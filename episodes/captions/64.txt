[00:00:00] This is Jockel Podcast number 64 with echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink. Good evening,
[00:00:07] echo. Good evening. In a country that most people would struggle to find on a map,
[00:00:17] in a compound that few possess the courage to enter, men from my previous life took the
[00:00:27] fight to our enemy. In that compound, they found men that pray five times a day for your
[00:00:38] destruction. Those praying men don't know me, they don't know you and they don't know America.
[00:00:49] They don't understand our compassion, our freedoms, and our tolerance. I know it may seem
[00:00:59] as if some of those things are currently missing, but they remain at our core and always
[00:01:07] will. Our capacity for them is boundless and is only dwarfed by the hatred in those men
[00:01:17] hiding in that compound, the hatred they have for you. Those men don't care about your religious
[00:01:27] beliefs, they don't care about your political opinions, they don't care if you sit on the left
[00:01:33] or the right liberal or conservative pacifist or warrior. They don't care how much you believe
[00:01:41] in diversity, equality, or freedom of speech. They don't care. I'm sorry you have never
[00:01:53] smelled the breath of a man who wants to kill you. I'm sorry you've never felt the alarm bells
[00:02:02] ringing in your body, the combination of fear and adrenaline as you move towards the fight,
[00:02:08] instead of running from it. I'm sorry you've never heard someone cry out for help or
[00:02:16] cried out for help yourself relying on the courage of others to bring you home.
[00:02:26] I'm sorry you've never tasted the salt from your own tears as you stand at flag draped
[00:02:32] coffins bearing men you are humbled to call your friends. I don't wish those experiences on you.
[00:02:45] But I do wish you had them. If you had them, it would change the way you act. It would change the
[00:02:57] way you value. It would change the way you appreciate. You would become quick to open your eyes
[00:03:06] and slow to open your mouth. Most will never understand the sacrifice required to keep evil men,
[00:03:16] like those from that distant compound away from our doorstep, but it would not hurt you to try and
[00:03:23] understand. It would not hurt you to take a moment to respect the sacrifices that others make
[00:03:30] on your behalf, whether they share your opinions or not. It would not hurt you to take a moment
[00:03:40] to think of the relentless drain on family, friends and loved ones that are left behind.
[00:03:46] Sometimes for weeks, sometimes for months, sometimes for years, sometimes forever.
[00:04:00] Ideas are not protected by words, paper and ink may outline the foundation and principles
[00:04:10] of this nation, but it is blood only blood that protects it. In that dusty compound,
[00:04:24] a man you have never met gave everything he had so that you have the freedom to think,
[00:04:31] speak and act, however you choose. He went there for all of us, whether you loved or hated
[00:04:43] what he stood for. He went there to preserve the opportunity and privilege to believe, to be,
[00:04:52] and to become what we want this country. Every single person living inside of its borders and
[00:05:04] under the banner of its flag, oh, that man, we owe that man everything. We owe him the respect
[00:05:15] that his sacrifice deserves. Saying thank you is not enough. We send our best and lose them
[00:05:29] in the fight against the worst evil this world has to offer. If you want to respect and honor
[00:05:36] their sacrifice, it needs to be more than words, you have to live it.
[00:05:41] Take a minute and look around, soak it in, all of it, the good, the bad, and the ugly.
[00:05:56] You have the choice every day as to which category you want to be in, in which direction you
[00:06:03] want to move. You have that choice because the best among us, the best we ever had to offer,
[00:06:14] fought and bled and died for it. Don't ever forget that. Now, those words were in a piece
[00:06:40] that was called a debt that cannot be repaid, which was written by a fellow seal.
[00:06:52] And the friend of mine named Andy Stumpf, when he heard that we had lost another frog there.
[00:07:02] Chief Ryan Owens during a daring raid on an al-Qaeda compound in Yemen.
[00:07:15] Then it was a very fitting tribute, another fitting tribute.
[00:07:24] Yet another fitting tribute to yet another great warrior who sacrificed everything for us.
[00:07:41] One of the hardest truths is that I know we know
[00:07:48] that this will not be the last great warrior to fall.
[00:08:01] And those warriors still on the line, close ranks, to fill the void left by the fallen
[00:08:10] and they continue to march forward, into the dark and into the dust looking for
[00:08:21] and hunting for evil. And those warriors, regardless of what they come up against,
[00:08:35] they will not stop.
[00:08:49] In this evening, while that punt continues and while evil lurks out there in the world,
[00:08:58] I am lucky enough to have one of the good guys here with me, the man that wrote those
[00:09:06] powerful words and that powerful tribute, as I said, a friend and a former seal teammate of mine,
[00:09:15] Andy Stumpf. Andy Stumpf, welcome to the show, brother. Thanks for having me, man.
[00:09:21] There was a grab a piece and really was and thank you for writing. I think they got around
[00:09:30] and I hope more people get to hear it now and spread it and share it about that, another brave warrior
[00:09:40] down. Yeah, it like we were going back and forth over text, I think took off like wildfire.
[00:09:48] I was eating breakfast with my sons and had received the news from buddy before it had broken
[00:09:55] on mainstream media and it was just one of those moments where I couldn't get the thoughts out of my
[00:10:02] head, so I cracked up on my laptop, literally took one stab at that, one pass and just hit the post button
[00:10:08] and walked away, came back four or five hours later and my phone was just exploding and yeah,
[00:10:16] I mean, it was cathartic for me to write it and I do hope that more people can understand the
[00:10:21] messes and take just two seconds out of their day to realize what's happening all around them,
[00:10:26] all around the world at any given time. And he given time, it's happening. Yep. The sacrifices are
[00:10:32] there and it's you know, speaking of social media, it's been a lot of people been requesting,
[00:10:37] they've been asking, do you know Andy Stumpf? And Andy Stumpf, do you know Jocco? So, yes,
[00:10:42] we do know each other that is confirmed and they've been asking you to come on the podcast,
[00:10:46] so thanks for coming on, man. I know, I know we haven't really seen a bunch of each other in the
[00:10:51] last few years, but I think it's been like five years. That's ridiculous. And for all those people
[00:10:56] who've been asking, you can stop now. Answer is yes, I know Jocco. We know each other for a while and here
[00:11:01] we are, stop. We're gonna go. Yeah, but I really appreciate you coming on. So let's get into a man.
[00:11:08] Let's talk about, let's talk about, you know, give us your basic background, you know, tell us about
[00:11:12] going up and Santa Cruz, what's up Santa Cruz? Man, what a great place to grow up. I mean, Santa Cruz
[00:11:18] is amazing with an asterix. And that asterix is whether or not at some point in time in your life,
[00:11:24] you leave Santa Cruz because it's a bubble. But for me, it was awesome. I have family roots there
[00:11:30] from not only my father, but my grandfather. They had one of the first construction companies there
[00:11:34] built the high school that my father attended. Built a lot of the infrastructure and also had a lot
[00:11:41] of ties to like law enforcement and firefighters, which would help me out when I would get rides home,
[00:11:45] when I would get in trouble. You know, advantages that other people didn't have. But I consider my,
[00:11:52] I mean, my background is very generic. I mean, I played Waterpull and Baseball in high school.
[00:11:59] I'd give myself a C as far as being an athlete, like very average junior lifeguard, so comfortable
[00:12:06] in and around the ocean, which was a skill that obviously paid off in training. You didn't
[00:12:09] surf. Did you surf in Santa Cruz? I did surf quite a bit and I'm sure you've surfed up there as you
[00:12:14] know, it's extremely territorial. Good waves. It's good waves, but like when you're 150 pounds,
[00:12:19] you know, in your 17, 18 years old, I've just really wasn't into, you know, fighting for waves.
[00:12:25] Yeah. So I'd surf a little bit, a little long board stuff down by cows, maybe steamers if it wasn't
[00:12:29] huge. And it just played sports. Yeah. I mean, it was super casual. We're from my dad's construction
[00:12:34] company. Santa Cruz has a dichotomy too in it in the fact that, especially when you were growing up,
[00:12:40] there was mad. Like, okay, there's that basically, I don't know if you want to call it the halves,
[00:12:44] they have knots, but we're not talking about money. We're talking about massive drug use, right?
[00:12:47] Still exists this day. Yeah. And it's, it's like an undercurrent that not a lot of people know about
[00:12:52] Santa Cruz. Most of the people who live in Santa Cruz don't work there. The money all comes from the
[00:12:56] Silicon Valley. They go over the highway 17. I mean, the median cost of homes in Santa Cruz. I
[00:13:01] think is near $800,000, which is crazy, because the city was kind of built around UC Santa Cruz.
[00:13:06] I mean, it's a college. I mean, here's going to for that stuff. But in the surfing scene,
[00:13:10] I mean, that's where a lot of the drug, from my understanding, that's where a lot of the drug
[00:13:13] stuff started. And then it just pushed itself out. It still exists. It's really bad.
[00:13:17] Yeah, it can be, it can be your rods. You, you'd think Santa Cruz is nice beach town,
[00:13:22] but it can be a rough town. I mean, you make a wrong turn. Yeah. You're going to be in trouble.
[00:13:25] But men in the same can be true here of San Diego or anywhere you may want to show.
[00:13:29] So when did you hear about when did you hear about the deems?
[00:13:32] Yeah, you're going to get it on. Yeah. You know, so I come from a military family. My grandfather was
[00:13:39] in the Navy. My father was in the Navy. He was a twin 50 calagoner on the Mark once in Vietnam.
[00:13:45] The first squadron of patrol boats with the Chikuzi jets, what she said had a failure rate of about
[00:13:50] 90% that had to be fun. And of course, they didn't fail at the time. But you had won them, too.
[00:13:54] Like pulling away from the dock right here. Yeah, no, just a middle of a firefight, you know,
[00:13:58] complex ambush. You're trying to get out of it. So you can, I mean, I don't think, I actually
[00:14:04] had no for a fact. My father did that work with seals. That's yeah, that's how I heard about it.
[00:14:10] My father probably didn't want me to join the military. I mean, I don't want my sons necessarily
[00:14:16] too. However, I would never stand in their way, just like my father allowed me to pursue
[00:14:20] what I wanted to do. But I started working for him when I was 11 and learned some of the best
[00:14:25] lessons in my life with bricks in my hands. Because he was a Mason and I basically moved bricks
[00:14:31] for a long time. But it was hard work and it paid off later in life. And I remember we were driving
[00:14:37] back from a job when I was 11. And he mentioned seals. And with no understanding of what they
[00:14:45] are, just his description of what they did, how they, he was, it was like, you know, they were in the
[00:14:50] water. They would get them onto the boats. They'd drop them off. It was intriguing to me. So it led me
[00:14:55] to trying to search for as much information as I could find out about them. And in the early 90s,
[00:14:59] the internet was not what it was today. So of course, I found the book that almost every team
[00:15:06] guys read, the men with green faces, all about Vietnam. But it's an awesome book. So I read that.
[00:15:13] And then unfortunately stumbled across the Rogue Warrior series, which as I was saying before we started,
[00:15:18] I made a mistake of thinking that it was a nonfiction work. And find out until a little bit
[00:15:24] later that that was incorrect. But I was hooked. From that moment on, it was every piece of
[00:15:30] information that I could find. It's all I wanted to do. It was like a magnetizing force.
[00:15:35] I don't have the vocabulary to describe it. People who don't come from our worlds, it's
[00:15:40] very uncommon for them to hear that. But you know, as well as I do, the seal teams is full of people
[00:15:45] with the same narrative. Oh, yeah, I've just always wanted to do this. It was a calling. But yeah,
[00:15:49] I mean, the idea was sparked from my dad. And I was 17, still in high school, at Junior in high
[00:15:56] school. And I went to the Navy recruiter and brought the Navy recruiter home because this my parents
[00:15:59] had to sign for me. And I had my mom who was an army brat and my dad who was, like I said,
[00:16:04] served in Vietnam. And I'm sure that they were not extremely excited, but they both signed for me.
[00:16:10] So I enlisted actually when I was a junior in high school in the left just a few days after
[00:16:14] a high school graduation. That's so legit. Yeah, who's awesome. And then since I look back now, I'm
[00:16:19] like, why did I do that? Why did I enlist a year early? All I did was give a recruiter. I filled
[00:16:23] their quota for the month. I couldn't leave. I was like, yeah, you got to still got to wait
[00:16:27] until I turn 18 and graduate. But that mean the recruiter was happy. But I mean, I never took the
[00:16:32] SATs. I had no plan B. It's what I knew I wanted to do. And I never even considered it.
[00:16:39] So we did. I enlisted August 1st of 96.
[00:16:44] Awesome. Yep. And so then you show the buds. Showed up for buds. January of 97. Get some winter.
[00:16:49] Were you still 18? I was 18. Yeah, I got some, uh, got some winter class action on.
[00:16:56] And from Santa Cruz. So it was not that great. Yeah, I never really laid an ocean for extended
[00:17:02] periods of time without a wetsuit. But you know what, even the training was everything that I
[00:17:08] thought it was going to be. I mean, I was happy to be there. And it hurt every single day. And it
[00:17:13] was extremely hard. Um, but God, I'd pay money. I'd give you every penny I have right now to go back.
[00:17:19] If I could turn back the clock right now, I would make exactly the same choice. It was up until
[00:17:23] that point in my life. Yeah. Maybe they would change a little bit later on. But until that point,
[00:17:26] we're still going on the same road. Yeah, I just, I had somebody asked me that the other day.
[00:17:32] Some kid, I was talking to some school kids and one of them said, you know,
[00:17:36] what can I do to get ready for seal training? I was like, man, seal training is awesome. You get
[00:17:40] paid. You work out. You literally work out all day long. They feed you three. If not four meals a day
[00:17:45] of all you can eat, just get after it. It's, it's awesome, man. It's so fun. With the aggressive
[00:17:51] A type motivated largely personalities surrounding you. It'll get better as obviously the
[00:17:57] days and weeks go on and training. Some of the people who shouldn't be there, weed it out. But
[00:18:01] and then even the teams, it's like it's, it can be everything that you want it to be. Yeah.
[00:18:05] So you show up. So you get done. You show up at the teams. Your new guy. How's that new guy?
[00:18:10] Experience. Man. Well, I don't know the statute of limitations on some of the things that
[00:18:16] were done to me. But I mean, again, but it was awesome. I was surrounded by my heroes. I didn't know
[00:18:22] anything about anything. I didn't realize that at the time. But because of your head, because
[00:18:28] in our heads, we know everything about everything. I had been to buzz in airborne school before
[00:18:33] bending. I am the most highly polished soldier in the world. Yeah. And you just FYI for those people
[00:18:40] that don't understand when you get done with buds and airborne school. You know nothing. You know nothing.
[00:18:47] You know nothing. You know nothing. You know nothing. You know nothing. And it's pretty ridiculous. That
[00:18:52] that it's got the people called. Yeah. People call buds at school. And again, you got to air
[00:18:56] quote that because you don't, you don't know how to be. Unless another one I get all the time. You don't,
[00:19:01] you're not a seal at the end of buds. I always tell people it stands for basic underwater
[00:19:04] demolition seal with the emphasis on the beat. It's basic. Yeah. You can run and do pull ups and
[00:19:10] you look great with shorts on a beach. I mean, but you don't know anything. Yeah. So, I mean,
[00:19:16] I checked in, you know, pre-notta 11. Although they are better now. I just, I have to say that.
[00:19:20] They're way better now. I was talking to some guys that recent graduates that are now in the
[00:19:25] pipeline. They're getting trained. And I told them. I said, you guys are getting trained infinitely
[00:19:31] better than what we got infinitely better. Now, it has to do with the timeframe that you and I came in.
[00:19:36] Yeah. 90s. There was no, there was a few very few Vietnam veterans left. You milk what you could
[00:19:42] out of them, but you weren't going to get like now every single guy that's teaching every single
[00:19:45] buds instructor all combat veterans that have experience. So it's a different game now. And I
[00:19:50] say that we were taught infinitely better than the people before us. I'm glad to see that that
[00:19:54] cycle repeats itself. And then it's a matter of technology and understanding. And I mean, they've
[00:19:58] changed the pipeline a little bit, especially what happens after buds. Because I went to team five.
[00:20:04] And we did our own tried and bored. And we did our own trading. And then you could talk to the guys
[00:20:10] like down at team three, they're like, oh, yeah, we didn't do any of that. Flaw, which just means
[00:20:15] I'm better than you. Obviously, nobody. Yeah, there's no competitive nature of the teams at all.
[00:20:21] But I mean, it was, I mean, I looked at these guys who had been in SEALs for like five,
[00:20:26] six, seven, eight years or there was like a Vietnam vet walking around like you're just,
[00:20:29] I just wanted to breathe the same air as those people. And I mean, it's a you realize incredibly
[00:20:35] fast that you don't know anything. You realize that because you get taped up for your mistakes.
[00:20:42] Because you're, you're reinforced every time that you make a mistake. And this is like,
[00:20:46] I couldn't do anything right for like years. Because I didn't know anything. The biggest,
[00:20:51] it had been fighting an enemy. I would have been more of a danger to the people that I was with.
[00:20:55] Then the enemy that we were fighting, it just, yeah, I mean, I tell people it takes five to
[00:20:59] seven years, even understand what it really means to be a SEAL. And then probably at the 10 year
[00:21:04] mark, you're at the top of the bell curve as far as what you're going to be able to do operationally.
[00:21:09] But still, I mean, I was in heaven. I was in my, I was, I wasn't even 21 yet, living in an apartment in
[00:21:14] Coronado, riding a bike to the world. Well, until I got paid, yeah, I'm going to be the course guy
[00:21:22] today, it's after the. It is, it is like, for most guys that come in on a high school, because
[00:21:27] we're in your high school, you know, even if you're working at Wendy's, yeah, like I did,
[00:21:32] you're only making whatever 425 an hour in that amount. So you know, whatever, you know,
[00:21:36] you're making like 80 bucks every two weeks. You show up in the teams. And all of a sudden,
[00:21:42] they're giving you real, legit money. You're, they're filling your pocket every two weeks. You are the
[00:21:47] richest you are. Kid in the world. Not a few new guys, because you're paying for everything.
[00:21:52] By the way, you buy some beers. Buy some beers. I learned a lot of stuff in bars,
[00:21:58] over beers. Learned a lot of, I mean, you listen to a lot of history. You learn a lot of
[00:22:04] bouts yourself. You learn when you should keep your mouth shut, because they get shut for you.
[00:22:07] I've been taped up in a bar. Maybe. It's the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the,
[00:22:14] hazing was pretty good in teams back then. Yeah. Reinforcement. Less reinforcements. So you need a
[00:22:19] couple of deployments, couple deployments. Two pre-9 11 deployments. Uh, and you know, again, the
[00:22:25] life is a new guy is amazing. Like, here's a rifle. It's yours. And then my first department I
[00:22:30] worked in was as a secondary calm guy. So I think I had like a PRC 77. But like rotary, you know, rotary dials
[00:22:39] and whip antenna. I hadn't even been to comm school. But it's like, this is my stuff. And I got,
[00:22:43] remember going getting issued my first set of gear that I look back at now. And it's like, I couldn't
[00:22:48] sell it if I wanted to. So antiquated. But I was so happy to be where I was. And we, you know,
[00:22:55] we'd train for 18 months. And we'd deploy first six. But my first deployment was to Japan to the
[00:23:00] Kadina Air Force Base. And we experimented with how much we could drink and how much we could work out.
[00:23:06] Like, which ratio is best? 80 to 20, 70, 30. And we'd go train our partner forces. But I mean,
[00:23:13] we just, I mean, we lived life hard. It was exactly the brotherhood that I thought it was
[00:23:19] be. I was surrounded by my best friends. We all had the same drive. You could have told us that
[00:23:24] go build sandcastles. We would have had the best sandcastles in the world because we just go and
[00:23:28] go and go and go and go. And so we get it right. Surrounded by like-minded motivated people
[00:23:32] come back. Did another 18 month work up? Is like a kind of new guy, one platoon wonder?
[00:23:39] Well, a few will. If you will, again, you know about 20% but you think you know about 80. The ratio is
[00:23:46] just a skew. Went through the whole work up again and then deployed the Guam for six months.
[00:23:52] And then to the same time, we'd go to Australia for a bit. We train with the partner forces
[00:23:56] there. We'd go to the Thailand. We'd go to Philippines. And then we'd go back and we'd just train
[00:24:00] and talk about how awesome we were going to be when the big mesh. Remember the Golden Connide
[00:24:04] Sparks? Yeah. Big mesh in the Golden Connide. Actually, Lately, Lately, if I've talked about that on
[00:24:08] here, you know, back in the day, pre especially pre 9-11, we were all preparing for the one
[00:24:15] big mesh. And that was going to go down the big mesh. Yeah. And you know how- and what was interesting
[00:24:22] is because we didn't have any combat experience, at least from my perspective, we trained
[00:24:27] freaking hard because we thought like it was going to be even harder than anything we could
[00:24:32] imagine. We don't know how hard it's going to be. So we're just going to be like, it's not saying
[00:24:34] castles because we were to prepare for that hard too. But it's real. This is what we're prepared for.
[00:24:38] So we trained as hard as we possibly could in every arena. To be ready for whatever was going
[00:24:45] to come, which we had no idea. I don't know if I've talked about this before, but we finally got
[00:24:50] my first deployment. My first deployment deployed the Guam. Yeah. I'm ready for the big mesh
[00:24:54] bro. Totally. I'm ready. It's going down from where we get there. We get there and we have,
[00:25:01] you know, we get issued beepers. So you know, it's real now because you're getting issued beepers.
[00:25:06] Because this back in the day, the whole girl had beepers back then. Unless you, unless
[00:25:10] some shit was going to go down. So they give us the beepers and we're like ready to rock and roll.
[00:25:15] And finally, actually, I was surfing and I come in and someone's waving one of my buddies waving
[00:25:20] him in the beach like, hey, I run up. Let's go on. Hey, we got a page. We got a page. We got a page.
[00:25:25] We know we get the 911 page. Oh, I think. John, get the, but we get, get, get, get, get, get, get,
[00:25:30] get past the base. We get there. We get in the LPO sitting there. I look at his face and I go,
[00:25:36] this doesn't look like the kind of face I anticipated. And I've been in Guam. This is my first
[00:25:42] deployment. I'm two days into Guam. So I think, man, this is exactly like were you saying?
[00:25:47] Yeah, blue one. It's going to be like, of course, man. I just got on the boyman. It's going down.
[00:25:53] So no president knows that I'm on deployment. He's ready. Yeah. We're going to action that
[00:25:56] target. So what I failed to mention was that we were like our second or third day in Guam, the first
[00:26:00] day in Guam that we were there. We went inside and didn't know weapons. So we got a recall emergency
[00:26:06] recall 911 go back into base. Guess what we didn't do. We didn't clean up our brass. So I'm not kidding.
[00:26:12] We went and cleaned up our brass. They, they made it. They recall the emergency recall. The
[00:26:16] go clean up our brass on the range. After that, the beer's got cracked open and it went sideways.
[00:26:24] Real quick for the rest of that deployment. But isn't an amazing what used to constitute an emergency.
[00:26:32] Yeah, that was a rough one. Oh, man. So you end up, so those are your couple pre 9-11,
[00:26:39] the point where were you in September 11th happened. It's a station that's a team five still and I was living in
[00:26:46] the archstone apartments right by the Ikea in Mission Valley. Watch the second one, go in live.
[00:26:52] Yeah, I remember it was living with the buddy and my wife we've been married for six months
[00:27:00] and watched the second one go in live. And then you knew immediately. Did you know,
[00:27:04] did you think, do you think, were you thinking on the first one? Because I wasn't the first one.
[00:27:07] I didn't see the first one going live. I turned it on just in time to see the second one.
[00:27:10] But I think it caught most people. Like the first one they're like, oh, well, that pilot's probably
[00:27:14] in trouble. I'm going to be a lawsuit on that one. And then the second one there was no doubt whatsoever.
[00:27:19] And I didn't know, I mean, looking back, I didn't have the mental capacity to understand the
[00:27:25] difference that it would have in my life. But I knew that something was going to be different. I mean,
[00:27:29] I think I realized that we were passing from the conceptual phase to the practical phase of what we
[00:27:34] had trained to do for a really long period of time. You know, who didn't know that. So the
[00:27:39] deed, the officer, because I was going to college at the time. And I called the officer detailer,
[00:27:43] who is a friend of mine, who I knew, who I'd work for, who is an outstanding guy. And I called them up
[00:27:48] and I was like, hey, sir, I'm in college. Get me out of college. I'll finish online. I'll do something.
[00:27:53] Just get me out of here. Send me to a team immediately. Please. Yeah. Please. And he, and he says to me,
[00:27:59] Joko, don't worry. This war is going to last a long, long time. And of course, I didn't believe
[00:28:06] him. Yeah. But damn what's he right. He was, but I mean, I can only imagine being in your shoes.
[00:28:10] I would have been like, I don't really care. This is what my calling in life is to be. I don't,
[00:28:14] I don't care if I'm in line to get the Nobel Prize for something like we'll just put that on the show.
[00:28:18] Yeah. I'll come back and get it. Nobel what? Yeah. Like season war going on. Yeah. And
[00:28:23] so you get done with that. And then shortly thereafter, you ship out to the East Coast, right?
[00:28:29] Yep. Go out to the East Coast and did the vast majority of my combat deployments out there.
[00:28:37] And wow. I mean, what an eye opening experience. You know, it's from, like I said, going from conceptual
[00:28:44] shooting at paper targets and training hard and realistic to to be in on a two-way range
[00:28:50] for the first time. I mean, the first target I ever was on. I think my helicopter had 27 rounds in it.
[00:29:00] And the door going to got shot in the face right in front of me. And I'm in mom level four.
[00:29:05] Yeah, for those of you that are that's what that is. That's the chemical biological and
[00:29:11] radiological suit to protection that you wear and highest level four is you're wearing your mask.
[00:29:18] You're wearing everything. So it's it's horrible, uncomfortable, miserable thing to do. And we had a
[00:29:26] four hour 47 flight on the way to the objective. And 30 minutes out, we got all of our stuff onto
[00:29:32] include our gas masks and the blowers. The always going to say if you're the blowers. That does make it a lot nicer.
[00:29:36] Well, I'll push, push, weapon strap over those. I like it. Go on for days about mistakes. I've made
[00:29:45] it my life. So yeah, I was skip breathing and occasionally the glass would touch my eyeball. That's
[00:29:50] not a good and breathe. But I mean, this is my first real target ever. And it's, uh, we're hitting the
[00:29:57] number one, chem bio target in Iraq right after the war kicked off. And I was on the third 47 that
[00:30:04] came in and they blew the power grid. Uh, but an eight-end strike, uh, before we landed and then they landed
[00:30:11] the helicopters in between the fireball in the city. So we were backlit. So each subsequent helicopter
[00:30:16] that came in took more rounds. And by the time ours came in, they started taking rounds at about a minute
[00:30:21] out. I didn't even know what they were. I'm just sitting there looking through straws, you know,
[00:30:26] through my gas mask, through my night vision goggles, suffocating myself because my weapon strap
[00:30:31] is over the hose. It's supposed to be giving me the air. Uh, and, you know, there was some sparks.
[00:30:37] Nobody, nobody heard them bird. Not a single one of our guys shot. And then right before we touched
[00:30:42] down, the door gunner just falls over. And then, you know, the top of the head kind of came off and
[00:30:47] tied my, you know, tied my jacket around his head and they just took off. And away we went
[00:30:52] on our first combat operation. But the whole thing was just surreal. And that, that leap,
[00:30:58] I didn't realize how surreal was till the next morning when I woke up at a slight
[00:31:02] time. Man, I hope this is survival. Because that was just one of many in the target deck. And
[00:31:09] it continued for months and then years. And, you know, two decades now. Yeah. And it was,
[00:31:17] and it took me a little bit of time to get up and running to be, to be comfortable in that environment.
[00:31:23] But I, I developed a level of comfort in that environment. And if I'm being totally honest, I mean,
[00:31:28] I loved it. I loved it. It was, I mean, I understand that it's high-cost,
[00:31:36] quince, and that it's high-risk, and that there's matters of life and death and decisions that
[00:31:40] are being made. But that's where I want to be. I mean, I was like, yes, this is what I came to do
[00:31:47] to fight for the values that I believe in and to fight for people who can't fight for themselves.
[00:31:52] And it was awesome. Loved it.
[00:31:54] It's interesting how you talk about that transition from like, from training, which what we all
[00:32:02] lived, there's very few people that this is another thing that taught people, it's hard for people
[00:32:06] understand about, especially about the early days of the sea of, well, for us the early days, the
[00:32:10] sealtains is, there was so few people that actually had combat experience. And that went all the way up
[00:32:15] to the leadership, a lot of leadership had no combat experience. And so for us, all of a sudden,
[00:32:20] in a very quick learning curve, you know, you spend two weeks on deployment, you had more combat
[00:32:26] experience than, you know, than anybody else in the sealtains at that time, you know, other than the
[00:32:30] guys that were deployed right before you, but you had that's how quick the learning curve was.
[00:32:34] And things were changing. I mean, look at what we trained. I mean, we were doing OTV and exhaustion
[00:32:39] drag or dives, and I'm doing river and stream crossing in Nile and. But I'm not kidding before my
[00:32:44] first deployment to Iraq. I took my seal platoon. We went on board of an amphibious landing ship in San Diego
[00:32:52] and went and no kidding did lead line and slate beach reconnaissance at Camp Pendleton. That was,
[00:32:59] that was less than, it might have been a month and a half before deploying to Iraq to do operations.
[00:33:06] That's how, that's, that's, that's the lag time in the big bureaucratic machine in the military.
[00:33:10] Hey, you know, we got this big fleet exercise. You guys can go participate in one of
[00:33:14] one of our, one of my guys in that platoon. I come down and go, hey, break out your lead line
[00:33:22] and slate. So again, for those of you that don't know, there's the very prehistoric type operation.
[00:33:27] That was to excellent descriptor. Yeah. It's war. It came from World War II. It came after the
[00:33:33] battle of Tarolotaro at the battle of Tarolotaro, the Marines went in and as they went into the
[00:33:38] beaches in their landing craft, they hit reef and they opened the gates of the landing craft. The
[00:33:45] Marines got out and unfortunately the reef ended and so these, these Marines went out and they went
[00:33:49] into, you know, 10, 12, 15 feet of water instead of two feet of water and many, many Marines were
[00:33:55] to have the gear that was not buoyant, so it was not designed for swimming. It was, it was meant
[00:34:00] for beats landing not for swim. Anyways, that was kind of the one of the precursors to the UDTs and
[00:34:06] what, so what our predecessors used to do is go in with a lead line, which is a piece of string
[00:34:12] with a lead on the bottom of it and it's got little marks on it called buntings, little marks on it
[00:34:18] that tell you how deep it is and you go in as a big team and you drop these lead lines and you
[00:34:22] figure out how deep and your slate is a piece of plexiglass that's been sanded down and you
[00:34:27] right with a pencil on it, how deep it was in this particular location. So they're trying to do calculus
[00:34:32] with an abacus. So we are, you know, like less than two months from deploying to Iraq for the first
[00:34:40] time, none of us had ever been in combat, but not one single person, zero, not one single person
[00:34:44] in my siopton had ever been in combat before, including our task in a commander, no one. And so we say,
[00:34:51] oh, you know what we need to do right now is we're going to do a hydrographic reconnaissance
[00:34:55] officer called with lead line and say, but one of the guys might be, what are you walking,
[00:34:58] you do what are you talking about? And I go, bro, we're just going to do it and it was like,
[00:35:03] you've got to be kidding me, what is wrong with us? But so that learning curve was fast, but then
[00:35:08] it, but I also to kind of emphasize what you're saying and I look at it, when you said, you know,
[00:35:14] your first like platoon, you know, like 20% and then your second platoon, you know, for me,
[00:35:20] because I have four kids, it's very similar to what you learn with kids. Yes. Your first kid,
[00:35:24] you're like, oh, wait, what? You don't know how to do anything, everything is hard, you know,
[00:35:27] you're worried about everything. Your second kid, you're like, I'm pretty pretty much going to go.
[00:35:31] Your third kid, you're like, okay, you know, I think we're comfortable. Your fourth kid,
[00:35:34] you're like, I got this, what I was before. I was like, hey, first kid, go take care of your sibling.
[00:35:38] Exactly, which is really, which is really exactly what you're doing the teams, you're like, hey,
[00:35:42] you know, one cruise wonder, go show that new guy, what's up, because you don't have to do it anymore,
[00:35:46] and you want them to learn the experience. But that's the same thing with the combat operations
[00:35:51] that you do and over, you know, a period of a couple weeks also, and you go from being,
[00:35:56] you know, I'll give you another good example from my perspective. My first deployment to Iraq,
[00:36:03] when every operation we would go on, like the first, like, let's call it five or seven operations
[00:36:08] that I did. Every piece of gear that had to change the batteries, change the battery,
[00:36:11] my nonsense, my laser change battery, my flash, change every single bit. I need a brand new battery
[00:36:16] and every one of these pieces of gear. Well, I was doing it, because that's when we talked about
[00:36:20] the big mission, that's what we would think, you know, what I got to have this 100%. We realized
[00:36:25] after a week, if everyone does that, we're not going to have any batteries left in another two weeks.
[00:36:30] And so we all realize, you know what, you're going to have to use that battery and keep track of
[00:36:34] how long you're using it for, because you don't want it to fail, but you're going to get, you know,
[00:36:37] 12 or 15 or 25 uses out of this thing. But that's the kind of lessons that we learned,
[00:36:42] and that's the kind of comfort level. You got, like, okay, if my nods fail, I'll stop, I'll put a new
[00:36:46] battery and my nods and we'll move on. So those are the kind of things that you learn in that steep learning
[00:36:52] curve that all of us are whole generation went through that real quick. And you only learn that
[00:36:56] with time in the saddle, like it takes experience to understand like, okay, I can use this lithium
[00:37:03] battery that probably costs $9.00. I didn't turn it on the whole time, and I'm going to hook it,
[00:37:08] you know, I think I can use it again. I mean, but I mean, everything changed. The tactics changed.
[00:37:13] But you're changed. The way we trained change. It was amazing what happened post 911. All the
[00:37:19] stuff we thought was going to be crazy effective because it worked in Vietnam. Guess what?
[00:37:23] Doesn't work in the desert. Let me ask you this. When you say that you only learned it in the saddle,
[00:37:29] when you were, when you went through training, when I was, when I was running training,
[00:37:34] do you were able to convey a lot of that information of those guys, though? I tried.
[00:37:39] I think I think you were, and maybe you couldn't give me every single little tiny thing. But what I'm
[00:37:43] saying is there was no one to teach us that stuff. Yes. In for me it was in 2003, there was no one to say,
[00:37:51] hey, you don't need to change your battery on every operation. You're going to need those batteries
[00:37:54] you need to make them last. So we did get, we did get some fundamental knowledge back from, for sure,
[00:38:01] from those early times. And then you still got to add that experience, though. The people, I mean,
[00:38:05] like you can, you could read a book, and then go do it for real, and you need to combination of
[00:38:10] the two to have that confidence, and then you can impart it on somebody else. And history, just,
[00:38:15] like, like you said, the Vietnam guys, like they were just timed out. We didn't have access to that.
[00:38:20] And I, I look at the pre-None 11 training that we did. It was awesome. But it don't give me wrong.
[00:38:27] I loved it. But man, it doesn't work in Baghdad. Yeah. And then that we had a tactical shift again,
[00:38:33] and probably, 2006, 2007. It's, it's that, I think, is what separates our community from a lot of
[00:38:40] other ones. Like we're malleable. But we have leadership that's like, listen, this isn't working in
[00:38:44] real time. We need to create a solution for it right now. And we're willing to do that. We have just a
[00:38:49] little bit more control of the wheel. Yeah. Well, part of the reason is because we had no doctor.
[00:38:54] Yeah. We're as the other service branch as many of them have this beautiful, really well
[00:39:00] written doctrine on this is how you do this type of operation. And we didn't have that. So guess
[00:39:05] what, for us to say, you know what, that didn't work yesterday. We're going to change it today.
[00:39:08] They didn't have that capability. They were like, hey, this is the way we do it. Yeah.
[00:39:12] And we never really had this the way we do it. I mean, they came up before trade it. I was a team five,
[00:39:17] right? So we would go to Alaska and do coal weather training. And the team three guys were off
[00:39:20] driving DPV. I mean, there wasn't even talking in between the team. So there was so much skill set.
[00:39:26] And of course, I mean, if you were a team through, I wasn't telling you shit. I'd give you the wrong
[00:39:31] information. You know, because we're computing with ourselves. But yeah, that like you said no
[00:39:36] doctorate, then finally we had, you know, the trade at East Coast West Coast and, you know,
[00:39:41] sharing information and coming together and lessons learned and all that stuff that I think largely
[00:39:46] professionalize the force from a paperwork perspective, but has impact on the battlefield as well,
[00:39:50] too. It's not sexy and it's not fun, but it keeps people alive.
[00:39:54] No, there's no doubt about that. The amount of interoperability we would do as the different training
[00:39:58] departments was was awesome. It was awesome. And bouncing lessons learned in the feedback loop
[00:40:03] with that we got going was definitely far superior to anything. Then like you said,
[00:40:08] when we had the teams going all the different areas and not talking to each other.
[00:40:11] I mean, I got issued overwights at team five. They wouldn't issue us tan bdUs because we were
[00:40:17] a Southwest Asia, put you. And I'd look at the guys wearing the chocolate chips. My god,
[00:40:21] I'll get a pair of those. I'll trade you for these woodland cameras.
[00:40:27] It's just a different world. But I'm actually extremely grateful that I got to see both sides of
[00:40:33] the coin because if you never got to see that evolution, you're missing a huge piece of who we are
[00:40:38] as a community. And also I believe it would be easier that you would that we could let it slip back
[00:40:45] in that direction if we don't like we said capture those lessons and be able to pass them on.
[00:40:51] So how many then you got out of these course? How many departments did you do out there?
[00:40:56] I bounced back and forth from Iraq to Afghanistan for basically four years straight.
[00:41:01] It would be everything between three to four months. There were shorter in duration.
[00:41:08] So I ended up in my career I've been to Iraq three times and I've got to stand five.
[00:41:14] And at one point there, you kind of got a little setback.
[00:41:18] Yeah. Equated to going to Vegas and you can play crops for a really long time and you can be on a
[00:41:24] great heater and then a seven is going to come up in Baitje and hopefully you don't have a lot of
[00:41:28] chips on the table. Yeah, I got shot from about 15 feet away by a guy in a window that I
[00:41:38] didn't see and I was staring at that window for 10 minutes before I was sitting on a ladder looking
[00:41:43] into a courtyard where they were trying to determine which building was the one that we were actually
[00:41:49] going to make entry on. The determined that the building that I was looking at was the one we were
[00:41:55] going to make entry into. Actually, I get it back up a little bit. So we walked by this building originally.
[00:41:59] The lights were off because I was walking point at the time. So we went down an alley.
[00:42:04] You know, we're not always the best. And then just we made a little bit of noise. So a guy
[00:42:08] comes out of a house. We pursued him into the house and made additional noise while we were doing
[00:42:13] that securing that to make sure that maybe it wasn't the guy. We weren't exactly positive
[00:42:18] of the location. So maybe that could have been the guy. So it wasn't and we backtracked and went back
[00:42:22] down that alley. And the guys who were doing the they were fixing the target trying to determine
[00:42:29] which building it was going to be. They needed some time. So I threw ladder up on a wall because
[00:42:32] I'm not a huge fan of not being able to see over things. Climbed up on the ladder was just looking
[00:42:36] at the outside of a building. And the lights were on this time, which defeats a lot of the
[00:42:41] technological advantage that I have. So I was kind of just looking underneath my nods.
[00:42:46] And I could see plainly into the window. I never saw a shadow. I never saw a curtain move. I never saw
[00:42:52] anything. They finally gave me the go ahead, hopped off the ladder. And I remember being in the corner
[00:42:58] of the courtyard by myself for a little bit before two other guys came over with me. And I almost
[00:43:04] approached the door on my own because I had before. And it was dark and I had the shadows and it was
[00:43:10] kind of like an American house where there was like an L. The long end of the L being the garage
[00:43:16] and then there's that path that goes to the front door and then it breaks off and then there's
[00:43:19] that window right there. And that was the window I was looking at. And I was just going to go to the
[00:43:22] corner to set security for the breach. And I almost left the shadows. It's like, you know what? Not the
[00:43:28] day. So I waited for two more guys to come up. And right at that corner that I was going to post my
[00:43:33] self up on, there was a window. And I was going to turn my back on the window without taking at least
[00:43:37] a quick peek in it. And as soon as I turned my head to look in that window, I heard a crack and
[00:43:45] the round hit me high up on the hip and spun me. And then this is only time I've ever felt
[00:43:49] into my life. The truce sensation of time slowing down. It really, it was, it was almost like
[00:43:54] the movies. It's probably the only thing I can say was ever like the movies. But it slowed down
[00:43:59] and spun me towards him. And when it hit, I pushed off a little bit with my right foot. I think
[00:44:03] just instinctually, and I kind of pushed me down. And there was a vehicle in the driveway. And I ended up
[00:44:09] stuck underneath the vehicle. I had a shotgun on my right hand side and the bungee cord got stuck on
[00:44:13] the undercarriage. I'm laying on top of my gun. Can't get it staring at full auto fire from like
[00:44:20] 15 feet away out of a window. Guys, just up on his knees, just hoesing. And probably three seconds
[00:44:28] occurred. I expired. And obviously all hell broke loose from people on our side engaging the window.
[00:44:36] They made entry from the other side. End up having, I think it was eight American servicemen
[00:44:40] get wounded on that target alone. Some of it was our guys were too close to a breach. I mean,
[00:44:46] a lot of it was, it was some fog of war stuff from a unit that you wouldn't associate necessarily
[00:44:52] with the fog of war. But it, you know, it happens. I associate the fog of war with all units
[00:45:00] unfortunately. Yeah. But you know, it's a, some of them would, it surprises you at some levels
[00:45:04] more than others. And it was, you know, they were trying, they wanted to get internal. They
[00:45:08] want to get the breach on the door. Get the breach on the door. So we put a C6 strip charge up,
[00:45:12] which is a very large explosive charge that runs the length of the door. Put it on the hinge side.
[00:45:16] And when they set it off, there was a unit that had entered on the other side of the building without
[00:45:20] telling anybody standing about three feet from it. So there was some people who were shot on the
[00:45:24] inside. There were some people were shot on the outside. And then there were some people who were
[00:45:27] to hurt from the explosion. So they had little birds coming in, grabbing people. I ended up getting
[00:45:32] thrown in the back of a Bradley with a guy who jabbed me with a 14 gauge needle and hadn't
[00:45:39] prep the bag. So he pulled it back out and I told him at that point you're done with any medical
[00:45:43] treatment at this point. I'll handle my own stuff from here on out. Really like an army medic,
[00:45:48] he was just shaking. I'm like, you're good. I'm going to live, I think. So just take it easy. Take it
[00:45:54] easy. But I mean, I didn't do anything differently that night that I hadn't done before, hundreds of times.
[00:46:00] You know, I was on the wrong side of the bullet. And it it actually really rocked my confidence.
[00:46:07] It was I was young. I was my mid-20s where I wanted to be operating at the level that I wanted to
[00:46:13] be operating at. And I mean, I couldn't walk from a senior. I had hemopolizeia like paralysis
[00:46:19] of one side of my leg. I had dropped foot for a year. Is that because it obviously hit nerves then?
[00:46:23] They don't know if it, I mean, they don't know. It either hit the sciatic nerve as it went through
[00:46:28] or the shockwave short circuit either way. The result was the same. It fried it all the way down to
[00:46:35] my ankle. So when I was in the back, when I got to the hospital in the green zone, my biggest complaint
[00:46:39] was that my ankle felt like it was snapped in half. And like I still have never had a surgery,
[00:46:45] never broken a bone. Everything is still inside of my pelvis. They just wrapped the wound with ace
[00:46:51] wrap and drugged me out of the compound. I mean, that's literally it. And then they went back to business.
[00:46:55] But I thought that I was like my ankle has got to be destroyed somehow. So they cut my boot off
[00:47:03] like very gingerly and they're looking at it and they're like your ankle is totally fine. But that was
[00:47:06] by far the worst part of it was the the neuropathic issues for like a year and a half. Almost two
[00:47:12] years. I felt like my dip my leg and gasoline and just lit it on fire 24, 7. And so the Navy, I mean,
[00:47:18] I had like 14, 15 pill bottles. I mean, I was taken two, three, four ambient staying awake.
[00:47:24] Of course, then we went up that game as to combine with Captain Morgan, which I did in a variety of
[00:47:30] dosages. So I would sleep at wake up exhaust. I mean, it was it was rough. It rocked me as a person
[00:47:38] and as as a seal. I didn't know if I was going to come back from it. Where were you stationed at that time?
[00:47:46] Were you still out on the east coast or did you go to the east coast? I went to Buds
[00:47:50] as a basically a break to rehab myself. And I mean, like so I was even still today. I can't
[00:47:57] fill my left leg from the kneecapped out. I roll my ankle all the time. I'm just used to,
[00:48:01] I'm used to it. I know what you, you somehow compensate for the best you can. Yeah, I mean, I'm
[00:48:05] very, I don't do any like lateral stuff because if I catch my left foot to the outside, that's
[00:48:10] the role that I can't stop is the one at the outside. So I mean, I still train as hard. If not
[00:48:14] harder than I used to, I'm just super cautious with what it is that I do. And I tailor it all towards
[00:48:19] the stuff that I do now. But yeah, you want to talk about, you know, you watch all these movies where
[00:48:24] you know, guys are just getting drilled and they're running at it. Like, I'm going to be the biggest
[00:48:28] warrior ever and like, I was flat on my back. I mean, I was freaking done training. There's nothing
[00:48:32] I could do. Pinned under a car, needed a buddy mind to come over and pull me around in the middle of
[00:48:36] firefight to get me out of, oh, I got a harms way. I mean, I got super lucky. The belt, I was
[00:48:42] wearing that night has the second round that the guy shot at me. It burned the belt for like two
[00:48:47] inches and then the copper jacket is still in the belt itself. That's how close I got to getting hit
[00:48:52] even higher up in the hip. Like the pelvis, I don't think I would have survived that one if that would
[00:48:56] hit me because there's an AK from like three times the distance from me to you right now. It was spicy.
[00:49:03] So when you they're just, I mean, I'm not trying to say anything super negative about the care
[00:49:10] that you got. But they're like, okay, take this pill, take this pill, take this pill, take the ear
[00:49:14] and give us this pill. It was early. So I was, I got home about two days after it happened.
[00:49:22] They flew me. They met a vacuum to launch stool. I decided I didn't want to stay there. So I
[00:49:27] checked myself out and got a delta ticket and flew into New York. I got picked up by another plane
[00:49:32] and my wife met me at the stairs of the aircraft in Oshana, the Naval Air Station there with my
[00:49:40] son in a stroller and she was pregnant with our second child. And about a week after that,
[00:49:46] my arresting heart rate was sitting at like 150. I was sweating, profusely, in a ton of pain and they
[00:49:52] take me to the hospital. And I remember talking to like this, I think I was in E5 at the time.
[00:50:00] So I was talking to this little punk E2 corpsman who is checking me in. And he was like, you know,
[00:50:05] what's the nature of injury? I'm like, you know, gunshot wound to the hip and I kid you not. He's,
[00:50:10] he's like riding the stuff down. He stops. He looks him and he goes self-inflicted.
[00:50:19] And my wife sitting there looking at this, she's just like, what's going on? Like, she has very
[00:50:24] little understanding of the military medical system. I sat in the waiting room while they took
[00:50:29] people in with the sniffles and the flu for four hours before they took me in. And my wife finally
[00:50:36] just started losing her mind on them and like, you know, it was a training hospital as most military
[00:50:41] hospitals are they had never seen a gunshot wound? Because it was relatively early in the war,
[00:50:47] you know, given where we were at that time and they wanted to have all the doctors, all the
[00:50:51] residents come in, they're like, hey, can they come in and check out the wound? Like, we've never seen
[00:50:55] a gunshot wound. I'm like sure, if you bring a pint of morphine with you and juice me up for us,
[00:51:00] I don't care what you do. Like, I just couldn't sleep. I was in so much pain. The treatment that I
[00:51:06] got from the military was not awesome. It was frustrating at the time. But I-
[00:51:13] This is just to make sure this is 0.5, right? 0.5. Yeah, early 0.5. It wasn't awesome. They
[00:51:18] weren't used to seeing a lot of that stuff. Yeah, I got pills and I got sent home and kind of
[00:51:23] largely left to my own devices, which was not a smart call at the time. I mean, in my career,
[00:51:30] I felt like I was a race car in 5th year going around, turned four and then somebody dumped the
[00:51:34] training into reverse and there was just pieces everywhere. And I had to kind of put it back together
[00:51:38] myself and it sucked at the time. My wife still, I mean, she's pissed about the the treatment that I got.
[00:51:46] But I mean, the military did what they were doing at that time. You know, I don't hold them against it.
[00:51:50] I don't hold it against them at all. But it sucked for sure. And I do know we've made vast improvements.
[00:51:58] And you were one of the guys that the reason why there's been so many improvements, because,
[00:52:02] you know, guys will come back and getting the kind of treatment that they would definitely
[00:52:06] deserve better. You know, one of the worst things about the whole thing was actually the flight out
[00:52:12] of the mod and a C141 full of stretchers of people that were wounded far worse than I was just
[00:52:20] the noises that were being made on that flight from blood to landstool. I was very fortunate.
[00:52:27] I had a doc who was assigned to me. And I was just like, hey, knock me out. Right. Oh, I don't want
[00:52:32] to hear this anymore. And I had the guy just basically just juice me up until I fell asleep for the whole
[00:52:36] flight. But what an experience that you'll never forget, just a tube full of bleeding
[00:52:44] Americans, you know, on their way back to try to put their lives back together. People missing.
[00:52:50] I mean, I was right next to a guy who was standing in a turret of a humvy,
[00:52:54] when a suicide bomb or clocked himself off, and every inch of his body from Beltline up was just
[00:52:59] completely tattered. I mean, another guy who had his legs blown off. I mean, like, I'm sitting there.
[00:53:04] I'm like, I'm like, okay, I thought I was injured. You guys, you guys are way worse off than I am.
[00:53:10] It was a very sobering experience. How did you, so you go, you go kind of pretty far down the road of
[00:53:18] a losing pills. I'm okay. So you do some good recipes if you're interested. Three blues of red,
[00:53:25] two bottles of Captain Morgan. How did you, okay, we'll take it for granted that you went pretty
[00:53:31] far down there. I don't mean that, you know, you've got the team guy personality of, okay, I can't
[00:53:36] do this. So I'm going to, I can't do this to next stream. So I have two speakers. I have to go and stop.
[00:53:42] How did you figure out, okay, you know what, what was this lap in the face that made you say,
[00:53:46] you know, this is not where I want to be? I was in the car with my wife. So one of the pills that they
[00:53:52] gave me was Naurotton, which is anti seizure medicine for children, but it has a secondary or tertiary
[00:53:58] side effect, a side effect of a neuropathic pain control. It was an attempt to try to get that
[00:54:02] burning feeling to stop in my leg. And I kept signing waivers for the dosages, because they were,
[00:54:09] we were off the charts, like we were making medical history with the dosages that I was on.
[00:54:15] And another side effect of it is central nervous system suppression. And I remember going by the
[00:54:21] gasoline or, call by the gasoline, go by the gas station and looking at the sign for the prices of
[00:54:26] the gasoline. And my wife asked me a very rudimentary mathematical problem and I couldn't, I couldn't
[00:54:31] figure it out. And I'm certainly not the smartest guy in the world, but like I should be able to add
[00:54:36] two plus two and you know, maybe multiply that out a little bit and I couldn't do it and I recognize
[00:54:41] that in and of myself. So that night, I stopped drinking and basically started weaning myself
[00:54:50] off of the Naurotton, because you can't stop at cold turkey, because if you do, your propensity
[00:54:56] for seizures goes through the roof. So you had, you got to graduate yourself out of it, so it took
[00:55:00] me like six to eight months to get myself off of Naurotton off all the pills. And I just started
[00:55:06] working out like a maniac. And that's how I got myself. I did it all in my own, I didn't get on any
[00:55:11] protocol from the Navy, but I remember that moment where I just couldn't answer that question.
[00:55:15] I was like, okay, time to shift course. And you know, a lot of people always, a lot of people ask
[00:55:20] about, you know, when you're injured, what they ask me, what are you doing? What are you doing?
[00:55:25] I always say, hey, I do what I can do. If I got to blown out knee, you know what I'm going to do?
[00:55:28] One that gets crossed the other leg of my new pull-ups was at your attitude. It was like, okay,
[00:55:32] what's the end I do? You know, that's how I found CrossFit was through getting shot. That's what I
[00:55:40] used to, and you know, I could care less people get very excited about the term CrossFit function
[00:55:45] training, whatever you want to call it. To me, it was really new at that time. Like I was on the body
[00:55:49] builder routine. You know, Chester's rise and back and by the 90s team guy, totally.
[00:55:53] Yeah, or otherwise known as the echo routine. Are you run on Wednesdays? But yeah, so like,
[00:55:59] and I had never done squats before. So I literally held onto a pole and lowered myself down
[00:56:04] into a squat and I picked myself up. And I just, I just changed stuff. So I could do it. And I remember
[00:56:12] the first night of sleep that I had that was really good in my wife could probably point to it
[00:56:17] on a calendar because I came back from the gym. Like I had no responsibilities at work because
[00:56:21] my squatter was still deployed. So I mean, I literally was like, hey, coming on Thursdays and
[00:56:26] we'll give you some east up on your leg. That was that was the therapy. So I went into the gym and
[00:56:32] I just crushed myself, came home, I covered in sweat and just passed out, slept good and just
[00:56:38] continued that routine on. And you know, they were saying it would take me a couple of years
[00:56:44] if ever to get back on full-acting duty because they didn't know. I mean, because it was with
[00:56:48] nerves, they're like, yeah, you reach the end of the medical practice. And you start talking about
[00:56:52] nerves. I never had, I mean, the doctors with probably a decade of medical experience is saying to me,
[00:56:57] I don't know. I'm like, hey, doc, I don't have an MD and I could tell you that I don't know. Could I
[00:57:01] get a better answer out of you than that? Like, come on, man. But yeah, I mean, I worked my self-backed.
[00:57:07] I wasn't done. I didn't want to be done. And I worked my self-back to a point where I felt
[00:57:14] confident again that I could deploy and I was still continuing. So I left and went to
[00:57:18] Buds in 2006 as an instructor. Use that time to rehab myself. And then by the time I got to Team
[00:57:25] 3, it was about four or five years after that injury where I was going through training when
[00:57:31] you were the LIC to trade it. And also, you became an officer at that point when you were going
[00:57:35] to Buds. I did. I did. I didn't have a, it's not that I didn't have a choice. It was the best
[00:57:40] choice that I had at that time. So when I got shot, I was on my LPO tour. And for people who don't
[00:57:47] understand the military, it is a mandatory go, no go, wicked for advancement. And they counted it
[00:57:55] as me not successfully completing it. So to advance, so I was an E6 at the time. And I was trying
[00:58:02] to walk the list. Sorry for laughing. Yes. You're going to be that I'm going to evil bastard because
[00:58:05] I'm laughing. I'm not laughing. You're going to laughing at the old. It's just a ridiculous stuff.
[00:58:09] This is the stuff. So if you want to march your way from E1 to E9, you have to hit these mandatory
[00:58:14] career wickets. And the jump between E6 to E7 for the enlisting guys is the large jump from
[00:58:18] middle management to the sea suite of the enlisted realm. They judge you only by your service record.
[00:58:25] Unless you have these mandatory wickets, you're getting swept off the table. And so I submitted
[00:58:30] my chief package twice with a good, awesome evaluations. I mean, I was doing some awesome stuff in
[00:58:39] my career. I had good awards, good recommendations, good eve, awesome, everybody. And two years
[00:58:45] in a row, they're like, nope. And so finally I started calling people who probably shouldn't have told
[00:58:49] me the answer, I'm like, hey, what's going on there? They're like, oh, you know, your LPO tours
[00:58:53] getting counted against you. And I didn't want to be done with being in the military. And I'm sitting
[00:59:00] there and I'm like, okay, how what can I do here if I want to continue on and I want to have
[00:59:07] impact. So I decided I needed to maneuver. So I researched officer programs in Stombo across the
[00:59:16] limited duty officer program, which is traditionally for E7 E8s and E9s. And there had never been an
[00:59:23] E6 candidate picked up. And so I threw my package in the next year that it came up and was actually
[00:59:30] selected first out of the whole stable of people that were selected that year ahead of like five or six
[00:59:34] other chiefs who ended up getting picked up for LDO. But for me, I'm looking at I'm like, I want to stay
[00:59:40] in and I want to have an impact. This is the only way that I can do it. So that's why I submitted my
[00:59:45] officer package. It was never any burning desire of mine from like years before that. It was just
[00:59:50] that I need to do something to keep moving and that was my that was my route to do it.
[00:59:55] Did you when you were, so you get wounded, right? And obviously you could have said at that point,
[01:00:02] hey, you know what, I'm done. You know, when you look at the various reasons that a person could
[01:00:08] choose from, why you said like, you know what, I'm not done. Because friends, you know,
[01:00:13] other guys that we both know that I've talked to, they have, you know, various reasons. Some of them
[01:00:17] are straight up vengeance. Like, oh, I'm going to go back and I'm going to get after it. These
[01:00:23] people are going to pay. Some of them are like, hey, for myself, you know, kind of like what you were saying
[01:00:28] like, I feel like I, I can't do it. I'm supposed to do so. I want to prove that I can go back and do it.
[01:00:34] What was like the driving reason for you? If you had, if you had to pick one, maybe it's just all
[01:00:38] those things, which is perfectly acceptable answer to it. I mean, vengeance is certainly a part of
[01:00:42] it, right? Like, oh, I dare you. I'm the only one who gets to do that to people. You know,
[01:00:49] yeah, what a crazy, crazy thing to think like that. But you kind of do like you think you're
[01:00:53] invincible, right? So I needed to prove to myself that I could still do the job that I wanted to do.
[01:00:59] I was pissed about it. And I was at a point in my life where I was still very tied to what the job
[01:01:09] meant. I derived so much of my personality and who I was from that job, because it was all that I had
[01:01:16] focused on for the vast majority of my life at that point that I didn't, I didn't know who I would be
[01:01:23] without that. So it was a combination of all of those things that just kind of kept driving me
[01:01:29] towards going back. And there was, I mean, there was never a second hesitation. I like, I knew
[01:01:34] I was going to not stop. I just didn't know that the road, the road, which I was going to take to
[01:01:40] not stop. You know, it's weird to you as an, and I, you know, for guys that like you and I that are
[01:01:44] full on institutionalized in the military, it's almost like, when I was in, I didn't understand
[01:01:54] other options. But it wasn't like, well, I could do this. Like right now we can sit back, you know,
[01:01:59] Andy, you could have gotten out back then. You should have gone into it. It's so clear to see that now.
[01:02:03] But when you're in, you're just, no, no, well, if you can't do this, well, then there's nothing
[01:02:07] else that you actually can do. This is the only option in the world. And if we're being totally honest,
[01:02:12] a lot of that is by design. I'm sure it is. The military and especially the seal teams,
[01:02:18] what do we do to our buddies who want to get out? You know, like, I am thinking about getting out.
[01:02:22] I fuck you, Twitter, Twitter. I mean, like, where, I mean, where the, I did 20 years,
[01:02:28] one of my buddies is like, I said, hey, man, yeah, I'm, like, at the 18 year mark, I told one
[01:02:33] of my close friends, I'm like, yeah, man, I'm, I'm going to retire at 20. Been like,
[01:02:36] Twitter, Twitter, Twitter, Twitter, Twitter, Twitter. But I think about the training from day one. It's
[01:02:41] about the guy to your left and right. And then you get back from admission. You take care of the team
[01:02:45] gear first. The last thing you do is you take care of yourself. So where you are the bottom of the
[01:02:50] priority list. The bottom of the priority list. Life is the bottom of the priority list. And that
[01:02:56] has secondary and tertiary effects when it comes to understanding what you can do or options that
[01:03:01] you would have outside of the military. I'm not saying they do it by a design, but the system that we
[01:03:05] come from naturally puts on a set of blinders, which I think is essential to make us as effective
[01:03:12] as we are. You're right. I think I think it is a complete secondary effect. It's not like there's some
[01:03:16] evil training person in the sky that's going, okay, the way we can get these guys to stay in.
[01:03:21] It's due to snow. The way that the seal team says evolved to be the best we can be in combat
[01:03:26] is to make this thing your number one priority, which I say that all the time, I got asked this
[01:03:30] the other day I was doing a working with a company and some guys asked me, how did you do your
[01:03:36] work life balance when you're in the seal teams? And I'm like, this isn't a answer. I shouldn't be
[01:03:40] giving. I'm not authorized. The only, you know what you do, you marry an awesome girl. And then you
[01:03:45] focus on your job. That's what I did. I married an awesome girl and I focused on my job. And my wife
[01:03:50] knew she knew. It wasn't like I covered up and said, no, no, babe, you're my number one priority. It was like,
[01:03:55] no, no, no, no, the teams. And then the teams and then the teams, then everything, then like
[01:04:02] you do and then everything else and then you're you're down here. That's the way it is and I'm not
[01:04:05] trying to be an asshole. That's the reality of the situation. And that's why, yeah, that's why
[01:04:13] another reason why when guys get wounded and they go, yeah, well, what else are you going to do?
[01:04:18] Yeah. So you get to team three. So what was your position when you? Because so by the way,
[01:04:27] so just so people understand this LDO thing, which by the way, I don't know if you know this, but it's
[01:04:31] completely gone. It's the other show to down. They shut it down. Yeah. It's one of the, if not the only
[01:04:36] way to get commissioned without a college degree. Right. I'm working on a high school diploma
[01:04:40] people public school education, barely Santa Cruz. It, but you showed up and like to this day right
[01:04:48] at this moment in time and I was quote unquote running the training, I have no idea what your job
[01:04:54] actually was. How awesome is that? That is pretty awesome. Well done. But you know, I know I could
[01:04:59] tell you exactly what rolled you for filled, you know, as a leader, but I don't know where you would
[01:05:04] have broken out on an orc chart. Well, you're actually a general officer for a task unit for the
[01:05:08] Seal team three in general. I was you were running an orc machine gun during work up because
[01:05:15] they would have failed their ORE. Okay. I mean the platoons would count or like, you know,
[01:05:22] the SEA would be like, hey, we failed in warfare where you come out to Nalum with us for the ORE.
[01:05:28] Isn't absolutely all come out in swing blanks. I mean, for one like I have, I have, I never
[01:05:37] wanted a desktop. I loved best job in the Seal teams and you know this is an E5 shooter. Absolutely.
[01:05:43] What I my first combat deployment, my responsibility was a sledgehammer and I moved up to Huli
[01:05:48] and then I moved to a shotgun and then I could do whatever I wanted to do and it was the best job in
[01:05:52] the world in like that's all I wanted to do. So although I was an officer, you get to be, by the way,
[01:05:58] you get to be a master with us like so or a master with a Huligan to it. You just become,
[01:06:06] it's your life, precise, efficient. And so the, you know, like I put my officer package in,
[01:06:12] but let's say like 20% of me was like, you know what, this is just a means to it and I'm going to
[01:06:17] figure out a way to get back on the battlefield because LDOs are not supposed to be tactical leaders
[01:06:22] at all. You're a line officer, but I should have never been, well, I should have never been by the
[01:06:28] letter of the law of the LDO manual in a tactical leadership position, which I eventually worked
[01:06:34] on my way to not by any kind of design. But I went to team three, it's a trading el, and, you know,
[01:06:42] they're getting ready to send people to Afghanistan and no one's ever said foot there. And, you know,
[01:06:48] this, the skipper wanted to send me there and then the troop commander had a great relationship with
[01:06:55] and they were short and officer here and there so I'd like, oh, maybe I'll just go out to sink
[01:06:59] my island for a little bit. No, maybe I'll get on the roof and throw some grenades in the window. It's hard
[01:07:03] to say what I'm going to do. And so I just kind of started going out there again and then like,
[01:07:08] when I went out to Nylon, when they won the troop failed their land warfri, when I went out with them
[01:07:12] and tried just to try to go and do smart stuff, they got them out to release some, give the leadership
[01:07:16] some distance space. Yeah, and it was awesome. I mean, it's awesome when guys that were experienced
[01:07:20] would come through like yourself, you're just so good to have guys like you coming through, especially
[01:07:25] because you were super experienced, really good tactically and super humble. It wasn't like you
[01:07:30] were out there like, no, you were like, oh, this is awesome training. Oh, yeah, this, hey, we need to do this.
[01:07:35] It was just, it was just so good for the troop to see that type of leadership out there.
[01:07:39] Plus, I like offensive maneuvers. And what I'm telling guys to move forward, they're like,
[01:07:44] oh, we can do that. Oh, yeah. Oh, yes. Oh, yes. We can do that. And you should. And then just,
[01:07:50] they weren't because that, you know, you get a junior officer in a community full of eight types and most
[01:07:56] of the people that work for them have more experience than them. There has to be a call because
[01:08:02] they, we eat our own because they're the most voracious community ever. So they're afraid to make
[01:08:08] an offensive call when they should make an offensive call. Like, ever, I've heard you say before,
[01:08:11] and I know we have the same position, like the default move should be aggressive, drive forward,
[01:08:16] not away. Like, put your enemy on their heels. You don't need to be on your heels at all.
[01:08:20] Like, take their space in time away to make a decision, shorten their, shorten your
[01:08:24] root aloup and get in the middle of their, and just start wreaking havoc. But you got to have, again,
[01:08:29] time in the saddle to be comfortable making those calls. And a lot of it, I noticed was pattern
[01:08:34] recognition. Like, oh, I've seen this. Okay. Hi, grounds over there. Sure, let's get some guys over there.
[01:08:38] Hey, they're going to come around this building. Don't ask, don't, don't ask me not just kill
[01:08:42] or just set the security. Just go over there. Please, like, you can see it's pattern recognition
[01:08:46] from time in the saddle. And because I was exposed, awesome people throughout my career. And I
[01:08:50] watched them. And I wrote down what they did. And I just have always tried to be a sponge. You
[01:08:55] have to be a sponge and suck up knowledge. And so then you, you do another deployment. And you do
[01:09:01] end up in a leadership position. Yeah. Which again, good job. You said it was, which did you say was
[01:09:06] unintended or something like that? It was relatively unintended. Relatively. I like, okay,
[01:09:10] you've quantified it now, baby, because I was going to have to call bullshit on you. You know,
[01:09:16] uh, so I went through the last, you know, the troop commander from that troop was like, hey,
[01:09:21] we're, you're going to come over. I was supposed to be the opso on that deployment at a firebase
[01:09:26] that was in between the two platoons. One of the officers was having a kid. He wanted to stay back
[01:09:32] for about the first month, month and a half. And so they had no A, O, I see. I'm a minted
[01:09:37] O, one at this point, freshy butter bar. One of my favorite things to do, totally in the side
[01:09:42] was to put my candies on with my butter bars and I'd go to the op smetings over at group.
[01:09:46] Yeah. And I would let like E6 as an E7, so like talked to me a little bit. I was, I mean,
[01:09:51] I look relatively young and they're like, you know, later on. Once you got some time. And these
[01:09:57] these guys are actually guys that you would probably, or in many cases, had been in the teams longer
[01:10:02] than. Oh, for sure. Yeah. 100% and I'd be like, oh, tell me more. And like, and then I'd catch
[01:10:07] them later on in my cookies and they're like, oh, I got it. I had some fun as a butter bar as well.
[01:10:12] I got it. I mean, I just like, oh, that's awesome. Thank you so much for the guy. And so I
[01:10:17] hope one day I know as much as you do. And I just like, yeah, I told, I told the, I told the chief
[01:10:23] a senior chief actually that was kind of calling me out like butter bar and at when I was at
[01:10:28] team two. And I was telling him in front of my platoons there and they all, they all knew me. And I
[01:10:33] go, well, you know, you know, senior, you got to understand, and since run the Navy, and he, he is,
[01:10:40] he went the thick ways. You can see him turning red instantaneously into orbit. Yeah,
[01:10:44] instantaneously into orbit. He actually said, you know, you guys need to straighten this
[01:10:47] into now. And I said, hey, why don't you do it? I'll meet you out the milvans. Let's call it new.
[01:10:51] And I'll be out there warming up. You'll be had the buyers. So, oh, that was so good.
[01:10:58] Yeah. So, you know, the, the true commander was like, hey, do the last month, the training with
[01:11:02] which was the San Commandy block. So, went out there with the San Commandy block. The
[01:11:07] skipper was like, hey, go over there as the opso, but we're going to slide you out with this
[01:11:10] platoon. We're having some potential leadership issues with the OIC.
[01:11:16] Yeah. And man that I know you're familiar with. Because we experienced them largely together.
[01:11:23] And I think I think, and this is me speaking for why I think he did that I think he did me.
[01:11:28] He put me out there as a, as a safety mechanism. I don't know. I don't think he had anything else
[01:11:34] to do. So, I went out there and he ended up being relieved and then the skipper. I mean,
[01:11:42] I was an O1 wearing O3 and O4 when Scott wasn't paying attention because I would just take his
[01:11:48] color devices off and without whatever. Something like I'm going to know three either. So, I would
[01:11:51] just put on whatever color device. I could get my hands on. And good thing there's no kernel bars available.
[01:11:57] I didn't wear it. I could find some general stores that had been rocking those things. And
[01:12:02] I mean, it was one of the best deployments of all the stuff that I did while I was in.
[01:12:09] I think what I was the proudest of is a lot of the guys I deployed with for people that I had put
[01:12:13] through, but to see them overseas on their first deployment. And the only word for it is
[01:12:21] is afraid to do something because of the consequences. You know, there's, as you know, there's a lot
[01:12:26] of oversight. If you pull the trigger on somebody, you had better be able to articulate why you did that.
[01:12:33] You need to be able to conduct yourself over the radio. You have to be able to paint the picture.
[01:12:36] There's a correct way to brief. There's the ways that you got to play, you know,
[01:12:41] mental judo, you know, and interacting with people and to see these young guys who had no experience
[01:12:49] and afraid to, afraid to not probably the best word, but has it tended to make decisions. And then
[01:12:56] at the end of the deployment, just sharp teeth out, knowing what they need to do and I can just sit back.
[01:13:04] And it's not, and again, that that's a lot of that is them getting that experience. But I was just
[01:13:08] glad that I was able to be there to provide that buffer because I wasn't going to let anything happen.
[01:13:14] Well, I was out there to the best of my ability. Like, I always picked the most dangerous place to be.
[01:13:19] I always wanted to be in the position where there's going to be a decision to be made.
[01:13:23] Like, that's just the way that I want to be. Like, where's the most dangerous place to be?
[01:13:27] Where's the most optimal place to be? Put me in coach. I'm going to be right here.
[01:13:31] And then to try to teach other people to do that exact same thing and then to step back,
[01:13:36] that to me is probably what I'm the most proud of as the growth of the people that I was there with.
[01:13:41] You know, that you talk about that mental judo thing, which, again, this is one that's going to be hard
[01:13:46] for civilians to understand how much, you know, it's like a bureaucratic force that exists in
[01:13:53] the military and really you have to be, you have to be able to to navigate through that.
[01:14:03] And that was, that was the thing for me that I always look back and I go, I wish I would have
[01:14:09] done a better job of teaching that to guys because I had no problem teaching them the tactical side of
[01:14:14] things. And then if I really was close with someone or I really spent some time with them,
[01:14:18] I'd be able to get through the rest of it and say, like, okay, by the way, this is how you have to
[01:14:21] do this. This is how you have to walk this line. This is what you have to say in these situations
[01:14:25] and they'd be great. But some guys would catch like, some guys would catch the the surface
[01:14:32] jocco, right? Just like the surface jocco, which is like, kero, right? Which is, which is awesome,
[01:14:38] right? That's absolutely part of part of it, right? But guys that only caught the surface jocco,
[01:14:44] sometimes they get caught up later because they'd say, you know, all this guy was a, this guy was
[01:14:49] you know, a risk of earth. Like, well, you know, with years which got to do and you got to
[01:14:52] get on the risk of earth. So this guy's knee going over the years, which got to do and he's got to handle them. So
[01:14:56] that's something that when I had the opportunity at the time, but that thing, the other thing about it
[01:15:01] is there's no there's no training for that. That's just, you know, it's just going to bring us
[01:15:07] at all. Like, that is, there is no one that says, and it's hard even simulate because that means
[01:15:12] you got to stimulate some other human beings, rank and characteristics and personality. That might
[01:15:16] change half way through your deployment. That might change halfway through your briefing.
[01:15:19] You know, you can brief a guy that's all in a good mood and all of a sudden he turns because
[01:15:23] he solves you said something that you've got to learn how to deal with that and that political
[01:15:27] side of that's what it is. Basically, it's political and its relationships building those things up.
[01:15:31] That is so key. And once you get into the leadership position, I hate to say this. I hate to say
[01:15:39] once you're in the leadership position, that is at least as important as what you're going to do
[01:15:46] tactically. I mean, the seal teams have made their mark, kinetically, but we get our go-no-go off of
[01:15:54] power point. Absolutely. I mean, I've had briefs come back because the helicopter was facing the wrong
[01:16:01] way on the insertion slide. I've almost gotten the fist fights. I'm like, listen, it's hell
[01:16:07] vettica 12. Not 11. We're not doing times new Roman shit now. All right. You bad new bad
[01:16:14] house. Get out of my face with that time's new Roman son. The battle space commander said it's
[01:16:18] hell vettica. Bold sometimes only on the ex-field slide. But like, I mean, it's insane. Like we have,
[01:16:24] we can bring some of the most amazing combat power to bear, but only if the leadership can articulate
[01:16:31] and navigate what the battle space owner wants. Because we don't make sense to a lot of people
[01:16:37] who don't come from our background and you've got to learn to read what they're saying and speak
[01:16:41] their language and then you just get them a newver. I mean, that's the biggest thing is you got
[01:16:46] a maneuver and then then you can be so wildly effective. It doesn't matter how good you are,
[01:16:50] tactically. If you can't get outside of the wire, I mean, and it's truly if that tells people
[01:16:55] this all the time, you want to shut down the seal teams, kill Microsoft Office. We're done.
[01:17:02] We're done. Yeah, the whole military is actually very, you know. It is a bureaucracy. You said it's
[01:17:08] kind of a bureaucracy. It is the biggest, I mean, it's 100% bureaucratic. I mean, it's amazing.
[01:17:14] And as an E5, you're like, I just want to go jam my mags up and then make them empty. And
[01:17:19] you're like, yeah, that's awesome. I'm going to be up for 12 hours looking for the appropriate
[01:17:23] helicopter icon. And I may get sassy and have it move in with helicopter noise. It depends.
[01:17:29] Yeah. And then you got to be able to brief it, right? Because then there's a whole other skill. Like,
[01:17:33] I don't know how many times you have to go and not only present the brief that like talked to the
[01:17:37] guy who's going to say yes or no and develop that relationship. Yeah. You're selling your operation.
[01:17:42] Many are pretty selling your operation. Until you get that relationship, we're there coming to
[01:17:46] you and saying this is a, which is the best possible case. And I was blessed to end up in that situation
[01:17:52] where it was just a total mind-melde of, hey, whatever you guys want to do, what can you do here?
[01:17:58] Can you, that's, that's when you, that's when you just are loving life and it doesn't get any better than that.
[01:18:04] Good times with power point. Oh my god. So you got, you get to control key in the arrow. It only
[01:18:10] moves a little bit. Yeah, if you're need to move that icon, just to get it centered. I know
[01:18:17] so much about power point that I could never forget if I wanted to. So horrible. You, so that was
[01:18:23] it. That was an awesome deployment though. It was awesome for different reasons. I mean, don't
[01:18:27] give me wrong. I was as an O1. I was carrying generally my 300 one back and two travel
[01:18:32] missiles to high ground positions and coming back with them all empty. The majority of the time.
[01:18:37] So I got to have a, so yes, that does go in the awesome deployment box. Yeah. So I got to have a
[01:18:41] little bit of what we'll call a hoot. And then, but again, professionally developing for me too,
[01:18:47] because I didn't have any experience being an OPSO for a task unit. And you want to talk about
[01:18:52] relationships stuff, the sometimes, you know, the base that we were on, I just developed a relationship
[01:18:56] with their entry or S3. And in and up, I was selling myself. We had a great relationship. I could
[01:19:02] come to him the day before, but like, hey, we're looking to do a naces like yep, no problem. Let me
[01:19:05] know, it's line up a cure. And it just, it's so much pulling the trigger easy. All the stuff you
[01:19:12] got to do to get to that point is so hard. And it just doesn't make the movies because it's boring.
[01:19:17] Yeah, no, there's there will literally never be a movie or a book about that crap. Why can't
[01:19:23] have a movie about a 72 hour planning cycle? No, or sin. Where's this 3 meter imagery? God damn it,
[01:19:28] this is five. I heard one of my puttune commanders, not late. The other dead Delta puttune commander was
[01:19:33] telling someone. And he goes, you know, someone was like, oh, yeah, you guys got to me. And he said,
[01:19:38] jaw, I watched Jocco literally beat his head up against the wall for every single operation that we
[01:19:43] did. I was like, don't damn. And that wasn't the conventional side. Yeah, I was beaten up against.
[01:19:51] There was, you know, there's our chain of command, which is very, which can be very micro focused on
[01:19:57] little things from time to time occasionally. You get the broad spectrum of leadership inside of the
[01:20:03] teams, not all of it is good. But you, whichever, whichever game you got to play, that's what you
[01:20:08] got to play. And that's exactly what I did. And that's, you know, that's why I always say that
[01:20:12] had the same relationship with every ball set I'd ever have. Yeah, no matter who they were,
[01:20:16] what, how crazy they were, or how awesome they were. They trusted me. And they're going to
[01:20:20] give me what I needed to do my job. Yep. So that was your last deployment then. It was.
[01:20:24] And then you went to trade at trade at and I was gone. Uh, did you get there? Check. I got there
[01:20:30] in August of 2010. Yep. I was, well, I, I think the last time I literally saw you before today was in
[01:20:36] the hallway right by your old office. You were walking out and I was coming back from deployment. We
[01:20:40] like, I was up there. Yeah, later. Yeah. So like five years ago, that's not what you do.
[01:20:45] Actually seven years ago. What did you do that? Was the opposite? Okay. I think, I mean,
[01:20:49] did you get to go out at all? I didn't do anything. I augmented the leap frogs. Um,
[01:20:54] I'm not, I don't do good when I come. I mean, I did my job, but like, I'm not a paperwork,
[01:21:01] you know, ninja and all. And nor is there really, it's not really an opso much like the
[01:21:07] reddit guy is not the CEO. He's the OIC. So a lot of those positions. There's redundancy.
[01:21:12] There was a training warrant. Yeah. You know, it like there was, also it's fairly repetitive. So
[01:21:17] there's not like I'm at a team with the first time you're going to go through this and out to
[01:21:20] everything. You get through two or three cycles and it's like, okay, you could put this thing on autopilot.
[01:21:24] It's the same thing every three, six months, whatever it is. So I got medically retired. I was going to
[01:21:31] just get out of the military. I came back from that deployment and I was talking to the officer
[01:21:37] detailer about what I would need to do to continue my career. And she said, well, you know,
[01:21:43] since you haven't done your AOC or your OIC tour, we're going to need you to do is to back the back
[01:21:48] of the AOC OIC. Then you're going to do your, you know, your disassociated tour. I'm like,
[01:21:53] we can stop right now. Like my wife's not going to tolerate that. Like I think she's at the
[01:21:58] vast limit. I was at the limit. My body, like my ankle, I almost had to medit back my self out a
[01:22:03] couple of times, like roll my ankle extremely bad on an offset patrol in, like laying on
[01:22:10] target with my foot up in the air. It was just, I was, I recognized it like my time was over.
[01:22:15] So I researched what it would take for me to stay in and continue and it was not tentable. So
[01:22:20] I was just going to get out of the military and I was five days from my separation date and went
[01:22:25] to go get my physical and the doc is like, no, I'm not signing this right on. Good for him.
[01:22:31] They extended me a year. I mean, I had to go. I went out to the night go out and Bethesda did that
[01:22:37] as far as the kind of the horse power for the ride up. Got the whole full assessment done and
[01:22:41] up getting medically retired, which was a huge benefit to myself. All thanks to that doc who was like,
[01:22:46] no, I'm not, I'm not going to sign this. So yeah, that is awesome. And there's plenty of team
[01:22:51] guys that, you know, spend their entire career. I'm not going to the doctor. I'm not going to
[01:22:56] do that. And that's another thing that gets conditioned into you going through basic seal training,
[01:22:59] which is don't go to medical no matter what. I was in the same way. Even after getting shot,
[01:23:02] my medical record was thin. And you know, I was going through the questionnaire and the interview
[01:23:07] at the actual discharge physical and he's like, what? Like you couldn't find any of the documentation.
[01:23:12] And then I left Nike with like 300 pages. And if you read that thing, it's like this guy will never,
[01:23:17] I should be in a wheelchair right now with a straw. Like you read that thing. I'm like, oh my gosh.
[01:23:23] And then you know, get away. It's like the bureaucracy submitted a package to the Med Board in six
[01:23:28] months later. They're like, okay, you're out. And that was it. That was it. No retirement ceremony.
[01:23:33] I just was like, hey, I went and talked to the OSC. I was like, hey, it's almost lunch time.
[01:23:40] I'm going to leave now. And I'm never going to come back. How many years was that for you?
[01:23:46] One month shot had 17. Yeah. And so I literally went in. I was like, hey, it's almost lunch.
[01:23:50] I'm leaving. I'm not going to come back. And it's like, all right, cool. See you later.
[01:23:54] I had some terminal leave saved up at like 90 days. Where have I just gone? Never went back in.
[01:23:58] I think I went and got my DD2 14 or like my retirement ID card like a year later.
[01:24:03] Yeah. Just never went back. That's crazy. Yeah. It's crazy. How you do that time?
[01:24:09] And then it's over like that. In a blink of an eye. I remember that. I was all big.
[01:24:14] The retirement ceremony did that. Came back. All my rest of my gear, which was all packed up in my
[01:24:20] drawing cage went up, grabbed it, pulled them back through it in the back of my van,
[01:24:23] grabbed out the gate. That was it. Yep. No more. Yeah. I just gone. That's it. Done. Never do.
[01:24:28] Never to be back. 20 years done. Yep. It's bizarre. So then you get into the afterlife. Indeed.
[01:24:38] Yeah. And what's that been? Like so what year did you, what year was that? That you retired.
[01:24:42] I got retired the last day of June 2013. Okay. So I'm coming up on this year. Before years.
[01:24:48] Uh, I had fortunately I was kind of double dipping on weekends. I had a job that I was doing on the
[01:24:54] weekend. So I transitioned to doing that full time. And I dabbled in a lot of stuff. I mean, I got
[01:25:00] the 3500 hours of flight time. I've typed rated in a Gulf Stream jet, a citation 525 jet,
[01:25:06] which gives me like five other jets. I could fly. I did. When did you rack up all those hours?
[01:25:12] What I do on my weekends is not. No. The business of the Navy. No.
[01:25:17] I flew hard. I mean, I was just flying a ton. I got my pilot's license on my own when I was in.
[01:25:23] And then all the rest of the licenses came in the two to three years after after I was in.
[01:25:28] But I was just was cranking out hours. I had a company that I was working for that was paying for
[01:25:32] all the training. So I could fly as much as I wanted to. So I dove into the bucket, both feet.
[01:25:38] I did charter flying for a bit. I mean, I was managing licensing and sponsorship deals for an organization.
[01:25:44] And it just everything kind of just morphed. I left that organization.
[01:25:50] Got back into teaching military guys a little bit on the jump side of the house.
[01:25:54] I've been passionate about jumping ever since the first jump that I did.
[01:25:57] How many jumps do you ever know? Just over 6,000.
[01:26:00] Which seems like a lot. Yeah. The tilley guys that have 29,000. Yeah.
[01:26:04] I jumped at Scott F. San Diego all the time. And if you work in the sport for any period of time,
[01:26:08] you'll be at 10, 15, 20,000. It's not, it's not uncommon. But in the military,
[01:26:13] it's just, that's the school bus to get to work. So it's an ancillary skill set at best. So I couldn't
[01:26:17] pursue it until I got out. But when I got, it was hard for me. When I got out, if I'm being honest,
[01:26:25] I got to a point where I couldn't watch the news anymore. You know, 2013,
[01:26:29] all the ground in Iraq that was sweat and blood and tears. If people that we know to gain
[01:26:36] was being eroded. And I described it like watching the tide go out and inch it at time until all
[01:26:41] the sudden it's gone. And I used to make the news. And now I'm sitting here on the couch watching it.
[01:26:45] And I had to turn it off and I really struggled with finding something that I thought mattered.
[01:26:51] And it's, it was tough for me. I didn't think a lot about what I was going to do when I was out
[01:26:55] when I was in for reasons that we kind of already talked about. It's a natural path that you take when
[01:27:00] you're in. But it took me like a year and a half to really get my head on straight and figure out
[01:27:06] what it is that I want to do. I still don't even know how I'm going to do it. But I know that I want
[01:27:12] to make a difference. I want to do, I want to make this country a better place than it is right now.
[01:27:18] I want to take the awesome stuff that I was exposed to when I was in the teams,
[01:27:22] from the people that I was fortunate to be surrounded by and make people better with that information.
[01:27:28] How I'm going to do that? I don't know. But that's kind of the circular path that I'm on,
[01:27:32] like half of my year. The other half I just dress up in a squirrel suit and jump out of
[01:27:37] my airplanes and off of cliffs. What is nice? It doesn't suck. I'm not going to do it forever,
[01:27:44] though. I mean, I look at it as something that's enriching for me and empowering for me. But
[01:27:50] there's a timeline for how long I could do it. I mean, I'm a bad landing away from not being able
[01:27:55] to jump anymore. And I take it very seriously. I have a very structured training protocol. I don't
[01:28:00] let myself get out of currency, whether it be jumping or packing parachutes or,
[01:28:04] I mean, I treat it like a military operation. It doesn't make it safer for me. But I try to pay
[01:28:09] attention more than anybody else who is around me and my goal is to never be surprised. Like,
[01:28:14] I don't ever, I want to understand what's coming and I don't like, and it happens occasionally.
[01:28:19] You'll jump off of a cliff or you're jumping out of an airplane or something will happen that
[01:28:24] surprises you and I try to avoid that at all costs. Because I find that that's when the
[01:28:28] catastrophic stuff can occur. But it's, uh, you got to find the next step. I mean, you and I both know
[01:28:34] people who derive their entire identity from what they used to do and it's tough to sit back and
[01:28:42] watch them not be able to depart from that because it becomes, it's self destructive.
[01:28:48] Yeah, because it doesn't last forever. It can't last forever. I mean, you're renting your
[01:28:52] trident. It's not yours. You're at best. You can move the marker in the seal teams, hopefully in the
[01:28:59] right direction. Maybe leave a little bit of legacy if you did, you know, the legacy that you should
[01:29:04] leave is making it better than when you got there. But that's the best you can do and then you
[01:29:09] got to put it away. Even if you do 20 years with the average lifespan of an American, you got some
[01:29:15] time left and the military retirement check. It's not massive. So you're going to need another J.O.B.
[01:29:23] But what I needed, I needed a purpose. And that's where I started doing, you know, fundraising for the
[01:29:27] seal foundation. That to me was huge teaching the military guys, which kind of felt like I had
[01:29:34] not a foot in the fight, but I had some impact again and just trying to shorten their learning curve.
[01:29:39] Because they expect these guys to know so much stuff. Yeah. But if you could just shorten their learning
[01:29:43] curve and give them a little bit of space to breathe, you know, to take the stress off.
[01:29:47] And that's stuff's real. Yeah. Like that stuff is real. And when you when you impart that knowledge
[01:29:52] on young guys, it is real. When you make that learning curve shorter and steeper and faster,
[01:29:57] that is real. That has a real impact on those kids that go out there. And it's those little
[01:30:03] lessons that they learned. I mean, I still hear that from guys that come back and they said,
[01:30:07] yep. Yeah. We did this. You know, cover move. You know, I'm like, yes, like I'm so happy to hear that.
[01:30:14] Because I know it's kind of like the early days of J.O. in the fact that we didn't really in the
[01:30:20] early days of J.J.O. that there wasn't as much knowledge as there is now. And now the first three days
[01:30:28] you go to J.J.O. you're going to learn about underhooks, you're going to learn about body position,
[01:30:32] you're going to learn about hip movement. I didn't learn no one taught me that stuff. Back back
[01:30:37] the day. No one taught you that stuff. You just had to figure it out. And if somebody teaches it to you,
[01:30:43] it's like you take a quantum leap. Yeah. And it's the same thing with the guys that are in the military.
[01:30:49] And they can get that quantum leap just by saying, oh, here's a perspective of leadership that
[01:30:54] it took me, Jack asked Jaco, you know, 14 years and screwing up a bunch of things to go, oh,
[01:31:00] this is what you need to do in these situations. So to be able to say, look, you don't need to be
[01:31:04] the jackass that I was. All you need to do is know this little bit tidbit right here in this whole
[01:31:08] thing over here. Yeah. And that definitely has a huge impact on those guys. And it's it is awesome to
[01:31:12] feel that. Yeah. And it makes them better to learn in the other stuff because they're less stressed out.
[01:31:16] They have a better understanding. And it's just, and at the 90% of the stuff I teach them, like listen,
[01:31:22] it's pattern recognition. I saw this so many times that I did this and it defeated that. So just
[01:31:26] do this. Just trust me and do this. And you'll be better. And then they do and they're like, oh, wow,
[01:31:31] that was awesome. Like, yeah, I know. That's what I told you. How about the, uh, you
[01:31:37] talk about the foundation? Yeah. What are you doing to found tell us a little bit about the
[01:31:40] foundation and how if people want to support the foundation, what's the best way to get that done?
[01:31:44] Yeah. Uh, so obviously, there, I think they're, I think they're last at I heard there's 40,000
[01:31:49] service-based organizations that help people prefer for real to the military. So there's a variety of choices.
[01:31:55] And if you're from an army family, awesome, go support an army charity, right? I obviously have a
[01:32:00] close DNA tie to seals. So, uh, a buddy of mine recommended, uh, trying some stuff skydiving.
[01:32:11] And the skydiving world to try to drive attention to fundraise for the seal foundation. Because just
[01:32:17] like, I've never had, I think, a unique thought in my entire life. I swear that every idea that
[01:32:21] we're had came from somebody else was like this one was his. But to me, that was the link to finding
[01:32:26] a purpose again because I realized that, okay, my, my day is putting my toes on the line or over,
[01:32:32] but there will always be people with their toes on the line. And the next best step is, let's
[01:32:36] create a buffer for the families to step in. Because I mean, you've seen it, it's a, I, the knock on the door
[01:32:43] is a tornado wrapped inside of a tsunami with a hurricane at the same time. And it is destructive.
[01:32:49] So let's try to do something that helps the families, uh, and that's what the seal foundation does.
[01:32:54] Everything from educational support to legacy preservation, uh, and everything in between. I mean,
[01:33:00] you can go, the Navy seal foundation has an awesome website. And there's people who do go fun
[01:33:06] me is, which is what I did or go to the foundation and donate directly because I mean,
[01:33:10] that there, you can look at their rating as well, too. It's like 96 cents at every book goes to
[01:33:15] what they espouse it's going to go to. It's awesome. Like, it's a great foundation.
[01:33:19] Uh, yeah, do some research on it, get involved and skip a latte one day, you know, and donate five bucks.
[01:33:27] And it goes to, it goes to a good, it goes to a good cause. I've been into some houses where, you know,
[01:33:33] kids are getting raised by a memory of a father and a picture over a fireplace and no money will ever
[01:33:38] replace that, but it maybe will make their life a little bit easier. They're not about that. What was the,
[01:33:44] what was the record you were going after? Ah, yes, the completely arbitrary distance,
[01:33:49] lateral measurement of distance in a wing suit. So I, that was the idea where all the good ideas
[01:33:57] start, which was in the bar over cocktail. You know, buddy, it was like, hey, man, you should go
[01:34:01] try to set a world record in your wing suit. I'm like, well, I don't even own one yet. So what are you
[01:34:05] talking about? I'll do it, of course, but like, what's the record? I mean, I've been to what is it?
[01:34:09] Yeah, what? I was like, I mean, yeah, obviously crush it. But what is it exactly again? And where do I get one of those?
[01:34:16] And it was trying to set the, for this distance, are far this distance, sorry. The far this distance
[01:34:23] flown in a wing suit. So I bought a wing suit and after jumping it for less than a year, which I don't
[01:34:32] recommend to anybody to do this ever. I got hooked up with a really good mentor to the guy who
[01:34:37] actually taught me how to pay his job. taught me how to fly the suit and we went up to Davis,
[01:34:42] California and I jumped out of a caravan at 36,500 feet, got into a lovely spin, which I didn't
[01:34:49] ever happen before. So that was a great experience of his new for everybody. And got out of it and
[01:34:54] then just flew the suit as far as I could and ended up breaking two world records one for the
[01:34:59] distance that you fly before opening your parachute. And then the second one is they tacked on the
[01:35:03] distance from when you open your parachute to when you touch the ground. So you keep flying forward.
[01:35:08] Yeah, and I had an on-heading opening. So it just opened up in that direction and I was exhausted.
[01:35:12] So I just laid there like a limp piece of meat and augured into the ground into a farmer's field,
[01:35:18] because I had no, I had like my landing zone was earth. I couldn't see the airport that I was,
[01:35:24] I had some visual indicators. Or was it like that, farwards? 18.25 miles. So I got out of this bird
[01:35:31] and I passed. Did you really get into a spin when you came out? Oh yeah. What happened? Just nowhere?
[01:35:36] I'm just not really good at an ointment. And I didn't have the requisite skill or confidence to be
[01:35:41] attempting what I was attempting. But it was a challenge starting front of me and I was like,
[01:35:46] of course I'm going to do this. I had, I literally had not been jumping wing suits. I did
[01:35:50] that jump in August. I got my first wing suit in December of the year prior. It's not a, not recommended
[01:35:57] for people. So I got in the spin and I got out of it, but I got out of the plane. I, I knew where the
[01:36:02] airport was and I knew I was going to fly in that direction. But I passed the airport at over 10,000 feet
[01:36:08] in the air and then I was just looking at fields and data. So I just put my head down and was flying.
[01:36:13] I didn't have an elevator on me. It was awesome. There was so many things that were just,
[01:36:16] I was eyeballing it, calibrated before I went. I was like camera one, camera two, camera one.
[01:36:21] All right. But I just come back from the base jumping trip to Europe.
[01:36:25] I think goodness I had because I'm flying. I'm like, those trees are looking really big.
[01:36:30] Oh yeah. Those, those trees are looking really big. I'm going to pull, you know,
[01:36:34] moderately low opening altitude, flew straight into the dirt and yeah, people like,
[01:36:39] oh, because it's been broken since then. A Marine did and people like, oh, you're going to go
[01:36:43] for it again. But no, never, never, never. Why? I got into the spin because the plane, the, the
[01:36:51] Sessner 206, the caravan, is not designed to be that high. Like it had a supercharged engine,
[01:36:57] a different propeller system. Everything was stripped out of there except for the huge oxygen
[01:37:01] bottle. It was just the pilot, the oxygen tech and me. And, you know, normally when you're
[01:37:06] skydiving, they'll pull back on the throttle to slow down. You know, they call it, given you a cut,
[01:37:11] a cut of the airspeed. Well, if he would have done that at that altitude, we'd have fallen out of the
[01:37:15] sky. So he's like, I just fist on the throttle with his foot on the dash, pulling back. And that
[01:37:21] opened the door and I stuck my head out. I was like, oh, no. Oh, no. I'm jumping like the biggest wingsuit
[01:37:28] on the market. And they're like their combination of a prom dress and a straight jacket. And I
[01:37:35] got out of the plane and it just inflated and, oh my god, boy, here we go. That's good times right there.
[01:37:44] Yeah, come on, atcha full speed. But you, you raised some money for the, for the foundation. Yeah,
[01:37:49] it's like 150,000 bucks for the foundation. And, you know, from that, I developed a great
[01:37:54] relationship with them. The sea hill of the foundation is married to my first troop chief that I
[01:38:00] have when I was at the East Coast. So there's a great tie in and anytime I go like I will. Yeah.
[01:38:06] But so anytime that they call me though, like my default answer is yes. Like, of course, I'll
[01:38:11] help out anything that I can do. And I mean, honestly, like, I won't say that it saved me, but it
[01:38:15] helped, it helped me back on the road that I should have been to have a purpose like that.
[01:38:20] And then, I mean, I bet you, I, I, I, I, I hypothesized that for you working with organizations and
[01:38:27] leaders and seeing the light come on, makes you, you know, I mean, it, it, it gives you a purpose and
[01:38:31] life again to have part of those lessons. It's exactly the same thing for me. So one built to the
[01:38:35] other that kind of got my feet in the, in the pool of interface and with people like that. And
[01:38:40] I realized that it makes a difference and it's important. That's awesome. Well, it's been awesome
[01:38:46] to do, uh, hang out with you. Yeah. I appreciate it. Once every seven years we should do it. Yeah,
[01:38:51] seven years will be being, and speaking of purpose, that controls, we know you have one purpose,
[01:38:58] and that is to kind of inform anybody that might want to support this podcast, you know, on how they
[01:39:05] might be able to do that. Just to clarify, oh, oh, there we go. My purpose to inform is part of a
[01:39:13] creator purpose. Okay. Okay. Understood. I'm disloosed for now. I understand. When you jumped out with the
[01:39:19] wingsuit, yeah. And you went into the spin, did you think that that was that for you? No, I never think
[01:39:25] like that. Straight out every day. I would say somebody commented, because I said the other day on,
[01:39:30] I, I forget, I don't know if we had someone on the podcast, but I was saying that,
[01:39:34] like, when I'm flying in an aircraft in a commercial airliner, I think if this thing crashes,
[01:39:40] I'm going to live. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah. I'm going to grab this chair seat and
[01:39:44] I'm going to turn it into something. I'm going to throw it in the water that's going to break the
[01:39:48] surface tension. I'm going to live. What? No, it's a question. Yeah. Okay. I mean, like, I'm not saying
[01:39:53] that it was going to work out great for me, but I'm going to die missing my fingernails because I'm
[01:39:57] clawing my way to a victory. Like, it's that the thought never enters the mind, like, okay, I need to
[01:40:02] get up now because it's over. Yeah. Not that you have that much of a choice. Yeah. But you're still
[01:40:07] fight period. Yeah. Yeah. No, it's good. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'd probably be the same way. You know,
[01:40:14] it's going to, you know, finally, anyway. Uh, let's talk about some support. What that's do it. Let's
[01:40:23] talk about on it. You know, on it. You heard it on it. I do. Yeah. Of course you have everyone has,
[01:40:27] there you go. You're good. Perhaps just check out on it. How do I need this? Okay. Right. I need it.
[01:40:33] Anyway, on it, uh, got some more real oil. So I'm good to go baseline. Um, on it is a, what do you
[01:40:43] call it? My sponsor. Supportor. Supportor. Yeah. So if you want to support, uh, this podcast and
[01:40:50] or yourself at the same time. And you're in to supplements. You work out a lot. Um, we recommend
[01:40:56] on it supplements. Take on it's supplements. It's the only one. The best one. Anyway,
[01:41:00] you're going 10% off on it.com slash.com. Let's say you get the 10% off. Anyway, yeah, let's
[01:41:08] go to an, uh, the way the last podcast. Yeah. As people noted, yeah, we had Colonel Reader on here,
[01:41:16] you know, a Vietnam veteran. And I pre-briefed Echo, I said, look, this guy's flying in. He got
[01:41:20] up at three o'clock in the morning. He's coming in here at six o'clock at night to do a three-hour
[01:41:24] podcast. He's been in a conference all day. When it comes to, you know, time to go through your
[01:41:29] stuff, go through it quickly. And people were said, hey, did you have Echo on a leash? And I said,
[01:41:34] we just pre-briefed. We're just respecting the Colonel's time. So I've get the feeling right now.
[01:41:39] We could be paying for that. Right. Yeah, metaphorically, I didn't have a leash for sure.
[01:41:44] Get out there by the next day. I'm excited. Usually, usually I tell a cool story, because it's not
[01:41:51] like, hey, take a cruel oil and then I don't take cruel oil, or I take it in and I'm like,
[01:41:55] whatever this doesn't work. It works. So during the week, I work out and I kind of talk about my
[01:42:03] experience positive or negative, but in this case, never negative, because it actually works. It's
[01:42:08] one of the only uh supplement companies that you know will work. Anyway, I'm not going to go into
[01:42:14] any stories. I only worked out a few times this week and it's all the same story. Why did you only
[01:42:19] work out a few times this week? Oh, there's um, things. Oh, you know. Okay. I worked out today.
[01:42:26] What? Okay. No, I'm just making sure it sounds like there might be some slack. No. Echo's world right now.
[01:42:31] Yeah. Yeah. Maybe maybe not. Even if I told you this story, be a redundant story.
[01:42:37] Okay. You know what I'm saying? Like my joints feel good. You know, people know that are
[01:42:42] already taking cruel oil. That's what happens. Anyway, if you like these supplements,
[01:42:48] if you don't actually, if you don't know about the supplements, get them, make your own evaluation.
[01:42:52] You know, God of listening to me anymore. Anyway, let's switch over to Amazon. Amazon click through.
[01:42:58] So how that works is if you want to support this podcast, before you do your Amazon shopping, go
[01:43:03] to jocopodcast.com. Click on the Amazon banner. Then do your shopping. Support.
[01:43:10] I made the sodium in the water analogy. You know, you know, when you, it's like, it's not just sodium.
[01:43:18] It's like potassium. It's like heavy metals. I think it's called you throw them in water. Boom.
[01:43:22] Big explosion. I make the analogy that clicking through Amazon is a small action takes what three seconds.
[01:43:28] Right? Yeah. Maybe not even. And you think, oh, yeah. I'm going to, you know, click through.
[01:43:32] And I'm going to do a shopping that doesn't because of my action. My small action doesn't.
[01:43:37] It's not a big deal. But here's the thing. That's more action is a big deal. Just like sodium in water.
[01:43:43] It's going to be the sodium. If you want to support. So click through. Do your shopping. Boom.
[01:43:48] That's a good, good way to support podcasts. Also, subscribe if you haven't already. On iTunes.
[01:43:56] Leave a review. Jocca. I'm the monster. Stitcher. Google play not everyone has an iPhone.
[01:44:02] Yeah. I always ask somebody asked about some other thing to sound cloud.
[01:44:06] Sound cloud. So I'm not 100% sure of how that works. My explored sound cloud before.
[01:44:15] Unless it's like a separate thing. It does push your podcast.
[01:44:18] Let us know how to do that. Yeah. If we're missing on sound cloud, then yeah, I'm sure that should
[01:44:25] should be where we should be as well. Anyway, subscribe. Yeah. To whatever the one that you're doing,
[01:44:31] Google Play iTunes, whichever. Subscribe if you haven't already. Leave a review. If you feel like it.

[01:45:44] That's a good way to support it. There you go. Ah, but psychological officer.
[01:45:50] If you don't know what to you know psychological orifice. Yeah. Support it.
[01:45:56] There you go. See? How can you not really? I mean, that's a rhetorical question. Yeah.
[01:46:00] You're right about that. So yeah, if you don't know, it's, you know, when you have moments of
[01:46:04] weakness, if you're what, getting up early in the morning, tired, tired, on a press, news or whatever,
[01:46:11] or you're going to, you know, you're about to work out, but you'll skip the workout because you're
[01:46:14] not feeling like it. Moments of weakness. You get this album. You can download each individual track or
[01:46:20] the whole album. Whatever, Jaco will get you through it. It's like a spot.
[01:46:26] Makes you want to do the workout. Want to wake up early. Anyway, I tune psychological warfare
[01:46:32] search psychological warfare. Jaco willing. We're actually getting some requests now for other moments
[01:46:39] of weakness. Yeah. People like, hey, this moment of weakness, we need to track this moment of
[01:46:43] weakness need to track. So like what, I'm logging those down. Someone was saying, when I get tired,
[01:46:51] oh, right. In other words, it's 10 o'clock at night. I'm getting tired. I still have work to do. Yeah.
[01:46:57] I think I'm just going to blow off the work and just go to sleep because it's easy route.
[01:47:01] Yeah. Maybe we need to track for things like that. Yeah. It's possible. And because you
[01:47:06] do the whole thing biologically when you hit the wall, right? That's your body really in a way saying,
[01:47:12] like, hey, you're you're going too far. But nowadays in our environment going too far is beneficial
[01:47:19] because you have this like other goal that your body in a way doesn't really know about.
[01:47:24] So psychological warfare will help you get past that natural body and check exactly, right?
[01:47:29] Get your mind back there. It does. Yeah. So anyway, jump on that man. That's what that's one that's
[01:47:33] supporting yourself fully. Anyway, it has been number one since the day it was released straight
[01:47:42] up. That's pretty cool. I'm not mad at that at all. You know why that is? Why? Because useful people are
[01:47:48] supporting the podcast and that's yeah, that's pretty cool. So thank you for your time.
[01:47:52] Way less people skipping workouts, way more people waking up early. Obviously.
[01:47:56] There you go. And those are the ways. Also while you're clicking through Amazon,
[01:48:02] you can pick up the books that we review on the podcast, right? We just did my

[01:48:55] when you get the tea on. Also, I've heard it called problem solver tea because the problems that you
[01:49:02] have, a little bit of tea, also in problems you're getting solved. So you can do that. And by the way,
[01:49:11] it sounds like, oh, this is, I'm just being exaggerating or whatever, factual. 147%
[01:49:18] factual. Or tea. Amazon. You can also preorder way the warrior kid. And when people read this book,
[01:49:28] it's sort of like when people taste the tea. We're going to have a supply issue. I'm telling you.

[01:51:09] We're talking about Instagram as well. And then again, we're also talking about that Facebook.
[01:51:17] So Andy, what are you on those? Oh, man. On the Instagram, it's my name. Andy Stomp 212. Very original.

[01:51:32] of faces. Yes. I'm contractually obligated to be on there. And Echo is at Echo Charles and I am at
[01:51:41] Jockawlin. Echo. Do you have anything this evening that you want to add to this podcast?
[01:51:48] Man, that's it. You know, usually I have some expound and some expanding question on
[01:51:53] but man, you know, you very articulate. Yeah. I use the words I understand. Two syllables are less.
[01:51:59] Yeah. Dang. Well, I'm saying thanks for having me. Great to meet you, man. I don't need to.
[01:52:06] Andy, any closing thoughts you want to throw out there? No. All I can say is thanks for
[01:52:11] having me on, man. So in 2024, we'll do it again. Now it's great to meet you Echo. I mean,
[01:52:19] I sit back and I love what you guys have going on. So just keep driving ahead, man. It's awesome.
[01:52:25] People need to hear it. Well, I appreciate the feedback you've been given me on the podcast. And obviously,
[01:52:30] thanks for coming on. Sorry. It took so long. Sorry. Everyone. It took so long to get you on. And you know what?
[01:52:34] Bullshit on 2024. We'll get you back on here and we'll do this again. Like 2020. Okay. Yeah.
[01:52:41] And you know, obviously, man, thanks for your service. Yep. And it was my pleasure. And your
[01:52:48] and your continued contribution to the teams and to and your country. So thank you for everything
[01:52:57] you've done. And you know, we started out tonight talking about a debt that cannot be repaid.
[01:53:06] And that is very true. We cannot repay that debt. We owe too much to those that have fallen
[01:53:20] for our freedom. But you know what we can do and what we must do is try.
[01:53:39] Try. Try to live every day with that thought in mind, that thought of the service and of the
[01:53:48] sacrifice of those that gave their last full measure for us, for our freedom. Freedom.
[01:54:07] This nebulous concept that can be so hard for some people to grasp of I will tell you,
[01:54:16] it is a real thing. And it's a thing that's hard to recognize until it is taken from you
[01:54:27] and the chains of oppression control your body and your mind. And then when your freedom is taken away,
[01:54:37] that is when you realize that freedom is the most important thing. The singular thing that gives
[01:54:49] each of us the divine opportunity that only freedom can give to think and to speak and to do as we wish.
[01:55:09] And to do all of those things beholden to no man. And yet while with that freedom,
[01:55:29] we are beholden to no one, let us choose. Let us consciously and deliberately choose
[01:55:45] to be beholden forever be beholden to those men and women who have relinquished their lives
[01:55:54] so selflessly upon the altar of freedom for them be beholden to them let us live
[01:56:12] with purpose and with passion let us live. Live lives worthy of their solemn sacrifice.
[01:56:29] Let us live lives worthy of the price that has been paid worthy of the freedom we are blessed with
[01:56:42] and worthy of those heroes we are forever be beholden to let us live for them.
[01:57:01] And I think that's all I've got for tonight and so until next time this is Andy
[01:57:18] Reneko Enjokol Alt.
