and it's a little bit of the high ground and now going back to the book we began to think about defending against the expected counter attack that we were told would take place in less than 24 hours to bolster our defenses we took turns making special trips back to the still dangerous beach in order to find more automatic weapons ammo and supplies when it was my turn to go down I was horrified at what I saw the debris strewn beach was a disaster area the incoming flooding tide brought with it the bodies of hundreds of our proud regimen scores of our men with bloodstained shirts rolled in the serve among helmets assault jackets gas masks and M1 rifles at the edge of the water I saw burning landing craft that had been trying to deposit a Sherman tank down its ramp the tank was also burning in abandoned from our perspective the battle looked hopeless you know that's something that he said that a couple times he didn't think they were going to win you know despite what can't say they were not going to give up any ground we're guess what I don't know if we're going to be able to hold this ground we might all die here and yet all these men pressed on here's a little here's a little look at the German attitude right here I saw regimental intelligence officer armed with a carbine interrogating a German prisoner the prisoner was on his knees with his hands behind his head he was rather small and frail looking I was surprised to see he was not wearing the usual square shaped battle helmet instead he wore a gray build cap the lieutenant asked the prisoner among other things where the mine fields were the soldier answered only with the accepted Geneva convention requirement of name rank and serial number we had been instructed not to take prisoners for the first two or three days I mean there was times where then this is really famous there was times where they got out of the trenches and played soccer on Christmas day against each other and then the next day go back to slaughter each other crazy that must feel in in this weird way that must feel so good you know to be like like you know like you ever gotten like when you're a kid or even as an adult when you get you know like a argument with someone real bad maybe your friend or or not whatever you get a real bad argument with them and I don't know it lasted there too and they hold up and every one of these head drills becomes like a mini battle and their brutal battles back to the book the site of another terrible death that occurred at this time haunts my dreams to this day my squadron I were digging a machine gun in place may be behind a scrubby head drill we had just finished fixing the camouflage when it happens to you junior officer with field glasses scanning the front I could tell he was a newly arrived replacement his uniform and equipment were relatively new and unworn the sharp report of an 88 millimeter fired from some somewhere nearby and sent me diving at the same time the high explosive missile hit the lieutenant's upper torso the second squadron I were splattered with gore as the spotter was blown backward minus his head number two gunner private first class sal artery vomited and I nearly did too the dreaded German sniper was almost as highly respected as the 88 sharpers shooters gave no warning taking careful aim with sniper scoped mousers the receiving end would hear the sharp crack and instantaneous wind of the bullet if you heard the report of the bullet leaving the muzzle it wasn't for you German snipers nearly always aimed for the head if it was visible and in range most infantry men never removed their helmets except when they shaved and I confess that I slept in mind the 8 millimeter bullet could easily pass through the helmet through the head and out the other side with enough energy left to do more damage I saw men get hit between the eyes or just above the years which killed them instantly if the bullet missed the helmet the entry hole was usually neat and showed only a small trickle of blood but after the steel jacket bullet hit the helmet or the skull the bullet flattened causing the wound to shatter the other side of the head away this start receiving more fire he jumps for cover and then back to the book I climbed back on the path shaking but unscathed within minutes I had another surprise as I approached an opening on the right side of the head draw I heard someone moaning crawling carefully through the opening I came face to face with a young German paratrooper who had been hit by a large chunk of shrapnel he had a very serious upper thigh wound and his left trouser leg was bloody and torn this was my first encounter with the enemy up close the German paratrooper is a fierce and fanatical warrior easily distinguishable by his round helmet and baggy smock my first reaction was to put him out of his misery and keep going I believe he knew what I was thinking he begged dearfully comrade bitta to means friend please he was an impressive looking young soldier about 19 years old my age he was as filthy as I was with long brown stringy hair I'd always thought most German soldiers had short blonde hair he had an athletic build about five feet 10 inches tall about 180 pounds and a handsome face I suspended the promise I had made at the beach about not taking any prisoners I thought this that was then and this is now I just couldn't shoot a wounded human being at point blank range I made sure he didn't have a weapon hidden on him then I tied his belt around his upper thigh which stopped the blood from gushing I gently swabbed the dirt from his wound and applied sulfur powder his winds turned to a forest grin he was in pain so you had I mean you we we we we know that people will fight to the death we know that they get brainwashed him when you look at any history this this sounds like a young kid probably raised from the young very young age as a Nazi as a loyal Nazi just like the Japanese that fall to the death that's what we have here in many cases back to the book combat deaths are ugly and sickening a bullet or piece of red hot shrapnel tears flesh gristle and bone into gruesome wounds a few hours in the sun causes a body to swell grotesquely and turn dark purple the stench is unbearable such deaths were tragic insults to all those handsome young geys just beginning their lives who would not fulfill their dreams many of those killed were like me barely teenagers when they enlisted just starting to grow to maturity in the army those comrades and I spent many happy weekends and furloughs together soaking up culture and drinking bidders shared living quarters ready each other's mail and more significantly shared the misery of training in the most extreme developments the hundred and sixteenth infantry lost from 800 to 1000 men on D. Day and D. Company lost at least 72 of the dead 20 of them were from my hometown of Roanoke five of nine of our officers were killed including capital wall curshilling lieutenant William Gardner lieutenant Merrill Cummings lieutenant Vincent Lobowitz and lieutenant Alton Ashley there were 12 noncombs killed including these rowanokers sergeant James Obenchane staff sergeant You know, I see how I see the difference now in the time where I didn't really know how to relax versus even like the time where I thought I knew how to relax, but after, you know, a 10 minutes, oh, dying versus, you know, now where you can go 10, 20 hard, you know, in fine place where you could relax and be able to basically control the scenarios where you can't relax. I hope you get it when you see your friends wounded and killed two learn to take care of yourself from the start remember the hunt is a crafty intelligent fighter and will not have mercy on you don't have it on him he will try to outwit you beyond the alert three fighting awards the same as any athletic event only wars for keeps it is you or the enemy teamwork is the essence of success we have the tools the best in the world and is up to you to see that they are used properly four remember when you run into the enemy contain him with the minimum to stop him then move around him and strike him in the flank or the rear in all your contacts with him be ruthless always drive hard the hunt doesn't like Yankee drive and guts show him that you have plenty if you close with him use your bayonet show him you can take it and dish it out don't be caught napping don't let your Yankee curiosity get you blown up by a booby trap or a mine five take care of your arms and equipment conserve your ammunition make every shot count keep your weapons clean and oiled their proper functioning at the right time may mean your life every soldier must realize the importance of supply discipline and see that he himself does his part in conserving supplies more than one battle has been lost because munitions and other supplies were not available six do not eat your K and D rations prior to D day D plus one day you won't get anymore until D plus two seven the Navy and air will give us plenty of support general Montgomery was very optimistic and is talked to the officers yesterday at this dip at this time no one knows how much resistance we will meet on D day we may be able to walk in without trouble we may have to fight for your life to meet the worst and make up your minds now that you're going forward regardless and it is a one way ticket we are not giving any ground at any time and we are not leaving until the job is done to each one of you happy landings and come off those craft fight like hell can't um lays it out definitely lays it out You know, you know, you're saying like sometimes where, you know, as a leader, you might be reluctant to ask for suggestions because you might come up like an experience or something like that. or we got to know whatever it's real bad and at the end you guys make up and you guys are like back friends again it's almost like it's such a good feeling maybe because of the contrast or I don't know maybe because I don't know Yeah, because you know how like you're a regional, um, one of your regional things was, you know, you go through life and certain people all they see is is the good thing so they get kind of desensitized to like the just small little good things in life. so we got to know that this demon that we're dealing with now has been around for a long time and you know that's a classic situation where his death Stan Corsiac's death is reported as a non-battle casualty which means no one labeled him a suicide which means how many people did that happen to and it was never captured they wasn't reported and so now we never dealt with it that if you don't deal with things you don't capture the lessons learned if you don't recognize these things how you get a fixum as Bob Slotter pointed out it was almost impossible for one of these guys to go day after day after day and not get wounded and he ended up getting wounded got trapped in a fragment of the bag gets pulled off the battlefield luckily and sent to an English hospital and here's what he says about that it is one thing to visit a wartime army hospital but something quite different and much worse to be a patient in one. so back to the book after I fired my M1 it jammed to clean it I slipped out of my assault jacket and spread my raincoat only to discover bullet holes in my pack and coat suddenly overwhelmed with fear I became weak in the knees my hands shook as I tried to wipe sand from my weapon I had to catch my breath and compose myself by mid morning we had worked out worked our way to the base of the hill men from other units began to gather the regimental commander Colonel Charles DWCanim appeared from down beach with his right arm in a sling and clutch clutching a coat 45 semi-automatic pistol in his bony left hand can't him didn't look like a soldier but his sir's hell was one he was tall and thin were wire rimmed glasses and had a pencil thin mustache he yelled for the officers and noncombs to help him get the men across the beach and up the hill get these men the hell off this god damn beach and go kill some god damn crowds in a nearby pill box a young a lieutenant Colonel taking refuge from the enemy mortar barrage yelled out to cannon Colonel you better take cover you're gonna get killed Colonel canom screamed his reply get your ass out of there and help me get these men off this beach the officer did what cannon ordered so now we got somebody leading serious leader and in the book slaughter put the memorandum from canom that canom wrote to the troops prior to D day and I wore a pitiful sight find yellow dust sifted through the cracks and the roof and stuck to our sweaty skin and eyes if the dust it had been black we would have looked like very tired coal miners the yellow dust turned a mud around our swollen bloodshot eyes when nature called we had to answer in the safety of our slit trunch lying down all the training and experience in the world could not have prepared us for this kind of harassment those box our boxed car side shells sounded like they were flip flopping and over and and screeching straight for our whole this went on hour after hour all day and through the night many good soldiers cracked and who could blame them the long bouts of duty had been taking their toll it was extremely rare for an infantry men to go unscathed for very long many twenty-niners were wounded two three or four times fighting through the hedgeros of Normandy all of us were praying for the million dollar wound which missed vital organs bone and nerves but would give us a long stay in an English hospital sleeping under clean white sheets and at least in fantasy in the care of a beautiful nurse meanwhile battle fatigue and self-inflicted wounds had become serious problems at least once nearly all combat soldiers if they are honest consider shooting themselves in order to get out of the hell of battle self-inflicted wounds however are considered disgraceful and if proven in a court martial offense nevertheless many respectable kia and wounded in action were in reality self-inflicted or friendly fire accidents and then even and it impacted both of them obviously you know where the guy was like hey god bless almost like came in we're in this war I dig it almost like a football gamer something like amen I dig it And then you know, all like, we talked about this before, where if you don't know what you're doing, but you're acting like, you know, you're a pro. Nonetheless, the point is, if you start carrying on, you know, you don't know that you need suggestions, and you say, you know, whatever, I'm just going to move forward by thinking to smell that on you, that you're black like that. yeah that could have happened to you just never know thank now we're gonna start getting crushed with some artillery back to the book Jerry pounded the 116th all day and two nights with blockbuster 155 millimeter and 105 millimeter artillery near misses caused enough concussion to make our ears ring and our heads ache the pounding rounds of salvo after salvo of earthshaking artillery will relentless and frightening during the bombardment I shared a long shallow slit trance with one of my first decompany replacements private Lewis Cass from Chevy Chase Maryland we nicknamed him junior early on because of his boyish looks and demeanor junior was from an affluent family and had volunteered into the army upon graduation from high school he didn't look like the type that could last very long in brutal combat our slit trunch was covered with wooden sheathing atop through the roof of piled dirt like thousands of other infantry soldiers subjected to such heavy bombardment junior So I think I think with other people, you know, some people obviously are not by the ocean, but you know, with anything outside, running hiking, biking, swimming, even playing outdoor sports, like soccer, and shooting basketball outside. yeah does it kind of in a way put into perspective but more shed the light shed light on potentially the overall attitude where you're fighting a war and the enemy is more this entity of an enemy you know it's not like how many kicked this guy's I'm sure it's like it's not personal but it's like it has to have like that kind of feeling when you're in this crazy war you're like I hate this so much hatred and just aggression and opposite you gotta remember this is there's plenty of guys and there's plenty of Germans I got smoked right there without a second Like, you know, well, I don't know if you've been bullied in school, but um, like, if someone's looking for you, they're mad at you or whatever. Well, you know, you got like even Kelly Slater who's, you know, what is either 11-time, 12-time champion of the world in surfing? If you need a suggestion and you're like, oh, I don't want to sound like that or whatever, and you say, you know, whatever, I'm just going to go hit move forward anyway.
