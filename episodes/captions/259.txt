[00:00:00] This is Jockel Podcast number 259 with me, Jockel Willink.
[00:00:05] The A1E's arrived just as the team started taking incoming mortar fire.
[00:00:09] Godwin quickly calculated the coordinates for the mortar's location and the information was passed on to Kavi
[00:00:16] who in turn related to the A1E's.
[00:00:18] A laconic whistling voice came back down the line.
[00:00:21] It's crispy critter time, so y'all keep your heads down.
[00:00:25] Within seconds the area in front of the team exploded into flame.
[00:00:29] The deadly napaam coating everything in its erupting path, flaming NVA soldiers ran briefly
[00:00:35] toward the team before falling to the ground and agonizing death throws.
[00:00:38] The hand grenades and ammunition they carried cooking off like firecrackers.
[00:00:43] Unfortunately, the elephant grass was also set on fire.
[00:00:47] The napaam had definitely slowed the NVA advance, but it had not stopped it.
[00:00:51] Kavi reported that extraction chopper were five minutes out and the team needed to move fast.
[00:00:59] Two gunships from the 7th Air Cav roared over the LZ.
[00:01:04] Watkins put out two bright orange marker panels and the gunships confirmed they had the team
[00:01:09] in sight.
[00:01:10] As they looped back to make their first strafing run, the gunships reported that a large enemy
[00:01:14] force was moving toward the LZ and they were going to attempt to discourage it.
[00:01:20] As they made their run pouring M60 machine gun fire and rockets into the enemy, RT lion
[00:01:26] could see the air filled with green tracers, hating the helicopters.
[00:01:30] They were taking a vicious beating, but they hung in there and kept pouring fire down on
[00:01:35] the NVA.
[00:01:36] It was an incredible show of raw guts and determination.
[00:01:40] Kavi came on the radio to say the gunships had taken casualties and were leaking fuel, oil,
[00:01:45] hydraulic fluid and just about everything else, so they were being forced to head home.
[00:01:49] But the extraction slicks were on station.
[00:01:53] RT lion looked around and could see its salvation coming toward it on its nose.
[00:01:59] Although they were flying at a good clip, it appeared as if they were moving at an agonizingly
[00:02:04] slow speed.
[00:02:06] As with the gunships before them, they were taking a horrendous amount of fire.
[00:02:11] One chopper was hit badly and began losing fuel.
[00:02:15] After a brief confabbed the rescue package suddenly broke off its approach and headed back
[00:02:20] the way it had come, leaving nothing but smoke and RT lion's hopes for rescue behind.
[00:02:27] When Watkins asked Kavi what this meant in terms of time on the ground, all heartness
[00:02:32] could do was say that he'd contact the S3 and ask for a new set of extraction assets
[00:02:37] ASAP.
[00:02:38] In the meantime, he promised to get more tactical air support over the team and do all he could
[00:02:42] to keep them alive.
[00:02:44] While Watkins appreciated the sentiments, this did not do much to raise his spirits.
[00:02:49] In his heart of hearts, he felt the team's position was precarious and likely to get
[00:02:54] much worse and quickly.
[00:02:57] The NVA had literally thousands of men it could throw at the team while the team had
[00:03:02] only so much ammunition and not much by way of cover.
[00:03:07] What he told his team members however was that there was going to be a slight delay and
[00:03:11] reminded them to keep vigilant and be ready for an attack.
[00:03:15] What he didn't have the heart to tell them was it could be hours before another rescue
[00:03:19] attempt was made.
[00:03:22] Their stay at Oscar A was far from over.
[00:03:24] One of the bruise suddenly signaled that NVA troops were crawling toward the team through
[00:03:28] the elephant grass.
[00:03:29] The news was passed on to Kavi who responded that he had two A1E standing by one loaded
[00:03:34] with CBUs and the other with rockets.
[00:03:37] Both aircraft had their deadly 20mm cannons locked and loaded.
[00:03:41] rockets told Kavi to bring in the CBUs fast as possible and delay it down as close to the
[00:03:45] team as they could get.
[00:03:47] In less than two minutes, the team saw an A1E appear in front of their position.
[00:03:52] It's 20mm cannons roaring away.
[00:03:55] It flew so low they could see the pilot turn his head to locate the team as he released
[00:04:00] his ordinance.
[00:04:02] Unfortunately some of the mini bombs exploded so close to RT Lyon that two bruise
[00:04:06] received light wounds.
[00:04:12] This was distressing but walk-ins consider it one of the acceptable prices a recontain paid
[00:04:14] to keep from being overrun by a superior force.
[00:04:19] As the A1E is departed a small group of NVA suddenly rose up out of the grass behind the
[00:04:24] team and charged them, AK-47's blazing on full automatic.
[00:04:28] DeSetta, his red communist star facing forward rose up and opened fire at near point
[00:04:34] blank range.
[00:04:35] The broo joined in as other groups of NVA popped up from the elephant grass and attempted
[00:04:39] assault after assault.
[00:04:41] What followed was several hours of deadly cat and mouse with the mouse hunkered down and
[00:04:46] it's a little hole and the NVA cat making poss-wipe after poss-wipe in attempt to claw
[00:04:51] it out or do it in.
[00:04:54] And ironic situation for the team to find itself in.
[00:04:59] While RT Lyon fended off attacks, Kavi directed air strike after air strike at the NVA
[00:05:04] troops, the storage area, the anti-aircraft guns and anything else he could draw a bead
[00:05:09] on.
[00:05:11] Throughout the day, primary and secondary explosions followed one another as the strikes
[00:05:15] found their mark.
[00:05:17] Whenever the team's fate, whatever the team's fate might turn out to be, the NVA were
[00:05:22] paying a hellacious price for messing with it.
[00:05:26] With daylight, ammunition and ideas running out, it was like a true message from God when
[00:05:32] Watkins heard Kavi report that South Vietnamese Air Force 219 Special Operations Squadron
[00:05:39] had one of its legendary King Bees and route.
[00:05:43] For once, Watkins spirits actually rose.
[00:05:48] Not that he didn't love the living daylights out of the 7th Air Cavs, but the Vietnamese
[00:05:52] of the 219th had time after time after time, proven themselves to be about the most daring,
[00:06:00] most imaginative, most aggressive, and all around finest pilots on the face of the globe.
[00:06:07] If RT Lyon had any chance of getting out of this hellhole, a King Beep pilot was the one
[00:06:12] who would find it and exploit it no matter how slight the chance was or how deadly the odds.
[00:06:20] That was simply what they were pledged and committed to doing day after day.
[00:06:26] Our good news followed when Kavi relayed that the lone King Be would be escorted by Marine
[00:06:31] gunships from 8ML367, a bad bunch of fires that went by the code named Scarface.
[00:06:39] Things were definitely going to rock and roll with them on station.
[00:06:42] Scarface enjoyed nothing more than kicking NVA but and taking names and then coming back
[00:06:46] around to kick more but just for good measure.
[00:06:50] On general principle and for the sheer fun of it.
[00:06:55] However Kavi splashed a healthy dose of cold water on walkins by reminding him it was very
[00:07:00] nearly dark and that despite all the bombs dropped, rockets fired and gun runs made.
[00:07:05] The enemy was still pumping out an enormous amount of fire and still moving forward.
[00:07:10] Pulling RT Lyon out of Oscar was going to be as difficult and dangerous in extraction
[00:07:15] as could be imagined.
[00:07:17] And they would have just one chance to pull it off.
[00:07:20] If they muffed it, RT Lyon would be spending the night and would most likely not see the
[00:07:25] next morning.
[00:07:27] So-boring information indeed but walkins did not want to discourage his team so he just
[00:07:31] gave them his best grin and said let's get ready to go.
[00:07:37] In the distance walkins could hear the distinctive sound of the old 9 piston, Sechorsky
[00:07:43] H34 King Beech shoving its way along a steady base note to the higher walk-wop of the
[00:07:49] Louise.
[00:07:50] He squinted into the twilight and when he could finally make out their dim silhouettes,
[00:07:55] he flashed his stroke through the barrel of an M79 grenade launcher so as to mask it from
[00:08:01] enemy sight.
[00:08:03] The helicopter's acknowledged having RT Lyon's mark and the Louise immediately divided
[00:08:09] and made a split run, one raking the team's forward perimeter with rockets and machine gun
[00:08:13] fire and the other working its rear.
[00:08:15] It was a beautiful show.
[00:08:18] The walkins yelled over the noise to blow all the claymores by setting off all the claymores
[00:08:22] at once he hoped to avoid having any uninvited NVA join the team.
[00:08:27] They went off in a deafening blast and blinding flash, the little mouse had roared.
[00:08:33] As the scar face duo looped around to make their second final run, they confirmed there
[00:08:38] were dozens of dead and dying NVA scattered around within feet of the bomb crater.
[00:08:43] Unfortunately they also saw more troops advancing.
[00:08:46] It was down to the short strokes.
[00:08:50] As the scar face gunships began their last pass, the king be tucked itself in behind
[00:08:55] them and came roaring on.
[00:08:58] Rather than sat down outside the crater and have the team come to him, as Watkins fully
[00:09:03] expected the pilot pulled up and hovered over the crater.
[00:09:07] As the team looked up and disbelief, the old aged 34 warbird began gently settling itself
[00:09:13] down toward the team like a mother hand about to cover her chicks.
[00:09:17] Thus also decreasing the silhouette to enemy troops.
[00:09:21] By the light of the burning elephant grass, Watkins was able to see into the king bees
[00:09:27] cocked it and was startled to find the copilot seat empty.
[00:09:33] In the pilot seat was as much admired friend Captain On, a man who had saved Watkins
[00:09:40] bacon on many other occasions, but none quite like what he faced here at Oscar 8.
[00:09:47] Captain On lowered his king be toward the team with a precision and steadiness that
[00:09:52] gave an entirely new meaning to the word cool.
[00:09:56] His face was smooth and calm, but there was steel in his eyes as he worked both feet
[00:10:00] and hands to maneuver the choppers close to RT line as he could.
[00:10:04] At one point Watkins could have sworn that On nodded to him as if an occasional greeting.
[00:10:09] The whole scene bordered on surrealistic.
[00:10:13] What would the LZ lit by a flickering brush fire, the sounds of gunfire and explosions,
[00:10:18] the smell of cordite and burned human flesh, and this improbable savior hovering above.
[00:10:26] As Watkins had experienced before, the action took on a dreamlike quality sounds faded as
[00:10:31] if someone had turned down the volume, the air thickened, movement appeared to be in slow
[00:10:35] motion, and the brain snapped individual frames that would never ever be forgotten.
[00:10:40] The looks of fear or pain on their faces, bodies being blasted backward, a piece of
[00:10:45] someone on the ground, a scrap of cloth, one's own hand clutching a weapon or shaking wildly
[00:10:50] as it tries to execute some simple well rehearsed, but now impossible difficult task.
[00:10:55] This is what Watkins looks like to a mind-understress.
[00:10:59] Watkins could hear small arms fire thumping into the king be as body as he fully expected
[00:11:04] that at any moment it would either pull up an exit or come crashing down on them.
[00:11:10] But it did neither.
[00:11:11] It settled into a stationary hover, its front wheels placed delicately inside the crater.
[00:11:19] And there it sat, an unbelievable vision, a heroic portrait of an old warrior taking a pounding
[00:11:25] but refusing to falter.
[00:11:29] Watkins, DeSata, and Godwin begin heaving the brew into the chopper.
[00:11:34] Godwin followed.
[00:11:35] DeSata after taking an anxious look at his team leader was next, his bright red star pointed
[00:11:41] over his right ear as if he wasn't quite sure whether he wanted to be going or staying.
[00:11:46] Finally in accordance with that time-honored tradition, the one-zero feet with a last
[00:11:51] to leave the killing ground of Oscar eight.
[00:11:55] With the door gunner and team pouring small arms fire and M79 rounds into the perimeter
[00:12:00] beyond its rim, the king lifted up and out of the crater.
[00:12:07] As a last to find gesture, Watkins threw a red smoke grenade onto the LZ.
[00:12:11] This gesture was universally understood by everyone who supported Saga to signal that
[00:12:16] the team was safely out, the LZ clear and everyone else was free to pound the living
[00:12:21] daylights out of it.
[00:12:24] Their RT line was not home-free, not yet at least.
[00:12:29] Anti-aircraft rounds were bursting around them like a World War II Akak fire.
[00:12:33] Captain Onn was dipping and juking in an effort to judge the dodge the bursts and make
[00:12:38] himself harder to track.
[00:12:40] He still looked calm, cool, and collected as if he were making a routine flight.
[00:12:46] For these guys, Watkins, maybe this was a routine flight.
[00:12:52] In the king be touched down a case on, Tassada, Godwin, and the grinning door gunner walked
[00:12:58] around poking their fingers into bullet holes and counting them.
[00:13:02] But they soon gave up.
[00:13:04] There were too many.
[00:13:06] In besides it was just too unsettling, unsettling to contemplate what might have been.
[00:13:13] Watkins learned later that Captain Onn had chosen to fly solo in the Oscar eight because
[00:13:19] he knew exactly how dangerous this mission was.
[00:13:23] He'd lost King Bees there before and was determined not to risk more lives than necessary.
[00:13:31] He figured if the gods were damed that his ship go down while trying to save RT line,
[00:13:36] it would just be him and the door gunner.
[00:13:40] It seemed like a simple and perfectly logical decision.
[00:13:43] No big deal.
[00:13:46] Incredibly everyone who participated in the mission was alive and well.
[00:13:51] But men of RT line were home, seasoned veterans of Oscar eight.
[00:13:56] It had indeed been there time after all.
[00:14:06] So that is a whole different kind of heroism.
[00:14:18] Because look when you're on the ground, in many cases you don't even have a choice,
[00:14:24] but to be a hero.
[00:14:26] You either step up or you die.
[00:14:31] But for these pilots, men like Captain Onn, they don't really have to do anything heroic.
[00:14:42] They could easily say that the landing zones too hot or they've already been shot or
[00:14:45] the low on fuel or whatever.
[00:14:51] But they're safe in their aircraft.
[00:14:54] And they see the hell that is going on and they see the hell that they are going into.
[00:14:59] They call it's and rockets and anti-aircraft and they go anyway.
[00:15:07] They go anyway.
[00:15:10] Men like Captain Noin Key Arn, a pilot in the South Vietnamese Air Force who flew countless
[00:15:18] missions in saintly dangerous missions in support of American and South Vietnamese
[00:15:24] sog teams. These are recipient of the silver star and the distinguished flying cross.
[00:15:33] And it is an absolute honor to have Captain Onn with us here to talk about his experience
[00:15:39] in fighting in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia.
[00:15:44] Captain Onn, it's an absolute honor to have here.
[00:15:49] But I guess also joining us once again is John Strike or Meyer, till Special Forces member
[00:15:58] of Sog who has been on this podcast before.
[00:16:01] Couple times 180, 1801, 1802, 1806 with the Frenchman, 247, 248 and the last one with
[00:16:09] cowboy con.
[00:16:10] Cowboys.
[00:16:11] 258 back again.
[00:16:14] Thank you so much.
[00:16:16] And when you first came on after the first couple times people started asking almost immediately
[00:16:23] to if I could find a king bee pilot.
[00:16:27] And I know as soon as you very quickly mentioned Captain Onn.
[00:16:32] Always.
[00:16:34] Number one king bee.
[00:16:35] For sure.
[00:16:36] Thank you.
[00:16:39] So on tell us about what it was like growing up.
[00:16:42] Where did you grow up?
[00:16:43] I would grow up at Hanway, not at Vietnam.
[00:16:50] My father decided to move to family to the South in 1954.
[00:16:56] That was after the French got beat.
[00:17:00] So did your father recognize the bad things could happen?
[00:17:03] Yes.
[00:17:04] And what did your father do for a living?
[00:17:07] Did you meet before in the 55th of the 54th?
[00:17:14] He has some kind of business to cut the lumber.
[00:17:17] Like a long ago.
[00:17:19] He high people to do it when he organized the office.
[00:17:25] And after the 54th we moved down to the South.
[00:17:34] They looked for one of the French company.
[00:17:40] He worked for a French company?
[00:17:41] Yes.
[00:17:42] Okay.
[00:17:43] After the 54th.
[00:17:44] Then he moved to the South.
[00:17:46] Okay.
[00:17:47] And what did you do?
[00:17:48] How old were you when you moved to the South?
[00:17:50] I was 15, 11.
[00:17:52] 11 years old.
[00:17:53] Yeah.
[00:17:54] And my father sent my son and my brother.
[00:17:58] A young brother at that time, he was 10 and to try to with one of the French to the South.
[00:18:08] Now did you have any understanding of what was happening with the communist and North Vietnam?
[00:18:14] Did you have any understanding of that yet?
[00:18:18] Before we went to the South, then I remember.
[00:18:28] At night, I see the next to my father.
[00:18:33] He was a police officer, a police officer, a police officer, which he made because my
[00:18:42] brother, who was killed in 45.
[00:18:49] When he was 17.
[00:18:51] Okay.
[00:18:52] By the communist.
[00:18:53] The communist.
[00:18:54] Yeah.
[00:18:55] So, once you got down the South Vietnam, now you're 11 years old.
[00:19:01] And what did you do?
[00:19:03] Were you just going to school?
[00:19:04] Yes, I did.
[00:19:06] And since we moved around on the time, I know it to high funk and then go to the South.
[00:19:18] And my brother, next to me, we are on try to make a two great in one year.
[00:19:27] You try to make what in one year?
[00:19:28] Two great.
[00:19:29] Okay.
[00:19:30] Were you able to do it?
[00:19:33] Yeah.
[00:19:34] Okay.
[00:19:35] We did.
[00:19:36] Nice.
[00:19:37] Nice.
[00:19:37] And in 62.
[00:19:41] In 62, I was on the Air Force.
[00:19:48] My brother, he got a scholarship from Usham and he went here too.
[00:19:54] So 1962 is when you joined the Air Force.
[00:19:58] And once you joined the Air Force, did you know you were going to be a pilot?
[00:20:03] Yes.
[00:20:04] Okay.
[00:20:05] But I didn't believe that I would be.
[00:20:12] I couldn't ride the car, I couldn't ride air.
[00:20:14] You were there when you were even ever in a bus.
[00:20:18] Because every time I got in the car, my stomach was like, come up to my mouth.
[00:20:24] You're a car, sir.
[00:20:26] Chaucic train, sir.
[00:20:28] Every day.
[00:20:29] Here we get.
[00:20:30] Yeah, that's not fun.
[00:20:32] But eventually you were able to get over that?
[00:20:34] Yes.
[00:20:35] The first time I'm my IP, he demonstrated the engine quit all the oral total tasting.
[00:20:45] And I feel my stomach is coming up.
[00:20:50] I can't hear how can I fly.
[00:20:53] But they are on, I get used with it.
[00:20:55] Right.
[00:20:56] And I like it.
[00:21:00] I know that they have something for American pilots.
[00:21:03] And I don't know if they made you do this.
[00:21:04] They have something where if you get air sickness, they have something I think it's in
[00:21:08] taxes.
[00:21:09] It's called Spin and Puk.
[00:21:11] And they basically put you in this machine every day and it spins you around and makes
[00:21:15] you sick until you get used to it.
[00:21:17] Really?
[00:21:18] Yep.
[00:21:19] So I guess you didn't do that.
[00:21:22] No.
[00:21:23] You didn't have to go to the Spin and Puk.
[00:21:26] One auto rotation helps.
[00:21:29] So how long were you in the Air Force before you started training to become a pilot?
[00:21:36] When I was in Air Force in late 1962, and formerly it was on the very first of the 63.
[00:21:51] I was having the basic terminally training in the Nya Shank for the ESI-off course.
[00:21:59] So for six months.
[00:22:02] And in Zurai, 63, I was sent here to get a tiny.
[00:22:12] So you came to America?
[00:22:13] Yeah, and got the ESI-algan training in the industry.
[00:22:17] In the San Antonio.
[00:22:18] Okay.
[00:22:19] So you go to San Antonio to first of all, how to speak English?
[00:22:26] Oh, in Vietnam.
[00:22:29] Okay.
[00:22:30] When I kept the ability to be literally training and the ESI-al in English training for
[00:22:38] six months, and then when I went to the San Antonio Tigers, another four months for
[00:22:47] ESL in English, in English, after that I went to four waters in Texas.
[00:22:56] Okay.
[00:22:57] And what was the first one?
[00:22:58] The first one was for?
[00:22:59] Probably, how do you go to training?
[00:23:02] Okay.
[00:23:03] Is the ESI-algan training three?
[00:23:06] The ESI-23.
[00:23:07] The ESI-23.
[00:23:08] The ESI-23.
[00:23:09] It's small and ugly.
[00:23:12] That's like the bubble canopy, right?
[00:23:15] Simultaneously.
[00:23:16] Yeah, it's a very, very old one.
[00:23:19] And then, so how long did you spend in America training the fly?
[00:23:27] From the first training, I had the advanced training on ESI-23, to then after
[00:23:37] happiness, I went to Alabama to get the training on the ESL-24.
[00:23:44] The Kingby.
[00:23:45] The Kingby.
[00:23:46] What was your first impression of the Kingby?
[00:23:48] It was big.
[00:23:49] Because it was from the ESI-23.
[00:23:53] It was small one.
[00:23:54] It was training one.
[00:23:56] And when I finished the training on the ESI-24, I was thankful to get the training on the
[00:24:09] Huey.
[00:24:10] At that time, they only have the school.
[00:24:13] They only have the A model.
[00:24:15] It's a smaller one.
[00:24:18] The A model Huey?
[00:24:19] Yeah.
[00:24:20] What did you like better?
[00:24:21] The Huey or the Kingby?
[00:24:23] It's a kidney.
[00:24:25] It's a kidney.
[00:24:27] It had the Bail.
[00:24:28] At that time, it was about 150 hundred house power.
[00:24:33] But the Huey wasn't A model.
[00:24:36] He was only 900 house power.
[00:24:40] But the Huey is a lot smaller than the Kingby.
[00:24:43] Yes, it is small.
[00:24:46] But did you feel like you had more power in the Kingby?
[00:24:48] No.
[00:24:49] No.
[00:24:50] Because it's too easy.
[00:24:51] Too easy to fry.
[00:24:53] What's that one?
[00:24:55] Because on the ESI-24, I got told about how it's.
[00:25:05] How many hours?
[00:25:06] Hundred hours.
[00:25:07] Wow.
[00:25:09] But on the Huey, I only had the 900 hours.
[00:25:14] Okay.
[00:25:15] And the pilot, Captain Bylode, who checked me, he said,
[00:25:21] Okay.
[00:25:22] He's a good stay home.
[00:25:23] You don't need to fry anymore.
[00:25:26] He's the home.
[00:25:27] He can have more time to take out of people.
[00:25:30] God.
[00:25:31] Other people don't learn as quickly as he did.
[00:25:33] God.
[00:25:34] So I was awful one week and this girl ran.
[00:25:38] So then, so is that what you got trained in?
[00:25:43] You completed all that training.
[00:25:45] And then it was going back to Vietnam.
[00:25:48] Yes, in the 61.
[00:25:51] Around the Zoolai 64.
[00:25:54] So in 64 America's there, but not super heavy engaged in combat operations yet.
[00:26:03] What was it like when you got back?
[00:26:05] Were you starting to anticipate?
[00:26:08] Were you starting to seem like there was going to be a broader war being fought there?
[00:26:13] Don't forget, June on 1964, Roger Dollen, earned the first Medal of Honor at a Green
[00:26:19] Brey camp.
[00:26:21] So there were major battles at the A camps, at that level.
[00:26:26] And so, and the course that King Bees, even then, were supporting somebody at the A camps.
[00:26:30] So that was the beginning of that war at a serious level.
[00:26:34] And yes, we didn't get the American troops involved to hydranny Valley, but they began to build up
[00:26:38] the Marines came into today.
[00:26:40] So he was all part of that.
[00:26:42] What year did the Marines come into the day?
[00:26:44] There was 64 I think.
[00:26:45] Yes, 64, 64, 64, 64.
[00:26:47] Yeah, because it's always hydrang in 65.
[00:26:51] That sort of, in my mind, marks the beginning of like heavy American combat operations.
[00:26:57] Yes, it has a formal battle between American first cab and the NVA.
[00:27:02] So, but yeah, definitely prior to that, it was advisors in their working by-with-and-through
[00:27:08] the locals.
[00:27:10] Right.
[00:27:11] And yeah.
[00:27:13] So you are seeing all that happen.
[00:27:15] You're seeing that start to unfold.
[00:27:17] Where you, at what point did you start flying the King Bees in support of special operations?
[00:27:23] When I first came back from the U.S. training, I was assigned to the...
[00:27:31] 2017 squad.
[00:27:34] And the 2017 squad, the first station at Saigon.
[00:27:39] And in the 60, later 65, was moved to Cantel in the south.
[00:27:48] And in February, 1966, I was assigned to the 80-thirds of the military.
[00:28:00] The 80-thirds group.
[00:28:03] This is the group that combine face-wing and helicopter to verify the sacred mission.
[00:28:11] And later on, the helicopter-through group become a two-nineteen.
[00:28:20] But the group of the 80, the helicopter group in 80-thirds,
[00:28:25] and it's basically a heavy-fledged helicopter.
[00:28:30] But when we become, became the two-nineteen, we have about 34 of them.
[00:28:37] Did you know what you were getting into?
[00:28:40] Yeah.
[00:28:41] Were those kind of...
[00:28:42] I like it.
[00:28:44] And because he's very modest.
[00:28:46] The first two years, basically, from...
[00:28:49] He went to the first the 2017, the commander that didn't like North Vietnamese.
[00:28:55] So he was only a cop-out.
[00:28:57] But he applied cop-out.
[00:28:58] He gave very bored, he wants more action.
[00:29:00] So he finally gets to be questioned.
[00:29:02] And he goes and gets the action.
[00:29:07] So once you started doing that, what was that like?
[00:29:11] What was it like to start going out on those operations where there was all this incredible intensity on the ground?
[00:29:18] Oh, I think he's more excited than in a normal squad.
[00:29:26] Yeah, I'd say it's probably more exciting than in a normal squadron.
[00:29:31] Oh, dude.
[00:29:34] What was the operational pace like?
[00:29:39] How often were you getting called to fly?
[00:29:42] What would happen?
[00:29:43] Would you be on standby waiting to go extract people?
[00:29:47] Would you sit and plan with the guys from SOG?
[00:29:50] So you all were working together?
[00:29:52] How did all that work?
[00:29:55] Everything.
[00:29:56] I woke up like that.
[00:29:58] Because they had a rotation.
[00:30:00] Like one week they would be on assignment, one week they'd be training.
[00:30:04] And another week they'd be getting ready.
[00:30:06] And then one week or so they'd be on a side.
[00:30:08] They could be able to food by.
[00:30:09] Yeah.
[00:30:10] Then they go down a contone.
[00:30:11] Wherever the most bending on a weather, what missions were up.
[00:30:15] So would SOG ground guys go and, you know, would you sit down and say, okay,
[00:30:20] here's where we're going to insert.
[00:30:21] Here's where we go up, order.
[00:30:22] And they would be in for the briefing.
[00:30:24] Practing on.
[00:30:25] Before we went out to the operation that we have the briefing.
[00:30:29] What we are going to do and where we are going to work.
[00:30:34] But since I was also familiar with the whole board from
[00:30:41] Hesign down to Praco, Mami to the whole water around the island.
[00:30:49] And always the whole team in 12.
[00:30:51] I'm so familiar with it.
[00:30:53] I just, yeah.
[00:30:54] I don't need to bring map.
[00:30:56] You were that familiar with it.
[00:30:58] Yeah.
[00:30:59] Here's another thing.
[00:31:00] During those briefings, when they're there as a one zero,
[00:31:04] the king bees, as we went further into the war,
[00:31:07] we were saying we found 23 mic mic here.
[00:31:11] 37 mic anti-aircraft weaponry in those targets.
[00:31:15] So they would tell the cubby and their expertise would be another bonus
[00:31:19] that we had in terms of our briefing.
[00:31:21] We're not the fly.
[00:31:23] That's one of the briefing parts.
[00:31:25] So it's like we hear what the mission was.
[00:31:27] Get that from S3.
[00:31:28] But we'd always hear from them than the cubby after that.
[00:31:32] Oh yeah.
[00:31:34] So you'd be flying basically some kind of combat mission every day
[00:31:39] or two days, three days at the most.
[00:31:41] Oh, sometimes in one day we are through a three mission.
[00:31:47] It's mission last about less than two hours.
[00:31:52] Yeah.
[00:31:53] Yeah, see, that's what's cool about being a pilot, right?
[00:31:55] Two hours, you know, two hours in your dog.
[00:31:58] If you live to come home, you're going to have to come home.
[00:32:01] You're doing all right.
[00:32:03] You're back eating good shall and drinking a cold beer.
[00:32:06] Indeed.
[00:32:07] So how long did it take before you finally ended up getting shot down?
[00:32:15] Ooh.
[00:32:17] They should get.
[00:32:18] Like when did I know you ended up getting shot down?
[00:32:21] How long were you flying for before you got shot down for the first time?
[00:32:24] Over four years.
[00:32:25] Over four years.
[00:32:26] Over five years.
[00:32:27] Over five years.
[00:32:28] Over seven times.
[00:32:33] I don't remember.
[00:32:34] Because I was at that point high at four times.
[00:32:37] And I was at that point four times.
[00:32:39] Yeah.
[00:32:40] I don't remember.
[00:32:41] I don't even remember which day we were at that.
[00:32:44] I said the last time I lost my hand.
[00:32:46] Can you remember that?
[00:32:48] Yeah.
[00:32:49] The first time you got shot.
[00:32:50] You don't really remember what happened.
[00:32:51] The first time you got shot down.
[00:32:52] Oh.
[00:32:53] The first time I was shot down was in south of the Mabu mountain.
[00:32:59] And in the morning we suppose to take the.
[00:33:04] They put to make the security line south of the Mabu mountain.
[00:33:11] And in Marble, Mabu, right where F would be four was.
[00:33:14] So this is the in country mission.
[00:33:16] And they're picking up a batting to put it on the south side of Marble, Mabu.
[00:33:19] Because F would be four was on a north side.
[00:33:22] And they were having some issues.
[00:33:23] They put the batting out there for security purposes.
[00:33:26] The work and the long with the Marines at that point.
[00:33:29] And so something clocked in the morning.
[00:33:31] South Vietnam.
[00:33:32] He gets shot down.
[00:33:34] Yeah.
[00:33:35] Yeah.
[00:33:36] And I will now at sea so clock.
[00:33:38] And in South the.
[00:33:41] I'm a drop the.
[00:33:43] The two.
[00:33:44] And when the second king, the land.
[00:33:48] And he said that he kept.
[00:33:50] He kept. He caught the.
[00:33:52] The ground fine.
[00:33:53] And I told him.
[00:33:55] Remember which way.
[00:33:57] And.
[00:33:59] And I come back to.
[00:34:00] Mabu mountain pick up more people.
[00:34:02] And then land again.
[00:34:05] And I see which.
[00:34:07] Which direction is that.
[00:34:09] He said to a clock.
[00:34:11] And I take up and have to two two.
[00:34:13] A couple of.
[00:34:14] A little direction.
[00:34:15] And I saw a line of the people.
[00:34:18] And I was moving.
[00:34:20] With the.
[00:34:21] I was.
[00:34:22] I was a woman and she got killed.
[00:34:25] And with the.
[00:34:26] But you know, Mabu too much.
[00:34:28] The carry.
[00:34:29] Yes.
[00:34:30] Yeah.
[00:34:30] And I told the.
[00:34:32] The.
[00:34:33] The.
[00:34:34] The.
[00:34:35] The people.
[00:34:36] The civilian people.
[00:34:37] The.
[00:34:38] The.
[00:34:39] The.
[00:34:39] The.
[00:34:39] And as long as I.
[00:34:41] I.
[00:34:42] I.
[00:34:43] I.
[00:34:44] A.
[00:34:45] A.
[00:34:45] A.
[00:34:46] Long.
[00:34:47] The.
[00:34:57] But the.
[00:34:59] The.
[00:35:00] And.
[00:35:03] The.
[00:35:05] The third shop.
[00:35:06] The.
[00:35:07] The.
[00:35:10] People were fake.
[00:35:11] During.
[00:35:13] XV.
[00:35:14] I was like, wow, wow, again, to take the child back.
[00:35:19] And we took the child back.
[00:35:22] The mechanic couldn't find any round.
[00:35:27] So, we keep asking me, tell them, tell them, tell them,
[00:35:35] what happened, what really happened.
[00:35:38] We couldn't find any round, then it must be the technical problem.
[00:35:45] I said, yes, I heard the round earlier, it was fire.
[00:35:52] Later, in the afternoon, one of the mechanic ships,
[00:35:58] he opened the Fondar of the engine.
[00:36:06] He looked around.
[00:36:10] Suddenly, he saw the cap of the needle.
[00:36:19] That was the whole thing.
[00:36:21] That was it.
[00:36:23] He was wondering, why is it this?
[00:36:26] That is the whole thing.
[00:36:29] The people didn't change it.
[00:36:31] So, he could call the mechanic and open it.
[00:36:35] My wallet was in there.
[00:36:38] And that makes it harder to ignite it.
[00:36:41] So, you would go back out and you went back out and recovered that aircraft?
[00:36:46] Yeah.
[00:36:47] Would you tie straps onto it and bring it back or how to do it?
[00:36:51] I go, go out and we did to sew them, how to bring it down the aircraft back.
[00:37:00] Would you bring it back with another helicopter?
[00:37:02] Yeah.
[00:37:03] Tie it on and bring it back and then start working on it.
[00:37:06] Did you feel jinks to go back in that aircraft again?
[00:37:09] Yeah.
[00:37:10] Like, you don't know.
[00:37:13] Or did you feel lucky?
[00:37:15] You already got shot down, you made it.
[00:37:18] You don't win.
[00:37:20] I was in the rice paddy.
[00:37:24] I saw the amount of the chocolate and the amount of the I'm turning.
[00:37:32] The old one, the old two, remember seeing that.
[00:37:36] And then my true shape, bring a little bit of candy, the arm of the box.
[00:37:41] And my co-pie, he ran along with me.
[00:37:46] When I went back to the I'm literally, I looked back and I saw the one.
[00:37:53] The water on the rice paddy was fairly done.
[00:37:57] Because in the front day they were sweating from the wheelies.
[00:38:01] Oh, yeah.
[00:38:02] Still.
[00:38:03] And then to the bottom of the rice paddy and put it again with the machine gunner and loaded and I shot it.
[00:38:13] I got idiot, worked.
[00:38:15] Only one round in the time.
[00:38:18] I didn't want to see it.
[00:38:25] It was all 30 calories.
[00:38:27] We're not the most reliable after the first 30 years of combat.
[00:38:31] I know there's another story where you got shot down again after.
[00:38:39] And the day before, King B had been shot down and then you went into, what happened on that operation?
[00:38:45] The day before we went out and to be surprised and bring the wound from the team.
[00:39:00] And I ran and picked up some, and I resuppied some.
[00:39:05] The second one, let's hide there by the RPC.
[00:39:09] And it was about 5 p.m.
[00:39:16] And when they saw it, I came back to the back toe.
[00:39:27] And now we lost two things every time.
[00:39:31] Yeah, two things on the previous day.
[00:39:35] And I decided, how did you feel about going on an operation when there was two King B shot down the day before?
[00:39:43] And now you have to go back in there. What did that feel like?
[00:39:48] I think that we need to bring the honor by friend, right?
[00:39:56] And when I went to an doctor, the radio man from the camp, he went out and he said,
[00:40:09] all the from side gone, no two men anymore.
[00:40:12] And he lowered his spine, but the last decision is yours.
[00:40:21] And I said, oh, I'm going to go again.
[00:40:26] And I asked it to go V and the two Renship and my number three, number four.
[00:40:34] King B. I will go in again and when we were about, yeah, I told him,
[00:40:48] that's a follow me. And when we were about five kilometers from the L.D.
[00:40:58] then you people were just updating.
[00:41:01] And I will go now by myself.
[00:41:04] And I wait until 7 o'clock, a 7 p.m. is dark.
[00:41:13] And I say, let's go. And I turn out on my light.
[00:41:19] Even the last one, light.
[00:41:23] Turn them off. Turn them off.
[00:41:25] Very, very, very, very, very faint.
[00:41:28] How to see it.
[00:41:30] And because anyway, for a far, far, far, long, high,
[00:41:36] far, I can listen to the engine and know how much data it was working.
[00:41:45] And how much I know how many L.P.M. is running.
[00:41:49] I can listen to it.
[00:41:51] And when you were about five kilometers from the L.D.
[00:41:57] I turned off the light and tell other people to a little bit wait for me.
[00:42:03] And I asked the Kobi, do you see me?
[00:42:07] And he said that, yes.
[00:42:11] So I turned off the engine and go down, go down to the top or to three.
[00:42:18] Rikovil. And I see him again.
[00:42:21] Do you see me? And he said, yes.
[00:42:24] Okay, guide me.
[00:42:26] And you guys tell the light, light, light, light.
[00:42:30] And the L.D.R. had and make a 360 with a 90, 90, not go my 360 degree to land on the L.D.
[00:42:41] So they were walking you in and telling the Kobi was telling you to tell the Kobi was telling me.
[00:42:47] Guide me.
[00:42:49] Yeah.
[00:42:50] At night.
[00:42:52] At three top.
[00:42:54] In the jungle, this is in the mountains here.
[00:42:57] It's not like for flying a camp, booty, where it's flat.
[00:43:01] He's flying over the hills to just, and that's just part of one another day with a king be pile at night.
[00:43:09] With the lights out.
[00:43:10] And he got to everybody out.
[00:43:12] Mm-hmm.
[00:43:14] And the next day, I came in again.
[00:43:19] And at the 10 am.
[00:43:23] And when I was ticking off.
[00:43:26] And I heard a big brush.
[00:43:31] And they said, the chopper started to make up.
[00:43:37] Because the engine was last.
[00:43:40] The brush broke up.
[00:43:42] Yeah, broke up.
[00:43:43] We broke up the engine.
[00:43:44] Wait, what broke up the engine?
[00:43:46] Yeah, they didn't fire.
[00:43:47] It was hit by the RPE.
[00:43:50] Okay, guide me the phone.
[00:43:52] Yeah.
[00:43:57] I make it the right move to keep the joppers.
[00:44:02] Go stick to the side of the hill.
[00:44:06] And still, I'm a start-of-the-loaded road.
[00:44:10] I load the left side down to a so it can hold on the side of the hill.
[00:44:16] And it's just mud.
[00:44:19] And I say that the koppai, when I come out, I get koppai.
[00:44:31] He always on my other left eye.
[00:44:33] And I said, the run.
[00:44:35] So let's do the next.
[00:44:36] I get this.
[00:44:37] Your aircraft gets hit with an RPG.
[00:44:40] Yeah.
[00:44:41] The engine dies.
[00:44:42] The engine came off.
[00:44:43] The engine came off.
[00:44:44] Yeah, it blew off the engine.
[00:44:46] Okay.
[00:44:47] So now the chopper goes nose up.
[00:44:51] Yeah.
[00:44:52] You're going to crash land and you have to do it on a hillside.
[00:44:55] Yeah.
[00:44:55] And so you had to maneuver the helicopter to be at the angle.
[00:44:59] Yeah.
[00:45:00] So you won't be falling a little road out of the hill.
[00:45:03] And then, so you land it.
[00:45:05] Basically, you are able to crash land it.
[00:45:08] And then you look your koppai and say, run.
[00:45:12] And then have to heal up.
[00:45:15] Okay.
[00:45:18] So you then you joined the de-sag team on the ground.
[00:45:21] Yes.
[00:45:22] Did you charge the M30 again for good luck?
[00:45:25] No.
[00:45:26] At that time, we, I'll hit him 60.
[00:45:29] Okay.
[00:45:30] So you got the M60 off of it?
[00:45:32] Yeah.
[00:45:33] Yeah.
[00:45:34] So then what happened when you joined up with the de-sag team?
[00:45:37] The south team, because of the M60 and M18 was...
[00:45:42] All over the, the, the, the dish.
[00:45:46] And I, I wrapped one of them.
[00:45:50] No.
[00:45:51] At first I, yeah.
[00:45:53] I ended up one of them tried to shoot.
[00:45:56] And, who are the de-sag team from?
[00:45:59] But the, the, the Indian work, because they shoot,
[00:46:04] he shot all of them and the de-sag.
[00:46:08] They, uh, ran out of both.
[00:46:11] Yeah.
[00:46:13] Uh, I think they, uh, they're going to shoot the right.
[00:46:17] Oh, the gun was too dry.
[00:46:19] Yeah.
[00:46:20] I'll go to the shoot and then walk.
[00:46:21] Okay.
[00:46:22] So now you're in a perimeter, I guess, with your team, with the team.
[00:46:26] They're wounded.
[00:46:27] Yeah.
[00:46:28] And this is a wounded people who had picked that team.
[00:46:30] What team was this?
[00:46:31] I'm not sure.
[00:46:32] Sout a cartoon.
[00:46:33] This is before my time, even like, 67.
[00:46:36] I think.
[00:46:37] So I, I ran around and, uh, in five, and all the, uh,
[00:46:41] I'm, uh, 179 again.
[00:46:43] Mm-hmm.
[00:46:44] And 28-large.
[00:46:45] Two-baked, of the, and it, and it.
[00:46:47] So I just, okay.
[00:46:48] You should, may now, I'll be, uh, maybe, I did, maybe, maybe to you.
[00:46:51] I should, I should, I should, I should, I, I am the two-baked,
[00:46:55] I will, uh, am until the day.
[00:46:57] And, uh, I, uh, I should have been from 15 meters away from us to 200 meters away from us.
[00:47:06] Yeah, how long were you guys on the ground for before you got extracted?
[00:47:10] Oh.
[00:47:11] And, uh, when I, uh, after, after I started on a degree,
[00:47:16] I, uh, called the decovi.
[00:47:19] And, uh, he said, you still like, yeah, I still got that.
[00:47:23] And I called my rescue pilot because he, he's, he was on the sky.
[00:47:29] And he saw the, he said that he, he saw the, uh, the frame,
[00:47:33] the line of frame, the row, he, and hit my, uh, chopper and my chopper, I spoke,
[00:47:38] you know, the front row, I spoke and he thought that I was not that.
[00:47:43] But, like, he, he was not that, and he said, oh, you still like, I see him,
[00:47:49] but don't let it in the wall.
[00:47:51] We have to move.
[00:47:53] Yeah, so here, if that had been a U.E., they're dead.
[00:47:57] Everybody's dead, but that's a kingby.
[00:47:59] Yeah, the U.E. and the R.P.G.
[00:48:01] Hit the engine and blew it out, which is a nine cylinder World War Two engine
[00:48:05] from the B-17, but blew it out to aircraft, and he still,
[00:48:08] they will talk about it, walk away from it.
[00:48:11] Yeah, and crash land that thing.
[00:48:13] On the, on the sideways on the hill.
[00:48:15] Yeah.
[00:48:17] So, so was the, uh, the other aircraft, the other kingby then land and pick you guys up quickly
[00:48:23] or were you out there for a while?
[00:48:24] No, we have to, well, we have to run away from the,
[00:48:27] away from the L.Z. with the, with the team on 10 a.m. to HOP-M before I was bigger.
[00:48:35] So much for the two hour mission.
[00:48:37] Six hour six hour.
[00:48:39] And you're getting shot up by the NVA the whole time?
[00:48:43] Yeah, many times.
[00:48:44] And he's learning how to shoot the M79 in between the M16 and the M60,
[00:48:48] whatever around the has.
[00:48:50] On the job training in lay us.
[00:48:54] She's. So then you come back from that mission.
[00:48:58] And then take a shower, get ready, and go brief another mission.
[00:49:03] That's what you guys did.
[00:49:05] No, after having the mission that I was saw down,
[00:49:07] I went back to the, uh, Rob did back to Dr.
[00:49:12] And at that time, all of my commander, my squad, the man and the whole staff,
[00:49:16] I'll just go out and came down to Dr.
[00:49:19] To see what happened.
[00:49:21] And it couldn't believe you're still alive.
[00:49:24] And yeah.
[00:49:25] And when I first, when I first see my, my squad and go man,
[00:49:32] I said that my five need to have one week to,
[00:49:37] I'm big from a verification to relax.
[00:49:41] Did you give it to you?
[00:49:42] Yeah, he said, okay.
[00:49:44] So all you had to do is take a RPG hit, have your engine blown out,
[00:49:48] crash land and do a six hour gun fight with the NVA to get a week's vacation.
[00:49:53] I don't know. That seems like a rough tour.
[00:49:58] But the, the previous day, one of the job,
[00:50:02] I also got him by the RPG and the co-pilot, got killed.
[00:50:09] And the pilot and the, and the, and the mechanic and the delicious.
[00:50:17] I've burned, burned, burned, burned.
[00:50:20] I, I burned from the home.
[00:50:22] Yeah.
[00:50:23] Yeah.
[00:50:24] And then before the, the next day, before I left the housing,
[00:50:29] I went back to the,
[00:50:32] the last standing of the,
[00:50:34] the, the shop at the Wada,
[00:50:36] the, yes, of the, the previously and try to look for something.
[00:50:42] The, it's, it's, it's, it's got no remain of the co-pilot of the playlist day.
[00:50:48] But I couldn't find any.
[00:50:51] The whole thing was the,
[00:50:53] why us, because the,
[00:50:56] the, a club was the aluminum.
[00:50:58] Oh, so it just burned.
[00:51:00] It's just burned.
[00:51:02] Hmm.
[00:51:07] That, that wasn't your last time getting shot down.
[00:51:10] No, no, no, no.
[00:51:11] What about your tail row tail row getting shot off?
[00:51:16] Oh, tail row till the little cable.
[00:51:19] Um, it was in the house.
[00:51:23] And I was taken off.
[00:51:25] And suddenly I feel somebody hit my,
[00:51:30] on my, my food, on my feet.
[00:51:33] I've been, I've been.
[00:51:35] And I asked my,
[00:51:37] to bring it out, to thiswald,
[00:51:39] If you, you know,
[00:51:40] it came down the table.
[00:51:41] So there was a lot more than the peculiarity,
[00:51:43] certificates.
[00:51:44] Those line, guess what?
[00:51:46] What the,
[00:51:47] sum we Chaepp,
[00:51:47] whole finishes from here?
[00:51:50] Is certainly.
[00:51:51] Yeap Luke?
[00:51:52] Y 이거?
[00:51:53] The show.
[00:51:54] Saw, um,
[00:51:55] of this 질문.
[00:51:57] Well, we got to go in the room in the other去了
[00:51:59] because programming is the specialty solution,
[00:52:01] but in our table.
[00:52:02] Well, the coaching could be Andrew with the tower's house.
[00:52:05] But we had to calculate that.
[00:52:06] I did the job, but when I was taking it off,
[00:52:10] the job was done to turn right,
[00:52:13] because we don't have the control retail
[00:52:16] to remove the recycling to the left
[00:52:18] and reduce the power.
[00:52:20] And except I accept to be shot
[00:52:23] with other now, rather than grasslanding.
[00:52:28] So I did take it off, it was 60 knots
[00:52:32] and 560 knots, a little bit sideways.
[00:52:35] And it's like from the clouds,
[00:52:38] and I caught my...
[00:52:42] The arting me,
[00:52:45] who had landfills and big pay off
[00:52:47] or the extinct singles.
[00:52:51] Because I helped to make a grass,
[00:52:55] and I made a lot of big traffic
[00:53:00] and land, like a red and landing.
[00:53:03] And the tail wheel, that's down,
[00:53:06] I told my go-back,
[00:53:07] to the power.
[00:53:09] And he got off the power
[00:53:12] and he jumped the cell,
[00:53:14] slowly, slowly, he's head down,
[00:53:16] and he gets not running.
[00:53:19] He's a break,
[00:53:21] and he's back to to to to to to stop it,
[00:53:25] but it was not, but before,
[00:53:27] before I test that, I told my cruise ship,
[00:53:31] and I told him to tell the team,
[00:53:33] 9 or 9 of them in the shop,
[00:53:35] and tell the team,
[00:53:36] when I slow down, he's shocked.
[00:53:38] And tell them to jump out.
[00:53:40] The 9 man team.
[00:53:43] Tell them to not do that,
[00:53:44] not to remain,
[00:53:45] because we can make a class.
[00:53:48] And try to need the,
[00:53:51] to jump,
[00:53:53] to the right and stop.
[00:53:56] But I looked down,
[00:53:57] like, no, no, damn jump out.
[00:53:59] Is he still, is he jumping?
[00:54:02] Man.
[00:54:05] And any of the 9 members of the team get wounded,
[00:54:08] one guy was wounded?
[00:54:10] No, nobody's wounded.
[00:54:12] But yet they shot the rotor,
[00:54:14] they, they, they cable to the rotor.
[00:54:16] Yeah, that's crazy.
[00:54:17] And did the aircraft,
[00:54:18] between the weight,
[00:54:19] and the weight,
[00:54:20] he, just a recycling stick.
[00:54:21] Yeah.
[00:54:22] He flew back sideways and decreased the speed.
[00:54:24] I, I never heard that story.
[00:54:26] This is another one of those,
[00:54:28] oh my God, stories.
[00:54:29] Just another day flying kingby.
[00:54:31] We,
[00:54:32] we kept them on.
[00:54:34] Now you know why we say never one pilot.
[00:54:38] Man.
[00:54:40] I tell you one thing.
[00:54:43] Even at that time,
[00:54:45] we have the, uh,
[00:54:46] good chip.
[00:54:47] Yes.
[00:54:48] But to go for the house out,
[00:54:49] then we can make a lot of things.
[00:54:51] Is that right?
[00:54:52] Yeah.
[00:54:53] Because we,
[00:54:54] you know,
[00:54:55] you know,
[00:54:56] when you go out to this operation,
[00:54:58] the fueling and the thinking of the enemy,
[00:55:04] what they are not thinking.
[00:55:07] We can guess,
[00:55:09] but you know,
[00:55:10] you could guess what they are doing.
[00:55:12] What they are going to do.
[00:55:15] So you're saying that the American,
[00:55:17] the Americans,
[00:55:18] we would do random things.
[00:55:20] But the enemy,
[00:55:21] you kind of knew what they were going to do.
[00:55:23] They fall in patterns.
[00:55:24] We can guess most of them.
[00:55:26] Wow.
[00:55:27] The Americans just go out and receive a little ground fire somewhere.
[00:55:33] And they put the surprise it,
[00:55:35] try to surprise it.
[00:55:36] But for us,
[00:55:37] we can guess where they are going to put again.
[00:55:41] Or,
[00:55:42] or what they are going to plan.
[00:55:47] Because sometimes when,
[00:55:49] one time I was shot,
[00:55:52] I was taking up the Aussie and,
[00:55:55] I heard heavy, heavy ground fire from the high side.
[00:56:05] And I looked back and I saw the,
[00:56:07] and we,
[00:56:08] she did behind the 50-carbo.
[00:56:11] I sure they didn't make.
[00:56:13] Less than 100-year.
[00:56:15] And so I,
[00:56:18] I died out of the bamboo top.
[00:56:21] And back to the exact price.
[00:56:23] But the,
[00:56:25] I escaped,
[00:56:26] but the second king became mean and,
[00:56:29] they made it.
[00:56:31] Second,
[00:56:33] give me a shot down,
[00:56:35] shot down,
[00:56:36] cut fire.
[00:56:37] Wow.
[00:56:38] It's too close.
[00:56:40] Less than 100-year.
[00:56:42] I'm,
[00:56:43] another one,
[00:56:48] until it was telling me about,
[00:56:51] was,
[00:56:52] you,
[00:56:53] you got something hit.
[00:56:54] And you got hit by something.
[00:56:55] And it almost knocked you out of your seat.
[00:56:57] Yes.
[00:56:58] And there was a,
[00:56:59] like a two-inch hole in the back of the king.
[00:57:01] What was that?
[00:57:02] We couldn't find the foul.
[00:57:04] We couldn't find the idea around.
[00:57:06] And I don't,
[00:57:07] what kind of,
[00:57:09] what kind of,
[00:57:10] what kind of,
[00:57:11] what kind of,
[00:57:11] what kind of,
[00:57:12] what kind of,
[00:57:14] what kind of,
[00:57:15] what kind of,
[00:57:16] what kind of,
[00:57:17] what kind of,
[00:57:18] what kind of,
[00:57:19] what kind of,
[00:57:20] what kind of,
[00:57:21] maybe is just one or nothing but family know me for...
[00:57:23] that Day lights,
[00:57:25] and it's certainly,
[00:57:26] this direction.
[00:57:27] That somebody hit me with a hammer in the vacuum.
[00:57:29] That.
[00:57:29] like.
[00:57:29] just hit me for a,
[00:57:31] the get,
[00:57:31] He was like,
[00:57:32] it used,
[00:57:32] can't,
[00:57:34] can't let I go like,
[00:57:35] he simply?
[00:57:36] I thought,
[00:57:36] he did a.
[00:57:38] He did a,
[00:57:39] And he did it and will not,
[00:57:40] He did it.
[00:57:40] Alright,
[00:57:41] I used,
[00:57:42] and then I clean
[00:57:43] I
[00:57:42] team,
[00:57:44] He's glad I.
[00:57:46] I used,
[00:57:46] And when they got home, I checked the law and I saw the bike seat, the bike of my seat.
[00:57:56] The whole bit of this one.
[00:58:00] Yeah.
[00:58:02] And we're finally the one.
[00:58:04] Did you guys, was there any armored all on the Kingby?
[00:58:07] No.
[00:58:08] No armor, just aluminum.
[00:58:10] I don't mean them.
[00:58:11] Can't stop anything.
[00:58:13] I said, oh, yeah, one dead as a one.
[00:58:16] I'm afraid.
[00:58:17] You need to answer the answer.
[00:58:19] Under the answer.
[00:58:20] Yeah, an armor plate.
[00:58:21] Oh, to be honest.
[00:58:22] Maybe 18 inches wide.
[00:58:24] We wrap up on the sides under the easy engine.
[00:58:28] Best about the only armor I'm aware of.
[00:58:30] Yeah.
[00:58:31] Yeah.
[00:58:32] Would you wear?
[00:58:33] Did you wear a flack vest or anything?
[00:58:35] No.
[00:58:36] No point.
[00:58:37] No.
[00:58:38] They're able to cool Kingby flight.
[00:58:42] Just a flight suit.
[00:58:43] Overalls.
[00:58:44] Have their Kingby Siggins on them and they have their holster on their hip like a cowboy.
[00:58:52] They're really good looking uniforms.
[00:58:56] I like the black was best.
[00:58:59] How many operations do you think you flew?
[00:59:03] This guy could eat.
[00:59:05] I got four thousand hours.
[00:59:08] And minus one thousand hours for Ryzen or in the other.
[00:59:14] Other thing.
[00:59:16] So three thousand.
[00:59:18] Two thousand.
[00:59:19] Two thousand.
[00:59:20] Two thousand.
[00:59:22] For each mission.
[00:59:24] So 1500 or so missions.
[00:59:26] Yeah, keep it.
[00:59:27] Keep it.
[00:59:28] Keep it.
[00:59:29] These are all song missions.
[00:59:32] Yeah.
[00:59:33] How often, how often would you have any contact on the ground when you were
[00:59:38] in?
[00:59:39] Usually they.
[00:59:46] When I came in to introduce the team and I saw something.
[00:59:57] One decision.
[00:59:58] Like one time when I went to the airs.
[01:00:03] And I saw the telephone line on the airs.
[01:00:07] And the team was getting off.
[01:00:10] I came back to back.
[01:00:13] And they came back to the one time that I saw it.
[01:00:17] And I bought the bike right away.
[01:00:20] But most of the time when we got shot when we take off from the airs.
[01:00:26] When the team would say it's for the extraction.
[01:00:29] Yeah, for the extraction.
[01:00:30] Yeah.
[01:00:31] So most of the time you could get in.
[01:00:33] Well, you were just pulled the team out almost immediately.
[01:00:36] If you guys took a good time.
[01:00:37] Yeah, if we were compromised and we just try to get it back.
[01:00:40] Go out.
[01:00:41] If we could.
[01:00:42] We're percentage.
[01:00:43] You think you guys were compromised on the insert.
[01:00:45] Probably a lot more than we realized.
[01:00:47] Mm-hmm.
[01:00:48] Could they have had the LC watchers.
[01:00:50] And they would like to get us on the ground first.
[01:00:53] Particularly by the end of 68.
[01:00:55] Could they had the, uh, saw 100 killer teams that were out there.
[01:00:59] They're main mission was to find us.
[01:01:01] Yeah.
[01:01:02] I would think they would want to wait to you inserted.
[01:01:04] Right.
[01:01:05] Let's see you insert.
[01:01:06] Let the helicopter leave and then roll you up.
[01:01:09] There we go.
[01:01:10] So the insert usually would go well on less there days.
[01:01:15] Like we had that time in November where we could get shot out the primary secondary and the
[01:01:20] alternate.
[01:01:21] And the kingbies would go in.
[01:01:22] Bing, Bing, Bing.
[01:01:23] Go have lunch.
[01:01:24] They would refuel have a little lunch.
[01:01:26] There's another target.
[01:01:27] Go back and do it again.
[01:01:29] And often they would come back with bullholes.
[01:01:31] Could we, uh, Lily got shot out there.
[01:01:34] Does any of me activity here?
[01:01:35] We wouldn't go.
[01:01:36] You know, you're compromised.
[01:01:37] You want to try to get them to ground and get going with the mission.
[01:01:41] And we had several days like that back to back to back in the king.
[01:01:44] He's got beat up.
[01:01:46] But fortunately, nothing was got shot down.
[01:01:50] And the Sikorsky's just a beat.
[01:01:52] That's just a, that's just a horse of a aircraft.
[01:01:55] Yeah.
[01:01:56] Only had one door, but it had the windows.
[01:01:58] So whenever we're distracted, our,
[01:02:00] the first man in the chop would go to the, to the, uh, left window.
[01:02:04] You mean the port side?
[01:02:05] Port.
[01:02:06] That's why man.
[01:02:07] How we get the port confusing start.
[01:02:10] Unless I'm drinking port.
[01:02:11] And that's not me man, right there.
[01:02:14] And the left side.
[01:02:15] Yes.
[01:02:16] Is the bull kid secure?
[01:02:18] The bull kid is secure.
[01:02:19] There you go.
[01:02:20] You're all, baby.
[01:02:21] And then right here, we can interject.
[01:02:25] Um,
[01:02:29] sometimes they would be in the air.
[01:02:32] And there would be an emergency call for any helicopter,
[01:02:36] which he did in August of 1969.
[01:02:39] I forget what you were on, but this is that mission with Scarface.
[01:02:44] Mm-hmm.
[01:02:45] And Scarface was making a gun run.
[01:02:48] And they were working conjunction with the, uh,
[01:02:51] the hunter first airborne on their air mobile units.
[01:02:55] Mm-hmm.
[01:02:56] And there was, uh, like a river stream, and they were making a gun run.
[01:03:01] So the hunter first had gone down with the coba.
[01:03:03] They had coba then.
[01:03:05] Scarface came in with a regular gun ship.
[01:03:07] Got hit.
[01:03:08] As it went down, it flipped over to the door to crew members came out.
[01:03:13] It crashed upside down.
[01:03:15] They put out an emergency call on was there.
[01:03:19] He response to the call.
[01:03:21] The gunships went down.
[01:03:23] And they made a gun run on each side of the down upside down Scarface.
[01:03:29] He followed right in.
[01:03:31] And he picked up the two two crew members.
[01:03:36] He picked up with either the,
[01:03:38] No, I didn't pick up the air.
[01:03:39] Just spot them.
[01:03:40] You spot them first?
[01:03:41] Because I, uh, I, I flew along the stream to see what the, uh,
[01:03:46] I, I, I, I identified the people.
[01:03:50] And I spot two of them standing on the big ground about this, this table.
[01:03:55] And I called them like I'm now.
[01:03:58] And they, I keep, so they, they came down to pick them up.
[01:04:02] And I keep, I'd down the, uh, stream to look for other people.
[01:04:07] And I couldn't find any more.
[01:04:09] I come back.
[01:04:10] I came back to the, uh, to the down here with the subside down.
[01:04:16] And I couldn't see anyone, I couldn't see inside the cabin or our cockpit.
[01:04:21] So I used my ride wheel to turn it back.
[01:04:26] Hmm.
[01:04:27] You flipped over the he way.
[01:04:28] Well, under enemy fire.
[01:04:30] And I checked the entire, I just don't know what he's in there.
[01:04:34] So I thought I, I couldn't find any more.
[01:04:37] Then you have your crew chief hang out the door.
[01:04:39] Yeah.
[01:04:40] And then he was able to say that he saw people in the pile of the copouts.
[01:04:43] Uh, because this day, there's two, those are the two, uh, only two scar face marines,
[01:04:50] aviators that are still listed as MIA.
[01:04:53] Oh, that's true.
[01:04:54] I think it was the pilot and, and the crew chief, because the copilot got out.
[01:04:58] And they were able to rescue those two.
[01:05:01] And, uh, and the bubble of the front of the U.E.
[01:05:05] Where he put his, you know, the strut,
[01:05:07] and put the wheel in and lifted up the helicopter.
[01:05:10] And the crew chief goes and hangs out all while under enemy fire.
[01:05:14] So in August 2000, scar face honored on at a banquet in San Diego,
[01:05:22] to thank him for the heroic mission.
[01:05:24] And they helped get your award for the mission to correct.
[01:05:28] Was that part of that?
[01:05:29] Hmm, no yet.
[01:05:30] Not yet.
[01:05:31] But that was one mission where he was just flying.
[01:05:34] And they had to call for help.
[01:05:36] He responded to help scar face.
[01:05:38] Because scar face and the hundred first that protected Kingby's all the time.
[01:05:42] And you got shot up on that one, too.
[01:05:44] It wasn't like we're just another day in the park.
[01:05:47] He's helping the marines try to find those aviators.
[01:05:50] And I'm not sure how many hits he got.
[01:05:52] But just the fact that go down the stream,
[01:05:55] put the strut underneath the front nose had been knocked out and lifted up
[01:05:59] to give them a status report.
[01:06:02] Hmm.
[01:06:03] Just another day with the Kingby's.
[01:06:05] Hmm.
[01:06:06] Amazing.
[01:06:07] Yeah, that, you know, the reputation you guys had must have been just.
[01:06:13] I mean, that opening that I read from this,
[01:06:16] like it's just epic, you know,
[01:06:18] to hear the relief from Watkins,
[01:06:22] who hears who it is, like, okay, now we got a chance.
[01:06:25] Yeah.
[01:06:26] And that was always our golden moment.
[01:06:30] We were on a ground, you're in a firefight,
[01:06:32] and they say the Kingby's are coming.
[01:06:34] It's like, thank God for the Kingby's.
[01:06:37] On that mission, when you decide, hey, you know what?
[01:06:41] I'm not going to bring a co-pilot.
[01:06:43] I'm not going to bring a coup-cheaf.
[01:06:44] I'm just going to bring me and the gunner.
[01:06:47] That's it.
[01:06:48] That seems like that seems like a kind of crazy decision to make.
[01:06:53] Because we, with my wife, I know that the situation was too bad.
[01:06:58] And we have to go out to as fast as we can.
[01:07:02] So we can't bring them home.
[01:07:05] As fast as you can, meaning it would have taken time
[01:07:08] to round up the copilot?
[01:07:10] No.
[01:07:11] If one time when we was, they were put in a motor in a nettle.
[01:07:20] And I saw the, the, the, the, the, the, the,
[01:07:26] it's moke came out from the gun on the other side of the hill.
[01:07:30] And I saw, I, I ran to the my job and the climb up and couldn't get up.
[01:07:37] And when I was taking off, the group of copilot was late.
[01:07:41] And he just cried.
[01:07:43] So you didn't care if you had a copilot or not?
[01:07:46] No, I didn't.
[01:07:47] What was just like that mission later in the book with a chapter 20 when they had the night bright light.
[01:07:56] Yeah.
[01:07:57] Where the hatchet force had been in.
[01:07:59] They had severe casualties.
[01:08:01] They had all been expiltrated out.
[01:08:04] The last helicopter went in was again, you went in on strings to pick up the team leader from the hatchet force.
[01:08:11] They had a sergeant estate back in the couple indigenous troops.
[01:08:14] And the chopper got shot down the crest.
[01:08:18] And then that night they asked to go in and this is October 69.
[01:08:23] And limb black went in and on took them out.
[01:08:28] Again, with no crew.
[01:08:30] They took them out at night.
[01:08:32] Found the LZ.
[01:08:33] They thought they thought they were going to have to repell in.
[01:08:35] But somehow he's able to find an area big enough to get the king be in and went down.
[01:08:40] Lim black got in.
[01:08:41] Picked up the picked up the team member had a broken back.
[01:08:45] And the other survivors.
[01:08:47] And then he came back again at night.
[01:08:50] Picked up the team.
[01:08:51] I think this time they had the pull him out and strings.
[01:08:54] And then they pulled them out.
[01:08:56] Was there anyone else that could fly at night like you could?
[01:09:00] Yes, I'm moving.
[01:09:02] Was it your eyesight?
[01:09:04] Was it just the amount of hours that you had in the helicopter?
[01:09:07] Oh, you know, I can see.
[01:09:10] You know at that time they think they really have the sea model.
[01:09:21] We got from the army.
[01:09:26] We have the ADF, VHS and FM.
[01:09:28] But the D-Morrow.
[01:09:30] We got from the Marine.
[01:09:33] We have detected VHS, VHS, FM.
[01:09:40] But since the Titan and the VHS, we don't use the alphabet.
[01:09:48] We almost never use it. And it's too heavy.
[01:09:51] And it started in the tail boom.
[01:09:54] And it might cause each other heavy.
[01:09:56] Tell you what heavy.
[01:09:58] So I removed all of them.
[01:10:00] You said it was extra radios out.
[01:10:02] Yeah.
[01:10:03] We only needed the EWSF and the FM.
[01:10:09] That's all.
[01:10:10] And this leads me to a quick side bar.
[01:10:13] I don't know if this is you or not, but we had 68.
[01:10:18] The Kingbees had the Marines.
[01:10:20] One of them thraced the Kingbees to Fubai.
[01:10:23] So they had, I mean, just the race.
[01:10:25] A race, race.
[01:10:26] They had their own feet.
[01:10:27] This is just going from Denang, from the Air Base.
[01:10:30] And the Kingbees go, we'll race you to Fubai.
[01:10:32] So Kingbees versus what?
[01:10:34] The first is the Marine Corps, H34s.
[01:10:36] They still have some H34s.
[01:10:38] Oh, so it's just Kingbee versus Kingbee.
[01:10:40] Yeah.
[01:10:41] But Kingbee versus Marine Corps.
[01:10:42] They've got it with all the radios.
[01:10:44] So the Marines had to go around high-van pass and go over to South China Sea.
[01:10:49] Kingbees fly up and over.
[01:10:51] Kingbees.
[01:10:52] They get the Fubai win $100.
[01:10:54] I hope that was your job.
[01:10:57] That was one of our favorite Kingbees stories.
[01:10:59] The freshman always told that one.
[01:11:02] Man.
[01:11:04] And then who's your maintenance crews?
[01:11:07] Oh, yeah.
[01:11:08] Was it Vietnamese?
[01:11:09] Yes.
[01:11:10] Air Force.
[01:11:11] They were in the Air Base.
[01:11:13] They were in the military circles.
[01:11:15] And later on, we got the...
[01:11:21] Let's see.
[01:11:22] What was that?
[01:11:23] I said the Air Force.
[01:11:24] Again, L-O-O-O-D.
[01:11:27] This is American company.
[01:11:31] American company.
[01:11:33] Yeah.
[01:11:34] The main job is to refresh the park.
[01:11:40] I suppose to change the tail rotor.
[01:11:45] They make the whole set and put it up.
[01:11:49] This is a change in the whole set.
[01:11:52] But I don't trust them.
[01:11:55] You know why?
[01:11:57] Because one time after the change the tail rotor.
[01:12:05] And after I checked everything,
[01:12:10] I served to Kaya for the shopping kind of the engine.
[01:12:14] And the shopping kind of happened now.
[01:12:18] Up and down.
[01:12:19] And I just picked up the needle and cut off the engine.
[01:12:24] And the shopping was the craziest.
[01:12:26] I made it.
[01:12:27] It's stuck in the nose come up.
[01:12:29] And I go down and check.
[01:12:32] I checked and checked the tail.
[01:12:35] Oh my god.
[01:12:36] Why is it only one more other three breaks?
[01:12:38] And I remained.
[01:12:40] He's supposed to have a fault break.
[01:12:43] Oh, I don't have a break.
[01:12:44] One was not there.
[01:12:46] Until Roo was MIA.
[01:12:49] I got a wrong one.
[01:12:51] I got a wrong one.
[01:12:52] I got a wrong one.
[01:12:53] Yeah, we had an in Vietnam for the seals in Vietnam.
[01:12:58] They had a similar relationship
[01:13:00] that the saw guys had with the Kimbees with the sea wolves.
[01:13:05] And they had to kind of improvise.
[01:13:09] Improvise.
[01:13:10] And their maintenance, they were very proud of their maintenance crews.
[01:13:14] Because their maintenance crews would keep those aircraft running.
[01:13:17] And they would do whatever they had to do.
[01:13:19] And Rob cheating steel to keep the aircraft running.
[01:13:22] They were all ready.
[01:13:25] You know, use birds that had,
[01:13:27] forget they scrimmed up the aircraft themselves from somewhere.
[01:13:30] They're kind of left over aircraft.
[01:13:32] And so that it wasn't just the pilots and the gunners.
[01:13:36] And then on top of that, these incredibly hard work and sailors in the Navy that were making those birds able to fly on a moment's notice.
[01:13:43] Absolutely.
[01:13:44] But it's a very similar relationship for the saw guys and the Kingbee pilots as it is for the seals and the sea wolf guys.
[01:13:53] Oh, they're of legend.
[01:13:54] Absolutely.
[01:13:55] Yeah.
[01:13:56] And just the similar, you know, the attitude, you know what you said,
[01:13:59] Con, or on earlier when I asked you, you know, what, what do you think about when you need to go back into a spot where two Kingbees have already shot down.
[01:14:13] It then shot down.
[01:14:14] And your response was I want to get my friends out.
[01:14:17] That's it.
[01:14:18] That's, that's the a spree to core that is just unmatched, you know, and having that relationship with.
[01:14:24] And just that that warrior brotherhood is.
[01:14:30] So there's a very human side like there's a few times that we could pull that right at last light.
[01:14:36] We go to the Kingbee pilots say, hey, come on, I'll buy you a drink and captain 10 and say, I'm going home to my family or captain two on.
[01:14:44] No, thank you, but I'm going to go home.
[01:14:46] I'll be back tomorrow.
[01:14:47] You buy me drinks tomorrow.
[01:14:49] And they come back and he had time and couldn't clubhouse have a drink before we go on an exc mission.
[01:14:54] There's just amazing.
[01:14:55] So you had this whole, yeah, that's crazy.
[01:14:58] That dichotomy.
[01:14:59] Yeah.
[01:14:59] There with their, to fly home to her family.
[01:15:02] She's.
[01:15:03] And they always came for us.
[01:15:04] They never, you know, we never had them say no for us.
[01:15:07] And they have our teams.
[01:15:09] Yeah, I know that's that's definitely something to think about because Americans, we are always fighting in someone else's country.
[01:15:16] Right?
[01:15:17] We can go home.
[01:15:18] We can go home to employment.
[01:15:19] That's it.
[01:15:20] You know, there's no family.
[01:15:21] What were you married during this time or were you, did you have kids during this time?
[01:15:26] Did you have your, your brother?
[01:15:27] Yeah, I, I'm out, I'm out in, uh, 1969.
[01:15:33] And I don't remember what, if I was a set down before it or the after it.
[01:15:42] I don't remember.
[01:15:43] I said, I said the last time.
[01:15:45] I was like, let me, let me.
[01:15:49] And you must remember, uh, you know, going on a mission, getting your aircraft shot up and then going home to your wife and saying, hi, honey, I'm home.
[01:15:55] Yeah.
[01:15:56] Mm.
[01:15:57] Yeah.
[01:15:58] Every time I, the, I was shot.
[01:16:03] But they, they, they, they, I think most of the, like many times they miss me.
[01:16:12] Yeah.
[01:16:16] One time, I feel back from, uh, hair side, back to Kwang Shih.
[01:16:19] And, uh, where was the very back?
[01:16:22] And we flew all, all, all about three in the team along the hillside.
[01:16:30] And, suddenly, this, this, this, somebody, a, a long line of, I kind of, I kind of like it.
[01:16:39] Right, right, all, all of, all of my, my year.
[01:16:43] And I, I look, I look up, I look up hill.
[01:16:47] And I saw, the, a lot of NVA, you know, in the Shivua.
[01:16:55] Mm.
[01:16:56] Yeah.
[01:16:57] The front lines, the sheet, the second line, the knee and the third line, the stand.
[01:17:03] Just like that.
[01:17:04] And they were on the hill.
[01:17:06] And they're shooting at me.
[01:17:08] Wow.
[01:17:09] And, uh, and I, I, I told my Kusi.
[01:17:14] Shoot the back shoot back shoot like that.
[01:17:17] And I saw the, uh, trigger out, you know, the, you know, the round, the, the, the, the whole,
[01:17:23] the, the, the, uh, in front of the front line of them.
[01:17:27] I don't know, if they, if they, they hit the,
[01:17:30] I know them or not.
[01:17:31] But because I was the last one in the fry and then time.
[01:17:35] And so I just get primed, wait to pointy, and wait to pointy, I count, I found 49 holes.
[01:17:46] He's flying from K-Son where we had F-LB-3 who had pick-up teams on launch for targets from
[01:17:51] K-Son.
[01:17:52] And of course when you flew in the K-Son, this is during the offensive.
[01:17:57] So you know that was it.
[01:17:58] So he flies from that hot zone flying to Kwong Tree, which is, quote, a secure base in
[01:18:04] route, there's three lines of VNVA just practicing target, hit them 49 times.
[01:18:11] Yeah, 49 rounds.
[01:18:17] What happened the last time you got shot down?
[01:18:21] The last time because shot down was in Budapest, north of Banyatwai.
[01:18:33] And I, in so-so team at K-Son, when I K-Son, when you're in service for a long time,
[01:18:48] in K-Son, you have some feeling.
[01:18:51] I go to say six feeling.
[01:18:55] And I feel something wrong on the ground.
[01:18:58] Yeah, now in the original example, so I'm from 1500 feet, I go down to check it.
[01:19:05] I had about 500 feet, they sat the suit at me.
[01:19:11] And this is this when you're trying to extract them or is this during the insert?
[01:19:15] I'm not going to fall.
[01:19:16] He's coming back from.
[01:19:18] Okay, so after you drop them off, you're halfway home and you decide you're going to go look
[01:19:22] on the ground.
[01:19:23] Yeah.
[01:19:24] And you start getting shot.
[01:19:25] Yeah.
[01:19:26] And I got mad.
[01:19:30] I said, I'm going to extract fire and I skipped the line of fire.
[01:19:36] And I said, man, I said, this is my land and I take care of all of my
[01:19:43] you could get your dad to suit and me.
[01:19:45] So I come back and suit and I got hit again and the shot for cut fire.
[01:19:53] They're around hit the fuel tank and then the fuel ignites.
[01:19:58] And the fire comes from the fuel tank into the cabin.
[01:20:02] He's at 500 feet trying to keep the air,
[01:20:06] create a stable to land while on fire.
[01:20:12] And I was on top of the frame.
[01:20:15] The frames come from the camera from the cabin to the cockpit.
[01:20:20] And if I land right or right or the subway around there,
[01:20:30] it would be okay, but I don't want it to be a cut.
[01:20:37] So I could find it like a two-wheel.
[01:20:40] So your planes on your helicopter is on fire.
[01:20:44] You could cry.
[01:20:45] You could land.
[01:20:46] But you don't want to get caught.
[01:20:49] No.
[01:20:50] Because that's going to be hard.
[01:20:52] And I tried to get back to Buddha and the frame took the frame keep burning.
[01:21:01] And one time it was so hot that I left all of the control.
[01:21:11] It's quite a good and cycle.
[01:21:13] I left it.
[01:21:14] I keep my hand in my chest.
[01:21:18] When I left the cycle,
[01:21:22] then the job started to dive down.
[01:21:26] And I saw the round coming up.
[01:21:31] And I just tell the thing in my head,
[01:21:36] and his arm is over.
[01:21:39] But when it comes close to the three-top,
[01:21:43] the instinct of survival,
[01:21:48] pushed me to grab the cycle and pull back.
[01:21:52] And the job was diving down.
[01:21:55] And it's just literally when I pulled the cycle back so hard.
[01:21:59] And it came up.
[01:22:01] I thought that the men wrote the wood to mouth, but he needed.
[01:22:05] And I saw it.
[01:22:07] And I left it.
[01:22:09] And the job was diving again.
[01:22:12] So it's like a scene line in this guy.
[01:22:20] And finally I make a glass landing in the open area.
[01:22:28] So the handles were so hot that you couldn't hold onto them.
[01:22:34] But then at the last minute, survival instinct,
[01:22:38] you knew what you had to do in order to get some kind of a landing.
[01:22:41] So you just grabbed those.
[01:22:44] And when I saw the LZ,
[01:22:47] I was flying at the 80, 80, not a combine.
[01:22:51] And it was 90, not a combine.
[01:22:55] And I moved this cycle to the right,
[01:22:59] and pushed the right pedal all the way down.
[01:23:03] And so the job at the 90, not a combine.
[01:23:08] But 360 degree.
[01:23:11] So quick, I thought the key, the tail boom came off.
[01:23:15] But he didn't.
[01:23:16] And it started to sail around.
[01:23:18] And I touched it down very smooth.
[01:23:21] And it still runs as still running.
[01:23:25] So he did three and on the wheel came off.
[01:23:28] And the blade came off.
[01:23:31] And when he stole, I grabbed the seatbelt lock.
[01:23:37] And I pulled it.
[01:23:40] But in September, I kept pulling.
[01:23:43] My finger opened it.
[01:23:46] And for three times, I used my left hand.
[01:23:49] I left elbow to hit the buckle.
[01:23:52] And the legs, the lock.
[01:23:56] And I grabbed the handle of the window.
[01:23:59] Because when I make the cross, it ran.
[01:24:02] And the window ran forward.
[01:24:05] And then forward, move forward and close it.
[01:24:08] So I grabbed the handle of the window.
[01:24:11] Pull it back.
[01:24:12] But it happened.
[01:24:13] I liked it.
[01:24:14] I just sit down.
[01:24:15] I grabbed it.
[01:24:16] But the finger opened.
[01:24:17] But couldn't hold the handle.
[01:24:20] Because the skin was burning.
[01:24:22] So I used my shoulder to hit the window.
[01:24:27] And abruptly, the window out.
[01:24:29] I just went down.
[01:24:31] And so from the down, the arm of the material was came off.
[01:24:37] Or was burned out.
[01:24:39] I sat the zipper.
[01:24:41] And the little part was still burning.
[01:24:45] And when I rolled down on the grass, the wet grass.
[01:24:49] And to put it off.
[01:24:52] And after it was off, I couldn't stand up.
[01:24:58] And my crew chips ran by and grabbed me up.
[01:25:03] And then we did the guide me to the rescue shop.
[01:25:07] You know, my three, number three came there.
[01:25:11] So then you get on the number three kingby.
[01:25:14] They get you out of there.
[01:25:16] And obviously you go straight to the hospital.
[01:25:19] They brought me back to the medical area of the cop in the hospital.
[01:25:25] And I stayed there until 11 am to next morning.
[01:25:40] One kingby pilot, one kingby pilot from Denny,
[01:25:46] three of me, with the omega-nabrize, abruptly to a third few years ago.
[01:25:56] And that's where I stayed for eight months.
[01:26:01] And what was that process like those next eight months?
[01:26:05] Oh, they, uh, amputating my hand and making sheets of thin clay on my life.
[01:26:13] Because my life, uh, when I was in the hospital.
[01:26:17] And the day the doctor, doctor Smith, he amputated my hand.
[01:26:25] I asked him how about my life.
[01:26:28] He said that he didn't know until after the, after the operation.
[01:26:35] Did they amputate both your hands at the same time?
[01:26:38] Yes.
[01:26:42] And then what was the, what was the plan from there?
[01:26:46] What happened after that?
[01:26:48] After that I do back and four or three, before eight months.
[01:26:53] No, the treatment, the medical treatment, about four or five months.
[01:26:57] But after that I do make the form of two years with two years.
[01:27:01] For the doctor to check it.
[01:27:04] And after that, after all the treatment, the surgery back to the, with Luis Hospital.
[01:27:14] And at some point, I know you had a brother that was a, a, he won pilot, right?
[01:27:19] He's, a, he won pilot.
[01:27:21] And what happened with him?
[01:27:23] He was on the, uh, a nine to five months.
[01:27:27] And it was missing.
[01:27:30] Yes, all right, we know.
[01:27:32] And 95 misses were across the fence also, right?
[01:27:35] No.
[01:27:36] No.
[01:27:37] He was missing about about 30 kilometers north of, uh, not what they need.
[01:27:45] Ten, both in ten.
[01:27:49] And then what was it like when the, when the war started to kind of wind down for, you know,
[01:27:55] America leaving and the communist are going to take over.
[01:27:58] What was that, what was that like for you?
[01:28:01] Um, um, at the end of, uh, of April, April, April, 1995.
[01:28:17] Yeah.
[01:28:18] One was going to came to a pilot team to say to see me and, he, he, he was my, co-fi.
[01:28:25] This is an April of 1995.
[01:28:27] Oh, 1975.
[01:28:32] Oh, 1975.
[01:28:33] Okay.
[01:28:34] Yeah.
[01:28:35] Got it.
[01:28:35] And, uh, he asked me, uh, what we are going to do?
[01:28:40] And I say, I really don't know what to do now.
[01:28:43] Is everything myself?
[01:28:45] Did you, I mean, obviously, did you feel like the, when the communist took over that you were just
[01:28:53] doomed because clearly you were a veteran that had fought for South Vietnam.
[01:28:59] It seems like you, you, you, you must have felt like you would be doomed if they
[01:29:04] completed the take over a Vietnam.
[01:29:07] No, I don't say so.
[01:29:09] No.
[01:29:12] The, uh, the thing is that we, we were a desperate, because we lost the war.
[01:29:18] There's nothing.
[01:29:25] And, uh, on the, uh, let's see, 30, uh, April, 30, 1975.
[01:29:38] I was on board over one of the ship.
[01:29:40] I still remember the, uh, the sea challenges.
[01:29:46] And, uh, when I heard the, uh, it was off, uh, of Wukongtong.
[01:29:51] So you were on an American ship?
[01:29:53] I don't know which is.
[01:29:55] The ship is in the country.
[01:29:56] Yeah, sea challenges.
[01:29:58] And, uh, when I heard the, uh, announcement of a surrender from Zeno Loming,
[01:30:05] oh, my, uh, my tears just came out.
[01:30:10] And I want to do them over the war.
[01:30:15] And, uh, when I look back and I see my toolkit, and he's told me.
[01:30:22] He's told me from the B.L.
[01:30:27] So then what happened?
[01:30:28] I mean, now you've got your two kids, your, your, your,
[01:30:31] In Vietnam, the South is surrendered.
[01:30:34] What, what, what happened then?
[01:30:37] And we go back to, uh, go back home and then wait for what happened.
[01:30:45] And, um, in, uh,
[01:30:51] Surah, yeah, Surah is six.
[01:30:55] I, I, I, I, I, 75.
[01:30:58] I was in, uh, yeah, they put me in the, uh, radio station camp.
[01:31:03] In a re-education camp.
[01:31:05] Yeah.
[01:31:07] What was that experience like?
[01:31:09] Yes.
[01:31:11] This is just talked about, uh,
[01:31:15] propaganda, uh, propaganda, uh,
[01:31:19] and the thing is that the people who, they, they,
[01:31:24] they want to, they want us to go to class every day.
[01:31:28] And we have to go to class every day as they skip talk,
[01:31:31] but they guy who tell a total, total,
[01:31:35] this is the level of normalized.
[01:31:40] Oh, my God.
[01:31:42] This is likely, maybe, well, the class is already great to me.
[01:31:47] So you're being re-educated by a third grade.
[01:31:50] Yeah, right.
[01:31:51] And they keep, and all of them talking the same way.
[01:31:55] Mm-hmm.
[01:31:56] This is like the machine.
[01:31:57] It's just indoctrination.
[01:31:59] Yeah, indoctrination.
[01:32:00] Yeah.
[01:32:01] How long did, and how long were you at the re-education camp for?
[01:32:04] I was there for, um, uh,
[01:32:06] zoolite, I don't know, from, uh, zool, to, uh, August.
[01:32:11] And then how did you get out of the re-education camp?
[01:32:13] Well, one time I was, uh, doing out with my, uh,
[01:32:17] the other prisoners to, uh, create up as a, uh, the camp.
[01:32:22] And I was pulling the, uh, bubble-wide with them.
[01:32:27] And, uh, one of the, uh, one of the guys they, uh,
[01:32:32] at the, uh, and they told me that, uh,
[01:32:34] you keep, uh, um, okay.
[01:32:35] And we have the inspection team, um, from Saigon to Camsey.
[01:32:40] Hm-hmm.
[01:32:41] Mm-hmm.
[01:32:42] And, uh, when I, I saw that, uh, I hear that.
[01:32:46] I, I don't know, I, I don't know.
[01:32:48] I don't know, I don't, I don't, I, I didn't, uh,
[01:32:51] pull the bubble, why, I didn't know.
[01:32:53] I just came over, armed with my fire.

[01:43:07] money to your mom she didn't send money she sent medicine medicine and I sell it I
[01:43:15] said okay you were not having this there's no no medicine you get down and during that time
[01:43:21] to your father was killed right my final lie in 63 63 63
[01:43:29] okay sorry yeah I was I was the F was the day you joined the Air Force yeah but
[01:43:35] you're by the way my father that my father was away that day
[01:43:42] so how did you finally how did you finally get out of Vietnam and get to America
[01:43:46] oh I see in 88 then I heard that the H.O. program I'm not a qualified project
[01:44:00] that program you say H.O. H.O. yeah humanitarian organization currently passed in
[01:44:06] yeah and it's it's helping the people who was in who was in service or who was in prison
[01:44:14] in the company's prison for one and two years can come up I'd like to come here
[01:44:22] and how did you not qualify for that because at the total time I spent
[01:44:28] prison it's only two and half year well see need to dispense more time and
[01:44:32] prison you can you imagine that after all the service could have been
[01:44:37] and so I thought that maybe I would have I might be living Vietnam forever
[01:44:46] so I prepare for my what I'm I plan to what I'm going to do to lead
[01:44:56] but at that time the
[01:45:00] side of it means the
[01:45:06] first association is the
[01:45:09] the mayor of Masuoka he was the
[01:45:15] Air Force reticulano so this is an American Air Force retired in Masuoka
[01:45:20] and he was working with the San Jose
[01:45:23] he's now Vietnamese Air Force Association yeah and he the
[01:45:32] South Vietnamese Air Force Association asked me to help me I seem to help me and
[01:45:41] he went to Vietnam and South Vietnam and I he asked me to bring on my paper that I had
[01:45:48] I brought to him and when he saw the DFC and he said
[01:45:56] when he saw the what the DFC no the FC this thing was right close
[01:46:01] what's that American award all the DSC got it got it got it
[01:46:06] or the DSF foreign cars got it okay yeah yeah I know I got it I I misunderstood
[01:46:11] okay so he saw that he saw that and but he didn't say anything but later on he said that
[01:46:16] he told me that he didn't believe it because usually the DFC supposed to give
[01:46:23] to a baby award to the American college so after he looked all kind of
[01:46:29] a on my paper and he said that he would try and represent but he's not guaranteed
[01:46:36] under percent
[01:46:38] and he came back to state and he called one of the guy who worked in the
[01:46:51] archive, National Archives and the that guy was he was working with him in the military
[01:47:01] when he was cornered and the guy was then second lit
[01:47:07] down on the corner second lit in the corner okay like a lieutenant corner yeah a little
[01:47:15] the corner and so I had and they found the DFC and the FC and the FR are the
[01:47:26] writer and the paper and that the FC and they managed to
[01:47:38] the National Inquiry the magazine was quite bad yeah they they found the
[01:47:50] before I did I I escaped okay and one pilot came to see me
[01:48:00] he's a so-liner and he's a squad commander he's a molyson and they came
[01:48:10] the National Inquiry but they everything that they took the camera to all year to see me
[01:48:16] wow and so then they set up that program to get you back here so what year did you finally get back
[01:48:25] or what did you get to America? let's see I came here in 1994 1994 yeah
[01:48:31] right in Nashville what family did you leave back in Vietnam? when I left Vietnam my mom still
[01:48:39] I told my nephew the descendant of my my missing more brother to take care of to come over
[01:48:52] I leave it so I can go and I came here in I left Vietnam
[01:49:00] on January 10, 1994 and I came at least 12 years here to on then in 2015, 1994 and then
[01:49:17] what happened? did you have any family here did you know anybody?
[01:49:21] no I first I leave the same house with the the chip of the the south of the video for such a season
[01:49:30] there okay yeah I leave it for six months after that I moved out and then did you get a job? what did you
[01:49:40] do? no yeah at that time my my my my son and my brother and my son and my daughter work
[01:49:46] at this apartment okay yeah and when you made it out so you had your son and your daughter with you when
[01:49:52] you made it out my my my son came here well that's right so he was already here that's right
[01:49:59] but when I came here in 1994 my daughter came with me got it yeah so your son and your
[01:50:07] daughter were here or your son was already here your daughter came with you and now they're working
[01:50:13] and started to figure out life in America how big of a shock was that to you? I did the
[01:50:20] last time I was I was sad because they hope I do nothing waiting for the what is going to happen
[01:50:30] because at that time they were trying to catch a shield and see for me so as I can
[01:50:38] I started so they can keep me here and it's a lot of a petition at that time I
[01:50:46] could not even have a head as with a little of a petition
[01:50:51] you know right and in the sixth the 1996 I got a citizen
[01:51:04] in the United States you got your citizenship here in America. She's then you went to
[01:51:10] set the clear fire department yeah I look for that I don't know after that I I go to school
[01:51:18] for the accounting class and after one year I got the
[01:51:24] is up in the Santa Clara fire department for almost three years and then I ran out of
[01:51:33] the budgets and I was there and I then brought for six months and again the others are up in the
[01:51:43] I-R-I-S. Oh you worked for the IRS? Yeah. Okay well suppose we'll have to figure that out. Yeah
[01:51:49] he's one of them he goes from a good guy a hero to the IRS and how long were you at the IRS for
[01:51:57] a form of 2000 to 2013. Totally news and that was it after that you retired? Yeah
[01:52:07] and what are you doing now? Sleep and watch TV. No more prairie fire emergencies but
[01:52:16] at first I was it was really morning I tried to look for the part-time job but I couldn't
[01:52:27] put the part-time job so then you just had it you just hear retirement now. You look for a
[01:52:35] part-time job that wasn't anything. I don't care what I want to know what's anything
[01:52:41] this is maybe about four hours six hours a day. You're ready to work? Yeah.
[01:52:49] Ready to work. Sick of watching TV. And you're up in this area here in the San Jose area.
[01:52:58] Yeah, San Jose. She's the day I came here. Okay because we might be able to find a job for you.
[01:53:02] Somebody probably looking for someone. Got it. Yeah. What the work on that? Yeah. Yeah.
[01:53:07] Oh, tilt. Did I miss anything? I mean well let me rephrase that. I know we missed. I know there's
[01:53:13] all kinds of stories. Is there anything else that you want to bring up? No I think those are the
[01:53:17] major stories. Just the documented ones. Indeed. Because that's one thing I mean when you talk
[01:53:23] when we talk when we broke down your 3000 combat flight hours. I mean we could probably we
[01:53:29] you could talk for you know 3000 hours explaining what happened on all those missions. So
[01:53:35] I mean just unbelievable that you were able to get through all that crazy.
[01:53:44] On my friend he told me that I they couldn't believe that I still live with the due to date.
[01:53:52] For sure. For sure. For sure. So tell anything else though. No I we covered the major points
[01:54:01] there and you know just like that one time with the Marines need help here he comes he just went
[01:54:08] there under fire and so many times his kingbees got shot up. I mean 40 50 rounds of the holes
[01:54:16] of this. Just amazing stories and the men were just so many of our saw guys that are live today.
[01:54:25] Thanks to the kingbeepiles period and of course the other avidus but in our case we had that
[01:54:31] direct relationship with them. There were primary assets they put us in they always came to pull
[01:54:36] us out. The pat walk is thing you let off with just a classic moment just captured the essence
[01:54:42] of that underground intense firefight and here comes the kingbee. Not only did you come he
[01:54:49] settles into a bomb career so you can get on the hill up there and go home.
[01:54:52] On anything else you want to add? Well I'll tell you what it's just been an honor to talk to you
[01:55:05] and thank you so much for coming on and more important thank you for your service and your sacrifice.
[01:55:12] It's we won't forget it and you took so many risks. You took so many risks and you paid
[01:55:19] such a price in order to save your comrades and your brother's norms and to be there for the
[01:55:25] guys on the ground and we appreciate that and we appreciate the fact that you stood the line
[01:55:32] to defend freedom in the world. So thank you. And during the secret war the kingbees were
[01:55:39] another secret that nobody knew about. And so I thank you for doing this to get the story about
[01:55:45] our heroic on any other kingbee pilots. Unfortunately many of whom we've lost. We buried captain
[01:55:53] two on two months ago three months ago and our secret war had its secrets and one of the gems
[01:56:01] one of the great assets were our kingbees and we slew to every day and their brothers and arms.
[01:56:06] So thank you for doing that, Jaka. It's an honor. We appreciate it. Thank you.
[01:56:10] Thank you. And with that tilt and on have left the building and once again we are left with an
[01:56:22] example of what human beings can do, what human beings can face, what human beings can overcome.
[01:56:28] Pretty amazing. Pretty humbling. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:56:45] Feel like we can do more. Yeah. I mean that's pretty much the general kind of overall consensus
[01:56:53] as I feel like we can do more. Yeah. Feel like we need to do more. Feel like I need to do more.
[01:56:58] Anyways, I don't want to bring you over. Yeah. Like the group me and your team and team.
[01:57:04] Process of trying to do more. Because I think sometimes I think you feel like maybe you're good
[01:57:08] with what you're doing. Sure. Well, yeah. I don't know. Maybe maybe not. But yes, I think so. So
[01:57:13] you know, he mentioned and we all know that he lost both his hands and then later on join the
[01:57:21] fire department. So he was in the count and met the fire department. But yes, he's in the fire department
[01:57:26] with no hands. Yeah. And by the way, I mean this is he lost his hands, both hands. And I asked him
[01:57:33] about it. He's like, oh yeah, well then I went to. He was no like there was no hesitation in carrying
[01:57:41] on with what he was going to do. He's just going to whatever I guess he's going to get hooks and he's
[01:57:45] going to carry on. That's what he's doing. And then at the end, which kind of gives you an insight
[01:57:52] to like how he's thinking where he's like, yeah, I'm like retired and I kind of just made a joke like
[01:57:58] I just sleep and watch TV and he's like, man, I'm kind of looking for a part that I'm job like
[01:58:02] you've got to go do some stuff. You know what I was thinking about? If somebody told you a story
[01:58:07] where they said, listen, here's what's going on. I was in a helicopter. I was flying the helicopter
[01:58:11] and the controls of the helicopter were burning and they were on fire. But and I couldn't hold on
[01:58:19] to him. So I just let him go. And then right as we were about to crash, I just grabbed onto him and
[01:58:25] I steered the plane, I just steered the aircraft, the helicopter and I got it to land and we lived.
[01:58:31] But those those controls were so hot. It was crazy. Okay. So if you heard that,
[01:58:37] you would think one level of the word hot, right? And there's no way that the level of hot that
[01:58:44] could be explained to you is so hot that you lose both of your hands from voluntarily grabbing the controls.
[01:58:51] Like that does. And then as you're trying to get your seat belt off your hands or just ripping apart,
[01:58:55] falling apart. Yeah. So yeah, and that opening, that opening that I read from on the ground with the
[01:59:04] book on the ground by John Stracker Meyer, it's just, it's crazy to think, you know, you, oh,
[01:59:09] guess what? There's going to be two dangerous. So I'm not going to take a co-pilot or a crew chief.
[01:59:16] All's I'm going to bring is a door gunner, me. That's it. That's what we're doing. That's another
[01:59:23] level. Yeah. By the way, you're sitting on a base like warm, whatever. I don't know, cool. Maybe
[01:59:30] you're an AC. You just had a piece of chicken or something. Like life is pretty good, right?
[01:59:37] And I'm to mention these guys in Vietnam, they're like have to go home at night, like till we'll
[01:59:41] say, hey, oh, cool. I'm going to go home now. Yeah. Because I think when I was on deployment,
[01:59:48] I just put all that family stuff out of my brain. Yeah. I wasn't thinking about my wife. Yeah.
[01:59:52] I was in just the deployment mode. I think it'll be really hard to go. Oh, deployment mode. Well,
[02:00:00] singing ballet recital with the child. Yeah. You know, they say, hey, don't bring your work home or what,
[02:00:07] you know, what's that saying? Yeah. Right. That's not the level right there. It's another level.
[02:00:12] Check. So yes, we can do more. So yeah. All right. Well, keep yourself. Keep us. We're keeping
[02:00:19] ourselves in the game. We're all getting older. We're not getting younger. But that way. Maybe some
[02:00:26] of us are okay. Okay. So you're just going back in time. We've added video. There's this thing you
[02:00:33] can do that freezes the frame. Right. So that's kind of what you you you you feel that you're doing.
[02:00:40] Freezes the frame. Yeah. Okay. Cool. Well, when you're working out anyway, you need supplementation.
[02:00:45] That's undeniable. I guess you could deny it if you wanted to nonetheless supplementate that be a mistake.
[02:00:52] I think you'd be a mistake, yes, sir. So anyway, joc was supplement is called jockel fuel. So these
[02:00:58] supplements include, but not limited to joint warfare for your joints, super cruel oil. Also for your joints.
[02:01:03] General health. Some omega 3's in there. These are important. What I'm saying. Also discipline,
[02:01:11] discipline, go. Three versions. Now three versions of the discipline powder. Do you drink powder every
[02:01:17] day in the morning? Kind of yes. Matter of fact yes. And so I was thinking about this. So in the morning,
[02:01:22] I drink coffee. Am I coffee drink? I don't know. Maybe maybe not. I don't drink coffee every single
[02:01:28] morning. But that's like as far as morning routines go. Coffee's not part of your routine. I know
[02:01:35] that. Definitely not part of my routine. But is the discipline? Could you get a workout, right? So you take the
[02:01:39] discipline every morning before the workout? No. I take it before I work work. After the workout.
[02:01:45] Yeah, when I wake up in the morning, I don't drink anything. I just drink water. Water, but go. Yeah,
[02:01:49] that's a good one. All right, interesting. That is interesting. I just don't know. Now I'm going to
[02:01:53] when I'm going to the juts on the way there on drinking discipline for your troops. I'll dare to
[02:02:01] three scams actually. Well, sometimes actually four. There you go. But nonetheless, and then, um, yes.
[02:02:09] So there is part of version. Also capsule version. Cool. That's when you're on the go. And then the
[02:02:15] energy drink healthy energy drink version. See, this is a good one. So in this far as energy drinks go,
[02:02:26] like we say, you can have an energy drink, but if even saying energy drink kind of brings along
[02:02:33] the stigma of the energy drink. Definitely discipline. Go. Energy drink RTD does not have that stigma.
[02:02:40] Because it is factually healthy. Truth. Truth. True. Anyway, sometimes you look at me, you want me to
[02:02:47] give you backup. No, on your statement. No. And I just got that look, then you were made a complete
[02:02:52] talk. Right. So you're nothing else from me to add. Yes, sir. No, it's good for you. A lot of times
[02:02:58] I look at you because like, sometimes you'll have this look like, oh, let me, like, you remember
[02:03:05] something. Yeah, like you want to, you know, and I just want to give you that opportunity. Oh, thank
[02:03:09] you. Thank you. I always have a nice, thank you for the opportunity. Just say sometimes. Sometimes
[02:03:14] you say some good stuff. Anyway, yeah. Also, Mark, these are in the form protein, protein in the form
[02:03:20] to dessert. Six and one, half dozen the other. Yes, sir. Either way, we do know this. We're getting
[02:03:25] something that's tasty and good for us. Good for us. And so you get to essentially just say it's good.
[02:03:30] It's good because that covers all bases. Good for you. Good tasting. It depends on what kind of
[02:03:37] good, because there's a lot of kinds of good and for good various things. You've been doing a lot of
[02:03:42] work a lot of lawyer activity with me lately about well, it depends on what you mean by. Yeah,
[02:03:47] because it's interesting. Yeah, because you can't just blanket statement a lot of stuff. Like,
[02:03:53] okay, so my daughter asked me what's your favorite color? So I'm like, all right, well, it kind of
[02:03:57] depends. Like, let's say black was my favorite color. But the same time, like, I don't necessarily
[02:04:04] want everything to be black. Some things I want to be red. Like, I don't want to eat a black
[02:04:08] strawberry. I'll tell you that. Okay. You see what I'm saying, though. A lot of these questions.
[02:04:15] Okay. Like I said, you're doing a lot of these questions. Demand a little bit of a
[02:04:20] little camera. Next question. Well, you'd want to eat a camel orange. Yes. You do want to. If
[02:04:25] there was such a thing, if you get an orange that was camel, we just called it a camel. It said
[02:04:30] an orange. All right. Well, I just think of like, what if my wife's face was camel? I'm not
[02:04:38] again. That wouldn't be too bad either. All right. Well, whatever. All right. Cool. I'll simply
[02:04:43] find my answers. How about that? Cool. Cool. Anyway. All these things. Jockel, few available in various
[02:04:50] locations, including origimayn.com. Yes. Final min shot. Absolutely. And as far as discipline, go
[02:04:57] energy drink cans. Wow. Yes. Available straight up. And by the way, also on Amazon. Yes, sure. Also speaking

[02:06:04] Yeah. And you might think to yourself, oh, oh, American made jeans, right? Okay. I know what
[02:06:09] that's going to be. That's going to be a $350 pair of jeans. That's what you might be thinking
[02:06:15] that. Potent. You're thinking wrong. Actually, you're thinking wrong. Get yourself a couple of
[02:06:20] pair of origin jeans. And listen, they're not as cheap as we want them to be right now. But as we grow,
[02:06:27] as we scale, we will be able to get the price down even more. But join the, join the club of
[02:06:38] supporting America. That's true. Also boots like I said, also talk with the store. It's called
[02:06:46] Jocquistor. It's speaking of clubs. We have another club. It's not really a club. It's just a
[02:06:51] subscription. Yeah, the club. I mean, really, anyway, it's a subscription-based t-shirt scenario.
[02:06:57] I like that way better than club. I think club is something that you do. Unless you're in a
[02:07:03] motorcycle gang club. Yeah. Then that's one. That's like one. Also it depends. Oh,
[02:07:10] that's just sort of a real name. Right. But it depends on the word. What you mean by club. Why are you
[02:07:16] being a lawyer? Because you're over here. You know, you see what I'm saying. Anyway, yes,
[02:07:21] club subscription-based t-shirt. It's situation. Which you are wearing one today. Is this the
[02:07:25] initial rule? Launch mode? It's the one of the ones. I would say that one's dope. Yeah. And you know,
[02:07:31] I don't throw that. You know, it's around very often. It's in the wild. Yeah, but yes, yes, sir. I like your layers.
[02:07:36] I don't know. And yeah, you know, these t-shirt ideas, you know, they come, they go. Some sticks.
[02:07:42] I'm don't stick. But this is like an opportunity for all of us to sort of, you know, capitalize on
[02:07:47] some of the cool t-shirt ideas that just fly in from time to time. Yeah. And just like the ideas coming
[02:07:55] go, the shirts will come and go. Every month. I want to get one of these shirts. And they're gone.
[02:08:00] Anyway, talk of story.com. That's where you can jump on that. If you want, also on
[02:08:03] jockelster.com, you can get the this bin equals freedom. Good. All these stuff. All these stuff.

[02:08:38] little video fantasy. All right, kids. You will always say that and hey, man, good. But when you think
[02:08:45] about it, YouTube channel, you're talking about enhanced videos. Videos of weed at some point
[02:08:51] started calling enhanced. Okay, maybe I made that up. But either way, they're not that many of them.

[02:09:02] technically, the YouTube channel is more you than anything. So you know, I'm just saying you put it on me a lot.
[02:09:08] So I'm just saying it. It's kind of both of us. I don't know. It's sort of the outlet for your
[02:09:14] stuff though. Kind of. Yeah, I guess that's kind of true. I got to see your stuff being out. You
[02:09:19] haven't read any books yet. That's true. You don't. Do you have a podcast? I guess you have this podcast.
[02:09:24] Technically, yeah, I guess. No, that's true. Because yes, if I want to express myself in any
[02:09:30] capacity to come creatively, yeah, where is it going to land? It's going to land on the YouTube
[02:09:34] channel. Like me. I'm over writing songs. I'm over playing guitar. Oh, yeah. I'm painting. I'm drawing.

[02:12:41] if you want to help out in a bunch of different ways and check out Mark Lee's mom. Her name is
[02:12:46] Mamali. She's got a charity organization. And if you want to donate or you want to get involved, go to
[02:12:50] America's MightyOrators.org. And listen, if you seek personal internal agony, it's what you want,
[02:13:01] what you want is to cause pain to yourself and we can deliver. You can get more of my lack
[02:13:08] luster, allocations. You already can need more of, I think this one's good. If you need more of
[02:13:15] echoes in explicable explanations. So I sent my explicable. You can find us on the
[02:13:25] in-depth Twitter, Instagram, which just so echo knows when I'm talking about when I say Instagram. I know you'll
[02:13:30] need to refer to as the Graham and on Facebook. Echoes at EqualCharles. I'm at Joccal,
[02:13:36] and most important John Streccharmire is on Instagram at J. Streccharmire. And thanks once again to Captain
[02:13:45] On for taking the time to share his experiences with us and more importantly for risking his life over
[02:13:54] and over and over again for his brothers on the ground and for freedom. And thanks to every one of you
[02:14:05] out there in every branch service army, Navy Air Force Marines Coast Guard, and to all of our allies
[02:14:10] that have stood by us on the battlefield to protect the sacred ideal of freedom. Thank you.
[02:14:16] And thanks to those of you in uniform on the home front police and law enforcement, firefighters,
[02:14:22] paramedics, EMTs, dispatchers, correctional officers, border patrol, secret service, and all the
[02:14:29] first responders. Thank you for keeping us safe here at home. And to everyone else out there,
[02:14:35] think of Captain On. Think of taking care of others. Think of recognizing the risk of his mission.
[02:14:48] Going into an area where they had already lost helicopters and deciding
[02:14:54] at the moment a truth that you would just go with one other man.
[02:14:57] And so as to save as many lives as possible, a decision which for him was perfectly logical
[02:15:07] and as he said, no big deal. When the call came, he went and we all should do the same.
[02:15:18] Go. And until next time, the Zekko and Joko out.
