00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.16
This is Jockelpontcast number 292.

2
00:00:03.16 --> 00:00:05.76
With echo Charles and me, Jockel Willing.

3
00:00:05.76 --> 00:00:06.76
Good evening, echo.

4
00:00:06.76 --> 00:00:07.76
Good evening.

5
00:00:10.76 --> 00:00:16.76
August 2nd 2006 was the worst day of my life.

6
00:00:19.48 --> 00:00:24.64
Ryan Joe Bedbin, gravely wounded by a single enemy round

7
00:00:24.64 --> 00:00:27.24
that hit his weapon as he looked down.

8
00:00:27.24 --> 00:00:30.84
It's sights and then ripped into his face,

9
00:00:30.84 --> 00:00:35.76
rendering him blind and critically injured.

10
00:00:35.76 --> 00:00:39.72
And then soon after, Ryan was wounded,

11
00:00:39.72 --> 00:00:45.84
markedly who had stepped into the enemy line of fire

12
00:00:45.84 --> 00:00:50.12
to engage the enemy and protect his teammates while assaulting

13
00:00:50.12 --> 00:00:53.44
a building was shot killed.

14
00:00:53.44 --> 00:01:01.44
Mark was a larger than life character in every aspect.

15
00:01:01.44 --> 00:01:09.44
Smart athletic charismatic charming talented, tough,

16
00:01:09.44 --> 00:01:16.44
and also hilarious and faithful and loyal and obviously brave.

17
00:01:16.44 --> 00:01:21.44
Now he was gone.

18
00:01:21.44 --> 00:01:31.44
And in tasking a bruiser, we closed ranks to get through it.

19
00:01:31.44 --> 00:01:34.44
We celebrated his life.

20
00:01:34.44 --> 00:01:37.44
We mourned his loss.

21
00:01:37.44 --> 00:01:43.44
And then we loaded him on his last flight home.

22
00:01:43.44 --> 00:01:45.44
His angel flight.

23
00:01:45.44 --> 00:01:53.44
And we got support from our chain of command from my commanding officer.

24
00:01:53.44 --> 00:01:57.44
That's the old team three are command master chief, the operations master chief.

25
00:01:57.44 --> 00:02:02.44
And the rest of the sealed team three backed us up and assisted us

26
00:02:02.44 --> 00:02:08.44
as we worked through this devastation.

27
00:02:08.44 --> 00:02:10.44
But it didn't stop there.

28
00:02:10.44 --> 00:02:15.44
I got a call in my tactical operations center.

29
00:02:15.44 --> 00:02:26.44
It was from Admiral Joe Maguire, the senior seal officer in charge of all of Naval Special Warfare.

30
00:02:26.44 --> 00:02:30.44
In charge of the sealed teams, in charge of the boat teams, in charge of the training center,

31
00:02:30.44 --> 00:02:32.44
and charge of everything.

32
00:02:32.44 --> 00:02:39.44
And I had previously worked for him directly for 13 months as his aide

33
00:02:39.44 --> 00:02:42.44
to camp and I knew how busy he was.

34
00:02:42.44 --> 00:02:44.44
And I knew what his daily schedule was like.

35
00:02:44.44 --> 00:02:48.44
And I knew the demands that were upon him.

36
00:02:48.44 --> 00:02:52.44
But I also knew that he cared.

37
00:02:52.44 --> 00:02:54.44
He cared deeply about the seal teams.

38
00:02:54.44 --> 00:02:59.44
He cared about his seals.

39
00:02:59.44 --> 00:03:02.44
And he cared about me.

40
00:03:02.44 --> 00:03:06.44
And he called to check in with me.

41
00:03:06.44 --> 00:03:10.44
And he called.

42
00:03:10.44 --> 00:03:16.44
He told me that he was reviewing the silver star that I had submitted for Mark.

43
00:03:16.44 --> 00:03:27.44
That he was about to send it directly to the chief of Naval Operations for a signature based on my recommendation.

44
00:03:27.44 --> 00:03:32.44
He told me that he was sorry for our loss.

45
00:03:32.44 --> 00:03:39.44
And he assured me that he would take care of Mark's family.

46
00:03:42.44 --> 00:03:46.44
He also told me that we were doing the right thing.

47
00:03:46.44 --> 00:03:48.44
And to keep doing it.

48
00:03:48.44 --> 00:03:50.44
To keep taking the fight to the enemy.

49
00:03:50.44 --> 00:03:52.44
To keep eliminating enemy fighters.

50
00:03:52.44 --> 00:03:54.44
To keep protecting the local populace.

51
00:03:54.44 --> 00:03:58.44
To keep the pressure on.

52
00:03:58.44 --> 00:04:02.44
Because the war wasn't over.

53
00:04:02.44 --> 00:04:05.44
And the enemy wasn't going to stand down.

54
00:04:05.44 --> 00:04:09.44
We still had work to do.

55
00:04:09.44 --> 00:04:12.44
Lots of it.

56
00:04:12.44 --> 00:04:15.44
And he knew that.

57
00:04:15.44 --> 00:04:18.44
And so did I.

58
00:04:18.44 --> 00:04:21.44
And that meant a lot.

59
00:04:21.44 --> 00:04:27.44
To know that the Admiral in charge of all the seals was there for us.

60
00:04:27.44 --> 00:04:30.44
Was there for Mark.

61
00:04:30.44 --> 00:04:34.44
Was there for Mark's family.

62
00:04:38.44 --> 00:04:41.44
About three months later.

63
00:04:41.44 --> 00:04:44.44
October 21st, 2006.

64
00:04:44.44 --> 00:04:55.44
My plane landed at Naval Air Station, North Island, with the last members of Task Unit Bruser to come home.

65
00:04:55.44 --> 00:05:00.44
And Admiral Maguire was there.

66
00:05:00.44 --> 00:05:03.44
To welcome the home.

67
00:05:03.44 --> 00:05:07.44
To be sure that we were okay.

68
00:05:07.44 --> 00:05:11.44
Because he cared about his seals.

69
00:05:11.44 --> 00:05:15.44
He cared about his troops.

70
00:05:15.44 --> 00:05:17.44
Then that meant a lot.

71
00:05:17.44 --> 00:05:24.44
And soon I was hugging my wife and kids on the tarmac.

72
00:05:24.44 --> 00:05:31.44
But even as I embraced my family.

73
00:05:31.44 --> 00:05:36.44
I knew I hadn't brought all my men home.

74
00:05:36.44 --> 00:05:43.44
And that burden will always be present.

75
00:05:43.44 --> 00:05:49.44
But it helped to know that leaders like Admiral Maguire were there.

76
00:05:49.44 --> 00:06:00.44
To help shoulder that burden to support us and to take care of the families of our fallen.

77
00:06:00.44 --> 00:06:02.44
And it's an honor.

78
00:06:02.44 --> 00:06:05.44
Tonight to have Admiral Joseph Maguire.

79
00:06:05.44 --> 00:06:09.44
Here with us to share some of his experiences.

80
00:06:09.44 --> 00:06:15.44
And lessons learned from his 36 years of military service.

81
00:06:15.44 --> 00:06:19.44
And his experiences in the civilian sector.

82
00:06:19.44 --> 00:06:22.44
Admiral, thank you for coming by.

83
00:06:22.44 --> 00:06:24.44
Jaco, it's an honor to be with you.

84
00:06:24.44 --> 00:06:25.44
I really is.

85
00:06:25.44 --> 00:06:28.44
Which has been entirely too long since you and I've been together.

86
00:06:28.44 --> 00:06:30.44
We've been through an awful lot together.

87
00:06:30.44 --> 00:06:33.44
It's an honor to be with you and an absolute honor to be with you on this podcast.

88
00:06:33.44 --> 00:06:35.44
So thank you so much for those kind words.

89
00:06:35.44 --> 00:06:37.44
And thank you for the warm welcome.

90
00:06:37.44 --> 00:06:40.44
Well, I'm sure we'll get into that a little bit more.

91
00:06:40.44 --> 00:06:42.44
But to start off with.

92
00:06:42.44 --> 00:06:47.44
Let's start at the beginning, which I believe is in Brooklyn.

93
00:06:47.44 --> 00:06:48.44
That's where you're born, right?

94
00:06:48.44 --> 00:06:50.44
You got a problem with that?

95
00:06:50.44 --> 00:06:52.44
No, Jaco forget about it.

96
00:06:52.44 --> 00:06:54.44
That's why I'm from.

97
00:06:54.44 --> 00:06:57.44
Yeah, you know, America's fourth largest city, four million people.

98
00:06:57.44 --> 00:07:01.44
And it was a street rat, you know, grew up in New York City.

99
00:07:01.44 --> 00:07:08.44
And, you know, people don't understand that actually Brooklyn is on Long Island.

100
00:07:08.44 --> 00:07:12.44
So I spent my time in the ocean.

101
00:07:12.44 --> 00:07:18.44
I started surfing when I was 16 with the money that I bought my first surfboard with the money I got from shoveling snow.

102
00:07:18.44 --> 00:07:22.44
That's pretty wetsuits or at least pretty good wetsuits.

103
00:07:22.44 --> 00:07:24.44
Well, I very loose.

104
00:07:24.44 --> 00:07:32.44
You know, but I'll tell you this though, Jaco when I went to, you know, Buds and they, you know, folks out there, I'm sure you know this from listening to Jaco's podcast.

105
00:07:32.44 --> 00:07:36.44
But, you know, when I did, you show up, they shave your head completely bald.

106
00:07:36.44 --> 00:07:46.44
And when I had my head shaved by the instructors, we'll have a sit and they will call the knee shot a rover to take a look at my skull because it's clearly a city kid.

107
00:07:46.44 --> 00:07:50.44
I had three concussions, but, yeah, no.

108
00:07:50.44 --> 00:07:58.44
But between growing up in Brooklyn and going to Catholic school, the seal instructors were, you know, he's absolutely melted to do it.

109
00:07:58.44 --> 00:08:00.44
But yeah, what would your parents do?

110
00:08:00.44 --> 00:08:04.44
Well, my dad was a World War II veteran and what he, what he doing, he was, he was a veteran.

111
00:08:04.44 --> 00:08:07.44
He was a military police.

112
00:08:07.44 --> 00:08:15.44
So my father was in Patin's third army, which till the day he died was the proudest thing he ever did in his life.

113
00:08:15.44 --> 00:08:24.44
And, but, you know, war was different back then that my father was there, but, I mean, everybody was there.

114
00:08:24.44 --> 00:08:29.44
My uncles were there, flight surgeons, and they went toward together.

115
00:08:29.44 --> 00:08:37.44
And he spent about, he actually joined the army in 1940 before the war started.

116
00:08:37.44 --> 00:08:48.44
And came home from Europe after being deployed for four years and in, in, in, in, in, in the July and married my mother, we're going to have later.

117
00:08:48.44 --> 00:08:51.44
They've been engaged.

118
00:08:51.44 --> 00:08:58.44
And on the 15th of August, he was shipping out to the Pacific for the invasion of Japan.

119
00:08:58.44 --> 00:09:03.44
And, you know, so fortunately, he didn't have to go and do that.

120
00:09:03.44 --> 00:09:10.44
Well, my father then joined the reserves after that and he spent 30 years in the United States military.

121
00:09:10.44 --> 00:09:15.44
And my brother Ben spent 26 years in the Navy as a supplier, core officer.

122
00:09:15.44 --> 00:09:16.44
He retired.

123
00:09:16.44 --> 00:09:20.44
And my other brother, Bob was an elistic guy for, for six years as well.

124
00:09:20.44 --> 00:09:27.44
And when I took my uniform off in July of 2010, it was the first time in 70 years.

125
00:09:27.44 --> 00:09:31.44
That immediate member of my family was not wearing the cloth of the nation.

126
00:09:31.44 --> 00:09:38.44
So, then I could say we haven't went them all, but the McGuire's were integral in winning the Cold War.

127
00:09:38.44 --> 00:09:40.44
There's absolutely no doubt about that.

128
00:09:40.44 --> 00:09:43.44
So, you're going up to high school.

129
00:09:43.44 --> 00:09:45.44
What did you play any other sports besides surfing?

130
00:09:45.44 --> 00:09:46.44
No, I swim.

131
00:09:46.44 --> 00:09:48.44
Yeah, no, I was a swimmer.

132
00:09:48.44 --> 00:09:50.44
And it's one of those things.

133
00:09:50.44 --> 00:09:56.44
Not so much in high school, but I would say, if it wasn't for swimming, I never would have gotten a bachelor's degree.

134
00:09:56.44 --> 00:10:02.44
So, the season would go in the fall into the winter.

135
00:10:02.44 --> 00:10:07.44
And I would be on the Dean's list while I was swimming in discipline.

136
00:10:07.44 --> 00:10:09.44
You know, we're about discipline.

137
00:10:09.44 --> 00:10:10.44
You teach you the whole time.

138
00:10:10.44 --> 00:10:13.44
But once this will be season, took a lap, so did I.

139
00:10:13.44 --> 00:10:16.44
And I just kind of got by and this brings some of us there.

140
00:10:16.44 --> 00:10:20.44
But, no, I spent, I swam for, you know, my college.

141
00:10:20.44 --> 00:10:22.44
I was the captain of the college team.

142
00:10:22.44 --> 00:10:24.44
And I also swam for the New York Athletic Club.

143
00:10:24.44 --> 00:10:28.44
And, uh, be honest with you, I thought, like most New Yorkers,

144
00:10:28.44 --> 00:10:32.44
that I was going to just live and die in New York City.

145
00:10:32.44 --> 00:10:35.44
So, be in a member of the New York Athletic Club.

146
00:10:35.44 --> 00:10:38.44
We will all on scholarship and the New York Athletic Club.

147
00:10:38.44 --> 00:10:45.44
They just took the top swimmers from all of the colleges and put us together after the college season.

148
00:10:45.44 --> 00:10:47.44
And back then it was a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a.

149
00:10:47.44 --> 00:10:50.44
And we have a swimming practice at the New York Athletic Club.

150
00:10:50.44 --> 00:10:53.44
We'd have to go and coat and tie to practice.

151
00:10:53.44 --> 00:10:56.44
But it was right next to Central Park South.

152
00:10:56.44 --> 00:11:01.44
But we had a stipend credit card for X amount of dollars a month.

153
00:11:01.44 --> 00:11:05.44
So after swimming practice, we went down to the bar.

154
00:11:05.44 --> 00:11:08.44
So to refuel.

155
00:11:08.44 --> 00:11:17.44
Oh, it is. So, so the, so the, over the course of a couple of years for the New York Athletic Club and graduating from college and there are a couple of businessmen that I knew there.

156
00:11:17.44 --> 00:11:20.44
And they said, sure, we want to take you to dinner.

157
00:11:20.44 --> 00:11:24.44
Okay. So we're in dinner in one of the stakeholders in Manhattan.

158
00:11:24.44 --> 00:11:28.44
And, you know, my friend made the pitch.

159
00:11:28.44 --> 00:11:31.44
He said, we want you to come into the advertising firm.

160
00:11:31.44 --> 00:11:34.44
Well, you know, guys, I'm not even a business major.

161
00:11:34.44 --> 00:11:36.44
So what is it that you want me to do?

162
00:11:36.44 --> 00:11:41.44
Joe, all we want you to do is entertain the clients.

163
00:11:41.44 --> 00:11:44.44
We're in the future of the business. I could do that, man.

164
00:11:44.44 --> 00:11:47.44
So, you know, I'm getting ready to be a man.

165
00:11:47.44 --> 00:11:51.44
And I'm going to the Madison Avenue. My brother is what year is this?

166
00:11:51.44 --> 00:11:53.44
This is 1974.

167
00:11:53.44 --> 00:11:57.44
So, so when, when you're grown up, I mean Vietnam is going on.

168
00:11:57.44 --> 00:12:00.44
I brought my brother, my brother's served Vietnam.

169
00:12:00.44 --> 00:12:03.44
Yeah, both my brothers.

170
00:12:03.44 --> 00:12:07.44
And obviously, you know, I've had to make that decision.

171
00:12:07.44 --> 00:12:11.44
Either graduate from college or, you know, go into Vietnam as an listed guy.

172
00:12:11.44 --> 00:12:16.44
But my father being a current owner, my other was just said, like, you know, that's just, I mean, you know, you were listed man yourself.

173
00:12:16.44 --> 00:12:18.44
That's the hardest part.

174
00:12:18.44 --> 00:12:23.44
But in Vietnam is the NCOs that are the military and is the NCOs that do the fighting and dying.

175
00:12:23.44 --> 00:12:31.44
But my father encouraged me to finish college and then go, if you, if you really want to go into the service, you know, then go in with your college degree.

176
00:12:31.44 --> 00:12:36.44
So I graduated in 1974, but the war was was over by then.

177
00:12:36.44 --> 00:12:43.44
And so my brother, from my father, I heard that I was going to go into Madison Avenue.

178
00:12:43.44 --> 00:12:54.44
So he was stationed here in San Diego on the USS Ranger and flew to New York City and arranged for an officer candidate school test for me.

179
00:12:54.44 --> 00:12:57.44
And I did not participate in this decision.

180
00:12:57.44 --> 00:13:04.44
So I was sitting at the kitchen table and my father goes, Ben, what do you want to tell your brother?

181
00:13:04.44 --> 00:13:08.44
You're going to take the test for officer candidate school tomorrow.

182
00:13:08.44 --> 00:13:13.44
He's five years old. My father looked at me. Okay, you know.

183
00:13:13.44 --> 00:13:18.44
So I mean, so I went down there. Now keep in mind, I'm swimming.

184
00:13:18.44 --> 00:13:23.44
I got paired down to my shoulders back then. It's all bleach blonde from the chlorine.

185
00:13:23.44 --> 00:13:28.44
So I go down and I take the test, which I like the SATs.

186
00:13:28.44 --> 00:13:31.44
And I'm very deliberate, actually slow.

187
00:13:31.44 --> 00:13:35.44
There were a lot of big words that I had to sound out the test, you know.

188
00:13:35.44 --> 00:13:42.44
And so you turn the paper in and they grade the paper and debrief the individual based on.

189
00:13:42.44 --> 00:13:45.44
And I was one of the very last ones to finish.

190
00:13:45.44 --> 00:13:50.44
And it was a crummy office there in Manhattan was downtown Manhattan right by city hall.

191
00:13:50.44 --> 00:13:57.44
And only had was a little crummy office dividers that you know, like 18 inches below and it only goes up about four and a half feet.

192
00:13:57.44 --> 00:14:02.44
And they got folding chairs at the other side and you can hear everything on the other side.

193
00:14:02.44 --> 00:14:08.44
So they're bringing them in and Guy sits down. He says, well, you know, Mr. Smith, you could take the test again next year.

194
00:14:08.44 --> 00:14:13.44
Oh, gee, Mr. Brown, you could take the test again. So nobody was passed to the test.

195
00:14:13.44 --> 00:14:17.44
So I'm there. I said to my brother, I don't think I'd passed. You said, well, we'll see.

196
00:14:17.44 --> 00:14:23.44
So I go in and I sit down and the recruit is go, so Joe, you want to join the Navy?

197
00:14:23.44 --> 00:14:28.44
No, man. I just took his hands off.

198
00:14:28.44 --> 00:14:31.44
My brother smacks me in the head.

199
00:14:31.44 --> 00:14:36.44
You're going to join the Navy? Okay.

200
00:14:36.44 --> 00:14:39.44
And they recruited a looking at me like, what do you want to do?

201
00:14:39.44 --> 00:14:44.44
My brother was a supply co-rocessor. He wants to be a supply co-rocessor.

202
00:14:44.44 --> 00:14:49.44
So yeah, that's what I wanted to do.

203
00:14:49.44 --> 00:14:54.44
So look at the score and I look at my brother. This is my brother's proudest moment.

204
00:14:54.44 --> 00:14:57.44
They got a little brother to score high enough.

205
00:14:57.44 --> 00:15:01.44
You can't be as a supply co-rocessor.

206
00:15:01.44 --> 00:15:05.44
And I said, well, what do you want to do? I mean, this is only about 15 hours.

207
00:15:05.44 --> 00:15:07.44
So I got the wheels turned in.

208
00:15:07.44 --> 00:15:11.44
And now back then, we were doing the Apollo recovery.

209
00:15:11.44 --> 00:15:17.44
And the astronauts would land in the water.

210
00:15:17.44 --> 00:15:19.44
And sometimes the recovery carrier wasn't there.

211
00:15:19.44 --> 00:15:22.44
They had, so they had these B-roll human interest stories.

212
00:15:22.44 --> 00:15:26.44
So recently, there was a human interest story about the recovery.

213
00:15:26.44 --> 00:15:31.44
And there were two seals, you know, who were on the Olympic team.

214
00:15:31.44 --> 00:15:34.44
Now, I was not on the Olympic team, not at that caliber.

215
00:15:34.44 --> 00:15:36.44
But because they were, I knew of them.

216
00:15:36.44 --> 00:15:39.44
And one was in COT-1 and one was in UD-T-13.

217
00:15:39.44 --> 00:15:44.44
And they did a human interest story on the seals.

218
00:15:44.44 --> 00:15:46.44
And now keep in mind, Jaco.

219
00:15:46.44 --> 00:15:48.44
This is 1974.

220
00:15:48.44 --> 00:15:51.44
We have less than 800 people in the community.

221
00:15:51.44 --> 00:15:53.44
Nobody knows what it is.

222
00:15:53.44 --> 00:15:56.44
And they said, so what do you want to do?

223
00:15:56.44 --> 00:15:57.44
You don't want to do?

224
00:15:57.44 --> 00:15:59.44
I want to be a UD-T as a seal-t.

225
00:15:59.44 --> 00:16:03.44
Give them a hard look, right?

226
00:16:03.44 --> 00:16:06.44
So the children, I mean, they just look at like,

227
00:16:06.44 --> 00:16:09.44
these guys were aviators and surface warfare guys.

228
00:16:09.44 --> 00:16:11.44
So they just turned in my brother.

229
00:16:11.44 --> 00:16:13.44
This will be back.

230
00:16:13.44 --> 00:16:15.44
So now, they went back for about 10 minutes.

231
00:16:15.44 --> 00:16:17.44
It was probably like, you know, buying a car.

232
00:16:17.44 --> 00:16:19.44
Where I got to go talk to my manager.

233
00:16:19.44 --> 00:16:21.44
They come back 10 minutes later.

234
00:16:21.44 --> 00:16:23.44
They talked to my brother.

235
00:16:23.44 --> 00:16:25.44
And I mean, well, my brother has to sat down.

236
00:16:25.44 --> 00:16:26.44
He's still standing over me.

237
00:16:26.44 --> 00:16:29.44
And I'm sitting in the chair because I was told this.

238
00:16:29.44 --> 00:16:32.44
And they talked to my brothers first and they turned to me.

239
00:16:32.44 --> 00:16:37.44
They say, well, sorry, Joe, but there's no commission officers in UD-T-T-A-C-L-T.

240
00:16:37.44 --> 00:16:39.44
And I was perceived at the time.

241
00:16:39.44 --> 00:16:42.44
That's BS, but I didn't say BS, right?

242
00:16:42.44 --> 00:16:45.44
And of course, my brothers max being the head again.

243
00:16:45.44 --> 00:16:47.44
And because Joe, they would lie to you.

244
00:16:47.44 --> 00:16:48.44
Now here I'm a civilian.

245
00:16:48.44 --> 00:16:49.44
I'm turning my brother.

246
00:16:49.44 --> 00:16:50.44
I go, they're recruiters.

247
00:16:50.44 --> 00:16:52.44
That's what they do.

248
00:16:52.44 --> 00:16:53.44
And they were lying.

249
00:16:53.44 --> 00:16:55.44
I went to me as you know.

250
00:16:55.44 --> 00:17:00.44
So I wound up going to surface warfare to the USS Coronado.

251
00:17:00.44 --> 00:17:04.44
And I spent time on that to become a surface warfare officer before.

252
00:17:04.44 --> 00:17:07.44
I got to Coronado, California to become a seal.

253
00:17:07.44 --> 00:17:13.44
And I will tell you this, that the demanding life on board ship.

254
00:17:13.44 --> 00:17:17.44
By the time I got to budget training, I thought that was good news.

255
00:17:17.44 --> 00:17:22.44
And with guys who are quitting, I just put my arm around them and give them the counseling session.

256
00:17:22.44 --> 00:17:25.44
It's just like, you don't know what it's like.

257
00:17:25.44 --> 00:17:28.44
Look, we got a mini mark down the street.

258
00:17:28.44 --> 00:17:29.44
Life is good.

259
00:17:29.44 --> 00:17:31.44
Did you have to go to Osirch Godo, yes?

260
00:17:31.44 --> 00:17:32.44
I did.

261
00:17:32.44 --> 00:17:33.44
Is that what you did?

262
00:17:33.44 --> 00:17:34.44
I did.

263
00:17:34.44 --> 00:17:36.44
How was that shock and awe experience?

264
00:17:36.44 --> 00:17:41.44
Well, you realize like in the first couple of days that you've been duped.

265
00:17:41.44 --> 00:17:45.44
It's five o'clock in the morning and then wake in the up.

266
00:17:45.44 --> 00:17:48.44
And you got to be outside in five minutes and you PT gear PT.

267
00:17:48.44 --> 00:17:49.44
Come on.

268
00:17:49.44 --> 00:17:50.44
You know?

269
00:17:50.44 --> 00:17:51.44
Yeah.

270
00:17:51.44 --> 00:17:54.44
So that was a great experience actually.

271
00:17:54.44 --> 00:17:57.44
And it was the beginning.

272
00:17:57.44 --> 00:18:00.44
It was a tremendous maturation start for me.

273
00:18:00.44 --> 00:18:01.44
Taxi, join the military.

274
00:18:01.44 --> 00:18:03.44
Go to OCS.

275
00:18:03.44 --> 00:18:06.44
Have drill instructors teaching you.

276
00:18:06.44 --> 00:18:07.44
They had expectations.

277
00:18:07.44 --> 00:18:09.44
They had standards.

278
00:18:09.44 --> 00:18:13.44
And then also, you were measured and you had to live up to something.

279
00:18:13.44 --> 00:18:18.44
And really it was transformational for me.

280
00:18:18.44 --> 00:18:24.44
And I wound up doing pretty well in OCS.

281
00:18:24.44 --> 00:18:27.44
And did well on board the ship.

282
00:18:27.44 --> 00:18:29.44
And you know what I got by the time I got to, you know,

283
00:18:29.44 --> 00:18:31.44
Buds Class in 93.

284
00:18:31.44 --> 00:18:33.44
We was a usual bit.

285
00:18:33.44 --> 00:18:36.44
You know, we started off with 147 guys in the class.

286
00:18:36.44 --> 00:18:38.44
And finished with 17.

287
00:18:38.44 --> 00:18:40.44
And I was standard there.

288
00:18:40.44 --> 00:18:43.44
And you know, be honest with you, Chaco.

289
00:18:43.44 --> 00:18:44.44
Nobody.

290
00:18:44.44 --> 00:18:48.44
But nobody was more surprised than I wanted to be in the army of man.

291
00:18:48.44 --> 00:18:50.44
Because I told a cat that I was married.

292
00:18:50.44 --> 00:18:51.44
Oh, you were the honor man.

293
00:18:51.44 --> 00:18:55.44
But I mean, I told, I mean, we came back from San Clemente.

294
00:18:55.44 --> 00:18:56.44
She was, how you doing?

295
00:18:56.44 --> 00:18:57.44
They got a couch up to me this week.

296
00:18:57.44 --> 00:18:59.44
I know I'm going to get killed this week.

297
00:18:59.44 --> 00:19:01.44
You just never know it to your graduate.

298
00:19:01.44 --> 00:19:03.44
And when they announced what the honor man was,

299
00:19:03.44 --> 00:19:05.44
I was just kind of like,

300
00:19:05.44 --> 00:19:07.44
it must be some mistake.

301
00:19:07.44 --> 00:19:11.44
But yeah, so that was a great experience.

302
00:19:11.44 --> 00:19:13.44
It's, you know, Buds is a defining thing.

303
00:19:13.44 --> 00:19:15.44
And hell, we could sort of find anything for all of us.

304
00:19:15.44 --> 00:19:17.44
But the one thing about that is,

305
00:19:17.44 --> 00:19:18.44
you know, all starts there.

306
00:19:18.44 --> 00:19:20.44
It all shapes it.

307
00:19:20.44 --> 00:19:23.44
And you know, every one of us, whether you're the Admiral with his

308
00:19:23.44 --> 00:19:27.44
folks in Ramadi in Felicia or the guys in Ramadi in Felicia,

309
00:19:27.44 --> 00:19:31.44
whether you are the guy with stars in his collar or the guys with

310
00:19:31.44 --> 00:19:33.44
shepherds on his collar,

311
00:19:33.44 --> 00:19:36.44
we all wear the same warfare insignia.

312
00:19:36.44 --> 00:19:40.44
There is no difference between a seal officer and a seal

313
00:19:40.44 --> 00:19:42.44
enlisted man as far as what he had to do to earn that.

314
00:19:42.44 --> 00:19:45.44
Now, the career is different over the time.

315
00:19:45.44 --> 00:19:48.44
But it's one thing that we all understand.

316
00:19:48.44 --> 00:19:49.44
It was the crucible.

317
00:19:49.44 --> 00:19:50.44
It's a defining thing.

318
00:19:50.44 --> 00:19:52.44
And you go through that.

319
00:19:52.44 --> 00:19:54.44
And, you know, it starts your journey.

320
00:19:54.44 --> 00:19:56.44
That doesn't really make you a seal.

321
00:19:56.44 --> 00:19:58.44
When you get your tried and pinned on you,

322
00:19:58.44 --> 00:20:03.44
that's your beginning of learning how to really become a seal.

323
00:20:03.44 --> 00:20:04.44
And it takes an, I'll tell you,

324
00:20:04.44 --> 00:20:06.44
until the day I took off my uniform,

325
00:20:06.44 --> 00:20:08.44
I learned every single day.

326
00:20:08.44 --> 00:20:10.44
And as you know, the same goes.

327
00:20:10.44 --> 00:20:12.44
You've got to earn it every single day.

328
00:20:12.44 --> 00:20:14.44
Was there anything at Buds that was hard for you?

329
00:20:14.44 --> 00:20:16.44
Because if you were a collegiate swimmer,

330
00:20:16.44 --> 00:20:20.44
the swim's must have been like a jail, a break for you.

331
00:20:20.44 --> 00:20:22.44
Yeah.

332
00:20:22.44 --> 00:20:24.44
Because that's question.

333
00:20:24.44 --> 00:20:26.44
What about Ron, were you good, runner?

334
00:20:26.44 --> 00:20:27.44
Oh, no.

335
00:20:27.44 --> 00:20:31.44
No, so, so, so, so, so, so that's the point that really,

336
00:20:31.44 --> 00:20:35.44
really, really upset me, Chaco, is that Buds is a running club.

337
00:20:35.44 --> 00:20:37.44
It's not a swimming club, you know,

338
00:20:37.44 --> 00:20:39.44
but that is what saved me.

339
00:20:39.44 --> 00:20:41.44
Because I don't think I ever told you this either,

340
00:20:41.44 --> 00:20:44.44
but I wound up with a broken leg in third phase.

341
00:20:44.44 --> 00:20:46.44
So, a severe stress fracture.

342
00:20:46.44 --> 00:20:50.44
And, you know, I was not a bad runner.

343
00:20:50.44 --> 00:20:52.44
We were up there, the third phase.

344
00:20:52.44 --> 00:20:55.44
We probably had about 20 guys, 24 guys in the class.

345
00:20:55.44 --> 00:20:57.44
And I was up in the top five,

346
00:20:57.44 --> 00:20:59.44
whatever finished time runs,

347
00:20:59.44 --> 00:21:01.44
or, you know, when, when, do you do your run,

348
00:21:01.44 --> 00:21:03.44
that's run back to the compound, do your run your own.

349
00:21:03.44 --> 00:21:07.44
But, I was having a lot of trouble,

350
00:21:07.44 --> 00:21:09.44
and I didn't know what it was.

351
00:21:09.44 --> 00:21:13.44
By a lot of trouble, I'm ten minutes behind the class,

352
00:21:13.44 --> 00:21:15.44
but I'm running.

353
00:21:15.44 --> 00:21:16.44
But I'm running.

354
00:21:16.44 --> 00:21:17.44
And, you know, you know, you know,

355
00:21:17.44 --> 00:21:19.44
you're the instructors, watch this stuff.

356
00:21:19.44 --> 00:21:22.44
So, back then, we did not have the facilities

357
00:21:22.44 --> 00:21:25.44
and the help that are young of candidates have.

358
00:21:25.44 --> 00:21:28.44
And, we had an E6, a quorum in.

359
00:21:28.44 --> 00:21:31.44
And, you know, he told me, he said,

360
00:21:31.44 --> 00:21:32.44
I want you to come in.

361
00:21:32.44 --> 00:21:34.44
I had to leave the class, no.

362
00:21:34.44 --> 00:21:36.44
We're willing to third phase.

363
00:21:36.44 --> 00:21:38.44
We hadn't gone to the island yet.

364
00:21:38.44 --> 00:21:41.44
But, he said, I want you to go across the street

365
00:21:41.44 --> 00:21:42.44
and get an X-ray.

366
00:21:42.44 --> 00:21:44.44
You're a instructor.

367
00:21:44.44 --> 00:21:46.44
You know, that's always the right answer.

368
00:21:46.44 --> 00:21:49.44
So, I come, I come,

369
00:21:49.44 --> 00:21:52.44
hobbling out of the third phase office.

370
00:21:52.44 --> 00:21:55.44
And, the senior, the list of guys,

371
00:21:55.44 --> 00:21:58.44
senior chief Johnny Johnson outside smoking a cigarette,

372
00:21:58.44 --> 00:22:00.44
like any good, sealed back.

373
00:22:00.44 --> 00:22:03.44
And, obviously, he said, you know,

374
00:22:03.44 --> 00:22:04.44
Mr. Guarher stop.

375
00:22:04.44 --> 00:22:06.44
You know, when his instructor tells you to stop, you stop.

376
00:22:06.44 --> 00:22:07.44
He said, get over here.

377
00:22:07.44 --> 00:22:09.44
So, I go over to him and he says,

378
00:22:09.44 --> 00:22:10.44
where you going?

379
00:22:10.44 --> 00:22:11.44
So, well, senior chief,

380
00:22:11.44 --> 00:22:13.44
from going across the street for an X-ray.

381
00:22:13.44 --> 00:22:15.44
No, you're not.

382
00:22:15.44 --> 00:22:17.44
Of course, I'm not senior chief.

383
00:22:17.44 --> 00:22:19.44
He goes, what's up?

384
00:22:19.44 --> 00:22:21.44
He said, well, you know, I got a little trouble.

385
00:22:21.44 --> 00:22:22.44
So, I tell you what, Mr. Mack,

386
00:22:22.44 --> 00:22:24.44
you got a broken leg.

387
00:22:24.44 --> 00:22:25.44
He said, there's no doubt in my mind.

388
00:22:25.44 --> 00:22:26.44
You got a broken leg.

389
00:22:26.44 --> 00:22:27.44
So, here's the deal.

390
00:22:27.44 --> 00:22:28.44
You go back in there.

391
00:22:28.44 --> 00:22:29.44
You put your medical record in there.

392
00:22:29.44 --> 00:22:31.44
I'm not going to get any guarantees.

393
00:22:31.44 --> 00:22:32.44
But if you will, in the gut,

394
00:22:32.44 --> 00:22:33.44
I'll see what we can do.

395
00:22:33.44 --> 00:22:35.44
You'll see, new chief.

396
00:22:35.44 --> 00:22:37.44
And so, went back in there.

397
00:22:37.44 --> 00:22:39.44
And I actually, you know,

398
00:22:39.44 --> 00:22:42.44
was able to, I was always behind in the runs.

399
00:22:42.44 --> 00:22:45.44
But I was able to hop on the obstacle course.

400
00:22:45.44 --> 00:22:47.44
I still finish at a top five in that,

401
00:22:47.44 --> 00:22:49.44
because that's all technique.

402
00:22:49.44 --> 00:22:51.44
But we used to run as, as you know,

403
00:22:51.44 --> 00:22:54.44
a little jacquo from the compound down to the center,

404
00:22:54.44 --> 00:22:56.44
center beach in Coronado,

405
00:22:56.44 --> 00:22:59.44
which is probably a little over mile.

406
00:22:59.44 --> 00:23:01.44
And then in the water.

407
00:23:01.44 --> 00:23:04.44
So, I would be the last one in the water by light years,

408
00:23:04.44 --> 00:23:06.44
but I would be the first one out of the water.

409
00:23:06.44 --> 00:23:08.44
So, at least the instructor's new that,

410
00:23:08.44 --> 00:23:09.44
I'm putting out.

411
00:23:09.44 --> 00:23:11.44
But the other thing I think that there was thoroughly

412
00:23:11.44 --> 00:23:14.44
entertained that they really didn't want me out of the country.

413
00:23:14.44 --> 00:23:17.44
But, you know, you know,

414
00:23:17.44 --> 00:23:20.44
the folks who are out there,

415
00:23:20.44 --> 00:23:22.44
the instructors,

416
00:23:22.44 --> 00:23:23.44
are the ones that really,

417
00:23:23.44 --> 00:23:27.44
they are the gatekeepers for who's going to wind up going to a seal team.

418
00:23:27.44 --> 00:23:30.44
And they are instructors for just a limited period of time.

419
00:23:30.44 --> 00:23:32.44
And then they go back to the seal team.

420
00:23:32.44 --> 00:23:34.44
And the young men that they're training

421
00:23:34.44 --> 00:23:37.44
are going to become their teammates.

422
00:23:37.44 --> 00:23:38.44
So, for the most part,

423
00:23:38.44 --> 00:23:39.44
they're sizing them up,

424
00:23:39.44 --> 00:23:41.44
not only to meet the standards,

425
00:23:41.44 --> 00:23:42.44
but also to kind of say,

426
00:23:42.44 --> 00:23:45.44
is this somebody that I want to be a teammate with?

427
00:23:45.44 --> 00:23:47.44
And if I get into the trouble,

428
00:23:47.44 --> 00:23:48.44
and I'm left,

429
00:23:48.44 --> 00:23:50.44
one of these guys in my left and my right.

430
00:23:50.44 --> 00:23:53.44
And I think that even if I was having a difficult time there,

431
00:23:53.44 --> 00:23:56.44
I was most fortunate to have good instructors.

432
00:23:56.44 --> 00:23:58.44
And back then,

433
00:23:58.44 --> 00:24:00.44
everybody was Vietnam veteran.

434
00:24:00.44 --> 00:24:03.44
Everybody had a solvest arm.

435
00:24:03.44 --> 00:24:07.44
And I was blessed to have a Medal of Honorary Scipient

436
00:24:07.44 --> 00:24:08.44
is one of my instructors.

437
00:24:08.44 --> 00:24:10.44
So, Mike Thornton.

438
00:24:10.44 --> 00:24:13.44
And that helps shape me as well,

439
00:24:13.44 --> 00:24:14.44
more ways than one.

440
00:24:14.44 --> 00:24:17.44
But these guys had known the crucible of combat.

441
00:24:17.44 --> 00:24:20.44
And they were looking at students,

442
00:24:20.44 --> 00:24:22.44
and nobody really cared if nobody graduated back then.

443
00:24:22.44 --> 00:24:25.44
But they were looking at,

444
00:24:25.44 --> 00:24:26.44
you know,

445
00:24:26.44 --> 00:24:28.44
can we trust this guy and combat?

446
00:24:28.44 --> 00:24:30.44
And I think that was the standard.

447
00:24:30.44 --> 00:24:32.44
But I have to say, in retrospect,

448
00:24:32.44 --> 00:24:33.44
it wasn't me.

449
00:24:33.44 --> 00:24:36.44
It was the instructors that really showed me tremendous kindness.

450
00:24:36.44 --> 00:24:38.44
But, you know,

451
00:24:38.44 --> 00:24:45.44
it just was not easy being able to do this stuff that we needed to do at the end of training.

452
00:24:45.44 --> 00:24:47.44
But, you know,

453
00:24:47.44 --> 00:24:49.44
I think it was a kid to try to do this.

454
00:24:49.44 --> 00:24:51.44
There was a class,

455
00:24:51.44 --> 00:24:52.44
and it wasn't just before.

456
00:24:52.44 --> 00:24:56.44
It wasn't a class 85 or 86 where literally no one made it.

457
00:24:56.44 --> 00:24:57.44
That's correct.

458
00:24:57.44 --> 00:24:59.44
What, what, what class do you know what a class number of that was?

459
00:24:59.44 --> 00:25:00.44
I don't,

460
00:25:00.44 --> 00:25:01.44
but I think you're close.

461
00:25:01.44 --> 00:25:04.44
But the other one was Admiral Eric Olsen's class.

462
00:25:04.44 --> 00:25:07.44
wound up with four people in that week.

463
00:25:07.44 --> 00:25:11.44
And the instructor has had to help them carry the IVS.

464
00:25:11.44 --> 00:25:14.44
Because the quick four guys could carry the IVS.

465
00:25:14.44 --> 00:25:15.44
You need to keep the IVS.

466
00:25:15.44 --> 00:25:18.44
It's got to be at least six guys here to get to the week.

467
00:25:18.44 --> 00:25:21.44
But yeah, Eric had four guys when he got his graduation picture.

468
00:25:21.44 --> 00:25:26.44
And one of the students is a foreign student in his class.

469
00:25:26.44 --> 00:25:28.44
So three Americans and one foreign guy.

470
00:25:28.44 --> 00:25:31.44
But it was a different, different, different time back then.

471
00:25:31.44 --> 00:25:32.44
But you know, the instructors,

472
00:25:32.44 --> 00:25:33.44
how to the back of their belt,

473
00:25:33.44 --> 00:25:36.44
the block app,

474
00:25:36.44 --> 00:25:37.44
we made them quit.

475
00:25:37.44 --> 00:25:38.44
We, you know.

476
00:25:38.44 --> 00:25:39.44
So,

477
00:25:39.44 --> 00:25:42.44
you know, there were standards.

478
00:25:42.44 --> 00:25:45.44
But they were pretty much on their own, as far as the,

479
00:25:45.44 --> 00:25:46.44
what they wanted to do.

480
00:25:46.44 --> 00:25:47.44
But I'll be honest with you.

481
00:25:47.44 --> 00:25:50.44
These are instructors that I had tremendous respect for.

482
00:25:50.44 --> 00:25:51.44
And, uh,

483
00:25:51.44 --> 00:25:53.44
respect for their combat experience.

484
00:25:53.44 --> 00:25:54.44
And they were,

485
00:25:54.44 --> 00:25:56.44
they were great instructors.

486
00:25:56.44 --> 00:25:58.44
Because they were intense.

487
00:25:58.44 --> 00:26:00.44
And if you didn't have the standard,

488
00:26:00.44 --> 00:26:02.44
uh, even if you were making the standard.

489
00:26:02.44 --> 00:26:04.44
And it was tough to see a class make go.

490
00:26:04.44 --> 00:26:05.44
But in retrospect,

491
00:26:05.44 --> 00:26:06.44
they were right.

492
00:26:06.44 --> 00:26:07.44
Uh,

493
00:26:07.44 --> 00:26:08.44
this guy would not have fit in,

494
00:26:08.44 --> 00:26:09.44
uh,

495
00:26:09.44 --> 00:26:10.44
to us.

496
00:26:10.44 --> 00:26:11.44
But yeah.

497
00:26:11.44 --> 00:26:12.44
So graduating and that,

498
00:26:12.44 --> 00:26:14.44
that off to jump school, which was always a,

499
00:26:14.44 --> 00:26:15.44
they're born.

500
00:26:15.44 --> 00:26:16.44
Yeah, that's it.

501
00:26:16.44 --> 00:26:16.44
You know,

502
00:26:16.44 --> 00:26:17.44
what do we call us,

503
00:26:17.44 --> 00:26:18.44
crammed into three?

504
00:26:18.44 --> 00:26:21.44
So you hit Airborne School.

505
00:26:21.44 --> 00:26:23.44
I'm sure it was the,

506
00:26:23.44 --> 00:26:23.44
uh,

507
00:26:23.44 --> 00:26:25.44
the challenge to keep your,

508
00:26:25.44 --> 00:26:28.44
I'm sure there's a lot of challenges that airborne school for you.

509
00:26:28.44 --> 00:26:32.44
I can imagine the runs were not as challenging as trying to control your mouth,

510
00:26:32.44 --> 00:26:34.44
talking to the army folks.

511
00:26:34.44 --> 00:26:37.44
No.

512
00:26:37.44 --> 00:26:38.44
No.

513
00:26:38.44 --> 00:26:39.44
I,

514
00:26:39.44 --> 00:26:40.44
I got called into the kernel a couple of times.

515
00:26:40.44 --> 00:26:43.44
So actually,

516
00:26:43.44 --> 00:26:44.44
so,

517
00:26:44.44 --> 00:26:45.44
uh,

518
00:26:45.44 --> 00:26:48.44
for those of you out there have been through forbending you understand this.

519
00:26:48.44 --> 00:26:49.44
Um,

520
00:26:49.44 --> 00:26:50.44
uh,

521
00:26:50.44 --> 00:26:51.44
uh,

522
00:26:51.44 --> 00:26:53.44
the army's a little bit different than,

523
00:26:53.44 --> 00:26:54.44
uh,

524
00:26:54.44 --> 00:26:54.44
the,

525
00:26:54.44 --> 00:26:55.44
the seal tubes.

526
00:26:55.44 --> 00:26:55.44
Uh,

527
00:26:55.44 --> 00:26:55.44
uh,

528
00:26:55.44 --> 00:26:57.44
it's a sum to great.

529
00:26:57.44 --> 00:26:58.44
And,

530
00:26:58.44 --> 00:26:59.44
uh,

531
00:26:59.44 --> 00:26:59.44
uh,

532
00:26:59.44 --> 00:27:00.44
they'd have an evolution.

533
00:27:00.44 --> 00:27:02.44
And then what they would do is they would have the,

534
00:27:02.44 --> 00:27:06.44
the class line up and you go online and you'd pick up trash.

535
00:27:06.44 --> 00:27:08.44
And,

536
00:27:08.44 --> 00:27:09.44
well,

537
00:27:09.44 --> 00:27:11.44
guys who are working picking up trash.

538
00:27:11.44 --> 00:27:13.44
And the block hats did just,

539
00:27:13.44 --> 00:27:14.44
Mr. Gwire,

540
00:27:14.44 --> 00:27:16.44
what are you doing? You supposed to be picking up trash.

541
00:27:16.44 --> 00:27:17.44
I'm not picking up trash.

542
00:27:17.44 --> 00:27:19.44
Pick up trash.

543
00:27:19.44 --> 00:27:20.44
I'm not picking up trash.

544
00:27:20.44 --> 00:27:21.44
I'll have to see the kernel.

545
00:27:21.44 --> 00:27:22.44
Okay.

546
00:27:22.44 --> 00:27:23.44
So I'm at the kernel.

547
00:27:23.44 --> 00:27:25.44
You have to stand in the narrative.

548
00:27:25.44 --> 00:27:26.44
Tension.

549
00:27:26.44 --> 00:27:27.44
Put me at parade rest.

550
00:27:27.44 --> 00:27:28.44
Watch out.

551
00:27:28.44 --> 00:27:29.44
I so well,

552
00:27:29.44 --> 00:27:30.44
uh,

553
00:27:30.44 --> 00:27:31.44
kernel.

554
00:27:31.44 --> 00:27:33.44
I'm a conventional officer in the United States Navy.

555
00:27:33.44 --> 00:27:33.44
Uh,

556
00:27:33.44 --> 00:27:35.44
did you ever see bridge on the river?

557
00:27:35.44 --> 00:27:38.44
Yeah.

558
00:27:38.44 --> 00:27:39.44
Yeah.

559
00:27:39.44 --> 00:27:40.44
Why's that got to do with it?

560
00:27:40.44 --> 00:27:41.44
I said,

561
00:27:41.44 --> 00:27:45.44
do you remember when the kernel wound up in the cooler because they were making his officers work because it was a violation of the GDP convention?

562
00:27:45.44 --> 00:27:48.44
He's looking at me.

563
00:27:48.44 --> 00:27:49.44
I said,

564
00:27:49.44 --> 00:27:51.44
so to have your commission officers picking up trash,

565
00:27:51.44 --> 00:27:52.44
you realized that you've got to,

566
00:27:52.44 --> 00:27:54.44
violation of your GDP convention.

567
00:27:54.44 --> 00:27:56.44
So he threw me out of his office,

568
00:27:56.44 --> 00:28:01.44
but me and the other sea of officers with me did not have to pick up trash.

569
00:28:01.44 --> 00:28:05.44
Oh, that's it.

570
00:28:05.44 --> 00:28:06.44
All right.

571
00:28:06.44 --> 00:28:09.44
So you're done with the airborne school and then it's after what?

572
00:28:09.44 --> 00:28:10.44
UDT-21.

573
00:28:10.44 --> 00:28:11.44
After UDT-21.

574
00:28:11.44 --> 00:28:14.44
So it was under one and demolition team 21.

575
00:28:14.44 --> 00:28:15.44
And um,

576
00:28:15.44 --> 00:28:18.44
but just like in SIL training,

577
00:28:18.44 --> 00:28:19.44
um,

578
00:28:19.44 --> 00:28:21.44
all of the guys there for the month,

579
00:28:21.44 --> 00:28:23.44
there were guys there from the Korean War,

580
00:28:23.44 --> 00:28:24.44
who just stayed UDT,

581
00:28:24.44 --> 00:28:25.44
didn't go to Vietnam.

582
00:28:25.44 --> 00:28:27.44
They went to the Vietnam as UDT,

583
00:28:27.44 --> 00:28:29.44
but they were former SIL team two guys.

584
00:28:29.44 --> 00:28:30.44
So we had SIL team two.

585
00:28:30.44 --> 00:28:31.44
And UDT-21.

586
00:28:31.44 --> 00:28:33.44
And they went back and forth.

587
00:28:33.44 --> 00:28:37.44
But so you wound up getting five or six jumps at basic airborne.

588
00:28:37.44 --> 00:28:39.44
And um,

589
00:28:39.44 --> 00:28:42.44
then we had a jump schedule shortly after,

590
00:28:42.44 --> 00:28:43.44
uh,

591
00:28:43.44 --> 00:28:45.44
I got back to the team from,

592
00:28:45.44 --> 00:28:46.44
from Fort Benning.

593
00:28:46.44 --> 00:28:49.44
And we went up to Fort Lee to,

594
00:28:49.44 --> 00:28:49.44
um,

595
00:28:49.44 --> 00:28:49.44
uh,

596
00:28:49.44 --> 00:28:51.44
do do because in,

597
00:28:51.44 --> 00:28:52.44
in the teams back then,

598
00:28:52.44 --> 00:28:54.44
you get your 10th jump.

599
00:28:54.44 --> 00:28:56.44
And you had to buy a kick of beer.

600
00:28:56.44 --> 00:28:57.44
So they got the Lieutenant J.J.,

601
00:28:57.44 --> 00:28:58.44
the nugget there,

602
00:28:58.44 --> 00:28:59.44
who is,

603
00:28:59.44 --> 00:29:01.44
so they're going to get me four jumps today.

604
00:29:01.44 --> 00:29:05.44
And so it was an old UH-1 Vietnam single-engine.

605
00:29:05.44 --> 00:29:06.44
And they,

606
00:29:06.44 --> 00:29:07.44
they take the doors,

607
00:29:07.44 --> 00:29:09.44
put them all the way back.

608
00:29:09.44 --> 00:29:10.44
And you're sitting there.

609
00:29:10.44 --> 00:29:12.44
This is a static line jump.

610
00:29:12.44 --> 00:29:13.44
And they take your static line.

611
00:29:13.44 --> 00:29:15.44
And they hook you into a cable.

612
00:29:15.44 --> 00:29:18.44
Just below the transmission on the helicopter.

613
00:29:18.44 --> 00:29:21.44
And you sit with your legs outside the helicopter.

614
00:29:21.44 --> 00:29:23.44
And there's just a little,

615
00:29:23.44 --> 00:29:24.44
um,

616
00:29:24.44 --> 00:29:25.44
uh,

617
00:29:25.44 --> 00:29:27.44
tape that goes across you.

618
00:29:27.44 --> 00:29:28.44
And you,

619
00:29:28.44 --> 00:29:29.44
you get on board at first.

620
00:29:29.44 --> 00:29:30.44
And, uh,

621
00:29:30.44 --> 00:29:32.44
the aircraft is not doing 80 turns up.

622
00:29:32.44 --> 00:29:33.44
So then,

623
00:29:33.44 --> 00:29:36.44
the aircraft command starts to do with the turn up.

624
00:29:36.44 --> 00:29:38.44
And the helicopter starts to rack in back and forth.

625
00:29:38.44 --> 00:29:39.44
As the,

626
00:29:39.44 --> 00:29:39.44
you know,

627
00:29:39.44 --> 00:29:40.44
and all of a sudden,

628
00:29:40.44 --> 00:29:41.44
I look around now.

629
00:29:41.44 --> 00:29:44.44
These are all senior and listed guys.

630
00:29:44.44 --> 00:29:45.44
And they,

631
00:29:45.44 --> 00:29:46.44
one by one,

632
00:29:46.44 --> 00:29:48.44
take their teeth out of their mouth.

633
00:29:48.44 --> 00:29:51.44
And put it in their pocket to the jump.

634
00:29:51.44 --> 00:29:54.44
I was the only one of the stick of eight that actually had teeth.

635
00:29:54.44 --> 00:29:56.44
They just laughed away when they were out there.

636
00:29:56.44 --> 00:29:58.44
And I'm thinking of myself,

637
00:29:58.44 --> 00:30:00.44
what did I get into?

638
00:30:00.44 --> 00:30:02.44
It's just a unity or a hockey player.

639
00:30:02.44 --> 00:30:04.44
So,

640
00:30:04.44 --> 00:30:05.44
well,

641
00:30:05.44 --> 00:30:06.44
make a long story short.

642
00:30:06.44 --> 00:30:07.44
It was a long day,

643
00:30:07.44 --> 00:30:09.44
but I bought a cake of beer at the end of the day.

644
00:30:09.44 --> 00:30:10.44
And then,

645
00:30:10.44 --> 00:30:11.44
what was that?

646
00:30:11.44 --> 00:30:11.44
What was the,

647
00:30:11.44 --> 00:30:14.44
what did you do at UD-21 to go?

648
00:30:14.44 --> 00:30:15.44
What were you doing for the deployments?

649
00:30:15.44 --> 00:30:17.44
Where there was ship board deployments?

650
00:30:17.44 --> 00:30:17.44
Yeah,

651
00:30:17.44 --> 00:30:18.44
there was ship board deployments.

652
00:30:18.44 --> 00:30:20.44
It made quite a few deployments to the Caribbean.

653
00:30:20.44 --> 00:30:20.44
Uh,

654
00:30:20.44 --> 00:30:21.44
you know,

655
00:30:21.44 --> 00:30:23.44
back then we had a much more robust fleet.

656
00:30:23.44 --> 00:30:25.44
So, we actually made Caribbean deployments.

657
00:30:25.44 --> 00:30:27.44
European deployments,

658
00:30:27.44 --> 00:30:29.44
northern European deployments.

659
00:30:29.44 --> 00:30:29.44
So,

660
00:30:29.44 --> 00:30:32.44
I made several Caribbean deployments

661
00:30:32.44 --> 00:30:33.44
and South American deployments,

662
00:30:33.44 --> 00:30:35.44
but in addition to that,

663
00:30:35.44 --> 00:30:39.44
we also had time to be able to go to schools.

664
00:30:39.44 --> 00:30:40.44
And, you know,

665
00:30:40.44 --> 00:30:45.44
just to some of our CIA schools and these other things in regard to,

666
00:30:45.44 --> 00:30:46.44
you know,

667
00:30:46.44 --> 00:30:47.44
how to do targeting and,

668
00:30:47.44 --> 00:30:48.44
and really,

669
00:30:48.44 --> 00:30:49.44
it was all explosives.

670
00:30:49.44 --> 00:30:50.44
It was under what a demolition.

671
00:30:50.44 --> 00:30:52.44
And CIA was really good at that.

672
00:30:52.44 --> 00:30:53.44
And,

673
00:30:53.44 --> 00:30:55.44
they're combat-dibbled kitchen demolition.

674
00:30:55.44 --> 00:30:56.44
These other things.

675
00:30:56.44 --> 00:30:59.44
But, I also then, at that point in time,

676
00:30:59.44 --> 00:31:00.44
Jaco,

677
00:31:00.44 --> 00:31:00.44
uh,

678
00:31:00.44 --> 00:31:03.44
with some courses decided to take some intelligence courses.

679
00:31:03.44 --> 00:31:04.44
And,

680
00:31:04.44 --> 00:31:05.44
just kind of,

681
00:31:05.44 --> 00:31:06.44
well,

682
00:31:06.44 --> 00:31:09.44
I think that Intel and Naval Special Warfare kind of go hand-in-glove.

683
00:31:09.44 --> 00:31:12.44
So, I want to learn as much as I can about the intelligence community,

684
00:31:12.44 --> 00:31:12.44
uh,

685
00:31:12.44 --> 00:31:13.44
well,

686
00:31:13.44 --> 00:31:14.44
I'm there.

687
00:31:14.44 --> 00:31:14.44
But,

688
00:31:14.44 --> 00:31:15.44
I had an opportunity to,

689
00:31:15.44 --> 00:31:16.44
you know,

690
00:31:16.44 --> 00:31:18.44
be a department head there as well.

691
00:31:18.44 --> 00:31:19.44
And then,

692
00:31:19.44 --> 00:31:19.44
you know,

693
00:31:19.44 --> 00:31:21.44
be in charge of a UD-T-Platue,

694
00:31:21.44 --> 00:31:22.44
you know,

695
00:31:22.44 --> 00:31:22.44
back then was,

696
00:31:22.44 --> 00:31:23.44
you know,

697
00:31:23.44 --> 00:31:24.44
25 men.

698
00:31:24.44 --> 00:31:25.44
So,

699
00:31:25.44 --> 00:31:26.44
it was good.

700
00:31:26.44 --> 00:31:27.44
And, of course,

701
00:31:27.44 --> 00:31:29.44
my chief,

702
00:31:29.44 --> 00:31:30.44
and my LPO,

703
00:31:30.44 --> 00:31:30.44
you know,

704
00:31:30.44 --> 00:31:32.44
both of those guys have got silver stars.

705
00:31:32.44 --> 00:31:33.44
And,

706
00:31:33.44 --> 00:31:34.44
you know,

707
00:31:34.44 --> 00:31:35.44
they school was in session.

708
00:31:35.44 --> 00:31:36.44
You know,

709
00:31:36.44 --> 00:31:37.44
you're in charge of the officer.

710
00:31:37.44 --> 00:31:39.44
There is absolutely no doubt about it.

711
00:31:39.44 --> 00:31:40.44
But,

712
00:31:40.44 --> 00:31:42.44
you better know what you don't know,

713
00:31:42.44 --> 00:31:44.44
and be willing to listen to those who do.

714
00:31:44.44 --> 00:31:45.44
And,

715
00:31:45.44 --> 00:31:46.44
these guys,

716
00:31:46.44 --> 00:31:47.44
very lovingly,

717
00:31:47.44 --> 00:31:48.44
I mean,

718
00:31:48.44 --> 00:31:49.44
this is fairly.

719
00:31:49.44 --> 00:31:51.44
Took me under their wing,

720
00:31:51.44 --> 00:31:53.44
and adopted me.

721
00:31:53.44 --> 00:31:54.44
And, I'll be honest with you.

722
00:31:54.44 --> 00:31:55.44
Even back then,

723
00:31:55.44 --> 00:31:56.44
Rudy Bosch,

724
00:31:56.44 --> 00:31:59.44
who is the command master chief at

725
00:31:59.44 --> 00:32:00.44
at Seal Team 2,

726
00:32:00.44 --> 00:32:02.44
he became the command master chief in 1962

727
00:32:02.44 --> 00:32:04.44
and left in 1987.

728
00:32:04.44 --> 00:32:05.44
You know,

729
00:32:05.44 --> 00:32:06.44
it took a basketball ball,

730
00:32:06.44 --> 00:32:07.44
he ball hocks,

731
00:32:07.44 --> 00:32:08.44
but you know,

732
00:32:08.44 --> 00:32:09.44
who really,

733
00:32:09.44 --> 00:32:13.44
but even if I was in UD-T,

734
00:32:13.44 --> 00:32:15.44
my LPO and my chiefs,

735
00:32:15.44 --> 00:32:16.44
who were Seal Team 2 guys,

736
00:32:16.44 --> 00:32:18.44
that's how I met Rudy,

737
00:32:18.44 --> 00:32:19.44
and Rudy and his wife,

738
00:32:19.44 --> 00:32:20.44
then mentored,

739
00:32:20.44 --> 00:32:22.44
Kathy and me,

740
00:32:22.44 --> 00:32:23.44
until we were close friends,

741
00:32:23.44 --> 00:32:25.44
until he,

742
00:32:25.44 --> 00:32:26.44
you know,

743
00:32:26.44 --> 00:32:28.44
started suffering from Alzheimer's disease.

744
00:32:28.44 --> 00:32:30.44
But it doesn't hurt to be a young officer

745
00:32:30.44 --> 00:32:32.44
who wasn't in Vietnam,

746
00:32:32.44 --> 00:32:32.44
you know,

747
00:32:32.44 --> 00:32:34.44
to have these folks here

748
00:32:34.44 --> 00:32:35.44
who take you under their wing

749
00:32:35.44 --> 00:32:36.44
and teach you.

750
00:32:36.44 --> 00:32:38.44
And,

751
00:32:38.44 --> 00:32:40.44
the best thing that was not necessarily

752
00:32:40.44 --> 00:32:42.44
the operational things,

753
00:32:42.44 --> 00:32:43.44
but I think the thing that I owe them

754
00:32:43.44 --> 00:32:45.44
most for a jacco,

755
00:32:45.44 --> 00:32:47.44
is like a two o'clock in the morning

756
00:32:47.44 --> 00:32:48.44
when they put their armor on me,

757
00:32:48.44 --> 00:32:50.44
say it's time to go home, sir.

758
00:32:50.44 --> 00:32:52.44
Time to go back.

759
00:32:52.44 --> 00:32:53.44
Thank you.

760
00:32:53.44 --> 00:32:55.44
Just the New York kicked in this.

761
00:32:55.44 --> 00:32:56.44
New York comes out around

762
00:32:56.44 --> 00:32:58.44
through a clock at the morning

763
00:32:58.44 --> 00:33:00.44
after X number of beers.

764
00:33:00.44 --> 00:33:02.44
So you did,

765
00:33:02.44 --> 00:33:04.44
so you were married to Kathy

766
00:33:04.44 --> 00:33:06.44
before you went to butts.

767
00:33:06.44 --> 00:33:07.44
Absolutely.

768
00:33:07.44 --> 00:33:08.44
Well, I tell you what,

769
00:33:08.44 --> 00:33:09.44
you know,

770
00:33:09.44 --> 00:33:09.44
you know,

771
00:33:09.44 --> 00:33:10.44
people ask,

772
00:33:10.44 --> 00:33:10.44
well,

773
00:33:10.44 --> 00:33:11.44
you know,

774
00:33:11.44 --> 00:33:12.44
where did you honeymoon?

775
00:33:12.44 --> 00:33:13.44
Or not a California?

776
00:33:13.44 --> 00:33:14.44
Or not a California?

777
00:33:14.44 --> 00:33:15.44
No,

778
00:33:15.44 --> 00:33:16.44
so,

779
00:33:16.44 --> 00:33:19.44
it's kind of interesting.

780
00:33:19.44 --> 00:33:20.44
That, you know,

781
00:33:20.44 --> 00:33:22.44
I was on the ship and we deployed

782
00:33:22.44 --> 00:33:23.44
to the Mediterranean.

783
00:33:23.44 --> 00:33:24.44
I held orders to,

784
00:33:24.44 --> 00:33:25.44
to butts.

785
00:33:25.44 --> 00:33:27.44
And I came home,

786
00:33:27.44 --> 00:33:28.44
flew in on a McFlight

787
00:33:28.44 --> 00:33:29.44
into Philadelphia,

788
00:33:29.44 --> 00:33:31.44
Kathy lived in New Jersey.

789
00:33:31.44 --> 00:33:33.44
And I went to see her first.

790
00:33:33.44 --> 00:33:34.44
Now,

791
00:33:34.44 --> 00:33:35.44
this is a dangerous thing.

792
00:33:35.44 --> 00:33:36.44
Clearly,

793
00:33:36.44 --> 00:33:39.44
I've been overpaid all my life.

794
00:33:39.44 --> 00:33:40.44
And at that point in time,

795
00:33:40.44 --> 00:33:41.44
I was making the Prince

796
00:33:41.44 --> 00:33:43.44
League some of $8,000.

797
00:33:43.44 --> 00:33:44.44
But,

798
00:33:44.44 --> 00:33:45.44
when you,

799
00:33:45.44 --> 00:33:47.44
when you transfer a PCS,

800
00:33:47.44 --> 00:33:49.44
you're able to take

801
00:33:49.44 --> 00:33:51.44
what's called an advanced pay,

802
00:33:51.44 --> 00:33:53.44
which is sort of an interest-free loan,

803
00:33:53.44 --> 00:33:54.44
except,

804
00:33:54.44 --> 00:33:56.44
do you got to pay it back?

805
00:33:56.44 --> 00:33:57.44
So,

806
00:33:57.44 --> 00:33:58.44
I got,

807
00:33:58.44 --> 00:33:59.44
I don't know what I got.

808
00:33:59.44 --> 00:34:00.44
I've probably got a thousand dollars,

809
00:34:00.44 --> 00:34:02.44
twelve hundred dollars or whatever.

810
00:34:02.44 --> 00:34:03.44
So,

811
00:34:03.44 --> 00:34:04.44
now,

812
00:34:04.44 --> 00:34:06.44
in New York,

813
00:34:06.44 --> 00:34:09.44
walking down fifth avenue with my honey,

814
00:34:09.44 --> 00:34:11.44
and we walk into Tiffany's.

815
00:34:11.44 --> 00:34:13.44
And I say,

816
00:34:13.44 --> 00:34:15.44
let's get engaged.

817
00:34:15.44 --> 00:34:16.44
So,

818
00:34:16.44 --> 00:34:17.44
she picks out a ring.

819
00:34:17.44 --> 00:34:19.44
I get engaged in Tiffany's.

820
00:34:19.44 --> 00:34:21.44
We get married two weeks later.

821
00:34:21.44 --> 00:34:22.44
We're going to short honey moon

822
00:34:22.44 --> 00:34:23.44
to,

823
00:34:23.44 --> 00:34:24.44
to a sink Roy.

824
00:34:24.44 --> 00:34:25.44
Come back,

825
00:34:25.44 --> 00:34:26.44
pack up the car,

826
00:34:26.44 --> 00:34:27.44
and drive out to,

827
00:34:27.44 --> 00:34:28.44
to seal training.

828
00:34:28.44 --> 00:34:30.44
And,

829
00:34:30.44 --> 00:34:32.44
it's kind of a shock

830
00:34:32.44 --> 00:34:34.44
when you go off to work one day,

831
00:34:34.44 --> 00:34:35.44
and you come back after

832
00:34:35.44 --> 00:34:37.44
the instructors of shave your head.

833
00:34:37.44 --> 00:34:40.44
What happened to my boy?

834
00:34:40.44 --> 00:34:41.44
You know,

835
00:34:41.44 --> 00:34:42.44
but I won't tell you this.

836
00:34:42.44 --> 00:34:43.44
Now,

837
00:34:43.44 --> 00:34:44.44
I mean,

838
00:34:44.44 --> 00:34:47.44
it was a different thing back then.

839
00:34:47.44 --> 00:34:51.44
People didn't know about seal training,

840
00:34:51.44 --> 00:34:54.44
but it was helpful to me to be married.

841
00:34:54.44 --> 00:34:55.44
And,

842
00:34:55.44 --> 00:34:57.44
during that time frame.

843
00:34:57.44 --> 00:34:58.44
But,

844
00:34:58.44 --> 00:34:59.44
as I said,

845
00:34:59.44 --> 00:35:00.44
later on,

846
00:35:00.44 --> 00:35:01.44
years on,

847
00:35:01.44 --> 00:35:02.44
but we went through so much stuff

848
00:35:02.44 --> 00:35:04.44
that she'd been there from day one.

849
00:35:04.44 --> 00:35:05.44
And she understood the community.

850
00:35:05.44 --> 00:35:07.44
She understood how the community was built.

851
00:35:07.44 --> 00:35:11.44
And people even today rely heavily on her

852
00:35:11.44 --> 00:35:12.44
for that.

853
00:35:12.44 --> 00:35:13.44
But,

854
00:35:13.44 --> 00:35:14.44
yeah,

855
00:35:14.44 --> 00:35:16.44
it's not something I would recommend

856
00:35:16.44 --> 00:35:18.44
for everybody to be honey moon

857
00:35:18.44 --> 00:35:20.44
as you go through seal training.

858
00:35:20.44 --> 00:35:21.44
But,

859
00:35:21.44 --> 00:35:23.44
we did God bless her.

860
00:35:23.44 --> 00:35:24.44
Well,

861
00:35:24.44 --> 00:35:25.44
the thing about it is the

862
00:35:25.44 --> 00:35:27.44
newtherovice idea we're getting into.

863
00:35:27.44 --> 00:35:28.44
You know?

864
00:35:28.44 --> 00:35:28.44
Yeah,

865
00:35:28.44 --> 00:35:29.44
you didn't.

866
00:35:29.44 --> 00:35:32.44
You must have known very little about seal training back then.

867
00:35:32.44 --> 00:35:33.44
Yeah.

868
00:35:33.44 --> 00:35:33.44
I mean,

869
00:35:33.44 --> 00:35:34.44
even I,

870
00:35:34.44 --> 00:35:35.44
when I went through

871
00:35:35.44 --> 00:35:36.44
in 1991,

872
00:35:36.44 --> 00:35:37.44
and I had seen one,

873
00:35:37.44 --> 00:35:38.44
you know,

874
00:35:38.44 --> 00:35:39.44
the B-Summon Special Video.

875
00:35:39.44 --> 00:35:40.44
That's it.

876
00:35:40.44 --> 00:35:42.44
There was no books talking about it.

877
00:35:42.44 --> 00:35:43.44
Now,

878
00:35:43.44 --> 00:35:44.44
I mean,

879
00:35:44.44 --> 00:35:45.44
there's so much information out there.

880
00:35:45.44 --> 00:35:46.44
You can watch all of Buds and,

881
00:35:46.44 --> 00:35:46.44
you know,

882
00:35:46.44 --> 00:35:48.44
guys know what the schedule's going to be and all that.

883
00:35:48.44 --> 00:35:49.44
Yeah.

884
00:35:49.44 --> 00:35:49.44
Back then,

885
00:35:49.44 --> 00:35:50.44
it was just blind.

886
00:35:50.44 --> 00:35:52.44
They just ripped the blindfold off you and

887
00:35:52.44 --> 00:35:53.44
shave your head.

888
00:35:53.44 --> 00:35:54.44
That's it.

889
00:35:54.44 --> 00:35:54.44
Oh, yeah.

890
00:35:54.44 --> 00:35:54.44
So,

891
00:35:54.44 --> 00:35:56.44
fast forward 20 years.

892
00:35:56.44 --> 00:35:57.44
And now,

893
00:35:57.44 --> 00:35:58.44
the commander,

894
00:35:58.44 --> 00:35:59.44
commanding officer of the Naval Special War

895
00:35:59.44 --> 00:36:01.44
for a center of Buds.

896
00:36:01.44 --> 00:36:02.44
So,

897
00:36:02.44 --> 00:36:04.44
Kathy comes to meet me for lunch.

898
00:36:04.44 --> 00:36:06.44
We're going to go out to Coronado

899
00:36:06.44 --> 00:36:07.44
and have some lunch.

900
00:36:07.44 --> 00:36:09.44
And I'm on the telephone.

901
00:36:09.44 --> 00:36:10.44
You know,

902
00:36:10.44 --> 00:36:12.44
she comes to the office and

903
00:36:12.44 --> 00:36:14.44
the secretary says,

904
00:36:14.44 --> 00:36:14.44
you know,

905
00:36:14.44 --> 00:36:16.44
he'll be with you in a few minutes.

906
00:36:16.44 --> 00:36:17.44
So, she's standing on the balcony

907
00:36:17.44 --> 00:36:19.44
overlooking the grinder

908
00:36:19.44 --> 00:36:21.44
as the instructors are

909
00:36:21.44 --> 00:36:22.44
motivating.

910
00:36:22.44 --> 00:36:23.44
But suddenly,

911
00:36:23.44 --> 00:36:24.44
speak.

912
00:36:24.44 --> 00:36:26.44
The first phase class.

913
00:36:26.44 --> 00:36:27.44
Right?

914
00:36:27.44 --> 00:36:28.44
And so,

915
00:36:28.44 --> 00:36:29.44
come out.

916
00:36:29.44 --> 00:36:30.44
Off we go.

917
00:36:30.44 --> 00:36:31.44
You're going to lunch.

918
00:36:31.44 --> 00:36:32.44
Sit there at lunch.

919
00:36:32.44 --> 00:36:33.44
Now, we've been married 20 years.

920
00:36:33.44 --> 00:36:35.44
Went through training with me.

921
00:36:35.44 --> 00:36:36.44
And she said,

922
00:36:36.44 --> 00:36:38.44
I need to ask your question.

923
00:36:38.44 --> 00:36:40.44
Yeah, what sweetheart?

924
00:36:40.44 --> 00:36:42.44
Did you have to do that when you went through training?

925
00:36:42.44 --> 00:36:43.44
No.

926
00:36:43.44 --> 00:36:44.44
I said,

927
00:36:44.44 --> 00:36:45.44
sweetie, even then,

928
00:36:45.44 --> 00:36:46.44
they knew 20 years later

929
00:36:46.44 --> 00:36:48.44
I was going to be the commanding officer of this place.

930
00:36:48.44 --> 00:36:48.44
And then,

931
00:36:48.44 --> 00:36:49.44
of course,

932
00:36:49.44 --> 00:36:50.44
I did that.

933
00:36:50.44 --> 00:36:51.44
I'm so sorry.

934
00:36:51.44 --> 00:36:52.44
Go side, come home.

935
00:36:52.44 --> 00:36:53.44
And she go,

936
00:36:53.44 --> 00:36:54.44
let's go to dinner.

937
00:36:54.44 --> 00:36:55.44
Okay.

938
00:36:55.44 --> 00:36:57.44
So,

939
00:36:57.44 --> 00:36:59.44
how long did you do at UDT?

940
00:36:59.44 --> 00:37:00.44
21?

941
00:37:00.44 --> 00:37:01.44
I did.

942
00:37:01.44 --> 00:37:02.44
I did,

943
00:37:02.44 --> 00:37:04.44
I guess about two and a half years,

944
00:37:04.44 --> 00:37:05.44
maybe three years.

945
00:37:05.44 --> 00:37:07.44
And then back then,

946
00:37:07.44 --> 00:37:10.44
we were for the longest period of time,

947
00:37:10.44 --> 00:37:13.44
just we got decimated after Vietnam.

948
00:37:13.44 --> 00:37:14.44
I mean, that's just UDT,

949
00:37:14.44 --> 00:37:15.44
but the whole community.

950
00:37:15.44 --> 00:37:16.44
So, we all...

951
00:37:16.44 --> 00:37:17.44
The whole Navy,

952
00:37:17.44 --> 00:37:19.44
you know, safe to say the whole Navy and the whole Navy.

953
00:37:19.44 --> 00:37:20.44
They're there after Vietnam?

954
00:37:20.44 --> 00:37:21.44
Yes, that's true.

955
00:37:21.44 --> 00:37:22.44
But then,

956
00:37:22.44 --> 00:37:24.44
the target was Russia.

957
00:37:24.44 --> 00:37:26.44
And we were going to handle Russia with the,

958
00:37:26.44 --> 00:37:28.44
what the nuclear triad got it.

959
00:37:28.44 --> 00:37:29.44
Right?

960
00:37:29.44 --> 00:37:31.44
And so, if you're not part of the nuclear triad,

961
00:37:31.44 --> 00:37:32.44
although,

962
00:37:32.44 --> 00:37:34.44
how is it in a nuclear weapons program at UDT?

963
00:37:34.44 --> 00:37:34.44
I mean,

964
00:37:34.44 --> 00:37:36.44
we had to deliver the B-54S atom.

965
00:37:36.44 --> 00:37:38.44
And so,

966
00:37:38.44 --> 00:37:40.44
we had 306s then.

967
00:37:40.44 --> 00:37:41.44
That's it.

968
00:37:41.44 --> 00:37:43.44
And the three of them got together and decided

969
00:37:43.44 --> 00:37:46.44
that we needed to send some junior officers

970
00:37:46.44 --> 00:37:49.44
out into the fleet as flag lieutenant's.

971
00:37:49.44 --> 00:37:51.44
And so,

972
00:37:51.44 --> 00:37:53.44
now this is always a bad sign.

973
00:37:53.44 --> 00:37:55.44
When I'm deployed down to the Caribbean

974
00:37:55.44 --> 00:37:57.44
and the Exo, Tom Richards.

975
00:37:57.44 --> 00:37:58.44
You'll run up,

976
00:37:58.44 --> 00:38:00.44
Tom Richards comes down to visit,

977
00:38:00.44 --> 00:38:02.44
and this is odd.

978
00:38:02.44 --> 00:38:07.44
The Exo is going to,

979
00:38:07.44 --> 00:38:08.44
so,

980
00:38:08.44 --> 00:38:09.44
he spent the day with this,

981
00:38:09.44 --> 00:38:10.44
doesn't say anything.

982
00:38:10.44 --> 00:38:13.44
And we're flying back up to Norfolk on the C9.

983
00:38:13.44 --> 00:38:15.44
We've got the whole plane to ourselves.

984
00:38:15.44 --> 00:38:16.44
And I'm sitting against the window,

985
00:38:16.44 --> 00:38:19.44
and the Exo comes in system X-DV.

986
00:38:19.44 --> 00:38:20.44
I mean,

987
00:38:20.44 --> 00:38:21.44
now I mean,

988
00:38:21.44 --> 00:38:21.44
like,

989
00:38:21.44 --> 00:38:22.44
I'm a popular guy.

990
00:38:22.44 --> 00:38:23.44
I know that,

991
00:38:23.44 --> 00:38:23.44
but I didn't.

992
00:38:23.44 --> 00:38:25.44
And I think I knew something was up.

993
00:38:25.44 --> 00:38:26.44
He goes,

994
00:38:26.44 --> 00:38:27.44
hey Joe,

995
00:38:27.44 --> 00:38:29.44
have you ever thought about being a flag lieutenant?

996
00:38:29.44 --> 00:38:31.44
No sir.

997
00:38:31.44 --> 00:38:32.44
No,

998
00:38:32.44 --> 00:38:33.44
you're serious to think about that.

999
00:38:33.44 --> 00:38:34.44
No sir.

1000
00:38:34.44 --> 00:38:35.44
You know?

1001
00:38:35.44 --> 00:38:37.44
And I tried to be persuasive to him,

1002
00:38:37.44 --> 00:38:37.44
I said,

1003
00:38:37.44 --> 00:38:38.44
look,

1004
00:38:38.44 --> 00:38:39.44
I was in the fleet for a couple of years.

1005
00:38:39.44 --> 00:38:40.44
I'm in UDT right now.

1006
00:38:40.44 --> 00:38:41.44
I need to get,

1007
00:38:41.44 --> 00:38:41.44
you know,

1008
00:38:41.44 --> 00:38:43.44
after this I got to go to a sealed team.

1009
00:38:43.44 --> 00:38:44.44
He says,

1010
00:38:44.44 --> 00:38:44.44
well,

1011
00:38:44.44 --> 00:38:46.44
the Commodore wants to see you tomorrow.

1012
00:38:46.44 --> 00:38:47.44
All right?

1013
00:38:47.44 --> 00:38:48.44
This was Storm and Norman Olson,

1014
00:38:48.44 --> 00:38:50.44
who got bus and we just had a memorial service for Norman.

1015
00:38:50.44 --> 00:38:51.44
And really,

1016
00:38:51.44 --> 00:38:53.44
he's one of the guys that shaped this.

1017
00:38:53.44 --> 00:38:54.44
He said,

1018
00:38:54.44 --> 00:38:55.44
you're going to be a flag lieutenant,

1019
00:38:55.44 --> 00:38:55.44
it's a simple,

1020
00:38:55.44 --> 00:38:56.44
is that,

1021
00:38:56.44 --> 00:38:56.44
yes,

1022
00:38:56.44 --> 00:38:57.44
commoner.

1023
00:38:57.44 --> 00:38:58.44
So,

1024
00:38:58.44 --> 00:38:59.44
I wanted to go into Japan

1025
00:38:59.44 --> 00:39:00.44
as a flag lieutenant.

1026
00:39:00.44 --> 00:39:02.44
And wound up working for the first

1027
00:39:02.44 --> 00:39:05.44
admiral that made a helicopter pilot that made

1028
00:39:05.44 --> 00:39:07.44
admiral.

1029
00:39:07.44 --> 00:39:09.44
And he made all of the appolarry companies.

1030
00:39:09.44 --> 00:39:14.44
And every day was a space mission for me with this guy here.

1031
00:39:14.44 --> 00:39:17.44
It had to be exacting an enemy.

1032
00:39:17.44 --> 00:39:18.44
And,

1033
00:39:18.44 --> 00:39:19.44
you know,

1034
00:39:19.44 --> 00:39:20.44
when driver long one day,

1035
00:39:20.44 --> 00:39:21.44
and he goes,

1036
00:39:21.44 --> 00:39:24.44
I'm going to make you the best flag lieutenant

1037
00:39:24.44 --> 00:39:25.44
in seven fleets,

1038
00:39:25.44 --> 00:39:27.44
even if it kills you.

1039
00:39:27.44 --> 00:39:29.44
I turned to my ghost,

1040
00:39:29.44 --> 00:39:31.44
so you're going to be a great soldier.

1041
00:39:31.44 --> 00:39:33.44
But I will tell you this.

1042
00:39:33.44 --> 00:39:35.44
You learn.

1043
00:39:35.44 --> 00:39:36.44
You learn.

1044
00:39:36.44 --> 00:39:37.44
As you know,

1045
00:39:37.44 --> 00:39:38.44
you learn.

1046
00:39:38.44 --> 00:39:41.44
But the interesting thing is,

1047
00:39:41.44 --> 00:39:42.44
now,

1048
00:39:42.44 --> 00:39:45.44
I adured myself to all of the animals out there.

1049
00:39:45.44 --> 00:39:48.44
And we had the fleet readiness board up in Yakuza,

1050
00:39:48.44 --> 00:39:50.44
hosted by the seven fleet commander.

1051
00:39:50.44 --> 00:39:53.44
So, it's about 13, 14 animals there.

1052
00:39:53.44 --> 00:39:55.44
And a breakfast,

1053
00:39:55.44 --> 00:39:55.44
you know,

1054
00:39:55.44 --> 00:39:56.44
they sit there together,

1055
00:39:56.44 --> 00:39:57.44
and all of us,

1056
00:39:57.44 --> 00:39:58.44
you know,

1057
00:39:58.44 --> 00:39:59.44
all of us,

1058
00:39:59.44 --> 00:40:00.44
bad carriers,

1059
00:40:00.44 --> 00:40:01.44
we go off to the side.

1060
00:40:01.44 --> 00:40:03.44
And as I'm walking by with my tray,

1061
00:40:03.44 --> 00:40:04.44
the fleet commander goes,

1062
00:40:04.44 --> 00:40:04.44
hey Joe,

1063
00:40:04.44 --> 00:40:06.44
come join us.

1064
00:40:06.44 --> 00:40:08.44
It would be an honor.

1065
00:40:08.44 --> 00:40:10.44
You know what?

1066
00:40:10.44 --> 00:40:12.44
What's wrong with this picture, right?

1067
00:40:12.44 --> 00:40:13.44
So,

1068
00:40:13.44 --> 00:40:14.44
they went around the table,

1069
00:40:14.44 --> 00:40:16.44
and they were telling me that,

1070
00:40:16.44 --> 00:40:18.44
and this was really true with the time.

1071
00:40:18.44 --> 00:40:21.44
You can't go back to Seal team right now.

1072
00:40:21.44 --> 00:40:23.44
Your surface warfare officer,

1073
00:40:23.44 --> 00:40:25.44
you've got tremendous potential.

1074
00:40:25.44 --> 00:40:27.44
If you go back into the Seal teams,

1075
00:40:27.44 --> 00:40:28.44
you will never,

1076
00:40:28.44 --> 00:40:29.44
ever,

1077
00:40:29.44 --> 00:40:31.44
ever get promoted.

1078
00:40:31.44 --> 00:40:33.44
This was in 1981.

1079
00:40:33.44 --> 00:40:34.44
And true,

1080
00:40:34.44 --> 00:40:35.44
at that time,

1081
00:40:35.44 --> 00:40:38.44
most of the commanding officers of Seal teams

1082
00:40:38.44 --> 00:40:40.44
will lieutenant commanders passed over for commander.

1083
00:40:40.44 --> 00:40:42.44
We only had a handful of captains,

1084
00:40:42.44 --> 00:40:44.44
and there was no real career path,

1085
00:40:44.44 --> 00:40:45.44
you know, for that.

1086
00:40:45.44 --> 00:40:47.44
But I told him, I said,

1087
00:40:47.44 --> 00:40:48.44
well,

1088
00:40:48.44 --> 00:40:49.44
look,

1089
00:40:49.44 --> 00:40:50.44
I'm going.

1090
00:40:50.44 --> 00:40:52.44
And the only advice they gave me then,

1091
00:40:52.44 --> 00:40:52.44
well,

1092
00:40:52.44 --> 00:40:53.44
go to PG school.

1093
00:40:53.44 --> 00:40:54.44
Okay.

1094
00:40:54.44 --> 00:40:56.44
That was a good trade-off.

1095
00:40:56.44 --> 00:40:58.44
But that was true at that time.

1096
00:40:58.44 --> 00:40:59.44
And, you know,

1097
00:40:59.44 --> 00:41:01.44
backing up a little bit about my father

1098
00:41:01.44 --> 00:41:03.44
being a Colonel in the Reserves.

1099
00:41:03.44 --> 00:41:05.44
He said the same thing back then,

1100
00:41:05.44 --> 00:41:06.44
that,

1101
00:41:06.44 --> 00:41:07.44
you know,

1102
00:41:07.44 --> 00:41:09.44
you'll have a couple of good years.

1103
00:41:09.44 --> 00:41:10.44
But, you know,

1104
00:41:10.44 --> 00:41:11.44
you'll never,

1105
00:41:11.44 --> 00:41:13.44
never be promoted past lieutenant commander.

1106
00:41:13.44 --> 00:41:14.44
It's as simple as that.

1107
00:41:14.44 --> 00:41:15.44
And, you know,

1108
00:41:15.44 --> 00:41:17.44
I went to his grave one time,

1109
00:41:17.44 --> 00:41:20.44
and put my three stars shoulder boards on his,

1110
00:41:20.44 --> 00:41:22.44
what is student style?

1111
00:41:22.44 --> 00:41:24.44
So that's,

1112
00:41:24.44 --> 00:41:26.44
how long you doing that?

1113
00:41:26.44 --> 00:41:28.44
How long you doing that job is the aid?

1114
00:41:28.44 --> 00:41:29.44
The flag aid.

1115
00:41:29.44 --> 00:41:30.44
100 years.

1116
00:41:30.44 --> 00:41:32.44
I know the feeling.

1117
00:41:32.44 --> 00:41:34.44
No, I was 25 months,

1118
00:41:34.44 --> 00:41:35.44
but I will tell you.

1119
00:41:35.44 --> 00:41:36.44
Oh, I'll tell you.

1120
00:41:36.44 --> 00:41:38.44
Jacob, one of the best things about that,

1121
00:41:38.44 --> 00:41:39.44
I mean, this is surely,

1122
00:41:39.44 --> 00:41:43.44
is that I was the aid for CTF 76,

1123
00:41:43.44 --> 00:41:45.44
and a young,

1124
00:41:45.44 --> 00:41:45.44
a,

1125
00:41:45.44 --> 00:41:46.44
a,

1126
00:41:46.44 --> 00:41:47.44
a first lieutenant,

1127
00:41:47.44 --> 00:41:49.44
named Joe Dunford,

1128
00:41:49.44 --> 00:41:51.44
was the aid for CTF 79.

1129
00:41:51.44 --> 00:41:52.44
And,

1130
00:41:52.44 --> 00:41:54.44
and Joe and I spent 25 months together,

1131
00:41:54.44 --> 00:41:55.44
you look at the traffic,

1132
00:41:55.44 --> 00:41:57.44
traveling everywhere together.

1133
00:41:57.44 --> 00:42:00.44
And then after we both finish that tour,

1134
00:42:00.44 --> 00:42:01.44
you know,

1135
00:42:01.44 --> 00:42:02.44
Joe's during the course of our careers,

1136
00:42:02.44 --> 00:42:04.44
we stayed close.

1137
00:42:04.44 --> 00:42:05.44
And,

1138
00:42:05.44 --> 00:42:06.44
you know,

1139
00:42:06.44 --> 00:42:07.44
we'd see each other on deployment.

1140
00:42:07.44 --> 00:42:09.44
He's a battalion commander.

1141
00:42:09.44 --> 00:42:10.44
He wound up,

1142
00:42:10.44 --> 00:42:10.44
you know,

1143
00:42:10.44 --> 00:42:12.44
being the speech writer for the commandant,

1144
00:42:12.44 --> 00:42:16.44
and a lot of other jobs that it will deserve.

1145
00:42:16.44 --> 00:42:19.44
But it was actually Joe Dunford,

1146
00:42:19.44 --> 00:42:21.44
and Jim Mattis,

1147
00:42:21.44 --> 00:42:23.44
that asked me to come back into government.

1148
00:42:23.44 --> 00:42:24.44
And,

1149
00:42:24.44 --> 00:42:26.44
I hate them both for that.

1150
00:42:26.44 --> 00:42:28.44
No,

1151
00:42:28.44 --> 00:42:29.44
but,

1152
00:42:29.44 --> 00:42:29.44
but,

1153
00:42:29.44 --> 00:42:31.44
the thing about it is with both those goes of two men

1154
00:42:31.44 --> 00:42:33.44
that I hold in the very highest esteem.

1155
00:42:33.44 --> 00:42:35.44
And also figured,

1156
00:42:35.44 --> 00:42:35.44
well,

1157
00:42:35.44 --> 00:42:36.44
you know,

1158
00:42:36.44 --> 00:42:37.44
Joe,

1159
00:42:37.44 --> 00:42:38.44
General Mattis,

1160
00:42:38.44 --> 00:42:40.44
the Secretary Mattis came back into government,

1161
00:42:40.44 --> 00:42:42.44
and Joe's been there for 39 years,

1162
00:42:42.44 --> 00:42:43.44
and, you know,

1163
00:42:43.44 --> 00:42:44.44
I just said to them,

1164
00:42:44.44 --> 00:42:45.44
well,

1165
00:42:45.44 --> 00:42:46.44
if you guys do take a one for the team,

1166
00:42:46.44 --> 00:42:47.44
I'll give it a go.

1167
00:42:47.44 --> 00:42:48.44
I mean,

1168
00:42:48.44 --> 00:42:49.44
we'll see how it goes,

1169
00:42:49.44 --> 00:42:51.44
but I just could not say no to those two men,

1170
00:42:51.44 --> 00:42:52.44
but just want an honor,

1171
00:42:52.44 --> 00:42:55.44
and then to actually get into the administration,

1172
00:42:55.44 --> 00:42:57.44
and be the director of National Intelligence,

1173
00:42:57.44 --> 00:43:00.44
sitting at the National Security Council meeting,

1174
00:43:00.44 --> 00:43:02.44
with Joe Dunford to my right.

1175
00:43:02.44 --> 00:43:03.44
It's just, you know,

1176
00:43:03.44 --> 00:43:04.44
you just,

1177
00:43:04.44 --> 00:43:05.44
it's a small world,

1178
00:43:05.44 --> 00:43:06.44
and you just don't know.

1179
00:43:06.44 --> 00:43:07.44
But yeah.

1180
00:43:07.44 --> 00:43:09.44
But you didn't take their advice,

1181
00:43:09.44 --> 00:43:10.44
and you did go back to the field team.

1182
00:43:10.44 --> 00:43:11.44
That was your next one.

1183
00:43:11.44 --> 00:43:12.44
I did.

1184
00:43:12.44 --> 00:43:12.44
I did,

1185
00:43:12.44 --> 00:43:13.44
as a matter of fact,

1186
00:43:13.44 --> 00:43:14.44
and,

1187
00:43:14.44 --> 00:43:15.44
you know,

1188
00:43:15.44 --> 00:43:16.44
so the journey continues.

1189
00:43:16.44 --> 00:43:17.44
So I went into,

1190
00:43:17.44 --> 00:43:18.44
to see a team too,

1191
00:43:18.44 --> 00:43:20.44
and at that time,

1192
00:43:20.44 --> 00:43:23.44
a commander Rick Woolard

1193
00:43:23.44 --> 00:43:26.44
was the commanding officer of the team too.

1194
00:43:26.44 --> 00:43:27.44
And rightfully so,

1195
00:43:27.44 --> 00:43:30.44
he wanted to develop an undecided capability.

1196
00:43:30.44 --> 00:43:33.44
So we wound up,

1197
00:43:33.44 --> 00:43:34.44
now,

1198
00:43:34.44 --> 00:43:36.44
to be honest with you back then,

1199
00:43:36.44 --> 00:43:38.44
we were not very good.

1200
00:43:38.44 --> 00:43:39.44
We had good swimmers.

1201
00:43:39.44 --> 00:43:40.44
We had good athletes.

1202
00:43:40.44 --> 00:43:42.44
We had a rotten equipment.

1203
00:43:42.44 --> 00:43:44.44
We didn't have techniques and procedures.

1204
00:43:44.44 --> 00:43:47.44
We really didn't know what we didn't know.

1205
00:43:47.44 --> 00:43:50.44
And Rick through our senior officers

1206
00:43:50.44 --> 00:43:52.44
and the chief and naval operations,

1207
00:43:52.44 --> 00:43:55.44
were able to establish a personal exchange program,

1208
00:43:55.44 --> 00:43:56.44
pep pellet,

1209
00:43:56.44 --> 00:44:01.44
and bring over a French commando from Commander Ubehr.

1210
00:44:01.44 --> 00:44:02.44
And in my estimation,

1211
00:44:02.44 --> 00:44:03.44
Commander Ubehr,

1212
00:44:03.44 --> 00:44:06.44
the best combat divers in the world,

1213
00:44:06.44 --> 00:44:08.44
military combat divers.

1214
00:44:08.44 --> 00:44:09.44
And,

1215
00:44:09.44 --> 00:44:12.44
Francois was charged with establishing

1216
00:44:12.44 --> 00:44:15.44
a combat swimmer program.

1217
00:44:15.44 --> 00:44:17.44
That, to this day,

1218
00:44:17.44 --> 00:44:20.44
was the most dangerous program

1219
00:44:20.44 --> 00:44:22.44
that I'd ever been through.

1220
00:44:22.44 --> 00:44:24.44
And,

1221
00:44:24.44 --> 00:44:26.44
extremely high atrition rates.

1222
00:44:26.44 --> 00:44:27.44
But not everybody could do it,

1223
00:44:27.44 --> 00:44:29.44
but not everybody could swim oxygen either.

1224
00:44:29.44 --> 00:44:31.44
But in addition to that program,

1225
00:44:31.44 --> 00:44:32.44
Rick also,

1226
00:44:32.44 --> 00:44:34.44
looking back on this,

1227
00:44:34.44 --> 00:44:35.44
it seems hard to believe,

1228
00:44:35.44 --> 00:44:38.44
get permission to buy foreign sales,

1229
00:44:38.44 --> 00:44:39.44
things.

1230
00:44:39.44 --> 00:44:40.44
So we were able to,

1231
00:44:40.44 --> 00:44:41.44
we were able to,

1232
00:44:41.44 --> 00:44:42.44
we were the first was to get the trigger.

1233
00:44:42.44 --> 00:44:43.44
So the German.

1234
00:44:43.44 --> 00:44:45.44
And we helped the trigger live jackets French.

1235
00:44:45.44 --> 00:44:47.44
And there was a prohibition against that

1236
00:44:47.44 --> 00:44:48.44
because we'd buy American,

1237
00:44:48.44 --> 00:44:50.44
but it was the best technical

1238
00:44:50.44 --> 00:44:53.44
undecide combat swimmer stuff that we had.

1239
00:44:53.44 --> 00:44:57.44
And we did extremely hard work up,

1240
00:44:57.44 --> 00:44:58.44
and I was just,

1241
00:44:58.44 --> 00:44:59.44
most fortunate that,

1242
00:44:59.44 --> 00:45:00.44
you know,

1243
00:45:00.44 --> 00:45:02.44
I had a department head tour there,

1244
00:45:02.44 --> 00:45:03.44
and then,

1245
00:45:03.44 --> 00:45:05.44
a platoon commander,

1246
00:45:05.44 --> 00:45:08.44
and in October of

1247
00:45:08.44 --> 00:45:11.44
1982,

1248
00:45:11.44 --> 00:45:14.44
we just got fast ropes.

1249
00:45:14.44 --> 00:45:16.44
So hard to believe,

1250
00:45:16.44 --> 00:45:18.44
and fast ropes were classified in

1251
00:45:18.44 --> 00:45:19.44
insertion means.

1252
00:45:19.44 --> 00:45:21.44
And we got it from the British,

1253
00:45:21.44 --> 00:45:22.44
I'll say yes,

1254
00:45:22.44 --> 00:45:23.44
used.

1255
00:45:23.44 --> 00:45:26.44
And I spent the night not a fortune.

1256
00:45:26.44 --> 00:45:29.44
So we're up in AP Hill,

1257
00:45:29.44 --> 00:45:31.44
and Rudy Bosch,

1258
00:45:31.44 --> 00:45:33.44
brings the rope up.

1259
00:45:33.44 --> 00:45:34.44
We got a helicopter,

1260
00:45:34.44 --> 00:45:36.44
and we're doing,

1261
00:45:36.44 --> 00:45:39.44
first we're doing Rudy is the repell master.

1262
00:45:39.44 --> 00:45:40.44
He's the rope master.

1263
00:45:40.44 --> 00:45:42.44
Talks to us about this.

1264
00:45:42.44 --> 00:45:44.44
And now I used to be on the ship,

1265
00:45:44.44 --> 00:45:45.44
you know,

1266
00:45:45.44 --> 00:45:46.44
as a deck officer.

1267
00:45:46.44 --> 00:45:47.44
So I know lines and stuff.

1268
00:45:47.44 --> 00:45:48.44
So I said,

1269
00:45:48.44 --> 00:45:49.44
Rudy,

1270
00:45:49.44 --> 00:45:50.44
what's the tenthsl strength in this?

1271
00:45:50.44 --> 00:45:51.44
How many can hold?

1272
00:45:51.44 --> 00:45:52.44
Add the worry about a son,

1273
00:45:52.44 --> 00:45:54.44
what's your whole platoon for Cadet,

1274
00:45:54.44 --> 00:45:55.44
you know?

1275
00:45:55.44 --> 00:45:57.44
That was Rudy, right?

1276
00:45:57.44 --> 00:45:58.44
So,

1277
00:45:58.44 --> 00:45:59.44
now Rudy,

1278
00:45:59.44 --> 00:46:00.44
at this point,

1279
00:46:00.44 --> 00:46:02.44
he's probably knocking at the door in his 60.

1280
00:46:02.44 --> 00:46:04.44
So we did a couple of runs,

1281
00:46:04.44 --> 00:46:05.44
and he's the first one out.

1282
00:46:05.44 --> 00:46:09.44
And then after about four or five runs,

1283
00:46:09.44 --> 00:46:10.44
I just say,

1284
00:46:10.44 --> 00:46:12.44
he must have achieved this isn't too damn hard.

1285
00:46:12.44 --> 00:46:12.44
You know,

1286
00:46:12.44 --> 00:46:14.44
we could figure out how to curl a rope

1287
00:46:14.44 --> 00:46:16.44
and throw it out with a helicopter flares.

1288
00:46:16.44 --> 00:46:17.44
All right?

1289
00:46:17.44 --> 00:46:19.44
So he sits this one out.

1290
00:46:19.44 --> 00:46:21.44
And so my chief,

1291
00:46:21.44 --> 00:46:22.44
but Denny,

1292
00:46:22.44 --> 00:46:23.44
is going to do it.

1293
00:46:23.44 --> 00:46:24.44
I'm following bud,

1294
00:46:24.44 --> 00:46:28.44
and I've got four or five knuckleheads behind me.

1295
00:46:28.44 --> 00:46:31.44
And we go out

1296
00:46:31.44 --> 00:46:33.44
and for some reason or another,

1297
00:46:33.44 --> 00:46:35.44
you know,

1298
00:46:35.44 --> 00:46:37.44
the operative word is fast rope.

1299
00:46:37.44 --> 00:46:39.44
So he just kind of going slow.

1300
00:46:39.44 --> 00:46:41.44
And that all of a sudden,

1301
00:46:41.44 --> 00:46:43.44
I don't know what was going on.

1302
00:46:43.44 --> 00:46:45.44
I thought the helicopter was crashing.

1303
00:46:45.44 --> 00:46:48.44
And I just knew that I was in free fall.

1304
00:46:48.44 --> 00:46:49.44
And you know,

1305
00:46:49.44 --> 00:46:50.44
getting back into fort betting,

1306
00:46:50.44 --> 00:46:52.44
I kind of criticized a little bit there.

1307
00:46:52.44 --> 00:46:54.44
But the thing that saved me

1308
00:46:54.44 --> 00:46:56.44
is just going to a good PLF.

1309
00:46:56.44 --> 00:46:58.44
I put my legs together.

1310
00:46:58.44 --> 00:46:59.44
I put my arms in.

1311
00:46:59.44 --> 00:47:01.44
And for one brief second,

1312
00:47:01.44 --> 00:47:04.44
I avoided the chief below me.

1313
00:47:04.44 --> 00:47:05.44
And I hit.

1314
00:47:05.44 --> 00:47:06.44
And for one nanosecond,

1315
00:47:06.44 --> 00:47:07.44
I go,

1316
00:47:07.44 --> 00:47:08.44
I'm good.

1317
00:47:08.44 --> 00:47:10.44
Then I had five big frogmen land on top.

1318
00:47:10.44 --> 00:47:12.44
So I broke my back,

1319
00:47:12.44 --> 00:47:14.44
and I broke my pelvis.

1320
00:47:14.44 --> 00:47:16.44
So we're all lying there

1321
00:47:16.44 --> 00:47:19.44
as a bunch of red dogs.

1322
00:47:19.44 --> 00:47:20.44
And it's dead silence.

1323
00:47:20.44 --> 00:47:21.44
I still don't know what happened.

1324
00:47:21.44 --> 00:47:23.44
So obviously with the rope broke,

1325
00:47:23.44 --> 00:47:25.44
the helicopter went up

1326
00:47:25.44 --> 00:47:27.44
because no longer had that weight.

1327
00:47:27.44 --> 00:47:29.44
And then he just flared it and went off.

1328
00:47:29.44 --> 00:47:31.44
But all I could hear then was,

1329
00:47:31.44 --> 00:47:33.44
you know, my teammates, my platoon.

1330
00:47:33.44 --> 00:47:36.44
Everybody just kind of quietly moaning.

1331
00:47:36.44 --> 00:47:38.44
And I just said to the guys,

1332
00:47:38.44 --> 00:47:40.44
don't anybody move.

1333
00:47:40.44 --> 00:47:41.44
Right?

1334
00:47:41.44 --> 00:47:42.44
And then he goes,

1335
00:47:42.44 --> 00:47:43.44
Mr. McGuire,

1336
00:47:43.44 --> 00:47:44.44
we can.

1337
00:47:44.44 --> 00:47:45.44
You know?

1338
00:47:45.44 --> 00:47:46.44
And then obviously I realized,

1339
00:47:46.44 --> 00:47:48.44
I can't move my legs.

1340
00:47:48.44 --> 00:47:52.44
And so typical back then,

1341
00:47:52.44 --> 00:47:55.44
our ambulance was a nine passenger van.

1342
00:47:55.44 --> 00:47:58.44
And the only thing we had on the only thing we had

1343
00:47:58.44 --> 00:48:01.44
on the LZ was one body board.

1344
00:48:01.44 --> 00:48:02.44
You know?

1345
00:48:02.44 --> 00:48:04.44
So we had to have the ambulances come in.

1346
00:48:04.44 --> 00:48:08.44
So I got rigor taped to the body board.

1347
00:48:08.44 --> 00:48:10.44
You know, with your head down and just to,

1348
00:48:10.44 --> 00:48:12.44
so that your spine's not moving,

1349
00:48:12.44 --> 00:48:14.44
but every time they moved you,

1350
00:48:14.44 --> 00:48:15.44
it was like with the pelvic,

1351
00:48:15.44 --> 00:48:17.44
it was like cracking your knuckles.

1352
00:48:17.44 --> 00:48:19.44
You know, you could hear.

1353
00:48:19.44 --> 00:48:20.44
You know?

1354
00:48:20.44 --> 00:48:22.44
And then the helicopter goes back in this land.

1355
00:48:22.44 --> 00:48:25.44
So the Colonel from AP Hillcums,

1356
00:48:25.44 --> 00:48:28.44
and typical back then, we never told them we were doing aerops,

1357
00:48:28.44 --> 00:48:31.44
which he did not think was a good idea.

1358
00:48:31.44 --> 00:48:35.44
But he directed the helicopter pilot to take us to Mary Washington,

1359
00:48:35.44 --> 00:48:37.44
a hospital, which is close up there,

1360
00:48:37.44 --> 00:48:40.44
not closest to closest to trauma hospital.

1361
00:48:40.44 --> 00:48:44.44
And so there were five of us loaded into the helicopter.

1362
00:48:44.44 --> 00:48:45.44
And you know,

1363
00:48:45.44 --> 00:48:47.44
the Kamaloo Channet, these guys,

1364
00:48:47.44 --> 00:48:50.44
Lutenets, and I said the pilot command,

1365
00:48:50.44 --> 00:48:51.44
you know, me, well,

1366
00:48:51.44 --> 00:48:52.44
I'm strapped to the body board.

1367
00:48:52.44 --> 00:48:54.44
They said, take us home.

1368
00:48:54.44 --> 00:48:56.44
As the take us to Porsmith,

1369
00:48:56.44 --> 00:48:58.44
I said, we're going to be in a hospital for a long time.

1370
00:48:58.44 --> 00:49:00.44
I said, I don't mind how my wife,

1371
00:49:00.44 --> 00:49:02.44
in what motel, I said,

1372
00:49:02.44 --> 00:49:04.44
you know, just going to take a little bit more,

1373
00:49:04.44 --> 00:49:06.44
but take us to Porsmith, they will hospital.

1374
00:49:06.44 --> 00:49:07.44
So we flew there,

1375
00:49:07.44 --> 00:49:10.44
and you know, we got taken in and taken off.

1376
00:49:10.44 --> 00:49:14.44
And they cut your uniform off and do all such stuff.

1377
00:49:14.44 --> 00:49:17.44
But as we're waiting for X-rays,

1378
00:49:17.44 --> 00:49:20.44
we were all in this little waiting room together.

1379
00:49:20.44 --> 00:49:22.44
The other guys in wheelchairs,

1380
00:49:22.44 --> 00:49:24.44
and you know, there were two of us with broken backs.

1381
00:49:24.44 --> 00:49:28.44
And one guy, Kevin Blake,

1382
00:49:28.44 --> 00:49:31.44
Kevin wound up breaking both of his legs.

1383
00:49:31.44 --> 00:49:33.44
But when he came down,

1384
00:49:33.44 --> 00:49:35.44
he then hit,

1385
00:49:35.44 --> 00:49:38.44
but his face went into his knees.

1386
00:49:38.44 --> 00:49:41.44
And we still didn't know what was what.

1387
00:49:41.44 --> 00:49:45.44
So we had one corpsman from the hospital helping us out.

1388
00:49:45.44 --> 00:49:47.44
And Kevin says,

1389
00:49:47.44 --> 00:49:48.44
man,

1390
00:49:48.44 --> 00:49:50.44
I might know who's this is so stuffy.

1391
00:49:50.44 --> 00:49:52.44
He says, hey, doc, do you have a tissue?

1392
00:49:52.44 --> 00:49:53.44
Can I have a tissue?

1393
00:49:53.44 --> 00:49:55.44
So the corpsman gets a tissue

1394
00:49:55.44 --> 00:49:58.44
and Kevin blows his nose,

1395
00:49:58.44 --> 00:50:00.44
but he broke all of his sinuses in his face.

1396
00:50:00.44 --> 00:50:05.44
His whole face came away from the skull.

1397
00:50:05.44 --> 00:50:08.44
And we're all laughing like her.

1398
00:50:08.44 --> 00:50:15.44
And the corpsman just running out of the sweat.

1399
00:50:15.44 --> 00:50:18.44
And we was like a Jim Carrey movie there.

1400
00:50:18.44 --> 00:50:20.44
His face is out there.

1401
00:50:20.44 --> 00:50:22.44
We got broken bones and broken backs.

1402
00:50:22.44 --> 00:50:24.44
We're all laughing.

1403
00:50:24.44 --> 00:50:26.44
You know, always look for the price side of life.

1404
00:50:26.44 --> 00:50:28.44
Right.

1405
00:50:28.44 --> 00:50:30.44
So whatever we want to eventually was able to heal up.

1406
00:50:30.44 --> 00:50:32.44
No permanent injuries.

1407
00:50:32.44 --> 00:50:34.44
No, no, so a couple of those guys left.

1408
00:50:34.44 --> 00:50:36.44
It was a different time back then.

1409
00:50:36.44 --> 00:50:42.44
I'm sorry to say that I wound up being admitted into an officer room

1410
00:50:42.44 --> 00:50:45.44
with some retired Navy captain.

1411
00:50:45.44 --> 00:50:48.44
But the troops wound up being on a ward.

1412
00:50:48.44 --> 00:50:54.44
And there were probably 20 patients on the ward

1413
00:50:54.44 --> 00:50:58.44
to include some sailor who had been an emoticycle accident

1414
00:50:58.44 --> 00:51:00.44
and he's on a rotisserie.

1415
00:51:00.44 --> 00:51:03.44
But it's pretty much a death watch.

1416
00:51:03.44 --> 00:51:07.44
So George M. McRaven and Kathy,

1417
00:51:07.44 --> 00:51:11.44
the two of them were the very best of friends.

1418
00:51:11.44 --> 00:51:14.44
And you know, Bill and I are best of friends.

1419
00:51:14.44 --> 00:51:16.44
And they come to visit me.

1420
00:51:16.44 --> 00:51:19.44
And now Kathy is of course with me the whole time in Georgia.

1421
00:51:19.44 --> 00:51:20.44
I said, hey, do me a favor.

1422
00:51:20.44 --> 00:51:22.44
I can't get out of bed.

1423
00:51:22.44 --> 00:51:24.44
Would you go down and check on the guys and see how they're doing?

1424
00:51:24.44 --> 00:51:26.44
So they went down.

1425
00:51:26.44 --> 00:51:35.44
And Kevin Blake is in traction with two hairdryers on his cast.

1426
00:51:35.44 --> 00:51:40.44
And Kathy said, Kevin, what are you doing?

1427
00:51:40.44 --> 00:51:43.44
The doctor said I could get out of here as soon as my cast's strong.

1428
00:51:43.44 --> 00:51:46.44
But neither of them had been washed.

1429
00:51:46.44 --> 00:51:49.44
So we've been in the field for eight to ten days.

1430
00:51:49.44 --> 00:51:52.44
They had camouflage on them, your hair.

1431
00:51:52.44 --> 00:51:57.44
So I mean, these are two sailors, mother's sons.

1432
00:51:57.44 --> 00:52:00.44
They've been in the hospital for a couple of days.

1433
00:52:00.44 --> 00:52:02.44
And they've still got them added hair.

1434
00:52:02.44 --> 00:52:06.44
And so Kathy and George M. McRaven, you know,

1435
00:52:06.44 --> 00:52:09.44
got shampooed the guys.

1436
00:52:09.44 --> 00:52:13.44
Watch their camouflage off them.

1437
00:52:13.44 --> 00:52:16.44
And you know, just do what you need to do for a fellow teammate.

1438
00:52:16.44 --> 00:52:25.44
And you know, I'm glad to say, you know, when I've been in the hospital since then, unfortunately.

1439
00:52:25.44 --> 00:52:29.44
And Navy medicine is really supportive now.

1440
00:52:29.44 --> 00:52:33.44
But it was again, once again, after Vietnam, with the entire military suffering.

1441
00:52:33.44 --> 00:52:43.44
But I deployed that was in Halloween of 82, and I deployed to Europe in March of 83, five months later.

1442
00:52:43.44 --> 00:52:46.44
And jumped into McRaven, his Scotland.

1443
00:52:46.44 --> 00:52:53.44
And then also conducted a major exercise, a flintlock exercise with my swim partner, Chuck Williams.

1444
00:52:53.44 --> 00:52:59.44
And from a U-boat, you term in U-209, that we, you know, we,

1445
00:52:59.44 --> 00:53:05.44
was a, so we had to lock in a lock out through the German torpedo tube, which was an excellent adventure.

1446
00:53:05.44 --> 00:53:07.44
It's not for everybody.

1447
00:53:07.44 --> 00:53:13.44
But when we left the submarine, we were in the one of the 13 hours in the Baltic.

1448
00:53:13.44 --> 00:53:21.44
So this is in, you know, late March or early April of 83, that surface temperature was 39 degrees.

1449
00:53:21.44 --> 00:53:23.44
But obviously, we'd down about 10 feet.

1450
00:53:23.44 --> 00:53:28.44
And you know, it's just really glad that, you know, I had an Olympic and towing me.

1451
00:53:28.44 --> 00:53:34.44
But, you know, we were able to do everything that, you know, we were taught to do.

1452
00:53:34.44 --> 00:53:38.44
And the two Americans, one Paris successfully completed the mission.

1453
00:53:38.44 --> 00:53:42.44
And the Germans, who, the conference room, were very, very good.

1454
00:53:42.44 --> 00:53:46.44
So I mean, neither this one pair, we were able to do it.

1455
00:53:46.44 --> 00:53:51.44
Once one pair wound up, but not finding the harbor and wound up in the hospital with hypothermia.

1456
00:53:51.44 --> 00:53:53.44
And the other one pair bailed.

1457
00:53:53.44 --> 00:54:01.44
And it was really kind of a defining thing for the seal community to be able to just say, you know, we did that.

1458
00:54:01.44 --> 00:54:03.44
But the Germans couldn't speak English.

1459
00:54:03.44 --> 00:54:08.44
And I couldn't speak German to be able to do lock out from a German torpedo tube.

1460
00:54:08.44 --> 00:54:12.44
Yeah, something got lost in translation a couple of times.

1461
00:54:12.44 --> 00:54:14.44
And you were diving triggers.

1462
00:54:14.44 --> 00:54:15.44
Yeah.

1463
00:54:15.44 --> 00:54:17.44
Man, and so that's like eight, yeah.

1464
00:54:17.44 --> 00:54:20.44
So the wet suits back then were junk.

1465
00:54:20.44 --> 00:54:24.44
So I grew up surfing in Maine and I had saved all the water.

1466
00:54:24.44 --> 00:54:29.44
I had saved all my money and bought one of these modern wetsuits at the time.

1467
00:54:29.44 --> 00:54:32.44
It was an O'Neill source was what it was called.

1468
00:54:32.44 --> 00:54:38.44
And it had an embedded hood or a hood that was part of the rest of it had a dry suit zipper.

1469
00:54:38.44 --> 00:54:43.44
Even though it was a wetsuit, it had a dry suit zipper just to keep as much water in there as you can.

1470
00:54:43.44 --> 00:54:47.44
And I showed up to seal team one with this wetsuit, which was like the most modern technology.

1471
00:54:47.44 --> 00:54:52.44
And we were doing swimmer lockouts, and I remember just that I was in heaven with this wetsuit.

1472
00:54:52.44 --> 00:54:58.44
Cause the wetsuits back in the early eighties, which you were wearing, just junk.

1473
00:54:58.44 --> 00:55:06.44
Yeah, well and even when we went through budgetishly, you didn't get a wetsuit during both..

1474
00:55:06.44 --> 00:55:10.44
You did eventually after a, a, a, a, a, as, a Jocque will tell you folks.

1475
00:55:10.44 --> 00:55:14.44
Though one of the big defining things there in seal training is the cold.

1476
00:55:14.44 --> 00:55:21.44
And you know, if you show up to something California to see palm trees, don't be deceived.

1477
00:55:21.44 --> 00:55:23.44
The water is cold.

1478
00:55:23.44 --> 00:55:24.44
Yeah.

1479
00:55:24.44 --> 00:55:28.44
You know, it probably several weeks in the training before they go.

1480
00:55:28.44 --> 00:55:30.44
And of course it was just picked something off the shelf.

1481
00:55:30.44 --> 00:55:31.44
Other fits or not.

1482
00:55:31.44 --> 00:55:36.44
Well, we got wet suits, but again, I knew from surfing and main.

1483
00:55:36.44 --> 00:55:40.44
And I was kind of on the forefront of wet suit technology.

1484
00:55:40.44 --> 00:55:45.44
And then I showed up at buds and they're issuing these wet suits, which they don't fit you.

1485
00:55:45.44 --> 00:55:48.44
It was an old school beaver tale with a zipper up the front.

1486
00:55:48.44 --> 00:55:50.44
I mean, they barely helped.

1487
00:55:50.44 --> 00:55:54.44
They barely. I mean, they provided some some bit of warmth, but barely.

1488
00:55:54.44 --> 00:55:56.44
What's the swimmer lock up?

1489
00:55:56.44 --> 00:55:58.44
So you're in a submarine.

1490
00:55:58.44 --> 00:56:01.44
And then underwater, you get out of the submarine and you go.

1491
00:56:01.44 --> 00:56:05.44
And it's a very common one was like on the U-boat, but for the American subs,

1492
00:56:05.44 --> 00:56:08.44
they have an escape chamber, which is a little ball.

1493
00:56:08.44 --> 00:56:11.44
It's a little, it's a little sphere that you're sitting in.

1494
00:56:11.44 --> 00:56:14.44
And it's probably six eight foot diameter.

1495
00:56:14.44 --> 00:56:15.44
Oh, that ball.

1496
00:56:15.44 --> 00:56:19.44
It's a baller on the ballistic missile submarine today's, but on the attack boats,

1497
00:56:19.44 --> 00:56:20.44
it's probably about four feet across.

1498
00:56:20.44 --> 00:56:22.44
It's tiny.

1499
00:56:22.44 --> 00:56:23.44
And you're in there.

1500
00:56:23.44 --> 00:56:26.44
And so you get in there from inside the sub.

1501
00:56:26.44 --> 00:56:29.44
And then that thing fills up with water.

1502
00:56:29.44 --> 00:56:33.44
And as it fills up with water, the pressure, the pressure equalizes with

1503
00:56:33.44 --> 00:56:38.44
what's outside, and you end up with just a little bit of air, a couple inches.

1504
00:56:38.44 --> 00:56:42.44
And then it equalizes, and then you can, the door opens up,

1505
00:56:42.44 --> 00:56:44.44
and you swim out of the submarine.

1506
00:56:44.44 --> 00:56:47.44
So I, I, I deployed on 12 submarines.

1507
00:56:47.44 --> 00:56:51.44
So back then, once you get, you know, no good deeds,

1508
00:56:51.44 --> 00:56:52.44
those are not punished.

1509
00:56:52.44 --> 00:56:53.44
You know that.

1510
00:56:53.44 --> 00:56:56.44
But so that's how I wound up doing the German U-boat.

1511
00:56:56.44 --> 00:56:59.44
And it was different now.

1512
00:56:59.44 --> 00:57:03.44
The U-boat's up in the Baltic, their electric.

1513
00:57:03.44 --> 00:57:05.44
So it's shallow up there as well.

1514
00:57:05.44 --> 00:57:09.44
Our submarines are deep deep draft, but they're silent.

1515
00:57:09.44 --> 00:57:11.44
Just like trying to listen to a battery.

1516
00:57:11.44 --> 00:57:17.44
And so it was a completely different experience.

1517
00:57:17.44 --> 00:57:22.44
And that German two-on-line have got eight-to-it-pito tubes up in the bow.

1518
00:57:22.44 --> 00:57:27.44
And what they did is, in port, they took torpedo out of the port side

1519
00:57:27.44 --> 00:57:29.44
and the starboard side.

1520
00:57:29.44 --> 00:57:30.44
So there's no torpedo.

1521
00:57:30.44 --> 00:57:34.44
Now keep in mind folks that this is only 21 inches wide.

1522
00:57:34.44 --> 00:57:39.44
And I guess about maybe 21 feet in length.

1523
00:57:39.44 --> 00:57:46.44
So we had to link up with the German U-boat in the middle of the Baltic.

1524
00:57:46.44 --> 00:57:49.44
So now this was, you know, planned exercise.

1525
00:57:49.44 --> 00:57:54.44
So we fly out of McRahanney, Scotland in a Air Force penetrating aircraft,

1526
00:57:54.44 --> 00:57:58.44
with low level over Europe and then over the Baltic by low level.

1527
00:57:58.44 --> 00:58:01.44
I'm talking about 100 feet or so.

1528
00:58:01.44 --> 00:58:03.44
And we get ready to go.

1529
00:58:03.44 --> 00:58:05.44
You've got your parachute on.

1530
00:58:05.44 --> 00:58:07.44
You've got your limits.

1531
00:58:07.44 --> 00:58:08.44
You've got your weapons.

1532
00:58:08.44 --> 00:58:10.44
And the door opens.

1533
00:58:10.44 --> 00:58:12.44
You're still at 100 feet.

1534
00:58:12.44 --> 00:58:13.44
And they tell you to get ready.

1535
00:58:13.44 --> 00:58:14.44
You stand up.

1536
00:58:14.44 --> 00:58:16.44
And then the aircraft comes up.

1537
00:58:16.44 --> 00:58:18.44
Just think like a bell curve.

1538
00:58:18.44 --> 00:58:21.44
It gets to about 900 feet or so.

1539
00:58:21.44 --> 00:58:23.44
And everybody just jumps out.

1540
00:58:23.44 --> 00:58:25.44
So the last man's out.

1541
00:58:25.44 --> 00:58:27.44
The aircraft dives back down.

1542
00:58:27.44 --> 00:58:28.44
All right.

1543
00:58:28.44 --> 00:58:31.44
So you wind up in the water.

1544
00:58:31.44 --> 00:58:32.44
Ditch the parachute.

1545
00:58:32.44 --> 00:58:33.44
You link up.

1546
00:58:33.44 --> 00:58:35.44
And we all get together.

1547
00:58:35.44 --> 00:58:41.44
And then I start taking one of my weights and banging it against the oxygen bottle.

1548
00:58:41.44 --> 00:58:46.44
So that the submarine can through, you know, so no pick us up.

1549
00:58:46.44 --> 00:58:50.44
So we're in the water for about an hour and a half to two hours.

1550
00:58:50.44 --> 00:58:54.44
And all of a sudden, as out of nowhere, the parachute scope.

1551
00:58:54.44 --> 00:58:55.44
Pairs go up.

1552
00:58:55.44 --> 00:58:57.44
It just scares the daylight setting.

1553
00:58:57.44 --> 00:58:59.44
So this is the best part about it.

1554
00:58:59.44 --> 00:59:00.44
Right.

1555
00:59:00.44 --> 00:59:02.44
So now we're in the middle of the Baltic.

1556
00:59:02.44 --> 00:59:04.44
The submarine is there.

1557
00:59:04.44 --> 00:59:09.44
I've got to go to the side of the submarine and tap on it to certain signal to let them know that it's us.

1558
00:59:09.44 --> 00:59:11.44
Who else is it going to be?

1559
00:59:11.44 --> 00:59:14.44
Who else is out there beside us?

1560
00:59:14.44 --> 00:59:16.44
Right.

1561
00:59:16.44 --> 00:59:19.44
So so that when they do that,

1562
00:59:19.44 --> 00:59:22.44
they, they, the torpedo tubes have already been flooded.

1563
00:59:22.44 --> 00:59:25.44
They open the shutters and this is,

1564
00:59:25.44 --> 00:59:27.44
uh, not without great risk.

1565
00:59:27.44 --> 00:59:31.44
So the first swimmer went in, uh, to feed first.

1566
00:59:31.44 --> 00:59:33.44
And that was the my swim partner.

1567
00:59:33.44 --> 00:59:34.44
But I would go away.

1568
00:59:34.44 --> 00:59:36.44
And that was Chuck Williams.

1569
00:59:36.44 --> 00:59:37.44
Chuck Williams.

1570
00:59:37.44 --> 00:59:39.44
Who's that beast in the water for sure?

1571
00:59:39.44 --> 00:59:40.44
He's that team to do it.

1572
00:59:40.44 --> 00:59:41.44
I was a team to do it.

1573
00:59:41.44 --> 00:59:42.44
It was a stud.

1574
00:59:42.44 --> 00:59:44.44
I told him everything he does.

1575
00:59:44.44 --> 00:59:47.44
And then I would go in next to Chuck.

1576
00:59:47.44 --> 00:59:49.44
And we're right next to each other.

1577
00:59:49.44 --> 00:59:51.44
That I mean, we can kiss each other.

1578
00:59:51.44 --> 00:59:54.44
Now keep in mind, we've probably had 300 hours together under water.

1579
00:59:54.44 --> 00:59:55.44
So far.

1580
00:59:55.44 --> 00:59:59.44
Now then the second swim pair comes in, feed first.

1581
00:59:59.44 --> 01:00:03.44
And that, he puts his fins on top of my thighs.

1582
01:00:03.44 --> 01:00:05.44
Uh, and then the last guy comes in.

1583
01:00:05.44 --> 01:00:09.44
And once he comes in, once he's clear of the shutters,

1584
01:00:09.44 --> 01:00:11.44
you know, he squeezes his body,

1585
01:00:11.44 --> 01:00:13.44
who taps me on my thighs.

1586
01:00:13.44 --> 01:00:16.44
I've got the weight and that I tap the submarine.

1587
01:00:16.44 --> 01:00:19.44
The submarine, so that they could close the shutters.

1588
01:00:19.44 --> 01:00:21.44
So, all right, we're in.

1589
01:00:21.44 --> 01:00:28.44
Now the torpedo tube is designed to let absolutely no light escape.

1590
01:00:28.44 --> 01:00:31.44
So even if you had a flashlight,

1591
01:00:31.44 --> 01:00:33.44
you can't see anything inside.

1592
01:00:33.44 --> 01:00:35.44
I know keep in mind it's 21 inches.

1593
01:00:35.44 --> 01:00:36.44
We're next to each other.

1594
01:00:36.44 --> 01:00:39.44
And you have to take your drag or off to get in there.

1595
01:00:39.44 --> 01:00:39.44
No.

1596
01:00:39.44 --> 01:00:40.44
Okay.

1597
01:00:40.44 --> 01:00:41.44
So I'll be in.

1598
01:00:41.44 --> 01:00:44.44
So no, because the thing is, oh, now it comes to the life or death situation.

1599
01:00:44.44 --> 01:00:52.44
So, so the reason why we figured we could do this is because an oxygen bubble is smaller than the nitrogen bubble because of what's going to happen next.

1600
01:00:52.44 --> 01:00:58.44
So, um, we've got a lock into the submarine and come into the torpedo room.

1601
01:00:58.44 --> 01:01:02.44
Now the torpedo room and the submarine is pressurized to sea level.

1602
01:01:02.44 --> 01:01:04.44
But we're at 14 meters.

1603
01:01:04.44 --> 01:01:09.44
So, um, it was, so you depressurize, then you do water.

1604
01:01:09.44 --> 01:01:12.44
So I got a tap signal, we're all in.

1605
01:01:12.44 --> 01:01:16.44
And then they said, you know, whenever it was, get ready to go.

1606
01:01:16.44 --> 01:01:24.44
So get ready to go means we all had to breathe or air bags or, you know, down to is thin as a paper.

1607
01:01:24.44 --> 01:01:28.44
Now our folks out there are bags or about the size of a football.

1608
01:01:28.44 --> 01:01:29.44
Mm-hmm.

1609
01:01:29.44 --> 01:01:30.44
That's it.

1610
01:01:30.44 --> 01:01:33.44
But it had to be, you know, really sincerely paper.

1611
01:01:33.44 --> 01:01:36.44
And once you had it down, then my partner would squeeze me.

1612
01:01:36.44 --> 01:01:38.44
And then the guys would kick me, right?

1613
01:01:38.44 --> 01:01:42.44
And then it was a, and I, and I would squeeze it, you ready to go, you ready to go.

1614
01:01:42.44 --> 01:01:45.44
And then I would tap them, we're ready to go, right?

1615
01:01:45.44 --> 01:01:47.44
And it goes, here we go.

1616
01:01:47.44 --> 01:01:52.44
And then they would pressurize the torpedo tube that would,

1617
01:01:52.44 --> 01:01:55.44
or take us from 14 meters to the surface in one second.

1618
01:01:55.44 --> 01:02:00.44
So with the gas expansion, you know, that, so it was equivalent to,

1619
01:02:00.44 --> 01:02:03.44
I mean this is surely a, get good you know.

1620
01:02:03.44 --> 01:02:08.44
It was equivalent to, you know, having a small quarter pound half pound block of TNT

1621
01:02:08.44 --> 01:02:13.44
or in the, in the torpedo tube, it picked the form, I saw it.

1622
01:02:13.44 --> 01:02:17.44
And just the pressurization just rattles you it's a,

1623
01:02:17.44 --> 01:02:19.44
all right?

1624
01:02:19.44 --> 01:02:22.44
And you can see it, the guys,

1625
01:02:22.44 --> 01:02:25.44
so, but it was done, you're okay, you're okay.

1626
01:02:25.44 --> 01:02:28.44
So then they have to do water and you come out.

1627
01:02:28.44 --> 01:02:33.44
So, you know, Chuck Williams comes out and then I come out,

1628
01:02:33.44 --> 01:02:35.44
think I come out and you know, look at me like,

1629
01:02:35.44 --> 01:02:39.44
Mr. McWire, you gotta do something about this, you know?

1630
01:02:39.44 --> 01:02:43.44
And that's just your, that's it, we're just just getting into the boat.

1631
01:02:43.44 --> 01:02:45.44
You have done anything, you have done anything, yeah.

1632
01:02:45.44 --> 01:02:46.44
Oh no, this is showing up.

1633
01:02:46.44 --> 01:02:51.44
Oh no, so now we've got a, now we've got a three day transit to the targets on board this,

1634
01:02:51.44 --> 01:02:56.44
you know, German U-boat, which is, if you've seen dust boot,

1635
01:02:56.44 --> 01:02:58.44
I mean, all about it.

1636
01:02:58.44 --> 01:03:01.44
Everybody in the submarine is at a central casting.

1637
01:03:01.44 --> 01:03:04.44
I mean, the captain is 35 years of age.

1638
01:03:04.44 --> 01:03:06.44
He's got the white turtle neck, he's got the beard, he's got the Hayes,

1639
01:03:06.44 --> 01:03:11.44
got the jack boots, and the sausages hanging back and forth.

1640
01:03:11.44 --> 01:03:15.44
Now, it's a small crew, it's probably only about maybe 30.

1641
01:03:15.44 --> 01:03:18.44
And around the clock, these guys are working,

1642
01:03:18.44 --> 01:03:24.44
but we were supposed to be trying to sleep right by the torpedo room,

1643
01:03:24.44 --> 01:03:25.44
which is also the Messe deck.

1644
01:03:25.44 --> 01:03:28.44
So we'd get about two hours sleep, and wake us up,

1645
01:03:28.44 --> 01:03:31.44
because they'd have to set up for a meal, and you know, go back to sleep.

1646
01:03:31.44 --> 01:03:34.44
So we didn't actually sleep for a couple of days,

1647
01:03:34.44 --> 01:03:36.44
but then as we start getting into the target,

1648
01:03:36.44 --> 01:03:41.44
they take mattresses and blankets and put them all on the deck.

1649
01:03:41.44 --> 01:03:44.44
Now, and, you know, we have our wet suits and everything,

1650
01:03:44.44 --> 01:03:47.44
which was a mistake in the torpedo.

1651
01:03:47.44 --> 01:03:51.44
You know, you're putting on a wet, wet suits that, you know,

1652
01:03:51.44 --> 01:03:52.44
in 30 degrees.

1653
01:03:52.44 --> 01:03:55.44
But we can hear the A.S.W. craft overhead.

1654
01:03:55.44 --> 01:03:57.44
So as the summeries coming in, you're the ping, ping, ping,

1655
01:03:57.44 --> 01:04:00.44
and then the summery we just sit in the bottom, and you're new.

1656
01:04:00.44 --> 01:04:04.44
The propeller, the one by, once the propeller went by,

1657
01:04:04.44 --> 01:04:08.44
the summery we'd come up, and take us at a little bit further.

1658
01:04:08.44 --> 01:04:12.44
Now, the Germans are helping us get dressed, putting on stuff on,

1659
01:04:12.44 --> 01:04:15.44
and they're going to be a little bit more comfortable.

1660
01:04:15.44 --> 01:04:17.44
So, we're going to get some rest of the summer,

1661
01:04:17.44 --> 01:04:19.44
and we're going to get some rest of the summer,

1662
01:04:19.44 --> 01:04:22.44
and the Germans are helping us get dressed, putting on stuff on,

1663
01:04:22.44 --> 01:04:24.44
and because the mattresses were going to floor,

1664
01:04:24.44 --> 01:04:26.44
and the blankets were going to floor, so,

1665
01:04:26.44 --> 01:04:29.44
these sonar from the surface ships, they're not picking any of that out.

1666
01:04:29.44 --> 01:04:34.44
And then, one by one, they pick us up slowly, you know,

1667
01:04:34.44 --> 01:04:39.44
load us in to, so, I'm the last guy to go in.

1668
01:04:39.44 --> 01:04:43.44
And I mean, it's just, so as I'm going to the captain comes,

1669
01:04:43.44 --> 01:04:45.44
and you know, to wish me well,

1670
01:04:45.44 --> 01:04:48.44
and he can say a couple of things, you know, you know,

1671
01:04:48.44 --> 01:04:53.44
target bears, one, three, zero, and so good luck,

1672
01:04:53.44 --> 01:04:55.44
and good hunting.

1673
01:04:55.44 --> 01:04:58.44
Then he gives me a plaque.

1674
01:04:58.44 --> 01:05:01.44
He got a stick in my wits, right?

1675
01:05:01.44 --> 01:05:05.44
So, we go through the reverse, and then we're, you know,

1676
01:05:05.44 --> 01:05:09.44
14 meters, and then we have to go, I get pressurized,

1677
01:05:09.44 --> 01:05:12.44
or no, we're at surface, then we have to get pressurized.

1678
01:05:12.44 --> 01:05:15.44
So, that wasn't as bad because you're getting pressurized,

1679
01:05:15.44 --> 01:05:18.44
it's supposed to depressurize, you didn't have the gas expansion on that,

1680
01:05:18.44 --> 01:05:21.44
but you had to worry about squeezes and some of the other things.

1681
01:05:21.44 --> 01:05:23.44
And then you come to the surface, and, you know,

1682
01:05:23.44 --> 01:05:26.44
we're probably about, oh, maybe five miles out,

1683
01:05:26.44 --> 01:05:29.44
and we weren't supposed to be five miles out.

1684
01:05:29.44 --> 01:05:31.44
What happened was that, you know,

1685
01:05:31.44 --> 01:05:36.44
he couldn't speak to me on that, that he viewed the threat from the A.S.W. boats

1686
01:05:36.44 --> 01:05:39.44
and the picket boats, two great to bring the submarine in,

1687
01:05:39.44 --> 01:05:42.44
and get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get in compromise.

1688
01:05:42.44 --> 01:05:46.44
And we're out there, and, you know, now, you're five miles off the coast,

1689
01:05:46.44 --> 01:05:49.44
and you're in the water, and you're looking,

1690
01:05:49.44 --> 01:05:51.44
and, you know, you've got your little bends compass

1691
01:05:51.44 --> 01:05:54.44
and you try to figure out, and, you know, where is it?

1692
01:05:54.44 --> 01:05:56.44
Where is it? Where is it? Where is it? Where is the target?

1693
01:05:56.44 --> 01:06:00.44
And I said the truck, that's got to be at buddy.

1694
01:06:00.44 --> 01:06:02.44
See that one area that's totally black?

1695
01:06:02.44 --> 01:06:05.44
That's a giveaway, that's got to be the target.

1696
01:06:05.44 --> 01:06:10.44
So, we started going towards that, and certain of the warpicket boats there.

1697
01:06:10.44 --> 01:06:14.44
So, we had a plan dive that was supposed to start pretty much at the mouth of the harbor,

1698
01:06:14.44 --> 01:06:16.44
and we had to start way before that.

1699
01:06:16.44 --> 01:06:22.44
So, we actually spent a little over three hours submerged in this,

1700
01:06:22.44 --> 01:06:24.44
that harbor and the open it's.

1701
01:06:24.44 --> 01:06:30.44
And as we're coming out, Chuck, no, we didn't need to talk anymore.

1702
01:06:30.44 --> 01:06:34.44
I mean, we could squeeze and, and, and, you know, we, we,

1703
01:06:34.44 --> 01:06:38.44
we did what we needed to do. We put the, the, the packages on the ships,

1704
01:06:38.44 --> 01:06:44.44
and he signals to me on Friday, which was, you know, gas Olympia.

1705
01:06:44.44 --> 01:06:48.44
And, uh, I said, so, okay, let's go over to the side.

1706
01:06:48.44 --> 01:06:54.44
So, now we go to the side of the harbor, and he takes his mask off.

1707
01:06:54.44 --> 01:06:58.44
He goes, I'm screwed. He said, I've got this pounding headache.

1708
01:06:58.44 --> 01:07:01.44
I've got narrow vision. I can't, I can't see much of anything.

1709
01:07:01.44 --> 01:07:03.44
What we did, we screwed up.

1710
01:07:03.44 --> 01:07:07.44
Um, we brought additional oxygen bottles on what the submarine,

1711
01:07:07.44 --> 01:07:11.44
but we didn't bring in additional sodas or this grubber.

1712
01:07:11.44 --> 01:07:15.44
So, what Chuck had done, working so hard for that much time in the water,

1713
01:07:15.44 --> 01:07:20.44
is that, um, he overbreeth his rig. I mean, we're working hard.

1714
01:07:20.44 --> 01:07:26.44
Uh, and then the, uh, the, the scrubber that takes the nitrogen out of,

1715
01:07:26.44 --> 01:07:29.44
you know, your rebreathing, although he had more oxygen in the bottle,

1716
01:07:29.44 --> 01:07:33.44
was no longer working. So, he was having a tremendous nitrogen buildup,

1717
01:07:33.44 --> 01:07:36.44
and he said, I just can't go out of the further.

1718
01:07:36.44 --> 01:07:41.44
Uh, now we've only got about a, maybe a little quarter mile more to get out of the harbor,

1719
01:07:41.44 --> 01:07:45.44
but we're not going to, and now this, this pickets on one of the sea walls,

1720
01:07:45.44 --> 01:07:49.44
waiting for us. So, we just kind of sit there and you figure,

1721
01:07:49.44 --> 01:07:54.44
all right, so this is a Northern Europe harbor, and the sea wall is probably,

1722
01:07:54.44 --> 01:07:59.44
uh, 12 feet high, maybe six to seven feet wide,

1723
01:07:59.44 --> 01:08:05.44
and um, if you're going to, the only way we're going to do this is we've got to get over the sea wall,

1724
01:08:05.44 --> 01:08:09.44
get to the ocean side, and see what we take it from there.

1725
01:08:09.44 --> 01:08:15.44
So, uh, Chuck's a tall guy, and I was able to get on Chuck shoulders,

1726
01:08:15.44 --> 01:08:20.44
and jump up to the top, and then, you know, he handed me, you know,

1727
01:08:20.44 --> 01:08:25.44
my droger, his droger, and then I was able to, you know, pull him up,

1728
01:08:25.44 --> 01:08:29.44
and that the tool was just, you know, lying there, that we rolled over to the other side,

1729
01:08:29.44 --> 01:08:33.44
and it just kind of dropped down, uh, with, with all of our toys,

1730
01:08:33.44 --> 01:08:37.44
and just laid there for about 10 minutes to see, and, you know,

1731
01:08:37.44 --> 01:08:40.44
nope, I mean, they had flares going off, and other things there.

1732
01:08:40.44 --> 01:08:47.44
And now, the rendezvous, we had a fishing boat that was from a Danish intelligence,

1733
01:08:47.44 --> 01:08:51.44
that was supposed to be at a certain place, and, um,

1734
01:08:51.44 --> 01:08:56.44
you're looking there, and they're not at that certain place,

1735
01:08:56.44 --> 01:09:01.44
but there is one boat out there that is another couple of miles away.

1736
01:09:01.44 --> 01:09:07.44
Right? So, um, I go, now, if we did make the rendezvous,

1737
01:09:07.44 --> 01:09:11.44
then you had to go into the E&E nets, and if these are folks,

1738
01:09:11.44 --> 01:09:15.44
they fought World War II, so this was, you did that, I mean, you know,

1739
01:09:15.44 --> 01:09:18.44
I don't want to go into the E&E.

1740
01:09:18.44 --> 01:09:22.44
So I said, Chuck, it's not where it's supposed to be, but that's about right.

1741
01:09:22.44 --> 01:09:26.44
Well, it's about, I said, but I said, that's gotta be it.

1742
01:09:26.44 --> 01:09:29.44
So let's go. So we take off surface warming,

1743
01:09:29.44 --> 01:09:33.44
you know, on our back, and now he's kicking out the Olympic quality,

1744
01:09:33.44 --> 01:09:40.44
and now my hip from my broken pelvis is kind of unspent.

1745
01:09:40.44 --> 01:09:43.44
So while I'm trying to do, because my swim is getting to trim,

1746
01:09:43.44 --> 01:09:45.44
and I'll hold him up that much.

1747
01:09:45.44 --> 01:09:48.44
So we get to this boat, and before we get to the boat,

1748
01:09:48.44 --> 01:09:54.44
we have to go back on back, and then we have to go underneath the fishing boat,

1749
01:09:54.44 --> 01:09:58.44
and underneath the fishing boat, there were cab lights.

1750
01:09:58.44 --> 01:10:01.44
Then displayed, that told us this is the right boat.

1751
01:10:01.44 --> 01:10:03.44
Now here it gets fun again, right?

1752
01:10:03.44 --> 01:10:07.44
So we go up to the fishing boat, and there's a ladder over the side,

1753
01:10:07.44 --> 01:10:11.44
and the guys in the fishing boat, Danish.

1754
01:10:11.44 --> 01:10:14.44
You know, we had to give them a certain bonus feedy.

1755
01:10:14.44 --> 01:10:18.44
You know, no, I've got a gun, you know, it's supposed to be a compromise, right?

1756
01:10:18.44 --> 01:10:19.44
I figured, there's two things.

1757
01:10:19.44 --> 01:10:23.44
One, I'm getting, no, I don't care if it's Russians, I'm getting on that boat,

1758
01:10:23.44 --> 01:10:26.44
and two, if they won't let us on, I'm shooting myself.

1759
01:10:26.44 --> 01:10:29.44
So you're freezing, you're dehydrated, you've been in the water for 13 hours.

1760
01:10:29.44 --> 01:10:32.44
They take it below deck, and it's a real fishing boat.

1761
01:10:32.44 --> 01:10:37.44
So they add an artificial side of the boat that they take off,

1762
01:10:37.44 --> 01:10:41.44
and put against the skin of the ship, and they put the tubeless linen

1763
01:10:41.44 --> 01:10:46.44
against the skin of the ship, and give us a couple of these big beers and chocolate bars,

1764
01:10:46.44 --> 01:10:51.44
and then put the back on there, and then put fish on top of that.

1765
01:10:51.44 --> 01:10:55.44
No, I want to put the fish on top of that.

1766
01:10:55.44 --> 01:10:58.44
No, I want to black us, and I want to go on a water.

1767
01:10:58.44 --> 01:11:02.44
Said the tubeless just had to hug each other all the way, it did that like.

1768
01:11:02.44 --> 01:11:06.44
What, you know, it's one of those things that, you know,

1769
01:11:06.44 --> 01:11:08.44
the recruiters doesn't tell you that stuff.

1770
01:11:08.44 --> 01:11:11.44
Sounds like a Navy achievement, that'll at least make me,

1771
01:11:11.44 --> 01:11:13.44
no, no, they didn't give up, and that'll be back there, you know?

1772
01:11:13.44 --> 01:11:16.44
No, no, I got the breast fig leaf for broncholeaf palms,

1773
01:11:16.44 --> 01:11:18.44
I think that's what it was.

1774
01:11:18.44 --> 01:11:20.44
Oh, that's brutal.

1775
01:11:20.44 --> 01:11:23.44
It was brutal, but you know, you know, this chocolate is so surely,

1776
01:11:23.44 --> 01:11:27.44
it was, but just to be able to come back in and just go,

1777
01:11:27.44 --> 01:11:28.44
mission accomplished.

1778
01:11:28.44 --> 01:11:29.44
Yeah.

1779
01:11:29.44 --> 01:11:30.44
We did it, man.

1780
01:11:30.44 --> 01:11:32.44
And it was, we did it the hard way, but we did it just,

1781
01:11:32.44 --> 01:11:35.44
the tremendous satisfaction you get from being a seal,

1782
01:11:35.44 --> 01:11:39.44
and being able to do a really hard mission,

1783
01:11:39.44 --> 01:11:42.44
and, you know, even in my fitness report, you know,

1784
01:11:42.44 --> 01:11:44.44
when that, you know, Rick, when I'd brought it there,

1785
01:11:44.44 --> 01:11:47.44
they're very few people, if any, in the world,

1786
01:11:47.44 --> 01:11:50.44
that could do with what these guys did, the sex-assize.

1787
01:11:50.44 --> 01:11:52.44
So, that's, that's a freaking rough one.

1788
01:11:52.44 --> 01:11:53.44
Oh, yeah.

1789
01:11:53.44 --> 01:11:55.44
I did a, was on an art cartoon.

1790
01:11:55.44 --> 01:11:57.44
I did a recon.

1791
01:11:57.44 --> 01:11:58.44
We dove into a harbor.

1792
01:11:58.44 --> 01:12:00.44
We took pictures.

1793
01:12:00.44 --> 01:12:03.44
And the of whatever ship was up here at Camp Pendleton.

1794
01:12:03.44 --> 01:12:04.44
You know, we dove in.

1795
01:12:04.44 --> 01:12:05.44
We got out of the water.

1796
01:12:05.44 --> 01:12:08.44
We took pictures, and this was the old school, you know, film.

1797
01:12:08.44 --> 01:12:11.44
And we come back out, and I, I had gotten, I had gotten,

1798
01:12:11.44 --> 01:12:13.44
like, purchased in the perfect spot.

1799
01:12:13.44 --> 01:12:15.44
I was able to keep this shutter open for like minutes,

1800
01:12:15.44 --> 01:12:17.44
and just hold it perfectly.

1801
01:12:17.44 --> 01:12:18.44
And so I took a bunch of pictures.

1802
01:12:18.44 --> 01:12:20.44
We came back, and then, and then the report,

1803
01:12:20.44 --> 01:12:23.44
I got back from, from my Patoon Commander was that, you know,

1804
01:12:23.44 --> 01:12:25.44
the, the, the, and Fabius ready group commander said,

1805
01:12:25.44 --> 01:12:28.44
I thought these guys went in there during the night,

1806
01:12:28.44 --> 01:12:29.44
and the, and the Patoon Commander said,

1807
01:12:29.44 --> 01:12:31.44
they did go in there night.

1808
01:12:31.44 --> 01:12:33.44
This is, this is good photography.

1809
01:12:33.44 --> 01:12:34.44
But yeah, same kind of feeling.

1810
01:12:34.44 --> 01:12:37.44
And I just tell guys, when you're doing a water off,

1811
01:12:37.44 --> 01:12:39.44
it's a real world, Bob.

1812
01:12:39.44 --> 01:12:41.44
But there's, there's all kinds of things that can kill you.

1813
01:12:41.44 --> 01:12:44.44
Hopefully when you're out there, especially in 30-degree water,

1814
01:12:44.44 --> 01:12:46.44
and 40-degree water, and on, you know,

1815
01:12:46.44 --> 01:12:48.44
doing the, in and out of the submarine.

1816
01:12:48.44 --> 01:12:50.44
Yeah.

1817
01:12:50.44 --> 01:12:51.44
Oh, joke.

1818
01:12:51.44 --> 01:12:53.44
Yeah, I'm in the,

1819
01:12:53.44 --> 01:12:54.44
class, I had to be in Buds.

1820
01:12:54.44 --> 01:12:55.44
We lost a young,

1821
01:12:55.44 --> 01:12:59.44
trainee doing surf passage with,

1822
01:12:59.44 --> 01:13:03.44
those big, heavy rakes that we had through the plunging

1823
01:13:03.44 --> 01:13:05.44
Coronado surf.

1824
01:13:05.44 --> 01:13:07.44
He hit his head on the back of his,

1825
01:13:07.44 --> 01:13:09.44
regulator, and knocked him out,

1826
01:13:09.44 --> 01:13:11.44
but then picked up the swim pair,

1827
01:13:11.44 --> 01:13:13.44
and the tour of the body line.

1828
01:13:13.44 --> 01:13:16.44
And they lost him, and finally got him some time later.

1829
01:13:16.44 --> 01:13:19.44
Yeah, I mean, it's, it's, it's for real.

1830
01:13:19.44 --> 01:13:21.44
And the ocean can kill you or the weather.

1831
01:13:21.44 --> 01:13:24.44
You know, it used to be the patrol lead as car that we had years ago.

1832
01:13:24.44 --> 01:13:26.44
The first thing you'd start off was listing enemy,

1833
01:13:26.44 --> 01:13:28.44
and the first thing you'd list it was weather.

1834
01:13:28.44 --> 01:13:34.44
So, what did you do after that deployment?

1835
01:13:34.44 --> 01:13:37.44
Well, that's when I went to graduate school.

1836
01:13:37.44 --> 01:13:38.44
Okay.

1837
01:13:38.44 --> 01:13:41.44
So I, I went to, they've opposed graduate school,

1838
01:13:41.44 --> 01:13:45.44
and studied scientific and technical intelligence.

1839
01:13:45.44 --> 01:13:49.44
And I thought, alright, I got 18 months of surfing,

1840
01:13:49.44 --> 01:13:52.44
and screw it off.

1841
01:13:52.44 --> 01:13:55.44
And so my brother went to the University of Michigan,

1842
01:13:55.44 --> 01:13:56.44
got his MBA.

1843
01:13:56.44 --> 01:14:00.44
For 24 months, he took 40 credits.

1844
01:14:00.44 --> 01:14:02.44
I went to the Naval Postgraduate School,

1845
01:14:02.44 --> 01:14:05.44
and in 18 months to 96 credits,

1846
01:14:05.44 --> 01:14:09.44
of which I had three electives, three credit electives.

1847
01:14:09.44 --> 01:14:10.44
That's it.

1848
01:14:10.44 --> 01:14:13.44
And a good portion of it was in the physical lab.

1849
01:14:13.44 --> 01:14:17.44
And, you know, we're designing the shape of scientific intelligence.

1850
01:14:17.44 --> 01:14:18.44
I kind of missed that.

1851
01:14:18.44 --> 01:14:24.44
So, but it was a great education.

1852
01:14:24.44 --> 01:14:28.44
And, you know, I really, one, I enjoyed living in Central California,

1853
01:14:28.44 --> 01:14:31.44
do I mean, we want to do in triathlons and some other good stuff.

1854
01:14:31.44 --> 01:14:34.44
But being able to complete that curriculum then,

1855
01:14:34.44 --> 01:14:38.44
and then leaving there and getting all of the intelligence accesses,

1856
01:14:38.44 --> 01:14:40.44
that you don't realize that those things exist

1857
01:14:40.44 --> 01:14:42.44
and so you get into the secret clubhouse.

1858
01:14:42.44 --> 01:14:44.44
And then I was in the secret clubhouse,

1859
01:14:44.44 --> 01:14:47.44
and I left there and went to Naval Special Warfare Group 2

1860
01:14:47.44 --> 01:14:52.44
in Virginia Beach, which is the oversight group command

1861
01:14:52.44 --> 01:14:54.44
for the SEAL teams on the East Coast

1862
01:14:54.44 --> 01:14:56.44
as the intelligence officer there.

1863
01:14:56.44 --> 01:15:00.44
So it was a very, very good time to be the intel officer

1864
01:15:00.44 --> 01:15:04.44
because we were involved in 1986, Elder Ronald Canyon,

1865
01:15:04.44 --> 01:15:06.44
the Libyan campaign.

1866
01:15:06.44 --> 01:15:09.44
We had the Central American Wars,

1867
01:15:09.44 --> 01:15:14.44
and also we did a significant amount of work

1868
01:15:14.44 --> 01:15:16.44
and other areas there.

1869
01:15:16.44 --> 01:15:19.44
But, you know, that really is what I first got involved

1870
01:15:19.44 --> 01:15:22.44
and deeply involved in intelligence.

1871
01:15:22.44 --> 01:15:26.44
But to me, it just went hand in glove with being a SEAL

1872
01:15:26.44 --> 01:15:28.44
that you know what to ask for,

1873
01:15:28.44 --> 01:15:30.44
that we didn't really know what the menu was,

1874
01:15:30.44 --> 01:15:32.44
because you didn't know.

1875
01:15:32.44 --> 01:15:34.44
We just kept ordering burgers and fries.

1876
01:15:34.44 --> 01:15:38.44
But once you realize exactly what the intelligence community

1877
01:15:38.44 --> 01:15:41.44
got in this capability, you can really refine.

1878
01:15:41.44 --> 01:15:43.44
And the other thing is, well, more importantly,

1879
01:15:43.44 --> 01:15:44.44
as you know this, Jaco,

1880
01:15:44.44 --> 01:15:46.44
it doesn't matter what you got in your collar,

1881
01:15:46.44 --> 01:15:49.44
it doesn't matter who you know in relationships.

1882
01:15:49.44 --> 01:15:51.44
It's all about relationships.

1883
01:15:51.44 --> 01:15:53.44
And when you had folks who were there,

1884
01:15:53.44 --> 01:15:54.44
the end two of second fleet,

1885
01:15:54.44 --> 01:15:57.44
and I went to graduate school with this individual.

1886
01:15:57.44 --> 01:15:59.44
You know, that really paid off great dividends,

1887
01:15:59.44 --> 01:16:01.44
you know, for their community.

1888
01:16:01.44 --> 01:16:04.44
But, you know, when it came to what we were doing

1889
01:16:04.44 --> 01:16:07.44
and you know, been gasi and all these other places,

1890
01:16:07.44 --> 01:16:11.44
you know, I mean, we had built target folders for full and that stuff.

1891
01:16:11.44 --> 01:16:13.44
And when it comes to final jeopardy,

1892
01:16:13.44 --> 01:16:15.44
if it's a geograph or question,

1893
01:16:15.44 --> 01:16:17.44
I probably had a target folder on it.

1894
01:16:17.44 --> 01:16:21.44
And then, didn't you end up going to now back to SDV?

1895
01:16:21.44 --> 01:16:23.44
And when did SDV form up?

1896
01:16:23.44 --> 01:16:25.44
SDV team too?

1897
01:16:25.44 --> 01:16:32.44
SDV team too formed up in about 1979, 1979 or 80.

1898
01:16:32.44 --> 01:16:34.44
Because we had a UDT,

1899
01:16:34.44 --> 01:16:38.44
we had an SDV detachment in UDT-21.

1900
01:16:38.44 --> 01:16:42.44
And that was siphoning off so much of our money

1901
01:16:42.44 --> 01:16:46.44
and so much of our time because a great idea.

1902
01:16:46.44 --> 01:16:48.44
But we did not have the technology.

1903
01:16:48.44 --> 01:16:50.44
And the guy spent the great deal of their time

1904
01:16:50.44 --> 01:16:52.44
switching out the bow holes because they kept crashing

1905
01:16:52.44 --> 01:16:55.44
and it'd appear as a rocks and some other things.

1906
01:16:55.44 --> 01:16:56.44
But called him miserable.

1907
01:16:56.44 --> 01:16:58.44
But the other thing as well,

1908
01:16:58.44 --> 01:17:00.44
it was a really good time for me to go to SDV.

1909
01:17:00.44 --> 01:17:02.44
Because that when we first started to modify

1910
01:17:02.44 --> 01:17:05.44
the nuclear power and submarine's to carry us,

1911
01:17:05.44 --> 01:17:06.44
I suppose to just have it as go on there and

1912
01:17:06.44 --> 01:17:09.44
putting towels on the deck and tell us not to make a mess.

1913
01:17:09.44 --> 01:17:11.44
And we just had the dry deck shelter.

1914
01:17:11.44 --> 01:17:14.44
We had the mobility improvement project,

1915
01:17:14.44 --> 01:17:20.44
which was a national mission to the first dry deck shelter,

1916
01:17:20.44 --> 01:17:22.44
which is, this is a garage folks that we put

1917
01:17:22.44 --> 01:17:24.44
on the nuclear submarine.

1918
01:17:24.44 --> 01:17:28.44
And we put our submersible boats in there.

1919
01:17:28.44 --> 01:17:32.44
And we come out of the submarine and into that

1920
01:17:32.44 --> 01:17:33.44
it's like a garage.

1921
01:17:33.44 --> 01:17:35.44
And then we go off on a mission,

1922
01:17:35.44 --> 01:17:41.44
probably about 10 to 12 hours and cold, wet, submarine.

1923
01:17:41.44 --> 01:17:46.44
And it really, I'm glad that I had that other background

1924
01:17:46.44 --> 01:17:51.44
in that that I was able to bring an awful lot to comfort.

1925
01:17:51.44 --> 01:17:53.44
The commanding officers of the submarine,

1926
01:17:53.44 --> 01:17:55.44
that you guys are going to run my career,

1927
01:17:55.44 --> 01:17:57.44
it's going to be okay, Captain.

1928
01:17:57.44 --> 01:18:00.44
We probably will, but it's going to be okay.

1929
01:18:00.44 --> 01:18:04.44
But yeah, and Bill McCraver was there just before me,

1930
01:18:04.44 --> 01:18:07.44
as a Flushoon Commander, an Evan Thompson.

1931
01:18:07.44 --> 01:18:11.44
But also at that point, I didn't want to be that ambitious,

1932
01:18:11.44 --> 01:18:13.44
Jaco, I mean, that's just early.

1933
01:18:13.44 --> 01:18:17.44
But I just figured, if I ever do wind up being a charge

1934
01:18:17.44 --> 01:18:20.44
of the community, I'd like to know something about everything

1935
01:18:20.44 --> 01:18:21.44
in the community.

1936
01:18:21.44 --> 01:18:26.44
And I really strive to at least have one tour

1937
01:18:26.44 --> 01:18:29.44
and have a good sense of what it's all about.

1938
01:18:29.44 --> 01:18:31.44
At what point did you realize you were just going to do

1939
01:18:31.44 --> 01:18:33.44
as long as you could do?

1940
01:18:33.44 --> 01:18:36.44
Oh, when my wife told me that.

1941
01:18:36.44 --> 01:18:39.44
So I mean, this is really.

1942
01:18:39.44 --> 01:18:43.44
So I guess I was at the 10 year point.

1943
01:18:43.44 --> 01:18:47.44
We just, we, you know, we did Grenada,

1944
01:18:47.44 --> 01:18:51.44
Vietnam is over, and we're going to do anything ever again.

1945
01:18:51.44 --> 01:18:53.44
And it was kind of unlikely.

1946
01:18:53.44 --> 01:18:56.44
I mean, we do it exercises and everybody was bored.

1947
01:18:56.44 --> 01:18:59.44
And I was not, well, I don't know if my old,

1948
01:18:59.44 --> 01:19:01.44
for me to see your guys listen to that.

1949
01:19:01.44 --> 01:19:05.44
And we're not a whole lot of folks who were inspirational leaders.

1950
01:19:05.44 --> 01:19:07.44
Adam, let me put it to you that way.

1951
01:19:07.44 --> 01:19:10.44
And I just figured, okay, I'm going to go to law school.

1952
01:19:10.44 --> 01:19:15.44
So I was applying to law school, and I'm, I'm dead serious.

1953
01:19:15.44 --> 01:19:17.44
I'm going to go, be a lawyer.

1954
01:19:17.44 --> 01:19:20.44
And I finally get this counseling session from Kathy.

1955
01:19:20.44 --> 01:19:22.44
She goes, you're not going to be a lawyer.

1956
01:19:22.44 --> 01:19:25.44
She said, you are a seal.

1957
01:19:25.44 --> 01:19:26.44
You're a good seal.

1958
01:19:26.44 --> 01:19:28.44
Every friend we have are seals.

1959
01:19:28.44 --> 01:19:32.44
I'm not going to give that up for you just to become another crummy lawyer.

1960
01:19:32.44 --> 01:19:34.44
Sorry counselors.

1961
01:19:34.44 --> 01:19:38.44
But so, so I just said, you know, I feel like any good husband.

1962
01:19:38.44 --> 01:19:39.44
Okay.

1963
01:19:39.44 --> 01:19:43.44
So I just decided to, you know, jump back in with both feet.

1964
01:19:43.44 --> 01:19:46.44
And then, you know, you take it as it comes.

1965
01:19:46.44 --> 01:19:48.44
You know, at the 20 year point,

1966
01:19:48.44 --> 01:19:51.44
we've all got to decide whether or not we're going to retire.

1967
01:19:51.44 --> 01:19:55.44
But as you know, the service is like they put that carrot out for funny.

1968
01:19:55.44 --> 01:19:57.44
You know, okay, I'll take that promotion.

1969
01:19:57.44 --> 01:19:58.44
And then I'll get out.

1970
01:19:58.44 --> 01:20:00.44
Then they put it on the car.

1971
01:20:00.44 --> 01:20:02.44
Next to, you know, you're old and ugly.

1972
01:20:02.44 --> 01:20:05.44
And you got 36 years into the Navy.

1973
01:20:05.44 --> 01:20:08.44
So was that your, was that your ex-O tour at STV team?

1974
01:20:08.44 --> 01:20:09.44
It was.

1975
01:20:09.44 --> 01:20:10.44
It was.

1976
01:20:10.44 --> 01:20:15.44
And at a lot of time, it's see, you know, onboard the submarines and do an operations.

1977
01:20:15.44 --> 01:20:17.44
So yeah, that was good.

1978
01:20:17.44 --> 01:20:22.44
That really was a really, really good tour.

1979
01:20:22.44 --> 01:20:23.44
Really become.

1980
01:20:23.44 --> 01:20:26.44
Was that was the first deployment that we ever made with the direct ex-Oltre.

1981
01:20:26.44 --> 01:20:29.44
And you know, when you do do the first,

1982
01:20:29.44 --> 01:20:30.44
There's nothing.

1983
01:20:30.44 --> 01:20:32.44
You mean, you had to write everything.

1984
01:20:32.44 --> 01:20:34.44
You had to write the tactic, techniques, procedures.

1985
01:20:34.44 --> 01:20:39.44
And procedures working from a submarine or life in death procedures.

1986
01:20:39.44 --> 01:20:39.44
Yeah.

1987
01:20:39.44 --> 01:20:42.44
And you really had to know and be extremely cautious.

1988
01:20:42.44 --> 01:20:44.44
And it really was the unknowns.

1989
01:20:44.44 --> 01:20:47.44
And you just think, you go back and forth.

1990
01:20:47.44 --> 01:20:52.44
And in the community, you know, we, we are a risk-taking community,

1991
01:20:52.44 --> 01:20:55.44
But you never take a risk you don't have to.

1992
01:20:55.44 --> 01:20:58.44
So we really had to put, you know, wasn't cons and most,

1993
01:20:58.44 --> 01:20:59.44
Experienn folks.

1994
01:20:59.44 --> 01:21:02.44
And then sometimes, honestly, pretty much we knew it.

1995
01:21:02.44 --> 01:21:05.44
It's going to be okay, but you're still rolling the dice sometimes.

1996
01:21:05.44 --> 01:21:09.44
But to credit really belongs to those guys, you know,

1997
01:21:09.44 --> 01:21:12.44
the pilot navigator and the STVs.

1998
01:21:12.44 --> 01:21:17.44
To be able to go from a nuclear submarine submerged in the middle of the ocean

1999
01:21:17.44 --> 01:21:23.44
and go into a target and come back ten hours plus later

2000
01:21:23.44 --> 01:21:27.44
and find that submarine is a remarkable feat.

2001
01:21:27.44 --> 01:21:28.44
It really is.

2002
01:21:28.44 --> 01:21:32.44
So, you know, really the credit goes to those young operators.

2003
01:21:32.44 --> 01:21:33.44
Hard men.

2004
01:21:33.44 --> 01:21:36.44
I still think that, you know, that is probably among our hardest

2005
01:21:36.44 --> 01:21:37.44
missions that we've got.

2006
01:21:37.44 --> 01:21:40.44
And as you know, there is not a wetsuit thick enough.

2007
01:21:40.44 --> 01:21:43.44
To keep you warm.

2008
01:21:43.44 --> 01:21:45.44
And so then what?

2009
01:21:45.44 --> 01:21:48.44
Did you go, is that when you went to detailer after you got done with that tour?

2010
01:21:48.44 --> 01:21:49.44
You became a team.

2011
01:21:49.44 --> 01:21:51.44
No, I became the maritime-special purpose force commander.

2012
01:21:51.44 --> 01:21:52.44
Oh, yes, yes.

2013
01:21:52.44 --> 01:21:57.44
So I deployed for a year with, you know, the marine detachment

2014
01:21:57.44 --> 01:22:00.44
and with art detachment and got over to the Mediterranean.

2015
01:22:00.44 --> 01:22:04.44
Got involved with another submarine operation there for the evacuation

2016
01:22:04.44 --> 01:22:06.44
of the embassy in Bay Root.

2017
01:22:06.44 --> 01:22:07.44
Oh, okay.

2018
01:22:07.44 --> 01:22:11.44
So, as this was the second time that I was in Bay Root, I evacuated

2019
01:22:11.44 --> 01:22:14.44
when I was in Enson on board the ship in 1976.

2020
01:22:14.44 --> 01:22:16.44
Because they were at war.

2021
01:22:16.44 --> 01:22:20.44
And the ship pulled in a middle of the night and all the bay was on fire.

2022
01:22:20.44 --> 01:22:25.44
And the Palestinian liberation authority gave us permission.

2023
01:22:25.44 --> 01:22:29.44
You know, be able to have one boat command and a junior officer

2024
01:22:29.44 --> 01:22:33.44
to take the Americans out to conclude the United States ambassador.

2025
01:22:33.44 --> 01:22:37.44
And I'm in my whites with my little shoulder boards and, you know,

2026
01:22:37.44 --> 01:22:41.44
they're the PLO or pulling these guys out from line,

2027
01:22:41.44 --> 01:22:43.44
not let them get on board or our boat.

2028
01:22:43.44 --> 01:22:46.44
I'm on the walkie-talkie-callin' back to the ship and talk it to the XO.

2029
01:22:46.44 --> 01:22:48.44
I said, sir, you know, they're pulling people out.

2030
01:22:48.44 --> 01:22:50.44
Just don't do anything we could do.

2031
01:22:50.44 --> 01:22:51.44
Don't do a thing, Joe.

2032
01:22:51.44 --> 01:22:53.44
Just don't leave that boat.

2033
01:22:53.44 --> 01:22:56.44
And, you know, don't do anything till the Americans are on board.

2034
01:22:56.44 --> 01:22:57.44
The embassy does on board.

2035
01:22:57.44 --> 01:23:02.44
But it really to me, this was in July of 1976 with the, you know,

2036
01:23:02.44 --> 01:23:05.44
200th anniversary of our nation.

2037
01:23:05.44 --> 01:23:08.44
And I think, and here we are, the United States of America,

2038
01:23:08.44 --> 01:23:11.44
and we've got these folks dictating to the American ambassador,

2039
01:23:11.44 --> 01:23:13.44
who represent the President of the United States and us,

2040
01:23:13.44 --> 01:23:16.44
whether or not he can go to an unbored and else you.

2041
01:23:16.44 --> 01:23:20.44
And that was a pretty defining moment for me.

2042
01:23:20.44 --> 01:23:26.44
But so then, we did it again at that time frame.

2043
01:23:26.44 --> 01:23:31.44
And I had the opportunity to go back to Bay Route

2044
01:23:31.44 --> 01:23:34.44
when I was the so-com commander with the J-Saw Commander.

2045
01:23:34.44 --> 01:23:37.44
And I had lunch with the Lebanese commandos.

2046
01:23:37.44 --> 01:23:40.44
And it was a great lunch, was sitting there.

2047
01:23:40.44 --> 01:23:44.44
And I'm talking to the Lebanese commander who's hosting the lunch.

2048
01:23:44.44 --> 01:23:50.44
I said, well, I'll tell you, General, this is my fourth trip to Bay Route.

2049
01:23:50.44 --> 01:23:53.44
And the other three times I've been here,

2050
01:23:53.44 --> 01:23:58.44
I never spent more than an hour out of the three trips.

2051
01:23:58.44 --> 01:24:02.44
And I said, well, we're in and out. And I, you know, so we spent probably,

2052
01:24:02.44 --> 01:24:04.44
you know, better part of a day there in Bay Route.

2053
01:24:04.44 --> 01:24:08.44
But it was just interesting when I went into 1976 to see it as a

2054
01:24:08.44 --> 01:24:09.44
collapsed city on fire.

2055
01:24:09.44 --> 01:24:13.44
And it go back in, in the 2019, I guess.

2056
01:24:13.44 --> 01:24:18.44
And just see it, it looks like Hong Kong, except that they're bankrupt.

2057
01:24:18.44 --> 01:24:24.44
But, no, it's funny how, from Ensign to political appointee.

2058
01:24:24.44 --> 01:24:27.44
But it all, you know, it's always been a trouble spot.

2059
01:24:27.44 --> 01:24:31.44
But what was the, when you, when you went there and pulled guys out or

2060
01:24:31.44 --> 01:24:33.44
did the embassy evacuation with from a submarine?

2061
01:24:33.44 --> 01:24:35.44
What was that operation like?

2062
01:24:35.44 --> 01:24:37.44
We can't talk about that, right?

2063
01:24:37.44 --> 01:24:39.44
Yeah, yeah.

2064
01:24:39.44 --> 01:24:41.44
So the one was after that.

2065
01:24:41.44 --> 01:24:45.44
So you did that, just wanted it with the, with the, with the, as the special

2066
01:24:45.44 --> 01:24:46.44
force commander.

2067
01:24:46.44 --> 01:24:50.44
Yep. And then, and then from there, up to D.C.

2068
01:24:50.44 --> 01:24:53.44
So it was my first Washington tour.

2069
01:24:53.44 --> 01:24:57.44
And as the assignment and placement officer for the community.

2070
01:24:57.44 --> 01:24:59.44
And it was an awful lot of fun.

2071
01:24:59.44 --> 01:25:03.44
That, you know, you're the one person in all community, making all assignments from

2072
01:25:03.44 --> 01:25:05.44
Ensign to captains.

2073
01:25:05.44 --> 01:25:07.44
And everybody hates you.

2074
01:25:07.44 --> 01:25:11.44
Hard to believe, isn't it?

2075
01:25:11.44 --> 01:25:15.44
But that was, that was a really good one.

2076
01:25:15.44 --> 01:25:17.44
I did the best I could, even the playing field and, and, and,

2077
01:25:17.44 --> 01:25:19.44
distribute.

2078
01:25:19.44 --> 01:25:22.44
But the other thing is, I had an opportunity to,

2079
01:25:22.44 --> 01:25:24.44
to work and serve on selection boards.

2080
01:25:24.44 --> 01:25:27.44
So you're a junior officer and you're supporting the, the senior

2081
01:25:27.44 --> 01:25:31.44
of the captains, and the admels as they make their selections.

2082
01:25:31.44 --> 01:25:34.44
And you see the selection board process.

2083
01:25:34.44 --> 01:25:38.44
And then you see who gets selected and who doesn't get selected.

2084
01:25:38.44 --> 01:25:41.44
And you can just sit back there after a while and go.

2085
01:25:41.44 --> 01:25:43.44
Don't sweat the low, man.

2086
01:25:43.44 --> 01:25:44.44
Just do your job.

2087
01:25:44.44 --> 01:25:45.44
It's as simple as that.

2088
01:25:45.44 --> 01:25:48.44
You know, because everybody's record, you know, when they're up for flag,

2089
01:25:48.44 --> 01:25:50.44
just about every one of those captains,

2090
01:25:50.44 --> 01:25:53.44
they're records of like manicured lawns.

2091
01:25:53.44 --> 01:25:55.44
But not everybody's going to get it.

2092
01:25:55.44 --> 01:25:57.44
And it's just, it doesn't matter.

2093
01:25:57.44 --> 01:25:59.44
If you're going to get it, you're going to get it.

2094
01:25:59.44 --> 01:26:01.44
But if not, just relax and just do your job.

2095
01:26:01.44 --> 01:26:03.44
And really took an awful lot of pressure off there.

2096
01:26:03.44 --> 01:26:07.44
But, um, yeah, that was a time, uh, that,

2097
01:26:07.44 --> 01:26:12.44
then we went up with, um, uh, first go for.

2098
01:26:12.44 --> 01:26:15.44
So I went up leaving there and going down to,

2099
01:26:15.44 --> 01:26:18.44
uh, devgrew is the deputy commander.

2100
01:26:18.44 --> 01:26:21.44
And then how many years have you spent down there?

2101
01:26:21.44 --> 01:26:23.44
I spent two years down there.

2102
01:26:23.44 --> 01:26:27.44
And then, uh, left to take over a commanding officer's shield team too.

2103
01:26:27.44 --> 01:26:30.44
Now, during this time, would you say that this is a time where, you know,

2104
01:26:30.44 --> 01:26:33.44
you had, uh, the first go for what happened.

2105
01:26:33.44 --> 01:26:37.44
Our seal start to kind of, kind of become popular yet.

2106
01:26:37.44 --> 01:26:40.44
I mean, I came in in 1991 as we mentioned, as I mentioned earlier.

2107
01:26:40.44 --> 01:26:43.44
I mean, there was the, the Navy seals movie,

2108
01:26:43.44 --> 01:26:45.44
which I'm sure echoed Charles likes.

2109
01:26:45.44 --> 01:26:48.44
The Navy seals movie, I think, came out in 1991.

2110
01:26:48.44 --> 01:26:50.44
Yeah, I'd be a makes eye Chuck Farge movie.

2111
01:26:50.44 --> 01:26:51.44
Yeah. Yeah.

2112
01:26:51.44 --> 01:26:55.44
But there was still not a lot of, not a lot of popularity.

2113
01:26:55.44 --> 01:26:56.44
It wasn't a big deal yet.

2114
01:26:56.44 --> 01:26:59.44
No. So, you know, um, um,

2115
01:26:59.44 --> 01:27:02.44
don't want to have a history lesson for everybody out there.

2116
01:27:02.44 --> 01:27:06.44
But, uh, because of the failure of the Iranian hostage, uh,

2117
01:27:06.44 --> 01:27:09.44
rescue mission, uh, in April of 1980,

2118
01:27:09.44 --> 01:27:14.44
and then compounded by what happened in Grenada, um,

2119
01:27:14.44 --> 01:27:17.44
that, uh, to civilian side of the house,

2120
01:27:17.44 --> 01:27:19.44
you know, made the decision that,

2121
01:27:19.44 --> 01:27:23.44
especially because of the failure of the Iranian hostage rescue mission,

2122
01:27:23.44 --> 01:27:26.44
that if we as a nation want to have an organization

2123
01:27:26.44 --> 01:27:28.44
that be able to conduct no fail missions,

2124
01:27:28.44 --> 01:27:30.44
that we need to be serious about this,

2125
01:27:30.44 --> 01:27:33.44
and there has to be one command that's organized,

2126
01:27:33.44 --> 01:27:36.44
trained and equipped to be able to do that.

2127
01:27:36.44 --> 01:27:39.44
That started shaping the, the community.

2128
01:27:39.44 --> 01:27:41.44
But we were still in the Navy, the Army was still in the army,

2129
01:27:41.44 --> 01:27:46.44
and through the Department of Defense Propheation Act of a 1987,

2130
01:27:46.44 --> 01:27:51.44
senators none and co-in tacked on the end of that appropriations bill,

2131
01:27:51.44 --> 01:27:54.44
the establishment of the United States Special Operations Command,

2132
01:27:54.44 --> 01:27:57.44
and bringing in the Navy seals,

2133
01:27:57.44 --> 01:28:00.44
army special forces, Rangers, and, and, and, and, and,

2134
01:28:00.44 --> 01:28:05.44
uh, one 60th, uh, and Air Force Commandos under the United States Special Operations Command.

2135
01:28:05.44 --> 01:28:10.44
So then we had our own line of, uh, of money for, for, for, for,

2136
01:28:10.44 --> 01:28:15.44
for, for, for unique, but be honest with you, um, at that time, uh,

2137
01:28:15.44 --> 01:28:19.44
my friend Tom Colter, who mentioned that, you know,

2138
01:28:19.44 --> 01:28:22.44
okay, once once the seals came into the United States Special Operations Command,

2139
01:28:22.44 --> 01:28:24.44
Tommy goes, well, congratulations.

2140
01:28:24.44 --> 01:28:26.44
When now in the bottom of two food chains,

2141
01:28:26.44 --> 01:28:28.44
hahahaha.

2142
01:28:28.44 --> 01:28:32.44
Pretty much we worry, you know, uh, but, um,

2143
01:28:32.44 --> 01:28:37.44
uh, we still, in spite of that, uh, the resources didn't flow.

2144
01:28:37.44 --> 01:28:41.44
And, um, uh, the active duty military did not necessarily want to have this,

2145
01:28:41.44 --> 01:28:45.44
and if they did, they wanted to have it three star command,

2146
01:28:45.44 --> 01:28:47.44
you know, it's close to Washington.

2147
01:28:47.44 --> 01:28:50.44
And it was our civilians, uh, that said, no, we know the military.

2148
01:28:50.44 --> 01:28:54.44
It's got to be a four star, and, um, well, actually probably had an awful

2149
01:28:54.44 --> 01:28:56.44
lot to do with a powerful flow of delegation.

2150
01:28:56.44 --> 01:28:59.44
Well, they think else that we want of an, it make it ill.

2151
01:28:59.44 --> 01:29:03.44
But, um, it took quite a while, and we would just be coming.

2152
01:29:03.44 --> 01:29:08.44
And, uh, but, uh, the leaders of the community made very, very good decisions

2153
01:29:08.44 --> 01:29:14.44
on what the limited resources we had, uh, and we had other opportunities

2154
01:29:14.44 --> 01:29:20.44
to do away with certain types of things that we as a community did.

2155
01:29:20.44 --> 01:29:23.44
And one of them was, you know, unconventional warfare that, uh,

2156
01:29:23.44 --> 01:29:26.44
the special, the green berets were going to do away with that.

2157
01:29:26.44 --> 01:29:30.44
And luckily, they decided not to, so when 9-11 happened,

2158
01:29:30.44 --> 01:29:33.44
and they were able to send the fifth special forces in, you know,

2159
01:29:33.44 --> 01:29:36.44
with John Mulholland, does the group commander and the other young folks

2160
01:29:36.44 --> 01:29:42.44
that wound up being the horse soldiers, but that war was the defining thing

2161
01:29:42.44 --> 01:29:47.44
for the community. Unfortunately, we pay the heavy toll to be where we are today.

2162
01:29:47.44 --> 01:29:54.44
But, uh, when the opportunity presented itself for both Afghanistan and Iraq,

2163
01:29:54.44 --> 01:30:00.44
um, special operations, mentality and capability was at a premium,

2164
01:30:00.44 --> 01:30:03.44
and we were ready at that time to do that.

2165
01:30:03.44 --> 01:30:07.44
And luckily, the active duty military had come around,

2166
01:30:07.44 --> 01:30:12.44
as well as the scene just civilians, and completely changed the resource

2167
01:30:12.44 --> 01:30:14.44
for the United States Special Operations Command,

2168
01:30:14.44 --> 01:30:18.44
and I have to say really gave us all the tools necessary and bed

2169
01:30:18.44 --> 01:30:21.44
over backwards to make us as successful as we possibly could be.

2170
01:30:21.44 --> 01:30:24.44
And we were carrying all the water.

2171
01:30:24.44 --> 01:30:29.44
And, um, so, um, she said, back then, nobody knew who we were.

2172
01:30:29.44 --> 01:30:35.44
Now, everybody knows who we are, but that also has got to do with the tax that we paid

2173
01:30:35.44 --> 01:30:39.44
and the brave people that you mentioned a little bit earlier, who, you know.

2174
01:30:39.44 --> 01:30:44.44
And if I could talk about that just a little bit, um, with Mark Lee and Ryan,

2175
01:30:44.44 --> 01:30:51.44
so, you know, Jockel mentioned about me welcoming the, the men home from combat,

2176
01:30:51.44 --> 01:30:56.44
but I also, Jockel was already deployed to Iraq, and I would also see all of the guys

2177
01:30:56.44 --> 01:30:59.44
off before they got to the plane and left.

2178
01:30:59.44 --> 01:31:02.44
So, Jockel's got a bunch of guys from his task unit.

2179
01:31:02.44 --> 01:31:04.44
I didn't want to bother them. They're talking to their wives,

2180
01:31:04.44 --> 01:31:07.44
and that is time to kind of go out to the plane.

2181
01:31:07.44 --> 01:31:10.44
And, um, so we're standing around when other plane has said,

2182
01:31:10.44 --> 01:31:12.44
look, guys, one last thing.

2183
01:31:12.44 --> 01:31:17.44
I said, the genies here, rub the lamp, make your wish, you know.

2184
01:31:17.44 --> 01:31:24.44
And, and, guys, some folks have reluctant to talk to a guy with two stars in his collar.

2185
01:31:24.44 --> 01:31:28.44
And now, Mark Lee was a new guy. This was his first deployment.

2186
01:31:28.44 --> 01:31:31.44
And, Mark Lee comes up, he says, hey, Admiral, we talked to you.

2187
01:31:31.44 --> 01:31:33.44
All right, what is it there, Petty obviously?

2188
01:31:33.44 --> 01:31:37.44
Is he, you know, rover there, we'll fight in the war, and with these home fees,

2189
01:31:37.44 --> 01:31:38.44
and these home fees are not air conditioned.

2190
01:31:38.44 --> 01:31:40.44
We need air conditioned home fees.

2191
01:31:40.44 --> 01:31:45.44
Well, Mark, I tell you what, you know, you're in a war,

2192
01:31:45.44 --> 01:31:48.44
and you just can't stick an air conditioner in there because of a bomb goes off.

2193
01:31:48.44 --> 01:31:51.44
You might wind up eating it. So, let me do this.

2194
01:31:51.44 --> 01:31:53.44
Let me go to the United States Special Operations Command.

2195
01:31:53.44 --> 01:31:57.44
I'll talk to General Brown and see what we can do.

2196
01:31:57.44 --> 01:31:59.44
And, I went back to my office. I called General Doug Brown,

2197
01:31:59.44 --> 01:32:02.44
who was our so-called commander. He says, look, got it. I got it.

2198
01:32:02.44 --> 01:32:04.44
That was his big one. I got it.

2199
01:32:04.44 --> 01:32:06.44
They said, but we have to do this smart.

2200
01:32:06.44 --> 01:32:10.44
And we wound up with air conditioned home fees in Iraq

2201
01:32:10.44 --> 01:32:13.44
because Markly asked for that.

2202
01:32:13.44 --> 01:32:20.44
Now, to me, you know, as the Admiral, you work for the men.

2203
01:32:20.44 --> 01:32:25.44
And if that's what they needed, that's what they got.

2204
01:32:25.44 --> 01:32:31.44
But one of the most moving things in my life was when Mark came home

2205
01:32:31.44 --> 01:32:34.44
to San Diego.

2206
01:32:34.44 --> 01:32:38.44
So, when you come home, you get flown into Dover,

2207
01:32:38.44 --> 01:32:42.44
and then from Dover to San Diego.

2208
01:32:42.44 --> 01:32:45.44
So, there were a bunch of us that went down there to meet his body

2209
01:32:45.44 --> 01:32:47.44
as it came off this commercial plane.

2210
01:32:47.44 --> 01:32:51.44
And there were folks at San Diego Airport.

2211
01:32:51.44 --> 01:32:55.44
We're very kind to us and let us, you know, come down.

2212
01:32:55.44 --> 01:32:58.44
So, now everybody had to remain on board the plane

2213
01:32:58.44 --> 01:33:02.44
with the exception of our escort officers that escort Mark's body back.

2214
01:33:02.44 --> 01:33:09.44
And I'm down there with the Master Chief and the body comes off.

2215
01:33:09.44 --> 01:33:16.44
And I mean, all of a sudden, I realize it's dead silent in the airport.

2216
01:33:16.44 --> 01:33:19.44
There's no planes moving, there's no cars moving.

2217
01:33:19.44 --> 01:33:22.44
I mean, I just, I was so focused on the coffin coming off.

2218
01:33:22.44 --> 01:33:28.44
And I look up in the terminal and everybody's pressed against the glass.

2219
01:33:28.44 --> 01:33:33.44
I mean, everywhere. And one of the airport,

2220
01:33:33.44 --> 01:33:36.44
what's going on? He said, we stopped everything.

2221
01:33:36.44 --> 01:33:38.44
We stopped everything.

2222
01:33:38.44 --> 01:33:40.44
And they made a announcement in the airport.

2223
01:33:40.44 --> 01:33:43.44
The first seal who was killed in Iraq is coming home.

2224
01:33:43.44 --> 01:33:45.44
One of we all go out there and welcome a home.

2225
01:33:45.44 --> 01:33:49.44
And that really, that was remarkable.

2226
01:33:49.44 --> 01:33:53.44
And as far as, you know, Ryan Joe,

2227
01:33:53.44 --> 01:33:55.44
I mean, you had to know Ryan folks.

2228
01:33:55.44 --> 01:33:59.44
So, I mean, Ryan was just indomitable, absolutely indomitable.

2229
01:33:59.44 --> 01:34:05.44
So now here he lost his vision and he's in Bethesda Naval Hospital.

2230
01:34:05.44 --> 01:34:10.44
So I just coincidentally, I had to, it was going to be there anyhow

2231
01:34:10.44 --> 01:34:15.44
because we had a Navy Cross ceremony for two of our seals

2232
01:34:15.44 --> 01:34:20.44
that were with Michael Murphy in Operation Red Wings,

2233
01:34:20.44 --> 01:34:23.44
who were killed and they were posthumously receiving the Navy Cross.

2234
01:34:23.44 --> 01:34:26.44
We had a big ceremony planned at the Navy Memorial.

2235
01:34:26.44 --> 01:34:30.44
So, a few of us in town, we go to visit Ryan,

2236
01:34:30.44 --> 01:34:33.44
who is Bethesda Naval Hospital.

2237
01:34:33.44 --> 01:34:37.44
Now, we go there and cat these with me,

2238
01:34:37.44 --> 01:34:40.44
and he's asleep and there's a woman there.

2239
01:34:40.44 --> 01:34:42.44
Turns out to be Ryan's mother.

2240
01:34:42.44 --> 01:34:43.44
Right?

2241
01:34:43.44 --> 01:34:47.44
So, go up and he wakes up.

2242
01:34:47.44 --> 01:34:49.44
Hey, hey, guys.

2243
01:34:49.44 --> 01:34:52.44
So, of course, all the knuckleheads go in.

2244
01:34:52.44 --> 01:34:55.44
And we start talking now, he's blind.

2245
01:34:55.44 --> 01:34:58.44
But he's himself.

2246
01:34:58.44 --> 01:34:59.44
And so...

2247
01:34:59.44 --> 01:35:00.44
So, then maybe a little more.

2248
01:35:00.44 --> 01:35:01.44
Yeah.

2249
01:35:01.44 --> 01:35:02.44
Yeah.

2250
01:35:02.44 --> 01:35:03.44
I don't know.

2251
01:35:03.44 --> 01:35:05.44
I don't know who did this.

2252
01:35:05.44 --> 01:35:09.44
Now, we're talking, you know, Mrs. Job and you know, we take a carry a son.

2253
01:35:09.44 --> 01:35:11.44
And we still didn't know what his disposition was going to be.

2254
01:35:11.44 --> 01:35:13.44
I mean, he just came out of combat.

2255
01:35:13.44 --> 01:35:15.44
He only went to the hospital for a couple of days.

2256
01:35:15.44 --> 01:35:19.44
And so, somebody says to him, hey, Ryan,

2257
01:35:19.44 --> 01:35:23.44
we're going to have a major ceremony at the Navy Memorial for the couple of guys.

2258
01:35:23.44 --> 01:35:24.44
They're receiving the Navy Cross.

2259
01:35:24.44 --> 01:35:25.44
You want to come?

2260
01:35:25.44 --> 01:35:27.44
Yeah, I'm in.

2261
01:35:27.44 --> 01:35:29.44
Now, he's blind, so he can't see this.

2262
01:35:29.44 --> 01:35:33.44
His mother just points to me with the old you outside.

2263
01:35:33.44 --> 01:35:36.44
So, she drags me into the lobby.

2264
01:35:36.44 --> 01:35:39.44
And she has got her fingers in my chest.

2265
01:35:39.44 --> 01:35:40.44
Right?

2266
01:35:40.44 --> 01:35:42.44
My son just lost his vision.

2267
01:35:42.44 --> 01:35:43.44
Yes, Mrs. Job.

2268
01:35:43.44 --> 01:35:44.44
I got you.

2269
01:35:44.44 --> 01:35:45.44
Yes, Mrs. Job.

2270
01:35:45.44 --> 01:35:46.44
We got you.

2271
01:35:46.44 --> 01:35:48.44
So, I said, Mrs. Job, I'm not sure.

2272
01:35:48.44 --> 01:35:51.44
But if our team ate once to go.

2273
01:35:51.44 --> 01:35:52.44
I mean, it's up to you.

2274
01:35:52.44 --> 01:35:53.44
I'm not going to get involved.

2275
01:35:53.44 --> 01:35:56.44
But I guarantee you, we will have a car for him.

2276
01:35:56.44 --> 01:35:57.44
We will have a place for him.

2277
01:35:57.44 --> 01:36:01.44
And we will have a big, bad seal who will escort him.

2278
01:36:01.44 --> 01:36:03.44
Do you remember who you sent home to be as escort?

2279
01:36:03.44 --> 01:36:04.44
I sent three guys home.

2280
01:36:04.44 --> 01:36:05.44
I'm not sure which one.

2281
01:36:05.44 --> 01:36:07.44
One was the American Snack.

2282
01:36:07.44 --> 01:36:08.44
But, right?

2283
01:36:08.44 --> 01:36:11.44
So, so, I don't know what's going to happen.

2284
01:36:11.44 --> 01:36:15.44
But I mean, this is a very moving thing because we got the cold star family.

2285
01:36:15.44 --> 01:36:18.44
They're and everybody was there.

2286
01:36:18.44 --> 01:36:21.44
It was a sunset ceremony in Washington, D.C.

2287
01:36:21.44 --> 01:36:26.44
And the Secretary of the Navy, the Chief and Naval Operations,

2288
01:36:26.44 --> 01:36:30.44
all of Washington Senators, and that come out.

2289
01:36:30.44 --> 01:36:32.44
And the lights are on me.

2290
01:36:32.44 --> 01:36:34.44
And it's a semi-circle amphitheater.

2291
01:36:34.44 --> 01:36:36.44
And as I'm talking, welcoming everybody,

2292
01:36:36.44 --> 01:36:38.44
I start over the right.

2293
01:36:38.44 --> 01:36:39.44
Where is he?

2294
01:36:39.44 --> 01:36:40.44
Where is he?

2295
01:36:40.44 --> 01:36:41.44
Where is he?

2296
01:36:41.44 --> 01:36:43.44
And as I'm talking, I'm skinned the crowd.

2297
01:36:43.44 --> 01:36:45.44
And all the way over the left at an end seat.

2298
01:36:45.44 --> 01:36:48.44
There's one individual who has his head turned to the side.

2299
01:36:48.44 --> 01:36:52.44
And I realize it's Ryan's who he can hear me.

2300
01:36:52.44 --> 01:36:54.44
And I'm kind of looking.

2301
01:36:54.44 --> 01:36:56.44
I figured, right?

2302
01:36:56.44 --> 01:36:58.44
And then who stands up behind him?

2303
01:36:58.44 --> 01:36:59.44
Right?

2304
01:36:59.44 --> 01:37:00.44
I got him.

2305
01:37:00.44 --> 01:37:01.44
Chris?

2306
01:37:01.44 --> 01:37:02.44
I got him.

2307
01:37:02.44 --> 01:37:03.44
Chris Kyle.

2308
01:37:03.44 --> 01:37:04.44
I got him.

2309
01:37:04.44 --> 01:37:05.44
Okay, he's in Goon Shreak there.

2310
01:37:05.44 --> 01:37:06.44
You know?

2311
01:37:06.44 --> 01:37:08.44
So, we went through that.

2312
01:37:08.44 --> 01:37:10.44
And I got to tell you,

2313
01:37:10.44 --> 01:37:14.44
there's Sir Money who is moving, but we had a reception after that.

2314
01:37:14.44 --> 01:37:17.44
And then we went down, and then they do memorial for reception.

2315
01:37:17.44 --> 01:37:20.44
And you know, don't frogman that we are.

2316
01:37:20.44 --> 01:37:22.44
You know, we got, you know, he's blind.

2317
01:37:22.44 --> 01:37:23.44
Put him in a chair.

2318
01:37:23.44 --> 01:37:26.44
So it was almost like animal house when they come in to Delta House.

2319
01:37:26.44 --> 01:37:28.44
You've got the nerves that they just got to stick to the side.

2320
01:37:28.44 --> 01:37:29.44
Just sit, you know.

2321
01:37:29.44 --> 01:37:31.44
So we keep trying to get Ryan this.

2322
01:37:31.44 --> 01:37:37.44
And meanwhile, keep in mind, he two weeks since he's lost his vision.

2323
01:37:37.44 --> 01:37:40.44
And there are hundreds of people there.

2324
01:37:40.44 --> 01:37:42.44
And he's just walking around the crowd.

2325
01:37:42.44 --> 01:37:43.44
And of course, I'm on him now.

2326
01:37:43.44 --> 01:37:45.44
And everybody's going to all of them.

2327
01:37:45.44 --> 01:37:48.44
And he bumps into this woman.

2328
01:37:48.44 --> 01:37:50.44
And you know, he goes, oh, excuse me.

2329
01:37:50.44 --> 01:37:51.44
You know, hi.

2330
01:37:51.44 --> 01:37:52.44
I'm Ryan.

2331
01:37:52.44 --> 01:37:53.44
Who are you?

2332
01:37:53.44 --> 01:37:54.44
I'm Ryan.

2333
01:37:54.44 --> 01:37:55.44
I'm Barbara Boxer.

2334
01:37:55.44 --> 01:37:59.44
He'd have a clue that it was a senator.

2335
01:37:59.44 --> 01:38:01.44
And he just got shot in a rope.

2336
01:38:01.44 --> 01:38:03.44
I think it might God.

2337
01:38:03.44 --> 01:38:04.44
You know?

2338
01:38:04.44 --> 01:38:07.44
So it was a wonderful reception.

2339
01:38:07.44 --> 01:38:10.44
And I stayed to the last gold star parent left.

2340
01:38:10.44 --> 01:38:11.44
And I'm fried.

2341
01:38:11.44 --> 01:38:12.44
I got to be honest with you.

2342
01:38:12.44 --> 01:38:14.44
Because I had to do Navy business there at the day.

2343
01:38:14.44 --> 01:38:15.44
And you're on it.

2344
01:38:15.44 --> 01:38:16.44
And it was emotional.

2345
01:38:16.44 --> 01:38:17.44
It's going to be.

2346
01:38:17.44 --> 01:38:18.44
Because you can land that emotionally.

2347
01:38:18.44 --> 01:38:19.44
It's just raining.

2348
01:38:19.44 --> 01:38:27.44
So I figured if it was Danny Deets' family or Axelson's family, that left the last.

2349
01:38:27.44 --> 01:38:30.44
And I just figured, okay, I turned to Kathy.

2350
01:38:30.44 --> 01:38:31.44
I said, alright.

2351
01:38:31.44 --> 01:38:33.44
Maybe let's get back to the hotel.

2352
01:38:33.44 --> 01:38:35.44
She says, all you're a men.

2353
01:38:35.44 --> 01:38:37.44
Or at the Irish pub.

2354
01:38:37.44 --> 01:38:40.44
You gotta go have at least to be with the boys.

2355
01:38:40.44 --> 01:38:43.44
You know, my name is Bokwara.

2356
01:38:43.44 --> 01:38:46.44
So I went to this bar.

2357
01:38:46.44 --> 01:38:48.44
And it is packed.

2358
01:38:48.44 --> 01:38:49.44
Pact.

2359
01:38:49.44 --> 01:38:53.44
So of course the guys would be a nice to kind of make a way for me and Kathy.

2360
01:38:53.44 --> 01:38:59.44
And up against the bar with the beer in his hand and his elbow on the bar is Ryan Jo.

2361
01:38:59.44 --> 01:39:00.44
Drink it up beer.

2362
01:39:00.44 --> 01:39:03.44
Just be one of the boys.

2363
01:39:03.44 --> 01:39:09.44
But what are my favorite stories about Ryan after he got medically retired?

2364
01:39:09.44 --> 01:39:14.44
He became very good friends with our four star commander, General Doug Brown.

2365
01:39:14.44 --> 01:39:17.44
And so he calls up General Brown.

2366
01:39:17.44 --> 01:39:21.44
And he says, hey, sir, I'm going to climb Mount McKinley.

2367
01:39:21.44 --> 01:39:24.44
I like you to come with me.

2368
01:39:24.44 --> 01:39:29.44
Well, you know, Ryan, I'm in my 60s right now.

2369
01:39:29.44 --> 01:39:31.44
I don't know if I could do that.

2370
01:39:31.44 --> 01:39:35.44
General Brown told me to see cause General Brown, I'm blind.

2371
01:39:35.44 --> 01:39:37.44
You've got no excuse.

2372
01:39:37.44 --> 01:39:39.44
So just, I mean, he has a,

2373
01:39:39.44 --> 01:39:41.44
Indominable, just wonderful.

2374
01:39:41.44 --> 01:39:42.44
Just an inspiration.

2375
01:39:42.44 --> 01:39:43.44
Yeah.

2376
01:39:43.44 --> 01:39:45.44
One inspiration, both to Chris Chris as well.

2377
01:39:45.44 --> 01:39:46.44
An inspirational person.

2378
01:39:46.44 --> 01:39:49.44
Yeah, I remember, you know, he said he was medically retired.

2379
01:39:49.44 --> 01:39:52.44
But there was a time where he was,

2380
01:39:52.44 --> 01:39:54.44
not sure if he was going to medically retire.

2381
01:39:54.44 --> 01:39:58.44
But you know, he said to me, he said, well, you know, can I stay in?

2382
01:39:58.44 --> 01:40:02.44
And I said, well, I don't know, but I know someone that does know.

2383
01:40:02.44 --> 01:40:06.44
And I came by to see you and I said, hey, there's a chance that Ryan wants to just stay in.

2384
01:40:06.44 --> 01:40:10.44
And you looked at me and said, then he stays in.

2385
01:40:10.44 --> 01:40:11.44
Yeah.

2386
01:40:11.44 --> 01:40:14.44
And my thought was, when you look at your mirror,

2387
01:40:14.44 --> 01:40:18.44
and you see yourself, you see a seal.

2388
01:40:18.44 --> 01:40:23.44
And my thought was, I don't, and any one of us,

2389
01:40:23.44 --> 01:40:27.44
telling our teammate he no longer could do it.

2390
01:40:27.44 --> 01:40:31.44
Our teammate has to come to that realization on his own.

2391
01:40:31.44 --> 01:40:35.44
And I just thought sooner or later, you mean, it's just hard to make that break.

2392
01:40:35.44 --> 01:40:37.44
Especially, you know, you're coming from combat and going through all this stuff.

2393
01:40:37.44 --> 01:40:40.44
Sooner or later, you realize, you know,

2394
01:40:40.44 --> 01:40:43.44
because I learned that from Tommy Norris.

2395
01:40:43.44 --> 01:40:46.44
Tommy was one of our Medal of Honor recipients from Vietnam.

2396
01:40:46.44 --> 01:40:50.44
And Tommy was severely wounded.

2397
01:40:50.44 --> 01:40:52.44
But because he was a Medal of Honor recipient,

2398
01:40:52.44 --> 01:40:56.44
that, you know, Tommy, you could stay and Tommy the decision.

2399
01:40:56.44 --> 01:41:00.44
I could stay, but I don't think I'm a full up round anymore.

2400
01:41:00.44 --> 01:41:03.44
And I just, you know, so he made that decision as well.

2401
01:41:03.44 --> 01:41:05.44
So I learned that years ago, and I just thought,

2402
01:41:05.44 --> 01:41:09.44
let my teammate decide when it's time for them to go.

2403
01:41:09.44 --> 01:41:11.44
That was awesome for him to have that option.

2404
01:41:11.44 --> 01:41:15.44
And for him to know that as long as he wanted to be in the teams,

2405
01:41:15.44 --> 01:41:17.44
he would be in the teams.

2406
01:41:17.44 --> 01:41:19.44
That was his freaking awesome.

2407
01:41:19.44 --> 01:41:27.44
Where were we? We were at what? You were about to take over Seal Team 2?

2408
01:41:27.44 --> 01:41:32.44
Well, I took over Seal Team 2 and left there.

2409
01:41:32.44 --> 01:41:37.44
And I had the misfortune of getting deep selected for captain.

2410
01:41:37.44 --> 01:41:43.44
But, yeah, so I'm deployed on another submarine with the Seal Team down in the Caribbean.

2411
01:41:43.44 --> 01:41:48.44
So we've been at Seal now, probably submerged for a week.

2412
01:41:48.44 --> 01:41:51.44
And, you know, as you know, Chuck, when you finally finish,

2413
01:41:51.44 --> 01:41:56.44
you come to the surface, they put the antenna up and you're down low to traffic.

2414
01:41:56.44 --> 01:42:00.44
So we're just, we've gone admin now.

2415
01:42:00.44 --> 01:42:01.44
We're up in the Seal.

2416
01:42:01.44 --> 01:42:05.44
The submarine is running on the surface, and you know, you focus, you see pictures like that,

2417
01:42:05.44 --> 01:42:07.44
and recruiting things, where the folks are up there.

2418
01:42:07.44 --> 01:42:10.44
So I'm up in the Seal with the commanding office of the submarine,

2419
01:42:10.44 --> 01:42:14.44
and the guys are in the, just after the Seal,

2420
01:42:14.44 --> 01:42:16.44
putting our boats together and some other stuff.

2421
01:42:16.44 --> 01:42:21.44
And the sound powered phone rigs on the submarine,

2422
01:42:21.44 --> 01:42:25.44
and you know, the captain picks up the phone, you know, captain.

2423
01:42:25.44 --> 01:42:29.44
And he's listening, and he starts looking at me,

2424
01:42:29.44 --> 01:42:33.44
and I think it got what did my guys do now.

2425
01:42:33.44 --> 01:42:39.44
And he hangs up the phone, and he looks at me goes,

2426
01:42:39.44 --> 01:42:44.44
we just got a message, you just got selected for captain.

2427
01:42:44.44 --> 01:42:48.44
I said, that can't be, I'm not eligible for another two years,

2428
01:42:48.44 --> 01:42:50.44
because what's your year group?

2429
01:42:50.44 --> 01:42:52.44
I told him because, damn Joe, it sounds fine.

2430
01:42:52.44 --> 01:42:56.44
So with that, I wound up, you know,

2431
01:42:56.44 --> 01:42:59.44
not staying as long as I would have liked to,

2432
01:42:59.44 --> 01:43:02.44
but I left there, and then went to,

2433
01:43:02.44 --> 01:43:06.44
got selected for Harvard as a national security follower up there.

2434
01:43:06.44 --> 01:43:10.44
And that was another remedial education program for me.

2435
01:43:10.44 --> 01:43:13.44
You know, the project cuts me about Harvard, really.

2436
01:43:13.44 --> 01:43:17.44
I mean, it's got a good reputation, but who do the spelling counts?

2437
01:43:17.44 --> 01:43:21.44
So, how long are you up there for?

2438
01:43:21.44 --> 01:43:24.44
A giant 13 months, so it was a one year fellowship,

2439
01:43:24.44 --> 01:43:26.44
but it was remarkable.

2440
01:43:26.44 --> 01:43:31.44
So I had, I had an officer rank, I was a member of the faculty club,

2441
01:43:31.44 --> 01:43:34.44
and it was just great to be able to have my mother,

2442
01:43:34.44 --> 01:43:37.44
take my mother to the faculty club, and just tell her,

2443
01:43:37.44 --> 01:43:40.44
you know, even C students can make it to the Harvard faculty club,

2444
01:43:40.44 --> 01:43:47.44
you know, but it was really great because it was small seminars,

2445
01:43:47.44 --> 01:43:49.44
focused on what I was up there really to do

2446
01:43:49.44 --> 01:43:51.44
as advanced research in national security.

2447
01:43:51.44 --> 01:43:55.44
But the folks that I had up there at the Kennedy School

2448
01:43:55.44 --> 01:43:58.44
is really the holding tank for government.

2449
01:43:58.44 --> 01:44:01.44
They were the former Secretaries, former ambassadors,

2450
01:44:01.44 --> 01:44:05.44
and I became, because one year is sealed.

2451
01:44:05.44 --> 01:44:09.44
And I just, and had the rank that I was included

2452
01:44:09.44 --> 01:44:13.44
in everything there, just really remarkable.

2453
01:44:13.44 --> 01:44:17.44
That, you know, some of the seminars I was in,

2454
01:44:17.44 --> 01:44:20.44
I had to put a, maybe once a week,

2455
01:44:20.44 --> 01:44:23.44
because we had to take turns submitting a memorandum,

2456
01:44:23.44 --> 01:44:26.44
and then go to the two professors who,

2457
01:44:26.44 --> 01:44:29.44
one would be the former Deputy Secretary of State,

2458
01:44:29.44 --> 01:44:32.44
and then it was, you know, an under Secretary of Defense.

2459
01:44:32.44 --> 01:44:34.44
And they'd go through this don't think,

2460
01:44:34.44 --> 01:44:36.44
and they'd go, show you dope.

2461
01:44:36.44 --> 01:44:40.44
You can't say that. They're going to link that to the Washington Post.

2462
01:44:40.44 --> 01:44:43.44
And honestly, good just like, here's how you say it

2463
01:44:43.44 --> 01:44:46.44
without, you know, in dining, I mean, just really good,

2464
01:44:46.44 --> 01:44:47.44
practical stuff.

2465
01:44:47.44 --> 01:44:50.44
But because I got included in everything,

2466
01:44:50.44 --> 01:44:53.44
this is at a time when Ted Kennedy was still alive

2467
01:44:53.44 --> 01:44:55.44
and the senator from Massachusetts,

2468
01:44:55.44 --> 01:45:00.44
and John John was around, and they'd come to the Kennedy School all the time,

2469
01:45:00.44 --> 01:45:05.44
but Senator Kennedy's sister was the ambassador to Ireland.

2470
01:45:05.44 --> 01:45:10.44
And the Kennedy family invited jury atoms to come to Boston.

2471
01:45:10.44 --> 01:45:16.44
And then he gave a lecture in the evening at the Kennedy School

2472
01:45:16.44 --> 01:45:18.44
and then a small dinner.

2473
01:45:18.44 --> 01:45:21.44
So, you know, these were all, or merit as professors,

2474
01:45:21.44 --> 01:45:24.44
which I like to come Joe, boy, would I?

2475
01:45:24.44 --> 01:45:27.44
You know, and we had dinner there were only about eight of us at dinner,

2476
01:45:27.44 --> 01:45:29.44
and he was holding court.

2477
01:45:29.44 --> 01:45:31.44
And I got to tell you, I just sit there watching,

2478
01:45:31.44 --> 01:45:34.44
and they're gonna, no wonder, I mean, this guy.

2479
01:45:34.44 --> 01:45:38.44
These are all senior, merit as Harvard professors,

2480
01:45:38.44 --> 01:45:40.44
and they were eating out of his hand.

2481
01:45:40.44 --> 01:45:43.44
And I think this guy's good, this guy's real good.

2482
01:45:43.44 --> 01:45:46.44
And I said, then our four-star at that point in time,

2483
01:45:46.44 --> 01:45:48.44
General Downing came up to visit.

2484
01:45:48.44 --> 01:45:50.44
He came up on a regular basis to Harvard.

2485
01:45:50.44 --> 01:45:53.44
And so what he'd been up to, well, I did it with jury atoms.

2486
01:45:53.44 --> 01:45:56.44
Who would I think would go good?

2487
01:45:56.44 --> 01:45:58.44
You know, because there's just, you know, Joe,

2488
01:45:58.44 --> 01:46:01.44
he's one of the biggest terrorists in the world.

2489
01:46:01.44 --> 01:46:04.44
I say, well, you know, the thing about it is boss,

2490
01:46:04.44 --> 01:46:06.44
why don't you have to learn about him?

2491
01:46:06.44 --> 01:46:09.44
You know, I mean, you just can't, I'm here to learn.

2492
01:46:09.44 --> 01:46:12.44
And even if it's an unpleasant or, you hear to learn.

2493
01:46:12.44 --> 01:46:15.44
And I learned to awful lot just about maybe the couple of hours

2494
01:46:15.44 --> 01:46:19.44
that I spent there listening to that guy, just how good these folks are.

2495
01:46:19.44 --> 01:46:21.44
But tremendous education.

2496
01:46:21.44 --> 01:46:24.44
And then from there, I went to become the deputy's sock pack.

2497
01:46:24.44 --> 01:46:28.44
So I had all of these beautiful suits and overcoats and things

2498
01:46:28.44 --> 01:46:30.44
that I wore at that at Harvard.

2499
01:46:30.44 --> 01:46:33.44
And you know, on a high tire.

2500
01:46:33.44 --> 01:46:36.44
But don't throw anything away, you never know.

2501
01:46:36.44 --> 01:46:40.44
And then what you're doing the deputy, what's the deputy position

2502
01:46:40.44 --> 01:46:42.44
like out there in sock pack? What are you doing?

2503
01:46:42.44 --> 01:46:43.44
It was wonderful.

2504
01:46:43.44 --> 01:46:50.44
So in the Pacific, sock pack was co-located in the same building as the Pacific Commander.

2505
01:46:50.44 --> 01:46:55.44
So we actually were, although a separate, subunified command,

2506
01:46:55.44 --> 01:47:01.44
Admiral Prier, who was the Pacific Commander, actually made us a part of his staff.

2507
01:47:01.44 --> 01:47:06.44
So we had the best of both worlds that in the morning,

2508
01:47:06.44 --> 01:47:11.44
you know, it would be up there because the general traveled a great deal.

2509
01:47:11.44 --> 01:47:15.44
And I would be the one that represented sit there with the four star and his,

2510
01:47:15.44 --> 01:47:18.44
his staff getting the, all of the classified briefings up in the

2511
01:47:18.44 --> 01:47:26.44
shift and then down to another conference room, we're brought our audience with the less classified

2512
01:47:26.44 --> 01:47:27.44
things we discussed.

2513
01:47:27.44 --> 01:47:33.44
But going through interesting things with sending two carrier

2514
01:47:33.44 --> 01:47:38.44
bottle groups into the Taiwan street, and it's just seeing that unfold.

2515
01:47:38.44 --> 01:47:44.44
But we also had a situation where this was the first time I really became aware of

2516
01:47:44.44 --> 01:47:51.44
the headings. We had a group of Westerners. This is an August of 95.

2517
01:47:51.44 --> 01:48:00.44
On vacation through the Hindu Kush. And this was up in the line of control in Shrinagar.

2518
01:48:00.44 --> 01:48:06.44
And they were captured and held ransom by Muslims up there.

2519
01:48:06.44 --> 01:48:13.44
And one of the captures of Norwegian ran away and they caught him.

2520
01:48:13.44 --> 01:48:18.44
And they cut his head off and they put one, his body on one part of the town

2521
01:48:18.44 --> 01:48:24.44
and they head on the other part of the town with the ransom note, you know, on either.

2522
01:48:24.44 --> 01:48:30.44
And the Indian military then came to the ambassador who was the senior ranking ambassador

2523
01:48:30.44 --> 01:48:33.44
in the United States State Department then who went to the secretary.

2524
01:48:33.44 --> 01:48:40.44
And we had to deploy a Delta Force assault team there with General Pete Schumacher,

2525
01:48:40.44 --> 01:48:48.44
who was the J. Suck Commander. So we were doing not command and control for them.

2526
01:48:48.44 --> 01:48:53.44
Because the specific command was doing that. But there was nobody in the specific command

2527
01:48:53.44 --> 01:48:57.44
that understood that. So I was standing next to the Force stars.

2528
01:48:57.44 --> 01:49:00.44
Deaths, this before I am a priest showed up. This was Admiral Mackie.

2529
01:49:00.44 --> 01:49:05.44
And he had to draft a personal form message to the secretary of defense

2530
01:49:05.44 --> 01:49:11.44
and to the chairman every day. And I drafted those messages for him.

2531
01:49:11.44 --> 01:49:16.44
And, you know, he changed a little bit. But it was that time I had it marvored.

2532
01:49:16.44 --> 01:49:20.44
I mean, this is certainly, I never would have been able to do that before.

2533
01:49:20.44 --> 01:49:25.44
As I said, spelling counted. But he would change a couple of things.

2534
01:49:25.44 --> 01:49:29.44
And they would deploy there for 40 some of my days.

2535
01:49:29.44 --> 01:49:33.44
And we never got the hostages back.

2536
01:49:33.44 --> 01:49:42.44
So when just the word there, this now, it is September.

2537
01:49:42.44 --> 01:49:47.44
So it is the anniversary of the end of World War II.

2538
01:49:47.44 --> 01:49:52.44
And the president is there. The secretary of defense.

2539
01:49:52.44 --> 01:49:56.44
Everybody's there. This is Bill Clinton.

2540
01:49:56.44 --> 01:50:04.44
This is so this is 95. And now I've been locked up for 30, 40 days.

2541
01:50:04.44 --> 01:50:10.44
I'm as white as a sheet. But because I wasn't going anywhere, I'd go home for four hours

2542
01:50:10.44 --> 01:50:14.44
and sleep and shower and come back. I'm in my, you know, Aloha.

2543
01:50:14.44 --> 01:50:18.44
I'm in my flip flops. I'm in my board shorts. And I'm in my t-shirt.

2544
01:50:18.44 --> 01:50:21.44
Now, the Pacific commander is down there with the president.

2545
01:50:21.44 --> 01:50:26.44
Everybody have a breakfast, but his aide is up there. And I've got to run all of these things by him.

2546
01:50:26.44 --> 01:50:32.44
And I'm explaining, said, okay, you know, what they're asking for is they want to go forward.

2547
01:50:32.44 --> 01:50:35.44
And be to the Indians are going to do a take down.

2548
01:50:35.44 --> 01:50:38.44
And they want to have our guys to be with them during the takeout.

2549
01:50:38.44 --> 01:50:40.44
And I'm trying to explain it to him.

2550
01:50:40.44 --> 01:50:43.44
And he's in a, you know, a tack pilot.

2551
01:50:43.44 --> 01:50:48.44
And he finally, you know, keep in mind, he's in shelters with all of his medals.

2552
01:50:48.44 --> 01:50:52.44
And the big gold egg, you'll let's that the egg wear. And he finally says to me,

2553
01:50:52.44 --> 01:50:54.44
well, I can't get this. You got to come with me.

2554
01:50:54.44 --> 01:50:57.44
All right. So I'm following him. Again, flip flops.

2555
01:50:57.44 --> 01:51:01.44
I got, you know, this bag hand cuffed to my hand.

2556
01:51:01.44 --> 01:51:06.44
Right? And we jump in the car. And as I'm in the car, I'm sure I'm going to, I'm going to, you just kind of have to explain it yourself.

2557
01:51:06.44 --> 01:51:09.44
Now, I completely forgot what was going on.

2558
01:51:09.44 --> 01:51:14.44
But as I get down there, you got all the secret service agents. You got metal detectors.

2559
01:51:14.44 --> 01:51:15.44
Right?

2560
01:51:15.44 --> 01:51:20.44
And you've got two, you got an aircraft carrier, one side of the pier, and two cruises on the other.

2561
01:51:20.44 --> 01:51:25.44
Right? And they're all at dress ship and everybody standing along, man in the rail.

2562
01:51:25.44 --> 01:51:28.44
So my, my, my, my jumps out of the car.

2563
01:51:28.44 --> 01:51:31.44
And he just runs through the metal detector and they've seen him for several days.

2564
01:51:31.44 --> 01:51:34.44
And I know he's good. And I come after him.

2565
01:51:34.44 --> 01:51:37.44
And everyone's, the secret service guys at the time, I'm with him.

2566
01:51:37.44 --> 01:51:46.44
And he's with me. So walking down the pier and, uh, so, uh, with, with, with stand there and again,

2567
01:51:46.44 --> 01:51:50.44
Everybody's in dress ship. I mean, folks, you got to understand just how impressive this is.

2568
01:51:50.44 --> 01:51:54.44
You know, you've got several hundred guys in an aircraft carrier, the cruiser, you've got the flags up.

2569
01:51:54.44 --> 01:51:59.44
And then, uh, the armoured vehicle comes down initially.

2570
01:51:59.44 --> 01:52:07.44
And, uh, and these guys jump out. It's all the secret service guys. And then down comes, um, the beast.

2571
01:52:07.44 --> 01:52:13.44
So the president and the first lady or in that. And then you hear from the aircraft carrier, a bugle.

2572
01:52:13.44 --> 01:52:17.44
Everybody for attention. Right? So everybody's attention.

2573
01:52:17.44 --> 01:52:21.44
And what likes to, you know, he's saluting.

2574
01:52:21.44 --> 01:52:26.44
How many of my flip-flops and stuff? And the president gets hit the cover.

2575
01:52:26.44 --> 01:52:31.44
And I figured be an appropriate to salute. So I'm just waving.

2576
01:52:31.44 --> 01:52:36.44
And the president comes up and he shakes my head.

2577
01:52:36.44 --> 01:52:44.44
And I said thanks, Mr. President. You know? So, so, so if they go, he goes on board the ship and the meanwhile.

2578
01:52:44.44 --> 01:52:50.44
Uh, they, he went on and the rest of them had to walk down. Sorry, that comes the secretary, the Navy, the secretary,

2579
01:52:50.44 --> 01:52:59.44
the four star commander. So, what goes, okay, you got to brief the Admiral. So, we pull them off to the side and I try to give him the dispensation and what they're asking for.

2580
01:52:59.44 --> 01:53:08.44
And, um, what is your recommendation, Captain? I said, sorry. I think you need to support the guys and approve the decision.

2581
01:53:08.44 --> 01:53:15.44
Well, that's about the stupidest thing I've ever heard of, well, do I get a second guess?

2582
01:53:15.44 --> 01:53:23.44
He says, no, he said, that thing will go south. And who are they going to blame? You know? No, Joe, you go back and tell the general permission denied on undone.

2583
01:53:23.44 --> 01:53:28.44
And I get thinking retrospective about it, right, but, you know, what do you think? I guess wrong.

2584
01:53:28.44 --> 01:53:39.44
But I was an interesting job in the last thing that we did before I left is we had to evacuate Camp Odiea.

2585
01:53:39.44 --> 01:53:54.44
So, there was a coup in Cambodia and the embassy needed to be evacuated. So, we deployed to Cambodia and, um, that was the last thing I did that I finally left and then took over the center.

2586
01:53:54.44 --> 01:54:01.44
And so, you know, it was sleeping in my office, working around a clock, just an operational command, and now I take over the training command.

2587
01:54:01.44 --> 01:54:12.44
And, um, you know, I've probably been there for a month and a half, and one of your previous guests, I will build my craving, and his driving along the strand is about 7.30 at night. He's going one way and I'm on the other side.

2588
01:54:12.44 --> 01:54:19.44
He takes his Jeep and he makes a U-turn. He says, Joe, what are you doing? Come in home from work. Get the car.

2589
01:54:19.44 --> 01:54:27.44
So, get the car. Joe, it's 7.30 at night. Don't want to show duty. You drive in everybody crazy.

2590
01:54:27.44 --> 01:54:36.44
You got to take a deeper breath than maybe just kind of pace yourself a little bit more, but Joe, they can, they can, they can not keep it up this pace here. But thanks for the feedback buddy.

2591
01:54:36.44 --> 01:54:45.44
Appreciate that. You come from an operational command. We do do it like that and it takes you a while to decompress and become a human being again.

2592
01:54:45.44 --> 01:54:57.44
And how was Buds from now from the perspective, I mean, the last time you were there was as a student. Now you're back there as the as the she and your guy, you know, people talk about the changes it.

2593
01:54:57.44 --> 01:55:02.44
But yeah. And there's other people that go, hey, look, doesn't matter. There's little changes here and there, but the outcome is the same.

2594
01:55:02.44 --> 01:55:04.44
Yeah. What'd you say?

2595
01:55:04.44 --> 01:55:20.44
Yeah. I mean, it changed dramatically and that as I said, nobody really cared about the numbers back then. That if nobody graduated, nobody graduated. But at that time, we actually and appropriately so people were looking for return to the investment.

2596
01:55:20.44 --> 01:55:27.44
And, you know, we were still had a really terrible attrition rates, but we also had some other things that we did that.

2597
01:55:27.44 --> 01:55:35.44
You know, when when I finished our week, you know, I had to cut my boots up, so my feet could fit in the boot.

2598
01:55:35.44 --> 01:55:43.44
And, you know, I had saw you light us and just that said, I mean, so and that was inappropriate that, you know, we had to do that.

2599
01:55:43.44 --> 01:55:51.44
But then, you know, the young troops back then, you know, every day that they'd come in and they changed their socks out for them and give them dry socks and just some other things.

2600
01:55:51.44 --> 01:55:59.44
I mean, the mission of the command is to qualified to graduate qualified individuals to go to the seal team, not break them in bust up.

2601
01:55:59.44 --> 01:56:11.44
So, you know, whatever's going to take date to get them there, but it was really still pretty much the same, but it needed a little bit of tightening up just a little bit.

2602
01:56:11.44 --> 01:56:20.44
So, you know, we had some structures there and what I just thought we needed to do, you know, I'm not too into this as you know, Jaco, but I'd say, you know,

2603
01:56:20.44 --> 01:56:26.44
I kind of have to drive a little bit of fear into these guys, just to mean you in a little bit too relaxed.

2604
01:56:26.44 --> 01:56:39.44
So, I went to, you know, the guys at the development group and I said, can you send me a couple of wards or maybe some senior guys that would like to come on out here and help shape the community for the next couple of years.

2605
01:56:39.44 --> 01:56:49.44
So, we had some of the dev group senior list of guys come out and so one of the guys showed up a worn officer who's a dear friend of mine.

2606
01:56:49.44 --> 01:56:55.44
And we were one of the final days of hell week and the kids are in the demo pit.

2607
01:56:55.44 --> 01:57:02.44
And the kids were in the demo pit, was set in all of explosives around them and these kids are still singing now.

2608
01:57:02.44 --> 01:57:06.44
This is probably the Thursday or so I kind of forget.

2609
01:57:06.44 --> 01:57:10.44
And they've already lost about a hundred people in the class.

2610
01:57:10.44 --> 01:57:14.44
So, these kids aren't going to quit, but they are beat up.

2611
01:57:14.44 --> 01:57:19.44
And the instructors are doing their thing and I mean, he just arrived at the command.

2612
01:57:19.44 --> 01:57:23.44
I said, hey, Danny, we're down there. You want to come with me down to the demo pit and watch.

2613
01:57:23.44 --> 01:57:26.44
So, sure, it's like to come along. So, you know, I'm just doing there.

2614
01:57:26.44 --> 01:57:29.44
I got the master chief and again, I'm not into fear.

2615
01:57:29.44 --> 01:57:35.44
And I'm watching. And I look over at this guy who is a dev group worn officer.

2616
01:57:35.44 --> 01:57:37.44
And he's got tears in his eyes.

2617
01:57:37.44 --> 01:57:45.44
I didn't say anything. And the way back, he said, Danny, how'd you feel about that?

2618
01:57:45.44 --> 01:57:48.44
I forgot. He says I forgot what it was like.

2619
01:57:48.44 --> 01:57:52.44
He said, I forgot. He said, I for a little while I was there.

2620
01:57:52.44 --> 01:57:56.44
And he said, yeah, it's the same.

2621
01:57:56.44 --> 01:58:05.44
And you know, master chief DeFelsky, who was a street-street wise force master chief.

2622
01:58:05.44 --> 01:58:09.44
And he really muds sucked our instructors.

2623
01:58:09.44 --> 01:58:12.44
So, now we all go through training.

2624
01:58:12.44 --> 01:58:18.44
And as we look back on it in the review mirror, we were faster, smarter, stronger, better.

2625
01:58:18.44 --> 01:58:24.44
And so, he's the master chief and charge of all of the instructors at buds training.

2626
01:58:24.44 --> 01:58:28.44
And they're constantly complaining to the master chief about the quality of the individuals.

2627
01:58:28.44 --> 01:58:31.44
They're not making this enough. They don't do this. They should be able to continue.

2628
01:58:31.44 --> 01:58:35.44
So, to Felsky, really smart guy.

2629
01:58:35.44 --> 01:58:39.44
On a Friday afternoon, we have one big classroom.

2630
01:58:39.44 --> 01:58:42.44
It probably seats about 100.

2631
01:58:42.44 --> 01:58:45.44
So, he's got all the new instructors in there.

2632
01:58:45.44 --> 01:58:47.44
Everybody come, who's mandatory.

2633
01:58:47.44 --> 01:58:50.44
And he's got the truck board up there.

2634
01:58:50.44 --> 01:58:52.44
It's said, all right, first phase.

2635
01:58:52.44 --> 01:58:55.44
What is the minimum standard to do need to have for the fore,

2636
01:58:55.44 --> 01:58:57.44
to have for the fore mile run?

2637
01:58:57.44 --> 01:58:58.44
And it went down for it.

2638
01:58:58.44 --> 01:59:01.44
And the O course did, and a second phase third phase.

2639
01:59:01.44 --> 01:59:03.44
And everyone wants everything to be, you've got to do better.

2640
01:59:03.44 --> 01:59:05.44
You've got to be faster, got to be stronger.

2641
01:59:05.44 --> 01:59:07.44
So, he really muds sucked them.

2642
01:59:07.44 --> 01:59:09.44
So, he said, let me understand this now.

2643
01:59:09.44 --> 01:59:11.44
He said, Chris, I'm going to go talk to the captain.

2644
01:59:11.44 --> 01:59:12.44
And we're going to change things here.

2645
01:59:12.44 --> 01:59:14.44
He says, so, but I want to make sure that everybody agrees.

2646
01:59:14.44 --> 01:59:17.44
If you can't do this in first phase, if you can't do that,

2647
01:59:17.44 --> 01:59:18.44
it's second phase.

2648
01:59:18.44 --> 01:59:20.44
If you can't do that in third phase, you should never be a seal.

2649
01:59:20.44 --> 01:59:21.44
Is that correct?

2650
01:59:21.44 --> 01:59:22.44
That's right, Master Chief.

2651
01:59:22.44 --> 01:59:23.44
And right.

2652
01:59:23.44 --> 01:59:24.44
Well, gentlemen, it just happens.

2653
01:59:24.44 --> 01:59:26.44
I have every one of you training records here.

2654
01:59:26.44 --> 01:59:29.44
And what I'm going to do is I'm going to give each and every one of you

2655
01:59:29.44 --> 01:59:30.44
your training record.

2656
01:59:30.44 --> 01:59:32.44
I'm going to walk out of the room.

2657
01:59:32.44 --> 01:59:36.44
Once you finish looking at it, and you see what you did,

2658
01:59:36.44 --> 01:59:40.44
just put it back in the box, and I'll see you Monday.

2659
01:59:40.44 --> 01:59:42.44
Well, because it was true.

2660
01:59:42.44 --> 01:59:44.44
It's humbling to go back and look at your own record,

2661
01:59:44.44 --> 01:59:46.44
and see what the instructor said about you.

2662
01:59:46.44 --> 01:59:47.44
You know, okay, it's all that.

2663
01:59:47.44 --> 01:59:48.44
We still have the same.

2664
01:59:48.44 --> 01:59:54.44
We've got the, we've got every single record from day one.

2665
01:59:54.44 --> 01:59:57.44
And so, as a matter of fact, when I was there,

2666
01:59:57.44 --> 02:00:00.44
I tried to burn down the room there that I might not go to the table.

2667
02:00:00.44 --> 02:00:02.44
And I can't pass it on.

2668
02:00:02.44 --> 02:00:05.44
And when did you leave Buds?

2669
02:00:05.44 --> 02:00:06.44
What's that?

2670
02:00:06.44 --> 02:00:09.44
When did you win when you've done it, Buds as the commander?

2671
02:00:09.44 --> 02:00:12.44
Well, I was, I was very, for 39 months,

2672
02:00:12.44 --> 02:00:14.44
which is a really good, you know,

2673
02:00:14.44 --> 02:00:19.44
and honestly, it was just a fantastic tour,

2674
02:00:19.44 --> 02:00:22.44
not one that I wanted to do, because I was going to go someplace else

2675
02:00:22.44 --> 02:00:24.44
in Virginia Beach.

2676
02:00:24.44 --> 02:00:28.44
And we had trouble with our attrition rate and getting folks through.

2677
02:00:28.44 --> 02:00:33.44
So I got changed from going out to Virginia Beach to the center,

2678
02:00:33.44 --> 02:00:37.44
but it turned out to be probably the most rewarding tour I ever had.

2679
02:00:37.44 --> 02:00:40.44
To have people like Marcus the Trail go through training.

2680
02:00:40.44 --> 02:00:43.44
And, you know, remember, Marcus,

2681
02:00:43.44 --> 02:00:49.44
because not many students break their femur in training.

2682
02:00:49.44 --> 02:00:52.44
And so, you know, not a good time when, you know,

2683
02:00:52.44 --> 02:00:57.44
the senior instructors and the doctor and the master chief come to talk to you about.

2684
02:00:57.44 --> 02:00:59.44
All right.

2685
02:00:59.44 --> 02:01:01.44
He broke his, what?

2686
02:01:01.44 --> 02:01:03.44
He broke his femur.

2687
02:01:03.44 --> 02:01:04.44
How?

2688
02:01:04.44 --> 02:01:05.44
Stress fracture.

2689
02:01:05.44 --> 02:01:08.44
Well, BS, right?

2690
02:01:08.44 --> 02:01:11.44
So, I mean, we went through what I'm going through this stuff.

2691
02:01:11.44 --> 02:01:14.44
So what happened was, I mean,

2692
02:01:14.44 --> 02:01:16.44
I mean, and then we're covering for him,

2693
02:01:16.44 --> 02:01:18.44
and he did break his femur.

2694
02:01:18.44 --> 02:01:19.44
Yeah.

2695
02:01:19.44 --> 02:01:22.44
And then, Marcus, if you listen to that, you know.

2696
02:01:22.44 --> 02:01:24.44
So, to be instructors, you know,

2697
02:01:24.44 --> 02:01:27.44
and if any of you think that you could beat me,

2698
02:01:27.44 --> 02:01:29.44
of course, Marcus raises his head.

2699
02:01:29.44 --> 02:01:31.44
But I'll beat this is the obstacle course.

2700
02:01:31.44 --> 02:01:34.44
So, we have, it's all technique.

2701
02:01:34.44 --> 02:01:39.44
And now you're dealing with a seal that's been doing this obstacle course for years.

2702
02:01:39.44 --> 02:01:42.44
And, you know, now Marcus was good,

2703
02:01:42.44 --> 02:01:45.44
but you've got a guy who, you know, these guys look like Pixies going over this darn thing.

2704
02:01:45.44 --> 02:01:48.44
So, you're climbed to the top of the cargo net.

2705
02:01:48.44 --> 02:01:50.44
Was that about 30 feet, Chocos?

2706
02:01:50.44 --> 02:01:51.44
Yeah, right?

2707
02:01:51.44 --> 02:01:53.44
And you throw yourself over.

2708
02:01:53.44 --> 02:01:56.44
And, but you do it in a technique that then you drop down a little bit,

2709
02:01:56.44 --> 02:01:59.44
and you can grab onto the rope and work the way down.

2710
02:01:59.44 --> 02:02:02.44
So, Marcus got there, and he knows this technique,

2711
02:02:02.44 --> 02:02:04.44
and he threw himself over.

2712
02:02:04.44 --> 02:02:08.44
The only problem was he didn't grab it.

2713
02:02:08.44 --> 02:02:11.44
And he went down the 30 feet and hit,

2714
02:02:11.44 --> 02:02:13.44
and he broke his femur.

2715
02:02:13.44 --> 02:02:17.44
So, I made to his credit, though, went out, got roll back,

2716
02:02:17.44 --> 02:02:20.44
and came back, but you mean that's good old boy there.

2717
02:02:20.44 --> 02:02:22.44
But they lied to me.

2718
02:02:22.44 --> 02:02:26.44
And he could teammates should do because, you know,

2719
02:02:26.44 --> 02:02:28.44
because they knew what the instructor was controlling.

2720
02:02:28.44 --> 02:02:30.44
And I bought it.

2721
02:02:30.44 --> 02:02:34.44
Unfortunately, it wasn't until later on that actually Marcus told me the story that I brought my life,

2722
02:02:34.44 --> 02:02:37.44
Joe, but he's the one that came clean.

2723
02:02:37.44 --> 02:02:45.44
Yeah, it must be like the glimpse that you get at human psychology when you're,

2724
02:02:45.44 --> 02:02:47.44
because I never worked at butts, you know,

2725
02:02:47.44 --> 02:02:49.44
I went through it, but I never saw from the other side.

2726
02:02:49.44 --> 02:02:53.44
The glimpse at human psychology of what people are capable of and what breaks them,

2727
02:02:53.44 --> 02:02:56.44
and that's got to be a, that's got to leave him, Marcus.

2728
02:02:56.44 --> 02:02:58.44
Well, absolutely.

2729
02:02:58.44 --> 02:03:00.44
And, you know, you literally learn a lot.

2730
02:03:00.44 --> 02:03:03.44
I mean, no, you know, you and I go through it,

2731
02:03:03.44 --> 02:03:04.44
but you go through it as different.

2732
02:03:04.44 --> 02:03:05.44
You're experiencing it.

2733
02:03:05.44 --> 02:03:07.44
When you have an opportunity to watch class,

2734
02:03:07.44 --> 02:03:09.44
after class, after class, you know,

2735
02:03:09.44 --> 02:03:13.44
I just remember, you know, the, my first hell week class.

2736
02:03:13.44 --> 02:03:16.44
And this is Monday night of hell week.

2737
02:03:16.44 --> 02:03:18.44
So they started off at Sunday.

2738
02:03:18.44 --> 02:03:20.44
They've been out of for about, you know, 22 hours, 23 hours,

2739
02:03:20.44 --> 02:03:22.44
they're having their evening meal.

2740
02:03:22.44 --> 02:03:25.44
And the class, you know, outside.

2741
02:03:25.44 --> 02:03:28.44
And there's a couple of students staying behind in the childhood,

2742
02:03:28.44 --> 02:03:31.44
putting the chairs back into the table.

2743
02:03:31.44 --> 02:03:34.44
Now, I thought that this was somewhat odd.

2744
02:03:34.44 --> 02:03:38.44
So I'm sitting there with the instructors having dinner.

2745
02:03:38.44 --> 02:03:40.44
I said, so what are these guys up to?

2746
02:03:40.44 --> 02:03:43.44
Yeah, they just wait for the rest of the class to leave so they can quit.

2747
02:03:43.44 --> 02:03:46.44
And it was true.

2748
02:03:46.44 --> 02:03:49.44
So you can just, but what it was is,

2749
02:03:49.44 --> 02:03:53.44
nobody ever quit in the evolution.

2750
02:03:53.44 --> 02:03:58.44
Everybody quit before the evolution in anticipation

2751
02:03:58.44 --> 02:04:01.44
of what was going to happen.

2752
02:04:01.44 --> 02:04:10.44
And just, now, you can argue whether or not it is the most demanding physical course in the military.

2753
02:04:10.44 --> 02:04:12.44
If it's not, it's close.

2754
02:04:12.44 --> 02:04:14.44
So, well, it's not getting anybody.

2755
02:04:14.44 --> 02:04:19.44
But I will tell you this, it is a far more psychological program

2756
02:04:19.44 --> 02:04:22.44
than it is a physical program.

2757
02:04:22.44 --> 02:04:26.44
Because it's designed to keep you off foot

2758
02:04:26.44 --> 02:04:31.44
and the standards are raised and raised or the,

2759
02:04:31.44 --> 02:04:34.44
you're told that this is going to be the evolution today,

2760
02:04:34.44 --> 02:04:36.44
and then they change it.

2761
02:04:36.44 --> 02:04:39.44
But specifically, that can you adjust to that?

2762
02:04:39.44 --> 02:04:41.44
Can you adjust to that?

2763
02:04:41.44 --> 02:04:46.44
So it really is most of the people who quit.

2764
02:04:46.44 --> 02:04:51.44
No, I had a three and a half hour briefing today,

2765
02:04:51.44 --> 02:04:52.44
down there with our teammates.

2766
02:04:52.44 --> 02:04:54.44
An update on what the committee's up to.

2767
02:04:54.44 --> 02:04:57.44
And beef trashler gave me the pitch.

2768
02:04:57.44 --> 02:05:01.44
And beef just took over the center on Friday.

2769
02:05:01.44 --> 02:05:08.44
And they bring in close to 900 students a year

2770
02:05:08.44 --> 02:05:11.44
to get 180 out.

2771
02:05:11.44 --> 02:05:14.44
187 is his demand signal.

2772
02:05:14.44 --> 02:05:15.44
And 900.

2773
02:05:15.44 --> 02:05:18.44
So it's still in spite of everything that we've done.

2774
02:05:18.44 --> 02:05:20.44
In preparation, it's just, you know,

2775
02:05:20.44 --> 02:05:21.44
when you went through nobody knew,

2776
02:05:21.44 --> 02:05:24.44
when I went through, it was a trivial pursuit question.

2777
02:05:24.44 --> 02:05:25.44
You know?

2778
02:05:25.44 --> 02:05:27.44
But these guys are prepared.

2779
02:05:27.44 --> 02:05:28.44
They know what it's doing.

2780
02:05:28.44 --> 02:05:30.44
And they all, I said to them today,

2781
02:05:30.44 --> 02:05:31.44
what is it?

2782
02:05:31.44 --> 02:05:33.44
They self-select.

2783
02:05:33.44 --> 02:05:35.44
They raised their hand.

2784
02:05:35.44 --> 02:05:38.44
And they, they, we lose a couple from academics.

2785
02:05:38.44 --> 02:05:40.44
We lose some from pool comp.

2786
02:05:40.44 --> 02:05:43.44
But the vast majority of it, this is not for me.

2787
02:05:43.44 --> 02:05:45.44
And when I used to get the young men in the,

2788
02:05:45.44 --> 02:05:47.44
you know, now I was not an instructor.

2789
02:05:47.44 --> 02:05:50.44
And I would get them all after the instructor.

2790
02:05:50.44 --> 02:05:53.44
After the instructor's talking about how weak I'd go in there.

2791
02:05:53.44 --> 02:05:55.44
And I would just talk to these guys.

2792
02:05:55.44 --> 02:05:58.44
And Marcus talks about that in his book.

2793
02:05:58.44 --> 02:06:01.44
I just look, it's as simple as this guys.

2794
02:06:01.44 --> 02:06:03.44
You know, everyone of you guys can make it through.

2795
02:06:03.44 --> 02:06:04.44
Otherwise you wouldn't be here.

2796
02:06:04.44 --> 02:06:06.44
I mean, you're already been here now for several weeks.

2797
02:06:06.44 --> 02:06:10.44
If you're not going to make it, you're the one who decides you're not going to make it.

2798
02:06:10.44 --> 02:06:12.44
It's not going to be us at all.

2799
02:06:12.44 --> 02:06:15.44
And you know, it's as simple as this guys.

2800
02:06:15.44 --> 02:06:19.44
I mean, this is certainly the secret to life is just don't quit.

2801
02:06:19.44 --> 02:06:21.44
Just don't quit.

2802
02:06:21.44 --> 02:06:24.44
I said, and don't doubt yourself.

2803
02:06:24.44 --> 02:06:28.44
And, you know, these guys, they doubt themselves,

2804
02:06:28.44 --> 02:06:30.44
but it's why am I here?

2805
02:06:30.44 --> 02:06:32.44
And I used to say that when they first came,

2806
02:06:32.44 --> 02:06:34.44
what you, you know,

2807
02:06:34.44 --> 02:06:36.44
Buds is not the seal team.

2808
02:06:36.44 --> 02:06:38.44
Buds is Buds.

2809
02:06:38.44 --> 02:06:43.44
It is where you need to spend 26 weeks to get where you want to go.

2810
02:06:43.44 --> 02:06:48.44
But don't even think for a second that this is the seal team.

2811
02:06:48.44 --> 02:06:52.44
But I will tell you this, you put up with this for 26 weeks.

2812
02:06:52.44 --> 02:06:54.44
And you get to that seal team.

2813
02:06:54.44 --> 02:06:57.44
It will make everything that you did here worthwhile.

2814
02:06:57.44 --> 02:06:59.44
Trust me.

2815
02:06:59.44 --> 02:07:02.44
I was down there a little while ago, and, you know,

2816
02:07:02.44 --> 02:07:04.44
I was walking around and there was,

2817
02:07:04.44 --> 02:07:06.44
this was one of my friends that works there.

2818
02:07:06.44 --> 02:07:08.44
And there's a hundred helmets by the bell.

2819
02:07:08.44 --> 02:07:10.44
A hundred helmets by the bell.

2820
02:07:10.44 --> 02:07:13.44
And he says, you know what?

2821
02:07:13.44 --> 02:07:15.44
I said, I said, that's a lot of quitters.

2822
02:07:15.44 --> 02:07:19.44
And he says, you know what?

2823
02:07:19.44 --> 02:07:22.44
Everyone of those guys is a stunt.

2824
02:07:22.44 --> 02:07:23.44
A stunt.

2825
02:07:23.44 --> 02:07:24.44
A stunt.

2826
02:07:24.44 --> 02:07:28.44
And he's basically referencing compared to us when we went through.

2827
02:07:28.44 --> 02:07:29.44
You know, when I went through,

2828
02:07:29.44 --> 02:07:34.44
I thought if you did a pull-up workout where you did 30 or 40 pull-ups

2829
02:07:34.44 --> 02:07:35.44
that that was a pretty good workout.

2830
02:07:35.44 --> 02:07:37.44
And you don't realize when you get to Buds,

2831
02:07:37.44 --> 02:07:39.44
you're going to do 300 or 400 or 500 or 500.

2832
02:07:39.44 --> 02:07:41.44
You just didn't know we didn't know back then.

2833
02:07:41.44 --> 02:07:43.44
But every one of these kids now,

2834
02:07:43.44 --> 02:07:46.44
their studs, physical studs.

2835
02:07:46.44 --> 02:07:47.44
But they still quit.

2836
02:07:47.44 --> 02:07:48.44
Oh yeah?

2837
02:07:48.44 --> 02:07:49.44
Yeah.

2838
02:07:49.44 --> 02:07:52.44
But the difference though physically, I would say,

2839
02:07:52.44 --> 02:07:55.44
is when I went through Eric Olson,

2840
02:07:55.44 --> 02:07:58.44
Bill McCraven was too close as behind me.

2841
02:07:58.44 --> 02:08:00.44
The way Eric put it, and I think this is right.

2842
02:08:00.44 --> 02:08:04.44
Back then, it depends on your parents' work

2843
02:08:04.44 --> 02:08:06.44
if you're going to make it too much.

2844
02:08:06.44 --> 02:08:07.44
Because it was endurance.

2845
02:08:07.44 --> 02:08:09.44
Everybody had to run forever,

2846
02:08:09.44 --> 02:08:11.44
and everybody had to swim forever back then.

2847
02:08:11.44 --> 02:08:13.44
So it was a different type of body type.

2848
02:08:13.44 --> 02:08:15.44
Now, not everybody looks like you, John.

2849
02:08:15.44 --> 02:08:17.44
But, but, yes, you know,

2850
02:08:17.44 --> 02:08:20.44
when I took over the center,

2851
02:08:20.44 --> 02:08:22.44
and these young men lined up next to the pool

2852
02:08:22.44 --> 02:08:23.44
and just there at this swimsuits,

2853
02:08:23.44 --> 02:08:27.44
it was a completely different physique on those young men.

2854
02:08:27.44 --> 02:08:29.44
But we were prepared for different things,

2855
02:08:29.44 --> 02:08:32.44
as opposed to no long-range patrols.

2856
02:08:32.44 --> 02:08:35.44
No 10-12 days in the field.

2857
02:08:35.44 --> 02:08:36.44
No 13-hour swims.

2858
02:08:36.44 --> 02:08:38.44
You're going to go to the Hindu Kush.

2859
02:08:38.44 --> 02:08:40.44
And you're going to go to Balad.

2860
02:08:40.44 --> 02:08:41.44
You're going to go to Malad.

2861
02:08:41.44 --> 02:08:42.44
You're going to go to Follusia.

2862
02:08:42.44 --> 02:08:44.44
And you've got to wear heavy equipment.

2863
02:08:44.44 --> 02:08:45.44
And you've got to carry a lot of stuff.

2864
02:08:45.44 --> 02:08:46.44
So it changed.

2865
02:08:46.44 --> 02:08:48.44
And I don't know what's going to happen now.

2866
02:08:48.44 --> 02:08:50.44
That we're changing.

2867
02:08:50.44 --> 02:08:52.44
And Edmel Howard, rightfully so,

2868
02:08:52.44 --> 02:08:55.44
is going back into the strategic competition.

2869
02:08:55.44 --> 02:08:56.44
Great power competition.

2870
02:08:56.44 --> 02:08:59.44
And put the community back into a maritime focus.

2871
02:08:59.44 --> 02:09:01.44
Get those wetsuits ready, boys.

2872
02:09:01.44 --> 02:09:04.44
That was a loop.

2873
02:09:04.44 --> 02:09:07.44
Did you, you know, it's interesting.

2874
02:09:07.44 --> 02:09:09.44
You know, people always ask who's going to make it through.

2875
02:09:09.44 --> 02:09:12.44
And I would never put a bet on anybody.

2876
02:09:12.44 --> 02:09:13.44
One way or the other.

2877
02:09:13.44 --> 02:09:15.44
Who's going to make it through?

2878
02:09:15.44 --> 02:09:16.44
I don't care where they came from.

2879
02:09:16.44 --> 02:09:18.44
What their background was.

2880
02:09:18.44 --> 02:09:21.44
I remember one of one of my commanding officers,

2881
02:09:21.44 --> 02:09:23.44
a capitol comel.

2882
02:09:23.44 --> 02:09:26.44
He told the story to me.

2883
02:09:26.44 --> 02:09:27.44
And I never forgot it.

2884
02:09:27.44 --> 02:09:29.44
He had, there was some officer that was putting

2885
02:09:29.44 --> 02:09:30.44
in a package to go to Buds.

2886
02:09:30.44 --> 02:09:32.44
And he said, I've never backed anyone before.

2887
02:09:32.44 --> 02:09:34.44
I've never, I've never backed anyone.

2888
02:09:34.44 --> 02:09:35.44
I've never said this guy's going to make it.

2889
02:09:35.44 --> 02:09:37.44
And this guy had this pristine record.

2890
02:09:37.44 --> 02:09:39.44
He was an athlete.

2891
02:09:39.44 --> 02:09:40.44
This. He was captain of that.

2892
02:09:40.44 --> 02:09:41.44
He was all these things.

2893
02:09:41.44 --> 02:09:42.44
He spoke to languages.

2894
02:09:42.44 --> 02:09:44.44
Maybe even three languages.

2895
02:09:44.44 --> 02:09:46.44
Just a complete sudden, finally,

2896
02:09:46.44 --> 02:09:47.44
Oh, Colonel, you know, signs office packages.

2897
02:09:47.44 --> 02:09:49.44
He says, yeah, take this guy to Buds.

2898
02:09:49.44 --> 02:09:51.44
And the freaking guy quit on him.

2899
02:09:51.44 --> 02:09:53.44
And he said, I will never ever,

2900
02:09:53.44 --> 02:09:55.44
Spacety buddy again.

2901
02:09:55.44 --> 02:09:59.44
And to me, that was a captain that had been in the teams forever.

2902
02:09:59.44 --> 02:10:01.44
And denied all these packages.

2903
02:10:01.44 --> 02:10:03.44
And even with that level of discretion,

2904
02:10:03.44 --> 02:10:04.44
you can't tell who's going to make it.

2905
02:10:04.44 --> 02:10:05.44
And who's not going to make it.

2906
02:10:05.44 --> 02:10:07.44
There's Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim.

2907
02:10:07.44 --> 02:10:09.44
Yeah.

2908
02:10:09.44 --> 02:10:11.44
Yeah. No, no, you really can't.

2909
02:10:11.44 --> 02:10:15.44
And because you really don't know what's going on behind the eyes.

2910
02:10:15.44 --> 02:10:20.44
So we've got members who are on the national teams,

2911
02:10:20.44 --> 02:10:22.44
whether it's the nationalist for me team,

2912
02:10:22.44 --> 02:10:25.44
actually, they're these very accomplished people.

2913
02:10:25.44 --> 02:10:26.44
Division one athletes.

2914
02:10:26.44 --> 02:10:28.44
And but the other thing as well,

2915
02:10:28.44 --> 02:10:30.44
you get some kid that comes out of high school,

2916
02:10:30.44 --> 02:10:31.44
goes to boot camp,

2917
02:10:31.44 --> 02:10:35.44
and interview sports, and he's standing tall on graduation day.

2918
02:10:35.44 --> 02:10:37.44
Yeah. That's me.

2919
02:10:37.44 --> 02:10:39.44
August for that.

2920
02:10:39.44 --> 02:10:44.44
August for that. I had an Olympic alternate gymnast in my Buds class,

2921
02:10:44.44 --> 02:10:45.44
quit.

2922
02:10:45.44 --> 02:10:51.44
And I had the NCAA Water Polo team captain in my class.

2923
02:10:51.44 --> 02:10:52.44
Quit.

2924
02:10:52.44 --> 02:10:53.44
Yeah.

2925
02:10:53.44 --> 02:10:56.44
And like I was that guy that I was an average,

2926
02:10:56.44 --> 02:10:58.44
if not slightly below average athlete,

2927
02:10:58.44 --> 02:11:01.44
nice going, hey, stock it out. They weren't going to make me quit.

2928
02:11:01.44 --> 02:11:02.44
That's the way it is.

2929
02:11:02.44 --> 02:11:03.44
Yeah.

2930
02:11:03.44 --> 02:11:07.44
Where were you when September 11th happened?

2931
02:11:07.44 --> 02:11:11.44
I always signed the United States Special Operations Command.

2932
02:11:11.44 --> 02:11:14.44
And excuse me.

2933
02:11:14.44 --> 02:11:17.44
I was a signed the United States Special Operations Command.

2934
02:11:17.44 --> 02:11:19.44
And you know, we talked a little bit earlier,

2935
02:11:19.44 --> 02:11:23.44
Chaco about the community and what,

2936
02:11:23.44 --> 02:11:25.44
the fleet commander said,

2937
02:11:25.44 --> 02:11:28.44
what my father said, and here I am,

2938
02:11:28.44 --> 02:11:33.44
I got promoted to one star at the end of August of 2001.

2939
02:11:33.44 --> 02:11:34.44
Wow.

2940
02:11:34.44 --> 02:11:36.44
And a little more than three weeks later,

2941
02:11:36.44 --> 02:11:39.44
I'm sitting in my office in the United States Special Operations Command.

2942
02:11:39.44 --> 02:11:44.44
And you know, one of the troops comes and he leans against the

2943
02:11:44.44 --> 02:11:46.44
the Deutsche and said, well,

2944
02:11:46.44 --> 02:11:49.44
it's up. He said, a plane just hit the twin tower.

2945
02:11:49.44 --> 02:11:52.44
So, you know, being a New Yorker.

2946
02:11:52.44 --> 02:11:53.44
Yeah.

2947
02:11:53.44 --> 02:11:56.44
I think it's okay. You know, this is foggy day and you got a small

2948
02:11:56.44 --> 02:11:57.44
aircraft there.

2949
02:11:57.44 --> 02:11:59.44
And he's not leaving.

2950
02:11:59.44 --> 02:12:00.44
Yeah.

2951
02:12:00.44 --> 02:12:02.44
And just again, okay, I got a TV.

2952
02:12:02.44 --> 02:12:04.44
I said, do you want to turn a TV on?

2953
02:12:04.44 --> 02:12:06.44
That's what I like to say.

2954
02:12:06.44 --> 02:12:08.44
So, I'm behind the desk.

2955
02:12:08.44 --> 02:12:09.44
I got the TV over there.

2956
02:12:09.44 --> 02:12:11.44
And I look up, I go.

2957
02:12:11.44 --> 02:12:15.44
It is a perfectly beautiful day in New York.

2958
02:12:15.44 --> 02:12:17.44
And I mean, shortly after that,

2959
02:12:17.44 --> 02:12:19.44
I mean, with moments,

2960
02:12:19.44 --> 02:12:22.44
I see the other plane flying south on the Hudson River.

2961
02:12:22.44 --> 02:12:24.44
You don't fly south on the Hudson River.

2962
02:12:24.44 --> 02:12:26.44
The planes go in it to Newark.

2963
02:12:26.44 --> 02:12:28.44
You got a flying north where you got to go around.

2964
02:12:28.44 --> 02:12:30.44
And I'm thinking, what an idiot.

2965
02:12:30.44 --> 02:12:33.44
That guy's flying that plane around just to get a better look at that.

2966
02:12:33.44 --> 02:12:34.44
How stupid.

2967
02:12:34.44 --> 02:12:35.44
And then boom.

2968
02:12:35.44 --> 02:12:37.44
He goes into the second tower.

2969
02:12:37.44 --> 02:12:40.44
And I made it immediately.

2970
02:12:40.44 --> 02:12:41.44
And I get up.

2971
02:12:41.44 --> 02:12:45.44
And I ran into the Socom Commanders office.

2972
02:12:45.44 --> 02:12:48.44
General Holland.

2973
02:12:48.44 --> 02:12:50.44
And I said, General,

2974
02:12:50.44 --> 02:12:52.44
We're under attack.

2975
02:12:52.44 --> 02:12:53.44
We're at war.

2976
02:12:53.44 --> 02:12:55.44
So what are you talking about, Joe?

2977
02:12:55.44 --> 02:12:56.44
I said turn the TV on.

2978
02:12:56.44 --> 02:12:58.44
So we're at war.

2979
02:12:58.44 --> 02:13:03.44
And so obviously, that was a long day to kind of sort everything out.

2980
02:13:03.44 --> 02:13:09.44
And I finally got home about maybe one o'clock on the morning,

2981
02:13:09.44 --> 02:13:13.44
two o'clock in the morning of the 12th.

2982
02:13:13.44 --> 02:13:16.44
And so I'm just having a little bit of orange juice

2983
02:13:16.44 --> 02:13:18.44
and maybe an English month or something.

2984
02:13:18.44 --> 02:13:21.44
And I get a couple of hours before I got to go back and work and the phone rings.

2985
02:13:21.44 --> 02:13:23.44
And I pick up the phone.

2986
02:13:23.44 --> 02:13:25.44
I figured it was the headquarters.

2987
02:13:25.44 --> 02:13:28.44
And there's the shrill voice on the other side.

2988
02:13:28.44 --> 02:13:30.44
It's just kind of screaming.

2989
02:13:30.44 --> 02:13:33.44
And obviously, it's my brother.

2990
02:13:33.44 --> 02:13:36.44
And my brother was at 220 church street,

2991
02:13:36.44 --> 02:13:39.44
which is a block down from the Twin Towers.

2992
02:13:39.44 --> 02:13:41.44
And he was at a meeting.

2993
02:13:41.44 --> 02:13:45.44
And so the first bill he didn't see the plane hit,

2994
02:13:45.44 --> 02:13:47.44
but he saw the building on fire.

2995
02:13:47.44 --> 02:13:49.44
I said, well, maybe we should adjourn.

2996
02:13:49.44 --> 02:13:52.44
I mean, nobody could believe that it was happening.

2997
02:13:52.44 --> 02:13:55.44
And you said, so by the time the adjourn,

2998
02:13:55.44 --> 02:14:00.44
he went out to the street, he actually viewed the people jumping

2999
02:14:00.44 --> 02:14:04.44
for their lives out of the Twin Towers, which is pretty traumatic.

3000
02:14:04.44 --> 02:14:09.44
But then he had to walk home across the Brooklyn Bridge all

3001
02:14:09.44 --> 02:14:11.44
of the way to his home, which probably wound up being,

3002
02:14:11.44 --> 02:14:14.44
well, I don't know, maybe about 12 to 15 miles.

3003
02:14:14.44 --> 02:14:17.44
Because there was no transportation, everything shut down.

3004
02:14:17.44 --> 02:14:20.44
So by the time he got home, that's when he calls me.

3005
02:14:20.44 --> 02:14:24.44
And it kind of broke down to Joseph Gettham.

3006
02:14:24.44 --> 02:14:25.44
I know what you do.

3007
02:14:25.44 --> 02:14:27.44
It's up to you guys, get them.

3008
02:14:27.44 --> 02:14:28.44
I think I don't know.

3009
02:14:28.44 --> 02:14:30.44
Just try to calm them down.

3010
02:14:30.44 --> 02:14:33.44
Because it's okay, Bob, I'll do my best.

3011
02:14:33.44 --> 02:14:34.44
You know.

3012
02:14:34.44 --> 02:14:39.44
And so, I never thought I'd be an apple, never.

3013
02:14:39.44 --> 02:14:42.44
And I certainly never thought I'd be an apple.

3014
02:14:42.44 --> 02:14:44.44
When I nation was at war.

3015
02:14:44.44 --> 02:14:49.44
And to have that opportunity to actually be a flag

3016
02:14:49.44 --> 02:14:52.44
on general officer serving in the United States military

3017
02:14:52.44 --> 02:14:56.44
when the nation is engaged in decisive combat operations

3018
02:14:56.44 --> 02:15:00.44
who is quite an honor, but also as you know,

3019
02:15:00.44 --> 02:15:02.44
Chaco, quite a challenge.

3020
02:15:02.44 --> 02:15:07.44
And we took us a while, but we finally did it.

3021
02:15:07.44 --> 02:15:12.44
And after it, and a 22,000, 11, I call my brother.

3022
02:15:12.44 --> 02:15:16.44
And it took a while, Bob, but we got him.

3023
02:15:16.44 --> 02:15:19.44
And I'll tell you what, when that happened,

3024
02:15:19.44 --> 02:15:23.44
I know I retired in July of 2010.

3025
02:15:23.44 --> 02:15:26.44
And I'm up early in the morning.

3026
02:15:26.44 --> 02:15:29.44
Not as early as you, but probably about 530.

3027
02:15:29.44 --> 02:15:32.44
And I'm in the kitchen.

3028
02:15:32.44 --> 02:15:34.44
And you know, got a little bit of a cup of coffee

3029
02:15:34.44 --> 02:15:37.44
and putting my own issues on.

3030
02:15:37.44 --> 02:15:41.44
And I thought I heard something on the radio about the lawn.

3031
02:15:41.44 --> 02:15:44.44
I mean, I just wasn't paying attention.

3032
02:15:44.44 --> 02:15:45.44
That doesn't.

3033
02:15:45.44 --> 02:15:50.44
So I just waited until six o'clock to hear the news.

3034
02:15:50.44 --> 02:15:54.44
And folks who stayed up late the night before they knew.

3035
02:15:54.44 --> 02:15:56.44
And I still had no idea.

3036
02:15:56.44 --> 02:15:59.44
And I heard what had happened.

3037
02:15:59.44 --> 02:16:03.44
And I just think, I mean,

3038
02:16:03.44 --> 02:16:05.44
I just sat down there.

3039
02:16:05.44 --> 02:16:06.44
I couldn't go for a run.

3040
02:16:06.44 --> 02:16:09.44
I mean, I just had tears in my eyes.

3041
02:16:09.44 --> 02:16:13.44
And that I know full well and so to you.

3042
02:16:13.44 --> 02:16:19.44
The heavy road, the toll that was paid to get to a bottom-up.

3043
02:16:19.44 --> 02:16:23.44
All of the blood and all the lives and all the brave men and women,

3044
02:16:23.44 --> 02:16:25.44
you know, who got there.

3045
02:16:25.44 --> 02:16:27.44
And so, you know, about the time I got to work,

3046
02:16:27.44 --> 02:16:29.44
you know, everybody's Jubilon.

3047
02:16:29.44 --> 02:16:32.44
And I said, you know,

3048
02:16:32.44 --> 02:16:36.44
I had quiet pride because it was our teammates.

3049
02:16:36.44 --> 02:16:38.44
And then the one sick teeth and the CIA.

3050
02:16:38.44 --> 02:16:43.44
But it was really emotional for me just thinking about whether it be

3051
02:16:43.44 --> 02:16:48.44
Mad Axelson, Danny Deeds or all of the other folks that, you know,

3052
02:16:48.44 --> 02:16:54.44
Wujwa, all the men that we lost there in Afghanistan.

3053
02:16:54.44 --> 02:16:59.44
And so, yeah, that was, you know, people

3054
02:16:59.44 --> 02:17:02.44
be getting my haircut and how long you've been to the Navy.

3055
02:17:02.44 --> 02:17:05.44
Thirty-six years, well, I'll just stay still long.

3056
02:17:05.44 --> 02:17:08.44
Well, you know, we've been at war for the last ten years, buddy.

3057
02:17:08.44 --> 02:17:10.44
And it was on our shoulders.

3058
02:17:10.44 --> 02:17:14.44
But, you know, when you know, you know, you know,

3059
02:17:14.44 --> 02:17:16.44
you know, no full well, this war,

3060
02:17:16.44 --> 02:17:19.44
it was personal to you and me and to many of us.

3061
02:17:19.44 --> 02:17:23.44
And the other thing as well, it's just hard to explain to people

3062
02:17:23.44 --> 02:17:26.44
how you can become friends through death.

3063
02:17:26.44 --> 02:17:31.44
That you meet parents and you meet family members that you never knew.

3064
02:17:31.44 --> 02:17:35.44
But you knew their son and you buried their son.

3065
02:17:35.44 --> 02:17:41.44
And you were on your knees giving a mother the flag that was on her son's coffin.

3066
02:17:41.44 --> 02:17:47.44
And you get to know these people and you stay close to them, you know,

3067
02:17:47.44 --> 02:17:49.44
for a long, long period of time.

3068
02:17:49.44 --> 02:17:55.44
So, and I wound up there at Socom and, you know,

3069
02:17:55.44 --> 02:17:57.44
it was an interesting time for me.

3070
02:17:57.44 --> 02:17:59.44
It was a baby, baby one star.

3071
02:17:59.44 --> 02:18:01.44
And it was a small place.

3072
02:18:01.44 --> 02:18:04.44
We only had five flag in general offices then.

3073
02:18:04.44 --> 02:18:08.44
The four star, the three star, two green beret, two stars in me.

3074
02:18:08.44 --> 02:18:09.44
I was the baby.

3075
02:18:09.44 --> 02:18:13.44
But, we, it was a great place to learn.

3076
02:18:13.44 --> 02:18:16.44
And one of the offices there, Elden Bargewell,

3077
02:18:16.44 --> 02:18:19.44
was a special forces in general officer.

3078
02:18:19.44 --> 02:18:24.44
And up at two that point, Elden was the most highly decorated soldier

3079
02:18:24.44 --> 02:18:26.44
in the United States Army.

3080
02:18:26.44 --> 02:18:29.44
And, you know, school was certainly in session for me,

3081
02:18:29.44 --> 02:18:31.44
you know, working with Elden.

3082
02:18:31.44 --> 02:18:36.44
So that when I left there and then went to Naval Special Warfare to take over the community,

3083
02:18:36.44 --> 02:18:40.44
I left there as the deputy commander under Admiral Lerick Olson

3084
02:18:40.44 --> 02:18:43.44
and came back, you know, close to four years later.

3085
02:18:43.44 --> 02:18:47.44
And I just remember, you know, we've been recaptured by it before it.

3086
02:18:47.44 --> 02:18:50.44
Just so that after that she goes, oh my God,

3087
02:18:50.44 --> 02:18:52.44
you turned into an admiral.

3088
02:18:52.44 --> 02:18:55.44
We're, we're, you know, you had to.

3089
02:18:55.44 --> 02:18:57.44
Yeah, so.

3090
02:18:57.44 --> 02:19:00.44
My, my commanding officer at Seal Team 7,

3091
02:19:00.44 --> 02:19:02.44
I was on deployment as an Iraq,

3092
02:19:02.44 --> 02:19:04.44
having just the best deployment ever,

3093
02:19:04.44 --> 02:19:07.44
just having a great time doing a bunch of operations.

3094
02:19:07.44 --> 02:19:11.44
And, and he says to me, the last thing I do as commanding officer of Seal Team 7

3095
02:19:11.44 --> 02:19:15.44
is I'm going to make sure that you become the admiral's aide.

3096
02:19:15.44 --> 02:19:17.44
He pulled it off.

3097
02:19:17.44 --> 02:19:20.44
So that's where that's how you ended up with me.

3098
02:19:20.44 --> 02:19:23.44
Well, I'll tell you what, it was wonderful, you know,

3099
02:19:23.44 --> 02:19:27.44
between you and, you know, in beef treshler,

3100
02:19:27.44 --> 02:19:31.44
you know, you know, folks out there, you know, you've got a good idea what

3101
02:19:31.44 --> 02:19:35.44
Jaco looks like I'm sure, but beef used to be the center for Navy.

3102
02:19:35.44 --> 02:19:39.44
And he's also a pretty, pretty strong guy.

3103
02:19:39.44 --> 02:19:40.44
Well, my name is Jaco.

3104
02:19:40.44 --> 02:19:41.44
His name is beef.

3105
02:19:41.44 --> 02:19:43.44
No, no, kind of says it all.

3106
02:19:43.44 --> 02:19:45.44
But when, when, when, when, when,

3107
02:19:45.44 --> 02:19:47.44
Jaco, when beef was replacing Jaco,

3108
02:19:47.44 --> 02:19:50.44
we had the families over for dinner.

3109
02:19:50.44 --> 02:19:53.44
And, uh, we're, they're at dinner and my daughter is sitting there.

3110
02:19:53.44 --> 02:19:56.44
And she's probably about 10 at that point in time.

3111
02:19:56.44 --> 02:19:58.44
And she looks at the two of these guys.

3112
02:19:58.44 --> 02:20:01.44
And she honestly asks, beef and Jaco,

3113
02:20:01.44 --> 02:20:04.44
uh, you guys, my daddy's flag lieutenant,

3114
02:20:04.44 --> 02:20:07.44
or you guys, my daddy's body guards.

3115
02:20:07.44 --> 02:20:09.44
And the two of them go, yes.

3116
02:20:09.44 --> 02:20:11.44
I said, you guys screwed up.

3117
02:20:11.44 --> 02:20:13.44
You should've told him, he might daughter,

3118
02:20:13.44 --> 02:20:15.44
your daddy doesn't need a bodyguard.

3119
02:20:15.44 --> 02:20:17.44
But the truth in the matter is I sure did.

3120
02:20:17.44 --> 02:20:20.44
And if I had one, these two guys that could do it.

3121
02:20:20.44 --> 02:20:24.44
But, um, no, you know, what I, what I always asked,

3122
02:20:24.44 --> 02:20:27.44
I never interviewed anybody to be the, the, the flag lieutenant out there,

3123
02:20:27.44 --> 02:20:29.44
folks, what I would do to go to the senior officers,

3124
02:20:29.44 --> 02:20:31.44
I go to send me a champion.

3125
02:20:31.44 --> 02:20:33.44
Send me somebody who's just come out of combat.

3126
02:20:33.44 --> 02:20:35.44
Somebody somebody who's got a future ahead of them.

3127
02:20:35.44 --> 02:20:38.44
Somebody somebody who's willing to work really hard.

3128
02:20:38.44 --> 02:20:41.44
Um, and because, you know,

3129
02:20:41.44 --> 02:20:44.44
don't use the flag lieutenant in the aid to carry my bag.

3130
02:20:44.44 --> 02:20:45.44
I carried my own bag.

3131
02:20:45.44 --> 02:20:48.44
What I needed was to bring a lieutenant into the meeting

3132
02:20:48.44 --> 02:20:52.44
to hear what was being briefed or what we needed to be

3133
02:20:52.44 --> 02:20:55.44
resource and be able to turn to that lieutenant and say

3134
02:20:55.44 --> 02:20:56.44
to the med need this.

3135
02:20:56.44 --> 02:20:57.44
Is this what they want?

3136
02:20:57.44 --> 02:20:59.44
Well, what do they want that we have?

3137
02:20:59.44 --> 02:21:02.44
And, you know, I, because that individual,

3138
02:21:02.44 --> 02:21:04.44
whether it was, you know,

3139
02:21:04.44 --> 02:21:07.44
a jocco or beef came right out of the battlefield.

3140
02:21:07.44 --> 02:21:09.44
Um, and had that credibility.

3141
02:21:09.44 --> 02:21:10.44
It was only a year.

3142
02:21:10.44 --> 02:21:11.44
They're turning the barrel.

3143
02:21:11.44 --> 02:21:12.44
And it's a very demanding job.

3144
02:21:12.44 --> 02:21:14.44
I had been a flag lieutenant myself.

3145
02:21:14.44 --> 02:21:15.44
I understand that.

3146
02:21:15.44 --> 02:21:17.44
But, um, it was just.

3147
02:21:17.44 --> 02:21:21.44
Jocco was a tremendous resource for not only me,

3148
02:21:21.44 --> 02:21:23.44
but the community.

3149
02:21:23.44 --> 02:21:26.44
And then as well, when Jocco then went back into,

3150
02:21:26.44 --> 02:21:29.44
you know, his seal team and become a test unit commander,

3151
02:21:29.44 --> 02:21:32.44
he almost becomes like an apostle to the rest of the community

3152
02:21:32.44 --> 02:21:35.44
to explain why we do what we do because now he knew he'd

3153
02:21:35.44 --> 02:21:36.44
picked up the inner psyched.

3154
02:21:36.44 --> 02:21:38.44
But, uh, it was an absolute honor.

3155
02:21:38.44 --> 02:21:40.44
And, you know, the way I considered the,

3156
02:21:40.44 --> 02:21:43.44
the, the be, you know, you and me are relationship.

3157
02:21:43.44 --> 02:21:45.44
It's just like in any relationship and the teams,

3158
02:21:45.44 --> 02:21:46.44
we was one bunnies.

3159
02:21:46.44 --> 02:21:47.44
And that's just really.

3160
02:21:47.44 --> 02:21:48.44
We had each other's sex.

3161
02:21:48.44 --> 02:21:49.44
We had each other's back.

3162
02:21:49.44 --> 02:21:52.44
But, I mean, very, very heavily on you and you never,

3163
02:21:52.44 --> 02:21:53.44
never let me down.

3164
02:21:53.44 --> 02:21:55.44
You always came through, Jocco.

3165
02:21:55.44 --> 02:21:55.44
Yeah.

3166
02:21:55.44 --> 02:21:58.44
And then, um, obviously when we were going through that deployment

3167
02:21:58.44 --> 02:21:59.44
in Ramadhi, it was just awesome.

3168
02:21:59.44 --> 02:22:01.44
Like I started this as off, you know,

3169
02:22:01.44 --> 02:22:03.44
this is the support that you gave me.

3170
02:22:03.44 --> 02:22:06.44
And thereby the rest of my, my task, you know,

3171
02:22:06.44 --> 02:22:08.44
was just, it was awesome.

3172
02:22:08.44 --> 02:22:12.44
Well, you know, we were a community at war.

3173
02:22:12.44 --> 02:22:13.44
It was on our shoulders.

3174
02:22:13.44 --> 02:22:16.44
And I know that you were taking it very hard,

3175
02:22:16.44 --> 02:22:18.44
because, you know, we were taking some heavies.

3176
02:22:18.44 --> 02:22:22.44
But, um, when you're at war, you have to realize you're at war.

3177
02:22:22.44 --> 02:22:26.44
And, um, you know, there's going to be casualties.

3178
02:22:26.44 --> 02:22:29.44
And, but, you know, at the end of the day,

3179
02:22:29.44 --> 02:22:32.44
you were highly successful in your mission.

3180
02:22:32.44 --> 02:22:34.44
And you came out of that with, uh,

3181
02:22:34.44 --> 02:22:35.44
extreme, high regard.

3182
02:22:35.44 --> 02:22:39.44
But, um, you know, to me, you know,

3183
02:22:39.44 --> 02:22:41.44
several years later, as you know,

3184
02:22:41.44 --> 02:22:45.44
we're christening a navy land attack cruise

3185
02:22:45.44 --> 02:22:47.44
or up in Beth Maine.

3186
02:22:47.44 --> 02:22:51.44
And, um, one of the great honest that I've ever had,

3187
02:22:51.44 --> 02:22:53.44
was normally when you christen a ship.

3188
02:22:53.44 --> 02:22:55.44
I mean, everybody there, a senator is congressman.

3189
02:22:55.44 --> 02:22:58.44
And the secretary of the navy is the guest speaker,

3190
02:22:58.44 --> 02:22:59.44
the main speaker.

3191
02:22:59.44 --> 02:23:03.44
And because of my relationship with, with, with Mikey Montsour,

3192
02:23:03.44 --> 02:23:06.44
uh, and with you in test, test,

3193
02:23:06.44 --> 02:23:09.44
you know, bruiser, uh, that the secretary of the navy

3194
02:23:09.44 --> 02:23:11.44
asked me to be the guest speaker there.

3195
02:23:11.44 --> 02:23:14.44
But, uh, I think I also mentioned the speaker.

3196
02:23:14.44 --> 02:23:16.44
You know, it was test-givin' a bruiser

3197
02:23:16.44 --> 02:23:18.44
if you got any questions or why we call it that.

3198
02:23:18.44 --> 02:23:19.44
Look at Lieutenant Emmanuel.

3199
02:23:19.44 --> 02:23:23.44
Well, that's awesome.

3200
02:23:23.44 --> 02:23:26.44
I know we probably could talk for another few hours,

3201
02:23:26.44 --> 02:23:27.44
and I know that you got to go.

3202
02:23:27.44 --> 02:23:30.44
Which pretty much to mean means at some point you got to come back

3203
02:23:30.44 --> 02:23:32.44
and we can tell the rest of your story, uh,

3204
02:23:32.44 --> 02:23:34.44
because this was not the end of your career,

3205
02:23:34.44 --> 02:23:35.44
uh, of service.

3206
02:23:35.44 --> 02:23:37.44
And you ended up doing much more.

3207
02:23:37.44 --> 02:23:40.44
And, um, yeah, we, we'll have to come back

3208
02:23:40.44 --> 02:23:42.44
in next time you're in Coronado.

3209
02:23:42.44 --> 02:23:44.44
We'll come up and finish the rest of the story.

3210
02:23:44.44 --> 02:23:47.44
Yeah, well, I tell you, Jaco, I'd love to come back.

3211
02:23:47.44 --> 02:23:49.44
And we've had a great visit here in Coronado

3212
02:23:49.44 --> 02:23:52.44
with the center-changer command visiting our teammates,

3213
02:23:52.44 --> 02:23:55.44
uh, spending, you know, three and a half, four hours,

3214
02:23:55.44 --> 02:23:57.44
getting briefs from on the community this morning.

3215
02:23:57.44 --> 02:23:58.44
It's just inspirational.

3216
02:23:58.44 --> 02:24:02.44
And, um, you know, I believe in a life of service,

3217
02:24:02.44 --> 02:24:05.44
and, um, uh, and as far as a leader is concerned,

3218
02:24:05.44 --> 02:24:09.44
you know, you've got to be a, you know, a leader who sacrifices, uh,

3219
02:24:09.44 --> 02:24:12.44
you know, and when I was asked to come back in the government,

3220
02:24:12.44 --> 02:24:14.44
it wasn't on my scope at all,

3221
02:24:14.44 --> 02:24:18.44
but I came back in and, uh, you know, wound up being the director

3222
02:24:18.44 --> 02:24:20.44
of the National Counter-Tourism Center,

3223
02:24:20.44 --> 02:24:22.44
which I was very comfortable in that.

3224
02:24:22.44 --> 02:24:25.44
It was my strike zone, uh, but then when the president asked me

3225
02:24:25.44 --> 02:24:28.44
to come to the director of National Intelligence,

3226
02:24:28.44 --> 02:24:30.44
not necessarily my strikes on him there,

3227
02:24:30.44 --> 02:24:33.44
but I will tell you, uh, to, to start off,

3228
02:24:33.44 --> 02:24:36.44
uh, and have a rubble boat in your head, uh,

3229
02:24:36.44 --> 02:24:40.44
and then years later, you know, you're sitting there as the president's intelligence officer,

3230
02:24:40.44 --> 02:24:43.44
uh, at the National Security Council,

3231
02:24:43.44 --> 02:24:46.44
and even, you know, I had an interesting time there,

3232
02:24:46.44 --> 02:24:49.44
I'm sure you know that I, I had a testimony, uh,

3233
02:24:49.44 --> 02:24:53.44
there for three and a half hours, uh, the House, uh,

3234
02:24:53.44 --> 02:24:57.44
the Senate Committee on Intelligence, uh, had had to do with the whistleblower complaint,

3235
02:24:57.44 --> 02:24:59.44
but right, you know, for three and a half hours, you're on camera,

3236
02:24:59.44 --> 02:25:02.44
and you've got some, you know, very, very bright and, uh,

3237
02:25:02.44 --> 02:25:05.44
talented people asking you some demanding questions,

3238
02:25:05.44 --> 02:25:09.44
but it was a, the very first time that I was really, really happy

3239
02:25:09.44 --> 02:25:11.44
that I went to high risk here,

3240
02:25:11.44 --> 02:25:14.44
and I'm just doing deterioration techniques.

3241
02:25:14.44 --> 02:25:17.44
I'll tell you what, uh, even as that,

3242
02:25:17.44 --> 02:25:19.44
I knew that was happening, and I sat down and watched it,

3243
02:25:19.44 --> 02:25:21.44
and, and, and you can, you know,

3244
02:25:21.44 --> 02:25:23.44
they look like sharks in the water, you can see them there,

3245
02:25:23.44 --> 02:25:25.44
they're thinking they're going to go, even though,

3246
02:25:25.44 --> 02:25:27.44
who you got? Number one is from Brooklyn. Number one,

3247
02:25:27.44 --> 02:25:29.44
number two is in the teams, Harvard,

3248
02:25:29.44 --> 02:25:33.44
the whole nine yards, they said, this is going to go as well as they think it's going to go.

3249
02:25:33.44 --> 02:25:36.44
No, I didn't, you know, let's say a lot. Um,

3250
02:25:36.44 --> 02:25:39.44
no, I've made that, uh, it was,

3251
02:25:39.44 --> 02:25:41.44
because I, I will tell you this, though,

3252
02:25:41.44 --> 02:25:43.44
Chaco, there, um,

3253
02:25:43.44 --> 02:25:46.44
not only was I represented the, the entire United States and

3254
02:25:46.44 --> 02:25:51.44
the United States and Telegis community, but having spent 36 years in our community, you know,

3255
02:25:51.44 --> 02:25:54.44
I really feel like, you know, here I am, I know I'm on national TV,

3256
02:25:54.44 --> 02:25:56.44
and it's going to be a, uh, a pretty important hearing,

3257
02:25:56.44 --> 02:25:59.44
which probably would lead to what it did. Um,

3258
02:25:59.44 --> 02:26:03.44
and I just, I'm still representing the United States Navy and,

3259
02:26:03.44 --> 02:26:05.44
our special operations community.

3260
02:26:05.44 --> 02:26:10.44
So I just figured, well, I'm going to do is tell the truth and play it straight.

3261
02:26:10.44 --> 02:26:11.44
Mm-hmm.

3262
02:26:11.44 --> 02:26:14.44
Mm-hmm. And, um, and, um, and, and I did,

3263
02:26:14.44 --> 02:26:17.44
I did, um, and I, um, I think, uh, at the end of it,

3264
02:26:17.44 --> 02:26:22.44
I felt like, um, I did my job and I was able to leave with my head held high.

3265
02:26:22.44 --> 02:26:23.44
Yeah, well, that was the other thing I knew.

3266
02:26:23.44 --> 02:26:26.44
I knew you were from Brooklyn. I knew you were from the teams.

3267
02:26:26.44 --> 02:26:28.44
I knew that you went to Harvard in the whole nine yards,

3268
02:26:28.44 --> 02:26:33.44
but I also knew that if they were looking for something that you had done,

3269
02:26:33.44 --> 02:26:36.44
that was a moral illegal or an ethical,

3270
02:26:36.44 --> 02:26:40.44
I knew that they could not find it and they would not find it because I,

3271
02:26:40.44 --> 02:26:44.44
I know you and I know that you do the right thing.

3272
02:26:44.44 --> 02:26:47.44
And so that's why I watched that with, uh, with great joy.

3273
02:26:47.44 --> 02:26:50.44
Yeah, well, well, just before I got the job,

3274
02:26:50.44 --> 02:26:52.44
we was at the White House Chief of Staff,

3275
02:26:52.44 --> 02:26:55.44
Mick Mowaney did the vetting, uh,

3276
02:26:55.44 --> 02:26:56.44
and, uh, you know, Mick told me,

3277
02:26:56.44 --> 02:26:58.44
said, you know, I've talked to everybody,

3278
02:26:58.44 --> 02:27:00.44
especially everybody in the special operations community.

3279
02:27:00.44 --> 02:27:03.44
And I couldn't find one person to say something negative about you.

3280
02:27:03.44 --> 02:27:05.44
Now, I hadn't been offered the job yet.

3281
02:27:05.44 --> 02:27:08.44
I said, Mick, give me a day. I'll give you a list of people.

3282
02:27:08.44 --> 02:27:13.44
I did, I, I, I, I, I, I don't necessarily want that job.

3283
02:27:13.44 --> 02:27:15.44
But I got it and it went okay.

3284
02:27:15.44 --> 02:27:17.44
A joke always been a great honor.

3285
02:27:17.44 --> 02:27:19.44
It's going to be with you, uh,

3286
02:27:19.44 --> 02:27:20.44
and it's always going to be with the teammate,

3287
02:27:20.44 --> 02:27:22.44
but I'm, I'm so proud of you.

3288
02:27:22.44 --> 02:27:24.44
Finalty, what you did with when you were in uniform,

3289
02:27:24.44 --> 02:27:29.44
but, uh, you know, what you have accomplished is for as just not only personally,

3290
02:27:29.44 --> 02:27:31.44
but the way you've been offered to give back with your leadership,

3291
02:27:31.44 --> 02:27:33.44
and, uh, what you're sharing with the world,

3292
02:27:33.44 --> 02:27:35.44
whether you're Brooks, your podcast,

3293
02:27:35.44 --> 02:27:38.44
and there's so many people that I know that listen to this podcast,

3294
02:27:38.44 --> 02:27:41.44
read your books and really learn a great deal about leadership,

3295
02:27:41.44 --> 02:27:43.44
and, um, you know, folks, I tell you,

3296
02:27:43.44 --> 02:27:46.44
uh, when people ask me, do I know what I'm, I do,

3297
02:27:46.44 --> 02:27:48.44
as either, you know, as you, as you, as you, as you, as you real deal,

3298
02:27:48.44 --> 02:27:49.44
he's the real deal.

3299
02:27:49.44 --> 02:27:53.44
And, uh, I've honored more than I could possibly tell you to be with you today,

3300
02:27:53.44 --> 02:27:57.44
and folks, you know, I do plan on taking Chocco back up on this orphaned

3301
02:27:57.44 --> 02:27:59.44
come back and visit you with you sometime in the future.

3302
02:27:59.44 --> 02:28:00.44
So thank you, my friend.

3303
02:28:00.44 --> 02:28:04.44
Be outstanding. And the things I say today are the things I learned from people like you

3304
02:28:04.44 --> 02:28:07.44
from our great community, and thanks for coming to Chocco us.

3305
02:28:07.44 --> 02:28:09.44
More important.

3306
02:28:09.44 --> 02:28:12.44
Thank you for everything that you've done for America, for the Navy,

3307
02:28:12.44 --> 02:28:15.44
for the teams, and of course, for me.

3308
02:28:15.44 --> 02:28:17.44
It was an honor to serve with you,

3309
02:28:17.44 --> 02:28:19.44
and I look forward to talking to you again.

3310
02:28:19.44 --> 02:28:21.44
Like what Chocco, thank you.

3311
02:28:21.44 --> 02:28:26.44
And with that, Admiral, Joe McGuire has left the building,

3312
02:28:26.44 --> 02:28:29.44
and echo you didn't even get a chance to sort of ask a question.

3313
02:28:29.44 --> 02:28:33.44
We were moving pretty quick, and he had another event,

3314
02:28:33.44 --> 02:28:35.44
to attend.

3315
02:28:35.44 --> 02:28:37.44
So you have to save you or whatever.

3316
02:28:37.44 --> 02:28:38.44
Did you have any questions?

3317
02:28:38.44 --> 02:28:39.44
Not at the moment.

3318
02:28:39.44 --> 02:28:42.44
I actually asked the one, what's the lockout thing?

3319
02:28:42.44 --> 02:28:43.44
Yeah.

3320
02:28:43.44 --> 02:28:44.44
There's a lot of little stuff, man.

3321
02:28:44.44 --> 02:28:47.44
You know, then I'm like, hey, wait, what is that?

3322
02:28:47.44 --> 02:28:50.44
Not even necessarily because I don't know what it is,

3323
02:28:50.44 --> 02:28:51.44
and I need clarification.

3324
02:28:51.44 --> 02:28:53.44
A lot of times it's like, I don't know what that is,

3325
02:28:53.44 --> 02:28:55.44
but it sounds kind of interesting.

3326
02:28:55.44 --> 02:28:58.44
Maybe not to you guys, because that's part of your guy's everyday thing at the time,

3327
02:28:58.44 --> 02:29:00.44
but for me, it's like, man, even that lockout thing.

3328
02:29:00.44 --> 02:29:04.44
That's interesting. And I think it's one of those things where,

3329
02:29:04.44 --> 02:29:09.44
imagine if you were hearing a Gigiitsu story about your cotton and arm lock,

3330
02:29:09.44 --> 02:29:12.44
and you were, then they had to triangle two and you,

3331
02:29:12.44 --> 02:29:15.44
all I would need to tell you, since you know Gigiitsu,

3332
02:29:15.44 --> 02:29:17.44
if I was like, hey, I was caught in the arm lock,

3333
02:29:17.44 --> 02:29:20.44
and the triangle both at the same time,

3334
02:29:20.44 --> 02:29:22.44
I started having the walls closed in.

3335
02:29:22.44 --> 02:29:24.44
You would know what that meant.

3336
02:29:24.44 --> 02:29:25.44
Yeah.

3337
02:29:25.44 --> 02:29:27.44
Someone that doesn't understand Gigiitsu is just like,

3338
02:29:27.44 --> 02:29:30.44
it doesn't really mean that much to them.

3339
02:29:30.44 --> 02:29:32.44
In fact, it almost means nothing to them.

3340
02:29:32.44 --> 02:29:36.44
So when that animal was talking about that whole walkout thing

3341
02:29:36.44 --> 02:29:41.44
and the German U-boat, that is a crazy story.

3342
02:29:41.44 --> 02:29:43.44
That is a crazy story.

3343
02:29:43.44 --> 02:29:48.44
The clostrophobia, the changes in pressures.

3344
02:29:48.44 --> 02:29:50.44
Did that come across?

3345
02:29:50.44 --> 02:29:53.44
Could you recognize how freaking crazy that was?

3346
02:29:53.44 --> 02:29:55.44
Yeah, so it did come across,

3347
02:29:55.44 --> 02:29:57.44
but you know what else was clear to me that,

3348
02:29:57.44 --> 02:29:59.44
what you were explaining right now?

3349
02:29:59.44 --> 02:30:00.44
That was the case.

3350
02:30:00.44 --> 02:30:02.44
And I did not want to interrupt at all.

3351
02:30:02.44 --> 02:30:04.44
I mean, aside from, at least so I can grasp

3352
02:30:04.44 --> 02:30:06.44
and understanding of what the lockout procedure is,

3353
02:30:06.44 --> 02:30:07.44
right, no even more.

3354
02:30:07.44 --> 02:30:08.44
But yeah, so the clostrophobia thing,

3355
02:30:08.44 --> 02:30:10.44
anytime you guys talk about submarines,

3356
02:30:10.44 --> 02:30:11.44
I do remind myself,

3357
02:30:11.44 --> 02:30:12.44
come my friend, Jiren, he'd tell me,

3358
02:30:12.44 --> 02:30:14.44
would tell me about like,

3359
02:30:14.44 --> 02:30:17.44
these submarines, and there's those little diver vehicle things.

3360
02:30:17.44 --> 02:30:19.44
So seal delivery vehicles.

3361
02:30:19.44 --> 02:30:21.44
Yeah, so he'd tell me about that,

3362
02:30:21.44 --> 02:30:22.44
and it's like,

3363
02:30:22.44 --> 02:30:25.44
it's not like cool, like on the movies,

3364
02:30:25.44 --> 02:30:27.44
you guys are cruising into office with that.

3365
02:30:27.44 --> 02:30:29.44
The thing is like super cramped and super,

3366
02:30:29.44 --> 02:30:32.44
and I don't like that clostrophobia stuff.

3367
02:30:32.44 --> 02:30:33.44
Yeah, I know.

3368
02:30:33.44 --> 02:30:34.44
We'll put it this way.

3369
02:30:34.44 --> 02:30:36.44
I'm attuned to certain cramped.

3370
02:30:36.44 --> 02:30:38.44
Twenty one inch tube.

3371
02:30:38.44 --> 02:30:39.44
Like I see.

3372
02:30:39.44 --> 02:30:40.44
Twenty one inch tube.

3373
02:30:40.44 --> 02:30:41.44
Yeah.

3374
02:30:41.44 --> 02:30:43.44
Yeah, so you guys are talking about that,

3375
02:30:43.44 --> 02:30:44.44
and I'm like boom, and then yes,

3376
02:30:44.44 --> 02:30:46.44
then you guys are talking about these procedures,

3377
02:30:46.44 --> 02:30:48.44
like, oh, we all know those procedures are.

3378
02:30:48.44 --> 02:30:49.44
I'm like, wait a second,

3379
02:30:49.44 --> 02:30:50.44
we have claustrophobia,

3380
02:30:50.44 --> 02:30:52.44
you got freaking the submarine here.

3381
02:30:52.44 --> 02:30:53.44
Underwater, you're doing all this stuff.

3382
02:30:53.44 --> 02:30:54.44
I don't want to hear more.

3383
02:30:54.44 --> 02:30:55.44
It's kind of nuts, you know?

3384
02:30:55.44 --> 02:30:58.44
But that's not that wasn't the point that he was making at the time.

3385
02:30:58.44 --> 02:31:01.44
So it's like, I don't want to derail the momentum of the conversation.

3386
02:31:01.44 --> 02:31:03.44
Yeah, well, at some point,

3387
02:31:03.44 --> 02:31:07.44
maybe we'll go into a little more detail about what those types of operations are like.

3388
02:31:07.44 --> 02:31:08.44
I was lucky,

3389
02:31:08.44 --> 02:31:11.44
because when I came in to the teams,

3390
02:31:11.44 --> 02:31:13.44
we still did that in the normal teams.

3391
02:31:13.44 --> 02:31:15.44
And once the war kicked off,

3392
02:31:15.44 --> 02:31:17.44
we didn't really do submarine mockouts

3393
02:31:17.44 --> 02:31:19.44
and the normal teams very often.

3394
02:31:19.44 --> 02:31:20.44
If at all,

3395
02:31:20.44 --> 02:31:21.44
not to mention,

3396
02:31:21.44 --> 02:31:24.44
we used to just dive like it was going out of style.

3397
02:31:24.44 --> 02:31:26.44
Like it was going out of style.

3398
02:31:26.44 --> 02:31:28.44
And once again, once the war started,

3399
02:31:28.44 --> 02:31:30.44
we're fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan.

3400
02:31:30.44 --> 02:31:32.44
We're not doing a bunch of combat swimmer dives

3401
02:31:32.44 --> 02:31:35.44
to prepare training dives to prepare to go to Iraq.

3402
02:31:35.44 --> 02:31:36.44
Like there's some rivers,

3403
02:31:36.44 --> 02:31:41.44
but we're not doing harbor infiltration on draggers.

3404
02:31:41.44 --> 02:31:46.44
But I was lucky enough to be able to do that a bunch of bunch.

3405
02:31:46.44 --> 02:31:49.44
And just get some of that,

3406
02:31:49.44 --> 02:31:51.44
get some of that.

3407
02:31:51.44 --> 02:31:53.44
It is a freaking hard job, man.

3408
02:31:53.44 --> 02:31:54.44
It's a hard job.

3409
02:31:54.44 --> 02:31:58.44
You mentioned something kind of kind of impassingly kind of quick,

3410
02:31:58.44 --> 02:32:02.44
where you have the operation,

3411
02:32:02.44 --> 02:32:07.44
but all the steps to go through the operation are just completely painful,

3412
02:32:07.44 --> 02:32:08.44
like completely painful.

3413
02:32:08.44 --> 02:32:09.44
So like, you know,

3414
02:32:09.44 --> 02:32:11.44
you talk about the temperature of the water.

3415
02:32:11.44 --> 02:32:16.44
If you haven't swim or been in 40,

3416
02:32:16.44 --> 02:32:19.44
30 something degree where I have ice bath scenario,

3417
02:32:19.44 --> 02:32:21.44
whatever, but nonetheless,

3418
02:32:21.44 --> 02:32:23.44
I know what that feels like on that prow.

3419
02:32:23.44 --> 02:32:26.44
What if that was just your world, you know?

3420
02:32:26.44 --> 02:32:28.44
That's your world.

3421
02:32:28.44 --> 02:32:30.44
That was what was interesting.

3422
02:32:30.44 --> 02:32:32.44
He was talking about getting into the submarine.

3423
02:32:32.44 --> 02:32:34.44
After jumping out of an airplane

3424
02:32:34.44 --> 02:32:36.44
and then landing in the middle of the ocean,

3425
02:32:36.44 --> 02:32:38.44
then you rock into the submarine,

3426
02:32:38.44 --> 02:32:39.44
going.

3427
02:32:39.44 --> 02:32:41.44
One person goes in thin first.

3428
02:32:41.44 --> 02:32:42.44
It's crazy.

3429
02:32:42.44 --> 02:32:44.44
And by the way, then you're just on the submarine.

3430
02:32:44.44 --> 02:32:45.44
You still haven't even done the mission yet.

3431
02:32:45.44 --> 02:32:46.44
You're not even close.

3432
02:32:46.44 --> 02:32:48.44
You're not even close.

3433
02:32:48.44 --> 02:32:50.44
You haven't even started the mission yet.

3434
02:32:50.44 --> 02:32:51.44
Yeah.

3435
02:32:51.44 --> 02:32:52.44
Yeah.

3436
02:32:52.44 --> 02:32:54.44
So yeah, so it's like that kind of stuff where it's like,

3437
02:32:54.44 --> 02:32:58.44
man, you can elaborate on the feeling of like a 10 second period

3438
02:32:58.44 --> 02:33:01.44
for a long time and really paint that picture.

3439
02:33:01.44 --> 02:33:02.44
That would be interesting.

3440
02:33:02.44 --> 02:33:03.44
I'll be nuts.

3441
02:33:03.44 --> 02:33:05.44
We'll have to get through at the some point.

3442
02:33:05.44 --> 02:33:08.44
Nonetheless, as you like to say,

3443
02:33:08.44 --> 02:33:11.44
we might not be in those scenarios,

3444
02:33:11.44 --> 02:33:14.44
but we want to be ready for various scenarios.

3445
02:33:14.44 --> 02:33:19.44
We want to improve our capabilities for diving, swimming,

3446
02:33:19.44 --> 02:33:23.44
shooting, living, fighting, whatever we're doing.

3447
02:33:23.44 --> 02:33:25.44
Whatever we're doing.

3448
02:33:25.44 --> 02:33:28.44
How do we improve our capabilities a little bit here and there?

3449
02:33:28.44 --> 02:33:29.44
We think I could just wish you were starting.

3450
02:33:29.44 --> 02:33:31.44
Interestingly, you talk about diving and swimming

3451
02:33:31.44 --> 02:33:33.44
about a man that's a few months ago.

3452
02:33:33.44 --> 02:33:35.44
So I didn't know that masks

3453
02:33:35.44 --> 02:33:40.44
for diving stuff had that many levels to...

3454
02:33:40.44 --> 02:33:41.44
There's levels.

3455
02:33:41.44 --> 02:33:43.44
There's some good masks anyway.

3456
02:33:43.44 --> 02:33:45.44
I got a good one and I was like,

3457
02:33:45.44 --> 02:33:46.44
all right.

3458
02:33:46.44 --> 02:33:49.44
Makes you kind of want to go swimming more too, by the way.

3459
02:33:49.44 --> 02:33:51.44
So it's like when you get these things,

3460
02:33:51.44 --> 02:33:55.44
it kind of pushes you into the game a little bit more.

3461
02:33:55.44 --> 02:33:56.44
All right.

3462
02:33:56.44 --> 02:33:57.44
All right.

3463
02:33:57.44 --> 02:33:59.44
So what are we doing?

3464
02:33:59.44 --> 02:34:00.44
We're working out.

3465
02:34:00.44 --> 02:34:01.44
We're eating.

3466
02:34:01.44 --> 02:34:02.44
We're listening.

3467
02:34:02.44 --> 02:34:03.44
True.

3468
02:34:03.44 --> 02:34:07.44
When I say working out, there's various kinds of workouts.

3469
02:34:07.44 --> 02:34:10.44
Obviously, there's jujitsu, there's weights, running,

3470
02:34:10.44 --> 02:34:12.44
cardio, macons, all this stuff.

3471
02:34:12.44 --> 02:34:15.44
Nonetheless, you can take some damage on the way.

3472
02:34:15.44 --> 02:34:17.44
That's some dom, right now.

3473
02:34:17.44 --> 02:34:19.44
By the way, it's got to yesterday's side now.

3474
02:34:19.44 --> 02:34:21.44
And conditioning.

3475
02:34:21.44 --> 02:34:23.44
Nonetheless, you might need supplementation.

3476
02:34:23.44 --> 02:34:25.44
So good news is,

3477
02:34:25.44 --> 02:34:26.44
Jocquass supplementation.

3478
02:34:26.44 --> 02:34:29.44
So first, we'll start with a cognitive and physical stuff.

3479
02:34:29.44 --> 02:34:31.44
Discipline, go.

3480
02:34:31.44 --> 02:34:35.44
Kind of groundbreaking in a way.

3481
02:34:35.44 --> 02:34:36.44
Very.

3482
02:34:36.44 --> 02:34:37.44
Yes.

3483
02:34:37.44 --> 02:34:38.44
So let's start with the cans.

3484
02:34:38.44 --> 02:34:39.44
So energy drink.

3485
02:34:39.44 --> 02:34:40.44
Boom.

3486
02:34:40.44 --> 02:34:41.44
It's the new energy drink already.

3487
02:34:41.44 --> 02:34:42.44
Established, ready?

3488
02:34:42.44 --> 02:34:43.44
Yeah.

3489
02:34:43.44 --> 02:34:45.44
The new wave, the new paradigm.

3490
02:34:45.44 --> 02:34:46.44
Isn't it funny?

3491
02:34:46.44 --> 02:34:48.44
There was all these other companies making,

3492
02:34:48.44 --> 02:34:49.44
quote, energy drinks.

3493
02:34:49.44 --> 02:34:54.44
And none of them saw this big, just giant gap in the market.

3494
02:34:54.44 --> 02:34:57.44
They were just saying, oh, we'll put more sugar and more caffeine.

3495
02:34:57.44 --> 02:34:58.44
Yeah.

3496
02:34:58.44 --> 02:35:00.44
And more people will buy it.

3497
02:35:00.44 --> 02:35:04.44
And they didn't see this big hole a bunch of people actually wanted to drink things that were healthy.

3498
02:35:04.44 --> 02:35:06.44
And actually gave them real energy,

3499
02:35:06.44 --> 02:35:09.44
not just a freaking sugar rush.

3500
02:35:09.44 --> 02:35:13.44
Most applied times a caffeine jitter and call that energy.

3501
02:35:13.44 --> 02:35:15.44
So anyways, they didn't see it.

3502
02:35:15.44 --> 02:35:16.44
Cool. We did.

3503
02:35:16.44 --> 02:35:17.44
Here we are.

3504
02:35:17.44 --> 02:35:19.44
Yeah, and I get it because, like, you know,

3505
02:35:19.44 --> 02:35:22.44
as a company or whatever, like you kind of,

3506
02:35:22.44 --> 02:35:25.44
some, let's just say, some groups kind of play off of

3507
02:35:25.44 --> 02:35:29.44
weaknesses of our brains or whatever and go for that.

3508
02:35:29.44 --> 02:35:32.44
Superfish, you know, whether it be palatable,

3509
02:35:32.44 --> 02:35:37.44
you know, just that easy, that easy win, you know, tactical.

3510
02:35:37.44 --> 02:35:39.44
And they can play off of that.

3511
02:35:39.44 --> 02:35:40.44
And you can get some good numbers with that.

3512
02:35:40.44 --> 02:35:41.44
That's the thing.

3513
02:35:41.44 --> 02:35:43.44
So they play on like people's weakness in a way.

3514
02:35:43.44 --> 02:35:46.44
Play on the short term gratification of human beings.

3515
02:35:46.44 --> 02:35:47.44
Yes.

3516
02:35:47.44 --> 02:35:50.44
So if you call that a weakness,

3517
02:35:50.44 --> 02:35:51.44
and we're playing their weakness, right?

3518
02:35:51.44 --> 02:35:53.44
But think good thing about this is, you know,

3519
02:35:53.44 --> 02:35:55.44
playing people's weakness.

3520
02:35:55.44 --> 02:35:57.44
You actually play on their strengths to be honest with you.

3521
02:35:57.44 --> 02:36:00.44
You helped their long term strategic goals.

3522
02:36:00.44 --> 02:36:01.44
Oh, yeah.

3523
02:36:01.44 --> 02:36:04.44
But the good thing, or one of the many good things about this

3524
02:36:04.44 --> 02:36:06.44
is that it's both short term and long term.

3525
02:36:06.44 --> 02:36:07.44
It's amazing.

3526
02:36:07.44 --> 02:36:09.44
Discipline go the energy.

3527
02:36:09.44 --> 02:36:13.44
And actually the one that is the most short term pay off

3528
02:36:13.44 --> 02:36:17.44
as far as taste goes is the mango.

3529
02:36:17.44 --> 02:36:19.44
Actually speaking, even though you're drinking

3530
02:36:19.44 --> 02:36:20.44
a what pass watermelon.

3531
02:36:20.44 --> 02:36:21.44
Well, you know, you ran out.

3532
02:36:21.44 --> 02:36:22.44
You're right now.

3533
02:36:22.44 --> 02:36:24.44
You're in short supply.

3534
02:36:24.44 --> 02:36:26.44
I will say this one thing that's cool about these drinks

3535
02:36:26.44 --> 02:36:29.44
the different flavors taste actually taste different.

3536
02:36:29.44 --> 02:36:33.44
It's not like the some other quote energy drinks

3537
02:36:33.44 --> 02:36:36.44
that you can there's a bunch of flavors,

3538
02:36:36.44 --> 02:36:39.44
but they're all just basically tastes like sugar water.

3539
02:36:39.44 --> 02:36:40.44
Yeah.

3540
02:36:40.44 --> 02:36:41.44
Whatever.

3541
02:36:41.44 --> 02:36:42.44
Yeah.

3542
02:36:42.44 --> 02:36:45.44
You know, it's been a long time since I had any other energy drinks,

3543
02:36:45.44 --> 02:36:48.44
but yeah, I can remember that that was kind of the case.

3544
02:36:48.44 --> 02:36:49.44
One way or another.

3545
02:36:49.44 --> 02:36:50.44
Nonetheless, okay.

3546
02:36:50.44 --> 02:36:51.44
So discipline go.

3547
02:36:51.44 --> 02:36:53.44
This is if you haven't gathered already.

3548
02:36:53.44 --> 02:36:55.44
It's a healthy energy drink.

3549
02:36:55.44 --> 02:36:59.44
You will literally be better off after you drink it

3550
02:36:59.44 --> 02:37:00.44
than before you drink it.

3551
02:37:00.44 --> 02:37:02.44
And if it feels all your energy drink needs.

3552
02:37:02.44 --> 02:37:03.44
Very legit.

3553
02:37:03.44 --> 02:37:04.44
Very legit.

3554
02:37:04.44 --> 02:37:07.44
There's also like the mix, discipline go, the mix.

3555
02:37:07.44 --> 02:37:10.44
Mix up with water, whatever on the go and capsules.

3556
02:37:10.44 --> 02:37:12.44
So keep this in mind.

3557
02:37:12.44 --> 02:37:16.44
First cognitive and physical supplementation in general.

3558
02:37:16.44 --> 02:37:18.44
Also get your immune system in check.

3559
02:37:18.44 --> 02:37:19.44
Vitamin D3.

3560
02:37:19.44 --> 02:37:20.44
We got some cold war.

3561
02:37:20.44 --> 02:37:23.44
We got the joint night nins.

3562
02:37:23.44 --> 02:37:26.44
And repair kind of both in one.

3563
02:37:26.44 --> 02:37:27.44
Get some joint warfare.

3564
02:37:27.44 --> 02:37:28.44
Get some krill oil.

3565
02:37:28.44 --> 02:37:32.44
And of course, of course, glory be to the protein.

3566
02:37:32.44 --> 02:37:34.44
God's we have more.

3567
02:37:34.44 --> 02:37:35.44
Yeah.

3568
02:37:35.44 --> 02:37:36.44
That's true.

3569
02:37:36.44 --> 02:37:39.44
But if you're trying to, and here's the thing, I don't know if we talk about this.

3570
02:37:39.44 --> 02:37:43.44
Where yeah, if you're trying to like build muscle, which I think is a very worthy goal.

3571
02:37:43.44 --> 02:37:46.44
By the way, we are in support of building muscle.

3572
02:37:46.44 --> 02:37:47.44
You want more muscle?

3573
02:37:47.44 --> 02:37:48.44
You want less muscle.

3574
02:37:48.44 --> 02:37:49.44
Right.

3575
02:37:49.44 --> 02:37:50.44
The day not that kind of me.

3576
02:37:50.44 --> 02:37:51.44
What do you call them?

3577
02:37:51.44 --> 02:37:52.44
The simple decision.

3578
02:37:52.44 --> 02:37:53.44
The binary decision.

3579
02:37:53.44 --> 02:37:54.44
By their decision.

3580
02:37:54.44 --> 02:37:55.44
Right.

3581
02:37:55.44 --> 02:37:56.44
One more you want less.

3582
02:37:56.44 --> 02:37:56.44
All right.

3583
02:37:56.44 --> 02:38:01.44
So if you want more, you need extra protein to add to the muscle that you're trying to build.

3584
02:38:01.44 --> 02:38:04.44
So do you know the minimum amount of protein you need?

3585
02:38:04.44 --> 02:38:07.44
One gram per pound of lean body mass.

3586
02:38:07.44 --> 02:38:10.44
Oh, joccal coming off the top row.

3587
02:38:10.44 --> 02:38:12.44
So it's a gross science from 1997.

3588
02:38:12.44 --> 02:38:14.44
From what I understand, that's on the high end.

3589
02:38:14.44 --> 02:38:15.44
For sure.

3590
02:38:15.44 --> 02:38:16.44
Okay.

3591
02:38:16.44 --> 02:38:17.44
Well, but keep in mind.

3592
02:38:17.44 --> 02:38:18.44
Let's round it up.

3593
02:38:18.44 --> 02:38:19.44
All right.

3594
02:38:19.44 --> 02:38:20.44
Well, let's say the average.

3595
02:38:20.44 --> 02:38:21.44
Let's say someone weighs 180 pounds.

3596
02:38:21.44 --> 02:38:22.44
Okay.

3597
02:38:22.44 --> 02:38:25.44
So you need 180 grams of protein.

3598
02:38:25.44 --> 02:38:26.44
You know, much protein.

3599
02:38:26.44 --> 02:38:27.44
That's a lot of protein.

3600
02:38:27.44 --> 02:38:30.44
A lot of steaks in one day.

3601
02:38:30.44 --> 02:38:33.44
And steaks are pretty high in protein, seems same.

3602
02:38:33.44 --> 02:38:35.44
So the milk.

3603
02:38:35.44 --> 02:38:36.44
This serves.

3604
02:38:36.44 --> 02:38:38.44
This serves that purpose very well.

3605
02:38:38.44 --> 02:38:39.44
Here's a good thing about milk.

3606
02:38:39.44 --> 02:38:41.44
Like we already know it actually tastes good.

3607
02:38:41.44 --> 02:38:42.44
Like actual dessert.

3608
02:38:42.44 --> 02:38:46.44
So now you can have two desserts in one day.

3609
02:38:46.44 --> 02:38:48.44
You'll be better off than you were.

3610
02:38:48.44 --> 02:38:50.44
And if you're trying to build muscle boom facility.

3611
02:38:50.44 --> 02:38:54.44
You have breakfast, dessert, lunch, dessert, dinner.

3612
02:38:54.44 --> 02:38:55.44
dessert.

3613
02:38:55.44 --> 02:38:56.44
Snack dessert.

3614
02:38:56.44 --> 02:38:57.44
Get yourself some milk.

3615
02:38:57.44 --> 02:38:58.44

And in LA, we're working across the country.

3625
02:39:21.44 --> 02:39:27.44
We're literally having meetings all the time to get this stuff propagated throughout the nation.

3626
02:39:27.44 --> 02:39:32.44
Because we don't want everyone to be stronger, faster, smarter and better.

3627
02:39:32.44 --> 02:39:33.44
Yeah.

02:39:33.44 --> 02:39:37.44
So we'll let you know as we as we get out there.

3629
02:39:37.44 --> 02:39:40.44

This is where you can get your American made stuff.

3634

A parallel got some boots on there.

3635
02:39:50.44 --> 02:39:51.44
Boots and jeans.

3636
02:39:51.44 --> 02:39:55.44
They say that's the what he called a flagship kind of scenario.

3637
02:39:55.44 --> 02:39:56.44
Yes.

3638
02:39:56.44 --> 02:39:59.44
There's some jiu-jitsu stuff on there.

3639
02:39:59.44 --> 02:40:00.44
Pete was on there.

3640
02:40:00.44 --> 02:40:05.44
He's demonstrating or how should I say displaying, showing whatever some new pants.

3641
02:40:05.44 --> 02:40:06.44
The new work pants.

3642
02:40:06.44 --> 02:40:07.44
Yeah.

3643
02:40:07.44 --> 02:40:08.44
I got them.

3644
02:40:08.44 --> 02:40:10.44
They're freaking legit.

3645
02:40:10.44 --> 02:40:11.44
They're so stoked.

3646
02:40:11.44 --> 02:40:15.44
Brother, there's some, you were talking about wet suits earlier today.

3647
02:40:15.44 --> 02:40:16.44
Yeah.

3648
02:40:16.44 --> 02:40:19.44
And to me, this is kind of the image I got.

3649
02:40:19.44 --> 02:40:23.44
It's like, you were talking about those old wet suits and your new high speed wet suit.

3650
02:40:23.44 --> 02:40:25.44
It's kind of like, yeah.

3651
02:40:25.44 --> 02:40:26.44
Yeah.

3652
02:40:26.44 --> 02:40:29.44
So these pants that Pete Pete was showing.

3653
02:40:29.44 --> 02:40:30.44
There's a little video.

3654
02:40:30.44 --> 02:40:31.44
That's the new work.

3655
02:40:31.44 --> 02:40:32.44
Yeah.

3656
02:40:32.44 --> 02:40:34.44
So it's like, oh, if you get regular work pants, cool.

3657
02:40:34.44 --> 02:40:37.44
It's better to know it's actually not.

3658
02:40:37.44 --> 02:40:39.44
It's like having one of those old wet suits.

3659
02:40:39.44 --> 02:40:40.44
Yeah.

3660
02:40:40.44 --> 02:40:41.44
But it's better to get no wet suit.

3661
02:40:41.44 --> 02:40:42.44
It's what I'm saying.

3662
02:40:42.44 --> 02:40:43.44
Marginally.

3663
02:40:43.44 --> 02:40:44.44
And that's what I'm saying.

3664
02:40:44.44 --> 02:40:45.44
And there's no reason to.

3665
02:40:45.44 --> 02:40:48.44
It's not like there's going to be, you know, there's no reason to.

3666
02:40:48.44 --> 02:40:52.44
Back in the day, it was, hey, this is the cheapest government contractor that can build

3667
02:40:52.44 --> 02:40:56.44
us wet suits that suck.

3668
02:40:56.44 --> 02:40:59.44
And then other manufacturers are out there making badass wet suits.

3669
02:40:59.44 --> 02:41:00.44
But we didn't get them yet.

3670
02:41:00.44 --> 02:41:01.44
So there's no reason for that.

3671
02:41:01.44 --> 02:41:02.44
Oh, yeah.

3672
02:41:02.44 --> 02:41:03.44
So now you got the same deal.

3673
02:41:03.44 --> 02:41:04.44
Boom.

3674
02:41:04.44 --> 02:41:08.44
You want to knew the updated effective work pants.

3675
02:41:08.44 --> 02:41:11.44
This is the kind of stuff origin does straight.

3676
02:41:11.44 --> 02:41:12.44
That's the game.

3677
02:41:12.44 --> 02:41:14.44
We're going to make everything by the way.

3678
02:41:14.44 --> 02:41:15.44
Everything.

3679
02:41:15.44 --> 02:41:17.44
Also make guise.

3680
02:41:17.44 --> 02:41:22.44
And hey, if you want to put your ghee to the test, come to the origin.

3681
02:41:22.44 --> 02:41:27.44
Main, jiu-jitsu camp retreat intensive.

3682
02:41:27.44 --> 02:41:28.44
Immersion.

3683
02:41:28.44 --> 02:41:29.44
Yeah.

3684
02:41:29.44 --> 02:41:30.44
Immersion camp.

3685
02:41:30.44 --> 02:41:31.44
That too.

3686
02:41:31.44 --> 02:41:32.44
And here's the thing about that too.

3687
02:41:32.44 --> 02:41:35.44
Because sometimes people will be like, oh, is that, is that thing just super intense?

3688
02:41:35.44 --> 02:41:37.44
It's like a lot of this is like freaking fun.

3689
02:41:37.44 --> 02:41:38.44
What's up?

3690
02:41:38.44 --> 02:41:40.44
Like three, do you just did three times, two times, whatever.

3691
02:41:40.44 --> 02:41:52.44
And then they're like, man, like I like jiu-jitsu, but I don't know if I'm down for these, you know, this hell week maybe seal 30% of the people that are there will have less experience in jiu-jitsu than you.

3692
02:41:52.44 --> 02:41:55.44
Even if you only have two weeks of jiu-jitsu.

3693
02:41:55.44 --> 02:41:56.44
Yeah.

3694
02:41:56.44 --> 02:42:00.44
And I'd be some freaking awesome badass black belt and brown belt and purple belts for sure.

3695
02:42:00.44 --> 02:42:03.44
But there'll be a lot of people that are just getting their start in jiu-jitsu.

3696
02:42:03.44 --> 02:42:06.44
So come and check that out if you want to origin.

3697
02:42:06.44 --> 02:42:07.44
Check origin usay.com.

3698
02:42:07.44 --> 02:42:08.44
Yeah.

3699
02:42:08.44 --> 02:42:11.44
And it's not like it's this big competition training all the time.

3700
02:42:11.44 --> 02:42:13.44
I'm not going to name any names.

3701
02:42:13.44 --> 02:42:15.44
And actually it's cool.

3702
02:42:15.44 --> 02:42:19.44
You can go there and not, not spar with people.

3703
02:42:19.44 --> 02:42:21.44
Go there, just learn learn the technique.

3704
02:42:21.44 --> 02:42:22.44
Talk with some people.

3705
02:42:22.44 --> 02:42:24.44
Go swim in the lake.

3706
02:42:24.44 --> 02:42:25.44
Straight up.

3707
02:42:25.44 --> 02:42:26.44
Like it's a jiu-jitsu vacation.

3708
02:42:26.44 --> 02:42:27.44
This is what it is straight up.

3709
02:42:27.44 --> 02:42:29.44
We should have called it a jiu-jitsu vacation.

3710
02:42:29.44 --> 02:42:30.44
Yeah.

3711
02:42:30.44 --> 02:42:30.44
Yeah.

3712
02:42:30.44 --> 02:42:34.44
And you can even call it a va- depending on your intent going there.

3713
02:42:34.44 --> 02:42:37.44
You could call it a vacation with some level of jiu-jitsu depending on what you're going to do.

3714
02:42:37.44 --> 02:42:38.44
You can go level 10.

3715
02:42:38.44 --> 02:42:39.44
Yeah.

3716
02:42:39.44 --> 02:42:40.44
You can train three times a day.

3717
02:42:40.44 --> 02:42:41.44
You can train.

3718
02:42:41.44 --> 02:42:43.44
You could train probably 14 hours a day if you want to.

3719
02:42:43.44 --> 02:42:45.44
And you could train zero.

3720
02:42:45.44 --> 02:42:46.44
It's up to you.

3721
02:42:46.44 --> 02:42:52.44
It's just kind of a vacation with some level of jiu-jitsu involved if you want.

3722
02:42:52.44 --> 02:42:58.44
And lobster and lobster and steak.

3723
02:42:58.44 --> 02:42:59.44
So jing it out.

3724
02:42:59.44 --> 02:43:00.44
Origin usay.com.

3725
02:43:00.44 --> 02:43:01.44
Also we have a store.

3726
02:43:01.44 --> 02:43:02.44
By the way.

3727
02:43:02.44 --> 02:43:03.44
Yes.

3728
02:43:03.44 --> 02:43:04.44
What's that store called?

3729
02:43:04.44 --> 02:43:05.44
Let's go.

3730
02:43:05.44 --> 02:43:06.44
Jiu-jitsu store.

3731
02:43:06.44 --> 02:43:10.44
Jiu-jitsu store.com is where you can eat your shirts and hats and hoodies.

3732
02:43:10.44 --> 02:43:12.44
Light and heavy.

3733
02:43:12.44 --> 02:43:13.44
Rash guards on there.

3734
02:43:13.44 --> 02:43:14.44
Some shorts on there.

3735
02:43:14.44 --> 02:43:16.44
I'm going to update some shorts.

3736
02:43:16.44 --> 02:43:18.44
Get some new shorts on there too.

3737
02:43:18.44 --> 02:43:20.44
Are the ones that I've been asking for?

3738
02:43:20.44 --> 02:43:21.44
Yes.

3739
02:43:21.44 --> 02:43:22.44
Okay.

3740
02:43:22.44 --> 02:43:23.44
That's good to know.

3741
02:43:23.44 --> 02:43:24.44
As soon as those come out, I need five pairs.

3742
02:43:24.44 --> 02:43:25.44
Okay.

3743
02:43:25.44 --> 02:43:26.44
Just kind of FYI.

3744
02:43:26.44 --> 02:43:27.44
You've got to.

3745
02:43:27.44 --> 02:43:28.44
Just kind of FYI.

3746
02:43:28.44 --> 02:43:29.44
100%.

3747
02:43:29.44 --> 02:43:30.44
So there's a lot of cool stuff on there.

3748
02:43:30.44 --> 02:43:31.44
Disable and equals freedom.

3749
02:43:31.44 --> 02:43:32.44
Good.

3750
02:43:32.44 --> 02:43:33.44
When you want to represent all your other path.

3751
02:43:33.44 --> 02:43:34.44
This is what you're going to do.

3752
02:43:34.44 --> 02:43:37.44
You see the same material as the old shorts.

3753
02:43:37.44 --> 02:43:38.44
You tell me.

3754
02:43:38.44 --> 02:43:40.44
I say yes because they have materials.

3755
02:43:40.44 --> 02:43:41.44
Good.

3756
02:43:41.44 --> 02:43:42.44
Yes sir.

3757
02:43:42.44 --> 02:43:43.44
I agree.

3758
02:43:43.44 --> 02:43:44.44
Yes.

3759
02:43:44.44 --> 02:43:46.44
Some shorts on there as well.

3760
02:43:46.44 --> 02:43:47.44
If you want something, get something.

3761
02:43:47.44 --> 02:43:49.44
That's a good way to represent.

3762
02:43:49.44 --> 02:43:52.44
Also, we have the shirt locker.

3763
02:43:52.44 --> 02:43:53.44
The new shirt.

3764
02:43:53.44 --> 02:43:54.44
It's a subscription situation.

3765
02:43:54.44 --> 02:43:55.44
New shirt every single month.

3766
02:43:55.44 --> 02:43:56.44
Different designs.

3767
02:43:56.44 --> 02:43:59.44
Not as good design.

3768
02:43:59.44 --> 02:44:00.44
You're hired.

3769
02:44:00.44 --> 02:44:01.44
Hey, look.

3770
02:44:01.44 --> 02:44:02.44
For sure.

3771
02:44:02.44 --> 02:44:03.44
That was a great experience.

3772
02:44:03.44 --> 02:44:11.44
We collectively have been struggling to demonstrate or to explain the quality of these new designs.

3773
02:44:11.44 --> 02:44:13.44
You say we got some cool designs.

3774
02:44:13.44 --> 02:44:14.44
We do.

3775
02:44:14.44 --> 02:44:15.44
You could have said that.

3776
02:44:15.44 --> 02:44:16.44
Yeah.

3777
02:44:16.44 --> 02:44:17.44
Well said.

3778
02:44:17.44 --> 02:44:18.44
You said there.

3779
02:44:18.44 --> 02:44:19.44
But that doesn't.

3780
02:44:19.44 --> 02:44:20.44
That doesn't capture.

3781
02:44:20.44 --> 02:44:22.44
Because every time people are like, hey, that design is cool.

3782
02:44:22.44 --> 02:44:23.44
Can I have it?

3783
02:44:23.44 --> 02:44:25.44
And I'm going to be like, well, that was two months ago.

3784
02:44:25.44 --> 02:44:26.44
Okay.

3785
02:44:26.44 --> 02:44:26.44
Same saying.

3786
02:44:26.44 --> 02:44:27.44
So I got to convey it accurately.

3787
02:44:27.44 --> 02:44:28.44
So people know going in.

3788
02:44:28.44 --> 02:44:29.44
It's an element of trust.

3789
02:44:29.44 --> 02:44:30.44
For sure.

3790
02:44:30.44 --> 02:44:31.44
But sure.

3791
02:44:31.44 --> 02:44:32.44
Check it out.

3792
02:44:32.44 --> 02:44:32.44
The shirt locker.

3793
02:44:32.44 --> 02:44:33.44
Yeah.

3794
02:44:33.44 --> 02:44:34.44
So I'm John Kustor.

3795
02:44:34.44 --> 02:44:36.44
Hey, also subscribe to this podcast.

3796
02:44:36.44 --> 02:44:37.44
Don't forget we have some other podcast.

3797
02:44:37.44 --> 02:44:39.44
We got Jockel on Ravling with Darryl Cooper.

3798
02:44:39.44 --> 02:44:43.44
We got the grounded podcast, which we haven't done the long run.

3799
02:44:43.44 --> 02:44:45.44
We got the Warrior Kid podcast.

3800
02:44:45.44 --> 02:44:47.44
And we also have the Jockel Underground podcast.

3801
02:44:47.44 --> 02:44:48.44
Jockel Underground.com.

3802
02:44:48.44 --> 02:44:54.44
If you want to subscribe to that thing and get on board and help us build the underground.

3803
02:44:54.44 --> 02:44:57.44
Where we're going to be laying and waiting things.

3804
02:44:57.44 --> 02:44:59.44
If things go sideways, we'll be there.

3805
02:44:59.44 --> 02:45:02.44
We stockpiling material.

3806
02:45:02.44 --> 02:45:03.44
Sure.

3807
02:45:03.44 --> 02:45:04.44
We got food.

3808
02:45:04.44 --> 02:45:05.44
We got water.

3809
02:45:05.44 --> 02:45:07.44
We got content.

3810
02:45:07.44 --> 02:45:09.44
Jockel Underground.com.

3811
02:45:09.44 --> 02:45:10.44
If you want to check out out.

3812
02:45:10.44 --> 02:45:12.44
$8.18 a month.

3813
02:45:12.44 --> 02:45:16.44
Some people know what that $8.18 cents represents.

3814
02:45:16.44 --> 02:45:17.44
Not many though.

3815
02:45:17.44 --> 02:45:19.44
Take a guess.

3816
02:45:19.44 --> 02:45:22.44
And if you can't afford it, look, we want you in the game.

3817
02:45:22.44 --> 02:45:25.44
Even if you can't afford that $8.18 a month.

3818
02:45:25.44 --> 02:45:28.44
We'll still just email assistance at Jockel.

3819
02:45:28.44 --> 02:45:31.44
And we'll take care of that.

3820
02:45:31.44 --> 02:45:39.44
Also, we have a YouTube channel where a lot of the videos, some of the videos, I should say,

3821
02:45:39.44 --> 02:45:42.44
some of the more premier videos have, I'm the assistant director on.

3822
02:45:42.44 --> 02:45:44.44
And it's very obvious when they're awesome.

3823
02:45:44.44 --> 02:45:45.44
You know, funny.

3824
02:45:45.44 --> 02:45:48.44
They released a video recently.

3825
02:45:48.44 --> 02:45:49.44
Mango, man.

3826
02:45:49.44 --> 02:45:50.44
Mango, man.

3827
02:45:50.44 --> 02:45:51.44
I don't do it.

3828
02:45:51.44 --> 02:45:56.44
So people are catching on to the whole assistant director thing.

3829
02:45:56.44 --> 02:45:58.44
Why is that like that?

3830
02:45:58.44 --> 02:46:02.44
Because, well, because people, I think,

3831
02:46:02.44 --> 02:46:04.44
might give you, well, I don't think it.

3832
02:46:04.44 --> 02:46:06.44
And I guess it's not undue credit.

3833
02:46:06.44 --> 02:46:09.44
Because the author, I know you say this kind of a joke.

3834
02:46:09.44 --> 02:46:15.44
But like, everyone's in all, you'll add like a little detail.

3835
02:46:15.44 --> 02:46:17.44
I had a critical detail.

3836
02:46:17.44 --> 02:46:19.44
That turns out to be kind of critical.

3837
02:46:19.44 --> 02:46:20.44
So, okay.

3838
02:46:20.44 --> 02:46:22.44
So, in that video, it hurts you so bad.

3839
02:46:22.44 --> 02:46:25.44
It hurts you so bad that whatever I add is usually critical.

3840
02:46:25.44 --> 02:46:26.44
Okay.

3841
02:46:26.44 --> 02:46:27.44
So, here's the thing.

3842
02:46:27.44 --> 02:46:29.44
You're right in a way.

3843
02:46:29.44 --> 02:46:31.44
It doesn't hurt.

3844
02:46:31.44 --> 02:46:32.44
Okay.

3845
02:46:32.44 --> 02:46:33.44
We'll use the word.

3846
02:46:33.44 --> 02:46:34.44
It hurts me.

3847
02:46:34.44 --> 02:46:36.44
Not because, oh, Jocco did it.

3848
02:46:36.44 --> 02:46:37.44
Thought of it night.

3849
02:46:37.44 --> 02:46:38.44
Didn't.

3850
02:46:38.44 --> 02:46:39.44
It's more that.

3851
02:46:39.44 --> 02:46:40.44
Jocco thought of it.

3852
02:46:40.44 --> 02:46:41.44
I don't know you.

3853
02:46:41.44 --> 02:46:44.44
It's hard to do.

3854
02:46:44.44 --> 02:46:45.44
It's hard to do.

3855
02:46:45.44 --> 02:46:48.44
That means like if I was writing a book about leadership.

3856
02:46:48.44 --> 02:46:49.44
And then you added it.

3857
02:46:49.44 --> 02:46:52.44
You were like, hey, you need to discuss this thing right here.

3858
02:46:52.44 --> 02:46:55.44
And I couldn't not do it because it made so much sense.

3859
02:46:55.44 --> 02:46:56.44
I know.

3860
02:46:56.44 --> 02:46:59.44
And you know what, my ego would be affected by that.

3861
02:46:59.44 --> 02:47:00.44
That's okay.

3862
02:47:00.44 --> 02:47:01.44
So that's where you're at.

3863
02:47:01.44 --> 02:47:02.44
That's the part.

3864
02:47:02.44 --> 02:47:05.44
I like, well, maybe it is, but I don't feel overtly that it's my ego.

3865
02:47:05.44 --> 02:47:07.44
It's more that like, oh, shoot.

3866
02:47:07.44 --> 02:47:08.44
I didn't even see that.

3867
02:47:08.44 --> 02:47:10.44
Like, how can I be so stupid?

3868
02:47:10.44 --> 02:47:11.44
How can I be so stupid?

3869
02:47:11.44 --> 02:47:17.44
How can I be so pathetic and not know how can I not be better?

3870
02:47:17.44 --> 02:47:18.44
Better.

3871
02:47:18.44 --> 02:47:19.44
Not a good person.

3872
02:47:19.44 --> 02:47:23.44
You're like, you're, you walked up like in that video.

3873
02:47:23.44 --> 02:47:24.44
You walked up right at the beginning.

3874
02:47:24.44 --> 02:47:26.44
When you walked up and you're doing this, this part.

3875
02:47:26.44 --> 02:47:27.44
Yep.

3876
02:47:27.44 --> 02:47:28.44
Like that.

3877
02:47:28.44 --> 02:47:29.44
That's pretty good.

3878
02:47:29.44 --> 02:47:30.44
I've got to give it to you.

3879
02:47:30.44 --> 02:47:31.44
I'll end it to you.

3880
02:47:31.44 --> 02:47:32.44
Assistant Director Junk over here.

3881
02:47:32.44 --> 02:47:34.44
So I have YouTube channel.

3882
02:47:34.44 --> 02:47:35.44
You can subscribe to that.

3883
02:47:35.44 --> 02:47:39.44
And we also have an album that's called Psychological Warfare that will help you get

3884
02:47:39.44 --> 02:47:42.44
little moments, get through little moments of a weakness.

3885
02:47:42.44 --> 02:47:44.44
I'll kind of get in your head a little bit.

3886
02:47:44.44 --> 02:47:45.44
Press play.

3887
02:47:45.44 --> 02:47:48.44
Go your MP3 platforms to get some of that.

3888
02:47:48.44 --> 02:47:52.44
If you need a visual representation of the path, cool.

3889
02:47:52.44 --> 02:47:53.44
We got that for you too.

3890
02:47:53.44 --> 02:47:56.44
Well, Dakota Meyer does flipsidecampus.com.

3891
02:47:56.44 --> 02:47:58.44
Got all kinds of cool stuff to hang on your wall.

3892
02:47:58.44 --> 02:48:00.44
I've written a bunch of books.

3893
02:48:00.44 --> 02:48:02.44
The the the latest edition.

3894
02:48:02.44 --> 02:48:04.44
Oh, I can't have it on my table.

3895
02:48:04.44 --> 02:48:05.44
Final spin.

3896
02:48:05.44 --> 02:48:09.44
It's a book.

3897
02:48:09.44 --> 02:48:11.44
I mean, it's hard to describe.

3898
02:48:11.44 --> 02:48:12.44
It's a transcript.

3899
02:48:12.44 --> 02:48:14.44
It's, it's a novel.

3900
02:48:14.44 --> 02:48:15.44
It's a poem.

3901
02:48:15.44 --> 02:48:17.44
We don't even, the publisher doesn't know what's called.

3902
02:48:17.44 --> 02:48:18.44
They never seen anything like it.

3903
02:48:18.44 --> 02:48:22.44
All they know is that it, they, they are impressed.

3904
02:48:22.44 --> 02:48:27.44
All they know is that they are emotionally moved by this piece of work.

3905
02:48:27.44 --> 02:48:32.44
So if you want to get some of that order now, final spin, get that first edition.

3906
02:48:32.44 --> 02:48:34.44
You're going to want the first edition that.

3907
02:48:34.44 --> 02:48:36.44
Because listen, hey, I'm going to write another leadership book.

3908
02:48:36.44 --> 02:48:37.44
But guess what?

3909
02:48:37.44 --> 02:48:38.44
