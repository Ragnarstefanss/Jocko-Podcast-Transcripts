00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
This is Jockel Podcast number 312.

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.50
With echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink.

3
00:00:06.50 --> 00:00:07.50
Good evening, echo.

4
00:00:07.50 --> 00:00:08.000
Good evening.

5
00:00:11.50 --> 00:00:14.20
Something slammed into my helicopter.

6
00:00:14.20 --> 00:00:17.20
We didn't know what it was or where it had impacted,

7
00:00:17.20 --> 00:00:20.30
but the heelow bucked hard, like a small sports car

8
00:00:20.30 --> 00:00:22.000
going over a large speed bump.

9
00:00:23.10 --> 00:00:25.80
We'd been passing by the Olympic hotel for the third time

10
00:00:25.80 --> 00:00:27.80
doing 50 knots at about 75 feet

11
00:00:27.80 --> 00:00:31.30
when an RPG round rocketed into the tail section.

12
00:00:32.60 --> 00:00:35.30
But that was 35 feet behind me.

13
00:00:35.30 --> 00:00:38.80
The aircraft was 18,000 pounds of metal muscle

14
00:00:38.80 --> 00:00:40.60
then it certainly wasn't coming apart.

15
00:00:41.60 --> 00:00:42.70
At least not yet.

16
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.000
I looked quietly.

17
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.70
I looked quickly around the cockpit

18
00:00:46.70 --> 00:00:48.000
while Ray did the same.

19
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Both of us testing the controls and checking the gauges.

20
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.10
Everything was in the green.

21
00:00:54.10 --> 00:00:57.000
No flight control problems, engine malfunctions

22
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.20
or weird noises.

23
00:00:59.40 --> 00:01:01.000
No one in my bird said a word.

24
00:01:02.10 --> 00:01:05.40
And then super six four year hit bad.

25
00:01:06.20 --> 00:01:08.40
It was Matthews up in the C2 bird.

26
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.20
You better put it on the ground.

27
00:01:11.20 --> 00:01:13.000
From his position high over the battle,

28
00:01:13.20 --> 00:01:16.000
he had seen the rocket impact just below my tail

29
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
raking pieces away and pin wheels as it detonated.

30
00:01:19.90 --> 00:01:22.40
No shit, I thought as I rolled out of the turn.

31
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.80
Just ahead, maybe a mile off was what appeared to be

32
00:01:25.80 --> 00:01:29.000
a clear area, certainly large enough to land a black hawk.

33
00:01:29.80 --> 00:01:32.40
But the aircraft seemed to be flying normally

34
00:01:32.40 --> 00:01:34.40
and I was facing the decision to crash in the middle

35
00:01:34.40 --> 00:01:37.60
of a firefight or fly just two more miles

36
00:01:37.60 --> 00:01:39.000
to the safety of the airfield.

37
00:01:39.80 --> 00:01:41.80
I didn't hesitate or discuss it with anyone.

38
00:01:41.80 --> 00:01:43.20
It was my decision to make.

39
00:01:43.20 --> 00:01:44.40
We'd go for the field.

40
00:01:45.20 --> 00:01:48.000
Still, I kept my eye on that midway point.

41
00:01:48.20 --> 00:01:49.80
It sort of looked like a city park

42
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.20
which was what it had been long ago

43
00:01:52.20 --> 00:01:53.80
when the place was prosperous.

44
00:01:53.80 --> 00:01:55.60
Now as we closed on it,

45
00:01:55.60 --> 00:01:58.40
I could see that it was covered with tin shacks and huts.

46
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.40
But none of that mattered

47
00:02:00.60 --> 00:02:02.20
because within a few seconds,

48
00:02:02.20 --> 00:02:04.40
the world went completely to hell.

49
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.80
The RPG had smashed into the rear gear box

50
00:02:08.80 --> 00:02:10.80
a fixture the size of a big watermelon

51
00:02:10.80 --> 00:02:12.80
and full of oil and gears

52
00:02:12.80 --> 00:02:15.60
where the drive shaft came in to have its speed

53
00:02:15.60 --> 00:02:18.40
and direction ratios altered for the tail rotor.

54
00:02:19.20 --> 00:02:21.40
The bottom of that box had been blown off

55
00:02:21.40 --> 00:02:24.20
the drive shaft bent and twisted.

56
00:02:25.20 --> 00:02:28.000
I heard a rapidly accelerating wine

57
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.40
and unearthly building scream

58
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.40
and then the tail rotor assembly

59
00:02:33.40 --> 00:02:35.60
completely disintegrated into vapor

60
00:02:35.60 --> 00:02:37.40
with an ear splitting bang.

61
00:02:39.20 --> 00:02:41.40
The nose of the helicopter immediately started to spin

62
00:02:41.40 --> 00:02:43.40
to the right, the tail rotor on a blackhawk

63
00:02:43.40 --> 00:02:46.20
counters the torque created by the main rotor system

64
00:02:46.20 --> 00:02:49.40
and the pedal pedals control the pitch of the tail rotor.

65
00:02:49.40 --> 00:02:53.000
As we passed through the first 90 degrees of rotation,

66
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.40
I instinctively countered with the left pedal

67
00:02:56.40 --> 00:02:57.60
and I knew we'd lost it.

68
00:02:59.20 --> 00:03:00.80
I'll never forget looking down to make sure

69
00:03:00.80 --> 00:03:02.000
I was pushing the pedal

70
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.80
and seeing my boot jammed all the way to the floor.

71
00:03:06.20 --> 00:03:08.000
My body was reacting properly

72
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.60
but my yellow was not.

73
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.80
I keyed the mic.

74
00:03:12.40 --> 00:03:13.80
Six fours lost the tail rotor,

75
00:03:13.80 --> 00:03:15.000
we're going in hard.

76
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.40
I looked over it, ray and said,

77
00:03:17.40 --> 00:03:19.20
I guess we better pull them off.

78
00:03:19.80 --> 00:03:21.40
I was referring to the engines

79
00:03:21.40 --> 00:03:23.20
because the only way to counter that spin

80
00:03:23.20 --> 00:03:25.60
was to shut them down and eliminate the torque.

81
00:03:26.20 --> 00:03:29.60
But just as the blackhawk manual describes such an emergency

82
00:03:29.60 --> 00:03:32.000
if you don't kill the engines right away,

83
00:03:32.20 --> 00:03:34.60
the force will make it physically impossible

84
00:03:34.60 --> 00:03:37.60
to reach up for the power control levers.

85
00:03:38.60 --> 00:03:41.000
I'd always thought that sounded a little extreme.

86
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.20
It wasn't super six fours started to spin so fast

87
00:03:46.20 --> 00:03:48.40
that the sky and ground became nothing

88
00:03:48.40 --> 00:03:50.80
but two blurred stripes of blue and brown

89
00:03:50.80 --> 00:03:51.80
in front of my eyes.

90
00:03:52.60 --> 00:03:54.20
It was like riding a merry-go-round

91
00:03:54.20 --> 00:03:56.40
looking straight out from the side of your horse

92
00:03:56.40 --> 00:03:58.60
while the teenage operator goes nuts

93
00:03:58.60 --> 00:04:00.80
and halls it up to 50 revs per minute.

94
00:04:01.80 --> 00:04:03.60
I was hurled against my harness,

95
00:04:03.60 --> 00:04:06.80
my hands desperately yanking and twisting the controls

96
00:04:06.80 --> 00:04:07.84
and I looked over it,

97
00:04:07.84 --> 00:04:10.40
ray, to see him fighting the force with every muscle,

98
00:04:10.40 --> 00:04:12.000
his glove hands quaking

99
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.000
as he tried to reach up for the power levels.

100
00:04:17.40 --> 00:04:19.60
I knew I was going to die.

101
00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.40
And that right there is an excerpt from the book

102
00:04:28.40 --> 00:04:31.60
called in the company of Heroes,

103
00:04:31.60 --> 00:04:33.20
which was written by retired chief

104
00:04:33.20 --> 00:04:35.60
worn officer Michael J. Durant,

105
00:04:36.60 --> 00:04:40.60
who was a member of the legendary Knight Stockers

106
00:04:40.60 --> 00:04:45.000
and who was shot down during Operation Gothic Serpent

107
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.60
and was held captive during the battle of Mogadishu.

108
00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.60
That operation was documented in the book Black Hawk Down

109
00:04:54.60 --> 00:04:57.20
by author Mark Bowden

110
00:04:57.20 --> 00:05:00.80
and the book was eventually adapted into the movie Black Hawk Down.

111
00:05:02.60 --> 00:05:06.40
But it is an honor tonight to have Mike Durant

112
00:05:06.40 --> 00:05:10.000
with us to discuss his lessons learned,

113
00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
his experiences from the army,

114
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.60
from the Knight Stockers, from Somalia and beyond.

115
00:05:16.60 --> 00:05:19.20
Mike, thank you for joining us.

116
00:05:19.20 --> 00:05:21.000
My pleasure, Jaco. Good to be here.

117
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.40
It's a rough way to start off this podcast,

118
00:05:23.40 --> 00:05:26.80
I guess, putting you through those moments.

119
00:05:26.80 --> 00:05:28.000
Yeah, you know, it's interesting

120
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.80
that I wrote the book over 10 years ago

121
00:05:29.80 --> 00:05:34.40
and I tried to go back and read it again a couple years back

122
00:05:34.40 --> 00:05:37.000
and honestly, I just don't want to relive it.

123
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.80
So it is kind of hard sometimes

124
00:05:39.80 --> 00:05:42.000
because those were pretty rough times,

125
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.40
but I'm glad we got it all down on paper

126
00:05:44.40 --> 00:05:46.40
and you know, it's certainly a story worth telling.

127
00:05:47.60 --> 00:05:50.20
All right, so I like to start at the beginning.

128
00:05:50.20 --> 00:05:53.80
So we're going to jump into a little bit of the childhood

129
00:05:53.80 --> 00:05:57.20
where you came from, how you ended up being you.

130
00:05:57.20 --> 00:05:59.000
You're saying the book as far back as I can remember,

131
00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.40
I always wanted to be a helicopter pilot.

132
00:06:01.40 --> 00:06:03.90
Sure, other James Flash by when you're a kid

133
00:06:03.90 --> 00:06:06.60
in a small New England town, fire fighter, police men,

134
00:06:06.60 --> 00:06:09.40
sports hero, brain surgeon.

135
00:06:09.40 --> 00:06:10.60
I never had the brain surgeon one.

136
00:06:10.60 --> 00:06:11.80
Yeah, I think we made that up.

137
00:06:11.80 --> 00:06:13.40
I don't think I ever thought that.

138
00:06:13.40 --> 00:06:15.000
But the idea of flying for a living

139
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.80
had always enthralled me the most.

140
00:06:16.80 --> 00:06:18.60
My father was a full-time first surgeon

141
00:06:18.60 --> 00:06:20.80
in the Army National Guard and many of my uncles

142
00:06:20.80 --> 00:06:22.80
and cousin served there as well, but I didn't have

143
00:06:22.80 --> 00:06:25.000
fancies about flying off into battle

144
00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.80
and coming home here with a chest full of metals.

145
00:06:27.80 --> 00:06:31.20
I grew up during the Vietnam era when none of the kids

146
00:06:31.20 --> 00:06:34.000
around me wanted anything to do with wearing a uniform.

147
00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.80
So it wasn't about patriotism or flag waving

148
00:06:36.80 --> 00:06:37.80
or anything like that.

149
00:06:37.80 --> 00:06:40.40
My feelings about duty, honor and country

150
00:06:40.40 --> 00:06:42.20
would evolve over time.

151
00:06:42.20 --> 00:06:44.40
But back then, the Army was just a way for me

152
00:06:44.40 --> 00:06:48.60
to get the best flight training without having to pay for it.

153
00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.60
I got to ask this question the other day.

154
00:06:51.60 --> 00:06:53.80
I was on the special operations now,

155
00:06:53.80 --> 00:06:55.80
has their own podcast.

156
00:06:55.80 --> 00:06:59.000
And they asked me, they set me up with this really nice question.

157
00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.80
You know, can you tell us about when you realized

158
00:07:00.80 --> 00:07:04.40
that service was going to be a part of your life

159
00:07:04.40 --> 00:07:08.40
and you wanting to be recognized that you want to be something bigger

160
00:07:08.40 --> 00:07:09.20
than yourself.

161
00:07:09.20 --> 00:07:12.20
I was like, hey, I appreciate you thinking I was like that

162
00:07:12.20 --> 00:07:15.000
when I was 17 years old, but I just wanted a machine gun.

163
00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.60
Right.

164
00:07:16.60 --> 00:07:17.40
It's the same thing.

165
00:07:17.40 --> 00:07:19.40
You know, I just, I just tell like it is.

166
00:07:19.40 --> 00:07:20.60
That's just that's the reality.

167
00:07:20.60 --> 00:07:25.40
It was, you know, we're in a paper mill town

168
00:07:25.40 --> 00:07:27.20
and nothing is folks who work in the mill,

169
00:07:27.20 --> 00:07:28.000
but that's it.

170
00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.70
I mean, you either, you're going to go have a career

171
00:07:29.70 --> 00:07:32.20
working in the mill or you got to go find something somewhere else.

172
00:07:32.20 --> 00:07:35.20
And when I found out the Army had a helicopter program

173
00:07:35.20 --> 00:07:37.50
and I could sign up and get trained to do it,

174
00:07:37.50 --> 00:07:38.50
I'm like, that's me.

175
00:07:38.50 --> 00:07:41.40
And fortune of one that, you know, one of the guys

176
00:07:41.40 --> 00:07:42.50
that it worked out for.

177
00:07:42.50 --> 00:07:43.80
Yeah.

178
00:07:43.80 --> 00:07:46.50
You say I was barely 17 when I sneaked off to a briefing

179
00:07:46.50 --> 00:07:48.70
at the local recruiting office.

180
00:07:48.70 --> 00:07:50.50
The Army sales pitch was slick.

181
00:07:50.50 --> 00:07:52.90
I'd be attending all of these advanced and top secret

182
00:07:52.90 --> 00:07:56.000
training schools and have all sorts of incredible adventures.

183
00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.50
And I swallowed it, hook, line, and sinker.

184
00:07:58.50 --> 00:08:01.50
I wanted to get into flight school right away,

185
00:08:01.50 --> 00:08:03.70
but the recruiter told me that was not possible.

186
00:08:03.70 --> 00:08:05.70
I would have to join up and then apply for flight school

187
00:08:05.70 --> 00:08:06.90
while in service.

188
00:08:06.90 --> 00:08:08.30
Still my test scores were pretty high.

189
00:08:08.30 --> 00:08:10.90
And I was confident that I eventually would make it.

190
00:08:10.90 --> 00:08:12.30
College is not an option for me.

191
00:08:12.30 --> 00:08:13.90
I only wanted to fly.

192
00:08:13.90 --> 00:08:20.000
And I signed that commitment paper on October 25th, 1978.

193
00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.50
So you did that your junior year?

194
00:08:22.50 --> 00:08:23.10
Let's see.

195
00:08:23.10 --> 00:08:25.70
So that would have been the fall of my senior year.

196
00:08:25.70 --> 00:08:26.20
OK.

197
00:08:26.20 --> 00:08:27.70
Yeah.

198
00:08:27.70 --> 00:08:30.70
A year later, shortly after my graduation

199
00:08:30.70 --> 00:08:33.10
in high school, I found myself in basic training.

200
00:08:33.10 --> 00:08:36.30
So you go to basic training.

201
00:08:36.30 --> 00:08:37.30
How's that?

202
00:08:37.30 --> 00:08:38.30
Yeah.

203
00:08:38.30 --> 00:08:39.70
All those wonderful adventures.

204
00:08:39.70 --> 00:08:43.30
So I'll quickly become reality.

205
00:08:43.30 --> 00:08:50.50
Now I think it, for me, having grown up the way I did,

206
00:08:50.50 --> 00:08:51.50
it was a shock.

207
00:08:51.50 --> 00:08:52.30
I mean, it really was.

208
00:08:52.30 --> 00:08:54.000
Now basic training, looking back now,

209
00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.90
compared to a lot of the other stuff that went on through my career,

210
00:08:56.90 --> 00:08:57.90
was probably nothing.

211
00:08:57.90 --> 00:09:01.10
But for a kid who didn't do a whole lot,

212
00:09:01.10 --> 00:09:03.10
had a couple of fairly easy jobs.

213
00:09:03.10 --> 00:09:07.50
And it was a dramatic change of lifestyle.

214
00:09:07.50 --> 00:09:10.10
What sports did you play growing up in New Hampshire?

215
00:09:10.10 --> 00:09:11.60
Actually, mostly hockey.

216
00:09:11.60 --> 00:09:13.000
I played a little football.

217
00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.30
I was horrible at baseball.

218
00:09:14.30 --> 00:09:17.90
I still can't throw baseball out of no what the problem is.

219
00:09:17.90 --> 00:09:20.20
And then a lot of outdoor activity skiing,

220
00:09:20.20 --> 00:09:21.70
a lot of snow skiing actually.

221
00:09:21.70 --> 00:09:23.50
My dad was a big hunter in Fisherman.

222
00:09:23.50 --> 00:09:25.70
So we did a lot of that.

223
00:09:25.70 --> 00:09:27.90
His job other than being a national guard,

224
00:09:27.90 --> 00:09:30.90
he actually was a surveyor for a forestry company.

225
00:09:30.90 --> 00:09:32.50
So he got out in the woods all the time.

226
00:09:32.50 --> 00:09:34.40
And for him, that was his dream job.

227
00:09:34.40 --> 00:09:35.90
Because he's a hunter.

228
00:09:35.90 --> 00:09:38.10
So now he can go recall where he's going to go hunting,

229
00:09:38.10 --> 00:09:40.50
while he's getting paid to work for the paper company.

230
00:09:40.50 --> 00:09:43.000
So it was a win-win for him.

231
00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.70
But the end result was a lot of time outdoors

232
00:09:45.70 --> 00:09:47.50
and awesome place to grow up.

233
00:09:47.50 --> 00:09:51.40
But northern New England is just a fantastic place.

234
00:09:51.40 --> 00:09:56.40
And every member I have of it is a good one.

235
00:09:56.40 --> 00:09:57.90
I grew up in Connecticut and Maine.

236
00:09:57.90 --> 00:10:01.40
So New England has definitely has a lot of nice things

237
00:10:01.40 --> 00:10:02.40
about that's for sure.

238
00:10:02.40 --> 00:10:04.40
So he's going away from the city.

239
00:10:04.40 --> 00:10:07.40
That is also for sure.

240
00:10:07.40 --> 00:10:11.40
So you end up going to DLI, Defence Language Institute.

241
00:10:11.40 --> 00:10:14.60
How, what did you just get a good score on the D-Lab or something?

242
00:10:14.60 --> 00:10:17.40
So the recruiter, you just said,

243
00:10:17.40 --> 00:10:19.40
told me I couldn't go straight to flight school.

244
00:10:19.40 --> 00:10:20.80
Is that true or not?

245
00:10:20.80 --> 00:10:21.80
It's not.

246
00:10:21.80 --> 00:10:23.80
So you've heard the lot.

247
00:10:23.80 --> 00:10:25.80
You know when the recruiter's lying, because the lips are moving.

248
00:10:25.80 --> 00:10:28.80
I mean, that's pretty much, they have a quota.

249
00:10:28.80 --> 00:10:30.80
They're trying to fill slots.

250
00:10:30.80 --> 00:10:32.80
They're going to push you in that direction.

251
00:10:32.80 --> 00:10:35.80
I guess they were just short Spanish voice intercepted operators

252
00:10:35.80 --> 00:10:36.80
at particular day.

253
00:10:36.80 --> 00:10:38.80
So he convinced me.

254
00:10:38.80 --> 00:10:40.80
And I talked to a couple of folks and they said,

255
00:10:40.80 --> 00:10:43.80
they're going to send you to school for a year to learn a language.

256
00:10:43.80 --> 00:10:44.80
That's a great deal.

257
00:10:44.80 --> 00:10:45.80
You should take it.

258
00:10:45.80 --> 00:10:47.80
So I agreed and I did it.

259
00:10:47.80 --> 00:10:49.80
So you went to Spanish school.

260
00:10:49.80 --> 00:10:52.80
And we dealt with things just behind music.

261
00:10:52.80 --> 00:10:53.80
We dealt with things just behind music.

262
00:10:53.80 --> 00:10:54.80
There were some things.

263
00:10:54.80 --> 00:10:55.80
Good work.

264
00:10:55.80 --> 00:10:55.80
Did you get sent you down in Panama?

265
00:10:55.80 --> 00:10:57.80
I did.

266
00:10:57.80 --> 00:10:58.80
Yeah.

267
00:10:58.80 --> 00:11:01.80
What were you doing flying up and listening listening in on the comms?

268
00:11:01.80 --> 00:11:05.80
No, we actually had a station there.

269
00:11:05.80 --> 00:11:06.80
Actually there were two.

270
00:11:06.80 --> 00:11:11.80
There were one on the E.S.

271
00:11:11.80 --> 00:11:08.80
One on the west side.

272
00:11:08.80 --> 00:11:12.80
And we were listening to cums throughout Central America.

273
00:11:12.80 --> 00:11:15.80
There's a gigantic antenna array and we sat right in the middle of it.

274
00:11:15.80 --> 00:11:23.12
My job was to find it and then like write a summary of what they were talking about and then it would go to the analyst and they would decide whether or not

275
00:11:23.12 --> 00:11:25.48
It was you know worth really documenting

276
00:11:25.48 --> 00:11:30.80
So I'm I'm recording it and I'm making notes just basically so it wasn't exactly the glamorous

277
00:11:31.12 --> 00:11:38.66
You know James Bond career that I thought it might be as described yeah, and you start putting in for flight school

278
00:11:39.80 --> 00:11:42.68
As soon as you get there very soon afterward

279
00:11:42.68 --> 00:11:46.16
I still remember you know I already wanted to fly and I was on the beach one day

280
00:11:46.16 --> 00:11:49.32
I mean Panama's pretty nice place to be don't get me wrong. It was a good assignment

281
00:11:49.32 --> 00:11:54.10
And these two Huey's came low level right over the beach and I'm like oh, yeah

282
00:11:54.10 --> 00:11:58.14
Yeah, I forgot about that I need to go pursue that because it you know

283
00:11:58.14 --> 00:12:02.18
It's just there's something about I don't know it helicopters if you get involved in them

284
00:12:02.18 --> 00:12:04.18
They get in your blood. You know there's there's nothing better and

285
00:12:05.64 --> 00:12:09.34
When I when I had that moment on the beach I said I'm getting this going again

286
00:12:09.34 --> 00:12:12.78
People don't realize now, you know everything we do is on our phone on you know

287
00:12:12.98 --> 00:12:18.26
Go log in the internet back then and you're filling out forms and you know making copies and and

288
00:12:18.54 --> 00:12:24.46
Putting it in an envelope so it was a it was a little bit of an adventure applying for flight school from overseas

289
00:12:24.74 --> 00:12:29.76
But I made it happen. I got accept how how was like the acceptance rate was it hard to get accepted?

290
00:12:30.50 --> 00:12:33.36
I don't know if it was super hard that the

291
00:12:34.22 --> 00:12:37.78
The hard part actually came in flight school a lot of people washed out or or

292
00:12:37.78 --> 00:12:44.90
You know again, they're trying to get certain numbers through so like our class started with 80 and we ended up graduating 40 now

293
00:12:44.90 --> 00:12:49.22
They didn't all get washed out, but they got pushed back to other classes. Yeah, so

294
00:12:49.90 --> 00:12:55.86
And that's what going right back in a boot camp when you when you go to for rocker Alabama as far as they're gonna

295
00:12:56.26 --> 00:13:00.18
Tighten you up and yeah, they can they shave your head again and you know

296
00:13:00.18 --> 00:13:04.34
You're doing square meals and you got five minutes to eat and you know

297
00:13:04.34 --> 00:13:10.50
They're yelling at you from the moment you wake up they're inspecting your bed, but it's all there's a purpose and I'm sure some of it

298
00:13:10.74 --> 00:13:14.46
Doesn't accomplish much but a lot of the stuff when you look back at it

299
00:13:14.46 --> 00:13:19.06
It's about attention to detail right? I mean if you're a pre-flight and aircraft or you're flying a mission

300
00:13:19.22 --> 00:13:23.38
You gotta be focused on what you're doing. I mean you know you can't be you know often lolol

301
00:13:23.38 --> 00:13:28.34
And you got it you gotta be you know that that's exactly two inches it's supposed to be two inches

302
00:13:28.34 --> 00:13:30.98
Okay, it's good move on to the next thing right, but

303
00:13:30.98 --> 00:13:37.30
You know at the time you're like why are they inspecting my bed? You know it doesn't seem to make sense

304
00:13:37.30 --> 00:13:41.02
But it weeds out the people that that can't do that sort of thing

305
00:13:41.02 --> 00:13:44.30
They don't have that discipline so you start off in a

306
00:13:44.90 --> 00:13:49.58
T-h 55 which I thought was funny you saying the book it they had those things painted bright orange

307
00:13:50.74 --> 00:13:52.74
Hey

308
00:13:52.74 --> 00:13:56.14
Student yes, yes, like student driver side

309
00:13:56.14 --> 00:14:04.66
Absolutely because they were dating my roommate had a mid air just a put in real active. Yeah, I mean we had see you solo with less than 10 hours in the aircraft

310
00:14:04.66 --> 00:14:06.02
So can you imagine

311
00:14:06.02 --> 00:14:09.78
10 hours of flight time and you're given a helicopter go take it around the pattern and

312
00:14:10.86 --> 00:14:17.26
He and another classmate crashed into each other because you're you're flying multiple runways

313
00:14:17.50 --> 00:14:22.98
That are parallel to each other so they're like opposite direction in the pattern and they both overshot

314
00:14:22.98 --> 00:14:26.34
And they ran into each other now fortunately

315
00:14:26.66 --> 00:14:32.54
It was minor damage, but again you got seven eight hours in a helicopter and you suddenly had a mid air

316
00:14:32.54 --> 00:14:37.30
What do I do? One of them thought yet an engine failure, which is not even close to what the problem was

317
00:14:37.46 --> 00:14:39.98
So he did what's called an auto rotation thing

318
00:14:39.98 --> 00:14:48.98
You know, but his engine's working fine. He just but he got it on the ground somehow. How do you how do you collide helicopters and not have a catastrophic event?

319
00:14:48.98 --> 00:14:54.18
It's your lucky day. I mean go straight to Vegas because I mean they should have opened dead and neither one of them

320
00:14:54.18 --> 00:15:02.94
Actually even washed out they kept they stayed with the class. That was amazing. Yeah, what part made contact so the rotor blades of one

321
00:15:04.62 --> 00:15:11.50
Impacted the landing gear and underneath of the other so it like chop part of the landing gear off and chop some antennas off

322
00:15:12.26 --> 00:15:18.34
And it makes it makes it yeah exciting times right out of the gate and then you go from that bird to a Huey

323
00:15:18.34 --> 00:15:24.14
Right, did you think you were in nom when you're flying the Huey actually it feels like you get in the space shuttle

324
00:15:24.14 --> 00:15:25.14
I mean because you know

325
00:15:25.54 --> 00:15:30.90
It's like a maybe you get into a Ferrari if you drive a Toyota every day

326
00:15:30.90 --> 00:15:34.26
You know, I mean just seems very advanced. There's just a lot of stuff in there and

327
00:15:34.90 --> 00:15:40.26
And then of course that happens again when I ultimately end up in the blackhawk, but you know each each leap forward is

328
00:15:40.50 --> 00:15:43.70
You know there's a lot more systems to know and a lot more gauges and

329
00:15:43.70 --> 00:15:50.18
It's just incredible you know the first time you fly this like wow, okay

330
00:15:50.18 --> 00:15:52.74
I'm really here. This is this is where I wanted to go

331
00:15:52.74 --> 00:15:59.78
You know and then you keep going beyond that it seems like again from my rudimentary knowledge and from being in you know

332
00:15:59.78 --> 00:16:02.34
Be it fine around in a Huey it seems like where you're in a Huey

333
00:16:04.34 --> 00:16:11.38
You're in a like a 19 65 muscle car and then when you go into a blackhawk

334
00:16:11.38 --> 00:16:15.78
You feel like you're in a in a brand new you know Tesla

335
00:16:16.42 --> 00:16:20.66
Like electronic everything is that accurate or am I just dumb?

336
00:16:20.66 --> 00:16:24.70
No, you're absolutely right now. It's be careful here because my wife is actually a Huey

337
00:16:24.70 --> 00:16:28.98
So I can't say any disparaging things about a Huey

338
00:16:28.98 --> 00:16:31.54
It's a great Eric she always jokes around and says you know the last

339
00:16:32.10 --> 00:16:36.82
When they fly the last blackhawk to a museum and they fly the crew out they'll fly that crew out with a Huey

340
00:16:36.82 --> 00:16:42.34
Because it'll be around long in the blackhawk ever well, but no you're right it just it seems

341
00:16:42.74 --> 00:16:45.58
I have a picture of the first flight I took in a blackhawk from

342
00:16:46.18 --> 00:16:50.38
Behind you know it has digital gauges and things like that did you just you know

343
00:16:50.38 --> 00:16:53.86
Don't have in those legacy aircraft they're all steam gauges or needles

344
00:16:54.26 --> 00:16:57.62
So you know again, it's it's like flying a spaceship

345
00:16:57.62 --> 00:17:00.74
I mean it really it's intimidating at first but after a while

346
00:17:00.74 --> 00:17:06.06
It's just an extension of yourself and then what was your so you get qualified in the blackhawk and then you go

347
00:17:06.06 --> 00:17:08.06
You end up getting stationed over in Korea

348
00:17:08.50 --> 00:17:14.10
To be to be a MetaVac pilot right and when I first got that assignment I'm like MetaVac

349
00:17:14.10 --> 00:17:16.30
You know, I don't want to go fly MetaVac

350
00:17:16.30 --> 00:17:19.02
I want to be you know in the 101st or

351
00:17:19.98 --> 00:17:24.74
You know one of the real you know go to war kind of units, but in the end

352
00:17:25.50 --> 00:17:29.30
Being in MetaVac was the best of time when I could get because you're by yourself

353
00:17:29.54 --> 00:17:32.34
You're you're constantly flying single ship missions

354
00:17:32.34 --> 00:17:38.74
You you graduate to pilot commands that it's very quickly so you start being forced into that decision making process and

355
00:17:38.82 --> 00:17:43.54
You know owning it and the responsibility and all those things that go along with being in charge of something

356
00:17:43.70 --> 00:17:47.38
Whereas if you if you go to a more traditional unit

357
00:17:47.62 --> 00:17:51.46
You're you're just kind of a duck in a row. You're not doing a lot of things on your own

358
00:17:51.46 --> 00:17:55.46
You don't have a lot of decision making put on you and I flew a lot

359
00:17:55.46 --> 00:17:59.74
We we flew a ton in that unit and as a brand new pilot

360
00:17:59.74 --> 00:18:05.82
You need those two things you need experience, you know moving the sticks around and you need to be put in situations where you have to make decisions

361
00:18:05.82 --> 00:18:11.18
That really helps you grow and you've got life and death situations happening because you're going to pick up guys that are in

362
00:18:11.66 --> 00:18:16.14
Your in training operations and one have you see you and I haven't said this yet

363
00:18:16.14 --> 00:18:18.62
But obviously I'm not reading this whole book right now

364
00:18:18.70 --> 00:18:22.38
You know you there's so much detail and you talk about the lessons you learned there

365
00:18:22.46 --> 00:18:28.58
That's some of the stuff that's in the book the books incredible for all kinds of lessons incredible storytelling

366
00:18:28.58 --> 00:18:36.10
And that's what you talk about some of those some of those situations that you were in where you had people's lives on the line and you're making decisions as a as a young

367
00:18:36.26 --> 00:18:42.18
Or an officer flying those birds definitely a lot of lessons learned there. Absolutely. I look back. I mean, I was 22

368
00:18:42.50 --> 00:18:46.58
And I look at you know I've got kids that are much older than that

369
00:18:46.58 --> 00:18:51.70
And I I'm like I'm not sure that I would put them in that responsibility nothing against them

370
00:18:51.70 --> 00:18:56.90
It's just you know you you think about how green you are you know

371
00:18:56.90 --> 00:19:00.42
I mean that's that's fairly young to be taking on that kind of responsibility

372
00:19:00.42 --> 00:19:06.18
But that's that's how you evolve and become once you you really can be if you don't even push the limit

373
00:19:06.18 --> 00:19:09.86
You're not ever going to get where you might go so you do that opt you do the

374
00:19:10.26 --> 00:19:13.38
MetaVac for two years in Korea. Yeah, it's a one year tour

375
00:19:13.38 --> 00:19:17.38
But I was getting so much flight time and I liked it there so much. I said hey, I'll stay longer

376
00:19:17.38 --> 00:19:22.82
So I extended my tour not quite two years, but almost and from there you had back to a

377
00:19:22.82 --> 00:19:26.82
Fort Campbell

378
00:19:27.22 --> 00:19:30.66
When you're there I'm gonna go to the book here in January 1986

379
00:19:30.66 --> 00:19:36.18
I reported back to Fort Campbell and with another pilot from my MetaVac unit in Korea bought a house off base

380
00:19:36.42 --> 00:19:39.14
I remember it well because I was as I was unpacking

381
00:19:40.10 --> 00:19:46.18
Gear the television was on and I stood there open mouth watching the explosion the space shutter shuttle

382
00:19:46.34 --> 00:19:47.38
Challenger

383
00:19:47.38 --> 00:19:49.06
There was a national tragedy

384
00:19:49.06 --> 00:19:53.30
But considering how long the space program had gone without a fatal miss app I wasn't at all surprised

385
00:19:53.46 --> 00:19:57.78
It's a reminder that if you spend your career in the air you can't get complacent

386
00:20:00.82 --> 00:20:03.94
The next day I was ready and raring to audition

387
00:20:04.90 --> 00:20:08.90
for the 160 of special operations aviation regiment

388
00:20:09.94 --> 00:20:16.42
How would you heard about the night stalkers prior to this so they were still kind of under cover at that under cover's not really right

389
00:20:16.42 --> 00:20:20.42
Word but not not really spoken about publicly certainly not by the military

390
00:20:20.66 --> 00:20:22.74
I actually heard about him in a bar in Korea

391
00:20:23.62 --> 00:20:29.70
Some guy talking about hey they get this unit, you know, and I read Tom Clancy books. I mean I was I was you know

392
00:20:29.86 --> 00:20:31.70
Very intrigued by that sort of thing

393
00:20:32.50 --> 00:20:40.90
Never really been exposed to the to the real world part of it but new it all existed and and thought you know that could be the next level for me

394
00:20:40.90 --> 00:20:42.90
You know and and

395
00:20:42.90 --> 00:20:47.86
Soon as I heard about it I was very very intrigued and I thought yeah, I'd like to end up there someday

396
00:20:48.58 --> 00:20:52.82
And you know naive at the time in terms of what it would take to get there

397
00:20:53.14 --> 00:20:56.98
But that's when the the seed was planted and it was it was a

398
00:20:58.26 --> 00:21:04.66
I was almost like a little mix up when you went there because you went and you signed into the hundred and first and sort of checked on board

399
00:21:05.22 --> 00:21:10.74
And once you checked on board the guys at the 160th were like you already checked on board with the hundred first

400
00:21:10.74 --> 00:21:17.78
Sorry right my orders were to the hundred first I signed in and at that point they got their claws on me and I can't get out of it

401
00:21:18.02 --> 00:21:22.50
And then good you know sometimes things in life happen and they end up being good even though

402
00:21:22.50 --> 00:21:25.06
It's not what you wanted to have happened, but I got more experience

403
00:21:25.70 --> 00:21:29.86
Went to the instructor pilot course, you know got a bunch of night vision goggle time all things

404
00:21:29.86 --> 00:21:36.42
It really helped before you make that leap to the to the soft world and so then you spend that time at the hundred first

405
00:21:38.18 --> 00:21:40.18
and your your

406
00:21:40.18 --> 00:21:44.66
Are you figuring out more about the night stalkers at this time you learn and more?

407
00:21:44.74 --> 00:21:48.02
Yeah, so that's when I run across clay hot marker

408
00:21:48.02 --> 00:21:49.78
I know you know and

409
00:21:49.78 --> 00:21:54.34
He actually at the time when I first met him was at W2 so he had been a Marine

410
00:21:54.50 --> 00:22:00.98
I think you know the story then he was at W2 when I met him and then he got commissioned as a second lieutenant and ultimately retired

411
00:22:00.98 --> 00:22:03.46
The two star generals so he just couldn't hold a job

412
00:22:03.46 --> 00:22:05.46
I don't want the problem but

413
00:22:05.46 --> 00:22:07.46
When I met him he

414
00:22:07.46 --> 00:22:13.38
You know he knew about the unit and in fact he had gotten into the unit and brought me over there to look at the aircraft

415
00:22:13.38 --> 00:22:15.38
So not only is now the mission

416
00:22:15.78 --> 00:22:16.98
a seam

417
00:22:16.98 --> 00:22:18.34
You know very

418
00:22:18.34 --> 00:22:24.26
Full of intrigue, but the aircraft themselves have got the sexy equipment on board that I didn't even know existed

419
00:22:24.26 --> 00:22:26.82
I mean we had forward looking infrared systems

420
00:22:26.82 --> 00:22:28.42
I mean this is 1988

421
00:22:28.42 --> 00:22:30.02
Most people didn't know

422
00:22:30.02 --> 00:22:34.10
Flier even existed, you know and and it's already on the aircraft they've already got it

423
00:22:34.10 --> 00:22:35.62
They have a digital cockpit

424
00:22:35.62 --> 00:22:39.46
I mean it was very rudimentary from today standards, but

425
00:22:40.18 --> 00:22:43.38
again, you know this is just stuff that was

426
00:22:44.02 --> 00:22:50.18
Unheard of and I'm thinking so it's a super cool mission flying for these super cool customers with these

427
00:22:50.34 --> 00:22:52.82
Super cool aircraft. I got to figure out how to get over here

428
00:22:52.82 --> 00:22:58.34
So that that just kind of amp me up a little bit more actually and then what was the selection process?

429
00:22:58.34 --> 00:22:59.86
Once you got over to

430
00:22:59.86 --> 00:23:07.94
To the 160 of so I actually ended up being in the first formal green platoon that the unit ever did before my class

431
00:23:08.50 --> 00:23:12.42
You'd basically just get assigned to a company and then your green platoon was

432
00:23:13.46 --> 00:23:18.42
Informal just did kind of the same things, but it wasn't a dedicated class and

433
00:23:18.66 --> 00:23:23.94
You know model somewhat after buds and some of the other training courses the unit realized

434
00:23:23.94 --> 00:23:28.66
We need a we need a dedicated course to get people through because there's too much of a burden on the unit

435
00:23:28.66 --> 00:23:32.66
The unit needs to be focused on executing you know missions and training the

436
00:23:33.38 --> 00:23:39.86
The the unit level the training of new people should be done by a dedicated training organization

437
00:23:39.86 --> 00:23:45.78
So they created this you know green platoon as it's called now and it includes you know all the typical stuff

438
00:23:45.78 --> 00:23:50.34
The land nav physical fitness, swim test, cycle valve, lot of flying

439
00:23:50.90 --> 00:23:53.22
You know life saving shooting, you know

440
00:23:53.22 --> 00:23:58.74
Not at the level that you went through but you know our focus is more on the aviation part

441
00:23:58.82 --> 00:24:01.46
But you get a fair amount of all that other stuff just so

442
00:24:01.62 --> 00:24:05.70
You know if you end up in a situation where you're not pilot anymore you're on the ground

443
00:24:05.70 --> 00:24:10.50
You're at least not a burden to the ground for as you can do something besides just sit there and say you know

444
00:24:11.06 --> 00:24:12.42
Help get me home, you know

445
00:24:12.42 --> 00:24:17.06
So so I think that's the main idea, you know you do some life saving stuff if you shoot a weapon that's sort of thing

446
00:24:17.70 --> 00:24:19.70
And it lasted

447
00:24:19.70 --> 00:24:27.22
I'm thinking it lasted nine months, so I mean it's pretty long time a lot of flying and that's the flying is usually what ends up

448
00:24:27.22 --> 00:24:30.82
Weeding people out because and I think this is still the case today

449
00:24:32.42 --> 00:24:36.42
The the philosophy was yeah global positioning system is great

450
00:24:36.90 --> 00:24:40.58
But when it goes down you still got to be able to get your customers on the target so

451
00:24:41.14 --> 00:24:48.90
We really focused heavily on land nav with a map, you know planning drawing lines on a map and being able to hit that target

452
00:24:48.90 --> 00:24:55.22
Even if your systems go down and that's hard to do because especially when you start relying on the technology because then you

453
00:24:55.62 --> 00:24:59.62
It's like getting over here today, you know, I mean to think about where I was going I hit Uber

454
00:24:59.94 --> 00:25:04.50
Put the address in you know, I didn't even know how long it would take until I I'd punched all that stuff in

455
00:25:04.50 --> 00:25:09.62
But if you rely too heavily on that you know and things really matter like you know getting

456
00:25:10.18 --> 00:25:17.78
Getting soft operators on a target you got to be able to do it no matter what so there's a lot of a lot of focus on that manual stuff and

457
00:25:17.78 --> 00:25:21.14
Some people just aren't very adept at that and I'm not a great navigator

458
00:25:21.14 --> 00:25:26.02
I know some great navigators. I mean these guys the map like it jumps out with Adam

459
00:25:26.02 --> 00:25:32.26
They they they see it different than I see it for me. It's a bunch of lines and if it's not an interstate highway

460
00:25:32.26 --> 00:25:35.14
Or major body of water. I again identify it all that well

461
00:25:35.38 --> 00:25:41.86
But these other guys are just unbelievable and and so you always want to be paired with one of those guys because they can they can help you

462
00:25:41.86 --> 00:25:45.78
But I mean I do it well obviously well enough because I made it through the training

463
00:25:45.78 --> 00:25:53.46
But it it was it was just fantastic you learn all this special mission to quit me you know like things like fast rope at the time

464
00:25:54.50 --> 00:25:58.10
The army didn't do fast ropes. I don't know they do it widespread even today

465
00:25:58.10 --> 00:26:04.26
So you got to learn how to do that you got to learn you know just all these different things that you learn that you didn't learn in your previous

466
00:26:04.26 --> 00:26:09.06
Experience is all part of Greenblatton so when you show up you're at least a copilot you're ready to

467
00:26:09.46 --> 00:26:11.70
Jump in and and serve that copilot

468
00:26:11.70 --> 00:26:14.02
Position and just to give people some

469
00:26:14.02 --> 00:26:18.66
Some background because we were kind of talking about it because you and I know about it

470
00:26:18.74 --> 00:26:26.02
But you say in the book here to clarify what the one 60th is which is their their nickname their call sign is the night stalkers

471
00:26:26.26 --> 00:26:30.26
You say this the night stalkers or strictly a special operations outfit

472
00:26:30.58 --> 00:26:35.22
They had the best helicopters the latest equipment and an unlimited acquisition budget

473
00:26:35.54 --> 00:26:39.94
They flew mostly at night using the latest technology night vision devices

474
00:26:39.94 --> 00:26:47.54
Deep behind enemy lines racing just above sand dunes ocean waves or jungle canopies to deliver special ops teams

475
00:26:48.18 --> 00:26:52.50
Their missions were hostage rescues snatching grabs a bad guy's

476
00:26:52.90 --> 00:26:55.70
Even liberations of enemy equipment

477
00:26:55.94 --> 00:27:00.50
Their customers were the elite of the elite and strictly can't classified

478
00:27:00.90 --> 00:27:08.74
Meaning Navy seals army Rangers or other special mission units the existence of the night stalkers was officially denied

479
00:27:08.74 --> 00:27:13.62
And their pilots had reputations as the James bonds of the community

480
00:27:14.26 --> 00:27:21.94
If a mission was regarded as impossible the night stalkers would get it and impossible had always been seductive to me

481
00:27:23.46 --> 00:27:28.98
So that's a little bit of what what what what the night stalkers do what their mission is what their mission set is

482
00:27:30.02 --> 00:27:33.70
So you end up obviously you you get there

483
00:27:33.70 --> 00:27:38.02
I'm gonna fast forward through the book a little bit past some of those experiences

484
00:27:39.62 --> 00:27:41.62
And here we go on Sunday

485
00:27:41.62 --> 00:27:49.06
December 17th I was packing up bathing suits and sun tan lotion at my house in Clarksville when my page are beeped and hummed

486
00:27:50.02 --> 00:27:53.94
At the time Clay hotmocker had become my platoon leader

487
00:27:54.26 --> 00:27:59.78
But he was already more than that clay lived right above lorry and me in our two family house

488
00:27:59.78 --> 00:28:04.66
So he'd spent a lot of time together on and off base he was my boss, but he was also my friend

489
00:28:05.22 --> 00:28:08.34
I called him to Fort Campbell and he picked up on the first ring

490
00:28:09.06 --> 00:28:12.42
Hotmocker Durant come on in Roger that

491
00:28:13.38 --> 00:28:19.94
I did not experience even a twinge of surprise and I quickly switched my vacation suitcase for my combat duffle

492
00:28:20.66 --> 00:28:26.90
Like many special operators. I was a news junkie watching and listening international flare-ups

493
00:28:26.90 --> 00:28:35.54
The way stockbrokers scan the ticks in the market. I knew that Manuel Noriega had already pushed the United States over the edge

494
00:28:35.94 --> 00:28:42.34
On Saturday night four young officers had been driving downtown in Panama City in the search of the perfect pizza

495
00:28:43.46 --> 00:28:48.58
Outside Noriega's military headquarters they had been stopped at a PDF roadblock

496
00:28:49.30 --> 00:28:51.46
When members of the national the police

497
00:28:51.46 --> 00:28:58.90
Begin beating on the car with the tons and hauling the hauling on the door handles the young Americans concluded that they were about to disappear

498
00:28:58.90 --> 00:29:05.86
Into one of Noriega's notorious dungeons forever the driver hit the gas pedal as the panomanians open fire

499
00:29:06.74 --> 00:29:09.22
Killing Marine first lieutenant Robert Paz

500
00:29:10.02 --> 00:29:16.90
It hadn't ended there an American Navy Lieutenant Adam Curtis had witnessed the shooting incident along with his wife

501
00:29:17.30 --> 00:29:19.30
Both of them were dragged off

502
00:29:19.30 --> 00:29:27.14
For interrogations while Mrs Curtis was forced to assume the position against a prison cell wall and repeatedly threatened with rape

503
00:29:27.14 --> 00:29:31.54
Her husband was gagged pistol whipped and kicked in the groin right in front of her

504
00:29:32.10 --> 00:29:38.18
This had gone on for four hours until the battered young couple was released to collapse into a public street

505
00:29:39.06 --> 00:29:42.58
Noriega's message had been clearly received in Washington

506
00:29:43.38 --> 00:29:45.38
Come and get me green goes

507
00:29:45.38 --> 00:29:56.42
So that's what you're getting called in for and an interesting side note here the officer the Navy officer that you talk about here Adam Curtis

508
00:29:57.22 --> 00:29:59.22
He was actually a seal and

509
00:30:00.02 --> 00:30:06.18
I worked with him. He was my task unit commander in a platoon and I think it was 1995 so

510
00:30:06.66 --> 00:30:09.14
5 or 6 years after this happened he was my

511
00:30:10.34 --> 00:30:13.46
Yeah, he was my my task unit commander

512
00:30:13.46 --> 00:30:15.46
Interesting

513
00:30:15.46 --> 00:30:18.02
It is a small world especially in the soft world

514
00:30:19.30 --> 00:30:20.50
So

515
00:30:20.50 --> 00:30:23.62
Talked us a little bit about Panama and what you did there

516
00:30:24.18 --> 00:30:29.22
You know, I've said multiple times lately as I've talked about you know my my background and

517
00:30:29.54 --> 00:30:34.74
Everyone knows me by black-hawked down, you know one day and it's 22 year career and if I could pick

518
00:30:35.30 --> 00:30:40.18
What people knew me by it actually probably picked just cause because when you think about

519
00:30:40.18 --> 00:30:48.42
What we trained for at the macro level? I mean this was it was a host of dress-gu on that mission

520
00:30:48.82 --> 00:30:50.82
There was an airfield take down on that mission

521
00:30:51.54 --> 00:30:53.54
Seals disabled airplanes that

522
00:30:54.10 --> 00:30:57.30
Terriho's was gonna or Noriega was gonna try to get out on

523
00:30:58.34 --> 00:31:01.38
It was a largest airborne drop since Vietnam down a Riojo

524
00:31:01.94 --> 00:31:06.18
Apache's got used for the first time F1 17 got used for the first time. I mean it was

525
00:31:06.18 --> 00:31:12.18
This was about as complicated and up as it get and it was it all went down in like 36 hours

526
00:31:12.18 --> 00:31:15.78
I mean that moment you just described when I'm in my living room

527
00:31:16.42 --> 00:31:20.18
We're launching on each hour a day and a half later at one o'clock in the morning

528
00:31:20.18 --> 00:31:24.02
I started number looking at Donovan Bradley who I flew with on that mission and he ends up

529
00:31:24.18 --> 00:31:26.18
Donovan loses life in some in Somalia

530
00:31:27.46 --> 00:31:30.66
Like is this real because you know we we've been to

531
00:31:30.66 --> 00:31:38.74
To prime chance which was technically a combat off but no hostility is really when we were there when I was there

532
00:31:38.74 --> 00:31:45.06
Where was prime chance in the Persian Gulf the Iranians were mining the okay on the barges and we're not so we lived on the barges and

533
00:31:45.38 --> 00:31:48.98
That's actually the first time that night vision goggles were used in combat

534
00:31:49.54 --> 00:31:55.38
One of the guys from the one sixtieth little bird guy shot a bog hammer that was dropping mines into the sea

535
00:31:55.38 --> 00:32:02.98
And use the flushet actually and one of the Iranians after they captured them is still got a flushet in his cheek

536
00:32:03.54 --> 00:32:06.02
So obviously round on target

537
00:32:06.26 --> 00:32:16.42
But you know for Donovan and I want to clock in the morning flying on this mission with two Apache's to go down the Rio Hado to support this airfield seizure

538
00:32:16.42 --> 00:32:22.50
I mean we're sort of in disbelief, you know because how many times you get spun up and spun that you know

539
00:32:22.50 --> 00:32:28.58
They were gonna go we're gonna go and then we're not going and then that 2000 pound bomb goes off at

540
00:32:29.46 --> 00:32:34.26
Precisely one a. You know we all bash our our our the other services, you know

541
00:32:34.26 --> 00:32:38.34
There are no engineers good as us, but I will give the Air Force credit that bomb hit

542
00:32:39.06 --> 00:32:42.90
Precisely at one o'clock in the morning and it was a pretty big splash

543
00:32:42.90 --> 00:32:46.66
I mean 2000 pound bomb makes a heck of a flash in the middle of night

544
00:32:47.54 --> 00:32:50.66
So at that point we we realize you know this is real

545
00:32:50.66 --> 00:32:52.66
But over the next you know several days

546
00:32:53.62 --> 00:32:59.86
You know just amazing missions just complete success highly complex op and

547
00:33:01.46 --> 00:33:09.06
Just that to me was the the ultimate special operations mission just so many facets

548
00:33:10.02 --> 00:33:16.66
All done well now we took some losses, you know we we lost a couple pilots and a firefight in in

549
00:33:16.66 --> 00:33:21.14
Colone daytime, you know that's always when we end up in trouble. We're in close

550
00:33:21.78 --> 00:33:24.42
Trying to take on people that you can't see

551
00:33:24.82 --> 00:33:30.10
There's a lot of ways to shoot a helicopter down and unfortunately this little bird got shot down a couple of days later

552
00:33:30.10 --> 00:33:32.58
Both pilots were killed, but but overall

553
00:33:33.38 --> 00:33:37.46
Just an incredible mission and you know ultimately we do end up getting men one or yaga and

554
00:33:38.02 --> 00:33:44.10
He gets flown out actually by Cliff Walcott who was flying with Jonathan Briley and Somalia when he lost his life

555
00:33:44.10 --> 00:33:47.62
So they were all one you know just one band of brothers, you know and

556
00:33:48.26 --> 00:33:51.86
Being able to participate and knows kind of ops and I actually ended up supporting

557
00:33:52.58 --> 00:33:54.58
Seals

558
00:33:54.58 --> 00:33:58.10
On the on the Colone side that was that was my mission we were

559
00:33:58.90 --> 00:34:04.58
You know trying to find Noria. We call it the hunt for Elvis you know because they were Elvis sightings all over the place

560
00:34:04.58 --> 00:34:08.18
You know we get people we call it and say yeah, he's over here and we go

561
00:34:08.58 --> 00:34:13.22
It wasn't quite that you know the helicopter but there were several missions where we thought

562
00:34:13.22 --> 00:34:19.14
Okay, this is legit intel you know it's legit a minute enough to launch and we would take a place down and

563
00:34:19.62 --> 00:34:22.10
He was never there but finally, you know as as

564
00:34:22.82 --> 00:34:27.46
Most people know we found him hiding and he eventually gave up and we flew them out

565
00:34:27.86 --> 00:34:30.18
What was that what was the total time that you spent down there?

566
00:34:31.06 --> 00:34:36.34
Well oddly enough I departed early because I had to go teach green plateau

567
00:34:36.34 --> 00:34:41.06
I got to the point in the unit where I was now teaching others scary scary thought

568
00:34:41.06 --> 00:34:43.06
But

569
00:34:43.06 --> 00:34:46.42
And I had to go back and and start the training you know things were starting to wind down

570
00:34:46.82 --> 00:34:52.42
I think Noria had been located and that the number of direct action missions was was scaling back

571
00:34:52.82 --> 00:34:55.46
You know we had control of the whole country so there wasn't any need to really

572
00:34:56.42 --> 00:35:01.30
You know keep flying as many missions that we had been flying so the commander decided hey go back

573
00:35:01.54 --> 00:35:03.22
Teach Green poll two and so I was only there

574
00:35:03.70 --> 00:35:07.30
Probably a week I mean you know to get all that done in a week that's why I say

575
00:35:07.30 --> 00:35:11.78
If there was something that I could be known for I wish it was that mission because it really was amazing

576
00:35:11.78 --> 00:35:16.82
But that is just a footnote in history for most of us. Yeah, well the good thing is in the book

577
00:35:16.82 --> 00:35:19.94
You detail you go through a lot of those details talk about what those missions were like

578
00:35:20.66 --> 00:35:26.58
Yeah, it's it's it's really good for me to read it because I I only ever got debriefed on like

579
00:35:26.58 --> 00:35:32.26
What the seal specifically did so it was very cool to hear from your perspective and see what I'll bunch of the other units

580
00:35:32.26 --> 00:35:34.74
Including you know your unit right good to see

581
00:35:34.74 --> 00:35:36.74
Um

582
00:35:36.74 --> 00:35:40.18
I wanted to say something and if I forget to say it later. I really appreciate how

583
00:35:41.22 --> 00:35:48.34
Complimentary you you were in extreme ownership about the conventional army units that you work with because you know a lot of times

584
00:35:49.06 --> 00:35:54.58
We at least in my era there wasn't a lot of combat experience so for us the special ops guys

585
00:35:54.58 --> 00:36:00.26
Kind of looked down on those and that was wrong and I I always felt you know after the fact that there was

586
00:36:00.26 --> 00:36:06.66
Immatured on my part to kind of look at them that way because they just didn't have the experience. They just hadn't done it, you know, but you know, but you know

587
00:36:06.66 --> 00:36:09.62
To hear your perspective on you know battle hardened

588
00:36:10.10 --> 00:36:14.90
Convention on units out there kicking ass just like everybody else. I was just really appreciate that. That was good stuff

589
00:36:15.14 --> 00:36:18.26
Well, I'd I'd love to take some kind of credit for for that

590
00:36:18.26 --> 00:36:23.86
But when we were we were lucky enough to be in those situations where I mean I was just working side by side with those guys

591
00:36:24.26 --> 00:36:30.18
And and there was just no doubt in there in their professionalism in their bravery and it was it

592
00:36:30.18 --> 00:36:36.26
An honor to be able to serve alongside them and not even just active duty army and Marine Corps, but you know when we got to

593
00:36:36.26 --> 00:36:40.42
Ramadi in 2006 it was a national guard national guard on the ground and they were they were

594
00:36:41.06 --> 00:36:47.46
Doing an incredible job taking the fight to the enemy and and they you know I told Colonel Gronski he came on this podcast

595
00:36:48.98 --> 00:36:56.10
100% my some of my guys are alive because the lessons that we learned from the national guard when we showed up there

596
00:36:56.10 --> 00:37:04.74
And then when the one one AD showed up 100% some of my guys are alive because when we called they came the one one

597
00:37:04.74 --> 00:37:09.46
AD whatever battalion came and there was multiple over and over again

598
00:37:09.78 --> 00:37:14.98
So we owe so much to those guys and and we won't ever forget them, but I think you're right

599
00:37:14.98 --> 00:37:19.54
You know when I was in the sealed teams in the 90s, you know, we we we definitely were

600
00:37:19.54 --> 00:37:25.78
I think partially just ignorant and and and partially arrogant right

601
00:37:26.02 --> 00:37:33.86
Well, they just they hadn't been to war so you know in our minds we're the real world guys and they're just practicing right

602
00:37:33.86 --> 00:37:37.06
But they they and you think about national guard in particular

603
00:37:37.06 --> 00:37:42.10
I mean most national guard units had not deployed you know prior to 911 for decades

604
00:37:42.10 --> 00:37:47.46
Yeah, to know that they ramped up like this amazing they did indeed as a tribute to an attack

605
00:37:47.46 --> 00:37:49.46
It's a testament to the American war fighter

606
00:37:51.14 --> 00:37:53.14
Fast forward a little bit more

607
00:37:54.74 --> 00:38:00.90
You end up in the first Gulf War right you say here the word been ramping up since the Iraqis invaded Kuwait and August

608
00:38:01.30 --> 00:38:06.34
Those of us who had been invited were pleased to be there no one was happier about it than Cliff Walcott

609
00:38:07.14 --> 00:38:10.26
His innovative concept the direct action penetrator

610
00:38:10.66 --> 00:38:15.62
Configuration of the black off Hawk which had missed the party in Panama was finally going to see some action

611
00:38:15.62 --> 00:38:23.30
However, while Charlie company in it's and its daps that's the direct action penetrator had drawn us the assignment to provide four of the gunships for

612
00:38:23.30 --> 00:38:30.02
Skud hunting they didn't have enough qualified pilots for this operation so five of us from Delta company myself Cliff clay hot

613
00:38:30.02 --> 00:38:34.10
mocker Eddie mole and Stan Wood have been called upon to complete the package

614
00:38:34.10 --> 00:38:40.34
So this is kind of a new deal the outfitted these these black cocks with more weapon systems

615
00:38:40.34 --> 00:38:43.94
So they could they could bring some firebour more firebour right

616
00:38:43.94 --> 00:38:46.34
You know the unit doesn't have a patchy so

617
00:38:46.90 --> 00:38:50.50
What we were trying to do is is provide a patchy like capability

618
00:38:50.98 --> 00:38:56.74
But not have to have a dedicated platform because that that's the issue right if you can only put so many birds on a C5

619
00:38:57.94 --> 00:39:01.94
If you could put one on there that could do both the attack mission and the assault mission

620
00:39:01.94 --> 00:39:05.94
That gives a ground force commander a lot more opportunity to you know to react

621
00:39:06.50 --> 00:39:08.98
So he was a brilliant idea and I'm actually

622
00:39:08.98 --> 00:39:13.78
Shocked that it hasn't and it taken on more of a life certainly with international

623
00:39:14.82 --> 00:39:21.22
Black Hawk operators because it's essentially two for one. I mean you're getting an attack helicopter and an assault helicopter

624
00:39:21.78 --> 00:39:23.78
And having been there

625
00:39:24.34 --> 00:39:30.98
You know a day one when this whole concept was put together and Cliff was the godfather. I mean he he was a cober guy and

626
00:39:32.18 --> 00:39:34.98
He just you know from the moment he started flying black cocks

627
00:39:34.98 --> 00:39:36.98
I think I got a figure out a put guns on this thing

628
00:39:36.98 --> 00:39:38.98
You know this is a waste of my time and

629
00:39:39.86 --> 00:39:44.74
And we finally did it today. I mean the thing is got I mean it looks like a easy one 30

630
00:39:44.74 --> 00:39:46.74
It's got stuff all over the place yeah

631
00:39:47.94 --> 00:39:53.30
I'm gonna fast forward a little bit here you're out on an operation your scud hunting

632
00:39:54.34 --> 00:39:57.94
Zulu three two this is Charlie seven Charlie four seven

633
00:39:58.58 --> 00:40:00.34
It was lieutenant Colonel Doug Brown

634
00:40:00.34 --> 00:40:07.86
Battalion commander of the first baton of the 160th making contact from the jock in a roar

635
00:40:08.66 --> 00:40:14.66
Roger four seven I answered go ahead. I have a mission change for you three two. He said Colonel Brown's voice was

636
00:40:15.22 --> 00:40:20.10
Usually cold as ice water but on this night he actually sounded a little keyed up copy these coordinates

637
00:40:20.50 --> 00:40:22.50
Roger that I said as

638
00:40:22.74 --> 00:40:27.46
And as Lance continued the lazy orbit over the activities below I repeated the coordinates back to Brown

639
00:40:27.46 --> 00:40:34.10
You are cleared to direct to the target three two the Colonel ordered target is a possible

640
00:40:35.46 --> 00:40:37.30
And he couldn't hear him

641
00:40:37.30 --> 00:40:42.26
Transmission of broken up on the last word four seven I said say again all after coordinate

642
00:40:42.50 --> 00:40:45.70
Roger that brown answered I say again. It is a crossword

643
00:40:46.74 --> 00:40:51.30
The sack calm failed again. I fumed I keep the mic button once more

644
00:40:51.30 --> 00:40:59.14
47 you're breaking up please spell all after and he said Sierra Charlie uniform delta brown growled

645
00:41:00.10 --> 00:41:04.98
And then you knew it was a scud and again this is interesting because

646
00:41:05.70 --> 00:41:11.70
The individual that you're talking about lieutenant Colonel Doug Brown ended up being the four star

647
00:41:12.82 --> 00:41:16.66
So calm commander in charge of all special operations and when he was in that job

648
00:41:16.66 --> 00:41:20.82
I was actually the admiral's aid for Admiral Joe McGuire and

649
00:41:21.70 --> 00:41:26.82
We would see General Brown all the time and did a bunch of trips with him and got to know him

650
00:41:27.38 --> 00:41:34.34
Just what a great guy. He was as well. Yeah, you know, you say he's usually cold as ice water super

651
00:41:34.34 --> 00:41:43.78
I mean just super unemotional very very calm laid back and here you are half this opportunity to get these scuds and

652
00:41:46.42 --> 00:41:52.42
So I gotta tell you just remind of me I'm actually writing this down on my knee board because we have a knee board

653
00:41:52.82 --> 00:41:59.70
And you know he sent the coordinates I got to write those down and then he's I'm trying to figure out what neck is he saying and then he does it phonetically

654
00:41:59.70 --> 00:42:01.70
And I still remember

655
00:42:01.70 --> 00:42:05.38
See it's like a game show, you know, oh

656
00:42:06.18 --> 00:42:08.18
Yeah, I got it Scott for a hundred dollars

657
00:42:10.90 --> 00:42:12.90
But the first one that you went to go

658
00:42:13.70 --> 00:42:16.74
Attack your weapons didn't work right? Yes

659
00:42:17.46 --> 00:42:24.58
Talked through that so that's gotta be just a little bit frustrating because it's just cool the scuds at the time

660
00:42:25.30 --> 00:42:31.22
Because I was in the Navy now, but the scuds with his huge threat like this was the major threat

661
00:42:31.22 --> 00:42:36.98
That they had they could arm him with chemical weapons. It was this that was the big focus you heard all the news all the time

662
00:42:37.14 --> 00:42:42.18
Was scuds scuds good scuds good? We got to get these scuds. We got to stop these scuds and they had launch scuds

663
00:42:42.58 --> 00:42:51.14
And so here you are you finally get one of these scuds and you got your your new air craft with all of its weapons on it and you roll in to shoot that thing

664
00:42:51.14 --> 00:42:52.18
What happens?

665
00:42:52.18 --> 00:42:53.14
Nothing

666
00:42:53.14 --> 00:42:57.14
I

667
00:42:57.14 --> 00:43:01.14
Gives my my potter get wet. I don't know what happened. No, we know what happened. So

668
00:43:02.50 --> 00:43:05.86
I'm flying and I push the trigger and nothing happens and

669
00:43:07.54 --> 00:43:12.90
I come around again and I'm flying with Lansing all who you mentioned a moment ago and

670
00:43:13.94 --> 00:43:18.18
I'm like check the switches so he checks the switches because you know there's a lot of stuff you got to do and

671
00:43:18.50 --> 00:43:23.06
You can do something incorrectly and it's not armed technically and I come around again

672
00:43:23.06 --> 00:43:25.78
I push the trigger still nothing. What are you trying to engage with?

673
00:43:26.42 --> 00:43:33.46
So all we had was miniguns 7.62 which are formidable, but you know, I mean that's not a typical

674
00:43:34.02 --> 00:43:39.22
Tag helicopter weapon, but we used them in a fixed forward mode, so you're diving fire on the target

675
00:43:40.26 --> 00:43:46.42
And then rockets. I mean so normally our profile would be you start shooting the minifurst and then you fire

676
00:43:46.42 --> 00:43:55.62
Now the rockets they're they're free flying aerial rockets FFAR so they're not guided and they come out of the two

677
00:43:55.62 --> 00:43:58.82
Move and kind of slow so they're hard to hit a

678
00:44:00.58 --> 00:44:02.58
Precise target weapon

679
00:44:02.58 --> 00:44:06.90
So we always use the minigun first and then we follow that with rockets once we knew you know

680
00:44:06.90 --> 00:44:10.66
We were kind of aligned on the target and if you did it enough you got pretty good at it

681
00:44:10.66 --> 00:44:12.66
You could you could hit a point target like a vehicle

682
00:44:13.46 --> 00:44:15.46
Fairly off not every time

683
00:44:15.46 --> 00:44:20.98
So I'm trying to hit you know obviously minigun first and then I'm gonna go to rockets and I try I'm both the need of one works

684
00:44:22.10 --> 00:44:24.10
So

685
00:44:24.82 --> 00:44:28.42
I look at lands and I said plants it's one

686
00:44:28.74 --> 00:44:31.14
F and switch arm it you know

687
00:44:31.14 --> 00:44:33.30
I figured it had to be him you know

688
00:44:33.86 --> 00:44:39.38
It can't be the aircraft so we come around again. It still doesn't work. I mean I'm so upset

689
00:44:39.78 --> 00:44:42.42
It's like a quite a two if you're a hunter

690
00:44:42.42 --> 00:44:47.22
This is the biggest buck you've ever seen in your life the biggest buck the entire nation

691
00:44:47.22 --> 00:44:51.78
Yes, I want to you to hunt this buck and he's standing there just chew and you know

692
00:44:52.34 --> 00:44:57.54
Stationary broadside and you can't chew I mean it was unreal

693
00:44:57.78 --> 00:45:05.22
I got so upset again, you know, I should I've been probably not but I think I said something like I'm crashing is freaking

694
00:45:05.22 --> 00:45:06.26
Aircraft

695
00:45:06.26 --> 00:45:07.46
You're going comma causing

696
00:45:07.46 --> 00:45:09.46
That's what you're saying the fuck

697
00:45:09.46 --> 00:45:11.46
I just was that upset and

698
00:45:13.38 --> 00:45:20.10
Unfortunately, you know, we're gonna flight it to aircraft so the other aircraft is just making these same orbits and shooting

699
00:45:20.50 --> 00:45:26.58
And I'm not only I as it that I can't shoot, but I'm watching him shoot and he can't shoot nearly as good as me

700
00:45:26.90 --> 00:45:30.42
And he's not even hitting the target so I see you've making me more furious

701
00:45:30.82 --> 00:45:33.30
But in the end, you know no damage done

702
00:45:33.70 --> 00:45:36.26
There there's some speculation that they were actually decoys

703
00:45:36.26 --> 00:45:39.78
I don't know if you're gonna mention that later, but which it didn't really matter

704
00:45:39.78 --> 00:45:45.78
I mean, no we want to blow the shit out of this day no matter whether it's a decoy or not and that was a long flight haul

705
00:45:45.78 --> 00:45:48.26
I mean that that was a painful flight haul

706
00:45:49.54 --> 00:45:52.90
And of course, you know all your buds what do they think?

707
00:45:52.90 --> 00:45:54.90
Right, oh, yeah, you dorked it up

708
00:45:55.46 --> 00:45:56.98
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

709
00:45:56.98 --> 00:45:59.38
You know you guys screwed it up. What was wrong with the aircraft?

710
00:45:59.70 --> 00:46:04.42
That was just some little technical problem. Yeah, I mean we sort of through this thing together

711
00:46:04.42 --> 00:46:10.90
I mean it hadn't been through rigorous testing or anything like that and and it was an electronic component that was overheating and failing

712
00:46:11.30 --> 00:46:17.06
After being turned on for two hours and we just didn't know because we'd never flown long long missions with it before

713
00:46:17.22 --> 00:46:23.94
We'd always crank up turn it on go shoot work fine, but if you flew for two hours it overheated and didn't work anymore

714
00:46:26.98 --> 00:46:30.42
Eventually you guys did get a scud they talk about that in there

715
00:46:30.42 --> 00:46:33.94
You talk about that in there the war ended

716
00:46:35.86 --> 00:46:40.18
Over pretty quick obviously, but at the same time, you know much like in Panama

717
00:46:41.06 --> 00:46:43.06
You you you he low went down

718
00:46:44.42 --> 00:46:46.98
You lost Mike Anderson and Chuck Cooper

719
00:46:48.66 --> 00:46:50.66
Chris Chapman and

720
00:46:50.66 --> 00:46:58.50
Mario Vega Velazquez and another special operator and they went down lost those guys

721
00:47:01.94 --> 00:47:07.46
You get done with that and then it's redeployed back to America after that one

722
00:47:08.82 --> 00:47:19.62
You got I mean going in the 90s 80s and 90s getting like real world experience in both Panama and then going over to the person golf

723
00:47:19.62 --> 00:47:21.62
That's

724
00:47:21.30 --> 00:47:24.90
That's freaking legit for back then. Oh, it was that's why we were arrogant

725
00:47:26.26 --> 00:47:30.42
I mean that was the unfortunate effect of all that because even in the unit

726
00:47:30.42 --> 00:47:35.46
They were guys that just didn't end up on their on the rotation so they don't have they might have been there 15 years

727
00:47:35.46 --> 00:47:40.26
But they don't have the combat experience that that was painful for a little man. Yeah, I

728
00:47:40.66 --> 00:47:45.38
That's that's a nightmare. Yeah, that's it. I got very very lucky my whole career

729
00:47:45.38 --> 00:47:52.02
I got very lucky my whole career and I always always on the the lucky side not the unlucky side

730
00:47:52.02 --> 00:47:56.18
You know standard round cone. I wish I would have been there for that not including the first goal for which I'm

731
00:47:56.18 --> 00:47:58.18
Mess because I'm still in training

732
00:47:59.94 --> 00:48:02.58
But yeah, that had to be an interesting

733
00:48:03.78 --> 00:48:05.78
dynamic in the locker room

734
00:48:06.18 --> 00:48:10.74
I know the the Vietnam guys so we used to call new guys if you hadn't been on deployment

735
00:48:10.74 --> 00:48:15.46
Then you were new guy and as soon as you went on your first deployment didn't really wear matter where you went

736
00:48:16.18 --> 00:48:18.98
Then you weren't a new guy anymore, but the Vietnam guys

737
00:48:19.62 --> 00:48:25.34
Unless you were in combat you were new guys, so you could have been new guy in their mind for 10 years

738
00:48:25.34 --> 00:48:31.38
Yeah, cherry boy right like they would bring it to some of those old Vietnam guys

739
00:48:34.02 --> 00:48:36.18
All right, I'm gonna fast forward a little bit

740
00:48:36.18 --> 00:48:39.86
Somalia October 3rd

741
00:48:40.18 --> 00:48:42.18
1993

742
00:48:42.18 --> 00:48:48.10
It was a perfect day for prayer a bright and tranquil Sunday morning the skies and seas were polished blue soft winds

743
00:48:48.10 --> 00:48:53.94
Bore civil sea silver edge clouds and the coastal sand's gleamed white like ribbons of salt

744
00:48:54.42 --> 00:48:58.66
It would have been easy to believe it in some sort of heavenly power

745
00:48:59.54 --> 00:49:05.70
But for the most of us in task force ranger the helicopter pilots and our crews the eager young rangers and the

746
00:49:05.70 --> 00:49:12.74
squint-eyed special forces the muscled armors and whiz kid intelligence analysts the all these

747
00:49:13.46 --> 00:49:20.42
mornings in Mogadishu all ran together a Sabbath day felt hardly different than any other bleeding into the workweek

748
00:49:20.82 --> 00:49:25.94
Like the steamy bleached beaut uh, Hughes of the African Vista sure

749
00:49:26.58 --> 00:49:30.74
A few guys knelt before the army chaplain with heads bowed praying for salvation

750
00:49:30.74 --> 00:49:34.74
The rest of us prayed for another mission

751
00:49:36.02 --> 00:49:40.90
How long have you been in Somalia at that point so we get through the end of August so we've been there about six weeks

752
00:49:40.90 --> 00:49:45.70
I mean and and what was your up tempo like pretty heavy?

753
00:49:45.70 --> 00:49:50.34
I mean we flew most of the time we're flying every day every night now wasn't ops every time

754
00:49:50.82 --> 00:49:55.22
We were flying these things called signature flights because we're trying to decensatize the enemy

755
00:49:55.62 --> 00:50:00.34
You know because obviously if you're the bad guys and you're watching your field and a flight of

756
00:50:00.34 --> 00:50:07.86
25 helicopters takes off that's a clue right but if you fly in every day and every night then it they become sort of more

757
00:50:09.54 --> 00:50:15.78
Blivia's to it and that was the theory so and then you know a lot of the operator guys wanted to see the city from the air

758
00:50:16.34 --> 00:50:20.98
And you know the more you fly around an area the more familiar you get so you're more likely to get on target

759
00:50:22.18 --> 00:50:26.58
the way you need to so all that combined meant we were flying just about every day and every night

760
00:50:26.58 --> 00:50:32.10
Going into three October when you how often would you conduct an actual mission like a hit

761
00:50:32.98 --> 00:50:36.10
So October third is is my eighth

762
00:50:37.22 --> 00:50:45.54
Real op in six weeks how often were the guys getting contacted on these previous operations like enemy contact firefight

763
00:50:45.54 --> 00:50:53.62
Someone it started to ramp up you know on the first couple nothing because we had the element of surprise

764
00:50:53.62 --> 00:50:59.38
But after the first few like on I think it's mission five

765
00:51:00.10 --> 00:51:03.70
We're we're trying to capture the number two guy guy name Osmond Otto and

766
00:51:04.58 --> 00:51:06.58
Daytime mission again and

767
00:51:06.58 --> 00:51:10.30
We're going into the compound where he was he was actually there and

768
00:51:10.90 --> 00:51:15.14
RPGs are exploding in the air as we're on the way in and it was enough

769
00:51:16.42 --> 00:51:21.30
Firefighting going on on the ground that we actually didn't go back into the compound to pull the operators out

770
00:51:21.30 --> 00:51:24.98
We went to an alternate pick up zone because it was just too too hot

771
00:51:25.46 --> 00:51:30.70
So you know I would say about halfway into the sequence the the the Somali started to get a little bit more

772
00:51:30.70 --> 00:51:31.70
Bullage rent

773
00:51:31.70 --> 00:51:36.26
You know plus the the big difference is if you had a target two o'clock in the morning you're in and out

774
00:51:36.42 --> 00:51:40.70
You're probably not gonna get a whole lot, but if you go in the daytime when everybody's up and around

775
00:51:41.14 --> 00:51:45.22
That's when you tend to get into a little bit more of a scrape and that's the kind of hot play now

776
00:51:45.42 --> 00:51:47.86
Yeah, I was trying to get a feel for you know

777
00:51:47.86 --> 00:51:51.54
Like I only did a two-to-poilment so I rack but you know my first deployment

778
00:51:52.10 --> 00:51:54.58
obviously those are my first real missions and

779
00:51:56.44 --> 00:52:03.32
Like the mindset of how long it took to where we as a platoon felt like yeah

780
00:52:03.32 --> 00:52:07.88
This is what we're doing sort of like this is our job. This is I don't want to say mechanical

781
00:52:07.88 --> 00:52:13.90
But we just were well rehearsed and we just we were just doing our job and it was like doing any other job

782
00:52:14.50 --> 00:52:15.90
It didn't take that long

783
00:52:15.90 --> 00:52:21.54
You know we because we were doing a lot of operations. We basically go and out almost every night and doing another hit another hit

784
00:52:21.54 --> 00:52:24.66
So you do that five six eight times all right

785
00:52:24.66 --> 00:52:29.46
What's the next target and you kind of getting that mode and it sounds like you were you all were getting getting in that mode

786
00:52:29.46 --> 00:52:31.46
Where this is what we're doing. We know how to do it

787
00:52:32.10 --> 00:52:36.46
Lessons that we're being learned and you make little adjustments and you were there. Yeah, I think we got there pretty quick

788
00:52:36.46 --> 00:52:38.66
Because we'd rehearse quite a bit back at Fort Bragg

789
00:52:38.86 --> 00:52:43.62
I mean we had role players and compounds built and all kinds of stuff for you know

790
00:52:43.62 --> 00:52:50.46
What we thought it was gonna be once we got there some of that was on target. Some of it was not but by the time we actually deployed

791
00:52:50.46 --> 00:52:52.46
We were we had it pretty well down

792
00:52:54.34 --> 00:52:58.70
Fast forward a little bit in the bustling jock the mission was developing very rapidly

793
00:52:58.70 --> 00:53:03.78
We couldn't wait to see if our targets would just hang around drinking tea and bullshitting about women and weather

794
00:53:03.78 --> 00:53:10.82
We couldn't hope to have a CIA asset wander into the target building snap a covert photo of the party and also back out with a

795
00:53:10.82 --> 00:53:15.82
100% confirmation we had to go on information and belief and faith

796
00:53:16.18 --> 00:53:22.70
But in a special ops environment no element leader can afford to be shy about offering solutions or raising dilemmas

797
00:53:22.70 --> 00:53:26.54
I was a combat vampire who loved the night

798
00:53:26.82 --> 00:53:31.46
But I held my piece about the risk of a daylight up because there was no other option

799
00:53:31.78 --> 00:53:37.54
Yet a number of other officers quickly voiced issues to a background score of distant helo turbines

800
00:53:37.54 --> 00:53:45.58
Winding up and desert combat boots thumping across the tarmac like heavy hail sir someone said to General Garrison

801
00:53:45.58 --> 00:53:48.78
I've got some ex-fail issues. What's on your mind?

802
00:53:49.42 --> 00:53:53.46
Okay air expiltration is not an option so we're forced to use the ground convoy

803
00:53:53.94 --> 00:53:57.30
But I think we might wrap it up long before the vehicles are on position

804
00:53:57.70 --> 00:54:03.14
We'll be there when you're ready said Colonel McNight has lightly armored humvies and five ton trucks

805
00:54:03.14 --> 00:54:10.06
We're already assembled to move to a rendezvous point near the Olympic hotel. I wondered if the hotel had a single client this year or ever

806
00:54:11.06 --> 00:54:17.02
But that but the place is nasty with skinis today someone else said using the nickname for hostile semallies

807
00:54:17.46 --> 00:54:19.46
We might get boxed in on the return

808
00:54:20.50 --> 00:54:27.18
Ex-fail by airs a negative another pilot stated firmly the plan called for the helo is to hover it about 30 feet

809
00:54:27.18 --> 00:54:32.54
Uncoil fast ropes and let the de boys and Rangers slide down them like firemen on slick poles

810
00:54:32.86 --> 00:54:35.86
But there was nowhere to land our choppers and pick them up

811
00:54:35.86 --> 00:54:37.90
We could do a rooftop extraction

812
00:54:37.90 --> 00:54:43.98
But like we saw in the last mission hovering up there like sitting ducks makes us very vulnerable to RPG gunners

813
00:54:43.98 --> 00:54:50.94
And there's an antenna tower on the target building an SF officer jabbed at a video monitor with his glove finger

814
00:54:50.94 --> 00:54:54.38
We'd have to blow it before the helo came back in and it'll take time

815
00:54:54.38 --> 00:55:01.10
Don't sweat it boys midnight said to his Ranger officers your convoy will be there and if it's not garrison-grinned

816
00:55:01.10 --> 00:55:06.86
Around his cigar stub the helo's will come in and pull your asses out like they always do and that was it

817
00:55:06.86 --> 00:55:09.10
We've been there for all of 10 minutes

818
00:55:13.26 --> 00:55:18.06
Was this like TST time sensitive target where it came up real quick? Yeah

819
00:55:18.06 --> 00:55:23.58
In fact we were planning a training up we were gonna go shoot because we had the daps there

820
00:55:23.58 --> 00:55:27.62
But we hadn't used them yet and you know ammunition gets all least that's what we told the commander

821
00:55:27.62 --> 00:55:30.70
It's like beer in the fridge you know if you don't consume it it's gonna go bad

822
00:55:30.70 --> 00:55:34.58
So we were gonna do some shooting and that's why I was in the job

823
00:55:35.10 --> 00:55:37.10
We were planning that flight and

824
00:55:38.22 --> 00:55:43.26
This thing developed so fast I actually didn't have time to go back to my bunk and get my knee board

825
00:55:43.26 --> 00:55:47.26
I just went without it because we filmed this thing so many times I didn't need it anyway

826
00:55:47.26 --> 00:55:55.42
But yeah, so from the time we found out that you know these personnel were identified to off off the ground was

827
00:55:56.22 --> 00:56:02.82
Definitely less than an hour maybe 40 minutes to get the whole entourage up and going crank all those birds and brief everybody

828
00:56:02.82 --> 00:56:06.94
I mean it seems like a lot of time. That's not a lot of time at all. Yeah

829
00:56:07.58 --> 00:56:09.58
the

830
00:56:09.58 --> 00:56:16.22
You were the daytime portion of it the fact that you were going out in the day you say you like going out the night

831
00:56:17.26 --> 00:56:20.30
But it was the target that was driving you to do this during the day

832
00:56:20.30 --> 00:56:26.10
They were there you had a pretty good confirmation not a hundred percent like you said in the book, but a pretty decent confirmation and

833
00:56:27.18 --> 00:56:32.10
That's it they're there. We're gonna go get him. Yeah. I mean there was a guy in the ground and he

834
00:56:32.62 --> 00:56:35.62
gave the signal that meant you know positive ID and

835
00:56:35.62 --> 00:56:42.000
And at that point your decision is you know we take the risk and go or we wait and then they move and we lose them and

836
00:56:42.30 --> 00:56:45.70
That's you know that's the commander's decision. I don't I don't question it

837
00:56:45.70 --> 00:56:47.70
I probably would have made the same call

838
00:56:47.70 --> 00:56:55.50
But you know unfortunately it's three o'clock in the afternoon and we can't use the you know the advantage that we have with all of our night vision technology

839
00:56:56.62 --> 00:57:01.18
Yeah, it's a crazy advantage. It's a crazy advantage

840
00:57:01.18 --> 00:57:07.66
I know of we did a lot of daytime operate my my second deployment did a lot of daytime operations

841
00:57:07.66 --> 00:57:12.34
My first deployment we did limited daytime operations for that very reasons we go into a clock in the morning

842
00:57:12.50 --> 00:57:18.02
There's no no no factor no resistance but sometimes same exact thing we'd get hey this guy is here now

843
00:57:18.02 --> 00:57:21.42
In this market and this village and this building we just we would go

844
00:57:21.98 --> 00:57:25.02
So there's there's definitely an elevated risk

845
00:57:25.02 --> 00:57:32.66
During the day and the tactical advantage they have a night at night can't be cannot be understated at all

846
00:57:33.02 --> 00:57:36.14
Right actually there were four risks. I talked about these all the time

847
00:57:37.02 --> 00:57:41.54
Because I was a flight lead so that means I'm I'm I'm actually in the planning

848
00:57:41.54 --> 00:57:46.58
You know and in the final decision making process with the general garrison and all the element commanders and

849
00:57:47.38 --> 00:57:53.10
The four risks at least from a heel perspective identified as as you know for first the foremost daytime

850
00:57:53.10 --> 00:57:59.54
Second one we can't lend the heels like you just talked about so we can we have to fast rope in and we can't do an easy extraction

851
00:57:59.86 --> 00:58:08.10
The third one is that we've done this six times before and the fourth one is it's in the worst part of the city

852
00:58:08.10 --> 00:58:11.94
This is right where all the bad guys hang out they call it the blacksy area

853
00:58:12.10 --> 00:58:17.54
So all four of those things were identified and people asked me because there was a lot of criticism after the fact

854
00:58:17.54 --> 00:58:19.94
You know should have gone shouldn't have gone

855
00:58:19.94 --> 00:58:25.18
But you know when you're in the moment it's it's like often uses a quarterbacks as an example

856
00:58:25.30 --> 00:58:31.94
It's easy to criticize that quarterback for throw that interception, but when you're in the moment and that receivers open and you know

857
00:58:31.94 --> 00:58:34.10
There's a lot on the line this third down

858
00:58:34.10 --> 00:58:37.14
You know you need to touch down bad and you throw that ball

859
00:58:38.18 --> 00:58:42.98
You can't you can't criticize that decision. I mean that decision was made in the moment and you don't know

860
00:58:43.38 --> 00:58:46.22
You know that the receivers gonna fall because he slipped on a

861
00:58:46.22 --> 00:58:52.22
Just like piece of grass, you know you're making a decision based on what you know at the time and and I would never criticize

862
00:58:52.22 --> 00:58:56.82
General Garrison for making that call and I always tell people not of us felt great

863
00:58:57.02 --> 00:59:01.50
But I think we all felt comfortable enough. We went out there saying all right, you know

864
00:59:01.94 --> 00:59:06.46
This is not gonna be probably like most the other ones, but we're we're comfortable enough

865
00:59:06.46 --> 00:59:14.18
And you had done a daytime operation or other daytime operations. Yeah, and so you had thrown those passes before and they were caught by the receiver

866
00:59:14.18 --> 00:59:17.74
Like you intended and hey, we're gonna do it again because we've done it before

867
00:59:20.06 --> 00:59:22.06
hindsight is always 20

868
00:59:24.70 --> 00:59:30.74
And again you got to buy this book because there's there's more details and there obviously I'm not covering the whole thing

869
00:59:30.74 --> 00:59:36.16
I'm fast-moin a little bit here the Rangers and the Delta Force guys being inserted

870
00:59:37.26 --> 00:59:43.98
And here's your perspective. I brought super six for you as low as possible to a 24-hover using a utility pole straight down through the chin

871
00:59:43.98 --> 00:59:50.94
Bubble as my reference ropes. I called over my the intercom my crew chief Tommy Bill echoed me loud and the thick green

872
00:59:50.94 --> 00:59:52.22
Housers were deployed

873
00:59:52.22 --> 00:59:59.26
It was a well-rehearsed routine all I had to do is keep it steady holding the forward left box position with chalk two right behind me

874
00:59:59.26 --> 01:00:02.62
chalk three a beam to the right and chalk four right behind him

875
01:00:03.18 --> 01:00:09.10
But the pilot of the last chopper super six seven had been flying sea two bird until today

876
01:00:09.10 --> 01:00:15.90
Just up there boring holes in the sky and this was his first encounter with the with the brown monster the dust cloud

877
01:00:16.14 --> 01:00:23.22
Most more than a hundred feet high and he felt his way down to it like a waiter tip-towing into an ice cold lake

878
01:00:23.90 --> 01:00:30.20
He deployed his ropes too early and they were 30 only 30 feet long a Ranger went out his door

879
01:00:30.36 --> 01:00:32.98
Lost his grip on the rope and fell into oblivion

880
01:00:32.98 --> 01:00:40.38
It was right there and then that the mission started to unravel like the hem of an old sweater as you tug on one

881
01:00:40.38 --> 01:00:44.62
Loose strand but I didn't know any of that at the time. I was having problems of my own

882
01:00:45.14 --> 01:00:50.42
Right ropes hung up on a wire. It was Bill's voice in my ear dead common steady telling me

883
01:00:50.42 --> 01:00:56.68
We'd snagged on probably the last telephone wire still intact and Mogadissue of all the damn phone lines in the city

884
01:00:56.68 --> 01:01:02.28
I fought forward 10 bill offered a correction as he peered down past as many gun at

885
01:01:02.28 --> 01:01:07.10
At the snare to hauser and I carefully nudged the helo forward

886
01:01:07.48 --> 01:01:14.58
Holdy saying I could tell by his tone that the rope was dangling straight and free and I held it steady while our 18 Rangers

887
01:01:14.58 --> 01:01:16.70
Leap for the lines like comic book heroes

888
01:01:16.70 --> 01:01:25.48
I could hear steals chalk leader barking go go go and the butt plates of M16's and M60 light machine gun scraping and banging against my floor

889
01:01:25.48 --> 01:01:27.96
As the troops dove into the desk dust storm

890
01:01:28.44 --> 01:01:30.92
Within seconds they were all gone

891
01:01:30.92 --> 01:01:37.34
Good luck guys. I whispered as Bill and Tommy trip the releases and the ropes fell from their mounts like limp cobras

892
01:01:37.80 --> 01:01:41.16
None of us had a clue that those young Rangers were in for the fight of their lives

893
01:01:41.40 --> 01:01:47.10
ropes clear Tommy announced and I hauled the helo into a rising left bank as I keep my mic

894
01:01:47.10 --> 01:01:51.76
Super six four is out and that was it. I thought it was over

895
01:01:57.56 --> 01:01:59.56
You go out to a holding pattern now and

896
01:01:59.56 --> 01:02:05.98
Like other operations that you've gone on that's you go out in your holding pattern everyone the boys on the ground do what the boys on the ground do

897
01:02:07.96 --> 01:02:13.84
Didn't take them very long seem did they they were getting the target secured getting the principles

898
01:02:14.44 --> 01:02:18.28
You know taken get them controlled get them blindfolded get them cuffed

899
01:02:19.80 --> 01:02:24.90
That Ranger that had fallen he was critically injured on top of that

900
01:02:25.48 --> 01:02:27.48
You you learn that

901
01:02:27.48 --> 01:02:30.20
He will they weren't near their designated area

902
01:02:31.20 --> 01:02:33.20
Either and I was watching some video

903
01:02:34.60 --> 01:02:38.76
Though that brownout situation was great. I've been in Tana Brownout

904
01:02:38.76 --> 01:02:44.58
I guess it was because it was in the city brownout. Is that what made it worse? Yeah because if you land in the desert

905
01:02:44.96 --> 01:02:48.56
There's a technique that we learn where you almost like land like an airplane

906
01:02:48.56 --> 01:02:52.44
Right you come down and you get a little bit of ground roll and you stay ahead of the cloud

907
01:02:52.44 --> 01:02:55.52
But you can't do that in the city. I mean you're in it. Yeah

908
01:02:55.52 --> 01:03:00.28
So you got to find some kind of reference and like I was talking about my reference was there was a pole right there

909
01:03:00.28 --> 01:03:04.44
And that's about all I could see but at least it was enough to maintain the position

910
01:03:04.44 --> 01:03:08.72
But you know the further back you are in the flight the worst of gets because you got yours and

911
01:03:09.28 --> 01:03:13.24
Everybody else is in front of you that you're dealing with so and that guy's defense

912
01:03:13.24 --> 01:03:20.40
He was he had the worst of it and unfortunately is a little bit inexperienced. Yeah, and in an open desert the the dust has somewhere to go

913
01:03:20.40 --> 01:03:21.52
You know it'll it'll

914
01:03:21.52 --> 01:03:25.60
Expand out to this or expand out to the sides and you could see on these videos

915
01:03:25.60 --> 01:03:30.40
I was watching that dust has nowhere to go. So it's going straight back up in the air. Right. There's the biggest dust clouds

916
01:03:30.40 --> 01:03:35.80
I've seen massive it was it was pretty rough, but we had we had gotten the technique down pretty well at that point

917
01:03:37.04 --> 01:03:39.28
Unfortunately he had had much experience with it

918
01:03:41.88 --> 01:03:45.76
You're in you're now monitoring radius where do you want one net?

919
01:03:45.76 --> 01:03:51.76
We you on monitoring the ground net and the internet was their multiple nets or we wrong one net multiple nets

920
01:03:52.12 --> 01:03:54.12
Yeah, we I always

921
01:03:54.12 --> 01:03:59.64
I make up this phrase but go to helmet fire when things go really crazy and every net is just

922
01:04:00.40 --> 01:04:03.76
You know lid up we've got five radios in our head

923
01:04:04.08 --> 01:04:08.68
So it gets pretty ugly because there's there's a there's a command net. There's air to air net

924
01:04:08.68 --> 01:04:11.08
There's air to ground net. There's a fires net and

925
01:04:11.08 --> 01:04:20.88
And sometimes you can even listen to the tactical commanders net if you want to so that's a lot of stuff to keep track of and and you know as long as there's not much going on

926
01:04:20.88 --> 01:04:23.28
It works. Thanks. Why but wouldn't

927
01:04:23.28 --> 01:04:27.12
Crap starts happening. It gets it gets pretty hard to decipher

928
01:04:27.84 --> 01:04:30.16
I had in my

929
01:04:30.16 --> 01:04:35.40
Plotoons in my task you weren't allowed to talk on the radio like you weren't a lot like everybody knew

930
01:04:35.40 --> 01:04:40.80
They wouldn't say something on the radio unless it was no possible other way of communicating it for this

931
01:04:40.80 --> 01:04:46.12
Very reason because when things will go sideways everyone if they think they can just start talking about what's important them

932
01:04:46.40 --> 01:04:49.52
The nets get cluttered up and then you put five nets of that

933
01:04:51.48 --> 01:04:57.000
It was another one that I would have never thought about before but there's a think all the CEO

934
01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.64
I you know for those who aren't familiar with it would basically

935
01:04:59.64 --> 01:05:03.64
Give you the call signs and frequency and all this stuff so like in the CEO

936
01:05:03.64 --> 01:05:08.80
I your unit would be one designation and then you're rolling that unit would be another let's just say x-ray

937
01:05:08.80 --> 01:05:16.000
6-7 that means that's x-ray unit and 6-7 is the commander. Well in another unit it might be Zulu

938
01:05:16.40 --> 01:05:17.20
6-7

939
01:05:17.20 --> 01:05:22.48
But what people started doing in in in in the chaos was abbreviate

940
01:05:22.84 --> 01:05:28.88
6-7 so which freakin 6-7 is this you know and and it really kind of oh expose the wheat is at least from my perspective

941
01:05:28.88 --> 01:05:32.28
And that's probably not a great way to do this and you know it needs to be

942
01:05:32.80 --> 01:05:35.08
Structured differently and I don't know whether I ever got resolved

943
01:05:35.08 --> 01:05:40.68
But it's the only experience I ever had where people started just abbreviating who they were and you just lost track

944
01:05:40.68 --> 01:05:44.24
Because it's just too much going on yeah and especially pilots

945
01:05:44.36 --> 01:05:49.08
They talk real smooth and quick and fast and they're almost immediately

946
01:05:49.08 --> 01:05:53.48
They'll dump the first part of their call sign when you start talking to them right right that's just habitual for them

947
01:05:53.48 --> 01:05:56.28
We got to get the crew to get their train tables up before you

948
01:05:56.28 --> 01:05:58.28
You got to be able to get it out

949
01:06:02.20 --> 01:06:04.20
Going back to the book

950
01:06:04.20 --> 01:06:08.12
The ex-ville convoy we started to take heavy murderous fire

951
01:06:08.68 --> 01:06:10.68
We've lost a five-ton truck

952
01:06:10.68 --> 01:06:16.12
I heard that and ray and I'd glance at each other the ground transmissions were broken and hard to understand

953
01:06:16.92 --> 01:06:20.84
We switched radios for better reception things were starting to heat up down there

954
01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:24.92
But we just sat there and breathed and flew around and around waiting

955
01:06:24.92 --> 01:06:28.60
I knew Cliff Walcott and his called copilot Donovan Briley

956
01:06:28.60 --> 01:06:35.48
We're back in there with super six one giving fire support from three SF shooters on board and their crew chiefs many guns

957
01:06:35.80 --> 01:06:42.28
From what I could gather as I squinted straining to hear the samallies were coming from every doorway and from behind every wall

958
01:06:42.76 --> 01:06:49.60
But all we could do is sit up there and our safe haven feeling helpless while our people were in deep shit and we knew it

959
01:06:51.88 --> 01:06:54.68
Super six one is going down. It was Cliff's voice

960
01:06:54.68 --> 01:07:00.60
He was talking about himself and his own hero something and hit his bird and he and Donovan were going to crash

961
01:07:00.60 --> 01:07:07.40
I swallowed disbeliefing what I'd heard super six one is going down Cliff Walcott and Donovan Briley were real good friends of mine

962
01:07:07.40 --> 01:07:10.04
We were all from the same platoon. We were close

963
01:07:10.20 --> 01:07:15.28
We'd been together for a long time traveled on the road together party together our families knew each other very well

964
01:07:15.28 --> 01:07:20.24
I shook it off. They'll be all right. I decided that'll have to land maybe a hard landing or something

965
01:07:20.24 --> 01:07:23.52
But the star bird will fly in and pick them up and we'll all go home

966
01:07:23.52 --> 01:07:29.28
The possibility that Cliff and Donovan might die didn't cross my mind. I couldn't see them from my position

967
01:07:29.28 --> 01:07:33.76
So I painted it the way I needed to see it at the moment as it was an RPG

968
01:07:34.24 --> 01:07:37.04
Round had blown a bitch big chunk off their bird

969
01:07:37.20 --> 01:07:43.56
They started spinning out of control while Donovan shut down the engines and Cliff tried to get the aircraft on the ground to one piece

970
01:07:43.88 --> 01:07:48.32
But those damn narrow streets the heelos smack down on a reinforced concrete wall

971
01:07:48.32 --> 01:07:54.28
Pivoted and crashed nose first in those few seconds everything changed the radios

972
01:07:54.28 --> 01:07:58.68
Which up till now at his the occasional code word or updates went crazy?

973
01:07:59.04 --> 01:08:02.04
Sure we'd all prepared for the possibility of a bird going down

974
01:08:02.04 --> 01:08:05.68
But the timing and location were about as bad as they could be

975
01:08:06.08 --> 01:08:10.30
The ground assault element with prisoners already until was order to regrow

976
01:08:10.62 --> 01:08:15.96
Grig group at the fresh crash site the exville convoy suddenly had a new and even more deadly

977
01:08:15.96 --> 01:08:21.92
Labyrinth to fight through air elements were being summoned for support. It was now constant chatter back and forth

978
01:08:21.92 --> 01:08:25.04
The voice is still steady, but ominously urgent

979
01:08:26.32 --> 01:08:32.48
On this mission the worst had happened. We had a bird down and the survivors were surrounded

980
01:08:38.84 --> 01:08:45.000
Are you aware of casualties at this point? I'm not in fact the part that still tough for me to

981
01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:51.32
Process is I did not know that Cliff and Donovan had died until I actually got released from captivity

982
01:08:51.96 --> 01:08:59.48
And I'm laying there in in the field hospital and all the guys come over to see me and I'm looking around

983
01:08:59.48 --> 01:09:03.96
I like where's Cliff and Donovan and the commander start crying. I mean

984
01:09:04.68 --> 01:09:08.96
It was just you don't think you can happen, you know, and you know

985
01:09:08.96 --> 01:09:11.000
I think back to some of the other options you were talking about it

986
01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:15.88
You just look over in their bumps there, you know, and they're not there anymore. It's just it's just

987
01:09:16.68 --> 01:09:18.68
I don't know it's hard it's hard to

988
01:09:19.80 --> 01:09:28.60
It's hard to describe if you haven't lived it, you know, to see the impact that that has and then then you come back and you see their families

989
01:09:28.60 --> 01:09:33.92
You know, we're still in touch. I just saw Donovan's wife and daughter about it. We can have a go and

990
01:09:34.80 --> 01:09:37.80
You know the holes never felt it's gone forever and

991
01:09:37.80 --> 01:09:42.60
Just amazing great Americans and honor to have served them

992
01:09:47.24 --> 01:09:52.52
When you when you compare your mindset at the time clearly you know that things are going bad

993
01:09:53.40 --> 01:09:58.76
Was it possible for you to tell how bad they were going with the with the situation that the ground force was in?

994
01:09:58.76 --> 01:10:00.04
I mean they were getting

995
01:10:00.36 --> 01:10:01.96
smashed

996
01:10:01.96 --> 01:10:03.96
Will you aware of that?

997
01:10:03.96 --> 01:10:11.72
Well, there was a lot of talk on the net, but you know with the bird down that's gonna happen anyway, so and I am a bit of an eternal optimist

998
01:10:11.72 --> 01:10:16.68
And I'm thinking yeah, all right this speed bump, you know, I mean we'll get through this we just got to clean this up

999
01:10:17.40 --> 01:10:23.96
Never in my wildest dreams would have thought that you know Cliff and Donovan had already been killed or the things that were going on on the ground

1000
01:10:23.96 --> 01:10:25.56
The fatalities that already been taken

1001
01:10:25.56 --> 01:10:30.60
There wasn't a lot of talk about losses yet on the radio that I did I had heard anyway

1002
01:10:30.60 --> 01:10:34.12
But you know obviously it ramps up pretty quick here a few minutes

1003
01:10:36.44 --> 01:10:42.44
Going back to the book here kernel math used called me on the net six four I need you to go and take six ones play so over the target

1004
01:10:43.80 --> 01:10:49.88
I was expecting that call the come we had practiced this exact contingency just a few days before the mock shoot down of six one

1005
01:10:49.88 --> 01:10:55.08
And I was rolling in I was rolling out of holding even as I answered Roger six for going in

1006
01:10:55.08 --> 01:11:01.96
Even with everything I knew now my mind's eye flashing me on holy images my hands and feet didn't his

1007
01:11:02.12 --> 01:11:10.20
Hasidate we broke formation known in the helicopter set of word ray Tommy Bill and I all knew what had just happened to our friends

1008
01:11:10.52 --> 01:11:15.24
One bird was down in the city another was hit and the ground force was decisively engaged

1009
01:11:15.24 --> 01:11:20.52
We were playing for keeps on this one. I broke silence on the inner column and make it a little sticky in there

1010
01:11:20.68 --> 01:11:22.68
Let's all keep our heads in the game

1011
01:11:23.08 --> 01:11:24.68
There was no response

1012
01:11:24.68 --> 01:11:28.60
I had it back for the target site at full power running right along the rooftops

1013
01:11:28.60 --> 01:11:32.84
We were going to provide fire support for the ground elements, but I realized that everyone had been

1014
01:11:33.32 --> 01:11:39.16
Told now to consolidate at the crash site platoon squads and sections would be racing door to door toward that new position

1015
01:11:39.16 --> 01:11:42.60
It would be very hard to distinguish friend from foe and such a melee

1016
01:11:44.04 --> 01:11:47.64
We couldn't just cowboy in their spewing 4,000 rounds a minute

1017
01:11:47.80 --> 01:11:53.32
Tommy and Bill's electrically controlled miniguns could be armed only by me throwing a switch in the cockpit

1018
01:11:53.32 --> 01:11:55.32
I spoke to them very carefully

1019
01:11:55.32 --> 01:12:01.000
Okay, I said I'm arming your guns, but we're not doing any shooting until we figure out where everyone is

1020
01:12:01.16 --> 01:12:03.16
Roger that they grunted Raj

1021
01:12:04.36 --> 01:12:13.56
Within seconds we were back over the target area flying a wide circular pattern trying to locate cliffs clad crash site and clearly spot the enemy before we opened up on him

1022
01:12:14.20 --> 01:12:18.68
We were in a hard left bank with me up high in the right seat

1023
01:12:18.68 --> 01:12:26.28
So I was peering past Ray and down into total confusion it was just smoke and dust and indistinguishable sprinting forms

1024
01:12:26.76 --> 01:12:30.28
I tried to raise super six two cliff and dawn of in the wingman

1025
01:12:31.16 --> 01:12:37.40
But the air to air net was jammed up and the AMC kept telling us to vary our pattern and minimize exposure time

1026
01:12:37.96 --> 01:12:43.64
I janked it up and down getting high getting low trying to make us hard to hit all to aware that the

1027
01:12:43.64 --> 01:12:47.96
Somali's were now shooting at us from every rooftop and street corner

1028
01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:54.92
Something slammed into my helicopter and that's where we opened this up

1029
01:12:55.80 --> 01:12:57.80
That's where we started the podcast

1030
01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:11.24
This I was again I was watching some videos the the actual videos and there's freaking Somali's everywhere

1031
01:13:11.24 --> 01:13:19.96
I you because you're seeing different angles and there's just Somali's everywhere and they were just lighting up everyone and everything and all the birds

1032
01:13:22.84 --> 01:13:28.12
What's crazy about this whole thing you know again you have a picture of the map and in this in the book

1033
01:13:28.68 --> 01:13:31.64
It's like a mile away two miles away this whole thing

1034
01:13:32.84 --> 01:13:37.08
Is all I mean you you're out at sea hovering in your safe spot and

1035
01:13:37.08 --> 01:13:39.80
And seconds later you're over the target

1036
01:13:40.52 --> 01:13:45.80
How long we over the target for before before you got hit not long we made it around about three times and you know

1037
01:13:46.12 --> 01:13:49.80
You touched on it but the hard part for us is trying to figure out what's going on on the ground

1038
01:13:49.80 --> 01:13:50.84
I mean you can't just

1039
01:13:50.84 --> 01:13:58.20
hose everybody down right so and and I don't think people can appreciate how hard it is being in a helicopter because

1040
01:13:58.36 --> 01:14:02.04
So I tell them if you want to get some perspective on what this is like

1041
01:14:02.04 --> 01:14:09.24
Go to a big city somewhere and drive down through the heart of town in the middle of the night going 90 miles an hour

1042
01:14:09.48 --> 01:14:13.64
And see how much situational awareness you can get on the side streets as you go by them

1043
01:14:13.72 --> 01:14:18.84
That's essentially the same thing so you can't really tell you didn't get you didn't get a look at it long enough

1044
01:14:18.84 --> 01:14:21.96
Because the angles are constantly changing and you see a person here

1045
01:14:21.96 --> 01:14:25.24
But then by the time you get a chance to figure out is that a threat is that a friendly?

1046
01:14:25.80 --> 01:14:27.96
They're gone. I mean you're you're you're you're past them

1047
01:14:27.96 --> 01:14:33.000
So we you know how long is it take to get around about three times? I don't know maybe two minutes and

1048
01:14:33.80 --> 01:14:38.84
We were not even close to the point where we felt like we could shoot. I mean that's a that weapon, you know

1049
01:14:38.84 --> 01:14:42.76
I'm just gonna tear the place up so we we never fired around I

1050
01:14:44.12 --> 01:14:50.28
Have you been to foul in Nevada flying up there? So I was like a new guy and I was a radio man when I was in

1051
01:14:50.28 --> 01:14:54.60
List of guy and so I was always calling the helos for extract and stuff and I was calling him

1052
01:14:54.60 --> 01:15:02.28
He was it was daytime. I'm calling in helos. We're in foul Nevada. So this is a desert environment. It's open desert and there's some little shrubs

1053
01:15:02.28 --> 01:15:09.16
But not much and I'm calling this helicopter and I'm looking and they are not far away and I have like probably a little

1054
01:15:11.24 --> 01:15:16.12
Three foot or maybe four foot by four foot aircraft panel and so I go hey, you know

1055
01:15:16.12 --> 01:15:20.84
I mark you identify and I'm sitting there looking they they couldn't been more than 200 yards away

1056
01:15:20.84 --> 01:15:28.52
Maybe 300 yards away. It's a freaking giant helicopter. I'm holding up this aircraft panel bright orange

1057
01:15:28.52 --> 01:15:33.40
Aircraft panel for them to see me and they're like we don't see you and I'm thinking about

1058
01:15:33.40 --> 01:15:38.36
What do you get me there's two aircraft? I got a squad of seals out here there's eight seals

1059
01:15:38.36 --> 01:15:43.72
Sure, we're wearing camouflage, but we feel completely naked. I'm thinking if you would have asked me to put money

1060
01:15:43.72 --> 01:15:49.80
I would have bet you know two months pay that this that this these helicopters can see us a hundred

1061
01:15:49.80 --> 01:15:55.08
percent and I'm gonna hold this aircraft panel up they couldn't see us. It is so different when you're up there

1062
01:15:55.64 --> 01:16:01.16
So different when you're up there and we they didn't find that those two helos didn't find us until we popped purple smoke

1063
01:16:01.80 --> 01:16:03.80
And then they will oh yeah, we got you

1064
01:16:04.04 --> 01:16:10.04
It was crazy so what you are seeing when you're in the air and you're moving it's really hard to figure out what's going on down there

1065
01:16:10.04 --> 01:16:11.40
Yeah, it was impossible

1066
01:16:11.40 --> 01:16:15.80
We probably could have orbited for 20 minutes and would have not had full situation awareness

1067
01:16:15.80 --> 01:16:17.80
Would you gotta have because I mean

1068
01:16:17.80 --> 01:16:24.76
You know the the the the fratricide is not acceptable no matter what I mean and when that was our biggest concern

1069
01:16:27.48 --> 01:16:29.48
So you go down

1070
01:16:31.80 --> 01:16:39.08
Fast forward I woke up in the silence of my own grave at least that's what I believed in that first moment because the last flash of

1071
01:16:39.08 --> 01:16:43.56
Consciousness I had clearly seen the clawing hand of the grim reaper

1072
01:16:43.56 --> 01:16:50.36
I did not know where I was I did not know who I was it was like emerging from an altitude chamber with a case of

1073
01:16:50.36 --> 01:16:56.12
Hypocce as my mind begin to stagger slowly through the dark dark and hallways of my concussed brain

1074
01:16:56.68 --> 01:17:00.84
When my eyelids finally flooded open I was stunned to take in light

1075
01:17:01.24 --> 01:17:03.72
The choppers windshield was almost completely gone

1076
01:17:04.04 --> 01:17:08.76
Peerston disintegrated by a slab of corrugated metal that had stopped only inches from my face

1077
01:17:08.76 --> 01:17:15.80
Yet my first sense of emotion wasn't relief but a fury at the disfiguring of my helicopter by that rusty blade

1078
01:17:15.80 --> 01:17:24.92
I reached up to shove the thing from my pocket and then pain swept over me like a wave of molten lava

1079
01:17:25.32 --> 01:17:31.32
My back was broken two of my vertebraids smack together on impact displacing the discs between and

1080
01:17:31.64 --> 01:17:37.72
Polverizing each other every muscle my back must have tried to prevent that catastrophe and been ripped apart in the effort

1081
01:17:37.72 --> 01:17:40.28
And it felt like some evil giant had a grip on me

1082
01:17:40.92 --> 01:17:43.80
I stopped moving and just tried to breathe without passing out

1083
01:17:44.44 --> 01:17:49.56
I sure as hell was fully conscious now although my thoughts and reflexes seemed to trudged through a

1084
01:17:49.80 --> 01:17:56.60
Sort of syrupy fog slowly I moved my aching hand and clenched around the cockpit and found I was sitting level with the floor

1085
01:17:56.92 --> 01:18:02.28
The seats in the blackhawk are designed to stroke downward and a major cross crash and mine had done that and more

1086
01:18:02.28 --> 01:18:06.20
My right leg felt strangely numb and as soon as I tried to move it

1087
01:18:06.20 --> 01:18:13.96
I knew that the femur had broken clean and half over the edge of my Kevlar seat my m9 pistol was still strapped in my right thigh

1088
01:18:14.68 --> 01:18:20.60
And it and it's a way shifted I could feel splintered ends of my bones grinding against one another

1089
01:18:21.32 --> 01:18:25.80
But it didn't hurt all that much my crushed a vertebrae where monopolizing my pain centers

1090
01:18:26.20 --> 01:18:29.32
I was dead sure that I couldn't get myself out of the cockpit

1091
01:18:29.32 --> 01:18:36.76
They blackhawks hard enough to get out of when you're healthy you have to control yourself on maneuvering your limbs around the seat and the controls

1092
01:18:36.76 --> 01:18:44.44
I could barely move I saw my MP5 submachine gun lying on the floor near my left foot where I left it as I reached forward

1093
01:18:44.44 --> 01:18:47.64
I made sure it was cocked and locked and laid it across my lap

1094
01:18:47.64 --> 01:18:55.16
I could hear some thin muffled shouts in the distance the samallies would surely try to overrun us and it looked like I just have to fight it out right there

1095
01:18:55.16 --> 01:18:58.20
Where I sat and then I remembered I wasn't alone

1096
01:18:58.20 --> 01:19:03.24
I looked over at Ray his helmet was gone and he was slowly edging himself off his seat

1097
01:19:03.24 --> 01:19:09.56
Which had collapsed in the floor just like mine the acreed smell of spilled jet fuel mix with dry dust was in the air

1098
01:19:09.56 --> 01:19:14.52
And I heard someone moaning unintelligible from the back of the chopper. It was Bill Cleveland's voice

1099
01:19:14.52 --> 01:19:19.64
But nothing he muttered made any sense. There wasn't a sound from Tommy Field Ray looked at me

1100
01:19:20.68 --> 01:19:22.68
I tried to pull them off

1101
01:19:22.68 --> 01:19:26.04
He meant the injured engines. I know it couldn't do it

1102
01:19:26.04 --> 01:19:30.28
I glanced up at the power control levers. You got him halfway

1103
01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:37.16
He didn't say anything for a moment and then left to be his broken. I think right femur here and and my back too

1104
01:19:37.72 --> 01:19:43.32
Yeah, he said and then he slowly maneuvered himself until he was sitting in the door sill with his back to me

1105
01:19:44.20 --> 01:19:47.24
I'm moving Mike he said I'll be right here

1106
01:19:48.52 --> 01:19:53.000
Ray nodded and then he gripped the sill with his hands and carefully lowered himself to the ground

1107
01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:56.12
I couldn't see him any anymore and I would never see him again

1108
01:19:58.36 --> 01:20:00.52
I knew we were about to be in the battle for our lives

1109
01:20:00.68 --> 01:20:05.96
We were down in the middle of Mogadishu and there was no doubt in my mind that the samallies were coming for us

1110
01:20:14.52 --> 01:20:16.12
You can't

1111
01:20:16.12 --> 01:20:19.16
There's no way for you to get out of the helicopter at this point. No

1112
01:20:19.16 --> 01:20:27.48
It's like it's that you know to get in and out of about 60 you got a got a twist and bend and you know sling your leg over the cyclic and

1113
01:20:28.04 --> 01:20:35.000
I can't and there's just no way so I decided I'm gonna fight it out from right there and your femurs broken your back is

1114
01:20:35.80 --> 01:20:37.80
totally jacked up

1115
01:20:37.80 --> 01:20:48.68
Can you hear some alleyes in the distance? No, it was you know what I think when you aircraft first hit

1116
01:20:49.56 --> 01:20:52.04
Obviously quite the event in this neighborhood

1117
01:20:52.36 --> 01:20:58.68
You know there's 20,000 pound machine crashes from the sky so I think they all ran initially and then you know over time

1118
01:20:58.68 --> 01:21:00.68
They started to kind of

1119
01:21:00.84 --> 01:21:04.28
Sneak their way back in trying to figure out what was going on. Did you know where you were?

1120
01:21:04.28 --> 01:21:09.56
Generally but I mean if you know if you'd ask me at that moment put my finger on a map I

1121
01:21:10.12 --> 01:21:12.12
Wouldn't have gotten all that close. I don't think

1122
01:21:17.96 --> 01:21:20.12
Fast forward a little bit just then

1123
01:21:20.60 --> 01:21:23.88
Randy Schuckart and Gary Gordon appeared on the right side of our chopper

1124
01:21:24.20 --> 01:21:27.96
They would delta operators and although I didn't know them personally or by name

1125
01:21:27.96 --> 01:21:29.64
I certainly knew who they were

1126
01:21:29.64 --> 01:21:34.20
More than once I'd brief them and the other members of their teams prior to assaults in the city

1127
01:21:34.84 --> 01:21:41.56
Since they were wearing no helmets I recognize them instantly Randy was carrying a high-tech sniper rifle and Gary had a car 15

1128
01:21:41.80 --> 01:21:48.12
The short-barled version of the M16 assault rifle and their load bearing harnesses were slung with ammunition and grenades

1129
01:21:49.32 --> 01:21:54.76
Brandy and Gary didn't say very much. They knew the situation was critical and they were there to work not chat

1130
01:21:55.32 --> 01:21:56.92
They asked me about my injuries

1131
01:21:56.92 --> 01:22:00.28
Well my like my right legs broke and I said and I think my back

1132
01:22:00.28 --> 01:22:01.08
Uh-huh

1133
01:22:01.08 --> 01:22:04.20
They nodded and set themselves in position to lift me out of the cockpit

1134
01:22:04.76 --> 01:22:06.76
They raised me up gently

1135
01:22:07.40 --> 01:22:12.84
So they take you they carry you out of the cockpit and put you in a in a position

1136
01:22:15.24 --> 01:22:17.24
Where you're gonna have to stay because you can't move

1137
01:22:20.52 --> 01:22:26.12
You say super six four sat in the pale dirt. It's belly smeared in the ground. It's big rotors dead still

1138
01:22:26.12 --> 01:22:31.24
And drooping like wilted palm fronds. I couldn't see anyone in the cargo bay Tommy

1139
01:22:31.48 --> 01:22:35.80
Tommy fields minigun it's swung around hard and struck him full in the chest upon impact

1140
01:22:35.96 --> 01:22:39.24
It was a very heavy weapon and crushed his entire rib cage

1141
01:22:40.84 --> 01:22:48.12
Something else inside the chopper had torn up build Cleveland really bad just in front of them and to my right was a long shack and a large tree

1142
01:22:48.28 --> 01:22:51.64
It's high leaves rustling in the hot wind and throwing some shade into me

1143
01:22:51.64 --> 01:22:58.04
The only open area was between between me that shack and my heel

1144
01:22:58.60 --> 01:23:03.08
My heel is cockpit a clear field of fire Randy and Gary knew what they were doing

1145
01:23:03.56 --> 01:23:10.36
They handed me my MP5 and the single spare magazine a total of 60 rounds of 9 millimeter ammo

1146
01:23:10.76 --> 01:23:15.08
But they didn't say a word as they walked off around the nose of the helicopter

1147
01:23:15.08 --> 01:23:17.08
I

1148
01:23:18.92 --> 01:23:25.40
Her bills voice again and twisted my head around shoe cart Gordon had placed him on the ground behind me

1149
01:23:26.44 --> 01:23:28.44
He was still in coherent and great pain

1150
01:23:29.24 --> 01:23:32.36
Some of his flight gear had been removed and his trousers were soaked in blood

1151
01:23:35.24 --> 01:23:38.68
I suddenly missed my family very much especially my young son Joey

1152
01:23:38.68 --> 01:23:45.80
I did not want to die here and even as I fought it the fear began to well up. I was badly injured and scared

1153
01:23:45.80 --> 01:23:50.68
And there was no doubt about it. I did not want to fall in the hands of the samallies just a few weeks before

1154
01:23:50.76 --> 01:23:56.28
They'd overrun some Nigerian troops and rumors about what they had done to them were too gruesome to believe

1155
01:23:57.16 --> 01:24:02.52
And the samallies had done that to fellow Africans so I couldn't even imagine what they might do to us

1156
01:24:02.52 --> 01:24:07.08
The image of mutilation that flashed into my mind terrified me

1157
01:24:10.60 --> 01:24:15.000
Randy and Gary came back around the nose the helo. I wasn't sure what they were doing but they is suit

1158
01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:18.92
But I assumed they were looking for an area large enough to land an aircraft and get us out of there

1159
01:24:19.08 --> 01:24:23.96
They were common deliberate talking to each other like a couple of surveyors planning a new parking lot

1160
01:24:24.36 --> 01:24:26.36
But I knew they were frustrated

1161
01:24:26.36 --> 01:24:32.68
They had four badly injured men on their hands and it was impossible to move even a short distance

1162
01:24:39.16 --> 01:24:43.08
So there's a little calm almost before the storm at this juncture. There is

1163
01:24:44.12 --> 01:24:48.84
Again, I don't think the small is hadn't organized yet. They were still just kind of coming back in ones

1164
01:24:48.84 --> 01:24:51.16
He Tuesdays and I think that people that lived in that area

1165
01:24:51.16 --> 01:24:56.04
It may not have been you know part of the hobby we get our clan or we're in armed

1166
01:24:56.36 --> 01:25:03.000
They just had to live there but once we're got out that there was an aircraft down that was lightly defended and surrounded

1167
01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.96
Then they got an organized group to come that way

1168
01:25:11.56 --> 01:25:15.48
You say from the other side of the tin wall to my right I heard a small eat I heard some molly voices

1169
01:25:15.48 --> 01:25:18.68
It sounded like they were trying to get out of us, but I didn't think you know

1170
01:25:18.68 --> 01:25:26.28
But I didn't think it over for more than a second my MP5 was set on single shop mode and I put it to use firing four quick rounds right through the wall

1171
01:25:26.84 --> 01:25:28.84
I didn't hear the voices anymore

1172
01:25:28.84 --> 01:25:35.40
When I stopped shooting Randy and Gary looked at me as if surprised that a badly injured chopper pilot might actually be used

1173
01:25:35.48 --> 01:25:36.28
Fwant a firefight

1174
01:25:36.28 --> 01:25:40.76
They didn't speak but they moved around to the front of the heel again until they were out of sight

1175
01:25:43.32 --> 01:25:47.08
And now things start to build and you you know you detailed this in the book

1176
01:25:47.08 --> 01:25:51.96
You start here in more AK fire on top of the AK fire you also hear double taps

1177
01:25:52.68 --> 01:25:57.24
From Randy and Gary as they're engaged in these enemy fighters

1178
01:25:58.92 --> 01:26:03.88
Your firing fire through the wall you got your gun starts jamming from time to time

1179
01:26:05.96 --> 01:26:07.96
You actually emptied your first magazine

1180
01:26:07.96 --> 01:26:16.04
I mean get your other magazine in you fire in at these people that are approaching you approaching the helicopter

1181
01:26:18.92 --> 01:26:22.76
You talk about your weapon the thing was stressing me out and it fired just fine at the range

1182
01:26:22.76 --> 01:26:25.16
But it was clear the damn gun needed a good cleaning

1183
01:26:25.16 --> 01:26:30.12
I couldn't claim that I had had time for some basic that I hadn't had time for some basic maintenance

1184
01:26:30.12 --> 01:26:35.32
And I could hear the ghostly echoes of so many drill instructors keep your goddamn weapon clean

1185
01:26:35.32 --> 01:26:37.32
MP-fives are like

1186
01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:46.12
So reliable too. Yeah, I don't think it was it must have been jacked up for landing. I'm not sure

1187
01:26:46.52 --> 01:26:49.80
But pretty frustrating when you know that's the only thing you got

1188
01:26:51.64 --> 01:26:56.52
Could have been your magazines too. Yeah, sometimes if your magazines are messed up like they won't feed properly

1189
01:26:58.04 --> 01:27:00.76
You know I hadn't thought about that maybe just the impact itself

1190
01:27:00.76 --> 01:27:01.64
You know

1191
01:27:01.64 --> 01:27:07.72
Dislauged the bullets or something or messed up the spraying or who knows what MP-fives are so reliable

1192
01:27:08.68 --> 01:27:16.36
I've shot thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of rounds and sometimes we would just purposely not clean them to see if they would ever jam

1193
01:27:16.52 --> 01:27:19.56
They didn't ever would jam a bet your weapon got jacked up

1194
01:27:20.68 --> 01:27:24.12
So you don't have to feel guilty about your drone instructors. Oh, I feel better now

1195
01:27:24.12 --> 01:27:26.12
Okay

1196
01:27:29.80 --> 01:27:33.64
Because it was just sitting there. It wasn't it wasn't in any kind of malnour anything. It just

1197
01:27:34.60 --> 01:27:37.88
Amazing getting fly out of the aircraft actually. I just had it sitting on the floor

1198
01:27:41.64 --> 01:27:44.28
You get some grenades go get a grenade thrown at you

1199
01:27:45.08 --> 01:27:49.32
You say it first I've been happy just to survive the crash then I accepted that I'd fight to the death

1200
01:27:49.32 --> 01:27:54.36
Then swell devolation at that promise of rescue now we were taking heavy fire

1201
01:27:54.52 --> 01:27:58.68
We'd almost been overrun and they were throwing goddamn grenades in here

1202
01:27:58.68 --> 01:28:05.96
I was dripping with sweat pain half paralyzed and out of ammo the stench spilled the stench of spilled jet fuel and gun smoke and rotting garbage

1203
01:28:07.96 --> 01:28:11.40
Or the oh would be my only escorts to my death

1204
01:28:11.72 --> 01:28:16.84
Randy and Gary were out there somewhere on the other side of the chopper desperately trying to hold off the engines

1205
01:28:16.84 --> 01:28:24.28
The burst of AK fire was starting to roll together like a thunder storm. I was alone. It was turning into the freaking alamo

1206
01:28:25.72 --> 01:28:27.72
Damn I'm hit

1207
01:28:27.72 --> 01:28:31.72
He was Gary's voice from the other side of the chopper a Somali bullet had found him yet

1208
01:28:31.72 --> 01:28:39.40
He wasn't so much as what he said but how he'd said it. He sounded almost irritated like this was just going to make things harder for him

1209
01:28:39.40 --> 01:28:44.60
It wasn't a scream or a plea just a statement of fact like someone who'd nicked himself with a vegetable knife

1210
01:28:44.60 --> 01:28:49.96
At that point I'm sure he realized how desperate our situation had become

1211
01:28:51.08 --> 01:28:53.08
No one was coming for us

1212
01:28:58.44 --> 01:29:04.76
Yeah, I mean because of your sort of awareness of the whole situation

1213
01:29:06.68 --> 01:29:13.000
You had some thought in your mind that hey look, I mean we crashed the the the Kazovak bird will be in here soon

1214
01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:16.44
The ground force will be someone will be okay. We just got to hold him off for a little bit

1215
01:29:19.16 --> 01:29:23.48
And that wasn't the reality the reality with everything that was going on you guys were on your own

1216
01:29:24.04 --> 01:29:29.88
Yeah, because this the search of risky bird already been shot out and we had asked for a tank actually

1217
01:29:29.88 --> 01:29:32.52
Because as you mentioned we're only two miles from the airfield

1218
01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:39.32
So our thought was if we have a tank it can get out there and and do extractions is just as well better than a helicopter

1219
01:29:39.32 --> 01:29:44.68
And it's one of the things that I always you know stress when I talk about this at the macro level

1220
01:29:45.24 --> 01:29:51.64
That was denied but at the secretary of defense level and you know first of all secretary defense should be making decisions like that

1221
01:29:51.64 --> 01:29:54.20
But it was it was based on political reasons

1222
01:29:54.44 --> 01:30:01.16
They didn't want to throw more assets into a place that you know they've been advertising you know was basically wrapping up and

1223
01:30:01.64 --> 01:30:03.64
Put basically hung us all out to dry

1224
01:30:03.64 --> 01:30:10.76
Yeah, just in case anyone's wondering a tank can go through that area with absolutely no factor whatsoever, right?

1225
01:30:10.76 --> 01:30:15.64
I mean, this is just small arms and RPGs that's no factor at all. Pounds right off. Yep

1226
01:30:21.64 --> 01:30:25.56
Only minutes before Randy and Gary jumped from a hovering helicopter rescue us

1227
01:30:26.12 --> 01:30:31.40
They had fought their way through a maze of paths and shanties driving off seemless seemingly countless

1228
01:30:31.40 --> 01:30:39.96
Somali gunmen they'd already done more than any two men could be expected to do they put their own lives on the line to try and help their fellow American soldiers

1229
01:30:41.80 --> 01:30:47.96
Gary Gordon died on the other side of that helicopter. I don't know exactly when and I don't know exactly how but I never saw her

1230
01:30:48.28 --> 01:30:49.80
him again

1231
01:30:49.96 --> 01:30:51.96
He died before I even learned his name

1232
01:30:53.64 --> 01:30:55.64
I will never forget him

1233
01:30:56.04 --> 01:30:58.76
Randy Schuukart came back around the cockpit

1234
01:30:58.76 --> 01:31:03.16
Striding toward me and showing little more than professional concern in his expression

1235
01:31:04.04 --> 01:31:05.80
They're throwing grenades in here. I told him

1236
01:31:06.12 --> 01:31:12.20
But he didn't seem to worry about that. He was focused on our critical shortage of ammo and he looked at my now uses mp5

1237
01:31:12.20 --> 01:31:14.36
Are the other weapons in the aircraft he asked

1238
01:31:15.08 --> 01:31:17.40
By crew chiefs keep their own sixteenths in between the seats

1239
01:31:18.20 --> 01:31:22.44
He went off to helicopter without a word climbed in and started digging around moments later

1240
01:31:22.44 --> 01:31:26.76
He returned carrying the longer m16 and a car 15 the short-billed submachine gun

1241
01:31:26.76 --> 01:31:28.76
I'd seen in Gary's hands

1242
01:31:29.16 --> 01:31:33.96
He handed me the smaller weapon and for some reason it felt much better in my grip than my own mp5

1243
01:31:34.60 --> 01:31:37.72
He held up a PRC 112 survival radio

1244
01:31:38.52 --> 01:31:40.52
What channels a fire net on?

1245
01:31:40.52 --> 01:31:42.52
It was odd he didn't even have to shout

1246
01:31:42.52 --> 01:31:48.92
There was gunfire echoing from the far side of the aircraft but in hesitant ones and two's channel bravo I replied

1247
01:31:48.92 --> 01:31:56.60
Randy made a call on the fire support net which gave him a direct line to little bird guns and fire support officer

1248
01:31:57.24 --> 01:31:59.24
A little bird was flying high over our position

1249
01:32:00.76 --> 01:32:06.20
A reaction forces and route came the return call from one of the helicopters the voice sounded familiar

1250
01:32:06.92 --> 01:32:09.64
I was sure it was one of the little bird pilots named Chris

1251
01:32:10.36 --> 01:32:15.96
Now that was encouraging all we had to do was hold out a little bit longer. We needed help, but it was on the way

1252
01:32:15.96 --> 01:32:20.92
We just got to keep them from overrunning us. We got to hang in there just a little bit more

1253
01:32:23.08 --> 01:32:29.000
Randy probably knew right then and there that a little while more would not be soon enough

1254
01:32:29.64 --> 01:32:32.92
He squinted out the radio stuff that into his combat harness

1255
01:32:33.16 --> 01:32:36.36
Hefted his weapon and moved off around the nose and the helicopter

1256
01:32:37.80 --> 01:32:39.80
He left without saying another word

1257
01:32:39.80 --> 01:32:46.36
I would never see him again

1258
01:32:50.04 --> 01:32:52.04
So that's

1259
01:32:56.28 --> 01:32:59.96
Master Sergeant Gordon Gary Gordon you know

1260
01:32:59.96 --> 01:33:06.52
Received a metal of honor

1261
01:33:11.56 --> 01:33:16.76
For his actions that day and also Sergeant first class sugar

1262
01:33:19.08 --> 01:33:22.12
And both those guys you know when you read their their citations

1263
01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.000
They requested

1264
01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:30.52
Multiple times to be able to go in to your position and

1265
01:33:31.40 --> 01:33:33.40
Try and help the situation that was on the ground

1266
01:33:35.80 --> 01:33:42.52
They got the Nied they got the Nied and finally they got permission to go in and do whatever they could

1267
01:33:43.80 --> 01:33:51.64
And you know I can you know we already talked about what things look like from the air and you can only imagine

1268
01:33:51.64 --> 01:33:53.64
Um

1269
01:33:53.96 --> 01:34:00.04
You know actually that these guys knew exactly what they were getting into they knew the situation they were going into

1270
01:34:00.44 --> 01:34:02.44
They knew the risks that they were taking

1271
01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:06.28
They knew that no one was gonna be able to get in there besides them

1272
01:34:06.52 --> 01:34:11.88
They had much better situational awareness than you did because they were up there watching it

1273
01:34:13.48 --> 01:34:15.48
And yet

1274
01:34:15.48 --> 01:34:23.48
They still Rogered up and went in there

1275
01:34:28.84 --> 01:34:31.32
It's the most selfless act I've ever

1276
01:34:32.52 --> 01:34:36.52
Certainly ever witnessed probably the most selfless I ever heard up

1277
01:34:37.24 --> 01:34:39.24
Because it's a little bit different

1278
01:34:39.80 --> 01:34:43.32
To be told to go in versus you know the way it went down

1279
01:34:43.32 --> 01:34:48.84
I mean as I understand and of course I'm on the ground so I don't I don't know I don't didn't hear this personally

1280
01:34:49.32 --> 01:34:53.24
But as I understand it you know, I mean garrison himself said no you're not going it

1281
01:34:53.88 --> 01:34:58.84
And then they finally got directly on the radio and said he looks or if you don't let us in these guys are gone

1282
01:34:59.80 --> 01:35:03.72
And after two or three different conversations like that he said all right put him in and

1283
01:35:06.28 --> 01:35:08.28
You know I

1284
01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:12.28
I just you know you think about if that was you

1285
01:35:12.28 --> 01:35:15.56
When I don't mean you but I just in general terms

1286
01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:21.64
Would you be that committed to your comrades to to go into that situation?

1287
01:35:22.44 --> 01:35:28.52
I don't think you never say you do what you wouldn't you know, but they did it and they did it without hesitation and I think they did

1288
01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:35.000
insist in on it for you know the rest of the mission if if he hadn't finally said yes and they're

1289
01:35:36.28 --> 01:35:38.28
Absolutely deserving of the melalar

1290
01:35:38.28 --> 01:35:44.92
We just did a a memorial dedication for for Gary Gordon this past fall actually in his own town of Lincoln main

1291
01:35:45.56 --> 01:35:52.68
And again, it's another example of when you see the family and you realize you know how what an impact losing

1292
01:35:52.84 --> 01:36:00.52
Someone like that has had on that old town actually and and his family you you understand what these sacrifices really mean

1293
01:36:00.52 --> 01:36:02.52
They're just

1294
01:36:02.52 --> 01:36:05.24
It's it's impossible to describe and

1295
01:36:05.24 --> 01:36:11.16
And I mean it when I say I wouldn't be here without those two guys. Let me know question and there's no doubt about that

1296
01:36:20.52 --> 01:36:22.52
Going back to the book here

1297
01:36:22.84 --> 01:36:26.04
You say suddenly it grew very very quiet up until this point

1298
01:36:26.60 --> 01:36:28.84
There had been quite a bit of gunfire

1299
01:36:28.84 --> 01:36:34.92
Ebing and flowing and volume some from us and from some from them, but for some reason it all stopped for a few moments

1300
01:36:35.24 --> 01:36:37.08
Maybe they've given up I told myself

1301
01:36:37.08 --> 01:36:40.68
I could hear my own lungs raspin at the air like sandpaper on plywood

1302
01:36:40.92 --> 01:36:43.40
Maybe the reaction forces coming in driving them away

1303
01:36:43.40 --> 01:36:49.24
I had no idea of this might be true, but my fantasy was encouraging my mind worked hard to suppress the rising panic

1304
01:36:49.32 --> 01:36:54.68
But my thoughts weren't remotely clear or focused. I couldn't move. I couldn't hide. I couldn't make myself invisible

1305
01:36:54.68 --> 01:37:00.84
My body jerked and clenched and I clenched my fist as a huge volume of gunfire

1306
01:37:01.08 --> 01:37:02.76
Shud suddenly shattered the silence

1307
01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:08.60
It came from the far side of the chopper and it rolled in like a hurricane of the worst sounds that Satan could conjure

1308
01:37:09.16 --> 01:37:14.68
Valleys of AK47 fire hammered at our helpless bird echoing off the cluster channies

1309
01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:18.68
The heavy rounds piercing the chopper steel skin and ricocheting everywhere

1310
01:37:18.68 --> 01:37:24.28
The only thing armored on that black hawk where the seats and I watched helpless and horrified as it was

1311
01:37:24.28 --> 01:37:29.16
Punctured over and over again and it buckled like a down elephant under a hail of poachrifier

1312
01:37:29.72 --> 01:37:34.92
Flying bullets plucked shorn metal and glass into the air and kicked up clots of doored all around me

1313
01:37:34.92 --> 01:37:40.60
It went on for maybe an entire minute a short span of time that's stretching to an agonizing eternity

1314
01:37:40.60 --> 01:37:43.64
I couldn't see anything through the Hulk of the smash chopper

1315
01:37:43.64 --> 01:37:50.60
So I can't say for sure, but Randy Schukegar was probably the only American left fighting over there alone against a countless number of enemies

1316
01:37:50.84 --> 01:37:52.20
He couldn't fight them all

1317
01:37:52.20 --> 01:37:57.24
There's only matter of time before he went down and when Randy finally fell the shooting stopped

1318
01:37:58.04 --> 01:38:01.64
The last valleys of gunfire echoed off the sparse trees

1319
01:38:04.68 --> 01:38:11.16
Then the most terrifying minutes of my entire life began. I doubt there's a more horrific thing one could experience

1320
01:38:11.40 --> 01:38:19.000
I still lie in bed at night and feel the flood of suffocating anxiety time seemed to stand absolutely still my skin crawled

1321
01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:21.96
And every vein in my body throbbed with terror

1322
01:38:23.64 --> 01:38:27.88
What did they really do to those Nigerians? I couldn't move. I could barely breathe

1323
01:38:28.20 --> 01:38:33.32
How much pain can a man endure before his mind shuts down and retreats into the sanctuary of unconsciousness?

1324
01:38:33.32 --> 01:38:38.92
I knew they were going to kill me. I just didn't know how death was on its way. I could hear it

1325
01:38:40.12 --> 01:38:43.96
They were a mob of hate filled men and women and I couldn't see them yet

1326
01:38:43.96 --> 01:38:49.72
But their voices grew louder and louder yelling and screaming and the sound that really made my blood run was the

1327
01:38:49.96 --> 01:38:54.12
Clatter of debris being thrown out of the way as they advanced. It was like

1328
01:38:55.24 --> 01:39:00.68
Some multi-limbed hydra stomping toward me thundering on the ground and furiously tossing away

1329
01:39:00.68 --> 01:39:02.68
Shards of metal and wood as a drew near

1330
01:39:03.32 --> 01:39:11.24
It was the sound of approaching death just overwhelmingly terrifying and I knew that as soon as they came across the nose of that helicopter and saw me

1331
01:39:11.24 --> 01:39:15.24
They were going to chop me to pieces that's what they had done to the Nigerians

1332
01:39:15.40 --> 01:39:17.40
That's what they did to everybody

1333
01:39:17.40 --> 01:39:21.88
We had heard I witnessed accounts of them playing soccer with the skulls of their enemies

1334
01:39:22.84 --> 01:39:28.20
The howling racket of the mob's rage grew louder and louder and I knew there was absolutely nothing

1335
01:39:28.20 --> 01:39:30.20
I could do to save myself

1336
01:39:35.40 --> 01:39:39.96
You had to be so 100% sure you were about to die. Yeah, I still remember the cloud

1337
01:39:39.96 --> 01:39:44.20
There was a cloud going over and I just looked up at it and I thought you know

1338
01:39:44.60 --> 01:39:46.60
Does it it's absolutely over?

1339
01:39:46.60 --> 01:39:52.52
You know, there's no scenario here that you could think of that ends up in survival

1340
01:39:54.84 --> 01:40:00.44
Yeah, they're let the thing that you're talking about with Nigerians that they had overrun a position and just

1341
01:40:00.44 --> 01:40:14.28
Just murdered and butcher these Nigerians. Yeah, they took no prisoners out of everything. I could think of no other course of action

1342
01:40:14.28 --> 01:40:20.36
I put the empty went weapon across my chest place my hands my open hands on top of it and stared up at the hazy blue sky

1343
01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:23.000
In seconds the semalees would come for me

1344
01:40:23.32 --> 01:40:28.68
Not an organized military enemy, but a mob of enraged civilians and militia with only one thing on their minds

1345
01:40:28.68 --> 01:40:34.12
Vengeance a few clouds drifted by overhead that will know helicopters in sight

1346
01:40:34.68 --> 01:40:39.72
I heard the rising victorious cries of the as the semalees swarmed around super six four

1347
01:40:40.12 --> 01:40:46.04
Bountings of hundreds of fists against her battered hide a rattle like swarm of feeding locus

1348
01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:54.52
I did not sob I did not pray no tears coursed down my cheeks for me and that one frozen moment in time

1349
01:40:54.52 --> 01:40:57.80
All that I could do was wait for their arrival

1350
01:40:59.72 --> 01:41:01.72
My Joey will never know his father

1351
01:41:12.36 --> 01:41:15.16
So surprisingly when they get to you

1352
01:41:15.16 --> 01:41:22.20
um well they they they grab and they start they start beating you and they start

1353
01:41:23.24 --> 01:41:25.64
Assulting you but you don't get killed immediately

1354
01:41:26.92 --> 01:41:29.72
You say I can't remember how many times they struck or club me

1355
01:41:29.72 --> 01:41:34.92
But it was many many times a snarling face bent in and a man ripped the green badge news from

1356
01:41:34.92 --> 01:41:41.24
Cored from around my neck that badge gave me access to task force Ranger compound and taped the back of it was my military

1357
01:41:41.24 --> 01:41:46.52
Identification my metal dog tags went with it and as soon as he saw the green badge in his hand

1358
01:41:46.60 --> 01:41:51.96
He stuck it in my face and shouted Ranger Ranger you die Somalia

1359
01:41:53.64 --> 01:41:59.32
His scream curled my blood, but it shocked me even more that this man could know so much about our security and our procedures

1360
01:41:59.56 --> 01:42:02.36
There was nothing on that green badge but a number

1361
01:42:02.36 --> 01:42:05.56
I wondered how many of these were now hanging around the next of our enemies

1362
01:42:05.96 --> 01:42:09.16
But I didn't wonder for long because two men began to work on my boots

1363
01:42:09.16 --> 01:42:14.28
They barely tore the laces open before bracing their feet in the dirt and twisting and pulling

1364
01:42:14.28 --> 01:42:19.48
I watched them tear my left boot off. I closed my eyes when they went for the right the pain of my broken

1365
01:42:19.48 --> 01:42:22.28
Femur shot up through my shattered spine like a high voltage

1366
01:42:22.52 --> 01:42:26.44
Electricution I looked up as a man raised something high above his head

1367
01:42:27.56 --> 01:42:35.40
For a second the son haloed around the object and then he swung it down on me like a club it smashed into my face breaking my right eye socket and cheekbone

1368
01:42:35.40 --> 01:42:41.56
For many years I have held my piece for the sake of the survivors the men who were killed

1369
01:42:42.20 --> 01:42:45.64
Not refuting the can't claim that I was struck with the butt of a rifle

1370
01:42:46.52 --> 01:42:50.44
But the truth is long overdue that object was not a rifle

1371
01:42:51.32 --> 01:42:53.32
It was soft and very heavy

1372
01:42:53.64 --> 01:42:56.28
It was the severed arms of one of my comrades

1373
01:42:56.28 --> 01:43:06.44
I did not cry out or try to defend myself my assailant was poised for another blow and obviously preparing to beat me to death

1374
01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:12.84
But I stared into his eyes with such hatred and defiance and discussed that he froze back to way and dropped his club

1375
01:43:15.08 --> 01:43:19.32
Someone fired a shot in the air it didn't exactly bring things under control

1376
01:43:19.88 --> 01:43:23.32
But it must have stilled the bloodless that was surging through the savage crowd

1377
01:43:23.32 --> 01:43:30.92
Someone threw a handful of dirt in my eyes and mouth the grip blinded me and I choked and sputtered grip from my throat

1378
01:43:31.24 --> 01:43:33.48
Someone else wrapped a filthy rag around my head

1379
01:43:33.72 --> 01:43:40.12
I felt many hands clutching out my legs and shoulders and then they hoisted me high up in the air my crushed vertebrae hard

1380
01:43:40.60 --> 01:43:46.92
Ground hard against each other as they stretched me out like a prisoner on the rack my broken femur cleaved into the back of my leg

1381
01:43:46.92 --> 01:43:54.20
The sharp bone puncturing right out through my skin I

1382
01:43:54.52 --> 01:44:02.84
Left my body the human mind has some defensive talents that only the dying or near dead can relay and mine took me to a place

1383
01:44:03.32 --> 01:44:05.32
High above my tortured form

1384
01:44:05.32 --> 01:44:09.80
I looked down on myself and the surging hard watching it all in perfect detail

1385
01:44:09.80 --> 01:44:18.12
The sea of howling triumpment in humanity and those thousands of hands passing me off like a bloody sacrifice to their unholy gods

1386
01:44:19.72 --> 01:44:23.96
For those brief moments pain was swept away and then so was I

1387
01:44:30.84 --> 01:44:33.64
So now you know I haven't read this at a long time yeah

1388
01:44:33.64 --> 01:44:39.64
Man

1389
01:44:42.12 --> 01:44:44.12
The um

1390
01:44:44.12 --> 01:44:46.12
This whole thing is

1391
01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:52.84
What's weird is about this as you think about it take a step back like the proximity of everything that's happening

1392
01:44:52.84 --> 01:44:56.04
The fact that the airfields of my all away the fact that you were

1393
01:44:56.84 --> 01:44:58.84
Flying around that whatever

1394
01:44:58.84 --> 01:45:05.96
Four thousand feet in complete safety two minutes later or 30 seconds later you're over the target two minutes later

1395
01:45:05.96 --> 01:45:11.56
Your shop down this is all just and it's all happening in this compressed time and compressed space and

1396
01:45:13.72 --> 01:45:16.20
And despite the fact that there's

1397
01:45:16.84 --> 01:45:19.32
Tanks nearby there's troops nearby

1398
01:45:19.96 --> 01:45:21.96
You're you end up completely by yourself

1399
01:45:22.92 --> 01:45:26.68
And that thought cross my mind I made I think I say it's somewhere in the book like

1400
01:45:26.68 --> 01:45:34.28
Is there not another American in this freaking city, you know? I mean, where is everybody but what I didn't realize is the chaos going out at the target

1401
01:45:34.28 --> 01:45:36.28
With the ground con boy the other shoot downs

1402
01:45:36.60 --> 01:45:43.88
Because all you know is your your fox hole right you don't you don't know the big picture and once I once I saw the big picture I realized yeah

1403
01:45:45.16 --> 01:45:50.04
Certainly had we got in the assets we asked for what it made a difference but they weren't there so we couldn't do anything

1404
01:45:50.60 --> 01:45:52.60
So at this point

1405
01:45:52.60 --> 01:45:57.16
You're like a ragdoff and they're just this mobs got you

1406
01:45:58.76 --> 01:46:00.76
Did you have any indication

1407
01:46:01.24 --> 01:46:02.36
At

1408
01:46:02.36 --> 01:46:07.88
That you were gonna survive this or was it just just just who when when did they start to rip me apart right?

1409
01:46:07.88 --> 01:46:09.32
I mean it's like what's next?

1410
01:46:09.32 --> 01:46:11.96
You know we've already been through two or three cycles here where

1411
01:46:12.76 --> 01:46:20.60
The end seemed imminent and and here we go again and then then it settles down when they throw me in this first location

1412
01:46:20.60 --> 01:46:25.80
Where we stop but you know the threat of death was always there. I mean they're just all amped up

1413
01:46:25.80 --> 01:46:31.64
Just you you've been there when when you're in the when you're in the fight you're adrenaline is so high and you're

1414
01:46:32.28 --> 01:46:36.60
You know from their perspective on the bad guy, you know, I'm the guy that's causing all this problem

1415
01:46:37.32 --> 01:46:43.96
Yeah, you're the bad guy that caused all the problems right every the you're the one guy that they've got to take it all out on exactly

1416
01:46:43.96 --> 01:46:50.44
Um, so they eventually get you they take you and

1417
01:46:50.92 --> 01:46:56.04
Put you in a closed space and some kind you can't really see what's going on because you know you've got the the

1418
01:46:57.48 --> 01:47:05.08
Whatever your eyes were blindfolded the the continual choruses Ranger Ranger you die Somalia right

1419
01:47:05.64 --> 01:47:07.64
Freaking nightmare

1420
01:47:07.64 --> 01:47:14.36
um now once you get once you sort of you're you're into this closed space

1421
01:47:14.92 --> 01:47:20.76
You kind of you know you say this in the book here those first few minutes of capture critical don't piss off your captors

1422
01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:23.64
So you went into like the sear mode

1423
01:47:24.92 --> 01:47:28.04
Instinctively right there at the crash site and you know it wasn't like

1424
01:47:29.24 --> 01:47:33.32
You know, I made this conscious decision, you know the game is different now. It's just sort of

1425
01:47:33.32 --> 01:47:37.88
It just happened natural you know it didn't became obvious the fight was over you know, I mean I got

1426
01:47:38.36 --> 01:47:43.24
There's nothing I can do and now I'm in their hands so I got a river to what they taught me

1427
01:47:43.96 --> 01:47:48.04
To survive a situation like this and most of it actually worked pretty well and surprising

1428
01:47:49.24 --> 01:47:50.60
And I shouldn't say surprise

1429
01:47:50.60 --> 01:47:56.04
How do you know you know it is surprised it's a little bit surprising because you hope it works

1430
01:47:56.04 --> 01:47:58.68
But you know when you're in sear school it works

1431
01:47:58.68 --> 01:48:02.92
Yeah, but we're here to do all the freaking crazed mob of Somalis

1432
01:48:03.72 --> 01:48:10.20
I mean I'm surprised you know I'm surprised I even reading it you know I just

1433
01:48:11.32 --> 01:48:15.80
I guess I keep referring back to the fact like you just knew you were gonna die because if I was in that situation

1434
01:48:15.80 --> 01:48:20.20
I'd be like I'm 100% there's no amgain out of this yeah not against a

1435
01:48:21.32 --> 01:48:24.36
1000 crazed mob

1436
01:48:24.36 --> 01:48:28.20
Like it's not you're not gonna get out of that. It's a freaking miracle

1437
01:48:29.40 --> 01:48:32.20
So you get into this room they they're

1438
01:48:32.76 --> 01:48:38.60
They're arguing about you they're yelling at each other like you can see there's some kind of

1439
01:48:40.44 --> 01:48:44.92
It seems to start to take some kind of shape right it starts to take some kind of shape like

1440
01:48:45.48 --> 01:48:47.48
They have another purpose for you

1441
01:48:48.20 --> 01:48:49.88
They end up

1442
01:48:49.88 --> 01:48:54.92
I mean I guess once you get away from the mob you must have felt a little bit better things did settle down

1443
01:48:55.56 --> 01:49:01.24
And one thing I didn't know is that I was actually taken by a rival clan and Mark Bowden is the one who did

1444
01:49:01.80 --> 01:49:03.80
Discovers this when he writes black-hawked out

1445
01:49:04.04 --> 01:49:05.48
Of course this is according to Somalis

1446
01:49:05.48 --> 01:49:09.32
I don't know if it's true or not but it makes sense if you think about the dynamics of those few

1447
01:49:09.96 --> 01:49:11.16
few hours

1448
01:49:11.16 --> 01:49:18.20
Because I did get moved a couple times and the characters did change so it's it's very likely I was in fact

1449
01:49:18.20 --> 01:49:25.08
You know basically stole and by a rival plan and then the go-shaded to get back to the hobby of getter clan

1450
01:49:26.28 --> 01:49:28.28
If it's not bizarre enough

1451
01:49:29.96 --> 01:49:31.96
You get chained up

1452
01:49:31.96 --> 01:49:37.96
But they change you in a such a way that you could you could let get your arm out so they weren't great at I guess

1453
01:49:38.28 --> 01:49:41.000
Chaining people I don't think they were great at very much actually

1454
01:49:41.88 --> 01:49:44.28
Fortunately no, yeah, I was able to squeeze out of it

1455
01:49:44.28 --> 01:49:46.28
Um

1456
01:49:46.28 --> 01:49:52.68
Another guy comes in eventually again. I'll look by the book. I'm fast-forwarding through a bunch of detail that's

1457
01:49:53.56 --> 01:49:58.84
That's fascinating the read and it gives a lot of the granular detail of what's going on eventually

1458
01:49:58.84 --> 01:50:03.40
You get a guy that comes in that's little less aggressive not as angry and offers you some water

1459
01:50:03.40 --> 01:50:11.72
Um, so you start to see a little bit of you know maybe there's a little bit of light a little bit of light at the end of the tunnel

1460
01:50:15.72 --> 01:50:22.36
This happened suddenly my captors outside were engaged in a battle. I could hear rounds being fired from the other side of the wall and yelling and chaos to

1461
01:50:22.36 --> 01:50:27.40
Groot to a fevered pitch bright flashes from their spinning gun barrels pierced through the ventilation holes above

1462
01:50:27.40 --> 01:50:33.48
My head and lit up myself like a lightning storm. I could feel the mighty the might of the US army approaching my door

1463
01:50:33.48 --> 01:50:36.76
It would all be over in a few minutes and for the very first time that day

1464
01:50:36.76 --> 01:50:40.12
I prayed I prayed to God to spare me and spare the lives of my comrades

1465
01:50:40.12 --> 01:50:43.96
I prayed for just a bit more of the mercy that it kept me alive until this moment

1466
01:50:44.76 --> 01:50:47.24
I'd been a casual cat Catholic before

1467
01:50:47.80 --> 01:50:53.72
But I would become a faithful servant forever if I could just have three more minutes of protection until I was on board a night stalker

1468
01:50:53.72 --> 01:50:55.72
Heelow and we were all flying off to freedom

1469
01:50:59.56 --> 01:51:01.56
Unfortunately, that was just another

1470
01:51:02.84 --> 01:51:08.28
Another firefight call on our guard. I think it was the ground convoy actually passing by close to me

1471
01:51:08.28 --> 01:51:14.44
That's the only thing I can come because I could hear what I think were 40 millimeter rounds actually flying through the air and then

1472
01:51:14.44 --> 01:51:21.80
You know pretty sizable explosions when those things hit and and it you know is marching toward me and then it gets a fever pitch and then

1473
01:51:21.80 --> 01:51:28.72
It starts to fade and and that's all that's the only thing I can come up with is that I was actually fairly close to where the ground

1474
01:51:28.72 --> 01:51:36.04
Convoy or a ground convoy I think you know because there was a couple of different efforts involved there and in getting to the target side on the ground

1475
01:51:36.76 --> 01:51:42.84
And just kind of demoralizing when it just starts to fade away in the distance and you've been shot where you got shot in the arm

1476
01:51:42.84 --> 01:51:45.56
I did yep, it was super super

1477
01:51:45.56 --> 01:51:52.76
Professional like all the shooting is gone on. I mean even when they were shooting up your bird that was on the ground like it's a miracle

1478
01:51:52.76 --> 01:51:54.76
You can get shot just by stray rounds

1479
01:51:55.80 --> 01:52:00.84
And that was a deflection actually it didn't hit me directly. We went off the floor and ended up in my left arm

1480
01:52:02.60 --> 01:52:08.20
Finally you meet this guy this guy comes in his name and he says my name is Mohammed gate

1481
01:52:09.40 --> 01:52:12.36
He offers you a smoke now what's the deal with Mohammed gate?

1482
01:52:12.36 --> 01:52:19.16
So he was probably the most sophisticated character that I dealt with he was basically trying to

1483
01:52:20.44 --> 01:52:27.08
convince me that you know the samallies were the victims and all this and then general indeed was a righteous man and

1484
01:52:27.64 --> 01:52:31.000
I think I put in there that he was telling me bedtime stories, you know

1485
01:52:31.40 --> 01:52:36.28
He was because if you go back in history you could see how that version of the story

1486
01:52:36.84 --> 01:52:39.24
From some perspectives could be believable. I mean

1487
01:52:39.24 --> 01:52:44.92
Where things go south on a deed is when he starts stealing all the food that's there from the relief organization

1488
01:52:44.92 --> 01:52:51.000
You know that's where he kind of loses my vote but before then you know leading the the overthrow of

1489
01:52:51.24 --> 01:52:53.32
What was described as a pretty

1490
01:52:53.88 --> 01:52:57.16
difficult prior government he's a hero and

1491
01:52:57.80 --> 01:53:02.76
This is what Mohammed gate is telling you about he's telling you what the history of samallia and now he's a great man

1492
01:53:02.76 --> 01:53:07.56
He led his people to freedom and we really got this all wrong. You know we're chasing the wrong guy right so

1493
01:53:07.56 --> 01:53:16.76
And again having gone to survival school and understanding that this is something you might encounter and probably will certainly in a long-term situation

1494
01:53:18.20 --> 01:53:25.000
I had my guard up you know, but the reality is and and I have no expert on captivity. There's people that spent

1495
01:53:26.04 --> 01:53:28.04
Longer and captivity and I did

1496
01:53:28.68 --> 01:53:32.20
But over time if you repeat a story often enough

1497
01:53:32.20 --> 01:53:39.56
It starts to creep into your your mind and and I think it gains credibility over time through repetition

1498
01:53:39.56 --> 01:53:41.56
So it's a long practice

1499
01:53:42.12 --> 01:53:45.32
Technique and I wasn't there long enough for them to work

1500
01:53:45.56 --> 01:53:50.28
But I'm sure they would have tried to do that because for them getting an American to say

1501
01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:55.08
Hey, this guy is really you know, we shouldn't be chasing him. This is this is all wrong

1502
01:53:55.64 --> 01:53:59.000
That's like gold. Yeah, that's worth a fleet of

1503
01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:02.60
Jet fighters to them, you know, so that's what they're after

1504
01:54:05.56 --> 01:54:10.36
Fast forward a little bit you end up you know you you you it gets dark you go to sleep you wake up

1505
01:54:11.48 --> 01:54:14.76
And and you start going into your your first kind of day

1506
01:54:16.28 --> 01:54:18.28
of captivity here

1507
01:54:19.48 --> 01:54:21.72
He says how are you Ranger?

1508
01:54:23.08 --> 01:54:27.88
I was not a Ranger, but I didn't bother correcting my form the recognizable symbol for okay with my fingers

1509
01:54:27.88 --> 01:54:33.96
Your friends he began and then pause like a surge in emerging from the operating room with bad news

1510
01:54:33.96 --> 01:54:35.96
You are the only one

1511
01:54:36.36 --> 01:54:39.16
I waited for the rest of it. I hope that he meant I was the only one captured

1512
01:54:40.20 --> 01:54:43.000
Gate came up with a packet cigarettes and I've offered me one

1513
01:54:43.96 --> 01:54:48.52
I heard the voice of one of my instructors from CIRSchool survival evasion resistors escape

1514
01:54:48.92 --> 01:54:53.40
You don't have to be subservient to your captors, but you do not but you do have to be cordial

1515
01:54:53.40 --> 01:54:55.88
politeness is a tactic not a surrender

1516
01:54:55.88 --> 01:55:01.40
No, thank you. We're the first words of my day and and he goes on to say

1517
01:55:01.80 --> 01:55:08.52
I'm sorry, but it's only you your friends are not living we thought maybe one alive under your helicopter at run away by night

1518
01:55:08.92 --> 01:55:10.92
But that is not true

1519
01:55:14.60 --> 01:55:22.92
You know he continued many Somali's very angry with the UN and Americans many many Somali's die in this fighting our women there the most angry

1520
01:55:22.92 --> 01:55:24.92
They are also the most cruel

1521
01:55:26.12 --> 01:55:29.88
Somali woman must take a revenge upon a person who kills her son or husband

1522
01:55:30.04 --> 01:55:35.72
She must take something from the guilty person. There's no trial. No jury. This is justice in our world

1523
01:55:38.60 --> 01:55:40.60
So again this guy's educate you on

1524
01:55:43.16 --> 01:55:45.16
On what's happening

1525
01:55:45.72 --> 01:55:50.12
And and I will say that I did feel that that was the case when the mob was

1526
01:55:50.12 --> 01:55:55.32
Taking place at the women where the one screaming allowed us and kind of breaking through and

1527
01:55:56.04 --> 01:56:03.08
You know taking a shot here and there and you know that's why I'm gonna sue when it's correct you say again fast-forwarding

1528
01:56:05.24 --> 01:56:11.08
At this point a new character entered the drama he was proceeded by four body guards and as he swept into the room

1529
01:56:11.48 --> 01:56:18.44
The other Somali's gate included retreated a bit and nearly bowed with respect he was middle aged war pencil thin mustache

1530
01:56:18.44 --> 01:56:26.12
And the wide fringe of hair surrounding his bald head looked freshly cut his colorful short sleeve shirt

1531
01:56:26.44 --> 01:56:30.84
Spotted pastel palm fronds and his base trousers were crisp and clean

1532
01:56:31.08 --> 01:56:37.16
Here remind me of a Miami Beach tourist. He seemed well educated and his manned English was delivered in soft tones

1533
01:56:38.04 --> 01:56:43.08
My name is Mr. Abdi is that right Abdi? Abdi. Abdi. My name is Mr. Abdi and yours

1534
01:56:43.40 --> 01:56:47.96
It was clear that this man held some kind of higher position well above the tactical lever level

1535
01:56:47.96 --> 01:56:52.36
It's time for me to give up one of the big four name ranks or service number and data birth

1536
01:56:52.84 --> 01:56:55.80
Durant Michael J Durant is there anything you need Mr. Durant?

1537
01:56:55.80 --> 01:57:02.28
I need a doctor. Yes, I can see that Abdi said the Somali surrounding him to be let seem to be less and very carefully

1538
01:57:02.44 --> 01:57:05.88
Trying to understand his nearly whispered English and is there anything else?

1539
01:57:06.36 --> 01:57:08.92
I need to be set free of course

1540
01:57:08.92 --> 01:57:11.56
He nodded as if expecting me to say that very thing

1541
01:57:11.56 --> 01:57:19.80
We will provide you with medical attention and I will make sure you are treated as well as possible

1542
01:57:19.80 --> 01:57:25.08
Yeah, I don't know where he was in the food chain, but it's pretty high up and he

1543
01:57:25.48 --> 01:57:27.08
You know the Somali's at this point

1544
01:57:27.48 --> 01:57:31.000
I don't know maybe this might be a little early for them to reach this conclusion

1545
01:57:31.40 --> 01:57:37.24
But but this didn't play well for them the things that they did with with with the bodies of

1546
01:57:37.24 --> 01:57:46.76
The comrades from crash I too that made it into the media and just the perception that you know the US in the end

1547
01:57:47.16 --> 01:57:53.64
Was really there to try to help them. I mean, you know put everything else aside put you know the specific of that battle to the side

1548
01:57:54.12 --> 01:57:57.72
The mission was to help the freaking Somali people and in return

1549
01:57:58.44 --> 01:58:03.48
They're killing us and dragon are remains through the streets. I mean that doesn't play well anywhere

1550
01:58:03.48 --> 01:58:09.64
So I think he realizes this and indeed realizes this and they got to do some damage control

1551
01:58:10.36 --> 01:58:17.96
So they're not gonna be perhaps as as hostile toward me as they might have otherwise because they don't want to be perceived

1552
01:58:18.60 --> 01:58:20.60
for seen as seen as the

1553
01:58:21.40 --> 01:58:27.08
The savages. I'll use that right you know that that in some cases they acted like I mean there's no question about it

1554
01:58:29.80 --> 01:58:31.80
one of the

1555
01:58:31.80 --> 01:58:35.80
One of the guest most critical points most painful points for you

1556
01:58:36.68 --> 01:58:41.96
Was when they show up with a video camera and you kind of talk about in the book, you know

1557
01:58:42.76 --> 01:58:50.44
your your knowledge and recollection of those type of situations occurring in Vietnam in the go for and I rack

1558
01:58:51.24 --> 01:58:54.76
And you kind of know it's common that you're gonna get you're gonna get this

1559
01:58:55.64 --> 01:58:57.64
propaganda opportunity for them

1560
01:58:57.64 --> 01:59:05.80
I'm gonna go to the book here. There was a man with a video camera on a shoulder and two more with tripods batteries and flood bites

1561
01:59:06.20 --> 01:59:09.08
Why you come to Somalia? Why you kill innocent?

1562
01:59:09.88 --> 01:59:12.36
Will you answer these questions and?

1563
01:59:13.72 --> 01:59:16.92
interrogating you in this methodology they go on and on

1564
01:59:17.72 --> 01:59:19.72
Questions began again

1565
01:59:19.72 --> 01:59:23.56
In those next few moments I would utter responses that would change the rest of my life

1566
01:59:24.04 --> 01:59:26.04
Why you come to Somalia?

1567
01:59:26.04 --> 01:59:29.56
I'm a soldier. I said in flat expression was tone. I do as I'm told

1568
01:59:30.68 --> 01:59:34.36
And again, that's kind of like a standard-seer answer. Hey, I'm just doing what I'm told

1569
01:59:34.92 --> 01:59:42.36
Why you kill innocent people? I glance at my interrogator then back at the camera so that at least someone out there could see I was responding

1570
01:59:42.36 --> 01:59:44.36
Against my will

1571
01:59:44.60 --> 01:59:46.84
innocent people being killed is not good. I said

1572
01:59:48.84 --> 01:59:52.76
Someone snapped his fingers. They turned the camera off and shut down the lights. It was over

1573
01:59:52.76 --> 01:59:59.16
They had what they wanted within minutes the room had been cleared of everyone and I slumped down on my back

1574
01:59:59.96 --> 02:00:04.12
I laid their reviewing every second of it in my mind and decided that I'd done all right

1575
02:00:04.52 --> 02:00:10.36
The only thing that video accomplished was to tell the world that the Somalia's had an American in captivity

1576
02:00:10.84 --> 02:00:16.28
I didn't second guess my decision to answer and I believe then as I do now it was the right thing to do

1577
02:00:16.28 --> 02:00:25.96
And that I remember watching this stuff when I hit the air. It's kind of freaking crazy that I'm sitting here talking to you right now actually

1578
02:00:26.84 --> 02:00:31.88
You know this is a nineteen ninety-three like I said I was coming back. I was back from my first sealed deployment and and

1579
02:00:32.20 --> 02:00:35.000
Was thinking to myself you know God look at what's going on

1580
02:00:38.84 --> 02:00:45.48
Was that was that you know that they're trying to get you to say the best they could get out of you is innocent being killed

1581
02:00:45.48 --> 02:00:47.48
People being killed is not good

1582
02:00:47.48 --> 02:00:51.88
That's like the best propaganda they could get out of you so I don't think they knew what I said

1583
02:00:51.88 --> 02:00:56.44
I don't think they completely understood it. I think they just thought okay. We got it you know

1584
02:00:56.92 --> 02:01:04.36
Because if you analyze it, I mean it's it's worth it. Yeah, and again the the credit there goes to the to the training

1585
02:01:04.68 --> 02:01:07.16
You know without the training. I don't know what I do

1586
02:01:07.96 --> 02:01:13.32
Probably reverse or the big four but you know it was proven in Vietnam

1587
02:01:13.32 --> 02:01:19.48
That doesn't work and you gotta have some guidelines to go by beyond that and

1588
02:01:20.20 --> 02:01:25.24
You know I was fortunate that I had gone to the training and new new kind of how to handle it

1589
02:01:25.40 --> 02:01:31.08
Yeah, you have a great sentence. I won't read it, but as they started interrogating you you started using you know

1590
02:01:31.32 --> 02:01:38.12
In like big words, you know multi-salebic words that they just could not understand it's it's a freaking classic sentence

1591
02:01:38.12 --> 02:01:44.84
That's a kind of thing that you learn in you know in sear school. Hey talk to them and a language that's elevated above what they actually know

1592
02:01:45.48 --> 02:01:47.48
so

1593
02:01:48.36 --> 02:01:52.36
You end up with that again. It's kind of crazy that I was sitting there watching that as a young the seal

1594
02:01:53.56 --> 02:01:57.08
You know clenched in my fist saying how can we how can I help? How will what could I do?

1595
02:01:57.80 --> 02:02:01.80
It had that effect on a lot of people and I think part of it is it came out of nowhere

1596
02:02:01.80 --> 02:02:04.68
I mean nobody thought anything like that was gonna happen this morning

1597
02:02:04.68 --> 02:02:10.20
I mean this was a relief operation and all of a sudden we're going from handing out bags of food to this

1598
02:02:10.20 --> 02:02:13.48
You know, I mean it just it was it had a shock and a lot of fact. I think and

1599
02:02:14.76 --> 02:02:19.64
You know and and everyone's reaction was pretty much the same you know we need to go in there and just

1600
02:02:21.40 --> 02:02:27.96
Devastate this place because this is just you can't treat Americans this way and and motivated a lot of people

1601
02:02:27.96 --> 02:02:34.28
Um you end up in another you get transported again. They take you to another spot

1602
02:02:35.64 --> 02:02:40.36
You said I looked around on my new digs now flooded the early daylight because this is it now several days in

1603
02:02:40.84 --> 02:02:45.16
The door was closed to fix the cheap lock like the one in my previous cell one of the window shutters

1604
02:02:45.16 --> 02:02:47.16
And open I could see another building not three feet away

1605
02:02:47.80 --> 02:02:53.48
There were no birds chirping and I could hear more street traffic. I concluded we had moved to a more densely populated part of the city

1606
02:02:53.48 --> 02:02:59.88
Now you got another guy that does in the scene now for Rimbee. I'm saying that right for Rimbee. What's the deal with this guy?

1607
02:03:00.20 --> 02:03:02.20
So he's got a big goofy guy actually

1608
02:03:02.92 --> 02:03:11.40
He was he was a sign the responsibility to make sure that I stayed alive basically that was his and that another clan didn't get me

1609
02:03:11.96 --> 02:03:15.56
And he had a few handful of guards, you know, and they

1610
02:03:16.28 --> 02:03:19.16
But he was kind of a goofy guy and initially he was very

1611
02:03:19.16 --> 02:03:28.28
Aggressive I would say but over time he became much more personable to the point where I think he'd a really struggle to

1612
02:03:28.28 --> 02:03:34.04
Fizzorders were to kill me. I really do you know on it again it goes back to just

1613
02:03:34.60 --> 02:03:38.20
The stuff you learn as a kid, you know you treat others the way you want to be treated you

1614
02:03:38.44 --> 02:03:43.16
You don't act like a jerk, you know that they're Muslim and when it was prior time I was respectful

1615
02:03:43.16 --> 02:03:48.84
I didn't you know I let them do what they need to do and and the and that goes both ways, you know

1616
02:03:48.84 --> 02:03:52.84
So it just it wasn't really a strategy necessarily as it was just

1617
02:03:53.24 --> 02:03:58.44
Kind of common sense combined with some of the training that I got and you know why would you want to make this guy

1618
02:03:59.24 --> 02:04:03.08
Do anything other than want to help you right? I mean there was a couple times that

1619
02:04:03.56 --> 02:04:09.40
Things happened to me physically and and I needed some help getting cleaned up and and he did it

1620
02:04:09.40 --> 02:04:12.28
I'm like man, I'm not sure how to do this for you, but I appreciate

1621
02:04:13.32 --> 02:04:15.32
You said the earned is combat

1622
02:04:15.32 --> 02:04:21.16
Yes, yeah, that sounds like a rough duty even I didn't want that. Yeah, it's for sure. What about doctor?

1623
02:04:21.16 --> 02:04:23.16
How do you say his name doctor caday?

1624
02:04:23.80 --> 02:04:28.44
Cadaya cadaya cadaya cadaya cadaya and what was it what was going on with doctor cadaya?

1625
02:04:29.16 --> 02:04:33.56
He had actually gone to school in the US you went to Med School in California I believe a USC

1626
02:04:33.56 --> 02:04:37.96
I think if I remember correctly and so he spoke decent English

1627
02:04:39.48 --> 02:04:43.08
But he had nothing left, you know this was a big fight people don't often

1628
02:04:43.08 --> 02:04:46.44
Realize how big the fight was from the Somali's perspective

1629
02:04:46.84 --> 02:04:51.64
I've heard numbers as high as 2,000 wooden on their side and in seven or 800 killed

1630
02:04:52.20 --> 02:04:59.08
So you know he's he's got limited resources to begin with and he's now dealt with all that and he doesn't come to see me for a couple of days

1631
02:04:59.64 --> 02:05:03.96
And I you know I describe it as a tackle box he had a he had a box of

1632
02:05:04.44 --> 02:05:09.32
Beta-dine gauze and a couple of instruments and that was in some aspirin. That's all he had

1633
02:05:09.80 --> 02:05:11.16
But he tried

1634
02:05:11.16 --> 02:05:13.16
And he's blunted my leg and

1635
02:05:13.88 --> 02:05:16.20
Unfortunately the fracture was so high

1636
02:05:16.20 --> 02:05:19.48
I mean, it's way up high. It's probably like two thirds up the femur

1637
02:05:20.28 --> 02:05:26.28
All he really accomplished was stabilizing my knee and my ankle so the only pivot point was the fracture

1638
02:05:26.76 --> 02:05:28.76
So when they moved me

1639
02:05:29.16 --> 02:05:35.32
That my leg is like this big thing that's and it's pivoting around the fracture site and I finally said man

1640
02:05:35.32 --> 02:05:38.52
You got to get this off and I finally convinced them to get it off

1641
02:05:38.52 --> 02:05:44.60
But you know he cleaned me up and he you know he did what he what he could and you never know

1642
02:05:44.60 --> 02:05:50.04
I mean could have saved my leg because you know open compound femur fracture and a nasty crap all like that is

1643
02:05:51.08 --> 02:05:54.28
The chance of infection is really high and I never got infected so

1644
02:05:54.84 --> 02:05:56.84
kind of amazing

1645
02:05:57.08 --> 02:06:02.04
The bring you some memories they start bringing you some water at this point you must be thinking like okay

1646
02:06:02.84 --> 02:06:07.16
I have a decent chant they're trying to take care of me. They got the doctor trying to give me guidance

1647
02:06:07.16 --> 02:06:09.16
um

1648
02:06:11.16 --> 02:06:13.56
Here we get another character rolls in and again

1649
02:06:13.56 --> 02:06:17.88
Get the book because you get to get the better introduction. I'm just kind of hitting the wave tops and these things

1650
02:06:18.52 --> 02:06:21.56
General it needs minister of internal affairs

1651
02:06:22.76 --> 02:06:27.08
He tells you your face has already been televised around the world

1652
02:06:27.08 --> 02:06:31.24
He continued almost with pride everyone knows that you are a prisoner in Shalaw

1653
02:06:31.80 --> 02:06:33.80
You will see your family again

1654
02:06:33.80 --> 02:06:38.68
Perhaps you would like a radio yes, I not a graciously a radio would be fantastic

1655
02:06:38.68 --> 02:06:40.68
So that your first recognition

1656
02:06:40.68 --> 02:06:42.68
Did you start to get a feeling for the fact that

1657
02:06:43.80 --> 02:06:50.92
Everybody knows what's going on here? Yeah at that point and at that point it becomes how long is this gonna last because with those injuries

1658
02:06:51.64 --> 02:06:55.48
After the fact they the doctors told me they thought I probably had 30 days to live

1659
02:06:56.28 --> 02:06:58.28
You know without proper care and

1660
02:06:59.000 --> 02:07:02.28
So it's a time it's a battle against time at that point, but it's certainly

1661
02:07:02.28 --> 02:07:05.96
Thought the much better than the first you know 24 hours for sure

1662
02:07:07.48 --> 02:07:12.36
You got a section in here that I think is just good to read because it's good lessons learned for life

1663
02:07:12.76 --> 02:07:15.64
You say it was my fourth day as a prisoner of war in Somalia

1664
02:07:15.64 --> 02:07:19.16
I knew I couldn't deal with captivity in terms of years

1665
02:07:19.80 --> 02:07:22.76
But I had to mentally prepare myself for a long haul

1666
02:07:23.56 --> 02:07:25.40
So as I started crumbling

1667
02:07:25.40 --> 02:07:31.08
Stared at this crumbling sea ceiling of hotel nowhere and listened to the furious buzzing of the black flies

1668
02:07:31.08 --> 02:07:34.28
I told myself that I would survive just one day at a time

1669
02:07:34.60 --> 02:07:37.88
I would not imagine my captivity as years of tortured waiting

1670
02:07:38.28 --> 02:07:44.76
Because if I really believe that I would probably die my mind could not accept being in prison for that long and those kind of things

1671
02:07:44.92 --> 02:07:48.76
Those kind of thoughts would break me like any major challenge in life

1672
02:07:48.84 --> 02:07:53.56
You have to take it in bits and pieces you don't try and tackle the whole thing at once

1673
02:07:53.56 --> 02:08:02.44
I remembered how I reacted at the crash site when it was overrun and I had focused on surviving for just five minutes and then making it through the next five

1674
02:08:03.24 --> 02:08:07.96
And so as day four dawned and I ventured further into the black tunnel of captivity

1675
02:08:08.12 --> 02:08:12.92
I needed a limited point of reference or that darkness would just overwhelm me

1676
02:08:13.88 --> 02:08:17.72
You just need to make it to tomorrow. I told myself if you wake up tomorrow

1677
02:08:17.72 --> 02:08:20.44
You'll figure out how to survive another tomorrow

1678
02:08:20.44 --> 02:08:23.48
Today you've got to figure out how to survive today

1679
02:08:24.68 --> 02:08:26.84
So that's the that's the mode you're going into

1680
02:08:27.80 --> 02:08:29.80
Good lesson for

1681
02:08:29.80 --> 02:08:35.64
Freaking life in general. It's any challenge any big challenge. It's just one at a time. That's all you can do

1682
02:08:37.96 --> 02:08:38.92
Eventually

1683
02:08:38.92 --> 02:08:44.20
Obdi shows up in again and you're gonna get a visit from the red cross

1684
02:08:44.20 --> 02:08:48.20
Red cross

1685
02:08:51.48 --> 02:08:53.96
And you get this radio that's working

1686
02:08:57.48 --> 02:09:02.92
Once you're on the radio you start hearing the reports and that was that had to be

1687
02:09:03.48 --> 02:09:07.80
That had to be crazy. It is it is because I mean like they're playing music

1688
02:09:08.84 --> 02:09:11.88
There's your quests for me because they found out that I had the radio

1689
02:09:11.88 --> 02:09:17.56
So now now guys in test force range are requesting songs and and data then requested

1690
02:09:17.56 --> 02:09:19.56
Whoops there it is or something

1691
02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:27.000
You have

1692
02:09:27.24 --> 02:09:30.12
Yeah, they're they're given a report before you get to the radio request

1693
02:09:30.12 --> 02:09:33.24
They're given reports of what's going on. This is sort of your first indication

1694
02:09:33.80 --> 02:09:38.04
You know you hear this report on BBC on Sunday October third round 4 p.m

1695
02:09:38.04 --> 02:09:45.40
Quick US quick reaction forced to 10 24 suspected I did militant members and a certain sees her operation

1696
02:09:45.88 --> 02:09:48.52
We believe several key militant members were among them

1697
02:09:50.52 --> 02:09:56.44
Three of the 24 detainees data wounds reserve received during the operation one detainees being treated

1698
02:09:57.24 --> 02:10:01.08
Key militant members we have detained were not among those who died wounded

1699
02:10:01.08 --> 02:10:06.76
As the and then he goes into this as the operation was in progress

1700
02:10:07.32 --> 02:10:13.96
Two US Army black-hawkella copies were lost due to ground fire during this time the troops evacuating the detainees came

1701
02:10:13.96 --> 02:10:19.48
Under fine return fire about 70 ranges surrounded one down helicopter dust they formed perimeter

1702
02:10:21.88 --> 02:10:26.68
To protect the wounded members of the crew while awaiting a medical evacuation and they two came under fire

1703
02:10:26.68 --> 02:10:34.28
The task force was organized consisting of two US Army infantry companies 24 Malaysian armored personnel carriers

1704
02:10:34.52 --> 02:10:40.44
Four Pakistani tanks two Pakistani armored personnel carriers a range of platoon in a company of armored humvies

1705
02:10:40.60 --> 02:10:45.40
The task force reached the down aircraft at two 30 Monday morning and evacuated the soldiers

1706
02:10:47.48 --> 02:10:52.84
I realized that I'd been in a furious battle that had been the furious battle I'd witnessed on my first night of captivity

1707
02:10:53.88 --> 02:10:54.84
Yes

1708
02:10:54.84 --> 02:10:59.48
No matter what injuries cliff and dawn had sustained I was certain now they'd been rescued

1709
02:11:00.68 --> 02:11:08.68
And then the report continues regrettably there were number of US casualties in these engagements as the Pentagon has already released five US soldiers have died

1710
02:11:09.40 --> 02:11:11.40
In addition to number of been wounded

1711
02:11:12.44 --> 02:11:18.84
It wasn't good news the major tone was cautious and I knew that his announcement of casualty figures was preliminary

1712
02:11:18.84 --> 02:11:27.24
I had no doubt that the numbers of our dead wounded would increase so

1713
02:11:28.36 --> 02:11:36.20
You're hearing all these reports of of what it unfolded and you're like you said earlier you're an eternal optimist

1714
02:11:36.20 --> 02:11:40.20
And to you you hear these reports and you're painting them in the best possible light right

1715
02:11:43.64 --> 02:11:45.64
Yeah

1716
02:11:45.64 --> 02:11:49.72
What about the black off flying overhead with plain acdc?

1717
02:11:50.84 --> 02:11:52.84
What was that all about?

1718
02:11:52.84 --> 02:11:54.04
Well

1719
02:11:54.04 --> 02:11:56.04
It is somewhat sensitive there was

1720
02:11:57.56 --> 02:12:00.84
There was a method to the madness it wasn't just to make me feel better

1721
02:12:01.96 --> 02:12:05.08
And I guess we'll leave it at that and then then Dan

1722
02:12:05.56 --> 02:12:10.92
Dan Jalato's real good friend of mine just got inducted in the army of each to all the fame actually just recently

1723
02:12:10.92 --> 02:12:17.56
Was flying not flying but recorded his voice and he's calling to be from the sky Mike we won't leave you behind

1724
02:12:17.56 --> 02:12:24.20
I and I just got to chill up my spine. I mean I still do just thinking about that moment because you know

1725
02:12:24.76 --> 02:12:28.44
You're not gonna be left behind. I mean you know that you know the unit you're with

1726
02:12:28.44 --> 02:12:33.32
There's the unit that's gonna get called upon to rescue people and situations like me and you know what they can do

1727
02:12:33.96 --> 02:12:37.96
So it's just a matter of time but to hear your friend calling you from the sky just

1728
02:12:39.08 --> 02:12:40.84
Incredibly powerful

1729
02:12:40.84 --> 02:12:42.84
um

1730
02:12:42.84 --> 02:12:44.84
You end up getting that red cross visit

1731
02:12:46.12 --> 02:12:51.88
This is like a how do you describe incredible angel of mercy is what you see this woman as

1732
02:12:52.36 --> 02:12:54.36
Suzanne Hofstetter

1733
02:12:54.60 --> 02:12:57.88
From the red cross and she's there to kind of check on you

1734
02:12:58.12 --> 02:13:03.72
You your first look she can tell looking your face she's like all your faces all I'm getting out she's like you're not getting released today

1735
02:13:03.72 --> 02:13:07.32
She won't give you that news upfront but she was there to check on you

1736
02:13:07.32 --> 02:13:09.32
um

1737
02:13:10.20 --> 02:13:14.04
And she actually gives you a chance to write a letter to your family

1738
02:13:16.52 --> 02:13:22.68
You say this I decided to keep it personally and mostly informative so that at least my family would worry less

1739
02:13:24.04 --> 02:13:26.52
This is what I wrote dear Lori and Joey

1740
02:13:26.52 --> 02:13:33.000
I know you must be worried about how I am doing they are treating me well the Somali doctor comes every day and cleans my injuries

1741
02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:38.68
The people are taking care of me are also treating me well they get whatever kind of food

1742
02:13:38.68 --> 02:13:41.32
I asked for but there's no pizza available unfortunately

1743
02:13:41.88 --> 02:13:48.12
I want nothing more in the world than to be with you and Joey again. I see his face and I pray this will all turn out okay

1744
02:13:48.52 --> 02:13:53.24
Please tell everyone else in the family that I hear their prayers and things will work out okay

1745
02:13:53.72 --> 02:14:00.04
Nothing else matters more to me than to see my family again. I think I will I really do

1746
02:14:00.04 --> 02:14:07.80
You stay positive and be strong and give Joey more hugs and kisses for his dad that misses him so

1747
02:14:08.92 --> 02:14:13.56
I broke my leg compound fracture right femur and injured my back in the crash

1748
02:14:13.56 --> 02:14:15.88
I think my nose is broken but it does not hurt

1749
02:14:16.04 --> 02:14:21.08
I have a superficial gunshot wound in my left arm the leg and back are the only real problems

1750
02:14:21.08 --> 02:14:27.000
But as I said the medical care has been very good. I hope to see you soon and I pray for the others who are missing Ray

1751
02:14:27.000 --> 02:14:30.84
Bill Tommy and anyone else I love you

1752
02:14:32.12 --> 02:14:39.40
I signed with my full signature Michael Durant a particular scribble that would assure anyone reading the letter that I had in fact written it

1753
02:14:39.96 --> 02:14:45.64
When I was done I was in tears to think that this document would soon be in the hands of my family was just overwhelming

1754
02:14:50.92 --> 02:14:52.92
And what's interesting is that uh

1755
02:14:52.92 --> 02:14:59.64
You know people like everyone got to see this letter the whole world right and including the intel people that were looking for the

1756
02:15:00.04 --> 02:15:02.04
Looking for the coded

1757
02:15:02.04 --> 02:15:04.04
Information that you had in there

1758
02:15:04.52 --> 02:15:08.92
Trying to figure out what you meant by a pizza because your favorite food was actually spaghetti

1759
02:15:09.80 --> 02:15:12.76
And there was this spaghetti factory in Mogadishu

1760
02:15:13.16 --> 02:15:17.32
So yeah, they went down a lot of rabbit holes. They took down every dominoes in the city

1761
02:15:17.32 --> 02:15:19.32
Oh

1762
02:15:20.52 --> 02:15:22.52
Those are some motivated friends man

1763
02:15:23.96 --> 02:15:30.44
Um and then you add so Suzanne the rod Red Cross girl ends up going back to

1764
02:15:31.48 --> 02:15:33.48
Task force and debriefing them and

1765
02:15:34.12 --> 02:15:38.28
She she gives them information of one of the information as you mentioned early was that you had a radio

1766
02:15:38.52 --> 02:15:44.44
And so now now these guys everyone knows that you're actually listening to the radio and they start

1767
02:15:44.44 --> 02:15:48.52
Freaking set send in songs to you and whatnot. Yeah, just uh

1768
02:15:49.72 --> 02:15:52.44
Again, you can't make this stuff. Yeah, it's crazy to even think about

1769
02:15:53.88 --> 02:15:55.88
You know you get thunder struck

1770
02:15:57.48 --> 02:16:02.76
You end up with Willie Nelson and meet low from these guys are just said you know they're dedicated to you

1771
02:16:05.48 --> 02:16:11.40
They play rooster by Allison change which again. I was when I was on my first deployment overseas

1772
02:16:11.40 --> 02:16:17.48
You know that Allison change album was so big and that song was obviously so big

1773
02:16:17.48 --> 02:16:24.04
Anybody in the military and here you are freaking actually living out the rooster's story oh yourself

1774
02:16:24.52 --> 02:16:31.72
They sent me a signed copy of the CD and note after the fact by no way. Yeah. Oh, that's epic

1775
02:16:31.72 --> 02:16:35.72
Um

1776
02:16:37.56 --> 02:16:40.36
My seventh day as prisoner of war I found religion

1777
02:16:40.52 --> 02:16:46.92
It's all often been said that there are no atheist and foxholes meaning that even a non-believer will begin to pray when faced with his own mortality

1778
02:16:48.20 --> 02:16:53.72
But I never been given but I'd never been a Catholic of convenience who only prayed when times were tough

1779
02:16:53.72 --> 02:16:59.08
Admittedly as a boy at a tenatured to regularly with my family while it was an adult and full-time army helicopter pilot

1780
02:16:59.08 --> 02:17:04.76
I'd allow that tradition to lapse yet my absence from the fuse hadn't broken my bond with the Lord at times

1781
02:17:04.76 --> 02:17:10.36
I would's off for my Sunday prayers from the cockpit or say a silent grace over an mRE between missions or

1782
02:17:10.36 --> 02:17:13.08
Ask a chaplain for a quick blessing as I ran to my healo

1783
02:17:14.04 --> 02:17:17.64
It didn't require the threat of death for me to recall the sacraments

1784
02:17:18.20 --> 02:17:23.000
So when I say I found religion I meant it literally so in this red box

1785
02:17:23.000 --> 02:17:31.88
Cron you got enough getting a box from the red cross. They got a razor and they got tooth brush and toothpaste and a writing tablet and pens

1786
02:17:32.20 --> 02:17:34.20
They a fresh roll a toilet paper

1787
02:17:34.92 --> 02:17:40.92
Which for those people that haven't been in the field or experience life without toilet paper. This is a big deal

1788
02:17:43.88 --> 02:17:50.92
Some playing cards and then you say the very last item was a US army Bible about the size of a small paper back

1789
02:17:50.92 --> 02:17:58.12
It's cover and binding in desert camouflage colors it was then that I realized some of these items have come directly from task force Ranger

1790
02:17:59.40 --> 02:18:04.52
Of course then you do the same thing that they did which you start thinking there's got to be some kind of a weapon here some kind of a radio

1791
02:18:04.76 --> 02:18:09.000
What I'm gonna this is how I'm gonna get out where's the file so I can file through some bars

1792
02:18:11.48 --> 02:18:18.84
Then you start taking notes inside you start taking notes inside the you know the blank spaces inside the Bible you still have that I do

1793
02:18:18.84 --> 02:18:20.84
I should have brought it

1794
02:18:21.64 --> 02:18:23.64
That's a comeback

1795
02:18:24.76 --> 02:18:29.72
And again we talk about how much of this story is crazy this part

1796
02:18:30.76 --> 02:18:32.52
My wife spoke to me at dawn

1797
02:18:32.52 --> 02:18:40.20
I had woken up and turned on the radio hoping to hear some more encouraging news and maybe some rock and roll to start the day off right my pains for my leg and back

1798
02:18:40.20 --> 02:18:44.68
Which didn't seem to keep me awake at night gathered force the minute I opened my eyes

1799
02:18:44.68 --> 02:18:54.04
I lay there with my eyes closed the radio tight to my ear hardly taking in the voice of AFN's female DJ until she started talking about me

1800
02:18:55.16 --> 02:18:58.36
On Friday the Red Cross delivered a letter to Rans wife in the United States

1801
02:18:58.36 --> 02:19:04.20
She chose to answer him on camera on CNN and hopes that her husband would hear her reply my eyes snapped open

1802
02:19:04.20 --> 02:19:08.60
And I blinked hard thinking I might still be asleep and dreaming, but no it was low-res vores

1803
02:19:08.60 --> 02:19:14.84
Her lights southern accent clear as a bell and I listened and as I listened the emotions flowed through my veins and

1804
02:19:15.08 --> 02:19:16.60
Futtered in my chest

1805
02:19:16.60 --> 02:19:19.72
Then she said I'm making the statement and hopes that it will reach my husband

1806
02:19:19.72 --> 02:19:22.20
I want them to know that Joey and I are doing well

1807
02:19:22.20 --> 02:19:24.28
I received your letter from the Red Cross mic

1808
02:19:24.28 --> 02:19:28.28
I was very happy to hear that you are okay and that you are being treated well

1809
02:19:28.44 --> 02:19:32.84
Clay and the rest of your family are taking great care of us everyone is praying for you

1810
02:19:32.84 --> 02:19:36.20
I know you can hear my prayers and the prayers of your brothers

1811
02:19:36.20 --> 02:19:41.96
I should take a breath my own breathing was quick and shallow my years burning as I listened with every poor

1812
02:19:42.12 --> 02:19:46.04
Everything with a new house is moving along fine. We'll be living in our dream home soon

1813
02:19:46.60 --> 02:19:50.84
I hope they're taking care of you and feeding you right. I'll have a big pizza waiting for you soon

1814
02:19:51.32 --> 02:19:54.04
Joey is waiting for you to get back before he starts walking

1815
02:19:54.04 --> 02:19:58.04
You want this father to see his first steps take care of yourself. Don't worry about us

1816
02:19:58.28 --> 02:20:04.28
We'll be fine and remember babe as you've always told me NSDQ night stalkers don't quit

1817
02:20:04.28 --> 02:20:08.28
Take care of yourself. I love you very much with all my heart

1818
02:20:10.20 --> 02:20:15.88
The DJ cut back when Lori was done but compared to my wife's voice her drone sounded cold and lifeless

1819
02:20:21.80 --> 02:20:23.80
Yeah, that's

1820
02:20:26.36 --> 02:20:28.36
Untie gone precedent

1821
02:20:28.36 --> 02:20:33.96
Yeah, and all in 11 days you know, that's the roller coaster of it

1822
02:20:33.96 --> 02:20:38.20
That was really why I decided right that book because blackrock down doesn't get into any of this

1823
02:20:38.20 --> 02:20:45.96
You know the blackrock down story ends basically when the battle ends and and this book really picks up at that point and keeps going so

1824
02:20:47.08 --> 02:20:51.16
That was that was sort of the catalyst because it's just bizarre and as you've implied

1825
02:20:51.16 --> 02:20:55.56
I mean there are a lot of great lessons in there and you know some I learned after the fact some I

1826
02:20:55.56 --> 02:20:58.20
So my applied but there's there's a ton in there

1827
02:21:00.04 --> 02:21:09.24
You start getting word that the former American ambassador to Somalia Robert Oakley had showed up to sort of start moving this thing forward

1828
02:21:12.84 --> 02:21:18.52
Oakley this is this is good to read Oakley made his position very clear there would be no deals

1829
02:21:18.92 --> 02:21:25.16
There would be no exchange of prisoners either a deed would release me immediately and unconditionally or rescue a

1830
02:21:25.16 --> 02:21:29.08
Temp would be made he frame the rest of his message as speculation rather than a threat

1831
02:21:29.08 --> 02:21:35.88
I imagine that such a raid will come soon or rather than later he said and with massive US forces gathering here each day

1832
02:21:36.20 --> 02:21:39.64
Fighter aircraft and tanks and so forth it will certainly be a tragedy

1833
02:21:40.20 --> 02:21:45.32
A large portion of your city will no doubt be destroyed and perhaps mr. Durant along with it

1834
02:21:45.64 --> 02:21:49.96
But the US is not going to sit idly by and let the clock tick any longer

1835
02:21:49.96 --> 02:21:56.76
We need about a thousand Robert Oakley's the guy was I mean he's legit

1836
02:21:57.32 --> 02:22:01.000
I met him I could tell you the way they reacted as soon as he came back on the scene

1837
02:22:01.88 --> 02:22:06.04
He just changed the whole dynamic they trusted him and he was they called him a shoot straighter

1838
02:22:09.96 --> 02:22:13.24
And that's you know this is the type of threat that

1839
02:22:13.88 --> 02:22:17.64
They understood right they believed they believed that he would back it up and

1840
02:22:18.60 --> 02:22:19.88
They worked

1841
02:22:19.88 --> 02:22:22.60
Fast forward a little bit

1842
02:22:23.64 --> 02:22:28.36
Mr. Minister Abdi I'm saying that wrong or no, I'm odd. I'm odd. I'm sorry

1843
02:22:30.04 --> 02:22:35.08
He comes in I have some good news for you mr. Durant he said I'm all ears mr. Minister

1844
02:22:35.08 --> 02:22:39.80
I said he smiled slightly at that but actually I was all nerve endings

1845
02:22:39.80 --> 02:22:41.64
I could feel them twitching under my skin

1846
02:22:41.64 --> 02:22:46.44
He elders the Somali national alliance have convened he folded his hands behind his back

1847
02:22:46.44 --> 02:22:52.60
They have made a decision. I did not say anything. I just watched him waiting you will go home tomorrow Mr. Durant

1848
02:22:53.72 --> 02:22:55.72
unconditionally

1849
02:23:01.32 --> 02:23:02.36
Next day

1850
02:23:02.36 --> 02:23:04.36
October 14th today is the day

1851
02:23:05.48 --> 02:23:08.68
That was the entry I wrote my Bible that morning so

1852
02:23:09.96 --> 02:23:12.36
That's it you find out that you're going home

1853
02:23:12.36 --> 02:23:14.36
It's

1854
02:23:16.20 --> 02:23:20.84
It's a little bit anti climactic because it's almost surprised

1855
02:23:21.96 --> 02:23:24.60
It surprised the guards when they when they found you

1856
02:23:25.64 --> 02:23:28.36
Yeah at the US cop. Yeah the US cop no one knew I was going

1857
02:23:29.24 --> 02:23:32.20
They just sort of showed up is like a Fed X delivery or something

1858
02:23:33.72 --> 02:23:37.72
Yeah, by the way, I fell out of the back of the truck when they first took off

1859
02:23:37.72 --> 02:23:44.20
Yeah, it's a little bit of the keystone cops here. Okay. But yeah, you know you talk about that

1860
02:23:44.20 --> 02:23:49.16
They vote you to van as they the you were too big to fit in the van and close the doors

1861
02:23:49.48 --> 02:23:54.52
So they just leave the doors open and then they start pulling away and you start flying up the back and they grab hold of you as you're falling

1862
02:23:55.08 --> 02:23:57.08
I mean, yeah, like you said it's keystone cops

1863
02:23:58.28 --> 02:24:06.20
Eventually you show up there at a task force ranger or at the compound and this this jack

1864
02:24:06.20 --> 02:24:13.32
This jag is looking at you and he looked stood there looked at me for a moment and shocked and then yelled holy mother of God

1865
02:24:13.32 --> 02:24:15.32
It's Mike Doront medic

1866
02:24:15.32 --> 02:24:20.12
Then all hell broke loose. There's an army field hospital right there at the UN compound

1867
02:24:20.60 --> 02:24:26.20
Medics and nurses and doctors charge across the tarmac as you and soldiers pulled me out of the van a gurney appeared and they set me on the litter

1868
02:24:26.92 --> 02:24:28.12
As faces

1869
02:24:28.12 --> 02:24:33.56
Crowd it around me everyone shouting a barking orders at once people were yelling for instruments and medical equipment

1870
02:24:33.56 --> 02:24:38.28
And it was like a scene out of ER as they rushed me toward the large green tents of the hospital

1871
02:24:38.28 --> 02:24:40.76
I looked around but for him be was no one in sight

1872
02:24:41.24 --> 02:24:48.92
He'd faded away into the crowd and I left his world much in the way I'd come into it carried a loft and engulfed the by a mob

1873
02:24:52.20 --> 02:24:54.20
Then the doctors the nurses

1874
02:24:56.60 --> 02:24:58.60
They go to work

1875
02:24:58.60 --> 02:25:07.000
You know you talked earlier about finding out this is when you find out about found out about cliff and dawn event

1876
02:25:08.68 --> 02:25:10.68
Obviously just freaking

1877
02:25:12.68 --> 02:25:16.36
Horrible then and you're finding out about everyone else. I mean

1878
02:25:16.36 --> 02:25:20.36
um

1879
02:25:24.36 --> 02:25:30.28
Just to kind of close out the book here and again. We've skimmed the wave tops of this and it's so many good

1880
02:25:30.92 --> 02:25:35.72
Incredible pointy points in it you say this just to just to kind of finish it out

1881
02:25:36.28 --> 02:25:38.68
There was a C141 waiting to take me to Germany

1882
02:25:38.68 --> 02:25:46.28
But between the landing pad and the jet all 400 men of task force rangered come out to form two long rows

1883
02:25:46.68 --> 02:25:52.12
A corridor of sunburn faces and desert uniforms someone handed me a borrowed maroon beret

1884
02:25:53.000 --> 02:25:56.52
And Dan Jolada and Stan Wood Mark Bergamo

1885
02:25:56.52 --> 02:26:03.48
I'm saying that Bergamo Bergamo and tray Williams lifted my litter and we walked toward the ramp of the waiting transport

1886
02:26:03.48 --> 02:26:08.52
Every man in the task force was holding some kind of a cup every cup had a shot of whiskey in it

1887
02:26:09.08 --> 02:26:16.76
The men spoke to me and murmurs as I passed they wish me well and offered me thumbs up when we reached the cargo ramp of the jet

1888
02:26:17.24 --> 02:26:23.08
My friends held me there so I could look out over this honor guard of my brothers this company of heroes

1889
02:26:23.96 --> 02:26:28.04
General Garrison stepped up onto the ramp he handed me a shot glass of whiskey

1890
02:26:28.04 --> 02:26:34.20
While he raised his own and all the men raised theirs to the ice blue African sky

1891
02:26:35.40 --> 02:26:38.20
To our fallen comrades his voice echoed

1892
02:26:39.40 --> 02:26:41.40
We shall never forget them

1893
02:26:41.88 --> 02:26:44.84
To our fallen comrades 400 said in unison

1894
02:26:45.96 --> 02:26:47.96
We downed our shots

1895
02:26:47.96 --> 02:26:57.72
As from a speaker somewhere came a recording of God bless America when the men joined into singing it their voices were like thunder and I could feel the earth tremble

1896
02:26:58.36 --> 02:27:04.68
They carried me on to the plane at last I was really going home soon. I would inhale the sweet sense of America

1897
02:27:04.84 --> 02:27:07.88
Soon I would be holding my son yet so much had happened

1898
02:27:08.52 --> 02:27:12.84
So many of the best pieces of my life had been torn away that I felt empty and hollow

1899
02:27:12.84 --> 02:27:20.60
As the cargo ramp closed I looked at my hands the only things I had left without coveted night stalker beret

1900
02:27:21.72 --> 02:27:23.72
And the Bible and

1901
02:27:24.76 --> 02:27:27.24
Something I'd always taken for granted before

1902
02:27:29.08 --> 02:27:31.08
My freedom

1903
02:27:31.08 --> 02:27:35.08
So

1904
02:27:39.08 --> 02:27:42.28
You you going to some of this in the book as well

1905
02:27:43.08 --> 02:27:45.08
What happens after that?

1906
02:27:45.80 --> 02:27:49.64
You know there's there's that's a whole another there's a whole another dynamic that takes place

1907
02:27:49.64 --> 02:27:57.48
You know you're getting back to America you got to get surgeries you're getting I mean you had to be one of the most popular human beings in the world at that point

1908
02:27:57.48 --> 02:28:01.64
Certainly amongst military personnel and government people and you know they

1909
02:28:02.28 --> 02:28:05.72
Some of them want to get their picture taken with you so they can post

1910
02:28:05.72 --> 02:28:11.000
Or whatever right about it or have it in the newspaper or whatever you do back in the 90s

1911
02:28:11.000 --> 02:28:13.72
I guess you don't post it stone tablets

1912
02:28:14.52 --> 02:28:16.52
Yeah

1913
02:28:17.16 --> 02:28:22.28
You enter into you know starting to get surgeries. I mean your femur must have been all jacked up at this point

1914
02:28:22.28 --> 02:28:28.60
Yeah, so it it actually the muscle shrink so it had a seven centimeter overlap from the shrinkage

1915
02:28:28.60 --> 02:28:30.20
So they had to put me in traction

1916
02:28:30.20 --> 02:28:33.16
Which they did in Germany and I actually flew from Germany to the US

1917
02:28:33.80 --> 02:28:38.12
Interaction and they didn't set the femur till I got back to four-cample so it had been

1918
02:28:38.60 --> 02:28:41.88
When it was all said and done close to a month before they actually set it

1919
02:28:42.60 --> 02:28:43.56
And

1920
02:28:43.56 --> 02:28:48.84
It's interesting that your bones get really sticky if they've been broken like that for a while so

1921
02:28:48.84 --> 02:28:54.12
They it actually doesn't create a significant problem. I mean you can wait that long to set it

1922
02:28:54.12 --> 02:28:55.56
I was that was shocked

1923
02:28:55.56 --> 02:29:00.12
But you know terms of recovery on that it's like nothing ever happened to them. I mean it's

1924
02:29:01.08 --> 02:29:04.36
You know any they kind of messed up sometimes it don't get the angle right or you know

1925
02:29:04.36 --> 02:29:09.72
It's rotated slightly but I guess my doctor had a pro tractor or something

1926
02:29:11.72 --> 02:29:17.80
Lineed it up and then you're goal at that point came became to get back in the seat get back and become

1927
02:29:17.80 --> 02:29:23.72
Become a fully qualified pilot again for for the night stockers. How long did that take?

1928
02:29:24.04 --> 02:29:32.36
It took a little over a year because you know the femurod stayed in for a full year and then they had to take it out

1929
02:29:32.76 --> 02:29:35.40
And then I had to prove after that that I should be able to get back in the car

1930
02:29:35.40 --> 02:29:37.40
But in the nice thing was

1931
02:29:37.40 --> 02:29:42.60
Things had started to change about that time frame where where the military recognized the investment

1932
02:29:42.60 --> 02:29:45.000
They have in soldiers sailors and Marines and

1933
02:29:45.000 --> 02:29:51.72
And unlike previous generations where I would have been just a you know thanks for your service and and set home

1934
02:29:51.96 --> 02:29:56.28
You know that's why you have it was the beginning of this thought process where

1935
02:29:57.24 --> 02:30:02.28
Limmer no limb you want to stay in will find a way to make it happen and and I was sort of

1936
02:30:02.92 --> 02:30:11.72
It was happening right in real time as so I got a lot of help and support in trying to stay in and get back on flight status and and you

1937
02:30:11.72 --> 02:30:15.32
Uh, Ren the Marine Corps marathon had you run it before?

1938
02:30:15.32 --> 02:30:21.96
I did I run it all thing for you. I've only done two I did one before one after one after and I ran faster after

1939
02:30:23.24 --> 02:30:27.96
So that was that's because they're gonna take it away my flight pay so I had to I had to get moving

1940
02:30:28.60 --> 02:30:32.68
But that was the you know my part of the battle is is

1941
02:30:33.08 --> 02:30:37.56
Convincing the army he looked I just ran 26 miles faster and I could before this all happened

1942
02:30:37.56 --> 02:30:45.08
Yeah, I should be a lot of fly and I got a waiver and I got back in the park and and did you like take a

1943
02:30:45.72 --> 02:30:49.08
What was your rank or what were you doing what did you take like a cartoon and go?

1944
02:30:50.28 --> 02:30:53.64
There what I was like six of us that went yeah, we

1945
02:30:54.92 --> 02:30:56.28
We all

1946
02:30:56.28 --> 02:30:58.28
kind of did it in honor of

1947
02:30:58.28 --> 02:31:03.88
You know the guys that couldn't be there with us because Cliff Cliff wall cut had run at the first time

1948
02:31:03.88 --> 02:31:09.96
I don't think Donovan ran it but anyway, we had all you know we weren't like elite runners or anything but we did

1949
02:31:09.96 --> 02:31:12.76
Recess together, so we kind of did it for them

1950
02:31:15.64 --> 02:31:21.16
So you end up just going back into full flight status at the 160th well, there was kind of a

1951
02:31:22.04 --> 02:31:27.96
Pan-shaked on that I really didn't need to be operational again when you know I'd back they never did anything to it

1952
02:31:27.96 --> 02:31:35.24
It's still deformed right so you know I can't I can't spend three hours in seat God it but the leadership

1953
02:31:35.40 --> 02:31:42.52
Recognized that it you know it's sort of a moral victory for all of us if I got back on flight status and and so I I basically became a staff officer

1954
02:31:42.52 --> 02:31:46.28
I still flew but not operational got it yeah

1955
02:31:47.32 --> 02:31:48.68
when

1956
02:31:48.60 --> 02:31:51.32
We when we fast forward a little bit

1957
02:31:51.32 --> 02:31:58.92
1999 the book Black Hawk down comes out like how does that impact your your life your world or was that

1958
02:31:59.72 --> 02:32:02.28
Was the was the biggest let's say

1959
02:32:03.000 --> 02:32:08.60
Flip on the publicity radar when you got home for me the biggest blip was when I got home

1960
02:32:09.56 --> 02:32:15.56
When we found out that Black Hawk down was being because it first came out as a series of articles in the Philadelphia and quiet

1961
02:32:15.56 --> 02:32:17.56
That's that was the original

1962
02:32:17.56 --> 02:32:23.96
Documentation that led to the book and you know the paper was okay because everybody is out

1963
02:32:23.96 --> 02:32:27.32
Okay, it's just the newspaper is gonna limit a distribution. It's not gonna get that much attention

1964
02:32:27.56 --> 02:32:32.12
But when it started to turn into a book scared to crap out of all of us actually because you know

1965
02:32:32.12 --> 02:32:36.36
You don't know what they're gonna do with it. They could just turn into a ridiculously stupid story or

1966
02:32:36.76 --> 02:32:43.48
Something highly critical or inaccurate or whatever but in the end it turns out okay so you know we were all

1967
02:32:43.48 --> 02:32:47.000
Now the grat I know something the ground guys don't like it a lot

1968
02:32:47.88 --> 02:32:51.40
You know I wasn't there on the ground. I can't speak to it. I don't know but

1969
02:32:52.04 --> 02:32:56.12
But from an era perspective it's accurate enough. Yeah, it's so

1970
02:32:56.92 --> 02:32:58.92
It's very difficult

1971
02:32:58.92 --> 02:33:02.76
You know I got a friend of mine that was in sag and Vietnam

1972
02:33:03.32 --> 02:33:09.96
His name is John Strecher Meyer and he has his own podcast that he does now called the sag cast and he just

1973
02:33:09.96 --> 02:33:13.64
Just has guys from sag on from Vietnam and

1974
02:33:14.76 --> 02:33:19.32
Those guys like two of those guys that were on the same mission will tell different different

1975
02:33:20.04 --> 02:33:24.24
Different circumstances of how they saw go down and they're not neither one of them's wrong

1976
02:33:24.24 --> 02:33:28.52
Right just saw it from a different perspective and or remembered a different way

1977
02:33:28.76 --> 02:33:33.54
So I can't even imagine trying to piece together the

1978
02:33:34.20 --> 02:33:38.88
Perspective of however many guys were on the ground in the battle that day and have it

1979
02:33:38.88 --> 02:33:45.44
Have every person be satisfied with what was said that's a very tall task and and you know what?

1980
02:33:45.44 --> 02:33:47.44
I'm not saying that's wrong. I'm saying

1981
02:33:47.92 --> 02:33:53.72
You know a reporter could be on the ground with you and me entering a building and

1982
02:33:54.40 --> 02:33:59.28
Could report what exactly what he saw and you might think it was the worst story ever

1983
02:33:59.28 --> 02:34:04.44
And I might think it's great and we would both be right because you know he could miss

1984
02:34:04.44 --> 02:34:11.36
So that's a very big challenge, but yeah, I mean obviously all of us in the special operations community read that book

1985
02:34:12.000 --> 02:34:16.70
You know when it came out and try to get the lessons earned and and definitely thought that it was

1986
02:34:17.40 --> 02:34:20.76
You know, I mean I thought it was a great book and

1987
02:34:21.60 --> 02:34:24.84
But again, I wasn't there. No, I think you did a good job

1988
02:34:24.84 --> 02:34:28.52
He put a lot into it. He did a lot of research and I think his intent was to tell it

1989
02:34:28.84 --> 02:34:33.36
That's truthfully as he could and I think he accomplished that and then and then the movie comes out

1990
02:34:33.36 --> 02:34:35.36
in

1991
02:34:35.36 --> 02:34:39.20
2001 December of 2001 the movie comes out so

1992
02:34:40.32 --> 02:34:44.48
I mean I think as far as combat movie goes combat movies go again

1993
02:34:44.48 --> 02:34:47.28
Is there some Hollywood stuff in there? They're sure is hell

1994
02:34:47.28 --> 02:34:52.000
Yeah, there's some stuff that's like not even close to accurate. Yes, there is but

1995
02:34:52.40 --> 02:34:58.04
That does a good job of conveying a lot of the chaos a lot of the mayhem a lot of the pressure that guys are under

1996
02:34:58.04 --> 02:35:03.80
So I don't know what you thought of that movie, but I think the same thing and in humanized some people

1997
02:35:03.80 --> 02:35:07.96
You know, it didn't portray everybody as the Avengers, you know that are invincible and you know

1998
02:35:08.20 --> 02:35:14.04
They're humans they make mistakes. They they they're there some that are just rock stars and others that

1999
02:35:14.36 --> 02:35:17.68
You know whether it's an experience or or what you know

2000
02:35:17.68 --> 02:35:22.68
Maybe aren't at that level of performance, but that's just reality so I think generally speaking

2001
02:35:22.68 --> 02:35:24.68
Yeah, I think most people are fairly happy with it

2002
02:35:24.68 --> 02:35:31.48
And it's it's the reason I wrote by book right I was about to ask you that so your book come came out in 2003 right so you must

2003
02:35:31.48 --> 02:35:35.84
To start writing that after those those Belkers was it to move your the book that made you

2004
02:35:35.84 --> 02:35:38.60
It was the movie. I mean, I want to see the movie and I I didn't go right away

2005
02:35:38.60 --> 02:35:41.72
Because I wasn't sure and what's this gonna feel like you know, I'm gonna watch my friends

2006
02:35:42.68 --> 02:35:44.68
Essentially die on screen

2007
02:35:45.08 --> 02:35:46.68
It actually seemed

2008
02:35:46.68 --> 02:35:51.24
Fake to me because the rafters so it didn't have the emotional impact that I thought it might have

2009
02:35:51.24 --> 02:35:56.84
For me and once it was over though because like I said that you know black-hawk down

2010
02:35:57.72 --> 02:36:03.36
The credits are rolling and I'm just basically waking up on my first day in captivity

2011
02:36:03.36 --> 02:36:10.16
So I thought there's never been a better time to kind of push this out than now and you know

2012
02:36:11.60 --> 02:36:17.32
Writing books in our world is a bit controversial to begin with right and and that's why I hadn't done it yet

2013
02:36:17.32 --> 02:36:23.40
But I thought look there's been a book. There's been a movie actually there are multiple books and it's all out there and

2014
02:36:23.80 --> 02:36:26.60
You know command you're the one to let it all out not me

2015
02:36:26.76 --> 02:36:31.84
So I'm just gonna tell my part of this story because if I don't tell it it's never gonna get told

2016
02:36:31.84 --> 02:36:33.84
It's I'm the only one that knows it and

2017
02:36:34.60 --> 02:36:38.80
So I felt good about doing it at that point in time, you know from an operational

2018
02:36:39.40 --> 02:36:42.92
Sensitivity perspective that you know stuff is all 10 years old. There's nothing there

2019
02:36:42.92 --> 02:36:47.88
But it's still you know it raises eyebrows here in there when you write a book and I understand

2020
02:36:47.88 --> 02:36:51.08
But I still feel to this day that it was the right thing to do

2021
02:36:51.40 --> 02:36:55.40
Yeah, it's impossible to write a book and trust me. I've written millennia

2022
02:36:55.40 --> 02:36:59.40
It's impossible right a book and and say well, you know

2023
02:36:59.88 --> 02:37:01.40
I'm doing this

2024
02:37:01.40 --> 02:37:04.68
I'm humble and I'm doing this because you're right no matter what you're writing a book

2025
02:37:04.68 --> 02:37:11.60
It's about you and so there's that there's that hypocrisy of doing that and I certainly like I had

2026
02:37:11.60 --> 02:37:14.32
You know my gut in knots because

2027
02:37:15.04 --> 02:37:18.80
Like you when I joined like you didn't talk about being in this hill teams for damn sure

2028
02:37:19.48 --> 02:37:24.20
One of one of my admiral friends helped me out get through that and you know

2029
02:37:24.36 --> 02:37:27.20
He said hey we're supposed to be quiet professionals

2030
02:37:27.60 --> 02:37:34.30
But that doesn't mean silent professionals and the stories and lessons there need to be carried on and you're doing a good job of that

2031
02:37:34.30 --> 02:37:38.48
And I was very thankful to hear that and I think that's accurate

2032
02:37:38.48 --> 02:37:44.68
What year did you what year did you or what time because you retired in 2001 right correct and

2033
02:37:46.24 --> 02:37:49.12
What month did you retire in 2001 February?

2034
02:37:49.88 --> 02:37:51.24
So

2035
02:37:51.24 --> 02:37:55.42
Okay, you know where I'm going with that so September 11th comes in your

2036
02:37:56.24 --> 02:37:59.68
You're in the bench and that's all I felt I mean really

2037
02:38:00.32 --> 02:38:06.08
But could could I have gone and flown to you know 18 hour combat infiltration and I've gannistered

2038
02:38:06.08 --> 02:38:10.96
I couldn't have done I'd have been asking them to drop me off somewhere in the mountains halfway through

2039
02:38:10.96 --> 02:38:18.08
You know because by back it just I can't sit that long not not in those seats so it was hard because I knew

2040
02:38:18.48 --> 02:38:24.20
You know the things that have gone on in this way as just you know you personally experience in the last 20 years

2041
02:38:24.32 --> 02:38:28.52
You can't even begin to describe it all. It's just unbelievable and

2042
02:38:29.84 --> 02:38:33.76
I did feel like I was I missed the boat because it's you know

2043
02:38:33.76 --> 02:38:35.12
It's our super bowl. I

2044
02:38:35.12 --> 02:38:40.24
Don't think people who don't serve in military really understand why you want to go do that stuff, but

2045
02:38:41.08 --> 02:38:48.32
It's it's it's you're super bowl. I mean this why it's you strive your whole career to get involved in that kind of stuff and

2046
02:38:49.52 --> 02:38:54.64
It was tough, but I also knew there was a lot of very capable guys that could do a better night could so

2047
02:38:56.000 --> 02:38:59.12
So once you retired you went in the corporate world for a bit

2048
02:38:59.12 --> 02:39:06.56
I did I went to work on a brand new helicopter for the army the army was buying a command sheet and it was pretty cool

2049
02:39:06.56 --> 02:39:10.52
I mean it's you know fast stealth the high tech

2050
02:39:11.12 --> 02:39:13.12
But it was a train wreck

2051
02:39:14.000 --> 02:39:16.72
You know we don't do very well with major acquisition

2052
02:39:16.72 --> 02:39:18.72
I'm sorry it's it's it's

2053
02:39:18.72 --> 02:39:20.32
When you think about you know

2054
02:39:20.72 --> 02:39:25.28
100 years ago we could do things with a slide rule or or whatever and today

2055
02:39:25.28 --> 02:39:30.16
We have all this technology and we can't keep anything on track. It's somewhat mind-boggling, but

2056
02:39:30.96 --> 02:39:36.64
That there's a whole list of reasons why that program was was in bad shape by the time I got there

2057
02:39:37.04 --> 02:39:41.52
But it was a good exposure to getting involved in in a government program office and how things

2058
02:39:42.88 --> 02:39:45.36
Work and most of them actually don't work

2059
02:39:46.000 --> 02:39:52.04
You know and as a taxpayer pretty frustrating to see what was being spent and what we were again for it. It's it's horrible

2060
02:39:52.04 --> 02:39:55.48
Yeah, and during that time you also wrote another book

2061
02:39:56.12 --> 02:40:02.44
Called just called the night stalker's right which is like the more of a historical account of the night stalkers right

2062
02:40:02.44 --> 02:40:09.64
It's just a select series of missions that were kind of from that same time frame and a little before and the whole idea there was to

2063
02:40:10.28 --> 02:40:11.88
Sort of articulate that

2064
02:40:11.88 --> 02:40:17.56
It's it's not just the same unit. It's the same guys. I mean there are people that have been there, you know

2065
02:40:17.56 --> 02:40:21.08
24 years and have been involved in all these real world ops and and

2066
02:40:21.08 --> 02:40:26.68
And again, I don't think the average person can even get their head around that that that you know those

2067
02:40:27.56 --> 02:40:31.96
Individuals contributed so much over such a long period of time. It's just unbelievable

2068
02:40:32.84 --> 02:40:36.92
And it did fairly well didn't nearly as well as in the company heroes did but

2069
02:40:37.64 --> 02:40:43.40
You know, I think it gave just some more insight into the DNA of this kind of unit, you know from an aviation perspective

2070
02:40:43.56 --> 02:40:46.44
It's essentially a seal-ty. I mean, it's you know

2071
02:40:46.60 --> 02:40:50.04
It's from a culture and commitment to mission and all that stuff

2072
02:40:50.04 --> 02:40:55.000
The mission's different but the personalities we don't live wait nearly as much

2073
02:40:55.08 --> 02:41:00.68
But we don't have we don't have toys any anywhere close to the biggest year toy. So it's expensive is your toys

2074
02:41:01.000 --> 02:41:04.44
Yeah, we always joke about the fact that like our budget is

2075
02:41:05.32 --> 02:41:10.52
So small compared to you know the aviation community because of freaking and a black-ock

2076
02:41:10.84 --> 02:41:12.84
What was a black-ock cost?

2077
02:41:12.84 --> 02:41:15.80
Well the special ops configured ones were probably in the 45 range

2078
02:41:15.80 --> 02:41:19.80
Yeah, so and that's not a thousand so I had an awesome

2079
02:41:20.92 --> 02:41:28.20
Huey pilot from Vietnam on and he was talking about you know those guys were just flying in the hot LZs like it wasn't like without a second thought

2080
02:41:28.20 --> 02:41:30.20
They were rolling in there and

2081
02:41:31.000 --> 02:41:35.56
He said something like well, you know you hear here. I was you know 18 years old and

2082
02:41:36.12 --> 02:41:38.28
Flying in and I got a

2083
02:41:39.16 --> 02:41:43.64
Whatever it was here got like a hundred thousand dollar aircraft. That's all mine

2084
02:41:43.64 --> 02:41:49.88
And I said you know and we started talking I said is that why it's more cautious with the black-ocks

2085
02:41:50.20 --> 02:41:51.56
Because there's so much more expensive

2086
02:41:51.56 --> 02:41:55.96
He goes yeah, I guess they must be more careful those things must cost like $250,000

2087
02:41:56.68 --> 02:42:00.36
I didn't I I knew it was more than that

2088
02:42:01.000 --> 02:42:03.72
But I said I think it's quite a bit more than that sir

2089
02:42:03.72 --> 02:42:08.76
He said oh really how much over a million I forget the conversation but it was funny, but yeah

2090
02:42:08.76 --> 02:42:12.84
For I mean a normal I ended up looking it up a normal black-ock not even a special spec off

2091
02:42:12.84 --> 02:42:19.56
Someone is like 20 million 24 million so yeah the prices went up a bit and and you actually

2092
02:42:20.76 --> 02:42:25.64
Once you got done, you know working with that first company you founded your own company

2093
02:42:25.64 --> 02:42:30.92
I did there was one other company in between but it just got me a little bit more experience in the corporate world than then

2094
02:42:31.16 --> 02:42:32.44
2008

2095
02:42:32.44 --> 02:42:35.56
I was working for a publicly traded company and you know

2096
02:42:35.56 --> 02:42:40.52
I know you've worked with a lot of different companies, but in terms of culture the the biggest

2097
02:42:40.52 --> 02:42:46.68
Disconnect for me personally as a former special ops guy is a publicly traded company because it's

2098
02:42:47.08 --> 02:42:50.92
It's all about the profits. I mean it, you know there's good companies out there don't get me wrong

2099
02:42:50.92 --> 02:42:56.12
But when when you're reporting financials every single day

2100
02:42:56.12 --> 02:42:59.000
I mean we got to the point we're not doing a quarterly we're doing a really day

2101
02:42:59.80 --> 02:43:01.16
I'm

2102
02:43:01.16 --> 02:43:06.92
Are you people insane? I mean I can't do what I'm supposed to be doing for the company if all I'm doing is looking at the numbers

2103
02:43:06.92 --> 02:43:14.68
So I got very very disgusted by it and I thought okay, I've got enough experience. I can do this myself and I started pinnacle in 2008

2104
02:43:14.68 --> 02:43:17.000
And then what's that? What's the focus there?

2105
02:43:17.000 --> 02:43:21.64
So we're an aerospace company we we initially you know, I mean it was me and one other guy

2106
02:43:21.64 --> 02:43:28.12
So we started out with nothing other than a good idea and a powerpoint briefing and it's it's kind of hard

2107
02:43:28.12 --> 02:43:34.12
I mean you know a true start-up like that in the defense contracting world is very difficult

2108
02:43:34.12 --> 02:43:39.96
I mean most fail because it takes a long time to get contracts and if you have no past performance then

2109
02:43:40.28 --> 02:43:43.16
You know why is anyone gonna give you any work?

2110
02:43:43.16 --> 02:43:47.32
But we got some and we built on it built on it built on it and now today

2111
02:43:48.04 --> 02:43:51.32
I describe us as a we do everything in the aviation

2112
02:43:51.88 --> 02:43:58.04
Industry except build the aircraft so if you think about maintenance flight operations engineering logistics

2113
02:43:58.68 --> 02:44:00.68
technical publications

2114
02:44:00.68 --> 02:44:03.000
You know all of it we do all of that

2115
02:44:03.000 --> 02:44:09.80
For predominantly helicopters, but we do that tilt rotor for the for air force special operations command

2116
02:44:10.04 --> 02:44:13.24
We do some fixed wingwork for the air force we get some international contracts

2117
02:44:13.64 --> 02:44:16.68
So we've really gone way beyond what I originally

2118
02:44:17.08 --> 02:44:22.52
You know because you write the business plan and we're not gonna be in five years and and it's it's a fairy tale

2119
02:44:22.68 --> 02:44:27.96
Really for most cases especially a true start-up because you don't know if you're even gonna get any traction

2120
02:44:27.96 --> 02:44:33.88
So but we're so far beyond that now how big are you know in terms of employees so well a lot of workforce

2121
02:44:33.88 --> 02:44:37.80
It's close to 600 by the end of the year and you know again in

2122
02:44:39.000 --> 02:44:43.08
Five years what did I think we would have I don't know I probably put that have to go back and look at it

2123
02:44:43.08 --> 02:44:49.72
You know 25 people something like that so it's enough people where we got it we have a a human resources problem pretty much every day

2124
02:44:52.12 --> 02:44:56.44
That's the fun stuff yeah, so here you are how many how many years you end up doing in the army?

2125
02:44:56.44 --> 02:45:03.72
It's 22 so you did 22 years in the army you are a damn POW you if you flew the best

2126
02:45:04.28 --> 02:45:11.24
You know helicopters for the best unit in the world as far as aviation goes you end up retiring from that

2127
02:45:11.32 --> 02:45:15.24
You're working to civilian sector for a while you build this business up to a

2128
02:45:15.96 --> 02:45:17.96
significant business

2129
02:45:17.96 --> 02:45:24.60
I would think maybe you're you're saying yourself okay, maybe it's time to you know pump the brakes a little bit and take a little time for myself

2130
02:45:24.60 --> 02:45:28.92
But it turns out you're actually doing the exact opposite. I'm doing the exact opposite and

2131
02:45:29.48 --> 02:45:34.76
You know it's it was a tough decision because I was the runway I was lined up on as I

2132
02:45:35.000 --> 02:45:37.000
Describe it was

2133
02:45:37.000 --> 02:45:39.48
Retire our youngest is graduating high school this year

2134
02:45:40.12 --> 02:45:44.60
You know the company's done well. I can do whatever I want you know in the in the famous words

2135
02:45:44.60 --> 02:45:48.52
It was an Elon Musk who said I could be on the beach drinking my ties every day

2136
02:45:48.76 --> 02:45:51.48
But you know I want to make a difference so I

2137
02:45:51.48 --> 02:45:58.04
I decided to run for Senate and I think you're getting that sentiment from a lot of

2138
02:45:58.60 --> 02:46:06.12
Veterans because you know veterans have seen the sacrifice that people who served this nation have made and then you see things like the way

2139
02:46:06.12 --> 02:46:12.84
I've can't understand was thrown away and you see the way the southern borders be inhaled and you see this mandatory vaccine mandate and you know

2140
02:46:13.08 --> 02:46:18.36
You in particular where you hear speculation that seals are gonna have to pay for their tried-ins and turn them in

2141
02:46:18.36 --> 02:46:23.32
If they don't want to get the shot, I mean that's absolutely ridiculous and it just

2142
02:46:23.80 --> 02:46:27.72
You know you can sit there and complain about it or you can actually try to do something about it

2143
02:46:28.04 --> 02:46:33.88
And I thought I feel the same way today that I felt in 2008 when I was working for that publicly traded company

2144
02:46:33.88 --> 02:46:37.24
And I couldn't stand the way it was being run so that I could do this better myself

2145
02:46:37.24 --> 02:46:41.88
So I kind of have I feel that same way I can do this better than other people that are doing it

2146
02:46:41.88 --> 02:46:46.84
And I've met a lot of folks recently through trips to DC and you know initially when you look at them

2147
02:46:46.84 --> 02:46:50.36
Some of them sound intelligent and a lot of them are don't get me wrong

2148
02:46:50.52 --> 02:46:54.36
But if you meet them and you find out what's really behind the curtain

2149
02:46:54.84 --> 02:47:02.12
It's it's a little scary. We need we need more people with true life experience is not career politicians people who you know

2150
02:47:02.12 --> 02:47:09.64
This is not for me. I'm not going there to you know be in office for the rest of my life. I'm going there to try to make a difference and

2151
02:47:10.68 --> 02:47:12.68
I really don't think you can understand

2152
02:47:14.68 --> 02:47:16.68
military policy

2153
02:47:16.68 --> 02:47:22.04
In business policy unless you've actually done it and a lot of these people have not done it

2154
02:47:22.04 --> 02:47:26.60
I mean they they've studied it or maybe they think they know it but but they really don't

2155
02:47:26.60 --> 02:47:30.20
I mean you look at some of the dialogue going on right now about Ukraine, you know some

2156
02:47:30.52 --> 02:47:33.32
Our congressman said yesterday, you know, we would use nuclear weapons

2157
02:47:36.28 --> 02:47:40.12
These people don't know what they're talking about you know and you got to have somebody that

2158
02:47:40.12 --> 02:47:46.84
Can maybe apply the voice of reason now now you know Alabama is a very red state so in our state

2159
02:47:46.84 --> 02:47:48.84
It's all about win in the primary and

2160
02:47:49.000 --> 02:47:56.04
You know that's in me this this coming year and if that happens it's pretty much a guarantee you win the general and then

2161
02:47:56.28 --> 02:47:58.60
Start serving in February of 23

2162
02:47:58.84 --> 02:48:02.60
What was the how how did this start off in your brain?

2163
02:48:02.60 --> 02:48:04.20
But also how did start off?

2164
02:48:04.20 --> 02:48:06.20
What do you do do you?

2165
02:48:06.20 --> 02:48:07.32
Do you call 1-800?

2166
02:48:07.32 --> 02:48:09.72
I want to run for senate like how does that work?

2167
02:48:09.72 --> 02:48:13.000
Can that some people do and it doesn't go very well, you know

2168
02:48:14.04 --> 02:48:20.92
But no I was asked to consider and the reason I was asked to consider it is because I do have that real world experience

2169
02:48:21.24 --> 02:48:25.000
And I have it has to be dusted off a little bit but I have name recognition

2170
02:48:25.000 --> 02:48:27.48
I mean there's a lot of veterans in Alabama

2171
02:48:28.04 --> 02:48:31.48
There's a lot of people that remember this story there's a huge aviation presence

2172
02:48:32.36 --> 02:48:33.80
And having that

2173
02:48:33.80 --> 02:48:35.80
Resume plus the business resume

2174
02:48:35.80 --> 02:48:41.96
Is it real it's very very appealing to the average Alabama voter and

2175
02:48:42.20 --> 02:48:48.28
The fact that you know, I'm not a career politician people are looking for our different answer

2176
02:48:48.28 --> 02:48:52.12
I mean you look at Glen yonken you know big part of why he won is

2177
02:48:52.92 --> 02:48:56.28
He's he's a fresh face with a new idea and real world experience

2178
02:48:56.52 --> 02:49:00.52
It's the same thing Tommy Tuberville our current senator who I would serve with

2179
02:49:01.000 --> 02:49:03.40
Coach of Auburn football, you know, it's the same thing

2180
02:49:03.40 --> 02:49:07.56
Never been above addition before I think initially when he announced people were like

2181
02:49:07.96 --> 02:49:11.32
Coach T I mean but I've met with him. He's doing an awesome job

2182
02:49:11.64 --> 02:49:15.48
He really works hard to understand the process and he cares about the state, you know

2183
02:49:15.80 --> 02:49:19.64
That's what it should be all about it shouldn't be about trying to further your own political career

2184
02:49:19.64 --> 02:49:24.04
It should be I'm here to serve the people of Alabama and the nation because as a senator

2185
02:49:24.60 --> 02:49:27.80
There's a lot there. I mean you know the things that you vote on

2186
02:49:27.80 --> 02:49:32.84
Matter across the board and I think we got to have people there that have you know

2187
02:49:33.48 --> 02:49:36.44
Integrity and you know there for the right reasons and that's why I'm doing but

2188
02:49:37.64 --> 02:49:40.36
I could be nuts. I mean it's not fun

2189
02:49:41.48 --> 02:49:43.48
Well, yeah, I definitely think you're not so you know

2190
02:49:43.48 --> 02:49:47.64
When you're talking about the meeting these politicians for some of them that are up there

2191
02:49:48.20 --> 02:49:49.40
We did a

2192
02:49:49.40 --> 02:49:56.36
Probably too long of a podcast. I did a series of like five or six podcasts about this book that I've read called

2193
02:49:56.36 --> 02:50:01.40
The Psychology of Military and Complidence and it's written by a guy that was a

2194
02:50:01.96 --> 02:50:06.44
Psychologist but he was also a guy that served in World War II the book was published in maybe

2195
02:50:07.88 --> 02:50:11.88
For five or something like this but one of the key points in it that it talks about is

2196
02:50:12.92 --> 02:50:16.36
One of the reasons why and he he does the same thing that you just did

2197
02:50:16.36 --> 02:50:19.88
Which is not he's not talking about everybody he points that out over and over again in the book

2198
02:50:19.88 --> 02:50:24.28
There's plenty of military personnel that are awesome that are great leaders. They're outstanding

2199
02:50:24.28 --> 02:50:31.40
But there are also people that are in the military that are horrible leaders and they're toxic leaders and

2200
02:50:31.64 --> 02:50:35.16
One of the key components that he talks about is the of authoritarian mindset

2201
02:50:35.80 --> 02:50:43.24
So what the problem is with the military is it gonna attract people if I'm a if I have an authoritarian mindset

2202
02:50:43.24 --> 02:50:47.000
Up foritarian psychology. I want people to listen to me and I want things to be an order

2203
02:50:47.48 --> 02:50:52.92
So what better way to to make that happen than to join the military becoming officer people have to listen to me

2204
02:50:52.92 --> 02:50:54.92
And things will be an order and

2205
02:50:55.48 --> 02:51:00.92
And then inside the military as we know if I never go into combat and all I have to do is

2206
02:51:01.16 --> 02:51:06.20
Keep the keep the the the the uniform squared away and keep my area clean

2207
02:51:06.20 --> 02:51:09.48
I'm gonna get promoted because I'm gonna run things like an authoritarian now

2208
02:51:09.48 --> 02:51:13.64
I'm horrible in combat because I can't control everything and it drives me crazy and I freak out

2209
02:51:14.44 --> 02:51:17.72
But it attracts that kind of person and then you know

2210
02:51:17.72 --> 02:51:24.28
Just as you were talking about being in the government and being in a being in a position where you're in control of things

2211
02:51:24.76 --> 02:51:29.24
It can unfortunately attract the same kind of deranged of

2212
02:51:29.40 --> 02:51:34.28
Foritarians that want to go in there and control everything and so I think that's coming

2213
02:51:34.28 --> 02:51:39.000
I think we're seeing a lot of that right now a lot of the government that is looking around going oh wait

2214
02:51:39.000 --> 02:51:44.12
This is an opportunity for for us for me to become even more authoritarian about what's happening in the world

2215
02:51:44.36 --> 02:51:47.000
I can control more we can mandate things and

2216
02:51:47.000 --> 02:51:53.48
And I think you're in a position where I think a lot of people are starting to push back against that and want to

2217
02:51:53.96 --> 02:51:55.96
Go through life and

2218
02:51:55.96 --> 02:52:00.20
Have freedom individual freedom which is the thing that makes this country great in the first place

2219
02:52:02.28 --> 02:52:07.48
Well, how did your wife feel about it so she is obviously the first person I spoke to that must have been a fun

2220
02:52:07.48 --> 02:52:08.28
conversation

2221
02:52:08.28 --> 02:52:13.64
You know she's not a very public person and and I thought she's gonna shoot me down right there. I mean I

2222
02:52:13.64 --> 02:52:18.28
I was shocked at her reaction and she said

2223
02:52:19.40 --> 02:52:21.88
You know if you think you can make a difference. I support you all the way and

2224
02:52:23.16 --> 02:52:28.60
It kind of reminded me of the conversation about starting the business. I brought the kids in because they were still young and you know

2225
02:52:28.60 --> 02:52:31.32
You're giving up your job. You have put your house up for collateral

2226
02:52:31.32 --> 02:52:36.20
I mean the bank doesn't write you a check and say good luck, you know and so I brought the kids and I said

2227
02:52:36.20 --> 02:52:39.32
I'm gonna go do this now you gotta understand if this fails

2228
02:52:39.32 --> 02:52:45.40
We're gonna be living in a box and they still remember they remember they're living in a box conversation

2229
02:52:45.40 --> 02:52:47.40
So you know I think as long as you

2230
02:52:48.04 --> 02:52:50.04
Understand the risks you understand

2231
02:52:50.04 --> 02:52:53.88
You know when when it gets near the end the negative ads are gonna come

2232
02:52:53.88 --> 02:52:56.68
I mean people are gonna bash you on social media

2233
02:52:56.68 --> 02:52:59.000
You can't avoid it. I mean doesn't matter who you are

2234
02:52:59.24 --> 02:53:02.44
It's someone is gonna be against you and unfortunately there's lots of

2235
02:53:03.40 --> 02:53:06.44
ways that people can communicate that today and

2236
02:53:06.44 --> 02:53:09.16
I had my first hate mail and the

2237
02:53:10.28 --> 02:53:18.28
And the letters to the editor this weekend in our hometown newspaper and I even read it and and my campaign team said

2238
02:53:18.28 --> 02:53:21.24
That's a victory. He's they said you're gonna eat free publicity

2239
02:53:21.24 --> 02:53:25.48
You know you're never gonna get everyone to say that they align with you, but you know

2240
02:53:25.80 --> 02:53:27.80
It doesn't bother you don't honestly doesn't bother me

2241
02:53:28.84 --> 02:53:35.56
But I someone asked me what's the biggest difference and I said you know in the world a week come from which is always gonna be me

2242
02:53:35.56 --> 02:53:37.56
I will never not be that person

2243
02:53:38.12 --> 02:53:40.52
You can trust everybody on your team. I mean

2244
02:53:41.08 --> 02:53:45.96
There's a players and there's a player but you still trust them. They're not gonna turn on you

2245
02:53:47.08 --> 02:53:53.32
In this world that I'm getting into you can't trust anyone. I mean even I mean my own team tells me

2246
02:53:53.56 --> 02:53:56.20
Don't trust anyone if you have a conversation with somebody

2247
02:53:56.84 --> 02:54:01.40
Assume they're gonna go and stab you in the back with whether information you provide

2248
02:54:01.72 --> 02:54:04.92
So it's a very different world you know your guards up all the time

2249
02:54:04.92 --> 02:54:08.92
But you know, I mean somebody's got to do it and

2250
02:54:09.72 --> 02:54:12.20
There's a lot less qualified people than me

2251
02:54:15.48 --> 02:54:17.48
That have been successful

2252
02:54:18.68 --> 02:54:22.04
Man so for people to support you in this

2253
02:54:22.04 --> 02:54:28.60
I know I looked at your you got Mike Durant dot com that's that's where people can go they can learn more about you

2254
02:54:29.40 --> 02:54:32.76

2255
02:54:32.76 --> 02:54:35.48
Which were you on social media before?

2256
02:54:36.12 --> 02:54:39.40

This is the world right this is the world right now and people are people are crazy and

2260
02:54:49.80 --> 02:54:55.56
They're not even crazy. They're just gonna say things to you to see if they can get you to get you to respond one time or get some

2261
02:54:55.56 --> 02:54:57.56
I wrote tweet or whatever

02:54:57.56 --> 02:55:01.40
So I look forward to watching you navigate this

2263
02:55:01.40 --> 02:55:03.40
Thank you

2264
02:55:04.92 --> 02:55:12.44
You're on Twitter Mike Durant AL so Alabama Mike Durant AL Instagram same thing Mike Durant AL

2265
02:55:13.24 --> 02:55:16.20

Which is Mike Durant for Senate where people can learn more about you as you as you

2267
02:55:25.88 --> 02:55:29.40
Go forward in this crazy place which again

2268
02:55:29.40 --> 02:55:32.84
I think at some point you're at least gonna think to yourself maybe the

2269
02:55:33.56 --> 02:55:40.84
Join an Elon Musk with my ties on the beach would have been a better call. Yeah, I'm sure there will be several moments like that for sure

2270
02:55:40.84 --> 02:55:42.36
But but to your point

2271
02:55:42.36 --> 02:55:47.000
Listen this this country you know again we've we're now of a son we're talking about

2272
02:55:47.48 --> 02:55:48.84
We're talking about

2273
02:55:48.84 --> 02:55:53.08
Fighting Russia for in Ukraine that's that's that's discussions that are happening right now

2274
02:55:53.48 --> 02:55:55.88
We've got the problems at the border

2275
02:55:55.88 --> 02:56:01.96
We've got problems with our our unrest in the country there's so many issues that

2276
02:56:03.96 --> 02:56:10.20
I just for you to be stepping up to this way. Thank you. Thank you for stepping up. I know it's a terrible drag and

2277
02:56:11.80 --> 02:56:19.08
But somebody's got to do it so there's a there's a man in the arena speech in my book which from the moment I first read it

2278
02:56:19.88 --> 02:56:21.08
To me

2279
02:56:21.08 --> 02:56:25.48
Really defines why I'm doing it. You know, I don't want and again it goes back to 2008

2280
02:56:25.48 --> 02:56:29.48
Why I started the business I didn't want to sit on my porch at

2281
02:56:29.48 --> 02:56:31.80
75 thinking what if you know

2282
02:56:32.20 --> 02:56:36.84
You got to you got to take the leap you got to you know take the chance right at these edge of what you're comfortable with and

2283
02:56:37.48 --> 02:56:42.12
I'm you know succeed or fail. I'm not gonna have any regrets. Mm-hmm. Yep. Awesome

2284
02:56:42.84 --> 02:56:44.20
Echo Charles. Yes

2285
02:56:44.60 --> 02:56:48.12
Do you have any questions. Oh, yeah, you mentioned your back a few times

2286
02:56:48.92 --> 02:56:53.32
Like what how's it now where where on your back was it jammed up so it's L

2287
02:56:53.32 --> 02:56:58.20
Three I think it is and it's anyway down the kind of like a third of the way up

2288
02:56:59.32 --> 02:57:05.56
It's kind of a miracle actually the only thing I can't do and and because don't bust me on this is I can't pull weeds at the house

2289
02:57:07.88 --> 02:57:09.88
Something about my back

2290
02:57:13.72 --> 02:57:20.76
But pretty much anything else you know, I stay active because I'm a big believer that you got to keep the juices flowing as soon as you stop

2291
02:57:20.76 --> 02:57:28.76
First of all I'm 60 so you know things things started to deteriorate pretty fast that when you when you reach that point in life

2292
02:57:29.08 --> 02:57:35.18
So I still I run I live weights I was playing hockey until just recently and you know

2293
02:57:35.18 --> 02:57:36.18
Stay an active

2294
02:57:36.18 --> 02:57:40.60
Got into climate some mountains this year I can think I climb five four teenagers in Colorado this summer

2295
02:57:41.08 --> 02:57:43.08
So you know just you just got to stay moving and

2296
02:57:44.84 --> 02:57:49.46
Staying strong is the key to a back issue no question, but you know

2297
02:57:49.46 --> 02:57:55.22
I already know and then I'll get it I get some kind of muscled problem it'll lock up and you know last three or four days

2298
02:57:55.22 --> 02:57:59.02
But you know I try not to overdo it and and so far

2299
02:57:59.70 --> 02:58:05.32
It's hanging in there. Yeah, that's so crazy because there are people who have not broke their back

2300
02:58:05.52 --> 02:58:09.98
Who will have major back problems in the 60 year 50 whatever?

2301
02:58:09.98 --> 02:58:14.46
Yeah, same saying it's crazy got to stay on the path got to in all forms

2302
02:58:14.46 --> 02:58:20.74
My look we covered you know again the wave tops of your book the wave tops are your life

2303
02:58:21.82 --> 02:58:24.26
Is there anything else any other closing thoughts?

2304
02:58:25.92 --> 02:58:28.92
Well, first of all very much enjoyed reading

2305
02:58:30.34 --> 02:58:37.52
Your book I agree with it. I mean and it's funny because I think I mentioned when I first walked into building today

2306
02:58:37.74 --> 02:58:42.42
Some of the some of the lessons learned in there. I applied this morning. You know because we did a management meeting

2307
02:58:42.42 --> 02:58:47.42
Over the phone over teams we do a a bi-weekly

2308
02:58:47.70 --> 02:58:53.02
Where we just get everybody at the speed on what's going on and and you know is all about just simplifying the message

2309
02:58:53.02 --> 02:58:55.50
You know because if you think about it from a

2310
02:58:56.22 --> 02:58:58.92
Worker at the point of the spear is perspective that really helps

2311
02:58:59.22 --> 02:59:06.44
You know that that's where the message needs to resonate and if I might understand it or the legal guy may understand it

2312
02:59:06.44 --> 02:59:10.10
But that guy or gal out there like what they all are they talking about you know

2313
02:59:10.10 --> 02:59:14.86
So I and I think because of my background that's just natural for me

2314
02:59:14.86 --> 02:59:19.14
I mean I don't a blue collar guy we we lived in a trailer, you know

2315
02:59:19.14 --> 02:59:23.74
I mean my parents both working class people I left home with $70

2316
02:59:23.94 --> 02:59:27.26
You know, I was a private I've mopped the latrine

2317
02:59:27.26 --> 02:59:32.94
You know I I don't have to pretend to understand that perspective. I've lived it

2318
02:59:32.94 --> 02:59:40.98
So I think that really helps and I don't know how you could get everyone to experience that because I think it's invaluable and

2319
02:59:41.26 --> 02:59:47.42
There's been some great leaders who never experienced that but I think we're often not having that

2320
02:59:47.94 --> 02:59:52.86
Humbling sort of meager beginning really really gives you a better perspective on how to

2321
02:59:53.18 --> 02:59:57.06
How to lead people because because as you say it's all about trust

2322
02:59:57.30 --> 02:59:59.30
It's all about respect

2323
02:59:59.30 --> 03:00:04.50
It's all about you know keeping it simple all those things that you know if you've come up from that

2324
03:00:05.58 --> 03:00:07.58
part of the the ecosystem

2325
03:00:08.70 --> 03:00:11.06
Maybe come natural to you by the way

2326
03:00:11.42 --> 03:00:15.62
Doug Brown you reminded me when you said about your commander who told you about

2327
03:00:15.94 --> 03:00:17.06
You know

2328
03:00:17.06 --> 03:00:22.70
Where the quiet professionals not the sound professionals he is and he may he probably doesn't remember that and and

2329
03:00:22.70 --> 03:00:26.70
And wouldn't likely deny it but I talked to him about writing this book and

2330
03:00:26.70 --> 03:00:31.10
He said no one's gonna give you our time right now, but you know at that at that point

2331
03:00:31.38 --> 03:00:34.02
The movie's out books out. I'm out and retired

2332
03:00:34.18 --> 03:00:38.50
You know and and so if he gave me the endorsement that was good

2333
03:00:38.50 --> 03:00:41.04
You're gonna get it because at that point he's forced our general right yeah

2334
03:00:41.04 --> 03:00:43.70
I mean, I've read so many books on this podcast from

2335
03:00:44.18 --> 03:00:47.54
From some private soldier that fought in

2336
03:00:48.46 --> 03:00:51.34
Korea from a guy that served in Vietnam

2337
03:00:51.34 --> 03:00:57.02
It just and and there's so many lessons to learn and not only is it lessons to learn

2338
03:00:57.22 --> 03:01:03.74
But it's also capturing the history and the and the stories of the service and sacrifice of all these people

2339
03:01:03.74 --> 03:01:10.22
So I think that's probably where general Brown was coming from you know looking at you thinking about what you've been through me now

2340
03:01:10.94 --> 03:01:15.32
We don't have we don't have any other buddy that we don't have anyone else that can tell that story

2341
03:01:15.32 --> 03:01:18.78
They don't exist so for you to for you

2342
03:01:18.78 --> 03:01:22.58
Put that word out. I'm sure general Brown was thinking look it's not just

2343
03:01:23.34 --> 03:01:31.04
Not just people won't say anything in 30 years in 40 years people are gonna be so thankful that you wrote that book because now

2344
03:01:31.04 --> 03:01:34.98
We have a document that's that can explain everything that you learned and

2345
03:01:35.46 --> 03:01:46.16
Explain the incredible sacrifices of of the the troops that served alongside with you and and fought and sacrificed their lives for their team and I think

2346
03:01:46.16 --> 03:01:52.40
That's not only is it that that needs to be done and it was a healing process

2347
03:01:52.40 --> 03:01:56.52
I don't think I touched on that earlier, but when it was over it it felt like I

2348
03:01:56.88 --> 03:02:01.32
Just did something I was supposed to do you know and it felt like just getting it all out

2349
03:02:02.04 --> 03:02:07.20
Was was part of a recovery which which I don't think you ever fully recover from this

2350
03:02:07.20 --> 03:02:12.000
I mean it depends on how you define recover, but you know to think that emotionally

2351
03:02:12.000 --> 03:02:17.72
I'm not affected at all by what happened there is a false I mean I you just can't help it every now and then

2352
03:02:17.72 --> 03:02:19.92
There's a wave that comes over that's grief, you know

2353
03:02:19.92 --> 03:02:23.76
I mean these are these are your family and they're gone. Yeah, you know

2354
03:02:23.76 --> 03:02:30.64
I had a I'm the same way you know losing my guys and it's just horrible and you know

2355
03:02:30.64 --> 03:02:32.64
Sometimes I think well

2356
03:02:32.64 --> 03:02:38.28
How long is that last for and I had a guy on the podcast named Colonel Tom Fife who was he fought in

2357
03:02:38.28 --> 03:02:45.84
World War II Korea and Vietnam and he received a purple heart in World War II Korea and Vietnam

2358
03:02:45.84 --> 03:02:50.40
And we were on the podcast we talked about World War II we talked about Korea

2359
03:02:50.40 --> 03:02:54.56
We talked about Vietnam and he was a baton commander in Vietnam, you know, infantry batton commander

2360
03:02:54.56 --> 03:03:00.16
And we were talking about their optimal and operations that what they were doing and and I asked him about

2361
03:03:00.76 --> 03:03:05.96
You know the casualties that he took in his battalion and as I asked him that

2362
03:03:05.96 --> 03:03:10.92
I saw he almost immediately started getting choked up and emotional and

2363
03:03:11.56 --> 03:03:16.76
That's when I realized to myself I thought to myself. Oh, I'm always gonna feel like this

2364
03:03:16.76 --> 03:03:19.76
It's always gonna be there so like you said I

2365
03:03:20.12 --> 03:03:25.46
You know, I don't think you don't get over it and probably not healthy to get over it

2366
03:03:25.46 --> 03:03:33.36
Like how can you forget your friends? It's never gonna happen and I do think that writing about these things has helped me a ton and talking about them has helped me a ton

2367
03:03:33.36 --> 03:03:37.40
The the the act of writing when you write something you

2368
03:03:38.24 --> 03:03:44.08
De facto detach from it, you know, you you read the words that you wrote and it you get a little separation

2369
03:03:44.08 --> 03:03:51.36
You can kind of process it more so I think the writing is therapeutic and does help move people forward and

2370
03:03:51.36 --> 03:03:56.88
Helps you process what you've been through and in a in the most positive way that I can think of

2371
03:03:57.12 --> 03:04:02.52
Because then other people get to see and get to read and hear and understand more clearly

2372
03:04:02.52 --> 03:04:07.74
What you've been through and also the sacrifices that were made. Yeah, and you know

2373
03:04:07.74 --> 03:04:11.56
It's like some books are critical of the military or whatever

2374
03:04:11.56 --> 03:04:17.24
There's nothing there's not a bad thing in there about but and yeah, there's some bad things it happened by the way

2375
03:04:17.24 --> 03:04:19.24
Some of that language is kind of flowery

2376
03:04:21.64 --> 03:04:25.40
And that is Stephen, okay. That is not me none of those flowery where it's gay

2377
03:04:27.32 --> 03:04:31.52
Yeah, it's good to have you know somebody that helped you out write it and kind of

2378
03:04:31.52 --> 03:04:37.84
Clare or fry some stuff and add some words that you know you didn't learn when you were living in a trailer new hamper

2379
03:04:37.84 --> 03:04:42.000
Yeah, I don't know my mother would probably cringe if she knew I said we've lived in a trailer

2380
03:04:42.000 --> 03:04:44.000
Was this short period of time?

2381
03:04:44.000 --> 03:04:46.000
You know, we were just

2382
03:04:46.000 --> 03:04:49.60
And I didn't know the difference. I mean, I was a happy kid. Everybody lives in a trail

2383
03:04:50.48 --> 03:04:57.92
So it was there my upbringing was fantastic. I really had a great family to great part of the country to grow up in

2384
03:04:58.48 --> 03:04:59.84
Winter sports, you know

2385
03:04:59.84 --> 03:05:04.48
It's a I miss a lot that's so that's where the hockey comes from I started playing hockey when I was a kid

2386
03:05:04.48 --> 03:05:09.20
Yeah, people don't understand you drive through Massachusetts and there's hockey rings all over play stuff there

2387
03:05:09.20 --> 03:05:11.20
They're playing their hockey. That's for sure

2388
03:05:12.64 --> 03:05:14.64
Well

2389
03:05:14.72 --> 03:05:18.40
Like I said thank you thank you so much for coming on. Thank you for for

2390
03:05:19.28 --> 03:05:21.28
Sharing your stories sharing your lessons on it's

2391
03:05:22.000 --> 03:05:25.92
Thank you for what you're doing right now to to step up into the arena

2392
03:05:26.48 --> 03:05:27.68
That's a

2393
03:05:27.68 --> 03:05:34.72
To be a US senator that's a whole new battle a whole new different type of battle and thank you for doing it and most important

2394
03:05:35.20 --> 03:05:38.24
Thank you for your service and your sacrifice

2395
03:05:39.76 --> 03:05:46.72
For our great nation and finally and most important that we honor and salute the sacrifices of the brave men

2396
03:05:47.28 --> 03:05:54.64
Who fought alongside you and who made the ultimate sacrifice for their brothers and for our country

2397
03:05:54.64 --> 03:05:57.52
Thanks for joining us and it's been my pleasure and

2398
03:05:59.92 --> 03:06:02.96
With that Mike Durant has left the building

2399
03:06:04.32 --> 03:06:06.32
so

2400
03:06:06.40 --> 03:06:08.40
pretty

2401
03:06:08.000 --> 03:06:12.16
Pretty all kinds of crazyness going on there crazy

2402
03:06:12.80 --> 03:06:15.12
For me as I sat there and was looking at him

2403
03:06:15.84 --> 03:06:17.44
You know and I was always talking about

2404
03:06:17.44 --> 03:06:25.20
The the video that came out of him and that was everywhere and I was in the seal teams in special

2405
03:06:25.20 --> 03:06:32.40
Operations was hearing all the rumors and of everything that was going on and here I was watching him on TV

2406
03:06:33.60 --> 03:06:36.40
Was that 28 years ago and

2407
03:06:36.80 --> 03:06:40.32
Now we're sitting here talking to each other. He lived

2408
03:06:41.04 --> 03:06:42.80
He went on with his career

2409
03:06:42.80 --> 03:06:46.80
He lived he did everything that he did and now he's sitting in this room talking

2410
03:06:47.84 --> 03:06:50.48
Sharon history with us. That was

2411
03:06:51.44 --> 03:06:53.44
Yeah, I remember feeling that

2412
03:06:53.76 --> 03:06:56.24
Not quite all that but feeling that with um

2413
03:06:57.36 --> 03:06:59.36
Bill Reader and

2414
03:06:59.36 --> 03:07:03.36
He was like when you know you go through all this experience and you're like look at this guy

2415
03:07:03.36 --> 03:07:08.16
He's just sitting here right now just talking to me and that's what he went through and here he is

2416
03:07:08.16 --> 03:07:12.16
There he is right there, you know, but you're is even more because you were you remember that

2417
03:07:12.16 --> 03:07:18.96
Actually, I mean you were watching it. That's crazy. It is very crazy and then when you have all those names that overlap

2418
03:07:19.04 --> 03:07:21.04
You know whether it's general brown

2419
03:07:22.64 --> 03:07:27.84
Like that's crazy right general brown was his battalion commander who's talking to him on the radio

2420
03:07:28.48 --> 03:07:29.44
I

2421
03:07:29.44 --> 03:07:34.96
Was an admiral's aid sitting on an aircraft with general brown flying to some other country

2422
03:07:35.76 --> 03:07:40.32
Going into meetings in the Pentagon with general brown is the same guy. Yeah

2423
03:07:40.32 --> 03:07:47.28
Is the same guy Adam Curtis who was the guy that got rolled up in Panama with his wife

2424
03:07:48.96 --> 03:07:54.88
I worked for that guy. He was my task unit commander when I was an E5 in the single teams

2425
03:07:56.000 --> 03:07:58.000
The same procurement that's in that book

2426
03:07:59.84 --> 03:08:06.88
That caused the invasion of Panama to take place kind of yeah one of the one of the primary causes

2427
03:08:06.88 --> 03:08:12.80
Yeah, and kind of goes back to something that you said before a while ago where it's like those aren't

2428
03:08:13.52 --> 03:08:19.84
Can just characters in a story yeah, all right a movie or something. Yeah, and I said that early on in this podcast

2429
03:08:19.84 --> 03:08:23.12
Is it hey remember that when we're reading this book these people

2430
03:08:23.76 --> 03:08:29.12
These characters that you hear they're not characters. They're people and I guess you're right that's such a

2431
03:08:29.92 --> 03:08:34.08
Absolute clear connection to the fact that they're not just characters

2432
03:08:34.08 --> 03:08:36.08
There are people yeah

2433
03:08:37.44 --> 03:08:39.44
But also have mom for sure and

2434
03:08:41.76 --> 03:08:43.76
Man

2435
03:08:44.80 --> 03:08:47.84
What did it what a what a crazy battle the incredible incredible

2436
03:08:48.72 --> 03:08:50.16
incredible battle

2437
03:08:50.16 --> 03:08:52.16
Incredible sacrifices made on that day and

2438
03:08:54.000 --> 03:09:00.52
Yeah, makes us think of you know how good we have it you know like like Mike Durant pointed out you know

2439
03:09:00.52 --> 03:09:03.88
You'd meet the families and realize

2440
03:09:04.60 --> 03:09:07.56
Well if it wasn't for them he wouldn't be here. Yeah

2441
03:09:08.20 --> 03:09:12.76
So I think that's probably one of the things that drives him to continue to

2442
03:09:13.000 --> 03:09:15.000
But want to serve so

2443
03:09:16.20 --> 03:09:21.84
We got to continue we all have to continue continue to serve in whatever way possible

2444
03:09:23.08 --> 03:09:29.64
Also, I'll tell you what's impressive he's in good shape. Yeah, good shape. Yeah, even the like look at them

2445
03:09:29.64 --> 03:09:36.36
Yeah, like all okay this is 60 doing it. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, so I think that's a good

2446
03:09:37.88 --> 03:09:42.28
Probably a good thing for us all to think about if you want to maintain some sort of capability

2447
03:09:43.000 --> 03:09:49.56
Probably a good idea. It's true very true and as we mentioned before where hey have you ever broke your back?

2448
03:09:50.36 --> 03:09:57.40
No, I have not ever broke your love bar. Yeah, spine haven't crashed in a freaking in a in a black-all helicopter in an

2449
03:09:57.40 --> 03:10:01.000
Out-of-control black-hawk helicopter spinning to the earth

2450
03:10:01.48 --> 03:10:09.56
Compressing my spine breaking my femur having been dragged around by a mob of angry some always and beaten right after by the way, but right after that

2451
03:10:09.96 --> 03:10:11.96
You know, so you haven't

2452
03:10:11.96 --> 03:10:16.68
That has to be okay me neither as you you probably know me neither

2453
03:10:18.12 --> 03:10:22.68
But he still runs marijuana. Have you ever ran a marathon? I have not me neither no

2454
03:10:22.68 --> 03:10:28.76
I'm not my granddad. I'm like their aunt did yeah for sure. Oh climb to what do you say five four teenagers this

2455
03:10:29.40 --> 03:10:34.84
Past summer what does that mean sixty fourteen thousand foot peaks? Oh, that's tall. Oh

2456
03:10:35.08 --> 03:10:38.60
That's the slang that's how you say it for 14 years. You say the gear

2457
03:10:39.24 --> 03:10:44.76
Let me send yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you know, I've never climbed five or any

2458
03:10:44.76 --> 03:10:51.48
Four teenagers for that matter and I haven't broken my back. So what I'm saying is the point there is there that's a that's saying a lot

2459
03:10:52.92 --> 03:10:55.40
Or it's putting things into perspective

2460
03:10:55.56 --> 03:11:00.92
Same saying we're like you can break your back and break your femur compound fracture by the way

2461
03:11:01.88 --> 03:11:08.12
Then dragged then captive with no real medical attention for eleven days and

2462
03:11:08.12 --> 03:11:15.32
Then after that go still lift still climb five four teenagers still run marathons

2463
03:11:17.08 --> 03:11:23.56
It's kind of like okay now it kind of puts into perspective this might be a choice if we're not kind of on the path you know

2464
03:11:25.80 --> 03:11:29.64
So yeah, we got to stand that path we want to choose the right path choose the right path

2465
03:11:29.64 --> 03:11:33.32
Yes, sir. What do you got how how can you help us choose the right path? We want to be strong

2466
03:11:33.32 --> 03:11:37.96
One be capable he made a good point. He was like the thing about your back is strength is very important

2467
03:11:37.96 --> 03:11:43.32
Yeah, right and that that's true like if you have a strong back it like effects everything just like if you

2468
03:11:43.64 --> 03:11:46.36
Leave talks about that like life has a bad back if he deadlifts

2469
03:11:47.40 --> 03:11:52.76
Yeah, he gets better if he doesn't it gets hurt yeah, and even that is a crazy weird little dichotomy too

2470
03:11:52.76 --> 03:11:55.56
Right because if you have a bad back and you start dead lifting all crazy heavy

2471
03:11:56.28 --> 03:11:58.28
That's that's that's bad. You gotta be squared away

2472
03:11:59.40 --> 03:12:01.40
I can't be an ego lifter

2473
03:12:01.40 --> 03:12:06.36
That's sure that's someone was just learned reason yeah, that's that can be dating us too for sure

2474
03:12:06.92 --> 03:12:11.16
And the last one be capable right because how much you're lifting or not lifting one be capable

2475
03:12:11.16 --> 03:12:16.44
You can be capable of lifting heavy things kind of got exercise that can stop and be capable of running marathons or

2476
03:12:16.68 --> 03:12:18.68
14ers or whatever the case maybe

2477
03:12:19.16 --> 03:12:24.52
Get exercise that can stuff but when you exercise yes, it is rough. He can be rough

2478
03:12:24.52 --> 03:12:26.84
So we might need supplementation, but don't worry

2479
03:12:26.84 --> 03:12:33.08
Jocquette supplementation jocquette. Man's just landed. I'm just a little danger. I'm just staying in the facts

2480
03:12:33.08 --> 03:12:38.68
I'm just saying you just press record, but I'm gonna say thanks, Jocco. Thank you. That was freaking poetic

2481
03:12:38.68 --> 03:12:42.92
I can't take credit continuity of that whole just the way it landed in there, you know

2482
03:12:43.64 --> 03:12:48.04
Well, thanks thus storm whatever you're putting it down right target every time yes, sir

2483
03:12:48.84 --> 03:12:51.16
But I can't take credit. I'm just staying in the facts. Okay

2484
03:12:51.16 --> 03:12:59.48
Right, what do we got for supplements so for well let's start with the energy drinks. Okay, so not typical energy drinks not traditional energy drinks not

2485
03:13:00.04 --> 03:13:02.04
Old old

2486
03:13:02.04 --> 03:13:04.04
Unreliable poisonous

2487
03:13:04.28 --> 03:13:06.84
And what they used to give you and you had a headache back in the day?

2488
03:13:07.48 --> 03:13:09.48
More a fiend or cocaine

2489
03:13:09.48 --> 03:13:14.36
Yeah, cocaine right so yeah, yeah, like cocaine. Yeah, maybe cocaine was for the answer cocaine was for that

2490
03:13:14.36 --> 03:13:18.28
More a fiend was this morphing was for that. That's what they do like I I don't feel great today

2491
03:13:18.28 --> 03:13:22.20
Cool, but you want more fiend right on that's that was a normal thing

2492
03:13:22.76 --> 03:13:27.64
All by the way and smoke these these things over here suck on this smoke into your lungs because I know how you do

2493
03:13:28.04 --> 03:13:32.36
They were legitimately doing that. We're gonna think even you like vodka or something too for salt

2494
03:13:32.36 --> 03:13:35.80
So they would tell pregnant women hey, you know, you need to relax go have a couple

2495
03:13:35.80 --> 03:13:41.32
They did that my mom yeah my mom told me she was drinking gin and tonics like a bug a boss, you know

2496
03:13:41.32 --> 03:13:43.88
When you was pregnant with me, which explains a lot

2497
03:13:43.88 --> 03:13:48.36
Explain to little yeah, you got him saying yeah, but when I do that anymore

2498
03:13:49.08 --> 03:13:54.84
Right what I but what I'm saying is you wouldn't have known back in the jury that when the doctor

2499
03:13:55.72 --> 03:13:57.40
prescribed you

2500
03:13:57.40 --> 03:13:58.60
cocaine

2501
03:13:58.60 --> 03:14:03.72
Yeah for your headache you wouldn't be suspect until you were freaking crackhead

2502
03:14:05.32 --> 03:14:08.44
Right so it's a thing with right now with the

2503
03:14:08.44 --> 03:14:14.20
Traditional poisonous energy drinks that a lot of people don't even know that their poisonous yet. Yeah, they're sitting there drinking them

2504
03:14:14.20 --> 03:14:18.52
They think they're actually good to go they think that that's just a little bit of cocaine and they're gonna be fine

2505
03:14:18.52 --> 03:14:23.000
It's not it's a lot of bit of cocaine and it's addictive and it's killing you

2506
03:14:23.56 --> 03:14:26.92
So we're not down with that what we are down with this monk fruit

2507
03:14:27.24 --> 03:14:31.24
Well, we are down with this pasteurization what we are down with is

2508
03:14:31.64 --> 03:14:37.48
95 milligrams of clean caffeine that's what we're down with we actually made something that's healthy for you

2509
03:14:37.48 --> 03:14:44.20
Yeah, my kids drink it my own children drink it. Yeah, so if you want some

2510
03:14:44.84 --> 03:14:48.36
We get some discipline go. That's a new paradigm of energy drinks

2511
03:14:49.000 --> 03:14:52.36
Well, you know stuff that's good for you. Good for your brain too. There's some new tropics in there

2512
03:14:52.60 --> 03:14:57.96
You got to keep that in mind when you're drinking this stuff. Maybe that's where you get your little landings from you get the whole story

2513
03:14:58.20 --> 03:15:04.36
You know figured out boom there you go. That's the discipline go kicking in it. It's very possible bringing it on home. Yes, not less

2514
03:15:04.36 --> 03:15:06.36
Yes

2515
03:15:07.000 --> 03:15:09.88
Sometimes when we're lifting running marathons climbing

2516
03:15:10.52 --> 03:15:15.40
14ers five or whatever the case may be sometimes joints get jammed up

2517
03:15:16.04 --> 03:15:17.64
But

2518
03:15:17.64 --> 03:15:23.000
We got some supplements for that as well join work for super-crile oil get on the the the subscription

2519
03:15:23.08 --> 03:15:27.40
Actually to all these things, but especially for these because that's not the that's not the fun one like the monk

2520
03:15:27.40 --> 03:15:29.40
Which I'll get into in a little bit

2521
03:15:29.40 --> 03:15:36.12
It about a 30 40 minutes from now. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Oh, but it's true

2522
03:15:36.60 --> 03:15:39.80
Even me a grown man. I have my routine very effective

2523
03:15:40.44 --> 03:15:44.76
But everyone's a while I'll forget that's the the cruel oil and the joint work for not recently

2524
03:15:45.000 --> 03:15:47.000
But it has happened

2525
03:15:47.000 --> 03:15:48.52
But you have you get on the subscription

2526
03:15:48.52 --> 03:15:52.44
It'll that'll help but nonetheless you want to look after your joints on this thing don't neglect them

2527
03:15:52.44 --> 03:15:55.40
It's easy to neglect if you let it let it happen but don't neglect a

2528
03:15:55.40 --> 03:16:01.32
immunity look out for that to 100% vitamin D3 take that every day. I take it every day

2529
03:16:01.32 --> 03:16:02.92
I take one the morning one at night by the way

2530
03:16:03.48 --> 03:16:07.40
Cold war that's there got your back that's like air support right?

2531
03:16:07.88 --> 03:16:11.72
It's fine overhead it can lay down some some thunder if needed

2532
03:16:11.72 --> 03:16:17.16
So you go on that you get the cold war going and then you're just gonna say something about milk milk all day the milk train

2533
03:16:17.16 --> 03:16:19.16
So I've yet

2534
03:16:19.16 --> 03:16:24.68
To try the banana one. Oh, I have it standing by. Oh, it's good, but tell see you proved. Oh, yeah

2535
03:16:24.68 --> 03:16:28.92
Oh, yeah big time, but now you're getting the full on banana cream scenario. Well

2536
03:16:29.48 --> 03:16:33.56
Creamy banana cream right because that's just said that the frozen bread banana makes it more creamy

2537
03:16:34.12 --> 03:16:36.12
same as what she said yeah

2538
03:16:36.76 --> 03:16:38.76
So yeah, milk protein

2539
03:16:39.56 --> 03:16:42.04
additional protein in the form of a dessert

2540
03:16:43.08 --> 03:16:45.08
That one a little bit harder to forget

2541
03:16:45.40 --> 03:16:49.64
Something because it's kind of your mind a lot more because I think about because sometimes you're getting done with a

2542
03:16:51.24 --> 03:16:53.48
28 ounce Tomahawk steak

2543
03:16:53.48 --> 03:16:58.84
This is about as good as the world gets right you eat a 28 ounce Tomahawk steak by the way

2544
03:16:58.84 --> 03:17:02.20
I got some sitting in my freezer right now they're getting ready to get crushed

2545
03:17:03.56 --> 03:17:09.32
But I will finish a 28 ounce Tomahawk steak. I will be so

2546
03:17:10.12 --> 03:17:12.12
satisfied

2547
03:17:12.12 --> 03:17:13.32
Mentally

2548
03:17:13.32 --> 03:17:15.000
Physically

2549
03:17:15.000 --> 03:17:20.20
Spiritualy spiritually. I guess what I still want a little more kid or a little kid

2550
03:17:20.20 --> 03:17:27.56
And then it makes complete sense. It makes complete sense. So yeah, so like you're gonna be like it's gonna be on your mind way more and

2551
03:17:27.80 --> 03:17:32.84
Underway more circumstances as opposed to like you never like okay, so a lot of times you can be like oh, yeah

2552
03:17:32.84 --> 03:17:36.68
I'm really in the mood for a little more kidder or let's face it big one

2553
03:17:37.80 --> 03:17:43.56
Or triple one whatever the case may be you will you will find yourself in the mood for that from time to time pretty often actually

2554
03:17:43.88 --> 03:17:48.44
Yeah, but you don't really find yourself you know, I'm in the mood for to take some krill oil

2555
03:17:48.44 --> 03:17:54.04
Yeah, it's like it doesn't work even though the benefit to the krill oil is or or very significant

2556
03:17:54.04 --> 03:17:58.28
Same same yeah, I'm just saying keep these things in mind yep get yourself some milk

2557
03:17:58.52 --> 03:18:04.28
That way you can have dessert and feel good about it juggle white tea by the way it's winter time and some places including here

2558
03:18:04.28 --> 03:18:08.44
That means you transition into that warm tea in the morning and a little bit of juggle white tea
