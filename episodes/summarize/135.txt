but I think that that natural tendency to be exposed as as someone who doesn't know something to be exposed as someone who doesn't have all the answers to expose as a leader who doesn't know everything I'm gonna let you in a little secret everybody already knows that everybody knows that you don't know everything and if you try to act like you do it will make it ten times worse than just saying I actually don't know what to do here or I made a mistake here when you make a mistake everybody knows it your subordinates know it your peers know it your boss is know it and the worst thing you can do is to tell them that you didn't that's why being insecure in your leadership capabilities is a downward spiral because the more insecure you are the more you try and manipulate the main thing everything and keep everything under your wraps and do everything your way and that's how it is so when you're insecure as a leader and that's another that's another thing that takes a little bit of a leap of faith that's another like progression that I personally made I personally made and I can't remember when but when I was like you know what it's because and when I pulled it when I started going through hack again about Facebook and I started reading that I realized that you got to change your perspective as a leader it's not just it's not just hey because we simplify it like well if your millennials aren't doing what you want it's your fault that's that's a simplification of it because what you really got to do is you got to shift your mindset a little bit and say like what wait a second how do I take advantage of that's what hack worth was doing hack worth was same wait a second how do I take advantage these guys guess what they're going to question me if I do something wrong they're going to report things that are done correctly they're going to say no if I plan something stupid is that a bad thing let me think about it actually no that's actually not a bad thing so if you've got a millennial that's like hey if I don't like the leadership here I'm leaving the company guess what let's get that person some good leadership you got a millennial that says hey if I don't understand why we're doing what we're doing like your reading reports but you're not there mentally well look combat for me was dropping a bomb in Iraq you know and Afghanistan was a certainly more aggressive experience for me you know it was a lot more regular pace there was certainly some risk involved but you've talked about the first combat experience on this podcast a lot we've talked about just the first combat experience as well I did not really get it until I saw it and actually in some ways you could say I didn't get it till I heard it you know the sounds of combat what it really sounds like to have a bullet go past your head so close to you can actually sort of gauge how close it was to your head and whether it was closer to the guy next to you three feet away closer to you who was the sniper actually looking I've had those thoughts I know you have too so the sights of the sounds of that it's just it's hard to replicate and I've actually been in MBS you've talked about the training that you did for your guys at task in bruising some of the things you did I didn't do a lot of those things you know and I'm going to kind of sell like hey boss you know those guys aren't they're not they're not the best guys you know this is not the best team here's here's a here's a say let's call it a drill or a coaching I'll call it that a coaching when the next time you get into a situation and you write down and you take the excuses and the reasons that you come up with look at them and then figure out how they were how those things were actually your fault and or how you could have prevented them because a lot of times it's like here's here's here's one hey boss we didn't get the mission accomplished because the weather rolled in and we couldn't launch on the mission that's that's the problem now we all know that we don't control the weather so when you we'll tell you write the problem down we failed the mission because we didn't control the weather we we can't control the weather that's why we failed the mission that's my excuse that's a that's a logical reason there's that's that's a that's a legitimate excuse but don't use it what you do is you say what could I have done to have controlled the weather and the exact opposite is true and like when the people and I work for people that I despised and I despised because that how they treated me how they treated other people and it's very evident like don't be like that it doesn't work I'll be in a group of leaders you know we're doing to work with the company I've done this many times where I'll set it up with hey who here has had someone in your life as that would that that was in charge of you that invested in you and took care of you raise your hand and everyone raised their hand and or 99% of the people raise their hand if not 100% of people raise your hand because that's you know usually we're talking to leaders in the company and so the leaders have made progress somehow and they've made progress because someone at some point taught them and took them under their wing and cared about them and you you take that very seriously when you're in a position you're gonna you're gonna be one of the deciding factors in whether that person stays or goes anytime you get to that point where you're in mind like hey the best thing is to get rid of this guy and if you bring him in for this are that final interview that final interaction the guarantee way to seal your fate the guarantee way to ensure what they've already kind of concluded because that's why they're bringing you in in the first place is to not take any responsibility it's not taking any terms that is 100% guarantee now it doesn't mean that you might just not be able to you might not have the technical skills of capability sometimes you're gonna get fired and and sometimes your mistake is so agriest and does so much damage you gotta go you're gonna get fired but even then the the best thing you can do the best thing you can do is to take ownership of all that and be like hey boss I understand I'm sorry or you can go the other route and you can start to throw everybody under the bus it's just a complete nightmare it makes you wonder how any of that is is makes any of it remotely functional like how does that system function at all under that setting under that environment how could anybody at the bottom of that hierarchy be willing to go do any of the things they went and did you know you're talking about you know this thing from from Bella wood they're they literally know most of you're gonna die we're gonna charge across open fields and a machine guns we use that example at echelon front is something that you would never do and that's what they were doing I mean border line just human waves if we do it enough we're gonna get 50 75 yards of terrain out of it we're gonna move the line 400 yards and you actually execute and implement what you said you're going to do guess what you will accomplish the mission that there's a whole part of ownership that pre-empts the problem if you've got someone that knows if I know that I can make an excuse if I know that I can make an excuse think that's what I'm not gonna set things up properly if I don't set things up properly more often or more often than the other way I will fail to execute what I'm supposed to execute if you have an excuse right same same thing with you as an individual human being if you as an individual human being if you got some excuses that you can throw out there that you can say I had no control over that then you know what you say okay I read the the preface out loud to myself and having had read it three four times I'm just hearing it it was like reading it for the first time the the voice that you give that makes it makes the words become real like a like that person wrote the book is saying out loud and that difference there it's not subtle it's huge it's a huge huge thing that that is one of the great things about when people do it when they do it on podcasts and you're putting somebody else's voice in action most of the time reading books by people that are long gone and you're telling stories that nobody would ever hear and even if you read them it misses something it's it's what you're not doing I think like if you know like I see what you're doing I see you're doing there using your little chocolate tricks all this stuff that's not the influential part you're not doing you know it's so funny now because everyone I deal with now every single person that I deal with on any level on any on any depth at all they all know all my little tricks as you call them they all know every every person I'm involved with knows them all yeah we use the analogy a lot we talk about this in our front and like hey it your folks when you're pushing your folks too hard it's like it's like driving a car in the red you you're running this car in the red you're running hard and if you keep them in the red too long that car is gonna break and then just gonna break now you can you can push to the red a little bit you can kind of throttle up it and and do that and I felt that several times in my career and the response to it is it's all the same and one of the best things about responding to those situations is that as a leader you're really busy there's a lot to do you you've got a lot going on a lot of decision you have to make a lot of things you have to be aware of and that's actually one of the best remedies for all that and you know it's probably really tough for someone it really junior in the organization that may feel like it doesn't know what's going on doesn't have a real sense of those things I was never really bored so if you just kind of do the math it's just not a lot of time everything I think about every leadership lesson every when I hear you talk about a book when I read a book when I think all of those things the frame of reference I have the thing I think about is those seven months and had I not had those seven months of and look Ramadi obviously was it was a maddening place it was crazy but if I didn't have that I don't think I would be able to appreciate or understand and without that frame of reference without that understanding of some connection to that it actually makes it difficult and I would have never guessed it if I would have tell you hey I'm going to look back on my 23 year career and all those things I heard you listen to my bio it's always strange here someone read it out the the the the the the most powerful thing in that was seven months in Ramadi that's a thing that outshines all of it because of what you just described because of that feeling so so the sledgehammer for me I mean I will never forget the day on the ever forget June 20th ever the sledgehammer for me was the first day I got there the guy that I was replacing got in a humvee hit an ID he was woony buddy broke both of his legs in a humvee that I was supposed to take from him we were supposed to do the turnover of that humvee and obviously not getting that vehicle because it got blown up but it was a major in the Marine Corps and it was like majors and a major aviator in the Marine Corps got blown up by an ID so I got up to speed very quickly and that place had an ability to get you to be aware of the reality but very fast so I think I got there very fast day one something happened but the anticipation of that getting there that was kind of a sledgehammer for me what about reading reports when you're going in so I we talked about the last time my best friend was in Ramadi Neil and I think the power that is huge and it brought me right back to our last podcast which was you sitting right where you are reading cats letter to Chris and as it like I said like I had never heard it before it was it's a totally different level you know what podcasts was another podcast that sort of it got me was one soldier's war by arcadey and that part in the end of that podcast where it's again that was podcast number 18 it was it was a good solid deployment was there a risk sure there was risky wasn't super high risk I had had a great crew of guys but you know there was there was stress and there was personalities and you start to see that when you read about a guy and you think I kind of know that guy just I just know him a little bit I just know him a little bit yeah just like a draft just like a drafty and when when we see it in in leaders all the time they they present it like can't leave these people this is unsolvable problem it is a problem that the end we're we're going downhill it's supersonic speeds and when you do what you just said and turn it change that perspective and then put it in comparison to the story of the drafties they're almost a little embarrassed but when you read it it's maddening to think about that and you could see that like hack worth he didn't like that he didn't like that at all and that was all that was I think maybe it was you that told me when I had Jim Mucchiamon and or a couple people told me they were like you sounded giddy so then you guys always talking in context of business you know the boss and the support and that's whatever same exact thing with your wife same thing even though it feels like counter intuitive you know you're you you had all this stuff to do that you're doing for her by the way and you didn't take out the trash I don't know I'm not saying that happened to me not saying it didn't happen to me and so that's the first podcast where I said when I got done with it the next time I did a podcast that was heavy like that I knew that I had to get myself somewhere to go I had to give myself some thought about how am I gonna make this how does this become something I like I don't get out of this whole because that's what that's what you're doing and so there's a level of that as well when you hear like when you hear a hardcore history podcast you get a great storytelling oh no I knew all this at birth it's from these giant errors that we've made or giant mistakes where these giant realizations like I've been doing it wrong and everybody has to figure that out and that and that right there that is one of the most gratifying things about what we do now is that this gap that we talked about earlier this little gap between like how do you read something you read something and then how do you get that thing out of it how do you extract that vital piece of information that's in there how do you do that how do you tell look it looks like when you're kidding you don't listen to your parents so it's almost like you're getting worse you know if you do the math like now at level four out of a million you're like there you just like yesterday there was only four moves Yeah, and the language is different and if you just hear the words it sounds like a completely different world and then when you think about what he's saying I know exactly what you can you can feel what he's feeling and it comes through so so clearly and and I've read letters like that. and that's probably why if I look back in my career the thing that's the most powerful experience that I had that sort of outshines everything by so much is is that time in Rammadi because I was exposed to things that I never saw as a pilot and never would have seen had I not been on that deployment you know what I was thinking so one of the things I remember probably I don't know if it was 10 or 15 podcasts deep into into this podcast I remember saying during one of the podcasts and I've said it a few times along the way I remember saying that these people that I'm talking about in these books they're not characters two emphasize what you said that eyes opening that's a literal thing like they're not of metaphor you look at them and when you finally get it to click when you when their eyes actually open up and they sit up straight and they kind of sit back a little bit and there is a moment a physical moment are you recognize that they got it and when you see that and you can actually sit in an audience when you when you when you're talking to a group like maybe multiple leaders on the team and you're around a conference table and you're interacting and you bring up a particular example that they're dealing with you lay out the different possible scenarios and the one that is obviously the right one and they go yeah you said something that that jumped out of me a little bit you were you were just talking about you know is is is culture different it is something different so let me just say this a little bit because you know I've even thought a little bit about why do I see things differently than I used to what why have I evolved in a certain way so did I spent 23 years in the Marine Corps 23 years as a US Marine and a whole bunch of years just wanting to be a Marine I was in Ramadi for seven months but he's like going through the motions almost like like kind of kind of understanding you know
