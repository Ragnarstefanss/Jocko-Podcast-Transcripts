00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.84
This is Jocco podcast number 10 with echo Charles and me, Jocco Willink.

2
00:00:11.84 --> 00:00:16.12
Assault into hell.

3
00:00:16.12 --> 00:00:20.96
We waited a seeming eternity for the signal to start towards the beach.

4
00:00:20.96 --> 00:00:24.24
This suspense was almost more than I could bear.

5
00:00:24.24 --> 00:00:29.76
Waiting is a major part of war, but I never experienced any more supremely agonizing suspense

6
00:00:29.76 --> 00:00:35.44
in the extruciating torture of those moments before we received the signal to begin the assault

7
00:00:35.44 --> 00:00:37.60
on Pelaloo.

8
00:00:37.60 --> 00:00:42.68
I broke out and a cold sweat as the tension mounted with the intensity of the bombardment.

9
00:00:42.68 --> 00:00:45.32
My stomach was tied in knots.

10
00:00:45.32 --> 00:00:50.44
I had a lump in my throat and swallowed only with great difficulty.

11
00:00:50.44 --> 00:00:55.84
My knees nearly buckled, so I clung weakly to the side of the tractor.

12
00:00:55.84 --> 00:01:00.48
I felt nauseated and feared that my bladder would surely empty itself and reveal me to be

13
00:01:00.48 --> 00:01:03.20
the coward I was.

14
00:01:03.20 --> 00:01:07.36
But the men around me looked just about the same way I felt.

15
00:01:07.36 --> 00:01:12.72
Finally, with a sense of fatalistic relief, mixed with a flash of anger at the navy officer

16
00:01:12.72 --> 00:01:15.04
who was our wave commander.

17
00:01:15.04 --> 00:01:18.08
I saw him wave his flag toward the beach.

18
00:01:18.08 --> 00:01:21.04
Our driver revved the engine.

19
00:01:21.04 --> 00:01:23.96
The treads churned up the water and we started in.

20
00:01:23.96 --> 00:01:26.92
The second wave is sure.

21
00:01:26.92 --> 00:01:31.20
We moved ahead, watching the frightful spectacle.

22
00:01:31.20 --> 00:01:34.52
Huge guisers of water rose around the amtrax.

23
00:01:34.52 --> 00:01:37.64
A head of us, as they approached the reef.

24
00:01:37.64 --> 00:01:42.92
The beach was now marked along its length by a continuous sheet of flame backed by a thick

25
00:01:42.92 --> 00:01:45.48
wall of smoke.

26
00:01:45.48 --> 00:01:51.000
It seemed as though a huge volcano had erupted from the sea and rather than heading for an island,

27
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.04
we were being drawn into the vortex of a flaming abyss.

28
00:01:55.04 --> 00:02:00.000
For many, it was to be oblivion.

29
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.88
Suddenly a large shell exploded with a terrific concussion and a huge guiser rose up right

30
00:02:05.88 --> 00:02:07.76
next to our front.

31
00:02:07.76 --> 00:02:09.20
It barely missed us.

32
00:02:09.20 --> 00:02:10.56
The engine stalled.

33
00:02:10.56 --> 00:02:14.32
The front of the tractor lurched to the left and bumped hard against the rear of another

34
00:02:14.32 --> 00:02:17.40
ramp track that was either stalled or hit.

35
00:02:17.40 --> 00:02:20.40
I never knew which.

36
00:02:20.40 --> 00:02:25.44
We sat, stalled, floating in the water for some terrifying moments.

37
00:02:25.44 --> 00:02:28.40
We were sitting ducks for the enemy gunners.

38
00:02:28.40 --> 00:02:30.96
I look forward through the hatch behind the driver.

39
00:02:30.96 --> 00:02:33.52
He was wrestling frantically with the control levers.

40
00:02:33.52 --> 00:02:37.40
Japanese shells were screaming into the air and exploding all around us.

41
00:02:37.40 --> 00:02:41.96
Sergeant Johnny Marmet leaned toward the driver and yelled something.

42
00:02:41.96 --> 00:02:46.40
Whatever it was, it seemed to calm the driver because he got the engine started.

43
00:02:46.40 --> 00:02:51.40
We moved forward again amid the guisers of exploding shells.

44
00:02:51.40 --> 00:02:54.88
Our bombardment began to lift off the beach and move inland.

45
00:02:54.88 --> 00:02:58.36
Our dive bombers also moved inland with their strafing and bombing.

46
00:02:58.36 --> 00:03:03.20
The Japanese increased their volume of fire against the waves of amtrax.

47
00:03:03.20 --> 00:03:07.52
Above the den, I could hear the ominous sound of shell fragments humming and growling

48
00:03:07.52 --> 00:03:09.16
through the air.

49
00:03:09.16 --> 00:03:12.12
Stand by someone yelled.

50
00:03:12.12 --> 00:03:18.44
Hit the beach, yelled an NCO moments before the machine lurched to a stop.

51
00:03:18.44 --> 00:03:20.84
The men piled over the sides as fast as they could.

52
00:03:20.84 --> 00:03:25.64
I followed Snaffu, climbed up and planted both feet firmly on the left side, so as to

53
00:03:25.64 --> 00:03:28.28
leap as far away from it as possible.

54
00:03:28.28 --> 00:03:32.12
At that instant, a burst of machine gun fire with white hot tracer snapped through the

55
00:03:32.12 --> 00:03:35.72
air at eye level, almost grazing my face.

56
00:03:35.72 --> 00:03:41.76
I pulled back like a turtle, lost my balance and fell awkwardly forward down under the sand.

57
00:03:41.76 --> 00:03:46.92
In a tangle of ammo bag, pack, helmet, carbean, gas mask, cartridge belt, and flopping

58
00:03:46.92 --> 00:03:48.56
canteens.

59
00:03:48.56 --> 00:03:53.04
Get off the beach, get off the beach, race through my mind.

60
00:03:53.04 --> 00:03:58.32
Shells crashed all around, fragments torn, word, slapping on the sand and splashing

61
00:03:58.32 --> 00:04:01.16
into the water a few yards behind us.

62
00:04:01.16 --> 00:04:05.40
The Japanese were recovering from the shock of our pre-landing bombardment.

63
00:04:05.40 --> 00:04:11.52
Their machine gun and rifle fire got thicker, snapping viciously overhead in an increasing

64
00:04:11.52 --> 00:04:13.52
volume.

65
00:04:13.52 --> 00:04:18.40
Up and down the beach and out on the reef, a number of amtrax were burning.

66
00:04:18.40 --> 00:04:23.20
Japanese machine gun burst made long splashes on the water, as they'll fling it with

67
00:04:23.20 --> 00:04:25.32
some giant whip.

68
00:04:25.32 --> 00:04:30.000
The guisers belched up relentlessly where the mortar and artillery shells hit.

69
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:38.44
I caught a fleeting glimpse of a group of marines, leaving a smoking amtrak on the reef.

70
00:04:38.44 --> 00:04:43.80
Some fell as bullets and fragments splashed among them.

71
00:04:43.80 --> 00:04:50.16
Their buddies tried to help them as they struggled in knee deep water.

72
00:04:50.16 --> 00:04:52.44
I shuddered and choked.

73
00:04:52.44 --> 00:04:57.48
A wild desperate feeling of anger, frustration and pity gripped me.

74
00:04:57.48 --> 00:05:02.28
It was an emotion that would always torture my mind when I saw men trapped and was unable

75
00:05:02.28 --> 00:05:05.84
to do anything but watch as they were hit.

76
00:05:05.84 --> 00:05:11.84
My own plate forgotten momentarily, I felt sick into the depths of my soul.

77
00:05:11.84 --> 00:05:16.000
I asked God, why, why, why?

78
00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.84
I turned my face away and wished that I were imagining it all.

79
00:05:20.84 --> 00:05:24.56
I tasted the bitterest essence of war.

80
00:05:24.56 --> 00:05:33.72
The sight of helpless comrades being slaughtered and it filled me with disgust.

81
00:05:33.72 --> 00:05:43.08
That right there is from a book, an absolutely incredible book called, with the Old

82
00:05:43.08 --> 00:05:48.12
Breed by Eugene Sledge.

83
00:05:48.12 --> 00:06:00.28
Eugene Sledge was a Marine, who is a Marine in World War II and he ended up being a university

84
00:06:00.28 --> 00:06:03.48
professor and an author when he got done.

85
00:06:03.48 --> 00:06:05.04
He wrote this book.

86
00:06:05.04 --> 00:06:09.44
I read this book for the first time when I was on deployment to Iraq.

87
00:06:09.44 --> 00:06:12.68
My first deployment to Iraq.

88
00:06:12.68 --> 00:06:24.08
And it definitely kept me in check because it made me always remember that what we were

89
00:06:24.08 --> 00:06:37.04
experiencing, this war that we were in was something that men had always experienced and

90
00:06:37.04 --> 00:06:45.80
actually they have experienced much, much worse than I ever experienced.

91
00:06:45.80 --> 00:06:55.76
This book was later used to make the documentary, a PBS documentary called The War.

92
00:06:55.76 --> 00:07:02.28
And in 2000, I think it came out in 2010 was the HBO mini-series called The Pacific, which

93
00:07:02.28 --> 00:07:09.40
is an absolutely epic series.

94
00:07:09.40 --> 00:07:16.84
If you haven't watched The Pacific, it's phenomenal, get it and watch it.

95
00:07:16.84 --> 00:07:18.76
It's completely realistic.

96
00:07:18.76 --> 00:07:24.20
One of the things that struck me when I watched it for the first time was he talks about

97
00:07:24.20 --> 00:07:31.000
the waiting and the very first episode of The Pacific, you're waiting for something

98
00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.40
happened, they're showing the guy's prep and they actually land and you're waiting and

99
00:07:35.40 --> 00:07:38.000
waiting for something to happen.

100
00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.08
And it doesn't.

101
00:07:40.08 --> 00:07:43.60
It has this feeling.

102
00:07:43.60 --> 00:07:48.80
And I remember that feeling, especially being in Ramadi, when you'd be out in the streets

103
00:07:48.80 --> 00:07:50.88
and no shooting it started yet.

104
00:07:50.88 --> 00:07:53.80
And I would be, you know, everyone would have this feeling.

105
00:07:53.80 --> 00:07:57.32
You're waiting for it to start and every step you're waiting for it to start.

106
00:07:57.32 --> 00:08:07.96
So it does a very, it doesn't incredible job of portraying that and giving you that feeling.

107
00:08:07.96 --> 00:08:14.96
Now, what's important to remember about Eugene Sledge and that's another great thing about

108
00:08:14.96 --> 00:08:22.20
the Pacific is that they do interviews with these guys.

109
00:08:22.20 --> 00:08:26.92
They do interviews with them and you can see when you watch this, you will see that Eugene

110
00:08:26.92 --> 00:08:27.92
Sledge.

111
00:08:27.92 --> 00:08:33.72
And as I thought about how I would describe Eugene Sledge, he's, yes, he's a marine and

112
00:08:33.72 --> 00:08:38.72
you know, you get whatever ideas you get in your mind of what a marine is, you know,

113
00:08:38.72 --> 00:08:43.28
a tough guy filled with bravado.

114
00:08:43.28 --> 00:08:50.08
Eugene Sledge just will destroy that image because Eugene Sledge and if I think of the

115
00:08:50.08 --> 00:08:59.96
way I would describe him, it would be to say simply, he's a good man.

116
00:08:59.96 --> 00:09:05.56
And you can tell when he talks that he's an upright man and that he's a moral man and

117
00:09:05.56 --> 00:09:07.76
he's a gentle and a kind person.

118
00:09:07.76 --> 00:09:14.64
I mean, it is his gentleness and his kindness oozes out of him and he seems like and I don't

119
00:09:14.64 --> 00:09:17.28
use this word very often.

120
00:09:17.28 --> 00:09:20.20
But I will use it because this is how I would describe.

121
00:09:20.20 --> 00:09:24.60
He seems like a lovely human being.

122
00:09:24.60 --> 00:09:30.80
I mean, he just seems like a lovely person.

123
00:09:30.80 --> 00:09:41.40
And so as we go into this book, remember that this guy who went through this was just

124
00:09:41.40 --> 00:09:54.56
an absolutely incredibly good human and also an incredible warrior.

125
00:09:54.56 --> 00:10:01.20
And now the last podcast we talked about patent and war as I knew it and that is a

126
00:10:01.20 --> 00:10:02.48
genuals of view.

127
00:10:02.48 --> 00:10:08.84
And if you remember when we talked about when we went to Sri Lanka, that was that guy

128
00:10:08.84 --> 00:10:16.66
described the foot soldiers view as being a worms view because you're so in the front

129
00:10:16.66 --> 00:10:18.80
line that it's like a worm and that's what this is.

130
00:10:18.80 --> 00:10:19.96
This is a soldiers book.

131
00:10:19.96 --> 00:10:21.32
This is a troopers book.

132
00:10:21.32 --> 00:10:25.08
This is the absolute front lines.

133
00:10:25.08 --> 00:10:37.24
And it is a book that really unveils a lot about will and survival and the psychological

134
00:10:37.24 --> 00:10:48.28
nature of war and what it does to people and what people are capable of doing.

135
00:10:48.28 --> 00:10:54.40
And also I think it makes it very clear why we fight against evil.

136
00:10:54.40 --> 00:11:01.44
And I think that it's something that makes me think always about where we are in the

137
00:11:01.44 --> 00:11:10.16
world in a war against evil.

138
00:11:10.16 --> 00:11:12.72
So going back to the book.

139
00:11:12.72 --> 00:11:15.16
We started to move inland.

140
00:11:15.16 --> 00:11:19.88
We had gone only a few yards when an enemy machine gun opened up from a scrub thick

141
00:11:19.88 --> 00:11:22.04
it to our right.

142
00:11:22.04 --> 00:11:26.44
Japanese 81 mm and 90 mm mortars then opened up on us.

143
00:11:26.44 --> 00:11:27.44
Everyone hit the deck.

144
00:11:27.44 --> 00:11:30.72
I dove into a shallow crater.

145
00:11:30.72 --> 00:11:33.52
The company was completely pinned down.

146
00:11:33.52 --> 00:11:35.48
All movements ceased.

147
00:11:35.48 --> 00:11:39.84
The shells fell faster until I couldn't make out individual explosions.

148
00:11:39.84 --> 00:11:47.36
This continuous crashing rumbles with an occasional ripping sound of shrapnel tearing low

149
00:11:47.36 --> 00:11:51.20
through the air overhead amongst the roar.

150
00:11:51.20 --> 00:11:53.52
The air was murky with smoke and dust.

151
00:11:53.52 --> 00:11:57.72
Every muscle in my body was as tight as a piano wire.

152
00:11:57.72 --> 00:12:03.04
I shuttered and shook as though I were having a mild convulsion.

153
00:12:03.04 --> 00:12:04.56
Sweat flowed profusely.

154
00:12:04.56 --> 00:12:10.80
I prayed, clenched my teeth, squeezed my carbine stock and cursed the Japanese.

155
00:12:10.80 --> 00:12:16.52
Our lieutenant, a cape, a clousster, veteran who was nearby seemed to be in about the same

156
00:12:16.52 --> 00:12:18.24
shape.

157
00:12:18.24 --> 00:12:23.24
From the meager protection of my shallow crater, I pitted him or anyone out on that flat

158
00:12:23.24 --> 00:12:25.56
coral.

159
00:12:25.56 --> 00:12:29.04
The heavy mortar barrage went on without slacking.

160
00:12:29.04 --> 00:12:30.64
I thought it would never stop.

161
00:12:30.64 --> 00:12:36.04
I was terrified by the big shells arching down all around us.

162
00:12:36.04 --> 00:12:40.56
One was bound to fall directly into my hole, I thought.

163
00:12:40.56 --> 00:12:45.80
If any orders were passed along or if anyone yelled for a corpsman I never heard it in

164
00:12:45.80 --> 00:12:47.20
all the noise.

165
00:12:47.20 --> 00:12:53.32
It was as though I were out there on the battlefield all by myself, utterly forlorn and helpless

166
00:12:53.32 --> 00:12:57.08
in a tempest of violent explosions.

167
00:12:57.08 --> 00:13:03.64
All any man could do was sweat it out and pray for survival.

168
00:13:03.64 --> 00:13:08.92
It would have been sure suicide to stand up in that firestorm.

169
00:13:08.92 --> 00:13:14.000
Under my first barrage, the fast moving events of hitting the beach, I learned a new sensation,

170
00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.64
utter and absolute helplessness.

171
00:13:17.64 --> 00:13:21.52
The shelling lifted in about a half an hour, although it seemed to me to have crashed on

172
00:13:21.52 --> 00:13:22.96
for hours.

173
00:13:22.96 --> 00:13:26.32
Time had no meaning.

174
00:13:26.32 --> 00:13:29.20
This was particularly true when under heavy shelling.

175
00:13:29.20 --> 00:13:32.40
I could never judge how long it lasted.

176
00:13:32.40 --> 00:13:38.16
Orders then came to move up, move out and I got up, covered by a layer of coral dust.

177
00:13:38.16 --> 00:13:48.000
I felt like jelly and couldn't believe any of us had survived that barrage.

178
00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:58.44
So that feeling of helplessness and that is one of the worst things for humans,

179
00:13:58.44 --> 00:14:05.68
it's one of the worst human emotions, helplessness.

180
00:14:05.68 --> 00:14:17.48
I have experienced just a minor amount of shelling, of being murdered.

181
00:14:17.48 --> 00:14:24.32
It is definitely, I was in Iraq and my first deployment and we were on a fire base and

182
00:14:24.32 --> 00:14:31.60
we were trying to help with some sniper overwatch because this place had been being attacked.

183
00:14:31.60 --> 00:14:38.80
This was early in my first deployment, my first time going to war.

184
00:14:38.80 --> 00:14:41.60
We're thinking, hey, these guys are getting murdered.

185
00:14:41.60 --> 00:14:47.16
Cool, we'll go out there and kill these people out of morgue room and we'll take care.

186
00:14:47.16 --> 00:14:56.32
So we went out to this base on the outskirts of Baghdad and sure enough we started getting

187
00:14:56.32 --> 00:15:04.04
murdered and the insurgents that were firing the mortars knew exactly what they were doing.

188
00:15:04.04 --> 00:15:12.60
It was horrible because it was in the city and so the mortars were being shot at us

189
00:15:12.60 --> 00:15:22.12
from three or 400 meters away but they were from behind buildings and we could actually

190
00:15:22.12 --> 00:15:25.12
we could actually hear the mortars being launched.

191
00:15:25.12 --> 00:15:32.84
So you would hear the cring, cring, cring, you'd hear the noise and you could actually see

192
00:15:32.84 --> 00:15:35.40
the fire trail of the launch.

193
00:15:35.40 --> 00:15:36.40
So you knew.

194
00:15:36.40 --> 00:15:44.12
So there you are and you're sitting there and you're just waiting to get blown up and

195
00:15:44.12 --> 00:15:48.20
it was interesting because if you have overhead cover which means if you have some kind

196
00:15:48.20 --> 00:15:51.24
of a strong roof over your head, if you're inside of a building, a strong building that's

197
00:15:51.24 --> 00:15:56.08
made a concrete, it doesn't have to be a bunker or anything for smaller mortars.

198
00:15:56.08 --> 00:16:00.12
You're basically safe, you know, you're fine.

199
00:16:00.12 --> 00:16:03.16
And we didn't really understand that yet.

200
00:16:03.16 --> 00:16:09.48
So we had guys myself included that were exposed, that were outside that were on rooftops.

201
00:16:09.48 --> 00:16:18.76
And this is again, I want to emphasize this is nothing, this is nothing compared to what

202
00:16:18.76 --> 00:16:20.04
Eugene Slider just talking about.

203
00:16:20.04 --> 00:16:24.88
The only reason I'm bringing up is because I did experience it and my point is that even

204
00:16:24.88 --> 00:16:32.84
through one night where we took maybe, I don't know, maybe 10 mortar rounds in a night.

205
00:16:32.84 --> 00:16:40.60
It actually affected the guys a little bit one night one night and you could see it actually

206
00:16:40.60 --> 00:16:44.04
when we got back to our compound.

207
00:16:44.04 --> 00:16:49.000
We had a door on our tactical operation center that was an old piece of plywood and it

208
00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.32
somebody mounted a spring on there to keep it shut because it was hot and it was air conditioning

209
00:16:52.32 --> 00:16:56.04
in there and it was a strong spring.

210
00:16:56.04 --> 00:16:59.60
And so when you walked out and you let that go, it would slap and it would make a very

211
00:16:59.60 --> 00:17:00.88
loud bang.

212
00:17:00.88 --> 00:17:08.96
And I literally after one measly night of getting mortar, I watched guys shutter and at

213
00:17:08.96 --> 00:17:12.96
the slap of that noise.

214
00:17:12.96 --> 00:17:20.48
And so to imagine what it was like for these guys for, you know, half an hour of continuous

215
00:17:20.48 --> 00:17:27.08
shelling is it's just it's unbelievable and I'll tell you something else.

216
00:17:27.08 --> 00:17:34.92
If you go back further than that and you go to World War I where those soldiers who are

217
00:17:34.92 --> 00:17:42.68
in the trenches and they got bombarded for months and if you want to know what that does

218
00:17:42.68 --> 00:17:51.24
to a human go on to YouTube and Google World War I or go on to YouTube and search World

219
00:17:51.24 --> 00:18:00.04
War I shell shock and it is horrendous to see the psychological damage that it did to these

220
00:18:00.04 --> 00:18:10.28
guys and the worst part of it was that today we understand that we understand what it does

221
00:18:10.28 --> 00:18:19.76
to people psychologically and we understand that it's it's it's a psychological damage and

222
00:18:19.76 --> 00:18:30.92
in World War I they didn't know that so these guys that broke they were cowards they were

223
00:18:30.92 --> 00:18:40.000
called cowards and to think about that is sickening to me knowing that my guys after like

224
00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:47.000
I said a miniscule amount of receiving mortar and artillery fires, mortar fire but it's

225
00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:53.72
the same thing it's indirect fire that to know that that already had a little bit of effect

226
00:18:53.72 --> 00:19:03.80
to imagine what that did over time was was crazy and I was I got I got two moments in

227
00:19:03.80 --> 00:19:12.04
time that I remember that that I had the feeling of helplessness we were on I was on the

228
00:19:12.04 --> 00:19:16.92
rooftop and again this was in Baghdad and we had gone to the space to set up some sniper

229
00:19:16.92 --> 00:19:23.80
positions and help them eliminate their problem boy were we wrong so this rooftop was

230
00:19:23.80 --> 00:19:33.16
kind of divided up by concrete walls and to get to this to the furthest part away on the

231
00:19:33.16 --> 00:19:39.16
roof you had to go jump a bunch of these walls and you know you were traveling probably I

232
00:19:39.16 --> 00:19:44.76
don't know 50 meters across this rooftop to get to one of the corners and so I had you know

233
00:19:44.76 --> 00:19:48.44
I was checking the positions of all the guys and walking from position to position to see

234
00:19:48.44 --> 00:19:52.04
where they are and see what their field of fire was and making adjustments if needed

235
00:19:52.92 --> 00:20:01.000
checking with them etc so I get up to this I climb out get on the roof climb up this climb up

236
00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:06.76
this stairs to the roof jump a bunch of these you know little four foot walls just

237
00:20:07.80 --> 00:20:11.96
kind of get no over them takes two or three minutes to get and I finally get to this position

238
00:20:11.96 --> 00:20:17.24
where there's one of the one of the gunners has sit in there and as I get there I

239
00:20:17.24 --> 00:20:21.16
hear how's it going and what are you seeing we're having a little discussion and all of a sudden

240
00:20:21.16 --> 00:20:30.36
we hear the mortar launch shung shung shung and one of the other guys in the cartoon gets on the

241
00:20:30.36 --> 00:20:37.24
radio and he says he says that's three boys count them out meaning okay there's going to be three

242
00:20:37.24 --> 00:20:45.88
booms and again we have no overhead cover because I'm on the roof and I look at I look at the

243
00:20:45.88 --> 00:20:51.48
guy I'm with and he says you think we can make it back inside because you have time you know

244
00:20:51.48 --> 00:20:56.92
the mortar rounds going way up in the air he says do you think we can make it back inside and I said

245
00:20:56.92 --> 00:21:07.000
nope then he says what should we do and I said hope it doesn't land in our quadrant

246
00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:11.32
meaning this little area that we actually landed there we'd be dead but that's the feeling of

247
00:21:11.32 --> 00:21:17.80
helping us that that you have and luckily that didn't land in our quadrant I wasn't another situation

248
00:21:17.80 --> 00:21:24.84
this was now on the on the bagged at international airport where our base was and there was an attack

249
00:21:24.84 --> 00:21:30.12
on on one of the gates and we went there as a quick reaction force and we get out there

250
00:21:31.24 --> 00:21:36.12
and as the attacks happening and we're kind of showing up to see what we can do to help out all

251
00:21:36.12 --> 00:21:43.16
the sudden mortar start coming in and again I get down behind just a normal like a jersey barrier

252
00:21:43.16 --> 00:21:49.48
a concrete jersey barrier and it but we're in a pretty open area other than this jersey barrier

253
00:21:50.28 --> 00:21:57.56
and again I'm I'm hunkered down with one other seal and he looks at me and he goes what should we do

254
00:21:59.56 --> 00:22:04.84
and I go there's nothing we can do but sit here and suck it up and and that's really all you

255
00:22:04.84 --> 00:22:11.56
can do and and it's easy to look back and be like that that was funny you know but but that was

256
00:22:11.56 --> 00:22:19.08
that was a three minutes of mortar bombardment right and and so just to imagine the psychological

257
00:22:19.08 --> 00:22:29.000
trauma that these guys experienced it was it was just it's horrible to imagine and and the key

258
00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:35.64
point of all this I think is to to think about as as it pertains to people as it pertains to individuals

259
00:22:35.64 --> 00:22:44.76
as it pertains to us now to people in the civilian world what causes this intense anxiety and fear

260
00:22:44.76 --> 00:22:50.76
is the complete lack of control that's what causes it see what you're going to fire fighter you're

261
00:22:50.76 --> 00:22:54.52
getting shot at it's coming from somewhere and you can hide from it and you can get down and you can

262
00:22:54.52 --> 00:23:02.36
maneuver on it when it's when it's not that when it's just random death that you cannot control

263
00:23:03.48 --> 00:23:10.76
it's it's psychologically much much harder to deal with and thank god we didn't have to deal with it

264
00:23:10.76 --> 00:23:17.64
very often now again when we were in the body the guys that were over with the first the 506 on

265
00:23:17.64 --> 00:23:22.44
camp caragador those guys were getting more than all the time I mean they were they were feeling it

266
00:23:22.44 --> 00:23:28.12
you know again not as bad not world war one style but you know they were getting murdered every

267
00:23:28.12 --> 00:23:36.44
day there was mortars hitting the buildings so that that just randomness is what makes things so

268
00:23:36.44 --> 00:23:42.76
difficult those mortars when you hear that first ignition of them how long does it take to

269
00:23:42.76 --> 00:23:46.52
it depends on how far away they were but you know in this case it was probably like a minute

270
00:23:46.52 --> 00:23:50.60
maybe maybe a little less than that I'd have to sit here and think about it but it was like a minute

271
00:23:50.60 --> 00:23:54.60
maybe 30 seconds it might have been it might have been long it might have been shorter than that but it

272
00:23:54.60 --> 00:23:58.60
seemed like a lot because you're sitting there waiting for it to hit you and that was another

273
00:23:58.60 --> 00:24:06.92
I on the one that was in Baghdad I was sitting there in a home v and we had this we had weapons on

274
00:24:06.92 --> 00:24:12.04
the home v that could reach across the river so we were by a river and we were looking we could see

275
00:24:12.04 --> 00:24:18.44
some activity over across the river and so as we sat there are gunner I said hey can you see this

276
00:24:18.44 --> 00:24:21.96
and he's like yeah I can I can kind of see it and I go do you have a shot and he goes no

277
00:24:21.96 --> 00:24:28.28
because we were behind a behind a it bunk some kind of wall I go do you have a shot and he goes no I

278
00:24:28.28 --> 00:24:33.08
can't I don't have a shot yet so I said hey pull the home v forward so I told the driver we pull the

279
00:24:33.08 --> 00:24:42.68
home v forward like I don't know 30 feet maybe 35 feet and a minute later a mortar hit exactly

280
00:24:42.68 --> 00:24:48.36
where that one was luckily was only a 60 millimeter which is a tiny little tiny little mortar

281
00:24:48.36 --> 00:24:54.68
and no one even got fracked but I mean you know we were we were 30 seconds away or a minute away

282
00:24:54.68 --> 00:25:05.000
from just taking a mortar round right in the home v that we were all in so it's it's it's again I don't

283
00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:12.28
want to put anything that I experienced on any level with what these guys experienced the only

284
00:25:12.28 --> 00:25:19.24
reason I'm saying is to give a miniscule psychological impact that it has and just multiply that

285
00:25:19.24 --> 00:25:28.12
time is a billion to get to where these guys were and and what they went through so going back to

286
00:25:28.12 --> 00:25:37.32
the book here after the fighting it kind of settled um sledge Eugene sledge comes across some

287
00:25:37.32 --> 00:25:44.92
dead Japanese soldiers so now they're kind of patrolling and there's some other veterans that

288
00:25:44.92 --> 00:25:51.48
were with them and he's standing there looking at these dead Japanese bodies and a guy comes over and

289
00:25:51.48 --> 00:25:57.80
says sledgehammer don't stand there with your mouth open when there's all these good souvenirs laying

290
00:25:57.80 --> 00:26:03.96
around so he sees these dead Japanese and he's going to get some war booty he then removed a

291
00:26:03.96 --> 00:26:10.84
nambu pistol slipped the belt off the corpse and took the leather holster he pulled off the steel helmet

292
00:26:10.84 --> 00:26:16.60
reached inside and took out a neatly folded Japanese flag covered it with writing the veteran

293
00:26:16.60 --> 00:26:22.20
pitched the helmet on the coral where it clanked and rattled rolled the corpse over and started

294
00:26:22.20 --> 00:26:28.04
pulling through the combat pack the veterans buddy came up and started stripping the other Japanese

295
00:26:28.04 --> 00:26:33.72
corpses his take was a flag and other items he then removed the bolts from the Japanese

296
00:26:33.72 --> 00:26:37.88
rifles and broke the stocks against the coral to render them useless to infiltrators

297
00:26:39.96 --> 00:26:44.84
I hadn't budged or said a word just stood glued to the spot almost in a trance

298
00:26:45.72 --> 00:26:51.08
the corpses were sprawled where the veterans had dragged them around to get into their packs and pockets

299
00:26:52.68 --> 00:27:00.28
would I become this casual and calist about enemy dead I wondered would the war dehumanize me

300
00:27:00.28 --> 00:27:09.56
so that I too could feel strip enemy dead with such non-shalance the time soon came when it

301
00:27:09.56 --> 00:27:19.64
didn't bother me a bit I think again it's it's important to remember that this guy is a gentleman

302
00:27:19.64 --> 00:27:27.40
a kind soul and he knows and he's admitting that it came to a point where this this did not bother him at all

303
00:27:27.40 --> 00:27:34.52
back to the book within a few yards of this scene one of our hospital corpsmen worked in a small

304
00:27:34.52 --> 00:27:45.08
shallow deathdevil defile treating Marine wounded I went over and sat on the hot coral by him

305
00:27:45.08 --> 00:27:51.48
the corpsmen was on his knees bending over to young marine who just died on a stretcher a blood-soaked

306
00:27:51.48 --> 00:27:59.16
battle dressing was on the side of the Marines of the dead man's neck his fine handsome boy's face was

307
00:27:59.16 --> 00:28:06.68
asian what a pitiful waste I thought he can't be a day over 17 years old I think God his mother couldn't

308
00:28:06.68 --> 00:28:12.52
see him the corpsmen held the dead Marines chin tenderly between the thumb and fingers of his

309
00:28:12.52 --> 00:28:20.20
left hand and made the sign of the cross with his right hand tears streamed down his dusty,

310
00:28:20.20 --> 00:28:43.56
tanned grief-contorted face while he sobbed quietly obviously again we have a vision in our mind of what

311
00:28:43.56 --> 00:28:59.16
a service men is like what a marine is like and certainly that picture of a corpsmen which is

312
00:28:59.16 --> 00:29:03.88
actually a navy corpsmen if you don't know navy corpsmen work with the Marines and go into the

313
00:29:03.88 --> 00:29:13.80
field with Marines and train as Marines but you picture this navy corpsmen in trying to treat

314
00:29:13.80 --> 00:29:18.36
this man and losing him and out there in the middle of the battlefield battle field with tears

315
00:29:18.36 --> 00:29:34.76
streaming down his face that's what combat is moving to another section where you're about to see

316
00:29:37.16 --> 00:29:44.28
some near friendly fire here it is just then a marine tank took to our rear

317
00:29:44.28 --> 00:29:51.56
I'm sorry just then a marine tank to our rear mist took us for enemy troops as soon as my

318
00:29:51.56 --> 00:29:57.08
hand went up to drop the round down the tube a machine gun cut loose it sounded like one of ours

319
00:29:57.64 --> 00:30:02.76
and from the rear of all places as I peeped over the edge of the crater through the dust and smoke

320
00:30:02.76 --> 00:30:08.68
and saw Sherman tank in the clearing behind us the tank fired at 75 millimeter gun off to our right

321
00:30:08.68 --> 00:30:15.88
rear the shell exploded nearby around a bend in the same trail we were on I then heard the report

322
00:30:15.88 --> 00:30:21.16
of a Japanese field gun located there as it returned fire on the tank again I tried to fire

323
00:30:21.16 --> 00:30:28.84
but the machine gun opened up on us as before a surge of panic rose within me in a brief moment

324
00:30:28.84 --> 00:30:35.72
our tank had reduced me to from a well-trained determined assistant mortar gunner to a quivering

325
00:30:35.72 --> 00:30:42.44
mass of terror it was not just that I was being fired at by a machine gun that unnerved me so

326
00:30:42.44 --> 00:30:49.56
terribly but that it was one of ours to be killed by the enemy was bad enough that was a real

327
00:30:49.56 --> 00:30:56.60
possibility I had prepared myself for but to be killed by a mistake by my own comrades was something

328
00:30:56.60 --> 00:31:03.80
I found hard to accept it was just too much and that is what we call a blue on blue

329
00:31:03.80 --> 00:31:12.20
when friendlies shoot at friendlies and fraturicide is what it's called when brother kills brother

330
00:31:13.24 --> 00:31:22.68
and you know this is actually the opening of the book that late for my road extreme ownership

331
00:31:22.68 --> 00:31:31.000
the opening chapter is about this this happening and happening under my command to my guys

332
00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:42.68
when I'm the senior guy and that's why this idea that to be killed by mistake by my own comrades

333
00:31:42.68 --> 00:31:47.40
was something I found hard to accept this is the this is the mortal sin of combat

334
00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:56.84
and sometimes when I talk about my deployment to Ramadi and what it was like for us I say that

335
00:31:56.84 --> 00:32:04.44
basically every bad thing that could happen happened and this is definitely one of them

336
00:32:05.32 --> 00:32:10.20
is being in a situation where there was friendly fire and we were a number of situations like

337
00:32:10.20 --> 00:32:15.72
this none of them was bad as as the first one I talk about in the book and here's how these

338
00:32:15.72 --> 00:32:22.92
guys get it solved a volunteer crawled off to the left and soon the tanks ceased firing on us

339
00:32:22.92 --> 00:32:28.12
we learned later that our tankers were firing on us because we had moved too far ahead

340
00:32:28.68 --> 00:32:34.28
they thought we were enemy support for the field gun this also explained why the enemy

341
00:32:34.28 --> 00:32:40.92
shelling was passing over and exploding behind us tragically the marine who saved us by identifying

342
00:32:41.48 --> 00:32:48.36
us to the tanker was shot off the tank and killed by a sniper definitely one of the worst things in

343
00:32:48.36 --> 00:32:55.48
war you think you after worry about the enemy and things are so confusing and there's such

344
00:32:55.48 --> 00:33:00.36
mayhem out there that you you have to spend at least as much time if not more

345
00:33:01.56 --> 00:33:06.68
de-conflicting with your friendly troops as you do trying to figure out where the enemy is and

346
00:33:06.68 --> 00:33:14.84
killed them and it's it's it was definitely a fast learning curve for us in Ramadi learning and

347
00:33:14.84 --> 00:33:25.16
understanding and de-conflicting and wanting to be so absolutely certain of where everybody was

348
00:33:25.16 --> 00:33:30.84
and the term we would use and is used in military's front line trace where are your guys

349
00:33:30.84 --> 00:33:37.96
where is the most forward that they are and everybody needs to know that in fact and this might sound

350
00:33:37.96 --> 00:33:44.28
crazy so we'd have you know people have in their minds of a sniper position being you know two or three

351
00:33:44.28 --> 00:33:53.80
guys hidden very tactically and clandestine in Ramadi sometimes for our sniper overwatch position

352
00:33:53.80 --> 00:33:59.48
first of all sometimes we have 20 or 30 guys in there to secure a building so that the snipers

353
00:33:59.48 --> 00:34:05.56
and the machine gunners could work but on top of that in order to avoid there being a blue on blue

354
00:34:05.56 --> 00:34:16.28
we had giant aircraft marking panels so fluorescent orange 10 by 10 pieces of material that we

355
00:34:16.28 --> 00:34:21.56
would literally the guys would literally hang them over the side of the Overwatch positions to say

356
00:34:21.56 --> 00:34:27.48
here we are everyone don't shoot us oh bad guys you want to shoot us bring it and we'll kill you

357
00:34:28.28 --> 00:34:35.16
but that's that's the extent that that we would go to to ensure that you weren't going to get shot

358
00:34:35.16 --> 00:34:42.36
by American forces and there's you know life's got a a vignette in the book as well a story about

359
00:34:42.36 --> 00:34:47.64
that almost happening and I tell another one that that blue on blue stuff was a nightmare

360
00:34:47.64 --> 00:34:53.40
it was a nightmare to deal with and you know one thing I will say is we had that horrible

361
00:34:53.40 --> 00:34:59.32
one that resulted in an in an Iraqi soldier killed a friendly Iraqi soldier killed very early on in

362
00:34:59.32 --> 00:35:04.68
our deployment but we learned so much from it that we there was blue on blues that happened after

363
00:35:04.68 --> 00:35:13.16
that but then we never had them get out of control like that first event but again for those

364
00:35:13.16 --> 00:35:17.000
people that have never been in combat before and it was weird when life and I were writing the book

365
00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:22.44
you know we got done I said man we've got three stories that are based on some sort of blue on

366
00:35:22.44 --> 00:35:29.72
blue happening and we didn't plan it that way but again just to realize you know that's that's how

367
00:35:29.72 --> 00:35:35.40
much we were thinking about it that when we wrote about it three of the stories were just about hey

368
00:35:35.40 --> 00:35:39.08
preventing blue on blues having a blue on blue and then two of them were not preventing blue on blues

369
00:35:40.92 --> 00:35:46.20
and if you'd never been in a combat you would you would think about that it's so confusing

370
00:35:47.40 --> 00:35:55.32
it's so confusing that there were situations in Romadi where humvies fired on other humvies

371
00:35:55.32 --> 00:36:02.68
so so this is an American vehicle and it's not like the the insurgents had humvies I mean

372
00:36:02.68 --> 00:36:07.32
humvies a very distinctive looking vehicle and there were situations where in the confusion in the

373
00:36:07.32 --> 00:36:15.72
mayhem and with you know muzzle flashes humvies shot at other humvies that's how that's how crazy

374
00:36:15.72 --> 00:36:26.84
and chaotic combat can get back to the book moving forward and this is gonna go back into the

375
00:36:26.84 --> 00:36:35.72
shelling and I almost wasn't gonna talk about this but I had to there was nothing subtle or intimate

376
00:36:35.72 --> 00:36:42.12
about the approach and explosion of an artillery shell when I heard the whistle of an approaching one

377
00:36:42.12 --> 00:36:49.56
in the distance every muzzle in my body contracted I braised myself in a puny effort to keep from

378
00:36:49.56 --> 00:36:58.60
being swept away I felt utterly helpless as the fiendish whistle grew louder my teeth ground

379
00:36:58.60 --> 00:37:06.44
against each other my heart pounded my mouth dried my eyes narrowed sweat poured over me my breath

380
00:37:06.44 --> 00:37:14.52
came in short irregular gaskets and I was afraid to swallow less tight choke I always prayed

381
00:37:14.52 --> 00:37:21.72
sometimes out loud under certain conditions of range and terrain I could hear the shell approaching

382
00:37:21.72 --> 00:37:28.76
from a considerable distance thus prolonging this suspense into seemingly unending torture

383
00:37:30.12 --> 00:37:35.80
at the instant the voice of the shell grew the loudest it terminated in a flash and a deafening

384
00:37:35.80 --> 00:37:42.60
explosion similar to the crash of a loud clap of thunder the ground shook in the concussion hurt my

385
00:37:42.60 --> 00:37:49.48
ears shell fragments tore through the air tore the air apart as they rushed out worrying and

386
00:37:49.48 --> 00:37:57.40
ripping rocks and dirt clattered onto the deck as a smoke of the exploded shell dissipated

387
00:37:57.40 --> 00:38:06.92
and this is something I need to point out when you went when I when I before I was ever in combat

388
00:38:06.92 --> 00:38:12.36
and ever saw what mortars really did when you think of shrapnel and people think of shrapnel

389
00:38:12.36 --> 00:38:19.56
like how big do you think a piece of shrapnel is just take a guess so echo's actually

390
00:38:19.56 --> 00:38:23.72
a half two inches echo's holding up inch and a half two inches I actually thought smaller than that

391
00:38:23.72 --> 00:38:27.32
I thought you know what it's a little tiny thing and you get a scared to get to watch out these

392
00:38:27.32 --> 00:38:37.000
little tiny things on bigger artillery shells or mortar shells the the frag that comes off of them

393
00:38:38.12 --> 00:38:48.12
is a half an inch thick and it can be nine inches long 12 inches long jagged

394
00:38:48.12 --> 00:38:56.92
shards of metal you know they're just evil and and and that's why I would scary is the

395
00:38:56.92 --> 00:39:02.84
shrapnel oh yeah it can it can hit you and like puncture you like a bullet but it can also take

396
00:39:02.84 --> 00:39:07.80
your leg clean off or take your arm clean off or just just completely I mean just kill you instantly

397
00:39:07.80 --> 00:39:14.60
if it hits you in the torso but it's a it's a limb remover so it's much more horrifying than

398
00:39:14.60 --> 00:39:20.44
than than whatever envisioned it to be and and the reason the one of the reasons this sticks in my

399
00:39:20.44 --> 00:39:28.12
mind so well as getting morgard we were at in combat outpost falcon in downtown Ramadi we took

400
00:39:28.12 --> 00:39:33.96
some hundred twenty millimeter mortar shells in there and we you know the the company commander

401
00:39:33.96 --> 00:39:40.36
who was an awesome unbelievable guy he brought in a piece of frack and the thing I couldn't

402
00:39:40.36 --> 00:39:45.88
believe it when I saw it I was shocked at how huge it was he made a piece of like a random piece

403
00:39:45.88 --> 00:39:50.60
of the frack that had come off the mortar shells yeah blew off and you know bounced down the street

404
00:39:50.60 --> 00:39:54.68
didn't hit anybody and he picked it up and brought it in and said here's what's flying around the

405
00:39:54.68 --> 00:40:01.000
air wait so are these things that they load into the to the shell on the shell is the shell is

406
00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:06.20
in paste in metal and that's what the metal's for that when it blows up it just hits apart and

407
00:40:06.20 --> 00:40:11.72
gets people yeah you think when like when you see on TV about these I don't know these criminals

408
00:40:11.72 --> 00:40:17.24
or whatever they set pipe bombs yeah they put the down nails nails screws you think so this is like

409
00:40:17.24 --> 00:40:25.96
that times 10 yeah it's big and it's it's freaking horrifying dang that's another one I remember

410
00:40:25.96 --> 00:40:35.16
one of those same situation got hit with some mortars in cop falcon and laaf and his team were like

411
00:40:35.16 --> 00:40:43.80
300 meters away on a rooftop of a building and frack landed on them you know it didn't have the

412
00:40:43.80 --> 00:40:49.88
velocity to hurt anybody but it was raining down on them so it's probably a hot too oh yeah

413
00:40:49.88 --> 00:40:57.96
yeah horrible back to the book to be under a barrage of prolonged shelling simply magnified

414
00:40:57.96 --> 00:41:04.36
all the terrible physical and emotional effects of one shell to me our territory was an

415
00:41:04.36 --> 00:41:11.24
invention of hell the on rushing whistle and scream of the big steel package of destruction was

416
00:41:11.24 --> 00:41:20.20
the pinnacle of violent fury and the embodiment of pent up evil it was the essence of violence

417
00:41:20.20 --> 00:41:27.72
and of man's in humanity to man I developed a passion a passionate hatred for shells to be killed

418
00:41:27.72 --> 00:41:35.72
by a bullet seemed so clean and surgical but shells would not only tear and rip the body they tortured

419
00:41:35.72 --> 00:41:44.28
ones mind almost beyond the brink of sanity after each shell was run out after each shell I was

420
00:41:44.28 --> 00:41:52.52
run out limp and exhausted during prolonged shelling I often had to restrain myself and fight back

421
00:41:52.52 --> 00:42:00.76
a wild inexorable urge to scream to sob and to cry as pelu dragged on I feared that if I ever

422
00:42:00.76 --> 00:42:08.12
lost control of myself under shell fire my mind would be shattered I hated shells as much for

423
00:42:08.12 --> 00:42:15.08
their damage to the mind as to the body to be under heavy shell fire was to me by far the most

424
00:42:15.08 --> 00:42:24.28
terrifying combat experiences each time it left me feeling more for Lauren and helpless more fatalistic

425
00:42:24.28 --> 00:42:30.44
and with less confidence that I could escape the dreadful law of averages that reduced our numbers

426
00:42:32.28 --> 00:42:40.52
fear is many fasted and has many subtle nuances but the terror and desperation endured under heavy

427
00:42:40.52 --> 00:42:51.80
shell are by far the most unbearable and I think again the key point of that if you want to take

428
00:42:51.80 --> 00:42:59.48
something from that and apply it to life because most people that are listening to this podcast

429
00:42:59.48 --> 00:43:04.92
won't have to endure shelling other than those troopers that are out there on the front lines

430
00:43:04.92 --> 00:43:14.20
today God bless them those guys are out there they may have to deal with us and they will but for

431
00:43:14.20 --> 00:43:20.76
civilians from normal people it's the feeling of helplessness it's the feeling of lack of control

432
00:43:20.76 --> 00:43:29.24
that makes it so horrifying and so when you come up against things that you cannot control that's

433
00:43:29.24 --> 00:43:35.40
something to recognize that it is something that you cannot control that's what's scaring you that's

434
00:43:35.40 --> 00:43:43.40
what the fear is coming from and making it infinitely worse than something that you can control yeah

435
00:43:43.40 --> 00:43:56.12
you know another thing that they had to help them deal with the fear was the camaraderie

436
00:43:59.08 --> 00:44:06.84
and he talks a little bit about this talking about his company I realized that company k will

437
00:44:06.84 --> 00:44:15.48
killo I realized that company k had become my home no matter how bad a situation was in the company

438
00:44:15.48 --> 00:44:20.76
it was still home to me it was not just a lettered company in a numbered battalion in a number

439
00:44:20.76 --> 00:44:29.88
regiment in a numbered division it meant far more than that it was home it was my company I belonged

440
00:44:29.88 --> 00:44:37.000
in it and nowhere else most Marines I knew felt the same about their companies in whatever battalion

441
00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:43.80
regiment or marine division they happened to be in this was the result of or maybe a cause for

442
00:44:43.80 --> 00:44:49.24
our strong aspreet a core the Marine Corps wisely acknowledged this unit attachment

443
00:44:49.88 --> 00:44:55.16
men who recovered from wounds and returned to duty nearly always came home to their old company

444
00:44:55.16 --> 00:45:03.72
this was not misplaced sentimentality but a strong contributor to high morale a man felt that

445
00:45:03.72 --> 00:45:11.56
he belonged to his unit and had a niche among his buddies whom he knew and with whom he shared a mutual

446
00:45:11.56 --> 00:45:18.36
respect well didn't combat this sense of family was particularly important in the infantry

447
00:45:18.36 --> 00:45:26.36
where survival and combat efficiency often hinged on how well men could depend on one another

448
00:45:30.76 --> 00:45:36.92
a spree decor and now there's a section that I'm moving forward to

449
00:45:36.92 --> 00:45:47.88
and this section is called the stench of battle the sun board down on us like a giant heat lamp

450
00:45:49.24 --> 00:45:54.84
occasional rains fell on the hot coral merely evaporated like steam off hot pavement

451
00:45:55.64 --> 00:46:02.36
the air hung heavy and muggy everywhere we went on the ridges the hot humid air

452
00:46:02.36 --> 00:46:10.20
weaked with the stench of death a strong wind was no relief it simply brought the horned odor

453
00:46:10.20 --> 00:46:16.84
from an adjacent area Japanese corpses lay where they fell among the rocks and on the slopes

454
00:46:16.84 --> 00:46:22.28
it was impossible to cover them usually there was no soil that could be spated over them

455
00:46:22.28 --> 00:46:30.20
just the hard jagged coral the enemy dead simply rotted where they had fallen they lay all over

456
00:46:30.20 --> 00:46:35.40
the place in grotesque positions with puffy faces and grinning buck tooth expressions

457
00:46:37.08 --> 00:46:42.68
it was difficult to convey to anyone who is not experienced it the gassly horror of having

458
00:46:42.68 --> 00:46:50.60
your sense of smell saturated constantly with the putrid odor of rotting human flesh day after day

459
00:46:50.60 --> 00:46:57.24
night after night this was something the men of an infantry battalion got a horrifying dose of

460
00:46:57.24 --> 00:47:04.04
during the long protracted battle such as pelaloo in the tropics the dead became bloated and

461
00:47:04.04 --> 00:47:14.44
gave off a terrific stench within a few hours after death whenever possible we removed marine dead

462
00:47:14.44 --> 00:47:19.64
to the rear of the company's position there they were usually laid on stretchers and covered with

463
00:47:19.64 --> 00:47:25.08
ponchoes which stretched over the head of the corpse down to the ankles I rarely saw a dead

464
00:47:25.08 --> 00:47:31.56
marine left uncovered with his face exposed to the sun rain and flies somehow it seemed

465
00:47:31.56 --> 00:47:39.000
indecent not to cover our dead often though the dead might lie on the stretchers for some time

466
00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:45.000
and decompose badly before the busy grave registration crews could take them for burial

467
00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:53.88
in the division cemetery near the airfield added to the awful stench of the dead of both sides

468
00:47:53.88 --> 00:48:00.52
was the repulsive odor of human excrement everywhere it was all but impossible to practice simple

469
00:48:00.52 --> 00:48:05.16
elemental field sanitation on most areas of pelaloo because of the rocky surface

470
00:48:06.36 --> 00:48:10.52
field sanitation during maneuvers in combat was the responsibility of each man

471
00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:15.24
in short under normal conditions he covered his own waste with a scoop of soil

472
00:48:16.52 --> 00:48:21.08
at night when he didn't dare venture out of his foxhole he simply used to

473
00:48:21.08 --> 00:48:24.84
empty grenade can't destroy a ration cans and threw it out of his hole and scooped

474
00:48:24.84 --> 00:48:32.04
over it the next day if he wasn't under enemy fire that was not possible on pelaloo

475
00:48:34.52 --> 00:48:41.56
added to this was the odor of thousands of rotting discarded japanese and american rations

476
00:48:41.56 --> 00:48:49.08
at every breath one inhaled humid air heavy with countless repulsive odors I felt as though my

477
00:48:49.08 --> 00:48:59.96
lungs would never be cleansed of these valve vapors as I looked at the stains on the coral

478
00:49:00.60 --> 00:49:08.76
I recalled some of the eloquent phrases of politicians and newsmen about how gallant it was for a man

479
00:49:09.48 --> 00:49:15.56
to shed his blood for his country and to give life's blood for sacrifice and so on

480
00:49:15.56 --> 00:49:27.80
the word seemed so ridiculous only the fly is benefited so as patriotic and brave

481
00:49:30.84 --> 00:49:42.28
as Eugene sledge was the madness the madness even made him begin to question what this

482
00:49:42.28 --> 00:49:53.80
was all about and think about what these politicians would say and say that only the fly is benefited

483
00:49:57.08 --> 00:50:01.24
it's crazy how he went so detailed in the in the smells

484
00:50:04.36 --> 00:50:08.12
because you know when you watch movies and that's a part that you don't do it

485
00:50:08.12 --> 00:50:13.72
I'll try and everyone's in the guise covering his nose or something that indicate this smells bad

486
00:50:13.72 --> 00:50:18.52
but that doesn't stick in your mind the whole time maybe if they add like flies or something

487
00:50:20.52 --> 00:50:28.20
but how he illustrated how this was going on to the point where I never thought I'd ever catch a

488
00:50:28.20 --> 00:50:36.20
fresh breath you know basically this is going to stand it really adds that element of hell you know

489
00:50:36.20 --> 00:50:42.28
and they say that smell is one of the most impactful senses you have that can like spark memories

490
00:50:42.28 --> 00:50:47.08
the strong is you know no doubt about it and there's there is a smell there's a smell in Iraq obviously

491
00:50:47.08 --> 00:50:55.32
wasn't as bad as this but it was it's it's a bad smell yeah and for sure when something hits me

492
00:50:55.88 --> 00:51:01.72
if you're in a you know a strange place or a place where there's no it's not sanitary

493
00:51:01.72 --> 00:51:11.72
you can get that momentary remembrance of that smell yeah and this section called the stench

494
00:51:11.72 --> 00:51:23.08
combat is beyond just the smell which we'll get into now the grinding stress of prolonged heavy combat

495
00:51:23.08 --> 00:51:26.76
the loss of sleep because of night nightly infiltration raids

496
00:51:26.76 --> 00:51:35.48
the vigorous physical demands forced on us by the rugged terrain and the unrelenting

497
00:51:35.48 --> 00:51:42.68
suffocating heat were enough to make us drop in our tracks how we kept going and continue fighting

498
00:51:42.68 --> 00:51:51.16
I'll never know I was so indescribably weary physically and emotionally that I became fatalistic

499
00:51:51.16 --> 00:52:00.20
praying only for my fate to be painless thinking he's going to die and there's only prayer is that

500
00:52:00.20 --> 00:52:04.04
it's painless yeah that's three to believe in it like you know you're gonna die

501
00:52:06.04 --> 00:52:12.84
in addition to the terror and hardships of combat each day brought some new dimension of dread for me

502
00:52:13.64 --> 00:52:19.64
I witnessed some new ghastly macrob facet in the kaleidoscope of the unreal

503
00:52:19.64 --> 00:52:25.40
as though designed by some fiendish ghoul to cause even the most hardened and

504
00:52:25.40 --> 00:52:30.52
calloused observer among us to recoil and horror and disbelief

505
00:52:34.36 --> 00:52:40.28
late one afternoon a buddy and I returned from the gun pit in the fading light

506
00:52:41.48 --> 00:52:47.80
we passed a shallow deflade we hadn't noticed previously in it we're three marine dead

507
00:52:47.80 --> 00:52:51.32
they were lying on stretchers where they had died before their comrades had been forced to

508
00:52:51.32 --> 00:53:00.20
withdraw some time earlier as we moved past my buddy groaned Jesus I took a quick glance into the

509
00:53:00.20 --> 00:53:09.08
depression and recoil and revulsion and pity at what I saw the bodies were so badly decomposed

510
00:53:09.08 --> 00:53:14.60
and nearly blackened by exposure this was to be expected of the dead and the tropics

511
00:53:14.60 --> 00:53:21.24
but these marines had been mutilated hideously by the enemy one man had been

512
00:53:21.24 --> 00:53:27.32
decapitated his head lay on his chest his hands had been severed from his wrists

513
00:53:27.32 --> 00:53:35.08
and also lay on his chest near his chin in disbelief I stared at the face as I realized

514
00:53:35.08 --> 00:53:40.12
that the Japanese had cut off the dead marines penis and stuff that into his mouth

515
00:53:40.12 --> 00:53:47.000
the corpse next to him had been treated similarly the third had been butchered

516
00:53:47.72 --> 00:53:55.40
chopped up like a carcass torn apart by some predatory animal my emotions solidified into rage

517
00:53:56.04 --> 00:54:02.36
and to hatred for the Japanese beyond anything I had ever experienced from that moment on

518
00:54:02.36 --> 00:54:10.84
I never felt the least pity or compassion for them no matter what the circumstances my comrades

519
00:54:10.84 --> 00:54:16.68
would feel stripped their packs and pockets for souvenirs and take gold teeth but I never saw

520
00:54:16.68 --> 00:54:23.16
marine commit that kind of barbaric mutilation that the Japanese committed if they had access to

521
00:54:23.16 --> 00:54:42.84
our dead like I said it's a glimpse into the darkest part of humanity and I want people to think

522
00:54:42.84 --> 00:54:54.28
about that and remember that it's real it's real that dark part of humanity that we don't want

523
00:54:54.28 --> 00:55:09.88
to exist it exists evil exists and this is coming from a guy you know when he says that he never had

524
00:55:09.88 --> 00:55:19.32
any pity after this again and you if you go and watch the Pacific and you watch interviews with

525
00:55:19.32 --> 00:55:30.36
this guy you can absolutely feel like I said the the kindness oozes out of him but even he

526
00:55:30.36 --> 00:55:49.72
when confronting the darkness had to explore his own darkness and I'm jumping now to the end

527
00:55:49.72 --> 00:56:01.40
on August 8th we heard that the first atomic bomb had been dropped on Japan

528
00:56:02.44 --> 00:56:12.28
reports abound for a week about a possible surrender then on 15 August 1945 the war ended

529
00:56:12.28 --> 00:56:20.12
we received news with quiet disbelief coupled with an indescribable sense of relief

530
00:56:21.24 --> 00:56:27.48
we thought the Japanese would never surrender many refused to believe it

531
00:56:28.76 --> 00:56:39.24
sitting in stunned silence we remembered our dead so many dead so many maimed so many bright

532
00:56:39.24 --> 00:56:47.32
futures consigned to the ashes of the past so many dreams lost in the madness that

533
00:56:47.32 --> 00:56:56.20
didn't gulf us except for a few widely scattered shouts of joy the survivors of the abyss

534
00:56:56.20 --> 00:57:08.68
sat hollow wide and silent trying to comprehend a world without war war is brutish

535
00:57:08.68 --> 00:57:17.000
in glorious and a terrible waste combat leaves and indelible mark on those who are forced to

536
00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:26.12
endure it the only redeeming factors were my comrades incredible bravery and their devotion to

537
00:57:26.12 --> 00:57:32.28
each other marine court training taught us to kill efficiently and to try to survive

538
00:57:32.28 --> 00:57:41.96
but it also taught us loyalty to each other and love that a spree decor sustained us

539
00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:51.80
until the millennium arrives and countries cease trying to enslave others it will be necessary to

540
00:57:51.80 --> 00:57:58.92
accept one's responsibilities and be willing to make sacrifices for one's countries as my comrades did

541
00:57:58.92 --> 00:58:06.20
as the troops used to say if the country is good enough to live in it's good enough to fight for

542
00:58:07.96 --> 00:58:19.88
with privilege goes responsibility and that is another look at war

543
00:58:19.88 --> 00:58:35.88
and it's something that we can't ever forget that war is awful and that war is the darkness that

544
00:58:35.88 --> 00:58:49.56
I talk about and as Eugene Sledge says the only redeeming factor is the incredible bravery and

545
00:58:49.56 --> 00:58:58.28
devotion to each other and I've talked about that before what made war to me

546
00:58:58.28 --> 00:59:11.16
an incredibly life-altering experience it wasn't the darkness that I saw but the light of the bravery

547
00:59:13.80 --> 00:59:19.000
of those on the battlefield and I will add another redeeming quality to war

548
00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:30.44
and it's a question and that is what is the alternative so what if we had not stopped the brutal

549
00:59:31.88 --> 00:59:41.24
imperial Japanese empire what if we had not stopped the Nazis what if we had not fought a war against

550
00:59:41.24 --> 00:59:50.44
ourselves to enslave and today there's still evil in the world there's still darkness

551
00:59:51.72 --> 01:00:05.40
ISIS the cult of child rapists and sadists and torturers and murders and if we don't confront that evil

552
01:00:05.40 --> 01:00:18.52
and that evil goes unchecked the darkness prevails so we have to be a force of light against the

553
01:00:18.52 --> 01:00:30.20
darkness and as Eugene Sledge transformed partially in his brain we have to use the darkness and

554
01:00:30.20 --> 01:00:41.40
the evil ourselves to prevail that's the paradox and we have to remember that when men get so close to evil

555
01:00:44.36 --> 01:00:54.44
it leaves a mark and it leaves a scar and we must forgive them their trespasses and help them to

556
01:00:54.44 --> 01:01:03.000
heal if they need it so to the men and women who are fighting or who have fought against forces of

557
01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:19.32
evil in the world thank you if we were gonna dive into that to apply or think about that in context of

558
01:01:19.32 --> 01:01:38.68
normal people I would say just remember how horrible things can be and and enjoy that sunrise in the

559
01:01:38.68 --> 01:01:50.76
morning again that book is called with the old breed by Eugene Sledge and I hit some highlights

560
01:01:50.76 --> 01:02:01.64
but the entire book is incredible the HBO many series is called the Pacific watch it it's incredible

561
01:02:01.64 --> 01:02:14.60
and remember remember remember remember

562
01:02:18.92 --> 01:02:25.000
all right let's get to some questions some questions from the intro webs

563
01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:32.60
yes in that question okay and by the way there's been late in the game but good evening echo Charles

564
01:02:32.60 --> 01:02:38.28
good evening and thanks for joining thanks yeah I don't know when I start timing in no I'll get

565
01:02:39.88 --> 01:02:47.64
with with a book like this I mean I'm coming over here to the studio and it is in my mind I'm

566
01:02:47.64 --> 01:02:58.20
fired up and and I picture when I want to listen to a podcast I want to sit down I want to

567
01:02:58.20 --> 01:03:05.80
put the headphones on I want to press play and I want to get it I want to get after it I want

568
01:03:05.80 --> 01:03:12.28
something to get in my brain and start to make me think and that's what I was tonight when I got

569
01:03:12.28 --> 01:03:19.48
on track I said I said hey this is the this is the podcast and here we go and I just went into it

570
01:03:19.48 --> 01:03:25.24
yeah no you know there was no echo Charles in my brain at that note I know offense no no no no I

571
01:03:25.24 --> 01:03:29.80
don't want to be in your brain Brad do you think I like to listen anyway I don't know when

572
01:03:29.80 --> 01:03:34.84
a time in in fact I do know into time in one I have a question that's true that's true

573
01:03:34.84 --> 01:03:42.20
there's no reason so no I'll hear you say hey echo oh oh oh oh how's it going yeah let's cut

574
01:03:42.20 --> 01:03:47.88
out the small talk and let's get down to business we can small talk now now that I've released

575
01:03:48.76 --> 01:03:57.08
the the passion that I had and I was had brewing up in my brain because get remember I'm

576
01:03:57.08 --> 01:04:03.32
prepping these things so I'm going through this book for a week or two and I'm delving into it

577
01:04:03.32 --> 01:04:09.32
and I'm doing other watching YouTube videos of the bell-o-lou battle it's in my brain and it's

578
01:04:09.32 --> 01:04:17.24
wanting to get it's wanting to come out yeah yeah really so you just get trumped by that no offense

579
01:04:17.80 --> 01:04:27.16
nope none taken alright questions jocco how do you balance extreme ownership

580
01:04:27.16 --> 01:04:35.72
with holding others accountable for their actions and avoiding them using you so this is actually

581
01:04:35.72 --> 01:04:42.84
a question that I end up responding to on a fairly regular basis and there's really a couple

582
01:04:42.84 --> 01:04:50.04
different angles here that are going on the one of the the points here is the balance of extreme

583
01:04:50.04 --> 01:04:56.92
ownership versus holding others accountable and what that really means and or what another

584
01:04:56.92 --> 01:05:04.92
way of looking at that is it's really extreme ownership versus decentralized command so decentralized

585
01:05:04.92 --> 01:05:13.40
command is it's one of the laws of combat that life and I write about in the book decentralized command

586
01:05:13.40 --> 01:05:18.92
and what that means is everybody leads that means everybody's a leader and that's what you want

587
01:05:18.92 --> 01:05:26.20
and that is a that is a the complete opposite of extreme ownership so if extreme ownership

588
01:05:26.20 --> 01:05:32.68
I'm gonna own everything decentralized command is I'm gonna let everyone else lead so there's a real

589
01:05:33.56 --> 01:05:40.92
a real contradiction a real dichotomy there so what you have to do is balance it you have to balance

590
01:05:41.64 --> 01:05:50.92
that's the only way to to sort of rectify or or reconcile those two opposing forces

591
01:05:50.92 --> 01:05:56.12
because you do you do have to have extreme ownership of everything that is true and at the same

592
01:05:56.12 --> 01:05:59.80
time you have to have decentralized command because you can't be everywhere once and you have to

593
01:05:59.80 --> 01:06:09.000
let your frontline leaders lead so you have to balance them so that's one part of it is that you

594
01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:15.72
should if you feel yourself for instance if you feel like you can't get everything done and you're

595
01:06:15.72 --> 01:06:21.96
losing control or you're you're not able to execute everything because there's too much on your

596
01:06:21.96 --> 01:06:26.60
plate it means that you're not delegating enough it means that you're not your frontline

597
01:06:26.60 --> 01:06:33.40
troopers aren't stepping up and leading now so you've gone too far in one direction now if your

598
01:06:33.40 --> 01:06:39.24
leaders or if all of a sudden you're having to tell your leaders like hey you need to get this

599
01:06:39.24 --> 01:06:43.000
done hey what are you doing why aren't you taking initiative then that means you've gone too far

600
01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:47.96
in the other direction so you have to find the good balance and that's the that's the goal and

601
01:06:47.96 --> 01:06:52.60
again and I'll say it over and over again that's what makes leadership hard leadership the hardest

602
01:06:52.60 --> 01:06:57.48
thing about leadership is that there's opposing forces that you have to balance and if you could just

603
01:06:57.48 --> 01:07:01.32
pick the extreme and go with it and that made you a good leader anyone could do it but it's not it's

604
01:07:01.32 --> 01:07:09.48
it's the balance that makes you a good leader it's the balance that's challenging so now the other

605
01:07:09.48 --> 01:07:18.92
word so that's part of the question the other word is accountability and holding people accountable

606
01:07:18.92 --> 01:07:26.28
for their actions now this is where I'm gonna throw something out that people are not going to

607
01:07:26.28 --> 01:07:34.04
expect me to say because people always talk about accountability and I hear that all the time in

608
01:07:34.04 --> 01:07:40.28
businesses and they say yeah we really need accountability accountability accountability and years

609
01:07:41.72 --> 01:07:50.52
the issue I have with that you don't want to have to rely on accountability accountability

610
01:07:51.24 --> 01:07:58.04
is actually a grudge it's a tool and I'm not saying you never use it because sometimes you do have to

611
01:07:58.36 --> 01:08:01.96
use it you have to implement it if people aren't doing what they're supposed to do you have to hold

612
01:08:01.96 --> 01:08:10.04
them accountable but I will tell you this what you what you don't want is people that are doing

613
01:08:10.04 --> 01:08:17.24
their job only because you're holding them accountable that's not what you want you want people that

614
01:08:18.04 --> 01:08:24.28
take initiative and ownership of their job and they do it not because you want them to or because

615
01:08:24.28 --> 01:08:32.28
you're going to inspect them they do it because they own it they take extreme ownership of it that's

616
01:08:32.28 --> 01:08:41.72
what you want so if you were to ask people that work for me if I held them accountable and they would be like

617
01:08:41.72 --> 01:08:50.04
hmm not really I mean for instance weapons inspections so you know I'm in charge of a

618
01:08:50.04 --> 01:08:56.12
platoon or I'm in charge of a task unit and there's you know a couple hundred weapons or whatever a bunch of

619
01:08:56.12 --> 01:09:02.12
weapons and if you don't take care of those weapons and people don't maintain them and clean them and

620
01:09:03.96 --> 01:09:10.68
lubricate them properly they can rust very easily and so you know one of the things that you may have to do is

621
01:09:10.68 --> 01:09:18.52
do weapons inspections to make sure that my guys are cleaning their weapons and I can tell you

622
01:09:18.52 --> 01:09:32.20
I rarely if ever conducted actual weapons inspections the reason my guys my guys did it my guys

623
01:09:32.20 --> 01:09:40.12
owned it my guys wanted to be the best they wanted to always have the best possible reputation

624
01:09:40.68 --> 01:09:47.64
and so I don't have to go around inspecting their weapons because I knew that they were going to do it

625
01:09:47.64 --> 01:09:54.04
I knew that that my guys who were on board who understood why we were doing what we were doing

626
01:09:55.16 --> 01:10:00.12
who understood that we wanted to be the best and who were on board with trying to be the best

627
01:10:01.24 --> 01:10:08.12
said you know what you know we are going to make sure these weapons are the best possible and I learned this

628
01:10:08.12 --> 01:10:15.64
when I was in my second platoon my boss was an awesome guy and this is a guy that I've talked about

629
01:10:15.64 --> 01:10:23.24
before he was huge influence on me he was a prior enlisted seal who became an officer he was a combat

630
01:10:23.24 --> 01:10:31.08
veteran from the warnernada and he was a very humble guy and he's actually the guy that inspired me to

631
01:10:31.08 --> 01:10:37.08
become an officer because I said to myself well this guy is this guy made our lives so good maybe I could

632
01:10:37.08 --> 01:10:45.40
do that for 16 guys and a platoon someday but what I realized about him is he never held us accountable

633
01:10:45.40 --> 01:10:53.64
for anything but at the same time he infused accountability on us because what we wanted more than

634
01:10:53.64 --> 01:11:02.76
anything else was to do a good job for him and for them platoon that's that's how you get troops

635
01:11:02.76 --> 01:11:11.64
and teams aligned not by holding them accountable with imposed accountability but where they are

636
01:11:11.64 --> 01:11:19.08
inspired themselves to hold themselves accountable and I had a coaching call with a team the other

637
01:11:19.08 --> 01:11:26.84
day that was they were saying hey you know we really we would like to have you you know coach us

638
01:11:26.84 --> 01:11:32.28
because we're lacking in these areas and we really need we know what to do but we really need someone

639
01:11:32.28 --> 01:11:43.32
to hold us accountable to do it and I I was like listen I charge a lot of money and you guys would

640
01:11:43.32 --> 01:11:51.96
be stupid to give it to me you guys just simply lack the discipline to work for the team and make

641
01:11:51.96 --> 01:11:56.52
it happen and I threw this example I said you know if you're competing against another team and

642
01:11:57.56 --> 01:12:01.24
what I did was I moved into your house and I woke you up in the morning and I held you accountable

643
01:12:01.24 --> 01:12:06.52
for what you're supposed to do and I made you do it so we put the ultimate in accountability on top

644
01:12:06.52 --> 01:12:12.84
of them I said who would do better you guys with me waking you up in the morning and

645
01:12:13.56 --> 01:12:18.36
beating you until you accomplish what you're supposed to do I held you to the up the highest

646
01:12:18.36 --> 01:12:27.000
standard of accountability or a team that was hungry themselves that was going to go the extra

647
01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:31.88
mile that was going to do more work it was going to stay up later that was going to get up earlier

648
01:12:31.88 --> 01:12:37.72
not because somebody was holding them accountable but because they had the desire for victory

649
01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:46.04
who's going to win that contest and the answer is very simple those with the innate and intrinsic

650
01:12:46.04 --> 01:12:54.36
desire to win will win over those that have imposed discipline and accountability put on top of them

651
01:12:54.36 --> 01:12:59.64
yeah now because there's a dichotomy to everything and because there's a balanced everything

652
01:12:59.64 --> 01:13:06.04
there are times where an leadership position you do need to inspect and make sure that you

653
01:13:06.04 --> 01:13:11.88
hold people accountable and an example I have that is we had when we got to Ramani we had our

654
01:13:11.88 --> 01:13:18.20
radios and generally the radio men knew how to program the radios and and get them synced up so

655
01:13:18.20 --> 01:13:23.56
they could talk to other radios and all that and I told the guys I'm like listen everybody in the

656
01:13:23.56 --> 01:13:30.44
troop needs to know how to program your radio yourself and everyone says oh okay and

657
01:13:32.20 --> 01:13:36.84
it was so critical that they know how to program these radios because if you're out in the field

658
01:13:36.84 --> 01:13:41.000
and you get separated from your unit and all of a sudden your radio gets zeroized or it has a

659
01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:44.76
problem and you don't know how to fix it yourself what are you going to do you can't talk to anybody

660
01:13:44.76 --> 01:13:50.60
and you're doomed you're going to die so because it was that critical I actually after the first

661
01:13:50.60 --> 01:13:57.000
briefing I called a couple guys up and I said give me a radio and I zeroized their radios and I said okay

662
01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:04.52
reprogram it now and couple didn't know how to do it and I said okay listen up guys no one is going

663
01:14:04.52 --> 01:14:09.72
on operation if you can't reprogram your radio and so the guys had to sit down and go and figure

664
01:14:09.72 --> 01:14:14.60
how to do it so there's times where you you do have to hold people accountable and in that situation

665
01:14:14.60 --> 01:14:20.20
I knew that even though I was saying hey it's important they didn't realize how important it was

666
01:14:20.20 --> 01:14:23.32
because you know it was oh you got to know how to work your gear they kind of took it like that I

667
01:14:23.32 --> 01:14:28.04
knew that guys didn't really understand the nature of how important it was to be able to

668
01:14:28.04 --> 01:14:34.28
operate and reprogram your entire radio and sync it with the army radio and all that I knew that

669
01:14:34.28 --> 01:14:39.24
they didn't quite understand how important it was and so I had to I had to hold them accountable

670
01:14:39.24 --> 01:14:47.72
but generally 98% of the stuff I didn't have to hold people accountable I didn't inspect things I

671
01:14:47.72 --> 01:14:58.52
expected things and they delivered and and that's that's people will follow your lead if you take

672
01:14:58.52 --> 01:15:08.76
ownership that's how my guys have always been they've always seen that and and known what the

673
01:15:08.76 --> 01:15:15.000
expectations were and finally if if you're sitting there and you keep saying to yourself I

674
01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:21.48
got to hold people accountable I got to hold people accountable most likely you don't need to hold

675
01:15:21.48 --> 01:15:29.88
them accountable you need to lead them you need to make them understand why they're doing what they're

676
01:15:29.88 --> 01:15:36.36
doing why it's important how it impacts the strategic mission how it impacts the team how it impacts

677
01:15:36.36 --> 01:15:44.76
them that's leadership not accountability it's leadership accountability is just a tool and it

678
01:15:44.76 --> 01:15:56.92
is a it's a crude tool compared to real leadership so use it if you have to but try and use

679
01:15:56.92 --> 01:16:10.84
leadership instead next question juggle I'm entering the police academy in a few short weeks

680
01:16:10.84 --> 01:16:16.28
and I'll be a police officer after six months I have no military background and have very little

681
01:16:16.28 --> 01:16:22.36
experience with true confrontation in violence one of the best ways of police officer can condition

682
01:16:22.36 --> 01:16:29.24
themselves to violence and confrontation I currently change it to but I'm not I am but I am curious

683
01:16:29.24 --> 01:16:35.40
what else I can do to keep myself and others safe from unpredictable violence this is not a self-defense

684
01:16:35.40 --> 01:16:43.32
question or either a mental condition in question very cool question I appreciate that question

685
01:16:44.04 --> 01:16:51.64
because this individual recognizes that there's a little bit more to it than just the physical

686
01:16:51.64 --> 01:16:57.08
self defense and that's the mental and he's 100% right so here's some things that you can do

687
01:16:57.08 --> 01:17:08.28
when you get the opportunity you got to get some realistic training going and I've talked about

688
01:17:08.28 --> 01:17:13.40
a little bit on here with a kind of realistic training that we did in the SEAL teams there's things

689
01:17:13.40 --> 01:17:21.40
that up the intensity greatly some ammunition or like a paintball scenario another good thing is getting

690
01:17:21.40 --> 01:17:29.64
you know it's really heavy sparring equipment on so face gear you know and really go to town

691
01:17:29.64 --> 01:17:36.76
where you're trying to attack someone and take them down and do it you know three on one four on one

692
01:17:36.76 --> 01:17:42.28
gotta be careful not to get hurt you don't go that extreme but if someone puts on head gear you know

693
01:17:42.28 --> 01:17:51.32
with a face mask and a whole nine yards shin guards and padded out fit on and people can attack them

694
01:17:51.80 --> 01:17:56.68
and you have to react to it the other good thing to do is do it in a situation where you know you don't

695
01:17:56.68 --> 01:18:00.52
let the guy know what's gonna happen you know he's got to keep his eyes closed until you say go

696
01:18:00.52 --> 01:18:03.56
when he opens his eyes there's someone there where the knife right in front of a fake knife right in

697
01:18:03.56 --> 01:18:09.16
front of him is gonna stab when he's got a draws weapon and shoot or defend himself somehow so you want to

698
01:18:09.16 --> 01:18:16.12
hit him with these unexpected drills with your weapons without your weapon shooting and moving so those

699
01:18:16.12 --> 01:18:19.96
those are those are the kind of things as soon as you get the opportunity to do it and it's even good I

700
01:18:19.96 --> 01:18:29.64
mean if you've been in a in a in a in a in a shooting drill with like a barricade a shooter which is

701
01:18:29.64 --> 01:18:34.12
you know you put a shooter at the end of a hallway and he's hidden but he's shooting at you with paintball

702
01:18:34.12 --> 01:18:39.80
and you get you get the intensity up very high it's getting shot with paintball hurts and if you're

703
01:18:39.80 --> 01:18:43.64
getting nailed and you've got to do something and people are like I got to make all go do something you

704
01:18:43.64 --> 01:18:48.20
got to make it happen how you're gonna stop this guy you can get your intensity up and you can get used to that

705
01:18:48.20 --> 01:18:57.16
you can inoculate yourself someone to that stress and learn to detach yourself from it and not let it affect you

706
01:18:57.16 --> 01:19:05.80
and not let it grind on you so that's the realistic training and honestly I when I watch

707
01:19:06.44 --> 01:19:15.16
some of the police videos of the bad shootings now we know police officers throughout the country

708
01:19:15.16 --> 01:19:25.16
every day are under a burden of hostility and they do an outstanding job over and over again

709
01:19:25.16 --> 01:19:31.16
making great arrests and helping people and saving people that are suicidal incredible amount of things right

710
01:19:31.16 --> 01:19:36.76
of course no one releases those videos and they don't go viral the videos that go viral

711
01:19:37.16 --> 01:19:47.64
and the videos that people watch are the bad ones the bad ones and I hope that the police departments

712
01:19:47.64 --> 01:19:54.92
across America are doing something to inoculate their troopers from the stress because

713
01:19:54.92 --> 01:20:04.04
that when I watch these videos that is what I see happening the the stress level and the the

714
01:20:04.04 --> 01:20:11.64
inexperience of the stressful situation and there's one video that I watched which is awful

715
01:20:12.60 --> 01:20:19.08
and the guy gets a call you see is you see his the first thing you see oh no it's the whole thing

716
01:20:19.08 --> 01:20:23.96
is a body camera and and forgive me if someone pulls this video up and I'm not 100% accurate but

717
01:20:23.96 --> 01:20:30.28
he gets a call it's at a 7-11 guy with a gun guy pulls a new 7-11 the cop pulls into the 7-11

718
01:20:30.28 --> 01:20:35.96
as he gets out of his car and he sees a guy kind of walking one direction out of the 7-11

719
01:20:35.96 --> 01:20:41.56
turning and walking another direction guys got a hoodie on he's walking away so the cop gets out

720
01:20:41.56 --> 01:20:48.68
he's yelling at him hey stop stop stop the guy doesn't stop finally he's he's now approaching him

721
01:20:48.68 --> 01:20:52.76
and he's standing in the open and this is something that I see in a lot of these videos these

722
01:20:52.76 --> 01:20:59.56
cops they stand in the open when if you imagine that the other guy has a gun why would you stand in

723
01:20:59.56 --> 01:21:06.04
the open take cover you take cover that's the first thing you do if you're even if you're trying

724
01:21:06.04 --> 01:21:10.60
to stop somebody or trying to yell at someone you take cover so if they turn around or have a gun

725
01:21:10.60 --> 01:21:15.64
you only have a small portion your body exposed and you don't get scared because you're hanging

726
01:21:15.64 --> 01:21:21.88
out in the open so so anyways this guy is approaching he's standing out in the open he's yelling at

727
01:21:21.88 --> 01:21:27.96
the guy finally the guy turns around and when the guy turns around he reaches in his jacket

728
01:21:27.96 --> 01:21:35.88
and boom the cop shoots him the guy falls down he kind of rolls into a curb the cop comes over

729
01:21:36.84 --> 01:21:42.68
as soon as the cop comes over you very quickly realize what's going on and that is that the guy

730
01:21:42.68 --> 01:21:47.96
head headphones on underneath his hoodie and he couldn't hear the cop yelling at him and then

731
01:21:47.96 --> 01:21:53.96
as the cop searches him he pulls out of his pocket his iPhone and so he was just listening to music

732
01:21:53.96 --> 01:22:03.16
reaching his pocket to turn it off and he got shot horrible situation so how do you

733
01:22:03.16 --> 01:22:07.48
inoculate yourself to that you've got to put yourself into training situations where you do

734
01:22:07.48 --> 01:22:11.64
have the instinct to take cover will you do have the instinct to see what people's hands are

735
01:22:11.64 --> 01:22:15.72
will you do have the instinct to realize that you put yourself in a better situation

736
01:22:15.72 --> 01:22:22.28
where if the guy does pull out a gun you have time to react to it and you can react to it

737
01:22:22.28 --> 01:22:30.36
from a safer distance you know as so there's a lot of things I would love to start to and I don't

738
01:22:30.36 --> 01:22:35.64
know how you know I don't know how I'm I don't know how to go about this but I would love to start

739
01:22:35.64 --> 01:22:41.000
working with police departments and some manner to get some training set up like the training we had

740
01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:46.28
in the sealed teams which was the training that I set up in the sealed teams was psychotic

741
01:22:46.28 --> 01:22:52.44
how stressful we would make it so that these guys were overwhelmed they were as explosions

742
01:22:52.44 --> 01:23:00.04
machine gunfire paintball sitting in them smoke everywhere screaming civilians screaming wounded

743
01:23:02.04 --> 01:23:06.92
actors we'd hire actors that were amputees that have blood spurting all the places it was

744
01:23:06.92 --> 01:23:11.48
incredibly realistic and that way when guys got into combat like one of the first time I ever

745
01:23:11.48 --> 01:23:16.68
got shot on I was like okay here's what's going on so I hope at some point I can I can help the

746
01:23:16.68 --> 01:23:25.24
military with that now in addition to that as you're trying to knock yourself to this violence

747
01:23:25.24 --> 01:23:31.88
and get used to this watch those YouTube videos watch those YouTube videos of street fights

748
01:23:31.88 --> 01:23:41.24
of stupid encounters with bars with drunk people and bouncer's with the shoot or don't shoot

749
01:23:41.24 --> 01:23:47.16
scenarios with cops military situations where they have helmet cams on and you can see things

750
01:23:47.16 --> 01:23:51.000
happening and what you want to do you want to watch those videos I knew I want to pay attention

751
01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:56.68
to the people to the humans and watch the reactions and watch their movements and watch their

752
01:23:56.68 --> 01:24:03.48
body language and watch their expressions on their faces and see and judge and predict and go

753
01:24:03.48 --> 01:24:08.12
to another video and hit pause and say this is what I see right here this is what I think is about

754
01:24:08.12 --> 01:24:15.64
to happen and educate yourself on human nature because human nature is what you're going to be

755
01:24:15.64 --> 01:24:21.56
dealing with and violence is a part of human nature and sometimes things go violent and sometimes they

756
01:24:21.56 --> 01:24:29.16
don't so how do you predict that and if you're unsure which you will be how do you protect yourself

757
01:24:29.16 --> 01:24:35.16
first and give yourself the maximum amount of time to make a judgment call so you don't have to rush

758
01:24:39.24 --> 01:24:47.64
on top of that it's awesome that you're doing Gjitsu do boxing do moitai do wrestling

759
01:24:47.64 --> 01:24:52.44
so you get used to getting hit so you start to see what a person's face looks like when they're

760
01:24:52.44 --> 01:24:59.80
about to hit you so you start to see what changes in their their their their posture makes

761
01:24:59.80 --> 01:25:05.48
when they're about to throw a punch those are all things that will help you Gjitsu is obviously

762
01:25:05.48 --> 01:25:12.28
great for the grinding physical grappling situation but a lot of times hopefully as a cop

763
01:25:12.28 --> 01:25:16.20
most of the time you're not in that situation you're standing at a little bit of a distance

764
01:25:16.20 --> 01:25:25.000
and or you're you know you've got a little bit more time to judge so fight as much as you can

765
01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:31.96
watch those law enforcement and military videos again see the reactions see the noise see the

766
01:25:31.96 --> 01:25:38.28
fear see the panic look at people's eyes judge them predict what they're going to do press

767
01:25:38.28 --> 01:25:44.28
pause and figure out if you were right or wrong watch horrible violence happen so that you can

768
01:25:44.28 --> 01:25:51.48
understand it better so that you can handle it when the time arises yeah I would um and

769
01:25:51.48 --> 01:25:56.92
just kind of to add on some of the stuff you're saying I would even say compete if you can

770
01:25:57.48 --> 01:26:01.32
because a lot of times in training you can especially if you're training every day or

771
01:26:01.32 --> 01:26:07.16
pretty often you can get into the mindset that I can just train casual today and if a guy taps

772
01:26:07.16 --> 01:26:12.60
me out which everyone says it doesn't matter that much you know so when you compete that's that's

773
01:26:12.60 --> 01:26:18.04
one of the significant things that I got um more that I realized when I was competing it's your

774
01:26:18.04 --> 01:26:23.08
your your your senses are heightened because everything matters if you get taken down it matters

775
01:26:23.08 --> 01:26:29.64
if you go for a submission and you don't get it it matters in in competition so you have that

776
01:26:29.64 --> 01:26:35.88
that mindset more so and you'll get used to that mindset and to your point I tell this guys at

777
01:26:35.88 --> 01:26:43.08
GJ2 when you're training for competition no matter what we do just about no matter 98% of the time

778
01:26:44.52 --> 01:26:50.92
I can't get two guys in training to go as hard against each other as they're going to in competition

779
01:26:50.92 --> 01:26:57.08
as someone when someone gets a grip of your gear in competition yeah it is 10 times stronger

780
01:26:57.08 --> 01:27:03.08
then it is when you're training because if you rip if I get a grab your gear collar and you go

781
01:27:03.08 --> 01:27:06.60
through some effort to rip it away and we're training and we'll let it go because I don't care

782
01:27:07.40 --> 01:27:12.92
if it happens in competition and I only have seven minutes to work and get you submitted I'm

783
01:27:12.92 --> 01:27:17.48
hanging on to that thing I'm gonna hang on to it hard and I'm not gonna let go and so you end up with

784
01:27:17.48 --> 01:27:26.76
a much much much more intense seven minutes in a competition or three minutes in a boxing

785
01:27:26.76 --> 01:27:34.12
sparring match or in a moitai the intensity you cannot simulate the intensity in training that

786
01:27:34.12 --> 01:27:39.96
you're gonna get in in competition and take that one step further when you get into a life and

787
01:27:39.96 --> 01:27:46.04
death struggle you're gonna have the same level of jump to the intensity that's gonna be there so

788
01:27:46.04 --> 01:27:49.64
that's a good point as well yeah and that kind of goes for moitai as well I'm not even necessarily

789
01:27:49.64 --> 01:27:54.60
saying competing moitai but moitai is a good one because you brought you get cracked in your body

790
01:27:54.60 --> 01:28:00.92
in your legs and you get to feel some pain and if you're not used to that okay before I even

791
01:28:00.92 --> 01:28:08.12
started moitai I went and you remember Terry so could you he was like hey you know we we've trained

792
01:28:08.12 --> 01:28:12.52
jujitsu together so I was like hey I'm training MMA today come let's spar with me my other partner

793
01:28:12.52 --> 01:28:15.96
doing and I was like hey I don't have any striking experiences like oh I don't care you know

794
01:28:15.96 --> 01:28:22.52
jujitsu so just train with me so yeah so that he punched me in the face really hard and that was

795
01:28:22.52 --> 01:28:27.56
you know and I was like man just how you're talking about this crash grenade before it was kind of

796
01:28:27.56 --> 01:28:32.92
like that just the fact that I got played didn't knock me out it didn't days meet in that way it was just

797
01:28:32.92 --> 01:28:37.48
the fact that dang I wasn't used to this I didn't know he was just gonna start punching me in my face

798
01:28:37.48 --> 01:28:43.24
you know I thought we were just gonna warm up so that's actually the main thing that made me go into

799
01:28:43.24 --> 01:28:49.32
moitai specifically so he used to get cracked yeah because I was like I'm not even I thought I was

800
01:28:49.32 --> 01:28:55.000
pretty good at jujitsu so I figured you know like I was I was solid you know but it was so what if I

801
01:28:55.000 --> 01:29:01.000
get into something you know outside of the gym like I cracked me in my face and I'm not used to it yeah you

802
01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:08.84
know so man so the what the moitai did help is when you get hit in the face it's like jujitsu

803
01:29:08.84 --> 01:29:12.92
someone grinding on you and they're breathing all in your nose or they're sweating all in your

804
01:29:12.92 --> 01:29:17.24
eye or whatever that doesn't bother you at all you barely noticed it and jujitsu doesn't matter

805
01:29:17.24 --> 01:29:22.28
right so the same thing with moitai when you get punched in the nose and it's bleeding and you see

806
01:29:22.28 --> 01:29:27.16
your own bladder whatever but if you're not used to that you that'll mess you up and if you notice

807
01:29:27.16 --> 01:29:31.16
back in the day like they're old UFC's or whatever guys will get cracked in the face like

808
01:29:31.16 --> 01:29:34.76
three four times hard and they'll be the whole tap and hold me calm you know because they're just

809
01:29:34.76 --> 01:29:39.48
not used to it nowadays guys were just but they won't they won't shut the other referee got a

810
01:29:39.48 --> 01:29:44.84
stop because they're used to it rarely does anyone tap and UFC front strikes yeah very rarely unless

811
01:29:44.84 --> 01:29:52.92
they're like injured even then you won't worry McDonald did no yeah so anyway so the point is

812
01:29:52.92 --> 01:29:58.36
so moitai situation and specific because that's where you feel the most pain like more than boxing

813
01:29:58.36 --> 01:30:01.96
like even even I mean you'll take brain injury for sure but it's not actual pain

814
01:30:01.96 --> 01:30:07.40
moitai get kicked in the leg and they teach you to hide the pain and to not let it affect you

815
01:30:07.40 --> 01:30:13.08
and go in the end and the ribs like body like knees to the ribs is super painful when you get used to

816
01:30:13.08 --> 01:30:17.72
that I think that out because like if you're in a situation street some cracks you hard in the face

817
01:30:17.72 --> 01:30:25.16
you know what's interesting about that though is that there are some people that can can

818
01:30:25.96 --> 01:30:33.08
easily or more easily take the pain of moitai or boxing like it's okay with them

819
01:30:34.20 --> 01:30:41.24
then then they then they can take the grind of jujitsu and some people can take the grind of jujitsu

820
01:30:41.24 --> 01:30:49.000
all day long but they can never take the striking pain so it's there's just some genetic or mental

821
01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:56.68
situations but to your point you need to be comfortable with both those situations yeah and at the

822
01:30:56.68 --> 01:31:01.48
very least just familiar with it oh like I said that's first punch that I took in my face

823
01:31:02.04 --> 01:31:06.92
and grinded it was I wasn't ready for him to just bail I mean you played a fun football too yeah

824
01:31:06.92 --> 01:31:12.52
I mean so you've been hit you've been knocked out before on the field. So it's kind of if I

825
01:31:12.52 --> 01:31:18.20
would try to remember it it was a combination of sure that physical impact but just the fact that

826
01:31:18.20 --> 01:31:22.28
this guy just punched him in my face right now so it's almost like dang it just punched me

827
01:31:22.28 --> 01:31:26.84
my face right now I thought we're gonna yeah I didn't like that but yeah after a while

828
01:31:27.56 --> 01:31:31.32
it doesn't man the hardest I ever got punched in the face was from Greg right in the like right

829
01:31:31.32 --> 01:31:37.56
between my eyes and it was like happens since he threw a real solid one as I went to kind of

830
01:31:37.56 --> 01:31:44.28
shoot he was kind of coming up off his knees kind of and I went to shoot like I got from off my back

831
01:31:44.28 --> 01:31:49.80
and then forward and shot forward and he just went boom and the the the the force of me shooting

832
01:31:49.80 --> 01:31:55.08
forward and went boom and I felt it in my neck is really bad but it was in a hard part yeah lucky

833
01:31:55.08 --> 01:32:00.76
other than K-Ode but yeah fully that was a K-O punch it just happened to be in that really hard part um

834
01:32:01.56 --> 01:32:06.60
but I had been through that before I trained my way before and it didn't it didn't even slow me down

835
01:32:06.60 --> 01:32:10.20
I remember thinking that was probably the hardest punch I ever took and it was with the MMA

836
01:32:10.20 --> 01:32:14.20
glove it wasn't with a big boxing glove well yeah back in the old days we used to just spark

837
01:32:15.96 --> 01:32:23.64
full on with just MMA gloves on a regular basis yeah stupid yeah and but don't do that folks yeah

838
01:32:23.64 --> 01:32:28.68
yeah don't do that that's a whole but what I'm saying is that that was you are used to it good again

839
01:32:28.68 --> 01:32:33.16
I was used to it it didn't slow me down if that was like the situation where I took that kind of hard hit

840
01:32:34.36 --> 01:32:37.56
in a you know or a cop would take that kind of hard hit and they're used to that in training

841
01:32:37.56 --> 01:32:41.48
whatever that's not gonna slow him down that's not gonna stun him unless it's physically stuns

842
01:32:41.48 --> 01:32:46.04
like it's some of the jobs yeah and that's you know even if you're trained that's that's that's

843
01:32:46.04 --> 01:32:52.36
gonna um that's gonna change in fact if you train too much and you get yourself hit too often you'll

844
01:32:52.36 --> 01:32:58.20
actually decrease your ability to withstand punishments yeah you've careful about that

845
01:32:58.20 --> 01:33:02.04
yeah you want to train enough that you're used to it you want to know that you can take it but

846
01:33:02.04 --> 01:33:09.08
then you don't want to over train at all yeah you never get better it take well no let me phrase that

847
01:33:09.08 --> 01:33:14.12
you get better at taking punches for a short period of time and then it goes starts to go backwards

848
01:33:14.12 --> 01:33:19.24
yeah you know unfortunately that's just the way the the body's built and you can see as some of the

849
01:33:19.24 --> 01:33:24.60
older UFC fighters get older you know there's no doubt they don't have the chin that they

850
01:33:24.60 --> 01:33:29.64
once had and that's when they usually you know decide to hang it up if they if they if they get

851
01:33:29.64 --> 01:33:35.96
the right counsel from people yeah but nowadays people are sparring a lot less and they're trying

852
01:33:35.96 --> 01:33:42.60
to not take all that punishment because everyone realizes that you have a you have a limited number

853
01:33:42.60 --> 01:33:48.36
of hits you can take to the to the head and then it starts to go backwards and it's a you know

854
01:33:48.36 --> 01:33:54.36
a lot of this information is coming from the the soldiers overseas the Marines overseas that have

855
01:33:54.36 --> 01:34:01.32
taken concussions and ID strikes and they're realizing that that is a permanent you know downgrade

856
01:34:01.96 --> 01:34:07.48
of their systems and they they you know so they so they that's where a lot of this information

857
01:34:07.48 --> 01:34:11.000
came from about football this concussions stuff and football a lot of that is coming from

858
01:34:11.72 --> 01:34:17.000
the the ID's that are soldiers and Marines have taken overseas and they've realized that this

859
01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:23.48
terminated traumatic brain injury is problematic and so we need to we need to watch out for it so

860
01:34:23.48 --> 01:34:27.64
yeah especially if you're being a cop and you gotta be alert yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah but that's why

861
01:34:27.64 --> 01:34:32.28
and that's why like the Muay Thai that's why I personally I did because it was a lot of like

862
01:34:32.28 --> 01:34:38.60
clinching knees and that's if you if you've never done it you would think that being punched in the

863
01:34:38.60 --> 01:34:43.48
nose square and the nose real hard would be probably one of the more painful things but it wasn't

864
01:34:43.48 --> 01:34:48.84
compared to the ribs and the legs man so if you're kind of used to just just taking impacts and pain

865
01:34:49.88 --> 01:34:55.48
yeah you just you just and not to mention the physical part but just mentally like when that one

866
01:34:55.48 --> 01:35:00.28
that comes about you can just just keep on keeping on now yeah because you're used to it

867
01:35:00.28 --> 01:35:07.56
or you're not even me from a yeah inoculate inoculate yourself inoculation okay next question

868
01:35:07.56 --> 01:35:15.16
dockle I have three little girls and I'm really intrigued by Brazilian jujitsu what form of martial art

869
01:35:16.52 --> 01:35:25.64
would you put your kids in that's an easy yeah put your kids into jujitsu do it immediately

870
01:35:26.28 --> 01:35:31.56
we kind of covered this last podcast and that is the fact that if you if you've got a

871
01:35:31.56 --> 01:35:35.40
teacher gets luck don't get in a street fight don't get into a fight in the playground if someone

872
01:35:35.40 --> 01:35:42.04
wants to fight you run away and that's what they should do and you know later when they start to

873
01:35:42.04 --> 01:35:49.64
become mature enough to make real decisions that should guide them and occasionally as a man

874
01:35:49.64 --> 01:35:56.60
you may have to stand your ground and fight and that's understandable but as a little kid who might be

875
01:35:56.60 --> 01:36:02.60
getting picked on by bigger kids hey oh somebody gets in your face run away if you really think

876
01:36:02.60 --> 01:36:08.36
you're gonna get hurt run away so you have that self defense mechanism already what you don't have

877
01:36:08.36 --> 01:36:15.24
and what you are not born with is when that bully grabs you and pulls you to the ground or

878
01:36:15.24 --> 01:36:19.64
grabs you and holds onto you and won't let you leave that is when you need to know how to grapple

879
01:36:20.28 --> 01:36:26.68
and jujitsu is what teaches you how to grapple so eventually like you just said you do want your

880
01:36:26.68 --> 01:36:33.16
kids to spar a little bit you do want your kids to know how to throw some good combinations there right

881
01:36:33.16 --> 01:36:38.20
I mean they should know how to do that you know actually the other night I was working with Dean

882
01:36:38.20 --> 01:36:41.80
we were working with a couple people and just going he was going over some basics of defense and there

883
01:36:41.80 --> 01:36:47.24
are some legit basics self defense moves that people should know you know someone bear hugged you

884
01:36:47.24 --> 01:36:54.68
someone had blocks you now we don't think about them at the high level of jujitsu because we we welcome

885
01:36:54.68 --> 01:36:59.56
someone head locking us well come that stuff because we're so used to it it's we have an advantage

886
01:36:59.56 --> 01:37:04.52
when we get there but to a kid you get thrown into a headbock a first street fight I ever got the first

887
01:37:04.52 --> 01:37:09.000
guy kick all the street fight the first time I ever got to a fight was you know like four for fifth grade

888
01:37:09.72 --> 01:37:16.20
and this kid who was definitely way stronger than me grabbed me in a headlock was holding me on the

889
01:37:16.20 --> 01:37:21.32
ground and punched me in the head and I did couldn't do anything and you know it got broken up after

890
01:37:21.32 --> 01:37:27.96
twenty seconds by the principal but oh okay you know okay that that wasn't cool so what you want

891
01:37:27.96 --> 01:37:32.04
your kid because if that kid would have tried to attack me when I was standing up I could just run away

892
01:37:32.04 --> 01:37:36.68
from him but once he grabbed a hold of me all of a sudden I can't do anything so that's why

893
01:37:36.68 --> 01:37:40.68
jujitsu is the first thing you want to learn it's also as I said last time it's the most technical

894
01:37:40.68 --> 01:37:49.80
thing there's the most to learn it's never ending knowledge quest so you want to get on that

895
01:37:49.80 --> 01:37:56.84
quest as early as possible now on top of that and what's really good about jujitsu and again this

896
01:37:56.84 --> 01:38:02.76
is something that I've talked about before but when you talk about traditional martial arts and you

897
01:38:02.76 --> 01:38:12.04
imagine you know a traditional martial arts dojo where people in plain white guise are standing in a

898
01:38:12.04 --> 01:38:19.96
very clean and Spartan facility with samurai swords hanging on the wall and they're bowing to the

899
01:38:19.96 --> 01:38:29.56
sensei that implies a certain amount of knowledge will be passed and a certain amount of

900
01:38:29.56 --> 01:38:36.60
etiquette will be passed and the etiquette and the knowledge that we passed will be toughness

901
01:38:36.60 --> 01:38:44.04
and confidence and humility and as a matter of fact if you go to a traditional martial arts school

902
01:38:44.04 --> 01:38:49.24
and you bring your kid in there and you say I want my kid to train what will he get out of it

903
01:38:49.24 --> 01:38:53.48
one of the things they're going to say is he's going to learn to be confident or she's going to

904
01:38:53.48 --> 01:39:03.000
learn humility and they will teach them that verbally it will be a lesson it will be a

905
01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:13.08
book almost a book lesson on this is humility and this is confidence and hold your head high

906
01:39:15.48 --> 01:39:26.44
jujitsu teaches those things not theoretically but for real because in jujitsu you will get humbled

907
01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:32.44
you will get humbled by a person that's smaller than you by someone that's weaker than you they will

908
01:39:32.44 --> 01:39:38.92
submit you they will hold you down and you won't be able to do anything about it and that is

909
01:39:38.92 --> 01:39:46.44
humility and that is where you learn humility and jujitsu and same thing with confidence you know

910
01:39:46.44 --> 01:39:55.32
you will learn as you get better jujitsu that hey I know something and I know I can handle myself

911
01:39:55.32 --> 01:40:06.76
in bad situations so it truly teaches humility and confidence not theoretically but in a very

912
01:40:06.76 --> 01:40:14.12
practical sense yeah so get your kids down to the jujitsu school get them enrolled and you know we

913
01:40:15.16 --> 01:40:20.68
we did a podcast where we talked about how to find a good jujitsu school so find a good reputable place

914
01:40:20.68 --> 01:40:25.64
and get your kids down there and you know what when you bring your kids in to start jujitsu get your

915
01:40:25.64 --> 01:40:31.72
dang self on the mat too because you gotta know it and it's everybody should know it yeah and

916
01:40:31.72 --> 01:40:37.48
except for bullies and evil people they should be banned do jujitsu because it's too powerful yeah yeah

917
01:40:37.48 --> 01:40:46.60
way too much another element that you might not think of right off the bat but the fact that you'll

918
01:40:46.60 --> 01:40:53.88
meet friends because jujitsu for whatever reason I mean it just might be the culture in general but

919
01:40:53.88 --> 01:40:58.44
when you go to like the jujitsu mat you go on the mat it's not like how you're saying like a traditional

920
01:40:58.44 --> 01:41:03.08
martial arts school where you're like don't talk bow be rigid stand like this while the

921
01:41:03.08 --> 01:41:07.80
senses talking say yes or no sir it's it's really I mean in my experience that I've been to a

922
01:41:07.80 --> 01:41:12.92
lot especially here in in Southern California there that's where most of them are um it's real

923
01:41:12.92 --> 01:41:18.12
even though the more rigid ones are casual before class you can talk even during class as long as

924
01:41:18.12 --> 01:41:22.68
you're not talking while the instructors yeah do you want to do that in a school you wouldn't

925
01:41:22.68 --> 01:41:28.12
do that anywhere yeah exactly you know but you know your practicing moves it's it's um of course

926
01:41:28.12 --> 01:41:33.32
he don't want to deviate too much from the lesson but it's just more social and so you talk after

927
01:41:33.32 --> 01:41:40.44
class and you'll find that that the atmosphere is really conducive to gravitating towards people

928
01:41:40.44 --> 01:41:46.28
that that have the same interests of you even outside of jujitsu and kids especially men because

929
01:41:46.28 --> 01:41:50.20
usually the teachers are way more lenient with kids when they're running around and you know you

930
01:41:50.20 --> 01:41:54.12
you're telling them go do this move and they might be talking a little bit about something or

931
01:41:54.12 --> 01:42:00.60
whatever if they're having fun which it is very fun um they're just gonna want to do it some more

932
01:42:00.60 --> 01:42:05.80
my daughter's two and we found a place that that could facilitate a two-year-old situation and

933
01:42:05.80 --> 01:42:09.64
she would always look forward to because the issues think it's just one big display house the

934
01:42:09.64 --> 01:42:14.92
rough housing the whole time it's the ultimate dream for a kid yeah a room with padded floors and

935
01:42:14.92 --> 01:42:19.96
padded walls yeah you can grab the clothes rough house all you want yeah people to the ground yeah

936
01:42:19.96 --> 01:42:25.16
you're not gonna get punched or cake or you know yeah it's um yeah so there is a

937
01:42:26.44 --> 01:42:34.84
good community aspect to jujitsu yeah it's very much so which echo likes very much so

938
01:42:34.84 --> 01:42:42.20
sometimes I don't even want to roll I just want to come and talk sometimes that's often the

939
01:42:42.20 --> 01:42:51.96
situation with that jujitsu juggle willing so basically being a new leader overcoming friction

940
01:42:52.76 --> 01:42:58.44
in the new organization that's this that's what this guy is he's there you know he's a new leader

941
01:42:58.44 --> 01:43:03.32
overcoming friction in the organization and penetrating insights yes and I think what's important here is

942
01:43:03.32 --> 01:43:08.60
this is he's not a new leader like newly commissioned leader stepping up in the ranks he's in a new

943
01:43:08.60 --> 01:43:15.48
organization so he's stepping into a new organization is the new leader in a new situation

944
01:43:15.48 --> 01:43:21.40
we've kind of talked about stepping up from within the organization how are you going and stepping

945
01:43:21.40 --> 01:43:28.28
into a new organization now I'm gonna look at this from a perspective of like a normal transition

946
01:43:28.28 --> 01:43:34.44
into a leadership position and a new job or something like that not a hostile takeover situation

947
01:43:34.44 --> 01:43:41.80
maybe we can address that on a later time but not a situation where hey they fired this guy

948
01:43:41.80 --> 01:43:47.16
he had a bad reputation the things are going wrong you're gonna step in and change it because that

949
01:43:47.16 --> 01:43:53.96
that would take a different leadership approach then the one that I that I would take and that I

950
01:43:53.96 --> 01:43:58.12
have taken where you're stepping into a situation where things are going okay and you put your

951
01:43:58.12 --> 01:44:02.36
coming in and you've got some goals and there's so you're taking over leadership position it happens

952
01:44:02.36 --> 01:44:11.000
all the time so a couple of things about this first of all you stepping to a new leadership role

953
01:44:11.64 --> 01:44:19.000
you gotta talk to people but you mostly gotta listen you gotta find out why they're doing

954
01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:23.08
things the way they are because a lot of times there might be reasons for the way things are

955
01:44:23.08 --> 01:44:28.04
happening that you don't understand or that aren't really particularly evident so you really want

956
01:44:28.04 --> 01:44:33.24
to not make the judgments because you're bringing your own experience and you've done this a

957
01:44:33.24 --> 01:44:36.68
thousand times and that's why you're the new leader and that's why they put you in here you

958
01:44:36.68 --> 01:44:43.56
got to set that aside and say okay explain me why this process is in place or where did this process

959
01:44:43.56 --> 01:44:48.28
come from what is this process trying to prevent so that way you're getting smarter and you're learning

960
01:44:48.28 --> 01:44:56.76
and you're not being you're not imposing your ideas which you don't have any background for you

961
01:44:56.76 --> 01:45:02.20
don't you know you may have been a leadership in a different company or a different unit before

962
01:45:02.20 --> 01:45:09.80
and you think you know but you don't know so be humble and check yourself you gotta be friendly

963
01:45:09.80 --> 01:45:15.16
to people but at the same time you gotta be reserved now this is this is tricky because

964
01:45:15.16 --> 01:45:21.48
you are trying to build relationships you absolutely are trying to build relationships that's what

965
01:45:21.48 --> 01:45:26.52
life is that's what business is that's what war is that's what everything is about building

966
01:45:26.52 --> 01:45:32.84
relationships with these other humans so you want to be friendly to people but at the same time

967
01:45:32.84 --> 01:45:38.36
from a leadership perspective you can't just come in and be Mr. Nice guy and best friends with

968
01:45:38.36 --> 01:45:45.88
everybody that's not gonna work out for you for a couple reasons number one you don't know

969
01:45:47.40 --> 01:45:54.04
the the face that people are gonna present you out of the gate is not necessarily

970
01:45:55.000 --> 01:46:00.12
the true face of that person so you may check in your first day and this guy hey it's great to meet

971
01:46:00.12 --> 01:46:04.36
you so good to have you on board heard a lot about you and you go wow this guy's and he's

972
01:46:04.36 --> 01:46:07.80
ticked starts giving you some back-own information about things that are going and by the way we got

973
01:46:07.80 --> 01:46:11.000
a couple things that are a little messed up you know and I can point them out to you but that guy

974
01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:20.20
might be working as a gender so you gotta be cautious as you go in and the other piece of that is

975
01:46:20.20 --> 01:46:27.40
it is much easier to reel back in slack or sorry it's much easier to give out that friendship

976
01:46:27.40 --> 01:46:31.88
later then it is if you go overboard and you become everyone's best friend and now you got to

977
01:46:31.88 --> 01:46:37.72
cut it off yeah that was done you become a jerk yeah so it's much easier to to

978
01:46:38.68 --> 01:46:43.56
give out the slack when you want to later then it is to give out a bunch of slack and then try and

979
01:46:43.56 --> 01:46:48.76
reel it back in and be a jerk yeah and it makes it hard for both parties that's why in

980
01:46:48.76 --> 01:46:53.000
that case yeah but it's gonna be really hard the only reason you're pulling back the friendship

981
01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:58.36
thing is because it started going sideways and that makes it even harder it's a nightmare

982
01:46:58.36 --> 01:47:05.16
uh gotta watch out for the gossip because everyone's gonna want to whisper in your hair the

983
01:47:05.16 --> 01:47:09.96
things about the things about the people and this and that so you gotta be careful nod your head

984
01:47:09.96 --> 01:47:15.80
take it and but unbored but take it with a great assault definitely don't encourage it

985
01:47:16.36 --> 01:47:22.44
yeah and that can be a hard part for certain types of people will say because let's face him and

986
01:47:22.44 --> 01:47:26.44
that can be some interesting stuff yeah and there can be some knowledge to be gained there but you

987
01:47:26.44 --> 01:47:33.32
just have to be careful you want to hear some insights right but be careful when the insights

988
01:47:33.32 --> 01:47:38.68
crossover into gossip yeah and be careful that the insights are coming from people that might have

989
01:47:38.68 --> 01:47:44.28
agendas in fact they are coming from people that have agendas because everybody has agendas

990
01:47:44.28 --> 01:47:49.16
and maybe the person has a positive agenda which is to improve the company or improve the unit or

991
01:47:49.16 --> 01:47:56.68
improve the team but they also might have a agenda of improving their own station in life so you

992
01:47:56.68 --> 01:48:04.84
have to be careful of that they are watching you they are watching you and you coming to take over

993
01:48:04.84 --> 01:48:11.48
they are watching you so act accordingly think about the fact that they are watching you

994
01:48:11.48 --> 01:48:20.44
like I said use caution informing these new relationships you gotta find out who's who you want to

995
01:48:20.44 --> 01:48:29.88
establish things but again you gotta watch out because people might not necessarily be who they

996
01:48:29.88 --> 01:48:36.60
make themselves out to be in the beginning so this is kind of becoming a little bit of a chorus

997
01:48:36.60 --> 01:48:44.92
when I talk about leading be humble listen learn move methodically when it does come time to

998
01:48:44.92 --> 01:48:55.16
make change in a new situation most of the time I would say do it incrementally do smaller changes

999
01:48:55.16 --> 01:49:01.80
after you've assessed fully and you've got people a people's opinions and you've expressed

1000
01:49:01.80 --> 01:49:07.32
and socialized your ideas so you're not trying to roll in there and change the world again now

1001
01:49:07.32 --> 01:49:12.04
if we go into a hostile turnover situation or there's someone's been fired for cause or that's a

1002
01:49:12.04 --> 01:49:19.88
different situation but for a normal transition into a new job be humble listen learn and lead that part

1003
01:49:19.88 --> 01:49:24.36
where you're you're talking about playing out why they're doing the things that the way they are and

1004
01:49:24.36 --> 01:49:33.72
stuff like that that part can be depending on certain people's personality like if you're coming in

1005
01:49:33.72 --> 01:49:38.68
as the new guy and you and you ask start asking hey why do you guys do it like this if you come off

1006
01:49:38.68 --> 01:49:42.92
with the wrong tone sometimes it'll sound like that you're questioning oh for sure you know so

1007
01:49:42.92 --> 01:49:49.000
sure I remember when I worked at the nightclub we had a new manager and his name was Joel he

1008
01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:57.56
he came in and he was strangely he was this whole list personified he came in is really friendly

1009
01:49:57.56 --> 01:50:02.36
but really reserved but the one thing he did kind of to address what I was talking about right

1010
01:50:02.36 --> 01:50:08.04
really good job he except as no no okay nothing I'm saying an example of how he

1011
01:50:09.80 --> 01:50:14.28
clarified that he's not questioning the way we're doing stuff he's not saying hey where are you doing it like that

1012
01:50:14.28 --> 01:50:20.44
because this way sucks it didn't have that tone but he came for me and I saw him do it to the other guy

1013
01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:26.28
where he he came in and said hey I'm I'm gonna be asking a lot of questions because obviously I'm new here

1014
01:50:26.28 --> 01:50:32.44
you know just so I can understand and and get on board with what you're doing so it can be ultimately

1015
01:50:32.44 --> 01:50:36.60
what we are doing that's what he said he said in a little bit differently obviously but

1016
01:50:38.04 --> 01:50:41.64
that's what he said and that right away so no matter what question he asked it was almost like

1017
01:50:41.64 --> 01:50:45.88
should I want to tell this guy how it's working you know because he's he's he's he's on my team

1018
01:50:45.88 --> 01:50:50.84
automatically told me that and he was on my team so I think if that can be clarified that you're not

1019
01:50:50.84 --> 01:50:56.92
like questioning it because it seems like you know I want to make it seem like you know I know

1020
01:50:56.92 --> 01:51:01.64
a better way right off the bat you don't want that tone you know I know just from on a receiving end

1021
01:51:01.64 --> 01:51:07.80
I don't want that to know because I'm gonna be on yeah so anyway yes yes yes in the last thing I kind of

1022
01:51:07.80 --> 01:51:16.20
had written down here was enjoy it it's it's it's awesome stepping into a new leadership position

1023
01:51:16.20 --> 01:51:22.60
and it's challenging to do what you just talked about to transition people into your leadership

1024
01:51:22.60 --> 01:51:30.12
realm and to do it in a subtle way that brings them on board with a positive attitude so

1025
01:51:30.12 --> 01:51:35.000
enjoy that challenge yeah because it's it's pretty fun it's challenging and most importantly

1026
01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:43.72
it's rewarding yeah next question juggle how do you learn slash practice detachment in real time

1027
01:51:48.28 --> 01:51:55.24
detachment so I this is something that I have talked about a lot and

1028
01:51:55.24 --> 01:52:03.08
it is definitely a very important part of leadership and it's a very important part of

1029
01:52:07.80 --> 01:52:13.72
of finding your way successfully through life it's an important part of navigation

1030
01:52:14.28 --> 01:52:22.84
of the world so and if you haven't heard me talk about this this is the idea that you are not

1031
01:52:22.84 --> 01:52:30.60
caught up in the emotions and the chaos and the and the tactical fire fight that's happening

1032
01:52:30.60 --> 01:52:37.000
you detach so you can make good judgments about things so how do you do it how do you learn it

1033
01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:49.56
now do you practice it step number one is awareness awareness of yourself so you start asking yourself

1034
01:52:49.56 --> 01:52:57.88
how am I being perceived right now if you can just occasionally start asking yourself how am I being

1035
01:52:57.88 --> 01:53:05.72
perceived right now how is echo singing me right now so all the sudden you you start to take other

1036
01:53:05.72 --> 01:53:14.12
people's perspective which is it's a good start because it's not your own and the goal is to

1037
01:53:14.12 --> 01:53:19.88
get outside of your own perspective and see yourself from some kind of a distance so you start

1038
01:53:19.88 --> 01:53:25.80
asking yourself how am I being perceived and then start trying to watch yourself like what do I look

1039
01:53:25.80 --> 01:53:35.24
like right now am I caught inside that madness and once you start to do that that's going to be like

1040
01:53:35.24 --> 01:53:40.04
your that's going to be your little tool that you're going to use is getting outside and just

1041
01:53:40.04 --> 01:53:47.48
watch yourself and saying okay I am aware of what I'm doing right now I am aware of what I am doing

1042
01:53:47.48 --> 01:53:55.72
right now and then what you want to do is you want to set some kind of alerts because you don't

1043
01:53:55.72 --> 01:54:00.12
walk around and walk around detached from myself all the time I'm not I mean otherwise you would have

1044
01:54:00.12 --> 01:54:05.88
no joy and you would have no you'd have no pain you'd have no emotions because you'd be detached from

1045
01:54:05.88 --> 01:54:13.72
so you don't walk I don't walk around just detached all the time but I do have some alerts some

1046
01:54:13.72 --> 01:54:21.32
little red flags and little triggers that happened in my mind that when I feel them I know okay

1047
01:54:22.28 --> 01:54:29.96
you're starting to go too far and you're losing the perception of yourself

1048
01:54:29.96 --> 01:54:38.12
what's your trigger there a couple of them number one is like some strong emotion yeah like

1049
01:54:38.12 --> 01:54:43.16
anger yeah yeah you know anger you start feeling sorry if you start clenching your fist or you

1050
01:54:43.16 --> 01:54:48.68
start raising your voice that should be a warning okay you are not thinking clearly right now

1051
01:54:48.68 --> 01:54:56.84
detached from this get away from these emotions some kind of chaos like chaos happening

1052
01:54:56.84 --> 01:55:02.44
and you're in it whether it's in a supermarket whether it's you know something bad something

1053
01:55:02.44 --> 01:55:07.40
violent something mob if you're getting in that situation you start feeling that

1054
01:55:07.40 --> 01:55:12.28
detach yourself from it because you can get caught up and it's any overwhelming excitement

1055
01:55:13.48 --> 01:55:19.64
will be it now here's a good red flag here's a good red flag good alert

1056
01:55:19.64 --> 01:55:27.72
is the 27th time you bang your head against the wall attacking a problem whatever that problem is

1057
01:55:28.44 --> 01:55:32.04
you know and I actually made this joke the other day of your jiu jiu jiu because we're talking

1058
01:55:32.04 --> 01:55:38.84
about passing someone's guard and people will try and try and try one way one way one way one two three four five

1059
01:55:38.84 --> 01:55:43.56
and I'm like listen after your 27th attempt to pass someone's guard the same way

1060
01:55:43.56 --> 01:55:50.12
go ahead and try another way so this happens a lot where if you find yourself beating your head

1061
01:55:50.12 --> 01:55:57.56
against the wall after the 27th time go ahead and let that be a little alert that you need to

1062
01:55:57.56 --> 01:56:01.56
detach you need to get because there's some reason that you're doing this maybe it's an emotional

1063
01:56:01.56 --> 01:56:07.40
reason maybe it's just your two close to the problem maybe it's that the problem has a

1064
01:56:07.40 --> 01:56:15.72
hold of you and you don't recognize it but let that be in alert a trigger that tells you hey buddy

1065
01:56:15.72 --> 01:56:27.88
detach take a look around and see if there's another way now another huge thing that requires

1066
01:56:27.88 --> 01:56:40.92
detachment is your ego your big nasty powerful ego it's one of the biggest things that you

1067
01:56:40.92 --> 01:56:48.92
have to utilize detachment to overcome and let me tell you some of the things that will warn you

1068
01:56:48.92 --> 01:56:54.20
that your ego is now in the game and when your ego is in the game when your ego is in the game

1069
01:56:54.20 --> 01:57:05.72
it will very easily win it will beat you so when you're feeling jealousy likely that's going to

1070
01:57:05.72 --> 01:57:10.36
be your ego and actually heard somebody on Twitter hit me with this the other day and it was

1071
01:57:10.36 --> 01:57:20.52
something along the lines of if you're feeling jealous instead of saying I'm jealous of this person

1072
01:57:20.52 --> 01:57:27.24
say what can I learn from this person wow great statement right because that's when you set your

1073
01:57:27.24 --> 01:57:33.000
ego that's when you detach from your ego and you say okay I'm not going to be jealous of this person

1074
01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:39.64
they can teach me something when you start feeling frustrated when you start feeling disgust or anger

1075
01:57:39.64 --> 01:57:48.84
where is that emotion coming from very high likelihood it's coming from your ego so you need to

1076
01:57:48.84 --> 01:57:57.32
put that ego into check do you think that's the hardest one do you think oh yeah although

1077
01:58:01.48 --> 01:58:08.92
they can all be pretty hard I mean because you know when you get emotional about a relationship

1078
01:58:08.92 --> 01:58:13.88
yeah I mean that's not always your ego that can be your ego especially if there's another person involved

1079
01:58:13.88 --> 01:58:18.60
right but a lot of times that's not your ego that's that's your emotion that's hurting

1080
01:58:18.60 --> 01:58:27.80
and causing problems but yeah the ego I actually find the ego because it's so clear it's so

1081
01:58:27.80 --> 01:58:34.44
clear that you're just being an idiot with your ego I always go God I'm stupid why am I doing this

1082
01:58:37.16 --> 01:58:41.56
and I think it is usually pretty I think the ones that are harder a little bit a little bit more

1083
01:58:41.56 --> 01:58:47.88
subtle you know yeah yeah and that's kind of what I mean because the ego is like that's how powerful it

1084
01:58:47.88 --> 01:58:55.000
is because any extreme situation or extreme example of any one of these like you can feel it really

1085
01:58:55.000 --> 01:59:00.12
angry it's easy to see I lost my temper right there I'm just an ad on that shouldn't it yelled at

1086
01:59:00.12 --> 01:59:08.28
you know whatever or if your ego's prevalent in this really just to end it real strong way it's

1087
01:59:08.28 --> 01:59:14.84
obvious and of course not but the ego I feel like it's like that subtlety of it makes it hard

1088
01:59:14.84 --> 01:59:19.40
because you know that last part of it's like if you want to remove your ego it's almost like a

1089
01:59:19.40 --> 01:59:24.36
bucket of sand where you gotta get the last corner of your ego out for it to work otherwise

1090
01:59:24.36 --> 01:59:29.08
your ego still in the game no you know it was always in the game and and I don't encourage people

1091
01:59:29.08 --> 01:59:33.48
to I'm not like the boot of it says completely a limited your ego because your ego is what's

1092
01:59:33.48 --> 01:59:38.44
driving you in many cases to perform well to win there's nothing wrong with that you know and if

1093
01:59:38.44 --> 01:59:47.88
you but the part of the end of in the end of what's that book anyways just like ego is this

1094
01:59:49.16 --> 01:59:55.48
God bless the ego you know this and it's pretty powerful because that's what drives you that's the

1095
01:59:55.48 --> 02:00:03.000
individual effort the problem is there's a dichotomy of everything and sometimes your ego will

1096
02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:06.60
get the best of you and that's what you need to watch out for and that's when you get a learn to

1097
02:00:06.60 --> 02:00:13.24
attach from it yeah so it's like each situation you have a certain sized cup that can only hold

1098
02:00:13.24 --> 02:00:19.64
so much ego to get it done and then any even one drop it's gonna jam you up if it's one

1099
02:00:19.64 --> 02:00:23.72
if you're one drop overflowing you know and you could make bad decisions with your ego yeah

1100
02:00:23.72 --> 02:00:27.96
if you let it get in the way yeah and that's the hard thing because and I think that's probably

1101
02:00:27.96 --> 02:00:34.04
the reason because you need your ego to kind of function and get test done and excel and all this

1102
02:00:34.04 --> 02:00:40.20
stuff so you have to basically find that fine line that you have to get rid of you know the

1103
02:00:40.20 --> 02:00:47.000
the at that what point do you get rid of enough ego to still have enough ego to get the test done you

1104
02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:53.72
know so the dichotomy yeah sometimes you're gonna be like yeah not that I ever have that problem

1105
02:00:53.72 --> 02:00:58.04
nothing like that you're just saying it it's seen like you know or that problem unfortunately

1106
02:00:58.04 --> 02:01:09.32
okay juggle what do you think of people in leadership rules who cuss I see it in coaching

1107
02:01:10.12 --> 02:01:18.12
guys either totally use it or totally against it so swearing

1108
02:01:18.12 --> 02:01:28.60
and crossing using foul language I think this is a pretty straightforward question I can tell you

1109
02:01:28.60 --> 02:01:39.72
that by no means am i a saint and and you know I was in those seal teams for 20 years

1110
02:01:39.72 --> 02:01:44.52
and when you've heard the term swear like a sailor there's actually a level beyond that

1111
02:01:44.52 --> 02:01:50.92
and that's swearing like a seal and so I you know there's times in the seal teams where

1112
02:01:50.92 --> 02:01:58.28
literally you know every single word in a sentence would be you know a swear word

1113
02:02:00.68 --> 02:02:05.40
and and that's something that when I go back and brief the tea brief the seal teams right now

1114
02:02:05.40 --> 02:02:12.04
on something I go almost right back into that mode you know not not quite as bad as I would

1115
02:02:12.04 --> 02:02:21.08
probably was at the high point of my career where I was well rehearsed and well trained at

1116
02:02:21.08 --> 02:02:26.28
foul language but uh but hey here's the deal on a forum like this where we're on a podcast where

1117
02:02:26.28 --> 02:02:38.68
you know many many people listen to this including kids and my kids and um I try and utilize

1118
02:02:38.68 --> 02:02:45.16
better language now and I'll tell you what I actually had a point where I sort of said to myself

1119
02:02:45.72 --> 02:02:50.36
me I'm not gonna do that and I heard a podcast but you're not gonna do what I'm not gonna swear

1120
02:02:50.36 --> 02:02:54.68
a lot I'm not gonna be in I'm not just gonna swear the whole time in the podcast and this

1121
02:02:54.68 --> 02:03:00.12
actually happened because I heard a podcast I listened to a podcast where it was actually it was

1122
02:03:00.84 --> 02:03:05.56
a conversation you know normal podcast there was a conversation going on between two people and

1123
02:03:05.56 --> 02:03:14.20
there were swearing so much that I just said to myself man this sounds ridiculous they just

1124
02:03:14.20 --> 02:03:21.08
sounded it sounded completely ridiculous and I just decided after and this was before we started

1125
02:03:21.08 --> 02:03:25.08
up I this was you know maybe like two years ago I mean it was a long time ago I heard this podcast

1126
02:03:25.08 --> 02:03:32.28
I just said to myself and these people sound stupid with so much swearing and um and it wasn't

1127
02:03:32.28 --> 02:03:37.80
the thing is like you listen to Joe Rogan or like a comedic podcast and they're swearing and

1128
02:03:37.80 --> 02:03:44.84
and some people like friends and Joe Rogan he swears he does it at the right time and it has

1129
02:03:44.84 --> 02:03:50.84
comedic impact or it has value when he does it so so that's understandable but I've heard people

1130
02:03:50.84 --> 02:03:57.48
that they just it's it's just it doesn't it ends up having no impact other than just to make you

1131
02:03:57.48 --> 02:04:03.40
say this person's not very smart right so with that you know I just try to keep it clean

1132
02:04:04.52 --> 02:04:08.76
actually it's not even almost like I don't consciously sit there and try and keep it clean but

1133
02:04:10.36 --> 02:04:16.52
you know I try and keep it clean yeah is that kind of like you know people most of us have this

1134
02:04:17.80 --> 02:04:22.44
I don't say problem but we always say like like you know like very similar like how it just did

1135
02:04:22.44 --> 02:04:27.88
yes and I'm doing that it's still kind of like that yeah it is it's the same thing where when you

1136
02:04:27.88 --> 02:04:36.36
hear someone saying like like like it's soon as you you might not even recognize it at first

1137
02:04:36.36 --> 02:04:41.56
because we're so used to hearing it yeah but if you pick up on it and you're listening to a podcast

1138
02:04:41.56 --> 02:04:48.12
and you start to hear someone do that it's the same thing you just say wow this person really sounds

1139
02:04:48.12 --> 02:04:56.84
stupid and they might be smart but this person sounds really stupid and I'm not gonna sound like that

1140
02:04:58.44 --> 02:05:05.72
so that's pretty much where where my opinion comes from and why and if you know when I have

1141
02:05:05.72 --> 02:05:10.36
had a couple people hit me up and say you know hey this is the only podcast that I listen to that my

1142
02:05:10.36 --> 02:05:15.000
kids can listen to yeah and that's that's kind of cool you know I appreciate that it's it's pretty

1143
02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:22.20
it's pretty humbling to hear that people are you know sitting there listening to podcasts with

1144
02:05:22.20 --> 02:05:28.04
their kids yeah and I guess humbling is the wrong word which somebody hit me up on Twitter it's an

1145
02:05:28.04 --> 02:05:35.08
honor right and it's an honor that doesn't feel like I deserve but it's an honor here somebody's

1146
02:05:35.08 --> 02:05:38.68
sitting around and say oh you know I listen to this podcast with my daughter or I listen to your

1147
02:05:38.68 --> 02:05:42.60
podcast with my son and it's so many good lessons to learn and that that feels pretty good yeah

1148
02:05:42.60 --> 02:05:49.56
yeah and so if I was to throw that out the window so that I could drop some F-bombs yeah

1149
02:05:49.56 --> 02:05:56.84
doesn't really seem worth it because what kind of a linguistic command do I have if the only

1150
02:05:56.84 --> 02:06:04.12
way I can get my point across is by is by using foul language you know if the funny thing is too is

1151
02:06:05.000 --> 02:06:11.40
well I used to go you know when I was in the SEAL teams I would go and literally like I said

1152
02:06:11.40 --> 02:06:18.52
my I would have whole sentence construction that would be nothing but F-bombs right and I would

1153
02:06:18.52 --> 02:06:24.20
come home and in front of my six six year old kid or whatever I never sworn in front of my kids

1154
02:06:25.08 --> 02:06:31.000
and people would be kind of surprised like if I had a seal buddy over and they'd hear me talk

1155
02:06:31.000 --> 02:06:35.48
in my house and they'd say how do you even do that how do you and I don't know why I've just been

1156
02:06:35.48 --> 02:06:41.16
able to do it so that was another thing you know these podcasts when you go on the interwebs

1157
02:06:41.16 --> 02:06:48.12
they're there for I hate to say it but they're there forever you know and you can take them down

1158
02:06:48.12 --> 02:06:54.92
but these are going to be these are out there so if you if you want to be represented that way

1159
02:06:55.80 --> 02:07:02.60
for the rest of your life then you had to be a little bit careful about what you're saying

1160
02:07:02.60 --> 02:07:11.08
yeah yeah that's um because I kind of like it's not like too swear but I like when

1161
02:07:11.08 --> 02:07:15.72
people swear and stuff I think it's but just like how you were saying like for example Joe Rogan like

1162
02:07:15.72 --> 02:07:19.72
he'll swear and sometimes it'll swear a lot but it's perfect isn't it's funny when it needs to be

1163
02:07:19.72 --> 02:07:25.24
funny it emphasizes you know a certain emotion when it needs it's it's perfect and that's kind of

1164
02:07:25.24 --> 02:07:31.000
the reason why I like it because sometimes it can be really funny it can be fun to do but overall

1165
02:07:31.72 --> 02:07:36.12
there's a certain kind of you can't help but kind of respect someone who doesn't like

1166
02:07:36.12 --> 02:07:42.68
use the word like all the time or that doesn't say um all the time or who doesn't say you know

1167
02:07:42.68 --> 02:07:48.44
all the time or no I'm saying or whatever and and can can control that and I think swearing is yet

1168
02:07:48.44 --> 02:07:53.32
another one of those things that some people it's more of a weakness where they kind of they don't

1169
02:07:53.32 --> 02:07:56.92
don't know how to use it right they just swear because they swear and you know my parents were

1170
02:07:56.92 --> 02:08:03.48
so I swear who cares kind of thing and on top of that you do have to consider who you're talking to

1171
02:08:03.48 --> 02:08:06.52
and in a podcast situation you're essentially talking to everybody regardless of the

1172
02:08:06.52 --> 02:08:11.16
you you're trying to talk to who you think or want your audience to be it's everyone and anyone who

1173
02:08:11.16 --> 02:08:16.60
presses the button is going to be listening so if you don't care how you come off then good didn't that's

1174
02:08:16.60 --> 02:08:22.12
that's great but I think you do have more of a control on how you come off when you can control

1175
02:08:22.12 --> 02:08:27.08
how much you swear it don't swear well I haven't had anybody you know hit me up on Twitter and say

1176
02:08:27.08 --> 02:08:32.52
hey you really need to swear on mom right it doesn't happen didn't know one said hey you need to say

1177
02:08:32.52 --> 02:08:38.12
um or or you need to say like more people don't need to hear that they accept it because

1178
02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:44.44
it's there and I'll tell you a funny the first time I took my just to take my son out occasionally

1179
02:08:44.44 --> 02:08:53.08
to various seal training sites you know in order to unoccupate him to violence and fire arms

1180
02:08:53.08 --> 02:09:00.84
and machine guns and war and and yes you people can all call child services on me

1181
02:09:00.84 --> 02:09:08.20
but it was funny the first time you know he watched a single-polled tune do some event

1182
02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:15.72
and I think he was at a out of urban training facility and they got done and I was debriefing

1183
02:09:15.72 --> 02:09:22.68
them and you know this is my son who had never heard me swear and you kind of used at that age where

1184
02:09:22.68 --> 02:09:29.72
you know a swear word was like it was worse than ever and he you know he was standing there and I debriefed these

1185
02:09:29.72 --> 02:09:38.04
guys and I debriefed them in the proper seal technique and I got done he had a look at his face

1186
02:09:38.04 --> 02:09:47.24
that said wow this guy is a little bit different than what I knew it was pretty shocked and it was

1187
02:09:47.24 --> 02:09:51.40
uh it was a pretty funny scenario so you know he say you don't swear in front of your kids um

1188
02:09:51.40 --> 02:09:59.72
um why is that because you don't want them to swear or or yeah I mean there is you know if

1189
02:09:59.72 --> 02:10:06.12
you ever see a and and I do now that my daughters are a little older I'll drop some swear words

1190
02:10:06.12 --> 02:10:14.36
and I'm in occasionally for impact or for humor you know or for whatever so so I will do it but

1191
02:10:14.36 --> 02:10:25.56
if you ever see a young girl swearing you see a young boy you know it very much seems

1192
02:10:26.76 --> 02:10:35.72
disrespectful in my opinion so I don't want my kids to be running around with a foul mouth

1193
02:10:36.92 --> 02:10:41.40
now I took my son and a couple of his buddies went a little surf trip and they were sleeping in a

1194
02:10:41.40 --> 02:10:50.36
tent outside of and I was in the I was in the camper and I woke up at when I normally wake up and

1195
02:10:50.36 --> 02:10:54.20
they were what they were up early to go surfing as well but I was standing outside their tent and I was

1196
02:10:54.20 --> 02:10:59.48
pretty impressed with you. Oh you're the wife you're ready a foul language that they produced.

1197
02:10:59.48 --> 02:11:05.56
Yeah yeah and that's kind of a thing too right so it doesn't if you'd never swear to your kids it's

1198
02:11:05.56 --> 02:11:11.16
not like you have protected them for swearing so that's that's my point is that after I stood

1199
02:11:11.16 --> 02:11:15.16
out there for a while and I listened to them and then I said something along the lines of

1200
02:11:15.48 --> 02:11:21.96
hey are you guys done and are you ready to surfing and my son says how long have you been out there

1201
02:11:21.96 --> 02:11:29.48
dad and and I swore back at him I swore back at him and said I've been out here long and then

1202
02:11:29.48 --> 02:11:34.76
they kind of remain quiet for a second and then they started laughing I said all right boys let's go so

1203
02:11:34.76 --> 02:11:40.84
I'm not a goodie to choose I understand and you know we talked about Pat and Patton swore.

1204
02:11:42.20 --> 02:11:47.48
Incessantly amongst the troops and then when he'd get in front of the politicians he would not and I guess

1205
02:11:48.36 --> 02:11:54.20
I would hope to behave that way and I just got too I used to go there was when we got back

1206
02:11:54.20 --> 02:11:59.32
for a money I had to go and brief the secretary of the navy I had to go brief the congrent

1207
02:11:59.96 --> 02:12:04.52
joint caucus I mean I had to go and brief some high level governmental officials and whatnot

1208
02:12:04.52 --> 02:12:09.40
and I was just walking there or not obviously you're not going to swear for them so I think that's another

1209
02:12:10.52 --> 02:12:17.80
another situation where you've got to know and understand when to swear and when not to swear and

1210
02:12:18.44 --> 02:12:24.36
I just hopefully I'm making the right decisions and like I said no one has no one has

1211
02:12:25.64 --> 02:12:31.32
hit me up and said you really need to use more foul language and you know there's times where we've you know

1212
02:12:31.32 --> 02:12:38.12
we've used foul language on the podcast because hey it's a reality it's a reality of

1213
02:12:38.92 --> 02:12:47.40
Vietnam it's a reality of all wars yeah so to exclude it like it doesn't exist is not what I'm trying to do here

1214
02:12:47.40 --> 02:12:53.24
Yeah and that's kind of a big in my opinion a big deal when someone you can tell they're

1215
02:12:53.24 --> 02:13:00.60
they're actively pursuing not swearing where in any kind of especially in a casual conversation where

1216
02:13:00.60 --> 02:13:07.000
they're about to say something and then they then they use like I don't know sugar I don't know

1217
02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:12.12
you know those reap obvious replays and which is it's nothing wrong with it but it does kind of

1218
02:13:12.12 --> 02:13:16.44
kind of make you think oh wait like we so we can't just be ourselves right now like we I don't know

1219
02:13:16.44 --> 02:13:21.32
it feels like you may feel free to relate to it yeah you know what's interesting is you see

1220
02:13:21.32 --> 02:13:30.20
full metal jacket and just an amazing movie about the Marine Corps and the whole the whole first 45 minutes is boot camp

1221
02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:37.16
and it's played by Lee Raymy I think is his name and he does he was a real general instructor and so he just

1222
02:13:37.16 --> 02:13:42.92
nails it and I remember when my son was six or seven years old I thought to myself I'll play him some of

1223
02:13:42.92 --> 02:13:47.96
this movie I'll just find some parts that don't have any foul language there are no parts well

1224
02:13:47.96 --> 02:13:57.48
everything is just completely over the top and it's awesome so so there's definitely a time in a

1225
02:13:57.48 --> 02:14:04.20
place where the other thing is for me honestly it's you know I was I'm always trying to do better

1226
02:14:04.20 --> 02:14:13.48
it stuff there's a challenge be in trying to find words that are gonna have impact without just

1227
02:14:13.48 --> 02:14:19.08
going right to the easy button on the on the big f-bomb because that's gonna have impact but

1228
02:14:19.08 --> 02:14:24.04
if that's what you need to use then that's just a little easy out that I want to take every single

1229
02:14:24.04 --> 02:14:29.32
time and presents itself yeah I'll tell you when I get when there's been a couple times with my

1230
02:14:29.32 --> 02:14:36.92
kids where they've stepped over line there's something out of line and when I when I've sworn at them

1231
02:14:36.92 --> 02:14:41.48
it was like I slapped him in the face because it was having that much impact when I was just

1232
02:14:41.48 --> 02:14:45.56
thrown around all the time it's taken away the impact right right yeah so strategically it's

1233
02:14:45.56 --> 02:14:52.44
a secret yeah patting apparently was from what I read he he when he'd get people fired up he

1234
02:14:52.44 --> 02:14:56.12
do that on purpose oh and then like even just in normal conversation he didn't really swear that

1235
02:14:56.12 --> 02:15:00.76
much this one thing so he used it as a specific tool you know to get certain things done

1236
02:15:00.76 --> 02:15:06.28
it's for as influence goes yeah I can't believe we've talked for 10 minutes about swearing right

1237
02:15:06.28 --> 02:15:12.44
it needed to be talked about anyway that's the question I think we got time for one more

1238
02:15:13.96 --> 02:15:22.28
okay last question juggle what techniques do you use to deal with situational stress from battlefield

1239
02:15:22.28 --> 02:15:30.84
to boardroom well first of all and I don't mean to minimize the stress that people face but

1240
02:15:30.84 --> 02:15:38.36
imagine imagine what Eugene sledge that we talked about tonight imagine what he went through on

1241
02:15:38.36 --> 02:15:48.04
pellelu in the tens of thousands of marines that suffered debt unimaginable horror

1242
02:15:50.44 --> 02:15:56.20
and then you imagine hackworth who he talked about here who wrote about face assaulting enemy

1243
02:15:56.20 --> 02:16:03.08
positions in korean he was wounded over and over again on the line and still went back for more

1244
02:16:05.80 --> 02:16:17.88
and he got Alan Seeger the poet who in World War I went over the top over and over again

1245
02:16:17.88 --> 02:16:28.44
to make his rendezvous with death and there's been thousands and hundreds of thousands of millions

1246
02:16:28.44 --> 02:16:37.40
of warriors that have been in very stressful situations and faced evil and faced death

1247
02:16:38.36 --> 02:16:47.80
much worse than the situation I'm in or urine that we might consider stressful and

1248
02:16:47.80 --> 02:16:51.80
I even did this when I was overseas when I was on deployment when I was a combat leader

1249
02:16:53.48 --> 02:16:59.80
I was feeling stress and you know what we took casualties and it was awful and it was heartbreaking

1250
02:17:05.000 --> 02:17:13.48
but there were other soldiers and warriors throughout time that had been in much worse situations

1251
02:17:13.48 --> 02:17:25.08
getty's burger, vix burger, the battle the bulge and in all those horrible situations

1252
02:17:26.84 --> 02:17:33.64
they prove really that humans can withstand almost unimaginable stress

1253
02:17:33.64 --> 02:17:46.92
which meant to me that I could too and you can and the first step for me is doing that taking that

1254
02:17:48.44 --> 02:17:56.36
look to gain some perspective and then in order to gain perspective you got to do something

1255
02:17:56.36 --> 02:18:01.40
that we already talked about you got to detach you've got to detach from the problems or the

1256
02:18:01.40 --> 02:18:07.56
stress that you're experiencing so that you can get that perspective of them

1257
02:18:09.80 --> 02:18:18.12
now there's a couple different types of stress now if it's something that you can control

1258
02:18:18.12 --> 02:18:25.64
that's causing you stress well why aren't you getting control of it generally it's a lack of

1259
02:18:25.64 --> 02:18:32.60
discipline so you've got to have the discipline to grab control and make it happen and when I say

1260
02:18:32.60 --> 02:18:40.68
you need discipline for that what that means is these stresses that you're avoiding they're not

1261
02:18:40.68 --> 02:18:47.80
going to go away if you avoid them so take the discipline to face the stressful situation get ahead of

1262
02:18:47.80 --> 02:18:55.40
it don't be afraid of it now there's also stress that's caused by things that you cannot

1263
02:18:55.40 --> 02:19:04.36
control and if you remember talking earlier about artillery and how horrible that was and what made

1264
02:19:04.36 --> 02:19:12.60
it so horrible was that there's no control over so if you can't control something and you can't get

1265
02:19:12.60 --> 02:19:22.44
control of it you have to at least embrace what you can and I'm not saying you're going to embrace

1266
02:19:22.44 --> 02:19:29.24
artillery showing but I'll tell you what when it comes to things like artillery or for us in

1267
02:19:29.24 --> 02:19:36.68
Ramadi was IEDs and we could do everything we could do to mitigate that risk but eventually

1268
02:19:36.68 --> 02:19:43.32
there's only so much you can do and you cannot completely eliminate it but you can't control it so

1269
02:19:43.32 --> 02:19:49.16
why you're going to worry about it why you're going to stress about it if there's something that's

1270
02:19:49.16 --> 02:19:55.72
completely beyond your control you cannot you've got to detach from it and not let yourself

1271
02:19:55.72 --> 02:20:04.76
get stressed about it and on top of that if it's something that you can't control how can you

1272
02:20:04.76 --> 02:20:09.80
look at it in a different light how can you see it in a way that you could actually take advantage of it

1273
02:20:09.80 --> 02:20:23.08
how can you take that stress and make it into some kind of ally you know the chaos of combat

1274
02:20:23.08 --> 02:20:27.56
is something that I couldn't control but I had to embrace it so I could try and figure out how to

1275
02:20:27.56 --> 02:20:39.72
take advantage of it so when it comes to stress don't fight it turn it on itself and you

1276
02:20:39.72 --> 02:20:48.12
use it use it to make yourself sharper and more alert and use it to make yourself think more

1277
02:20:48.12 --> 02:20:58.60
and learn more and get better and use that stress as a catalyst to make yourself better

1278
02:20:58.60 --> 02:21:11.40
and I think that's all we've got for tonight so thanks to everybody for tuning in and listening to us
