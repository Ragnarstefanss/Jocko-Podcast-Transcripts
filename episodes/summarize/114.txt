Yeah, so running a ground is one thing the You know, and there's an argument to be said like because some of our greatest leaders like Admiral fleet Admiral Chester Nimitz who was the hero the Pacific war was off-court to him You know on this on this podcast previously He was the commander chief of all US forces in the Pacific so he was he was the the the person Responsible for the entire war effort against the Japanese in World War II and that victory A massive effort obviously in an extraordinary turnaround From from this assur to to victory He actually ran a ship a ground as as a junior officer, so so there's you know There's an argument to be made that there is no full you know the flawless performance it doesn't exist and people make mistakes You can learn from it, you know as far as ships running around You know that that's one thing. That's a problem When you're not detached you don't even know you're not detached you're in the storm and you don't even know it That's a lot of stuff for that's exactly right, but I think you know for people it maybe don't fully understand what that means Right this this idea of the tax which you've obviously talked a lot about on here and which is such a key thing for decision making it's The I think the key thing there is is to make sure that that you're not you're not clouded by You know this emotional attachment to plans which we often talk about with our Ladies and the seal teams like I'm emotionally invested in a plan that I came up with I spent hours or days or weeks or months you know involved in I was like we designed our own patches were like where do you say we patch me and the Delta Potent Commander We me and the Delta Potent Commander said we're gonna design some batches for testing in a bruiser and I don't know I don't know why if we just had an idea that this was gonna be a historic unit This was gonna be something we wanted to be a part of but we felt like we needed Tasking the patch and I felt like you secretly wanted us to have them even though you told us not to do it So I think You know if you're in that stage and you're you're a wild teen You need to think clearly about the long-term consequences Because you definitely can pay the man now and pay later in that situation for sure one of the things that we do is as Young boys and speaking from a boy perspective because I'm not a girl and when I was growing up and with the way I look back on it now a lot of the stuff that we did dumb stuff that we did as teenagers was We were testing each other and we were trying to prove ourselves back on on top watch me do this like on it's almost it's almost like if you go Instinctually as a tribe member You're proving that you're willing to sacrifice you're willing to take risk and sacrifice That's what you're proving to your peers like I'm gonna like what you just said pick up truck I'm gonna drive down the road but it's it's when you're that amped up your chances of of getting injured or Wayward just more significant and it's why you know if you see a brand new white belt come with I'm much rather roll with brown belt and Perfect blue even though I know they're gonna you know they're gonna get the best of me I have a much less chance of getting injured than just the death match with some white belt who's you know Who doesn't even know you know anything We're gonna make a good this is the bait the fundamentally we're gonna make a good first impression We're gonna look square to weigh which means we're gonna You know have square to weigh here cuts we're gonna blouse our boots and we're gonna wear a Normal looking uniform which means we don't have crazy looking patches that that Make us look different right cuz that's the thing that you're saying the thing you're saying is look at me. Yep, and playing the game as well right that I'm gonna buck authority of like you know what actually it's gonna be a lot worse for you If you just you know even from a just personal perspective not knowing worse for you, but you're for your squad or for your You know these folks that you care about if you just build a better relationship with the folks above you and set of being the You know hard headed argumentative guy for sure It would be way better for me. or You know like you have a specific question like hey that was cool what you just said but what about you know like some people have questions So during the break When most times like at these conventions or whatever they got the you know the people they'll they'll say they're what they have to send But like we say in the in the in the Navy all the time You know perception is reality that becomes reality so you've got to you got to you can defeat the gossip and rumors by actually Just sharing the truth be open with people and and and and being first out there with the message So people get an understanding and even when horrible bad things go wrong Extreme ownership right if if you take ownership for that and say hey listen this happened here's what we're doing to fix it here's what we're doing in turn things around It's kind of People people people are not gonna lose respect for you in the organization They're actually gonna gain respect for years results. I mean it is is And at one point I'm like laughing him because he's literally like You know that kind of breathing like Dave in his Like you know when you breathe when you feel here somebody breathing hard like that typically it's like when you're they're writing your ear I mean, I think Just like any just like our combat experience we would adapt to the battlefield We learned we educated ourselves about things that we didn't know about and and and we've grown I mean, I don't think anyone could I don't know if we could have predicted just how you know widely disseminated the book would be or Or you know the popular things that we're talking about We knew they were powerful it's a whole reason we wrote the book. That's where you know like as a new beginner white belt to whatever I'm gonna come in and then just get insulted by and know it all the whatever like I don't know even though if I like you Jitsu now yeah kind of things and you run there. but but if you've got you got the right team in place They know what they're doing you know that there's all kinds of safe safeguards in place and if that team's properly trained like that Should not happen it should not it's like you should be able the airplane should land safely all the horrible things It could go wrong when you're flying in near plane and landing in a crazy airport like JFK or you know our LX I think the other thing to is you know do everything you can to take care of that that person and their family Take care of their family and and help them out and you know that's an obligation that never goes away That you're always gonna have and that's extremely important and something that's that's helped me through you know Those difficult losses is by serving others and looking trying to look out for others and I got to do that even more than I do You know another thing that can help out In those dark times is a little bit of jiu-jitsu to be quite frank with you next questions about jiu-jitsu again That's what it's gonna do Not only what you should think about in a section called thoughts, but all of the actions you should take if you Want to proceed to get stronger Faster smarter and all around better and if you want the audio version don't look for it on audible because it's not there This is an Album also with tracks and it's available in MP3 format From Amazon music from Google play from other MP3 platforms And actually life, let's talk a little bit about I don't know a couple books we wrote a little company we got maybe a little event that we're doing First of all most if you want a dive deeper in the leadership principles that we've been talking about and referencing getting extreme ownership That's we have people ask us like hey, where did you make mistakes in your career? I mean, a couple of disagreements that came up, you know, for me, something that we taught at all the time, you know, with our business as long front, when we were talking to companies and leadership teams, going to the work of cycle, you know, we always talk about people want to hire folks and just kind of let them run and, you know, people want to say, hey, give them, give them the opportunity to go out and succeed. Shut up according to jockel yelling, but if you're you know how like you're talking like you know You know, it's like it's kind of like you're explained Practically oh some red flags are going off red flags Are those things that as you talked about often you recognize In yourself like okay, I'm getting spun up right now I need to take a step back here and and and throttle back I knew throttle back or because I'm getting spun up so so with kids I got a look at it as you know what this is good Because because I know that some of it's in my nature that I can get spun up so with kids I got to relish that opportunity to say this is a training opportunity for me to be outside my comfort zone to say you know what I feel myself getting spun up. It's a great tool there really for me I think what the when Jocco would sense that in me and we talked about a number of times when that's happened here on the podcast That I was getting spun up, you know, we talked about you know previous In previous podcast about cancel the hop at some of these things where I you know, I just I would get fired really and get angry and and you What most people would have done that situation what I probably would have done to a subordinate leader is get is Get spun up as well and like you yell at me now I'm gonna yell at you, but a little bit louder exactly Yeah, you know I'm not the thing that would work but it would only work like a few times after while it's kind of like You know, you know, it's like cool Life gets it, but We're not all jacco when someone says like or is it know it all and I'm supposed to trust this person to teach me Jiu Jitsu because you know for all the great reasons we take Jiu Jitsu and I'm trusting this person and They're gonna be like how this guy explained I don't know man. I can see that they're like all this is going on and I'm gonna I'm gonna like You know what I'm saying like you think you could have been you could have had that no question about Yeah, a little bit of you know a little bit of anger about that one right there just because they got good grades You know God they really think God Correctors there can be a charge me listen there there are some resentful this is new lay if I just met a new lay for resentful lay I'm actually not at all resentful I I Can tell you I had some I had some good friends who were in those positions and it was great for them, you know good for them So it was it was interesting people were a lot different than I expected and and some folks didn't quite have the The war like mentality that that I expected everyone might have You know going into that environment, but there's no question that if I did done a better job of You know you caught playing playing the game just seeing that you know detaching and seeing like hey Listen thinking strategically. So you might want to just show a little diminished reflection of the part of you know if someone's really sad about something Okay, you know you can't just be like hey, it's not that big of a deal like you know I got It's like it's like learning a Jitsu move from One person and they teach you a fundamental basic move and you're like okay understand that and then Compared to okay now you're gonna get a private lesson like that's like in a class, right? and I got I got really lucky because We got right into this and you you the same thing like we we went right into a new mission and so any time to kind of Wander round and look around and figure out which direction to go and by the way When you're wandering on and looking around to find out which direction to go You're gonna get pulled into the direction and that direction is probably gonna be the path of least resistance. And one of those times in particular was when I was, you know, when I was trying to get, get, I remember a number of times, I want to amount out at, and our, our desert training facility, out at what we call land warfare, and I'm trying to get the Patoon, to pull back to position and we're trying to, trying to patrol out and you gave me, you told me to actually, you know, stop trying to put, put a bunch of detail information out of the radio, like use verbal commands, do it this way, and I, you know, immediately, my ego getting the way I was in, it was frustrating because the team wasn't doing what I wanted to do. But you're still getting the information then okay, you know and also just like Um, with Jordan Peterson like it pays off in life to have thick skin like you're gonna be successful like that's one of the ingredients for For success they dig it Two questions there I think how you manage the ups and downs is is You got to stay focused on what the goal is You know, and I think we talk about that how the recognition You know when we came back from that deployment and you put that slide together about the battle of everybody They kind of capture on this map, you know the the the areas that we'd taken back and even though I'd planned and led those operations You know so many of those operations. Yeah, like you can go through the motions You can't be like hey, I'm gonna detach from detach right now meanwhile you're just like I said clouded by the emotional part that you're like kind of one foot it So I'm gonna I'm gonna ask jockel what is just what is he think right as you're asking him you're like, oh, I know what he's gonna say Sure like I'll be like like he'd be a man if I I think they learn some little move and they're like I throw this a jockel at the right time I feel this at this black belt the right time. It's it's kind of a specific type of person to roll it that will increase your chance of injury and that's like a guy who's strong Mayor may not have like this eagle word you can't talk me and I'm gonna try to keep every single time for sure and He has like an element of like Legitimate strength and athleticism on top of it. It's an interesting when you work we work with leaders sometimes not you see people like I don't want to share this with my people You know because I don't know what they might think like they're they're thinking You're gonna be right right in your comfort zone I'm getting flanked All right Moving on those are the three questions about the monster, but they got asked so here Knowing what you know about war and the teams if you could go back in time what would you have done differently Man, I wish I could go back in time Day Birken hour doing an event Early this week and He was he he said you know, I'm glad I'm not a Romadi. that's how you win check Tell us about a time you were annoyed with jocco or his intensity annoyed with jocco or his intensity You know what we we got along pretty damn well together and and I think There's not there's not really any time that comes to mind that I was annoyed by you Except for maybe you know what what we mentioned earlier right when the times when initially we're working together and you're looking over my shoulder And and tell me to do like we should do this way. You know talking about this head count thing it's it's a great example I'm surprised I haven't talked about it very much because it's a it's a really big deal like Friends and when you leave a target you can't leave until you know that you have all your guys So you got to get a head count there's multiple different ways to get a head count and The easiest way is you use decentralized command and every little team leader counts there three or four guys But they can say focus on that that that go You also got to remember what it feels like to do the right thing It for me like I know what it feels like to not do the right thing and You know the sales leaders said you know I don't I don't want to stoop to their level You know and and start throwing lies out there about them or making accusations I think that's you know you know Some people were a little more academic or wanted to be on the intelligence side or wanted to be You know that they wanted to drive a ship or they wanted to be on a submarine or that you know They those things that you know fly a plane. It's all the thing about that is is we see so many leaders and some of the most successful people We do that recognize how important that is to build relationships and they're they're willing to to lose a sale or we are lose a You know to to send someone to a competitor just to just to make sure that person gets exactly what they need and their Build-in relationship so that means more business gets sent to them as it was what you started on the time It's a strategic win as opposed to a tactical win and that and that's what you've got to be focused on and that's really as a leader That's what you got to be looking at you got to be looking at your front line people and making sure that they they're not just out there Trying to win every little tactical battle, but they're going backwards strategically So keep that in mind. He treats people like crap But he's got really good information and he's you're learning a lot and you so you're gonna take as much knowledge as I can from that person I'm not just gonna walk away because I don't like his attitude. You know what you're gonna have people that you work for That have bad attitudes and you're gonna have people that work for you that have bad attitudes You're gonna have to learn to deal with it. There's 400 something hours of us talking about this kind of thing so you can do that Like I said Wait if you can come to the master that's when you're gonna get basically a private jujitsu lesson You're gonna learn really granular things you're gonna get the interaction face to face I'm like you know when you see me post a Picture in the morning that it say I'm gonna get up but I'm knocking up at 430 If it says 435 that means I got up at 430 you know got out of bed He didn't want to share with the key leaders that they were there were haven't has haven't some issues Having some dire strengths wonder you know get into a point where they're wondering hey I don't know if we're gonna make payroll You know a few months from now if we don't turn these things around I'm sitting there learning because you got like I said You got a firefighter that's explaining to a CEO what you do in a situation where your team has Decided that they're not gonna fall this procedure anymore and they have good reason why they don't want to Like it's one thing when you're when your team doesn't fall the procedure You know, are they they just got put in this in this position of greater responsibility and and authority On their teams are they've been recognized for their exceptional performance or the folks who've come Come back from that and we hear about on a social media or reach out to us via email or come back to a monster Talk about that from what they you know what would it happen to them previously the number of leaders who Come and and see what we're doing and bring their teams, you know, that's what's pretty awesome so so I think you you got to make sure you see a red flag at somebody else They're getting spun up and they're really emotional you need to be unemotional and you need to you need to check your ego to To do an end around I'd never see anybody do that before you did exceptionally well Against me and and I learned a lot from that because I recognize like I got to do that better I didn't never it just doesn't benefit you from getting spun up and angry and and I'll tell you one thing that's Another little thing that I noticed that I do for sure is If someone comes at me and they're super mad about something I can't just be a hundred percent calm Because if if you come in the room and you go chocolate scrap the We're getting told to do this thing over in this total crap we should be able to do this and if I go Leave just calm down. And that's hard for seals because seals often one of just kind of where a you know mix and match of uniforms and and Kind of whatever gear that you want to look cool straight up long hair appear to all those things You recognize we needed to win you do that and and guys can get out of control We have all these patches made that are you know that are like look at these cool guy. It's it's the very early in jitsu where in your mind You think like you know what like I'll be able to I think I'll be able to get like jockel right I'm gonna focus on my one little white belt america I'm trying to get you know our bar versus versus like no detach and thank for the sounds like Four five getting that it's it's content that We talk about it and of course I love telling more stories as you all know from this in this podcast We like talking about worst stories we like talking about our time in the teams and even when you just you put that photo up there of you know of us and Ramadhi from back in the day You know whether I had deep respect and admiration for them or whether I despise them and thought they were you know Eagle maniac who you know are a coward who you know could mitigate risk so and that it's in my benefit of my team's benefit to build that relationship with with my team and That was that was a lesson that I had not learned then We're just letting them know like hey, there's gonna be a large gathering of people in In front of the hotel in the morning and they're like well, what time? I would be a hundred times more aggressive I would be putting up you know a Concept of the operations brief for your for your approval to send up the chain to swim across the river and Hit targets and and you know put in some cyber overwatches and just Completely ruin the bad guys program going on in South Central my when they had complete freedom movement before they had any Expectation that we could be there before you back get to us and I think They would never see a common which means that we would have more impact and it would actually be safer for us Because they wouldn't be expecting it so they would probably hammers, but we we recognized that we could get away with a lot more You know then then we could and looking back on it.
