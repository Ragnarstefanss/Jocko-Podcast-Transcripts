and I'm listening You know to see when a chance of me going forward what's what's the need what kind of talent that I have because I think most of us Marine Corps and different facets of society we have a place in society like I'm not a leader at all I'm a follower, but I'm a real good follower the command you know commanders intent I want to hear the commanders intent that I want to explore with the commander what that intent is I want to know what it really means Because sometimes the words don't convey what that person really thinks I want to know how I can support that person any way possible, you know what's his real meaning What's those words coming out of his mouth? They throw you over the over the deck or whatever in the water and to see if you're clustered Oh, yeah, the casual way that he said that was like oh, they just want to see if he's clustered You know what the suit that he's talking about I'm assuming it's the old school with that big ass Man like 20,000 weeks into the sea scenario You don't know say a clustered phobic uh in the bottom of the Bay Yeah, that seems like a way bigger deal than his tone was when he said it seems like not a lot of stuff was a big deal He was just jumping out of helicopters hooking in Apollo 12 going on patrol with with 30 Oh, by the way dropping danger close napa There was no team batch There was nothing I'm gonna tell you a little story you probably heard this many times So we get The pirate I don't know if you remember who Pete the pirate was I don't know his name, but I don't know So he supposedly designed the insignia for seal team right because he was drinking Budweiser one day and He'd submitted like 20 designs because they asked for T-guys and the teams to to do design now. and so they Commander their seal team says okay here's what we're gonna do we're gonna do a raid on this Nunary and we're gonna be very ugly to them when we go in and we go out So that we can protect them, you know, we're gonna act like we're gonna hook them and the kids up Yeah, because people explained it you know we had extensive training at the trade winds of What was happening and how things went down so then you got it you got you understood what's going on You know in that time it was much different than it is now because the or the navy controlled everything You were a navy asset all funding came from the navy as from not from so calm or being a national Asset like in seal team hey hey officer You know what let's hit rewind you can't do that you show up I'm you know you come to the master you come to jokk alive you roll up you got that you got that Copy a final spin and you're like I'd really like to get this sign that opened it up I'm gonna sign it. We pasteurize this when we have to add any of those chemicals look at you know it almost I almost got What's got some some guy commented on some Social maybe a thing use like all this You know just to standard he's trying up there he me trying a pitch you know some so you had no idea not a clue You didn't know it's gonna be physical you know nothing about hell week nothing You just thought you're going to a Navy school where you're gonna learn about whatever right some ran the Emolition and that type of thing diving and it would be nothing where you ran or Swam or whatever so what in your mind as you start getting Physically and mentally abused at a high level on Monday morning What made you say okay? and you know every seal team name that no demand So we start improving that camp because we know we're gonna have a lot of people laid on in that camp You know just not the 18 that we originally started with So we go to this camp and we start improving it So well I can tell you the you know the having the vehicles out there You never know when someone's gonna romp go wrong with a vehicle and to not have a good Mechanic there to ready to get those things up and running and like you said those those Homevies that we had because we got those homevies turned over up us What does it come out kind of remember 16th is when it comes out here's the thing You know the publisher saying The publisher like well, you know you're kind of a guy that might amount we either can't sign we know now Bequest so we could pick up those skills You know, but we were the last class to go into 13 so we didn't have the training that they had before that when they built the team and some of those guys I mean they had been to Vietnam like I don't know you wouldn't know tobacco alloo So he says He says now we got a lot of work for you to do we got to push all these guys out because you know the The reserves at that time weren't really we had kind of a Looser type of reserve unit and they weren't deployed that off it so some of them had ID cards that weren't current I mean there is you know You know plucking the kale from Fucking the kale from you know northern Bulgaria where it's grown without any Interference from man and then I've deemed for like you know like 38 points Probably you know, but what's it gonna be like we're just gonna be sitting you know watching victory at sea movie somewhere And not really going out and doing a lot It's weird though that someone would make that move like like like let's face it What's a good lesson alone when you're a kid that almost everybody learns don't judge a book by its cover Almost everybody Does it learns that lesson and here's a guy that double violated that number one Looking at me and judging the book by its cover and the number two straight up judge the book by its cover Straight up literally doing that and this guy's a professor Who's you know a liberal guy because I was seeing a who is this guy? right when you got done We're schooling did you go through any kind of pre-deployment workup like you know like I did my whole career was like Oh, you're getting ready to deploy you get put into a platoon So they're not gonna print enough and then people are gonna order it when it you know in on I'll know Number 14 through me like cool. And that was Jenny Posey that was Jenny yeah, by the way for those of you that are just listening to Jenny Posey was in the room You know because she did end of graduating from arm your ROTC that she was here Laffins because I could see her she was laughing at stories and and also you're still me after which never heard all these stories You know never heard all these stories about NAMM about getting thrown over the side into the into the dam bay to walk around for half an hour By the way, that's an ignorant test That's like the witch test that's like the witch test before you in the water and if you drown Then that means you're not a witch But you never know because they had the aircraft I mean excuse me the Air Force guys and C130s with the pair of guys Being able to jump out if it wasn't within because they knew once it started decelerating Coming out of the space because it had to go from 24,500 miles down to you know five miles an hour They knew upon a deceleration where it's gonna be so we would steam to that thing and it oh Oh, so if you didn't you know how you don't you know you did you got you get decayed a lot actually people don't know me Well when we were getting You know nobody wanted to come home at least most of the guys didn't want to come home because People didn't like you if you're a New York services if you had a haircut Like the most of us in this room they perceived you to be a soldier or a sailor and they didn't like you They had drop us off in the jungle and we'd put patrol through the jungle because they weren't expecting us you know at that time That was right after Tet so Tet and the United States was very demoralizing because Army always said you know we have this we have this sector we have this country we're doing Better every day and then Tet happens this massive battle and We beat them back of course, but a lot especially the Marines up north really took a beating and And after that as far as the people here in America I think we're that that was the end of Vietnam And so I really I like that because I mean these guys were slow and they had no ability to engage the enemy I mean we had 30 guys and if there were six guys engaging us, you know, they were freaking out You know Hi And with that War and Officer Bill Posey has left the building Some good stuff Man about how to Be a good frog man and how to be a good human A guy that's Been in the game and stayed in the game right stayed in the game 56 years old row and now on ops get It's funny to hear like everyone else or everyone's take on things you know you have various guests Jura Dally here so I always try to defer that or push it back to my boss Because that's what makes you valuable and if you need a favor some time those people will come Forward and I learned that and Vietnam When we would go to these different places They would leave like flags and pictures of Different things and China and pottery Then we were able to take those assets to the guys that were on the navy bases and if we needed You know cases see rats at the time or Would you guys mind you're unloading all this beer out of this ship and Would you guys mind pushing a pallet of this beer off the dock and let it fall into the water We're gonna turn around and we're gonna do a five and five on you I said really I said you got this you know I said okay It's what's gonna do So what do we got and what do we have them for we got them for your joints for your mind for your body and For your muscles directly joint warfare Don't worry work for your oil super krill oil These are for your joints like okay, and this is gonna be a big deal Because if your joints failure you can be strong You can be strong you can be capable you can run everyday you're joined start failing you start bothering you Whatever good is it having a 454 big block a Yes, so you kind of like if he don't know he just decayed You know decayed means no, didn't know
