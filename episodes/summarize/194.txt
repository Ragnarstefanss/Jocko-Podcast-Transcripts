yeah I love the fact that we like we we're calling the jeans legit fit you know now while we're doing all this meanwhile I'm out starting jockel publishing you know I have a I'm like hey man by the way I've got you know whatever I'm gonna be I got 100,000 books that you know I'm gonna need to get moved from place to place we have a fulfillment center like you're like but this this thing of sitting in front of somebody and having a conversation and building relationships what I found in this shoe making thing is the most important thing because these are still the guys running it the same guys running it in the in the in the dudes these shoe dogs that have been in the factory helping us combine age 88 90 and we've probably had a dozen in there and you should see their freaking eyeballs when they walk in they don't want to leave honestly on occasion bringing tears to their eyes that that this is what we're doing because they saw it they were part of it and they saw it leave and just that spark man like you know I'm honestly just hit me it's me right in the feels man that spark they see it's motivation and I absolutely knew that were there support it was going to be possible and so we've been grinding this the first pair of boots that that I got that you sent me the first pair of the boots you sent me it was better than the first pair of jeans you sent me that that was a shocker to me like it was like take them out of the box I was like no way this is ridiculous and and you know you're like I do like I do like both but for me I like when you're talking but for echo I like when things explode like when you're like that's a good idea hopefully they don't like pull down you're post on they're post on Instagram but like the other day when you're like and I said yeah he goes take it all loaded up a tractor trailer of machinery a small if I can 20 foot you know and a couple weeks ago Joe my father learned I and a few other guys from the factory went out and cooked his whole staff a lobster bake lobster bake for old shoe machinery but these shoe dogs so shoe dog is the term that is just used it's a general term for someone who's been in the industry for a long time but you know as we were talking at the end of the last year and you know I kind of put your I guess concerns that ease a little bit for sure for no it's like we can make shoes you know we don't have to reinvent anything even though we need to build it from scratch there's a difference there you know if we're going to like try to figure it out and not have the knowledge that would be one thing but the knowledge has only been it's only been removed for 20 years right if it had been removed for 50 years I'm not going to say it's impossible yeah it seems like this is one elevation above that just one it seems like someone made this thing out of little right a vector set pieces that's what it seems that's what those helicopters feel like when you get in them and when you find them that's what they feel like if you don't like flying you're not going to be game for that especially with decoda track I will declare you as the climb plus you weigh 900 pounds so that would be like flying lopsided people he is a savage and we're actually going to get to do that and drink form the You could sell a pair of American you know standard American jeans that cost $16 at the grocery store at the department store and you could bring them to sell them for a hundred dollars I remember hearing that $100 and I had like two pairs of jeans or three pairs of jeans and I'm thinking hey can you take these can you try and get a hundred dollars for these things and that was and that to me has always said that those people over there identified blue jeans like the like you're saying the East Coast you look at the cowboy and said that's the spirit of freedom right there and you know the thing is is you know when I get into something I go deep that's why we ended up building a factory in my backyard it's a game changer product you know it's not it's hard to explain man like it like when you're underneath somebody you know like we're an old ghee let's say you're underneath somebody inside control you've been sweating the whole match your 10 minutes in and you need to like elbow escape or hip out and your arms stuck inside the sleeve because of the abrasion of the the text what you're gonna feel is free you know I love it you know that's truly my passion is being in the game not what the not not winning the game not winning the championship not looking to to an end goal like if we achieve this we've won you know it's it's just it's just if we achieve this what can we do next exactly where can we go from there exactly I look at one thing that I like doing and I like being a part of and one thing that I like about working with you is it doesn't seem like I can say because what I remember when I was a kid you know at my school like kids would go on like a school trip to wherever England or Spain or something like that like the Spanish class there'd be kids that would go on a school trip and what people would say is like you got to bring jeans bring jeans you can sell them. oh everyone has you know one or two a day like 5000 cans you're gonna go through 5000 cans this week on the house come to the immersion camp get some free jocco white tea all right big that also jocco as a store store of his own online store jocco store dot com is where you can get you know discipline equals freedom represent while you're on the path all right just pick them sweet them shirt with his head on it says good also short without his head that says good if you don't uh if you don't like my head That's the same theory that we have with EF overwatch With with hiring vets were bringing vets in look a veteran might not have worked in whatever industry you're in But that person is hungry they got leadership skills and they got discipline They end especially the group that we got we got they they study and trained in extreme ownership and the principles So they they know how to lead and We're getting the feedback that we're getting is phenomenal because people hire somebody and they go What they you know they feel like they're taking a little bit of a risk because the person it's you know and it's Rachel and the biggest thing that that built the infrastructure for the New England mills were the canal systems and if you pulled the stones out of like the canal system in Lewiston you could build another great pyramid if you pulled the granite out of these canal systems you could build another great pyramid think about what they did a hundred years ago in Lewiston Maine they built a great pyramid in the form of a canal system and they did it without technology they couldn't look up leg twist in jeans and solve the problem right we can so to say it can't be done I'd never say that we've got technology we've still got people that know we've got jets that can get us you know you can jump in on a jet blue flight and get to Europe in eight hours or twelve hours if you need to go see how something works or if I need to go to California if I need to just drive to low Massachusetts and I think I think that I think we're gonna have some challenges ahead of us because we've Expanded the three locations, but we've almost created a bermuted triangle of sorts the way that we Secured the locations the facilities it's efficient It's like lean manufacturing of you know in between the factories You know the way you can get from you know one point to the next to maximize Maximizer time, but You know the lab's facility is awesome and why we fulfill them 500 to 1000 packages a day out of there for filling Yeah, you know when you come safe well, you know as exactly exactly just turn it on because You know managing you know all these people managing you know the factory a couple of occasions and the growth right You know it's it's weird because you you got people who go through let's say they go to college to be you know business management or leadership Whatever There's so much potential and people who just want to work and be part of something There's so they find so much motivation in that I would rather have someone and When I do like job interviews I say hey like one of the first questions Are you looking for a job or are you looking for a career and that's kind of a loaded question right when I hear I'm looking for a career and I feel like jiu jitsu is like a spark you know looking at those matches like the spark like whoa wait a second I bet there's every type of political affiliation on the mats right now I'm it's worth the tuition payment I was going to say if we're wrong at least I'll be able to sleep exactly and I think that's what when you're distilled it down that's what it that's what you get right is you know you can cut corners in the way you start at this you can cut corners here there the other place but what is the right thing to do you know like with the genes what's the right thing to do well build the product that's going to last lifetime that's actually the right thing to do that will never fall apart and Yeah, we're gonna gather and Just like a beehive man just like a freaking beehive walking in that place in the morning We're gonna I don't know if you want me to say this or not about what about two we're gonna make another pair of jeans That's gonna be lighter weight now echo Charles. yes we do and boom all of a sudden next you know we we got a fulfillment center we got the warrior kid three we got Mikey the Dragons there you're we just absorb that it was like it was one of those things that I'll give me the freedom to tell my publisher watch this on publishing you know I got a publishing company now watch this and to have the freedom to be able to do that was phenomenal because I knew I was like It's like it doesn't exist until now and it's weird to say that about I guess it'd be I don't know what's a good what's a clothing product that like completely Change like it didn't exist and now it does I would say that's easy that that would be the compression shirt under I'm okay, I'm out with because we both like college football Remember we had the grades the cotton the culture and I took my wife Amanda to the The monster and DC and my father on La Jo and Brian our business partner came and his wife Megan and and we went through it and When you discussed this Does it always have to be a hundred percent like I feel like I'm gonna make a hundred percent decision Maybe that's a little bit of ego talking, you know, but I feel like my decision is always gonna be a hundred percent and that's the that's the important I mean it's a it's a beautiful thing really you know to that you can be empowered by something on your body you know and and people say well that's that's not it's not important you know what you wear well it's really not important what you wear but it is important how you feel about yourself you know it is important how you project yourself you know I would just kept shoveling your busy I don't think you even know you're thinking what is what is like the sweet Like part they're the the moist like they're really like almost wet part But as far as you know the psychological trauma of all the you know brain damage about this and that the other thing is very limited right now Which is amazing to see yeah, it is and you we're talking about people who weren't leaders prior to Origin you know nobody had a leadership position nobody had a management position You know and the the leaders that we've built There they're not entitled to it And when I was up here and seeing the factory and being you know just kind of in that Spiritual high From seeing our people American people working hard Like dedicated like passionate about doing a good like just seeing everything in action and I was flying home you're like and when you do it put put put the umla above it put the two dots I was like I don't know how to put I don't know how to do that on the computer you're like hold down this key and press this and so the people are aware and that's I think that's one of the things that Has I'm not saying there's not growing pains because I mean of course there's growing pains but most of the growing pains are are like Almost like physical growing pains sure you know like when you're when you're sun grows four inches in six months you know you you know when you travel in the just like your nose you just you just like wake up your mouth tastes like crap I mean it's you gotta remember like leather like text styles depending on how it's tanned it can be you know it can stretch more be more rigid and not form right it can wrinkle you know there's all sorts of shit that can happen that that's really bad I mean you have the opportunity to travel quickly you're not getting on a boat on the ocean and that's what they were doing they were transporting this stuff with horse and buggy on rails across the ocean and you're telling me it's impossible are you freaking kidding me this is the easiest time we've ever had to do this and that's why it's not crazy because of what we do have we're fortunate to be in a day and age where we can get information like that you know it's just a matter of putting hands and dirt that's what people are scared of you know they don't know how good calluses feel if they did yeah we have a youtube channel jockel podcast youtube channel also some excerpts on there you know cut up the podcast I like what you've been doing lately with everything I like the content you know polo's excerpts snippets out yeah modality different modalities one modality might be we want to get smarter right we want to train our brain right we want to train our our our a real bit capacity sure we want to train our defensive capabilities yes we want to train our strength we want to train our reflexes I mean we're just want to train in a bunch of different modalities do you know anything that really helps across a broad spectrum spectrum of modalities like that 100% he's like I'm bringing my A game watch this did you want to know something that like feels real good my son came in and he was meeting with your with Dr. Luke I wanted him to learn a little bit about you know medicine because he's a student medicine and he stayed for lunch at the immersion camp here yes he's like he's like girl that's what he needs I know he's like bro you and Brian got to come down to Texas I mean like It synthesized and we you know I don't I don't know if I told you how much money we spent on developing this You might have kept that for me I probably just did take Kelly, but you know we we had the I think I told you we had the order It's a batch of yarn we had and you've got to set up the friggin loom but it was all you know Henry with an exacto knife like hand cutting everything whatever we started building the patterns they weren't perfect so you got to imagine like eight months we're now into this thing eight months once once we actually got a boot of course he started with a 14 wrong and that would bite us in the ass six months down the road that was that was the tuition payment I wanted him to start with a 14 because I wanted to wear it first not knowing that six months down the road that would be a mistake because you never grade grading is how you scale everything you never grade from your largest size you always grade from the middle from the middle size so I was definitely more hesitant on the on the just the product itself and then on the manufacturing to me it just seemed like crazy thing and you you're laughing I don't know if you remember this you were laughing you were like you were laughing you like bro it's so much easier to make boots and it is to make to to weave fabric on a loop Nikki she's 19 another guy who's in there Christine and Henry those two combined experience like 80 years you know the little way stitches telling you about and Henry and we're like literally once you and I have a conversation like and she's been wearing your daughter might be too old for this trend but a lot of girls right now that are younger maybe six seven eight nine they were basically a matching kind of whole polyester like dry fit type outfit like that's the whole thing right like the and I think some of that laughter was more like I'm ready for the challenge you know what I mean like this is the thing is is you know so they became so popular that East Berlin government decided East Germany government decided we're gonna make jeans and they did they made jeans and I picked up a pair of those jeans I found someone who had a pair and they weren't jeans they didn't know how to weave the text out and they couldn't figure it out so what one of they were they just like some weird fabric like it was a weird fabric and it wasn't even in the go died and they just like dumped their knowledge on but Henry Henry being the key in this guy mole and so I'm like I need machinery so he found all the old machinery overseas he brought it back over on a purely bringing machinery that's been shipped overseas you're along with the jobs literally we're bringing it back to America you know actually happening actually happening machines designed in New Hampshire and it machines designed in Massachusetts manufactured right there bringing them back these old machines and Mo refurbished them and now they're in the factory and it's badass You know it was uh I knew we could make the product you know and honestly like I always wanted like I couldn't have fit for a nice jeans as a kid and we had dinner in this old Russian restaurant and it was it was like this this scene like you'd see it a movie or something you know with the yellow lights and all the pictures on the wall and we're sitting there intimate like this having dinner and you're like What do you mean I'm like you know the 70 percent hundred you're like Shack And I know not everyone does you do too, but The rift ghee is like It's like a complete it's it's like a new product. so I went back to the source mo this is what I want to do and he's wild you know this guy he he told me a story you you have heard of Dexter shoe of course there was a man named Harold Alphan no Harold Alphan built Dexter shoe he built it he was working at another shoe company he built it by loading up machines that weren't being used like in the during the night time into his station wagon and driving them to a mill in Dexter he basically took the machines that were like the abandoned machines from the southern factory and he started a factory and he built an empire And yet we've seen that take place We've seen that take place in our own country In cities and in towns and in states where Saving a dollar Man closing a mill and Man shutting down a factory In places where making more money in the next financial quarter Caused leadership to forget the long-term impact And sell the future of those people for cash in hand in the immediate And That Disease that plague of greed can spread And it has hurt various parts of America at various times And when that's happening while the people at the top might build themselves A fortune it's a fortune built On despair and it's a fortune built on destruction and in the end That will come back to hunt them Because it is not the right thing to do Then it does not have to be that way Because Because there are leaders who recognize the long-term positive impact of growth and the long-term positive impact of putting your people first Putting your community first Putting your country first And one of those leaders Happens to be a business partner of mine happens to be a friend of mine And his name is Pete Roberts the founder of or gin us a and once again We are in the woods in the foothills of mains western mountains For our jiu jitsu immersion camp Which means it's time for us to record a podcast and if you don't know Pete Then go back and listen to podcast 93 and then listen to podcast 141 and then you

moving it's like a perfect
