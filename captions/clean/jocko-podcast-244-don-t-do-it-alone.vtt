00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.32
This is Jocco podcast number 244 with echo Charles and me, Jocco Willink. Good evening,

2
00:00:06.32 --> 00:00:11.84
echo. Good evening. And also joining me tonight is Mike Sarelli and George Randall.

3
00:00:11.84 --> 00:00:18.80
And if you haven't listened to, when Mike came on the podcast for the first time, go listen to that.

4
00:00:18.80 --> 00:00:27.36
It was number 134. Mike was in task in the bruiser in the battle of the body. And after that,

5
00:00:27.36 --> 00:00:34.88
he did another nine combat deployments. And he is part of our leadership consultancy,

6
00:00:34.88 --> 00:00:42.64
echelon front, where he also heads up our talent acquisition firm, which is called EF overwatch.

7
00:00:42.64 --> 00:00:50.96
Mike, welcome back. And also George Randall, is an army vet, came up through the ranks from

8
00:00:50.96 --> 00:00:56.000
enlisted to officer, which I guess we all have that in common. And then left the army for the

9
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:03.68
corporate world, where eventually we became a talent acquisition executive. That sounds impressive.

10
00:01:05.36 --> 00:01:10.16
Always keeping a focus on recruiting veterans and coaching them through the transition

11
00:01:10.88 --> 00:01:15.60
to civilian life. Now there's all kinds of things we could talk about. But today we're going

12
00:01:15.60 --> 00:01:21.36
to focus on, well, it's been one of the focuses that we've had for several years at echelon front.

13
00:01:21.36 --> 00:01:27.28
And it's a focus that you guys have taken and absolutely run with. And that is talent.

14
00:01:28.96 --> 00:01:34.56
It is finding, recruiting, acquiring and retaining the best people.

15
00:01:36.56 --> 00:01:42.40
Obviously, all those things are a subset of leadership. But it's a subset that both of you have

16
00:01:42.40 --> 00:01:50.32
been focused on. And it's a subset that gets left out a lot in people ignore it. And

17
00:01:50.32 --> 00:01:58.88
Mike, you, you, you started GFO Overwatch. And you guys got so possessed by this that you guys have

18
00:01:58.88 --> 00:02:06.72
just written a book. And the book is called The Talent War. And you've done a great job of

19
00:02:09.04 --> 00:02:12.96
covering, you know, this topic in the book. And I want to jump into it. And I'm going to do something

20
00:02:12.96 --> 00:02:18.48
right now that might be considered lame. I don't know. I'm not 100% sure, but I'm going to start

21
00:02:18.48 --> 00:02:26.000
with a quote from the book. But the quote that I'm going to start with from the book is a quote from me,

22
00:02:26.64 --> 00:02:31.84
because I wrote the forward. So maybe that's lame. But here it is. Leadership is the most important

23
00:02:31.84 --> 00:02:37.68
thing on the battlefield. And the most important thing in business and in life. It is leadership that

24
00:02:37.68 --> 00:02:43.04
sets the example. It is leadership that makes decisions. It is leadership that unifies a team around

25
00:02:43.04 --> 00:02:48.96
a common goal. And it is leadership that takes care of the team and gets the mission done. But

26
00:02:48.96 --> 00:02:56.56
one of the most important roles of the leader is often overlooked. The responsibility of building

27
00:02:56.56 --> 00:03:04.16
the team in the first place. The leader is responsible for training, equipping, and directing a team.

28
00:03:04.16 --> 00:03:11.84
But before any of that is possible, the leader must recruit, screen, and acquire the right people

29
00:03:11.84 --> 00:03:20.32
for the team. And that's a little bit from the forward. And then it jumps into this book that you

30
00:03:20.32 --> 00:03:28.88
guys wrote. Before we jump into it, at what point did you start thinking that that we needed

31
00:03:28.88 --> 00:03:32.96
right about this, that we needed to do something about this? Were you thinking about this as you

32
00:03:32.96 --> 00:03:37.68
stood up, EFO Overwatch? As you guys started banging your heads together and moving forward with this,

33
00:03:37.68 --> 00:03:43.52
Mike, at what point did you start looking at, hey, we need to start telling people about talent

34
00:03:43.52 --> 00:03:48.80
and how they need to handle it as leaders? You know, I love how you just said it's a subset of

35
00:03:48.80 --> 00:03:53.52
leadership. But absolutely, as you just said, it's one of the most overlooked parts is before you even

36
00:03:53.52 --> 00:03:59.60
step out on an adventure. You got to formulate the team. And that's hard. And really,

37
00:04:01.52 --> 00:04:05.52
Georgia and I nerd out on this, where other people are talking about, you know, just you too.

38
00:04:05.52 --> 00:04:11.12
We're talking about talent acquisition. And if anyone calls me and nerd, I'll gladly provide

39
00:04:11.12 --> 00:04:17.04
my address. You can come out of a conversation with me. No, I'm joking. So the amount of companies

40
00:04:17.04 --> 00:04:22.08
we run into that reach out to us and say, hey, we need help. And, you know, we're very genuine.

41
00:04:22.08 --> 00:04:27.36
We want to see our clients succeed. That's our primary goal. We also want to see our candidates

42
00:04:27.36 --> 00:04:35.28
you know, prosper in those positions that we place them in. But they are at a loss

43
00:04:36.32 --> 00:04:42.32
for what the correct steps are. And as we looked at it, it sort of out of frustration of wanting

44
00:04:42.32 --> 00:04:48.72
to help them and them not always following our guidance, we during our conversations, we talked about

45
00:04:48.72 --> 00:04:54.80
a lot about the special operations community and how it's taking them decades to create a world

46
00:04:54.80 --> 00:05:00.48
class talent acquisition process. Do they call it something different? It's not hiring. We call

47
00:05:00.48 --> 00:05:07.84
assessment and insolention. And so one day, I, you know, usually how I carry out my ideas. I was

48
00:05:07.84 --> 00:05:11.12
probably watching TV and something came in my head. I picked up the phone called Jordan said, hey,

49
00:05:11.12 --> 00:05:15.52
we should write a book on this. And he said, okay. And then we started researching it. You know,

50
00:05:15.52 --> 00:05:21.92
we didn't think all the way through it. You know, most of my ideas are half baked. And, you know,

51
00:05:21.92 --> 00:05:27.12
voila, we found somebody to assist us through the process because neither of us had written a book.

52
00:05:28.16 --> 00:05:32.08
I knew two guys at Roto Book, I didn't reach out to him, which was probably the biggest mistake.

53
00:05:32.08 --> 00:05:40.88
And we're learning a lot of that. The hard way, but this journey has been awesome. And it's

54
00:05:40.88 --> 00:05:45.92
actually solidified and changed some of the views we have on talent going through this process and

55
00:05:45.92 --> 00:05:51.84
all the interviews. So George, how did you two link up? Well, it was funny. I was actually listening

56
00:05:51.84 --> 00:05:58.80
to podcast 134. And so I'm listening to this. And then you all mentioned, you have overwatch

57
00:05:58.80 --> 00:06:04.32
in Austin. I'm like, you got to be kidding me. So I reached out to Mike Unlinkedin and I said, hey,

58
00:06:04.32 --> 00:06:09.60
you know what? We need some world class leaders where I work. You know, and he wrote back

59
00:06:09.60 --> 00:06:14.64
within minutes. And the next thing, you know, where it breakfast at Kirby Lane in Austin. And,

60
00:06:14.64 --> 00:06:21.12
you know, it was like, wow, I found my counterpart. I got somebody who thinks about talent like I do.

61
00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:29.12
And it rapidly took off from there. You know, ultimately leading to the wedding, which at some point

62
00:06:29.12 --> 00:06:34.72
we might talk about. I didn't marry George. Let's just, there was no wedding. I'll let him continue.

63
00:06:34.72 --> 00:06:41.92
He asked I was already spoken for. So, but yeah, and we just really started to think, okay,

64
00:06:41.92 --> 00:06:47.76
how do we pair up my 20 years in talent acquisition in his 20 years in special operations? And

65
00:06:47.76 --> 00:06:54.16
there was just so much synergy there in an instant. And we were fortunate to see it and take off with it.

66
00:06:54.88 --> 00:06:59.84
Yeah, you know, from when Mike originally started talking to me and and late about, you know,

67
00:06:59.84 --> 00:07:04.88
doing something with talent acquisition for people, it was such a no-brainer because all of these

68
00:07:04.88 --> 00:07:08.72
companies we work with. We got to work with the company. We spent two days with them. And at the end,

69
00:07:08.72 --> 00:07:13.44
you know what they say? They say, we would really love to have a couple people with your backgrounds.

70
00:07:13.44 --> 00:07:17.52
Or, you know, do you know what we can find people? We were getting, we heard that for years and years

71
00:07:17.52 --> 00:07:22.88
and years. Where can we get people that have this mindset, this leadership skill set? Where do we find them?

72
00:07:22.88 --> 00:07:26.64
And you know, Nathan, I would kind of struggle as well. You can try and hire vets or whatever.

73
00:07:26.64 --> 00:07:31.44
And then when Mike got on board and, you know, he just said, hey, we can actually do this because

74
00:07:31.44 --> 00:07:38.000
your background with vetted. And it was, it was just such an obvious answer to help the clients that we

75
00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:45.44
have at Escalafron be able to get good people. And on top of that, take veterans that are coming

76
00:07:45.44 --> 00:07:49.36
out that have been institutionalized because I don't know if a better way to describe it because

77
00:07:49.36 --> 00:07:52.48
I know I was damn sure institutionalized. You know, I spent my entire adult life in the

78
00:07:52.48 --> 00:07:57.20
sealed teams had no idea. I'll tell people people would be like, you know, when you started

79
00:07:57.20 --> 00:08:02.24
teaching leadership, like, how did you know it was going to work in the civilian world? I didn't,

80
00:08:02.24 --> 00:08:05.76
I didn't. The first time I sat down with the CEO and I was talking to them, I had no idea

81
00:08:05.76 --> 00:08:14.48
that almost never mind, almost that that line for line, the leadership that we talked to seals

82
00:08:14.48 --> 00:08:20.08
was the exact same leadership that was needed in a company or in a team. And as soon as I realized

83
00:08:20.08 --> 00:08:24.24
that, I said, we've got something very special here because we had distilled it down and it

84
00:08:24.24 --> 00:08:29.36
made so much sense and he had been tested. As soon as got out in the civilian sector, same thing.

85
00:08:29.36 --> 00:08:37.84
So when Mike started saying, hey, we could actually help the military folks and help the civilian

86
00:08:37.84 --> 00:08:43.04
companies. I mean, this is just a win, win across the board. You know, you've got both sides

87
00:08:43.04 --> 00:08:48.16
of the equation that absolutely benefit from doing this math and it doesn't get any better than that.

88
00:08:50.40 --> 00:08:58.32
So to actually now jump into the book a little bit, kicks this off in chapter one,

89
00:08:58.32 --> 00:09:04.08
you can't see talent. A Navy seal instructor told Dr. Josh Cotton. Tell me about Josh Cotton

90
00:09:04.08 --> 00:09:10.64
before I think in here. So Josh is our counterpart, help with right the book. Josh and I connected

91
00:09:10.64 --> 00:09:16.88
through multiple, multiple contacts of Josh's story is interesting. You know, you think Werner

92
00:09:16.88 --> 00:09:21.92
Josh is the ultimate nerd and I give him a crap for that. He loves data. He's an industrial

93
00:09:21.92 --> 00:09:27.60
organization on psychologist. Well, when he was finishing his doctorate, he worked with the Navy

94
00:09:27.60 --> 00:09:32.96
out of Millington and eventually a contract came along where which was offered to him to work with

95
00:09:32.96 --> 00:09:40.08
the Navy seals to assess how they assess and select talent into their community. So he also worked

96
00:09:40.08 --> 00:09:45.28
with a little bit with the Mars community, the Arnold Army Special Operations Special Forces Community

97
00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:52.72
and he gained experience that most doctors, I know, had a close psychologist, don't receive.

98
00:09:52.72 --> 00:09:56.88
And then he took what he found based off assessing high performers, which arguably,

99
00:09:56.88 --> 00:10:02.40
to special operations community is a bunch of high performers and how do you apply that to a business

100
00:10:02.40 --> 00:10:07.52
setting? And it resonated extremely well. So as he stepped out of that contract, he stepped into the

101
00:10:07.52 --> 00:10:13.52
Fortune 500 right now. You know, he's the director of talent assessments for a major Fortune

102
00:10:13.52 --> 00:10:21.04
500 company throughout the organization. And so he's, you know, he's looking at all this data

103
00:10:21.84 --> 00:10:25.76
at performers at different levels of the organization. And that's where he came into the book.

104
00:10:25.76 --> 00:10:33.36
You know what that reminds me of. So at some point, I was talking to one of the guys that worked

105
00:10:33.36 --> 00:10:38.88
at Buds as a civilian contractor, as what's the real word for an athletic trainer? Is it just

106
00:10:38.88 --> 00:10:41.92
called an athletic trainer? Is that what it is? Is that the job, especially someone that

107
00:10:41.92 --> 00:10:45.36
looks at your spring, Dankel or whatever? Is that what it is? Echo Charles? Trainer? Yeah.

108
00:10:45.36 --> 00:10:51.12
Trainer? So I was talking to one of those guys and he was talking about

109
00:10:51.12 --> 00:10:57.44
Patella for moral syndrome. So Patella for moral syndrome is this thing that you can get. And it's

110
00:10:57.44 --> 00:11:05.20
where you're, you're, you're Patella, somehow, rubs against your, your femur or you're a

111
00:11:05.20 --> 00:11:11.04
Patella tendon, rubs against your femur and it gets sore and swollen, right? And he said, you know,

112
00:11:11.04 --> 00:11:15.68
in the civilian world at a football team, at a baseball team, at a college football team, whatever,

113
00:11:15.68 --> 00:11:23.28
he says, you might see a case of Patella for moral syndrome. You might see three in a season.

114
00:11:24.24 --> 00:11:33.28
He said, I see seven cases of Patella for moral syndrome, a date at Buds. So what I'm saying is,

115
00:11:33.28 --> 00:11:37.84
you take this doctor that's used to looking at whatever, the assessment of some

116
00:11:37.84 --> 00:11:41.04
civilian organization, we're going to assess some candidates and, you know, see what,

117
00:11:41.04 --> 00:11:44.72
see where they're at and see where that mentally and see where that psychologically and

118
00:11:44.72 --> 00:11:48.40
you have to wait for months and months to see how they actually perform when do they get put

119
00:11:48.40 --> 00:11:55.52
under pressure at Buds? It's like, oh, here you go, here's a, here's a 180 people that are

120
00:11:55.52 --> 00:12:01.36
about to get the biggest mental stress of their life in the next four weeks and you get to look at.

121
00:12:01.36 --> 00:12:05.12
That's, that's, that's an amazing way to get to get experience. And that's what happened with these

122
00:12:05.12 --> 00:12:09.20
guys that would, would athletic trainers. And it was a couple different approaches that guys would

123
00:12:09.20 --> 00:12:15.36
have. Some guys would, they would leave like a pro sports team and and come to Buds and they

124
00:12:15.36 --> 00:12:20.88
would never want to leave because they were so, so much help or they'd come and get all that

125
00:12:20.88 --> 00:12:26.80
experience and then they'd go to a team because, you know, after you've seen hundreds of cases of

126
00:12:26.80 --> 00:12:32.08
Patella for moral syndrome and ITB issues and whatever, all those little injuries that they deal

127
00:12:32.08 --> 00:12:36.32
with all the time, they show up at a baseball team, they can identify things so much easier than

128
00:12:36.32 --> 00:12:41.92
anybody else could. And so that's what it sounds like. This, this doctor cotton is. And to take

129
00:12:41.92 --> 00:12:46.32
it one step further following that experience, he created something completely based off special

130
00:12:46.32 --> 00:12:51.84
operations and how we classify, you know, high performers, it's called the elite performance

131
00:12:51.84 --> 00:12:58.56
indicator of the EPI and he developed that personal assessment tool, which is now used by business

132
00:12:58.56 --> 00:13:04.80
is and what we're going to be using sort of is our indexes, just one of many assessments of our

133
00:13:04.80 --> 00:13:08.88
candidates for the EFO watch candidates that come to us from the military.

134
00:13:08.88 --> 00:13:13.04
Bud, yeah. All right. So now that we've got Dr. Josh cotton, we know about him and so I'll

135
00:13:13.04 --> 00:13:18.80
take it from the top. You can't see talent. A Navy SEAL instructor told Dr. Josh cotton,

136
00:13:18.80 --> 00:13:23.76
it's not the biggest guy or the strongest or the fastest. You have to trust the process.

137
00:13:23.76 --> 00:13:28.88
The process will reveal who has the potential to become a SEAL. Dr. Cotton was working with

138
00:13:28.88 --> 00:13:32.48
the Navy SEAL community to improve their assessment and selection process. To that end,

139
00:13:32.48 --> 00:13:37.28
he'd been asking all the instructors what do you look for in recruits. He had received a lot of

140
00:13:37.28 --> 00:13:42.08
insightful answers. People who don't quit, team players who step up and lead, resiliency, people who

141
00:13:42.08 --> 00:13:47.60
are calm under pressure, problem solvers. This was the first instructor who had taken their question

142
00:13:47.60 --> 00:13:53.92
literally, but it was a good answer because you can't inherently see talent, not in somebody's physical

143
00:13:53.92 --> 00:14:00.56
appearance and especially not on their resume. Now we go into this little case study, which is

144
00:14:00.56 --> 00:14:04.96
interesting about this is people ask me, you know, like who's going to meet you? You think that

145
00:14:04.96 --> 00:14:12.40
guy is going to make it? I've said, I have no idea because you can't tell. In fact, there was a guy

146
00:14:12.40 --> 00:14:20.08
who was a captain and a great guy and he had never signed anyone off and said, this guy is going to

147
00:14:20.08 --> 00:14:27.52
make it and he eventually got this candidate through whatever relationships he had, this candidate

148
00:14:27.52 --> 00:14:33.28
came out, this guy was like a multi-language really diverse background, seemed like he had a bunch of

149
00:14:33.28 --> 00:14:40.96
bunch of experience highly educated and he signed off on the guy and this is the one guy he signed off

150
00:14:40.96 --> 00:14:45.52
of to be an officer in the sealed teams and the guy quit and he said, I'll never sign off and he

151
00:14:45.52 --> 00:14:49.60
interviewed him. The whole line you had to go to the captain in the sealed teams. Signed off

152
00:14:49.60 --> 00:14:54.24
on the guy, he quit, he said, I'll never sign off on anyone again. Now let's be honest, just

153
00:14:54.24 --> 00:14:58.96
and start that way. When it was 25 year old, Jocca, you were like hey, that guy, as you watch all

154
00:14:58.96 --> 00:15:04.000
of it, but I can't at lines up y'all. He played football in a D1 school, he's going to make it,

155
00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:08.08
or any of that kid that did speech into debate, he's going to be gone within the first two weeks,

156
00:15:08.08 --> 00:15:13.12
dude, in fact you say life humbles you, you still be learning, you don't know, you don't even

157
00:15:13.12 --> 00:15:19.04
have to go to 25 year old, you're Jocca, you can go to 19 years old, as I'm watching guys that were

158
00:15:19.04 --> 00:15:25.12
infinitely better qualified and you know, athletically more talented than me and I'm watching them

159
00:15:25.12 --> 00:15:29.12
quit and I was like okay, I guess there's no telling who's going to get through this program

160
00:15:30.32 --> 00:15:36.08
and speaking of which is the way you get to. Going back to the book, Mike embarrassly learned

161
00:15:36.08 --> 00:15:40.48
this lesson firsthand when he was a student at going through Naval Special Warfare under water

162
00:15:40.48 --> 00:15:47.20
demolition seal training, but Mike was a prior-listed recon Marine and by the way I'm talking

163
00:15:47.20 --> 00:15:51.20
about Mike, Mike's really sitting right here. Mike was a prior-listed recon Marine, one of the

164
00:15:51.20 --> 00:15:54.72
Marine Corps Special Operation capable forces which later became an official part of the Special

165
00:15:54.72 --> 00:15:59.84
Operations Community in 2006 and Scouts Kniver in May of 2003, he was discharged as a sergeant

166
00:15:59.84 --> 00:16:04.88
and commissioned as a Naval Officer and issued immediate orders to buds the Marines at taught him how

167
00:16:04.88 --> 00:16:09.76
to lead a team and he foolishly and arrogantly believed that his natural, that this naturally led

168
00:16:09.76 --> 00:16:13.76
to the ability to determine which candidates would make great seals and which candidates didn't

169
00:16:13.76 --> 00:16:19.28
deserve to be there. His six months in buds would be a brutal lesson in humility on how wrong he

170
00:16:19.28 --> 00:16:24.56
was and his ideas about evaluating candidates. How could he be in a position to determine who would

171
00:16:24.56 --> 00:16:29.44
make great special operations soldier when he was competing for the very honor the other students

172
00:16:29.44 --> 00:16:34.24
we're striving for. In this class Mike made the same class mistake that every business leader or

173
00:16:34.24 --> 00:16:38.88
HR manager makes when they toss a resume into the trash because the candidate doesn't have the

174
00:16:38.88 --> 00:16:45.60
exact education or industry experience required. Like most hiring managers today he judged a book

175
00:16:45.60 --> 00:16:52.72
by its cover that book was Ryan Job. Ryan didn't look like a seal. He was on the heavier side

176
00:16:52.72 --> 00:16:56.96
for a seal at least and nobody knew how he'd make it through the initial how he'd made it through

177
00:16:56.96 --> 00:17:01.76
the initial physical standards to even get into buts. Mike looked at Ryan and he made a snap

178
00:17:01.76 --> 00:17:06.40
judgment. This guy's not going to make it he thought. Mike wasn't the only one who thought so.

179
00:17:06.40 --> 00:17:10.72
The rest of the class and the seal instructors all thought Ryan didn't fit the mold of the seal.

180
00:17:11.36 --> 00:17:17.12
Since everybody expected Ryan to quit the instructors decided to speed the process along.

181
00:17:17.12 --> 00:17:21.60
They threw everything they could at Ryan with within ethical and legal means of course

182
00:17:23.04 --> 00:17:27.60
interesting note you made there. Of course interesting of course it was within ethical and legal

183
00:17:27.60 --> 00:17:32.40
means buts is already among the most intensive physical and mental training a person can endure

184
00:17:32.40 --> 00:17:36.000
and it was even harder for Ryan. The instructors made him run extra miles and do more pushups.

185
00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.28
They forced him to be called let in Sandy longer than the rest of the students. By the end of

186
00:17:39.28 --> 00:17:44.32
hell week approximately two months in retraining the class had gone from 250 students down to 35.

187
00:17:44.32 --> 00:17:49.12
Recruit after recruit rang the bell three times signifying a DOR drop on request or

188
00:17:49.12 --> 00:17:54.88
laments term they quit. Only 35 guys were left and Mike was one of them. He felt he was truly

189
00:17:55.44 --> 00:18:00.000
part of an elite organization a brotherhood as he looked down the line of the physical

190
00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:06.000
beast standing alongside him. He was astonished. A few candidates to his left stood none other than

191
00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:14.32
Ryan Job who was smiling. Mike and Ryan both reported to seal team three they eventually

192
00:18:14.32 --> 00:18:18.48
deployed to Ramadi. I rack where they fought in the battle of Ramadi in 2006 one of the fiercest

193
00:18:18.48 --> 00:18:22.64
battles in the global war on terror. Ryan performed as an automatic weapons machine gunner during

194
00:18:22.64 --> 00:18:27.36
the days in Ramadi. After months of fierce fighting Ryan was critically wounded during a major

195
00:18:27.36 --> 00:18:33.36
operation in South Central Ramadi contested area held by alkai to forces. You shot in the face

196
00:18:33.36 --> 00:18:38.80
by a sniper while laying down machine gun fire to cover a squad of seals closing on the enemy.

197
00:18:39.44 --> 00:18:43.20
Days after Ryan was wounded doctors declared he would never recover his sight.

198
00:18:44.40 --> 00:18:48.80
In salt to injury he also lost his sense of smell and taste but it didn't slow him down.

199
00:18:49.76 --> 00:18:54.88
After his injury Ryan displayed the same drive and resiliency he demonstrated during his days at

200
00:18:54.88 --> 00:18:59.60
buds. He refused to quit or feel sorry for himself. Despite all the setbacks he finished his

201
00:18:59.60 --> 00:19:07.36
bachelor's in business with a 4.0 GPA he ascended the 14,411 feet of Mount Ranier and even shot

202
00:19:07.36 --> 00:19:13.12
a and killed a trophy bull elk. All this without his sight, smell or taste.

203
00:19:14.40 --> 00:19:20.24
Ryan underwent countless surgeries and rehabilitation in years after Ramadi. In 2009 only a few

204
00:19:20.24 --> 00:19:25.76
weeks after he found out he and his wife his high school sweetheart would be having a baby. He

205
00:19:25.76 --> 00:19:33.68
aspirated and died during his 22nd surgery for his injuries. He became what seals call the last

206
00:19:33.68 --> 00:19:38.48
fatality of the battle of Ramadi. He was the third seal from his task unit to die.

207
00:19:40.72 --> 00:19:45.60
Fellow seal Mark Lee was the first and the second Michael Montsourer who was awarded the

208
00:19:45.60 --> 00:19:50.56
Medal of Honor for jumping on a grenade to save two seals, one of which was Mike Surelli.

209
00:19:53.68 --> 00:19:59.68
It's hard for Mike to believe now that he ever doubted Ryan. He was always waiting for a time to

210
00:19:59.68 --> 00:20:04.16
apologize and he found that time while they were in Ramadi. While they were in Ramadi.

211
00:20:04.16 --> 00:20:14.80
After Mike apologized Ryan said it's okay everyone's been misreading me all my life.

212
00:20:21.28 --> 00:20:30.000
So I don't know if there's a better example of why we can't judge a book by its cover than Ryan.

213
00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:41.60
He ended up rolling into Charlie Patoon and tasked him to bruise her and he got some personal

214
00:20:42.64 --> 00:20:50.64
love and encouragement from his Patumates to make sure that he was going to be an awesome seal.

215
00:20:50.64 --> 00:20:59.92
But this is a metaphor for what you guys see in the civilian sector with people looking at

216
00:20:59.92 --> 00:21:04.64
resumes and judging books by its cover. Same thing.

217
00:21:05.20 --> 00:21:11.04
Every day, thousands upon thousands of resumes coming in, managers like,

218
00:21:11.04 --> 00:21:16.40
this guy's been in our competitor, this person's done ABC, they have all these experience.

219
00:21:16.40 --> 00:21:21.92
Yeah, got to hire him right away. No process. I just know it. Got call.

220
00:21:23.44 --> 00:21:30.56
When everyone's talking to companies and I'll, a common question is what, what question should

221
00:21:30.56 --> 00:21:35.36
you ask during an interview? It's a pretty common question or what assessment or what should we do?

222
00:21:35.36 --> 00:21:42.24
How should we screen and I'm always saying, hey look, try and put the person in a position

223
00:21:42.24 --> 00:21:46.96
or a situation that's as similar as they're going to be working in because that's the best way to

224
00:21:46.96 --> 00:21:50.24
assess if they're going to be able to do it or not. It's a similar thing that they're doing now.

225
00:21:50.80 --> 00:21:53.52
You know, for years, they're trying to figure out who is going to make it through seal training.

226
00:21:55.12 --> 00:21:59.84
And now what they do is they send them to what is I think it's Chicago. They send them

227
00:21:59.84 --> 00:22:07.68
Chicago and they go through a pre-training situation where what they do is basically freaking train

228
00:22:07.68 --> 00:22:12.88
really, really hard and a bunch of people don't make it through that but then they find that, oh yeah,

229
00:22:12.88 --> 00:22:17.52
more people that made it through that are going to make it through actual buds. Well, it's like,

230
00:22:17.52 --> 00:22:22.80
does that not true? I've got to look at the numbers. I don't think it was a substantial increase

231
00:22:22.80 --> 00:22:26.48
in the number that actually made it through buds. But again, we've got to go back and look at the

232
00:22:26.48 --> 00:22:31.36
data. But it's the same thing with Dr. Cotton. And we see this with people who build assessments.

233
00:22:31.36 --> 00:22:36.88
We've even, it's funny you brought up trainers for the screening for Jay Sock. There were physical

234
00:22:36.88 --> 00:22:44.16
trainers that believed they could give you an 80% sort of answer on whether somebody was going to

235
00:22:44.16 --> 00:22:47.92
make it through the training or not. Everyone claims, oh well, my personal assessment test will

236
00:22:47.92 --> 00:22:52.64
give you 80% probability of whether a person will make it through the training. And it's all wrong.

237
00:22:53.52 --> 00:22:58.72
That's what's the perfect question we need to answer in the interview. We hear that all the time.

238
00:22:58.72 --> 00:23:03.68
There is no one perfect. There's no one perfect personal assessment. Some people like the

239
00:23:03.68 --> 00:23:08.16
Hogan, other people like the disc. And what you're not going to find in this book is it's not

240
00:23:08.16 --> 00:23:13.44
prescriptive. So I can be like, okay, step one. This is what you do. Step two, these are the questions

241
00:23:13.44 --> 00:23:18.08
that you need to ask. These are the personal assessments that you use. It's different for every company.

242
00:23:18.08 --> 00:23:24.40
What it is, you've got to identify your process. What's the process that works for you that

243
00:23:24.40 --> 00:23:33.28
results in statistically the most quality hiders? And that is a, as you know, that is a decade long

244
00:23:33.28 --> 00:23:38.000
pursuit and it's taking special operations. There's still redo. There's still constantly evolving

245
00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:44.56
the process. 50 decades and they're still evolving that process. So yeah, you know, we hear it all

246
00:23:44.56 --> 00:23:48.32
the time and somebody says this is the number one question I asked that determines whether somebody's

247
00:23:48.32 --> 00:23:53.68
going to work at the company or not. And if that works, we're not here to judge that's great.

248
00:23:53.68 --> 00:23:58.16
You know, we get people coming to us all the time saying, what are those questions? And I kind of

249
00:23:58.16 --> 00:24:04.08
kind of off. Like, do you know what success looks like in your company? Yeah. They're already starting

250
00:24:04.08 --> 00:24:08.56
down the interview path before they've determined what success looks like. What they're even looking

251
00:24:08.56 --> 00:24:13.44
for. Exactly. What gaps do we have? What are we trying to do here? You know, and you know,

252
00:24:13.44 --> 00:24:18.48
when I was coaching veterans and you know, Mike and I do this webinar. And I said, can any of you

253
00:24:18.48 --> 00:24:24.000
tell me a time where you've left the wire and didn't clearly know what success looked like?

254
00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:29.04
But do you watch people walk into the hiring process all the time? And they're like, okay,

255
00:24:29.04 --> 00:24:33.76
here's a list of objective requirements. I want them to come from these companies. Okay, let's

256
00:24:33.76 --> 00:24:39.52
figure out the interview questions. Yeah. Like you have a literally backwards. Yeah. So I guess this

257
00:24:39.52 --> 00:24:43.68
is going back to what I was originally starting to say that I got sidetracked on. So when I asked

258
00:24:43.68 --> 00:24:48.48
companies or people asked me, what's the question you ask? I always asked the group a question.

259
00:24:48.48 --> 00:24:54.96
I'll say, who here has ever hired someone that did the best interview. It was outstanding. You

260
00:24:54.96 --> 00:24:59.44
thought this guy was a rock star. You bring along board and they're told to disaster. And

261
00:25:00.16 --> 00:25:04.24
100% of time every single person will raise their hand because everyone has done that. We, this guy

262
00:25:04.24 --> 00:25:09.28
interviewed great, super-carol. She was terrific in the interview. All charismatic. They do a great job

263
00:25:09.28 --> 00:25:14.08
in the interview and they're duds when they show up to work. And then I asked the opposing question,

264
00:25:14.08 --> 00:25:19.76
which is, who here has looked, you needed to fill a sea, you took a risk on somebody. You

265
00:25:19.76 --> 00:25:24.56
weren't really sure it would work out. They got in there and they crushed it. And the same thing,

266
00:25:24.56 --> 00:25:32.000
everyone raises their hand. So it's a common problem and it's a common problem that we all have

267
00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:39.68
where we think we know better than life. Yeah. And I got to tell you, you know, I've been doing

268
00:25:39.68 --> 00:25:45.84
this 20 plus years and, you know, I worked for Fortune 50 Company one year. My team hired the team

269
00:25:45.84 --> 00:25:52.88
that I led hired 23,000 people in one year. So I can say from a scale perspective that I probably

270
00:25:52.88 --> 00:25:59.60
hired the more people than most on the planet. And I promise you, I've got to trust the process.

271
00:25:59.60 --> 00:26:03.28
There's no part of me that goes, oh yeah, I got that down. I know that person, yeah, they're going to

272
00:26:03.28 --> 00:26:08.40
rock it. No, no, that process. If you don't have a process and if you haven't defined success,

273
00:26:08.40 --> 00:26:13.84
hiring will humble you. You know, and you've got to approach it. And you know, one of the things

274
00:26:13.84 --> 00:26:20.88
that Mike and I went to great lengths about in this book was no process is perfect. And it's,

275
00:26:20.88 --> 00:26:26.32
you know, and one of the big things where you're talking with Josh was, you know, how do you know

276
00:26:26.32 --> 00:26:31.36
when you're doing it wrong? How do you get a feedback loop? And people just do hiring is something

277
00:26:31.36 --> 00:26:35.44
mechanical. And they don't think about this. Oh, we got to go do this. So it's outsourced and

278
00:26:35.44 --> 00:26:39.28
your HR is just okay, they're turning the cranks. And they're bringing people in the door. They're

279
00:26:39.28 --> 00:26:45.28
funneling through resumes. Yeah. But even with my years of experience, you know, you know, I'm always

280
00:26:45.28 --> 00:26:49.76
questioning myself. What am I missing? What have I missing? Did I get this right? Did I evaluate all the

281
00:26:49.76 --> 00:26:55.52
right traits for success in this role? And you know, I'm still going to miss. And I'll get humbled by it

282
00:26:55.52 --> 00:27:00.64
real quick. Every time I think I'm confident, Murphy's Law comes around and then humbles me click.

283
00:27:00.64 --> 00:27:07.28
It's an art. It's an art. There's a science behind it, but ultimately much like you can study war

284
00:27:08.40 --> 00:27:14.16
in the United States and train for a decade. But until you step into the arena of war,

285
00:27:14.16 --> 00:27:19.60
you really don't hone that art. And so you're going to make mistakes. If you have a process

286
00:27:20.64 --> 00:27:26.16
when we see the bad hires happen is when people deviate from that process and they put a time

287
00:27:26.16 --> 00:27:30.16
women on it. And we're not taking it. We're not telling anyone that you're going to take six months to

288
00:27:30.16 --> 00:27:34.72
interview somebody to hire for the job. No, we understand that it has to be within reasonable time

289
00:27:34.72 --> 00:27:39.92
on it. But you know, I know we're probably going to get to this. You can have the greatest,

290
00:27:41.12 --> 00:27:49.04
world's best talent acquisition process. You can have a great process. But if you don't have

291
00:27:49.04 --> 00:27:53.60
your leadership foundation, if it's not solid within the organization, you're going to become

292
00:27:53.60 --> 00:27:58.32
a revolving door for talent. You're going to get great people into the company and once they recognize

293
00:27:58.32 --> 00:28:02.40
that there's bad leadership, they're going to leave. So funny enough, this book, and you know,

294
00:28:02.40 --> 00:28:06.48
it's a subset. It's an important part of leadership. You actually have to start with your leadership

295
00:28:06.48 --> 00:28:11.36
foundation before you even start to build a good hiring process. And that's where a lot of people

296
00:28:11.36 --> 00:28:15.36
get it wrong. What we're lacking talent, let's just get good talent and good talent will come in.

297
00:28:15.36 --> 00:28:19.28
And again, if you're working for a bad later, that person's going to leave. What do we always say?

298
00:28:19.28 --> 00:28:26.16
You select a boss. Not a job. You select a great boss. Yeah. You say something in here too.

299
00:28:26.16 --> 00:28:31.44
It's the same thing that you're saying. It will get to it later. But if you're hiring good people,

300
00:28:31.44 --> 00:28:36.48
they don't put up with knuckleheads. They don't want to work for a knucklehead. So if you go on

301
00:28:36.48 --> 00:28:40.80
you hire someone that's awesome and you're a knucklehead or your leadership is a bunch of knuckleheads,

302
00:28:40.80 --> 00:28:44.08
they're not going to stay there. That's just the way it works. And the other thing is, you know,

303
00:28:44.08 --> 00:28:49.76
there's, you're not just like combat, you're not going to eliminate all risk when you make a

304
00:28:49.76 --> 00:28:54.80
hire. I mean, there's always going to be some level of risk there. But what you can do, if you

305
00:28:54.80 --> 00:29:00.56
set up the right process is mitigate that risk as much as humanly possible. And then you end up

306
00:29:00.56 --> 00:29:06.16
in a much better situation. Getting back to the book because damn, apparently we can all get sidetracked

307
00:29:06.16 --> 00:29:11.36
pretty quick. I guess I can nerd out on talent too, huh? A little bit. You go into this section of

308
00:29:11.36 --> 00:29:16.24
what is talent. At the most basic level talent equals high potential candidates. The people most

309
00:29:16.24 --> 00:29:21.84
likely to become high performers. Talent is people like Ryan Job. It is the individual who never

310
00:29:21.84 --> 00:29:27.36
gives up who performs in high pressure situations and who will win when others say it's impossible.

311
00:29:27.36 --> 00:29:36.64
Talent drives the team forward and talent wins. And I'm skipping forward, which, by the way,

312
00:29:36.64 --> 00:29:40.000
if this book, when I read it seems a little bit fragmented, just because I'm not reading the whole

313
00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:45.44
thing, you have to buy the book to get all the information. But I'm going to skip ahead here.

314
00:29:45.44 --> 00:29:49.68
Based on our research and interviews, we have identified nine core characteristics that

315
00:29:49.68 --> 00:29:55.12
mark an individual as having high potential. Drive. The unrelenting need for achievement and

316
00:29:55.12 --> 00:30:00.40
constant self improvement. Resiliency. The ability to persevere in the face of challenge and

317
00:30:00.40 --> 00:30:05.60
bounce back from setbacks. Adaptability. The ability to adjust according to the situation,

318
00:30:05.60 --> 00:30:11.76
learn new things, innovate and try new methods, humility. Self confidence in one's ability while

319
00:30:11.76 --> 00:30:16.48
understanding that there's always room for improvement and that others experiences and knowledge

320
00:30:16.48 --> 00:30:23.68
are valuable. Integrity and adherence to not only what is legal, but also what is right.

321
00:30:24.56 --> 00:30:29.84
Effective intelligence, the ability to apply one's knowledge to real world scenarios,

322
00:30:29.84 --> 00:30:36.24
team ability. The ability to function as part of a team placing the success of the whole above

323
00:30:36.24 --> 00:30:43.12
the needs of the self. Curiosity, a desire to explore the unknown and question the status quo

324
00:30:43.12 --> 00:30:49.28
in pursuit of better, more effective solutions. And the last one is emotional strength, a positive

325
00:30:49.28 --> 00:30:54.24
attitude, high empathy, and control over one's own emotions, especially in chaotic,

326
00:30:54.24 --> 00:31:01.04
stressful situations. These traits are heavily emphasized in special operations and explain

327
00:31:01.04 --> 00:31:06.000
why many veterans go on to accomplish incredible things in the business world after their military

328
00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:12.000
service. For instance, many companies including Johnson and Johnson with Alex Gorski FedEx,

329
00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:17.84
with Fred Smith, Bridgewater, David McCormick, and 711 Joe Depinto to name a few are run by veterans.

330
00:31:17.84 --> 00:31:25.04
These nine attributes are foundational to success no matter the industry. So when you say based on

331
00:31:25.04 --> 00:31:31.12
our research and interviews, is this stuff that Dr. Cotton kind of put forward or where do you

332
00:31:31.12 --> 00:31:36.000
guys come up with this? So it's combination of what Dr. Cotton sort of his discovery and then we

333
00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:41.04
also went and we interviewed people that ran the assessment selection for these different communities.

334
00:31:41.04 --> 00:31:47.68
Mar Sock, the Navy SEALs, the Green Berets. We worked with an amazing individual. His name is Brian Decker.

335
00:31:47.68 --> 00:31:53.20
He was a lieutenant colonel. He was in charge of the special forces assessment and selection

336
00:31:53.20 --> 00:31:58.32
process and actually sort of revolutionized it really around the concept of the whole man concept.

337
00:31:58.32 --> 00:32:04.08
And so each of these communities have a set of core attributes they're looking for. And it

338
00:32:04.08 --> 00:32:08.64
goes back really quickly. You did make a point about, you know, you hire somebody who interviews

339
00:32:08.64 --> 00:32:13.52
extremely well and they end up not working out. And that's what we call personality versus

340
00:32:13.52 --> 00:32:18.000
character. What you did was you hired based off personality and like ability and what is personality.

341
00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:24.24
That's really your external sort of show to the world where characters the inner

342
00:32:25.04 --> 00:32:31.76
attributes that drive your behaviors. And we say all fall in for that. It's like your customer facing

343
00:32:31.76 --> 00:32:37.84
self versus your internal facing self. Exactly. And you know one of the things we we talk about in the

344
00:32:37.84 --> 00:32:41.60
book is like the last thing you want to hire for. And then people get this, you know, this

345
00:32:41.60 --> 00:32:46.40
culture fit. Are they a culture fit? And it sort of becomes this just ad hoc term they throw out

346
00:32:46.40 --> 00:32:52.000
but they don't really understand. And when people say culture fit, a lot of times what they mean is

347
00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:57.28
do I like this person. And what we talk about in the book is that some of the the most high

348
00:32:57.28 --> 00:33:02.56
performing seals that I served with and you served with. I didn't like weird professionals and

349
00:33:02.56 --> 00:33:06.64
worked well together. But when the job was done he went and hung out with his inner circle and I

350
00:33:06.64 --> 00:33:12.24
went and hung with mine. But like ability for professionals is not a requirement. Now if you

351
00:33:12.24 --> 00:33:16.96
guys just conflict and it creates a toxic culture that's a different thing but the least important

352
00:33:16.96 --> 00:33:22.32
thing to me was like ability. If the individual performs and he can actually put his self needs

353
00:33:22.32 --> 00:33:27.28
a side or her self needs a side for the common good of the team that's somebody that can be part of

354
00:33:27.28 --> 00:33:35.84
the culture. As long as their values align with our culture. They're ethical. Yeah, I mean I think

355
00:33:35.84 --> 00:33:42.64
here's the deal on that from my perspective. If there's someone that works hard and is there to

356
00:33:42.64 --> 00:33:51.28
support the team, I like them. You know they like I don't know anyone that has here's the

357
00:33:51.28 --> 00:33:58.56
interesting. I know people that have good personalities and bad character they exist but I don't

358
00:33:58.56 --> 00:34:02.56
know of anyone. And so I might not like someone that has a good personality but you know and you

359
00:34:02.56 --> 00:34:07.12
can think when I think of these people I just think of famous people. There's all these famous people

360
00:34:07.12 --> 00:34:11.28
that they have these personalities and then they then all of a sudden the story breaks that they're

361
00:34:11.28 --> 00:34:17.84
told their backs. And whatever they've got to most heinous things going on in their personal lives.

362
00:34:17.84 --> 00:34:22.000
So you've got that where someone has a good personality they're they're forward facing

363
00:34:22.88 --> 00:34:26.000
personalities who are positive but then behind closed doors they're scumbags.

364
00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:33.60
And but if you flip that over I can't think of anybody that has a good character that they're

365
00:34:33.60 --> 00:34:40.08
a good character but they're a bad but they have a bad personality. I don't it's hard for me to think

366
00:34:40.08 --> 00:34:46.56
about. Now is there someone that maybe has a has a good character and there there maybe

367
00:34:46.56 --> 00:34:51.92
two director or maybe they're maybe they don't talk a lot or you know whatever but but normally

368
00:34:51.92 --> 00:34:54.80
if they've got a if they're he goes and check and they're they're gonna support the team.

369
00:34:54.80 --> 00:35:03.76
I mean I can't. Yeah it's pretty rare. Yeah but a better way but is there were people that were

370
00:35:03.76 --> 00:35:09.28
high performers that were just sort of socially awkward. So maybe they were just like they were too

371
00:35:09.28 --> 00:35:14.56
direct. Right. It burned sometimes bridges you understood their personality but other people didn't.

372
00:35:15.28 --> 00:35:20.48
Back to the attributes so Brian Decker is now the director of player development for the

373
00:35:20.48 --> 00:35:25.92
Indianapolis cults and so took what he learned in special forces assessment selection he's now

374
00:35:25.92 --> 00:35:29.28
applying it he's been in the NFL he's worked for for two teams for about six years.

375
00:35:30.32 --> 00:35:36.08
When they revolutionized and you know it pains me to say this but I can put my ego aside.

376
00:35:36.64 --> 00:35:43.04
The special forces army special forces community was much further ahead in terms of creating a

377
00:35:43.76 --> 00:35:49.84
structured and professionalized assessment of how they select special forces soldiers into the

378
00:35:49.84 --> 00:35:55.92
community. Seals it was just sort of this oral history passed down and when I went over there

379
00:35:55.92 --> 00:35:59.92
as a guest instructor at their phase two which is their small unit training that's when I was

380
00:35:59.92 --> 00:36:04.72
really exposed to their whole process and this thing called the whole man concept and the fact

381
00:36:04.72 --> 00:36:09.52
that they were looking for specific attributes. So when they redesigned their their assessment

382
00:36:09.52 --> 00:36:16.24
selection they created tasks much like an interview process where they're trying to elicit

383
00:36:16.24 --> 00:36:21.84
certain behaviors whether good or bad and that's what they're looking for. And so that translates

384
00:36:21.84 --> 00:36:26.96
to companies it doesn't matter you know what your interview process is or if you have written

385
00:36:26.96 --> 00:36:32.64
tests what you're trying to elicit with every every question should have meaning behind it

386
00:36:32.64 --> 00:36:38.56
in an interview process and ultimately that question has to drive at behaviors that's

387
00:36:38.56 --> 00:36:42.96
and people call this you know in the civilian world behavioral interviews. They're one of the best

388
00:36:42.96 --> 00:36:50.32
techniques if you do it well. Yeah the the German Army. Yeah as they were trying to get their

389
00:36:51.20 --> 00:36:58.24
their officers to step up and implement decentralized command and be able to make moves.

390
00:36:58.24 --> 00:37:02.40
One of the things that I've read about they would do is they would give them here's the rules

391
00:37:02.40 --> 00:37:07.92
that you have to follow for this training operation and the only way that they could actually

392
00:37:07.92 --> 00:37:13.44
successfully complete the mission would be to break the rules. And so it was a test to see if they

393
00:37:13.44 --> 00:37:18.24
would break the rules in order to accomplish the mission. And then there was and look even if

394
00:37:18.24 --> 00:37:23.76
if you didn't break the rules it didn't necessarily mean that you were a bad person. It just

395
00:37:23.76 --> 00:37:29.52
would now we know more about you right now I know more about you and we got into some of this on

396
00:37:29.52 --> 00:37:36.96
when it up at Gettysburg for you have battlefield. You know the fact that Lee didn't know his

397
00:37:36.96 --> 00:37:43.28
his two subordinates as well as he had before Jackson died. So he's talking to you all and he's

398
00:37:43.28 --> 00:37:47.12
telling you all that he wants to do something but he's not knowing well he doesn't know his personality

399
00:37:47.12 --> 00:37:52.32
well enough. So when he tells you hey take that thing if you can't take that hill if you can and

400
00:37:52.32 --> 00:37:56.88
you'll go to the other and says well I can't. He code of it just wouldn't have been a gut check.

401
00:37:56.88 --> 00:38:02.96
And if you would have told Jackson to take that hill Jackson would have taken that hill. So these

402
00:38:02.96 --> 00:38:09.36
are this idea behind setting up questions or situations or problems that you have to solve that

403
00:38:09.36 --> 00:38:16.16
reveal some part of your character is a very cool thing. You know when you mentioned earlier about

404
00:38:16.16 --> 00:38:21.92
when people come to you and ask what's the best interview question the question back to them is

405
00:38:21.92 --> 00:38:25.76
how are you screening for character. And it's one of the things we go into this book is that

406
00:38:25.76 --> 00:38:33.76
most of those questions are about experience. Do you have this objective experience? They're not

407
00:38:33.76 --> 00:38:38.88
screening for character. And so you know with the research that we did with Dr. Justin Cotton brought

408
00:38:38.88 --> 00:38:45.20
to us and when we figured these out you know our point is is that you know once you meet that simple

409
00:38:45.20 --> 00:38:50.80
experiential gate when you've got the basics you need to start screening for character and you go

410
00:38:50.80 --> 00:38:57.44
company by company by company and and I and I hate in some ways to say this because I see it all the time

411
00:38:57.44 --> 00:39:03.36
which is executives are almost the worst of this picking other executives and they don't screen

412
00:39:03.36 --> 00:39:08.24
for character they're looking for it. Did you work at the competition? How did you move the revenue?

413
00:39:08.24 --> 00:39:13.60
How did you improve customer success? How did you move a product along? They don't go down into

414
00:39:13.60 --> 00:39:18.72
character and I sat in the interview after interview after interview and it and it's all objective

415
00:39:18.72 --> 00:39:25.04
traits or you know basic subjective traits that don't go deep into character and that's what's missing.

416
00:39:28.48 --> 00:39:35.28
People will default to objective things because they're measurable. They're easy. It's the easy

417
00:39:35.28 --> 00:39:41.28
button. The subjective is what's hard. He talked about defining success. You know one of the

418
00:39:41.28 --> 00:39:45.76
mistakes we see with company students they just have one interview process across the organization.

419
00:39:45.76 --> 00:39:52.48
You actually have to create talent profiles for each of the roles and functions in levels of

420
00:39:52.48 --> 00:39:57.20
and that's why it takes a lot of time. So what's going to make a great engineer in a company

421
00:39:58.08 --> 00:40:02.64
is vastly different from what makes a great salesperson. So a lot of the times

422
00:40:02.64 --> 00:40:06.80
why companies don't define success and they're not good at the interview process is they haven't

423
00:40:06.80 --> 00:40:11.44
take the time to create talent profiles for the different levels and the different functions

424
00:40:11.44 --> 00:40:17.36
within the community. It's much like a seal. The attributes that make a great seal are vastly different

425
00:40:17.36 --> 00:40:24.08
than the attributes for special operations direct support in Intel officer or someone handling the logistics.

426
00:40:24.08 --> 00:40:28.000
And we've gotten smarter about that over the years as well. And what a lot of people don't understand

427
00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:33.04
is we're not only screening the green berets and the Navy seals or also screening the people

428
00:40:33.60 --> 00:40:37.36
that provide the support to those organizations that ultimately come under our umbrella. They're

429
00:40:37.36 --> 00:40:42.96
being screened for specific attributes as well. Think about the attributes of a good point man versus

430
00:40:42.96 --> 00:40:48.96
a good breacher. Right? This is like two guys in the same food but you know that breacher attitude

431
00:40:48.96 --> 00:40:53.20
versus a point man attitude. That's even those guys are a little bit different and they kind of

432
00:40:53.20 --> 00:40:58.08
get picked when you show up at the team. You know some little guy that's sneaky point man.

433
00:40:58.08 --> 00:41:05.52
Some big freaking bruiser walking around breacher. So let me throw this out. You often see that

434
00:41:05.52 --> 00:41:12.56
bachelor's degree is a requirement and a lot of companies can articulate that. Yeah why?

435
00:41:12.56 --> 00:41:17.76
Why is that even a requirement? In a not saying it you know it does show somebody took the

436
00:41:18.96 --> 00:41:22.96
the initiative to go complete their bachelor's degree or a master's and I understand that but

437
00:41:23.84 --> 00:41:29.44
he's got a great story about when C++ programming came along and I'll let him tell it

438
00:41:29.44 --> 00:41:36.72
but yeah just embarrassing for the people that were requesting a coder. Yeah I had it. It was

439
00:41:36.72 --> 00:41:41.68
actually Python was the language that they were coding in and I had a senior engineer come to

440
00:41:41.68 --> 00:41:45.12
me and say hey George you gotta go find me somebody with five years of Python experience.

441
00:41:47.28 --> 00:41:51.20
I'm like whoa we can't do that. He's like well why not?

442
00:41:51.92 --> 00:41:56.000
He said it's only been around three years and you might have not knocked that requirement back

443
00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:04.96
down to three but it's scary that he was so wired to getting an objective level of experience that

444
00:42:04.96 --> 00:42:10.72
he didn't relate to the job and was completely arbitrary and wasn't timed any measure of success.

445
00:42:11.44 --> 00:42:16.08
So I mean we calibrated him really quickly we got somebody that had spent most of their you know

446
00:42:16.80 --> 00:42:23.20
the last few years doing Python you know coding but you know working with that language but it

447
00:42:23.20 --> 00:42:28.88
was shocking that it came from an engineer. Yeah you gotta watch out for that one.

448
00:42:31.20 --> 00:42:36.40
Going back to the book the importance of a talent mindset and this is this is sort of a thread

449
00:42:36.40 --> 00:42:41.60
that goes throughout the book. A talent mindset is the deep belief that human capital is the single

450
00:42:41.60 --> 00:42:46.56
most important competitive advantage your company can have. When a company has talent mindset

451
00:42:46.56 --> 00:42:54.000
assessing, selecting and developing the best talent is a top priority. A talent mindset not only

452
00:42:54.000 --> 00:43:00.40
accounts for hiring talented people but also includes the continual development and investment

453
00:43:00.40 --> 00:43:07.76
in that talent through their tenure in the organization. So beyond just bringing people on board it's

454
00:43:09.20 --> 00:43:15.52
continuing to grow them and make them better. So we call the high potential. When you're going through

455
00:43:15.52 --> 00:43:19.84
the interview process to select new seals in when they graduate buds are they had performers?

456
00:43:21.04 --> 00:43:25.44
They're not yet. They haven't been proven. They they passed the first gate. That gate is closed.

457
00:43:26.08 --> 00:43:31.76
They are high potentials. So even if you're looking for a frontline trooper frontline employee or a

458
00:43:31.76 --> 00:43:35.04
brand new CEO when you bring them into the organization. If you made that decision that they're going

459
00:43:35.04 --> 00:43:40.32
to be part of the team even if that he's been a prior CEO in another company he's a high potential

460
00:43:40.32 --> 00:43:44.48
within that new organization. He's not proven yet. So in order to turn that person from a high

461
00:43:44.48 --> 00:43:47.92
potential I mean this this is what we do for a living in national unfrient. Now you have to

462
00:43:47.92 --> 00:43:52.56
develop them and that takes a lot of time and effort and it never stops. And if you want to turn

463
00:43:52.56 --> 00:43:57.68
that high potential into a high performer it's again it's you have to pour in and invest in those

464
00:43:57.68 --> 00:44:03.60
people and that's why special operations was sort of the the foundational organization we focused

465
00:44:03.60 --> 00:44:08.56
on in this book because they do it so well. At the core of what you know makes special operations

466
00:44:08.56 --> 00:44:13.36
so special it's their fundamental belief that people are everything and of course when we say

467
00:44:13.36 --> 00:44:17.60
people you're also talking about leadership. And then you know you look it's one of the things we

468
00:44:17.60 --> 00:44:23.84
drive through in the book that Talon mindset is that everything changes so rapidly today. Technology

469
00:44:23.84 --> 00:44:30.80
the economy markets companies you're only true competitive advantage is talent and that's what we're

470
00:44:30.80 --> 00:44:37.60
trying to convey is that it isn't the hardware in special operations it's the people and and that's

471
00:44:37.60 --> 00:44:43.92
how it's got to be in corporate America and it's got to be where you treat your human capital with

472
00:44:43.92 --> 00:44:49.52
the same rigor and the same focus that you treat your financial capital. And time and again Mike

473
00:44:49.52 --> 00:44:54.16
and I see that you know of course revenue, here's all people are focused on revenue they're not

474
00:44:54.16 --> 00:45:03.92
focused on the human capital which is driving everything. You get into this section chapter two what's

475
00:45:03.92 --> 00:45:09.76
so wrong with traditional hiring practices. George Feld has if you'd want a lottery for a career

476
00:45:10.48 --> 00:45:14.72
through a highly selective veteran hiring group you just been offered a position at one of the

477
00:45:14.72 --> 00:45:20.08
world's largest big box retailers according to the company representative they were looking for

478
00:45:20.08 --> 00:45:25.76
driven leaders who know new how to mentor lead and provide vision for people. Sounded like the

479
00:45:25.76 --> 00:45:30.88
perfect fit for George plus the job included good salary stock options and growth opportunity.

480
00:45:30.88 --> 00:45:35.52
It was George's first civilian job after nearly a decade of active duty service and we'd

481
00:45:35.52 --> 00:45:40.56
set him up to be able to go anywhere and do anything. George accepted the job his very first day of

482
00:45:40.56 --> 00:45:46.72
orientation training and onboarding was like a punch in the gut. Nothing was about talent or

483
00:45:46.72 --> 00:45:50.40
leadership. The position was none of the things they'd advertised or told him they didn't want

484
00:45:50.40 --> 00:45:54.000
a leader they wanted someone who'd fill vacant positions as quickly as possible with people who

485
00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:59.52
did hear strictly to the rules they were looking for cogs and a machine not talent. Accordingly

486
00:45:59.52 --> 00:46:03.84
their recruiting teams were evaluated based on efficiency their speed of filling vacant roles and

487
00:46:03.84 --> 00:46:08.72
cost per hire. To say it was a bad fit was a gross understatement nevertheless George soon proved

488
00:46:08.72 --> 00:46:14.80
himself to be a high performer and was promoted. His new role still wasn't a good fit fit so we applied

489
00:46:14.80 --> 00:46:19.76
for another position within the company he felt he would be more suitable. Despite exceeding all

490
00:46:19.76 --> 00:46:24.88
this key performance indicators and being ranked in the top 5% of his divisional employees the company

491
00:46:24.88 --> 00:46:29.28
refused to move him. He was succeeding in a leadership role that others struggled with so the

492
00:46:29.28 --> 00:46:35.04
company wanted to keep him there. George made it 20 months before he quit. He wasn't the only one who

493
00:46:35.04 --> 00:46:40.96
had to leave quickly. Several peers who shared his talent mindset let also left within two years.

494
00:46:40.96 --> 00:46:45.28
George and his peers had been able to transform and improve their small assigned corners of the

495
00:46:45.28 --> 00:46:49.44
company but as soon as they left everything reverted back to the status quo. A tradition went up

496
00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:55.04
and all the KPIs went unmet. George learned a lot of valuable lessons from that big box retailer

497
00:46:55.04 --> 00:46:59.92
primarily in what not to do which can be as important to knowing what to do. There was a first hand

498
00:46:59.92 --> 00:47:05.20
look at how broken traditional talent acquisition is. The mistakes this organization made are the

499
00:47:05.20 --> 00:47:10.64
same ones we see companies make again and again. And here they are lacking a talent mindset not

500
00:47:10.64 --> 00:47:15.28
understanding how HR should be structured to drive impact, having a butts and seats mentality,

501
00:47:15.28 --> 00:47:21.52
participating in fear-based hiring and settling for mediocrity. Anyone of these mistakes

502
00:47:21.52 --> 00:47:26.96
and spelled disaster foreign organization but the most destructive mistake is missing the talent mindset.

503
00:47:28.88 --> 00:47:33.60
Rough first tour out of the military huh? It was. It was and you know I've got a four-year

504
00:47:33.60 --> 00:47:38.80
old my wife's pregnant when I'm thinking okay I've had a great career. The things that made me

505
00:47:38.80 --> 00:47:42.48
successful in the military they're going to make me successful in the corporate world and I'm just

506
00:47:42.48 --> 00:47:48.48
fired up. You know young don't know what I don't know and use one of those veteran firms and

507
00:47:48.48 --> 00:47:58.08
oh I landed job. You know what I think is interesting about that is I bet that many people here

508
00:47:58.08 --> 00:48:04.72
oh you've got a guy that's been in the military for 10 years. What he wants and what he expects

509
00:48:05.92 --> 00:48:09.20
this is someone that doesn't it hasn't been in the military what he wants and what he expects is

510
00:48:10.24 --> 00:48:16.16
to be told what to do and then follow the protocol as has been as you're told and staying your box

511
00:48:16.16 --> 00:48:21.92
and anyone that's in the bend in the military knows that that's not how the military operates

512
00:48:21.92 --> 00:48:25.60
at least that's not how it should operate. So you go into that position they think oh cool we've got a

513
00:48:25.60 --> 00:48:33.28
cog here that we can just count on to you know run the numbers whatever follow the daily program

514
00:48:33.76 --> 00:48:38.48
when in reality what does a military individual want to do wants to improve things wants to make

515
00:48:38.48 --> 00:48:42.56
things better wants to grow wants to get more efficient wants to want to push and improve that's what we

516
00:48:42.56 --> 00:48:47.76
want to do and all of a sudden you're trapped in a situation where no don't do that. Oh yeah I was

517
00:48:48.48 --> 00:48:56.000
sitting there and you walk in the first day and I'm like what happened what did I miss how did I

518
00:48:56.000 --> 00:49:01.04
miss this you the other thing they wanted rule followers you know this is a big box retail or

519
00:49:01.04 --> 00:49:05.36
we won't we go to great likes we do not name any of these companies but I walk in the door

520
00:49:05.36 --> 00:49:10.88
everybody would know this one and they're expecting me to execute very specific rules I mean

521
00:49:10.88 --> 00:49:16.96
it they had a more manuals for the same task than the United States Army does it was it was

522
00:49:16.96 --> 00:49:21.44
phenomenal and that's impressive that's very impressive how you pull that off you want to know how to

523
00:49:21.44 --> 00:49:26.40
do something there's a there's a binder up there and you know this is this is before everything

524
00:49:26.40 --> 00:49:32.72
you know on on your iPads and on your computer and they wanted rule followers and immediately

525
00:49:32.72 --> 00:49:36.96
I knew that was wrong because to your point the one thing that I would add is you know military

526
00:49:36.96 --> 00:49:43.04
people come out want to win they want to make a difference they want to make an impact and so when

527
00:49:43.04 --> 00:49:49.44
you're looking at a company and you know you see this this big name and I got to be honest another

528
00:49:49.44 --> 00:49:54.72
way I got humbled was those stock options looked really really good when I came out I'm like

529
00:49:54.72 --> 00:50:00.08
who I've got equity I got something I would never get otherwise but they want to rule followers and

530
00:50:00.08 --> 00:50:05.84
and so there was no there were no latitude you know when I work my commanders you know everybody

531
00:50:05.84 --> 00:50:11.60
I work with they give me my left and right limits but they also entrust me to make good solid

532
00:50:11.60 --> 00:50:16.000
decisions that take care by people if I need to exceed that left and right limit and I communicate

533
00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:22.40
those things but I got here and it's literally you're in a really really small box and you you go

534
00:50:22.40 --> 00:50:28.64
from thinking that you're going to be wildly successful and to be honest with you I was because I don't

535
00:50:28.64 --> 00:50:33.12
care what you're going to throw at me I'm going to figure it out and and and I did but it was just

536
00:50:33.12 --> 00:50:37.84
missing so many things and veterans crave being able to make you were just making a difference

537
00:50:37.84 --> 00:50:42.48
of the service now you want to make a difference in the corporate world and you know I was kind

538
00:50:42.48 --> 00:50:47.44
of almost ashamed to come back tell my wife honey I think I made a mistake you know when she's

539
00:50:47.44 --> 00:50:52.000
even it's pregnant that was not coming out of my mouth you know I was just like okay I got to

540
00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:56.64
figure this stuff out but yeah bad fit yeah and just to make sure I clarify this point

541
00:50:56.64 --> 00:51:04.56
to say that military people we're not saying that military people are not rule followers

542
00:51:04.56 --> 00:51:09.52
correct and look in the military you follow all kinds of rules from the way you cut your hair

543
00:51:09.52 --> 00:51:15.28
to the way you've freaking wear your clothing like you follow rules but there's there's another

544
00:51:15.28 --> 00:51:20.24
level of this and as a leader the last thing I look I as a leader I wanted people that followed

545
00:51:20.24 --> 00:51:26.16
rules and here's the key point as long as the rules made sense and the rules didn't make sense

546
00:51:26.16 --> 00:51:30.40
I wanted my guys to come to me and say hey you know what jockel this thing that we're supposed to be

547
00:51:30.40 --> 00:51:34.88
doing it doesn't make any sense and here's why I don't want people that blindly follow rules that

548
00:51:34.88 --> 00:51:38.96
don't make sense if there's rules in place there's a good reason for them absolutely military guys are

549
00:51:38.96 --> 00:51:45.20
great military guys and men and women are great at taking a protocol and exercising that

550
00:51:45.20 --> 00:51:51.28
protocol and we have the discipline to and the mindset to get that done but what's even more important

551
00:51:51.28 --> 00:51:57.68
than that is having the mind to look at a problem look at a situation look at a protocol and say

552
00:51:57.68 --> 00:52:03.84
wait a second we can make this better we can do this more efficiently that's what that's not only

553
00:52:03.84 --> 00:52:08.88
what we do but it's what we want to do do what drives us because like you said we want to win

554
00:52:09.60 --> 00:52:15.28
yeah and you want to and you know and and and Mike and I try to do this with each other and you

555
00:52:15.28 --> 00:52:20.08
want to empower the people that work for you that you're leading to do the very same thing

556
00:52:20.08 --> 00:52:24.56
to say hey you've got a good idea and I brought a phrase from the two of you the best idea

557
00:52:24.56 --> 00:52:29.36
wins you come up with an idea it makes sense you know it's not illegal it's not a moral it's not

558
00:52:29.36 --> 00:52:33.68
an ethical and it's going to drive revenue or improve something hey let's get after let's go do it

559
00:52:34.24 --> 00:52:40.64
I came up with an idea that I figured out in one year would do two million dollars in operating

560
00:52:40.64 --> 00:52:49.20
cost reduction and the answer was is it in the book like well no and neither is the two million

561
00:52:49.20 --> 00:52:55.44
dollars by the way and it was still no and and you know that's kind of the environment where

562
00:52:55.44 --> 00:52:59.76
military leader goes okay I'm not going to reach my potential here I'm not going to be able to do

563
00:52:59.76 --> 00:53:04.24
all the things that I want to do and and you know it was challenged because you know I don't want to

564
00:53:04.24 --> 00:53:09.60
quit anything but you sometimes have to make those hard decisions in your career to say yeah

565
00:53:09.60 --> 00:53:16.96
I could impact better somewhere else and I did this supports something that I tell people all the time

566
00:53:16.96 --> 00:53:24.56
that the most important compensation you can give a human being is freedom and autonomy and

567
00:53:24.56 --> 00:53:28.56
and what that means is ownership ownership over your own destiny and if people like that's a

568
00:53:28.56 --> 00:53:33.84
classic example here you were you're getting good money you had good stock options you're crushing

569
00:53:33.84 --> 00:53:42.16
the job which means it's not like it's a tax on your mental power but none of that was compare another

570
00:53:42.16 --> 00:53:46.56
that none of that was had enough value to make you stay there exactly whereas if you were to had

571
00:53:46.56 --> 00:53:52.56
autonomy and freedom and the ability to control your own fate and destiny you'd still be there

572
00:53:52.56 --> 00:53:56.88
right now we wouldn't be having this conversation you'd be running the company yeah exactly

573
00:53:56.88 --> 00:54:03.52
and you know it's spot on and I came into a company two years ago and then I concertally

574
00:54:03.52 --> 00:54:10.000
named the company force point which is a room by Raytheon but a cybersecurity company and

575
00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:17.20
that's what the CEO and the CHRO gave me at that company and what's interesting is we put an

576
00:54:17.20 --> 00:54:22.000
ethos a marker in the ground for the entire team it was teamwork ownership humility

577
00:54:23.04 --> 00:54:27.20
turned around the entire I mean we walked into a dumpster fire frankly so when we walked into

578
00:54:27.92 --> 00:54:32.88
and we were able to do great things but that that value in that ownership that they gave me

579
00:54:32.88 --> 00:54:37.84
that I was able to give everybody on my team it's everything and so when you come into this

580
00:54:37.84 --> 00:54:43.92
moment's reconciliation becomes an issue that value that empowerment that ownership you give

581
00:54:43.92 --> 00:54:51.44
people they stick and in two years we had zero percent attrition wow is that you know what's

582
00:54:51.44 --> 00:54:57.92
amazing though is that that's a surprise to people and you know I'm kind of sitting back going how can

583
00:54:57.92 --> 00:55:06.64
that be so so much of a surprise that giving somebody ownership and trust and value is everything

584
00:55:06.64 --> 00:55:11.12
the most important thing the best form of compensation and the reason I've been able to tell

585
00:55:11.12 --> 00:55:16.48
that to clients at Ashland front is I say look I had people that you knew in the Sealteams

586
00:55:16.48 --> 00:55:22.96
in the military in the Navy if you're doing the best job you know three times better than anyone

587
00:55:22.96 --> 00:55:29.92
else in your opportunity I can't give you a raise okay like I can give you a good evaluation and then

588
00:55:29.92 --> 00:55:37.20
in two years you'll be eligible for promotion and then you'll get an extra $270 a month no one's

589
00:55:37.20 --> 00:55:43.12
doing three acts to work because of that but what can you give someone freedom and if you worked

590
00:55:43.12 --> 00:55:48.88
for me and you were square away you pretty much did whatever you wanted to do and then and I would just

591
00:55:48.88 --> 00:55:52.96
do nothing but provide cover fire for you if you weren't square away is a totally different

592
00:55:52.96 --> 00:55:55.84
ballgame you're going to put in a box and you weren't going to be able to maneuver at all because

593
00:55:55.84 --> 00:56:03.04
you're doing things wrong so the best way to retain your talent is great leadership and it goes

594
00:56:03.04 --> 00:56:07.68
back to bufre we just did he have battlefield the guysburg you know he operated within the spirit

595
00:56:08.32 --> 00:56:13.92
of the commanders intent and actually deviated from what was the plan because he saw an opportunity

596
00:56:13.92 --> 00:56:18.96
I think what the Marine Corps calls it took authority on demand and made calls that ultimately made the

597
00:56:18.96 --> 00:56:25.60
union army you know victorious over the the Confederates you know you did say something about

598
00:56:25.60 --> 00:56:31.36
and we deal with this with you have a watch is for some companies it's a mental leap

599
00:56:32.08 --> 00:56:37.36
to hire a military leader into a senior management role when they're coming fresh out of the military

600
00:56:38.16 --> 00:56:44.000
and it's usually because of those perceptions are shaped by what the movies

601
00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:49.84
100% the water you guys I mean you follow orders that it's 100% the cogs in the wheel

602
00:56:50.48 --> 00:56:56.96
is shaped by movies and we literally have that conversation you know especially during COVID

603
00:56:58.40 --> 00:57:03.12
we've seen that a lot of organizations did not select the right leaders coming in the

604
00:57:03.12 --> 00:57:08.40
organization that were not able to innovate in the depth that were not able to handle the chaos

605
00:57:08.40 --> 00:57:15.76
could not remain calm and we're unable or ill-equipped for crisis and what we have to educate

606
00:57:15.76 --> 00:57:23.28
them about these men and women coming out is you know one they are generalists but generalists are

607
00:57:23.28 --> 00:57:31.84
much more powerful than specialists in fact one of the quotes from Brian Decker in this is that

608
00:57:31.84 --> 00:57:36.80
we've over specialized some of the roles in the private sector it's no longer good enough that

609
00:57:36.80 --> 00:57:43.28
you're an ear doctor you now have to be a left ear doctor and you know while I understand that

610
00:57:43.28 --> 00:57:47.12
that is requirement for certain roles if it's a very technical position yes technical skills are

611
00:57:47.12 --> 00:57:52.48
required but in general management roles which are usually your top leadership roles in a company

612
00:57:53.12 --> 00:58:01.04
generalists are more equipped to lead and this is why because they they draw from a broader base

613
00:58:01.04 --> 00:58:05.36
of experiences I mean you've been all run around the world in the military you've dealt with

614
00:58:05.36 --> 00:58:10.88
different cultures you've dealt with different problems such you have this vast array of experiences

615
00:58:10.88 --> 00:58:14.72
where a lot of the the business leaders that have never left the United States do not

616
00:58:15.44 --> 00:58:22.96
and we're finding that that that that experience has not only prepared them but it's the

617
00:58:22.96 --> 00:58:26.32
fact that there are a lot of these military that are stepping into the roles the ones we place

618
00:58:26.32 --> 00:58:30.88
are being highly successful they're performing when they step in of course there's a learning curve

619
00:58:30.88 --> 00:58:36.16
but the learning agility for the the men and women that we place is extremely high that's one of the

620
00:58:36.16 --> 00:58:42.24
things we're screening for Eddie if I've watched is that yeah into intellectual horsepower matters

621
00:58:42.24 --> 00:58:49.44
it does but once that gates closed these people are placed and it's it's been phenomenal I mean

622
00:58:49.44 --> 00:58:53.12
you met something the the clients at the eF battlefield they're like the best higher ever

623
00:58:53.68 --> 00:58:58.80
yeah the the train ability you know if you've been in the military you know how to learn

624
00:58:58.80 --> 00:59:03.44
you start learning stuff out of the gate and you learn how to learn very well and so that's why

625
00:59:03.44 --> 00:59:07.84
when someone comes without the skill set in the civilian sector they can learn that skill set very

626
00:59:07.84 --> 00:59:13.12
quickly because they've been learning all these different skill sets for eight years 12 years 20

627
00:59:13.12 --> 00:59:19.84
years 25 years that's what we do in the military it's a new stuff all the time going here section

628
00:59:19.84 --> 00:59:25.84
called the cost of talent when companies lack a talent mindset it's a common refrain cost creating

629
00:59:25.84 --> 00:59:30.32
a robust talent acquisition and management process is simply too costly they say what most

630
00:59:30.32 --> 00:59:36.40
companies don't understand is the major cost is not money but time and devotion to creating a

631
00:59:36.40 --> 00:59:42.72
world class talent acquisition pipeline in the process you will actually save money in the long run

632
00:59:42.72 --> 00:59:47.52
as your tuition lowers and you consistently make better hires the special operations community

633
00:59:47.52 --> 00:59:53.20
has long understood that people are everything special operations soldiers go through three main stages

634
00:59:53.20 --> 00:59:59.92
assessment and selection training and combat and war and then you guys break this out so in special

635
00:59:59.92 --> 01:00:04.32
operations it's called assessment and selection in business it's called talent acquisition

636
01:00:04.32 --> 01:00:09.04
or the hiring process and special operations it's called training in business it's called talent

637
01:00:09.04 --> 01:00:14.000
management and leadership development and then in special operations called combat and war

638
01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:19.52
and in business it's called business sales marketing production whatever is that you're doing it's a

639
01:00:19.52 --> 01:00:27.36
pretty good little break out there of how similar these things really are going in another section

640
01:00:27.36 --> 01:00:33.12
here may companies have a fundamental misalignment between upper leadership and HR where leadership says

641
01:00:33.12 --> 01:00:40.24
they want talent but HR is not set up to actually hire for talent in fact HR often doesn't even

642
01:00:40.24 --> 01:00:45.20
know what talent looks like in the company there's no gold standard of talent instead hiring

643
01:00:45.20 --> 01:00:50.88
is mechanical order taking process based on objective requirements leadership gives HR a laundry list of

644
01:00:50.88 --> 01:00:56.96
what they want years of experience required skill set compensation range and HR goes out and fills the

645
01:00:56.96 --> 01:01:03.76
order to have effective talent acquisition your business leaders and HR department must be strategic

646
01:01:03.76 --> 01:01:09.28
partners the talent acquisition team must be students of the business understanding the organizations

647
01:01:09.28 --> 01:01:16.40
underlying goals and talent needed to achieve them since day one in my career Joe DePento told us

648
01:01:16.96 --> 01:01:23.60
and that's the CEO of 711 I've always had my CHRO linked at the hip and will continue to

649
01:01:24.16 --> 01:01:30.24
as Joe is discovered to function strategically your HR department must be a part of the planning

650
01:01:30.24 --> 01:01:36.40
process for both talent acquisition and management HR should be involved in succession planning

651
01:01:36.40 --> 01:01:44.08
and gap analysis to assess select and develop talent in a strategic way you know we

652
01:01:44.08 --> 01:01:53.36
we found this you know I kind of knew it intuitively and I suspected it but when we did the research

653
01:01:53.36 --> 01:02:02.32
chief human resource officers are often paid one third of their C-suite counterparts that's where it

654
01:02:02.32 --> 01:02:09.60
starts could you imagine for a second that your your mechanics and your medics were paid a third

655
01:02:10.16 --> 01:02:14.32
of what you make because they're not frontline could you imagine what that would look like in

656
01:02:14.32 --> 01:02:23.04
special operations in any military unit and that's where it starts and and HR is not a strategic

657
01:02:23.04 --> 01:02:28.80
function and you know I had the benefit of coming up with this mentor and somebody who really

658
01:02:28.80 --> 01:02:36.08
empowered me in her name is Tracy Kio and she is the CHRO of Heal of Packard and she's just absolutely

659
01:02:36.08 --> 01:02:40.88
amazing you know we put this quote in the book because to this day it's still it's one of the reasons

660
01:02:40.88 --> 01:02:47.76
that I've stated my function for so long and she went to an executive meeting one day and they're like

661
01:02:47.76 --> 01:02:52.72
hey you know Tracy it's good to have HR at the table she kind of sneaker'd look back to them and

662
01:02:52.72 --> 01:02:59.04
she's she is a very strong leader and she says we are the table and I was like you know what that's

663
01:02:59.04 --> 01:03:03.28
that's right and that's the theme throughout this book is the people or everything so when you

664
01:03:03.28 --> 01:03:09.36
start out deprioratizing your chief human resources officer and you make this an administrative

665
01:03:09.36 --> 01:03:16.24
function or an operational function you know how do you ever expect to get the best talent and talents

666
01:03:16.24 --> 01:03:19.52
which are having your product talents what's driving your service talents in front of your

667
01:03:19.52 --> 01:03:24.72
customers talent is driving your revenue that's everything and then you sit there and you look at

668
01:03:24.72 --> 01:03:29.36
your revenue and your revenues declining your traditions high your products not on time and you're

669
01:03:29.36 --> 01:03:35.92
going to go on gee I wonder what's going on and it it it it takes Mike and I about all of two seconds

670
01:03:35.92 --> 01:03:41.44
to to see that and it's unfortunate and one of the things that we really wanted to get across is

671
01:03:42.24 --> 01:03:47.52
you can really leverage HR in a strategic function and it makes all the difference to every single

672
01:03:47.52 --> 01:03:52.96
part of your business and the more of a talent mindset you have and the more that you empower

673
01:03:52.96 --> 01:03:58.24
human resources to be your strategic talent partner that revenue will come that product will be

674
01:03:58.24 --> 01:04:05.04
on time that service will be good it's it's not rocket science but in some places it's a brand

675
01:04:05.04 --> 01:04:11.52
in concept let's go back to that cost so there's there's an old attitude you can't outspend

676
01:04:11.52 --> 01:04:18.56
a good hiring process yeah because the consequences of having a poor hiring process can sink

677
01:04:19.12 --> 01:04:24.16
a company one of the statistics we found is that for senior level executive positions

678
01:04:24.72 --> 01:04:33.12
the cost of a bad senior leader can be 213% of that individual's annual salary so giving

679
01:04:33.12 --> 01:04:40.48
example if there you have a 300 thousand dollar salary CEO or executive that could cost the company is

680
01:04:40.48 --> 01:04:47.76
highest 639 thousand that's let's say that's a direct cost so what a lot of companies can't

681
01:04:47.76 --> 01:04:54.64
track from a tuition is really the the indirect cost and that's about two thirds of the cost of

682
01:04:54.64 --> 01:05:01.60
a tuition you can't put a number on the damage to a culture that a senior leader can cost

683
01:05:01.60 --> 01:05:06.48
maybe for two years that impacts sales and that's what's very hard for a lot of companies because

684
01:05:06.48 --> 01:05:11.84
they can't see it on their bottom line directly good CEOs can come hang out to national

685
01:05:11.84 --> 01:05:16.16
on front and go work with some clients and you you'll get to see that all the time

686
01:05:16.96 --> 01:05:22.64
toxic leader a bad leader a leader with a negative attitude everyone below them either doesn't

687
01:05:22.64 --> 01:05:27.52
perform well or leaves if they're good and you know it is the good people as we said earlier the

688
01:05:27.52 --> 01:05:31.20
good people leave the bad people stay there and don't perform well that's what happens

689
01:05:31.20 --> 01:05:36.48
on their bad leader it's total nightmare what would see a little I think Henry Ford is

690
01:05:36.48 --> 01:05:40.40
credited with this quote they're at a board meeting and they were talking about leadership

691
01:05:40.40 --> 01:05:45.28
development and somebody said hey well what if we develop our people in they leave and Henry

692
01:05:45.28 --> 01:05:50.88
Ford looked at all them said what if we don't and they stay this is why leadership development

693
01:05:50.88 --> 01:05:56.000
matters so as you're reading that that section right there you saw George and I getting like

694
01:05:56.000 --> 01:06:02.72
agitated we get we I mean this is how passionate we are this subject so through echelon front

695
01:06:02.72 --> 01:06:09.60
I spoke with a HR group there was like 500 HR leaders from an area we did it it was supposed to

696
01:06:09.60 --> 01:06:16.72
be in person conference code and so it was on mine but I had like 100 HR leaders reach out they

697
01:06:16.72 --> 01:06:21.84
were just fired up because I talked about the book like you guys are the key to the success

698
01:06:21.84 --> 01:06:28.24
of every organization don't let your leaders tell you otherwise so you know Tracey Kio and

699
01:06:28.24 --> 01:06:36.56
Paddy McCor you know Paddy McCor was the CHRO for Netflix built a strong organization both

700
01:06:36.56 --> 01:06:46.16
these wait what's Netflix yeah both these ladies should be CEOs of any Fortune 500 company

701
01:06:46.16 --> 01:06:52.24
they just have a passion for talent acquisition in talent management or leadership development and

702
01:06:52.24 --> 01:06:58.24
I mean you look at Tracey Kio Harvard educated cutter teeth and sales and marketing and was

703
01:06:58.24 --> 01:07:04.40
asked at one point during the career hey we've got a problem with you know HR can you go fix it

704
01:07:04.40 --> 01:07:10.72
of course answer was no they said good you got it and she developed a passion your HR leader

705
01:07:10.72 --> 01:07:18.80
has to be a business leader they have to and HR even though I love HR sometimes has become a

706
01:07:18.80 --> 01:07:26.72
dumping ground for average or mediocre performers and most often those HR leaders are just

707
01:07:26.72 --> 01:07:36.64
compliance leaders they're not a strategic function so if your HR reports into legal it's a compliance

708
01:07:36.64 --> 01:07:44.96
function if they report into finance it's an overhead function but as Tracey Kio will tell you

709
01:07:44.96 --> 01:07:50.64
if they report into the CEO and have a direct line and they're involved in the talent strategy

710
01:07:50.64 --> 01:07:54.64
then there's a chance in hell there's strategic function that is going to help build the organization

711
01:07:54.64 --> 01:08:01.36
into a world class organization and so that's where that misalignment between senior leaders in HR

712
01:08:01.36 --> 01:08:07.44
is killing a lot of organizations because back to the talent mindset yeah that's a big that's a big

713
01:08:07.44 --> 01:08:11.84
change actually it's not even that big of a change it's a little change that will have a huge impact

714
01:08:11.84 --> 01:08:17.36
you start getting people to really start to grow the or grow an organization properly with the

715
01:08:17.36 --> 01:08:23.44
right people that's exactly what you're talking about you go into this section here I'm skipping

716
01:08:23.44 --> 01:08:29.52
ahead this section here that I liked it's it's entitled fear based hiring special operations

717
01:08:29.52 --> 01:08:34.56
community has become world class model for potential based hiring which is their foundation of

718
01:08:34.56 --> 01:08:39.28
their assessment and selection process in contrast many companies instead of hiring the candidates

719
01:08:39.28 --> 01:08:45.20
with the most potential higher those candidates that inspire the least amount of fear

720
01:08:46.48 --> 01:08:53.68
this kind of fear based hiring usually comes down to one of three fallacies number one red flags

721
01:08:53.68 --> 01:09:00.96
are more important than green flags number two leaders shouldn't be outshined by their followers

722
01:09:00.96 --> 01:09:08.56
and number three somebody's better than nobody you go on in traditional corporate hiring practices

723
01:09:08.56 --> 01:09:16.64
the objective has seemingly shift from higher the best to higher the familiar and safe people are

724
01:09:16.64 --> 01:09:25.52
more afraid of a bad higher than they are excited by a good higher you go on here fear based hiring

725
01:09:25.52 --> 01:09:29.20
is dogmatic about objective requirements you guys already talked about this black and white

726
01:09:29.20 --> 01:09:34.88
criteria make it easy to say yes or no does this person have ex years of industry experience does

727
01:09:34.88 --> 01:09:40.08
this person have wide degree these criteria don't matter nearly as much as you might think

728
01:09:40.08 --> 01:09:46.56
the ten-conylbrient decor former commander of army special forces assessment selection told us

729
01:09:46.56 --> 01:09:52.64
when I arrived in my command anything easily measured was heavily weighted in the selection process

730
01:09:52.64 --> 01:09:56.88
the problem was it didn't have a lot of predictive value the same is true in business

731
01:09:57.92 --> 01:10:01.52
just because you can measure something doesn't mean it's important and just because you can't

732
01:10:01.52 --> 01:10:07.20
measure something doesn't mean it's not important the only question that truly matters is does

733
01:10:07.20 --> 01:10:13.28
this person have the potential to be a top performer don't disregard red flags entirely but don't

734
01:10:13.28 --> 01:10:18.88
obsess over them either in combat you don't want to get shot but at the same time if you're

735
01:10:18.88 --> 01:10:24.08
primary concern is not getting shot then you don't go into battle if you make your hiring

736
01:10:24.08 --> 01:10:29.84
decision based on avoiding your worst case scenario you'll never achieve your best case scenario

737
01:10:29.84 --> 01:10:35.20
it's far more effective to look for green flags than for red flags oh people are scared

738
01:10:35.20 --> 01:10:41.20
you know and and and and and I don't want to get too far down into the minutia but if you're

739
01:10:41.20 --> 01:10:46.24
a manager and you've got an empty seat so many people that I've seen over 20 years are like

740
01:10:46.24 --> 01:10:50.72
I'm going to lose that seat if I don't get it filled with somebody I'm going to get somebody in there

741
01:10:50.72 --> 01:10:56.08
so anybody is better than somebody then they go down the objective requirements like well they

742
01:10:56.08 --> 01:11:00.56
don't have this they don't have this and so they're checking off red flags of objective requirements

743
01:11:00.56 --> 01:11:04.72
to put somebody roll and never asking the question is this the person with the character

744
01:11:04.72 --> 01:11:09.92
attributes that can do the job they're not looking they're they're literally scared well

745
01:11:09.92 --> 01:11:16.08
if I hire this person and oh they don't have five years how am I going to be looked at what

746
01:11:16.08 --> 01:11:22.40
if they don't do as well as I think and they don't they don't think that their leadership can

747
01:11:22.40 --> 01:11:27.76
take somebody with the right characteristics two or three years less experience than they

748
01:11:27.76 --> 01:11:32.64
mark and put them in the role and and and coach him to succeed they're they're scared to death

749
01:11:32.64 --> 01:11:38.000
they want it it just turns into this machine how fast how fast can you hire how fast can you get

750
01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:43.68
that butt in the seat I'll take that step further at the risk of being a little bit of a

751
01:11:44.64 --> 01:11:52.72
stereo typing people but who's hungrier the person that you know has two years experience going

752
01:11:52.72 --> 01:11:57.12
into a role that needs five years experience or wait will you know or the person that has seven

753
01:11:57.12 --> 01:12:01.52
years experience going into a role with five years experience required who's who's hungrier

754
01:12:01.52 --> 01:12:05.52
who's trying to prove themselves a little bit more I don't know man I'm going to be in

755
01:12:05.52 --> 01:12:11.04
Georgia to hear hungry individual that wants to prove themselves and and and I've seen this time

756
01:12:11.04 --> 01:12:16.56
and again is you know the recruiters that I've brought up to town acquisition specialist I call

757
01:12:16.56 --> 01:12:19.12
them talent consultants because they're really embedded in the business they'll go

758
01:12:19.68 --> 01:12:23.36
have talked with this guy yeah they're two or three years lied on the experience you were asking

759
01:12:23.36 --> 01:12:28.08
for I promise you this hungry they're hungry they want it they want to get after it

760
01:12:28.08 --> 01:12:32.96
and the manager says well they don't have the seven years of experience and it goes back to

761
01:12:32.96 --> 01:12:38.16
what Brian Decker said you know they picked seven years almost out of the year that seven years

762
01:12:38.16 --> 01:12:44.16
is not predictive of success working for a competitor is not predictive of success

763
01:12:45.52 --> 01:12:52.32
character attributes are predictive and you need to be watching for those check

764
01:12:52.32 --> 01:12:59.84
another fear but fear-based hiring problem leaders shouldn't be outshined by the followers

765
01:12:59.84 --> 01:13:04.64
average or underperforming managers often fear hiring someone who outshined them because they

766
01:13:04.64 --> 01:13:09.12
don't want to hire themselves out of a job there should never be a maximum standard for talent

767
01:13:09.12 --> 01:13:13.84
only a minimum if you're not hiring people better than your current employees you'll never

768
01:13:13.84 --> 01:13:19.20
raise the bar for talent within your organization that's just the classic surround yourself with

769
01:13:19.20 --> 01:13:24.48
people better better than you I want to work myself out of a job I want to have and we go in

770
01:13:24.48 --> 01:13:28.56
a little bit later about succession planning I need to have as many people who can take my

771
01:13:28.56 --> 01:13:33.04
place and corporate mercados and do that you know the succession planning we do in the military

772
01:13:33.04 --> 01:13:38.24
to muscle memory but I always want people who are going to push me to be a better leader they're

773
01:13:38.24 --> 01:13:42.64
going to push me to get better at my game to up the game I mean when you roll with people do you

774
01:13:42.64 --> 01:13:46.40
roll with people that are easy to beat sometimes

775
01:13:46.40 --> 01:13:53.60
something I can't I might want this this toxic environment right now it's here for an hour

776
01:13:53.60 --> 01:13:59.36
it's waiting for a moment that's the first moment for echo Charles to shine yeah sometimes I do

777
01:13:59.36 --> 01:14:08.56
roll with people that are easier a lot easier you do somebody's better than nobody and you you

778
01:14:08.56 --> 01:14:12.16
know you talked about that just feeling like we better get someone in the platoon and you know

779
01:14:12.16 --> 01:14:19.28
this happened in in Charlie Ptun life had a guy a good guy but he just wasn't really didn't

780
01:14:19.28 --> 01:14:25.20
really have the just couldn't get the job done and you know coach and we wrote about it in

781
01:14:25.20 --> 01:14:30.16
dichotomy and leadership but one of the things that I told Laef I said hey Laef if you get rid

782
01:14:30.16 --> 01:14:34.24
of this guy you're not getting another one I mean there's there's you know you're going to go

783
01:14:34.24 --> 01:14:39.36
on deployment you're just with missing a guy and because we're going to we're going to get rid of

784
01:14:39.36 --> 01:14:46.000
and you know Laef was like well and he thought about it he said you know what I think we're

785
01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:50.64
better off without him and you know that to me that was a little litness test for me because you know

786
01:14:50.64 --> 01:14:53.60
Laef might be thinking hey I'll just replace him with some other guy and we'll you know we'll

787
01:14:53.60 --> 01:14:58.80
step it up it was a litness test for me to see what Laef really was thinking and if you really

788
01:14:58.80 --> 01:15:06.000
would rather not take someone that means you don't feel comfortable with him at all so there's a quote

789
01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:12.32
from Charlie Beckwith for the listeners Charlie Beckwith is the founder of Delta Force you know

790
01:15:12.32 --> 01:15:18.56
surf time with the SAS which generated the idea for for a specialized force yet a quote that was

791
01:15:18.56 --> 01:15:29.12
I'd rather go down the river with seven studs than 100 shitheads and it goes to point that

792
01:15:29.12 --> 01:15:33.84
yeah I'd rather select highly talented people into the organization and have less people

793
01:15:33.84 --> 01:15:41.04
than you know falling quantity is not better than quality never has been and you know the the quote

794
01:15:41.04 --> 01:15:50.48
from her kill her your clippers the Greek philosopher 500 BC about the 100 soldiers on the

795
01:15:50.48 --> 01:15:59.36
on the battlefield 80 or sorry 80 or just targets tend to even deserve to be there and then there's

796
01:15:59.36 --> 01:16:04.96
10 that are warriors but that one that one will always bring us home I mean these guys all talked about

797
01:16:04.96 --> 01:16:10.000
the the importance of talent and you'd rather bring talent people in individually

798
01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:15.76
then build a massive quick army that's when you deviate from the process it works out poorly for you

799
01:16:15.76 --> 01:16:20.48
yeah when you bring the wrong person in you're actually just creating more drain on your time

800
01:16:20.48 --> 01:16:25.68
just mayhem yeah mayhem and then it's a cancer and then your A players are looking at you going

801
01:16:25.68 --> 01:16:32.40
why do you bring a sea player in and now it reflects on you as the leader that your bar

802
01:16:32.40 --> 01:16:36.80
wasn't high enough the your standards weren't high enough that you were tolerating this sea player

803
01:16:36.80 --> 01:16:42.000
this be player and we all don't have that works out and never ever well

804
01:16:46.08 --> 01:16:54.72
next section what makes special operations so special and in here you you kind of profile

805
01:16:54.72 --> 01:17:04.40
one individual an individual by the name of Johnny Kim which podcast 2021 you can listen

806
01:17:04.40 --> 01:17:11.76
Johnny Kim's story it's it's just unbelievable what what made you want to profile Johnny in here

807
01:17:12.56 --> 01:17:20.08
so Johnny and I and Ryan were all in the same but class and what stuck out about Johnny now

808
01:17:20.08 --> 01:17:25.44
it goes back to why I was judging Ryan you got to understand my career prior to that I'd finished

809
01:17:25.44 --> 01:17:29.12
number one in pretty much every military school from boot camp in school of infantry

810
01:17:29.92 --> 01:17:34.08
finished third and recon school out of thirty behind two guys that went on to be Marzokde at one

811
01:17:34.88 --> 01:17:40.48
even you know graduate number one from Reno CS so when you're on a successful track what

812
01:17:40.48 --> 01:17:43.60
what happens you become a little bit arrogant you think you have things figured out and I thought

813
01:17:43.60 --> 01:17:49.36
I had things figured out naturally because I was still a sergeant in the Marine Corps the class

814
01:17:49.36 --> 01:17:53.12
sort of gravitated towards me because I had a rough neck style of leadership and they loved it and

815
01:17:53.12 --> 01:17:59.60
the instructors loved it as well but Johnny I just sort of always dismissed Johnny because small

816
01:18:00.64 --> 01:18:07.20
Asian kid Korean from LA just you know he's sort of I don't want to say devoid of emotion

817
01:18:07.20 --> 01:18:12.24
he's not he's not a showy guy and naturally because he didn't have a flame buoyant personality

818
01:18:12.24 --> 01:18:16.16
I figured out the sketches not performed it he's just another one of the the students that

819
01:18:16.16 --> 01:18:19.12
he was going to drop or go make it through and be a non-factor in the sealed teams

820
01:18:21.36 --> 01:18:26.72
in this book I think you're seeing that I show my ass a lot in these assumptions that I made about

821
01:18:26.72 --> 01:18:31.28
you know who's going to be a good seal and who wasn't and you know usually that was wrong

822
01:18:31.28 --> 01:18:36.16
but those are the scars as you get involved in town acquisition it is like you don't

823
01:18:36.16 --> 01:18:41.20
become better at this process of assessing and selecting the right people in your organization

824
01:18:41.20 --> 01:18:45.20
unless you screw up yeah I'd say your assessment was wrong

825
01:18:45.20 --> 01:18:53.76
on multiple levels because not only is Johnny Kim an awesome seal and ranks you know above

826
01:18:53.76 --> 01:19:00.56
among the highest of you know respect in the seal teams but then just as a human I mean then

827
01:19:00.56 --> 01:19:06.40
as a Harvard doctor and then as an astronaut and then just basically as an overall human being

828
01:19:06.40 --> 01:19:14.40
he's right up there with very rare fire there so I talked to Johnny what I you know I wanted to

829
01:19:14.40 --> 01:19:18.80
get approved through NASA that he was good he read you know I think the instructors looked

830
01:19:18.80 --> 01:19:24.08
Johnny and they just sort of you made a snap of judge judgment you know he's just quite

831
01:19:24.08 --> 01:19:29.52
little guy and watching him because again we both reported in the sealed team three my job

832
01:19:29.52 --> 01:19:34.96
just continued to drop because he was better than I was was day one out of Buds I mean he was just

833
01:19:34.96 --> 01:19:39.68
that smart where he picked up everything quickly you know 18 delta now he's a high speed medic

834
01:19:39.68 --> 01:19:46.24
quickly rushed to sniper school becomes a sniper you know you either be treating

835
01:19:46.24 --> 01:19:49.92
casualties on the battlefield or he'd be pulling the trigger eliminating Islamic

836
01:19:49.92 --> 01:19:58.000
extremists and the guy was amazing and humbled to to to have served with him and

837
01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:01.84
based off his podcast we had a very close conversation about one night in the soccer city

838
01:20:02.64 --> 01:20:08.48
which you know was a bad night for everyone but ultimately that was on stone or an eye

839
01:20:08.48 --> 01:20:13.84
that we even let the guys go out when we knew we weren't ready but yeah it's the the point with

840
01:20:13.84 --> 01:20:17.12
Johnny's a lot of people just would have looked past him quickly because you know he didn't have

841
01:20:17.12 --> 01:20:26.24
college degree from LA nothing stood out on paper because you you want you know peel that on you back

842
01:20:27.28 --> 01:20:33.60
yeah I think I think a good word to describe Johnny that you would pick up is just unassuming right

843
01:20:33.60 --> 01:20:40.88
he's just I think he just she's just unassuming and he that's what he is I mean it's it's

844
01:20:40.88 --> 01:20:46.80
less now because you kind of people know his background now so I'm sure that just comes across

845
01:20:46.80 --> 01:20:55.52
but it's super just a super humble on the unassuming guy and yeah uh a beast now I tell people

846
01:20:55.52 --> 01:21:00.72
I worked with Johnny Kim you know I start with Johnny Kim that's awesome

847
01:21:00.72 --> 01:21:10.72
the origins of the soft talent minds at the very core of soft is a talent mindset the idea

848
01:21:10.72 --> 01:21:14.32
that small group of talented individuals can be effective fighting force capable of defeating

849
01:21:14.32 --> 01:21:20.56
larger enemy forces in delivering strict strategic impacts through skull small scale operations

850
01:21:20.56 --> 01:21:27.60
three innate traits of lead spot special operations talent mindset and subsequent success one

851
01:21:27.60 --> 01:21:35.04
no one has prior special operations experience so raw talent must be the selection criteria

852
01:21:35.76 --> 01:21:40.16
the most effective selection is based on mindset and character that's a crazy thing to think about

853
01:21:41.12 --> 01:21:46.80
that when you go into special operations they're most of the time there's zero experience

854
01:21:46.80 --> 01:21:52.08
in special operations you know that's just that's like a crazy thing to think about

855
01:21:52.08 --> 01:21:58.40
where does that seal come from he comes from a high school you know this is the story you know

856
01:21:58.40 --> 01:22:01.92
we're working with business leaders and they think they need to experience it so important I

857
01:22:01.92 --> 01:22:06.32
say hey I don't go to a high school and say hey we're recruiting for Navy SEALS raise a hand if you

858
01:22:06.32 --> 01:22:11.68
have special operations experience don't it guys you did you know it was your bowl hate French foreign

859
01:22:11.68 --> 01:22:17.60
Legion the UK special forces go get some experience come back and uh and then let us know

860
01:22:17.60 --> 01:22:24.16
uh next one special operations for since our teams teams win not individuals number three special

861
01:22:24.16 --> 01:22:28.72
operations teams work in high stakes environments when the stakes are high mediocrity is unacceptable

862
01:22:29.28 --> 01:22:35.36
let's look more closely at these traits raw talent this is this is no emphasis on experience

863
01:22:35.36 --> 01:22:39.76
raw talent is difficult to identify industry experience on the other hand is far easier to identify

864
01:22:39.76 --> 01:22:44.80
and measure this is why business world often falls in the bad habit of overaligning on industry

865
01:22:44.80 --> 01:22:50.32
experience and as a hiring criterion special operations does not have that luxury because nobody has

866
01:22:50.32 --> 01:22:55.44
prior special operations experience if the soft community began selecting for industry experience

867
01:22:55.44 --> 01:22:59.68
the US would not have a special operations community out of necessity special operations had

868
01:22:59.68 --> 01:23:06.000
to develop a core competency in potential based hiring where raw talent is the primary consideration

869
01:23:07.84 --> 01:23:12.96
that's self-explanatory next one team mentality special operations forces are structured as teams they

870
01:23:12.96 --> 01:23:17.52
are incentivized as teams and they win or lose as teams not as individuals in contrast in the

871
01:23:17.52 --> 01:23:23.12
biz world in the business world the egos can often rule and the team can be less and emphasized

872
01:23:23.84 --> 01:23:28.48
people are rewarded for individual achievements so individuals are often concerned only about

873
01:23:28.48 --> 01:23:33.44
their incentives versus the overall health of the organization bad leaders who hire and manage

874
01:23:33.44 --> 01:23:39.92
others often accept and often and even encourage mediocre employees because it raises their own value

875
01:23:39.92 --> 01:23:49.60
in comparison a team mentality greatly reduces the power of ego yeah there's nothing worse than

876
01:23:49.60 --> 01:23:54.80
encouraging mediocre people to be in your organization so that you can look good

877
01:23:58.48 --> 01:24:00.40
does you have something on that Mike?

878
01:24:00.40 --> 01:24:07.76
I do let me hit back on the lack of industry experience to real vignette so again we quoted

879
01:24:07.76 --> 01:24:12.80
Charlie Beckwith if you didn't know it because we also interviewed what we didn't interview

880
01:24:12.80 --> 01:24:17.44
Charlie Beckwith because he's passed but we did interview throughout this book a guy named

881
01:24:17.44 --> 01:24:24.64
General Jerry Boykin amazing individual was a long time dealt a forced memory even the commander

882
01:24:25.20 --> 01:24:30.72
was involved in desert one operation the equal claw so you know we went into the history

883
01:24:30.72 --> 01:24:35.44
Charlie Beckwith was a strong believer that before you could even get into special operations

884
01:24:35.44 --> 01:24:40.96
and this was the old sort of mentality that that that existed within the military that you have to

885
01:24:40.96 --> 01:24:45.92
serve as a conventional soldier either an officer and listed before you could try out for special

886
01:24:45.92 --> 01:24:52.32
operations and he was very dogmatic about that and General Boykin talked about when the

887
01:24:52.32 --> 01:24:57.52
Army Special Forces community created the 18 X-ray program because of the needs of the war where they

888
01:24:57.52 --> 01:25:04.24
took people directly off the street that had the right attributes past the initial tests intelligence

889
01:25:04.24 --> 01:25:12.48
physical standards mental standards that they actually made as good of special forces soldiers

890
01:25:12.48 --> 01:25:17.68
if not better because they didn't have bad habits from the conventional forces that was one of you

891
01:25:17.68 --> 01:25:23.76
so let's put that into a private sector you know context the other vignette google did a

892
01:25:23.76 --> 01:25:31.44
study on what made their most successful managers so successful they they they they came up with

893
01:25:31.44 --> 01:25:37.20
ten criterion that made them so highly successful industry experience came in a number number nine

894
01:25:37.20 --> 01:25:42.000
it was one of the the least important things now if you look at extreme ownership pretty much all

895
01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:47.68
these principles of how we lead were much farther ahead than the importance of extreme I'm sorry

896
01:25:47.68 --> 01:25:53.76
the industry experience so that's why this potential based hiring is so much more powerful than

897
01:25:53.76 --> 01:26:02.72
objective trivial requirements like industry experience when when they started the 18 X when did they do that

898
01:26:03.44 --> 01:26:10.64
I want to say that was roughly around 2003 2004 that that program came to revolution

899
01:26:10.64 --> 01:26:16.32
I'd have to go back and find the exact year yeah John strike reminder was talking about that

900
01:26:16.32 --> 01:26:21.28
and how there was like people in the special forces community that were saying all this is

901
01:26:21.28 --> 01:26:26.000
garbage you're gonna get these guys that don't know what they're doing but like so many of those

902
01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:33.76
sag operators went right from boot camp to you know to a it and then on the special force

903
01:26:33.76 --> 01:26:38.72
and then they went right over to Vietnam and freaking just got after he he like was laughing about it

904
01:26:38.72 --> 01:26:44.88
because those guys were just freaking legit what with general boikom was telling the story you know

905
01:26:44.88 --> 01:26:49.52
you had senior leaders when he was the commander of use to sock which is he's the commander of

906
01:26:49.52 --> 01:26:54.56
all army special operations and they were arguing there's two camps of no we can't accept people

907
01:26:54.56 --> 01:26:59.44
without conventional infantry experience and the other camp was hey know we can take people off

908
01:26:59.44 --> 01:27:04.000
the street and turn them into great special forces soldiers and of course what there is a command

909
01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:09.12
soldier major use to sock sitting back the senior and listed visor wall both camps fought

910
01:27:09.12 --> 01:27:16.48
and finally he said when he piped in he said hey I was an OJT soldier in Vietnam I didn't go to

911
01:27:16.48 --> 01:27:21.36
the special forces qualification course they sent me right over to uh to to Vietnam and I learned

912
01:27:21.36 --> 01:27:26.32
the job well outside in the wire and they all shut up and you said okay there you go

913
01:27:26.32 --> 01:27:33.36
right uh last thing high stakes perhaps more than any other factor the high stakes under which

914
01:27:33.36 --> 01:27:40.72
the soft operators under which soft operates necessitate a talent mindset war and combat are among

915
01:27:40.72 --> 01:27:44.40
the most unforgiving environments in the world on the stake on the battlefield can mean the

916
01:27:44.40 --> 01:27:49.28
difference between life and death not only for oneself but for ones fellow soldiers a failed

917
01:27:49.28 --> 01:27:53.92
mission can mean the destruction of cities and the loss of civilian life excellence and execution

918
01:27:53.92 --> 01:27:58.64
is the standard because it has to be the stakes are that high it should be no difference in bit

919
01:27:58.64 --> 01:28:03.52
different in business in business the risk may not be life or death but the stakes are incredibly

920
01:28:03.52 --> 01:28:09.04
high don't fool yourself businesses war war by nonviolent means the result of a bad hire or

921
01:28:09.04 --> 01:28:16.24
several bad hires is the underperformance of the business if not a nose dive to bankruptcy it is

922
01:28:16.24 --> 01:28:21.52
not literal death but it is death in the marketplace that death spells disaster for you and your

923
01:28:21.52 --> 01:28:30.32
employees whose well-being depends on the health of your organization look at today covid hit us

924
01:28:31.44 --> 01:28:37.12
for those people that have these attributes as leaders they'll factor there's like okay hey that's

925
01:28:37.12 --> 01:28:41.68
part of the environment we got to operate in let's go do it all right hey let's you know let's

926
01:28:41.68 --> 01:28:45.36
prioritize what we got to pay attention to how do we pay attention to our people how do we pay

927
01:28:45.36 --> 01:28:48.96
attention to our product how do we continue to drive the revenue and take care of our people

928
01:28:49.76 --> 01:28:54.24
and it and it was it just didn't phase those people and I've been around quite a few of them

929
01:28:54.24 --> 01:29:00.64
were it was like okay yeah we got covid okay and what's your point but you can start to see

930
01:29:00.64 --> 01:29:05.44
those companies where that talent wasn't there where that talent mindset where that leadership

931
01:29:05.44 --> 01:29:11.52
wasn't there covid hits they lose their minds what did they do let's start cutting people let's

932
01:29:11.52 --> 01:29:18.32
cut this let's cut this immediately we'll we're going through today speaks exactly to

933
01:29:19.04 --> 01:29:23.84
why it's so critical to have a talent mindset and get people with those character attributes

934
01:29:24.40 --> 01:29:28.56
in the roles that make a difference and and and I love but you guys have pointed out earlier

935
01:29:28.56 --> 01:29:32.48
the US military is in the most powerful force in the world it's the US economy and that was one of

936
01:29:32.48 --> 01:29:38.16
the things we wanted to do with this book was to we want to continue to contribute to strengthen that

937
01:29:41.44 --> 01:29:48.08
you go into a skip and ahead a little bit you go into a scenario and it just it just spells out

938
01:29:48.08 --> 01:29:52.88
exactly what you're talking about you got a guy Daniel you go into this Daniel's looking to

939
01:29:52.88 --> 01:29:58.56
hire candidates for sales leadership position and he used two search firms EF Overwatch which is

940
01:29:58.56 --> 01:30:05.36
what which is excellent front and a competitor and Jeremy so this is here's the two people

941
01:30:05.36 --> 01:30:11.52
that got presented Jeremy presented by a competitive search firm 3.9 GPA from a prestigious

942
01:30:11.52 --> 01:30:15.92
university high intelligence four years of industry experience with two different companies

943
01:30:15.92 --> 01:30:25.44
driven highly competent borderline arrogant Chris presented by EF Overwatch 3.2 GPA from a

944
01:30:25.44 --> 01:30:30.96
public university above average intelligence faced significant adversity in life came from a

945
01:30:30.96 --> 01:30:35.52
lower middle class family and held a full-time job on college recently separated army infantry

946
01:30:35.52 --> 01:30:40.40
officer who held several different functional billets in the army has all the attributes

947
01:30:40.40 --> 01:30:46.24
are required to be a highly successful sales leader but lacks industry experience which of these

948
01:30:46.24 --> 01:30:51.28
candidates would you choose since this chapter is about hiring for character in scale you might know

949
01:30:51.28 --> 01:30:56.48
the answer is most likely Chris not Jeremy but be honest at your company which one of these

950
01:30:56.48 --> 01:31:01.76
candidates would most likely be hired that's a good question when you put be honest in front of it

951
01:31:02.48 --> 01:31:05.84
because right because it's a fear-based hire is to go you know what we don't know about this

952
01:31:05.84 --> 01:31:11.12
Chris guy he seems like a good guy using the army but man Jeremy he's got four years of experience

953
01:31:12.56 --> 01:31:16.72
you go on most companies would choose Jeremy without hesitation Chris's GPA was average

954
01:31:16.72 --> 01:31:22.56
compares to Jeremy's but he didn't have the industry specific experience but he was one of those

955
01:31:22.56 --> 01:31:26.16
people who perform time and time again whatever you put in front of him you'd find a way through it

956
01:31:26.16 --> 01:31:34.24
over it or around it he was relentless and adaptable so you go on they they have eventually chose

957
01:31:34.24 --> 01:31:40.000
Jeremy over Chris and two weeks later the guy calls up and says we made a huge mistake

958
01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:50.08
that's how it turns out that click that click time and time again it and here's the funny thing is

959
01:31:51.28 --> 01:31:58.88
you remember tray holder who helped us out during the infancy of if ever watched we had this call

960
01:31:58.88 --> 01:32:06.64
and it was either we can have to two weeks after they made that selection and this leader within

961
01:32:06.64 --> 01:32:12.40
the company who we had a personal relationship said hey this guy is an arrogant you know what he's

962
01:32:12.40 --> 01:32:17.68
like we've got a problem and you know we're not going to say hey we told you so the guy he's trying

963
01:32:17.68 --> 01:32:23.60
to run a major distribution center he made a call we're there to support him and our basic

964
01:32:23.60 --> 01:32:28.48
question was well do you want to talk to our candidate he said no and said we asked what what are you

965
01:32:28.48 --> 01:32:34.16
going to do about it he said nothing and I just asked him was said if you have some of the

966
01:32:34.16 --> 01:32:39.44
that you feel is going to poison the culture why aren't you going to do anything and it was if I

967
01:32:39.44 --> 01:32:46.000
get let him go two weeks into the job my senior leaders are going to look at me like what are you

968
01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:50.88
doing down there and so that individual was going to let it ride I haven't talked to him I don't

969
01:32:50.88 --> 01:32:55.68
know if that individual stayed and sometimes things changed within four you know a few weeks maybe

970
01:32:55.68 --> 01:33:01.44
that that individual who was arrogant came around but uh well you think the chances of that are

971
01:33:01.44 --> 01:33:07.12
very well it's but how often it and let's you know we talked a lot about special operations

972
01:33:07.12 --> 01:33:12.72
and how great of an organization is how great they are selecting high potentials but how often

973
01:33:12.72 --> 01:33:19.68
if we're being honest with ourselves did we let mediocracy rain within the seal teams yeah I

974
01:33:19.68 --> 01:33:26.48
mean you need you need people and what what was horrible you know I didn't mind that look you

975
01:33:26.48 --> 01:33:29.76
you got to have people that are going to do some of the jobs that are a little bit easier in the

976
01:33:29.76 --> 01:33:33.44
teams I mean it's just the reality the situation and you know when I was going through officer candidate

977
01:33:33.44 --> 01:33:39.44
school I had whatever 80 people in my class in my officer candidate class I was the class president

978
01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:49.68
and you got to write like suggestions to the drill instructor and or whatever so I guess a group of

979
01:33:49.68 --> 01:33:53.92
people like four or five people because I had a bunch of prior and listed guys in my class all great

980
01:33:53.92 --> 01:34:00.40
guys and and female as well there's guys and girls in there and somebody wrote to the the drill instructor

981
01:34:00.40 --> 01:34:07.04
and said we need to get rid of these four people they don't belong they don't belong as officers

982
01:34:07.04 --> 01:34:15.76
in the Navy and so my drill instructor whose name was gunnery sergeant seals oddly enough great guy

983
01:34:15.76 --> 01:34:21.04
you know as you know I mean any Marine Corps drill instructors just freaking out standing so he

984
01:34:21.04 --> 01:34:28.32
gets up and he says hey I'll tell you what let's say we get rid of the bottom 10% of this class

985
01:34:30.56 --> 01:34:36.000
and he says now what happens tomorrow we got a new bottom 10% what happens after that we got a new

986
01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:41.44
bottom 10% so eventually realize you can guess what there's going to be a bell curve in any

987
01:34:41.44 --> 01:34:46.40
organization where I have a problem with this so so that's my explanation like hey the seal teams

988
01:34:46.40 --> 01:34:51.36
look you're gonna have some guys that are not the not long ball hitters you know you're gonna have

989
01:34:51.36 --> 01:34:56.32
some guys that are not long ball hitters the problem I have and and had and still have

990
01:34:57.20 --> 01:35:02.48
is when you take those guys and you put them in the leadership positions that's where it's a problem

991
01:35:02.48 --> 01:35:06.000
that's where it's a real problem in my book and we still love that to happen yeah it happened we

992
01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:09.92
still love that to happen because hey they've put in their time they've earned that spot you that's

993
01:35:09.92 --> 01:35:14.88
not a good criteria first off I'm gonna say you guys have a suggestion box in Navy officer

994
01:35:14.88 --> 01:35:19.44
candid school yeah it wasn't really a suggestion box I don't I don't that's why I couldn't really

995
01:35:19.44 --> 01:35:25.20
name what it was but it was some way of communicating with the drone structure I don't I forget what

996
01:35:25.20 --> 01:35:31.76
it was because I didn't do it but because I'm just gonna say it Marine Corps officer candid school

997
01:35:31.76 --> 01:35:36.64
that was called the trash can and the drone structures did not care you was a suggestion to you

998
01:35:36.64 --> 01:35:40.32
I don't know I don't know where I don't know where this idea came from I'm thinking to must have

999
01:35:40.32 --> 01:35:44.80
been some kind of suggestion box or maybe they raised their hands and asked him I don't know

1000
01:35:44.80 --> 01:35:50.24
but it was it was the reason I remember it it was somehow clandestine right they weren't they didn't

1001
01:35:50.24 --> 01:35:54.08
say in the middle of a class like because we used to basically get briefed all the time saying

1002
01:35:54.08 --> 01:35:57.12
in the hallways the barracks you know you'd all say it out front of your rooms you're all in big

1003
01:35:57.12 --> 01:36:06.000
lines so no one had the courage to say hey officer candid Smith Jones and and brown need to be

1004
01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:11.52
let go no one had the courage to that so they somehow through some mechanism and I get your humor

1005
01:36:11.52 --> 01:36:18.72
through some mechanism they they got to the to the drone structure and yeah I don't know what

1006
01:36:18.72 --> 01:36:29.04
that mechanism was but no the the navy officer candid school was pretty good to go I thought

1007
01:36:29.04 --> 01:36:32.88
how did good time we we so we actually one of the candidates to came to you if ever watch

1008
01:36:32.88 --> 01:36:36.72
fighter pilot actually was going through the training because we hold webinars every Friday

1009
01:36:36.72 --> 01:36:42.000
both in leadership and then career search and struck a quarter of this guy he actually moved

1010
01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:46.80
to Austin he's like hey just just so you know I went to officer candid school with with Chaka

1011
01:36:46.80 --> 01:36:54.80
with willing yeah he's like that guy saw later so you bring up a point that again we nerd out on this

1012
01:36:54.80 --> 01:37:01.60
yeah all talent follows a bell curve or normal distribution curve and you know that that is a

1013
01:37:01.60 --> 01:37:07.60
fundamental truth however the performance within that talent distribution is more like a I'm sorry

1014
01:37:07.60 --> 01:37:11.36
the the the performance is more along lines of a power distribution or some people call it the

1015
01:37:11.36 --> 01:37:17.04
paradeo principle it's just 80% of the results driven within your organization come from 20% of the

1016
01:37:17.04 --> 01:37:23.28
workforce that's that's it's just the realities as you say but ultimately what makes better

1017
01:37:23.28 --> 01:37:28.48
organizations and as we did the research is that competing companies within the industry all have

1018
01:37:28.48 --> 01:37:34.96
that bell curve it's you want the average performance of your entire workforce the statistical mean

1019
01:37:35.84 --> 01:37:40.64
to be higher than your competitors yeah and that's what makes special operations

1020
01:37:41.28 --> 01:37:47.84
so great is that not everyone's a a player they're not that's a small element the the long tail

1021
01:37:49.28 --> 01:37:54.48
but the overall performance of the entire force is much higher yeah you know slide that

1022
01:37:54.48 --> 01:38:01.44
thing to the right yeah that's the goal for sure so we're talking all about all this you know

1023
01:38:01.44 --> 01:38:06.56
experience and and how that's not the most important thing but then you guys go on to say this

1024
01:38:06.56 --> 01:38:10.56
which is also important we're not advocating that you disregard experience entirely you're not

1025
01:38:10.56 --> 01:38:14.80
going to hire kids straight out of high school for a C-suite position experience and past performance

1026
01:38:14.80 --> 01:38:19.92
matters for certain positions but you do need to be thoughtful about how you use experience

1027
01:38:19.92 --> 01:38:25.52
in the selection process we see companies make three common mistakes when it comes to looking

1028
01:38:25.52 --> 01:38:31.12
experience one they require experience that doesn't matter to job performance two they require

1029
01:38:31.12 --> 01:38:36.72
very specific experience when general experience would be just as good and three they prioritize

1030
01:38:36.72 --> 01:38:42.80
industry experience over character so you guys aren't saying to ignore experience you're saying

1031
01:38:42.80 --> 01:38:49.12
hey pay attention to it exactly it's and ultimately it's not what counts and you know one of the other

1032
01:38:49.12 --> 01:38:53.36
fallacies is you know if I have somebody with experience it was working at this competitor and I

1033
01:38:53.36 --> 01:38:59.12
bring them in well they were successful there they'll be successful here that that's just I boggles my

1034
01:38:59.12 --> 01:39:04.32
mind and I see it all the time but yeah these are the three the three mistakes and you know we talk

1035
01:39:04.32 --> 01:39:10.80
about this in the book about gates once you set your requirements for this role and they meet those

1036
01:39:10.80 --> 01:39:18.08
that gate then closes everything after that is this part of what determines success as far as the

1037
01:39:18.08 --> 01:39:23.44
nine attributes and most people and you'll and on the ground level you'll watch a person come in you've

1038
01:39:23.44 --> 01:39:28.08
got these objective requirements and you'll have five people in the hiring process all these five

1039
01:39:28.08 --> 01:39:32.64
different members of the team and they will all ask different versions of the same questions about

1040
01:39:32.64 --> 01:39:41.04
their experience nobody's digging in nobody's digging in it I you know it's patience is a

1041
01:39:41.04 --> 01:39:47.92
virtue in my function I assure you and but they're listing out experience and hiring majors will

1042
01:39:47.92 --> 01:39:53.04
dump all of this stuff in thinking if I get all of this this experience and one person my company will

1043
01:39:53.04 --> 01:39:58.24
do better they're looking at the wrong things it's the character it's those attributes that make the

1044
01:39:58.24 --> 01:40:04.24
difference when when a COVID comes up when when a when another company comes out with a product when

1045
01:40:04.80 --> 01:40:09.44
you know we're behind or or we're short team members it's those character attributes that drive

1046
01:40:09.44 --> 01:40:15.76
that team forward when things get tough when you're under stress that's when character reveals

1047
01:40:15.76 --> 01:40:23.52
itself and in the business world that's when it counts the most so we over rotate on experience

1048
01:40:24.24 --> 01:40:29.84
and you know you know Mike and I try to go to great lengths in this book look we understand

1049
01:40:29.84 --> 01:40:34.56
your business leader you've got 50,000 things going on if you're a CEO you've got a million

1050
01:40:34.56 --> 01:40:40.64
things going on in your head but this will help you be better this is the competitive advantage

1051
01:40:40.64 --> 01:40:46.000
that you need and is prioritizing talent and these things that make the difference and yet these

1052
01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:51.12
three common mistakes they happen time and time and time again they will happen 10 times a day in

1053
01:40:51.12 --> 01:40:55.84
one company and that's a small company you get to a big company some of the fortune 50 that I've

1054
01:40:55.84 --> 01:41:02.96
worked with you'll see this a thousand times in one day and it and it multiplies itself but you guys have

1055
01:41:02.96 --> 01:41:08.88
both seen and I've seen it in my time you get a good leader you get talent on your team that's infectious

1056
01:41:08.88 --> 01:41:14.08
the game comes up you get a good player you get a rock star you're all like okay I'm chasing that guy

1057
01:41:14.08 --> 01:41:19.12
I'm coming up I gotta elevate my game because this is not looking good for me you know person

1058
01:41:19.12 --> 01:41:24.96
I love person on my right they're out trying to me I gotta step it up so you know you've got to

1059
01:41:24.96 --> 01:41:29.20
get the experience that's minimum for the job hey you gotta be able to do these things in the job

1060
01:41:29.20 --> 01:41:36.32
it doesn't matter we're not saying disregard it don't make it so specific that is really now talent

1061
01:41:36.32 --> 01:41:42.24
and that happens a lot and industry experience is not as important as you think and I mean google

1062
01:41:42.24 --> 01:41:47.44
points it out I mean it you know statistically it's not important but it makes managers feel better

1063
01:41:47.44 --> 01:41:51.92
oh I took somebody from my competitor they were doing really well they know our industry they're

1064
01:41:51.92 --> 01:41:58.24
gonna do well here it's just a fallacy and and if we can get people focused on character if we get

1065
01:41:58.24 --> 01:42:05.04
people focused on leadership that will power your company when the hard times come hey you're

1066
01:42:05.04 --> 01:42:10.24
gonna rock it you're gonna survive you're gonna make the U.S. economy that much more powerful

1067
01:42:10.24 --> 01:42:15.92
if you get the right mindset and you focus and you drive and get after it Brian Decker

1068
01:42:15.92 --> 01:42:20.56
talked about this with special forces assessment selection so to get into any of these special

1069
01:42:20.56 --> 01:42:25.44
operations community intellectual horsepowers requirement you have to have a minimum score we take

1070
01:42:25.44 --> 01:42:31.68
as bad there's a score once person passes that intelligence requirement what George is talking

1071
01:42:31.68 --> 01:42:36.88
about is that gate is closed it no longer comes back into the planning factor the hiring factor

1072
01:42:36.88 --> 01:42:42.24
whatsoever and what they found is that level they put a lot of thought behind it and what they see

1073
01:42:42.24 --> 01:42:48.000
is that if somebody hits what requirement dead on and somebody exceeds that requirement is that

1074
01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:52.08
the person that exceeds that requirement it's not necessarily correlated to a higher level of

1075
01:42:52.08 --> 01:42:57.28
performance so that's why you have to be very careful upfront about the gates you select

1076
01:42:58.40 --> 01:43:03.28
you know Brian Decker also told a story about again you know industry experience versus none

1077
01:43:03.28 --> 01:43:09.68
so when he was running SFAS you know sometimes we we bring civilians on and get in sort of the

1078
01:43:09.68 --> 01:43:16.000
dog and pony they put two groups through some obstacles that special forces soldiers run through

1079
01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:23.04
in groups and again these exercises are you know the cadre are watching to see what behaviors

1080
01:43:23.04 --> 01:43:29.36
come out from that from the individuals so it's a group of MBAs who were off the charts intelligence

1081
01:43:29.36 --> 01:43:35.44
had industry experience were were currently getting their MBAs and then a group of undergrads

1082
01:43:35.44 --> 01:43:42.72
you're talking 18 19 20 year olds first group of 27 to 35 year olds and you know naturally Brian

1083
01:43:42.72 --> 01:43:47.52
Decker and his cadre you know they were shown a good time but had an assumption that the

1084
01:43:47.52 --> 01:43:52.000
MBAs were just going to outperform the undergrads like cans down how do you think that I know

1085
01:43:53.36 --> 01:43:59.36
the undergrads absolutely decimated every obstacle much quicker than the MBA group

1086
01:44:00.08 --> 01:44:05.44
and it goes to to show you that you know that even though they had prior experience more vast

1087
01:44:05.44 --> 01:44:11.44
experience those undergrads actually because they lacked ego so it's yes they lacked the group

1088
01:44:11.44 --> 01:44:15.68
dynamic it goes to so if you have a lot of talented individuals that are humble and

1089
01:44:15.68 --> 01:44:19.84
lackey you go when they come together it's an exponential effect one plus one isn't too

1090
01:44:19.84 --> 01:44:26.24
with a group that truly unifies behind a common good one plus one equals three that it's an

1091
01:44:26.24 --> 01:44:33.76
exponential effect in task unit bruiser there was a point where we were I don't know how far

1092
01:44:33.76 --> 01:44:39.60
we were from deploying but we knew we were deploying to Iraq and one of the senior officers at the

1093
01:44:39.60 --> 01:44:48.08
command he came to me and said hey you know you're going to Iraq do you want to switch out

1094
01:44:48.08 --> 01:44:53.28
one of your platoons with this other platoon commander with this with this other platoon

1095
01:44:53.28 --> 01:44:58.16
who the platoon commander has a lot more experience than your two you know your two oh I see

1096
01:44:58.16 --> 01:45:05.04
is which was Seth and Lave and it's kind of funny because remember how the ceilings were out

1097
01:45:05.04 --> 01:45:09.84
because they were doing construction so Seth and Lave were in the task unit bruiser office and they

1098
01:45:09.84 --> 01:45:18.000
here this individual basically asking me if I wanted to swap out either one of these two so

1099
01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:20.96
Seth and Lave had very little experience they both on one deployment but they had just been

1100
01:45:20.96 --> 01:45:25.36
in the teams for like two years and one of the platoon commanders in one of the other platoons

1101
01:45:25.36 --> 01:45:31.28
had a lot more experience like he was a prior-in-listed guy and so the senior officer was saying hey

1102
01:45:31.28 --> 01:45:35.36
you know you can take one you know you can take this guy and his platoon and he's got way more

1103
01:45:35.36 --> 01:45:41.76
experience and might be a lot better for you and I was like I was like no and at this point I already knew

1104
01:45:41.76 --> 01:45:48.08
Seth and Lave and I go um no I said these guys have exactly what I want them to have which is

1105
01:45:48.08 --> 01:45:52.48
they're tough they're humble and they listen and that's all that's all I need that's like my

1106
01:45:52.48 --> 01:46:02.64
most important characteristics and he was like are you sure and I was like 100% that was that.

1107
01:46:03.68 --> 01:46:09.20
Next section the nine foundational character attributes of talent under pressure

1108
01:46:09.20 --> 01:46:15.84
one's mental and physical limits hard skills rapidly degrade what remains is character

1109
01:46:15.84 --> 01:46:23.60
skills are by design meant for unpredictable situations and environments says retired

1110
01:46:23.60 --> 01:46:29.84
seal commander rich divinity if businesses are interested in forming organizations and teams that

1111
01:46:29.84 --> 01:46:35.68
effectively deal with unpredictability and complexity they have to go deeper than the guy who has

1112
01:46:35.68 --> 01:46:41.92
the best sales record or the Harvard grad who's at the top of the class they have to look at character

1113
01:46:41.92 --> 01:46:48.48
characters key because it is an indicator of a person's capacity general William Boynkin points

1114
01:46:48.48 --> 01:46:56.000
to capacity as more important than current ability quote what are you looking for hard skills

1115
01:46:56.000 --> 01:47:03.12
or capacity ideally look for both but if you have to choose and you have a fair way of doing so

1116
01:47:03.12 --> 01:47:07.84
assess their capacity what is their capacity to learn new skills what is their capacity to think

1117
01:47:07.84 --> 01:47:14.56
for themselves what is their capacity to problem solve is it interesting you're here general Boynkin

1118
01:47:14.56 --> 01:47:19.60
like one of the priorities that he puts in there is their capacity to think for themselves not to

1119
01:47:19.60 --> 01:47:26.32
follow rules but to think for themselves back to the book according to general Boynkin it is the

1120
01:47:26.32 --> 01:47:31.28
focus on capacity is made special operation so successful on the battlefield and beyond a person's

1121
01:47:31.28 --> 01:47:37.36
character is the aggregate of their deeply ingrained attributes as we define it the nine foundational

1122
01:47:37.36 --> 01:47:44.88
character attributes of high potential individuals are drive resiliency adaptability humility integrity

1123
01:47:44.88 --> 01:47:50.08
effective intelligence team ability curiosity and emotional strength these traits are predictors

1124
01:47:50.08 --> 01:47:56.40
of high performance these attributes cannot be taught so they should be the focus of your hiring

1125
01:47:58.48 --> 01:48:03.60
check and then you're going to a little spot a little section about how

1126
01:48:03.60 --> 01:48:09.76
different special operations group sort of way those things out a little bit differently but

1127
01:48:09.76 --> 01:48:17.04
they all are looking for the same basic the same basic things kickcare doctor care all green

1128
01:48:17.68 --> 01:48:23.52
air force kernel psychologist he was heavily involved in the Marsoch assessment selection

1129
01:48:24.32 --> 01:48:29.84
he set a grid he's like they're all basically looking for ice cream just different like slightly

1130
01:48:29.84 --> 01:48:36.96
different flavors but you know the special forces guys seals Marsoch you know the Afsoch

1131
01:48:36.96 --> 01:48:41.92
guys of PJs and CCTs they're all interchangeable we have throw them in their group the attributes

1132
01:48:41.92 --> 01:48:47.60
are are very close totally you go into resiliency here a little bit somebody with high resiliency

1133
01:48:47.60 --> 01:48:52.64
bounces back from stress quickly is adaptable and is not easily discouraged and individual with

1134
01:48:52.64 --> 01:48:58.64
high resiliency resist quitting and is focused on completing goals essentially resiliency is how

1135
01:48:58.64 --> 01:49:03.92
people handle setbacks and persevere in the face of challenges they accept failures part of the process

1136
01:49:03.92 --> 01:49:10.72
they don't accept it passively but utilize their lessons learned and mistakes as a basis to grow

1137
01:49:10.72 --> 01:49:18.72
and then you go into a well it's a section about a person that could be considered possibly one of

1138
01:49:18.72 --> 01:49:23.44
the most resilient human beings in the world which is Mike Day who is just on this podcast number

1139
01:49:23.44 --> 01:49:33.12
241 and you know shot 27 times and then killed the enemy that had shot him and just unbelievable

1140
01:49:33.12 --> 01:49:40.96
story you put that in there you you've gone so yeah adaptability you talk about adaptability talk

1141
01:49:40.96 --> 01:49:45.92
about humility and here we go people often asked us what is the most important trade of any leader

1142
01:49:45.92 --> 01:49:53.44
without a doubt it's humility the US army a 244 year old institution credited with training

1143
01:49:53.44 --> 01:49:56.96
some of our nation's most prominent leaders and practically writing the leadership manual for

1144
01:49:56.96 --> 01:50:02.32
leaders in any field recently added humility as one of the key attributes of good leaders to the

1145
01:50:02.32 --> 01:50:08.40
army doctrine publication six tack 22 saying a leader with the right level of humility is a

1146
01:50:08.40 --> 01:50:13.84
willing learner maintains accurate self awareness and seeks out others input and feedback

1147
01:50:13.84 --> 01:50:22.40
and this is something that one day on our echelon front ops call I said hey I've got something to

1148
01:50:22.40 --> 01:50:26.48
tell everyone in this group we've been talking about humility as the most important characteristic

1149
01:50:26.48 --> 01:50:32.64
for a leader for the past 13 years or whatever was 12 years at the time and the army just added

1150
01:50:32.64 --> 01:50:36.16
this to their manual which is freaking awesome because those characters extend and changed for a

1151
01:50:36.16 --> 01:50:42.72
long long time in the army but they realized if you're not humble you got problems I just want to say

1152
01:50:42.72 --> 01:50:47.68
plagiarism is one of the high forms of flattery so if you bring your lawyers at me we will go

1153
01:50:47.68 --> 01:50:54.000
to tell a lot of this is taken from my mentors I did not credit you in certain spots

1154
01:50:55.76 --> 01:51:01.60
it goes back to Johnny and I think the military as a whole there was a point where we viewed

1155
01:51:01.60 --> 01:51:09.60
humility as weakness and I think at a young age I miss took somebody like Johnny who's just one of

1156
01:51:09.60 --> 01:51:18.80
the most humble dudes he still is as a slight form of weakness it's funny that the army I think

1157
01:51:18.80 --> 01:51:24.32
sort of has morphed as well their their view on that the criticality of humility

1158
01:51:25.36 --> 01:51:30.24
yeah no no doubt about it and you also realize after you know you've realized

1159
01:51:31.76 --> 01:51:35.68
the thing that pointed this out to me strong did anything else was when we were fire a guy

1160
01:51:35.68 --> 01:51:40.88
that was going through my training we would be firing that person if they want a leadership position

1161
01:51:40.88 --> 01:51:44.88
if they want a leadership position they could get fired for safety or a number of anything

1162
01:51:44.88 --> 01:51:49.44
any other things but if they were getting fired from a leadership position they were generally

1163
01:51:49.44 --> 01:51:53.36
having safety problems they weren't having they knew how to shoot their gun they were in good

1164
01:51:53.36 --> 01:51:57.44
physical condition they were getting fired because they lack humility which meant they weren't

1165
01:51:57.44 --> 01:52:00.32
listening to anybody else they weren't listening to the critique from their own

1166
01:52:00.32 --> 01:52:03.84
platoon they weren't listening to advice from their platoon chief or from their task in the

1167
01:52:03.84 --> 01:52:07.92
corner anyone else I definitely not the freaking training contract so they're just a disaster

1168
01:52:09.76 --> 01:52:16.32
and I have to bring up a comment a youtube comment okay so the Johnny Kim podcast

1169
01:52:17.04 --> 01:52:21.52
on youtube and it says something like you know the title of the podcast is

1170
01:52:21.52 --> 01:52:33.92
Johnny Kim you know seal sniper harver doctor astronaut and the first comment on youtube is

1171
01:52:34.88 --> 01:52:40.08
dude can't hold a job which I thought was pretty funny

1172
01:52:43.20 --> 01:52:48.40
integrity you guys talk about integrity I mean these you go through these characteristics kind of

1173
01:52:48.40 --> 01:52:53.84
each one effective intelligence talks to me about effective intelligence what was effective

1174
01:52:53.84 --> 01:52:59.52
intelligence compared to just plain old intelligence and I hope this has something to do with the fact

1175
01:52:59.52 --> 01:53:07.68
that speaking of acquiring people there was a time in the late 90s where in the seal teams in the

1176
01:53:07.68 --> 01:53:13.36
officer community I wasn't an officer yet but they were the seals were starting to get popular

1177
01:53:13.36 --> 01:53:20.40
and they started getting really good candidates for the officer program and so they started recruiting

1178
01:53:20.40 --> 01:53:27.20
and beyond just recruiting they started accepting all these just Ivy League Ivy League

1179
01:53:27.20 --> 01:53:32.40
individuals you meet every every every new group of officers that we show up the seal team

1180
01:53:33.28 --> 01:53:37.68
you know there'd be a bunch of enable academy guys because they get a bunch of the billets every year

1181
01:53:37.68 --> 01:53:44.000
and then there'd be a bunch of guys from freaking harvered and and jail and these really smart guys and

1182
01:53:46.64 --> 01:53:50.32
maybe they didn't have and I'm not saying this about every because some of them were great guys

1183
01:53:50.32 --> 01:53:55.20
but not all of them have what I'm hoping is referred to in this book as effective intelligence

1184
01:53:55.20 --> 01:54:00.48
is that someone accurate it is I'm gonna take one step back so integrity I know we sort of

1185
01:54:00.48 --> 01:54:05.84
glossed over that Josh cotton doctor cotton is very passionate about this one he's done a lot of

1186
01:54:05.84 --> 01:54:12.08
studies and look at the data organizations that are in you know high ethics or highly you know

1187
01:54:12.08 --> 01:54:19.28
high in integrity the culture is much healthier than organizations that don't and I know that's

1188
01:54:19.28 --> 01:54:26.32
sort of an obvious statement but you look at Enron yeah and I think also you you you say it seems like

1189
01:54:26.32 --> 01:54:31.52
an obvious statement and yet there's so many organizations that let those things slide and here's

1190
01:54:31.52 --> 01:54:37.36
the problem with letting things slide when it comes to integrity once this is you know this slippery

1191
01:54:37.36 --> 01:54:42.08
slope sometimes they say a slippery slope fallacy because you know well just because I did this

1192
01:54:42.08 --> 01:54:46.88
doesn't really mean I'm gonna do that the slippery slope when it comes to integrity is I think

1193
01:54:46.88 --> 01:54:53.52
is almost unstoppable thing because you know if I let echo get away with something well now he's got

1194
01:54:53.52 --> 01:54:58.80
something on me and now he lets me get away with something we go back and forth we go on this downward

1195
01:54:58.80 --> 01:55:05.84
spiral and there's no one that can I once I once I give up my integrity I give up my ability to

1196
01:55:05.84 --> 01:55:11.60
tighten anyone else's integrity up and you've also said a new standard you've put your personal

1197
01:55:11.60 --> 01:55:17.52
stamp on approval the that behavior is now tolerated yep and you that's what makes it so hard you can't

1198
01:55:17.52 --> 01:55:22.88
go backwards yeah you can't unring that bell it's really hard to do with all and if you have to go backwards

1199
01:55:22.88 --> 01:55:27.76
because look you can put yourself in a situation what do you do you own it you stand up in front of

1200
01:55:27.76 --> 01:55:31.52
the troops you say hey look I made a bad decision this is a bad personal decision I thought this

1201
01:55:31.52 --> 01:55:36.16
was a good thing to do it didn't make sense it was the wrong thing I won't let it happen again

1202
01:55:36.16 --> 01:55:40.56
that might be you know that's your that's your first step in trying to recover your integrity

1203
01:55:40.56 --> 01:55:47.04
yeah but when you give it up that's why it's so you know the moral high ground the moral high ground

1204
01:55:47.04 --> 01:55:52.16
and keeping the high ground it's talked about this the other day on EF online it's like

1205
01:55:52.16 --> 01:55:59.76
once you give up the moral high ground it's just like being in combat you now you now are going

1206
01:55:59.76 --> 01:56:04.80
to have to fight to get it back and it's a freaking uphill battle and there's a good chance

1207
01:56:04.80 --> 01:56:11.76
you can't get up there anymore so you cannot give up that moral and ethical high ground it just

1208
01:56:11.76 --> 01:56:15.84
it's it's one of the worst possible moves you can make on the battlefield and it's one of the

1209
01:56:15.84 --> 01:56:20.24
worst possible moves you can make in life so I didn't mean to breeze over integrity like that

1210
01:56:20.24 --> 01:56:26.64
but no doubt it's a it's a core component of what you got to be looking for in people

1211
01:56:26.64 --> 01:56:31.60
and people don't scream for it that's the weirdest thing nobody ever asked the

1212
01:56:31.60 --> 01:56:36.48
well I should say nobody I want to be careful on extremes there but I've watched you know

1213
01:56:36.48 --> 01:56:40.32
the predominance of the hiring I do I manage a team but most of the hiring that I'm looking

1214
01:56:40.32 --> 01:56:43.84
after is executive level and you know all of these offers come by and you're talking

1215
01:56:43.84 --> 01:56:49.52
half million cash and more I mean they're their significant compensation and I don't

1216
01:56:49.52 --> 01:56:56.80
hear anybody ask the question can you give me an example of when you had the hold the line on

1217
01:56:56.80 --> 01:57:03.12
integrity and take the harder path even just that simple question you won't hear it in an

1218
01:57:03.12 --> 01:57:09.12
interview process it would it would shock me if I heard it but it is so fundamental if you don't

1219
01:57:09.12 --> 01:57:15.76
have this the rest doesn't matter if there's if the integrity's gone that's it you you cannot

1220
01:57:15.76 --> 01:57:20.000
have a person without integrity in your organization full stop what was interesting is we were

1221
01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:25.92
writing this book as so calm was dealing with a number of ethical issues and let's be asked a

1222
01:57:25.92 --> 01:57:31.60
lot of them were coming from the CO community and you know we we sort of struggled hey do we have

1223
01:57:31.60 --> 01:57:36.24
to change in the language in here but you know one individual doesn't speak for the organization

1224
01:57:37.04 --> 01:57:42.08
but they do when they're on the front lines or front pages front page they speak for your

1225
01:57:42.08 --> 01:57:49.12
organization and you know you mentioned Ivy League and and I feel bad sometimes because I overindex

1226
01:57:49.12 --> 01:57:54.16
on Ivy League guys and sometimes I'm critical there there were some great CO officers that came out

1227
01:57:54.16 --> 01:58:00.64
for certainly for sure some outstanding guys no doubt but they were more the exception than the

1228
01:58:00.64 --> 01:58:08.88
the norm so as I'm talking to Johnny Kim Johnny was like speaking Harvard that was after he

1229
01:58:08.88 --> 01:58:13.60
became a CEO so he gets a he gets a pass and and Johnny brought up a story in my life where I'm

1230
01:58:13.60 --> 01:58:18.08
like Johnny that's that's not a good story so you know we're talking about buzz we're talking

1231
01:58:18.08 --> 01:58:21.36
about Ryan and him and I or you know you could tell we're getting a little emotional on the phone

1232
01:58:21.36 --> 01:58:28.56
he's like hey you remember that time we had a Harvard officer in our Buds class who actually

1233
01:58:28.56 --> 01:58:34.08
worked for N-Ron but some officer you know I don't know what what what what the fascination was it like

1234
01:58:34.08 --> 01:58:40.80
all this guy went to Harvard news with that run and you know in these in Buds and um this guy was

1235
01:58:41.84 --> 01:58:48.64
arguably one of the smartest guys in the class now as part of Johnny um and he said that's nice

1236
01:58:48.64 --> 01:58:57.44
this guy just alienated everyone he thought he was the smartest man in the room and he was

1237
01:58:57.44 --> 01:59:03.92
egotistical he was an a-hole and Johnny's like so he's done the story about we're running to the

1238
01:59:03.92 --> 01:59:11.04
chowhole and still there's like 250 to 125 people in the class in this guy knew I was a recon Marine

1239
01:59:11.04 --> 01:59:17.04
and you know sometimes you'll run the formation there's one guy that runs to the right of the

1240
01:59:17.04 --> 01:59:22.08
is it the left of the left left this is my yeah for marine that's pretty embarrassing so we're

1241
01:59:22.08 --> 01:59:26.96
gonna do the left but his hands up the wall and makes an elder left one and he's singing cadence

1242
01:59:26.96 --> 01:59:32.08
and he's just ripping on recon and Johnny's laughing on the phone because the whole class saw

1243
01:59:32.08 --> 01:59:37.60
this guy just fall out of the main formation run out and I just took a hand you know sort of the

1244
01:59:37.60 --> 01:59:43.28
night not the night hand but the hard hand was there over not to slap not to helmet right off his uh

1245
01:59:43.28 --> 01:59:46.32
his head and he goes wrong across the street and he has to run over and I just took over the

1246
01:59:46.32 --> 01:59:52.88
cadence and I'm like Johnny that was not my best man but this guy I kind of liked that moment this

1247
01:59:52.88 --> 01:59:59.52
guy was uh he was gonna make it through a hurry he was gonna meet the physical requirements

1248
01:59:59.52 --> 02:00:04.72
in the mental toughness requirements but the cotter a stepped in and dropped him and that's rare

1249
02:00:05.44 --> 02:00:13.04
because he was just that toxic it that toxic and it's funny that the instructors could recognize

1250
02:00:13.04 --> 02:00:16.72
that because usually instructors like hey he meets all these requirements we can breathe that out of them

1251
02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:25.04
effective intelligence is the ability to use the intelligence you have in a real world setting

1252
02:00:25.04 --> 02:00:31.84
to solve problems for which there is no playbook and that is the heart of special operations

1253
02:00:32.24 --> 02:00:36.96
so there you know we found a study what would you guess it was the average GPA of most

1254
02:00:36.96 --> 02:00:44.24
millionaires that went to college I have no idea 2.9 2.9 and that's my seven graces because I think

1255
02:00:44.24 --> 02:00:51.92
I got a 2.9 on it so I'm like hey Abby so what we found in the people that are off the charts

1256
02:00:51.92 --> 02:00:55.76
smart and what we saw in the seal teams is that they suffered a lot from the process through

1257
02:00:55.76 --> 02:01:02.24
analysis or they made things so overly complex and when you work in high-staking environments

1258
02:01:02.24 --> 02:01:10.72
time is usually a factor and it goes back to the second law of combat simple yeah that's that's

1259
02:01:10.72 --> 02:01:17.04
all good stuff and again hey we're not bagging on the guys that came in and had awesome education

1260
02:01:17.04 --> 02:01:21.12
and a lot of them were awesome and and here's another another reason that it hurt the community

1261
02:01:21.12 --> 02:01:25.44
was because these guys would be coming in and they were had such high potential this is in the

1262
02:01:25.44 --> 02:01:30.48
90s there's no war going on they do four years they get they do their system of

1263
02:01:30.48 --> 02:01:34.56
two commander they do their putton commander they look at what's ahead of them in the 90s and it was like oh

1264
02:01:34.56 --> 02:01:39.44
you're gonna you're gonna you're gonna you're gonna you know ride a desk for the next 18 or whatever the

1265
02:01:39.44 --> 02:01:42.96
next 16 years before you can retire and guys would say you know I'm gonna get out and I'm gonna go

1266
02:01:43.52 --> 02:01:48.40
do do something else so it hurt us from a just a personnel building standpoint as well

1267
02:01:49.04 --> 02:01:52.32
but that's uh the other thing that I've seen is where you get

1268
02:01:54.000 --> 02:01:58.32
and look some people pull this off and they do it great but there are some people that have a problem

1269
02:01:58.32 --> 02:02:06.16
taking their highly intellectual view of something and translating it to the frontline troops

1270
02:02:06.16 --> 02:02:10.96
where now the people the people that have to go and execute whatever did you want them to execute

1271
02:02:11.52 --> 02:02:15.52
is doing it in a simple clear concise right that's why simple is one of the laws of combat

1272
02:02:16.08 --> 02:02:20.24
but you know part of the law of combat is planning keep your your planning simple the other

1273
02:02:20.24 --> 02:02:24.72
part of that law of combat is to communicate simply and there's a lot of people that have a hard time

1274
02:02:24.72 --> 02:02:29.44
doing not a lot there are some people that have a hard time doing that so that's a

1275
02:02:30.32 --> 02:02:35.60
that effective intelligence is uh is definitely an important thing and that is the one I mean

1276
02:02:35.60 --> 02:02:40.56
one of the attributes specific to Marsauk is that they called it effective intelligence and that's you know

1277
02:02:40.56 --> 02:02:46.000
again flint we we we took that one it was the way they described it in their assessment and

1278
02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:50.08
selection manual that that's one of their primary requirements the way they described it was absolutely

1279
02:02:50.08 --> 02:02:57.92
beautiful. Marsauk had the advantage of having joined so calm late you know I was a recon marine

1280
02:02:57.92 --> 02:03:03.60
we were never part of so calm back then and eventually 2000 was at five six Marsauk that one

1281
02:03:03.60 --> 02:03:08.24
led by Colonel Kaczynski two 2004 yeah because they were leave me and Baghdad that's right

1282
02:03:08.24 --> 02:03:14.80
and everyone's like yeah this is a no-brainer but they could look when they were building the Marsauk

1283
02:03:14.80 --> 02:03:19.44
assessment selection course they could look at what the sealer and the SF community and they were very

1284
02:03:19.44 --> 02:03:23.52
deliberate and that's the Marsauk community stand by they're they're they're just going to be

1285
02:03:23.52 --> 02:03:29.52
powerful they already are yeah you know we were talking about to bring this over to the business world

1286
02:03:29.52 --> 02:03:36.000
you know we talk about effective intelligence and people over indexing on experience they're

1287
02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:43.04
wanting people to come and take a playbook and run it over here and and assuming that the situations

1288
02:03:43.04 --> 02:03:48.80
that you're going to find in this particular business are going to be exactly the same and so

1289
02:03:48.80 --> 02:03:53.20
they're thinking well they've handled these situations over here they'll be able to handle them here

1290
02:03:53.20 --> 02:04:00.88
will be successful in the story it's the effective intelligence that's not assuming any course of action

1291
02:04:01.44 --> 02:04:07.68
for a business problem they're looking at it that that ability to take the intellectual horsepower

1292
02:04:07.68 --> 02:04:12.88
and look at all of the data points all of the indicators all of the little pieces of intel

1293
02:04:12.88 --> 02:04:21.12
collect them and put them into a cohesive picture that then you explain simply with the plan of attack

1294
02:04:21.76 --> 02:04:27.36
and it's so different than experience and if we can get people to index on that versus the experience

1295
02:04:28.16 --> 02:04:31.84
you see the difference immediately you know George we actually we talk about the 70%

1296
02:04:31.84 --> 02:04:36.96
solution that's a great example what you're you're explaining in a business context is again

1297
02:04:36.96 --> 02:04:41.76
the guys that are wildly intelligent when they only have 70% of the operational picture they can't

1298
02:04:41.76 --> 02:04:50.40
make a decision but people high in high effective intelligence can draw threads parallels and make a

1299
02:04:50.40 --> 02:04:54.80
very decisive decision with interplayed information and you know they we pulled a quote out

1300
02:04:54.80 --> 02:04:59.28
because we're talking to Tracy Kio and so she was talking about the CEO of Microsoft

1301
02:04:59.28 --> 02:05:07.36
said we don't want no adults we want learn adults if you can get that how far ahead of the game are you

1302
02:05:07.36 --> 02:05:13.60
I'm gonna I'm gonna reach into some people's brains that are listening to this right now

1303
02:05:13.60 --> 02:05:18.72
and I'm just gonna do a little a little tweak on their brains because I promise you I promise you

1304
02:05:18.72 --> 02:05:25.28
that there's some people that when you said hey you're talking about someone that just takes a playbook

1305
02:05:25.28 --> 02:05:30.48
and runs the playbook and that's it I promise you that there's some people that are thinking wait that's

1306
02:05:30.48 --> 02:05:33.60
what I want that's what I want right there I want someone who's gonna take that playbook and they're

1307
02:05:33.60 --> 02:05:38.16
gonna run that's what they're gonna do and and I'm gonna reach in there and just I have to stop you

1308
02:05:38.16 --> 02:05:43.68
from thinking that because I know that's what you think you want that's what that's what leaders think

1309
02:05:43.68 --> 02:05:47.68
they think hey look I've got this all figured out if everyone would just do what I tell them to do

1310
02:05:47.68 --> 02:05:53.92
run the playbook just do what I say to do will be good to go here's the thing there's no static

1311
02:05:53.92 --> 02:06:04.24
function in the world that what you want is non-thinking apparatus to run a playbook and if you do

1312
02:06:04.24 --> 02:06:08.96
if you have something like that yes automate that get a robot to do that task and do them

1313
02:06:08.96 --> 02:06:13.92
over and over again the same way when you're hiding a leader you want them to be able to adapt

1314
02:06:13.92 --> 02:06:19.60
and change and make improvements and do whatever they have to do to win that's what you want so if you

1315
02:06:19.60 --> 02:06:26.08
hear George say hey we don't want someone that's just gonna run the playbook and you're thinking

1316
02:06:26.08 --> 02:06:31.36
no way I do that do want that no you don't and this was the same thing is happen to the

1317
02:06:31.36 --> 02:06:36.32
micro managers coming through my train when I was running training you get someone that's thinking hey

1318
02:06:36.32 --> 02:06:41.44
look I've been I'm either I'm experienced or I know I'm highly educated I know how to run these

1319
02:06:41.44 --> 02:06:45.28
operations so everyone if everyone just get in line and just do what I tell them to do will be

1320
02:06:45.28 --> 02:06:49.76
good to go and what is that turned into it's micro management that you can't tell everyone what to do

1321
02:06:49.76 --> 02:06:53.52
there's no way you can be everywhere or once and everything falls apart you need thinking shooters

1322
02:06:53.52 --> 02:07:01.28
is what we used to call it so what what we're offering at at EF Overwatch is thinking leaders that will

1323
02:07:01.28 --> 02:07:06.96
actually solve problems yeah you're right and and you know we made a little vignette a little video about this

1324
02:07:08.16 --> 02:07:13.28
but coming up through the army and you know joccal I was actually one of those people that

1325
02:07:13.28 --> 02:07:18.56
started to get out in the 90s I was I'd gotten through you know I had two years of line command

1326
02:07:18.56 --> 02:07:23.60
and I'm thinking I love this I got to go to field I love being with my soldiers and then you

1327
02:07:23.60 --> 02:07:27.04
didn't you know your time for a command comes up in the army and you're looking ahead and you're going

1328
02:07:27.92 --> 02:07:31.76
now I'm gonna say something and I don't want to hear crap about it later Mike but I'm thinking

1329
02:07:31.76 --> 02:07:37.44
I got a life of Harvard graphics ahead of me which preceded powerpoint just to bring you along

1330
02:07:37.44 --> 02:07:48.000
with the program here but and and so I got out but I have to tell you the US army and the US military

1331
02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:55.52
is the world's greatest leadership incubator and I owe so much back to the military to my mentors

1332
02:07:55.52 --> 02:08:00.48
to my coaches to the soldiers to the non-commissioned officers people I served with and it created

1333
02:08:00.48 --> 02:08:08.96
and made that thinking leader do I have all the answers no no but that the US military when we

1334
02:08:08.96 --> 02:08:15.28
talk about it yet folks we talk about placing leaders it's you're in a fishbowl 247 365 is a

1335
02:08:15.28 --> 02:08:21.20
leader it is the biggest and best burden you can ever carry is to be a leader in the United States

1336
02:08:21.20 --> 02:08:26.96
military it is just it's an honor a privilege it's scariest how it's rewarding is how it's everything

1337
02:08:26.96 --> 02:08:34.64
but you're in an incubator to lead and and I am so so grateful for that and and so when we talk

1338
02:08:34.64 --> 02:08:39.68
about the principles in these book and when we talk about that effective intelligence the army

1339
02:08:39.68 --> 02:08:45.04
helped me in my case deliver that that that did I know everything about the enemy no I had to take all

1340
02:08:45.04 --> 02:08:49.20
these cues and start putting pieces together what do I have to do what are my possible courses

1341
02:08:49.20 --> 02:08:56.16
of action what's good what's bad what's high risk what's low risk and anyway it just it is it is

1342
02:08:56.16 --> 02:09:01.52
astounded me how much I learned to think about the art of leadership coming through the US military

1343
02:09:02.48 --> 02:09:08.64
I mean muskets were not as intuitive during his days as you know for us we have now but we had good

1344
02:09:08.64 --> 02:09:12.80
horses like so you know I'm good with that this is what I have to put up with daily

1345
02:09:12.80 --> 02:09:20.96
team ability did you guys make up that work that hyphenated work team ability we did not

1346
02:09:21.60 --> 02:09:28.000
we I think we found that within our research we we we liked it so we we stuck with yeah kind of

1347
02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:30.56
because we were talking with Brian Decker we were talking a lot of people

1348
02:09:31.60 --> 02:09:36.40
that you everybody had different versions of that same word so we put that together yeah the

1349
02:09:36.40 --> 02:09:42.24
team work and how different and do you have the ability to put yourself whatever level you're at

1350
02:09:43.12 --> 02:09:47.44
as a team player and that there's a certain element of that to be a follower as well

1351
02:09:47.44 --> 02:09:51.68
what do we put everything like that word yeah okay yeah we came up with it

1352
02:09:51.68 --> 02:09:57.52
good ago you say about nothing worth accomplishing it can be done alone there are no

1353
02:09:57.52 --> 02:10:01.36
rampos in the military that might look cool in the movies but individual is die pretty quickly on

1354
02:10:01.36 --> 02:10:06.88
the battlefield or worst get others hurt they're great success requires that we work together

1355
02:10:07.52 --> 02:10:12.64
curiosity exploring the unknown and questioning the status quo and pursue to better

1356
02:10:12.64 --> 02:10:17.52
more effective solutions is the key to innovation without curious individuals nothing would ever

1357
02:10:17.52 --> 02:10:25.92
change or improve emotional strength in the US military and I'm given like these highly abbreviated

1358
02:10:25.92 --> 02:10:32.000
definitions and you guys go into it not not only do you go into better examples but then not only

1359
02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:37.52
not only more detailed definitions but examples you know you're talking about the rescue

1360
02:10:37.52 --> 02:10:42.48
cap and films I mean you got really cool examples in here to back these things up but that's

1361
02:10:42.48 --> 02:10:47.52
where people buy the books so that they can read those curiosity already covered that emotional strength

1362
02:10:48.16 --> 02:10:54.88
in the US military the whole man concept is the belief that the individuals need to be assessed

1363
02:10:54.88 --> 02:11:00.24
based on the entirety of their person mental physical and emotional and emotionally strong individual

1364
02:11:00.24 --> 02:11:06.80
has a positive attitude high empathy and emotional control in stressful situations many of the

1365
02:11:06.80 --> 02:11:12.56
individuals we interviewed identified positive attitude as important to their hiring decisions

1366
02:11:12.56 --> 02:11:18.64
attitude is contagious positivity breeds positivity while negativity

1367
02:11:18.64 --> 02:11:24.80
be gets more negativity an individual the negative attitude can still produce results but is often at the expense

1368
02:11:24.80 --> 02:11:31.04
of company culture typically that one person who's also not worth the resulting damage to the team

1369
02:11:33.76 --> 02:11:38.88
you have highlighted this section emotional strength is the ability to regulate ones emotions

1370
02:11:38.88 --> 02:11:44.64
to remain logical under stress situations marsawk calls this stress tolerance and defines it as

1371
02:11:44.64 --> 02:11:50.000
the ability to deal with ambiguous dangerous high pressure or frustrating events while maintaining control

1372
02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:56.32
of emotions actions composure and effectiveness it is a universal truth in life that humans don't

1373
02:11:56.32 --> 02:12:01.52
make good decisions in emotional state people who are able to remain cool calm and collected in the

1374
02:12:01.52 --> 02:12:06.40
face of challenges and the unknown are people you want in your organization this is the exact reason

1375
02:12:06.40 --> 02:12:11.20
soft creates stressful environments to mimic the conditions of war during assessment and selection

1376
02:12:11.20 --> 02:12:16.16
programs stress tolerance is so important that some soft organizations even use heart rate

1377
02:12:16.16 --> 02:12:23.92
monitors to evaluate individuals psychological physiological responses to stress

1378
02:12:26.96 --> 02:12:33.76
got to stay calm got to be able to detach these were this chapter I mean you get people that

1379
02:12:33.76 --> 02:12:37.68
are very passionate Ryan Decker was heavily involved in this chapter rich divinity

1380
02:12:37.68 --> 02:12:44.40
geverserved with rich I did not rich is a brother very very passionate about in fact he has a book

1381
02:12:44.40 --> 02:12:50.000
called the attributes 25 hidden drivers of optimal performance it's about attributes some of his

1382
02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:54.40
observations like empathy you know when you think about it in the way he described it he said

1383
02:12:55.04 --> 02:13:01.04
special operations is very good about dialing up and dialing down empathy he said it's almost like

1384
02:13:01.04 --> 02:13:06.24
a dimmer switch when you go out on an operation in your right in the home there's a likelihood

1385
02:13:06.24 --> 02:13:10.88
that there are women and children in there and you know you've got a dial down or empathy to

1386
02:13:10.88 --> 02:13:15.76
accomplish the mission not you know safeguard them while while still bringing the hurt to the

1387
02:13:15.76 --> 02:13:20.24
the combatants you're known after um yet we're very good about down that empathy back up when we

1388
02:13:20.24 --> 02:13:27.92
come back from from from uh operations so um very detailed conversations very passionate about these

1389
02:13:27.92 --> 02:13:34.72
these subjects and um those two were instrumental in uh in the chapter yeah you guys dug into

1390
02:13:34.72 --> 02:13:40.56
some like I said good stuff and obviously going with getting those dead information for good people

1391
02:13:42.96 --> 02:13:52.80
creating a talent acquisition plan talk to me about that well you know one of the many

1392
02:13:52.80 --> 02:13:58.40
mistakes that you know once you get past you know making sure that your chief human resources

1393
02:13:58.40 --> 02:14:04.64
chief human resource officer is strategic and tied into your CEO you have to look

1394
02:14:04.64 --> 02:14:13.52
ahead you know at that old adage if you if you fail to plan you're planning to fail people look

1395
02:14:13.52 --> 02:14:18.88
at talent and recruiting and staffing is hey we've got these open positions let's crank it there's

1396
02:14:18.88 --> 02:14:25.20
not often a plan behind it and that starts with looking at your company and it starts with going okay

1397
02:14:25.20 --> 02:14:31.12
what is the strength of our company when it comes to talent what gaps do we have what gaps do we

1398
02:14:31.12 --> 02:14:35.76
have in leadership what gaps do we have in technology what gaps do we have in sales in leaders

1399
02:14:35.76 --> 02:14:41.36
in individual contributors do we have key points of failure do we have only one person that can do

1400
02:14:41.36 --> 02:14:46.72
this job and if they go we've nobody to step up do we have number two do we have number three

1401
02:14:47.28 --> 02:14:52.80
okay where are we gonna grow where are we gonna grow next year and you know this could go on and on

1402
02:14:52.80 --> 02:14:58.32
and on but the basics are is you need to be sitting down and looking at each organization and what

1403
02:14:58.32 --> 02:15:03.92
are you missing why are you winning in that department why are you winning in sales why are you winning

1404
02:15:03.92 --> 02:15:08.40
in product why are you winning in service or whatever and find out what your gaps are and that's

1405
02:15:08.40 --> 02:15:14.000
where you start with talent and get that down into a plan that says okay we're gonna go after this

1406
02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:19.60
in a strategic way we are gonna go out into the market you know we're gonna look within our own

1407
02:15:19.60 --> 02:15:23.92
organization first but then we're gonna go out to the market and we're gonna build an organization

1408
02:15:23.92 --> 02:15:29.76
in talent acquisition HR that says these are the people that are the gatekeepers and they are

1409
02:15:29.76 --> 02:15:34.32
going to find and they are gonna know what our success profiles look like and they are gonna

1410
02:15:34.32 --> 02:15:40.48
bring us high caliber people with those character attributes to be considered for these positions

1411
02:15:40.48 --> 02:15:46.24
but you plan it out first is going oh you know what hey we have an open position over here you

1412
02:15:46.24 --> 02:15:51.20
know we've authorized 10 head count in this particular department you've got an empty seat what

1413
02:15:51.20 --> 02:15:55.44
do you need that's not a plan that's just that's a button to see like we talked about

1414
02:15:56.40 --> 02:16:02.64
you you have to take that time to say what does my organization look like as far as talent and people

1415
02:16:02.64 --> 02:16:06.48
it's one of the many things that because everybody's focused on everything else they don't take the

1416
02:16:06.48 --> 02:16:13.04
time to go what's gonna bring us into 21 what's gonna bring us into 22 you and like Don Roberts

1417
02:16:13.04 --> 02:16:17.84
and said in our book you have to be higher for the skills and needs of the future where your company

1418
02:16:17.84 --> 02:16:22.24
is gonna go and I think we even brought it up it's like the term is fighting in the last war

1419
02:16:23.04 --> 02:16:26.96
you know you're not thinking ahead is to what you're gonna need and so there's no plan to go

1420
02:16:26.96 --> 02:16:32.16
after that and build that for the future this is one of those things where you it happens to

1421
02:16:32.16 --> 02:16:37.12
echelon front sometimes be working with a company and and you know they're whatever company is

1422
02:16:37.12 --> 02:16:40.32
it happens all the time companies caught up in that firefight day to day they're trying to survive

1423
02:16:40.32 --> 02:16:44.32
they're trying to make things happen they got projects do they got all the things going on and then

1424
02:16:44.32 --> 02:16:49.20
you know you ask them about you know hey do you do you have anyone that's looking at you know

1425
02:16:50.16 --> 02:16:54.24
six months down the line about where you're gonna be about what supplies you're gonna need or whatever

1426
02:16:54.24 --> 02:16:59.12
just whatever those and and you can see their caught their caught like on their heels because they don't

1427
02:16:59.92 --> 02:17:05.52
and if you if you think about what you're talking about here a talent acquisition plan how we're

1428
02:17:05.52 --> 02:17:10.64
actually going to build a company and you think about how many companies are out there

1429
02:17:10.64 --> 02:17:17.36
that the way they think about is just it's a fire fight right we need to fill this seat right now

1430
02:17:17.36 --> 02:17:22.40
that's the plan the plan is hire someone to do that role next week we have a new plan the plan is

1431
02:17:22.40 --> 02:17:27.28
hire someone to keep fill this other role yep there's no unified long-term strategic plan of what we're

1432
02:17:27.28 --> 02:17:32.000
doing and what is the military do better than well there's many things they do better than most

1433
02:17:32.96 --> 02:17:38.32
there's always a pipeline there's always a pipeline there's always a plan there's a succession plan

1434
02:17:38.32 --> 02:17:44.96
there is a pipeline of high quality people coming into a pipeline so we can assess and select and put them into

1435
02:17:44.96 --> 02:17:50.88
those things it's it's a forethought we have people that are out there doing that stuff but they're actually

1436
02:17:50.88 --> 02:17:57.84
thinking what do we need for 21 22 23 24 25 won't even that goes all the way out the systems in equipment

1437
02:17:58.88 --> 02:18:04.40
and but the military does it all whereas corporations will go to your point they're out there firefighting

1438
02:18:04.40 --> 02:18:09.28
oh wow wow I've got an opening on team I got to bring somebody in but if you do have an opening on

1439
02:18:09.28 --> 02:18:13.04
your team it should be hey we got a pipeline already talent that's banging out the door to get

1440
02:18:13.04 --> 02:18:18.40
into this place because we have a talent mindset we have leadership we are focused we empower our

1441
02:18:18.40 --> 02:18:23.76
people we lead our people we drive our people we win and people will want to be a part of that

1442
02:18:23.76 --> 02:18:28.96
yeah you guys break it down and hear what you have to do what you have to do to create this

1443
02:18:28.96 --> 02:18:33.12
talent acquisition plan defining greatness in your organization identify your high performance

1444
02:18:33.12 --> 02:18:39.12
as a session talent objective assessments just you guys go line by line and explain all these things

1445
02:18:39.12 --> 02:18:44.24
in great detail build your talent profiles mic you already mentioned that workforce plan I mean you

1446
02:18:44.24 --> 02:18:50.64
just go through the detail so that people that don't have a plan can actually open up this book

1447
02:18:51.20 --> 02:18:57.84
and put a plan together so that they're moving forward with a route right with a route instead

1448
02:18:57.84 --> 02:19:03.92
of just moving forward in the blind which is crazy to think about and yet it happens all the time it's

1449
02:19:03.92 --> 02:19:10.32
just start with the conversation the senior leaders and companies are not having this conversation

1450
02:19:10.32 --> 02:19:14.96
and that's where it starts there's many ways to go about this you don't need to bring you know

1451
02:19:14.96 --> 02:19:18.80
bring in a top five consulting firm yes you can bring in the info for watching that's my plug

1452
02:19:19.52 --> 02:19:23.84
but you know this this isn't something where you're going to bring in you know industrial

1453
02:19:23.84 --> 02:19:27.76
organizational psychologists and you're going to create assessments that are going to solve this for you

1454
02:19:27.76 --> 02:19:32.64
this is this is this is basic leadership that you have to have the discipline to fall through on

1455
02:19:32.64 --> 02:19:37.36
and you can create these processes from scratch special operations community how to start somewhere

1456
02:19:37.36 --> 02:19:41.36
they basically started from scratch and you can build this it's going to take time

1457
02:19:41.36 --> 02:19:45.12
but you have to have those conversations and you have to have those conversations all the time

1458
02:19:45.12 --> 02:19:51.44
every every week every month are we selecting not only for what we need now but five years

1459
02:19:51.44 --> 02:19:56.72
don't mind if you're creating a town profile how does that top profile change with the digital

1460
02:19:56.72 --> 02:20:01.12
transformation five years from now what's going to be required in terms of attributes five years

1461
02:20:01.12 --> 02:20:12.96
down the road or ten years down the road? Next section is about attracting top talent what talented

1462
02:20:12.96 --> 02:20:18.000
people look for attracting talent requires knowing what talented people want many companies assume

1463
02:20:18.000 --> 02:20:21.76
that the answer is money and perks they offer competitive salaries and wonderful

1464
02:20:21.76 --> 02:20:26.88
creature comforts high end expression machines fully stocked kitchens pool tables and more

1465
02:20:27.76 --> 02:20:32.72
and yet they still have rich talent on the other end we've seen countless people turn down

1466
02:20:32.72 --> 02:20:37.84
higher pay to stay with the company where they feel challenged and love the people they work with

1467
02:20:37.84 --> 02:20:43.44
if you want people to dedicate their talents to your company you must offer something equally

1468
02:20:43.44 --> 02:20:48.88
valuable in return since talented people have high drive they are interested they're just as

1469
02:20:48.88 --> 02:20:54.16
interested in achievement and challenge as money let's not fool ourselves if your compensation

1470
02:20:54.16 --> 02:20:58.96
benefits are not competitive within your industry you'll lose out on talent but attracting top

1471
02:20:58.96 --> 02:21:03.92
people goes beyond that beyond money talented people look for talented leaders and colleagues

1472
02:21:03.92 --> 02:21:09.60
a sense of community a challenge opportunities for professional and personal growth and purpose

1473
02:21:09.60 --> 02:21:17.04
talent attracts talent it's a magnet good leaders or you want to go even in my military career

1474
02:21:17.60 --> 02:21:21.92
I know who those good leaders are and I'm like oh I got to get that organization because they're

1475
02:21:21.92 --> 02:21:25.68
going to help me get to the next level they're going to pass on that experience that coaching the

1476
02:21:25.68 --> 02:21:29.84
mentorship I did that in the military I do it here in the corporate world I've been doing it for

1477
02:21:29.84 --> 02:21:34.48
20 years you know one of the people in this book I actually followed to another organization he's like hey

1478
02:21:34.48 --> 02:21:39.04
hey I'm like I'm there I'm there you know he goes do you want to talk about the

1479
02:21:39.04 --> 02:21:47.28
compensation I said no let's just move let's go and the great part is is that you know there's

1480
02:21:47.28 --> 02:21:54.24
a lot of bad habits that get you into a vicious cycle but attracting great talent gets you into a

1481
02:21:54.24 --> 02:22:02.32
positive cycle of attracting better talent all the time you're alumni in the people currently

1482
02:22:02.32 --> 02:22:09.52
in your organization are the best way to attract talent hands down I mean you're doing it right now

1483
02:22:09.52 --> 02:22:17.44
you've probably caused a lot of young men and women to in list or seek missions in the military

1484
02:22:17.44 --> 02:22:22.16
based off the lessons that are learning but yes that is a factual statement there we go there's a lot

1485
02:22:22.16 --> 02:22:28.16
of a lot of people out there that are straight up in the military from listening to podcast

1486
02:22:28.16 --> 02:22:32.40
because I hear from all the time it's awesome in fact we're having dinner last night Air Force

1487
02:22:32.40 --> 02:22:38.000
individual came up and said hey I follow everything you do thank you for what you do and then he

1488
02:22:38.000 --> 02:22:44.40
asks he handed me the phone said hey can you take a picture of Jack and I might say really he's like yeah

1489
02:22:44.40 --> 02:22:51.52
okay so you tell the story and this is a hundred percent true I didn't come from the military

1490
02:22:51.52 --> 02:22:58.56
lineage I didn't I'd seen the movies that they were pretty cool I thought the military was potentially a

1491
02:22:59.36 --> 02:23:05.60
path for me there was multiple paths the backup dancer from Madonna was just not going to be a

1492
02:23:05.60 --> 02:23:11.68
career that provided you know what I needed to live so I wouldn't know that it inside Joe it's

1493
02:23:11.68 --> 02:23:23.52
it's also frightening mental image I assure you there's a sequence on somewhere in his house so

1494
02:23:23.52 --> 02:23:30.16
18 and living in Colorado I ran into I'm not gonna mention his name which is called staff sergeant Ben

1495
02:23:30.72 --> 02:23:36.08
staff sergeant Ben was attending the University of Colorado on the meat set program which is the same

1496
02:23:36.08 --> 02:23:40.80
program I eventually attended a tech say them the Marine and Listic Commission education program

1497
02:23:40.80 --> 02:23:45.68
where they take the enlisted seven to get their degrees in the ultimately uh earn a commission

1498
02:23:46.24 --> 02:23:52.64
so I met Ben and at the age of 18 here you have the staff sergeant from the force recon community

1499
02:23:53.36 --> 02:24:00.16
and he was humbly confident he was articulate highly respectful to everyone what differentiated

1500
02:24:00.16 --> 02:24:05.36
him from the other Marines was even though he was you know this dual cool you know highly

1501
02:24:05.36 --> 02:24:11.44
decorated is he was actually nicer than the other Marines he had nothing to prove and physically

1502
02:24:11.44 --> 02:24:16.64
the whole man concept he was there he had a stature about him and when I made team I'm like

1503
02:24:17.60 --> 02:24:24.40
dude that guy's awesome that's who I want to be that's who I want to be and I mean to the point

1504
02:24:24.40 --> 02:24:30.80
where I enlisted in the Marine court have come a recon ring because of the image because of the

1505
02:24:30.80 --> 02:24:36.16
person the Marine court put forward in front of young men and women like me when you have strong

1506
02:24:36.16 --> 02:24:42.96
leaders stepping up representing their communities it it sends a very strong message to people

1507
02:24:42.96 --> 02:24:47.84
that I want to join that and it never changed when I went to infantry school you know seven

1508
02:24:47.84 --> 02:24:51.28
recon ring stepped in front of us and said who wants to screen the front recon and like oh my god it's

1509
02:24:51.28 --> 02:24:57.60
like seven staff sergeant Ben's and then when I finally met the seals you know walls in the

1510
02:24:57.60 --> 02:25:04.08
Marine court I'm like oh my god that's my next challenge and your alumni and current employees

1511
02:25:04.08 --> 02:25:11.76
or team members are your greatest recruiting to it always yeah I was I've had many conversations

1512
02:25:11.76 --> 02:25:18.32
with businesses as you know they're losing somebody somebody decide to leave and they start thinking

1513
02:25:18.32 --> 02:25:21.28
about we're gonna end them with the no compete we're gonna get them with this we're gonna get

1514
02:25:21.28 --> 02:25:28.000
them with that and I say I got a better idea why don't you wish them luck and thank them for what they

1515
02:25:28.000 --> 02:25:34.64
did while they were here and let them go about it away because if you send them out the door with a

1516
02:25:34.64 --> 02:25:39.52
kick in the ass they're not coming back if you send them out the door and say good luck it's been

1517
02:25:39.52 --> 02:25:43.60
great working with you first of all they're not gonna go out in the street and say you know oh

1518
02:25:43.60 --> 02:25:47.92
joc was a jerk you don't want to work for him it's gonna go I left them but they're good people

1519
02:25:47.92 --> 02:25:52.48
right and that those people will come back to you by the way I mean eventually they're gonna come back

1520
02:25:52.48 --> 02:25:56.24
because you know somebody is over the reason they're leaving us because if you're treating people

1521
02:25:56.24 --> 02:26:00.48
well the reason people are leaving us because someone is lying to them you know they're lying they're

1522
02:26:00.48 --> 02:26:06.56
giving them some lying that they're not gonna be able to uphold so when people are leaving it's

1523
02:26:06.56 --> 02:26:10.56
it's your alumni you got a treat them like you're alumni and say hey good luck let me know if you

1524
02:26:10.56 --> 02:26:14.64
never need anything you know even though you're working for a competitor it's all right you know

1525
02:26:14.64 --> 02:26:19.68
what are my friends yeah you know well we we took a one step further we have some of the uh

1526
02:26:19.68 --> 02:26:26.000
the just great members of my team about 90 days down the road they'll call them up where they went

1527
02:26:26.56 --> 02:26:32.08
hey how are things going for you hey was it everything that you expected I hope your

1528
02:26:32.08 --> 02:26:35.52
experiencing great success and it's everything because there's people that move along because

1529
02:26:35.52 --> 02:26:40.16
for whatever reason they're next challenge maybe somewhere else and you have to be accepting of that

1530
02:26:40.16 --> 02:26:45.12
and you and you have to to your point encourage that too and if you have good number two you're

1531
02:26:45.12 --> 02:26:49.84
falling you don't worry about it but reach out to somebody and say hey how are you doing you know what

1532
02:26:49.84 --> 02:26:53.76
hey if things aren't going well there hey give me a call give me a call because we love to have

1533
02:26:53.76 --> 02:26:58.40
it in your hair you wouldn't believe how many people are going you know what they don't have to admit

1534
02:26:58.40 --> 02:27:02.88
that they made a mistake they're going you know what it wasn't as good it wasn't as good

1535
02:27:03.92 --> 02:27:09.44
we we call we we call the ultimate litmus test it's if there's pride in the organization whether

1536
02:27:09.44 --> 02:27:14.72
you're with the organization at that time or whatever look at the Marine Corps when somebody says hey

1537
02:27:14.72 --> 02:27:19.68
you know what you do while I'm a former Marine they they're proclaimed proclaim that vice

1538
02:27:20.24 --> 02:27:25.68
somebody say hey I'm a I'm a coder no if if they're pride prideful in the organization they say

1539
02:27:25.68 --> 02:27:31.92
I'm a Googler and so when they identify with the organization it's one they're sort of identifying

1540
02:27:31.92 --> 02:27:36.88
that there's a talent oriented culture and that there's strong leadership at that company to the

1541
02:27:36.88 --> 02:27:41.92
point where they have a sense of pride and that becomes a talent magnet for other people at that

1542
02:27:41.92 --> 02:27:48.96
cocktail party that you said it so very powerful we we can't sort of over index on that one enough

1543
02:27:50.08 --> 02:27:56.56
no it it's just you know everybody in your company is a talent scout everybody in your company is an

1544
02:27:56.56 --> 02:28:03.44
example of what you hold as important especially your leaders when they're out in the public

1545
02:28:03.44 --> 02:28:09.44
and everybody should always be looking we talked about this like you know the term is

1546
02:28:09.44 --> 02:28:14.80
opportunistic hiring most people are only hiring for an open position but if you've got talent

1547
02:28:14.80 --> 02:28:18.16
scouts out there they're bringing talent to you and saying you know what dispersions a difference

1548
02:28:18.16 --> 02:28:23.76
maker this isn't a player we have got to find a place in our organization so everybody when you have

1549
02:28:23.76 --> 02:28:28.96
a talent mindset it's not just you know from the CEO down all the way through that you've got

1550
02:28:28.96 --> 02:28:33.28
them mechanics and you're looking for top talent but it's all your employees once they're in the door

1551
02:28:34.24 --> 02:28:39.52
they're branding going hey you want to come try out here this is a tough place to work and and that's

1552
02:28:39.52 --> 02:28:44.88
exactly what happens in the special operations community there is no shortage of people signing up

1553
02:28:44.88 --> 02:28:50.40
to get a beating no shortage whatsoever and in an ideal world if you have a company with that

1554
02:28:50.40 --> 02:28:54.80
kind of mindset you'll have those people going you know what I got to work there because that that's

1555
02:28:54.80 --> 02:28:59.36
going to make me better either jockey you brought a point about when somebody leaves your organization

1556
02:28:59.36 --> 02:29:05.04
you show them respect and try to keep that relationship intact what we found great organizations

1557
02:29:05.04 --> 02:29:10.08
do even in the hiring process if they don't hire somebody is they spill still spend time to say

1558
02:29:10.08 --> 02:29:14.40
hey we love to debrief you on why we didn't select you for this position and they show them a

1559
02:29:14.40 --> 02:29:19.20
great deal of respect the special operations community does this when somebody drops from the

1560
02:29:19.20 --> 02:29:22.000
buds they do pull them aside and they have a conversation hey what do you want to do in the

1561
02:29:22.000 --> 02:29:26.80
Navy what have you learned from this process and they speak highly of the seals or the special forces

1562
02:29:27.60 --> 02:29:33.28
selection process when they leave we've seen organizations that are so highly respectful to people

1563
02:29:33.28 --> 02:29:39.52
that they don't even hire that at the end of the debrief they say wow no other organization has

1564
02:29:39.52 --> 02:29:43.92
done that for me they just simply do some don't even respond or some just say hey we didn't

1565
02:29:43.92 --> 02:29:49.52
select you next and they said it's not uncommon organizations that sort of follow this this tactic

1566
02:29:49.52 --> 02:29:53.44
it's part of their culture with the person looks at him and says do you have any other positions

1567
02:29:53.44 --> 02:29:59.28
available in that in the organization and literally make hires based off that by showing them such

1568
02:29:59.28 --> 02:30:05.04
a great experience during that hiring process it drives me nuts to have a bad process because

1569
02:30:05.04 --> 02:30:12.16
effectively and especially in today's era of social digital media that experience is your brand

1570
02:30:12.16 --> 02:30:17.60
going back out in the marketplace and you've created an impression you've created a customer

1571
02:30:17.60 --> 02:30:24.08
consumer or you've pushed one away if you didn't select them so it you know how you treat people

1572
02:30:24.08 --> 02:30:29.28
in the process it says everything about your company says everything about having a talent mindset

1573
02:30:29.28 --> 02:30:33.52
yeah and the bottom line with all these things that we're talking about all these behaviors is

1574
02:30:33.52 --> 02:30:38.96
you're you have a culture that people that are talented are gonna want to go to and that's what

1575
02:30:38.96 --> 02:30:44.16
this you know this section's about a sense of community the challenge the growth opportunities

1576
02:30:44.16 --> 02:30:49.20
having a purpose there salary and benefits given people ownership given people control over their

1577
02:30:49.20 --> 02:30:55.04
own destiny and that all those things you kind of sum up here with brand yourself as a talent

1578
02:30:55.04 --> 02:30:59.36
magnet the US military especially special operations has skillful marketing and branding which

1579
02:30:59.36 --> 02:31:04.08
is very weird for me to say but I know it's very true they're branding I mean let's face it the

1580
02:31:04.08 --> 02:31:10.000
Marine Corps is branding itself way before branding was a thing same with the army I mean I remember

1581
02:31:10.000 --> 02:31:16.48
I was totally brainwashed when I was a kid to be all you can be or the few the proberines like

1582
02:31:16.48 --> 02:31:24.72
that was just 100% just my whole branding in my mind is stuck to this day you know the few

1583
02:31:24.72 --> 02:31:31.04
the proberines Rangers lead the way that others may live day of press or lever lever how do you

1584
02:31:31.04 --> 02:31:36.32
say that can't we we can't say that they the press or lever is that right I think you got it right

1585
02:31:36.32 --> 02:31:43.68
yes sorry Tim Kennedy bro I'm sorry Tim Kennedy day a presso lever there you go to free the

1586
02:31:43.68 --> 02:31:50.72
oppressed the only easy day with yesterday and what you're doing with these things is is the other

1587
02:31:50.72 --> 02:31:57.20
the other big part of this is employee value proposition what you as an employee as employer

1588
02:31:57.76 --> 02:32:03.84
offer to your employees and you kind of you kind of lay out some you lay out one price waterhouse

1589
02:32:03.84 --> 02:32:12.24
coovers from empowering mentorships to customize coaching PWC provide you with the support you need

1590
02:32:12.24 --> 02:32:17.52
to help you develop your career you'll work with people from diverse backgrounds and industries

1591
02:32:17.52 --> 02:32:22.64
to solve important problems are you ready to grow here's the here's the Ranger one recognizing

1592
02:32:22.64 --> 02:32:27.68
that I volunteered as a Ranger fully knowing the hazards of my chosen profession I will always

1593
02:32:27.68 --> 02:32:33.12
endure to uphold the prestige honor and high a speed of core of the Rangers acknowledging the fact

1594
02:32:33.12 --> 02:32:39.36
that a Ranger is a more elite soldier who arrives at the cutting edge of battle by land sea or air

1595
02:32:39.36 --> 02:32:44.96
I accept the fact that as a Ranger my country expects me to move further faster and fight harder

1596
02:32:44.96 --> 02:32:52.80
than any other soldier Rangers lead the way branding I hate calling that stuff brand and because it's so

1597
02:32:52.80 --> 02:33:02.88
badass using social media to reach top talent all right let's hear it guys you guys

1598
02:33:02.88 --> 02:33:06.64
apparently you know you just talked about this what we talked about last night with so come

1599
02:33:06.64 --> 02:33:13.20
doing oh yeah so come and starting a podcast who did they reach out to they reach out to me but

1600
02:33:13.20 --> 02:33:16.96
yeah it's very cool what they're doing you know they've got a they they just wanted to you know get my kind

1601
02:33:16.96 --> 02:33:21.68
of cut on it and very cool what they're trying to do you know they're just trying to get the word out there

1602
02:33:21.68 --> 02:33:28.24
and and then you pointed out to me that whatever a year ago so come started an Instagram account

1603
02:33:28.24 --> 02:33:35.20
so we see our own special operations community building their social media presence so that they can

1604
02:33:36.000 --> 02:33:41.60
communicate with the next generation of special operations humans the military has been

1605
02:33:42.56 --> 02:33:48.96
pretty good about this so back in the late nineties or mid nineties ex games was

1606
02:33:49.52 --> 02:33:56.64
really coming to to to to to fruition and the military started creating their own extreme sports teams

1607
02:33:56.64 --> 02:34:01.28
because that's where they knew the new talent is that that's where that you know the demographic

1608
02:34:01.28 --> 02:34:07.92
of the 18 or I'm sorry let's say 15 year olds to the 25 year olds was was pushing towards that

1609
02:34:07.92 --> 02:34:16.56
time where do you think the military is going now for recruiting video games e-sports teams

1610
02:34:16.56 --> 02:34:20.48
they're putting e-sports teams together now if you asked our generation when they said hey we're

1611
02:34:20.48 --> 02:34:24.96
going to go recruit out of the e-sports or video game town pools we'd probably say

1612
02:34:24.96 --> 02:34:33.52
no way yeah that future seals and future marsawk you know Raiders and special forces are not

1613
02:34:33.52 --> 02:34:38.000
going to come out of this communities that's wrong that's that's where the new talent lays not all

1614
02:34:38.000 --> 02:34:44.88
that they're still town out there playing sports you know on teams wrestling but you know

1615
02:34:44.88 --> 02:34:49.36
that's just this new generation they play a lot of video games and that's where they're they're

1616
02:34:49.36 --> 02:34:56.40
finding success with their recruiting yeah I'm curious about that video games make me nervous

1617
02:34:56.40 --> 02:35:02.48
because people get addicted to them and yeah it's really it's a real thing it's a real thing

1618
02:35:02.48 --> 02:35:08.000
so let's be honest yeah it missed my generation my my dad was not big on video games in the

1619
02:35:08.000 --> 02:35:12.40
house we didn't have it that's why when I would go to my friends house I would stay up till four

1620
02:35:12.40 --> 02:35:17.12
while they were sleeping playing the video games Nintendo my guidance on punch out but what did

1621
02:35:17.12 --> 02:35:21.44
the guys usually do when we got back from operations oh bro I mean my first deployment to

1622
02:35:21.44 --> 02:35:26.64
Iraq they had Halo set up between tents and then they had this so seals I was already like

1623
02:35:27.28 --> 02:35:31.68
like you guys are playing video games what do you wait what is this what are you guys doing pack man

1624
02:35:31.68 --> 02:35:36.80
I mean I don't know I'm so out of it I'm from you know back then you were really

1625
02:35:36.80 --> 02:35:40.88
back so I'm thinking what is this so I like I went in there looked in so you see whatever

1626
02:35:40.88 --> 02:35:46.72
the guys are playing Halo and and I just didn't really get it and I thought it was just weird

1627
02:35:46.72 --> 02:35:51.52
couple you know five or six seals that were all into it but then they had a siege so different

1628
02:35:51.52 --> 02:35:57.12
tournament of Halo did you hear what I just said we're in Iraq we're on deployment we're fighting

1629
02:35:57.12 --> 02:36:04.88
the enemy and they have a at the command of joint special operations task force for Iraq

1630
02:36:05.76 --> 02:36:10.40
they have a Halo tournament so that's a little bit embarrassing so it's embarrassing that I got

1631
02:36:10.40 --> 02:36:15.44
seals doing it it's even more embarrassing that they have a siege so different and the height of

1632
02:36:15.44 --> 02:36:22.64
embarrassment was when my two players went up there for the tournament not only did they win

1633
02:36:22.64 --> 02:36:28.88
they utterly destroyed everyone and I guess in that game you you in the game Halo the version

1634
02:36:28.88 --> 02:36:35.60
that they were playing you have to get to 50 kills and in the finals these two guys in the finals

1635
02:36:35.60 --> 02:36:41.12
they killed the opponent 50 times and they got killed the ones and they came back and they were

1636
02:36:41.12 --> 02:36:47.84
super stoked and I just was I was like gentlemen I'm very disappointed what's really crazy is

1637
02:36:48.96 --> 02:36:53.36
just I mean great guys and one of them was a total freaking physical stuff the other one was

1638
02:36:53.36 --> 02:36:57.92
when I bad asked you know pipeting seals so they were awesome guys so I don't know maybe I'm

1639
02:36:57.92 --> 02:37:01.76
misjudged and it does make me nervous because people get addicted to those video games

1640
02:37:03.36 --> 02:37:08.16
yeah kind of for the same reason they get addicted to other stuff too though a lot of the time

1641
02:37:08.16 --> 02:37:13.36
because they don't have like other stuff going on necessarily but I don't know it's been kind of

1642
02:37:13.36 --> 02:37:19.28
proven to that video games are like a good method of problem solving like in your brain so people

1643
02:37:20.40 --> 02:37:25.60
it's true they can be conducive in certain circumstances why don't you say that you're

1644
02:37:25.60 --> 02:37:30.64
gonna do some problems solving all very there's that too but you get guys to play video games

1645
02:37:30.64 --> 02:37:35.04
and you just so you see what I'm saying I'm saying it can be it can have a little roll in there

1646
02:37:35.04 --> 02:37:39.52
I just have a little roll has you said have you been good at any video game ever in your whole life

1647
02:37:39.52 --> 02:37:45.44
you like Charlie I tried playing with these guys I would take two steps and die yeah you're talking

1648
02:37:45.44 --> 02:37:50.64
my halo that ones like okay that's that ones kind of advanced like you mentioned Mike Tyson punch show

1649
02:37:51.20 --> 02:37:54.72
yeah I never never admitted to that who meant Mike doesn't did you mention that yeah

1650
02:37:54.72 --> 02:38:00.64
well it's too bad a beat like Tyson punch show I beat Mike Tyson punch out and regular punch out you know

1651
02:38:00.64 --> 02:38:07.28
what the what the differences nothing really except one is the last guys Mike Tyson you know

1652
02:38:07.28 --> 02:38:14.40
brown guy and then on regular punch out the last guy's Mr. Dream same exact pixel formation of the guy

1653
02:38:14.40 --> 02:38:18.32
except he's a little lighter because that's when I think Mike Tyson ran into some problem

1654
02:38:19.76 --> 02:38:25.60
publicly I think with the law and whatnot you know but yeah I think they just had a

1655
02:38:25.60 --> 02:38:31.76
documentary come out on the evolution of video games for the reflex yeah

1656
02:38:31.76 --> 02:38:35.68
shit check but thank you for staying up for this generation yes sir yeah

1657
02:38:36.96 --> 02:38:42.80
all right moving back to the subject at hand it's I did this I have it not there everywhere

1658
02:38:42.80 --> 02:38:47.20
creating the hiring team creating the hiring team is one of the most important decisions

1659
02:38:47.20 --> 02:38:51.52
to make in the talent war but we see companies make the same form of stakes again and again

1660
02:38:51.52 --> 02:38:58.72
here they are B players or C players being put in charge of hiring you already kind of mentioned that

1661
02:38:59.52 --> 02:39:08.40
that's not a universal statement but it does happen the hiring team is homogeneous

1662
02:39:09.44 --> 02:39:15.60
homogeneous homogeneous homogeneous there we go thank you actual Charles tighten up

1663
02:39:15.60 --> 02:39:21.28
the English major over there the hiring team is homogeneous which means what we've got

1664
02:39:21.28 --> 02:39:26.24
a team here and they're all they're all all engineers the same people all engineers the all sales

1665
02:39:26.24 --> 02:39:30.32
people wanted to one together look or to put it in the context of special operations if you just

1666
02:39:30.32 --> 02:39:35.60
selected breachers to be the team of people selecting not not not not the point man

1667
02:39:35.60 --> 02:39:42.000
not the navigator yeah your breachers are going to look for future breachers number three there's

1668
02:39:42.000 --> 02:39:50.88
no training what's the training that you're talking about you know how to dig in and first of all

1669
02:39:50.88 --> 02:39:56.08
and you know i've got to say this is that every time you hire there are legal ramifications

1670
02:39:56.08 --> 02:40:00.80
i could tell you horror stories about asking the wrong questions

1671
02:40:03.44 --> 02:40:08.000
no it's great actually i had i literally had a senior hiring manager go in and there was a

1672
02:40:08.000 --> 02:40:14.16
lady they came in and one of his questions was is winner you do and i'm like really and yeah she

1673
02:40:14.16 --> 02:40:19.92
wasn't pregnant so that made that just she got an offer on the spot for me we saved the company a

1674
02:40:19.92 --> 02:40:23.84
couple million dollars and a lawsuit but the training you have to teach people to make sure that

1675
02:40:23.84 --> 02:40:28.64
you're asking questions that are simply job related and performance related number one but number two

1676
02:40:28.64 --> 02:40:34.08
how do you dig in and examine those questions how do you put that person under pressure how do you

1677
02:40:34.08 --> 02:40:40.000
pressure test them and train your hiring managers otherwise you get five guys on the engineering team

1678
02:40:40.000 --> 02:40:45.28
and to my example five breachers who are all asking questions about breaching you're asking engineers

1679
02:40:45.28 --> 02:40:50.24
and they're all asking sit different well how did you do this at this company they go to the next

1680
02:40:50.24 --> 02:40:55.84
person you get candidates to come out go well i answered same questions seven times and hopefully

1681
02:40:55.84 --> 02:41:01.68
i got a right six out of seven times but you need to train your interviewing team as to what

1682
02:41:01.68 --> 02:41:07.92
your success profile is and you know there are nine attributes but those you're not looking for

1683
02:41:07.92 --> 02:41:13.04
all nine maybe it's three maybe it's four maybe it's two for this specific role how are you going to

1684
02:41:13.04 --> 02:41:18.96
dig in on those and illicit responses that tell you are they a person of high drive are they a

1685
02:41:18.96 --> 02:41:24.88
person of high resiliency are they adaptable do they have team ability how are you digging in

1686
02:41:25.44 --> 02:41:29.60
and which characteristics you're looking for depend on what the success profile of that particular

1687
02:41:29.60 --> 02:41:34.16
role is and you have to train people to do that interviewing is not a skill that people just

1688
02:41:34.16 --> 02:41:40.24
out of thin air can do very very well it takes time to train and the more you train those people

1689
02:41:40.24 --> 02:41:45.60
the you know the more clear they become on selecting the best candidate that's in front of them

1690
02:41:46.24 --> 02:41:51.92
for that role so training them to that process what is the process that works for you

1691
02:41:51.92 --> 02:41:56.80
for this organization you're you're you're hiring team of a players needs to understand the process

1692
02:41:56.80 --> 02:42:01.12
and then they under they need to understand as it's just talking about is what are you looking

1693
02:42:01.12 --> 02:42:06.56
for during that process so Brian Decker with the SFAS they would continually go through training as they

1694
02:42:06.56 --> 02:42:11.76
came up with obstacles and identifying that hey the reason we're putting them through this specific

1695
02:42:11.76 --> 02:42:17.44
obstacle is we're looking for these two attributes and this is how you judge based off the score

1696
02:42:17.44 --> 02:42:23.04
card where they they they score on that attribute so that's the the training we're talking about

1697
02:42:23.04 --> 02:42:30.24
let let me say this one thing we say a players because a true a player has humility

1698
02:42:30.24 --> 02:42:36.72
the ability to look at a bunch of young seal candidates or a bunch of future employees and say

1699
02:42:37.68 --> 02:42:42.80
that macro right there she has the potential to be a lot better than I am and she's going to

1700
02:42:42.80 --> 02:42:46.40
make me she's going to raise my performance as well she's going to raise the bar and she's going to

1701
02:42:46.40 --> 02:42:51.44
challenge me a players can do that because they want competition they want healthy competition they

1702
02:42:51.44 --> 02:42:56.32
want to be surrounded by other a players you put B players your C players what we're saying there

1703
02:42:56.32 --> 02:43:00.88
is again because back to you know fear based hiring is I don't want to be outshined that that

1704
02:43:00.88 --> 02:43:06.48
Johnny Kim right there I will be a non-player in the organization if he's there we're not taking

1705
02:43:06.48 --> 02:43:11.36
them that's what that's what that's what what happens and so when you have ego and you have people

1706
02:43:11.36 --> 02:43:17.04
that are mediocre performers in charge of your hiring guess what you're going to get mediocre tell

1707
02:43:18.88 --> 02:43:23.60
the last mistake that people make is hiring as a secondary function

1708
02:43:23.60 --> 02:43:30.16
so we're not going to take jocca willing as a troop commander the task commander say hey

1709
02:43:30.16 --> 02:43:34.72
you got to train to go to war oh hey by the way you've got to cut over the buds every day at

1710
02:43:34.72 --> 02:43:41.36
three p.m. to assist with the assessment selection you can't do the phrase in the military two

1711
02:43:41.36 --> 02:43:46.000
things you need one thing well yeah we take in this this is hard to take one of our

1712
02:43:46.000 --> 02:43:51.76
times we take a players off the battlefield guys who want to continue going to war and we say hey

1713
02:43:51.76 --> 02:43:56.80
for the next two years actually you're going to have a greater impact on the community your soul job

1714
02:43:56.80 --> 02:44:00.32
your one thing it's an out of secondary function this is your primary function for the next two years

1715
02:44:00.32 --> 02:44:07.20
or six months is focusing on filling the talent and assessing the selected people in the

1716
02:44:07.20 --> 02:44:11.60
organization that's what it means by a secondary function and then you can score it and then you can

1717
02:44:11.60 --> 02:44:16.40
do a feedback loop if you've got the same people and I mean you'll have multiple teams across

1718
02:44:16.40 --> 02:44:22.24
multiple departments but once you've seen how they interview if if each one of those talented

1719
02:44:22.24 --> 02:44:27.84
candidates is going through the same group of people and getting the same structure you can go back

1720
02:44:27.84 --> 02:44:32.80
and evaluate the results you can get that feedback loop okay we hired this person how did they do

1721
02:44:34.16 --> 02:44:38.96
or we hired this person and they didn't do well what did we miss in the process and you're going

1722
02:44:38.96 --> 02:44:43.60
back to the same group of people is how to iterate a little bit better and you get a little bit

1723
02:44:43.60 --> 02:44:50.16
better each time but if you keep changing that team out you're effectively you have no standard

1724
02:44:50.16 --> 02:44:55.12
or you get the standard of the day with the team that you put together but if you get those a

1725
02:44:55.12 --> 02:45:02.88
players you make hiring the priority for what they do you train them properly you can look at how

1726
02:45:02.88 --> 02:45:07.60
we're doing and how do we exponentially increase what they're doing that's hard for a business

1727
02:45:07.60 --> 02:45:13.52
leader to sometimes very hard very very hard so what you tell me to do is take my best salesman

1728
02:45:13.52 --> 02:45:19.36
or saleswoman take them off the line for six months and have them focus on hiring the next

1729
02:45:19.36 --> 02:45:27.36
generation of sales leaders and our answer is yes in the short term a tactical mindset that may hurt

1730
02:45:28.40 --> 02:45:33.84
if you have a strategic mindset for the long term for the long run if he hires

1731
02:45:33.84 --> 02:45:40.32
three or four solid sales leaders that's going to have a much more exponential effect

1732
02:45:40.32 --> 02:45:45.12
and impact on the organization again that's hard to do it was hard for the sealed community

1733
02:45:45.12 --> 02:45:48.72
to take guys like you off the battlefield and say hey we need you to run training now

1734
02:45:48.72 --> 02:45:53.12
we know where you wanted to be and so again a lot of this is getting

1735
02:45:54.000 --> 02:45:58.16
that we say talent mindset getting business leaders just to make that mental paradigm shift

1736
02:45:58.16 --> 02:46:04.08
of how do that tactical mindset into a strategic mindset to play the long game and that's what

1737
02:46:04.08 --> 02:46:10.88
the talent war is it's the long game it's just that important it you know everything in your

1738
02:46:10.88 --> 02:46:15.92
environment your your product your service the economy the market the global conditions are

1739
02:46:15.92 --> 02:46:21.76
going to change and they're going to change rapidly but those nine attributes don't change

1740
02:46:21.76 --> 02:46:30.16
and they allow you to confront any circumstance as a business with confidence and a win

1741
02:46:30.88 --> 02:46:35.28
those things just won't change everything around you will change but those leadership principles

1742
02:46:35.28 --> 02:46:40.96
those nine character attributes those are the foundations and they will let you attack and win

1743
02:46:40.96 --> 02:46:45.12
in any given situation when you don't pay attention to them you're firefighting

1744
02:46:45.84 --> 02:46:50.08
covid comes along oh my god what do we do everybody's you know chicken little's and and it

1745
02:46:50.08 --> 02:46:55.12
becomes a very difficult problem to solve versus okay got it Roger that's today's situation

1746
02:46:55.52 --> 02:47:04.40
let's go next section here's characters revealed at one's limits and there's a subsection

1747
02:47:04.40 --> 02:47:10.80
called mic feels the pressure this is it Mike thought staring up the rope i'm going to fail out of

1748
02:47:10.80 --> 02:47:16.40
buds because of a freaking rope two weeks prior mic it completed hell week the instructors had

1749
02:47:16.40 --> 02:47:19.84
even pulled them aside and said you're one of the standout leaders in the class we know what

1750
02:47:19.84 --> 02:47:24.000
you can do as a leader so we need you to step aside so that we can test and evaluate other officers

1751
02:47:24.56 --> 02:47:29.68
yet now mic was struggling to climb a basic rope like he had been climbing since day one of the

1752
02:47:29.68 --> 02:47:34.64
Marine Corps he had been climbing ropes for years and he was good at it he'd never failed to get

1753
02:47:34.64 --> 02:47:40.96
up one until now for the first time in training mic was displaying serious signs of fatigue it was

1754
02:47:40.96 --> 02:47:47.20
an ideal moment to test him so the instructors dug in shouting up at him the other students who had

1755
02:47:47.20 --> 02:47:52.64
already completed the exercise watched from their nearby formation mic started up the rope again

1756
02:47:52.64 --> 02:47:58.24
he could sense all eyes on him he could feel the pressure he made it ten feet and dropped

1757
02:47:58.88 --> 02:48:06.000
the instructors kept yelling and mic started up the rope again and again and again mic was frustrated

1758
02:48:06.000 --> 02:48:10.80
he felt like a dirt bag for not being able to get up the rope but there was no way he was going to

1759
02:48:10.80 --> 02:48:16.56
quit he started up the rope again and fell again he got to his feet and prepared to start

1760
02:48:16.56 --> 02:48:21.44
up the rope again but the instructors stopped him and pulled him aside out of view from the other students

1761
02:48:22.16 --> 02:48:28.16
it's okay we all have these days one of the instructors said we wanted to apply some pressure to you

1762
02:48:28.16 --> 02:48:35.12
to see how you would react and whether you would quit the instructors didn't really care whether mic

1763
02:48:35.12 --> 02:48:44.56
made it to the top of the rope or not good little test see where it's at that that day and again

1764
02:48:44.56 --> 02:48:49.04
I'd been in the Marine Corps for what five years at this point climb plenty of ropes was going to

1765
02:48:49.04 --> 02:48:56.16
climb the ropes I remember that day just something with the body was off I had zero energy and

1766
02:48:56.16 --> 02:49:05.44
you talk about feeling like the eyes were on me it was almost near tears not not from the pressure

1767
02:49:05.44 --> 02:49:13.28
but I would just spent all that together I was I was done and I mean it just reinforces the point

1768
02:49:13.28 --> 02:49:19.52
that you know you say character cannot be created where none exists and you truly don't know people

1769
02:49:20.24 --> 02:49:25.52
until you push them to the limits that's not just physical limits that's also mental limits

1770
02:49:25.52 --> 02:49:30.16
and that's the point of the special operations assessment and selection it's not because we're

1771
02:49:30.16 --> 02:49:36.08
sadistic maybe we are a little but it's not to put these young men and women through

1772
02:49:36.08 --> 02:49:42.16
you know paying for our benefit there's a purpose behind it much like an interview process

1773
02:49:42.72 --> 02:49:47.68
is we know that once we can push them to the threshold that's our moment okay now we're going to see

1774
02:49:48.40 --> 02:49:52.32
if this individual has what it takes if they have the right attributes one of the things in

1775
02:49:52.32 --> 02:49:57.84
you go back to the attributes one of one of our colleagues Jason Tuchen you know you talked about

1776
02:49:57.84 --> 02:50:02.88
resiliency the whole point of a lot of you know the special operations assessment selection is to see

1777
02:50:02.88 --> 02:50:07.84
how resilient people are he talked about in buds attracts much like the other special operations

1778
02:50:07.84 --> 02:50:14.48
some pretty phenomenal human beings like NCAA athletes and Olympic athletes and when he ran

1779
02:50:14.48 --> 02:50:20.48
first phase he saw a lot of these you know what people consider exceptional athletes quit

1780
02:50:21.44 --> 02:50:26.08
and he said they were low on resiliency because this was the first time they had failed

1781
02:50:26.88 --> 02:50:30.64
in their life and that's a point in the training as he says just to keep knocking people down

1782
02:50:30.64 --> 02:50:36.40
to see how they react and when you have a high achiever who's never really experienced failure

1783
02:50:36.40 --> 02:50:43.52
and they repeatedly fail in buds or these other assessment programs sometimes they quit

1784
02:50:43.52 --> 02:50:50.000
and that's what you're looking for but somebody who's experienced nothing but obstacles in their

1785
02:50:50.000 --> 02:50:55.68
life is well is more prepared for what they face in special operations and more equipped to deal

1786
02:50:55.68 --> 02:51:01.04
with crisis than some of these exceptional athletes who just never really face challenge.

1787
02:51:02.88 --> 02:51:08.24
Yeah you're gonna fail some stuff they're gonna make sure you fail some stuff 100% like you're not

1788
02:51:08.24 --> 02:51:12.000
going to pass everything not care who you are they're going to make you sure you fail some stuff

1789
02:51:12.000 --> 02:51:18.16
to make sure that when you do fail something you don't lose the bubble you talk a little bit about

1790
02:51:18.16 --> 02:51:25.52
the interview process and you go into the interview process here and here's a strategy on

1791
02:51:25.52 --> 02:51:30.72
on you go a bunch of stuff I'm gonna skip to one part for guidance on strategy look to special

1792
02:51:30.72 --> 02:51:36.56
operations murder boards murder boards are not quite as terrifying as they sound they are full

1793
02:51:36.56 --> 02:51:42.64
of pressure but professionally run and operators sits on one side of the table and on the other side

1794
02:51:42.88 --> 02:51:49.04
is a psychologist and five to eight senior enlisted and officers representing the entire community

1795
02:51:49.04 --> 02:51:54.000
the psychologist has previously assessed the operator to identify potential red flags

1796
02:51:54.000 --> 02:51:59.12
the senior panel then digs in raising the pressure by probing the red flags and presenting

1797
02:51:59.12 --> 02:52:04.64
complex scenarios they ask difficult questions and push against sore spots to see how the

1798
02:52:04.64 --> 02:52:10.56
operator reacts if you approach your interviews a little more like a soft murder board you can

1799
02:52:10.56 --> 02:52:17.12
reveal valuable information to that end we have five tips number one know what you're looking for

1800
02:52:17.12 --> 02:52:24.48
with each question number two create a core set of questions to be used with each candidate number three

1801
02:52:24.48 --> 02:52:31.84
ask scenario based and behavioral questions number four add challenges number five push candidates

1802
02:52:31.84 --> 02:52:40.08
outside their comfort zone gotta be careful on the legal side of this huh George you did you do

1803
02:52:41.44 --> 02:52:45.68
and and that's where you know that training comes in that we talked about earlier you people

1804
02:52:45.68 --> 02:52:52.16
have to understand you know hiring decisions there's a lot of law around it and so you want to

1805
02:52:52.16 --> 02:52:56.88
train those people effectively but you can create an enormous amount of pressure on somebody by

1806
02:52:56.88 --> 02:53:01.52
asking them difficult questions and you know it's funny when we're when when we're teaching

1807
02:53:01.52 --> 02:53:07.52
veteran candidates do you the number one candidate or the number one question that stumps people

1808
02:53:07.52 --> 02:53:12.16
executives and military people alike I'll just ask a simple question tell me about your leadership

1809
02:53:12.16 --> 02:53:17.60
style and people think from muscle memory they have muscle memory they oh I should be able to answer

1810
02:53:17.60 --> 02:53:21.92
this and they go on and on and on and on and on I get that with the exact I get that with veterans

1811
02:53:21.92 --> 02:53:27.60
but push people to to describe themselves put them in uncomfortable situations talk about failures

1812
02:53:27.60 --> 02:53:33.04
tell me about a time that you failed and there's several executives that if you can't talk about

1813
02:53:33.04 --> 02:53:39.36
how you failed and failed miserably and got back up and what you learned from it that's a person

1814
02:53:39.36 --> 02:53:44.16
you need to avoid but yeah there's there's a lot of law around it but if you know what you're looking

1815
02:53:44.16 --> 02:53:48.96
for with each question you plan your questions you plan your inner you know your interviewing

1816
02:53:48.96 --> 02:53:53.60
panel your murder board you can create a lot of pressure but mind you there's a balance too

1817
02:53:53.60 --> 02:53:58.000
because you you don't want to make it like the military version of it because candidates go okay

1818
02:53:58.000 --> 02:54:02.72
I'm not working there but there's you can carve a simple balance where they know they're

1819
02:54:02.72 --> 02:54:07.28
going to be tested in your environment and those people that know they're going to be tested in

1820
02:54:07.28 --> 02:54:11.92
your environment the right people are going to be drawn to your environment because of that test

1821
02:54:12.64 --> 02:54:17.52
any any person who's of talent that's worth their salt that comes to an easy interview process

1822
02:54:17.52 --> 02:54:21.68
and rocks it in the back of their head when they walk out the doors are going okay that was a little

1823
02:54:21.68 --> 02:54:26.72
bit easy and so now they're starting to think about okay that's that was a little too easy

1824
02:54:26.72 --> 02:54:31.28
but a person with true talent that wants to be challenged it wants to be valued and you know

1825
02:54:31.28 --> 02:54:36.40
working in an environment where there's the grind in the drive that tough process they're going to

1826
02:54:36.40 --> 02:54:42.000
go okay I'm ready for this bring it let's go let's do this and you find out a lot by putting

1827
02:54:42.000 --> 02:54:47.28
people under pressure in that scenario and let's dispel the notion that you know we call it a murder

1828
02:54:47.28 --> 02:54:51.52
board and you've you've been on them people aren't y'all in edge yeah and I'm just out of that

1829
02:54:51.52 --> 02:54:56.32
and and they're looking if you've given the answer they whether they like it or not they're

1830
02:54:56.32 --> 02:55:00.88
they're going to dig a little in a very professional manner and and some murder boards go

1831
02:55:00.88 --> 02:55:05.20
quickly because they identify that this person's humble and they're admitting you know past mistakes

1832
02:55:05.20 --> 02:55:09.20
and that they learn from it and that they're they're still working progress and improving

1833
02:55:09.20 --> 02:55:13.68
and there's murder boards go quickly it's the others where somebody comes in they're overly confident

1834
02:55:13.68 --> 02:55:18.56
they're arrogant and so that's where people that are trained to assess those behaviors and this

1835
02:55:18.56 --> 02:55:24.64
is one big behavioral interview this is the military's version of a behavioral interview those go

1836
02:55:24.64 --> 02:55:31.20
very long and it it almost becomes like a confessional they just they just keep digging themselves

1837
02:55:31.20 --> 02:55:36.08
now another tactic to that is after you put the person through a murder board it's like one

1838
02:55:36.08 --> 02:55:40.08
person goes out and say hey what how'd you feel about that process what what do you think you

1839
02:55:40.08 --> 02:55:45.92
can do better what areas didn't you expand upon to see now if they can do a what do we call

1840
02:55:45.92 --> 02:55:49.20
a brutally honest self assessment like hey you know what man I wish I could do that again

1841
02:55:50.48 --> 02:55:54.32
I missed this this I didn't reinforce this point and so if that person's training they come back in

1842
02:55:54.32 --> 02:56:01.84
and say hey real real self reflective after action that they just gave and one of the reasons

1843
02:56:01.84 --> 02:56:06.40
that we put this specific technique in there is because most interviews and companies are done

1844
02:56:06.40 --> 02:56:13.84
on a one-to-one basis and Jocco echo I bet I you could I could put you in one of these murder

1845
02:56:13.84 --> 02:56:18.56
boards and you could watch three other people ask questions and they'll have their opinions

1846
02:56:18.56 --> 02:56:27.28
but just in the observation mode that is of tremendous value just to watch people how they answer

1847
02:56:27.28 --> 02:56:33.68
how they act how they think how they reasoned through a particular scenario how they explain

1848
02:56:33.68 --> 02:56:39.68
their problem solving methodology so so many interviews due to the firefighting and the time and you

1849
02:56:39.68 --> 02:56:43.92
know that this is reactionary they don't put the time into it they don't put people in a room and go

1850
02:56:43.92 --> 02:56:49.92
okay this was my impression of the answer to the question this is how I think they'll work or

1851
02:56:49.92 --> 02:56:55.04
succeed or fail or struggle in this particular environment you can get actually a lot out of

1852
02:56:55.04 --> 02:57:00.96
observation which is why we put this in the book to give an example of what are on those murder

1853
02:57:00.96 --> 02:57:04.80
boards and you probably remember this one is they're they're gonna ask you an ethical question

1854
02:57:04.80 --> 02:57:11.04
you're dealing with a boss who does something highly unethical you know what actions do you take

1855
02:57:11.04 --> 02:57:18.08
and the response is going to tell you a lot about the person yeah yeah and you guys do a great

1856
02:57:18.08 --> 02:57:23.04
job of kind of laying all the stuff out from how to observe them to do a role plays with them

1857
02:57:23.04 --> 02:57:30.56
sent case case studies and scenarios you've got all that stuff in here observation what to look for

1858
02:57:30.56 --> 02:57:35.60
how to look for it different situations you can look for it and I mean it's just it's just a very

1859
02:57:35.60 --> 02:57:42.96
thorough chapter and then you get into assessment tests and you talk about you know the IQ test

1860
02:57:42.96 --> 02:57:54.32
at the army used and just the different assessment tests that get used now so that's all good

1861
02:57:54.32 --> 02:57:57.52
and one of those tests you comment on here one company we work with that yeah

1862
02:57:57.52 --> 02:58:02.24
if Overwatch using aptitude motivation and personality assessment to weed out candidates are

1863
02:58:02.24 --> 02:58:06.64
veterans despite being high performers we're all scoring very low on the test and thus being

1864
02:58:06.64 --> 02:58:13.60
eliminated from the hiring process curious might took the test for himself his score just 57% of

1865
02:58:13.60 --> 02:58:21.52
failing grade so what was up with that test so your assessment test naturally had bias

1866
02:58:23.04 --> 02:58:28.72
built in by whoever designed that test and there was a bias against you know I'm not saying in the

1867
02:58:28.72 --> 02:58:34.40
native light veterans are very different from the demographic that test was based around

1868
02:58:35.12 --> 02:58:39.04
the bottom line we're trying to say here's the assessments are good it's another layer to the

1869
02:58:39.04 --> 02:58:43.84
process that you use to select people especially if you have talent profiles and when you do these

1870
02:58:43.84 --> 02:58:48.56
talent profiles to identify your high performers you also want to do that against your low performers

1871
02:58:48.56 --> 02:58:53.92
to see if the assessment test is actually accurate because if your high performers know performers

1872
02:58:53.92 --> 02:59:00.000
in the same role or generally getting the same results that got a assessment test is most likely

1873
02:59:00.000 --> 02:59:07.76
not relevant or added value to that process is it yeah is it measuring what you want it to measure

1874
02:59:07.76 --> 02:59:14.80
right is it determining the success factors and one of the challenges with companies is that and

1875
02:59:14.80 --> 02:59:20.000
this is just you know kind of that that inside the talent acquisition function and talent management

1876
02:59:20.000 --> 02:59:25.52
function people will buy and enterprise wide solution and apply that test across the board

1877
02:59:26.08 --> 02:59:30.64
and just say okay this test applies to everybody and in my particular case it's screening

1878
02:59:30.64 --> 02:59:37.44
out veterans and we're able to look at that and go every yes something's wrong but it's hard to

1879
02:59:37.44 --> 02:59:43.68
persuade people that you know something they've invested a good amount of money in is not showing

1880
02:59:43.68 --> 02:59:48.64
them what it should show them I mean they're very wedded to their solution they're they're bought

1881
02:59:48.64 --> 02:59:54.08
in and it's hard to move them off the mark but Mike was an exceptional example of where people are

1882
02:59:54.08 --> 03:00:01.28
using something that's not showing success factors that you want it to be showing you it's another

1883
03:00:01.28 --> 03:00:07.60
data point yeah which so we do see companies that use these personality assessments as a

1884
03:00:07.60 --> 03:00:15.04
either no go or go criteria and I would caution people not to do that you talked about not being

1885
03:00:15.04 --> 03:00:21.60
a rules follower funny enough we had a company that recently assessed one of our people and you know

1886
03:00:21.60 --> 03:00:27.04
I won't say what's physical organization this person works for but he's with a very unique

1887
03:00:27.04 --> 03:00:32.40
or organization and he's been in that seat for five years which is an indicator that this guy is

1888
03:00:32.40 --> 03:00:37.60
is a high performing individual ethical absolutely and when he took this test the company came back

1889
03:00:37.60 --> 03:00:42.16
and said this guy's not you know it shows that he doesn't follow rules and we sort of had to

1890
03:00:42.16 --> 03:00:47.60
explain the context of the role he was in and say he finds a way to win and that may be why

1891
03:00:48.32 --> 03:00:52.72
he's not testing well in that one criteria on that assessment so you've got to be cautious even

1892
03:00:52.72 --> 03:00:57.28
like Josh cotton Dr. Cotton that does this for a living what will caution you

1893
03:00:58.40 --> 03:01:02.16
with regards to results on assessments he said you got to take it with a grain of salt

1894
03:01:02.16 --> 03:01:08.08
and some people to use a phrase that that you know I remember hearing it muster actually

1895
03:01:08.08 --> 03:01:14.56
assessment tests are not inoculations they don't insulate you from making a bad hire they don't

1896
03:01:14.56 --> 03:01:20.64
inoculate you from you know all the risk in the world you need to use them as my says they're

1897
03:01:20.64 --> 03:01:26.56
just one more data point but they it all begins and ends with knowing what success looks like

1898
03:01:26.56 --> 03:01:32.56
for a particular role and that requires thought it requires you know planning and and mapping that

1899
03:01:32.56 --> 03:01:39.76
out how you're going to go do it like I said you got that chapter locked in the next chapter

1900
03:01:40.56 --> 03:01:47.20
goes into the fact that you can't hire or fire your way to success talent acquisition is only

1901
03:01:47.20 --> 03:01:52.24
one part of a two variable equation for success talent plus leadership equals victory

1902
03:01:53.52 --> 03:02:00.64
and then there's a story in here about Mike and a little task unit that you were in called task unit

1903
03:02:00.64 --> 03:02:06.88
Charlie and what's interesting about task unit Charlie so task unit bruiser and task unit Charlie

1904
03:02:06.88 --> 03:02:12.80
and task unit alpha we're all at seal team three and every one of those task units had

1905
03:02:13.52 --> 03:02:18.08
some great guys and you know if you put the bell curve on all of them they'd all be

1906
03:02:18.08 --> 03:02:23.36
relatively the same group of you know seals you know couple low guys couple high guys

1907
03:02:23.36 --> 03:02:28.000
bunch of guys in the middle just just kind of typical nothing good or bad just typical

1908
03:02:28.000 --> 03:02:34.08
but it didn't really work out that way from a leadership perspective no it did not so pulled

1909
03:02:34.08 --> 03:02:38.88
from the same talent pull away like you said the talent profile for both the task units was the

1910
03:02:38.88 --> 03:02:45.12
exact same and this is where you know we caution people in the you know this is why we end

1911
03:02:45.12 --> 03:02:51.92
the book with this chapter is you had two groups where the resources the talent everything was

1912
03:02:51.92 --> 03:03:00.48
predominantly the same same budgets same weapon systems same people really and one rise raised to

1913
03:03:00.48 --> 03:03:08.32
the occasion and one fell below the standard in the seal teams and was toxic and the final determination

1914
03:03:08.32 --> 03:03:17.52
was leadership so bad leadership can poison any talent pull of exceptional people it just can't

1915
03:03:17.52 --> 03:03:28.24
and in that I'm so fortunate I got to observe that at a young tenure in my career and what I

1916
03:03:28.24 --> 03:03:34.24
benefited to is you know I got plucked out of that task unit but you're task unit and it talks

1917
03:03:34.24 --> 03:03:38.64
about how I wasn't the root of the problem but the person that was the root of the problem

1918
03:03:38.64 --> 03:03:44.64
I basically threatened because I have an allergic reaction to people that are just selfish

1919
03:03:44.64 --> 03:03:49.44
and all about themselves and this individual wasn't he he wasn't to solely blame but he was the

1920
03:03:49.44 --> 03:03:56.08
impetus of the the problem and so I came I guess with warnings when they sent me over to you and

1921
03:03:56.64 --> 03:04:00.88
then all the sudden I started prosper and I've become your operations officer I was your assistant

1922
03:04:00.88 --> 03:04:06.16
operations officer you put me in charge of operations officer you that was a motive and then you promoted

1923
03:04:06.16 --> 03:04:11.92
me two months later to Delta between a.o.i.c. you know the funny thing is a lot of the guys the

1924
03:04:11.92 --> 03:04:18.40
deployment after that were sestone took basically task unit bruiser back to Iraq we ended up in the

1925
03:04:18.40 --> 03:04:25.04
battle of southern city a majority of the guys in that troop were from task unit Charlie so again

1926
03:04:25.04 --> 03:04:30.24
you put them under a great litter and they did exceptional things so that's why we say you can no longer

1927
03:04:30.24 --> 03:04:34.72
well you know you can't fire or hire fire your way to success ultimately you have to lead and you

1928
03:04:34.72 --> 03:04:39.76
have to develop your people and that's what this chapter is about yeah we we kind of brought it around

1929
03:04:39.76 --> 03:04:45.20
to you know as we mentioned earlier in the book you have to treat your human capital as importantly

1930
03:04:45.84 --> 03:04:52.08
or as important as your financial capital and this was a way to kind of close that out to say

1931
03:04:52.08 --> 03:04:57.60
the journey doesn't end when you hire a players you get this whole process right that's not the

1932
03:04:57.60 --> 03:05:02.72
end of it you're not done and we did this ill video clip and we call it the talent war

1933
03:05:02.72 --> 03:05:09.20
the interesting thing about this title is and and we went into this in the video is that war doesn't end

1934
03:05:10.000 --> 03:05:14.88
it's continuous you're gonna win some battles but there's no point in this even if you read this

1935
03:05:14.88 --> 03:05:19.84
book if you do everything in this book and Mike and I are working with you and everything goes perfectly

1936
03:05:19.84 --> 03:05:26.24
you don't get to declare victory people grow people change products change the environment changes

1937
03:05:26.24 --> 03:05:34.08
people move on you have to keep after this this is a discipline that you need to bring to your company

1938
03:05:34.08 --> 03:05:39.68
and when you do you will have a competitive advantage it's the path it's part of the path

1939
03:05:41.84 --> 03:05:46.48
back to the book far too often a company will hire talented candidate a talented candidate who's

1940
03:05:46.48 --> 03:05:50.88
performance ends up being lackluster the company chalks up to a bad hire fires the person

1941
03:05:50.88 --> 03:05:56.96
starts all over again a costly assumption there are many reasons someone might not be performing as you expect

1942
03:05:57.52 --> 03:06:02.96
and only one of them is a bad hire chances are if a talented individual is not performing to standard

1943
03:06:02.96 --> 03:06:13.36
it's not their fault it's yours a little extreme ownership coming at you live

1944
03:06:13.36 --> 03:06:20.72
public talent work talent development you guys talk about training mentoring and coaching

1945
03:06:22.64 --> 03:06:28.80
good quote and hear from Jonah Pinto from 711 CEO most important thing in any organization is leadership

1946
03:06:29.20 --> 03:06:32.56
it's always leadership first because leaders find a way to get things done

1947
03:06:34.80 --> 03:06:41.76
once again something up a great attitude and and for the listeners to open to is actually a

1948
03:06:41.76 --> 03:06:46.80
west point the military academy graduate he served as a army officer before he entered the

1949
03:06:46.80 --> 03:06:52.80
the corporate world leadership is the most critical determinant of achieving victory for business

1950
03:06:52.80 --> 03:06:56.72
leaders are the ones who drive change makes things happen so when working to transform high

1951
03:06:56.72 --> 03:07:02.32
potential high potentials into high performers it's critical to identify and develop future

1952
03:07:02.32 --> 03:07:12.32
leaders that's just the way it's got to be and then wrapping this up a little bit here

1953
03:07:13.92 --> 03:07:18.88
actually this I'll wrap this up right here with this like it's not quite the closer but it's close

1954
03:07:19.84 --> 03:07:23.28
a true talent mindset like I said this is kind of the underlying thread of the book

1955
03:07:23.28 --> 03:07:27.76
remember the most critical step in winning the war on talent is developing the talent mindset

1956
03:07:27.76 --> 03:07:32.32
the deep belief that human capital is the single most important competitive advantage your company

1957
03:07:32.32 --> 03:07:37.04
can have if you truly believe human capital is your greatest competitive advantage you won't

1958
03:07:37.04 --> 03:07:42.32
stop with a hiring process you will continue to invest in and develop your people creating an

1959
03:07:42.32 --> 03:07:48.56
unbroken chain of excellence that's what good leaders do that's how great organizations are formed

1960
03:07:49.36 --> 03:07:53.68
the training and leadership development opportunities you provide your employees reveal the

1961
03:07:53.68 --> 03:08:00.000
truth of your talent mindset you might be able to attract candidates with a talk of a talent mindset

1962
03:08:00.000 --> 03:08:06.24
but if you want them to stay you need to show your employees that you truly value talent

1963
03:08:06.24 --> 03:08:13.52
by helping them to grow into their potential starts with you if you demonstrate exemplary leadership

1964
03:08:13.52 --> 03:08:20.000
others will follow practice a talent mindset mentoring coach your key leaders put in the time and

1965
03:08:20.000 --> 03:08:26.08
effort to develop your people into something great and a great organization will emerge

1966
03:08:29.84 --> 03:08:38.32
so that's I mean then you you go on you have a good closing but you know that's it it's

1967
03:08:38.32 --> 03:08:42.88
recruiting selecting training mentorship putting the right people in the right places

1968
03:08:42.88 --> 03:08:49.60
think about that's what putting the right people in the right places all those things

1969
03:08:50.72 --> 03:08:56.64
are really one thing and that is leadership and this is how you build a team and leaders have

1970
03:08:56.64 --> 03:09:03.04
to understand the importance of that they have to understand the importance of building the correct team

1971
03:09:04.16 --> 03:09:10.56
so one thing that we're doing you know is obviously helping people build these teams with EFO

1972
03:09:10.56 --> 03:09:19.52
overwatch tell me a little bit about the process at EFO for watch to take and find the right people

1973
03:09:19.52 --> 03:09:27.12
bring them in and get them assigned to the right companies out there these and you know a lot of

1974
03:09:27.12 --> 03:09:31.28
people say hey you guys are veteran recruiting for I sort of actually push back I say no we are

1975
03:09:31.28 --> 03:09:37.04
our leadership talent acquisition firm we we only deal with military leaders and people naturally

1976
03:09:37.04 --> 03:09:42.24
put a rank on that oh senior enlisted or or officers you know it's all levels in the military

1977
03:09:42.24 --> 03:09:49.84
as long as they have the attributes we're looking for especially humility so the military leaders

1978
03:09:49.84 --> 03:09:54.96
come coming out of the military you have already been highly vetted and guess what they have

1979
03:09:54.96 --> 03:10:00.88
rep mutations and it's very easy for us to reach back into those communities and reach into the

1980
03:10:00.88 --> 03:10:05.28
seals and say hey does anyone know this chakra willing guy yeah I want your buds with them

1981
03:10:05.28 --> 03:10:10.88
solid another guy says I did two platoons with them you can not find a more reliable team or

1982
03:10:10.88 --> 03:10:16.16
any any individual and that's what we need to hear we are also putting them through multiple assessments

1983
03:10:16.16 --> 03:10:21.92
Josh's EPI we're going to start utilizing that as a basis for us plus we want to collect data

1984
03:10:21.92 --> 03:10:27.12
to see if we can start identifying the difference between high performers middle performers in

1985
03:10:27.12 --> 03:10:34.72
low performers and he's already started that that process and then really with with the candidate side

1986
03:10:34.72 --> 03:10:40.88
it's so simple it's very easy to identify the ones that are just you've got it and we're really

1987
03:10:40.88 --> 03:10:46.32
looking for the top 10 20% of every community in the military and those that don't fall into that

1988
03:10:46.32 --> 03:10:51.36
realm we still want to help them with training we're dedicated to our brothers and sisters in

1989
03:10:51.36 --> 03:10:56.08
our arms to make sure that they're they're successful we can't place every candidate you know

1990
03:10:56.08 --> 03:11:00.72
we just don't have enough job opportunities one day we will but if one thing for the military

1991
03:11:00.72 --> 03:11:05.44
leaders that come to us they go through some of the best training but they go through the extreme

1992
03:11:05.44 --> 03:11:09.52
ownership and what what we and we talked about this last night the reason I love extreme ownership

1993
03:11:09.52 --> 03:11:15.12
is I've never seen two people you in life create a leadership system that is so simple because

1994
03:11:15.12 --> 03:11:19.60
if you go ask the Air Force army the Navy the Marine Corps they're all they're all going to give

1995
03:11:19.60 --> 03:11:26.16
you different answers on what attributes are important and what are the the primary principles

1996
03:11:26.16 --> 03:11:31.04
of leadership they're all saying the same thing but it's not codified so what extreme ownership and

1997
03:11:31.04 --> 03:11:35.84
even for the candidates reading the book is what we tell them is hey in the interview process you

1998
03:11:35.84 --> 03:11:40.08
have to tell story why we love extreme ownership so much is not only is it going to help you

1999
03:11:40.08 --> 03:11:45.28
contextualize your leadership experience and that's what they need help with some of these leaders

2000
03:11:45.28 --> 03:11:50.56
coming out special operations leaders who have been serving for 20 years leading is muscle memory

2001
03:11:50.56 --> 03:11:54.80
to them now and that's why if you ask them the question tells about your leadership style some

2002
03:11:54.80 --> 03:11:59.60
struggle through it but when we teach them the context of extreme ownership they start to

2003
03:11:59.60 --> 03:12:05.68
get their story and the way you guys wrote the book combat story principle business context

2004
03:12:05.68 --> 03:12:10.32
helps them to translate we all know the number one challenge for veterans trying to get jobs is

2005
03:12:10.32 --> 03:12:14.80
translating their experience extreme ownership sets them on the path to doing that in a good

2006
03:12:14.80 --> 03:12:20.96
manner then I handle that first part of them they get George and Carly Walden and

2007
03:12:20.96 --> 03:12:26.56
they put them through search training they prepare them for the interview process the feedback

2008
03:12:26.56 --> 03:12:31.84
we're getting from senior special operations leaders to other military leaders is this is the

2009
03:12:31.84 --> 03:12:38.80
best advice I've ever gotten from taps and all these other programs that we go through we don't

2010
03:12:38.80 --> 03:12:43.52
sugarcoat anything we give them the reality of the situation and we're very straightforward that

2011
03:12:44.16 --> 03:12:49.92
it's on you we can't step into the interview with you it is on you to convey your value to the

2012
03:12:49.92 --> 03:12:55.60
organization and get them to say yes they want to say yes that's the military leader side

2013
03:12:56.24 --> 03:13:04.08
and talk about rewarding work not only do we do we we we make a you know a good paycheck from from

2014
03:13:04.08 --> 03:13:08.96
this mine of work it's also the emotional return on investment from senior in our former

2015
03:13:08.96 --> 03:13:13.92
brothers and sisters step into senior management positions and then crush it that's feedback we get

2016
03:13:13.92 --> 03:13:22.48
from business leaders best higher I've I've ever made on the the client side we screen our clients

2017
03:13:22.48 --> 03:13:27.04
is diligently as we screen our candidates and this has been a learning process we've had to learn

2018
03:13:27.04 --> 03:13:32.64
this through scars and it comes down to I need the clients to commit and I need to hear that they

2019
03:13:32.64 --> 03:13:38.72
have a foundation of belief that leadership is wildly and infinitely more important than in

2020
03:13:38.72 --> 03:13:43.76
street experience if we hear that from the clients we believe they truly understand that then that's a

2021
03:13:43.76 --> 03:13:48.56
client we're most likely going to work with but if we get a client we've had this like hey listen

2022
03:13:48.56 --> 03:13:52.16
I need a leader right now to step into this role I don't want to have to train them I don't want

2023
03:13:52.16 --> 03:13:55.60
to have to build a relationship with them literally said this I just need them to do their job

2024
03:13:56.16 --> 03:14:00.24
and it was a lucrative role we said hey we're not the best fit because we know that that

2025
03:14:00.24 --> 03:14:04.64
relationship is just going to end poorly so also clients come to us and they say we need to

2026
03:14:04.64 --> 03:14:09.20
fill in 20 days they've already compromised the process and we're not going to do that so we're very

2027
03:14:09.20 --> 03:14:17.76
prideful on the white love service that we provide and if we don't have many misses at all but if we

2028
03:14:17.76 --> 03:14:23.36
find out a candidate it didn't work it is like a get punch it is like our reputation has been

2029
03:14:24.000 --> 03:14:29.60
marked and that we take it very seriously and I think that's what you know sort of

2030
03:14:29.60 --> 03:14:36.40
differentiates us from from a lot of the executive search firms out there is I know we together

2031
03:14:36.40 --> 03:14:40.56
in George we're going to build this into the number one leadership town acquisition firm in the

2032
03:14:40.56 --> 03:14:45.12
nation I have no doubt then when people look for directors of leadership in training as well as

2033
03:14:45.12 --> 03:14:49.28
chief leadership officers they're going to say go to you if overwatch because the men and women

2034
03:14:49.28 --> 03:14:54.64
were placing know how to train people they know how to create the foundation for strong

2035
03:14:54.64 --> 03:14:58.64
cultures and that's really where we're making the name right now we'll still place people in the

2036
03:14:58.64 --> 03:15:03.84
COO roles general management roles but one of my passions for you if overwatch is that that

2037
03:15:03.84 --> 03:15:12.24
director of leadership in training or the COO position yeah you know just to be completely

2038
03:15:12.24 --> 03:15:16.56
transparent to be in talent acquisition you have to have a pretty strong mass acoustic gene

2039
03:15:16.56 --> 03:15:23.76
about you because it's a brutal a brutal job function but I've been helping veterans for over 20

2040
03:15:23.76 --> 03:15:29.60
years and where it started was I want to be able to give to our brothers and sisters and arms of

2041
03:15:29.60 --> 03:15:33.44
things that I didn't have when I transitioned out in the 90s and what they didn't have was

2042
03:15:33.44 --> 03:15:39.60
actionable information and we deal once we go through selection kind of assessment and finding

2043
03:15:39.60 --> 03:15:44.72
that right candidate with all those attributes they're still this bridge between the ideal

2044
03:15:44.72 --> 03:15:49.20
opportunity for that veteran leader for that senior leader and that position it's called the

2045
03:15:49.20 --> 03:15:55.84
interview and that is very very difficult for veterans to cross that divide to be able to articulate

2046
03:15:55.84 --> 03:16:01.68
clearly and then a crisp professional impactful manner in the interview that you're going to be able

2047
03:16:01.68 --> 03:16:08.32
to over deliver in that particular role so it isn't just you know we're doing all facets of it and

2048
03:16:08.32 --> 03:16:14.88
I think that's what makes the dynamic between me and Mike and our team so well so good so solid and so

2049
03:16:14.88 --> 03:16:20.48
different is that you have 20 years of selection and assessment we both been in leadership roles I've

2050
03:16:20.48 --> 03:16:26.32
been in the executive roles and we're bringing actionable information to top military leaders

2051
03:16:26.32 --> 03:16:32.24
so that they are ready for that transition into corporate America and when you put that person

2052
03:16:32.24 --> 03:16:38.32
in that position it gets more veteran hiring and so we have to get it right with the company

2053
03:16:38.32 --> 03:16:42.72
we have to get it right with the veteran and and there's some veterans that we we're not going

2054
03:16:42.72 --> 03:16:50.000
to place but we're absolutely agnostic if they come to us we're going to help but crossing that bridge

2055
03:16:50.000 --> 03:16:55.36
screening our our candidates screening our clients we are very meticulous about how we go about

2056
03:16:55.36 --> 03:17:03.20
doing that yeah I think talking to some of the clients of people that we've placed and just

2057
03:17:03.20 --> 03:17:08.48
awesome to hear everything that you guys are talking about it's like it's like with extreme

2058
03:17:08.48 --> 03:17:11.36
ownership we go and work with the company and we check back in with them three months later and

2059
03:17:11.36 --> 03:17:15.36
they're like oh yeah this is working this is awesome and it's the same thing we're getting back

2060
03:17:15.36 --> 03:17:20.24
you know when I hear from clients you know this is the best hire we've had oh yeah we we were worried

2061
03:17:21.12 --> 03:17:29.36
and now we're promoting I think it's just like a totally it as we often say it works this stuff works

2062
03:17:29.36 --> 03:17:34.16
and you take these individuals and I know Mike you and I've been talking about this and I know it's a

2063
03:17:34.16 --> 03:17:39.68
little bit hard to do but we're some of the guys that we've placed we're going to get them on the podcast

2064
03:17:39.68 --> 03:17:44.08
so they can talk about not just their military experience but then what it was like going through

2065
03:17:44.08 --> 03:17:47.84
we if Overwatch and now what it's like entering this civilian world you know we're letting them get

2066
03:17:47.84 --> 03:17:53.12
settled in a little bit before we get them back to fly out to California and do this but I think

2067
03:17:53.12 --> 03:17:56.24
it'll be awesome for people to start to hear those stories and get that feedback

2068
03:18:00.24 --> 03:18:06.16
when people want to engage you if Overwatch towards the process so they can go to the website

2069
03:18:06.16 --> 03:18:11.92
efoverwatch.com another thing we we do with companies is we are here as a talent advisory

2070
03:18:11.92 --> 03:18:18.40
we can come in and basically set the foundation based off the playbook we've provided so you have

2071
03:18:18.40 --> 03:18:24.48
a hiring process from which to grow and that's probably the greatest service we can provide

2072
03:18:24.48 --> 03:18:29.60
beyond just finding the right leaders for your organization that's critical there's a lot of

2073
03:18:29.60 --> 03:18:33.76
times a George will actually have to ask the client do you have interview questions what

2074
03:18:33.76 --> 03:18:38.24
your process can I send you something to help you make the selection of the leaders we present

2075
03:18:38.24 --> 03:18:46.64
and that's more often than that that talent advisory piece is is key but but if I'm just

2076
03:18:47.84 --> 03:18:54.56
company out there that wants to hire so I go to efoverwatch.com I fill out the various information

2077
03:18:55.20 --> 03:18:59.60
and then we're going to set up a call and you're going to talk with Mike he'll talk to

2078
03:18:59.60 --> 03:19:06.48
myself you may talk with one other person and we're going to really kind of dig in with you as to

2079
03:19:06.48 --> 03:19:10.48
okay let's talk about your company what is your position in the market what are you trying to

2080
03:19:10.48 --> 03:19:14.40
accomplish where are you trying to grow what are your leadership gaps what are your individual

2081
03:19:14.40 --> 03:19:19.12
contributor gaps you know we want to know both of those things you know what are those things that

2082
03:19:19.12 --> 03:19:25.20
are keeping you up at night and then let's talk about how talent and leadership solves those problems

2083
03:19:25.20 --> 03:19:30.72
and are you committed to leadership is the most important thing in your business and you know we'll

2084
03:19:30.72 --> 03:19:35.36
also walk through to find out the maturity of their hiring process and how they've done it because

2085
03:19:35.36 --> 03:19:39.68
you know we we want to make sure that they know how to do because they're mechanics behind this

2086
03:19:39.68 --> 03:19:44.48
as well we've helped with offer letters I've helped with compensation you know structuring complex

2087
03:19:44.48 --> 03:19:48.88
offers which which is not easy for small and medium business to do a lot of times they just don't

2088
03:19:48.88 --> 03:19:54.80
have that expertise so we will sit down and spend a good hour hour and a half with them you know

2089
03:19:54.80 --> 03:20:00.000
diagnosing you know why did they come to us what is it that they need what can we solve for them

2090
03:20:00.000 --> 03:20:04.56
and should we be working together and I'm sorry miss I'm sorry so the the question jocca

2091
03:20:04.56 --> 03:20:08.08
absolutely it's going to be a series of phone calls we want to know everything about your business

2092
03:20:08.08 --> 03:20:12.88
about your industry and a lot of times the reason we do these phone calls because what business

2093
03:20:12.88 --> 03:20:17.84
the leaders think they want is not necessarily what they need and our our job as well during

2094
03:20:17.84 --> 03:20:22.80
that is to advise them based off what we're hearing what we think you really need is x, y, z,

2095
03:20:22.80 --> 03:20:27.52
not a, b, c and our clients have followed our advice and it's worked out beautifully

2096
03:20:27.52 --> 03:20:31.84
what you know we're in that advice is coming from nothing but scars and failures especially

2097
03:20:31.84 --> 03:20:38.56
with 20 years of talent acquisition between him and uh currently so we we want a very very strong

2098
03:20:38.56 --> 03:20:43.28
relationship with our clients if they sign the contract beyond that then it gets into the talent

2099
03:20:43.28 --> 03:20:49.68
sink for what what what a talent sink is for us is we're going to spec out what that position is

2100
03:20:49.68 --> 03:20:55.36
and what are the attributes they're truly looking for from there we we tell him hey we're going to

2101
03:20:55.36 --> 03:21:01.76
need usually two to three weeks to start screaming and assessing potential leaders the the people

2102
03:21:01.76 --> 03:21:06.56
the the right leaders for this position it could be through our organic town pool we're also

2103
03:21:06.56 --> 03:21:11.20
going to run an external search for people we haven't touched yet that maybe out there that may be a

2104
03:21:11.20 --> 03:21:17.04
good fit for that role and that takes time and our clients again we're preaching patience

2105
03:21:17.84 --> 03:21:27.20
we have a pretty darn good fill speed rate to fill and if people allow us to go through our process

2106
03:21:27.20 --> 03:21:32.88
it usually very statistically it works out and they're very good pairing yeah well it's

2107
03:21:32.88 --> 03:21:37.52
like what we do methodical and you know we saw say all the time at S. L. Front what we do is we

2108
03:21:37.52 --> 03:21:43.12
solve problems through leadership and what better way to solve a problem through leadership than to

2109
03:21:43.12 --> 03:21:48.88
actually give a person give a give a company a leader that understands these principles that knows

2110
03:21:48.88 --> 03:21:53.92
how to lead that knows how to step in and make things happen so that's been awesome you have

2111
03:21:53.92 --> 03:22:00.72
over watch dot com I can't we've been going for almost three and a half hours but I real quick

2112
03:22:00.72 --> 03:22:06.96
you have battlefield we just kind of ran our first pilot program and to tell us about that a little bit

2113
03:22:06.96 --> 03:22:13.20
so this besides let me interject that was freaking awesome you weren't a believer first is that

2114
03:22:13.20 --> 03:22:18.16
accurate or that's completely inaccurate I don't know where where why do you think that we

2115
03:22:18.16 --> 03:22:21.92
late when I thought we're like oh juckers not necessarily believe we're he has to see the concept

2116
03:22:21.92 --> 03:22:28.72
personally I 100% of a believer that was a thousand percent I mean you know if you think about what

2117
03:22:28.72 --> 03:22:35.68
I do in this podcast I take I take battlefield strolls through books so for me to go out and walk

2118
03:22:35.68 --> 03:22:41.44
battlefields is to me I would do nothing but that that would be my whole life if I was telling

2119
03:22:41.44 --> 03:22:48.24
you I I got offered a show in Europe to like go and walk battlefields and talk the stories and I just

2120
03:22:48.24 --> 03:22:54.48
couldn't do it it was multiple months of filming and I just it's not happening you know I just can't do it

2121
03:22:55.52 --> 03:23:02.32
but at some point in my life I wouldn't be surprised so yeah I don't know where that idea came from

2122
03:23:02.32 --> 03:23:08.72
that is a data-centric lack of relationship with no-one or boss yeah it's actually kind of crazy to think that

2123
03:23:08.72 --> 03:23:17.76
me that me even with my whole life would not want to go out and walk on bat sacred hollowed

2124
03:23:17.76 --> 03:23:23.36
battlefields and talk about leadership that's yeah so I'm 100% on board and I always have been from

2125
03:23:23.36 --> 03:23:31.68
day one so so where this came from is in 2012 no yeah 2012 with one of my seal squadrons

2126
03:23:31.68 --> 03:23:35.60
the commanding officer especially the timing was not good we were one month away from going to

2127
03:23:35.60 --> 03:23:41.12
Afghanistan and and I'm the operations officer and of course you know the task list of what you

2128
03:23:41.12 --> 03:23:46.48
need to get done before you deploy is pretty deep as an operations officer and I I sort of tried

2129
03:23:46.48 --> 03:23:51.76
to reason with him I hate timing is not good any heard me out and he said my guess what what we're

2130
03:23:51.76 --> 03:23:56.40
going out there leadership development is not optional it's mandatory and so we went out to

2131
03:23:56.40 --> 03:24:02.72
get his bird and of course I'm pouty you know I'm doing my quiet sort of pouty I'm there and as we

2132
03:24:02.72 --> 03:24:08.72
started to walk the different stands the two day walk of get his bird you started to realize that

2133
03:24:08.72 --> 03:24:14.32
the commanders both Confederate Union forces faced the same dilemmas same human dilemmas and

2134
03:24:14.32 --> 03:24:19.36
human problems that we faced in Afghanistan I rack another regions of the world what makes and we

2135
03:24:19.36 --> 03:24:24.72
call this in the military we call these staff rights it is a technique we utilize to develop our

2136
03:24:24.72 --> 03:24:31.12
people again looking at past examples of commanders humans that made both great decisions and bad

2137
03:24:31.12 --> 03:24:36.24
decisions in learning from their mistakes and their successes to make you a better leader

2138
03:24:37.12 --> 03:24:41.76
when you walk and people may say well you know the civil wars drastically different than I

2139
03:24:41.76 --> 03:24:50.16
rack or Afghanistan technology no the problems they face transcend geography they transcend technology

2140
03:24:50.16 --> 03:24:55.04
they transcend time and this is why a lot of businesses do these staff rights we call it you

2141
03:24:55.04 --> 03:25:01.04
have battlefield but what I think we do better than any just sort of history and that takes people out there

2142
03:25:01.04 --> 03:25:06.72
is we tie extreme ownership into it and on this first one the pilot we brought 20 of our clients out

2143
03:25:06.72 --> 03:25:10.16
and I don't know about you I mean they probably don't call you because they don't have your phone number

2144
03:25:10.16 --> 03:25:15.84
but I've been getting text messages from CE the CEOs that route there that this was one of the

2145
03:25:15.84 --> 03:25:20.08
most valuable leadership development trips they've ever taken or you could see it on their face

2146
03:25:20.08 --> 03:25:24.48
this is in the first hour you could see it on their faces they're looking they're taking notes they're

2147
03:25:24.48 --> 03:25:32.56
talking to each other yeah it was just extremely impactful and you know it was a pilot and we're

2148
03:25:32.56 --> 03:25:38.56
going to start spinning those things up yeah if you will keep you posted we'll keep you posted

2149
03:25:38.56 --> 03:25:42.16
and I mean there's going to be limited seats I mean that's just the way it is it's going to be

2150
03:25:42.16 --> 03:25:49.92
small groups but who knows it's freaking it's just an unbelievable way to learn and an unbelievable

2151
03:25:49.92 --> 03:25:57.20
way to develop and an unbelievable way to increase your understanding not just of history not just

2152
03:25:57.20 --> 03:26:04.64
of leadership but of human nature to go out there and see what has happened in our past so it's

2153
03:26:04.64 --> 03:26:13.20
freaking awesome a lot of stuff going on man we do so the book comes out when November 10th so it's

2158
03:26:37.68 --> 03:26:45.60
George any any closing comments here you know this is it's been an interesting journey to

2159
03:26:45.60 --> 03:26:51.76
write this book and it's it's it's very serendipitous to find somebody who has the same passion

2160
03:26:51.76 --> 03:26:58.64
for talent that I have and and so you know I hope that Mike and I got the best out of each other in this

2161
03:26:58.64 --> 03:27:07.04
book push each other and really proud of what we've delivered here because ultimately it's about

2162
03:27:07.04 --> 03:27:13.28
helping companies just get better and win and and and I'd like to think we did a pretty good job of

2163
03:27:13.28 --> 03:27:20.08
of giving them a good roadmap the talent is the most critical thing that you can focus on

2164
03:27:21.36 --> 03:27:27.84
any closing thoughts Mike no check we're trying to get better we're trying to build a better team

2165
03:27:29.60 --> 03:27:35.36
echo Charles this any recommendations on how we can get better interesting thing about

2166
03:27:35.36 --> 03:27:42.32
what we've been talking about is like yeah you guys talk about you know these are things

2167
03:27:43.36 --> 03:27:48.96
to to look for you know and as far as hiring and stuff but on the other side of the coin like if

2168
03:27:48.96 --> 03:27:54.88
you're looking at get hired hired it's like a good information resource to be like okay that's

2169
03:27:54.88 --> 03:28:01.28
what I'm gonna strive for you know very interesting anyway it's for striving for stuff

2170
03:28:01.28 --> 03:28:12.64
stop about Jaco feel for striving really transition well yeah so Jaco feel how should I say

2171
03:28:12.64 --> 03:28:20.64
assortment supplementation items the ones that stay on my mind which I noticed like I don't

2172
03:28:20.64 --> 03:28:27.76
so much think that much about milk really yeah that's interesting you must be not not wanting to

2173
03:28:27.76 --> 03:28:33.84
bit be stronger well here's the things not that I don't take milk all the time I don't think about

2174
03:28:33.84 --> 03:28:39.60
it all the time but I do think about joint warfare krill oil and vitamin D for some reason I

2175
03:28:39.60 --> 03:28:44.16
don't know why I feel like because it's like an everyday maintenance thing and when I stop

2176
03:28:44.16 --> 03:28:50.88
taking it that's when I pay the price harsh here's my question to you yes do you know what that

2177
03:28:50.88 --> 03:28:56.88
price is like have you felt it because you don't really go after it or I don't I don't go off

2178
03:28:56.88 --> 03:29:03.92
it yeah so I don't know the price yeah I do yeah so basically like you know like okay all right

2179
03:29:04.32 --> 03:29:08.64
let me turn my attention over here so you know like sometimes like you okay maybe you're feeling

2180
03:29:08.64 --> 03:29:15.44
weak or whatever right but as far as your joint skill you can feel strong but your joints are like

2181
03:29:15.44 --> 03:29:20.32
jammed up that's almost in a way worse than being weak because if you're weak you're like oh

2182
03:29:20.32 --> 03:29:24.96
maybe any eat good maybe whatever but if you're joint it's like it's a it's a different issue

2183
03:29:24.96 --> 03:29:31.28
seems saying is a good news get back on the joint warfare get back on the krill oil you just

2184
03:29:31.28 --> 03:29:36.24
feel all that stuff just flying back into your joints then you're back in the game then we start

2185
03:29:36.24 --> 03:29:42.64
feeling good about it real good by the way so and I know this too because I have gone off it

2186
03:29:42.64 --> 03:29:48.88
and gotten on few times and yeah so I know the price and I know the benefit do you are you able

2187
03:29:48.88 --> 03:29:57.44
to make these assessments because you're a doctor no okay well my my explanation of the joint

2188
03:29:57.44 --> 03:30:03.04
warfare in krill oil flying back into your joints was we'll say a little bit short of a medical

2189
03:30:03.04 --> 03:30:11.52
explanation as far as how I'm not a doctor either yes I know that but I've done also of a very

2190
03:30:11.52 --> 03:30:19.52
intense medical assessment of of vitamin B3 and cold war and here's the assessment

2191
03:30:20.80 --> 03:30:25.52
I've traveled all over the place I've shaken hands with a bunch of people I have not had this

2192
03:30:26.48 --> 03:30:33.60
disease called COVID for some reason could that reason be right okay that reason be

2193
03:30:34.32 --> 03:30:40.80
because I'm on the D3 and the cold war no I'm not saying it is because I'm not a doctor

2194
03:30:40.80 --> 03:30:46.56
no but you know you know there's there is such thing as coincidence then there's such thing as

2195
03:30:46.56 --> 03:30:51.52
correlation and then there's such thing as causation you seem saying the three levels

2196
03:30:52.72 --> 03:30:58.56
hey that's it we'll leave it at that how about that cool safe right yeah just saying we're talking

2197
03:30:58.56 --> 03:31:03.12
earlier about you can only ask certain questions in the interview or not so much you can only ask

2198
03:31:03.12 --> 03:31:09.20
you can't ask certain questions that's very correct actually to deviate from the the

2199
03:31:09.20 --> 03:31:15.04
Jockel field thing for a second isn't it a lot of the times the case where the interviewer

2200
03:31:15.52 --> 03:31:21.36
is kind of in a way like wanting to bond with a person just on a maybe on just a small level like

2201
03:31:21.36 --> 03:31:27.44
hey oh wins the baby do yeah and it's like oh I jam that up like I really like you know it's like it's

2202
03:31:27.44 --> 03:31:32.72
not like they're trying to like enforce powers something like this no I mean the best

2203
03:31:32.72 --> 03:31:36.24
interviewers are always trying to build a relationship because one of the critical things you

2204
03:31:36.24 --> 03:31:39.68
want to get out of people is authenticity yeah that's one of the biggest things and the best

2205
03:31:39.68 --> 03:31:44.96
way you do that is by building a relationship and to your point that person may come in they may

2206
03:31:44.96 --> 03:31:50.08
not come into your company so yeah they do and most of those things are done with malice they

2207
03:31:50.08 --> 03:31:57.28
have an accidentally but you know in today's litigious society even accidental scary that will get

2208
03:31:57.28 --> 03:32:02.32
yeah and see that's why it's so like yeah like scary for real scary because it's like man

2209
03:32:02.32 --> 03:32:08.80
it's one thing to be like hey that was a dick move for me to do that so I'm not going to do that

2210
03:32:08.80 --> 03:32:12.88
anymore you know well how about I just not be a dick in the interview oh problem solved right

2211
03:32:12.88 --> 03:32:17.28
here's the thing problem's not solved because you're getting sued yeah because I can be well in that

2212
03:32:17.28 --> 03:32:22.16
case yes but as far as from a learning perspective or from just a general functioning perspective

2213
03:32:22.16 --> 03:32:25.36
now I'm be like how about that so I'm gonna be real nice how about that I'm gonna bond with this guy

2214
03:32:25.36 --> 03:32:29.12
mean what you're like you know lying what you call minefield landline field one of those

2215
03:32:29.12 --> 03:32:34.88
you're walking on eggshells and whatnot yeah which kind of isn't a very good bonding approach yeah

2216
03:32:34.88 --> 03:32:39.76
you're walking on eggshells yeah then you you kind of get you know your seaming personal your

2217
03:32:39.76 --> 03:32:46.16
risk of vests you know so you know as we teach veterans any good interview is simply a

2218
03:32:46.16 --> 03:32:52.16
conversation it's ultimately what it comes down to and you know when we work with veterans it's just

2219
03:32:52.16 --> 03:32:58.24
hey man be yourself be authentic you know but put it in a vernacular of extreme ownership and talk

2220
03:32:58.24 --> 03:33:04.08
about how great of a leader you are just have a conversation and that's it's simple not easy

2221
03:33:04.08 --> 03:33:10.24
and I love that phrase late later to laws are not always a good thing not all of them are great

2222
03:33:10.24 --> 03:33:16.56
and that's a profession in itself yeah yeah it's just part of my profession is you know that

2223
03:33:16.56 --> 03:33:21.28
training you know ultimately training keeps people safe right that's what it does yeah that's one of

2224
03:33:21.28 --> 03:33:24.80
those situations where you can be mad about it you might not like a particular law but it's

2225
03:33:24.80 --> 03:33:30.000
the law and you got to you got to just deal with it that's just the way it is so you never know

2226
03:33:30.000 --> 03:33:35.12
people could be made it can claims like medical claims about things about supplements and you could

2227
03:33:35.12 --> 03:33:41.04
run into all kinds of legal problems you which he just did there but hey if you're waging war on

2228
03:33:41.04 --> 03:33:49.04
colds various sickness illnesses viruses etc you don't know to name any is there a metal

2229
03:33:49.04 --> 03:33:55.28
quote is that a medical claim real easy maybe not unless these are the things that you do want

2230
03:33:55.28 --> 03:34:01.92
to follow so what's that called like a caveat or no it's not a caveat is it caveat yeah like

2231
03:34:01.92 --> 03:34:12.64
a dislike yeah just here's my disclaimer I'm not a doctor yeah so don't listen to me yes

2232
03:34:12.64 --> 03:34:18.96
well or just listen you know yeah how about this listen to joc what about that okay we'll go with it

2233
03:34:18.96 --> 03:34:23.52
we'll stick with that the mind that I'm not a doctor yeah Johnny Kim doctor

2234
03:34:23.52 --> 03:34:30.000
joc go on no doctor keep these all these things in mind no last yeah vitamin vitamin D daily

2235
03:34:30.000 --> 03:34:35.20
daily man these are things that you know again to stay on your mind I'm not saying don't keep

2236
03:34:35.20 --> 03:34:44.88
milk on your mind I'm not saying that I'm saying me personally in my experience D3 joint warfare

2237
03:34:44.88 --> 03:34:51.12
or not whatever these are the things that okay we have these two-pronged effect let me move my

2238
03:34:51.12 --> 03:34:55.92
attention over here to my pros so you have long term you have short term right and every once

2239
03:34:55.92 --> 03:35:00.56
a while you'll get a golden nugget that's both that's what milk is seem saying a lot of these

2240
03:35:00.56 --> 03:35:06.32
health foods they don't have the immediate gratification as heavy as a lot of these unhealthy

2241
03:35:06.32 --> 03:35:11.44
things I see them saying I do sure milk is one of those rare golden nuggets the other one is

2242
03:35:11.44 --> 03:35:19.60
sushi my opinion but back to milk it's dessert in the form of health food or protein health food

2243
03:35:19.60 --> 03:35:25.52
in the form of a dessert boom either way you're good there you go either way it's true also discipline

2244
03:35:25.52 --> 03:35:31.76
multiple forms multiple forms there's your intrinsic discipline that you go through life with that

2245
03:35:31.76 --> 03:35:35.52
comes from within you know they're not talking about that one right I'm talking about this

2246
03:35:35.52 --> 03:35:42.64
implementation so yes okay what is it what is the three forms you got the powder that's a good one

2247
03:35:42.64 --> 03:35:47.60
that's a good pre workout one I like this first pre workout like I dig a like a pre life

2248
03:35:48.16 --> 03:35:52.48
yeah by the way it was so hot this weekend out here with you have your intensive soap I know

2249
03:35:52.48 --> 03:35:59.68
it's hot there but I mixed up the jockel pomer in the big iced tea like pitcher with ice in it

2250
03:36:01.04 --> 03:36:06.08
cooked those are you out yeah you go feel

2251
03:36:10.08 --> 03:36:15.44
also the the cans okay here's what the cans are really really

2252
03:36:15.44 --> 03:36:26.16
it's a health brain health drink right so it doesn't sound glamorous right think of it it's a

2253
03:36:26.16 --> 03:36:35.52
brain and body health drink okay in the form of a delicious refreshing beverage

2254
03:36:36.16 --> 03:36:40.000
beverage you want to say different times I was gonna say energy drink but then then you got all the

2255
03:36:40.000 --> 03:36:43.68
what you call the what you call it when you have a reputation a word has a reputation

2256
03:36:43.68 --> 03:36:50.32
a freaking stigma has a stigma you seem saying anyway that's what it is so the can is also

2257
03:36:50.32 --> 03:36:54.32
this window okay look we don't want to drink the can we don't want to mix up powders okay I get it

2258
03:36:54.32 --> 03:37:01.44
pop up pill that even has a stigma nonetheless this one's a good way of popping good pills capsules

2259
03:37:01.44 --> 03:37:06.000
technically you know all these forms depending on your lifestyle depending on what you're doing

2260
03:37:06.000 --> 03:37:11.28
that day they can you know at least one's gonna work for you I think my experience that's how it is

2261
03:37:11.28 --> 03:37:15.20
also we got work your kid milk we got chocolate tea and all the stuff is available at the

2262
03:37:15.20 --> 03:37:21.12
vitamin shop we also got if you're gonna get into jjitsu which you might you probably should

2263
03:37:21.84 --> 03:37:29.44
good origin main dot com get yourself a geek get yourself a rash card get yourself things that you

2264
03:37:29.44 --> 03:37:34.48

2265
03:37:34.48 --> 03:37:38.32
we're not always training jjitsu sometimes you have to have other parts of your life that's why

2266
03:37:38.32 --> 03:37:43.60
we make jeans that's why we make boots that's why we make t-shirts whatever a bunch of different

2267

2271
03:38:11.44 --> 03:38:16.08
in one person's opinion and I think it's an what he call it an objective

03:38:17.92 --> 03:38:24.80
all right we'll go anyway jocco store dot com go there if you appreciate the developments

2276
03:38:44.88 --> 03:38:50.000
wear to represent while you're on this path that we're on this path that's not easy by the way I don't

2277
03:38:50.000 --> 03:38:58.08
know if you guys know this or not my can George it's hard it's full of pitfalls temptation traps

2278
03:38:58.08 --> 03:39:02.96
wise men once told me that unless when you're on the path you want to represent jocco store dot

2279
03:39:02.96 --> 03:39:07.92
com and that hoodies shirts hats beanie's shorts board shorts

2280
03:39:10.64 --> 03:39:14.56
at some point the shirts are these week the here's the thing they're not up okay

2281
03:39:15.20 --> 03:39:19.92
but they will prove that they're quite hard and they're not the best it's a process you know

2282
03:39:19.92 --> 03:39:24.48
well what it would it would it would it would make say Mike said something the methodology it's a process

2283
03:39:24.48 --> 03:39:31.68
of all the process trust the process is one of our things anyway quite that okay

2284
03:39:31.68 --> 03:39:36.64
quick to create that into the whole deal and boom you got it anyway yes joccal store the three

2285
03:39:36.64 --> 03:39:42.80
if you want something also we got a podcast record subscribe to this podcast because

2286
03:39:43.52 --> 03:39:49.44
echo thinks that you're not going to we also have joccal unraveling which has been on this

2287
03:39:49.44 --> 03:39:54.64
feed it's going to soon be on its own feed joccal unraveling podcasts it's myself a darelecoop

2288
03:39:54.64 --> 03:40:00.40
but that was the thread we had to change the name because I was getting sued again which is always

2289
03:40:00.40 --> 03:40:05.84
fun so that's why it's called joccal unraveling because I own my own name jocco so I can pretty

2290
03:40:05.84 --> 03:40:10.000
much put that on anything and no one can bother me about it grounded podcast we haven't done

2291
03:40:10.000 --> 03:40:14.48
the while maybe record one more this week we have an opportunity warrior kid podcasts as well

2292
03:40:14.48 --> 03:40:18.32
for those little kids out there and if you got little kids or even if you're a grown human

2293
03:40:18.32 --> 03:40:25.92
and I need some soap go to irishokranch.com where young aiden the warrior kid is making soap

2294
03:40:25.92 --> 03:40:31.04
there's a no one out one or the warrior kids still you made warrior kid so like actual

2295
03:40:31.68 --> 03:40:41.68
so not just you as an adult but also your children you too we have a youtube channel

2296
03:40:41.68 --> 03:40:47.12
where echo makes videos and if it's a form in a video he puts a bunch of explosions in it

2297
03:40:47.12 --> 03:40:51.60
and if it's a for our video then it's just nothing because that's the way he operates

2298
03:40:51.60 --> 03:40:58.72
different purposes videos yeah it's cool all right okay we're we're talking about

2299
03:40:58.72 --> 03:41:08.48
effective hiring processes leadership right Mike Shirley George should we put explosions

2300
03:41:08.48 --> 03:41:15.92
smoke and fire in this video occasionally in this in this video that we do that we're doing

2301
03:41:15.92 --> 03:41:20.64
right so it's making at some point when you're talking about something it would it not be

2302
03:41:21.52 --> 03:41:29.20
a good thing to have maybe a black off helicopter fly overhead or a minigun open up

2303
03:41:29.20 --> 03:41:34.08
or an explosion happened in the background echo I'm gonna back you up on this you know you

2304
03:41:34.08 --> 03:41:40.000
ask anyone on the ear for watch team and say what don't I do they say we don't do cute so

2305
03:41:40.000 --> 03:41:45.44
I'm not talking cute bro I'm talking minigun I'd be over the top I think you're hitting

2306
03:41:45.44 --> 03:41:51.12
down the right I think you're right but here's the thing and this is for real if I'm like hey

2307
03:41:51.12 --> 03:41:58.24
if I get moved inspired and I got my notes here I don't have my note here also you're you're

2308
03:41:58.24 --> 03:42:03.68
starting to take it under consideration no I'm saying I'm explaining I have my notes here

2309
03:42:03.68 --> 03:42:08.000
and maybe I was moved by something George or Mike said right I have my note to be like okay look

2310
03:42:08.000 --> 03:42:13.60
if I could isolate what they said and try my best to capture the feeling that I got when you said

2311
03:42:13.60 --> 03:42:19.52
it maybe put my can cut that up into a little video that might involve explosions the

2312
03:42:19.52 --> 03:42:28.16
effects me too much like a certain financial uh tv host mad money oh yeah this is get

2313
03:42:28.16 --> 03:42:39.04
a lot of the money yeah yeah yeah good good comparison I think it's my opinion anyway yes

2314
03:42:39.04 --> 03:42:44.48
some videos have explosions a shorter ones whatever and the video version of this podcast

2315
03:42:44.48 --> 03:42:50.000
but we're keeping it wrong I don't even add color and you want me to add a mini gun opening

2316
03:42:50.000 --> 03:42:56.24
up I don't know probably not I don't know though I could be wrong anyway also psychological

2317
03:42:56.24 --> 03:43:02.56
warfare if you didn't know what that is that's an album that joker recorded with tracks each track

2318
03:43:02.56 --> 03:43:09.28
has a purpose and it gets you past these moments a weakness on this path that we're on in the

2319
03:43:09.28 --> 03:43:13.44
event of you being on the path which of course we all are in the last hundred percent effective
