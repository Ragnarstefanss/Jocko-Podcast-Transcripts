[00:00:00] This is Jockel Podcast number 256 with Echo Charles and me, Jockel willing.
[00:00:07] Good evening, Echo. Good evening. And joining us once again is Dave Burke,
[00:00:12] Good evening, Dave. Good evening. And tonight we are going to rap the final installment
[00:00:19] on guidelines for the leader and commander by General Bruce Clark. This is the subject of podcast's
[00:00:26] plural 251 252 253 254 255 and now find me 256 so much to learn taking the lessons that were
[00:00:35] passed on to Colonel David Hackworth who served the career of Vietnam wrote the book about face
[00:00:41] taught me many leadership lessons well he learned those lessons from this book written by General Bruce Clark
[00:00:48] who served in Korea World War II World War I who led many soldiers trained even more
[00:00:57] including one that he didn't even know about me. And we are trying to pass those lessons on.
[00:01:06] So for the final installment let's get back to the book guidelines for the leader and commander
[00:01:14] chapter 11 physical conditioning there you go Echo Charles. I'm sure your interest just got peaked.
[00:01:23] Here we go. I would like to pass on to you for such implementation as maybe practical
[00:01:28] within your several commands and within your various types of headquarters and units some
[00:01:32] thoughts on the problem of physical exercise, physical condition and physical training.
[00:01:36] This is a complex subject. It success depends on the program. Each commander works out
[00:01:42] to fit his needs and facilities and then enthusiastically and energetically pushes. While many
[00:01:49] of our units and individuals are in fine physical shape this is not universally true in many commands.
[00:01:56] I believe it can be made more nearly universally true by a more general concept as to its importance
[00:02:03] and to a consideration of the implementation of practical steps that can be taken in this field
[00:02:08] without materially interfering with our other activities. What greater you giving general
[00:02:15] Clark for simplicity on that whole opening? I'm not getting them a good grade. Luckily he redeemed
[00:02:20] your energy he redeemed himself in the end of this book with some real simple clear concise.
[00:02:26] So he thinks that you know the simple statement is people should be working out.
[00:02:32] I believe strongly that good physical condition is one of the evidences of the
[00:02:36] free in a unit as well as of morale in an individual. So it helps both your team and you as a person.
[00:02:43] Now here's where we have a serious beef. Serious beef. Probably one of the most serious beefs
[00:02:51] ever for me with general Clark. This topic is called calistenics at end of day.
[00:03:01] Echo you're probably going to want to throw down with this one. You're going to throw in with him.
[00:03:05] On one occasion I visited a unit and observed calistenics being conducted during the first period
[00:03:10] of the morning. This was being done in the normal way by a junior sergeant conducting the
[00:03:14] exercises with the senior non-commissioned officers and officers standing around to supervise and monitor.
[00:03:22] Possibly the ones who needed the exercise the most were the ones observing. That's a good one.
[00:03:26] You don't want to be that guy. You don't want to be that guy that's standing there with
[00:03:30] a small arms telling people they need to do more pull ups, right? You don't want to find yourself
[00:03:37] in that situation. No, you're not going to. No, sorry. But then he says this, I do not think calistenics
[00:03:44] or other physical training exercise in the first hour of the day is good. Of course, as we know,
[00:03:51] definitely think that working out in the first hour of the day is good. If they are done
[00:03:55] strenuously enough to be of any value so that the men work up the perspiration, the men then
[00:04:02] wear the same wet clothes throughout the day or until such clothing dries off them. Similarly,
[00:04:07] if men performed exercise or requiring them to sit on the ground or lie on the ground, they start
[00:04:11] off the day with dirty and maybe wet clothing. Now for me, general clerk, I'll do respect. I think
[00:04:16] we can just take a shower and change clothes when we're done working out. I think we can overcome
[00:04:21] that in the modern era. Yeah, I got to admit that kind of surprised me as being the first reason
[00:04:27] that he's talking about. Yeah, why not to work out first thing in the morning? Yeah, because we could
[00:04:31] just we could just shower. Seems easy to solve that from you. I will say this though. I think he's
[00:04:38] coming from a time period where they didn't have this full like this was only an idea that was just
[00:04:44] coming to fruition, right? So it wasn't a thing yet. It wasn't a thing to work out. So people didn't
[00:04:49] have work out clothes. People didn't have work out shoes. People didn't have work out bag. You know,
[00:04:57] these people didn't have a workout bag. Didn't have your little freaking re-bock bag or whatever
[00:05:02] that echo Charles takes to 24 hours of fitness. So get your curls on. So they didn't have that back then.
[00:05:10] So he's thinking, yeah, you showed to work and the first thing we're going to do is build up a
[00:05:13] sweat and our going to be wet the clothes all day. All right, we'll give you, we'll cut you some
[00:05:16] slack. And then he says, I believe it is far more reasonable to devote the last hour in the afternoon
[00:05:23] to physical exercising and physical training so that the men can go from it to the showers and get
[00:05:29] into other clothing for supper and the evening. This is the time when the mind is tired and training
[00:05:35] requiring mental attention is least effective. Okay, so that's okay. So all right, so we're going to
[00:05:41] just going to jump past like all the whole thing about the doing you're working out. Because I think
[00:05:44] it's just, I think we're beyond that now in the modern era. Yeah. I don't think we're, I think we can
[00:05:50] work out whenever it makes the most sense not based on our sweat and clothing. I think can we put
[00:05:55] that, can we set that one aside? I agree. So now this is interesting. This is the time when the mind
[00:06:02] is tired and training requiring mental attention is least effective. Doesn't it take a certain
[00:06:07] level of mental effort to do a hard workout? Don't you think? Is it Dave? Yes. I wonder if he's thinking
[00:06:18] like intellectual effort. Right? I get that and I get that too like for instance, this might
[00:06:24] sound stupid. When I'm going to, when I'm going to, let's say it's late at night and I'm like tired
[00:06:34] and I've got some more reading to do. I'll read until I'm just going to fall asleep and then I'll
[00:06:42] get up and brush my teeth, whatever take my supplements as echo likes to say. So I'll do my little
[00:06:48] evening routine floss and then, and then I'll have like, you know, I stood up. So now I'm, I can read a
[00:06:56] little bit longer. I can go a little bit longer and then I go to sleep. So when you do something,
[00:07:01] I guess that, that what I'm saying is you get bored. So maybe this is a good plan. Hey, it's the
[00:07:06] end of the day. You're kind of tired. You don't feel like focusing on this, what you call it, Dave,
[00:07:11] intellectual work. Yeah. Yeah, you don't, you don't, you're, you've spent your intellectual energy,
[00:07:17] but you can still just go jack some steel possibly. Okay. I don't agree. I don't agree. I think
[00:07:24] that that's the case for some of us that like, no, man, when you're mentally exhausted, I mean,
[00:07:31] sure there are some circumstances, but as a general sort of way and approach to working on,
[00:07:36] and no, man, I don't know if I can get there quite yet. Okay. But we'll see what you're doing.
[00:07:40] So you want to have, you want to be mentally fresh for your workout. Yes. Okay.
[00:07:47] All right, back to the book in two divisions at NIN number gate in which I served, everyone
[00:07:50] stopped activities at four o'clock on two days a week with the exception of the necessary
[00:07:55] duty officers, guards and everyone from the, from the commanding general. Everyone from the commanding
[00:07:59] general on down took physical exercises. This physical exercising consisted of activities that
[00:08:05] provided a real workout, none of this echo Charles. Real workout. Certain well organized selected
[00:08:14] games were allowed, provided that everyone played organized calisthenics were allowed, but the bulk
[00:08:20] of the units engaged in a four mile trot and fast walk to be completed in 50 minutes. Yes,
[00:08:28] bro, we're talking 12 minute miles or whatever. This is not a challenge.
[00:08:34] And here's what, as I thought through this, it started to make a little bit more sense.
[00:08:37] Combat boots with proper socks were worn by all personnel in order to get the men used to
[00:08:41] prevent damage to their feet, right? Above the top of the boots, everyone was permitted to
[00:08:45] prescribe their own uniform within the realm of decency. This gave men a feeling of freedom
[00:08:50] which added to the relaxation and benefit of exercise. Okay. So that's cool. I do not think
[00:08:55] this lack of uniformity hurt the discipline of the unit. It was not a show. Men traveled the
[00:09:02] previously laid out formal courses as individuals being checked at the start and finished
[00:09:07] to record their times in order to motivate the slow ones by falling. So this is just, you know,
[00:09:12] you just kind of prescribes this weird like four mile walk that everyone's going to go on,
[00:09:18] which tells me earlier when I said they weren't that working out wasn't really like a thing.
[00:09:24] Yeah, it wasn't because if they're thinking 50 minutes and four miles, but the only thing I can say
[00:09:30] about that also is if you're talking about a whole division or a whole brigade of people,
[00:09:37] like these are not all front line soldiers, obviously. These are administrative people and
[00:09:44] whatever the general himself. So yeah, I don't know. By falling the courses individuals instead of
[00:09:52] formation, no one exercise so strenuously as to do himself damage regardless of his physical
[00:09:57] condition or age, care should be taken in starting such a program to work into a reasonably
[00:10:04] so as not to increase the sick call rate. I think if you if you imagine like a corporation,
[00:10:11] like a giant corporation and division size corporation with whatever 10 or 15,000 people
[00:10:17] and they were going to start a physical training program, this might be an okay program. You got 50 minutes,
[00:10:22] you got to go out, you got to move four miles, go for a walk, whatever. I think that's
[00:10:26] I think that's almost the perspective that he's coming from.
[00:10:35] I don't know, though, because didn't he just say a real work? Yeah, and there should be
[00:10:39] sweating. I mean, I'm not sweating after a after 12 minute miles for four miles and I swear to
[00:10:45] a lot as you know. Well, let's just be thankful that we are where we are, where we've learned
[00:10:54] so much about physical training and which has changed a lot. I mean, did you see that picture I
[00:11:00] posed at the other day of I was like yelling at one of my friends back in the day and he's doing
[00:11:05] cable crossover. I couldn't tell what he's doing. He's doing just cable crossovers. Yeah, oh yeah.
[00:11:13] Hardcore building the thing that's building the what the lower packs.
[00:11:21] Leave it to you to try to yell at him while he's doing that. It's just like you think dead
[00:11:26] I think we were just messing around actually. Physical exercise program, the Secretary of
[00:11:30] the Army has written to commanders about the tendency to move troops from barracks to work and
[00:11:34] from barracks to training areas by vehicle instead of marching them when it is practical. Well,
[00:11:40] two march. He pointed out that is very important that the troops retain the ability to march
[00:11:44] and especially was and this was especially important in mechanized and motorized armor units. So
[00:11:51] that's a great point. When you have the opportunity to march instead of riding a vehicle,
[00:11:57] you should march instead of riding a vehicle. That's one thing that's cool about buds. In buds,
[00:12:03] you run to dent, you run to breakfast and back, you run to lunch and back, you run to dinner and back.
[00:12:08] It's milder, it's milder. You're doing six miles a day before anything. Before the day before you
[00:12:13] get credit for anything, you ran six miles. Yeah. As a pilot, do you, because I was watching some
[00:12:20] videos of some pilots that I came across. And do you guys kind of have to stay in physical
[00:12:28] condition just to endure like flying a plane essentially? I mean, the physical fitness standards
[00:12:35] are universal across the Marine Corps and all the same. There is a unique level of fitness that
[00:12:43] is associated with flying and it kind of comes and goes with how much flying you're doing.
[00:12:47] But there's not like a separate type of aviation fitness other than there are things about
[00:12:51] aviation that will fatigue you that you won't get fatigue doing other things and that's two
[00:12:56] for other things as well. But like the PT in the Marine Corps doesn't they don't care what your job is.
[00:13:01] Can you train for the, like, let's say you did a disassociated tour and you weren't flying
[00:13:08] for 18 months and now you knew you were going back to a squadron you were going to be flying.
[00:13:13] Is there any exercises that you could do to get ready for flying? You can't train for G
[00:13:18] tolerance. Exactly. So that's a perishable thing. You know, there's a, you know, a
[00:13:24] robegan anaerobic, there's certain muscles that are good to be strengthened. But if you have
[00:13:29] him phone, it's the Gs that will that you cannot train for. You can't replicate those Gs and
[00:13:34] you can't train for those Gs at all. Well, I mean, okay, let me challenge you. Now you can train
[00:13:39] for the technique and you can train to the muscles to do that, but you can't replicate the actual
[00:13:45] feeling of the Gs. But that being said, if you take someone that's in really good shape,
[00:13:50] versus someone that's not really good shape, the person that's in really good shape is going to do better.
[00:13:54] But maybe, I mean, okay, I mean, you have to use your muscles. Yeah, you do, but like larger
[00:14:03] muscles don't, don't mean better G tolerance. But what about just conditioning? Yeah, no, absolutely.
[00:14:12] Yes, a better condition person is going to be able to endure all things being equal,
[00:14:19] be able to endure the rigors of flying more than the other person, but that doesn't mean he's
[00:14:22] going to have a higher G tolerance. Did I ever tell you about my buddy, what, what, when my
[00:14:28] platoons all went backseat in the F-18s? So we went through the whatever training you go through,
[00:14:34] so you can get called to go the backseat. So we all go through, well, he showed up late. And so he missed
[00:14:40] the whole briefing on how to, what is it called, how to push the blood to your brain? He missed all that,
[00:14:47] and then he missed whatever, and then he showed up, I think he was out. I think he was breaking the night before.
[00:14:53] And so there's a little covered move and like we snuck him back into the class and put his name on the
[00:14:57] roster and it's all good. Well, then he showed me, we get up to Fallen and he didn't know what to do. He just
[00:15:03] got in the plane. He's like, cool, I know what, you know, whatever. And he passed out the entire time.
[00:15:07] So he, he was just like wake up and then just pass out again because he didn't know to, to put the
[00:15:13] blood to his head. He didn't know to do that. So he just passed it out and they had video on it.
[00:15:16] Does that make sense that they had video of it? Totally. He was just, he was just flopping around the
[00:15:20] thing in the cockpit and we were laughing and he said, I had no idea. He just didn't remember anything.
[00:15:26] He was just passing out. Yep. Well, can she get like hurt like that? Like if you passed out
[00:15:31] Olympian, can't you neck? Because you know those that video that you play at the mustard that die
[00:15:36] in the what he would he called those diffusions. And he, he passes out and it's like probably
[00:15:42] still getting smashed from the force. Yeah. I don't think there's any real risk of
[00:15:47] pervangering from doing that. It's more just being humiliated. Yeah. Yeah. That's actually that's what
[00:15:53] I was that's what I meant like do you guys train? Do you guys have a specific like training or
[00:15:57] team for that? Because man, you don't really realize that I mean, maybe do, maybe don't. You don't
[00:16:03] but when you see guys flying planes and doing all that stuff, you don't really understand like what
[00:16:07] you're going through physically in there, you know, right? Is there an ideal physical build for
[00:16:12] fighter pilot? I don't think so, man. I mean, just like with every marine, there are all shapes and
[00:16:18] sizes. I mean, my body type is drastically different than others. And if you were going to be an
[00:16:25] F-18 pilot or let's say an F-35 pilot, you were going to design an F-35 pilot human. Yeah. How
[00:16:31] tall would that human be? Six foot. How much would they weigh? 190 pounds. So that's it. Does
[00:16:38] like, so there is an ideal. That's because if he's six four, he's cramped in the cockpit. If he's six,
[00:16:44] if he's five, five, he can't reach the pedal over there. Right? I mean, there's issues.
[00:16:51] There are there are legitimate anthropometric issues that is a truth. And like you get measured
[00:16:57] all these odd measurements like angled or like elbow to wrist, like angled to knee. There's all sorts of
[00:17:03] physical measurements. The window is pretty broad. And even, you know, for me to say six foot 190,
[00:17:09] I'm just talking about like a lean, strong guy. Does that mean a five foot six, a hundred and 25 pound
[00:17:16] person can't be good about? No, they totally absolutely can't. Absolutely can't. With that person,
[00:17:20] maybe struggle a little bit with like looking over the shore? Yeah. They wouldn't. They're by
[00:17:24] type as if you're six four in your banging your head against the canopy, which guys in my
[00:17:27] squadron, guys whose call signs were stretch because they were so tall. At the end of the day,
[00:17:32] I don't think any would come back and say, I'm better because of my build or my height. So even that
[00:17:36] answer is like the window is broad enough to say then anybody and there's pilots out there,
[00:17:42] that are pretty good pilots out there that aren't six foot 190. Is there a cut off?
[00:17:46] Hi, or minimum technically? Yeah, I think it's pretty small. I think it's very short like
[00:17:52] five one five two, you know, you can accommodate someone that short and I think I've known guys
[00:17:57] that are six five six six flying fighters. So dang, there's a big window in there. Do they call
[00:18:04] a pedals? They do. They call the pedals. Now they're adjustable. So the image of not being able
[00:18:10] to reach the pedals is more fun. But I'll tell you what, as a taller guy, a taller dude and
[00:18:17] there's, you know, when you get into an airplane that somebody else has flown and they're on
[00:18:20] the shorter side, you get in your, you're, you're, you know, it's like being in the back seat of a car
[00:18:24] and you immediately have to push those pedals all the way back because the dude in front of you is
[00:18:28] way shorter than you. So it's adjustable like a cat-alact. It is. It's the adjustment is not too far away
[00:18:34] from the, the cockpit temperature adjuster. Oh, that's right. You know, you can adjust that
[00:18:39] temperature. Check. All right, going on. I do not wish to discourage anyone who gets exercise from
[00:18:45] golf tennis bowling hunting, fishing, gardening, walking skiing, etc. In fact, I encourage such
[00:18:50] activities during off time. When spring arrives in long daylight hours of the year with us, it's
[00:18:57] good time to start physical training program. He goes on. A commander should have no objection to
[00:19:03] to, to the closing of any headquarters at four o'clock two days a week in order to devote this
[00:19:08] time to physical exercising. Nor should he object to the stopping of other activities in most T O E units,
[00:19:15] at four o'clock two afternoons a week for this purpose. So he's talking about you should always
[00:19:21] train two days a week, which once again, I mean, in the Marine Corps, you guys do PT every single day,
[00:19:28] right? Well, not aviation units. Oh, really? Yeah, I mean, when I was with the ground units,
[00:19:35] there was every single day and there was a time allocated to that. The squadrons that I would in,
[00:19:40] I was in, didn't do five day week, five day week PT. I thought that was pre-standard in the home military.
[00:19:48] Well, that's what he's saying. He's saying only two days a week. Yeah, I mean, I think what he's saying,
[00:19:52] it's interesting, because you mentioned the common, this guy was, you know, steeped in the world
[00:19:56] or won. This is a guy saying you need to prioritize time for PT. Now, I mean, two days a week,
[00:20:02] now looking back as, you know, reflecting on that, but he was probably a pioneer saying,
[00:20:06] hey, commanders, shut your unit down to go work out. Yeah. And you should do that. Like,
[00:20:10] that's okay as opposed to, hey, we got to get this paperwork going or this,
[00:20:13] whatever other thing going on is so he might have been out in front of the curve for all I know
[00:20:17] for the, for the era that he was in saying, it's okay from the general down in the private,
[00:20:21] is it shut down normal ops to go to the unit. No, absolutely. I, you know, I believe you're 100%
[00:20:27] right? He was the guy that was spearheading working out. Look, you got to get out there two days
[00:20:33] a week. He doesn't even say minimum, right? Because that would be sort of like, hey,
[00:20:38] minimum two days a week. He's saying two days a week. You got to get out there.
[00:20:43] In connection with this physical exercise program, I think we might well give thought to delaying
[00:20:48] the evening meal on Monday through Friday in order to give them more time to get cleaned up
[00:20:52] shallard and dress to the, they will not feel the or urge to rush right to work,
[00:20:57] well, right from work to supper. This was, this, at the reason I want to read the sections,
[00:21:02] this would have advantages other than physical conditioning by serving the evening meal in the
[00:21:07] enlisted messes as early as we do. We leave the soldier with over six hours of time after supper
[00:21:13] before he is scheduled to be in bed to do things that sometimes lead to trouble. More exercise
[00:21:19] in a later meal hour in the afternoon would tend to reduce free time in the evening and would
[00:21:24] absorb energies and would encourage them to go to bed earlier. It has been found to be an overall
[00:21:30] advantage to serve the heavy meal at night instead of a noon on duty days. I believe we
[00:21:35] give enough time off to our food service people so they can live with these changes in the feeding
[00:21:40] program. Oh, that's so classic. Alcohol, I've written before chapter three about the
[00:21:50] intent, use of alcohol and the end of the desire, ability of cutting down on the quantity of
[00:21:55] consumption of alcohol. One of the reasons for this is to help improve the physical condition
[00:22:00] of our officers and men. Obesity, I would like to say a word about personnel being overweight,
[00:22:06] while they are not very many such personnel in most commands. There are some who are eating
[00:22:13] more than their physical activity burns up. The commander should bring this to the attention of
[00:22:17] such individuals with a view to more exercising or less eating or both other problems.
[00:22:25] This is the last section. Other problems. This is just a broad statement. This is something
[00:22:33] that echo that you used to say all the time on this podcast. Other problems, I believe that
[00:22:38] such a program as I suggested will automatically help to solve the problem in those units which
[00:22:44] have one of men and garrison changing out of fatigues for evening social activities. It should
[00:22:49] help reduce other unfavorable statistics as well. You used to say on this podcast all the time,
[00:22:54] echo that the most universally helpful thing that a person can do is exercise. It will help you
[00:23:03] in all aspects of whatever you're doing, which is a good point. What he said is, hey, if you exercise,
[00:23:11] every problem that you have is going to be improved. So echo is the pioneer on that one.
[00:23:19] There's something you said I was thinking about in my contrast between aviation, my time in a
[00:23:23] fighter squadron versus my time in Anglicore, which is kind of the biggest contrast is, and I don't
[00:23:29] know how it is elsewhere, but the infantry or the ground units when I was with them have a kind of
[00:23:35] pre-regimen like their days and it's kind of a typical workday, whereas a fighter squadron operates
[00:23:39] 24 hours a day. So they're running in shifts the whole time. So standard work week is there's always
[00:23:45] a third or a half of the unit there from Sunday night till Friday afternoon. So that cycle is a little,
[00:23:51] it's kind of thinking in my head just the getting the whole unit together and in this in a squadron
[00:23:56] almost never happens. You're at best you're going to have like even when you're doing your work up,
[00:24:01] you run in that work up is, work up is probably even worse because work ups, you know, the flying
[00:24:06] schedule shifts are on a bunch to get all these different calls, but you I would say routinely
[00:24:11] the best you're ever going to get is half your squadron there at any given time. Most of the time,
[00:24:15] not always like that, but I would say 90% of a typical fighter squadron cycle is you have two or three
[00:24:21] shifts and you'll never have more than half your squadron there at any given time.
[00:24:26] Well before the war in the 90s at the team, we used to PT as a team five days a week, as a team.
[00:24:33] Maybe one day would be what they call the individual PT, which guys would legitimately individual
[00:24:38] PT, they'd go do whatever, you know, do jits or whatever they were going to do. But the other days
[00:24:43] it was like, oh, Mondays are run, Tuesdays is swim, Wednesdays individual PT, Thursdays,
[00:24:49] oh course, Friday's Monster Mash. That was kind of a typical schedule at the end of the
[00:24:55] back in the group. What's the Monster Mash is just, oh course, both paddle just come up with
[00:25:01] some crazy sort of various, what would you call it? I don't know what you, it'd be like one of those
[00:25:06] um, you ever see those TV physical competitions where they're doing all these up, like you'd run
[00:25:13] the obstacle course, then you would do berm runs, but you would be in a little team. So it'd just be
[00:25:18] some kind of, we call it a Monster Mash. Like American Ninja Warrior? Yeah, like American Ninja Warrior,
[00:25:23] but as teams. Gotcha. And is the platoon back in the, this is obviously pre-war, but back in
[00:25:29] was the platoon kind of together all the time. Yeah, so the platoon was together, but the team wasn't.
[00:25:34] So there'd be two platoons out in the desert. There'd be, no, there'd be one platoon out of the
[00:25:38] desert. There'd be one platoon up a foul and there'd be another platoon in the jungle somewhere,
[00:25:42] but there'd still be three platoons back at the team and all the support people from the team.
[00:25:47] So the platoon is like that was the element that at the lowest level, they were together. You
[00:25:52] didn't really break up platoon's very often. Not very often. That's cool. You're going through your work
[00:25:56] up together, but you gotta remember a seal platoon is small. Right. A seal platoon is only 16
[00:26:01] guys. Sometimes in the past, we bumped them up to 18. Sometimes we've even bumped them up to 21,
[00:26:07] depending on manning and personnel and mission, but the general seal platoon 16 people. And post, post
[00:26:15] war did that become the task unit was together for the most part, but they did almost like
[00:26:20] elevate up that they yes. Then they all the sudden they, they made the task unit, which is two
[00:26:26] platoons together with a headquarters unit over it. And they had the idea, it took them all
[00:26:31] a while to like actually make it happen. So there were some good vision on the bond behalf of
[00:26:36] naval special warfare commanders to say, actually, you know what, we should probably put a bigger unit
[00:26:43] together. Because 16 guys is very limiting. Right. What can you do with 16 guys? I mean, if you
[00:26:49] man up vehicles with 16 guys, you man up, whatever, you man up three vehicles. Now there's six people
[00:26:56] in those vehicles. Driver gunner, driver gunner, driver gunner, you put the rest of the guys in
[00:27:00] that that gives you 10 assaulters. What can you take down with 10 assaulters? The answer is not very many.
[00:27:04] So went into a task unit mode with now you had two platoons plus you had headquarters and then
[00:27:09] you get attachments of EOD and maybe you get a some kind of a radio man to help you out. So all
[00:27:14] of a sudden, you know, you got 35 or 40 guys going out the door. So it turns into a better situation.
[00:27:20] It's a really good call. I remember one of the, one of the first things I was in a platoon,
[00:27:27] I was in an org platoon, which meant we were going out on a ship and we had to do hydrographic
[00:27:31] reconnaissance, which is old school, lead line and slate. Lead line and slate meaning you had a
[00:27:36] lead line, you had a piece of rope with a piece of lead on the bottom and you you tied little knots
[00:27:43] every six feet for fathoms and you would go and swim in a line and dip that lead line and see how deep
[00:27:49] the water was and then you died for obstacles before the Marines came in. This is World War II straight
[00:27:54] up UDT underwater demolition team stuff. Well, when you're in the org platoon, you actually did that a lot
[00:28:00] because you were supporting Marine Corps landings. So so we were, we had a 16 man platoon and I didn't
[00:28:09] an org like that with 16 guys and it was really hard because you have a, you have a boat party
[00:28:13] of guys and then you have like a radio man. So there's two or three guys that aren't in the water
[00:28:18] and somebody's staying with the boat. So there's another two guys that are not in the water. So all of a
[00:28:22] sudden you've got you've only got seven guys to do the recon or nine guys to do the recon or whatever.
[00:28:29] So that's, that's not good. So I remember writing a point paper. I was like an E4 and I wrote a
[00:28:36] point paper to my commanding officer that the org platoons should have four more personnel in the platoon.
[00:28:43] And I think we actually got like they gave us like two more guys. Pretty cool.
[00:28:48] So, I mean, who did I think I'm was such a, it's pretty funny. I look back at that.
[00:28:56] I standard naval letter format when I'm sent to you. I know I try. Yeah. I know I tried, but the
[00:29:02] cool thing was, you know, my commanding officer at the time was like, you know, that makes sense.
[00:29:05] Hey, we can't give you four, but we can give you two. Make it an 18 man platoon. We had an 18 man
[00:29:10] platoon. I'm pretty sure. I can't even remember. You know what's weird is, I can't even remember what
[00:29:16] yeah, I don't, I can't remember if he gave us two more people. Maybe give us one more. I think he gave
[00:29:22] us at least one more person because I think I know exactly who it was. But anyways, all right. So there's
[00:29:29] the physical conditioning thing. The next section is called chapter 12, the creating of superior units.
[00:29:41] Four basic principles. I have found that there are four basic principles which apply to the
[00:29:45] problem of creating army units which are considered superior. First, the superior unit must be
[00:29:53] created from the ordinary run of personnel. How awesome is that? You're going to make a superior
[00:30:01] unit. But anybody that's ever served in the military knows that you're going to get what you get.
[00:30:09] And yet we all know that there's units that are freaking awesome and there's units that are horrible.
[00:30:15] And both the awesome units and the horrible units have run of the mill people in them. They came from
[00:30:21] the, they come from the same pool of soldiers in this case. It's all the same people. You don't get
[00:30:25] to pick your little team of your superstar athletes in this case. And it's the same thing in business,
[00:30:32] right? It's the same thing in business. You get businesses that are in the same market
[00:30:38] and one of them is crushing and the other one's not. Well, why is that? Why is that? You're both
[00:30:44] getting to hire from the same group of human beings in the country, whatever country you're in.
[00:30:50] So the superior unit must be created from the ordinary run of personnel second, classified according
[00:30:56] to ability, the men in a unit fall naturally into three groupings, upper, middle and lower. The
[00:31:02] excellence of a unit depends upon the ability of the commander to bring the men of the lower group to a
[00:31:08] degree of proficiency which makes them an asset to his unit team. So this is we're going to
[00:31:14] get a some stuff where I'm, I'm not sure about. I'm not sure about this is one of them. And he talks
[00:31:22] about a little bit more. I mean, he talks about your focus being making the people that are,
[00:31:26] he's basically saying you got a really good people, middle people and bad people. He's saying
[00:31:30] the focus is like, make the bad people better, make the bad people a, a, a, a plus for the unit.
[00:31:36] I don't necessarily agree with that. I agree with that, should be a focus, a singular focus,
[00:31:44] I don't think it should be the full. I would rather take my people to the top and make them totally
[00:31:48] awesome and make my people that are in the middle like really, really good. I'm not going to focus
[00:31:54] my efforts on the turds. The reason I didn't say anything when you, when you read that, because I had
[00:32:01] a little like, is I'm going to listen what General Clark has to say before I get to me, but that
[00:32:07] at, on its face, though, when you said that, my first thing was was, oh, okay, I don't think that's
[00:32:12] right, but I'm, obviously he's going to say something about it, but we get this question and business
[00:32:18] all the time. Is, is they, leaders will devote all their attention to their bottom performers,
[00:32:21] like almost all their attention. It's like, why would you invest all of your time in your least
[00:32:27] productive people? Why wouldn't you invest most of your, most of your time in your most productive
[00:32:32] people? I get, you don't, you don't ignore those people, but if you're devoting, and again,
[00:32:36] let, he's going to say something. I'm sure. But when you said that, I had that reaction of,
[00:32:41] well, it's like if you, let's say, on a level of 1 to 5, you're a 5, and echo is a 1.
[00:32:50] 1 being the worst 5 being the best. So if I take my efforts, and I'm able to,
[00:32:58] I'm able to double your power, I can turn you into a 10, I can only turn echo into a 2.
[00:33:03] 2 exponentially positive returns on Dave Burke. Kind of not. All right, next. Third,
[00:33:13] all men that does, this is such, this is such an interesting one. Third, all men desire to do
[00:33:21] what is wanted of them. All men desire to do what is wanted of them. Okay, so that's the first
[00:33:31] part. So let's, let's absorb that, and then he goes on to just take some ownership here,
[00:33:37] when they do not, it is because they have not been adequately motivated and instructed.
[00:33:46] So have you ever had anybody in your squadron that straight up just didn't want to do what was,
[00:33:54] what was wanted of them? You know, I would say yes in the sense that, yeah, there are people
[00:34:02] that I've had in my units that fit that bill, and we did something about that. His point, I understand
[00:34:09] his point though, and the idea that I'm going to write that person office unwilling to do it,
[00:34:16] to me, it was more like, how much of my, how much energy am I going to devote to try to find the
[00:34:22] way that gets you to our need to be? So while I don't disagree with that comment, yeah, I've
[00:34:28] had people in my, in my sphere, multiple times throughout my career that simply didn't get what
[00:34:34] they needed to be. And could you say, hey, that's sort of a fault of leader? Yes, 100%. But the leader
[00:34:40] also still has to make a little measurement of, am I going to devote 100% of my time to getting
[00:34:44] that guy from a one, two, a two? Remember to go, hey man, this investment in you right now is going
[00:34:48] to take away from all this other stuff, and I'm going to cut you loose. Yeah, and by the way, what's what's
[00:34:52] 10 times zero? Yeah, if the person's a zero, well now, so listen, I think all men is an overstatement.
[00:35:02] I think you could throw a percentage on there. That's upwards of 97%. Yeah, 97% that want to
[00:35:10] want, they want to do a good job. They want to do a good job. And to his point, as a leader, your default
[00:35:18] should be, is that they're not the problem. Your default to be is the percentage is so high that
[00:35:22] you might as well just go in the assumption that the problem isn't with them. So that 97% is,
[00:35:28] I think actually correct not all, but I think it's point two is like, hey, if you're in charge of
[00:35:33] people and they're not, they're not up to standards, you need to spend most of your time
[00:35:37] figuring out what you're doing wrong. Yeah, most people don't need to be fired that need to be
[00:35:41] led. I think we wrote that in extreme ownership or in dichotomy leadership. I think it's in
[00:35:45] dichotomy leadership. Most people don't need to be fired. They need to be led. Most people. Yeah.
[00:35:49] All people? No, you're going to get, and you know when you see this, and I don't,
[00:35:53] well, you didn't get to see this because you were an officer, then you went through OCS. When you go
[00:35:59] through like Navy Bootcamp, you see some people that don't want to be there. They do not want to
[00:36:05] be there. They're there for 15 minutes. Like this ain't for me. And they're going to do whatever
[00:36:09] they got to do to get, they don't want to do what is wanted of them. They don't. Yeah. They want out.
[00:36:16] Fourth, the best unit in an organization is always the one which is excellent or better in all things.
[00:36:24] If you agree with these precepts, let us analyze and apply them to the basic problem of the
[00:36:29] commander who is striving for a superior unit. Application to the units, applications of the principal
[00:36:34] student. The problems of polishing ordinary units until they emerge a superior are primarily the
[00:36:40] problems of raising individual performance and capabilities to a superior level. The many truly
[00:36:45] outstanding units which have been produced in our army, giving, giving ample evidence that these
[00:36:50] problems can be solved. Based on the fact that they're percentile scores on the AFQT, which is
[00:36:59] like the AzVab, which is the basic intelligence test that you take when you're coming in the military,
[00:37:05] as in the list of guys. Do you take it to become an officer? Yeah. No, no, take it. Take the AzVab.
[00:37:09] Yes, absolutely. Okay. So you take like a basic test. It's sort of an SAT and ACT type test.
[00:37:18] Totally. How smart are you? It's basically what it is. And then he ranks it out in three groups.
[00:37:23] And it's the upper third, the middle third, the lower third. But he's got this little thing in here.
[00:37:28] And he's got the scores listed and I'm not going to go into those. But the upper third is
[00:37:36] 11 percent and 34. So the upper, the top two groups combined, make up 45 percent. So 45
[00:37:44] percent of people are in the 65 percentile and higher of that testing. 43 percent are in the middle.
[00:37:52] So you're almost done. And then the last 12 percent is people that are in not below a group,
[00:37:57] but the second of the lowest group. So if you get between 0 and 9 on the on the AzVab,
[00:38:02] and these aren't, this is actually the AFQT, which is the old AzVab. So the scores won't correlate
[00:38:07] to what we know about since we didn't take the AzVab in 19th. We can take the AFQT in 1958.
[00:38:14] So what he's saying is you're going to get mostly people that are either in the middle group
[00:38:20] or in the higher group, which is great. Now I'm sure that there's some people that are
[00:38:23] think, wow, that's the difference. You know, I'm in the civilian world and we get these people.
[00:38:27] They're, they're not, no. When you start talking about people that are in the lowest scoring
[00:38:34] brackets of the, of the AzVab, like they can't get in the military, but they're also not going to be
[00:38:42] applying for a job with that's going to take some some high level cognitive abilities.
[00:38:47] They're, they're just not going to be there. So I've got a very interesting book that I'm going to
[00:38:52] cover on the podcast and, and it's, it's really, it's, I've been reading it for a while. I've actually
[00:38:59] actually actually showed it to you several months ago because I've been stewing on it, but
[00:39:03] it's during the Vietnam War, they, they needed people. They needed people,
[00:39:12] to be in the military. They needed people to be in the military to go to Vietnam. And so they
[00:39:17] started to lower the standards and the main standard that they lowered was the, the IQ level,
[00:39:24] or I don't know if you want to call it the IQ level, but that's basically what's the intellectual
[00:39:27] level, the, the, the intelligence level. And they started getting these, these people in the military
[00:39:34] that were just, they just didn't have the mental capacity to, to do really any job.
[00:39:43] Um, even, and you know, you know, you think about in the military, there's some pretty,
[00:39:48] there's some jobs that don't take a lot of intellectual horsepower, right? I mean,
[00:39:52] you need people that are going to clean the, the toilets, you know, you got, you got some, you know,
[00:39:57] you got a people that are going to, and look, these are what we, this is what I did when I got
[00:40:01] the military, right? When I got the seal teams, I was cleaning toilets, but then you, you're,
[00:40:05] you're going to move up and you're going to move on, but at some place you need some people that
[00:40:08] are going to have some pretty fundamentally non-high cognitive skill requirement jobs.
[00:40:19] Well, they started letting people in that this didn't have the capability. It's a really sad,
[00:40:22] and these guys, a lot of these guys went to Vietnam. They had, obviously, that higher casualty rate,
[00:40:26] that higher, more of them got killed, because they just didn't, they just didn't understand things.
[00:40:32] And the guy that wrote this book that I'm reading, he went, he's talking about going through bootcamp.
[00:40:36] And he basically gets paired up with one of these guys, and all the drone structures knew it.
[00:40:42] They called him like McNamara's morons. That's what they'd call these guys when they'd come in.
[00:40:48] And he got assigned one of these guys basically to, to help get him through bootcamp. And one of the
[00:40:54] most, like one of the opening scenes is they're telling him, hey, you know, right, right your address
[00:41:01] on this postcard and write a message to your family. And not only did he not know how to write,
[00:41:07] but he didn't even know what his address was. He didn't even know what his, what street he lived on.
[00:41:12] It didn't, he didn't know that it teach him how to tie his shoes. And they had to teach him how to
[00:41:17] tie his shoes, not just hey, this is how you do it. No, like, they had to teach him
[00:41:21] for extended periods of time how to tie his shoes. So these are people that are really in a,
[00:41:28] really, you know, in a low intellectual level. And we brought, I think, was about a hundred
[00:41:34] thousand of them into the military, which is just uns, just horrible, just horrible.
[00:41:41] So my point in saying all that is we're talking about, you know, in this civilian sector,
[00:41:48] you're not getting that person either to apply for your job in accounting, right? So don't think
[00:41:52] to yourself, well, you know, my accounting department, they're my guys, my people are,
[00:41:56] they're, they're not smart either. No one I talking about that. We're not talking about that.
[00:42:03] So he goes on to say that those in the upper groupings are the best educated and quick
[00:42:10] as to learn, can be well motivated, but need to be challenged to develop their full potential.
[00:42:15] The middle groupings are average run of American use. They're easily controlled.
[00:42:19] They're both take well the discipline, learn easily, respond to good leadership, but are usually
[00:42:25] capable of more than and they must be pushed. The lower groupings are the ones that need special attention.
[00:42:31] And again, this is where you and I are kind of like, hmm, the lower groupings are the ones who need
[00:42:35] special attention. The disciplinary problem in this group is higher than average. I agree with that.
[00:42:40] The individuals require special motivation instruction. I agree with that. They're attitude,
[00:42:45] constitutes a special barometer of the spread of core of the unit. This group contains also
[00:42:53] many of the misfits who, if they cannot be assimilated, must be eliminated.
[00:42:59] So it's interesting that he's calling for like special attention on this lower group.
[00:43:08] And then he says in a single squad, crew, go, well, I'm just, I'm thinking in my mind as I'm
[00:43:14] hearing you talk about this. Just things that I've heard you say on this podcast, things we've
[00:43:17] talked about on your podcast. And I'm trying to kind of consider what's in general,
[00:43:23] Clark's head as I'm hearing this. Obviously, I'm trying to put myself in his position.
[00:43:27] We've talked about this before and I think the way you said it was anybody on your team
[00:43:32] has the potential to undo your entire plan. And so I'm trying to make this connection
[00:43:39] ahead of the things he's talking about, why you devote so much effort to these people. And I'm
[00:43:43] just trying to place them out of why he's saying it the way he's saying it, which there is,
[00:43:49] if they're on your team and you keep them on your team, these aren't people you get rid of,
[00:43:51] but they're on your team and they are under performers, a little performance. They still have the
[00:43:55] potential of undoing your plan. And so I'm trying to piece the things that he's thinking,
[00:44:00] almost, I don't know what he's going to say, but I do understand that. You know, the flip side of
[00:44:05] that, the other thing I've been thinking about, we work with companies that some of the companies
[00:44:08] we work with, how this philosophy is, hey, we're going to pay more. And we're going to track to higher,
[00:44:14] higher bar, a higher average level because we are a higher paying organization. So we're going to,
[00:44:20] and there's a bunch of economic theory behind that. And their belief is that they're going to
[00:44:23] track better talent. And you know what they end up with? The exact same problems is all other organizations.
[00:44:28] They still have a bell curve. They still have under performers. And this is something you said too,
[00:44:32] is even in the sealed teams and people create this image on their mind of what a seal is and
[00:44:36] they're, you know, the superhuman. And how many times have you said no, they're people,
[00:44:42] the exact same thing at Top Gun where people place these guys on a pedestal. If they're
[00:44:46] somehow all of them uniquely capable, we had a bottom 12% at Top Gun 2. We had under performers
[00:44:55] at Top Gun just like everyone else. So for me to think about it, if you're in a leadership role,
[00:45:00] the takeaway from this is that what is required for all this is your leadership more than anything.
[00:45:07] Now, I do want to hear his thoughts on that, but your under performance can still undo your plan.
[00:45:13] And there's no like free pass of, hey, we just have a better screening process. We don't
[00:45:16] weed out those people. We know that that's not true. Those problems exist in the same bell
[00:45:21] curve in any, every organization. Yeah. And the other thing that affects the bell curve is the bar
[00:45:27] that everyone has to be staying above. So the bottom 12% at Top Gun, they're the bottom,
[00:45:35] tell a percent of Top Gun, they may be the top tier of some other organization somewhere,
[00:45:42] but at Top Gun they're the bottom 12% and they're making the same kind of mistakes relative
[00:45:48] to their job. It's the same thing in the seal teams like, oh yeah, the the seal teams, they have
[00:45:53] a, we have a bottom part of the bell curve. Now, those people might be really good if they had
[00:45:59] some other jobs somewhere. You know, in Task Unit, Bruce, we had to get rid of one guy. It was a
[00:46:05] great guy. He was a hard worker. He just didn't quite have the capacity to get the job done.
[00:46:10] I guarantee he went to his next unit in the Navy and was the best sailor they had. I can, I can, I can
[00:46:15] guarantee that because he was a hard worker. He wanted to do a good job. He just didn't quite have
[00:46:22] that decision-making process. And maybe I shouldn't have said the best sailor, but he's going to be
[00:46:27] a really good guy, a really good guy. And so, but the bar is higher for what you're being required
[00:46:36] to do. Right? This is what you're like a top gun. You're being required to fly this jet at these
[00:46:43] at these G's and make these decisions and maneuver and remember what's happening and debrief
[00:46:48] and communicate and pay attention to nine different things at the same time. You're required to do
[00:46:52] all that stuff. And the people that are barely able to do it, they're the bottom of the bell curve.
[00:46:59] You put them, you know, driving an Uber and they're going to be the best freaking Uber driver.
[00:47:04] You know, in, well, at least in the top, let's say the top 5% of Uber driver because I've had
[00:47:09] some damn good Uber drivers before. So, so, yes, that bell curve exists everywhere. You're not going
[00:47:16] to get away from it and you do have to lead. And I agree with your point. Why general clerk might
[00:47:25] be saying, hey, you're going to pay attention to that bottom 12% because no one in the top
[00:47:33] 88% is going to, well, there's a much less chance of them torpedoing your whole mission. Right?
[00:47:42] Those knuckleheads, they're holding the freaking trigger to the torpedo and they could fire that
[00:47:48] thing off at any moment. So, you got to pay attention to them. That might be the, the, the genesis of
[00:47:53] his, of his focus on these individuals. That probably where the, what's the thing? You're only
[00:48:01] as strong as your weakest link kind of. Yeah. The loss of your head. Yep. Yeah. Maybe that's where
[00:48:06] it came from. It's, it's from that, definitely from that concept that broad concept. Yeah. He goes on
[00:48:14] here. Single squad crew or section will probably contain men of all three groupings. Certainly,
[00:48:18] they will appear in any platoon or company. This presents a practical problem in the handling and
[00:48:22] instructing of men in, in perfecting the teamwork of the squad crew, second or platoon. The leader
[00:48:28] can afford to adopt only one approach to handling his men. He must assume that they all want to
[00:48:36] do what he wants done. When any number do not respond to this assumption, the fault is more
[00:48:43] probably his than theirs. So, his assumption is everyone wants to, that's a greatest assumption to
[00:48:49] make. The assumption and that's what I like about this assumption that all men want to do what
[00:48:53] what is wanted them to do, what, what we want them to do. That's a great assumption to make because
[00:48:58] that means when they don't, it's our fault. And that's exactly what he's saying. He's taking full
[00:49:01] ownership. And then he says, this is like, oh, what's word for word for something that I
[00:49:05] brief on. What is on a daily basis to companies? If they don't respond, he should check his procedures,
[00:49:11] instructions, and subordinate leaders to determine where in lies the trouble. When only one or two
[00:49:17] individuals are involved, punitive action or elimination, maybe an indicated. So, if you got a platoon
[00:49:22] or a company, you got a company of 150 people and everyone gets it except for two guys. Okay.
[00:49:26] Well, maybe I need to check those two guys and maybe I need to get rid of them. But if you've got
[00:49:31] whatever, 20 people that don't understand what they're supposed to be doing, guess what? It's on you.
[00:49:39] We arrive now at the fourth precept, the best union in the organization. Always the one which
[00:49:44] is excellent or better than all things, which is based upon the premise that no unit commander has
[00:49:48] enough time to make his unit superior in all things at all times. How therefore should he spread
[00:49:55] his efforts? It's obvious that his unit must be proficient in marksmanship, communication,
[00:50:00] supply administration, tactics, physical fitness techniques, maintenance, etc, etc, etc.
[00:50:04] If his unit is not proficient in any one of these things, his team is not sound and will fail him
[00:50:10] when the test comes. How then must he manage? So, we got all these things and you obviously can't
[00:50:16] be, and he's making a difference or making a break between superior, which means you're
[00:50:26] awesome at this thing and being good at it. First, he should avoid putting too much stress on any
[00:50:33] one thing, so as to overemphasize it in order to make a show of it. If he practices this method,
[00:50:40] he will do so at the expense of other important things. This is a commoner. So, you shouldn't be the
[00:50:45] master of anything you should be the jack of all trades. Second, he must stress adequately all of the
[00:50:51] many facets of the training job. Even though he is not an expert in each, he must direct a
[00:50:57] subordinate to be an expert and the commander must then supervise and check his subordinate's work.
[00:51:02] The latter is important. So, you're not going to be an expert as the leader, not going to be expert.
[00:51:06] You got some nugs under you that are going to be the expert, nothing.
[00:51:13] Next section is called motivation. Wovement into the entire pattern are the threads of motivation.
[00:51:18] This motivation is manifestly important because it comes from a spree enthusiasm,
[00:51:21] a route, effort, competition, and accomplishment. The people in each of the top middle and lower
[00:51:27] groupings need to be motivated in different ways and in varying degrees, which is a little different
[00:51:32] than when he said earlier, says the leader can only afford to adopt the one approach when
[00:51:35] handling his men. Little, little dichotomy. You got different people that are going to get motivated
[00:51:41] in different ways. In encouraging students to learn, we motivate them by one or more of the following.
[00:51:47] One, show a need to develop and interest both those are explaining why. This is why this is
[00:51:55] important. That's what the need is. Here's how you get someone to develop and interest and
[00:51:58] something you explain to them how it's going to help that. Maintain the interest. That's also
[00:52:04] explaining why. Then he's got some other things encouraging or really success, giving recognition
[00:52:08] and credit, using competition, giving rewards, awarding punishments. These same things
[00:52:13] may be used to incite a body of mentor military unit into action. Undoubtedly, every commander,
[00:52:18] sometime during his career, after being assigned a difficult task, has soon, soon thereafter,
[00:52:24] considered how he would present this task to his subordinates, how he would appeal them to get the
[00:52:28] job done. In short, on what he would base his efforts to motivate them to tackle the job with the
[00:52:36] will necessary to attain the goal sought. He will probably use many factors to motivate his unit.
[00:52:44] Some of them may be specifically mentioned and some may be implied, for instance, except as a
[00:52:49] last resort. He would not mention punishment in this case of failure. His men would know him well enough
[00:52:55] to know that he would not stand for failure. The real art in motivating a group of men to accomplish
[00:53:00] a common mission is to reach each man in such a way that all men in the unit are incited to the extent
[00:53:06] of their several capabilities. Of course, the kind of mission to be performed by the men will be
[00:53:12] will determine the motivating factors used, but there is one element that must be kept in mind.
[00:53:17] And that is that no amount of motivation will incite to man to undertake,
[00:53:23] and that is what he knows is manifestly beyond his capabilities. So big chunk about motivation
[00:53:32] there. I was talking, I can't remember who is the client or if he was the EF online the other
[00:53:38] day. But when you get told the proverbial, you get tasked with something that doesn't make any sense
[00:53:47] and the boss just says, shut up and have your team do it. What do you do? How do you
[00:53:51] handle that? What do you say to the troops? And I'm like, I will find a reason why all day long
[00:53:57] that is awesome. You know, I will go, and I'm not going to go, I don't. I'm going to say, hey, listen,
[00:54:02] boss just told us this is how we're doing it. And you know, we're going to do, we're going to
[00:54:05] knock this thing out of the park. That way, I'm going to build some trust with a boss. He's going to
[00:54:09] realize that we can get the job done. When he realized that we can get the job done, he's going to
[00:54:13] start to listen me. Once he starts to listen to me, I'm going to get this changed. So right now,
[00:54:17] we're going to crush this thing and the guys go, yes, or I'm going to say, hey, look, no,
[00:54:22] I'll just be able to do this. Where the only people that can get this done, the boss knows it.
[00:54:27] We know it. So we're going to knock this thing out of the park. Like, I'm going to figure out a reason
[00:54:32] there's got to be a reason why that makes sense to do this thing. And believe me, if I can't
[00:54:37] find a reason to work it and told to do something that makes no sense whatsoever is going to get
[00:54:42] people unnecessarily gounded or killed or it's unethical or it's immoral or it's illegal. That's what's
[00:54:50] going on. Otherwise, I can figure out a reason. And I'm talking about a good, I'm not talking
[00:54:55] about making something up to trick people. I'm talking about I will figure out a good, freaking
[00:54:59] reason to go forward to make this happen. And that's what you need to do as a boss. That's that's why
[00:55:05] the Y is so important. Talks about awards in the army. We use freely a system of awards and
[00:55:17] prizes in order to motivate men to often these go to the men in the top of the upper group.
[00:55:24] They provide no incentive for improvement to those in the lower group and little for those in the
[00:55:29] middle group because the men know that the award is beyond their ability to achieve these prizes
[00:55:35] make good articles for the unit papers, but they're overall effectively unit is negligible.
[00:55:42] It is well to recognize the outstanding men and we do this through proficiency pay and promotion.
[00:55:50] However, our system awards must go beyond this recognition of individuals. This is a great point.
[00:55:56] You know, so often we're sitting there rewarding the people that are doing well.
[00:56:01] Who actually probably don't need any additional motivation. Look, should we recognize them? Absolutely.
[00:56:07] But what are we doing for the middle group and even the lower group to make sure that they're
[00:56:12] feeling like they're moving forward in a positive way?
[00:56:16] Yeah, you know, when you're like in elementary school and you have like the award for most
[00:56:20] improved, that's like kind of alleviates that issue, right? A little bit.
[00:56:24] Because usually it's like someone in the middle, maybe even the bottom, a lot of the times when you
[00:56:29] still get that cool like trophy or whatever, because you improved so much. Is that right?
[00:56:34] A little backhanded smack though. I guess you rack up some most improved.
[00:56:42] I've gotten every four years. No, I don't think it is though. I don't think it is a backhanded thing
[00:56:48] because it's true. Like, you know, when you get like, you know, MVP of the football game,
[00:56:52] it's always the same guy, the quarterback, whatever the guy in, you know, you obviously depends on
[00:56:58] the game. But it's like, that's why he's already training, by the way. And he's already talented and
[00:57:02] gifted and he's working hard and he's focused. Yeah. And the word, the guys in the middle, you do
[00:57:09] run that risk big time, where it's like the guys in the middle is like, oh yeah, well, I don't even
[00:57:13] have an expectation of the award, you know, but if you get, if you get most improved,
[00:57:19] but you can get most improved. That's good. You know, especially if everyone respects it,
[00:57:23] because everyone typically does respect that if you're improving. I had, there's something called
[00:57:28] the Navy achievement medal. Did you ever get Navy achievement medal? So Navy achievement medal is like,
[00:57:33] you know, it's sort of like, it's a, it's a strong pat on the back. Well, say, and you know,
[00:57:38] you might get one with something happens. You know, you're a young and list of guys. I think I had
[00:57:43] six Navy achievement medals, which is totally ridiculous. I would get those things all the time for
[00:57:47] like, what's it for? Like, oh, I would run a communications course. When these are all from the 90s,
[00:57:53] it'd be like, you know, petty officer willing ran an outstanding, you know, good,
[00:57:57] communications course. He organized, led and developed the Bob of a bot. Nam. Stoner used to
[00:58:01] like laugh every time I put my dress uniform on because I had five Navy achievement medals.
[00:58:06] I'm like the big rack of stars across my Navy across my NAMS. Get some. Yeah. But I
[00:58:14] feel like, I know, but I feel like I was kind of that guy. Like, I was working hard and they were just
[00:58:19] giving me awards and I was like, cool, whatever. I don't care. I didn't care at all. Yeah. I wasn't like,
[00:58:25] check out my NAMS. Well, then, okay, then I guess if you kind of go into it, I mean,
[00:58:31] in all kinds of environments, right? There's all kinds of different awards like that that are
[00:58:35] that are, you can get without being the top like producer, whatever. Like, you got,
[00:58:40] okay, you got most improved, then you got like hardest worker or something like that, you know,
[00:58:44] how you never get that one? No. Okay, I was not a sales. As far as like expectations of metal,
[00:58:49] that one was on in every release. But, but you get those. How many NAMS do you have Dave?
[00:58:55] One. What did you get to them? I got an end of tour NAMS. Dang. So when was this when you were
[00:59:00] like an incident or a, yeah, first tour, yeah, first tour in a squadron. So as you're thinking,
[00:59:07] I was laughing because you know, when you're talking about even the way you're saying NAM like anybody
[00:59:11] in the NAMS, the NAMS is like this thing. This NAMS team of metal is like an irractive five of those.
[00:59:18] Totally. But, you know, it's something that's actually cool that you said is there's a couple
[00:59:24] different ways to view. Like the award system in the military can be a little questionable.
[00:59:28] There's people who can kind of peel that bag and go, man, is that legit or not?
[00:59:32] We had two different categories of the same award. We had what we called an endotur award,
[00:59:36] so, okay, you know, pedagy offshore willink has been with us for three years. He's leaving the
[00:59:40] squad or the unit or whatever and he's going, we want to recognize his body of work.
[00:59:44] It's kind of like a participation award. It doesn't have a ton of meaning other than
[00:59:48] you survived your three years. We want to thank you in your way out. There was something else we
[00:59:52] called was an impact NAMM or we had a term called a strived by NAMM. Oh, we called it a spot NAMS.
[00:59:58] Yeah, same same thing. It was just a spot. Just the same. It's the same thing.
[01:00:01] A crack in a spot. Which means like it was going out of style.
[01:00:03] Oh, there's no way to make this, this, this, make this serious. This five man's.
[01:00:10] The behind behind that is like you can take a middle or the road dude.
[01:00:13] Middle road guy who's, who's not your all-star quarterback, not your top tier guy. And he's
[01:00:17] over there doing some good work. Yes. So maybe that was me. Do you? Yeah, maybe I don't know.
[01:00:22] They were trying to encourage her. Five is a bit ridiculous. I don't have five of anything,
[01:00:28] but there is a way to, to, when you, when you recognize somebody for their work,
[01:00:35] it's a heck of a lot better to recognize them for something they're doing when we call the impact
[01:00:38] or the spot as opposed to, well, you've been with us for five years. You get to watch. Like,
[01:00:44] that's our thing. So here's your, here's your, you've been here for five years as opposed to,
[01:00:48] hey, that thing you did that specific thing. If you could recognize people for that,
[01:00:53] in this leadership little system you're trying to create is, it's really good to recognize
[01:00:57] people for the work that they do when they do it as opposed to, well, we just sort of have this
[01:01:02] process that by these wickets or these little checkpoints you get recognition, which over time
[01:01:07] sort of undermines the value of it. And, and again, five's a, whoa, that's a lot of the name is not it.
[01:01:15] I mean, you're talking about straight up essentially a participation trophy. Like, you, oh, you've been
[01:01:19] here five years. My name was a participation award. I was leaving, captain's got names.
[01:01:25] I don't care if you were the number one captain or the number 12 captain when you left. You got an
[01:01:30] am. And the number one guy, guy didn't go, well, I actually earned this one. And the number 12 guy didn't
[01:01:35] think of this as garbage. It had no real meaning. The impact, what you call it, a spot. The spot
[01:01:41] name. That's a, that's, there's a lot more legitimacy to that than, hey, thanks for being here.
[01:01:47] Do you got to look on your Facebook, like you're all fired up for my names?
[01:01:51] Well, here's the thing, but that's a perfect point right there because if there, if a spot
[01:01:56] name and a regular participation trophy name is the same sort of thing, then it's like, oh, wait,
[01:02:01] you got to differentiate those two because if you're, you're saying you got to five. There is a
[01:02:05] differentiation on the name that is you can get a V, which is when it becomes a combat award. Yeah.
[01:02:10] So a name with a combat V or a combat distinguishing device is what they call it. So it has a V on it.
[01:02:18] And that's, that's a legit award. And I, a lot of guys in tasking a bruiser got names with Vs.
[01:02:24] And those names with Vs that the guys got in tasking a bruiser were hard earned. They weren't like,
[01:02:30] oh, you're just going to, you, there was some gunfire near, but no, like these guys were in 18
[01:02:35] fire fights, and they got a name with the V. And, and you know, the, some of the guys in, in tasking a
[01:02:41] bruiser, some of Stoner's guys, they got the R com, which is the Army Commendation Medal with the V.
[01:02:47] That was a huge deal because those things are tough to get the R. And that came out of those things.
[01:02:52] And that came from the, from the Army recognizing what you were doing, which, which added that,
[01:02:57] which added to that as well. Yeah. There's a couple things in the military have a little bit of
[01:03:01] sanctity. The V, whether it's a name, a com, whatever it is, the V that has, there, there's,
[01:03:07] me, you can't just get a V. You got to earn that combat distinguishing device. The other one of
[01:03:13] them, Rincor that, shouldn't say the Rincor, Navy the Rincor is what we call the car. The
[01:03:17] combat actually ribbon, they don't like to just, you don't just, that's not a participation award.
[01:03:21] You, you got to earn that car. Yeah. And the C.I.B. in the Army, which is the combat
[01:03:26] infantry badge, which means you, you, you, you, you've been in combat. Yes. Yeah. And that's, that's what,
[01:03:32] that's what Hackworth called out, uh, the Admiral for Admiral Borda for wearing a combat V.
[01:03:41] On his name, it was actually, I think it was, it was a name with a V on it. And he, and Hackworth said
[01:03:47] this guy was in Vietnam, but he wasn't using on a ship. He wasn't in direct combat with the,
[01:03:51] and Admiral Borda killed himself. Yeah. Over this drama over it, it's crazy. Now that I'm,
[01:03:56] you know, we're sitting here laughing, you're like, oh, this, we can't never get serious again. All
[01:03:59] we have to do is talk about Admiral Borda and, and, and, and Colonel Hackworth called him out for
[01:04:04] wearing a combat V and he kills himself in the Navy yard. Back to your five Nams. If some of those
[01:04:17] were like, for some solid work you did on this little thing, that you thought maybe wasn't that
[01:04:22] huge of a deal, but you did some good work in people saw what you did and you were like, hey,
[01:04:26] hey, look, you didn't save the world, but you did really good with that little, whatever you did.
[01:04:30] That's different than a participation trophy type situation.
[01:04:33] Prudition. All fired up. I was stoked, you know, I was trying to work hard, trying to do a good job,
[01:04:38] and people were giving me cool recognition, and I appreciated it. I'm just saying that you fast forward it
[01:04:43] from 1995 to like 2009, and we're back from Ramadi, and I'm putting my dress uniform on and
[01:04:53] stone or sees me, and we're laughing, because I have five Nams, which is really, really, really,
[01:04:57] it's also especially ridiculous. I was an officer, and it's like an officer, if you're an officer,
[01:05:01] you got five, I mean Dave Burke, you know, who is in the Marine Corps for 24 years?
[01:05:06] Had one NAMM, and there I was walking around with five. That's kind of, it's just,
[01:05:09] it's not fun to be funny about it. So to the officers and chiefs that gave me recognition as a
[01:05:16] young and listed guy, I appreciated it, it meant a lot to me, but over time it did become a little
[01:05:23] bit funny and a little bit ridiculous that I was walking around with five Nams. I'm going to have to
[01:05:26] now post a picture, I don't think I have any of this stuff anymore, but I realized that I'm
[01:05:30] probably coming off as NAMM obsessed at this point. You are a little bit, but I'm sure they
[01:05:37] end. I'm going to write you up for one. So you ever got to employ you the month at, you know,
[01:05:41] you, I was in the military, my whole life, right? No, you worked at Wendy's. Oh yeah, I was never
[01:05:46] in play the month. Okay, but isn't that the same thing? Employee the month?
[01:05:52] I would rather get a NAMM than employ you the month at Wendy's. But it's the same thing.
[01:05:56] It's just not in the military, you're just saying. It's a similar thing. Nams were harder to get
[01:06:01] that employee the month. There was no guarantee that a NAMM was being issued.
[01:06:04] Right. They got to choose somebody, but still same deal as far as the structure. You seem
[01:06:10] saying where it's like you're getting awarded for something you did even though in your mind,
[01:06:16] it might not be that big of a deal. But as an individual like process, it's kind of a thing.
[01:06:22] It's something. It's just not nothing, you see. We'll go with it. We'll go with it.
[01:06:28] All right, back to the book. Summary and conclusion, the job of those of us who are privileged to
[01:06:33] command to create superior units from the ordinary run of manpower made available to us. This manpower
[01:06:40] falls into upper middle and lower groups about equal and strength that have different capabilities,
[01:06:45] present different problems and need to be handled differently. All of the men in a unit must be
[01:06:50] assumed to desire to do what is wanted and when they do not, they have not been properly handled
[01:06:56] and instructed. And I would add the word led there. The best and most reliable unit is usually
[01:07:03] the one that is excellent in all things, even though it might not be superior in any way.
[01:07:10] So that's the different he breaks out the hierarchy of adjectives, the highest adjective being
[01:07:16] superior and then below that is excellent and excellent is better to be excellent in everything
[01:07:21] than superior and one thing. Throughout the whole job runs the problem of motivation, this problem
[01:07:26] is not solved unless steps are made to motivate the unit carefully thought out and applied in
[01:07:31] such a way that their effect is felt by all men in the unit. Finally, excellence of the unit is measured
[01:07:37] by the extent to which those of the lower third of the unit are developed to play their part
[01:07:42] of the unit team. You know, still 100% on board with that one. As far as I'm concerned,
[01:07:49] motivation is about understanding why you're doing what you're doing and giving people ownership.
[01:07:52] You want to motivate people, tell them why they're doing what they're doing and let them take
[01:07:55] ownership about it and run with it. I feel like motivation is like kind of there's like short
[01:08:03] term in long term and you know like I was thinking of something very specific at the time where
[01:08:09] you know people get mad when they get angry at something that motivates them like super hardcore
[01:08:14] but only short term and then if somebody someone's the opposite if someone's really happy or
[01:08:18] I don't know thankful or whatever that keeps them sort of motivated long term. That's good. I would agree
[01:08:24] that unless they have like some sort of weird underlying fear of something that might sustain them
[01:08:31] long term. Yeah, you could get into some details but I think a broad statement that like some
[01:08:35] kind of an anger would be a short more of a short term motivation and a happiness, a satisfaction,
[01:08:44] a gratification would be more of a long term. I would agree with that. I would tend to agree with that.
[01:08:49] All right, now we're going to get into, um man, I thought those were kind of like, hey we'll
[01:08:54] just burn through some of those chapters. I'm sorry because I wanted to get to this chapter which
[01:08:58] is called chapter 13, Mission Type Order, the problem of control in World War II, those who
[01:09:05] served in armored divisions and probably in other units as well learned that mission type orders were
[01:09:09] requirement if the most was to be obtained from a command. Since then we have had and mission type
[01:09:16] so what mission types orders are just in a nutshell is you tell somebody what needs to happen,
[01:09:21] you let them go for your how to do it. It's very, it's the basis of decentralized command.
[01:09:28] Since then we've had to consider the control of operations in the fluidity and unpredictability
[01:09:35] of nuclear battle. As battle becomes more complex and unpredictable responsibilities must be
[01:09:42] more and more decentralized. Thus mission type orders often will be used at all echelons of command
[01:09:49] and probably will be the rule at the division and higher levels. This will require all commanders
[01:09:55] to exercise initiative, resourcefulness and imagination operating with relative freedom of action.
[01:10:03] And this is what's weird, you know, he he oscillates between these sort of like,
[01:10:07] everyone should be, you know, how do we control the man and he literally says in that earlier chapter
[01:10:12] the the middle group is easier to control and now he's saying hey you need to let them go and operate
[01:10:19] and it's really scary. I thought he was going to start talking about nuclear war. What do you
[01:10:23] think about nuclear war? I think centralized control. I want 17 people to make sure that that is the
[01:10:30] right move before that freaking fire button gets hit and those two keys get simultaneously turned. But
[01:10:38] he's like no decentralized command. That's pretty scary to me. In our tactical, in our tactical
[01:10:46] forces we have built in organizational flexibility. We must recognize this and capitalize it
[01:10:52] in our orders to get maximum combat power. We must have plans flexible enough to meet rapidly
[01:10:58] changing situations. But careful planning is not enough. This must be coupled with the readiness to change
[01:11:05] and adapt the situations as they are not as they are expected to be. Awesome. What's interesting
[01:11:11] about that is he says we need to make plans flexible enough to meet rapidly changing situations.
[01:11:17] And he says, but careful planning is not enough. When I think of careful planning, I think all
[01:11:21] this guy is going to sit there and plan every detail. I don't think of somebody that's thinking,
[01:11:24] hey, we're going to come up with a very flexible plan. A flexible plan to me is not careful planning.
[01:11:30] I guess I might be reading too much into that. But I always felt like I cheated all the time
[01:11:36] because I came up with flexible plans for things. Yeah, it seems like a carefully plan or a
[01:11:44] plan plan carefully is like you carefully carefully plan for contingencies. Yeah, I guess carefully
[01:11:50] plan doesn't necessarily mean to be doesn't need to be overly detailed and fat. Carefully plan
[01:11:55] could be like, hey, we want to be careful that we don't put too much detail in here.
[01:12:01] And then yes, being able to adapt to situations as they are, not as they were expected to be,
[01:12:06] that's a critical way to operate. To train commanders and staff officers for operations in
[01:12:12] war where mission type orders will be widely used. It is necessary that tactical courses in our
[01:12:16] schools teach the use of such orders and that when widely employ mission type orders in our
[01:12:22] peace time operations, I love that. So when you're going to give people assignments to clean up the
[01:12:30] building, you don't say you mop and you scrub and you clean and you go, no, you say,
[01:12:35] how I'm building clean? This is what time it needs to be done by and you let them go execute it.
[01:12:38] Boom, decentralized command mission type order. And think about that. I just kind of blew that
[01:12:47] off, but that's a real thing. Like if you don't train people and you don't live like this,
[01:12:53] then you won't get good at it. You have to actually live like this. This has to be your way of life.
[01:13:00] If the way that you run your day-to-day operations is micro management, how can you expect
[01:13:09] anybody to do anything other than be micro management when you get into a bad situation,
[01:13:13] get into combat situation. Something really solid on EF online that I was exposed to when
[01:13:21] you were like, hey, when you're in a meeting or you're having a meeting or something and everyone's
[01:13:26] there with their pan and paper waiting for you to say something to write stuff down and then we
[01:13:30] start talking and then they start writing stuff down or whatever. It's bad sign. Yeah, it's a bad sign,
[01:13:34] but it even, but it feels good. It feels good. You know, and can do anything unless big job
[01:13:38] man rolls in. But the big ego in the plan. You're really a horrible leader if they're all sitting
[01:13:44] there waiting. Yeah, we got two or three questions. We already know what we're doing. We know what we're
[01:13:49] going. Yeah, we're good. Oh, this is beautiful. Scope of a mission type order. Basically a mission
[01:14:00] type order needs to cover only three important things. One, it should clearly state what the
[01:14:06] commande what the commander issuing the order wants to have accomplished. That's number one. This is
[01:14:12] what this is what you need to accomplish. Number two, it should point out the limiting or control factors
[01:14:17] that must be observed for coordinating factors. So, okay, you can't go across this area. You can't fly
[01:14:25] over this region. You can't enter into this zone. Here's the limitations. And then finally,
[01:14:31] it should delineate the resources made available to the subordinate commander and the support which
[01:14:36] he can't expect or count on from sources outside of his command. That's all you need to know.
[01:14:42] Tell me what to do. Tell me what the limitations are. Tell me what resources I have. Other than that,
[01:14:47] leave me alone. I'm going to go make it happen. That's that might be the clearest definition
[01:14:57] of a mission type order I've ever read in my life. That's all you need. I got asked one time
[01:15:03] I was in my first deployment to Iraq and my boss is like, what information do you need and how
[01:15:10] much time do you need to launch on a mission? It was like, I need to know where the location of the
[01:15:16] target, the frequencies of the friendly forces, and I need 15 minutes and we'll go. Yes.
[01:15:30] Confidence in subordinate commanders, there is a strong reluctance at every headquarters to
[01:15:36] relinquish the authority to direct the details of an operation. This reluctance is clearly seen
[01:15:42] in the embellishments attitude in order as it threads its way down to company level. Careful
[01:15:47] judgment must be made at every echelon of command in stating the limiting and controlling factors
[01:15:52] of a mission type order. Confidence must be placed in judgment and ability of the subordinate
[01:15:57] commander. Too often what starts off as a broad mission type order at the high echelon ends up with
[01:16:03] volumes of my new detailed and restricting instruction specifying how to get the job done when
[01:16:13] it finally gets down to company level. Many officers hearing this may think they would like to have
[01:16:19] a command functioning under such a system. Meaning I would love it if people would just do exactly
[01:16:24] what I told them to do but you don't want that. Others who may say they would like to work under such
[01:16:28] a system really are disturbed by thoughts of it. There are some officers who require something
[01:16:33] in writing before they will take significant action. A mission type order requires the subordinate
[01:16:39] commander and his staff to make basic decisions and plans based upon a careful analysis of the
[01:16:43] situation. If the basic decisions or plans are not successful there is no paper foxhole into which
[01:16:49] they can crawl. Mission type orders require initiative, promptness and resourcefulness which are
[01:16:55] not always forthcoming. Problems in service schools based upon such orders bring forth a variety of
[01:17:02] solutions which are difficult for the faculty to grade. Sometimes looms as a very important problem.
[01:17:10] What do you got? There are so much there. You haven't given this example of just cleaning the building.
[01:17:18] Just that little example of cleaning the building. The worst thing I can do as a leader is to tell
[01:17:24] you how to do that. The minute I tell you how you know what you're going to do exactly what I told
[01:17:30] you. I'm going to say this and this. What are the chances I get it all as a leader? Zero. What
[01:17:38] you're actually going to do is what I told you to do. I'm going to miss a couple of things and
[01:17:42] actually the outcome is not going to be what I want. I'm going to expect him like hey you didn't do this
[01:17:46] and what happens is I trust you less. I'm going to make sure I manage even more which means you
[01:17:50] have even less initiative the next time. The connection from how to initiative and what I wrote down
[01:17:55] was how by me telling you how to do what I want you to do and I'm not saying like teaching you how to
[01:18:00] do something. I'm telling you how I want it done. That's the how you're talking about. Of course,
[01:18:04] I want to teach you how to do a task or a job. I need to train you. He's talking about this is how
[01:18:09] I want you to do this task which is totally different than the exact opposite of initiative.
[01:18:15] Because if I tell you how to do it, you're going to do exactly how I told you to do it.
[01:18:19] And then the things that I've missed, the things that I've committed, I don't know because I'm
[01:18:23] farther away from the problem than you are. I'm going to trust you less because the outcome is
[01:18:28] going to be the one I want. I'm going to micromanage more. I'm going to undermine your initiative
[01:18:30] even more and then when you're out there doing it on your own and I actually can't get to you
[01:18:34] which is the connection from the training to the real world. There's why you have to live this all the
[01:18:37] time. That's when teams and organizations fail because I'm not going to be there to solve this
[01:18:41] problems for you but I've bred this in you the entire time because I'm always telling you how I want you to
[01:18:45] do it and you're like, cool, I'll do exactly how you told me to do it and I'm not going to do this.
[01:18:50] I'm not going to do that. You even know about this over here. I'm just not even touching that because
[01:18:52] you didn't tell me about that at all but if you go the exact opposite which was hey,
[01:18:58] however you want to get this done, that's all good. What we need to get it done is by 1600
[01:19:02] on Wednesday because what happens at 1700 on Wednesday is this and this and in fact,
[01:19:05] all that go make it happen. All of that is your initiative to go make that happen.
[01:19:11] Just the connection between me telling you how I want it done versus your initiative and the
[01:19:17] inverse relationship between those two and how often we see that done wrong.
[01:19:21] That's what you're driving with a micromanager direction, give her. You know driving with you,
[01:19:29] you're just like whatever takes it here, whatever kind of thing and that's a good move. Even if
[01:19:33] I make wrong turns, whatever, you'll help. But what else can you help? And you'll help whatever.
[01:19:38] But you get in, you ever drive with somebody who's like hey, don't be in this lane, this lane is like
[01:19:42] too slow or whatever. And it's like okay, make this turn. It's got like a micromanager, what do you call them?
[01:19:48] Front seat drive, back seat driver, whatever. That kind of person. Let's say it's your
[01:19:53] significant other. I'm not saying it's my significant other. Not my friend. That's not hypothetically.
[01:19:57] Hypothetically. Yes. Someone who you drive with a lot is the same. So in every time it's like,
[01:20:03] hey, you know, we're going to go this route. Hey, get out of this lane, go in this lane. Okay, take this turn.
[01:20:08] You know, okay, it's coming right, you know, like really kind of micromanaging you're driving
[01:20:13] situation. After a while you sort of, you kind of get used to that.
[01:20:18] Yeah. And now of a sudden you're not paying attention. They go, wait, tell you,
[01:20:21] you're supposed to take that turn. You're like, why didn't you tell me that? It's a weird subconscious.
[01:20:24] Why don't you tell me Sarah? Charles. It's a subconscious, almost dependence.
[01:20:32] For sure. That's 100% what it is. That's 100%. That's the initiative comment that I'm the
[01:20:37] connection to. It was like, I'm going to take no initiative because I'm you've been training.
[01:20:41] Yeah. You just wait to be told what to do exactly right. So just like how you're saying where now
[01:20:48] if let's say I'm dependent on you to give me directions, you don't, you know, the leader,
[01:20:53] whatever, he doesn't always get it right or whatever. I make the wrong
[01:20:57] call or you don't give me direction. We'll say you don't give me direction. I take no action. And then,
[01:21:01] of course, it's done wrong. Now you trust me less and now and around and around we go.
[01:21:06] You know, so I'm thinking, and I'm micromanage you more and I stifle even more of your initiative.
[01:21:11] Even more. Exactly right. You know what's crazy about this and Dave V. and I
[01:21:15] were talking about this before we press record is like, I basically think in commanders intent.
[01:21:22] Like I think the way my mind works, I think in end states and everything else to me is just
[01:21:28] sort of this almost like an annoyance of reality. And I'm so far like when I want to do something,
[01:21:36] I'm so there that everything else is just sort of going to fall in the place and I'm not even thinking
[01:21:40] about it. You know, whether it's like when I'm starting to write a book like I know what that book is,
[01:21:45] I know the end state and I want it looks like and now I just have to get those words out of my
[01:21:48] system when we're going to launch something. It's like, I already know what's going to happen.
[01:21:54] Now even if you think about something as stupid as this podcast of me being like echo,
[01:21:59] can you make a podcast and you're like, well, let me go figure it out. You figured out, I'm like,
[01:22:01] I don't even care nothing. I care zero. You show up with what you could have shown up with a with a
[01:22:07] freaking a tape recorder and I would have been like, okay, is that what it sounds good? All right,
[01:22:12] we're good because I know what I know where this is going to go. I know where we're going.
[01:22:16] And so wherever we're going to get there, it's like an annoyance to me and it's an annoyance of
[01:22:22] reality because of where my mind is what I'm thinking about where we're going. And that's a positive
[01:22:29] thing for a couple reasons. Number one, if you're working for me, if you're making stuff happen,
[01:22:34] if you're good, you're good to go. I mean, you can just, you make stuff happen. We're good. We're
[01:22:40] totally good. I'm never going to bother you. Never going to bother you. So that's rad. And then also
[01:22:45] the, the, I'm not going to call up in these details, which means that step that I take is going to be
[01:22:54] a big one. It's going to be a big step. It's not going to be a little, and I'm not going to take half measures.
[01:23:00] Yeah, we're going in the distance. So I'm thinking and acting in kind of living in like
[01:23:05] in a commander's intent kind of way. Yeah, it's not kind of, for those of us that are inside that
[01:23:14] sphere, the byproduct of you is a leader thinking in outcomes and in states. If that's how you're thinking
[01:23:20] and leading your people, the natural reaction of the people around you is to fill in all those things
[01:23:26] to make sure that happens. And if you can take it a step further, if you can take it a step further
[01:23:31] as a leader, and also be comfortable with the other side of it, which is a phrase that you use all the time,
[01:23:37] which I love, which is, you got to expect those things to happen. Then it's no factor if exactly
[01:23:43] how you had this picture in your mind, you got to live these two little, little, little,
[01:23:45] little, little problem here. Yeah, those things are going to happen. And we and we can solve those things,
[01:23:51] too, using the exact same approach, which is if you have that attitude as a leader, when your
[01:23:56] people run into problems, then I'm not going to be pan-extricking about what is the boss going to
[01:24:00] think, because he's going to say, I expect those things happen. Those things are going to happen.
[01:24:03] And I'm going to end up solving that as well. And so if you connect the idea of thinking in
[01:24:08] and states around your people and also letting your people know, you're not going to fly off the handle,
[01:24:13] and jump right in, they're starting to micromanage them when they get these little hiccups,
[01:24:16] these little deviations, because you actually in your mind, Joko, haven't thought about all the things
[01:24:21] that happened between here and here. You're really care was going on in here. Cool, you go off the
[01:24:24] act, cool. I expect those things to happen. But the minute you lay that all out, like all these
[01:24:28] 30 steps to get there and one doesn't go right, and then you're involved in that,
[01:24:33] what that does is stifle your people makes it so much harder for them to get to your
[01:24:37] end state. So just combine the two of thinking in those end states, and then letting your people
[01:24:44] solve those things along the way, and not overreacting to the problems that occur as you're getting
[01:24:48] there, because things are messy. Those things are messy. But by the way, if you're thinking about
[01:24:53] all those things in between, you don't even, you're not even going to think about it. I think about
[01:24:56] the end state. A bigger picture. You're going to be thinking like, hey, we need to move
[01:25:00] to this next ridge on. You're not thinking about where you're going to end up in two days on this
[01:25:05] operation, or we're going to end up strategically in three months. You're like, you're not even thinking
[01:25:09] about that. You're thinking about, wait a second, there's an obstacle right in front of us. What are we
[01:25:12] going to do? And me, well, I'm like, I'm care. I literally don't get as 19 different ways to solve that
[01:25:18] problem. Pick one of them and roll with it. Oh, you, oh, it didn't work. And you got to try again,
[01:25:22] cool. Whatever. I'm still over here. And guess what? I'm looking off in the distance. So we're good.
[01:25:27] That's a good point. And maybe, I don't know, maybe I'm my experience, which is nothing, but in my experience,
[01:25:34] is like under appreciated or whatever, like not flying off the handle and things go wrong.
[01:25:40] Like if you, like, you know, you're like, I can come up with this true though. Like, yeah,
[01:25:46] you know, people have this misconception of you. Like, oh, what if Dr. Guggets
[01:25:50] Maddo you for making this or doing that? The reality is you don't really get mad at mistakes.
[01:25:56] You know, like you might tease me a little bit of whatever. But yeah, like you don't get mad.
[01:26:01] But what that does is, and what I was listening to you did say that and stuff. It made me remember.
[01:26:06] Yeah, that's true. Like, I don't have a fear of making the wrong move if we both know where
[01:26:11] we're sort of going. And guess what? That means you can move. That means you can, you can make two,
[01:26:16] three, four, seven moves. You can make seven moves. And you never had to talk to me.
[01:26:22] And six of them were right. Nine of them were right. 11 out of 12 were right. There was one
[01:26:27] wrong one. It set you back a half a move. And then you press forward and there was no factor.
[01:26:32] If I was concerned that Jocquo is going to get mad at me for, I don't know, what if I make the wrong
[01:26:37] decision on this? Like, should we do this or should I do this or should I not do this or whatever?
[01:26:41] But I'd be like, you're going to keep making this in time. Like, probably it would work way
[01:26:46] work. Yeah, somebody quoted you on Twitter. It was like a great way to not waste your people's
[01:26:51] time is to not make the, to every, not make sure that you're the one that's making all decisions for.
[01:26:56] Not make them rely on you to make those decisions. That's a great way to not waste their time. Yes.
[01:27:01] And the beauty of that is that they're going to get you to where you want to go faster.
[01:27:05] For sure. I think you're right. I don't want that. For sure. All right. So this is how they
[01:27:09] close out the section. This is, once again, this is such a, there's a dichotomy with general
[01:27:13] Clark. And this is part of that dichotomy right now. And he's talked about it before the channel of
[01:27:19] suggestion. I have said many times that a commander has two channels within which to operate.
[01:27:28] He has the channel of command, barking orders and the channel of suggestion. I believe that a good
[01:27:36] commander who has subordinate to our trained and have the confidence to use mission type orders
[01:27:41] can operate almost exclusively using the channel of suggestion,
[01:27:47] preserving the channel of command for for use only when he wants to give special emphasis to an order
[01:27:55] to relieve someone or to take disciplinary action. That's the only time he's talking
[01:28:02] other than that. It's like, well, how do you want to do it? What do you think we should do? The only
[01:28:06] time he's going to bark orders is when he's going to fire someone, which is what relieves means
[01:28:11] by the way, and in the military relieves someone means you're firing them or to give disciplinary
[01:28:16] actions. Every other time, almost exclusively, it's channel of suggestion. You just made the leap
[01:28:23] by saying it was in my hand as when I'm hearing suggestion. I'm not even hearing suggestion. I'm
[01:28:27] hearing questions. Hey, what do you think? How do you think which isn't even what is that
[01:28:31] in saying in word? Because suggestion means like, hey, what maybe we should do this, you're taking
[01:28:35] it a step further, which is how do you think we should do this? And then the flip side is who is
[01:28:40] that the hammer of, you know, as a commander, you have that hammer. You can drop that hammer.
[01:28:44] I can fire somebody. I can relieve somebody. I could reduce their rank. I could take their pay.
[01:28:49] There was a lot of authority in command. How often do you want to pull out that hammer? Man,
[01:28:56] the more, you know, you just pulled out the big, the big hammer, right? What about the little hammer?
[01:29:02] If the little hammer is even worse, the little hammer of like, actually Dave, we need to do it this way.
[01:29:07] Smack. Little, you know, actually Dave, I don't like your idea. Smack. And meanwhile,
[01:29:11] you're getting all dinged up. And now you don't want to make any moves anymore. The suggestion is,
[01:29:17] is, is actually question. How should we do this? Yeah. Channel of suggestion. Here's the final
[01:29:24] little section. And this is, I briefed you earlier, Dave, I said, there's going to be some moment
[01:29:28] to read that you're going to say yes. So this is that section, further the mission of the higher
[01:29:34] headquarters. I went to Levinworth and people think of Levinworth, they think of going to prison
[01:29:39] because there is a military prison there, but there's also the war college. I went to Levinworth
[01:29:43] over 20 years ago. So it is difficult for me to remember all the things which I must have learned
[01:29:47] then at the command in general staff college. The one thing that I have never forgotten and which
[01:29:52] is stood me in good stead was the teaching of general McNair, then common don when he stated,
[01:30:00] quote, when you receive an order or a directive from your next to higher commander, do everything
[01:30:08] you can and in the best way you can to further the mission which he wants to accomplish.
[01:30:17] And quote, and officer who follows his advice and uses it to interpret his instructions will find
[01:30:24] that he can act wisely properly and aggressively with confidence, he will have no problem in operating
[01:30:28] in an environment with mission type orders. So when your boss tells you to do something,
[01:30:34] freaking do it and do it to the best here ability. Leadership strategy and tactics.
[01:30:42] I always have to go to this page, but it's the things that says how to succeed is a new leader.
[01:30:48] Page 157 and then on page 158, it says lastly get the job done. Get the job done. That's what
[01:30:56] you're supposed to do. And that's what he's talking about. When you get told to do something,
[01:31:00] do it. People talk to me and how do I build a good relationship with my boss? Do the job
[01:31:04] and do it well. Kick ass. Give your boss credit. You'll start building a good relationship with him.
[01:31:17] Chapter 14. Organization for performing tasks on the company in small unit level. The purpose of
[01:31:22] this chapter is set forth a concept of which I've found from experience improves training,
[01:31:27] uses time devoted to training more efficiently and increases responsibility prestige and
[01:31:32] morale of the non-commissioned officer, leader and platoon leader.
[01:31:41] Organization, use organizational units or teams even for work details. I'm not going to read this
[01:31:47] section, but what he says, we're using this example today of cleaning the building. What he's saying is
[01:31:53] when you clean the building, do it as a platoon. So use mission type orders and then do it as a platoon.
[01:31:58] And that just helps them get used to how operating together, what people are like, what it's
[01:32:05] like for that leader, what how that leader relates to the troops, how the troops relate back
[01:32:10] to the leader, you train, how you operate, you work, how you train. And then there's the last
[01:32:19] section in this part is let the leader lead his men, which is the same thing. Under the detail
[01:32:24] procedure of performing necessary unit tasks, all training teams are represented at all scheduled
[01:32:30] training. This may make a good showing in their training accomplished records, but does not necessarily
[01:32:36] mean that they have actually received as teams the training that is shown on record. However,
[01:32:41] maintaining unit integrity while performing daily tasks will also enhance real benefits,
[01:32:49] which we derive from our team training. So every day you should live, you should operate,
[01:32:57] the way you are going to live and operate.
[01:33:04] Chapter 15, wasting soldiers' time. The value of time. We Americans have always been conscious of the
[01:33:10] value of time, Benjamin Franklin expressed this by saying that time is money. In our country,
[01:33:14] the efficiency expert who comes into examine ways of doing things to eliminate wasted
[01:33:19] motion is highly paid for his services. He commands that high price because he is a saver of time.
[01:33:27] In the army, we speak of resources in terms of the three M's. Men, money, and materials.
[01:33:34] To these three, we must add time. However, there's a distinct difference between time and the
[01:33:39] other three resources. If we do not use our money or materials today, they are available tomorrow.
[01:33:45] To a lesser degree, this is also true of men. It is not at all true of time. For the time,
[01:33:51] it is a highly perishable commodity. An hour loss today is lost forever.
[01:33:58] Echo Charles. That's true. I feel like he's training a lot of soldiers today, I'm certain.
[01:34:07] It costs several thousand dollars a year to maintain each soldier in the army. I consider
[01:34:10] that it is probably a cost of five dollars per hour per man for the soldiers training time.
[01:34:14] That is available to the company commander. Thus, when the commander weighs an hour of his company's
[01:34:19] time, he may be wasting as much as a thousand dollars. We would not want to be embarrassed if some
[01:34:26] age to see key became interested in investigating this in the field. That's an interesting way to think
[01:34:29] about. Think about, you know, company is 150 men. But think about your company. Think about your
[01:34:35] business. Think about your team. You got people sitting and you want prepared for the meeting or
[01:34:41] the meeting starts late or whatever. Whatever it is. Think about what you're throwing away.
[01:34:45] You're wasting people's time. We are engaged in a contest with the communists in which there
[01:34:54] is no civil matters in which no civil metal will be awarded for second place. I'm certain that
[01:35:00] it is unnecessary for me to dwell on the importance of the role of the US Army in this contest.
[01:35:04] Our mission is to become about ready to my way of thinking combat readiness has no upper limit.
[01:35:13] A unit is never 100% combat ready because there is always room for improvement in the
[01:35:18] development of military skills. Reaction time, marksmanship and the like combat readiness is a
[01:35:23] gold toward which we are constantly moving, but which we should never feel we have wholly achieved.
[01:35:29] Our progress will depend on our use of the resources which I mentioned previously.
[01:35:34] I want to stress the importance of using time wisely.
[01:35:40] And then he goes through a bunch of how we waste time, time is wasted in administration and paper
[01:35:46] work and red tape. And he says this, you should consider it unforgivable.
[01:35:57] You should consider it unforgivable to remove a man from a scheduled formal period of instruction
[01:36:02] or practical work to take care of administrative matters. You cannot requisition a replacement for
[01:36:09] a lost hour of training. He also says here, we waste time when we overcome it are units.
[01:36:18] Or perhaps I should say we do not make the best use of our time. That's something we got to
[01:36:23] pay attention to on an individual level. You over schedule yourself and you actually add up wasting time.
[01:36:28] Here. The same wastage is presented on the individual level when the strength of a unit is
[01:36:34] filtered away to participate in contest of non-military skills to paint rocks or plant flower beds
[01:36:42] in a likeness of the units insignia. That's a shot right there. You go around military
[01:36:49] paces in America. There's some painted rocks out there, people. There's some white painted rocks
[01:36:53] that align in some roads. And I'm going to tell you, some private painted those rocks. They probably
[01:36:58] got in trouble. It's a little bit of a punitive measure. Oh, like punch. Yeah.
[01:37:09] It is training activities themselves which have the greatest potential for wasting a soldier's
[01:37:13] time. This comes about mainly because of ina-enatic with planning lack of foresight and lack of
[01:37:19] preparedness. Soldiers expect to be well trained. They feel short-changed if they're not.
[01:37:24] If you're in charge of training people, which if you're in a leadership you are,
[01:37:27] position you are in charge of training people and you're wasting your time. You are completely wrong.
[01:37:32] Here's another section. I got a read read. What are the instructions clear?
[01:37:38] There is no end of time wasted when one who is to perform a mission or job is not fully and clearly
[01:37:44] instructed. The instructions are misunderstood. The end result is not what was desired.
[01:37:50] It must be done over. In fact, if things go wrong, the leader, in fact, when things go wrong,
[01:37:57] the leader should check first to see if his instructions were not the cause.
[01:38:02] It is said that general Grant assigned his adjutant the mentally slowest officer he could find.
[01:38:10] Grant read his orders to his adjutant and if the adjutant could not understand, grant
[01:38:17] rewarded his orders until he could. Ask yourself, are your instructions and orders so clear
[01:38:25] that every man, underlined every, doesn't underline much near every man in your unit, can
[01:38:31] understand them. When you issue orders, you are instructing someone. Remember that as an instructor,
[01:38:38] you only teach when someone learns. That's the, I always tell that started with the lowest
[01:38:48] common denominator, right? It's matter of fact, it's in, I think it's in dichotomy.
[01:38:54] Well, hey, lay for safe. I'm telling them, hey, I want you to brief to the lowest
[01:38:59] con-common denominator in the platoon. Whoever you think is going to have the hardest time,
[01:39:04] brief to your machine gunners, your new guy machine gunners, I want them to fully understand the plan.
[01:39:15] I mean, that is the entire second law of combat brief. Almost verbatim that he just described
[01:39:21] about the plan that's understandable the way he communicated and then to the lowest common denominator
[01:39:25] and then to me in my mind that actually comes back to the common he made earlier, which was
[01:39:30] the effort you got to expand from your lowest people in the bottom of your folks to
[01:39:37] for them to understand that that comedy made before by devoting time to that, that's the time
[01:39:41] he's talking about. So it takes his adjutant who he considers to be of the lowest intellectual
[01:39:46] level, his bottom third guy. And I'll spend as much time as I need until that guy gets it.
[01:39:52] And if he gets it, they're good to go. And so even pulling that together, that common made. I mean,
[01:39:58] that is that is simple right there. So good. Do you fully, this is the last section here,
[01:40:07] do you fully utilize your soldiers' time? I am not optimistic as to believe that we can eliminate
[01:40:12] wasting of time as we have yellow fever, but we can improve our performance in this regard.
[01:40:16] We can control this problem by the exercise of sound leadership techniques among which are
[01:40:20] planning good job management issuance of clear instructions and thorough follow-up. The most
[01:40:25] valuable resource available to a commander in the army is the soldier's time.
[01:40:31] As leaders, we must use this resource to the best advantage. I know of no better reputation for an
[01:40:38] officer or non-commissioned officer to have with his men, then that he is a good manager and does
[01:40:43] not waste his soldier's time. If he has that reputation, he will probably not waste his men's
[01:40:49] lives and badly there. That's powerful. I've been doing a lot of talking about leadership capital,
[01:40:55] on the F-Online. In fact, I've been going kind of a Zerak talking about leadership capital on the
[01:40:59] F-Online. And I've been talking about how to build leadership capital, how to lose leadership capital.
[01:41:03] And this is one that I haven't mentioned yet. And it's probably one, it's probably a little bit
[01:41:08] of a blind spot to me because I am a free coin it comes to time and wasting time. And so it's one
[01:41:14] of those things where I would, it's so important to me that I've never, I've never walked into a meeting
[01:41:20] two hours late to have a bunch of people waiting around for me to show up. Like, that doesn't,
[01:41:24] that's not happening. But if you want to expend leadership capital unnecessarily and lots of it,
[01:41:31] make people wait around for you, make them waste time. The phrase being late is unacceptable.
[01:41:41] The reason it's unacceptable is because it's waste peoples' time. You could be the best pilot in
[01:41:49] the squadron. And if you waste peoples' time, you're going to lose leadership capital. You could
[01:41:56] be an average pilot. And if your reputation is that you don't waste people's time, they don't care
[01:42:03] if you're an average pilot. Your leadership capital is directly correlated to how you treat them
[01:42:12] and how you respect them and how you respect their time. Time wasted was always the, it was always
[01:42:19] the most frustrating and the most obvious thing that would happen. I think I've said this on the podcast
[01:42:22] before. Everybody who's had their time wasted by someone else knows exactly what that feels like.
[01:42:27] You can think about it right now, sitting around in the auditorium, sitting around whatever this,
[01:42:31] that time of yours that's being wasted because of somebody else. I don't care how good that
[01:42:36] somebody else is at their job, their task or anything else. If they are at time,
[01:42:39] a wester, you're losing leadership capital. Let me ask you this about being late.
[01:42:45] Oh, man, here we go. It's time to be. I need your opinion on what if it's, let's say,
[01:42:51] Halloween party and they're like, hey Halloween party, you know, there's going to be, I don't know,
[01:42:56] 100 people. There's a lot of people who are fashionably late scenario. You're getting to,
[01:43:00] or what have you. You know, so there's 100 people invited or whatever, 100 plus because
[01:43:07] bring who you want it. It's not like a guest list. You're not invited. It's not that. It's just
[01:43:11] we're having a party, whatever. And starts at, I don't know, wasting time. How long is this going to take?
[01:43:17] Speaking, all right, it starts at five. Okay. Say, five p.m. Okay.
[01:43:22] Goes all night. I don't know. Whatever. And you're like, all right, and you get there. It's
[01:43:28] 630. Other people are there. But you get there at 630. Is that what you see people say? Is that bad?
[01:43:35] It's for a game late. If I send you an invitation to my Halloween party. And I say, the party starts at five
[01:43:40] and goes till midnight. I don't care when you show up. If I say echo be there by seven and you show up at
[01:43:49] 730. Is there a difference between those two? I think so. Yes. Yeah. But yeah, so my questions
[01:43:56] more about that first scenario, whatever. Like if it's like, hey, the party starts at five.
[01:44:00] Yeah, I was going to say the party starts with or without you. Yeah, I'm super concerned about you.
[01:44:04] Yeah. Nobody's sitting around waiting for you to get. But the contrary, the podcast starts when
[01:44:11] you're here. So when you're not here, the podcast doesn't start. You're the ones with the SD
[01:44:18] memory cards that go in the little machines over there. So when you're not here at three o'clock,
[01:44:24] the party's not starting. We're waiting. Understand. You're of your talking like it's for real.
[01:44:30] I was here at 258. What up? You made it in. Yeah. It was legit today. As much as hassle I give you about
[01:44:35] Hawaii and time and being late. You're not late. Very often. Do you play with fire? Yes,
[01:44:43] yeah, every day. I think. And technically a lot of times there's a minute, maybe if you set
[01:44:48] you were one of those people, if you set your watch like five minutes fast, you probably be on time all the time.
[01:44:52] Yeah, if I believe it or if I didn't know, is it the what? Yeah, I've done that before too. Well,
[01:44:57] Ian, how are you to tell you like, oh, I come from a long line of late people.
[01:45:00] There, my words. I'm from my dad. He's so very cracked up because I said, like, you got your
[01:45:07] DNA. You said you got your 23 and me. I said it came back. You got the
[01:45:13] old genius. Yeah, sir. But, and you know, you kind of look into it all like, why am I late or
[01:45:20] whatever. So I would go to work late when I used to work at the cloud. I would be there late.
[01:45:25] I was there late one minute two minutes. Five minutes sometimes probably more time than I was on time.
[01:45:30] Probably for real. I'm not finding this hard to believe. It doesn't seem like a stretch.
[01:45:35] And the thing is technically you are right. Like I'm wasting people's time. Especially if
[01:45:39] if people depend on me to get there at that time. You know, I'm not getting paid. You know,
[01:45:44] it's the kind you got to clock in. So you're not getting paid if you're not there. So it's not that.
[01:45:48] It's like if you were depending on you to be there. But is there like a briefing to start the night?
[01:45:53] No, no, you didn't start. It's like clock in and you're there. I mean, it would piss me off.
[01:45:57] You know, yeah, I do. It's the most un reliable person that I put no value in as a human.
[01:46:04] Thank you. And I did it. But, so I analyzed like, why am I like that?
[01:46:12] Because even if I'm like, I need to be late less. You know, just wouldn't change. Why am I like?
[01:46:16] And you should change the statement. I need to be late less. Do I not going to be late?
[01:46:20] Yeah. But draw a little bit of a harder line in the sand. I understand. And your right.
[01:46:26] My problem is you're right. The thing is you're right. But when I when I really be truthful,
[01:46:30] it's because I don't care about what's going on there. You know, like why am I going to
[01:46:35] prepare like take 30 minutes to prepare this and prepare that for something that I don't have to be there
[01:46:41] at that. I have to be there at a certain time. So of course I'm running the risk. If I did, if I would
[01:46:45] have my way, I would never be late at all. But I would never be early at all either. For things I
[01:46:50] don't care about, you know, like like that. I had one time in my life when I was going to college
[01:46:56] at and it was really hard to get parking. And eventually I figured out a system. But I had a
[01:47:03] seal buddy that he was going to college tune. We would study together. And we are but we were both
[01:47:08] on time all the time for everything. And eventually we made a deal where we gave ourselves like a
[01:47:14] waiver to be five minutes or eight minutes late because if you were going to be there at two
[01:47:20] o'clock in order to be there at two o'clock, you had to show up at one and drive or and so we were
[01:47:25] just like, you know what? Hey, if you're five minutes late, 10 minutes late doesn't matter. Like I don't care.
[01:47:29] I don't want you being here an hour early so that you're not one minute late. So we made a little
[01:47:35] packed and just said, hey, bro, I'll be there between one and one fifteen boom, all good. And I
[01:47:41] try and get there and one and maybe I get there at one o'clock, maybe he get there at one twelve or
[01:47:44] whatever. Eventually I figured out I would just put my bike in the back of the car and just
[01:47:50] park at the top of the hill and just bike no factor. Yeah, see you now here. So you're going to
[01:47:54] solve these problems. So on the flip side and this is all in the spirit of getting down to the whole
[01:47:59] late thing because I agree with you at the end of the day and if you think if you really be honest,
[01:48:03] like I'm not late, really, you know, anymore. Back in my day, for a whole late. Yeah.
[01:48:10] So what are you trying to think of when I was late? No, you were late a little bit the beginning,
[01:48:15] but then, but then like I didn't, I probably remember you being late three times total. Yeah.
[01:48:20] And this is not including a four minute grace period. Which sometimes I think you do just to
[01:48:27] just to, you know, what do you mean grace period? You know, like sometimes if you're supposed to
[01:48:31] be here at one, you're here at one o'clock. Yeah. Four minutes late. It's possible. Yeah, the late
[01:48:36] times I'll tell you, hey, I'm late because of this specific reason or whatever, but that's already,
[01:48:40] but nonetheless, like that is I agree with you where you're wasting other people's time people are
[01:48:45] waiting for you like that's it's it's kind of inexcusable in a way. But if you show up 15 minutes early,
[01:48:54] aren't you wasting your own time a little bit? No, because what are you going to do when you get there?
[01:49:00] You're going to prep. Yeah, well that depends. Yes, depends on me. All right. Sun Siu told us 2,500
[01:49:06] years ago that the one that shows up the battlefield first wins. Yeah, you know, as far as battlefields
[01:49:11] go for sure. But certain circumstances, if you're there, let's say, okay, yeah, I'm going to meet you
[01:49:19] for brunch. You know what's in my bag right now? Well, I could prep the next book I'm reading on the podcast.
[01:49:25] When I show up here early, if there's no one here, cool, I get to read. I get to get ahead.
[01:49:29] Oh yeah, okay, so that's a good point. Okay. Yes. Question answered because yeah, if you show up fit and you
[01:49:34] got to be thinking I guess at the end of the day. So if you show up 15 minutes early, you're not wasting
[01:49:41] your time because you can still choose what to do. You're not forced to wait around for not waiting.
[01:49:47] Yeah. You should be proactive. We're making something happen. Yeah, and you have that option.
[01:49:51] I mean, technically, I guess if you're waiting for someone you have that option, but like to be
[01:49:54] there putting you in that position, rather than you making the decision, putting yourself in
[01:49:58] that position potentially. I understand. Back to the book, chapter 16. So I was super fired up when
[01:50:07] I read this chapter title and then beyond so the guy got a little less fired. I got into it. But
[01:50:13] because the chapter is will you wait for it or will you go get it? It's a whole day. This is the
[01:50:22] chapter I've been waiting for. But what he's talking about is information. I'm so fired up for
[01:50:29] gathering information and are you going to wait for information to come to you or you're going to
[01:50:32] go get it? I'm still I'm so fired up about it, but I'm not as fired up as I was. It's just like
[01:50:36] which is going to make things happen. But he goes in here. There's more than one school of
[01:50:43] fought concerning how a commander can acquire reliable information. One school contains it to
[01:50:49] command or should analyze reports that come to him from his subordinate units and staff. The other
[01:50:53] advocates at the commander should go see for himself yet another endorses a combination of these methods.
[01:51:00] As a commander from company to army group and an as a observer of others holding such
[01:51:05] positions in three wars, let's get a few a little bit cool the right. I have come to certain conclusions
[01:51:13] myself. Moreover, since my retirement from the army, I have worked as a consultant to research
[01:51:18] organizations, baking studies of command control and communication problems for the army,
[01:51:22] the result of this active and retired experience might be helpful to students and practitioners
[01:51:27] who should who would like to excel in the art and techniques of command or ship in general ship.
[01:51:33] And then he goes here looking back, it seems to me more than ever that my best information on both
[01:51:39] our own forces and the enemies was obtained by visiting or observing subordinate commanders.
[01:51:47] There you go, I guess he's saying go get it. This is done either by Jeep or fixed wing airplane,
[01:51:53] borrowed from the artillery, small radius. He goes on. He says this.
[01:52:00] As a core commander in Korea with five divisions on the line, I often left my headquarters by
[01:52:06] chopter by chopper after morning staff briefing and I visited the five division headquarters
[01:52:10] in turn from left to right. The divisions knew when I was coming, the division commanders were told
[01:52:14] that they need not wait for me and that I would talk to the chiefs of staff over a cup of coffee.
[01:52:20] We discussed the latest situations. Then we discussed the problems which had been presented
[01:52:25] by them on a previous day. Then I noted what they wanted my core headquarters to do to help them.
[01:52:32] So that's all good. He's gathering information. And then he says, I told them the situation of the
[01:52:37] 8th Army and of the I Corps as I knew it. Not only is he out there receiving information, he is
[01:52:44] telling them what is going on. He ends up saying that he did that. It's funny. I was reading this
[01:52:54] and he says, generally the next day repeated this as a result. I was not only the core commander,
[01:53:00] but the core commander liaison officer and to a large extent the core communicator with the lower units.
[01:53:05] And I put in parentheses when I was reading this, it was a static war because at this point
[01:53:10] Korea, it was almost trench warfare like they weren't moving. And then what's interesting,
[01:53:16] fast-forwardal would be says, this was an astatic situation, but such command techniques are not
[01:53:21] unusual and mobile warfare. So get out there, get that information. He's got this section in here.
[01:53:32] History is full of instances where the commander being at the critical point at the critical time
[01:53:36] turned the tide of battle to victory or conversely the commander not being on scene. His force was
[01:53:42] defeated. A few such examples have been related so dramatically as in the poem shared and dried
[01:53:48] by Thomas Buchan and Reed. So we're talking civil war. We're talking general Philip Sheridan,
[01:53:55] union general who was five foot five. We're talking about height a little bit earlier.
[01:54:02] Well, he was known as Little Phil. Also known as fighting Phil and the battle of Cedar Creek
[01:54:08] October 19th, 1864s when this went down. One will recall that early in the morning. Sheridan was
[01:54:14] at Winchester, Virginia 20 miles away from his command when news of a new battle arrived.
[01:54:21] He mounted his horse and took off at full speed for the field of combat. Reed's stirring
[01:54:27] verse traces Sheridan's progress through five standards, stands as giving equal credit to both
[01:54:32] him and his horse. The six stands are shows what happens when the commander arrives at the critical
[01:54:37] point of battle and at a critical time. Quote, the first, the general saw were the groups of
[01:54:45] stragglers and then the retreating troops. What was done? What to do? A glance told him both.
[01:54:52] Then striking his spurs with a terrible oath. He dashed down the line, mid-a storm of
[01:54:59] Hazaz, which I had to look up. That's an old form of hooray. So the people started, ah!
[01:55:06] The wave of retreat checked its course there because the site of the master compiled it to pause.
[01:55:16] So there you go. The commander shows up on the battlefield and he turns this retreat into an
[01:55:22] advance and they ended up kind of smashing the Confederates in that battle. It is inconceivable
[01:55:28] that the same result could have been attained on an automated battle field.
[01:55:32] Nor could Sheridan have been brought. Could have Nor could Sheridan have brought order out of chaos
[01:55:41] while seated before a display panel 20 miles away. You need to get there.
[01:55:46] Need to get there. Then he talks about why commanders should be forward.
[01:55:56] He talks about the computer stuff and again he's right and this originally came out.
[01:56:02] I think in 1963 and then this version was 1973. So he's talking about computers.
[01:56:10] So God only knows what that consisted of in 1973, like a mobile command computer.
[01:56:17] We need to get a, I need to do some research on that one. He says these are fine until
[01:56:22] disorderly and confusing conditions that occur so often in battle materialized.
[01:56:27] They do not realize the roles of judgment. So he's talking about all these computations and these
[01:56:32] things that they set up and he said once those are cool and everything's cool. But then once
[01:56:37] the mayhem happens, they do not realize the roles of the judgment and experience factors which
[01:56:42] must be used in handling tactical battle reports. Inevitably, these lead to a working principle
[01:56:49] such as and so here's what the commanders are using to judge their information when they're using
[01:56:55] the computer based data. Discount by 50% all very favorable or unfavorable operational reports
[01:57:02] which come into your headquarters from your subordinate units and then question the remainder.
[01:57:07] So it's basically like this just junk. It's just junk. And then he talks about the helicopter
[01:57:16] and using that to stay forward, which is effective as well. He's got this whole, this whole chapter
[01:57:22] ADP and war will it work. It's automatic and data processing. So we're not going to cover much of
[01:57:33] this and he sets up this sort of hypothetical situation where he starts asking a bunch of
[01:57:37] questions about how well this ADP, how well it's going to work to use ADP during war. And a lot of this
[01:57:45] you know he's talking he's literally talking about like are there going to be power sources
[01:57:49] available. So it's really kind of nitty gritty stuff. But then he says I would not be honest with you
[01:57:55] if I did not point out that commanders at all echelons are apprehensive of the tendency to use ADP
[01:58:02] to facilitate centralization of command and control. I can foresee disastrous effects from indiscriminate
[01:58:09] from indiscriminate centralization or over centralization and loss of flexibility in modern
[01:58:16] fluid war. Why is that? Because now all of a sudden the leader can track everything that everyone's
[01:58:22] doing. Hey, like Dave's in his aircraft and he's like wait a second go a little bit further
[01:58:25] to the right go a little bit further to the left. We know exactly where you are. Wait don't drop the bomb
[01:58:29] yet. Okay drop it now and we're trying to micro manage. Will ADP cause the commander to be more
[01:58:37] command post bound and thus reduces ability to be at critical points at critical times?
[01:58:42] Well, it's a tentative up in a yes with its increased speed and capacity for information. Will ADP
[01:58:49] in the hands of staff officers or of higher headquarters tend to encourage them to put increased
[01:58:56] burden of reporting on lower echelons who are often busily engaged in the vital conduct of battle.
[01:59:02] How crazy is that, Dave? It's not picturing what I saw from the top and the command center,
[01:59:09] you know picturing this being 19 was 76. We said yes the answer to that question is yes it will.
[01:59:16] Yeah so that's what happened in the military. All of a sudden we have the ability to get information
[01:59:19] so we're going to reply to the information. We're going to want more of it and you're going to
[01:59:23] demand it at a time that is totally incompatible with when they should be giving it the information.
[01:59:28] You want to know what's going on? Yeah. Well the reason you don't know what's going on is
[01:59:31] I'm in the middle of doing something right now. Yeah. The god of little situation I'm trying to handle.
[01:59:35] Yeah. Yeah so that's how he explains the whole ADP thing.
[01:59:46] Chapter 18 making progress and improving a military organization. It is the aim of anyone who's
[01:59:50] privileged to come in a company, batay and brigade or division to leave in it is to leave it in
[01:59:54] much better shape than he found it and to be sure his superior's recognized that fact.
[02:00:00] And he goes through this little plossess method which he's gone through before when he
[02:00:05] earlier podcasts, which you're going to make little incremental changes to get better.
[02:00:11] He goes over this section about protecting your image as a commander. A word about headlines,
[02:00:16] most commanders who have sought headlines to establish their image and I'm using those,
[02:00:20] those are, he's putting those in quotes. In the minds of their men and their
[02:00:25] peers have sooner or later have been plagued by unfavorable headlines. Produce a superior,
[02:00:31] well-rounded in solid unit and your image as a commander will be secure as will your military future.
[02:00:40] And then this is the, this is the last thing that we are going to cover. I think.
[02:00:47] Well no it's not, not clear to you that. Yeah this. All right so chapter 19
[02:00:53] techniques of troop orientation and informed education. One of the most important duties of
[02:00:59] a commander is to keep his troops informed and oriented. This is done in many different ways
[02:01:04] with varying degrees of effectiveness. A technique I found very effective was to inform an
[02:01:10] orient by posters and personal visits. So he's talking about posters literally posters that you
[02:01:15] hang on the wall. And this is why when you were talking about simplicity earlier Dave,
[02:01:20] this is this is kind of knocking out of the park. And when I said earlier on this podcast,
[02:01:25] when I was giving him a grade of a D minus for his simplicity of language and his opening,
[02:01:31] he makes up for it here with these posters. In 1956 I took command of the 7th US Army
[02:01:39] in Europe at a time when the relationship of the troops with their German neighbors was at a low
[02:01:44] ab due to a number of things. I think this is also when hack worth was working for him.
[02:01:48] After studying the situation, I concluded that the transition from an army of occupation to
[02:01:54] the status of a guest army in a host nation had not been accomplished. So there's the wrong culture.
[02:02:00] There's the wrong culture from from occupation status to like host to a guest to a host nation.
[02:02:08] This is in Germany. So we went in there, we're occupying force. These were our enemies and now
[02:02:12] we're saying, all right, that's not the deal anymore. Now they're the host nation and we're the
[02:02:17] guest. So he can you imagine trying to shift that culture? That's a tough culture shift.
[02:02:22] I said out to bring about this transition not only for the soldiers, but for the dependence and
[02:02:27] US civilian employees in Germany and so he comes up with this poster that the poster is called
[02:02:33] soldier. And the soldier, the poster just has this picture of a soldier who looks badass
[02:02:39] and it says soldier, this is why you're in Germany. And it's got bullet points to play your
[02:02:49] part on the NATO team to help maintain peace by being constantly combat ready to be a good
[02:02:56] neighbor to our German neighbors to fight if necessary for the rights of free men in the world.
[02:03:03] Simplicity score. Dave, what are you giving him? That's a significant improvement over the
[02:03:11] year. The most improved. Most improved award. So very obvious. So that's what he did. He made this
[02:03:19] poster and and then he did these visits. He did these visits where he would take the troops and
[02:03:28] send them to check out what was happening at the Berlin wall. So it's another way to make people
[02:03:36] understand why. And not only would he send the troops, but he would if he could send the dependence
[02:03:42] there as well. So they understood why. You go see the Berlin wall and then he made and this is the
[02:03:47] last thing we're going to cover again. He's making this so simple and so clear. So along with
[02:03:54] that campaign to get people to see the wall to understand what the purpose of being there was to
[02:04:00] understand why we were there. He made this poster. There's a couple pictures of the wall and it says why
[02:04:08] and it says have you ever wondered why must the communists build walls and fences to keep people
[02:04:17] from fleeing the land where they were born? Why must they charge their fences with electricity
[02:04:25] which can kill people who try to escape? Why armed guards along these walls and fences shoot
[02:04:33] and kill their own people who try to escape from their homes? Why despite these walls and fences
[02:04:42] and guns have over 4 million people left their homes, property and friends and risk their lives
[02:04:49] to escape in the past 15 years? Why the communists surround themselves with walls and fences when
[02:04:58] history shows that this has often been the first step in the self destruction of an empire?
[02:05:05] Then he says why were these affectives? These posters and Operation Luxe which was actually
[02:05:14] traveling to the Berlin Wall were effective because they used the most efficient techniques of
[02:05:20] of informing and orienting the soldier and of having his commander tell him in basic and simple terms
[02:05:29] about situations which are close to him and affect or could affect him personally. He gets it
[02:05:38] across as simply as possible. So there you go. That wraps up our review of guidelines for the leader
[02:05:49] and commander. I have initiated the publication through Jockel Publishing of this book. We are
[02:05:55] reaching out to try and figure out what needs to happen there but it's underway. Bozac has it for action.
[02:06:04] So we'll get it out. We'll get it published. I'm sure that we will continue to refer to it.
[02:06:10] There's so many good lessons here. Even that last lesson that these posters were effective
[02:06:17] because they used the most simple terms to explain to the soldiers why they were doing what they're
[02:06:25] doing. Something that I've been talking about for 20 years explaining people why they're doing
[02:06:29] what they're doing and that is such an off that's such a such a response. We use all the time at
[02:06:34] S.L.M. front all the time. My people aren't doing this. My people don't want to get on board
[02:06:40] that tell them why they're doing what they're doing. Explain it to them in terms that they can
[02:06:45] understand. That's what he did. That's what he's telling us to do. Telling us to be more effective,
[02:06:55] telling us to be more efficient, telling us to not waste time telling us to be in good physical
[02:07:02] condition and to strive always. Remember what he said. You're never a hundred percent combat
[02:07:12] effective. You never get there. You always have to strive to be better. So thank you general
[02:07:21] Clark for that. Yeah, Coach Charles. Mr. Speaking of getting better or at least always trying to
[02:07:31] get better striving to get better. Yes. Do we have any recommendations on you know making that happen?
[02:07:38] Yes, we do. Dave. We do. I just thought Dave looked at his watch. He's just looked at his watch thinking
[02:07:45] all right. I know I have worked to do. You know what's funny. You know what? I know Dave has worked to
[02:07:52] do. I know I have a job. I know there's one person. I must say they don't have work to do, but they
[02:07:59] might have less work to do. They might have a less of a stringent timeline to follow. Well, you did
[02:08:05] say might because you know you never do know. Okay. All right. All right. All right. All right.
[02:08:13] Okay. Okay. All the work I have to do. I'll tell you part of the work I have to do is inform my people
[02:08:20] our people. All right. Let's do it. On how to get through or should I say move forward on this path?
[02:08:26] We're all on boom. We're working out. We're taking due to if we can. We're reading. We're
[02:08:32] we're surrounding ourselves with good people. It's a sliding scale I understand. Nonetheless,
[02:08:38] these are things we're trying to do on this path. We need supplementation. Don't worry.
[02:08:43] Jocco is fuel. It's called jocco fuel. Supplementation for your whole body all the way up to your brain.
[02:08:51] The last cell in your brain. Anyway, what we got joint warfare? We got a lot of stuff. I told you my wife
[02:08:56] has an injury. That's a lot of feeding or joint warfare. It's not our feet. All right. That's what I'm talking about.
[02:09:01] Well, yeah, every day. So, joint warfare. Super krill oil. These are all for your joints.
[02:09:06] Three bones keep yourself in the game. Don't even have to worry about them anymore. You take this stuff.
[02:09:11] Also, we have discipline. Just for your brain. Ish. It's not just for your brain. It's what I'm saying.
[02:09:19] True. It's for your body too. So discipline, discipline, go and then discipline, go in the cans.
[02:09:25] It's all the same family. We'll say that accurately.
[02:09:28] Wait a minute. Accurate. Yeah. It's true. Yeah. A little note on discipline go in the cans. So,
[02:09:39] look, are we at war? Yes. I would say yes. I mean, from a business sense, we're at war.
[02:09:48] We've had, we've been attacked. We had an act. Well, let's just say this out of
[02:09:51] it. And when we've had an act of war against us, another very large energy drink company
[02:10:01] has spotted an insurgency happening. They didn't like it. They're trying to maneuver to shut
[02:10:09] down some of our manufacturing. But guess who had contingency planning? Yes, us. But where
[02:10:17] and where. So right now, hey, we are in a wall-watt in Florida. We want to be all over the East
[02:10:25] coast in a wall-watt and then we want to hit the rest of the stores across the country. If you're in
[02:10:28] Florida, go to a wall-watt, get some go, try some go. What flavors do you recommend? Dave?
[02:10:39] All of them. Let me ask you this. How many
[02:10:44] are you, are you, have you drank one flavor enough where you shifted to another flavor?
[02:10:50] Like I've done that with milk where I'll go on milk. I'll go on mint milk for three weeks. Then
[02:10:55] all of a sudden I'm like, well, that's strawberry. But right now, I'm on that pumpkin's,
[02:10:58] I'm on that smashing pumpkin pumpkin, pumpkin spice. That's that was crazy good. So have you,
[02:11:05] have you gone, are you go to rotate daily? Are you doing random out of the box? What are you doing?
[02:11:09] I try to go random out of the box or out of the fridge. I try to go random out of the fridge. I have
[02:11:14] not done that the last seven days. Because you're just straight. Dude, I am straight after
[02:11:20] burn orange. That's what I'm right now. So my older two daughters kind of speak their own language.
[02:11:28] And one of the words that they've been using a lot lately is if something is very good,
[02:11:33] then it's a fantasy and they say it in various funny ways.
[02:11:37] But then they've shortened it to say, FANTO. Oh, that's a FANT.
[02:11:44] And so the other day, my middle daughter took a drink of afterburner orange. And she said,
[02:11:52] oh, that's a FANT, like a FANTO.
[02:11:58] So there you go. There's a little, yeah, like orange FANTO, right?
[02:12:01] Yeah, there's a orange FANTO. I'm going to have to agree with that one. The orange afterburner
[02:12:07] orange. Yeah, that's the kind of the number one right now. It's good.
[02:12:11] Factually. I'm still just just jocopommer all day. Yeah. And I'm just having a chance.
[02:12:16] I will have probably for every four jocopommer. I will have one orange or one
[02:12:22] sour apple sniper. Maybe a DAX average, even though DAX average, people like my wife's DAX
[02:12:28] average all day. Yeah, I could see that. Sometimes I just want to get a little like the coat of
[02:12:34] my mind set. Sure. Just go get some of that. That can just that can is legit. Yeah. Yeah.
[02:12:41] Yes, sure. But yes, so yes discipline energy drink essentially. I said it. Yes, I said what I said.
[02:12:51] Energy drink ish health energy drink. It's real energy is what it is. It's real energy.
[02:12:57] Yeah. So nonetheless, yes, these are the supplementation elements that we can call upon
[02:13:04] on this path. Also, jocchi imagine milk. So you got all these different flavors of milk,
[02:13:10] protein in the form of dessert. He just meant a smashing pumpkin. I'm with it. I'm with the smashing
[02:13:15] pumpkin. Oh, yeah. What about kid approved to buy a kid's kids are all over that? It was declared
[02:13:22] a full fantasy in my house. Full fantasy. Is that the largest declared
[02:13:27] last smashing pumpkin? A full fantasy. Full fantasy. Okay. I'm going to kind of remember that
[02:13:32] see if it sticks. Well, actually, I don't know if I want to do that nonetheless. It does sound cool.
[02:13:36] When you say that your daughter said, but you can't start bringing it out. I can tell you that I won't
[02:13:41] start calling things like that. Oh, that will move in UFC was a full fantasy. Yes. Thank you.
[02:13:49] Not really, you're gonna flow. No, probably not. So speaking of full fantasy. Oh, that was cool.
[02:13:54] Yeah. This is a good cool. Speaking of cool and full fantasy. Jocco IT is also out there.
[02:13:59] Another light refreshing element that we haven't spent that much time talking about, but that's fine.
[02:14:05] It's still out there and it's still going strong. Of course. You can get that in a can as well.
[02:14:10] Right. You can get all this stuff at originmain.com. You can get it at the vitamin shop.
[02:14:16] Nationwide. You can get it at wall off Florida. This is what it was right now. It's November.
[02:14:22] Hopefully we'll get that whole East coast take a minute. Now, look, when I post that
[02:14:25] we're in a wall the other day. Everyone's all fired up and like, okay, what about 711, what about
[02:14:29] AMP and what it look, well, that's what that's the goal. Like I said, Florida's a little bit of a battleground state.
[02:14:37] So we hope, you know, when you you're hoping, but people in Florida will get after it.
[02:14:42] Yeah, fully. Wait, is Jocco IT in a wall or just the discipline. Just the discipline.
[02:14:46] Yep. Yeah. Okay. Well, there you go. Boom. Also at originmain.com, you can get this stuff. Also at originmain.com.

[02:16:35] since since then, I started to appreciate memes. Oh, yeah. I appreciate memes. And I even appreciate
[02:16:40] people that have, you know, like a hat that says veteran of the meme wars and they have,
[02:16:47] they've awarded, they've been awarded whatever award you get for the meme. Maybe they got a name.
[02:16:51] We're five, five names. Spot names. So yeah. The memes are good. Yes. But somehow, I don't,
[02:17:01] the memes don't float in me. It's always my son that shows me memes. Yeah. I don't know what the hell
[02:17:07] he subscribes to. Oh, is it some cram as you call it? But he shows me some memes that are funny.
[02:17:13] Yeah. They're really funny. Yeah. Whoever's making their smart people, like, you know,
[02:17:17] how you can, you know, some jokes are like, brother, that's like not even a, it's like a cheap
[02:17:22] joke that's not funny. And then somewhere like you got to be, whoever thought of that made that
[02:17:26] joke up is like a smart, funny person. Right. You know, like there's some impressive stuff on
[02:17:31] their frill. Like I inadvertently, well, or inadvertently, whatever, subscribe to like a bunch of them.

[02:17:52] represent with clothing, t-shirts, hoodies, discipline equals freedom. Good, all this stuff. Here's
[02:17:58] the thing. I said this last week, I'm saying it again. It's a big deal. We have a t-shirt club.
[02:18:06] Okay. So this is what the t-shirt club kind it is. It's like, okay, look. The t-shirt club is
[02:18:12] echo coming up with a lot of different t-shirts and me saying dude, we can't make a million
[02:18:17] different t-shirts because how are we going to keep a million different t-shirts
[02:18:21] in stock and how many and all that stuff. Yeah. And then you come up with a big creative.
[02:18:31] Yes, that. Well, you know, I guess it depends on you. You had the
[02:18:35] end state in mind. Yeah. Right. You figured out way to solve that problem. Well, I think it's good
[02:18:41] because also on top of that, which, um, yes, that's true. But on top of it, it's like sometimes
[02:18:47] we like, like, even you'll be like, hey, put this on a t-shirt or I'll be like, you know, like suggesting,
[02:18:52] like a t-shirt and it's a good, it's a fun, good idea or cool or cool. Because that's face that you
[02:18:58] come up with ideas for t-shirts that are fun and I come up with ideas for t-shirts that are cool.
[02:19:03] Oh yeah. Super cool. Extra cool. Are you done? Are you denying about that? No, no, no, no.
[02:19:09] Oh, good. It's true. It's 100% true, actually. But we can't just start like you said, just throwing
[02:19:15] these shirts on like or whatever, but the idea of, you know, so these ideas for shirts that they,
[02:19:21] they're doable. Also people, the people always say, can you make this t-shirt, can you make that
[02:19:25] t-shirt? That'd be a cool t-shirt. Yeah. And there's some that I'm like, that are shirts that we talk
[02:19:29] about. And then someone, you should do this shirt. But like, yeah, we just talked about that kind of thing,
[02:19:33] you know. So it's like all these ideas, hey, we'll throw it in one month. We'll have it, you know,
[02:19:38] you can have it. And it just goes on and on. It's good. A little subscription situation. Anyway,
[02:19:44] it's good t-shirt. Well, fun. Okay. So because you're kind of kind of just giving me a look,
[02:19:52] when I said I come up with cool t-shirt ideas, I'm going to say one, that will be available
[02:19:58] through the t-shirt. What is it subscription? Sure. Yeah. So here's one. podcast number 53.
[02:20:08] There's one part. This is the chosen Rev. Reservoir. We're talking about the book,
[02:20:12] colder than hell. And there's one point where the Marines are fighting for their lives.
[02:20:20] And there are assaulting down a hill. And there's a guy that guy that's writing the book is
[02:20:26] writing what he's seeing. And he sees these guys getting up and charging in one of the Marines
[02:20:31] is not holding a gun. He's holding a freaking axe. And he's charging at the Chinese communist
[02:20:37] mess and assaults their position. And so that's what I want to put it on a t-shirt. A silhouette,
[02:20:46] somehow of a crazy picture where you can tell that there is a Marine with an axe running down
[02:20:54] a sulting a communist position. And all I'm going to say is on that is like,
