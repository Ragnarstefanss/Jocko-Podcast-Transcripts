00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000 This is Jockel podcast number 228 with Eccle Charles and me, Jockel Willing.
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.000 Good evening, Eccle.
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.000 Good evening.
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000 And also joining us tonight, once again, is Dave Burke.
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.000 Good evening, Dave.
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.000 Good evening.
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000 So we only got through the first two sections of the Marine Corps,
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000 Doctional Learning Publication.
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000 Last time, we're the Doctional Publication Learning.
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.000 Last time.
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000 So we're going to finish it up today.
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:35.000 And I must say that since we covered that, since I read this for the first time,
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000 I've been trying to pay attention to things from a learning perspective.
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000 Learning things.
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:51.000 And I've actually talked to both of you about squeezing your brains.
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000 And we mentioned it on the last podcast, and we kind of bruised through it.
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000 Like, I think I just said, oh, yeah, I've been talking to you guys about squeezing your brains.
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.000 Kind of breeze through it.
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000 Didn't really talk about what that actually means.
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.000 So I wanted to, I wanted to kind of do a little discussion or dive into,
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.000 What does that mean?
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.000 What does it mean to squeeze your brain?
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000 Because it's important.
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000 It is so important to put pressure.
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.000 The pressure, put the pressure on your brain on your thoughts on how you're thinking
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.000 because that pressure creates heat and pressure in your mind,
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000 therefore creates energy.
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000 It creates ideas.
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000 And that is how we learn.
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000 That is how we get smarter.
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.000 That is how we get better from that pressure.
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000 And it ties back into something from the discipline of course freedom field manual,
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000 which is question everything.
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.000 Right?
00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000 Question everything.
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000 No matter where it's coming from, question your own ideas,
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000 question other people's ideas, you got to have that mindset,
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000 that kind of rebellious mindset where you're always going to push back against things.
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000 And I'm not talking about just being a contrary and where Dave comes up with an idea and I say,
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.000 well, what about this?
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000 I'm not talking about that.
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000 But I am talking about a subconscious dialogue that's happening,
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:26.000 where that's, I would say, my original form of applying pressure to my mind
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000 was sitting there saying, is there a better way to do that?
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000 Is there, I'm not saying I'm going to confront you,
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000 but I'm thinking myself, is there a better way to do that?
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000 Am I wrong about it?
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000 If I come up with it, am I wrong about this idea?
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000 Is the tradition wrong?
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000 Is the way, you know, the complaint about,
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000 oh, this is how we all do it.
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000 And I'm constantly saying, well, just because we do it that way,
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000 is that tradition wrong?
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000 Is that standard wrong?
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000 And in order to answer those questions, in order to answer those questions,
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.000 it puts pressure on your brain, it puts pressure on your mind.
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000 Because oftentimes the ideas that you're questioning,
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000 the ideas that you're questioning the standards that you're questioning,
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000 the tradition that you're questioning are things that have been around for a while.
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000 You've survived some level of pressure.
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000 So to think that you're going to come up with some new way is,
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.000 it's a little bit ridiculous, but at the same time,
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000 you have to do it.
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000 You have to do it too, free your mind,
00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:38.000 which I used to post that on a pretty regular basis for you,
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000 but in order to free your mind,
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000 you actually have to add weight,
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:53.000 you have to put a force on top of your mind and your ideas in order to,
00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:01.000 in order to squeeze out results in order to free it.
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000 And when you do that, then that's when you improve.
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.000 And I'm not talking about the kind of,
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000 hey, you know, all the constant self-improvement, right?
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000 I'm not talking about, I'm actually getting better.
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.000 I'm talking about actual answers to real answers to questions.
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:26.000 Actually, we'll improve understanding of the world.
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:32.000 Improved understanding of the world.
00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.000 So I've been talking about this day.
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000 And this is just kind of happening.
00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000 I think I sense a light switch,
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000 flipper, whatever you want to call it.
00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:55.000 EF Online, you were coming up with sort of the discussion point for the day.
00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000 And so EF Online is, we got a bunch of people coming on.
00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000 They're interacting with us. It's a Zoom meeting,
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000 which I think the whole world is now familiar with.
00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:12.000 Zoom meeting. So we've expanded our online presence and we're really putting a lot of time and effort behind EF Online.
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.000 And so we've been running these three times a week online community,
00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000 brigade of people.
00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.000 And so you were, you were kind of leading the discussion on this particular one.
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000 And I think the question that spurned you to squeeze your brain a little bit was,
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000 how do you adapt to a changing world?
00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000 And you went through this story about when you were in the Marine Corps,
00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000 and when you were a top gun instructor,
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000 and what the Marine Corps was doing and what top gun was doing was preparing,
00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:47.000 being prepared to fight the Meg 29, the Meg 29 full-groom,
00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000 which is an aircraft that is correct me from wrong.
00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000 The full-groom is not as good as our aircraft.
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.000 And not as good as an F-18.
00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000 Yeah, that's right. F-14?
00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.000 Probably better than the F-14.
00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000 So that's better than the F-14, but not as good as an F-18.
00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.000 Yep.
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000 And that's what you, when you went to top gun as a student,
00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.000 that's what they were telling you, okay, this is what you need to be prepared to fight.
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000 Yeah, the Meg 29, that's right.
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000 An aircraft that's not quite as good as yours.
00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000 Not quite as good as your F-18.
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000 That's what they were telling you.
00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000 So then you leave, and I get this right, you leave top gun school.
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:29.000 And when you come back now to be the instructor, the senior instructor, eventually,
00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000 the Russians had a new aircraft.
00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.000 Yeah, that's right.
00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.000 That was the SU-27 Flanker, which actually, I was excited to know,
00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000 that happens to be my favorite bird.
00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.000 I like, have you ever seen that bird?
00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.000 No.
00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:46.000 It looks like a cobra that's getting ready to strike.
00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000 It's just an awesome look in aircraft.
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000 And it was now this aircraft is better than an F-18.
00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.000 Yeah.
00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000 Were you in for the F-14s at all?
00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.000 Yes.
00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:57.000 So I-
00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.000 So I-
00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.000 They phase out F-14s.
00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.000 So the last F-14 class at Top Gun was probably 2004,
00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.000 as when we phased him out.
00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.000 They probably flew a little bit in the fleet,
00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.000 but I was there as an instructor during the last Tomcat class.
00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000 Correct me if I'm wrong.
00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:17.000 In my mind, the F-the Tomcat has always been the muscle car.
00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.000 The muscle car of the fighter jets.
00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000 Yeah, it's like an iconic muscle machine.
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000 For tuning, I've got a lot of power.
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.000 Yep.
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.000 I can go fast.
00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.000 Yep.
00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000 I'm not going to corner a great, right?
00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000 Yeah, it's a more of a brute force machine,
00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000 really fast, really cool airplane,
00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.000 but a little bit dated by the time I was there at Top Gun.
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.000 So you're used to F-18.
00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000 Now the SU-27 is now a real thing.
00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.000 Yeah.
00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000 And you come back as an instructor.
00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:51.000 The people, the thing that you all were preparing to fight
00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000 was still the, the make 29.
00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000 And you, I guess, looked at this and said,
00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000 a not a good plan.
00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.000 There's something better.
00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000 We should be prepared to fight the worst case scenario,
00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000 which for us is the SU-27.
00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.000 Yeah.
00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.000 That's right.
00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000 And it wasn't even just the worst case scenario.
00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000 It was just the reality that this thing was being proliferated.
00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000 So the Russians weren't just building it.
00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.000 They were selling it.
00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.000 So it was going other places too.
00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000 So you could have, well, we're not going to go to war with the Russians.
00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.000 Like, okay, maybe not.
00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.000 Maybe we're not going to go to the war with the Russians.
00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000 But this airplane is going to find itself in places
00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000 that we wouldn't even know.
00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000 And if we showed up to meet that thing and we were unprepared,
00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000 we're going to get rolled.
00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.000 And that was a big deal.
00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000 We're going to get rolled.
00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000 So you saw this new world, basically.
00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000 And you adapted to the new threat.
00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000 You adapted to this new reality.
00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000 And that was the lesson that you were trying to share on the F-Online,
00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000 which was, hey, when you get a new reality,
00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000 which, by the way, this is all in reference to COVID-19,
00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000 what's the new reality?
00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000 And we've got every different spectrum of business on there.
00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000 So it means different things to different people.
00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000 And the bottom line is the lesson was you get ahead of the new reality.
00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.000 You don't wait for it.
00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000 You get ahead of it.
00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:03.000 And when we got off the call or whatever,
00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000 and I talked to you about it.
00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000 And I said, something like, hey, that was a,
00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:09.000 that was a solid lesson.
00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.000 Like, did you squeeze your brain to get that out?
00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000 And you said something like, yeah, I did.
00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.000 I squeezed my brain.
00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:21.000 I thought about, you know, what is this situation?
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.000 And how can I explain it better?
00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:27.000 And when you do that, you understand better.
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.000 Right? Like, you Dave Burke, when you, when you,
00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000 when you put that threat out there and you, you,
00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000 you, you carried us through that story.
00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000 You understood things better.
00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000 And that's why when I get all excited about understanding the world in a better way,
00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000 that's an example of how, even you,
00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.000 this is something that you know, it's something that you actually did as a human being.
00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:57.000 And yet until you recognize it from that other perspective until you scream,
00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.000 you squeeze your brain and pressure on your brain,
00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000 you don't get the benefit of it.
00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000 The real benefit, the next level of benefit.
00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:13.000 And then when you start to tie these threads to other things,
00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:18.000 other things that don't always, always appear to be related like COVID-19
00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:24.000 and make 29s, but they are related, then you win.
00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:33.000 So every time you put pressure on your mind, you force yourself to think better and get better.
00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.000 And this happened to me the other day again.
00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.000 And it happens to me, I'll be honest with you, it actually happens to me a decent amount.
00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:45.000 Because I'm always, again, I'm always kind of put that pressure on there.
00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000 I'm always squeezing it.
00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:53.000 And it was another EF online scenario.
00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:58.000 And what's good about EF online is look when people send me a question over social media.
00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:59.000 It's cool.
00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000 And we try to answer the question, but you can't get any context around it.
00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000 On EF online, you're getting the context, the person there.
00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000 In this case, in particular, this is a guy named Ben.
00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000 And he was talking about being on the path.
00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000 And at the time, it was something along these lines.
00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:15.000 He's been furloughed.
00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000 He's not in charge of anyone right now.
00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:18.000 He's stuck at home.
00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000 It'd be a good time to get in shape.
00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000 But he's having trouble doing it.
00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:23.000 Right?
00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:30.000 So I went down the path of, again, because the way this story was unfolding from him,
00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000 he's normally at work.
00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.000 He's normally in charge of people.
00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000 So we're talking about it from a leadership perspective.
00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.000 And I said something like, hey, you are not in charge of anyone else right now.
00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000 But you're your own CEO, which is something we hear all the time, right?
00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:47.000 You're your own CEO, you're your own Supreme Commander.
00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000 You're your own general.
00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.000 And he got it.
00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.000 And he said, thanks.
00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:52.000 And that was cool.
00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000 I thought I kept thinking about it.
00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:59.000 Because it was some like thing in my brain where it makes sense.
00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000 But it's not that easy.
00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000 It's actually not that easy.
00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.000 Because here's the deal.
00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000 You are your own general of your life.
00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:09.000 You're going to come up with a plan.
00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.000 You're going to make decisions.
00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.000 You're going to give orders, right?
00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000 That's what's going to happen.
00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.000 Here's the part that I was kind of missing.
00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000 Is that yes, you're your own general.
00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.000 You're your own commander on the battlefield.
00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.000 But you are also the soldiers.
00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000 You are also the troops.
00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.000 You are.
00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:37.000 And we actually know, factually, that troops don't just blindly follow orders.
00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:38.000 That doesn't happen.
00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000 We, hey, look, we would like that to be happening.
00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:42.000 Right?
00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000 Well, let me rephrase that.
00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.000 That's the scenario that people think would be totally ideal.
00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000 That I borrow orders and everyone listens to me.
00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000 But we know we know that that doesn't work.
00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:54.000 It doesn't work in a military.
00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.000 It doesn't work in business.
00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000 It doesn't work in a military.
00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:58.000 It doesn't work in business.
00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.000 It doesn't work with your kids.
00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000 It doesn't work.
00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000 You have to get people to a certain point.
00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:05.000 They have to be trained.
00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:06.000 They have to be educated.
00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000 They have to be disciplined.
00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:13.000 They have to know why they're doing what they're doing.
00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:18.000 And if you don't explain these things to them, then they're not going to do what they
00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.000 supposed to do.
00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.000 Right?
00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.000 They're not going to do what they're supposed to do.
00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000 If you, if you don't build that relationship,
00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:29.000 if you don't have that unifying mission, it's not going to work.
00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:36.000 So, if you're too close to your feelings, all kinds of parallels.
00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000 If you're too close to your feelings, right?
00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:43.000 If you're reacting to your feelings, like, oh, I really don't feel like doing this.
00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000 Then your feelings are going to start to drive the way you act.
00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000 And we don't necessarily want that all the time.
00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000 Just like a leader.
00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000 If a leader is too close to his troops and the troops are pushing back,
00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000 he's so, we don't want to do that.
00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000 Okay, you guys don't feel, okay, you see what I'm saying?
00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:01.000 It's like a perfect parallel.
00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:06.000 At the same time, if you just bark orders at your troops,
00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000 and they don't know why they're doing what they're doing,
00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.000 then they're not going to commit to doing it in any meaningful way.
00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:21.000 And just like troops, if you're a grunt and I bark orders at you, you go, yep, yes sir, you go do it.
00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000 I do that to you the next day, you go do it.
00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000 I do that to you the next day, all of a sudden you're not, you're lagging.
00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000 I do that to you for a month, you're not invested anymore.
00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.000 Same thing, so when you say to yourself, I'm just going to get up,
00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000 I'm going to get up and do it.
00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.000 That's cool.
00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000 In my work for a day, it might work for two days, it might work for three days.
00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:46.000 And sometimes I absolutely use that, use that type of leadership with myself,
00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000 where I'm, you know, hey, look, there's no time to debate right now.
00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000 You need to get up and go to your workout.
00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:57.000 But if you try and make that the way that the only way that you're leading yourself,
00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:02.000 functionally over time, it's going to fall short.
00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.000 If you push your troops too hard, they're going to break.
00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:10.000 Right, you can actually push yourself so hard that you break.
00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000 You can over-trained.
00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.000 If you're too easy on your troops, you can then soft.
00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000 Same thing with what the way you happens with yourself.
00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000 The better you try.
00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:23.000 This is an important one.
00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:27.000 The better you train your troops, the better they respond.
00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:31.000 So once my troops are used to, hey, this is how I do it.
00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:32.000 This is why I do it.
00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000 Once they're used to that, they respond better.
00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000 They know what it is I want from them.
00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:44.000 They want to give me that response, just like when you follow a routine every day.
00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000 And you know what you're supposed to do.
00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:50.000 And you're troop, your mental soldiers know what they're supposed to do.
00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000 They start to respond better.
00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:56.000 When you realize when your mental troops know that, hey,
00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000 dog was gonna work out.
00:15:58.000 --> 00:15:59.000 It's gonna happen.
00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.000 And we could either stand around and procrastinate
00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000 or we could just suck it up and go get it done.
00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000 They go, can I want, hey, this is going that way.
00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.000 So the better you train your mental troops,
00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000 the better you're going to get a response from them.
00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:19.000 The better the better you take care of your mental troops.
00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.000 The more they're going to take care of you.
00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:26.000 As long as you don't cough them as long as you don't spoil them
00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:30.000 because once again, they're going to be soft and they're going to be worthless.
00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:34.000 So you are leading yourself.
00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:35.000 That's the thing.
00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:36.000 You are leading yourself.
00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:42.000 You are in charge, but you are also the troops that have to do the work.
00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:46.000 And if you understand it that way, then you can actually start to pay attention
00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:53.000 between the relationship that you have with you as the leader and you as the troops.
00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:58.000 And the connection between where you are and where it is you want to go.
00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:03.000 Because the general might want to secure a beachhead.
00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:10.000 But that's meaningless without the troops taking action and making it happen.
00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:18.000 So the ideas and plans of the generals have to be executed by the chain of command.
00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:25.000 And they might do it out of fear for a minute, but they're not going to do it for a long period of time.
00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000 They will do it out of honor.
00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000 They will do it out of pride.
00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:34.000 They will do it if they understand the long term goal.
00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:39.000 They will do it if the goal of the general is aligned with the goals of the troops.
00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:47.000 If they're not aligned, we're not going to get what we want.
00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:56.000 So whether you're talking about the chain of command inside your own head or the chain of command in the military,
00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:00.000 the chain of command of business, leadership is leadership.
00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:08.000 And we cannot lead if we don't earn.
00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:18.000 We can't learn if we don't put pressure on our minds to make them figure things out.
00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.000 Learning.
00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:26.000 And with that, let's go back to the book.
00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.000 You've ever seen the movie Goodfellis?
00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:29.000 Yes.
00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:37.000 So there's this scene where Joe Pashy, I think, his girl just came from the air.
00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:41.000 He just came from the airport, smuggled some diamonds in her hair.
00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:47.000 So it's a long, and she's like, okay, let's get these diamonds out and she's doing this.
00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:51.000 They're all falling out and she's like, yep, that's it.
00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:55.000 And they're like, hey, you sure you don't got any but they're got to be more in there.
00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:56.000 There has to be.
00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000 She's like, this is it.
00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.000 So she's like, oh, there's no.
00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:06.000 And he essentially squeezes her little hair, do shuffles him in a few more diamonds come out.
00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:07.000 All right.
00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.000 So that's the first.
00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:10.000 It's the same thing.
00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:17.000 You do a little bit of a breath and remember how we were talking about this before, where you're
00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:24.000 essentially when you told me about the brain squeeze was essentially a rebuttal to the idea that,
00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:30.000 if it's just not coming to me, hey, it's not it's time, you know, it'll come in time or not at all.
00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:31.000 Right.
00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.000 Like it then it's not meant to be almost kind of thing, right?
00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.000 That was your rebuttal because you thought that that's essentially what I was saying.
00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.000 I wasn't saying that, but that's what you thought I was saying.
00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:44.000 And that makes sense, especially when you go back, not especially, but when you go back to the good fellow
00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.000 is the analogy where, you know, in her mind, yeah, hey, that's it.
00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:48.000 That's all we got.
00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.000 You know, what am I going to do?
00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:51.000 Shave my head?
00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:52.000 No.
00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:53.000 Right.
00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:54.000 That's all I got.
00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.000 You know, and Joe Bessier was like, oh man, we're going to do that little brain squeeze.
00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:57.000 We're going to get a few more diamonds.
00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:58.000 How do you?
00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:01.000 That's a, that's a, that's sensible.
00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:02.000 You know, sir.
00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:03.000 You get one credit for today.
00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.000 I think I understood.
00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:06.000 I think I understand.
00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:07.000 And now black already.
00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:08.000 Yeah.
00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.000 Well, you talked to me about that.
00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:15.000 I figured it was that you're talking about making videos, which is your creative pursuit on the earth.
00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:16.000 Sure.
00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:17.000 Wonderful.
00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:21.000 And you were telling me that sometimes, you know, this, this idea is a little bit of an idea, whatever,
00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.000 and then it fades and you forget about it or you don't execute on it.
00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:32.000 And I was telling you that, in fact, the little ideas just aren't going to grow to be,
00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:36.000 outstanding without some pressure on them.
00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.000 That put them a little squeeze on.
00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.000 You're not going to get those diamonds out.
00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:49.000 You know, I was going to hang out and, you know, I guess maybe part of me when I'm kind of thinking back on that whole scenario or a scenario scenario's like it.
00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:54.000 Or I'm kind of like, or I was with the philosophy of like, well, hey, look, if there's some diamonds in there,
00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:55.000 hey, they're gone.
00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:01.000 I come out, you know, let's let them come out naturally so they can kind of, you know, through their own
00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:07.000 evolution kind of manifest themselves kind of thing, you know, and I think after thinking about it,
00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.000 it's like, man, I don't know if that's the best way.
00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:14.000 I'm reviewing my entire life right now in my head, all of it.
00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:22.000 As fast as I can, and I'm going to say that I think if I didn't put pressure on my head,
00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.000 I would be zero.
00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:25.000 I would be zero.
00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:26.000 My score would be zero.
00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.000 There would be zero diamonds on the table.
00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:29.000 Zero.
00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:33.000 Not that I'm saying I got diamonds on the table, but at least there's some pieces of coal.
00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:40.000 That's come out and they can, they can whatever we can scratch some black marks on a, on a page or whatever, like at least it's something.
00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:41.000 It's bet.
00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:42.000 It's not nothing.
00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:43.000 It's nothing.
00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:44.000 Right.
00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:45.000 So we're going to have to do it.
00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:51.000 But this perspective of learning and one of the, one of the things that I realized I never thought about before,
00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:56.000 when they talk about learning, as we covered on the last podcast, they're talking about,
00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:02.000 if I see the enemy do something, that was effective, I learned.
00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:06.000 I never thought about learning from that perspective before in my life.
00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.000 So this is a new development.
00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:13.000 But now I just took that idea and started thinking about how,
00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:17.000 there's a lot of things I've learned along the way.
00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:21.000 And I was trying to pull the thread and see what the source of that was.
00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:26.000 And a lot of it boiled back down to like asking questions of everything that I see.
00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:29.000 And again, I'm not talking about being a contrarian because,
00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:34.000 Contrarians, they have their time in place and I'm sure sometimes I might be a little bit,
00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:37.000 actually I don't actually don't think that.
00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.000 I don't think I'm a contrarian.
00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:44.000 I think I will, if there's an idea that is contrary to what someone is saying,
00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:48.000 and I would like to explore whether it's right or not, I will bring it up all day long.
00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:52.000 But I won't bring up an idea just to kind of be different.
00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:53.000 For the sake of doing it.
00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.000 I've worked for people like that.
00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.000 Yeah, it's like part of their personality.
00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:00.000 I work from one in particular and it was just super annoying.
00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:03.000 You know, and I just have to be like,
00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:05.000 especially because he was a senior guy.
00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:08.000 And so his little contrarian statements would,
00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:13.000 would send people in directions that I wish we were not going,
00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:15.000 because I knew that they were not going to prove.
00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:19.000 They weren't going to provide any fruit on the other side.
00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:21.000 Definitely no diamonds were going on.
00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:24.000 The brain squeeze also,
00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.000 it does like secondary stuff too,
00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:29.000 where let's say you're trying to squeeze your brain.
00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:35.000 I need this idea to kind of fulfill this last element of this comprehensive idea that I want to put out.
00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:38.000 I need this one little element and I'm squeezing my brain.
00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:42.000 No diamonds yet, but other stuff is coming out.
00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:45.000 Maybe some collateral.
00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:48.000 Maybe some, you know, maybe a ruby over here.
00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:51.000 Or what do you call those blue ones, the sapphire, whatever.
00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:52.000 Maybe over there.
00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:54.000 I don't need that right now, but that came out.
00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:56.000 Maybe I'll save that one for later.
00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:59.000 Maybe maybe those will be part of a future idea.
00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:02.000 So boom, you got all these jewels essentially.
00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:05.000 And then finally, let's say the diamond doesn't come out.
00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:07.000 Let's say it straight up doesn't come out.
00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:08.000 You got all those rubies and stuff.
00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:09.000 If you didn't do that brain squeeze,
00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:13.000 you can say I have no diamond anyway without those other jewels, you seem to say.
00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:19.000 Yeah, I'm taking a subconscious kind of note to myself,
00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:29.000 or I'm putting myself on subconscious notice because like you and I are sitting here just throwing around that we're just producing diamonds.
00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:33.000 And that's so just not true, but it's a metaphor.
00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:46.000 Yes, producing an idea which may or may not have value, but the thing is it doesn't exist unless you put some pressure on your on your mind.
00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:48.000 And it's so just like working out, right?
00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:50.000 You're not going to get stronger if you don't put some pressure on you.
00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:53.000 You're not going to get better to just who unless you get some pressure put on you.
00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:54.000 Doesn't happen.
00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:56.000 So you have to put pressure on your mind.
00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:02.000 The thing is you can so easily go through life right now without putting any pressure on your mind.
00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.000 You can go through life right now.
00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:18.000 And I guess when I'm talking about you can be a 36 year old, a 42 year old, a 19 year old and put no pressure on your brain and just resort to the modules of knowledge that you have.
00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:26.000 And if they don't fit that well, it's cool just just you know put some spackle over it.
00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.000 Call it good.
00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:32.000 Yeah, all right.
00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.000 Dave relatively quiet over there.
00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.000 Dude, I'm listening now.
00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:38.000 That's that was pretty legit.
00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:42.000 And yeah, squeezing your brain, you're not talking about that for a while.
00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:50.000 And that particular case was kind of cool because I didn't know that I was going to be leading that, you know, taking point on the initial conversation.
00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:55.000 But a couple days prior after we talked about it, I started thinking about it.
00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:02.000 Dave, calm as a came in, can you can you take lead on the Eiffon line on Wednesday, like absolutely I've heard him thinking about it.
00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:07.000 Which was also a really cool thing that I didn't think about when we were talking about the squeezing your brain.
00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:10.000 It makes you feel more prepared about things that life in general.
00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:15.000 Not that I was trying to produce, I wasn't thinking to produce some thing for the Eiffon line module.
00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:18.000 That wasn't why I did it.
00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:21.000 And then when he asked me, I'm like, yes, absolutely.
00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:28.000 And then I spent more time creating that, you know, but I'd already been thinking about things to make the connection because we've been doing that so much.
00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:30.000 And the world has been changing for a lot of people.
00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:31.000 God it.
00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:40.000 And I just started spending some time squeezing my brain, not to produce something that was for a deliverable or a client request that wasn't about the outcome.
00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:41.000 It was about doing it.
00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:44.000 And it was pretty interesting how those two aligned.
00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:49.000 And it's like, hey, can you do this? I'm like, actually, no factor because I've been thinking about it.
00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:58.000 So you've been getting kind of broad questions from clients about how do we adapt to what's happening and you started squeezing your brain to figure out.
00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:01.000 Yeah, way to explain that.
00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.000 That would be very clear.
00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:10.000 And it would make people connect the process of doing it to a story, which makes it easier to understand.
00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:12.000 Well, the stories are important.
00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:16.000 But as we've, as we've been continuing to answer questions,
00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:19.000 you have to find more ways to convey that message.
00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:22.000 Some resonate and some don't as well.
00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:26.000 And sometimes what would go on a month ago is actually a little bit different than what's going on now.
00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:33.000 So I wanted to think of more effective ways to be able to communicate things for people to listen to and do something about.
00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:38.000 And that was what the squeezing the brain was initially for me is I have to be better in explaining what I think is going on.
00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:41.000 So people can do a better job dealing with it.
00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:47.000 And if I just kind of go with the same way I've done it that little role with the ex I've got, like I'll just go back to module B coming like, well,
00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:49.000 module B doesn't always work for everybody.
00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:54.000 It's made it makes me smarter like you described, but it also makes me more effective for those people.
00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.000 So I was just thinking about it in those terms.
00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:58.000 And then he's like, hey man, can you do this?
00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:00.000 Yeah, I've been thinking about this a lot lately.
00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:03.000 And of course, we've been talking about it.
00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:06.000 And I've been thinking about it a lot in general in a whole bunch of different ways.
00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:09.000 And it isn't always just like, what can I do to convey further people?
00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:17.000 I actually more about me and just getting better at thinking about things and getting better at making decisions, getting better at solving problems.
00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:21.000 Because I actually am not as good as I need to be on that, not even close.
00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:25.000 Yeah, the idea that what you're talking about is learning.
00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:27.000 That's what we're talking about.
00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:38.000 We're talking about learning and learning can be a passive thing where you're waiting for someone to show you the way or it can be something that you're proactively engaged your brain in.
00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:39.000 Yeah.
00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:41.000 And I think this book, I can't remember exactly.
00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:47.000 This idea of this learning being continuous process, the biggest weight against me personally.
00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:48.000 This is probably true for a lot of folks.
00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:53.000 Continue to do this is looking back and be like, I have to pretty well for myself.
00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:54.000 You know, I'm at this stage of my life.
00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:55.000 I've accomplished these things.
00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:59.000 And that's the biggest weight against continuing to do this.
00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:01.000 And this is what keeps me from getting complacent.
00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:04.000 It's what keeps me from getting comfortable.
00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:05.000 What I've already done.
00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:11.000 I think we we we laughed about it the other day. I was telling you like I actually forgot I was in the Marine Corps for 23 years.
00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:16.000 Because I'm so focused on trying to figure out a whole bunch of other things that I'm not good enough at yet.
00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:21.000 And it's actually healthy to not rest on the laurels of whatever I did in the past.
00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:24.000 Because that actually isn't enough to keep me moving forward.
00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:29.000 And if this actually is continuously going to do this, you have to do this thing all the time all the time.
00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:31.000 Don't you find though.
00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:37.000 Reverse kind of over laying new information on what happened in the past.
00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:40.000 Speaking of the F online, I did that today.
00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.000 I was talking about.
00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:46.000 Mike's really it's we covered up when Mike's really was on the podcast.
00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:53.000 The first thing I did when Mike's really checked in this asking a bruiser, he's checking in late is I gave him a counseling, a written counseling.
00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:57.000 And I was explaining why I did it.
00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:05.000 And I actually like back then whatever it was 15 years ago or something like that 15 years ago when I met him.
00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:07.000 If you would have said, why did you do that?
00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:10.000 You know what I was said? Because he checked in and he needs to be squared away or something like that.
00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:11.000 I would have given this.
00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:15.000 But if you would have actually squeezed my brain at the time and said, wait a second.
00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:16.000 No, Jocco.
00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:19.000 You're in a leadership position.
00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:23.000 You take action because for a reason.
00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:30.000 Tell me why you actually, why did you actually decide of everyone that's in task in a bruiser?
00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.000 You got this new guy coming in.
00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:41.000 Why is it him that you've decided at this point in time that you want to give him a written counseling the minute he checks in?
00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:44.000 And I was thinking about it.
00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:47.000 And I was squeezing my brain and I realized a couple things.
00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:53.000 And I was trying to convince him to have a better one. He was coming from a task in it that just self-destructed.
00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:55.000 And I didn't want to any of that drama.
00:30:55.000 --> 00:31:00.000 Number two, I wanted to know that I was serious about what we do.
00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:06.000 And the last one, the one that I had to squeeze my brain to get to is I didn't know Mike.
00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:09.000 And we were going to deploy in a few months.
00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:12.000 And I needed to know who this guy was.
00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:16.000 I knew who is a primary and who is a prior recon and who is prior sniper.
00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.000 And I, but I didn't know him.
00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:22.000 And so by me taking this young officer,
00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:25.000 date the minute I meet him and say, yeah, come talk to me.
00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:27.000 And I hand him a counseling sheet.
00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:31.000 And when it said something along lines of, hey, there's no drama in task in a bruiser.
00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:34.000 So don't bring any drama in a task in a bruiser.
00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.000 And Mike was like Roger that.
00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.000 They need to sign it.
00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:42.000 And that moment where I saw his reaction.
00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:46.000 Yes, what this whole thing was really about. It was really just a test to see who am I getting.
00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:48.000 Is this guy have a big ego? Is this guy have a bad attitude?
00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.000 Is this guy think he smarter than everybody else?
00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:52.000 Is he, when I say, hey, I want you to sign this counseling.
00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:55.000 Should he be going to say, this ridiculous, why should I be yours?
00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:58.000 You're going to roll his eyes at me or is he going to, you know,
00:31:58.000 --> 00:31:59.000 Huff and paw for whatever.
00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:01.000 This is ego going to come out.
00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:03.000 That's, that's the purpose.
00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:06.000 And I can now look back and see, hey, totally.
00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:09.000 That's, that's, that's one of the reasons why I did it.
00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:16.000 And that all came from that all came from the fact that I was talking to this other woman on
00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:20.000 EF online and talking about the Willy Wonka,
00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:23.000 Freaking example of how you test somebody.
00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:25.000 The end of, you ever seen the movie Willy Wonka, echoed Charles?
00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:26.000 The original?
00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:27.000 No, sir.
00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:29.000 That's pathetic.
00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:34.000 The end of the original Willy Wonka, he goes off berserk and tries to get the person to
00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:41.000 change his mind or to reveal himself as either being a thief and untrustworthy or being
00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:42.000 trustworthy.
00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:44.000 So I had explained that to him.
00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:47.000 And so now I could see clearly why I'm doing this.
00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:50.000 So even though you might say, I forget about being the Marine Corps and I get what you're saying
00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:55.000 Like it's, it's, yeah, I get what you're saying, but, but the reality is you take
00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:59.000 What, you take this new thing that, this new thing that came out of your brain
00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:03.000 And you overlay it on the past and you go, oh, this makes,
00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:05.000 This makes total sense now.
00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:08.000 Oh, I totally see why I would do that.
00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:10.000 And so it's a little reverse engineering.
00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:15.000 It's actually a lot of reverse engineering, but it also reveals, hey, where did I make mistakes?
00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:20.000 What did I do wrong? Why did I do? Why did I back this way when I shouldn't have?
00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:25.000 If you want to take the things that you've learned and turn them into a little bit of
00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:29.000 Wisdom that might be helpful for you or your kids or the people around you,
00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:31.000 You have to do what you just described.
00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:36.000 And that's been the part that I've been wrestling with as I look back and think I did a lot of things.
00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:43.000 But I didn't think about why I was doing them nearly enough to be as wise or articulate as I should be to look back.
00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:48.000 And so I didn't taking those lessons now, and I was just one of a million different things I could think of and think
00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:51.000 What were we really doing when we were doing that?
00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:57.000 And if you don't do that, all it is is an experience and the thing that matters the most is what you took from that
00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:02.000 Not just for you, but for the people around you, if you want to create some wisdom from that, you have to do what you just described
00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:06.000 And that was one of a million more things I have to do, and that's part of the reason why I was so fun
00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:09.000 As I took this cool story from Top Gun, I'm like, you know what?
00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:12.000 I didn't really think about why we're doing, there's a big thing what we're doing it
00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:18.000 And I didn't really think about it, and there is no way I would have thought, could what we were doing now
00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:24.000 Somehow be helpful somewhere else down the line other than rebased line and Top Gun training for this next aircraft
00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:27.000 That's what I thought we were doing, that is not what we were doing
00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:33.000 There was so much more going on there, and the squeezing of my brain is trying to create a much larger context
00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:40.000 For all these things that I did in those 23 years that I look back and I'm like, dude, if you want this to be useful, you have to think about it a lot more
00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:48.000 Yeah, and it's crazy that when you see the patterns, the pattern recognition over time, you go, yeah, that's what I was doing there, yep, that's
00:34:48.000 --> 00:35:01.000 And for me that a lot of that stem from GJ2, because that's when I started connecting the dots of, oh, you don't want to attack an area that's reinforced in on the battlefield in GJ2 or in as a leader
00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:08.000 You don't want to attack an area, okay, I got that, oh, you need to maneuver, you need to, you need to be able to move, right?
00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:12.000 Think about that, just think about that concept in GJ2
00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:22.000 When you get, when you get immobilized, you are on the way to defeat the minute that you can no longer move, you are on your way to defeat
00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:39.000 Well, on the battlefield, if you can't maneuver anymore, if you dig in and you can't move, you're on your way to defeat, and mentally, if you close your mind and you stop thinking and seeing other perspectives and keeping an open mind, you are on your way to defeat
00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:54.000 So when you start taking these and seeing them in other areas, it opens your mind up, it frees your mind in so many different ways and that is learning, that's what it is
00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:59.000 All right, little preamble
00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:10.000 So chapter 3, the learning environment, it is necessary for us to learn from others mistakes, you will not live long enough to make them all yourself
00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:13.000 That's, that's a, at Marickover
00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:24.000 Next one, our knowledge of circumstances has increased, but our uncertainty instead of having diminished has only increased
00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:30.000 The reason of this is that we do not gain all our experience at once, but by degrees
00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:37.000 So our determinations continue to be assailed, incessantly, by fresh experience
00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:44.000 And the mind, if we may use the expression, must always be under arms
00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:50.000 So new things are going to come about and you got to be, he's using, he's using kind of a different metaphor
00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:57.000 I'm saying keep your mind open, he's like you got to be ready ready to adapt, keep your mind under pressure
00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:01.000 Yeah, under pressure, exactly
00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:06.000 Next here, victory does not necessarily go to those who have the largest or most modern forces
00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:15.000 But to those who are able to recognize the need to adapt, generate intelligent decisions and execute them more quickly than their enemy
00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:22.000 Victory does not go to the person who's the biggest and strongest
00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:24.000 Echo, yes sir
00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:30.000 It goes to the person who can adapt, who can make intelligent decisions and execute them quickly
00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:38.000 Skipping ahead in the progress in the progression of learning, training should provide marines with an opposing will to practice against
00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:44.000 Through repetition and a training environment marines loaned out think adversaries and over-completion
00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:49.000 Prior to encountering these factors during real world operations
00:37:49.000 --> 00:38:00.000 Therefore marines must integrate lessons learned from current and previous conflicts to adapt their learning environments, methods, assessments and feedback to reflect evolving threats
00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:03.000 Got a lot of questions about this one
00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:06.000 A lot of questions of how do I get my mind ready to do this?
00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:08.000 It's easy to sit here and talk about it
00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:14.000 Hey, you want to be adaptable, hey you want to be able to detach, you want to be able to handle pressure
00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:15.000 How do I actually do that?
00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:18.000 Oh, you got to put yourself in those environments
00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:23.000 You've got to go against an opposing will in order to practice
00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:25.000 Sparring
00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:28.000 That is due to yes
00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:30.000 You know what what is a barrier?
00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:36.000 Well, for you it might not be underrated because you have seemed to know the importance of it
00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:41.000 Value but role play right like role playing scenarios or whatever
00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:47.000 Yes, we do 100% see the value right, but that role playing goes deep though because and I
00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:51.000 I don't want to say I learned it for me, but you really
00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:55.000 You brought it to light the importance and how of how
00:38:55.000 --> 00:39:02.000 Good it it works, but just how easy it is to do so I think like okay, so I'll make kid
00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:08.000 He's three and I'm going to say hey, don't like wine or whatever
00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:13.000 And they'll be like what or don't be what I say you say you stand up straight and say yes or when I say your name
00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:18.000 You say yes or I don't require them to do that, but it was like a practice to have a certain attitude
00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:23.000 So like I say if I say your name you say yes sir don't say what don't say like that
00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:27.000 Say when I say your name you say yes sir and he's like okay, you know
00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:31.000 No role play like okay, so next time it happens I expect you to do that kind of
00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:36.000 Think but I said no, no, we're going to go through it this practice so I do it like two times
00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:40.000 Took like what 30 seconds not even 30 seconds now every single time
00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:44.000 But I got to say it in a certain tone, but still it's in his head now
00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:49.000 You know because he's sort of been there zoom's in rather than just some idea on a paper or out of my mouth
00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:53.000 Whatever yeah, the value of role play is equivalent to the value of rolling in jjitsu
00:39:53.000 --> 00:40:00.000 Sparring essentially what sparring is just playing with additional motivations of course, but yeah
00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:06.000 I mean that's really the story that you're letting with is what we were talking about earlier is everything we did at top
00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:11.000 And it was role play because nothing was live you're not fighting against your real enemy and our problem is it
00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:16.000 We were role playing against somebody who wasn't good enough to make it better and like hey I'm doing everything right
00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:24.000 I'm winning and that meant I was going to but the role play the other person in that role play wasn't wasn't role playing a
00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:27.000 Hard enough situation for us to be effective
00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:29.000 Yeah
00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:31.000 And just like jjitsu you want to
00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:39.000 Yeah role play against the best possible opponent you can look can you over do that yes, you can if all you do is just get smoked and I bet you guys at top
00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:45.000 Conest instructors had to back off all the time and we had dialed we did we dialed by design and we knew what we were doing
00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:52.000 But ultimately you there has to be someplace where the role play isn't designed just so you can win the role play is designed so you can be challenged correctly
00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:59.000 And then you know we're going to talk about adaptation but the more effective your counterpart is the more you have to adapt the less effective
00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:04.000 They are the more you can just stick to your plan and you win and that's a really bad lesson is like I just keep doing what I'm doing
00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:08.000 I'm going to be okay. Yeah, the more effective your opponent is the more pressure you put on your brain
00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:12.000 It's right and the better results you're going to guess the more money learn. It's going to shake out of your hair
00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:20.000 Is there learning environments there's not a single correct design for creating the ideal learning environment because each learning objective
00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:31.000 Marine team and condition will differ therefore Marines modify learning environment to most effectively meet their the learners needs and reflect the conditions that they expect to encounter
00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:45.000 Effective learning requires environments that foster flexibility of thought reasoning and the creation of the potential solutions to the problems and encourages Marines to explore alternative courses of action
00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:58.000 I had to highlight that part because effective learning requires environments that foster flexibility of thought reasoning and the creation of potential
00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:03.000 So that so if at top gone what you did was said
00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:11.000 Okay, Bill on this run you're going to go up you're going to do this maneuver this maneuver this maneuver this maneuver this maneuver this maneuver
00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:18.000 And you're going to do them in this required timeline like you could create some false pressure with the required timeline they would get good at doing this maneuver this maneuver
00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:29.000 And then as soon as a real thing happened and they got a wrench thrown into order you came out of it. You just annihilate them same thing as you did so or the old school
00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:40.52 The cutters if right that cutters in whatever traditional martial arts here's the move you know there's a downward frosting blow from your opponent you do the
00:42:40.52 --> 00:42:56.000 Ex block and then whatever you do these coordinated moves which is what made those type of martial arts when you have see started or when they were doing NHB in in Brazil or Valley 2-Doh in Brazil
00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:11.000 Then the traditional martial arts that had been not learning in this way not learning for flexibility of thought and reasoning and creation of potential and what they didn't train for that they trained for a downward frosting whatever
00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:17.000 And when they got an upper cut or a leg kick that they did not work against they were dead in the water
00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:25.000 Same thing with when I was training what was what the seals that's how we train the seals we're not training hey here's the here's the
00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:31.000 Here's the here's the here's the next maneuver that you're going to do is call bay a center peel
00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:38.000 Now walk down the ravine and when the whistle blows you guys do a center peel actually that's how we start off right that's the beginning
00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:47.000 And I'm sure there's maneuvers you guys taught a topic hey here's the maneuver here's what you do yes but eventually you got to figure out what maneuver you're going to do when you're going to do it how long you're going to do it for what's your next maneuver going to be
00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:54.000 Yeah, and what little change is you're going to make to that maneuver in real time because it's not going to be the road application of that maneuver you learn
00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:56.000 It's going to be a variation of that
00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:02.000 Trying to expand people's brains and
00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:11.000 Effective learning in back to the book and effective learning environment enables marines to clearly understand the intended war fighting doctrine concepts tactics techniques procedures and learning outcomes
00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:14.000 It clearly identifies the expectation for the learners
00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:22.000 Whether exercising marines critical thinking in problem solving skills or understanding circumstances where a medi'd obedience to orders or
00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:31.000 Application of specific basic skills such as good marksmanship are required so there's times where you are going to just straight up say Roger that got it
00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:36.000 And then there's times where you're going to have to push back or get creative
00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:46.000 Additionally effective learning environments provide opportunities for marines to execute the required repetitions under different conditions to achieve competency
00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:51.000 Have you ever read the book outliers
00:44:53.000 --> 00:45:05.000 Gladwell, yes, yes, so one of the things that one of the experiments that they go through in that book is there is they're training two groups of kids to throw a ball into a basket or something like that not a basketball, but just a ball into a basket
00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:13.000 And there's one group of kids that do it at varying distances five feet seven feet four feet three feet eight feet
00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:21.000 The other kids are just doing it at six feet every single time test day comes the baskets at six feet
00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:30.000 Guess who does better echo Charles the six feet people nope really yep. It's the people that had the variety of flexibility
00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:39.000 They trained and they were able to outperform. So that's counter-induitive right we think ages do the same thing that's why
00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:46.000 That's why like the multi-sport athlete has this extra capability and they tend to do well
00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:58.000 I just watched a documentary about different really successful athletes that that oftentimes not all the time often times the player that does the best is not the best
00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:09.000 The best baseball player is not the player that just played baseball. It's the player player that played football basketball and baseball and then when he was 14 he focused on baseball
00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:16.000 But he had all this different athletic training. He was more capable with his body and yes
00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:20.000 In moving his body through space
00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:29.000 With force. Oh, I had to go deep on that one. Yeah, first and foremost the learning environment focuses on the learner's needs enabling Marines to understand
00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:38.000 Develop and retain the necessary knowledge and competencies they will use in combat fast forward. Although marine strive for learning efficiencies
00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:44.000 Improving the learning environment does not necessarily mean making it more efficient
00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:52.000 For example, though rope memorization or reciting fast can be very efficient and useful for developing basic knowledge such as memorizing standing orders
00:46:52.000 --> 00:47:00.000 They are not effective methods for all learning effective learning often requires approaching material from different perspectives
00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:05.000 Applying information in context and explaining how why accents occurred in addition to what occurred
00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:10.000 How many times echo Charles have you heard me say
00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:19.000 You learn an arm lock from a different professor and from different angles it will make your arm lock better
00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:27.000 So if Dean Lister teaches you an arm lock he's going to show you a couple details if I teach it to you it's going to show you a different detail if Jeffy clever teaches it to you
00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:31.000 It's going to be an even different detail and each one of those different
00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:42.000 Left, these different perspectives is going to make you better then if you when you learn the arm lock from the mount, but then you also learn it from the guard
00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:47.000 Both the arm lock from the guard and the arm lock from the mount both to get better
00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:51.000 Yes, many times yeah many times better
00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:54.000 So
00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:56.000 Learning from different perspectives
00:47:56.000 --> 00:48:01.000 Important tool important tool you got to have
00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:04.000 Fast forward
00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:10.000 Setting the conditions for success recognizing these surfaces and gaps requires awareness
00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:20.000 Honesty and judgment because they are often unique to the individual or the specific unit a surface in one learner or unit may be a gap in another
00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:30.000 It is incumbent upon leaders and instructors learners and their peers to actively seek out these gaps through continuous and aggressive reconnaissance
00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:45.000 Learners should not hide gaps in their knowledge instead they should exercise intellectual humility to identify and fill these gaps in order to improve
00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:51.000 Intellectual humility
00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:53.000 That's huge man
00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:54.000 Yes sir
00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:58.000 That is not easy to do
00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:01.000 To infern your peers especially if you're in charge
00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:05.000 If you're like the leader of a team or an organization or even the instructor
00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:13.000 Which you know my time at Top Gun anything I can think of where I was the leader of the team that intellectual humility
00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:17.000 We call that a brutally honest self assessment
00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:21.000 Yeah, and what's interesting is that
00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:30.000 If you think if you're not going to be humble and you're not going to admit your mistakes you're going to look stronger to your troops you're completely and utterly wrong
00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:32.000 Yeah
00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:36.000 Yeah, that when you say it's not easy to do
00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:46.000 If it's not easy to do and you choose subconscious your consciously you choose not to do it actually intellectual humility that is and you choose to hide your gaps
00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:50.000 What's the called surfaces gaps gaps gaps in the knowledge
00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:59.000 If you choose to hide your gaps in knowledge and you and that's sort of the way you are that's just how you get good at hiding the gaps and then you become
00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:10.000 Essentially successful at hiding the gaps then you get that so that will stunt your learning in that way the how it's it I mean actively yes, but it makes it harder and harder and harder as you go on
00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:15.000 Yeah, you know, so because the more you hide your gaps and the more you're committed to hiding the gaps
00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:19.000 The more like when you get start to get exposed or you're gonna hide your gaps
00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:22.000 Yeah, and also you can only hide your gaps for so long
00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:27.000 I mean people recognize it when you don't have that part of your game
00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:30.000 It's not like people don't know it man
00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:37.000 Yeah, and I'm thinking you get 200% where you know those guys where it's like man what they don't want to roll with certain guys
00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:41.000 You know like it's everyone sees it everyone sees what you're doing
00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:51.000 Marines mitigate weaknesses by leveraging their strengths to form new understanding and focus on learning to eliminate gaps
00:50:51.000 --> 00:51:01.000 This can only occur when learners first acknowledge their weaknesses and resolve to leverage their strengths to build meaningful connections
00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:14.000 Should we make a poster that says that you know I mean like just so important and so seemingly obvious and once again
00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:19.000 You wonder why someone would have to take something so seemingly obvious and put it into a book
00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:23.000 It's because even though it's seemingly obvious it's hard for people to do
00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:31.000 Next section is called the expeditionary nature of learning
00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:35.000 Marines recognize that to be effective war fighters
00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:37.000 They must be warrior scholars
00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:44.000 They must seize initiative to study the profession of arms whenever and wherever learning opportunities arise
00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:52.000 And once again, I like I like how the the Marine Corps manuals just state things as a matter of fact
00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:59.000 If you're a Marine then you obviously recognize that you need to be a warrior scholar. That's just how it is
00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:05.000 Now that goes into a little subsection here
00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:18.000 And it's talking about force on force exercises to simulate wars complexity force on force exercises are purpose driven learning environments that are approximate the complexity of war
00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:26.000 When developing such exercises Marines focus on designs that enhance problem solving and promote decision forcing events
00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:32.000 This enables Marines to practice and better understand how to get inside the enemies decision making process
00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:37.000 There is no substitute for fighting against a competent realistic thinking adaptive enemy
00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:45.000 Even if that enemy is simulated by other Marines this practice ensures that challenging learning environments provide a place to practice
00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:50.000 Develop experience allow errors adapt and learn how to fight and win
00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:56.000 That's the very premise of top gun need this to say
00:52:56.000 --> 00:53:05.000 That is the very premise of top gun that is the very premise of the advanced seal training where you are in fact fighting against other seals all the time
00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:08.000 And what's
00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:16.000 What might be hard for people to grasp and you might even be able to have a more linear exposure to this
00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:21.000 I could watch a young seal officer
00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:26.000 Get better at decision making events
00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:32.000 I could watch a young seal get better at being in chaotic situations
00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:38.000 Taking a step back, detaching, looking around, figuring out what the possibilities are, choosing a course of action, executing it
00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:41.000 I could watch someone get better at that
00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:44.000 It's hard to
00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:49.000 It can be hard to quantify what that
00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:53.000 Like what that actually looks like but I'm telling you I'm trying to tell you what it looks like
00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:55.000 It looked like this why I think you might be able to give a better example
00:53:56.000 --> 00:54:00.000 You'd see a young seal day one going through land warfare training
00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:03.000 And or day his first
00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:05.000 We'll call it field training exercise
00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:12.000 Or his first immediate action drill in an uncontrolled environment where he doesn't know what the call that he's going to make is
00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:18.000 Pertrolling out there, boom the targets pop up the simulator start going off
00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:25.000 His people react and the first time it happens to him he's totally overwhelmed
00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:29.000 Doesn't know what decision to make he's shooting his gun he's looking around
00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:33.000 But not with any purpose no call gets made eventually the platoon chief goes
00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:35.000 He'll be right or whatever
00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:40.000 Then you know you're debrief him you go hey what were you thinking about when the shooting started
00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:43.000 Well, I saw that target out ahead of us okay what else did you see?
00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:48.000 You didn't see anything else did you?
00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:54.000 No, I didn't see anything else okay cool next time
00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:56.000 I don't want you to even chew your gun
00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:57.000 Okay
00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:05.000 Same thing happens now at least the debrief he says yeah, I kind of saw that I saw that little piece of terrain we could get by
00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:12.000 That that seemed to be a good spot and then chief made the call milk. Okay, so you're your your eyes opened up a little bit more
00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:18.000 And this continues down the road until finally he can actually make a decision on his own in these pressure environments
00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:27.000 So you can watch someone get put into the chaos and get better at handling it over time
00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:29.000 What did it look like at top of them similar?
00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:37.000 Yeah, very similar and what I was actually thinking with that is when you're talking about the progression is the end of the progression
00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:42.000 You know we'd go through this multi-plane environment, which is I think more replicates what you were doing
00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:51.000 Not just the one against one, but multiple friendly aircraft and multiple enemy aircraft and it appears as if the enemy could give you any number of an infinite number of
00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:56.000 Possibles options to attack us, but we actually didn't do that we had not quite scripted
00:55:56.000 --> 00:56:05.000 But some of the basic formations of basic ways we wanted them to do it and at the beginning of those phases the student leaders would come back and just be like completely overwhelmed and by the end
00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:14.000 They wouldn't be they'd be and they would ask hey, what are you doing so what's so much different about these last runs I've been doing well and you're like nothing nothing
00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:21.000 And it's when they you would see them starting to see what's happening and then their minds are thinking wow
00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:26.000 They're dialing it back or they're making and we weren't changing anything but that they were able to see that time was slowing down
00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:36.000 Their decisions would make more sense and they'd ask the question of hey what change and like hey man nothing change here what you're able to do now is see and so the parallels there
00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:48.000 Amazing how similar are those two situations are and it also goes to show how much more thinking I have to put into how we were doing the training and where at fits elsewhere other than just making pilots ready to go to war
00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:51.000 Yeah, I would get asked the same question
00:56:51.000 --> 00:57:01.000 Hey, thanks for back and off tonight. I'd be like hey, thank you for using utilizing decentralized command and letting your subordinate leaders go on the assault
00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:17.000 Yeah, go on the attack go on the offense because when you do that my guys are pinned down. They can't do anything you know how many guys I had tonight out of out fighting you how many four you know how many had last night four you know how many had the night before four no change in the number of opt for you're going against
00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:25.000 What's what's changing is your ability to lead is your your team your subordinate leaders ability to step up and make things happen
00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:35.000 Your ability to give good guidance your ability to make decisions your ability for your team members to make good decisions because that's the other thing that makes it really drastic is as
00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:52.000 Eight fire team leaders all of a sudden you know when when they show up two of them are kind of proactively making things happen and then it becomes three and then it becomes four and then it becomes five and then it becomes six out of eight fire team leaders are proactively getting after it
00:57:52.000 --> 00:58:04.000 It's going to be hard to contain and that's when I would have to step up I wouldn't back off. I would step up my trade at guys. I'd be like, okay, hey, we need to bring it. We need four more guys. We need to put somebody over here and we try and screw them over
00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:22.000 But we wouldn't be able to beat a good task unit with good decentralized command with simple calls doing cover move prior we couldn't we couldn't beat him you could not beat that right so you can get better at this stuff.
00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:37.000 Fast forward a little bit. Marines guard against complacency because they know that their adversaries are always watching what the Marines are doing and they are constantly making changes to adapt in an attempt to defeat us.
00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:46.000 If Marine settle for what they think is good enough it may result in high-cathlete rates for the next fight.
00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:55.000 Marines just FYI are not complacent next question.
00:58:55.000 --> 00:59:12.000 A learner centric model this is the next section is called a learner centric model. The learner centric model ensures that content is relevant to learners actively engaging and challenging Marines in a positive instructional climate.
00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:29.000 For example, discussions on problem solving between the learners and leaders and instructors are an effective method to motivate learners and build teams as they analyze information, consider alternatives and work together to develop a solution to the problem that's posed on them.
00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:58.000 Now I am going to venture to guess that some of this section is aimed at an old philosophy of training which existed in the military well I definitely existed in the SEAL teams which is hey we're going we're here you're going to do what we tell you to do if you don't do exactly what we tell you to do it's because you're all screwed up.
00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:10.000 And you need to do it what the way we showed you which does not promote this whole idea of thinking and learning and developing.
01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:15.000 You know hey you you you you you enter that room wrong.
01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:30.000 This is probably one of the first little. First little things that I noticed as I'm peeling back my career when I was at team one.
01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:44.000 And I was I would be instructing and I was never the lead instructor but I go out we'd be doing some close quarter combat training and someone would do something.
01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:58.000 Make a decision and some of the instructors some of the more old school instructors would say something along the lines of you went left that was wrong.
01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:12.000 Hey why did you go left and they'd say well when I approached the door I looked at the hinges I could see which way it was going to open and I thought it would be the quickest way and you go okay.
01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:28.000 Here's the thing and maybe there's a rebel that maybe there's a hey listen you wait just you know you can't you can't presume that because you saw this that's going to happen maybe it's the wrong but maybe you go okay.
01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:49.000 And I used to say to guys hey you did what you did you did what you did look you're going to be going in the house as you've never been in before that's the whole goal of this that you can go in a room you've never been before and you're going to react how you react we need to understand why you're reacting that way if it's if there's a better way to do it let's think about it.
01:01:49.000 --> 01:02:04.000 But let's not. X out what you did as if this was the wrong thing by the way you don't get a second chance in combat you did you whatever you just did you just did and now you got to deal with it.
01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:17.000 Think about from a leadership standpoint to what actually helps that person more than you could do something like jacca that was wrong.
01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:37.000 You actually made do it the way I told you to do it maybe you will maybe you won't maybe you're just stubborn you're gonna not but you're going to just do what you do.
01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:47.000 You're going to get you're going to get you're going to do that but just by asking the question and you and I almost knew what you're going to say was hey just tell me why you did that it doesn't mean that they're still right.
01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:56.000 But it means that you actually want to understand what they were thinking and if you understand what they're thinking it's so much easier to train and work with them that if you're just trying to force them into what you want them to do.
01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:07.000 That's incredible is this section captures that whole thought process in the title of the section a learner centric model so if you're a trainer you're an instructor.
01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:25.000 So often people set up instruction as if it's around me right this instruction around me hey this is how you doing arm lock right this is how you do watch me and then do what I just did instead of hey let me see your arm lock you know does this Dean Lister.
01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:32.000 You do something and when we were at camp up in Maine people would say hey.
01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:47.000 Pete so awesome and I'd be like oh why they'd say he was he came from across the room so giant mat space thousands of square feet of mat with a hundred people on it and they'd say he came from across the room.
01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:57.000 Hey I see where you're putting your foot on this position and it'd be better if you'd move it four inches over here to the right try it and then it would work.
01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:12.000 So it's learner centric it's not about Dean it's actually about the students and that's a Dean's very good at that it's fully it's fully about the learner it's a learner centric model.
01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:33.000 The Marine but I think I think that there is an old school mentality of instruction in the Marine Corps possibly I was never in the Marine Corps but I did go through multiple training events with the Marine Corps and I definitely saw some instructor centric models.
01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:43.000 And I think actually Dean dealt with some instructor centric models Dean went up to do some combat and training with the Marine Corps and the instructors were there.
01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:56.000 And instead of them being like okay well how would you do this Dean Lister multiple time world champion did you do how would you do a rear naked choke and said they were saying we do it like this.
01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:04.000 And Dean said okay try that on me guess what there's some holes in the plan.
01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:08.000 Check.
01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:24.000 Next section self and the caveat haven't thrown it out there yet no I'm not reading this whole entire book we're skipping big chunks you can get it yourself it's free it's online it's PDF you can download it the Marine Corps is very generous with their knowledge.
01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:36.000 Next section self directed learning like mission tactics self directed learning benefits the leader and instructor by giving the learner more ownership and autonomy.
01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:47.000 Which enables the leader or instructor to focus on learners who need more help or to explore alternate ways to improve the learning environment.
01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:59.000 The commander leader instructor or mentor agrees to provide the learners with the necessary support and guidance to help them accomplish their missions without unnecessarily prescribing their actions.
01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:02.000 Oh these Angela's command.
01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:09.000 We we want you to know how to do this we want you to take ownership of what you learned.
01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:12.000 Why because then you're going to be more invested in it.
01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:19.000 Just.
01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000 Good to go.
01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:24.000 Vicarious experiences critical because even the most realistic training experiences in military education fall short of the reality of combat.
01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:28.000 Therefore the more vicarious experience that a marine obtains.
01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:35.000 It the less likely that a new experience in combat or otherwise will be completely unique yes you cannot simulate everything.
01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:40.000 I used to joke about this if trade it I would say.
01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:46.000 Unfortunately I can't just shoot you guys you know and they laugh because we do everything else.
01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:55.000 I was standing with the commanding officer of a sealed team as one of his seal task units was out in the.
01:06:55.000 --> 01:07:07.000 Out in the desert in the Imperial Valley of California and there was total may I'm going on and we both have radio is on were listening to all the calls getting made their strobes going off.
01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:11.000 There's there's explosions going off there's communication.
01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:22.000 We're just all this is happening and it's we have the perfect view there's guys on the rich and we're looking at like a bowl.
01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:28.000 A valley and then guys are up on the ridge lines and you can see them all from our vantage point.
01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:36.000 And I just looked at him I said there is no better training in the world for a guy's been what these guys are you so realistic it was so.
01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:40.000 So crazy.
01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:51.000 But my point was even with that there was things that you can't simulate you there's things that you cannot simulate and so you have to use these.
01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:57.000 Vicarious experiences so that people can learn.
01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:05.000 Continuing on Marines can use mental imagery to gain confidence prior to executing a skill emphasize key points in after action to reviews.
01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:17.000 Examine possible outcomes of decisions and explor options mental imagery also provides an effective mission rehearsal technique when using mental imagery a leader pictures himself or herself in the operation.
01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:30.000 Vividly visualizes different scenarios including possible branches and sequels and rehearses the decisions he or she may make given specific conditions and enemy actions this way.
01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:40.000 The leader mentally prepares for multiple potential enemy actions and reduces the possibility of surprise when the enemy reacts now.
01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:43.000 What you're trying to do is close the gap.
01:08:43.000 --> 01:09:04.000 Between how hard you can train and what it's really going to be like right and you can look you cannot fully get there you can't fully get there there's emotions that you cannot trigger unless someone is about could die right now right in jetzu right there's.
01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:28.000 You train for mma not even jzu mma we can throw punches we can grapple we can exhaust them we can do all these things but you can't have them walking into the octagon of the ufc even if you and I used it like we when we used to spore we stood on Saturdays when there's a crowd here get the crowd to start commenting you can do all those things.
01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:52.000 But that last little thing you cannot simulate you cannot simulate and so you want to build up you want to close that gap as much as possible part of it is through the training part of it is through these vicarious experiences and reading and learning about it but there was a guy on the uf online today saying hey I understand that I'm supposed to detach but there comes a point when it starts happening and I.
01:09:52.000 --> 01:10:04.000 How do I get ready for that yeah. And the thing was I the advice I gave him I was a little let's say I was a little nervous about the advice I gave this guy.
01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:22.000 Because I was saying hey you need to set yourself up for surprise things that you're not ready for you actually want to tell like if I want to get ready to defend myself and not freak out I need to tell echo hey man occasionally I want you to just attack me.
01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:34.000 And here's where you got to be careful if you do that let's say you go okay all right I got this and you start tracking on me and one night at vans.
01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:50.000 You know I'm out there getting some picking up some steak and you I get into my car or whatever I'm getting in my car you spring out of somewhere and start yelling and screaming with a knife in your hand to see how I react and next thing you know you got to shit to to gunshots to the head.
01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:54.000 Right and how am I going to explain that one away right it's going to be tough.
01:10:54.000 --> 01:11:00.000 Yes. So we got to be we got to do after put some parameters around it because I don't want to shoot you.
01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:06.000 Wait that's what is that essentially I mean obviously not the shooting thing but that's what that's what your answer was.
01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:16.000 Well what I said was listen you know talk to your wife and have your wife throw scenarios at you and then I had to give the same parameters because if you go imagine if you said and I said listen.
01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:28.000 But you want to practice being in these turbulent situations you have to be in them as close as you can get so I said if you tell your wife that say hey I want you to throw some just crazy stress at me.
01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:34.000 When you know and don't even do it to me today or tomorrow wait like a week till I really don't expect it.
01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:43.000 But then I told him hey you need to put some parameters around us right because his wife might come home and say his wife might come home and say I've decided to leave you.
01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:46.000 I think he goes good I was going to leave you anyway all the stuff.
01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:47.000 Yeah, all the stuff.
01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:48.000 All the stuff.
01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000 So we have to put parameters on it.
01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000 We have to think through it.
01:11:52.000 --> 01:12:00.000 But if you really want to to get someone used to being under stress that's what you do you put them under stress.
01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:06.000 That's what you do and it's hard to do that if you if someone knows it's a roleplay there's a little thing in the background of mine.
01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000 But if they don't.
01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:12.000 Hey you can you can create a lot of stress on someone.
01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:20.000 Yeah, if you fail that like those test scenarios that they spring out at you if you fail that test you can do some damage and you're really.
01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:21.000 That's what I'm saying.
01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:28.000 You're going to be going to be a little bit of thinking too man because what if yeah what if your wife says like essentially a fake.
01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:33.000 Yeah, like whatever I'm leaving you I'm mad at even like something small let's say okay.
01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:41.000 Hey you didn't take out that trash or whatever and just with a slight attitude what if I fail the test and it'd be like you snow my job I bring up something that actually does.
01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:49.000 Really in real life trigger her a little just a little bit for sure. She's playing the role, but a what if she can't detach either you know which is normal.
01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:53.000 And now it just escalates from there and there which started to be a test now.
01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:54.000 Man, relationship.
01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:57.000 It's like the office the fire test with.
01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000 It's right right.
01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:04.000 It's supposed to be a test now we got people throw copy machines out the window.
01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:11.000 Yeah, it's a military we grew up with something called and I assume you got the same thing we had something called the training time out.
01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:23.000 So, in this scenario like they'd brief the okay we're going to go do this training and if something happens that you exceed a threshold of whatever you put your hands up on a tea or you put your arm up and say time out and then we'll stop the drill.
01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:26.000 We're just going to like rudimentary training you do that and so.
01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:29.000 Kind of always knew in the back of your mind like okay.
01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:32.000 This could get bad, but if it gets too bad I can stop the training.
01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:45.000 What would be certain or what what would be like an example of my recollection of the first time that I was briefed on the training time out was during like the first week of TBS where we do swim call.
01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:59.000 The first thing you do swim call yeah the water is hey look if you know where there's five instructors there's 40 dudes in a put to and we're watching you but if you get to a place where you or you can't handle this you can throw the hands up and we'll see that will stop the training.
01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:11.000 So you can introduce this concept early on and then you know as you evolved in in fighter aviation we have the knock it off which is actually kind of like in someone is kind of like tapping so I can do this fight with you and we're finally if I get to a point where I feel like.
01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:20.000 I've reached a limit like I don't think this is safe anymore I can't keep doing this or whatever I can say knock it off and you will stop training you will stop being the aggressor say.
01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:30.000 But you don't get to do that in combat there is no training time out there is no knock it off but it's impossible for any training scenario to remove that thing of hey if your life is now at risk.
01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:38.000 There is no training situation that we would love that to happen we would never get to a place where you're going to get hurt or killed to prove a point.
01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:51.000 But you actually kind of know that subconsciously and so that limit is there that's the gap that's the gap that's right the gap is when you've got a platoon of guys and they're receiving.
01:14:51.000 --> 01:15:04.000 Enemy fire air quote enemy fire and one of the guys just gets up and charges you know the bad guy and it's great and he happens to get him or whatever but.
01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:22.000 And it goes both ways too because I used to explain that's what evens it out for our training what evens it out is the bad guys the up my up for they don't care if they die either because they they're going to get reset and we'll go again.
01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:35.000 But actually the mousha had been often didn't care if they died and so they have an advantage there we care about our friends we care about our comrades and arms so we're going to fight a different way than the mousha.
01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:56.000 And that's just they don't care not all the time but that's a part of their mindset is hey if I die that's cool martyrdom case they would have suicide missions yes I we don't do that we don't really like hey the look you're going to die on this one I want to talk about the plane we don't do that no and they would have they would do that actually all the time yeah and that and that.
01:15:56.000 --> 01:16:08.000 The I think the point by this there are things that you simply cannot replicate and that's that's one of them not just the risk to your own life that you're going to mitigate but the willingness of the other person to have no regard for that.
01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:13.000 Yeah which is something it's hard you cannot get that gap will always persist until you experience it for the first time.
01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:35.000 Yeah and then you got to try and close that gap to the best of your ability and the way you do that is different instructors different angles and then as I talk about here vicarious living vicarious experience hey tell me what that was like from you and there's a chance that you go you know what oh I know what I remember this guy remember this I've seen this before.
01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:43.000 This whole book starts off with Matt is saying hey you shouldn't be surprised by anything you should have read about it there's no thing that you can't see something like that before.
01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:53.000 Which is what they're going for all right so going back to the book here go back the if to rewind a little bit so the whole test about the guy that you're.
01:16:53.000 --> 01:17:05.000 I'm giving advice to the you know okay have yourself tested what have you tested put yourself in the pressure scenarios yeah for detachment practice essentially.
01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:05.000 So.
01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:13.000 I think first I think those should always be at a level one that's I think just for safe if that's your meaning we don't want we don't want.
01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:23.000 I'll try to catch to hydroshots to the great yeah bonds parking lot yeah so I'm threatening my state.
01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:29.000 So if you're weak or let's say detaching in moments like that or part of your maybe weakness will say which is why.
01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:40.000 I'm actually a question for the training right so it is a weakness so we got to figure there's some possibility that I'm not going to detach I'm not going to see that you and I'm just cracking off my rounds.
01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:52.000 So yeah so I think level one to I don't know this is my been but I think part of or it's the very least the beginning of the answer to someone with that kind of like a detachment kind of weakness or whatever.
01:17:52.000 --> 01:18:00.000 Is the leadership primer you call it yes okay so before you even said the word leadership primer.
01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:13.000 I would essentially prime myself by doing this and a lot of people do do this they'll like tell me this they'll be like what would jacco do in the situation like anytime a stressful situation came up or decision had to be made they'll be like oh what would jacco do.
01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:18.000 In fact also make sure this is what would jacco do kind of thing and like yeah.
01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:30.000 So essentially thought the same thing but not what would jacco do but more like hey I'm the leader so what should the leader do right now you know it's like or and so along with being the leader is it's your responsibility.
01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:47.000 You can you cannot it's against life rules to blame anyone else you have to take 100% of the blame and come up with 100% of the solution if someone helps you good but you have to come with 100% of the solution right now even if you're being attacked and feeling under appreciated blood blood 100% up to you.
01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:51.000 To cut to to manufacture a good outcome right.
01:18:51.000 --> 01:19:10.000 So so that's essentially what would jacco do right that's like the press well I would essentially prime myself like if something some stressful situation that's the rule like any stress that comes in some bigger small boom I'm the leader you just you have to essentially prime yourself into being like the leader and what's hard is.
01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:21.000 Is being primed right because you're you're not walking around like that it takes a long time to develop the instinct of your very first reaction your initial reaction.
01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:32.000 Is detached take a step back and take a breath and make sure you understand what's happening that's a really hard thing to train in yourself it's a really hard thing to train yourself so.
01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:47.000 For the leadership primer which again this is the F online we got this thing called the leadership primer where you you know you can just press play leadership leadership primer it's me saying hey this is what you think about this and it just gets you in the leadership mindset because.
01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:58.000 If you're there already that's one less step you have to say hey if I tell you hey echo you're going to walk in that room and you're going to get no fight.
01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:07.000 If I tell you that there's a guy waiting to fight you in that room you are going to do eight times better than if you just walk into that room thinking about you know getting sushi.
01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:10.000 Right you're going to do eight times better minimal.
01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:22.000 You're going to be ready you're going to be primed you're going to be thinking you're going to be looking for an exit you're going to be looking for an entrance you're going to see what is we're going to size up your target all that's going to happen the second you walk in there if you're not expecting it all it doesn't happen at all.
01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:29.000 So getting yourself thinking that way is absolutely important and you know I'll take this whole thing one step further.
01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:36.000 The idea of like what what would jocou do I get it as like a leadership primer.
01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:45.000 You actually have to ask yourself one level deeper than that which is for lack of a better way of explaining it.
01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:57.000 What would jocou actually do right now because the surface answer of what would jocou do is like oh you just beat tf through this right that's the surface answer.
01:20:57.000 --> 01:21:12.000 It's not the real answer and that's the difference and I did a bad job sometimes in the teams of guys that worked with me but they didn't they got the surface jocou but they didn't get the next level and so they.
01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:16.000 Go overseas and have to report to some army.
01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.000 Some army major that.
01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:26.000 They didn't get along with and they think what would jocou do jocou would tell this guy better straight himself out no and actually that's the wrong answer.
01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:36.000 Jocou would actually develop an awesome relationship with this guy get to know him really well and start planning seeds in his head where we ran everything that's what jocou would do so it's a little bit.
01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:43.000 Deeper than that you have to go next level before we end up priming ourselves for.
01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:52.000 Hey if it's just like this if if I said okay echo when you go in this room someone's going to get attack you and you walk in first person you see you punch him in the face.
01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:56.000 And it ends up being whatever.
01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000 Someone that didn't serve right.
01:21:58.000 --> 01:21:59.000 That's a problem.
01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:03.000 Yeah you were overly primed and you didn't really think through the problem.
01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:07.000 So there's a there's another level there that you got to go.
01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:10.000 Yeah but to your point correct.
01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:22.000 How can you get yourself primed you know I talk about leadership strategy and tactics there's a list of 12 things to do as a leader and like look you can't read this list of 12 things to be like okay good cool now.
01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:31.000 No if you're a new leader and you check in before you go into the meeting with your subordinate or with your leader you just take a look take three minutes and read through the thing to be like all right.
01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:40.000 I'm thinking the right way. I've got my mind primed for what I'm going to go make happen right now and when somebody blames me for something instead of going actually my fault at all.
01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:41.000 It said you go.
01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:45.000 Yeah okay like you know let me get out my notebook and actually write down what you're saying.
01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:46.000 Yeah.
01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:51.000 So I can make sure I can get it fixed because I don't want to be the person that's responsible for making mistakes.
01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:55.000 But I'm ready to take it on and fix it boom.
01:22:55.000 --> 01:23:05.000 Yeah and and of course just to be clear too like I'd by no means I'm saying people hey do this this is what all you got to do or not all you got it this way you got to do.
01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:10.000 After some of what we're talking to I'm not like advocating that at all.
01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:24.000 I'm saying that is a different way of explaining what I would do and it's so it wasn't like what would you go do it was what would like the leader quote unquote leader do and I used you as a reference and here's the thing I know you're second and.
01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:31.000 Even sometimes third level like I know I think I do anyway it's been effective with.
01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.000 Behaving like I do put it away.
01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:47.000 So to me I just worked on being that way the whole time 100% at the time because it's easier to like deprive than it is to like prime one year like laid on the priming kind of thing situation in one of the situation arises you know.
01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:57.000 Yeah and here's where all this is hard right all this is hard is that.
01:23:57.000 --> 01:24:07.000 There's a gap that you got to be able to fill that's that's what this is all about the gap is I'm I can get primed for so much I can think about what I'm going to do and how I'm going to act and I'm going to make this call and if somebody confronts my ego I'm going to detach but then.
01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:17.000 The person that you didn't expect to confront your ego the person that you didn't expect to say a nasty comment to you that happens and before you can get.
01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:26.000 Think through it you go well who you even be called out someone with what you did last quarter and all of a sudden we've got an escalation on our hands.
01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:36.000 So how do you get ready for that the answer is you do these training scenarios and you as much as you can you say look.
01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:42.000 Hey Dave I've been having a problem losing my temper with people can you do me favor and just put me through some temper tests.
01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:50.000 Yeah now look we got to put some safety parameters about it because I don't want to save the save the save the save says Dave says you know.
01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:58.000 Hey Jocco this is a good example for you to set an echelon front if you're not even submitting this paperwork on time and I go.
01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:08.000 Well you're looking even at echelon front Dave I don't even know why you're here and all of a sudden we have a real bra.
01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:14.000 About this right so let's put some control parameters in place I know and then immediately Dave called the creative time out because it's about to get you know we're about to do.
01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:27.000 So if you throw everything under the bus why because you was role playing so yes you got to put parameters around it but other than that like if you want to see how you're going to react.
01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:45.000 No hydrish locks to your friends chest because they surprise you trying to steal your steak.
01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:49.000 You know who tries to get me to take some kind of a training time out.
01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:57.000 Yeah see and that's the thing and that's a whole rabbit hole to bread there's so many ways to do that to call for a training time because.
01:25:57.000 --> 01:26:15.000 Injutsu it's like sure there is the training time out straight up like hey that's one of them oh yeah like you can let's say I'm I'm you know maybe kind of injured or maybe just a super you know let's say I'm a smaller person less like physical capability against a crazy you know 21 year old.
01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:29.000 235 pound white belt spas right I can call a training time out I can be like hey like I respect you but this seems like kind of dangerous I'm not kind of training with you specific that's a training time out really.
01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:46.000 You know you're going to have a high level you just to put your out of shape and you're going with the monster guy who's who's really good at you to get in the better you you're guessing you're like you're getting you can beat down is what and you kind of don't like that you can call it a little training time out.
01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:58.000 The here's where the subtlety kind of arise you can like fake an injury you can be like oh like oh my finger was caught in your shirt your shorts or something to give you like.
01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:05.000 And again it's a spectrum you can get like maybe 10 seconds training time out think about can do or you can give yourself maybe like a minute or guys used to do.
01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:15.000 I remember rolling with a guy and he was a higher belt than me and I wasn't shaped I wasn't better than him but I was a guy kept going going going any kept like we're doing key and he kept like.
01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:23.000 Coach take no no he take time to tie his belt again and like bro where are you and bro our belts fly off you just keep training right.
01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:35.000 He kept like to and the kind like flagrantly taking like 20 30 seconds to tie his belt they did like six times that's a training time out to the only thing about I think a training time out.
01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:45.000 Is is known and the right side like a training time out you're talking about little tactics little sneaky little tactics to catch a breath.
01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:57.000 I'd rather catch a breath over here so it's a little bit different but there are I mean tapping out as kind of a training time out.
01:27:57.000 --> 01:28:06.000 Yeah well a training time out would be like actually remember when used to be claustrophobic when you remember when used to be more claustrophobic.
01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:18.000 You would kind of you're training time out was I look I didn't have a submission on you at all but you would tap out and to say I there was a guy when I was at team two that I used to train with and he would get so mad.
01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:21.000 And he would just go.
01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:27.000 He would just be just get off me and then I'd get off me like go.
01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:37.000 He would be so like mad at me as a person.
01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:44.000 When you would make it known that you were trying to make me claustrophobic it'd be less claustrophobic.
01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:55.000 The most claustrophobic I would get from you is one like you'd be pinning me down and it seemed like this was part of your like tactic to like slowly submit me like.
01:28:55.000 --> 01:29:05.000 I'd have this feeling like I'm never going to get out of this like situation and I'm probably going to die under here kind of thing but if you're like one time this is what you did you were like.
01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:13.000 Oh you're better at your claustrophobic now watch it kind of you said something along these lines and then you put all your weight on and you put your feet on the wall.
01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:19.000 So all your weight was on me and you're essentially saying whatever we're using you're saying like yeah like how does that feel kind of thing.
01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:21.000 And I was like proud I'm not claustrophobic at all right now.
01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:28.000 You want to know why you are primed. I told you I was going to do it you were ready for it you were ready with the resist.
01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:36.000 Yeah and my mental state was kind of like this me gets you know if I'm against any claustrophobic situation like my mind that the battle is different.
01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:37.000 Yeah.
01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:39.000 Interesting that is interesting.
01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:42.000 Back to the book.
01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:54.000 Marines need time to reflect on new learning experience to exploit their lessons self reflection internalizes experience and increases mental preparedness for employment across the range of military operations.
01:29:54.000 --> 01:30:01.000 So you're going to think about what happened little thing about Madison here and then on to general Al Grey.
01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:15.000 And they're the sum of what it's saying about that they're saying Marines need to make time to reflect in order to build understanding exploit lessons and be ready to adapt to situations change.
01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:22.000 So you kind of have to debrief then you have to debrief yourself.
01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:33.000 Next section the role of the instructor regardless of the location of location or position marine instructors are knowledgeable skilled competent and confident in their abilities.
01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.000 Once again, this is a statement of fact.
01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:42.000 That's the way marine instructors are their knowledgeable skilled competent and competent in their abilities.
01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:45.000 Fast forward a little bit assessments.
01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:57.000 Assessments are employed to provide learners with constructive feedback so that they can further develop professionally rather than an arbitrary test score that does not capture growth or change.
01:30:57.000 --> 01:31:10.000 The most effective instructors use the coach teach mentor approach to provide learners with constructive feedback.
01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:19.000 You know, as we covered the code the evaluations and the protocols and I think I got asked somebody asked me.
01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:32.000 Would you recommend doing this in a company, you know, in a company and I'm like, yeah, the biggest problem with the Navy and the Marine Corps evaluation systems is that they're annual.
01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:45.000 So only coming out once a year, this idea here that you have to provide assessments more often than that. They don't necessarily need to be official, but you got to give people feedback.
01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:55.000 Fast forward learners and instructors like should understand that Marines learn because of their errors, not despite them.
01:31:55.000 --> 01:32:13.000 Isn't that a, isn't that a smart thing to think to yourself, is that my employees, my support, it's my kids echo Charles are going to learn because of their errors.
01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:20.000 Changes your mindset a little bit when the kids make a mistake, it's their turn to learn.
01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:33.000 Next section, technology and supportive learning. Just as MCDP one confirms that war is a human enterprise and that no amount of technology can reduce the human dimension.
01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:50.000 For learning environment is also primarily based on human characteristics rather than equipment. Technology can support expand an individual individualized learning. It is one of the many tools to support learning objectives. So look, it's it's a tool.
01:32:50.000 --> 01:33:03.000 Technology is a tool, but it doesn't replace the human element of learning. The conclusion here.
01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:21.000 Battle is the ultimate test of military learning and training as Marines will fight is a time honored Marine Corps principle train as you fight. In preparing for battle Marines leverage the art and science of learning along with helpful technologies to enhance learning environments.
01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:27.000 Taylor learning experiences and provide constructive feedback to accelerate learning.
01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:38.000 There you go. And now we get into the last section of this chapter for the learning leader.
01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:50.000 Hmm, it all just kind of comes together in this section for doesn't it the learning leader leadership and learning are indispensable to each other John F Kennedy.
01:33:50.000 --> 01:34:00.000 The future operating environment will place new demands on leaders at all levels are leaders must have the training education and experience to meet those demands.
01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:10.000 And that's general done for 36 common done of the Marine Corps and the 19th chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:26.000 And the last quote throughout history the difference between brilliant brilliantly performing armies and mediocre ones has always depended on a small handful of combat leaders.
01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:30.000 And that is Dave Berks friend John Boyd.
01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:35.000 Throughout history leadership has been the most important thing on the battlefield.
01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:38.000 Small handful of combat leaders.
01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:48.000 When you're in a in a what's it called when there's a whole bunch of airplane in the sky one of those all those airplanes together called.
01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:51.000 Is that like a squadron is that a is at a wing.
01:34:51.000 --> 01:35:04.000 So if you're going on a on a soul when you call all those aircraft together we'd call an air wing in the Navy and ring or and if you're going you would you go on a mission like I would go on a mission with a seal puttune you would go on a mission with an air wing.
01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:09.000 Everybody you'd be the air wing and there's smaller components of that you know you'd have like.
01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:15.000 Section division a section that's right you'd break them down much like you know fire team squad things like that.
01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:27.000 Is it true or is it is it also true in an air wing on an assault that a couple combat a couple good leaders good pilots can make a big difference that is true.
01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:30.000 Oh really absolutely.
01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:35.000 We're working together in pairs basically is that the smallest unit that we're working in.
01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:48.000 Yeah, despite the fact that there is an erling a there's a Marine Corps air you know madtuff an air wing component in the Navy has an air wing the most common formation that we go out there is a two sometimes a for ship but a two ship formation we call to this section.
01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:54.000 Is the most common warfighting element when things break down into individual implementation.
01:35:54.000 --> 01:36:02.000 And how many how many aircraft how many sections would you go out roll out on on a.
01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:11.000 On a mission that you would train for a top gun and the reason I'm saying that like I like when you talk about and you have multiple aircraft like sort of the FTX scenario the final training exercises.
01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:14.000 How many aircraft are going out how many sections.
01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:23.000 Top gun with the culmination of a top gun would be four sections be eight aircraft eight aircraft going out to assault the target then some some bogeys come out.
01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:29.000 A lot and they are going to try and bring it and so does the.
01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:33.000 Do the sections have a overall leader yes.
01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:38.000 If that guy's not quite as good, but there's a couple pipe hitters in there all the difference in the world all the difference in the world.
01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:44.000 I think all the same fundamentals that you've always talked about if you put them into.
01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:46.000 Leadership in the air it's exactly the same thing.
01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:54.000 It you do not have to be the mission commander to be the most influential leader in the formation.
01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:55.000 Logitech.
01:36:55.000 --> 01:37:01.000 When you go with the air wing to found Nevada.
01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:15.000 How many how many aircraft roll out on those mission now you're talking you know you could have 20 now you'd have much much bigger much more complex different missions all at the same time a lot more coordination 20 aircraft plus sometimes.
01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:29.000 And that's the carrier group going up to found to run big exercise is getting ready for deployment and a carrier group would be you know three full squadges a 12 you'd have a squadron of six you'd have a squadron of four you know you'd have 40 50 airplanes in an air wing.
01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:31.000 I did that trip.
01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:43.000 Three I did three strike group carrier interoperabilities and found yeah which is just so so lucky on my part as I was a rate for for two of my was ready.
01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:51.000 I mean for one of them I was the Jay assistant to commander but just the amount of visibility that gave me.
01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:57.000 Because it wasn't normal for seals to do that trip we would have a couple seals that or station up there.
01:37:57.000 --> 01:38:04.000 But we but to actually get up to be able to go up there and go in the field and do all the closer support very very healthy.
01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:11.000 Yeah we did some long patrols to from one end of that valley over to the other end.
01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:20.000 12 12 kilometers and a night lay up for the day recover a down pilot 12 kilometers back out the next night.
01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:23.000 Did you ever get to be the down pilot up there?
01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:24.000 No never did.
01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:25.000 I know exactly what you're talking about.
01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:28.000 I know you got to assign the down pilot.
01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:31.000 Because that guy had to walk half those.
01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:33.000 It was not a job most people would.
01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.000 Yeah they didn't seem to be chilling too.
01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:36.000 Isn't winter time?
01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:40.000 Yeah we did every air wing and every every course went through you to have a down pilot scenario.
01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:43.000 And you send a guy out there.
01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:48.000 Side track two things and two things in my time in the seal teams.
01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:54.000 Where I got to see something in nature that a normal person doesn't get to see.
01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:59.000 One of them locked out of a submarine in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.
01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:04.000 And it was it was the brightest blue is a daytime or a lunar rehearsal.
01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:06.000 It was the brightest blue.
01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:12.000 Most beautiful ocean and it was not it was incredible visibility.
01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:16.000 And there was like a pot of dolphins coming alongside of us and just swimming.
01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:17.000 That's number one.
01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:18.000 Number two.
01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:20.000 I'm in Fallen Nevada.
01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:22.000 I'm in a helicopter.
01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:25.000 And it's early spring.
01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:27.000 So there's still snow on the ground.
01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:31.000 And we're flying nap of the earth up through these hills.
01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:39.000 And we come across a pack of wild moustangs horses that are charging through the mountains.
01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:42.000 And we're we're we're so low close to them.
01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:46.000 And they're and we're like slightly above the tree line or whatever.
01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:48.000 I don't know if there's a tree line, but there's no trees.
01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:50.000 Very black shrubs and these things are just charged.
01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:52.000 It's big pack of wild moustangs.
01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:53.000 It was freaking epic.
01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:55.000 I want to cool things and I've ever seen.
01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:57.000 In nature that's one of the coolest things I've ever seen.
01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:59.000 All right.
01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:07.000 So leaders at all levels are responsible for their own learning while supporting their subordinates development.
01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:13.000 Each marine is either a leader or a future leader, whether by rank or by their experience and influence on other.
01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:16.000 You know, that's something I said at the early moustards.
01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:22.000 I think I said it every moustard, but that would say training is the solemn duty of the leaders.
01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:27.000 Because if you got some training command and they're not doing what they're supposed to do, you need to still do it.
01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:30.000 You need to make it happen. You're in charge of training.
01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:38.000 You're in charge of education. You're in charge of making sure people learn.
01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:43.000 An excellent way to master a topic is to endeavor to teach it well to other Marines.
01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:47.000 Marines can develop leadership skills and improve communication skills through learning.
01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:55.000 Marine succeed with leadership styles that provide clear intent through mission type orders and decentralized execution.
01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:58.000 We are in full support of this document.
01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:00.000 You want to get good at something, by the way? Teach it.
01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:07.000 Yeah. Teach it. Do you think your leadership capabilities improve since you got to ask your own front and you teach leadership?
01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:12.000 I wrote a note when I was going through this myself. I wrote down the word leading is teaching.
01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:16.000 I was just a note. I just put in the margins. I was just running through this document a couple of times.
01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:20.000 The answer to question is yes. I do.
01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:22.000 That is a...
01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:25.000 Yeah. So it's...
01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:28.000 You... just even though you describe it, it can be a little bit of a slippery slope.
01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:31.000 You said as a leadership instructor, echelon front,
01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:35.000 was kind of implies my job is actually to teach.
01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:39.000 I'm an instructor. I'm here to teach leadership and as leadership,
01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:42.000 leaders at all levels were responsible for their own learning.
01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:48.000 I assure you that at a minimum, it's equal and the truth is it's probably tenfold my favor.
01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:53.000 I have learned way, way, way more than what I have taught.
01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:55.000 In terms of like, what I get at...
01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:59.000 Because every time I teach something, assuming I do the things we talk about,
01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:01.000 I learn something while doing it.
01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:06.000 And I've told youth as a bunch. That's been the biggest surprise of my second career.
01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:10.000 Was having to acknowledge if how much more that is for me to learn out there.
01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:14.000 So just that title leadership instructor. If you have the word instructor anywhere in there,
01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:16.000 I was at Top Gun and Shutter, whatever it is.
01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:20.000 Your job is actually to learn and then help impart that with other people.
01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:22.000 Not just that you are the teacher.
01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:28.000 I got so lucky that when I was at Sealtime 1, as a young and list guy,
01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:34.000 I eventually went into the training cell and taught and taught everything.
01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:40.000 Luckily, and just seeing it, teaching it, you get so much...
01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:47.000 Such a much better understanding of the subject that you are trying to teach.
01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:51.000 That's the coolest thing about being a student at Top Gun is that Marine Corps
01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:55.000 sends you to Top Gun to come back to be an instructor just in your squadron.
01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:59.000 You don't have necessarily the title of instructor, but as a Top Gun graduate,
01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:03.000 especially when you are on the boat, if you are not flying, there is really not much else to do.
01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:06.000 So you are training. That's all you are doing. You are training.
01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:11.000 And so every brief, everything you are doing, it doesn't mean you teach all the briefs.
01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:17.000 It might be that you take a brand new guy and go, hey, you are going to give a brief on how the countermeasures system works in the F-18.
01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:23.000 And you in my mind, I might know that thing, like I could draw that thing out down to the battery.
01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:26.000 But this guy doesn't know anything about it.
01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:31.000 But as the Top Gun graduate, you are responsible for either teaching or training every single thing that goes on.
01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:35.000 That is the coolest part about being a Top Gun graduate is that you are the focal point
01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:40.000 of making sure the squadron gets trained. And so you get to be part of all the training evolutions.
01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:44.000 How many Top Gun instructors on average would there be at a squadron?
01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:53.000 Two. If you are really lucky, sometimes you have a third patch where pretty common, one, maybe two.
01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:59.000 Yeah, they ended up kind of buying necessity, but also just by design.
01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:05.000 And it kind of ended up that when I was in the field teams in the early days, you would go to training cell,
01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:09.000 add a team, the team owned their own training cell, and you'd be in there.
01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:16.000 And if things worked out because you were whatever, you didn't have orders for a certain amount of time
01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:20.000 or you had already done a bunch of deployments that put you in training cell.
01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:25.000 And a lot of guys didn't want to go to training cell because hey, you know, why would you want to go to training cell?
01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:31.000 You're there to deploy. And I went into training cell as I was putting in my officer packages.
01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:36.000 So it was, hey, going to training cell and it'll give you some time to get, because otherwise it's what are you going to do?
01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:39.000 Do another deployment. Of course. Of course. I'm going to go do another deployment.
01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:47.000 Luckily, the master chief, Master Chief faculty, you know, he told us if you want to get good at this stuff, you need to teach it.
01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:53.000 You need to come in here and teach it. And thank God because that's was hugely that had everything to do.
01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:58.000 Because you're de facto detached when you're struck by the way. When you're watching guys do immediate action drills out in the field,
01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:03.000 you're watching guys clearing rooms, you are de facto detached. You're literally watching that.
01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:10.000 So you can see these mistakes. And if you pay attention to it, you can learn a lot from it.
01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:16.000 Marines hold a special relationship with each other that is akin to the relationship of mature siblings.
01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:20.000 They build each other up, share experiences, and hold each other accountable.
01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:31.000 This relationship begins with shared experiences in entry-level training and instills shared understanding of honor, tradition, and the importance of leadership.
01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:34.000 These are your brothers.
01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:42.000 Learning is necessary to leadership strong leaders promote learning in subordinates.
01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:47.000 Needs no explanation whatsoever. Thank you, nice, his Marine Corps.
01:45:47.000 --> 01:46:01.000 Foster and encourage the next section. Leaders model and set an example of learning for the Marines in their charge by openly seeking out and pursuing professional development for all Marines, including themselves.
01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:03.000 In italics. Yes.
01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:08.000 The number one person that you should be getting to learn is you.
01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:12.000 J.P. was reminding you many other day that at some point I said, hey, you need to start re- it.
01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:19.000 This was when we were back in times. And I told him, hey, here's these websites. You should look at these.
01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:27.000 You know what's going on in the world. You know, just not even news, but more intel kind of driven websites.
01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:30.000 And it's I didn't remember.
01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:36.000 As soon as you reminded me, I remember doing that. But that was me saying, hey, man, you need to know what's going on here.
01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:52.000 As stated, MCDP-1, which is warfiting, a leader without interest in or knowledge of the history and theory of warfare, the intellectual content of the military profession is a leader in appearance only.
01:46:52.000 --> 01:47:02.000 Self-directed study in the art and science of war is at least equal and important to maintaining physical condition and should receive at least equal time.
01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:07.000 You should be working out and studying the profession of arms.
01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:15.000 Leaders who set an example with their actions and words that learning is important for the profession of arms inspire other Marines to learn more about the profession and its application.
01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:26.000 Marine leaders prioritize learning for themselves and others taking an active role to foster and encourage marine learning.
01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:37.000 Leaders foster learning by engaging their Marines taking interest in their well-being and supporting their professional development. Leaders are justifiably proud when their marine succeed.
01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:44.000 Conversely, leaders help them overcome the stakes when they struggle.
01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:50.000 Leaders do not wait for mistakes or failures to highlight a learning opportunity.
01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:59.000 They provide subordinates with the sufficient freedom of action to learn and develop without seating responsibility to monitor supervising correct subordinates actions when necessary.
01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:07.000 We cannot rightly expect subordinates to exercise boldness and initiative in the field when they are accustomed to being over supervised in garrison.
01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:13.000 The goal is for Marines to seek learning opportunities on their own accord even if the leader is not present.
01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:24.000 They've embedded decentralized command into the process of learning in the Marine Corps, making it a part of your very being.
01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:28.000 And if you don't do that, you're putting your Marines lives at risk.
01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:31.000 Factual.
01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:38.000 Teaching and leading. Next section. Teaching and leading cannot be uncopled.
01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:41.000 Think about that one, echoed Charles.
01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:49.000 Marines who cannot teach will struggle as leaders. Strong leaders do not perrate a subordinate for making a first mistake.
01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:54.000 They turn mistakes into teachable moments.
01:48:54.000 --> 01:49:04.000 If you imagine if you don't have control over your temper, someone makes a mistake and you lose your temper, you're just thrown away an opportunity for someone to learn.
01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:09.000 You've squashed their initiative. All kinds of problems.
01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:16.000 Leaders in Kyrrhus Marines pursue learning opportunities and cultivate an open dialogue to discuss lessons learned when mistakes are made.
01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:22.000 It is the leader's responsibility to recognize act on and correct the mistakes by turning them into learning opportunities,
01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:32.000 understanding that it's far better to learn in a training environment than to make mistakes when deployed.
01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:45.000 You know, it's the idea that you're going to take people's mistakes and turning them into teachable moments.
01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:49.000 There's like another kind of thing that I would see.
01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:51.000 And I still see it.
01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:59.000 And that's this underlying, the underlying ego that gets involved.
01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:06.000 The little thing, the little thing that you can't let out of to make this teachable moment for you Dave,
01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:09.000 because obviously this was a little bit tricky for you.
01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:14.000 You know what I mean? Like there's that little thing and even that right there.
01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:16.000 Even that right there.
01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:19.000 Detracts from the learning moment.
01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:31.000 Just when I let my ego shine through my beaty little eyes and tear it into your ego, it's just detracting from the teachable moment.
01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:34.000 What does that look like just like the way you say it?
01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:35.000 No, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:43.000 The way I say it, the way I come across with, hey, hey Dave.
01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:47.000 Clearly that question kind of stumped you on the web.
01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:51.000 You know what, why don't you want you, why don't you want you, uh,
01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:54.000 why don't you give me a call later to my, I can help talk you through it.
01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:55.000 You know what I'm saying?
01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:57.000 Yeah, the whole, that's the whole five.
01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:59.000 The whole presentation.
01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:03.000 It also lets the other person know what you think of the relationship.
01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:05.000 This is kind of the nature of our relationship.
01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:06.000 Yes.
01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:07.000 I'm here to mentor you.
01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:09.000 We get this question all the time.
01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:11.000 It's like, hey, I really want to have a mentor.
01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:12.000 I think your answer is actually really good.
01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:16.000 It was like, hey, I never like assigned a mentor or assigned myself as a mentor.
01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:19.000 Either one, you should try to learn from as many people as you can.
01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:23.000 But the one that I would see get people fired up the most is when someone
01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:25.000 to go, bro, I'm trying to help you here.
01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:31.000 And that would send people off all the time, which was, hey, I'm doing you a favor.
01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:32.000 I know something you don't know.
01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:36.000 And I'm here to help you learn even that would put someone who, and look,
01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:40.000 the ego is in both sides because if you were to say that to me,
01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:43.000 even like that would be like, right on, what do you got?
01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:47.000 I mean, that would be my goal as a how I'd respond to that, which is easier,
01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:48.000 easier for some people than for others.
01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:50.000 The ego's on both sides, but totally control your own.
01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:51.000 You can only control it.
01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:56.000 Even if Dave has the most, the most totally humble attitude he's open,
01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:57.000 that's great.
01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:58.000 I got lucky, right?
01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:04.000 But any other guy is going, well, you know, actually, the way you talked about it,
01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:05.000 yesterday did even make sense.
01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:07.000 Yeah, all of a sudden we're in a combative mode.
01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:08.000 What do you know?
01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:10.000 Maybe I'm just running a little training drill on him.
01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:13.000 A little ego to check.
01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:14.000 A little bit.
01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:15.000 I'm sure he's good.
01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:17.000 Yeah, I see that out today.
01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:21.000 I was like, I would my ego to or my test on Jamie.
01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:24.000 I was like yelling, like pretending like I was going to yell at Jamie.
01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:25.000 Did you know you were pretending?
01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:27.000 Yeah, well, I was just using it as an example.
01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:28.000 Okay.
01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:31.000 But Jamie was just smiling because she knows, oh, I know,
01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:34.000 factually that Jamie would be like, okay, Joc, I appreciate it.
01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:39.000 Let me go find out because she would just be escalated because she's dealing with this crap all day long.
01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:41.000 You know, that's what she does.
01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:44.000 You know, you know, so she keeps it real.
01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:46.000 Real, real, real, real.
01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:47.000 All right.
01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:51.000 General John A. Lajoon 13th,
01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:56.000 Commodanda Marine Corps, World War I, general.
01:52:56.000 --> 01:53:04.000 The relations between officers and enlisted men should in no sense be that of superior and inferior,
01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:06.000 nor that of master and servant,
01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:09.000 but rather that of teacher and scholar.
01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:15.000 Now I want to hold up right there because that right there is not correct.
01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:19.000 And if there's a second lieutenant in the United States Marine Corps
01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:25.000 and he's working with his gunnery sergeant, he is by no means by any stretch of the imagination,
01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:29.000 the teacher to a student at all.
01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:31.000 It's the opposite, actually.
01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:37.000 So I think, you know, if you were to take a look at this in present tense, it would read a little bit differently,
01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:38.000 goes on.
01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:42.000 In fact, it should partake of the nature of the relations between father and son.
01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:48.000 Again, that's not a great analogy because if unless you're now flipping it to the gunny is the dad
01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:51.000 and the second lieutenant is the son.
01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:58.000 To the extent that officers, especially commanding officers are responsible for the physical, mental, and moral welfare,
01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:01.000 as well as the discipline and military training of the young men under their command.
01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:02.000 That is true.
01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:07.000 Yeah, I mean, I think I'd picture this in the context of being a senior officer with young,
01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:10.000 junior, and listed very young, junior, and listed Marines.
01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:15.000 But this to me kind of highlights some of the problems with the chain of command.
01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:17.000 The chain of command actually can be really good.
01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:18.000 It's good to have a good chain of commands.
01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:22.000 I've been a well-defined hierarchy, but there are huge pitfalls in that because
01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:30.000 organizationally, as soon as you figure out who you are in the organization, you presume to take on some sort of set of roles that comes with that.
01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:32.000 I think I'm very first podcast.
01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:36.000 You, I haven't talked about my very first job as a lieutenant.
01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:42.000 I got lucky because I had one of those guannies that was like right out of the dream scenario.
01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:45.000 Who do you want to be mentoring you in your first job?
01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:48.000 It was this guy named Gunny Pilgrim.
01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:55.000 Who was like, you couldn't make a better Marine who was my subordinate.
01:54:55.000 --> 01:55:02.000 I was his boss, and in no way was I leading him or teaching him or doing it.
01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:06.000 It was a one-way relationship where I just learned everything that possibly could from him.
01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:10.000 Because he was the type of gunny that knew where he was in the chain of command, but also knew what his job was.
01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:16.000 But it actually does require you to look at where you are in the chain of command and detach from that piece and say,
01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:18.000 where am I in this relationship?
01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:20.000 And what do I actually need to learn from this?
01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:24.000 And if you can view it like that, the chain can have really a sort of insignificant there.
01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:28.000 Because as a junior officer, I had nothing constructed to offer this guy.
01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:29.000 Nothing.
01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:30.000 Gunny Pilgrim.
01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:32.000 Gunny Pilgrim if you're listening.
01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:34.000 He knows what's up.
01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:40.000 We're going to have to bring him on here and get some good stories about second lieutenant.
01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:41.000 We should bring him.
01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:43.000 You weren't second lieutenant, huh?
01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:46.000 You were first lieutenant by the time you got to.
01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:47.000 Yeah, yeah.
01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:53.000 Leaders who, and so that ends that quote.
01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:59.000 And like I said, there's some just some perception that quote that I think is a little bit off.
01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:00.000 A little bit off.
01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:05.000 I think it's more like if you, if you just to say universally on this quote,
01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:09.000 universally what Marines are to each other, Marines are to each other.
01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:13.000 You know, because I can always learn. I can learn from the most junior guy.
01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:14.000 I can learn from the most senior guy.
01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:18.000 So just depending on what dynamics are happening in that relationship,
01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:23.000 you know, I might be the master in one situation in 20 minutes later.
01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:25.000 You're the master, right?
01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:28.000 That can happen because there's different parts of knowledge.
01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:32.000 And you got to be open and flexible to do both those.
01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:37.000 Continuing on, leaders who encourage and open discussion with their Marines about how
01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:41.000 some actions contributed to outcomes will have greater successes at teaching,
01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:49.000 compared to leaders who simply point out mistakes for Marine to improve upon without context or explanation.
01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:54.000 Yeah, then again, I think that's some old school at least in the seal teams that was more old.
01:56:54.000 --> 01:57:01.000 And it wasn't always like this, but there would certainly be some guys in the seal teams in that when I was in the 90s
01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:06.000 that their role as an instructor was to point out your mistakes and tell you how to do it right.
01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:10.000 Not a conversation, just in just instruction.
01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:13.000 That direction is like wrote memorization.
01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:15.000 You tell me to memorize something?
01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:19.000 Cool, I'll memorize it. I'm actually really good at memorizing things.
01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:20.000 I'll memorize it.
01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:24.000 But I really don't want to really want to do is not memorize something.
01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:29.000 I want to learn how to calculate what to actually do based on thought.
01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:36.000 A little note on here about constructive feedback.
01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:42.000 The goal is not a simplistic discussion of the right answer, according to a leader's personal views,
01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:49.000 but rather for the Marine to develop greater self-awareness and understanding of the situation and task,
01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:54.000 and to be able to adapt the lessons learned for future situations.
01:57:54.000 --> 01:58:00.000 Again, not memorization.
01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:07.000 When I went to college, some of my classes were, I wanted to get an A on the test.
01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:09.000 Yeah, you said this about OCS as well.
01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:11.000 Or did you go to OCS or TBS?
01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:12.000 I was talking about TBS.
01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:13.000 Yeah, memorize this.
01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:14.000 Hey, Roger that.
01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:15.000 I will memorize this.
01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:16.000 I will make flashcards.
01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:17.000 I will memorize this.
01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:23.000 And it would have been so much better if every minute that I had spent memorizing things,
01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:27.000 I was actually having a legitimate conversation about what the meaning of these things.
01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:28.000 So learning and the mission.
01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:30.000 Yeah, totally.
01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:35.000 When I went back, we talked about, I think it started with the first one when we did war fighting.
01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:38.000 Which everyone we did, the first Marine Corps Doctoral Pub, you and I did together.
01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:42.000 When I went back to start reading these again, and we've read a bunch of them,
01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:44.000 I read this last one when I was laughing.
01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:47.000 I had so much fun reading this.
01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:49.000 I had no fun reading these pops.
01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:51.000 I read all these pops at the basics school.
01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:54.000 All of them. I didn't enjoy any of it because I didn't have this.
01:58:54.000 --> 01:58:57.000 I wasn't there trying to learn.
01:58:57.000 --> 01:59:02.000 And the mistakes that I made, I think I've said this several times, looking back.
01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:06.000 If it could just figure out how to take the things out of there and have it make sense
01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:09.000 and you're heading to learn something from it, it's actually fun.
01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:11.000 Learning is awesome.
01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:14.000 And I was going back through these pops as an adult.
01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:18.000 I think in my experience reading this, it was nothing like this the first time.
01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:21.000 But a total waste, so much I could have taken from that.
01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:27.000 So I could have learned so much more, so much faster if that's how I viewed reading these things.
01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:35.000 Yeah. Well, that is a big part of the very nature of this podcast.
01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:40.000 Is, hey, don't just read it.
01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:43.000 I'm not just reading this section.
01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:50.000 And that's that. How am I putting it in context with what I've been through?
01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:53.000 How are you putting it through context with what you've been through?
01:59:53.000 --> 01:59:59.000 And then how can someone that's listening take that and tie them together and say, okay.
01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:08.000 Yeah, there's, you know, as soon as you hear me read from a book and then say, oh, that reminds me of,
02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:12.000 I'm just at that moment in time, giving you another angle,
02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:20.000 another piece of context, another way to triangulate that idea in your own head, which is what makes it worth.
02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:24.000 Otherwise, otherwise, people just grab the audiobook or just read the book. Yeah, cool.
02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:26.000 I read the book.
02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:33.000 I even, for me, for me, getting, of course, more out of it than anybody, because I'm reading it and thinking about it.
02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:36.000 And then overlaying and then getting feedback about it.
02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:41.000 So it's this, it's a, it's a, it's a exponential.
02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:48.000 Exponential learning. It's an exponential pressure on my brain.
02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:53.000 Very lucky to be in that situation.
02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:58.000 Continue on, for example, providing topic areas for discussion using the
02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:04.000 Socratic method asking and answering questions to simulate critical thinking, draw out ideas,
02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:09.000 and identify underlying assumptions during during debriefs rather than simply criticizing
02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:12.000 the brain's actions can be much more effective in fostering learning.
02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:17.000 Positive feedback is constructive positive feedback makes learners aware of what they did correctly.
02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:22.000 Reinforces desired behaviors and identifies areas to improve negative feedback that
02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:30.000 unnecessarily tears them, rain down seldom leads to effective learning and can stifle initiative.
02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:35.000 It's a different mindset. This is the type of thing echo when you're talking about
02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:43.000 timing, you know, and priming your brain. If you're an instructor situation, just reading that right there before you go
02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:48.000 and instruct your class is going to help you. It's going to help you teach and it's going to help
02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:51.000 be a blog.
02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:56.000 The next section oddly enough is called humility.
02:01:56.000 --> 02:02:02.000 That's the name of the section by the way. It's just humility.
02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:10.000 When you are a 15 year old kid and you are thinking about which branch of service you are going to
02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:17.000 join and then you are very rapidly coming to the conclusion that the best branch of service to you for you to join
02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:21.000 would be the Marine Corps. You are not thinking about humility.
02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:26.000 You are not thinking about humility. You are thinking, we are the best.
02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:30.000 The Marine Corps is the best. I'm going in the Marine Corps because they are the best.
02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:33.000 You know, humility and that whatsoever.
02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:36.000 And you end up realizing that that's wrong.
02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:45.000 And one of the things that makes the Marine Corps great and makes any organization great is humility, which is why they have a section called humility.
02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:52.000 Here we go back to the book. All Marines, especially those in positions of leadership, can learn from anyone if they are ready and willing to learn.
02:02:52.000 --> 02:03:03.000 However, ego can hinder learning. Commanders, other leaders and instructors learn from the Marines in their charge while also leading those Marines to learn.
02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:06.000 So this is what we just said. I can learn from anybody.
02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:09.000 I can learn from anybody in the chain and command.
02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:13.000 Leaders recognize that humility is a part of the career long learning process.
02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:19.000 The best leaders at the highest levels recognize that the more they learn, the more they need to learn.
02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:24.000 And they set the example for their subordinates.
02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:30.000 How much you don't know. That's the initial stages of Getsu.
02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:45.000 After like your third class, when you think you mastered the whatever, the two moves that you learned and then you realize, oh, wait a second, this never stops.
02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:50.000 Effective leaders also recognize that we are not an expert in every topic.
02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:56.000 So we seek out those who are experts and learn from them regardless of relative rank or position.
02:03:56.000 --> 02:04:03.000 The Marine with the authority, the Marine with authority must make decisions, but until a commander has reached and stated a decision,
02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:12.000 subordinate should consider their duty to provide honest professional opinions even though these might be in disagreement with the seniors opinions.
02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:19.000 As I call that pushback, I want pushback, I need pushback. That's how we pressure test our ideas.
02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:23.000 And of course it's the Marine course. They throw in until you've made your decision.
02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:27.000 As long as that decision comes forward, we're going to get on board with the program.
02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:32.000 Hey, what if it's illegal and moral unethical? We're still going to pushback.
02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:37.000 What if it means, hey, we could get a lot of guys died killed here unnecessarily.
02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:44.000 We're still going to pushback. We need to substrategy and tactics cover that whole thing in agnostic.
02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:50.000 When we were at top, one of the things we had is something called a standardization board, which is like the,
02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:55.000 all the senior instructors to get together to make these really hard decisions. Big decisions that had to be made.
02:04:55.000 --> 02:05:02.000 And as you might guess, you get 26 people in a room, all top gun instructors, all kind of the top of their game,
02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:09.000 you'd have really, really strong opinions. And I think what stood out to me with this comment isn't like the idea,
02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:14.000 hey, I've made a decision. I want you to get on board. Once we've actually gone to the map,
02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:18.000 we've talked to everything. We've made a decision. What I need you to do is be on board.
02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:22.000 Not that you can't dissent, but what I can't have you do is walk out and be like,
02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:26.000 yeah, we're doing this. It wasn't my idea. This is really stupid. But that's what the boss said.
02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:32.000 It's not the same as, hey, we all argued we put it out there. Maybe we wanted an ad direction that isn't what you wanted,
02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:36.000 but it's still going to work. And it's a good idea where we can still do this. And you come out and go, hey, listen,
02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:40.000 there's what we're doing. This is why I'm on board with this. Those are two very different things.
02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:45.000 So questioning those things. There are certainly times to do that. But just because you didn't get your way,
02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:49.000 doesn't mean that it's wrong. It actually might mean that you need to just get on board,
02:05:49.000 --> 02:05:52.000 because you might be the one that maybe you got something to take from that.
02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:56.000 So when we had these stand boards kind of the standing rule was when we're done,
02:05:56.000 --> 02:06:02.000 if you were on the losing argument, that doesn't mean you walk out and go, yeah, well, I lost that argument.
02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:06.000 This is stupid. I'm going to do it, but I'm not really going to do it.
02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:12.000 I'm trying to sit in here, I was kind of racking my brain over here thinking about,
02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:18.000 why is it that me, I in my experience,
02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:27.000 was never, was rarely that I can even remember in a situation where I was saying,
02:06:27.000 --> 02:06:35.000 hey, guys, here's what we're doing. Why is that? Why is it that throughout my career and life?
02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:40.000 So seldom that I can't remember an example of where I said, hey, listen,
02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:45.000 we're not, this is the plan we are going with. Why is that?
02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:51.000 I was sitting here trying to rack my brain and it's pretty obvious and it's like this.
02:06:51.000 --> 02:06:56.000 If Dave comes to me with his idea and his idea sucks,
02:06:56.000 --> 02:07:01.000 it's very easy to explain to him that his idea sucks and he goes, yeah,
02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:08.000 you just poke 14 holes in my 15 ideas. So obviously, that's not scored away.
02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:13.000 So that means it's pretty easy to win an argument when you are that right.
02:07:13.000 --> 02:07:21.000 When you are that right, it's pretty easy to win an argument and I'm decent at arguing.
02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:27.000 So if Dave comes to me with a crappy idea, it's not hard for me to go,
02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:32.000 yeah, Dave, I get what you're trying to say, but this, this, this and this and Dave goes,
02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:36.000 okay, I'll go back to the drawing board. So that's one reason,
02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:43.000 because when I'm right about my decision, it's because you're freaking just wrong.
02:07:43.000 --> 02:07:48.000 You've come in with a bad idea. So that's that's half of the solution.
02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:53.000 That's half the reason why I'm not saying, hey, everyone, no more discussion.
02:07:53.000 --> 02:07:57.000 This is what we're doing. That's 50%. The other 50%.
02:07:57.000 --> 02:08:03.000 Is because when Dave comes to me and says, hey, here's what I think we should do.
02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:07.000 And it's 13 or 12 of the points are pretty good.
02:08:07.000 --> 02:08:12.000 And even though I could lock down 15 out of 15, I'm totally good with going.
02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:17.000 Sounds good, Dave. You win. Roll with it.
02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:21.000 And what does that mean? The amount of times, because otherwise, if I say, no,
02:08:21.000 --> 02:08:24.000 Dave, my 15 ways, my 15 points are better. And you're like, no, my 13.
02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:26.000 And we get an argument about it and find they say, shut up and go,
02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:28.000 do what I told you to do. And now you go, do it.
02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:31.000 You resent it. You're pissed off and whatever.
02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:39.000 But 50% of that's not, or 50% the solution for me is, hey, you're so wrong that you can't argue with me.
02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:42.000 And I don't say that, but I just point out all the things.
02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:46.000 You go, yeah, good point, good point, good point. And you're not going to,
02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:50.000 you're not going to fall on your sword when you are just blatantly wrong.
02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:54.000 People don't do that. Even the most, even the most dug-in person when they get
02:08:54.000 --> 02:08:58.000 shown the 19 reasons why they're wrong, they retreat.
02:08:58.000 --> 02:09:02.000 So, therefore, we all go out with the same plan, or you come into plan that's free
02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:06.000 and close, and I go, sounds great, man. Let's execute.
02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:15.000 Coming down the chain of command, meaning how many times did someone tell me,
02:09:15.000 --> 02:09:19.000 hey, Jocco, shut up and do what I told you to do? Again,
02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:22.000 racking my brain a little bit of can't think any off the top of my head.
02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:27.000 Why? Same thing. Most of the time, when my boss had a bad eye
02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:34.000 idea, I was able to articulate and convince him of a new way of doing it that
02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:38.000 made more sense, or I was able to say, you know what?
02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:42.000 That'll work. I can make that work. I can make anything work.
02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:46.000 I can make that work. You know, this isn't a suicide mission.
02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:50.000 This may not be perfect, but I can go out there, mitigate the little downfalls.
02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:54.000 No factor. So that's why when I read these things, it's like, I know what
02:09:54.000 --> 02:10:00.000 they're talking about, but I very rarely experience it, very rarely experience it.
02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:03.000 I can't even at echelon front. The amount of times I've said, all right, guys,
02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:06.000 lock it up. This is what we're doing. I think we've talked about one of them is like
02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:10.000 a PT evolution at the master, master of four or something.
02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:13.000 Where there was a crazy plan floating around. I was like, you know what?
02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:16.000 There's a lot of risk with that plan. There's no risk with a known plan.
02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:19.000 Hey, we're just going to go with a known plan. We have, by the way, we have a minute.
02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:21.000 Yes, by the way, we got like seven minutes execute this thing.
02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:25.000 We got to make a decision that that's like one of the few almost every other time.
02:10:25.000 --> 02:10:27.000 And if we would, if I would have done a better job saying, hey,
02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:31.000 brief me, I want we're going to need a tomorrow and we can do a dry run and all that.
02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:35.000 I would have been able to say, hey, we could have gone through the cycle of actually
02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:38.000 figuring out, hey, whether that plan would have worked, which it might have or
02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:42.000 be what little adjustment we need to make and then everyone's happy.
02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:51.000 This mentality of open discussion, so by the way, all this revolve all
02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:55.000 around open discussion, right? All this revolve around meat, listening, you talking,
02:10:55.000 --> 02:10:58.000 you listening, me talking, it all revolves around that.
02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:01.000 This mentality of open discussion hinges on the leaders of willingness to
02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:03.000 remain humble and accept the honest feedback.
02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:07.000 Therefore, all Marines prepare themselves to become leaders by exercising
02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:10.000 humility and being open to constructive feedback.
02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:14.000 Boom, this is a message to everyone in the world.
02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:24.000 Continuing on, the path to mastery starts out, starts with a sense of humility.
02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:28.000 The path to mastery starts out with a sense of humility.
02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:32.000 Marines recognize that they do not know everything and therefore must
02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:35.000 remain humble as they pursue greater understanding and competence.
02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:39.000 Marines should always recognize that there will be more to learn and they
02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:43.000 must embrace their curiosity in order to continuously learn.
02:11:43.000 --> 02:11:48.000 Curiosity will lead Marines to knowledge required to fill their own gaps and
02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:51.000 experience and improve their skill set.
02:11:51.000 --> 02:11:56.000 And that curiosity is tying back to what I started this whole thing off with me
02:11:56.000 --> 02:12:00.000 like wanting to know a better way, is there a better way to do this?
02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:06.000 Is that tradition right? Is that standard operating procedure correct?
02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:12.000 When a Marine begins to feel more confident, it is because he or she is closing
02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:17.000 the gaps between their goals and their actual capabilities.
02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:22.000 Reaching a goal along the path to mastery is an indication that it is time to move
02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:24.000 on to a more challenging goal.
02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:25.000 Boom.
02:12:25.000 --> 02:12:28.000 Next section, technical and tactical proficiency.
02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:34.000 Marines begin their pursuit of mastery by developing brilliance in the basics of
02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:38.000 technical and tactical proficiency.
02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:41.000 At all levels, technical and tactical proficiency requires
02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:45.000 Marines to reflect upon what they have learned, identify learning gaps and
02:12:45.000 --> 02:12:46.000 close them.
02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:50.000 Self reflection enables Marines to evaluate the quality of their practice,
02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:55.000 recognizing that deliberate, purposeful, quality practice leads to mastery.
02:12:55.000 --> 02:12:59.000 Incorrect practice and lack of focus does not lead to perfection.
02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:03.000 It leads to negative training that could be transferred into the battle space.
02:13:03.000 --> 02:13:10.000 Marines focus on doing a basic correctly building speed and agility.
02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:12.000 No, no reason to get crazy.
02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:17.000 It's a pick and roll.
02:13:17.000 --> 02:13:20.000 There are many technical skills that Marines learn.
02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:22.000 Some are standard battle skills training.
02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:27.000 And others vary across military occupational specialties.
02:13:27.000 --> 02:13:31.000 Marines build foundational technical skills such as marksmanship and operating
02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:35.000 as part of a team in entry level training.
02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:40.000 Marines learn to be technically proficient as riflemen which provides a common identity
02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:41.000 among all Marines.
02:13:41.000 --> 02:13:48.000 The larger lesson for Marines for all Marines to learn is the hard work, dedication,
02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:52.000 and persistence required when seeking self improvement.
02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:55.000 That's what you're learning in boot camp.
02:13:55.000 --> 02:13:57.000 That's why every Marine is a riflemen.
02:13:57.000 --> 02:14:01.000 Yeah, look, do we need you know how to work your rifle? Yes, we do.
02:14:01.000 --> 02:14:06.000 What's more important than that is the lesson that you learn that it takes hard work,
02:14:06.000 --> 02:14:08.000 dedication, and persistence.
02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:10.000 That's what it takes.
02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:14.000 That's what you learn from becoming a riflemen.
02:14:14.000 --> 02:14:22.000 Marines build on this lesson as they move onto the next technological challenge.
02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:27.000 And then it kind of advances here into the larger picture.
02:14:27.000 --> 02:14:32.000 Marines develop teamwork and competencies so that they are technically and tactically proficient
02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:37.000 as individuals, teams, units, and mag tasks.
02:14:37.000 --> 02:14:42.000 Collective learning experiences build teamwork that enables success.
02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:47.000 Teamwork building exercises provide the opportunity for Marine leaders to both lead the development
02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:51.000 of the Marines teamwork and learn from these exercises.
02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:56.000 During these learning activities, leaders who demonstrate humility by discussing what they did and why
02:14:56.000 --> 02:14:59.000 subordinates to reinforce learning at all levels of the team.
02:14:59.000 --> 02:15:02.000 Learning takes time, dedication, intelligence, and the pursuit of mastery.
02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:12.000 And the reason I had to call this out is that in an organization, the organization is collectively also learning.
02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:19.000 That's the big separation between like basic seal training and even when you get done with basic seal training,
02:15:19.000 --> 02:15:23.000 then you go to seal tactical training or when they call it now.
02:15:23.000 --> 02:15:28.000 A seal qualification training, both those are pretty much individual skill sets.
02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:32.000 It's not until you get into a seal platoon, now it's collective learning.
02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:38.000 Now you're learning how to do things as able to, which is totally different.
02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:43.000 And yet builds upon what you learn to do as an individual.
02:15:43.000 --> 02:15:46.000 What was the training you led?
02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:50.000 Was the title of that training? Was it West Coast seal training? Was that SQT?
02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:52.000 What was that called again? I know that's not.
02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:56.000 Pretty deployment work up. Pretty deployment, pretty pre-deployment training cycle.
02:15:56.000 --> 02:16:08.000 I usually call it advanced training even though technically the if you looked by the book, the advanced training that is run is actually advanced individual training.
02:16:08.000 --> 02:16:12.000 That's what they call advanced individual training, which is hey, you're going to learn to be a sniper.
02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:16.000 You're going to learn to be a parachute rigger. You're going to learn to be a medic.
02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:20.000 Those things are advanced training is what they call it.
02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:26.000 The simplest way to explain what I did is I just call it advanced training.
02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:30.000 There's a seal that would be sitting in the audience go you didn't run advanced training.
02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:35.000 Like no, I ran advanced collective platoon training.
02:16:35.000 --> 02:16:40.000 So it's simple way to put it is to say advanced training even though there's a technical.
02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:48.000 There's a command called advanced training. It's ATC advanced training command and they teach dive supervisor.
02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:52.000 Got ATC radio men. They teach individual skills.
02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:55.000 But it's what I taught was the advanced.
02:16:55.000 --> 02:16:59.000 And usually what I actually call it is advanced tactical training because that's what it was.
02:16:59.000 --> 02:17:02.000 And that's what it still is. It's advanced tactical training.
02:17:02.000 --> 02:17:04.000 How do you? And that's the unit.
02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:06.000 Collectivate. You didn't level training.
02:17:06.000 --> 02:17:14.000 And actually now that you say it, what I actually taught is called ULT unit level training on it.
02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:24.000 How much just hearing you say that how much has buds evolved and changed what they did compared to what you did and how much that evolved.
02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:26.000 Yeah, unit level training evolves all the time.
02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:27.000 All the time, right?
02:17:27.000 --> 02:17:31.000 But it is a, it buds is what buds is.
02:17:31.000 --> 02:17:42.000 And you can, you know, there's something, if, if somebody that went through buds in 1964 went and watched buds right now, they would go,
02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:45.000 Oh, yeah, we just, oh, yeah, they'd get a lot of reminders.
02:17:45.000 --> 02:17:50.000 If they came and watched a seal, Patu and going through urban warfare training, they'd be like,
02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:56.000 Damn. They'd say, damn. Now, the land war first stuff has been,
02:17:56.000 --> 02:18:06.000 it's, it's really been very similar. All the, no, I can't even say that because we have the, the, the laser tag system.
02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:11.000 We got all the, they would do pyro and stuff, but we, the laser tag system and the paintball and stuff would just,
02:18:11.000 --> 02:18:17.000 I was around when paintball started to come out in the seal teams and it, and it changed everything for us.
02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:22.000 It changed everything for us because, unfortunately, most of the Vietnam guys were gone.
02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:30.000 And so, all of a sudden, we started doing wrote things, wrote things, meaning, here's the problem.
02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:34.000 Here's the solution. And that's not what a learning organization does.
02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:40.000 They don't do wrote things. No, they don't do wrote things, but hey, if you get contacted from this position in your patrol,
02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:43.000 here's the wrote answer to that, do that thing.
02:18:43.000 --> 02:18:49.000 And what happens is the enemy that you're going against is paper targets, they don't move and they don't shoot back.
02:18:49.000 --> 02:18:54.000 They don't maneuver and they don't shoot back. Well, guess what? That's actually what combat is.
02:18:54.000 --> 02:18:59.000 Combat is fire maneuver. And now you're going against an enemy that doesn't maneuver or shoot back.
02:18:59.000 --> 02:19:01.000 It doesn't cover move, doesn't fire move, doesn't do anything.
02:19:01.000 --> 02:19:09.000 So it's, it's, it's not that it's worthless because you will learn what the mechanics of movement are.
02:19:09.000 --> 02:19:16.000 Yeah, yeah. But, and, and we used to do this to we would do no fire drills where hey, you're going to get contacted from a bunch of different places,
02:19:16.000 --> 02:19:21.000 but you're not shooting or we use blanks, we use Dits gear, did you ever use Dits gear?
02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:24.000 Oh, no, it's not Dits gear. What's a miles gear?
02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:30.000 Yeah, yeah. So Dits was like the modern for us in the sealed team. Dits was the modern version of miles gear.
02:19:30.000 --> 02:19:38.000 Miles gear was kind of, it had a lot of, it had a lot of, a lot of, a lot of, a lot of issues with miles gear.
02:19:38.000 --> 02:19:41.000 The old miles gear that we had in the 80s and 90s.
02:19:41.000 --> 02:19:46.000 It wasn't, you know, it didn't work really well and it was just, it wasn't great.
02:19:46.000 --> 02:19:52.000 And you coupled that with a bad attitude, which is, here's something I heard.
02:19:52.000 --> 02:19:58.000 The thing that was, was, it's going to give you training scars.
02:19:58.000 --> 02:20:05.000 Like they would say that about paintball. They'd say, hey, if you're using paintball guns, you're going to get training scars.
02:20:05.000 --> 02:20:12.000 Meaning, I'm going to forget how to load my real weapon because I'm used to reloading a paintball gun.
02:20:12.000 --> 02:20:20.000 And so now when the moment hits, I'm fumbling around, looking for a hopper to put my more paintball in.
02:20:20.000 --> 02:20:26.000 We can't do it because of that. And what that essentially does, unfortunately, throws the baby out with the bathwater.
02:20:26.000 --> 02:20:34.000 Because the training scars that you get from only fighting against paper targets are worse than the training scars you get from having to use a different weapon
02:20:34.000 --> 02:20:50.000 to run these scenarios. So to go back to your point and I see where you're going with this, the basic level training of individuals has advanced and evolved a lot less than the unit level training,
02:20:50.000 --> 02:20:54.000 where we were constantly adapting from what was happening on the battlefield.
02:20:54.000 --> 02:21:01.000 Was that similar for you guys? I mean, if someone went through flight school right now, they would look very similar to World War II flight school.
02:21:01.000 --> 02:21:09.000 That thing is not a, and it was just this idea of what a learning organization was. It's the organization has to learn.
02:21:09.000 --> 02:21:16.000 And look, and I'm sure it's true for buzz. You've described it, but you know, OCS primary flight training, they're a very specific function.
02:21:16.000 --> 02:21:19.000 But that function is not to teach war fighting.
02:21:19.000 --> 02:21:28.000 And so the evolution of those organizations really isn't that dramatic. It doesn't change very much because it's teaching these fundamental skills that are absolutely required.
02:21:28.000 --> 02:21:33.000 But they're not the skills that you would utilize in the only skills you'd utilize for war fighting.
02:21:33.000 --> 02:21:44.000 I just think this point is a leader when you read that idea about learning organization is that a learning organization evolves in adapts and changes and right back to what you started with was my story at Topkin,
02:21:44.000 --> 02:21:54.000 which was you actually need to be out in front of that and leading your organization. So your organization is designed to learn, the organism that you're a part of learns.
02:21:54.000 --> 02:22:04.000 And when you start in the military like OCS or boot camp or even a little bit TBS, I bet if I went back to OCS right now, I'd take that.
02:22:04.000 --> 02:22:15.000 Yeah, that's about right. I see guys marching on the grinder. I see guys ripping their their bed sheets off their racks and throwing their matches on the floor. I see people yelling and screaming and that's probably looks much closer.
02:22:15.000 --> 02:22:28.000 I went back to if I went to air wing training at Topkin up at Fowler now, like damn you guys are up here. I guarantee you I'd say you guys have up your game a lot just because I've been out of it for long enough because that is a learning organization.
02:22:28.000 --> 02:22:33.000 That's really I think the goal and I think again the parallels are pretty obvious in how clear that is.
02:22:33.000 --> 02:22:36.000 And it's not to imply that those basics are an important they're critical.
02:22:36.000 --> 02:22:47.000 But and they mentioned that here just a little bit ago they're saying look what Marines do is get brilliant at the basics and when I was running trade at.
02:22:47.000 --> 02:22:54.000 I actually changed the terminology that we used to describe basic I ads.
02:22:54.000 --> 02:23:01.000 I changed it from basic to fundamental because it's truth because guys we think well I'm not going to do the basics.
02:23:01.000 --> 02:23:11.000 But I think that's a fundamental fundamental fundamental. This is what it actually all boils down to these things these fundamental things and you know what.
02:23:11.000 --> 02:23:16.000 There there have been changes but guess what's never changed cover move.
02:23:16.000 --> 02:23:21.000 Keep the things simple prioritize the actual decentralized map those things have not changed.
02:23:21.000 --> 02:23:24.000 And I don't foresee them trade change.
02:23:24.000 --> 02:23:27.000 Conclusion.
02:23:27.000 --> 02:23:41.000 Strong leaders are also teachers and mentors every Marine is a current or future leader and therefore leads by example to seek learning opportunities for themselves and other Marines.
02:23:41.000 --> 02:23:56.000 All Marines, especially those in positions of leadership should strive to remain humble so they are ready and willing to learn from anyone at any time in any place.
02:23:56.000 --> 02:24:03.000 Learning is an institutional priority and a professional expectation for all Marines.
02:24:03.000 --> 02:24:12.000 Continuous, disciplined and progressive learning is necessary for war fighting readiness.
02:24:12.000 --> 02:24:17.000 Learning is the foundation for all that Marines do.
02:24:17.000 --> 02:24:21.000 It is the key, a naibler for all war fighting functions.
02:24:21.000 --> 02:24:26.000 And our purpose as the nation's naval expeditionary force in readiness.
02:24:26.000 --> 02:24:31.000 Marines learn to quickly recognize and understand important information.
02:24:31.000 --> 02:24:35.000 Adapt, make sound decisions and act.
02:24:35.000 --> 02:24:39.000 Which is especially important in the fog and friction of war.
02:24:39.000 --> 02:24:44.000 All Marines must understand that continuous learning is a priority.
02:24:44.000 --> 02:25:02.000 And key to alreadyness as the nation's first line of defense always being ready to be the first to fight.
02:25:02.000 --> 02:25:11.000 And that's the last line of that document aside from a giant bibliography of all the different documents that they cite in there.
02:25:11.000 --> 02:25:19.000 Many of which are actually other Marine Corps, which would seem like all that's incestuous.
02:25:19.000 --> 02:25:24.000 If those original pubs weren't so freaking solid.
02:25:24.000 --> 02:25:29.000 But that idea that learning is the foundation for all that Marines doing.
02:25:29.000 --> 02:25:31.000 It's the key in naibler.
02:25:31.000 --> 02:25:36.000 The key in naibler to be able to collect, absorb and understand information.
02:25:36.000 --> 02:25:45.000 And then use that information to make good decisions and execute is all based on learning.
02:25:45.000 --> 02:25:51.000 And that obviously doesn't only apply to Marines.
02:25:51.000 --> 02:25:54.000 It applies to everybody.
02:25:54.000 --> 02:26:01.000 And I'll tell you, I think we've had this, how long have we been, how long did I,
02:26:01.000 --> 02:26:06.000 what is this better than about a month cycle of us with this document? It's been about a month.
02:26:06.000 --> 02:26:15.000 I have been paying attention and have realized what, a better understanding of what,
02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:19.000 I haven't realized fully what it is, but I have a better understanding of learning.
02:26:19.000 --> 02:26:23.000 And that I have been learning.
02:26:23.000 --> 02:26:30.000 And more important, what difference it makes when you are proactively learning.
02:26:30.000 --> 02:26:40.000 When you are actually engaging, you're, you're putting pressure on your brain to proactively learn.
02:26:40.000 --> 02:26:42.000 Makes a huge difference.
02:26:42.000 --> 02:26:48.000 Learning because you're experiencing something or learning because you are being taught, like think of those two things.
02:26:48.000 --> 02:26:54.000 Learning because you're experiencing it and learning because you're being taught, that's one level of learning.
02:26:54.000 --> 02:27:07.000 But when you learn because you are actively engaging your brain and processing information and making it part of your usable knowledge.
02:27:07.000 --> 02:27:11.000 Making it part of your usable knowledge.
02:27:11.000 --> 02:27:16.000 Hey, I'm not just taking this fact, then storing it in there and not being able to take it out and recollect it.
02:27:16.000 --> 02:27:23.000 Not only recollect it because who cares about recollecting it, but taking it to apply it to a problem and solve a problem.
02:27:23.000 --> 02:27:31.000 Or use it, look, what are the chances that you come up with a problem that fits this thing that you learned and it's an exact fit.
02:27:31.000 --> 02:27:36.000 No, you got to take six different little elements that you've learned actively learn.
02:27:36.000 --> 02:27:40.000 You've engaged your brain and you apply a little piece there and a little piece over there.
02:27:40.000 --> 02:27:44.000 And then you have that knowledge and you use it and you apply it.
02:27:44.000 --> 02:27:46.000 And that is the deal.
02:27:46.000 --> 02:27:48.000 That is the game changer.
02:27:48.000 --> 02:27:56.000 And that is learning.
02:27:56.000 --> 02:28:03.000 We're pretty fired up about learning over here on my side.
02:28:03.000 --> 02:28:05.000 Echo Charles.
02:28:05.000 --> 02:28:12.000 Yeah, then you make a good point with like, are you say usable, usable knowledge?
02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:18.000 Is it where? It's a whole different thing. So that's weird because okay, so you don't remember when you're in school.
02:28:18.000 --> 02:28:19.000 I don't know.
02:28:19.000 --> 02:28:21.000 Think, bro, were you a good student?
02:28:21.000 --> 02:28:22.000 I was okay.
02:28:22.000 --> 02:28:25.000 You seem like you're like, you do a good student.
02:28:25.000 --> 02:28:29.000 As opposed to just say, no, I was, I was not a trouble maker.
02:28:29.000 --> 02:28:30.000 I was quiet.
02:28:30.000 --> 02:28:31.000 I did well in school.
02:28:31.000 --> 02:28:33.000 I did not work very hard.
02:28:33.000 --> 02:28:35.000 So I wasn't like a studious guy.
02:28:35.000 --> 02:28:36.000 I didn't like try hard in school.
02:28:36.000 --> 02:28:37.000 Right, right.
02:28:37.000 --> 02:28:44.000 Okay, so for like a better way of putting maybe just happen to get good grades kind of thing, give me kind of who you are.
02:28:44.000 --> 02:28:45.000 You could say that, I guess.
02:28:45.000 --> 02:28:46.000 Sure.
02:28:46.000 --> 02:28:52.000 I'll say that, but I will also say, juggle what were you good student in high school?
02:28:52.000 --> 02:28:53.000 Yeah, no.
02:28:53.000 --> 02:29:00.000 Okay, so a lot of it seemed like in school in a learning should be fun, which you said by the way today.
02:29:00.000 --> 02:29:03.000 Learning should be fun, right? I've heard that before.
02:29:03.000 --> 02:29:05.000 Yeah, I'm like, James Damon actually.
02:29:05.000 --> 02:29:10.000 I like it. I, yeah, as an adult, I think we can realize that a little bit more especially when we're in to learning.
02:29:10.000 --> 02:29:13.000 But you know, how like when you're in school, they're like, you're learning should be fun.
02:29:13.000 --> 02:29:17.000 You're like, well, I'm doing it wrong because this is super boring.
02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:19.000 You know, like playing at the park is fun.
02:29:19.000 --> 02:29:20.000 The slides fun.
02:29:20.000 --> 02:29:21.000 Recess is fun.
02:29:21.000 --> 02:29:22.000 Lunchtime fun.
02:29:22.000 --> 02:29:24.000 Learning part, not so much. Pretty boring.
02:29:24.000 --> 02:29:30.000 And this is what I think is this is why I think because it's not usable knowledge in your brain.
02:29:30.000 --> 02:29:34.000 It is long term for sure, but you don't, you don't feel it.
02:29:34.000 --> 02:29:43.000 I'm going to let Jaco talk because I actually am not. I'm going to say, though, because it might be kind of what we're thinking.
02:29:43.000 --> 02:29:48.000 I just said, I had fun reading this. I had fun reading this book, this pop.
02:29:48.000 --> 02:29:53.000 I had fun doing it, which is kind of crazy to think about because the first time I did it was just purely a chore.
02:29:53.000 --> 02:29:56.000 I actually think learning is fun.
02:29:56.000 --> 02:29:59.000 So I do stuff with my kids. I got a six year old boy.
02:29:59.000 --> 02:30:02.000 Like we are doing things now. He's able to do things with his hands and built up.
02:30:02.000 --> 02:30:05.000 And he's learning things and he's having fun doing it.
02:30:05.000 --> 02:30:11.000 It's what is the problem is that the inability to make the connection that everything they're learning,
02:30:11.000 --> 02:30:13.000 even the ones that feel like a chore.
02:30:13.000 --> 02:30:20.000 If I could somehow convince my kid, listen, buddy, I know it doesn't make sense right now,
02:30:20.000 --> 02:30:24.000 but you will one day make the connection between this and other things.
02:30:24.000 --> 02:30:28.000 If I could, which I can't do because he's six, if I could help him make that connection,
02:30:28.000 --> 02:30:33.000 he would be much happier learning things that don't make sense as why he's learning them.
02:30:33.000 --> 02:30:35.000 It's the inability to make the connection.
02:30:35.000 --> 02:30:38.000 The thing of it is that you said something, I'm going to go like,
02:30:38.000 --> 02:30:40.000 since I cracked this thing open.
02:30:40.000 --> 02:30:42.000 I said this to you a little while ago,
02:30:42.000 --> 02:30:45.000 hey dude, this is coming out. They're about to publish this thing.
02:30:45.000 --> 02:30:53.000 Even in the last month, I am looking around and seeing things that I've been looking around and seeing in my entire life.
02:30:53.000 --> 02:30:58.000 That's because I can make the connection between learning things and how it creates,
02:30:58.000 --> 02:31:03.000 not just the usable knowledge, but how it makes my life better and helps me be better at what I do.
02:31:03.000 --> 02:31:06.000 If you could make that connection for your kids,
02:31:06.000 --> 02:31:11.000 and I think that's the hardest part for me is, hey, but we can't just all do the things that you're enjoying.
02:31:11.000 --> 02:31:13.000 We got to do some of these other things that are important,
02:31:13.000 --> 02:31:19.000 but I promise you they'll have value and meaning, that's hard to cross that bridge and make that gap for a sexual old.
02:31:19.000 --> 02:31:24.000 But I've never seen anybody who learned something, not enjoy learning it once they figured out what they're doing.
02:31:24.000 --> 02:31:26.000 You were so close.
02:31:26.000 --> 02:31:27.000 So close.
02:31:27.000 --> 02:31:28.000 So close.
02:31:28.000 --> 02:31:31.000 It's taken my thunder away.
02:31:31.000 --> 02:31:32.000 You were so close.
02:31:32.000 --> 02:31:34.000 I'm glad I gave you the opportunity to attempt.
02:31:34.000 --> 02:31:36.000 You were dancing around it.
02:31:36.000 --> 02:31:38.000 You were dancing around it and tell me if I'm wrong.
02:31:38.000 --> 02:31:41.000 Well, I was thinking of like, man, I'm going to start saying something.
02:31:41.000 --> 02:31:43.000 He's going to say, and every time I try to say something, he's going to say it.
02:31:43.000 --> 02:31:47.000 Echo says, if you could say it like him, it'd be better.
02:31:47.000 --> 02:31:50.000 So I almost, I should have just followed my instinct, which is the same.
02:31:50.000 --> 02:31:53.000 You were dancing around what I was thinking.
02:31:53.000 --> 02:31:54.000 Okay.
02:31:54.000 --> 02:31:55.000 Which is this.
02:31:55.000 --> 02:31:59.000 You're saying, hey, you've got this thing and you can't make a connection in the future.
02:31:59.000 --> 02:32:01.000 I'm going to take that one step further.
02:32:01.000 --> 02:32:03.000 Imagine this.
02:32:03.000 --> 02:32:06.000 Which I thought you were going to say is the key phrase.
02:32:06.000 --> 02:32:08.000 And then I thought you were going to say is the key phrase.
02:32:08.000 --> 02:32:14.000 The application of knowledge actually being able to use it is where that connection gets made.
02:32:14.000 --> 02:32:22.000 So when you teach your son how to do something that he can apply immediately, that's fun.
02:32:22.000 --> 02:32:29.000 Imagine if in Gjitsu what you had to do was do an armlock on a, on a, what is it?
02:32:29.000 --> 02:32:30.000 A grappling dummy.
02:32:30.000 --> 02:32:32.000 That's what your lessons were.
02:32:32.000 --> 02:32:35.000 Would that be fun, right?
02:32:35.000 --> 02:32:37.000 Marginal.
02:32:37.000 --> 02:32:38.000 Okay.
02:32:38.000 --> 02:32:40.000 This did you not want to give me a solid answer.
02:32:40.000 --> 02:32:41.000 What's more fun?
02:32:41.000 --> 02:32:44.000 Are I'm locking a grappling dummy or armlocking a training partner?
02:32:44.000 --> 02:32:45.000 Let me ask you this.
02:32:45.000 --> 02:32:48.000 How many armlocks have you done on a grappling dummy?
02:32:48.000 --> 02:32:49.000 One.
02:32:49.000 --> 02:32:50.000 Okay.
02:32:50.000 --> 02:32:52.000 How many armlocks have you done on training partners?
02:32:52.000 --> 02:32:53.000 One million.
02:32:53.000 --> 02:32:54.000 Exactly.
02:32:54.000 --> 02:32:59.000 So this, what, what you said Dave told me accurately.
02:32:59.000 --> 02:33:05.000 And I think where that connection actually gets made is when you are, have the,
02:33:05.000 --> 02:33:09.000 have the opportunity to apply that knowledge.
02:33:09.000 --> 02:33:15.000 So if you teach your kids something and all of a sudden they go to the store and you go,
02:33:15.000 --> 02:33:22.000 hey, it's 78 cents, you know, get out the coins and the kid gets to take out three
02:33:22.000 --> 02:33:28.000 quarters and three pennies and put them on the table and he applied that and you give them a nod.
02:33:28.000 --> 02:33:29.000 Right.
02:33:29.000 --> 02:33:30.000 Right.
02:33:30.000 --> 02:33:31.000 Boom.
02:33:31.000 --> 02:33:32.000 Yeah.
02:33:32.000 --> 02:33:33.000 The cashier goes, I mean, I'll thank you, son.
02:33:33.000 --> 02:33:38.000 So as much as we can if we can teach people something.
02:33:38.000 --> 02:33:43.000 And then we find an avenue for them to actually apply that knowledge and who knows.
02:33:43.000 --> 02:33:51.000 Maybe this could, maybe the, the goal is to actually teach people and stages where you're teaching them things that they can actually apply.
02:33:51.000 --> 02:33:57.000 Like if you can set it up that way that you're not trying to teach them advanced physics before,
02:33:57.000 --> 02:34:02.000 but when there's no application for it, but then when they get to a point where you can start to say, hey,
02:34:02.000 --> 02:34:05.000 you want to check out, you want to know what the tide's going to do.
02:34:05.000 --> 02:34:09.000 We can actually figure that out from from from astrophysics.
02:34:09.000 --> 02:34:10.000 We can actually figure that out.
02:34:10.000 --> 02:34:12.000 Here's what it is and here's how it works.
02:34:12.000 --> 02:34:16.000 And then people say, so.
02:34:16.000 --> 02:34:18.000 Yeah, application knowledge.
02:34:18.000 --> 02:34:19.000 What do you think Dave?
02:34:19.000 --> 02:34:21.000 Yeah, do totally.
02:34:21.000 --> 02:34:28.000 And the piece that I still am grappling with, the larger connection and, and I wish I could say it more clearly is.
02:34:28.000 --> 02:34:32.000 The piece that I'm struggling with and I think most people struggle with is.
02:34:32.000 --> 02:34:36.000 What you're learning doesn't have to be applied in that same way, meaning.
02:34:36.000 --> 02:34:38.000 So hey, you learn it.
02:34:38.000 --> 02:34:41.000 Let me teach a kid out of count money and then he gets a count money.
02:34:41.000 --> 02:34:49.000 But if I were to tell you that you could be better at arm locking your opponent by reading the Marine Corps pub on strategy.
02:34:49.000 --> 02:34:56.000 Because there's something that makes you think and see differently and some people don't want to read that stupid book because it has nothing to do with what they want to do.
02:34:56.000 --> 02:34:59.000 Actually, it does.
02:34:59.000 --> 02:35:03.000 And if you can make that connection of this thing that seems totally irrelevant to your world, I don't like math.
02:35:03.000 --> 02:35:05.000 I'm never going to go be a math teacher.
02:35:05.000 --> 02:35:09.000 My daughter will say, I'm not good at math and I'm never going to go be whatever.
02:35:09.000 --> 02:35:14.000 There's a connection there to every other thing that you're doing.
02:35:14.000 --> 02:35:16.000 And that's a gap that's hard to bridge.
02:35:16.000 --> 02:35:21.000 It's not that that you're going to go, but you don't have to become a mathematician for math to be important in your life.
02:35:21.000 --> 02:35:24.000 I'm going to stop there because I want to read it to say.
02:35:24.000 --> 02:35:26.000 But that's the gap that I'm talking about.
02:35:26.000 --> 02:35:28.000 That's that's the original idea of the thread, right?
02:35:28.000 --> 02:35:30.000 The original idea of the thread is like all these things are connected.
02:35:30.000 --> 02:35:38.000 And if you realize that they're connected, then you'll understand them better and the better you understand this scientist from 1820.
02:35:38.000 --> 02:35:38.000 Yeah.
02:35:38.000 --> 02:35:43.000 The better you'll be able to relate to this artist in 1904.
02:35:43.000 --> 02:35:45.000 Like those things are real.
02:35:45.000 --> 02:35:56.000 And the mind, the brain is a muscle that the more you use it, the more you utilize it, the better you can respond.
02:35:56.000 --> 02:36:00.000 And so yeah, I think you're actually absolutely right.
02:36:00.000 --> 02:36:06.000 That's when when and it was kind of stuck in the sick year old brain, right?
02:36:06.000 --> 02:36:19.000 Because it's really hard to explain to a six year old, hey, this math that you're learning is going to help you give you a greater capability to win in a soccer game, right?
02:36:19.000 --> 02:36:24.000 Like that, even though we all know it's actually true because you're sharper, you're smarter than you have the million reasons.
02:36:24.000 --> 02:36:34.000 So finding it, finding the application of it and when you recognize that application, and I think that's where I've been very, very lucky because at some point, again, that's some point.
02:36:34.000 --> 02:36:39.000 I said, I can take what I learned in GJitsu and I can apply it to combat and I can apply it to leadership.
02:36:39.000 --> 02:36:43.000 And by the way, I can take something that I learned in leadership and I can apply it to GJitsu.
02:36:43.000 --> 02:36:49.000 And all the way across those, those, those modalities.
02:36:49.000 --> 02:37:00.000 And by the way, those modalities, as soon as you step into some other modality, if you have the open mind, you see the application again and you see it again and you see it again.
02:37:00.000 --> 02:37:12.000 And we do this all the time at Slam Front, we're working with a company that we've never worked with this company before and you take a look at what they're doing, how they're doing it and you can apply the principles that we know.
02:37:12.000 --> 02:37:25.000 And if you don't understand that, it, look, you got to take this little piece of this, this principle, this little piece and you put them in place and look, we get people at Slam Front clients that they've read the book thousand times.
02:37:25.000 --> 02:37:27.000 They've listened to every single podcast.
02:37:27.000 --> 02:37:33.000 And as soon as you roll in and you start talking about it, they don't act quite have the skill yet of maybe how to apply it.
02:37:33.000 --> 02:37:41.000 And as soon as they see how it applies, all of a sudden they're mind expands and you go back three months later.
02:37:41.000 --> 02:37:43.000 And now they don't need, they don't need us anymore.
02:37:43.000 --> 02:37:44.000 They don't need national and foreign anymore.
02:37:44.000 --> 02:37:49.000 They've figured out the application process and that's where they go next level.
02:37:49.000 --> 02:37:52.000 Yeah, totally.
02:37:52.000 --> 02:37:55.000 Speaking of learning.
02:37:55.000 --> 02:37:56.000 Echo Charles.
02:37:56.000 --> 02:37:58.000 Closing the knowledge gaps.
02:37:58.000 --> 02:38:00.000 Yes, speaking of closing the knowledge gaps.
02:38:00.000 --> 02:38:01.000 Don't hide them.
02:38:01.000 --> 02:38:02.000 Hide knowledge gap.
02:38:02.000 --> 02:38:06.000 You know why I think it's fun as an adult, I think more.
02:38:06.000 --> 02:38:10.000 So like when you're young at that and maybe this has to do with part of the brain.
02:38:10.000 --> 02:38:11.000 I don't know.
02:38:11.000 --> 02:38:12.000 I don't know if I'm what I hear it does.
02:38:12.000 --> 02:38:15.000 When you're young, everything is short term, everything.
02:38:15.000 --> 02:38:16.000 True.
02:38:16.000 --> 02:38:20.000 Like the long term, the brain has a hard time to comprehend that.
02:38:20.000 --> 02:38:25.000 So like you'll get students, like young students or whatever, who get really good grades,
02:38:25.000 --> 02:38:30.000 but that tends to be because their goal is to get good grades.
02:38:30.000 --> 02:38:33.000 It's not to like learn math so I can apply it to life necessarily.
02:38:33.000 --> 02:38:34.000 Maybe that's what they're told.
02:38:34.000 --> 02:38:39.000 Maybe maybe not, but as far as they're actual like desire to learn the math, it's like to get good grades.
02:38:39.000 --> 02:38:40.000 Try.
02:38:40.000 --> 02:38:41.000 You're return.
02:38:41.000 --> 02:38:49.000 Okay, so I taught my three-year-old how to choose a slingshot.
02:38:49.000 --> 02:38:52.000 So I should have slingshot.
02:38:52.000 --> 02:38:54.000 So I should have slingshot.
02:38:54.000 --> 02:38:59.000 You watch a three-year-old boy, by the way, you know, probably girl too, but shoot a slingshot
02:38:59.000 --> 02:39:02.000 at a bottle in front of a three-year-old.
02:39:02.000 --> 02:39:05.000 Thinking of thinking it's the most awesome thing in the world.
02:39:05.000 --> 02:39:06.000 And they say, oh yeah, you try.
02:39:06.000 --> 02:39:07.000 He doesn't know how.
02:39:07.000 --> 02:39:09.000 He doesn't know how to put the thing in. He gets all mad at whatever.
02:39:09.000 --> 02:39:14.000 I teach him. He's focused on that thing like man, this is I'm going to learn the world's
02:39:14.000 --> 02:39:15.000 solutions.
02:39:15.000 --> 02:39:19.000 This is the best thing in my life and I need to learn this.
02:39:19.000 --> 02:39:22.000 Try teaching him how to like memorize the alphabet.
02:39:22.000 --> 02:39:26.000 He'll be like, well listen to you, but I'm not into this right now, you know.
02:39:26.000 --> 02:39:28.000 It's just night and day, you know.
02:39:28.000 --> 02:39:31.000 Or try to do a puzzle with a kid.
02:39:31.000 --> 02:39:35.000 Here, just looking for that one piece that fits and when it fits, it's like cool,
02:39:35.000 --> 02:39:38.000 but meanwhile, as an adult, you're like cool, that is cool.
02:39:38.000 --> 02:39:43.000 That's a good incremental progress that we're making, but it's really cool when this whole
02:39:43.000 --> 02:39:46.000 corner is developed and then this whole corner is the end then you put them all together and
02:39:46.000 --> 02:39:47.000 boom the big puzzle.
02:39:47.000 --> 02:39:48.000 It seems same.
02:39:48.000 --> 02:39:50.000 It's like a bigger picture kind of thing.
02:39:50.000 --> 02:39:54.000 Anyway, that's why I think, and then not to mention when you're in an adult,
02:39:54.000 --> 02:39:59.000 what you're learning tends to be something you chose to learn.
02:39:59.000 --> 02:40:04.000 And that's already you're just already going on that path of fulfilling like little
02:40:04.000 --> 02:40:06.000 gaps in your knowledge that you need to be filled.
02:40:06.000 --> 02:40:09.000 So like actionable knowledge kind of thing.
02:40:09.000 --> 02:40:14.000 It's already going to be set up like that just by the very nature of you choosing what to learn.
02:40:14.000 --> 02:40:15.000 See what I'm seeing.
02:40:15.000 --> 02:40:22.000 Yeah, that's why it's important for parents, teachers, human beings to try and get the kids to recognize
02:40:22.000 --> 02:40:27.000 what that threat, that that threat dies, everything together, the long because if we're learning
02:40:27.000 --> 02:40:32.000 for short term, we're learning for short term and it's hard to see where it all ties into.
02:40:32.000 --> 02:40:36.000 Yeah, with that.
02:40:36.000 --> 02:40:40.000 So it's beginning long term short term learning.
02:40:40.000 --> 02:40:41.000 What do you got for us echo Charles?
02:40:41.000 --> 02:40:45.000 If you have, I'm going to go with the knowledge gap situation that really,
02:40:45.000 --> 02:40:46.000 because that's a big one.
02:40:46.000 --> 02:40:49.000 Hiding knowledge gap or closing.
02:40:49.000 --> 02:40:50.000 Oh, yeah, closing.
02:40:50.000 --> 02:40:52.000 It's closing in there for closing.
02:40:52.000 --> 02:40:53.000 Close.
02:40:53.000 --> 02:40:53.000 Yes.
02:40:53.000 --> 02:40:56.000 So, it's facing it.
02:40:56.000 --> 02:40:57.000 Let's face it.
02:40:57.000 --> 02:41:00.000 I don't need to learn how to fight, right?
02:41:00.000 --> 02:41:02.000 Because I don't fight.
02:41:02.000 --> 02:41:03.000 Yeah.
02:41:03.000 --> 02:41:04.000 Big.
02:41:04.000 --> 02:41:08.000 If that knowledge gap is exposed in the real world, you can have a problem.
02:41:08.000 --> 02:41:10.000 We are going to have a problem.
02:41:10.000 --> 02:41:11.000 So let's close that knowledge gap.
02:41:11.000 --> 02:41:12.000 We'll take you to.
02:41:12.000 --> 02:41:14.000 When we take you to what do we need?
02:41:14.000 --> 02:41:15.000 Do you do training?
02:41:15.000 --> 02:41:16.000 Gear.
02:41:16.000 --> 02:41:17.000 Gear.
02:41:17.000 --> 02:41:20.000 If you do not get, we're actually going to do it.
02:41:20.000 --> 02:41:21.000 Okay.
02:41:21.000 --> 02:41:22.000 So we're getting all this stuff.
02:41:22.000 --> 02:41:24.000 There's more stuff by the way.
02:41:24.000 --> 02:41:25.000 Or domain.com.
02:41:25.000 --> 02:41:26.000 That's where you can get.
02:41:26.000 --> 02:41:27.000 You can use best key school world.
02:41:27.000 --> 02:41:28.000 American made.
02:41:28.000 --> 02:41:31.000 100%.
02:41:31.000 --> 02:41:32.000 Are we back making jeans?
02:41:32.000 --> 02:41:33.000 Yeah.
02:41:33.000 --> 02:41:34.000 We are making jeans.
02:41:34.000 --> 02:41:36.000 We are back in the game.
02:41:36.000 --> 02:41:38.000 Jeans are being made.
02:41:38.000 --> 02:41:40.000 You can order them.
02:41:40.000 --> 02:41:41.000 And you will get them.
02:41:41.000 --> 02:41:42.000 We have.
02:41:42.000 --> 02:41:43.000 We're making.
02:41:43.000 --> 02:41:46.000 So if you don't know, we started making masks.
02:41:46.000 --> 02:41:52.000 Face coverings actually because we don't want people to get confused and think that this is an end ninety five masks.
02:41:52.000 --> 02:41:53.000 They're not.
02:41:53.000 --> 02:41:57.000 But there's recommendations from all kinds of people.
02:41:57.000 --> 02:42:01.000 Including law enforcement that will.
02:42:01.000 --> 02:42:05.000 Find you here in the state of California if you're not wearing a mask.
02:42:05.000 --> 02:42:06.000 Yes.
02:42:06.000 --> 02:42:08.000 Is that under certain circumstances?
02:42:08.000 --> 02:42:09.000 You're outside.
02:42:09.000 --> 02:42:10.000 Started May 1st.
02:42:10.000 --> 02:42:11.000 No kidding.
02:42:11.000 --> 02:42:12.000 Yeah.
02:42:12.000 --> 02:42:14.000 So anyways, at origin, we started making masks.
02:42:14.000 --> 02:42:17.000 So that people face coverings.
02:42:17.000 --> 02:42:19.000 So if you want to get those.
02:42:19.000 --> 02:42:21.000 Go to origin main.com.
02:42:21.000 --> 02:42:23.000 You can also get a bunch of other clothes.
02:42:23.000 --> 02:42:25.000 Including jeans.
02:42:25.000 --> 02:42:26.000 Yes.
02:42:26.000 --> 02:42:27.000 You can also get.
02:42:27.000 --> 02:42:30.000 Let's say you're in lockdown at your house.
02:42:30.000 --> 02:42:31.000 Yes.
02:42:31.000 --> 02:42:33.000 You didn't have a gym.
02:42:33.000 --> 02:42:34.000 No gym.
02:42:34.000 --> 02:42:37.000 Your gym is shut down because of COVID-19.
02:42:37.000 --> 02:42:39.000 Now you have no way it's no gym.
02:42:39.000 --> 02:42:41.000 What are you going to do?
02:42:41.000 --> 02:42:42.000 Well, you want to work out.
02:42:42.000 --> 02:42:43.000 You want to train.
02:42:43.000 --> 02:42:46.000 Guess what you can get from origin main.
02:42:46.000 --> 02:42:48.000 Two items right now.
02:42:48.000 --> 02:42:50.000 One of them is a.
02:42:50.000 --> 02:42:51.000 Plyo box, right?
02:42:51.000 --> 02:42:53.000 You want to get your jump on.
02:42:53.000 --> 02:42:55.000 And there's all kinds of things you can do with the Plyo box.
02:42:55.000 --> 02:42:57.000 You don't what I do with a Plyo box.
02:42:57.000 --> 02:42:58.000 Push up.
02:42:58.000 --> 02:42:59.000 Yeah, push ups.
02:42:59.000 --> 02:43:00.000 Yes, jump.
02:43:00.000 --> 02:43:01.000 Yeah, all that stuff.
02:43:01.000 --> 02:43:04.000 You don't have to stretch oddly enough.
02:43:04.000 --> 02:43:05.000 It's one of those things.
02:43:05.000 --> 02:43:10.000 You use it to get yourself in positions that force you to stretch.
02:43:10.000 --> 02:43:13.000 And I am not a good stretcher.
02:43:13.000 --> 02:43:19.000 And then we also have something known as the bird.
02:43:19.000 --> 02:43:22.000 The bird, which is A.
02:43:22.000 --> 02:43:24.000 What would you say it is?
02:43:24.000 --> 02:43:26.000 A leather kettlebell.
02:43:26.000 --> 02:43:28.000 It's a leather kettlebell.
02:43:28.000 --> 02:43:31.000 So it shows up to your house with no weight.
02:43:31.000 --> 02:43:34.000 And then you can fill it with whatever you want to fill it with.
02:43:34.000 --> 02:43:37.000 My recommendation actually pennies.
02:43:37.000 --> 02:43:38.000 Go to your bank.
02:43:38.000 --> 02:43:43.000 Go to your bank and get 50 to $75 worth of pennies.
02:43:43.000 --> 02:43:44.000 Yeah.
02:43:44.000 --> 02:43:46.000 Load them into the burden.
02:43:46.000 --> 02:43:48.000 So a stitch it up.
02:43:48.000 --> 02:43:50.000 Not stitch it, but you tie it up.
02:43:50.000 --> 02:43:51.000 It's actually laces.
02:43:51.000 --> 02:43:53.000 And then you have.
02:43:53.000 --> 02:43:58.000 You got about a 30 to 40 pound kettlebell depending on how much you fill it up.
02:43:58.000 --> 02:43:59.000 Yeah, dang. That's a good idea.
02:43:59.000 --> 02:44:00.000 Pennis are heavy men.
02:44:00.000 --> 02:44:01.000 Pennis are heavy.
02:44:01.000 --> 02:44:03.000 And they're readily available.
02:44:03.000 --> 02:44:04.000 They have met the bank.
02:44:04.000 --> 02:44:06.000 There's going to be a run on pennies in America.
02:44:06.000 --> 02:44:08.000 They're going to go up the county.
02:44:08.000 --> 02:44:10.000 You know, they're going out.
02:44:10.000 --> 02:44:11.000 They're phasing out pennies.
02:44:11.000 --> 02:44:12.000 They work.
02:44:12.000 --> 02:44:13.000 Do they even have them at the bank?
02:44:13.000 --> 02:44:14.000 Yes.
02:44:14.000 --> 02:44:15.000 They do.
02:44:15.000 --> 02:44:16.000 Yes, they do.
02:44:16.000 --> 02:44:21.000 I heard like five years ago that they're straight up phasing pennies out of the whole game.
02:44:21.000 --> 02:44:25.000 The cool thing 40 pounds might seem like for a kettlebell.
02:44:25.000 --> 02:44:30.000 If you've never used a kettlebell before or you don't work out, you're going to be surprised.
02:44:30.000 --> 02:44:33.000 40 pounds is heavy is more than you're going to have to go lighter than that.
02:44:33.000 --> 02:44:36.000 But dealing with the burden because it's.
02:44:36.000 --> 02:44:38.000 Pliable.
02:44:38.000 --> 02:44:41.000 It's actually harder to you.
02:44:41.000 --> 02:44:42.000 It's harder to work with in a kettlebell.
02:44:42.000 --> 02:44:46.000 So like you know a kettlebell is harder to work with a barbell because it's odd shape.
02:44:46.000 --> 02:44:47.000 Yeah.
02:44:47.000 --> 02:44:48.000 Whatever.
02:44:48.000 --> 02:44:49.000 This is one step even harder.
02:44:49.000 --> 02:44:50.000 Yeah.
02:44:50.000 --> 02:44:55.000 So you can get really kind of savage workouts just with.
02:44:55.000 --> 02:44:56.000 The burden.
02:44:56.000 --> 02:44:57.000 Yeah.
02:44:57.000 --> 02:45:00.000 Yeah, that makes sense because it's like, you know, that's the whole thing with like,
02:45:00.000 --> 02:45:02.000 like sandbags.
02:45:02.000 --> 02:45:03.000 Yeah.
02:45:03.000 --> 02:45:04.000 You know that awkward.
02:45:04.000 --> 02:45:05.000 Yeah.
02:45:05.000 --> 02:45:06.000 The awkward is like working more muscle.
02:45:06.000 --> 02:45:07.000 Do you have a burden?
02:45:07.000 --> 02:45:08.000 No.
02:45:08.000 --> 02:45:09.000 Oh, dang.
02:45:09.000 --> 02:45:12.000 Your relationships must not be a very good right now over an origin.
02:45:12.000 --> 02:45:13.000 Yeah.
02:45:13.000 --> 02:45:15.000 Well, it's a hot commodity.
02:45:15.000 --> 02:45:17.000 That thing is good.
02:45:17.000 --> 02:45:18.000 Yeah.
02:45:18.000 --> 02:45:23.000 Well, we sold out immediately, but we got more leather.
02:45:23.000 --> 02:45:25.000 So we're back in the game.
02:45:25.000 --> 02:45:27.000 Making a happen with burdens.
02:45:27.000 --> 02:45:28.000 Yes.
02:45:28.000 --> 02:45:29.000 More burdens for the world.
02:45:29.000 --> 02:45:30.000 Yeah.
02:45:30.000 --> 02:45:31.000 That was good.
02:45:31.000 --> 02:45:32.000 Carry your burden.
02:45:32.000 --> 02:45:36.000 Well, also boots are we're back doing the boots thing.
02:45:36.000 --> 02:45:38.000 Do you have boots ready to know?
02:45:38.000 --> 02:45:39.000 No boots either.
02:45:39.000 --> 02:45:40.000 No boots.
02:45:40.000 --> 02:45:41.000 Very bad relationships.
02:45:41.000 --> 02:45:43.000 Either that or they know me really well.
02:45:43.000 --> 02:45:44.000 You're right.
02:45:44.000 --> 02:45:45.000 You're right.
02:45:45.000 --> 02:45:46.000 You're right.
02:45:46.000 --> 02:45:47.000 Yeah.
02:45:47.000 --> 02:45:48.000 Makes sense.
02:45:48.000 --> 02:45:49.000 Yeah.
02:45:49.000 --> 02:45:50.000 Well, yeah.
02:45:50.000 --> 02:45:52.000 You won't wear boots like this around.
02:45:52.000 --> 02:45:53.000 No.
02:45:53.000 --> 02:45:54.000 I don't wear boots just around.
02:45:54.000 --> 02:45:57.000 But when I go on the road, I only wear boots.
02:45:57.000 --> 02:45:58.000 Yeah.
02:45:58.000 --> 02:45:59.000 Cool.
02:45:59.000 --> 02:46:00.000 Makes sense.
02:46:00.000 --> 02:46:02.000 Everything at origami.com also supplements.
02:46:02.000 --> 02:46:06.000 If you are not keeping your joints in order, you're not going to be happy.
02:46:06.000 --> 02:46:07.000 Big picture.
02:46:07.000 --> 02:46:10.000 Because after a while, they jam up.
02:46:10.000 --> 02:46:12.000 Trust me.
02:46:12.000 --> 02:46:13.000 So yes.
02:46:13.000 --> 02:46:14.000 Joint warfare from Jocco.
02:46:14.000 --> 02:46:15.000 Joint warfare.
02:46:15.000 --> 02:46:18.000 A super krill oil.
02:46:18.000 --> 02:46:20.000 Also, we have the discipline.
02:46:20.000 --> 02:46:22.000 Keep your mind in the game.
02:46:22.000 --> 02:46:24.000 You're brain in the game.
02:46:24.000 --> 02:46:27.000 Dave Burke, super excited about the discipline.
02:46:27.000 --> 02:46:29.000 Pretty much daily.
02:46:29.000 --> 02:46:31.000 Not pretty much.
02:46:31.000 --> 02:46:32.000 It's actual daily.
02:46:32.000 --> 02:46:33.000 It's actual daily.
02:46:33.000 --> 02:46:34.000 Yeah.
02:46:34.000 --> 02:46:35.000 Yeah.
02:46:35.000 --> 02:46:36.000 Yeah.
02:46:36.000 --> 02:46:37.000 We spun up some more cold war, too.
02:46:37.000 --> 02:46:38.000 So I was, yeah.
02:46:38.000 --> 02:46:44.000 If you need that little immune system hitter, you can jump on the cold war.
02:46:44.000 --> 02:46:53.16 war and get some of that. The cans of Disciplingo ready to drink and there's a new flavor
02:46:53.16 --> 02:46:57.20 that will be coming out. Actually there's a couple new flavors that will be coming out. One
02:46:57.20 --> 02:47:08.52 of them is called Sour Apple Sniper. The JPDNL signature and then also we will be announcing
02:47:08.52 --> 02:47:15.32 afterburner Orange. The Dave Burke signature models. And then echo Charles we don't
02:47:15.32 --> 02:47:20.76 have a name. We don't even have a flavor yet. But I sensed in the room today when we started
02:47:20.76 --> 02:47:26.84 talking about afterburner Orange. Let's just say some of us weren't as excited and maybe
02:47:26.84 --> 02:47:35.88 thought that maybe they should have their own talk about rather setting in tune. I think
02:47:35.88 --> 02:47:47.68 you need your own flavor. Well thanks. But yes, the Sour Apple Sniper. Dude, it is so good.
02:47:47.68 --> 02:47:53.48 I did my first two samples of the afterburner Orange. Right now that Sour Apple Sniper
02:47:53.48 --> 02:47:59.68 Apple, they have that dial that thing in. That thing was good. Yeah, it'll take
02:47:59.68 --> 02:48:06.48 some iterations. Yeah, I'm done two. I've done two trials so far. Afterburner Orange. Yeah, I got the first two.
02:48:06.48 --> 02:48:10.80 Got the family. Everybody got in on it. Try it. Yeah. It's just going to take. It takes
02:48:10.80 --> 02:48:17.20 iterations. Okay. Get it there. The, I mean for the first mole. For mint mole, I went through
02:48:17.20 --> 02:48:21.28 10 iterations. Try it again. Try it again. Try it again. And then finally I was like, yep, there it
02:48:21.28 --> 02:48:26.40 is. So all that good stuff. Warrior Kid Mulk. Dockle White T. Man, I made a dockle
02:48:26.40 --> 02:48:32.16 way to the other day like from the T bags. That is so legit. And all this stuff is available

02:50:05.68 --> 02:50:10.88 funny. Hopefully it's impactful. Also, got some other podcasts. Got a podcast called the thread.
02:50:10.88 --> 02:50:18.24 The episodes are out there on YouTube. It's a different, what does it podcast feed?
02:50:21.92 --> 02:50:26.08 What is it called? Yeah, it is called the feed. Yeah, that's true. So there's a, there's a different
02:50:26.08 --> 02:50:31.28 feed for the thread. There's a different feed for grounded. So the thread is about, well, it's about
02:50:31.28 --> 02:50:37.28 we're just talking about thread of things, how things connect together in the world. And we myself
02:50:37.28 --> 02:50:45.60 a derocuper of Margar made. I haven't been doing that podcast. It's been, it's been wild to be honest.
02:50:45.60 --> 02:50:50.08 With his bringing things up in my mind, we're making, we remember things. One of the coolest things
02:50:50.08 --> 02:50:56.000 that he made me remember was this conversation with contractors. I'm in Baghdad. It's 2003, 2004,
02:50:56.000 --> 02:51:01.28 and there's contractors that show up in Baghdad. These guys are black water guys or whatever triple
02:51:01.28 --> 02:51:10.48 canopy guys. And these guys come in to our compound. And they just kind of arrived in country.
02:51:10.48 --> 02:51:15.04 And a couple of reformer seals, you know, probably in the 90s, no combat experience. And they're
02:51:15.04 --> 02:51:18.32 talking to us. And you know, we're looking at their gear and we're kind of giving them a heads up.
02:51:18.32 --> 02:51:26.88 And that deral, because he's good like this, we were asking the guys, because they were
02:51:26.88 --> 02:51:35.04 there about to go to Follugia. And they were taking up armored, at Ford explorers with sounds,
02:51:35.04 --> 02:51:41.36 badass. But the up armored Ford explorers were actually horrible. All they were was a regular
02:51:41.36 --> 02:51:49.68 Ford explorer, two wheel drive, Ford explorer with like a little bulletproof glass mounted inside of
02:51:49.68 --> 02:51:53.92 it. They didn't make any adjustments to the suspension. They didn't make any adjustments to the power.
02:51:53.92 --> 02:51:58.88 It was just, they were junk. And so we're looking at these guys getting ready to go in Follugia.
02:52:00.40 --> 02:52:05.36 And we're asking them, hey, do you guys have run flats? For your, okay, we're asking
02:52:05.36 --> 02:52:08.000 to hate you have this, do you have this, do you have a radio, do you have this? And then it's like,
02:52:08.000 --> 02:52:14.08 hey, do you have run flats for your, for your Ford explorers? And they're like, no. And and
02:52:14.08 --> 02:52:22.64 deral named the podcast, you know, do you have run flats? And it's such a great name because that
02:52:22.64 --> 02:52:27.60 really shows you where we were at. That was towards the end of my deployment. And these guys
02:52:27.60 --> 02:52:33.12 are just showing up. And we knew how bad things could get and how quickly they could get bad.
02:52:33.84 --> 02:52:37.76 And these guys who had just showed up had no idea what they were getting into. And
02:52:38.72 --> 02:52:45.84 within a month, the contractors that got that got ambushed in Follugia and strong up on the, on the
02:52:45.84 --> 02:52:53.44 bridge. Then we're there. So we go into all kinds of things like that type of story, like that type
02:52:53.44 --> 02:52:57.36 of information, which I really haven't talked about in that podcast, the thread. And we're going to
02:52:57.36 --> 02:53:03.04 where we got China coming up. We're going deep on China. And so we also have the ground in podcast,
02:53:03.04 --> 02:53:08.08 which is about you, Jitsu. We have the warrior kid podcast, which is for warrior kids latest latest
02:53:08.08 --> 02:53:12.88 episode. I think it's the latest episode. It's about Johnny Kim. Yeah. Johnny Kims on it.
02:53:12.88 --> 02:53:21.68 Guest guests starring astronaut, doctor and seal. Johnny Kim. Warrior kid soap don't forget about that.
02:53:22.24 --> 02:53:28.88 It's available on Jocquistore now. Is it are we there yet? Are we there yet? Yes. That was a massive
02:53:28.88 --> 02:53:33.76 hesitation. Warrior kid soap gets some killer soap for yourself. And that way you, your family,
02:53:33.76 --> 02:53:41.76 everyone you know can stay clean. Stay clean. Stay clean. Stay clean. Speaking of staying clean,
02:53:41.76 --> 02:53:47.68 we have a YouTube channel. Very clean YouTube channel. Where? Actually, I'm not sure how clean that
02:53:47.68 --> 02:53:53.60 YouTube channel is. Why can't you just go in and do like you need to make channels within the channel?
02:53:53.60 --> 02:53:59.76 One that says, you know, whatever you call hype videos or whatever things you have. And
02:53:59.76 --> 02:54:03.44 dance videos you should have enhanced videos. You should have excerpts. You should have the thread.
02:54:03.44 --> 02:54:08.64 You should have ground it. You should have grounded all in separate channels. That's my humble opinion.
02:54:08.64 --> 02:54:15.60 Yeah. You want a while go home and do it. Okay. All right. Taking action. Well, they are they're in playlists.
02:54:15.60 --> 02:54:19.20 Right. So it's called playlists. So they're called. So you're done that already. I've done that,
02:54:19.20 --> 02:54:25.12 but here's the thing. What you're talking about. Which I agree. Is it I've done that? Or is it here's the thing?
02:54:25.12 --> 02:54:30.88 Which one of these two are we talking about? It's actually technically both. So that is done.
02:54:30.88 --> 02:54:35.84 They're in playlists. So you can go to the playlists section. Then they'll be organized. But if you go to the
02:54:35.84 --> 02:54:42.24 main YouTube, then there's a way to organize it where it displays your playlist with which is what I think
02:54:42.24 --> 02:54:47.04 anyway that you're talking about. Right. Like channels within the channel. Yeah. So when you go to the main
02:54:47.04 --> 02:54:53.04 page, it's like you can's in nonetheless. Yeah. It is done. So yes, they can be played in a row and order,
02:54:53.04 --> 02:54:58.72 whatever. And you know, be not filtered out. But like if you just want to listen to the thread.
02:54:58.72 --> 02:55:03.92 Right. And you just let them play. Boom. See what I say? Yeah. Got them all. Anyway,
02:55:03.92 --> 02:55:08.56 yes, we do have a YouTube channel. Jockpock. Yes, YouTube channel. Video version. Video. See what they
02:55:08.56 --> 02:55:12.88 look like. See what we all look like. Whatever. Also excerpts on there. We got psychological warfare.
02:55:14.000 --> 02:55:19.84 If you need a little psychological hitter to push you through a moment of weakness, you can check that out.
02:55:19.84 --> 02:55:27.68 Wherever MP3. Our sold. Wherever MP3, I was going to say songs, but they're not songs.
02:55:27.68 --> 02:55:33.36 Wherever MP3 audio is coming at you. Check it out. Psychological warfare is the name of that flip side
02:55:33.36 --> 02:55:41.92 canvas.com to code a Meyer making psychological warfare for your eyeballs. Go to flipsidecampus.com.
02:55:41.92 --> 02:55:49.12 Books. We got some books. What book? How about the code? The evaluations. The protocol. Dave
02:55:49.12 --> 02:55:56.72 Burke. How's it going? It's going pretty good. Are you happy with the product? I am. I've been
02:55:56.72 --> 02:56:01.20 more happy with the interaction that the product has created. Yeah. Oh, I've been interaction
02:56:01.20 --> 02:56:07.04 man. It is so awesome. It is a how many people got it and got either back on the path or
02:56:07.04 --> 02:56:12.96 understood the path better. The interaction from that has been awesome. I'm stoked to be a part of that.
02:56:12.96 --> 02:56:18.80 That is the that book is like this is another thing that it that it sort of does. And whether
02:56:18.80 --> 02:56:23.36 is the surprising maybe maybe not. But it's like okay, so you read it right? You could refer to it
02:56:23.36 --> 02:56:28.48 all this stuff. It's like a big part of it is just a reminder to just evaluate how good you're doing.
02:56:28.48 --> 02:56:34.16 And really remember that you have you do have a goal. And if you don't then make a goal whatever.
02:56:34.16 --> 02:56:37.92 So like this is what it'll do. Like if I'll work out, which is a normal thing. You know,
02:56:37.92 --> 02:56:43.76 try to work out. But I'm mentally conscious of like okay, what kind of workout was that? Was that
02:56:43.76 --> 02:56:49.28 a two? Was that a five? You know, and I'm kind of like at the end I have a straight up number done,
02:56:49.28 --> 02:56:54.96 straight up. And then I'll share it with somebody just through up a four today, you know, whoever
02:56:54.96 --> 02:56:58.64 you know, if they're sort of in the game as well. Like that's what it'll do, you know,
02:56:58.64 --> 02:57:02.40 it's a little keep you on track man in that way. Dude without a doubt you start thinking about
02:57:02.40 --> 02:57:07.36 things you've never thought about before. You know, also just being able to say I just need to
02:57:07.36 --> 02:57:13.04 at least get a one over here. Just at least like hey, and you also look at some cookies and you
02:57:13.04 --> 02:57:18.56 say no, I'm not going to go to zero. Oh, I'm not throwing a fan was telling me he had a little scenario
02:57:18.56 --> 02:57:24.64 unfold and he was like, this could be a zero through the zero all the diet. I had a little
02:57:24.64 --> 02:57:35.28 scenario yesterday just had a phryophe zero on on fuel in the intake. Yeah. What?
02:57:35.28 --> 02:57:40.48 In a whole no worse way worse. Don't know. I'm never going to eat donuts. I don't know. I'm
02:57:40.48 --> 02:57:44.48 never going to eat donuts. If you see me eating donuts, you can stab me in the face.
02:57:45.28 --> 02:57:49.20 Because I just not going to do it. But just straight up American
02:57:49.20 --> 02:57:58.000 chicken, bacon cheeseburger, which right we're already not good, but fries with it. That's just
02:57:58.000 --> 02:58:02.72 no fat. That's just unsat. Yeah. That's just unsat at the end of the day that does what is that
02:58:02.72 --> 02:58:08.56 that that amounts to a zero. Yeah. So that's I was actually I asked Laefals like maybe I should
02:58:08.56 --> 02:58:13.84 put some kind of negative numbering like you this could actually take you time to bake out to
02:58:13.84 --> 02:58:21.20 you. Right. You had bacon double cheeseburger. The camera over for the next day is diet. You're
02:58:21.20 --> 02:58:24.72 carrying that with you. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I don't get another point. On tomorrow's note. It should
02:58:24.72 --> 02:58:33.44 be a negative. Even if I ate today, you know, a grass fed steak, you know, whatever and a salad,
02:58:34.16 --> 02:58:38.88 I would still not even be able to dig out of the hole. French fries. I don't mean French
02:58:38.88 --> 02:58:47.52 for come on. What's what would be a one as far as a meal goes? You think? I think she's done
02:58:47.52 --> 02:58:54.40 no. I think I think a well, I don't know. Because look, if there's a potential for a five
02:58:54.40 --> 02:58:58.48 a meal that's a five, a four or three, a two and a one. Well, first of all, it's a whole day, right?
02:58:58.48 --> 02:59:00.32 It's a whole day. It's a whole day. It's a whole day. It's a whole day. It's a whole day. It's a whole day.
02:59:00.32 --> 02:59:03.76 It's a whole day. It's a whole day. It's a whole day. It's a whole day. You don't get up and have a
02:59:03.76 --> 02:59:08.24 ideal breakfast and give yourself a five for diet for the day and call it good. You got to do the
02:59:08.24 --> 02:59:13.68 whole day. If you're on a five for a diet, that diet is that consumption is tethered to other
02:59:13.68 --> 02:59:21.04 things that you're doing. You're up to my, you're going. A one is like, I didn't do anything bad,
02:59:21.04 --> 02:59:24.88 but I didn't do anything like constructive either. I'm not like managing what I'm
02:59:24.88 --> 02:59:31.36 taking. A one's like you ate to survive. You and you didn't do anything that took you
02:59:31.36 --> 02:59:36.40 going backwards. But like, we're so French fries involved. If you were French fries in the day,
02:59:36.40 --> 02:59:40.96 you're not getting a one. Okay. No one. Is this a one day? We'll say breakfast lunch dinner.
02:59:40.96 --> 02:59:47.92 Keep it simple. Okay. Breakfast. We ate frosted mini wheat. No. It's getting
02:59:47.92 --> 02:59:52.32 your artist. It's serious. I always talk about it. Frosted mini wheat. Yes.
02:59:52.32 --> 02:59:57.52 It is right now. I would not shred it. I know. Brother. What no wheat. No whole wheat. That's
02:59:57.52 --> 03:00:02.72 cereal. What about Grinthala? No. No. That's not nice. Hey, there. Here's the other thing.
03:00:02.72 --> 03:00:07.84 We got to look at what is what is it that you've set up for yourself, right? Because some people,
03:00:07.84 --> 03:00:12.48 if you're running a marathon, all of a sudden, you're going to need certain foods that you would not
03:00:12.48 --> 03:00:17.04 need. Had you been trying to cut weight or had you been trying to gain weight, right?
03:00:17.04 --> 03:00:21.60 Right. It's not depends. Listen. There's a thing here that's a large and we've had a lot of
03:00:21.60 --> 03:00:26.40 questions about this. First of all, whoever's like, you mark yourself whenever you want. This is your
03:00:26.40 --> 03:00:31.52 evaluation. If you're a habit, if you're, if you're someone who's spent the last 10 years and you
03:00:31.52 --> 03:00:36.16 get up in the morning and your breakfast is donuts. That's just been your thing, donuts, and coffee,
03:00:36.16 --> 03:00:41.20 and you get off the donut and coffee train and you get up and you have some sort of whole wheat
03:00:41.20 --> 03:00:46.96 cereal thing to replace that. You're doing, you're improving. You're getting better. Now, is that a five?
03:00:46.96 --> 03:00:51.84 No. That's not a five. It's not to like punish you for making one small mistake, but it's the
03:00:51.84 --> 03:00:55.92 measurement of the things that you're doing. The biggest takeaway is what you said is, are you thinking
03:00:55.92 --> 03:01:03.28 about this? Because if donuts as part of your diet, every, that's your, your zero for nutrition
03:01:03.28 --> 03:01:07.52 in your life and you need to get on a path by which that is no longer part of your repertoire. And when
03:01:07.52 --> 03:01:13.04 you don't do that, you got to count for that. You know what? Why even play around? I have the book right
03:01:13.04 --> 03:01:17.76 here. Here's the score of one. For at the end of the day, you ate everything you're going to eat. Here's
03:01:17.76 --> 03:01:24.08 the score of one. Food intake was effective to sustain health, but did not optimize nutrition or
03:01:24.08 --> 03:01:32.40 participate in health enhancing program. So maybe you had some little granola like it sustained you,
03:01:32.40 --> 03:01:39.04 but it did not optimize. Right. Yeah. It wasn't. You were recovering from the week's quarter.
03:01:39.04 --> 03:01:44.16 Zero is did not eat properly and did not provide any nutritional benefit to perform critical daily
03:01:44.16 --> 03:01:53.36 tasks. That's your donuts and a pizza. Right. You're just to gear in a zero. Yeah. Five consumed ideal
03:01:54.64 --> 03:02:02.88 ideal food intake and maintained perfect adherence to diet or fasting. Got it. Yeah. Every calorie
03:02:02.88 --> 03:02:09.84 was optimal. What? Every calorie was optimal and nothing was consumed that didn't contribute to health
03:02:09.84 --> 03:02:15.28 or nutrition allowing for a sustained peak level of performance throughout the entire day.
03:02:16.32 --> 03:02:20.72 No big deal. No big deal. I had an interesting situation to throw out to the crowd here.
03:02:20.72 --> 03:02:26.80 Happening me out Saturday night. So normal day Saturday. We're out. It's good day.
03:02:27.44 --> 03:02:32.48 Took my kids mountain biking. We had a good day. Came back at a good. I think I grilled. We had a normal
03:02:32.48 --> 03:02:38.48 dinner and then we had a little adult situation at the neighbors. We went to the neighbor's house.
03:02:38.48 --> 03:02:42.08 We did some social distancing hanging out. Everything was cool. They're all drinking. I don't drink.
03:02:42.08 --> 03:02:46.64 I'm hanging out. It's all good. We had a good time. Get home just before midnight.
03:02:48.72 --> 03:02:56.40 Feeling hungry Dave feeling so at literally the stroke of midnight. I am consuming strawberry
03:02:56.40 --> 03:03:03.68 mock at midnight. Yeah. I'm good with that. Yeah. I'm totally. Yeah. My last meal was
03:03:03.68 --> 03:03:09.68 late after I didn't need them. I should have just gotten a meal. But I was I wanted something that
03:03:09.68 --> 03:03:14.40 tasted good so bad that I just. That's a good question right there though. One of the good things
03:03:14.40 --> 03:03:18.64 about mock. You check it out. You might feel guilty because it tasted so good. But it actually
03:03:18.64 --> 03:03:24.000 needs probably here. That's a good thing. It's not a good thing. Yeah. And the motive too.
03:03:24.000 --> 03:03:28.24 Right. You weren't like, hey, I'm on this program. This mock needs to facilitate the program.
03:03:28.24 --> 03:03:32.48 You're like, hey, I need something too. It's good. There's the mock. So it's kind of a question.
03:03:32.48 --> 03:03:38.08 Is that so what is that? It's not like a two. It has to be something because mock is good for you.
03:03:38.08 --> 03:03:44.32 Are you if you're working out on any regular basis? Moke is good for you and it does support your
03:03:44.32 --> 03:03:49.52 goals. 100%. It's good for you period. I don't even think this is a question actually. This is a positive.
03:03:49.52 --> 03:03:53.76 Just a good deal. It's just a little guilt because it tastes so good. Yeah.
03:03:53.76 --> 03:03:59.04 Leadership strategy and tactic. So the code you can get that one. It's up and running. We had a
03:03:59.04 --> 03:04:04.16 little lag time. I apologize. I didn't realize that every single person was going to buy it.
