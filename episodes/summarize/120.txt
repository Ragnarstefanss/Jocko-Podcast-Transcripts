You don't like, like, police have like a mandatory program or mandatory situation where, you know, you go through, I think we're like, when they shoot someone or something like that, like mandatory, you have to go to like some kind of like counseling. But I was like, do people, you know, like, does everyone ask you to teach them or do he's like, you know what, people don't, I don't even really talk about anymore because I've become so well known for that move that it becomes, it became less a part of my life. It's good that everyone kind of does it because it seems like, oh, it takes away the negative this deep, you know, like, kind of like, oh, I'm the only guy. You know, like the people that I like to hang out with, there's like set stuff that I know they're into Even though they might have a lot to say or whatever, you know, like some people like they're smart, but I don't want to get up on state and nothing like that. And it's funny though, too, the way those questions are framed, you know, what they want to hear is like, no, you know, what if you got an incompetent boss, you don't help them out, you've got a bird. So, I mean, there's some people, there's some people that don't like, even in the teams, there's people that like, they didn't like me. I showed it to my wife and she said, you know, XYZ and XYZ and I'm thinking, okay, I get it, like okay, you showed it to people that understand, but I was like, wait, wait, wait. That's, you know, like, I got me a leadership, like, yeah, if you become just a, disgusting, sick event, then that's what? You have to actually have to step into the spotlight a little bit so that you can let people know who you are because if people don't know who you are, how do you have a relationship with him and if you don't have a relationship with people how can they trust you? So man, you know, the amount of cruising and kind of relax and even during the role, there's probably significant amount of it almost to the point where it seems like anyway where he kind of maybe expects that or even subconsciously kind of he understands that that's kind of part of the deal. And if you're, let's say you got a new guy that's never done anything before and he doesn't know that he's going to be afraid, going on an operation, then he's going to wonder why a stomach is upset or why he's second guess himself or why he can't sleep. You know, do some self defense based training at the Academy where somebody pulls out the the knife, the fake knife, whatever, what do they call the fake knife and like, let's make sure we know how to deal with that. Because, you know, like, you can hit a guy in a face or get hit in the face and they'll be like, I'm done. If not, you know, like I said, if you hate it, and you feel like you're not being true to your true self, that's okay. You know, like they were doing things like, oh, I've never been in this position before. It's kind of like, remember when we were kids, there was this, this is, you know, like, really chewing gum. Because the obvious, like, I think the answer that everyone wants to hear is like, yeah, dude, most important thing is you've got to be loyal to yourself. But they know where the actual credit goes, even if they don't give it to you, even if they don't give it to you, they know it, even if they have a person who doesn't even realize that you're like, oh, wow, I did all that work and then you get like three four other friends, you know, and everyone's waiting around to be like, okay, where do we start? So now it's like, you don't have to feel like, the one plus who like needs this water. Oh, well, joculous in, you know, when you're in a leadership position, you know, it's like. And I was like, hey, you know, like, well, I didn't have some why didn't do it to me. Like just like how you say, like Clark? So the videos, but yeah, the kind where Clark was like, I know this choke, I'm in mount or I'm in this good position. I was thinking about this, whether it would have got delivered way better, way easier, same thing with your situation if someone's saying, I don't know, let's say, for example, it's a fireman, it's a fireman. You know, you've come up with a pro solution to problem, say, hey, no, actually, I got this idea from something like, oh, you do it. It's like being proactive and being aggressive and shutting down the situation before or even becomes the situation that you know what's going to become. Because if you do take an engine, if you're engine like check engine like comes on and you go and get it maintained, get it fixed, the engine's still good. But you know, if you get a bitter person who's just being in life, maybe not doing it as well in life as they had, you know, had hoped or whatever, you'll probably realize you'll probably encounter them from time to time. It's like it's like it's either taking action or hesitating kind of thing. But in a way, I'm kind of doing what this, what this guy's implying where it's like, I'm going to say to myself, my interest and all this stuff, I love my wife 100%.
