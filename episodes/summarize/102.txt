So it's almost like there's two different types of humility, where, you know, how like someone who's really outwardly, like, um, actually, you've had this example where like, like, caught him a Gregor, for example, where, out, like, to, to hear him talk and stuff like that. So he, we did like a thing where I think it's like a Q&A or something, something like that, and he was, he was talking about that, where in elementary school, he remembers feeling like if I don't have perfect attendance and have perfect straight days, I won't pass this, not pass, but I won't like be the perfect guy or whatever, and he said that he would, um, it would like create like this track to his whole future and his life would be ruined. So like, if you have no ACL, it's like, it's like a blunt, like, it's like if you had a big accord in there, like a real tense, like a tension cord or something that didn't didn't stretch at all. Like if you're like, you know, if you're just focusing on the positive stuff, you know, you know, like you're, you know, what do you just, you know, if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say it at all. You know how people, like you've told me stories of what I'm going to, but you told me stories about someone who made huge mistakes, you know, with you, and you, like handle it, and it doesn't seem like it, like bothers you. And it wasn't like necessarily like, errr, like walking, you know, like a dick or nothing like that. So like the iceberg thing, you know, you know, the iceberg metaphor where it's like people only see the top of iceberg could be low that is like this huge iceberg. Like, if you come, you know, like, I was talking about like, why don't I go into the post office, or go into the grocery store dealing with my wife or something like that. So you're way, you know, your wife comes home, you know, pissed because I don't know whatever, you know, how you said the first reaction, what you feel like doing, which you, not you, but which one may typically do is react accordingly, according to how I feel about this, what you're saying to me, you shouldn't be saying this stuff to me. And he was a thing like Tim will post like little excerpts of like just little quotes, you know, and that's really interesting thing that he did there where he asked everyone the same question. But if I'm like, okay, this is the system, you know, Joc was going to tell me and he's going to be detailed about it and make absolutely sure we don't miss the turn, kind of think, then you're right, dang, that's a good way to navigate, you know? And then what I realized is a big, like, a way to exemplify humility is to, to, I don't know, the, the ability to learn things from someone who might not necessarily be an expert, for example, you know, like, you can learn stuff from a kid. But I would say legitimately, and I'm trying to look at it as, like, honestly, it's possible where me 10 years ago is like, like, if, let's say I know someone and new someone 10 years ago and I have seen them or heard from them or whatever in 10 years. And as far as applying it to like, like, because even in the military, it's like, that's a very specific environment, military, like, unlike most environments seemingly. They see, don't think that, you know, like you're going to help, you know, make this guy look good and they're just going to, they're going to not see it. Yeah, the, you know, how you just said, like some purple belts are great, teach to the, so the belt usually, for the most part, just indicates the, the, the vast, like the knowledge, you know. And like, yeah, you know what, you know, people say like, oh, millennials and this When you, when you kind of pointed out that humility is like a super important thing, I was like, okay, how can I, how can I, I mean, okay, I'm going to assume that's true, because you know what you're talking about. You know, that's like, that's like, you know, that's we focused on social media, but that's just about everything, right? You know like you you know when you drill something or when you're doing the technique just with your partner and stuff you're like Oh, you know, you might not be doing much now, you know, especially if they're like 40 years and like that. You know, there's no real results except for maybe the underlying system, you know, maybe like your heart rate or your, you know, those types of things. So a mashup is like you just take various clips, you know, of whatever, you know, like they're just visually. It's just like, yeah, if you, if you're going super hard and you're knee or your elbow or whatever happens to be against the mat at it, you know, it's like, it's a happenstent situation. That example that you said about playing to there, you, or whatever, where you're like, hey, you know, you know, you, you're going to look really good if you're helping. I understand this because I've been in a situation where I'm like shoot, I feel inside that I don't want to make an effort to make them look good kind of thing because it's like he doesn't deserve it and the thing. It seems like high school is really common when you know like the old classic story of the person who got bullied in high school and then go back to the vintage. You know, you know, like the Toyota high looks, you know, the Toyota high looks is. It's just like, oh, it's just like, oh, this is like way better. So it's kind of like a iceberg, you know, the old people, people, I don't know, lots over that little statement. Is, oh, when we're talking about like being repetitive, like, like, you can be the same thing. So I was like, I was looking all the young team guys like, I remember when I was like that. There's some level of selling fights with Connor, but even at the same time, like, let's say that, because there's such thing as people, probably pretty common that people are legitimately like, into themselves in that way. and it's hard for me to even really say that because like even when I say that word ego, it really like it registers as like this external. And when it becomes like habit, and really all it is, and you can do weird like met up with, which I'm kind of a fan of doing little metaphors with yourself, you know. And then the second, your second example is, it's like, hey, you know, it feels like someone did that to me either way, up or down. Because I know before I wasn't humble before, and all I thought the world like revolved around me, not necessarily like, by the bad way, but just, but you know someone like an instructor can look and see like oh look you're letting him do this or whatever you're forgetting to do this. Like, it's like, we're like, I drive. Like what I'm going to make him look good and now everyone's going to think that he looks good kind of thing. And so, you know, when someone tells you, hey, like you're, you're kind of acting this way, you're kind of this way and to be able to be to figure to yourself that this person could be right first. Like, like when I talk about detachment now, I used to, I used to not know that word when I would tell guys to do it. It's like, you know how, like, you said the mat burn. But like they're super loose, where when I blew out many in college, the doctor, when he, you know, they do the tests, they're like, okay, before they do that, they do the tests. It's like you have to be humbling up to know that you don't know everything so listen up kind of thing. I thought my head, but big LeBoski is one of those like, you know, like Napoleon, dynamite.
