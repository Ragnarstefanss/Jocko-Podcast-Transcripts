00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000
This is Jocco podcast number 89 with echo Charles and me, Jocco Willink. Good evening echo. Good evening.

2
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:20.000
I was sitting in my tactical operation center in Ramadi alone.

3
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:33.000
I was staring at a document on my computer and I had to keep wiping tears from my face as I read it.

4
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.000
The document had been submitted to me by the Delta Platoon Commander.

5
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:51.000
They was in a ward recommendation for Michael Mansour.

6
00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:00.000
And the award was the Medal of Honor for Mikey.

7
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:17.000
He had been sitting on an outcropping of a roof in South Ramadi on an Overwatch and a grenade which had been thrown from an unseen location.

8
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Actually hit him in the chest and fell to the ground in front of him.

9
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:32.000
And he could have jumped away from the grenade and he could have saved himself.

10
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:46.000
But if you had done that, his teammates that were positioned next to him, they would have been exposed to that blast.

11
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:54.000
So instead of moving away from the grenade, Mikey jumped on the grenade.

12
00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
He smothered it.

13
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.000
And he absorbed its lethal explosion.

14
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:17.000
They're by saving our teammates.

15
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:41.000
The morning that it happened September 29th, 2006, I got a call from the Battalion Commander from the first to the 506, an outstanding officer and leader that I respected and admired.

16
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:50.000
And this element from Delta Platoon had been in the field receiving fire and returning fire most in the morning, which was nothing new or nothing unusual.

17
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
But it had escalated.

18
00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.000
And I knew that there had been trouble and when the Colonel called me.

19
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.000
He told me that there had been a bad fight.

20
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:20.000
And then he went down the list of my men describing quickly what their wounds were and what their status was and pretty much telling me that they were going to be okay.

21
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Until he got to Mikey.

22
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:34.000
And I could hear a shift in his voice.

23
00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000
He became very grave and very serious.

24
00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
I could hear the sympathy in it.

25
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
And I knew what was coming.

26
00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.000
Mikey got hit bad.

27
00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
He got hit really bad, Jockel.

28
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
And I don't think he's going to make it.

29
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:26.000
In my heart jumped through my chest and then it sank back down to my stomach and then erupted into my brain in a madning rush of anger and horror and gut wrenching sadness.

30
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:45.000
And I grabbed all that insanity and all that emotion and I pulled it back into my mind and I held it down there while I uttered the only words that I could muster.

31
00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000
Roger that, sir.

32
00:04:50.000 --> 00:05:03.000
And when the Delta Platoon commander who's one of my best friends and a very close friend of Mikey's when he called me we were mechanical.

33
00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
We had worked to do.

34
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
He debriefed me.

35
00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.000
I listened.

36
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:21.000
We discussed the follow up and the next steps and the resupply and the operational impact of the casualties.

37
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:33.000
And the next day I talked to one of the seal officers that Mikey had saved.

38
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:41.000
I talked to him on the phone because he was in Germany already.

39
00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:49.000
With the other seal that had been wounded badly on the rooftop both of whom would have been dead if it hadn't been from Mikey.

40
00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.000
They were only wounded and because of that they were heading home.

41
00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:04.000
And when I talked to this young officer he explained to me what happened with perfect clarity.

42
00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.000
Mikey could have jumped away and saved himself but he did not.

43
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.000
His only movement was toward the grenade.

44
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.000
Mikey did not hesitate.

45
00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.000
What kind of a man does that?

46
00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:55.000
When I was a brand new guy at seal team one I began to learn and understand what kind of man did that.

47
00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:05.000
You see, as a young enlisted seal at seal team one there were two pictures on the quarter deck.

48
00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
Just two.

49
00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.000
The pictures were of seal team ones Medal of Honor recipients.

50
00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:21.000
Lieutenant Bob Carrey and Petty Officer second class Mike Thorden.

51
00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:34.000
And we young guys we memorized their names as well as the name of the seal team two Medal of Honor recipient Lieutenant Tom Norris.

52
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:43.000
And we read their citations over and over again and debrief them amongst ourselves.

53
00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:57.000
But we young enlisted seals we focused on on Mike Thorden.

54
00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:05.000
He was an enlisted man like we were.

55
00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:11.000
And we had heard about him.

56
00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:27.000
Then he was a legend not only for his actions but for his reputation as a seal as an operator as a leader as an all around badass frog man that we all aspired to be.

57
00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:35.000
As a young enlisted seal he was the mark he was the example.

58
00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
He was Mike Thorden.

59
00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:45.000
And a few months after checking into seal team one.

60
00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
I was in Virginia Beach.

61
00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:58.000
I was going to a school at the Navy base there on Little Creek and one day after work we went to a place called Papa's Pub.

62
00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:05.000
Now mind you I wasn't even old enough to get in but the the chief snuck me in there.

63
00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:17.000
And as we were sitting there having some food and talking a handful of other seals walked in and they were wearing their full dress choker whites.

64
00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:29.000
And one of them was a big monster of a man and he had a rack of ribbons up to his shoulder and the Medal of Honor around his neck and I knew exactly who it was.

65
00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.000
It was Mike Thorden.

66
00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:40.000
Right there in front of me the ultimate seal the ultimate hero standing there in the flesh.

67
00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:48.000
Then my chief looked and he saw how awestruck I was and he told me to go over there and say hi.

68
00:09:48.000 --> 00:10:06.000
And I was a new guy and I didn't have my tried it yet and at seal team one at the time as I have accounted over and over again we knew guys pretty much got treated like worthless scum.

69
00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:20.000
But when I introduce myself to Mike Thorden slap me on the back and said welcome to the teams and then he told me I'm from team one two.

70
00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:38.000
And then he bought me beer and treated me like I was his brother the man himself treating a pathetic new guy like me like I was one of his long lost buddies.

71
00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:50.000
And I never forgot that attitude and that humility.

72
00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:58.000
And I would see Mike Thorden occasionally over the years and I swear and always seemed like he remembered me at least in my mind.

73
00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:12.000
But years later he actually did get to know me a little bit when Mikey Montsource parents received the Medal of Honor from President Bush and the White House I was.

74
00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:38.000
And after that solemn ceremony. Well we went and we drank and we raised hell and we raised our glasses to Mikey into the rest of our fallen brothers and Mike Thorden treated me and the rest of our task unit.

75
00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.000
The same way he treated me when I first met him.

76
00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.000
Like we were all brothers.

77
00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000
And that night.

78
00:11:52.000 --> 00:12:06.000
Now that I had seen combat myself and seen with my own eyes the bravery and the selflessness and the sacrifice that is the very core of our community.

79
00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:13.000
I finally understood why Mike Thorden treated us all like brothers.

80
00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
It's because we were.

81
00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.000
And we are.

82
00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:31.000
And with that it is.

83
00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
On absolute honor to have.

84
00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
Here tonight.

85
00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:39.000
I hear him.

86
00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.000
A legend.

87
00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
A patriot.

88
00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:56.000
And someone I'm so proud to be able to call brother retired seal and Medal of Honor recipient Mike Thorden.

89
00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
Sir.

90
00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:01.000
Welcome aboard.

91
00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:02.000
Thanks, Chocca.

92
00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:04.000
Thanks, El.

93
00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
And my honor to be here too.

94
00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:14.000
I'm.

95
00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
I'm.

96
00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
I'm.

97
00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
I'm.

98
00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:28.000
I'm.

99
00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:30.000
I'm.

100
00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:38.000
I'm.

101
00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:40.000
I'm.

102
00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:45.000
I'm.

103
00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
I'm.

104
00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
I'm.

105
00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:53.000
I'm.

106
00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000
I'm.

107
00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
So.

108
00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
You recently had a book come out.

109
00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:03.000
Which is awesome.

110
00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:09.000
And you wrote it with your fellow teammate and and fellow Medal of Honor winner Tom Norris.

111
00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000
And also with another sealed dick couch.

112
00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000
And and the book is called by honor bound.

113
00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:19.000
And you know for me.

114
00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000
You know I was talking about this before the podcast before we started recording.

115
00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:37.000
You even though you want to know that get these really good debriefs in the seal teams and you think that there was a a fault with all these great debriefs and that explained to you everything that happened on certain missions, especially highly important missions.

116
00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000
You think that that existed, but it actually doesn't exist.

117
00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:55.000
And for me this book was like the detail debrief that I always wanted to have, you know, not only the operation that you did with Tommy, but also don't want that Tommy conducted by himself.

118
00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:10.000
And and both of them are just so well detailed in here and it's just a phenomenal book to get that kind of granular detail of what you live through that like I said, even being in the seal teams myself for 20 years.

119
00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:23.000
I never had as good of an understanding at all as I have these operations now so thank you for writing it and you know I want to dive into it a little bit because that's kind of what I do on this podcast is that I think it's better.

120
00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:34.000
And so it's you know I had to jump around a little bit, but just talking about your background and where you came from growing up in South Carolina.

121
00:15:34.000 --> 00:16:03.000
Yeah correct I was born and raised in the hills of South Carolina and my my father was my hero of all times you only had a six great education and my dad was in the Philippines from 39 and he got left in the Philippines after my carthip pulled out and he was one of the raiders over there they did a movie and I see he only had a six great education but he's a guy that everybody respected he had his own company and.

122
00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:17.000
I used to ask guys what you've been working for my father for 30 years you know he said because he and my dad always told me this and that's what I tried to do when I was in the team take care of your people your people will take care of you.

123
00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:31.000
And my mother gave us love and religion and and but daddy was hard as rocks and but you had the greatest respect for that man and everybody else and you my father had the same respect for him.

124
00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.000
Now you mentioned that your dad.

125
00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:42.000
You know had a six education obviously he was he was a hero to you in a successful guy and was able to put things together in his life.

126
00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:51.000
And well did he ever talk about what he did in the PI not until I had been wounded several times and during my second tour overseas and he said.

127
00:16:51.000 --> 00:17:01.000
He said I think you'll understand this and I said daddy I understood the first time I was ever wounded so.

128
00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:12.000
You know wounded in 1939 or wounded in 1969 or wounded in today's war I think it brings a reality that war sucks in what you look at it.

129
00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:23.000
Yeah there's no doubt about that I guess your dad wanted you to earn being able to hear good stories from him but you got to get wounded before I'm going to tell you to think more than one.

130
00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:25.000
That's a hard man right there.

131
00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:30.000
Now I'm going to the book a little bit this is you talking I didn't do that well in school.

132
00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:38.000
I couldn't read and I still have problems with it I'm dyslexic back then they didn't call it that you were just dumb.

133
00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:47.000
For me it meant that I simply couldn't keep up in school I did okay in math but that was probably the only thing I loved history otherwise I did poorly.

134
00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:58.000
I had to repeat myself more year in high school and that really hurt my pride so it's no wonder I got in with the wrong crowd and started getting into trouble nothing serious but we were mischievous.

135
00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:11.000
Southern country boys drinking beer and making bad decisions the sheriff was out the house a few times and there were was a time or two in juvenile court and I caught a lot of classes.

136
00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:18.000
I had 72 absences in my senior year in high school that's it pretty pretty legit record.

137
00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:45.000
Well you could only miss 30 in the automatically failed but I think they want to see me coming back so you know to that dyslexia and thank God we found out what it really is and actually I've never even read the book my wife read it to me five times and I'd make the changes and stuff like that but I do have it on tape and if I hear something I understand it but.

138
00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:50.000
I'm trying to say in that it's like young men know.

139
00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:57.000
You may have it tough but you can redo this so I've been a successful businessman.

140
00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:07.000
I went all the way through the ranks and I got a commission and I did this and I'm just trying to say there's only one in that's what I tell these kids when they go through training but you know that.

141
00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:17.000
I was only one person to go stop you and not sure so there's always to get across that obstacle under it around it on top of it one way the other so don't let something stop you.

142
00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:27.000
And and for you to move forward and make a better life for yourself and your family awesome awesome orders right there now speaking of.

143
00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:42.000
You know moving forward it's it's you had like the classic case of the judge telling you all right son you can either join the Navy or we're going to find a place that you're not going to like so much as home well I didn't know this.

144
00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:56.000
I was like 20 years later my father's probably told me him in the juvenile judge was a they were friends with each other and he said I'll let you make your first major decision go to juvenile.

145
00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:11.000
And you know juvenile hall or I could turn around and make the first major decision in my life and I'd saw that crazy movie the five Sullivan brothers turned wallwork to the nice other movie the Navy frogman with Richard workmark.

146
00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:24.000
And I turned around I said I've always wanted to be a UDT frogman and I've sluded and the guy the guy that in listed me was a second class machine to submit.

147
00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:39.000
And Ned his name was Ned Johnson and when he retired he was back as an eight nine he was the senior and listed for recruiting the state of South Carolina and he tells everybody I he made Mike Thornton who he was today.

148
00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:47.000
And that's that's then and so you come in and did you you just went boot camp and then straight to Buds or you guys didn't have Buds you guys called it.

149
00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:59.000
Underwater demolition recruit train I was supposed to go I was trying to go straight from there they said no we and you have to go to outside.

150
00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:16.000
And I like I say my dyslexia was pretty bad and I had to get a 10 point waiver just to get into the teams and they must have needed people pretty damn bad because I finally got my way around I was in Hawaii and I came back to corn I don't want to try and.

151
00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:31.000
And I was thinking about you know going through training here's here's a quote from you coming through training we had some instructors who are not only good teachers but they were real characters there was Vince a live era.

152
00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:45.000
Who is part American Indian and a plank holder at sealed team one he called us pale faces and we stood in awe and fear of instructor live here.

153
00:21:45.000 --> 00:22:00.000
And he went to the party with Muhammad Ali when Ali was asked once who hit him the hardest he said it was a chief petty officer in the in the US Navy named Dick Allen.

154
00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:14.000
And as his few is always watching us making sure everything we did was that we put out a hundred percent so what I was thinking about during this was when I went through I went through a ninety ninety one and there was.

155
00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:28.000
Clearly there were some rules in place but also the instructors kind of did what they wanted to and what the command wasn't watching there's clearly there's more rules and oversight now I've seen that with my own eyes.

156
00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:45.000
I can't even imagine what it was like when you were going through him at the instructors must have just been able to do whatever the hell they wanted to do to you guys. I tell you events all over the most sadistic son of a bitch ever met my life I tell you and I was just with Terry more the last two days of course this is reunion weekend.

157
00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:57.000
Terry still looks like a gladiator as he did back then and Dick Allen used to hang us from the pull up bar and he'd punch us in the stomach but I tell you if you didn't keep her hands loose.

158
00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:14.000
I mean if you didn't keep your hands loose he'd kill you and then of course the Dick and then events and Dick both have passed and but there there there memories and is a funny thing about life itself you know and it's not what you've done.

159
00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:30.000
This is the respect you want to gain from the teammates and Dick and Terry and events all grain game my respect and my love and they'll always always might thorns a lot of the stories will continue going on.

160
00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:39.000
That's what I want from my peers to remember who might thorn is and that's what those guys taught me.

161
00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:47.000
Yeah with those guys when those guys Vietnam vats where they Korean war vats both a little bit of everything.

162
00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:53.000
Vietnam vats and there's Tommy hatching in there too they used to call Tommy and I after I got the teams to solve pepper.

163
00:23:53.000 --> 00:24:05.96
He's great big old black guy and the strongest of damn ox and you know actually events was one of the original sales in 1962 and he went over to

164
00:24:05.96 --> 00:24:11.96
Vietnam or course back then they didn't know what they were doing with the sales and they're not pretty time.

165
00:24:11.96 --> 00:24:20.96
So you get done with buds and I'm going to the book here there were 22 guys who graduated in my class 18 from the original 129.

166
00:24:20.96 --> 00:24:29.96
I remember how lucky and proud I felt as I was given orders to seal team one even back then it was no small thing being a Navy seal.

167
00:24:29.96 --> 00:24:35.96
One thing to be a seal and yet another to do the work of the seal.

168
00:24:35.96 --> 00:24:44.96
I thought that was an important little highlight there of like when you get done with buds it's just the beginning really.

169
00:24:44.96 --> 00:24:47.96
Correct it's just you just cracked open the door.

170
00:24:47.96 --> 00:24:58.96
Then you got to go through the dam door and after you get through the door you got to prove yourself and like like you were saying we're a nobody back then you know if you had to have a couple of tours of it.

171
00:24:58.96 --> 00:25:01.96
You were just trash as far as over.

172
00:25:01.96 --> 00:25:16.96
Yeah so going to the book my first platoon was Charlie Patoon we were in country from 1969 through from December 1969 through July 1970 we worked out of a place called Don Island and it was a great deployment.

173
00:25:16.96 --> 00:25:27.96
We had solid platoon officers in our platoon pediah leading pediah officer was Barry Enoch one of the finest seal operators at team one when I made my first deployment he was my sea daddy.

174
00:25:27.96 --> 00:25:35.96
It was the same for all of us on our first combat tour and it was an active tour seems like every other night we'd be out most of the time we made contact.

175
00:25:35.96 --> 00:25:44.96
I remember we took down a few province level vehicle on cadre types and one time we had a good intelligence we were able to take down an entire VC grenade factory.

176
00:25:44.96 --> 00:25:53.96
It was great. So that was your first deployment when you talk about Barry Enoch and actually how Kukendall talks about as well.

177
00:25:53.96 --> 00:26:03.96
I says us as new guys even the veterans we worshiped Barry Enoch he was a great leader and a great teacher what was it about him that made him just that made you guys remember him and revere him so much.

178
00:26:03.96 --> 00:26:13.96
Well I think it's like you were talking about me and you're great in your dugs and which I don't deserve that but Barry was a leader he took care of everybody.

179
00:26:13.96 --> 00:26:42.96
He's a guy kind of like I looked up to my father he was my sea daddy and he was always there for all of us and me and last night Tom Boyhand and me and Wayne Hampton and Mike Lechraas and how Kirkendall we're all getting a picture together and then remembering the great guys and we're all we're talking about Barry of course Barry fell past the way a few years ago and he's another guy you know it's like I say.

180
00:26:42.96 --> 00:26:49.96
He'll always been all our conversations and somebody we all looked up to you know.

181
00:26:49.96 --> 00:27:00.96
It's a great leadership I mean he showed us and not just the leadership as a leader but the leadership he showed us to try be a better person.

182
00:27:00.96 --> 00:27:11.96
And that deployment what were you guys doing you guys were doing we guys deploying off of boats were you guys going in helicopters you guys going on foot patrols a little bit everything a little bit everything foot patrols basically sand pans.

183
00:27:11.96 --> 00:27:30.96
The wailers by that time we finally got the LSS Cs which were in the late and then the medium support seal support craft course we had the mighty mo a lot of our stuff was the mighty mo it was a Mike big Mike and then and had the you see it had all the.

184
00:27:30.96 --> 00:27:41.96
Rebarb about 20 inches out so if you got hit by an RNG it exploded there instead of going through the whole we did a lot of like I was working down that.

185
00:27:41.96 --> 00:27:56.96
And then the C flow was to the first with the KCS is because back then we didn't have that many seals so we would help each other we if they say we need help we'd.

186
00:27:56.96 --> 00:28:11.96
And then we would send the guys that need help should be going so we'd like rich solano myself and a bunch of the guys we'd go out and help other patents and stuff and were you a 60 gunner.

187
00:28:11.96 --> 00:28:27.96
And then we would carry a car 15 but always care to Swedish K with me all the time on a pistol all is that back up.

188
00:28:27.96 --> 00:28:54.96
That's what we had that I got a grenade factory Mike he's saying is jumped out and he had a 60 he didn't lock down he didn't lock down his as hitch and his is jumped out of the boat is barrel fell out and the water in the river and he's down there digging he's yelling give me one of your guns as a hell no I'm keeping all my guns.

189
00:28:54.96 --> 00:29:15.96
And we all learned and Mike was a great M60 guy he saved our ass as many times and everybody did their job is just as you were saying while he was a team effort and my life was saved by people like Mike Lecos and other people in our pertinent and we backed each other up all the time.

190
00:29:15.96 --> 00:29:30.96
And that was a super active actually how how Kirk and all it was talking about you here in the book this is how talking I can remember more than one firefight where we were shooting and ducking sometimes more ducking than shooting.

191
00:29:30.96 --> 00:29:45.96
But Mike would be right there working that 60 with a big grin on his face there were plenty of times when I was really scared but I'm not sure Mike ever was. He was reliable and brave but I'm not sure he ever knew or understood fear like the rest of us.

192
00:29:45.96 --> 00:30:00.96
He was a great teammate and my god he was strong none of us could believe how much ammo he carried sometimes he'd go out with a thousand rounds or more that's close to 80 pounds of just ammo and he'd swim canals with that load.

193
00:30:00.96 --> 00:30:16.96
Just shrug and say you don't want your 60 gunner run out of ammo do you we got through a pretty active deployment with no one getting killed. Then a couple of guys stayed behind to break in the new platoon while the rest of us packed up and left.

194
00:30:16.96 --> 00:30:34.96
They were two of our best and one of them was killed in a helo crash with three other seals. We took it hard when rich Solano was killed but I think Mike took it the hardest Mike was a guy who really cared for his teammates.

195
00:30:34.96 --> 00:31:03.96
So even with all that action you guys went through the deployment with you know what did you take a few wounded guys but nobody was killed and actually we were always down at sea float and rich Solano was working with a gulf platoon I think and that was when the helicopter went down and of course when you come off a hot LZ you're supposed to shut down your aircraft and check the rotor blades because back then the rotor blades could have a hole and it could last for two years.

196
00:31:03.96 --> 00:31:28.96
It could last for thirty minutes or forty five or an hour and the the pilot the helo when you get back for birthday party or something and the helo found and actually rich was killed and Dirlin was killed and Toby Thomas was killed.

197
00:31:28.96 --> 00:31:54.96
The helo and the helo was there. Gardner was killed so that was one of our biggest we lost five guys that they not four we lost five and I went down and identified the bodies and it was you know I only had one bad dream of my whole life and it was after identifying that because rich whole face was completely gone and the way I could identify me he had a scorer on his arm.

198
00:31:54.96 --> 00:32:11.96
But you know a loss of any team mate as you know as well as I do that like Mikey and and every time you know every time I lose even a new kid today which I've been out speaking to their class and stuff like that you lose a little bit more your heart.

199
00:32:11.96 --> 00:32:25.96
I've got to know how much more of my heart I got to lose but it takes it out of it I mean it is I don't want to see anybody ever get hurt or especially a loss of a loved one and they're all.

200
00:32:25.96 --> 00:32:35.96
Their their life for just as important to me with the new kids today has rich and all those guys were important to me back then.

201
00:32:35.96 --> 00:32:41.96
You you come home from that deployment and you go into a.

202
00:32:41.96 --> 00:32:43.96
Seal team one.

203
00:32:43.96 --> 00:32:56.96
Codray which we actually have talked about on here with Roger Hayden because we still we when I was a at Seal team one and I was in training cell we still called at cadre and that was I don't know 20 something years later and I never even.

204
00:32:56.96 --> 00:33:13.96
I've made the connection and Roger and I talked about the fact that you know some of the training that you guys implemented back there the the point man course we're walking through and the trip wires are there and all that we still did that a lot of the demo we still did.

205
00:33:13.96 --> 00:33:23.96
But that's what you did when you got home you went into that training cell being cadre and teaching and you know you mentioned here that you learned a lot being instructor and I always.

206
00:33:23.96 --> 00:33:32.96
I was agree with that in fact when when I was in the sealed teams no one wanted to go the training department right we all wanted to just deploy just deploy just deploy so when I took over the training.

207
00:33:32.96 --> 00:33:39.96
I always told guys look if you want to be you know if you want to master what you do you got to go and teach it.

208
00:33:39.96 --> 00:33:45.96
You know you also mentioned al hui in here and when I went through buds.

209
00:33:45.96 --> 00:33:56.96
When we were at San Clemente Island every night when the sun goes down we'd sing the song good night al hui good night al hui good night al hui wherever you may be and I never knew.

210
00:33:56.96 --> 00:33:59.96
And still don't know who al hui is.

211
00:33:59.96 --> 00:34:00.96
I don't know you.

212
00:34:00.96 --> 00:34:09.96
Other than the campus called al hui it's called camp al hui out there and honestly I make my kids sing this song when the sun goes down.

213
00:34:09.96 --> 00:34:12.96
My me and my kids we sing this song.

214
00:34:12.96 --> 00:34:21.96
I'm sure you've heard a day shibley come to our shibley and Alan and Dave were best friends and.

215
00:34:21.96 --> 00:34:35.96
I was another mentor like Barry not to me and they went through class two of UDT back in the 50s and never of all in Korean stuff and he led by example again you know but.

216
00:34:35.96 --> 00:34:42.96
I mean it's kind of like when he talks better be like EF Hut better be listening keeping your ears wide open and just.

217
00:34:42.96 --> 00:35:08.96
And then you you from cadre you had a chance you went back and deployed again but you went to Thailand and we can teach in the Thai seals we took train the Thai seals I was along with Dick Flanagan and one of the finest officers as Tom Boyan was.

218
00:35:08.96 --> 00:35:25.96
Great officer great leader and hours with us on that that's reason why Alan I were so close and we train the Thai UDT and the Silt team textures and then they went up and the work of the borders.

219
00:35:25.96 --> 00:35:27.96
So that's all I can say about that.

220
00:35:27.96 --> 00:35:32.96
Yeah and understood and then you got home from that.

221
00:35:32.96 --> 00:35:40.96
I looked like the war in Vietnam was kind of winding down and there weren't full seal patterns deploying anymore no more silpitans on the basically what we were doing over.

222
00:35:40.96 --> 00:35:50.96
We were sending in listed LDNN advisors and like a bunch of the guys that were over there with me on that tour was.

223
00:35:50.96 --> 00:36:02.96
It was at the reunion and it was kind of funny to get together and and talk with all of them you know and talk about.

224
00:36:02.96 --> 00:36:05.96
But we've lost a lot of those guys which have passed through age or cancer or something and you know.

225
00:36:05.96 --> 00:36:13.96
It's just one of the things about the reunion you know none of us are getting any damage under so you better get out and see your shipmates any time you get a chance.

226
00:36:13.96 --> 00:36:28.96
Yeah. The LDNN you mentioned and just to everyone knows what that those are like Vietnamese south Vietnamese seals and the LDN is just for loing and die is what it actually in Vietnamese.

227
00:36:28.96 --> 00:36:30.96
What does that mean like a warrior from the sea or something like that?

228
00:36:30.96 --> 00:36:32.96
Yeah, it's just a type of yeah.

229
00:36:32.96 --> 00:36:42.96
So you get a chance to go back again and this is funny because typical seal you know it's like oh we need to go back on to point again yes I'll go.

230
00:36:42.96 --> 00:36:43.96
Yeah.

231
00:36:43.96 --> 00:36:56.96
I'm going back to the book so when I got to Vietnam this time I spent close to a week at Nautrain working with the LDNNs there getting a feel for the what they were doing in the field.

232
00:36:56.96 --> 00:37:03.96
I'd work with the Vietnamese seals on my first tour back in 1969 and I saw a few familiar faces.

233
00:37:03.96 --> 00:37:14.96
You have to hand it to those guys for them there were no combat rotations life was combat 24 seven year in year out.

234
00:37:14.96 --> 00:37:22.96
They fought until they were killed or as it worked out in the end we lost the war.

235
00:37:22.96 --> 00:37:32.96
So those are the guys you're working with and I think it's I mean you get into the relationship that you formed with these guys which was you know they were all their brothers.

236
00:37:32.96 --> 00:37:43.96
Yep, they were that you took care of them they took care of you and of course the reason I feel that Tommy and I still love today is cause of dain and quon which I explained the book they were.

237
00:37:43.96 --> 00:37:53.96
I'd work with them on previous chores and many operations and they were there there just like one of us I mean they took care of me so that's reason I hand picked those two guys.

238
00:37:53.96 --> 00:37:55.96
That was dain and quon.

239
00:37:55.96 --> 00:37:57.96
Those were those guys that you had worked with before.

240
00:37:57.96 --> 00:37:58.96
Yeah.

241
00:37:58.96 --> 00:38:03.96
Vietnamese seals and so you get to a two-in-one I'm saying that right.

242
00:38:03.96 --> 00:38:04.96
Two-in-one.

243
00:38:04.96 --> 00:38:05.96
Two-in-one.

244
00:38:05.96 --> 00:38:09.96
Okay, so you get to two-in-one this is where you're going to be working out of and again you're not in the seal.

245
00:38:09.96 --> 00:38:19.96
This is a totally different situation and what you had there in two-in-one if I gathered it all correctly you had five in listed seals from seal team one.

246
00:38:19.96 --> 00:38:30.96
And then you had two seal team two officers and in plus with those two seal team two officers who were sound like they were more junior guys maybe it was their first deployment.

247
00:38:30.96 --> 00:38:35.96
But then Tommy Norris showed up as well as the OEC.

248
00:38:35.96 --> 00:38:36.96
Yeah.

249
00:38:36.96 --> 00:38:48.96
Shively captain, Tom Norris Shively, he had all the seals, UD, EOD, divers everybody and then Tommy Nelson was our lieutenant commander in O3 and he was the head of all the seals.

250
00:38:48.96 --> 00:38:56.96
Tommy was the senior seal operator in the country then we had Ryan McCombie and another lieutenant.

251
00:38:56.96 --> 00:38:57.96
It was there.

252
00:38:57.96 --> 00:39:01.96
There were all East Coast guys.

253
00:39:01.96 --> 00:39:17.96
Now we had, actually I think we had more like 18 in listed guys and we broke it up and Gary Gare,

254
00:39:17.96 --> 00:39:25.96
Chamberlain and Harry Conacula went with Lieutenant Houth down one thing.

255
00:39:25.96 --> 00:39:45.96
Then Ryan McCombie was our boss and I stayed up and so everybody had had many tours that went down south and I had the most tours and I stayed up north with Ryan McCombie then Tommy would go back and forth to run operations of course.

256
00:39:45.96 --> 00:39:59.96
It was hard to get aOs approved because you know it was pretty at that time we were fighting in Quantrie and Wacity and all that stuff and they were trying to overtake it but we're still able to get our ops and.

257
00:39:59.96 --> 00:40:06.96
And you had what two squads of LDNN and what made up a squad of LDNN?

258
00:40:06.96 --> 00:40:15.96
I think we had we had more LDNNs than we did but we separated those guys too.

259
00:40:15.96 --> 00:40:24.96
I know when we went on the operation, Woody was we always had a seal as you know on an insertion extraction craft and Woody had a.

260
00:40:24.96 --> 00:40:31.96
We only had three LDNNs on the up with us but he had another six or eight on the boat.

261
00:40:31.96 --> 00:40:46.96
If we needed to resupply. So and and and I got to mention this because again it's half the book of by underbound is we've been throwing Tommy Norris's name around here and when he showed up to work with you guys.

262
00:40:46.96 --> 00:40:54.96
He had been in country for some period of time and he had done this this multiple pilot rescue operations.

263
00:40:54.96 --> 00:41:01.96
The bat 21 mission in Tommy was.

264
00:41:01.96 --> 00:41:15.96
I say that I knew about his reputation and he knew about my reputation and it was kind of funny Tommy and I don't you're operated one time and that was that operation but we were of course still best of friends and.

265
00:41:15.96 --> 00:41:25.96
We resumitted Tommy was put in for a metal and it was resumitted and then he was upgraded to the metal of honor later on and.

266
00:41:25.96 --> 00:41:29.96
Greatest friend and he made it a rasp for and.

267
00:41:29.96 --> 00:41:41.96
I look back on the officers at the leadership we had on like I was saying Tom Boyhead and Captain Shabley and and Tommy and Ryan McCombie and and and Norm Carley and I'm.

268
00:41:41.96 --> 00:41:53.96
You know even when we were in six with more sink oh and stuff like that it was we had some great leaders you know and all those guys took care of their people that's what I really.

269
00:41:53.96 --> 00:42:02.96
Looked up to them for always being there for the troops you know they made to your ass up but nobody else is calling to.

270
00:42:02.96 --> 00:42:15.96
And that once Tommy shows up they you get the start getting the mission tasking for this mission that becomes you know the mission and the Paris peace talks were going on.

271
00:42:15.96 --> 00:42:28.96
But you know Tom Thomas saying that there's no at the operational level you guys were like oh that's great but it's not changing anything for us on the ground meanwhile they're you know they're attacking way city and it's just.

272
00:42:28.96 --> 00:42:33.96
And so. Tom goes down he gets called down by by the Commodore.

273
00:42:33.96 --> 00:42:36.96
Shabley Shabley to.

274
00:42:36.96 --> 00:42:44.96
To get a mission tasking and this is this is Tom Norris talking Uncle Dave had me take a seat in his office.

275
00:42:44.96 --> 00:42:46.96
That's what that's what you guys call the Commodore.

276
00:42:46.96 --> 00:42:47.96
Yeah, I'll be late.

277
00:42:47.96 --> 00:42:51.96
I never called any of my Commodore is an uncle at least not to their faces.

278
00:42:51.96 --> 00:43:02.96
Uncle Dave had me take a seat in his office and I could tell he had something on his mind Tom he said the Vietnamese commander of the LDNN wants to run a seal reconnaissance mission to the mouth.

279
00:43:02.96 --> 00:43:03.96
Of the.

280
00:43:03.96 --> 00:43:29.96
The.

281
00:43:29.96 --> 00:43:34.96
The.

282
00:43:34.96 --> 00:43:35.96
So that was the tasking doing the reconnaissance correct pretty normal operation.

283
00:43:35.96 --> 00:43:39.96
I'm it's pretty standard it sounds like you guys were running those type of operations fairly regularly.

284
00:43:39.96 --> 00:43:46.96
Yeah, basically the NVA had already moved across the quave at river so that was the we knew that and we knew.

285
00:43:46.96 --> 00:43:58.96
And they were trying to take over quantity again and and they attacked on way city that was in April and this was an October and this thing was going down so we knew was hot and heavy up there but.

286
00:43:58.96 --> 00:44:06.96
I thought Tom he said yes, you know, you never said no to uncle Dave.

287
00:44:06.96 --> 00:44:12.96
And so you guys decide or Tom, you know, let's you know, hey, let's do a small small group you're going to take five guys.

288
00:44:12.96 --> 00:44:13.96
Sure.

289
00:44:13.96 --> 00:44:15.96
Two Americans and three Vietnamese.

290
00:44:15.96 --> 00:44:16.96
All right.

291
00:44:16.96 --> 00:44:25.96
Obviously the two are you and Tom Norris and then the three the three guys that you're going to take with you the three Vietnamese that you're going to take with you.

292
00:44:25.96 --> 00:44:28.96
Two of them were your hands selected guys.

293
00:44:28.96 --> 00:44:29.96
Yeah, Juan.

294
00:44:29.96 --> 00:44:33.96
And then there was another officer the other guy was an officer right.

295
00:44:33.96 --> 00:44:33.96
Great.

296
00:44:33.96 --> 00:44:37.96
And he was lieutenant. I've heard you tell the story in here.

297
00:44:37.96 --> 00:44:39.96
He's called Lieutenant Juan.

298
00:44:39.96 --> 00:44:40.96
Yeah, we got a story.

299
00:44:40.96 --> 00:44:41.96
You were called Ty.

300
00:44:41.96 --> 00:44:43.96
Well, yeah, but we put a different name in there.

301
00:44:43.96 --> 00:44:46.96
But calls he kind of made the operation.

302
00:44:46.96 --> 00:44:47.96
Co-south.

303
00:44:47.96 --> 00:44:48.96
Got it.

304
00:44:48.96 --> 00:44:49.96
Got it.

305
00:44:49.96 --> 00:44:51.96
Uh,

306
00:44:51.96 --> 00:44:55.96
So here's the basic concept of operations.

307
00:44:55.96 --> 00:44:57.96
Well, it's really the funny part of it.

308
00:44:57.96 --> 00:44:59.96
Tom, he said, I'll do the mission.

309
00:44:59.96 --> 00:45:01.96
If you let me choose who I want to take.

310
00:45:01.96 --> 00:45:02.96
Oh, gosh.

311
00:45:02.96 --> 00:45:06.96
Back then we had a rotation basically where everybody could have chance to go in the field.

312
00:45:06.96 --> 00:45:10.96
And with always went in the field with the new guys and stuff.

313
00:45:10.96 --> 00:45:15.96
And he said, I'd like to make a choice in uncle Dave said, well,

314
00:45:15.96 --> 00:45:17.96
I bet you I know who it is.

315
00:45:17.96 --> 00:45:20.96
And he said, well, we've never operated together.

316
00:45:20.96 --> 00:45:21.96
So I bet just might thorn.

317
00:45:21.96 --> 00:45:25.96
And he said, yes sir, that's who I want to take with me on an operation.

318
00:45:25.96 --> 00:45:29.96
And actually Woody was supposed to be going in on that operation.

319
00:45:29.96 --> 00:45:36.96
And, but we took Woody on the, the insertion extraction means a transportation.

320
00:45:36.96 --> 00:45:40.96
And that's, that's Bill Woodruff Woodruff who you talking about.

321
00:45:40.96 --> 00:45:41.96
Yeah.

322
00:45:41.96 --> 00:45:44.96
And we'll get into what his role was.

323
00:45:44.96 --> 00:45:47.96
Here's the, here's the overview of the mission.

324
00:45:47.96 --> 00:45:49.96
And this is Tom Norris talking to us.

325
00:45:49.96 --> 00:45:51.96
And it was not a particularly difficult mission.

326
00:45:51.96 --> 00:45:53.96
And it was certainly something we'd done before.

327
00:45:53.96 --> 00:45:55.96
So we knew the drill in general.

328
00:45:55.96 --> 00:46:04.96
It was about a 50 mile transit from two Enon up the Kuivette river in our boats with a max speed of about eight knots.

329
00:46:04.96 --> 00:46:07.96
That was a little more than six hours.

330
00:46:07.96 --> 00:46:08.96
So you're talking about a six hour transit.

331
00:46:08.96 --> 00:46:10.96
The plan was to get well out to see.

332
00:46:10.96 --> 00:46:13.96
So no one on the beach could know which direction we were heading north or south.

333
00:46:13.96 --> 00:46:16.96
Once we turned in this case north, we'd make our way up the coast.

334
00:46:16.96 --> 00:46:19.96
Then turn west back into shore.

335
00:46:19.96 --> 00:46:25.96
Then we hope to be on station off the southern bank of the Kuivette river.

336
00:46:25.96 --> 00:46:28.96
Soon as possible after dark.

337
00:46:28.96 --> 00:46:33.96
We'd then leave the junks and paddle in close to shore and rubber boats.

338
00:46:33.96 --> 00:46:37.96
And then swim the last swim ashore from the rubber boats.

339
00:46:37.96 --> 00:46:41.96
We'd insert, do our job and get out before first light.

340
00:46:41.96 --> 00:46:44.96
We didn't have to be back at two Enon before first light.

341
00:46:44.96 --> 00:46:49.96
But we sure as heck wanted to be back across the beach and away from the coast before sun up.

342
00:46:49.96 --> 00:46:54.96
I was told I'd have offshore Navy support in the way of two destroyers.

343
00:46:54.96 --> 00:46:59.96
So if we're running a little late and getting out of there, I'd have some friendly on call fire support.

344
00:46:59.96 --> 00:47:07.96
So that's a real standard mission that, you know, when I first got the team one, we did that not not the exact same thing and not real.

345
00:47:07.96 --> 00:47:08.96
But we trained it all the time.

346
00:47:08.96 --> 00:47:13.96
You're going to get on mark five's and you're going to have your ZODAX on there that you're going to get a little closer to the beach.

347
00:47:13.96 --> 00:47:16.96
And when you get close to the beach, you drop off the ZODAX.

348
00:47:16.96 --> 00:47:18.96
Then you get a little bit closer to the beach.

349
00:47:18.96 --> 00:47:20.96
And then the last thing you do is get out the boats, swim in.

350
00:47:20.96 --> 00:47:21.96
You go to your operation.

351
00:47:21.96 --> 00:47:23.96
So kind of standard stuff.

352
00:47:23.96 --> 00:47:26.96
And you know, he says it's not something you hadn't done before.

353
00:47:26.96 --> 00:47:27.96
All right.

354
00:47:27.96 --> 00:47:34.96
Here's what you were talking about when you're talking about the LDNNs.

355
00:47:34.96 --> 00:47:36.96
Going back to the book.

356
00:47:36.96 --> 00:47:40.96
The LDNs came in all varieties of experience and capability and courage.

357
00:47:40.96 --> 00:47:43.96
On this operation, we had three very good ones.

358
00:47:43.96 --> 00:47:48.96
Lieutenant Kwon was a first rate LDNN officer and dang and Kwon.

359
00:47:48.96 --> 00:47:51.96
This other Kwon is an elicited LLNN.

360
00:47:51.96 --> 00:47:52.96
No relation.

361
00:47:52.96 --> 00:47:53.96
We're two guys.

362
00:47:53.96 --> 00:47:57.96
I'd work with on my first tour and was with them again in two and on.

363
00:47:57.96 --> 00:48:00.96
Dang and Kwon were good to go.

364
00:48:00.96 --> 00:48:03.96
But the problem was Kwon the officer.

365
00:48:03.96 --> 00:48:05.96
Well, Kwon was hurt.

366
00:48:05.96 --> 00:48:07.96
And that's the reason you have to.

367
00:48:07.96 --> 00:48:13.96
Yeah, the problem was that Lieutenant Kwon, he liked to get after a little bit sometimes.

368
00:48:13.96 --> 00:48:15.96
Well, it's like all of us.

369
00:48:15.96 --> 00:48:19.96
Maybe he had too much to drink the night before.

370
00:48:19.96 --> 00:48:23.96
And so he would he get now some kind of accident or whatever.

371
00:48:23.96 --> 00:48:27.96
Yeah, he was riding it in a way or ran into the pier.

372
00:48:27.96 --> 00:48:32.96
He had this head and he busted both his eyes and he couldn't see his.

373
00:48:32.96 --> 00:48:34.96
They're both completely shut.

374
00:48:34.96 --> 00:48:38.96
Well, this is how we got the other new officer, which I've never worked with.

375
00:48:38.96 --> 00:48:41.96
But but I'd work many tours.

376
00:48:41.96 --> 00:48:45.96
I mean, not many tours, but many operations with the other two guys.

377
00:48:45.96 --> 00:48:48.96
And I'd work with Kwon and he was really good.

378
00:48:48.96 --> 00:48:50.96
But of course he was unable to make the.

379
00:48:50.96 --> 00:48:55.96
So they, we brought in another young officer, which I'd never operated with.

380
00:48:55.96 --> 00:48:58.96
And this other just so everyone knows as we're going through this.

381
00:48:58.96 --> 00:49:01.96
The other officer that you now brought on that you had to work with before.

382
00:49:01.96 --> 00:49:03.96
His name was Lieutenant Fwan.

383
00:49:03.96 --> 00:49:04.96
Yeah.

384
00:49:04.96 --> 00:49:05.96
Is that in my saying that right?

385
00:49:05.96 --> 00:49:07.96
No, but I'm not going to be a crew man.

386
00:49:07.96 --> 00:49:13.96
I got the Vietnamese speaker in here, typing me up.

387
00:49:13.96 --> 00:49:21.96
So you had the the Navy was out to see the two things that Navy was supposed to help you with was helping you guys do navigation.

388
00:49:21.96 --> 00:49:24.96
Because in this time, no GPS, it's so easy now.

389
00:49:24.96 --> 00:49:26.96
I'm embarrassed by how you see this.

390
00:49:26.96 --> 00:49:30.96
And obviously fire support if you need it.

391
00:49:30.96 --> 00:49:38.96
Yeah. Basically what they're supposed to do is vector is sand and that's where each ship takes a radar plunge and they shoot it in.

392
00:49:38.96 --> 00:49:47.96
And they see where we are in the junks, which are 39 foot concrete junks is what the.

393
00:49:47.96 --> 00:49:49.96
And then they would see where we were.

394
00:49:49.96 --> 00:49:51.96
Then they'd shoot us at Asmoth.

395
00:49:51.96 --> 00:49:54.96
And then we would take our compass and we'd go in there.

396
00:49:54.96 --> 00:49:58.96
One of the ship shooting is they were trying to overtake Kwon tree again.

397
00:49:58.96 --> 00:50:03.96
And he left and went down south to help you have gone far support.

398
00:50:03.96 --> 00:50:10.96
To help the Vietnamese army and Marine Corps to hold off the NVA.

399
00:50:10.96 --> 00:50:18.96
And when that one guy shot the Asmoth and he was about 3 degrees off, but when you're 15 miles off the beach.

400
00:50:18.96 --> 00:50:20.96
3 degrees is a lot.

401
00:50:20.96 --> 00:50:30.96
And everybody said the CEO said that's the river. Actually it was the Ben Haar River, which was actually in North Vietnam.

402
00:50:30.96 --> 00:50:35.96
So when we went and inserted, we were way north of the Kwon via.

403
00:50:35.96 --> 00:50:42.96
Now you had talked about Bill Woodruff Woody, you're referring to him as an important point here.

404
00:50:42.96 --> 00:50:45.96
And this is something we always tried to hold true to.

405
00:50:45.96 --> 00:50:50.96
You won't always put like a seal with your assets if you can manage it.

406
00:50:50.96 --> 00:50:56.96
So you got a seal out there on the boats that are going to be recovering you because it's a guy that you know it's a guy that you trust.

407
00:50:56.96 --> 00:50:58.96
And you know, these not going to leave you hanging there.

408
00:50:58.96 --> 00:51:00.96
Yeah, you're saying that's right.

409
00:51:00.96 --> 00:51:04.96
And you know, that's a good lesson learned for anybody doing operations right now.

410
00:51:04.96 --> 00:51:07.96
I don't care what unit you're with. If you're in the Marine Corps and you're using the army asset,

411
00:51:07.96 --> 00:51:09.96
trying to put a liaison officer with the army.

412
00:51:09.96 --> 00:51:12.96
If you're in the army and you're using the Marine Corps asset, try and put a liaison officer.

413
00:51:12.96 --> 00:51:16.96
Same thing with special operations because those are the guys that speak your language.

414
00:51:16.96 --> 00:51:20.96
They're going to be able to predict what you're going to do if things are going sideways.

415
00:51:20.96 --> 00:51:23.96
It's just it's just a smart move to do.

416
00:51:23.96 --> 00:51:27.96
And then you know, you talked about how these things started going wrong.

417
00:51:27.96 --> 00:51:29.96
And you're off the coast.

418
00:51:29.96 --> 00:51:37.96
And instead of being where you thought you were, you're at the Ben Heir River, which is basically south of the Ben Heir.

419
00:51:37.96 --> 00:51:43.96
So we, and Tommy and I discussed it and he said, we'll go ahead and go in.

420
00:51:43.96 --> 00:51:53.96
We'll do what we call a horseshoe out. We'll go in so many clicks and go north and then go back to the east back to the ocean and try to if we can pick up.

421
00:51:53.96 --> 00:51:57.96
You know, if we could do it, we were doing a body snatch too.

422
00:51:57.96 --> 00:52:02.96
Of course, of course, by a body snatch you get your best intelligence that way.

423
00:52:02.96 --> 00:52:10.96
And then we used to do direct action missions to go capture bad guys, but we didn't call them body snatches.

424
00:52:10.96 --> 00:52:16.96
And I'm kind of wishing we did. It sounds a lot better than to a body snatch.

425
00:52:16.96 --> 00:52:20.96
Maybe I should have named those body snatch and operations.

426
00:52:20.96 --> 00:52:22.96
I would have felt a lot better about it.

427
00:52:22.96 --> 00:52:26.96
So in tactically, you're going in.

428
00:52:26.96 --> 00:52:28.96
It's pretty normal.

429
00:52:28.96 --> 00:52:32.96
You swim in. It's pretty normal. You get on the beach.

430
00:52:32.96 --> 00:52:42.96
And here we go back to the book. This is Utah. And I was carrying the Starlight scope, a bulky first generation night vision device that allowed you to see relatively well at night.

431
00:52:42.96 --> 00:52:46.96
There's a size of a loaf of bread and weighed eight pounds.

432
00:52:46.96 --> 00:52:50.96
Tommy told me to scout the beach area to see if I could find any of the features we were looking for,

433
00:52:50.96 --> 00:52:52.96
expecting to find like the mouth of the river.

434
00:52:52.96 --> 00:52:56.96
I went north about 200 yards from our position in the same distance to the south.

435
00:52:56.96 --> 00:53:00.96
And with the Starlight scope, I could see a good ways up and down the beach.

436
00:53:00.96 --> 00:53:02.96
No river mouth and nothing looked familiar.

437
00:53:02.96 --> 00:53:06.96
Tommy moved inland just to short distance to look the area over with his binoculars.

438
00:53:06.96 --> 00:53:10.96
Neither of us saw anything that indicated we were supposed to be.

439
00:53:10.96 --> 00:53:14.96
So, and then like you said, you know you're in the wrong space,

440
00:53:14.96 --> 00:53:16.96
but you might as well do in reconnaissance while you're there.

441
00:53:16.96 --> 00:53:20.96
And that's kind of the decision that's made.

442
00:53:20.96 --> 00:53:22.96
And I was thinking about this too.

443
00:53:22.96 --> 00:53:26.96
So I was thinking you guys only have five guys.

444
00:53:26.96 --> 00:53:30.96
And the idea behind that must have been, hey, let's travel light and we can maneuver really quick.

445
00:53:30.96 --> 00:53:34.96
And then I got to the list of what you were carrying.

446
00:53:34.96 --> 00:53:36.96
Here's what Mike was carrying. Mike talking, I was the muel.

447
00:53:36.96 --> 00:53:44.96
On a recon patrol, I carried a car 15, car being, and just over 800 rounds of five five six ammunition,

448
00:53:44.96 --> 00:53:50.96
along with an assortment of the dozen fragmentation CS and smoke grenades.

449
00:53:50.96 --> 00:53:54.96
I also had three law rockets and a starlight scope, all this carried a medical kit,

450
00:53:54.96 --> 00:53:58.96
and inflatable UDT over the head life vest.

451
00:53:58.96 --> 00:54:04.96
I also had our silenced weapon of 22 caliber automatic pistol with a suppressor attached to the barrel.

452
00:54:04.96 --> 00:54:06.96
We called it a hush puppy.

453
00:54:06.96 --> 00:54:10.96
So, not exactly light for reconnaissance and moving.

454
00:54:10.96 --> 00:54:16.96
I was thinking you guys would try and stay all slick, but that's no joke what you were carrying.

455
00:54:16.96 --> 00:54:24.96
Now, as your patrol and you start seeing fires, and eventually you see movement, you see bunkers,

456
00:54:24.96 --> 00:54:28.96
and Tommy says, I think it's about time we get the heck out of here.

457
00:54:28.96 --> 00:54:30.96
You say Roger that sir.

458
00:54:30.96 --> 00:54:32.96
It's about 0-300.

459
00:54:32.96 --> 00:54:36.96
You got about three hours of darkness left, and you get into a stream.

460
00:54:36.96 --> 00:54:37.96
Right.

461
00:54:37.96 --> 00:54:40.96
And start moving towards the beach.

462
00:54:40.96 --> 00:54:44.96
Well, for three different reasons, one of the Kitchell low cell, solar wet.

463
00:54:44.96 --> 00:54:48.96
We knew that we were within a battalion of NVA at that period of time.

464
00:54:48.96 --> 00:54:52.96
Then we saw tanks and gun-in-placements.

465
00:54:52.96 --> 00:54:56.96
So, we knew that we were way north of the world was supposed to be.

466
00:54:56.96 --> 00:55:02.96
So, by getting in the stream, the tide ranges 18 feet over there.

467
00:55:02.96 --> 00:55:06.96
So, the current was running out, so we knew it was going out to the ocean.

468
00:55:06.96 --> 00:55:08.96
So, we got in there.

469
00:55:08.96 --> 00:55:12.96
By keeping our low solar wet in there, we can move a lot faster in the water,

470
00:55:12.96 --> 00:55:18.96
and hopefully we wouldn't bump into any of the enemy out there,

471
00:55:18.96 --> 00:55:24.96
which we were starting to move around at that time in the morning.

472
00:55:24.96 --> 00:55:30.96
Now you start hearing something.

473
00:55:30.96 --> 00:55:32.96
Correct.

474
00:55:32.96 --> 00:55:40.96
And, you know, you halt patrol, and you see what you see is NVA soldiers, a bunch of them.

475
00:55:40.96 --> 00:55:44.96
It's like an encampment of NVA soldiers.

476
00:55:44.96 --> 00:55:48.96
And they correct me if I'm wrong, but from their position,

477
00:55:48.96 --> 00:55:52.96
where you had moved to in the stream, now you're looking at them,

478
00:55:52.96 --> 00:55:56.96
and as you move to the water, you're going to be exposed.

479
00:55:56.96 --> 00:55:58.96
Is that the situation?

480
00:55:58.96 --> 00:56:02.96
Well, actually, there were in a base camp type deal, and it was a quick reaction force.

481
00:56:02.96 --> 00:56:04.96
We knew the main forces behind us.

482
00:56:04.96 --> 00:56:12.96
And, of course, that exposed us, kind of cut off our southern route.

483
00:56:12.96 --> 00:56:16.96
So, to the north of us, which we knew were going farther north,

484
00:56:16.96 --> 00:56:20.96
there was that big lagoon as a map show.

485
00:56:20.96 --> 00:56:24.96
And so we would have to our eastern flank,

486
00:56:24.96 --> 00:56:26.96
we had the ocean to the western flank.

487
00:56:26.96 --> 00:56:32.96
We had the lagoon, and then to the south, we had the bad guys that we knew of.

488
00:56:32.96 --> 00:56:38.96
And to the north, we had some sand dunes, and we could see,

489
00:56:38.96 --> 00:56:44.96
after you pass this one big bunker, you can see nothing but flat beach.

490
00:56:44.96 --> 00:56:48.96
So, we figured out the arbus objective to move up there.

491
00:56:48.96 --> 00:56:51.96
And Tommy got on top of this, we thought it was a big sand gym,

492
00:56:51.96 --> 00:56:56.96
but actually, it was a bunker built, and actually, it tunnels down inside of it.

493
00:56:56.96 --> 00:56:59.96
And that's the one that you did a recon, and you found that bunker?

494
00:56:59.96 --> 00:57:00.96
Yeah, I found the bunker.

495
00:57:00.96 --> 00:57:01.96
And then you brought Tommy there?

496
00:57:01.96 --> 00:57:04.96
Tommy went up there with the radio, and which was dang,

497
00:57:04.96 --> 00:57:06.96
and that gave us, you know, a course back then,

498
00:57:06.96 --> 00:57:10.96
his radios for PRC 7, 7, and Slon of sight, which you,

499
00:57:10.96 --> 00:57:12.96
yeah.

500
00:57:12.96 --> 00:57:13.96
Yeah.

501
00:57:13.96 --> 00:57:17.96
And he's trying to make comms back to Woody,

502
00:57:17.96 --> 00:57:19.96
and or back to the ship.

503
00:57:19.96 --> 00:57:23.96
Back then, the ship was the new port, and he's in the USS Morgan,

504
00:57:23.96 --> 00:57:26.96
this one, this one, this ship was where then we had,

505
00:57:26.96 --> 00:57:30.96
we finally got Woody, but Woody was down off the mouth of the clock yet.

506
00:57:30.96 --> 00:57:33.96
And he thought, you know, after you got through bearings,

507
00:57:33.96 --> 00:57:36.96
so they were always off from Royale.

508
00:57:36.96 --> 00:57:40.96
So, at this point, you guys are in that bunker,

509
00:57:40.96 --> 00:57:43.96
and Kwon comes from him back, and he says,

510
00:57:43.96 --> 00:57:46.96
die way, nor is with the Starlight scope,

511
00:57:46.96 --> 00:57:48.96
I see two men coming down the beach.

512
00:57:48.96 --> 00:57:51.96
They're quite away off, but they're heading our way.

513
00:57:51.96 --> 00:57:56.96
So, then you seem like you come up with a plan right there,

514
00:57:56.96 --> 00:57:57.96
what you're going to do.

515
00:57:57.96 --> 00:57:58.96
Yeah.

516
00:57:58.96 --> 00:58:01.96
I think, and, well, I'll let you brief what your plan was,

517
00:58:01.96 --> 00:58:03.96
but you see two bad guys coming down the beach,

518
00:58:03.96 --> 00:58:04.96
yeah.

519
00:58:04.96 --> 00:58:07.96
And your idea is cool, it's time to do our body snatch.

520
00:58:07.96 --> 00:58:08.96
That's correct.

521
00:58:08.96 --> 00:58:15.96
And I feared, the officer, which name is mentioned,

522
00:58:15.96 --> 00:58:19.96
he was a good guy, he's like five, nine,

523
00:58:19.96 --> 00:58:22.96
and he was in a strong, I mean, athletic guy.

524
00:58:22.96 --> 00:58:23.96
Right.

525
00:58:23.96 --> 00:58:26.96
So, this is the other Vietnamese officer,

526
00:58:26.96 --> 00:58:28.96
he's a big guy.

527
00:58:28.96 --> 00:58:29.96
Yeah.

528
00:58:29.96 --> 00:58:33.96
So, I put him down on the beach because the high water line,

529
00:58:33.96 --> 00:58:36.96
and these guys were walking up and down the high water line.

530
00:58:36.96 --> 00:58:42.96
And the other guy was about 150 yards ahead of the guy,

531
00:58:42.96 --> 00:58:45.96
cause the other guy was walking up in the sand dunes,

532
00:58:45.96 --> 00:58:48.96
and I figured, we got to make sure we not came out.

533
00:58:48.96 --> 00:58:50.96
But the other guy's just walking by, because he's just

534
00:58:50.96 --> 00:58:56.96
sitting down the coastline, looking around.

535
00:58:56.96 --> 00:59:01.96
And so, I said, I sent Kwon down with the husk puppy,

536
00:59:01.96 --> 00:59:04.96
and not Kwon, but the officer.

537
00:59:04.96 --> 00:59:07.96
And I sent him down, and I said, I'm not,

538
00:59:07.96 --> 00:59:10.96
this guy's got walked by us, but when the other guy,

539
00:59:10.96 --> 00:59:15.96
I'll take him out, and then I had Kwon there with me in Kwon.

540
00:59:15.96 --> 00:59:18.96
After I knocked him out cold, and when Kwon got him,

541
00:59:18.96 --> 00:59:21.96
he went up and secured him.

542
00:59:21.96 --> 00:59:24.96
So, the two guys are walking down the beach,

543
00:59:24.96 --> 00:59:26.96
and a pretty good distance apart.

544
00:59:26.96 --> 00:59:28.96
You say, okay, I'm going to be in Kwon,

545
00:59:28.96 --> 00:59:31.96
we'll go get this guy, we'll capture him.

546
00:59:31.96 --> 00:59:34.96
And then Lieutenant, or the Vietnamese Lieutenant,

547
00:59:34.96 --> 00:59:35.96
you go and get this other guy.

548
00:59:35.96 --> 00:59:36.96
Correct.

549
00:59:36.96 --> 00:59:37.96
And you said, kill him, right?

550
00:59:37.96 --> 00:59:40.96
No, I said, if you could take him, take him down.

551
00:59:40.96 --> 00:59:44.96
But he's right on the shoreline, so the waves are breaking,

552
00:59:44.96 --> 00:59:49.96
this making a lot of turbulence and noise, and the other guys up in the sand,

553
00:59:49.96 --> 00:59:52.96
he said, the high water line, walking around, looking like that.

554
00:59:52.96 --> 00:59:54.96
So, I knew he would be the last one there,

555
00:59:54.96 --> 00:59:57.96
but we had to make sure we took him out for sure.

556
00:59:57.96 --> 00:59:58.96
Right.

557
00:59:58.96 --> 01:00:02.96
And then I told the officer, he could go up and take this guy out,

558
01:00:02.96 --> 01:00:07.96
or eliminate him, or just make sure he didn't go back to the village,

559
01:00:07.96 --> 01:00:11.96
cause the village is on down the beach.

560
01:00:11.96 --> 01:00:15.96
And he stood up, you know, Lyday Malin,

561
01:00:15.96 --> 01:00:17.96
and Vietnamese, I mean, stop, come here.

562
01:00:17.96 --> 01:00:21.96
He's got an AK47, the bad guy does.

563
01:00:21.96 --> 01:00:25.96
He's got a 22 long hush puppy,

564
01:00:25.96 --> 01:00:28.96
which is about from here across this room.

565
01:00:28.96 --> 01:00:31.96
And, you know, he's out there like that,

566
01:00:31.96 --> 01:00:33.96
and the guy opened fire on him.

567
01:00:33.96 --> 01:00:36.96
He's running back towards Tommy and the, and I'm running past him,

568
01:00:36.96 --> 01:00:38.96
because I know he's on the way to the village.

569
01:00:38.96 --> 01:00:41.96
And as I say in the book, you know,

570
01:00:41.96 --> 01:00:44.96
they have radios like everybody did.

571
01:00:44.96 --> 01:00:46.96
So, what sometimes they would,

572
01:00:46.96 --> 01:00:50.96
whether he would send information to shoot

573
01:00:50.96 --> 01:00:53.96
so many rounds in the sky and somebody danced her back,

574
01:00:53.96 --> 01:00:55.96
but they changed all the time.

575
01:00:55.96 --> 01:00:58.96
But at that period of time, he only shot off two rounds.

576
01:00:58.96 --> 01:01:01.96
So, hopefully that didn't mean something better, good.

577
01:01:01.96 --> 01:01:06.96
And we got to the opening of the,

578
01:01:06.96 --> 01:01:10.96
he went across the creek, the creek bed,

579
01:01:10.96 --> 01:01:14.96
and he was heading straight to the entrance to the village.

580
01:01:14.96 --> 01:01:16.96
And I dropped down the one knee,

581
01:01:16.96 --> 01:01:18.96
hit two shots, hit him in the back.

582
01:01:18.96 --> 01:01:20.96
He fell down and next thing, all hell.

583
01:01:20.96 --> 01:01:24.96
It was 50 to 75 bad guys for chasing us down.

584
01:01:24.96 --> 01:01:27.96
And I was heading back to Tommy.

585
01:01:27.96 --> 01:01:30.96
And we got back, and I moved out on the point

586
01:01:30.96 --> 01:01:32.96
as the book explains on what it is.

587
01:01:32.96 --> 01:01:34.96
So, when you, when you grab,

588
01:01:34.96 --> 01:01:37.96
or now you're heading back to Tommy,

589
01:01:37.96 --> 01:01:40.96
and that's in that big sort of bunker doomed.

590
01:01:40.96 --> 01:01:41.96
Yeah, yeah.

591
01:01:41.96 --> 01:01:44.96
And so now all you are collocating the big don't bunker.

592
01:01:44.96 --> 01:01:46.96
No, actually, I'm out on the very point.

593
01:01:46.96 --> 01:01:47.96
Okay.

594
01:01:47.96 --> 01:01:49.96
And Tommy was up on top of the bunker,

595
01:01:49.96 --> 01:01:53.96
and they had taken the guy we did capture up there,

596
01:01:53.96 --> 01:01:55.96
and he was up there.

597
01:01:55.96 --> 01:01:58.96
So, I moved the officer to Ryrs' security

598
01:01:58.96 --> 01:02:01.96
and told him if he sees anything, let Tommy go.

599
01:02:01.96 --> 01:02:05.96
And I put Klan over on my eastern flank,

600
01:02:05.96 --> 01:02:07.96
which is the side of the ocean.

601
01:02:07.96 --> 01:02:09.96
So, I was about 50 feet ahead of him,

602
01:02:09.96 --> 01:02:10.96
50 yards ahead of him.

603
01:02:10.96 --> 01:02:13.96
So, I could cover, I could see everybody coming in.

604
01:02:13.96 --> 01:02:15.96
So, I was kind of like the point.

605
01:02:15.96 --> 01:02:18.96
But I kept Klan over to on the ocean side,

606
01:02:18.96 --> 01:02:20.96
if they tried to flank me.

607
01:02:20.96 --> 01:02:22.96
He would not am off.

608
01:02:22.96 --> 01:02:23.96
Then I could see them.

609
01:02:23.96 --> 01:02:25.96
Look at him over here.

610
01:02:25.96 --> 01:02:26.96
I could see them.

611
01:02:26.96 --> 01:02:29.96
And so, I could see everything out in front of me.

612
01:02:29.96 --> 01:02:32.96
And now the enemy starts coming forward.

613
01:02:32.96 --> 01:02:36.96
And you start engaging them, taking them down.

614
01:02:36.96 --> 01:02:37.96
Yeah, and engaging them.

615
01:02:37.96 --> 01:02:39.96
And what I do, I'd come up over here.

616
01:02:39.96 --> 01:02:41.96
I'd roll over and come up somewhere else.

617
01:02:41.96 --> 01:02:43.96
I'd throw a grenade over here.

618
01:02:43.96 --> 01:02:45.96
I'd move back to another grenade.

619
01:02:45.96 --> 01:02:47.96
I'd move forward.

620
01:02:47.96 --> 01:02:50.96
Where the grenade hit, because I had by that time.

621
01:02:50.96 --> 01:02:53.96
And that gave him a frost priestance

622
01:02:53.96 --> 01:02:55.96
as how many people we had.

623
01:02:55.96 --> 01:02:58.96
They didn't know we had 12 or 15 or...

624
01:02:58.96 --> 01:02:59.96
Well, they didn't.

625
01:02:59.96 --> 01:03:01.96
Tommy and Nim were shooting from up there.

626
01:03:01.96 --> 01:03:04.96
But Tommy was on the radio trying to get communications.

627
01:03:04.96 --> 01:03:09.96
And what Tommy was trying to get communications from and just to kind of lay this out a little bit.

628
01:03:09.96 --> 01:03:12.96
The ships had been told, hey, we might need fire support.

629
01:03:12.96 --> 01:03:13.96
That's correct.

630
01:03:13.96 --> 01:03:17.96
Well, whenever you set up fire support for yourself,

631
01:03:17.96 --> 01:03:21.96
you always set up what we call pre-designated firing position.

632
01:03:21.96 --> 01:03:24.96
So, hey, you know, you name them whatever you're going to name them.

633
01:03:24.96 --> 01:03:25.96
ABCD1234.

634
01:03:25.96 --> 01:03:26.96
Yeah.

635
01:03:26.96 --> 01:03:29.96
It's real easy to jump on the radio and say, hey, fire at position.

636
01:03:29.96 --> 01:03:30.96
Bravo now.

637
01:03:30.96 --> 01:03:34.96
And the, you know, whatever fire support can start hitting that.

638
01:03:34.96 --> 01:03:35.96
That's great.

639
01:03:35.96 --> 01:03:37.96
If you were, you're supposed to be.

640
01:03:37.96 --> 01:03:38.96
And that's the issue.

641
01:03:38.96 --> 01:03:49.96
So, Tommy starts doing this best and saying, hey, fire rounds at this predesignated spot.

642
01:03:49.96 --> 01:03:51.96
They fire rounds at that predesignated spot.

643
01:03:51.96 --> 01:03:53.96
Yes, it could have been seen in it.

644
01:03:53.96 --> 01:03:55.96
So, they started moving north at that preded time.

645
01:03:55.96 --> 01:03:57.96
They were shooting smoke in the air.

646
01:03:57.96 --> 01:04:01.96
And the fire fight went for almost three hours.

647
01:04:01.96 --> 01:04:03.96
Actually, two hours and 55 minutes.

648
01:04:03.96 --> 01:04:06.96
And we had eliminated a lot of these guys.

649
01:04:06.96 --> 01:04:08.96
And they started falling back.

650
01:04:08.96 --> 01:04:13.96
And so, it's five of you that are making like 30, 40, 50 guys fall back.

651
01:04:13.96 --> 01:04:16.96
Well, just four of us, because got it.

652
01:04:16.96 --> 01:04:20.96
The other guy never shot a round of it with sweat.

653
01:04:20.96 --> 01:04:23.96
And that's just, you're taking good fire discipline.

654
01:04:23.96 --> 01:04:25.96
Right.

655
01:04:25.96 --> 01:04:30.96
One or two rounds of time, making good hits, making sure what I do, I shoot in the sand about an inch.

656
01:04:30.96 --> 01:04:32.96
And I'd see their heads come up.

657
01:04:32.96 --> 01:04:35.96
Then I'd shoot about an inch below the sand.

658
01:04:35.96 --> 01:04:37.96
And I get a headshot every time.

659
01:04:37.96 --> 01:04:38.96
So, I could tell that.

660
01:04:38.96 --> 01:04:39.96
And then you roll over.

661
01:04:39.96 --> 01:04:44.96
You know, then with the grenades, you know, and they were getting as you mentioned what

662
01:04:44.96 --> 01:04:47.96
our grenade, of course, we have a four second delay in hours.

663
01:04:47.96 --> 01:04:52.96
And there, there grenades, we had pulled those things.

664
01:04:52.96 --> 01:04:57.96
And they'd go, we'll go and you were from 14 seconds to 28 seconds.

665
01:04:57.96 --> 01:05:03.96
They don't have good quality controlling their grenade factories like we do.

666
01:05:03.96 --> 01:05:05.96
Let's see.

667
01:05:05.96 --> 01:05:07.96
Yeah, you're talking about that.

668
01:05:07.96 --> 01:05:08.96
You're sending guys off.

669
01:05:08.96 --> 01:05:11.96
Now, you're continue to shoot.

670
01:05:11.96 --> 01:05:14.96
You're continuing to hold your position.

671
01:05:14.96 --> 01:05:17.96
You're about halfway through your ammo at this point.

672
01:05:17.96 --> 01:05:21.96
And then speaking of these grenades, you're in one of these positions.

673
01:05:21.96 --> 01:05:25.96
And boom, in comes one of those grenades to your spot.

674
01:05:25.96 --> 01:05:27.96
What should you do about that?

675
01:05:27.96 --> 01:05:29.96
Well, I yelled grenade.

676
01:05:29.96 --> 01:05:31.96
And I grabbed it and threw it back.

677
01:05:31.96 --> 01:05:34.96
I was going 1,000, 2,000, 3,000.

678
01:05:34.96 --> 01:05:37.96
But, I had 8,000, the damn grenade came back over.

679
01:05:37.96 --> 01:05:39.96
And I went 12,000, 13,000, 13,000.

680
01:05:39.96 --> 01:05:41.96
Of course, we were using 1,000.

681
01:05:41.96 --> 01:05:43.96
And I guess you're a good second.

682
01:05:43.96 --> 01:05:46.96
I threw it back.

683
01:05:46.96 --> 01:05:49.96
And the grenade went back and forth five times.

684
01:05:49.96 --> 01:05:52.96
And I was at 21,000, 22,000.

685
01:05:52.96 --> 01:05:54.96
I said this thing's got to go off.

686
01:05:54.96 --> 01:05:55.96
And it went off.

687
01:05:55.96 --> 01:05:57.96
And I was hit six times in my back.

688
01:05:57.96 --> 01:05:58.96
It was wrapped up.

689
01:05:58.96 --> 01:05:59.96
And I just yelled out.

690
01:05:59.96 --> 01:06:01.96
I didn't say nothing else.

691
01:06:01.96 --> 01:06:03.96
And when I yelled out, I just stayed there.

692
01:06:03.96 --> 01:06:04.96
And I looked up.

693
01:06:04.96 --> 01:06:06.96
And there was four guys coming across.

694
01:06:06.96 --> 01:06:08.96
And I eliminated all four of those guys.

695
01:06:08.96 --> 01:06:11.96
And that's when we found out they started falling back.

696
01:06:11.96 --> 01:06:12.96
And Tommy said they're falling back.

697
01:06:12.96 --> 01:06:13.96
And I said, this is it.

698
01:06:13.96 --> 01:06:14.96
Are you OK?

699
01:06:14.96 --> 01:06:17.96
I said, you know, I'm wounded.

700
01:06:17.96 --> 01:06:20.96
OK, I'm still very, very mobile.

701
01:06:20.96 --> 01:06:22.96
And of course, the adrenaline's pumping.

702
01:06:22.96 --> 01:06:24.96
Like God knows what.

703
01:06:24.96 --> 01:06:29.96
And you don't worry about yourself.

704
01:06:29.96 --> 01:06:32.96
You just need, you need to get out of there.

705
01:06:32.96 --> 01:06:34.96
I thought we needed it.

706
01:06:34.96 --> 01:06:39.96
Now, at this point, it seems like they're falling back a little bit.

707
01:06:39.96 --> 01:06:43.96
And it looks like from the way it's described.

708
01:06:43.96 --> 01:06:45.96
There's basically another doon.

709
01:06:45.96 --> 01:06:47.96
And that's a little further back from where you are.

710
01:06:47.96 --> 01:06:49.96
Approximately 500 yards.

711
01:06:49.96 --> 01:06:50.96
And that's to the north.

712
01:06:50.96 --> 01:06:51.96
That's the north.

713
01:06:51.96 --> 01:06:52.96
Right.

714
01:06:52.96 --> 01:06:53.96
Right.

715
01:06:53.96 --> 01:06:54.96
I mean, everything else is flat.

716
01:06:54.96 --> 01:06:55.96
We said for that one, too.

717
01:06:55.96 --> 01:06:58.96
And so what you, what you guys hatch the plan real quick, all right.

718
01:06:58.96 --> 01:06:59.96
Let's get to that thing.

719
01:06:59.96 --> 01:07:00.96
It's further away.

720
01:07:00.96 --> 01:07:01.96
It creates some distance.

721
01:07:01.96 --> 01:07:04.96
And then from there, we can eventually get in the water and get out of here.

722
01:07:04.96 --> 01:07:07.96
And you know, I talk about cover and move all the time.

723
01:07:07.96 --> 01:07:11.96
And that's like the fundamental principle of how we fight.

724
01:07:11.96 --> 01:07:14.96
And in a normal situation, you would just get little

725
01:07:14.96 --> 01:07:18.96
terrain features and you'd move back a little piece at a time because, uh,

726
01:07:18.96 --> 01:07:20.96
Because that's how you support each other.

727
01:07:20.96 --> 01:07:24.96
And this one, there was no where to hide in between those two.

728
01:07:24.96 --> 01:07:25.96
No.

729
01:07:25.96 --> 01:07:29.96
So you guys made the call of Tommy and who's going to stay up there.

730
01:07:29.96 --> 01:07:31.96
Who's Tommy and Dan's a rail,

731
01:07:31.96 --> 01:07:33.96
and the stay up there and Tommy said, you fall back.

732
01:07:33.96 --> 01:07:36.96
Because that period of time, I was the only one in head in the end.

733
01:07:36.96 --> 01:07:37.96
I've been wounded.

734
01:07:37.96 --> 01:07:40.96
But what we did, I looked across that apartment,

735
01:07:40.96 --> 01:07:44.96
and I said, I could understand why because I counted almost 100 guys.

736
01:07:44.96 --> 01:07:46.96
And Tommy said, there's a lot more in that.

737
01:07:46.96 --> 01:07:48.96
And it was a NVA batay.

738
01:07:48.96 --> 01:07:51.96
And they were trying to encircle us.

739
01:07:51.96 --> 01:07:54.96
And by the time I got back,

740
01:07:54.96 --> 01:07:58.96
as the book says,

741
01:07:58.96 --> 01:07:59.96
Dan comes back by himself.

742
01:07:59.96 --> 01:08:02.96
Because Tommy had been shot in the head at that period of time.

743
01:08:02.96 --> 01:08:05.96
So, so you guys, they put down cover,

744
01:08:05.96 --> 01:08:07.96
they put down cover fire for you.

745
01:08:07.96 --> 01:08:11.96
And then you fall back, you're doing what you're supposed to do.

746
01:08:11.96 --> 01:08:13.96
And you got the Vietnamese lieutenant,

747
01:08:13.96 --> 01:08:15.96
and you got Kwon with you.

748
01:08:15.96 --> 01:08:17.96
You get back to that position.

749
01:08:17.96 --> 01:08:25.96
And that means Lieutenant Norris is still up in the big bunker.

750
01:08:25.96 --> 01:08:26.96
Get ready.

751
01:08:26.96 --> 01:08:28.96
He's waiting for your fire support.

752
01:08:28.96 --> 01:08:30.96
And while that's happening,

753
01:08:30.96 --> 01:08:33.96
I'm going to go to the book right here.

754
01:08:33.96 --> 01:08:36.96
I was asking for Naval Gunfire.

755
01:08:36.96 --> 01:08:39.96
Right on to our position.

756
01:08:39.96 --> 01:08:41.96
And he says, those rounds could hit dang.

757
01:08:41.96 --> 01:08:43.96
And me, just as well as the bad guys,

758
01:08:43.96 --> 01:08:44.96
but I had no choice.

759
01:08:44.96 --> 01:08:47.96
The guy on the radio came back and said,

760
01:08:47.96 --> 01:08:49.96
understand fire for effect.

761
01:08:49.96 --> 01:08:51.96
And I said, absolutely put it on us.

762
01:08:51.96 --> 01:08:53.96
And he said, are you sure?

763
01:08:53.96 --> 01:08:56.96
And I said, just get it in here.

764
01:08:56.96 --> 01:08:59.96
And so they had actually,

765
01:08:59.96 --> 01:09:02.96
as they were calling in this Naval Gunfire,

766
01:09:02.96 --> 01:09:04.96
Tommy was like, seeing guys coming

767
01:09:04.96 --> 01:09:06.96
and like through the grace of God,

768
01:09:06.96 --> 01:09:08.96
a one big round hit there.

769
01:09:08.96 --> 01:09:09.96
They hit them.

770
01:09:09.96 --> 01:09:12.96
And got a lot of bad guys.

771
01:09:12.96 --> 01:09:16.96
And then again, going back to the book,

772
01:09:16.96 --> 01:09:18.96
I went back to getting the law ready to fire.

773
01:09:18.96 --> 01:09:20.96
That's a law rocket.

774
01:09:20.96 --> 01:09:22.96
I could hear the ship shooting.

775
01:09:22.96 --> 01:09:24.96
But that's the last thing I remember.

776
01:09:24.96 --> 01:09:26.96
And then the narrator comes in and says,

777
01:09:26.96 --> 01:09:30.96
at that point in the fight, Tom Norris took an AK-47

778
01:09:30.96 --> 01:09:32.96
round to the left side of his forehead.

779
01:09:32.96 --> 01:09:35.96
The bullet entered his skull at the orbital socket

780
01:09:35.96 --> 01:09:39.96
of his left eye, tore a section of his skull,

781
01:09:39.96 --> 01:09:43.96
exposing his brain and cut a shallow furl along the brain itself.

782
01:09:43.96 --> 01:09:46.96
Dang saw his officer go down

783
01:09:46.96 --> 01:09:48.96
and the extent of his head wound.

784
01:09:48.96 --> 01:09:51.96
His lieutenant had been shot dead.

785
01:09:51.96 --> 01:09:53.96
Knowing there was nothing he could do.

786
01:09:53.96 --> 01:09:56.96
He made for the others who had just taken a position

787
01:09:56.96 --> 01:09:59.96
on the next dune to the north.

788
01:09:59.96 --> 01:10:01.96
As he ran, he took around through the radio.

789
01:10:01.96 --> 01:10:04.96
He still carried on his back knocking him down.

790
01:10:04.96 --> 01:10:07.96
The round destroyed the radio and saved his life,

791
01:10:07.96 --> 01:10:09.96
but fragments carried through into his back.

792
01:10:09.96 --> 01:10:12.96
Dang picked himself up and kept running.

793
01:10:12.96 --> 01:10:15.96
It took him close to ten minutes to reach Mike.

794
01:10:15.96 --> 01:10:17.96
Where's Tommy?

795
01:10:17.96 --> 01:10:19.96
Mike asked Dang when he reached him.

796
01:10:19.96 --> 01:10:21.96
Where is Daiway?

797
01:10:21.96 --> 01:10:23.96
Daiway is dead.

798
01:10:23.96 --> 01:10:24.96
Dang replied.

799
01:10:24.96 --> 01:10:28.96
And this is it.

800
01:10:28.96 --> 01:10:35.96
So you know, you're trusted via an amuse fellow seal.

801
01:10:35.96 --> 01:10:37.96
Says, hey, look, the lieutenant.

802
01:10:37.96 --> 01:10:38.96
That's Daiway.

803
01:10:38.96 --> 01:10:41.96
He's dead.

804
01:10:41.96 --> 01:10:43.96
And this is what you do.

805
01:10:43.96 --> 01:10:44.96
I'm going to the book here.

806
01:10:44.96 --> 01:10:46.96
I told Kwon and the others to wait here

807
01:10:46.96 --> 01:10:49.96
that I was going back for Tommy.

808
01:10:49.96 --> 01:10:52.96
They tried to stop me saying it was no use.

809
01:10:52.96 --> 01:10:54.96
He was dead.

810
01:10:54.96 --> 01:10:56.96
I believe them.

811
01:10:56.96 --> 01:11:00.96
I too thought he was dead, but I wasn't going to leave him behind.

812
01:11:00.96 --> 01:11:02.96
We never leave anybody behind.

813
01:11:02.96 --> 01:11:06.96
So no way was I going to be the first to do that.

814
01:11:06.96 --> 01:11:10.96
Had I been wounded or dead, he'd have come back for me.

815
01:11:10.96 --> 01:11:12.96
That's who we are.

816
01:11:12.96 --> 01:11:15.96
Dang said he was dead and I had no reason not to believe him.

817
01:11:15.96 --> 01:11:17.96
It didn't matter.

818
01:11:17.96 --> 01:11:22.96
And what if by chance he was still alive.

819
01:11:22.96 --> 01:11:24.96
I could not have lived with myself.

820
01:11:24.96 --> 01:11:28.96
If I had left him behind not knowing, or what the NVA might do to him

821
01:11:28.96 --> 01:11:31.96
if he were still alive.

822
01:11:31.96 --> 01:11:34.96
That whole area south of the bunker was littered with bodies

823
01:11:34.96 --> 01:11:38.96
and they would be looking for revenge.

824
01:11:38.96 --> 01:11:41.96
I had close to a quarter of a mile to cover

825
01:11:41.96 --> 01:11:45.96
and the last part was uphill, but I ran all the way.

826
01:11:45.96 --> 01:11:49.96
The initial salvo from the Morton that was the ship out at sea

827
01:11:49.96 --> 01:11:52.96
although I didn't know it at the time that it was the Morton shooting

828
01:11:52.96 --> 01:11:56.96
had made the bad guys think twice about advancing on the dune

829
01:11:56.96 --> 01:11:57.96
with the bunker.

830
01:11:57.96 --> 01:12:01.96
When I got close, I saw the moving carefully towards the bunker

831
01:12:01.96 --> 01:12:04.96
from where I could see they were flanking the bunker

832
01:12:04.96 --> 01:12:09.96
and moving in from the east or the beachside as well as from the south.

833
01:12:09.96 --> 01:12:12.96
I saw Tommy lying on the west side of the bunker.

834
01:12:12.96 --> 01:12:16.96
Two guys were climbing over the top as they moved in from the east.

835
01:12:16.96 --> 01:12:19.96
They moved cautiously and got within a few feet of him.

836
01:12:19.96 --> 01:12:22.96
I shot them both and moved to where Tommy was.

837
01:12:22.96 --> 01:12:25.96
He had an unbelievable head wound.

838
01:12:25.96 --> 01:12:27.96
The whole side of his forehead was gone.

839
01:12:27.96 --> 01:12:29.96
His brain was visible.

840
01:12:29.96 --> 01:12:31.96
You could actually see it.

841
01:12:31.96 --> 01:12:35.96
The front lobe of his brain was kind of pushing out through his skull.

842
01:12:35.96 --> 01:12:38.96
I could see why dang said he was dead.

843
01:12:38.96 --> 01:12:40.96
I sure thought he was.

844
01:12:40.96 --> 01:12:45.96
I picked him up, put him over my shoulder, and started running.

845
01:12:45.96 --> 01:12:50.96
I also grabbed his AK-47 as I knew I was getting low on ammo.

846
01:12:50.96 --> 01:12:55.96
I hadn't taken more than ten steps from the bunker when there was this explosion behind me

847
01:12:55.96 --> 01:12:57.96
from Naval Gunfire round.

848
01:12:57.96 --> 01:13:01.96
The concussion picked us both up in the air, lifting Tommy off my shoulder

849
01:13:01.96 --> 01:13:05.96
and tossed us forward, ten or fifteen feet.

850
01:13:05.96 --> 01:13:10.96
I literally saw him move my shoulder, leave my shoulder, and fly through the air.

851
01:13:10.96 --> 01:13:13.96
When I landed, I sat there for a moment stunned,

852
01:13:13.96 --> 01:13:16.96
trying to orient myself and catch my breath.

853
01:13:16.96 --> 01:13:22.96
Once I started myself out, I crawled over to where Tommy was lying in the sand.

854
01:13:22.96 --> 01:13:26.96
Once I got to Tommy again and started to pick him up,

855
01:13:26.96 --> 01:13:28.96
he spoke to me for the first time.

856
01:13:28.96 --> 01:13:31.96
He said, Mike, buddy.

857
01:13:31.96 --> 01:13:33.96
And that was when I knew he was alive.

858
01:13:33.96 --> 01:13:35.96
I said, can you run?

859
01:13:35.96 --> 01:13:38.96
And he says, I can run, but I can't see.

860
01:13:38.96 --> 01:13:41.96
But he really couldn't run.

861
01:13:41.96 --> 01:13:43.96
Then he blanked out again.

862
01:13:43.96 --> 01:13:48.96
I put him in a fireman's carry and took off for the dune to the north where I left the others.

863
01:13:48.96 --> 01:13:53.96
I heard him talking now and then, and I guess he was fading in and out.

864
01:13:53.96 --> 01:13:56.96
But I knew he was alive.

865
01:13:56.96 --> 01:14:04.96
And I put all my energy and focused to covering the ground between where we were and the other dune.

866
01:14:04.96 --> 01:14:22.96
We were like I said, you know, and I've talked about the camaraderie in the respect we have for each other.

867
01:14:22.96 --> 01:14:28.96
And even though Tommy's a much smaller than I am, he would have done the same thing for me.

868
01:14:28.96 --> 01:14:33.10
I know that so it's like you say you,

869
01:14:35.44 --> 01:14:36.72
you know, if you die,

870
01:14:37.84 --> 01:14:41.68
which we're all, we understand what our job is,

871
01:14:41.68 --> 01:14:46.08
that being Navy sales, but I can never live with myself,

872
01:14:46.08 --> 01:14:47.72
no one that fused that.

873
01:14:47.72 --> 01:14:51.40
I thought he was dead, but the grace of God

874
01:14:51.40 --> 01:15:02.40
we still with us. So as I was running back with him,

875
01:15:02.40 --> 01:15:04.40
I got shot to my left calf,

876
01:15:04.40 --> 01:15:10.08
and to my left calf, and I fell to the ground,

877
01:15:10.08 --> 01:15:12.64
and we got back in there, it's quannandone,

878
01:15:12.64 --> 01:15:14.52
given us cover fire.

879
01:15:14.52 --> 01:15:19.84
Were you, like when I've done stuff that was maybe

880
01:15:19.84 --> 01:15:22.76
not the safest things in the world,

881
01:15:22.76 --> 01:15:25.12
I never was really thinking like,

882
01:15:25.12 --> 01:15:26.80
oh, this is dangerous.

883
01:15:27.80 --> 01:15:31.68
Were you thinking, oh, this is really dangerous?

884
01:15:31.68 --> 01:15:34.92
Oh, he's over there, and I gotta go get him,

885
01:15:34.92 --> 01:15:35.84
because that's what we do.

886
01:15:35.84 --> 01:15:36.88
Yeah, that's what we do.

887
01:15:36.88 --> 01:15:37.88
So that's what it is.

888
01:15:37.88 --> 01:15:40.48
You don't, you know, fears a good thing,

889
01:15:40.48 --> 01:15:41.60
but you gotta focus.

890
01:15:41.60 --> 01:15:44.56
I mean, if, you know, I could have said dinner today,

891
01:15:44.56 --> 01:15:47.40
we were all go die, I'm just a lie here and do it.

892
01:15:47.40 --> 01:15:51.44
But I said, I'm taking as many of those SOBs down as I can.

893
01:15:51.44 --> 01:15:54.64
And, you know, and the thing is, is that,

894
01:15:58.64 --> 01:16:01.04
it's like we go back to what we are,

895
01:16:01.04 --> 01:16:03.52
and the camaraderie, and going through training,

896
01:16:03.52 --> 01:16:06.44
and why we do things, and you're thanks like that.

897
01:16:06.44 --> 01:16:08.64
I think that the broader was my father.

898
01:16:08.64 --> 01:16:10.44
And as I go back to, I look about it,

899
01:16:10.44 --> 01:16:12.52
because my dad never would've left me behind,

900
01:16:12.52 --> 01:16:14.68
or anybody else behind, you know,

901
01:16:14.68 --> 01:16:17.36
that's what's instilled in us as we go through training.

902
01:16:17.36 --> 01:16:19.96
And as was instilled us, you know,

903
01:16:19.96 --> 01:16:22.88
Tom Boyhand was saying last night,

904
01:16:22.88 --> 01:16:24.44
you said, you know, I don't think you're in New York,

905
01:16:24.44 --> 01:16:25.28
fear was.

906
01:16:25.28 --> 01:16:28.52
Well, I knew what it was, but I mean, being afraid,

907
01:16:28.52 --> 01:16:32.36
you know, if you were about being afraid of everything,

908
01:16:32.36 --> 01:16:33.64
you should never be in the field,

909
01:16:33.64 --> 01:16:36.000
because you're not focused on what you're trying to do.

910
01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.72
So that's the whole thing is, you know,

911
01:16:38.72 --> 01:16:40.24
so we're out there to do a job,

912
01:16:40.24 --> 01:16:42.16
so let's get the damn job done.

913
01:16:42.16 --> 01:16:43.60
Yeah, it's interesting to me,

914
01:16:43.60 --> 01:16:47.20
that I would, I think guys would feel more afraid

915
01:16:47.20 --> 01:16:51.36
when we were getting ready to go in the field,

916
01:16:51.36 --> 01:16:54.16
when even me, you know, when you have time to think,

917
01:16:54.16 --> 01:16:55.48
like, oh, we're going down the street,

918
01:16:55.48 --> 01:16:59.80
which is had, you know, 17 ID's on in the last four days.

919
01:16:59.80 --> 01:17:03.000
And there's guaranteed to be another one on there tonight,

920
01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:04.40
with a question, is it gonna hit you

921
01:17:04.40 --> 01:17:06.28
or is it gonna hit someone else?

922
01:17:06.28 --> 01:17:09.80
And that's, I would see the look on guys faces

923
01:17:09.80 --> 01:17:12.36
while we were getting ready to go out,

924
01:17:12.36 --> 01:17:14.32
and you could see a little bit of that.

925
01:17:14.32 --> 01:17:15.92
But once you're in the field,

926
01:17:15.92 --> 01:17:17.32
everyone's doing what they do.

927
01:17:17.32 --> 01:17:18.44
They're just doing their job.

928
01:17:18.44 --> 01:17:20.32
And it's like flickin' the switch, you know,

929
01:17:20.32 --> 01:17:23.12
why switch, you get your mind,

930
01:17:23.12 --> 01:17:24.96
and know what your supposed to be doin'.

931
01:17:24.96 --> 01:17:28.88
So, if a guy's, does have his mind in the game,

932
01:17:28.88 --> 01:17:29.76
he's gonna stay at home,

933
01:17:29.76 --> 01:17:31.48
he ain't goin' out in the field with my thorn

934
01:17:31.48 --> 01:17:32.60
or problems with that.

935
01:17:33.76 --> 01:17:37.36
Now, this is one of my favorite parts of the book,

936
01:17:38.36 --> 01:17:41.48
that is, well, I'll read it.

937
01:17:41.48 --> 01:17:42.84
When I got, this is you talkin',

938
01:17:42.84 --> 01:17:44.56
when I got back to the dune,

939
01:17:44.56 --> 01:17:48.000
dang and quan were waiting for me, providing cover fire.

940
01:17:49.20 --> 01:17:51.48
Lieutenant Plon was nowhere in sight,

941
01:17:51.48 --> 01:17:54.52
he'd already made it for the water to escape.

942
01:17:54.52 --> 01:17:56.52
But God bless dang and quan,

943
01:17:56.52 --> 01:17:59.08
they waited for me and were still in the fight,

944
01:17:59.08 --> 01:18:00.52
even though dang was wounded.

945
01:18:01.44 --> 01:18:04.80
They said, Mike, what do we do now?

946
01:18:05.80 --> 01:18:08.24
And I said, we swim.

947
01:18:08.24 --> 01:18:13.24
We swim, which is the classic seal scenario

948
01:18:14.08 --> 01:18:17.80
in that the water is our salvation.

949
01:18:17.80 --> 01:18:21.76
You know, it's like, we have that special experience

950
01:18:21.76 --> 01:18:25.76
in the water and people don't come from underwater

951
01:18:25.76 --> 01:18:27.16
and it's our home.

952
01:18:27.16 --> 01:18:29.72
And that was just the classic answer to these guys

953
01:18:29.72 --> 01:18:31.04
who said, what do we do now?

954
01:18:31.04 --> 01:18:32.60
Remember, we're combat swimmers,

955
01:18:32.60 --> 01:18:35.28
like I'm bat runners, but the running does help.

956
01:18:35.28 --> 01:18:40.28
Okay. So, now talk about when you're getting,

957
01:18:42.88 --> 01:18:44.12
now you're moving to the water.

958
01:18:44.12 --> 01:18:46.56
You're carrying a Tommy, what goes on then?

959
01:18:46.56 --> 01:18:51.68
Well, I didn't inflate Tommy's life jacket

960
01:18:51.68 --> 01:18:53.04
as some of the stories said.

961
01:18:53.04 --> 01:18:56.24
I, I was using Tommy like a surfboard

962
01:18:56.24 --> 01:18:57.80
and every time a wave would break,

963
01:18:57.80 --> 01:19:00.36
I'd push him under the water and bring him up the other side

964
01:19:00.36 --> 01:19:03.04
because the worst thing you could do is have a wave

965
01:19:03.04 --> 01:19:05.44
and we had six sets of waves coming in

966
01:19:05.44 --> 01:19:08.08
and that's how quan ended up getting injured.

967
01:19:08.08 --> 01:19:09.48
You guys shot.

968
01:19:09.48 --> 01:19:13.20
And so I, after I got Tommy out, that's when I put,

969
01:19:14.20 --> 01:19:16.76
and I could never find Tommy's life jacket.

970
01:19:16.76 --> 01:19:19.92
And he had it and I pocketed down on his cap

971
01:19:19.92 --> 01:19:20.76
and I said, why?

972
01:19:20.76 --> 01:19:22.96
So I wonder if I get a bullet hole in it.

973
01:19:22.96 --> 01:19:26.08
I said, it's good because we put a piece of tape

974
01:19:26.08 --> 01:19:29.20
and if you have a, you know, second chest wound,

975
01:19:29.20 --> 01:19:32.60
I can take, so I took my life jacket off me

976
01:19:32.60 --> 01:19:35.24
and put it on his head and I took the, you know,

977
01:19:35.24 --> 01:19:37.28
the old UDT, I took the harness.

978
01:19:37.28 --> 01:19:38.76
But I just put a little bit of air

979
01:19:38.76 --> 01:19:42.04
and I started breast-strokeing out to see.

980
01:19:42.04 --> 01:19:45.44
And that's when I saw quan was not going anywhere.

981
01:19:45.44 --> 01:19:48.28
And I could see dang out in front of me.

982
01:19:48.28 --> 01:19:53.28
And so I swam over in grab quan and I put quan in front of me.

983
01:19:53.28 --> 01:19:54.28
A quan had been shot too.

984
01:19:54.28 --> 01:19:55.56
It had been shot pretty bad.

985
01:19:55.56 --> 01:19:58.92
Yeah, and the back femur and also his butt

986
01:19:58.92 --> 01:20:00.60
actually was completely kind of gone.

987
01:20:00.60 --> 01:20:03.88
He's like, good. So I, so you're wounded.

988
01:20:03.88 --> 01:20:05.44
You got shrapnel in your back.

989
01:20:05.44 --> 01:20:06.44
You got shot in the leg.

990
01:20:06.44 --> 01:20:10.84
Like you got Lieutenant Norris who's basically unconscious,

991
01:20:10.84 --> 01:20:11.52
dying.

992
01:20:11.52 --> 01:20:12.84
Yeah.

993
01:20:12.84 --> 01:20:15.36
And now you got quan who he can't move himself.

994
01:20:15.36 --> 01:20:16.52
He's immobile as well.

995
01:20:16.52 --> 01:20:17.68
Great.

996
01:20:17.68 --> 01:20:20.44
And dang is leading point as you guys are patting out

997
01:20:20.44 --> 01:20:22.92
and you're carrying both these other guys through the water.

998
01:20:22.92 --> 01:20:26.80
So what I did, I took quan and put his arm,

999
01:20:26.80 --> 01:20:28.76
I put my arms underneath quans, arms,

1000
01:20:28.76 --> 01:20:32.12
and he held Tommy like this and I started breaststroke.

1001
01:20:32.12 --> 01:20:36.40
And two, we got out past the range of their weapons.

1002
01:20:36.40 --> 01:20:39.68
And at that period of time, I inflated quans,

1003
01:20:39.68 --> 01:20:41.68
life check with a little bit, then I actually

1004
01:20:41.68 --> 01:20:43.68
tied his life jacket to my waist.

1005
01:20:43.68 --> 01:20:46.32
And I towed quan and swam with Tommy on my back.

1006
01:20:50.80 --> 01:20:54.60
Here's, again, a typical, I think this exemplifies

1007
01:20:54.60 --> 01:20:57.68
that seal attitude right here.

1008
01:20:57.68 --> 01:21:01.24
This is, you talking every time Tommy woke up,

1009
01:21:01.24 --> 01:21:02.36
it was Mike.

1010
01:21:02.36 --> 01:21:03.68
You got everyone.

1011
01:21:03.68 --> 01:21:04.88
I could only count four of us,

1012
01:21:04.88 --> 01:21:06.52
where's the other guy?

1013
01:21:06.52 --> 01:21:08.36
I'd say I got them, I got everyone.

1014
01:21:08.36 --> 01:21:10.24
And then he drift off again.

1015
01:21:10.24 --> 01:21:12.32
Then when he woke up again, it was Mike.

1016
01:21:12.32 --> 01:21:13.32
You got everyone.

1017
01:21:13.32 --> 01:21:14.56
Do you have all of them?

1018
01:21:15.68 --> 01:21:17.60
And I'd say damn it, Tommy, I got them all.

1019
01:21:17.60 --> 01:21:19.36
Okay, they're accounted for.

1020
01:21:19.36 --> 01:21:22.32
But I just love the fact that, you know,

1021
01:21:22.32 --> 01:21:25.56
you got a guy that's clearly close to death.

1022
01:21:25.56 --> 01:21:30.12
And when he does become conscious, his number one concern

1023
01:21:30.12 --> 01:21:31.72
is does he have his guys with him?

1024
01:21:31.72 --> 01:21:33.000
His troops, that's it.

1025
01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.80
And that's the way great leadership is.

1026
01:21:35.80 --> 01:21:39.000
Sometimes people surpass that because, you know,

1027
01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:42.44
but it goes back to the thing that you and I were talking

1028
01:21:42.44 --> 01:21:44.20
about earlier, you take care of your people,

1029
01:21:44.20 --> 01:21:45.96
your people will take care of you.

1030
01:21:47.64 --> 01:21:51.80
Now, you get out, you know, past like you said,

1031
01:21:51.80 --> 01:21:53.88
past the small arms fire.

1032
01:21:53.88 --> 01:21:58.04
And again, dang and quann, keep asking, Mike,

1033
01:21:58.04 --> 01:21:58.84
what do we do?

1034
01:21:58.84 --> 01:21:59.68
What do we do?

1035
01:21:59.68 --> 01:22:04.40
And each time you said, we swim, we just keep swimming.

1036
01:22:04.40 --> 01:22:08.40
We'll swim south all the way to two we non if we have to.

1037
01:22:11.44 --> 01:22:12.12
That's correct.

1038
01:22:12.12 --> 01:22:13.28
And that's what you did.

1039
01:22:13.28 --> 01:22:16.36
You start you kept swimming and kept swimming

1040
01:22:16.36 --> 01:22:20.32
and kept swimming and you're out there for three hours,

1041
01:22:20.32 --> 01:22:21.16
swimming.

1042
01:22:21.16 --> 01:22:23.32
And just to put that into some perspective

1043
01:22:23.32 --> 01:22:27.56
for people that have never swim in the open ocean before,

1044
01:22:27.56 --> 01:22:30.04
the longest swim that you do in seal training

1045
01:22:30.04 --> 01:22:35.04
is 5.5 nautical miles, which is 6.2 statute,

1046
01:22:37.24 --> 01:22:38.88
regular land miles.

1047
01:22:38.88 --> 01:22:40.68
And that takes depending on the current,

1048
01:22:40.68 --> 01:22:42.76
depending on how good of your swim or you are.

1049
01:22:42.76 --> 01:22:45.48
That's the longest swim that they actually make you do.

1050
01:22:45.48 --> 01:22:48.72
And that takes like three, four, sometimes five hours.

1051
01:22:48.72 --> 01:22:51.12
That's the longest swim that they make you do.

1052
01:22:51.12 --> 01:22:54.68
And by the way, they give you a little water break in between.

1053
01:22:54.68 --> 01:22:59.16
So here you are swimming this

1054
01:22:59.16 --> 01:23:01.000
and you're wounded, shot in the leg.

1055
01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:02.68
Like I said, you're dragging these other guys.

1056
01:23:02.68 --> 01:23:07.64
Now luckily Bill Woodruff and we talked about this earlier,

1057
01:23:07.64 --> 01:23:08.48
you had.

1058
01:23:08.48 --> 01:23:09.32
He saved our life.

1059
01:23:09.32 --> 01:23:10.96
I mean, Billy wouldn't give up almost.

1060
01:23:10.96 --> 01:23:12.12
He would not give up.

1061
01:23:12.12 --> 01:23:14.60
He kept looking for us and they,

1062
01:23:14.60 --> 01:23:16.92
and actually the Morgan thought they had killed us all.

1063
01:23:16.92 --> 01:23:20.60
They thought they'd never knew until several years ago

1064
01:23:20.60 --> 01:23:21.96
that we were still alive.

1065
01:23:21.96 --> 01:23:24.96
No, that's actually a great, and again, obviously,

1066
01:23:24.96 --> 01:23:28.16
I can't cover the whole book on this show,

1067
01:23:28.16 --> 01:23:33.000
but get the book because there's Dick Coward's

1068
01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:34.80
did a great job of actually going out

1069
01:23:34.80 --> 01:23:37.92
and talking to the people that were firing,

1070
01:23:37.92 --> 01:23:39.36
talking to people on the Morgan.

1071
01:23:39.36 --> 01:23:42.12
And you're right, they fired rounds and all of a sudden

1072
01:23:42.12 --> 01:23:43.28
they didn't hear anything.

1073
01:23:43.28 --> 01:23:45.56
And they fired danger, close rounds,

1074
01:23:45.56 --> 01:23:47.80
meaning like rounds that we know are going to be very close

1075
01:23:47.80 --> 01:23:49.16
to our friendly forces.

1076
01:23:49.16 --> 01:23:51.40
And then they never heard another word.

1077
01:23:51.40 --> 01:23:54.44
So their thought was horrible.

1078
01:23:54.44 --> 01:23:56.68
We must have hit our own guys.

1079
01:23:56.68 --> 01:23:59.76
And but luckily, and the other thing that's interesting

1080
01:23:59.76 --> 01:24:04.92
about Bill Woodruff is the other Lieutenant,

1081
01:24:04.92 --> 01:24:07.68
the Vietnamese Lieutenant had actually gotten out to them

1082
01:24:07.68 --> 01:24:09.92
and told him, hey, this is what happened.

1083
01:24:09.92 --> 01:24:11.56
The Lieutenant got killed.

1084
01:24:11.56 --> 01:24:15.24
Mike went to go get him and never came back.

1085
01:24:15.24 --> 01:24:16.16
That's what he got told.

1086
01:24:16.16 --> 01:24:17.84
So the word got back to Woody

1087
01:24:17.84 --> 01:24:20.44
and he called the Newport News and they went out with the Navy

1088
01:24:20.44 --> 01:24:21.40
Blue.

1089
01:24:21.40 --> 01:24:22.80
The Tommy was dead.

1090
01:24:22.80 --> 01:24:24.32
I was missing in action.

1091
01:24:24.32 --> 01:24:27.08
And they were still looking for a quannand egg.

1092
01:24:27.08 --> 01:24:27.92
So.

1093
01:24:33.24 --> 01:24:34.08
OK.

1094
01:24:34.08 --> 01:24:35.20
So here's actually here.

1095
01:24:35.20 --> 01:24:36.28
We're here in the book.

1096
01:24:36.28 --> 01:24:37.84
And again, Dick Coward's did a great job

1097
01:24:37.84 --> 01:24:41.12
getting back with all the guys that were there,

1098
01:24:41.12 --> 01:24:42.40
or at least a lot of them.

1099
01:24:42.40 --> 01:24:46.76
And he's talking to Woody here, Bill Woodruff.

1100
01:24:46.76 --> 01:24:50.48
He says it was about 1130, and I saw the Newport News

1101
01:24:50.48 --> 01:24:53.48
begin to move off to the south.

1102
01:24:53.48 --> 01:24:56.84
Then my junk skipper got a call from the other junk

1103
01:24:56.84 --> 01:24:59.96
that was off to the north and slightly insure from us.

1104
01:24:59.96 --> 01:25:02.04
We were about a half mile apart.

1105
01:25:02.04 --> 01:25:05.92
So as to better search the area, they said they had swimmers

1106
01:25:05.92 --> 01:25:09.28
in the water and we're going to get them.

1107
01:25:09.28 --> 01:25:12.56
You can't know what that meant.

1108
01:25:12.56 --> 01:25:14.72
So there it is.

1109
01:25:14.72 --> 01:25:17.32
Because Bill stuck around.

1110
01:25:17.32 --> 01:25:23.000
And I have the greatest admiration and respect for Bill.

1111
01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:24.88
I'm glad that Bill found us.

1112
01:25:24.88 --> 01:25:26.84
Those bills could do a counterattack.

1113
01:25:26.84 --> 01:25:30.84
And then we had Ryan McCombie down in Tuanon getting a bunch

1114
01:25:30.84 --> 01:25:31.24
of guy.

1115
01:25:31.24 --> 01:25:33.56
Everybody else, it was left to come and find us.

1116
01:25:33.56 --> 01:25:38.04
So that goes back to the things about taking care of your team

1117
01:25:38.04 --> 01:25:44.40
and they did find us because none of those guys

1118
01:25:44.40 --> 01:25:47.60
were made because I mean they had over 600 bad guys up there.

1119
01:25:47.60 --> 01:25:52.52
So sometimes you don't want to leave nobody behind.

1120
01:25:52.52 --> 01:25:55.80
Sometimes you got to take care of losses too.

1121
01:25:55.80 --> 01:25:58.40
It was the two things.

1122
01:25:58.40 --> 01:26:01.48
And I've heard this from other seals and Vietnam.

1123
01:26:01.48 --> 01:26:02.48
Two missions.

1124
01:26:02.48 --> 01:26:04.24
There's no question we're launching on.

1125
01:26:04.24 --> 01:26:06.36
It's down pilot and seals and trouble.

1126
01:26:06.36 --> 01:26:07.04
We're going.

1127
01:26:07.04 --> 01:26:08.36
Yep.

1128
01:26:08.36 --> 01:26:10.96
And that's what those guys that were still in Tuanon were doing.

1129
01:26:10.96 --> 01:26:11.92
They were getting ready to come.

1130
01:26:11.92 --> 01:26:12.72
They're going to come.

1131
01:26:12.72 --> 01:26:13.80
They're coming after us.

1132
01:26:13.80 --> 01:26:20.28
And I think we'd lost everybody trying to get in to get us at the top.

1133
01:26:20.28 --> 01:26:21.64
Because like I said, they had the gun in place.

1134
01:26:21.64 --> 01:26:23.20
And they had tanks in there.

1135
01:26:23.20 --> 01:26:25.84
We weren't the heavy duty guys.

1136
01:26:25.84 --> 01:26:31.80
But that goes back to even what we have today with Eric Krichs

1137
01:26:31.80 --> 01:26:35.84
and trying to go in and losing the guys.

1138
01:26:35.84 --> 01:26:39.16
We're going to go in and get our boys back out.

1139
01:26:39.16 --> 01:26:46.16
And we passed a baton on back from where I am.

1140
01:26:46.16 --> 01:26:48.72
And he's young men who service now.

1141
01:26:48.72 --> 01:26:50.56
I have the greatest admiration.

1142
01:26:50.56 --> 01:26:54.16
There are a lot smarter than I am, because I mean,

1143
01:26:54.16 --> 01:26:56.36
he's going through training now.

1144
01:26:56.36 --> 01:26:57.80
They're all going to college education.

1145
01:26:57.80 --> 01:26:58.80
But they're in list of guys.

1146
01:26:58.80 --> 01:27:00.28
They just have to be in the teams.

1147
01:27:00.28 --> 01:27:01.84
And the training they do is awesome.

1148
01:27:01.84 --> 01:27:02.84
Oh, yes.

1149
01:27:02.84 --> 01:27:05.84
And way better than I had it when I went through it.

1150
01:27:05.84 --> 01:27:12.60
And they're at very high standards, great guys coming through.

1151
01:27:12.60 --> 01:27:14.12
So you guys now get back on board.

1152
01:27:14.12 --> 01:27:18.52
But obviously this didn't vote over yet because you got severely wounded, especially Tommy

1153
01:27:18.52 --> 01:27:19.52
Norris.

1154
01:27:19.52 --> 01:27:22.08
And you actually told them, bring the new port news back because there's a...

1155
01:27:22.08 --> 01:27:23.08
Correct.

1156
01:27:23.08 --> 01:27:24.08
There's a doctor.

1157
01:27:24.08 --> 01:27:26.72
I knew there was a doctor on board because it was a Navy cruiser.

1158
01:27:26.72 --> 01:27:28.96
And they had a Lieutenant Commander on board.

1159
01:27:28.96 --> 01:27:35.64
And I called Woody and I said, we have 4WIA in one critical.

1160
01:27:35.64 --> 01:27:39.16
And the new port news did turn around and we started steaming.

1161
01:27:39.16 --> 01:27:40.88
And our junk...

1162
01:27:40.88 --> 01:27:41.88
Woody was on the other junk.

1163
01:27:41.88 --> 01:27:44.000
Our junk got there first.

1164
01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:45.60
And we passed down.

1165
01:27:45.60 --> 01:27:49.000
I was a...

1166
01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:51.08
Boatson chair, then we passed down.

1167
01:27:51.08 --> 01:27:55.40
Rigor, then we put Tommy inside that and he got him up there.

1168
01:27:55.40 --> 01:28:01.08
And I actually picked Tommy up out of it and carried him down because the thing was too

1169
01:28:01.08 --> 01:28:02.32
wide to get through the hatch.

1170
01:28:02.32 --> 01:28:06.92
So I picked Tommy back up and carried him down and laid him on the gurney and the doctor's

1171
01:28:06.92 --> 01:28:07.92
office.

1172
01:28:07.92 --> 01:28:12.96
And then I got called to the bridge to debrief the admiral.

1173
01:28:12.96 --> 01:28:14.40
What would go on?

1174
01:28:14.40 --> 01:28:19.92
This is again a great find by Dick Couch, another seal that wrote the book, another

1175
01:28:19.92 --> 01:28:21.72
Vietnam seal.

1176
01:28:21.72 --> 01:28:25.84
And he found a guy named Chuck Zender.

1177
01:28:25.84 --> 01:28:30.88
And Chuck Zender was a corpsman on the USS Newport News.

1178
01:28:30.88 --> 01:28:35.52
And I'm not sure why Dick Couch found him or how that worked, but he's the guy that

1179
01:28:35.52 --> 01:28:37.000
he found.

1180
01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:45.44
And he's talking about when you guys came on board and what was interesting was that

1181
01:28:45.44 --> 01:28:46.84
a few months before.

1182
01:28:46.84 --> 01:28:53.40
Actually, a month earlier they had a turret explosion on the USS Newport News.

1183
01:28:53.40 --> 01:28:57.000
And it killed 11.

1184
01:28:57.000 --> 01:29:01.24
11 and wounded 62.

1185
01:29:01.24 --> 01:29:06.28
And so they these the medical staff on that was they were kind of primed.

1186
01:29:06.28 --> 01:29:07.92
Luckily they were used to.

1187
01:29:07.92 --> 01:29:12.92
They had just been through basically a horrible mass casualty drill and they were somewhat

1188
01:29:12.92 --> 01:29:15.48
ready for it, which again by the grace of God.

1189
01:29:15.48 --> 01:29:19.92
They were there some recent experience with dealing with wounded.

1190
01:29:19.92 --> 01:29:21.52
And so that's why they were ready for this.

1191
01:29:21.52 --> 01:29:24.52
And that's according to Chuck Zender, this this corpsman.

1192
01:29:24.52 --> 01:29:29.48
And here's here's Chuck Zender talking, when they came aboard, they were pretty scruffy

1193
01:29:29.48 --> 01:29:30.48
lot.

1194
01:29:30.48 --> 01:29:33.16
My job in handling casualties was triage.

1195
01:29:33.16 --> 01:29:37.56
I saw them first evaluated them and sent them onto a senior medical person corpsman

1196
01:29:37.56 --> 01:29:39.36
or doctor for treatment.

1197
01:29:39.36 --> 01:29:43.52
I remember seeing this one American I couldn't believe his head wound.

1198
01:29:43.52 --> 01:29:46.36
His forehead was simply blown away.

1199
01:29:46.36 --> 01:29:47.80
I had two thoughts.

1200
01:29:47.80 --> 01:29:52.56
One, it was a good thing he was in salt water or he had a blood to death.

1201
01:29:52.56 --> 01:29:58.28
My second thought was this man will not be alive in the morning.

1202
01:29:58.28 --> 01:30:06.000
He went straight to doctor for Cheerio, for Cheerio, who was waiting for him in surgery.

1203
01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:11.32
There was this big guy who was with him and he carried him from the fan tail to the sick

1204
01:30:11.32 --> 01:30:12.52
bay.

1205
01:30:12.52 --> 01:30:16.24
We had to force him to let go so we could treat him.

1206
01:30:16.24 --> 01:30:23.92
He wanted to go into surgery with him.

1207
01:30:23.92 --> 01:30:24.92
So that was you.

1208
01:30:24.92 --> 01:30:26.92
So obviously.

1209
01:30:26.92 --> 01:30:37.24
And he also said that when they came out and said, hey, we need to check you out and you

1210
01:30:37.24 --> 01:30:39.88
looked and you said no, the Tommy comes first.

1211
01:30:39.88 --> 01:30:45.04
The rest of us can wait.

1212
01:30:45.04 --> 01:30:48.84
This is Chuck's under talking again while we were treating the Vietnamese seals.

1213
01:30:48.84 --> 01:30:50.88
I kept my eye on the big American.

1214
01:30:50.88 --> 01:30:53.32
I finally got him to sit down so we could look him over.

1215
01:30:53.32 --> 01:30:56.56
I saw blood on his pant leg and I cut into his trouser.

1216
01:30:56.56 --> 01:30:58.20
I saw bullet hole on his leg.

1217
01:30:58.20 --> 01:31:01.68
My eyes got big and I called another corpsman over to look at it.

1218
01:31:01.68 --> 01:31:06.96
I said we better treat that and the seal said something like, yeah, whatever.

1219
01:31:06.96 --> 01:31:09.36
He just didn't seem to care.

1220
01:31:09.36 --> 01:31:15.000
When he did care about the others and kept asking about them, especially his lieutenant.

1221
01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:18.96
We knew he was a lieutenant because the other big American seal said he was.

1222
01:31:18.96 --> 01:31:25.32
He had no rank and signal on him.

1223
01:31:25.32 --> 01:31:37.76
So again, your number one priority is your teammates for another person.

1224
01:31:37.76 --> 01:31:40.56
So you guys make it back.

1225
01:31:40.56 --> 01:31:46.60
The ship gets you back to land, Tommy eventually gets casualty of evacuation to the

1226
01:31:46.60 --> 01:31:47.60
Philippines.

1227
01:31:47.60 --> 01:31:57.000
Yeah, I got on the radio and Ryan McCumbee and we met at Tommy off by helicopter to

1228
01:31:57.000 --> 01:32:02.28
denying and Ryan flew down on a helicopter and he was waiting in denying and Ryan

1229
01:32:02.28 --> 01:32:06.28
stayed with Tommy the nice Senate 141.

1230
01:32:06.28 --> 01:32:14.12
Well, we knew we were going to be at our POW, but people like that out.

1231
01:32:14.12 --> 01:32:18.72
So all the top doctors, you know, your surgeons, all those guys were over there because

1232
01:32:18.72 --> 01:32:22.12
they had already pulled everybody out of Vietnam with the exception.

1233
01:32:22.12 --> 01:32:24.80
I just general practitioners.

1234
01:32:24.80 --> 01:32:29.48
And by the time we got Tommy through the whole operation, you got him to the Philippines

1235
01:32:29.48 --> 01:32:30.72
to Clarks.

1236
01:32:30.72 --> 01:32:38.44
It was almost 19 hours long, the Metavac, then his operation lasted 19 1.5 hours, his first

1237
01:32:38.44 --> 01:32:40.04
operation.

1238
01:32:40.04 --> 01:32:43.28
And they stayed in touch with us, but I stayed on board the new port and used to the

1239
01:32:43.28 --> 01:32:50.08
following day to take care of the Vietnamese spoke English, but I spoke pretty, I mean,

1240
01:32:50.08 --> 01:32:57.80
I was fluent in Vietnamese and so I stayed on there until we got them all packed up.

1241
01:32:57.80 --> 01:33:01.80
This is the doctor talking major Walter Grand.

1242
01:33:01.80 --> 01:33:06.52
He's the neurosurgeon that they had to get this guy get Tommy Norris to in the Philippines.

1243
01:33:06.52 --> 01:33:11.44
And he says, when he arrived, we took him directly into the OR.

1244
01:33:11.44 --> 01:33:16.92
At the time, General Military Battlefield Protocol held that the patient needed to be,

1245
01:33:16.92 --> 01:33:21.04
needed to be, or should be conscious going into surgery.

1246
01:33:21.04 --> 01:33:25.24
And I was surprised that someone with this series of a head wound would be conscious and

1247
01:33:25.24 --> 01:33:28.04
conversant, fortunately he was.

1248
01:33:28.04 --> 01:33:32.12
He was still dressed in his operational gear, which were blue jeans and a black t-shirt

1249
01:33:32.12 --> 01:33:33.92
as some kind.

1250
01:33:33.92 --> 01:33:38.52
As I was conducting my initial examination, I remember that he was conscious, but just

1251
01:33:38.52 --> 01:33:39.52
barely.

1252
01:33:39.52 --> 01:33:43.64
I could tell he'd been through a lot.

1253
01:33:43.64 --> 01:33:49.48
Then he seemed to come more alert and ask, sir, can you tell me about my men?

1254
01:33:49.48 --> 01:33:55.20
I know we got them all off the beach, but can you tell me if they're okay?

1255
01:33:55.20 --> 01:34:06.48
That's the team's.

1256
01:34:06.48 --> 01:34:13.52
Now they get done with the surgery that you're talking about incredibly long surgery.

1257
01:34:13.52 --> 01:34:19.52
And here's the doctor talking again on removing the bandage and inspecting the wound.

1258
01:34:19.52 --> 01:34:26.56
We talked and I sensed that he didn't know that he no longer had a left eye.

1259
01:34:26.56 --> 01:34:31.76
I was reluctant to tell him as he had endured a great deal, but he was a pretty tough fellow,

1260
01:34:31.76 --> 01:34:37.52
so I told him that we were unable to save his left eye.

1261
01:34:37.52 --> 01:34:40.48
He thought about it for a second.

1262
01:34:40.48 --> 01:34:46.000
And then said, do you think they'll kick me out of the Navy because of that?

1263
01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:50.64
I said that I couldn't really answer that, but I took it as a good sign that he still

1264
01:34:50.64 --> 01:34:55.56
wanted to be a seal.

1265
01:34:55.56 --> 01:34:59.84
In the funny part, it wasn't the eye as much as it was, the loss of the front-level part

1266
01:34:59.84 --> 01:35:00.84
of his brain.

1267
01:35:00.84 --> 01:35:03.84
I actually don't think that's funny, sir.

1268
01:35:03.84 --> 01:35:06.84
I don't think it is either.

1269
01:35:06.84 --> 01:35:11.16
So when you say that, what do you mean that what was the, you're saying, hey, they're

1270
01:35:11.16 --> 01:35:14.04
not going to kick you out of the even though you've lost part of your brain?

1271
01:35:14.04 --> 01:35:19.04
Well, I think that was one of the, we talked about it because he wanted to stay.

1272
01:35:19.04 --> 01:35:24.40
And he was already chosen to be a lieutenant commander at that period of time.

1273
01:35:24.40 --> 01:35:29.88
And of course, you own medical hold that goes to stop.

1274
01:35:29.88 --> 01:35:33.36
But Tommy would have been a great, he would have been a great admiral.

1275
01:35:33.36 --> 01:35:37.80
I mean, he really would have done a proud, as of Ryan McCombie too.

1276
01:35:37.80 --> 01:35:43.44
And a few other guys who didn't go up through the ranks of, to the top, but we've had

1277
01:35:43.44 --> 01:35:51.32
some great leadership up there and Eric Olson, Bill McCraven, Joe McCjock,

1278
01:35:51.32 --> 01:35:54.72
Carnon, McGuire, the Burke Allen.

1279
01:35:54.72 --> 01:36:00.40
I mean, the way you look at, I watched the teams grow from, yeah, of, O'Four was as high

1280
01:36:00.40 --> 01:36:02.12
as you could go and still be in the teams.

1281
01:36:02.12 --> 01:36:03.88
And now look at the, look at their thing.

1282
01:36:03.88 --> 01:36:09.56
And the guys who just amazed me every time I look and read something or something, how

1283
01:36:09.56 --> 01:36:13.40
much, I'm so proud of each one of these young men who serve as great nation.

1284
01:36:13.40 --> 01:36:21.24
Yeah, it's amazing again that the attitudes just constant.

1285
01:36:21.24 --> 01:36:24.80
And you know, I had this with my guys that got wounded and none of them wanted to go home.

1286
01:36:24.80 --> 01:36:26.08
They wanted to just stay.

1287
01:36:26.08 --> 01:36:27.08
Yeah.

1288
01:36:27.08 --> 01:36:28.68
They didn't care if they just had to stay in watch.

1289
01:36:28.68 --> 01:36:31.52
They wanted to stay with us in Iraq.

1290
01:36:31.52 --> 01:36:36.68
Well, you know, I mean, how proud all you guys were when we were there that molossin

1291
01:36:36.68 --> 01:36:40.72
and you guys were saving your words and the Pentagon, you know, after Mike E. Montzure.

1292
01:36:40.72 --> 01:36:49.60
And you know, you look at the guys are and Joe and those guys, of course, you know, he

1293
01:36:49.60 --> 01:36:53.88
lost his life in a very basic operation.

1294
01:36:53.88 --> 01:36:59.32
But you know, even though when they had the diversity against them, they continued to

1295
01:36:59.32 --> 01:37:01.32
strive to make their life better.

1296
01:37:01.32 --> 01:37:03.20
Well, Ryan Joe was the classic example.

1297
01:37:03.20 --> 01:37:04.80
Don't you know, he was blind and both eyes.

1298
01:37:04.80 --> 01:37:07.60
He was telling me, he wanted, he was already back in America.

1299
01:37:07.60 --> 01:37:10.68
And he's on the phone telling me, can I please come back to Iraq?

1300
01:37:10.68 --> 01:37:11.68
I want to be with the platoon.

1301
01:37:11.68 --> 01:37:12.68
Yeah.

1302
01:37:12.68 --> 01:37:13.68
Yeah.

1303
01:37:13.68 --> 01:37:16.12
And he goes and gets his college education.

1304
01:37:16.12 --> 01:37:17.68
He has a beautiful family.

1305
01:37:17.68 --> 01:37:23.64
And he's, I remember there when I was able to put the purple heart on him and Tommy and I

1306
01:37:23.64 --> 01:37:27.000
were there with Admiral Olson, of course.

1307
01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:28.76
Was that in Epiphesda?

1308
01:37:28.76 --> 01:37:29.76
Where was that?

1309
01:37:29.76 --> 01:37:30.76
Was that in the hospital?

1310
01:37:30.76 --> 01:37:31.76
No, no, no.

1311
01:37:31.76 --> 01:37:32.76
He was at the Pentagon.

1312
01:37:32.76 --> 01:37:33.76
Oh, I didn't want to say anything.

1313
01:37:33.76 --> 01:37:34.76
Oh, I didn't want to say anything.

1314
01:37:34.76 --> 01:37:36.76
It was the one that we had for you guys, the big ones.

1315
01:37:36.76 --> 01:37:40.04
And then we went down and he gave other from the team three.

1316
01:37:40.04 --> 01:37:42.04
We gave a Collin Green was there.

1317
01:37:42.04 --> 01:37:43.04
Yeah.

1318
01:37:43.04 --> 01:37:44.04
Yeah, this is the top of the exhaust.

1319
01:37:44.04 --> 01:37:45.04
It was the task.

1320
01:37:45.04 --> 01:37:48.04
You know, Bruce or a Ward ceremony at the Pentagon.

1321
01:37:48.04 --> 01:37:49.04
Yeah.

1322
01:37:49.04 --> 01:37:54.04
We were all pretty surprised to be there doing that.

1323
01:37:54.04 --> 01:37:57.04
But yeah, Ryan Job, so you guys put the purple heart on him there.

1324
01:37:57.04 --> 01:37:58.04
Yeah, got it.

1325
01:37:58.04 --> 01:38:03.04
Yeah, he's had the same attitude that you hear from Tommy and I was, hey, can I stay in?

1326
01:38:03.04 --> 01:38:04.04
Can I be there?

1327
01:38:04.04 --> 01:38:08.04
Be with the guys.

1328
01:38:08.04 --> 01:38:12.04
How much longer were you in Vietnam after that operation?

1329
01:38:12.04 --> 01:38:23.04
That was October 31st and I came home on a break in November and I came home for good in January.

1330
01:38:23.04 --> 01:38:29.04
So then everybody left in March of 73.

1331
01:38:29.04 --> 01:38:36.04
And Woody and run the rest of the guys they stayed there and they came back as a little final thing.

1332
01:38:36.04 --> 01:38:40.04
And it broke see and Woody and a Chamberlain and Harry kind of cool.

1333
01:38:40.04 --> 01:38:44.04
And all those guys Brad Bill Bradford and stuff.

1334
01:38:44.04 --> 01:38:48.04
And that was the last sales of course.

1335
01:38:48.04 --> 01:38:54.04
And we got involved with Delta Baton, you know, with the Cambodia issue and all that kind of stuff.

1336
01:38:54.04 --> 01:38:57.04
And the Philippines and stuff like that.

1337
01:38:57.04 --> 01:39:01.04
You uh, you talk about coming home here.

1338
01:39:01.04 --> 01:39:05.04
I'm going to the book coming back to the team this time was different from my first Vietnam tour.

1339
01:39:05.04 --> 01:39:12.04
When you were labeled a one tour wonder, which is by the way, still what you get called in this day and age.

1340
01:39:12.04 --> 01:39:15.04
You come home from your first deployment or even from my Thailand tour.

1341
01:39:15.04 --> 01:39:21.04
At Seal team one, you were not a made man until after your second combat rotation.

1342
01:39:21.04 --> 01:39:27.04
It was not so much respect from the team veterans as many of them had been on four or five combat rotations.

1343
01:39:27.04 --> 01:39:30.04
It had more to do with acceptance.

1344
01:39:30.04 --> 01:39:38.04
I was now one of them. When guys like Gary Gallagher and Walt Gustavl and Doc Seal came up to you and said,

1345
01:39:38.04 --> 01:39:42.04
Nice job over there or good work getting your lieutenant back off that beach.

1346
01:39:42.04 --> 01:39:46.04
It really meant something.

1347
01:39:46.04 --> 01:39:56.04
There was also getting to know my kid who thought I was some stranger, which I was and getting reacquainted with my wife.

1348
01:39:56.04 --> 01:40:00.04
I've been gone more than I was at home since we were married.

1349
01:40:00.04 --> 01:40:04.04
And there was the absence of combat.

1350
01:40:04.04 --> 01:40:14.04
Both the worrying of having to go in the field and in some ways missing the anticipation of getting ready to go on an operation.

1351
01:40:14.04 --> 01:40:18.04
And the rush that comes from combat.

1352
01:40:18.04 --> 01:40:24.04
I looked at all this as normal for any seal coming home, but it was still an adjustment.

1353
01:40:24.04 --> 01:40:28.04
So you guys same stuff the guys go through now.

1354
01:40:28.04 --> 01:40:32.04
Same exact stuff guys go through now.

1355
01:40:32.04 --> 01:40:35.04
And our spouses don't get enough credit for what they do.

1356
01:40:35.04 --> 01:40:41.04
I mean they raise our kids, families they take on stuff that we should be there to try to help them with.

1357
01:40:41.04 --> 01:40:46.04
But we have amazing spouses in the teams too.

1358
01:40:46.04 --> 01:40:48.04
And we have a lot better.

1359
01:40:48.04 --> 01:40:52.04
The first thing I mentioned my wife is that it was the Navy issue.

1360
01:40:52.04 --> 01:40:56.04
Now we have a whole different outlook thing.

1361
01:40:56.04 --> 01:41:02.04
There are part of our lives and they make it better for all of us.

1362
01:41:02.04 --> 01:41:06.04
The military while all the military wives.

1363
01:41:06.04 --> 01:41:07.04
Oh yeah.

1364
01:41:07.04 --> 01:41:08.04
What they do.

1365
01:41:08.04 --> 01:41:14.04
Yeah they're raising the kids, but they're also fixing water heaters and you know repair and plumbing.

1366
01:41:14.04 --> 01:41:16.04
And they're just doing everything in the house.

1367
01:41:16.04 --> 01:41:20.04
Like we said stuff that we're supposed to be doing for our home.

1368
01:41:20.04 --> 01:41:27.04
So they had to put up with all the BS with a man taking a car in there trying to sell.

1369
01:41:27.04 --> 01:41:33.04
I know how to change all of the, they said you know, try to pull that one over my eyes.

1370
01:41:33.04 --> 01:41:37.04
Now going back to the book, this is you talking.

1371
01:41:37.04 --> 01:41:40.04
I was notified in September that I would receive the Medal of Honor.

1372
01:41:40.04 --> 01:41:44.04
I locked those through your mind when something like that is going to happen to you.

1373
01:41:44.04 --> 01:41:47.04
You try and play it down in your mind like it's no big deal.

1374
01:41:47.04 --> 01:41:50.04
But it really is a big deal.

1375
01:41:50.04 --> 01:41:53.04
Everyone in uniform knows it's a big deal.

1376
01:41:53.04 --> 01:41:57.04
I felt humbled and undeserving.

1377
01:41:57.04 --> 01:42:03.04
And I swore that I was not going to change me.

1378
01:42:03.04 --> 01:42:12.04
Well you know, Mike Thorns always been a renegade and probably always will be a renegade.

1379
01:42:12.04 --> 01:42:17.04
And then I want to let it change me.

1380
01:42:17.04 --> 01:42:20.04
When I went back to get the medal, they wouldn't let Tommy out of the hospital.

1381
01:42:20.04 --> 01:42:22.04
So I kid never.

1382
01:42:22.04 --> 01:42:25.04
So Tommy was still recovering from the head of the house.

1383
01:42:25.04 --> 01:42:26.04
Yes, he was still.

1384
01:42:26.04 --> 01:42:28.04
And this is this is what a year later.

1385
01:42:28.04 --> 01:42:29.04
Yeah, a year later.

1386
01:42:29.04 --> 01:42:34.04
And Tommy still, I mean, he's just going through all these all the surgeries and everything else.

1387
01:42:34.04 --> 01:42:38.04
I mean, Tommy went through surgeries for six and a half years and still goes even now.

1388
01:42:38.04 --> 01:42:40.04
So you know, it's unbelievable.

1389
01:42:40.04 --> 01:42:43.04
I mean, so I was.

1390
01:42:43.04 --> 01:42:45.04
But they wouldn't let him out of the hospital go to your ceremony.

1391
01:42:45.04 --> 01:42:49.04
So I said, hey, this is not, I said, I'll bring him back.

1392
01:42:49.04 --> 01:42:53.04
You know, they said, no, I said, well, I'm going to get in trouble when I take him out.

1393
01:42:53.04 --> 01:42:56.04
So I kept him for four days, put him my hotel and never feel his name.

1394
01:42:56.04 --> 01:43:03.04
And everybody in the world's looking for it in the surgeon general of the Navy, which is a three-star, put me on report.

1395
01:43:03.04 --> 01:43:06.04
And how to go to Adonels and Master does.

1396
01:43:06.04 --> 01:43:09.04
That's not my first one.

1397
01:43:09.04 --> 01:43:19.04
You know, Tony Frady, who is the Charlie Petir and Chief, we used to talk about Mike Forton and we'd say, you know, just on random days, we'd say, hey, you know what Mike Forton's doing today?

1398
01:43:19.04 --> 01:43:25.04
Whatever Mike Forton wants to do today.

1399
01:43:25.04 --> 01:43:34.04
So you just smuggled him out of the hospital against orders, went to Adonels, masked.

1400
01:43:34.04 --> 01:43:40.04
You talk a little bit about the ceremony here, going back to the book, we showed up at the White House for the ceremony.

1401
01:43:40.04 --> 01:43:44.04
Then we were all taken into the oval office and I was presented with the medal.

1402
01:43:44.04 --> 01:43:49.04
I'll never forget President Nixon saying, Mike, what can I do for you?

1403
01:43:49.04 --> 01:44:06.04
And I said, well, Mr. President, you could break this medal in half and give the other half to this young man, which was Tom Norris, you were pointing to, standing behind me, because he saved my life too.

1404
01:44:06.04 --> 01:44:15.04
So again, even in the end there, you are, you're looking out for your teammate.

1405
01:44:15.04 --> 01:44:20.04
All the way through.

1406
01:44:20.04 --> 01:44:25.04
We still look at it for each other even today after 46 years.

1407
01:44:25.04 --> 01:44:31.04
So I never, it's a job that you never give up.

1408
01:44:31.04 --> 01:44:40.04
Well, the book, like I said, I mean, we've covered a fraction of the book and it gives so much more detail.

1409
01:44:40.04 --> 01:44:55.04
It goes on to talk about the rest of your Navy career. It goes on to talk about, and obviously it talks about Tommy Norris's career as the FBI agent, by the way, went into the FBI and wasn't undercover operative.

1410
01:44:55.04 --> 01:44:57.04
I mean, just unbelievable.

1411
01:44:57.04 --> 01:44:59.04
Unbelievable.

1412
01:44:59.04 --> 01:45:06.04
You got to get this book so that you can get the full details of what I'm talking about.

1413
01:45:06.04 --> 01:45:16.04
And the last thing I wanted to read from the book is the citation from your Medal of Honor.

1414
01:45:16.04 --> 01:45:21.04
Please don't.

1415
01:45:21.04 --> 01:45:24.04
They can go on one or read it.

1416
01:45:24.04 --> 01:45:33.04
But the book's called By Honor, Found Ladies and gentlemen, I never felt I deserve them.

1417
01:45:33.04 --> 01:45:36.04
I never felt I would deserve them, but you know that.

1418
01:45:36.04 --> 01:45:42.04
I wear that with the honor of the men in women who served before me served with me in served after me.

1419
01:45:42.04 --> 01:45:44.04
But a lot of people don't know.

1420
01:45:44.04 --> 01:45:48.04
We've lost to me in 853,000 people.

1421
01:45:48.04 --> 01:45:51.04
This great nation does enjoy our freedom today.

1422
01:45:51.04 --> 01:45:53.04
And that's who we can never forget.

1423
01:45:53.04 --> 01:45:55.04
And freedom is not free.

1424
01:45:55.04 --> 01:45:59.04
And we must honor each and every one of them.

1425
01:45:59.04 --> 01:46:03.04
And they all deserve the Medal of Skill and their lives for a great nation.

1426
01:46:03.04 --> 01:46:10.04
Of course, Mikey Munsour, like I said before, what a great young man I knew Mikey.

1427
01:46:10.04 --> 01:46:14.04
And I feel for all our girls, star families.

1428
01:46:14.04 --> 01:46:18.04
Because I've never, not come wood, I've never lost a child.

1429
01:46:18.04 --> 01:46:21.04
But I've lost a lot of a lot of close great friends.

1430
01:46:21.04 --> 01:46:28.04
And I know what part of that they're going through, but you know, until you lose a child,

1431
01:46:28.04 --> 01:46:30.04
a child of your own.

1432
01:46:30.04 --> 01:46:33.04
That you've got as blessed you to give.

1433
01:46:33.04 --> 01:46:36.04
It's hard to people to understand, but free is not free.

1434
01:46:36.04 --> 01:46:39.04
It's written in blood as you know, Chuck.

1435
01:46:42.04 --> 01:46:46.04
Well, yeah.

1436
01:46:46.04 --> 01:46:53.04
And you know, I can't even fathom for what it's like to lose a child.

1437
01:46:53.04 --> 01:46:57.04
I know, you know, it's, um,

1438
01:46:57.04 --> 01:47:00.04
I can't even fathom.

1439
01:47:00.04 --> 01:47:08.04
And, you know, when I hear people throwing the word here all around, you know,

1440
01:47:08.04 --> 01:47:15.04
I always, I always say what I hear a lot of veterans say,

1441
01:47:15.04 --> 01:47:20.04
and that is the real heroes didn't come home.

1442
01:47:20.04 --> 01:47:23.04
Well, I agree with you.

1443
01:47:23.04 --> 01:47:25.04
But at least we did get them home.

1444
01:47:25.04 --> 01:47:30.04
And we still continue to try to get the ones that remains of the ones home.

1445
01:47:30.04 --> 01:47:34.04
Um,

1446
01:47:34.04 --> 01:47:41.04
Well, you know, the, like I said,

1447
01:47:41.04 --> 01:47:45.04
if you go and get this book,

1448
01:47:45.04 --> 01:47:47.04
you can, you can read it.

1449
01:47:47.04 --> 01:47:50.04
You can learn a lot about these operations.

1450
01:47:50.04 --> 01:47:52.04
You can learn a lot about people.

1451
01:47:52.04 --> 01:47:57.04
And what people are capable of.

1452
01:47:57.04 --> 01:48:01.04
And what real sacrifice looks like.

1453
01:48:01.04 --> 01:48:05.04
And, you know, Mike again,

1454
01:48:05.04 --> 01:48:09.04
um,

1455
01:48:09.04 --> 01:48:13.04
like everyone's going to want to tell you and it tells you all the time.

1456
01:48:13.04 --> 01:48:18.04
Thank you for the service that you made for our country.

1457
01:48:18.04 --> 01:48:25.04
But as a seal, I want to say thank you for setting the example that we followed.

1458
01:48:25.04 --> 01:48:30.04
And as a person and as a human being.

1459
01:48:30.04 --> 01:48:39.04
Thank you for showing us that we're all capable of more than we thought.

1460
01:48:39.04 --> 01:48:44.04
And no matter how dire the circumstances,

1461
01:48:44.04 --> 01:48:49.04
no matter how many enemy forces are advancing, no matter how many rounds they're firing at you,

1462
01:48:49.04 --> 01:48:52.04
no how many grenades they throw at you,

1463
01:48:52.04 --> 01:49:01.04
no matter how big the problems that you face in life.

1464
01:49:01.04 --> 01:49:07.04
Never quit on yourself and never quit on each other.

1465
01:49:07.04 --> 01:49:11.04
Very well put, or draco.

1466
01:49:11.04 --> 01:49:15.04
I think we've kept you here long enough.

1467
01:49:15.04 --> 01:49:19.04
Well, echo, I'm sorry you didn't get a whole lot of speaking time there, buddy.

1468
01:49:19.04 --> 01:49:21.04
No, enjoy the list of the things.

1469
01:49:21.04 --> 01:49:23.04
That's what echo does.

1470
01:49:23.04 --> 01:49:25.04
He gets the lucky job.

1471
01:49:25.04 --> 01:49:27.04
He just hit back and listen to all some stories.

1472
01:49:27.04 --> 01:49:29.04
But thanks for coming on.

1473
01:49:29.04 --> 01:49:35.04
As my honor, thank you for what you're doing and getting the word out to the public.

1474
01:49:35.04 --> 01:49:42.04
I've been, because as like I say, freedom is not free ladies and gentlemen, freedom is written and blooded.

1475
01:49:42.04 --> 01:49:44.04
And please don't take advantage of this.

1476
01:49:44.04 --> 01:49:48.04
You know, give back to the ones who are given so much.

1477
01:49:48.04 --> 01:49:51.04
And I guess back to what you and I were talking about too.

1478
01:49:51.04 --> 01:49:59.04
I mean, the wives, the children, the sacrifices they make for their spouses to go overseas and keep

1479
01:49:59.04 --> 01:50:00.04
this nation free.

1480
01:50:00.04 --> 01:50:03.04
And what's the organization that you have now?

1481
01:50:03.04 --> 01:50:06.04
This called the Michael E. Thornton Foundation, the Met Fund.

1482
01:50:06.04 --> 01:50:09.04
We give out money.

1483
01:50:09.04 --> 01:50:14.04
And I don't give out, you know, 50,000 or 100,000.

1484
01:50:14.04 --> 01:50:18.04
I give out 10,000 here and 5,000 there.

1485
01:50:18.04 --> 01:50:24.04
And our Met Foundation, basically, or I'll give out 20,000.

1486
01:50:24.04 --> 01:50:27.04
And just a couple examples.

1487
01:50:27.04 --> 01:50:29.04
One was a young Marine came back.

1488
01:50:29.04 --> 01:50:30.04
He was a corporal.

1489
01:50:30.04 --> 01:50:31.04
They retired him.

1490
01:50:31.04 --> 01:50:37.04
But of course, it now takes a beating word from 19 months to two years to get into the VA.

1491
01:50:37.04 --> 01:50:42.04
He had these bad headaches, but he didn't have enough money to pay for his co-payments.

1492
01:50:42.04 --> 01:50:45.04
So I write a check to the MRI to the hospital.

1493
01:50:45.04 --> 01:50:46.04
I wrote the right to check.

1494
01:50:46.04 --> 01:50:47.04
They're doing MRI.

1495
01:50:47.04 --> 01:50:52.04
Find out he had a brain aneurysm and was able to say the young man's life.

1496
01:50:52.04 --> 01:50:55.04
Another one, we had a guy in Special Ops.

1497
01:50:55.04 --> 01:50:58.04
He was an Air Force Major, Intel Officer at J.S.

1498
01:50:58.04 --> 01:51:01.04
He was over season.

1499
01:51:01.04 --> 01:51:04.04
His wife got done with the stage for cancer.

1500
01:51:04.04 --> 01:51:06.04
We put her in the Duke University.

1501
01:51:06.04 --> 01:51:08.04
I try to save her life.

1502
01:51:08.04 --> 01:51:12.04
Our friend, Dima, goes back to the day when we started SIL team six.

1503
01:51:12.04 --> 01:51:14.04
And along with started J.S.

1504
01:51:14.04 --> 01:51:15.04
I can 1980.

1505
01:51:15.04 --> 01:51:17.04
He was our chaplain.

1506
01:51:17.04 --> 01:51:18.04
He was a Catholic chaplain.

1507
01:51:18.04 --> 01:51:21.04
And he calls him and said, Mike, I hear you get a great foundation.

1508
01:51:21.04 --> 01:51:22.04
I have a problem.

1509
01:51:22.04 --> 01:51:23.04
I said, well, I need your problem.

1510
01:51:23.04 --> 01:51:25.04
I do, I do diligence.

1511
01:51:25.04 --> 01:51:30.04
We're able to get their kids into this, back to this Christian school.

1512
01:51:30.04 --> 01:51:36.04
Which all the kids, they're right from the age of seven to ten or eleven.

1513
01:51:36.04 --> 01:51:37.04
I can't remember.

1514
01:51:37.04 --> 01:51:42.04
And there's three of them, but they had spent their whole school time there.

1515
01:51:42.04 --> 01:51:45.04
But the father calls us the coal payments.

1516
01:51:45.04 --> 01:51:49.04
We said, I'd already built up to like a hundred something thousand laws for the coal payments.

1517
01:51:49.04 --> 01:51:54.04
I paid for the kids to wish and wrote a check, which was a little bit over eighteen thousand dollars.

1518
01:51:54.04 --> 01:51:57.04
You know, for all, put them back in there.

1519
01:51:57.04 --> 01:52:00.04
But at least they had a stable platform.

1520
01:52:00.04 --> 01:52:03.04
And everybody knew what was going with the mother.

1521
01:52:03.04 --> 01:52:04.04
Yeah.

1522
01:52:04.04 --> 01:52:06.04
All the teachers knew the kids and stuff like that.

1523
01:52:06.04 --> 01:52:12.04
And then at that period of time, I go back and I make some phone calls to some good friends of mine in New York City.

1524
01:52:12.04 --> 01:52:16.04
And they took care of the over the hundred something thousand dollar coal payments.

1525
01:52:16.04 --> 01:52:19.04
So I put a bandaid on the problem.

1526
01:52:19.04 --> 01:52:20.04
And then I try to go other.

1527
01:52:20.04 --> 01:52:23.04
But I mean, the call for fires and for it.

1528
01:52:23.04 --> 01:52:24.04
Yeah.

1529
01:52:24.04 --> 01:52:29.04
But I mean, I worked with the Navy Civil Foundation, Navy Civil Family Foundation.

1530
01:52:29.04 --> 01:52:34.04
We worked with keeping our history of the museum.

1531
01:52:34.04 --> 01:52:44.04
It was John Lee does a great job that we do up at Pebble Beach, the Marine Corps Law Enforcement Foundation, which is the number one foundation.

1532
01:52:44.04 --> 01:52:48.04
In the nation, it give or ninety nine cents of every dollar raised.

1533
01:52:48.04 --> 01:52:51.04
And I give ninety seven cents of every dollar raised.

1534
01:52:51.04 --> 01:52:53.04
I do have one administrator.

1535
01:52:53.04 --> 01:52:59.04
I pay for some of my wife and I can travel around and take care of that.

1536
01:52:59.04 --> 01:53:02.04
But there's some great foundations out there.

1537
01:53:02.04 --> 01:53:05.04
I just tell them, make sure you do your due diligence on their foundations.

1538
01:53:05.04 --> 01:53:09.04
You just go online and check them out and if they're four store or five store.

1539
01:53:09.04 --> 01:53:10.04
And find out.

1540
01:53:10.04 --> 01:53:16.04
But all the foundations I work with is going to give at least ninety four cents of every dollar raised.

1541
01:53:16.04 --> 01:53:17.04
Out for the calls.

1542
01:53:17.04 --> 01:53:19.04
Where can they find your foundation?

1543
01:53:19.04 --> 01:53:22.04
Just pull up the matte fund.

1544
01:53:22.04 --> 01:53:23.04
Okay.

1545
01:53:23.04 --> 01:53:24.04
Online is MET.

1546
01:53:24.04 --> 01:53:25.04
Yeah.

1547
01:53:25.04 --> 01:53:26.04
Fund.

1548
01:53:26.04 --> 01:53:28.04
The matte fund or the Michael Lee Thornton.

1549
01:53:28.04 --> 01:53:30.04
I put my name on the book.

1550
01:53:30.04 --> 01:53:32.04
Stop for the May of some nice point fingers.

1551
01:53:32.04 --> 01:53:33.04
They only get one finger to point.

1552
01:53:33.04 --> 01:53:35.04
I'll take full responsibility.

1553
01:53:35.04 --> 01:53:36.04
What I do.

1554
01:53:36.04 --> 01:53:37.04
So it's always half.

1555
01:53:37.04 --> 01:53:39.04
You know, don't do.

1556
01:53:39.04 --> 01:53:42.04
And I have people like Bob Kerry, Congress.

1557
01:53:42.04 --> 01:53:44.04
And just be a nut metal of honor.

1558
01:53:44.04 --> 01:53:45.04
Some of my board.

1559
01:53:45.04 --> 01:53:47.04
I have an admiral on my board.

1560
01:53:47.04 --> 01:53:50.04
I have two really great business men on my board.

1561
01:53:50.04 --> 01:53:55.04
And I have supports of people all already on states.

1562
01:53:55.04 --> 01:53:56.04
Which helps support.

1563
01:53:56.04 --> 01:53:59.04
They call as they said they used to give money to other foundations.

1564
01:53:59.04 --> 01:54:01.04
But they didn't like the way the money was made.

1565
01:54:01.04 --> 01:54:02.04
It supported.

1566
01:54:02.04 --> 01:54:03.04
So they give me the.

1567
01:54:03.04 --> 01:54:06.04
And I and like I say, we.

1568
01:54:06.04 --> 01:54:07.04
Make sure we take here.

1569
01:54:07.04 --> 01:54:11.04
I mean, if like my blows up the engine, I have the engine.

1570
01:54:11.04 --> 01:54:12.04
Having a bad month.

1571
01:54:12.04 --> 01:54:13.04
They got laid off.

1572
01:54:13.04 --> 01:54:15.04
And we pay for the ramp.

1573
01:54:15.04 --> 01:54:24.04
We write the check to the we don't give it to the person we give it to the complex or we give it to the hospital or we give it to the doctor.

1574
01:54:24.04 --> 01:54:27.04
So that way I know the money is going where it's supposed to be going.

1575
01:54:27.04 --> 01:54:32.04
So they can get the take care of their problems.

1576
01:54:32.04 --> 01:54:35.04
Well, obviously, your service isn't quite over yet.

1577
01:54:35.04 --> 01:54:40.04
You're still serving in still helping veterans and seals across the board.

1578
01:54:40.04 --> 01:54:43.04
And once again, sir, thank you for coming on.

1579
01:54:43.04 --> 01:54:45.04
It's been an honor knowing you.

1580
01:54:45.04 --> 01:54:47.04
It's been an honor talking to you.

1581
01:54:47.04 --> 01:54:49.04
And I look forward to talking to you again.

1582
01:54:49.04 --> 01:54:50.04
So we will.

1583
01:54:50.04 --> 01:54:51.04
Just keep going.

1584
01:54:51.04 --> 01:54:53.04
Once you're doing it, I go keep them out of trouble.

1585
01:54:53.04 --> 01:54:54.04
Yes, sir.

1586
01:54:54.04 --> 01:54:56.04
Thank you very much for having me.

1587
01:54:56.04 --> 01:54:58.04
Thank you.

1588
01:54:58.04 --> 01:54:59.04
All right.

1589
01:54:59.04 --> 01:55:02.04
We just took a technical break.

1590
01:55:02.04 --> 01:55:05.04
And Mike Ford has left the building.

1591
01:55:05.04 --> 01:55:06.04
Yeah.

1592
01:55:06.04 --> 01:55:08.04
And went to go do what Mike Ford does.

1593
01:55:08.04 --> 01:55:09.04
Whatever you want.

1594
01:55:09.04 --> 01:55:10.04
Which is pretty much whatever you want.

1595
01:55:10.04 --> 01:55:13.04
And it was awesome. Obviously.

1596
01:55:13.04 --> 01:55:14.04
Have fun.

1597
01:55:14.04 --> 01:55:15.04
Agreed.

1598
01:55:15.04 --> 01:55:19.04
And when Mike Ford tells you, don't read my citation.

1599
01:55:19.04 --> 01:55:20.04
You don't read the citation.

1600
01:55:20.04 --> 01:55:21.04
Simple as that.

1601
01:55:21.04 --> 01:55:22.04
No, no, no.

1602
01:55:22.04 --> 01:55:23.04
No factor.

1603
01:55:23.04 --> 01:55:24.04
Yes.

1604
01:55:24.04 --> 01:55:25.04
No factor at all.

1605
01:55:25.04 --> 01:55:26.04
Yeah.

1606
01:55:26.04 --> 01:55:27.04
Well, I need to get it.

1607
01:55:27.04 --> 01:55:28.04
But awesome.

1608
01:55:28.04 --> 01:55:29.04
Have fun.

1609
01:55:29.04 --> 01:55:30.04
Obviously.

1610
01:55:30.04 --> 01:55:33.04
And now.

1611
01:55:33.04 --> 01:55:37.04
We want to keep having people like Mike Ford on the podcast.

1612
01:55:37.04 --> 01:55:41.04
If somebody wanted to help us have people on this podcast.

1613
01:55:41.04 --> 01:55:42.04
Sure.

1614
01:55:42.04 --> 01:55:47.04
Do you have any suggestions on how they could maybe lend to that effort?

1615
01:55:47.04 --> 01:55:47.04
Yeah.

1616
01:55:47.04 --> 01:55:48.04
The support?

1617
01:55:48.04 --> 01:55:49.04
Sure.

1618
01:55:49.04 --> 01:55:50.04
Oh, yeah.

1619
01:55:50.04 --> 01:55:51.04
Basically, that's what I'm saying.

1620
01:55:51.04 --> 01:55:52.04
Wait a support.

1621
01:55:52.04 --> 01:55:53.04
Yeah.

1622
01:55:53.04 --> 01:55:54.04
Of course.

1623
01:55:54.04 --> 01:55:56.04
Here's the way.

1624
01:55:56.04 --> 01:55:58.04
And support yourself.

1625
01:55:58.04 --> 01:56:00.04
What's kind of the thing.

1626
01:56:00.04 --> 01:56:01.04
You know?

1627
01:56:01.04 --> 01:56:03.04
What's good for the goose is good.

1628
01:56:03.04 --> 01:56:04.04
You know what I'm saying?

1629
01:56:04.04 --> 01:56:05.04
Maybe.

1630
01:56:05.04 --> 01:56:06.04
Origin.

1631
01:56:06.04 --> 01:56:09.04
We're in league with origin as you put it.

1632
01:56:09.04 --> 01:56:10.04
Yes.

1633
01:56:10.04 --> 01:56:11.04
I do put it that way.

1634
01:56:11.04 --> 01:56:12.04
Sure.

1635
01:56:12.04 --> 01:56:12.04
Yeah.

1636
01:56:12.04 --> 01:56:13.04
So origin main.

1637
01:56:13.04 --> 01:56:15.04
So origin main the state.

1638
01:56:15.04 --> 01:56:17.04
Just so to be clear.

1639
01:56:17.04 --> 01:56:18.04
Yes.

1640
01:56:18.04 --> 01:56:18.04
Origin.

1641
01:56:18.04 --> 01:56:20.04
I mean, I mean, you might be like main.

1642
01:56:20.04 --> 01:56:22.04
I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean,

1643
01:56:22.04 --> 01:56:23.04
you know, like the state.

1644
01:56:23.04 --> 01:56:25.04
The main one kind of kind of, which makes sense.

1645
01:56:25.04 --> 01:56:26.04
By the way, yeah.

1646
01:56:26.04 --> 01:56:27.04
Yeah.

1647
01:56:27.04 --> 01:56:28.04
Because it is the main one.

1648
01:56:28.04 --> 01:56:29.04
Totally.

1649
01:56:29.04 --> 01:56:32.04
And so, you know, a lot of times.

1650
01:56:32.04 --> 01:56:33.04
Like, okay, we'll take the geese.

1651
01:56:33.04 --> 01:56:35.04
That's why I first heard of origin.

1652
01:56:35.04 --> 01:56:36.04
Yeah.

1653
01:56:36.04 --> 01:56:37.04
The geese.

1654
01:56:37.04 --> 01:56:38.04
Like all these geese are totally protected.

1655
01:56:38.04 --> 01:56:39.04
You know.

1656
01:56:39.04 --> 01:56:43.04
And of course, you know, but that technically is kind of a matter of opinion.

1657
01:56:43.04 --> 01:56:45.04
As far as like, okay, I'm going to look at this geese.

1658
01:56:45.04 --> 01:56:48.04
And be like, okay, no, I'm going to look at someone might like forward more than

1659
01:56:48.04 --> 01:56:49.04
Chevy or whatever.

1660
01:56:49.04 --> 01:56:50.04
Yeah.

1661
01:56:50.04 --> 01:56:54.04
Or the look, especially with the geese, like, you know, the subtle differences.

1662
01:56:54.04 --> 01:56:57.04
Kind of, you know, it's to each their own kind of thing.

1663
01:56:57.04 --> 01:56:58.04
Yeah.

1664
01:56:58.04 --> 01:57:00.04
I guess you're going to like, full on fashion realm.

1665
01:57:00.04 --> 01:57:01.04
Here tends to.

1666
01:57:01.04 --> 01:57:02.04
Which I don't go into.

1667
01:57:02.04 --> 01:57:03.04
I'm looking for functionality.

1668
01:57:03.04 --> 01:57:04.04
You probably could guess that.

1669
01:57:04.04 --> 01:57:05.04
Yes.

1670
01:57:05.04 --> 01:57:07.04
So yeah, and you look into it.

1671
01:57:07.04 --> 01:57:08.04
So the functionality part.

1672
01:57:08.04 --> 01:57:09.04
Yes.

1673
01:57:09.04 --> 01:57:10.04
All that.

1674
01:57:10.04 --> 01:57:11.04
Of course.

1675
01:57:11.04 --> 01:57:16.04
But when you see made in America, this is like the epitome.

1676
01:57:16.04 --> 01:57:19.04
This is the that basically the defining situation.

1677
01:57:19.04 --> 01:57:25.04
So, you know, you know, have to be like, hey, made in America, but then, you know,

1678
01:57:25.04 --> 01:57:26.04
it's closer or whatever.

1679
01:57:26.04 --> 01:57:27.04
Same in the case closed.

1680
01:57:27.04 --> 01:57:29.04
But then you say, okay, dang those are good shirts.

1681
01:57:29.04 --> 01:57:32.04
You know, where do you get your blanks from or whatever.

1682
01:57:32.04 --> 01:57:36.04
Now, oh, we get them from, you know, somewhere other than America kind of thing.

1683
01:57:36.04 --> 01:57:37.04
No, the cotton.

1684
01:57:37.04 --> 01:57:39.04
Get the cotton from America.

1685
01:57:39.04 --> 01:57:40.04
That's what origin did.

1686
01:57:40.04 --> 01:57:42.04
That actual cotton.

1687
01:57:42.04 --> 01:57:43.04
Yeah.

1688
01:57:43.04 --> 01:57:46.04
Well, I mean, I mean, you talk about functionality, just kind of FYI.

1689
01:57:46.04 --> 01:57:47.04
Yeah.

1690
01:57:47.04 --> 01:57:53.04
Uh, when you have a guy that's making the geese and therefore it's going to weave the material to make the geese with.

1691
01:57:53.04 --> 01:58:00.04
He's going to make material that is specifically the best to have for a geat.

1692
01:58:00.04 --> 01:58:01.04
Right.

1693
01:58:01.04 --> 01:58:02.04
And you're going to waste with origin.

1694
01:58:02.04 --> 01:58:05.04
That type of commitment.

1695
01:58:05.04 --> 01:58:06.04
Yes.

1696
01:58:06.04 --> 01:58:08.04
That's why we're a league with origin.

1697
01:58:08.04 --> 01:58:10.04
Yeah, totally makes sense.

1698
01:58:10.04 --> 01:58:13.04
You can kind of, we have that mindset over on this side.

1699
01:58:13.04 --> 01:58:14.04
It makes sense.

1700
01:58:14.04 --> 01:58:20.04
Well, so yeah, origin that that's the one I'm looking forward to my geat.

1701
01:58:20.04 --> 01:58:23.04
And I'm down for geese by the way.

1702
01:58:23.04 --> 01:58:26.04
But yeah, so I'm looking forward to that one.

1703
01:58:26.04 --> 01:58:31.04
Origin main, OR IG, I am an I and E.

1704
01:58:31.04 --> 01:58:33.04
Just to be clear just in case.

1705
01:58:33.04 --> 01:58:34.04
And it's not just geese.

1706
01:58:34.04 --> 01:58:34.04
Yeah.

1707
01:58:34.04 --> 01:58:36.04
You can get the hash guards.

1708
01:58:36.04 --> 01:58:37.04
That's glad.

1709
01:58:37.04 --> 01:58:38.04
Yeah.

1710
01:58:38.04 --> 01:58:40.04
And we're going to be making everything there.

1711
01:58:40.04 --> 01:58:41.04
Yeah.

1712
01:58:41.04 --> 01:58:42.04
We're going to make everything there.

1713
01:58:42.04 --> 01:58:44.04
Everything that I utilize in my life.

1714
01:58:44.04 --> 01:58:45.04
Yeah.

1715
01:58:45.04 --> 01:58:47.04
I'm going to make it.

1716
01:58:47.04 --> 01:58:50.04
It's like the, you're going to kind of come out with almost like a life kit.

1717
01:58:50.04 --> 01:58:52.04
It's really what it is to get.

1718
01:58:52.04 --> 01:58:54.04
Don't use the re-box terminology, bro.

1719
01:58:54.04 --> 01:58:55.04
That's re-box.

1720
01:58:55.04 --> 01:58:58.04
Yeah, because the re-box calls it like the UFC fight kit.

1721
01:58:58.04 --> 01:58:59.04
Ah, okay.

1722
01:58:59.04 --> 01:59:01.04
But I didn't know that.

1723
01:59:01.04 --> 01:59:02.04
Man, not not a kit.

1724
01:59:02.04 --> 01:59:04.04
The word kit is universal.

1725
01:59:04.04 --> 01:59:05.04
No, the word kit is universal word.

1726
01:59:05.04 --> 01:59:06.04
Which I do concur with.

1727
01:59:06.04 --> 01:59:07.04
Right.

1728
01:59:07.04 --> 01:59:08.04
But what did you call it?

1729
01:59:08.04 --> 01:59:09.04
The kit.

1730
01:59:09.04 --> 01:59:10.04
That's what I called it.

1731
01:59:10.04 --> 01:59:11.04
I guess so.

1732
01:59:11.04 --> 01:59:13.04
So you could call it the brits call it kit.

1733
01:59:13.04 --> 01:59:15.04
They call their op gear.

1734
01:59:15.04 --> 01:59:16.04
Like their web gear.

1735
01:59:16.04 --> 01:59:16.04
Yeah.

1736
01:59:16.04 --> 01:59:17.04
They call it kit.

1737
01:59:17.04 --> 01:59:18.04
Yeah.

1738
01:59:18.04 --> 01:59:22.04
Which means that we also, because we have interoperability with the brits and with the

1739
01:59:22.04 --> 01:59:23.04
Aussies.

1740
01:59:23.04 --> 01:59:24.04
Sure.

1741
01:59:24.04 --> 01:59:27.04
And also, tend to call our gear kit.

1742
01:59:27.04 --> 01:59:29.04
So yes, in fact, you are correct.

1743
01:59:29.04 --> 01:59:33.04
If you were to say, I'm going to make all my kit there.

1744
01:59:33.04 --> 01:59:34.04
Right.

1745
01:59:34.04 --> 01:59:35.04
The answer is yes.

1746
01:59:35.04 --> 01:59:46.04
But there's a fine line where people might think of the UFC fight kit, which didn't go over real well when they first came out.

1747
01:59:46.04 --> 01:59:49.04
Yeah, hey, and you know what we're going to let that be there thing?

1748
01:59:49.04 --> 01:59:50.04
For sure.

1749
01:59:50.04 --> 01:59:54.04
Is it going well or not going well? This one, what would it be?

1750
01:59:54.04 --> 01:59:58.04
Like kind of like the diss unofficial discipline equals freedom kit.

1751
01:59:58.04 --> 02:00:00.04
How about we just call it gear?

1752
02:00:00.04 --> 02:00:02.04
Yeah, we could just call it gear, I guess.

1753
02:00:02.04 --> 02:00:04.04
That's my vote.

1754
02:00:04.04 --> 02:00:04.04
All right.

1755
02:00:04.04 --> 02:00:06.04
I don't rule the world.

1756
02:00:06.04 --> 02:00:09.04
So if you want to call it kit on your side and I'll call it gear over here.

1757
02:00:09.04 --> 02:00:09.04
Yeah.

1758
02:00:09.04 --> 02:00:10.04
Let's do that.

1759
02:00:10.04 --> 02:00:11.04
You know, that way you're comfortable.

1760
02:00:11.04 --> 02:00:11.04
Yeah.

1761
02:00:11.04 --> 02:00:14.04
I'm all about everyone being comfortable with what they're saying.

1762
02:00:14.04 --> 02:00:16.04
Technically, it'll be a kit with gear in it.

1763
02:00:16.04 --> 02:00:17.04
Okay.

1764
02:00:17.04 --> 02:00:21.04
Okay.

1765
02:00:21.04 --> 02:00:22.04
Right.

1766
02:00:22.04 --> 02:00:23.04
Okay.

1767
02:00:23.04 --> 02:00:24.04
You got like survival kit.

1768
02:00:24.04 --> 02:00:25.04
Yeah.

1769
02:00:25.04 --> 02:00:29.04
I got a survival kit when I was six years old and it's got a compass in a whistle and a pair of matches in it.

1770
02:00:29.04 --> 02:00:31.04
What happens if you use both matches?

1771
02:00:31.04 --> 02:00:32.04
You're in trouble.

1772
02:00:32.04 --> 02:00:34.04
So that's a survival kit.

1773
02:00:34.04 --> 02:00:36.04
Why do you have a whistle?

1774
02:00:36.04 --> 02:00:37.04
You just said whistle.

1775
02:00:37.04 --> 02:00:38.04
Yeah.

1776
02:00:38.04 --> 02:00:38.04
Yeah.

1777
02:00:38.04 --> 02:00:42.04
But you know when you're a little kid you get lost in the woods, would you suppose to blow on the whistle for a while?

1778
02:00:42.04 --> 02:00:43.04
No.

1779
02:00:43.04 --> 02:00:44.04
No.

1780
02:00:44.04 --> 02:00:45.04
Sorry.

1781
02:00:45.04 --> 02:00:47.04
I didn't go on.

1782
02:00:47.04 --> 02:00:49.04
Why did you do it in Kauai when you got lost?

1783
02:00:49.04 --> 02:00:52.04
You just keep hitting in one direction and bring each other.

1784
02:00:52.04 --> 02:00:53.04
Yeah.

1785
02:00:53.04 --> 02:00:54.04
Or up in the mountains.

1786
02:00:54.04 --> 02:00:56.04
So it's kind of they call it Malka and Maka.

1787
02:00:56.04 --> 02:00:57.04
Malka is mountain.

1788
02:00:57.04 --> 02:00:59.04
So that's kind of the directions.

1789
02:00:59.04 --> 02:01:00.04
Yeah.

1790
02:01:00.04 --> 02:01:02.04
So otherwise you just keep walking.

1791
02:01:02.04 --> 02:01:04.04
That's a good lesson for life too.

1792
02:01:04.04 --> 02:01:06.04
But we're all in the mountains one time.

1793
02:01:06.04 --> 02:01:07.04
Long story.

1794
02:01:07.04 --> 02:01:08.04
Maybe some other time.

1795
02:01:08.04 --> 02:01:09.04
Back to origin.

1796
02:01:09.04 --> 02:01:10.04
Please another time.

1797
02:01:10.04 --> 02:01:12.04
So boom.

1798
02:01:12.04 --> 02:01:13.04
Origin main.

1799
02:01:13.04 --> 02:01:15.04
All made in America.

1800
02:01:15.04 --> 02:01:17.04
Rash guards.

1801
02:01:17.04 --> 02:01:18.04
Gees.

1802
02:01:18.04 --> 02:01:21.04
All like it's just like yeah.

1803
02:01:21.04 --> 02:01:23.04
And by the way, the supplements there too.

1804
02:01:23.04 --> 02:01:24.04
Yeah.

1805
02:01:24.04 --> 02:01:25.04
Supplements.

1806
02:01:25.04 --> 02:01:26.04
Origin labs.

1807
02:01:26.04 --> 02:01:27.04
Yeah.

1808
02:01:27.04 --> 02:01:28.04
So you can find it all there.

1809
02:01:28.04 --> 02:01:29.04
Yeah.

1810
02:01:29.04 --> 02:01:30.04
It's dope.

1811
02:01:30.04 --> 02:01:34.04
And we are going to make basically what we're talking about here.

1812
02:01:34.04 --> 02:01:35.04
Jocquist supplements.

1813
02:01:35.04 --> 02:01:38.04
Because again, one of I specifically want.

1814
02:01:38.04 --> 02:01:39.04
I'm pretty particular.

1815
02:01:39.04 --> 02:01:40.04
Let's make that thing.

1816
02:01:40.04 --> 02:01:41.04
Yeah.

1817
02:01:41.04 --> 02:01:42.04
And then we go forward.

1818
02:01:42.04 --> 02:01:46.04
The good part about that is to is you're kind of one of these guys you can rest assured.

1819
02:01:46.04 --> 02:01:50.04
You're not going to have like this these weird extra things like I don't know.

1820
02:01:50.04 --> 02:01:52.04
You know, hair dye or something like that.

1821
02:01:52.04 --> 02:01:54.04
Or will not be selling a hair dye.

1822
02:01:54.04 --> 02:01:55.04
Yeah.

1823
02:01:55.04 --> 02:01:56.04
Or something like this.

1824
02:01:56.04 --> 02:01:57.04
So yeah.

1825
02:01:57.04 --> 02:01:58.04
That would be good.

1826
02:01:58.04 --> 02:01:59.04
The good stuff for sure.

1827
02:01:59.04 --> 02:02:00.04
Or domain.com.

1828
02:02:00.04 --> 02:02:01.04
Yes.

1829
02:02:01.04 --> 02:02:02.04
Also.

1830
02:02:02.04 --> 02:02:03.04
Support yourself.

1831
02:02:03.04 --> 02:02:04.04
So on it.

1832
02:02:04.04 --> 02:02:07.04
I'm not going to go into my kettlebell situation again.

1833
02:02:07.04 --> 02:02:08.04
It's time.

1834
02:02:08.04 --> 02:02:10.04
Actually yesterday I worked that I didn't do kettlebell.

1835
02:02:10.04 --> 02:02:11.04
I did.

1836
02:02:11.04 --> 02:02:12.04
I just waited for you.

1837
02:02:12.04 --> 02:02:19.04
That was it was like an article that said that those little gobs were not bill big.

1838
02:02:19.04 --> 02:02:20.04
Yeah.

1839
02:02:20.04 --> 02:02:22.04
And that was a funny article for sure.

1840
02:02:22.04 --> 02:02:23.04
I don't know.

1841
02:02:23.04 --> 02:02:26.04
You know what the title was called something along the lines of.

1842
02:02:26.04 --> 02:02:28.04
I'm trying to make remember it exact.

1843
02:02:28.04 --> 02:02:31.04
It's it was called 14 ways to avoid being bigger.

1844
02:02:31.04 --> 02:02:36.04
No, to remain a puny little weakling actually puny.

1845
02:02:36.04 --> 02:02:39.04
I think no, do we do we do we do we do.

1846
02:02:39.04 --> 02:02:40.04
Yeah.

1847
02:02:40.04 --> 02:02:44.04
So apparently given number whatever number that was I'm going to remain a puny little

1848
02:02:44.04 --> 02:02:50.04
doeep apparently here's the thing are those really goblet squats though because goblet squats.

1849
02:02:50.04 --> 02:02:51.04
No, I know what you do.

1850
02:02:51.04 --> 02:02:53.04
You basically do a front shot.

1851
02:02:53.04 --> 02:02:54.04
Yeah.

1852
02:02:54.04 --> 02:02:57.04
Double rack double rack yeah because goblet is like because this is the form of the shape of the

1853
02:02:57.04 --> 02:02:58.04
goblet.

1854
02:02:58.04 --> 02:02:59.04
Yeah.

1855
02:02:59.04 --> 02:03:00.04
That's how you hold it.

1856
02:03:00.04 --> 02:03:01.04
Yeah.

1857
02:03:01.04 --> 02:03:02.04
It is kind of I mean.

1858
02:03:02.04 --> 02:03:03.04
But what if you use like a huge as kettlebell.

1859
02:03:03.04 --> 02:03:04.04
Part of a metcon.

1860
02:03:04.04 --> 02:03:05.04
Yeah.

1861
02:03:05.04 --> 02:03:06.04
That could work.

1862
02:03:06.04 --> 02:03:07.04
In fact.

1863
02:03:07.04 --> 02:03:10.04
But it would ever but it was a real subjective really.

1864
02:03:10.04 --> 02:03:11.04
Yeah.

1865
02:03:11.04 --> 02:03:13.04
I think it was more of a shock article kind of.

1866
02:03:13.04 --> 02:03:14.04
Yeah.

1867
02:03:14.04 --> 02:03:15.04
It was just feel the laugh.

1868
02:03:15.04 --> 02:03:16.04
Yeah.

1869
02:03:16.04 --> 02:03:17.04
But if you take that.

1870
02:03:17.04 --> 02:03:21.04
I don't think it was a serious directive out there trying to help people that have skinny

1871
02:03:21.04 --> 02:03:22.04
knees.

1872
02:03:22.04 --> 02:03:27.04
Spread of them.

1873
02:03:27.04 --> 02:03:28.04
Maybe.

1874
02:03:28.04 --> 02:03:29.04
See real proud of that.

1875
02:03:29.04 --> 02:03:30.04
Look at you.

1876
02:03:30.04 --> 02:03:32.04
Anyway.

1877
02:03:32.04 --> 02:03:35.04
I didn't really like the article on that level.

1878
02:03:35.04 --> 02:03:36.04
But for a laugh it was good.

1879
02:03:36.04 --> 02:03:38.04
And and factually here's the deal.

1880
02:03:38.04 --> 02:03:39.04
Candle bells are legit.

1881
02:03:39.04 --> 02:03:40.04
Yeah.

1882
02:03:40.04 --> 02:03:41.04
And they are.

1883
02:03:41.04 --> 02:03:42.04
Goblet squats are legit.

1884
02:03:42.04 --> 02:03:43.04
But here's the thing.

1885
02:03:43.04 --> 02:03:44.04
There was a good point.

1886
02:03:44.04 --> 02:03:45.04
Hey.

1887
02:03:45.04 --> 02:03:46.04
Yeah.

1888
02:03:46.04 --> 02:03:47.04
I'll tell you what.

1889
02:03:47.04 --> 02:03:50.04
You know where you're talking about what you what you you used to.

1890
02:03:50.04 --> 02:03:51.04
You're good.

1891
02:03:51.04 --> 02:03:52.04
Yeah.

1892
02:03:52.04 --> 02:03:56.04
For some reason I hurt like my wrist or something or I hurt something.

1893
02:03:56.04 --> 02:03:58.04
And I couldn't do.

1894
02:03:58.04 --> 02:03:59.04
Back squats or front squats.

1895
02:03:59.04 --> 02:04:00.04
Oh yeah.

1896
02:04:00.04 --> 02:04:01.04
So I was.

1897
02:04:01.04 --> 02:04:02.04
Yeah.

1898
02:04:02.04 --> 02:04:03.04
It was maybe it was my shoulder.

1899
02:04:03.04 --> 02:04:04.04
Anyways.

1900
02:04:04.04 --> 02:04:05.04
I was doing goblet squats with the.

1901
02:04:05.04 --> 02:04:09.04
With my big kettlebell, which is 40 kilograms.

1902
02:04:09.04 --> 02:04:15.04
And I I had put on the schedule of what I was going to do like 25.

1903
02:04:15.04 --> 02:04:17.04
It was a bunch of it was a metcon scenario.

1904
02:04:17.04 --> 02:04:18.04
I was innocent.

1905
02:04:18.04 --> 02:04:20.04
But the first number was 25.

1906
02:04:20.04 --> 02:04:21.04
It was 25.

1907
02:04:21.04 --> 02:04:22.04
25.

1908
02:04:22.04 --> 02:04:23.04
Oh the reps.

1909
02:04:23.04 --> 02:04:24.04
Yeah.

1910
02:04:24.04 --> 02:04:25.04
Yeah.

1911
02:04:25.04 --> 02:04:26.04
25 hurt.

1912
02:04:26.04 --> 02:04:26.04
Yeah.

1913
02:04:26.04 --> 02:04:27.04
I was.

1914
02:04:27.04 --> 02:04:28.04
Dang.

1915
02:04:28.04 --> 02:04:29.04
Because it's only.

1916
02:04:29.04 --> 02:04:30.04
It's only 88 pounds.

1917
02:04:30.04 --> 02:04:31.04
Right.

1918
02:04:31.04 --> 02:04:32.04
That should be.

1919
02:04:32.04 --> 02:04:33.04
That should be pretty insignificant.

1920
02:04:33.04 --> 02:04:34.04
Yeah.

1921
02:04:34.04 --> 02:04:35.04
Because goblet squats.

1922
02:04:35.04 --> 02:04:36.04
Yeah.

1923
02:04:36.04 --> 02:04:38.04
You're using your whole body to keep that thing in mind.

1924
02:04:38.04 --> 02:04:39.04
Yeah.

1925
02:04:39.04 --> 02:04:40.04
Yeah.

1926
02:04:40.04 --> 02:04:41.04
It's good.

1927
02:04:41.04 --> 02:04:42.04
I think my.

1928
02:04:42.04 --> 02:04:43.04
Yeah.

1929
02:04:43.04 --> 02:04:44.04
Yeah.

1930
02:04:44.04 --> 02:04:45.04
I think I'm used to it.

1931
02:04:45.04 --> 02:04:46.04
I think that.

1932
02:04:46.04 --> 02:04:47.04
Yeah.

1933
02:04:47.04 --> 02:04:48.04
And I got used to it.

1934
02:04:48.04 --> 02:04:49.04
And it was pretty short period of time.

1935
02:04:49.04 --> 02:04:50.04
Yeah.

1936
02:04:50.04 --> 02:04:51.04
Yeah.

1937
02:04:51.04 --> 02:04:52.04
So on it.com.

1938
02:04:52.04 --> 02:04:54.04
You can get that kind of stuff there.

1939
02:04:54.04 --> 02:04:55.04
If you want the cool ones.

1940
02:04:55.04 --> 02:04:56.04
I think.

1941
02:04:56.04 --> 02:04:57.04
And I don't know.

1942
02:04:57.04 --> 02:04:59.04
Cause then you know I haven't ventured out.

1943
02:04:59.04 --> 02:05:01.04
And I don't think I ever will ventured out.

1944
02:05:01.04 --> 02:05:04.04
I can get other kettlebells from no need really.

1945
02:05:04.04 --> 02:05:08.04
Cause you can buy the regular ones or the the adult ones.

1946
02:05:08.04 --> 02:05:09.04
And let's face it man.

1947
02:05:09.04 --> 02:05:12.04
You take enough pictures of the adult ones for your Instagram.

1948
02:05:12.04 --> 02:05:14.04
Wherever you take pictures for.

1949
02:05:14.04 --> 02:05:16.04
And you kind of can't go back.

1950
02:05:16.04 --> 02:05:17.04
You can't.

1951
02:05:17.04 --> 02:05:18.04
Hmm.

1952
02:05:18.04 --> 02:05:19.04
So keep that in mind.

1953
02:05:19.04 --> 02:05:20.04
Find it yourself into a kettlebell corner.

1954
02:05:20.04 --> 02:05:21.04
Yeah.

1955
02:05:21.04 --> 02:05:22.04
Exactly.

1956
02:05:22.04 --> 02:05:23.04
Right.

1957
02:05:23.04 --> 02:05:24.04
And you and your social media.

1958
02:05:24.04 --> 02:05:25.04
Yeah.

1959
02:05:25.04 --> 02:05:27.04
Have painted yourself into this.

1960
02:05:27.04 --> 02:05:28.04
Yes.

1961
02:05:28.04 --> 02:05:29.04
Corner.

1962
02:05:29.04 --> 02:05:30.04
Which is not a bad thing.

1963
02:05:30.04 --> 02:05:32.04
On a dot com slash juggle.

1964
02:05:32.04 --> 02:05:33.04
That's where you get these things.

1965
02:05:33.04 --> 02:05:35.04
I painted myself into a corner with my social media.

1966
02:05:35.04 --> 02:05:37.04
I'm going to wake up every day at 430.

1967
02:05:37.04 --> 02:05:38.04
Yeah.

1968
02:05:38.04 --> 02:05:39.04
You got to post it.

1969
02:05:39.04 --> 02:05:40.04
Guess what?

1970
02:05:40.04 --> 02:05:41.04
The other day I got home at 3 o'clock in the morning.

1971
02:05:41.04 --> 02:05:42.04
Or I got I didn't get to sleep until like 130.

1972
02:05:42.04 --> 02:05:43.04
Yeah.

1973
02:05:43.04 --> 02:05:44.04
When I woke up in the morning.

1974
02:05:44.04 --> 02:05:45.04
I was really tired.

1975
02:05:45.04 --> 02:05:46.04
Yeah.

1976
02:05:46.04 --> 02:05:48.04
And I was.

1977
02:05:48.04 --> 02:05:49.04
You know, what am I going to do?

1978
02:05:49.04 --> 02:05:51.04
I'm I'm painting in a corner.

1979
02:05:51.04 --> 02:05:52.04
I had to say hey guys.

1980
02:05:52.04 --> 02:05:54.04
I'm I'm I'm going back to sleep.

1981
02:05:54.04 --> 02:05:55.04
And I actually went back to sleep.

1982
02:05:55.04 --> 02:05:56.04
That's all everyone.

1983
02:05:56.04 --> 02:05:57.04
Yeah.

1984
02:05:57.04 --> 02:05:58.04
See that's good though.

1985
02:05:58.04 --> 02:05:59.04
You took accountability though.

1986
02:05:59.04 --> 02:06:00.04
Yeah.

1987
02:06:00.04 --> 02:06:02.04
I like that's just lying.

1988
02:06:02.04 --> 02:06:03.04
But I don't sport.

1989
02:06:03.04 --> 02:06:05.04
Oh, if you didn't do that.

1990
02:06:05.04 --> 02:06:08.04
If I said, if I woke up took a picture of my watch, which I've had people say,

1991
02:06:08.04 --> 02:06:09.04
like, I bet you just wake up.

1992
02:06:09.04 --> 02:06:11.04
Oh, you ever sometimes just wake up in the morning.

1993
02:06:11.04 --> 02:06:13.04
Take a picture watch and you go back to sleep.

1994
02:06:13.04 --> 02:06:14.04
No, actually.

1995
02:06:14.04 --> 02:06:15.04
I don't do that.

1996
02:06:15.04 --> 02:06:16.04
Yeah.

1997
02:06:16.04 --> 02:06:17.04
It doesn't seem like you could ever bring yourself to do that.

1998
02:06:17.04 --> 02:06:19.04
Well, why would even want it?

1999
02:06:19.04 --> 02:06:20.04
You wouldn't want to do that.

2000
02:06:20.04 --> 02:06:21.04
It's a horrible scenario.

2001
02:06:21.04 --> 02:06:22.04
It kind of defeats the purpose.

2002
02:06:22.04 --> 02:06:23.04
Yeah.

2003
02:06:23.04 --> 02:06:24.04
The whole purpose.

2004
02:06:24.04 --> 02:06:26.04
So the other day woke up.

2005
02:06:26.04 --> 02:06:28.04
Took a picture of my watch.

2006
02:06:28.04 --> 02:06:31.04
And I was like, I got to go back to bed.

2007
02:06:31.04 --> 02:06:32.04
I'm too freaking tired.

2008
02:06:32.04 --> 02:06:33.04
I'm so in fact, a bed.

2009
02:06:33.04 --> 02:06:34.04
But you didn't post it.

2010
02:06:34.04 --> 02:06:35.04
No, no, you posted it.

2011
02:06:35.04 --> 02:06:37.04
But you said I said I said I said I said I said I'm going back to bed.

2012
02:06:37.04 --> 02:06:39.04
I had no, I'm sorry.

2013
02:06:39.04 --> 02:06:41.04
Hold the line for me.

2014
02:06:41.04 --> 02:06:42.04
Yeah, I did your cover for me.

2015
02:06:42.04 --> 02:06:45.04
Actually, that one time we got to cover in snooze.

2016
02:06:45.04 --> 02:06:48.04
Did you guys cover it?

2017
02:06:48.04 --> 02:06:49.04
Get out of here.

2018
02:06:49.04 --> 02:06:50.04
I'm going to be over here snooze.

2019
02:06:50.04 --> 02:06:51.04
Well, hey, that's the freedom part though.

2020
02:06:51.04 --> 02:06:52.04
We'll do something.

2021
02:06:52.04 --> 02:06:53.04
Yeah.

2022
02:06:53.04 --> 02:06:55.04
You have the freedom to even.

2023
02:06:55.04 --> 02:06:56.04
You got to sometimes.

2024
02:06:56.04 --> 02:06:56.04
Yeah.

2025
02:06:56.04 --> 02:07:01.04
But you can't like, well, especially if you're working out and you don't, you straight up don't get enough sleep.

2026
02:07:01.04 --> 02:07:02.04
I'm not saying you don't.

2027
02:07:02.04 --> 02:07:03.04
You don't.

2028
02:07:03.04 --> 02:07:04.04
I don't.

2029
02:07:04.04 --> 02:07:05.04
But that's all what I'm saying, you know.

2030
02:07:05.04 --> 02:07:11.04
But if you, you, the proverbial, you us when we don't get enough recovery.

2031
02:07:11.04 --> 02:07:12.04
Uh-huh.

2032
02:07:12.04 --> 02:07:14.04
Which sleep is recovery.

2033
02:07:14.04 --> 02:07:15.04
Right.

2034
02:07:15.04 --> 02:07:17.04
That's not a good thing, man.

2035
02:07:17.04 --> 02:07:18.04
So everyone's in a while.

2036
02:07:18.04 --> 02:07:25.04
You got to exercise that restraint in the form of the freedom to sleep in.

2037
02:07:25.04 --> 02:07:26.04
Yeah.

2038
02:07:26.04 --> 02:07:27.04
Well, I did.

2039
02:07:27.04 --> 02:07:28.04
Amen.

2040
02:07:28.04 --> 02:07:29.04
That's part of life.

2041
02:07:29.04 --> 02:07:32.04
Anyway, honestly, also the whole painting yourself in the corner case.

2042
02:07:32.04 --> 02:07:36.04
So I got this jump rope and it's like, you know, then I don't know how up to date you

2043
02:07:36.04 --> 02:07:37.04
are on the new jump rope.

2044
02:07:37.04 --> 02:07:38.04
Yeah.

2045
02:07:38.04 --> 02:07:39.04
Yeah.

2046
02:07:39.04 --> 02:07:40.04
They're getting better.

2047
02:07:40.04 --> 02:07:41.04
They're, yeah, they're dope.

2048
02:07:41.04 --> 02:07:42.04
And here's the thing.

2049
02:07:42.04 --> 02:07:46.04
If you just buy a regular jump rope, like you'll see the difference.

2050
02:07:46.04 --> 02:07:49.04
And I mentioned that because I got on it jump rope.

2051
02:07:49.04 --> 02:07:50.04
I told you about the time.

2052
02:07:50.04 --> 02:07:53.04
My neighbor taught me to do the cross over the neighbors.

2053
02:07:53.04 --> 02:07:56.04
And that's when it really hit me like, this is the dope jump rope.

2054
02:07:56.04 --> 02:08:00.04
So if you want to upgrade your jump rope, boom on it, that's the one.

2055
02:08:00.04 --> 02:08:01.04
In fact, just go on there.

2056
02:08:01.04 --> 02:08:02.04
See what up.

2057
02:08:02.04 --> 02:08:03.04
See what they have.

2058
02:08:03.04 --> 02:08:04.04
They have a lot of good stuff.

2059
02:08:04.04 --> 02:08:06.04

Also, jocobottoor.

2087
02:09:03.04 --> 02:09:05.04
It's called jocobottoor.com.

2088
02:09:05.04 --> 02:09:07.04
There are hats there.

2089
02:09:07.04 --> 02:09:08.04
Good hats.

2090
02:09:08.04 --> 02:09:09.04
Chocobotts.

2091
02:09:09.04 --> 02:09:10.04
Flex fit.

2092
02:09:10.04 --> 02:09:11.04
Three colors.

2093
02:09:11.04 --> 02:09:12.04
Wait, flex fit?

2094
02:09:12.04 --> 02:09:13.04
They're flex fit.

2095
02:09:13.04 --> 02:09:16.04
Wait, they don't have the little thing in the back where you...

2096
02:09:16.04 --> 02:09:17.04
Yeah, they snap back.

2097
02:09:17.04 --> 02:09:18.04
Yeah, they snap back.

2098
02:09:18.04 --> 02:09:20.04
No, I think they're flex fit.

2099
02:09:20.04 --> 02:09:22.04
They don't make trucker hats at our flex fit.

2100
02:09:22.04 --> 02:09:24.04
I don't think they do now.

2101
02:09:24.04 --> 02:09:25.04
Oh, okay.

2102
02:09:25.04 --> 02:09:26.04
Pretty sure.

2103
02:09:26.04 --> 02:09:27.04
I'm fairly positive.

2104
02:09:27.04 --> 02:09:28.04
Well, they're hats.

2105
02:09:28.04 --> 02:09:29.04
Yeah.

2106
02:09:29.04 --> 02:09:30.04
And they're dope.

2107
02:09:30.04 --> 02:09:32.04
Yeah, I thought you were going to bring me nine of them.

2108
02:09:32.04 --> 02:09:33.04
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2109
02:09:33.04 --> 02:09:34.04
But you didn't.

2110
02:09:34.04 --> 02:09:34.04
I didn't do that.

2111
02:09:34.04 --> 02:09:35.04
That's a bummer.

2112
02:09:35.04 --> 02:09:36.04
Jocobottoor has a store.

2113
02:09:36.04 --> 02:09:38.04
But Jocobottoor has no hats.

2114
02:09:38.04 --> 02:09:39.04
Yeah.

2115
02:09:39.04 --> 02:09:40.04
There is a...

2116
02:09:40.04 --> 02:09:41.04
You know what?

2117
02:09:41.04 --> 02:09:42.04
There's this other kind of hat.

2118
02:09:42.04 --> 02:09:44.04
I think it's called like an operator hat.

2119
02:09:44.04 --> 02:09:46.04
It's like a real simple.

2120
02:09:46.04 --> 02:09:47.04
Anyway.

2121
02:09:47.04 --> 02:09:49.04
But, you know, doing that one too.

2122
02:09:49.04 --> 02:09:50.04
Interesting.

2123
02:09:50.04 --> 02:09:54.04
In the event of you not being as into the trucker hat is maybe something else.

2124
02:09:54.04 --> 02:09:55.04
We'll see.

2125
02:09:55.04 --> 02:09:57.04
Flex hit as well.

2126
02:09:57.04 --> 02:09:58.04
That's my thing.

2127
02:09:58.04 --> 02:09:59.04
It's flex fit cool.

2128
02:09:59.04 --> 02:10:00.04
Is that good?

2129
02:10:00.04 --> 02:10:01.04
Yeah.

2130
02:10:01.04 --> 02:10:02.04
Flex fit has purpose.

2131
02:10:02.04 --> 02:10:04.04
I just have never seen a trucker's hat flex fit.

2132
02:10:04.04 --> 02:10:05.04
Yeah.

2133
02:10:05.04 --> 02:10:06.04
And I doubt I'm going to see one now.

2134
02:10:06.04 --> 02:10:07.04
No, man.

2135
02:10:07.04 --> 02:10:08.04
It's the new stuff.

2136
02:10:08.04 --> 02:10:09.04
Apparently.

2137
02:10:09.04 --> 02:10:10.04
But yeah, some of the stuff on there.

2138
02:10:10.04 --> 02:10:11.04
I'm sure it's on there.

2139
02:10:11.04 --> 02:10:12.04
Cool stuff.

2140
02:10:12.04 --> 02:10:15.04
Jocobottoor has a shirt that he designed, which is cool layers, if you will.

2141
02:10:15.04 --> 02:10:16.04
Yeah.

2142
02:10:16.04 --> 02:10:17.04
Just cool.

2143
02:10:17.04 --> 02:10:19.04
I like the way you promote the shirt that has your picture on it.

2144
02:10:19.04 --> 02:10:20.04
You're proud of that.

2145
02:10:20.04 --> 02:10:22.04
You know, I'm not actually because I didn't wear that one.

2146
02:10:22.04 --> 02:10:23.04
No, I didn't want.

2147
02:10:23.04 --> 02:10:24.04
I didn't want my picture on there.

2148
02:10:24.04 --> 02:10:25.04
Yeah.

2149
02:10:25.04 --> 02:10:26.04
Actually, that's true.

2150
02:10:26.04 --> 02:10:28.04
I got to give you that echo did not want to have an echo shirt.

2151
02:10:28.04 --> 02:10:29.04
Because it doesn't.

2152
02:10:29.04 --> 02:10:30.04
I did it.

2153
02:10:30.04 --> 02:10:31.04
I did it.

2154
02:10:31.04 --> 02:10:32.04
Yeah.

2155
02:10:32.04 --> 02:10:33.04
VToded.

2156
02:10:33.04 --> 02:10:35.04
This is called Jocobottoor.

2157
02:10:35.04 --> 02:10:37.04
I got some pool.

2158
02:10:37.04 --> 02:10:38.04
Yeah.

2159
02:10:38.04 --> 02:10:39.04
Jocobottoor.

2160
02:10:39.04 --> 02:10:40.04
And I'm not saying to buy this shirt.

2161
02:10:40.04 --> 02:10:41.04
I'm not saying to buy hat.

2162
02:10:41.04 --> 02:10:43.04
I'm saying go on the store.

2163
02:10:43.04 --> 02:10:44.04
Jocobottoor.com again.

2164
02:10:44.04 --> 02:10:48.04
If you like something, get something.

2165
02:10:48.04 --> 02:10:50.04
Good support.

2166
02:10:50.04 --> 02:10:53.04
Also psychological warfare.

2167
02:10:53.04 --> 02:10:55.04
If you don't know what that is.

2168
02:10:55.04 --> 02:10:58.04
It's an album with tracks, jocotracks.

2169
02:10:58.04 --> 02:11:05.04
And these tracks help you get through moments of weakness in your campaign against weakness.

2170
02:11:05.04 --> 02:11:06.04
Everyone's in a while.

2171
02:11:06.04 --> 02:11:13.04
When you wage these hard campaigns against weakness against your, you know, waking up early,

2172
02:11:13.04 --> 02:11:16.04
sticking to the diet, work out all this stuff.

2173
02:11:16.04 --> 02:11:19.04
Sometimes you get moments of fatigue.

2174
02:11:19.04 --> 02:11:23.04
Sometimes even the strongest have their moments of fatigue.

2175
02:11:23.04 --> 02:11:24.04
That's affirmative.

2176
02:11:24.04 --> 02:11:26.04
So this psychological warfare.

2177
02:11:26.04 --> 02:11:30.04
These tracks, they're like little spots for those moments of fatigue get you through it.

2178
02:11:30.04 --> 02:11:32.04
No problem psychologically.

2179
02:11:32.04 --> 02:11:33.04
Then you act.

2180
02:11:33.04 --> 02:11:34.04
Boom.

2181
02:11:34.04 --> 02:11:35.04
So yeah, that's a good one.

2182
02:11:35.04 --> 02:11:37.04
So if you're waking up early, like I said, you're waking up early.

2183
02:11:37.04 --> 02:11:39.04
You feel like even the snooze.

2184
02:11:39.04 --> 02:11:40.04
Listen to psychological warfare.

2186
02:11:41.04 --> 02:11:44.04
I think it's called get up and get after it.

2187
02:11:44.04 --> 02:11:45.04
You will not hit the snooze.

2188
02:11:45.04 --> 02:11:46.04

I wanted since I was an E4 in the Navy that wanted to know what happened.

02:12:29.04 --> 02:12:31.04
And those some crazy details, by the way.

2211
02:12:31.04 --> 02:12:32.04
Yeah.

2212
02:12:32.04 --> 02:12:33.04
Yeah.

2213
02:12:33.04 --> 02:12:34.04
It's crazy.

2214
02:12:34.04 --> 02:12:37.04
He's he's he's he's talking about how.

2215
02:12:37.04 --> 02:12:39.04
Yeah.

2216
02:12:39.04 --> 02:12:42.04
You know, my friend gets his like forehead blown off or whatever.

2217
02:12:42.04 --> 02:12:45.04
You can see his brain all this stuff.

2218
02:12:45.04 --> 02:12:47.04
Even in a movie that that'd be pretty graphic.

2219
02:12:47.04 --> 02:12:49.04
Even in a movie that'd be unbelievable.

2220
02:12:49.04 --> 02:12:50.04
Yeah.

2221
02:12:50.04 --> 02:12:51.04
Like he back all.

2222
02:12:51.04 --> 02:12:54.04
That movie wasn't really realistic because the guy out of his head blown off.

2223
02:12:54.04 --> 02:12:55.04
And then he lived.

2224
02:12:55.04 --> 02:12:56.04
But that was a crazy part though, right?

2225
02:12:56.04 --> 02:12:57.04
On that movie.

2226
02:12:57.04 --> 02:12:58.04
Yeah.

2227
02:12:58.04 --> 02:12:59.04
You know, but yeah, well, it really happened.

2228
02:12:59.04 --> 02:13:00.04
Oh, so he's, you know, he has him.

2229
02:13:00.04 --> 02:13:02.04
He's all the guy he shot by the way.

2230
02:13:02.04 --> 02:13:05.04
And his like, and he's going, you know, through the ocean all this stuff.

2231
02:13:05.04 --> 02:13:08.04
And then he's going to be like, I can't even trap him on his back from.

2232
02:13:08.04 --> 02:13:10.04
Yeah.

2233
02:13:10.04 --> 02:13:11.04
Yeah.

2234
02:13:11.04 --> 02:13:13.04
That he threw back five times.

2235
02:13:13.04 --> 02:13:13.04
Yeah.

2236
02:13:13.04 --> 02:13:14.04
No.

2237
02:13:14.04 --> 02:13:15.04
It's so crazy.

2238
02:13:15.04 --> 02:13:16.04
Yeah.

2239
02:13:16.04 --> 02:13:18.04
And then we're sitting here and he's sitting right there.

2240
02:13:18.04 --> 02:13:21.04
That's the guy who really did that, you know, he's not.

2241
02:13:21.04 --> 02:13:22.04
I mean, resuff course acting is cool and don't furl, but that's not an act.

2242
02:13:22.04 --> 02:13:24.04
That's the guy who really did it.

2243
02:13:24.04 --> 02:13:26.04
Heavy, but that's heavy.

2244
02:13:26.04 --> 02:13:27.04
Yeah.

2245
02:13:27.04 --> 02:13:29.04
It's crazy.

2246
02:13:29.04 --> 02:13:34.04
So get the book read about it, read the rest of the details that we barely even scratch

2247
02:13:34.04 --> 02:13:35.04
on.

2248
02:13:35.04 --> 02:13:37.04
Also, some other books you can get.

2249
02:13:37.04 --> 02:13:39.04
You can book all the extreme ownership.

2250
02:13:39.04 --> 02:13:40.04
It's about leadership.

2251
02:13:40.04 --> 02:13:42.04
Yeah.

2252
02:13:42.04 --> 02:13:44.04
It teaches you how to lead.

2253
02:13:44.04 --> 02:13:45.04
Sure.

2254
02:13:45.04 --> 02:13:48.04
It's a book that I wish I had when I was a young leader.

2255
02:13:48.04 --> 02:13:50.04
But I didn't have it.

2256
02:13:50.04 --> 02:13:53.04
I wasn't old enough to have written it and given it back to myself yet.

2257
02:13:53.04 --> 02:13:54.04
Yeah.

2258
02:13:54.04 --> 02:13:56.04
It doesn't work like that.

2259
02:13:56.04 --> 02:13:59.04
Also, what's speaking of being young, you can another book called The Way of the War

2260
02:13:59.04 --> 02:14:03.04
Your Kid, which is awesome because kids all over the place.

2261
02:14:03.04 --> 02:14:07.04
Like parents now when I'm speaking somewhere, they bring their kids.

2262
02:14:07.04 --> 02:14:08.04
Yeah.

2263
02:14:08.04 --> 02:14:09.04
So I get to meet these kids.

2264
02:14:09.04 --> 02:14:13.04
Kids that are getting their after it, which is pretty awesome.

2265
02:14:13.04 --> 02:14:18.04
So way the warrior kid, so many kids are like doing pull ups now.

2266
02:14:18.04 --> 02:14:19.04
Yeah.

2267
02:14:19.04 --> 02:14:21.04
So I was just going to say my daughter would be like,

2268
02:14:21.04 --> 02:14:25.04
bothering me dead that I want to do pull ups.

2269
02:14:25.04 --> 02:14:27.04
She doesn't want to go.

2270
02:14:27.04 --> 02:14:30.04
She'll get that from reading Cinderella.

2271
02:14:30.04 --> 02:14:32.04
Cinderella did not make her want to do that, right?

2272
02:14:32.04 --> 02:14:36.04
I did tell her the story since the last night coincidentally.

2273
02:14:36.04 --> 02:14:38.04
She wouldn't want to do it any pull ups about it though.

2274
02:14:38.04 --> 02:14:40.04
No, I didn't come tell her to go do anything.

2275
02:14:40.04 --> 02:14:44.04
Did it come tell her to study hard?

2276
02:14:44.04 --> 02:14:46.04
No, she just said it was beautiful.

2277
02:14:46.04 --> 02:14:47.04
Okay.

2278
02:14:47.04 --> 02:14:49.04
So it compelled some thoughts of beauty.

2279
02:14:49.04 --> 02:14:50.04
Yeah.

2280
02:14:50.04 --> 02:14:53.04
But it didn't come tell any change of direction in life.

2281
02:14:53.04 --> 02:14:54.04
No, action taken.

2282
02:14:54.04 --> 02:14:56.04
I'm going with way the warrior kid.

2283
02:14:56.04 --> 02:14:57.04
Yeah, I meet you.

2284
02:14:57.04 --> 02:15:01.04
Also, this money goes for you freedom field manual.

2285
02:15:01.04 --> 02:15:04.04
It's coming out.

2286
02:15:04.04 --> 02:15:07.04
That could compel you to get after it.

2287
02:15:07.04 --> 02:15:08.04
Yeah.

2288
02:15:08.04 --> 02:15:09.04
It could.

2289
02:15:09.04 --> 02:15:10.04
I'd check it out.

2290
02:15:10.04 --> 02:15:11.04
There's no books like it.

2291
02:15:11.04 --> 02:15:12.04
Yeah.

2292
02:15:12.04 --> 02:15:14.04
And it's like, it's a manual.

2293
02:15:14.04 --> 02:15:15.04
That's a manual.

2294
02:15:15.04 --> 02:15:16.04
It's a manual.

2295
02:15:16.04 --> 02:15:16.04
Yeah.

2296
02:15:16.04 --> 02:15:18.04
You know how like when you listen, you're like, okay,

2297
02:15:18.04 --> 02:15:22.04
you know, you kind of get a feel, but there's nothing in your heart

2298
02:15:22.04 --> 02:15:22.04
of it.

2299
02:15:22.04 --> 02:15:23.04
There's nothing I had about the manual.

2300
02:15:23.04 --> 02:15:25.04
It tells you what to do.

2301
02:15:25.04 --> 02:15:25.04
Yeah.

2302
02:15:25.04 --> 02:15:27.04
And it also talks about some thoughts.

2303
02:15:27.04 --> 02:15:29.04
Better in my head.

2304
02:15:29.04 --> 02:15:32.04
So it is interesting.

2305
02:15:32.04 --> 02:15:34.04
You can get it.

2306
02:15:34.04 --> 02:15:36.04
I appreciate it.

2307
02:15:36.04 --> 02:15:38.04
Also, origin main.

2308
02:15:38.04 --> 02:15:40.04
You already covered that, which is good.

2309
02:15:40.04 --> 02:15:41.04
Mm.

2310
02:15:41.04 --> 02:15:43.04
That is now us, by the way.

2311
02:15:43.04 --> 02:15:44.04
We're partnered.

2312
02:15:44.04 --> 02:15:49.04

02:15:50.04 --> 02:15:51.04
Coming get it.

2315
02:15:51.04 --> 02:15:54.04
If you're on the path of getting after it,

2316
02:15:54.04 --> 02:15:57.04
do it with us at origin.

2317
02:15:57.04 --> 02:16:02.04
And also, if you want to partner with us from a leadership perspective

2318
02:16:02.04 --> 02:16:04.04
in your business, our business,

2319
02:16:04.04 --> 02:16:07.04
echelon front leadership consulting,

2320
02:16:07.04 --> 02:16:09.04
that's what we do.

2321
02:16:09.04 --> 02:16:11.04
Me, Lave Babin, J.P.

2322
02:16:11.04 --> 02:16:15.04
to know Dave Burke, info at echelonfront.com.

2323
02:16:15.04 --> 02:16:20.04
Don't Google and look for Jocco speaking,

2324
02:16:20.04 --> 02:16:23.04
because that's going to give you a speakers agent.

2325
02:16:23.04 --> 02:16:25.04
That's going to charge you more money.

2326
02:16:25.04 --> 02:16:29.04
Is there something going to be like a bureau or a speaker's bureau speakers agent?

2327
02:16:29.04 --> 02:16:30.04
That's okay.

2328
02:16:30.04 --> 02:16:32.04
And they're trying to provide a service.

2329
02:16:32.04 --> 02:16:38.04
They're trying to get, they're trying to connect speakers with people that need speakers.

2330
02:16:38.04 --> 02:16:41.04
But we don't need anyone to connect us with people that need speakers.

2331
02:16:41.04 --> 02:16:44.04
You can go straight to echelonfront.com.

2332
02:16:44.04 --> 02:16:46.04
So that's that.

2333
02:16:46.04 --> 02:16:51.04
Also, the master September 14th and 15th in San Diego.

2334
02:16:51.04 --> 02:16:54.04
Just to clarify, the first three monsters were based on the same

2335
02:16:54.04 --> 02:16:58.04
material, because we did it on the west, on the east,

2336
02:16:58.04 --> 02:17:01.04
and then in the center of the country.

2337
02:17:01.04 --> 02:17:04.04
Just to clarify, now that this monster,

2338
02:17:04.04 --> 02:17:07.04
Master 4, is a new material.

2339
02:17:07.04 --> 02:17:09.04
So it's different.

2340
02:17:09.04 --> 02:17:12.04
New approaches, new stories.

2341
02:17:12.04 --> 02:17:15.04
It's not sold out yet, but it will be.

2342
02:17:15.04 --> 02:17:17.04
So if you want to come, register now,

And while you're waiting for the monster,

2345
02:17:23.04 --> 02:17:28.04
if you have a question for us,

2346
02:17:28.04 --> 02:17:33.04
you can ask that question on the interwebs.

2347
02:17:33.04 --> 02:17:38.04
Where there, on the Twitter, the Instagram,

2348
02:17:38.04 --> 02:17:41.04
and that's Facebook.

2349
02:17:41.04 --> 02:17:46.04
Echo is at echelonfronts, and I am at Jockel-Willink,

2350
02:17:46.04 --> 02:17:48.04
also Snapchat.

2351
02:17:48.04 --> 02:17:49.04
Are you on there?

2352
02:17:49.04 --> 02:17:52.04
I am on there, and I posted a snap.

2353
02:17:52.04 --> 02:17:54.04
So far, one snap.

2354
02:17:54.04 --> 02:17:56.04
And it disappears after 24 hours.

2355
02:17:56.04 --> 02:17:57.04
Yes, so you can't go.

2356
02:17:57.04 --> 02:17:59.04
And I'm still working to figure out,

2357
02:17:59.04 --> 02:18:01.04
like, how I'm supposed to utilize this thing.

2358
02:18:01.04 --> 02:18:02.04
Yeah.

2359
02:18:02.04 --> 02:18:04.04
So we'll continue working on that one.

2360
02:18:04.04 --> 02:18:05.04
Yeah.

2361
02:18:05.04 --> 02:18:09.04
And that's it.

2362
02:18:09.04 --> 02:18:12.04
That's how you can get in touch with us.

2363
02:18:12.04 --> 02:18:15.04
And finally,

2364
02:18:15.04 --> 02:18:24.04
I'm going to ask you,

2365
02:18:24.04 --> 02:18:27.04
if you want to go on,

2366
02:18:27.04 --> 02:18:30.04
you can't go on anymore.

2367
02:18:30.04 --> 02:18:33.04
Think about Mike Thorden.

2368
02:18:33.04 --> 02:18:35.04
And remember,

2369
02:18:35.04 --> 02:18:44.04
that you are capable of so much more

2370
02:18:44.04 --> 02:18:53.04
than you've never given up and keep getting after it.

2371
02:18:53.04 --> 02:18:55.04
So, until next time,

2372
02:18:55.04 --> 02:18:59.04
this is Echo and Jockel.

2373
02:18:59.04 --> 02:19:16.04
Out.
