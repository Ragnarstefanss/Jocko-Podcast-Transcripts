00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.50
This is Jockel podcast number 250 with echo channels and me, Jockel willing. Good evening echo.

2
00:00:06.50 --> 00:00:13.98
Good evening. So on the last podcast number 249, we were reading the newest edition of the book about

3
00:00:13.98 --> 00:00:20.000
face by Colonel David Hackworth, which has a written forward in it written by me. And if you haven't

4
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:27.000
listened to 249 yet, just go back right now and listen to that one first. And we ended up

5
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
reading some of the book, but we just started to scratch the surface and look, I was prepping

6
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.000
for this podcast and saying, you know what, we should read a little bit more. Read a little

7
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:45.000
bit more from the book, talk about it a little bit more. And just as things start to pick up in the

8
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Korean war, we just start to learn these incredible lessons. So we're going to take one more look at about

9
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:58.000
face today picking up. It actually picks up, you know that when you write a book, they

10
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.000
want you to have like the big action scene in the beginning. Why? Did not know that, but I understand.

11
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Right. Right. So they want, you know, the reader to not, you know, to pick up the book and invest

12
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
something into the book. So this book starts off with a big time action scene that we actually

13
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:22.000
read last time. So this is a later chapter, but it actually predates the big action scene of February

14
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
six, which is this battle where he gets wounded and you get shot in the head. David Hackworth

15
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:35.000
gets shot in the head and all this may happen. So this is actually predates that with him kind of

16
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
showing up in Korea. And so that's what we're going to do. We're going to talk through some of these things.

17
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000
And I'll just slow it down and talk about some of the things that I pull out of this book. So here we go.

18
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Back to the book. The course of the Korean War had changed dramatically since it's lightning

19
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.000
fast beginning. At the start, US forces hopelessly outnumbered outgunned and undertrained had been

20
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:05.000
driven back by the North Koreans into the tiniest corner of South Korea beyond the Nat-Tong river.

21
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:12.000
There, the eight army dug in its heels, determinedly holding what was known as the Pusan

22
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000
perimeter until September when MacArthur's daring amphibious invasion at Inchon severed

23
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
the North Korean armies lines of communications and chopped its legs out from under it.

24
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.000
No longer was the enemy ineffective fighting force and our certain defeat along the lines of

25
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Dunkirk in 1940 suddenly appeared to be surefire victory. Units of the eight army smashed out of

26
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:43.000
Naktong perimeter. Spirits were high as we raised North beyond the 38 parallel beyond the North Korean capital of

27
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Pyongyang to within spitting distance of the Yallu River. The dividing line between North Korea and

28
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:56.000
North Korea was being blocked further north of the weather worsened and enemy resistance increased.

29
00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:04.000
It was like compressing a spring. The night the Chinese came. I was in a foxhole in the centre

30
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:11.000
of my scout section's defensive position. Now let's think about that. The night the Chinese came.

31
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:18.000
That's a scary thing. Every time I read about the Korean War, which we've covered several

32
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:28.000
Korean war memoirs on this podcast, what a savage scenario that was. It's called the Fragotten

33
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:38.000
War. I did that piece on Memorial Day and talked about the Fragotten War and just about

34
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.000
how anyone that was there could never forget what those guys went through in any way.

35
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:51.000
You pay any attention to it whatsoever. You realize that we should always remember what sacrifices

36
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:59.000
were made in the Korean War and a lot of it. This sentence right here, the night the Chinese came.

37
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:06.000
So here we go. The night the Chinese came. I was in a foxhole in the centre of my scout sections defensive position.

38
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:12.000
The sector was densely covered with screw pines and scrubbokes. My foxhole buddy and I were sitting on the

39
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:21.000
edges of our hole when we saw and it was like right out of a cartoon, a row of small trees moving toward us.

40
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:29.000
We chopped them down along with a little China men creeping along behind each one with hand grenades, but that was just the beginning.

41
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:38.000
The next thing I saw was what I could only describe as a wave, a human wave of Chinese crashing over us.

42
00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:47.000
For the next three hours they came. Walto Walchina men, many of whom did not even have rifles.

43
00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:56.000
Only long lances tipped with bayonets. Others were armed with US Thompson submachine guns or Russian drum fed.

44
00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:03.000
Assault rifles for the main. They were sorry shots with no understanding of basic infantry tactics, but what the Chinese

45
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:10.000
lacked in proficiency they made up for numbers and their presence heralded the start of the largest and most

46
00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:23.000
bitter retreat in US Army history. So that's crazy. Right. You've got these Chinese coming and they've got spears.

47
00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.000
And can you imagine, imagine people coming at you for 10 minutes.

48
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:34.000
Right. Like can you imagine enough people that they can come at you for 10 minutes. Now imagine 30 minutes.

49
00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:46.000
And you imagine how many people that is now imagine three hours of people coming at you.

50
00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.000
Upon my arrival in Korea, I'd been assigned the 25th recon company as replacement scout section leader.

51
00:05:51.000 --> 00:06:00.000
It was an army mistake. My military occupational specialty was infantry, not armored recon and it had upset me to know

52
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:07.000
end because 25th recon guys were not eligible for the C.I.B. regardless of how much infantry combat they saw.

53
00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:13.000
So the C.I.B. is the combat infantryman badge. And that's what you get when you direct combat in the Army.

54
00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:22.000
And it's let's say that's like a serious mark of pride in the Army because that means you've been in the shit.

55
00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:27.000
So you can see a little bit of ego creeping out from David Hacworth because he's like, what are you kidding me?

56
00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.000
We're just recon and we're not even eligible for getting the C.I.B.

57
00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
This is garbage.

58
00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.000
Continuing. Add to that, my carthro's brilliant stroke at Inchon.

59
00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.000
The war had seemed over-save for the victory parade.

60
00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:49.000
And I'd been sick that after all I'd gone through to get here, I'd missed the guts of the whole damn show.

61
00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
This is just once again. This is typical be careful what you wish for.

62
00:06:52.000 --> 00:07:01.000
He's thinking after Inchon, Americans had such a leg up that, ah, I missed it. I missed the war.

63
00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.000
I hadn't wanted to show up in another occupation force.

64
00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.000
So in the Army, when he joined the Army, he went to Europe.

65
00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.000
And World War II was over. And so he showed up there and he was just, you know,

66
00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:18.000
standing around and starting, standing guard duty and stuff like that. They were training, but whatever.

67
00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
He wasn't getting the combat that he wanted.

68
00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:25.000
So he's afraid when he shows up in Korea, oh, they did this big move in Chon.

69
00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
You weren't not going to get in the combat.

70
00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:36.000
I hadn't wanted to end up in another occupation force. Still, Sergeant Combat, and that's the nickname that he earned himself.

71
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:42.000
Even when there was no combat when he was in Europe, but he was just so fired up.

72
00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
They called him Sergeant Combat.

73
00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:52.000
Only in a new theater, in my heart, I'd secretly wish the war would continue long enough to let me get involved in at least one good fight.

74
00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000
My wish came true only too well.

75
00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:01.000
My first real firefight. And this is good, too. It's always good to hear this, right?

76
00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:09.000
Because there's such a huge amount of difference between your first firefight and your next one.

77
00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:14.000
Just like any, anything that we do, anything that you do is a human being that learning curve,

78
00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.000
when you see something for the first time, is the steepest learning curve you're going to get.

79
00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
So it's always good to think about these things.

80
00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:25.000
My first real firefight had occurred just before the Chinese came on a dull, overcast day.

81
00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:30.000
The scout section had set up near a secondary road. We spotted a squad of North Korean soldiers.

82
00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:35.000
Weapons at sling arms coming out of the tree line. They were good-looking troops, but asleep at the switch.

83
00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.000
They didn't see us. It was an amazing sense of power I felt.

84
00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:44.000
Ultimate power, I suppose. Just watching them come and holding that weapon in my hands.

85
00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:49.000
We let them get within about 30 yards before we cut loose.

86
00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:58.000
I dropped four guys, point blank with my M1, each dead with a six o'clock sight picture in the chest, just like the good book said.

87
00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:09.000
I felt no guilt, few of us did. I'd been trained too well and besides, the enemy had been utterly dehumanized throughout my training.

88
00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:14.000
They aren't men, they're just gooks. I fought.

89
00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:24.000
As the four enemy fell and a fierce firefight began, we knocked off the point element of a much larger enemy force and stirred up a hornet's nest.

90
00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:36.000
Okay, note on Gooks, the term, and this is in the book, it's an asterisk. The term Gook is derived from the Korean word, Han Gook, which means Korean person.

91
00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:42.000
So I know that it's an insensitive term. It's in the book.

92
00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.000
What is six o'clock sight picture mean?

93
00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:56.000
Just where he's lining up his weapon, the site on his weapon, six o'clock sight picture, basically a point of aim point of impact.

94
00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:06.000
So he's just aiming, I guess, like, towards the bottom of his, he's lining up the bottom of his sight on their chest.

95
00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:14.000
He's simply saying, like, made good shots, essentially like, like, lined up perfect.

96
00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:24.000
And like the good book says, I'm sure he's referring to, you know, army marksmanship manual, which says, you know, once you get this, you set the six o'clock of your sight onto the point of impact you want to hit.

97
00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:34.000
And I could be wrong about this because I'm not 100% sure, but it's something, meaning hey, he took the good solid sight picture that he's supposed to get.

98
00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.000
And on that he was taught, boom, hit him in the chest.

99
00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:44.000
But here's what sketchy is. These were just the point element, a bunch of people behind him.

100
00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:53.000
Following the lead of a lot of the older veterans earlier in the day, I'd placed several clips of Ammo on my rifle sling.

101
00:10:53.000 --> 00:11:00.000
I liked the look. It was kind of John Wayneish. And it seemed to make sense, a new clip only seconds away.

102
00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:10.000
Taking up my prone firing position, the sling had flopped on the rain so ground. Now as the firefight got going, I grabbed for a clip, only discovered that it and the rest of them were clogged with mud.

103
00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:17.000
But let's were flying in my brain, stalled out. I vaguely remembered an old tale about how well the M1 worked under any battlefield condition.

104
00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:25.000
Quickly knocking off the bigger pieces of muz mud, I oozed the clip up into my rifle. I got one round off the weapon jammed.

105
00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:33.000
And for the next few minutes, I sat in the ditch, field stripping, cleaning and reassembling the thing, while my first real combat went on without me.

106
00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:41.000
Our field artillery fire took the starch out of the North Korean advance, and we were able to scoot, ask with no friendly casualties.

107
00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:54.000
Other that is, then Sergeant Combat's bruised pride. My first firefight had been my first screw up. I didn't know until much later that you generally don't walk away from that one.

108
00:11:54.000 --> 00:12:05.000
What was that say? Be prepared. So here he is in his first firefight. He's got the cool guy band-lear scenario going on with his weapon and his mags.

109
00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:16.000
And it doesn't work out well. That's why you've got to rehearse things. How they're going to actually be. You can't just do something for the first time in combat and be like, oh, this will be fine.

110
00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:27.000
No. A few days later, five of us had been out on a reconnaissance patrol. It was a very black night saved for the US fliers that hung eerily over the battlefield.

111
00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:42.000
Very quiet, but for the occasional wine of artillery fire, the odd burst of an automatic weapon. We had moved about a mile into enemy territory when we heard motors, leaving the patrol. I crawled to a mound near the edge of the road for a first hand looked.

112
00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:52.000
Through the darkness, silhouetted by the artillery flares, I could see four enemy vehicles. A file of infantry was walking on each side of the motor column with more infantry walking in front.

113
00:12:52.000 --> 00:13:07.000
They were so close that I was sure the vehicles engines prevented them from hearing my pounding heart. They passed by. I was about to return to the patrol when I saw a lone North Korean soldier. His weapons long tracing a telephone wire.

114
00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:18.000
As he passed my position, I parted his hair with a submachine gun magazine and dragged him back to the patrol. So he knocked this dude out.

115
00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:33.000
Think about that. Like a massive patrol goes by, you find one lone guy and take a magazine out of your gear, hit him on the head with it, knock him out, and then drag him back to your patrol.

116
00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:40.000
The light wasn't far off when we headed home. Progress was slow. Initially we had to pack our zoned out prize.

117
00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:52.000
We later he awoke stumbled along diligently, but at least under his own steam. When we thought we had made it, we ran into a large enemy force moving down the road information.

118
00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:59.000
They were jabbering excitedly and dragging machine guns behind them on squeaky wheels. We were about six yards from the road.

119
00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:06.000
I lay on top of the prisoner, covered his mouth with my hand and pressed my trench knife hard against his throat.

120
00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:15.000
I thought the cold steel would be enough to convince him to be good, but it wasn't. Old habits die hard. He started squirming around.

121
00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:23.000
My hand was muffling his cries to his comrades. When he tried to bite it, I had no choice. I slid his throat.

122
00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:34.000
And lay there on top of him for what seemed like a bloody eternity until the road was clear, and we could hotfoot it back to the US lines.

123
00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
There you go.

124
00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000
Welcome to combat.

125
00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:47.000
I hadn't wanted to kill him. I would have rather the capture the guy. A live prisoner's worth of thousand dead, armbraze.

126
00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:57.000
But I was probably as scared as he was, and in a millionth of a second I had to decide and it was either him or my patrol.

127
00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:02.000
You know when people talk about the split seconds decisions you have to make in combat?

128
00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:08.000
There you go. What am I going to do? I'm going to kill this guy.

129
00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:17.000
Killing that guy in one other incident probably hammered home most of that career was not some training maneuver that I was really in war, boots and all.

130
00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:23.000
The other occurred when we were digging in on a small knob overlooking a main north south road.

131
00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:28.000
Dinging in was a task of a frontline trooper performed at least once a day went on the move.

132
00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:37.000
Usually spent to time cursing your commander for always choosing the hardest ground in the town, and then moving the line just when you'd finished your whole.

133
00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:43.000
Some of us thought it was an army plot to keep us in shape. For myself, I'd rather have done a million push-ups.

134
00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:54.000
But on this particular occasion we'd gotten some great dirt. It was soft and loose, a breeze to dig, and I was about two feet down in no time.

135
00:15:54.000 --> 00:16:02.000
Then my shovel hit something mushy. A few quick scrapes revealed an all-of-drab green material.

136
00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:11.000
A few more uncovered a decaying corpse of a man with bright red hair and a 24th division patch on his moldy fatigue jacket.

137
00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:18.000
The soldiers hands had been tied behind him with communication wire, and he'd been shot in the back of the head.

138
00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:28.000
Three more bodies were found by other troopers on our little knob all killed and buried the same way.

139
00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:33.000
Company was notified. They said the men had probably been killed at the beginning of the war.

140
00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:44.000
That was when the 24th division had fought along this road. We were instructed to dig out the dog tags and provide eight digit grid coordinates where each body was found.

141
00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:49.000
The atrocity did little from morale, but a lot for fighting spirit.

142
00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:55.000
There would be no love lost for an enemy as savage as the North Korean Reds.

143
00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:07.000
So much for the Korean police action. I and my friends thought this was all out war with no quarter given.

144
00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:13.000
He talked about dehumanizing the troops and I've talked about dehumanizing the enemy.

145
00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:18.000
That is something that absolutely the military will try and do.

146
00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:27.000
And it's a very crazy fine line to walk because as you dehumanize the enemy, you're also possibly dehumanizing this civilians that are in that area.

147
00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:31.000
And so you have a very sketchy scenario that can unfold.

148
00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:41.000
But they still have to do it to some level because otherwise you've got people, the US military, that in their mind, you know, it's a syndicula, whatever beliefs they have.

149
00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:46.000
They don't want to do it. And you're trying to convince them that it's okay because these aren't even people.

150
00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:50.000
They're not even humans. That's dehumanizing.

151
00:17:50.000 --> 00:18:00.000
And I've said before, and this is the type of thing that makes it very clear, you know, I've said that the, we didn't really, in Iraq,

152
00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:15.000
we didn't really have to dehumanize the enemy because the enemy dehumanized themselves with things that they did to the local populace torture, murder, rape, just complete in utter savagery.

153
00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:30.000
And that's the same thing that's happening right here. You know, you're finding Americans that have been bound executed in the back of the head and buried in shallow graves.

154
00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:41.000
Continuing on, now that the Chinese were in the conflict, the recon companies mission was to provide a reconnaissance screen in front of the 25th Infantry divisions with draw.

155
00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:49.000
In other words, to delay, deceive and disorganize the undeniable communist advance. So the Chinese are coming now.

156
00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:57.000
They've got the numbers, they've got the masses, they've got America on its heels, get the 25th ID,

157
00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:15.000
Tropic Lightning, by the way, Station Hawaii, I went out and spoke at the honor of speaking to the 25th ID just a historic group of soldiers.

158
00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:30.000
Chinese had struck the 8th Army like a giant steamroller, crushing many units and mulling most others. Eighth Army's commander Lieutenant General Walton Walker, who had said in July of 1950, as the first real Southward began,

159
00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:42.000
quote, there will be no done Kirk, there will be no baton, a retreat to Busan would be the greatest butcheries of history. We must fight until the end.

160
00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:50.000
And quote, now found himself directing yet another brave but bloody withdrawal to the South.

161
00:19:50.000 --> 00:20:01.000
Only seven years before General Eisenhower's forces were similarly surprised and smashed, but that time we'd had patten to save the day.

162
00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:12.000
In my heart of hearts, I kind of wished someone would get the idea to use our recon company to be the spearhead to bastone for the Korean conflict, but it was not to be in just as well.

163
00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:22.000
Unlike the 750 second recon, which had 17 M24 light tanks, we were a light skin force with only 6 M24s in the whole company.

164
00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:31.000
Divide these up amongst three identical potuins, and it wasn't exactly the punch Lieutenant Colonel Crayton Abrams had in 1944.

165
00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:37.000
Still, we had plenty to do to keep us occupied, exchanging ground for time.

166
00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:45.000
The drill went that we would hold a position until the enemy was breathing hot and heavy down our necks and we would break contact and run like hell.

167
00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:55.000
Leap frogging through another recon, puttune, a rifle unit that was set up behind us in the same way, so they're doing a cover and move as they're retreating.

168
00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:58.000
Trading ground for time.

169
00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:04.000
It was a dangerous game with no room for error and we found ourselves playing it day after day after day.

170
00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:17.000
They were strange dudes the Chinese, seemingly with no sense of personal peril as a bold statement, seemingly with no sense of personal peril.

171
00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:24.000
That's a human instinct of self preservation and they didn't seem to have it.

172
00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:33.000
When Seth Stone went into Saadar City, that was in 2008, we had fought in Ramadi in 2006.

173
00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:38.000
I was talking to him while he was there after the first couple operations that they ran.

174
00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:44.000
He said something similar, I don't remember the exact quote of what he said, but what he was trying to explain to me was,

175
00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:50.000
the fighters in Ramadi were perhaps better fighters more tactically skilled.

176
00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:55.000
He said, but he's like these guys in Saadar City, they don't care.

177
00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:58.000
They don't care if they die and they are just coming.

178
00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:05.000
And it's a different type of threat and it's a different scenario that's your under.

179
00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:13.000
It was not unusual to see them jump on a U.S. tank holding grenades and then scramble around looking for some opening to toss them in.

180
00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:19.000
Of course, if the tank was buttoned up, it was impossible and the tank commander inside would simply call another tank nearby two quotes,

181
00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:31.000
scratch my back, which at which point the second tank would spray the first tank with 30 caliber coaxle machine gunfire and wash the hitchhikers off.

182
00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:35.000
But there were always other Chinamen to take the dead ones places.

183
00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:40.000
It was a grim fact that we were constantly reminded of as we were moving south.

184
00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:46.000
Moral dropped with every rearward step of the humiliating retreat.

185
00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:53.000
That is the just important to remember that when things aren't going right, when you're in a leadership position and things aren't going right.

186
00:22:53.000 --> 00:23:01.000
And you have to retreat or you have to take a tactical withdrawal or you have to undo some of the progress that you've made or you have to abandon some of the work that you've done,

187
00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:03.000
which this is not just talking about war.

188
00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:06.000
I'm talking about any scenario business life.

189
00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:13.000
You've got when you have to retreat, you have to pay attention to them or all the troops because it sucks.

190
00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:18.000
It sucks and what it sucks is it sucks the morale right away from the troops.

191
00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:24.000
They've put forth this effort, they fought and bled when they've worked really hard to get to a certain point and now you're leaving.

192
00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:35.000
We kept falling back away from the Yalu Beyond Pyong-King until we'd refocused the 38th Parallel and we were back in South Korea.

193
00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:40.000
The only thing I think running faster than the 8th armor were the rumors.

194
00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:47.000
The Marines were cut off at a place called the Chosen Reservoir in the North and were being zeroed out.

195
00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:51.000
The US Army 10 Corps had surrendered.

196
00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:54.000
Boats were waiting at Pusan Harbor to take us to Japan.

197
00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:58.000
These are all just crazy rumors that are going around partially true, partially untrue.

198
00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:03.000
Maybe meanwhile while winter had arrived but winter gear had not.

199
00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:07.000
MacArthur had said we'd be home before Christmas.

200
00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:16.000
I guess his supply people believed him because the Chinese had caught us with our pants down and they were summer trousers.

201
00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:20.000
Feet and leather boots froze.

202
00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:29.000
Gloves and mittens were scarce as good-looking girls are field jackets where it's thin and protective as page one of the newspaper.

203
00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:41.000
We were slowly freezing to death in the bitter below zero weather while the Chinese gangas cons mighty hordes marched on seemingly unstoppable.

204
00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:44.000
Logistics wins wars and here you are.

205
00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:56.000
It's crazy to think about this compared to either Napoleon's march into Russia, which we've covered on this podcast with the memories of an Napoleonic foot soldier.

206
00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:04.000
And however you know we don't need winter stuff we should be done by winter and then same thing with the Nazis going into Russia.

207
00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:06.000
Installing around freezing.

208
00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:09.000
How come we don't learn these lessons? How come?

209
00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:13.000
You know this is something to do with I was talking about the other day.

210
00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:17.000
When you come up with a freaking plan you need to have a negative attitude.

211
00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:22.000
You need to have a negative attitude. You're attitude can't be where you're going to be home by Christmas.

212
00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:29.000
That's just wrong. Your attitude has to be this could take five years or more.

213
00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:33.000
We need to be ready for the worst case scenario.

214
00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:36.000
Going in there and thinking we'll be home by Christmas.

215
00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:43.000
Like let's say if that if if if MacArthur uttered that one time which he did.

216
00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:47.000
Think of the effect and impact that has on the rest of the chain of command.

217
00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:51.000
Think of the impact that that has on the whole supply logistics chain.

218
00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:54.000
When they go I know it's going to be over by Christmas.

219
00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:58.000
I guess it's not really that important that we get good boots for the men.

220
00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:04.000
I guess it's really not that important that we get good warm jackets for the men.

221
00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:07.000
Just a little hint of that.

222
00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:13.000
Yeah. I feel like I kind of fall into that trap a lot of times when you go in somewhere.

223
00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:15.000
And you know what that is?

224
00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:22.000
That is an extreme form of decentralized command. It's an extreme form of

225
00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:25.000
Commanders intent.

226
00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:30.000
Right. So so lately I've been talking about the fact that culture is.

227
00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:38.000
Culture is like the most premier highest form of decentralized command and commanders intent.

228
00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:44.000
Because if our culture is for instance, hey, we always take care of the customer.

229
00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:45.000
Right.

230
00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:50.000
Then you echo Charles as a frontline guy working at a cash register.

231
00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:55.000
You can make a decision on what to do with the customer because you know that our customer is the most important thing.

232
00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:02.000
If you know that listen, we always treat civilians with the utmost respect.

233
00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.000
That's our culture.

234
00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:10.000
When you get into a situation where there's a wounded mom and a house with a building.

235
00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:15.000
You make that a priority and you take care of them and you get met a vacuum and casualty care for that individual.

236
00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:15.000
Right.

237
00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.000
Because that's our culture.

238
00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:21.000
So culture is like the highest form of decentralized command.

239
00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:23.000
What happens?

240
00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:30.000
When you give commanders intent just by saying something is innocent as will be home by Christmas.

241
00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:35.000
Think of how that reverberates throughout the organization.

242
00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:37.000
Everybody goes out.

243
00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:40.000
That's not what good.

244
00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:48.000
Because you can think about the herkily and efforts that it takes to get, you know, 200,000 warm jackets and pairs of boots and specific sizes.

245
00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:49.000
That's the no no joke.

246
00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:51.000
You can't just snap your fingers and that happens.

247
00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:52.000
It's going to take effort.

248
00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.000
It's going to take effort at every level.

249
00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:58.000
People stepping up to make things happen.

250
00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:06.000
You know, like in a communist country when I remember when the Polish were kind of striking against the against the against the

251
00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:12.000
communist regime there, they would just make little small mistakes and factors.

252
00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:19.000
You can prevent things from happening by just doing a little bit just by just dragging your feet just a little bit.

253
00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:24.000
Because if you drag your feet just a little bit, hey, maybe it's not that big of a deal.

254
00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:29.000
But if there's a hundred people and you're all dragging your feet, we're not making progress anymore.

255
00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:35.000
So you picture an entire supply chain that hears, eh, it'll be over by Christmas.

256
00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:37.000
How much efforts put being put forth?

257
00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:38.000
You know, sure.

258
00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:41.000
Do you have some really great people in there somewhere that are going to get after it?

259
00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:42.000
Yeah, you do.

260
00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:48.000
Does that overcome the other 94% of the people that are dragging their feet and it's not that big of a deal?

261
00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:51.000
And hey, I'm going to still head home at four o'clock today.

262
00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:52.000
Man.

263
00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:55.000
You know, you have the jacket thing.

264
00:28:55.000 --> 00:29:02.000
But, you know, like when you go somewhere, I don't know, the park, carnival, whatever.

265
00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:06.000
And you kind of don't account for the weather or, you know, like when the sun goes down.

266
00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:08.000
You do account for the weather.

267
00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:10.000
But I know where you go.

268
00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:15.000
Yeah, like to me, the weather is I look outside and boom, that's the weather.

269
00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:16.000
Yeah.

270
00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:22.000
But meanwhile, my wife is like, oh, bring the jacket, bring the water just in case they get thirsty.

271
00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:26.000
And you get there, you know, whatever all the stuff she's bringing these bags.

272
00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.000
I'll stick around and eat bags.

273
00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:30.000
You know, I don't need all this stuff on the park.

274
00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:32.000
You don't need to meet really.

275
00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:34.000
And so did she let you learn your lesson each and every time?

276
00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:35.000
Yeah, pretty much.

277
00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:36.000
Yeah.

278
00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:46.000
You go there and there's the thing that in my, I mean, in my particular case, which, you know, maybe this applies to others as well, where I won't learn the lesson every single time because sometimes I'm like fine.

279
00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.000
You know, sometimes I do make it all.

280
00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:49.000
You read the course.

281
00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:52.000
You read and force the lesson of being a slacker.

282
00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:53.000
Yeah, it's exactly right.

283
00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:54.000
So, right.

284
00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:56.000
This is not an easy lesson, right?

285
00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:57.000
Okay.

286
00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:58.000
So, we live.

287
00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:02.000
Collectively, you and I, at this time, we live in San Diego, California.

288
00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:08.000
And what's interesting about San Diego, California is if you go out to dinner.

289
00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:10.000
Let's say right now, what is it?

290
00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:12.000
October, 2020.

291
00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:20.000
If you go out for dinner at six o'clock at night, the sun is still up.

292
00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.000
And it's, it's warm outside.

293
00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:24.000
It's 80 degrees.

294
00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:28.000
Yeah. There's no need for a jacket isn't even conceivable.

295
00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:32.000
But if you're going to eat outside, and the sun's going to go down, it is going to get chilly.

296
00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:34.000
It's going to get chilly.

297
00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.000
It's going to get 50 degrees.

298
00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:36.000
Yeah.

299
00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:40.000
That's going to happen in, you know, three, four hours.

300
00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:42.000
So, yes.

301
00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:48.000
When you, you know, when you used to, that scenario being the case, it like it's easier or whatever.

302
00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:50.000
But man, yeah, it does kind of take this weird mindset.

303
00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:52.000
I had that exact scenario happen, by the way.

304
00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:56.000
Like the, like a week ago, whatever, my wife's birthday.

305
00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:00.000
We go to this rat, it's called like sea level.

306
00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:02.000
I don't know, one of these, you know, I've been there.

307
00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:08.000
Yeah, no, actually, yes, some of the guys there said that you've been there.

308
00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:12.000
After, so I was like, all right, cool.

309
00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:14.000
But one of our people works there.

310
00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:16.000
Yeah.

311
00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:16.000
Yeah.

312
00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.000
One of our GG2 people.

313
00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:20.000
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, fully.

314
00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:24.000
Yeah. So I go there. So we go and, you know, it's more.

315
00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:26.000
It's kind of high. It's been hot.

316
00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:28.000
So I'm like, all right, same tactics, right?

317
00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:30.000
Look outside. What's the weather? Like, oh, we're sitting outside.

318
00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:34.000
Cool. I look outside. Weather, hot, sunny, whatever.

319
00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:38.000
And here's the thing. My wife kind of felt that she didn't fall for her.

320
00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:42.000
But she kind of was like, kind of was feeling the same thing.

321
00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:46.000
So it's like whatever. No jackets, it didn't bring jackets for the kids.

322
00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:49.000
Nothing like that. So we go in there and our seats are, yes, outside.

323
00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:51.000
But covered.

324
00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:53.000
So a little bit of an ocean breeze going through there.

325
00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:55.000
And here's the thing, what's it called?

326
00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:57.000
I wouldn't call it cold, but it was something.

327
00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:59.000
Like you had like chicken skin, everyone's in a while.

328
00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:01.000
You wanted that lightweight.

329
00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:01.000
Light, light, light, light, light.

330
00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:03.000
It would have been perfect.

331
00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:04.000
What have been perfect.

332
00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:06.000
And here's the thing is it wasn't about me.

333
00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:07.000
It was about the kids.

334
00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:08.000
Yeah.

335
00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:08.000
But he out's.

336
00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:10.000
You did you trick it at four year old.

337
00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:14.000
And a seven year old that's just slightly uncomfortable and chilly.

338
00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:17.000
They might not throw attention, but you're going to hear about it.

339
00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:19.000
You can learn this lesson.

340
00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:21.000
It's a good lesson.

341
00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:23.000
You seem to have to learn it over and over again.

342
00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:25.000
Some of my kids know it.

343
00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:27.000
They think, you know, they're bringing.

344
00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:29.000
I was going to meet my, meet my family.

345
00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:31.000
Like I, I think we were recording one day.

346
00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:33.000
And I was going to meet my family somewhere,

347
00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:35.000
eating outside.

348
00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:36.000
COVID.

349
00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:38.000
You got to eat outside and whatnot.

350
00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:39.000
Right?

351
00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:45.000
So, but my son actually just showed up with a sweatshirt for me.

352
00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:47.000
Tread it right and full credit.

353
00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:49.000
Oh, it's full credit on that one.

354
00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:50.000
Yeah.

355
00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:51.000
Because that's like.

356
00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:53.000
And really the whole reason is like,

357
00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:55.000
bro, why do I want to?

358
00:32:55.000 --> 00:33:00.000
Why am I going to wear myself down carrying this jacket when I probably won't need it.

359
00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:03.000
Why am I going to carry this, you know, bag of.

360
00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:06.000
Additional clothing when we're not going to need all this stuff.

361
00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:07.000
Why this big.

362
00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:09.000
Bottillal water, you know.

363
00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:11.000
Brother is water there.

364
00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:14.000
You know, like bring all this stuff.

365
00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:19.60
load like you know anyway so yeah but again like yeah that mindset you're

366
00:33:19.60 --> 00:33:23.20
gonna get jammed up or potentially get jammed up in the you know in the future

367
00:33:23.20 --> 00:33:28.20
you gotta plan for that kind of stuff which I think my wife is like that's her

368
00:33:28.20 --> 00:33:32.48
whole jam. It's like what do we need what she'll overdo it you know but I'll

369
00:33:32.48 --> 00:33:36.32
underdo it I think like the answer the solutions right there in the middle.

370
00:33:36.32 --> 00:33:38.08
How do you guys can find a balance?

371
00:33:38.08 --> 00:33:43.68
We're gonna be responsibly evaluate future scenarios yes.

372
00:33:43.68 --> 00:33:48.20
They were not only short on cold weather gear continuing on back to the

373
00:33:48.20 --> 00:33:52.60
book food was in short supply. All spare time was spent scrounging one of the most

374
00:33:52.60 --> 00:33:57.000
modern armies in the world became an army of days past foraging and living off

375
00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:01.96
the land we kicked in the walls of houses searching for rice and kimchi,

376
00:34:01.96 --> 00:34:07.12
hidden in false walls and secret caches we cooked what we found in our steel

377
00:34:07.12 --> 00:34:11.40
pots. When nothing else was available we take the sea rash and packets of

378
00:34:11.40 --> 00:34:15.64
sugar powder coffee powdered milk and chocolate we'd stored for days like

379
00:34:15.64 --> 00:34:19.12
squirrels and the pockets of our fatigues mashed all together with snow on our

380
00:34:19.12 --> 00:34:22.40
helmets and tricking our trick ourselves into believing it was ice cream.

381
00:34:22.40 --> 00:34:27.84
Trying to beat the elements became a war in itself it was so bitterly cold

382
00:34:27.84 --> 00:34:31.88
you couldn't sleep you had to keep moving stomping feet and flexing fingers

383
00:34:31.88 --> 00:34:36.72
24 hours a day those who didn't were saying goodbye to their hands and feet and

384
00:34:36.72 --> 00:34:40.76
in some cases their lives for a while every day a couple men were evacuated

385
00:34:40.76 --> 00:34:44.88
because of frostbite black toes and fingers to be caught off at the hospital.

386
00:34:44.88 --> 00:34:49.56
Grenades knives and ammo would freeze fast to the fox hole brim weapons froze

387
00:34:49.56 --> 00:34:54.28
too you'd have to kick the bolts of the M1 and Browning automatic rifles to get

388
00:34:54.28 --> 00:34:58.76
them back we seldom had rifle patches to clean our weapons most of us cut

389
00:34:58.76 --> 00:35:02.52
little squares out of our shirts or trousers to do the best we could.

390
00:35:02.52 --> 00:35:07.84
Gun oil was a luxury usually beyond our reach we lubricated our weapons with

391
00:35:07.84 --> 00:35:13.64
motor oil or the frozen lard of sea rations and took to keeping them with us in

392
00:35:13.64 --> 00:35:20.28
our fart sacks at night staying alive became our only concern and we did man is

393
00:35:20.28 --> 00:35:24.76
most adaptable when we passed through villages if a house had a lot of wood

394
00:35:24.76 --> 00:35:30.36
doors window frame even the most beautiful hand carved furniture we burn it

395
00:35:30.36 --> 00:35:34.48
one piece at the time finishing off the job by throwing a thermite grenade on

396
00:35:34.48 --> 00:35:38.40
the fat roof and standing by until the whole structure was burned to the ground.

397
00:35:38.40 --> 00:35:44.48
Our orders were to destroy anything the enemy could use gladly we thought

398
00:35:44.48 --> 00:35:47.32
to ourselves and we could stay warm while we did it.

399
00:35:47.32 --> 00:35:51.72
At night we would carefully obsessively bundle stack and restack

400
00:35:51.72 --> 00:35:55.80
canling wood while waiting for daybreak when we could light our fires the

401
00:35:55.80 --> 00:36:01.20
fault of those friendly flames allowed us to make it through the night instantaneously

402
00:36:01.20 --> 00:36:05.60
at first light thousands of tiny fires which spring up across the front and around

403
00:36:05.60 --> 00:36:10.68
each huddled a cluster of shivering men it was probably as bad in the Chinese camp

404
00:36:10.68 --> 00:36:15.76
except that at least the chinks were prepared with winter gear down trousers and

405
00:36:15.76 --> 00:36:20.40
jackets long overcoats that blended in with a snow and down mittens that we

406
00:36:20.40 --> 00:36:24.28
liberated and war until our own supply people came through.

407
00:36:24.28 --> 00:36:29.32
It was a frigid brutal soul destroying time.

408
00:36:29.32 --> 00:36:35.20
I knew then how the winter mark, I knew then how the vermark must have felt during

409
00:36:35.20 --> 00:36:39.60
World War II or how Napoleon's army must have suffered years and years before

410
00:36:39.60 --> 00:36:46.80
that when each made their horrible winter retreat from Russia.

411
00:36:46.80 --> 00:36:54.88
Like I said, it's just it's savage frigid brutal soul destroying time and this is coming

412
00:36:54.88 --> 00:37:00.48
from the perspective of a guy that you know served multiple combat t-tours in Vietnam

413
00:37:00.48 --> 00:37:02.48
as well.

414
00:37:02.48 --> 00:37:07.20
By the time we reached Seoul the North Korean capital once a bustling city of millions was

415
00:37:07.20 --> 00:37:10.16
virtually deserted and empty gray tomb.

416
00:37:10.16 --> 00:37:16.16
Most of its inhabitants and those in the northern villages on its outskirts had left

417
00:37:16.16 --> 00:37:21.44
and headed south with a few possessions they could carry clogging the roads with walled

418
00:37:21.44 --> 00:37:23.28
the wall human misery.

419
00:37:23.28 --> 00:37:28.000
On one occasion American fighter planes must have concluded that the horrors of desperate

420
00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:32.12
civilians were Chinese columns moving south.

421
00:37:32.12 --> 00:37:37.96
P-51s had strafed the refugees and for at least a mile they were dead littered across

422
00:37:37.96 --> 00:37:39.80
the road.

423
00:37:39.80 --> 00:37:44.12
Retreating vehicles had to push the bodies out of the way.

424
00:37:44.12 --> 00:37:50.36
It was here that I realized it was only the guys on the ground who saw and understood

425
00:37:50.36 --> 00:37:53.80
the real horrors of war.

426
00:37:53.80 --> 00:37:59.84
To air force pilots war as a remote thing they make their kills from hundreds or thousands

427
00:37:59.84 --> 00:38:01.80
of feet in the air.

428
00:38:01.80 --> 00:38:06.12
Even the guys who fly on the deck do so in a flash dropping their loads and flying

429
00:38:06.12 --> 00:38:08.24
away without seeing the results.

430
00:38:08.24 --> 00:38:13.88
The way homes and people are blown to smithereens or the effects of Nepal.

431
00:38:13.88 --> 00:38:19.72
That night they didn't have to listen as we did in the winter of 1950 to the whale of

432
00:38:19.72 --> 00:38:25.60
the Gooks cries of civilian refugees begging to be let through American lines or see

433
00:38:25.60 --> 00:38:30.56
in the morning when they were allowed to pass through the dead they'd left behind.

434
00:38:30.56 --> 00:38:35.76
Those who'd frozen the death in open rice patties overnight.

435
00:38:35.76 --> 00:38:41.36
The pilot when he finishes his days work flies back to his base.

436
00:38:41.36 --> 00:38:47.48
The guns goes to the club has a big stake and if he wants to forget the days combat he

437
00:38:47.48 --> 00:38:50.32
can drink himself into a stupor.

438
00:38:50.32 --> 00:38:52.88
The frontline fighter can't do that.

439
00:38:52.88 --> 00:38:58.32
He lives with death and the horror of the battlefield every day and every night it is his

440
00:38:58.32 --> 00:39:08.96
cross to bear.

441
00:39:08.96 --> 00:39:11.60
We continued retreating.

442
00:39:11.60 --> 00:39:18.16
Gray, rotting bodies, the unforgettable smell of death, rats feasting on the dead and growing

443
00:39:18.16 --> 00:39:21.44
boulder by the day.

444
00:39:21.44 --> 00:39:26.44
This, the flotsome jetsome of war, let us through soul.

445
00:39:26.44 --> 00:39:30.72
Our unit's mission was to fight a rear guard action in the center of the city.

446
00:39:30.72 --> 00:39:34.68
The scout section rifle squad set up at a downtown intersection.

447
00:39:34.68 --> 00:39:39.40
We took over a bank of drugs to our two other corner buildings for my command post.

448
00:39:39.40 --> 00:39:45.04
I'd use the bank's manager's plush office, which was a welcome diversion from the cold

449
00:39:45.04 --> 00:39:46.04
and snow.

450
00:39:46.04 --> 00:39:48.20
The bank vault was locked tight.

451
00:39:48.20 --> 00:39:53.40
As the self appointed new bank manager, I authorized the guys to open it with their 3.5

452
00:39:53.40 --> 00:39:55.04
anti tank pazuka.

453
00:39:55.04 --> 00:40:00.12
Two rounds later the door swung open as easy as a sea rash and can in the hands of a hungry

454
00:40:00.12 --> 00:40:05.04
trooper, the vault contained thousands of dollars in small Korean notes.

455
00:40:05.04 --> 00:40:06.68
All the big stuff was gone.

456
00:40:06.68 --> 00:40:08.76
I told everyone to cash in.

457
00:40:08.76 --> 00:40:12.28
No withdrawal forms needed, I said.

458
00:40:12.28 --> 00:40:13.28
And they did.

459
00:40:13.28 --> 00:40:18.44
We had the laugh at the propaganda leaflets at the Chinese mortar down upon us from the hills.

460
00:40:18.44 --> 00:40:21.48
They occupied on the high ground around soul.

461
00:40:21.48 --> 00:40:24.68
Quote American capitalists running dogs of Wall Street.

462
00:40:24.68 --> 00:40:26.04
They accused.

463
00:40:26.04 --> 00:40:29.88
How right they are, I thought, as we stuffed our pockets and packs.

464
00:40:29.88 --> 00:40:34.32
And even made hobo sacks to carry our spoils of war.

465
00:40:34.32 --> 00:40:40.08
It was strange watching the Chinese brazenly looking down from those hills about 600 yards

466
00:40:40.08 --> 00:40:41.08
away.

467
00:40:41.08 --> 00:40:45.44
Our infantry weapons were out of range preventing a little selective sniping, but we were

468
00:40:45.44 --> 00:40:50.84
able to put some effective fire on them with the M24's main gun and had the great

469
00:40:50.84 --> 00:40:54.72
fun of taking pot shots with the turrets 50 kel.

470
00:40:54.72 --> 00:40:58.40
The Chinese went to ground and shy of a cheerless Christmas.

471
00:40:58.40 --> 00:41:03.04
We slipped out of the sad, near-dissorted soul.

472
00:41:03.04 --> 00:41:07.16
My sections new found wealth was the first thing to be tossed on the side of the road.

473
00:41:07.16 --> 00:41:12.36
Bokey Dollars meant nothing, meant little to worn out troopers, and it had been just

474
00:41:12.36 --> 00:41:15.04
a game anyway.

475
00:41:15.04 --> 00:41:19.16
South of Seoul, we found ourselves caught in a friendly battle zone.

476
00:41:19.16 --> 00:41:23.72
A railway yard being blasted to kingdom come by demolition-toting engineers and air force

477
00:41:23.72 --> 00:41:24.72
bombers.

478
00:41:24.72 --> 00:41:29.64
The railroad flat cars complete with brand new vehicles and tanks which would have been distributed

479
00:41:29.64 --> 00:41:34.12
to the front lines had it not collapsed, were being blown sky-high to keep them out of

480
00:41:34.12 --> 00:41:35.44
enemy lines.

481
00:41:35.44 --> 00:41:40.68
To us in the middle the challenge of this army obstacle course was not only to avoid our

482
00:41:40.68 --> 00:41:46.88
own flying debris, but also the enemy incoming which was pouring in throughout the operation.

483
00:41:46.88 --> 00:41:49.88
Yeah, that's a scary sight.

484
00:41:49.88 --> 00:41:52.96
So you've got, and it shows you that I guess it shows not scary.

485
00:41:52.96 --> 00:41:57.20
It's the desperation of the situation that you're in that you've got however many numbers

486
00:41:57.20 --> 00:42:00.28
of vehicles that we're going to be shipped up to the front time and now we're just blowing

487
00:42:00.28 --> 00:42:02.44
them in place so that the enemy does capture them.

488
00:42:02.44 --> 00:42:10.36
You want to talk about a moral, a morale crusher.

489
00:42:10.36 --> 00:42:14.000
We came upon the number of freight cars with sealed doors.

490
00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:20.16
One of the guys pride one open reveal an entire car load of PX supplies soap, cigarette,

491
00:42:20.16 --> 00:42:21.16
after-save lotion.

492
00:42:21.16 --> 00:42:26.40
Obviously, goodies needed by our re-election on comrades.

493
00:42:26.40 --> 00:42:28.40
And we decided to help ourselves.

494
00:42:28.40 --> 00:42:33.60
Someone drove a brand new three-quarter ton truck off a nearby flat car so we had a way

495
00:42:33.60 --> 00:42:36.96
to get away with how to get to carry out our loot.

496
00:42:36.96 --> 00:42:41.64
It fell about four feet and crashed to the ground, springs breaking, fenders collapsing,

497
00:42:41.64 --> 00:42:42.64
but it's still ran.

498
00:42:42.64 --> 00:42:44.20
That's a comic scene, right?

499
00:42:44.20 --> 00:42:49.12
You've got this vehicle on a flat pit, out of flat freight train and just drive it off and

500
00:42:49.12 --> 00:42:53.60
Duke's a hazard style.

501
00:42:53.60 --> 00:42:58.76
We loaded our spoils onto the truck even as telephone poles and large chunks of steel

502
00:42:58.76 --> 00:43:00.40
rain down around us.

503
00:43:00.40 --> 00:43:03.88
Then we jumped aboard ourselves and unass to the place.

504
00:43:03.88 --> 00:43:09.12
Eight recon men bouncing along and light in a truck right out of the grapes a raft.

505
00:43:09.12 --> 00:43:12.48
We motored by a batowing infantry hiking south down the road.

506
00:43:12.48 --> 00:43:17.08
Hey, how you fix for cigarettes we called and aquavelva anyone as we threw all the

507
00:43:17.08 --> 00:43:20.44
troopers a little something. We ran out of goodies about the same time our mobile pack

508
00:43:20.44 --> 00:43:25.64
p.x ran out of gas and we reluctantly turned to the return to the backs of our tanks with

509
00:43:25.64 --> 00:43:28.04
the rest of our platoon.

510
00:43:28.04 --> 00:43:29.68
We were young.

511
00:43:29.68 --> 00:43:35.64
Sometimes the war was great fun, like a game of cops and robbers or cowboy and Indians that

512
00:43:35.64 --> 00:43:41.44
you played as kids.

513
00:43:41.44 --> 00:43:44.48
You know, it's from a maturity level, right?

514
00:43:44.48 --> 00:43:51.12
It's something that's just so it's important to remember man that you're dealing with people

515
00:43:51.12 --> 00:43:53.92
that are 1920 years old, 21 years old.

516
00:43:53.92 --> 00:43:57.84
I mean, hack worse one of the older guys.

517
00:43:57.84 --> 00:44:05.76
Most of these guys, a lot of these guys, when you go into the military, it's young kids.

518
00:44:05.76 --> 00:44:10.20
When I went in, I was 18 years old.

519
00:44:10.20 --> 00:44:14.76
I'm a, you know, my judgment, you know, when you talk about, so what is it?

520
00:44:14.76 --> 00:44:17.68
Development of the prefrontal cortex, right?

521
00:44:17.68 --> 00:44:22.12
Which has a man doesn't develop until you're something like 25.

522
00:44:22.12 --> 00:44:23.12
Yes.

523
00:44:23.12 --> 00:44:28.36
So you gotta find your way through seven years of military service where your freaking

524
00:44:28.36 --> 00:44:32.12
decision-making process is not fully developed yet.

525
00:44:32.12 --> 00:44:34.12
That's how dumb shit happens.

526
00:44:34.12 --> 00:44:35.12
Yeah.

527
00:44:35.12 --> 00:44:36.12
Makes sense.

528
00:44:36.12 --> 00:44:38.000
You do dumb shit.

529
00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:41.04
That's why leadership is so important in the military.

530
00:44:41.04 --> 00:44:44.24
But the thing is, sometimes the military leaders are only 23.

531
00:44:44.24 --> 00:44:51.60
They're still not even there yet.

532
00:44:51.60 --> 00:44:57.16
Continuing on, the politics or purpose of the war was not our concern.

533
00:44:57.16 --> 00:45:00.32
We didn't understand or care about the big picture anymore than we really understood the

534
00:45:00.32 --> 00:45:01.72
risks of combat.

535
00:45:01.72 --> 00:45:04.04
Of being killed or going home without a leg.

536
00:45:04.04 --> 00:45:07.88
After a while, you stop worrying if the next minute you were going to get it.

537
00:45:07.88 --> 00:45:10.88
Instead, you just prayed for a clean wound so you could get out of there.

538
00:45:10.88 --> 00:45:14.20
A million dollar wound to get you home.

539
00:45:14.20 --> 00:45:15.20
You know, it was crazy.

540
00:45:15.20 --> 00:45:23.68
We had Dean Ladon and he was going into Tarua where the Japanese had a freaking island

541
00:45:23.68 --> 00:45:25.80
fortress.

542
00:45:25.80 --> 00:45:28.80
And I asked him, I was like, were you worried about getting wounded or anything?

543
00:45:28.80 --> 00:45:33.76
And he's like, no, that would be someone else.

544
00:45:33.76 --> 00:45:35.08
That's the deal, man.

545
00:45:35.08 --> 00:45:40.48
It's not going to happen to me.

546
00:45:40.48 --> 00:45:46.08
After we retreated across the Han River, my platoon was given the mission to outpost a

547
00:45:46.08 --> 00:45:48.44
long, lonely stretch of the South Bank.

548
00:45:48.44 --> 00:45:50.84
It was Christmas day.

549
00:45:50.84 --> 00:45:54.68
And although there were no Chinese inside, it wasn't a particularly jolly time.

550
00:45:54.68 --> 00:45:59.88
General Walker had been killed two days before in a freak, cheap, truck accident very similar

551
00:45:59.88 --> 00:46:04.20
to the one that had killed his former World War II boss General Patton.

552
00:46:04.20 --> 00:46:11.16
Still, paratroop general, Matt Ridgeway had taken over as the new commander of the Atharmi

553
00:46:11.16 --> 00:46:14.92
and World Wars we would retreat no further.

554
00:46:14.92 --> 00:46:18.32
It was a good word, but my platoon had a more immediate concern.

555
00:46:18.32 --> 00:46:20.80
We were starving.

556
00:46:20.80 --> 00:46:25.80
A personal recon of the area revealed a village nearby whose only occupants were a half

557
00:46:25.80 --> 00:46:31.000
a dozen scrimmagey looking chickens, one long burst from my borrowed M2 carbine gave us Christmas

558
00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:35.80
dinner in the form of three decisively dead birds that we plucked and threw on an open

559
00:46:35.80 --> 00:46:36.80
fire.

560
00:46:36.80 --> 00:46:38.72
We ate them unseasoned and undercooked.

561
00:46:38.72 --> 00:46:43.16
They were very, very raw, in fact, but wonderful to us.

562
00:46:43.16 --> 00:46:50.12
And we gobbled them down and huddled closer to the fire, thinking how lucky we were.

563
00:46:50.12 --> 00:46:55.84
No sooner had we finished than a recon company, Jeep, and trailer bounced across the field

564
00:46:55.84 --> 00:46:57.76
to our positions.

565
00:46:57.76 --> 00:47:03.48
Christmas dinner, turkey, cranberry sauce, and all the trimmings had arrived.

566
00:47:03.48 --> 00:47:05.44
Only the American army could do that.

567
00:47:05.44 --> 00:47:11.20
Unfortunately our chicken appetizer had left all of us with roaring gut aches.

568
00:47:11.20 --> 00:47:15.000
But we wolfed it down anyways because it was good because it was there and because none

569
00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:18.16
of us knew if this meal would be the last.

570
00:47:18.16 --> 00:47:21.28
The enemy took soul just after the new year.

571
00:47:21.28 --> 00:47:24.40
The bridge across the Han had been blown.

572
00:47:24.40 --> 00:47:29.72
For a few days later the chinks got a bridge head across and we once again headed south

573
00:47:29.72 --> 00:47:37.92
in zero degree weather with our tails between our legs so much for no more retreats.

574
00:47:37.92 --> 00:47:44.84
I began to think about all the general's proclamations concerning this war that we

575
00:47:44.84 --> 00:47:49.32
be home before Christmas that the Chinese would not intervene, that we'd hold here and

576
00:47:49.32 --> 00:47:50.32
we'd hold there.

577
00:47:50.32 --> 00:47:52.28
All of it was bullshit.

578
00:47:52.28 --> 00:47:56.96
And I started to wonder how they could possibly make so many dumb statements when each

579
00:47:56.96 --> 00:48:03.000
invariably fell apart when put to the test.

580
00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:07.96
Then I thought well, maybe they just don't know.

581
00:48:07.96 --> 00:48:10.44
We never saw a general on the front.

582
00:48:10.44 --> 00:48:15.48
We seldom saw a kernel, a lieutenant kernel, or a major either.

583
00:48:15.48 --> 00:48:20.52
And at the squad level we only on the rarest occasion saw a captain.

584
00:48:20.52 --> 00:48:27.20
So how could the brass know how defeated its army was if it wasn't there to see or if they

585
00:48:27.20 --> 00:48:32.84
weren't there to see an exhausted guy lie down on a road and just give up.

586
00:48:32.84 --> 00:48:39.24
How could they know how cold and ill-equipally were if they weren't there to see blue,

587
00:48:39.24 --> 00:48:44.96
gloveless hands stick to the frozen metal of weapons?

588
00:48:44.96 --> 00:48:54.84
How could they know how steep and rugged the terrain was if they never climbed a hill?

589
00:48:54.84 --> 00:48:57.68
Little leadership lesson there, massive leadership lesson there.

590
00:48:57.68 --> 00:49:02.36
You have to find out what's going on with the front line troops and you can't rely on reports

591
00:49:02.36 --> 00:49:07.56
and you know I was reading some other sections of this book.

592
00:49:07.56 --> 00:49:14.48
And the temptation to just listen to the reports of front line troops in any organization

593
00:49:14.48 --> 00:49:18.40
is a massive temptation and it's the wrong thing to do.

594
00:49:18.40 --> 00:49:22.64
Because of course, when you're in charge, of course your subordinates are going to polish

595
00:49:22.64 --> 00:49:24.24
that thing up for you.

596
00:49:24.24 --> 00:49:26.96
Make it look all good.

597
00:49:26.96 --> 00:49:27.96
Make it look all good.

598
00:49:27.96 --> 00:49:31.16
That's what they're going to do.

599
00:49:31.16 --> 00:49:32.68
You can't roll eye on that.

600
00:49:32.68 --> 00:49:36.32
You have to go down there.

601
00:49:36.32 --> 00:49:39.52
And the other thing you have to do is you have to be able to admit when you don't know

602
00:49:39.52 --> 00:49:42.12
something.

603
00:49:42.12 --> 00:49:46.36
You have to go to the front line troops, they'll polish their report.

604
00:49:46.36 --> 00:49:51.60
That's why they do it just to show like, hey, we're doing a good job now here, kind of

605
00:49:51.60 --> 00:49:56.84
thing or they don't want to get any one in trouble or like we'll be there.

606
00:49:56.84 --> 00:50:03.04
Not to go super philosophically deep on you right now, but a lack of moral courage.

607
00:50:03.04 --> 00:50:10.000
A lack of moral courage to report to your boss, my men are frozen, starving and they're

608
00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:12.08
ready to give up.

609
00:50:12.08 --> 00:50:14.04
Because what you're doing is you're, you're the leader.

610
00:50:14.04 --> 00:50:18.32
And so you're putting yourself on report for not being a good leader.

611
00:50:18.32 --> 00:50:19.32
Right?

612
00:50:19.32 --> 00:50:22.04
Because there's no bad teams only bad leaders.

613
00:50:22.04 --> 00:50:24.16
Oh, like the leader of the front line.

614
00:50:24.16 --> 00:50:25.16
So, yeah.

615
00:50:25.16 --> 00:50:29.96
So if I'm a leader on the front, if you're general echo and my guys haven't eaten and

616
00:50:29.96 --> 00:50:34.92
their morale is breaking, I don't want to tell you that.

617
00:50:34.92 --> 00:50:36.76
Because then you'll be like, well, what's wrong with you?

618
00:50:36.76 --> 00:50:37.76
How come?

619
00:50:37.76 --> 00:50:38.76
Because guess what?

620
00:50:38.76 --> 00:50:41.20
Fred over there, he's like, my men are doing great.

621
00:50:41.20 --> 00:50:44.72
Because he has no moral courage to actually tell the truth about what's happening.

622
00:50:44.72 --> 00:50:45.72
Yeah.

623
00:50:45.72 --> 00:50:47.76
And then that puts pressure on me.

624
00:50:47.76 --> 00:50:50.96
We're now I'm thinking, oh, oh, I mean, Fred's doing well.

625
00:50:50.96 --> 00:50:56.96
Maybe my guys, maybe my guys can do better and okay, you know what, general echo?

626
00:50:56.96 --> 00:50:57.96
We're fine.

627
00:50:57.96 --> 00:50:58.96
Yeah.

628
00:50:58.96 --> 00:51:00.80
Yeah, that's true.

629
00:51:00.80 --> 00:51:03.72
So it's a lack of moral courage.

630
00:51:03.72 --> 00:51:06.12
Yeah, it seems natural too now.

631
00:51:06.12 --> 00:51:07.84
Now that I'm kind of thinking and I like that.

632
00:51:07.84 --> 00:51:12.08
Of course, yeah, if you're in charge of the guys over there, you don't want to be like,

633
00:51:12.08 --> 00:51:15.08
yeah, we're not doing good.

634
00:51:15.08 --> 00:51:16.08
Yeah.

635
00:51:16.08 --> 00:51:18.88
Even like, it's kind of seems like even in like social scenarios.

636
00:51:18.88 --> 00:51:19.88
Oh, for sure.

637
00:51:19.88 --> 00:51:20.88
Sure.

638
00:51:20.88 --> 00:51:22.48
Like, hey, so how's that?

639
00:51:22.48 --> 00:51:26.28
How's Mary Dlyne for, I don't know, whatever the situation is?

640
00:51:26.28 --> 00:51:29.32
And you want to be like, oh, I'm struggling through this Mary Dlyne.

641
00:51:29.32 --> 00:51:31.88
Kind of thing like you just like, you don't want to say that.

642
00:51:31.88 --> 00:51:33.88
If in fact, you're struggling through Mary Dlyne.

643
00:51:33.88 --> 00:51:34.88
I'm just saying.

644
00:51:34.88 --> 00:51:37.52
Yeah, it seems like, yeah, that seems a lot more natural.

645
00:51:37.52 --> 00:51:42.52
Yeah, obviously, to happen in the business world too, because, you know, the, oh,

646
00:51:42.52 --> 00:51:44.76
Echo, how's your sales going with your sales team down there?

647
00:51:44.76 --> 00:51:45.76
Yeah.

648
00:51:45.76 --> 00:51:48.000
You know, you don't want to say what's not going very well, because you're putting

649
00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:52.56
yourself on report for failing because you are the leader.

650
00:51:52.56 --> 00:51:57.44
But if there's stuff, what you should say, what you should say is, hey, boss, here's

651
00:51:57.44 --> 00:51:59.68
what's going on.

652
00:51:59.68 --> 00:52:02.36
My troops, they're over fatigue right now.

653
00:52:02.36 --> 00:52:06.80
We need food and we need some warm weather gear, because at look, there's some

654
00:52:06.80 --> 00:52:10.24
motivate, there's some motivated guys that want to make it happen.

655
00:52:10.24 --> 00:52:14.68
But when they can't even load their weapon because their skin is freezing to the

656
00:52:14.68 --> 00:52:18.44
bullets, that is a problem.

657
00:52:18.44 --> 00:52:21.36
A problem that no amount of motivation can cure.

658
00:52:21.36 --> 00:52:22.36
We need gloves.

659
00:52:22.36 --> 00:52:24.16
Like that kind of thing.

660
00:52:24.16 --> 00:52:26.04
You have to be able to frame it correctly.

661
00:52:26.04 --> 00:52:27.04
Yeah.

662
00:52:31.72 --> 00:52:36.20
Back to the book, still we kept retreating, exchanging ground for time.

663
00:52:36.20 --> 00:52:39.16
We were always cold, always hungry, always tired.

664
00:52:39.16 --> 00:52:40.52
We were also filthy.

665
00:52:40.52 --> 00:52:42.96
It was too cold to even consider washing.

666
00:52:42.96 --> 00:52:46.20
So we got to sue Juan and found ourselves with a few days to rest.

667
00:52:46.20 --> 00:52:50.44
We decided to take that abandoned city by storm as in Seoul.

668
00:52:50.44 --> 00:52:52.88
Everyone had left sue Juan and a great hurry.

669
00:52:52.88 --> 00:52:56.40
So we could pretty well help ourselves to whatever we needed.

670
00:52:56.40 --> 00:52:58.04
My section took over a house.

671
00:52:58.04 --> 00:53:02.08
We scrounge around and found an old fashioned Korean bath.

672
00:53:02.08 --> 00:53:06.000
One of those stand-up jobs about Chastai with a wood furnace beneath it.

673
00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:09.92
We filled the tub, built a rowing fire, and one by one jumped in.

674
00:53:09.92 --> 00:53:12.80
Each of us skimming the other guys dirt off the top of the water.

675
00:53:12.80 --> 00:53:14.20
I was last.

676
00:53:14.20 --> 00:53:16.08
The water was almost black by then.

677
00:53:16.08 --> 00:53:18.88
We all kinds of crud floating around, but I didn't care.

678
00:53:18.88 --> 00:53:20.52
I might not have gotten clean.

679
00:53:20.52 --> 00:53:23.52
But for the first time in weeks I was warm.

680
00:53:23.52 --> 00:53:27.68
Just after we left Suwan, my platoon was ordered to establish a night blocking position

681
00:53:27.68 --> 00:53:32.24
to stride a north-south road that paralleled a railroad track.

682
00:53:32.24 --> 00:53:37.40
The scout section in rifle squad were set up in a defensive line that ran from the road

683
00:53:37.40 --> 00:53:40.88
through a rice paddy and onto a railroad trussle.

684
00:53:40.88 --> 00:53:45.000
Our machine gun was set up on the trussle pointing straight down the tracks.

685
00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:50.64
A little high ground, where it could put plunging fire directly in front of deployed

686
00:53:50.64 --> 00:53:53.72
troops and flanking fire on the road 50 yards away.

687
00:53:53.72 --> 00:54:00.44
Our platoon leader stayed with the 2M-24 tanks on the road behind him was the 81 millimeter

688
00:54:00.44 --> 00:54:01.88
mortar squad.

689
00:54:01.88 --> 00:54:03.88
It was late at night, almost quiet.

690
00:54:03.88 --> 00:54:08.40
We were locked in cocked and pros at this deadly delaying game now.

691
00:54:08.40 --> 00:54:12.88
I moved between positions, having whispered conversations with the guys.

692
00:54:12.88 --> 00:54:17.80
It was a habit I had to keep myself awake and make sure the men stayed awake too.

693
00:54:17.80 --> 00:54:24.04
I was at the machine gun which was manned by a stud of a Hawaiian trooper named Sheldon

694
00:54:24.04 --> 00:54:26.52
when we saw the enemy coming.

695
00:54:26.52 --> 00:54:30.80
There was at least a company and maybe more behind for a breast double timing quietly

696
00:54:30.80 --> 00:54:32.68
down the railroad track.

697
00:54:32.68 --> 00:54:37.80
When they were no more than 50 yards from the machine gun, Sheldon left loose along

698
00:54:37.80 --> 00:54:41.60
bursts that cut a wide swath into their unsuspecting ranks.

699
00:54:41.60 --> 00:54:45.60
A burst of machine gun fire was the signal for the infantry tanks and orders to join

700
00:54:45.60 --> 00:54:46.60
the fray.

701
00:54:46.60 --> 00:54:50.48
The scout section of rifle squad immediately poured fire into the enemy formation.

702
00:54:50.48 --> 00:54:51.72
The enemy panicked.

703
00:54:51.72 --> 00:54:54.88
They did not fire one round and return.

704
00:54:54.88 --> 00:54:59.44
Instead they broke ranks and high-tailed it to the rice paddy, running right into the rifle

705
00:54:59.44 --> 00:55:01.20
squad's grazing fire.

706
00:55:01.20 --> 00:55:02.56
It was great to see.

707
00:55:02.56 --> 00:55:06.72
We were cleaning the clock of an enemy force at least 10 times our size.

708
00:55:06.72 --> 00:55:11.80
Like young rommel did, I thought, in 1914 when he ambushed and destroyed almost a complete

709
00:55:11.80 --> 00:55:17.56
British rifle company with a handful of soldiers simply by using initiative and surprise

710
00:55:17.56 --> 00:55:20.96
two of the key elements in battle.

711
00:55:20.96 --> 00:55:25.52
The mortar was plopping rounds of high explosives right on top of the confused reds.

712
00:55:25.52 --> 00:55:30.92
Meanwhile our tanks main guns which were loaded with anti-personnel grapeshot hadn't

713
00:55:30.92 --> 00:55:33.60
fired anything at all.

714
00:55:33.60 --> 00:55:38.08
A white star cluster flitter popped and hovered over our positions.

715
00:55:38.08 --> 00:55:43.40
This was our signal to beat feet in retreat and we didn't need a second invitation.

716
00:55:43.40 --> 00:55:50.96
We scrambled to waiting vehicles and quickly moved to and through US lines.

717
00:55:50.96 --> 00:55:57.44
We'd taken no casualties but I still couldn't understand why the tanks guns hadn't fired.

718
00:55:57.44 --> 00:56:00.48
The enemy had been hurt badly but not destroyed.

719
00:56:00.48 --> 00:56:05.68
If those tank guns had been employed we've completely wiped them out.

720
00:56:05.68 --> 00:56:11.04
The sun was coming up as the platoon pulled into the abandoned chonin school yard that served

721
00:56:11.04 --> 00:56:12.96
as the base for recon company.

722
00:56:12.96 --> 00:56:18.60
I went over to our platoon sergeant Anne and asked him why the tanks hadn't been used.

723
00:56:18.60 --> 00:56:23.52
He looked away and sort of bowed his head as if he was embarrassed which was very strange

724
00:56:23.52 --> 00:56:28.32
behavior for this rugged, highly decorated warrior.

725
00:56:28.32 --> 00:56:31.72
Better see the lieutenant young sergeant.

726
00:56:31.72 --> 00:56:33.32
Why didn't the tanks fire?

727
00:56:33.32 --> 00:56:36.92
I asked my regular army platoon leader moments later.

728
00:56:36.92 --> 00:56:40.92
I didn't want to give our positions away he replied.

729
00:56:40.92 --> 00:56:43.40
I couldn't believe it.

730
00:56:43.40 --> 00:56:44.96
Give your positions away.

731
00:56:44.96 --> 00:56:46.96
Bullshit I cried.

732
00:56:46.96 --> 00:56:50.40
The sergeant didn't talk to officers like that but I didn't care.

733
00:56:50.40 --> 00:56:55.72
We had the closest thing to a glorious victory that I'd seen that tanks stuck their

734
00:56:55.72 --> 00:57:00.32
noses into this goddamn war that I'd seen since the tanks stuck their noses into this

735
00:57:00.32 --> 00:57:06.68
goddamn war and now this pissant weak lieutenant you were just too yellow to do your

736
00:57:06.68 --> 00:57:07.68
job.

737
00:57:07.68 --> 00:57:11.28
I shouted and stormed back into my scout section in a rage.

738
00:57:11.28 --> 00:57:13.64
I grabbed my pack and rifle.

739
00:57:13.64 --> 00:57:18.68
I'm leaving this outfit right now I told my platoon sergeant I'm not waiting for orders.

740
00:57:18.68 --> 00:57:20.68
I'm going a wall.

741
00:57:20.68 --> 00:57:26.24
I came here to fight not play hide and seek and where I come from officers like you've

742
00:57:26.24 --> 00:57:31.40
got here would have been drummed right out of the officers corps.

743
00:57:31.40 --> 00:57:36.12
With that I headed for the road.

744
00:57:36.12 --> 00:57:38.08
So that's just mayhem right.

745
00:57:38.08 --> 00:57:43.56
They don't actively assault the enemy with all the firepower that they had.

746
00:57:43.56 --> 00:57:45.64
The guard gets pissed off.

747
00:57:45.64 --> 00:57:46.84
So he goes a wall.

748
00:57:46.84 --> 00:57:50.28
Now normally absent without leave what someone's trying to do is they're trying to

749
00:57:50.28 --> 00:57:51.28
share responsibility.

750
00:57:51.28 --> 00:57:54.60
You know they're a hippie or they're a bum and they're trying to get out of there.

751
00:57:54.60 --> 00:57:57.12
They're they're what for whatever reason they're trying to leave.

752
00:57:57.12 --> 00:57:59.08
They're trying to get away from the army.

753
00:57:59.08 --> 00:58:05.04
He's going a wall because he wants to fight more.

754
00:58:05.04 --> 00:58:12.04
There was an expression in there and I've heard it before their ranks like he referred to

755
00:58:12.04 --> 00:58:16.12
like we shot bullets into their ranks and then they broke rank.

756
00:58:16.12 --> 00:58:17.12
Like what?

757
00:58:17.12 --> 00:58:23.56
A simple information type thing lined up which is crazy to think about.

758
00:58:23.56 --> 00:58:30.36
It's crazy to think about in modern war a group of individuals being in ranks.

759
00:58:30.36 --> 00:58:33.96
So in ranks is like you know for across and whatever 30 deep that's the rank.

760
00:58:33.96 --> 00:58:39.44
It's a specific formation of some lengths or is it just sort of just them over there

761
00:58:39.44 --> 00:58:40.44
in that whatever.

762
00:58:40.44 --> 00:58:46.92
I mean the fact that he's saying in ranks means that they're in a legitimate formation.

763
00:58:46.92 --> 00:58:50.000
You know they're probably moving down this road.

764
00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:53.56
They don't think there's any Americans there to interfere with them.

765
00:58:53.56 --> 00:58:57.24
So they're just in ranks walking because it's an efficient way to walk.

766
00:58:57.24 --> 00:58:58.80
But it's not an efficient way to fight.

767
00:58:58.80 --> 00:59:00.68
Yeah, it doesn't seem like you.

768
00:59:00.68 --> 00:59:04.76
It's an efficient way to get mode down by machine gun which is exactly what happened.

769
00:59:04.76 --> 00:59:06.80
Yes, I could see that.

770
00:59:06.80 --> 00:59:10.40
Well yeah and so when they broke ranks they all ran in different directions.

771
00:59:10.40 --> 00:59:11.64
Yeah, you know.

772
00:59:11.64 --> 00:59:15.92
So well let me ask you this as far as just in the spirit of understanding what that means.

773
00:59:15.92 --> 00:59:17.96
Because it sounds real cool in my opinion.

774
00:59:17.96 --> 00:59:20.36
Like I could just be throwing out that expression.

775
00:59:20.36 --> 00:59:24.68
Sometimes the time not in a military sense but you know I don't know.

776
00:59:24.68 --> 00:59:27.64
Well they do use it in a non-military sense.

777
00:59:27.64 --> 00:59:33.16
Let's say there's 20 people and we're we come up with a plan and we're going to go forward

778
00:59:33.16 --> 00:59:36.16
with this new plan and then echo decides it's going to do something different.

779
00:59:36.16 --> 00:59:37.16
There's an expression.

780
00:59:37.16 --> 00:59:38.72
Oh echo just broke ranks.

781
00:59:38.72 --> 00:59:42.80
Oh okay yeah, exactly right and that's kind of what I was sort of trying to figure out.

782
00:59:42.80 --> 00:59:44.16
Like could I use it in that way?

783
00:59:44.16 --> 00:59:45.16
Yes you can.

784
00:59:45.16 --> 00:59:49.92
Because it sounds really cool when instead of like oh yeah I just started shooting at all

785
00:59:49.92 --> 00:59:55.64
of them you know I shot into their ranks you know like that sounds way cooler.

786
00:59:55.64 --> 01:00:03.12
But so could it be even loosely used in an official on an official situation of just

787
01:00:03.12 --> 01:00:05.28
a group of people there you know.

788
01:00:05.28 --> 01:00:06.28
Yeah.

789
01:00:06.28 --> 01:00:07.28
Right like they weren't.

790
01:00:07.28 --> 01:00:10.96
That's a little bit necessarily in a specific formation but they were over there.

791
01:00:10.96 --> 01:00:13.80
I would say that was a bunch of people.

792
01:00:13.80 --> 01:00:14.80
Yeah.

793
01:00:14.80 --> 01:00:16.40
I would say that was a crowd of people.

794
01:00:16.40 --> 01:00:17.40
Right right.

795
01:00:17.40 --> 01:00:20.84
You say there's a bunch of people in ranks.

796
01:00:20.84 --> 01:00:21.84
They're organized.

797
01:00:21.84 --> 01:00:22.84
Yeah.

798
01:00:22.84 --> 01:00:27.52
Well could they be interpreted as organized you know like you know the kind where those two

799
01:00:27.52 --> 01:00:31.72
guys let's say not military maybe like I don't know your friends in the neighborhood and

800
01:00:31.72 --> 01:00:33.12
you don't like them you know.

801
01:00:33.12 --> 01:00:36.04
They're a bunch of cousins or whatever you don't like them.

802
01:00:36.04 --> 01:00:39.80
And they're over there on the corner right and you have maybe you and your brother whatever

803
01:00:39.80 --> 01:00:43.68
right you guys don't like them they don't like you whatever and then you see them over

804
01:00:43.68 --> 01:00:47.72
there on the corner assembled not for any specific reason but they're together you

805
01:00:47.72 --> 01:00:53.16
know could you could you in theory refer to them as on the corner in ranks in theory

806
01:00:53.16 --> 01:00:54.84
yes you could but it wouldn't be accurate.

807
01:00:54.84 --> 01:00:56.56
Two people is not going to court look.

808
01:00:56.56 --> 01:00:58.60
No the cousins let's say there's five.

809
01:00:58.60 --> 01:00:59.60
Five cousins.

810
01:00:59.60 --> 01:01:03.28
Even five you're it's going to have a hard time getting you know being in ranks

811
01:01:03.28 --> 01:01:08.04
not not to me they're in ranks so you're asking me for permission to use this word and

812
01:01:08.04 --> 01:01:10.88
then you're just what I tell you know you're just doing it anyways.

813
01:01:10.88 --> 01:01:16.56
Yes sir cool say whatever you want to say it's your you're the one that's going to look.

814
01:01:16.56 --> 01:01:17.92
You're the one that's going to look dumb.

815
01:01:17.92 --> 01:01:22.80
And I didn't want to say it but like this is where we're at and you sounded like you

816
01:01:22.80 --> 01:01:27.72
really did want to say it but if I had to if I pause if those guys the right thing

817
01:01:27.72 --> 01:01:32.28
you do call my friend dumb well I guess it is my friend wants to act dumb he's going to

818
01:01:32.28 --> 01:01:36.56
get called up in the interest decide what you're going to call something look if there's

819
01:01:36.56 --> 01:01:43.04
five cousins on the corner altogether cruising and me and my brother start running

820
01:01:43.04 --> 01:01:48.44
at them aggressively and they scatter they broke ranks okay I'll do that there you go

821
01:01:48.44 --> 01:01:52.000
so then now I guess I'm done because they you know don't have to be in some form of

822
01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:58.88
ranks yeah so I just I look at this is like an understanding process do you understand

823
01:01:58.88 --> 01:02:06.20
this area do thank you I'm not even sure I understand so hack worth goes a wall

824
01:02:06.20 --> 01:02:12.000
because he wants to fight more back to the book any man who's wild enough to go

825
01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:16.84
a wall to fight is just a kind of man we want our outfit said captain John Paul

826
01:02:16.84 --> 01:02:21.40
van when I stopped at his eighth Ranger camp fresh from my breakfast out of the

827
01:02:21.40 --> 01:02:26.72
25th Recon company the eighth Rangers was a great spirit at outfit recently rebuilt

828
01:02:26.72 --> 01:02:31.40
after being decimated the night the Chinese entered the war after I'd explain my

829
01:02:31.40 --> 01:02:35.92
situation the whole outfit accepted me with open arms the Rangers were elite

830
01:02:35.92 --> 01:02:41.60
troops four runners of the special forces their mission was raids long reconnaissance

831
01:02:41.60 --> 01:02:45.68
patrols ambushes and other special jobs that conventional troops were not

832
01:02:45.68 --> 01:02:49.92
trained to handle their history went back to Rogers Rangers before the

833
01:02:49.92 --> 01:02:54.80
Revolutionary War during World War II there've been six Ranger battalions whose

834
01:02:54.80 --> 01:03:00.24
brave and daring feats are unmatched to this day historically such all volunteer

835
01:03:00.24 --> 01:03:05.92
specific specially trained units had been misused task either with impossible

836
01:03:05.92 --> 01:03:11.44
missions for organizations their size or placed with palace guard combat duties

837
01:03:11.44 --> 01:03:16.52
well beneath their skill and ability when I arrived at the eighth Ranger camp the

838
01:03:16.52 --> 01:03:21.80
unit was chasing guerrillas behind the main lines morale was high and the guys

839
01:03:21.80 --> 01:03:27.56
were spoiling for a good fight but during the time I was there there was nothing

840
01:03:27.56 --> 01:03:32.60
much to my way of thinking anyway that seemed to be happening I was impatient

841
01:03:32.60 --> 01:03:37.52
to get in the thick of it and as proud as I was to be a Ranger guerrilla hunting

842
01:03:37.52 --> 01:03:44.32
was not my idea of infantry combat little did I know then the starring roles

843
01:03:44.32 --> 01:03:49.08
that guerrilla hunting and Ranger seal John Paul van would have later in my

844
01:03:49.08 --> 01:03:54.32
life besides the word was that the eighth Rangers was going to be broken up

845
01:03:54.32 --> 01:03:59.92
soon and something in me said to move on so I did until I saw a sign by a road

846
01:03:59.92 --> 01:04:05.64
that proclaimed wolf-hound right-white rear well if that's not a guarantee for a

847
01:04:05.64 --> 01:04:10.20
good fight I don't know what is I thought and high-tailed it to the battalion

848
01:04:10.20 --> 01:04:16.68
CP the 27th Infantry Wolf-Hound Regiment was a colorful unit itself the

849
01:04:16.68 --> 01:04:20.12
outfit had gotten his name during a stint in fighting the communist in

850
01:04:20.12 --> 01:04:25.000
Siberia during the Russian Revolution and Korea the wolf-hounds were known as

851
01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:30.44
the fire brigade because whenever there was trouble they were sent into save the

852
01:04:30.44 --> 01:04:36.20
day they weren't a special unit just a group of guys who thought they were good

853
01:04:36.20 --> 01:04:41.44
so they were good I had to highlight that because I just teaches you something

854
01:04:41.44 --> 01:04:46.96
about leadership and about morale and about attitude and about a speed of core you

855
01:04:46.96 --> 01:04:50.80
get guys and you convince them that they're good and they think they're good they

856
01:04:50.80 --> 01:04:56.16
get good they become good I'd see members of the outfit regularly over the last

857
01:04:56.16 --> 01:05:02.28
months whenever the 25th Recon had sent their portions of the division was sent

858
01:05:02.28 --> 01:05:06.56
I've been sent their portion of the divisional front and I'd always been knocked out

859
01:05:06.56 --> 01:05:12.08
by the because these guys acted more like pirates on the high seas than as a

860
01:05:12.08 --> 01:05:17.04
regular army regiment to begin with the wolf-hounds were their regimental crust

861
01:05:17.04 --> 01:05:21.28
crest on their fatigues like their metal of honor their spirit was just

862
01:05:21.28 --> 01:05:26.48
incredible they were so totally non-military in terms of what I was a custom to

863
01:05:26.48 --> 01:05:32.08
they seldom wore steel pots they modified their gear to make it more functional

864
01:05:32.08 --> 01:05:36.88
and simply got rid of things that weighed them down unnecessarily along wooden

865
01:05:36.88 --> 01:05:40.88
handle of the entrenching tool for example was caught off so it wouldn't rub against

866
01:05:40.88 --> 01:05:45.12
your leg the packs were thrown away and you carried a tramp's rule which was

867
01:05:45.12 --> 01:05:49.92
quickly grounded when you got into a fight BARs were stripped of bypods and

868
01:05:49.92 --> 01:05:54.32
carrying handles and scabbards were tossed with the bayonet living permanently at

869
01:05:54.32 --> 01:05:59.36
the end of the rifle grenades were carried in canteen covers you could fit five and

870
01:05:59.36 --> 01:06:06.08
if you wanted to carry a captured weapon go for it so these guys are got a little

871
01:06:07.12 --> 01:06:10.96
little bit of rebellion in them got a little rebellious attitude which is a good thing

872
01:06:12.40 --> 01:06:18.56
got to be balanced but it's a good thing this renegade kind of soldering was not only sanctioned

873
01:06:18.56 --> 01:06:25.28
but encouraged by the twenty-seven's regimental commander and fire chief world war two

874
01:06:25.28 --> 01:06:34.32
paratrooper Colonel John iron-micolus Michaelus who would go on to four stars understood

875
01:06:34.32 --> 01:06:41.84
what made men fight he was known from morale boosting slogans like your lean your

876
01:06:41.84 --> 01:06:46.88
mean your rough your tough your professional killers and pre-battle pep talks like

877
01:06:47.60 --> 01:06:51.12
you're not here to die for your country you're here to make those other so-and-so is

878
01:06:51.12 --> 01:06:56.64
die for theirs the wolf hounds prad proud combat record showed that they believed him

879
01:06:57.76 --> 01:07:03.68
and they'd eagerly adopted their commanders no nonsense brand of soldering i was more than ready to do

880
01:07:03.68 --> 01:07:11.76
the same the second battalion's exo pointed the way up the road to where the rifle companies were deployed

881
01:07:11.76 --> 01:07:17.68
the first unit i came to is company g where i reported to first sergeant Edwin rager

882
01:07:17.68 --> 01:07:26.72
i can always use another sergeant this giant of a top kick roard then and there he assigned me

883
01:07:26.72 --> 01:07:31.92
to third puttune finally with the assurance that i'd be picked up on the morning report so i

884
01:07:31.92 --> 01:07:39.92
wouldn't be considered a walther a or mma i joined my new family at first it was not the happiest

885
01:07:39.92 --> 01:07:46.64
of unions i should have realized it wouldn't be easy it's always a bitch to join a unit particularly

886
01:07:46.64 --> 01:07:52.16
one as tight as the wolf hounds as an individual replacement and for some reason it's even worse

887
01:07:52.16 --> 01:07:58.72
when you're an nco or an officer you don't know anyone and no one trusts you until you've proved

888
01:07:58.72 --> 01:08:04.56
yourself in battle you get all the lousy details and only the worst battlefield horror stories

889
01:08:05.36 --> 01:08:12.24
you're just the new guy you're just fresh meat and add insult to injury though i'd been a squad leader

890
01:08:12.24 --> 01:08:19.04
in acting platoon sergeant in in Italy and a sex and leader in the 25th recon now in the in the

891
01:08:19.04 --> 01:08:26.64
third of the g i found myself an assistant squad leader i was damned unhappy with the

892
01:08:26.64 --> 01:08:32.80
emotion i probably had more non-com experience than any of the squad leaders in the platoon but the

893
01:08:32.80 --> 01:08:38.96
fact was that in their eyes i was untried and all protests the contrary fell on deaf ears

894
01:08:38.96 --> 01:08:45.04
doesn't matter who you are hack worth checking into a new unit got to prove yourself

895
01:08:46.08 --> 01:08:51.68
it didn't help i didn't help my cause that any that evening soon after my arrival when just

896
01:08:51.68 --> 01:08:57.36
at dusk i got caught in a right in a rice paddy right smack dab in the middle of a blistering

897
01:08:57.36 --> 01:09:02.64
chink mortar attack i started to run but slipped and fell in the patty when i finally got back to

898
01:09:02.64 --> 01:09:08.000
my foxhole i discovered that my water repellent outer trousers were covered with human shit

899
01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:14.48
which the Koreans used for fertilizer on surprisingly the guy sharing my whole was unhappy about this

900
01:09:14.48 --> 01:09:20.16
as i was i took off the trousers and made due for the night with two pairs of long johns

901
01:09:20.16 --> 01:09:27.36
and two pairs of OD trousers i had on an underneath then i sat out until it was my turn to go on

902
01:09:27.36 --> 01:09:33.36
guard leaving my foxhole partner to contend with the lingering aroma of my accident guard was

903
01:09:33.36 --> 01:09:39.52
grew a grueling ritual mainly because everyone was so tired each squad had its own sector

904
01:09:39.52 --> 01:09:48.40
normally four foxholes each about four yards apart the two guys shared a hole and took turns

905
01:09:48.40 --> 01:09:53.12
throughout the night searching into the darkness you'd look until you got tired then glance at your

906
01:09:53.12 --> 01:09:59.52
buddy sacked out at the bottom of the hole then you'd look a little longer until while you thought

907
01:09:59.52 --> 01:10:07.12
should i wake him now has he had enough sleep few guys had a watch us to own a watch in an infantry

908
01:10:07.12 --> 01:10:13.36
squad during the first Korean winter was a luxury beyond imagination so you spelled each other

909
01:10:13.36 --> 01:10:17.92
based on the honor system and you only asked for relief when it was impossible to keep your eyes

910
01:10:17.92 --> 01:10:25.36
open any longer then your buddy would ask for a sit rep and that was it you'd be a sleep

911
01:10:25.36 --> 01:10:32.56
almost before you'd zipped up your feather down fart sack that's what they call a sleeping

912
01:10:32.56 --> 01:10:38.24
bags if you didn't pick that up the last time i used it guys didn't have watches

913
01:10:40.72 --> 01:10:46.80
what's happening i asked when my foxhole partner woke me from my turn not a thing he replied

914
01:10:46.80 --> 01:10:51.52
and he was out like a light still inside my sack i sat in the darkness in the edge of the hole

915
01:10:51.52 --> 01:10:56.64
got my eyeballs unglued and tried to remember where i was i was fantasizing about smoking a cigarette

916
01:10:56.64 --> 01:11:03.36
drinking a hot cup of coffee eating a charcoal black rare steak and getting a squad of my own

917
01:11:03.36 --> 01:11:11.52
wind to my amazement i saw man lying prone immediately to my immediate left rear i woke up my buddy

918
01:11:11.52 --> 01:11:17.52
there's a goddamn shake almost on top of us we whispered through our options we could toss a grenade

919
01:11:17.52 --> 01:11:22.40
blasting with a rifle or crawl out and getting with a knife we decided on the third alternative

920
01:11:22.40 --> 01:11:27.36
because the guy who's right in the middle of our squad position and rifle fire or a grenade

921
01:11:27.36 --> 01:11:34.08
could easily start a firefight among our own guys the chink wasn't moving and his back was

922
01:11:34.08 --> 01:11:39.92
to us my buddy covered me while i crawled out of the foxhole with my trusty m1 and ten inch

923
01:11:39.92 --> 01:11:45.68
razor sharp bayonet attached i crouched in a crouched position i silently slipped up behind

924
01:11:45.68 --> 01:11:51.36
the enemy soldier when i got within sticking distance i drew my rifle and thrust it with full force

925
01:11:53.52 --> 01:11:59.92
branches crackled and it was over i'd bayonet in my own frozen stiff trousers which i'd

926
01:11:59.92 --> 01:12:04.96
earlier hung over a bush behind our foxhole to dry the next morning i had to put the shitty things

927
01:12:04.96 --> 01:12:10.72
back on again now with a hole in the ass as well and for some reason the fresh meat was the only

928
01:12:10.72 --> 01:12:16.24
one in the squad who didn't think this was very funny so that's how he that's that's the impression

929
01:12:16.24 --> 01:12:22.24
he makes his freaking stabbing his own pants and it's own shit covered pants in the middle of the night

930
01:12:23.52 --> 01:12:29.68
being a new guy as hard yeah it seems like it being a new guy as hard being a new guy is very hard

931
01:12:30.24 --> 01:12:39.28
you cannot you cannot do these kind of things socks when you do everyone's watching you you know

932
01:12:39.28 --> 01:12:43.68
kind of when you're a new guy kind of kind of back off a little bit you know what i'm saying

933
01:12:43.68 --> 01:12:49.52
you like just take take a wrap off yeah that whole first impression thing just in general

934
01:12:49.52 --> 01:12:55.68
yeah because like the new guy you don't have any evaluation criteria like there's no like you didn't

935
01:12:55.68 --> 01:12:59.52
you're not judged on anything because you don't have anything you know and then you start doing

936
01:12:59.52 --> 01:13:05.52
these weirdo things having your pants you're like okay well that's the how this guy is he steps

937
01:13:05.52 --> 01:13:09.92
his own pants in the dark sometimes like yeah so yeah you're weird you're weird and then so

938
01:13:09.92 --> 01:13:14.16
now you got to kind of make up for all that stuff by doing a bunch of awesome stuff you know

939
01:13:14.16 --> 01:13:20.48
but i guess even beyond that look okay so let's admit that it's hard but i guess what i'm saying

940
01:13:20.48 --> 01:13:27.04
is air on the side of not doing dumb shit you know what i'm saying like if there's something

941
01:13:27.04 --> 01:13:33.04
i could maybe do this and it might make me look good but just think about you know once again

942
01:13:33.04 --> 01:13:38.48
be negative when you plan be negative when you plan think yourself you know that might make me look

943
01:13:38.48 --> 01:13:45.84
might make me look cool but also if this goes sideways it's gonna look real dumb have you ever

944
01:13:45.84 --> 01:13:53.44
seen like fail videos yeah sir right yes very often yeah i mean those are a legitimate thing

945
01:13:53.44 --> 01:13:59.76
right yeah yeah in the addiction by the way so how many of those people in the five seconds

946
01:13:59.76 --> 01:14:05.36
before they attempt their whatever they're attempting how many of those people are actually thinking

947
01:14:05.36 --> 01:14:11.04
this is gonna look real good yeah yeah so there's there's two of them there's one girl one

948
01:14:11.04 --> 01:14:16.08
guy and then the same thing so it's like oh yeah i'm gonna jump in this icy pond yeah you know with

949
01:14:16.08 --> 01:14:21.60
my the guy obviously has his swimsuit on the girl and his swimsuit whatever they're two separate

950
01:14:21.60 --> 01:14:25.92
videos is one same but the same thing so they go you know the girls like oh my god come to you

951
01:14:25.92 --> 01:14:30.08
for this type of action to spread this is where the whole world wins right now

952
01:14:32.08 --> 01:14:37.44
this is the ultimate failed video yeah so one of them for sure they they're endless and then i love

953
01:14:37.44 --> 01:14:43.20
them but you know great lessons in these videos you know so yeah now we're talking about

954
01:14:43.20 --> 01:14:48.72
freaking philosophical lessons we get from failed videos yes i brought it up they go deep i brought it

955
01:14:48.72 --> 01:14:55.76
up yes yeah i'm guilty yeah so you know the girls like hey okay ready the guy in the camera

956
01:14:55.76 --> 01:15:01.28
may or may not be in on it whatever says okay one two three go the girl jumps off this little

957
01:15:01.28 --> 01:15:06.24
pier which is you know maybe two three three feet down into the water the icy water right and the

958
01:15:06.24 --> 01:15:11.44
ice is just so thick that it doesn't even break so she just like god slams on to the ice

959
01:15:11.44 --> 01:15:17.52
so you can really badly her oh yeah that's the thing it's like that's the you can break your neck

960
01:15:17.52 --> 01:15:23.04
yeah are you back or you're teleporting oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah you can break the neck a lot diving

961
01:15:23.04 --> 01:15:31.60
into shallow pools you know water pond water yeah luckily they they weren't trying to dive in

962
01:15:31.60 --> 01:15:36.56
they're just getting all okay cool yeah i feel a little better about it now yeah i don't think

963
01:15:37.52 --> 01:15:42.96
that wouldn't be a good idea even if it was thin ice to like dive that's like some next level like

964
01:15:42.96 --> 01:15:49.52
hot smart that's the next level fail yes sir but no you can still get hurt imagine jumping off

965
01:15:49.52 --> 01:15:56.32
this table onto concrete slippery con that's essentially what it is you know yeah so you mean ice yeah

966
01:15:57.52 --> 01:16:02.40
let's check the ice slippery con doesn't break doesn't crack and here's the thing i'm assuming

967
01:16:02.40 --> 01:16:08.40
they didn't get injured i'm sure it hurt for sure on a couple levels but when you watch it it's real

968
01:16:08.40 --> 01:16:13.68
funny because you think they're gonna like do like a cannonball whatever and it's like it's real funny but

969
01:16:14.48 --> 01:16:18.64
yeah man it's that thing if you're the new guy and that's what you do it's like man yeah you're the

970
01:16:18.64 --> 01:16:24.56
guy who jumped on that ice and like jam yourself up you know yeah just kind of reassess in those

971
01:16:24.56 --> 01:16:29.44
five seconds before you're about to do something just think and look i'm not saying you don't have

972
01:16:29.44 --> 01:16:34.88
to have courage you gotta try things you know but just think maybe this isn't gonna quite

973
01:16:34.88 --> 01:16:41.28
turn out the way i wanted it to yeah and chance that this goes a little bit wrong and if you're a

974
01:16:41.28 --> 01:16:47.44
new guy you don't have that much leadership capital to spend on recovering from this yeah so just

975
01:16:47.44 --> 01:16:58.24
I'm got a grisks and sense back to the book the war seemed lost at best it was hopelessly confused

976
01:16:58.24 --> 01:17:06.24
i'd thought wars at least American wars had happy endings like capturing Berlin and Tokyo

977
01:17:06.24 --> 01:17:12.56
all we were doing was yo-yoing back and forth across the Korean peninsula defeat the victory

978
01:17:12.56 --> 01:17:18.56
then defeat and defeat with g company two we were retreating shuffling along heading south cold

979
01:17:18.56 --> 01:17:24.88
or sometimes the temperatures were 20 degrees below zero and more tired than we'd ever been in our

980
01:17:24.88 --> 01:17:31.36
lives one day a snap-fall had us waiting through mud on both sides of a mire that had once been

981
01:17:31.36 --> 01:17:36.56
a road jieps and trucks slosh through it to each vehicle trying and vain to miss the

982
01:17:36.56 --> 01:17:42.000
rudder the vehicle in front so it's not become bogged down one jeep stalled and would not restart just as

983
01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:47.92
our column was passing by the driver in lieutenant passenger unass the thing the lieutenant

984
01:17:47.92 --> 01:17:52.96
called for help to push it over to the side but before we could slosh through the quagmire and give

985
01:17:52.96 --> 01:18:00.32
him a hand he whipped out his pistol and aimed at one of the tires i figured his daddy must have

986
01:18:00.32 --> 01:18:05.52
been an old horse soldier and hit this guy was going to follow through with the cab tradition of

987
01:18:05.52 --> 01:18:12.72
shooting his disabled mount and for sure pal pal pal but the last shot missed the tire it

988
01:18:12.72 --> 01:18:18.72
glanced off the rim and boomerang back to strike the lieutenant right between the eyes we push the

989
01:18:18.72 --> 01:18:24.08
jeep and the warm still body off the road and then return to our column soon the temperature

990
01:18:24.08 --> 01:18:29.36
dropped the road turned to ice and we just kept heading south that hadn't met anything

991
01:18:29.36 --> 01:18:36.08
through the lieutenant's death for openers what he done was dumb but more than that we'd become a

992
01:18:36.08 --> 01:18:42.80
moon fighting a war on the ground is like a working in a slaughterhouse at first the blood the

993
01:18:42.80 --> 01:18:48.16
gore gets to you but after a while you don't see it you don't smell it you don't feel it

994
01:18:48.80 --> 01:18:56.08
so what's another dead body it's almost as if you don't care in this case we just leaned forward

995
01:18:56.08 --> 01:19:03.12
kept walking and tried to ignore the song in our heads the ones the troops called the bug out blues

996
01:19:07.20 --> 01:19:13.44
so this is the life of a ground pounder at often think the risks were higher in the recon company

997
01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:20.32
but life in George was far more harsh at least in recon we frequently rode on the backs of our

998
01:19:20.32 --> 01:19:26.000
tanks in thus kept warm in the infantry it was just a plotting grind one foot after the other

999
01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:30.96
until the column stopped and we'd flopped down the sound sound asleep before our heads touched the

1000
01:19:30.96 --> 01:19:36.96
ground in recon we were seldom hungry because we stashed rations on the tanks in the infantry

1001
01:19:36.96 --> 01:19:44.80
growling bellies were our constant companions in the infantry many men lost their will to live

1002
01:19:44.80 --> 01:19:50.40
frequently guys would just quit drop out of the moving column and plunk down on the side of the

1003
01:19:50.40 --> 01:19:56.16
road sometimes with the Chinese within sight you'd say come on buddy get up let's go you're going to be

1004
01:19:56.16 --> 01:20:03.12
captured and he'd say I don't care I can't go another step a day felt like a week and the more tired

1005
01:20:03.12 --> 01:20:09.12
and infantry became the the more tired and infantry man became the more he wanted to lighten his

1006
01:20:09.12 --> 01:20:15.68
load first would go the souvenirs then his extra ammo next would be the bulky gear the field coat

1007
01:20:15.68 --> 01:20:21.84
the pile jackets and the down sleeping bags even though he'd new heat freeze that night in the

1008
01:20:21.84 --> 01:20:27.68
infantry I found you live for right now you don't give a damn about tomorrow because you don't

1009
01:20:27.68 --> 01:20:35.60
even know if there'll be one getting it's weird I know you like to talk about the

1010
01:20:37.60 --> 01:20:44.24
the long game versus the short game versus the the strategic moves versus the tactical moves

1011
01:20:44.24 --> 01:20:49.52
but it's interesting when you think about what's happening right now with a human being and with

1012
01:20:49.52 --> 01:20:57.68
human beings in general as we encounter stress as we encounter pain and suffering we start to focus

1013
01:20:57.68 --> 01:21:05.52
on just a short term just a short term win and think about that in up from a life perspective I mean

1014
01:21:05.52 --> 01:21:09.36
here you are you know it's going to be freezing tonight you know it's going to be freezing but you

1015
01:21:09.36 --> 01:21:15.84
don't want to carry this down sleeping bag anymore so you just leave it think about how crazy that is

1016
01:21:16.40 --> 01:21:23.04
but we make decisions all the time that are that stupid but we want that short term gratification

1017
01:21:24.24 --> 01:21:31.76
one a lot of cases relief like short term relief which I guess as far as the game goes

1018
01:21:31.76 --> 01:21:37.28
same thing so it's like relief gratification you know whatever yeah like there's a difference

1019
01:21:37.28 --> 01:21:41.84
but in the games for as the games concerned that's what you're going for you know and like

1020
01:21:42.48 --> 01:21:48.80
like a craving right yeah craving like that's a relief from that's been crazy that's throwing away

1021
01:21:48.80 --> 01:21:55.68
your you're down sleeping back that's what it is it's gonna feel good right now like you just

1022
01:21:55.68 --> 01:22:00.08
got rid of three pounds yeah and deep by the way back in the day like these down sleeping bags you

1023
01:22:00.08 --> 01:22:06.40
know like nowadays things are feather lights you know this is probably four or five pounds which is

1024
01:22:06.40 --> 01:22:11.52
a big difference in your whole math thing I think about what that does think about the

1025
01:22:11.52 --> 01:22:16.16
you're right man it's a craving right it's when you say I really want to eat those cheetos you

1026
01:22:16.16 --> 01:22:23.04
just not like I just want to just let's cheetos are going to be good yeah even when you

1027
01:22:23.04 --> 01:22:29.12
after you eat your you're I don't know chicken salad or whatever cheetos still sound kind of good you know

1028
01:22:29.12 --> 01:22:36.88
it's still like a little little thing that you just dump in this might my down parka yeah that could

1029
01:22:36.88 --> 01:22:41.44
keep me warm yeah but I think what it has to do with see there's there's this difference

1030
01:22:42.64 --> 01:22:48.08
what it has to do with is like one is caused by suffering and you just get into this mode of just

1031
01:22:48.80 --> 01:22:53.12
basically surrender maybe that is what happens in life maybe you get to a point we just kind of

1032
01:22:53.12 --> 01:22:58.32
surrender to where you're at it's kind of accept like hey this is just me yeah and now you know

1033
01:22:58.32 --> 01:23:05.68
cheetos no cheetos whatever don't know yeah that's a good way of putting it accepting where you're at

1034
01:23:05.68 --> 01:23:11.60
yeah it's like because where you're at it's a place in your mind too you know how like even if

1035
01:23:11.60 --> 01:23:16.16
you're you're making progress but you're used to not making progress you know when you're really

1036
01:23:16.16 --> 01:23:21.20
used to it can happen like with like if you have like a certain amount of money in your bank account

1037
01:23:21.20 --> 01:23:28.000
your a kid or young man whatever if you're used to having like you know 20 dollars in there yeah

1038
01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:34.000
like just constantly that's sort of the baseline or whatever and then you're like then you get 100

1039
01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:40.64
hundred or 500 900 oh but you're used to having 20 it's like yeah like I'm making progress

1040
01:23:40.64 --> 01:23:46.16
I'm saving money but you're used to having 20 so then you go out by that big screen TV there's a

1041
01:23:46.16 --> 01:23:52.16
chance that I'll have that down the 20 exactly right accept where you're accept your place accept it

1042
01:23:52.16 --> 01:23:58.80
you can't do that basically yeah like you have to like actively maybe like raise your

1043
01:23:59.20 --> 01:24:04.24
frill raise your standard now when you get the 900 and there now the new standard is I don't

1044
01:24:04.24 --> 01:24:10.64
I'll make your realistic I guess but 800 should be the standard like the baseline now you know

1045
01:24:10.64 --> 01:24:16.16
so sure you got some wiggle room maybe you're not perfect maybe it's new to you okay but the standard is 8

1046
01:24:16.16 --> 01:24:20.96
like you start going below 8 that's the same thing as having negative kind of attitude but you

1047
01:24:20.96 --> 01:24:25.92
got a really established in your head you know it's hard though very because people are where they are

1048
01:24:25.92 --> 01:24:30.32
and they kind of get used to it that's why they that's why they are where they are because they're

1049
01:24:30.32 --> 01:24:37.76
literally used to you know not like pretend you used to it is it good to get well never mind is it

1050
01:24:37.76 --> 01:24:43.12
it's good to get that new standard and actually stay there long enough that you feel it yeah

1051
01:24:43.12 --> 01:24:47.84
you get used to the new standard that's the tricky part yeah you feel good but then you're like

1052
01:24:47.84 --> 01:24:53.68
oh well and then you go back to your normal ways yeah first craving that comes about satisfying the

1053
01:24:53.68 --> 01:24:58.88
craving relief from the create however you want to put it like even like when you say suffering it's

1054
01:24:58.88 --> 01:25:02.48
kind of like what does that really mean you know I mean there's certain levels of suffering for

1055
01:25:02.48 --> 01:25:09.52
sure like you can go deep into human suffering for sure but really to some people like not having a

1056
01:25:09.52 --> 01:25:14.80
drink the suffering you know when they're like or have a craving for ice cream or something like this

1057
01:25:14.80 --> 01:25:20.72
it's like it's kind of like so it's suffering you know that's really horrible stretches and

1058
01:25:20.72 --> 01:25:25.52
I mean really to think like I can't have ice cream on the suffering well in your kind of addiction

1059
01:25:26.40 --> 01:25:31.36
I'm assuming you know like I've the only addiction I've really dealt with as far as like seeing

1060
01:25:31.36 --> 01:25:35.84
people as like a cigarette scenario where they're like craving a cigarette so much and it's like

1061
01:25:35.84 --> 01:25:43.76
and they kind of seem like you're kind of suffering okay my my contention here is that not

1062
01:25:43.76 --> 01:25:56.72
having ice cream we cannot equivocate that to suffer I understand yes bottom line is let's be

1063
01:25:56.72 --> 01:26:03.12
careful that we aren't thinking short term let's hang on to our sleeping bag let's carry the extra weight

1064
01:26:03.12 --> 01:26:07.60
because in the long run it's gonna pay off yeah that's what I'm getting it that seems like

1065
01:26:07.60 --> 01:26:12.96
obvious suffering where you're like hey I'm gonna need that tonight you know I'm gonna literally

1066
01:26:12.96 --> 01:26:18.08
need that to stay alive possible yeah not the kind where or that would be that'll serve nice tonight

1067
01:26:18.08 --> 01:26:24.000
that would be cool tonight it's not that I'm gonna need that tonight or I risk death and yet right now

1068
01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:29.04
my suffering is still bad I got to get rid of it to not have it tonight I do it oh yeah I

1069
01:26:29.04 --> 01:26:37.04
mean that is back to the book now and then if we were really lucky we'd stop in a village and

1070
01:26:37.04 --> 01:26:45.20
command commandeer and abandoned house for 10 or 20 weeks a Korean home had hard Adobe mud floors

1071
01:26:45.60 --> 01:26:50.16
under which lay an oven the purpose of which was to provide central heating for the entire house

1072
01:26:50.16 --> 01:26:56.56
of course American soldiers had no idea how these things worked and the first time around we built

1073
01:26:56.56 --> 01:27:01.44
the biggest fire we could and went to sleep shivering and bitching that the gooks didn't know

1074
01:27:01.44 --> 01:27:06.64
how to do anything right it turned out though that the previous occupants of the of our temporary

1075
01:27:06.64 --> 01:27:11.28
abode had the last laugh throughout the night the floor's got hotter and hotter until some of the

1076
01:27:11.28 --> 01:27:18.16
guys jackets spontaneously combustion and the ammo we made on the floor blew up snow never looks

1077
01:27:18.16 --> 01:27:24.64
so good so you're going one extreme to the other on most nights though to stay off the cold we'd

1078
01:27:24.64 --> 01:27:31.84
employed the old soldiers tricks from the bleak frozen days of valley forge one was to stuff

1079
01:27:31.84 --> 01:27:36.64
hay and a poncho and wrap it so tightly around two guys to keep in the body heat another was

1080
01:27:36.64 --> 01:27:41.28
to fill your steel pot with coals and embrace it all night long a practice that continued despite

1081
01:27:41.28 --> 01:27:47.60
a number of tired soldiers who died this way from a situation another was to put a slug through your foot

1082
01:27:49.60 --> 01:27:54.64
in other words shoot yourself in the foot I'd thought about that one most of us did

1083
01:27:55.12 --> 01:27:59.52
but it always seemed to risky you might blow your foot off you might get caught and court

1084
01:27:59.52 --> 01:28:04.56
marshalled but one bitterly cold night when I would have done anything to get out of that place

1085
01:28:04.56 --> 01:28:10.80
I came up with a perfect solution if I emptied most of the powder out of a grenade I could

1086
01:28:10.80 --> 01:28:16.56
toss into my foxhole and blame it on a sneaky china man better yet if I chip the trench on the

1087
01:28:16.56 --> 01:28:23.44
side of the foxhole with my bayonet I could contain the damage to my leg only all I'd have to

1088
01:28:23.44 --> 01:28:28.48
do would be lay my body in the trench and stick my leg in the hole toss in a frag grenade and bang

1089
01:28:28.48 --> 01:28:34.08
million dollar wound it was a wonderful idea somehow a lot better than the one I'd often saw

1090
01:28:34.08 --> 01:28:38.08
during a firefight when a guy would stay in his hole in wave his arms or kick his legs like a

1091
01:28:38.08 --> 01:28:43.60
corpus dancer hoping to catch a slug and the first boat back to the states and I spent all night

1092
01:28:43.60 --> 01:28:48.56
digging away working on the trench and thinking how war might be back in Santa Monica

1093
01:28:49.44 --> 01:28:55.28
the war vet who got it in the leg I chipped and chipped away on the frozen ground completely

1094
01:28:55.28 --> 01:29:00.000
forgetting about the cold the time the fact that I needed some sleep or that my buddy who was sleeping

1095
01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:06.000
me on uh sleeping behind the hole may have had enough find the it was ready I hoisted myself into

1096
01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:11.84
the trench prepared the grenade and dangled my leg in the hole and I was just about to pull that

1097
01:29:11.84 --> 01:29:17.52
pin when I saw the most beautiful sight a sight that every infantry man and Korea dreamed of seeing

1098
01:29:18.56 --> 01:29:24.80
it was the sun slowly rising they meant the terrible night was over it meant I could light my

1099
01:29:24.80 --> 01:29:32.08
fire and be warm again so I forgot my little trench and for a moment forgot the other thing

1100
01:29:32.08 --> 01:29:38.48
the sun meant the beginning of yet another long day another step south the never ender ending

1101
01:29:38.48 --> 01:29:47.52
bitter taste of defeat in all our mouths so this is hack this is freaking hack worth

1102
01:29:47.52 --> 01:29:53.60
who just went a wall to go because he didn't think his true for fighting hard enough he gets to

1103
01:29:53.60 --> 01:29:59.92
the front lines he's he's is where he wants to be and even hack is thinking about either shooting

1104
01:29:59.92 --> 01:30:04.08
himself or in the foot and then beyond thinking about he comes up with a scheme with a grenade

1105
01:30:04.08 --> 01:30:09.68
and he actually executes the entire plan other than the actual event itself and the only thing

1106
01:30:09.68 --> 01:30:18.48
it stops him is that the sun's coming up that's that's freaking insane yeah and I'll tell you

1107
01:30:18.48 --> 01:30:22.32
you know when I take away from that hold on a little bit longer the sun's gonna come up

1108
01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:28.96
hold on a little bit longer the sun's gonna come up I posted something about that the other day

1109
01:30:28.96 --> 01:30:34.96
because I was watching the sun go down and go through seal training when the sun's going down

1110
01:30:36.40 --> 01:30:41.20
and you know the instructors will be they blind you up and they say good night say good night to the

1111
01:30:41.20 --> 01:30:47.44
sun jense it's gonna be a long cold wet night and they're just making trying to make people think

1112
01:30:47.44 --> 01:30:54.40
hey you got whatever however many hours gonna be dark for 12-8-9 it's gonna suck

1113
01:30:54.40 --> 01:31:00.16
it's gonna suck and that's what they want you to think about how much it's gonna suck

1114
01:31:01.84 --> 01:31:05.12
but if you're in the back of your mind you go yeah the sun will come up in the morning

1115
01:31:05.12 --> 01:31:12.000
they can't stop that from happening yeah to get in that tough situation remember

1116
01:31:13.52 --> 01:31:19.28
the sun's gonna come up you can get through it man yeah you got to admit though man I kind of

1117
01:31:19.28 --> 01:31:24.72
felt for a little bit when he's like digging the thing and thinking about how warm he's gonna be

1118
01:31:24.72 --> 01:31:30.000
it's like yeah yeah it's full fantasy out stretch the front of him yeah you know what I'm saying

1119
01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:35.52
yeah yeah and then I mean it and then then the standard starts to get shifted kind of like oh yeah

1120
01:31:35.52 --> 01:31:39.92
you're almost kind of used to like the warmth that you can imagine you know and to have that warmth kind

1121
01:31:39.92 --> 01:31:44.80
of just taking away meaning you got to shift your plan back to like the reality whatever

1122
01:31:44.80 --> 01:31:50.16
man that can see all that could be hard he's even got the fantasy of like hey the war vet yeah

1123
01:31:50.16 --> 01:31:55.68
you know hape got yeah got got it in the leg he's got his whole fantasy planned out he's ready to

1124
01:31:55.68 --> 01:32:04.24
execute on this thing and this guy is like born for a yeah and that's how shitty this situation gets

1125
01:32:04.24 --> 01:32:10.48
yeah and that's like another thing it says like how like how bad should he get get people are thinking

1126
01:32:10.48 --> 01:32:16.08
oh yeah imagine what somebody that doesn't really want to be there imagine what's going through

1127
01:32:16.08 --> 01:32:27.04
their freaking minds you back to the book and then as if overnight everything changed it turned out

1128
01:32:27.04 --> 01:32:32.88
that despite the fact that I never saw a general on the battlefield apparently one lieutenant general

1129
01:32:32.88 --> 01:32:40.08
Matthew Ridgeway had been all over the in England the eight army front assessing the situation and

1130
01:32:40.08 --> 01:32:46.64
making his plans I wrote in an open Jeep he would later write in his memoirs and would permit

1131
01:32:46.64 --> 01:32:53.20
no Jeep with the top up to operate in the combat zone writing in a closed vehicle in a battle area

1132
01:32:53.20 --> 01:32:59.52
puts a man in the wrong frame of mind it gives him an erroneous sense of warmth of safety his

1133
01:32:59.52 --> 01:33:06.48
mental attitude is that of an ostrich poking his head in the sand also I held the old fashioned

1134
01:33:06.48 --> 01:33:13.12
idea that it helped spirits of the men to see the old man up there in the snow and sleet in the mud

1135
01:33:13.12 --> 01:33:20.64
sharing the same cold miserable existence that they had to endure as a consequence I damn near froze

1136
01:33:20.64 --> 01:33:31.52
and quote nevertheless Ridgeway per persevered with no quarter given he banned the word retreat

1137
01:33:31.52 --> 01:33:37.12
from the English language at least in so far as correspondence could describe our miserable

1138
01:33:37.12 --> 01:33:44.56
truck to the south quote I'm more interested in your plans for attack he told a staff officer

1139
01:33:44.56 --> 01:33:50.08
when the latter offered up those for another withdrawal he even he recognized even before we did

1140
01:33:50.08 --> 01:33:55.28
that the Chinese offensive was running out of steam and sought to take advantage of it with deep

1141
01:33:55.28 --> 01:34:01.28
patrols to the north to find out exactly how stretched the enemy was operation wolfhound was the

1142
01:34:01.28 --> 01:34:06.96
first of these and the fire brigade under the command of Colonel Mike Alas or Mike Alas

1143
01:34:08.48 --> 01:34:14.000
one of general Ridgeways World War II airborne protigase was on the attack once more

1144
01:34:14.80 --> 01:34:18.80
so now you have a totally different situation the guide goes to the front line and he actually sees

1145
01:34:18.80 --> 01:34:22.80
what's happening and not least he see what his troops are going through but he also sees what's happening

1146
01:34:22.80 --> 01:34:26.48
with the Chinese he sees them start to get fined out he sees maybe there's not as much pressure as he

1147
01:34:26.48 --> 01:34:34.000
originally saw so he can say look all right we're done retreating here we go back to the book

1148
01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:39.04
two platoons of G company and elements of the 89 tank battalion made up one of the task forces

1149
01:34:39.04 --> 01:34:46.64
named for and commanded by our own company commander Jack Michaelie task force Michaelie was given the

1150
01:34:46.64 --> 01:34:53.12
mission of taking suwan and on the 16th of January it did just that the enemy was totally unprepared

1151
01:34:53.12 --> 01:34:58.48
for the daring daylight assault George was outside of artillery range captain Michaelie

1152
01:34:58.48 --> 01:35:05.04
an old horse caveman approached suwan in the only way possible frontally downer road never

1153
01:35:05.04 --> 01:35:11.36
probed for mines and fast my platoon the third was not involved in the blitzkreeg operation at all

1154
01:35:11.36 --> 01:35:16.000
but when the other guys came back having killed 150 enemy without a catch to give their own

1155
01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:20.88
in high spirits and with stories of captain Michaelie's centering across the streets of suwan

1156
01:35:20.88 --> 01:35:27.36
while enemy machine guns slugs flooded all around him all around went sky high we were ready to take

1157
01:35:27.36 --> 01:35:37.28
on the world meanwhile i got my squad and immediately said about instilling it with the trust

1158
01:35:37.28 --> 01:35:45.60
standards and beliefs about the way things should be done so so he is now given a squad

1159
01:35:45.60 --> 01:35:48.64
because he just showed up there and even though he's a new guy and even though he stabbed his own

1160
01:35:48.64 --> 01:35:55.28
pair of shit covered pants with the bayonet the middle of the night he is still given a squad

1161
01:35:55.28 --> 01:36:01.84
so i have to back up a little bit so he talks about this trust capital capital capital you

1162
01:36:01.84 --> 01:36:09.84
capital you capital t when he first got in the army as i mentioned he went to europe when he went to

1163
01:36:09.84 --> 01:36:16.80
europe he was not in combat because the war was over but there was these old timers there and

1164
01:36:17.68 --> 01:36:23.60
he explains i'm gonna abbreviate a little bit but he kind of talks about what it was like and where

1165
01:36:24.24 --> 01:36:31.76
he developed his i want to say his personality really and you know like i was

1166
01:36:32.80 --> 01:36:37.28
i always tell people when you when you go on the steel teams your first platoon leaves a big

1167
01:36:37.28 --> 01:36:44.96
mark on you and definitely your first two platoon and the teams have become a lot more similar than

1168
01:36:44.96 --> 01:36:49.84
they used to be all the different steel teams there are a lot more similar than they used to be

1169
01:36:51.28 --> 01:36:57.36
they used to be they used to have much more of their own personalities team one the nickname for

1170
01:36:57.36 --> 01:37:04.64
team one which is where i was was stallog team one because it was you know you had uniforms and

1171
01:37:04.64 --> 01:37:08.88
inspections and you had you everyone had short hair and they inspected your hair cuts and all the

1172
01:37:08.88 --> 01:37:15.76
stuff team five was kind of you know they were kind of wild kind of just do you know they had

1173
01:37:16.48 --> 01:37:22.32
no inspections and they were just kind of they had the they had the image of being more wild

1174
01:37:23.44 --> 01:37:27.92
then team three was sort of a little bit in between but they were also sort of

1175
01:37:29.68 --> 01:37:33.28
they seemed like shy for lack of a better one like team three was just kind of

1176
01:37:33.28 --> 01:37:37.36
like they were just doing over there doing their thing they were also disconnected because they

1177
01:37:37.36 --> 01:37:42.88
were deploying to south west Asia back then and team one and team two were deploying to south

1178
01:37:42.88 --> 01:37:47.60
east areas so they were a little bit disconnected which made them seem a little bit more shy i

1179
01:37:47.60 --> 01:37:50.72
guess i don't know that's the right word but they were just a little bit more different they were

1180
01:37:50.72 --> 01:37:56.24
all kind of on their own program team one on one under the spectrum stallog team one team five kind

1181
01:37:56.24 --> 01:38:00.08
of wild team three somewhere in the middle the everyone had their own personalities and team and the

1182
01:38:00.08 --> 01:38:03.84
east coast had their own personalities too and they kind of lined up a little bit

1183
01:38:04.88 --> 01:38:09.68
except for the fact that team two and team one were sort of the traditional old school ones

1184
01:38:09.68 --> 01:38:14.000
that's why when i went from team one to the east coast i tried to go to team two and i did

1185
01:38:15.04 --> 01:38:20.40
team four was more like the wild one teammate was kind of in the middle that's back in the day

1186
01:38:20.40 --> 01:38:24.80
now the teams are very similar because they all kind of were on the same rotation you're going the same

1187
01:38:24.80 --> 01:38:30.56
types of deployments so they're much more similar but wherever you spend your early days leaves an

1188
01:38:30.56 --> 01:38:36.80
impression on you and that's kind of what happened to hack he shows up into this environment and

1189
01:38:36.80 --> 01:38:41.92
i'm going to go into it here back to the book gradually so now we're going back in time it's the

1190
01:38:41.92 --> 01:38:47.68
end of world war two the fighting's over but he's he's deployed and he's in Europe back to the

1191
01:38:47.68 --> 01:38:52.88
book gradually most of the world war two warriors went back to the states and the post war wild

1192
01:38:52.88 --> 01:38:58.24
west feeling of lawlessness went to and it'd been great fun for a kid to be part of the hell

1193
01:38:58.24 --> 01:39:06.80
for leather spirit that made up the 752nd the 752s but like the tightening of a screw one turn

1194
01:39:06.80 --> 01:39:13.76
in a time each day the unit became more military the who gives a damn attitude of the remaining 752

1195
01:39:13.76 --> 01:39:20.16
combat leaders and troopers replaced by the exacting discipline of the peace time army for the next

1196
01:39:20.16 --> 01:39:26.80
four years i learned my trade one year with the recon company of the tank battalion in the poe valley

1197
01:39:26.80 --> 01:39:33.60
and three more months with trees united states troops and this were the anacronum trust comes from

1198
01:39:34.48 --> 01:39:41.68
trees united states troops the illustrious unit whose five thousand hand picked members

1199
01:39:41.68 --> 01:39:50.000
Walter Winshal called quote the chrome plated soldiers of Europe we worked hard during those years

1200
01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:56.48
long merciless days of training repeating training repeating repeating repeating until we got it right

1201
01:39:57.28 --> 01:40:04.32
our transformation into soldiers inspired and monitors by those battle savvy n n c o's who

1202
01:40:04.32 --> 01:40:10.40
well knew that discipline and tactical proficiency on the battlefield were the direct results of

1203
01:40:10.40 --> 01:40:17.84
discipline and combat skills instilled on the parade and training grounds at night it was down on

1204
01:40:17.84 --> 01:40:23.44
our hands and knees all of us hand waxing the barracks floors until we had enough money to chip in

1205
01:40:23.44 --> 01:40:29.28
and buy a buffer you could eat off those floors just as you could just as you could almost be

1206
01:40:29.28 --> 01:40:34.80
blinded by the brass belt buckles and brown boots that each of us wore polished every night

1207
01:40:34.80 --> 01:40:40.80
to a dazzling finish the only way out of these activities was sick call but rarely was it used as an

1208
01:40:40.80 --> 01:40:46.80
excuse it took as much effort to see the dock you had to strip your bed cram all your perfectly

1209
01:40:46.80 --> 01:40:51.44
pressed clothes into a duffle bag see the supply sergeant and then the first sergeant not to

1210
01:40:51.44 --> 01:40:55.68
mention the lion's share of a month's pay you'd spend having your clothes repressed when you came

1211
01:40:55.68 --> 01:41:02.000
back as it did to continue with the normal routine punishment was needed out by a process known as

1212
01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:10.40
n c o justice for I love saying that for crimes such as a uniform of less than starched

1213
01:41:10.40 --> 01:41:16.88
perfection a bed that didn't bounce a quarter or even a mildly insubordinate smirk the sentence

1214
01:41:16.88 --> 01:41:22.96
could range from 50 pushups to double timing around the parade field holding a 9.5 pound m1 rifle

1215
01:41:22.96 --> 01:41:30.48
over your head yelling I'm a shithead I'm a shithead until you collapse we rarely saw an officer

1216
01:41:30.48 --> 01:41:36.08
above our platoon leader and he was seldom with the truth because of administrative duties but no

1217
01:41:36.08 --> 01:41:41.44
one seemed too concerned about it above and below the chain of command it was well recognized

1218
01:41:41.44 --> 01:41:50.32
that as fathers teachers older brothers and chief tormentors in trees the n c o core had no equal

1219
01:41:52.96 --> 01:41:58.24
so that's what he's talking about when he's talking about this trust attitude of discipline

1220
01:41:58.24 --> 01:42:07.04
and training hard that's where it comes from so now we're back to Korea we're back to him

1221
01:42:07.04 --> 01:42:13.92
getting a squad and here's what he does meanwhile I got my squad and immediately said about instilling

1222
01:42:13.92 --> 01:42:19.36
it with my trust standards and beliefs about the way things should be done I got out of a

1223
01:42:19.36 --> 01:42:23.92
notebook and wrote down each man's name rank and serial number his blood type weapon number

1224
01:42:23.92 --> 01:42:28.08
next of kin and whatever training combat experience he had I started demanding that rifles

1225
01:42:28.08 --> 01:42:33.20
be cleaned and that shoulders shape up if I saw soldier walking around without his weapon the next

1226
01:42:33.20 --> 01:42:37.44
thing he knew he'd be on the deck crawling to it while I stood by kicking him and telling him

1227
01:42:37.44 --> 01:42:44.48
that with each kick was that he was being hit with a slug brutal stuff I'd learned it in basic

1228
01:42:44.48 --> 01:42:50.56
training will lieutenant cramer at the fort knocks rifle range kicked my arm until I positioned it

1229
01:42:50.56 --> 01:43:00.08
correctly under my weapon but that's how a guy learns besides better my foot and a mythical

1230
01:43:00.08 --> 01:43:09.68
slug than an enemy slug and a goodbye friendly foot arm or life that's how a guy learned

1231
01:43:11.76 --> 01:43:15.52
you want to talk about a politically incorrect unpopular thing to say

1232
01:43:15.52 --> 01:43:26.96
yeah I remember when I was a new guy I remember some of the older guys saying to me you know

1233
01:43:28.16 --> 01:43:33.28
sometimes people need to get beaten so that they learn and you know what I said

1234
01:43:34.32 --> 01:43:40.40
that's correct it's actually accurate I hate to say it because everyone hate right I don't hate to say

1235
01:43:40.40 --> 01:43:49.04
it it's the truth what sometimes you need to learn a lesson the hard way and if you don't think

1236
01:43:49.04 --> 01:44:01.28
it's a big deal whatever it's a big deal yeah so that's what he said that's how a guy learns

1237
01:44:01.28 --> 01:44:12.08
once again what do we have we have 18 19 17 21 year old men who's what is it the frontal cortex

1238
01:44:12.08 --> 01:44:18.000
what is it the frontal lobes they're not really they're not fully developed yeah they understand

1239
01:44:18.56 --> 01:44:26.64
physicalness physicality yeah that's one of those things that it's kind of universally

1240
01:44:26.64 --> 01:44:33.92
like understood you know pain is not good you know some people can take more pain than others

1241
01:44:33.92 --> 01:44:38.96
for sure but after a while it's like we all kind of don't like pain yeah of course of course

1242
01:44:38.96 --> 01:44:45.60
this weirdos whatever but for the most part they're like these things that if you start to threaten

1243
01:44:45.60 --> 01:44:50.88
it's like you know it's valuable to people here's the other thing this is a this is a

1244
01:44:50.88 --> 01:44:56.72
fucking harsh environment right this is war you're getting people ready for war you're getting

1245
01:44:56.72 --> 01:45:00.88
people ready to kill you're getting people ready to freeze you're getting people ready to suffer

1246
01:45:00.88 --> 01:45:07.12
you're getting people ready to have to march for miles and miles and miles with no food with no

1247
01:45:07.12 --> 01:45:15.44
sleep like this is what the job entails and if you think you can pamper someone and that's

1248
01:45:15.44 --> 01:45:20.24
going to effectively prepare them for those type of situations I don't think that's accurate yeah

1249
01:45:20.24 --> 01:45:27.36
thank you're at about that back to the book my guys thought I was crazy and a prick to boot

1250
01:45:28.64 --> 01:45:35.44
they still didn't believe I paid my my battlefield dues little did they know that they were doing

1251
01:45:35.44 --> 01:45:41.04
the pain in spades from making me get that sergeant combat feeling all over again

1252
01:45:43.28 --> 01:45:48.24
then came six February which we talked about in the last podcast part of another reconnaissance

1253
01:45:48.24 --> 01:45:53.36
enforce mission code named operation thunderbolt which turned into a full-scale attack and I never

1254
01:45:53.36 --> 01:45:58.72
got a complaint again so after his performance we which we talked about in 249 what he did to

1255
01:45:58.72 --> 01:46:06.48
lead that day back to the book in fact the reaction was the direct opposite no longer was either hard

1256
01:46:06.48 --> 01:46:12.80
ass sergeant who arrived out of the blue with strange ideas of discipline and training now I was just

1257
01:46:12.80 --> 01:46:18.40
hack hack the great fighter who'd gotten shot in the head courageously saving lives and

1258
01:46:18.40 --> 01:46:25.68
inflicting punishment on the enemy it was a great relief knowing I would not have to prove myself

1259
01:46:25.68 --> 01:46:32.80
to anyone anymore but what I didn't know at the time was that the name I made for myself on six

1260
01:46:32.80 --> 01:46:44.80
February 1951 was one I'd have to live up to for the next 20 years so he and this is a story that

1261
01:46:44.80 --> 01:46:50.80
gets repeated throughout his life he kind of shows up somewhere he has the hard core mentality

1262
01:46:50.80 --> 01:46:57.68
people kind of question it but then they see how it enables them and and and protects them in combat

1263
01:46:57.68 --> 01:47:02.96
and then they're kind they're they're down for the cause back to the book it seemed ironic that the

1264
01:47:02.96 --> 01:47:07.60
thing that saved my life on that day was the very thing I hated most in Korea the cold the blood kept

1265
01:47:07.60 --> 01:47:12.16
pumping this is when he's referring back to when he got shot in the head the blood kept pumping but

1266
01:47:12.16 --> 01:47:16.96
it froze almost as soon as it came out of my head after the dock patch me up with the car

1267
01:47:16.96 --> 01:47:23.68
lile bandage I radioed captain Makai uh Michaelie and gave mcitrep I'd already appointed another

1268
01:47:23.68 --> 01:47:29.84
ncota skipper lible tune Michaelie told me that to head for the road behind which gill crest

1269
01:47:29.84 --> 01:47:35.20
platoon was fighting he would send a litter Jeep there to pick me up the platoon dock always worried

1270
01:47:35.20 --> 01:47:40.64
about his flock wanted to tag along I told him I'd make it police to one of our dead's m ones

1271
01:47:40.64 --> 01:47:46.08
and headed off I kept low using the rice paddy walls and irrigation ditches for cover I probably

1272
01:47:46.08 --> 01:47:50.48
wouldn't have felt that if I'd gotten hit again anyways because during my run back down the drainage

1273
01:47:50.48 --> 01:47:56.24
ditch I'd fallen through the ice and been soaked from the waste down the water and zero degree

1274
01:47:56.24 --> 01:48:03.12
weather it turned my lower torso into a block of ice my head was spinning and my balls were frozen

1275
01:48:03.12 --> 01:48:09.12
and I wasn't sure which one worried me more then I came upon pfc Charles the guy I had

1276
01:48:09.12 --> 01:48:14.72
earlier tasked to take the two North Korean POWs we'd captured during that morning to the old

1277
01:48:14.72 --> 01:48:21.44
man foreign terrigation Charles was sitting in a drainage ditch by the road eating a can of sea rations

1278
01:48:21.44 --> 01:48:27.44
at his feet where the prisoners stretched out in the ditch dead each from a single bullet in the

1279
01:48:27.44 --> 01:48:34.72
back of the head I was outraged why'd you kill them they tried to escape he said simply

1280
01:48:34.72 --> 01:48:40.24
but I didn't believe him besides he continued I wasn't going to risk my ass to get two gooks out

1281
01:48:40.24 --> 01:48:46.64
of here there wasn't much I could do I told him to report back to the platoon Gilchraas later told

1282
01:48:46.64 --> 01:48:52.80
me that Charles had received word only days before that his brother had been killed in action

1283
01:48:52.80 --> 01:48:59.60
over in the second division not too good a choice for an escort hack he'd remark drawing on his

1284
01:48:59.60 --> 01:49:06.56
pipe I continued on small arms a machine gun fire was skipping down the road I gave it all a

1285
01:49:06.56 --> 01:49:11.76
big miss and kept to my little ditch I headed south until I met Lieutenant Colonel Gordon Merch

1286
01:49:12.56 --> 01:49:17.76
our old battalion CEO who was controlling the battle from his tactical CP behind the roadside

1287
01:49:17.76 --> 01:49:23.76
no a few hundred yards from the front there I was placed on a litter in a medical Jeep and as we

1288
01:49:23.76 --> 01:49:29.92
bump down the road all I could think was howl a you howl a lua got it made I'm leaving this god damn

1289
01:49:29.92 --> 01:49:37.12
place or so I thought because just then the jeep's radio crackled on first platoon George company got a

1290
01:49:37.12 --> 01:49:43.36
serious wound real bad get their fast he'll be on the side of the road I couldn't believe it let me

1291
01:49:43.36 --> 01:49:48.16
how I'll wait here so there's he's getting out of it on this Jeep and all of a sudden over

1292
01:49:48.16 --> 01:49:53.12
the radio says hey we need that jeep back here and hack where's sinkin let me out bro let me out

1293
01:49:53.12 --> 01:50:00.64
I'll wait here I thought but I was too weak to tired too cold to get the words out the jeep spun

1294
01:50:00.64 --> 01:50:06.000
around and headed back up that fire swept road pass Colonel Merch right into the jaws the whole

1295
01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:11.68
god damn communist army we stopped the medics calmly sontored out to pick up the other casualty

1296
01:50:11.68 --> 01:50:15.92
they took all the time in the world or so it seemed while the enemy used the large red cross

1297
01:50:15.92 --> 01:50:21.04
markings on the Jeep for target practice the jeep's canvas size were sides were being ventilated

1298
01:50:21.04 --> 01:50:26.56
the slugs were passing above and below my litter I felt totally helpless and score that whoever

1299
01:50:26.56 --> 01:50:32.32
the wounded guy was I would hate him for life which from the way things were going was not going to be

1300
01:50:32.32 --> 01:50:40.64
long it turned out he was a buddy through the Hawaiian mafia connection a handsome six footer named

1301
01:50:40.64 --> 01:50:47.60
Ray Mendez I almost kept my kept to my word though when I found out his critical wound to be a

1302
01:50:47.60 --> 01:50:52.48
slug in the thigh when he'd been hit he'd rolled up in a ball blooded squirted out of his leg all

1303
01:50:52.48 --> 01:50:57.36
over the front of his jacket and someone had concluded that he had taken it in the gut oblivious

1304
01:50:57.36 --> 01:51:03.28
to the fight raging on all signs of our thin skin ambulance jeep Mendez became chirpier and

1305
01:51:03.28 --> 01:51:08.24
chirpier as we headed out of the battle area he sang praises of his million dollar wound and spun

1306
01:51:08.24 --> 01:51:14.000
dreams about his in imminent return to the islands me one big war hero bra he said

1307
01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:20.64
the regimental collection collecting station was jammed with casualties the surgeon who bent over

1308
01:51:20.64 --> 01:51:26.56
my litter was covered with blood like a butcher we're going to bypass division clearing and

1309
01:51:26.56 --> 01:51:32.16
send you straight to mash at Sioux want he said you're on your way home the next stop was quick

1310
01:51:32.16 --> 01:51:38.32
mash was near the emergency runway at Sioux want the dock there wrote on my wounded leg

1311
01:51:38.32 --> 01:51:46.08
oh my wounded tag emergency air evac which somehow scared me and before I knew it I was strapped

1312
01:51:46.08 --> 01:51:54.56
down to the deck of a sea 47 we took off just at dark why don't they close the goddamn door

1313
01:51:54.56 --> 01:52:01.44
I thought it had to be open because I'd never been colder I was shaking like a jackhammer

1314
01:52:01.44 --> 01:52:07.12
I couldn't feel my hands or feet a flight nurse stayed right with me another anonymous son

1315
01:52:07.12 --> 01:52:12.08
ominous science or he's getting like they put air evac immediately he's like oh god that

1316
01:52:12.08 --> 01:52:15.44
means I must be really wounded bad he's got this flight nurse staying right with him

1317
01:52:15.44 --> 01:52:20.000
she piled on blanket after blanket with no effect just as I was reaching the point where I

1318
01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:25.84
didn't know if I could take it anymore we landed in Busan and it was another world paradise in fact

1319
01:52:26.64 --> 01:52:34.08
a heated ambulance was waiting as they loaded me in I felt like that old bull weafel who lived in

1320
01:52:34.08 --> 01:52:40.32
the red hot fire mighty warm but nice I'd found a home I fell asleep and didn't wake up again

1321
01:52:40.32 --> 01:52:48.24
until I was being winched aboard the hospital ship USS Haven in Busan Harbor I opened my eyes

1322
01:52:48.24 --> 01:52:56.000
and everything I saw was white clean and oh so warm medics were starched the nurses all look

1323
01:52:56.000 --> 01:53:03.76
like Doris Day I was stripped placed in crisp white sheets with soft blue blankets I was safe

1324
01:53:03.76 --> 01:53:10.96
and suddenly starving a medic came down to the immediate rescue with a delicious hot meal I wolfed

1325
01:53:10.96 --> 01:53:16.24
it down just in time for the next wonder of wonders a beautiful young nurse in a tight little white

1326
01:53:16.24 --> 01:53:23.84
outfit who came to clean me up why did I join the navy I thought except for my bath in the

1327
01:53:23.84 --> 01:53:30.16
Korean tub I hadn't washed in more than two months I was caked with dry blood Korean mud and

1328
01:53:30.16 --> 01:53:35.12
got only knew what else each time the nurse scraped off one filthy layer she'd have to change the

1329
01:53:35.12 --> 01:53:40.88
sheets and start again it took four sheet changes with no help for me because as a head wound I

1330
01:53:40.88 --> 01:53:47.60
wasn't allowed to move it all next the poor girl had to shave off my ratty beard bad hygiene and

1331
01:53:47.60 --> 01:53:53.60
ingrown hairs had covered my face with foil like pimples it was too terrible to be funny

1332
01:53:53.60 --> 01:53:58.08
watching the nurse bobbing and weaving all over the place to avoid flying debris every time that

1333
01:53:58.08 --> 01:54:05.12
razor hit one of the anti-personnel mines buried in my cheeks the next few days were a haze sleep

1334
01:54:05.12 --> 01:54:12.48
really hard sleep people standing over me having whispered consultations blood IV X-ray after X-ray

1335
01:54:12.48 --> 01:54:17.52
doctors probing asking questions how many fingers do you see I slowly regained my strength

1336
01:54:17.52 --> 01:54:23.60
someone somebody commondured my wall from watch I never saw it again the sleep was good I caught

1337
01:54:23.60 --> 01:54:31.36
up on months of it lost but then I started getting restless the ward those spotlessly clean and

1338
01:54:31.36 --> 01:54:39.68
staffed with talented dedicated dedicated prose was an extremely depressing place we were all head wounds

1339
01:54:39.68 --> 01:54:48.16
most either terminal or vegetable cases it was amazing that many it was amazing that many young

1340
01:54:48.16 --> 01:54:54.000
boys all of them were still sucking in air one guy had tubes running out of everywhere he'd

1341
01:54:54.000 --> 01:55:01.60
caught a slug right between the eyes I wanted out I'd had my little vacation I told the

1342
01:55:01.60 --> 01:55:07.28
docs I'm ready to return to my platoon there's nothing wrong with me the doctors probably

1343
01:55:07.28 --> 01:55:13.36
thought that the bulleted done some pretty serious damage to my brain nobody wanted to go back to the

1344
01:55:13.36 --> 01:55:22.80
front they didn't realize that the guys in third platoon were my brothers my family and I love them

1345
01:55:24.48 --> 01:55:30.56
I'd only been with them three weeks it was true but in combat that's a lifetime and I didn't

1346
01:55:30.56 --> 01:55:37.68
want to leave them out there alone if by being there I could help keep them alive keep them out of a

1347
01:55:37.68 --> 01:55:55.12
head wound ward I want to go back I kept telling them well he did go back he healed up

1348
01:55:56.80 --> 01:56:06.48
he healed up pretty quickly and went back to his platoon by mid-march so he was out for maybe a month

1349
01:56:06.48 --> 01:56:17.76
and a half and you know this book is just incredibly good what by the way that's page 69

1350
01:56:17.76 --> 01:56:24.72
of a 800 page book that's where we're at page 69 of an 800 page book just in Korea he's going to get

1351
01:56:24.72 --> 01:56:30.32
two more purple hearts he's going to get battlefield commissioned he's going to take command of a

1352
01:56:30.32 --> 01:56:36.08
new radar unit he's going to go on offense against the enemy he's going to get awarded three silver

1353
01:56:36.08 --> 01:56:44.96
stars then he's going to go back to America he's going to volunteer for another tour with the 40th

1354
01:56:44.96 --> 01:56:50.64
infantry division and then that war is going to end and he's going to stay in the army and he's going

1355
01:56:50.64 --> 01:56:54.32
to go through all the political things that you have to go through to move up the chain of command

1356
01:56:54.32 --> 01:56:59.04
and then he's going to eventually deploy to Vietnam as a battalion operations officer as a battalion

1357
01:56:59.04 --> 01:57:05.68
commander he's going to go there with with SLA Marshall and then he's going to go and he's going to

1358
01:57:05.68 --> 01:57:17.84
be a battalion commander for the 439 infantry and eventually he conducts his his famous or his

1359
01:57:17.84 --> 01:57:24.40
infamous interview depending on how you look at it with the issues and answers where he

1360
01:57:24.40 --> 01:57:35.76
disparages a lot of the senior army and a lot of the civilian leadership after which he is

1361
01:57:35.76 --> 01:57:42.24
drummed out of the army rapidly and all the I mean these events that take place they're all

1362
01:57:42.24 --> 01:57:55.36
documented with such detail and it just gives so much information about leadership, about human

1363
01:57:55.36 --> 01:58:04.000
nature, about the way people act, about why people do what they do, there's so much to learn from this

1364
01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:12.72
book so we're almost at two hours right now what an honor it was for me to have written the forward

1365
01:58:12.72 --> 01:58:16.64
to this thing this book that had such a huge impact on me check it out check out the book

1366
01:58:17.68 --> 01:58:23.04
one thing that's cool about it is you don't have to look it's 800 pages long you can you don't

1367
01:58:23.04 --> 01:58:28.24
have to read the whole book in one sitting you know the story I just told you the story the story

1368
01:58:28.24 --> 01:58:33.28
is about a guy that's that that freaking loves his troops throughout his career and you pick it

1369
01:58:33.28 --> 01:58:37.36
up anywhere and you read what he's going through for two or three pages I guarantee you'll get

1370
01:58:37.36 --> 01:58:42.24
a lesson out of it it's it's that good and you don't have you don't have to read the whole thing

1371
01:58:42.24 --> 01:58:47.68
at once you will you'll want to because you'll want to know what's going to happen like I said

1372
01:58:47.68 --> 01:58:53.36
we we're on page 69 right now and by the way we skipped a bunch I skipped a whole section because

1373
01:58:53.36 --> 01:58:58.96
he got he kind of talks about the the opening action scene that I talked about but then he kind

1374
01:58:58.96 --> 01:59:02.72
of goes into how he ended up in the army and goes through the world but too and he goes through the

1375
01:59:02.72 --> 01:59:07.60
trust troops and all that then he picks back up with Korea so we didn't even cover we probably

1376
01:59:07.60 --> 01:59:22.24
covered 40 pages out of a 800 page book so check out the book it will teach you valuable

1377
01:59:22.24 --> 01:59:28.80
leadership lessons and it will teach you how to become smarter as leader and it will teach you how to become

1378
01:59:28.80 --> 01:59:38.56
a better person about face Colonel David Hackworth speaking of being better echo Charles yes

1379
01:59:40.08 --> 01:59:46.16
do you have any let's say hecumen nations sure hecumen nations well actually back to the

1380
01:59:46.16 --> 01:59:52.48
Hawaiian guy me one big war hero bra yeah it's not me he didn't say me what do you say I

1381
01:59:53.76 --> 01:59:57.20
because in pigeon no well yeah I'm sure I'm sure I'm sure I'm sure I'm sure I'm sure I'm

1382
01:59:57.20 --> 02:00:04.24
maybe remembered it incorrectly backwards was wrong is what I'm here okay I'm just saying

1383
02:00:05.04 --> 02:00:10.48
in pigeon you don't say me I might have read it wrong no he has to be says yeah he says me one big

1384
02:00:10.48 --> 02:00:18.72
war hero bra yeah so he views I'm correct pigeon I want a big war hero bra okay also

1385
02:00:18.72 --> 02:00:25.84
trying to remind me like this just totally never thought about this but when I'm realizing

1386
02:00:25.84 --> 02:00:32.96
in pigeon you say one and set up a like a like hey toss me a beer whatever toss me one beer one beer

1387
02:00:32.96 --> 02:00:38.56
yeah it's weird it's like a subtle difference right there tossing one beer no no no no no I

1388
02:00:38.56 --> 02:00:48.24
say I like but one is like you know like in non pigeon we'll say like better term you say one

1389
02:00:48.24 --> 02:00:56.48
as it only when the option of more than one is considered in the scenario you know but in pigeon you

1390
02:00:56.48 --> 02:01:02.08
just say one just means a whether two or more whatever is considered or not drop it seem seen

1391
02:01:02.08 --> 02:01:10.56
toss me one beer I want big war hero as opposed to I'm two big war heroes they see

1392
02:01:10.56 --> 02:01:17.36
I'm saying I'm a big war you see you see the translates right that's why you're here man

1393
02:01:17.36 --> 02:01:23.92
they're working down that pigeon if need be yes yes all right so okay becoming better so

1394
02:01:23.92 --> 02:01:28.64
I was thinking about this the other day you know my neighbors are over and they ask hey do you

1395
02:01:28.64 --> 02:01:36.32
work out every day I was like yeah well I try to you know the whole deal you work out every

1396
02:01:36.32 --> 02:01:41.68
day right juggle every day like seven days a week I mean that's kind of the plan that you're

1397
02:01:41.68 --> 02:01:48.24
still I will try and work out every single day sometimes you have a travel day you know the

1398
02:01:48.24 --> 02:01:54.88
flights at six fifteen I got to bed at eleven do I am I gonna get up at three fifteen or or no even

1399
02:01:54.88 --> 02:02:00.72
earlier than that three no my body could probably use the extra sleep more than it could use the

1400
02:02:00.72 --> 02:02:07.52
workout yeah but I know that there are days like that out there so therefore I don't voluntarily

1401
02:02:07.52 --> 02:02:19.52
take days off yeah so and kind yeah I dig it same deal more or less you know but why like why do

1402
02:02:19.52 --> 02:02:24.08
work out every day I'm not saying you shouldn't I'm just saying you ever think about like why do you work out

1403
02:02:24.08 --> 02:02:31.68
every day you know and then like how do you work out every day like what like why why why I work out

1404
02:02:31.68 --> 02:02:36.16
every day so I can say and shape bro yeah but you don't have to work out every day to stay and shape okay

1405
02:02:36.16 --> 02:02:41.68
things there has to be more to it than that I think it's good for you mentally and physically

1406
02:02:41.68 --> 02:02:47.84
just see there you go mentally right mentally that's so that's such a broad thing to say though

1407
02:02:47.84 --> 02:02:52.88
too and I mean that in a good way I don't mean it like whoa that's a copper I'm not saying that

1408
02:02:52.88 --> 02:02:59.04
I'm saying like that's yeah mentally man that's a big deal mentally where that's part of like

1409
02:02:59.76 --> 02:03:04.72
essentially like your life you know it's part of like who you are you know like that's the discipline

1410
02:03:05.28 --> 02:03:11.76
yeah and there's a lot of things like that but they seem like real small because so many people do it

1411
02:03:11.76 --> 02:03:16.56
you know like you know some people they they make their bed every single day right there's that

1412
02:03:16.56 --> 02:03:21.12
and then there's like okay then you get all the way down the spectrum like obvious things like

1413
02:03:21.12 --> 02:03:28.96
all I brush my teeth every day I would it you know but man you're essentially if you want to

1414
02:03:28.96 --> 02:03:36.56
call it the path like working out every day beyond the physical benefits and you know whatever

1415
02:03:36.56 --> 02:03:44.48
being stronger whatever working out every day is like it's one of those things where if you can adjust

1416
02:03:44.48 --> 02:03:51.76
your standard to that in that way that's a good thing that it that'll yeah that'll keep you that'll

1417
02:03:51.76 --> 02:04:01.20
keep you in a place that's like I guess that's why we call it the path it'll keep you on the path

1418
02:04:01.84 --> 02:04:07.28
yeah I think that developing a pattern is very positive right so it'll stick into the pattern

1419
02:04:07.28 --> 02:04:15.76
yeah once you deviate let's face it you lose momentum and that's a good way to develop a pattern

1420
02:04:15.76 --> 02:04:19.84
as far as staying in shape working out because let's face it like working out a lot of times

1421
02:04:19.84 --> 02:04:24.80
like we can consider that as like kind of low on the priority list for a lot of reasons and I understand

1422
02:04:25.36 --> 02:04:32.24
but if you're the cold thing is like no I work out every day the same way I freaking brush my teeth

1423
02:04:32.24 --> 02:04:38.32
every day you know it's like part of the day I floss my teeth every day yeah yeah so it's like one of

1424
02:04:38.32 --> 02:04:42.08
those things that started when I joined the navy what floss they said floss your teeth every day

1425
02:04:42.08 --> 02:04:50.08
I was like okay and I started doing it every day yeah see and that's good it's the reason I

1426
02:04:50.08 --> 02:04:54.72
laugh is because it's funny how it's like that simple for you yeah like good like they're just

1427
02:04:54.72 --> 02:04:58.64
those you floss oh yeah you get told that your whole life but then they're like okay

1428
02:04:58.64 --> 02:05:03.92
they say foster tea every day oh yeah Roger that so yeah hey how about this workout every day

1429
02:05:03.92 --> 02:05:08.48
every single day it's good move well but it is a good way what you're what you get I feel like

1430
02:05:08.48 --> 02:05:11.84
there's some place where you're going with this I feel like this is a building up to some

1431
02:05:11.84 --> 02:05:19.36
statement yeah and here's it's not building up to statement it's kind of rude because I was thinking

1432
02:05:19.36 --> 02:05:25.12
you had some kind of philosophical yoree command yeah I mean but basically what your saying is

1433
02:05:25.12 --> 02:05:29.84
workout every day I have a head of it's not that long as it's kind of made to be wondering

1434
02:05:29.84 --> 02:05:33.36
I'm telling you why you should work out every day because let's face it like if you just say hey

1435
02:05:33.36 --> 02:05:38.16
workout every day where there's a lot of pushback you can get like no you need rest days no you need

1436
02:05:38.16 --> 02:05:43.20
you know like there's you know this is big philosophy to it but working out every day just like

1437
02:05:43.20 --> 02:05:49.52
how you said which I'm glad you did by the way it's it's a it's a mental thing yes and of course

1438
02:05:49.52 --> 02:05:55.60
physical but this obvious yeah some mental things so and then you additionally you said to you know

1439
02:05:55.60 --> 02:06:00.16
make it a what a routine or whatever like it's just part of your day develop a pattern

1440
02:06:00.16 --> 02:06:04.64
develop a pattern yes exactly right that's a good way to develop a pattern is you just

1441
02:06:04.64 --> 02:06:10.88
automatically assume and do it every day just automatically as part of the day you know not like

1442
02:06:10.88 --> 02:06:14.56
all I want to try to get a workout into it you know it's not that it's like that's like that's it's

1443
02:06:14.56 --> 02:06:19.76
more of a given you know kind of thing is a weird thing that I'll say to people like how do you

1444
02:06:21.76 --> 02:06:26.40
sure yeah or like what do you say to yourself I don't say anything yeah I don't even

1445
02:06:26.40 --> 02:06:31.36
it's a weird thing I don't even think about it yeah I don't sit there and be like well you know

1446
02:06:31.36 --> 02:06:36.56
I have worked out for five days straight so I really probably don't actually need to work out today

1447
02:06:36.56 --> 02:06:40.64
I could you you know it's like you know I actually read once four years ago in a muscle and fitness

1448
02:06:40.64 --> 02:06:44.88
magazine that you know five days in a row is a bit too much to work out you should take that

1449
02:06:44.88 --> 02:06:51.60
whatever day off you always can find 80 million ways to rationalize it's not the Bulgarians actually

1450
02:06:51.60 --> 02:06:55.52
on their periodization cycle they only took you know like there's a million different

1451
02:06:55.52 --> 02:06:59.68
I was reading about Michael Phelps and even though he trained hard there was always one day a week

1452
02:06:59.68 --> 02:07:04.32
that he would just rest like everyone's got a million different rationalizing things that you can

1453
02:07:04.32 --> 02:07:10.000
put in your head yeah even though there's a good go that's that's the rationalizing thing

1454
02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:18.08
there's a there's a TV show that it's called alone and it's TV show going alone they put

1455
02:07:18.08 --> 02:07:22.56
people out in the wilderness I heard about it on Joe Rogan because he had one of the winners on the show

1456
02:07:23.76 --> 02:07:28.24
and I didn't even hear that I just heard Joe Rogan mentioned it he was like yeah the show

1457
02:07:28.24 --> 02:07:33.84
was crazy they put them out and so I was with my wife and my youngest daughter and they were

1458
02:07:33.84 --> 02:07:39.92
looking for something to watch and I go I go well hey there's a show called alone it's about

1459
02:07:39.92 --> 02:07:47.04
being alone in the wilderness long story short but everyone quits and you you the show goes on until

1460
02:07:47.04 --> 02:07:55.36
only one person is left everyone else quits so they're in different places there alone in the wilderness

1461
02:07:55.92 --> 02:08:00.80
they're alone in the wilderness oh with each other though no there alone yeah yeah yeah

1462
02:08:00.80 --> 02:08:07.44
alone so as you watch this you see people and they have cameras with them so they're talking to

1463
02:08:07.44 --> 02:08:14.88
themselves and it's been funny to watch because you can see people when they're gonna quit and

1464
02:08:14.88 --> 02:08:19.36
you're like oh they're rationaling so now now I've got my youngest daughter who's 11

1465
02:08:20.72 --> 02:08:27.28
when someone starts rationalizing she says oh he's rationalizing because you know someone will say

1466
02:08:27.92 --> 02:08:31.68
no I could stay out here for a long time but you know I really miss my family yeah yeah and you

1467
02:08:31.68 --> 02:08:37.44
know he's rationalizing or or I just don't know if it's worth you know what this is doing to my body I've

1468
02:08:37.44 --> 02:08:42.16
done some stuff to start tough to my body and I'm sort of think about even though the money would be

1469
02:08:42.16 --> 02:08:49.92
nice but so we start rationalizing and the reason I mean you'd see that in zeal training

1470
02:08:50.64 --> 02:08:56.24
in zeal training you'd see someone say you know I don't know if I you know I've actually probably

1471
02:08:56.24 --> 02:09:00.08
going to get married and I don't know if it's the right thing to do to put my girlfriend through this

1472
02:09:00.08 --> 02:09:05.52
and you're like okay yeah yeah for sure definitely don't want to put your wife through this

1473
02:09:06.16 --> 02:09:14.16
go quit go quit so it's so easy to rationalize things rationalization is the enemy and that

1474
02:09:14.16 --> 02:09:21.28
brings me back to where I started this which was I'm not thinking about it because I know that my

1475
02:09:21.28 --> 02:09:28.56
I know that my rationalization my powers of rationalization can can win I can get to myself

1476
02:09:28.56 --> 02:09:35.84
48 times I just quoted a muscle and fitness magazine from 1987 that said that the Bulgarians

1477
02:09:35.84 --> 02:09:40.16
ensure that they get at least one complete day of rest for every five days of working out you can

1478
02:09:40.16 --> 02:09:47.20
support any crap that you want to support if you just want to rationalize or do yourself be irrational

1479
02:09:48.48 --> 02:09:53.28
be irrational shut up do what you're supposed to do

1480
02:09:53.28 --> 02:10:05.92
yeah that a rationalizing is I'm very successful person in regards to rationalizing everyone is

1481
02:10:05.92 --> 02:10:14.000
you also know your own you know what to say you know how to like you're into being healthy right

1482
02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:19.28
and you're like yeah you know I did see that I did want just watch that YouTube video and they talked

1483
02:10:19.28 --> 02:10:27.12
about the value of rest actually is more important it's actually more important you know then diet

1484
02:10:27.92 --> 02:10:34.40
and lifting the most important thing is rest and I think I've been really I don't think I think

1485
02:10:34.40 --> 02:10:39.12
I think I actually in order to truly have discipline I need to have the discipline just to not work

1486
02:10:39.12 --> 02:10:45.52
out today yeah that's going to take discipline these are all lies they're all just lies they're all

1487
02:10:45.52 --> 02:10:54.64
just rationalization yeah I I like today I was lifting today but I was rationalizing prior to lifting

1488
02:10:55.28 --> 02:11:01.12
I was rationalizing I've been sitting there like observing myself rationalizing and what I had to

1489
02:11:01.12 --> 02:11:08.64
do is actually I was feeling a little tweak in my leg in my knee no very minor but I was like well you

1490
02:11:08.64 --> 02:11:13.20
know maybe I did you know just let that thing heal up don't want it and it's like no actually shut up

1491
02:11:13.20 --> 02:11:21.92
and I I lifted lighter but I didn't rationalize yeah I was like okay cool but hurt like good

1492
02:11:21.92 --> 02:11:30.16
you know it's a stretch of calm thing to combat rationalizing and I will all just shut up and do what you're

1493
02:11:30.16 --> 02:11:38.24
supposed to do that's one thing yeah yeah for sure but what I do or sometimes if I have the strength

1494
02:11:38.24 --> 02:11:43.92
uh is all imagine like you know how like all come with you with an issue like a work that's in

1495
02:11:43.92 --> 02:11:49.76
excuse or something and you always have some work around for the excuse every single time like somewhere

1496
02:11:49.76 --> 02:11:56.72
and it's like man if you can just imagine kind of what Jocca would say right now you know because

1497
02:11:56.72 --> 02:12:01.44
you could legitimately have a tweaking your knee you could and then varying levels it could be like

1498
02:12:01.44 --> 02:12:06.16
almost like hey if you start doing this squat routine that you have planned like you we will make it

1499
02:12:06.16 --> 02:12:11.84
work for sure you know but you can also use your other life right just some other stuff pistols

1500
02:12:11.84 --> 02:12:16.64
oh yeah you know how about that how's that sound oh yeah and a lot of times like that other stuff

1501
02:12:16.64 --> 02:12:21.44
like man I'd rather battle through the pain to be honest okay so when you go surfing sometimes

1502
02:12:21.44 --> 02:12:26.40
it's like cold miserable maybe the waves aren't that great but you know you should go

1503
02:12:26.40 --> 02:12:32.72
yeah so stoner and I we had this rule for a little while when we got to our surf spot

1504
02:12:32.72 --> 02:12:39.76
we could either go surfing or if you don't want to go surfing that's fine but now you have to swim around the

1505
02:12:39.76 --> 02:12:46.40
pier so it's like that's the deal so guess what you do you go surfing and you know you should

1506
02:12:46.40 --> 02:12:51.04
go surfing anyways even if you get two good waves it's worth it and you got to work out you know

1507
02:12:51.04 --> 02:12:56.96
you got to paddle but you're either going to so you should have an alternative like hey you can

1508
02:12:56.96 --> 02:13:04.000
either work out today or you can whatever whatever some miserable thing is that sucks worse than

1509
02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:10.96
working out yeah right yeah I'm gonna come up with that thing yeah so and actually actually do

1510
02:13:10.96 --> 02:13:16.48
that but it's still working out so it's like a version of that it's a it's a perfect uh uh it's

1511
02:13:16.48 --> 02:13:23.52
analogous to your surfing thing it's either do the work out plan or do this metcon and it's a specific

1512
02:13:23.52 --> 02:13:29.28
metcon this two of them if I did this one the the last time I did metcon I do this other one that's

1513
02:13:29.28 --> 02:13:34.000
it they're just two so it's like either do the full workout or do the metcon so if it's like man

1514
02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:38.16
if you're if you think your journey is tweeter whatever you can do the metcon that's cool yeah

1515
02:13:38.16 --> 02:13:43.44
you like that there you go and it's like it's right on the borderline of the workout and the

1516
02:13:43.44 --> 02:13:49.20
metcon suck the same yeah equally yeah but you know sometimes you're just not in the mood to do that

1517
02:13:49.20 --> 02:13:53.76
workout yeah and then sometimes you're really not in the mood to do the metcon so it's weird how

1518
02:13:53.76 --> 02:13:59.36
sometimes you want to do sometimes you would prefer to do a metcon and sometimes you would prefer to

1519
02:13:59.36 --> 02:14:05.68
lift heavy right it's okay it's okay what's not okay is I don't feel like lifting heavy so I'm

1520
02:14:05.68 --> 02:14:09.28
just not gonna do it or I don't feel like doing a metcon so I'm just gonna do anything yeah

1521
02:14:09.28 --> 02:14:13.36
exactly what you want to do that I like that option you can either do this or that and I do that

1522
02:14:13.36 --> 02:14:18.88
to a certain level you know if I if I just whatever I don't feel like doing anything that's

1523
02:14:18.88 --> 02:14:24.56
gonna be a metcon scenario I bet cool I'm gonna lift heavy you know and I'm gonna grind it out

1524
02:14:24.56 --> 02:14:28.48
too and I'm not like I'm gonna say oh well I'm just gonna you know yeah no I'm gonna get some

1525
02:14:28.48 --> 02:14:32.72
that's why I like the metcon because the metcon is very specific like you either did it or you

1526
02:14:32.72 --> 02:14:37.44
just didn't do it correctly you know kind of thing like it has the the rest in between

1527
02:14:37.44 --> 02:14:42.08
each rest basically circuit training yeah essentially and I got to do a certain weight a certain

1528
02:14:42.08 --> 02:14:47.04
amount of reps per thing it's so it's there it's not like oh I'm gonna go like or I'm gonna

1529
02:14:47.04 --> 02:14:52.16
slack it's kind of hard to slack because it's like real glaring if you do so yeah you're choosing

1530
02:14:52.16 --> 02:14:55.44
one or the other I don't care what you're in the mood for a night in the mood for like you got to

1531
02:14:55.44 --> 02:15:02.48
do one you know but if you so I always have that in play always yeah and it works yeah it's good to

1532
02:15:02.48 --> 02:15:12.96
give yourself a shitty alternative yes yes it is in these cases yeah well anyway hopefully

1533
02:15:12.96 --> 02:15:18.56
we are on the path whether you're working out every day or not I'd say I recommend to

1534
02:15:18.56 --> 02:15:22.08
work out every day here's the thing if you're hurting yourself or something like that don't do

1535
02:15:22.08 --> 02:15:28.72
that work out yeah yeah for sure like do something that's gonna injure you yeah but don't do nothing

1536
02:15:29.36 --> 02:15:34.72
don't do nothing do a very deliberate yeah work out every day and the point is there too is like

1537
02:15:34.72 --> 02:15:41.12
that it after while it does just become normal yeah like just like making coffee or you know like

1538
02:15:41.12 --> 02:15:45.44
every day it's just all that's sort of just what you do every single day it's like right it becomes

1539
02:15:45.44 --> 02:15:50.72
that you know and boom you're a new person boom just like that just like that you know like we're

1540
02:15:50.72 --> 02:15:56.24
all in the path we're working out every day hey look you joins get sore I get it right my knees actually

1541
02:15:56.24 --> 02:16:06.24
sore actually sore but I did squat super hard yeah you know the kind where mentally you go into like

1542
02:16:06.24 --> 02:16:15.60
getting yeah whatever in squats too and so mentally you kind of it's almost like a you turn off

1543
02:16:15.60 --> 02:16:19.92
a certain part of your mind you know so and you're just your body just has to like basically

1544
02:16:19.92 --> 02:16:25.36
facilitate their ass but then when you're done when your mind switches back on you're like just

1545
02:16:25.36 --> 02:16:29.76
in pain you know how you got to basically pay the price of mentally afterwards you're sitting

1546
02:16:29.76 --> 02:16:35.60
on the road to recovery which is cool but you know it was one of those scenarios and yeah my knees

1547
02:16:35.60 --> 02:16:42.16
were weird strangely sore on the inside I don't know oddly it's fully healed now too by the way

1548
02:16:42.16 --> 02:16:48.08
those two days ago nonetheless point is the next few joints get sore mine too jocals too when you get

1549
02:16:48.08 --> 02:16:54.32
older we're all getting older I know no matter how old you are we're not getting older no but like

1550
02:16:54.32 --> 02:16:58.72
everyone goes oh it's because you're getting older no because you're not taking care you're taking care

1551
02:16:58.72 --> 02:17:06.32
less yeah and also like when when I was younger you have sore yeah it's not worse yeah my hands

1552
02:17:06.32 --> 02:17:13.76
are not really worse I feel like my capacity maybe my enthusiasm sometimes less but that might be

1553
02:17:13.76 --> 02:17:18.000
just because I got more stuff going on as an adult you see I don't know no the last if you're

1554
02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:24.08
joints of sore don't worry joculous when did you become an adult how are you I want to say like

1555
02:17:24.08 --> 02:17:32.32
mid 30's I think it was mid never to be honest but I don't know I think it's a slowly slow

1556
02:17:32.32 --> 02:17:38.48
gradual we're still heading there kids kids kids kids move that forward when you have kids

1557
02:17:39.12 --> 02:17:45.92
you start to become an adult pretty quickly yeah yeah yeah yeah certainly I mean I mean you've got

1558
02:17:45.92 --> 02:17:52.08
like human that now rely on you for your food for their food so I've got for everything and everything

1559
02:17:52.08 --> 02:17:59.52
yeah like the roof yeah like and health health for the guidance life yeah whole freaking

1560
02:17:59.52 --> 02:18:03.52
existence bunch of things we're talking about yeah it's wrecking second switch on the adult

1561
02:18:03.52 --> 02:18:09.36
circuits for sure how old you're oldest seven yeah so I was probably right probably mid 30's

1562
02:18:09.36 --> 02:18:15.84
you started kind of moving in the direction of yeah I think so too nonetheless I don't have

1563
02:18:15.84 --> 02:18:22.96
sore joints at the moment that is because when I was trying to tell our everyone the people

1564
02:18:22.96 --> 02:18:28.48
our people joc was supplementation called jockel fueled the joint stuff is joint warfare

1565
02:18:29.44 --> 02:18:35.68
there is also super krill oil which has other health benefits by the way but anyway in combination

1566
02:18:35.68 --> 02:18:41.36
this will keep your joints in the game working out seven days a week working out five days a week

1567
02:18:41.36 --> 02:18:49.04
whatever working out nine days a week all of that stuff these will keep them together the whole

1568
02:18:49.04 --> 02:18:57.04
time you can be worried about your gains not your joints they check them out hey also vitamin D

1569
02:18:57.92 --> 02:19:05.44
now we're in the midst of the pandemic and everybody is saying take vitamin D thankfully

1570
02:19:05.44 --> 02:19:11.92
we may go out of the day vitamin D three get some of that you can also get cold war which is

1571
02:19:11.92 --> 02:19:18.88
immune health which again these are products that we've had and it's pretty cool that a lot of

1572
02:19:18.88 --> 02:19:25.76
people are recommending them right now so you can stay healthy and then on top of all this working

1573
02:19:25.76 --> 02:19:32.64
out that you're doing your prior to need some what echolex to call additional protein yes additional

1574
02:19:32.64 --> 02:19:39.84
well because you know there's a debate if you will to be an animal lifestyle of how much protein

1575
02:19:39.84 --> 02:19:46.80
you should know so if you want a supplement protein I read out of the list of this right now

1576
02:19:46.80 --> 02:19:54.96
yeah but for zero yeah you know there's four in the last it doesn't matter because for those six

1577
02:19:54.96 --> 02:20:00.16
people there you go there you go there you go there you go there you go there you go there you go

1578
02:20:00.16 --> 02:20:03.92
yes nonetheless if you're going to sell them in protein you might as well have it in the form of

1579
02:20:03.92 --> 02:20:10.72
dessert that's a smoke is I know strange name I get it unless supplement you're protein like a

1580
02:20:10.72 --> 02:20:16.000
dessert but that we got some kids protein to warrior kid protein because why would you feed

1581
02:20:16.000 --> 02:20:20.72
your kid something that's actual poison you wouldn't do it you'd get them warrior kid milk they will

1582
02:20:20.72 --> 02:20:26.40
love it you will love that they're having it they will be healthier stronger smarter better they're

1583
02:20:26.40 --> 02:20:33.20
going to have a massive deadlift first sure just a hundred percent white tea we got that and we

1584
02:20:33.20 --> 02:20:41.44
also got these cans of what we call discipline go is it an energy drink you know what it is because

1585
02:20:41.44 --> 02:20:49.60
it gives you energy but it gives you real energy not a not a lie not just a not just a massive

1586
02:20:49.60 --> 02:20:56.64
hit of caffeine 300 milligrams of caffeine look you you inject 300 milligrams of caffeine into a piece of wood

1587
02:20:56.64 --> 02:21:02.96
and it starts to get excited but after a little while it's like very quickly it's back to just

1588
02:21:02.96 --> 02:21:09.44
being wood you put a bunch of sugar into into a rat and it gets all excited that's fake energy

1589
02:21:09.44 --> 02:21:15.20
this real energy it's got it's not got no sugar in it but it still tastes good sweet with

1590
02:21:15.20 --> 02:21:20.80
my paparoma yeah well here's the thing the blah blah and I get it and I understand why you said

1591
02:21:20.80 --> 02:21:24.64
blah blah because it's like yeah these are all these numbers and all this stuff will

1592
02:21:24.64 --> 02:21:31.04
but man I kind of looked into it I did look into it by the way and so preserve it is sweet

1593
02:21:31.04 --> 02:21:36.48
and there's like these things that is the things that make normal energy drinks bad for you yeah

1594
02:21:36.48 --> 02:21:40.16
yeah the ones that are bad for you and you know there's a bunch of energy drinks so I can't

1595
02:21:40.16 --> 02:21:45.04
say so it's hard to for me in the spirit of accuracy to say all all energy drinks are all this

1596
02:21:45.04 --> 02:21:54.000
are all that but the preservatives and artificial sweeteners are straight up plays in straight up

1597
02:21:54.000 --> 02:21:59.36
but they do sweeten or they do preserve or do you know and there's these list of very specific

1598
02:21:59.36 --> 02:22:04.88
things that they put in the only reason they're in there is not to help you yeah it's to help

1599
02:22:04.88 --> 02:22:10.72
the drink it helps the drink yes so whatever I'm trying to say is we don't have any of those

1600
02:22:10.72 --> 02:22:17.52
things in order to not put chemicals in there to preserve it we paste your eyes it like what

1601
02:22:17.52 --> 02:22:24.40
you do with milk yes so and in order to sweeten it we've only got monk fruit which is good for you

1602
02:22:24.40 --> 02:22:29.68
monk fruit is good for you so anyways all these different items you can get it you can get

1603
02:22:29.68 --> 02:22:37.44
origin main dot com you can also get them at the vitamin shop and we're a little we're about to

1604
02:22:37.44 --> 02:22:44.24
enter a new market in the world you know when people say oh I really wish this stuff was available

1605
02:22:44.24 --> 02:22:49.36
here or there I mean we're moving in that direction it's starting starting with vitamin shop

1606
02:22:49.36 --> 02:22:55.60
next thing we're going into is a place called wawwaw which is a convenience store most of East Coast

1607
02:22:55.60 --> 02:23:02.80
we're starting in Florida and Virginia if you live in those areas be on the lookout because

1608
02:23:02.80 --> 02:23:09.92
you'll be able to walk into a waw and clean out the shelf clean out the shelf get yourself some

1609
02:23:09.92 --> 02:23:15.60
dyspongo try the different flavors and yeah you'll get that little you'll get that little

1610
02:23:15.60 --> 02:23:26.32
mid-morning heater and that you won't be supposed to drink crash really like yeah yeah and and being

1611
02:23:26.32 --> 02:23:32.32
in the in the store is like especially like a convenient store scenario whatever it's it makes it it

1612
02:23:32.32 --> 02:23:38.32
does this is a big deal in this sense where right now and I get it like you you or here shipment you

1613
02:23:38.32 --> 02:23:43.92
know you get it whether it be online or whatever or find a vitamin shop for sure but when it's

1614
02:23:43.92 --> 02:23:49.20
out the store you can just sort of stop and get one kind of thing on the way here on the way there

1615
02:23:49.20 --> 02:23:55.92
whatever it makes it a whole different process yeah way more convenient if you were probably

1616
02:23:55.92 --> 02:24:00.64
why they call it convenient stores by the way yeah unless that's a good that's good news right there

1617
02:24:01.36 --> 02:24:05.76
yeah so dyspongo so what it's called in the can I don't know if you mentioned that for those who

1618
02:24:05.76 --> 02:24:13.36
may not have known that got it thank you so anyway yes or origin mean dot com yeah get it there also other

1622
02:24:30.72 --> 02:24:37.20
there American made boots works of art i've heard them be referred to as works of art made in a

1623
02:24:37.20 --> 02:24:44.08
American just made Pete Roberts isn't so happy well it's accurate i agree with the statement yeah they are

1624
02:24:44.08 --> 02:24:54.000
this is works of art and also the preservation of a culture of creation and manufacturer that's

1625
02:24:54.000 --> 02:25:04.32
what's happening this is a loss this is a dying art a dying capability that is now being preserved

1626
02:25:04.32 --> 02:25:12.72
whether it's the the manufacturing of the cloth to make the geese whether it's the manufacturing of the

1627
02:25:12.72 --> 02:25:21.68
boots whether it's the the sewing and fabrication of the jeans all of it is a preservation of a manufacturing

1628
02:25:23.92 --> 02:25:33.52
a manufacturing thread that ties America together so we're not going to let it die by the way and we
