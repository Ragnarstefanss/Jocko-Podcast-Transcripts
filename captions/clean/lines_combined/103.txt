00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000 This is Jockel Podcast number 103 with echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink.
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000 Good evening echo.
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000 Good evening.
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.20 Whilst lying at Windchester, young as I was in the profession, I was picked out amongst
00:00:16.20 --> 00:00:22.000 others to perform a piece of duty that, for many years afterwards, remain deeply
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.80 impressed upon my mind and gave me the first impression of the stern duties of a soldier's
00:00:27.80 --> 00:00:28.80 life.
00:00:28.80 --> 00:00:36.20 A private of the 70th Regiment had deserted from that corps, and afterwards, enlisted
00:00:36.20 --> 00:00:38.80 into several other regiments.
00:00:38.80 --> 00:00:45.80 Indeed, I was told at the time that 16 different times he had received the bounty and
00:00:45.80 --> 00:00:48.20 then stolen off.
00:00:48.20 --> 00:00:53.40 Being however, caught at last he was brought to trial at Portsmouth and sentenced by
00:00:53.40 --> 00:00:59.32 General Court Marshall to be shot.
00:00:59.32 --> 00:01:04.80 As the execution would be a good hint to us, youngins, there were four lads picked
00:01:04.80 --> 00:01:12.76 out of our corps to assist in this piece of duty, myself being one of the number chosen.
00:01:12.76 --> 00:01:18.000 Besides these men, four soldiers from three other regiments were ordered on the firing
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.52 party, making 16 at all.
00:01:22.52 --> 00:01:29.72 The place of execution was Portsdown Hill and the different regiments assembled must have
00:01:29.72 --> 00:01:36.32 composed a force of about 15,000 men having been assembled from the Isle of White, from
00:01:36.32 --> 00:01:41.80 Chai Sester, Gauceport and other places.
00:01:41.80 --> 00:01:49.40 The site was very imposing and appeared to make a deep impression on all there.
00:01:49.40 --> 00:01:55.88 As for myself, I felt that I would have given a good round sum, had I possessed it to have
00:01:55.88 --> 00:02:01.36 been in any other situation rather than the one, rather than the one which I now found
00:02:01.36 --> 00:02:03.72 myself.
00:02:03.72 --> 00:02:10.60 And when I looked into the faces of my companions, I saw by the pallor and exited, depicted
00:02:10.60 --> 00:02:17.40 in each countenance, the reflection of my own feelings.
00:02:17.40 --> 00:02:24.08 And all was ready, we removed to the front and the culprit was brought out.
00:02:24.08 --> 00:02:30.60 He made a short speech to the parade, acknowledging the justice of his sentence and that drinking
00:02:30.60 --> 00:02:37.08 an evil company had brought the punishment upon him.
00:02:37.08 --> 00:02:43.84 He behaved himself firmly and well and did not seem to flinch at all.
00:02:43.84 --> 00:02:50.36 After being blindfolded, he was desired to kneel down behind a coffin which was placed
00:02:50.36 --> 00:02:57.52 on the ground and the drum major of the depot giving us an expressive glance.
00:02:57.52 --> 00:03:02.56 We immediately commenced to loading.
00:03:02.56 --> 00:03:10.04 This was done in the deepest silence and the next moment we were primed in ready.
00:03:10.04 --> 00:03:15.88 It was then a dreadful pause for a few moments and the drum major again looking towards
00:03:15.88 --> 00:03:22.76 us, gave us the signal agreed upon before, a flourish of his cane.
00:03:22.76 --> 00:03:28.16 And we leveled and fired.
00:03:28.16 --> 00:03:34.24 We had been previously strictly enjoying to be steady and take good aim and the poor fellow
00:03:34.24 --> 00:03:39.64 pierced by several balls, fell heavily upon his back.
00:03:39.64 --> 00:03:45.20 As he lay with his arms, pinion to his sides, I observed that his hands waved for a few
00:03:45.20 --> 00:03:52.36 moments, like the fins on a fish, when in the agonies of death.
00:03:52.36 --> 00:03:59.96 The drum major also observed the movement and making another signal for of our party immediately
00:03:59.96 --> 00:04:05.88 stepped up to the post-rate body and placing the muzzles of their pieces to the head, fired
00:04:05.88 --> 00:04:10.52 and put him out of his misery.
00:04:10.52 --> 00:04:16.12 The different regiments then fell back by companies and the word being given to March
00:04:16.12 --> 00:04:18.60 past in slow time.
00:04:18.60 --> 00:04:24.48 When each company came in line with the body, the word was given to Mark time and then
00:04:24.48 --> 00:04:32.28 eyes left in order that we all might observe the terrible example.
00:04:32.28 --> 00:04:42.44 We then moved onwards and marched from the ground to our different quarters.
00:04:42.44 --> 00:04:52.24 And that is from a book called Recollections of Rifleman Harris, who was an enlisted soldier
00:04:52.24 --> 00:04:59.44 for the British Army during the Napoleonic Wars and that was his welcome to the Army.
00:04:59.44 --> 00:05:07.44 He had been in for about three weeks of service when he had to stand and execute a fellow
00:05:07.44 --> 00:05:18.80 soldier for basically being drunk and disorderly, not doing what he was supposed to do.
00:05:18.80 --> 00:05:25.80 Essentially, he was being executed for being a human being.
00:05:25.80 --> 00:05:29.92 That was the introduction to military service for Rifleman Harris.
00:05:29.92 --> 00:05:33.80 Rifleman Harris's full name was Benjamin Randall Harris.
00:05:33.80 --> 00:05:37.68 He enlisted in 1803.
00:05:37.68 --> 00:05:46.56 He fought all over Europe in the peninsula war, which posed bourbon Spain, the kingdom of Portugal
00:05:46.56 --> 00:05:53.60 and the British Empire against Napoleon's French Empire and boat-apartists Spain.
00:05:53.60 --> 00:05:57.20 And also the Duchy of Warsaw.
00:05:57.20 --> 00:06:09.04 This is a war where they have daggers and swords and bayonets and mounted cavalry charges.
00:06:09.04 --> 00:06:19.36 They have cannons and they used a lot of muzzle loading rifles, which a skilled rifleman
00:06:19.36 --> 00:06:27.84 could load and fire about three times per minute, accurate out to about 200 yards.
00:06:27.84 --> 00:06:34.80 Very different from the weapons that we have now, which can fire three rounds in a second.
00:06:34.80 --> 00:06:40.96 And our very accurate out to 800 yards, a thousand yards and some sniper weapons way further
00:06:40.96 --> 00:06:44.60 than that.
00:06:44.60 --> 00:06:51.60 But even though these weapons are different from the weapons we see in modern warfare,
00:06:51.60 --> 00:06:57.80 as always in the end, it is men.
00:06:57.80 --> 00:07:08.40 It is human beings on the battlefield, bleeding, sweating, starving, suffering, killing,
00:07:08.40 --> 00:07:13.76 and being killed.
00:07:13.76 --> 00:07:24.32 This is a little bit more about riflemen, Harris, going back to the book.
00:07:24.32 --> 00:07:28.60 My father was a shepherd and I was a sheep boy from my earliest youth.
00:07:28.60 --> 00:07:32.88 Indeed as soon as almost I could run, I began helping my father to look after the sheep
00:07:32.88 --> 00:07:38.40 on the downs of blanford in Dorsetcher, where I was born.
00:07:38.40 --> 00:07:42.76 Whilst I continued to tend the flocks and herds under my charge, and occasionally in the
00:07:42.76 --> 00:07:47.52 long winter nights, I learned the art of making shoes.
00:07:47.52 --> 00:07:54.28 I grew a hearty little chap and was one fine day in the year of 1802, drawn as a soldier
00:07:54.28 --> 00:07:57.64 for the army of reserve.
00:07:57.64 --> 00:08:02.72 Thus without troubling myself much about the change, which was about to take place in
00:08:02.72 --> 00:08:09.52 the quiet of my routine days, I was drafted into the 66th regiment of foot.
00:08:09.52 --> 00:08:14.72 It did goodbye to my shepherd companions and was obliged to leave my father without
00:08:14.72 --> 00:08:17.56 an assistant to collect his flocks.
00:08:17.56 --> 00:08:21.84 Just as he was beginning more than ever to require one.
00:08:21.84 --> 00:08:30.12 Nay indeed, I may say to want tending and looking after himself, for old age and infirmary,
00:08:30.12 --> 00:08:32.20 we're coming on him.
00:08:32.20 --> 00:08:37.26 His hair was growing white as the sleet of our downs and his countenance becoming as
00:08:37.26 --> 00:08:41.18 furrowed as the plowed fields around.
00:08:41.18 --> 00:08:46.46 However, as I had no choice in the matter, it was quite as well that I did not grieve over
00:08:46.46 --> 00:08:48.42 my fate.
00:08:48.42 --> 00:08:53.66 My father tried hard to buy me off and would have persuaded the sergeant of the 66th
00:08:53.66 --> 00:08:58.90 that I was of no use as a soldier, from having maimed my right hand by breaking the four
00:08:58.90 --> 00:09:01.78 finger when I was a child.
00:09:01.78 --> 00:09:06.46 The sergeant, however, said I was just the sort of little chap he wanted.
00:09:06.46 --> 00:09:15.38 And off he went, carrying me amongst a batch of recruits he had collected away with him.
00:09:15.38 --> 00:09:18.22 She purter.
00:09:18.22 --> 00:09:21.86 Dad's getting old, army comes and gets you.
00:09:21.86 --> 00:09:23.86 That's the way it works.
00:09:23.86 --> 00:09:31.98 England, 1802.
00:09:31.98 --> 00:09:38.78 Now he travels around a little bit and eventually ends up in Dublin.
00:09:38.78 --> 00:09:44.14 Here we go back to the book, whilst in Dublin, I one day saw a core of the 95th rifles and
00:09:44.14 --> 00:09:49.22 fell so in love with their smart, dashing and devil-may care appearance that nothing would
00:09:49.22 --> 00:09:53.02 serve me until I was a rifleman myself.
00:09:53.02 --> 00:09:57.42 So on arriving at Castle One Day and falling in with the recruiting party of that regiment
00:09:57.42 --> 00:10:00.42 I volunteered into the second battalion.
00:10:00.42 --> 00:10:03.54 This recruiting party were all Irishmen.
00:10:03.54 --> 00:10:09.18 And I had been sent over from England to collect amongst others men from the Irish militia
00:10:09.18 --> 00:10:12.02 and were just about to return to England.
00:10:12.02 --> 00:10:17.46 I think they were as reckless and devil-may care, a set of men I'd ever been beheld either
00:10:17.46 --> 00:10:19.86 before or since.
00:10:19.86 --> 00:10:28.06 So these riflemen, I would say from what I read about them, they're almost like a special
00:10:28.06 --> 00:10:34.86 ops unit and one big difference is they're wearing red jackets like the Brits were
00:10:34.86 --> 00:10:35.86 wear at this time.
00:10:35.86 --> 00:10:36.86 They wore green.
00:10:36.86 --> 00:10:43.30 So they were a little bit different and they had more accurate rifles and they would fight.
00:10:43.30 --> 00:10:47.90 They would do what they called skirmishing which is fundamentally cover-move.
00:10:47.90 --> 00:10:54.34 They'd shoot and they'd maneuver and they'd act like little special operations troops out
00:10:54.34 --> 00:10:55.34 there.
00:10:55.34 --> 00:11:03.30 Of course it's interesting to me when I hear this guy talking about the first time he saw
00:11:03.30 --> 00:11:06.86 someone that looked a little bit like a special operations troop.
00:11:06.86 --> 00:11:10.90 He said, well he actually says, I fell in love with it.
00:11:10.90 --> 00:11:18.10 That's very much how I felt as I was growing up the more I saw the special ops.
00:11:18.10 --> 00:11:20.38 He didn't even need to be special ops for me.
00:11:20.38 --> 00:11:22.66 It was just someone in the military.
00:11:22.66 --> 00:11:25.50 Then he was already in the military, so now he's looking for the next thing.
00:11:25.50 --> 00:11:27.22 What's the next thing going to be?
00:11:27.22 --> 00:11:32.06 And here he ends up as a rifleman.
00:11:32.06 --> 00:11:34.14 So he's now a rifleman.
00:11:34.14 --> 00:11:38.74 He joins, he moves over to their regiment and here we go back to the book.
00:11:38.74 --> 00:11:43.18 The next day we marched for Ashford and Kent where I joined the 95th rifles and about six
00:11:43.18 --> 00:11:47.38 months after my joining four companies of the second battalion were ordered on the expedition
00:11:47.38 --> 00:11:48.86 to Denmark.
00:11:48.86 --> 00:11:55.10 We embarked at deal and sailing for hostile shores landed on a little place called I think
00:11:55.10 --> 00:11:57.30 Scarlet Island.
00:11:57.30 --> 00:12:01.50 The expedition consisted of about 30,000 men.
00:12:01.50 --> 00:12:06.74 And at the moment of our getting on shore, the whole force set up one simultaneous and
00:12:06.74 --> 00:12:12.70 tremendous cheer, a sound I cannot describe, it seemed so inspiring.
00:12:12.70 --> 00:12:17.46 This indeed was the first time of my hearing the style in which our men give tongue when
00:12:17.46 --> 00:12:19.98 they get near the enemy.
00:12:19.98 --> 00:12:25.82 The laughter words my ears became pretty well accustomed to such sounds.
00:12:25.82 --> 00:12:30.38 As soon as we got on shore, the rifles were pushed forward and we said the rifles he's
00:12:30.38 --> 00:12:32.46 talking about his guys.
00:12:32.46 --> 00:12:37.90 The rifles were pushed forward as the advance in chain order through some thick woods
00:12:37.90 --> 00:12:39.26 of fur.
00:12:39.26 --> 00:12:43.10 And when we had cleared these woods and approached Copenhagen centuries were posted on the
00:12:43.10 --> 00:12:47.42 roads and openings leading toward the town in order to intercept all commerce and prevent
00:12:47.42 --> 00:12:49.26 all supplies.
00:12:49.26 --> 00:12:53.66 Such posts were occupied for about three days and nights whilst the town was being fired
00:12:53.66 --> 00:12:55.98 upon by our shipping.
00:12:55.98 --> 00:13:01.22 I rather think this was the first time of the Kongrive rockets being brought into play
00:13:01.22 --> 00:13:03.50 and they rushed through the air in the dark.
00:13:03.50 --> 00:13:09.34 They appeared so like so many fiery serpents creating I should think terrible dismay among
00:13:09.34 --> 00:13:12.94 the besieged the Kongrive rockets.
00:13:12.94 --> 00:13:16.42 They basically looked like giant bottle rockets in a way.
00:13:16.42 --> 00:13:22.42 And they got at this time they were getting their range out to 1500 2000 meters.
00:13:22.42 --> 00:13:26.50 So it was a pretty crazy weapon.
00:13:26.50 --> 00:13:31.50 And I can tell you rockets in this day and age have become fairly accurate but in those
00:13:31.50 --> 00:13:37.42 days probably about as accurate as a bottle rocket is my guess.
00:13:37.42 --> 00:13:42.02 Back to the book as the main army came up we advanced and got as near under the walls
00:13:42.02 --> 00:13:45.90 of the place as we could without being endangered by the fire from our own shipping.
00:13:45.90 --> 00:13:47.62 So what's happening right there is cover move.
00:13:47.62 --> 00:13:51.62 The shipping is bombarding and these guys are advancing as close as they can where they
00:13:51.62 --> 00:13:56.70 are not going to get killed by their own fire from the ships.
00:13:56.70 --> 00:14:00.82 We now received orders ourselves to commence firing and the rattling of the guns I
00:14:00.82 --> 00:14:03.46 shall not easily forget.
00:14:03.46 --> 00:14:08.58 I felt so much exhilarated that I could hardly keep back and was checked by the commander
00:14:08.58 --> 00:14:12.70 of the company who called me by my name to keep my place.
00:14:12.70 --> 00:14:19.90 Throughout this time my front rank man, a tall fellow named Jack Johnson, showed a disposition
00:14:19.90 --> 00:14:25.86 as though the firing had a effect on him the reverse of what it had on many others of the
00:14:25.86 --> 00:14:26.86 company.
00:14:26.86 --> 00:14:32.90 For he seemed inclined to hang back and once or twice turned around in my face.
00:14:32.90 --> 00:14:37.02 I was a rear rank man and porting my peace in the excitement of the moment.
00:14:37.02 --> 00:14:42.38 I score that if he did not keep his ground I would shoot him dead on the spot.
00:14:42.38 --> 00:14:47.98 So that he found it he would go on so that he found it would be quite as dangerous for him
00:14:47.98 --> 00:14:51.02 to return as to go on.
00:14:51.02 --> 00:14:56.58 I feel sorry to record the warmth of courage of this man but I do so with the less pain
00:14:56.58 --> 00:15:01.10 it gives me the opportunity of saying that during my many years of arduous service it
00:15:01.10 --> 00:15:07.42 is the only instance I remember of a British soldier endeavoring to hold back when his comrades
00:15:07.42 --> 00:15:10.26 were moving forward.
00:15:10.26 --> 00:15:15.62 Indeed Johnson was never held again an estimation among the rifle corps.
00:15:15.62 --> 00:15:19.86 For the story got wind that I had threatened to shoot him for cowardice in the field and
00:15:19.86 --> 00:15:24.66 Lieutenant Cox mentioned to the Colonel that he'd overheard my doing so and such was the
00:15:24.66 --> 00:15:34.90 contempt the man was held in by the rifles that he was soon afterwards removed.
00:15:34.90 --> 00:15:36.30 There you go.
00:15:36.30 --> 00:15:43.10 First time under fire it's interesting how rifle man Harris first time under fire he wants
00:15:43.10 --> 00:15:44.58 to get after him.
00:15:44.58 --> 00:15:49.06 He is ready to charge and only one guy out of the whole crew is looking like he's going
00:15:49.06 --> 00:15:55.42 to hold back and they talk about reputation here and that's definitely something that
00:15:55.42 --> 00:16:00.14 is when you get to this heel teams as you're a new guy someone tells you they'll say
00:16:00.14 --> 00:16:07.14 your reputation is everything and it's totally true and it's the same in any military organization
00:16:07.14 --> 00:16:13.74 what your reputation is because in the military you think ranks all important right but
00:16:13.74 --> 00:16:18.14 the reality is there's something that completely trumps rank and that's reputation.
00:16:18.14 --> 00:16:23.38 And if you're I mean I always talk about the fact that relationships are more important
00:16:23.38 --> 00:16:27.74 than chain of command but you're not going to have a good relationship with people if you
00:16:27.74 --> 00:16:30.34 don't have a good reputation it's not happening.
00:16:30.34 --> 00:16:31.50 So make sense.
00:16:31.50 --> 00:16:36.18 Same thing back in 1803.
00:16:36.18 --> 00:16:37.18 Back to the book.
00:16:37.18 --> 00:16:43.70 Whilst in Denmark we led a tolerably active life the rifles being continually on the alert ordered
00:16:43.70 --> 00:16:51.70 heither today and counter-mandered the next occasionally also we had some pleasant adventures
00:16:51.70 --> 00:16:58.38 among the blue eyed Danish lasses for the rifles were always terrible fellows in that
00:16:58.38 --> 00:17:02.38 way.
00:17:02.38 --> 00:17:08.02 I think that doesn't need too much explanation.
00:17:08.02 --> 00:17:13.70 They I'll say this as I always say I have to fast forward through this book I'm not
00:17:13.70 --> 00:17:18.42 reading the entire book even though the entire book is awesome in this point this point
00:17:18.42 --> 00:17:27.46 here they're embarking for Portugal we have another another campaign to go on back to
00:17:27.46 --> 00:17:32.02 the book I wish I could picture the splendid sight of the shipping in the downs at the time
00:17:32.02 --> 00:17:37.74 we embarked with about 20,000 men those were times which are so which the soldiers of our
00:17:37.74 --> 00:17:41.46 own more peaceful days have little conception of.
00:17:41.46 --> 00:17:50.14 So this book was written before World War I and really this was the last big war is the
00:17:50.14 --> 00:17:54.02 wars that he went through the Napoleonic wars so he's kind of he's kind of saying you
00:17:54.02 --> 00:17:58.14 don't even know if this is like anymore you don't know what it's like.
00:17:58.14 --> 00:18:03.46 You don't know if the the the the soldiers of our own more peaceful days have little conception
00:18:03.46 --> 00:18:10.18 of what it's like to embark 20,000 troops to get ready to go get some.
00:18:10.18 --> 00:18:15.34 To the book we sailed majestically out of the cove of cork for hostile shore where we
00:18:15.34 --> 00:18:20.46 would safely arrived and disembarked at Mondego Bay.
00:18:20.46 --> 00:18:26.02 The rifles were first out of the vessels for we were indeed always in front of the
00:18:26.02 --> 00:18:32.70 advance and always in the rear in retreat like the Kentish men of old we claim the post of
00:18:32.70 --> 00:18:36.62 honor in the field I try to figure out what that.
00:18:36.62 --> 00:18:42.18 The Kentish men Kentish obviously a place and and the as far as the best I could figure
00:18:42.18 --> 00:18:48.98 out was that the people in Kent stood up hardcore against the Norman invasion and I think
00:18:48.98 --> 00:18:51.02 that's what that reference is to.
00:18:51.02 --> 00:18:55.66 I'm sure someone will correct me and I hope somebody does.
00:18:55.66 --> 00:18:59.90 Back to the book being immediately pushed forward up the country and advance the main body
00:18:59.90 --> 00:19:04.50 many of us in this hot climate very soon began to find out the misery of the frightful
00:19:04.50 --> 00:19:09.06 load we were condemned to march and fight under with a burning son above our heads and
00:19:09.06 --> 00:19:13.54 our feet sinking every step into the hot sand.
00:19:13.54 --> 00:19:18.66 The weight of the weight I myself toiled under was tremendous and I often wonder at the
00:19:18.66 --> 00:19:23.34 strength I possessed at this period that which enabled me to endure it.
00:19:23.34 --> 00:19:27.54 For indeed I'm convinced that many of our infantry sank and died under the weight of
00:19:27.54 --> 00:19:29.66 their nap sacks alone.
00:19:29.66 --> 00:19:35.94 For my own part being a handicraft, a handicraft I marched under the weight sufficient to
00:19:35.94 --> 00:19:39.98 impede the free motions of a donkey.
00:19:39.98 --> 00:19:44.82 For besides my well-filled kit there was a great coat rolled on its top my blanket and
00:19:44.82 --> 00:19:49.10 camp kettle my haversack stuffed full of leather for repairing the men's shoes together
00:19:49.10 --> 00:19:52.54 with a hammer and other tools.
00:19:52.54 --> 00:19:55.90 Ship biscuit and beef for three days.
00:19:55.90 --> 00:20:00.78 I also carried my canteen filled with water my hatchet and rifle and 80 rounds of ball
00:20:00.78 --> 00:20:03.26 cartridge in my pouch.
00:20:03.26 --> 00:20:09.30 This last except the beef and biscuit being the best thing I owned and which I always
00:20:09.30 --> 00:20:15.74 gave the enemy the benefit of when the opportunity offered.
00:20:15.74 --> 00:20:21.34 It's interesting he knew how to work on shoes and so he carries stuff to repair shoes
00:20:21.34 --> 00:20:22.34 in the field.
00:20:22.34 --> 00:20:25.66 Think about that that's just a lost art isn't it?
00:20:25.66 --> 00:20:30.50 Think about where you are in the field when you have to march 15 miles a day and you
00:20:30.50 --> 00:20:34.58 have no shoes if there's someone that can fix your shoes.
00:20:34.58 --> 00:20:37.78 That's a godsend.
00:20:37.78 --> 00:20:41.82 Back to the book the next day we again advanced and being in a state of the utmost anxiety
00:20:41.82 --> 00:20:47.06 to come up along the French neither the heat of the burning sun, long miles or heavy
00:20:47.06 --> 00:20:50.50 nap sacks were able to diminish our arguer.
00:20:50.50 --> 00:20:56.70 Indeed I often look back with wonder at the light-hearted style, the jolety and the reckless
00:20:56.70 --> 00:21:02.34 indifference with which men who were so destined and short time to fall hurried onwards
00:21:02.34 --> 00:21:07.22 toward the field of strife, seemingly without a thought of anything but the sheer love
00:21:07.22 --> 00:21:14.74 of meeting the foe and the excitement of battle.
00:21:14.74 --> 00:21:21.74 You wrote this book 20 something years after this happened after this experience.
00:21:21.74 --> 00:21:35.78 I want to say he wrote it in 1938 maybe is when it came out and you can see that so my
00:21:35.78 --> 00:21:42.06 point in saying that is that looking back he knows because he's going to go through hell.
00:21:42.06 --> 00:21:48.90 He's going to go through hardcore combat but even knowing how horrible combat is he still
00:21:48.90 --> 00:21:54.90 looks back and is amazed at how they were ready to go.
00:21:54.90 --> 00:22:00.10 Going back to the book the 29th Regiment received so terrible a fire that I saw the right
00:22:00.10 --> 00:22:04.90 wing almost annihilated and the Colonel I think his name was Lennox Lace sprawling amongst
00:22:04.90 --> 00:22:06.70 the rest.
00:22:06.70 --> 00:22:13.18 We had caught ourselves in it pretty hamptomly for there was no cover for us and we were
00:22:13.18 --> 00:22:14.82 rather too near.
00:22:14.82 --> 00:22:20.46 The living skirmishers were laying beside heaps of their own dead but still we had our
00:22:20.46 --> 00:22:24.58 own till the battalion regiments come up.
00:22:24.58 --> 00:22:31.58 Fire and retire is a very good sound but the rifles were not overfond of such notes.
00:22:31.58 --> 00:22:35.66 We never performed that maneuver except when it was made pretty plain to us that it was
00:22:35.66 --> 00:22:37.34 quite necessary.
00:22:37.34 --> 00:22:43.34 The 29th however had got their fairing hair at this time and the shock of that fire seemed
00:22:43.34 --> 00:22:46.78 to stagger the whole line and make them recoil.
00:22:46.78 --> 00:22:50.62 At the moment a little confusion appeared in the ranks I thought.
00:22:50.62 --> 00:22:55.90 Lord Hill was near at hand and saw it and I observed him come galloping up.
00:22:55.90 --> 00:22:59.82 He put himself at the head of the regimen and restored them to order in a moment there's
00:22:59.82 --> 00:23:02.06 some leadership just full on leadership and action.
00:23:02.06 --> 00:23:06.66 So there's also fire and retire what that means is cover move.
00:23:06.66 --> 00:23:10.66 So you have some people shooting and some people falling back that's how they retreat
00:23:10.66 --> 00:23:13.38 and they use that whenever they have to retreat you'll hear that.
00:23:13.38 --> 00:23:17.74 I don't know if I did this made this clear enough but it's a bugle.
00:23:17.74 --> 00:23:23.50 It's a bugle signal so the bugle would play some certain number of notes or some pattern
00:23:23.50 --> 00:23:27.38 of notes and everyone would know that means fire and retire.
00:23:27.38 --> 00:23:36.82 Now we get that broad that broad plan out to everyone at once which is instead of advancing
00:23:36.82 --> 00:23:41.70 which is what we were doing now we're going to retreat and as soon as you get everyone
00:23:41.70 --> 00:23:44.90 that information now little elements can start to make it happen that's decentralized
00:23:44.90 --> 00:23:48.58 command but you have to have good communications in order for that to work and what you
00:23:48.58 --> 00:23:52.98 need to communicate is the broad plan and that's what they get done with a nice little
00:23:52.98 --> 00:23:59.86 bugle signal back to the book pouring a regular sharp fire upon the enemy he gulred
00:23:59.86 --> 00:24:05.14 them in return and remaining with the 29th until he brought them to the charge quickly
00:24:05.14 --> 00:24:09.14 sent the foe in the right about.
00:24:09.14 --> 00:24:13.34 It seemed to me that few men could have conducted the business with more coolness and
00:24:13.34 --> 00:24:19.42 quietude of manner under such a storm of balls as he was exposed to.
00:24:19.42 --> 00:24:22.94 Indeed I have never forgotten him from that day.
00:24:22.94 --> 00:24:28.26 So it's important to also recognize that you have a group of men that are about to fall
00:24:28.26 --> 00:24:36.06 apart and there's confusion and one guy I talk about this all the time one guy steps up
00:24:36.06 --> 00:24:40.62 takes ownership of the situation leads and it changes the entire outcome of the battle.
00:24:40.62 --> 00:24:45.86 Think about that one person you got thousand men versus a thousand men one person makes
00:24:45.86 --> 00:24:46.86 the difference.
00:24:46.86 --> 00:24:49.54 So if you're in a leadership position think about that think about what you're doing.
00:24:49.54 --> 00:24:51.02 Are you leading?
00:24:51.02 --> 00:24:52.26 Are you stepping up?
00:24:52.26 --> 00:24:55.78 Are you galloping up on a horse and setting things right?
00:24:55.78 --> 00:24:56.78 Hmm.
00:24:56.78 --> 00:24:59.98 Collector, do you need to be doing it?
00:24:59.98 --> 00:25:04.54 Back to the book, at the time I was remarking these matters loading and firing as I lay.
00:25:04.54 --> 00:25:08.46 Another circumstance divided my attention for a while and made me forget even the
00:25:08.46 --> 00:25:11.42 gallant conduct of general hill.
00:25:11.42 --> 00:25:16.94 A man near me uttered a scream of agony and looking from the 29th who were on my right to
00:25:16.94 --> 00:25:19.34 the left once the screech had come.
00:25:19.34 --> 00:25:24.14 I saw one of our sergeants named Frazier sitting in a doubled up position and swaying
00:25:24.14 --> 00:25:30.22 backwards and forwards as though he had got a terrible pain in his bowels.
00:25:30.22 --> 00:25:36.06 He continued to make such complaint that I arose and went to him for he was rather a
00:25:36.06 --> 00:25:37.62 crony of mine.
00:25:37.62 --> 00:25:41.34 Oh, Harris said he as I took him in my arms.
00:25:41.34 --> 00:25:42.18 I shall die.
00:25:42.18 --> 00:25:43.34 I shall die.
00:25:43.34 --> 00:25:46.86 The agony is so great that I cannot bear it.
00:25:46.86 --> 00:25:50.18 It was indeed dreadful to look upon him.
00:25:50.18 --> 00:25:55.74 The froth came from his mouth and the perspiration poured from his face.
00:25:55.74 --> 00:25:57.86 Think heaven.
00:25:57.86 --> 00:26:04.74 He was soon out of pain and laying him down I returned to my place.
00:26:04.74 --> 00:26:08.90 Poor fellow, he suffered more for a short time that he was dying than any man I think
00:26:08.90 --> 00:26:12.30 I ever saw in the same circumstances.
00:26:12.30 --> 00:26:16.94 I had the courtesy to return and look at him after the battle.
00:26:16.94 --> 00:26:24.54 The musket ball I found had taken him sideways and gone through both groins.
00:26:24.54 --> 00:26:31.74 Within about a half an hour after this, I left sergeant Frazier and indeed for the time
00:26:31.74 --> 00:26:37.50 had as completely forgotten him as if he had died a hundred years back.
00:26:37.50 --> 00:26:42.94 The sight of so much bloodshed around will not suffer the mind to dwell long in any particular
00:26:42.94 --> 00:26:44.62 casualty.
00:26:44.62 --> 00:26:49.10 Even though it happened to one's dearest friends.
00:26:49.10 --> 00:26:55.50 There was no time either to think for all was action with us rifles just at this moment.
00:26:55.50 --> 00:26:59.98 And the barrel of my piece was so hot from continual firing that I could hardly bear to
00:26:59.98 --> 00:27:01.34 touch it.
00:27:01.34 --> 00:27:13.02 It was obliged to grasp the stock beneath the iron as I continued to blaze away.
00:27:13.02 --> 00:27:18.34 Doesn't even have time to think about it.
00:27:18.34 --> 00:27:22.70 James Panton was another crony of mine, a gallant fellow.
00:27:22.70 --> 00:27:27.06 He had pushed himself in front of me and was checked by one of our officers, rat for
00:27:27.06 --> 00:27:28.26 his rashness.
00:27:28.26 --> 00:27:31.38 He'd be back you, Panton.
00:27:31.38 --> 00:27:35.82 The lieutenant said to him more than once, but Panton was to be restrained.
00:27:35.82 --> 00:27:41.30 But Panton was not to be restrained by anything but a bullet went in action.
00:27:41.30 --> 00:27:47.38 This time he got one, which striking him in the thigh I suppose hit an artery for he died
00:27:47.38 --> 00:27:49.38 quickly.
00:27:49.38 --> 00:27:54.26 The Frenchman's balls were flying very wickedly at that moment and I crept up to Panton
00:27:54.26 --> 00:28:00.94 and took shelter by lying behind and making a rest for my rifle of his dead body.
00:28:00.94 --> 00:28:06.78 It strikes me that I revenge his death by the assistance of his carcass.
00:28:06.78 --> 00:28:10.66 At any rate I tried my best to hit his enemies hard.
00:28:10.66 --> 00:28:14.94 There were two small buildings to our front and the French having managed to get into
00:28:14.94 --> 00:28:17.98 them annoyed as much from that quarter.
00:28:17.98 --> 00:28:23.34 A small rise in the ground closed before these houses also favored them.
00:28:23.34 --> 00:28:27.82 And our men were being handled very severely in consequence.
00:28:27.82 --> 00:28:31.42 They became angry and wouldn't stand it any longer.
00:28:31.42 --> 00:28:37.74 One of the skirmishers jumping off, rushed forward, crying over boys over over.
00:28:37.74 --> 00:28:43.94 When he instantly went instantly, the whole line responded to the cry over over over
00:28:43.94 --> 00:28:48.86 they ran along the grass like wildfire, then dashed at the rise, fixing their sword
00:28:48.86 --> 00:28:51.18 bayonets as they ran.
00:28:51.18 --> 00:28:57.02 The French light bobs could not stand the sight but turned about and fled and getting
00:28:57.02 --> 00:29:01.98 possession of their ground we were soon inside the buildings.
00:29:01.98 --> 00:29:04.78 After the battle was over I stepped across the other house.
00:29:04.78 --> 00:29:08.30 I have mentioned in order to see what was going on there.
00:29:08.30 --> 00:29:12.82 For the one I remained in was now pretty well filled with the wounded, both French and
00:29:12.82 --> 00:29:17.22 English who had managed to get there for a little shelter.
00:29:17.22 --> 00:29:22.54 Two or three surgeons also had arrived at this house and were busy engaged in giving
00:29:22.54 --> 00:29:24.54 their assistance to the wounded.
00:29:24.54 --> 00:29:28.82 Now also here lying as thickly as in the building which I had left.
00:29:28.82 --> 00:29:31.38 But what struck me the most.
00:29:31.38 --> 00:29:36.78 But what struck me the most forcibly was that from the circumstance of some wine butts having
00:29:36.78 --> 00:29:41.46 been left in the apartment and having their engagement been perforated, having in the
00:29:41.46 --> 00:29:46.42 engagement been perforated by bullets and otherwise broken, the red wine had escaped most
00:29:46.42 --> 00:29:51.62 plentifully and ran down upon the earth and floor where the wounded were lying so that
00:29:51.62 --> 00:30:01.58 many of them were soaked in the wine with which their blood was minkled.
00:30:01.58 --> 00:30:10.90 I hate to even think about the medical care that these guys are getting and the medical
00:30:10.90 --> 00:30:16.34 care that we had in Iraq was unbelievable.
00:30:16.34 --> 00:30:23.18 Not only from the speed that you would get assistance but also the quality of care that
00:30:23.18 --> 00:30:30.50 you would get on in the field from our own medics and how quickly they would get you
00:30:30.50 --> 00:30:36.58 and then get you take care of and then get you evacuated to a full medical facility.
00:30:36.58 --> 00:30:40.02 And that actually changed during my time in the teams.
00:30:40.02 --> 00:30:41.90 For instance the biggest change.
00:30:41.90 --> 00:30:49.10 When I first got in the teams what we were taught was if someone got shot you immediately
00:30:49.10 --> 00:30:55.26 give them an IV meaning a bag of fluid because they're bleeding you got to replace that.
00:30:55.26 --> 00:31:03.06 And now they don't do that automatically because your body has its own mechanisms when
00:31:03.06 --> 00:31:05.50 it loses blood to stop the bleeding.
00:31:05.50 --> 00:31:12.50 It pulls back in the arteries and veins and it constricts them and it cloths the blood that's
00:31:12.50 --> 00:31:17.74 there and so when you give someone an IV the body thinks I don't need to do that so it
00:31:17.74 --> 00:31:21.10 opens up the arteries and opens up the veins it doesn't constrict anything it doesn't
00:31:21.10 --> 00:31:23.06 get cloths slower.
00:31:23.06 --> 00:31:28.38 So there's like one example and that's during my time so that's the last 25 years
00:31:28.38 --> 00:31:30.26 that that changed to stay in place.
00:31:30.26 --> 00:31:37.74 So now you go back you know a hundred and two hundred years it's totally different and
00:31:37.74 --> 00:31:39.50 they'll talk more about that.
00:31:39.50 --> 00:31:45.98 The basic the basic plan was if you get shot in a limb you're losing the limb that's
00:31:45.98 --> 00:31:51.02 basically what's going on just amputations.
00:31:51.02 --> 00:31:58.34 And nowadays they do an incredible job of saving limbs if they can be saved they save
00:31:58.34 --> 00:32:01.62 them I mean they do an incredible job.
00:32:01.62 --> 00:32:06.18 All right back to the book it was on the 15th of August when we first came up with
00:32:06.18 --> 00:32:12.62 the French and their skirmishers immediately commenced operations by raining a shower
00:32:12.62 --> 00:32:18.18 of balls upon us as we advanced which we returned without delay and I haven't said
00:32:18.18 --> 00:32:21.14 this yet but the reason they're saying balls and said around is because these guys are
00:32:21.14 --> 00:32:26.66 shooting balls with you round balls of lead and at this point there was some rifling
00:32:26.66 --> 00:32:32.50 head started to come about but what they basically just consider everything to be a ball
00:32:32.50 --> 00:32:36.50 of lead and that's why they're not accurate that's why they're only accurate out to 200
00:32:36.50 --> 00:32:41.38 meters because they're not rifled like we have the tight rifling spinning bullets
00:32:41.38 --> 00:32:43.90 today.
00:32:43.90 --> 00:32:48.50 Back to the book the first man that was hit was Lieutenant Bunbury.
00:32:48.50 --> 00:32:54.54 He fell pierced through the head with a musket ball and died almost immediately.
00:32:54.54 --> 00:32:58.94 I thought I never heard such a tremendous noise as the firing made on the occasion and
00:32:58.94 --> 00:33:06.50 the men on both sides of me I would could occasionally observe we're falling fast.
00:33:06.50 --> 00:33:11.62 I do not pretend to give a description of this or any other battle I have been present
00:33:11.62 --> 00:33:12.90 at.
00:33:12.90 --> 00:33:17.74 All I can do is tell the things which happened immediately around me and that I think is as
00:33:17.74 --> 00:33:22.02 much as a private soldier can be expected to do.
00:33:22.02 --> 00:33:26.50 Soon afterwards the firing commenced and we had to take we had advanced pretty close
00:33:26.50 --> 00:33:28.02 upon the enemy.
00:33:28.02 --> 00:33:32.98 Taking advantage of whatever cover I could find I threw myself behind a small bank where
00:33:32.98 --> 00:33:38.42 I lay so secure that although the Frenchman's bullets fell pretty thickly around I was
00:33:38.42 --> 00:33:42.42 enabled to knock several over without being dislodged.
00:33:42.42 --> 00:33:49.58 In fact I fired away every round I had in my pouch while slaying in this spot.
00:33:49.58 --> 00:33:55.70 At length after a sharp contest we forced them to give ground and following them up drove
00:33:55.70 --> 00:34:00.46 them from their position in the heights and hung up their skirts until they made another
00:34:00.46 --> 00:34:04.94 stand and then the game began again.
00:34:04.94 --> 00:34:10.38 The rifles indeed fought well this day and we lost many men.
00:34:10.38 --> 00:34:16.14 They seemed in high spirits and delighted at having driven the enemy before them.
00:34:16.14 --> 00:34:21.94 The most impressive coach was by my side loading and firing very industriously about this
00:34:21.94 --> 00:34:24.18 period of the day.
00:34:24.18 --> 00:34:29.10 Firsting with heat and action he lifted his canteen to his mouth, here's to you old boy.
00:34:29.10 --> 00:34:32.54 He said as he took a poll at its contents.
00:34:32.54 --> 00:34:38.26 As he did so a bullet went through the canteen and perforated his brain killing him in
00:34:38.26 --> 00:34:39.90 a moment.
00:34:39.90 --> 00:34:47.58 Another man fell close to him almost immediately struck by a ball in the thigh.
00:34:47.58 --> 00:34:54.10 I saw a man named Simon struck full in the face by a round shot and he came to the ground
00:34:54.10 --> 00:35:00.90 a headless trunk.
00:35:00.90 --> 00:35:05.74 When the role was called after the battle the females who missed their husbands came along
00:35:05.74 --> 00:35:13.46 the front of the line to inquire of the survivors whether they knew anything about them.
00:35:13.46 --> 00:35:19.46 The wives could travel with the soldiers and again it just seems crazy to me right now but
00:35:19.46 --> 00:35:22.38 that's the way they did it.
00:35:22.38 --> 00:35:27.70 Not all of them but if they made that decision I guess as a family to stick together they
00:35:27.70 --> 00:35:35.18 would get right on board the boats and they'd march in the book they didn't want
00:35:35.18 --> 00:35:40.82 to carry the weight but they'd march alongside and go from place to place and when the
00:35:40.82 --> 00:35:44.66 battles about to take place they'd hang back and then you have the situation once the
00:35:44.66 --> 00:35:47.02 battles over that I'm talking about right now.
00:35:47.02 --> 00:35:52.34 Amongst other names I heard that of Coach Ann called in a female voice without being
00:35:52.34 --> 00:35:54.26 replied to.
00:35:54.26 --> 00:35:58.82 The name struck me and I observed the poor woman who had called it as she said stopping
00:35:58.82 --> 00:36:04.58 sobbing before us and apparently afraid to make further inquiries about her husband.
00:36:04.58 --> 00:36:10.62 Oh man had answered to his name or had any given account to give of his fate.
00:36:10.62 --> 00:36:16.90 I myself had observed him fall as related before while drinking from his canteen but as
00:36:16.90 --> 00:36:23.58 I looked at the poor sobbing creature before me I felt unable to tell her of his death.
00:36:23.58 --> 00:36:28.98 That length capped in leech observed her and called out to the company does any man know
00:36:28.98 --> 00:36:30.70 what has happened to Coach Ann.
00:36:30.70 --> 00:36:37.06 If so let him speak out at once upon this order I immediately related what I had seen and
00:36:37.06 --> 00:36:39.50 told the man of his death.
00:36:39.50 --> 00:36:44.34 After a while this coat misses Coach Ann appeared anxious to seek the spot where husband
00:36:44.34 --> 00:36:50.18 fell and in the hope of still finding him alive asked me to accompany her over the field.
00:36:50.18 --> 00:36:56.18 She trusted notwithstanding what I had told her to find him yet alive.
00:36:56.18 --> 00:37:01.94 Do you think you could find it said captain leech upon being referred to?
00:37:01.94 --> 00:37:07.06 I told him I was sure I could as I had remarked many objects whilst looking for cover
00:37:07.06 --> 00:37:08.62 during the skirmishing.
00:37:08.62 --> 00:37:13.46 Go then said the captain and show the poor woman the spot as she seemed so desireless
00:37:13.46 --> 00:37:16.18 of finding the body.
00:37:16.18 --> 00:37:20.82 I accordingly took my way over the ground we had fought upon she following and sobbing
00:37:20.82 --> 00:37:27.78 after me quickly reaching the spot where her husband's body lay pointed out to her.
00:37:27.78 --> 00:37:32.78 She now discovered soon all her hopes were in vain.
00:37:32.78 --> 00:37:38.90 She embraced a stiffened corpse and after rising and contemplating his disfigured face
00:37:38.90 --> 00:37:44.86 for some minutes with hands clasped and tears streaming down her cheeks she took a prayer
00:37:44.86 --> 00:37:53.22 book from her pocket and kneeling down repeated the service for the dead over the body.
00:37:53.22 --> 00:37:55.22 Poor woman.
00:37:55.22 --> 00:38:05.46 I pity her much but there was no remedy.
00:38:05.46 --> 00:38:17.42 I told her I was a little bit more nervous than I thought.
00:38:17.42 --> 00:38:23.90 The French came down upon us as a column and the rifleman immediately commenced
00:38:23.90 --> 00:38:27.98 to sharp fire upon them from whatever cover they could get a shelter behind whilst
00:38:27.98 --> 00:38:31.22 our cannon played upon them from our rear.
00:38:31.22 --> 00:38:36.62 I saw regular lanes torn through their ranks as they advanced which were immediately
00:38:36.62 --> 00:38:40.50 closed up again as they marched steadily on.
00:38:40.50 --> 00:38:46.86 Whenever we saw round shot, thus go through the mass we raised a shout of delight.
00:38:46.86 --> 00:38:52.18 That's a savage image right there ranks of men and there's cannon balls that are cutting
00:38:52.18 --> 00:38:56.10 lines through cutting lanes through them.
00:38:56.10 --> 00:39:02.94 You probably talking 20, 30 people killed each one and the ranks just closing around them.
00:39:02.94 --> 00:39:07.30 That's what these guys are seeing as this advanced takes place.
00:39:07.30 --> 00:39:09.82 They're continue through that battle.
00:39:09.82 --> 00:39:12.66 They get into a position for another battle.
00:39:12.66 --> 00:39:17.26 Going back to the book as I looked about me while standing and ranked and just thought
00:39:17.26 --> 00:39:22.14 and just before the commencement of the battle, I thought it the most imposing sight
00:39:22.14 --> 00:39:24.90 the world could produce.
00:39:24.90 --> 00:39:29.78 Our lines glittering with bright arms, the stern features of the men as they stood with
00:39:29.78 --> 00:39:35.34 their eyes fixed on alterably upon the enemy, the proud colors of England floating over
00:39:35.34 --> 00:39:41.22 the heads of the different battalions and the dark cannon on the rising ground and all
00:39:41.22 --> 00:39:47.26 in readiness to commence the awful work of death with a noise that would defen the whole
00:39:47.26 --> 00:39:49.86 multitude.
00:39:49.86 --> 00:39:55.26 Although the sight had a singular and terrible effect upon the feelings of a youth who,
00:39:55.26 --> 00:40:01.82 a few short months before, had been a solitary shepherd upon the downs of door-sature
00:40:01.82 --> 00:40:07.86 and had never contemplated any other sort of life than the peaceful occupation of watching
00:40:07.86 --> 00:40:13.82 the innocent sheep as they fed upon the grassy turf.
00:40:13.82 --> 00:40:15.18 Talk about a dichotomy.
00:40:15.18 --> 00:40:22.18 Yeah. No fought in his mind other than watching sheep eat grass.
00:40:22.18 --> 00:40:28.90 I would think that that would be kind of a good little escape, you know, from time to time
00:40:28.90 --> 00:40:31.50 to notice those types of things.
00:40:31.50 --> 00:40:38.94 Yes, I think you're right and I think that happens and there's a movie called the Finn Redline
00:40:38.94 --> 00:40:41.46 and that's portrayed very well.
00:40:41.46 --> 00:40:46.70 And all this chaos, he'll take cover and he'll be face to face with a flower or he'll
00:40:46.70 --> 00:40:51.82 notice a bird or a bug and that's definitely something that people notice.
00:40:51.82 --> 00:40:56.42 I mean, I noticed there's this sunset no matter where you are in the world and actually
00:40:56.42 --> 00:41:01.18 there's sunset in the desert, it's a very beautiful thing and same with the sunrise.
00:41:01.18 --> 00:41:05.94 And so those are little things that you notice even though you might not be in the mindset
00:41:05.94 --> 00:41:11.42 to notice them, you still notice them.
00:41:11.42 --> 00:41:16.86 Back to the book, the battle commencing immediately, we were all soon hard at work.
00:41:16.86 --> 00:41:19.82 The rifles as usual were pretty busy in this battle.
00:41:19.82 --> 00:41:24.90 The French and Great Numbers came steadily down upon us and we peltered away upon them
00:41:24.90 --> 00:41:27.90 like a shower of lead and hail.
00:41:27.90 --> 00:41:32.74 Under any cover we could find and lay, firing one moment jumping up and running for at
00:41:32.74 --> 00:41:34.06 the next.
00:41:34.06 --> 00:41:38.46 And when we could see before us, we observed the cannonballs making a lane through the
00:41:38.46 --> 00:41:48.66 enemy's columns as they advanced as they were, hosying and shouting like madmen.
00:41:48.66 --> 00:41:54.90 The battle soon became general, the smoke thickened around and often I was obliged to stop
00:41:54.90 --> 00:41:59.34 firing and dash it aside from my face and try and vain to get a sight of what was going
00:41:59.34 --> 00:42:05.02 on whilst groans and shouts and an oys of cannon and muscatory appeared almost to shake
00:42:05.02 --> 00:42:07.66 the very ground.
00:42:07.66 --> 00:42:10.94 It seemed hell upon or if I thought.
00:42:10.94 --> 00:42:16.86 A man named John Low stood before me at this moment and he turned round during a pause
00:42:16.86 --> 00:42:20.74 in our exertions, then he addressed me, Harris, you humbug?
00:42:20.74 --> 00:42:24.78 He said, you've got plenty of money about you, I know, for you don't always staying
00:42:24.78 --> 00:42:27.74 about and picking up what you can find on the field.
00:42:27.74 --> 00:42:30.78 But I think this will be your last field, Dale, boy.
00:42:30.78 --> 00:42:34.50 A good many of us will catch it, I suspect today.
00:42:34.50 --> 00:42:40.30 The right low I said, I've got nine guinea's in my pack and if I am shot today and you
00:42:40.30 --> 00:42:47.90 escape yourself, it's quite at your service in the meantime, however, if you see any symptoms
00:42:47.90 --> 00:42:55.78 of my wishing to flinch in this business, I hope you will shoot me with your own hand.
00:42:55.78 --> 00:42:56.78 Low.
00:42:56.78 --> 00:42:58.62 So let's think about that.
00:42:58.62 --> 00:43:00.02 That's pretty awesome.
00:43:00.02 --> 00:43:04.78 Well, the attitude of they're basically talking smack to each other.
00:43:04.78 --> 00:43:05.78 Classic.
00:43:05.78 --> 00:43:06.78 Hey, I don't think you're going to make it.
00:43:06.78 --> 00:43:10.10 I know you got a lot of money on you and if you don't make it, what do you say?
00:43:10.10 --> 00:43:11.10 Is that mine?
00:43:11.10 --> 00:43:13.26 Yes, if I die, come and get it.
00:43:13.26 --> 00:43:14.62 I got nine guinea's in my pack.
00:43:14.62 --> 00:43:16.10 They're all yours.
00:43:16.10 --> 00:43:17.54 And then this is classic.
00:43:17.54 --> 00:43:23.14 By the way, if you see me acting cowardly in any way, you better shoot me.
00:43:23.14 --> 00:43:26.14 Yeah, it's legit.
00:43:26.14 --> 00:43:28.62 Low as well as myself survived this battle.
00:43:28.62 --> 00:43:34.14 And after it was over, whilst we sat down with our comrades and rested amongst other matters,
00:43:34.14 --> 00:43:38.66 talked over, low told them of our conversation during the heat of the day, and the money
00:43:38.66 --> 00:43:43.66 I'd collected, and the rifles from that time to time had a great respect for me.
00:43:43.66 --> 00:43:50.14 It is indeed singular how a man loses or gains cast with his comrades from the behavior
00:43:50.14 --> 00:43:53.26 and how closely he is observed on the battlefield.
00:43:53.26 --> 00:43:57.98 Again, talking about reputation once again.
00:43:57.98 --> 00:44:03.42 The officers too are commented upon and closely observed.
00:44:03.42 --> 00:44:05.70 Everyone's watching the officers.
00:44:05.70 --> 00:44:10.30 The men are very proud of those who are brave in the field and kind in consider it
00:44:10.30 --> 00:44:14.30 to the soldiers and under them.
00:44:14.30 --> 00:44:20.66 An act of kindness done by an officer has often during battle been the cause of his life
00:44:20.66 --> 00:44:22.26 being saved.
00:44:22.26 --> 00:44:25.02 Got a little relationship going.
00:44:25.02 --> 00:44:31.74 Nay, whatever folks may say upon the matter, I know from experience that in our army,
00:44:31.74 --> 00:44:38.26 the men like best be officer by gentleman, men whose education is rendered them more kind
00:44:38.26 --> 00:44:44.74 in manners than your course officer sprung from obscure origin and whose style is brutal
00:44:44.74 --> 00:44:46.78 and overbearing.
00:44:46.78 --> 00:44:52.66 So as I was reading through that, at first I kind of got a little bit taken a back
00:44:52.66 --> 00:44:56.94 and said, what are you trying to say if you have a men of college or that's what you need,
00:44:56.94 --> 00:44:59.42 you need to be from this good upbringing.
00:44:59.42 --> 00:45:02.42 But that might be what he's saying at that time.
00:45:02.42 --> 00:45:05.94 But the important part is it's how you treat people.
00:45:05.94 --> 00:45:08.06 Doesn't matter what background you came from.
00:45:08.06 --> 00:45:13.26 He says, men whose education is rendered them more kind in manners and rather than someone
00:45:13.26 --> 00:45:15.86 that's from an obscure origin.
00:45:15.86 --> 00:45:19.46 What I'm telling you is it doesn't matter where you're from and he would agree with this
00:45:19.46 --> 00:45:21.78 now if he was here to talk with me.
00:45:21.78 --> 00:45:22.78 Of course.
00:45:22.78 --> 00:45:24.38 But it's not.
00:45:24.38 --> 00:45:30.38 He's talking about the the men like to work for officers that aren't brutal and overbearing.
00:45:30.38 --> 00:45:32.02 No one likes that.
00:45:32.02 --> 00:45:35.14 And you don't perform well.
00:45:35.14 --> 00:45:38.90 You want to build the relationship with your troops, the kindness done by an officer
00:45:38.90 --> 00:45:42.46 is often during the battle, been the cause of his life being saved.
00:45:42.46 --> 00:45:49.10 That means guys are trying to win.
00:45:49.10 --> 00:45:55.42 Back to the book and let me bear testimony to the courage and endurance of that army
00:45:55.42 --> 00:46:02.14 under trials and hardships, such as few armies in any age I should think endured.
00:46:02.14 --> 00:46:07.34 I've seen officers and men hobbling forward with tears in their eyes from the misery
00:46:07.34 --> 00:46:13.42 of long miles, empty stomachs and ragged backs without even shoes or stockings on their
00:46:13.42 --> 00:46:15.66 bleeding feet.
00:46:15.66 --> 00:46:19.94 And it was not a little thing that would bring a tear into the eyes of a riflemen of the
00:46:19.94 --> 00:46:22.54 peninsula wars.
00:46:22.54 --> 00:46:29.10 Yuts, who had not long been removed from their parents home and care, officers and men
00:46:29.10 --> 00:46:36.70 have borne hardships and privations such as in our more peaceful days, we have little conception
00:46:36.70 --> 00:46:38.58 of.
00:46:38.58 --> 00:46:45.02 And yet these men, faint and weary with toil, would brighten up in a moment when the
00:46:45.02 --> 00:46:51.26 war granted amongst us that the enemy were at hand.
00:46:51.26 --> 00:47:02.38 Once again he's ragging on you have really been to war lately, peaceful days and brutal
00:47:02.38 --> 00:47:06.98 privations that these guys go through and yet they're still ready to step up.
00:47:06.98 --> 00:47:09.38 Back to the book it was just at the close of the battle.
00:47:09.38 --> 00:47:13.86 The dreadful turmoil and noise of the engagement had hardly subsided and I began to look
00:47:13.86 --> 00:47:19.70 at the faces of the men close around me to see who had escaped the dangers of the hour.
00:47:19.70 --> 00:47:22.62 I saw that the ranks of the riflemen looked very thin.
00:47:22.62 --> 00:47:27.86 It seemed to me that one half had gone down.
00:47:27.86 --> 00:47:33.22 We had four companies with a 95th and were commanded that day by major traverse.
00:47:33.22 --> 00:47:37.90 He was a man much liked by the men of the rifles and indeed deservedly beloved by all
00:47:37.90 --> 00:47:39.86 who knew him.
00:47:39.86 --> 00:47:46.86 He was a tight hand but a soldier likes that better than a slavinly officer.
00:47:46.86 --> 00:47:49.86 Pay attention to that one.
00:47:49.86 --> 00:47:53.70 Don't be a slavinly leader.
00:47:53.70 --> 00:47:55.94 The troops prefer the tight hand.
00:47:55.94 --> 00:47:59.66 Back to the book I had observed him more than once during this day spurring here and there
00:47:59.66 --> 00:48:03.62 keeping the men well up and apparently in the highest spirits.
00:48:03.62 --> 00:48:07.06 He could not have enjoyed himself more I am sure.
00:48:07.06 --> 00:48:11.70 If he had been at a horse race or following a good pack of hounds.
00:48:11.70 --> 00:48:12.98 The battle was just over.
00:48:12.98 --> 00:48:16.78 A flag of troops came over from the French.
00:48:16.78 --> 00:48:20.38 We threw ourselves down where we were standing when the fire ceased.
00:48:20.38 --> 00:48:22.26 A Frenchman lay close beside me.
00:48:22.26 --> 00:48:26.54 He was dying and called to me for water which I understood him to require more from his
00:48:26.54 --> 00:48:29.86 manner than his words.
00:48:29.86 --> 00:48:33.58 I need not say that I got up and gave it to him.
00:48:33.58 --> 00:48:38.42 Whilst I did so, down galloped the major in front, just in the same good spirits he'd
00:48:38.42 --> 00:48:44.30 been in all day, plugging along, avoiding with some little difficulty, the dead and dying
00:48:44.30 --> 00:48:47.02 which were strewn about.
00:48:47.02 --> 00:48:53.18 He was never a very good-looking man being hard-featured and thin, a hatchet faced man as we
00:48:53.18 --> 00:48:55.50 used to say.
00:48:55.50 --> 00:48:59.66 But he was a regular good and a real English soldier.
00:48:59.66 --> 00:49:06.66 And that's better than if he had been the handsomeest ladies man in the army.
00:49:06.66 --> 00:49:08.66 Legit.
00:49:08.66 --> 00:49:13.58 Totally legit.
00:49:13.58 --> 00:49:16.94 Back to the book, a French soldier was lying beside me at this time.
00:49:16.94 --> 00:49:21.74 He was badly wounded and hearing him moan as he lay after I had done looking at the cavalry.
00:49:21.74 --> 00:49:24.66 I turned my attention to him and getting up.
00:49:24.66 --> 00:49:27.46 Lifted his head and poured some water into his mouth.
00:49:27.46 --> 00:49:31.66 He was dying fast, but he thanked me in a foreign language, which although I did not exactly
00:49:31.66 --> 00:49:35.58 understand, I could easily make out by the lucky gave me.
00:49:35.58 --> 00:49:42.42 Mullins of the rifles, who stepped up whilst I supported his head, damned me for a fool
00:49:42.42 --> 00:49:43.90 for my pains.
00:49:43.90 --> 00:49:49.94 Better knock out his brains, Harris, he said, he's done us, mischief, enough.
00:49:49.94 --> 00:49:54.38 I'll be bound for it today.
00:49:54.38 --> 00:50:00.82 The rifleman Harris is still a pretty sympathetic dude.
00:50:00.82 --> 00:50:04.94 Back to the book, towards evening I posted upon a rising ground amongst a clump of tall
00:50:04.94 --> 00:50:06.26 trees.
00:50:06.26 --> 00:50:10.10 There seemed to have been a sharp skirmish here as three Frenchmen were lying dead amongst
00:50:10.10 --> 00:50:12.94 the long grass upon the spot where I was standing.
00:50:12.94 --> 00:50:17.66 As I threw my rifle to my shoulder and walked past them on my beat, I observed they had
00:50:17.66 --> 00:50:22.62 been plundered and their haversax having been torn off some of the contents were scattered
00:50:22.62 --> 00:50:25.62 about.
00:50:25.62 --> 00:50:31.74 War is a sad blunter of the feelings I have often thought since those days.
00:50:31.74 --> 00:50:38.10 The contemplation of three ghastly bodies in this lonely spot failed then in making the slightest
00:50:38.10 --> 00:50:40.50 impression upon me.
00:50:40.50 --> 00:50:49.22 The sight had become even in the short time I had been engaged in the trade, but two familiar.
00:50:49.22 --> 00:50:57.74 And now there another truce kind of happens and he's observing the scene in this church
00:50:57.74 --> 00:50:58.98 yard.
00:50:58.98 --> 00:51:01.34 The scene in this church yard was somewhat singular.
00:51:01.34 --> 00:51:05.90 Two long tables had been procured from some houses near and were placed end to end amongst
00:51:05.90 --> 00:51:12.02 the graves and upon them were laid the men whose limbs it was found necessary to amputate.
00:51:12.02 --> 00:51:17.46 Both French and English were constantly lifted on and off these tables.
00:51:17.46 --> 00:51:22.66 As soon as the operation was performed upon one lot they were carried off and in those
00:51:22.66 --> 00:51:25.78 waiting behind were hoisted up.
00:51:25.78 --> 00:51:30.86 The surgeons with their sleeves turned up and their hands and arms covered in blood looking
00:51:30.86 --> 00:51:34.70 like butchers in the shambles.
00:51:34.70 --> 00:51:40.18 I saw as I passed at least 20 legs lying on the ground, many of them being clothed in the
00:51:40.18 --> 00:51:44.70 long black gators then worn by the infantry line.
00:51:44.70 --> 00:51:49.26 The surgeons had plenty of work on hand that day and not having the time to take the
00:51:49.26 --> 00:51:50.94 clothes off the wounded.
00:51:50.94 --> 00:51:55.86 They merely ripped the seams and turned the cloth back, proceeding with the operation as fast
00:51:55.86 --> 00:51:58.82 as they could.
00:51:58.82 --> 00:52:03.82 Many of the wounded came straggling into this church yard and search of assistance by themselves.
00:52:03.82 --> 00:52:10.18 I saw one man faint with loss of blood staggering along and turned to a system.
00:52:10.18 --> 00:52:15.34 He was severely wounded in the head, his face being completely encrusted with blood which
00:52:15.34 --> 00:52:19.42 had flowing during the night now dried.
00:52:19.42 --> 00:52:24.90 One eyeball was knocked out of the socket and hung down upon his cheek.
00:52:24.90 --> 00:52:30.70 Another man I observed who had been brought in and propped up against a grave mound.
00:52:30.70 --> 00:52:32.74 He seemed very badly hurt.
00:52:32.74 --> 00:52:37.26 The men who had carried him into the church yard had placed his cap filled with the fragments
00:52:37.26 --> 00:52:42.50 of biscuit close beside his head and he lay and occasionally turned his mouth towards
00:52:42.50 --> 00:52:47.26 it, got a hold of a piece of biscuit and munched it.
00:52:47.26 --> 00:52:51.86 As I was about to leave the church yard, Dr. Ridgeway, one of the surgeons called me back
00:52:51.86 --> 00:52:57.70 to assist with holding a man he was endeavouring to operate upon.
00:52:57.70 --> 00:53:01.90 Come and help me with this man, he said, where I shall be all day cutting a ball out of his
00:53:01.90 --> 00:53:04.18 shoulder.
00:53:04.18 --> 00:53:07.30 The patient's name was Douder, an Irishman.
00:53:07.30 --> 00:53:12.18 He disliked the doctor's efforts and arrived and twisted so much during the operation
00:53:12.18 --> 00:53:16.66 that it was with difficulty Dr. Ridgeway could perform it.
00:53:16.66 --> 00:53:21.94 He found a necessary to cut very deep and Douder made a terrible outcry at every fresh
00:53:21.94 --> 00:53:22.94 incision.
00:53:22.94 --> 00:53:28.26 Oh, Dr. Deer, doctor, he said, it's murdering me you are.
00:53:28.26 --> 00:53:32.70 Blood and hounds, I shall die, I shall die for the love of the Lord, don't cut me all
00:53:32.70 --> 00:53:36.02 the pieces.
00:53:36.02 --> 00:53:39.10 Douder was not altogether wrong.
00:53:39.10 --> 00:53:46.38 For although he survived the operation, he died shortly thereafter from the effects of his wounds.
00:53:46.38 --> 00:53:57.22 Again, you just got surgeons mixing blood and not clean and not even cutting off clothes
00:53:57.22 --> 00:53:58.22 or sterilizing.
00:53:58.22 --> 00:54:02.50 I mean, the amount of people that must have lost from the infections after the fact
00:54:02.50 --> 00:54:09.70 is just crazy.
00:54:09.70 --> 00:54:13.02 Now they weren't fighting all the time.
00:54:13.02 --> 00:54:17.90 And at this point, they are quartered into house and Spain and again, Spain was divided
00:54:17.90 --> 00:54:24.86 at the time and there was friendly and enemy, Spain and so they are quartered in a house
00:54:24.86 --> 00:54:26.94 and there's a family there.
00:54:26.94 --> 00:54:30.82 Here we go to the book, the mistress of the house, seeing that I was the head man, occasionally
00:54:30.82 --> 00:54:36.78 came down and sat beside me as I worked, bringing her daughter, a very handsome, dark-eyed
00:54:36.78 --> 00:54:42.22 Spanish girl and as a matter of course, I fell in love.
00:54:42.22 --> 00:54:47.18 We soon became better acquainted and the mother one evening having sat and chattered to
00:54:47.18 --> 00:54:52.26 me serving me with wine and other good things on my rising to leave the shop made a signal
00:54:52.26 --> 00:54:54.54 for me to follow her.
00:54:54.54 --> 00:54:58.98 She had managed to pick up a little English and I knew a few words of the Spanish language
00:54:58.98 --> 00:55:02.30 so that we could pretty well comprehend each other's meeting.
00:55:02.30 --> 00:55:07.26 And after leading me into their sitting room, she brought in her handsome daughter and without
00:55:07.26 --> 00:55:12.30 more circumstances offered her to me for a wife.
00:55:12.30 --> 00:55:16.74 The offer was attempting one, but the conditions of the marriage made it impossible for me
00:55:16.74 --> 00:55:21.58 to comply since I was to change my religion and dessert my colors.
00:55:21.58 --> 00:55:27.26 The old-dame proposed to conceal me, effectively, when the army marched after which I was
00:55:27.26 --> 00:55:33.26 to live like a gentleman with the handsome Maria for a life.
00:55:33.26 --> 00:55:39.02 It was hard to refuse so tempting and offer with pretty Maria endeavering to back her mother's
00:55:39.02 --> 00:55:41.02 proposal.
00:55:41.02 --> 00:55:46.14 I, however, made them understand that nothing would tempt me to dessert and promising
00:55:46.14 --> 00:55:51.34 to try and get my discharge when I returned to England, I protested I would then return
00:55:51.34 --> 00:55:54.78 and marry Maria.
00:55:54.78 --> 00:56:01.06 Soon after this the army marched for Spain, the rifles paraded in the very street where
00:56:01.06 --> 00:56:08.94 the shop I had so long worked at was situated and I saw Maria at the window.
00:56:08.94 --> 00:56:13.42 As our bugle struck up, she waved her handkerchief.
00:56:13.42 --> 00:56:20.26 I returned the salute and in half an hour had forgotten all about her.
00:56:20.26 --> 00:56:26.86 So much for the soldiers love that I read that and I said, I have to read this.
00:56:26.86 --> 00:56:33.34 This is to every 18, 19, 20 and 21 year old service member out there that you made the
00:56:33.34 --> 00:56:38.46 girlier dreams and you think you're going to do some dumb stuff.
00:56:38.46 --> 00:56:41.22 Don't do the dumb stuff.
00:56:41.22 --> 00:56:47.34 Go back to your platoon and in a half an hour you'll forget about her because that's what
00:56:47.34 --> 00:56:48.34 happens.
00:56:48.34 --> 00:56:55.02 Such so much for a soldier's love.
00:56:55.02 --> 00:56:58.86 Back to the book, every man in the rifle seemed only anxious to get a wrap at the French
00:56:58.86 --> 00:57:01.42 again.
00:57:01.42 --> 00:57:05.78 On a non-weed toiled, I love to remember the appearance of that army as we moved along
00:57:05.78 --> 00:57:06.78 at this time.
00:57:06.78 --> 00:57:10.10 It was a glorious sight to see our colors spread in these fields.
00:57:10.10 --> 00:57:11.86 The men seemed invincible.
00:57:11.86 --> 00:57:19.06 Nothing I thought could have beaten them.
00:57:19.06 --> 00:57:23.70 He's talking about a guy named Cardo.
00:57:23.70 --> 00:57:28.26 He was found to be a most gallant officer when we were engaged with the enemy in the field.
00:57:28.26 --> 00:57:33.74 He was killed whilst fighting bravely in the Pyrenees and amongst other Jewry he wore, he had
00:57:33.74 --> 00:57:37.86 a ring on his finger worth 150 guineas.
00:57:37.86 --> 00:57:43.18 He lay dead on the field one of our rifle, rifleman named Orr, observed the sparkling
00:57:43.18 --> 00:57:47.10 gem and immediately resolved to make a prize of it.
00:57:47.10 --> 00:57:51.42 The ring however was so firmly fixed that Orr could not draw it from the finger and whipping
00:57:51.42 --> 00:57:55.94 out his knife cut the finger off at the joint.
00:57:55.94 --> 00:58:01.14 After the battle or offered the ring for sale amongst the officers and on inquiry the
00:58:01.14 --> 00:58:05.46 manner in which he obtained it transpired.
00:58:05.46 --> 00:58:14.10 Orr was in consequence, tried by court martial and sent us to receive 500 lashes which
00:58:14.10 --> 00:58:16.70 sentenced his carried into execution.
00:58:16.70 --> 00:58:23.78 There's some significant corpal punishment going on here with the lashes and that's
00:58:23.78 --> 00:58:24.78 one of the cases.
00:58:24.78 --> 00:58:29.70 I mean, you know when you're executing someone for being drunk and disorderly, you're
00:58:29.70 --> 00:58:33.78 going to get some pretty severe punishment for cutting the finger off of one of your officers
00:58:33.78 --> 00:58:39.62 so you can steal their ring.
00:58:39.62 --> 00:58:43.14 Back to the book it was during the heat of the day we were rather hotly pressed by the
00:58:43.14 --> 00:58:46.98 enemy after having advanced somewhat to near their force.
00:58:46.98 --> 00:58:51.50 Given take is all fair enough but we were getting more kicks than half-pence as the saying
00:58:51.50 --> 00:58:58.30 is and their balls stung us so sharply that the officers gave the word to fire and retire.
00:58:58.30 --> 00:59:04.10 Outless, many got a lead in messenger as they did so which saved them the unpleasant necessity
00:59:04.10 --> 00:59:08.94 of retracing their ground altogether.
00:59:08.94 --> 00:59:14.30 Jock Gillespie and myself wheeled about and obeyed the order.
00:59:14.30 --> 00:59:19.82 Just as we had done so I saw Gillespie limp along as though someone had bestowed a violent
00:59:19.82 --> 00:59:22.22 kick upon his person.
00:59:22.22 --> 00:59:27.42 However he didn't give up at first but continued to load and fire and make off with other
00:59:27.42 --> 00:59:32.94 scourmetures to we halted and made another stand.
00:59:32.94 --> 00:59:38.46 For we never went further from them when once engaged then we could possibly help.
00:59:38.46 --> 00:59:42.70 I'm going to read that again.
00:59:42.70 --> 00:59:48.10 We continued to load and fire and make off with other scourmetures to we halted and made
00:59:48.10 --> 00:59:54.94 another stand for we never went further from them when once engaged then we could possibly
00:59:54.94 --> 00:59:59.90 help and what that means is covered move.
00:59:59.90 --> 01:00:05.46 So if you are out on the battlefield and you get too far away from the other element where
01:00:05.46 --> 01:00:09.62 you can no longer support them you've made a big mistake.
01:00:09.62 --> 01:00:17.18 So that's why they have doctrinal terms that mean I am in supporting distance.
01:00:17.18 --> 01:00:21.94 I won't go further away from you than where I can't help you.
01:00:21.94 --> 01:00:32.54 All right now speaking of lashing is there's another situation here.
01:00:32.54 --> 01:00:39.58 There was sort of a ceremony where they were gathering and standing in the parade sort
01:00:39.58 --> 01:00:47.98 of in a town square and somebody basically threw I think like a brick.
01:00:47.98 --> 01:00:51.50 One of the soldiers from one of the windows that was watching the other regiment.
01:00:51.50 --> 01:00:54.86 So there's one regiment standing on the parade field, handing out a wars or something.
01:00:54.86 --> 01:01:01.58 The other regiment sitting up in the various rooms around looking down and at some point
01:01:01.58 --> 01:01:08.54 this someone hooks a brick down and it hits the kernel.
01:01:08.54 --> 01:01:15.34 So this guy, Listen, was the guy that they grab and they think it's this guy, Listen,
01:01:15.34 --> 01:01:16.34 back to the book.
01:01:16.34 --> 01:01:21.70 Listen was sentenced to receive 800 lashes. The whole brigade turned out on the occasion and
01:01:21.70 --> 01:01:28.22 I remember that the drummers of the night regiment were the inflictors of the lash.
01:01:28.22 --> 01:01:35.86 Listened, Listen received the whole sentence without a murmur.
01:01:35.86 --> 01:01:39.10 This is a him talking about.
01:01:39.10 --> 01:01:44.74 As he goes on to talk about how this strict discipline about it and how it kind of fits
01:01:44.74 --> 01:01:48.38 in with the English mentality back to the book.
01:01:48.38 --> 01:01:54.02 They are strange set the English and so determined and unconscribable that they will have
01:01:54.02 --> 01:01:55.66 their way if they can.
01:01:55.66 --> 01:01:57.14 Think about that.
01:01:57.14 --> 01:02:03.26 Your soldiers, it's a great quality to have right your determined and unconscribable.
01:02:03.26 --> 01:02:04.26 But what does that mean?
01:02:04.26 --> 01:02:05.98 I mean you're going to have your way if you can.
01:02:05.98 --> 01:02:08.86 If you let them, they're going to get after it.
01:02:08.86 --> 01:02:11.10 Maybe in a good way you don't expect.
01:02:11.10 --> 01:02:16.94 Indeed, back to the book it indeed, it requires one who has authority in his face as
01:02:16.94 --> 01:02:21.30 well as at his back to make them respect and obey him.
01:02:21.30 --> 01:02:26.62 They see too often in the instance of sergeant majors that command does not suit ignorant
01:02:26.62 --> 01:02:29.18 and course-minded men.
01:02:29.18 --> 01:02:35.18 And that tyranny is too much used even in the brief authority which they have.
01:02:35.18 --> 01:02:37.98 So again, he's going back to the fact that even though you have to have, he's talking
01:02:37.98 --> 01:02:41.38 about the dichotomy of leadership, even though you have to have discipline, you can't have
01:02:41.38 --> 01:02:43.90 tyranny.
01:02:43.90 --> 01:02:49.50 Back to the book, a soldier I'm convinced is driven often to in subordination by being worried
01:02:49.50 --> 01:02:57.06 by these little-minded men for the various trifles about which the gentleman never thinks
01:02:57.06 --> 01:02:58.30 of tormenting him.
01:02:58.30 --> 01:03:06.62 So the little-minded person that harps on these little trifling things, that's what actually
01:03:06.62 --> 01:03:11.90 creates in subordination, whereas the gentleman never thinks of tormenting him with these
01:03:11.90 --> 01:03:14.18 little things.
01:03:14.18 --> 01:03:17.66 Like these little things don't matter.
01:03:17.66 --> 01:03:21.90 Then he goes on to balance this dichotomy of leadership back to the book, the moment
01:03:21.90 --> 01:03:28.38 the severity of the discipline of our army is relaxed in my opinion, farewell to its efficiency.
01:03:28.38 --> 01:03:35.14 But for men to be tormented about trifles, as I've seen at many times, is often very
01:03:35.14 --> 01:03:37.30 injurious to the whole core.
01:03:37.30 --> 01:03:42.10 So this is the perfect talking about the balance of the dichotomy of leadership.
01:03:42.10 --> 01:03:47.30 If you're too altruist, your guys are going to rebel against you, and if you're not strict
01:03:47.30 --> 01:03:51.06 enough, or you don't impose enough discipline, they're going to not have any control.
01:03:51.06 --> 01:04:01.26 So you've got to balance these two.
01:04:01.26 --> 01:04:05.38 Going forward back to the book, war is a sad blunter of the feelings of men.
01:04:05.38 --> 01:04:07.50 He said that before, and he's saying it again.
01:04:07.50 --> 01:04:11.98 We felt eager to be added again.
01:04:11.98 --> 01:04:17.46 Nay, I am afraid we longed for blood as the cheer of our comrades sounded in our ears,
01:04:17.46 --> 01:04:22.40 and yet amidst all this, softer feelings occasionally filled the breasts of those gallant
01:04:22.40 --> 01:04:27.10 fellows, even whilst they were thirsting for the sight of the enemy.
01:04:27.10 --> 01:04:32.42 Some of the men near me suddenly recollected as they saw the snow lying thickly on our
01:04:32.42 --> 01:04:36.14 past path that this was Christmas Eve.
01:04:36.14 --> 01:04:41.02 The recollection soon spread amongst the men, and many talk to home and scenes upon
01:04:41.02 --> 01:04:45.22 that night in the other days of the old England shedding tears as they spoke of the
01:04:45.22 --> 01:04:50.42 relative's and friends never to be seen again by them.
01:04:50.42 --> 01:04:53.86 As night approached, we became less talkative.
01:04:53.86 --> 01:04:59.70 The increasing weiriness of our limbs kept our tongues quieter, and we were many of us half
01:04:59.70 --> 01:05:05.22 a sleep as we walked when suddenly a shout arose in the front that the French were upon
01:05:05.22 --> 01:05:07.66 us.
01:05:07.66 --> 01:05:09.94 So guys are missing home.
01:05:09.94 --> 01:05:11.46 It's Christmas Eve.
01:05:11.46 --> 01:05:17.66 Nice little dusting of snow on the ground.
01:05:17.66 --> 01:05:22.10 They have this skirmish with the French there, and now they're continuing the first
01:05:22.10 --> 01:05:23.10 march.
01:05:23.10 --> 01:05:27.10 If you remember the march that we talked about with Napoleon's troops going into Russia
01:05:27.10 --> 01:05:32.66 and back, these guys are under the same basic conditions of if you want to move the
01:05:32.66 --> 01:05:36.26 army, the army is going to walk.
01:05:36.26 --> 01:05:37.78 Back to the book, a sergeant of the night.
01:05:37.78 --> 01:05:42.82 So he's now on this also, not only they forced marching right now, they're starting to
01:05:42.82 --> 01:05:43.82 retreat.
01:05:43.82 --> 01:05:48.82 They're starting to take heavies, and they start a retreat.
01:05:48.82 --> 01:05:53.38 Back to the book, a sergeant of the 90 second highlanders just about this time fell dead with
01:05:53.38 --> 01:05:58.98 fatigue, and no one stopped as we passed off for a many assistance.
01:05:58.98 --> 01:06:00.50 Night came down upon us.
01:06:00.50 --> 01:06:01.78 So let's think about that.
01:06:01.78 --> 01:06:05.58 And this, I highlighted that one, but throughout this book he talks about people that
01:06:05.58 --> 01:06:07.62 is dying, and he says they died of fatigue.
01:06:07.62 --> 01:06:10.54 I even know what that means actually.
01:06:10.54 --> 01:06:11.54 Maybe they're dehydrated.
01:06:11.54 --> 01:06:12.86 I don't know.
01:06:12.86 --> 01:06:17.06 But if you think about these guys who are risking their lives for each other, how exhausted
01:06:17.06 --> 01:06:20.50 are they that when someone falls out during this first march, the forced march, they just
01:06:20.50 --> 01:06:24.74 leave them there.
01:06:24.74 --> 01:06:30.50 Back to the book, night came down upon us without our having tasted food or halted.
01:06:30.50 --> 01:06:35.50 I speak for myself and those around me, all and all night long we continued this dreadful
01:06:35.50 --> 01:06:36.50 march.
01:06:36.50 --> 01:06:39.90 Men began to look into each other's faces and ask the questions.
01:06:39.90 --> 01:06:42.94 Ask the question, are we ever to be halted again?
01:06:42.94 --> 01:06:48.22 Many of the weaker sort were now seen to stagger, make a few desperate efforts, and then
01:06:48.22 --> 01:06:52.54 fall, perhaps, to rise no more.
01:06:52.54 --> 01:06:57.90 Most of us had devoured all we cared in our haversax, and each and in, and endeavored
01:06:57.90 --> 01:07:03.38 to catch up anything we could snatch from a hut or cottage in our route.
01:07:03.38 --> 01:07:08.38 Many, even at this period, would have struggled from the ranks and perished, had not
01:07:08.38 --> 01:07:12.98 crowdfered, held them together with a firm rain.
01:07:12.98 --> 01:07:18.38 One such bold and stern commander in the east, during a memorable disaster, and that
01:07:18.38 --> 01:07:22.14 devoted army had reached its refuge unbroken.
01:07:22.14 --> 01:07:28.10 Thus we staggered on night and day for about four days before we discovered the reason
01:07:28.10 --> 01:07:31.74 of this forced march.
01:07:31.74 --> 01:07:36.22 And they find out that they're marching actually towards England, they're trying to get
01:07:36.22 --> 01:07:43.82 away, and this guy that I talked about Crawford, he's pretty significant.
01:07:43.82 --> 01:07:46.14 And here's a little talk about Crawford.
01:07:46.14 --> 01:07:51.10 Crawford seemed to sniff the sound of battle from afar with peculiar feelings.
01:07:51.10 --> 01:07:55.54 He halted us for a few minutes occasionally when the distant clamor became more distinct,
01:07:55.54 --> 01:08:01.54 and his face turned toward the sound and seemed to light up and become less stern.
01:08:01.54 --> 01:08:06.46 He was then indeed that every poor fellow clutched his weapon more firmly and wished for
01:08:06.46 --> 01:08:09.22 a sight of the enemy.
01:08:09.22 --> 01:08:11.22 Before long they had their wish.
01:08:11.22 --> 01:08:16.54 The enemy's cavalry were on our skirts that night, and as we rushed out of a small village,
01:08:16.54 --> 01:08:20.90 we turned to bay.
01:08:20.90 --> 01:08:24.90 So even though they were treating, they're still having to fight.
01:08:24.90 --> 01:08:31.06 And this again, this guy Crawford is definitely a powerful leader back to the book.
01:08:31.06 --> 01:08:35.46 I remember one evening during the retreat, he detected two men straying away from the main
01:08:35.46 --> 01:08:36.46 body.
01:08:36.46 --> 01:08:43.12 It was in the early stage of that disastrous flight and Crawford knew, and Crawford knew
01:08:43.12 --> 01:08:47.38 well that he must do his utmost to keep the division together.
01:08:47.38 --> 01:08:52.14 He halted the brigade with a voice of thunder, ordered a drum-head court martial on
01:08:52.14 --> 01:08:56.18 the instant, and they were sentenced to a hundred apiece.
01:08:56.18 --> 01:09:01.58 Allstahasty trial was taking place, Crawford dismounting from his horse stood in the
01:09:01.58 --> 01:09:06.90 midst, looking stern and angry as a worried bulldog.
01:09:06.90 --> 01:09:13.14 He did not like retreating at all that man.
01:09:13.14 --> 01:09:18.22 They march a little bit further, and then back to the book, ordering a square to be formed.
01:09:18.22 --> 01:09:22.98 He spoke to the brigade as well as I can remember in these words, after having ordered
01:09:22.98 --> 01:09:29.10 the three before named men of the 95th to be brought to the square.
01:09:29.10 --> 01:09:35.74 Although he said, I should obtain the goodwill neither of the officers nor the men of
01:09:35.74 --> 01:09:40.62 the brigade here by doing so, I am resolved to punish these three men according to the
01:09:40.62 --> 01:09:45.66 sentence awarded, even though the French are at our heels.
01:09:45.66 --> 01:09:48.54 Begin with Daniel Hauens.
01:09:48.54 --> 01:09:53.66 So these guys were looked like they were going to desert and they got caught and he had
01:09:53.66 --> 01:09:57.62 a court martial on the spot and he was going to give them a hundred lashes or whatever
01:09:57.62 --> 01:09:59.46 the number was.
01:09:59.46 --> 01:10:05.46 And even though they were running and retreating, he's, alright, we're going to administer
01:10:05.46 --> 01:10:10.62 this punishment now, even though it's not popular, I got to do it.
01:10:10.62 --> 01:10:14.78 Back to the book, this was indeed no time to be lax and discipline in the general knew it.
01:10:14.78 --> 01:10:21.78 The men, as I said, were some of them, becoming careless and roughly in their demeanor,
01:10:21.78 --> 01:10:27.22 whilst others again I saw with the tears falling down their cheeks from the agony of their
01:10:27.22 --> 01:10:32.26 bleeding feet and many were ill with dysentery and from the effects of bad food they had
01:10:32.26 --> 01:10:34.74 got a hold of and devoured on the road.
01:10:34.74 --> 01:10:39.26 Our Napsacks, too, were a bitter enemy in this prolonged march.
01:10:39.26 --> 01:10:43.78 Many a man died, I am convinced, who would have borne up well to the end of the retreat,
01:10:43.78 --> 01:10:47.94 but for the infernal load we carried on our backs.
01:10:47.94 --> 01:10:51.10 My own Napsack was my bitterest enemy.
01:10:51.10 --> 01:10:56.34 I felt it pressed me to the earth almost at times and more than once felt as if I should
01:10:56.34 --> 01:10:59.42 die under its deadly embrace.
01:10:59.42 --> 01:11:03.54 The Napsacks, in my opinion, should have been abandoned at the very commencement of the
01:11:03.54 --> 01:11:08.62 retrograde movement, as it would have been better to have lost them all together, if,
01:11:08.62 --> 01:11:14.38 by such loss, we could have saved the poor fellows who, as it was, died strapped to them
01:11:14.38 --> 01:11:18.18 on the road.
01:11:18.18 --> 01:11:22.74 There was some difficulty in finding a place to tie howling's up, as the light brigade
01:11:22.74 --> 01:11:25.70 carried no halberts.
01:11:25.70 --> 01:11:30.14 However, they led him to a slender astree which grew near at hand.
01:11:30.14 --> 01:11:34.90 Don't trouble yourselves about tying me up, said howling's folding his arms, I'll take
01:11:34.90 --> 01:11:38.30 my punishment like a man.
01:11:38.30 --> 01:11:42.94 He did so without a murmur receiving the whole 300.
01:11:42.94 --> 01:11:49.34 His wife, who was present with us, I remember was a strong, hearty Irish woman.
01:11:49.34 --> 01:11:54.10 So, I don't worry about tying me up, you hit me 300 times.
01:11:54.10 --> 01:11:59.78 We had a, you know they do the whipping thing with the, when you get your belt.
01:11:59.78 --> 01:12:07.18 Do you remember Irish John, you tall, pretty lanky and real good at your jitsu, and he
01:12:07.18 --> 01:12:09.38 got his blue belt.
01:12:09.38 --> 01:12:16.98 And he walked through the whipping hallway to get his belt, the gauntlet, he walked through
01:12:16.98 --> 01:12:22.90 the gauntlet, he just walked and stopped at each person and gave them the opportunity
01:12:22.90 --> 01:12:25.02 to give them all they got.
01:12:25.02 --> 01:12:27.70 That was pretty legit.
01:12:27.70 --> 01:12:36.22 He sounds like he sounds like my, he sounds like my boy, howling's right here.
01:12:36.22 --> 01:12:39.66 More about Crawford right here, this is classic.
01:12:39.66 --> 01:12:43.54 They're, they're getting to a river, they got across a river on their retreat.
01:12:43.54 --> 01:12:47.82 Back to the book, presently he spied an officer who to save himself from being wet through.
01:12:47.82 --> 01:12:52.34 I suppose, and wearing a damp pair of breeches for the remainder of the day, had mounted
01:12:52.34 --> 01:12:57.18 on the back of one of his men.
01:12:57.18 --> 01:13:02.50 The sight of such a piece of a feminacy was enough to raise the collar of the general,
01:13:02.50 --> 01:13:07.66 and in a very short time he was plunging and splashing through the water after them both,
01:13:07.66 --> 01:13:09.82 put him down, sir, put him down.
01:13:09.82 --> 01:13:14.18 I desire you to put that officer down instantly, and the soldier in an instant, I dare
01:13:14.18 --> 01:13:19.42 say, while dropping his burden like a hot potato into the stream continued his progress
01:13:19.42 --> 01:13:20.42 through.
01:13:20.42 --> 01:13:23.78 Return back, sir, said Crawford to the officer.
01:13:23.78 --> 01:13:25.50 And go through the water like the others.
01:13:25.50 --> 01:13:30.54 I will not allow my officers to ride upon the men's back through the rivers.
01:13:30.54 --> 01:13:33.66 They'll must take their share of light here.
01:13:33.66 --> 01:13:37.74 You can just go ahead and note that down as how to lead.
01:13:37.74 --> 01:13:43.02 That's just, that's a metaphorical and literal example.
01:13:43.02 --> 01:13:49.58 Hey, I'm going to ride on the back of my enlisted man so that I can stay dry.
01:13:49.58 --> 01:13:50.82 What a savage.
01:13:50.82 --> 01:13:53.66 I think that, that guy should have gotten some lashes.
01:13:53.66 --> 01:13:58.18 Back to the book, General Crawford was indeed one of the few men who was apparently
01:13:58.18 --> 01:14:03.42 created for the command during such dreadful scenes as we were familiar with in this retreat.
01:14:03.42 --> 01:14:09.10 He seemed an iron man, nothing dented him, nothing turned him from his purpose.
01:14:09.10 --> 01:14:12.34 War was his very element.
01:14:12.34 --> 01:14:21.90 And toil and danger seemed to call forth and increasing determination to surmount them.
01:14:21.90 --> 01:14:31.10 I'll let you get it. Now they are continuing to march and again, it's a story we've
01:14:31.10 --> 01:14:36.42 heard many times on here and how harsh foot marches can be.
01:14:36.42 --> 01:14:42.62 And at this point, rifleman Harris, he doesn't think he's going to make it.
01:14:42.62 --> 01:14:44.90 And he's fading fast.
01:14:44.90 --> 01:14:46.46 He's marching with a guy named Brooks.
01:14:46.46 --> 01:14:50.78 They're kind of broken up into pairs to try and stay together a little bit.
01:14:50.78 --> 01:14:53.62 He's trying to maintain back to the book.
01:14:53.62 --> 01:14:57.14 I remember sir, Dudley Hill passing me on a muel this day.
01:14:57.14 --> 01:15:00.14 He wore a Spanish straw hat and had his cloak on.
01:15:00.14 --> 01:15:02.54 He looked back when he had passed and addressed me.
01:15:02.54 --> 01:15:07.30 Harris said he, I see you cannot keep up.
01:15:07.30 --> 01:15:10.58 He peered very sorry for me for he knew me well.
01:15:10.58 --> 01:15:15.06 You must do your best, he said, my man and keep up with us.
01:15:15.06 --> 01:15:18.38 Or you will fall into the hands of the enemy.
01:15:18.38 --> 01:15:24.46 As the day wore on, I grew weaker and weaker and at last, spite all of my efforts.
01:15:24.46 --> 01:15:29.38 I saw the main body leave me hopelessly in the lurch.
01:15:29.38 --> 01:15:31.38 Brooks himself was getting weaker too.
01:15:31.38 --> 01:15:37.14 He saw it was a little used to urge me on and at length, ascending to my repeated requests
01:15:37.14 --> 01:15:39.38 to be left behind.
01:15:39.38 --> 01:15:41.82 He hurried on as well.
01:15:41.82 --> 01:15:47.06 And he was able without a word of farewell.
01:15:47.06 --> 01:15:52.74 I now soon sank down in the road and lay beside another man who had also fallen was apparently
01:15:52.74 --> 01:16:06.78 dead and whom I'd recognized as one of our sergeants named Taylor.
01:16:06.78 --> 01:16:12.46 Whilst we lay exhausted in the road, the rear guard, which was now endeavouring to drive
01:16:12.46 --> 01:16:17.02 on the stragglers approached and a sergeant of the rifles came up and stopped and look at
01:16:17.02 --> 01:16:18.66 us.
01:16:18.66 --> 01:16:22.86 He addressed himself to me and ordered me to rise, but I told him it was useless for him
01:16:22.86 --> 01:16:29.10 to trouble himself about me as I was unable to move a step further.
01:16:29.10 --> 01:16:33.34 Whilst he was urging me to endeavor to rise up, the officer in command of the rear guard
01:16:33.34 --> 01:16:35.30 also stepped up.
01:16:35.30 --> 01:16:37.86 The name of this officer was Lieutenant Cox.
01:16:37.86 --> 01:16:41.98 He was a brave and good man and observing that the sergeant was rough in his language
01:16:41.98 --> 01:16:49.10 and manner towards me, he silenced him and bade the guard proceed and leave me.
01:16:49.10 --> 01:16:50.74 Bet him die quietly, Hicks.
01:16:50.74 --> 01:16:55.98 He said to the sergeant, I know him well, he's not a man to lie here if he could get on.
01:16:55.98 --> 01:16:58.62 I'm sorry, Harris.
01:16:58.62 --> 01:17:06.02 He said to see you reduced to this fright fear, there is no help to be had now.
01:17:06.02 --> 01:17:15.18 He then moved on after his men and left me to my fate.
01:17:15.18 --> 01:17:17.26 Lot different than never leave a man behind.
01:17:17.26 --> 01:17:19.26 You've actually got people disengue.
01:17:19.26 --> 01:17:20.74 You're not going to make it.
01:17:20.74 --> 01:17:21.98 I can see you're not going to make it.
01:17:21.98 --> 01:17:29.34 I know you're a tough guy and if you're not walking right now, there's nothing for you.
01:17:29.34 --> 01:17:34.30 Now he lays there for a while and he actually wants to rest for a while.
01:17:34.30 --> 01:17:40.70 He regains a little bit of strength, he eventually crawls to a house, gets in the house
01:17:40.70 --> 01:17:45.62 and gets a little bit of food, gets a little bit of, I would love to say water, but
01:17:45.62 --> 01:17:48.98 he's not going to get his food and wine.
01:17:48.98 --> 01:17:54.26 He recovers somewhat, he pretty much recovers.
01:17:54.26 --> 01:17:59.90 Sleeps for a while wakes up, recovers and now he can walk again.
01:17:59.90 --> 01:18:04.46 What do you think would happen now?
01:18:04.46 --> 01:18:09.98 In a case as similar to this as possible, you know, but just now where I can't make it,
01:18:09.98 --> 01:18:11.22 what do you do, carry him?
01:18:11.22 --> 01:18:13.26 Yeah, you'd try and carry him, of course.
01:18:13.26 --> 01:18:14.26 Other guys, guys.
01:18:14.26 --> 01:18:23.94 Yeah, and it's horrible to think of these situations where if we have to move these men
01:18:23.94 --> 01:18:26.90 and to sit there, let's away this.
01:18:26.90 --> 01:18:31.66 You have to weigh this, if we try and carry it all over a wounded out, none of us are going
01:18:31.66 --> 01:18:32.66 to live.
01:18:32.66 --> 01:18:37.42 That's what that's the situation that they're likely facing.
01:18:37.42 --> 01:18:42.02 Hey, you're either going to get out of here yourself and people don't understand how hard
01:18:42.02 --> 01:18:43.54 it is to carry it down, man.
01:18:43.54 --> 01:18:46.90 It's very, very difficult to carry it down, man.
01:18:46.90 --> 01:18:50.90 Especially across terrain, you know, sometimes in wrestling practice, you pick up and
01:18:50.90 --> 01:18:53.66 you pick up your partner and you do a couple of laps, right?
01:18:53.66 --> 01:18:57.10 Yeah, you know, that's all good, you're on a nice smooth surface.
01:18:57.10 --> 01:19:02.30 Because cooperating is not just dead weight, yeah, when you start carrying bodies around,
01:19:02.30 --> 01:19:04.78 it's really, really difficult.
01:19:04.78 --> 01:19:07.26 So you don't, it's not a one to one either.
01:19:07.26 --> 01:19:11.90 So if one guy is down, it's not just one person carries that guy.
01:19:11.90 --> 01:19:14.46 It actually has to be two or sometimes three.
01:19:14.46 --> 01:19:19.58 When you have gear on, and we have methods of carrying guys, I mean, I can carry you
01:19:19.58 --> 01:19:28.30 a little while, right? But after a little while, you know, be that 500 meters, 1000 meters,
01:19:28.30 --> 01:19:30.62 you're not going to be here for, and also you're combat in effect.
01:19:30.62 --> 01:19:36.50 If you can't, you can't utilize your weapon properly, not for, not for any length of time.
01:19:36.50 --> 01:19:40.42 So, you know, in a situation like this, that the decision that these leaders are making
01:19:40.42 --> 01:19:42.14 is, hey, guess what?
01:19:42.14 --> 01:19:45.02 If we don't just keep walking, we're going to get overrun.
01:19:45.02 --> 01:19:47.10 The French are going to catch us and we're all going to die.
01:19:47.10 --> 01:19:49.50 So Harris, you got nothing for you.
01:19:49.50 --> 01:19:54.30 So in content like now, we'll say that if there was a circumstance like that, where we're
01:19:54.30 --> 01:20:03.42 going to lose more guys if we bring this guy with us or one big luxury that we have now
01:20:03.42 --> 01:20:05.42 is we have air support.
01:20:05.42 --> 01:20:08.46 So the enemy wants to keep coming out of us, cool.
01:20:08.46 --> 01:20:10.78 We'll sit here and call drop bombs on them all day.
01:20:10.78 --> 01:20:14.06 The situations like that have happened over and over again in the modern wars.
01:20:14.06 --> 01:20:19.18 And in Iraq and Afghanistan, where small elements are out there in the field, they're about
01:20:19.18 --> 01:20:24.70 to get overrun and the aircraft and air, air power comes in and completely saves the
01:20:24.70 --> 01:20:29.06 day and keeps the enemy at bay for extended periods of time.
01:20:29.06 --> 01:20:32.90 So we have an option, another option.
01:20:32.90 --> 01:20:36.10 But in the, I guess, the ultimately be hypothetical then.
01:20:36.10 --> 01:20:37.10 The case.
01:20:37.10 --> 01:20:39.94 So hypothetically, then you got to put someone in that situation and see what they're
01:20:39.94 --> 01:20:40.94 going to do.
01:20:40.94 --> 01:20:44.02 And that's the decision you got to make as a leader on the spot.
01:20:44.02 --> 01:20:45.02 Yeah.
01:20:45.02 --> 01:20:46.02 Yeah.
01:20:46.02 --> 01:20:51.66 I mean, you be weighing all these micro micro facets that are happening.
01:20:51.66 --> 01:20:53.26 How far away are the bad guys?
01:20:53.26 --> 01:20:54.26 Yeah.
01:20:54.26 --> 01:20:55.26 Well, how many of them are there?
01:20:55.26 --> 01:20:56.58 Do I reinforcements coming?
01:20:56.58 --> 01:20:57.98 Is there any terrain I can take?
01:20:57.98 --> 01:21:00.02 Is there what, you know, what can I do?
01:21:00.02 --> 01:21:01.74 How many people are down?
01:21:01.74 --> 01:21:02.74 Yeah.
01:21:02.74 --> 01:21:04.66 You do have to weigh all these things out and make a decision.
01:21:04.66 --> 01:21:06.06 It's going to be hard decision.
01:21:06.06 --> 01:21:07.06 Yeah, for sure.
01:21:07.06 --> 01:21:13.98 I mean, so you don't put like the the concept or should I say, like the action.
01:21:13.98 --> 01:21:21.46 The action of at least trying to bring the guy with you ahead of like other guys lives.
01:21:21.46 --> 01:21:27.98 So I'm a certain circumstance like this where you have to, you don't have any content.
01:21:27.98 --> 01:21:28.98 You don't have any support.
01:21:28.98 --> 01:21:30.46 You don't have any other options.
01:21:30.46 --> 01:21:35.66 It's either other guys die or we leave this guy behind.
01:21:35.66 --> 01:21:45.34 The fact that you tried to bring the guy doesn't Trump like the lives of other guys.
01:21:45.34 --> 01:21:49.50 If the decision is to be made where it's understood like other guys would have died.
01:21:49.50 --> 01:21:53.06 If we didn't leave this guy here, that would be okay.
01:21:53.06 --> 01:21:57.46 It's not gonna be okay and you're gonna have to live with one horrible thought or the
01:21:57.46 --> 01:21:58.46 other.
01:21:58.46 --> 01:21:59.74 Right, right.
01:21:59.74 --> 01:22:03.10 The thing that's powerful about we're not gonna leave everything anyone behind.
01:22:03.10 --> 01:22:09.02 The thing that's powerful about that is if that's your default mode, your default mode is
01:22:09.02 --> 01:22:12.26 to fight and that's what that's a we train.
01:22:12.26 --> 01:22:16.14 That's when I say we I mean like America trains, we're not gonna leave you behind.
01:22:16.14 --> 01:22:20.26 And so when that's your go to attitude, that's your go to attitude.
01:22:20.26 --> 01:22:24.74 And all the thoughts about hey, we'll weigh it out and there's like no we're gonna fight,
01:22:24.74 --> 01:22:28.78 we're gonna kill everyone and we're gonna do everything we can to bring everyone back
01:22:28.78 --> 01:22:30.26 that's what we do.
01:22:30.26 --> 01:22:32.46 And that is a powerful thing.
01:22:32.46 --> 01:22:35.30 Yeah, man, these are savage times.
01:22:35.30 --> 01:22:39.90 These are savage times, savage times.
01:22:39.90 --> 01:22:44.94 Going, so like I said, he does recover though, luckily before the French get to him,
01:22:44.94 --> 01:22:48.78 he recovers enough to get out start walking again.
01:22:48.78 --> 01:22:55.58 And he talks a little bit how he was clinging, I mean he was clinging to survival.
01:22:55.58 --> 01:23:00.54 Back to the book, it is however indeed astonishing how a man clings to life.
01:23:00.54 --> 01:23:05.42 I am certain that had I laying down at this period, I should have found my last billet
01:23:05.42 --> 01:23:08.42 on the spot I sank upon.
01:23:08.42 --> 01:23:14.74 Suddenly I heard a shout in the front, which was prolonged in a sort of hub hub.
01:23:14.74 --> 01:23:18.98 Even the stragglers who I saw dotting the road in front of me seem to have caught something
01:23:18.98 --> 01:23:20.90 like hope.
01:23:20.90 --> 01:23:25.94 And as the poor fellows now reach the top of the hill where a sending a hernicational exclamation
01:23:25.94 --> 01:23:31.82 of joy, the first note of the sort I had heard for many days, when I reached the top
01:23:31.82 --> 01:23:38.10 of the hill, the thing spoke for itself, their far away in our front, the English shipping
01:23:38.10 --> 01:23:40.66 lay inside.
01:23:40.66 --> 01:23:50.34 It's a view, had indeed acted like a restorative to our force and the men at the prospect
01:23:50.34 --> 01:23:56.58 of the termination of such a march had plucked up spirit for a last effort.
01:23:56.58 --> 01:24:02.26 Fellows who, like myself, seemed hardly have strengthened their legs to creep up the
01:24:02.26 --> 01:24:09.38 assent seemed now to have picked up a fresh pair to get down with, such as hope to us poor
01:24:09.38 --> 01:24:10.94 mortals.
01:24:10.94 --> 01:24:19.54 So they obviously see the ships and that inspires them and they start moving a little
01:24:19.54 --> 01:24:20.54 bit faster.
01:24:20.54 --> 01:24:27.18 Back to the book, there was a recollect of the name of Bell of the rifles who had been
01:24:27.18 --> 01:24:30.54 during this day holding a sort of creeping race with me.
01:24:30.54 --> 01:24:33.78 We had passed and repost each other as our strength served.
01:24:33.78 --> 01:24:37.62 Bell was a rather discontented fellow at the best of times.
01:24:37.62 --> 01:24:42.74 But during this retreat, he had given full scope to his ill temper, cursing the hour he
01:24:42.74 --> 01:24:47.70 was born and wishing his mother had strangled him when he came into the world in order
01:24:47.70 --> 01:24:51.94 to have saved him from his present toil.
01:24:51.94 --> 01:24:57.42 He had not now spoken for some time and the sight of the English shipping had apparently
01:24:57.42 --> 01:25:01.26 a very beneficial effect upon him.
01:25:01.26 --> 01:25:03.94 He burst into tears as he stood and looked at it.
01:25:03.94 --> 01:25:09.34 Harris, he said, if it pleases God to let me reach those ships, I swear never to utter
01:25:09.34 --> 01:25:16.50 a bad or discontented word again.
01:25:16.50 --> 01:25:18.02 Appreciation.
01:25:18.02 --> 01:25:26.10 And he did make to the ships and Harris, rifleman Harris made to the ships and they
01:25:26.10 --> 01:25:35.26 got embarked on those ships and they sailed back to England for a few days and then
01:25:35.26 --> 01:25:39.86 get off the English shore and then finally back to the book, one fine morning received
01:25:39.86 --> 01:25:47.06 orders to disembark and our poor bare feet once more touched English ground.
01:25:47.06 --> 01:25:51.66 The inhabitants flocked down to the beach to see us as we did so and they must have been
01:25:51.66 --> 01:25:56.94 a good deal surprised at the spectacle we presented.
01:25:56.94 --> 01:26:02.46 Our beards were long and ragged, almost all were without shoes and stockings.
01:26:02.46 --> 01:26:07.46 Many had their clothes and accoutrements and fragments with their heads swath in old rags
01:26:07.46 --> 01:26:13.66 and our weapons were covered with rust, whilst not a few had now from toil and fatigue
01:26:13.66 --> 01:26:17.34 become quite blind.
01:26:17.34 --> 01:26:24.34 Let not the reader however think that now we were to be despised as soldiers, long marches,
01:26:24.34 --> 01:26:29.78 inclement weather and want to food had done their work upon us but we were perhaps better
01:26:29.78 --> 01:26:33.50 than we appeared as the sequel showed.
01:26:33.50 --> 01:26:39.66 Under the gallant Crawford we had made some tremendous marches and even galt our enemy
01:26:39.66 --> 01:26:44.62 so severely making good our retreat.
01:26:44.62 --> 01:26:50.06 But our comrades in adversity who had retired by the other road under general more turned
01:26:50.06 --> 01:26:55.82 to bay there and showed the enemy that the English soldier is not to be beaten even under
01:26:55.82 --> 01:27:00.98 the most adverse circumstances.
01:27:00.98 --> 01:27:07.70 It fueled the death and slaughter, the march, the Bivouac and the retreat are no bad places
01:27:07.70 --> 01:27:12.42 in which to judge men.
01:27:12.42 --> 01:27:17.14 I have had some opportunities of judging them in all these situations and I should say
01:27:17.14 --> 01:27:22.14 that the British are amongst the most splendid soldiers in the world.
01:27:22.14 --> 01:27:26.66 Give them fair play and they are unconscribable.
01:27:26.66 --> 01:27:33.02 For my own part I can only say that I enjoyed life more whilst on active service than I
01:27:33.02 --> 01:27:36.38 have ever done since.
01:27:36.38 --> 01:27:44.18 And as I sit at work in my shop in Richmond Street, so ho, I look back upon that portion
01:27:44.18 --> 01:27:53.10 of my time spent in the field of the peninsula as the only part where the overmembrants.
01:27:53.10 --> 01:27:59.26 It is at such times that scenes long past come back upon my mind as if they had taken place
01:27:59.26 --> 01:28:02.90 but yesterday.
01:28:02.90 --> 01:28:13.18 I remember even the appearance of some regiments engaged in comrades long, molded to dust.
01:28:13.18 --> 01:28:30.62 I see again performing the acts of heroes.
01:28:30.62 --> 01:28:53.94 And I think it's safe to call Rifleman Benjamin Randall Harris a hero as well.
01:28:53.94 --> 01:29:06.34 And at the same time I think it's important to remember that these heroes are not super
01:29:06.34 --> 01:29:10.90 heroes like we see today in movies.
01:29:10.90 --> 01:29:12.14 They don't wear a cape.
01:29:12.14 --> 01:29:14.54 They don't have any superhuman strength.
01:29:14.54 --> 01:29:27.66 They have no special powers what they do have is they have will to fight the will to drive
01:29:27.66 --> 01:29:36.94 on the will to live the will to win.
01:29:36.94 --> 01:29:43.50 And I think that's the superpower.
01:29:43.50 --> 01:29:45.90 And it never ceases to amaze me.
01:29:45.90 --> 01:29:48.78 These are normal people.
01:29:48.78 --> 01:29:58.46 Rifleman Harris was a normal guy like us.
01:29:58.46 --> 01:30:06.42 But when called upon to march, they march and when called upon to fight.
01:30:06.42 --> 01:30:10.66 They fight and when called upon to rise up and overcome.
01:30:10.66 --> 01:30:22.26 They do just that they rise up and overcome.
01:30:22.26 --> 01:30:33.78 And that shows us that we can do the same thing in the challenges that we face.
01:30:33.78 --> 01:30:39.26 We can do the same thing.
01:30:39.26 --> 01:30:47.02 And overcome.
01:30:47.02 --> 01:30:55.42 And I think that's all I've got for tonight's so echo.
01:30:55.42 --> 01:31:02.58 Perhaps if you could let people know how they can support themselves and maybe if they
01:31:02.58 --> 01:31:06.30 want to support this podcast as well.
01:31:06.30 --> 01:31:08.30 It's crazy how these marches.
01:31:08.30 --> 01:31:09.30 Right.
01:31:09.30 --> 01:31:10.30 Brutal.
01:31:10.30 --> 01:31:11.30 Yeah.
01:31:11.30 --> 01:31:12.30 And this is I don't know.
01:31:12.30 --> 01:31:15.30 Maybe from what I can remember the worst one.
01:31:15.30 --> 01:31:18.86 Especially I'll be talking about with no shoes.
01:31:18.86 --> 01:31:22.18 Their shoes probably just fall off with them first, you know, little bit.
01:31:22.18 --> 01:31:26.06 And then they're walking with no shoes or barely any shoes or whatever.
01:31:26.06 --> 01:31:27.90 Crying straight up just from the march.
01:31:27.90 --> 01:31:32.14 By the way, not the, not the war or anything like that.
01:31:32.14 --> 01:31:36.38 Where the marches yet.
01:31:36.38 --> 01:31:38.50 This is big of an enemy.
01:31:38.50 --> 01:31:40.50 He said his pack was his biggest enemy.
01:31:40.50 --> 01:31:42.70 He had literally the death.
01:31:42.70 --> 01:31:45.30 The kind where guys are still killing them.
01:31:45.30 --> 01:31:48.26 Killings killing them.
01:31:48.26 --> 01:31:52.78 So we just cut back from Utah obviously.
01:31:52.78 --> 01:31:57.30 And you know, after every, we're doing that training where, you know, we brief debrief.
01:31:57.30 --> 01:31:59.02 Go down exercise brief.
01:31:59.02 --> 01:32:00.42 And then you know, we walk back and forth.
01:32:00.42 --> 01:32:01.42 Right.
01:32:01.42 --> 01:32:02.42 So, okay.
01:32:02.42 --> 01:32:03.42 So, echo.
01:32:03.42 --> 01:32:05.14 I'll just tell people have no idea what you're talking about.
01:32:05.14 --> 01:32:06.42 So, I'll just find echo.
01:32:06.42 --> 01:32:12.26 We just got echelon front, did a FTX field training exercise with the company.
01:32:12.26 --> 01:32:13.42 We were in Utah.
01:32:13.42 --> 01:32:17.46 We brought echo out so that he could get some footage and whatnot.
01:32:17.46 --> 01:32:19.58 And so, so that's what we're talking about.
01:32:19.58 --> 01:32:21.62 So we're in the field.
01:32:21.62 --> 01:32:28.58 We're doing basically urban and combat with a group of, let's call them regular people,
01:32:28.58 --> 01:32:35.10 business people that are learning leadership through experiential.
01:32:35.10 --> 01:32:36.10 Environments.
01:32:36.10 --> 01:32:37.10 Yeah.
01:32:37.10 --> 01:32:38.10 It's an interesting one.
01:32:38.10 --> 01:32:46.90 It's like a con, you know how, if you don't communicate with someone effectively,
01:32:46.90 --> 01:32:47.90 it's falling apart.
01:32:47.90 --> 01:32:48.90 Right.
01:32:48.90 --> 01:32:51.18 Or if you don't, you know, it's like, and that's exactly what you're going to say.
01:32:51.18 --> 01:32:53.10 And it's drawn out, stitching in life.
01:32:53.10 --> 01:32:56.46 But this is like a condensed version of that.
01:32:56.46 --> 01:32:57.46 Yes.
01:32:57.46 --> 01:33:03.30 So, if you don't communicate with someone during an FTX, you know, within like 30 seconds
01:33:03.30 --> 01:33:04.78 that something just went wrong.
01:33:04.78 --> 01:33:08.70 And now we're getting shot in the face with airsoft rifles.
01:33:08.70 --> 01:33:09.70 Yeah.
01:33:09.70 --> 01:33:10.70 It's just fun.
01:33:10.70 --> 01:33:12.70 It's really fun to watch from the outside.
01:33:12.70 --> 01:33:13.70 Yeah.
01:33:13.70 --> 01:33:14.70 Because you see it.
01:33:14.70 --> 01:33:16.82 And I've been to another one too.
01:33:16.82 --> 01:33:17.82 And yeah, you see it.
01:33:17.82 --> 01:33:20.98 And it's interesting how in the beginning it's like, it's almost impossible.
01:33:20.98 --> 01:33:21.98 Right.
01:33:21.98 --> 01:33:25.66 And immediately communication breaks down immediately.
01:33:25.66 --> 01:33:29.78 And then towards the end, you start to see people communicating, getting it.
01:33:29.78 --> 01:33:32.54 You know, like, you kind of, a lot of times you got to over communicate.
01:33:32.54 --> 01:33:33.54 Yeah, for sure.
01:33:33.54 --> 01:33:36.62 But the more you do that, the more effective it is.
01:33:36.62 --> 01:33:38.18 It's so crazy to watch.
01:33:38.18 --> 01:33:39.18 It is.
01:33:39.18 --> 01:33:41.22 And I don't know if you remember Dave saying this.
01:33:41.22 --> 01:33:42.38 Dave told them.
01:33:42.38 --> 01:33:46.74 He said, Jocco just told you the mistakes that you're going to make.
01:33:46.74 --> 01:33:49.62 You told you what you're going to do.
01:33:49.62 --> 01:33:51.26 And you're going to do it.
01:33:51.26 --> 01:33:53.86 And then sure enough, and we're missing the one of them.
01:33:53.86 --> 01:33:58.90 The funniest was the one individual that said they came up with a plan for something.
01:33:58.90 --> 01:34:02.26 And we said, you know, you're risking to get a blue on blue on blue there.
01:34:02.26 --> 01:34:06.90 And she said, she said, listen, I understand what you're saying.
01:34:06.90 --> 01:34:10.02 But it's not like we're going to walk in there and start shooting each other.
01:34:10.02 --> 01:34:11.02 Yeah.
01:34:11.02 --> 01:34:12.02 That's not going to happen.
01:34:12.02 --> 01:34:16.14 And and sure enough, that very girl was in a stressful situation.
01:34:16.14 --> 01:34:19.06 And they ended a building from two different sides at the same time.
01:34:19.06 --> 01:34:24.18 And sure enough, she, she dusted one of her, one of her teammates.
01:34:24.18 --> 01:34:26.58 And it was, you know, it's one of those things.
01:34:26.58 --> 01:34:27.58 Yeah.
01:34:27.58 --> 01:34:28.94 I said, remember what you said yesterday?
01:34:28.94 --> 01:34:29.94 She said, yeah.
01:34:29.94 --> 01:34:30.94 Oh, yeah, I remember.
01:34:30.94 --> 01:34:34.98 So just in, and I had the luxury of seeing it from the outside.
01:34:34.98 --> 01:34:35.98 Oh, yeah.
01:34:35.98 --> 01:34:36.98 So you can feel it though.
01:34:36.98 --> 01:34:37.98 Oh, yeah.
01:34:37.98 --> 01:34:41.98 But you're in a different situation position than me.
01:34:41.98 --> 01:34:48.82 Anyway, the point is, so the terrain there was where the field and where you actually
01:34:48.82 --> 01:34:52.82 do that that field training part of it is like, well, what would you say?
01:34:52.82 --> 01:34:53.82 What?
01:34:53.82 --> 01:34:56.98 Just do a hundred yards away from the where you do the brief and debrief.
01:34:56.98 --> 01:34:58.26 It is about 400 yards.
01:34:58.26 --> 01:34:59.26 Yeah.
01:34:59.26 --> 01:35:00.26 So it's a little bit of a track.
01:35:00.26 --> 01:35:01.26 300 yards.
01:35:01.26 --> 01:35:03.26 If you're doing it again and again, multiple times.
01:35:03.26 --> 01:35:12.34 So you're going brief exercise, debrief, brief exit, you know, so kind of all day, really.
01:35:12.34 --> 01:35:17.54 So, and this was a situation where there was a hill and rocky, you know, hill.
01:35:17.54 --> 01:35:19.98 So I'm walking right now, my camera the whole time.
01:35:19.98 --> 01:35:24.94 And it's not slay to the my other camera, but, you know, it's something.
01:35:24.94 --> 01:35:28.82 And so I'm walking back and forth all day, all day, where my feet are starting to get
01:35:28.82 --> 01:35:29.82 like kind of tired.
01:35:29.82 --> 01:35:36.14 And I'm thinking every single time though, every single time I'm thinking, this is nothing.
01:35:36.14 --> 01:35:39.50 Compared to what you guys really do.
01:35:39.50 --> 01:35:40.50 Yeah.
01:35:40.50 --> 01:35:41.62 You know how nothing it was?
01:35:41.62 --> 01:35:45.74 I didn't that thought didn't even go across my mind at all in any way, shape or something.
01:35:45.74 --> 01:35:49.14 You know what I'm saying about that is while I'm walking, this was like, after lunch
01:35:49.14 --> 01:35:50.14 time.
01:35:50.14 --> 01:35:52.66 I'm thinking, and I'm seeing you guys and everyone's cruising and I'm thinking, is everyone
01:35:52.66 --> 01:35:55.26 trying to act like this isn't like kind of kind of terrain?
01:35:55.26 --> 01:35:58.10 I literally didn't think of it until you said this to me right now.
01:35:58.10 --> 01:36:01.30 Yeah, the biggest, I was totally acting like, well, there's nothing.
01:36:01.30 --> 01:36:02.30 No, I wasn't going to.
01:36:02.30 --> 01:36:05.10 I was going to, I, yeah, brother, I had a lot of stuff.
01:36:05.10 --> 01:36:06.10 Yeah, and it helps.
01:36:06.10 --> 01:36:07.10 Yeah, it does.
01:36:07.10 --> 01:36:12.90 But the fact is, do you do actually better when you pretend that it doesn't bother you?
01:36:12.90 --> 01:36:13.90 Yes, that's right.
01:36:13.90 --> 01:36:17.46 Yeah, we're going to remember that night in the night in the, so we started acting
01:36:17.46 --> 01:36:20.02 all tired, accepting, showing everyone.
01:36:20.02 --> 01:36:22.46 Yeah, it's true.
01:36:22.46 --> 01:36:25.14 But nonetheless, the fact is, it wasn't nothing.
01:36:25.14 --> 01:36:26.14 It wasn't nothing.
01:36:26.14 --> 01:36:30.18 It felt it, and, you know, so I'm just funny.
01:36:30.18 --> 01:36:34.62 I'm looking at you guys something like, hey, I wonder if these guys are, you know, but
01:36:34.62 --> 01:36:35.62 no one said anything.
01:36:35.62 --> 01:36:38.90 No, nobody said dang, these tracks are getting long.
01:36:38.90 --> 01:36:40.70 That's because they were 300 meters, bro.
01:36:40.70 --> 01:36:44.58 I feel like they're just saying.
01:36:44.58 --> 01:36:51.22 But nonetheless, so every time I feel anything like that, I think of like, you guys first
01:36:51.22 --> 01:36:56.10 and you guys are doing it in like crazy heat too, gear and like all this stuff.
01:36:56.10 --> 01:36:58.54 And I think of this kind guys, these kind guys.
01:36:58.54 --> 01:36:59.54 Yeah.
01:36:59.54 --> 01:37:00.54 Right from inheritance.
01:37:00.54 --> 01:37:01.54 The right from inheritance.
01:37:01.54 --> 01:37:06.58 Feet all tore up, starving, starving.
01:37:06.58 --> 01:37:07.58 Starving.
01:37:07.58 --> 01:37:08.58 No sleep.
01:37:08.58 --> 01:37:09.58 No water.
01:37:09.58 --> 01:37:10.58 No water.
01:37:10.58 --> 01:37:11.58 And people are trying to kill you.
01:37:11.58 --> 01:37:12.58 Oh yeah, yeah.
01:37:12.58 --> 01:37:13.58 So that's the point, man.
01:37:13.58 --> 01:37:14.58 Yeah.
01:37:14.58 --> 01:37:19.02 Because if these guys can rise and overcome that, then what, figure your personal potential.
01:37:19.02 --> 01:37:20.02 Yeah.
01:37:20.02 --> 01:37:21.02 Right?
01:37:21.02 --> 01:37:22.02 Yeah.
01:37:22.02 --> 01:37:23.02 Think of it.
01:37:23.02 --> 01:37:24.02 Think of what more you could do.
01:37:24.02 --> 01:37:25.02 Yeah.
01:37:25.02 --> 01:37:27.02 I've got to look and bother some of your guys.
01:37:27.02 --> 01:37:28.02 Yeah, that looked like that.
01:37:28.02 --> 01:37:30.02 You're like, I made some dope videos though.
01:37:30.02 --> 01:37:33.94 We're about to make a huge excuse right now too.
01:37:33.94 --> 01:37:39.82 Which I don't even know if it's an excuse, but it's a factor where these like hard actual
01:37:39.82 --> 01:37:45.46 hard times kind of call on you to exercise this kind of will.
01:37:45.46 --> 01:37:49.22 And I think a lot of times we're not like hard times don't call on us.
01:37:49.22 --> 01:37:50.22 Like this anyway.
01:37:50.22 --> 01:37:51.78 I mean, hard times do, you know.
01:37:51.78 --> 01:37:55.42 But you know what though?
01:37:55.42 --> 01:38:01.74 You should, I mean, technically and potentially you should be able to exercise as much
01:38:01.74 --> 01:38:03.38 will as it takes.
01:38:03.38 --> 01:38:04.38 Really?
01:38:04.38 --> 01:38:06.02 Now when you consider kind of the limits.
01:38:06.02 --> 01:38:07.02 Right?
01:38:07.02 --> 01:38:08.02 Because these are the limits.
01:38:08.02 --> 01:38:09.02 These are the limits.
01:38:09.02 --> 01:38:12.42 This is one of the stories where the guys like I'm done.
01:38:12.42 --> 01:38:13.42 Yeah.
01:38:13.42 --> 01:38:14.42 He's a little bit more.
01:38:14.42 --> 01:38:15.42 I'm done.
01:38:15.42 --> 01:38:16.62 Guys are saying, hey, if you stay here, you're going to die.
01:38:16.62 --> 01:38:18.42 He's like, yeah, I cannot move anymore.
01:38:18.42 --> 01:38:19.42 No.
01:38:19.42 --> 01:38:24.90 You know, what point are you at when you cannot save your own life by walking?
01:38:24.90 --> 01:38:25.90 You can't walk.
01:38:25.90 --> 01:38:28.58 You can't take another step.
01:38:28.58 --> 01:38:30.54 And he came back from that.
01:38:30.54 --> 01:38:31.54 Yeah.
01:38:31.54 --> 01:38:32.54 Jay.
01:38:32.54 --> 01:38:33.54 Yeah.
01:38:33.54 --> 01:38:36.54 And they told really good job in illustrating it.
01:38:36.54 --> 01:38:41.78 Because you, or talking about it, where, because he mentioned the no shoes thing a few
01:38:41.78 --> 01:38:42.78 times.
01:38:42.78 --> 01:38:43.78 Yeah.
01:38:43.78 --> 01:38:44.78 He did.
01:38:44.78 --> 01:38:46.46 But again, I bet if, yeah.
01:38:46.46 --> 01:38:47.46 Yeah.
01:38:47.46 --> 01:38:50.22 He does a great job.
01:38:50.22 --> 01:38:57.26 But you can't even begin to, yeah, you can't even begin to really get the point across.
01:38:57.26 --> 01:38:58.26 Yeah.
01:38:58.26 --> 01:38:59.26 The way it is.
01:38:59.26 --> 01:39:03.18 As the leader, I was talking to a guy the other day.
01:39:03.18 --> 01:39:06.14 That went to Buds and didn't make it through.
01:39:06.14 --> 01:39:08.82 And I know them for a while.
01:39:08.82 --> 01:39:13.34 And I just said, like, hey, man, you know, you're a good dude.
01:39:13.34 --> 01:39:14.98 You know, what?
01:39:14.98 --> 01:39:15.98 Why did you?
01:39:15.98 --> 01:39:17.38 Why did you quit?
01:39:17.38 --> 01:39:18.22 And he said, you know what?
01:39:18.22 --> 01:39:19.90 It just sucked.
01:39:19.90 --> 01:39:22.66 And I was like, okay, but didn't you know it was going to suck?
01:39:22.66 --> 01:39:25.66 And he said, yeah, I knew it was going to suck.
01:39:25.66 --> 01:39:30.78 But at the same time, you know, I watched on TV and I thought to myself, okay, yeah,
01:39:30.78 --> 01:39:31.62 that's going to suck.
01:39:31.62 --> 01:39:35.90 He said, so I thought I understood how it was going to suck.
01:39:35.90 --> 01:39:37.34 But I didn't understand how it was going to suck.
01:39:37.34 --> 01:39:38.34 And then I was there.
01:39:38.34 --> 01:39:39.34 I said, this really sucks.
01:39:39.34 --> 01:39:40.34 And he quit.
01:39:40.34 --> 01:39:46.02 And again, a good dude that, that I'm kind of, you know, thinking myself, why?
01:39:46.02 --> 01:39:49.14 I'm trying to figure out why people quit.
01:39:49.14 --> 01:39:50.30 And that was what he said.
01:39:50.30 --> 01:39:53.94 He said much like we're saying, because much of you could imagine.
01:39:53.94 --> 01:39:55.58 And you think you're self-alman.
01:39:55.58 --> 01:39:56.58 Yeah.
01:39:56.58 --> 01:39:58.66 But I think I could make that one more step.
01:39:58.66 --> 01:39:59.66 You don't know.
01:39:59.66 --> 01:40:00.66 You're known to you.
01:40:00.66 --> 01:40:01.66 You've been dehydrated.
01:40:01.66 --> 01:40:07.06 Having people trying to shoot you, cleaning up your buddies brains off your jacket
01:40:07.06 --> 01:40:09.38 for weeks, months on end.
01:40:09.38 --> 01:40:10.38 Your dehydrated.
01:40:10.38 --> 01:40:13.94 And now you have no shoes, no stockings.
01:40:13.94 --> 01:40:20.06 And you're doing a forced march on this road for this, but they march four days without
01:40:20.06 --> 01:40:21.38 stopping.
01:40:21.38 --> 01:40:22.38 What even is that?
01:40:22.38 --> 01:40:23.86 No, no, no, dang.
01:40:23.86 --> 01:40:24.86 Yeah.
01:40:24.86 --> 01:40:25.86 Yeah.
01:40:25.86 --> 01:40:26.86 That's it.
01:40:26.86 --> 01:40:30.26 I mean, you.
01:40:30.26 --> 01:40:34.86 This kind of, that's not to mention like, no medical care.
01:40:34.86 --> 01:40:35.86 No.
01:40:35.86 --> 01:40:37.26 No one's coming to save you.
01:40:37.26 --> 01:40:38.26 You know what?
01:40:38.26 --> 01:40:39.26 You know what?
01:40:39.26 --> 01:40:40.26 You know what?
01:40:40.26 --> 01:40:44.38 If you have an ingrown toenail.
01:40:44.38 --> 01:40:49.82 Right, right, like, like, a little thing that is Bob, it actually bothers you in actual life.
01:40:49.82 --> 01:40:50.82 Yeah.
01:40:50.82 --> 01:40:53.94 Think if you had that here, or you have a, or you have, let's say you got a spring
01:40:53.94 --> 01:40:54.94 ankle.
01:40:54.94 --> 01:40:56.82 A bad spring ankle.
01:40:56.82 --> 01:40:58.78 I spray my ankle really bad before.
01:40:58.78 --> 01:40:59.78 Sure.
01:40:59.78 --> 01:41:01.30 You can't walk on it.
01:41:01.30 --> 01:41:02.70 Well, now you don't have a choice.
01:41:02.70 --> 01:41:04.58 You either walk on it or you die.
01:41:04.58 --> 01:41:09.38 I think about the little things that are that caused you an inconvenience right now.
01:41:09.38 --> 01:41:13.34 I think about what an inconvenience that is in this situation.
01:41:13.34 --> 01:41:17.10 Think about your little infection and your fingers, you know, your finger, you're, you've
01:41:17.10 --> 01:41:21.30 ever had one of those little stupid, like, where your fingernails get a little infection
01:41:21.30 --> 01:41:22.30 there?
01:41:22.30 --> 01:41:23.30 Yeah, yeah.
01:41:23.30 --> 01:41:24.30 Think about that.
01:41:24.30 --> 01:41:25.30 And that you don't have no medicine.
01:41:25.30 --> 01:41:27.06 You don't have any way of, yeah, that's the things you're going to turn into
01:41:27.06 --> 01:41:28.70 in giant infection.
01:41:28.70 --> 01:41:29.70 Yeah.
01:41:29.70 --> 01:41:30.70 You die.
01:41:30.70 --> 01:41:36.70 This is the little, little tiny things that annoy you are, will kill you back in the
01:41:36.70 --> 01:41:37.70 day.
01:41:37.70 --> 01:41:38.70 Yeah.
01:41:38.70 --> 01:41:39.70 Check.
01:41:39.70 --> 01:41:40.70 Yeah.
01:41:40.70 --> 01:41:42.34 So what we have to do is prepare for these hard times.
01:41:42.34 --> 01:41:45.94 Do you have any advice on how we could help prepare ourselves for these hard times?
01:41:45.94 --> 01:41:52.46 On top of referencing these scenarios.
01:41:52.46 --> 01:41:53.86 I reference your guys scenario.
01:41:53.86 --> 01:41:59.18 Like, basically, everything that you guys tell me and talk about, like, how it's super hot.
01:41:59.18 --> 01:42:00.82 How you don't sleep as much.
01:42:00.82 --> 01:42:03.18 I'm not talking about bad and talking about, like, Ian Ramadi.
01:42:03.18 --> 01:42:04.18 I call these up.
01:42:04.18 --> 01:42:06.46 I kind of imagine that helps.
01:42:06.46 --> 01:42:07.46 It's coldly helps.
01:42:07.46 --> 01:42:08.46 That's good.
01:42:08.46 --> 01:42:10.70 Because it helps me to think about right from the Harris.
01:42:10.70 --> 01:42:11.70 Yeah.
01:42:11.70 --> 01:42:12.70 Don't.
01:42:12.70 --> 01:42:13.70 For sure.
01:42:13.70 --> 01:42:15.70 And to speak in a help.
01:42:15.70 --> 01:42:17.70 Speaking of helping yourself.
01:42:17.70 --> 01:42:18.70 All right.
01:42:18.70 --> 01:42:23.26 So you're, in a way, this is kind of a dichotomy here.
01:42:23.26 --> 01:42:25.10 Because you don't like when you're joined to get sore.
01:42:25.10 --> 01:42:26.10 I'm talking about cruel.
01:42:26.10 --> 01:42:29.82 I want to hear a fair real quick.
01:42:29.82 --> 01:42:31.90 That you can be a self-pream luxury.
01:42:31.90 --> 01:42:32.90 Yeah.
01:42:32.90 --> 01:42:33.90 You're right from the Harris, you know.
01:42:33.90 --> 01:42:34.90 Yeah.
01:42:34.90 --> 01:42:36.90 So, Joy-Wiffer, who knows?
01:42:36.90 --> 01:42:37.90 I have no thumbs.
01:42:37.90 --> 01:42:39.34 I'm pretty sure it may be wouldn't stop that day.
01:42:39.34 --> 01:42:40.34 That time.
01:42:40.34 --> 01:42:41.34 It's a pretty luxury.
01:42:41.34 --> 01:42:42.34 Yeah.
01:42:42.34 --> 01:42:43.34 Supreme luxury.
01:42:43.34 --> 01:42:45.66 Where now it's like, hey, my joints.
01:42:45.66 --> 01:42:46.66 I'm getting older.
01:42:46.66 --> 01:42:47.66 My joints kind of hurt.
01:42:47.66 --> 01:42:48.66 I can't.
01:42:48.66 --> 01:42:51.54 I can't work out at the gym.
01:42:51.54 --> 01:42:54.02 You know, at my leisure.
01:42:54.02 --> 01:42:56.90 As good, let me take some joint warfare.
01:42:56.90 --> 01:43:00.70 You know, improve my comfort while I work out.
01:43:00.70 --> 01:43:01.70 Function for sure.
01:43:01.70 --> 01:43:02.70 Function.
01:43:02.70 --> 01:43:04.54 But comfort has a lot to do with it.
01:43:04.54 --> 01:43:07.98 You know, with sore joints is way less comfortable than not sore joint.
01:43:07.98 --> 01:43:08.98 Yeah.
01:43:08.98 --> 01:43:12.78 I'm going to say though, there's exercises that you cannot do when you're doing
01:43:12.78 --> 01:43:14.42 it right at your rock and roll.
01:43:14.42 --> 01:43:15.42 Yeah.
01:43:15.42 --> 01:43:20.10 So, you can push yourself harder and be better prepared for the hard times if you're
01:43:20.10 --> 01:43:21.10 working correctly.
01:43:21.10 --> 01:43:22.90 If your joints are working correctly.
01:43:22.90 --> 01:43:23.90 Yeah.
01:43:23.90 --> 01:43:24.90 That's a dichotomy.
01:43:24.90 --> 01:43:29.46 And there also is no like concession.
01:43:29.46 --> 01:43:34.46 There's no reason to say, hey, my joints being less
01:43:34.46 --> 01:43:36.94 healthy is a good is fine.
01:43:36.94 --> 01:43:37.94 Is good.
01:43:37.94 --> 01:43:38.94 That's a good thing.
01:43:38.94 --> 01:43:40.26 You know, so you have a choice.
01:43:40.26 --> 01:43:44.62 Should I maintain or improve the joint?
01:43:44.62 --> 01:43:50.66 My joint health of my body, including but not limited to joints or should I not?
01:43:50.66 --> 01:43:52.02 The decision should never be.
01:43:52.02 --> 01:43:53.02 I'm not.
01:43:53.02 --> 01:43:54.02 Never be.
01:43:54.02 --> 01:43:55.86 I think that's what's my opinion.
01:43:55.86 --> 01:44:00.26 Anyway, so the point is so jocquism supplements.
01:44:00.26 --> 01:44:01.26 Joint.
01:44:01.26 --> 01:44:02.26 So it's for your joints.
01:44:02.26 --> 01:44:08.70 It's best kind of supplements as someone with a level head now is for a supplements
01:44:08.70 --> 01:44:09.70 goes.
01:44:09.70 --> 01:44:10.70 Go.
01:44:10.70 --> 01:44:14.38 I think the joint for your joints.
01:44:14.38 --> 01:44:18.26 You know, bones.
01:44:18.26 --> 01:44:20.30 Maybe stuff that's going to be stronger.
01:44:20.30 --> 01:44:21.30 Structural.
01:44:21.30 --> 01:44:22.30 Yeah.
01:44:22.30 --> 01:44:23.30 Structural support.
01:44:23.30 --> 01:44:28.38 Because again, and I said, it's like if you're going for a cool protein
01:44:28.38 --> 01:44:31.06 powder, a lot of people that say, hey, what's a good protein powder?
01:44:31.06 --> 01:44:32.62 Because I think you don't stake.
01:44:32.62 --> 01:44:38.78 Like how much protein do you like not get to need supplemental protein?
01:44:38.78 --> 01:44:42.90 Well, people know, people want that because it's getting the convenience.
01:44:42.90 --> 01:44:44.54 That's why people like those.
01:44:44.54 --> 01:44:49.98 I'm going to make one that's going to be both convenient and tasty and good.
01:44:49.98 --> 01:44:50.98 All right.
01:44:50.98 --> 01:44:52.34 There you go.
01:44:52.34 --> 01:44:53.82 Nonetheless, that's cool.
01:44:53.82 --> 01:44:55.22 I'm not saying that's a bad thing.
01:44:55.22 --> 01:45:01.02 I'm saying as far as like the importance of focusing on a supplement, the most benefit
01:45:01.02 --> 01:45:05.06 is that you're spending your convenience that really.
01:45:05.06 --> 01:45:06.06 For sure.
01:45:06.06 --> 01:45:07.06 That supplementing protein.
01:45:07.06 --> 01:45:08.06 You're supplementing convenience.
01:45:08.06 --> 01:45:09.06 Nothing wrong with that.
01:45:09.06 --> 01:45:10.06 Nothing wrong with that.
01:45:10.06 --> 01:45:11.06 We got a lot to do.
01:45:11.06 --> 01:45:12.06 I understand.
01:45:12.06 --> 01:45:16.42 But as far as like the what do you call it, the hierarchy of supplements.
01:45:16.42 --> 01:45:17.94 You're in the same change.
01:45:17.94 --> 01:45:18.94 Jordan B. Peter's in supplements.
01:45:18.94 --> 01:45:19.94 You're in the house.
01:45:19.94 --> 01:45:23.06 The dominant hierarchy of supplements.
01:45:23.06 --> 01:45:24.06 The the drill oil.
01:45:24.06 --> 01:45:25.06 Omega threes.
01:45:25.06 --> 01:45:29.74 Like these kinds of things that help you directly.
01:45:29.74 --> 01:45:30.98 That's the main one.
01:45:30.98 --> 01:45:31.98 Anyway.
01:45:31.98 --> 01:45:34.98 So your point in all this is.
01:45:34.98 --> 01:45:36.38 Just a supplement.
01:45:36.38 --> 01:45:39.38 Legit supplements.
01:45:39.38 --> 01:45:41.22 Super krill oil.
01:45:41.22 --> 01:45:42.38 Jocco super krill is what's called.
01:45:42.38 --> 01:45:47.70 It's krill oil for you joints and join warfare.
01:45:47.70 --> 01:45:49.26 Where do you get them?
01:45:49.26 --> 01:45:50.26 Origin main dot com.
01:45:50.26 --> 01:45:51.26 Okay.
01:45:51.26 --> 01:45:52.26 Thank you.
01:45:52.26 --> 01:45:54.26 Brown, I'm telling you, I feel like.
01:45:54.26 --> 01:45:56.70 Your drawing this out way too much.
01:45:56.70 --> 01:46:01.62 If I was doing this to be like, if you want to have good healthy joints, get some
01:46:01.62 --> 01:46:08.22 krill oil, super krill and get some joint warfare from originmain.com, M.A.I.N.E.
01:46:08.22 --> 01:46:09.22 Yeah.
01:46:09.22 --> 01:46:10.22 But, and then we'd be good.
01:46:10.22 --> 01:46:11.22 We'd be moving on the next thing.
01:46:11.22 --> 01:46:12.22 Yeah, no, I dig it.
01:46:12.22 --> 01:46:14.42 And I want to read the time at the hierarchy.
01:46:14.42 --> 01:46:15.42 Here's the thing.
01:46:15.42 --> 01:46:16.42 The dominant number.
01:46:16.42 --> 01:46:19.46 No, it's a little bit like, remember, and this makes sense.
01:46:19.46 --> 01:46:20.46 This is relevant.
01:46:20.46 --> 01:46:21.46 Your get all serious with me.
01:46:21.46 --> 01:46:22.46 It's not going to prove you point.
01:46:22.46 --> 01:46:23.46 Because you're not doing it.
01:46:23.46 --> 01:46:24.46 I'm going to prove it because I'm not.
01:46:24.46 --> 01:46:25.46 I'm going to prove it because I'm not.
01:46:25.46 --> 01:46:26.98 Because back out of your element out of your.
01:46:26.98 --> 01:46:32.10 Again, again, when I was, we'll say 23.
01:46:32.10 --> 01:46:35.78 I don't know, take some fos for something.
01:46:35.78 --> 01:46:36.78 Yeah, yeah.
01:46:36.78 --> 01:46:37.78 I just got stuff.
01:46:37.78 --> 01:46:38.78 Yeah.
01:46:38.78 --> 01:46:39.78 Yeah.
01:46:39.78 --> 01:46:45.26 So what if someone, listening, or group people listening, who have that same mindset,
01:46:45.26 --> 01:46:48.02 and it's not because not because I knew both things.
01:46:48.02 --> 01:46:50.02 And I would just, I just didn't know.
01:46:50.02 --> 01:46:51.02 OK.
01:46:51.02 --> 01:46:52.06 So I'm going to say, now, so now we know.
01:46:52.06 --> 01:46:52.86 Yeah, well, that's good.
01:46:52.86 --> 01:46:55.38 If there's someone that doesn't know that, maybe they turn this off.
01:46:55.38 --> 01:46:56.38 Like eight minutes ago.
01:46:56.38 --> 01:46:59.54 Maybe maybe not four, maybe they're more educated now, and maybe boom.
01:46:59.54 --> 01:47:02.14 They're now they're looking into the joint situation.
01:47:02.14 --> 01:47:03.54 That's what I think is happening.
01:47:03.54 --> 01:47:04.54 That's my opinion.
01:47:04.54 --> 01:47:05.54 Hey, care.
01:47:05.54 --> 01:47:06.54 That's my prediction.
01:47:06.54 --> 01:47:08.22 I'm sure Twitter will let us know.
01:47:08.22 --> 01:47:11.46 Anyway, the origin main.com on the top.

01:47:24.86 --> 01:47:25.86 I don't think I should get it.
01:47:25.86 --> 01:47:26.86 I started to do this.
01:47:26.86 --> 01:47:27.86 What geys should I get?
01:47:27.86 --> 01:47:28.86 We know now.

01:47:33.74 --> 01:47:35.74 Planted harvested process.
01:47:35.74 --> 01:47:38.10 That's pretty much the seeds did do.
01:47:38.10 --> 01:47:39.10 The seeds.
01:47:39.10 --> 01:47:40.10 Yeah.
01:47:40.10 --> 01:47:44.90 Well, that's an exciting thing.
01:47:44.90 --> 01:47:45.90 I'm just saying.

01:52:52.04 --> 01:52:55.04 People can't absorb it all the first time around.
01:52:55.04 --> 01:52:56.04 Yeah.
01:52:56.04 --> 01:52:57.04 Wait, what do you mean?

01:52:59.04 --> 01:53:01.04 What was on episode 63?
01:53:01.04 --> 01:53:02.04 Right?
01:53:02.04 --> 01:53:04.04 People would people don't remember that thing.
01:53:04.04 --> 01:53:05.04 Maybe.
01:53:05.04 --> 01:53:07.04 So you just like to get to you go listen.
01:53:07.04 --> 01:53:08.04 You learn it again.
01:53:08.04 --> 01:53:09.04 And now it's more recognizable.
01:53:09.04 --> 01:53:10.04 Yeah.
01:53:10.04 --> 01:53:12.04 So it's like drilling a little bit.
01:53:12.04 --> 01:53:13.04 Yeah.
01:53:13.04 --> 01:53:14.04 No, I'm going to come back.
01:53:14.04 --> 01:53:15.04 I'm going to drill so far.
01:53:15.04 --> 01:53:16.04 Yeah.
01:53:16.04 --> 01:53:19.04 And something, you know how like certain things just apply to you more.
01:53:19.04 --> 01:53:21.04 Like if you're, you're advice on, I don't know,
01:53:21.04 --> 01:53:24.04 college that's easy when you remember about how to approach college.
01:53:24.04 --> 01:53:25.04 Right?
01:53:25.04 --> 01:53:26.04 Crash college or whatever.
01:53:26.04 --> 01:53:29.04 It's going to apply to me more if I'm actually in college.
01:53:29.04 --> 01:53:30.04 Yeah.
01:53:30.04 --> 01:53:32.04 Let's just apply that to other things in life.
01:53:32.04 --> 01:53:33.04 Which you can easily do.
01:53:33.04 --> 01:53:34.04 You can.
01:53:34.04 --> 01:53:35.04 For sure.
01:53:35.04 --> 01:53:36.04 But that's going to apply to me directly.
01:53:36.04 --> 01:53:37.04 We'll say.
01:53:37.04 --> 01:53:39.04 You know, more than maybe the next guy.
01:53:39.04 --> 01:53:42.04 So that kind of stuff where.
01:53:42.04 --> 01:53:44.04 That one I want to remember.
01:53:44.04 --> 01:53:45.04 Okay.
01:53:45.04 --> 01:53:46.04 I'm going to come back to that one.
01:53:46.04 --> 01:53:50.04 If I can constantly remind myself of the things that directly apply to me,
01:53:50.04 --> 01:53:55.04 you can be more, it's going to be more beneficial rather than just listening to all the podcast and hoping you remember each one.
01:53:55.04 --> 01:53:56.04 Nonetheless.
01:53:56.04 --> 01:54:00.04 Point there is that's that's a good reason to subscribe to the YouTube channel.
01:54:00.04 --> 01:54:07.04 So if you, in fact, if the excerpts or some excerpts resonate with you.
01:54:07.04 --> 01:54:10.04 You got him there. You fingertips and you can share.

01:54:23.04 --> 01:54:24.04 Of course they do.
01:54:24.04 --> 01:54:25.04 Do you think so?
01:54:25.04 --> 01:54:27.04 I think that's common language.
01:54:27.04 --> 01:54:28.04 No.
01:54:28.04 --> 01:54:28.04 Actually, no.
01:54:28.04 --> 01:54:29.04 I think you're right.
01:54:29.04 --> 01:54:30.04 You're actually called a website.
01:54:30.04 --> 01:54:30.04 Website.
01:54:30.04 --> 01:54:31.04 Yeah. The website.
01:54:31.04 --> 01:54:33.04 What is your URL stand for?
01:54:33.04 --> 01:54:34.04 See, well, I don't even know.
01:54:34.04 --> 01:54:35.04 See.
01:54:35.04 --> 01:54:37.04 You better forgot.
01:54:37.04 --> 01:54:39.04 No, I'm actually not a tech guy.
01:54:39.04 --> 01:54:41.04 Yeah, but you knew I was a little old man.
01:54:41.04 --> 01:54:43.04 I knew what it meant.
01:54:43.04 --> 01:54:45.04 I don't know what it stands for.
01:54:45.04 --> 01:54:47.04 You know, I don't know.
01:54:47.04 --> 01:54:48.04 Universal something?
01:54:48.04 --> 01:54:49.04 Ask your brother.
01:54:49.04 --> 01:54:50.04 I know.
01:54:50.04 --> 01:54:52.04 It's probably not even universal.
01:54:52.04 --> 01:54:53.04 J-trolls.
01:54:53.04 --> 01:54:55.04 Nonetheless, it's Jocquoise.
01:54:55.04 --> 01:54:58.04 The website is jocquoisestore.com.
01:54:58.04 --> 01:54:59.04 I know.
01:54:59.04 --> 01:55:00.04 Not that creative.
01:55:00.04 --> 01:55:02.04 But, easy to remember.
01:55:02.04 --> 01:55:04.04 That's where you can get the shirts.
01:55:04.04 --> 01:55:08.04 Hoodies, rashguards, compression, rashguards, if you will.
01:55:08.04 --> 01:55:12.04 We're very sectivities where you maintain your range of motion.
01:55:12.04 --> 01:55:17.04 J-tjutsu specifically in my opinion.
01:55:17.04 --> 01:55:19.04 Hoodies on their hoodies.
01:55:19.04 --> 01:55:20.04 All the hoodies.
01:55:20.04 --> 01:55:22.04 They're the same design, but though they're the heavy ones.
01:55:22.04 --> 01:55:24.04 People ask me and ask me, like, are these the heavy ones?
01:55:24.04 --> 01:55:25.04 Or where's the heavy hoodies?
01:55:25.04 --> 01:55:26.04 Well, the the heavy ones.
01:55:26.04 --> 01:55:27.04 The heavy ones.
01:55:27.04 --> 01:55:29.04 We saw like the non heavy ones.
01:55:29.04 --> 01:55:30.04 We'll call them.
01:55:30.04 --> 01:55:31.04 I thought they were heavy.
01:55:31.04 --> 01:55:32.04 Yeah.
01:55:32.04 --> 01:55:33.04 The first kind of iteration.
01:55:33.04 --> 01:55:33.04 Exactly.
01:55:33.04 --> 01:55:34.04 Where?
01:55:34.04 --> 01:55:37.04 Those were all sold out.
01:55:37.04 --> 01:55:39.04 They sold out last year.
01:55:39.04 --> 01:55:40.04 Yeah.
01:55:40.04 --> 01:55:45.04 And so I did another iteration with your request for the heavy.
01:55:45.04 --> 01:55:46.04 There they have the one.
01:55:46.04 --> 01:55:50.04 Actually, I think there might be some industrial heavier ones.
01:55:50.04 --> 01:55:51.04 Maybe.
01:55:51.04 --> 01:55:54.04 No, because I think that was.
01:55:54.04 --> 01:55:55.04 Then yeah, I don't know.
01:55:55.04 --> 01:55:57.04 I forget nonetheless.
01:55:57.04 --> 01:55:59.04 These are the heavy ones.
01:55:59.04 --> 01:56:01.04 Confirm, double confirm.
01:56:01.04 --> 01:56:03.04 Also, so women's stuff on there.
01:56:03.04 --> 01:56:09.04 I think I'm going to add a few things before Christmas on the store.
01:56:09.04 --> 01:56:10.04 That'd be good.
01:56:10.04 --> 01:56:15.04 So if you want to keep your eyes on that, that's a good way to support.
01:56:15.04 --> 01:56:17.04 If you want something, get something.
01:56:17.04 --> 01:56:18.04 Check them out.
01:56:18.04 --> 01:56:19.04 Also, psychological warfare.
01:56:19.04 --> 01:56:22.04 If you know what that is, I'm telling you it's an album with tracks.
01:56:22.04 --> 01:56:26.04 Jockel talking on these tracks.
01:56:26.04 --> 01:56:32.04 Basically, you listen to them when you are on the path.
01:56:32.04 --> 01:56:34.04 We'll say on the path.
01:56:34.04 --> 01:56:36.04 And you get moments of weakness.
01:56:36.04 --> 01:56:37.04 Days of weakness.
01:56:37.04 --> 01:56:39.04 You're not feeling like it.
01:56:39.04 --> 01:56:41.04 You know how you always talk about it.
01:56:41.04 --> 01:56:42.04 It doesn't matter if you feel like it or not.
01:56:42.04 --> 01:56:43.04 You just do it.
01:56:43.04 --> 01:56:44.04 Yeah.
01:56:44.04 --> 01:56:45.04 Okay.
01:56:45.04 --> 01:56:46.04 And I respect that.
01:56:46.04 --> 01:56:48.04 And that's where we all want to be.
01:56:48.04 --> 01:56:51.04 We all want to be there.
01:56:51.04 --> 01:56:55.04 But for some of us, it's not like that.
01:56:55.04 --> 01:56:56.04 You're a separate set of the time.
01:56:56.04 --> 01:56:58.04 Sometimes when you really don't feel like it.
01:56:58.04 --> 01:57:01.04 Sometimes when I really don't feel like it.
01:57:01.04 --> 01:57:03.04 I just don't do it, man.
01:57:03.04 --> 01:57:05.04 Sometimes they're going to be honest.
01:57:05.04 --> 01:57:07.04 We'll put on psychological warfare and you'll do it.
01:57:07.04 --> 01:57:08.04 Yes.
01:57:08.04 --> 01:57:10.04 It's like a spot.
01:57:10.04 --> 01:57:11.04 You know, especially a spot.
01:57:11.04 --> 01:57:14.04 This is where it's like a no brainer.
01:57:14.04 --> 01:57:16.04 Really easy.
01:57:16.04 --> 01:57:18.04 When you're like contemplating.
01:57:18.04 --> 01:57:21.04 I could just do this tomorrow, right?
01:57:21.04 --> 01:57:22.04 And you start making deals with yourself.
01:57:22.04 --> 01:57:23.04 You ever do that?
01:57:23.04 --> 01:57:25.04 No deals with myself.
01:57:25.04 --> 01:57:26.04 No deals with the weak part of it.
01:57:26.04 --> 01:57:27.04 It's like you don't.
01:57:27.04 --> 01:57:29.04 It's a straight up.
01:57:29.04 --> 01:57:30.04 Jockel.
01:57:30.04 --> 01:57:31.04 No deals.
01:57:31.04 --> 01:57:32.04 Jockel.
01:57:32.04 --> 01:57:33.04 Like I don't feel like it.
01:57:33.04 --> 01:57:34.04 I feel like it.
01:57:34.04 --> 01:57:35.04 Whatever.
01:57:35.04 --> 01:57:37.04 That makes me angry.
01:57:37.04 --> 01:57:39.04 I get pissed at myself.
01:57:39.04 --> 01:57:41.04 If I start leaning towards.
01:57:41.04 --> 01:57:43.04 Like, maybe I just want to do anything.
01:57:43.04 --> 01:57:44.04 No, oh, really.
01:57:44.04 --> 01:57:45.04 Really.
01:57:45.04 --> 01:57:46.04 How is that?
01:57:46.04 --> 01:57:47.04 That's how.
01:57:47.04 --> 01:57:47.04 Okay.
01:57:47.04 --> 01:57:48.04 Cool.
01:57:48.04 --> 01:57:49.04 Wanna go smash?
01:57:49.04 --> 01:57:50.04 You know, it's real funny.
01:57:50.04 --> 01:57:51.04 I would.
01:57:51.04 --> 01:57:52.04 That doesn't surprise.
01:57:52.04 --> 01:57:55.04 I'm not going to be like, I'm going to be like,
01:57:55.04 --> 01:57:58.04 I'm going to be like, I don't know if we can kind of do that.
01:57:58.04 --> 01:58:00.04 Then you get this sort of look.
01:58:00.04 --> 01:58:02.04 This kind of way about you kind of like.
01:58:02.04 --> 01:58:02.04 So wait.
01:58:02.04 --> 01:58:03.04 That's how it's.
01:58:03.04 --> 01:58:05.04 I'm going to be going on vacation.
01:58:05.04 --> 01:58:08.04 And he's going to be gone for a couple weeks.
01:58:08.04 --> 01:58:11.04 And I've been real busy with all kinds of stuff.
01:58:11.04 --> 01:58:17.04 And we were talking about if we'd be able to actually get all these podcasts done.
01:58:17.04 --> 01:58:20.04 And I didn't think we could do it.
01:58:20.04 --> 01:58:24.04 And so I said, hey, I got you know, we're just going to have to take, you know, no, no podcast for a few weeks.
01:58:24.04 --> 01:58:29.04 And then then I said, actually, like a day went by.
01:58:29.04 --> 01:58:33.04 And I said, I said, I said, echo a text that said, actually, we're going to do it.
01:58:33.04 --> 01:58:34.04 Yeah.
01:58:34.04 --> 01:58:35.04 And we're going to record all the podcasts.
01:58:35.04 --> 01:58:36.04 I'm going to prep for them all.
01:58:36.04 --> 01:58:38.04 We're going to have an all-nighter.
01:58:38.04 --> 01:58:39.04 And we'll just get it done.
01:58:39.04 --> 01:58:42.04 Bring some red bull and get some.
01:58:42.04 --> 01:58:44.04 Bring some joc a white tea.
01:58:44.04 --> 01:58:45.04 Yeah.
01:58:45.04 --> 01:58:49.04 Well, what was interesting about that is when you said that,
01:58:49.04 --> 01:58:52.04 you had this kind of tone of like dang, like,
01:58:52.04 --> 01:58:54.04 term it like we got to take a break.
01:58:54.04 --> 01:58:56.04 We got to take a break after two years, by the way,
01:58:56.04 --> 01:58:58.04 every single week, by the way.
01:59:00.04 --> 01:59:01.04 We got to take a break.
01:59:01.04 --> 01:59:02.04 That's what you said.
01:59:02.04 --> 01:59:03.04 Yeah.
01:59:03.04 --> 01:59:06.04 And right when I was like, cool, I dig it.
01:59:06.04 --> 01:59:08.04 No, I mean, I'm not saying good.
01:59:08.04 --> 01:59:09.04 I'm saying cool.
01:59:09.04 --> 01:59:10.04 I totally understand.
01:59:10.04 --> 01:59:12.04 And you know what that makes sense.
01:59:12.04 --> 01:59:14.04 HBO.
01:59:14.04 --> 01:59:16.04 Big company.
01:59:16.04 --> 01:59:18.04 Takes huge breaks.
01:59:18.04 --> 01:59:19.04 Everybody takes huge breaks.
01:59:19.04 --> 01:59:20.04 Everybody takes huge breaks.
01:59:20.04 --> 01:59:21.04 Yeah.
01:59:21.04 --> 01:59:22.04 A pair.
01:59:22.04 --> 01:59:27.04 And you're over here two years in no breaks, no breaks, no matter what.
01:59:27.04 --> 01:59:28.04 Okay.
01:59:28.04 --> 01:59:30.04 So they'll come a time when we are forced to for some reason.
01:59:30.04 --> 01:59:31.04 Yeah.
01:59:31.04 --> 01:59:32.04 That's kind of part of the point.
01:59:32.04 --> 01:59:33.04 Right?
01:59:33.04 --> 01:59:34.04 So I'm like cool.
01:59:34.04 --> 01:59:35.04 I dig it.
01:59:35.04 --> 01:59:36.04 I totally understand.
01:59:36.04 --> 01:59:37.04 Jocco.
01:59:37.04 --> 01:59:40.04 And when I said that, that's one of your face kind of shifted,
01:59:40.04 --> 01:59:43.04 like kind of you went into your own world.
01:59:43.04 --> 01:59:44.04 Like did I just say that?
01:59:44.04 --> 01:59:46.04 Like it's almost like you sort of got mad.
01:59:46.04 --> 01:59:47.04 Russel.
01:59:47.04 --> 01:59:49.04 I was like, oh, we're not taking a break.
01:59:49.04 --> 01:59:53.04 I know Jocco's gonna come back.
01:59:53.04 --> 01:59:55.04 Nonetheless, and I'm sure that'll, okay.
01:59:55.04 --> 01:59:56.04 So I dig it.
01:59:56.04 --> 01:59:59.04 But back to psychological warfare.
01:59:59.04 --> 02:00:09.04 If you need a spot or even want a spot with those times that you're like,
02:00:09.04 --> 02:00:10.04 maybe I'll skip the work.
02:00:10.04 --> 02:00:11.04 Maybe I'll slip in the dive.
02:00:11.04 --> 02:00:13.04 I mean, just listen to any track.
02:00:13.04 --> 02:00:15.04 And the track is labeled, you know, where.
02:00:15.04 --> 02:00:19.04 If you can skip on the diet, it's like sugar coated like weight.
02:00:19.04 --> 02:00:20.04 What is it?
02:00:20.04 --> 02:00:21.04 Sugar coated like.
02:00:21.04 --> 02:00:23.04 But it's something something's sugar coated like sugar coated like.
02:00:23.04 --> 02:00:24.04 It's just sugar coated like.
02:00:24.04 --> 02:00:25.04 Yeah.
02:00:25.04 --> 02:00:26.04 So you listen to that.
02:00:26.04 --> 02:00:29.04 And then what's good is it's not some inspirational.
02:00:29.04 --> 02:00:30.04 And you can do it.
02:00:30.04 --> 02:00:32.04 It's not that it's like, it's pragmatic.
02:00:32.04 --> 02:00:33.04 I hear to do that.
02:00:33.04 --> 02:00:34.04 Well, here's the thing though.
02:00:34.04 --> 02:00:38.04 You, but just by nature, you're tone of voice kind of kind of like,
02:00:38.04 --> 02:00:42.04 by happens, stands inserts that concept in it.
02:00:42.04 --> 02:00:44.04 So it's kind of a double, double thing.
02:00:44.04 --> 02:00:48.04 It turns out, but primarily it's just a pragmatic thing.
02:00:48.04 --> 02:00:50.04 Think about think about this.
02:00:50.04 --> 02:00:52.04 Logical stuff.
02:00:52.04 --> 02:00:54.04 And then at the end of the track, you kind of conclude that,
02:00:54.04 --> 02:00:55.04 Oh yeah.
02:00:55.04 --> 02:00:56.04 It's going to get after it.
02:00:56.04 --> 02:00:57.04 Yeah, exactly right.
02:00:57.04 --> 02:00:59.04 That's what psychological warfare is.
02:00:59.04 --> 02:01:01.04 It is on iTunes.
02:01:01.04 --> 02:01:02.04 Amazon music.
02:01:02.04 --> 02:01:03.04 Google play.
02:01:03.04 --> 02:01:04.04 Whatever you can get,
02:01:04.04 --> 02:01:05.04 and be three.
02:01:05.04 --> 02:01:06.04 True story.
02:01:06.04 --> 02:01:07.04 A bit of support.
02:01:07.04 --> 02:01:12.04 Also, you get Jocquite and if you're having trouble dead lifting less than 8,000 pounds,
02:01:12.04 --> 02:01:14.04 if you get Jocquite T, that will be solved immediately.
02:01:14.04 --> 02:01:17.04 And your deadlift will then be 8,000 pounds,
02:01:17.04 --> 02:01:20.04 including Jordan B. Peterson, who can now deadlift 8,000 pounds.
02:01:20.04 --> 02:01:22.04 He broke through his 7,000 pounds.
02:01:22.04 --> 02:01:23.04 Yeah.
02:01:23.04 --> 02:01:24.04 Cappereeer.
02:01:24.04 --> 02:01:24.04 Yeah.
02:01:24.04 --> 02:01:25.04 Buryer.
02:01:25.04 --> 02:01:26.04 Bucks.
02:01:26.04 --> 02:01:27.04 I got some books.
02:01:27.04 --> 02:01:29.04 Way the warrior kid.
02:01:29.04 --> 02:01:30.04 Number one.
02:01:30.04 --> 02:01:32.04 Don't let your kid be a winpy kid.
02:01:32.04 --> 02:01:33.04 Why would you do that?
02:01:33.04 --> 02:01:35.04 Why would you let your neighbors kid be a winpy kid?
02:01:35.04 --> 02:01:36.04 Why would you do that?
02:01:36.04 --> 02:01:38.04 Get him on the path.
02:01:38.04 --> 02:01:40.04 Way the warrior kid path.
02:01:40.04 --> 02:01:41.04 Stronger.
02:01:41.04 --> 02:01:41.04 Faster.
02:01:41.04 --> 02:01:42.04 smarter.
02:01:42.04 --> 02:01:43.04 Better.
02:01:43.04 --> 02:01:44.04 Get some extreme ownership.
02:01:44.04 --> 02:01:51.04 The new addition is out and thanks to you all because we added questions.
02:01:51.04 --> 02:01:58.04 Your questions from this podcast into an appendix inside.
02:01:58.04 --> 02:02:01.04 Not every question, but a bunch of them.
02:02:01.04 --> 02:02:02.04 A good amount.
02:02:02.04 --> 02:02:03.04 So they're in there.
02:02:03.04 --> 02:02:06.04 There's also new forward and some new color pictures.
02:02:06.04 --> 02:02:07.04 Color pictures.
02:02:07.04 --> 02:02:08.04 Interesting.
02:02:08.04 --> 02:02:09.04 Yeah.
02:02:09.04 --> 02:02:10.04 Because I don't like color pictures.
02:02:10.04 --> 02:02:11.04 I said no.
02:02:11.04 --> 02:02:12.04 That caught on me.
02:02:12.04 --> 02:02:13.04 They said, well, this is more premium.
02:02:13.04 --> 02:02:16.04 I said, no, black and white is premium.
02:02:16.04 --> 02:02:18.04 It's a gift.
02:02:18.04 --> 02:02:23.04 So anyways, if you want to see what I look like in color, then you can get the book.
02:02:23.04 --> 02:02:26.04 But to offset that, I said, okay, fine.
02:02:26.04 --> 02:02:27.04 You want to put color pictures in there.
02:02:27.04 --> 02:02:28.04 Make the whole book black.
02:02:28.04 --> 02:02:29.04 So that's what they did.
02:02:29.04 --> 02:02:31.04 Make the whole book black.
02:02:31.04 --> 02:02:33.04 And that was that.
02:02:33.04 --> 02:02:35.04 And speaking of black also.
02:02:35.04 --> 02:02:39.04 The disponibles freedom field manual is available.
02:02:39.04 --> 02:02:46.04 And I told you about that tagline that the publisher wanted to have like,
02:02:46.04 --> 02:02:49.04 the, this book is a superb gift for holiday season.
02:02:49.04 --> 02:02:52.04 And I told them no.
02:02:52.04 --> 02:02:57.04 The tagline is there's no better gift than discipline.
02:02:57.04 --> 02:02:58.04 That's the truth.
02:02:58.04 --> 02:03:00.04 You know, it's actually true.
02:03:00.04 --> 02:03:04.04 If you could give someone the gift of discipline, would you not be giving them the best gift in life?
02:03:04.04 --> 02:03:05.04 Yes.
02:03:05.04 --> 02:03:08.04 Now you can actually give them the gift of discipline equals freedom field manual.
02:03:08.04 --> 02:03:09.04 So you can do that.
02:03:09.04 --> 02:03:14.04 Now this is important because people keep asking me the field manual.
02:03:14.04 --> 02:03:15.04 Audio version.
02:03:15.04 --> 02:03:19.04 Dispening goes for you and field manual is it is also on iTunes.
02:03:19.04 --> 02:03:22.04 Amazon use a Google play other MP3 platforms.
02:03:22.04 --> 02:03:23.04 It's available right now.

02:04:55.04 --> 02:05:06.04 The power to march to fight to overcome and to get after it.
