00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
This is Jocco podcast number 95 with echo Charles and me, Jocco Willink. Good evening, echo. Good evening.

2
00:00:10.16 --> 00:00:12.96
The President of the United States of America

3
00:00:13.52 --> 00:00:22.46
authorized by active Congress July 9, 1918 takes pleasure in presenting the distinguished service cross to second

4
00:00:22.96 --> 00:00:26.08
Lieutenant Air Corps James K.

5
00:00:26.08 --> 00:00:31.28
K. Kunkl United States Army Air Forces for extraordinary

6
00:00:31.92 --> 00:00:38.000
haremism in connection with military operations against an armed enemy

7
00:00:38.72 --> 00:00:43.76
while serving as a pilot of a P38 fighter airplane in the

8
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
41st fighter squadron

9
00:00:46.48 --> 00:00:50.08
377th fighter group 9th Air Force

10
00:00:50.08 --> 00:00:56.80
in aerial combat against enemy forces on 16 September 1944

11
00:00:57.44 --> 00:01:00.16
during an air mission over Aiken Germany.

12
00:01:01.20 --> 00:01:06.80
On this date while flying as rear man in a squadron on an armed reconnaissance mission

13
00:01:07.04 --> 00:01:13.36
Lieutenant Kunkl noticed that his squadron was about to be surprised by a vastly superior force of

14
00:01:13.36 --> 00:01:22.08
enemy aircraft. On able to summon his leader on the radio, he alone, on hesitatingly, pulled away from his

15
00:01:22.08 --> 00:01:27.44
formation and vigorously attacked the enemy immediately destroying one of his aircraft.

16
00:01:28.24 --> 00:01:33.44
In doing so, Lieutenant Kunkl placed himself in a position to be attacked from rear and above.

17
00:01:35.12 --> 00:01:39.44
When this attack materialized, many hits were registered on his aircraft,

18
00:01:39.44 --> 00:01:43.20
which caught fire burning his face, neck and hands.

19
00:01:44.80 --> 00:01:51.60
Despite his burning plane and the gunfire from enemy planes, Lieutenant Kunkl continued his attack against

20
00:01:51.60 --> 00:01:56.72
the vastly superior enemy force and succeeded in destroying a second enemy aircraft.

21
00:01:57.44 --> 00:02:03.92
Breaking off combat only when force to parachute to safety when his left fuel tank exploded.

22
00:02:03.92 --> 00:02:12.32
Second Lieutenant Kunkl's unquestionable valor in aerial combat is in keeping with the highest

23
00:02:12.32 --> 00:02:18.48
traditions of military service and reflects great credit upon himself the 9th Air Force

24
00:02:18.48 --> 00:02:20.88
and the United States Army Air Forces.

25
00:02:20.88 --> 00:02:36.80
So, that is a military citation for a distinguished service cross and this pilot also flew

26
00:02:37.76 --> 00:02:46.72
missions just after D-Day, including armed reconnaissance flights and attacks on German trains and

27
00:02:46.72 --> 00:02:53.36
vehicles and airfields and also this pilot flew close air support missions to help push

28
00:02:53.36 --> 00:02:59.68
Germany out of France and drive Allied troops towards victory.

29
00:03:02.08 --> 00:03:12.56
And it is an absolute honor to have this pilot this hero on the podcast with us today.

30
00:03:12.56 --> 00:03:21.76
Mr. Jim Kunkl, sir, thank you very much for joining us. It is great to have you on.

31
00:03:24.32 --> 00:03:30.80
And you know, if that wasn't good enough, I am also honored to welcome back to the podcast.

32
00:03:31.52 --> 00:03:39.76
Jim Kunkl's friend, fellow pilot, another American hero, Captain Charlie Plum, F4,

33
00:03:39.76 --> 00:03:48.80
Phantom Pilot, shot down on his 75th mission in Vietnam War and spent six years as a prisoner of

34
00:03:48.80 --> 00:03:55.04
war in Vietnam. Captain Charlie Plum, sir, welcome back to the show.

35
00:03:55.04 --> 00:04:00.72
Thank you, Junkl. Nice to be back. And for those of you that haven't listened to Captain Plum,

36
00:04:00.72 --> 00:04:07.12
the first time he came on the podcast, just stop now. Go to podcast number 76,

37
00:04:07.12 --> 00:04:16.96
because that is a whole incredible story of his time in captivity. It's detailed in the book

38
00:04:16.96 --> 00:04:23.20
that Captain Plum wrote, which is called I Know Hero, but go back and listen to that and then

39
00:04:23.20 --> 00:04:28.16
you can return and you can listen to this podcast. But it was interesting because when we got

40
00:04:28.16 --> 00:04:35.76
done with that first podcast and I was taking Captain Plum to the train station, which is odd in

41
00:04:35.76 --> 00:04:40.16
its own right to have the pilot riding a train. I don't know if you'd approve of that to have

42
00:04:40.16 --> 00:04:46.80
the captain on a train, but he said, hey, I got this buddy, you might want to talk to him.

43
00:04:47.36 --> 00:04:54.08
And he said, he's a World War II pilot, fighter pilot, and he's a big great guy to talk to.

44
00:04:54.08 --> 00:05:00.32
And of course, I said, yeah, absolutely. So it took us a little bit of time, but here we are.

45
00:05:00.32 --> 00:05:04.56
And this is also the first time we've had more than one guest at one time on the podcast.

46
00:05:04.56 --> 00:05:10.48
And sitting amongst you two, my plan is to sit back and listen to you two talk about whatever you

47
00:05:10.48 --> 00:05:17.52
want to talk about. I've heard some of the stories and actually, interestingly,

48
00:05:18.40 --> 00:05:25.04
the podcast that just came out last week was about a book called The Minute On Him, which

49
00:05:25.04 --> 00:05:34.96
detailed the British participation in the in operation market garden, which started on September 17,

50
00:05:35.60 --> 00:05:43.52
1944. And as I was reading your citation, if you noticed that was September 16, 1944,

51
00:05:43.52 --> 00:05:48.16
that you were shot down. And that's that's right at the beginning or right before that,

52
00:05:48.16 --> 00:05:56.96
that operation took place. That's very true. And of course, I missed it. But I heard some

53
00:05:57.68 --> 00:06:07.76
very interesting stories later on. I was picked up in a back hospital, by the first, well,

54
00:06:07.76 --> 00:06:12.40
the first infantry division picked me out. They saw my shooting and came out and got me.

55
00:06:12.40 --> 00:06:21.12
And thank goodness it was never leave anyone behind. So they didn't leave me behind. And I thank

56
00:06:21.12 --> 00:06:31.92
them for easily. But through the back hospital, to a general hospital, and then a hospital

57
00:06:31.92 --> 00:06:40.64
trained to Paris, and the train was completely full of casualties from the Ironheim operation.

58
00:06:40.64 --> 00:06:47.60
So I wasn't too good at shape at that time to listen to the stories, but later on in the hospital

59
00:06:47.60 --> 00:06:55.44
in Paris, I heard some real horror stories about what went on up there. And being a night

60
00:06:55.44 --> 00:07:02.72
therefore as pilot, we were working with the ground troops, and we really appreciated what

61
00:07:02.72 --> 00:07:12.000
their problems were on the difficulties that they had. And we tried to help them in every way that we could.

62
00:07:13.12 --> 00:07:18.64
So that was a very trying time.

63
00:07:19.84 --> 00:07:27.28
So I guess before we get into all that at any greater depth, how did you end up as a pilot?

64
00:07:27.28 --> 00:07:32.80
What, you know, how did you end up there? In terms of where did you grow up and I knew you

65
00:07:32.80 --> 00:07:40.000
grew up here in California? No, I was born in Pennsylvania. And New Kensington Pennsylvania, my father

66
00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:50.56
was in the steel business. And in 1932, my dad passed away from injuries that he had received

67
00:07:50.56 --> 00:07:58.80
in the first World War. And so we at that time he had retired from his business, even though he was only

68
00:07:58.80 --> 00:08:07.76
36 years old at that time. But we were coming to California. And in fact, we were pretty well packed,

69
00:08:07.76 --> 00:08:15.60
and had closed the house and the whole works. I'm nine years old. And he went to the hospital in New York

70
00:08:15.60 --> 00:08:23.44
instead and passed away. And my mother who didn't even drive an automobile at that time,

71
00:08:24.16 --> 00:08:30.64
I can remember her asking me, do you want to go to California? And I said yes.

72
00:08:31.68 --> 00:08:41.60
And she took some driving lessons and bought a Chevy, and we came to California on Route 66 when they

73
00:08:41.60 --> 00:08:48.96
were building it. And so my mother prayed to her way to California. I then, if she was a

74
00:08:48.96 --> 00:08:57.52
driver, I bet she wasn't the only one that was afraid. Even at nine, I can still remember

75
00:08:58.56 --> 00:09:08.32
she was driving in the mud of Texas, and I'm out pushing. So my mother was a very courageous woman

76
00:09:08.32 --> 00:09:16.56
without doubt. So my dad had been very interested in aviation, and I picked that up. And back

77
00:09:18.40 --> 00:09:29.60
he used to do steel castings for Kurdish right in Buffalo, New York, and we'd go up there.

78
00:09:29.60 --> 00:09:37.76
And every time we went on a trip, and on 6, 7, 8 years old, we'd go flying. Wow, we'd go for a ride

79
00:09:37.76 --> 00:09:46.88
someplace. And so I picked it up at that time and pursued it. And then you get out to California,

80
00:09:46.88 --> 00:09:52.32
and that's where you go through high school and whatnot. Through high school, I ended up in

81
00:09:52.32 --> 00:10:03.04
Beverly Hills High School, and September 1939, as you know, the war started. We'll participate

82
00:10:03.04 --> 00:10:10.40
of that. I mean, it was all the talk of Europe and the possible over the war, and I decided that

83
00:10:10.40 --> 00:10:17.04
this is going to be my senior year. And if there's going to be a war, we're going to be in it,

84
00:10:17.04 --> 00:10:22.88
one way or another. And so I went out and joined the California International Guard.

85
00:10:22.88 --> 00:10:33.92
They had a squadron that was based in Griffith Park, California, and this is a bunch of

86
00:10:33.92 --> 00:10:41.76
World War I pilots. We had some old bi-planes, Douglas O38, observation aircraft,

87
00:10:43.12 --> 00:10:50.80
open cockpit, and some of the later ones had even had a canopy over. And I really

88
00:10:50.80 --> 00:10:58.32
had been hanging around their ports. My mother was very helpful. She was this before I had a

89
00:10:58.32 --> 00:11:04.08
driver's license. She would take me out to the local airport's Grand Central Air Term room.

90
00:11:04.08 --> 00:11:10.000
I'd spend the whole day Saturday out there, and sometimes you'd even get a 10-minute ride

91
00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:18.24
if anybody had any money to buy gas with. But coming back to the guard, I spent a year with them.

92
00:11:18.24 --> 00:11:25.92
And it was a very, very interesting year. These fellows that were the pilots, they were all

93
00:11:26.64 --> 00:11:35.92
mostly combat pilots from World War I. And I set up their knee and listened to all the stories.

94
00:11:36.96 --> 00:11:46.08
From that, of course, my idea was I wasn't going to be a fighter pilot. I had friends at

95
00:11:46.08 --> 00:11:54.24
Lockheed, and I knew about the P38. And I decided that I wanted to fly a P38, so I wanted to go to England.

96
00:11:55.84 --> 00:12:04.000
And luckily it worked out that way. So what year did you transfer from the Air National Guard

97
00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.20
into, and how did you get a commission? Do you get a commission? Do you have to go to college?

98
00:12:07.20 --> 00:12:09.92
You don't have to go to college at that time to get a commission and be a pilot.

99
00:12:09.92 --> 00:12:20.56
Actually, the guard was fertilized and we went on maneuvers to Jailus Washington. And we were attacking

100
00:12:21.36 --> 00:12:31.92
Fort Lewis. And the guard, we were the attackers, and we were up there for three weeks on maneuvers.

101
00:12:32.48 --> 00:12:39.12
Well, while we were up there, we got noticed that the air guard was going to be fertilized and

102
00:12:39.12 --> 00:12:46.96
drawn into active duty. And I wasn't 18 years old yet. So I had to have permission.

103
00:12:46.96 --> 00:12:52.48
Were you already a pilot at this time? Oh no, I'm a gunner. I'm a murderer.

104
00:12:52.48 --> 00:12:59.76
Gunner and a gunner. I got a plan that would maybe go out in 50 miles an hour.

105
00:12:59.76 --> 00:13:08.000
So, but no, I was in the armament section and it was run by a sergeant white.

106
00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:14.24
Sergeant white kind of took me under his wing and I got some pretty nice assignments out of it.

107
00:13:14.24 --> 00:13:22.56
And I learned a lot. I got the fly in the back seat and I'd go out on weekends.

108
00:13:23.28 --> 00:13:29.36
You know, we had duty once a month in the guard, but you could go out on weekends and I'd work at the

109
00:13:29.36 --> 00:13:39.76
airport and dinner next to a flight in and the pilots of the guard were if they knew you were interested,

110
00:13:40.24 --> 00:13:43.76
they would take you under their wings. So I got quite a bit of flying time.

111
00:13:44.96 --> 00:13:53.68
And it's for a 17 year old. If you're 17 years old, I was just 17. In fact, I was 16 when I joined.

112
00:13:53.68 --> 00:14:04.72
And so, but you know, this cut into my school, not the academics because I wanted to be

113
00:14:06.40 --> 00:14:11.20
Air Force pilot. You had to be 21. You had to have two years of college.

114
00:14:12.40 --> 00:14:21.68
And in 1941, this is getting pretty tight to win re-enered reward.

115
00:14:21.68 --> 00:14:27.20
So I didn't really figure I was going to graduate from college. So I wanted to get in the

116
00:14:27.92 --> 00:14:32.72
classes that would do me the most good if I could become an aviation cadet.

117
00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:43.84
And it all worked out. We, the interesting thing was to me,

118
00:14:43.84 --> 00:14:53.28
in April, I took some time off on school and I went down and got a job at North American aviation.

119
00:14:53.84 --> 00:15:01.68
And I worked on the first 10 P-51s bill. I didn't see them once today on the line. In fact,

120
00:15:01.68 --> 00:15:09.44
one of the original first 10 is in the museum of Ashkosh. So someplace within that airframe,

121
00:15:09.44 --> 00:15:19.36
there's some of my work. And that was, that would have been the summer of 1941.

122
00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:28.16
September and I was going back to school and I had become accustomed to all that money.

123
00:15:28.16 --> 00:15:33.52
I had been making it North American. We got 35 cents an hour when I started there.

124
00:15:33.52 --> 00:15:41.28
But you know, 35 cents an hour wasn't too bad because I worked alongside people that had two or three

125
00:15:41.28 --> 00:15:47.92
kids and they're supporting the whole family on their 35 cents an hour. We had a little

126
00:15:48.64 --> 00:15:56.48
labor dispute at North American and they raised it to 50 cents. So we were really rolling in cash.

127
00:15:56.48 --> 00:16:04.88
But in September, I wanted to get back to school, but I enjoyed that income. So I went to

128
00:16:04.88 --> 00:16:13.84
Lockheed. They had a graveyard shift. And I worked at 7th and Santa Fe, downtown Los Angeles,

129
00:16:14.88 --> 00:16:21.60
Lockheed aircraft had taken over this big warehouse and they were building the wings and the

130
00:16:21.60 --> 00:16:28.08
emmenaged for the P38 and there are also building the wings for the Hudson bomber,

131
00:16:28.08 --> 00:16:38.24
which they'd gotten a very large contract from from the British. And it, I was there when the

132
00:16:38.24 --> 00:16:43.60
war started actually. I was there the night that they attacked Los Angeles and the whole place

133
00:16:43.60 --> 00:16:50.24
was blocked out. If you remember the famous story of the air raid on Los Angeles,

134
00:16:50.24 --> 00:16:55.76
I don't remember that story. Well, he clearly actually I wasn't even close to being born,

135
00:16:55.76 --> 00:17:02.72
but neither was my dad. So what happened with the attack laws in Los Angeles? Well, I miss out on

136
00:17:02.72 --> 00:17:08.56
those. The probably the most logical story that I ever heard was that a navy,

137
00:17:09.36 --> 00:17:16.96
PBY flew over Los Angeles and somebody hit the panic button and all the search lights came on and

138
00:17:16.96 --> 00:17:24.72
you could hear an aircraft in the background probably from Fort McArthur or someplace like that.

139
00:17:24.72 --> 00:17:31.68
And the whole Lockheed plant was blocked out. So we sat there in the dark for about three hours

140
00:17:31.68 --> 00:17:39.60
while they fought this battle with the unseen enemy. And it, of course, made all of the newspapers

141
00:17:39.60 --> 00:17:50.72
with a big story. So anyway, World War II started as far as the U.S. was concerned December 7th.

142
00:17:52.08 --> 00:18:02.08
Right after that, they dropped the age limit from 21 to 18 for the aviation cadet program.

143
00:18:02.08 --> 00:18:12.96
They dropped the two-year college requirement to a high school. And so I went down and signed up

144
00:18:12.96 --> 00:18:23.04
with about 300,000 others dressed. There was that many people that wanted to be pilots all

145
00:18:23.04 --> 00:18:32.48
there. They were thick. Wow. In fact, I was quite concerned. I signed up. They

146
00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:40.80
that would have been in June. I waited until September before they called me down to

147
00:18:40.80 --> 00:18:50.40
downtown Los Angeles. Swarming in is a private as a duration as cadet. And so I will now

148
00:18:50.40 --> 00:18:56.80
I'm on my way. Well, and I went home and waited another four or five months before they called us.

149
00:18:56.80 --> 00:19:02.32
They had so many people that, and there was no place to put them. They were trying to build

150
00:19:02.32 --> 00:19:10.48
San Ann Army Air Base, which was the induction area for cadets on the west coast.

151
00:19:11.36 --> 00:19:17.28
And every just overwhelmed with, they didn't even have the barracks to put them in.

152
00:19:17.28 --> 00:19:29.12
So eventually I got called up and I went through in a little lesson 10 months to Santa Ana,

153
00:19:29.12 --> 00:19:36.72
which was a pre-flight, went up to Larry, California, for primary in Stermons,

154
00:19:37.68 --> 00:19:45.52
to Tex Rankin School, and Texit Binae, the aerobatic champion of the U.S. And so

155
00:19:45.52 --> 00:19:52.72
there was a fun school. So they hired the best civilian pilot and had them come out and train you guys?

156
00:19:52.72 --> 00:20:00.16
That's correct. In fact, Tex actually owned that operation. They appointed most of the primary

157
00:20:00.16 --> 00:20:10.72
was a private enterprise. There were set up by the Air Force for cadet training in primary

158
00:20:10.72 --> 00:20:20.72
bases. And so you went through about 60 hours, I flew this theorem and we have behind us our

159
00:20:20.72 --> 00:20:27.36
competitor, but this aircraft was used mainly on these coasts. We didn't see many of them out,

160
00:20:27.36 --> 00:20:36.48
California, we had Stearmons and Ryan's and the west coast. Got through primary, went the basic

161
00:20:36.48 --> 00:20:42.96
now we're on a military base and I went to the Moore, California. And that was one of the largest

162
00:20:46.40 --> 00:20:57.04
air force bases or Army Air Corps bases. And it's just, on final you can still see the hangars

163
00:20:57.04 --> 00:21:01.84
and everything. But final at the Moore Naval Air Station, you can still see all the hangars

164
00:21:01.84 --> 00:21:11.68
from, from our old base. But got through basic, went down to Williamsfield, Arizona and

165
00:21:13.12 --> 00:21:21.68
that brought me closer to the P38. Most of the P38 came out of Williamsfield to South of Phoenix.

166
00:21:22.72 --> 00:21:30.64
And from there we were on a fast track and we weren't quite sure why we were on this big fast track

167
00:21:30.64 --> 00:21:41.44
but all of a sudden we get 90 days, I got to fire the guns once in the P38. One gun, we had

168
00:21:41.44 --> 00:21:46.24
four fifties in the 20 millimeter and the nose and they let us fire one of the fifties.

169
00:21:47.68 --> 00:21:53.44
All of a sudden we're on a train going to the east coast and we're heading for England.

170
00:21:53.44 --> 00:22:01.20
Wow. When you, when you said you wanted to fly a P38 and yet you had worked on the P51s,

171
00:22:01.20 --> 00:22:06.40
what was the deciding factor that made you want to fly a P38 instead of a P51?

172
00:22:07.20 --> 00:22:16.56
The P38 was a high-old, a two fighter. It was, it was our first real combat aircraft. The

173
00:22:16.56 --> 00:22:26.80
P40 was a stop-capped airplane, did very well. P39 didn't do well at all. The P38 was the only

174
00:22:26.80 --> 00:22:32.80
high-performance airplane we had. The P51 at the time that I worked on, it was a low-altitude airplane.

175
00:22:32.80 --> 00:22:39.12
Got an Allison engine and then you think above 11 to 12,000 feet you were out of power.

176
00:22:39.12 --> 00:22:52.16
So the P51 was going to be a low-altitude British-used aircraft and that's what they wanted.

177
00:22:52.16 --> 00:23:02.000
Extremely fast and they used it for tactical work. So that, as far as I wanted to be in

178
00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:11.12
an aerial combat, I wanted to be a fighter pilot and shoot down a bunch of airplanes. So I stuck with

179
00:23:11.12 --> 00:23:17.28
the 38 and of course I didn't realize the British were putting the Merle an engine in the P51

180
00:23:17.28 --> 00:23:22.000
about that time and we were going to get the greatest there to hear combat airplane of the war.

181
00:23:22.80 --> 00:23:28.40
But yeah, I guess that's what threw me off was because I always thought of the P51 as being

182
00:23:28.40 --> 00:23:36.72
the best air to air combat aircraft of the war but I didn't realize that it didn't get there

183
00:23:36.72 --> 00:23:40.80
immediately and it had to get there in stages so that makes sense to me now.

184
00:23:40.80 --> 00:23:46.32
Well, they did come in stages and plus the fact that when they did get the Merle an engine that

185
00:23:46.32 --> 00:23:52.40
went to the 8th Air Force and the 8th Air Force had the greatest P01 group in the whole world.

186
00:23:52.40 --> 00:24:03.76
They had access to all the newspapers. They got all the publicity. The P51 was the greatest

187
00:24:03.76 --> 00:24:12.32
airplane in the whole world. The Pural P38 had been soldering from early 1942 in the Pacific

188
00:24:12.32 --> 00:24:19.76
on to North Africa and doing well all the way and no matter what you ask it to do it could do it.

189
00:24:19.76 --> 00:24:35.04
So I was still a P38 fan. I got to England and I had great interest in aerial combat.

190
00:24:35.04 --> 00:24:42.08
There was a fellow by the name of Scroop Ball Burling who was an RAF pilot and he was one of the

191
00:24:42.08 --> 00:24:53.92
greatest deflection shooting experts in combat I guess and he was the hero of Malta in the RAF.

192
00:24:53.92 --> 00:24:57.36
So you said the greatest what deflection shooting?

193
00:24:57.36 --> 00:25:04.88
Which is what is that? That means that when you're coming in on an aircraft

194
00:25:04.88 --> 00:25:12.56
if you're on his tail you got zero deflection. If he's in a turn now you've got to move the

195
00:25:12.56 --> 00:25:17.68
note your your aim point out in front of that airplane. Got it and you've got what they call

196
00:25:17.68 --> 00:25:27.84
a hundred millsite which was it I forgot now I guess but it was about so many inches for

197
00:25:27.84 --> 00:25:38.000
thousand feet and on radio I would say if you were in a 30 degree turn you might put one

198
00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:47.28
radio I or radio I on half in front of him and it's all eyeball 90 degrees you're out maybe seven

199
00:25:47.28 --> 00:25:57.28
radii way out here and so best deflection shooting. Now this is before we got the gyrosite

200
00:25:58.08 --> 00:26:04.32
which we never got in the p38 but the 51 got the gyrosite that computed that for you.

201
00:26:04.96 --> 00:26:11.20
So you put the size of the airplane would be put into the site by a little slide

202
00:26:11.20 --> 00:26:24.08
not adjusted your site on your reflector and so then you'd put the paper right on the aircraft

203
00:26:24.08 --> 00:26:33.28
in the site with compute got it the the leads necessary to hit it so anyway I had studied

204
00:26:33.28 --> 00:26:40.08
those angles off you know an hour before you go to sleep after you go to bed you're doing

205
00:26:40.08 --> 00:26:47.44
computations on how many radii lead from what position whether you're going up or going down

206
00:26:47.44 --> 00:26:55.20
or sideways or whichever way you want to go but I'll set for real combat I get the England

207
00:26:56.24 --> 00:27:05.12
and all of a sudden I'm in the ninth era forse now this is the mydera force and the support

208
00:27:05.12 --> 00:27:13.84
of the ground troops and all operations usually have fairly low aldeclics so you're calling them

209
00:27:13.84 --> 00:27:19.20
the mud to air force is that what you said yeah and that's just a that's delineating that these

210
00:27:19.20 --> 00:27:23.68
guys are working with the ground troops and you're flying low and the dream of aerial combat

211
00:27:23.68 --> 00:27:30.40
is not so much there right now it's not right now the glimer force has got the all the

212
00:27:30.40 --> 00:27:36.64
you guys must have been all ears though I mean you talked about screwball but but the RAF pilots

213
00:27:36.64 --> 00:27:41.68
that had fought the battle of Britain I mean did you guys getting lessons learned from them and

214
00:27:41.68 --> 00:27:48.000
and were they actually directly teaching you guys at all they talked to us we didn't have any

215
00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:55.20
formal instruction from them the conversations and usually at the bar at the O club or officers club

216
00:27:55.20 --> 00:28:03.52
as we called it I got two two good points old RF sergeant who had flown in the battle of Britain

217
00:28:04.24 --> 00:28:09.84
told me that if you have a jury on your tail do something violent

218
00:28:10.64 --> 00:28:15.92
I said definitely any difference what it is just make sure it's violent and the second thing

219
00:28:15.92 --> 00:28:21.92
was keep your eye on his exhaust because that's the first indication you're going to get

220
00:28:21.92 --> 00:28:30.64
of what's worth is trying to do and I thought those were two good points and I used a couple times

221
00:28:30.64 --> 00:28:35.68
yeah the the violent piece I mean you could apply that to really many situations in life where

222
00:28:36.24 --> 00:28:40.96
you know we see people and they're they're in a bad position in life they need to do something

223
00:28:40.96 --> 00:28:46.72
violent to move out of that situation not just there and wait for something to unfold that was not

224
00:28:46.72 --> 00:28:54.72
only air combat that's interesting about watching the exhaust because you'd see a change that

225
00:28:54.72 --> 00:28:59.12
like a plume come out of the exhaust or you see the exhaust cut off and you'd know what type

226
00:28:59.12 --> 00:29:05.44
of maneuver they were going to do he's trying to pull a fast one and you have to power off and you

227
00:29:05.44 --> 00:29:15.60
overrun him and he shoots you down so but the mud air force that came along we begin to realize

228
00:29:15.60 --> 00:29:24.08
just how much help we were to the ground forces and and it was pretty primitive I covered

229
00:29:24.08 --> 00:29:32.56
you a lot of area here in the big and we were really short time but you know we we had we had no

230
00:29:32.56 --> 00:29:41.84
navigational radio we could have four channel BHAs that meant that usually we could talk

231
00:29:41.84 --> 00:29:48.64
amongst the squadron but the word was don't be a near-aix squadron don't talk on the RT

232
00:29:48.64 --> 00:29:56.48
yeah stay off we had that same philosophy and all my seal puttunes and seal task you know

233
00:29:56.48 --> 00:30:05.52
it's stay off the radio and now you're trying you know we're doing ground support they give us

234
00:30:05.52 --> 00:30:12.40
coordinates on the chart now you're going to go out and find it with the and it's all i ball

235
00:30:13.68 --> 00:30:19.76
so when you're eyeballing the ground and you're looking for ground targets you're wide open

236
00:30:19.76 --> 00:30:29.28
in your six six o'clock position so so would you fly with multiple people or multiple aircraft

237
00:30:29.28 --> 00:30:37.04
so someone had the duty of watching the rear yes we did in fact that's I got the duty several times

238
00:30:38.24 --> 00:30:46.88
what we did we've usually flew as a squadron sometimes we'd fly as a group with three squadrons

239
00:30:46.88 --> 00:30:55.92
usually we'd try to put out at least twelve aircraft as a squadron max would be maybe four flights of

240
00:30:55.92 --> 00:31:08.000
four sixteen and so to answer your question about you know being attacked from the rear and so

241
00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:15.12
forth in the six o'clock the Germans developed the tactic against the the tactical aircraft

242
00:31:15.12 --> 00:31:24.96
which we were and they would they started vectoring their fighters in with ground control radar

243
00:31:24.96 --> 00:31:31.60
and your first indication there was all of a sudden you had a swarm of the enemy aircraft that

244
00:31:31.60 --> 00:31:41.84
you six o'clock and in early August 44 one of our sister groups p thirty eight group nine

245
00:31:41.84 --> 00:31:53.12
therapores lost a half a squadron just they got hit they were surprised and so we thought well

246
00:31:53.12 --> 00:31:58.48
well we better start we better do something about that so we started putting a couple of

247
00:31:58.48 --> 00:32:06.72
experienced people instead of putting your your first mission following the rear end purple

248
00:32:06.72 --> 00:32:13.36
heart corner we called it let him drag along where we stop well let's put somebody back there

249
00:32:13.36 --> 00:32:20.32
of this gonna have a little experience anyway and and so we we did that and I drew one of the first

250
00:32:20.32 --> 00:32:29.52
the missions back there and and sure enough really came and I spotted them and it called the

251
00:32:29.52 --> 00:32:35.44
break and made the break and squadron kept on going and the break is you're saying hey I'm

252
00:32:35.44 --> 00:32:39.52
going to break off from the squadron right now or someone needs to come with me or we need to face

253
00:32:39.52 --> 00:32:43.60
this other issue over here we got a bunch of enemy aircraft coming that's what that's what

254
00:32:43.60 --> 00:32:49.28
calling the break is call your break you know when you call the break they whoever spotted the

255
00:32:49.28 --> 00:32:55.36
aircraft leads the break because you don't want to lose them you can't take if you see them you

256
00:32:55.36 --> 00:33:02.40
got to keep your eyeball on them or you're gonna lose them and so you make the you call the

257
00:33:02.40 --> 00:33:07.76
break you make your break into them from whatever position they're coming from the squadron

258
00:33:07.76 --> 00:33:14.64
then we'll break with you and so all of our craft are now turning into the enemy and

259
00:33:14.64 --> 00:33:24.64
probably an experienced air-derer combat group that was just an orable procedure

260
00:33:25.28 --> 00:33:34.000
our 9th therefore guys we didn't do much of this and so when I called I called the break I made

261
00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:40.88
the break and all of a sudden I'm by myself it's quadron kept on going and now whether they didn't

262
00:33:40.88 --> 00:33:50.40
hear me or whatever I I have no idea so all I had was a couple of W1 90s and around circle

263
00:33:50.40 --> 00:33:57.84
sitting on a flat wing and all that up 20 millimeters and we're doing we got into a pretty tight

264
00:33:57.84 --> 00:34:08.88
turn and and all of a sudden I lost them in the turn and I'm looking at my six o'clock and

265
00:34:08.88 --> 00:34:16.80
you might have been facing backwards it would have been a lot easier but I turned around front

266
00:34:16.80 --> 00:34:27.60
and in my gun sight here's a W1 90 I mean I'm on top of it and he apparently spotted me about

267
00:34:27.60 --> 00:34:34.48
the same type I think I fired a burst at him I'm not even sure but he did a flick roll so quick

268
00:34:34.48 --> 00:34:41.68
but I literally he just flick rolled out of my thing P30 it wouldn't do that the early ones

269
00:34:43.04 --> 00:34:49.36
the later ones had a yellow-rong boost and they would actually could perform that fast roll

270
00:34:49.36 --> 00:34:58.96
radar roll so he he got away from me and I was in a perfectly wonderful shot position to shooting down

271
00:34:58.96 --> 00:35:08.96
so that was our first encounter the second encounter was going where you had read the citation

272
00:35:08.96 --> 00:35:12.88
I made the right nobody came with me and I had more than I could have handled

273
00:35:15.28 --> 00:35:20.80
when you before we get to that one when you were doing close air support for troops on the ground

274
00:35:20.80 --> 00:35:26.32
and you had four radio nets that you could be on would you be talking to the guys on the ground

275
00:35:26.32 --> 00:35:34.80
yes and sometimes you could you be under with the control now the the night therefore

276
00:35:34.80 --> 00:35:42.96
it was mainly P47s we had one group of P51s 354th and they had been the pioneer group with the

277
00:35:42.96 --> 00:35:50.80
Merlin power 51 but they ended up in the ninth Air Force but usually they were used with the

278
00:35:50.80 --> 00:35:59.28
eight therefore for the escort of the bombers but so the majority and the ninth Air Force was

279
00:35:59.28 --> 00:36:05.12
a big Air Force we had a lot of fighter groups I forgot now how many we actually have but most

280
00:36:05.12 --> 00:36:18.24
of them were P47s and 47 was a great aircraft for close support and we had four groups of P38s in the

281
00:36:18.24 --> 00:36:28.16
evening so most of the close support work was done by the P47s in a real max effort we were used

282
00:36:28.16 --> 00:36:38.72
to close support but the P47 was very short ranged 38 we had a lot of range we could carry a

283
00:36:38.72 --> 00:36:45.84
larger bomb load than either the 47 and the 51 actually the 38 could carry two

284
00:36:45.84 --> 00:36:55.28
thousand pound bombs that's four thousand pounds and that's your up in B17 country with that so

285
00:36:57.52 --> 00:37:03.60
we couldn't always get them usually we could find some thousand pound but normally we carry two

286
00:37:03.60 --> 00:37:11.52
500s I like the thousand because the bigger the bang is the less chance you have to go back and do it again

287
00:37:11.52 --> 00:37:20.48
and when you went back to do it again they're waiting for you so up until that point that was kind

288
00:37:20.48 --> 00:37:26.72
of your primary mission that was going in and hitting railway stations or new nation's factories

289
00:37:26.72 --> 00:37:32.40
are in reconnaissance anything that moved and if you're good and finding a thing you moved you try

290
00:37:32.40 --> 00:37:38.72
to shoot the insulators all the high tension lines so any anything you could get

291
00:37:38.72 --> 00:37:47.68
we there was no problem finding targets and different from the eight there of course

292
00:37:49.76 --> 00:37:57.84
we were over the target area in a relatively short time so they were shooting at you most of the time

293
00:37:59.12 --> 00:38:03.76
how long did you how long did you arrive in England before D-Day actually happened?

294
00:38:03.76 --> 00:38:09.84
uh just a short time before D-Day and I forgot the exact date that we did arrive in England

295
00:38:09.84 --> 00:38:16.80
and had you filmed missions before D-Day started? no so your first missions were actually

296
00:38:16.80 --> 00:38:23.36
right right and the 38's and because they were so easy to recognize in the air

297
00:38:24.80 --> 00:38:32.72
we were assigned the channel we we flew top cover for the channel all the shipping and everything

298
00:38:32.72 --> 00:38:42.40
between England and the beachhead and we at that time it became very apparent that the reason we

299
00:38:42.40 --> 00:38:50.64
had been rushed into through training into England is they anticipated heavy losses

300
00:38:52.40 --> 00:38:58.56
we expected they lived off the really show during the invasion they didn't

301
00:38:58.56 --> 00:39:06.72
I think you read that there were just I think they had two sorties over the beachhead on D-Day

302
00:39:07.36 --> 00:39:15.92
and we anticipated that there would be a large effort against the the channel with all the shipping

303
00:39:15.92 --> 00:39:22.08
I mean you could probably walk across the channel with a number of ships there were there

304
00:39:22.08 --> 00:39:34.24
uh this tremendous target the foothold didn't show up so most of the like my group the

305
00:39:35.20 --> 00:39:45.84
the day missions were pretty boring when D-Day was about to go I mean it's every single person

306
00:39:45.84 --> 00:39:51.20
you guys must have absolutely known that what you were about to do was that was you know going to be

307
00:39:51.20 --> 00:39:59.52
the one of the most epic undertakings of the modern history oh yes it was a hundred percent

308
00:39:59.52 --> 00:40:07.28
you guys all knew that and it was every little by road in England there's jammed with equipment

309
00:40:08.08 --> 00:40:16.72
and you know it's funny coming back to some of the things we hear today about our country

310
00:40:16.72 --> 00:40:27.60
in 1940 41 I was well 1940 I was up into Hale, Swarsington and we were flying

311
00:40:28.72 --> 00:40:35.04
those old 38s we had two brand new airplanes from North American, oh 47s

312
00:40:35.04 --> 00:40:41.44
half thousand horsepower greater aircraft not worth a damn combat but

313
00:40:41.44 --> 00:40:51.28
we knew that we were again working with the with the ground troops and we would fill

314
00:40:51.28 --> 00:40:59.68
a little paper socks with a white with a flower and that was our bombing we attacked them what the

315
00:40:59.68 --> 00:41:07.60
bridge had and throw toilet paper out and these little socks full of a flower and if you drape

316
00:41:07.60 --> 00:41:14.40
toilet paper over a bridge on the squally river the infantry couldn't use it anymore so they had to

317
00:41:14.40 --> 00:41:23.12
get across the river some other way and mortars crossed two by fours served as a mortar

318
00:41:25.20 --> 00:41:32.56
cavalry on horses we they got lost we had to go look for them now that's in 1940

319
00:41:32.56 --> 00:41:44.24
in June 44 as far as you could see is American made equipment everything not only what we were

320
00:41:44.24 --> 00:41:51.28
carrying but we supplied the British and everyone else this magnificent effort by this magnificent

321
00:41:51.28 --> 00:42:00.56
country and you just it's unbelievable when you think back just before D Day as I say every

322
00:42:00.56 --> 00:42:08.32
every little robe was jammed with stored equipment can't imagine that's one of the island didn't

323
00:42:08.32 --> 00:42:15.76
sink but no I I've actually on a recent podcast I was talking about the fact that

324
00:42:16.88 --> 00:42:24.48
many of American or at least as much of America's victories in many cases have to be attributed to

325
00:42:24.48 --> 00:42:29.68
our ability to produce and make things and America's incredible ability to like you said

326
00:42:29.68 --> 00:42:37.28
build such incredible equipment and such a short amount of time it's it's epic it really was and we switched

327
00:42:37.28 --> 00:42:45.20
from isolation Henry Ford was the nice solution that's I understand and he turns around and build

328
00:42:45.20 --> 00:42:51.60
the bomber plans to turn it out six seven eight ten B twenty fours a day yeah so

329
00:42:51.60 --> 00:43:02.96
this fantastic effort but we all stood together in those days yeah when when I always read that

330
00:43:02.96 --> 00:43:08.80
for D Day they they wanted troops not all but they were looking for they brought a lot of troops

331
00:43:08.80 --> 00:43:14.40
that didn't have any combat experience I don't think five percent of the people that hit the

332
00:43:14.40 --> 00:43:20.16
beaches have experience you know as funny I got in trouble in Paris a few years out of your

333
00:43:20.16 --> 00:43:30.16
good now this is a good story my wife can hear it she was there in fact but we were in a dinner in

334
00:43:30.16 --> 00:43:40.16
Paris and D Day celebration and I made a mistake I stood up and said to the people in the room

335
00:43:40.16 --> 00:43:49.52
that the ground troops here the infantry all you people that landed on D Day I said D Day is

336
00:43:49.52 --> 00:43:56.96
your day it's not the air forces day the missions we flew on D Day were what we've been doing for

337
00:43:57.92 --> 00:44:06.08
two years out of England and it was there was no better no worse but when you stop and think

338
00:44:06.08 --> 00:44:15.36
of those kids that hit that beach no experience a lot of thesters no experience in combat

339
00:44:15.36 --> 00:44:24.32
and so in my opinion and all stand by it and I had a few people at the dinner who objected to what I said

340
00:44:25.36 --> 00:44:34.64
but D Day was the guys that hit the beach we we supported them but we didn't do much more than

341
00:44:34.64 --> 00:44:41.84
what we have been doing day after day you know you can talk about the eight there force and

342
00:44:41.84 --> 00:44:49.12
the heavy bombers and the fact that they're there losses were heavy and total marine loss

343
00:44:49.12 --> 00:45:00.40
and were a war too so we we've been hurt but D Day at the long to those youngsters

344
00:45:02.24 --> 00:45:08.56
what was the because these these guys were so you know we're inexperienced when you were out

345
00:45:08.56 --> 00:45:13.20
at a pub in England talking to these army guys that were getting ready to go in

346
00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:17.20
were they just a hundred percent fired up to go

347
00:45:19.76 --> 00:45:25.12
I mean that's the only thing because I can imagine myself when I was 18 or 19 years old

348
00:45:25.12 --> 00:45:31.44
I first was in the military if you would have told me I was going to do a giant amphibious landing

349
00:45:31.44 --> 00:45:40.000
an epic amphibious landing there would have been just nothing but absolute motivation and excitement

350
00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:47.20
from me because I was young and stupid and didn't know any better you know we were all young

351
00:45:47.20 --> 00:45:53.20
yes yeah I guess at some point young and stupid goes a long way does it well I tell you a little

352
00:45:53.20 --> 00:46:01.36
story about that I was I was in camp Kilmer we were in fact we thought we were going to fly across

353
00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:09.60
to England we expected air transportation for they were a group of about 18 pilots

354
00:46:10.48 --> 00:46:18.40
and I think we were set to fly and all of a sudden they gave us all this equipment

355
00:46:18.40 --> 00:46:29.04
and leggings and backpacks and helmet and all this stuff that kind of stuff makes pilots

356
00:46:29.04 --> 00:46:30.64
nervous

357
00:46:30.64 --> 00:46:34.16
well it normally made it nervous made them full of it

358
00:46:35.12 --> 00:46:43.44
nobody knew how to use this stuff and I know I got the leggings on and I know they were from

359
00:46:43.44 --> 00:46:52.56
World War I they gave me this backpack and all of this gas underware and everything and they

360
00:46:52.56 --> 00:46:58.56
didn't tell us how a packet and I went out behind the barracks and there was a close line back there

361
00:46:58.56 --> 00:47:07.20
and I got some close line and I tied to stand pack up for closed line and they gave me a helmet

362
00:47:07.20 --> 00:47:17.04
and I never tried it on so that that evening get ready and we start marching down some

363
00:47:18.56 --> 00:47:26.48
to the gates of the camp Kilmer they load us on trucks and we're over getting on the Queen Elizabeth

364
00:47:27.68 --> 00:47:33.68
and you had to go down a pier and then up a whole bunch of stairs to get to

365
00:47:33.68 --> 00:47:40.96
the entrance to the ship and I had to be four bags with all of my clothes and everything

366
00:47:40.96 --> 00:47:49.36
and I had a bottle of scotch in there and I packed very carefully and I had a portable radio

367
00:47:49.36 --> 00:47:57.60
and portable radios and those days were like 36 inches long full of batteries so I'm carrying

368
00:47:57.60 --> 00:48:05.76
this thing and they gave me this damn helmet but they didn't give me the interior of it and so this

369
00:48:05.76 --> 00:48:13.52
damn without the inside of it every time I took a step it was coming down hit me on the nose

370
00:48:13.52 --> 00:48:22.08
and then bouncing back again we go up the stairs and someplace along the line I set that bag down too long

371
00:48:22.08 --> 00:48:32.56
and now I got scotch really out the bottom hit me four bags and we we come to where they're

372
00:48:32.56 --> 00:48:40.000
checking us and there's a full kernel army kernels and he says my god we're gonna lose the war

373
00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:54.48
so there you go we got people that don't know how to wear their helmets back at their bags

374
00:48:54.48 --> 00:49:04.08
filled with scotch and no one to war so but when you're talking to guys they're ready to go

375
00:49:04.08 --> 00:49:08.64
and he day commences they just don't you know they don't they don't understand what they're

376
00:49:08.64 --> 00:49:15.84
getting into yet and and again maybe to the credit of the planners they decided it's better to have

377
00:49:15.84 --> 00:49:20.64
a bunch of guys that aren't really 100% sure of what to expect and it is to have a bunch of people

378
00:49:20.64 --> 00:49:26.64
that know what they're getting into and know how hard this is gonna be. Well that's very in fact

379
00:49:26.64 --> 00:49:32.64
what I started to say before I got off again you have to watch me very carefully. Wait you have

380
00:49:32.64 --> 00:49:40.80
scotch in your body down there we go down the Alcise Club just before we we're gonna take off

381
00:49:40.80 --> 00:49:49.68
for England and it's quite a party going and there's a little spirits flowing and if you

382
00:49:49.68 --> 00:49:56.72
the World War II barracks buildings where the club was they had a mezzanine on the second floor

383
00:49:56.72 --> 00:50:04.32
and then it's open in the center and all these damn fools from the airborne for up on the second

384
00:50:04.32 --> 00:50:13.44
four yellow and drawn a bow and jump an off and this one kid broke his leg and so I've heard about

385
00:50:13.44 --> 00:50:22.64
guys breaking their leg and then going on to combat that's another story from my friend Charlie Plum what's

386
00:50:22.64 --> 00:50:31.36
that what about oh brother we got so many stories to tell you I was on my way to combat on the

387
00:50:31.36 --> 00:50:38.64
aircraft carrier kitty-off we stopped in Hawaii for our last who raw and so we went out and found

388
00:50:38.64 --> 00:50:44.64
some pubs and whatnot well I had rented a little a motor scooter you know like a little vespot

389
00:50:44.64 --> 00:50:53.92
all right and that's gonna work out well so I'm driving around on Honolulu and I look back and

390
00:50:53.92 --> 00:51:02.000
when I look forward I'm a borsided on an 18 wheeler and so I so I laid that motor scooter on

391
00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:10.64
its side and slid underneath the axle of this truck and pin my right ankle between the frame

392
00:51:10.64 --> 00:51:16.80
and the motor scooter in the truck and so I came out and dusted myself off I'm thinking

393
00:51:16.80 --> 00:51:21.92
okay I'm gonna try to walk you know I'm not walking very well and so I go up to the closest

394
00:51:21.92 --> 00:51:27.36
house and knock in the door and say you know I guess I need a ride to the hospital I went over to

395
00:51:27.36 --> 00:51:36.000
tripward hospital big hospital in Hawaii and then in the dock there looks me and he takes an

396
00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:42.08
x-ray in my leg and you know it was really funny when you see an x-ray of a broken part of your body

397
00:51:42.08 --> 00:51:47.28
you know you you're in disbelief you know you're like wait how come this happened you know you're

398
00:51:47.28 --> 00:51:56.000
in denial and the guy said okay report to uh wing uh bravo uh floor three I said what's on

399
00:51:56.000 --> 00:52:01.36
bravo three you said it's all the other idiots that broke their leg riding motor scooters in Hawaii

400
00:52:01.36 --> 00:52:08.16
and sure enough all these military guys in this military hospital had broken their leg on motor scooters

401
00:52:08.16 --> 00:52:13.68
and so I said I can't do that I'm a fighter pilot you know I just to help start the top

402
00:52:13.68 --> 00:52:19.28
gun school I gotta I gotta get out of here and I gotta go win the war you know and and it on

403
00:52:19.28 --> 00:52:26.08
there we've got this doctor is named as gents and doctor gents and said son take my advice

404
00:52:26.08 --> 00:52:33.76
um you can get into war in six months or so after your leg heals and so what I said I can't

405
00:52:33.76 --> 00:52:38.16
do that I gotta go back to the ship he said you said you can't ride around on a ship of the broken

406
00:52:38.16 --> 00:52:42.96
leg I said no an aircraft carry we've got hospital is the next ray of machines and all this good

407
00:52:42.96 --> 00:52:47.44
stuff we had doctors and surgeons and all this stuff oh no I can't let you do that you know

408
00:52:47.44 --> 00:52:53.84
you report to all the other characters that broke their legs no no I can't do that so I find

409
00:52:53.84 --> 00:52:59.92
I am arguing with this doctor who outranked me my about three ranks and then uh I said tell you

410
00:52:59.92 --> 00:53:06.16
what let me call this ship I'll let you talk to our flight surgeon and he can assure you that

411
00:53:06.16 --> 00:53:13.20
I'll be okay by going back to the ship because I gotta go to the war I so I so I call this ship

412
00:53:13.20 --> 00:53:20.16
well of course the flight surgeon out getting drunk too you know so he went there and in fact

413
00:53:20.16 --> 00:53:27.20
the only one in sick bay on that ship was a was a a corpsman like a third class corpsman okay

414
00:53:27.20 --> 00:53:31.44
and he didn't know what he's doing but I said okay I'm whispering to the guy so okay

415
00:53:31.44 --> 00:53:36.88
to tell tell this doctor that you're in charge of the hospital and that it's okay for me to come back

416
00:53:36.88 --> 00:53:43.44
so sure enough you know he does what I he does the doctor so so I get a cab I got this cast on

417
00:53:43.44 --> 00:53:50.48
now from my way stall went down on my toe got a big toes I mean I broke my ankle you know

418
00:53:50.48 --> 00:53:56.72
not not the rest of my leg but I got this 20 pound cast on and so I got these crutches and I

419
00:53:56.72 --> 00:54:03.44
crutch up the gangway you know and the questionation come warn and the the O.D. says the permission

420
00:54:03.44 --> 00:54:10.000
granted and and I hobble my way into the sick bay okay here's the same third class corpsman

421
00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:15.28
sitting there and he didn't know what he's doing and he doesn't sign me in or anything he says

422
00:54:15.28 --> 00:54:20.000
you know go to the officers quiet room that we got one of those in sick bay and so I crutch my

423
00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:26.16
way back to his quiet room and I I am exhausted I'm totally in this leg of starting to swell

424
00:54:26.16 --> 00:54:33.44
inside the cast and I'm in pain and so I just flopped down in this in this rack okay and the quiet room

425
00:54:33.44 --> 00:54:39.68
well the next thing I hear is the engines of the ship starting up you know we're about to leave

426
00:54:39.68 --> 00:54:48.72
now meanwhile my squadron buddies you know one need to leave no man behind says where's Charlie

427
00:54:48.72 --> 00:54:54.96
they went back on the beach searching for me for the last place they saw me was disappearing towards

428
00:54:54.96 --> 00:55:02.56
diamond head on a vespas and so they look all over for me and come back and report that I'm a wall

429
00:55:02.56 --> 00:55:09.36
okay I miss ships movement all right okay so so I wake up and I know what's happening I

430
00:55:09.36 --> 00:55:13.68
and I gotta tell somebody I'm here nobody else I'm here I'm at the third class corpsman he didn't

431
00:55:13.68 --> 00:55:21.36
sign me and he didn't know who I was okay so so you know yeah these squeeze bottles you know

432
00:55:21.36 --> 00:55:27.20
and in a hospital room and it's supposed to some squeeze on this bottle trying to track the nurse

433
00:55:27.20 --> 00:55:32.72
or something you know it didn't there squeeze squeeze squeeze I finally looked up and the hose from

434
00:55:32.72 --> 00:55:38.96
the bottle was cutting I would just squeeze an air so I get my crutch out which is the only thing I

435
00:55:38.96 --> 00:55:45.60
can move I'm paralyzed I'm banging on the hatch you know and I finally attracted a tension to

436
00:55:45.60 --> 00:55:52.000
this sailor and to say you'd better go up to the ready room and squadron 1114 and you better tell

437
00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:57.20
him up there that I'm down here well it wasn't probably two minutes later the committee

438
00:55:57.20 --> 00:56:04.000
and officer standing in the doorway all right and he is none happy he said I've got 17 pilots it's

439
00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:09.68
said and I got 16 he said he said first of all I said what are they telling you when are you

440
00:56:09.68 --> 00:56:19.12
gonna be ready to fly again I said six weeks well I you know weeks months I kind of got that

441
00:56:19.12 --> 00:56:25.84
confused and he said you're going home I'm gonna get a replacement pilot you oh no please please

442
00:56:25.84 --> 00:56:29.44
please let me stay I gotta stay with the squadron you don't gotta be with the troops and

443
00:56:29.44 --> 00:56:35.36
all please and so now you're going home oh please be I said okay Skipper what if I

444
00:56:36.56 --> 00:56:44.88
you need you need a pilot from the squadron to run the the amateness on a cuby point and

445
00:56:44.88 --> 00:56:50.72
Philippines you know a pilot stand behind it for battle damage and stuff you know it's I'll take

446
00:56:50.72 --> 00:56:55.76
here and I'll run those troops and for you I can do that on a crutch and so he said okay so

447
00:56:55.76 --> 00:57:02.32
he let me he let me off on on the Philippines and well the rest of the squadron you know went

448
00:57:02.32 --> 00:57:08.80
to the first line period they went out there and I'm cracking my way around the Philippines

449
00:57:10.08 --> 00:57:17.76
with you know I had probably six or eight chiefs and I had mechanics you know working

450
00:57:17.76 --> 00:57:23.20
on these airplanes well and so they would send these airplanes back to me but I didn't have

451
00:57:23.20 --> 00:57:30.48
any way to test them but the army a trip or hospital had not taken my wings they they they

452
00:57:30.48 --> 00:57:37.60
did not give me a down ship so I told me I couldn't fly you know so I talked to doctor

453
00:57:37.60 --> 00:57:45.12
there at the Subic Bay to put on a walking cast okay so I got a little cast and so I can you know

454
00:57:45.12 --> 00:57:50.96
I'm qualified to test these airplanes I can do this and so the problem was first of all I couldn't

455
00:57:50.96 --> 00:57:56.16
get into the airplane because my cast was too big to go into to the togo and so I'd have

456
00:57:56.16 --> 00:58:03.44
my crew fork lift me up and into the airplane my second problem was I couldn't use my right foot

457
00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:10.24
to push the right rudder and this is kind of a nose wheel steering airplane the F4 where you

458
00:58:10.24 --> 00:58:15.36
got to be able to push the rudder to steer so I would I'd go out and test these airplanes and I come

459
00:58:15.36 --> 00:58:21.68
back and land at at QB point and to fill the paints and instead of making they they'd say okay

460
00:58:21.68 --> 00:58:26.80
you're you're cleared right hand turn couldn't make a right hand turn I made three left hand turns

461
00:58:26.80 --> 00:58:34.24
to get off the line so the the squadron finally came back and and I got back with them got

462
00:58:34.24 --> 00:58:40.08
my little cast off and I started flying missions but until the day I was shot down I was still

463
00:58:40.08 --> 00:58:45.68
limping on that ankle and I was really afraid with a diet in the prison camp but that was never

464
00:58:45.68 --> 00:58:53.12
gonna heal but you know as as luck and and fate would have it it heal up fine and so you know

465
00:58:54.48 --> 00:58:59.36
but yeah that that's my story of I've get breaking my leg on the way to combat

466
00:59:01.20 --> 00:59:02.72
yeah thanks for bringing that up Jim

467
00:59:02.72 --> 00:59:10.80
you know let's let's do we're talking about now we're talking about getting shot down you know

468
00:59:10.80 --> 00:59:16.80
you're ended up in a prison camp let's you you were about to get to the to the engagement or you

469
00:59:16.80 --> 00:59:21.92
actually did get shot down you want to talk through that one a little bit further Jim and just

470
00:59:21.92 --> 00:59:33.76
give us some details on that. Well sure at some of the details are not original but back to the

471
00:59:35.36 --> 00:59:42.64
purple heart corner you spot them coming in again and this time there were two different

472
00:59:42.64 --> 00:59:48.56
gaggles that I could see and the gaggle is a word that we use for the Germans because they didn't

473
00:59:48.56 --> 00:59:55.44
fly a real tight formation they kind of they were just there was that was that intentional?

474
00:59:55.44 --> 01:00:01.36
yeah it must have been because they were you know the German pilots are sharp by him yeah but

475
01:00:01.36 --> 01:00:07.28
I would guess especially in Germans are generally orderly people so you'd think they'd want

476
01:00:07.28 --> 01:00:13.04
to fly tight formations but I guess if you think about it from a from like even from a basic

477
01:00:13.04 --> 01:00:17.44
camouflage perspective when you see things in a pattern it stands out more so maybe they did

478
01:00:17.44 --> 01:00:22.16
that to break up their pattern a little bit. Well I would assume that because they were very effective

479
01:00:23.04 --> 01:00:29.44
and you know some of these boys you we'd run into who had been out of for a long time

480
01:00:30.96 --> 01:00:38.80
but as I saw them coming in and as we'd forgive them as I said it's a gaggle I picked the one

481
01:00:38.80 --> 01:00:47.04
closest and broke into it made the call that I was making the break and broke and just as I

482
01:00:47.04 --> 01:00:53.92
broke somebody got a shot at me and I got hit back in the after all part of the few

483
01:00:53.92 --> 01:01:03.92
slides and I I thought I had a little fire going and I'm sure I did but as I made my first pass

484
01:01:03.92 --> 01:01:12.000
through them I lined up and if you could get the P38 nose on a target those four

485
01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:20.000
fifties in that 20 millimeter were devastated and 30 rounds of 50 cow would you have. We usually

486
01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:32.64
carry 400 rounds per gun and 130 rounds of 20 millimeter and we arranged our triggers so that

487
01:01:33.36 --> 01:01:39.28
we we want to fire them all at the same time we didn't carry any tracer we put five tracers in

488
01:01:39.28 --> 01:01:46.32
at about 25 rounds remaining so that you knew you were you had to have something to go home on

489
01:01:46.32 --> 01:01:57.44
the start conservative in your ammunition and so I got a line on a clear shot fire that

490
01:01:57.44 --> 01:02:01.92
in but I don't I didn't know what the results were because all of a sudden I'm in the middle of

491
01:02:01.92 --> 01:02:11.20
the fire storm a literal fire storm inside your cabinet inside your cockpit or just still outside

492
01:02:11.20 --> 01:02:17.52
the plane outside there were there were lots of targets and apparently I went through them

493
01:02:20.08 --> 01:02:31.76
really at this late day in my story it's how much I really remember about this I heard stories

494
01:02:31.76 --> 01:02:42.08
later which I'll get to but it seemed like it went on forever and finally I'm on the tail of

495
01:02:42.08 --> 01:02:50.64
a 190 I saw I saw some I knew I was involved with 190s but I saw a couple one-on-one lines

496
01:02:50.64 --> 01:02:56.32
someplace in my peripheral vision so there were there were other aircraft involved and they're

497
01:02:56.32 --> 01:03:05.76
out there apparently they're all with me I didn't know it at the time but we made a number of

498
01:03:06.64 --> 01:03:13.60
passes I was very concerned about the model of ammunition if you hold a fire button down

499
01:03:13.60 --> 01:03:20.08
you're gonna be out in about 20 seconds so I was very concerned about using all my ammunition

500
01:03:20.08 --> 01:03:28.96
so I was trying to fire very short bursts and we go around and round and we're enjoying up and down

501
01:03:30.96 --> 01:03:39.76
I got on the tail of a 190 again I'm right up on top of them and when the p38 through your

502
01:03:39.76 --> 01:03:47.76
gun sight you could also see your two top 50s and it looked like I had those two 50s right around

503
01:03:47.76 --> 01:03:55.92
the rudder post of this 190 and out of the corner of my eye I see these flashes out on my wing tip

504
01:03:55.92 --> 01:04:04.56
and they're coming up the wing tip and I get closer and closer and this is milliseconds and he

505
01:04:04.56 --> 01:04:16.80
hit me right in by the left engine and we had an air scoop that came in through the leading edge of the

506
01:04:16.80 --> 01:04:27.28
wing and into the cockpit by your left knee which is our only cold air into the p38 and again I see this

507
01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:35.68
peripheral vision and I'm concentrating on the guy in front of me I see this air vent making like a

508
01:04:35.68 --> 01:04:48.40
boat torch and so this is not good yeah again my next memory is I'm out falling through a cloud

509
01:04:49.52 --> 01:04:57.92
I don't remember our emergency relief was above us p38 had actually had windows and you crank them up

510
01:04:57.92 --> 01:05:05.60
on both sides and the only way you could get them down is to hit the little release and then crank them

511
01:05:05.60 --> 01:05:15.84
down and so we had a top hatch which was our escape hatch which is about this wide and you have a

512
01:05:15.84 --> 01:05:26.88
backpack shoe dawn and all your equipment and I don't know I don't remember releasing

513
01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:34.96
anything pulling the safety belt or the shoulder harnesses but this is

514
01:05:34.96 --> 01:05:40.16
unlike you know Charlie you're you know the modern rigs where you pull the ejection handle and you

515
01:05:40.16 --> 01:05:45.44
this is all stuff I mean in a modern aircraft you pull the ejection handle and you're getting

516
01:05:45.44 --> 01:05:51.28
shot out of the aircraft all automatic that's all that's all you do yeah we didn't have to think

517
01:05:51.28 --> 01:05:57.20
about anything we weren't smart as these guys were you so so this is all stuff you manually

518
01:05:57.20 --> 01:06:04.16
had to do unbuckled yourself get an open up the hatch or the window and and get all that done while

519
01:06:04.16 --> 01:06:09.36
the the plane is burning and and then you have to get out and that's kind of when you come back

520
01:06:09.36 --> 01:06:16.08
in a constant so you did that either instinctively or or at some point while all this mayhem was

521
01:06:16.08 --> 01:06:23.68
going on that's right I don't remember even reaching up above for the to pull the top hatch

522
01:06:25.52 --> 01:06:32.48
well I was just floating down to a I knew the clouds were around 5,000 feet because we've been

523
01:06:32.48 --> 01:06:39.28
you're you're an up and down during this time and also just one more point on a ejection sheet

524
01:06:39.28 --> 01:06:43.92
a modern ejection seat you come out your parachute opens automatically right oh yes so your

525
01:06:43.92 --> 01:06:48.56
you're still in a rip-cord scenario right we're you're gonna have to make this parachute open so

526
01:06:48.56 --> 01:06:52.88
when you say when you say you're floating down you're actually falling down at a hundred and

527
01:06:52.88 --> 01:06:59.44
twenty miles per hour towards the earth somewhat like that so anyway I come out to bottom of a

528
01:06:59.44 --> 01:07:09.20
cloud and I'm facing up and I thought well I better turn over so I turned over that I can remember

529
01:07:09.20 --> 01:07:14.40
to simply watching the ground and I thought I was behind German lines because we were a

530
01:07:14.40 --> 01:07:24.32
talking Germany and I had just knew that I was we were east of Wacke and I knew we're

531
01:07:24.32 --> 01:07:30.08
approximately where this bite started and I didn't think it had gotten any better about going

532
01:07:30.08 --> 01:07:41.36
west so I figured we were we were all different territory and so we we've been told to not pull

533
01:07:41.36 --> 01:07:51.20
your rip-cord that out to get down you're a lot less of target glory you can get so I rolled over

534
01:07:51.20 --> 01:07:56.80
and fell actually just fell face down and watched the ground come up when it looked like it was

535
01:07:56.80 --> 01:08:03.28
pretty close I pulled a rip-cord and this is your first time parachuting or did you guys do any

536
01:08:03.28 --> 01:08:13.04
parachuting in preparation for this? No no no okay yeah that's interesting having

537
01:08:13.04 --> 01:08:18.000
having jumped out of at least a decent number of airplanes this is not something you want to do

538
01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:35.92
for the first time you know I remember thinking well you know I got to be ready to move

539
01:08:35.92 --> 01:08:43.76
and when I get down so I unbuckled the two lower straps on the shoe and I got them unbuckled

540
01:08:43.76 --> 01:08:50.000
and I had a 45 in the shoulder holster I got to 45 out and I'm trying to cock it

541
01:08:51.12 --> 01:08:55.84
to get around in the chamber and I dropped it I didn't realize my hands were burned

542
01:08:56.72 --> 01:09:03.92
and so I'm not sure how I got the the shoot buckles up and so I must have been pretty low when I

543
01:09:03.92 --> 01:09:11.04
pulled a rip-cord because just instantaneously I came down in a red brick building

544
01:09:11.04 --> 01:09:20.24
and it had a courtyard and a tree in the middle of a courtyard and I could if I could find the building

545
01:09:20.24 --> 01:09:27.60
I'd recognize it today and my shoot caught in this little tree and I jerked to a stop and I'm

546
01:09:27.60 --> 01:09:36.000
probably six inches off the back and I remember doing that but then I don't remember

547
01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:50.56
for a period and I kept thinking it's getting dark and I thought I'm going down what I was like a

548
01:09:50.56 --> 01:10:00.56
little hedge row and I had my 45 and I saw these guys down in this ditch I thought they were German

549
01:10:00.56 --> 01:10:08.96
and I saw they had a net on their helmet and hard guys had net on the helmet and I threw my hands

550
01:10:08.96 --> 01:10:16.24
up through the 45 over my shoulder never saw it again but it was first infantry division

551
01:10:17.36 --> 01:10:25.28
and they had seen my shoot and I came down between the German positions and first infantry division

552
01:10:25.28 --> 01:10:32.96
and what had happened and I found this all later they first infantry we were trying to take

553
01:10:32.96 --> 01:10:39.44
off and you know we started and this is mid-September to try to take off and we didn't get

554
01:10:39.44 --> 01:10:48.64
off and until early November where we actually took the town and the first infantry had

555
01:10:48.64 --> 01:10:58.56
pushed up during on the night of the 15th had pushed up and taken this little area where I came down

556
01:10:58.56 --> 01:11:07.52
it was a little town called the Elendor which was a suburb of Bokken and they were having trouble

557
01:11:07.52 --> 01:11:16.80
holding it and so they were getting ready to pull back and they saw my shoot and the guys came out

558
01:11:16.80 --> 01:11:28.80
and picked me up to meet a back hospital but before they did that they took me in and into an area

559
01:11:28.80 --> 01:11:36.80
and I was in a command post and I met a full kernel and I found out later who he was he was

560
01:11:36.80 --> 01:11:44.64
the commander of the 16th infantry regiment and he said he asked me if you wanted to dinner and I said

561
01:11:44.64 --> 01:11:52.16
I don't know what I said anyway I apparently sit down and had dinner with him right with him and

562
01:11:53.44 --> 01:12:00.88
I do remember going outside this area and throwing me up so I knew I had eaten something but

563
01:12:01.84 --> 01:12:12.88
they put me on a two and a half toned truck and when they put the the stretchers they put them in

564
01:12:12.88 --> 01:12:20.48
between the what are the side gates and I there was some Germans in there and some Americans

565
01:12:20.48 --> 01:12:25.92
and me and they hauled a spank and I they took me to what I found out later was the 45th of

566
01:12:25.92 --> 01:12:37.36
back hospital and they treated me there but I'd write at that moment I don't remember too much

567
01:12:37.36 --> 01:12:42.80
about all this going on except I thought it was getting dark so I thought I'd been on the ground

568
01:12:42.80 --> 01:12:51.04
for quite a while and I found out later that my eyes were had been pretty flash burns in my face

569
01:12:51.04 --> 01:12:58.40
and hands and everything and I couldn't see for a couple of days so apparently I was having

570
01:12:58.40 --> 01:13:06.88
my eyes were swelling shut or something and I think it's getting dark but they hauled the

571
01:13:06.88 --> 01:13:14.88
end of the the the hospital and I was very fortunate they had a doctor there who

572
01:13:16.40 --> 01:13:22.56
either had developed or was using a new technique on burns and they took me in they

573
01:13:22.56 --> 01:13:29.68
this operating room and it's colder and hell and I'm vibrating like blazes and they start picking

574
01:13:29.68 --> 01:13:38.16
like this and kind of the old drive me crazy and what I wanted to say developed this new

575
01:13:38.16 --> 01:13:45.12
technique where they picked this all the burn areas out and they've to get it off there so you

576
01:13:45.12 --> 01:13:54.80
heal from from the inside out and as I went back through the the hospital system they used me as

577
01:13:54.80 --> 01:14:03.36
a demonstration to these kids that have been caught in tanks and badly burn what's worse than I was

578
01:14:04.16 --> 01:14:10.72
and they were telling them that look what we did here look how quickly he's healing me

579
01:14:12.48 --> 01:14:18.96
using this technique and so apparently I was one of the very first that they'd ever used this

580
01:14:18.96 --> 01:14:29.28
on but when we we were put on this train the hospital train and taken to the American hospital

581
01:14:29.28 --> 01:14:37.04
in Paris and they haul me in there and this guy comes up to me and he says hell I know you

582
01:14:38.48 --> 01:14:46.88
he says we picked you up and his name was Walter Leonard Scott he was with the first

583
01:14:46.88 --> 01:14:55.52
representative vision company C and he was the second lieutenant and he became my friend he stayed

584
01:14:55.52 --> 01:15:02.40
with me for quite a while and he had witnessed almost all of this operation as we yo-yoed around

585
01:15:02.40 --> 01:15:10.16
the area why he was seeing a good part and then he told me a lot about what happened they they told me

586
01:15:10.16 --> 01:15:18.000
that they estimated there were 20 and 20 enemy aircraft and that somehow or other that story has stuck

587
01:15:19.60 --> 01:15:32.64
with with my story I don't know what they were I mean he he actually was where I got most of my

588
01:15:32.64 --> 01:15:41.60
information about what had gone on so we we went through the hospital chain and you know what

589
01:15:41.60 --> 01:15:49.36
was he in the hospital for something had he been injured as well yeah he we get the England and he's

590
01:15:49.36 --> 01:15:56.64
telling me a little bit about infantry life and he had landed with the first infantry division

591
01:15:56.64 --> 01:16:08.32
in North Africa they went all through North Africa and went to Sicily and he had been very badly

592
01:16:08.32 --> 01:16:21.92
wounded in Sicily and they he and another officer had manned a man of tank gun in some big

593
01:16:21.92 --> 01:16:30.000
operation in Sicily and the two of them stayed with this antitank gun when everybody else

594
01:16:30.72 --> 01:16:39.04
had departed and anyway he had received a distinctly service cross and that was the first time I

595
01:16:39.04 --> 01:16:48.88
ever heard the turn distinctly service cross and so now I'm starting he started in 42 and he went through

596
01:16:48.88 --> 01:16:56.80
North Africa he went to Sicily he went to England he made D day and wow yeah I see well

597
01:16:57.76 --> 01:17:08.40
how come you're still a second lieutenant we we hadn't been in what we were sent to England they

598
01:17:08.40 --> 01:17:15.92
took us to the Nettley hospital which was this gigantic hospital right outside of South Hampton

599
01:17:15.92 --> 01:17:26.24
that had been built in the war wars something like that big look like a castle and so we hadn't been

600
01:17:26.24 --> 01:17:35.12
in their two hours and this cute little nurse shows up with a class a uniform for Leonard Scott

601
01:17:35.84 --> 01:17:45.68
and Scott was gone I mean we didn't see him for 10 days so I figured it's Leonard Scott

602
01:17:45.68 --> 01:17:52.72
was probably a first lieutenant four or five times it sounds like from the cuteness it might have been

603
01:17:52.72 --> 01:18:04.72
worth it sure but you know we we were quite close for just a few weeks and for years and years

604
01:18:04.72 --> 01:18:10.40
and years I tried to find Leonard Scott I knew that he made it through the war I knew that

605
01:18:10.40 --> 01:18:17.44
he'd gotten all separated from active duty and at Fort Lewis and he was from the Dalsor

606
01:18:17.44 --> 01:18:24.56
I didn't and I tried to find him and about a year ago my wife said down at the computer

607
01:18:25.28 --> 01:18:34.56
in an amount of a couple hours she finds his two his two daughters and he had passed

608
01:18:34.56 --> 01:18:40.64
he'd gone through Korea went back on active duty went through Korea he was

609
01:18:42.80 --> 01:18:47.84
he had just this thing we service cross he had the purple heart with seven clusters

610
01:18:48.80 --> 01:18:56.72
and he had been hit he said he made the D.D landing and in 20 minutes he was on a

611
01:18:59.12 --> 01:19:03.36
landing craft on his way back to England he's gotten hit that quickly

612
01:19:03.36 --> 01:19:10.40
and then he the day after I was shot down he got hit again and he went back

613
01:19:11.60 --> 01:19:17.36
after we separated he went back to the first infantry division company see

614
01:19:18.64 --> 01:19:30.40
and it's funny coming up to more recent times I built a number I used to build

615
01:19:30.40 --> 01:19:36.80
and we're still building airport facilities but I used to build air cargo buildings and so forth

616
01:19:36.80 --> 01:19:43.92
and leasing to the airlines and I did a lot of work with flying tigers and I knew Bob

617
01:19:43.92 --> 01:19:48.40
Prescott pretty well who was the president of tigers and they who

618
01:19:50.32 --> 01:19:54.48
Wayne Hoffman who was the chairman of the board of tigers so tell us a little bit about the

619
01:19:54.48 --> 01:19:58.72
flying tigers if people don't know the flying tigers in the airline

620
01:19:58.72 --> 01:20:05.76
cargo airline that was sold to federal express then is now part of federal express

621
01:20:06.48 --> 01:20:14.24
and tigers was named because Bob Prescott he was president of tigers had flown with the

622
01:20:14.24 --> 01:20:22.24
flying tiger organization in China one of the original flying tigers and right after the war he

623
01:20:22.24 --> 01:20:27.76
started a little airline called it flying tigers and it became a gigantic

624
01:20:27.76 --> 01:20:35.60
air cargo facility and they were flying all over the world and so I started building facilities

625
01:20:35.60 --> 01:20:42.000
and leasing to them and so the new Bob and the new Wayne Hoffman were well and I knew that Wayne

626
01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:49.92
Hoffman had been in the army and been in the infantry but that's we never talked about them

627
01:20:49.92 --> 01:21:03.76
and Wayne's wife wrote a book and she took all of Wayne's letters that he had written home

628
01:21:03.76 --> 01:21:11.20
from Europe during the war and put them in this book and so they gave me a book and I read it

629
01:21:11.20 --> 01:21:19.84
and I come to September 16th Wayne Hoffman is an Ellen Dorf Germany in the first

630
01:21:19.84 --> 01:21:27.12
part of the SIGFRIED line five o'clock in the evening in his letter to his wife he said

631
01:21:27.12 --> 01:21:36.32
in a very short letter he said in the Eleanor and there's an airbile going on above us

632
01:21:37.44 --> 01:21:45.92
and we get talking and that was me then here we've been friends for a number of years and we'd

633
01:21:45.92 --> 01:21:54.000
never really talked about it and he was company D of the 16th regiment and when it's got

634
01:21:54.000 --> 01:22:04.72
was company C of the 16th regiment and we never put all this together that's it's amazing what comes

635
01:22:04.72 --> 01:22:12.08
out and I found out that two of the people on the German side that I've been involved with

636
01:22:12.08 --> 01:22:23.36
a current major Boris this is a long story I don't know how far do you want to go with

637
01:22:23.36 --> 01:22:27.36
we go as long as you want to talk

638
01:22:27.68 --> 01:22:38.72
they major Boris allowed to go back and step I heard from a gentleman in Holland

639
01:22:38.72 --> 01:22:48.56
and they had some information about my airplane and this gentleman had written several

640
01:22:49.52 --> 01:22:57.84
big historical books and he lived in that little area where Belgium and Holland and Germany

641
01:22:57.84 --> 01:23:06.56
all come together and he had found like 500 wrecks aircraft wrecks in this area and

642
01:23:06.56 --> 01:23:16.16
traced them down in the history and recorded it and they came up with a P38 in

643
01:23:17.28 --> 01:23:26.88
Elendorf Germany and so they figured out and found it was my airplane and they found it in

644
01:23:26.88 --> 01:23:34.64
1997 and so anyway in the series of steps I didn't they get in contact with me and

645
01:23:34.64 --> 01:23:46.32
he had studied that air warfare in that area and was writing another book about that

646
01:23:46.32 --> 01:23:52.72
and he said what you want to talk to me about and we did but unfortunately he passed away

647
01:23:53.44 --> 01:24:02.40
but very early he was a young man and so I never got a sooner from the record my airplane

648
01:24:02.40 --> 01:24:09.04
it's there someplace waiting for me to find it but he told me that he came up with two

649
01:24:09.04 --> 01:24:21.04
names that he had read this book by Callwell there's a story called the War Dary of JG26

650
01:24:21.04 --> 01:24:33.36
the Elendorf's Abby Vullboy's Elendorf aircraft and they he had written on September

651
01:24:33.36 --> 01:24:43.12
16 he had the story about attacking the three these three seven years group and the Germans claimed

652
01:24:43.12 --> 01:24:53.20
4 p38s had been shot down and that wasn't true I was the only one that lost they actually attacked

653
01:24:53.20 --> 01:24:58.56
the group after my engagement with them they finally got their act together I guess in the

654
01:24:58.56 --> 01:25:05.20
attack the group and didn't do too well like 20 minutes 30 minutes later whatever the time

655
01:25:05.20 --> 01:25:11.92
of them but he figured out that one of two people had shot me down one fellow was major

656
01:25:11.92 --> 01:25:20.96
Boris major Boris had shot down his first victory was 1939 he shot down the spitfire

657
01:25:22.16 --> 01:25:30.96
he had if he got me I was his 40 second victory the other guy was a no follow by the name of Keith

658
01:25:30.96 --> 01:25:45.20
Miela and he he got me I would have been his 80 second so these guys were not beginners and so all this

659
01:25:46.24 --> 01:25:54.48
information is dribbling in over the last 60 years so by the time I find out about Boris and

660
01:25:54.48 --> 01:26:04.000
the lift wapa they've died so I've never got a chance to talk but but through Scott we found

661
01:26:04.72 --> 01:26:14.16
Scott's daughter is a very famous interior decorator in San Francisco and so we're going to get

662
01:26:14.16 --> 01:26:21.04
together with her and she said that her father passed away at very early a I think he was in these

663
01:26:21.04 --> 01:26:29.84
50s but so all of this keeps coming in we keep in there more and more if I'm something

664
01:26:29.84 --> 01:26:38.16
old accidentally be on earth to her interesting stories are Jim but you haven't told us about the nurse

665
01:26:38.16 --> 01:26:51.44
up and you with your clothes all the nurse this is a g-rated podcast most of the time

666
01:26:53.76 --> 01:27:00.80
another echo can you know bleep it somewhere down there were some lovely nurses

667
01:27:00.80 --> 01:27:09.92
and I think we all know what happened they were you know they were so wonderful I mean these

668
01:27:09.92 --> 01:27:15.60
gals were just unbelievable how they took care of you know it's actually you know we've read

669
01:27:15.60 --> 01:27:19.36
some books on the podcast where there is nurses that were over in France and they were receiving

670
01:27:19.36 --> 01:27:27.68
guys right off the front lines yeah well they they had me on this 45th and I wake up and I'm here in

671
01:27:27.68 --> 01:27:34.88
all of this big bang and going on well the 45th hospital is here and there's a right behind

672
01:27:34.88 --> 01:27:48.24
there here there's a 105 or 105 artillery fire and over the hospital and they took me to from there I

673
01:27:48.24 --> 01:27:58.88
went to the hospital the general hospital in Brussels no not Brussels were there a man mastery

674
01:27:59.76 --> 01:28:11.44
and I left there one day and then the next day after I left be one rock rocket me

675
01:28:11.44 --> 01:28:20.64
right into the side of the hospital and I have pictures of it that I took this is later my second

676
01:28:20.64 --> 01:28:28.88
tour through the hospital which was another story but so that that was a big tragedy

677
01:28:28.88 --> 01:28:36.40
I killed a number of the people in one of the wards so and and those those were nurses that I knew

678
01:28:36.40 --> 01:28:43.44
but how long did it take you to recover and did you fly again or was that was being shot down

679
01:28:43.44 --> 01:28:51.84
and wounded was at the end of the war for you? No well it was in combat really I went through the

680
01:28:51.84 --> 01:29:05.20
hospital chain and I was released in England and went back I was going through Paris and you know

681
01:29:06.88 --> 01:29:14.08
when the hospitals would collect the uniforms they took all my flying jacket and everything was

682
01:29:14.08 --> 01:29:19.92
burned from the red so it's all they stripped you down throw it all away and so now I'm in a

683
01:29:19.92 --> 01:29:24.56
hospital in England and they're gonna release me and I'm going back to my squadron I'm very

684
01:29:24.56 --> 01:29:35.52
to fly this is in November and my burns had healed pretty well and so they give me a uniform

685
01:29:36.56 --> 01:29:44.56
to wear and I don't know how many guys or how many times if sky whoever's uniform it was it

686
01:29:44.56 --> 01:29:53.44
been hit but there was a sure a bunch of holes in it and I found a hat and so I had no money

687
01:29:54.24 --> 01:30:02.000
and so I'm I'm freaking my way back I went to London and then I got to flight the Paris and I got

688
01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:06.88
the Paris and so I decided well I'm in Paris and I'm on my way back the squadron

689
01:30:06.88 --> 01:30:17.20
I'm gonna see something so I went down to the leado club and I used to like I'd still like to dance

690
01:30:17.84 --> 01:30:25.20
but I like swing and so I'm in the leado club and and they have this pretty little gal singing

691
01:30:27.28 --> 01:30:33.52
some French tunes and then they want to they ask the few people if they wanted to do a little

692
01:30:33.52 --> 01:30:44.40
jar of bug so we had quite the night and so I left early and I'm figuring on where I'm going to sleep

693
01:30:46.32 --> 01:30:54.000
I'm walking down the avenue and here comes a gaggle like a hint of the guys with pinks on and

694
01:30:55.28 --> 01:31:02.40
the green jersey's and everything damn here comes my battle jacket my pants these are all

695
01:31:02.40 --> 01:31:10.96
friends of mine and there were in my clothes so I thought there were staying at the

696
01:31:10.96 --> 01:31:17.92
Clary's hotel right next to the leado club so all of a sudden I'm better dressed

697
01:31:21.04 --> 01:31:26.88
I borrowed some money and we enjoyed Paris and then did you get back to the squadron

698
01:31:26.88 --> 01:31:33.52
went back to the squadron with them and they had transportation so I went back with them and I'm there

699
01:31:33.52 --> 01:31:41.44
for a guy I walked in and everybody's glad to see me and and let's say Kylie just got a brand new

700
01:31:41.44 --> 01:31:50.000
P38 in right from Ireland just came through and she was and boy it was a beauty so I'm already

701
01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:56.64
to start flying again and Doc Berg who was our flight just comes to me and he says Jimmy says I don't

702
01:31:56.64 --> 01:32:03.52
like the way you're walking and I said well I'm just a little bit sore but everything's fine and

703
01:32:03.52 --> 01:32:09.68
he said well we're going over this we were at a 78 at that time for end's Belgium

704
01:32:10.40 --> 01:32:15.84
since we're going over the shallow run and just check yeah I'm so I go over the hospital with

705
01:32:15.84 --> 01:32:23.12
Charlie while with him and the next so you knew I got a cast from here down to my ran and they

706
01:32:23.12 --> 01:32:33.12
x-rayed me and and I had a broken back that they hadn't treated so back to the hospital

707
01:32:34.16 --> 01:32:44.64
and so I went through that and back to third military well they had them what they did

708
01:32:44.64 --> 01:32:52.56
they had a central medical section and they run all the pilots through there and then they

709
01:32:52.56 --> 01:32:57.60
would determine what happens to you and so I kept saying well I want to go back to the squadron

710
01:32:58.56 --> 01:33:04.48
and so they said okay we're going to you got your cast and they took the big cast off and put

711
01:33:04.48 --> 01:33:10.56
a small one on and say we're going to send you to England for at least 30 days to a flycouse

712
01:33:10.56 --> 01:33:23.60
well flycouses were they run by the red cross and mainly were for bomber crews if the

713
01:33:24.24 --> 01:33:31.20
bomber crew had been getting a little nervous of something that sent them down for a week or so

714
01:33:31.92 --> 01:33:38.56
so they sent me to this black house and the first thing I get in trouble with with the red cross

715
01:33:38.56 --> 01:33:46.08
is this fighter pilot it's like to talk about combat and flying the bomber guys didn't want to have

716
01:33:46.08 --> 01:33:52.56
anything to do with that kind of conversation so the red cross gets upset with me and they told me

717
01:33:52.56 --> 01:33:57.60
I got to keep my mouth shut and I said well fine I'll keep my mouth shut but I'm going to do this

718
01:33:58.56 --> 01:34:07.20
give me a set of orders and I'll go off to some base because I'm I can walk so I had a little plan

719
01:34:07.20 --> 01:34:16.88
used to get your flying time your pay you had to fly four hours a month so I would have I'd

720
01:34:16.88 --> 01:34:26.08
write a set of orders and said that I just temporary duty and I want four hours of

721
01:34:26.08 --> 01:34:37.44
flying time so I'd go off to some base and with with a small cast on and I'd say I'd walk in and

722
01:34:37.44 --> 01:34:43.60
say here's my orders I need four hours flying time so they'd arrange it not fly for four hours

723
01:34:43.60 --> 01:34:51.28
and go back to the flycouse in a couple days later I'd write some more orders and go someplace else

724
01:34:51.28 --> 01:34:58.24
so I got to fly a number of aircraft well I was there and so pretty soon my 30 days are over I

725
01:34:58.24 --> 01:35:06.88
get back to third minute medical and they sent me back to the squadron you know Godkberg was not

726
01:35:06.88 --> 01:35:15.28
happy to see me at all and at that time I got orders to report to General Spotshead quarters and

727
01:35:15.28 --> 01:35:24.000
in Paris and they said they didn't tell me what I was going down there for and some Colonel came

728
01:35:24.88 --> 01:35:30.56
came to the squadron he's also assigned on the same deal same set of orders and so we go down to

729
01:35:30.56 --> 01:35:39.20
Paris together and his name was in Galito and he ended up two or three star general but he had

730
01:35:39.20 --> 01:35:47.68
decorations from his neck down to his waist already and so I get down to Paris and I'm going to

731
01:35:47.68 --> 01:35:54.80
get the distinct reservist cross well outside of Leonard's squad we never really told me what the

732
01:35:54.80 --> 01:36:04.80
distinct reservist cross was I wasn't sure what we were about to get and anyway we got that and

733
01:36:04.80 --> 01:36:11.12
went back to the squadron again thinking everything at least is pretty close to right and the

734
01:36:11.12 --> 01:36:20.64
berg says you're going home and so that was the end of that except I'm grounded and that's

735
01:36:20.64 --> 01:36:26.96
why I'm going home I'm grounded so I had I had all these records with me and you know we

736
01:36:26.96 --> 01:36:34.32
officers then I suppose they still do you carry your own records with you so I'm going home

737
01:36:34.32 --> 01:36:42.40
grounded now I got my records well I still have those records and they're in a footwalker down in my

738
01:36:42.40 --> 01:36:53.76
hangar nobody else ever got I got home and took a medical and passed it and so I'm back on flying

739
01:36:53.76 --> 01:37:03.44
it towards the lawn looks like we could might be going to the out to the Pacific to make the

740
01:37:03.44 --> 01:37:15.60
invasion to plan I'm flying the latest P51 P51 age got married and with my childhood sweetheart

741
01:37:15.60 --> 01:37:24.80
do I met when she was 15 and everything is right in the world and Harry Drooman dropped the bomb and

742
01:37:25.60 --> 01:37:38.32
ruined a perfect good war so that was just about it I stayed in until 1948 and I got to

743
01:37:38.32 --> 01:37:45.76
apply our first jets and had a wonderful time had a wonderful experience learned a heck of a lot

744
01:37:46.72 --> 01:37:54.16
we got to do things that would have never happened to me and if we hadn't had gotten involved in all of

745
01:37:54.16 --> 01:38:03.36
this so work that great and so how did you to end up meeting? Well I had this old antique airplane

746
01:38:03.36 --> 01:38:10.32
and I was looking for a hanger for this airplane and Jim was building hangers at the time and this

747
01:38:10.32 --> 01:38:15.92
little bit of airport up in the valley above Santa Barbara called Santinez and he helped me

748
01:38:16.64 --> 01:38:26.72
build a hanger and it was kind of interesting the attraction and in fact my wife brought this up

749
01:38:26.72 --> 01:38:31.04
me said she said you know you're going to have three generations of warriors talking on these

750
01:38:31.04 --> 01:38:38.32
telephone I mean today on the spotcast you get Jim Kunkle on 30 years later you got Charlie Pum

751
01:38:38.32 --> 01:38:47.04
30 years later you got Jack O'Wink he said there's a certain attraction with warriors I don't know

752
01:38:47.04 --> 01:38:52.88
what it is with our brains you know but there's some kind of a kind of a magnetism or something

753
01:38:52.88 --> 01:38:59.04
you just got identified with a guy that had been in combat and so even though they're probably

754
01:38:59.04 --> 01:39:06.48
100 pilots on this airport and Jim and I kind of hit it off without even knowing our history

755
01:39:07.84 --> 01:39:12.16
and the more we got to know each other this is like 20 years ago the more we got to know each other

756
01:39:12.16 --> 01:39:20.64
the more similar philosophies of life you know we had and so it's not just our flying because

757
01:39:20.64 --> 01:39:26.48
Jim still flies of course I still fly and of course I've got an old antique airplane that

758
01:39:26.48 --> 01:39:37.20
from his training days and but more than that the technology has changed the the enemy has changed

759
01:39:38.48 --> 01:39:47.60
from World War II to Vietnam to Iraq you know but the camaraderie of military guys you know

760
01:39:47.60 --> 01:39:53.92
that there's just something and a lot of stuff that you talk about Jack O in your podcast and

761
01:39:53.92 --> 01:40:02.000
then your books just the you know the fact that we're all accountable we're responsible not just

762
01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:09.28
for our lives with for our buddies and something about that that community of warriors that really

763
01:40:09.28 --> 01:40:16.96
connects so that's how Jim and I got started to be built to hang her for me and and I moved in my wife

764
01:40:16.96 --> 01:40:24.80
made a man cave out of it so I mean that's where we're we're here doing this yeah that was

765
01:40:24.80 --> 01:40:29.60
we we joke about that on the first time you were on the podcast that that you had the ultimate man

766
01:40:29.60 --> 01:40:33.84
cave and you know I kind of threw that out there but now that I've been here it is actually

767
01:40:33.84 --> 01:40:38.96
factually true that you do have the ultimate man cave and I'm going to take a gop and take a

768
01:40:38.96 --> 01:40:42.80
bunch of pictures maybe we'll even do a video like a little tour of it and just show everyone

769
01:40:42.80 --> 01:40:49.12
kind of what this is all about and and all the I mean the history that you have here and the

770
01:40:49.12 --> 01:40:54.48
pictures and the photographs and the you know pieces of aircraft and everything else is it's

771
01:40:54.48 --> 01:41:02.24
its phenomenal to look at and you know it's interesting so when I got here you know we're walking

772
01:41:02.24 --> 01:41:08.16
around and and Jim's hangers a few hangers down and you know you said hey Jim wants to show you

773
01:41:08.16 --> 01:41:13.36
something and and I said oh well you know okay you know I didn't really have any idea what it was

774
01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:19.20
so we we get out and we walk from your hanger and we're walking down towards Jim's hanger

775
01:41:19.84 --> 01:41:25.68
and you know we shake hands and I meet Jim for the first time and he says you know I want to show

776
01:41:25.68 --> 01:41:31.60
you something and I say oh okay you know neat and he goes it's a picture and I said oh awesome

777
01:41:31.60 --> 01:41:38.96
and I have no idea what to expect and he says it's someone you know and I said okay well that

778
01:41:38.96 --> 01:41:44.72
narrowes it down but I don't know you know I don't know who I have in common you know with Jim or

779
01:41:44.72 --> 01:41:50.24
I don't know I have no idea who this was over this picture was going to be so we go to

780
01:41:51.20 --> 01:41:58.000
Jim's man cave which is in each equally impressive and awesome you know hanger with you know

781
01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:03.52
his personal facts and pictures and models and parts of aircraft and everything else and he walks

782
01:42:03.52 --> 01:42:09.84
into a corner and and he picks up a picture and he hands me this picture and the picture I

783
01:42:09.84 --> 01:42:16.000
immediately I know who it is and it's it's this second lieutenant from the Marine Corps it's a picture

784
01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:23.60
of a young Chinese American second lieutenant from the Marine Corps and it's it's currently

785
01:42:23.60 --> 01:42:32.64
who I I talked about in podcast number 53 colder than hell and I I went kind of off about him

786
01:42:32.64 --> 01:42:37.36
a little bit I talked about him a lot because if you remember from this particular podcast

787
01:42:37.36 --> 01:42:44.32
and from that particular book this was at the chosen reservoir and and this second lieutenant

788
01:42:44.32 --> 01:42:51.92
currently he was while of these guys are engaged in just intense continuous combat

789
01:42:51.92 --> 01:43:02.32
in order to lead his men he fashioned a fluorescent orange vest out of some signaling material

790
01:43:02.32 --> 01:43:06.72
and or out of some parachute material or something he made this vest for himself so that he would

791
01:43:06.72 --> 01:43:12.64
be completely visible to all of his men now that also means he's obviously completely visible to

792
01:43:12.64 --> 01:43:18.08
the enemy as well but that was what kind of a leader that this guy was you look I'm going to take

793
01:43:18.08 --> 01:43:23.36
extra us but I'm where I'm going to make this happen I'm in charge going to know where I am and you

794
01:43:23.36 --> 01:43:31.20
can follow me through whatever and it's an incredible story of heroism so that's the picture

795
01:43:31.20 --> 01:43:38.56
that Jim puts in front of me is this picture of of currently and I kind of look at him and I you know

796
01:43:38.56 --> 01:43:46.64
and and it turns out that you that you knew currently yesterday Kirk was a good friend of dear friend

797
01:43:46.64 --> 01:43:56.000
and quite a story and I had tremendous respect for him I have tremendous respect for his principles

798
01:43:56.56 --> 01:44:05.92
to the last day of the before he died and uh fond memories yeah it was it's an interesting story too

799
01:44:05.92 --> 01:44:10.000
because that's another thing that we talked about was in part of that what he did at one point in

800
01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:15.12
that book and I don't remember it specifically but he basically dresses someone down in the middle

801
01:44:15.12 --> 01:44:20.64
of a firefight for not giving him you know not calling him sir or not calling him lieutenant and

802
01:44:20.64 --> 01:44:23.76
you know I'm kind of saying hey guys you know you need to think about when the right type to do this

803
01:44:23.76 --> 01:44:31.04
is but as you said he was an extremely principled person and kept those principles at all times

804
01:44:31.76 --> 01:44:41.12
well you know he he led the group of Marines through the night to really fox company which is quite

805
01:44:41.12 --> 01:44:50.56
a well-known story in the Marine Corps. Buck Company was holding a hill that commanded the

806
01:44:50.56 --> 01:45:02.88
escape route for the whole chosen reservoir group army uh Marine Corps and they they were under heavy

807
01:45:02.88 --> 01:45:11.12
attack and the idea was to get down and support them and currently I could speak three or four

808
01:45:11.12 --> 01:45:17.36
different dialects of Chinese and so he's leading these he's the scout who was actually

809
01:45:17.36 --> 01:45:22.96
leading the whole contingent of Marines through the night through heavy snow

810
01:45:22.96 --> 01:45:33.92
terrible terrible conditions and actually as they came across Chinese centuries troops

811
01:45:34.56 --> 01:45:41.28
he would talk to them in Chinese and they got the whole whole contingent got through

812
01:45:42.40 --> 01:45:49.20
and they made it in time they relieved fox company tremendous story.

813
01:45:49.20 --> 01:45:56.72
It is unbelievable story and unbelievable that you handed that picture to me and that you knew

814
01:45:56.72 --> 01:46:03.68
him I mean that's just this phenomenal phenomenal situation. Was there anything Charlie that

815
01:46:03.68 --> 01:46:09.28
when when you were on last time was there anything that you know I know we we talked for a few hours I

816
01:46:09.28 --> 01:46:15.12
think. Yeah we did. Yeah. Was there any major things that as you listened to it again that you said to yourself

817
01:46:15.12 --> 01:46:21.92
you know what I should I should talk about this as well. Not nothing that which specifically comes

818
01:46:21.92 --> 01:46:29.44
to mind but now that you know that the three warriors are here together you know I think we should

819
01:46:29.44 --> 01:46:35.44
talk a little bit about philosophies of combat and the fears that we faced because I think you know

820
01:46:35.44 --> 01:46:41.68
to the general public the vast majority of your listeners and viewers are not in the military

821
01:46:41.68 --> 01:46:48.48
and so you know my my thought is well how do they relate oh it's interesting history you know

822
01:46:48.48 --> 01:46:54.48
I love the history of the greater generation and I love your history as well and the things

823
01:46:54.48 --> 01:47:01.04
that are going on today that the guys at the point of the spear but what does that mean to the

824
01:47:01.04 --> 01:47:07.36
you know to the average guy you know who's never been in the military there's some principles I

825
01:47:07.36 --> 01:47:14.000
believe that the three of us learned in combat that can that's transferable I think to to all

826
01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:20.56
challenges of life you know that just you know the fact that you face your fears you know you step

827
01:47:20.56 --> 01:47:27.84
into the and to the box and and gymbed it and you've done it where you you could have run the other way

828
01:47:27.84 --> 01:47:34.88
you know you you could have quit you could have checked out but you know I mean all all three of us

829
01:47:34.88 --> 01:47:41.36
felt like that we had a duty a duty to our country to duty to our brotherhood and so we you know

830
01:47:41.36 --> 01:47:49.36
picked up the you know picked up the baton and and continued on and so you know to me that's sort of

831
01:47:49.36 --> 01:47:55.68
the important part the part that you can you can transfer more than just the military history that we all

832
01:47:55.68 --> 01:48:03.20
have the the philosophy of meeting challenges because I'm convinced you know you can you can you can

833
01:48:03.20 --> 01:48:09.76
be in just as much of a challenge in your life you don't you don't have to be flying jet airplanes

834
01:48:09.76 --> 01:48:17.84
or running around the seal teams you can face challenges when a person is diagnosed with cancer

835
01:48:17.84 --> 01:48:23.12
or loses a child or for that matter gets cut out of your land on the freeway you have a choice

836
01:48:23.92 --> 01:48:31.92
and and the choice that you make that certainly depends on not only your character but then it also

837
01:48:31.92 --> 01:48:39.36
transmit into the outcome of the character that you continue to be in life and so while we're

838
01:48:40.08 --> 01:48:48.24
you know thirty sixty years apart in our in our generations here are philosophies of life and the warrior

839
01:48:50.08 --> 01:48:57.76
psyche continues and so I'm just really really proud to be a part of this and proud to be

840
01:48:57.76 --> 01:49:03.84
with you jockel and of course with you Jim Jim and I see each other probably a couple times a

841
01:49:03.84 --> 01:49:11.84
month we get together we have dinner our wives you know cook good meals and we go fly sometimes

842
01:49:11.84 --> 01:49:20.64
and and there's a certain silent language I think between us that we don't even have to talk to

843
01:49:20.64 --> 01:49:26.08
each other and yet we understand what what's going on you know where we're coming from

844
01:49:26.08 --> 01:49:32.80
and the accountability that we share just because of the experiences that we've had

845
01:49:34.96 --> 01:49:39.20
I got asked the question the other day I was working with a company I was actually

846
01:49:39.20 --> 01:49:44.48
know it's in the court with a company I was doing a speech and I was doing some Q&A at the end

847
01:49:44.48 --> 01:49:53.92
and a guy asked me how do you define character and how do you build it and I'd actually never

848
01:49:53.92 --> 01:49:58.32
been asked this question before and quite frankly I hadn't really thought about it very much

849
01:49:58.32 --> 01:50:03.04
and this guy had to thought about it and I talked to him afterwards and it was something that

850
01:50:03.60 --> 01:50:08.64
he was why he really wanted to hear me talk because he wanted to get my perspective on this

851
01:50:10.08 --> 01:50:22.72
and I answered the question like this I said you know for me character is not a very complex thing

852
01:50:22.72 --> 01:50:33.68
for me character is you do what's right you do what's right you do the right thing that's what

853
01:50:33.68 --> 01:50:40.000
you do and if you do the right thing regardless of what the consequences are that represents

854
01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:46.48
character and so then how do you build character it's a beautiful thing because it's the same thing

855
01:50:46.48 --> 01:50:51.04
if you want to build character you do the right thing you do the right thing for yourself you do

856
01:50:51.04 --> 01:50:55.52
the right thing for your family you do the right thing for the people that you know you do the right

857
01:50:55.52 --> 01:51:00.24
thing for your community you do the right thing for your country that's what you do and now on an

858
01:51:00.24 --> 01:51:06.16
individual level those things are hard things often right if those are hard things you have to make

859
01:51:06.16 --> 01:51:12.32
the right decisions you have to live a disciplined life those build character those little things

860
01:51:12.32 --> 01:51:18.88
that you do on a daily basis to make yourself better to improve your health to improve your

861
01:51:18.88 --> 01:51:25.60
your situation in life you're doing those things they're hard to do and when you do those things

862
01:51:25.60 --> 01:51:30.80
they build your character and ultimately they lead to your your your your character being a good

863
01:51:30.80 --> 01:51:35.12
character as opposed to a bad one but I've never been asked that question before and I thought that

864
01:51:35.12 --> 01:51:40.56
the simplicity of it is pretty clear when you think about it you know when you think about the

865
01:51:40.56 --> 01:51:44.40
people that you know you know when I think about the the people that I worked for in the military

866
01:51:44.40 --> 01:51:50.16
or that worked for me up or down the chain of command what what is it that made them people that

867
01:51:50.16 --> 01:51:53.60
because you know there's bad care you know we we can't sit here and pretend like everybody that's

868
01:51:53.60 --> 01:51:57.04
just because you're in the military you've got great character that's absolutely not true

869
01:51:57.04 --> 01:52:01.84
but what about those people and I you know I thought through this in in three seconds as this guy

870
01:52:01.84 --> 01:52:05.60
asked me this question you know I thought to myself what about the guys that I know that have

871
01:52:05.60 --> 01:52:10.88
good character that I look to and say yeah this this person I trust you know without question

872
01:52:10.88 --> 01:52:14.48
what kind of person is that that's the person that you know is going to do the right thing all the

873
01:52:14.48 --> 01:52:21.28
time regardless of the consequences and a couple of things about that first of all it isn't easy

874
01:52:21.28 --> 01:52:26.48
in fact usually the right thing is the toughest thing you know it it's the it's the hard decision

875
01:52:26.48 --> 01:52:31.84
the second thing is it doesn't always turn out for the best we need to do the right thing lots

876
01:52:31.84 --> 01:52:37.92
of times we stumble you know and and your listeners may think that the three of us you know have always

877
01:52:37.92 --> 01:52:44.000
you know been on the top of the heap but all three of us have fallen short you know I mean

878
01:52:44.96 --> 01:52:50.56
I'll tell you this languishing then prison camp the first the first month in that prison camp I

879
01:52:50.56 --> 01:52:59.20
laid there in in in in blood and sweat and tears and and my mental state was just in the tank

880
01:52:59.20 --> 01:53:04.48
because I'd given up fighter pilots are not supposed to give up Jim and I weren't trained to

881
01:53:04.48 --> 01:53:11.76
surrender and my mental but the depression that I had just because of that and I think that

882
01:53:11.76 --> 01:53:18.24
largely in life you know when you do do the right thing and it doesn't turn out right then you

883
01:53:18.24 --> 01:53:26.24
have to get up dust yourself off get back in the back in the in the fray and that's tough to do you

884
01:53:26.24 --> 01:53:32.88
know the last thing you want to do when when when you're getting beat up every from every side

885
01:53:32.88 --> 01:53:38.88
and you really want to quit the last thing you want to do is to is to stand up and be forceful again

886
01:53:38.88 --> 01:53:46.000
to you know to to take control of the situation and yet it's those kinds of challenges in life

887
01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:51.52
that build that character you know that that really make the difference between you know that

888
01:53:52.72 --> 01:54:00.88
the the positive life the life lived well and those guys and gals that that don't make those

889
01:54:00.88 --> 01:54:08.32
kind of decisions and you're talking about when you were when you were depressed when you were laying

890
01:54:08.32 --> 01:54:13.76
there it's because you felt like you had failed right you felt like you had broken you felt like you

891
01:54:13.76 --> 01:54:21.28
weren't the man that you thought you were and they'd found your breaking point and you'd found your

892
01:54:21.28 --> 01:54:29.36
breaking point and you didn't like that and what if I remember correctly what what got you through that

893
01:54:29.36 --> 01:54:34.96
was you know you you went broke down and to go into your point of your cell mates and said well this

894
01:54:34.96 --> 01:54:42.24
is horrible I'm a disaster I'm a failure I broke and he kind of said oh yeah welcome to the club

895
01:54:42.24 --> 01:54:47.20
we all break it was like one of those things and I think to your point absolutely

896
01:54:48.96 --> 01:54:55.44
everyone everyone has a point where they go ah you know I I I failed to hear I didn't do what I was

897
01:54:55.44 --> 01:55:01.36
supposed to do I lacked the character that I needed at that time to to be a good leader or to

898
01:55:01.36 --> 01:55:07.12
even stand up and fight one more time I failed and the point is also sitting around at this table

899
01:55:07.12 --> 01:55:12.000
and every single person that's listening to this right now you can find a spot in your life where

900
01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:17.44
you said you know what I didn't do it I didn't hold the line I my character broke and I wasn't

901
01:55:17.44 --> 01:55:22.40
the person that I should have been at that moment and that's that's absolutely true but what's

902
01:55:22.40 --> 01:55:29.04
more important than the fact than that we all get to a point where we break is number one that

903
01:55:29.04 --> 01:55:34.40
everybody breaks and number two that doesn't mean it's over that just me that's just it's a bump

904
01:55:34.40 --> 01:55:38.80
in the road it's a bump in the road and you got to rebuild from it you got to come back and you can

905
01:55:38.80 --> 01:55:44.32
you can do that and not only that but largely that bump in the road builds your character

906
01:55:44.32 --> 01:55:49.28
even further because you understand your limitations and you understand that you can overcome these things

907
01:55:49.28 --> 01:55:58.72
and you know back to the story of the prisons of war 591 of us came home and from that 591 men we

908
01:55:58.72 --> 01:56:04.000
produced 17 generals and six admels and most of us retired as senior grade military officers we went

909
01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:09.44
back to flying planes and commanding fleets and and battalions all over the world we have a

910
01:56:09.44 --> 01:56:14.64
bunch of congressmen two united state senators vice president and jacanity president or candidate

911
01:56:14.64 --> 01:56:23.20
all from 591 guys and and so and and we all felt like we'd fail we all felt like we'd given up

912
01:56:23.60 --> 01:56:29.20
but even because of that adversity you know we we came out stronger than ever before

913
01:56:30.24 --> 01:56:37.04
yeah I think this really goes also to the fact that I mean what you're saying is essentially

914
01:56:37.04 --> 01:56:44.72
the fact that you have to know you have to understand what your weaknesses are you really do and

915
01:56:45.52 --> 01:56:52.64
and you have to understand human beings and what human beings weaknesses are and for me you know

916
01:56:52.64 --> 01:56:57.04
and I've talked about this a ton on on this podcast you have to understand that there's that human

917
01:56:57.04 --> 01:57:02.64
beings are capable of doing very dark and horrible things and if you can't and if you can't

918
01:57:02.64 --> 01:57:08.40
recognize that you yourself are capable of the dark and horrible things and of the weak things

919
01:57:09.04 --> 01:57:14.64
well then you're not really being truthful with yourself and and with your existence really as a

920
01:57:14.64 --> 01:57:19.68
human being and you ignore those things and I think when you ignore those things I think that's when they sneak up on you

921
01:57:20.24 --> 01:57:26.16
I think you're right you know I think that's the crux of our real serious challenge with suicide

922
01:57:26.56 --> 01:57:31.76
within the veteran population and and I've worked on this and jams worked on this and and you've

923
01:57:31.76 --> 01:57:38.48
worked on it as well and what are the advantages we had as prisoners of war is that we

924
01:57:39.20 --> 01:57:45.68
that we exposed ourselves you know we recognize our weakness and and to a man we knew that we weren't

925
01:57:45.68 --> 01:57:54.24
as strong as we wanted to be and so just just that community that we built within the prison camp tapping

926
01:57:54.24 --> 01:58:00.08
on walls and tugging on wires and our secret codes very difficult to communicate with everybody else

927
01:58:00.08 --> 01:58:05.68
but we had leadership there that turned that that turned that whole thing around and

928
01:58:06.72 --> 01:58:11.76
and the leadership had weed him and you're not a victim and I'm a very junior officer there

929
01:58:11.76 --> 01:58:15.92
and I'm a Lieutenant J.G. and wait a minute I'm in a communist prison camp

930
01:58:16.32 --> 01:58:23.12
I'm leading to four open wounds I have no medical care and I'm starving I've been tortured

931
01:58:23.12 --> 01:58:31.04
I'm down 115 pounds and I'm not on the defensive I'm not a victim you pull up your big boy pants let's

932
01:58:31.04 --> 01:58:36.08
get on with this thing we got a word of fight and and and and so the leadership totally

933
01:58:36.96 --> 01:58:44.56
reap the the refocus the whole purpose of of our being there and that and and gave us a mission

934
01:58:45.28 --> 01:58:49.92
and I think that's one of the challenges we face when a guy gets out of the military or a gal

935
01:58:49.92 --> 01:58:57.68
and takes off that uniform he loses the purpose he loses that mission and he uses loses that

936
01:58:57.68 --> 01:59:05.68
community and he puts on a coat and tire you know puts on a golf shirt and goes out and tries to

937
01:59:05.68 --> 01:59:12.64
reconnect with people and it Jim is what you were talking about you know being in civilian clothes

938
01:59:12.64 --> 01:59:20.96
and Paris and you you were looking for some way to reconnect with with your unit and ironically

939
01:59:20.96 --> 01:59:28.80
here they come marching down the Champs-Alysée that Alito and and there you were back in uniform

940
01:59:28.80 --> 01:59:36.80
and and so you and you had a wrestling dattra you know you had a purpose a reason to live

941
01:59:36.80 --> 01:59:44.40
just because of the group that you were associated with and and whenever I speak publicly I you know

942
01:59:44.40 --> 01:59:50.08
I challenge an audience to if you've got it if you know a veteran you know talk to them you know

943
01:59:50.08 --> 01:59:58.16
give them a purpose you know invite them to enter into your house your club or your church and

944
01:59:58.72 --> 02:00:04.56
it make make a difference and that way you can serve your country by serving those who serve their country

945
02:00:04.56 --> 02:00:12.08
yeah it's interesting you know Jim you kind of you kind of made that joking comment you know

946
02:00:12.08 --> 02:00:17.36
hey Truman drop the bomb and and ruined a perfectly good war and we all laughed at it but

947
02:00:17.36 --> 02:00:24.000
we all also kind of understand that there's some level of of reality to that and you think when

948
02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:28.08
you're in the military and I always you know I was I was talk about the fact that when I joined

949
02:00:28.08 --> 02:00:34.80
the Navy it was 1990 and I just missed the first Gulf War and like I was completely dismayed by that

950
02:00:34.80 --> 02:00:40.08
because you know there hadn't been a war since basically since Vietnam so it'd been 20 years

951
02:00:40.08 --> 02:00:45.68
and I'm thinking okay there was there was my shot to fight in the war and I just missed it and and

952
02:00:45.68 --> 02:00:52.88
so that that what you're talking about of hey you feel like this is your purpose and and this is what

953
02:00:52.88 --> 02:00:57.60
I'm supposed to be doing with my life and it's a higher purpose and it's a higher cause and it's

954
02:00:57.60 --> 02:01:03.92
something that is is bigger than you and so when you're a part of it it feels good and you want to

955
02:01:03.92 --> 02:01:08.24
participate and you want to help and then when it's over you look around and you go wait a second

956
02:01:08.24 --> 02:01:12.80
what's my higher purpose now and and I think you're right that's where people get in a trouble

957
02:01:12.80 --> 02:01:18.40
because they're so tied to their old higher purpose and they can't transition to the new one

958
02:01:18.40 --> 02:01:23.68
and you know I get great feedback from from that's all the time that they do they open up they go okay

959
02:01:23.68 --> 02:01:26.40
what am I gonna do that's that's what I'm looking at what's your next mission going to be

960
02:01:26.48 --> 02:01:30.96
what is and you know what your next mission might be being a good dad right and that might be your next

961
02:01:30.96 --> 02:01:35.76
mission you know your next mission might be, it might be building airplane hangers you know

962
02:01:35.76 --> 02:01:40.40
you don't know what your next mission is going to be but find out what your next mission is going to

963
02:01:40.40 --> 02:01:45.28
be make it something productive make it something that's gonna impact you know at least

964
02:01:45.28 --> 02:01:47.32
you and your family and get good at it.

965
02:01:47.32 --> 02:01:49.68
Even if you pick something that's somewhat selfish

966
02:01:49.68 --> 02:01:54.68
and you say, hey, I wanna surf on every continent.

967
02:01:55.08 --> 02:01:56.76
Okay, that sounds like a good mission.

968
02:01:56.76 --> 02:01:58.52
Actually, that sounds like a really good mission.

969
02:01:58.52 --> 02:02:00.40
I might have to participate in that one.

970
02:02:00.40 --> 02:02:01.72
But you come up with something,

971
02:02:01.72 --> 02:02:02.72
you can hear my mission.

972
02:02:02.72 --> 02:02:03.72
And this is what I'm gonna do with it.

973
02:02:03.72 --> 02:02:05.68
And this is how I'm gonna go forward.

974
02:02:05.68 --> 02:02:07.68
But yeah, I think that the lack of purpose

975
02:02:07.68 --> 02:02:10.72
and the lack of mission that guys stumble into

976
02:02:10.72 --> 02:02:13.04
is problematic and it is problematic too,

977
02:02:13.04 --> 02:02:15.72
because in the military, it's,

978
02:02:15.72 --> 02:02:17.56
I don't wanna make this sound the wrong way

979
02:02:17.56 --> 02:02:19.72
because I always talk about the fact that for us,

980
02:02:19.72 --> 02:02:22.08
we didn't get tasked missions.

981
02:02:22.08 --> 02:02:24.12
Like when I was in Iraq,

982
02:02:24.12 --> 02:02:25.52
there was no higher up telling me,

983
02:02:25.52 --> 02:02:26.76
you guys are gonna take this target

984
02:02:26.76 --> 02:02:28.56
or you guys are gonna take that happen occasionally,

985
02:02:28.56 --> 02:02:30.56
probably less than 5% of the time,

986
02:02:30.56 --> 02:02:32.56
most of the time we developed our own missions.

987
02:02:32.56 --> 02:02:35.44
But overall, when you're in the military,

988
02:02:35.44 --> 02:02:38.72
you have a broad mission that you're trying to accomplish,

989
02:02:38.72 --> 02:02:42.16
which again is for societal good.

990
02:02:42.16 --> 02:02:44.68
And so when that disappears, guess what?

991
02:02:44.68 --> 02:02:45.96
You have some autonomy now.

992
02:02:45.96 --> 02:02:47.92
Now what are you gonna choose as your next mission?

993
02:02:47.92 --> 02:02:49.08
And what are you gonna do?

994
02:02:49.08 --> 02:02:50.24
How are you gonna improve yourself?

995
02:02:50.24 --> 02:02:51.12
How are you gonna improve your life?

996
02:02:51.12 --> 02:02:53.52
Your families, your communities,

997
02:02:53.52 --> 02:02:55.36
or your countries, or the world?

998
02:02:55.36 --> 02:02:56.56
What are you gonna do to make it better?

999
02:02:56.56 --> 02:02:58.32
And you see the vets that are out there

1000
02:02:58.32 --> 02:03:01.08
that are doing that, and they go.

1001
02:03:01.08 --> 02:03:01.92
They excel.

1002
02:03:01.92 --> 02:03:02.76
They excel.

1003
02:03:02.76 --> 02:03:03.92
You know when I was in the hospital,

1004
02:03:03.92 --> 02:03:06.24
like great lakes after the war,

1005
02:03:06.24 --> 02:03:07.28
I was in the hospital up there.

1006
02:03:07.28 --> 02:03:09.96
I mean, I didn't have any serious problems,

1007
02:03:09.96 --> 02:03:11.84
but I was in a debriefing thing.

1008
02:03:11.84 --> 02:03:14.36
But I had figured out in that hospital,

1009
02:03:14.36 --> 02:03:16.04
and even on the way home,

1010
02:03:16.04 --> 02:03:19.08
that my next stage of life is going,

1011
02:03:19.08 --> 02:03:22.88
I'm going to try to forget all that six years

1012
02:03:22.88 --> 02:03:26.52
of in that prison camp, that six years of pain.

1013
02:03:26.52 --> 02:03:28.04
And I even had it figured out,

1014
02:03:28.04 --> 02:03:30.36
I'm gonna go to some little town in the middle of nowhere.

1015
02:03:30.36 --> 02:03:31.92
Where they've never heard a Charlie Plum,

1016
02:03:31.92 --> 02:03:33.36
and if they have, I'll change my name,

1017
02:03:33.36 --> 02:03:36.64
because I don't want anybody knowing my history.

1018
02:03:36.64 --> 02:03:40.28
I want to slide back into the shadows of life.

1019
02:03:40.28 --> 02:03:42.80
And I was serious about that.

1020
02:03:42.80 --> 02:03:46.28
You know, my high school sweetheart had just

1021
02:03:46.28 --> 02:03:49.36
filed for divorce three months before I came home.

1022
02:03:49.36 --> 02:03:53.72
And so I was, you know, I mean, I felt free,

1023
02:03:53.72 --> 02:03:57.32
and I felt energized, but I really didn't want to have

1024
02:03:57.32 --> 02:03:59.000
anything to do with the Vietnam War

1025
02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:00.56
or any of the pain that I had faced there.

1026
02:04:00.56 --> 02:04:03.16
So I saw no value in it.

1027
02:04:03.16 --> 02:04:07.36
And so I was the first guy back from the war

1028
02:04:07.36 --> 02:04:10.60
in the Midwest, and so the news media,

1029
02:04:10.60 --> 02:04:12.40
you know, really wanted to talk to me.

1030
02:04:12.40 --> 02:04:16.52
And so I found myself surrounded by about 150 photographers

1031
02:04:16.52 --> 02:04:19.000
and reporters in the basement of that hospital.

1032
02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:20.36
And it told my story.

1033
02:04:20.36 --> 02:04:22.36
And on the way back up to my hospital room,

1034
02:04:22.36 --> 02:04:24.48
just as the elevator door is closed,

1035
02:04:24.48 --> 02:04:27.76
this young reporter came up to me.

1036
02:04:27.76 --> 02:04:29.68
And I'm nose to nose with this young guy,

1037
02:04:29.68 --> 02:04:31.80
but he's got lines of anguish in his brow

1038
02:04:31.80 --> 02:04:32.88
and tears in his eyes.

1039
02:04:32.88 --> 02:04:35.000
And he said, Mr. Plum, you really got to me in there.

1040
02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:38.32
He said, I've had a miserable year, my family's falling

1041
02:04:38.32 --> 02:04:40.24
apart, my job is terrible.

1042
02:04:40.24 --> 02:04:44.44
He said, even wondered if I wanted to go on living.

1043
02:04:44.44 --> 02:04:47.52
He said, you've given me hope.

1044
02:04:47.52 --> 02:04:49.76
Well, I hadn't intended to give anybody any hope.

1045
02:04:49.76 --> 02:04:51.76
I'm just telling my story here, you know,

1046
02:04:51.76 --> 02:04:56.60
and it surprised me that there was some value

1047
02:04:56.60 --> 02:04:58.60
in the experience.

1048
02:04:58.60 --> 02:05:03.16
And so, and so I said, well, if in fact,

1049
02:05:03.16 --> 02:05:07.72
that the pain of that experience can help one person,

1050
02:05:07.72 --> 02:05:12.72
you know, in life, then maybe there is a purpose to it.

1051
02:05:12.72 --> 02:05:15.52
And so, so I wrote a book, my autobiography,

1052
02:05:15.52 --> 02:05:17.56
and I started to promote that book.

1053
02:05:17.56 --> 02:05:21.84
And I found that, yes, there's a lot of connection

1054
02:05:21.84 --> 02:05:23.76
with people with challenges.

1055
02:05:23.76 --> 02:05:25.12
And you don't have to be in a military.

1056
02:05:25.12 --> 02:05:26.20
It had a challenge.

1057
02:05:26.20 --> 02:05:30.56
And while my experience might have been a little more dramatic,

1058
02:05:30.56 --> 02:05:32.48
you know, than most, and an interesting story.

1059
02:05:32.48 --> 02:05:33.32
Just a little.

1060
02:05:33.32 --> 02:05:34.16
Just a little.

1061
02:05:34.16 --> 02:05:35.48
Just a little.

1062
02:05:35.48 --> 02:05:40.16
It's still, you know, the challenges I faced

1063
02:05:40.16 --> 02:05:42.04
were the challenges that, you know,

1064
02:05:42.04 --> 02:05:45.52
that a single mother trying to make ends meet makes,

1065
02:05:45.52 --> 02:05:47.68
you know, the frustration and the loneliness

1066
02:05:47.68 --> 02:05:51.16
and the lack of confidence

1067
02:05:51.16 --> 02:05:53.68
and the feeling that you're not measuring up.

1068
02:05:53.68 --> 02:05:55.08
And you know, all of these things,

1069
02:05:55.08 --> 02:05:57.60
these are common human feelings.

1070
02:05:57.60 --> 02:05:59.40
You know what to be in a prison camp,

1071
02:05:59.40 --> 02:06:00.60
to be in prison.

1072
02:06:00.60 --> 02:06:01.92
You know.

1073
02:06:01.92 --> 02:06:04.28
That's a great, well actually I was curious

1074
02:06:04.28 --> 02:06:08.24
because I never heard before about the flat houses

1075
02:06:08.24 --> 02:06:12.52
and that the bombers, the bomber crews were being sent

1076
02:06:12.52 --> 02:06:15.08
to when they'd basically said,

1077
02:06:15.08 --> 02:06:16.80
all right, we're done right now.

1078
02:06:16.80 --> 02:06:20.84
I mean, what was the casualty rate of the bomber crews?

1079
02:06:20.84 --> 02:06:23.52
It was something completely insane, wasn't it?

1080
02:06:23.52 --> 02:06:24.92
Well, it was.

1081
02:06:24.92 --> 02:06:27.84
They had a 25-mission requirement

1082
02:06:27.84 --> 02:06:31.44
and the percentages said they couldn't make it.

1083
02:06:31.44 --> 02:06:34.80
Now we're talking in early 43,

1084
02:06:34.80 --> 02:06:38.56
the started the heavy bomb and things, late 42.

1085
02:06:38.56 --> 02:06:41.28
So let me just focus in on that for one second

1086
02:06:41.28 --> 02:06:42.68
just to explain to everyone what that means

1087
02:06:42.68 --> 02:06:44.52
because I did know about the 25.

1088
02:06:44.52 --> 02:06:47.20
So if you were a bomber crew,

1089
02:06:47.20 --> 02:06:50.56
you were flying in what, a B-17?

1090
02:06:50.56 --> 02:06:52.52
B-17, B-24.

1091
02:06:52.52 --> 02:06:56.52
A B-17 or B-24, big giant flying fortresses

1092
02:06:56.52 --> 02:07:00.32
and they would get attacked ruthlessly attacked

1093
02:07:00.32 --> 02:07:03.28
and they'd fly deep into France and on into Germany

1094
02:07:03.28 --> 02:07:09.28
and they would get swarmed and attacked by German fighter pilots

1095
02:07:09.28 --> 02:07:12.72
and also anti-aircraft guns from the ground.

1096
02:07:12.72 --> 02:07:16.16
And so it was, it was hellish to get through

1097
02:07:16.16 --> 02:07:19.52
and it was so bad that they said,

1098
02:07:19.52 --> 02:07:21.96
okay, well, all you have to do is this many missions

1099
02:07:21.96 --> 02:07:25.16
and the number was 25, which I did know that number.

1100
02:07:25.16 --> 02:07:27.72
You had to make it through 25 of these bomber ones

1101
02:07:27.72 --> 02:07:28.84
and you were done.

1102
02:07:28.84 --> 02:07:30.88
You, that was it, you didn't have to do anymore.

1103
02:07:30.88 --> 02:07:34.08
But you're saying the chances of actually making it

1104
02:07:34.08 --> 02:07:36.88
through those 25 was minimal.

1105
02:07:36.88 --> 02:07:39.48
Yeah, percentages were against you.

1106
02:07:39.48 --> 02:07:41.48
Now sure, some people are gonna get through,

1107
02:07:41.48 --> 02:07:44.52
some people are gonna be shot down on their first mission.

1108
02:07:44.52 --> 02:07:46.76
They don't get a second mission.

1109
02:07:46.76 --> 02:07:50.76
But, and this was the problem with the heavy bomber forces

1110
02:07:50.76 --> 02:07:53.28
and we almost lost that one.

1111
02:07:53.28 --> 02:07:54.80
I mean, we came close.

1112
02:07:54.80 --> 02:07:58.40
Well, we were at the ragged edge and all,

1113
02:07:58.40 --> 02:08:03.04
and I'm repeating what I learned as a youngster

1114
02:08:03.04 --> 02:08:06.08
that that time trying to be an aviation cadet.

1115
02:08:06.08 --> 02:08:09.52
Guys, we're hanging on by our fingertips.

1116
02:08:09.52 --> 02:08:12.20
When you say we almost lost that one, you mean we almost

1117
02:08:12.20 --> 02:08:13.96
had to stop the bombing campaign?

1118
02:08:13.96 --> 02:08:16.64
Well, the British were after us,

1119
02:08:16.64 --> 02:08:20.64
they had switched to light bombing for this very same reason.

1120
02:08:20.64 --> 02:08:23.16
It's stay away from the fighters.

1121
02:08:23.16 --> 02:08:27.96
And so our philosophy of Everett Bombar

1122
02:08:27.96 --> 02:08:33.96
was back to General Mitchell in the early and 30s

1123
02:08:33.96 --> 02:08:37.64
and late 20s, in fact early 20s,

1124
02:08:37.64 --> 02:08:39.92
that the bombers will fight their way through.

1125
02:08:39.92 --> 02:08:43.96
And that was the theory of the B-17.

1126
02:08:43.96 --> 02:08:47.24
And I should know they were heavily armed,

1127
02:08:47.24 --> 02:08:51.60
but they were up against the determined enemy.

1128
02:08:51.60 --> 02:08:56.88
And there are 500 miles from home and German fighters,

1129
02:08:56.88 --> 02:08:58.56
all they gotta do step out.

1130
02:08:58.56 --> 02:09:01.08
They don't like what's going on bail out.

1131
02:09:01.08 --> 02:09:04.60
They're coming down and we'll go get another airplane.

1132
02:09:04.60 --> 02:09:08.32
But those were dark days.

1133
02:09:08.32 --> 02:09:13.16
And they were dark days until the first fighters,

1134
02:09:13.16 --> 02:09:17.52
the beep, the P-47s could only go so deep.

1135
02:09:17.52 --> 02:09:19.64
What could they go like, 200 miles deep?

1136
02:09:19.64 --> 02:09:24.04
That 200 miles, yes, and having that fuel to get home.

1137
02:09:24.04 --> 02:09:27.44
And the rest of the times, the other 300 mile round trip

1138
02:09:27.44 --> 02:09:30.96
or 400 extra miles were all the bombers by themselves.

1139
02:09:30.96 --> 02:09:33.64
If it was 50 miles, it was hell.

1140
02:09:33.64 --> 02:09:36.56
Once the fighters turned back.

1141
02:09:36.56 --> 02:09:41.56
So they sent, they ended up with four groups of P-38s.

1142
02:09:41.88 --> 02:09:47.08
And 38 was not ready to go to war over what Germany

1143
02:09:47.08 --> 02:09:48.92
at that time at the altitude.

1144
02:09:48.92 --> 02:09:50.88
We were having trouble with the airplane.

1145
02:09:50.88 --> 02:09:55.32
And we didn't have the latest modifications to the airplane.

1146
02:09:55.32 --> 02:10:01.88
So part of our problem was engine problems with the Allison

1147
02:10:01.88 --> 02:10:04.88
engines, but they went anyway.

1148
02:10:04.88 --> 02:10:07.68
And so then the 51 came along.

1149
02:10:07.68 --> 02:10:11.84
The 51 had a British engine, which had been developed

1150
02:10:11.84 --> 02:10:19.40
in that very same area.

1151
02:10:19.40 --> 02:10:23.64
And they weren't having the cold.

1152
02:10:23.64 --> 02:10:28.60
Their engine had been designed at Aubrey 60 degrees below zero.

1153
02:10:28.60 --> 02:10:32.36
And so they matched the two up and so on late 43,

1154
02:10:32.36 --> 02:10:33.96
they get the first group over there.

1155
02:10:33.96 --> 02:10:36.20
And now there's a little hope.

1156
02:10:36.20 --> 02:10:37.68
The airplane could go the hallway.

1157
02:10:37.68 --> 02:10:40.64
The 38s had been going to go the whole way.

1158
02:10:40.64 --> 02:10:44.20
But 38 had been modified for the Pacific.

1159
02:10:44.20 --> 02:10:46.000
And there was no heat in the cockpit.

1160
02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:47.08
And you're sitting up there.

1161
02:10:47.08 --> 02:10:49.52
It's 60 degrees below zero.

1162
02:10:49.52 --> 02:10:52.88
Freason in your tail off with the oxygen.

1163
02:10:52.88 --> 02:10:56.92
The oxygen in the mass is actually frozen to your face.

1164
02:10:56.92 --> 02:10:57.68
Heat came in.

1165
02:10:57.68 --> 02:11:01.28
You had one warm spot in the whole cockpit.

1166
02:11:01.28 --> 02:11:02.88
And that was your right foot.

1167
02:11:02.88 --> 02:11:05.000
That's the way the heat came in.

1168
02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:09.40
So everything else is freezing your pan and off.

1169
02:11:09.40 --> 02:11:13.32
So we had problems.

1170
02:11:13.32 --> 02:11:22.000
Luckily, the British engine in the 51 and North American's tremendous design,

1171
02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:28.20
put together the airplane that could do the job.

1172
02:11:28.20 --> 02:11:29.60
And then they could, it could be 51s.

1173
02:11:29.60 --> 02:11:31.44
I scored in the whole, the whole way.

1174
02:11:31.44 --> 02:11:34.32
And it goes around and goes someplace else.

1175
02:11:34.32 --> 02:11:35.32
Wow.

1176
02:11:35.32 --> 02:11:37.32
The 38 could do that.

1177
02:11:37.32 --> 02:11:39.44
It had the fuel to do it.

1178
02:11:39.44 --> 02:11:44.58
But again, there's an old story about the 38

1179
02:11:44.58 --> 02:11:47.24
to kind of broke our heart.

1180
02:11:47.24 --> 02:11:51.28
There was two great modifications to the P38.

1181
02:11:51.28 --> 02:11:54.48
The 38 had altitude up with the bombers.

1182
02:11:54.48 --> 02:11:56.24
And they're hit with fighters.

1183
02:11:56.24 --> 02:11:58.48
You can get into a scrap.

1184
02:11:58.48 --> 02:12:00.64
And the German rolls over.

1185
02:12:00.64 --> 02:12:05.24
And they had explained the flick roll that I encountered.

1186
02:12:05.24 --> 02:12:09.80
They'd do a flick roll in split S. Make a dive to the deck.

1187
02:12:09.80 --> 02:12:13.16
If the 38 did that and tried to follow them,

1188
02:12:13.16 --> 02:12:18.04
the airplane would accelerate into what we call a compressibility.

1189
02:12:18.04 --> 02:12:21.28
And compressibility was nothing more than a shockwave off

1190
02:12:21.28 --> 02:12:27.24
of the wing that killed it to all the control in your impenade.

1191
02:12:27.24 --> 02:12:29.16
So you couldn't pull out.

1192
02:12:29.16 --> 02:12:32.92
So all you could do is ride it down until you got into what we

1193
02:12:32.92 --> 02:12:36.32
called the figure.

1194
02:12:36.32 --> 02:12:41.08
Then your trim tab, if you set it properly,

1195
02:12:41.08 --> 02:12:45.40
would gradually bring you out of that dive before you hit the ground.

1196
02:12:45.40 --> 02:12:48.000
Some of them hit the ground.

1197
02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:53.92
So we didn't have, we had a very slow rate of roll in the 38.

1198
02:12:53.92 --> 02:12:58.96
So they developed ill-arron boost.

1199
02:12:58.96 --> 02:13:03.68
So we could roll with anybody.

1200
02:13:03.68 --> 02:13:05.44
They had the dive flap.

1201
02:13:05.44 --> 02:13:10.04
So if you went in, you could actually hit the dive flap button.

1202
02:13:10.04 --> 02:13:13.84
Put that airplane straight down and dive with anybody.

1203
02:13:13.84 --> 02:13:15.76
It ate German fighter.

1204
02:13:15.76 --> 02:13:20.36
So what Lockie did, they got 400 sets,

1205
02:13:20.36 --> 02:13:24.48
shift sets of dive flaps, an aileron boost.

1206
02:13:24.48 --> 02:13:31.16
And they put it on an air force, transport plane, and they sent it to England.

1207
02:13:31.16 --> 02:13:34.88
It got intercepted off the English coast by the RIF.

1208
02:13:34.88 --> 02:13:36.48
You didn't know anything about it.

1209
02:13:36.48 --> 02:13:42.12
They thought it was a German condor for an engine air base shot at down.

1210
02:13:42.12 --> 02:13:43.12
Oh, my God.

1211
02:13:43.12 --> 02:13:46.12
There goes all of our improvements.

1212
02:13:46.12 --> 02:13:48.56
And so what do you do now?

1213
02:13:48.56 --> 02:13:54.16
It took quite a while to pull all those 400 units together and get them over there.

1214
02:13:54.16 --> 02:13:59.04
So for the next couple months, the 38s are doing the same old thing.

1215
02:13:59.04 --> 02:14:00.88
We don't have the improvement.

1216
02:14:00.88 --> 02:14:04.56
If E51 comes along, thank God.

1217
02:14:04.56 --> 02:14:06.84
And it can do the job.

1218
02:14:06.84 --> 02:14:08.60
So it's all history.

1219
02:14:08.60 --> 02:14:09.60
Yeah.

1220
02:14:09.60 --> 02:14:10.60
E51s had trouble.

1221
02:14:10.60 --> 02:14:13.88
I know of one that pulled out of a dive and a whole day on the engine.

1222
02:14:13.88 --> 02:14:17.84
Fill out the airplane and the dive that killed.

1223
02:14:17.84 --> 02:14:21.20
But they had engines quit.

1224
02:14:21.20 --> 02:14:23.72
That was a single engine fighter.

1225
02:14:23.72 --> 02:14:25.04
That's the problem.

1226
02:14:25.04 --> 02:14:27.60
Somebody throws a rock dutch and it hits it right here.

1227
02:14:27.60 --> 02:14:29.36
You're all done.

1228
02:14:29.36 --> 02:14:33.44
So, but those were trying times.

1229
02:14:33.44 --> 02:14:41.000
Yeah, I guess I was with all that, you know, thinking about these guys that were in those

1230
02:14:41.000 --> 02:14:43.76
bomber crews that would need a break.

1231
02:14:43.76 --> 02:14:46.60
And they say, OK, you need to go over here and not think about this.

1232
02:14:46.60 --> 02:14:52.000
And it reminds me of talking about Dick Winners from the first the 506 band of brothers

1233
02:14:52.000 --> 02:14:54.60
and what he would say when he would see guys were getting stressed out.

1234
02:14:54.60 --> 02:15:01.20
He'd get them off the line, get them out of it and give them the rest that they need.

1235
02:15:01.20 --> 02:15:05.16
And then I think there's a certain part of you that goes, OK, I need to not think about

1236
02:15:05.16 --> 02:15:07.16
this right now.

1237
02:15:07.16 --> 02:15:10.60
And then I think you got to say, OK, now I'm going to talk about this.

1238
02:15:10.60 --> 02:15:14.000
And the fact that you get around, you're friends, and that's what a lot of people that

1239
02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:17.76
listen to podcasts, a lot of veterans that listen to podcasts, they go, you know, now, you

1240
02:15:17.76 --> 02:15:21.60
know, I've had my break, but now you're talking about this stuff and I appreciate it.

1241
02:15:21.60 --> 02:15:26.48
And I, you bring, let's me know that I'm not the only guy that thinks this way or had those

1242
02:15:26.48 --> 02:15:28.60
thoughts or, you know, went through this.

1243
02:15:28.60 --> 02:15:30.24
And I think that's, that's good.

1244
02:15:30.24 --> 02:15:32.12
So I think it's, I think you do need a break.

1245
02:15:32.12 --> 02:15:37.28
And actually, that, now that I think about it, when I was in Ramadi, I had the book that

1246
02:15:37.28 --> 02:15:40.72
I read every night was about face by Colonel David Hackworth and I read it every single

1247
02:15:40.72 --> 02:15:46.36
night, every single night, and then about three months into deployment, I wanted to, I

1248
02:15:46.36 --> 02:15:50.76
didn't want to think about, you know, I didn't want to go to bed thinking about, you

1249
02:15:50.76 --> 02:15:52.60
know, the war and war.

1250
02:15:52.60 --> 02:15:57.56
And so there was a random book sitting around and I picked up, it was actually a book called

1251
02:15:57.56 --> 02:16:03.44
the Electric Coolade Acid Test, which is about the hippies in, it's written by Tom Wolf,

1252
02:16:03.44 --> 02:16:04.44
who wrote the right stuff.

1253
02:16:04.44 --> 02:16:05.44
Sure.

1254
02:16:05.44 --> 02:16:06.44
But it's a great book.

1255
02:16:06.44 --> 02:16:12.04
And it was so completely outside of what I was doing that it gave me, you know, like a

1256
02:16:12.04 --> 02:16:13.04
mental break.

1257
02:16:13.04 --> 02:16:17.72
And I read that book and it was, you know, it took me four days to read that book.

1258
02:16:17.72 --> 02:16:22.04
And I got done and I put it away and pulled about face back out and I continued on.

1259
02:16:22.04 --> 02:16:24.48
But I just needed a little bit of a breather, right?

1260
02:16:24.48 --> 02:16:26.64
Just a little bit of a mental breather.

1261
02:16:26.64 --> 02:16:30.96
And I guess hippies and LSD provided me with that.

1262
02:16:30.96 --> 02:16:36.12
Reading about those hippies and LSD provided me with this mental break.

1263
02:16:36.12 --> 02:16:42.32
And it was actually, it's a very interesting book and it shows the mentality that those

1264
02:16:42.32 --> 02:16:51.60
people had, you know, which was the way he summed it up was, was me, me, me, me, everything's

1265
02:16:51.60 --> 02:16:52.60
about me.

1266
02:16:52.60 --> 02:16:54.84
And that was what was good for me to read this book.

1267
02:16:54.84 --> 02:16:58.64
I'm like, okay, that's not how I want to be with my life.

1268
02:16:58.64 --> 02:16:59.64
It's not about me.

1269
02:16:59.64 --> 02:17:02.000
It's about, you know, what we're trying to do here.

1270
02:17:02.000 --> 02:17:04.76
So yeah, I think sometimes people need a mental break.

1271
02:17:04.76 --> 02:17:09.52
I can't even imagine what was going on in one of those flat houses with those guys.

1272
02:17:09.52 --> 02:17:12.52
That's like an R&R for you.

1273
02:17:12.52 --> 02:17:19.08
It's an R&R and they were run by the Red Cross and I was at Maltzord Manor, which was

1274
02:17:19.08 --> 02:17:21.64
right on the Tim's River.

1275
02:17:21.64 --> 02:17:26.52
Of course, I was there when we had the ice storms.

1276
02:17:26.52 --> 02:17:34.40
And in fact, when I left the black house to go back to Paris, I couldn't get a ride across

1277
02:17:34.40 --> 02:17:41.52
the channel and just what our friend Len Miller got a ride and disappeared.

1278
02:17:41.52 --> 02:17:49.48
And so I'm trying to get across the channel to Paris and it's between Christmas and

1279
02:17:49.48 --> 02:17:51.48
New Years.

1280
02:17:51.48 --> 02:18:01.96
And I went out to several of the bases around London to get an ATC aircraft to go to Paris

1281
02:18:01.96 --> 02:18:04.08
and they're all grounded.

1282
02:18:04.08 --> 02:18:13.08
And so I went down to Southampton and two ships had just commended to Southampton that were

1283
02:18:13.08 --> 02:18:15.40
going on to Lahar.

1284
02:18:15.40 --> 02:18:24.60
And so I got on board and they were hospital ships with complete complement of general

1285
02:18:24.60 --> 02:18:31.28
hospitals, like two or three different general hospitals and full of nurses.

1286
02:18:31.28 --> 02:18:39.88
And so New Years Eve, we're on this ship with all these nurses.

1287
02:18:39.88 --> 02:18:48.80
And we're on, I guess you'd call it, battle stations because the e-boats from the Germany

1288
02:18:48.80 --> 02:18:57.92
boats were operating in the channel and we're going across from Southampton to Lahar and

1289
02:18:57.92 --> 02:19:02.000
all these nervous nurses from the US needed comfort.

1290
02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:08.000
Did you get a medal for that?

1291
02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:09.000
No.

1292
02:19:09.000 --> 02:19:14.000
So anyway, that was a story.

1293
02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:18.000
Now, just how I got to the end of this story, I forgot.

1294
02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:19.000
I don't even care anymore.

1295
02:19:19.000 --> 02:19:27.52
I picked up a couple of things when we were talking.

1296
02:19:27.52 --> 02:19:33.20
And when I got shot down, you read this citation.

1297
02:19:33.20 --> 02:19:37.92
Well, I didn't know anything about that citation.

1298
02:19:37.92 --> 02:19:40.40
I had gotten my fany shot off.

1299
02:19:40.40 --> 02:19:42.40
I was not happy.

1300
02:19:42.40 --> 02:19:48.80
I said, I kept thinking, what could I have done different that I could have stayed in that

1301
02:19:48.80 --> 02:19:52.88
bite longer?

1302
02:19:52.88 --> 02:19:56.68
I never came up with the answer.

1303
02:19:56.68 --> 02:19:58.16
What could I have done?

1304
02:19:58.16 --> 02:20:07.64
So for about from September to like, at this orders to go to Paris, the spots is head quarters.

1305
02:20:07.64 --> 02:20:10.48
I was not the highest.

1306
02:20:10.48 --> 02:20:12.52
I didn't think much of myself.

1307
02:20:12.52 --> 02:20:22.64
I was why I couldn't have done a better job.

1308
02:20:22.64 --> 02:20:30.40
Reading that citation and then belonging to a group called the Legion of Baller, which

1309
02:20:30.40 --> 02:20:35.40
there are not too many Air Force guys left.

1310
02:20:35.40 --> 02:20:43.40
And I read what these people have done.

1311
02:20:43.40 --> 02:20:44.28
These ground, because in fact, what am I very close friends and had the distinguished service

1312
02:20:44.28 --> 02:20:48.16
cross and they just operated it to Congressional Medal of Honor.

1313
02:20:48.16 --> 02:20:50.96
And he's gotten quite a bit of publicity.

1314
02:20:50.96 --> 02:20:53.56
And he was in Vietnam.

1315
02:20:53.56 --> 02:21:00.28
And my comment when I saw that he had gotten the Congressional Medal of Honor at this

1316
02:21:00.28 --> 02:21:04.36
late date, that was God.

1317
02:21:04.36 --> 02:21:08.04
But he finally read his citation.

1318
02:21:08.04 --> 02:21:18.36
And when you think that what all of these guys did, a lot of the fellows in the Legion

1319
02:21:18.36 --> 02:21:21.72
of Baller are medics.

1320
02:21:21.72 --> 02:21:28.28
What they did in combat conditions and got to just English curves across the Navy,

1321
02:21:28.28 --> 02:21:30.48
cross and so forth.

1322
02:21:30.48 --> 02:21:35.64
I read my citation, it took six minutes.

1323
02:21:35.64 --> 02:21:37.16
That's all.

1324
02:21:37.16 --> 02:21:40.64
And then I read a book called I'm No Hero.

1325
02:21:40.64 --> 02:21:52.24
And I think Charlie Poem, six years of bat, my six minutes for me.

1326
02:21:52.24 --> 02:21:56.84
I mean, what he went through is just unbelievable to me.

1327
02:21:56.84 --> 02:21:59.12
And so don't give me the monk about him.

1328
02:21:59.12 --> 02:22:02.12
I'm no hero, he's my hero.

1329
02:22:02.12 --> 02:22:09.12
But it's deep thought.

1330
02:22:09.12 --> 02:22:10.12
Thanks for that, Jam.

1331
02:22:10.12 --> 02:22:11.68
I appreciate you're saying that.

1332
02:22:11.68 --> 02:22:17.04
But let me toss one more question that you, Jaco, because Jim and I have both talked about

1333
02:22:17.04 --> 02:22:19.80
getting shot down and feeling miserable.

1334
02:22:19.80 --> 02:22:24.36
After your fight where you accidentally killed one of the Iraqi soldiers, but you felt

1335
02:22:24.36 --> 02:22:26.96
pretty little about that.

1336
02:22:26.96 --> 02:22:31.04
Yeah, that's about as bad as it gets.

1337
02:22:31.04 --> 02:22:34.08
And it was a horrible situation.

1338
02:22:34.08 --> 02:22:36.08
It was the fog of war.

1339
02:22:36.08 --> 02:22:39.44
It was multiple units out on the battlefield.

1340
02:22:39.44 --> 02:22:44.84
It was actually not me that shot an Iraqi soldier.

1341
02:22:44.84 --> 02:22:52.92
It was one of my small teams that was in a position where amongst the confusion, they

1342
02:22:52.92 --> 02:22:58.92
were assaulted by a friendly group of Iraqi soldiers with one.

1343
02:22:58.92 --> 02:23:01.16
They had one Marine with them.

1344
02:23:01.16 --> 02:23:11.36
And yeah, it's something that you can, it's hard to make definite statements or say,

1345
02:23:11.36 --> 02:23:18.000
I know this for a fact, but there's pretty much not anything worse in war than friendly forces

1346
02:23:18.000 --> 02:23:20.92
killing friendly forces.

1347
02:23:20.92 --> 02:23:22.68
Because that's just as bad as it gets.

1348
02:23:22.68 --> 02:23:26.96
And it's a real taboo in special operations for sure.

1349
02:23:26.96 --> 02:23:28.52
It's a taboo in any.

1350
02:23:28.52 --> 02:23:35.60
And I'll tell you, during the, during the, I guess we'll say the dry years in between Vietnam

1351
02:23:35.60 --> 02:23:38.20
and the current wars were in.

1352
02:23:38.20 --> 02:23:46.32
There was, we actually lost the understanding of how these things could happen.

1353
02:23:46.32 --> 02:23:49.24
And no one really understood the fog of war anymore.

1354
02:23:49.24 --> 02:23:52.60
And therefore we didn't train to it properly.

1355
02:23:52.60 --> 02:23:59.40
And so when it happened, it was, it was like an unbelievable thing.

1356
02:23:59.40 --> 02:24:00.92
It was so bad.

1357
02:24:00.92 --> 02:24:03.04
It was the absolute worst thing that it could happen.

1358
02:24:03.04 --> 02:24:05.80
Actually, I would say there'd be one more thing.

1359
02:24:05.80 --> 02:24:09.76
You know, the, the person that was killed, the soldier that was killed was an Iraqi soldier.

1360
02:24:09.76 --> 02:24:13.44
You know, if it had been a seal or an American, I guess that would make it one level higher

1361
02:24:13.44 --> 02:24:15.56
from he, because I would have known the person.

1362
02:24:15.56 --> 02:24:20.64
You know, in this case, it was an Iraqi soldier again, a tragic loss nonetheless.

1363
02:24:20.64 --> 02:24:22.88
But, you know, how did I feel?

1364
02:24:22.88 --> 02:24:25.28
It felt absolutely horrible.

1365
02:24:25.28 --> 02:24:31.96
And the thing that, you know, the thing that changed the mindset for me was when I realized

1366
02:24:31.96 --> 02:24:36.04
that as I sat there and, and reviewed, because, you know, my commanding officer was coming

1367
02:24:36.04 --> 02:24:41.52
to inspect and review what had happened along with the investigating officer.

1368
02:24:41.52 --> 02:24:47.84
And, you know, the thing that changed my mindset was, as I sat there and said, okay, who's

1369
02:24:47.84 --> 02:24:48.84
fault is this?

1370
02:24:48.84 --> 02:24:49.84
Who's fault is this?

1371
02:24:49.84 --> 02:24:50.84
Who's fault is this?

1372
02:24:50.84 --> 02:24:51.84
Who's fault is this?

1373
02:24:51.84 --> 02:24:53.84
And I'm looking at all the different mistakes that were made by all the different units

1374
02:24:53.84 --> 02:24:55.64
and all the different people.

1375
02:24:55.64 --> 02:24:59.28
And as I'm looking to blame this on someone, it became very clear to me in a, like a

1376
02:24:59.28 --> 02:25:02.56
bolt of lightning that there's only one person in charge of this and therefore there's only

1377
02:25:02.56 --> 02:25:04.84
one person responsible for what happens out there.

1378
02:25:04.84 --> 02:25:06.20
And that's me.

1379
02:25:06.20 --> 02:25:15.92
And honestly, when I had that transition in thought and it was, it was the first moment

1380
02:25:15.92 --> 02:25:20.04
that I felt actually okay.

1381
02:25:20.04 --> 02:25:26.12
There's a horrible sinking feeling that you get in, in, in, in wartime situations.

1382
02:25:26.12 --> 02:25:30.52
I guess you can get another time soon and I've talked about it with, with some of my friends.

1383
02:25:30.52 --> 02:25:35.44
It's, it's like when something is just really horrible is happening.

1384
02:25:35.44 --> 02:25:41.76
You get this, not in your stomach and this, it's, I've never felt it any other times,

1385
02:25:41.76 --> 02:25:49.92
but when I was overseas, of, like this is, I have, it's, it's the most horrible feeling.

1386
02:25:49.92 --> 02:25:59.44
And that was, that was the most severe I ever felt it was leading up to my own recognition

1387
02:25:59.44 --> 02:26:00.64
that, you know what?

1388
02:26:00.64 --> 02:26:05.36
And, and where that was coming from was the unknown and I didn't know how to react to it.

1389
02:26:05.36 --> 02:26:10.24
And here I was, you know, Mr. Experience, Seal, Mr., you know, in charge of the task unit,

1390
02:26:10.24 --> 02:26:11.24
whatever.

1391
02:26:11.24 --> 02:26:14.96
And yet here I was going, how do I deal with this?

1392
02:26:14.96 --> 02:26:16.88
And I didn't understand how to deal with it.

1393
02:26:16.88 --> 02:26:21.92
And what I had to do is go to what I actually did know, which is if you're in a leadership position,

1394
02:26:21.92 --> 02:26:23.96
you take responsibility for what happens.

1395
02:26:23.96 --> 02:26:24.96
That's what you do.

1396
02:26:24.96 --> 02:26:27.96
So, hey, that's what you do.

1397
02:26:27.96 --> 02:26:31.08
And if, if they're going to fire you, you get fired.

1398
02:26:31.08 --> 02:26:33.68
If they're going to reprimand you, you get reprimanded.

1399
02:26:33.68 --> 02:26:38.16
If they're going to replace you with someone else, you get replaced, you salute, you do the best turn over you can.

1400
02:26:38.16 --> 02:26:41.40
You try and do the, you know, give all the information you can.

1401
02:26:41.40 --> 02:26:42.76
That's what you do.

1402
02:26:42.76 --> 02:26:49.76
And as soon as I accepted that and looked at it and said, okay, well then, that not started to go away.

1403
02:26:49.76 --> 02:26:55.40
And I realized that, okay, the real problem here is, is you, the way that you're looking at this.

1404
02:26:55.40 --> 02:27:02.64
But, uh, and then the other big thing is once you admit what those, or, and you take ownership of those problems,

1405
02:27:02.64 --> 02:27:08.52
and you actually, not just take ownership of the problems, but you say, here's the problems and here's what we're going to get them solved.

1406
02:27:08.52 --> 02:27:14.96
Here's the standard operating procedures that we're now going to follow to make sure that this never happens again.

1407
02:27:14.96 --> 02:27:18.72
Well, then people look at you and they go, okay, he's got a plan.

1408
02:27:18.72 --> 02:27:22.40
He's not sitting here dodging the, the blame for this.

1409
02:27:22.40 --> 02:27:25.56
He's actually taking ownership of the problems and he's going to get himself.

1410
02:27:25.56 --> 02:27:32.08
And I think, you know, I've never had this conversation with my commanding officer about his reaction.

1411
02:27:32.08 --> 02:27:34.68
But I could see it, you know, I could see it.

1412
02:27:34.68 --> 02:27:39.16
And the fact that I, the fact that he said, okay, you know, let's make sure it doesn't happen again.

1413
02:27:39.16 --> 02:27:41.64
I like the procedures that you're putting in place.

1414
02:27:41.64 --> 02:27:43.52
Use caution, proceed.

1415
02:27:43.52 --> 02:27:47.08
You know, where is I believe that if I would have said, well, what was my fault?

1416
02:27:47.08 --> 02:27:48.08
It was his fault.

1417
02:27:48.08 --> 02:27:52.92
And therefore, the other guy's fault, he would have said, okay, you need, you're not going to have this job anymore.

1418
02:27:52.92 --> 02:27:54.28
And I think that's the same thing with life.

1419
02:27:54.28 --> 02:27:58.84
You know, a minute that you're, you're looking around you and you're saying, hey, it's someone else's fault that this,

1420
02:27:58.84 --> 02:28:01.04
that I'm in this bad situation.

1421
02:28:01.04 --> 02:28:02.40
And again, you know what?

1422
02:28:02.40 --> 02:28:04.72
Okay, there's things that happen.

1423
02:28:04.72 --> 02:28:08.16
I get that there's things that happen to people.

1424
02:28:08.16 --> 02:28:09.32
You mentioned one of them.

1425
02:28:09.32 --> 02:28:11.64
You can get a disease that you can't control.

1426
02:28:11.64 --> 02:28:16.40
You know, you can get, you can have a child get hit by a car.

1427
02:28:16.40 --> 02:28:20.84
I mean, there's awful things that can happen that you can't have control over.

1428
02:28:20.84 --> 02:28:25.04
But what you can have control over is how you proceed and how you go forward.

1429
02:28:25.04 --> 02:28:30.88
And that's the part that you need to focus on because the, the opportunity to fix what happened in the past,

1430
02:28:30.88 --> 02:28:31.72
it's gone.

1431
02:28:31.72 --> 02:28:33.04
I'm sorry.

1432
02:28:33.04 --> 02:28:34.24
There's no time machine.

1433
02:28:34.24 --> 02:28:36.000
There's no way of going back.

1434
02:28:36.000 --> 02:28:36.84
It's happened.

1435
02:28:36.84 --> 02:28:37.64
It's gone.

1436
02:28:37.64 --> 02:28:39.36
Okay, how are you going to move forward?

1437
02:28:39.36 --> 02:28:40.68
Where are you going to go now?

1438
02:28:40.68 --> 02:28:42.08
That's what you need to focus on.

1439
02:28:42.08 --> 02:28:43.60
And I've said that about regret, too.

1440
02:28:43.60 --> 02:28:45.44
People say, oh, you know, I live with no regrets.

1441
02:28:45.44 --> 02:28:47.24
I'm like, oh, there's all kinds of things.

1442
02:28:47.24 --> 02:28:51.12
I'll tell you, I regret, but I don't walk around with them because I can't do anything about them.

1443
02:28:51.12 --> 02:28:55.96
Like, you know, maybe you would have maneuvered your aircraft a little bit different on September

1444
02:28:55.96 --> 02:28:57.44
16th, 1944.

1445
02:28:57.44 --> 02:29:01.24
You've looked at it, maybe you couldn't, but maybe you could have, but you don't walk around

1446
02:29:01.24 --> 02:29:03.88
carrying that because it doesn't matter anymore.

1447
02:29:03.88 --> 02:29:05.56
And it's the same thing with the things I've been through.

1448
02:29:05.56 --> 02:29:07.60
It's like, okay, look, I made mistakes.

1449
02:29:07.60 --> 02:29:08.60
You made mistakes.

1450
02:29:08.60 --> 02:29:09.60
We've all made mistakes.

1451
02:29:09.60 --> 02:29:10.80
Okay, what are we going to do?

1452
02:29:10.80 --> 02:29:14.72
Are we going to do all those and let them, you know, bear down on us and even things

1453
02:29:14.72 --> 02:29:15.72
that we can't control.

1454
02:29:15.72 --> 02:29:18.92
Maybe the mistake wasn't ours or something that we couldn't control.

1455
02:29:18.92 --> 02:29:20.72
Not going to carry that.

1456
02:29:20.72 --> 02:29:23.20
I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm not going to carry that regret.

1457
02:29:23.20 --> 02:29:25.08
I'm going to say what, what can I do to move forward?

1458
02:29:25.08 --> 02:29:28.28
And actually, there's a great guy just had on the podcast named Rob Jones.

1459
02:29:28.28 --> 02:29:30.12
He's a Marine.

1460
02:29:30.12 --> 02:29:33.08
He fought in Iraq and in Afghanistan.

1461
02:29:33.08 --> 02:29:40.92
And he ended up, he was a bomb disposal digging for mines, a combat engineer.

1462
02:29:40.92 --> 02:29:42.68
And he ended up finding a mine.

1463
02:29:42.68 --> 02:29:45.84
And he found that mine, you know, with his own feet.

1464
02:29:45.84 --> 02:29:47.72
And he lost both of his legs.

1465
02:29:47.72 --> 02:29:51.08
And he said something that was, was awesome.

1466
02:29:51.08 --> 02:29:54.28
He said, you know, you've got this weight that's bearing down on you.

1467
02:29:54.28 --> 02:29:55.68
And he was sitting in a hospital bed.

1468
02:29:55.68 --> 02:29:57.76
And he had this weight that was bearing down on him.

1469
02:29:57.76 --> 02:30:02.32
Of he's going to live now the rest of his life with, you know, both legs, amputee, amputee

1470
02:30:02.32 --> 02:30:04.84
it above the knee.

1471
02:30:04.84 --> 02:30:08.40
And he, you know, he said, what am I going to do with this weight?

1472
02:30:08.40 --> 02:30:13.60
Am I going to let it, am I going to let it push me down and bury me under the ground?

1473
02:30:13.60 --> 02:30:16.72
Or am I going to use that weight to make myself stronger?

1474
02:30:16.72 --> 02:30:21.20
And I think that's an incredible attitude to have.

1475
02:30:21.20 --> 02:30:23.84
And by the way, he's about to run 31 marathons.

1476
02:30:23.84 --> 02:30:24.84
It's 31 days.

1477
02:30:24.84 --> 02:30:27.84
He's going to run 31 marathons in 31 days.

1478
02:30:27.84 --> 02:30:28.84
Good.

1479
02:30:28.84 --> 02:30:29.84
Yeah.

1480
02:30:29.84 --> 02:30:30.84
Unbelievable.

1481
02:30:30.84 --> 02:30:37.72
So, you know, the toughest flying that I ever did was in combat and support of the ground

1482
02:30:37.72 --> 02:30:38.72
troops.

1483
02:30:38.72 --> 02:30:43.40
And they'd bring us in with rockers or bombs or napoms.

1484
02:30:43.40 --> 02:30:45.96
We didn't have any guns on that airplane.

1485
02:30:45.96 --> 02:30:50.68
And but we knew that we had to get close, but not too close to the, to the friendlies,

1486
02:30:50.68 --> 02:30:51.68
to be effective.

1487
02:30:51.68 --> 02:30:59.32
So we couldn't put our weapons, you know, 40 clicks away and do it to get it all.

1488
02:30:59.32 --> 02:31:04.80
But we get in too close to start sending them mustaches or those soldiers and Marines down

1489
02:31:04.80 --> 02:31:05.80
there.

1490
02:31:05.80 --> 02:31:11.16
And by the way, if you get too close, actually it goes way beyond sending mustaches.

1491
02:31:11.16 --> 02:31:14.52
If you go too close, you can kill from the troops and again we're back to what we just

1492
02:31:14.52 --> 02:31:15.52
thought about.

1493
02:31:15.52 --> 02:31:16.52
So that's a nightmare.

1494
02:31:16.52 --> 02:31:17.52
And it was done.

1495
02:31:17.52 --> 02:31:20.60
You know, I mean, again, the fog of war.

1496
02:31:20.60 --> 02:31:21.60
That's what happens.

1497
02:31:21.60 --> 02:31:23.60
And it's really, really unfortunate.

1498
02:31:23.60 --> 02:31:26.000
So I would get that not in my stomach.

1499
02:31:26.000 --> 02:31:32.44
When era was called in to support ground troops and in fact, you know, torch off the smoke

1500
02:31:32.44 --> 02:31:33.44
signal.

1501
02:31:33.44 --> 02:31:37.44
And I'd look at the wind and try to figure out exactly how I can get in there close.

1502
02:31:37.44 --> 02:31:43.92
And lots of times I would go below the frag pattern of the bomb I was dropping just so I could

1503
02:31:43.92 --> 02:31:46.16
get more accuracy.

1504
02:31:46.16 --> 02:31:47.16
And we all did that.

1505
02:31:47.16 --> 02:31:48.68
You know, we weren't supposed to.

1506
02:31:48.68 --> 02:31:53.44
But you know, an average bomb, you know, five in a pound bomb would have a frag pattern

1507
02:31:53.44 --> 02:31:55.80
of 2400 feet above the ground.

1508
02:31:55.80 --> 02:31:59.08
That's what you were flying through after you dropped the bomb.

1509
02:31:59.08 --> 02:32:03.56
And we'd go below that just to get more accuracy.

1510
02:32:03.56 --> 02:32:06.08
Because we knew that those guys were dependent on us.

1511
02:32:06.08 --> 02:32:08.28
And boy, there were some happy facts.

1512
02:32:08.28 --> 02:32:13.60
You know, after we, after we would support those ground troops.

1513
02:32:13.60 --> 02:32:18.76
But it was, you know, it was pretty scary stuff.

1514
02:32:18.76 --> 02:32:21.56
But back to your point about blaming other people.

1515
02:32:21.56 --> 02:32:25.20
I had a coach early on that a very losing team.

1516
02:32:25.20 --> 02:32:26.36
Sorry to say.

1517
02:32:26.36 --> 02:32:32.92
But he would, he told us this because we'd start blaming other things for the problem.

1518
02:32:32.92 --> 02:32:38.80
You know, yeah, we were away and we didn't, you know, the things weren't right.

1519
02:32:38.80 --> 02:32:42.60
And so we blamed somebody for this or somebody that had the, you know, the riffs were

1520
02:32:42.60 --> 02:32:45.20
called a bad call.

1521
02:32:45.20 --> 02:32:45.80
It's not all that stuff.

1522
02:32:45.80 --> 02:32:52.16
And he'd said, you know, said, the difference in success and failure in life is not the

1523
02:32:52.16 --> 02:32:53.48
things around you.

1524
02:32:53.48 --> 02:32:56.08
It's the choices you make about things around you.

1525
02:32:56.08 --> 02:32:59.000
And you can blame everybody else for your problems.

1526
02:32:59.000 --> 02:33:03.24
But in doing so, you give away control of your life.

1527
02:33:03.24 --> 02:33:06.36
And I think that's the accountability issue that you're talking about.

1528
02:33:06.36 --> 02:33:10.60
You know, is that there's, there's certainly freedom in discipline.

1529
02:33:10.60 --> 02:33:14.60
There's also freedom in accountability, I think, because when you, like you say, you know,

1530
02:33:14.60 --> 02:33:20.32
when you say, okay, yeah, lots of people made a lot of mistakes, but away, I was in charge.

1531
02:33:20.32 --> 02:33:23.68
And so, you know, the owners is really on me.

1532
02:33:23.68 --> 02:33:32.68
And I find that when I, when I practice taking, when I practice taking responsibility for

1533
02:33:32.68 --> 02:33:36.36
some of the bad things that really weren't my fault.

1534
02:33:36.36 --> 02:33:38.52
And I practice doing that.

1535
02:33:38.52 --> 02:33:39.84
It frees me up.

1536
02:33:39.84 --> 02:33:43.92
I think to let you know, to let a, um, freer life.

1537
02:33:43.92 --> 02:33:50.000
Yeah, that's actually an interesting point because sometimes people, they, they hear, like,

1538
02:33:50.000 --> 02:33:52.20
they'll read the book, extreme ownership that we wrote.

1539
02:33:52.20 --> 02:33:53.20
And they go, okay, cool.

1540
02:33:53.20 --> 02:33:54.80
All I need to do is take ownership of the problems.

1541
02:33:54.80 --> 02:33:56.60
And then I'm, then I'm a good guy, right?

1542
02:33:56.60 --> 02:33:59.40
They go, oh, you know, hey, these mistakes happen.

1543
02:33:59.40 --> 02:34:00.40
This is my fault.

1544
02:34:00.40 --> 02:34:02.08
You know, so let's get them fixed.

1545
02:34:02.08 --> 02:34:04.08
And that actually doesn't work.

1546
02:34:04.08 --> 02:34:09.72
Actually, and, and when I say, hey, there's all these mistakes that were made on the battlefield.

1547
02:34:09.72 --> 02:34:11.96
And different people made actual mistakes.

1548
02:34:11.96 --> 02:34:12.96
They made mistakes.

1549
02:34:12.96 --> 02:34:17.60
Though the, the day we had that blue on blue, there was other people that made mistakes.

1550
02:34:17.60 --> 02:34:20.08
What I'm saying isn't like, oh, those were my mistakes.

1551
02:34:20.08 --> 02:34:21.08
Hey, it's my fault.

1552
02:34:21.08 --> 02:34:26.04
No, no, no, what I'm saying is actually truthfully those mistakes were things that I should

1553
02:34:26.04 --> 02:34:30.60
have, for seeing that I should have understood better, that I should have planned better, that

1554
02:34:30.60 --> 02:34:33.32
I should have trained guys better for.

1555
02:34:33.32 --> 02:34:35.48
They, they, they made the mistake.

1556
02:34:35.48 --> 02:34:38.60
But the root problem of that mistake is my fault.

1557
02:34:38.60 --> 02:34:43.24
It's not just saying, hey, my boss states, it's, you know, oh, yeah, that was my fault.

1558
02:34:43.24 --> 02:34:44.96
No, no, no, and actually is my fault.

1559
02:34:44.96 --> 02:34:49.68
And I have this conversation too, where people say, well, what if I do, what do I do

1560
02:34:49.68 --> 02:34:53.20
if I tell my employees, oh, guys, it was my fault.

1561
02:34:53.20 --> 02:34:55.16
And then my employees say, yeah, that's right.

1562
02:34:55.16 --> 02:34:56.76
It was your fault.

1563
02:34:56.76 --> 02:34:58.76
And the people don't know what to do.

1564
02:34:58.76 --> 02:35:03.24
And I said, well, it is your fault.

1565
02:35:03.24 --> 02:35:04.80
That's what I'm saying.

1566
02:35:04.80 --> 02:35:08.24
I'm not saying this so that it makes people not look at you and blame no, no, and

1567
02:35:08.24 --> 02:35:11.32
someone says, if I say Charlie, we screwed up this mission.

1568
02:35:11.32 --> 02:35:12.12
It was my fault.

1569
02:35:12.12 --> 02:35:12.72
And you go, that's right.

1570
02:35:12.72 --> 02:35:13.72
It was your fault.

1571
02:35:13.72 --> 02:35:16.000
I don't go, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, that's not what

1572
02:35:16.000 --> 02:35:17.000
works.

1573
02:35:17.000 --> 02:35:19.20
I say Charlie, I was the commander of this mission.

1574
02:35:19.20 --> 02:35:20.60
I didn't give you enough information.

1575
02:35:20.60 --> 02:35:23.08
I didn't, I didn't review your plan well enough.

1576
02:35:23.08 --> 02:35:24.28
I didn't give you the training that you needed.

1577
02:35:24.28 --> 02:35:25.64
I didn't give you the support that you needed.

1578
02:35:25.64 --> 02:35:27.04
That was my fault.

1579
02:35:27.04 --> 02:35:29.36
That is what, and here is what I'm going to do to fix it.

1580
02:35:29.36 --> 02:35:32.88
So when I look at you and say, hey, this is my fault that this happened, and you say

1581
02:35:32.88 --> 02:35:33.76
you're right, it was.

1582
02:35:33.76 --> 02:35:35.16
I go exactly.

1583
02:35:35.16 --> 02:35:38.20
These are the things I'm going to do to fix it. Here's where the way we're going to do this

1584
02:35:38.20 --> 02:35:39.20
from now on.

1585
02:35:39.20 --> 02:35:42.36
Here's some procedures we're going to put in place so that this doesn't happen.

1586
02:35:42.36 --> 02:35:48.000
So yes, extreme ownership is not by any stretch on a skate patch.

1587
02:35:48.000 --> 02:35:49.000
It's not.

1588
02:35:49.000 --> 02:35:52.56
In fact, when you take ownership, you shut the hatch and you walk there.

1589
02:35:52.56 --> 02:35:54.44
You're not getting out.

1590
02:35:54.44 --> 02:35:57.84
The only way to get out is to find solution for the problems and move forward.

1591
02:35:57.84 --> 02:36:00.16
So it's an interesting, it's interesting.

1592
02:36:00.16 --> 02:36:07.72
So that brings me up to civilian life. Now you've talked about a mission and having something

1593
02:36:07.72 --> 02:36:09.44
out in front of you.

1594
02:36:09.44 --> 02:36:13.24
Well, I got off active duty in 1948, June.

1595
02:36:13.24 --> 02:36:17.44
Exactly two years before Korea started.

1596
02:36:17.44 --> 02:36:24.36
And my father and law who actually became almost like a father to me, we'd, by that

1597
02:36:24.36 --> 02:36:29.68
time, we'd been married for three years.

1598
02:36:29.68 --> 02:36:32.08
He was deeply involved in the paper industry.

1599
02:36:32.08 --> 02:36:37.60
He was president of Western wax paper here in Los Angeles.

1600
02:36:37.60 --> 02:36:42.08
He had sold the company to crown Zellor back.

1601
02:36:42.08 --> 02:36:48.80
His best friend was Richard McDonald who was an executive vice president of Crown Zellor

1602
02:36:48.80 --> 02:36:50.64
back.

1603
02:36:50.64 --> 02:36:57.48
And between the two of them, they found this little paper company.

1604
02:36:57.48 --> 02:37:01.64
And they're going to take care of their son and laws and son.

1605
02:37:01.64 --> 02:37:12.000
And so Dick McDonald got off active duty as an engineer in the army before I did.

1606
02:37:12.000 --> 02:37:18.000
So he arrived at the paper company, maybe almost a year before I did.

1607
02:37:18.000 --> 02:37:26.12
And I had put my all the money I had into this company before, well, I was still an active

1608
02:37:26.12 --> 02:37:27.12
duty.

1609
02:37:27.12 --> 02:37:31.08
So I come home in June, 48.

1610
02:37:31.08 --> 02:37:33.64
And it's 4th of July coming up.

1611
02:37:33.64 --> 02:37:40.20
And my father and law takes me down and we buy three civilian suits.

1612
02:37:40.20 --> 02:37:45.60
And all of a sudden I'm a civilian and I'm going to go work for this little company and

1613
02:37:45.60 --> 02:37:51.08
Dick McDonald was running with company because he was there a year before.

1614
02:37:51.08 --> 02:37:54.88
But we had a partner in this company.

1615
02:37:54.88 --> 02:37:57.64
And so I go down and I go to work.

1616
02:37:57.64 --> 02:38:02.12
And boy, I'm because I'm going to be technically aligned and minded.

1617
02:38:02.12 --> 02:38:07.32
They put me in charge of the operation, the plan operation.

1618
02:38:07.32 --> 02:38:11.92
So now I'm a civilian and I'm working hard.

1619
02:38:11.92 --> 02:38:13.80
And it goes for about three months.

1620
02:38:13.80 --> 02:38:18.000
And then I begin to notice that we get an order in.

1621
02:38:18.000 --> 02:38:21.64
And we, by that time we had maybe 50 employees.

1622
02:38:21.64 --> 02:38:27.04
We were making paper napkins and shelf paper and all these little items we were what was

1623
02:38:27.04 --> 02:38:29.56
called a paper converter.

1624
02:38:29.56 --> 02:38:36.24
And so I noticed in running the plant that we get an order in and I'd look at the inventory

1625
02:38:36.24 --> 02:38:41.24
and we'd had so much paper back in the inventory and I go back and check it and we ain't

1626
02:38:41.24 --> 02:38:43.52
got it.

1627
02:38:43.52 --> 02:38:44.96
And so now what's wrong?

1628
02:38:44.96 --> 02:38:49.04
And so we had a little meeting and each side, well, maybe we'd better take an inventory

1629
02:38:49.04 --> 02:38:52.56
and see what's in the back of a plant there.

1630
02:38:52.56 --> 02:39:00.64
And it turns out that our partner who actually had control of the company was definitely

1631
02:39:00.64 --> 02:39:05.48
afraid to admit that he had been losing money.

1632
02:39:05.48 --> 02:39:07.44
And he wasn't dishonest or anything.

1633
02:39:07.44 --> 02:39:09.72
He just didn't want to admit it.

1634
02:39:09.72 --> 02:39:15.96
And so to cover the losses he had inflated the inventory.

1635
02:39:15.96 --> 02:39:19.48
So now we have this big meeting.

1636
02:39:19.48 --> 02:39:23.08
90 days into being a civilian.

1637
02:39:23.08 --> 02:39:30.80
And we take the inventory and we add all this up and Dick McDonnell and I, oh, crowned

1638
02:39:30.80 --> 02:39:35.08
Zeloback Corporation about $20,000.

1639
02:39:35.08 --> 02:39:37.88
That's $19,48.

1640
02:39:37.88 --> 02:39:44.04
And let me tell you $20,000 is one hell of a lot of money.

1641
02:39:44.04 --> 02:39:45.04
Wow.

1642
02:39:45.04 --> 02:39:47.88
And this is when a house would cost what $500,000.

1643
02:39:47.88 --> 02:39:48.88
Oh, yeah.

1644
02:39:48.88 --> 02:39:49.88
Wow.

1645
02:39:49.88 --> 02:39:54.48
So now what do we do?

1646
02:39:54.48 --> 02:39:59.72
Well, the first thing we do is, well, we're welcome to the business world.

1647
02:39:59.72 --> 02:40:02.72
We work in the business world.

1648
02:40:02.72 --> 02:40:07.68
We decide that we'd better do something.

1649
02:40:07.68 --> 02:40:16.24
And our father and my father-in-law Richard McDonald's father said, well, what are you going

1650
02:40:16.24 --> 02:40:17.24
to do?

1651
02:40:17.24 --> 02:40:21.62
Well, the first thing we had to do is you had to go up and talk to Crown Zeloback

1652
02:40:21.62 --> 02:40:23.44
in San Francisco.

1653
02:40:23.44 --> 02:40:28.08
And so in order to do that, I had to buy a top coat and a hat.

1654
02:40:28.08 --> 02:40:34.60
Because you didn't go to San Francisco on a business meeting without having a hat and

1655
02:40:34.60 --> 02:40:36.48
a top coat.

1656
02:40:36.48 --> 02:40:43.48
And so we get on the train and we go to San Francisco and we're plotting the whole way up

1657
02:40:43.48 --> 02:40:44.48
there up.

1658
02:40:44.48 --> 02:40:46.04
What are we going to tell them?

1659
02:40:46.04 --> 02:40:48.32
I had no idea.

1660
02:40:48.32 --> 02:40:51.92
And I got off the train of the station up there.

1661
02:40:51.92 --> 02:40:56.48
Got a taxi and we get down to the Sanson Street to this big beautiful buildings.

1662
02:40:56.48 --> 02:40:58.64
It's Crown Zeloback.

1663
02:40:58.64 --> 02:41:02.16
And I'm wearing my hat, my new top coat.

1664
02:41:02.16 --> 02:41:07.40
And I'm going to see Mr Zeloback himself.

1665
02:41:07.40 --> 02:41:11.72
And just as I walk in the front door, some got them pinching.

1666
02:41:11.72 --> 02:41:14.40
I'll put both, let's go.

1667
02:41:14.40 --> 02:41:18.88
Right down across my brain, brand new top coat.

1668
02:41:18.88 --> 02:41:23.92
Now the world can't be any worse than this.

1669
02:41:23.92 --> 02:41:25.88
Now what are we doing?

1670
02:41:25.88 --> 02:41:32.12
Well, we had our meeting with Mr Zeloback and he was very, very, very, very, very, very, very,

1671
02:41:32.12 --> 02:41:34.72
gracious.

1672
02:41:34.72 --> 02:41:40.40
He said, was when he was going to pay us the $20,000.

1673
02:41:40.40 --> 02:41:43.000
So we said, well, we're going to work on it.

1674
02:41:43.000 --> 02:41:44.000
And we did.

1675
02:41:44.000 --> 02:41:47.60
We worked very hard for about two years.

1676
02:41:47.60 --> 02:41:54.88
And we finally began to make some money getting ahead and career started.

1677
02:41:54.88 --> 02:42:02.92
The 25th of June.

1678
02:42:02.92 --> 02:42:08.48
About a week later, the fellow walks into our office and he said, we have a problem from the

1679
02:42:08.48 --> 02:42:10.64
US government.

1680
02:42:10.64 --> 02:42:17.68
And he said, you know, we have to build up our supplies.

1681
02:42:17.68 --> 02:42:27.40
And one thing that we just can't seem to solve is toilet tissue for k-rashings.

1682
02:42:27.40 --> 02:42:33.92
Little packet toilet tissue for the little piece of paper around it too.

1683
02:42:33.92 --> 02:42:38.44
And so he said, we got one machine that belongs to one of the paper companies.

1684
02:42:38.44 --> 02:42:45.72
And he said, we got that machine working 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

1685
02:42:45.72 --> 02:42:50.48
And we're not getting enough toilet tissue into these k-rashings.

1686
02:42:50.48 --> 02:42:52.48
What can you do?

1687
02:42:52.48 --> 02:42:55.40
I don't know how in the heck you found us, but anyway you did.

1688
02:42:55.40 --> 02:42:58.92
So we took a look at it.

1689
02:42:58.92 --> 02:43:04.84
And we figured that we could go to crowns our back and get in-or-fold tissue paper.

1690
02:43:04.84 --> 02:43:12.04
And you could sit down and you could flick 20 sheets of in-or-fold, make two folds in

1691
02:43:12.04 --> 02:43:13.04
it.

1692
02:43:13.04 --> 02:43:15.08
And then we had to have a tube.

1693
02:43:15.08 --> 02:43:22.16
And so our superintendent, I went out and we bought a little machine and made a nickel

1694
02:43:22.16 --> 02:43:27.28
pack for dollars worth of nickels, a tube, 20 nickel.

1695
02:43:27.28 --> 02:43:30.64
We made the tube and we cut it in half.

1696
02:43:30.64 --> 02:43:34.28
Now we got a tube to put the 20 sheets in.

1697
02:43:34.28 --> 02:43:40.56
And so I sit down for about an hour and I fold the paper and they time me and they figured

1698
02:43:40.56 --> 02:43:44.000
it was rough as I am.

1699
02:43:44.000 --> 02:43:50.64
If I can do it that much in an hour, then a young lady could do it.

1700
02:43:50.64 --> 02:43:54.24
So we hired about 50 gals.

1701
02:43:54.24 --> 02:44:00.52
And we put them to work and making these little toilet tissue wraps and putting the tube on

1702
02:44:00.52 --> 02:44:04.88
it and throw it in a box and we put them on piecework.

1703
02:44:04.88 --> 02:44:12.36
And they were doing very well.

1704
02:44:12.36 --> 02:44:14.56
In fact, we were out producing Scott Tissue's machine almost immediately and these little

1705
02:44:14.56 --> 02:44:20.28
gals down in East Los Angeles were making more money than anybody else in East Los Angeles

1706
02:44:20.28 --> 02:44:22.08
on piecework.

1707
02:44:22.08 --> 02:44:23.64
And so everything's going great.

1708
02:44:23.64 --> 02:44:24.64
We're making money.

1709
02:44:24.64 --> 02:44:31.08
We're paying off the balance of the $20,000 way out two years later.

1710
02:44:31.08 --> 02:44:36.32
And the guy walks into the office, he came into my office and says, you know, he said,

1711
02:44:36.32 --> 02:44:41.96
we got a situation here and he had some of my, it's packs.

1712
02:44:41.96 --> 02:44:46.16
And he said, I'd like to see your operation.

1713
02:44:46.16 --> 02:44:49.96
So we took him out and planted and he picked up some of these tubes and he looked at

1714
02:44:49.96 --> 02:44:54.96
and took him apart, counted the tissues in front of me and they were all perfect.

1715
02:44:54.96 --> 02:45:00.76
And he said, I got something to show you.

1716
02:45:00.76 --> 02:45:05.32
And Paul's little notes out and he said, just read him.

1717
02:45:05.32 --> 02:45:10.28
And here's his little note written at hand writing in this tube.

1718
02:45:10.28 --> 02:45:17.12
And these young ladies have been writing these little notes and putting them inside the

1719
02:45:17.12 --> 02:45:23.32
tissue and they left nothing to your imagination.

1720
02:45:23.32 --> 02:45:36.84
And he says, can you imagine some GI in a box hole in the rain, taking this apart

1721
02:45:36.84 --> 02:45:43.84
and reading this note, how is he going to feel?

1722
02:45:43.84 --> 02:45:45.32
Oh, this is both.

1723
02:45:45.32 --> 02:45:47.64
What are we going to do?

1724
02:45:47.64 --> 02:45:51.24
What are we, he says, why don't we just leave it alone?

1725
02:45:51.24 --> 02:45:54.92
Let him keep on doing it.

1726
02:45:54.92 --> 02:45:57.48
That has to be him or own.

1727
02:45:57.48 --> 02:46:00.24
Anyway, that's how we paid off the $20.

1728
02:46:00.24 --> 02:46:07.92
So believe me, that two years are trying to pay that off.

1729
02:46:07.92 --> 02:46:15.20
That military training that I had really was very helpful.

1730
02:46:15.20 --> 02:46:22.20
It must be a museum somewhere that's looking for those two.

1731
02:46:22.20 --> 02:46:23.20
You know, I have one.

1732
02:46:23.20 --> 02:46:24.64
It's not original.

1733
02:46:24.64 --> 02:46:30.20
Somebody picked it up after it must have been for a bit long.

1734
02:46:30.20 --> 02:46:32.88
They picked it up more producing.

1735
02:46:32.88 --> 02:46:35.20
So I just, I have one of my doubts.

1736
02:46:35.20 --> 02:46:37.20
This is a reminder.

1737
02:46:37.20 --> 02:46:42.32
But it's, you know, I have an emission.

1738
02:46:42.32 --> 02:46:46.32
I got a mission real quick.

1739
02:46:46.32 --> 02:46:53.12
And it's, there was a very discouraging one to think of going $20,000 from that.

1740
02:46:53.12 --> 02:46:58.24
Well over twice what I paid for my house.

1741
02:46:58.24 --> 02:46:59.24
I just looked at my watch.

1742
02:46:59.24 --> 02:47:04.24
We've been going for about two hours and 45 minutes.

1743
02:47:04.24 --> 02:47:09.44
I say we wrap up this run echo you got anything else.

1744
02:47:09.44 --> 02:47:10.64
Have you said anything today?

1745
02:47:10.64 --> 02:47:11.64
No.

1746
02:47:11.64 --> 02:47:12.64
Okay.

1747
02:47:12.64 --> 02:47:13.64
Do you have anything to add?

1748
02:47:13.64 --> 02:47:14.64
Yeah, I do.

1749
02:47:14.64 --> 02:47:18.64
When I lived in Honolulu, I had a motor scooter as well.

1750
02:47:18.64 --> 02:47:19.64
Really?

1751
02:47:19.64 --> 02:47:20.64
Crashed it.

1752
02:47:20.64 --> 02:47:21.64
Didn't break my leg.

1753
02:47:21.64 --> 02:47:24.64
That's relating to you.

1754
02:47:24.64 --> 02:47:26.64
But yeah, they can get you.

1755
02:47:26.64 --> 02:47:32.64
You feel so free with it and you want to distance and yeah.

1756
02:47:32.64 --> 02:47:34.64
Be careful on the scooter.

1757
02:47:34.64 --> 02:47:35.64
Oh yeah, for sure.

1758
02:47:35.64 --> 02:47:36.64
Touching Honolulu.

1759
02:47:36.64 --> 02:47:37.64
Go everywhere.

1760
02:47:37.64 --> 02:47:38.64
Yep.

1761
02:47:38.64 --> 02:47:41.64
That's it.

1762
02:47:41.64 --> 02:47:42.64
Thank you both very, very much.

1763
02:47:42.64 --> 02:47:44.64
Oh, hey, proud to be with you.

1764
02:47:44.64 --> 02:47:46.64
Charlie Pum sir, anything else you want to say?

1765
02:47:46.64 --> 02:47:50.64
I think we covered it all really great being with you guys.

1766
02:47:50.64 --> 02:47:58.64
I think the transfer of our, not necessarily our knowledge but our, our war stories, but just the philosophy.

1767
02:47:58.64 --> 02:48:05.64
You know, the we're coming up with because it, it spans the test of time, I think.

1768
02:48:05.64 --> 02:48:09.64
And we'll continue to span the test of time.

1769
02:48:09.64 --> 02:48:17.64
You know, the accountability issue, the, the face your fears issue, the making choices issue,

1770
02:48:17.64 --> 02:48:25.64
the refusal to blame other people if you're a problem, you know, take control of your life and it's just not just a military thing.

1771
02:48:25.64 --> 02:48:34.64
I think it's true with, with our kids and it's true with students and politicians and all, all manners of our society.

1772
02:48:34.64 --> 02:48:42.64
Just, I think needs a, a little shot in all of the, of accountability.

1773
02:48:42.64 --> 02:48:43.64
I agree.

1774
02:48:43.64 --> 02:48:44.64
Well, I agree with that.

1775
02:48:44.64 --> 02:48:49.64
And I think that, you know, meeting Charlie and what a wonderful,

1776
02:48:49.64 --> 02:48:51.64
sport person he is.

1777
02:48:51.64 --> 02:48:59.64
He's actually got me into a position that I had to talk in front of the crowd of these times.

1778
02:48:59.64 --> 02:49:03.64
And I always try to get in first because I, I don't want to follow it.

1779
02:49:03.64 --> 02:49:07.64
People will be walking now.

1780
02:49:07.64 --> 02:49:17.64
So, well, well, they're captive by one of the talk to, but I would love to be able to read some of the, as you are doing,

1781
02:49:17.64 --> 02:49:41.64
read some of these young people who, who, who, not that, they're, just because they're not thinking the way I think, but I think they're losing something, they're losing something that this great country has given to a novel a lot of people.

1782
02:49:41.64 --> 02:49:49.64
I, I feel that I'd like to reach them and I can't, and I think you're reaching them. I think Charlie's reaching them.

1783
02:49:49.64 --> 02:49:51.64
You have to. You're reaching them.

1784
02:49:51.64 --> 02:49:54.64
But there's so much we could say.

1785
02:49:54.64 --> 02:50:01.64
And my granddaughter just graduated from the University of Michigan four years.

1786
02:50:01.64 --> 02:50:04.64
And it's pretty liberal school.

1787
02:50:04.64 --> 02:50:14.64
And we, we pay a lot of money in our center, kids to school and sometimes they get some wrong thoughts and at least I think they're wrong. Maybe they're not.

1788
02:50:14.64 --> 02:50:16.64
Maybe they're right.

1789
02:50:16.64 --> 02:50:18.64
But I don't think so.

1790
02:50:18.64 --> 02:50:33.64
And so, I think the work you're doing and Charlie's is only, and the three of you are doing is so, so important for the future.

1791
02:50:33.64 --> 02:50:38.64
Well, obviously, thank you for coming for coming on the show, both of you.

1792
02:50:38.64 --> 02:50:42.64
It's, it's such an honor to be sitting here with you guys.

1793
02:50:42.64 --> 02:50:51.64
And, and also, we wouldn't be sitting here if it wasn't, you know, for, for men like you that stood up and fought.

1794
02:50:51.64 --> 02:51:00.64
And that's why we're here. And that's why we have the freedom to be here, to do this and the freedom to try and pass that information on.

1795
02:51:00.64 --> 02:51:13.64
So people understand what kind of sacrifices were made so that we can live in this amazing country with this incredible amount of opportunity to do just about anything you want.

1796
02:51:13.64 --> 02:51:20.64
And whether that's, take care of your family or go out and build some kind of a corporate empire.

1797
02:51:20.64 --> 02:51:24.64
You can do it here and you can be happy in any one of those categories.

1798
02:51:24.64 --> 02:51:26.64
And it's amazing.

1799
02:51:26.64 --> 02:51:28.64
So thank you for coming on.

1800
02:51:28.64 --> 02:51:52.64
And again, I think if it wasn't for generations of men like you answering the call to fight, then our great nation would have perished long ago, and it would have perished to tyranny, and it would have perished to darkness.

1801
02:51:52.64 --> 02:52:00.64
But because of you and men like you, we do live in freedom.

1802
02:52:00.64 --> 02:52:05.64
And we provide hope and light to the world.

1803
02:52:05.64 --> 02:52:10.64
So thank you both for giving that to us.

1804
02:52:10.64 --> 02:52:25.64
So we wrapped up with Charlie Plum and with Jim Kunkl in the hangers.

1805
02:52:25.64 --> 02:52:28.64
I got a little off track at the end there.

1806
02:52:28.64 --> 02:52:36.64
I know that we were going to mention, at least some social media and Charlie Plum's information.

1807
02:52:36.64 --> 02:52:40.64
I failed to do that. We're now back in the studio to do that right now.

1808
02:52:40.64 --> 02:52:51.64
So if anybody wants to link up with Captain Charlie Plum, you can find him on Twitter.

1809
02:52:51.64 --> 02:52:56.64
He is at Captain Captain Plum Plum.

1810
02:52:56.64 --> 02:53:10.64
So C-A-P-T-P-L-U-M-B. That's on Twitter. He's also Charlie Plum on Facebook or you can go to CharliePlum.com if you want to get in touch with him.

1811
02:53:10.64 --> 02:53:24.64
Also, if you do want to find either myself or Echo Charles, you can find us also on Twitter, on Instagram, and also on the Facebook.

1812
02:53:24.64 --> 02:53:29.64
You can find us there. Echo is at Echo Charles and I am at Jocca Willink.

1813
02:53:29.64 --> 02:53:34.64
And if you want to support this podcast in any way, Echo, how can we do that?

1814
02:53:34.64 --> 02:53:40.64
Anyways, keep this brief. Try to origin.

1815
02:53:40.64 --> 02:53:45.64
Originmain.com main the state. So originmain.com.

1816
02:53:45.64 --> 02:53:50.64
Good stuff. You're all made in America from the cotton.

1817
02:53:50.64 --> 02:53:54.64
The actual raw cotton to the material to make it.

1818
02:53:54.64 --> 02:54:02.64
All the way into what shirts, pants, geese, is geese their flagship kind of...

1819
02:54:02.64 --> 02:54:08.64
Faction, yes. That's the origin of origin. This is to make a geese in America.

1820
02:54:08.64 --> 02:54:10.64
But now we're making all kinds of stuff.

1821
02:54:10.64 --> 02:54:13.64
It's a cool stuff anyway. Go to the website, check those ones up.

1822
02:54:13.64 --> 02:54:15.64
Compression gear. Also.

1823
02:54:15.64 --> 02:54:16.64
Yeah.

1824
02:54:16.64 --> 02:54:20.64
Now just rash guards. Yeah, compression gear.

1825
02:54:20.64 --> 02:54:24.64
Are we calling the rash guards compression gear? I don't know.

1826
02:54:24.64 --> 02:54:26.64
You were going to have to figure that one out.

1827
02:54:26.64 --> 02:54:28.64
Compression gear sort of sounds all technical.

1828
02:54:28.64 --> 02:54:32.64
Rask guards sort of the reality, the scenario, in the surfing situation.

1829
02:54:32.64 --> 02:54:34.64
Yeah. So both whatever you like.

1830
02:54:34.64 --> 02:54:38.64
You know what we mean. You know what we're coming from all that one.

1831
02:54:38.64 --> 02:54:40.64
Ultimately, yeah.

1832
02:54:40.64 --> 02:54:42.64
Also.

1833
02:54:42.64 --> 02:54:44.64
Superkrill.

1834
02:54:44.64 --> 02:54:46.64
That's Jocelyn superkrill.

1835
02:54:46.64 --> 02:54:48.64
So krill oil.

1836
02:54:48.64 --> 02:54:50.64
That's out.

1837
02:54:50.64 --> 02:54:50.64
Yeah.

1838
02:54:50.64 --> 02:54:52.64
Origin main.

1839
02:54:52.64 --> 02:54:54.64
And then you click on labs, right?

1840
02:54:54.64 --> 02:54:54.64
Yeah.

1841
02:54:54.64 --> 02:54:56.64
The labs tab.

1842
02:54:56.64 --> 02:54:56.64
And then you got a little bar.

1843
02:54:56.64 --> 02:54:58.64
You'll see it.

1844
02:54:58.64 --> 02:54:58.64
Yeah.

1845
02:54:58.64 --> 02:54:58.64
Go there.

1846
02:54:58.64 --> 02:55:00.64
Good origin main.com.

1847
02:55:00.64 --> 02:55:02.64
And then a bunch of people pre-ordered it or did it.

1848
02:55:02.64 --> 02:55:02.64
So what?

1849
02:55:02.64 --> 02:55:04.64
They should start.

1850
02:55:04.64 --> 02:55:04.64
Oh, it's made in the mail there.

1851
02:55:04.64 --> 02:55:05.64
Get in it.

1852
02:55:05.64 --> 02:55:06.64
People have it now.

1853
02:55:06.64 --> 02:55:06.64
Oh, dang.

1854
02:55:06.64 --> 02:55:07.64
Okay.

1855
02:55:07.64 --> 02:55:08.64
Yeah.

1856
02:55:08.64 --> 02:55:08.64
And yeah.

1857
02:55:08.64 --> 02:55:10.64
If you want more, you can get it there.

1858
02:55:10.64 --> 02:55:11.64
Yeah.

1859
02:55:11.64 --> 02:55:12.64
And join warfare.

1860
02:55:12.64 --> 02:55:14.64
That's a good one too.

1861
02:55:14.64 --> 02:55:16.64
So if you got this blend, you got the,

1862
02:55:16.64 --> 02:55:18.64
the, the, the double, you know,

1863
02:55:18.64 --> 02:55:20.64
situation.

1864
02:55:20.64 --> 02:55:22.64
That's ultimately the kit, right?

1865
02:55:22.64 --> 02:55:24.64
The joint maintenance.

1866
02:55:24.64 --> 02:55:25.64
Excellent.

1867
02:55:25.64 --> 02:55:26.64
It's kit.

1868
02:55:26.64 --> 02:55:27.64
That's it.

1869
02:55:27.64 --> 02:55:28.64
Yeah.

1870
02:55:28.64 --> 02:55:29.64
Boom.

1871
02:55:29.64 --> 02:55:30.64
And then yeah.

1872
02:55:30.64 --> 02:55:30.64
Like I said, geez,

1873
02:55:30.64 --> 02:55:31.64
rash guards.

1874
02:55:31.64 --> 02:55:32.64
All kinds of cool stuff.

1875
02:55:32.64 --> 02:55:33.64
Just going there.

1876
02:55:33.64 --> 02:55:34.64
And that's a good way to support.

1877
02:55:34.64 --> 02:55:36.64
Also fitness gear, kettlebells.

1878
02:55:36.64 --> 02:55:38.64
You know how like you mentioned this.

1879
02:55:38.64 --> 02:55:41.64
And I posted a little Instagram video of me.

1880
02:55:41.64 --> 02:55:43.64
I was like, you know, you said,

1881
02:55:43.64 --> 02:55:44.64
I'll random.

1882
02:55:44.64 --> 02:55:45.64
Yeah, I ran.

1883
02:55:45.64 --> 02:55:46.64
I'm walking through that.

1884
02:55:46.64 --> 02:55:47.64
I saw that Instagram.

1885
02:55:47.64 --> 02:55:49.64
That was a, I'll give you credit.

1886
02:55:49.64 --> 02:55:51.64
That was a very good Instagram video.

1887
02:55:51.64 --> 02:55:52.64
I liked it.

1888
02:55:52.64 --> 02:55:56.64
That actually, that is exactly what that was.

1889
02:55:56.64 --> 02:55:58.64
It was when you said, yeah, I keep my,

1890
02:55:58.64 --> 02:56:00.64
Yeah, I just do a snatch.

1891
02:56:00.64 --> 02:56:02.64
Yeah, I just do a clean and jerk clean and jerk.

1892
02:56:02.64 --> 02:56:02.64
Yeah.

1893
02:56:02.64 --> 02:56:03.64
So that's what it was.

1894
02:56:03.64 --> 02:56:04.64
You know, you walk by it.

1895
02:56:04.64 --> 02:56:05.64
You notice it.

1896
02:56:05.64 --> 02:56:05.64
Boom.

1897
02:56:05.64 --> 02:56:06.64
Hit it.

1898
02:56:06.64 --> 02:56:06.64
Yeah.

1899
02:56:06.64 --> 02:56:07.64
That thing was calling you out.

1900
02:56:07.64 --> 02:56:07.64
You know,

1901
02:56:07.64 --> 02:56:12.64
who's to call about who now.

1902
02:56:12.64 --> 02:56:13.64
But I will admit now that I have like the whole set.

1903
02:56:13.64 --> 02:56:14.64
Pretty much.

1904
02:56:14.64 --> 02:56:15.64
Champ.

1905
02:56:15.64 --> 02:56:16.64
Where Wolf.

1906
02:56:16.64 --> 02:56:18.64
Gorilla 72 pounds.

1907
02:56:18.64 --> 02:56:19.64
Bigfoot 90 pounds.

1908
02:56:19.64 --> 02:56:21.64
They're all out there right away.

1909
02:56:21.64 --> 02:56:23.64
You know, right where I made that video.

1910
02:56:23.64 --> 02:56:25.64
I feel the same way, is you want to walk by you.

1911
02:56:25.64 --> 02:56:26.64
You just, you kind of want to.

1912
02:56:26.64 --> 02:56:27.64
And that's good for you.

1913
02:56:27.64 --> 02:56:28.64
Yeah.

1914
02:56:28.64 --> 02:56:31.64
Unless you're all super cold and stiff and then you want

1915
02:56:31.64 --> 02:56:32.64
to grab the 90 pounds.

1916
02:56:32.64 --> 02:56:33.64
That's not good for you.

1917
02:56:33.64 --> 02:56:34.64
Go a little lighter.

1918
02:56:34.64 --> 02:56:34.64
Yeah.

1919
02:56:34.64 --> 02:56:35.64
Sure stiff.

1920
02:56:35.64 --> 02:56:36.64
Yeah.

1921
02:56:36.64 --> 02:56:36.64
Anyway.

1922
02:56:36.64 --> 02:56:40.04
Anyway, point there being a digress.

1923
02:56:40.04 --> 02:56:44.16
Anyway, I get my kettlebells from on it.

1924
02:56:44.16 --> 02:56:46.16
So, kettlebells are cool.

1925
02:56:46.16 --> 02:56:48.72
Of course, I'm not going to go into a whole kettlebell thing.

1926
02:56:49.96 --> 02:56:50.80
No, I'm not going to.

1927
02:56:50.80 --> 02:56:52.80
But if you want the cooler kettlebells

1928
02:56:52.80 --> 02:56:55.92
that kettlebells the artistic ones,

1929
02:56:55.92 --> 02:56:57.08
I like the on-it ones.

1930
02:56:58.32 --> 02:56:59.68
The brunt, where we'll find out

1931
02:56:59.68 --> 02:57:01.72
because my favorite one is dope.

1932
02:57:01.72 --> 02:57:02.88
You can get the regular ones too.

1933
02:57:02.88 --> 02:57:04.36
Anyway, also a bunch of other stuff,

1934
02:57:04.36 --> 02:57:06.76
the maces, battle ropes, like any kind of,

1935
02:57:07.88 --> 02:57:10.96
kind of the functional train is,

1936
02:57:10.96 --> 02:57:12.44
we call it functional stuff.

1937
02:57:12.44 --> 02:57:13.28
Functional.

1938
02:57:13.28 --> 02:57:15.000
It's functional, and it's, I guess,

1939
02:57:15.000 --> 02:57:17.000
the word is fitness, even though I don't like that word.

1940
02:57:17.000 --> 02:57:18.80
That's why I was kind of asking for something.

1941
02:57:18.80 --> 02:57:20.96
It's a functional training, I guess.

1942
02:57:20.96 --> 02:57:22.88
Hardcore functional training.

1943
02:57:22.88 --> 02:57:24.68
Yeah, there is some cool stuff on there.

1944
02:57:24.68 --> 02:57:26.24
And all the info behind it too.

02:57:26.24 --> 02:57:27.92
Anyway, on it.com slash juggle,

02:57:58.60 --> 02:58:00.08
Yeah, go on, I'll do it.

1960
02:58:00.08 --> 02:58:01.16
Oh yeah, it's gonna do it.

So nonetheless, go to jugglepodcast.com,

1962
02:58:04.08 --> 02:58:05.36

boom, click through there when you get your books.

It brings you to Amazon and, and,

1966
02:58:10.60 --> 02:58:12.16
could you do another shopping?

1967
02:58:12.16 --> 02:58:13.08
You sure could.

1968
02:58:13.08 --> 02:58:13.92
Like it.

1969
02:58:13.92 --> 02:58:18.20
Let us in, duct tape, ear, earphones.

1970
02:58:18.20 --> 02:58:20.72
Sarah Armstrong bought something big.

1971
02:58:20.72 --> 02:58:21.96
I forget what.

1972
02:58:21.96 --> 02:58:22.80
A lot more.

1973
02:58:22.80 --> 02:58:23.92
A lot more.

1974
02:58:23.92 --> 02:58:25.92
If you need a lot more, definitely.

1975
02:58:25.92 --> 02:58:26.76
Yeah.

1976
02:58:26.76 --> 02:58:27.60
It was on click through.

1977
02:58:27.60 --> 02:58:28.44
Good way to support.

1978
02:58:28.44 --> 02:58:29.28
Very good way.

1979
02:58:29.28 --> 02:58:30.64

Also, on YouTube, put some excerpts on there.

1984

Put one out the other day.

1985
02:58:45.24 --> 02:58:46.08
Good one.

1986
02:58:47.44 --> 02:58:48.28
Very shareable.

1987
02:58:48.28 --> 02:58:49.64
But nonetheless,

02:58:49.64 --> 02:58:51.16

how should I say?

1993
02:59:00.32 --> 02:59:04.20
Other creative short films by one echo Charles.

1994
02:59:04.20 --> 02:59:05.44
Sure.

1995
02:59:05.44 --> 02:59:08.12
With people that we know acting in them.

1996
02:59:08.12 --> 02:59:09.44
Yes.

1997
02:59:09.44 --> 02:59:10.76
Sometimes.

1998
02:59:10.76 --> 02:59:12.56
But yeah, some value there.

1999
02:59:12.56 --> 02:59:14.56
Anyway, yeah, YouTube, subscribe to YouTube.

2000
02:59:14.56 --> 02:59:15.24
That's a good way.

2001
02:59:15.24 --> 02:59:16.76
Also, jocos, a store.

2002
02:59:16.76 --> 02:59:18.84
It's called jocosdore.jocosdore.com.

2003
02:59:18.84 --> 02:59:22.04
There are some good shirts on there.

2004
02:59:22.04 --> 02:59:22.60
Literally.

2005
02:59:22.60 --> 02:59:23.44
Literally.

2006
02:59:24.80 --> 02:59:26.12
Sure, this is good backwards.

2007
02:59:26.12 --> 02:59:28.96
Anyway, I'm not saying to buy something,

2008
02:59:28.96 --> 02:59:30.96
just go on there, check out stuff.

2009
02:59:30.96 --> 02:59:33.40
If you like the stuff on there, get something.

2010
02:59:33.40 --> 02:59:36.000
This stuff for women, shirts, patches,

2011
02:59:36.000 --> 02:59:37.92
rashguards, hoodies,

2012
02:59:39.44 --> 02:59:41.76
any day now, the hoodies are,

2013
02:59:41.76 --> 02:59:43.48
they're heavier,

2014
02:59:43.48 --> 02:59:44.32
yes.

2015
02:59:44.32 --> 02:59:45.48
And I'm gonna put some new ones.

2016
02:59:45.48 --> 02:59:46.88
I have a vest.

2017
02:59:46.88 --> 02:59:49.12
They're, well, here's the thing.

2018
02:59:49.12 --> 02:59:50.28
But they have a vest.

2019
02:59:51.72 --> 02:59:54.60
So I'm going through the options, you know,

2020
02:59:54.60 --> 02:59:57.64
how there's one that's like too heavy.

2021
02:59:57.64 --> 02:59:59.04
And it's like super expensive.

2022
02:59:59.04 --> 03:00:00.04
You've never been to Michigan.

2023
03:00:00.04 --> 03:00:02.56
They're like, you've never been to Maine.

2024
03:00:02.56 --> 03:00:03.92
Yeah, well, I have.

2025
03:00:03.92 --> 03:00:05.04
Oh, there you have been to Maine.

2026
03:00:05.04 --> 03:00:05.88
You've never been to Maine.

2027
03:00:05.88 --> 03:00:06.72
You've never been to Maine.

2028
03:00:06.72 --> 03:00:07.72
It wasn't that cool.

2029
03:00:07.72 --> 03:00:08.84
Yeah, and I get it.

2030
03:00:08.84 --> 03:00:10.88
Um, put it this way.

2031
03:00:10.88 --> 03:00:14.44
I'm convinced for whatever that's worth.

2032
03:00:14.44 --> 03:00:16.44
I'm convinced this is the appropriate one.

2033
03:00:16.44 --> 03:00:17.28
Okay.

2034
03:00:17.28 --> 03:00:18.12
That's what I think.

2035
03:00:18.12 --> 03:00:22.28
Well, we, meaning everyone that listens to this

2036
03:00:22.28 --> 03:00:25.12
and myself, we will be the judge of that.

2037
03:00:25.12 --> 03:00:28.36
Especially people that are from the north of America.

2038
03:00:28.36 --> 03:00:29.36
Yeah.

2039
03:00:29.36 --> 03:00:31.36
Oh, our Canada.

2040
03:00:31.36 --> 03:00:32.36
Sure.

2041
03:00:32.36 --> 03:00:33.36
The northern region.

2042
03:00:33.36 --> 03:00:34.36
I got you.

2043
03:00:34.36 --> 03:00:35.36
And I'm confident.

2044
03:00:35.36 --> 03:00:36.36
Excellent.

2045
03:00:36.36 --> 03:00:37.36
Yeah, just keep me the feedback.

2046
03:00:37.36 --> 03:00:38.36
Oh, good.

2047
03:00:38.36 --> 03:00:39.36
We will.

2048
03:00:39.36 --> 03:00:43.40
Also, psychological warfare on your journey.

2049
03:00:43.40 --> 03:00:47.04
Slash campaign against weakness.

2050
03:00:47.04 --> 03:00:49.72
If you run into those days where you're not feeling like it

2051
03:00:49.72 --> 03:00:54.52
and that's affecting you, where you're led to make or potentially make

2052
03:00:54.52 --> 03:01:00.92
the decision to slack hit the snooze, skip the workout, cheat on the

2053
03:01:00.92 --> 03:01:07.24
diet, procrastinate more or other forms of weakness.

2054
03:01:07.24 --> 03:01:13.44
You listen to this album with tracks, jockel tracks, telling you

2055
03:01:13.44 --> 03:01:21.56
pragmatically why you shouldn't give into those weaknesses.

2056
03:01:21.56 --> 03:01:28.36
The results do not vary 100% success rate on that one in my experience.

2057
03:01:28.36 --> 03:01:33.48
Psychological warfare on iTunes, Amazon, music, anywhere where they sell MP3s.

2058
03:01:33.48 --> 03:01:34.96
It's a good one.

2059
03:01:34.96 --> 03:01:35.96
Very effective.

2060
03:01:35.96 --> 03:01:37.96
Good way to support as well.

2061
03:01:37.96 --> 03:01:44.04
Also, on Amazon, jockel white tea, you can get that through Amazon.

2062
03:01:44.04 --> 03:01:45.80
You just search jockel white tea.

2063
03:01:45.80 --> 03:01:49.48
Then you order it and then you drink it and you start throwing things around

2064
03:01:49.48 --> 03:01:51.68
and smashing everything around you.

2065
03:01:51.68 --> 03:01:52.68
That's what it does.

2066
03:01:52.68 --> 03:01:53.68
No big deal.

2067
03:01:53.68 --> 03:01:54.88
Be prepared.

2068
03:01:54.88 --> 03:01:56.92
Do have some books there too.

2069
03:01:56.92 --> 03:01:59.72
You can get them way the warrior kid.

2070
03:01:59.72 --> 03:02:01.88
That's a kid's book.

2071
03:02:01.88 --> 03:02:02.88
Extreme ownership.

2072
03:02:02.88 --> 03:02:04.76
That's a book about leadership.

2073
03:02:04.76 --> 03:02:07.68
Displaning goes freedom field manual.

2074
03:02:07.68 --> 03:02:09.88
That comes out October 17th.

2075
03:02:09.88 --> 03:02:16.80
It's a book about getting after it for a lack of a better word.

2076
03:02:16.80 --> 03:02:19.46
Now what's interesting about this is the book is the

2077
03:02:19.46 --> 03:02:25.58
book is not going to be available through audible itself.

2078
03:02:25.58 --> 03:02:34.70
It's going to be available through MP3 platforms such as iTunes, Google Play,

2079
03:02:34.70 --> 03:02:37.30
what other platforms are there.

2080
03:02:37.30 --> 03:02:41.58
Amazon, Prime, music, music.

2081
03:02:41.58 --> 03:02:42.78
That's what's going to be available.

2082
03:02:42.78 --> 03:02:46.70
The reason we did that is that the beats that we could instead of just make it a big

2083
03:02:46.70 --> 03:02:57.34
long multi-hour drone of talking, it's cut up as an album with tracks.

2084
03:02:57.34 --> 03:03:04.34
Which seems to be the way that way you can utilize it for just quick listening for almost

2085
03:03:04.34 --> 03:03:06.94
like you'd use psychological warfare album.

2086
03:03:06.94 --> 03:03:07.94
Yeah.

2087
03:03:07.94 --> 03:03:09.94
It's a manual that's why.

2088
03:03:09.94 --> 03:03:10.94
It's not like this.

2089
03:03:10.94 --> 03:03:11.94
No, it's not a story.

2090
03:03:11.94 --> 03:03:12.94
No, it's not a story.

2091
03:03:12.94 --> 03:03:13.94
No, it's not a story.

2092
03:03:13.94 --> 03:03:14.94
Yes.

2093
03:03:14.94 --> 03:03:20.58
It's not like it's a simple freedom field manual is not a story.

2094
03:03:20.58 --> 03:03:22.98
It's a field manual.

2095
03:03:22.98 --> 03:03:23.98
It's instructions.

2096
03:03:23.98 --> 03:03:27.66
So you can get that there for your business.

2097
03:03:27.66 --> 03:03:30.14
Esslon front leadership.

2098

2102
03:03:44.46 --> 03:03:45.62
We appreciate it.

2103
03:03:45.62 --> 03:03:51.94
And thanks to everyone for your support and mostly for listening to the podcast, especially

2104
03:03:51.94 --> 03:03:59.54
those that are out there in uniform that provide the freedom and protection that we will

2105
03:03:59.54 --> 03:04:04.30
never take for granted.

2106
03:04:04.30 --> 03:04:14.42
Freedom that men like Charlie Plum and Jim Kunkel fought and sacrificed to uphold for us.

2107
03:04:14.42 --> 03:04:20.42
And I would simply ask everyone to make something out of the freedom that you have.

2108
03:04:20.42 --> 03:04:23.70
Don't waste it.

2109
03:04:23.70 --> 03:04:28.58
And the way that you get the most out of your freedom, I'll tell you that what way that

2110
03:04:28.58 --> 03:04:32.42
is the way you get the most out of your freedom is discipline.

2111
03:04:32.42 --> 03:04:35.82
That's how you get the most out of your freedom.

2112
03:04:35.82 --> 03:04:44.38
Push yourself hard, get things done, create and build and make yourself the best you

2113
03:04:44.38 --> 03:04:47.38
can.

2114
03:04:47.38 --> 03:04:58.22
In everything that you do, but getting out there and getting after it.

2115
03:04:58.22 --> 03:05:10.50
So until next time this was Mr. Jim Kunkel Captain Charlie Plum and Echo and

2116
03:05:10.50 --> 03:05:14.36
Zach McCunejoz out.
