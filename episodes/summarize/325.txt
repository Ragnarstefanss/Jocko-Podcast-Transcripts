and that's at the officer eats last that is is similar in that leaders eat last that's as it should be you know as it should be fast forward a little bit calling the young men together high backbone scolded them for causing the ambush to fail this is after they obviously just failed on an ambush the young men listened without protests as he reminded them that fighting the whites was not a war for glory but a war for survival you reminded them of sand creek when he finished there was a loud affirmation but an even louder one came after he announced his plan for another ambush most of the fighting men would hide themselves and their horses in the ridges and gullies on either side of the wagon trail from prairie dog Greek to lodge trail ridge a small group would attack the wood gathers who always went out from the fort by wagon in the morning when the soldiers came out to drive the attackers away 10 decoys would show themselves and lead them toward lodge trail ridge and then north down us down to a slope ending in a meadow before prairie dog creek when the signal was given the hiding warriors were attacked and not before or and not before or the ambush would be spoiled the soldiers had to believe that only 10 doig decoys were fighting them most important to the plan were the decoys if they failed several hundred fighting men would be denied the opportunity for victory therefore the decoys needed a strong leader one skilled in warfare with proven judgment in battle the leader of the decoys would be crazy horse the cries and shelter affirmation rang through camp and fighting man young and old crowded around to put their names in as one of the other nine they do some preparation then the attack came well away from the fort but still within sight so the Lakota could be sea surrounding the wax could be seen surrounding the wagon so these are the decoys going in action after initial charge the attackers kept the wagon men and escort riders engaged the gunfire sounded especially sharp in the frigid mountain air soon the western gates swung open a column of mounted and walking soldiers appeared the Lakota attackers kept up the firing making sure the rescue column was well out of the fort as the soldiers passed their thicket crazy horse and his decoys charged so this is like going as perfect to plan as it could go fortunately enough of the decoys fortunately enough of the decoys had a few bullets that they could fire several shots to make it seem like an all-out attack crazy horse shot a few arrows when he was close enough to see the hairy faces of some of the soldiers for some moments the soldiers seemed confused then they finally opened fire uneven snow covered the cover over the frozen ground and dangerously frigid air with the decoys decore warriors first obstacles and bullets humming past them like angry bees reminded them that they had a daunting task ahead and a long way to finish it the first few mounted soldiers turned off the trail to pursue them and the rest of the column fell and slowly behind them fainting head on charges the decoys would swerve at the last moment well within range of the soldier guns they took the soldier north the soldiers north over the frozen snow fields at one point some of the decoys including crazy horse had to ride down a treacherously steep frozen slope the soldiers took the gentler slope of the south face and kept pursuing an open valley with thick stand of trees on either side of the creek lay ahead with no serious obstacles to impede the soldier's advance once across the creek the warriors turned straight north and came inside of large trail ridge the walking soldiers were slowing down the column crazy horse dismounted well within rifle range pulled out a knife and calmly scraped the ice from the bottom of his horses hooves when bullets began to ricochet closer and closer he remounted and loped away the other decoys to infuriate the soldiers used similar tactics fast forward a little bit on the ridge i think i want to say i read that this was about a multi mile like a five mile trail they had to make a move five miles they had to get pursued for five miles on the ridge the soldiers hesitated perhaps waiting for some to catch up the decoys renewed their efforts coaxing their tired horses part way up the slope moving dangerously close one pretended to be shot off his horse and immediately bounced up running behind the horse before skillfully remounting from the back crazy horse had picked the right men for the task at hand for crazy horse and the decoys this was the decisive moment if the waiting ambushers attacked prematurely soldiers could still escape the decoys looked left and right as they proceeded north along a very narrow part of the ridge but could see no movement below the slope of the ridge falling away before them was the winding prairie dog creek and the end of their task now the soldiers were pressing harder increasing their gunfire obviously certain that the decoys comprised the entire enemy force crazy horse formed his men into a skirmish line and those with bullets had sp- with bullets to spare fired at the oncoming soldiers drawing into a heavy drawing in heavy return fire the decoys raced their horses down the slippery slope forming two lines as they rode they crossed the flats to prairie dog creek east line of riders swinging out wide and then crossing each other on the opposite side of the creek this was the signal to attack from out of the very earth itself came the awaiting ambushers horses and men burst from the gullies cutbacks and what little winter shrubbery was there in a heartbeat several hundred fighting men rose road south some from the east and some from the west those closest to lodge trail ridge quickly shut the soldiers escape route back to the fort the soldiers advanced stopped then they instinctively began to fight their to fight to reach the safety of the fort the walking soldiers were shrung out to the back closer to lodge trail ridge they were the first to fall as gunfire blasted up the slopes below them there was no end of the guns firing the soldiers fought hard as they retreated up the ridge but there was nothing to be gained they were cut off with nowhere to go wave after wave of the mounted warriors fought their way up the treacherous slopes those with guns used up their bullets and then resorted to their bows some had only bows and arrows arrows flew up from the east slope and from the west the sky was dark with them and some found their mark in the body of a Lakota or Sahila toward the end the warriors waited in among the dead and dying soldiers killing them with a pistol shot or a hard skillful swing of a war club or the deadly thrust of a lance and then always quiet all the soldiers were dead it began with the Sahilia as they remembered sand creek and what had been done to their relatives when the frenzy ended the soldiers were stripped naked fingers were chopped off belly slashed open eyes gouged out many warriors were wounded but fewer than 15 had been killed kind of a kind of a perfect operation really but then who's going to protect them and that's where this is where the guys is so honorable because he just he knows where his responsibility is it's not like how many soldiers I can kill because he can kill quite a few more and he can probably you know inspire a bunch of the young men on the thing to to to rise up but to what end and at the end of the the day it's the women and children they're going to suffer so then he's like I gotta try and fix this and negotiate the best deal that he can at that point so he starts to put to deal together lieutenant Lee the soldier leader in charge at spotted tails agency sent word that crazy horse must come to the soldier house crazy horse rode out with touch the clouds and white thunder spotted tail and over a hundred of his young men met them on the trail Lee arrived with black crow and Louis Bordeaux and was frightened seeing that he was between the minicondue and the aglala on one side and spotted tails on the other there were shouts and threats hurled back and forth and weapons brandished until crazy horse raised a hand in silence slowly fell over the gathering Lee now very frightened told crazy horse that he must return to Robinson and make it good with the soldier leaders there so the night past the morning came when the sun arose he hurried to the soldier house to speak to lieutenant Lee to assure him that he had not changed his mind there's ready to speak with Randall he was one of the leaders to make things good so with touch the clouds swift bear and black crow along they started out for camp Robinson the first group of blue coded Lakota men met them along the trail they said nothing informed a wide half circle around crazy horse and the others further on more blue coded Lakota arrived and now they became a mob of more than 60 it was then that crazy horse knew he was in trouble so now you have Lakota's that are wearing the the military the American military jacket fast thunder was lost in the crowd so tour he dog and touch the clouds all around was noise of running and scuffling as if men were pushing together crazy horse was pushed toward a square house made of logs a strange place for Randall the Bee before he could help himself he was through the open doorway there was a bad smell a man with dark hair and braids rose from the corner then he saw the iron bars he spun on a heel and saw man little big man blocking the opening crazy horse shoved the shorter man aside and tried to push past but almost immediately felt little big man grab both of his arms from behind with a great effort he pulled himself free and reached into the opening of his blanket for the knife outside there were shouts of both soldiers and the Lakota let me go he said a little big man let me go the man the oglala warrior who had written in a battle with him stood fast perhaps it was the blue coat of the soldier that had turned his heart with a sudden swipe crazy horse slashed the arm of the coat and immediately blood flowed and little big man jump back with a step crazy horse was outside and there was movement everywhere more hands grabbed at him from either side brown hands holding him fast the strident voice of a soldier yelled from the middle of the confusion came a soldier frusting with the knife at the end of his rifle those near him heard crazy horse gasp and saw his knees begin to wobble brown hands still holding his arms even as the soldier with drew the long knife let me go they heard him say quietly you've gotten me hurt then he fell and crazy horse died a few hours later it details that in the book and feel and his dream the dream that he had became fulfilled and again it it makes me think about that that quote that native American quote from that podcast with with Mike afanke that the diagnosis is a curse and this seems to be something similar when you know that thing when we're driving go through that driving course and they warn you when you're going through like a tactical driving course and you're driving around the track or you're driving in an out of traffic you're doing these things and they warn you they give you a warning they say when you're driving if you look at something you need what you need to look at is the opening you need to look at the part of the track that you can drive you need to look at the part of this this road that you can go through that you can make it through because if you look at another car or you look at a guardrail or you look at a ditch that's where you're going that's where you're going to end up we go where we aim and I don't know this is a self fulfilling prophecy here I mean obviously we've all heard of sitting bull and so he has incredible amount of influence and he's starting to try and gather people up and unite them a little bit so that starts to take place more and more people arrived almost every day the horse herb was growing and eating down the sparse grass around the butts some of the men said perhaps there was many as 7,000 head sitting bulls already at work inviting the older leaders to his lodge he was an impressive and charismatic man a slight limp from a gunshot wound to his hip during his days a young fighting man served only to give him more credibility he had earned nearly 70 battle honors more than any man at the gathering except crazy horse now past the age of 50 he had a solid reputation as a wise leader and counselor enhanced by his status as a medicine man he was immensely pleased at the response to his message and announced he would conduct a Sundance spiritually as well as psychologically it was the right thing at the right time it could only serve to unify the people and add to the feelings of strength and pride that seemed to be growing as quickly as the horse herd it was that kind of insight that made him an influential leader the camp movement moved west across the powder and the tongue into the valley of the rose bud and across it as well turning at the northern slopes of the wolf mountains into the broken country near the greasy grass river while sitting bull was hard at work for the hearts and minds the people crazy horse scouts and all directions feeling among the military leaders was that the biggest threat laid to lay to the south from three stars army and this book does not have a ton of detail about the battle at rose bud or really the battle at little big horn those are detailed pretty well in the book I fought with custard and also in the book wooden leg um but there is sort of a debriefing here on some of the things that went that went down going to the book the rose bug bud fight as the battle came to be known was the toughest combat crazy horse had seen the battle of hundred and hand ten years earlier that was when they surrounded those soldiers and killed the bird the battle of the hundred in the hand ten years earlier had had its own set of circumstances that made it tough but at the rose bud Lakota the Lakota faced a larger and more heavily armed enemy force three stars soldiers were both infantry and cavalry forcing Lakota to adjust to different tactics as the fighting progressed attack was met with counter attack as the day war on the valley of the rose bud funded with gunfire and dust hung in the air laid in the afternoon who is evident that the soldiers were disorganized fighting and scattered units their effectiveness significantly reduced crazy horse was notified even though nearly a hundred had arrived at mid-morning the Lakota and sahila were critically low on ammunition sensing that three stars wouldn't be able to mount any pursuit crazy horse sent the word to withdraw crazy horse rode with he dog big road and good weasel among others as they once again chased dusk into night there was no pursuit from the soldiers to speak of the feverish after math of combat slowly faded as the reality of the day began to take hold ten good men in been killed and many wounded in a day or two the the scouts crazy horse had left behind would report on the soldiers so that's the first big battle that they engage is that battle at rose bud and we'll go to the book the sides of the council lodging and rolled up to allow cross ventilation a few men were waiting in anticipation meeting with sitting bull women had already brought food sitting bull had been busy through most of the night attending to a gravely ill woman he arrived at the council lodged just as a slight den of commotion came from the south end of the encampment where he had just been a lone Lakota rider splashed across the greasy grass filled bank to bank with the heavy spring runoff from the mountain snows gaining the west bank he began to shout prepare yourselves the soldiers are coming the soldiers are coming and this is when we get into the little big horn battle the soldiers across the river far to the south near the mouth vash creek can try to gallop tried galloping their horses across the long open flood plain toward the south end of the encampment they had been quickly driven back and then chased across the river many were killed at the water crossing after heavy fighting in some trees near the river as far as crazy horse and the other leaders were concerned that was the first fight gall of the hunk papa and ol and ogala battle leaders black moon and big road were among those who had courageously led 200 fighting men in that action the second fight started at medicine tail kooley more soldiers had tried to cross into the encampment from the north end but were stopped by a small determined group of boys and old men armed mostly with old single shot rifles by then many of the women children old people were fleeing to the northwest somehow worded reached crazy horse and gall of the second attempted incursion gall immediately disengaged from the first fight and let a hundred men to medicine tail and crossed the soldiers galloped away up a long slope to the north crazy horse at hurried to to his lodge and found black shawl that's his wife waiting with his second war horse the camp was in total confusion not only were women and children running away to safety men were galloping through to hurried to the second fight shouts and screams filled the air gunshots could be heard to the south and now thinly to the north he took a second war horse and gall there is many men as to him as he could if a second group of soldiers was heading north they could be circling to attack from another direction it made sense to try and flank them so he led the men who were with him to an old crossing guessing the soldiers would stay on the high ground he had crossed the river and raised to meet them if they came off the end of the high north south ridge where he knew they laid to the east on the slopes across the river they circled to the east and encountered 20 or so soldiers whom they chased back to the main body the gunfire never stopped he heard it as they crossed the river a continuous sound rather like someone tearing canvas gall and his men crazy horse heard later stayed in pursuit of the running soldiers even though they did not gain a ridge at first the soldiers were organized even managing to dismount and form skirmish lines to fire at the oncoming Lakota but galls relentless pursuit broke their lines and after that they were running away and their fire was no longer effective crazy horse led a charge when the soldiers tried to push north off their ridge by then gunfire was thinning it was sporadic I like you he comes in and he finds all the mutilated women like how do you put that fire out now it's gonna be rough there's a guy named harney the gizapp caramel maybe a general general general harney early in the morning soldiers had been seen moving up blue water spotted tail and iron shell and a few warrior leaders rode out under a white banner to talk of troops to talk the leader of the soldiers was a white haired man and bearded older man who said his name was general harney and they eventually put two and two together that this is the guy that led this raid or did come harney had stopped at Fort Laramie since he was the leader of the soldiers he declared an end to trading with the Lakota still demanding the surrender of the killers of grapon when the story of the attack on little funders camp on the on the blue water was carried north to the other Lakota camps general harney was given a new name to the Lakota he would always be known as woman killer so the fact that they're given him that specific name probably is an indicator that that's not common practice for them to kill him no that's not saying there's our oeze man that there were violate big time one evening he returned from a long outing with high backbone and waited for his father in the large large when crazy horse that's the dad returned the boy held out a bundle of tobacco it was a gift and offering to a holy man when one needed to speak from one's heart light hair needed to tell of a dream a dream that it come to him the second night he had spent alone on a sandstone bluff it had been with him every day and night for these many months he told his father dreams were important crazy horse said as he as he took the offering of tobacco from his oldest son so now we get into this dream the dream was not difficult to remember and this dream is like the central theme of this book so the dream was not difficult to remember only to tell it had been a part of the boy since the late summer night near the sand hill country when old conquering beer bear lay dying in camp after the incident with the soldiers with the soldier gratin in his men he was almost embarrassed to describe it the dream began at a lake a small still lake bursting upward from the blue calmness a horse and its writer broke through the surface and rode out across the land the writer was a man a slender man who wore his hair loose a stone was tied behind his left ear a reddish brown stone a lightning mark was painted across one side of his face on his bare chest were blue hailstones behind him behind them to the west as they galloped was a dark rolling cloud rising higher and higher from it came the deep rumble of thunder and flashes of lightning the horse was strong and swift and changed its colors red yellow black white and blue bullets and arrows suddenly filled the air flying at the horse and writer so he goes on to this section here that speaking of anger and fear and arrogance there's a there's a cow that wanders into this camp and it says it was into conquering bears camp that an old foot sore cow wandered on especially hot afternoon the Lakota didn't own any cattle of course so it was correctly assumed that she had been lost or abandoned by some white man trying to escape the barking dogs she was running between lodges knocking over meat racks after the loft or stop someone realized that although old and thin she was fresh meat so they you know they kill a cow word of the predicament spread quickly through the camps because now someone's mad i think believe it was a Mormon they call it they keep calling the Mormon man a Mormon man wanted the cow he's complaining the soldiers that is cow had been stolen so word of the predicament quickly spread through the camps the next afternoon the soldiers started from the fort in two wagons and with two wagon guns but the man leading them was not flemming this is one of the soldiers that they had worked with or knew it was one called gratin a new officer lately come from the east with him was a man married to a Lakota woman a speaks white brought along to translate gratin it was later learned had been loud about his disdain for the Lakota so you got now an arrogant guy that's also afraid and when the soldiers reached his camp conquering bear left his lodged to meet them even as they jumped from the wagons and formed two lines facing the camp the old man was still trying to stop the trouble but his efforts were ignored meanwhile the speaks white road up and down the line of soldiers shouting threats in Lakota south of the camp hidden in low shrubbery light hair and lone bear so you got young crazy horse and his little buddy watched the old man and strained to hear him but couldn't gratin stepped down from his horse and helped load one of the wagon guns aimed into the camp the officer shouted the wagon gun blasted and all movement seemed to come to a stop but for a heartbeat the tops of a lodged lodges poles splintered into many pieces then the soldiers aimed their rifles and fired before the echo from the wagon gun had faded a astonished and unable to immediately perceive the reality unfolding before their eyes the two boys watched conquering bear fall back struck in the chest and stomach the second wagon gun boomed and then the Lakota men reacted before the soldiers could reload their rifles to fire again a few Lakota guns boomed arrows flew and then angry men ran toward the scattering soldiers gratin was one of the first to fall so like that's how things kind of start to go bad in the world it's like a little misunderstanding then you have that anger that fear that arrogance and initially they tried at some point prior to this whole thing break and I'm like so that happens um and eventually he says this what was left of the largest gathering ever of Lakota separated in several encampments moving along the eastern foothills of the shining mountain soon after the departure from Greece he grasped small groups began breaking away to head for the agencies sitting bull like crazy horse was deeply disappointed because they were losing the strength of numbers despite the best efforts of sitting bull the people scattered some made excuses saying it was time to hunt and make meat for the coming winter which was more difficult now because of the scarcity of buffalo others on a bashly headed for the agencies sitting bull finally headed north to more familiar territory crazy horse took his people east to the black hills finding a sheltered valley northwest of the mountains to hide the camps from there he led raids into the black hills there that continues for a while and this is all he does a great job in the book of just this kind of torment and anguish that that crazy horse is going through as as he sees what's happening at some point dull knife another one of his friends informed crazy horse that he was forced to consider living giving in to life on the agency if it meant his people would be safe from facing continual conflict with the long knives the idea was debated long and frequently strangely an opportunity presented itself when messengers arrived bringing word to from three stars who had been given assurance that the wild Lakota would be allowed to select the location for their own agencies if they signed a piece agreement the only drawback was that included an agreement to sell to the sale of the black hills and spite of deep seated suspicions crazy horse agreed that this important issue should be discussed face to face with the long knives crazy horse and a law large detachment of warriors escorted the delegation north to the fort on the elk river a group of crow scouts met the emissaries just outside the walls of the fort making friendly gestures to indicate their peacefulness as the eight Lakota road past them toward the gate weapons were drawn suddenly and the crow open fire at point blank range on the unarmed Lakota and then fled on horseback crazy horse charged down from the bluff but stopped when mounted soldiers emerge emerge from the fort instinctively the Lakota emissaries turn their horses and gallop for the safety of the bluffs and protection of the escort warriors only three rejoined the warriors five laid dead on the ground near the gates in the fort but as he rode away some notice that she watched until he was out of sight warm spoke and there's there's some some talk about what was going to happen with black buffalo woman there's obviously a rekindling of this thing of this relationship of this this uh this love at first sight that they had had warm spoke nonetheless because much wrote on the shoulders of his son much that was important to the people they will not let her go he said quietly fast forward a little bit one morning after victory dances whispers flew through camp black buffalo woman had left her children with relatives and rode out beside the light-haired one no two people could agree over this new turn some said it was a coming for a long time since her father had made the choice of a husband for her when her heart belonged to the shy quiet young man who is now the most powerful warrior among them others said there would be trouble though she was a good Lakota woman free to choose her husband was not one to let her have that choice besides the reasons her father and uncle had influenced her choice of a husband were even more important now some said cautiously and they were right the couple and their friends came to a small camp in a narrow little valley and there they rested little shield he dogs brother and little big man were among were along and made a feast as night fell there came a commotion and a man torn into the lodge where crazy horse and black buffalo woman were guests a man worn from a hard trail and driven by anger of a jealous heart no water stood above them a pistol in hand as crazy horse leap to his feet the pistol boomed so got a little love triangle going on no water's not happy and maybe I didn't cover it but the tradition was if the woman wanted a divorce she could do that he was up to her and and the man was supposed to respect it but everyone kind of knew that no water was not the kind of guy that was going to let this slide it appears that there's like there's a lot of politics involved with this marriage and it was an arranged marriage which is kind of outside the norm but the soldiers were not the only ones to cause the turmoil of the past four months the finger of blame could be pointed at many Lakota as well in fact they were mostly to blame the white agents and the army officers found the flames of jealousy and let little minds that could not think beyond the moment and little men who yearned for recognition and power do the rest there was no other way to look at it in the end the Lakota defeated themselves they had the whites outnumbered an outman and did nothing the entire garrison could have been overrun by the by enough determined Lakota fighting men with a good plan if they truly wanted to return to living the old way and control of their lands and their lives instead men stepped over each other to betray their own relatives in order to obtain the power handed out by the whites a power they couldn't get on their own and he details some of this just ego drama that's going on and they have the opportunity you know if I'm if I'm in camp and you know Jason crazy horse Jason's out there still being a wild Lakota and I want more power in the camp maybe I say you know you don't want to you don't want to deal with that Jason crazy or he's too crazy out there you don't want to put him in a power position you don't want to get like all these things this happens a buffalo hunt had been promised but there'd been no hunt and crazy horse understood why first someone with more power than three stars had to say that the Lakota could go chasing buffalo if given the opportunity three stars reason the hunters would keep going perhaps all the way to grand mother's land to join sitting both which is Canada by the way adding to that some among the Lakota complain to three stars that if crazy horse and his young man were allowed to hump buffalo then everyone must be allowed and it was a Lakota who warned that it was dangerous to put guns in the hands of crazy horse but it hadn't been a wind someone had attacked the encampment the horses had been telling him something looking north as they had he walked over to a hobbled mayor she appeared on harm so he fashioned a jaw rope untied the hobbles swung onto her back and urged her into a lope toward the north where there had been movement earlier if the people in the camp were running away they would be moving as fast as possible in a bear patch of ground he saw the grooves left by a pair of drag poles pausing to look he saw other signs of drag poles then he saw something else even in the fading light the distinctive prints of the metal shoes worn by long knife horses unless soldiers had taken a pulling dragging poles something wasn't right throwing caution aside light hair galloped in the direction of the signs and at the second or third hill he saw them people were walking and leading a few horses pulling loaded drag poles though it was difficult to count how many they were but on either side was a column of mounted soldiers they were heading northwest most of the men from little funders camp had been away hunting some of them were bound to return sooner or later but for the time being light hair was alone he returned for his own horse so he could take too long to follow his relatives who are captives of the long knives back at the burned out camp he retrieved his gilding and gathered stones from several cooking fires and built a marker pointing it to the northwest and he wouldn't know to go in that direction especially given the condition of the camp he had only been in the south end of the camp so he led his horse through it to the north end the mayor snorted in apprehension and shied away from a long dark object on the ground light hair bent to it and felt the leg it was a woman she was dead he discerned other shapes in the growing darkness and went to them they were all dead he wretched after he bent low over a woman and realized that both her breasts had been cut off searching in the growing darkness he found one dead body after another all of them scalloped or mutilated in some fashion he wretched again and sat for some time before he pulled a row back from the next body a child this time perhaps ten gathering his horses he walked out of the camp he had covered everybody he found covering the shame of the insults they had suffered after the pain of death with the shock and the grief came another feeling starting like a small cloud growing over the horizon anger so that's gonna leave a mark you get to a point where there's a trajectory where it's almost impossible to stop the direction that things are going and when stuff happens like that what are you gonna do I mean you you you you through this book you you have a problem because there's this clash of cultures and the Lakota have a culture that that they're involved with raiding they're going up and raiding the crow they're they're raiding the uh um the snakes the snakes and the crow are raiding them back and it's just what they kind of do
