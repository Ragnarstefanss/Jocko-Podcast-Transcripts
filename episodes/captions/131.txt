[00:00:00] This is Jocco podcast number 131.
[00:00:04] With echo Charles and me, Jocco Winning.
[00:00:07] Good evening, I come.
[00:00:08] Good evening.
[00:00:09] It is time for some Q&A.
[00:00:10] Yes.
[00:00:11] To be banter around for a while, she just gets started.
[00:00:15] Question number one.
[00:00:17] I've been somewhat of a pushover for the majority of my life.
[00:00:22] Since listening to the podcast, I've been trying to assert myself more.
[00:00:25] One thing I can't seem to shake is constantly being interrupted.
[00:00:29] How can I rise above and overcome this obstacle?
[00:00:33] Should I read the hashtag?
[00:00:36] The hashtag fellow hardcore.
[00:00:38] Okay.
[00:00:39] There you go.
[00:00:40] There's a little layer in there because you put rise above and there.
[00:00:44] So I thought about this because I would say I don't get interrupted a lot.
[00:00:54] But I think that's kind of the current state of me.
[00:00:59] I think there's a reason why I don't get interrupted a lot.
[00:01:01] And it's not because people are going to think, well, that's because you're going to
[00:01:05] bash people in the head with a club.
[00:01:09] That's not the actual answer of why I'm looking interrupted.
[00:01:12] So one thing I think is important is, you've heard me say this before, the less people
[00:01:17] talk, the more people listen.
[00:01:19] So when I'm in a group of people that all want to talk and I want to talk over each
[00:01:24] other and they want to cut each other off, you get in that group right there.
[00:01:28] I don't talk.
[00:01:30] I don't talk.
[00:01:31] I let there's, I sit there, I listen to them and I plot.
[00:01:36] Then I think and I put together my thoughts correctly so that when I do decide to say something,
[00:01:43] it's going to have impact.
[00:01:46] And then I wait for the right moment.
[00:01:48] Because if there's people going to be agreeing back and forth, I wait for a low in the
[00:01:53] fire and when that low comes, then I make my point in a very direct manner.
[00:02:02] I might even have to wait until the conversation is like all but over, wait till they're
[00:02:07] done with their little fire fight.
[00:02:10] And then I'm going to talk.
[00:02:23] Since I've been thinking about it, it's going to be articulated in a way that I can present
[00:02:26] my full point.
[00:02:29] So I think that's an effective way to do things.
[00:02:32] I think if you let people speak a bunch, you let them get it out of their system and then
[00:02:37] when you decide to talk, they don't have anything left to say.
[00:02:40] So that's a way to stop getting cut off.
[00:02:41] So this is almost like flanking, right?
[00:02:43] This is flanking the fact that when people have a bunch to say and they got all these thoughts
[00:02:48] in their head and they want to get them all out, let them get them out.
[00:02:51] Don't try and fight that battle.
[00:02:52] They've got a bunch of things they want to say.
[00:02:54] Let them say it.
[00:02:55] Also, as we know, when you listen to someone else talk, you now know what their ideas are.
[00:03:03] You know what they're thinking.
[00:03:04] There's a power and not saying anything because it allows you to think and it allows
[00:03:08] you to hear what other people think.
[00:03:10] It allows you to hear other people's own conversation.
[00:03:13] You get to hear other people's counters to what people are saying.
[00:03:17] And you're not having to expend any ammunition yourself.
[00:03:21] Someone else is doing it.
[00:03:22] You know, the third or fourth or fifth piece person, the conversation that's expending ammunition
[00:03:26] and running their mouth to try and counter some point that someone's made.
[00:03:31] Let them do that.
[00:03:32] Because by the way, then you get to see what the other counter is.
[00:03:35] So I think being assertive doesn't mean talking more.
[00:03:40] I think being assertive means talking less talking at the appropriate times, monitoring
[00:03:47] and understanding the firefight that's happening so that when other people have
[00:03:52] expended their ammunition, you can step in and you can take your shots in a simple clear
[00:03:59] concise manner.
[00:04:01] That's what I think.
[00:04:03] I think you're right.
[00:04:04] I think you built up this reputation though.
[00:04:07] That's a little added element to your specific situation.
[00:04:10] Which is where when you talk it like you're not saying fluff, you know, when you talk
[00:04:15] it's like something.
[00:04:16] Well, that's a good point.
[00:04:18] So if you don't want to get caught off and 70% of the things that you say aren't really
[00:04:27] that impactful and don't add a lot to the conversation, well, then there's a good chance
[00:04:30] that when you open your mouth to start talking, someone else doesn't think it's going
[00:04:35] to be important.
[00:04:36] So they just jump right on top of you.
[00:04:37] But if you say less and to your point, if the things that you say generally are well
[00:04:42] fought out and clear and are going to have impact, well, then we have a good chance that
[00:04:47] you're not going to be caught off.
[00:04:49] People actually want to hear what you're going to say.
[00:04:51] Yeah, don't talk just to talk ever.
[00:04:53] Yeah, I see.
[00:04:54] And that's a hard.
[00:04:55] I shouldn't say ever, but hardly ever.
[00:04:57] Yeah.
[00:04:58] Yeah, that's a hard one.
[00:05:00] Because it's not like people are interrupting you on purpose because you don't have
[00:05:05] nothing to say.
[00:05:06] You're just talking fluff.
[00:05:08] That's nice.
[00:05:09] Not a conscious on purpose thing.
[00:05:10] A lot of the time.
[00:05:11] I think anyway.
[00:05:12] Don't feel like it is.
[00:05:13] It feels like subconscious.
[00:05:16] How can someone see fit to actually follow through with interrupting somebody if they don't
[00:05:21] think?
[00:05:22] This isn't quite that important.
[00:05:24] At the very least, what I'm about to interrupt with is more important.
[00:05:28] So there's some people think that what they're about to say is really important.
[00:05:32] Yeah, here's another thing.
[00:05:33] It's like the little boy that cried wolf, right?
[00:05:35] If I talk and talk and talk and talk, I'm taking away the value of each one of those
[00:05:43] statements that I make because I'm making so many statements that not all of them can have
[00:05:46] a high level of value.
[00:05:48] So who do you pay more attention to?
[00:05:53] The person that makes 100 statements?
[00:05:56] And what are those?
[00:05:57] Okay, let's say you want to pay attention to the person that makes 100 statements.
[00:06:00] How much can you pay attention to those 100 statements?
[00:06:03] How much do you gather from those 100 statements?
[00:06:07] It's limited amount.
[00:06:09] It's 1% per statement, right?
[00:06:12] What's 1%?
[00:06:13] You have to follow the, I make some of the statements.
[00:06:15] That's just 1% per statement.
[00:06:17] If the person says one thing, how much percent do you pay attention to that?
[00:06:21] That's right.
[00:06:22] You said it all over the present.
[00:06:24] So there you go.
[00:06:26] I mean, since Jack, good luck with that fellow hardcore kid.
[00:06:29] So I guess he'd kind of have, I mean, assuming that, you know, we understand his situation,
[00:06:34] it's hard, overall.
[00:06:37] It's kind of like you have to build a reputation of saying only important things.
[00:06:41] That's a good way to, please, to start just be quiet.
[00:06:44] There.
[00:06:45] And not only like exactly exactly what you said, that added thing which you kind of actually
[00:06:48] may have already said.
[00:06:50] But when you sit back and just listen to him, it'll cause you to have to say less because
[00:06:54] what if you wanted to like, oh, I was going to make this point.
[00:06:57] That's the feeling you get when you want to interrupt someone's like, oh, I want to make
[00:07:00] this point right now.
[00:07:01] Kind of thing, you will find out you just let people talk, you don't have to make that
[00:07:04] point.
[00:07:05] They know this stuff.
[00:07:06] You know, all of it.
[00:07:07] And you'll find, that's probably a lot of the time.
[00:07:09] You know, and by the way, if I step into make a point that people already know, how
[00:07:16] impactful is that point, it's a very limited impact.
[00:07:21] So the more points that you can hear that you know and that everyone knows and that you don't
[00:07:25] have to say the better off you are.
[00:07:27] So when you do make a point and it's a point that no one really thought of how impactful
[00:07:31] is that point.
[00:07:32] The answer is it's very impactful.
[00:07:34] Yeah, and it comes way more clear that it might be a point than no one thought of after
[00:07:38] you listen to everyone talk for how long.
[00:07:41] Then if I go away this one that covered.
[00:07:42] So I can say that you have to say all these other things that I was done.
[00:07:45] Not about making an interrupt with or whatever.
[00:07:47] Yeah, just be quiet, right?
[00:07:48] Just be quiet.
[00:07:49] And in social situations, for example, to me and this is what I kind of started doing or
[00:07:57] try to start doing in social situations, you know how like a, okay, I listen to my wife
[00:08:01] and her friends talk and there is just a boom, boom, interrupting in a, it's not rude or
[00:08:05] nothing.
[00:08:06] It's just because they're just talking and yeah, that's how they roll.
[00:08:08] Yes, how they roll.
[00:08:09] And to the point where I'm getting like little mild micro doses of anxiety because of all
[00:08:15] the interruptions.
[00:08:16] Yeah, it's like a lot.
[00:08:17] They just talk a lot.
[00:08:18] That's what it is.
[00:08:19] Anyway, so I found in social situations, if I feel that, like if I'm like trying to talk
[00:08:25] or that I'm getting interrupted a lot a lot, man, in a way, they don't really care that
[00:08:29] much about what you have to say.
[00:08:31] They have more like they care more about what they have to say.
[00:08:36] And it's a social situation.
[00:08:37] So yeah, you might as well just be quiet.
[00:08:39] You're adding less value interrupting their valuable stuff, you know, so you're be quiet.
[00:08:46] And you'll find that they'll want to talk to you more too if you be quiet and not interrupt
[00:08:49] them.
[00:08:50] You might have to take some heavy on the interruptions front though, because that is kind
[00:08:54] of knowing if you pay attention to it.
[00:08:56] That's what I think.
[00:08:57] That's you.
[00:08:58] I see what you're doing, Anna.
[00:09:00] Next question.
[00:09:02] I saw your TED talk.
[00:09:04] I like most people have a boss.
[00:09:06] If it wasn't the fault of the guys below you and there are people above you, shouldn't
[00:09:11] they take ownership.
[00:09:13] IE, your commanding officer, and then it in turn his why would ownership only drift
[00:09:19] halfway up.
[00:09:22] So in an ideal world, ownership goes up and down the chain of command.
[00:09:27] Absolutely.
[00:09:28] And that is how problems get solved because people take ownership of those problems throughout
[00:09:33] the chain of command.
[00:09:35] Now does the world always work like that?
[00:09:40] No, it doesn't.
[00:09:41] That's okay.
[00:09:42] That's fine because as the boss of what year the boss of you can't make any excuses,
[00:09:47] that's the way it happens.
[00:09:49] And when an organization is taking ownership, when you've got a team where everyone is taking
[00:09:54] ownership on that team, there's absolutely overlap of everyone taking responsibility for
[00:10:01] the different problems.
[00:10:02] There will be some overlap.
[00:10:03] I could have done this to help out.
[00:10:04] Oh, yeah, I would have done this better now.
[00:10:07] We both solved the same problem.
[00:10:08] But it's redundant but good because now we got two people addressing the problem.
[00:10:15] So that's not a bad thing.
[00:10:16] So when people are taking ownership up and down the chain of command, the problems are getting
[00:10:19] not just solved by one angle, but by multiple different angles of everyone that's taking
[00:10:24] ownership of that problem.
[00:10:27] When the blue one blue happened, that I talked about extreme ownership that was in the
[00:10:31] TED Talk.
[00:10:33] And I talk about this, my guys took ownership of what they did wrong as well, the guy that
[00:10:38] shot the Iraqi soldier, the radio and took ownership of the fact that he didn't pass the
[00:10:45] word quick enough.
[00:10:46] The element leader took ownership of the fact that the Iraqi said, got in a way from
[00:10:49] him.
[00:10:51] They all owned their little pieces.
[00:10:54] And of course, I owned it as well.
[00:10:57] And when I took ownership of everything, it wasn't like those guys then said, okay, well,
[00:11:03] then I'm absolved and I don't have to change anything.
[00:11:05] No, no, no, let's get still realized that they made some mistakes and some things that
[00:11:09] they need to clean up.
[00:11:10] So I took ownership of the same thing.
[00:11:12] They were taking ownership and guess what?
[00:11:14] Then again, it was redundant that we were all trying to solve the problems.
[00:11:18] Now, this is the opposite.
[00:11:19] This doesn't happen.
[00:11:20] When you start blaming people, everyone makes excuses.
[00:11:22] That's just the way it works.
[00:11:25] So I think that that's what you have to think about.
[00:11:29] So like I said, ideally, when a leader takes ownership, so do the people up and down the
[00:11:35] chain of command.
[00:11:37] They also take ownership of the problems that if they do, that's great.
[00:11:40] And the leader can then monitor what those people up and down the chain of command, do
[00:11:45] to fix the problem.
[00:11:47] And if they fix the problems, then that's great.
[00:11:50] That's the way it works.
[00:11:51] And if they don't fix the problems, then that's when the leader has to own it up and down
[00:11:56] the chain of command, then it still will be responsible and take ownership of fixing
[00:11:59] the problem.
[00:12:02] So the other piece of this, I guess, is that that's why extreme ownership works.
[00:12:14] It works because people that don't take ownership again up or down the chain of command,
[00:12:19] they will end up being overrun by the people that take ownership of the chain of command.
[00:12:26] Take ownership.
[00:12:28] It might not happen immediately, but eventually the people that make excuses will be overrun
[00:12:34] by the people that take ownership.
[00:12:36] That's the way it works.
[00:12:37] And by the way, and again, I talked about this in the TED talk, when that whole thing happened
[00:12:43] and I took ownership of it, my boss then trusted me more, not less.
[00:12:49] And that's what happens.
[00:12:52] You end up increasing your trust.
[00:12:55] So take ownership.
[00:13:00] If your boss takes ownership too, that's awesome.
[00:13:03] That's awesome.
[00:13:05] That means you've got multiple people trying to solve the problem, which is good for the
[00:13:09] team.
[00:13:11] You guys get asked this a lot.
[00:13:13] For some reason, life gets asked this a lot.
[00:13:16] Where it's a lot, like almost every single time I see life in a question answering situation.
[00:13:23] They say, what do I do or what happens when my boss isn't taking ownership?
[00:13:28] Or what do I do when my whatever isn't taking ownership?
[00:13:31] The question is ultimately, what do I do when the other guy isn't taking ownership?
[00:13:36] See how you're smiling right now because we all get asked so obviously, essentially, that's
[00:13:41] what this is.
[00:13:42] He's not in the scenario, so it's not.
[00:13:45] And how you guys always say, it's like, the thing is, extreme ownership isn't about
[00:13:50] the other guy taking ownership or not taking ownership.
[00:13:52] That's about everything you can personally do to take ownership.
[00:13:56] That's it.
[00:13:57] It stops right there.
[00:13:59] No, just like what you said.
[00:14:00] If everyone else is taking ownership, which will happen because it's kind of this weird
[00:14:03] contagious kind of thing.
[00:14:05] And I don't want to throw it out there like, oh, if I take ownership, then everyone's
[00:14:08] automatically right.
[00:14:09] That doesn't happen because they'll be not those that don't.
[00:14:11] There's some people that are not looking to take ownership.
[00:14:13] And again, those that people that will eventually get overwhelmed.
[00:14:15] Yes.
[00:14:16] Because who do you want working for you?
[00:14:17] The guy that says, oh, this one's a my fault.
[00:14:18] No, it doesn't.
[00:14:19] If you want that guy working for you because that person not going to change, and I'm
[00:14:22] going to do anything different, they're not going to get that problem solved.
[00:14:25] You want the person working for you that says, you know what, this is my fault.
[00:14:28] This is what I'm going to do to fix it.
[00:14:29] Here we go.
[00:14:30] You go, okay.
[00:14:31] Well, let's you continue to do your job.
[00:14:32] And I want you to continue to do your job.
[00:14:34] And by the way, when a promotion opportunity comes up, guess who I'm promoting?
[00:14:37] The guy that makes a bunch of excuses and blames other people, the guy that takes ownership
[00:14:40] and gets problems solved.
[00:14:41] There you go.
[00:14:42] It's a no-brainer.
[00:14:43] And I think as people see that in an organization, the majority of people.
[00:14:48] Now this I will say, the majority of people, they will also take ownership.
[00:14:53] There will be a minority of people that go, oh, I'm going to slough off and I'm going to
[00:14:56] keep blaming other people.
[00:14:57] And in their minds, they think they look good, right?
[00:15:00] In my mind, when I go, when it was my fault, it was echo's fault.
[00:15:02] I think I saved myself for the blame.
[00:15:05] What I really did was look like an excuse making little baby.
[00:15:07] And I don't want to promote me.
[00:15:10] Because I know it wasn't my fault.
[00:15:11] Oh, the podcast income was my fault.
[00:15:13] Is echo's fault.
[00:15:14] Oh, really?
[00:15:15] Okay.
[00:15:16] Well, let's think about that.
[00:15:17] Do you want, who's a loser?
[00:15:18] Who's responsible?
[00:15:19] I'm shirking their responsibility and fling it on some other person.
[00:15:22] I don't want that person working for me.
[00:15:24] No.
[00:15:26] So that's why it works.
[00:15:28] Yeah.
[00:15:29] And I'm scared of it.
[00:15:30] People are scared that, well, if I take the blame, I'm going to look bad.
[00:15:35] You look bad when you don't take the blame.
[00:15:36] That's when you look bad.
[00:15:38] Yeah, pretty much any time, in one wearing another, pretty much any time you look at other
[00:15:42] people and be like, hey, what about them?
[00:15:45] You know, in this extreme ownership situation.
[00:15:47] Like, it goes against the very nature of extreme ownership to ask, like, hey, what about
[00:15:52] them?
[00:15:53] Why didn't they take responsibility?
[00:15:54] Just like, I mean, back to the questions, kind of like, just to kind of get a handle
[00:15:57] on understanding what extreme ownership is.
[00:16:00] If you start to incorporate, hey, what about them?
[00:16:03] Hey, what about the higher-ups?
[00:16:04] Why should the ownership stop at you?
[00:16:06] Well, here's the thing.
[00:16:07] It doesn't begin.
[00:16:08] It begins and stops at me.
[00:16:11] That's 100% of what it is.
[00:16:13] Now, other people, I mean, if I can step out of my own situation of extreme ownership
[00:16:17] and just kind of evaluate other people when they see you or feel you or see you taking ownership
[00:16:22] of stuff, I think it tends to be contagious.
[00:16:25] Like, this is, no, absolutely.
[00:16:26] That's what I just said, the majority of people with you take ownership.
[00:16:30] When I take ownership of something, if I go echo, you know, this is my fault that the
[00:16:33] podcast didn't come out.
[00:16:34] Whatever.
[00:16:35] This is my fault that we didn't get this done.
[00:16:36] Your tendency isn't to go, oh, cool.
[00:16:39] It's Joc was fault.
[00:16:40] Yeah, I agree with you.
[00:16:41] You go, no, man, I should have done this or I should have done that.
[00:16:43] And now, once again, we're both trying to solve the problem.
[00:16:47] That's the way I usually end up.
[00:16:48] Yeah.
[00:16:49] Really interesting, how like Jamie, you know, you know, you're with Jamie, you're Jamie.
[00:16:54] That's fun.
[00:16:55] And she'll, like, all make some mistake, you know, on the spelling of something, on
[00:17:00] some video, I don't know something.
[00:17:01] And she'll, she's real good at taking ownership.
[00:17:04] She's like, oh, you know, I should have, you know, whatever, whatever.
[00:17:06] And to the point, something, I was like, I see what you're doing.
[00:17:09] And it's true.
[00:17:10] Like any feeling of like, oh, oh, I should, you know, excuse me, you know, whatever.
[00:17:15] Any feeling of that gone.
[00:17:17] When someone is like, I don't know, it's my fault.
[00:17:18] I should have caught that.
[00:17:19] Or what do you, you should have caught that.
[00:17:21] I should have caught that.
[00:17:22] I made the video kind of thing kind of thing.
[00:17:24] But man, it works.
[00:17:25] So like, it's real contagious.
[00:17:26] I think even people who are just naturally defensive, you know, you know, because people
[00:17:30] are different, you know, I think over time they tend to be, when they kind of build this,
[00:17:36] kind of, when everyone builds a reputation of not blaming, it's like they
[00:17:40] they, they let that natural guard down in these tent, look over time, you know, even if
[00:17:45] they at first, they don't want to.
[00:17:47] Jack.
[00:17:48] Next question.
[00:17:50] What are some ways to get out of a rut in jujitsu?
[00:17:54] We're just talking about this.
[00:17:57] It's all fair.
[00:17:58] I always get caught in the same spot, cross side and can't move.
[00:18:03] What should I do?
[00:18:06] This is a brutal answer.
[00:18:08] With the truth, if you have a hard time in a certain position, start there every time,
[00:18:14] start with a person across the side until you get used to it.
[00:18:19] And then on top of starting there and you start working your techniques, learn some new
[00:18:24] escapes, because whatever you're doing right now isn't working.
[00:18:27] So learn some new excuse, escapes.
[00:18:29] Now this doesn't mean that you need to learn 47 escapes.
[00:18:33] But if you've got your one go to escape and it's not working, there's actually there's
[00:18:37] a pretty good chance if you only know one escape from something that's not going to work.
[00:18:40] Because one escape, then the guests with the person has to defend, one thing.
[00:18:43] And so they stop it.
[00:18:45] So learn, you know, three escapes total, maybe four escapes total.
[00:18:52] And these are escapes that must be escapes that kind of chain together, which most of the
[00:18:56] time they do.
[00:18:58] So you learn, you know, you can ask, obviously, you can ask your instructor.
[00:19:02] You can ask some of the other students that you see get out.
[00:19:05] How did you do that?
[00:19:06] You can even go look at YouTube and Google cross side escapes and get some good ideas
[00:19:10] from there.
[00:19:12] And then you're going to have to take risks while you try your newest escapes in, you
[00:19:16] can drill them, of course.
[00:19:17] But then eventually you're going to have to try and live because when you do something
[00:19:21] in a drill, it is not the same as doing it live.
[00:19:24] It's, there are adjustments that need to be made and things that you need to figure out.
[00:19:28] And you're not going to be successful.
[00:19:30] The first hundred times or fifty times or twenty eight times or four hundred and twenty
[00:19:36] times that you try something.
[00:19:38] There's a lot of little things you got to figure out and you're going to get caught in
[00:19:41] some of those times.
[00:19:42] You're going to try something you're going to get caught.
[00:19:44] So take risks and try your escapes.
[00:19:51] Another point, and I've probably talked about this before specifically, cross side.
[00:19:58] Don't wait until the person settles in before you start your escape.
[00:20:03] And this is true with anything, right?
[00:20:04] This is true with life.
[00:20:05] Don't wait until you're, if you see a bad position coming, don't wait until the position.
[00:20:10] Don't wait until the bad thing actually fully happens to you.
[00:20:13] No, start to defend it before it settles in on you.
[00:20:16] Get a bad scenario coming down the line.
[00:20:18] Start to aggressively counter that bad thing.
[00:20:21] Whatever it is before it actually gets you.
[00:20:28] And if you can do that, then you will be, I guarantee that's a lot of the problem right
[00:20:35] there.
[00:20:36] Because, you know what?
[00:20:38] Because getting out of a cross side is a really hard position.
[00:20:40] You get out of, I don't care who you are.
[00:20:41] I've a hard time.
[00:20:42] When Dean gets a cross side on me, it is hard to get out.
[00:20:45] Like I mean, it's really hard to get out.
[00:20:49] So what does that mean?
[00:20:50] Yeah, that's a dominant position.
[00:20:53] And that's the last thing is like you have to take some risks to get out.
[00:20:58] Sometimes you got to break the rules to get out.
[00:21:00] You got to do something.
[00:21:01] You got to offer up a possible submission to them that you know is coming.
[00:21:06] There's some things that you can do like that.
[00:21:09] But escaping before the situation has occurred to you is a very positive thing.
[00:21:17] You could do that with anything.
[00:21:18] You're in a relationship, you see something bad coming down the easy, a human being, you're
[00:21:23] in a relationship with, and you see that the relationship is going in a bad direction.
[00:21:27] If you try and either fix it or end it before the thing goes sideways, that's the smart thing
[00:21:36] to do.
[00:21:37] Don't wait until everything's a disaster.
[00:21:40] You've got to go and get the restraining order.
[00:21:43] Whatever.
[00:21:44] You're calling the cops because you've got someone that's acting irrational.
[00:21:49] Don't wait until that moment.
[00:21:52] Solve the problem as early as possible.
[00:21:54] Is the point.
[00:21:55] Yeah.
[00:21:56] So that's how you get out of that little rut.
[00:21:58] Yeah, that's what you said in the beginning of the start in that bad situation.
[00:22:03] That's a huge hug.
[00:22:05] And I don't know if all the academy's do this, but I mean, Dean has always done this
[00:22:08] where before you do open matter, the life rolling, whatever.
[00:22:11] Right before that, there's a part where it's essentially situational training.
[00:22:16] You know, you start side control.
[00:22:17] We're going to go for two minutes or minute half whatever, one night top one and bottom
[00:22:21] obviously.
[00:22:22] And if you get out restarted.
[00:22:23] Exactly right.
[00:22:24] Yeah, you know, the top guys trying to submit the bottom guy, the bottom guy is trying
[00:22:26] to escape.
[00:22:27] If the bottom guy escapes, you start over.
[00:22:29] Yeah.
[00:22:30] That's it.
[00:22:31] And the other point to that is if you get submitted doesn't count.
[00:22:33] Exactly right.
[00:22:34] Like it's like, yeah, of course.
[00:22:35] I'm trying new things.
[00:22:36] I'm taking rest.
[00:22:37] So I expect you.
[00:22:38] I actually expect that you're going to get submitted because you're
[00:22:41] trying new things.
[00:22:42] If you, in fact, if you don't get submitted, you fail because you didn't try
[00:22:46] something new that was really, yeah, you're just staying there.
[00:22:48] Yeah, that's not what that drills for.
[00:22:51] And you can feel it, too.
[00:22:52] You know, like, okay, sure the guy tapped me, yeah, you don't want him to
[00:22:54] tap you up, but you're there at escape.
[00:22:56] That's it.
[00:22:57] You know, so it's not about like winning this match or losing this round or whatever,
[00:23:01] you know, you're, and then you get so familiar with being inside control.
[00:23:05] So when you do go live, you're like, oh, I'm familiar because I've done this situation
[00:23:08] for drill.
[00:23:09] Full speed, by the way, it's a full speed drill.
[00:23:11] And yeah, you're just so familiar with that position.
[00:23:13] So not only more comfortable, you know those different escapes that you've learned,
[00:23:17] you don't really have that day or whatever, whenever you learn them.
[00:23:20] And then you can execute way better.
[00:23:22] You can comfortable being uncomfortable.
[00:23:24] Yeah, but that help, and that helps so much those, those situational sparring drills.
[00:23:32] Next question.
[00:23:33] Juggle.
[00:23:34] There are no bad teams, only bad leaders.
[00:23:38] Do you think there are exceptions to this?
[00:23:41] If so, how do you know your part of the exception?
[00:23:47] That is a quote from the book Extreme Ownership written by myself on my brother,
[00:23:51] Lave Babin and it is a quote that I don't want to say we stole, but we stole.
[00:23:58] We appropriated from David Hackworth, who said, there's no bad, I think he said no bad
[00:24:05] officers, no bad units, only bad officers, and Napoleon, who said there's no bad regiments,
[00:24:11] only bad kernels.
[00:24:12] And we said there's no bad teams, only bad leaders.
[00:24:16] And the question is, is there an exception to this?
[00:24:19] And how do you know if you're part of the exception?
[00:24:21] Well, actually there is, there's a big exception to this.
[00:24:25] And the exception is that there are bad leaders with good teams.
[00:24:30] That is true.
[00:24:31] That can happen.
[00:24:32] Sometimes you get a bad leader that is running a really, really good team.
[00:24:37] So that's an exception.
[00:24:38] I guess it's an exception this world.
[00:24:39] Maybe that's the way I took it.
[00:24:42] So you get a team that's so good that they just continue to perform even though they have
[00:24:47] a horrible leader.
[00:24:48] They perform despite their bad leader.
[00:24:52] Gotcha.
[00:24:53] Now, what this doesn't, this does not prove, you know, I always say leadership is the most
[00:24:59] important thing on the battlefield.
[00:25:01] This doesn't disprove that statement.
[00:25:05] You'd think maybe it does because, oh, you got a bad leader and you got a good team, then
[00:25:08] maybe leadership isn't that important.
[00:25:10] That's wrong.
[00:25:11] Actually, what it proves is that leadership can come from any level inside the organization.
[00:25:17] That's what it proves.
[00:25:18] And it proves that because I've seen that over and over again when I was running the training
[00:25:20] from the sea of pollutants, eventually I didn't care where the leadership in the
[00:25:27] Platoon was because I realized that it was a real, it was a real, hard thing to hope for
[00:25:35] that you had the person that was in the leadership positions, like the Platoon commander or
[00:25:42] the Platoon chief to assume or to figure that they were going to be the leader that you
[00:25:49] wanted them to be was a big assumption to make.
[00:25:52] And so what I realized after training for a while is that even though I wanted the leaders
[00:25:55] to be those senior guys who were supposed to be taking leadership, eventually I realized
[00:26:00] as I didn't care where that leadership came from.
[00:26:03] As long as there were a couple of good leaders, you'd end up with a good C-Oplatoon and
[00:26:07] the Platoon would be on track.
[00:26:10] Now maybe the question is what this person is hinting at.
[00:26:15] The exception being is there an exception that if there is a bad team, maybe that team
[00:26:20] is just so filled with bad people that they can't get the job done.
[00:26:24] That's the kind of exception he's talking about.
[00:26:25] Or failing because the team is so bad, even though the leader is good, even though the
[00:26:30] leader is good, but the team is so bad that that's an exception to the rule.
[00:26:35] Well guess what?
[00:26:39] Who's responsible for the people on the team?
[00:26:42] Who's responsible for training the people on the team so that they can get good at their
[00:26:45] job and they can perform with excellence or who's in charge of getting rid of the people
[00:26:52] that are so far so that the team steps up their performance.
[00:26:55] Well, the answer to all those questions is the leader.
[00:26:59] So if you're on a bad team and you're leading the team, it's your fault.
[00:27:04] And there's no exception to that.
[00:27:06] Zero.
[00:27:07] Yeah, I'm over here trying to think of the exception, but just what you said is like,
[00:27:11] yeah, it kind of negates any.
[00:27:13] Hey, let's take a real, real simple example of like a sports team, right?
[00:27:19] Oh, this sports team got dealt a bad hand and now the people on the team, well, what
[00:27:24] are you going to do?
[00:27:26] You're going to train those people.
[00:27:27] Who's responsible?
[00:27:28] I'm not saying you're going to perform right now, but you can get on the trajectory
[00:27:31] will you be good eventually?
[00:27:34] Now if you just blame, hey, I got a bad team.
[00:27:35] Well, guess what?
[00:27:36] Then you don't put an effort.
[00:27:37] Guess what?
[00:27:38] You're going to continue to be a loser.
[00:27:39] The exception.
[00:27:40] Yeah, my team and my team is just so bad.
[00:27:44] Train your people.
[00:27:45] I'm not saying you're a miracle worker.
[00:27:47] Yeah.
[00:27:48] I'm not saying you can, you can take people that don't have any skills and instantly
[00:27:53] through your leadership term them into incredible performers.
[00:27:57] No, that's not going to happen, but guess what?
[00:28:00] As a leader, you've got to bring people into your team that are good.
[00:28:02] You do train the people that you do have up to the best of their abilities and the people
[00:28:06] that can't perform the way they need to perform.
[00:28:08] You get rid of them.
[00:28:09] Yeah.
[00:28:10] That's it.
[00:28:12] No real exceptions.
[00:28:15] Other than, yeah, you can have a good team with bad leaders.
[00:28:18] Yeah, I only guess it's a good leader somewhere in there.
[00:28:21] The exceptions thing, I think it's healthy in my opinion.
[00:28:25] No, it's good for this and most of the things where if I or we start thinking that
[00:28:31] we're the exception, so we don't have to put in like, I don't know, like the work or
[00:28:36] whatever, not necessarily work, but the, you know, like, okay, we'll take this.
[00:28:40] No bad teams, don't leave bad leaders.
[00:28:42] But, you know, if I say, I might be the exception to this because my team is so bad.
[00:28:46] It's kind of like, you're going to do a little cop out there.
[00:28:49] Kind of thing.
[00:28:50] 100% of it.
[00:28:51] If you don't take ownership of what's going on, then you're not going to perform well.
[00:28:56] If you just blame your genetics, then that means, okay, well, I'm not going to get any kind
[00:29:01] of shape whatsoever.
[00:29:02] Then guess what, guess what, kind of shape your being.
[00:29:05] Junk.
[00:29:06] Substant.
[00:29:07] Substandard.
[00:29:08] Thanks, Wes.
[00:29:09] Junk.
[00:29:10] Leadership is knowing when to cut someone loose, that can't
[00:29:16] perform in a team.
[00:29:18] But, do you have any techniques for trying to help people who lack common sense get better
[00:29:24] in the name of just trying to make the world a better place?
[00:29:27] Obviously without being a jerk.
[00:29:30] My, my common answer in situations like this and you've heard it before is to pick, put them
[00:29:35] in charge or something, right?
[00:29:36] You got someone that's, that doesn't have a lot of common sense.
[00:29:40] Pick something that's maybe just outside their level of competency and put them in charge
[00:29:44] of it.
[00:29:45] So, something that doesn't put too much at risk.
[00:29:50] So, you can give them some room to make some decisions.
[00:29:52] And some mistakes without doing too much damage.
[00:29:55] And then you coach them, you monitor them and you coach them.
[00:30:03] And you coach them not just on what decision to make, but more important how to make that
[00:30:12] decision.
[00:30:13] If you think about what common sense is, if you break it down, if you break down what
[00:30:18] common sense is, common sense is like a blanket term that we don't really relate it to
[00:30:22] what it really means.
[00:30:24] But it's a blanket term that covers a person's sort of natural ability to make good decisions.
[00:30:32] That's what common sense essentially is, right?
[00:30:35] Because you don't look at someone, someone makes a bad decision.
[00:30:38] And you say that person has no common sense.
[00:30:40] Someone makes a good decision or continually makes good decisions.
[00:30:42] You go, the person's got a lot of common sense.
[00:30:45] So what we're really talking about is there ability to make decisions.
[00:30:51] So when you're trying to help someone increase their common sense, what you're really trying
[00:30:56] to do is improve their decision making process.
[00:30:59] So some things to look at when it comes to improving your decision making process, number
[00:31:04] one learn how to step back and detach.
[00:31:07] That's number one.
[00:31:09] You can't make good decisions when you're all embroiled in the gunfight.
[00:31:15] Learn how to analyze and assess and create different courses of action.
[00:31:23] Some people only see you one way.
[00:31:25] And when you only see one way and you can't detach, you never open up your mind to see
[00:31:29] that there could possibly be other ways.
[00:31:33] You have to, in order to have good common sense, slash, make good decisions.
[00:31:38] You have to understand how to look at and understand what the consequences of your actions
[00:31:48] are going to be.
[00:31:50] And that includes second and third order effects.
[00:31:52] Because a lot of times when people, you know, that guy has no common sense because they
[00:31:55] do something that to them makes sense at that moment.
[00:31:57] They don't understand what the consequences are.
[00:31:58] They don't understand the second or third order effects.
[00:32:01] And so it ends up being a bad decision.
[00:32:02] And we just throw up like, oh, the guy got no common sense.
[00:32:07] To make a good decision, you have to know how to mitigate risk.
[00:32:11] That's also very important to make a good decision.
[00:32:13] You have to understand what your assets are and what kind of resources you have.
[00:32:18] Even on a simple decision.
[00:32:21] Even on a quote common sense decision, you have to understand what you have at hand to help
[00:32:27] you execute whatever decision you make.
[00:32:30] You have to, this is a big one.
[00:32:31] You have to learn if you want to make good decisions.
[00:32:35] You have to understand that you're going to make some assumptions.
[00:32:40] And you have to analyze those assumptions and see which ones make sense to make and which
[00:32:45] ones are not sensible to make.
[00:32:48] Because obviously, and there's that old, there's that old saying about assumptions don't
[00:32:53] assume because it makes an ass out of you and me.
[00:32:55] That's a pretty realistic saying.
[00:32:58] It's a pretty good saying to keep in the back of your mind.
[00:33:00] If you make assumptions on things, however, that being said, if you make no assumptions
[00:33:06] well, then you can never move forward on most things because you've got to assume like,
[00:33:09] okay, most of the time this is probably what's going to happen and you can go forward
[00:33:12] with that.
[00:33:13] So the list goes on and on and what you need to do is as you give these people a little
[00:33:23] bit of room and a little bit of responsibility and a little bit of decision making in
[00:33:29] their life.
[00:33:30] With your kids, right?
[00:33:31] You give your kids the opportunity to make a decision.
[00:33:34] And if they make a bad decision and all you do is smack them without explaining to them
[00:33:41] the process, the decision making process, which is where that decision came from, then
[00:33:47] they're never going to gain more common sense.
[00:33:50] And you know, when you think about the list, I think detachment is actually the most
[00:33:54] important thing.
[00:33:56] And I think what happens, the people that don't have common sense, they actually don't
[00:34:02] have the ability at that time because they haven't been trained properly to see things
[00:34:07] from an outside perspective.
[00:34:09] Yeah.
[00:34:10] Have you ever noticed when somebody does something that's completely lack of common sense,
[00:34:15] when you raise the point to them, they're always kind of like a staunched that they don't
[00:34:21] even get why what they did was dumb.
[00:34:26] They just think that that's just how it was going to be.
[00:34:30] And they don't even understand that what they did was dumb.
[00:34:32] And sometimes you have to actually explain to people that they're so embedded in their
[00:34:37] decision-making process, they can't see it from an external perspective.
[00:34:40] So they don't even understand how dumb their decision was.
[00:34:44] If you can get them some level of detachment, then you're moving them in the right direction.
[00:34:50] You're improving their common sense.
[00:34:52] And yes, when you're doing that to your credit, you're actually making the world a better
[00:34:57] place.
[00:34:59] Yeah.
[00:35:00] And they get, and you kind of said this anyway, but you give them experience, like when
[00:35:04] you let them make for your decision to get, because really that's really what common
[00:35:08] sense is, right, if you have or don't have common sense, it's like, if you have a lot of
[00:35:12] experience, common sense is like, you're a little bit more in touch with it than someone
[00:35:16] with very little experience.
[00:35:17] So let's say, I mean, it's culturally, we'll say.
[00:35:20] So in Hawaii, everyone takes out their shoes when they go in the house.
[00:35:22] This is just how.
[00:35:24] And in the mainland, it's not like that.
[00:35:26] So if I've never been a Hawaii, I've no experience in Hawaii, but in the, I live in the
[00:35:31] mainland the whole time.
[00:35:32] But I don't have any access to the whole Hawaii culture, whatever.
[00:35:35] I've got a Hawaii.
[00:35:36] I'm going to leave my shoes on.
[00:35:38] It's like common sense, man.
[00:35:40] You take off your shoes if you've only lived in Hawaii the whole time, right?
[00:35:44] No.
[00:35:45] It's you could argue, hey, all you got to do is look around and see, but I don't, I'm
[00:35:51] not trained to look around to see what everyone's wearing and not wearing.
[00:35:54] You know, like, well, I'm weird.
[00:35:56] You ever notice, I would say once a month at the gym, someone walks on the mat with
[00:36:01] shoes on, like, just not even when it's, they're really stepping over a big pile or
[00:36:08] line of shoes of flip flops, it's just to get on the mat.
[00:36:12] And there's no factor.
[00:36:13] They're stepping over with their street shoes on.
[00:36:15] Yeah, exactly.
[00:36:16] That's the exact, the exact, the exact, the common sense would tell you, hey, it looks
[00:36:21] like every single person.
[00:36:22] There's 28 people on the mat, none of them are wearing shoes and I'm stepping over.
[00:36:26] You think, but that's a person that does an F common sense.
[00:36:28] Right.
[00:36:29] So what you have to do with a person like that, when you see someone that does that kind
[00:36:32] of thing, you know, let's say your kid did that.
[00:36:34] You'd say, hey, instead of just going, hey, kick off your shoes.
[00:36:37] You know, you go, hey, before you do something, look around at the environment.
[00:36:41] Take a look around.
[00:36:42] What do you see?
[00:36:43] All these people on the mat, none of them wearing shoes.
[00:36:46] And you look right in front of your feet and there's all these shoes off the mat, that
[00:36:50] probably indicates that you should take off your shoes.
[00:36:53] That should be a good decision.
[00:36:55] It should be, but now you're going to get another different type of experience.
[00:36:59] Like if you're in scenarios often where you were looking around and seeing what other
[00:37:04] people are doing and wearing, like, and all this stuff, if you're in constantly in situations
[00:37:09] like that, that will become more part of your common sense.
[00:37:12] Right.
[00:37:13] So it's like to say, I mean, there are plenty of people who in normal everyday life have
[00:37:19] normal common sense, like everyone else, who would wear shoes on the mat.
[00:37:23] They just simply would because they don't, hey, these guys are training.
[00:37:27] They're not going to wear shoes while they're training.
[00:37:29] So they took off the shoes.
[00:37:30] I'm not training.
[00:37:31] I'm just going to go talk to this guy over here.
[00:37:32] Oh, my, I'm rolling with the shoes on the mat.
[00:37:34] Just like, oh, I've never been on.
[00:37:35] You know, I'm going to go in this house.
[00:37:37] They live here.
[00:37:38] They maybe he just got out of bed, maybe they just want to be comfortable because they got out
[00:37:41] of work.
[00:37:42] Well, I don't, it doesn't go through the thought process of my common sense.
[00:37:45] My common sense is if I don't have to take off my shoes for something specific, I'm not
[00:37:50] going to do it.
[00:37:51] That's just how that's just my common experience.
[00:37:54] You know, so the common sense is kind of a situational thing.
[00:37:57] You know, it's not just couldn't drive.
[00:37:58] He has common sense versus not.
[00:38:00] So you put them in more experience that's common to the group.
[00:38:04] Oh, man, it's common sense goes up.
[00:38:07] Fair enough.
[00:38:08] I think so.
[00:38:09] I think so.
[00:38:11] Next question.
[00:38:12] I've been told by employees that I'm cold and non-engaging.
[00:38:17] My peers say I charge hell with a bucket of water and sometimes get to stop or sometimes
[00:38:23] forget to stop and feel the bucket in military training.
[00:38:26] We all went through the mental part and in battle, someone engaged properly.
[00:38:32] I treat my business the same way as I fought.
[00:38:35] In a firefight, my mind was clear, focused on the objective, and being aggressive always.
[00:38:40] Why should my business be any different?
[00:38:43] Delegate and don't quit until you accomplish the goal.
[00:38:46] Isn't this wrong?
[00:38:51] So let's start with cold and non-engaging.
[00:38:57] I get that people have different levels of emotional responsiveness.
[00:39:01] I get that.
[00:39:02] I'm probably a little bit on the low end of that in terms of being super emotionally
[00:39:08] responsive.
[00:39:11] I don't really get mad.
[00:39:14] I don't usually get frustrated.
[00:39:19] But at the same time, as a leader, you have to show some emotion.
[00:39:23] And if you show no emotion at all, then you're on a person, you're a robot.
[00:39:28] And robots don't really connect with people.
[00:39:31] And so you don't form a new relationships, and if you don't form good relationships,
[00:39:39] you're not going to have a good leadership connection with your team.
[00:39:45] That's the way it is.
[00:39:46] So you've got to show some emotions.
[00:39:49] You don't need to get all wild.
[00:39:52] And in fact, as a leader, your emotions should be controlled.
[00:39:56] If a normal person's emotions go from one to ten, a leader should be like, you know,
[00:40:03] at three, maybe four, and they shouldn't go beyond that.
[00:40:06] And I've talked about this before.
[00:40:07] If my team's getting all emotional and I'm just all cold, I actually disconnect from
[00:40:13] my team.
[00:40:14] And obviously they're looking at me like, I'm not one of them.
[00:40:16] That's a bad thing.
[00:40:17] Yeah, it doesn't even care.
[00:40:19] Same thing with your spouse.
[00:40:20] If you're spouse is all mad about something and you're like, hey, just calm down.
[00:40:25] Look at that's going to be a problem.
[00:40:27] You have to give them some emotions back.
[00:40:30] So show some emotions as a leader.
[00:40:34] You might even have to, you know, many factions are just a little bit to let them see
[00:40:41] that you care.
[00:40:42] You know, you got to do that with your kids sometimes, you know, because like, your
[00:40:45] kid is doing something that you know they shouldn't be doing, but it's kind of funny.
[00:40:49] And it's hard to get mad at.
[00:40:50] But you realize if you don't get mad and this behavior escalates, then that's
[00:40:55] problematic.
[00:40:56] Like, are you kind of fired up when your kid does something kinds up on a wall and
[00:41:00] is balancing, you know, eight feet in the air?
[00:41:02] Well, if they fall and crack their head, that's going to be a problem.
[00:41:04] At the same time, you think it's kind of cool.
[00:41:07] But you have to reinforce safety.
[00:41:11] And so you've got to be like a little bit angry at him.
[00:41:14] Right?
[00:41:15] Hey, hey, I told you not to do it.
[00:41:17] Right?
[00:41:18] Kid running in the row or whatever, you've got to reinforce stuff.
[00:41:20] So it's a, you, you actually have to show some level of emotions.
[00:41:25] Now, as far as the other part of the question is aggression and never quitting, is that
[00:41:34] wrong?
[00:41:35] Well, you know, quite frankly, yes.
[00:41:40] Yes, it can be very wrong.
[00:41:46] Of course, much of what the statement is, it makes sense.
[00:41:52] Right?
[00:41:53] Be aggressive.
[00:41:54] Don't quit.
[00:41:55] Focus on the objective.
[00:41:56] Charge into hell with vengeance.
[00:41:57] Right?
[00:41:58] We all like to hear that.
[00:41:59] Right?
[00:42:00] That reflects a great attitude.
[00:42:01] I think everyone would expect me and they would actually hear me say those things.
[00:42:06] The same exact things I want to be aggressive were never going to quit.
[00:42:08] We're going to take that objective no matter what.
[00:42:10] You would care me say that.
[00:42:15] But at the same time, we have to remember that there are dichotomies in leadership.
[00:42:19] Right?
[00:42:20] And taking what is a normally, what is normally a good attitude to an absolute extreme without
[00:42:26] any balance at all, that will turn into a problem.
[00:42:31] So it sounds like this individual is aggressive, which is a very positive trait.
[00:42:36] But it sounds like perhaps there are times when this individual might be too aggressive.
[00:42:41] Now most people don't want to hear that.
[00:42:45] Then they don't think they're going to hear that for me.
[00:42:47] You almost think when somebody asks me a question like this, you almost think in their
[00:42:51] back of their mind they're going, you know what, Jock was going to tell me and I'm going
[00:42:54] to go even harder.
[00:42:56] Right?
[00:42:57] Should be very unfortunate from Jocko about how being aggressive is awesome.
[00:43:01] But here's the reality.
[00:43:03] And especially if you throw like the firefight thing, like Jocko's definitely going to
[00:43:06] be on board with me now.
[00:43:08] But guess what?
[00:43:09] If you're in a firefight and the enemy isn't an elevated bunker to position across
[00:43:14] open ground and you just keep attacking it with your platoon, what's going to happen?
[00:43:21] I'll tell you what's going to happen.
[00:43:22] You're all going to die.
[00:43:24] That's what's going to happen.
[00:43:26] So you're all fired up.
[00:43:28] You're all aggressive.
[00:43:29] You're never going to quit and you're all going to die.
[00:43:31] Does that help us?
[00:43:32] Does that help us achieve our overall strategic objective?
[00:43:36] The answer is no.
[00:43:38] If you pull back for a minute, if you detach from a moment mentally and possibly physically
[00:43:44] as well, you will likely see that there's a better approach.
[00:43:48] Oh, how about we call for fire support?
[00:43:52] How would we put down some cover, lay down some suppressive iron, move around to the flank
[00:43:56] of the bunker position?
[00:43:57] There's a bunch of different ways that you can get this done in a much more survivable way.
[00:44:06] The fact is, if you're always aggressive and your mindset is I'm not going to quit, then
[00:44:13] you won't see those other solutions.
[00:44:14] And yes, that is problematic.
[00:44:16] Yes, that is wrong.
[00:44:17] And it's the same thing in dealing with people.
[00:44:21] If people don't respond to your leadership and your reaction that is just to get more and
[00:44:29] more aggressive with them, they aren't likely to come around.
[00:44:33] In fact, they're likely to either become hostile towards you because you're being aggressive
[00:44:38] towards them or they break, which each one of those is problematic bad results.
[00:44:47] Either my team becomes hostile towards me or I break my team either way, it's bad.
[00:44:52] So being aggressive all the time, no, not good.
[00:44:57] And same thing, same thing could be like, I default to aggressive, right?
[00:45:01] I literally teach people to be that way.
[00:45:04] But if you go too far with it, you'll end up in a bad situation, same thing with
[00:45:09] don't quit, right?
[00:45:10] Of course, of course don't quit, great attitude, my attitude is I'm never going to quit.
[00:45:16] I want everyone on my team to have that attitude.
[00:45:18] I have that attitude.
[00:45:20] That's like the saying in the SEAL teams don't quit, never quit.
[00:45:28] You have to be very, very careful that you don't confuse, don't quit with, don't try any
[00:45:38] other solutions or don't deviate from the original plan no matter what.
[00:45:43] Hey, I'm not quitting.
[00:45:44] I'm just going to keep doing the same thing over and over again.
[00:45:46] I'm going to keep going forward with the same plan.
[00:45:48] The plan isn't working.
[00:45:49] Okay, but I'm not a quit or I'm just going to keep doing the same plan.
[00:45:52] That's not good.
[00:45:54] That's not good.
[00:45:56] Don't quit means you don't give up.
[00:45:58] It actually don't quit actually means try different solutions if one of them isn't working.
[00:46:04] Don't quit means keep an open mind.
[00:46:08] Don't quit means you don't quit thinking.
[00:46:12] Don't quit thinking and then don't quit means you continue to keep thinking and keep addressing
[00:46:20] a problem and keep attacking the problem until you do accomplish the mission.
[00:46:23] You do that through multiple different avenues, not the same avenue the whole time.
[00:46:32] That's how you lead.
[00:46:34] That's how you get aggressive.
[00:46:35] That's how you actually never quit and by the way, that is how you win.
[00:46:42] Yeah, that morale thing.
[00:46:47] Remember, you've talked about morale.
[00:46:49] Actually, where, you know, like some,
[00:46:53] bosses that we like, hey, I'm not here to make you feel good or I'm not here to make friends
[00:46:59] or whatever.
[00:47:02] And sometimes like behavior or whatever things like that can lead to behavior that makes
[00:47:07] people not want to work for you or not feel good about the job.
[00:47:11] I'm not happy about like what's the use of making someone do the job if they don't feel
[00:47:15] good about doing it.
[00:47:16] You know, like the morale is down.
[00:47:18] And you still think the normal morale, like people need to just toughen up, you know, like
[00:47:22] freaking the reality.
[00:47:23] You don't just not do something just because you're not feeling good that day kind of
[00:47:27] kind of thing.
[00:47:28] I thought that too.
[00:47:29] But man, if you have a group of people who they all don't want to do it, they're
[00:47:33] not going to do it.
[00:47:34] It's problem.
[00:47:35] At the end of the day, they're going to not do it.
[00:47:37] Well, they might do that one thing that day.
[00:47:39] Yeah, I mean, over time, you're going to break down for sure.
[00:47:41] Yeah.
[00:47:42] You're not leading them in the right direction.
[00:47:44] Yeah.
[00:47:45] You can look forcing people to do things when you're in a position of authority.
[00:47:49] You can do that.
[00:47:51] That works.
[00:47:52] That's functional.
[00:47:53] It'll work a little bit.
[00:47:55] But over time, will you end up with a team that really will perform well and will continue
[00:47:59] to drive when they hit obstacles?
[00:48:01] No, you won't.
[00:48:02] You'll end up with a team that's doing what they're being told to do out of fear.
[00:48:08] And that team is going to get beat by the team that is doing it because they want to do it.
[00:48:14] Yeah.
[00:48:15] Yeah.
[00:48:16] So if it's like, you know, the guy who, you know, they, I don't think that my boss cares
[00:48:23] about me.
[00:48:24] In fact, I think that he kind of doesn't care about me.
[00:48:26] That's what I think.
[00:48:27] You're not going to do a lot of extra effort to support your boss.
[00:48:31] I'm sure.
[00:48:32] I don't want to.
[00:48:33] Next question, Jockel.
[00:48:34] Do you talk about building relationships a lot at work, even when people whom you might
[00:48:40] not like, even with people whom you don't like.
[00:48:44] Have you always been this way or did you also feel difficult?
[00:48:50] Also feel difficult.
[00:48:51] Difficulty in wanting to build relationships with those people.
[00:48:55] If the latter, what are the things that help you to actually want to build relationships
[00:49:00] with them?
[00:49:01] Thanks.
[00:49:02] So when I was a young seal, I was pretty typical young seal, pretty typical young man,
[00:49:13] meaning I thought I was invincible.
[00:49:16] I thought I could beat everyone in a fight because I didn't know Jockel, so you just
[00:49:20] think you're just going to win, but that you're wrong.
[00:49:23] I thought I knew everything.
[00:49:24] Of course.
[00:49:27] And I thought I was smarter than everyone else.
[00:49:29] Kind of typical.
[00:49:32] Sometimes I would rub people the wrong way.
[00:49:35] The people that I would rub the wrong way were especially people that I thought were not
[00:49:40] squared away in the chain of command.
[00:49:42] So if you were in my boss and I didn't think you were squared away, I was going to
[00:49:46] rub you the wrong way because I was going to be slightly offensive.
[00:49:51] As a matter of fact, I got an evaluation.
[00:49:53] It's one of the first evaluations that I got when I got to a seal team.
[00:49:56] And back in the day, yeah, you'd get your rated 4.0 as the highest you could get and
[00:50:03] it would go all the way down to whatever, like one.
[00:50:06] But at this time, basically everyone got 4L and everything.
[00:50:10] And you'd have to mess up.
[00:50:13] You'd have to mess up.
[00:50:14] You'd have to mess up.
[00:50:15] So I got all 4Ls and I got a 3.8, which was like a major dig.
[00:50:25] And the dig was in relation.
[00:50:29] I don't know what the word was, but when I got debriefed on it, what the guy that gave
[00:50:34] me the 3.8, what he told me, which I actually was proud of.
[00:50:40] Because that's how stupid I was.
[00:50:42] He's like, you're, you're too hostile with people that aren't squared away.
[00:50:47] That's literally what he told me.
[00:50:49] And I was all like, whatever, you're damn right.
[00:50:52] I'm hostile towards people that aren't squared away.
[00:50:55] I'm going to go to war.
[00:50:57] Right.
[00:50:58] Just an idiot.
[00:50:59] That's what the situation was.
[00:51:01] And you know, it made me mad if a leader was weak and I would form these antagonistic
[00:51:08] relationships with leaders if I thought that they were weak.
[00:51:13] And one of these bosses eventually that I thought I was better than, right.
[00:51:19] I thought I was smarter than him, right.
[00:51:24] I thought that he was an idiot.
[00:51:28] I should have his job, right.
[00:51:30] How often do you think that, right?
[00:51:32] I should have that guy's job on bed.
[00:51:33] I'm smarter than that.
[00:51:35] And the more I showed this attitude, the worse a relationship got and the less he listened
[00:51:41] to me and the less influence I had over how he did things.
[00:51:47] And therefore, the worse we did and the worse our ability to perform got because he was just
[00:51:56] doing things the way he thought without any good input from anyone below him in the chain
[00:52:01] of command.
[00:52:03] All because I had formed this antagonistic relationship with him, which was bad.
[00:52:07] Because I need not listening to me.
[00:52:09] I think one day, one day I said to myself, if I'm so smart, if I'm such a smart guy, why am I
[00:52:23] losing?
[00:52:26] Why am I losing?
[00:52:29] If I'm so smart, if I am so smart, why can I get this guy to do
[00:52:33] what I want him to do?
[00:52:36] Even though he's my boss, doesn't matter.
[00:52:38] If I'm so smart, I'm so much smarter than him.
[00:52:41] Why can't I get him to do what I want him to do?
[00:52:46] If I'm so smart, how come I can't have more influence over the way we operate?
[00:52:51] If I'm so smart and he's so dumb.
[00:52:55] And that's what I realized.
[00:52:57] That's what I had an awakening, an awakening that instead of blaming
[00:53:03] him for being stupid, I was the one who was being stupid.
[00:53:11] I had lost the ability to influence my boss because I was being stupid and because
[00:53:18] of my ego.
[00:53:20] I literally thought I deserved his job.
[00:53:22] I thought pretty much anyone, anyone that's not a job is job.
[00:53:29] And therefore, since I thought that, I undermined him.
[00:53:34] Instead of supporting him, instead of building a relationship with him, I undermined him.
[00:53:39] Now, once I got humble and I started to build a positive relationship with him instead of
[00:53:47] an antagonistic one, that started to change.
[00:53:53] Because then he started listening to me.
[00:53:55] He started to change some things and my influence over the whole situation became better
[00:54:01] because I now had a relationship with, despite the fact that I liked the guy, despite that
[00:54:06] fact, I built the relationship and the situation got better.
[00:54:10] I had more influence.
[00:54:13] And that became kind of my standard operating procedure.
[00:54:17] Was to build relationships with people.
[00:54:20] Even if I didn't like them to build relationships with people so that I could have more
[00:54:24] influence.
[00:54:25] Now, what does that sound like?
[00:54:28] That sounds like I'm kind of this manipulative to face superficial disingenuous guy.
[00:54:35] That's being devious and conniving.
[00:54:37] Not keeping it real.
[00:54:38] Not keeping it real, right?
[00:54:42] But the fact is, that is not true.
[00:54:44] That's not who I am.
[00:54:46] You want to know who I am?
[00:54:50] I'm a guy that's trying to accomplish the mission.
[00:54:53] That's what I am.
[00:54:54] A guy that is trying to accomplish the mission who is putting my own ego in check to build
[00:55:01] a relationship with someone that I don't like, that I don't respect.
[00:55:04] But what I'm trying to do is improve our operational capability.
[00:55:12] That's what's more important to me.
[00:55:17] Trying to arrange the situation, build the relationship so that we do better not so that
[00:55:24] I get promoted.
[00:55:25] Not so that I'm getting some accolades, but so that we as a team do a better job.
[00:55:33] Put the little feelings aside because I want the team to win.
[00:55:41] So if you're having some trouble getting over your feelings and getting over your ego
[00:55:47] to build relationships for the good of their team, ask yourself the same question, I asked
[00:55:52] myself a long time ago, which is this, if I am so smart, why am I not winning?
[00:56:05] And if you answer that question honestly, then you'll put your ego in check, you'll
[00:56:08] go build the relationships that will make you and your team accomplish the mission and
[00:56:14] win.
[00:56:16] There you go.
[00:56:18] You know what it's funny is we think about like, why you wouldn't like someone, what
[00:56:29] causes you to not like someone, most of the time that's your ego anyways.
[00:56:34] Most of the time that's your ego anyways.
[00:56:37] So you know, you had that story of the, you know, you were consulting somebody.
[00:56:43] It was like a big CEO of the idea.
[00:56:45] Like a lacrosse guy, that story is probably the most common story.
[00:56:51] I mean, the way you handle it different.
[00:56:52] Yeah, but that's the scenario that you started with with us to our soul common men.
[00:56:55] We're, yeah, they rugby the wrong way because right off the bat ECM has some kind of
[00:56:59] competitive figure to you.
[00:57:01] Like, you know, some, you know, competing with in your own mind in whatever.
[00:57:06] And the feelings probably mutual out of the time, you know, so you guys don't like each other.
[00:57:09] You know, one of anything he says, you're, you know, you're already defensive, but it's
[00:57:13] weird man how you can, how that happened.
[00:57:15] Like that's happened in maybe four.
[00:57:17] Not as it wasn't as overt, but just like, you know, I don't like, I went because I, not only
[00:57:23] is he like, when you look at him or whatever, they're kind of competitive with you, but
[00:57:26] maybe they do something just this much different than you, you know, like a just different
[00:57:29] in philosophy or something like that.
[00:57:30] So I was like, oh, let me get in.
[00:57:32] So I got, and then they opened their mouth and say, one word, you know, it's real nice.
[00:57:35] You're like, oh, I love that guy.
[00:57:37] You know, just one little thing, just one little like, hey, I'm cool.
[00:57:39] You know, I like you kind of think.
[00:57:41] And it's like, oh, man.
[00:57:42] Yeah, when they say something humble to you, it disarms your ego and your all of a sudden
[00:57:46] your bros.
[00:57:47] Yeah, so weird.
[00:57:48] But if they don't, if they escalate the ego situation, which then it's very problematic.
[00:57:52] It happens all the time.
[00:57:53] Yeah, it's been a whole time.
[00:57:54] I mean, really, that's the natural course of things, because you do have to put on the
[00:57:57] brakes on your feelings and be okay.
[00:57:59] Let's make a different kind of decision and the automatic one.
[00:58:02] I got to switch to manual real quick.
[00:58:04] And then boom, but the bottom line is you're going to interact with all kinds of different
[00:58:07] people.
[00:58:08] Any kind of team whatsoever, which is most human beings interact with other human beings
[00:58:13] through their job, through their life, through, I mean, you could apply this to your family,
[00:58:16] too, right?
[00:58:17] There's someone in your family that you don't get along with.
[00:58:21] Well, what good does it do?
[00:58:23] Does it make your family unit better when you let those emotions play out and let your
[00:58:28] ego play out?
[00:58:29] No, it doesn't.
[00:58:30] You're better off.
[00:58:31] You'll get further.
[00:58:32] And you'll have a better, you'll have a better life in your family.
[00:58:37] If you put your ego in check and say, you know what, I'm just going to build a relationship
[00:58:41] with this person.
[00:58:42] It's going to make everything better in smoother.
[00:58:44] But it's like, man, if you, I feel like you can take the place of any marriage counselor
[00:58:50] by just saying that for real.
[00:58:52] Like, all you got to do is, and they got to do it.
[00:58:54] But all you got to do is ask, like, is this going to help the relationship with my wife or
[00:58:58] my family, whoever it is in your, is this going to help the relationship if I do this or
[00:59:02] don't do this or isn't going to hurt it?
[00:59:03] And that's it.
[00:59:04] That's a super general question.
[00:59:06] And whatever, but it's so cut and dry most of the time.
[00:59:08] Of course, it's that exception.
[00:59:09] But generally speaking, it's pretty cut and dry.
[00:59:11] I'm going to go, okay.
[00:59:12] And a lot of times, just like I said, it has to do with like your ego or your, you know,
[00:59:16] this, this sense of vengeance, little micro sense of vengeance because I can't believe she
[00:59:21] doesn't respect the fact that I took out the trash.
[00:59:25] You know, she asked me to take the trash all the time.
[00:59:27] Finally, when I do it, nothing, you know, like, tell it.
[00:59:30] It's just that.
[00:59:31] I was talking to the friend of mine and we were talking about, you know, I've talked
[00:59:36] about the mute knee that I had, you know, to the opatune.
[00:59:40] But we had a mute knee.
[00:59:41] We had a mute knee against our, our, paltune commander.
[00:59:44] We fired, he got fired and then the other guy that came in to take his place was like,
[00:59:48] the best guy.
[00:59:49] And I was talking to a guy that worked with him much later when he was a senior senior
[00:59:53] guy.
[00:59:55] And I was telling him, I was like, oh, when I talk on the podcast about the paltune commander,
[01:00:01] that was like the best, that's when I'm talking to he's like, no way.
[01:00:04] And this guy working with these senior guy.
[01:00:08] And he says, you know, when he, when I worked with him, he would take out the trash from
[01:00:12] the office every day.
[01:00:14] And I started laughing about that.
[01:00:17] That's right.
[01:00:18] And I'd be, look, and he was saying, like, oh, I look at him and be like, sir, you
[01:00:21] know, you don't need to do that.
[01:00:22] He's like, no, no, no, it's a good.
[01:00:23] You know, someone's got to take out the trash.
[01:00:24] I got it.
[01:00:25] This is a seat.
[01:00:26] Why that shouldn't have been taking out trash for 25 years.
[01:00:31] Taking out the trash.
[01:00:32] What was he picking up, brass?
[01:00:33] He's picking up brass.
[01:00:34] Taking out trash.
[01:00:35] You know, that's, that's being humble.
[01:00:39] Yeah.
[01:00:40] Being humble goes a long way.
[01:00:42] Yeah.
[01:00:43] Next year.
[01:00:44] We got time for one more.
[01:00:46] Because I got stuffed.
[01:00:48] Sure.
[01:00:49] Hi, Jockel.
[01:00:50] I'm a veteran in graduate school.
[01:00:55] My mother passed away in April, and I took a few weeks off.
[01:00:58] While that was helpful, I'm struggling, returning to work.
[01:01:02] My peers are younger and inexperienced.
[01:01:04] I'm the oldest in the cohort.
[01:01:06] And probably the first vet to come to this grad program.
[01:01:10] I've already had some uphill battles.
[01:01:12] And up to this point, I truly believe I was worthy of my own suffering.
[01:01:16] Now, though, after solving on a plane while listening to episode 122, I don't feel
[01:01:22] as worthy.
[01:01:23] I wasn't there for my mother when she died.
[01:01:25] In fact, I cut her out due to her drinking, which is what killed her.
[01:01:30] I've lost people close to me in the past and in the service, but this is different.
[01:01:36] I know one thing, I'm a fighter.
[01:01:37] I've had to fight all my life to get where I am, but I'm feeling deflated.
[01:01:48] I mean, to start with, of course, you feel deflated.
[01:01:53] Because you lost your mom.
[01:01:57] That's normal.
[01:01:58] But what is not normal and what you have to fight against is staying deflated.
[01:02:07] So, I mean, listen, your mom has gone and you should certainly mourn that.
[01:02:15] You weren't by her side when she died.
[01:02:20] This is due to the fact that you had to cut her off and you had to cut her off because
[01:02:25] of her drinking.
[01:02:27] If you don't cut someone off when they're going down that path, you're only enabling
[01:02:31] them.
[01:02:32] And that is not the right thing to do.
[01:02:39] And of course, we want to be able to save everyone.
[01:02:47] That's absolutely.
[01:02:49] We want to be able to save everyone, especially our own family members.
[01:02:56] But the fact of the matter is that you just can't save everyone.
[01:03:04] No one can.
[01:03:07] No one can.
[01:03:10] Addiction is in many cases stronger than us.
[01:03:18] Even anything stronger than love.
[01:03:23] Believe it or not, stronger than life itself sometimes.
[01:03:27] That's how strong addiction is.
[01:03:33] And you cannot and are not expected to be able to defeat that.
[01:03:46] So you did what you could.
[01:03:53] And in the end, the battle was lost not because of you but because of addiction.
[01:04:05] And it is hard to face that kind of loss.
[01:04:17] But now, how are you going to look at this?
[01:04:22] How are you going to deal with this?
[01:04:28] I look at it like this.
[01:04:30] Your mother?
[01:04:34] Your mother gave you a gift, a precious gift.
[01:04:42] She gave you the gift of knowledge.
[01:04:47] That knowledge allows you to see how destructive that force of addiction can be.
[01:04:54] You saw it, destroy her.
[01:05:00] You saw that addiction, destroy her because she showed it to you.
[01:05:04] That was her last gift to you.
[01:05:09] She's actually given you life twice once at birth and once at her death.
[01:05:18] She's actually shown you how to live by showing you how not to live.
[01:05:26] So thank your mother for that.
[01:05:40] Literally, thank her.
[01:05:41] Literally go to her grave side and get down on your knees and say thank you to her.
[01:05:54] And then tell her that you won't let her down.
[01:05:59] And then tell her that you will learn from her lesson.
[01:06:07] And then tell her that you will go on to live an incredible life.
[01:06:16] A life that she would be proud of, a life that she didn't have.
[01:06:22] But a life that she is making sure you can have.
[01:06:35] Now you said that you're a fighter.
[01:06:39] And that's one thing you know is that you're a fighter.
[01:06:42] Well now get out there.
[01:06:48] And you know that question and kind of thinking about the answer to that question.
[01:07:00] That got me thinking about an article that I read about Anthony Bourdain.
[01:07:06] And Anthony Bourdain, obviously he was about a successful as anyone could be.
[01:07:15] I mean he was a successful guy in so many aspects and yet he killed himself.
[01:07:26] And I didn't know him personally.
[01:07:29] But you know he knew people that I know, he was friends with Joe Rogan.
[01:07:36] He was friends with Harley Flan again.
[01:07:38] He was friends with guys that, guys that look good guys.
[01:07:47] And so in that way I kind of felt like I knew what kind of a guy was at least.
[01:07:56] And even from the outside, even without having any connections to him at all, he was a kind
[01:08:02] of guy that had just about everything that that most people would want.
[01:08:11] And even still I mean obviously that wasn't enough.
[01:08:17] Well in the article that I read there was a quote from Anthony Bourdain's books and the
[01:08:27] book was called A Cooks Tour.
[01:08:32] He said in this book, I wanted adventures.
[01:08:37] I wanted to go up the non-river to the heart of darkness in Cambodia.
[01:08:44] I wanted to ride out into a desert on camelback, sand and dunes in every direction.
[01:08:52] Eat whole roasted lamb with my fingers.
[01:08:57] I wanted to kick snow off my boots in a mafia nightclub in Russia.
[01:09:02] I wanted to play with automatic weapons in Panam Pen.
[01:09:06] Recap for the past in a small oyster village in France.
[01:09:12] Step into a CD, neon lit, pukarilla in rural Mexico.
[01:09:19] I wanted to run road blocks in the middle of the night, blowing past Angry Malaysia with
[01:09:24] a handful of hurled marble packs.
[01:09:31] Experience fear, excitement, wonder.
[01:09:34] I wanted kicks.
[01:09:37] The kind of melodramatic thrills and chills I'd yearn for since childhood.
[01:09:45] The kind of adventure I'd found as a little boy in the pages of my 10-10 comic books.
[01:09:53] I wanted to see the world and I wanted the world to be just like the movies.
[01:10:05] That's what Anthony Bourdain said, just like the movies.
[01:10:17] You know what to me, the world is not like the movies.
[01:10:26] The movies aren't real.
[01:10:28] They don't exist.
[01:10:33] But you do.
[01:10:37] And life, this life is better than any movie there is.
[01:10:44] Is there supposed to provoke emotion?
[01:10:47] Do you supposed to make you feel something?
[01:10:52] But I have a better idea.
[01:10:54] Go out into the world and actually feel it.
[01:11:01] Go feel joy and love and triumph and rapture and ecstasy and glory.
[01:11:10] You'll feel those things.
[01:11:18] And you know with those feelings, there will be other feelings as well.
[01:11:24] There will be sorrow and pain and sadness and desolation and suffering.
[01:11:33] There will be all those feelings too.
[01:11:40] But you know what?
[01:11:46] That's okay.
[01:11:50] That's okay.
[01:11:51] Take both sides.
[01:11:53] Feel all that.
[01:11:54] That's what life is.
[01:11:56] Those feelings, those emotions, those highs and those lows.
[01:12:03] Those are life.
[01:12:10] And those emotions and those feelings are better than any movie because they are real.
[01:12:22] So make your own comic book.
[01:12:28] Make your life your own movie.
[01:12:31] Actually make it better than a movie.
[01:12:35] Not better because it's more adventurous or more romantic or more melodramatic.
[01:12:44] Make it better because it's real.
[01:12:52] It's real so it is better.
[01:12:55] And you know what, real comes with some downsides.
[01:13:02] Real comes with some darkness.
[01:13:13] But that's okay.
[01:13:18] It's okay because when you know the darkness, the light becomes even brighter.
[01:13:24] So go out there, move toward the light, move toward the light and live.
[01:13:46] And I think that's all I've got for tonight.
[01:14:00] So echo, let's talk to people a little bit about how to support this podcast and at
[01:14:12] the same time move themselves a little further away from the darkness and a little bit closer
[01:14:19] to the light.
[01:14:22] Because we make the podcast so everyone can learn and if you want to support the podcast,
[01:14:30] there are some really good ways to do it.
[01:14:33] And that's the goal.
[01:14:37] Podcasting you're supporting yourself at the same time.
[01:14:42] We got a big go hand in hand, a 300,000 percent.
[01:14:47] Not possible but what they were like.
[01:14:48] Yeah that's what I said.
[01:14:49] Can you agree one thing in a highly agree the 110 percent?
[01:14:52] I agree with you but I think I feel 10 percent even more strong than what you just
[01:14:57] said.
[01:14:58] Technically that could be a bad just thing.
[01:15:02] I mean yes so we'll start with Origin, Origin USA in Maine, Farmington Maine to be exact,
[01:15:10] American made products.
[01:15:11] What do we got?
[01:15:12] Okay, guise that's really the flagship.
[01:15:15] I like the word flagship but the flagship product is the guise.
[01:15:21] Made for Gigi to specifically for Gigi to in America.
[01:15:26] So made for specifically to Gigi but usable for many different activities.
[01:15:34] Like making a suit?
[01:15:36] Rashcards.
[01:15:37] Oh yeah.
[01:15:38] Okay, if you say guise it's like flagship right which I agree with.
[01:15:40] They also have rashcards.
[01:15:42] Other stuff.
[01:15:43] Yeah.
[01:15:44] Compression gear.
[01:15:45] Compression gear.
[01:15:46] Spats if you will.
[01:15:48] Yeah, for sure.
[01:15:49] But the guise aren't just like guise though.
[01:15:52] You can see them saying they're not just a general guise that guise made in America.
[01:15:56] By the way, for Gigi to specifically.
[01:16:00] When you move in Gigi to the different than moving in, I don't know whatever else you might
[01:16:04] wear guise.
[01:16:05] That tennis.
[01:16:07] Whatever, you were saying you were going to make a suit with the dragon.
[01:16:10] Yeah, that is kind of crazy.
[01:16:11] I actually have an idea of something to make with the dragon weave.
[01:16:15] I'm going to talk to Pete about.
[01:16:17] All right, what is it, let me stick to reveal.
[01:16:20] Believe it or not, boots.
[01:16:23] Yeah.
[01:16:24] Okay, yeah.
[01:16:25] So they wouldn't be fooled right?
[01:16:26] No, no, they'd be very similar to the old school Vietnam jungle boots.
[01:16:31] But they'd have the dragon weave instead of canvas.
[01:16:34] They'd have dragon weave.
[01:16:36] And because which I think is the, literally the perfect material for the jungle, but old
[01:16:42] school jungle boots are part leather.
[01:16:44] They're like leather around the toe in the heel.
[01:16:47] Then they have canvas on the sides and I wore jungle, and I still wear jungle boots.
[01:16:52] I love jungle boots.
[01:16:53] So yeah.
[01:16:54] So I, but if we made, because the cotton canvas does stay wet longer, but if we use the
[01:17:02] dragon weave, it dries quicker because it's a blend.
[01:17:05] But cotton is also very comfortable to wear.
[01:17:09] It allows circulation.
[01:17:10] So anyways, that's a wild mull talk to Pete.
[01:17:13] We'll make it happen.
[01:17:14] So the, the shorts that I have, if anyone else can have is dragon weave.
[01:17:19] Right.
[01:17:20] That is okay.
[01:17:21] So let's talk to Pete about it.
[01:17:22] Let me make some more and we went to the thing that's holding the other thing.
[01:17:24] But here's, here's what I do remember if you, since you brought up boots.
[01:17:29] Where, okay, so those shorts, you know, I have kids.
[01:17:31] And with kids comes messes, you know, when we're there, spill some, I don't know, whatever.
[01:17:37] So stuff will land on those shorts.
[01:17:38] And you know, the kind of worst thing, I don't want to take off the shorts and go wash
[01:17:41] them like, let me just put some water.
[01:17:43] But then some of the messes is like, you can't just put water.
[01:17:46] It goes away.
[01:17:47] You got to scrub it.
[01:17:48] But if they're like normal shorts, I'm going to scrub it with like a brush and it's
[01:17:50] going to kind of mess up the shorts a little bit right there.
[01:17:52] You know, it'll make it like kind of friddle fray or something like that.
[01:17:56] Brad, now these ones, Brad, I'm scrubbing it with a steel wool thing to get the thing out.
[01:18:00] Brad, the thing is like new still, aside from like the cotton part feeds, right?
[01:18:04] You know how to blend, right?
[01:18:05] So the cotton ones will feed.
[01:18:07] So this is awesome.
[01:18:08] It's a little gray straight with black as Brad's dope incidental, dopeness improvement.
[01:18:15] Yeah.
[01:18:16] In the aesthetic look.
[01:18:17] There you go.
[01:18:18] That's a side note.
[01:18:19] But I'm saying it's tough with the use of them saying, so it kind of makes sense.
[01:18:22] Now, dragonweed boots, boom, you're in the jungle fishing, whatever else we're doing
[01:18:26] with them and they handle.
[01:18:27] Yeah.
[01:18:28] Yeah.
[01:18:29] I don't want to find it.
[01:18:30] Would you make it like on the inside?
[01:18:31] Would it be a, what do you call water?
[01:18:33] We're reset proof through whatever.
[01:18:34] That's the thing with jungle, but you don't want them waterproof.
[01:18:36] They're booting.
[01:18:37] They're really, really, you have little eyelets.
[01:18:39] Oh yeah.
[01:18:40] Little drains.
[01:18:41] So you want them highly breathable.
[01:18:43] Like not even breathable.
[01:18:45] Open.
[01:18:46] Yeah.
[01:18:47] There's holes.
[01:18:48] It's purposely put in there.
[01:18:49] So that's concept is real jujitsu ish, you know?
[01:18:52] Cause like on at first thought, you'd be like, hey, you're walking water.
[01:18:55] We need to fight that water.
[01:18:56] No, it's like, yeah, allow the water.
[01:18:58] You didn't allow the water out there.
[01:19:00] Yeah, man.
[01:19:01] That's good.
[01:19:02] See Brad, that's why you're advanced.
[01:19:03] See, you think about this can see.
[01:19:05] Speaking of being advanced and comfortable.
[01:19:08] Advanced comfort with the joggers and the sweats.
[01:19:11] It's my experience.
[01:19:12] Try for yourself.
[01:19:13] Many people actually, I saw a guy today, maybe yesterday, today.
[01:19:16] I forgot.
[01:19:17] But he got the hoodie, one of, origins hoodie, boom, seconded that exact notion.
[01:19:22] Most comfortable hoodie ever.
[01:19:23] He's ever had.
[01:19:24] That's a bold statement.
[01:19:25] And I could just seat tell from his profile picture that he knew about comfort.
[01:19:29] I don't know.
[01:19:30] It just, I just could feel it.
[01:19:32] Nonetheless, it happened.
[01:19:33] Factually.
[01:19:34] Also, we got some supplements up there on the origin.
[01:19:38] Main.com website.
[01:19:41] You can get some supplements.
[01:19:42] What kind of supplements, pal?
[01:19:44] Some good ones.
[01:19:45] Yep.
[01:19:46] So, joint warfare.
[01:19:48] Darwin, would we call that one a flagship supplement?
[01:19:51] You could call every time.
[01:19:52] I'm going to call that a flagship.
[01:19:53] Yeah, the flagship is good, man.
[01:19:55] By the way, someone said, someone said on social media.
[01:19:59] Go back to the old way you were doing this approach.
[01:20:02] Then, no way, he sounds clunky.
[01:20:05] He said, give it back to echo.
[01:20:07] He said, you know what I said?
[01:20:09] Couldn't take it anymore.
[01:20:10] He said, I'm going to be honest.
[01:20:13] I will accept the possibility, probability of you not being the only one that thought
[01:20:19] that.
[01:20:20] So, I'm going to go with it.
[01:20:22] You know, there was that one guy though.
[01:20:24] He was fired up.
[01:20:25] Enough to tweet me.
[01:20:26] And say, bra.
[01:20:28] Sounds clunky.
[01:20:29] Dang, I kind of appreciated it.
[01:20:30] You're so far.
[01:20:31] Really do another thing.
[01:20:32] We could have a separate podcast where you could just do so far.
[01:20:35] It's a whole lot.
[01:20:36] Yeah, yeah, yeah, you can kind of choose.
[01:20:39] Choose your own support.
[01:20:41] Yeah, maybe.
[01:20:42] Nonetheless, for now, this is what we're doing.
[01:20:44] We're going with joint warfare.
[01:20:46] Joy warfare.
[01:20:47] Good for your joints.
[01:20:48] Or make a three is good for your joints.
[01:20:50] And that's in krill oil.
[01:20:51] So you got joint warfare, glucosiming, conjointing, and curcumint.
[01:20:54] That helps you bring by the way.
[01:20:56] As we find out.
[01:20:57] Additionally, then you got a joint.
[01:21:00] That's a lot of pressure.
[01:21:01] Yeah.
[01:21:02] Ronda Patrick, right?
[01:21:03] Yeah.
[01:21:04] It was like I read that two by the way.
[01:21:06] It's good.
[01:21:07] Then you got, okay, so you got joint warfare, boom.
[01:21:09] We close them in conjointing.
[01:21:10] That's for, I think, cardilegium, phamountmistic, and joints, all this stuff.
[01:21:14] Boom, curcumint for some brains and memory stuff, boom.
[01:21:16] That's joint warfare.
[01:21:17] Then you got jacos, super krill.
[01:21:19] Mm-hmm.
[01:21:20] That's for you joint.
[01:21:21] So make a threes.
[01:21:22] And that's also for other parts of your anatomy.
[01:21:24] Yeah.
[01:21:25] It will say your whole internal system.
[01:21:29] You may use your eyes.
[01:21:30] Eyeballs.
[01:21:31] Eyeballs.
[01:21:32] Eyeballs.
[01:21:33] Eyeballs.
[01:21:34] Organs.
[01:21:35] Can you crack open a krill oil capsule and put it directly into your eyes?
[01:21:37] Is that a good thing?
[01:21:38] Yeah.
[01:21:39] I'm assuming no.
[01:21:40] I'm not sure.
[01:21:42] Yeah.
[01:21:43] But yeah, let's not do that, I think.
[01:21:44] I've been on krill oil for so long.
[01:21:47] Yeah.
[01:21:48] People, like, I don't want to ever go off with it.
[01:21:51] Yeah, I think that's a good idea to never go off of it.
[01:21:55] The reason is because I had a guy many years ago that was a, this is when I was
[01:21:59] probably 35.
[01:22:03] I met a guy that was 53.
[01:22:06] I think.
[01:22:07] And he was jerked.
[01:22:09] And he was jacked, but he wasn't jacked like a big body builder juice up guy.
[01:22:15] Just jacked like totally athletic.
[01:22:17] And in really great shape.
[01:22:19] And I was like, hey man, what's the deal with, you know, and he's like, I take it all
[01:22:23] oil.
[01:22:24] That's, he's like, that's the secret.
[01:22:25] He was like tributing.
[01:22:26] Yeah.
[01:22:27] Yeah.
[01:22:28] And so, how he was a competitive power lifter at one time.
[01:22:31] So he had maintained and continued to work out.
[01:22:34] But he was basically saying that to me as if we already knew that.
[01:22:38] But we already know that you got a jacked deal.
[01:22:40] Like, we, that's a given.
[01:22:41] I just, because I was talking to him for a while.
[01:22:43] And we were talking about lifting or talking about this.
[01:22:45] And, and then finally, you know, I got to like, so what do you think it is?
[01:22:48] And he's like, I take it all oil.
[01:22:50] This was before, and I was like, okay.
[01:22:52] Sometimes when somebody tells you something, you're just like, you just look at the guy.
[01:22:56] And when they give that much weight to it, yeah.
[01:22:59] It's like, okay, we're going with that.
[01:23:01] Yeah.
[01:23:02] And what's cool is that's, that's, that's, I definitely, I definitely felt the difference
[01:23:07] in my joints.
[01:23:10] Yeah.
[01:23:11] I don't know about my eyeballs.
[01:23:12] Well, you know, although I don't see glasses at this point.
[01:23:15] Yeah, there it is, proof of what that's.
[01:23:16] That's, that's something.
[01:23:17] Yeah.
[01:23:18] It's not nothing.
[01:23:19] That's for sure.
[01:23:20] And the same way you, you, um, well, not in the same way.
[01:23:23] But slightly similar way you had the power lift your guy, talk about Krillale.
[01:23:27] My father-in-law, as I've mentioned before, told me about Krillale.
[01:23:31] But way better than fish oil.
[01:23:32] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:23:33] And you know, he's telling me, or, what was he jacked?
[01:23:35] He, here's the thing.
[01:23:36] He wasn't, isn't jacked.
[01:23:37] And here's part of the whole story, which kind of is going to kind of feed into your
[01:23:41] point.
[01:23:42] No, he is not jacked at all.
[01:23:44] In fact, medium go left by this guy.
[01:23:46] She didn't even be in the same gym with me.
[01:23:49] He should be in the, the gym, maybe he's going to hear this podcast.
[01:23:51] I don't care.
[01:23:52] Absolutely 100%.
[01:23:53] Sure.
[01:23:54] Not really doing a good job building that relationship with the family.
[01:23:57] At the end of the day, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, you'll see the moral.
[01:24:00] And I think it, well, I think it will.
[01:24:02] Anyway, so no, not jacked the answer is no.
[01:24:05] He can swim forever, ever.
[01:24:07] In fact, he goes in Hawaii.
[01:24:09] Men Maui waters with the, you know, the web hands, you know, for swimming.
[01:24:13] Okay.
[01:24:14] Some body bodies, you know, they're just web spongers.
[01:24:16] Yeah, sure.
[01:24:17] He doesn't, he's not a sponge, but he's swimmer.
[01:24:20] So he'll just swim our boom, just swim it.
[01:24:23] Anyway, he'd always say, you know, krill oil, all this stuff.
[01:24:27] But yeah, he's not jacked.
[01:24:28] He doesn't lift like why he could use take krill oil.
[01:24:30] And you get your XYZ results cool.
[01:24:32] I don't want those XYZ results.
[01:24:35] Those results that you're essentially benefiting from apparently.
[01:24:38] I don't apply to my goals.
[01:24:39] I don't, I don't.
[01:24:40] Exactly.
[01:24:41] So I'm like, okay, cool, I get it.
[01:24:44] Health not.
[01:24:45] He's the health not.
[01:24:46] He's into health.
[01:24:47] That's a positive thing.
[01:24:48] There's, there is worse things to be and not about.
[01:24:50] I'll tell you that.
[01:24:51] Health is a good thing anyway.
[01:24:52] But it's a good thing.
[01:24:53] It's a little bit better to be health.
[01:24:54] But that's jacked.
[01:24:55] I'm not going to disagree.
[01:24:58] So, you know, for years, I'm like, cool, good.
[01:25:01] It's rather info.
[01:25:02] Yeah, then you come along and you're like, yeah, krill oil.
[01:25:05] Boom, next day, I'm on the krill oil.
[01:25:07] Literally next day.
[01:25:08] And so, of course, he's been saying it the whole time or whatever.
[01:25:12] But at the end of the day, he's right.
[01:25:15] He's absolutely right.
[01:25:16] He was right.
[01:25:16] Yeah.
[01:25:17] So the normal of the story is you could be right and not jacked.
[01:25:22] Yes, jacked.
[01:25:23] I got to kind of separate, you know, my, what he called, I got to detach.
[01:25:29] This is what I got to do.
[01:25:30] You know, true.
[01:25:31] Like, an older guy with the ability to do the things and at the health level, he's at,
[01:25:34] I do want for myself, regardless how much weight I can lift or can't lift.
[01:25:39] That's what I want.
[01:25:40] That's what I want.
[01:25:41] Yeah, yeah.
[01:25:42] Big time.
[01:25:43] And here's the thing, I didn't think indirectly as well.
[01:25:45] Because the better your joint feels special is you get older, but just in life, regardless
[01:25:49] how old you're, the better your joints are functioning, the more you're going to be
[01:25:52] able to lift or mounting climb or right bike or compete in baggling.
[01:26:00] Midden.
[01:26:01] Bad midden.
[01:26:02] How do you say that?
[01:26:03] Bad midden.
[01:26:04] Yeah, competing that.
[01:26:05] That's true.
[01:26:06] Bad.
[01:26:07] You don't need tennis or bad midden elbow, you know, for, you know, I,
[01:26:11] I, I, I, I, I, I.
[01:26:16] That's the one, I'll make it three.
[01:26:18] And then you have discipline, right.
[01:26:20] And that's for your brain memory, how many things.
[01:26:22] So they play into each other, is you're insane.
[01:26:24] So the joint warfare has the brain stuff and the joint stuff.
[01:26:25] Crilt oil has the joint stuff.
[01:26:26] Really good day at your Jitsu the other day.
[01:26:27] And I was talking to Dave Burke on my way home from Jitsu.
[01:26:30] Good deal, dude.
[01:26:31] Yeah, good deal, Dave.
[01:26:32] And I was like, you know, you said only I trained today.
[01:26:35] I was like, I had a really good day at that.
[01:26:39] So he's like, what does that mean?
[01:26:40] I'll just mean, you know, like, just getting after just.
[01:26:44] And I realized that the past anyways, I realized that I've been taking like three
[01:26:49] scoops of discipline.
[01:26:50] I'm not going to try.
[01:26:51] Oh, okay.
[01:26:52] Oh, is that illegal?
[01:26:53] Yeah, well, you know, I, you know, you may be, it could be it should be maybe, yeah.
[01:26:58] Well, you depends on what you mean by fair.
[01:27:00] Because if you're going into compete with your training partners, which you do from
[01:27:03] time to time, let's face it.
[01:27:05] And yeah, it's a little bit of an advantage.
[01:27:07] Yeah, fair.
[01:27:08] No, it's ashes.
[01:27:09] It's ashes, fair.
[01:27:10] Andy, or wherever you go into training with, D, me, we could take three things
[01:27:16] that discipline.
[01:27:17] If you wanted to.
[01:27:18] One or two, it's fair.
[01:27:19] It's fair.
[01:27:20] In fact, I recommend take three things at discipline.
[01:27:22] Boom.
[01:27:23] There it is.
[01:27:24] Dislink.
[01:27:25] Cognitive enhancing.
[01:27:26] So they all play with each other.
[01:27:27] That's important.
[01:27:28] Very important.
[01:27:29] I think.
[01:27:31] Regardless how much you can live.
[01:27:34] Yeah, check.
[01:27:35] Also, milk.
[01:27:37] What is milk?
[01:27:40] Who is someone who's just asking about milk?
[01:27:43] And the best thing about when people ask you what milk is is you get it.
[01:27:46] You get a chance to do the routine.
[01:27:48] Right?
[01:27:49] You get a chance to do the routine.
[01:27:51] Well, someone's like, no, what's milk?
[01:27:53] What's milk?
[01:27:54] What's milk?
[01:27:55] Yeah.
[01:27:56] You get to do the routine, which is what's milk?
[01:27:58] Oh, it's milk.
[01:27:59] That's the routine.
[01:28:00] That's the routine.
[01:28:01] You remember what is it?
[01:28:02] It's milk.
[01:28:03] No, it's milk.
[01:28:04] You want some kind of explanation.
[01:28:05] You're like, no, no.
[01:28:06] It's milk.
[01:28:07] Yeah, yeah.
[01:28:08] Common sense.
[01:28:09] Really?
[01:28:10] How do you say that?
[01:28:11] You just take common sense from there and boom, clear.
[01:28:13] Yeah.
[01:28:14] That's my goal.
[01:28:16] My goal is that it ends up in the Oxford English dictionary.
[01:28:20] Yeah.
[01:28:21] Like zerox.
[01:28:22] And then if someone doesn't know what it is, they can just go look it up.
[01:28:24] Yeah, look it up.
[01:28:25] That's in the dictionary by the way.
[01:28:26] Yeah.
[01:28:27] That's my goal.
[01:28:28] Like Google is Google in there for like, yes.
[01:28:29] Yes.
[01:28:30] It's a girl living in a room.
[01:28:31] Go Google that.
[01:28:32] Yeah.
[01:28:33] So Google.
[01:28:34] So Google.
[01:28:35] Yeah.
[01:28:35] Yeah.
[01:28:36] There.
[01:28:37] You'll find it.
[01:28:38] Yes.
[01:28:39] You'll know what it is.
[01:28:40] Well, you'll know that it's tasty.
[01:28:41] The guy that said, hey, I don't use protein powders.
[01:28:46] But does it taste that good?
[01:28:48] I should just get it anyways.
[01:28:50] My answer was 100% resounding.
[01:28:52] Absolutely.
[01:28:53] Yeah.
[01:28:54] You just want to have a really good dessert.
[01:28:56] Yeah.
[01:28:57] Peanut butter is coming.
[01:28:58] So Dave Burke is on the path to order all the peanut butter.
[01:29:06] They're chocolate anyways.
[01:29:07] Oh, the whole supply.
[01:29:08] Yeah.
[01:29:09] You want to also supply.
[01:29:10] Not a bad idea.
[01:29:11] Yeah.
[01:29:12] Yeah.
[01:29:13] So yeah.
[01:29:14] If you don't know, molek look.
[01:29:15] I'm going to violate some terminology scenarios here.
[01:29:17] Molek is protein powder.
[01:29:19] It's actually molek.
[01:29:21] Yeah, man.
[01:29:22] The best protein powder.
[01:29:24] That tastes like a dessert straight up does though.
[01:29:26] Not just claims and doesn't.
[01:29:28] It does straight up.
[01:29:30] Literally.
[01:29:31] And we will have molek at the immersion camp.
[01:29:33] This summer up in Maine.
[01:29:35] Echo Lake layers August 26th through September 2nd.
[01:29:39] Two sessions come up there.
[01:29:40] I'll be there.
[01:29:41] Lave will be there.
[01:29:43] Echo Charles will be there.
[01:29:44] And apparently you say you will be rolling.
[01:29:46] Yeah, limited.
[01:29:47] Okay.
[01:29:48] Limited rolling from from which sounds like pre-determined excuses.
[01:29:51] Which is fine.
[01:29:52] Yeah.
[01:29:53] Well, here.
[01:29:54] Okay.
[01:29:55] All right.
[01:29:56] We'll let him lay it out then.
[01:29:56] Playboy.
[01:29:57] The.
[01:29:58] The ghee.
[01:29:59] I'll be doing less of because ghee has a lot of
[01:30:01] sugar.
[01:30:06] So pulling.
[01:30:07] I'm really.
[01:30:08] I'm out of pulling.
[01:30:09] I can't do pulling.
[01:30:10] Very limited.
[01:30:11] Maybe with one hand.
[01:30:12] So I'll do ghee.
[01:30:13] But it's like, okay.
[01:30:14] Now I'm rolling literally with one hand.
[01:30:15] By the way, ghee.
[01:30:16] We'll be there.
[01:30:17] Yeah.
[01:30:18] Dean Lister will be there.
[01:30:19] And if you want to learn from someone, he is one of the top people.
[01:30:20] In the world to learn from.
[01:30:21] And I know that's a bold statement.
[01:30:22] Yeah.
[01:30:23] I know it is.
[01:30:24] He's got a mind that understands not only the mechanics.
[01:30:29] And the concepts of the jitsu.
[01:30:33] Added at it.
[01:30:34] But one of the highest levels of anyone ever recomunicated with.
[01:30:37] But also knows how to express those concepts in a very clear way.
[01:30:41] So immersion camp.
[01:30:44] August 26 through September 2nd.
[01:30:46] Go and come up there.
[01:30:48] We'll see you up there.
[01:30:49] Good places.
[01:30:50] And we will have more.
[01:30:51] Yes.
[01:30:52] Lots of it.
[01:30:53] And Dean's good at kind of taking the concept and really clarifying the concept.
[01:30:57] Even separate from the actor.
[01:30:59] I mean, the moves always attach.
[01:31:00] But Dean says things sometimes that I run over and take a little note on my phone.
[01:31:06] Yeah.
[01:31:07] Yeah.
[01:31:08] I'm going to call it.
[01:31:09] That's a good one.
[01:31:10] Usually I'm thinking I'm going to when he comes on the podcast.
[01:31:13] I'm going to talk about those things.
[01:31:15] So I hope you know, mum.
[01:31:17] Also, good way to support is the fact.
[01:31:20] We're on top of the fact.
[01:31:22] Where is part of the fact that chocolate is on store?
[01:31:25] It's called jocquistore.
[01:31:27] It's going to jocquistore.com for these items.
[01:31:30] It's where you can get rash cards.
[01:31:32] You can definitely get rash cards.
[01:31:33] Yes.
[01:31:34] Get after it.
[01:31:35] T-shirts.
[01:31:37] A bunch of t-shirts.
[01:31:38] Yeah.
[01:31:39] They want to say discipline equals freedom.
[01:31:40] New t-shirt coming.
[01:31:41] New t-shirts are coming.
[01:31:44] Oh t-shirts with pearls.
[01:31:45] Yeah.
[01:31:46] Oh dang.
[01:31:47] Two of them.
[01:31:48] If, yeah.
[01:31:49] If you're interested in the t-shirts,
[01:31:51] they want to say discipline equals freedom.
[01:31:52] It's a good one.
[01:31:53] I get revealed how deep the expression discipline equals freedom goes.
[01:32:02] Like almost date and that not daily.
[01:32:04] But let's say once you understand it at a deep level,
[01:32:08] deeper and less present it to reveal to you how important it is.
[01:32:10] Yes.
[01:32:11] How much even more than I proved for previously thought the week before.
[01:32:14] It's almost like it has no limit to the layers.
[01:32:17] It's pretty important.
[01:32:18] Yeah.
[01:32:19] Actually, I've been sporting the discipline equals freedom.
[01:32:24] The trucker hat.
[01:32:27] So, and I also have the deaf beanie.
[01:32:32] Yes.
[01:32:33] Yeah.
[01:32:33] That's a good one.
[01:32:34] So you got that.
[01:32:35] That was available.
[01:32:36] Check.
[01:32:37] Yep.
[01:32:38] Yes.
[01:32:39] And also, hoodies.
[01:32:41] Heavy hoodies.
[01:32:43] And light noodies.
[01:32:44] I know, I know, I know.
[01:32:45] But I have been getting feedback
[01:32:48] online and offline, by the way, for the light hoodie.
[01:32:53] People just love them.
[01:32:55] They want the light hoodie man.
[01:32:57] They want to represent, you know, like I said.
[01:33:00] That's a Hawaii.
[01:33:01] I'm telling you.
[01:33:02] There are times.
[01:33:03] All your friends.
[01:33:04] They're Hawaii.
[01:33:05] All them, everybody.
[01:33:06] And all the ohan and Hawaii's hit me up.
[01:33:09] Become a Ina.
[01:33:10] All them.
[01:33:11] Yes.
[01:33:12] And because in Hawaii and other places here,
[01:33:14] let's face it.
[01:33:15] There are times where it's like, hey,
[01:33:16] like yesterday was one of them.
[01:33:18] It's like, bro, it's kind of cold.
[01:33:21] But it's not cold.
[01:33:22] It's kind of cold.
[01:33:23] If you were a t-shirt, it's like, man, this environment.
[01:33:26] Whether is offering.
[01:33:30] It's not offering.
[01:33:31] Not feed.
[01:33:32] No, go dev.
[01:33:33] No, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:33:35] Negative.
[01:33:36] Nope.
[01:33:37] That's not to me,
[01:33:38] especially if you're at like a little gathering.
[01:33:41] Social.
[01:33:42] Social.
[01:33:46] It's a situation.
[01:33:47] It's maybe.
[01:33:48] It could be looked at as paramount.
[01:33:50] But here's what it is.
[01:33:51] If the if the weather, whatever,
[01:33:54] environment is offering slight discomfort.
[01:33:57] You know, you have a right.
[01:33:58] You know, I'm laughing so hard right now.
[01:34:00] Because everything you're saying is things that I wouldn't allow myself or anyone of my
[01:34:04] immediate family to say.
[01:34:05] It doesn't make it.
[01:34:07] It doesn't make it anymore true.
[01:34:08] That's the thing.
[01:34:09] So hey, look, I mean, you're cruising.
[01:34:11] Right outside.
[01:34:12] Maybe not you.
[01:34:13] I can't.
[01:34:14] If me and their, I don't think you did it.
[01:34:15] I don't think you do.
[01:34:16] That's the thing.
[01:34:17] If me and Dave work were cruising.
[01:34:19] Oh, maybe he'd want them on.
[01:34:20] And yeah, it's like it just maybe three degrees too cold.
[01:34:24] Yeah, you can suck it up.
[01:34:26] But what?
[01:34:27] Why you got to endure discomfort at times when it's not necessary?
[01:34:30] Unless you're exercising your tolerance for discomfort.
[01:34:33] You should be.
[01:34:34] Which you should add all point at all times.
[01:34:35] That's what you're saying.
[01:34:36] Affirmative.
[01:34:37] No, okay.
[01:34:38] Me and Dave, we don't agree with this.
[01:34:39] So you put on a regular hoodie or heavy or even a medium hoodie after what?
[01:34:44] Five minutes, six minutes.
[01:34:46] We worked out earlier today, whatever that he is too hot.
[01:34:50] So thick hoodie too hot.
[01:34:51] No hoodie too cold.
[01:34:53] Boom, light hoodie perfect.
[01:34:56] Because you don't know about that perfection.
[01:34:58] You know, that caught me, man.
[01:35:00] You know, this own balance, this own.
[01:35:02] Anyway, light hoodie.
[01:35:03] This one equals freedom.
[01:35:05] That's the freedom part.
[01:35:07] Boom.
[01:35:08] Women's stuff as well.
[01:35:09] By the way, women's t-shirts specifically for the ladies.
[01:35:15] And tank tops.

[01:36:21] And you know, so sometimes you don't want to listen to,
[01:36:23] let's say you listen to podcast number 100,
[01:36:26] one.
[01:36:27] And you're like, hey, there's some good stuff in there.
[01:36:29] But should I listen to the whole,

[01:36:49] By the way.
[01:36:50] Also.
[01:36:51] On it.
[01:36:53] On it.com slash chocolate.
[01:36:55] This is where I get all my kettlebells.
[01:36:58] I won't say all my socks, but a lot of socks.
[01:37:00] That's where I get them from.
[01:37:01] I know, sounds weird.
[01:37:02] But man, some of those things.
[01:37:04] Sometimes you appreciate the socks you're wearing,
[01:37:06] especially when you're going through the airport.
[01:37:08] TSA, boom, you gotta take off your shoes.
[01:37:09] Boom, hit them with the on it socks.
[01:37:11] Anyway, fitness gear mainly.
[01:37:14] I think that's what I go.
[01:37:15] And for the information too.
[01:37:17] By the way, like kettlebells.
[01:37:18] What I started kettlebells?
[01:37:19] I heard good things.
[01:37:20] You know, start the kettlebells.
[01:37:22] They're kind of, they're intimidating.
[01:37:24] So boom, going on it.
[01:37:26] .com.
[01:37:27] They have all the info on there.
[01:37:28] Little things about form.
[01:37:30] Little workouts.
[01:37:31] Really good.
[01:37:32] Good on maces too.
[01:37:33] Are they called battle maces?
[01:37:35] Just maces.
[01:37:36] They're steel sticks.
[01:37:40] Clubs.
[01:37:41] Clubs that look like the juggling clubs.
[01:37:44] Yeah.
[01:37:45] But they have one thing there.
[01:37:46] You can't juggle.
[01:37:47] That's the thing.
[01:37:48] If you could juggle those, you'd be a, you'd be a complete badass.
[01:37:51] If you'd juggle those 20 pounders.
[01:37:53] They're freaking heavy.
[01:37:54] Yeah.
[01:37:55] And they're heavier than they sound when you say 20 pounds.
[01:37:58] Yeah, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:37:59] It's all the time.
[01:38:00] It's all the time.
[01:38:01] They're heavy.
[01:38:02] The only way they're 20 pounds.
[01:38:04] The only way they're even, they can even justify saying 20 pounds is when you actually
[01:38:08] put them on the scale and the number of happens.
[01:38:10] Because it's the same 20.
[01:38:11] Otherwise, it's not 20.
[01:38:12] You think they were not made out of metal, but some, you know, something from outer space.
[01:38:16] If you brought them to the airport and you know when you're checking in, you know, and you put the
[01:38:20] your luggage on the scale and you know you were pushing it, you know that it may be over 50 pounds
[01:38:25] and you're like nervous.
[01:38:26] Right.
[01:38:27] And then it doesn't hit 50 pounds.
[01:38:32] If you got that mace, you have that mace in your hand.
[01:38:34] You're about to put that on the scale.
[01:38:35] You know, you know, this is going over.
[01:38:37] I'm paying that extra overage of feet.
[01:38:40] That's what it feels like.
[01:38:41] It's as far as the mace goes.
[01:38:43] Anyway, happens to be a good thing to work out with.
[01:38:45] But you grabbed that thing.
[01:38:46] You're me like, okay, what kind of workout I'm going to do this?
[01:38:48] Boom on it.
[01:38:49] Talk com slash drucko.
[01:38:50] Look up the workout.
[01:38:51] You got it.
[01:38:52] Also psychological warfare.
[01:38:54] It's an album that has various tracks on it that you can.
[01:38:56] Play to push you through moments of weakness.
[01:39:01] And we are we are formulating psychological warfare to all your excuses are lies.
[01:39:07] Yes.
[01:39:08] Working time working time working time.
[01:39:10] But it's pretty good title.
[01:39:12] Also, juggle like tea.
[01:39:14] There's a thing.
[01:39:15] I'm a tea drinker now.
[01:39:16] I don't know if you know that.
[01:39:18] I'm a tea drinker now.
[01:39:19] I drink tea regularly.
[01:39:20] I think that's kind of all it takes really.
[01:39:22] But.
[01:39:24] There was a whole thing when I didn't realize I didn't know that tea drinker had like some stereotypical thing behind it.
[01:39:36] Yeah, yeah.
[01:39:36] So when I get on this schema, white tea people are, that's really weird.
[01:39:39] But you'd make tea because they think I'd I'd be making.
[01:39:42] What a work.
[01:39:43] Malk.
[01:39:44] Yeah.
[01:39:45] Yeah.
[01:39:45] They think I'd make more, but they wouldn't think I'd strike me as a tea drinker.
[01:39:48] I didn't realize that.
[01:39:50] So I guess we're changing the paradigm and those stereotypes will not be.
[01:39:53] Well, not be expecting you didn't accept it anymore.
[01:39:56] Oh, agreed.
[01:39:57] I drink tea and I'm proud.
[01:39:58] Maybe you're changing you're just evolving this stereotype.
[01:40:02] Maybe because you are a tea drinker.
[01:40:03] I'll straighten up.
[01:40:04] I've been drinking tea since day one.
[01:40:06] Not really since day one, but since I figured out.
[01:40:08] Day two.
[01:40:09] Yeah.
[01:40:10] Day two.
[01:40:11] There you go.
[01:40:12] Boom.
[01:40:13] Yeah.
[01:40:14] So juggle white tea, pomegranate, all organic certified by the way.
[01:40:17] Because you know, juggle cares about that kind of stuff.
[01:40:20] In the bags and in the can.
[01:40:22] Big deal.
[01:40:23] And the most tea drinkers care about certified organic.
[01:40:25] Yeah, like it.
[01:40:26] That's another stereotype.
[01:40:27] So GMO tea.
[01:40:28] No good.
[01:40:29] No good.
[01:40:30] We don't have that.
[01:40:31] We'll not put that in my body.
[01:40:32] Yeah, you're right.
[01:40:34] Agreed.
[01:40:35] You get it on Amazon.
[01:40:36] Yeah.
[01:40:37] In fact, I think that's the only place you can get it.
[01:40:39] Well, it is the only place you can get it right now.
[01:40:41] And important fact, there's dry white tea that you put in a brew.
[01:40:45] And then there's the new thing, which is in a can.
[01:40:49] Yeah.
[01:40:50] And the thing that's fired up right now is people that are replacing the 12 or not
[01:40:55] the 12, but they're replacing the four energy drinks.
[01:40:59] Yeah.
[01:41:00] Which actually give you no energy.
[01:41:01] They actually sap your energy and crush your soul and turn you into a health disaster.
[01:41:07] People are replacing that crap with juggle white tea in a can.
[01:41:12] One day it's going to be everywhere.
[01:41:14] That's my suspicion.
[01:41:15] Yeah.
[01:41:16] You're just going to be people will just be, well, you know, the one you're not going
[01:41:18] to like, on.
[01:41:19] You know, speaking of, oh, you're also available in Canada.
[01:41:22] I know a lot of Canadian folks say, wait, is this stuff?

[01:41:53] Way of the word kid from Wimpy to Warrior.
[01:41:56] Right.
[01:41:57] That's the what do you call it after the colon that part.

[01:42:00] Sure.
[01:42:01] There it is.
[01:42:02] Wimpy to work.
[01:42:03] And then the second one is Mark's mission.
[01:42:05] Really clever evolution of problems to be solved in both.
[01:42:09] So now you have the ethos.
[01:42:11] Okay.

[01:42:18] And about time many kids become a거 and many kids would be fake.
[01:42:19] I forgot about individual models, they have actual technologies.

[01:42:42] But yeah, it's a good one also the discipline equals freedom field manual
[01:42:47] It's field manual that's kind of manual in my opinion, but this is like a manual for life
[01:42:52] I think it's like a very basic backbone for life
[01:42:55] It is start there you'll be you'll be solid. I'm always stoked when I meet someone that comes up and it's like
[01:43:02] Real bad you will you?
[01:43:04] I'm on the path. They're like they're not kidding. They're on the path
[01:43:07] Yeah, crack that thing open read two pages read two pages to prep

[01:43:27] You can also get extreme ownership
[01:43:29] Extreme ownership you can get the the the hard cover book
[01:43:33] Mm-hmm and you can also get the audible that one you can get the audible version and the audible version is
[01:43:41] Lafe and I reading
[01:43:44] That book
[01:43:46] That's that's who's reading it that's who's doing the narration and then
[01:43:51] Also, life and I have a book called the dichotomy of leadership
[01:43:55] Which I've talked about dichotomy all the time on this podcast the reason I talk about it's because it's hard to
[01:44:00] I
[01:44:02] Don't even say master. It's hard to even get a grip on that dichotomy the different dichotomy is inside of leadership
[01:44:07] Mm-hmm and so Lafe and I knew that we had to go into a more granular level of explanation of the dichotomy of leadership
[01:44:14] And that's what this new book is it comes out September
[01:44:19] 25th and also for leadership training live inside your organization whatever that organization might be
[01:44:26] Check out my company Ashland front leadership consulting we solve problems through leadership
[01:44:33] That's that we have one more master in 2018 the
[01:44:39] Master is a
[01:44:41] Leadership conference we have one more in 2018 it is in San Francisco October 17th and 18th
[01:44:48] October 17th and 18th all the other ones that we've done have sold out
[01:44:52] If you want to come get your ticket you can get an extreme ownership dot com and also for current
[01:44:59] uniform personnel so people in the military law enforcement board patrol firefighters
[01:45:04] Paramedics first responders we have a roll call number one
[01:45:09] September 21st in Dallas, Texas
[01:45:11] That's also you can also register for that extreme ownership dot com
[01:45:16] That's one day focused on the dynamic leadership
[01:45:20] Environment so that's like a
[01:45:23] Master more focused on the issues of first responders, essentially, yeah, but it is essentially a master
[01:45:30] It's a mustard like shorter. It's a shorter master. It's more focused. It's a cheaper price point and it's one day. There's less
[01:45:41] A menteties right so when you come to the master everything's kind of
[01:45:45] Kind of decked out like the lunch meals really good the dinners great
[01:45:50] It's like decked out to take into the highest level the
[01:45:55] Roll call is like hey, we're here to get the information out to people that need it
[01:46:00] People that are in the field every day whether it's in the military whether it's on the beat is a cop
[01:46:03] Whether it's a firefighter, you know for people that are on the job people in uniform that we try and support
[01:46:10] They need this leadership training. They asked for this leadership training
[01:46:13] We needed to do an energy preprisepoint. What could we save money? You still get it done. There you go
[01:46:17] That's what that's what that's what the roll call is but it's the same deal as far as there's no backstage
[01:46:21] Oh, no, that's the game
[01:46:24] Talking everybody the whole day. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'll be there no
[01:46:29] green room and
