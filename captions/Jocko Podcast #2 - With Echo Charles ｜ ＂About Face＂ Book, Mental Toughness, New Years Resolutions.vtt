00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Welcome. This is Jocco podcast number two with echo Charles and me, Jocco Willink.

2
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:23.50
Good evening, I go. Good evening. So people ask me regularly what books I like. In fact, Tim Ferris asked me,

3
00:00:23.50 --> 00:00:33.000
which he asks all of his guests, what books I have given to people, what books I regularly give to people.

4
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:42.50
How do I, what books do I gift, which I actually am not a real big gift gift gift for some reason?

5
00:00:42.50 --> 00:00:52.50
I don't know why, but I don't really expect gifts from people and people of the world that should not expect gifts from me either.

6
00:00:52.50 --> 00:01:02.50
Lessons not gives. Yes. Yes. So, but there is one book that I have given to a few people in my life.

7
00:01:02.50 --> 00:01:18.50
And it is a book that was and still is very influential on me and especially on my perspective of leadership and really, especially in combat leadership.

8
00:01:18.50 --> 00:01:28.50
And that book is called About Face. Now, here it is right here about face. If you're listening to audio, it's an 800 over 800 page book.

9
00:01:28.50 --> 00:01:36.50
It's written by a guy named Colonel David Hackworth. Hackworth was a kind of a soldier's soldier.

10
00:01:36.50 --> 00:01:49.50
And born in 1930, joined the merchant Marines towards the end of World War II at the age of 14, had the lie to get into the merchant Marines. Got done with that gig. He joined the army just after World War II.

11
00:01:49.50 --> 00:01:53.50
He was still doing it. Sorry. What do you mean he had the lie to get into the merchant?

12
00:01:53.50 --> 00:02:01.50
So he was too young. He was 14 years old. He lied about his age to get in at 14 to the merchant Marines when he went a few years later to join the army.

13
00:02:01.50 --> 00:02:15.50
He was still too young and had to lie again to get into the army. Once he was in the army, he went over to Europe and he served directly underneath the war hardened veterans of World War II.

14
00:02:15.50 --> 00:02:24.50
And those are the guys that brought him up in the ranks and taught him about hard training.

15
00:02:24.50 --> 00:02:34.50
And really that's what they taught him. And again, that's one of those things that I look back on my military career and the Vietnam veterans that were still in the seal teams.

16
00:02:34.50 --> 00:02:45.50
When I just got in the seal teams in 1991, there were still some veterans around from Vietnam and those guys, when those guys spoke, you listened.

17
00:02:45.50 --> 00:02:54.50
Because they had some word to put out. And I absolutely listened to a lot of those lessons that those guys taught me, those of Vietnam veterans taught me. I carried on to them.

18
00:02:54.50 --> 00:03:05.50
I held on to them and took notes and passed them on in a lot of those concepts are the basis of of what we wrote about in extreme ownership.

19
00:03:05.50 --> 00:03:18.50
So he did that. He ended up getting a fighting career. So Korea was kind of his very first saw combat. He ended up getting a battlefield commission.

20
00:03:18.50 --> 00:03:26.50
And if you don't know what that means, that means you're one of the foot soldiers and all of a sudden they go look you're a good leader. We're going to put you in charge. And that's exactly what happened to him.

21
00:03:26.50 --> 00:03:31.50
He was wounded four times before the age of 21.

22
00:03:31.50 --> 00:03:42.50
So the guy was a warrior. I'm going to read his read the book dedication here from the beginning of a bout face.

23
00:03:42.50 --> 00:03:53.50
It says dedication to Steve Prasenko, who is one of the World War II combat hardened veterans that taught him how to soldier.

24
00:03:53.50 --> 00:04:06.50
He says to Steve Prasenko, who showed us how to soldier to Henry DeBoer, who showed us how to die, to glove her Johns, who showed us how to lead.

25
00:04:06.50 --> 00:04:20.50
And to all the dough boys, the ground pounders, the grunts, the American infantrymen, past, present, and especially future to them.

26
00:04:20.50 --> 00:04:35.50
So the book is dedicated. So he wrote this book obviously to pass on the lessons that he learned. And I got to make a note here in read a little section because he talks about Henry DeBoer, who showed us how to die.

27
00:04:35.50 --> 00:04:39.50
So this took place in the Korean War.

28
00:04:39.50 --> 00:04:44.50
And I'll go right into it. They're in a big firefight and here's Hackworth.

29
00:04:44.50 --> 00:04:56.50
I saw a soldier prone on the ice. He'd been there a long time. I thought he was dead, but then I saw movement and I rushed out to get him. My God, I thought it's DeBoer.

30
00:04:56.50 --> 00:05:04.50
Private Henry C DeBoer had been with George company since early in the war. He was one of the few survivors from the original third-potsoon,

31
00:05:04.50 --> 00:05:17.50
basically because in those first-hard months of combat, he had not seen even one good firefight. He had an uncanny six-sense. He could always tell when the platoon was in for a major bloodletting.

32
00:05:17.50 --> 00:05:29.50
And invariably, he'd find an excuse to be somewhere else. So here's a guy that Hackworth is saying this guy was avoiding combat, finding excuses.

33
00:05:29.50 --> 00:05:39.50
Normally, that excuse was going on sick call, which by regulation he was allowed to do, and he couldn't stop him even though you knew the only thing that was wrong with him was a chronic case of cowardice.

34
00:05:39.50 --> 00:05:46.50
So absolutely he's being called a coward. DeBoer himself even admitted he was a coward, and we hated him for it.

35
00:05:46.50 --> 00:05:57.50
He was an outcast from the platoon. We even had a little song about him, which we'd sing in Unison. Out of the dark, jury, Korean countryside comes the call of the DeBoer board.

36
00:05:57.50 --> 00:06:07.50
Sick call, sick call, sick call. He pulled this, he pulled a stunt only yesterday as we were saddling up for this very operation.

37
00:06:07.50 --> 00:06:16.50
He'd sense the bloodletting all right, but he hadn't figured that the foggy overcast covering the battlefield would not lift, and the attack would be postponed.

38
00:06:16.50 --> 00:06:31.50
He'd returned from the dock last night with a clean bill of health, most surprised to see us. The rest of the platoon took great pleasure in the fact that his malingering little ass would be in the thick of things in the morning.

39
00:06:31.50 --> 00:06:39.50
So he, there was a big operation planned, and he was supposed to go on it. He snuck out, went to sick call, said he sick.

40
00:06:39.50 --> 00:06:48.50
The operation got postponed because of whether he shows back up and hearing his inscribed.

41
00:06:48.50 --> 00:06:57.50
Now, back to the book. Now, DeBoer was ash and faced, hit in the Chester gut. I don't know there was a lot of blood, and well into shock.

42
00:06:57.50 --> 00:07:04.50
I knew he wasn't going to make it. Come on DeBoer, you're going to be fine. You'll be all right.

43
00:07:04.50 --> 00:07:12.50
I said, giving him the old pep talk, as I grabbed his jacket collar and started sliding across the ice.

44
00:07:12.50 --> 00:07:19.50
But DeBoer said, no, Sarge, just leave me. You're going to get hit. Just leave me, Sarge.

45
00:07:19.50 --> 00:07:29.50
Then suddenly he groaned, Sarge, I shipped my pants, and that was it. He was gone. I left him and ran back.

46
00:07:29.50 --> 00:07:40.50
DeBoer in death became one of the greatest heroes of our outfit. It was true he'd never been anything in his army life, but a coward.

47
00:07:40.50 --> 00:07:51.50
But he died right. He died like a man. He didn't say, take care of me. He said, leave me. Take care of yourself.

48
00:07:51.50 --> 00:07:59.50
And when I told the other guys the story, old DeBoer became a legend in the Paltoon.

49
00:07:59.50 --> 00:08:06.50
So that's the kind of thing that hack worth saw as a young leader.

50
00:08:06.50 --> 00:08:14.50
From there, he, when the Korean War ended, he was, you get highly decorated. Korean War ended, did time.

51
00:08:14.50 --> 00:08:23.50
A bunch of different units in between the Korean War and the Vietnam War kicked off. He went right into the thick of it again.

52
00:08:23.50 --> 00:08:29.50
Ended up as a battalion commander in Vietnam. And here's his list of awards.

53
00:08:29.50 --> 00:08:41.50
Two distinguished service crosses. Ten silver stars. Four legions of merit. Distinguished flying cross. Eight bronze stars. Eight purple hearts.

54
00:08:41.50 --> 00:08:59.50
So you have a guy here that is obviously a highly dedicated soldier. A guy that would do anything for the army and for America.

55
00:08:59.50 --> 00:09:19.50
But, and this is a big butt. This guy was a rebel. He was a true rebel. And he went out and went against his officers. He went against the way the army was running out of the war in Vietnam.

56
00:09:19.50 --> 00:09:30.50
And eventually, he went out in public on national television and spoke out against the Vietnam War and said that we should not fight there anymore.

57
00:09:30.50 --> 00:09:38.50
So he went on this TV program. It's called Ashe's Nanswers. It was a big show in the, in the 70s.

58
00:09:38.50 --> 00:09:49.50
And he did this interview. And again, you got to remember, this guy is an active duty, an active duty, highly decorated senior officer in the army.

59
00:09:49.50 --> 00:09:55.50
I mean, this guy is all by all count should be the most dedicated.

60
00:09:55.50 --> 00:10:01.50
And here he is, and this is what he says. You know, this is one of the quotes from this interview.

61
00:10:01.50 --> 00:10:14.50
I think that the top managers of the army and there's a big difference between a leader, a combat leader and a manager. The top managers were so involved in systems analysis in the normal bureaucracy of it all.

62
00:10:14.50 --> 00:10:22.50
They were that they were fighting from day to day just to move paper that crossed their desk and they couldn't see the force for the trees.

63
00:10:22.50 --> 00:10:33.50
In February, when we went to the Laos, we went into Laos conventionally. The idea was to block the enemies supply routes. So we dropped in there. We paid a horrible.

64
00:10:33.50 --> 00:10:42.50
The Vietnamese paid a horrible price. Tremendous mistakes were made. Again, conventional thinking.

65
00:10:42.50 --> 00:10:52.50
He's going to, he hounds on this a lot. This idea of conventional thinking. And again, you got a guy that's institutionalized me. The guy's been an in military service until he was 14 years old.

66
00:10:52.50 --> 00:11:01.50
You'd think that they would have him mentally sedated to a point where he would just think what they told him to think. But he does not.

67
00:11:01.50 --> 00:11:13.50
That's the dichotomy of this guy. Again, conventional thinking, conventional thinking, put us in that operation rather than have a light mobile gorilla force.

68
00:11:13.50 --> 00:11:25.50
But a gorilla force that belonged to the government of Vietnam or an American army operating in there, like Gorilla. So he was saying the Vietnamese should be doing this. The South Vietnamese arm is should be doing this.

69
00:11:25.50 --> 00:11:30.50
Or if we're going to do it, we need to operate like Gorilla.

70
00:11:30.50 --> 00:11:41.50
It takes a thief to catch a thief. What we need is a thief. We don't need to conventionally train FBI agent dashing through the woods with a large force behind him.

71
00:11:41.50 --> 00:11:49.50
We need small people well trained, highly motivated. And this is what we have not had.

72
00:11:49.50 --> 00:11:54.50
Because what we have now, this is where you say to yourself, wow.

73
00:11:54.50 --> 00:12:07.50
This because what we have now among the army is a bunch of shallow dilatants who run from pillar to post trying to punch their card, serving minimum time at company level because the exposure.

74
00:12:07.50 --> 00:12:13.50
You are very close to the heat of the furnace there, meaning you can get in trouble easily.

75
00:12:13.50 --> 00:12:20.50
So he is on national television, a colonel in the army, one of the most highly decorated individuals at the time.

76
00:12:20.50 --> 00:12:27.50
And he calls, he says the army is filled with a bunch of shallow dilatants who run from pillar to post trying to punch their card.

77
00:12:27.50 --> 00:12:34.50
And purposely avoiding combat. This is what that second piece means.

78
00:12:34.50 --> 00:12:42.50
You don't see this kind of behavior from army officers very often. I will tell you that.

79
00:12:42.50 --> 00:12:45.50
And here's kind of how he closed it out.

80
00:12:45.50 --> 00:12:51.50
She says, he's the interviewer. Sorry, he says the interviewer says, Colonel, do you think, do you feel it's possible?

81
00:12:51.50 --> 00:12:55.50
You have become too emotionally involved in Vietnam.

82
00:12:55.50 --> 00:13:01.50
And he says, I have become emotionally involved in Vietnam.

83
00:13:01.50 --> 00:13:06.50
One couldn't have spent the number of years I spent Vietnam without becoming emotionally involved.

84
00:13:06.50 --> 00:13:13.50
One couldn't see the number of young studs die or be terribly wounded without becoming emotionally involved.

85
00:13:13.50 --> 00:13:20.50
I just have seen the American nation spend so much of it. It's a wonderful, great young man in this country.

86
00:13:20.50 --> 00:13:28.50
I have seen our national wealth being drained away. I see the nation being split apart and almost being split a sonner because of this war.

87
00:13:28.50 --> 00:13:38.50
And I am wondering to what end it is all going to lead to.

88
00:13:38.50 --> 00:13:43.50
So that is a devastating statement.

89
00:13:43.50 --> 00:13:50.50
And when it came out, they immediately, he put in his resignation papers immediately.

90
00:13:50.50 --> 00:14:00.50
And the army started to investigate him immediately and they tried to get him in trouble for every little minor infraction that happened underneath his command at any time in any situation.

91
00:14:00.50 --> 00:14:02.50
They really tried to come after.

92
00:14:02.50 --> 00:14:09.50
And he ended up retiring.

93
00:14:09.50 --> 00:14:22.50
And I think one of the things that he expressed there is a dichotomy that anybody in a combat leadership position will feel.

94
00:14:22.50 --> 00:14:28.50
And that is, and I don't, in fact, this might be the largest dichotomy of all.

95
00:14:28.50 --> 00:14:31.50
And that's a big statement.

96
00:14:31.50 --> 00:14:49.50
And that is, as a combat leader, you are told and beyond being told, you are ingrained and beyond being ingrained.

97
00:14:49.50 --> 00:14:55.50
You are inherently inherently caring of your guys.

98
00:14:55.50 --> 00:15:02.50
There is no one more important than your guys.

99
00:15:02.50 --> 00:15:10.50
And the dichotomy is, as much as you care about these guys, and you love these guys, and you do anything for them.

100
00:15:10.50 --> 00:15:24.50
But that being said, it is your job to send these guys on operations that can kill them.

101
00:15:24.50 --> 00:15:29.50
So that is a huge dichotomy.

102
00:15:29.50 --> 00:15:37.50
And I think that's one of the things that hack worth when he saw it on a grand scale, because he could deal with it in his own groups.

103
00:15:37.50 --> 00:15:45.50
But when he saw it on a grand scale, you know, young men being sent to their death.

104
00:15:45.50 --> 00:15:53.50
It's, it's, I think, what turned him.

105
00:15:53.50 --> 00:15:59.50
So he ended up after this.

106
00:15:59.50 --> 00:16:03.50
You know, he kind of continued down that path, and he moved out of America.

107
00:16:03.50 --> 00:16:05.50
He moved to Australia.

108
00:16:05.50 --> 00:16:16.50
And he ended up kind of playing a big role in the anti-nuclear weapons movement.

109
00:16:16.50 --> 00:16:19.50
And I mean, that's kind of where he went.

110
00:16:19.50 --> 00:16:26.50
So I, you know, hack was a complex person, hack worth.

111
00:16:26.50 --> 00:16:31.50
That's kind of his nickname, everyone calls him hack hack was a complex person.

112
00:16:31.50 --> 00:16:34.50
And I don't agree with everything that he says.

113
00:16:34.50 --> 00:16:36.50
I don't agree with everything that he does.

114
00:16:36.50 --> 00:16:41.50
And why everything that he did, I don't worship the guy.

115
00:16:41.50 --> 00:16:46.50
And you know, what's interesting about me questioning what his decisions and questioning his leadership is like,

116
00:16:46.50 --> 00:16:51.50
that's something I learned from him. Like, don't even, don't listen to anybody 100%.

117
00:16:51.50 --> 00:17:00.50
You know, you should always be questioning what people are saying and making sure and confirming it through other sources and other experiences that it's the right thing to do.

118
00:17:00.50 --> 00:17:07.50
And that's something that I always try to do with everything is, is use that attitude.

119
00:17:07.50 --> 00:17:13.50
And so I, I, I don't, I don't recall.

120
00:17:13.50 --> 00:17:18.50
I was actually trying to come in here tonight. I was trying to figure out when I got this book.

121
00:17:18.50 --> 00:17:23.50
And I actually have no idea. I don't remember it. It wasn't appeared in my life at some point.

122
00:17:23.50 --> 00:17:28.50
And I don't know how it don't never made the recommendation to me. I just somehow ended up with it.

123
00:17:28.50 --> 00:17:31.50
And, but I got it.

124
00:17:31.50 --> 00:17:36.50
I got it before, one thing I do was I got it before September 11, 2001.

125
00:17:36.50 --> 00:17:41.50
When that happened, I had already read it. I had it in my brain.

126
00:17:41.50 --> 00:17:54.50
But when I was in Ramadi in 2006, this, I, I literally read this book every night that I was not out in the field.

127
00:17:54.50 --> 00:17:56.50
I read this book every night.

128
00:17:56.50 --> 00:18:02.50
And, you know, I just opened it up. You could open up anywhere in that, in this book, and you could find something.

129
00:18:02.50 --> 00:18:10.50
Some, some piece of information, some similar situations, some less and learned that you could take from it.

130
00:18:10.50 --> 00:18:18.50
And it could guide you. And, and you know, one of the, like, like, for instance, and it all applied to what I was doing. The situation I was in.

131
00:18:18.50 --> 00:18:33.50
So, for instance, we were in Iraq and we were supposed to be working with Iraqi soldiers who are unmotivated, poorly equipped, poorly trained, uneducated, bad morale.

132
00:18:33.50 --> 00:18:39.50
And that's, and corrupt. So, there, the money is all disappearing. It's, it's a horrible situation.

133
00:18:39.50 --> 00:18:50.50
And, and what was hackworth doing Vietnam, well, they were working with the South Vietnamese Army. Who was corrupt and unmotivated, and poorly trained, and all those same things.

134
00:18:50.50 --> 00:18:55.50
So, they were dealing with the same things we were doing. And that's one example of many.

135
00:18:55.50 --> 00:19:04.50
Uh, I took a little break about three months into deployment. I took a little break, and I'm not 100% sure why.

136
00:19:04.50 --> 00:19:16.50
But I found another book. Somebody had left the book in our building. And the book was, speaking of dichotomy, the book was the electric cool aid asset test by Tom Wolf.

137
00:19:16.50 --> 00:19:27.50
And I think at this point, I, you know, three months into deployment, I think I needed some kind of mental escape, you know, at least, you know, I was, I was like dealing with combat all day.

138
00:19:27.50 --> 00:19:35.50
And then I'd go in my room and read about combat at night. And I kind of was like, okay, you need to think about something else for 20 minutes or 10 minutes.

139
00:19:35.50 --> 00:19:44.50
It just get out of it. Get it out of your head. And I randomly found this book. So I said, and I had read the right stuff by Tom Wolf, which was a fantastic book.

140
00:19:44.50 --> 00:19:50.50
And so I said, oh, this, I'm sure this will be interesting as well. So as I read this book,

141
00:19:50.50 --> 00:20:01.50
the electric cool aid asset test, which is about hippies and drugs and the 60s, and that's what it's about hate Ashbury, the whole nine yards.

142
00:20:01.50 --> 00:20:11.50
And there's a quote in the middle that I actually pulled out because I will never forget this quote. And how this quote was so starkly contrasting with about face.

143
00:20:11.50 --> 00:20:25.50
And I'm going to read this quote. And I kind of forget the whole set up to it, but there are at some kind of a concert. And there's all the screaming and craziness going on at some rock and roll concert.

144
00:20:25.50 --> 00:20:32.50
And, you know, he says, I couldn't hear what they were screaming either, but you don't have to.

145
00:20:32.50 --> 00:20:44.50
They're screaming me, me, me, me, me. I'm me. That's the cry of the ego. And that's the cry of this rally. It's concert.

146
00:20:44.50 --> 00:20:58.50
Me, me, me, me. And that's why wars get fought ego because enough people want to scream, pay attention to me.

147
00:20:58.50 --> 00:21:13.50
And it was one of those things that I read and it was so starkly different from the situation that I was in where I was with these guys in my own task, you know, the seals in my task unit, the marines that were there on the ground with us, the army soldiers that were down on the ground with us.

148
00:21:13.50 --> 00:21:22.50
And these guys were all so selfless. The last thing they cared in the world about was me, me, me, me.

149
00:21:22.50 --> 00:21:35.50
And I got done with that book and I went right back to about face because I related to it. I understood and I said to myself, this is true. This is selfless. This is where I'm at right now.

150
00:21:35.50 --> 00:21:36.50
Yeah.

151
00:21:36.50 --> 00:21:49.50
So I went back into about face and I continued and eventually this book is the one book that I've given to a few of the guys that worked closely for me.

152
00:21:49.50 --> 00:22:03.50
Include and included in life, life-babbin who, you know, one of my brothers who wrote extreme ownership with me and he's one of the guys that, you know, he's got his got his copy and it's all doggy or it's marked up because it's a great book.

153
00:22:03.50 --> 00:22:16.50
So obviously when we like on Twitter and Facebook and we asked for people to give us questions. A lot of the questions are about

154
00:22:16.50 --> 00:22:25.50
leadership and so I kind of as I thought about diving in a little bit to

155
00:22:25.50 --> 00:22:38.50
to this book and and talk about a little bit of course you could spend, you know, we could do 50 episodes, 10 hours each on this book.

156
00:22:38.50 --> 00:22:41.50
So it's so dense and filled with information not to mention 800 page.

157
00:22:41.50 --> 00:22:50.50
Yeah. There's um, but I wanted to I wanted to go a little bit deep on this one situation where

158
00:22:50.50 --> 00:23:01.50
David Hacworth, Colonel Hacworth, had now gone into Vietnam and there was a battalion of soldiers and they were kind of a disaster.

159
00:23:01.50 --> 00:23:11.50
And it was kind of the standard of like what what had happened with some of the poor leadership in Vietnam and he took over.

160
00:23:11.50 --> 00:23:19.50
And again, just to kind of to kind of lay out what Hacworth was like, here's a quote that kind of starts off the chapter.

161
00:23:19.50 --> 00:23:22.50
Hacworth was essentially a legend.

162
00:23:22.50 --> 00:23:36.50
Just before he arrived, I recall going to the G1 and asking who the new Battalion commander was going to be. The deputy G1 said, can't tell you, you know how personal people are.

163
00:23:36.50 --> 00:23:38.50
They like to hit pocket everything.

164
00:23:38.50 --> 00:23:41.50
But he's Mr. infantry.

165
00:23:41.50 --> 00:23:44.50
I thought who the hell is Mr. infantry?

166
00:23:44.50 --> 00:23:54.50
Of course, I'd read about David Hacworth. So his kind of nickname was Mr. infantry. That was what is reputation. What does hit pocket mean?

167
00:23:54.50 --> 00:24:03.50
Meaning if people had a charge of personnel and moving people around inside the military, they know they know little bits of information.

168
00:24:03.50 --> 00:24:08.50
And instead of giving it to you, they keep it close to keep it in their pocket. That's all means.

169
00:24:08.50 --> 00:24:18.50
And then to kind of explain though that, you know, there's some people that go, yeah, this guy is a great leader. He's coming in.

170
00:24:18.50 --> 00:24:23.50
But to kind of show you what the attitude of the troops is.

171
00:24:23.50 --> 00:24:30.50
You can't remember this is Vietnam. We got drafties. We got hippies. We got all kinds of anti-American. I mean, it's crazy times.

172
00:24:30.50 --> 00:24:40.50
Doc Holly, this is another quote, who's it from a medic, Charles Windsor. Doc Holly and I were sitting in the aid station drinking beer and saying,

173
00:24:40.50 --> 00:24:46.50
God, this is going to be hell. We've got some GI Joe life around here who's going to just ruin us.

174
00:24:46.50 --> 00:24:52.50
That was probably the lowest point in morale in the battalion. Not only had we been taking a lot of casualties,

175
00:24:52.50 --> 00:24:58.50
but now it looked as if someone was going to come in and kick ass and make career soldiers out of us.

176
00:24:58.50 --> 00:25:04.50
And it goes on to go through more quotes where they actually talk about a price on his head.

177
00:25:04.50 --> 00:25:14.50
The soldiers talk about, hey, we need to kill this guy before he gets us killed, which is just kind of crazy.

178
00:25:14.50 --> 00:25:22.50
Yeah, that's right. You know, you hear about that. You hear about that Vietnam, this idea of, it's called Fragging.

179
00:25:22.50 --> 00:25:30.50
There's a name for it. They were going to frag our officer means we're going to kill our own officer. And it's something that definitely happened.

180
00:25:30.50 --> 00:25:38.50
And it's a, this is a perfect case of where people talked about it possibly happening.

181
00:25:38.50 --> 00:25:50.50
So to get into this chapter a little bit, here's Hackworth talking about when he took over.

182
00:25:50.50 --> 00:25:56.50
There was no sense in showing this sorry outfit. I was in the state of shock.

183
00:25:56.50 --> 00:26:02.50
It wasn't just the command post group that it wasn't just that the command post group slept on

184
00:26:02.50 --> 00:26:08.50
Cots inside tents that they had folding chairs and state side foot lockers, portable radios,

185
00:26:08.50 --> 00:26:14.50
and plastic coolers filled with beer and coke at their fire base out in the field.

186
00:26:14.50 --> 00:26:22.50
More than that, it was that they had portable toilets too. So here he is. These guys are supposed to be out in the field.

187
00:26:22.50 --> 00:26:28.50
And they have all this luxury. And that's something that we saw in Iraq where

188
00:26:28.50 --> 00:26:38.50
there was certain bases where they had Starbucks and subway sandwiches and McDonald's literally had those things.

189
00:26:38.50 --> 00:26:44.50
And you could defer to the you go out into the fray, you get guys I've ever visited some of my first

190
00:26:44.50 --> 00:26:50.50
deployments to Iraq. We go out to some of the big guys, you know, completely in the bush living like

191
00:26:50.50 --> 00:26:54.50
just barely scraping by on one MRE a day.

192
00:26:54.50 --> 00:27:00.50
So, now he's talking about the command post and he says that the command post

193
00:27:00.50 --> 00:27:06.50
apparently were blissfully unaware that just nearby their troops were crapping on the ground

194
00:27:06.50 --> 00:27:12.50
and not even covering it up. So you have complete just disaster situation going on here.

195
00:27:12.50 --> 00:27:18.50
And then the general, that's in charge of all these battalions, as he's about to put

196
00:27:18.50 --> 00:27:24.50
hack worth in charge, guy named General U.L. says, it's a pussy battalion.

197
00:27:24.50 --> 00:27:30.50
And I want tigers, not pussy's. But he'd gotten it wrong.

198
00:27:30.50 --> 00:27:36.50
With the fourth battalion, 39th and 39th infantry, that's where he's taken over. It was not a

199
00:27:36.50 --> 00:27:42.50
question of feline degree. As far as I could see, this unit was not even a military organization.

200
00:27:42.50 --> 00:27:46.50
So that's that's what this guy walked into. Come on.

201
00:27:46.50 --> 00:27:52.50
It was total, he goes on to say, it was total disintegration.

202
00:27:52.50 --> 00:27:58.50
Throughout the fire base, a mud amid the shit and toilet paper and the machine gun ammo laying in the mud

203
00:27:58.50 --> 00:28:02.50
were troops who were love beads and peace symbols and looked more like something out of hate

204
00:28:02.50 --> 00:28:08.50
ashberry than soldiers in the US Army. All were low on spirit and a few were high, openly

205
00:28:08.50 --> 00:28:14.50
on marijuana. There was minimum security. Few men carried are cared for their weapons.

206
00:28:14.50 --> 00:28:18.50
Most had let them go red with rust as they stroll around without them.

207
00:28:18.50 --> 00:28:23.50
Grenades weren't taped. And when a unit moved out, most of the gunners were their ammo

208
00:28:23.50 --> 00:28:29.50
ponte of viestile. The ideal way to guarantee a weapon jam sometime down the track when dirty

209
00:28:29.50 --> 00:28:39.50
dented cartridges were inserted into their M60s. So what we have here is a total lack of discipline.

210
00:28:39.50 --> 00:28:47.50
And another thing that this reminded me of was I was always trying to, when I was in the

211
00:28:47.50 --> 00:28:53.50
train of pull as much information about war as I could. And one of the recent wars and recent

212
00:28:53.50 --> 00:28:59.50
times was when the Russians went into Chechnya the first time and they had a really hard time.

213
00:28:59.50 --> 00:29:05.50
And I read the after actions reports from the Russian officers that had taken troops there.

214
00:29:05.50 --> 00:29:11.50
And one of the ones that I remembered, I've looked for it to try and find it again. I don't know if it's

215
00:29:11.50 --> 00:29:19.50
not a war at went. But I haven't been able to find it. But the guy basically says, it all started

216
00:29:19.50 --> 00:29:23.50
when the guy stopped shaving. And when they stopped shaving, then the next thing you do that

217
00:29:23.50 --> 00:29:29.50
weren't clean their guns, then the next thing you knew, they weren't staying

218
00:29:29.50 --> 00:29:35.50
aware while they were on watch and the next thing you know, they were getting overrun and killed.

219
00:29:35.50 --> 00:29:44.70
So those little things, those little things that you do write all the time are important.

220
00:29:44.70 --> 00:29:50.70
And that's the same thing with you and with me and with our lives. It's those little things.

221
00:29:51.66 --> 00:29:54.30
Those little disciplines, those little daily disciplines.

222
00:29:54.30 --> 00:29:59.82
Little cycle of like you waking up at 4.30 in the morning, like me, like as a ritual, you know,

223
00:30:00.46 --> 00:30:04.06
that's one of them. You know, I tried to do something physically active every day.

224
00:30:04.06 --> 00:30:06.78
That's another thing. When you lose that discipline, what goes next?

225
00:30:07.42 --> 00:30:11.74
The next thing on the list, really. And then the next thing, you know, you're sleeping

226
00:30:11.74 --> 00:30:14.94
in until nine, you're knocking your workout and things are going horribly backwards.

227
00:30:16.14 --> 00:30:22.06
But it's those little disciplines. And whenever I feel myself to slip, I always think of this.

228
00:30:22.06 --> 00:30:26.38
I always think of the fact that there's these little disciplines that mean so much.

229
00:30:26.94 --> 00:30:28.06
And they build on each other.

230
00:30:28.06 --> 00:30:34.62
The interesting is I didn't really look at it that way ever and that makes complete sense.

231
00:30:34.62 --> 00:30:39.74
Where, yeah, you let the little things slide and slowly by slowly, those things that you let

232
00:30:39.74 --> 00:30:45.66
slide start getting bigger and bigger. I always thought of it where I remember hearing

233
00:30:46.94 --> 00:30:52.70
somebody say, if you can't make your bed, right? Right. Then how do you expect to run a company?

234
00:30:52.70 --> 00:30:55.58
I think it was. How do you expect to be the boss of a company?

235
00:30:55.58 --> 00:31:01.58
Yeah. And I remember thinking, well, unless your company is a bedmaking company, that has nothing

236
00:31:01.58 --> 00:31:06.14
to do with it. And this is also a little bit counter to something I've heard recently when they talk

237
00:31:06.14 --> 00:31:08.86
about, have you heard this decision fatigue? Have you heard that?

238
00:31:09.58 --> 00:31:16.14
So it's basically this theory where every decision you make takes some sort of toll on you mentally.

239
00:31:16.14 --> 00:31:23.26
Yes. And so you should not fatigue your decisions. You should only should save your decisions

240
00:31:23.26 --> 00:31:28.94
for important things. So for instance, is that kind of like if you're with a group of people and

241
00:31:28.94 --> 00:31:34.70
once one guy says, hey, where do you guys want to eat? And everyone says, oh, I don't care where do you

242
00:31:34.70 --> 00:31:38.94
want to eat? It's different. Not the same thing. It will be the same thing. Maybe a way, lower level.

243
00:31:38.94 --> 00:31:42.62
But the level of this, when I heard about the decision fatigue, the level that I heard this on was,

244
00:31:44.62 --> 00:31:49.98
like, every day, you know, you shouldn't think about what you're going to wear that day.

245
00:31:49.98 --> 00:31:53.66
You should have your clothes ready because if you wake up, you have to think, oh, do I wear the

246
00:31:53.66 --> 00:31:57.42
blue shirt or the white shirt and then it becomes a decision? And then you decide, oh, what am I

247
00:31:57.42 --> 00:32:00.78
going to have for breakfast? May I have this? And each one of these decisions chip away.

248
00:32:01.98 --> 00:32:08.38
Now, that's fine. I don't really, I don't know if I believe that 100%, but one thing I do think is the

249
00:32:08.38 --> 00:32:16.14
opposite is I think that the smaller disciplines instill and create stronger disciplines. So the

250
00:32:16.14 --> 00:32:22.46
waking up early, the making of the bed, the checking off your list, all those little things that you do.

251
00:32:22.46 --> 00:32:27.58
I think increased discipline. I know what, when I fall off the discipline wagon for whatever

252
00:32:27.58 --> 00:32:33.98
reason, it's like a train. You know, I'm like, oh, God, what just happened, I'm all of a sudden,

253
00:32:33.98 --> 00:32:39.26
my room is a mess and my, it just goes downhill in three days and two days and I go, oh my god,

254
00:32:39.26 --> 00:32:44.38
get back in the game. So, and then as soon as I get back in the game, I implement those smaller

255
00:32:44.38 --> 00:32:48.54
disciplines, boom, we're back in the game and the bigger disciplines fall in the place.

256
00:32:51.58 --> 00:33:06.62
So, continue. Now, there was a general that had swung through Vietnam. General James will know

257
00:33:06.62 --> 00:33:15.18
and he observed and this is going to the book. General James will know observed and wrote to the

258
00:33:15.18 --> 00:33:20.54
chief of staff, Westmoreland. We all knew that is less than a month before. So before this

259
00:33:20.54 --> 00:33:26.38
he had showed up before hack worth had showed up. This guy, General James will know

260
00:33:27.10 --> 00:33:32.14
had observed and wrote to chief of staff, Westmoreland, less than a month before during his

261
00:33:32.14 --> 00:33:40.70
whirlwind, nine day trip to the war zone. We'll know told the chief that the most, the almost

262
00:33:40.70 --> 00:33:46.06
universal opinion among those he'd spoken with was that the young officers and enlisted men

263
00:33:46.06 --> 00:33:53.26
being sent to Vietnam were indeed properly trained, prepared for combat, both by training and

264
00:33:53.26 --> 00:33:59.82
mental conditioning. So this guy wrote this flowery report. After he goes, it goes to Vietnam for

265
00:33:59.82 --> 00:34:04.54
nine days and you can imagine somebody like hack worth that spent five years in Vietnam. Somebody

266
00:34:04.54 --> 00:34:10.14
shows up, spends nine days there. He's looking at this guy like he's an idiot. And this is a classic

267
00:34:12.46 --> 00:34:18.22
statement about leadership. He said, this is hack worth going directly to the book again.

268
00:34:18.22 --> 00:34:26.30
What a mistake it was to listen to the generals of corporate HQ who were briefed only in zero

269
00:34:26.30 --> 00:34:34.86
defect terms and so far from the cutting edge expected nothing less. It was among the biggest mistakes

270
00:34:34.86 --> 00:34:41.58
of the war. The politicians only listen to these generals and these generals to themselves.

271
00:34:43.90 --> 00:34:49.42
That's that's crazy. And this is again when I was talking about questioning earlier and

272
00:34:49.42 --> 00:34:53.42
I like I question hack worth and I question to everybody and everything I'm constantly asking

273
00:34:53.42 --> 00:34:57.42
those questions because you don't know you don't know if you're just listening to the generals

274
00:34:57.42 --> 00:35:03.42
that only listening to themselves back to the book. Few people asked the frontline soldiers.

275
00:35:03.42 --> 00:35:11.02
The only ones who really knew. So you got to talk to your frontline troops. Yeah.

276
00:35:11.02 --> 00:35:19.66
That's just a mandatory piece of leadership. I liked I had a great word on this. It's called

277
00:35:19.66 --> 00:35:26.86
incestual knowledge. Right. When the when this little group just talks among themselves and they

278
00:35:26.86 --> 00:35:30.78
believe everything that they hear and they agree with everything they hear. And you know where

279
00:35:30.78 --> 00:35:36.38
you see this? We see this and we saw it with mixed martial arts because you saw guys that got so

280
00:35:36.38 --> 00:35:44.06
into their own little thing with no outside influence that when they all believe their own

281
00:35:44.06 --> 00:35:50.94
crap. Yeah. And you get to can be too fully. It can be that way. And you got to have an open mind

282
00:35:50.94 --> 00:35:57.10
with everything. You know and definitely you get to use one of the things you got to have an open

283
00:35:57.10 --> 00:36:02.70
mind with and see what other people are doing and how are they doing it. And that's the miracle

284
00:36:02.70 --> 00:36:07.74
these days as you can be seeing getting all this influence from the internet. There's all these different

285
00:36:07.74 --> 00:36:12.46
people out there and showing how they're doing it and it's a whole new world. But you got to have

286
00:36:12.46 --> 00:36:16.62
an open mind. If you haven't don't have an open mind and all you do is incest you as Lee

287
00:36:17.58 --> 00:36:27.02
converse with other people that believe the same thing as you you're wrong. And this is crazy.

288
00:36:27.58 --> 00:36:34.14
This is this is again. This is what will know says what is left and he's talking about the

289
00:36:34.14 --> 00:36:40.54
this Vietnam. What is left appears to be a mopping up operation? I do not believe that in the

290
00:36:40.54 --> 00:36:47.18
current situation the enemy has the capability to more than harass us. I did not find a division

291
00:36:47.18 --> 00:36:52.14
commander who disagreed with this conclusion with respect to his own tactical area of operation.

292
00:36:52.14 --> 00:36:58.38
This is 1968. And this general comes back saying hey the enemy can't do anything better as us.

293
00:37:00.38 --> 00:37:06.30
And that's this guy was the ranking guy going back and reporting to West Moreland in charge

294
00:37:06.30 --> 00:37:16.62
the whole army. Crazy, crazy that this could be taking place. As we go a little bit deeper into this,

295
00:37:16.62 --> 00:37:25.66
they had a board that explained is like a scoreboard for how many VC, Vietcong, how many of them

296
00:37:25.66 --> 00:37:32.06
had been killed or wounded and how many Americans had been killed or wounded. And when he took over

297
00:37:32.06 --> 00:37:40.06
when when Hackworth took over the enemy had zero Ka. So that there've been zero enemy killed,

298
00:37:40.06 --> 00:37:47.10
zero enemy wounded and zero enemy captured. Meanwhile, the Americans had at 24 killed and

299
00:37:47.10 --> 00:37:56.62
485 wounded. So did you hear what I just said? I did. So the enemy had zero killed,

300
00:37:56.62 --> 00:38:03.66
zero wounded, zero captured and yet we had lost 24 Americans killed and 485 wounded.

301
00:38:04.46 --> 00:38:08.54
This goes back to what I was talking about where I would see these similarities in Iraq

302
00:38:09.82 --> 00:38:16.38
to Vietnam because these wounded came from rockets, mortars, booby traps, friendly fire.

303
00:38:18.06 --> 00:38:20.78
Rockets, mortars, booby traps, and friendly fires. I think

304
00:38:20.78 --> 00:38:28.78
70% of the casualties in Iraq were from IEDs, which an IED is an improvised explosive device.

305
00:38:28.78 --> 00:38:33.10
That's a booby trap. You know, the other big percentage was from getting mortared. You know,

306
00:38:33.10 --> 00:38:37.10
where you're sitting inside your firebase and all of a sudden bombs start raining down from the sky.

307
00:38:39.02 --> 00:38:42.30
And it's weird too. Like this is something that we talk about often. It's something that

308
00:38:42.30 --> 00:38:50.38
that Hackworth talked about as well. If you ever heard someone say, in Vietnam, we won every major

309
00:38:50.38 --> 00:38:56.78
battle, but we just lost the one we've heard that. It's a statement that people make.

310
00:38:57.74 --> 00:39:03.90
And as I started to analyze that, because when I was younger, I was like, yeah, that's right,

311
00:39:03.90 --> 00:39:07.74
because we're the best military in the world. We would never lose to these guys. We're awesome.

312
00:39:07.74 --> 00:39:13.82
And we are awesome. We are the best military in the world. But if I have a platoon of, you know,

313
00:39:13.82 --> 00:39:22.14
40 guys in the army. And we lose a guy to a booby trap. And we lose a guy to a mortar.

314
00:39:23.02 --> 00:39:30.54
And we never confront the enemy. Who's going to win the war? It's not us. So that was a very

315
00:39:34.54 --> 00:39:41.10
very disturbing. And we did see some of this. We did see some of this in Iraq, where things

316
00:39:41.10 --> 00:39:46.06
would get sugar coated. And that's one thing I'd go back to the book. And I'd say, why are they

317
00:39:46.06 --> 00:39:50.06
sugar coating this? What's going on? Somebody needs to speak the truth. We need to tell them what's

318
00:39:50.06 --> 00:39:55.82
really going on here. Hey, I raised my hand and say, no, boss, it's not like that. We need this.

319
00:39:55.82 --> 00:39:59.90
We need, this is where we're going to lose. So what's going wrong? And luckily, we had some very

320
00:39:59.90 --> 00:40:07.50
strong, military leaders that did that, you know, Petraias, for sure, who kind of implemented the

321
00:40:07.50 --> 00:40:16.06
surge. We had Mick Master who I talk about a lot, HR Mick Master up and up in Northern Iraq.

322
00:40:16.06 --> 00:40:20.54
And, you know, the guy that I worked directly for, Colonel Sean McFarland, who's now in general.

323
00:40:21.58 --> 00:40:25.42
Those guys were guys that spoke the truth. And I would hear, I heard Mick Farland do that. I would hear

324
00:40:25.42 --> 00:40:29.98
that guy say, no, actually we can't do that. No, that's actually the wrong idea. No, we actually

325
00:40:29.98 --> 00:40:33.42
need to engage with these tribal leaders, even though they were criminals six months ago. No,

326
00:40:33.42 --> 00:40:39.58
this is what we need to do. So I got to see some of that leadership step up, which was awesome.

327
00:40:46.06 --> 00:40:55.10
He goes on to talk about how I got to read this. So he goes, what's called a change of command,

328
00:40:55.10 --> 00:40:59.90
which is when, you know, I'm in charge, but I'm going to give you the Battalion. So the following

329
00:40:59.90 --> 00:41:04.86
day I took over the Battalion from Lieutenant Colonel Franklin A. Hart in a parade field,

330
00:41:04.86 --> 00:41:09.74
change a command in the middle of the Macong Delta. What kind of war have I gotten myself into?

331
00:41:09.74 --> 00:41:15.42
I wondered, a perfectly starched general U.S. there, having flown in for the occasion in his

332
00:41:15.42 --> 00:41:20.86
polished choppers. There were other brass too, and photographers, the American flag, but the

333
00:41:20.86 --> 00:41:27.50
Battalion colors, which were ceremoniously passed on to me. And all of this before the scrimmiest,

334
00:41:27.50 --> 00:41:33.42
most spiritless assembly of soldiers I'd ever seen. Incredibly, none of the generals are

335
00:41:33.42 --> 00:41:37.10
Colonel seemed to notice the slack condition of my new charges or their positions.

336
00:41:40.94 --> 00:41:46.22
Lieutenant Colonel Frank Hart would still receive a legion of merit for his job well done with

337
00:41:46.22 --> 00:41:51.42
the Battalion. So picture that in your mind, you're taking over this Battalion. These guys are just

338
00:41:51.42 --> 00:41:58.78
complete disaster. The general show up in their polished helicopters wearing starched uniforms,

339
00:41:58.78 --> 00:42:02.54
and they don't even, they just ignore. It's like they're like, got blinders on. They're just ignoring

340
00:42:02.54 --> 00:42:12.06
the fact that these guys are just a total disaster. Crazy thoughts. Crazy thoughts. So

341
00:42:12.06 --> 00:42:23.90
then we get into the point where, and this is where, when we get these questions on Twitter

342
00:42:23.90 --> 00:42:30.78
about leadership, and this is sort of what drew me back to thinking about talking about this book.

343
00:42:31.58 --> 00:42:39.34
It was because as we get these questions, you end up with a, with just really great examples.

344
00:42:39.34 --> 00:42:46.06
And a lot of the questions that we get are, what do you do with people that are on motivated? What

345
00:42:46.06 --> 00:42:49.98
do you do when, and everyone has that question of what do you do when people are motivated?

346
00:42:50.86 --> 00:42:57.18
And I'll tell you, can you imagine if there's anyone less motivated than a

347
00:42:57.18 --> 00:43:08.94
you know, constriptor, a draftee from Vietnam, from the Vietnam War? It's, it's kind of crazy.

348
00:43:13.26 --> 00:43:19.10
Sorry, go ahead. Yeah, no problem. One of the things that HAC says is,

349
00:43:19.10 --> 00:43:23.90
little could I have guessed that whipping, it indeshape, meaning the Battalion, what are

350
00:43:23.90 --> 00:43:29.42
require every little bit of knowledge I'd gained in, in the interim. So his whole career, he

351
00:43:29.42 --> 00:43:33.42
realized this whole career is now to take every trick that he'd learned to get these guys in the shape.

352
00:43:33.42 --> 00:43:37.58
Now, what's interesting about this is he says whipping these guys in the shape. And this is

353
00:43:37.58 --> 00:43:44.78
something I've had, I've had executives when I get on with the CEO and he'll say,

354
00:43:44.78 --> 00:43:50.14
I need you to come in here and whip my guys in the shape. And it's always, it's one of those quotes

355
00:43:50.14 --> 00:43:53.90
that I have to push back on because they think I'm going to come in there like a drill instructor

356
00:43:53.90 --> 00:43:58.86
and park or there's a people who are going to, and it just doesn't work that way. And you know,

357
00:43:58.86 --> 00:44:08.78
you have to do more than that. So when one of the initial things that he did

358
00:44:08.78 --> 00:44:19.50
was institute discipline. And as you know, discipline is one of my favorite words.

359
00:44:21.74 --> 00:44:28.78
Going back to the book here, from the outset, I realized that to make this unit an effective military

360
00:44:28.78 --> 00:44:33.90
force, I'd have to implement about a thousand changes. So I figured we'd start with five

361
00:44:33.90 --> 00:44:41.02
a day, little things, basic things like where your steel pot helmet and clean and carry your rifle

362
00:44:41.02 --> 00:44:48.94
at all times. And ammunition will not be worn poncho viste. My first order was that come darkness

363
00:44:48.94 --> 00:44:55.98
the fire support base perimeter would pull back 300 meters. The troops instantly began to grumble

364
00:44:55.98 --> 00:45:02.46
at this, but at the next order, but it was the next order that really began the muteness feeling

365
00:45:02.46 --> 00:45:10.38
within my hard luck outfit. Anything you can't carry 24 hours a day is gone on the next chopper.

366
00:45:10.38 --> 00:45:15.26
So here are these guys that were living in tents that had toilets out there, radios and all the

367
00:45:15.26 --> 00:45:20.62
stuff. And he said anything you can't carry with you. Use going is out of here. That's hard

368
00:45:20.62 --> 00:45:31.26
core discipline. And they piled it all up in the middle of the the middle of the base and had a big

369
00:45:31.26 --> 00:45:36.46
helicopter come in and take it out. Now one thing he says here is he says, I wasn't there to have

370
00:45:36.46 --> 00:45:45.66
them like me. And this is one of those dichotomies where, and I'm sure everybody at one point or

371
00:45:45.66 --> 00:45:57.02
another who has worked for someone that is very abrasive and thinks they can just throw orders around

372
00:45:57.02 --> 00:46:03.90
and no one likes working for that guy. It's awful. And so there's a fine line between listen,

373
00:46:03.90 --> 00:46:09.26
I'm not here to make friends. And oh, I'm just going to be totally abrasive and treat everyone

374
00:46:09.26 --> 00:46:14.70
like crap because you're not going to get people to follow you with that attitude. So he obviously

375
00:46:14.70 --> 00:46:21.26
was very good at walking that fine line between pushing hard enough where he's like, hey, I'm not

376
00:46:21.26 --> 00:46:26.14
here to make friends, but at the same time, not pushing him so hard that he's getting shot or there's

377
00:46:26.14 --> 00:46:33.02
a complete mute knee against him. Yeah, you would think that someone who, who, it my experience when

378
00:46:33.82 --> 00:46:39.10
people say that, I'm not here to make friends, you know, I'm here to whatever. It's usually

379
00:46:39.10 --> 00:46:45.74
kind of like an excuse because they piss somebody off. Yeah. So I think that to really use that in an

380
00:46:45.74 --> 00:46:52.62
in an accurate way or in a conducive way, I'm not here to make friends, is if you can show them results

381
00:46:53.34 --> 00:46:58.62
and at the same time not necessarily, you know, be the nicest of guys. Then I think that's when

382
00:46:58.62 --> 00:47:05.26
you start to walk that fine line. So it's beautiful that you said that. So this goes right into the

383
00:47:05.26 --> 00:47:11.98
fact that a short time later. So after they pulled back this perimeter, so every night instead

384
00:47:11.98 --> 00:47:16.30
of staying where they were just all relaxed, they packed up, they pulled back, they dug in.

385
00:47:16.30 --> 00:47:21.26
A short time later, we were hit with a barrage of rocket and recorrelous rifle fire, but most

386
00:47:21.26 --> 00:47:28.06
of it fell on the old positions when I got on the horn and called for artillery, I was surprised

387
00:47:28.06 --> 00:47:32.38
I was very nervous. Command is not like hopping back onto a bicycle and after two and a half

388
00:47:32.38 --> 00:47:38.22
years away from it, I was rusty and actually scared I'd screw up. But then I heard a guy, later

389
00:47:38.22 --> 00:47:44.78
do I be identified as Lieutenant Larry Taller who worked in the S3 section, running behind me to his

390
00:47:44.78 --> 00:47:50.54
defense position. And here's the quote from this guy. He's a mean son of a bitch, but he knows

391
00:47:50.54 --> 00:48:02.62
what he's doing. So that's exactly what you just said. And that's exactly what affected had.

392
00:48:03.66 --> 00:48:10.62
Moving through this, the men and now we're talking about this unit, the four three nine,

393
00:48:10.62 --> 00:48:17.02
the men of the four three nine had no unit identity and no pride in themselves. So for all those

394
00:48:17.02 --> 00:48:20.62
people that are out there that have sent me Twitter questions and hey, how do I deal with people

395
00:48:20.62 --> 00:48:24.86
that are unmotivated? How do I change? That's another one. How does culture change?

396
00:48:27.26 --> 00:48:32.54
He's going to go into that. As a first step toward rectifying this, I decided to call my hard

397
00:48:32.54 --> 00:48:41.02
luck battalion the hard core and the troops, Rekondos. So he's renaming them. He's renaming,

398
00:48:41.02 --> 00:48:46.30
renaming the battalion. And I actually did this very thing when I was a task unit commander,

399
00:48:46.30 --> 00:48:52.22
when I took over a task unit, so task units in a seal team, they have a phonetic letter for their

400
00:48:52.22 --> 00:48:57.66
name. So there's out task unit alpha, task unit bravo, task unit Charlie, and then you've got

401
00:48:57.66 --> 00:49:03.58
the platoon underneath them. So what I did with ours is basically as soon as I took it over,

402
00:49:03.58 --> 00:49:08.78
I said, hey, we were task unit bravo, B, and I said, guys, we're not task unit bravo,

403
00:49:08.78 --> 00:49:14.46
we're task unit bruiser. And that was one of those things where even though at first people were

404
00:49:14.46 --> 00:49:19.02
kind of, what's this all about? But then after a little while, they're like, oh, no, no,

405
00:49:19.02 --> 00:49:26.22
because you're in a task unit, I'm in task unit bruiser. And it really does have a legit effect.

406
00:49:26.22 --> 00:49:32.06
It's like a little psychological sense of pride. Like, we're this unique kind of almost elite

407
00:49:32.94 --> 00:49:38.14
group. Just in that small little psychological way. Yeah. And yeah, I think branding a lot of

408
00:49:38.14 --> 00:49:45.42
that has a lot to do with branding where you get like a company, for example. You do just little

409
00:49:45.42 --> 00:49:50.22
things different and include everyone, whether it be the name, whether it be little, I mean,

410
00:49:50.22 --> 00:49:56.86
sometimes they do it with like team building exercises, which I've seen a lot of ones that

411
00:49:56.86 --> 00:50:01.98
that don't really, they're not very effective. But there's certain things that if those activities

412
00:50:01.98 --> 00:50:06.62
can kind of invoke a sense of pride, and you guys are doing it together, that's one, that's one

413
00:50:06.62 --> 00:50:11.18
that can work. And the name thing, it's crazy how that's such a big thing. When you're a little

414
00:50:11.18 --> 00:50:16.06
bit, when you have a cool name, it's almost like a gang mentality. It is. I mean, he literally says

415
00:50:16.06 --> 00:50:20.54
you're, they had no unit identity. So guess what? He's going to pick that identity,

416
00:50:20.54 --> 00:50:25.26
call him the hard core, call him the recondo. He's going to give them that identity and give

417
00:50:25.26 --> 00:50:29.42
them something to latch on to. And he goes even further. So he talks about how in the past when

418
00:50:29.42 --> 00:50:36.30
he was in with another unit, they had this greeting between officers and elicid guys. And the

419
00:50:36.30 --> 00:50:41.34
officer would say airborne in the, in the cigar would say all the way. So the airborne all the way.

420
00:50:42.06 --> 00:50:47.34
And so now these guys are in Vietnam, and it's a little bit different. It's a little bit harder.

421
00:50:47.34 --> 00:50:55.18
So now, this is going back to the book. When a soldier saluted an officer, he said hard core recondo

422
00:50:55.18 --> 00:51:07.02
was sir. And when the officer responded, it was with a heartfelt, no fucking slack. And I mean,

423
00:51:07.02 --> 00:51:11.66
it doesn't get any better than that. And as a matter of fact, when this is one of the most

424
00:51:11.66 --> 00:51:19.02
fired up things, when I, when I retired from the SEAL teams, the guys that ran the land warfare

425
00:51:19.02 --> 00:51:24.70
training. So like the most miserable hard training out in the Imperial Valley of California, where

426
00:51:24.70 --> 00:51:30.14
it's 120 degrees and you're humping through the desert and it's just completely hard core.

427
00:51:30.14 --> 00:51:36.86
And we would, I mean, the training was miserable and tough and realistic and bad ass. And when I left,

428
00:51:36.86 --> 00:51:44.14
those guys from the land warfare group gave me a shotgun. And on the shotgun was engraved, no fucking slack.

429
00:51:45.82 --> 00:51:49.50
So, so you picture these guys walking around. It's like you just said, you're talking about

430
00:51:49.50 --> 00:51:53.90
unit identity and they give them this name. But now they're walking on it every time they see each other.

431
00:51:53.90 --> 00:51:59.34
They're saying hardcore recondo, no fucking slack. And I don't care, that's a mantra.

432
00:51:59.34 --> 00:52:04.38
You know, that becomes a mantra, that becomes a what you say. And that doesn't take much for what

433
00:52:04.38 --> 00:52:11.10
you say to start to become what you believe. And so I love that. I love and when we work with

434
00:52:11.10 --> 00:52:14.94
companies, we, you know, depending on how long we're working with them for, we'll sit down and

435
00:52:14.94 --> 00:52:18.54
we'll have them come up with a mission statement. Yeah. And then we'll come up with some kind of a

436
00:52:18.54 --> 00:52:22.22
mantra. And I'll tell them this story about no fucking slack. And you know, like, what is going to

437
00:52:22.22 --> 00:52:26.86
make you? What is going to make you think that way? Because that's what I used to say at land warfare.

438
00:52:26.86 --> 00:52:32.14
You know, when I was running land warfare training, you know, hey, should we give these guys a little

439
00:52:32.14 --> 00:52:36.54
extra time? Should we give them that you should we move the target a little bit closer to the insert point?

440
00:52:36.54 --> 00:52:42.22
Are these, can we make this a little bit easier for them? And I'd say, no fucking slack.

441
00:52:44.14 --> 00:52:48.94
And the reason was, I wanted these guys to be ready. I wanted everyone of those seals that was

442
00:52:48.94 --> 00:52:52.62
going to Iraq and Afghanistan to be ready for anything to be ready. I wanted the training to be

443
00:52:52.62 --> 00:52:58.14
harder than real combat. That was the goal. And then these these little mantras and all these things

444
00:52:58.14 --> 00:53:04.94
that kind of gives everyone a sense of pride in going through that hard training to, to ultimately

445
00:53:04.94 --> 00:53:11.10
result in being ready. Right. So for them to, to take pride and enjoy it in that hard training,

446
00:53:11.10 --> 00:53:15.42
because of these little tiny things, that makes it just that much more effective, you know, the

447
00:53:15.42 --> 00:53:24.30
whole situation. It's, it's completely true. There's another piece here. Simon Tannies

448
00:53:24.30 --> 00:53:29.10
are going back to the book. Simon Tannies, I started establishing standard operating procedures

449
00:53:29.10 --> 00:53:35.58
that would not only keep the troops alive, but also give them for the first time, the feeling

450
00:53:35.58 --> 00:53:43.18
they were in charge of the situation, not at mercy of the VC or in cityous booby traps. So

451
00:53:43.18 --> 00:53:49.74
think about that, you know, this, this idea that you're on the defense all the time,

452
00:53:50.30 --> 00:53:54.14
and you're constantly like waiting to get blown up or waiting to get more good,

453
00:53:54.14 --> 00:53:59.10
or waiting to get a take a sniper around. That's a horrible, horrible feeling. Being on the receiving

454
00:53:59.10 --> 00:54:03.18
end of that stuff is horrible because you don't have control over it. So then they started

455
00:54:03.18 --> 00:54:12.70
slowly putting things together to to go on the offensive. So standard operating procedures included

456
00:54:12.70 --> 00:54:18.94
such things as every officer having to read Mowl's little red book. So this was kind of the

457
00:54:18.94 --> 00:54:24.94
communist way, and he wanted all the officers to know and understand that, because how can you be

458
00:54:24.94 --> 00:54:33.90
an enemy if you don't know what they're thinking? That was another just classic move. You've got to

459
00:54:33.90 --> 00:54:43.82
think like the enemy. I got a couple more things to pull out here. People talking about

460
00:54:45.82 --> 00:54:51.66
Karen for your guys, and here's another good, you know, I, this is going back to the book. I wasn't

461
00:54:51.66 --> 00:54:58.14
going to lose any legs for a couple of VC. I was into fighting hard, but not the expense of

462
00:54:58.14 --> 00:55:03.42
bleeding troops. The fact that I, that I walked with the platoons put me in the good graces and

463
00:55:03.42 --> 00:55:09.58
a lot of men. But my stock, he rose even faster when they got word, when word got around that I

464
00:55:09.58 --> 00:55:15.98
wasn't a butcher. So even though he was hardcore and he was saying no fucking slack, what he talks

465
00:55:15.98 --> 00:55:20.30
about earlier in that paragraph is if he found one of the young officers was doing something that

466
00:55:20.30 --> 00:55:24.46
was careless, that could put guys at risk of running into the booby traps or and that what that

467
00:55:24.46 --> 00:55:29.82
didn't have a good return, he'd fire that guy. He would literally just fire the guy. And that

468
00:55:29.82 --> 00:55:35.82
the end. So the guy's realized, okay, this guy's hardcore, but guess what, he cares about us. And that,

469
00:55:37.58 --> 00:55:42.94
that is huge. And another piece, this is kind of going back to what we just said.

470
00:55:43.98 --> 00:55:50.86
All the 439 really needed, had really needed. Was a good kick in the ass, which included creating

471
00:55:50.86 --> 00:55:57.82
or bringing in leaders who cared for their men and giving the men some sense of real purpose.

472
00:55:57.82 --> 00:56:05.58
Wow. Wow. You know, and what we call that in with Lafayne, I talk about in the book,

473
00:56:05.58 --> 00:56:13.90
it's the why, why are we here? And you would be surprised. It happens with companies. It happens with

474
00:56:13.90 --> 00:56:20.06
families. It happens in the military. It happens with teams. They don't understand why they're doing

475
00:56:20.06 --> 00:56:24.30
what they're doing. They're just doing it as a task, as a robot. And you can't treat people like

476
00:56:24.30 --> 00:56:30.06
robot. People have to have some kind of long-term goal. They have to have an understanding of why they're

477
00:56:30.06 --> 00:56:36.38
doing what they're doing. So that's like 99% of my answers. When somebody says, hey, I've got this

478
00:56:36.38 --> 00:56:41.34
problem with these people. Don't want to follow this rule. They don't want to do this safety

479
00:56:42.86 --> 00:56:47.74
task or safety procedure. I can't get my guys to do the safety procedure. And I'm like,

480
00:56:47.74 --> 00:56:52.94
what do they understand? Why they're doing it? What do you mean? Do they understand why they

481
00:56:52.94 --> 00:56:57.26
are doing it? Do they understand why they are supposed to clip in at the end top of the tower

482
00:56:57.26 --> 00:57:01.26
that they're climbing? Do they understand why? Do they understand the implications? If they fall,

483
00:57:01.26 --> 00:57:04.62
do they understand the implications? Not just to them, but to their family. Are they thinking about

484
00:57:04.62 --> 00:57:08.22
the implications to their job? Or they think about the implications to the company? And then

485
00:57:08.22 --> 00:57:13.18
other people's jobs. You put all those why? Here's why you're clip it into that tower. Because if

486
00:57:13.18 --> 00:57:18.38
you fall, you can't pay your mortgage. Your kids, you know, can't eat. Then on top of that,

487
00:57:18.38 --> 00:57:21.82
we have to shut down the tower for a week. We're going to lose money. We're going to lose jobs.

488
00:57:21.82 --> 00:57:25.42
And when you think about why, then all of a sudden, they're going to go, okay, I guess I'll clip in.

489
00:57:26.70 --> 00:57:34.14
It's one of those things. So that idea of understanding why is just extremely important.

490
00:57:36.38 --> 00:57:46.30
To close out this section on about face, which again, depending on, I don't know, this

491
00:57:46.30 --> 00:57:55.66
maybe, maybe this was just an exercise in my own. In my own, what is it? Was that word selfishness?

492
00:57:55.66 --> 00:58:01.18
Take the elbow talk about this with people and have them here. And for me to go through this book,

493
00:58:01.18 --> 00:58:06.22
again, again, I learned every time I read it, but to kind of wrap it up. So he goes on and they go on.

494
00:58:06.22 --> 00:58:12.78
This is a long chapter and they go on to talk about all these different things that they did.

495
00:58:12.78 --> 00:58:17.18
And they did turn the fight and they did start to kill the enemy and they did start to spare their own guys.

496
00:58:17.18 --> 00:58:22.46
And they, they started fighting the gorillas like they were gorillas. So he really implemented all those things that they had talked about.

497
00:58:23.50 --> 00:58:26.94
So now he's getting ready to leave. And he says,

498
00:58:28.94 --> 00:58:34.94
the hardcore battalion proved to me everything I'd ruminated on throughout the two years that went before.

499
00:58:34.94 --> 00:58:38.78
All those ideas and theories on how to fight the G and the G is gorillas.

500
00:58:38.78 --> 00:58:44.94
If there was satisfaction in that, there was much less in the fact that my success didn't make

501
00:58:44.94 --> 00:58:51.82
a dent in the way the war was prosecuted. So even though he did a great job and it really changed their

502
00:58:51.82 --> 00:58:57.02
battlefield for him, other people didn't say, oh, I see what they're doing. I'm going to do that too.

503
00:58:57.98 --> 00:59:04.30
Ironically, what did was the debacle of hamburger here? Hill, where screaming eagle,

504
00:59:04.30 --> 00:59:14.30
general Melvin Zace ordered 11 assaults up an extremely well fortified totally useless piece of real estate.

505
00:59:14.30 --> 00:59:21.74
As if he thought, as if he thought he was in Korea or storming crowd positions at Normandy.

506
00:59:22.46 --> 00:59:28.54
Almost 400 American men, Dan, or wounded later, the 101 unit was King of the Mountain.

507
00:59:29.50 --> 00:59:32.30
But within a week, the objective was abandoned.

508
00:59:32.30 --> 00:59:35.26
So I don't know if you've ever heard this, but hamburger Hill is a huge deal.

509
00:59:35.26 --> 00:59:39.42
Lost 400 guys wounded or dead held it for a week and then left.

510
00:59:40.78 --> 00:59:44.30
The ensuing horrified up roar among American people and in Washington,

511
00:59:44.30 --> 00:59:48.86
made sure hamburger Hill was the last huge and costly battle fought by American troops in Vietnam.

512
00:59:49.66 --> 00:59:55.34
So I guess if no one learned how to fight the war for me and the men of the hardcore,

513
00:59:55.34 --> 00:59:59.10
at least from general Zace, they finally learned how not to.

514
00:59:59.10 --> 01:00:05.18
But we were already four years into the war and they were almost four more to go.

515
01:00:10.62 --> 01:00:20.06
Tough. So that's about face for you. That is a heavy book, figuratively, and literally.

516
01:00:20.94 --> 01:00:28.70
And again, depending on what people thought of that, maybe we'll come back to it and talk about it again.

517
01:00:28.70 --> 01:00:29.34
In the future.

518
01:00:31.10 --> 01:00:36.30
That book and those experiences are kind of where this comes from.

519
01:00:36.78 --> 01:00:43.74
This mindset and the attitude that I have. How much of it do you think?

520
01:00:43.74 --> 01:00:46.46
I don't. I couldn't sit here and put a percent of Jonathan.

521
01:00:47.18 --> 01:00:52.78
From a leadership, from a combat leadership perspective, it is a pretty significant amount.

522
01:00:52.78 --> 01:01:01.02
You know, it's probably in the 20 or 30 percent of confirming things that I believed,

523
01:01:01.82 --> 01:01:07.98
learning new things, seeing things and reading about them and then watching them happen and

524
01:01:07.98 --> 01:01:14.86
understanding them. So that it definitely is a significant portion of some kind.

525
01:01:14.86 --> 01:01:25.58
Yeah. Meanwhile, on the internet. On the interwebs, we got a bunch of great questions.

526
01:01:25.58 --> 01:01:31.26
I mean, we got hundreds of great questions. And obviously, we can't answer them all.

527
01:01:32.30 --> 01:01:40.06
So some of them, we kind of compiled together. Some of them, we pulled out. And you know what I did not do.

528
01:01:40.06 --> 01:01:46.30
Because I did not put the names of the people that submitted them. So next time, I will do that.

529
01:01:47.10 --> 01:01:53.42
I think we got one person that recommended that. So I apologize for everyone out there on Twitter

530
01:01:53.42 --> 01:02:00.14
and Facebook that submitted questions. And we used them next time. I'll try and get your name in there.

531
01:02:00.14 --> 01:02:10.62
So you'll know that I am talking to you. But we've got some great feedback and comments and all that.

532
01:02:10.62 --> 01:02:16.22
So let's dive into some of these. Okay. So mental toughness. We're going back to this. I think this is

533
01:02:16.22 --> 01:02:23.26
important mental toughness. Because I think this is one of those things. That's a constant endeavor for

534
01:02:24.46 --> 01:02:30.06
I would argue for everybody. I would agree. In one way or another. And this question

535
01:02:30.06 --> 01:02:36.30
is really appropriate. Mental toughness is not just one thing. Some people are tough in the gym or in

536
01:02:36.30 --> 01:02:41.10
fights, but week when their wife leaves them. For example, do you agree with that? And this guy,

537
01:02:41.10 --> 01:02:46.22
and again, I wish I had whoever you are, I apologize because he actually makes a statement.

538
01:02:46.22 --> 01:02:52.54
This is a statement. Mental toughness is not one thing. And then he quantifies that statement by

539
01:02:52.54 --> 01:02:58.06
saying some people are tough in the gym or in fights, but week when their lives, when their wives

540
01:02:58.06 --> 01:03:11.10
leaves them, he says, do you agree? Well, I agree 100%. And this opens up a whole spectrum of reality.

541
01:03:12.14 --> 01:03:22.46
And that is that what is it that crushes a person? Because it's different for everybody.

542
01:03:22.46 --> 01:03:29.34
Everybody has this thing, this weakness that maybe it never gets uncovered. Maybe it does.

543
01:03:29.34 --> 01:03:36.86
And the fact that he's talking about fighters and saying that people are tough in the gym,

544
01:03:36.86 --> 01:03:43.58
they're tough in fights, but they have some weakness that can crush them. I think we've seen

545
01:03:43.58 --> 01:03:50.62
that plenty. I mean, just famous people, famous fighters that this has happened to, John Bones Jones.

546
01:03:50.62 --> 01:03:55.34
I mean, obviously the guy's an animal in fights. He's an animal training in the gym,

547
01:03:55.90 --> 01:04:02.78
but he has some mental weaknesses that he needs to overcome. And that hopefully he will be able to,

548
01:04:02.78 --> 01:04:11.10
so he can reach his full potential. And I hope he does, but he's lucky he's got a good

549
01:04:11.10 --> 01:04:20.86
support base around him and he's got money to try and solve these problems. Because there's a lot of

550
01:04:20.86 --> 01:04:27.10
people that end up with those weaknesses or have those weaknesses and ends up crushing them. And that's scary.

551
01:04:28.54 --> 01:04:34.14
And I'll tell you what the scariest thing is. And I think this is a great lesson. And it's something

552
01:04:34.14 --> 01:04:39.74
that I learned over and over again. And I don't know when it exactly solidified in my brain,

553
01:04:39.74 --> 01:04:48.46
but it's so disturbing and bizarre when you see somebody that you care about.

554
01:04:50.62 --> 01:04:59.50
And you watch them go down the spiral. And it's so obvious what they have to do to stop it,

555
01:04:59.50 --> 01:05:05.98
to stop the downward spiral. It's like, oh, uh, get rid of that girl or get stop using that drug

556
01:05:05.98 --> 01:05:11.02
or stop drinking or do whatever the case may be, whatever that thing that's got them.

557
01:05:12.06 --> 01:05:18.38
And you're clearly telling them to stop it. And they don't. Yeah, because, I mean, and I think I,

558
01:05:18.38 --> 01:05:23.18
I think I know what your point is going to be here. But you say it's clearly obvious.

559
01:05:24.86 --> 01:05:30.54
It's clearly obvious kind of a way to put it in, it's clearly obvious on paper. Where you could

560
01:05:30.54 --> 01:05:36.06
point it out in that person, the person you care about, he's you, whatever. They would probably agree with you.

561
01:05:36.06 --> 01:05:41.58
And you said, oh, is this holding you back, you think, or is this jamming you up? And they'd probably say,

562
01:05:41.58 --> 01:05:46.46
yeah, but to be like, oh, just simply let it go, let's say it was a girl. Let's say, I don't know.

563
01:05:46.46 --> 01:05:51.50
Yeah, oh, good girl. Yeah. Yeah. Um, and you're like, yeah, the girl's jamming me up.

564
01:05:51.50 --> 01:05:58.94
Yeah, generally I let's be fair or like, or a guy. Um, and you know, it's as simple as that, get rid of the girl.

565
01:05:58.94 --> 01:06:04.94
But I think in everybody's different, there's a certain need that someone has an inherent need

566
01:06:04.94 --> 01:06:11.42
that that that girl is fulfilling. And that need is big. No matter how deep down it is,

567
01:06:11.42 --> 01:06:17.02
it's a big need. Obviously, that they're letting that need get fulfilled in, at the expense of

568
01:06:17.02 --> 01:06:22.78
their goals, their training, or whatever. So it's not that easy. It's obvious, sure.

569
01:06:22.78 --> 01:06:26.46
But it's just not that easy to be the oldest, just get rid of the girl. I didn't say it was easy.

570
01:06:26.46 --> 01:06:30.70
Right. But I know you've seen this. I think we've all seen this where you're looking at a

571
01:06:30.70 --> 01:06:35.98
situation with someone that you truly cared about and you want to help them and you could write

572
01:06:35.98 --> 01:06:41.90
down in two sentences. What they have to do to completely resurrect and change their life.

573
01:06:41.90 --> 01:06:49.26
And it's as easy as getting rid of a girl or a guy that's in their life that's a disaster,

574
01:06:49.26 --> 01:06:56.78
or it's as easy as stopping the use of drugs now called or it's as easy as cutting sugar out of

575
01:06:56.78 --> 01:07:03.50
your diet because you're sick from it. Or it's as easy as working out a certain methodology

576
01:07:03.50 --> 01:07:10.30
to get you through this situation. So it's it's horrible. And it's one of those things. That's it for

577
01:07:10.30 --> 01:07:17.66
me. It's taught me to again, I talk about detachment, I want detached from myself to make sure I'm not

578
01:07:17.66 --> 01:07:23.66
that guy that doesn't have some issue that's holding me back and like I could be doing better

579
01:07:23.66 --> 01:07:28.86
if I would get if I would take that input from other people or even better off if I could detach and

580
01:07:28.86 --> 01:07:35.50
see that input myself and self correct. Yeah. But when you can see it in someone else,

581
01:07:35.50 --> 01:07:41.10
that's really what you what the dynamics of that relationship is. Meaning let's say you know your

582
01:07:41.10 --> 01:07:46.38
friend has something a girl. For example holding him back. It's easy for you to say, oh just do this.

583
01:07:46.38 --> 01:07:50.22
Here's the two sentences. It's like going to do get rid of the girl. Be happy. That's it. It's easy

584
01:07:50.22 --> 01:07:55.34
because you are detached. Yeah. Absolutely. So the hard part is for him to actually detach. But if

585
01:07:55.34 --> 01:08:00.70
he can detach, look in, he'd be essentially in the same position as you and probably be able to

586
01:08:00.70 --> 01:08:07.34
at least be on his way to do it. Exactly. It's weird though. And that's why I say people are crazy.

587
01:08:07.90 --> 01:08:14.78
Like we do crazy things. We make big mistakes. We get emotional. We do things that are crazy. Human beings

588
01:08:14.78 --> 01:08:22.46
do it. And that's very, very difficult to deal with. And it's really, it can be very sad to see.

589
01:08:22.46 --> 01:08:29.90
You know, I've seen people with great unbelievable potential that have for all practical purposes

590
01:08:29.90 --> 01:08:36.06
cast it away for some ridiculous reason that again, if they would have followed two bullet points

591
01:08:36.06 --> 01:08:41.58
on a piece of paper that said, get rid of this girl and stop using this drug. Their life would be

592
01:08:41.58 --> 01:08:46.70
different. And you just, you can't help them. Yeah. And obviously, you know, getting rid of a girl,

593
01:08:47.58 --> 01:08:52.38
that's clearly just an example. It's not, we're not saying girls. You need sort of a problem.

594
01:08:52.38 --> 01:08:57.58
But we've seen the same thing with girls and guys. Right. Girls that had date this guy. That's a

595
01:08:57.58 --> 01:09:01.98
disaster that drags me down and whatever. Yeah. And it could be either one. We should just say

596
01:09:01.98 --> 01:09:07.10
relationships and be in fair. Yeah. Yeah. Toxic relationship. Yeah. Toxic relationship.

597
01:09:08.46 --> 01:09:13.26
I don't, I mean, you use the word ridiculous, which, you know, cool. But I don't think it is

598
01:09:13.26 --> 01:09:17.74
really ridiculous because if you kind of, if you break it down, I think like I said,

599
01:09:19.26 --> 01:09:24.70
they have a certain need that isn't obvious to everyone, you know, everyone, I said,

600
01:09:24.70 --> 01:09:28.06
even to them, it might not be obvious. But they have a need in there that this

601
01:09:29.58 --> 01:09:34.38
toxic relationship is fulfilling. It's jamming up a bunch of other things in their life for

602
01:09:34.38 --> 01:09:40.54
their goals. But it is fulfilling this little thing that they need. Well, okay, you can say that.

603
01:09:40.54 --> 01:09:45.34
That's, that's, that's, that's, that's, that makes sense. I'm not gonna argue with you. That's,

604
01:09:45.34 --> 01:09:51.34
that's the, that's the route of the problem though. Right. But if, if that need is, if, basically,

605
01:09:51.34 --> 01:09:59.10
the, the, the sum of that need or the, the size of that size bigger than the need of them,

606
01:09:59.10 --> 01:10:03.58
achieving those goals. Which may seem weird because it's like, well, that teeny tiny need to be

607
01:10:03.58 --> 01:10:10.14
loved or accepted is bigger than being a champion of the world. It seems weird. But from an

608
01:10:10.14 --> 01:10:18.38
individual standpoint on how they feel on the inside that need in a lot of times is bigger. Yeah.

609
01:10:18.38 --> 01:10:23.66
And that's what's crazy, which is what we said people are crazy because they made that determination.

610
01:10:23.66 --> 01:10:27.66
Yeah. And you can't help them. That's the piece. You cannot help them. Yeah.

611
01:10:28.38 --> 01:10:32.22
And you can try. You can paint it out for them. You can tell them a thousand times, a thousand

612
01:10:32.22 --> 01:10:38.46
different ways. Yeah. I think you, yeah. I think there are ways to help, obviously, I think it's like

613
01:10:38.46 --> 01:10:43.02
through like a therapy type of situation, not necessarily like a professional therapy maybe,

614
01:10:43.02 --> 01:10:48.14
but not necessarily or something really impactful. Oh, yeah. I always hear, you know, you always

615
01:10:48.14 --> 01:10:54.06
hear it's got to be the rock bottom. The person's got to hit rock bottom somehow. And then they

616
01:10:54.06 --> 01:10:57.90
realize, oh, okay, I've destroyed my life. Now I'll start moving again. You just wish you could help

617
01:10:57.90 --> 01:11:03.26
them before they hit rock bottom. I was talking about this today with, uh, with great hitting rock bottom.

618
01:11:03.26 --> 01:11:10.30
And the reason that it's, tip it and I don't, I'll just use word easier. It's easier to move

619
01:11:10.30 --> 01:11:16.14
forward when you hit rock bottom is because you're not, you can't go any further deeper, but what

620
01:11:16.14 --> 01:11:22.30
that I mean, that sounds obvious, but what that means is you're here right at the bottom. If

621
01:11:23.74 --> 01:11:29.50
below here is unacceptable, it's death, or it's, you know, on a jail, I don't know, whatever, whatever

622
01:11:29.50 --> 01:11:36.70
you rock bottom is. So you can never justify it. Oh, I've been doing it this way and I'm still here.

623
01:11:36.70 --> 01:11:40.70
You can never make that justification at rock bottom because I've been doing it this way and I'm here.

624
01:11:40.70 --> 01:11:44.70
That's unacceptable. You're rock bottom. But let's say you're not at rock bottom, but you're pretty

625
01:11:44.70 --> 01:11:49.98
junk. You're not doing good. But you're making it, you're handling it. Sure, you're job sucks.

626
01:11:49.98 --> 01:11:55.58
But I'm still here. You know, I still got my car. Yeah, so they don't want to justify it. Yes,

627
01:11:55.58 --> 01:11:59.42
yeah, one thing. Okay, look, I need to make an improvement. I'm going to start. I'm going to start

628
01:11:59.42 --> 01:12:03.74
on Monday. I'm going to make an improvement. So they start on Monday. Okay, it goes good Tuesday.

629
01:12:03.74 --> 01:12:11.74
Some temptation comes and whatever the drugs are drinking, whatever. When they're kind of exhausted

630
01:12:11.74 --> 01:12:16.78
from putting in that effort to change and it's like, okay, I'll just have one beer. Okay, I'll just

631
01:12:16.78 --> 01:12:23.26
start drinking again because really, I'm cool with it. You know, I made it. It's not all that bad.

632
01:12:23.26 --> 01:12:28.14
They've accepted their station in life. Right. And somebody accepts their station in life.

633
01:12:28.14 --> 01:12:33.34
Then I guess they're not going to be motivated to do anything. Right. So, and that accepting their

634
01:12:33.34 --> 01:12:38.22
station is essentially their justification for relapse. But when you're at rock bottom, you can't do that.

635
01:12:38.94 --> 01:12:43.10
So, I mean, obviously, people's rock bottom are different. Like I said, but that's the reason

636
01:12:43.74 --> 01:12:49.10
that it's that it's easier. I know it sounds crazy, but it's easier to move forward when you're at rock bottom.

637
01:12:49.10 --> 01:12:55.50
It's tough stuff. So, yeah, mental toughness. Yeah, like how you said it is, it's different for

638
01:12:55.50 --> 01:12:59.74
everyone and you can be meant. It's not across the board thing. You're just mentally tough.

639
01:12:59.74 --> 01:13:06.38
Yeah. But to tie this back into mental toughness is again, go back to detachment. You know,

640
01:13:06.38 --> 01:13:10.14
I'm glad we're most of the people listening this aren't dealing with a situation where they've

641
01:13:10.14 --> 01:13:15.90
got some grievous scenario going on. And their life is on a downward spiral. Hopefully,

642
01:13:16.54 --> 01:13:21.74
we're downward spiral is that you slept in until five, third, you know, that's that's the type

643
01:13:21.74 --> 01:13:24.86
of thing where you want to catch yourself. Like we talked about earlier, you want to get those

644
01:13:24.86 --> 01:13:31.50
little disciplines in place and build upon those and become better. Yeah. Stay out of them.

645
01:13:31.50 --> 01:13:35.34
Never mind the rock bottom. Let's get to the top of this bad boy. That's what I'm talking about.

646
01:13:35.34 --> 01:13:40.46
Yeah, and with that, I think this might be kind of obvious, but it's important to recognize what

647
01:13:41.26 --> 01:13:47.18
elements or what aspects of your life that you are not quite as tough, mentally at. You know,

648
01:13:47.18 --> 01:13:53.66
like you're, you know, if you have a weakness for beer and alcohol, then recognize that or

649
01:13:53.66 --> 01:13:57.74
have a weakness for giving up when I start to get tired and training or something like that,

650
01:13:58.86 --> 01:14:02.78
recognize that. Yeah. And here's a quick story for you. It's important story.

651
01:14:03.82 --> 01:14:11.50
Echo Trials with the story. Christmas Eve. I went to the store just for real quick and it was real

652
01:14:11.50 --> 01:14:19.10
crowded that supermarket. So I go and I get two 12 fats a beer and

653
01:14:19.10 --> 01:14:28.46
some tomatoes and I have a cart. Not or I have a basket and not a cart. So I'm carrying it.

654
01:14:28.46 --> 01:14:35.02
So all the lines are long. So I'm standing in one of the lines and I'm holding the basket with

655
01:14:35.02 --> 01:14:40.86
a 12 back of beer in one hand with the tomatoes and the other 12 back of beer in the other hand.

656
01:14:40.86 --> 01:14:47.10
So it's not like terribly heavy, but it can get heavy after a little while. So the lines

657
01:14:47.10 --> 01:14:51.42
were a long. So I'm going to be in that line for a while. So after all, you know, you show this

658
01:14:51.42 --> 01:14:58.22
start getting tired and right then I recognize, okay, this can be a small exercise and mental

659
01:14:58.22 --> 01:15:03.90
toughness. Just a small one. Not a, you know, not a marathon and nothing like that, but you know what I'm

660
01:15:03.90 --> 01:15:07.34
going to do? I'm just going to hold these until until I put them on the thing, I'm not going to put

661
01:15:07.34 --> 01:15:15.10
them down because right now I kind of want to put them down. So what I did is I made it consciously made it

662
01:15:15.10 --> 01:15:20.54
in exercise. So I held them and every little thing that would happen, this guy's not taking

663
01:15:21.18 --> 01:15:25.42
or this guy's not being as quick as he should be. Boom that, that's another element added to the

664
01:15:25.42 --> 01:15:32.86
mental toughness exercise. No, he's going to write a check. Yeah. So I did it. I totally did it.

665
01:15:32.86 --> 01:15:37.18
It took maybe I would say 10 minutes. We could 10 minutes of just holding it, you know.

666
01:15:37.18 --> 01:15:46.06
So I put my, my stuff on the, on the little carousel, whatever to get it checked out. And I remember

667
01:15:46.06 --> 01:15:52.06
thinking, okay, that's one little exercise in mental toughness, a little workout mental toughness done.

668
01:15:52.70 --> 01:15:58.70
Now, I realize as a demonstration of mental toughness, that's quite lame.

669
01:15:58.70 --> 01:16:07.66
But as far as recognizing a potential situation where you could be mentally weak, using it as an

670
01:16:07.66 --> 01:16:13.42
exercise to be to help with mental toughness as a concept, that's an important element.

671
01:16:13.42 --> 01:16:18.86
And you know what I like the best about that whole story was the fact that you had to mentally

672
01:16:18.86 --> 01:16:26.54
detach yourself and recognize because that's the true exercise in my mind is having the ability

673
01:16:26.54 --> 01:16:30.62
to be outside yourself and look at yourself and say you're being weak right now or here's

674
01:16:30.62 --> 01:16:39.10
an opportunity. That's real triumph on a small scale. Yeah. And it, it, it's super working to me.

675
01:16:39.10 --> 01:16:47.34
Yeah. But if you can just start thinking to yourself that way, that small little exercise

676
01:16:47.34 --> 01:16:52.30
can turn into a little bit bigger exercise and next thing you know, you're in a detrimental

677
01:16:52.30 --> 01:16:58.06
situation, recognizing, hey, if I can practice some toughness right now where, you know, a month ago,

678
01:16:58.06 --> 01:17:02.38
two months ago, I would have straight up gave up. But let me use this as yet another exercise.

679
01:17:02.38 --> 01:17:05.58
And it's a big detrimental situation. We're being a lucky, mentally tough.

680
01:17:06.86 --> 01:17:09.98
I like it. At least on your way. Yeah. Approved. Sure.

681
01:17:09.98 --> 01:17:11.90
Barely approved. But approved nonetheless.

682
01:17:11.90 --> 01:17:27.90
Yes. Next question. Okay. Okay. Next question is my son who's seven, seven years old,

683
01:17:27.90 --> 01:17:34.14
and I want to get into jujitsu. What lessons has it taught you in life?

684
01:17:34.14 --> 01:17:41.90
Well, you know, I talk about jujitsu all the time because I do think it's a great metaphor for

685
01:17:41.90 --> 01:17:46.62
life. Some of the things that it teaches you without a doubt is it teaches you humility.

686
01:17:47.82 --> 01:17:52.62
Because it's not going to teach you humility by telling you, hey, be humble, be humble. It's

687
01:17:52.62 --> 01:17:59.50
going to teach you humility because you are going to get submitted and be forced to surrender

688
01:17:59.50 --> 01:18:05.18
to people that are smaller than you, that are weaker than you, that aren't as good as athletes as you.

689
01:18:05.18 --> 01:18:12.06
And that's going to happen almost a daily basis when you first start out. So there's no doubt about that.

690
01:18:12.62 --> 01:18:18.14
It's going to teach you about respect. And I had a buddy in the Marine Corps,

691
01:18:19.26 --> 01:18:27.26
great dude, a big H. I know you're out there somewhere. And he was a badass. He looked like a super hero,

692
01:18:27.26 --> 01:18:34.78
so super strong. And he grew up in Texas. He was some kind of a gang member in Texas,

693
01:18:34.78 --> 01:18:41.82
had a rough childhood. He was used a badass, scary dude, super nice, but but definitely could bring

694
01:18:41.82 --> 01:18:48.54
it. And when he started training, after like a month, you know, I said, you know, what do you

695
01:18:48.54 --> 01:18:55.66
think of jujitsu? And he said, you know, I used to think I was badass. And now I don't want to mess

696
01:18:55.66 --> 01:19:01.02
with anybody because I don't know if they've been training for three months. And if they have been,

697
01:19:01.02 --> 01:19:05.82
I'm in trouble. So you definitely will learn respect from jujitsu.

698
01:19:07.66 --> 01:19:13.18
Discipline, you know, we were just kind of talking earlier. And I was talking about training today

699
01:19:13.18 --> 01:19:17.34
and how I just did not feel like training today. It was all beat up, it was tired of sore.

700
01:19:17.98 --> 01:19:21.50
And there's only one thing that got beyond the mat. And that's just having the discipline to

701
01:19:21.50 --> 01:19:26.22
get on there and know that I needed to train. So there's nobody out of care who you are that feels

702
01:19:26.22 --> 01:19:31.26
like training every single day, seven days a week. But if you want to get better and you want to reach

703
01:19:31.26 --> 01:19:37.26
the goal, then you have to do it. And so it teaches you about discipline. And I would say

704
01:19:38.46 --> 01:19:45.02
from a mental perspective, one of the coolest things that jujitsu teaches you is it teaches you

705
01:19:45.02 --> 01:19:58.70
that maneuver and that tactics and that brains, the those things, Trump strength and Trump meeting

706
01:19:58.70 --> 01:20:04.38
force on force. And I talk about this all the time in psychological situations. And it's too

707
01:20:04.38 --> 01:20:08.06
bad. I wish everybody in the world train jujitsu because you have all these metaphors that you can tell

708
01:20:08.06 --> 01:20:12.86
them. So it's great when I have a client that actually trains jujitsu because then I can or

709
01:20:12.86 --> 01:20:18.70
understand them and they're watching martial arts or watches UFC because then you can use these examples.

710
01:20:19.50 --> 01:20:26.94
But the classic case in the mental confrontation is people have a tendency to want to go

711
01:20:28.22 --> 01:20:35.34
fist on fist. And if you say one thing, if you say method A, I say method B and we'll just

712
01:20:35.34 --> 01:20:40.46
gonna bang those two methods together and see who a lot of times it's see who has more rank.

713
01:20:40.46 --> 01:20:44.94
And you know what, you know what echo, I'm in charge so we're going with method B. Well now you're

714
01:20:44.94 --> 01:20:49.34
gonna do what I say, but you're not gonna do it willingly, you're gonna sabotage it, whatever the case

715
01:20:49.34 --> 01:21:00.30
may be. That's not jujitsu. Jujitsu is using maneuver and setting people up and being more crafty.

716
01:21:00.30 --> 01:21:05.26
That's what jujitsu is and that's how you win and that's how you win not just on the mat, not just

717
01:21:05.26 --> 01:21:09.42
but in life as well. And it's the same thing on the battlefield. You know, we have a little saying

718
01:21:09.42 --> 01:21:16.06
in combat, he who flanks first wins, meaning the person that gets around to the side and attacks

719
01:21:16.06 --> 01:21:21.42
from an unexpected direction is going to win. And it's the same thing in mentally in jujitsu and

720
01:21:21.42 --> 01:21:28.62
it's the same thing in mental confrontations with people. It's who is going to maneuver.

721
01:21:29.34 --> 01:21:36.70
And it's always this indirect approach. That's the key phrase that I use when I'm dealing with someone

722
01:21:36.70 --> 01:21:41.50
that's not a jujitsu person. And I'm talking about how do they deal with their boss that

723
01:21:41.50 --> 01:21:46.22
does this or they're subordinate that has a big head or whatever. I tell them, listen,

724
01:21:46.94 --> 01:21:53.50
you need to use an indirect approach because the direct approach is not going to get through to this

725
01:21:53.50 --> 01:21:58.54
person. I was doing this from executive coaching the other day and had this guy, he explained the

726
01:21:58.54 --> 01:22:04.46
personality of this guy that worked for him and the guy that worked for him had been moved underneath

727
01:22:04.46 --> 01:22:09.34
him in a reorganization and it was one of those guys. He's a senior guy who he should have been

728
01:22:09.34 --> 01:22:12.78
a peer but now all of a sudden he's reporting to him and he's been in the business for 32 years

729
01:22:12.78 --> 01:22:18.86
and he knows stuff better than I do. And then the guy says to me, so I've brought the guy in and

730
01:22:19.74 --> 01:22:23.34
I've told him I'm going to coach him and this is what I'm going to help him with and I said, okay.

731
01:22:24.54 --> 01:22:30.38
You are no way is this guy going to accept that that you're going to coach him. It's

732
01:22:30.38 --> 01:22:36.22
is not in his personality. You can't go whereas this guy that I was talking to, calling Mike, I

733
01:22:36.22 --> 01:22:40.86
said Mike, you want to be coached. You want to be helped. Do you have an open mind? If I came to

734
01:22:40.86 --> 01:22:44.46
you and said, hey, I want to coach you, be like, that's great. This guy is the complete opposite.

735
01:22:44.46 --> 01:22:48.86
If I go to him and say, hey, I'm going to coach you, he's going to say, I don't need to coach him.

736
01:22:48.86 --> 01:22:52.06
Right. And even if I outrank him and I say, no, I'm going to coach you. He's going to do it

737
01:22:52.06 --> 01:22:55.90
reluctantly and he's going to sabotage it and he's never going to put me effort into it and he's going

738
01:22:55.90 --> 01:23:00.46
to actually do the opposite to prove you wrong. Right. Yeah. He's going to secure it. That's the direct

739
01:23:00.46 --> 01:23:05.98
approach. Do you get to is the indirect approach? So what you do with this guy when you're going to

740
01:23:05.98 --> 01:23:11.34
coach him, as you say, listen, you know what I need is you're so much more experienced in this. I need

741
01:23:11.34 --> 01:23:17.98
some help running the organization. Can you come and help me get things in order and give me a hand

742
01:23:17.98 --> 01:23:26.14
straightening things out and also can you fill me in on what we can improve inside of our department.

743
01:23:26.14 --> 01:23:30.46
And when when you're doing that, now all of a sudden he's going to tell me what all the problems are

744
01:23:30.46 --> 01:23:36.30
and now I can just, strictly and indirectly coach him on how we're going to fix those problems.

745
01:23:37.98 --> 01:23:44.94
That's jujitsu and that's one of the lessons you learned from it. Yeah. And not to mention the

746
01:23:44.94 --> 01:23:52.62
sort of more obvious things where it's a great workout, you get kind of this.

747
01:23:56.22 --> 01:24:01.66
Man actually just be all people. They have a sort of aggression kind of built into them. And it's

748
01:24:01.66 --> 01:24:09.18
a spectrum. Some people more than others. You can engage. I understand what you're trying to tell

749
01:24:09.18 --> 01:24:17.82
me. Yeah. You can engage in jujitsu and be a pretty accurate simulation of whether it be a fight

750
01:24:17.82 --> 01:24:24.70
or any kind of aggressive combat situation. And it's still be safe and doable where you can do it

751
01:24:24.70 --> 01:24:32.06
again and again. You can go, you know, the next day. If you go spar boxing, you can't really do it every day.

752
01:24:32.06 --> 01:24:35.58
And you can go all out. If you go all out and do it every day, you can get messed up. Yeah.

753
01:24:35.58 --> 01:24:43.02
And you can do that. And so you get that satisfaction. When you leave and it's kind of strange

754
01:24:43.02 --> 01:24:47.90
because when you get the satisfaction from that, you kind of want to do it some more. You know,

755
01:24:47.90 --> 01:24:51.90
so most people when you talk to people who have been doing it for over a year, talk to everyone,

756
01:24:51.90 --> 01:24:58.14
anyone you know that has been doing it more than one year, I would say my argument would be 85

757
01:24:58.14 --> 01:25:02.54
percent or more. We'll tell you that at some point they were addicted to it. That they would

758
01:25:02.54 --> 01:25:07.34
go to sleep at night and they'd be thinking about a move or something like that. And to go along with

759
01:25:07.34 --> 01:25:11.90
the things that you just the obvious things because you're right, there's some obvious things. The

760
01:25:11.90 --> 01:25:17.10
the workout, it's a great workout. You get more in tune with your own body. You learn how to

761
01:25:17.10 --> 01:25:22.70
hand to yourself in a real fight. And and it does give you absolutely gives you confidence and confidence

762
01:25:22.70 --> 01:25:27.90
that you can handle situation, confidence that that's coupled with the respect that you look at

763
01:25:27.90 --> 01:25:32.70
everyone and say, hey, you know what, this guy might be able to, this guy might know more than I do,

764
01:25:32.70 --> 01:25:37.26
so I'm going to respect him. But at the same time, you know that, hey, I'm going to be able to at

765
01:25:37.26 --> 01:25:41.58
least know what I'm doing very confidently. So it helps out across the board and it's definitely a

766
01:25:42.38 --> 01:25:51.10
great sports. So with the new year approaching, what have you changed your mind about?

767
01:25:51.10 --> 01:26:00.30
Yeah, as far as 2015, well, the biggest thing that's been a radical change because I'm

768
01:26:01.58 --> 01:26:06.14
I always talk about how I have this big open mind and all that. But the fact of the matter is,

769
01:26:06.14 --> 01:26:13.82
I'm very set in my ways and I kind of follow patterns and I believe things and my beliefs are

770
01:26:13.82 --> 01:26:20.94
open for for changing, but a lot of times they just don't get changed. Okay, so one thing that's

771
01:26:20.94 --> 01:26:27.34
been radically different about me in 2015 and it's been kind of a bizarre ride is the fact that I am now

772
01:26:28.70 --> 01:26:36.94
out there in the world. And you know, people, obviously when I made the decision with life that we

773
01:26:36.94 --> 01:26:42.54
were going to write this book, we knew that we were going to be out there and people were going

774
01:26:42.54 --> 01:26:48.14
to know us. Now the book has been more successful than, you know, it's kind of been the max level of

775
01:26:48.14 --> 01:26:51.66
success that I thought it could achieve. You know, I thought there was a spectrum and we definitely

776
01:26:51.66 --> 01:26:57.02
achieved a great success and we're super happy about that. But that means we're even more out there

777
01:26:57.90 --> 01:27:02.14
than we thought we're going to be. Then on top of that, there's been this whole

778
01:27:03.26 --> 01:27:12.30
internet phenomenon of going on the Tim Ferriss show with Tim and going on the Joe Rogan Show with Joe

779
01:27:12.94 --> 01:27:17.66
and then doing this podcast and being on Twitter and all these things, being on Facebook. I mean,

780
01:27:17.66 --> 01:27:22.38
I did literally did not have a Facebook account, literally did not have a Twitter account, never been

781
01:27:22.38 --> 01:27:29.42
on and before. And then now I have, you know, I'm on it and in it and communicating with people.

782
01:27:29.42 --> 01:27:34.86
And I think that's, you know, people would tell me like, hey, social media is cool. You can link

783
01:27:34.86 --> 01:27:41.98
up with other people. And I was definitely, I didn't want to link up with other people. I didn't want

784
01:27:41.98 --> 01:27:48.22
to have my friends and I didn't really want to make meet other people. But now that I'm there,

785
01:27:49.42 --> 01:27:55.50
it's awesome. Honestly, it's awesome to have people all over the world. I have people all over

786
01:27:55.50 --> 01:27:58.62
the world, especially because you know, I do the thing in the morning with my watch and

787
01:27:58.62 --> 01:28:02.70
have four, four, 30 in the morning. I take a picture of my watch and I post it on Twitter. And

788
01:28:03.50 --> 01:28:09.50
I get those because other people do it. And now my Twitter is filled with people from every time zone

789
01:28:09.50 --> 01:28:13.74
throughout the day that wake up at 430 in the morning and they get their workout on. And that's

790
01:28:13.74 --> 01:28:19.18
that's cool, man. That's very cool to see that there's other people in the world that have the same

791
01:28:19.18 --> 01:28:24.70
kind of mentality that want to be better, that want to improve, that want to do their best.

792
01:28:25.42 --> 01:28:30.78
And I think that's, uh, I think that's been pretty cool to see. And it's also been,

793
01:28:30.78 --> 01:28:43.58
it's, it's been, honestly, it almost makes me feel like I'm in a leadership position in a way.

794
01:28:43.58 --> 01:28:50.14
Again, because I've got like people that are saying, hey, thanks for putting this out there

795
01:28:50.14 --> 01:28:54.86
and thanks. And it makes you feel just like just like being in a leader combat leadership position,

796
01:28:55.50 --> 01:29:00.46
where you feel humbled by these guys that are doing so well. Well, I feel the same way with these

797
01:29:00.46 --> 01:29:04.22
people. I'm humbled by the fact that these people are out there and they're communicating with me

798
01:29:04.22 --> 01:29:10.38
and talking to me and saying, I inspire them. And I always write back, man, you inspire me.

799
01:29:10.38 --> 01:29:15.58
But you know, that inspires me that you're out, you know, kicking ass. And there's these, you know,

800
01:29:15.58 --> 01:29:18.70
I always talk about like the single moms, the single dads that are out there, they're getting

801
01:29:18.70 --> 01:29:22.86
up earlier than me and they're going to work. Yeah. You know, and that's job number one. And they're

802
01:29:22.86 --> 01:29:28.14
getting home late. So that's, that's inspiring to me. And I think it's been a pretty cool ride so far.

803
01:29:28.14 --> 01:29:33.74
Any other weird thing is I have no idea where the ride is going. I do. I do not know.

804
01:29:33.74 --> 01:29:38.46
And I'm all about plans and I'm a little bit of a control freak, but just to be out there and

805
01:29:38.46 --> 01:29:43.10
on this roller coaster, did you have no idea where it's going? So that's, that's pretty entertaining too.

806
01:29:43.10 --> 01:29:49.10
Yeah, to to connect with them with people who have the same interests in you and not all interests

807
01:29:49.10 --> 01:29:55.74
obviously, but just some of the same interests as you, it is kind of refreshing because if you go

808
01:29:55.74 --> 01:30:00.30
just through your day-to-day life, right? And someone as extreme as you are, it's going to be hard

809
01:30:00.30 --> 01:30:07.26
to find someone to relate to in specific ways or even in a general way. It's going to be hard

810
01:30:07.26 --> 01:30:13.26
for someone like you. Right. So when you get these little tidbits of people doing the same thing

811
01:30:13.26 --> 01:30:18.14
as you and it's like, dang, I'm relating to these people just in that small little way every day,

812
01:30:18.14 --> 01:30:22.30
or however often you check your Twitter, you know, and it's kind of refreshing and it reminds

813
01:30:22.30 --> 01:30:27.98
you that there are people like that out there, you know, who want to wake up early and be disciplined

814
01:30:27.98 --> 01:30:32.94
and work hard and then face the day and get stuff done or whatever. And you might not see that

815
01:30:32.94 --> 01:30:37.02
in your day-to-day life outside of the internet, like in your real life. You might not see that.

816
01:30:37.02 --> 01:30:41.42
So you might have this feeling of man. You might have the only one who's trying to get this stuff done,

817
01:30:41.42 --> 01:30:44.94
you know, almost like that kind of thought. Right. And I'm definitely not. Yeah.

818
01:30:44.94 --> 01:30:50.70
And it's, and you're right. It is, it is reassuring. Yeah. And it's cool to communicate with

819
01:30:50.70 --> 01:30:54.86
these people that are coming up. Got a bunch of firemen and police officers that are on there

820
01:30:54.86 --> 01:30:59.26
that are fired up every day, bunch of obviously a bunch of former military people.

821
01:30:59.26 --> 01:31:03.98
But then, you know, because I have kind of a weird background, I get these crazy old hardcore punk

822
01:31:03.98 --> 01:31:09.74
rock kids and you know, they're communicating with me and it's just, it's very interesting.

823
01:31:09.74 --> 01:31:14.22
Yeah. Very interesting. It's been an interesting ride. Like I'm curious to see where it all ends up.

824
01:31:14.22 --> 01:31:17.82
Yeah. Yeah. I do think that the more experience you have with people, the more

825
01:31:17.82 --> 01:31:24.62
good stuff you can learn that that people have in them. Regardless of stuff you might not agree

826
01:31:24.62 --> 01:31:29.58
with them. Yeah. But if you can find have more experiences with more people in whatever way,

827
01:31:29.58 --> 01:31:35.10
you'll be more informed about this. And this, this really, the fear or the

828
01:31:36.14 --> 01:31:42.94
rejection I had of social media was based on what I talked about earlier with that Tom Wolf

829
01:31:42.94 --> 01:31:52.70
book, The Electric Cool A Dacet Test. Me, me, me, me. And I always felt that social media was me,

830
01:31:52.70 --> 01:31:58.78
me, here's a picture of me, here's me doing this, here's my food and this is my car and this is

831
01:31:58.78 --> 01:32:07.02
me, me, me and it just felt so disturbing. And but now I, like you're saying, I realize that

832
01:32:07.02 --> 01:32:14.38
this, this social media, at least the way that I'm involved in it right now, it's not about me.

833
01:32:15.10 --> 01:32:22.22
It's about we. And there's a group of people that have the similar mindset and some of them are

834
01:32:22.22 --> 01:32:27.90
more into it, some of them aren't, but they're there. And they communicate with me and it's not me,

835
01:32:27.90 --> 01:32:33.34
it's we. And I think that's, that's pretty cool. Yeah, for sure. Well, it is everything. It's a

836
01:32:33.34 --> 01:32:39.74
spectrum, but I think I think we all feel that even if we're people who are really into the internet,

837
01:32:39.74 --> 01:32:47.98
really into Facebook, really into Twitter and Instagram, if people overdo it, me, me, here's a

838
01:32:47.98 --> 01:32:54.78
selfie of me in front of the mirror. If you see 10 pictures of them taking a picture of them,

839
01:32:54.78 --> 01:32:58.86
self in front of the mirror, that's a me, me, me, me, you're looking for sure. But they're just on that

840
01:32:58.86 --> 01:33:04.46
side of the spectrum. That's all. There's all kinds of different people. And I think the majority

841
01:33:04.46 --> 01:33:10.70
people are in that we, we category. Yeah. Sure, it's something about me, but there is no we without

842
01:33:10.70 --> 01:33:18.06
me too. Yeah. No, it's cool. I don't like people that send me stuff on Twitter. I get pictures every

843
01:33:18.06 --> 01:33:23.34
day of people's watches. I get pictures of their jump rope or their kettlebell. Like no one said,

844
01:33:23.34 --> 01:33:28.30
I don't know what any of these people look like, which I guess is kind of bizarre. And, but that's

845
01:33:28.30 --> 01:33:32.62
you're right. They're not about me, me, me, they're about we and we're like having a little,

846
01:33:33.26 --> 01:33:38.38
little group, little gang. You don't get after it. Yeah, I sent you a picture of me and it wasn't

847
01:33:38.38 --> 01:33:42.22
for 30, it was more like noon. It's for 30 minutes after it. Actually, it was like two p.a.

848
01:33:46.14 --> 01:33:52.14
So, you're sleeping next question. You're sleeping routine. You get less than eight hours sleep.

849
01:33:52.14 --> 01:33:56.54
Yes. From what I know. Okay. So, you're sleeping routine. How many hours sleep do you get? And what

850
01:33:56.54 --> 01:34:02.22
are the techniques you used to get to sleep if you're not tired? Do you know, do you

851
01:34:02.22 --> 01:34:10.30
take naps? Do that? Does that work? Okay. So, I generally sleep. I try and sleep at least five,

852
01:34:11.10 --> 01:34:16.70
five and a half or six hours a night. It generally ends up being somewhere between five and five

853
01:34:16.70 --> 01:34:27.66
and a half. Generally, I feel not good if I sleep for, you know, seven hours. I don't feel good.

854
01:34:27.66 --> 01:34:35.74
I feel groggy. I don't know why that is. That's the way it is though. I feel good. And sometimes,

855
01:34:35.74 --> 01:34:41.18
I feel better when I slept four point five hours. Otherwise, known as four and a half hours.

856
01:34:41.18 --> 01:34:51.90
So, so, so there's no doubt that I don't need a ton of sleep. That being said, sometimes,

857
01:34:52.46 --> 01:34:58.78
I do feel tired. Sometimes, you know, come the afternoon, especially if I have to do something

858
01:35:00.30 --> 01:35:05.18
boring or tedious. And that's when I'll feel really legitimately tired. If I'm uping moving,

859
01:35:05.18 --> 01:35:10.38
I don't need to sleep. I actually don't need to sleep. Like, I can go long periods of times without

860
01:35:10.38 --> 01:35:15.34
sleeping. If there's something actively engaging my mind, especially something that's got to be

861
01:35:15.34 --> 01:35:19.90
partially physical. You know, because you sit now and reading a book when you're tired is tough. So,

862
01:35:22.14 --> 01:35:28.22
I do and power naps are great. And this is something that I learned part of it in high school

863
01:35:28.22 --> 01:35:35.74
and part of it in basic seal training. When I was in high school, my anatomy and physiology teacher,

864
01:35:35.74 --> 01:35:41.02
I used to go and walk by his room at lunchtime and he'd be in there with his feet up on the desk

865
01:35:41.02 --> 01:35:45.18
in like his chair on low. And he'd just be in there sitting, you know, doing a little bit of work.

866
01:35:45.98 --> 01:35:49.74
And one day I said, hey, you know, you look kind of relaxed in there and he said, hey,

867
01:35:50.62 --> 01:35:55.58
this is a technique and I said, what do you mean? He said, put when you when you rest, elevate your

868
01:35:55.58 --> 01:36:01.18
feet above your heart. Because your veins are stressed out, you know, the one way valve isn't

869
01:36:01.18 --> 01:36:05.90
your veins. You've got blood pulled up in areas in your feet. You want to get that stuff out of there.

870
01:36:05.90 --> 01:36:11.10
So elevate your feet above your heart. And I was like, well, that makes sense. Then in seal training,

871
01:36:11.74 --> 01:36:17.90
you'd come back from, let's say, breakfast in the morning or lunch. And you get back to the barracks.

872
01:36:17.90 --> 01:36:21.74
You have to grab gear to get ready for whatever the next evolution was going to be. Well,

873
01:36:21.74 --> 01:36:25.42
they'd give you time to grab the gear, but they'd also give you time to, you know, use the bath

874
01:36:25.42 --> 01:36:29.82
for a mortal or whatever. And it would literally be, they'd say, all right, we got to be back out

875
01:36:29.82 --> 01:36:33.82
her in eight minutes. Well, it took you one minute to get your gear down. So if I didn't have to go

876
01:36:33.82 --> 01:36:38.70
the bathroom, I would go in my room. I would lay down on the floor. I'd put my feet up on the bed.

877
01:36:38.70 --> 01:36:45.18
And I would set my alarm clock for six minutes. And I would get a power nap and you'd fall sleep almost

878
01:36:45.18 --> 01:36:51.02
immediately because you're so tired. So you'd just fall sleep six minutes later, boom, you wake up

879
01:36:51.02 --> 01:36:56.22
and you feel refreshed and you feel refreshed and you feel refreshed. If you sleep for longer than that,

880
01:36:56.22 --> 01:37:01.58
sometimes you start to feel groggy again. So you got to be careful that you don't sleep for too long,

881
01:37:01.58 --> 01:37:10.54
but yeah, try the elevated feet above the heart eight minute power nap when you're feeling tired

882
01:37:10.54 --> 01:37:15.98
and it'll make you feel better. You got to set your alarm clock so you don't, so that eight minutes

883
01:37:15.98 --> 01:37:24.86
doesn't turn into two. And that's it, you know, I look, I know and probably I know I should

884
01:37:24.86 --> 01:37:29.50
probably sleep more and I would like to do that. I'll try and do that sometimes.

885
01:37:31.26 --> 01:37:40.06
But also my mind, it's not like a big choice that I'm making. You know, when I'm thinking about

886
01:37:40.06 --> 01:37:46.54
something, it cannot be stopped. It cannot be stopped. When I'm thinking about something, it just goes.

887
01:37:46.54 --> 01:37:55.58
And in my mind, it feels like I'm going down various tunnels of thought. That's literally what

888
01:37:55.58 --> 01:37:58.94
it feels like I'm going down these various tunnels of thought and one leads to another. I'm taking

889
01:37:58.94 --> 01:38:02.78
a left turn, right turn, I'm getting all these ideas and I can't sleep. Yeah. So,

890
01:38:05.66 --> 01:38:10.94
you know. Yeah, and I would imagine that a lot of people are like that where if they have a lot

891
01:38:10.94 --> 01:38:14.46
going on in their life, you know, where they can't get these certain thoughts out of the head,

892
01:38:14.46 --> 01:38:18.14
go to bed. You know, sometimes you're just excited about something and you can't stop thinking

893
01:38:18.14 --> 01:38:24.14
about it and you know, whatever. But if that's a problem, if you get in the way you're sleeping

894
01:38:24.14 --> 01:38:29.10
at its jam and you up the next day, then I'm sure you can, you know, I'm sure meditation can kind

895
01:38:29.10 --> 01:38:34.46
of help is from what I hear about meditation. Yeah, maybe I don't know. But I will say this.

896
01:38:34.86 --> 01:38:40.86
If you want to go to bed earlier, you have to get up earlier. Like it doesn't work in reverse.

897
01:38:40.86 --> 01:38:44.14
You can't just force yourself to go to sleep at night. You have to just wake up earlier and be

898
01:38:44.14 --> 01:38:48.46
more tired at the end of the day. Yeah. And I love the feeling of when I'm so tired that my

899
01:38:48.46 --> 01:38:54.06
my head hits the pillow and I fall asleep immediately. I love that feeling. Yeah. Just exhaustion.

900
01:38:54.06 --> 01:39:00.14
That's what I'm going for every day. See if I can just burn it out and just be so tired at the end of the day.

901
01:39:02.22 --> 01:39:07.90
So that's my sleep routine. Probably I made all kinds of doctors and stuff. Angry at me. Sorry.

902
01:39:07.90 --> 01:39:14.86
Sorry, Doc Parsley. I know. Like, I think they say that the ideal amount of sleep is

903
01:39:14.86 --> 01:39:19.10
seven and a half hours or something like that. But I would imagine it'd be different from person.

904
01:39:19.10 --> 01:39:23.02
Like if you're used to getting six hours sleep, doesn't your body conform? Like,

905
01:39:23.02 --> 01:39:26.62
you know, your sleep cycles. I think they conform to that six hours that they have.

906
01:39:26.62 --> 01:39:32.54
Doctor, Dr. Eko has spoken. Yeah. Your sleep schedule can form. I learned that from the internet.

907
01:39:32.54 --> 01:39:40.14
So, in regards to, you know, achieving goals and just your pursuits in life. How do you deal

908
01:39:41.58 --> 01:39:46.86
with loved ones who seem to determine or who seem determined to hold you back from their goals?

909
01:39:48.14 --> 01:39:52.46
And that's, I guess that's kind of assuming that you have loved ones that are determined to hold

910
01:39:52.46 --> 01:39:58.46
you back from your sleep. Yeah. That's a well, that, you know, an issue. This is one of those

911
01:39:58.46 --> 01:40:03.90
questions that came in and I think you voted positive on this question was let's answer this question.

912
01:40:03.90 --> 01:40:07.02
And why did you, why were you so, why did you want to answer this question? Because,

913
01:40:07.02 --> 01:40:11.26
and not that I had this experience. Whoever you were that answered this question or that asked this

914
01:40:11.26 --> 01:40:16.38
question, I put a line through it, Eko brought it back from the dead. So, okay, yeah.

915
01:40:16.38 --> 01:40:22.78
Also, I think people deal with this. I don't, I haven't experienced this personally, but

916
01:40:22.78 --> 01:40:28.06
I've seen it happen. I've seen it in other people. Yeah. Where, and I think

917
01:40:29.82 --> 01:40:34.70
part of this is just my philosophy, but I think a big part of this, I believe, a big part of this

918
01:40:34.70 --> 01:40:41.50
is you can apply it to every situation where it's a supposed loved one, whether it be your

919
01:40:41.50 --> 01:40:48.86
family, spouse, whatever, where they will hold you back, sometimes. And

920
01:40:48.86 --> 01:40:55.82
sometimes it can be because they're like jealous of you or something. So, and not necessarily

921
01:40:55.82 --> 01:41:01.26
jealous, so they're going to say, you know, they're going to lie to you and say, hey, that's a bad

922
01:41:01.26 --> 01:41:06.46
idea when it's really a good one or nothing like that. They'll just be focusing on the bad part

923
01:41:06.46 --> 01:41:13.18
of it. So, let's say, let's say, you were unemployed for a little bit, you've been working hard

924
01:41:13.18 --> 01:41:18.70
to get this job and you finally get a job. And then you're, I don't know, a parent or whatever says,

925
01:41:18.70 --> 01:41:24.30
well, it's about time. You know? So, instead of dang, you know, you got this job

926
01:41:24.30 --> 01:41:29.98
congratulations, they focus on the negative. And that can be discouraging on a personal level.

927
01:41:29.98 --> 01:41:37.10
Like, like, there was no happiness. There was no encouragement. There was no no one saying

928
01:41:38.06 --> 01:41:42.70
that no one making me feel like they were on my team and making me feel like I'm alone in doing this.

929
01:41:42.70 --> 01:41:46.54
People do that. And then they do a bunch of other stuff as well, telling you, the other part

930
01:41:46.54 --> 01:41:50.62
that I said, they will tell you it's a bad idea to start this new company. You know, because

931
01:41:50.62 --> 01:41:55.50
they may be afraid to subconsciously or whatever that, you know, you might outshine them or you might

932
01:41:55.50 --> 01:41:59.34
do something good when they haven't done anything good. So, yes. So, how do you deal with that?

933
01:42:00.06 --> 01:42:05.98
And of course, a bunch of other ways that they can kind of get in the way. This probably isn't going

934
01:42:05.98 --> 01:42:12.62
to be anything new, but, you know, how you surround yourself with like nine people or you surround

935
01:42:12.62 --> 01:42:17.82
yourself by a certain types of people and you're going to start to become like that. So, I'm not

936
01:42:17.82 --> 01:42:23.34
saying disown any family members or loved ones and not saying that, but you have to create

937
01:42:24.38 --> 01:42:30.94
boundaries, specific boundaries to these people. And I know a lot of people say, well, that's my

938
01:42:30.94 --> 01:42:35.82
family and I can't change that or that's my family. So, you know, and they feel like they're

939
01:42:35.82 --> 01:42:42.46
under this obligation to essentially give away part of their life. But I think it should be

940
01:42:42.46 --> 01:42:47.34
the opposite. I think that that's your family. So, they should understand that you're on a path

941
01:42:47.34 --> 01:42:52.94
to success or you want to be on a path to success. And if they're in the way, then they're in the way

942
01:42:52.94 --> 01:42:57.74
and those boundaries have to be created. If they can't handle that, then there is someone who

943
01:42:58.62 --> 01:43:06.14
is against you in your path. And if you're on a successful path and someone is against you,

944
01:43:06.14 --> 01:43:12.06
just that the eventuality is that they're going to be cut out of your life. And if they can

945
01:43:12.06 --> 01:43:16.06
respect the boundaries and boom, you can keep women in your life and they can be them and you can

946
01:43:16.06 --> 01:43:20.46
I love them for them, no matter how negative they're and you can have all that. But if you don't,

947
01:43:20.46 --> 01:43:24.38
they're either going to bring you down or you got to come out, cut them out of your life. Family

948
01:43:24.38 --> 01:43:31.10
or not, I think family should be held in a higher standard than your friend or whatever,

949
01:43:31.10 --> 01:43:35.58
because they're your family. They're the one who should be treating you good. So, you're saying

950
01:43:35.58 --> 01:43:39.74
your loved ones are treating you bad. They're the ones that should, they're the last people that

951
01:43:39.74 --> 01:43:43.26
should be treating you bad. They're your loved ones. So, if they're not treating you good,

952
01:43:44.22 --> 01:43:51.10
then like I said, they're the one in violation. Not you for pursuing your path and, you know,

953
01:43:51.90 --> 01:43:56.06
and not giving them the attention or not going to their house every other Saturday or whatever,

954
01:43:56.06 --> 01:43:59.58
like you're supposed to or whatever, it's their fault or not their fault. But it's

955
01:44:00.62 --> 01:44:05.02
their responsibility to support you. And if they're not, then like anyone else who's not supporting

956
01:44:05.02 --> 01:44:09.10
you, they should either have a boundary between you and them or you could have your life.

957
01:44:10.86 --> 01:44:19.74
I think that's fairly sound advice. I'll tell you that a couple things from my perspective

958
01:44:21.10 --> 01:44:31.34
first of all, I think that many people are negative in the world. And to coin a term that is used

959
01:44:31.34 --> 01:44:37.50
very often these days. A lot of people are haters and they don't want you to succeed and we would

960
01:44:37.50 --> 01:44:40.86
see that, we'd even see that in the sealed teams because sealed teams is a bunch of really

961
01:44:40.86 --> 01:44:46.86
super competitive guys and everybody is competitive with each other and when someone starts doing

962
01:44:46.86 --> 01:44:52.78
something well, other people get, can get jealous of them pretty quickly. And so that like I had one

963
01:44:52.78 --> 01:45:01.26
friend of mine who he decided that hey he was going to try and take like a year off or get get orders

964
01:45:01.26 --> 01:45:09.34
to go to an Ivy League school while he was in the sealed teams. And he had applied and actually got

965
01:45:09.34 --> 01:45:16.14
into one of the best colleges in the world to go there for a year and get it to agree. And

966
01:45:17.26 --> 01:45:22.54
you know, that's awesome. And he came to me and he said hey you know I've got some guys that are

967
01:45:22.54 --> 01:45:26.06
telling me I shouldn't do this. It's going to be bad for my career and this is that the other thing

968
01:45:26.06 --> 01:45:34.30
and I said bro. I hate to tell you this. These guys are just their haters. They're just jealous.

969
01:45:34.30 --> 01:45:37.26
The fact that you thought of this, the fact that you went on a limb, the fact that you made this

970
01:45:37.26 --> 01:45:41.58
happen, the fact that you put in an application, the fact that you took the test to get into the school.

971
01:45:41.58 --> 01:45:46.46
And now you're going to go there. You're going to have that on your resume, which is awesome.

972
01:45:46.46 --> 01:45:53.26
You know what? Don't worry about anybody else. They're just, you know, I hate to use the word

973
01:45:53.26 --> 01:45:56.30
jealous, but they're jealous. The fact that you're going to go out and make this happen, which I

974
01:45:56.30 --> 01:46:02.46
thought was, I thought that was awesome. The other kind of contrary advice to what you just said

975
01:46:03.34 --> 01:46:10.38
is when people aren't approving what you're doing and they're saying negative things to you

976
01:46:10.38 --> 01:46:17.90
and they're not giving you the praise that you want for your what you're doing. That's your fault.

977
01:46:17.90 --> 01:46:21.42
You're the one that's wanting praise. You're the one that's looking for approval. You're the one

978
01:46:21.42 --> 01:46:26.22
that wants all the support. Like no, I don't expect anything from anybody because people are crazy

979
01:46:26.22 --> 01:46:30.46
as I briefed earlier. And they're not going to give you support. If they're one of these people that are

980
01:46:30.46 --> 01:46:35.26
negative, they're going to be negative no matter what you do. So you can't be

981
01:46:35.26 --> 01:46:40.30
hung up on getting their approval and getting their support. You go forth and conquer regardless

982
01:46:40.30 --> 01:46:44.22
of what people are trying to do to told you back. I was going to hold you back because you're

983
01:46:44.22 --> 01:46:49.50
holding you back. How's that going to happen? It don't let them hold you back. Yeah, and I agree with

984
01:46:49.50 --> 01:46:53.66
that last time where you don't let them hold you, but hold you back. But here, here's an example. Let's say

985
01:46:55.74 --> 01:47:00.62
let's say you're pursuing this, I don't know, business degree or something or you're, you want to

986
01:47:00.62 --> 01:47:06.22
start a T-shirt company. And it takes all this time. You got to really get your knowledge down and

987
01:47:06.22 --> 01:47:10.86
you really do all your research and stuff. And it takes a lot of time. Let's say it takes 15 hours a day,

988
01:47:10.86 --> 01:47:18.22
every single day while you're getting this thing up and running. But you visit your mom on the weekends

989
01:47:18.78 --> 01:47:23.50
typically. And you go down there, you help her with your her yard work, just because she wants

990
01:47:23.50 --> 01:47:28.62
company, you know, you do all this stuff. If you don't, she makes you feel guilty, you know, if you

991
01:47:28.62 --> 01:47:32.94
can't make it or, I don't know, your sick or something, she makes you feel guilty. So you're under this

992
01:47:32.94 --> 01:47:39.66
oddly, and when you grow up, it kind of gets ingrained into you, you know, like these relationships

993
01:47:39.66 --> 01:47:45.74
with your loved ones. And not to mention, they're your loved ones. They're supposed to love you,

994
01:47:45.74 --> 01:47:50.46
you know, and you're supposed to love them. Okay. So I think you do care about the support. I

995
01:47:50.46 --> 01:47:55.34
think that's a natural part of it. If that's your loved ones, I'm not saying like your friend

996
01:47:55.34 --> 01:48:00.30
or your neighbors, not recognizing my, my successor, whatever. That's your loved ones. Typically,

997
01:48:00.30 --> 01:48:04.46
that's if anyone's going to praise you, you're going to hope that they're the first ones.

998
01:48:04.46 --> 01:48:08.70
Yeah, but you can't be hung up on it, especially if they're crazy.

999
01:48:09.74 --> 01:48:14.22
Right. And that's my point. That was your point. Yeah. So accepted. So you say,

1000
01:48:14.22 --> 01:48:20.22
you, that's how they can hold you back. If it's ingrained in you that you have to be there for

1001
01:48:20.22 --> 01:48:25.98
you mom, if she's trained you from a little kid to be to say, you owe me, I gave you love. Then

1002
01:48:25.98 --> 01:48:28.86
again, that's your fault. If you're letting them hold you back, then that's your fault.

1003
01:48:28.86 --> 01:48:33.26
Right. You take ownership of it and move on. Yes. So yeah, exactly right. And that's what I mean by

1004
01:48:33.26 --> 01:48:38.70
you create those barriers. Yeah. You have to suck it up or kind of mind in your life. And how

1005
01:48:38.70 --> 01:48:44.38
you would say about, um, about other people or other situations when you're in the job or

1006
01:48:44.38 --> 01:48:48.38
a leadership situation where you can make them understand, if you can make them understand what you're

1007
01:48:48.38 --> 01:48:53.82
doing, that's ideal where you can maintain the intensity of the, you are correct. Now you just

1008
01:48:53.82 --> 01:48:57.74
hit a home run because you're going back to the basic principles. You have to let people understand

1009
01:48:57.74 --> 01:49:01.82
why and you have to make them understand why it's going to be beneficial for them in the long run.

1010
01:49:01.82 --> 01:49:08.86
You know, you used to dealing with guys when we were working hard, you know, training guys for combat

1011
01:49:08.86 --> 01:49:13.42
or we were training for combat and you think, oh, well, you know, you got to let these guys

1012
01:49:13.42 --> 01:49:16.54
get home to their families. You know, they got to get home tonight. Let's let them out early and

1013
01:49:16.54 --> 01:49:20.62
I'd say, look, the best thing we can do for these guys to help them and their families is to train

1014
01:49:20.62 --> 01:49:24.30
them as hard as possible. So in the long run, when they come home from combat, that's what we're here

1015
01:49:24.30 --> 01:49:29.58
to do. Yeah. And everybody understands that message. So it's the same thing you're right. When you explain

1016
01:49:29.58 --> 01:49:33.90
to your family members, this is why I'm doing what I'm doing. This is how it's going to benefit

1017
01:49:33.90 --> 01:49:38.86
me, which will thereby benefit you, which will thereby benefit our whole family. Yes, that is correct.

1018
01:49:39.90 --> 01:49:41.74
Explain the why. What up?

1019
01:49:41.74 --> 01:49:55.66
Next question. What is the, what are the bullet points and keys to success for motivating

1020
01:49:55.66 --> 01:50:01.66
and engaging your team of leaders? Well, first of all, we just kind of covered that when we talked

1021
01:50:01.66 --> 01:50:08.54
with about about face for a solid hour, which is, which is one of the questions here. I actually

1022
01:50:08.54 --> 01:50:12.06
answered this question last time. So this is a question that you hear all the time. Is, you know,

1023
01:50:12.06 --> 01:50:17.98
what kind of you to motivate these guys? How can we get them engaged? And first of all, I want to say that

1024
01:50:19.42 --> 01:50:25.26
leadership, although there are basic principles, fundamental principles that can be used,

1025
01:50:25.98 --> 01:50:32.54
it is not something that can be bulletized. It is like trying to bulletize how you play guitar,

1026
01:50:32.54 --> 01:50:39.42
or trying to bulletize how you play the violin. It is an art. It is a practice. And there are

1027
01:50:39.42 --> 01:50:44.86
many, many different ways to manipulate that instrument, to make it make the noise that you want

1028
01:50:44.86 --> 01:50:50.54
to make. And that's what leadership is. Leadership is not follow these four steps and you will

1029
01:50:50.54 --> 01:50:55.90
become a good leader. It doesn't work that way. It is an art. Now, again, just like there's principles

1030
01:50:55.90 --> 01:51:01.26
behind music, there's principles behind leadership and that fundamental principles stay the same.

1031
01:51:01.26 --> 01:51:10.06
But how you engage with those and the nuances involved in executing those principles is what makes

1032
01:51:10.06 --> 01:51:16.06
leadership so challenging. Which again, is why we have a book, which is why we have a business,

1033
01:51:16.06 --> 01:51:20.46
which is why there's leadership schools around the world because it is a very challenging thing to do.

1034
01:51:21.10 --> 01:51:26.94
So, you know, the bullets are, I almost, after saying that, you know, what are the bullets? Well,

1035
01:51:26.94 --> 01:51:30.06
you got to build relationships. You got to listen to people. You got to give respect. You got to

1036
01:51:30.06 --> 01:51:33.90
the main thing we talked about tonight with about face. You got to answer that. Why? People

1037
01:51:33.90 --> 01:51:39.26
got to understand why you're doing what you're doing. And understand what their perspective is.

1038
01:51:39.26 --> 01:51:45.98
So, you got to communicate with them. It's all those things. But I think it's important to realize

1039
01:51:45.98 --> 01:51:52.86
that leadership is a learning, a constant learning process. It's a nuanced tool. There aren't any

1040
01:51:52.86 --> 01:51:57.18
bulletized lists that are going to make you into a great leader tomorrow. What there are are

1041
01:51:57.18 --> 01:52:02.38
principles that you can learn and understand and interpret and apply in different ways with different

1042
01:52:02.94 --> 01:52:09.42
amplitudes at different times with different personalities. It's mayhem. It's mayhem. That's what makes

1043
01:52:09.42 --> 01:52:14.86
it so challenging and so fun. And I, well, that's what makes me love to talk about leadership. Because

1044
01:52:14.86 --> 01:52:23.34
there's, it's an infinitely complex thing on in so many different ways. But all that being said,

1045
01:52:23.34 --> 01:52:29.50
it is something that does follow core principles. And so, learn those core principles. No,

1046
01:52:29.50 --> 01:52:35.18
those core principles. And that's what will make you good leader. But don't look for a quick solution.

1047
01:52:35.82 --> 01:52:47.18
Look for a comprehensive, a comprehensive mass of knowledge and technique and understanding

1048
01:52:47.18 --> 01:52:58.54
that will make you a better leader. In your opinion, what are the best tactics in order to

1049
01:52:58.54 --> 01:53:06.14
remain focused? Okay. This is individual for me because I know different people have different techniques.

1050
01:53:06.14 --> 01:53:10.70
If you're, if you're using whatever techniques you have and they're not working well,

1051
01:53:10.70 --> 01:53:17.26
then they're not working. So, try mine. So, my, no, when I have to do something focused,

1052
01:53:18.38 --> 01:53:23.50
no music, no video, no TV playing in the background, none of that. No phone,

1053
01:53:24.46 --> 01:53:29.82
turn that off and get focused on the task at hand. So, what are you going to do to focus on the task

1054
01:53:29.82 --> 01:53:36.94
at hand? You have to pre-determine. There's a thing we used to use in the seal-teams. It's called

1055
01:53:36.94 --> 01:53:42.94
task-condition standard. Here's the task. Here's the conditions that are involved in the task.

1056
01:53:42.94 --> 01:53:48.94
And here's the standards that you have to complete the task, too. So, I like to think of when

1057
01:53:48.94 --> 01:53:54.46
I have to focus on something, I set up my own task conditions and standards for it. And a good

1058
01:53:54.46 --> 01:53:59.82
example for me was writing our book. When we were writing extreme ownership, lay for wrote about

1059
01:53:59.82 --> 01:54:03.82
half of it, I wrote about half of it. We actually wrote a little bit more of half of each because we

1060
01:54:03.82 --> 01:54:10.06
both wrote chapters that aren't in there. But it was a lot of writing to do. And how do you do that?

1061
01:54:10.06 --> 01:54:16.22
How did I do it? I'll tell you. I set the task conditions and standards for what I need to do.

1062
01:54:17.02 --> 01:54:23.90
For me, it was what I had to do. The task was to write. The condition was I was trying to write

1063
01:54:23.90 --> 01:54:27.58
the draft. So, I knew it didn't have to be perfect and I got perfect out of my head because

1064
01:54:27.58 --> 01:54:34.22
perfect can be bad. And the standard was I set every damn, read a thousand words, regardless.

1065
01:54:34.22 --> 01:54:39.02
I read a thousand words and I tried to do it in an hour or less. So, that's what I did.

1066
01:54:39.90 --> 01:54:46.22
I made no music, no phone, no videos playing in the background. I have an hour. I'm going to sit

1067
01:54:46.22 --> 01:54:50.46
down. I'm going to get this done. So, to me, that's a form of motivation. When you say, okay,

1068
01:54:50.46 --> 01:54:53.02
this is what I'm going to do. This is how I'm going to do it. This is how long it's going to

1069
01:54:53.02 --> 01:54:56.06
take me. I'm going to get it done. I'm probably going to try and get it done faster than an hour.

1070
01:54:56.06 --> 01:54:59.82
And I used to time myself and do that. I don't want to took me, you know, 49 minutes. That's

1071
01:54:59.82 --> 01:55:03.50
pretty good. Kind of like a crossfit exercise. Yeah. Like you're going into it. I'm going to

1072
01:55:03.50 --> 01:55:12.78
with a challenge. And then you go about it in a disciplined way. And that's going to be the core

1073
01:55:12.78 --> 01:55:21.50
of a lot of answers I give. Yeah. I think I'm going to disagree on a personal level from a personal

1074
01:55:21.50 --> 01:55:27.98
standpoint. I mean, with the no music thing, I think the music in my case helps. I think for a lot

1075
01:55:27.98 --> 01:55:34.06
of people, music helps. It might, when I talk specifically about writing, then music does not help me.

1076
01:55:34.06 --> 01:55:42.22
Especially music with words. Like if there's lyrics, you know, but if it's like, um, like some

1077
01:55:42.22 --> 01:55:49.34
piano or something like that. Okay. That's yeah. Echo, your are clear to listen piano as you create.

1078
01:55:49.34 --> 01:55:54.38
Okay. Some violins, Marcus, I think that would work too. For cello.

1079
01:55:59.42 --> 01:56:06.54
Any, was there more to the one? No. That was correct. I'm good. Any advice on balancing the

1080
01:56:06.54 --> 01:56:12.30
thousands of things you have to do every day? Yeah. Again, chapter in the book, it's called

1081
01:56:12.30 --> 01:56:17.82
Prioritized and excut, Prioritized and execute. That is the name of the chapter. That is a

1082
01:56:17.82 --> 01:56:21.82
one of the basic principles, one of the laws of combat that we used and that is that you're

1083
01:56:21.82 --> 01:56:25.90
going to have all these problems happening on the battlefield. They're all going to happen at the

1084
01:56:25.90 --> 01:56:32.22
same time because Murphy's Law. And when they do, if you try and handle them all at once and you try

1085
01:56:32.22 --> 01:56:37.18
and do them on all at once, you will fail. So what you have to do is you have to prioritize them

1086
01:56:37.18 --> 01:56:43.02
and execute. So in business that looks the same way. You got to these problems, though, these,

1087
01:56:43.02 --> 01:56:47.26
you know, initiatives that you're trying to start, these things you've got to handle and that's

1088
01:56:48.78 --> 01:56:53.26
that's good and that looks very similar on the battlefield on a personal level. It's the same

1089
01:56:53.26 --> 01:57:04.14
principle. But I'll tell you what I consider to be for lack of a better word, I will use this word.

1090
01:57:04.14 --> 01:57:14.86
I will tell you the hack for this. And this is no genius thing here. If you really want to get

1091
01:57:14.86 --> 01:57:22.94
things done, make a list of what you need to do the next day, make it in a priority. What you

1092
01:57:22.94 --> 01:57:29.02
actually need to do is schedule the time that you're going to execute those tasks. This is a piece

1093
01:57:29.02 --> 01:57:36.30
that a lot of people miss. So I guess it is a little bit bigger of a hack than then I gave it credit

1094
01:57:36.30 --> 01:57:42.06
for. You have to say, okay, I've got to do these six things tomorrow. You've got to put on your

1095
01:57:42.06 --> 01:57:49.18
schedule when you are going to do those things. And that really drives execution because it puts a

1096
01:57:49.18 --> 01:57:53.90
time limit on it and it makes you get on there and get it started and get it done so you can move

1097
01:57:53.90 --> 01:58:02.94
onto the next task. So taskless and calendars should actually be connected, you know, intimately.

1098
01:58:04.22 --> 01:58:08.06
And then once you have that in place, you get up and you go and you get it done.

1099
01:58:08.86 --> 01:58:13.34
Wake up early and make it happen. Prioritize and execute. That's what we do.

1100
01:58:13.34 --> 01:58:30.54
New Year's resolutions. 2016 is coming up in a few days. So what's your one thing for 2016

1101
01:58:31.50 --> 01:58:37.26
that you need to do such that by doing it, everything else will be easier and or unnecessary.

1102
01:58:37.26 --> 01:58:42.62
And that's one of the New Year's resolution questions that we pulled out because I got a bunch of them.

1103
01:58:43.34 --> 01:58:47.66
Because everyone's thinking, you know, what is what are we all going to do for the big New Year's

1104
01:58:47.66 --> 01:58:55.58
resolution? And I mean, you seem pretty fired up by the New Year's resolution. So so what are your

1105
01:58:55.58 --> 01:59:03.50
thoughts here? My personal New Year's resolution and or thoughts therein.

1106
01:59:03.50 --> 01:59:10.46
I've, you know, I'm be honest. I haven't come up with any specific ones right now.

1107
01:59:11.66 --> 01:59:19.66
Maybe I will, maybe I won't, but I think yeah, I think all evaluate where I want to be, where I am.

1108
01:59:19.66 --> 01:59:27.26
And let's see if I can connect those dots. Whatever that looks like, okay, you know, I don't know yet,

1109
01:59:27.26 --> 01:59:35.58
but we'll see. Well, that sounds real hard. Anyone that just heard that in the world,

1110
01:59:37.58 --> 01:59:44.94
please ignore and delete from your mind. Okay, well, actually here's the funny thing.

1111
01:59:45.74 --> 01:59:49.02
As I think that resolutions are for the most part,

1112
01:59:49.02 --> 01:59:58.70
little feel good statements that people use to justify a delay in execution. That's what I think.

1113
01:59:58.70 --> 02:00:05.66
So I say, don't make a New Year's resolution for tomorrow. Don't execute then.

1114
02:00:05.66 --> 02:00:15.90
Execute now. Execute now. And when I say execute now, I mean now and now and now and now and

1115
02:00:15.90 --> 02:00:21.42
continually execute what it is you're trying to do. And the other thing about New Year's resolution is

1116
02:00:21.42 --> 02:00:30.70
it's a year. That's a big long chunk of time. And that type of goal to anybody. I don't care who you are.

1117
02:00:30.70 --> 02:00:34.62
A year is too long. It's too big of a chunk. So saying that you're going to

1118
02:00:35.90 --> 02:00:41.26
make that type of a long term strategic goal. It's like shooting when you shoot. If you ever shot weapons

1119
02:00:41.26 --> 02:00:48.78
before, if you look at the target, the long target that's 400 meters away, if you look at the target

1120
02:00:48.78 --> 02:00:53.90
as you look at it, your vision can't hold that focus and it becomes blurry. So you have to shift back

1121
02:00:53.90 --> 02:00:58.94
to the front side of your weapon, which is only two and a half feet away. And then that becomes very

1122
02:00:58.94 --> 02:01:03.02
clear and the long distance target in the background fades a little bit, but that's okay,

1123
02:01:03.02 --> 02:01:06.62
because you can see that thing right in front of you. And that's what you want to make happen.

1124
02:01:06.62 --> 02:01:15.18
So what you want to do is you want to set those short terms goals that are closer than a year away.

1125
02:01:15.18 --> 02:01:18.94
That's going to be blurry and it's going to lose its impact and you're going to not see it anymore.

1126
02:01:19.90 --> 02:01:24.94
So make up that long term strategic goal that's fine, but make sure you make some short term

1127
02:01:24.94 --> 02:01:33.82
tactical goals that are closer. Now that being said, to close this out since the last question

1128
02:01:33.82 --> 02:01:43.82
I would say, don't make a new year's resolution to be a better person in 2016.

1129
02:01:45.02 --> 02:01:48.30
I would say make a resolution to be a better person now.

1130
02:01:50.38 --> 02:01:57.34
Make it a resolution of discipline to get better, smarter, faster, stronger, healthier,

1131
02:01:57.34 --> 02:02:09.74
more productive, less agitated to eat cleaner, live more, to go and do. Do all those things,

1132
02:02:10.86 --> 02:02:14.54
but don't do them on New Year's Eve, don't do them on New Year's Day, do them now.

1133
02:02:14.54 --> 02:02:26.70
That resolution of discipline to work and follow through and maintain your will.

1134
02:02:28.94 --> 02:02:34.06
That'll result in the freedom that you're looking for.

1135
02:02:35.58 --> 02:02:39.18
Yes, you heard it once again. Discipline equals freedom.

1136
02:02:39.18 --> 02:02:52.06
And with that, that's all I got. Thank you, Mr. Eckeau. Thank you. Everyone that's out there listening.

1137
02:02:52.06 --> 02:02:55.26
We appreciate it. We will see you next time.

1138
02:02:55.26 --> 02:03:08.70
Keep getting better.
