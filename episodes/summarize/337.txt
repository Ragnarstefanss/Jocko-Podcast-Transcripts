and then the exo's Sealteen Iraq deployment though um so come back and and for for everybody listening we're really good about succession planning and the Seals you know you once you're in the seat a seat for two or three years you're thinking how you have to get out of your seat and make room for the next guy and we do these diversity tours I was fortunate my first diversity tour was you know graduate school for two years in Cambridge mass and it was time for me to get out of my chair as the exo is Sealteen 10 and I applied for the White House Fellowship it's a non military program it is a great leadership public service program I threw you know that's a through my name and the hat it's quite an extensive application for us and ultimately was picked the their thousands of applicants the nation picks 14 to be White House Fellows every year and I got placed as the director for defense policy and strategy for Bush so literally report to the national security adviser who reports to the president like day seven I'm running my first meetings in the White House situation room it like the who is a lot of steep learning walking around pretending like you know how to you're wearing a washing in DC you know I'm like you know dumb team guy all of a sudden thrown in the policy world but you got speaking of getting this job in the selection process you got a cool thing in here that that talks about that a little bit going back to the book my interviewer sat me down and asked a bunch of questions a bunch of introductory questions then stared at me with intensity and said Mike what do you know about the start treaty I took a breath looked at him and said with dead pan seriousness I know how to spell it honestly I didn't know anything about our nation's nuclear treaties not a bit but what I did know and I told him this too was how to get the right people into a room and how to run the decision making process I knew how to figure out what motivated people how to get them to generate ideas how to cooperate and ultimately how to leave the room with the best possible outcome I wasn't afraid to admit that I didn't know a thing about nuclear policy and I think that's what got me the job being humble enough to admit that being humble enough to admit what you don't know but still confident enough to explain where you can add value is a balance that's often hard to strike but you need to recognize that it's a strength not a weakness to know what's beyond your knowledge or understanding at any point in time instead of pretending otherwise I walk into any room and always assume that people in it are smarter than I am faster than I am and more agile than I am that way I can never be wrong I never assume I have the idea I have an idea maybe it's the best one or maybe it's not but honestly it shouldn't even matter because our job in any room is to find the best answer for the problem we're working on no matter who's answer it is we have to listen to each other and really hear each other and the best way to do that is to walk into the room knowing there's no doubt that everyone in there has something useful to say so that's how you ended up with that job not by being this not by being the smartest guy about nuclear treaties but by saying hey look I don't know everything about that it was a legit they they legit three week one week of each other three phases of training and you know when you're going through it you're like how does this compare with the real thing it was after going through the real thing I look back and say we got a legit full treatment for each of the three weeks and I think nowadays they use that sort of it's called something else now I think it's called seal officer assessment and selection and it's it's something like mini buds but it's sort of the selection and how they're going to figure out who gets to go was it like that for for you guys I they definitely was we came out with like grades out of the 32 you know like not grades as an academic but like just an all around score of how you did and and you know I remember having a pretty high number and thought I think I'll be probably this will stand me pretty well if I applied to to circle back and go to buds and history has it I did and they took 16 guys out of ROTC my year 16 guys out of the academy so there are 32 officers taken into the program and as you know I don't know the number maybe 15 of those made it through ultimately or something like that there's only quid quitters and mini buds and it's a wake up called everybody to the recognition of what's going on out in that battlefield every single day which which you know you could hear it going on you could see it going on you could see vehicles you could see guys getting cows are backed out we were given blood whenever we could get blood like just that heavy reality of going to these scenarios um you guys you guys finish your work up you go on that that pre-depollement and now you got your platoon your your team over there your whole team never mind just the platoon now you got the whole team and it's not just your team that's you got SF guys you've got you've got an entire like force here it sounds like from the book you you had a little bit of a rough relationship with the conventional commander that was there initially with the one who was right next to me in Terran Coutt this guy just didn't want to get out and put his force at risk to go do great things and you know as well as I do you just you just don't respect people that don't want to do their job and like you know these days we think of a tech cooperation center you know we're talking plasma TV's in satellite links and internet you're talking you know like a star track look in scenario I shit you not we went on this mission and I fit this quote tactical operation center into one single rock sack I had like a sack for seventy seven hundred dollars something I had a bunch of maps I had some like I thought I was square away because I had you know like some overlays for the maps and then how much the world changed between that time and I were good friends former roommates but classmates 20 years earlier we had come up the ranks together before we each got married and started our families we shared a house in Virginia Beach for three years we were inseparable in those days we had bonded over our mutual frustration at the pull-up bar during buds training one Saturday morning after we both failed the day before to come him anywhere close to matching the 15 to 20 pull-ups our fellow trainees were able to do we decided to go find a pull-up bar to practice on far away from the buds compound we're no one would stumble upon us despite a full night's sleep we were still struggling as we fought as we each fought through our fourth pull-up I can still see his face and here the chuckle in his voice as he turned to me and said world's finest right here he was loyal genuine a man who could find humor in absolutely anything another time in training we were so cold on a boat ride back to the compound after an icy swim that we found ourselves fighting over where to place one rubber fin that was shielding very small parts of us from the 49 winds there we were two grown adults seal trainees fighting over a tiny rubber fin to help make us a tiny bit warmer and we and just a little drop less miserable we stopped for a moment and realized what we were fighting over and we both just broke out in hysterical laughter it seemed like we were always laughing back then when I was deployed he would check in on my family and when he was deployed I would check in on his I would say that I trusted him with my life except that it was so much more than that as seals we have no choice but to trust everyone on our team with our life every minute of every day on the battlefield but when you bond with someone it's not so much about trusting them with your life it's about wanting them to be there in the trenches with you feeling better because you know they're right alongside you he was so much more than a fellow seal he was a friend a teammate a brother a shiny example of the bravery a human being can exhibit you know you talk about the pressure and the pace and the battle rhythm or lack of rhythm and the lives it's stake and it's it's it's hard to describe what that feels like look I think one of the things that that young officers always wrestle with is how to walk the line between being a leader when a leader is needed to step forward but at the same time really have the humility that a lot of other people know a lot of things that you don't know and to me that's what makes the team special is is when you think about how you make decisions and who makes decisions we just grow up with that just built into who we are and and and and that's really uh you know the the the thing you test is when do I step forward and say all right guys shut up lock it on we're going this direction and when do you kind of step back like like like you you a spouse in a lot of your work is leading from the rear is but I did an incredible excel rocky Russell and who I would super supreme confidence in so I I'd go out on an operation and be with the the the Afghan commandos in a seal platoon for I don't know a day and a half two days at times and that's a that's a tough decision also because as soon as you swing and go on one operation with one unit dude you don't know what's happening with the other 24 so that takes an element of like confidence and trust but of course as you know it makes you a better leader because it helps you understand and maintain perspective and frankly just to share the same risk as the guys you know and and as of whatever I'm 51 now is a 41-ish year old seal team commander you know that deployment we got shot at and rocketed and the the I cut one of my guys legs off on that deployment and just wanted to have this. but you know hey as we got out of Afghanistan what went wrong the thing that went wrong was policy process broke down who are we bringing home we didn't have a question answer to that question and so that caused a lot of chaos and a little a lot of people rush to an airport hoping to get onto a flight you know so anyways that that's just one example of the how policy the the engine and the machine should work how many hours a day are you working in those long hours that was you know I'd get in it you know I always get my workout in the morning I honestly got there you know 737 eight clocks and like that and I forgot to mention the I know that the team thought incredibly highly of your and and Eshelon front's leadership and instruction and motivation and inspiration everything that you are that you espouse has made a huge positive impact on people and whenever that that finished up I think it was about a week ago or something like one of them was the most recent was about a week ago I got eat multiple emails saying hey this guy's awesome everything from like people who know that we know each other and others like hey you ever heard of this willing guy you know That's where all my like it was night after night of stopping bad think people from doing bad things to good people you know we were literally like vampire hours one cycle of darkness operations you know as soon as the the the sun goes down that think about you know you very your operation do you leave the FoB at 1030 pm or 1145 pm you know it's like and you go you know what we're just gonna stay out in the field like you told us you know well that that seems like the right call right now there's a little bit different here um going to the book to ensure civilian casualties where's limited is possible and that the innocent afghan civilians wouldn't turn against our forces the military set up a policy called boots on the ground battled damage assessment this meant that after every bomb we dropped we were we were required to physically go to the site to confirm that no civilians had been killed the theory a smart theory was that knowing we would have to acknowledge civilian casualties would make it less likely that there would be any civilian casualties a talented team of army green berets within my command had intelligence at one point that there were approximately 10 Taliban members gathered together at three in the morning in an area no civilian would ever go and certainly not at that time the team used surveillance techniques to view the site and we knew as a certainty that there were no civilians there they asked me for permission to drop a bomb from an unmanned aircraft and following the decision making process I'd put in place I granted it they went ahead and eight of the Taliban fighters were killed an army colonel from the commanding general staff in afghanistan called and asked my watch officer for our BDA report and my watch officer explained that we didn't have one that it was simply too much risk for not a good enough reason the road to the site was too dangerous to travel I mean of course you know I'd been exposed to everything already in my career but when you really feel that you feel that you are the owner of the risk of the whole team it's a different feeling there's a I used to think when I was second in charge of a seal team that it wouldn't really be that different to be overall in charge I couldn't have been more wrong so when I when a senior leadership team from from seal team to did our advanced reconnaissance if you will we came home on a meta-vac where I'll never forget there was a young man who was blown up in an IED who was really just being flown to Germany just so he could pass away in Germany next to his wife he was in a coma and I'll never forget like a you know six or eight hour flight just spending it next to this whole guy just my hand on him talking to him and just some army trooper who I don't even don't even know his name but like when you're really around that I got back to the states and I I already worked hard but it didn't work I realized I must have drifted much more than I expected I couldn't see back to the beach either for a few hours I was basically lost at sea worrying the other three more experience seals would think I was a total screw up I'd broken a fin strap and at one point I was startled okay scared when I was moved about 10 feet in the water bumped hard by a massive sea mammal I imagine that no one would ever find my body and everyone in the seals would think I must not a bit been a good swimmer despite entering buds training with one of the fastest swim times in the history the program and along with my swim buddy Chris Cassidy coming seconds away from the fastest ever two mile swim in buds finally the boat found me and picked me up and I was quickly exerated for being stupid enough to make the swim back out to sea my three teammates had ended up down the beach from where the current had taken me just a bit too far away from me to see them and they stayed on the beach until the boat came for them knowing conditions were too miserable to even attempt to head back I'd put myself at risk for a training exercise because I can fuse doing the hard thing with doing the right thing my decision was far too risky to make sense even as a confident and capable swimmer there's so many little lessons in that one right there that little story and by the way so your book is filled with a bunch of lessons and obviously I'm just reading excerpts from it and this chapter was choosing the hard path and doing the hard thing and of course everything's a dichotomy and you can do things where you go too hard but I can't even imagine you with your silver ranger which is for those of you that don't know it's a little compass that used to navigate on the land and you they you probably had it with you for like E&D or some whatever but you know growing up in the teams before 9-11 it was mission mission mission at all costs post 9-11 our community got much better at saying you know what there's new information let's incorporate new information what's going on let's think about risk is the risk worth the reward and constantly reassessing that risk you know it's it's uh it became okay to turn around on a mission in our raccara Afghanistan and say hey you know what the risk profile just change massively we'll come back another right for these this group of terrorists there's this risk is not worth assuming and let's not do the mission and and when I was growing up and when you were growing up we'd be excoriated for not doing the mission and we knew there were no civilians present and to ask anyone on my team to go down this isolated path in the middle of the night was an unnecessary risk to their lives and one it made no sense to take I got on the phone with the carnal and we went back and forth this is the policy but the policy in this case makes no sense to achieve an already known outcome I will not take unnecessary risk that my men will die there are consequences in the military for not following the orders of a superior truth is the lack of organizational flexibility is a huge problem for the military on the ground we were living a never agile enough kind of life but in terms of the larger hierarchy the structure had its weaknesses I could have been fired and sent home from the appointment as an in subordinate but in that moment I couldn't I couldn't just blindly follow the policy I had to act consistently with my values and make a judgment and subsequent decision that I was going to be able to live with if the worst happened the carnal said that since I wouldn't comply he was going to report my noncompliance to his boss the commanding general in Afghanistan and that he would ask his peer in charge of our Afghan partner force to order his men to unilaterally inspect the site instead I urged him not to do that but that decision was out of my hands 12 Afghan soldiers drove down that isolated road in three vehicles to make their assessment of the bomb site the first two trucks hit an IED and three V8 people in those two vehicles were killed with others seriously wounded soon after I flew by helicopter to the outstation where the green beret turned team was stationed sat with them and told them how incredibly proud I was of their amazing bravery their remarkable work they did night after danger snite it was one of the more emotional moments in my life as we started our meeting silence fell over the room and one of the guys on the team opened by looking me square in the eyes and quietly but resolutely thanking me he knew that the easier decision would have been caving to the pressure from above and deviating from my beliefs and we all knew that would have meant some of the men in this room would have died the green beret had no idea that his words made my throat almost closed as I choked up and how hard I had to fight off tears I was simply overwhelmed by the real life impact by the reality of the situation the overwhelming magnitude of these kind of decisions made under the pressure of intense nightly combat take a toll on people that's difficult to understand for those who haven't experienced it now with the benefit of several years of hindsight and the time to fully reflect on those past events I haven't even even greater belief in the importance of process your own process and a values based decision making process can no exaggeration save people's lives oh he's gonna order someone else to address those I already knew the outcome because I know you're not pushing back for no reason you're pushing back for good reason it might be hard for people to understand that kind of pressure that you're under to kind of concede and just go with what you're being told to do there's times in life you gotta just put it on the table and say be ready for the outcome be ready to be fired you always hear pick your battles this was unquestionably one of them and this is why you are in command and this is why that's is everything that you've trained to do at that point in life is for that it's for a moment like that it's to have confidence in yourself that you're that you're right and to not take that unnecessary risk I still get you know emotional as you were reading it I haven't you know and you've got the sec death the sec state all of the the number ones of all the departments and agencies around the table again binary outcome agree or not if agree great policy made if not that's going to the president and so by definition you've created a system where you get volume and flow but only but only the hardest things are making it to the top sometimes that runs well sometimes that doesn't run well and so as I sit back you know I think about you know how are things working are they working like they can or should as soon as decisions get made outside of that process you you you you actually diminish the probability of the best possible decision getting made because you know as well as I do if not everybody's at the table like I was a total nerd I would sharpen my knife and polish my boots like all weekend long and I didn't even think about the recovery aspect I think that's a new thing like the idea of recovery I don't know I didn't really have that I didn't really think of that you didn't have guys walking around with those big jug the gallon jugs of water like that that that was the thing in our our time just pump the fluids after the after the day and for the weekend but the incoming team was also there and my friend you know pulled me aside afterwards and said hey that was you know really rough for us to set the bar to expect that we're not gonna lose anybody and and it turns out that that the leader from the East Coast seal teams had also pulled my friend aside and said hey listen just do the same thing Mike did just bring everybody home and and he had lost four guys in his first month and so I think that pressure of losing people and you know it's it's it just it didn't it didn't add up so I mean I don't say that's the cause but it's certainly unquestionably a contributor. and so you don't like know the perspective of not being in the platoon and not understanding what that looks like from the outside and not understanding what it looks like when there's some kind of an incident and how much that disrupts everyone and how much it hurts our reputation as seals you know that's something you know when you're in a siope to and someone gets in trouble you're and so you know right away we're exposed to you know real situations and so lots of like like you know a lot of the the biggest learning comes from the hardest situations what uh what schools did you go to as a new guy officer Notre Dame I've been there a few times and it you know like the females aren't allowed in the male dorms and you have for the if they are they got to be out of there by 10 o'clock at night like it's pretty strict from a college aged person perspective it's holy cross like that as well it's not as strict the there were you know at this point maybe I'm gonna guess roughly 10 or 15 Jesuit priests on as as professors when I was in college it's less now and then maybe you know the next time you said you know you say you're debrief from hey listen man when you start yelling and screaming on the radio no one's listening to you anymore it's not getting through anybody they can't make sense of what you're saying you need to calm down you need to think about what you're gonna say simple clearing exercise language so you breathe from on that and then the next time maybe they start getting excited you go hey man hey Fred come here take a wrap off think about what you're gonna say what are you gonna tell your pertune to do and what I what I love about this is this is so true the main thing you're worried about you're lost at sea for hours you're getting pushed around by sea animals the main thing you're worried about is looking like a loser for you to keep it if you bad team guy that's exactly right you know I still vividly remember being you know pushed this you know eight or ten feet or so in the water and just thinking and then we'd have three or four days off so we were actually in quite a regular predictable cycle while we were overseas you talk a little bit about one of these operations here in the book here we go I was in co-savo in 1999 in the middle of winter leading a small surveillance team in the mountains just a few hundred meters from the Serbian border freezing cold temperatures the darkness of night howling winds and both co-savar Serbian and Albanian armies somewhere in that same snowy terrain weapons ready looking for an enemy to fight as we suffered through the elements the sun soon to rise we knew we needed to find a place to rest and hide for the daylight hours from our vantage point halfway up the side of a mountain struggling to maintain our balance on the steeply sloping ground we could see a natural line of drift below railroad tracks a 10 foot wide patch of flat ground a path that could that would have called out to anyone as the comfortable place we should naturally set up camp of course we wanted to move down there I remember a young guy and our team in credulous that we could even be out in this kind of weather humans can't survive in this he said it's miserable the temptation to head down toward the easier path and the more comfortable sight was real but if it was calling out to us we knew it would be calling out to anyone who happened to be coming that way going down there would make us more visible more vulnerable and more likely to run into trouble so we set up camp a couple hundred year meters up the steeply angled slope and sure enough within an hour and just a short time before sunrise what looked like the entire Albanian army marched straight down that natural line of drift had we been camped there they would have found us for sure doing the uncomfortable exhausting thing the hard thing saved us that day so those are the type of operations you were doing so when it came time to put out word you know like to tell everyone what was going on he just didn't have the couldn't project his voice at all and so I'm talking to him like hey man listen you gotta start you gotta start putting the word out and in my mind I'm thinking you know maybe this is just I I mean friends that did you know showed up and did 50 pull ups and I you know struggle with my you know eight and a quarter you know it was like that and then you come over to Germany this is where I meet you 97 98 98 because I went I basically got done with OCS I showed up at Sealtime 2 and immediately went over there and it was the Master Chief there who was one of my platoon chiefs and apparently the conversation went the the commander over there or or an ops officer said hey we need like a we need someone to come and help out with with ops and they were sending their sending this ensin and they're saying who the the cus are sending us team 2 sent us a damn ensin like what good is this guy going to do and then then the Master Chief sees my name and goes away to second I know this guy yes you can so the process is work out eat good take relevant supplements and I do see a relevant because that's that's something it's not nothing some people take your relevant supplements in my opinion so take relevant supplements you stick to that process now you're on the right track there you go jockel field dot com get yourself some of those relevant supplements true not what you call the other stuff irrelevant not irrelevant supplements you did very too much on your vocab there you went relevant irrelevant which is fine you know we talk about effective ineffective you're doing the same thing it's cool authorized you're staying with the process jockel fuel dot com you can check it out at wall while you can get the drinks by the way this is probably worth saying right now we got all new flavors coming out not only new flavors but the old flavors which let's face it some people didn't like that much we'd read it a while and I'll tell you what they're all amazing now and I think the you I know you live this way also the faster you learn that an integrated team is what it needs what it takes to be successful the faster your trajectories to success these are things that weren't learned quite as quickly in the early days but in that deployment all of the younger guys that that were able to hand off you know the Iraqis the the the the insurgents that they took off a target and hand them to somebody else to interrogate them and you know there's a lot of people that can ask questions in interrogate you don't have to be a seal to have that skill or intelligence analyst or whatever the case may be It is and you know it's handling Afghanistan policy as well and Scott Moore was the detailer the Scott that you just referred to in the in the previous passage and he said hey Mike you're gonna you're gonna take over sealed team too can you get yourself out of the White House like we can't pull you out like you're the only one who's gonna have to you know seal astronaut and now CEO of this museum and what we're really doing with this is we're on a mission to inspire America we will we will take the lessons that the metal of honor recipients have that that they espouse the character the values etc and and talk about that to make the nation greater and and the vision is for you know some young kid to see the brits LeBinsky and what he did and learn about his character values or you know strike brits name and replace it with any recipient and say how do I you know I'm seeing this little third third grade situation develop a I see a girl being bullied on the school yard how do I step in and go make this situation right that is what we we want to stop that or school shootings or or having the bravery the courage to step in during a school shooting and and stop the shooting from happening or just to make the make our nation stronger and better and the the premise is really to inspire America we will open in about a year and a half what we haven't to completely determine our opening date but this will be one of the nations if not them we're planning life and this is an element of time when you're like it takes patience to for the plan to come together it's not like you can plan harder and create things to happen in 12 hours and and man I'm bad at a lot of things but patience is definitely one of my weeks weeks spots you have this this section which I think kind of wraps up some of your transition here you say this I hear the question all the time how did you manage to move from the military to the government to the private sector when those arenas are so different from each other my answer is to premise the challenge or challenge the premise of this question of course there are different different details different specifics but the truth is in my experience all high stakes organizations and all high stakes decisions are pretty much the same the concrete knowledge you need is the easy part anyone can learn that but the details don't matter if you don't have the right process and if you do have the right process you can go anywhere it's why strong leaders are able to jump from one industry to another one organization to another
