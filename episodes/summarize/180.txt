she's like, yeah, because like when you get used to guys and meanwhile, there's like two guys scrolling like hard though. But I saw her wheels turning when she was like, like, yeah, you know, like, I will all see the results, you know. It's kind of like kind of like, you know, when you have a dog and you got to feed them the heartworm pills. You know, we were in when I was in Ramadi, you know, you see like picture of seals with like beards and all that I was rolling with a guy literally, like he's like trying to release my grip from his wrist or whatever, and like he's visibly angry, because he couldn't. So during one of the classes, they would have, you know, like, in my case, it was a rainy day where in the gym, there's like 607 of people sitting on the floor. When I got, when we got back that night, it wasn't just me that felt like that because that night, all my guys, they went in every humv every input belt fed machine guns, we mounted and we staged them. But a bit bomb like a 2000 pound bomb in order in areas that were so packed with vegetation that you couldn't get in helicopter and they're like, oh, we got a night. And the last thing I want to read from the book is just this section right here, the dedication, it says this book is dedicated to all sog reconnaissance team members, both US special forces and indigenous troops, as well as to every man in every air support unit, especially the King B pilots of the 219th South Vietnamese Air Forces special operation squadron who worked daily with sog teams on the ground across the fence in America's secret war. You need to come up with something where we have better backup, especially when the situation is because you guys can get air support and you guys used it heavily, but as soon as the weather rolled in, it was like, you guys are out there on your own. Where you uh, the other interesting thing that you talk about in the book, uh, I don't think it was one of yours, but even when you guys would do training missions over there, that was like a potential for enemy contact on your training missions. It still, it like it puts you in this mindset of like, you know, working and re-pain results of work. I thought we have, you know, like, you like we've seen in the movie with John. It's not like an accountant is like some, you know, scraping by sort of gay. And she said basically the stuff we were saying, where she was like, I was like, but I only see her sort of in the men's class. And the reason we called the company actually on front is because we wanted people know that we were the guys that were like in the front, not the REMS. You guys didn't have an A-Dob like a like a belt fed machine gun. Well, like I said or like you said, But you know, eventually we went out, learned about weapons a little bit along the way, and then of course when this came along, do we got to real deal? One time I was doing, you know, you got to have introduced you have risk control, you know, and varying levels of risk control depending on the position. If you're honest with you, I came back in, by the time I landed in the States, like May 1, May 2, 1969, the anti war movement was going on strong. Yeah, they're a piss because when King went down to the first chopper, nobody else followed and I said, you make sure you tell them, then you give me the green light, then we'll send some people, and then Bubba and I got on the second next track. So your kids instead of turning out to be like an obese, out-of-shape kid that you were like trying to, no, don't even put them on that path. So that was a slot so sometimes the guys would be wounded they couldn't go to the field but they could fly cubby got it so that when we're on the ground we have a situation that we're dealing with then he's able to understand as opposed to talking to an air force pilot right who's just used to getting a bomb and drop it somewhere and talk about a contingent liability that's been off of a firefight One of the guys at Rambeacon says, remember those pictures you got on the your second book on the ground there I said, yeah, No, no, no, no, it's like that's a, and there's a few people like that. But it was taking those couple steps, jumping in and going like, WTF2, what's going on here now? So I read the book and I said, you know what, if I'm going to go, if I can get in with these guys, that'd be a great challenge. yeah, that's amazing that you guys, and also you had the you had the cognizance to say, hey, wait a second, we've never worked with these helicopters before get out there and tell them we got some Vietnamese folks coming their way with AK 47s. You think he decided like this guy's probably got the drop on me and I want to live. She's like, when you get with it, and we kind of laugh because we she like motions to them. No, you got we got the whole wheat sandwich with like turkey from a real turkey with sprouted grains. So well it seems like like now it is night is no factor for America. Because I mean, I got just, I mean, this these books are, there's awesome the detail that you go on to and just the experiences you've had, which are just it's a miracle that you're sitting here, talking and able to tell us what you went through when, as far as I can tell, there's no way in hell you should be sitting here right now. Was this just like completely like he's you could barely even could you see his face at all? You know, I'm just going to, I'm just going to, for the record, if I go one insertion and I get shot off, I'm coming home. The weird thing is I guess and having worked in the jungle a little bit, you know, I spent some time in the jungle in South America in the Southeast Asia. Like it's not, I'm not saying it's like, or it's so serious. But just the weight, the rounds and everything else, you know, like a my case, I carried the radio, always carried the radio. That was just like, what do you like to eat? Like like, he spoke four languages, he had been educated in France and he cracked up my English.
