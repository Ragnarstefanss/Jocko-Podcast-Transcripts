00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
This is Jockel Podcast number 49 with echo Charles and me, Jockel Willick.

2
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
It starts off quietly.

3
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:27.000
When you're young, you don't quite know where it comes from and at first you don't even know what it is.

4
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
But you know it's something.

5
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
You feel it, you feel it growing.

6
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
You're just a child, but you feel it.

7
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Something, something inside of you.

8
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.000
And at some point that thing, it crosses over.

9
00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:02.000
It goes from being something that you don't fully recognize something that you don't completely understand.

10
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.000
It goes from that to being you.

11
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Those things become you.

12
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
It is you. It is your emotions.

13
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:30.000
It is sadness and happiness and passion and anger and joy and it is rage.

14
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.000
And those things, those emotions, they burn.

15
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
And they burn hot.

16
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
They're a fire that grows out of control.

17
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
They fuel your mind and your body and your soul.

18
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
And that marks the change.

19
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Becoming a person.

20
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Becoming an individual instead of a child.

21
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
You release the inferno.

22
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:15.000
And burn what you touch and unite those near you.

23
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
And in that fire, you burn.

24
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000
You burn out of control and people around you.

25
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000
The people, the other humans, the normal humans.

26
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.000
They do their best to extinguish that fire.

27
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
They tell you to relax.

28
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.000
They tell you to calm down.

29
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000
They tell you to get a grip.

30
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
They tell you it isn't healthy.

31
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
And that's because they are scared.

32
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
They're scared of that fire in your soul.

33
00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
And so they tell you that you are crazy.

34
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:13.000
And because the anger and the rage and the sadness are so brutal and so hard to suffer through,

35
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000
you begin to listen to those people,

36
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
to those normal humans.

37
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000
And so you begin to subdue the fire.

38
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
You start to get those emotions under control.

39
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000
And at some point you realize this is better.

40
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
Better to control those emotions.

41
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
Better to starve those passions.

42
00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
You begin to shut them down.

43
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
You are a child.

44
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
No more.

45
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
No more.

46
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
Angry youth.

47
00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000
No. Now you are an adult.

48
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
A responsible adult.

49
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
You control your emotions.

50
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
You don't let them control you.

51
00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
And the anger and the rage and the sadness.

52
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
They begin to wither up.

53
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.000
They become listless.

54
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
Just memories.

55
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.000
But when the anger and the rage and the sadness fade,

56
00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.000
so does the passion and the happiness and the joy.

57
00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
And of course, because it happens slowly,

58
00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
you are not going to be the eye-to-be.

59
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.000
You don't notice it.

60
00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
It is not the MONTH OF LIGHTNING or a violent explosion

61
00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
that kills them but a slow, slithering death.

62
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000
Then, one day you wake up,

63
00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
and you catch your glimpse of yourself in the mirror.

64
00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:23.60
And as you look into your own faded lifeless eyes, you see something.

65
00:05:23.60 --> 00:05:31.40
Something you recognize, something subtle and worn, but something still filled with a

66
00:05:31.40 --> 00:05:37.28
subdued power.

67
00:05:37.28 --> 00:05:51.38
And you remember what that felt like, what anger, enjoy and horror and happiness felt

68
00:05:51.38 --> 00:05:57.96
like, and you wonder what happened to them.

69
00:05:57.96 --> 00:06:08.16
And you realize that in order to control your passions, you destroyed them.

70
00:06:08.16 --> 00:06:13.72
All of them.

71
00:06:13.72 --> 00:06:17.88
But let me tell you, they are dead.

72
00:06:17.88 --> 00:06:27.92
They cannot so easily be killed, they are there, and they are waiting to be released again.

73
00:06:27.92 --> 00:06:33.30
And no, you don't have to let them get out of control, but you can certainly let them

74
00:06:33.30 --> 00:06:35.80
out into the wild.

75
00:06:35.80 --> 00:06:40.88
You can dance with them.

76
00:06:40.88 --> 00:06:48.44
And of course, while you need to balance them and maintain the upper hand over your emotions,

77
00:06:48.44 --> 00:06:55.04
you can still relish in their glory.

78
00:06:55.04 --> 00:06:58.000
You have to let them out.

79
00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:05.40
You have to expose the nerves, feel the pain, feel the frustration, the sadness, the shock,

80
00:07:05.40 --> 00:07:17.92
the anger, and in those adverse moments, then you also get to feel the laughter.

81
00:07:17.92 --> 00:07:34.04
The joy, the gratitude, the passion, because it is the passion, not in difference that

82
00:07:34.04 --> 00:07:36.64
fuels greatness.

83
00:07:36.64 --> 00:07:47.84
And it is conviction, not tranquility that drives execution.

84
00:07:47.84 --> 00:07:58.64
And while we must not ever let our emotions dictate our decisions, we are not here to eradicate

85
00:07:58.64 --> 00:08:01.76
our emotions.

86
00:08:01.76 --> 00:08:03.76
Control them?

87
00:08:03.76 --> 00:08:08.40
Yes, of course, you must maintain control of your emotions.

88
00:08:08.40 --> 00:08:10.28
Keep them in check?

89
00:08:10.28 --> 00:08:20.56
Yes, by all means, emotional restraint is a necessity, but destroy them?

90
00:08:20.56 --> 00:08:24.000
No.

91
00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:30.32
That is not what we do.

92
00:08:30.32 --> 00:08:42.92
So let your guard down, expose your weaknesses, take some risks, open up your fragile

93
00:08:42.92 --> 00:08:59.12
soul and those embers, those small-dering embers that you have tried to smother.

94
00:08:59.12 --> 00:09:06.66
But that are ready to ignite again and become an inferno of energy and of power, feed those

95
00:09:06.66 --> 00:09:11.28
embers.

96
00:09:11.28 --> 00:09:21.16
Light that fire again, soak it with air and fuel and more fire.

97
00:09:21.16 --> 00:09:31.000
And let it burn.

98
00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.20
Good evening, echo.

99
00:09:32.20 --> 00:09:35.48
Good evening.

100
00:09:35.48 --> 00:09:45.80
There was just some thoughts I had as I was thinking about one of those dichotters in life.

101
00:09:45.80 --> 00:09:52.92
And obviously I talk a lot about maintaining control of your emotions, but we can go too

102
00:09:52.92 --> 00:09:56.04
far with that idea.

103
00:09:56.04 --> 00:10:04.12
And I wanted to remind myself that if we take that I do too far, we're actually going to

104
00:10:04.12 --> 00:10:16.60
re-gress backwards in a negative way.

105
00:10:16.60 --> 00:10:23.64
Which brings us to straight-up Q&A today.

106
00:10:23.64 --> 00:10:27.24
Questions from the interwebs?

107
00:10:27.24 --> 00:10:28.24
Yeah.

108
00:10:28.24 --> 00:10:29.24
Bring it.

109
00:10:29.24 --> 00:10:32.44
Oh, you got some comment?

110
00:10:32.44 --> 00:10:37.44
Just wait a minute asking me.

111
00:10:37.44 --> 00:10:39.44
Twitter, right?

112
00:10:39.44 --> 00:10:43.04
Or Twitter's really solid.

113
00:10:43.04 --> 00:10:46.04
Facebook is also good.

114
00:10:46.04 --> 00:10:48.04
Instagram don't.

115
00:10:48.04 --> 00:10:49.04
Don't.

116
00:10:49.04 --> 00:10:51.48
I'm on Instagram.

117
00:10:51.48 --> 00:10:54.84
But it's harder for me to compile those questions when people hit me with those.

118
00:10:54.84 --> 00:10:56.08
They don't stand out as much.

119
00:10:56.08 --> 00:11:01.36
They're in a caption of a picture 27 comments down and it's just, yeah, not.

120
00:11:01.36 --> 00:11:02.36
Not the best way.

121
00:11:02.36 --> 00:11:03.36
Not the best way.

122
00:11:03.36 --> 00:11:04.36
Yeah.

123
00:11:04.36 --> 00:11:05.36
Facebook Twitter.

124
00:11:05.36 --> 00:11:11.36
Everyone's in all the people who will submit them through the store.

125
00:11:11.36 --> 00:11:14.36
And possible way.

126
00:11:14.36 --> 00:11:22.84
Yeah, it's good, but you kind of do bring the risk of there being store issues that are

127
00:11:22.84 --> 00:11:23.84
pressing.

128
00:11:23.84 --> 00:11:31.12
And then I'm like, okay, let me get back to this question whether be to forward it or whatever.

129
00:11:31.12 --> 00:11:32.12
I say you run the risk of it.

130
00:11:32.12 --> 00:11:35.12
Maybe getting shuffled to the bottom or something.

131
00:11:35.12 --> 00:11:37.64
Yeah, I'm trying to think there might be a more efficient way to do it.

132
00:11:37.64 --> 00:11:38.64
Yeah.

133
00:11:38.64 --> 00:11:40.68
Maybe I should just be doing a one.

134
00:11:40.68 --> 00:11:44.16
Maybe I should do for each podcast on Facebook.

135
00:11:44.16 --> 00:11:47.64
Say, hey, if you have questions for the next podcast, ask them on this thread right

136
00:11:47.64 --> 00:11:48.64
here.

137
00:11:48.64 --> 00:11:50.64
That might be a way to do it.

138
00:11:50.64 --> 00:11:53.28
What about an email questions?

139
00:11:53.28 --> 00:11:56.64
That, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that

140
00:11:56.64 --> 00:11:57.64
that might be a good idea.

141
00:11:57.64 --> 00:11:58.64
Interesting.

142
00:11:58.64 --> 00:11:59.64
All right.

143
00:11:59.64 --> 00:12:01.64
If only I knew someone that knew how to set that up.

144
00:12:01.64 --> 00:12:02.64
Yeah.

145
00:12:02.64 --> 00:12:03.64
All right.

146
00:12:03.64 --> 00:12:07.92
Speaking of questions from me in a web, what do you got?

147
00:12:07.92 --> 00:12:08.92
First question.

148
00:12:08.92 --> 00:12:09.92
Juckle.

149
00:12:09.92 --> 00:12:15.80
What is the biggest turnaround on stance slash opinion you've ever made?

150
00:12:15.80 --> 00:12:21.80
Now, this is, this is one of those questions that I sat there and thought about it for

151
00:12:21.80 --> 00:12:22.80
while.

152
00:12:22.80 --> 00:12:29.60
And then I realized that the answer was sitting right in front of my face literally.

153
00:12:29.60 --> 00:12:31.60
Sitting right in front of my face.

154
00:12:31.60 --> 00:12:33.60
And that is this.

155
00:12:33.60 --> 00:12:34.60
Mm-hmm.

156
00:12:34.60 --> 00:12:41.04
It's the podcast, the book, the social media, all of it.

157
00:12:41.04 --> 00:12:43.24
Because I've talked about this before.

158
00:12:43.24 --> 00:12:49.84
I was raised in this hill team to be the quiet professional.

159
00:12:49.84 --> 00:12:54.52
And as a matter of fact, one of my, one of my favorite seals when I was a young guy at

160
00:12:54.52 --> 00:12:59.56
team one, this guy was just a, just a total badass for all.

161
00:12:59.56 --> 00:13:03.000
And learned, learned, I learned a ton from him.

162
00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.56
And he was actually, you know, some people say, oh, that guy's good at everything.

163
00:13:07.56 --> 00:13:11.04
This guy was actually awesome at everything, like everything that there was to do.

164
00:13:11.04 --> 00:13:13.88
A shooting, a flighting, a climbing, a tactics.

165
00:13:13.88 --> 00:13:15.96
Everything that he did, he was awesome at.

166
00:13:15.96 --> 00:13:21.40
And he was super, super hardcore, just tough.

167
00:13:21.40 --> 00:13:27.24
And in fact, one of the stories about him is that when he joined the Navy and he had to come

168
00:13:27.24 --> 00:13:33.64
to boot camp, I guess in San Diego, he paddled a kayak from where he lived to get in

169
00:13:33.64 --> 00:13:34.64
San Diego.

170
00:13:34.64 --> 00:13:36.28
And he was 17 years old, by the way.

171
00:13:36.28 --> 00:13:39.72
He was just a 17 year old kid joined the Navy when he was 17.

172
00:13:39.72 --> 00:13:41.16
And then had no way of getting here.

173
00:13:41.16 --> 00:13:45.32
So, co take a kayak, put it in the water, and paddle the San Diego on the road.

174
00:13:45.32 --> 00:13:49.24
That seems to be the smart way to do things.

175
00:13:49.24 --> 00:13:53.20
And so back in the day, he had a hat.

176
00:13:53.20 --> 00:13:54.20
And he had this hat.

177
00:13:54.20 --> 00:13:57.44
This before you'd see seal, memorabilia everywhere.

178
00:13:57.44 --> 00:14:00.12
You just see it all over the place.

179
00:14:00.12 --> 00:14:03.60
He had this hat with just a tried-in on it.

180
00:14:03.60 --> 00:14:05.68
Nothing else, just a tried-in.

181
00:14:05.68 --> 00:14:14.000
And then under the tried-in, it just said the words, the silent option.

182
00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.64
And I always thought to myself, yes, that is it right there.

183
00:14:17.64 --> 00:14:19.24
That's us, right?

184
00:14:19.24 --> 00:14:20.84
The silent option.

185
00:14:20.84 --> 00:14:26.44
So fanfare, no news, no parade, no fame, or fortune, or glory of any kind.

186
00:14:26.44 --> 00:14:27.44
No, none of that.

187
00:14:27.44 --> 00:14:28.44
The silent option.

188
00:14:28.44 --> 00:14:31.44
That's it.

189
00:14:31.44 --> 00:14:38.76
And pretty much everybody that I looked up to in the seal teams had that kind of attitude.

190
00:14:38.76 --> 00:14:43.56
And there's something that is obviously so pure about that attitude.

191
00:14:43.56 --> 00:14:47.08
So, selfless.

192
00:14:47.08 --> 00:14:54.68
But none of what you did as a seal was ever for any kind of recognition, ever.

193
00:14:54.68 --> 00:14:58.28
And that to me was sort of the code.

194
00:14:58.28 --> 00:15:02.76
Now there were people that stepped out from that code.

195
00:15:02.76 --> 00:15:07.32
And while it certainly wasn't encouraged, it wasn't really ridiculed either.

196
00:15:07.32 --> 00:15:10.60
I mean, people did it.

197
00:15:10.60 --> 00:15:12.20
People wrote books.

198
00:15:12.20 --> 00:15:16.84
And it wasn't looked that down upon.

199
00:15:16.84 --> 00:15:19.96
At the time, unless you were a bad team guy.

200
00:15:19.96 --> 00:15:24.88
If you were a bad seal, or if you were a guy that had a bad reputation, you would be crushed

201
00:15:24.88 --> 00:15:25.88
in the seal teams.

202
00:15:25.88 --> 00:15:27.96
It amongst the team guys in the community.

203
00:15:27.96 --> 00:15:30.56
Now civilians, they don't know the difference, right?

204
00:15:30.56 --> 00:15:33.60
I mean, to civilians, how can they tell?

205
00:15:33.60 --> 00:15:35.68
They just a seal is a seal as a seal.

206
00:15:35.68 --> 00:15:37.04
So they're good with it.

207
00:15:37.04 --> 00:15:43.80
But in the teams, if you had a bad reputation, your reputation would get even worse

208
00:15:43.80 --> 00:15:45.68
if you broke the code.

209
00:15:45.68 --> 00:15:53.84
So when I retired, I had zero intention of going public, right?

210
00:15:53.84 --> 00:15:55.76
Of becommonism.

211
00:15:55.76 --> 00:16:01.28
And then when I started working with civilian companies and late for them to come

212
00:16:01.28 --> 00:16:05.72
to the national on front, and we realized pretty quickly that there was a big need for

213
00:16:05.72 --> 00:16:10.68
people to learn what we had to teach.

214
00:16:10.68 --> 00:16:16.44
And really quickly, the demand for us to write this down and be able to give it to people

215
00:16:16.44 --> 00:16:18.68
grew and it was really obvious to us.

216
00:16:18.68 --> 00:16:24.68
So when that started, when we started, when that started, we started wrote it down, and

217
00:16:24.68 --> 00:16:30.56
then that started to transform this idea of what we had written down, started transforming

218
00:16:30.56 --> 00:16:35.12
and to becoming a book, like a legitimate book.

219
00:16:35.12 --> 00:16:41.52
I got really nervous and scared and kind of almost sick.

220
00:16:41.52 --> 00:16:46.56
I was definitely very weary about it.

221
00:16:46.56 --> 00:16:50.12
And I think I did some little self-sabotage along the way just a little bit here.

222
00:16:50.12 --> 00:16:51.76
You know, I just, well, I don't know.

223
00:16:51.76 --> 00:16:54.76
You know, it's probably not going to be, you know, I think I did some of that stuff.

224
00:16:54.76 --> 00:16:55.76
I'd have to think about it.

225
00:16:55.76 --> 00:17:02.64
In fact, I know I did some of it, because it's kind of an all or nothing proposition.

226
00:17:02.64 --> 00:17:08.08
You're either do it or you don't do it, and I guess you could try and use like a pseudonym,

227
00:17:08.08 --> 00:17:10.68
but then that doesn't really, that's not me.

228
00:17:10.68 --> 00:17:17.16
I'm not going to even, I'm not going to make up a personality, and not be me, right?

229
00:17:17.16 --> 00:17:19.64
So that wasn't really an option.

230
00:17:19.64 --> 00:17:21.80
And furthermore, I knew that that doesn't really last either.

231
00:17:21.80 --> 00:17:25.04
I mean, the pseudonyms eventually, people figure out who they are and so that's the way it

232
00:17:25.04 --> 00:17:28.80
works.

233
00:17:28.80 --> 00:17:38.64
And I think the thing that finally made me say, okay, I'm going to do this is that,

234
00:17:38.64 --> 00:17:40.84
as I decided, like, okay, I'm going to do this.

235
00:17:40.84 --> 00:17:46.08
I just kind of knew I wasn't going to be anything else other than what I was, right?

236
00:17:46.08 --> 00:17:51.12
I'm not going to try and put on some persona or be something that I'm not.

237
00:17:51.12 --> 00:17:53.28
I'm just going to be me.

238
00:17:53.28 --> 00:17:57.24
And I've got, you know, that's what I'm going to do.

239
00:17:57.24 --> 00:18:00.12
And so that's what I did.

240
00:18:00.12 --> 00:18:03.52
You know, the me that is here is just me.

241
00:18:03.52 --> 00:18:07.72
There's nothing special that's just who I am.

242
00:18:07.72 --> 00:18:15.000
And that's all I did was basically expose what I am to, you know, people in the public.

243
00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:25.20
Now, the thing is, now that I actually am out there a little bit, and people can kind of

244
00:18:25.20 --> 00:18:28.16
see me in the world, right?

245
00:18:28.16 --> 00:18:33.24
There's definitely some things that I don't like about it.

246
00:18:33.24 --> 00:18:35.56
Or I should say, I don't like, there's some challenges, right?

247
00:18:35.56 --> 00:18:37.24
There's some challenges there.

248
00:18:37.24 --> 00:18:39.28
For instance, you're being watched all the time.

249
00:18:39.28 --> 00:18:45.64
You're being followed and being, you're being judged.

250
00:18:45.64 --> 00:18:51.04
And those things right there are coincidentally the exact same kind of challenges you

251
00:18:51.04 --> 00:18:52.44
face when you're in a leadership position.

252
00:18:52.44 --> 00:18:55.48
But I face when I was leadership position, oh, people are watching me.

253
00:18:55.48 --> 00:18:56.88
Oh, people are judging me.

254
00:18:56.88 --> 00:19:00.000
I'm used to that.

255
00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:05.52
That's what it was like when I was in the sealed teams.

256
00:19:05.52 --> 00:19:15.12
And just like when I was in the sealed teams, I always tried to stay true to what I believed

257
00:19:15.12 --> 00:19:17.000
in and what I believed was right.

258
00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:18.44
And not to say I never made mistakes.

259
00:19:18.44 --> 00:19:30.40
I obviously did, but I always gave it my all to do the best job I could do and to take

260
00:19:30.40 --> 00:19:33.24
care of my guys, my brothers and my friends.

261
00:19:33.24 --> 00:19:36.44
That's what I always tried to do.

262
00:19:36.44 --> 00:19:41.64
And really that's all I'm still trying to do.

263
00:19:41.64 --> 00:19:48.40
Is just to give something back to pass on some of the things, some of the little things

264
00:19:48.40 --> 00:19:50.88
that I've ordered along the way.

265
00:19:50.88 --> 00:19:58.68
And really when I get the feedback from my sealed teammates from guys that are still active

266
00:19:58.68 --> 00:20:03.88
duty and the sealed teams, from soldiers and Marines that are retired or guys that are still

267
00:20:03.88 --> 00:20:08.40
on active duty or guys that transition to the civilian world, all those guys, guys from

268
00:20:08.40 --> 00:20:09.40
the front lines.

269
00:20:09.40 --> 00:20:13.08
That are all the front lines right now.

270
00:20:13.08 --> 00:20:18.36
And then guys that are law enforcement and firefighters.

271
00:20:18.36 --> 00:20:26.000
When all those bad whole crew, that whole group of people send me some kind of thanks,

272
00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:27.52
it's awesome.

273
00:20:27.52 --> 00:20:32.96
And in addition to them, I don't know if this is surprising or not, but I hear from

274
00:20:32.96 --> 00:20:42.16
just every day normal people to civilians, right, businessmen, laborers, entrepreneurs,

275
00:20:42.16 --> 00:20:49.48
builders, mechanics, plumbers, electricians, software engineers, doctors, men and women, girls

276
00:20:49.48 --> 00:20:57.60
and boys, young and all, just every imaginable size, shape, color of person from every

277
00:20:57.60 --> 00:21:04.20
walk of life.

278
00:21:04.20 --> 00:21:05.64
And I hear from them.

279
00:21:05.64 --> 00:21:12.20
And when I hear from them, and I see that they're getting something out of this, that makes

280
00:21:12.20 --> 00:21:18.000
those little challenges of judgment and scrutiny.

281
00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:24.88
It makes all those worthwhile to me.

282
00:21:24.88 --> 00:21:37.32
Because once again, I feel like I'm part of something that's bigger than me, bigger than

283
00:21:37.32 --> 00:21:46.72
myself, something more powerful than I could ever be by myself, something stronger than

284
00:21:46.72 --> 00:21:49.60
I could ever be alone.

285
00:21:49.60 --> 00:22:02.28
And for me to be doing what I can do to help that and to have that, to have trying to help

286
00:22:02.28 --> 00:22:09.68
be both the task and the reward.

287
00:22:09.68 --> 00:22:14.64
It's a reward to help people.

288
00:22:14.64 --> 00:22:19.92
That to me has made it worthwhile.

289
00:22:19.92 --> 00:22:21.92
Yeah, I could see that.

290
00:22:21.92 --> 00:22:29.04
Will give the silent professional the quiet professional and the silent option.

291
00:22:29.04 --> 00:22:34.04
Two different variations on the same theme.

292
00:22:34.04 --> 00:22:35.92
Is that?

293
00:22:35.92 --> 00:22:42.04
Because if that wasn't there, you would imagine you'd get a bunch of, hey, look at me,

294
00:22:42.04 --> 00:22:48.36
I was such a badass in all these stories.

295
00:22:48.36 --> 00:22:54.40
Because I think that what you and life have and even this podcast and stuff, there's

296
00:22:54.40 --> 00:22:59.52
references to war, but it's not about, let me spend all the cool tales that the war that

297
00:22:59.52 --> 00:23:01.48
I went through and stuff like that.

298
00:23:01.48 --> 00:23:07.000
It's more about the actual principles of leadership and what you've affected.

299
00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:12.88
And the general public would probably want to hear every last cool story on how you saved

300
00:23:12.88 --> 00:23:17.60
this person or killed all these bags or whatever.

301
00:23:17.60 --> 00:23:18.84
Everyone will want to hear that.

302
00:23:18.84 --> 00:23:19.84
I'll do it.

303
00:23:19.84 --> 00:23:21.84
But that's not what it's about.

304
00:23:21.84 --> 00:23:25.44
That's not what you're going public with.

305
00:23:25.44 --> 00:23:31.80
It's more about this valuable stuff that is tried tested in the harshest conditions that

306
00:23:31.80 --> 00:23:33.44
work everywhere.

307
00:23:33.44 --> 00:23:35.56
That's the valuable part.

308
00:23:35.56 --> 00:23:42.56
I don't even know if that's even like seeking glory in any way.

309
00:23:42.56 --> 00:23:48.40
Well, again, I've said this before, you can say that you're not trying to seek glory,

310
00:23:48.40 --> 00:23:52.28
but then when you write out 300 page book about yourself, you know what I mean?

311
00:23:52.28 --> 00:23:54.20
And then you have a podcast about yourself.

312
00:23:54.20 --> 00:23:56.08
It's like it just is what it is.

313
00:23:56.08 --> 00:24:05.12
There's no, that has a level of self-centeredness that you can't, I mean, you can't,

314
00:24:05.12 --> 00:24:06.80
I can't deny it, right?

315
00:24:06.80 --> 00:24:07.80
I can't deny it.

316
00:24:07.80 --> 00:24:13.32
I actually know the podcast is it's a podcast and I talk on it for two hours, right?

317
00:24:13.32 --> 00:24:14.92
That's me talking.

318
00:24:14.92 --> 00:24:17.88
So there is a level of that that you can escape from.

319
00:24:17.88 --> 00:24:22.52
And I talked about this before, but that book, the electric cool aid asset test, which

320
00:24:22.52 --> 00:24:27.60
I don't, maybe I'll do, but it's about the hippies and the drug revolution.

321
00:24:27.60 --> 00:24:34.76
Well, this one part of it, where this guy is listening, he's up and hate Ashbury in San Francisco.

322
00:24:34.76 --> 00:24:44.28
And he goes on this tangent about how what they're saying is me, me, me, me, look at me.

323
00:24:44.28 --> 00:24:48.28
And when I read that for the first time, I was like, oh, I never want to be that person,

324
00:24:48.28 --> 00:24:49.28
that's saying that.

325
00:24:49.28 --> 00:24:55.28
And that's that, but again, the dichotomy here is I have a podcast, I have a book and

326
00:24:55.28 --> 00:24:58.08
the book is me and the podcast, me.

327
00:24:58.08 --> 00:25:04.36
And so it's unavoidable to have a podcast that you talk on and not have it somehow

328
00:25:04.36 --> 00:25:06.40
be about you, it just doesn't happen.

329
00:25:06.40 --> 00:25:09.24
So that's a real challenge.

330
00:25:09.24 --> 00:25:14.52
And I do my best to mitigate that, but you can't stop it.

331
00:25:14.52 --> 00:25:18.52
It is factually a podcast that I'm in.

332
00:25:18.52 --> 00:25:22.12
It is factually a book that I wrote.

333
00:25:22.12 --> 00:25:23.12
Right.

334
00:25:23.12 --> 00:25:25.76
You know, it's a book that factually lay for wrote.

335
00:25:25.76 --> 00:25:29.12
So that's just what it is.

336
00:25:29.12 --> 00:25:31.24
And so you can't take those away.

337
00:25:31.24 --> 00:25:37.80
The only thing that mitigates that feeling from me is again what I just said is when

338
00:25:37.80 --> 00:25:45.72
you got, when I got soldiers, marine, or I got seal teammates in mind, that are fired up.

339
00:25:45.72 --> 00:25:48.36
And they're saying, hey, that was awesome.

340
00:25:48.36 --> 00:25:49.36
Thanks to that one.

341
00:25:49.36 --> 00:25:50.36
This was great.

342
00:25:50.36 --> 00:25:53.32
I never knew that or whatever they're going to say.

343
00:25:53.32 --> 00:25:54.32
Right.

344
00:25:54.32 --> 00:25:58.48
And then on top of that, you know, you get civilians that are saying, hey, I stopped using

345
00:25:58.48 --> 00:26:00.68
drugs because of your podcast.

346
00:26:00.68 --> 00:26:01.68
That is awesome.

347
00:26:01.68 --> 00:26:02.68
Yeah.

348
00:26:02.68 --> 00:26:03.68
I don't like drugs.

349
00:26:03.68 --> 00:26:08.24
And so when somebody tells me that they stop using drugs because of the podcast, that makes

350
00:26:08.24 --> 00:26:09.92
me feel very gratified.

351
00:26:09.92 --> 00:26:14.80
When somebody calls me up, I just had a, or somebody on Twitter just said a guy is like

352
00:26:14.80 --> 00:26:16.84
53 years old.

353
00:26:16.84 --> 00:26:20.56
And he said, hey, I've lost X amount of pounds, 40 something pounds.

354
00:26:20.56 --> 00:26:25.16
And he said, I just did the first legit pull up of my life.

355
00:26:25.16 --> 00:26:26.64
53 years old.

356
00:26:26.64 --> 00:26:30.04
53 years old just did the first legitimate pull up of his life.

357
00:26:30.04 --> 00:26:32.28
He's like, thank you.

358
00:26:32.28 --> 00:26:41.08
That is worth the, the, the daggers that stick me in my brain because I know I sold out.

359
00:26:41.08 --> 00:26:42.08
Yeah.

360
00:26:42.08 --> 00:26:43.36
I sold out.

361
00:26:43.36 --> 00:26:46.16
But that's what it is.

362
00:26:46.16 --> 00:26:51.96
Is it just in your, I mean, do you get like scrutiny from people at all for quote unquote

363
00:26:51.96 --> 00:26:53.36
selling out or is it not?

364
00:26:53.36 --> 00:26:55.48
Or do you think, yeah, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my,

365
00:26:55.48 --> 00:27:02.38
my, my, my, my I'm frozen the teams are part, they're, they're, they're, they're right that's

366
00:27:02.38 --> 00:27:05.38
what I would think, and it is because the whole dynamic.

367
00:27:05.38 --> 00:27:06.28
I mean, yeah.

368
00:27:06.28 --> 00:27:08.14
I mean, you got as be like, jokalo podcast.

369
00:27:08.14 --> 00:27:09.14
It's called jokalo podcast.

370
00:27:09.14 --> 00:27:11.76
It's about me you kind of have to do that.

371
00:27:11.76 --> 00:27:12.26
Yeah.

372
00:27:12.26 --> 00:27:12.70
I mean, there's, there's a small element of that that you have to include about yourself.

373
00:27:12.70 --> 00:27:18.82
The credibility reasons are this stuff, but then aside from that it's, it's valuable stuff.

374
00:27:18.82 --> 00:27:19.80
It's not glorious.

375
00:27:19.80 --> 00:27:20.80
You can stuff it all.

376
00:27:20.80 --> 00:27:22.14
This is like stuff that's helpful.

377
00:27:22.14 --> 00:27:23.02
They don't help.

378
00:27:23.02 --> 00:27:29.34
If you the stuff that you can benefit from from this podcast from the book if your neighbor

379
00:27:29.98 --> 00:27:34.94
If the people in your neighborhood all the incorporated these principles into their life it'd be a better neighborhood

380
00:27:35.34 --> 00:27:39.50
So it's not like you know, I'm just this you're looking me. I'm a warrior

381
00:27:39.66 --> 00:27:41.66
You know, it's not that no

382
00:27:41.98 --> 00:27:47.26
So it makes it worth I mean I mean I mean I did it though that like tradition if let's just say if there is like

383
00:27:47.82 --> 00:27:51.02
A person who's like hey, you know like a I did what you're doing but you shouldn't do that

384
00:27:51.02 --> 00:27:56.38
That's the code that's a tradition that's the you the code you sold out. I would understand that

385
00:27:56.38 --> 00:27:59.98
But I think that's just like you're not looking at the big picture. Yeah

386
00:28:00.86 --> 00:28:05.90
Yeah, no it definitely was when I hear back from when I hear like I said when I hear from actor

387
00:28:05.90 --> 00:28:09.66
Do you know it's when I hear from my seal bros that are that are telling me

388
00:28:10.38 --> 00:28:14.14
This is awesome that that's that makes it worthwhile to me and

389
00:28:15.18 --> 00:28:17.66
That's sort of why I keep doing it that and again

390
00:28:17.66 --> 00:28:24.62
These civilian folks that are out there that are that are just changing their lives and and again

391
00:28:24.62 --> 00:28:31.34
I whenever they say all thank you I say I didn't do anything you did it that guy that did his first pull-up his first legit pull-up and

392
00:28:31.34 --> 00:28:34.46
53 years of life you know what that's awesome

393
00:28:34.46 --> 00:28:38.06
I didn't do that pull-up. He did he had to put all the work and all he did was change that

394
00:28:38.06 --> 00:28:40.78
It didn't get in the game and now he's you know

395
00:28:40.78 --> 00:28:46.38
Haven't a much better situation in this life because your life is better if you go from zero pull-ups to one your life just got better

396
00:28:46.38 --> 00:28:53.82
Your life just got a lot better as a matter of fact. Yeah, so yeah, but but it was interesting as I sat here and talked about the cool

397
00:28:53.82 --> 00:28:56.54
When I thought about the question the biggest turnaround

398
00:28:56.54 --> 00:28:58.54
I've been really pretty

399
00:28:59.58 --> 00:29:04.46
Steady in my beliefs for a long time. I mean about this you mean no just in general

400
00:29:04.46 --> 00:29:09.02
Just like in general if you if you were to interview me now and you interviewed me 10 years ago

401
00:29:09.50 --> 00:29:11.18
They be close. I was probably a little bit

402
00:29:11.18 --> 00:29:19.26
Dumber 10 years ago as dumbed number six months ago, but my broad beliefs would be somewhat similar, right?

403
00:29:19.98 --> 00:29:23.18
And it's awesome thinking okay, what's the biggest turnaround and then I realized oh yeah

404
00:29:23.50 --> 00:29:27.66
Obviously this is a huge turnaround for me and and there were guys that you know

405
00:29:27.98 --> 00:29:31.02
When guys in the sealed teams found out that I had a book coming out

406
00:29:31.02 --> 00:29:36.30
There was definitely some guys that were like dude. What are you doing and I'll you know and then they'd read it and say

407
00:29:36.30 --> 00:29:44.22
Hey man, you know credit cool all good you know and that's the way it is let's say you were to

408
00:29:46.14 --> 00:29:48.14
Not rewind life, but you're

409
00:29:49.50 --> 00:29:51.50
Take the jockel from before

410
00:29:53.34 --> 00:29:54.70
Before Romadi how about that?

411
00:29:54.70 --> 00:30:02.94
Jockel from and then the idea was in jodos. Hey like what do you like what did you feel about that like if someone went and wrote a book and did you know

412
00:30:03.10 --> 00:30:05.02
Did it get something like what was your take-

413
00:30:05.02 --> 00:30:07.02
There's no podcast back then, but generally

414
00:30:07.90 --> 00:30:13.50
Generally negative. Yeah, that's that's why it's a big turnaround right because if you told me that years ago

415
00:30:13.50 --> 00:30:19.10
I'd be like, you know, we're quite professionals. We don't do that kind of thing. So here I am Mr. Quiet professional

416
00:30:19.58 --> 00:30:21.58
Yeah, that's okay. Not so quiet

417
00:30:23.18 --> 00:30:27.26
Still a professional though trying to keep a professional definitely trying to keep a professional

418
00:30:27.26 --> 00:30:35.98
I'm that it's good. Yeah, the is there you know how like some you know people who change their

419
00:30:36.46 --> 00:30:41.50
Attitude on things all the time sometimes get frowned upon this is just in general for being like a flip flapper

420
00:30:41.50 --> 00:30:47.98
Yeah, well like politics stuff, but isn't that kind of good if you're if your ideas about things always are updated

421
00:30:47.98 --> 00:30:50.86
Yeah, it's okay with me. I don't mind if people

422
00:30:50.86 --> 00:30:58.70
Change their opinion over time as they as they bring on new knowledge, but there's a point where that becomes ridiculous

423
00:30:58.70 --> 00:30:59.66
right

424
00:30:59.66 --> 00:31:04.62
Yeah, well, yeah, it kind of depends on why they're changing their mind. Yeah, sure, too

425
00:31:04.78 --> 00:31:10.06
So if it's like with the introduction of new facts and stuff like that and they're like, okay, I didn't know all that now

426
00:31:10.06 --> 00:31:13.42
You know it paints a broader you know, more after your pictures so now I feel this way

427
00:31:13.42 --> 00:31:17.02
We're starting to feel this way about but there's a there's a bias

428
00:31:17.02 --> 00:31:24.62
You know talk about how to advice called it's called a I think it's called backfire effect and it's the opposite so like new factual

429
00:31:24.78 --> 00:31:26.78
informational come in and

430
00:31:26.86 --> 00:31:31.58
The tendency is to be like is to dig deeper into your current belief. Oh for sure

431
00:31:31.82 --> 00:31:37.66
In fact, I can I can talk about that I've seen that happen before and when I've seen that happen as people

432
00:31:38.54 --> 00:31:42.14
When they the way that they first learn to do something in the seal teams

433
00:31:42.14 --> 00:31:47.26
Is the way they believe is correct and you have to beat it out of them

434
00:31:47.82 --> 00:31:50.70
Like like oh as we learn new tactics

435
00:31:50.94 --> 00:31:55.98
Whenever wherever some guy went to their first training at a seal team wherever they went and whoever taught them

436
00:31:55.98 --> 00:32:00.46
That's sort of what they believe and anyone else that comes in with a new idea will be oh

437
00:32:01.02 --> 00:32:06.62
Man, you don't know what you know, that's not the best way and so and I I figured that out real quick when I was in training

438
00:32:06.62 --> 00:32:13.98
When I was running training and I realized oh, oh, I got to get over this barrier of you know this guy learned it at this team or

439
00:32:14.22 --> 00:32:19.66
Wherever and or he learned it from this guy and so he's got to have that in his head that that's the only way to do things cool

440
00:32:19.66 --> 00:32:24.62
Just got to I wouldn't aggressively attack it of course. I'd say oh, yeah, that's a great tactic

441
00:32:24.62 --> 00:32:29.02
What they do yeah that this and you know what what we're about to show you actually mixes in with that tactic good

442
00:32:29.02 --> 00:32:30.06
You might want to you know

443
00:32:30.06 --> 00:32:35.34
It's something you could use along with your tactic and then they'd realize that the tactic we're teaching is superior

444
00:32:35.34 --> 00:32:41.98
Because we've evolved right I had to evolve we learned tactics new tactics all the time the fundamental principles didn't change

445
00:32:41.98 --> 00:32:46.86
But the execution at a tactical level would change because we got better up

446
00:32:46.86 --> 00:32:48.94
They did yeah, well, it's good. It's called war

447
00:32:49.02 --> 00:32:54.06
You know we went to war and as soon as we went to war we started figuring out some of the stuff where that we had been taught

448
00:32:54.46 --> 00:32:59.42
Didn't really function the way we it's it was literally like pre UFC martial arts. Yeah

449
00:32:59.42 --> 00:33:06.70
That's right, you know pre UFC martial arts if you learn that you know if I touch your neck in this particular

450
00:33:06.70 --> 00:33:11.82
Man or you're gonna fall down and nothing is gonna save you from that and if you get taught that

451
00:33:12.38 --> 00:33:15.74
You might believe it yeah and then somebody punches you in the face

452
00:33:16.30 --> 00:33:20.94
Or does a double leg take down and you and slaps you into the ground and then you get their knackers

453
00:33:20.94 --> 00:33:23.10
Yeah, when you try and karate chop their neck

454
00:33:23.10 --> 00:33:29.90
So it was the same thing in the sealed things we had tactics that had evolved during a peace time environment in a in a bubble

455
00:33:30.54 --> 00:33:36.46
And so when the war started we said, oh, okay, we need to we need to do an immediate check on all these things

456
00:33:36.46 --> 00:33:37.82
Yeah

457
00:33:37.82 --> 00:33:43.58
My friend was in from out of town in this past weekend. We watched the fights and the guys were in this specific position

458
00:33:44.62 --> 00:33:47.66
You know standing kind of from the back there and he and he asked

459
00:33:48.86 --> 00:33:50.22
He's like hey

460
00:33:50.22 --> 00:33:55.58
Couldn't he just like throw knees and give him like the meanest Charlie horse right there and then agree like

461
00:33:56.62 --> 00:34:01.26
It's not we'll say it's not condescending or anything but if you don't know you don't know yeah, it's like

462
00:34:02.54 --> 00:34:04.54
So we said

463
00:34:04.54 --> 00:34:07.66
No, I mean yeah, you could but that wouldn't do anything

464
00:34:07.66 --> 00:34:09.58
I mean, I don't think you even feel that you know

465
00:34:09.58 --> 00:34:16.14
Not a UFC fight how I put it was I said Charlie horses are for when you're cruising and

466
00:34:16.14 --> 00:34:20.46
You see your friend you're like, oh, you're my friend Charlie horse and you do it and it like hurts

467
00:34:20.46 --> 00:34:24.54
I mean like oh, you know, but no when you're in fighting like yeah, you don't really feel it Charlie horse

468
00:34:24.54 --> 00:34:25.50
You know now

469
00:34:25.50 --> 00:34:29.74
That being said if somebody if you're in a position somebody starts dropping

470
00:34:30.30 --> 00:34:30.78
Yeah

471
00:34:30.78 --> 00:34:36.94
12 the six elbows onto your thigh and they're big enough and they're big and you're kind of stuck there

472
00:34:36.94 --> 00:34:41.82
You'll feel those you'll see a guy even in the UFC you'll see a guy make adjustments to move because he doesn't want to

473
00:34:42.30 --> 00:34:44.30
Get take you know 12 those shots

474
00:34:44.30 --> 00:34:48.62
That's not gonna be fun. Yeah my example was a leg kick so leg kick is essentially

475
00:34:49.58 --> 00:34:53.50
Can be like a Charlie horse. You know like you know how like if you're friendly Charlie

476
00:34:53.50 --> 00:34:57.26
Really know and that's the point yeah, the point is like

477
00:34:58.14 --> 00:35:02.78
What you would think is a common Charlie horse like with your friend or at school

478
00:35:02.78 --> 00:35:06.30
Whatever like oh like an elbow where you punch it or even you need it or whatever

479
00:35:07.34 --> 00:35:12.70
Is different than like the kind of Charlie horse that will be effective in yeah and but in a fight in an MMA

480
00:35:12.70 --> 00:35:14.70
It takes even

481
00:35:14.70 --> 00:35:18.30
99% of the time with leg kicks it does take multiple

482
00:35:18.30 --> 00:35:23.74
It takes rounds worth of leg kicks before you can actually affect the guy it might slow the guy down a little bit

483
00:35:23.74 --> 00:35:27.50
He's a little less apt to to have weight on that front leg or whatever

484
00:35:27.74 --> 00:35:32.86
But then you know you see there's been fights that have ended because third or fourth round the guys been kicked in the leg

485
00:35:33.18 --> 00:35:35.98
47 times and it's it's just

486
00:35:36.78 --> 00:35:38.78
Easy breaks yeah

487
00:35:38.78 --> 00:35:44.54
Yeah, it's just yeah again this one of those things like if you don't know you don't know

488
00:35:45.10 --> 00:35:47.10
It seems that's how it is and then

489
00:35:47.98 --> 00:35:50.78
Yeah, there's much in the world that looks like that

490
00:35:51.26 --> 00:35:54.30
In that if you don't know it seems like it'd be easy

491
00:35:54.86 --> 00:36:00.78
Yeah, and it's not easy and jiu-jitsu to classic or MMA is a classic example that but there's so many things

492
00:36:00.78 --> 00:36:02.78
I mean even a normal sport

493
00:36:03.66 --> 00:36:05.18
You know baseball

494
00:36:05.18 --> 00:36:10.22
Hey, how hard can be to hit that ball all sports x yeah all sports rock climbing

495
00:36:10.22 --> 00:36:13.18
You know you look at say all that dude what money just grabbed that thing right there

496
00:36:13.18 --> 00:36:16.30
Yeah, no hold on yeah, just hold on no doesn't work that way yeah

497
00:36:16.70 --> 00:36:18.46
Football like you know when they drop the ball

498
00:36:18.46 --> 00:36:22.94
Oh my gosh, you couldn't even get your balls right in his hands. Okay, so try you you're a football now

499
00:36:23.34 --> 00:36:25.34
Of course they're trained on the sand, but you you know

500
00:36:26.38 --> 00:36:31.26
That's kind of part of the point you know them being trained made it look like it's so easy you've seen it done on that

501
00:36:31.26 --> 00:36:36.06
Yeah, and what's interesting is when this transfers over into

502
00:36:37.02 --> 00:36:41.26
The interpersonal and the leadership realm and it's the same exact thing where

503
00:36:42.14 --> 00:36:46.86
If you don't know you don't know and you see people that are you know younger leaders or they're not very

504
00:36:46.94 --> 00:36:50.94
Experience and they'll be making the same kind of rookie mistakes or have the same kind of

505
00:36:52.46 --> 00:36:54.06
Of opinion of

506
00:36:54.06 --> 00:36:58.62
We won't we just tell them to do this. Oh, that's very easy. Why you tell them to can't tell them just don't do that

507
00:36:58.62 --> 00:37:03.10
You just tell them to do that. They're just not gonna listen to you because they don't have respect for you because you don't have

508
00:37:03.10 --> 00:37:04.70
Relationship you you have a built-in thing up yet

509
00:37:04.70 --> 00:37:11.26
So you can end up with the same thing in that aspect of life as you do in a war fighting aspect of life as you do in a sports

510
00:37:11.26 --> 00:37:15.34
As-meck-a-life. It's all the same. Yeah, you've got to learn the skills

511
00:37:16.14 --> 00:37:18.14
You got to practice the skills

512
00:37:18.14 --> 00:37:19.18
Yeah, too

513
00:37:19.18 --> 00:37:22.22
Even like shooting a gun. Yeah. Oh super easy, right?

514
00:37:22.22 --> 00:37:28.22
Yeah, let's see somebody knock out. You know, it's it's it's a skill. I mean it's easier

515
00:37:28.62 --> 00:37:30.62
It's obviously easier

516
00:37:31.18 --> 00:37:37.42
To kill someone with a gun than it is with a knife or with your bare hands. It's an easier method

517
00:37:38.14 --> 00:37:42.94
But yeah, you see you know you see this all the time you see little gun fights where people fire shoot

518
00:37:43.26 --> 00:37:48.38
20 25 rounds add another guy and they don't hit them and they're only ten feet away

519
00:37:48.38 --> 00:37:55.34
You know, so shooting is easier, but it it still is a skill. You know that you need to practice

520
00:37:55.34 --> 00:38:01.66
No man in this not to mention just all that like input they like just firing it, you know like on movies

521
00:38:01.74 --> 00:38:04.70
They got to be like one hand, you know whatever boom boom

522
00:38:05.90 --> 00:38:10.38
A more accurate representation of how we would go is like you know the kind of movies where the girl

523
00:38:10.38 --> 00:38:15.66
They they totally do mean women a lot of times when they the girl grabs the gun and she's like

524
00:38:15.66 --> 00:38:21.66
And she shoots it and then like it flies out of her hand. Oh, yeah, that's probably pretty accurate if you ever shot a gun

525
00:38:21.66 --> 00:38:28.22
Well, yeah, if someone's never shot a gun before yeah, the first time I ever took my wife to a range to to teach her shooting and she was kind of that way

526
00:38:28.22 --> 00:38:33.02
You know kind of scared and intimidated and she was kind of yeah, almost shaking a little bit and

527
00:38:33.82 --> 00:38:35.82
a half an hour later

528
00:38:35.82 --> 00:38:39.34
I had her doing quick draws from the holster gun and down targets

529
00:38:39.98 --> 00:38:43.10
I said yeah, you're over it now. I want you she's just shut up and reload my magazine

530
00:38:43.10 --> 00:38:50.06
Okay cool we got this you're seeing those videos online. I mean, I don't know how much time he's been watching videos online

531
00:38:50.06 --> 00:38:53.74
But they're more just for entertainment, but of people like shooting

532
00:38:54.62 --> 00:38:55.42
The

533
00:38:55.42 --> 00:38:57.10
Oh, it's a nice

534
00:38:57.10 --> 00:38:58.54
It's a good

535
00:38:58.54 --> 00:39:02.94
If I'm gonna spend time watching videos I'm watching the actual guys that are good that have some knowledge to put out on

536
00:39:02.94 --> 00:39:04.06
Right stuff so

537
00:39:05.02 --> 00:39:06.38
So check

538
00:39:06.38 --> 00:39:08.38
Although you can learn from watching somebody

539
00:39:08.38 --> 00:39:09.98
Yeah, what's the face for the shotgun?

540
00:39:09.98 --> 00:39:13.42
Well, where they shoot it wrong. All right awesome. Next question

541
00:39:14.38 --> 00:39:21.18
I had a few questions relating to my family life for guys who joined the seals my boyfriend is interested in taking the past

542
00:39:21.18 --> 00:39:24.38
This is coming from the girl. Oh, okay interesting

543
00:39:25.74 --> 00:39:31.58
Jocca you have mentioned being married while a seal was it hard on you on you and your wife and family

544
00:39:31.58 --> 00:39:33.58
It was for a newlywed

545
00:39:34.30 --> 00:39:38.86
That's the left candidate. That's the answer for soft special operations forces. There you go

546
00:39:38.86 --> 00:39:40.86
So

547
00:39:40.86 --> 00:39:43.42
This is actually this was two questions and basically

548
00:39:44.86 --> 00:39:51.34
From the other side and beat by the way everyone that's asked can I bring my wife on here my wife has given me the stern

549
00:39:52.06 --> 00:39:53.58
Negative

550
00:39:53.74 --> 00:39:59.82
She's not coming. You know why because she's legit quite professional. She's just legit quite professional. You don't want any of this

551
00:40:01.26 --> 00:40:04.06
Glory no, she did it just cuz she loves the job

552
00:40:04.06 --> 00:40:11.02
So my wife has said no and after and someone said you know I said went back and forth to somebody on social media

553
00:40:11.90 --> 00:40:12.94
And they said hey

554
00:40:12.94 --> 00:40:14.14
Flanker

555
00:40:14.14 --> 00:40:18.54
I Ben she's a she knows this game bro. She's not gonna get flanks super easy

556
00:40:18.94 --> 00:40:23.58
But what I'm doing is kind of playing a long-term game on playing some seeds and whatnot trying to get her

557
00:40:24.06 --> 00:40:28.78
Maybe to think about how she could help some other folks out there so you know we're trying to work through

558
00:40:29.18 --> 00:40:31.18
There is some flanking activity going on

559
00:40:31.18 --> 00:40:34.14
We're gonna see where it goes but this question

560
00:40:35.42 --> 00:40:39.26
Being married to a guy that's in special operations or in the sealed teams or whatever

561
00:40:40.86 --> 00:40:42.86
It is a hard life

562
00:40:43.50 --> 00:40:45.50
in many ways and

563
00:40:45.90 --> 00:40:52.06
You know the sealed teams we had a 90% divorce rate by the way a 90 and I think it's come down a little bit

564
00:40:52.06 --> 00:40:57.26
I'm not 100% sure. I don't know what the current numbers are today, but man when I was a young kid

565
00:40:57.26 --> 00:41:01.02
Everybody was divorced. You know guys were just getting married divorced all the time

566
00:41:01.66 --> 00:41:08.06
So here's the here's the couple things that I would tell you that I think made

567
00:41:09.74 --> 00:41:14.62
Made my marriage last right aside from my wife. You know awesome. Of course right first credit

568
00:41:15.82 --> 00:41:17.82
But here's a couple things

569
00:41:18.30 --> 00:41:19.18
number one

570
00:41:19.18 --> 00:41:24.30
You have to respect the fact that the job is the number one priority

571
00:41:24.30 --> 00:41:26.30
And

572
00:41:26.30 --> 00:41:31.10
That is completely different from one a lot of people think and I don't mean to be offensive by that

573
00:41:31.90 --> 00:41:36.62
By saying that but the job has to be number one and for me and I've said this before on interviews

574
00:41:36.94 --> 00:41:38.94
The job was the most important thing to me and

575
00:41:41.18 --> 00:41:47.02
My wife didn't take offense to that she didn't when I said I'm gonna work but it's Saturday doesn't matter

576
00:41:47.66 --> 00:41:49.98
You know, oh I'm going I'm gonna not gonna be coming home tonight

577
00:41:49.98 --> 00:41:57.34
Why I'm going to work and then I'm going out with my friends because we're gonna go and hang out because that's what we do

578
00:41:57.34 --> 00:42:02.62
You know and she never would get offended by that instead she realized okay

579
00:42:02.62 --> 00:42:05.98
Yeah, his job is the most important thing. He's got to take care of himself. He's got to take care of his guys

580
00:42:05.98 --> 00:42:08.70
He's got to take care of his job. He's got to take care of the country

581
00:42:09.42 --> 00:42:13.58
So I am number two. That's cool. You know what I need to do is help support him and so that is

582
00:42:14.46 --> 00:42:15.74
That is

583
00:42:15.74 --> 00:42:19.10
What was happening and and so what that means is your wife

584
00:42:19.10 --> 00:42:25.18
In this case you young lady that's asking this question you need to be an independent person right?

585
00:42:25.74 --> 00:42:26.94
You

586
00:42:26.94 --> 00:42:31.74
You need to be self-sufficient and and that's not just self-sufficient with

587
00:42:32.46 --> 00:42:33.66
You know

588
00:42:33.66 --> 00:42:35.66
being able to

589
00:42:36.06 --> 00:42:41.10
Clear the toilet when it gets clogged up and you know call the plumber when the

590
00:42:41.50 --> 00:42:47.50
Water heater breaks and handle all that administrative stuff and all the tasks around the house and provide you know

591
00:42:47.50 --> 00:42:50.22
Take care of the finances because your your husband's gonna be gone

592
00:42:50.54 --> 00:42:52.86
He's gonna be gone. He's gonna be on a work-up. He's gonna be

593
00:42:53.50 --> 00:42:59.98
It's gonna be gone a lot and so you gotta be able to handle all that stuff and on top of that you have to be self-sufficient emotionally

594
00:43:01.34 --> 00:43:07.02
Emotionally self-sufficient where you don't need to have this constant

595
00:43:08.70 --> 00:43:14.38
You know constant flow of affection coming from this guy who has a bunch of other things to worry about

596
00:43:14.38 --> 00:43:16.38
Yeah, right so

597
00:43:17.50 --> 00:43:21.74
That's hard to do and it's hard. I think that's one of the problems. I mean that's why

598
00:43:21.74 --> 00:43:24.30
There's probably a high divorce rate because it's hard to find a

599
00:43:25.10 --> 00:43:30.70
Girl or a woman that can do those things. Yeah, right so

600
00:43:31.74 --> 00:43:33.74
It's that that will make

601
00:43:34.14 --> 00:43:37.26
That's part of the solution here now the husband obviously

602
00:43:38.30 --> 00:43:40.30
big things you gotta do is

603
00:43:40.94 --> 00:43:43.90
Leave your job at work

604
00:43:43.90 --> 00:43:45.90
Right and

605
00:43:45.66 --> 00:43:46.94
Don't

606
00:43:46.94 --> 00:43:49.50
Don't bring it home with you. I've talked about this before you know

607
00:43:49.50 --> 00:43:53.82
Don't in the seal teams you don't have to you when you get done with work you change you put on your civilian clothes

608
00:43:54.38 --> 00:43:59.02
You go home so you're not bringing that with you. That's sort of a psychological

609
00:43:59.66 --> 00:44:04.54
Moment to change and and get those out but there's also the attitude

610
00:44:05.26 --> 00:44:07.26
That you can carry over very easily because

611
00:44:07.74 --> 00:44:13.66
This seal teams and and special operations in the military general with definitely the seal teams is a hostile

612
00:44:13.66 --> 00:44:16.54
Environment with your friends your friends are not

613
00:44:17.26 --> 00:44:19.26
supportive caring

614
00:44:19.58 --> 00:44:23.26
nurturing friends no your friends are just

615
00:44:24.86 --> 00:44:29.42
Just savages right everything they're looking for weakness. It's it's I mean it's all fun

616
00:44:30.54 --> 00:44:37.82
But it's all just a constant it's a constant just battle verbal battle verbal abuse all day long

617
00:44:38.14 --> 00:44:40.54
It's fun like we're having fun with it

618
00:44:40.54 --> 00:44:49.18
That's the six cents a humor you know when Tim Kennedy was on here and they made that movie rage for range 15 and all all that that like kind of sick twisted sense of humor is

619
00:44:49.18 --> 00:44:54.46
What you're living in and there's a real problem that occurs when you take that little six

620
00:44:54.46 --> 00:44:57.82
sense of humor and that abusive personality that you develop at work and you bring it home

621
00:44:57.82 --> 00:45:00.70
Yeah, that happened to me when I went to college and

622
00:45:02.22 --> 00:45:07.94
Also, I wasn't around any team guys anymore all day long no more team guys and then here

623
00:45:07.94 --> 00:45:08.94
I am

624
00:45:08.94 --> 00:45:17.34
And what do I do now? I come home from going to school all day which was annoying and then the first person I talked to because I didn't talk to anyone

625
00:45:17.34 --> 00:45:21.98
When I was school unless I was asking them a specific question about some knowledge or some

626
00:45:22.62 --> 00:45:26.06
Thing that was happening in a class other than that I didn't make any friends

627
00:45:27.74 --> 00:45:33.18
So I come home and I want to socialize what was the only way? I knew how to socialize with people cutting them down

628
00:45:33.18 --> 00:45:41.50
I'm abusing them and I that's a little bit strong, but you know definitely making comments and and trying to have a good time through

629
00:45:42.54 --> 00:45:48.30
Through cutting people down and so you know and I've talked about this before I think somebody's

630
00:45:48.94 --> 00:45:50.94
Kind of grabbed on to this, but you know for instance

631
00:45:51.66 --> 00:45:55.10
You know before I was going to college when I was just in the team. It's my wife would make dinner

632
00:45:55.10 --> 00:45:59.66
Whatever it is she makes it hey cool. Thank you appreciate it when I was going to school all of a sudden

633
00:45:59.66 --> 00:46:02.14
Not around team guys anymore. I want to have some fun when I come home

634
00:46:02.14 --> 00:46:04.14
And you know

635
00:46:04.14 --> 00:46:06.14
She'd cook me something and I would

636
00:46:07.42 --> 00:46:10.14
Have some comments about this right and and

637
00:46:11.34 --> 00:46:14.62
Eventually and it was very cool when she said this to me she didn't think of big deal

638
00:46:14.62 --> 00:46:16.62
She just goes hey, I'm not a team guy. You know, you know

639
00:46:16.62 --> 00:46:21.98
I think I said something about this dried chicken that's your name my wife has always had some issues getting moist

640
00:46:22.70 --> 00:46:28.78
Checked right it always I don't know she's paranoid about food poisoning when she cooks it man

641
00:46:28.78 --> 00:46:35.26
She cooks it big time. I mean she goes the distance right she will cook that thing until you know

642
00:46:35.26 --> 00:46:38.30
You're you got to bring a gallon of water to the table just to get through the meal

643
00:46:38.94 --> 00:46:42.14
So she's actually got a lot better the recent years

644
00:46:42.94 --> 00:46:46.38
So anyways back in the day I'd say she's say oh, you know

645
00:46:46.70 --> 00:46:51.66
I made you some chicken and I'd say oh can can you just go ahead and bring me three gallons of water to the table

646
00:46:52.54 --> 00:46:56.22
And then it was one of those comments that I made one time where she says you know, I'm not a team guy

647
00:46:56.22 --> 00:46:59.98
And I kind of laughed and I said oh my gosh look what I'm doing

648
00:46:59.98 --> 00:47:04.46
I'm treating her like a team guy and she's not a team guy. She doesn't need to be treated like that

649
00:47:05.02 --> 00:47:07.02
so I just put myself in check and

650
00:47:10.14 --> 00:47:11.98
Got myself under control and

651
00:47:12.14 --> 00:47:15.66
Treated my wife like the good person that she is so

652
00:47:16.62 --> 00:47:17.82
There's that

653
00:47:17.82 --> 00:47:18.86
There's

654
00:47:18.86 --> 00:47:23.10
Communication it's and this is this is weird thing because everyone's gonna say communication

655
00:47:23.10 --> 00:47:26.22
But my point here is don't expect communication

656
00:47:27.02 --> 00:47:32.06
Right don't expect to be engaged one of my buddies was married and

657
00:47:33.58 --> 00:47:38.06
We were going on to plant this is a long time ago. He was married. He had three three kids

658
00:47:38.38 --> 00:47:41.10
Been married to you married a high school sweetheart blah blah blah blah

659
00:47:41.10 --> 00:47:45.42
And he lived in Coronado where where the seal teams are he lived there and

660
00:47:46.70 --> 00:47:52.38
His wife he lived there with his wife and one day he dropped off his car. He had to get his car worked on or something like that

661
00:47:52.38 --> 00:47:54.38
And he said

662
00:47:54.94 --> 00:48:00.30
This is we've been at the seal teams for five years. He's married the whole time been a seal team one and one time he says to his wife

663
00:48:00.30 --> 00:48:03.74
Hey, you know he calls her that says hey can you come pick me up?

664
00:48:04.14 --> 00:48:06.54
Because we got to go somewhere bummer back and she goes yeah

665
00:48:06.86 --> 00:48:12.86
She says where are you he goes I'm at the team and she goes where is it and Coronado by the way is only like a mile long

666
00:48:12.86 --> 00:48:15.82
And and so it was a classic example of

667
00:48:16.46 --> 00:48:21.82
He never told his wife even where the buildings were or what he did or anything like that and that's just the way it was

668
00:48:21.82 --> 00:48:23.82
then

669
00:48:23.82 --> 00:48:24.82
a lot of

670
00:48:24.82 --> 00:48:31.98
Successful seal marriages that I've seen there's not a lot of hey this is what I did at work today and hey this guys a jerk and hey

671
00:48:31.98 --> 00:48:33.94
We're trying to make this happen. Hey. I got trouble for this

672
00:48:33.94 --> 00:48:38.62
So there's none of that there's just like work and then there's what we have right and I think

673
00:48:39.42 --> 00:48:44.46
That you've got to separate those two but what I'm saying is this idea of communication happening all the time

674
00:48:44.46 --> 00:48:45.90
It's not gonna happen all the time

675
00:48:45.90 --> 00:48:49.42
It's not gonna and I don't even know if it's I don't think it's beneficial when I was overseas

676
00:48:49.42 --> 00:48:54.62
I wouldn't call my you could you could call your wife you know basically every day if you want to I didn't call my wife every single day

677
00:48:54.62 --> 00:48:58.86
I don't want to call my wife every day it makes time slow down. It doesn't speed it up

678
00:48:58.86 --> 00:49:04.54
Just don't call call like once a week. That's what I call my life once a week. Hey, how you doing?

679
00:49:04.54 --> 00:49:06.54
I'm fine. How's everything at home?

680
00:49:06.54 --> 00:49:12.54
I would just ask her questions about home didn't didn't tell her anything that was going on ever and just said

681
00:49:12.54 --> 00:49:18.10
Oh, yeah, how's this? Oh, yeah, did you get the you know? How's the car and did you get the water heater fixed and how's the kids doing and it's going blah blah

682
00:49:18.10 --> 00:49:23.86
Ask her questions because otherwise you're gonna start talking about your world and then that's gonna make them worried and

683
00:49:23.86 --> 00:49:25.86
Concerned and everything else and you don't want that

684
00:49:27.54 --> 00:49:32.86
So you don't need to talk to somebody every single day that you do it. That's neediness

685
00:49:32.86 --> 00:49:34.54
That's emotional

686
00:49:34.54 --> 00:49:39.46
That's what I was talking about earlier with well with being emotionally independent, right?

687
00:49:39.46 --> 00:49:42.90
You got to be independent. You can't need that like security of a

688
00:49:42.90 --> 00:49:49.58
Call me and talk to me. No, actually. I'm not gonna call you. I'm not gonna talk to you. You go to your thing. I'm doing my thing

689
00:49:52.22 --> 00:49:56.02
You know on top of that I think it's cool if you want to set some goals, you know together

690
00:49:56.02 --> 00:50:00.56
Make a little team, you know you're trying to make some things happen. You're trying to make some financial goals

691
00:50:00.56 --> 00:50:03.84
There's some family goals, there's some house goals, you know

692
00:50:03.84 --> 00:50:09.82
We want to get new carpet. I want to put some new wallpaper up. We whatever, you know, I want to add a you know

693
00:50:09.82 --> 00:50:14.74
Disdo stuff and make those goals maybe make some to get two goals together

694
00:50:14.74 --> 00:50:18.78
That's always good my wife was really good at jujitsu

695
00:50:18.78 --> 00:50:23.82
She's kind of stopped training when she started having babies every 18 months and all that

696
00:50:24.22 --> 00:50:27.54
What but you know we we stab a blast training jujitsu all the time

697
00:50:27.74 --> 00:50:31.50
So I obviously recommend the jujitsu to help all relationships

698
00:50:33.26 --> 00:50:37.06
Working out together is another good one. You know even if you can't get the jujitsu together

699
00:50:37.06 --> 00:50:41.10
You can you can you can just work out you know work out together and

700
00:50:41.94 --> 00:50:45.06
That's cool and then you've got to give each other some space

701
00:50:45.46 --> 00:50:48.18
Right got to give each other some space the guy the guy

702
00:50:48.58 --> 00:50:53.02
He's a team guy. He's a special operations guy. He's gonna hang with us friends sometimes and that's the way it goes

703
00:50:53.38 --> 00:50:55.38
There's nothing wrong with that

704
00:50:55.38 --> 00:50:59.94
That's the way things work and you know what she's gonna go do the same thing so that's okay

705
00:51:02.26 --> 00:51:05.58
Yeah, so I think those the main things. You know JP when JP was on here

706
00:51:05.58 --> 00:51:12.50
He made a good point of put put each other first right pretty simple point that goes a long way

707
00:51:12.50 --> 00:51:18.26
Yeah, that goes a long way. Yeah, which is contrary to what I said which is like the team is gonna come first

708
00:51:19.06 --> 00:51:21.06
But that's your job and

709
00:51:22.06 --> 00:51:26.50
I think you can still put your team as the number one priority and doing your job as your number one priority

710
00:51:26.50 --> 00:51:28.70
Because that's that's the thing I said this a million times right

711
00:51:29.94 --> 00:51:31.94
Hey, listen darling

712
00:51:31.94 --> 00:51:36.98
The reason I have to do my job well is cuz this is what we do we fight and guys are gonna be trying to kill us

713
00:51:37.14 --> 00:51:40.54
So the best thing I can do for our relationship is stay alive

714
00:51:41.02 --> 00:51:45.90
Yeah, so that means and not only that, but I got these guys that also need to stay alive for their wives

715
00:51:45.94 --> 00:51:50.18
So we're gonna work hard. We're gonna train hard. We're gonna play hard. We're gonna know each other better

716
00:51:50.62 --> 00:51:58.46
We're gonna we're gonna bond and all those things are gonna happen and that's how I can best support this family is by kicking ass at my job

717
00:51:58.46 --> 00:52:04.06
And if you're a smart wife you'll go that makes sense to me and it'll be okay

718
00:52:04.06 --> 00:52:07.46
So in putting your job as a number one priority

719
00:52:07.46 --> 00:52:11.06
You're actually supporting the family and you're you're putting your world your

720
00:52:11.66 --> 00:52:13.66
spouse first

721
00:52:13.66 --> 00:52:18.06
Because you're trying to take care of yourself take care of your team so that you can come home when when

722
00:52:18.62 --> 00:52:20.62
It's time to come home. Yeah

723
00:52:21.90 --> 00:52:26.06
Yeah, JP made it I mean the put each other first. That's kind of like a

724
00:52:26.06 --> 00:52:28.06
Like

725
00:52:28.06 --> 00:52:33.14
Data it's like you got to remember that you know because you know all like you're on two different pages

726
00:52:33.14 --> 00:52:35.98
You know, yeah, you got to put you're gonna you're gonna remind yourself

727
00:52:35.98 --> 00:52:38.38
Yeah, yeah, but man it helps

728
00:52:39.02 --> 00:52:42.06
Helps a lot if you even doing that lately

729
00:52:43.26 --> 00:52:48.70
I like the audition. I like how JP put it, you know, we just put each other for us. It's real like dang that kind of

730
00:52:51.26 --> 00:52:53.26
Resonated

731
00:52:53.26 --> 00:52:58.54
Like using that word, but it resonated, you know where you like using that word. I don't know you know those words

732
00:52:58.54 --> 00:53:05.52
You know certain words just sound dumb coming out of your mouth. Is that one of them in my opinion? It comes sounds out of anyone's no out of my

733
00:53:05.52 --> 00:53:08.54
I think I sounded pretty good actually. Oh, thanks

734
00:53:11.02 --> 00:53:14.22
But yeah, that was a good good luck by the way good luck

735
00:53:15.22 --> 00:53:18.54
To these guys that are trying to get in the special operations community

736
00:53:18.54 --> 00:53:24.82
Obviously, obviously, I loved it and it was awesome for me and I'll tell you my wife

737
00:53:24.82 --> 00:53:30.26
There was definitely hard, man. It was a hard it's a hard path and when your husband's over on deployment and

738
00:53:30.90 --> 00:53:33.34
Your home and guys are coming home

739
00:53:34.06 --> 00:53:37.38
wounded or guys are getting killed overseas that that's

740
00:53:37.86 --> 00:53:44.90
That's gonna be that's hard and that's one of the things that I talk about the strength of the spouses and the

741
00:53:44.90 --> 00:53:52.30
Independence and be able to deal with those hardships when they come that's real stuff and so to the women out there that support these guys

742
00:53:53.30 --> 00:53:55.30
God bless you

743
00:53:56.26 --> 00:53:58.26
Yeah, that that point you made where

744
00:53:59.90 --> 00:54:04.54
I think it's probably just had it really a little bit when you treat your wife like a team guy, you know like how cuz

745
00:54:04.54 --> 00:54:09.000
That's how you used it like bonding with people you like and also in a way. It's like it's good. Yeah

746
00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:10.78
I treat it like good. Yeah, man

747
00:54:10.78 --> 00:54:16.42
It's not a dose is not a one-way street, man. He can be doing that. I do I had the same thing because that's how me and my brother

748
00:54:16.42 --> 00:54:21.38
We just that's it the whole thing is like you really make to make the funniest joke about the other guy, you know

749
00:54:21.38 --> 00:54:24.22
And then so Sarah was like our friend

750
00:54:24.50 --> 00:54:30.70
Even we got together, so she kind of and she would she didn't like that even from the beginning, but once you're kind of like in the relationship

751
00:54:30.70 --> 00:54:33.82
She kind of got a lot of and she constantly constantly like

752
00:54:34.54 --> 00:54:38.50
I'm not you're you know and of course. I'm not your brother

753
00:54:38.50 --> 00:54:45.52
Yeah, I'm not your brother my friend like that kind, you know, but but of course if you're not looking at it as like a two-way street

754
00:54:45.76 --> 00:54:48.98
You're like wait you should be happy. I'm treating you like this, you know

755
00:54:48.98 --> 00:54:52.48
This is my way of showing affection. Exactly right you should be happy, right?

756
00:54:53.50 --> 00:54:56.82
No, no, that's a different person. Yeah, you know

757
00:54:58.70 --> 00:55:00.70
Next question

758
00:55:02.26 --> 00:55:04.26
B. J. J. Question one

759
00:55:04.26 --> 00:55:07.26
B. J. J. Q. One?

760
00:55:07.26 --> 00:55:09.74
I don't know. It does mean question one. Yes. There you go

761
00:55:10.46 --> 00:55:22.30
What's the best ratio of drilling to sparring in question two is what do you do if you roll with someone new to Giu-Jitsu and they're over aggressive like the beast took over

762
00:55:23.02 --> 00:55:27.12
Can't they want to hurt people? I don't think they really do but the adrenaline rush takes

763
00:55:27.86 --> 00:55:29.86
Experience to manage

764
00:55:29.86 --> 00:55:37.02
What's a good what's a good approach on you know on the mat to let them know that they're being reckless and wasting energy without sounding like a douche

765
00:55:38.46 --> 00:55:42.40
All right, so question one the ratio of drilling to sparring

766
00:55:43.62 --> 00:55:49.72
I'm probably not the best person to ask this question because I like to roll nobody's the best person asked that question

767
00:55:49.72 --> 00:55:55.74
Maybe but I like to roll and I should probably drill more, but I like to roll the rolling is the funnest thing

768
00:55:55.74 --> 00:56:00.78
We were training yesterday and we got done training yesterday and we were sitting there. We were watching some other people training stuff

769
00:56:00.78 --> 00:56:02.78
And I was like man, I just love to do so fun

770
00:56:03.12 --> 00:56:08.92
What we do in our of rounds and so I just got done in an ice and man, do you see so fun it's so fun and

771
00:56:10.14 --> 00:56:15.14
So I like to roll and drilling is not as fun right when I said yeah, we did rounds

772
00:56:15.14 --> 00:56:17.14
That means we were just rolling for those of you that don't train

773
00:56:17.94 --> 00:56:24.38
Well first of all go train go find a place to train and by the way all these people that asked me questions about if they should train

774
00:56:24.38 --> 00:56:30.74
Yeah, yes, you should train you got a million different reasons why you shouldn't train like what was the one you just responded to somebody on social media

775
00:56:30.74 --> 00:56:34.98
It said you know, hey, what if the only option I have is a place with just white belts

776
00:56:34.98 --> 00:56:40.04
Even the instructors the white belt is it worth it? Yes, yeah, it's worth it go on YouTube

777
00:56:40.04 --> 00:56:43.94
You can learn a billion different moves on YouTube and go start rolling these other white belts

778
00:56:43.94 --> 00:56:47.26
And you guys were all gonna get better and you know who doesn't matter what the belts are

779
00:56:47.38 --> 00:56:53.46
So you know whether you're that person or whether you're the person that says hack and only make it once a week because I travel go once a week

780
00:56:53.46 --> 00:56:59.82
Yeah, you go if you're the person that says hey, man, I got you know this knee injury and I can only

781
00:57:00.78 --> 00:57:07.42
Roll like one day before it gets too sore. Okay roll one day and you know what if you can doesn't mean you have every time you get on the mat

782
00:57:07.42 --> 00:57:09.46
You don't have to go psycho right

783
00:57:09.70 --> 00:57:14.94
Which is what I guess we'll get to that question, but if you can't roll super hard

784
00:57:14.94 --> 00:57:19.38
Then just roll a little lighter and roll what you can and we get guys

785
00:57:19.38 --> 00:57:25.50
Some of our really dedicated you do guys they get hurt. They still come in trail. They can't even roll, but they'll come in

786
00:57:25.50 --> 00:57:30.54
Hey, man, let's just let me just work my whatever I can do let me work my own lock. You know, I that's a one motion

787
00:57:30.54 --> 00:57:33.54
I can do so I'm gonna work that that's cool. Um

788
00:57:34.26 --> 00:57:40.34
So I think you should drill more I think I should drill more, but I just like to roll so much and

789
00:57:40.34 --> 00:57:43.30
I'll tell you I think this does change a little as you get better because

790
00:57:43.30 --> 00:57:51.22
I mean obviously a black belt doesn't need to drill as much as a white belt does because a white belt has a lot more moves to learn

791
00:57:51.66 --> 00:57:52.66
but

792
00:57:52.66 --> 00:57:54.66
everybody

793
00:57:54.66 --> 00:58:01.02
Should drill more and I think if I was to say something like probably a third of the time you should be drilling maybe

794
00:58:03.10 --> 00:58:07.22
I'll take something else you learn to move drill it until you're good at it

795
00:58:07.22 --> 00:58:11.72
Then you won't need to drill it anymore and the other thing about drilling is and drilling is awesome

796
00:58:11.72 --> 00:58:15.30
drilling also I could drill a move 15,000 times

797
00:58:15.96 --> 00:58:19.60
drill only and when I go to roll somebody I won't be able to do it

798
00:58:19.60 --> 00:58:24.12
It doesn't mean you'll be able to do it and in fact I still got to do it a hundred more times live

799
00:58:24.44 --> 00:58:28.90
Against another real active human before I can pull the move off. That's the way it works

800
00:58:29.38 --> 00:58:33.28
Occasionally there's a few moves that either they are that simple or

801
00:58:33.88 --> 00:58:38.000
You have a natural ability to do them that does happen sometimes where like occasionally

802
00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:42.32
I'll get I there's some moves that just makes sense to me right and I'm always as soon as I learn

803
00:58:42.32 --> 00:58:46.66
I can do them. That's a rare. I mean it's that happens 10% of the time most of the time

804
00:58:46.66 --> 00:58:50.06
I learned something and I try it and I get stuff and then I got to try it again

805
00:58:50.06 --> 00:58:52.38
I got to make my own little adjustments to it and then I got to do it again

806
00:58:52.38 --> 00:58:54.38
then you that's the way you get to works

807
00:58:55.68 --> 00:58:57.68
So drill a bunch all right

808
00:58:58.08 --> 00:59:04.46
Quick question to someone that is going level seven psychopath on the mat seven the highest level

809
00:59:04.46 --> 00:59:09.50
Hmm 10 right I guess but seven is still we're not a hundred percent sure

810
00:59:10.14 --> 00:59:16.44
Level as I don't think it's been seen. It's not level one. Yeah, definitely not level one this guy is above normal psycho level

811
00:59:17.18 --> 00:59:19.18
I'll say this well above

812
00:59:19.86 --> 00:59:21.86
Normal psycho level so

813
00:59:22.50 --> 00:59:27.02
First of all if you're higher belt you just shot them down right you just shot them down small to them

814
00:59:27.74 --> 00:59:31.38
I like see if I get someone that's going really super crazy. I will

815
00:59:31.38 --> 00:59:38.18
I will immobilize them to where they cannot move and I will let the rage drain it all this time

816
00:59:38.18 --> 00:59:41.50
Yeah, I'll just let it drain out of them and all you know

817
00:59:42.22 --> 00:59:43.70
Just

818
00:59:43.70 --> 00:59:47.34
Let the rage train and then all submit them and then all submit them again

819
00:59:47.34 --> 00:59:50.34
And I'll just do that over and over again and then I'll probably just you know

820
00:59:50.34 --> 00:59:53.98
Have a little chat with them like hey, man. You just relax a little bit because all that all that

821
00:59:55.10 --> 00:59:59.26
Going crazy is not helping you get better at what we're trying to do here

822
00:59:59.26 --> 01:00:00.26
hmm

823
01:00:00.26 --> 01:00:02.26
now

824
01:00:02.26 --> 01:00:06.62
When you tell somebody you're actually tell them don't you strength of course those are the things that no one can

825
01:00:07.26 --> 01:00:10.46
Actually apply right very seldom can someone say

826
01:00:11.38 --> 01:00:17.14
You yeah, I guess hey man just relax and they go okay cool. And you have a nice roll. No, it doesn't happen. They go even harder

827
01:00:18.14 --> 01:00:19.82
so

828
01:00:19.82 --> 01:00:24.94
That's what you're gonna do you eventually just keep wearing them down and say hey, man, you know I'm telling you got a real action

829
01:00:24.94 --> 01:00:30.50
Not gonna see you're not gonna see as much if you're so going psycho now

830
01:00:30.50 --> 01:00:34.34
So that's if you're a high-arbote. That's what I do control them put them you know

831
01:00:35.18 --> 01:00:42.66
Force them to accept their fate and that will help them move down the path towards relaxation now if you're a lower-bout

832
01:00:44.86 --> 01:00:46.86
You can either

833
01:00:46.86 --> 01:00:48.54
Fight to the death which is fine

834
01:00:48.54 --> 01:00:54.22
I mean kind of join in their mayhem and if you want to do that that's okay, or you can work your technique right and get dominated so so

835
01:00:54.22 --> 01:00:57.98
Guy comes in and you know you talk about the same level, but he's a lot stronger than you

836
01:00:57.98 --> 01:01:02.88
He's going crazy and you just go okay, you know I'm just gonna work my technique the best of my I can and I'm not gonna

837
01:01:03.50 --> 01:01:07.66
Escalate this and you know what you're gonna get tapped out because you guys are at the same level

838
01:01:07.66 --> 01:01:12.02
But he's using all of the strength and you're not now you're gonna get better at you did so, but you're not gonna notice that for a while

839
01:01:13.34 --> 01:01:15.34
So what happens?

840
01:01:15.34 --> 01:01:19.76
You get caught up in their ego trip and you start going just as hard as they're going and that's way it works now

841
01:01:19.76 --> 01:01:22.76
If you can just say you know what I'm just gonna keep relaxing with this guy and eventually

842
01:01:22.76 --> 01:01:29.90
I'm gonna learn more than him and that will happen you will learn more than the first and that's going psycho and then you can put them to tap

843
01:01:32.86 --> 01:01:34.86
So

844
01:01:35.50 --> 01:01:37.50
You know all so I was

845
01:01:39.30 --> 01:01:43.88
Tim Ferriss sent some email out the other day and it had a quote on there

846
01:01:43.88 --> 01:01:45.88
from

847
01:01:48.32 --> 01:01:51.56
Leo Tolstoy and it said

848
01:01:52.60 --> 01:01:56.82
Everyone thinks of changing the world, but no one thinks of changing himself

849
01:01:57.32 --> 01:02:00.36
but and and I was like

850
01:02:00.68 --> 01:02:07.60
That's interesting and I immediately thought of the jitter because I tried explain this concept people in jitter and that is

851
01:02:08.04 --> 01:02:12.92
When you're going especially again someone that's bigger than you are stronger than you or someone that's going crazy

852
01:02:12.92 --> 01:02:14.92
And they're using all of their muscles

853
01:02:15.20 --> 01:02:20.56
the way this translates in jitter is in jitter to everyone thinks of moving the other person

854
01:02:21.92 --> 01:02:29.76
But what you need to focus on is moving yourself and there's some really clear examples of this and but this is just translates in life

855
01:02:30.04 --> 01:02:35.54
It translates in the life you know, it's this is what flanking is right if I come up against you and you got a big ego and you're not budget anything

856
01:02:35.54 --> 01:02:40.18
I'm not gonna continue attack that way. I'm not gonna try and move you remove myself into a better position

857
01:02:40.18 --> 01:02:42.68
So I thought that was a

858
01:02:43.56 --> 01:02:48.94
Good thing to think about you when you're rolling with somebody that's big and going crazy. Yeah, that's a good point

859
01:02:48.94 --> 01:02:52.38
That's a good thing to think about all day every day about everything

860
01:02:52.66 --> 01:02:58.40
Especially you know people who are agree who are like hey, man, I need a job and that's you know

861
01:02:58.40 --> 01:03:06.34
That's nothing this is nothing new where I think I need a job, you know, dang there's no job that here or whatever and that's kind of an example of that, you know

862
01:03:06.46 --> 01:03:08.46
where

863
01:03:08.46 --> 01:03:14.20
Don't look at it like a job needs to be presented to you, you know, you have to kind of you need to maneuver

864
01:03:14.20 --> 01:03:17.34
Yeah, yeah change yourself so you know you can

865
01:03:18.30 --> 01:03:21.30
Do the work that people need you know

866
01:03:22.82 --> 01:03:27.70
Conquer don't move the world move yourself don't try and move your opponent move yourself

867
01:03:28.18 --> 01:03:34.74
Yeah, the guy or drilling and sparring you were kind of trying to move me a lot yesterday FYI

868
01:03:34.74 --> 01:03:40.38
I moved you know you were trying to move me a lot whatever you were coming with a really aggressive

869
01:03:41.10 --> 01:03:43.50
Really aggressive methodology I would say yeah

870
01:03:44.78 --> 01:03:49.22
default the default the aggressive the drilling

871
01:03:51.02 --> 01:03:54.68
It by experience if you ask if you thought you were getting frustrated

872
01:03:55.20 --> 01:03:59.06
That was and and I saw it's like okay, he's getting frustrated and I thought to myself

873
01:03:59.22 --> 01:04:01.46
He's getting frustrated at me

874
01:04:01.46 --> 01:04:07.14
You know and the reason I was like I I almost fell into your game

875
01:04:08.06 --> 01:04:12.66
Psychologically because as we're rolling and you're getting more and more frustrated

876
01:04:12.66 --> 01:04:20.38
So you're being more aggressive and part of your it seemed to me part of your frustration and your aggression was that I was

877
01:04:21.22 --> 01:04:26.90
Not fully disengaging but I was not getting into this game that you were in and

878
01:04:26.90 --> 01:04:31.66
And as I saw that you were gonna keep coming with us and and I said well, you know

879
01:04:31.66 --> 01:04:34.000
I don't want him to get frustrated, you know at me

880
01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.38
So maybe I'll play this a little bit and then I said oh wait

881
01:04:37.06 --> 01:04:42.18
I'm truly actually doing your jits. I'm doing your jits. I'm just straight doing your jits

882
01:04:42.18 --> 01:04:47.62
I'm not I'm totally not getting into this head banging competition normally be over here

883
01:04:47.62 --> 01:04:55.28
You know I'm gonna be over here so I thought that was isn't that kind of wet and I black it's actually really good how that worked because if you remember I

884
01:04:57.58 --> 01:05:01.34
Kind of start to lose it mentally not like temperalizer nothing but

885
01:05:02.10 --> 01:05:08.26
Like basically there's like a there's like a little small short list. I don't know if you know this I've mentioned this

886
01:05:09.26 --> 01:05:13.22
Not in this depth. There's a small list of things that I'm working on with you

887
01:05:13.22 --> 01:05:15.54
It's like a small thing like where if I can

888
01:05:15.54 --> 01:05:17.54
Remembrance do this, you know because

889
01:05:18.26 --> 01:05:22.82
You're the kind of word like you to defend a certain thing you got to focus really hard and defending it

890
01:05:22.82 --> 01:05:29.02
But the the drawback to that is when you start like really focusing on defending it all it takes is one little

891
01:05:29.02 --> 01:05:30.78
Yeah, so

892
01:05:30.78 --> 01:05:35.46
There's like a few things that is like dang I get it it's like a balancing act. Yeah, I don't want to forget here

893
01:05:35.46 --> 01:05:37.46
I don't want to forget here. You know, so it's like that and

894
01:05:38.46 --> 01:05:43.90
A lot of times then it's it's by my own evaluation. It's not based on like X it's in my own head like okay

895
01:05:43.90 --> 01:05:46.50
Like I feel good about this is coming along, you know kind of thing and

896
01:05:47.82 --> 01:05:50.74
Whether you notice this or not towards towards the end

897
01:05:51.38 --> 01:05:57.78
Like it might it like it was just done gone the whole my whole thing is just gone. Yeah, it's all just

898
01:05:58.34 --> 01:06:00.34
Blight grade

899
01:06:01.06 --> 01:06:06.42
That's what I was truly thinking I was thinking I was thinking he's getting mad at me

900
01:06:07.02 --> 01:06:11.42
But I'm really doing actual like the purest form of jiu-jitsu

901
01:06:11.42 --> 01:06:16.66
Which is hey you keep coming with all that and I'm just gonna keep adjusting and making other things happen

902
01:06:16.66 --> 01:06:19.42
Yeah, it's like it's like it's like this cycle

903
01:06:20.42 --> 01:06:25.22
That was fun, but yeah, it was good though. We're all thinking that the drilling

904
01:06:28.58 --> 01:06:31.34
Different people of different philosophies on undriling yeah

905
01:06:32.18 --> 01:06:35.42
Because I mean like surfing you know like okay when you drill and move this like

906
01:06:35.42 --> 01:06:41.22
Okay, do the armor you know do the whole transition to the arm bar and then you know just drill that when you first learn the arm bar

907
01:06:41.22 --> 01:06:46.86
It's gonna have more value because you have to just know the fundamental movement of the arm bar

908
01:06:47.06 --> 01:06:52.54
Just like how you said like it's gonna be different when you do it life. Do it life. Yeah, so

909
01:06:53.10 --> 01:06:56.02
Once you kind of get the fundamental movement of the arm bar

910
01:06:56.02 --> 01:07:00.62
You legs gotta be here. They gotta do this certain thing your arms position his thought all this all that stuff

911
01:07:00.62 --> 01:07:02.14
Once you kind of get that down

912
01:07:02.14 --> 01:07:08.34
It's like man you step into the value being now you gotta know when to do it. How to so you know

913
01:07:08.34 --> 01:07:13.38
I don't know if I'm gonna say this before on the podcast. I've said it when I've taught when I teach you to do this

914
01:07:13.38 --> 01:07:18.70
Something I say okay, there's let's say 10 things that you have to do right to make a move work

915
01:07:19.30 --> 01:07:21.30
Okay 10

916
01:07:21.30 --> 01:07:26.94
Got to put your arms here. You got to put your hips here. You got to put your grip here or whatever those 10 things are that you got to do

917
01:07:26.94 --> 01:07:31.94
I can teach you about four of them. You know, okay?

918
01:07:31.94 --> 01:07:40.54
Maybe I can teach you five maybe Jeff Glover or Dean or are a good instructor can teach you six or seven

919
01:07:40.54 --> 01:07:43.10
Maybe even eight of those components

920
01:07:43.62 --> 01:07:49.60
There's two more components. You're only gonna figure out on your set on your own. You're only gonna figure out where to distribute

921
01:07:49.60 --> 01:07:53.18
You wait by yourself. You're only gonna describe you how to time

922
01:07:53.62 --> 01:07:57.38
What the execution the move is by yourself. You're only gonna figure out

923
01:07:57.38 --> 01:08:03.70
How to feel what the other person and when they're vulnerable to the move you're only gonna get those by doing it live

924
01:08:03.70 --> 01:08:06.50
All only gonna be doing it getting it by doing it live

925
01:08:06.74 --> 01:08:10.96
So those are the components and you know there's more than 10 actually there's probably like

926
01:08:11.30 --> 01:08:14.10
80 yeah, that's a little components that you have to do and

927
01:08:14.90 --> 01:08:21.06
And what's cool is when you really focus on a particular move you have you have all these components just

928
01:08:21.44 --> 01:08:24.26
Lock solid and when someone's really good at a certain move

929
01:08:24.26 --> 01:08:29.54
Yeah, they just like there's so there's so there's they've been in that situation so many times

930
01:08:29.54 --> 01:08:33.50
Yeah, they've been in that situation so many times that it doesn't matter

931
01:08:33.50 --> 01:08:36.62
They you're doing something they already thought of that they've done they've been in that position

932
01:08:36.98 --> 01:08:41.62
Like there's a position in GJ2 for those either don't know there's a position in GJ2 called a 50 50

933
01:08:41.62 --> 01:08:47.86
Which we originally called Cochoreco, which Dean kind of I would say started because

934
01:08:48.38 --> 01:08:53.30
He did it in ADCC in 2003 and it was a position that we were doing all the time at that time

935
01:08:53.30 --> 01:08:58.82
But no one else was doing it and now a bunch of people do it Ryan Hall's made it famous and he's the one I think he

936
01:08:58.82 --> 01:09:05.10
Going out and who going to phrase 50 50 but he's got a academy called 50 50. Yeah, thin there. It's good nice

937
01:09:05.30 --> 01:09:10.22
So so but it's a position where you're fairly neutral your leg positions are neutral

938
01:09:10.22 --> 01:09:12.58
So you're you have the same leg position and

939
01:09:13.14 --> 01:09:20.50
So it's who knows the position better will win and so this position that they call 50 50 now, which we used to call Cochoreco

940
01:09:20.50 --> 01:09:25.26
It's actually Dean calls it 90 10

941
01:09:26.06 --> 01:09:31.30
Meaning hey, I yeah, I have a 90 percent chance or you have a 10 percent chance because I've spent months

942
01:09:32.14 --> 01:09:34.14
Sitting in this position so

943
01:09:35.62 --> 01:09:42.70
When you get someone that really knows a position well that puts you at a massive disadvantage if you're going against them

944
01:09:43.62 --> 01:09:47.50
Yeah, because you guys both know the drilling part of it, you know, but

945
01:09:47.50 --> 01:09:54.42
Those you know is the one million different other elements in light like surfing you know like you know when you first take surfing

946
01:09:54.42 --> 01:09:59.10
They're like hey, you know, let's do it on the sand when there's and there's it's just that's basically drilling

947
01:09:59.10 --> 01:10:04.50
Oh, yeah, you're understanding up and yeah, I don't know then you got to go out to the actual ways and then the waves

948
01:10:04.78 --> 01:10:13.70
That's you know, it's different and again these principles from GJ2 are they applied to everything that you do it and when you're going through a leadership situation

949
01:10:13.70 --> 01:10:21.70
If you've seen it before if you've seen this kind of person's added like I just told that story about hey, it's the guy that's learned something

950
01:10:21.70 --> 01:10:25.06
The first way he learned it in the seal teams is the way he believed it show is big

951
01:10:25.38 --> 01:10:32.000
One side experience that it was much easier for me to handle you know, so anytime you can open up your mind and pay attention on what's going on around you

952
01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:37.26
It's going to make you better at handling all these different situations that you come across in any environment

953
01:10:37.26 --> 01:10:43.82
This absolutely leadership environment you get the person with the giant ego you get the person that's that wants to take over you get the person that's

954
01:10:43.82 --> 01:10:47.02
I'm scared to step up you get all those things you get someone that's being

955
01:10:47.66 --> 01:10:51.06
Disrespectful how you gonna all I've had that before let's just go let me approach it

956
01:10:51.06 --> 01:10:57.90
You know what I mean? So the more you get to handle these different positions or the more you can research them and drill them because the drilling does pay off

957
01:10:57.90 --> 01:11:04.12
You know that's what all this gathering of trying to gather knowledge from various books

958
01:11:04.12 --> 01:11:10.74
Anyone you see something in a military situation like I see all these things in a military situation. I go, okay. Oh, I see what they did here

959
01:11:10.74 --> 01:11:13.84
Oh, I see what hack worth did here. I see what patent did here now

960
01:11:13.84 --> 01:11:17.08
I'm though patent. I'm gonna hack worth but at least I have a hands-up

961
01:11:17.08 --> 01:11:22.12
Yeah, at least I see the scenario before I've gone through a mental drill of how I handled now

962
01:11:22.12 --> 01:11:24.52
There's components that I need to figure out on my own

963
01:11:25.88 --> 01:11:31.74
But I've got the bulk of the move there. Yeah, I recognize what's happening

964
01:11:31.74 --> 01:11:37.14
It puts me at a little better situation than having no idea what's happening and just getting flanked

965
01:11:38.66 --> 01:11:40.16
Potentially

966
01:11:40.16 --> 01:11:44.90
Yeah, very much and then I get it nuts rolling the spas. Mm-hmm

967
01:11:44.90 --> 01:11:49.18
For that guy, by the way, it's it's a spas. Yeah white belt warrior. Yes sure there's that

968
01:11:50.34 --> 01:11:54.44
I think that's overall just kind of part of the game. There's so many different ways to like deal

969
01:11:54.44 --> 01:11:57.50
I mean as a higher belt. I mean you you kind of I mean

970
01:11:57.50 --> 01:12:01.88
I don't think you have the crystal knowledge, but you're you've been a high belt for a long time. So

971
01:12:03.14 --> 01:12:07.98
My average me personally has an individual. Yeah, yeah, so okay when you get a guy who's like

972
01:12:08.30 --> 01:12:13.96
When you first start like my memory is the first starting and going with big big strong guys who are getting nuts

973
01:12:13.96 --> 01:12:18.38
It's it is hard to deal with that straight-up like yeah, and if you're smaller

974
01:12:18.78 --> 01:12:21.86
It's even you know, it's even harder and you could go a little man

975
01:12:21.86 --> 01:12:28.56
You just it doesn't work right if you don't if you're a blue belt and you get a 200 if you're a 160 pound blue belt and a

976
01:12:28.56 --> 01:12:30.86
3-hunt or a 280 pound

977
01:12:31.42 --> 01:12:34.14
College wrestler comes in and it's his first day

978
01:12:34.78 --> 01:12:37.86
You're not going to be a man. You just a very good chance. You might be able to catch him

979
01:12:38.42 --> 01:12:43.70
You might be able to catch him. Yeah, but it's no guarantee. No, it's unlikely to

980
01:12:44.42 --> 01:12:49.46
Yeah, it's it's hard to core. Yeah, yeah, and that's part of the feeling

981
01:12:49.46 --> 01:12:59.94
You know, yeah, but now maybe a blue belt maybe a little challenging purple belt. You now purple belt. Yeah, you start different ball game see the holes. Yeah, yeah, but those and yeah if you're

982
01:13:00.98 --> 01:13:06.10
And I'm just completely speaking just from experience and thinking of it right now, but

983
01:13:07.22 --> 01:13:11.22
There are little things that you'll see come forward like little tactics

984
01:13:11.22 --> 01:13:15.50
You can use to someone who's just bigger stronger and spasin little tactics

985
01:13:15.50 --> 01:13:21.98
And not to say that you'll like you know end up tapping them out or whatever, but certain things that will be successful in your

986
01:13:22.22 --> 01:13:28.14
Situation so all you do is you kind of remember those things kind of work on that and wait to you see the next little thing

987
01:13:28.14 --> 01:13:30.46
Okay, then after a while is your game develops

988
01:13:30.46 --> 01:13:34.86
It'll be like oh shoot you have this handful of things that works on these types of guys. Yes, you know glove

989
01:13:35.74 --> 01:13:37.74
He he he he like does best

990
01:13:38.46 --> 01:13:44.62
Against he goes yeah guys that are big and strong are you know sort of his his game matches really well against them

991
01:13:44.62 --> 01:13:49.02
Against Jeff because he just so fluid. Yeah, yeah

992
01:13:50.14 --> 01:13:50.94
All right

993
01:13:50.94 --> 01:13:59.58
Druckle like yourself. I tend to have low opinions slash expectations of people my question is how do you act friendly with someone

994
01:13:59.98 --> 01:14:03.26
When you know they're trying to play passive aggressive power games with you

995
01:14:06.22 --> 01:14:13.86
Say say you know person and you know is a snake, but social and work situations demands and expects that you act like their friend

996
01:14:13.86 --> 01:14:15.86
How do you reconcile that within your mind

997
01:14:17.46 --> 01:14:22.34
Is that more is that not being fake? I know you're gonna say play the game, but

998
01:14:23.86 --> 01:14:27.38
But do I really have to play these snake games just to get ahead in the world?

999
01:14:28.58 --> 01:14:37.10
All right, so first of all from the first part of that this this Blake and statement that I have a low opinion of people is actually

1000
01:14:37.10 --> 01:14:44.46
factually not true. I don't come out of the gate with a low opinion of people that's actually not true. I have

1001
01:14:45.18 --> 01:14:47.58
I hope for people that they're gonna do well, but I don't have

1002
01:14:47.98 --> 01:14:53.34
Expectations that they're gonna perform there's a difference there, right? I don't view people in a low

1003
01:14:53.34 --> 01:14:55.34
Am I opinion of people is not low

1004
01:14:55.58 --> 01:15:01.34
Out of the gate, but I don't layer heavy expectations on them because that's unfair

1005
01:15:02.94 --> 01:15:04.94
So that's number one

1006
01:15:04.94 --> 01:15:14.26
I set the bar low so people can pleasantly surprise me, but believe me. I don't have a low expectation or a low opinion of people now the question yes

1007
01:15:15.62 --> 01:15:20.18
You absolutely called it and what I was going to say play the game

1008
01:15:21.10 --> 01:15:25.58
Right, yes, that's what you're gonna do now. Let me let me put this one

1009
01:15:26.90 --> 01:15:28.90
You got snakes

1010
01:15:28.90 --> 01:15:32.46
Okay, if you don't learn to play with the snakes

1011
01:15:32.46 --> 01:15:38.46
You're never gonna get the anti-vendom from their fangs. You're never gonna get them figured out

1012
01:15:38.94 --> 01:15:42.54
And if you don't figure out how to get the anti-vendom the snake's are always gonna own you

1013
01:15:43.50 --> 01:15:47.66
So you got to learn how to deal with snakes. I could kid was a team to

1014
01:15:48.34 --> 01:15:53.66
kid from Arkansas or something and we were out in the hills somewhere and there was a rattlesnake

1015
01:15:53.66 --> 01:15:56.94
And he grabbed that thing like he was picking up a like he was picking up a

1016
01:15:56.94 --> 01:16:02.86
A pair of socks it was like no factor boom walked over picked up the snake whacked it against the tree

1017
01:16:02.86 --> 01:16:08.46
I said okay, that knows how to deal with snakes and it's the same thing here people are snakes

1018
01:16:08.46 --> 01:16:11.50
Does that mean you just avoid them and you're not gonna play the game and the worst thing

1019
01:16:11.50 --> 01:16:13.10
You know what you don't do with the snake?

1020
01:16:13.10 --> 01:16:18.06
You don't walk over and get all like intimidate him and get in their face and so it bites you

1021
01:16:18.06 --> 01:16:21.90
You know and and poisoned you right so

1022
01:16:21.90 --> 01:16:26.94
Yes, you got to play the game people like this exist

1023
01:16:28.06 --> 01:16:30.46
Right and and so let's say let's take a

1024
01:16:33.02 --> 01:16:39.90
Let's say you take the moral high ground and you refuse to work with an accepting B humane with these snakes

1025
01:16:40.70 --> 01:16:42.70
Okay, if that's what you do

1026
01:16:43.10 --> 01:16:45.34
Now guess what now this snake don't like you

1027
01:16:46.38 --> 01:16:49.50
Now they see you as a threat and now they attack

1028
01:16:49.50 --> 01:16:51.50
And

1029
01:16:51.50 --> 01:16:56.30
Like I said this is when they bite in a poison and they kill you and what good are you now your dead

1030
01:16:58.70 --> 01:17:04.14
So you can't help anybody when you're dead you can't achieve your goals. You can't help the team you can't accomplish the mission

1031
01:17:05.42 --> 01:17:07.42
Because you are on the moral high ground

1032
01:17:08.86 --> 01:17:10.86
Now let's say that you learn to play the game

1033
01:17:12.70 --> 01:17:16.94
You learn how to handle those snakes like that young boy from our from Arkansas

1034
01:17:16.94 --> 01:17:23.34
You learn their moves you get the antidote you get the anti venom for their poison

1035
01:17:25.02 --> 01:17:28.38
And you actually in this process you become immune to their attacks

1036
01:17:30.46 --> 01:17:33.74
And you reach a point where they actually don't attack you

1037
01:17:34.62 --> 01:17:36.62
Because they're familiar with you

1038
01:17:38.22 --> 01:17:40.22
And they trust you and

1039
01:17:40.94 --> 01:17:42.94
When that happens

1040
01:17:42.94 --> 01:17:50.14
Then you can overcome their weapons you can rise up you can get control of them and you can utilize them for your own

1041
01:17:50.46 --> 01:17:52.46
purpose right now

1042
01:17:53.26 --> 01:18:01.18
If that purpose was something that was self-centered or something that was for your own good and not for them or not for the team then it'd be a form of manipulation

1043
01:18:01.42 --> 01:18:02.94
And it'd be pretty negative

1044
01:18:02.94 --> 01:18:07.74
But if all you're doing is trying to get these snakes on board with the program to help the whole team win

1045
01:18:07.98 --> 01:18:09.98
We got no issue with that

1046
01:18:09.98 --> 01:18:17.50
We got no moral issue with that. I got no moral issue with me treating people nicely to try and get them on board with the program so that they can help our team win

1047
01:18:17.50 --> 01:18:20.14
I got no issue with that more or other ones

1048
01:18:21.34 --> 01:18:23.34
So

1049
01:18:24.22 --> 01:18:27.74
That's the answer I think you know when the time is right

1050
01:18:28.78 --> 01:18:33.34
You be nice to those snakes when the time is right you put that little stick with the new surround the end of it

1051
01:18:33.34 --> 01:18:36.22
You put it around the head and you and you collect their venom

1052
01:18:36.22 --> 01:18:39.74
And you can use snakes to do things like kill rats

1053
01:18:40.46 --> 01:18:44.54
Right snakes can be used for some kind of good at some point

1054
01:18:45.90 --> 01:18:50.30
Now I know it's hard right I know it's hard and

1055
01:18:53.34 --> 01:18:55.34
Is it being fake

1056
01:18:56.54 --> 01:18:59.66
It may be it is maybe that is being fake

1057
01:18:59.66 --> 01:19:09.10
But you're doing it for the good of the team so again. It's not for personal game. That's a huge difference and also if you think about this idea of being fake

1058
01:19:11.58 --> 01:19:17.10
If you would be nice to people to help the team win then isn't that actually you?

1059
01:19:17.82 --> 01:19:24.14
Right so how can you be fake by being you right if my if what I do is hey

1060
01:19:24.14 --> 01:19:28.14
I help people and I get in their head and I'll all be nice to them so we can win

1061
01:19:28.14 --> 01:19:33.66
Hmm if I do that that's me that's not being fake. That's actually what I do. That's not being fake so

1062
01:19:35.26 --> 01:19:37.26
I think regardless in the end

1063
01:19:37.26 --> 01:19:39.98
It is something you have to do you do have to play the game

1064
01:19:40.62 --> 01:19:41.90
Um

1065
01:19:41.90 --> 01:19:47.10
And that is how you're gonna help your team win and it's also if you want to get those snakes

1066
01:19:48.70 --> 01:19:52.30
To come over to the light and get away from the darkness

1067
01:19:53.34 --> 01:19:57.98
You're not gonna do it by trying to kill them all you're gonna do is offend them and they're gonna attack you like I

1068
01:19:57.98 --> 01:20:02.54
Said if you show them a good example if you're productive and when you get all that stuff done

1069
01:20:02.54 --> 01:20:06.94
And you accomplish your mission and what you do is you say hey, it wasn't me to accomplish the mission

1070
01:20:06.94 --> 01:20:08.94
It was the snakes they did it

1071
01:20:08.94 --> 01:20:12.30
You know what those snakes start to stand upright they start to

1072
01:20:12.86 --> 01:20:18.02
Defang themselves and they start to realize that maybe they can do some good out there too

1073
01:20:19.74 --> 01:20:22.54
I like the snake analogy. Hey, he started it

1074
01:20:22.54 --> 01:20:24.54
Yeah

1075
01:20:27.66 --> 01:20:29.66
That oh

1076
01:20:29.66 --> 01:20:31.66
commentary like

1077
01:20:32.06 --> 01:20:36.46
No, no, no, no, no way you say and you know how you slowly build that relationship

1078
01:20:36.46 --> 01:20:39.90
Whatever that parts hard because it takes like time it takes time

1079
01:20:39.90 --> 01:20:42.54
It's been more harder than time is it takes the stomach?

1080
01:20:42.54 --> 01:20:47.58
Yeah, yeah, because you you got the guy that you know is a slimy guy that's just looking out for themselves

1081
01:20:47.58 --> 01:20:53.98
You got a man what's going on. Hey Bill what's happening? Yeah good to see you hey. Yeah, no good. Yeah

1082
01:20:55.18 --> 01:21:00.86
God a great weekend. Thank you. Yeah, how was your weekend? Yeah, you know so you're in that mode and you got to gut through that

1083
01:21:01.42 --> 01:21:03.42
Because you know you're a good person right

1084
01:21:04.46 --> 01:21:05.74
I think

1085
01:21:05.74 --> 01:21:11.90
Right, I think yeah, especially passive aggressive like that can be tough because a lot of times it's way easier

1086
01:21:11.90 --> 01:21:17.98
If I like if I if I launch a confrontation against you, it's way easier mentally to be like okay

1087
01:21:17.98 --> 01:21:19.34
We're in a little better enough

1088
01:21:19.66 --> 01:21:23.18
But if I just do like one little big and then kind of walk away or something like that

1089
01:21:23.90 --> 01:21:28.54
That can be way more like trying on your mind on your patience

1090
01:21:28.54 --> 01:21:33.70
So and then when you when you battle through that right or the idea of I got to battle through this

1091
01:21:33.70 --> 01:21:36.38
Okay, this would be hard just mentally whatever

1092
01:21:36.38 --> 01:21:40.38
I got to battle through that oh, I guess what you got to do that for a long time

1093
01:21:40.38 --> 01:21:45.66
That one time that that you think that was hard. All right. Well you got to keep on even a continual

1094
01:21:45.82 --> 01:21:47.34
Seating ever leave yeah

1095
01:21:47.34 --> 01:21:52.86
That's how makes open when we're gonna admit does make a challenging but I think if you just know this if you know if you can see the light

1096
01:21:52.86 --> 01:21:57.18
You know what you can do too and I hate to use this word because it seems to be a trendy word right now

1097
01:21:57.18 --> 01:22:01.10
You got to gamify it a little bit you know when somebody does something passive aggressive to me

1098
01:22:01.10 --> 01:22:07.14
I'm a oh score. I'm gonna have fun with this. Hey, you're right. That was a really good job that your team did over there

1099
01:22:07.14 --> 01:22:11.02
You know where they say saw the little dig at me. Yeah, I think you guys did fantastic

1100
01:22:11.02 --> 01:22:15.90
I didn't foresee that at all. Yeah, you're you're crushing it just I say oh

1101
01:22:15.90 --> 01:22:20.10
Oh that hurt I guess what I'm gonna win the long run. I just want a little battle against you

1102
01:22:20.10 --> 01:22:24.58
Yeah, and go come let these little things bot. Don't let the little things bother you

1103
01:22:25.14 --> 01:22:26.86
Man think about the big stuff

1104
01:22:26.86 --> 01:22:28.50
You get big stuff to worry about out there

1105
01:22:28.50 --> 01:22:33.54
You can't let the little things bother you and are you on the right path if you're trying to do the right thing for the right reason

1106
01:22:33.54 --> 01:22:38.30
It's all good doesn't matter what else is going on. I'm good with it and that's what I mean

1107
01:22:38.30 --> 01:22:42.62
But kind of the light at the end of the tunnel like you know like you know that's where I'm going

1108
01:22:42.62 --> 01:22:45.58
This is just part of the thing. You know, I see the whole path

1109
01:22:45.58 --> 01:22:49.02
Yes, and it just makes it easier when you kind of know that but

1110
01:22:50.34 --> 01:22:51.86
When you're at that time

1111
01:22:51.86 --> 01:22:57.14
Fasten we're gonna do the worst man the kind of where I see see you talk about basketball recipe the worst

1112
01:22:57.14 --> 01:23:00.80
I don't this is not like this thing that bothers me. Yeah

1113
01:23:00.80 --> 01:23:05.48
I don't know it doesn't it's never been a big issue for me when somebody's past progress with me

1114
01:23:05.48 --> 01:23:10.36
I just okay cool. I see the game. We're in. I'm gonna play. Yeah, I'll play that game. I'll play that game. I'll play that man

1115
01:23:10.36 --> 01:23:14.44
See if you can just look at it like that and look at it like that. Yeah, man. It make it

1116
01:23:15.20 --> 01:23:19.84
It would almost make it the opposite situation like it. I almost be glad it does because I don't

1117
01:23:20.40 --> 01:23:24.52
I've never had a big issue with some guy that's being passed. I never had that. Yeah. Oh

1118
01:23:24.52 --> 01:23:30.36
I see it's a little shot right there. You know I'm throw some credit at them. I'm gonna flank them. Yeah, they're gonna be good

1119
01:23:30.68 --> 01:23:35.72
Not worried about that person that person's not really secure in the first place and they're sort of one of these

1120
01:23:35.88 --> 01:23:40.48
Sly me snakes, right? That are trying to make things happen. That's okay. I'll just just help them help them out

1121
01:23:40.48 --> 01:23:44.32
You know what you're trying to be passable. Grasmal, but bring you out in the open bring out the clear

1122
01:23:44.32 --> 01:23:48.04
Not enough. I'm not an offensive way, but you know what? I think you're right about that

1123
01:23:48.04 --> 01:23:51.72
You know, I think you could do a better job here. Come on and help my team or whatever

1124
01:23:51.72 --> 01:23:58.04
Yeah, because when they're doing that, what are they attacking? You're attacking. You're ego

1125
01:23:58.04 --> 01:24:03.92
So if you just get over that thing and just say you know what? No big deal. Yeah, that's good

1126
01:24:03.92 --> 01:24:07.56
I see what's going on here. Let's bring it out in the open. Yeah, bring out the open

1127
01:24:07.56 --> 01:24:15.28
Expose the ambush and just say hey buddy. Yeah. Oh, yeah, we're good. Let's let's move forward together as a team. How's that sound? I'm down

1128
01:24:15.28 --> 01:24:17.28
Now

1129
01:24:19.28 --> 01:24:21.28
I can 10 worth the

1130
01:24:21.28 --> 01:24:31.60
You know what and I'm thinking about this. I'm like, yeah, that sounds so easy, but you know I realize it's one like I care about the person and they'd be passive aggressive like or if I care about like their opinion

1131
01:24:31.60 --> 01:24:33.60
I say that you had to offend them

1132
01:24:33.60 --> 01:24:37.44
No, no, no, no, it's not not in that way. Not in the way where like I might offend them, but

1133
01:24:39.36 --> 01:24:44.16
Like if like you care about what they think, you know, okay, and they're like what's wrong with that?

1134
01:24:44.16 --> 01:24:49.68
I guess nothing but I guess maybe that's where my sensitivity to it is I mean coal workers

1135
01:24:50.64 --> 01:24:54.08
Maybe an haven't had coworkers in a long time. Well, I guess you're a coworker, but

1136
01:24:54.96 --> 01:24:59.76
You're not passive aggressive, but nonetheless, I should say you're more aggressive not

1137
01:25:01.68 --> 01:25:08.32
Maybe it would be in a situate like maybe a coal worker situation would be the kind of situation that I'm like thinking about

1138
01:25:08.32 --> 01:25:12.80
Where people would be more sensitive than it's you know what actually the other day you and I had a conversation

1139
01:25:12.80 --> 01:25:18.88
You might have been being passive aggressive. No, maybe you we were we're trying to do something and you said hey, you know

1140
01:25:18.88 --> 01:25:22.88
I'm just not sure if this is like really something we should do and I was like cool. Don't do it

1141
01:25:24.88 --> 01:25:28.000
Okay, that was in passive passive aggressive. That was like

1142
01:25:28.56 --> 01:25:33.68
It was different is like trading lightly. You know, okay. You know like you wasn't necessarily tri-strait dope

1143
01:25:34.56 --> 01:25:37.28
You gave me a little bit of an indication of I

1144
01:25:37.28 --> 01:25:43.12
Undersea I said oh there's something going on some kind of ambush here. I said okay come on out. We're good. Let's bring it out. No, but because I'm good

1145
01:25:43.68 --> 01:25:50.40
It's not that it's like you know I respect your opinion. Let's go with it. No factor make that happen. That was good. How I roll

1146
01:25:53.36 --> 01:26:00.08
Yeah, the passive aggressive is the kind where like you know if I'm mad at you for something and then

1147
01:26:00.72 --> 01:26:02.72
I'm like nope all good

1148
01:26:02.72 --> 01:26:06.40
But meanwhile my body language is saying yeah, it's like that kind of that even passive

1149
01:26:06.40 --> 01:26:10.08
Yes, that is what passive aggressive is it's like it's like like oh

1150
01:26:10.72 --> 01:26:15.52
It's all good, but then like little digs they're indicating other stuff. It's like this

1151
01:26:15.52 --> 01:26:22.24
Everything it's yeah super wack. Yeah, like I said when I went someone's being that wouldn't be the I'm gonna bring them all the way

1152
01:26:22.24 --> 01:26:27.92
Yeah, I'm gonna bring it from passive to just straight aggressive so that we can get through it because I'm not going to get

1153
01:26:27.92 --> 01:26:29.92
This is the thing if we're on a team

1154
01:26:30.08 --> 01:26:32.08
Why are we going against each other?

1155
01:26:32.08 --> 01:26:35.44
What's probably at the root there is just ego situation?

1156
01:26:35.44 --> 01:26:37.84
Yeah, you can put that to rest. You're good

1157
01:26:39.20 --> 01:26:43.44
Hard though hard to put that ego in check for all of us. Yeah, yeah, man

1158
01:26:44.56 --> 01:26:50.40
I mean coworkers are the your peers so you know it's natural to kind of care what they think even if you don't like them

1159
01:26:50.80 --> 01:26:55.84
You know, it's just I think it's just natural. Yeah, of course people want to do a good job and

1160
01:26:56.72 --> 01:26:58.08
And

1161
01:26:58.08 --> 01:27:01.04
Want other people to think that they're doing a good job. Yeah, another wrong with that

1162
01:27:01.04 --> 01:27:05.36
So when they start throwing jobs. It's okay. You know what why are they throwing a job?

1163
01:27:05.36 --> 01:27:09.12
Maybe you're not doing this good of jobs. You thought you were and now taking a little shot to your ego

1164
01:27:09.12 --> 01:27:11.76
So let's address it. Let's figure out what the issue is you know

1165
01:27:13.76 --> 01:27:18.32
This is like you get to yeah, I done this move I've seen this move before

1166
01:27:20.80 --> 01:27:22.80
Rock roll

1167
01:27:23.36 --> 01:27:25.36
Next question

1168
01:27:26.16 --> 01:27:27.84
What is

1169
01:27:27.84 --> 01:27:34.64
The best case you've ever heard against extreme ownership and what's your response or alternatively

1170
01:27:35.84 --> 01:27:38.40
Are there situations where extreme ownership is the wrong answer?

1171
01:27:41.12 --> 01:27:43.12
If you've never heard an argument against

1172
01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.000
Let me propose to

1173
01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:52.000
Okay, one extreme ownership focuses too much on achieving victory through focus on strategy and tactics

1174
01:27:52.56 --> 01:27:55.92
Before you even go there. I got asked that question at the master

1175
01:27:55.92 --> 01:28:00.08
Is there such a thing as too much extreme ownership and

1176
01:28:01.44 --> 01:28:08.000
I said well, yes, there is actually such a thing as too much extreme ownership for instance

1177
01:28:09.68 --> 01:28:11.68
And I actually broke it down to

1178
01:28:12.40 --> 01:28:15.60
The fact that there's two types of extreme ownership

1179
01:28:16.48 --> 01:28:19.12
That you're gonna have internal and external

1180
01:28:19.12 --> 01:28:25.12
Internal is I own everything and I know that but I'm not sitting here telling everyone right

1181
01:28:25.84 --> 01:28:30.16
External is hey guys. I'm gonna own this this is me. This is mine

1182
01:28:30.56 --> 01:28:33.04
So you can easily see from there

1183
01:28:33.60 --> 01:28:38.08
Where you can overplay your hand of external extreme ownership for instance

1184
01:28:38.88 --> 01:28:41.92
Echo you're in charge of this project that we're doing

1185
01:28:43.20 --> 01:28:47.68
I want you to do it like this because I own it like like that's obviously wrong

1186
01:28:47.68 --> 01:28:53.44
Right, so if I'm trying to get people to do things like from trying to use decentralized command and all I'm telling everyone

1187
01:28:53.44 --> 01:28:56.64
It's like this is my project I own it echo you do this

1188
01:28:56.88 --> 01:29:01.68
This is your part of the project but the project is mine right does that make does that motivate you in any way?

1189
01:29:02.48 --> 01:29:06.88
Okay, so we're not gonna do that that would be too much extreme ownership. It would be too much

1190
01:29:07.52 --> 01:29:09.68
Outward extreme ownership now

1191
01:29:10.80 --> 01:29:12.96
If so what I want to do is I want to say echo

1192
01:29:12.96 --> 01:29:19.36
Do this is your project. I'm gonna sit back let you run this thing. I think you've got a really good idea and vision on how this is gonna work

1193
01:29:19.36 --> 01:29:25.52
And I think you could actually do a better job than I can do so here's here's the goal that we're trying to accomplish and if you just

1194
01:29:25.52 --> 01:29:29.92
You know come up with a plan and tell me how you're gonna execute it. I'm standing by right now

1195
01:29:29.92 --> 01:29:33.44
You're like oh, jockels trust me. You can do this. That's pretty cool. Right. Yeah, that's awesome

1196
01:29:33.76 --> 01:29:35.76
So now we have a good thing going

1197
01:29:35.76 --> 01:29:38.48
So that's that's what I'm gonna keep my ownership internal

1198
01:29:39.04 --> 01:29:42.08
I'm not gonna project it on you to keep it internal

1199
01:29:42.08 --> 01:29:51.12
Now where this flips is the project fails and clearly the example now becomes crystal clear because now if I use

1200
01:29:51.84 --> 01:29:59.68
External ownership and I'm saying I should use external ownership and when the boss says hey jocco your team failed on this mission

1201
01:29:59.92 --> 01:30:01.52
I'll say you know what we did

1202
01:30:01.52 --> 01:30:05.28
I made some mistakes here here's what I did wrong here's we made the wrong investments

1203
01:30:05.28 --> 01:30:09.52
I didn't allocate resources well here my fault we're gonna get it fixed next time around won't happen

1204
01:30:09.52 --> 01:30:17.20
Hmm, okay, that's cool. That's I'm now correctly using excessive extreme ownership to take ownership of the project that you actually screwed up

1205
01:30:18.72 --> 01:30:24.88
Now obviously the wrong thing would be hey jockel this project fail and I say oh

1206
01:30:24.88 --> 01:30:29.36
That's because echo drop the ball on this he didn't get this done in time and echo's got issues over here

1207
01:30:29.92 --> 01:30:34.48
Now that's not good. I want to take I don't want to use that. I'm keeping my ownership internal

1208
01:30:34.56 --> 01:30:36.08
I'm being lame basically

1209
01:30:36.08 --> 01:30:47.52
So yes, the the argument against extreme ownership is yes if you take too much ownership of a project and you're not letting you're not using enough decentralized command

1210
01:30:47.52 --> 01:30:52.88
That's why there's a dichotomy between those two there's a dichotomy between extreme ownership and decentralized command

1211
01:30:52.88 --> 01:30:54.48
And if I use too much

1212
01:30:54.48 --> 01:30:58.000
Extreme ownership when I'm trying to execute decentralized command, it's not gonna work right

1213
01:30:58.56 --> 01:31:03.52
Now once I'm a state happens or there's failure that's when you step in and take ownership and by the way

1214
01:31:03.52 --> 01:31:06.72
You should have taken ownership all along to make sure that the project didn't fail but

1215
01:31:07.28 --> 01:31:11.60
These things happen you don't win every single time don't care who you are now

1216
01:31:12.56 --> 01:31:19.12
He gave except a couple examples. I'll let you proceed with the question good sir. Okay, he's gonna propose to example

1217
01:31:20.48 --> 01:31:24.72
Okay extreme ownership focuses is too much on achieving victory through focus on strategy

1218
01:31:24.96 --> 01:31:27.92
in tactics but not assessing whether war was

1219
01:31:28.88 --> 01:31:30.88
worth fighting in the first place

1220
01:31:30.88 --> 01:31:38.56
For example, maybe prior to prioritizing execute and covering move and institute decentralized command

1221
01:31:38.88 --> 01:31:42.64
To become the leading buggy whip manufacturer in the country

1222
01:31:43.92 --> 01:31:50.48
Right before Henry Ford releases the model T or maybe you built the Titus sharp is most aggressive sales team in history

1223
01:31:50.80 --> 01:31:56.000
But the product they're selling is praying on the weakness of poor or ignorant. Okay, so

1224
01:31:56.000 --> 01:32:01.04
This is fairly simple and in the bug extreme ownership

1225
01:32:01.60 --> 01:32:03.60
I believe chapter three is called belief

1226
01:32:04.80 --> 01:32:11.36
That is you kind of believe in what you're doing and part of believing in what you're doing is understand why you were doing and what you're doing and how it is

1227
01:32:11.60 --> 01:32:13.60
Beneficial in the world

1228
01:32:13.76 --> 01:32:19.28
Right so for instance, both these examples would fail the test of believing in what you're doing

1229
01:32:19.28 --> 01:32:25.76
They would fail the test anyone that was in the transportation industry at the turn of the century and

1230
01:32:26.64 --> 01:32:30.08
Would understand that the buggy the horse and buggy was doomed

1231
01:32:30.72 --> 01:32:36.08
When they started seeing reliable cars come out on the streets and somebody that truly

1232
01:32:36.40 --> 01:32:40.24
Exercise extreme ownership would step up would adapt

1233
01:32:40.88 --> 01:32:45.12
Which is another key concept of extreme ownership and lead the transition from

1234
01:32:45.12 --> 01:32:52.24
Buggy whips to this new technology of cars so it's okay. It's not you're gonna step up

1235
01:32:52.24 --> 01:32:54.96
You got to make changes that's part of ownership is looking and assessing

1236
01:32:56.24 --> 01:32:59.52
The other example where you're leading

1237
01:33:01.28 --> 01:33:07.04
Extreme ownership you're leading something that is praying on weak people well then

1238
01:33:07.76 --> 01:33:11.36
That doesn't pass the test right that doesn't pass the test and believing what you're doing because if I'm like hey

1239
01:33:11.36 --> 01:33:14.24
You know what I'm gonna get out there do I'm gonna get out there and pray on extreme people

1240
01:33:14.24 --> 01:33:19.04
Yes, you know that's what we do now of course if you have a person that's a sociopath or

1241
01:33:19.28 --> 01:33:26.64
Doesn't care about others is only out for themselves and they exercise extreme ownership in order to accomplish an evil mission

1242
01:33:28.32 --> 01:33:35.44
Well, yeah, that's gonna be bad because people that people that take ownership of things can make things happen and if they're

1243
01:33:35.44 --> 01:33:39.60
Caused as evil then that's going to be bad. It's gonna be a bad situation

1244
01:33:40.88 --> 01:33:42.88
so

1245
01:33:42.88 --> 01:33:50.48
You know the the thing that's inherent in extreme ownership is a true understanding of the mission and belief of the mission

1246
01:33:51.04 --> 01:33:54.72
And the knowledge that you're doing the right things for the right reasons

1247
01:33:55.36 --> 01:33:59.36
Which is why these two examples are are actually non issues and

1248
01:34:01.44 --> 01:34:05.20
Then he gave another example. What's the example number two? Yeah, number two is

1249
01:34:05.20 --> 01:34:13.44
The time and focus commitments required to practice extreme ownership come at too high a cost to your family

1250
01:34:14.40 --> 01:34:21.12
We didn't sign up for this for you know didn't sign up for mission and in the end the gratification of having achieved

1251
01:34:21.12 --> 01:34:26.80
Your objective won't be worth what you've given up in your personal life perhaps substantial ownership

1252
01:34:27.52 --> 01:34:30.16
I don't know what is a better fit for most people

1253
01:34:30.16 --> 01:34:35.04
Okay, well, let's just not forget

1254
01:34:35.92 --> 01:34:37.92
That extreme ownership is not

1255
01:34:38.80 --> 01:34:40.80
Just about business

1256
01:34:40.80 --> 01:34:43.28
in any stretch. It's about life

1257
01:34:44.80 --> 01:34:46.80
And you have to own the outcome

1258
01:34:47.84 --> 01:34:49.84
in life and that

1259
01:34:49.84 --> 01:34:52.72
inherently includes balancing between

1260
01:34:53.52 --> 01:34:59.04
What you do for business and what you do with your family now? I'll tell you that we hear all the time

1261
01:34:59.04 --> 01:35:02.32
About how extreme ownership actually saved

1262
01:35:03.28 --> 01:35:04.56
Marriages

1263
01:35:04.56 --> 01:35:13.36
Not hurt some but saves them and you know the husband will stop blaming his wife or vice versa and look at themselves and see where they can improve instead of blaming your wife

1264
01:35:13.36 --> 01:35:16.64
For what's going wrong? You say oh, maybe it's not cool that I do this

1265
01:35:17.20 --> 01:35:24.40
particular thing that I know a noise or right take some ownership of that they take ownership of the relationship and the problems in the relationship and

1266
01:35:24.40 --> 01:35:27.44
They fix them instead of making excuses or passing the blame

1267
01:35:27.44 --> 01:35:31.12
So extreme ownership is going to help that family

1268
01:35:31.92 --> 01:35:39.28
Then if you listen to the the podcast with JP which AP to now on it which is number 46 JP is taking ownership of his marriage

1269
01:35:39.28 --> 01:35:42.08
Which and actually were divorced at the time and

1270
01:35:42.72 --> 01:35:50.24
Applied the simple laws of combat right simplify cover move and and got his marriage back on track and

1271
01:35:50.24 --> 01:35:55.28
So so extreme ownership is not

1272
01:35:56.24 --> 01:35:58.56
100% focused on business it's focused on life

1273
01:36:01.44 --> 01:36:06.56
And the dichotomy is also there that I talk about all the time that you have to balance all the opposing forces

1274
01:36:06.64 --> 01:36:12.16
It's a chapter in the book called the dichotomy of leadership right you got a balance these opposing forces in your world now

1275
01:36:12.96 --> 01:36:18.000
One of those opposing forces is balancing the the pull of your family with the pull of your work

1276
01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:20.000
and

1277
01:36:22.24 --> 01:36:30.16
Yeah, you can go too far in one direction you can go so far in one direction that you lose you you can go so work so hard and do such long hours that you lose your dead dead

1278
01:36:30.16 --> 01:36:31.52
Then you lose your family

1279
01:36:31.52 --> 01:36:37.36
You can also do the opposite where you don't do enough for at work and you focus so much in your family that you lose your job

1280
01:36:37.52 --> 01:36:39.52
Which one of those is a good outcome?

1281
01:36:40.16 --> 01:36:43.56
Neither that's why you have to balance neither one of those is a good outcome

1282
01:36:43.56 --> 01:36:46.92
Yeah, that's why you have to balance and by the way

1283
01:36:48.04 --> 01:36:53.000
It's one of those things to I've seen this happen with you know friends of mine that have gone out sort of a breakdown

1284
01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:56.84
Kind of downward spiral in their life. I think this is problematic

1285
01:36:57.32 --> 01:37:00.12
People start having trouble with their marriage right and

1286
01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:03.000
They quit their job

1287
01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:10.60
And they think oh now will be able to spend more time, but now it was a minute or no many money and it turns into a disaster and I always say look man

1288
01:37:10.60 --> 01:37:16.12
Think about this your job is what how you provide for your family

1289
01:37:16.28 --> 01:37:19.80
So let's have a plan before we move in this direction

1290
01:37:20.36 --> 01:37:23.80
Did you got a balance if you if you because if you throw everything

1291
01:37:24.68 --> 01:37:30.52
Like I just said if you say okay my job is you know, I'm too stressed out and I'm just gonna leave my job and just focus on my family

1292
01:37:30.52 --> 01:37:34.92
Now you've got no income you got a whole new level stresses coming out your because he's gonna put the food on the table

1293
01:37:36.28 --> 01:37:38.28
So like one guys

1294
01:37:38.28 --> 01:37:42.96
They stop working out after they get married because oh I got to focus on my family my kids, you know

1295
01:37:42.96 --> 01:37:47.12
And stuff around but health down you know health down energy down

1296
01:37:47.12 --> 01:37:52.48
Yeah, you know you become a low energy father. We don't want that that's bad for everybody that's bad for the whole family

1297
01:37:52.48 --> 01:37:56.76
So yeah, that's another thing if you got if you've got your your

1298
01:37:57.72 --> 01:38:02.24
wife or your husband is saying hey, you know you're working out all the time

1299
01:38:02.24 --> 01:38:08.32
You know, I don't like this say hey, here's the benefits. You know, do you want me to be around for an extended period of time?

1300
01:38:08.32 --> 01:38:11.32
You want me to be alive past 60 do you want me to be a healthy?

1301
01:38:11.44 --> 01:38:15.40
Do you want me to be able to defend our family should there be some kind of an encounter?

1302
01:38:15.40 --> 01:38:18.68
You know, I know I do want to be able to defend this family

1303
01:38:18.84 --> 01:38:21.60
So yeah, I got to spend a little extra time on their gun range

1304
01:38:21.60 --> 01:38:27.44
Yeah, I got to spend a little extra time on the GT mat. Yes, I'm gonna work out. That's I'm doing that you think I'm doing it for me

1305
01:38:27.44 --> 01:38:34.20
Do it for us for us. Yeah, I'm doing it for us now. Of course got a balance out too cuz you can go overboard there, too

1306
01:38:34.40 --> 01:38:41.000
Yeah, working out. Yeah, it's working out. Be careful. Like working out is not to be confused with going to the gym

1307
01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:46.08
So like there's some people is a huge separation there. Yeah, so yeah guys will like go to the gym

1308
01:38:46.08 --> 01:38:49.76
Or even the jutsu mat because this face it there is a big element of social

1309
01:38:50.08 --> 01:38:52.60
There, you know that social component and jutsu

1310
01:38:52.60 --> 01:38:57.24
What do you mean when you go to jutsu like you there's a lot of paying it out?

1311
01:38:57.96 --> 01:39:02.16
You mean talking to like talking to other people yeah, you get friends. You know, of course

1312
01:39:02.76 --> 01:39:07.72
So some people will be like hey, I'll go to jutsu mean while new baby whatever

1313
01:39:08.52 --> 01:39:12.48
Hey, I'm gonna do jutsu, but then they'll roll for the hour hour and a half and then

1314
01:39:13.32 --> 01:39:15.64
3 and a half four hours later they'll come home

1315
01:39:15.64 --> 01:39:20.80
They also do jutsu all the here's the benefits. I'm like yeah, you did the jutsu for hour and a half

1316
01:39:20.80 --> 01:39:25.24
The other what however long you were cruising with your friends in the lounge drinking outside

1317
01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:33.06
Yeah, don't do that don't confuse it is don't have balance or use it. You know, I'll be we'll use it like I got a go, but you know

1318
01:39:33.96 --> 01:39:38.52
Yeah, that's good and you know these questions what I liked about him is he's saying hey, you know

1319
01:39:38.80 --> 01:39:45.88
Basically put the extreme ownership attitude into the UFC cage and let's see how it does and these problem examples

1320
01:39:45.88 --> 01:39:52.44
So I think I think it does all right. We're just get your home gym. You know

1321
01:39:52.84 --> 01:39:54.84
Yeah, definitely recommend the home gym

1322
01:39:57.60 --> 01:40:00.08
Jockel do you follow stoicism

1323
01:40:01.24 --> 01:40:05.64
Did Zen practice lead to your thoughts about detachment and ego?

1324
01:40:09.16 --> 01:40:13.84
So I get asked these questions the other day on Twitter and as you know when I'm answering Twitter

1325
01:40:13.84 --> 01:40:18.60
I'm doing pretty thirst answers because I'm answering a lot of different questions

1326
01:40:18.60 --> 01:40:20.36
One verse short word

1327
01:40:20.52 --> 01:40:21.52
so

1328
01:40:21.52 --> 01:40:22.88
This one I

1329
01:40:22.88 --> 01:40:27.96
Particularly remember that answer someone's a do you follow stoicism and I just wrote back no

1330
01:40:29.04 --> 01:40:37.60
You know don't and in a while later I get you know the thread back and the guy come back and said something along the lines of like

1331
01:40:37.60 --> 01:40:38.40
You know

1332
01:40:38.40 --> 01:40:44.68
I don't know what it is you don't agree with with stoicism. It's very similar to what you believe or something like that. It wasn't being a jerk

1333
01:40:44.68 --> 01:40:48.92
You're just like you know, you know what's wrong with you. I don't you practice stoicism and

1334
01:40:51.32 --> 01:40:53.32
Here's the deal

1335
01:40:53.32 --> 01:40:55.32
And I love to

1336
01:40:55.88 --> 01:41:00.44
Come back here and tell people how learned I am

1337
01:41:01.44 --> 01:41:07.88
Then how well read I am about the philosophies and the ancient cultures and the Eastern religions

1338
01:41:07.88 --> 01:41:10.88
and all matters in the world philosophical

1339
01:41:13.24 --> 01:41:20.12
But the fact is I'm not I'm not and actually when I was a kid

1340
01:41:20.12 --> 01:41:26.24
And by the way kid for me lasts a long time. I mean kid for me goes pretty recent

1341
01:41:26.24 --> 01:41:30.40
You know, I made six months ago. I kind of consider myself a kid. But when I was a kid

1342
01:41:31.40 --> 01:41:33.40
the teachings of

1343
01:41:33.92 --> 01:41:36.80
Philosophers and of the ancients those

1344
01:41:36.80 --> 01:41:38.80
That information was transmitted

1345
01:41:40.60 --> 01:41:47.76
by academics right by teachers or by professors professors and to be blunt

1346
01:41:49.52 --> 01:41:51.52
And Frank when I was a kid

1347
01:41:52.32 --> 01:41:54.32
There was a lot of

1348
01:41:54.32 --> 01:41:59.84
People in that realm and the academic realm that didn't exactly command my respect now

1349
01:42:00.32 --> 01:42:04.48
They were people that went to college. I wanted to learn from people that went to war

1350
01:42:04.48 --> 01:42:09.12
That's what I wanted hmm now the part that I missed

1351
01:42:10.72 --> 01:42:17.20
Was that many of the ancients were warriors and their teachings were important and

1352
01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:21.48
Through my own arrogance looking at these professors and these teachers

1353
01:42:21.48 --> 01:42:25.56
I don't know can you learn anything from that person? I'm gonna go in the military

1354
01:42:26.48 --> 01:42:30.48
I'm gonna learn from a gun resargent Marine Corps. That's what I was thinking

1355
01:42:30.48 --> 01:42:41.32
But the fact is the reading and the studying and the schooling did not really lead me to any of my

1356
01:42:42.60 --> 01:42:44.60
beliefs or values

1357
01:42:46.92 --> 01:42:54.92
It was life that did it was it was the things I experienced that brought me to this place where I am right now

1358
01:42:54.92 --> 01:42:56.92
not the books that I read

1359
01:42:56.92 --> 01:43:04.28
Not the classes that I attended and like I said of course part of this a big part of this was just my own

1360
01:43:05.20 --> 01:43:09.18
ignorance and ego me saying what can these professors teach me?

1361
01:43:10.68 --> 01:43:14.84
And that's why I footnote right now caveat or

1362
01:43:17.20 --> 01:43:21.36
Secondary thought everyone out there when you have the opportunity to learn

1363
01:43:21.36 --> 01:43:28.08
It's take full advantage of it and I know now again. I know now

1364
01:43:28.72 --> 01:43:30.72
That you can learn from anybody

1365
01:43:31.44 --> 01:43:37.24
You can learn from anybody everybody's got something to teach you so open up your mind and

1366
01:43:39.92 --> 01:43:46.28
That being said since I was too stupid and arrogant to learn oftentimes to learn from books and teachers

1367
01:43:46.28 --> 01:43:48.28
I had to learn from life

1368
01:43:48.28 --> 01:43:53.20
And as I look now, yeah, I see similarities between

1369
01:43:54.76 --> 01:44:01.36
Again, I'll use the word beliefs, but I think that's a strong word, but I see similarities between what I think and

1370
01:44:03.56 --> 01:44:05.56
the other

1371
01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:09.98
Philosophical thoughts throughout the ages and I think that's

1372
01:44:10.64 --> 01:44:15.52
Parts I think that's actually not even partially. I think that's because there are really are some universal truths

1373
01:44:15.52 --> 01:44:21.76
For humanity and for people and I think that if you

1374
01:44:22.64 --> 01:44:24.64
Walk the path of life and

1375
01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:29.28
You pay attention to what's happening around you and

1376
01:44:30.88 --> 01:44:32.88
you're exposed

1377
01:44:33.44 --> 01:44:35.44
to

1378
01:44:36.52 --> 01:44:43.12
Joy and your exposed to suffering and your exposed to love and to hate and to war and to peace

1379
01:44:43.12 --> 01:44:45.84
I think if you have led

1380
01:44:47.48 --> 01:44:50.72
Down that path and you have followed down that path

1381
01:44:50.72 --> 01:44:54.96
I think that all the paths

1382
01:44:56.44 --> 01:44:59.28
But they kind of arrive at some place that's

1383
01:45:00.36 --> 01:45:02.36
fairly similar

1384
01:45:03.64 --> 01:45:08.48
In the term that they kind of use is this this term of enlightenment and again

1385
01:45:08.48 --> 01:45:12.68
I think that's definitely too strong for word for what I'm trying to say

1386
01:45:12.68 --> 01:45:16.52
But that's sort of a a broad term that captures it

1387
01:45:17.32 --> 01:45:19.32
But I think these paths

1388
01:45:19.96 --> 01:45:23.96
They all lead to a similar form of

1389
01:45:25.64 --> 01:45:27.64
Enlightenment

1390
01:45:28.04 --> 01:45:34.96
And I don't think it really matters what terrain you went through or what specific path you took

1391
01:45:36.84 --> 01:45:42.46
I think that we see that the path looks very similar and it says the same things

1392
01:45:42.46 --> 01:45:46.14
When you get to the end it says to be disciplined. It says to keep your ego in check

1393
01:45:46.46 --> 01:45:54.18
It says to keep things simple and work hard and tell the truth and believe in what you say and what you do and treat other people with respect

1394
01:45:54.94 --> 01:45:56.38
And

1395
01:45:56.38 --> 01:46:00.46
When you start getting overwhelmed with emotions you got to detach from those and

1396
01:46:01.42 --> 01:46:04.62
I think that there's things like those that are just

1397
01:46:05.58 --> 01:46:06.62
Universal

1398
01:46:06.62 --> 01:46:09.90
Truths and I think you can find them in what the Buddha said

1399
01:46:09.90 --> 01:46:16.62
Or what Marcus are really a center what the Bible says or what any number of

1400
01:46:17.82 --> 01:46:19.82
Religious or philosophical teachers

1401
01:46:21.42 --> 01:46:27.50
I think they're all pretty similar and I think you can learn them from those ancients

1402
01:46:29.26 --> 01:46:31.26
Or I think you can find them yourself

1403
01:46:33.66 --> 01:46:34.54
And

1404
01:46:34.54 --> 01:46:40.86
Unless you're of course two stubborn and arrogant to listen here the lessons of the past but

1405
01:46:42.06 --> 01:46:44.06
If you're not

1406
01:46:45.50 --> 01:46:50.54
I think you can get there and that's sort of how I arrived at

1407
01:46:51.66 --> 01:46:58.38
Again the this the word is too strong, but the way I think I'll put it to that way the way I think

1408
01:46:59.90 --> 01:47:01.90
It's

1409
01:47:01.90 --> 01:47:03.18
Where I ended up

1410
01:47:03.18 --> 01:47:05.18
And I didn't get too much

1411
01:47:06.30 --> 01:47:09.50
Direction along the way and now it's really obvious

1412
01:47:09.50 --> 01:47:12.38
I mean when you look at and I'm sure we'll do Marcus you're really at some point

1413
01:47:13.18 --> 01:47:15.18
You know because his

1414
01:47:15.66 --> 01:47:23.26
You know stoic saying are awesome and they totally match and I wish I would have I wish what I would have learned about Marcus

1415
01:47:23.26 --> 01:47:26.94
Aralia's and it's off more year and high school I said wow this guy's got it together

1416
01:47:26.94 --> 01:47:30.14
I'm gonna listen to him he was a warrior but I didn't do that

1417
01:47:30.14 --> 01:47:35.34
Why because the guy that was teaching me I'll say now with this guy doesn't know he's talking about it's got some teacher

1418
01:47:36.14 --> 01:47:41.18
Right, yeah, there's a reason they're called teacher so they can teach you but you got to be willing to listen and learn

1419
01:47:41.66 --> 01:47:43.42
So

1420
01:47:43.42 --> 01:47:48.22
You know I always try and I've talked about this when we talked about the the jockel academy, right having a school

1421
01:47:48.22 --> 01:47:53.58
I always talked about tying this thread between all this history in the world so you see that people

1422
01:47:53.58 --> 01:47:55.58
So the kids can understand

1423
01:47:55.74 --> 01:47:59.34
What it means and where it came from and I think that that's something that I

1424
01:47:59.34 --> 01:48:04.30
Never made those connections when I was a kid. I never made those connections in high school, you know

1425
01:48:04.30 --> 01:48:08.14
Even I was going to college I went to college. I was pretty old when I went to college for a college student

1426
01:48:08.14 --> 01:48:11.74
I think I was 27 right so also mature

1427
01:48:12.46 --> 01:48:14.94
Allegedly mature. I wasn't mature

1428
01:48:14.94 --> 01:48:17.42
You know, I was trying to do when I went to college get good grades

1429
01:48:17.98 --> 01:48:22.62
The teacher it was me against the teacher the the contest was great

1430
01:48:23.02 --> 01:48:27.26
I'm gonna beat you. I wasn't saying you know what this guy really has a lot to show me

1431
01:48:27.26 --> 01:48:31.18
This guy really got to learn a lot from this. I can apply this in my life. No, I wasn't saying that

1432
01:48:31.18 --> 01:48:34.46
I was too stupid. I was too arrogant to say that so what did I do?

1433
01:48:34.70 --> 01:48:40.14
Studied hard memorized what they told me to memorize that's what I did. I wasn't I was focused on the grade

1434
01:48:40.62 --> 01:48:42.14
Not on the

1435
01:48:42.14 --> 01:48:44.14
learning now. I'll tell you

1436
01:48:44.38 --> 01:48:46.78
That's not an excuse for oh

1437
01:48:46.78 --> 01:48:50.70
I'm not gonna worry about the grade. I'm just gonna learn no wrong answer

1438
01:48:50.70 --> 01:48:55.50
I'm saying this specifically for my kids that are probably listening to this and they'll say like well that you know

1439
01:48:55.50 --> 01:48:59.82
I'm focused on the learning negative you focus on the learning good. You still get your A

1440
01:49:00.38 --> 01:49:02.86
You get you win you still win

1441
01:49:03.98 --> 01:49:05.98
So that's

1442
01:49:05.98 --> 01:49:10.38
I guess you know again. I'm sorry and I think sometimes people get caught up in like

1443
01:49:11.10 --> 01:49:13.90
it's a you ever heard me say

1444
01:49:15.42 --> 01:49:17.42
Talk about

1445
01:49:17.42 --> 01:49:21.18
When when we got back from I got back from my first deployment to Iraq and

1446
01:49:21.18 --> 01:49:25.82
And we actually when I was into you bruiser with life we had a saying it was a joke

1447
01:49:26.22 --> 01:49:27.74
It was a wee weebe

1448
01:49:27.74 --> 01:49:30.46
Which stood for when I was in Baghdad

1449
01:49:31.18 --> 01:49:36.86
Right when I was in Baghdad because a lot of people now everyone had done one deployment to Baghdad and so any time

1450
01:49:36.86 --> 01:49:41.66
They were having any kind of a conversation. They'd say well when I was in Baghdad and we go we web

1451
01:49:41.66 --> 01:49:43.82
So you get some guy some instructor or some

1452
01:49:44.06 --> 01:49:48.30
Calderay from the training from the training attached me that would be like when I was in Baghdad

1453
01:49:48.30 --> 01:49:51.10
We did this every time and it also guys we weeb right?

1454
01:49:51.66 --> 01:49:56.78
Because it's a way of saying oh look to I this is this is confirmed in the past and therefore it's correct

1455
01:49:57.10 --> 01:50:01.42
Right and I was said man you can't say that you can't say we weeb right?

1456
01:50:01.42 --> 01:50:05.98
You can't say when I was in Baghdad you can't say this is the way this is I learned what you say

1457
01:50:05.98 --> 01:50:09.42
Should be able to stand on its own two feet that's my point so

1458
01:50:10.38 --> 01:50:12.38
I think a lot of times people

1459
01:50:12.38 --> 01:50:13.42
Say oh well

1460
01:50:13.42 --> 01:50:18.70
Mark Seraleus said this or the Buddha says this and therefore it's it's it's correct

1461
01:50:19.26 --> 01:50:23.90
They very well might be correct but let's get the argument not to not to use their quotes

1462
01:50:24.14 --> 01:50:30.54
Why don't you come up with something to stand on your own two feet yeah again nothing wrong with using the guidance of the ancients

1463
01:50:30.86 --> 01:50:33.10
Right there's nothing wrong with that that's brilliant

1464
01:50:33.82 --> 01:50:38.94
From all these books the Bible's got all kinds of things in it that are very impactful great

1465
01:50:40.30 --> 01:50:41.58
Great

1466
01:50:41.58 --> 01:50:51.34
Proverbs to live by but you know what where did they come from and why not figure out how to use them or how to how to make them stand on their own two feet

1467
01:50:51.34 --> 01:50:56.78
Where you not just pointing to you know well it says this there it's the book says this Mark Seraleus said that

1468
01:50:57.02 --> 01:50:59.02
Buddha said this other thing no

1469
01:51:00.22 --> 01:51:02.22
No, let's let's develop our

1470
01:51:02.22 --> 01:51:10.54
Not develop our own but let's make sure we test what we're saying we believe what we're saying that's how I ended up where I'm at so

1471
01:51:11.42 --> 01:51:15.98
You know kind of a rough path to take some things in life you got to learn on your own

1472
01:51:15.98 --> 01:51:19.10
No, yeah, yeah a lot mostly times unfortunately yeah

1473
01:51:20.86 --> 01:51:24.30
Unfortunately a lot of things you got to learn only through experience

1474
01:51:24.30 --> 01:51:33.50
We weep we weep when I was a bag of just just like rank just like I can't say like echo I'll rank you

1475
01:51:33.66 --> 01:51:39.98
Therefore you'll do it this way yeah just like that I also can't say echo I did it this way in the past

1476
01:51:40.14 --> 01:51:44.14
Therefore it's the correct way to do it those are equally bad arguments. Yeah

1477
01:51:44.78 --> 01:51:46.30
Don't do them yeah

1478
01:51:46.30 --> 01:51:52.38
I hear that a lot that when you know especially when when I first got into reading I

1479
01:51:52.38 --> 01:51:59.10
Well more so than hear it I kind of think about that where I could be like hey, you know if I come across

1480
01:51:59.10 --> 01:52:04.86
Situation where I'm gonna apply some knowledge that I learned and if I'm in a situation where I got to

1481
01:52:05.66 --> 01:52:09.10
Come day the the merits of that knowledge, you know

1482
01:52:09.74 --> 01:52:14.14
It does feel weird to be like hey the book said it this way and more like you're just this like blind

1483
01:52:14.14 --> 01:52:21.74
I mean per like you don't really understand the value of what you learn you just oh it's said to do it you know if you have to

1484
01:52:22.38 --> 01:52:28.06
If you have to refer to the source without if I just say echo we need to do this way because the book said this

1485
01:52:28.70 --> 01:52:34.30
No, that's not a good answer what you should be saying is that you know I read this and here's what I see to apply and here's what this book says

1486
01:52:34.30 --> 01:52:38.14
But this is what I think it you know you can use it maybe to help your your

1487
01:52:38.54 --> 01:52:42.46
arguments but don't let your argument rest on this thing

1488
01:52:42.46 --> 01:52:46.06
You know yeah, that's my opinion yeah know yourself

1489
01:52:47.26 --> 01:52:54.78
I'm gonna go in 100% agree with you and I was gonna say unless that book is about putting together your computer then you just follow the book

1490
01:52:55.10 --> 01:52:57.10
But

1491
01:52:57.66 --> 01:53:02.70
When you really think about it still it still holds up you should understand the computer and how it works

1492
01:53:02.70 --> 01:53:04.70
Yeah, I'm not gonna get into that game

1493
01:53:04.70 --> 01:53:10.70
Okay

1494
01:53:14.30 --> 01:53:17.42
What do you do on the days when you're just not feeling it?

1495
01:53:19.82 --> 01:53:21.82
Those days

1496
01:53:23.74 --> 01:53:29.50
Those days when I'm tired or worn out or

1497
01:53:30.54 --> 01:53:32.06
Just

1498
01:53:32.06 --> 01:53:37.66
Basically sick of the grind what do I do on those days?

1499
01:53:39.82 --> 01:53:41.82
I go anyways

1500
01:53:42.94 --> 01:53:50.46
I get it done even if I'm just going through the motions I go through the motions

1501
01:53:51.74 --> 01:53:54.78
I don't really want to work out I work out

1502
01:53:56.30 --> 01:53:59.10
I really don't want to hammer on a project

1503
01:53:59.10 --> 01:54:02.14
I hammer on the project

1504
01:54:03.26 --> 01:54:06.38
Don't really want to get up and get out of bed

1505
01:54:08.70 --> 01:54:11.74
Yeah, I get up and get out of bed

1506
01:54:13.74 --> 01:54:14.86
Now

1507
01:54:14.86 --> 01:54:16.14
These

1508
01:54:16.14 --> 01:54:23.26
Could be signals that you need some time off and those signals might be right

1509
01:54:25.34 --> 01:54:27.10
They could be correct but

1510
01:54:27.10 --> 01:54:29.10
Don't

1511
01:54:29.10 --> 01:54:31.10
Take today off

1512
01:54:31.10 --> 01:54:33.10
Today wait until tomorrow

1513
01:54:33.90 --> 01:54:40.78
Don't give in to the immediate gratification that is whispering in your ear

1514
01:54:43.42 --> 01:54:50.94
Shut that down do not listen to that little voice instead go through the motions

1515
01:54:50.94 --> 01:54:58.22
Lift the weights sprint the hill work on the project get out of bed

1516
01:55:01.18 --> 01:55:05.34
That as an overall rule I do not like procrastination

1517
01:55:06.30 --> 01:55:08.62
You need to get things done

1518
01:55:12.22 --> 01:55:20.06
But if you are going to rest that is one thing that you should procrastinate on

1519
01:55:20.06 --> 01:55:23.10
That's the one thing I want you to put off until tomorrow and

1520
01:55:24.78 --> 01:55:26.78
If when tomorrow comes

1521
01:55:27.90 --> 01:55:33.74
You still feel like you need to rest or you need to take a break then okay

1522
01:55:35.66 --> 01:55:37.66
Take

1523
01:55:38.30 --> 01:55:40.78
But the chances are you won't

1524
01:55:41.74 --> 01:55:48.38
You won't need that rest chances are you will realize that the desire to rest will is just weakness

1525
01:55:48.38 --> 01:55:50.38
It was just

1526
01:55:50.38 --> 01:55:56.70
the desire to take the path of least resistance the downhill path the easy path

1527
01:55:59.34 --> 01:56:02.14
And by simply going through the motions

1528
01:56:04.70 --> 01:56:10.30
You overcame that path and you stayed on the righteous path the discipline path

1529
01:56:11.10 --> 01:56:13.10
You're stayed on the war path

1530
01:56:13.10 --> 01:56:17.82
Which is right where you know

1531
01:56:20.22 --> 01:56:22.22
That you belong

1532
01:56:26.46 --> 01:56:28.46
And I think that's all

1533
01:56:29.26 --> 01:56:31.26
I've got for tonight

1534
01:56:32.30 --> 01:56:34.30
Echo before we go

1535
01:56:34.30 --> 01:56:39.26
Is there any way that people can support this podcast? Well, yes, there is actually

1536
01:56:39.26 --> 01:56:41.26
Um

1537
01:56:41.82 --> 01:56:44.62
All right, yeah, we'll go over a couple ways the

1538
01:56:45.98 --> 01:56:47.98
Supplements

1539
01:56:48.22 --> 01:56:50.22
That's more supporting yourself

1540
01:56:50.70 --> 01:56:55.26
Ultimately because you do get 10% off any good good supplements which is rare for mind you

1541
01:56:55.74 --> 01:57:00.30
But anyway on it is the company it's on it dot com slash jockel. That's how you get 10% off

1542
01:57:02.86 --> 01:57:04.86
Alphabrain for your brain

1543
01:57:04.86 --> 01:57:10.06
Shroom tech for your performance body performance

1544
01:57:12.14 --> 01:57:14.14
Warrior bars for your stomach

1545
01:57:15.18 --> 01:57:21.90
Yeah, bro, I was in we're my friends came over from Arizona's past weekend and

1546
01:57:22.78 --> 01:57:26.78
I worked out of whatever that we're still cooking so I busted out a warrior bar

1547
01:57:26.78 --> 01:57:33.18
And we're cruising and all the kids two two years three years old six years old and then the eight my warrior bars

1548
01:57:33.18 --> 01:57:35.18
Hmm

1549
01:57:35.18 --> 01:57:38.46
There's a little bit of spice to it did then did they then start getting after it

1550
01:57:41.18 --> 01:57:46.38
Yeah, but in the spirit of accuracy they had been getting after it big time even before that but

1551
01:57:47.58 --> 01:57:50.78
Anyway the point there is that they do taste good even three year olds

1552
01:57:52.30 --> 01:57:58.06
Don't mind a little spice that's how good they taste yeah not to say that you're a three year old if you eat them though

1553
01:57:58.54 --> 01:58:00.54
They're good for ain't they're warrior bars

1554
01:58:00.54 --> 01:58:07.58
Yeah, but for me gluten free by the they didn't call them three year olds no bars no they didn't call them formula

1555
01:58:07.58 --> 01:58:11.18
They didn't call them that it's warrior bars. Yeah, no, they're good though

1556
01:58:11.58 --> 01:58:17.98
When I go on trips now like I go to speak with a company or I'm going to work with they you know a lot of times they provide lunch

1557
01:58:19.02 --> 01:58:20.54
A lot of times now

1558
01:58:20.54 --> 01:58:22.54
There's a warrior bar so

1559
01:58:23.10 --> 01:58:29.18
Oh, man, that's advanced. There's there. They're they're fully engaged. Yeah, we're doing what's awesome

1560
01:58:29.18 --> 01:58:32.94
And you mentioned us training. Thank you for that by the way

1561
01:58:33.58 --> 01:58:39.90
Bring that up again. Uh, that I was gonna take some trueme tech just to be like today's the day

1562
01:58:41.26 --> 01:58:43.26
And I didn't

1563
01:58:44.06 --> 01:58:45.26
That was

1564
01:58:45.26 --> 01:58:47.90
Yeah, you understand yeah, and I also

1565
01:58:48.38 --> 01:58:53.98
You know when we got done yesterday I kind of led you in I said hey, you know, man, you know what the years the deal

1566
01:58:53.98 --> 01:59:00.70
Because it just for just to put this in context. Yes, they're not a good day for echo on the mess. It was the thing it started good

1567
01:59:01.26 --> 01:59:04.94
Okay, in my opinion given Mike my trajectory learning

1568
01:59:07.98 --> 01:59:12.62
Wasn't a great thing right for echo on the map. It was a day of of

1569
01:59:14.78 --> 01:59:17.34
You know, they say either you win or you look you learn

1570
01:59:17.90 --> 01:59:22.38
I learned a lot. Yes, yeah, just look at some so we get done and you know

1571
01:59:22.38 --> 01:59:26.46
We're doing a little debrief. We got big Andy there too and I went over to something Andy as like, hey, man

1572
01:59:26.46 --> 01:59:31.74
I really feel this good for you and it's due and I sit down next to echo and I said hey, man, you know

1573
01:59:32.62 --> 01:59:37.98
I don't know you don't tell you just you know normally when you roll you feel like

1574
01:59:38.78 --> 01:59:42.14
You know about this level and then today you felt about

1575
01:59:42.78 --> 01:59:50.22
I don't know about maybe 19% worse and of course he didn't have his his rash his his podcast rash guard on

1576
01:59:50.22 --> 01:59:52.22
So I

1577
01:59:51.90 --> 01:59:55.10
He was actually thinking I was gonna tell them that was some real it

1578
01:59:55.50 --> 01:59:58.70
But maybe there are some the drill there. I don't know. No probably

1579
01:59:59.50 --> 02:00:04.54
Nonetheless, yeah, so it could be attributed to one of those two things. I didn't take shrimp tack

1580
02:00:05.98 --> 02:00:10.30
And I didn't have my rash guard so one of those is then yeah, well, I like what you're doing here

1581
02:00:10.30 --> 02:00:12.30
Instead of blaming me yeah

1582
02:00:12.54 --> 02:00:17.74
You're taking the blame on yourself. Yeah, what's the thing a really good craftsman blames his tools?

1583
02:00:17.74 --> 02:00:20.14
Yeah, I think that's the actual saying

1584
02:00:21.26 --> 02:00:23.90
Anyway, back to the true tech

1585
02:00:24.78 --> 02:00:31.58
That's a good one for performance. Oh, I'll frame good too anyway on it. I'm slash jockel 10% off support your wallet

1586
02:00:33.66 --> 02:00:36.70
Levated by 10% or give it a 10% break

1587
02:00:37.58 --> 02:00:39.58
Yeah, there you go

1588
02:00:40.30 --> 02:00:46.38
And it supports this podcast, you know, it's like a circle of support like on it supports us we like support on it

1589
02:00:46.38 --> 02:00:48.38
We think that

1590
02:00:49.02 --> 02:00:53.02
Technically even if on it wasn't like we weren't sponsored by on it

1591
02:00:54.30 --> 02:00:58.70
I have true tech I've been taking shrimp tech before that so it's kind of like you know anyway

1592
02:00:59.50 --> 02:01:05.74
Circle of support there. Um another good way Amazon Amazon click through you go to the website talk about cast.com

1593
02:01:05.74 --> 02:01:07.74
Click through the Amazon link. It's also on the store

1594
02:01:09.42 --> 02:01:13.42
Click through before you do your holiday shopping or any shopping

1595
02:01:13.42 --> 02:01:17.42
That's a really good way the key there

1596
02:01:18.78 --> 02:01:24.22
Is to remember to do it and doesn't cost you anything what do you put a sticky on your computer?

1597
02:01:24.78 --> 02:01:26.78
Yeah, um that's a really good way to support

1598
02:01:28.46 --> 02:01:30.46
This podcast does a lot

1599
02:01:31.98 --> 02:01:35.26
Costs you nothing and provides good support you

1600
02:01:36.46 --> 02:01:41.10
And it's really kind of invisible to you other than that little motion

1601
02:01:41.10 --> 02:01:46.62
So that sounds like a really good way to support the podcast. It's kind of like every see everyone Jeff be both

1602

1606
02:01:58.86 --> 02:02:05.82
From a couple shillings at the podcast here seems like a good plan to me. We support that. Yeah, yeah, that's good

1607
02:02:05.82 --> 02:02:12.54
Clicking through Amazon is kind of you know when you watch saving private right? Yeah, you know at the end

1608
02:02:12.86 --> 02:02:16.46
When the support comes saves everybody yeah, it's not that big of a

1609
02:02:17.66 --> 02:02:22.86
I mean we want the support but it's not saving people's lives but it's kind of dope like that. I'm saying you know

02:03:39.98 --> 02:03:44.86
The you know the packing that they send the packages for those of you that don't know that's the crew

1626
02:03:44.86 --> 02:03:52.78
Yeah, that to be behind the scenes that that packages up that packages you know and they get after it like they like Ali will be

1627
02:03:54.70 --> 02:04:01.58
Like if someone's from I forget where but it was like Dale King was one of them or show right like gocubs or you know

1633
02:04:25.90 --> 02:04:28.22
Yeah, maybe none the last little reason ever get up

1634
02:04:29.82 --> 02:04:32.62
Even they were like dang these are really good shirts

1635
02:04:33.82 --> 02:04:35.82

19-ish percent improvement so far how holding up that claim has been holding up UFC fighters confirmed me

1640
02:04:54.70 --> 02:04:57.42
Jockel confirming with me when I do have my rash guard and I was

1641
02:04:58.38 --> 02:05:00.38
90 percent last effective

1642
02:05:01.66 --> 02:05:03.66
Anyway, and they happen to look

1643
02:05:03.66 --> 02:05:07.10
Really good according to the feedback I've been getting

1644
02:05:08.06 --> 02:05:15.98
So anyway if you go to jockelstore.com you can look at them and look at the girls t-shirts and the other shirts on there if you like them get one support that way

1645
02:05:17.10 --> 02:05:18.94
Represent

1646
02:05:18.94 --> 02:05:21.42
Also who the easiest of course, what he's there out?

1647
02:05:21.98 --> 02:05:28.30
Chili outside. Oh, yeah, it is. You know, it's like a heavier way. It's not the heavy heavy heavy

1648
02:05:28.30 --> 02:05:34.22
That's for heavy. Is everything? Yeah, it's not like snow, you know, look too heavy. Well, because someone emailed me

1649
02:05:35.10 --> 02:05:41.26
I gotta remember all the people like actually ask these specific questions, but he was like how heavy is it is it?

1650
02:05:42.86 --> 02:05:50.38
Oh, well, it was a brand cart cart cart cart cart cart cart. Yeah, is it like I understand a cart heart that that's gonna you know

1651
02:05:50.94 --> 02:05:57.42

1652
02:05:57.42 --> 02:06:00.30
So I'm like you know, how is it comparatively it's not that?

1653
02:06:01.26 --> 02:06:03.26
It's not Arctic conditions. It's like

1654
02:06:05.10 --> 02:06:07.10
Like cocaine conditions

1655
02:06:08.38 --> 02:06:11.78
Okay, what's that? Monicae how about that? It's monicae a condition

1656
02:06:12.06 --> 02:06:15.10
Cokay is a mountain on koai where you go up. It's like it's

1657
02:06:16.06 --> 02:06:18.06
Yeah, it's a good one

1658
02:06:21.82 --> 02:06:25.98
Anyway, it's like it's almost the heaviest as far as who he's go, but anyway

1659
02:06:25.98 --> 02:06:29.10
They're good check to Zad if you like I'm quite support that like I want to know

1660
02:06:29.74 --> 02:06:32.70
Keep yourself kind of warm or like it you know as far as when you work out

1661
02:06:32.70 --> 02:06:34.70
It's tough or just wearing them

1662
02:06:35.02 --> 02:06:36.30
So yeah, there it is

1663
02:06:36.86 --> 02:06:39.66
Of course subscribe YouTube I'm putting more videos

1664
02:06:39.66 --> 02:06:42.86
But currently I'm putting more put one the other day. I'm put one today

1665
02:06:43.10 --> 02:06:48.38
They're like little bite size like bits, you know because sometimes you don't want to listen to the two hours especially on YouTube

1666
02:06:49.18 --> 02:06:53.50
You just want to listen how do I like like recover from setbacks at work?

1667
02:06:53.50 --> 02:06:55.50
Jocco jocco make nuggets

1668
02:07:01.02 --> 02:07:03.34
Exactly right so you can you know you can

1669
02:07:04.38 --> 02:07:10.86
Look at them for like shoulders time like three to I don't know eight minutes or something or if you know if you know someone who's like

1670
02:07:10.86 --> 02:07:12.86
Hey, you were asking me this question remember

1671
02:07:13.66 --> 02:07:17.50
You send them that bowl advice like shareable advice kind of thing

1672
02:07:17.82 --> 02:07:22.06
Anyway, that's like what you're doing there. Yeah, so subscribe to YouTube you can support that way

1673
02:07:22.06 --> 02:07:24.06
And I do and of course

1674
02:07:24.06 --> 02:07:26.46
Oh, you got a problem here's a two and a half hour

1675
02:07:27.66 --> 02:07:33.18
It's like when people were like hey, I'm trying to get over the situation at work and then they say hey read this book

1676
02:07:33.18 --> 02:07:39.82
I'm like bro, I go to work tomorrow. Yeah. Yeah. I need no now. Yeah, that's exactly so it's kind of the same situation with those YouTube

1677
02:07:40.22 --> 02:07:45.42
Like like sides videos or you can just revisit the subject matter

1678
02:07:45.82 --> 02:07:49.02
You know, I mean like if you listen to it, let me go read yeah, let me read it

1679
02:07:49.02 --> 02:07:55.50
course you're in course exactly so there you go and then yeah, right a review and I it doesn't take you long to cut those things out

1680
02:07:56.86 --> 02:08:04.30
Because I think you should just put a massive number of those out. Yeah, just to be on there right yeah a lot of times I'll think of it in terms of like

1681
02:08:05.66 --> 02:08:09.50
You know how when you put out the podcast every week. It's like the new ones on let me check it out

1682
02:08:09.50 --> 02:08:16.06
So a lot of times I just I'm like dogmatic in that way where I just I think just through habit I think of it that way

1683
02:08:16.06 --> 02:08:19.74
So I'm like okay, I'm gonna bite that way you just put one

1684
02:08:19.74 --> 02:08:23.74
Conaletted marinade for a little while before you put it, but yeah, I should think about that way

1685
02:08:23.74 --> 02:08:29.50
It just needs to be on there think of it this way is everything in it that way think of it this way when you put one out that's

1686
02:08:30.14 --> 02:08:34.22
Five minutes and fifty six seconds long five minutes and fifty six late

1687
02:08:35.34 --> 02:08:37.34
Later moment later

1688
02:08:38.38 --> 02:08:43.66
That someone's waiting for the next one. Yeah, so hook them up. Yeah, take care of some people echo Charles

1689
02:08:43.66 --> 02:08:45.66
All right, let's do that. I'm in

1690
02:08:46.94 --> 02:08:48.94
Yeah, and boom there you go

1691
02:08:49.58 --> 02:08:51.58
Good a couple other things

1692
02:08:52.30 --> 02:08:57.90
Jockel white tea if you want to get some of that it's probably probably gonna be the only beverage ever gonna want to drink

1693
02:08:57.90 --> 02:09:04.78
I think that there's a time coming in the very near future where when you go to a bar or to a club out at night

1694
02:09:04.78 --> 02:09:06.78
I have a good time

1695
02:09:06.78 --> 02:09:12.70
I think in the future the only thing that they're gonna be selling in the bar in the club in the restaurant

1696
02:09:12.70 --> 02:09:17.34
It's just chocolate tea. There's not gonna be any more beer no more whiskey no more wine

1697
02:09:18.22 --> 02:09:21.02
No more poison that tastes like gasoline

1698
02:09:22.78 --> 02:09:24.78
I declare that those days are numbered

1699
02:09:27.26 --> 02:09:35.50
And I think it's gonna be time people are gonna be wanting to drink something that makes you smarter instead of something that makes you

1700
02:09:35.50 --> 02:09:39.42
Dumber something that makes you stronger instead of making you weaker

1701
02:09:39.42 --> 02:09:44.54
Something that makes you healthier instead of making you sicker

1702
02:09:45.34 --> 02:09:50.06
So that's why I think people are gonna be on it Amazon you can get some of that

1703
02:09:53.10 --> 02:09:56.94
While you're also on Amazon if you like this podcast or what we talked about

1704
02:09:57.50 --> 02:09:59.82
You can get a book and this is sometimes people

1705
02:10:00.62 --> 02:10:07.26
Find the podcast and they haven't read the book extreme ownership by me and my brother, Dave Babin that's pretty normal right

1706
02:10:07.26 --> 02:10:12.78
And sometimes the opposite yeah people got the book and then they got then they found the podcast

1707
02:10:12.86 --> 02:10:17.74
So either way, but I'm just confirming if you're a person that listens to the podcast the book is also there

1708
02:10:17.74 --> 02:10:19.74
You can grab that from Amazon and

1709
02:10:21.82 --> 02:10:23.82
Also if you kind of want to

1710
02:10:24.78 --> 02:10:29.02

Thanks everybody for listening if you're in uniform. Thank you for serving

02:10:56.38 --> 02:10:58.38

Thanks for stopping criminals. Thanks for putting out fires

1721
02:11:02.94 --> 02:11:04.94
Thanks to

1722
02:11:05.10 --> 02:11:09.10
Thanks to all of you in uniform in service

1723
02:11:10.78 --> 02:11:13.74
And the rest of you troopers out there fighting your own fight

1724
02:11:15.50 --> 02:11:17.50
Make it a good fight

1725
02:11:18.06 --> 02:11:23.90
Make it the kind of fight that winter lose you walk off the field of battle knowing

1726
02:11:25.26 --> 02:11:29.66
You gave it everything you could give and you had nothing left

1727
02:11:29.66 --> 02:11:31.66
And that fight

1728
02:11:33.98 --> 02:11:36.22
That fight that I'm talking about is life

1729
02:11:38.30 --> 02:11:47.50
And while I was talking about going through the motion some times when you just haven't got the intrinsic drive to go full on at a task

1730
02:11:48.06 --> 02:11:53.02
Let me tell you what when it comes to life don't just go through the motions

1731
02:11:53.02 --> 02:11:57.02
Leave

1732
02:11:58.46 --> 02:12:00.46
Live fight the good fight

1733
02:12:02.22 --> 02:12:03.82
Live

1734
02:12:03.82 --> 02:12:05.82
Unoutstanding life

1735
02:12:06.38 --> 02:12:11.02
Don't just go through life. Don't just get through it

1736
02:12:13.18 --> 02:12:15.18
Instead

1737
02:12:16.14 --> 02:12:18.14
Get after it

1738
02:12:18.14 --> 02:12:24.70
So until next time this is echo and jockel

1739
02:12:24.70 --> 02:12:49.50
