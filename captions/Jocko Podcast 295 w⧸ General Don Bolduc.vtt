00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
This is Jockel Podcast number 295 with echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink. Good evening, echo.

2
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:16.64
Good evening. On November 14th, 2001, the troops of General Faheen Khan rolled into

3
00:00:16.64 --> 00:00:24.08
Kabul and liberated the city from five years of despotic rule by the Taliban. To win over

4
00:00:24.08 --> 00:00:28.76
the pastions in the south and begin operations against the Taliban, the coalition planned

5
00:00:28.76 --> 00:00:37.24
to insert two ODAs near the city of Kandahar. Major Donald Bulldog was a member of Special

6
00:00:37.24 --> 00:00:45.56
Operations Command and Control element 52, which had tacked control of the two ODAs. Bulldog

7
00:00:45.56 --> 00:00:52.36
explained the mission. Quote. Basically from November 2001 until complete, we were able to

8
00:00:52.36 --> 00:00:59.96
provide C2 and conduct unconventional warfare in order to advise and assist Hamid Kharsai

9
00:00:59.96 --> 00:01:06.20
and Google Sharsai in organizing anti-Taliban forces, which was what they were called at

10
00:01:06.20 --> 00:01:13.64
the time and to conduct combat operations against the Taliban and alkyte forces and quote.

11
00:01:13.64 --> 00:01:20.44
Bulldog further described the key tasks that the ODA had to accomplish with their Afghan

12
00:01:20.44 --> 00:01:27.08
partners quote. We were to secure Kandahar city, develop a plan to stabilize Kandahar city

13
00:01:27.08 --> 00:01:33.56
and operate from a secure base. And then concentrically improve that security from Kandahar

14
00:01:33.56 --> 00:01:39.08
city, which was considered the cultural and religious center of gravity out to other provinces

15
00:01:39.08 --> 00:01:47.48
in the south and then on order, extra trait the operational area. Coalition leaders also

16
00:01:47.48 --> 00:01:53.16
understood that they could not simply leave the area once Kandahar was out of the Taliban

17
00:01:53.16 --> 00:02:01.72
grip, but had to set conditions for the next phase of the campaign. Major Bulldog asserted

18
00:02:01.72 --> 00:02:09.72
that the end state for the ODAs was the creation of a quote, stable, safe and secure Kandahar

19
00:02:09.72 --> 00:02:16.84
city ready to transition to more formalized humanitarian assistance and nation building operations.

20
00:02:21.24 --> 00:02:29.08
And that right there is a excerpt from a document that was written by the combat studies institute

21
00:02:29.08 --> 00:02:35.80
press of the U.S. Army School at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, and the document is called a different

22
00:02:35.80 --> 00:02:44.12
kind of war. The United States Army in operation and during freedom from October 2001 to September

23
00:02:44.12 --> 00:02:57.24
2005. And when you think about that segment that I opened up with, that's 14 November, that's just

24
00:02:57.24 --> 00:03:05.56
over two months after September 11, 2001, 60 days. And in that minimal amount of time,

25
00:03:07.16 --> 00:03:21.96
America went from peace and relative tranquility to war and to chaos. And men in the military who had

26
00:03:21.96 --> 00:03:30.12
been planning another standard day at work or preparing for another training exercise or maybe

27
00:03:30.12 --> 00:03:36.36
planning to take a billet where they could go get some more time with their family. Suddenly,

28
00:03:37.56 --> 00:03:46.20
these men were at war. The opening piece I read mentioned major Don Bulldog.

29
00:03:46.20 --> 00:03:56.60
He was obviously one of those men that shipped off to Afghanistan to begin trying to sort

30
00:03:56.60 --> 00:04:00.76
that place out. And that first appointment in 2001 was just the beginning for him.

31
00:04:01.96 --> 00:04:08.36
Over the following years, he would deploy to Afghanistan over and over and over again and also

32
00:04:08.36 --> 00:04:15.64
to Iraq and other parts of the world that were under threat. And that major would finish out

33
00:04:15.64 --> 00:04:22.76
his career as a Brigadier General. And it's an honor to have him here tonight to share some of his

34
00:04:22.76 --> 00:04:29.48
experiences and lessons learned. General Bulldog. Thank you for joining us. Well, thank you for having

35
00:04:29.48 --> 00:04:35.32
me. It's an honor to be here. You know, as I was reading that and just saw that date of November

36
00:04:35.32 --> 00:04:44.52
14th, 2001. And I was in the military at that time. But to think of the radical transformation that

37
00:04:44.52 --> 00:04:51.80
was about to take place and how quickly we went from this sort of peace time military to a war time

38
00:04:51.80 --> 00:05:00.68
military and all that that entailed. That's a that's a heavy situation. Let's do this. Let's

39
00:05:00.68 --> 00:05:08.52
rewind a little bit and learn a little bit about you where you came from, how you grew up and sort

40
00:05:08.52 --> 00:05:14.12
of how you ended up in the situation that you're in right now. Sure. So, so let's start at the beginning.

41
00:05:16.04 --> 00:05:20.68
So, the beginning. I was born in La Coney, a new Hampshire. I've been a resident of the state of

42
00:05:20.68 --> 00:05:27.88
New Hampshire for 59 years and I'm 59 years old. I learned my work ethic on our family farm and

43
00:05:27.88 --> 00:05:36.36
geofrid, new Hampshire. We had a dairy farm. We had a vegetable farm, maple syrup. The farm has been

44
00:05:36.36 --> 00:05:45.000
in existence since 1779. Our family is the second owner of that farm. My grandfather bought it in 18.

45
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:58.44
My great grandfather bought it in 1899 coming down from Canada. And my grandfather had 13 children.

46
00:05:58.44 --> 00:06:09.08
And my dad was seven of the 13. And what us bald ex-did was we worked farm. That's how we learned.

47
00:06:10.44 --> 00:06:18.76
We planted gardens chopped wood. You know, back in the day we'd in the deep snow. My brother and I like

48
00:06:20.44 --> 00:06:26.76
we had our harnesses and we would pull the sleds and we would dump the maple syrup into the

49
00:06:26.76 --> 00:06:35.96
container. Now it's all done by gravity through plastic pipes right into the sappaus.

50
00:06:36.76 --> 00:06:47.24
Before it was done by good old fashioned grandchildren, right? You know? And so, I wouldn't trade

51
00:06:47.24 --> 00:06:50.76
that for anything. It got me tough in the winter, tough in the summer, tough in the fall.

52
00:06:51.32 --> 00:06:55.80
I built more stone walls than I needed to do. So, moving rocks from point A to point P was never

53
00:06:55.80 --> 00:07:01.64
a problem. I went to Catholic school and got my butt kicked by nuns on a regular basis.

54
00:07:03.56 --> 00:07:07.40
And so, when I went to basic training in 1981 after high school,

55
00:07:09.08 --> 00:07:15.48
putting a dude at me, wake me up early. Y'all at me? I don't know how many times my dad told me

56
00:07:15.48 --> 00:07:20.44
I was about as useful as a snowball in hell. You know what I mean? But he, you know, he loved me.

57
00:07:20.44 --> 00:07:24.60
Right? He was just trying to prepare me for the world. You know? It's not going to be easy out there.

58
00:07:24.60 --> 00:07:30.44
You got to use your head, right? What made you enlist in the army? My grandfather on the

59
00:07:30.44 --> 00:07:35.56
bald side had a policy that all baldic males will serve their country. He didn't care if it was

60
00:07:35.56 --> 00:07:39.88
a national guard, reserves, active duty of what service it was, but you will serve and if you don't

61
00:07:39.88 --> 00:07:45.80
serve, you're not welcome. And he never served because when he got here, he was too old.

62
00:07:45.80 --> 00:07:58.44
He was too old for World War I, but he nonetheless, I had uncles that served. World War II,

63
00:07:59.88 --> 00:08:06.12
Korea, Vietnam, every conflict in the bald exhibit, since World War II. Right? And we didn't get

64
00:08:06.12 --> 00:08:14.84
here until 1899. And so my grandfather had to establish some children and some grandchildren before

65
00:08:14.84 --> 00:08:24.60
he could start populating the US military. But when I went into the, I went into my recruiter in the

66
00:08:24.60 --> 00:08:29.16
11th grade because I knew I had to do it. So I went in in 11th grade and at that time they had the

67
00:08:29.16 --> 00:08:35.08
delayed entry program where if you joined early, you got credit for that service. Plus,

68
00:08:35.08 --> 00:08:41.48
you went in as a mosquito wing private, you know, instead of just a slick sleeve private, right?

69
00:08:41.48 --> 00:08:46.84
Which was like, you know, $5 more a month. Right? And back then it was double your basic

70
00:08:46.84 --> 00:08:52.36
patch. That's right back then it was $200 a month. So I was pretty happy, right? So it was good. And

71
00:08:54.52 --> 00:09:01.48
you know, before that though in high school, I joined the police cadet program in

72
00:09:01.48 --> 00:09:10.92
Lekonia, New Hampshire. And that's a funny story how that started, right? I was in 10th grade

73
00:09:10.92 --> 00:09:18.68
and we were walking over from high school. After school, but before we had to leave for a football

74
00:09:18.68 --> 00:09:24.28
game. And it was an away game and I was walking over the group of the guys over to the, to the

75
00:09:24.28 --> 00:09:32.68
little store to pick up some, some child for the bus, right? And, and I, uh, there was this

76
00:09:32.68 --> 00:09:40.12
coat can set up perfectly right on the curb of the road. And I thought, man, I'm going to go kick

77
00:09:40.12 --> 00:09:47.08
that. So I started talking about, you know, uh, and five seconds left in the game. But, you know,

78
00:09:47.08 --> 00:09:53.72
I kicked that ball. I kicked that can. And it hit the side of a police cruiser,

79
00:09:53.72 --> 00:10:04.76
parked at the light. And so I know him now, starting being us, jumps out of that car and he is

80
00:10:04.76 --> 00:10:10.76
pissed off. And everybody get on the ground so we're all laying on the ground. And he's like, who did it?

81
00:10:10.76 --> 00:10:15.96
So my raise my hand, I go, I did it, sir. And he puts me in the back of the cruiser and

82
00:10:15.96 --> 00:10:23.40
he's yelling at the other kids and, you know, my friends and they ran off and I'm sitting in the

83
00:10:23.40 --> 00:10:29.72
cruiser and he goes, so, would you do that for? And I explained to him what I was doing and he said,

84
00:10:29.72 --> 00:10:35.56
all right, sounds like an accident to me. He goes, if you're heard of the police get up program,

85
00:10:35.56 --> 00:10:42.84
I go, no, sir. He goes, well, I think you'd be a good kid for that program, right? Because

86
00:10:42.84 --> 00:10:49.48
you had enough balls to own up to it, you know? And I said, all right, so I did it and I got selected

87
00:10:49.48 --> 00:10:59.24
and I started out and I really loved it. So in 1980, year before I graduated from my school, I

88
00:11:00.52 --> 00:11:08.28
had the opportunity to go through the part-time police academy program. And so I did it and

89
00:11:08.28 --> 00:11:13.32
I ended up getting qualified as a police officer. So when I went into my senior year,

90
00:11:13.32 --> 00:11:17.32
at 18 years old, I was a qualified police officer working for the Co. and a police department.

91
00:11:18.12 --> 00:11:27.16
And I did that for a year before I went into the army and went into the army for

92
00:11:27.16 --> 00:11:38.12
181 to 84. And where are you active duty? I was active duty. Okay, it's basically a little bit like

93
00:11:38.12 --> 00:11:43.72
a break for you because you're not on the dairy farm. That's right, it's a huge break. Well,

94
00:11:43.72 --> 00:11:48.76
it's a huge break because it's not, you know, you can imagine being a police officer while you're

95
00:11:48.76 --> 00:11:54.04
in your senior year high school. Mr. Poppillar? That's right, Mr. Poppillar. Every party that got

96
00:11:54.04 --> 00:11:59.72
busted up was my fault. I obviously had inside information that I passed on to the police.

97
00:12:00.28 --> 00:12:05.80
And it'd done work that way. I mean, we don't care about parties, but your neighbors do,

98
00:12:05.80 --> 00:12:10.76
particularly when it gets too loud. Right, so they call. And I just couldn't get that point across.

99
00:12:10.76 --> 00:12:17.24
But nonetheless, after serving as a police officer and, you know, I mean,

100
00:12:17.24 --> 00:12:25.40
you know, my dad was a taskmaster, right? I mean, he was a strong good man who is no longer with us,

101
00:12:25.40 --> 00:12:35.72
but nonetheless served 35 years as a city councilman and mayor for our city school board,

102
00:12:36.92 --> 00:12:43.40
just a great pillar of the community in addition to being a, you know, a guy that would

103
00:12:43.40 --> 00:12:50.04
do anything for anybody. And so anyways, I had learned all that stuff, but working on the dairy farm,

104
00:12:50.60 --> 00:12:55.48
you know, hanging, hangs the worst thing you can do in the world, right? I mean, I hated hanging

105
00:12:55.48 --> 00:13:00.44
season. When July rolled around, I prayed for rain because we couldn't, we didn't, you couldn't,

106
00:13:00.44 --> 00:13:06.92
he can't hang in the rain. But it didn't happen, right? I had a guy who was a new guy

107
00:13:06.92 --> 00:13:15.64
came to work for me when I was at Seal team 7. And he was a hard work and kid up, ready to move

108
00:13:15.64 --> 00:13:21.48
sandbags, fill sandbags, move steel around, dump ammo, pick up ammo, whatever I need him to,

109
00:13:21.48 --> 00:13:26.20
find me after a couple weeks and I'm not too impressed. You have to be a really hard worker

110
00:13:26.20 --> 00:13:32.36
to impress me. And after a few weeks, I said to him, I said, hey, band, you're, because I, he had

111
00:13:32.36 --> 00:13:35.88
kind of just shown up in my platoon. He didn't go through our work up or anything. He was a new guy just

112
00:13:35.88 --> 00:13:41.08
showed up in Iraq, showed up in Iraq and he's working his ass off. And I look at him one day and I

113
00:13:41.08 --> 00:13:46.44
said, hey, you're, you're a hard worker, where are you from? And he said, I grew up in a dairy farm

114
00:13:46.44 --> 00:13:52.52
in Minnesota. And I said, well, I appreciate your hard work. He said, sir, I'll do whatever you want

115
00:13:52.52 --> 00:13:59.56
me to do as long as it doesn't have anything to do with cows. And he told me his schedule. He was

116
00:13:59.56 --> 00:14:05.24
up at 4 o'clock in the morning every day to milk cows get home in the afternoon after wrestling

117
00:14:05.24 --> 00:14:10.04
practice milk cows. And it was, I don't know what he had, but 300 or 400 cows he had to milk.

118
00:14:10.04 --> 00:14:16.76
So the dairy farm seems to breed some hard work. Yeah. Well, you know, after practice, whether

119
00:14:16.76 --> 00:14:22.60
it was baseball or football or whatever happened to be, my dad said, I'll see at the farm. And so I

120
00:14:22.60 --> 00:14:30.84
would jog from the high school up, up, moral street to the farm, you know, and, uh, and did

121
00:14:30.84 --> 00:14:35.72
whatever he asked me to do up on the farm. Right. And so when I got the basic training and

122
00:14:35.72 --> 00:14:43.96
met sword and mules, my, uh, my basic training, um, throw instructor. Um, no, he want me to make

123
00:14:43.96 --> 00:14:48.36
my bed. You want me to do this. You want me to do that? Yeah. You know, I was up before he threw

124
00:14:48.36 --> 00:14:55.32
the trash can down the aisle, right? Uh, because that's just the way it was. And, um, and he, you know,

125
00:14:55.32 --> 00:15:01.80
he would say to me, ball it, you don't sleep. I go and I'd say he was drill so hard and I, I do

126
00:15:01.80 --> 00:15:09.64
sleep, but I don't require much. Right. Um, and, uh, you know, so yeah, that kind of hard work did

127
00:15:09.64 --> 00:15:13.88
it. And then the discipline that the nuns instilled in me, I mean, come on. Right. It's just, it's

128
00:15:13.88 --> 00:15:20.44
just a loose seal. Right. I mean, she sounds scary. She is scary. She was a flaming red headed, uh,

129
00:15:20.44 --> 00:15:27.08
none that just scared that hell out of me. And, um, and she got her pound of flesh out of me, uh,

130
00:15:27.08 --> 00:15:32.92
but were you an athlete in high school? I was. Yeah. What sports did you go? I played, uh, football,

131
00:15:32.92 --> 00:15:39.16
baseball, and basketball. And I was told, uh, you're too small to play football, but,

132
00:15:40.36 --> 00:15:46.12
by myself, more years, I was, I was starting on the varsity team. Two short to play basketball,

133
00:15:46.12 --> 00:15:51.96
but I was a starting guard on the basketball team. Uh, I was, they told me I couldn't pitch.

134
00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:57.32
But I ended up being a pitcher because my arms were too short and, and I wasn't tall enough,

135
00:15:57.32 --> 00:16:04.68
and I couldn't get a good stretch off the mound, but, you know, so, uh, I think the farmer in me,

136
00:16:05.48 --> 00:16:09.56
uh, you know, don't tell me I can't do something kind of thing, right? Because, um,

137
00:16:10.84 --> 00:16:15.88
I'm going to try and prove you wrong. Yeah. So anyways, you know, when you enlisted in the army,

138
00:16:15.88 --> 00:16:22.36
did you do it? Did you plan on, was it a career? Was it reserves? Or was it active? No, it actually,

139
00:16:22.36 --> 00:16:27.80
uh, it was active duty. Okay. But my plan was to, um, you know, pursue the law enforcement.

140
00:16:28.36 --> 00:16:35.72
So when I was coming out of the army in 1984, I was a sergeant, and I was going to ROTC,

141
00:16:36.52 --> 00:16:41.40
green to gold program, uh, not to go on active duty, but it was through the national guard.

142
00:16:41.40 --> 00:16:47.16
And they were going to pay for my education, and I was going to get my commission through ROTC.

143
00:16:47.16 --> 00:16:51.96
In a beauty part about prior services, you don't have to do the first two years of ROTC,

144
00:16:51.96 --> 00:16:57.96
because you've got basic training in a.e. t.n. to your belt. So you start it, you're junior and senior years, right?

145
00:16:58.52 --> 00:17:06.28
And I didn't, uh, I didn't anticipate making it a career at all. Um, I wanted to be, uh,

146
00:17:06.28 --> 00:17:12.12
being law enforcement, but I got called down to my company commander's office, and my first

147
00:17:12.12 --> 00:17:17.32
serge was there, first sergeant Kingston, and in, uh, Captain Jeffrey L. A.s.

148
00:17:18.76 --> 00:17:23.24
was there, and he, I reported to him, position of attention, and he said,

149
00:17:23.24 --> 00:17:27.64
sergeant Bouldek, I know you're getting out, uh, but I want to talk to you about that,

150
00:17:27.64 --> 00:17:32.12
because I think you should stay in. I think you should reinlist, and I, you just came down on

151
00:17:32.12 --> 00:17:35.72
drill sergeant orders, and you should go be a drill sergeant, because what are your plans?

152
00:17:36.68 --> 00:17:41.48
And I, so I just explained, oh, what I explained to you, and he said, yeah, I, I just don't see you

153
00:17:42.52 --> 00:17:48.52
being successful as an officer. He said, you're enlisted material. You're, you're a sergeant major in the making,

154
00:17:48.52 --> 00:17:52.60
you know, so I think you should stay in, and you should fall that track, because you're going to have the most

155
00:17:52.60 --> 00:17:57.40
success with that. And again, this little light in the back of my head, did you just tell me I can't do something

156
00:17:57.40 --> 00:18:03.56
like kind of thing, and, uh, and my, you know, I took his advice, and I said, thank you,

157
00:18:03.56 --> 00:18:09.72
you're very much, but I followed the different path. Well, first sergeant Kingston calls me out

158
00:18:09.72 --> 00:18:14.20
in his office. He puts me in a front-lean and rest position, and he says, you count loud to 50.

159
00:18:15.24 --> 00:18:18.52
And he gets down real close to my ear, and he goes, hey, listen, he goes,

160
00:18:18.52 --> 00:18:30.36
you take, and you go to ROTC, and then when you get commissioned, you find wherever this captain is,

161
00:18:30.36 --> 00:18:35.16
in the United States of Army, and you take those bars, and you put it somewhere the sun doesn't

162
00:18:35.16 --> 00:18:41.80
show. That's what he says to me, and I go, yes, first sergeant, has I'm, you know,

163
00:18:41.80 --> 00:18:47.80
22 for a sergeant, 23. And you know, he's, so he's like, he's like, get up, so I get up and he

164
00:18:47.80 --> 00:18:54.60
dismisses me. And I am a first lieutenant in special forces training at Fort Bragg North Carolina,

165
00:18:54.60 --> 00:18:59.72
and who's the command sergeant major of the 16th Military Police Brigade. Sergeant, command

166
00:18:59.72 --> 00:19:07.80
sergeant, Major Kingston. So here I am, a first lieutenant in S.F. training, and I called his office,

167
00:19:07.80 --> 00:19:11.72
and I told him who I was, and I asked if I could come over and have a meeting with him,

168
00:19:11.72 --> 00:19:16.92
so they did that, and I went over and I met with him, and he was so happy to see me, right?

169
00:19:16.92 --> 00:19:21.64
He goes, have you found Captain Ames? And I go, no, and he goes, you know, he's a lieutenant

170
00:19:21.64 --> 00:19:28.12
Colonel now, and I go, no, I didn't know it. I didn't, I haven't tracked his career, but anyway, see,

171
00:19:29.56 --> 00:19:33.72
he goes, I remember that day that was hilarious, and he goes, I'm glad you're doing well,

172
00:19:33.72 --> 00:19:38.04
you're in special forces training, because that's really great. And so we, you know,

173
00:19:39.64 --> 00:19:46.04
it's just, I didn't plan on going back on active duty, but I did well in ROTC, and I

174
00:19:46.04 --> 00:19:50.84
qualified for an active, you know, regular Army Commission, and I said, you know what?

175
00:19:51.72 --> 00:20:00.36
This is 1988, and it is not looking good for jobs out there, right? So I said,

176
00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:07.40
ah, I'll just go to Army, and we'll see how that goes. And I really didn't anticipate staying too long as an

177
00:20:07.40 --> 00:20:12.12
officer, you know, fulfill my requirement, you know, and, you know, perhaps get out, but

178
00:20:12.12 --> 00:20:18.44
it's time went on, and I went in special forces, and I'm not sure. So what was your job as an

179
00:20:18.44 --> 00:20:23.16
officer? Were you an infantry officer? I was, I got commissioned into the chemical corps,

180
00:20:23.80 --> 00:20:27.80
which was another thing I was like, what the heck, you know, I graduated number one from

181
00:20:27.80 --> 00:20:35.40
Northeastern University, Liberty Battalion. I was number one, and the explanation I got is,

182
00:20:35.40 --> 00:20:40.52
well, you know, the quality has got to be spread out across the Army, and it's based on needs of the

183
00:20:40.52 --> 00:20:46.76
Army. So I was like, okay, sounds like a good, so what was it chemical officer? Chemical officer,

184
00:20:46.76 --> 00:20:51.32
nuclear biological and chemical officer, but you know what? When I was looking to get out,

185
00:20:51.32 --> 00:20:59.56
after my requirement, wow, that's a good opportunity. Big bucks, great opportunities. I was like,

186
00:20:59.56 --> 00:21:06.36
wow, the good Lord was smiling on me, because, you know, and I went to Ranger School,

187
00:21:06.36 --> 00:21:10.04
and I did all those things that you're supposed to do, so when I showed up at the combat

188
00:21:10.04 --> 00:21:16.20
arms units, right, and I had that, you know, I wasn't just a support guy, right? You know, okay,

189
00:21:16.20 --> 00:21:21.40
this guy, prior and listed Ranger School graduate, you know, Airborne School, you know, the whole

190
00:21:21.40 --> 00:21:26.84
nine yard, and so it just gave you more credibility, and as an enlisted guy served in the fourth

191
00:21:26.84 --> 00:21:34.20
ID in the second Airborne, so I had that in my background, and so it was all good, but, but, you know,

192
00:21:34.20 --> 00:21:39.000
yeah, chemical corps, you get put on the battalion staff, and you have to do the, you know,

193
00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:44.52
you get, you get all the, you know, nobody's really interested in doing nuclear biological and

194
00:21:44.52 --> 00:21:52.84
chemical. So you get, you get all the, you know, the interesting assignments, and I did those

195
00:21:52.84 --> 00:21:58.60
with a smile on my face and the best my ability, and then, you know, I was the first chemical

196
00:21:58.60 --> 00:22:03.48
officer to make it through special forces selection and training. So did you, well, at what

197
00:22:03.48 --> 00:22:09.40
point did you learn about special forces? Well, I learned about special forces in 1968 when I

198
00:22:09.40 --> 00:22:17.08
watched the Green Brave movie with my grandfather, and, and so I was like, oh, wow, John Wayne,

199
00:22:17.08 --> 00:22:22.28
the Green Brave, you know, so it was always something in the back of my mind, and then I was in

200
00:22:22.28 --> 00:22:29.32
Korea, my first lieutenant assignment, and the Green Brave recruited showed up, and I went, and I said,

201
00:22:29.32 --> 00:22:34.52
I'm going to do that, right, and so that's what I did. Where were you in the first goal for

202
00:22:34.52 --> 00:22:43.56
what happened? I was in 10 special forces group, okay, and so we did that there, and then we rotated

203
00:22:43.56 --> 00:22:49.000
over to provide comfort, the humanitarian assistance thing up in Northern Iraq, which was great

204
00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:57.000
experience with the Kurds, and yeah, so I mean, God just kept opening up these little doors

205
00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:07.16
for me to like, you know, scoot through, and before I knew it, it was, you know, I was major on my

206
00:23:07.16 --> 00:23:14.12
way to command a general staff college, and halfway to retirement, you know, 20 years, and I had a few

207
00:23:14.12 --> 00:23:19.96
extra years because I've been with you the time, so I was like, you know, hey, if I make it to Lieutenant

208
00:23:19.96 --> 00:23:25.96
Colonel, I'm going to be doing pretty damn good, so I was pretty happy about that. So, so you went

209
00:23:25.96 --> 00:23:31.24
through special forces in what year, through, through the selection? I went through selection in

210
00:23:31.24 --> 00:23:40.12
1992, February of 1992. How was that? Was it challenging for you? Did you enjoy it? Was it what you

211
00:23:40.12 --> 00:23:47.32
expected it to be? Yeah, I expected a smoke show, and that's what I got, right, and I really likes

212
00:23:47.32 --> 00:23:55.72
the special forces selection process because nobody said anything to you, right? All your

213
00:23:55.72 --> 00:24:00.28
instructions were written up on a board, and you had to be conscientious enough to check that

214
00:24:00.28 --> 00:24:05.80
board frequently because they would do things like change it, right? And then try and catch it,

215
00:24:05.80 --> 00:24:13.88
right, not paying attention. And it was athletic events, you know, that you had to do. It was like

216
00:24:13.88 --> 00:24:20.12
right up my alley, right? So it was like, yeah, good quality smoke show, nobody yelled at you.

217
00:24:20.12 --> 00:24:26.28
They sleep the pride and they gave you really good. I called it, I called it building Barney

218
00:24:26.28 --> 00:24:32.44
Rubble Machines, right, because it was like, oh, here's a trailer with only one tire, and

219
00:24:32.44 --> 00:24:38.44
here's some straps, and here's some poles, and you know, you got to move it 10 kilometers, and

220
00:24:38.44 --> 00:24:42.60
you know, they would set up these tabs, and you had to build like, so it was like on the farm.

221
00:24:42.60 --> 00:24:48.12
Like our farm was like a OSHA nightmare, you know, we really didn't believe in the OSHA

222
00:24:48.12 --> 00:24:54.76
safety hazard. So huge safety hazard, right? And so, you know, coming up with a fix for the

223
00:24:54.76 --> 00:25:00.76
tractor, for the hay bailer, when it went down, or something like that, was, you know,

224
00:25:01.40 --> 00:25:05.64
it was always right there, right? And you know, my dad's like, hey, we don't have, we don't have time,

225
00:25:05.64 --> 00:25:11.40
and we don't have the money to go pay for this machine. So what's, you know, use some nylon,

226
00:25:11.40 --> 00:25:16.76
and some straps, and figure this out, right? And so that's what SF training was about, you know,

227
00:25:16.76 --> 00:25:22.76
it was like, hey, you know, here's a bunch of pieces of equipment, figure out how to get it,

228
00:25:22.76 --> 00:25:29.000
10 kilometers, and good luck, right? And work as a team and support each other. So, you know,

229
00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:33.56
that's what farming is all about. And not one person makes that farm run. It's a collective team.

230
00:25:33.56 --> 00:25:39.16
That's what my grandfather had 13 kids. That's why he has over, you know, 500 grandchildren

231
00:25:40.20 --> 00:25:45.48
to make it work. You bring everybody together, and you just make it work. So that's what I like

232
00:25:45.48 --> 00:25:52.84
about, you know, special forces training. And I like the idea, but not everybody could make it,

233
00:25:52.84 --> 00:25:59.24
right, that there was this huge attrition rate. And so I thought that was cool too, because

234
00:26:00.60 --> 00:26:07.48
it was this, it was a special thing, right? Not everybody can get through, and only

235
00:26:07.48 --> 00:26:12.28
only a certain type of person can get through it. Doesn't make you any better than anybody else,

236
00:26:12.28 --> 00:26:17.56
it just makes you different, right? And that's what America's about. Was there anything that was

237
00:26:17.56 --> 00:26:24.76
hard for you, or especially hard for you? Yeah, anything that required height. Because I'm sure

238
00:26:25.48 --> 00:26:30.44
at 5 foot 7. So, you know, these things that required height, and then keeping up with

239
00:26:31.64 --> 00:26:36.84
guys with long legs on the Ruck March, I would, it was a Ruck jog for me to keep up,

240
00:26:36.84 --> 00:26:44.76
because these guys had just this incredibly long stride, and it was like, God bless America.

241
00:26:44.76 --> 00:26:50.36
Yeah. You know, come on, cut that stride in half, you know, but, you know, they, they move

242
00:26:50.36 --> 00:26:55.48
at their pace, and they can't, they can't be slackened, because, you know, then the instructor

243
00:26:55.48 --> 00:27:01.24
sees their slackened. For me, I'll pick up a job, right? So that's the way we did it.

244
00:27:01.24 --> 00:27:05.32
And you're married when you were going through special forces training, right? Yes, yeah,

245
00:27:05.32 --> 00:27:10.68
yeah, I got married as a second lieutenant. I met my wife Sharon and college.

246
00:27:12.52 --> 00:27:18.44
We were both in the ROTC program together. She was studying nursing, and she was, she joined the

247
00:27:18.44 --> 00:27:24.36
Army at 17 years old, had to get her mom's mission. She went into the medical field, right,

248
00:27:24.36 --> 00:27:31.56
and down to Fort Sam Houston, did her training. And she's a, she's, she's as hard as woodpecker

249
00:27:31.56 --> 00:27:37.64
lips. And I always like, I always like to say, you know, so a surprise for me is that, you know,

250
00:27:37.64 --> 00:27:44.12
I married a woman that wore combat boots. So that was always, that was always a cool thing. But yeah,

251
00:27:44.12 --> 00:27:51.80
she, she was great and, you know, and she, and she, I understand the Army and understood what

252
00:27:51.80 --> 00:27:56.84
you were going through. And I always asked her, right? I said, hey, I want to do this, right?

253
00:27:56.84 --> 00:28:03.000
You know, can I get your support? You know, I mean, it's not going to be easy for the family.

254
00:28:04.20 --> 00:28:11.88
And that's why, you know, leading up to 2001, we had nine, 11, we were gone a lot,

255
00:28:11.88 --> 00:28:17.24
because during the Clinton years, we redound size the conventional forces, a lot of the

256
00:28:17.24 --> 00:28:23.16
engagement and stuff felt a special option. We had to go deploy on all kinds of different things out there.

257
00:28:23.16 --> 00:28:30.20
So we were gone a lot. And so when we were gone a lot after 2001, my wife just took it and

258
00:28:30.20 --> 00:28:36.04
strike, right? And so when she started hearing people say, wow, you know, they never home any more.

259
00:28:36.04 --> 00:28:40.60
And she, she would, she would be able to use her experience to explain, hey, you know, this is,

260
00:28:41.48 --> 00:28:48.44
this is what it's all about, right? And so she was very, very good inside the family readiness

261
00:28:48.44 --> 00:28:55.08
groups and, you know, very, very supportive, particularly during deployments. And, you know, when we

262
00:28:55.08 --> 00:29:03.24
had casualties and she, she had that frame of reference, you know, and she always there, we've been

263
00:29:03.24 --> 00:29:10.60
married for over 32 years now and I have never, she's never, ever, faltered. Even when I, even,

264
00:29:10.60 --> 00:29:14.84
you know, even when I wasn't a very good version of myself because of post-traumatic stress and

265
00:29:14.84 --> 00:29:22.68
traumatic brain injury and, you know, pain management issues and, you know, I mean, that

266
00:29:22.68 --> 00:29:30.36
negatively affected my personal professional life too, you know. When, before we get into that,

267
00:29:30.36 --> 00:29:34.60
when you are talking about the 90s or now you're, what's, what's special forces unit,

268
00:29:34.60 --> 00:29:38.84
just checking to you when you got done with special forces group? Fifth special forces group,

269
00:29:38.84 --> 00:29:46.20
Fort Campbell Kentucky. And then you were doing lots of J-sets, had no receipts, build these relationships,

270
00:29:46.44 --> 00:29:51.16
filling some of the gaps that were left by the downsizing conventional forces. And what was your,

271
00:29:51.16 --> 00:29:56.28
what was your, did you do, uh, platoon command? Did you do a team? Did you do a company command? Like,

272
00:29:56.28 --> 00:30:03.08
what was your bill it's there? So I was a detachment commander, ODA 582 and third battalion, fifth group.

273
00:30:03.08 --> 00:30:09.56
Um, and were you guys doing, like, regular deployments? Would you go on deployment? So,

274
00:30:09.56 --> 00:30:15.000
yeah, when in the 90s when I was in the SEAL teams, we would go on a six month deployment. Maybe

275
00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:20.44
we'd go to Asia, maybe we'd go to Southwest Asia, maybe we'd go on a ship, but you were doing

276
00:30:20.44 --> 00:30:25.000
a workup and you were going on a long deployment. Were you guys on the schedule like that? Exactly

277
00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:31.08
like that, exactly like that. But with fifth group, I went to one of two places. It was either

278
00:30:31.08 --> 00:30:42.04
Eastern Africa, normally Kenya, or it was in the Middle East, you know, and we had, um, you know,

279
00:30:42.60 --> 00:30:53.48
Kuwait, UAE, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, you know, those places. Yeah, yeah, we must across paths

280
00:30:53.48 --> 00:30:59.96
at some point along the way. We had to, we were at the drive exit. I did a bunch of shipboard deployments

281
00:30:59.96 --> 00:31:04.52
in the 90s and, and one where I wasn't on board a ship, but yeah, we were constantly pulling into

282
00:31:04.52 --> 00:31:10.84
all those places and doing whatever kind of exercises, um, just always, always over there.

283
00:31:10.84 --> 00:31:18.20
One of the, uh, one of the interesting deployments that we went on that I thought was, was really,

284
00:31:18.20 --> 00:31:27.64
really good to work on your trade craft was, um, JTF Bravo. The drug-interdiction missions that we did

285
00:31:27.64 --> 00:31:34.12
on the southern border, and we would, uh, we would deploy for 120 days to the southern border,

286
00:31:34.12 --> 00:31:41.32
and we worked from the Texas border to the New Mexico border, Arizona, and California, and we

287
00:31:41.32 --> 00:31:47.80
culminated in California and the Cleveland National Forest, searching for marijuana fields, and,

288
00:31:47.80 --> 00:31:55.64
and getting scared to death by booby tracks, right, because they, they were everywhere, uh, and,

289
00:31:55.64 --> 00:32:01.64
we would track somebody and then we'd find out they're actually tracking us, you know, so it was like,

290
00:32:01.64 --> 00:32:07.80
holy crap, right, in America. They don't want to mean, uh, and so, but we would get into our

291
00:32:07.80 --> 00:32:15.16
spider holes and we would, you know, we would, you know, I mean, we would practice, um, uh, I remember

292
00:32:15.16 --> 00:32:22.20
given my baton commander briefing, you know, saying, hey, uh, we're gonna, we're gonna be in these

293
00:32:22.20 --> 00:32:27.48
holes, guys are gonna be in the holes for, uh, 72 hours, and then we're gonna, under the covered

294
00:32:27.48 --> 00:32:33.96
darkness rotate them out, get them back to the, um, to our, you know, mission support site, yet a

295
00:32:33.96 --> 00:32:39.08
debrief, and then we're gonna send them back to Phoenix to recover in a wholesale, right,

296
00:32:39.96 --> 00:32:47.40
clean all their kit, and we, we had this whole process, and we're gonna be, we, we made our spider

297
00:32:47.40 --> 00:32:53.96
holes and all our camouflage out of, uh, PVC pipes and all that stuff, right, and we break it all

298
00:32:53.96 --> 00:32:57.96
down, you putting your pack and then you'd set it all up and you dig your hole, and that's what

299
00:32:57.96 --> 00:33:02.44
you're gonna be in, right, and we, we even came up with, you know, different exercises and the

300
00:33:02.44 --> 00:33:07.56
spike, because it couldn't get out of spider holes, right, and so he goes, so what are you gonna do with

301
00:33:07.56 --> 00:33:13.96
the, uh, human waste? Well, we're gonna carry it out with us, and he goes, oh, you're gonna

302
00:33:13.96 --> 00:33:19.08
carry it out, and I said, yeah, we're gonna carry it out with us, sorry, and he goes, I'd like to see that.

303
00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:28.52
So I delivered to him, a hefty bag full of extra meant pee, and I put it right on his desk,

304
00:33:28.52 --> 00:33:33.40
and I said, there it is, sir. I'll never forget to look around his face,

305
00:33:35.72 --> 00:33:39.40
the sergeant made your command, sir, made your pull me aside and he said, that was either

306
00:33:39.40 --> 00:33:45.96
the most brilliant thing that you ever did as a detachment commander or the dumbest thing,

307
00:33:46.68 --> 00:33:47.56
time will tell.

308
00:33:49.56 --> 00:33:56.84
Yeah, that's, oh, that's good. As soon as you said, I'd like to see that. I said, oh, he didn't, oh, yes, he did,

309
00:33:56.84 --> 00:34:02.20
he did, yeah. So, uh, yeah, those were interesting, I never did those missions, but I remember

310
00:34:02.20 --> 00:34:07.000
Platoon's getting sent out to do him, and it's basically doing reconnaissance of drug transport routes

311
00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:11.72
coming across the border, across this other border. We would, we would radio it into the police,

312
00:34:11.72 --> 00:34:18.04
and they would do the introduction, and it was just, it was just a great mission, because we knew

313
00:34:18.04 --> 00:34:25.72
we were doing something for our country, and then we knew we were also training the hell out of ourselves

314
00:34:25.72 --> 00:34:34.60
with these, you know, special reconnaissance techniques that, hey, if they see it, they compromise

315
00:34:34.60 --> 00:34:40.92
it, you're done. So, I mean, it was good. So, where were you when September 11th happened?

316
00:34:42.12 --> 00:34:48.12
I was the operations officer for 3rd Battalion or a 2nd Battalion, fit Special Forces group,

317
00:34:49.64 --> 00:34:58.20
and we were getting ready to go to Jordan for what was the largest

318
00:34:58.20 --> 00:35:08.44
sock, you know, Special Operations Command, Sent Com, Joint Chiefs of Staff missions.

319
00:35:08.44 --> 00:35:13.64
They basically took about 5 Joint Chiefs of Staff missions and combined them all.

320
00:35:14.36 --> 00:35:20.04
We were going to be headquartered in Jordan and it include Egypt, Oman, UAE, Kuwait,

321
00:35:22.12 --> 00:35:26.36
and it was all over that geographic area. We're going to be doing all kinds of decentralized

322
00:35:26.36 --> 00:35:33.16
missions and stuff in these countries, and airborne operations, and we had a, we had a Ranger company

323
00:35:33.16 --> 00:35:39.000
with us, and it was awesome, right? We put this all together. First time they were ever going to

324
00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:44.36
do something like that, and I really liked it because it was a regional approach to solving problems,

325
00:35:44.36 --> 00:35:49.16
right, instead of a country by country for the focus, so it was really great. And I'm a big,

326
00:35:49.16 --> 00:35:53.64
big believer in this, you know, regional thing. I think it works out better when people get together

327
00:35:53.64 --> 00:35:57.88
and try and help each other solve each other's problems as opposed to just focusing the

328
00:35:57.88 --> 00:36:04.20
one country at a time. Anyways, I don't want to digress. So we were getting ready to go over for

329
00:36:04.20 --> 00:36:09.56
that mission. I'm sitting in my office the day before we're getting ready to deploy in 9-11 hits,

330
00:36:09.56 --> 00:36:14.04
right, and I go down the hallway to my boss's office and I put on the television and I go

331
00:36:14.04 --> 00:36:20.36
search this out. By the time I turn it on, the second plane hit hit, you know, and I said,

332
00:36:20.36 --> 00:36:26.52
so I think we're under attack. And I said, it looks like they're going to hit every single one of

333
00:36:26.52 --> 00:36:33.56
our national elements of power. And you know, then Pentagon gets hit, you know, and then the plane

334
00:36:33.56 --> 00:36:39.64
goes down in Pennsylvania, obviously headed probably towards the Capitol or wherever that was

335
00:36:39.64 --> 00:36:44.68
heading. So they, you know, they hit the economic, they just hit the military, they're on their

336
00:36:44.68 --> 00:36:52.04
way to the political, you know, I mean, holy crap. President of the United States canceled every

337
00:36:52.04 --> 00:37:01.40
single exercise except for the Jordan exercise. Because it was so important to the King of Jordan

338
00:37:01.40 --> 00:37:08.60
to have this thing, to have this exercise because it was, he was the hub country, right? And so

339
00:37:08.60 --> 00:37:16.52
we deployed and we did it. And it was shortened from 45 days to 30 days. And that's, you know,

340
00:37:16.52 --> 00:37:25.56
we went directly from Jordan to Uzbekistan for mission planning and then into, uh, into

341
00:37:25.56 --> 00:37:31.72
Terran County, Afghanistan. So because so you complete this training operation in Jordan,

342
00:37:31.72 --> 00:37:36.04
which must have been strange doing this free-contraining operation when the, you know that the

343
00:37:36.04 --> 00:37:40.92
world is like a ticking time bomb. Right. It was. It was. We're watching the news all the time.

344
00:37:40.92 --> 00:37:47.08
And, you know, we're, I'm actually getting messages from higher headquarters, get ready, you're

345
00:37:47.08 --> 00:37:51.88
going to go, you're going to leave. So we got the log guys and ops guys and everybody planning to

346
00:37:51.88 --> 00:38:01.48
move us from Jordan to Uzbekistan. But at the same time, we have 560,000 moving parts for this

347
00:38:01.48 --> 00:38:10.52
5 country operation and people doing airborne operations, live fires, you know, CQB, you know,

348
00:38:10.52 --> 00:38:15.56
I mean, just all kinds of high-adventure training, right? And, you know, we're doing

349
00:38:17.72 --> 00:38:24.44
joint and combined airborne operations. So you got, picture this. You got Americans,

350
00:38:24.44 --> 00:38:30.84
Jordanians, and Egyptians on the same plane, getting ready to jump out. Yihah, right?

351
00:38:30.84 --> 00:38:36.76
Because, you know, as far as I'm concerned, that's a, you know, I mean, we trained them, but they

352
00:38:36.76 --> 00:38:42.36
not necessarily follow on our training, you know? And the way some of them exit the aircraft was like,

353
00:38:42.36 --> 00:38:49.80
oh, we're crap. Are you kidding me? So it was like, you know, a lot of the sirens are looking at me

354
00:38:49.80 --> 00:38:56.04
going, you're killing me, sir, you know? Like, okay. Yeah, we're not. That's not the intent, right?

355
00:38:56.04 --> 00:39:02.12
But, I'm like, hey, we got to do this, right? I mean, that's what it is. And they would, they would make

356
00:39:02.12 --> 00:39:07.56
sure it was great. And it went off without a hitch, but. So then from there, you go to Uzbekistan?

357
00:39:07.56 --> 00:39:13.000
Uzbekistan. And now, are you guys getting, you guys got the tasking, okay, you're going to

358
00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:17.16
Afghanistan? Go to, as go to Uzbekistan to start planning. Right, because that's how many guys?

359
00:39:18.44 --> 00:39:25.08
It was, let me see, you know, 15 of us. And Colonel Fox had to pick him.

360
00:39:25.08 --> 00:39:31.08
So he picked him 15 of us went off. And then he turned over the battalion to the Exo.

361
00:39:31.64 --> 00:39:40.60
And the Exo stayed in place and enjoyed. And then slow but surely he would rotate the teams

362
00:39:40.60 --> 00:39:47.72
into Uzbekistan. Has space opened up. So what you get to Uzbekistan? I mean, what's the

363
00:39:47.72 --> 00:39:54.92
damn, what's the atmosphere with the team? How much do you guys know about Afghanistan prior to this? Nothing.

364
00:39:55.56 --> 00:40:01.80
Nothing. Absolutely. Did you learn a language as a special force officer? I did. I learned Egyptian

365
00:40:01.80 --> 00:40:08.68
Arabic. Okay. Now, I passed the language test. Uh-huh. But we're not going to school.

366
00:40:08.68 --> 00:40:14.76
Egyptian quiz show or anything. Yeah. With the lowest score of that you could get on the defense

367
00:40:14.76 --> 00:40:22.52
language aptitude, battery test. Apparently, God didn't give me the ability to learn foreign languages.

368
00:40:23.32 --> 00:40:28.12
And I did. I struggled through what Spanish and high school in college, but I struggled through it.

369
00:40:28.12 --> 00:40:36.36
I got through it anyways. But nonetheless, um, so the lowest score qualifies me for a romantic language,

370
00:40:36.36 --> 00:40:41.48
like French and Spanish and Italian. And what did they send me to? Fifth Special Forces group

371
00:40:41.48 --> 00:40:47.96
with a language as Egyptian Arabic category, four language. And I'm like, really? You want me to fail?

372
00:40:47.96 --> 00:40:53.64
Is that it? Uh, but, you know, like anything else, test scores, you know, they mean something,

373
00:40:53.64 --> 00:41:02.20
but they don't test. They don't test your will to do your best, right? So I ended up graduating with a

374
00:41:02.20 --> 00:41:11.000
two plus two plus and got language pay at $75 a month. Uh-huh. And um, and I was just, you know,

375
00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:16.04
I called two plus two plus just being dangerous enough to, uh, you know, use a foreign language.

376
00:41:16.04 --> 00:41:21.48
You know, it's, it's like, it's like being a first level black belt in martial arts, right?

377
00:41:21.48 --> 00:41:27.96
You're just danger enough to get yourself hurt. But it looks cool, right? Uh, but nonetheless,

378
00:41:27.96 --> 00:41:37.32
it is what it is. And I, um, uh, yeah, I, I, I did that, but the Egyptian Arabic does you absolutely

379
00:41:37.32 --> 00:41:45.64
know good in Afghanistan, with posh to and urdu and, you know, Tajik and Uzbek. And, you know,

380
00:41:46.76 --> 00:41:51.16
so your news about Uzbekistan, you're coming up with a plan and, and, and,

381
00:41:52.20 --> 00:41:55.96
who's given you direction at this point? What are you guys getting for a mission tasking? Are you

382
00:41:55.96 --> 00:42:02.84
getting clear directives or is it more, hey, go, go start to put something together?

383
00:42:02.84 --> 00:42:08.44
So to the credit of our seniors, everything was moving so fast and everything was coming out of the

384
00:42:08.44 --> 00:42:15.16
Pentagon and the National Command Authority so quickly, so rapidly, uh, that, you know, we weren't

385
00:42:15.16 --> 00:42:25.000
getting anything, right? And so, um, basically, we had two teams and then a command and control element,

386
00:42:27.24 --> 00:42:31.40
that had to be led by Lieutenant Colonel and that came directly from the Secretary of

387
00:42:31.40 --> 00:42:38.44
Defense. So, so it's not even the standard way that we would deploy into it theater of operations.

388
00:42:38.44 --> 00:42:44.28
So you got two teams with a battalion commander and a very small staff that were

389
00:42:44.28 --> 00:42:54.68
C2. Now, third battalion had the north, second battalion had the south and first battalion had,

390
00:42:54.68 --> 00:43:03.88
you know, the, um, the Kabul Bagram area. Um, and so when we got there, it was like, all right,

391
00:43:03.88 --> 00:43:07.96
you got the south, you got to go link up with the armored cars, you got these two teams,

392
00:43:07.96 --> 00:43:11.08
one's going to come from the south, one's going to come from the north, and figure it out.

393
00:43:11.72 --> 00:43:15.24
So we did. And I was happy to figure it out because it was good. How do you guys get in?

394
00:43:15.24 --> 00:43:27.16
So we went, uh, MH1, uh, excuse me, MC130s, uh, to Jakobabad, Pakistan. And this, this is really,

395
00:43:27.16 --> 00:43:31.64
it's really funny because we were told, okay, you're going to get there and you're going to

396
00:43:31.64 --> 00:43:37.80
go find the special ops Air Force unit. And they're the ones that are going to fly you in

397
00:43:37.80 --> 00:43:45.96
to Tarantown, Afghanistan, where you'll link up with a group of Afghans, and then they'll take

398
00:43:45.96 --> 00:43:51.48
you to harm it cars. I. So that's, so that was the plan. That was the plan. That was the plan.

399
00:43:51.48 --> 00:43:56.36
And where did I find the Air Force guys in the mess hall? Because I looked all around,

400
00:43:56.36 --> 00:44:00.60
Jakobabad, and I'd warm, right? And my boss is like, I go, sir, let's go to the mess hall.

401
00:44:01.16 --> 00:44:06.12
Good call. And so there they were, they were in the mess hall. And so, you know,

402
00:44:06.12 --> 00:44:11.64
and where they bring you up in? Like, pay blows or something? Yes. Yeah, that's exactly at MH53s.

403
00:44:11.64 --> 00:44:17.80
We went right in. We took fire going in. One of them was hit. They still brought us in.

404
00:44:17.80 --> 00:44:24.36
We did a, what I like to call a controlled crash landing. I mean, it was a hard landing. We all fell

405
00:44:24.36 --> 00:44:30.36
all over the place inside the damn thing. We jump out. The one advantage we had was nice night vision

406
00:44:30.36 --> 00:44:37.000
goggles. We didn't know where they were or who they were. But I had worked on. I had worked on

407
00:44:37.88 --> 00:44:48.04
one posh tune sentence. Please take us to harm it cars like. I worked on that over and over and over again.

408
00:44:48.84 --> 00:44:56.84
And we land, we hit the ground, dust everywhere, takes a few minutes for the dust to settle.

409
00:44:56.84 --> 00:45:04.20
We get into a V formation. And the plan that we had was, I go Colonel Fox, I go Sir,

410
00:45:05.16 --> 00:45:12.12
move forward. Once we see him, we'll set in security. I'll walk forward with my rehearsed sentence.

411
00:45:12.84 --> 00:45:18.60
And, you know, we'll go from there. You guys point your weapons. I'm not going to point my weapon

412
00:45:18.60 --> 00:45:23.80
at him, but I'm going to have it at the ready just in case I need it. And I can see him. They're all,

413
00:45:23.80 --> 00:45:28.36
all these have. There's about 10 Afghans there. And they're all point in their weapons at me. And I'm

414
00:45:28.36 --> 00:45:36.52
walking up and I look at him. And I got these AK47s right in my face. And all I could come out with was

415
00:45:36.52 --> 00:45:45.08
harm it cars. That's the only thing I could say. That lower her sentence gone gone. And they,

416
00:45:46.68 --> 00:45:52.36
you know, gave me the, you know, good, good to go. And, you know, I called up the guys. We came up.

417
00:45:52.36 --> 00:45:58.04
They put us in trucks. And 20 minutes later, we were meeting on the cars. I, in a mud hut.

418
00:45:58.04 --> 00:46:03.000
And then we started doing mud hut diplomacy. So what's mud hut diplomacy look like?

419
00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:09.96
It looks like a bunch of Afghans sitting on the ground with us in front of a map. And we're telling

420
00:46:09.96 --> 00:46:15.64
them, you know, what we're seeing from our aircraft and the sky. And are they bad guys? Are they

421
00:46:15.64 --> 00:46:21.40
good guys? And then we're coming up with intermediate places on the ground to go to. And our first

422
00:46:21.40 --> 00:46:36.12
convoy that we did this was a disaster. Little did we know that that they would all huddle around

423
00:46:36.12 --> 00:46:40.52
carsized vehicle because they didn't want anything to happen to them. And we had cars I in the

424
00:46:40.52 --> 00:46:49.56
wrong spot. So we had motorcycles and Toyota carolers and pickup trucks. We lost complete control of

425
00:46:49.56 --> 00:46:57.24
this convoy. And then we stopped to pray. Right in the middle of the operation, right?

426
00:46:57.24 --> 00:47:01.72
Is this really a safe place to stop and pray? But it didn't matter. It's time to pray. We're going to

427
00:47:01.72 --> 00:47:08.12
pray. So we did that. So what we did was we figured out on the next one that we would put

428
00:47:08.76 --> 00:47:16.20
our guys up front for security. And we put cars I back there. And nobody would pass carsized vehicle.

429
00:47:16.20 --> 00:47:22.28
So we made a control. Now if you turn around and looked at that gaggle back there, it was like,

430
00:47:22.28 --> 00:47:29.16
oh yeah, mad max. Yeah, really that's a great way to explain it. And but it worked. And so that's what

431
00:47:29.16 --> 00:47:36.12
we did. And as we move forward, we got more and more village elders and tribal elders into the

432
00:47:36.12 --> 00:47:40.44
meetings. And then of course, you know, people were talking about security concern. You know,

433
00:47:40.44 --> 00:47:44.36
what if someone comes in and just opens up and sprays the place. And I said, well, it's

434
00:47:44.36 --> 00:47:49.96
a chance we have to take. I mean, it's just part of the part of the operational environment.

435
00:47:49.96 --> 00:47:55.80
Yeah, you can't mitigate all risks. You can't do your best. But there's going to be some risks

436
00:47:55.80 --> 00:47:59.40
that you're going to have to take to achieve your mission. And they weren't in the mood for us to

437
00:47:59.40 --> 00:48:03.48
disarm them. They weren't in the mood for us to search them. They weren't in the mood for any of that.

438
00:48:03.48 --> 00:48:09.56
Right. We had to prove ourselves to them. And then they had to get comfortable with us. And we just

439
00:48:09.56 --> 00:48:16.52
had to trust, you know, cars eye. And trust me, the CIA guys that were there with cars eye were just as

440
00:48:16.52 --> 00:48:22.68
nervous as we were, just as concerned as we were. Because the last thing we wanted was cars eye to

441
00:48:22.68 --> 00:48:32.76
get hurt because he's on the phone with all of the news outlets. Right. In the middle of a briefing,

442
00:48:32.76 --> 00:48:41.56
we'd get a call. Hey, you know, you know, whatever his name is Dan Rather, or whoever wanted

443
00:48:41.56 --> 00:48:46.28
to talk to him. Right. And so he would take an interview right there. And then you had the bond

444
00:48:46.28 --> 00:48:51.40
committee that was meeting to figure out, you know, the government who's going to be the interim

445
00:48:51.40 --> 00:48:55.96
prime minister. And of course, cars eye at the top of the list, they want to talk to them. So in the

446
00:48:55.96 --> 00:48:59.96
middle of that, they call up. And they want to talk to them about stuff. And, you know, he just

447
00:48:59.96 --> 00:49:07.40
just sit there and listen to it. He was really good. He was really good in those days. He did a

448
00:49:07.40 --> 00:49:17.32
really, really good job. And I had a lot of hope, right. But, you know, things get politicized and things

449
00:49:17.32 --> 00:49:25.56
happen. And, you know, the longer things, you know, go on. He just, he just, you know, I really

450
00:49:25.56 --> 00:49:33.000
thought he did a great job, particularly at the beginning there. And, you know, the way he managed

451
00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:39.64
risk and the way he made decisions and the way he handled and the respect that he got, he was

452
00:49:39.64 --> 00:49:49.000
the right guy at the time, right. And so it was just a very, very interesting to see that.

453
00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:56.60
And, of course, in subsequent deployments, I had a personal relationship with cars eye. So I could

454
00:49:56.60 --> 00:50:04.04
leverage that pretty easily as a result of that very first rotation to explain something that

455
00:50:05.16 --> 00:50:13.88
had looked like in Kabul, had gone wrong. But there was a lot of things in between where it happened,

456
00:50:13.88 --> 00:50:19.88
and what was being told, and what was being put out by the Taliban that weren't true. And I was

457
00:50:19.88 --> 00:50:26.68
able to get communications to him to be able to say, hey, that's not the way it went down. Sir,

458
00:50:26.68 --> 00:50:31.16
please, please understand that my heart's in a right place. And he would.

459
00:50:31.16 --> 00:50:39.96
Now, speaking of things going wrong, once you involved in a, you know, a fractur side of incident

460
00:50:39.96 --> 00:50:46.12
where a bomb was dropped onto your location. Can you give me a brief of us on that one?

461
00:50:46.12 --> 00:51:00.12
Yeah, I, I blame myself for that one a day. So we were at Shawwallycott, 20 kilometers north of

462
00:51:00.12 --> 00:51:04.92
Candehara, which was our, our operational objective. We had to take Candehara from the Taliban.

463
00:51:04.92 --> 00:51:11.08
The religious center of gravity. It was more important to take Candehara than it really was

464
00:51:11.08 --> 00:51:18.92
to own Kabul or Harat or MES, you know, Majar Sharif, because of the significance of it.

465
00:51:18.92 --> 00:51:25.64
And we had one presidential mission. And that was to determine whether the cloak of Muhammad

466
00:51:25.64 --> 00:51:34.52
in the mosque in Candehara was still there because it was a huge concern in the, in the Muslim community.

467
00:51:34.52 --> 00:51:38.68
All, you know, all the way back to Mecca, right, with Saudi Arabia. I mean, this was a big deal.

468
00:51:40.12 --> 00:51:49.08
And so, you know, we, we were doing combat operations for three days north of here. I mean,

469
00:51:49.08 --> 00:51:54.68
we had to go through a pass in this pass at high ground, it was a bridge. It was a, it was a,

470
00:51:54.68 --> 00:52:01.24
it was a, tortured front and it was very well defended by the Taliban and al-Qaeda. And they

471
00:52:01.24 --> 00:52:07.96
weren't given this ground up very easily. And we were doing combat operations, leading patrols,

472
00:52:08.76 --> 00:52:14.12
trying to disrupt them. We were, we were engaging them with, you know,

473
00:52:16.52 --> 00:52:22.28
you know, F-15s and so on, so forth. And it was going pretty, you know, it was going real well.

474
00:52:22.28 --> 00:52:27.24
And we were getting people that were switching sides, you know, Afghans that were coming

475
00:52:27.24 --> 00:52:32.84
on the side and they were given us great intel on stuff, which is always shocking for Americans to

476
00:52:32.84 --> 00:52:40.28
hear about people switching sides. And it's very common, especially in the Arab culture.

477
00:52:40.28 --> 00:52:45.72
And I know that there's a, I want to say this is an Osama bin Laden quote that, you know,

478
00:52:45.72 --> 00:52:49.72
the, the people are going to bet on the winning horse. So basically, if you're strong and you're

479
00:52:49.72 --> 00:52:53.32
winning people were like, okay, that's who we're putting our money on. And so this was what you were

480
00:52:53.32 --> 00:53:00.36
seeing on the ground was as the coalition grew and as cars I got more people, people are looking

481
00:53:00.36 --> 00:53:05.40
around going, he's got more people. And they, it's almost like a mob mentality of joining, joining

482
00:53:05.40 --> 00:53:11.24
that team. Oh, absolutely, and absolutely. And, you know, required flexibility and adaptability

483
00:53:11.24 --> 00:53:16.28
on our part. And I know, I know Colonel Fox was just never real comfortable with it. All right,

484
00:53:16.28 --> 00:53:21.56
Don, where did all these people come from? And I said, well, sir, they came, they came from overnight.

485
00:53:21.56 --> 00:53:26.44
And they came from over there. And he goes, these guys were fighting us. And I go, oh, yeah,

486
00:53:26.44 --> 00:53:31.80
they were fighting us. And now they're with us. And we got the, you know, they're all vouched for

487
00:53:31.80 --> 00:53:36.84
because, you know, all this is my cousin. This is my brother. This is my, you know, and so hey,

488
00:53:36.84 --> 00:53:40.76
all right. And, you know, we got the Sard and Major telling us, you know, it's okay. And then we got,

489
00:53:41.40 --> 00:53:44.92
you know, Elvis going, thank you very much. Thank you very much, you know. So he, you know,

490
00:53:47.16 --> 00:53:50.44
and he goes, and we're going to arm him and give him bullets and everything. And I said, well,

491
00:53:50.44 --> 00:53:58.04
yes, there we are. And he goes, oh, Jesus. So he was never really quite comfortable with it.

492
00:53:58.68 --> 00:54:04.04
And he goes, he goes, you're, you're good with this. And I said, hey, sir, but I don't know if we have a choice

493
00:54:04.04 --> 00:54:11.24
number one. But yeah, I'm good with it. You know, I grew up in a small town in New Hampshire. And I can

494
00:54:11.24 --> 00:54:17.88
see the same thing happening there, you know, people sitting on the fence, you know, historically,

495
00:54:17.88 --> 00:54:23.48
we've seen that, you know, where the passive people start joining the people that are winning. And,

496
00:54:23.48 --> 00:54:28.60
you know, before that, they're passive and now they're active and, you know, vice versa. So,

497
00:54:30.84 --> 00:54:37.24
yeah, I think, I think we'll be okay, right. And, uh, it's all right. I'm coming for you, though,

498
00:54:37.24 --> 00:54:45.24
if you're wrong. I said, all right. That's fair. That's fair. So anyways, we, we're doing this,

499
00:54:45.24 --> 00:54:50.76
and it's about 830 in the morning, and we get some good intel, and, you know, we get with cars

500
00:54:50.76 --> 00:54:58.20
eye and we get a good decision from him, and we start, um, we start our operations up. Well,

501
00:54:58.20 --> 00:55:07.08
we had a very, very good process for clearing our fires. We had a great STS guy on the ground.

502
00:55:07.72 --> 00:55:14.20
And we have absolutely no errors. And we, we needed to build up our four structure going into

503
00:55:14.20 --> 00:55:23.000
F, going into Candahar. So, we took this point, we took this point time to bring in some

504
00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:31.48
additional, uh, augmenties, right. And it was about 24 hours before this had happened. So, what we did was,

505
00:55:33.96 --> 00:55:41.56
we, um, we did a good transition with everybody. We had a tack pee come in and he did

506
00:55:41.56 --> 00:55:48.44
good transition with the STS and learned all the SOPs and everything like that. And RSDS guy in the

507
00:55:48.44 --> 00:55:54.44
tack pee had, uh, changed over. So just so everyone knows these, these are the guys that

508
00:55:55.24 --> 00:56:00.44
call for fire from the air. That's where it talks about. And the tack pee in the STS, these are

509
00:56:00.44 --> 00:56:05.80
individuals that are trained. That's what they do. It's, I mean, obviously it's a really hard job.

510
00:56:05.80 --> 00:56:10.92
One mistake can be deadly, and that's what they're focused on, and it's great to have those guys,

511
00:56:10.92 --> 00:56:15.40
because that's what they do for a living. Right. And so you had a transition taking place where you're

512
00:56:15.40 --> 00:56:20.36
going from one guy that had been with you. Now your, your force is glowing. You got some extra guys

513
00:56:20.36 --> 00:56:25.96
that are going to be able to help out, but they're just showing up. So they're not quite up to,

514
00:56:25.96 --> 00:56:33.96
to up the speed yet. That's correct. That's correct. And, um, and so they did their transition.

515
00:56:33.96 --> 00:56:41.16
And we had got a mail in for the first time. So guys were, you know, guys that weren't directly

516
00:56:41.16 --> 00:56:47.56
involved in doing anything were opening up their mail. And, you know, I had done a walk around

517
00:56:47.56 --> 00:56:57.80
our defense of area, which was an old Soviet mortar pit right up in the high ground. And I had

518
00:56:57.80 --> 00:57:05.80
walked around and I had gone down the hill, just got to the bottom of the hill and this big explosion.

519
00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:15.64
I don't know where. And, um, I don't know how much time had passed to be honest with you,

520
00:57:15.64 --> 00:57:23.72
but I picked myself up off the ground. I had pieces of body parts, stuff all over me,

521
00:57:23.72 --> 00:57:30.84
blood all over me. I'm doing a quick assessment of myself. I got a real bad injury with my leg.

522
00:57:32.68 --> 00:57:40.20
And, um, you know, days looking around and it is utter mayhem.

523
00:57:42.04 --> 00:57:50.84
We got Afghans down, we got Americans down, we got rounds, cooking off, we got RPGs, cooking off,

524
00:57:50.84 --> 00:58:00.20
it's going all over the place. I start walking around, I start grabbing our guys. We go down to

525
00:58:00.20 --> 00:58:06.12
where Karzai was and we made sure he was okay and he was with his CIA guys and they had secured him.

526
00:58:08.76 --> 00:58:15.40
And the guys that were with him, securing him, I asked them if they would go out and reconnaissance

527
00:58:15.40 --> 00:58:21.08
and they placed the bringing helicopters because I knew we were going to have to cast a vac here.

528
00:58:21.08 --> 00:58:30.92
And, out 200 meters we had casualties, right? It was a mess. All 20 of the U.S. guys on the ground

529
00:58:30.92 --> 00:58:44.44
were injured some way or another, some more than others. And, we had designated a casualty control point

530
00:58:44.44 --> 00:58:55.000
and I got with my cons guys and we had to find some, we had to kind of like, take cons equipment from,

531
00:58:55.000 --> 00:59:00.12
you know, cannibalize it from other stuff to make the reestablished communications with higher

532
00:59:00.12 --> 00:59:09.08
headquarters. I found Colonel Fox and he was, he was dazed and confused just to the point where

533
00:59:09.08 --> 00:59:14.36
he was just not coherent about what was going on so made sure that he was taking care of.

534
00:59:15.96 --> 00:59:22.36
And, I went up on the hill and we started pulling bodies off, right? All these rounds

535
00:59:22.36 --> 00:59:25.96
cooking off and everything like getting guys off to top of the hill, getting him down.

536
00:59:27.72 --> 00:59:35.000
And we knew we had to get complete accountability of everybody.

537
00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:44.92
And, we did that and I was missing one, right? And, I went back up on the hill to where his position was

538
00:59:44.92 --> 00:59:53.80
and that was ground zero with the impact of the 2000 pound bomb from a B-52 of 35,000 feet.

539
00:59:53.80 --> 01:00:06.52
And, I searched everywhere and I found his hat and I took his hat and I started picking up

540
01:00:09.16 --> 01:00:15.000
bits and pieces and I put it inside the hat and I put the hat inside a bag and I marked it

541
01:00:15.56 --> 01:00:22.04
and that's how he was identified. But there was nothing to send home, absolutely nothing to send home.

542
01:00:22.04 --> 01:00:29.72
And, another one of our guys that was killed was completely torn in half. I found him under a vehicle.

543
01:00:30.60 --> 01:00:37.24
His chest was still heaving, his legs were over here, his chest, his body was separated from it.

544
01:00:38.44 --> 01:00:45.16
And, I started doing CPR on him and someone finally grabs me on the shoulders and goes, sir.

545
01:00:45.16 --> 01:00:56.12
No, it's not going to work. He's torn in half. So, anyways, we'd get him in a body bag and we

546
01:00:56.68 --> 01:01:04.04
get him off there and then we had one guy that was not going to make it, but was still alive and we kept

547
01:01:04.04 --> 01:01:15.08
him alive and we got him EVAC when we had coordinated EVAC and we got a B-Team special force

548
01:01:15.08 --> 01:01:22.92
this company and an ODA to come into back fill. That came in from higher headquarters. We got all the guys out

549
01:01:23.72 --> 01:01:32.84
and then we started doing the after action in regrouping because we still had this was five December.

550
01:01:32.84 --> 01:01:46.04
We still had to go and take Kandahar. So, me, my assistant S3, the batang commander and a comical guy

551
01:01:46.68 --> 01:01:52.52
despite our injuries we stayed on the ground in order to be able to coordinate the push to Kandahar.

552
01:01:53.56 --> 01:01:58.44
So, we did that. We regrouped. We got as many afghans out as we possibly could that were injured.

553
01:01:58.44 --> 01:02:05.88
That wasn't something that higher wanted to do but we talked them into doing it because it was

554
01:02:05.88 --> 01:02:13.08
the right thing to do. So, we got our afghans partners, we backed out. We helped with the casualties

555
01:02:13.08 --> 01:02:19.88
for them as well in the village and everybody came out and helped from the different areas around the village.

556
01:02:19.88 --> 01:02:33.64
We just said screw it. We're going to hit that bridge. We're going to hit that pass and

557
01:02:34.36 --> 01:02:38.84
we're going to knock them out of there and we went through. Nobody was there.

558
01:02:41.64 --> 01:02:47.24
This was eight December and we went right into Kandahar and we took Kandahar and

559
01:02:47.24 --> 01:02:56.36
the after action on that though. I blame myself to this day. Transition between the STS and the

560
01:02:56.36 --> 01:03:07.40
tech P was really good but the tech P had to change batteries and those old soft lamps that we used

561
01:03:07.40 --> 01:03:14.68
to target designate. When you do that the grid resets to your position. So, before you send

562
01:03:14.68 --> 01:03:21.48
anything or confirm anything with the aircraft you've got to make sure that you have your grid

563
01:03:21.48 --> 01:03:30.28
system squared away and that was the mistake that was made. As I go over this in my mind over

564
01:03:30.28 --> 01:03:34.84
an older and older and older, you get even to this day I think to myself. I should have been there

565
01:03:34.84 --> 01:03:48.04
to make sure that I should have got an in person briefing from the tech P that he knew all those

566
01:03:48.04 --> 01:03:54.36
procedures. I should have got that and I didn't get that and because I didn't get it,

567
01:03:55.16 --> 01:03:59.64
because of we're in combat and because of all the things that you talked about earlier.

568
01:03:59.64 --> 01:04:08.52
You know, the mistake was made and I was in charge of those operations on behalf of Colonel Fox.

569
01:04:08.52 --> 01:04:14.60
I was my job and I didn't do my job in my opinion to the best of my ability and we had that event

570
01:04:14.60 --> 01:04:29.16
occur and I learned a big lesson and I'm sure a lot of people were in a big lesson but at the end of the day,

571
01:04:29.80 --> 01:04:35.08
there's a, and I think you talk about it and you're booked there at extreme ownership

572
01:04:35.08 --> 01:04:41.96
the fog of war and and clause widths and his explanation of the fog of war and I mean it's all there

573
01:04:41.96 --> 01:04:49.56
right and you do what you can do in some cases you can only do so much there's a lot of things going on

574
01:04:50.36 --> 01:04:56.20
but in retrospect it becomes clearer and as you say you got to take extreme ownership

575
01:04:57.80 --> 01:05:01.80
not only on those things that go well but most importantly on those things that don't go well

576
01:05:03.32 --> 01:05:06.84
at what point did you realize it was a the friendly bomb?

577
01:05:06.84 --> 01:05:21.96
Well, it wasn't until I was talking to the tack P who was seriously injured and he was apologizing

578
01:05:23.96 --> 01:05:33.08
and he said I said I made a mistake I don't think that I I cleared that grid like I was supposed to do

579
01:05:33.08 --> 01:05:43.48
and I said hey listen mistakes happen these things happen please you need you need to

580
01:05:44.28 --> 01:05:50.12
focus on keeping yourself I mean he was seriously and you need to focus on keeping self alive

581
01:05:50.12 --> 01:05:57.72
so you can get home to your family these things happen don't blame yourself now I know to this

582
01:05:57.72 --> 01:06:05.56
day because I've spoken to him quite a bit you know the burden that he carries but at the end of the day

583
01:06:11.08 --> 01:06:19.40
fog of war mistakes happen so leadership responsibility but it wasn't until then that I realized

584
01:06:19.40 --> 01:06:29.16
oh crap we got a we got a friendly fire incident here and so when the investigation team came

585
01:06:29.16 --> 01:06:36.20
down to investigate we were already in candle hall and we were already set up but we had already written

586
01:06:36.20 --> 01:06:40.44
our statements and you know I had a pretty good packet form knowing you know anticipating what was

587
01:06:40.44 --> 01:06:45.24
going on and I think you talked about that in your book as well you know one one friendly fire

588
01:06:45.24 --> 01:06:52.68
incident okay let's we know a whole bunch of shit's gonna come rain and down on us so let's get ahead of the

589
01:06:52.68 --> 01:06:59.96
power curve and let's make sure that we find out what went on and we tell the truth and we get the

590
01:06:59.96 --> 01:07:06.12
accurate assessment of what went on and when we came down and and it was Brigadier General Burford

591
01:07:06.68 --> 01:07:14.44
he was the deputy commander for U.S. Special Operations Command he's won the came down and led the

592
01:07:14.44 --> 01:07:20.28
investigation and sat down with his team we said this is what we got we got him out to the spot so we

593
01:07:20.28 --> 01:07:26.44
could see it and you know we gave him we gave him a you know a good briefing on on that and what we

594
01:07:26.44 --> 01:07:32.04
were doing and how we were doing it and we had taken that soft lamb and we had isolated it

595
01:07:32.92 --> 01:07:39.56
it had been damaged but nonetheless wasn't being used anymore and so we had everything for him

596
01:07:39.56 --> 01:07:45.32
and an in a nice rack and and I go hey listen this is a combat environment you know we don't want to

597
01:07:45.32 --> 01:07:50.20
we don't want to have them come down here and have to expose themselves to danger here while they're

598
01:07:50.20 --> 01:07:53.96
doing their investigation but at the same time we want to make sure they get to where they need to go to

599
01:07:53.96 --> 01:08:00.68
do a thorough investigation and and the most important thing is lessons learned so this never

600
01:08:00.68 --> 01:08:08.04
ever happens again right and I tell you what nine more rotations never happen to me again

601
01:08:08.04 --> 01:08:15.16
never happen in the unit that I served in again because we made sure that you know those kind

602
01:08:15.16 --> 01:08:20.84
of lessons were applied and over and over and over again right yeah when I took over the training

603
01:08:20.84 --> 01:08:25.24
for the west coast seal teams like the tactical pre-to-planet training I would put those guys

604
01:08:25.24 --> 01:08:29.88
in positions all the time and they would every single group every single two every single

605
01:08:29.88 --> 01:08:36.36
troop every single task minute they'd get a blue on blue and I'd sit down and say I want this to happen

606
01:08:36.36 --> 01:08:41.80
here so you realize how it happens so it doesn't happen overseas like it did to me so that's

607
01:08:41.80 --> 01:08:46.04
the best thing you can do is take those lessons learned and and spread the word so it doesn't

608
01:08:46.04 --> 01:08:53.80
happen again I can tell you that there's still still guys on that ODA there's there's all three

609
01:08:54.52 --> 01:09:00.68
of the guys that we lost still blame us still blame the chained command from that

610
01:09:00.68 --> 01:09:11.64
right and that's okay I take that responsibility fully I accept it and I understand where they're

611
01:09:11.64 --> 01:09:23.000
coming from and that's just that's hopefully it has made me a better leader right as a result

612
01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:31.08
and what else am I going to do right except acknowledge it and you know move forward because my

613
01:09:31.08 --> 01:09:39.72
responsibilities in leading didn't end as a result of that yeah yeah and I mean even to those

614
01:09:39.72 --> 01:09:46.12
those guys that were lost and God rest their souls but at least they're the lessons that were

615
01:09:46.12 --> 01:09:53.80
learned from that horrible as they may be at least there's you know as you said no operation that

616
01:09:53.80 --> 01:10:00.12
you oversaw after that ever had another incident so their sacrifice saved lives and I know that

617
01:10:00.84 --> 01:10:06.28
horrible in one way but it's the truth it's also the truth it's also the truth and yeah I didn't

618
01:10:06.28 --> 01:10:15.08
never had another blue one blue incident and the as a tying commander as a siege so to fake commander and

619
01:10:15.08 --> 01:10:20.76
as a general officer level commander and Afghanistan and combat never ever had another one and

620
01:10:22.84 --> 01:10:28.92
you know we attribute that to of course the experience of the guys as we go through but most importantly

621
01:10:28.92 --> 01:10:37.88
you know leadership and learning they're indispensable right and so you got to you got to move forward

622
01:10:37.88 --> 01:10:46.68
and that's what we did so so you guys rolling to can to hard and it's pretty much no factor

623
01:10:46.68 --> 01:10:53.40
there's like what was the resistance level rolling to can't are the resistance level was minimal we got

624
01:10:53.40 --> 01:11:03.80
ambushed going in and you know we took care of that and we kept going we get to the Mula Omar's

625
01:11:03.80 --> 01:11:20.44
compound and it is there are vehicles everywhere covered with mud because that's what they did to

626
01:11:20.44 --> 01:11:27.88
try and hide from our aerial observations right they covered their vehicles with mud they saw predator

627
01:11:27.88 --> 01:11:35.16
right so we we said and that was a way for us to identify if they were if they were bad guys are good

628
01:11:35.16 --> 01:11:41.56
guys because the bad guys were covering their cars but here it is again I looked at you I looked at

629
01:11:41.56 --> 01:11:48.60
Colonel Fox and I said hey sir look we're parking lot full of bad guys and now they're on our

630
01:11:48.60 --> 01:11:55.24
side right and he goes I don't get this this is so and then we went to the jail and we brought John

631
01:11:55.24 --> 01:12:00.44
Mohamit that John Mohamit was a very very close friend of Karzai and he had been

632
01:12:00.44 --> 01:12:07.000
imprisoned by the Taliban and tortured for very very long time and he became the governor of

633
01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:13.64
Ervour's gone and he got up there and he met with Karzai and and this is a guy that I developed

634
01:12:13.64 --> 01:12:21.80
a very good friendship with over the years no matter what job I had going back into Afghanistan

635
01:12:21.80 --> 01:12:29.88
in his mind I was the commander of all special forces right I just what's not and I would tell

636
01:12:29.88 --> 01:12:34.36
him I don't hey listen I'm just a baton commander here I just got these guys he goes oh no no no

637
01:12:34.36 --> 01:12:39.16
you are the commander of all special forces and he would tell people that and it would get in the

638
01:12:39.16 --> 01:12:45.64
news right and and I'd get a phone call and I go I didn't tell him that right and so yeah I knew

639
01:12:45.64 --> 01:12:52.92
his guy and you know what he's like a commander of all special well he was he was a wild man always

640
01:12:52.92 --> 01:12:57.96
had been a wild man if there's one guy that you wanted him because or his gun province was you know

641
01:12:57.96 --> 01:13:01.88
I mean it was full of Taliban it was full of okay and we needed to guy like that to go up there

642
01:13:01.88 --> 01:13:08.12
and you know a clean house but the way he was cleaning house in the way that you know it was acceptable

643
01:13:08.12 --> 01:13:14.60
in the international community was two different things and so we had to keep it very close to

644
01:13:14.60 --> 01:13:24.76
I don't that but nonetheless he gets there and he goes all right I'm going to need some furniture

645
01:13:24.76 --> 01:13:30.36
so he starts going in the rooms and he starts going I want that I want that I want that and he goes

646
01:13:30.36 --> 01:13:38.04
into Moola Omar's office and I wasn't with him but one of the guys was in there and he comes

647
01:13:38.04 --> 01:13:43.48
running over to me and he goes sir you got to get over here he goes the guy that we just let out a

648
01:13:43.48 --> 01:13:55.24
jail he's going to the bathroom on top of Moola Omar's desk and I go what and I go in there and he left

649
01:13:55.24 --> 01:14:06.20
a mess on top of that desk and that was his just what he felt he needed to do and then he told

650
01:14:06.20 --> 01:14:11.96
Karzai I'm on my way to Orr's gun province when I get the Tarenk out of Lichko, Lichino and

651
01:14:11.96 --> 01:14:19.24
we'll start clearing that place out and you know Karzai put governors in Orr's gun province is a

652
01:14:19.24 --> 01:14:27.48
bull province for our province, Nimru's province, Helman province, Helman was the one that we got the

653
01:14:27.48 --> 01:14:35.80
largest number of Taliban al-Qaeda and operational Russian equipment out of and we had to negotiate

654
01:14:35.80 --> 01:14:40.76
that right we had to negotiate that with the Taliban leader there that you know he would you know he'd

655
01:14:40.76 --> 01:14:46.84
be free to go off and do whatever you wanted to do and you know Karzai said I don't care and

656
01:14:46.84 --> 01:14:55.80
Sharzai was the governor of Kandahar now the governor of Kandahar is the senior governor in the

657
01:14:55.80 --> 01:15:01.56
South that just how it works and we'll do a lot of power even though you have governors and all

658
01:15:01.56 --> 01:15:08.92
the other provinces so he pretty much laid down the law and you know organized things and slow

659
01:15:08.92 --> 01:15:16.60
but surely you know I started seeing security and Southern Afghanistan just you know shape up and then

660
01:15:16.60 --> 01:15:25.32
and how long did you stay in Afghanistan for for that first rotation from November to March and then

661
01:15:28.12 --> 01:15:33.08
the so you left in March of 2002 right had the governor's been put in position yet

662
01:15:33.08 --> 01:15:38.52
oh yeah they were all position in December yeah so at that point there's a pretty good

663
01:15:39.56 --> 01:15:43.96
it looks it's looking pretty good at this point it looks real good it looks real good they're doing at the

664
01:15:43.96 --> 01:15:56.44
Afghan way and and the airfield in Kandahar was something that we wanted to secure

665
01:15:56.44 --> 01:16:03.40
so that we could you know use it to bring in and bring out you know supplies and stuff like that so

666
01:16:05.88 --> 01:16:13.88
general Madness one star general at the time the Marines got that mission and so

667
01:16:15.96 --> 01:16:22.20
their operational area was was really confined to Kandahar airfield and then we had

668
01:16:22.20 --> 01:16:33.24
the Siege's sort of north up in Uzbekistan and then then Commodore Harwood came in to do

669
01:16:33.24 --> 01:16:41.80
Siege's sort of south Kandahar and he works side by side with with General Madness

670
01:16:41.80 --> 01:16:54.04
and we were in Kandahar and our soul advise in assistor responsibilities centered around

671
01:16:54.04 --> 01:16:58.84
Shurzae at this time because Karzai had gone up to take to be the interim prime minister

672
01:16:59.96 --> 01:17:05.08
up in Kabul and so everything that we did we did through with and by

673
01:17:05.08 --> 01:17:13.88
Karzai or Shurzae in coordination with Siege sort of north who was see-towing us and then

674
01:17:14.76 --> 01:17:23.64
Commodore Harwood who was see-towing a separate direct action unit out of Kandahar airfield

675
01:17:24.52 --> 01:17:34.28
and we got this taskless from from Siflek right the combined forces and it was it was a three-star

676
01:17:34.28 --> 01:17:40.60
headquarters right and so it was about 180 different places they wanted to go to

677
01:17:42.20 --> 01:17:50.28
and that was our task to to go do that we had to get that done so when you say go to what

678
01:17:50.28 --> 01:17:56.44
do you mean go to like they thought they thought it was places that had intel or had bad guys in it

679
01:17:56.44 --> 01:18:02.12
and all under 180 of them were dry old like towns villages are like actual target packages

680
01:18:02.12 --> 01:18:07.48
targets without the target packages it was just a little station and we think there's something there

681
01:18:08.28 --> 01:18:16.20
but the places that all 180 of more dry holes but the places that we got all the computers and all the

682
01:18:16.20 --> 01:18:23.48
stuff that that some of them loud was working on and we'll all my was working on we're given to us

683
01:18:23.48 --> 01:18:28.12
by the Afghans that were on the ground hey they worked out of that one they worked out of that

684
01:18:28.12 --> 01:18:34.12
they worked out of this and and we would get a calls and hey we got LK to there see that's where it

685
01:18:34.12 --> 01:18:41.32
became tricky because Taliban were Afghans so you get them and they either switch sides or they

686
01:18:41.32 --> 01:18:48.84
didn't switch sides right and if they didn't switch sides well you know the you know Afghans you know

687
01:18:48.84 --> 01:18:54.84
would would deal them through Afghan wall right and custom whatever LK to different story they were

688
01:18:54.84 --> 01:19:01.32
Arabs and oh we had to be very very careful because there was only one fake for them if they

689
01:19:01.32 --> 01:19:10.68
gotten the hands of the Afghans who had been family said been killed and tortured so on so forth

690
01:19:10.68 --> 01:19:16.92
and they didn't have any real love for them right so that was a whenever we got a report in

691
01:19:16.92 --> 01:19:25.80
sands and the Zalkate s expected LK to guy we would go boom and we would take we would take them

692
01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:32.36
into what I would call protective cops there right and then we would move them by our own means

693
01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:43.96
to be interrogated and by you know coalition side of the house right and so I mean that's that's

694
01:19:43.96 --> 01:19:50.68
kind of difference between the Taliban and LK at the time they're on the ground and how they were

695
01:19:50.68 --> 01:19:56.60
just you know dealt with differently and we didn't really worry about the Afghans because they

696
01:19:56.60 --> 01:20:03.96
always switch sides but it was the it was the LK because they were from Oman they were from Saudi Arabia

697
01:20:03.96 --> 01:20:11.32
they were from Pakistan they were from some other place right and not well but no they were not welcome

698
01:20:11.32 --> 01:20:20.20
and you know one of the worst places to go when we first got there was the soccer field because

699
01:20:20.20 --> 01:20:27.000
that's where all the hangings the headings and the stoning of women took place I mean stoning women

700
01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:34.04
and and the killing of children for flying a kite we handed out thousands of kites when we got

701
01:20:34.04 --> 01:20:39.48
down there because they're huge kite flying folks they have competitions you know where they

702
01:20:39.48 --> 01:20:44.92
tack each other with the kites you know it's just like this huge thing anyways they loved it right

703
01:20:46.12 --> 01:20:51.40
we got them their music we got them things to play with their music we established businesses one of the

704
01:20:52.20 --> 01:20:57.88
one of the first businesses that we established was a woman's laundry and then we used it to clean

705
01:20:57.88 --> 01:21:04.04
our own stuff because by the time we got the time we got the time we got the candahar we stumped right

706
01:21:04.04 --> 01:21:10.60
I mean it was pretty bad so anyways we did that but I'll never forget I was on it was

707
01:21:10.60 --> 01:21:17.32
four o'clock in the morning I was up on the candahar governor's mansion and I was doing my

708
01:21:17.64 --> 01:21:22.84
had my night vision goggles and I got my afghan partner with me and to keep them awake I

709
01:21:22.84 --> 01:21:27.64
had do was give them the goggles because it was like it was amazing to them right it was amazing

710
01:21:27.64 --> 01:21:31.80
to see that technology and they could see because they'd go and then you go back down right

711
01:21:31.80 --> 01:21:36.76
and I know you can't see me on the radio but I mean it you know it's just is what it is but

712
01:21:37.32 --> 01:21:44.36
I'm up there and I see the bakery that we had established you know and the guy goes in for work

713
01:21:44.36 --> 01:21:48.52
and he gets in there and he starts opening up and that's where we got our bread every morning and that

714
01:21:48.52 --> 01:21:56.20
man bread that football shaped bread it was warm it was delicious by that time we were getting peanut

715
01:21:56.20 --> 01:22:01.64
butter and jelly sent to us and my wife sent me a tub of marshmallow because I'm from New Hampshire

716
01:22:01.64 --> 01:22:06.92
and fluffing outers are really good right peanut butter and marshmallow sound so I was looking

717
01:22:06.92 --> 01:22:12.36
for it to it but I'm watching this guy and I go oh there he is you know doing his thing we

718
01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:21.24
he starts you know he gets the dough all done and he gets in the bowl with his feet

719
01:22:21.24 --> 01:22:32.60
and starts kneading it and I'm like no I did not just see that right you can't unsee that and I'm like

720
01:22:32.60 --> 01:22:40.44
and I know what his feet look like right and I'm thinking to myself it's gone I can't eat bread again

721
01:22:42.44 --> 01:22:48.28
and we go get the bread and I'm sitting down and the time commander sitting there and watching the

722
01:22:48.28 --> 01:22:54.12
guys and I go all right guys I gotta tell you I gotta tell you this is what I saw today

723
01:22:55.64 --> 01:22:59.88
I gotta share this with you I hope I don't ruin it for anybody more morally obliquid

724
01:22:59.88 --> 01:23:05.56
I gotta share it with you and I did and they looked at me and they go I don't give me

725
01:23:07.08 --> 01:23:13.24
I'm eating this bread and it goes the brick oven burned it all off and I go I can't get there

726
01:23:13.24 --> 01:23:18.92
I can't get there right so it kind of ruined it for me but anyways it's good

727
01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:26.60
so by the time you leave for the first time in March you know it it looked like things are going

728
01:23:26.60 --> 01:23:32.44
pretty as good as you could want them to go 2002 when do you get back there again

729
01:23:33.16 --> 01:23:41.56
so you know it was interesting I get selected to be the fifth special forces group S3 so I get bumped

730
01:23:41.56 --> 01:23:46.92
up from the batai and go up to the group level and we're now of course

731
01:23:48.28 --> 01:23:54.84
sustaining operations while it had gone to a different group so we didn't have to worry about

732
01:23:54.84 --> 01:24:00.04
Afghanistan anymore at fifth group because we didn't have really there because it was third group

733
01:24:00.04 --> 01:24:07.72
but then we got the warning order for Iraq so we start planning Iraq and then I get called into

734
01:24:07.72 --> 01:24:15.000
my group commanders office he says hey you just got by name requested to go do an interview

735
01:24:15.80 --> 01:24:17.80
to be the secretary of the army's aid

736
01:24:20.52 --> 01:24:24.44
oh joy I go sir I just got the job that I've always wanted

737
01:24:25.72 --> 01:24:32.12
group S3 I mean they didn't get any better than that in a special forces group right and in my mind anyways

738
01:24:32.92 --> 01:24:36.68
and I was like sir I don't I don't want to do that and he goes well you don't have a choice

739
01:24:36.68 --> 01:24:43.08
and he goes and you better not blow it because we need an SF guy at that level it's never happened

740
01:24:43.08 --> 01:24:48.04
before so we need you there right we need you there so you go there and you do the best you can

741
01:24:48.04 --> 01:24:56.76
if you don't get picked don't worry about it but don't sabotage it so I go there and Tom White

742
01:24:56.76 --> 01:25:04.68
is a secretary and I do my interview and I'm sitting at home and I get a call

743
01:25:04.68 --> 01:25:11.88
Tom White don't you're gonna be my aid we got two weeks together here

744
01:25:13.88 --> 01:25:19.64
and I go holy crap so I call my boss and I tell him he goes you know congratulations it's

745
01:25:19.64 --> 01:25:26.52
great it's gonna be great for the SF community blah blah it's funny because the entire time I was

746
01:25:26.52 --> 01:25:33.08
the aid there I never got a call from the SF community once but I did what I was told to do and I

747
01:25:33.08 --> 01:25:38.76
went there and I was the aid for Tom White and what a great experience that was what I wanted you

748
01:25:38.76 --> 01:25:46.68
to do it for what a great one year so you get right and then you move on and then so that's what

749
01:25:46.68 --> 01:25:54.36
year was that that you were the aid 2000 June a 2002 to June a 2003 got it right and then

750
01:25:56.20 --> 01:26:01.48
I went what did you before you jump in and where you went next what did you you said it was a great

751
01:26:01.48 --> 01:26:07.32
experience I was fortunate enough you know as fortunate as you can get would you become an

752
01:26:07.32 --> 01:26:13.80
aid I was fortunate enough to be the aid for for the seal Admiral Admiral Maguire and definitely

753
01:26:13.80 --> 01:26:19.80
was loved yeah he's a great guy great guy but I was very lucky that I was able to do that job

754
01:26:19.80 --> 01:26:24.04
because I got to see a lot and got to understand what was happening and understand how these high

755
01:26:24.04 --> 01:26:28.52
level decisions were made and see a little bit into the future what was it from from your experience

756
01:26:28.52 --> 01:26:34.44
what did you see that what did you learn that was important well all of what you just learned

757
01:26:34.44 --> 01:26:42.20
but more importantly I learned how all the you know how these decisions have made inside the

758
01:26:42.20 --> 01:26:49.40
the political level right from the top and all these things that are done so when I got back

759
01:26:49.40 --> 01:26:55.48
to the tactical level I could explain to the guys what's going on at the strategic level and although

760
01:26:55.48 --> 01:27:02.84
although they may not like it at least I had a familiarity and an understanding and be able to

761
01:27:02.84 --> 01:27:08.44
explain what's going on in the whole process and why we're sitting here you know waiting to be

762
01:27:08.44 --> 01:27:13.24
ordered to go do something or what would have you but I learned how the army worked

763
01:27:13.24 --> 01:27:19.32
sitting in the hello and a lot of us go through help there's a lot of guys that get promoted to

764
01:27:19.32 --> 01:27:23.56
general officer and they don't even know how the army works right because they've never been in a

765
01:27:23.56 --> 01:27:29.64
job that taught him how the army works it's just a matter so you know there I am you know I'm

766
01:27:29.64 --> 01:27:36.68
the you know battle buddy of the secretary of the army you know and he depends on me for everything right

767
01:27:36.68 --> 01:27:45.16
and and it was just a phenomenal opportunity to learn how the army works and how the army fits

768
01:27:45.16 --> 01:27:51.72
into the larger service and how the joint chiefs of staff works and you know how all these things

769
01:27:51.72 --> 01:28:01.88
go and and so you know I did not want to leave the group S3 job at all I just you know I

770
01:28:01.88 --> 01:28:07.48
didn't want to and when I got asked the question by secretary white you know do you want to be

771
01:28:07.48 --> 01:28:15.16
they you want this job and my answer was sir I'll be honored to serve as an aide but

772
01:28:15.16 --> 01:28:23.72
I'd rather be this special forces group S3 to heck and I was told later that's why I got the job

773
01:28:23.72 --> 01:28:29.000
because everybody else they interviewed wanted to be they and I didn't so they gave it to the guy

774
01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:37.72
that didn't want it and and I went there and I gave him 100 100 100% like I would do any job

775
01:28:37.72 --> 01:28:43.000
if they made me the floor sweeper would be the best man swept for an army right that's just the way

776
01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:47.72
it goes right you just go do whatever job they give you and do it best of your ability and then you

777
01:28:47.72 --> 01:28:56.36
know you know good things will happen and so I did that and then I went over to I got picked up

778
01:28:56.36 --> 01:29:03.24
for lieutenant colonel and I got picked up for tying command first battalion third group and I had to

779
01:29:03.24 --> 01:29:08.76
do some joint time so I went over and I worked for I was the executive officer for the assistant

780
01:29:08.76 --> 01:29:14.12
secretary of defense for special operations of the intensity conflict so then I got to see how the

781
01:29:14.12 --> 01:29:21.56
OSD worked and how all of that went and I always like to say how it works and doesn't work right

782
01:29:21.56 --> 01:29:26.36
because it's both sides of the coin right but it is good excellent experience and I met some really

783
01:29:26.36 --> 01:29:40.44
great people there that I have relationships with to this day but that was three June of 2003

784
01:29:41.64 --> 01:29:48.92
and then I went and took command of fifth special forces group first battalion third special

785
01:29:48.92 --> 01:29:53.88
forces group the desert equals and we did two back to back tours to Afghanistan there

786
01:29:53.88 --> 01:30:05.80
and that was that was awesome one of the only battalions that ever did back to back tours

787
01:30:05.80 --> 01:30:10.84
it's just the way it worked out so we went there for nine months came back for six went back

788
01:30:10.84 --> 01:30:17.96
for another nine months and then I went up to use the socket for the the amount of continuity you

789
01:30:17.96 --> 01:30:23.08
know it's one thing that when you compare let's say world war two with either the end of

790
01:30:23.08 --> 01:30:27.80
Korean war or the Vietnam war where you have guys coming on tour they're gonna do a year and then

791
01:30:27.80 --> 01:30:35.08
they're gonna leave and that's that's that's almost a continuity when you do nine months there

792
01:30:35.08 --> 01:30:40.04
six months home and then nine months back there you start to get some real continuity what what

793
01:30:40.04 --> 01:30:46.28
did you see in that deployment or those two deployments you get to see like a bigger arc of the story

794
01:30:46.28 --> 01:30:54.68
yes with with a better thread through it so we really saw the the reemergence and the

795
01:30:54.68 --> 01:31:02.60
resurgence of the Taliban and al-Qaeda in 2005 when we got there may have 2005 is when we got there

796
01:31:02.60 --> 01:31:08.04
now now obviously 2003 I think I might have cut you off when you were about to say this before but

797
01:31:08.04 --> 01:31:15.32
2003 things are looking about as good as we could hope in Afghanistan the war kicks off in Iraq

798
01:31:15.32 --> 01:31:22.12
that means people are you know American soldiers resources are now pouring into Iraq that

799
01:31:22.12 --> 01:31:29.56
sort of becomes the focus and and that allows over in Afghanistan where we had had a big presence

800
01:31:29.56 --> 01:31:35.80
now something that's drawn down now the sudden the you know al-Qaeda and the Taliban start to see

801
01:31:35.80 --> 01:31:42.60
opportunities yes and so when you roll back in it's now 2005 and now they've taken advantage of

802
01:31:42.60 --> 01:31:49.000
some of these opportunities they have taken advantage of the opportunity and I'll never forget

803
01:31:49.000 --> 01:32:02.52
September 11th 2005 I was on a hilltop with Charlie Company commander and in the

804
01:32:02.52 --> 01:32:23.40
Kandahar province and there were 1500 wave after wave of Taliban fighters coming at us it was unbelievable

805
01:32:23.40 --> 01:32:36.68
September 11th 2005 that was I had been you know I mean 2011 I mean September 11 2001 that long ago

806
01:32:36.68 --> 01:32:47.08
right and you're right I mean we had it looked good in 2002 2003 and four we didn't have the

807
01:32:47.08 --> 01:32:52.36
resources that we needed but we were still doing nation building we were still building an army

808
01:32:52.36 --> 01:32:57.000
we were still building the police we were putting together there justice system we were putting

809
01:32:57.000 --> 01:33:03.88
together there constitution so on so forth all that was working but there wasn't anybody to keep

810
01:33:03.88 --> 01:33:11.08
the pressure on them right and so they researched and so we saw the front of that and Kandahar province

811
01:33:11.08 --> 01:33:28.44
in 2005 September 11th Operation Ladusa and you know it was a big operation and it was just

812
01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:34.28
it was just unbelievable what was going on during that time frame in terms of you know enemy

813
01:33:34.28 --> 01:33:42.92
capability capacity strength numbers and it wasn't just southern Afghanistan which is where my

814
01:33:42.92 --> 01:33:48.76
batay it was it was in the north it was in the east you know predominantly at that time in the

815
01:33:48.76 --> 01:33:55.64
east we were on the border right wow that was just incredible right so we're going on all over the place

816
01:33:55.64 --> 01:34:00.12
right you know when when you talked earlier you mentioned that you know we were helping them

817
01:34:00.12 --> 01:34:05.08
we were right in the constitution we were setting up the government and there's a you know when

818
01:34:05.08 --> 01:34:11.88
I talk about leadership a lot which I do I talk about what happens when you try and impose your plan

819
01:34:11.88 --> 01:34:18.28
onto your subordinates onto your team you impose your plan onto them look you can kind of get away

820
01:34:18.28 --> 01:34:22.92
with it sometimes depending on the authority that you have depending on the amount of leadership

821
01:34:22.92 --> 01:34:27.48
capital that you have depending on how much oversight you're allowed to kind of sit there and

822
01:34:27.48 --> 01:34:33.000
if you're going to impose their plan the plan on them and then you have the tenacity and the

823
01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:40.20
ability to sort of continue to put the pressure on them then maybe maybe you can pull it off

824
01:34:40.20 --> 01:34:45.48
but it's much better from a leadership perspective to say hey Don you know here's this mission

825
01:34:45.48 --> 01:34:51.64
how do you want to do it and kind of let you come up with the plan it seems like America has a

826
01:34:51.64 --> 01:34:59.40
tendency to want to impose you know our way onto countries whether it's Vietnam or there's

827
01:34:59.40 --> 01:35:06.76
the Vietnam thing the way that unfolded and the way we tried to sort of impose what we wanted it to

828
01:35:06.76 --> 01:35:15.72
look like and the Vietnamese don't like that they they they've fought against that forever and they've

829
01:35:15.72 --> 01:35:20.84
never been beaten and so they weren't going to be beaten and and it wasn't that they didn't like

830
01:35:20.84 --> 01:35:26.04
what we were saying it's just that they wanted to say what they wanted to say so so you know here we

831
01:35:26.04 --> 01:35:33.64
are with the Afghans so doing a little but doing some imposition on them and and the way that

832
01:35:33.64 --> 01:35:37.80
turns out it's sort of like from a leadership perspective if you don't have the the constant pressure

833
01:35:37.80 --> 01:35:42.60
to say nope nope I this would exactly what I want you to do and I have the the tenacity

834
01:35:42.60 --> 01:35:46.92
and the leadership capital and the resource stuff kind of make you do it which again this is an ideal

835
01:35:46.92 --> 01:35:53.72
mm-hmm how do you think we find ourselves in a situation where we we seem to make that that seems to be

836
01:35:53.72 --> 01:36:01.64
our tendency to want to impose our our way our plan onto other under other people mm-hmm

837
01:36:01.64 --> 01:36:06.60
well to your point I mean it doesn't it doesn't work out well right and and the way we had set it up

838
01:36:06.60 --> 01:36:14.20
there was the US who's doing the military the Germans were doing the police the Italians were doing

839
01:36:14.20 --> 01:36:21.88
the justice system and then there was this collective body that was writing the constitution

840
01:36:22.68 --> 01:36:29.24
and we factored out one of the most important things that goes in a constitution or a

841
01:36:29.24 --> 01:36:35.16
or a document whatever they choose to call it that establishes their their government and how

842
01:36:35.16 --> 01:36:40.60
their government is going to govern in a Muslim country and that is they don't separate church

843
01:36:40.60 --> 01:36:47.48
and state right and that was one of the big mistakes of that document right and then we name the

844
01:36:47.48 --> 01:36:55.000
government for them as well which you know they didn't like either so once they got it turned over

845
01:36:55.000 --> 01:37:00.68
to them they made you know cars I went in they made they made the changes right and we were building

846
01:37:00.68 --> 01:37:08.44
a top-down western government police and military force which isn't culturally the way they do things

847
01:37:08.44 --> 01:37:13.48
it's very decentralized very decentralized and we're trying to centralize it was trying to

848
01:37:13.48 --> 01:37:19.000
centralize it from cool down and they don't do that either you know their political system

849
01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:25.08
is very democratic to begin with it's it's sure is in jurgers and it's local and it's consent

850
01:37:25.08 --> 01:37:30.36
among the tribal elders and the village elders which are which are different right because you

851
01:37:30.36 --> 01:37:36.12
have the tribal elders and they may not be the elected village elders right but they still work

852
01:37:36.12 --> 01:37:42.68
together and they understand and then they have a pecking order of the tribes and so when

853
01:37:42.68 --> 01:37:49.40
stuff goes when stuff is available the tribes get their fair share based off of where they sit

854
01:37:49.40 --> 01:37:54.04
in the pecking order and they're okay with this but we don't like that a lot of times right

855
01:37:54.60 --> 01:38:01.000
because we want the the minority want to get the stuff but they're okay with the stuff they get

856
01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:09.16
because it's good enough right so we went in and we mocked all that up right because we would just

857
01:38:09.16 --> 01:38:13.96
start familiar with the tribes and it's a lot of try to idealistic about the way we think things

858
01:38:13.96 --> 01:38:20.52
are going to be I remember a very similar example we had these young Iraqi soldiers and the officers

859
01:38:20.52 --> 01:38:25.72
were skimming their paychecks and you know my guys coming to me there they're you got their

860
01:38:25.72 --> 01:38:30.28
skimming the paychecks of these young and listed guys so I started talking to my interpreters

861
01:38:30.28 --> 01:38:33.96
and I go hey what's going on can you help us you know if I want to understand what's happening

862
01:38:33.96 --> 01:38:38.20
he's like of course they are he's that the soldiers know that that's that's that's that's

863
01:38:38.20 --> 01:38:41.88
their boss and he's going to take a little piece that's the way it works that's that's that's fine

864
01:38:42.60 --> 01:38:48.20
so us going in and trying to impose what we have this ideal of the way things should be

865
01:38:48.20 --> 01:38:53.16
doesn't always match up culturally in the turns into a problem yes and that's exactly what

866
01:38:53.16 --> 01:38:58.76
you know I mean the same thing happened in Afghanistan right and we were obligated to fix it

867
01:38:58.76 --> 01:39:05.32
which puts us in a position we don't have any real authority to fix right I'm going to

868
01:39:05.32 --> 01:39:08.60
listen to us there's still going to skim it there's still going to do the thing they'll just figure

869
01:39:08.60 --> 01:39:13.64
out a different way to do it and although we see that that is bad I'm not saying it's good I'm

870
01:39:13.64 --> 01:39:19.72
saying it's just the way it is right and over time these things will change like we saw

871
01:39:20.44 --> 01:39:26.76
in Afghanistan right now the ambassador to the United States and Afghanistan is a woman

872
01:39:26.76 --> 01:39:35.72
never would have been that way in 2001 or five or ten but in 20 it's a woman that's great that's

873
01:39:35.72 --> 01:39:42.04
progress they'll figure it out right they have a great university system that they figured out

874
01:39:42.04 --> 01:39:49.48
and it's one of the things we really didn't get involved in and it works right and I don't mean

875
01:39:49.48 --> 01:39:55.64
that that everything we did was terrible because obviously it wasn't but when you start getting

876
01:39:55.64 --> 01:39:59.64
involved in a country's institutions and you start getting involved in their culture and

877
01:39:59.64 --> 01:40:04.12
their society and your outsider it's never going to be received well and you're probably going

878
01:40:04.12 --> 01:40:10.28
to you know trample of or something that you should just you know just stay away from but

879
01:40:10.28 --> 01:40:17.000
the good things will happen as they you know continue to move forward and another thing

880
01:40:17.80 --> 01:40:24.28
that a lot of people in the villages they didn't want to go from the seventh century to the 21st

881
01:40:24.28 --> 01:40:30.68
century right they didn't want to they were very happy being in the seventh century you know

882
01:40:30.68 --> 01:40:35.80
one of the things that I would always tell folks that would would come to you know to do

883
01:40:35.80 --> 01:40:41.88
humanitarian work in Afghanistan I say don't give them coats don't give them shoes they don't want

884
01:40:41.88 --> 01:40:46.68
that all they're going to do they're going to smile at you they're going to say thank you so much

885
01:40:46.68 --> 01:40:51.80
they'll even have kids running around with this stuff on but as soon as you leave kids are taking

886
01:40:51.80 --> 01:40:57.72
it off putting on their sandals you know they wear sandals you know even in the winter time right

887
01:40:57.72 --> 01:41:00.84
they're not going to put on winter boots they're just not going to do it but they're going to take

888
01:41:00.84 --> 01:41:05.32
those winter boots and they're going to put them on trucks and they're going to go to pack a

889
01:41:05.32 --> 01:41:09.88
stand and they're going to sell them and then they're going to come back home because they don't have

890
01:41:09.88 --> 01:41:15.56
any use for what they have use for paper pencils and school products and things along those lines

891
01:41:15.56 --> 01:41:21.64
that they that they will use and they won't go sell because they want their kids to be able to draw

892
01:41:21.64 --> 01:41:27.64
they want their kids to be able to get right they want them to be able to you know so stop giving them

893
01:41:27.64 --> 01:41:33.08
converses sneakers you know it's they're not going to you know they're not going to wear

894
01:41:33.08 --> 01:41:37.40
I mean I'm not going to see basketball quitch break out you know they want soccer balls

895
01:41:37.40 --> 01:41:44.20
and they'll play soccer barefoot and they'll outrun us right and they're bare feet so let's just

896
01:41:44.20 --> 01:41:50.36
you know I think it's you know to your point right I mean it you know it kind of is it's kind of

897
01:41:50.36 --> 01:41:56.68
is what it is and and our guys would see it because our guys would stay there and you know

898
01:41:57.56 --> 01:42:04.12
all the boots and the shoes and the jackets and you know they don't wear hooded sweatshirts you know

899
01:42:04.12 --> 01:42:10.84
give them blankets right they're not going to sport a hooded jacket with a hood on it in the middle of

900
01:42:10.84 --> 01:42:17.48
the Afghan villages they stick out like a sore thumb it's not what they wear right so you know

901
01:42:17.48 --> 01:42:24.20
they like cooking equipment you give them cooking equipment they make a great stew you know

902
01:42:25.48 --> 01:42:31.96
you might pay for it for a few days if if you eat it on our stomach right and the other thing

903
01:42:31.96 --> 01:42:37.40
that we were doing was we were introducing medical supplies that were causing more harm than good

904
01:42:37.40 --> 01:42:45.24
because we needed the medical supplies because the way we grow up and live in America

905
01:42:45.96 --> 01:42:51.000
our immune system is much different than what they look and I used to tell stories I used to tell

906
01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:56.36
a doctor we'd get an Afghan in with a head injury right now bullet wounds through the head right

907
01:42:57.000 --> 01:43:03.08
and the guy he's expecting and I go oh no I wouldn't be so sure please don't call him expecting

908
01:43:03.08 --> 01:43:09.64
this is an Afghan they have incredible healing um did you just the way it is I get a call from the

909
01:43:09.64 --> 01:43:13.48
doctor the next day hey don't you know we're going to believe this the guy's sitting up

910
01:43:14.44 --> 01:43:19.16
spouting all kinds of things and you know post to and I go of course he is he's an Afghan

911
01:43:19.72 --> 01:43:26.36
yeah you know that might have put down an American soldier but not an Afghan that's just the way

912
01:43:26.36 --> 01:43:31.000
they are so please you know I used to go over when our when our Afghan partners would come in and I

913
01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:35.88
would make sure it's a please and I'd have my medics there and I'd say just watch this guy

914
01:43:35.88 --> 01:43:42.68
because they're going to say expect it and we know that he might not be sometimes yes most of the time

915
01:43:42.68 --> 01:43:53.48
no and you know they just have a different constitution because of the way they have to you know

916
01:43:53.48 --> 01:44:01.80
operate and if we bring in all of our amenities we weaken them and we make them more susceptible

917
01:44:02.36 --> 01:44:08.68
to getting sick and and dying yeah it's not their their way of life it's not their way life and

918
01:44:08.68 --> 01:44:16.36
and they don't want it right you know they do have their idea of of medical care so don't exceed it

919
01:44:16.36 --> 01:44:22.44
right just come up to it bring it back bring the doctor back back bring the nurse back bring

920
01:44:22.44 --> 01:44:31.56
those skills back that the Taliban had a trip down to nothing and that's what they need so those

921
01:44:31.56 --> 01:44:39.32
so those two deployments back to back that's 2000 was it was a 2006 2007 so it was 2005 to

922
01:44:39.32 --> 01:44:46.92
six and six to seven yeah and those so what type of operations or your guys doing because

923
01:44:46.92 --> 01:44:52.12
now you you were the batit first batit commander of third special for what what operations were you guys

924
01:44:52.12 --> 01:45:00.36
were you guys doing so we were doing we were assisting the Afghan National Army at the time with you

925
01:45:00.36 --> 01:45:10.20
know shaping and clearing operations right and then we'd want to put we'd want to hold that area

926
01:45:10.20 --> 01:45:14.84
in a way that we hadn't been holding it before so we introduced kind of the hold because it used to be

927
01:45:14.84 --> 01:45:19.88
shape it go clear it and then leave and then they'd come back in so let's hold it let's figure out

928
01:45:19.88 --> 01:45:30.52
away to hold it and that's where the first ideas about bottom up security came into play in 2005

929
01:45:30.52 --> 01:45:37.08
six and seven so you're you're setting up uh where was it Afghan police was it local police idea

930
01:45:37.08 --> 01:45:42.52
of Afghan local police right came in there and at that time we were just calling them in the

931
01:45:42.52 --> 01:45:49.08
Arbachai right and we had the support of the had Arbachai means like security local security

932
01:45:49.08 --> 01:45:53.72
yeah it means their local security so like back in the day when they were fighting

933
01:45:55.000 --> 01:46:05.64
Alexander the Great and Gangas Khan and the Brits and the Russians the Kabul the King of Afghanistan

934
01:46:05.64 --> 01:46:13.08
wouldn't send down national troops to deal with the problem he would organize local arbachai

935
01:46:14.36 --> 01:46:18.92
and the village elders and the tribal elders they go and they get their weapons out of their

936
01:46:18.92 --> 01:46:23.32
you know um out of their huts and they mud huts and they would come and they would report

937
01:46:24.12 --> 01:46:30.28
and they would defend Afghanistan and that's how they would do it yeah there's so many similarities

938
01:46:30.28 --> 01:46:36.60
you know from from my experience and I rack and and in 2006 and in the city of Ramadi the

939
01:46:37.64 --> 01:46:44.20
when the the army came in looked the army worked hard they when they I racky army came in

940
01:46:44.20 --> 01:46:50.84
they worked hard they they sacrificed greatly they fought hard they were a bunch of shea

941
01:46:51.56 --> 01:46:57.64
going into a Sunni city and that right there you're already starting off on the wrong foot I mean

942
01:46:57.64 --> 01:47:01.40
and that's not even put it that's putting it extremely mildly to say you're starting off in the

943
01:47:01.40 --> 01:47:07.48
wrong foot you you're deal with people that have a history of killing each other and so you got the

944
01:47:07.48 --> 01:47:15.000
strong shea army coming into the Sunni city and look the Sunnis inside Ramadi realize look

945
01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:20.04
the their after al Qaeda their after these insurgents their after these foreign fighters so we were able

946
01:47:20.04 --> 01:47:30.04
to to get through it but it wasn't until the the the the Suns of Iraq and the Iraqi police the

947
01:47:30.04 --> 01:47:36.60
local the local Sunni tribesmen tribal leaders the sheaq said you know what we want to defend

948
01:47:36.60 --> 01:47:41.80
our own city let us put our tribe let us put our tribesmen in the police force that's what we did

949
01:47:41.80 --> 01:47:47.80
and then it was a game changer because now you had the local tribal leader had his tribesmen

950
01:47:47.80 --> 01:47:54.04
with police uniforms on authorized by him saying yep we we don't want bad guys here and the

951
01:47:54.04 --> 01:47:58.04
local popping is going yep that's that's our tribe and there's several tribes there multiple tribes

952
01:47:58.04 --> 01:48:04.52
with they all agreed that that's what needed to happen so this idea of you know decentralized command

953
01:48:04.52 --> 01:48:10.04
but also this idea of hey the people that are on the ground that are from there they know who's

954
01:48:10.04 --> 01:48:15.80
good and who's bad and the local populist is going to support the neighborhood kids that are now

955
01:48:15.80 --> 01:48:22.68
neighborhood police and that's just it's it we were lucky enough to kind of watch that unfold

956
01:48:22.68 --> 01:48:27.72
I was lucky enough to watch that unfold and and see those the what they called the Suns of Iraq

957
01:48:27.72 --> 01:48:34.36
and it was interesting too because in Iraq there had been there had been out in al-Kaim the Marine

958
01:48:34.36 --> 01:48:38.76
Corps had pushed through al-Kaim and when they did it there was a bunch of locals going hey there's

959
01:48:38.76 --> 01:48:42.68
bad guys in that building over there there's bad and so the Marines said hey you know what let's

960
01:48:42.68 --> 01:48:49.64
organize these guys and they made this this thing called desert protector which was hey if you're

961
01:48:49.64 --> 01:48:54.04
a local and you want to help us out cool you can join this program called desert protector and they

962
01:48:54.04 --> 01:49:00.68
started to send it was working pretty well well when Maliki got elected all of a sudden he

963
01:49:00.68 --> 01:49:05.40
looks out an al-ambar province and they got all these desert protectors out there and he goes

964
01:49:05.40 --> 01:49:12.44
way to second now I got a bunch of random rogue security forces running around I can't have

965
01:49:12.44 --> 01:49:19.40
that I can't I can't have that so he shut it now which which was not a great move but you can see

966
01:49:19.40 --> 01:49:24.52
from his perspective he doesn't want a bunch of rogue paramilitary units run around but we were

967
01:49:24.52 --> 01:49:29.40
able to convince the the shakes in Ramadi because they were asking we wanted you to desert protector

968
01:49:29.40 --> 01:49:33.64
we want to do that we were able to say look at we we can't do desert protectors not around anymore

969
01:49:33.64 --> 01:49:39.000
but you can be Iraqi policemen you can be local and we'll help you train and that's what we did

970
01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:47.08
so what you're talking about it's very similar very similar yes yeah well you know I mean as you

971
01:49:47.08 --> 01:49:53.72
point it out the the cultures are you know very similar in the way they approach things and there's

972
01:49:53.72 --> 01:49:59.64
the principles that really work and apply from one place to the other the techniques

973
01:49:59.64 --> 01:50:06.60
and the tactics and the approach might require adjustment but nonetheless standard principles

974
01:50:06.60 --> 01:50:14.68
remain the same and that's what you're talking about and I think that one of the biggest

975
01:50:14.68 --> 01:50:21.64
things that we saw in 2005 to 2007 was that this brought about I'm up approach has merit over

976
01:50:21.64 --> 01:50:26.52
a top down approach right although there are aspects of the top down approach that you still need

977
01:50:26.52 --> 01:50:31.88
to apply but really if you're talking about security and safeguarding

978
01:50:31.88 --> 01:50:42.04
population and making that area in area that the enemy can't operate in that's going to be

979
01:50:42.04 --> 01:50:47.24
the way that you need to go and from 2007 to five to seven we learned that but the other thing

980
01:50:47.24 --> 01:50:56.28
that we learned was during this time frame you know the US you know transitioned the mission to

981
01:50:56.28 --> 01:51:02.36
NATO and that's when it became a full fledged NATO operation and a very good friend of mine

982
01:51:02.36 --> 01:51:06.92
Dave Frazier who's written a book about Afghanistan at about his time they're during this time

983
01:51:06.92 --> 01:51:17.64
took over that's when they went from 06 as curdles and in some cases navy captains commanding

984
01:51:17.64 --> 01:51:24.76
the regional commands you know north southeast and west in Afghanistan to general officer level

985
01:51:24.76 --> 01:51:31.80
headquarters and Dave came in he was a Canadian special ops guy who I had had a relationship with

986
01:51:31.80 --> 01:51:41.88
really really good guy and when we got into Afghanistan he said hey I need to come over here I

987
01:51:41.88 --> 01:51:45.000
need to talk to you about you know what we're going to do and how we're going to do this because we

988
01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:54.44
got a problem and more than we came in here to do peacekeeping operations and although it's

989
01:51:54.44 --> 01:51:59.96
not popular thing to say my assessment is is that we're fighting an insurgency and a deadly one

990
01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:06.68
and he knew that that was our assessment as well our intel guys and everybody had the same assessment

991
01:52:06.68 --> 01:52:13.16
going in there from first to time third group and our group headquarters up north so

992
01:52:13.16 --> 01:52:22.68
anyways he called me in and we said well I think we can come up with an operation using the afghan

993
01:52:25.24 --> 01:52:33.80
national security forces to come up into this district panjouay and take over this stronghold of

994
01:52:33.80 --> 01:52:42.36
insurgence right and so we went back we did some planning we came back and briefed him and so what

995
01:52:42.36 --> 01:52:52.68
Charlie company first battalion got the mission and it was a instead of coming at them from

996
01:52:53.64 --> 01:52:59.56
you know uh can to heart province you know directly or helmet province where they expected it

997
01:52:59.56 --> 01:53:05.64
to come we went all the way down south into the red desert which is the red desert now when you fly

998
01:53:06.04 --> 01:53:15.72
in southern afghanistan and you're flying you know east of west or west to east there's the

999
01:53:15.72 --> 01:53:21.48
red desert that heads all the way down into Pakistan and it's nothing but desert and then there's a

1000
01:53:21.48 --> 01:53:27.72
distinct line that goes into the built up areas in the green areas and so on and so forth and it's just

1001
01:53:27.72 --> 01:53:35.72
so blat nobody goes down there only better ones go down there so we did our infiltration and

1002
01:53:35.72 --> 01:53:42.44
a panjouay district that way it took three days we did vehicle recovery operation I mean it was ugly

1003
01:53:42.44 --> 01:53:50.68
right but we got there and completely surprised the Taliban in panjouay and it was a huge victory

1004
01:53:50.68 --> 01:54:02.44
so we brought it them up and then my guys were up for over 96 hours straight me and my command

1005
01:54:02.44 --> 01:54:09.16
started major went in once we took panjouay district and this is where I told you earlier we got

1006
01:54:09.16 --> 01:54:15.48
up on top of the hill it saw all the Taliban coming it was unbelievable well anyways once we

1007
01:54:15.48 --> 01:54:21.000
got control that situation our guys my those guys had in slept for 96 hours and I called my

1008
01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:25.24
headquarters and I said how I'm going to stay son major and I'm going to stay here overnight so

1009
01:54:25.24 --> 01:54:34.76
canceled the CH47 coming again us and so we did that and I knew if I had told my guys that

1010
01:54:34.76 --> 01:54:40.60
the sardine major and I were going to pull the entire night shift so they could sleep I would have

1011
01:54:40.60 --> 01:54:45.80
got a bunch of pushback right no sir you're not going to be pulling guard right now yeah I would

1012
01:54:45.80 --> 01:54:50.84
so I just kept my mouth shut and I said hey I'll take first watch they go oh you don't have to do that

1013
01:54:50.84 --> 01:54:55.88
and I go now I take first watch well these guys went down hard and the sardine major and I just stayed

1014
01:54:55.88 --> 01:55:01.80
up all night well about two o'clock in the morning my company commander Jared Hill comes out he goes

1015
01:55:01.80 --> 01:55:06.52
sorry what that's going on it's two o'clock in the morning I was supposed to have shift you know I

1016
01:55:06.52 --> 01:55:12.68
slept through what I'm sorry I go no no no we got this go back to bed we're good and he didn't

1017
01:55:12.68 --> 01:55:23.64
argue with me went back to bed and none of them had to pull shift it was just me and the sard

1018
01:55:23.64 --> 01:55:30.44
major and we did radio watch and did the whole thing if we called in all the all the times right

1019
01:55:30.44 --> 01:55:39.64
and then that was that and these guys got up not only did I have that but I also had the helicopter

1020
01:55:39.64 --> 01:55:48.60
come in with hot chow right hot breakfast right and so I said you guys get your hot breakfast

1021
01:55:48.60 --> 01:55:53.56
and the sardine major and I will hand it back over to you and you know you got it right and

1022
01:55:53.56 --> 01:56:03.64
you know it was just amazing what these guys had done general Fraser and his book writes

1023
01:56:03.64 --> 01:56:12.92
today about our guys and he says they saved the NATO mission because if we didn't have these

1024
01:56:12.92 --> 01:56:20.84
special ops guys to do this we would have been routed by the Taliban and it would have been a

1025
01:56:20.84 --> 01:56:31.40
huge political nightmare for NATO. First Battalion third group my guys got awarded for the first time

1026
01:56:32.44 --> 01:56:42.44
the equivalent of the Canadian presidential unit citation the only foreign military in the history

1027
01:56:42.44 --> 01:56:46.60
of the Canadian military to get that award and they got that award and it sits in the

1028
01:56:46.60 --> 01:56:53.08
battalion headquarters at Fort Bragg proudly and you know they sent down their equivalent to their

1029
01:56:54.04 --> 01:56:59.40
chairman of the joint chiefs of staff to Fort Bragg and all the guys got it penned on him it took him

1030
01:57:01.48 --> 01:57:08.12
four years to get it approved but he didn't quit and he finally got it approved and I was I was just

1031
01:57:08.12 --> 01:57:14.84
getting out of the work college at that time was 2009 when they when they did the award and I was just

1032
01:57:14.84 --> 01:57:24.36
so proud to see these guys get the award and do they're thing but yeah it was I mean and that that's

1033
01:57:24.36 --> 01:57:34.36
really what kind of got us thinking and you know who got thinking general crystal and when he came in

1034
01:57:34.36 --> 01:57:42.04
in 2010 to take over he was all about bottom up all about it and then when general portrays came

1035
01:57:42.04 --> 01:57:49.000
and it take over for him oh he loved village stability operations in Afghan local police and

1036
01:57:50.20 --> 01:57:55.16
so when you before we get into that so you get done with your Battalion Commander tour

1037
01:57:55.88 --> 01:58:02.04
2007 something like that yeah July 2007 and he changed command and then you go to work college

1038
01:58:02.04 --> 01:58:13.96
yeah I go up to use the sock headquarters from basically August to May of 2008 and I get selected

1039
01:58:13.96 --> 01:58:21.64
for the work college and I go off to the work college but another great opportunity when I went to

1040
01:58:22.60 --> 01:58:30.68
our three star headquarters which is a place nobody wants to go but you know you go there I got put

1041
01:58:30.68 --> 01:58:37.72
in the to be the deputy G8 and the deputy what the G8 does in that headquarters is they do

1042
01:58:38.60 --> 01:58:45.08
they do all the combat developments and the resources and the budget and you know all that stuff

1043
01:58:45.08 --> 01:58:51.000
and I so I learned that and then I learned how use the sock not only fits into so calm

1044
01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:56.76
and how we compete for resources there but also how we compete for resources in the army

1045
01:58:56.76 --> 01:59:03.64
and how our tier one guys how they get all their resources and how the Rangers get all their

1046
01:59:03.64 --> 01:59:09.08
resources and everybody and so that was huge right and so I was right in the middle of that process

1047
01:59:09.08 --> 01:59:15.80
because we were right in the middle of of doing all of that for the next five years

1048
01:59:16.68 --> 01:59:25.40
and I got put in charge of the movement of seventh group from Fort Bragg

1049
01:59:25.40 --> 01:59:32.20
to Destin Florida for their new headquarters and setting that up and what that would look like

1050
01:59:32.84 --> 01:59:44.76
and although not perfect we really really did create an optimal special forces group headquarters

1051
01:59:44.76 --> 01:59:50.44
with all the Rangers and all the things associated with so they could do all the levels of training

1052
01:59:50.44 --> 01:59:55.88
right there and what you learn about working with communities and briefing communities because there's

1053
01:59:55.88 --> 02:00:02.28
noise things and noise studies and this that you know housing issues and you know is there going to be

1054
02:00:02.28 --> 02:00:08.12
enough housing you know houses all going I'm you just unbelievable right so that was another part you know

1055
02:00:08.12 --> 02:00:14.52
like I told you before with the secretary of the army and then working at ASD and then the joint staff

1056
02:00:14.52 --> 02:00:21.48
and all that all coming together really gave me tremendous insight on on how use of sock

1057
02:00:21.48 --> 02:00:27.32
you know United States Army special operations command works and again a lot of guys

1058
02:00:27.88 --> 02:00:32.68
that make very senior ranks don't have any idea how that works because they don't get the

1059
02:00:32.68 --> 02:00:37.24
opportunity to go there and that was because I come out of the time command I get selected

1060
02:00:37.24 --> 02:00:42.76
for the work college and it's like oh now what the hell we're going to do right and no place for me

1061
02:00:42.76 --> 02:00:48.84
right and they said report to use the sock headquarters and they'll have a job and I originally

1062
02:00:49.88 --> 02:00:55.48
was going to be in the J in the G3 but then I got stuck I got moved over to the G8 because an old

1063
02:00:55.48 --> 02:01:05.48
boss in mind was the was the use of sock G8 Jeffrey puts and he goes oh no I want him right

1064
02:01:06.36 --> 02:01:12.12
he's a fine boy he gonna work his ass off for me right and and he may not like it but he's going to do it

1065
02:01:12.12 --> 02:01:16.76
and so boom so I went there and yeah I was great great really great experience

1066
02:01:17.56 --> 02:01:23.16
and then would you study a war college so I went to the war college and I just studied that you

1067
02:01:23.16 --> 02:01:28.52
know they're curriculum and you get a master's degree in strategic studies so I was like oh this

1068
02:01:28.52 --> 02:01:34.92
is great right so I I've worked at the strategic level right and three different assignments

1069
02:01:35.88 --> 02:01:40.60
and I've worked at the operational level and now I'm going to go and I'm going to get an education

1070
02:01:40.60 --> 02:01:49.96
and the in strategic studies and so it really it it brought together the job experience and

1071
02:01:49.96 --> 02:01:57.64
then an education and kind of mesh that together for me I got a business degree when I went to

1072
02:01:58.84 --> 02:02:04.76
Commander General Staff College because I I'm like you know what when I take over a unit

1073
02:02:04.76 --> 02:02:13.16
it it can't shoot move and communicate like nobody's business right but God do we suck at

1074
02:02:13.16 --> 02:02:18.92
admin budget you know all that stuff that nobody likes to do and they're not comfortable doing it

1075
02:02:18.92 --> 02:02:24.20
so I ended up you know I got a business degree because I thought that that's what officers do right

1076
02:02:24.84 --> 02:02:31.08
and so learning how to run a business I said you know that's going to help me out and it did right

1077
02:02:31.08 --> 02:02:36.68
and so I had the business thing going for me and then I had the you know got to the war college

1078
02:02:38.36 --> 02:02:48.60
Carlisle and and that was just a great experience there as well and but I learned one thing

1079
02:02:48.60 --> 02:02:53.96
at the work college it's not necessarily the war college and what you learn there it's winning

1080
02:02:53.96 --> 02:03:02.84
the gym thorp sports event where all the war colleges come to the army war college and you compete

1081
02:03:03.40 --> 02:03:13.80
right in a variety of different sporting events and the army is only lost at twice

1082
02:03:14.84 --> 02:03:20.44
who do they lose in their history of they usually you lose it to the navy war college

1083
02:03:20.44 --> 02:03:27.88
for the what are the events the national war college their teams are so small right

1084
02:03:28.60 --> 02:03:34.12
because the school is so small they get their butts kicked all the time but the army war college

1085
02:03:34.12 --> 02:03:40.28
and you know you got the army the air force the navy the coastguard academy you know you got

1086
02:03:40.28 --> 02:03:46.76
all those guys that come down and it's a it's three days of feats of strength right

1087
02:03:46.76 --> 02:03:54.52
you know I loved it and and you you play all these sports right during the war college

1088
02:03:54.52 --> 02:04:00.76
only so that the coaches of the different teams in the gym thorp sports competition

1089
02:04:01.72 --> 02:04:11.000
can draft their athletes and then you start training in January after the first of the year

1090
02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:21.08
you get put on a team and then you train all the way up to uh may when they have the event

1091
02:04:21.08 --> 02:04:30.76
what what what event did you do I I was in the uh 800 meter relay and the five mile run

1092
02:04:31.96 --> 02:04:37.80
and we won both those events we had a ringer we had a

1093
02:04:37.80 --> 02:04:47.40
uh some guy with a 357 mile or something we had a a guy on on our team he was a Marine on our

1094
02:04:47.40 --> 02:04:58.76
relay team who was a you know division one relay national champion yeah on a team right and so

1095
02:04:58.76 --> 02:05:10.12
about fair and and our coach was in the 1972 Olympics as an 800 meter relay and so the coach

1096
02:05:11.16 --> 02:05:15.96
you know so he taught us you know how to run you know and and how to pace yourself and how to do it

1097
02:05:16.52 --> 02:05:23.80
yeah it was a blowout it was pretty cool but I had the um

1098
02:05:23.80 --> 02:05:29.000
leg that I had I had the first leg yeah that's right I had the first leg he even knew how to set

1099
02:05:29.000 --> 02:05:35.08
up people for the what legs and you know and he stood right right at the place and he said turn it

1100
02:05:35.08 --> 02:05:42.60
on so as I ran by he goes turn it on and it was you had so much left in you right even though I was

1101
02:05:42.60 --> 02:05:47.88
last I picked everybody off right and that was the whole idea of it because people don't get trained

1102
02:05:47.88 --> 02:05:54.60
and how to run it they just go you know and two laps around a track yeah you know you're gonna start feeling

1103
02:05:54.60 --> 02:06:01.48
it you know no I the 800 which I never did but I was reading an article about it somewhere along the way

1104
02:06:01.48 --> 02:06:08.12
and the 800 they say it's like the most painful event because you know you're running 100 yards it's over

1105
02:06:08.84 --> 02:06:16.12
you run you run a mile or a 16 or even a marathon it's at a lower level of intensity

1106
02:06:16.12 --> 02:06:21.24
he and this this article that I think I think it was an article I read but it pointed out the fact that

1107
02:06:21.24 --> 02:06:27.56
there's zero recreational 800 meter runners they don't exist there's marathon there's people run

1108
02:06:27.56 --> 02:06:32.20
marathon there's people do a little sprint triathlon there's no one that just guts through

1109
02:06:32.84 --> 02:06:40.28
800 meters like for fun it doesn't happen all right so we wrap with the gym form

1110
02:06:40.28 --> 02:06:47.000
championship and it's time for you to go back to work and your next your next thing is you go back

1111
02:06:47.000 --> 02:06:53.24
you go back to Afghanistan again I do I go back for Afghanistan again what proved to be 22 months

1112
02:06:54.44 --> 02:07:05.64
and this is what 2010 2010 and I go back to Afghanistan as an advisor to the RC South Commander

1113
02:07:05.64 --> 02:07:14.28
and at the time it was a Dutch commander by the name of major general de Croife and it was a Dutch guy

1114
02:07:15.40 --> 02:07:23.000
and we were having some general McCristal was concerned about the problems with soft coordination

1115
02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:29.32
so he said hey you're going to take command of siege sotofe so the siege sotofe that's the

1116
02:07:30.04 --> 02:07:34.60
that's a combined joint special operations task force afghanistan this is the first thing that's

1117
02:07:34.60 --> 02:07:39.24
going to be in charge of all special operations in Afghanistan that's correct and you get you get

1118
02:07:39.24 --> 02:07:47.56
tasked with that outside of the tier one guys yeah tier one guys not included so

1119
02:07:49.88 --> 02:07:55.88
anyways we uh I'm going to take command of that that's going to be my brigade level command

1120
02:07:55.88 --> 02:08:00.76
opportunity and I couldn't have been more excited I have Admiral Olson

1121
02:08:00.76 --> 02:08:09.000
and general kerni to thank for that they're the ones that pick me so I was

1122
02:08:10.60 --> 02:08:16.68
had a great relationship with Admiral Olson and general kerni general kerni was then the deputy

1123
02:08:17.88 --> 02:08:26.28
the deputy of socom but before that and during my time as a retired commander he was the sock

1124
02:08:26.28 --> 02:08:31.32
special operations command central commander is a two star so that's how I built that relationship

1125
02:08:31.32 --> 02:08:39.56
with him and general Olson or excuse me Admiral Olson develop a good relationship with him and so they

1126
02:08:39.56 --> 02:08:47.08
picked me for that command but there was some time there so I went to uh I said hey I'll just go early

1127
02:08:47.08 --> 02:08:53.80
right and I'll you know do whatever you need me to do I'll work on a staff I'll do whatever

1128
02:08:53.80 --> 02:08:58.60
you know pick staples out of the rugs I don't care just you know just get in there early and

1129
02:08:58.60 --> 02:09:08.28
get myself you know ready for you know the command and they said hey general McCristal wants

1130
02:09:08.28 --> 02:09:20.92
to go down south and be the special operations liaison to general de kroyce who was not very happy

1131
02:09:20.92 --> 02:09:28.52
about the coordination with his headquarters in RC south and the soft guys so I went down there

1132
02:09:28.52 --> 02:09:33.80
and I got myself established and did that well the interesting thing is general de kroyce went to

1133
02:09:33.80 --> 02:09:41.24
the army work college and there's twenty seminars in the army work college and you get assigned in

1134
02:09:41.24 --> 02:09:51.32
seminar and there's a twenty first one and that's for all the guys deploying out of the war college

1135
02:09:51.32 --> 02:09:58.04
whose family stay right so my wife was in seminar 21 when I left she stayed right there which was

1136
02:09:58.04 --> 02:10:05.24
great continuity for her and the kids because they were there my kids wrestled so one of them

1137
02:10:05.24 --> 02:10:11.32
wrestled for the high school so they were that was just good continuity and we thought it was only

1138
02:10:11.32 --> 02:10:17.000
going to be for here but it ended up being for twenty two months so they ended up staying there

1139
02:10:17.000 --> 02:10:22.28
almost three years which was really good for them but general de kroyce went to the war college

1140
02:10:22.28 --> 02:10:27.32
and he was in seminar eight and I was in seminar eight and we called ourselves the eight balls

1141
02:10:28.28 --> 02:10:31.64
and so when I went in to introduce myself and he said where you're coming from when I said

1142
02:10:31.64 --> 02:10:36.84
the war army work college you go so I went to the army work college too and I go really that's

1143
02:10:36.84 --> 02:10:41.48
great sir I mean I loved it and he goes oh I loved it too I was in seminar eight and I go well

1144
02:10:43.32 --> 02:10:50.20
so was I and he goes no way and and we had the same instructors the same guys there so we were

1145
02:10:50.20 --> 02:10:55.56
able to share that we were able to share stories about Piano and eight ball right and it was automatic

1146
02:10:55.56 --> 02:11:05.96
you know relationship establishment were born everything and so all I did was go to his morning meetings

1147
02:11:05.96 --> 02:11:11.16
be available for him whenever he needed whenever there was operations coming up I made it sure

1148
02:11:11.16 --> 02:11:18.76
that they would de-conflict it and I ended up traveling with him everywhere he went and I've can't

1149
02:11:18.76 --> 02:11:26.44
understand on his plane everywhere he went in the south that's what he wanted me to do and it was

1150
02:11:27.48 --> 02:11:33.96
it was like simple and general my crystal was happy because he was not getting any more

1151
02:11:33.96 --> 02:11:41.08
complaints from the RC South commander and you know and they were valid complaints I might say right

1152
02:11:41.08 --> 02:11:45.32
I mean you know how that goes it's just so much going on right and everybody's trying to do the

1153
02:11:45.32 --> 02:11:52.04
right thing and they're trying to get it done and you know things slip so they got 06 now you know

1154
02:11:52.04 --> 02:11:57.40
a kernel there to make sure that doesn't happen and if it does happen he got 1 god of blame mate

1155
02:11:57.96 --> 02:12:05.16
what else so it was good and you know we just tighten that up and you know it wasn't just soft you

1156
02:12:05.16 --> 02:12:09.48
know it was conventional side it was all kinds of you know everything's going to the state

1157
02:12:09.48 --> 02:12:15.96
department and what they're doing and then the you know other things going on so hey it just worked

1158
02:12:15.96 --> 02:12:24.04
and how long did you do that for I did that for six months let's see from June to

1159
02:12:25.64 --> 02:12:31.48
yeah June to December six months and then after that you took over the CG sort of yeah I went home for two

1160
02:12:31.48 --> 02:12:36.68
weeks for a break in nice vacation yeah two weeks one home for two weeks came back

1161
02:12:36.68 --> 02:12:46.04
took command and stating command of of the special operations there you know the CG sort of

1162
02:12:46.04 --> 02:12:57.56
a until May of 2011 and this is when you started or at what point did the the VSO the

1163
02:12:57.56 --> 02:13:03.80
village stability operations start at it was it at this time yes so because I remember I was

1164
02:13:03.80 --> 02:13:11.40
getting ready to well I retired in 2010 and I was I was running training and as I was running training

1165
02:13:11.40 --> 02:13:18.28
we were starting to have guys do training missions based on VSO based on going out and doing

1166
02:13:18.28 --> 02:13:22.36
tribal engagement and key personnel engagement and going to meet people and villages and

1167
02:13:22.36 --> 02:13:26.92
have on them how they're going to set security and all that stuff we started doing that in 2010

1168
02:13:26.92 --> 02:13:35.64
so I don't know exactly when it came came to fruition but from when did it so it would have been

1169
02:13:35.64 --> 02:13:44.12
about April of 2010 okay that it all started coming to fruition because I got there in 2009 I

1170
02:13:44.12 --> 02:13:52.36
did that then I took command yeah June of 2009 and then I didn't leave until May of 2011 right

1171
02:13:52.36 --> 02:14:03.40
so it was it was about that time frame and you know it was a it was a collection of people

1172
02:14:03.40 --> 02:14:09.16
that were you know putting this together but I happened to be the commander that did the bulk of

1173
02:14:09.16 --> 02:14:14.12
operationalizing it which is the hardest thing to do right the first guy in the breach right

1174
02:14:14.92 --> 02:14:21.000
you know it's it's hard because you got people pushing back against it and you got people that are

1175
02:14:21.000 --> 02:14:26.68
all for it and you know even though general crystal wants it to happen you know there's there's

1176
02:14:26.68 --> 02:14:31.72
many people there with them that don't want it to happen and you got the international community

1177
02:14:31.72 --> 02:14:40.84
and and even my own community right they were skeptical of it because they saw it as a special

1178
02:14:40.84 --> 02:14:46.04
forces mission so bringing in Marsauk and bringing in the seals to do this kind of mission

1179
02:14:46.04 --> 02:14:49.80
they were like hey that's not their mission and this is a bad precedent and this that

1180
02:14:49.80 --> 02:14:56.12
you know thing and I'm like hey but you know okay so give me more ODAs right I mean you know

1181
02:14:56.12 --> 02:15:02.04
I came up with a term and the joint staff because everyone was using the word fungible right

1182
02:15:02.44 --> 02:15:09.32
and I happen to be given somebody a brief right and and it was about using special ops and you know

1183
02:15:09.32 --> 02:15:14.76
we're better when we work together right because we have just we just aren't right so anyways

1184
02:15:14.76 --> 02:15:23.80
I said and you know special ops puts the fun in fungible you know because that was the big

1185
02:15:23.80 --> 02:15:29.56
strategic word at the time right and so the more you could show you were fungible the better

1186
02:15:29.56 --> 02:15:34.76
off you were so we're fungible is hell right and and that's what that's what we do so

1187
02:15:34.76 --> 02:15:45.64
so anyways we yeah we we just you know came together and did it and every single

1188
02:15:46.28 --> 02:15:53.40
whether it was Marsauk whether it was you know their teams or the Navy seal teams or the

1189
02:15:53.40 --> 02:16:00.52
special forces teams these platforms did really really well and just give us a quick brief on the idea

1190
02:16:00.52 --> 02:16:06.68
of of the VSO of the of the village stability operations what was so if if I was an ODA team leader

1191
02:16:06.68 --> 02:16:12.20
I was a seal platoon leader what was what was my mission what was it gonna look like so your mission is to go

1192
02:16:12.20 --> 02:16:20.68
is to go into say it's you know can't do hard province and it's a district X and you're gonna go in there

1193
02:16:20.68 --> 02:16:26.20
and you're gonna figure out what is the best village to start a village stability platform

1194
02:16:26.20 --> 02:16:32.44
which consists of your team and additional augmentation of intel guys and you know there's

1195
02:16:32.44 --> 02:16:36.04
things that you're gonna need in order to be able to operate there you're gonna go in you're

1196
02:16:36.04 --> 02:16:41.08
gonna talk to the village elders and the tribal elders and you're gonna figure out where you need to

1197
02:16:41.08 --> 02:16:47.96
be now they're gonna tell you where you need to be and you're gonna go with it and if it's the wrong

1198
02:16:47.96 --> 02:16:54.76
place don't worry about it we can change it so just just go with the flow just go in there

1199
02:16:54.76 --> 02:17:01.40
there in charge there the guys that are gonna tell us where to go and over time you'll figure out

1200
02:17:01.40 --> 02:17:05.80
if it's the right place or not and then working with them if you got to change the place you

1201
02:17:05.80 --> 02:17:11.32
don't want it because what's gonna happen is there are of this top-down mindset okay the US is coming in

1202
02:17:11.32 --> 02:17:16.28
and they're gonna come in with a whole bunch of good stuff and we're gonna be able to take it

1203
02:17:16.28 --> 02:17:20.12
advantage of it while they're gonna realize over time we're not coming in there with Jack

1204
02:17:20.12 --> 02:17:25.96
right yeah just go talk to the audience and see if the dudes are out there in the middle of nowhere

1205
02:17:25.96 --> 02:17:32.20
that's right and so some hasco barriers and if we can sack common attention have fun boys

1206
02:17:32.20 --> 02:17:36.44
right and we're not coming in with a with a big bag of money and a whole bunch of things that they're

1207
02:17:36.44 --> 02:17:40.92
gonna be able to you know take advantage of and then they're gonna realize wow hold the crap right

1208
02:17:41.48 --> 02:17:46.92
and but what we are gonna do is we're gonna come in with the ability to be able to prove to them

1209
02:17:46.92 --> 02:17:52.84
that they can secure themselves and we'll develop this Afghan local police program and they're in

1210
02:17:52.84 --> 02:17:58.68
charge and nominating the people for this program so we we get their fingerprint their thumbprint

1211
02:17:58.68 --> 02:18:04.12
on that guy and so if that guy does something it discredit the village elder and the tribal elder

1212
02:18:04.68 --> 02:18:10.28
so you're not gonna really get back it now did we have some problems yes we did but the problems

1213
02:18:10.28 --> 02:18:17.48
were my new and we started we started clearing these you know clearing and holding these areas

1214
02:18:19.000 --> 02:18:26.76
and with the Afghan local police program and yeah and it's based more on relationships that you

1215
02:18:26.76 --> 02:18:35.08
form with the locals more than it's based on imposing your will of the locals which you can only

1216
02:18:35.08 --> 02:18:41.40
do that if you've got the strength and the consistency and to do that all the time right which is

1217
02:18:41.40 --> 02:18:46.76
it's impossible it's impossible it's impossible and so some of the challenges that I was presented

1218
02:18:46.76 --> 02:18:52.76
with was hey you're putting these guys in in harm's way they're gonna all get killed one night

1219
02:18:53.56 --> 02:18:59.72
the Taliban is just gonna overrun them and I said well I don't think so our guys are smarter than

1220
02:18:59.72 --> 02:19:03.48
that they're not gonna allow themselves to be overrun they're gonna keep their finger on the

1221
02:19:03.48 --> 02:19:08.52
pulse on the intel we're gonna use the relationships that they have in the post-tune wall

1222
02:19:08.52 --> 02:19:12.84
we code and people kind of laughed when I said post-tune wall it could be a post but it is strong

1223
02:19:12.84 --> 02:19:21.72
you know and it consists of you know supporting strangers it consists of revenge right and

1224
02:19:22.92 --> 02:19:31.96
that's what they basically operate off of and they accepted us in and we became their responsibility

1225
02:19:31.96 --> 02:19:39.96
and as a result of becoming their responsibility anything happened to our guys

1226
02:19:41.000 --> 02:19:45.32
now did we get guys injured and did guys get killed yeah but that was in combat operations

1227
02:19:45.32 --> 02:19:52.92
and they died right along with us right the just combat operations and combat operations but

1228
02:19:54.04 --> 02:19:58.60
did we ever get overrun no and this was in the middle of the time where you saw conventional

1229
02:19:58.60 --> 02:20:05.64
outpost being overrun right and you know all over Afghanistan and this is conventional units

1230
02:20:05.64 --> 02:20:12.68
that put themselves in valleys in in places that they shouldn't have put themselves because

1231
02:20:13.88 --> 02:20:22.36
they were operating independently of the the Afghan cultures protection right and so

1232
02:20:22.36 --> 02:20:35.40
ended up by 2011 when I left we had 90 locations and none of them ever got run over none of them

1233
02:20:35.40 --> 02:20:41.000
ever got attacked the Afghans were all over I mean they knew they never lost a fight against

1234
02:20:41.000 --> 02:20:47.96
the Taliban they were protecting their families and they took it seriously and when they saw

1235
02:20:47.96 --> 02:20:56.12
the progress they were making and this big bad Taliban guy was defitable and they saw

1236
02:20:56.60 --> 02:21:01.88
they were like whoa then they got the will to fight and they had the mission and they realized

1237
02:21:01.88 --> 02:21:06.60
that their freedom and their destiny to live life the way they wanted to live was in their hands

1238
02:21:07.24 --> 02:21:13.40
and that they didn't need the American military or international forces to secure their

1239
02:21:13.40 --> 02:21:19.000
freedom for it they could do themselves but we need you help a little bit right we need you help a

1240
02:21:19.000 --> 02:21:23.56
little bit but when we got it we got it and that's where the transition piece came in

1241
02:21:24.20 --> 02:21:30.68
yeah it's interesting because you know I was saying that not only can we as Americans

1242
02:21:31.40 --> 02:21:36.20
impose our will on every village in the country guess who else can't do that let's tell

1243
02:21:36.20 --> 02:21:41.24
it about that right so so if you got it you got to make those connections it's decentralized

1244
02:21:41.24 --> 02:21:46.92
command it's building relationships and had a pretty positive I mean a very positive impact

1245
02:21:46.92 --> 02:21:54.52
on what was happening in Afghanistan 2000 was at 2010 2011 into 2012 and 13 things are moving

1246
02:21:55.08 --> 02:22:01.40
in the right in the right direction right and you know like I said General McCristal put it in place

1247
02:22:01.96 --> 02:22:09.000
he was replaced by General Petraeus and General Petraeus became a huge huge advocate of this

1248
02:22:09.000 --> 02:22:16.76
and one of the things that General Petraeus did was he said don what do you need to expand this

1249
02:22:17.56 --> 02:22:22.12
and I said well we're kind of limited sir with just our special operation forces

1250
02:22:23.48 --> 02:22:27.80
but if we could get augmentation from the conventional forces

1251
02:22:29.24 --> 02:22:36.28
then we could expand right and we could we could use the conventional forces to augment

1252
02:22:36.28 --> 02:22:41.96
and not as guards for our bases because we don't need those we got the Afghans to do that

1253
02:22:41.96 --> 02:22:47.64
but just as additional people and we can train them on how to do it but and then we can

1254
02:22:47.64 --> 02:22:51.72
expand ourselves because we have we have a little bit more people but not too big because we can't get too

1255
02:22:51.72 --> 02:22:57.48
big because then that that gets out of it so he went to the army and got us a battalion

1256
02:22:57.48 --> 02:23:09.96
all right and we used that battalion to augment not every team but certain teams in certain areas

1257
02:23:10.44 --> 02:23:16.84
and it allowed us to expand faster and one of the one of the areas that we needed to do this was

1258
02:23:16.84 --> 02:23:25.56
Kona right and we brought in a guy by the name of Jim Gantt who had relationships with the tribal

1259
02:23:25.56 --> 02:23:34.92
elders out there both in Pakistan and in and in Afghanistan and we gave him the village stability

1260
02:23:34.92 --> 02:23:41.48
operation mission now Gantt worked for me when I was a battalion commander he wrote a paper that

1261
02:23:41.48 --> 02:23:48.20
General Olson or Admoles and really loved in Soty Petrayus and Soty Dovers and they asked Scott Miller

1262
02:23:48.20 --> 02:23:55.96
who was my boss one star then two star Major General Miller who was my boss during this whole time

1263
02:23:55.96 --> 02:24:01.16
and who I worked through in order to get you know village stability operations in Afghan local police

1264
02:24:01.16 --> 02:24:07.64
started and he was pretty brilliant and you know how he got that approved through Karzai and so on

1265
02:24:07.64 --> 02:24:13.08
so forth because everybody was in the international community was very concerned about oh you're

1266
02:24:13.08 --> 02:24:18.68
gonna arm all these guys and then they're gonna create all kinds of humanitarian violations

1267
02:24:18.68 --> 02:24:25.08
are gonna kill people you know Karzai was worried that they would get too strong and take over the

1268
02:24:25.08 --> 02:24:30.28
government you know when you go down there at that level they didn't have those they didn't have

1269
02:24:30.28 --> 02:24:35.48
those aspirations they wanted to control their village they just wanted to live control their village

1270
02:24:35.48 --> 02:24:43.000
have their family get their family educated bringing their crops to market and let

1271
02:24:43.000 --> 02:24:48.92
them right and not have anybody bothered or they they had they had known this is how I need to take

1272
02:24:48.92 --> 02:24:56.12
over Afghanistan because they saw a couple is as big a problem as anything else right so

1273
02:24:57.80 --> 02:25:04.44
yeah but there's people that live in Montana and Wyoming that don't really care what's going

1274
02:25:04.44 --> 02:25:08.52
in Washington DC and they certainly don't want to move there they don't want to move to New York

1275
02:25:08.52 --> 02:25:14.20
they don't want to move to LA they they just want to live in Iraq's exactly and so same

1276
02:25:14.20 --> 02:25:22.20
principle applies and so you know they you know we you know we we took advantage of that and it

1277
02:25:22.20 --> 02:25:32.44
cost us one eighth the amount of money that it cost to make an Afghan police officer or military officer

1278
02:25:32.44 --> 02:25:39.88
or Afghan police officer or army and you didn't need big garrisons right and they walked to work

1279
02:25:40.60 --> 02:25:46.68
so there's no infrastructure right and the ultimate decentralized commander right it really is

1280
02:25:46.68 --> 02:25:53.24
and and you know it was working and they could sustain it you see it wasn't anything they

1281
02:25:53.24 --> 02:26:01.24
couldn't sustain in the long run so and every place was different you know if you saw one

1282
02:26:02.44 --> 02:26:10.52
village stability operation and one Afghan local police in a village well you only saw one right

1283
02:26:10.52 --> 02:26:18.68
because they're all different right and they're different because you know different people are

1284
02:26:18.68 --> 02:26:24.36
making it work right and the tribes are different and the ideas are different you go up north

1285
02:26:24.36 --> 02:26:29.16
and terrains different the way they're making a living is different yes everything's different so

1286
02:26:29.96 --> 02:26:35.40
you've seen one you've seen one so there there there there isn't this there isn't this like

1287
02:26:35.40 --> 02:26:42.20
you know magic formula where you you know you got one and you take that one and you impose it over

1288
02:26:42.20 --> 02:26:50.04
here no all different right and what I really liked was we carved this up into Marsaucterator

1289
02:26:50.04 --> 02:26:55.88
into naval special warfare territory into special forces territory and I would get the same

1290
02:26:55.88 --> 02:27:01.32
guys back all the time right they would they would come in for the six months they would out rotate

1291
02:27:01.32 --> 02:27:08.04
out in the six months and we got that kind of continuity right and we weren't reinventing the wheel

1292
02:27:08.04 --> 02:27:14.36
where you know special forces are coming in it happened every once in a while and I remember

1293
02:27:15.32 --> 02:27:22.44
when I took command a siege of Sotifei we were coming up let's see this was April I said hey listen

1294
02:27:22.44 --> 02:27:28.92
I walk into this headquarters and I see all these liqueens and chewys and all this all these condiments

1295
02:27:28.92 --> 02:27:34.52
and ice cream and all this other stuff and I go hey fuck guys on the ground can't have this

1296
02:27:34.52 --> 02:27:40.20
one on having and that's just the way it is right and let's talk about Thanksgiving and let's

1297
02:27:40.20 --> 02:27:47.56
talk about Thanksgiving right now let's April if they don't get turkey we don't get turkey right

1298
02:27:48.84 --> 02:27:56.60
and we had the technology we had refrigeration units we could put out there not not tax anything

1299
02:27:56.60 --> 02:28:03.80
we had stuff that would run off of with those panels what am I having so we're paying

1300
02:28:03.80 --> 02:28:10.92
solar panels we had all kinds of stuff and we could you know there was all kinds of innovative ways

1301
02:28:10.92 --> 02:28:15.24
that we could get turkey out to them now some guys get the frozen butterballs they put them in the

1302
02:28:15.24 --> 02:28:19.64
freezers and they were good to go but what about those that we couldn't get that stuff out to

1303
02:28:20.52 --> 02:28:27.24
well I had this I looked at Ron Reagan my my a log guy and I said hey you got to make this happen

1304
02:28:27.24 --> 02:28:33.88
and he goes all right we'll get it happen so Julia Furman at the time at a young lieutenant

1305
02:28:34.84 --> 02:28:43.72
log officer comes up with this plan and she goes sir we got it think we're going to be able to meet

1306
02:28:43.72 --> 02:28:50.04
your intent for Thanksgiving and I go all right well let's let's get it operation turkey drop

1307
02:28:50.04 --> 02:29:02.76
and our our guys figured out how to drop live turkeys in and I said okay is this going to be

1308
02:29:02.76 --> 02:29:08.60
cost prohibitive or what and they go oh no it's it's great we we do it with the normal runs but we just

1309
02:29:08.60 --> 02:29:16.28
you know we got our own shoots we pack our own stuff we've done several rehearsals we haven't had any

1310
02:29:16.28 --> 02:29:23.000
misfires so I'm not going to get in trouble with pita by dropping in a turkey and the turkey you

1311
02:29:23.000 --> 02:29:29.000
know the parachute doesn't you know I was just kidding of course and and so we did it we did

1312
02:29:29.000 --> 02:29:33.80
operation turkey drop we got them out there in September all the turkeys because we had to drop

1313
02:29:33.80 --> 02:29:39.24
grain and feed and you know we had tell them how to take care of the turkeys and so they did it

1314
02:29:39.24 --> 02:29:45.48
and on Thanksgiving day I got all kinds of storyboards right of these guys eating their turkeys

1315
02:29:45.48 --> 02:29:50.68
everyone's happy our guys are happy because they get turkey and all the fixings went out there with it right

1316
02:29:50.68 --> 02:29:57.80
I mean boxes of stove top stuff and then you know all that good stuff right and so these guys are

1317
02:29:57.80 --> 02:30:05.08
eating that stuff well come January I happen to roll out to our one of the marine attachments out there

1318
02:30:05.08 --> 02:30:09.96
and at the time the young captain there was the son of the common don of the Marine Corps

1319
02:30:09.96 --> 02:30:16.92
and I was going to go out to see him and I land on the ground and dust settles and the next thing

1320
02:30:16.92 --> 02:30:23.96
I know I got these two humongous turkeys on each side of us and I go with the heck of these guys

1321
02:30:23.96 --> 02:30:28.76
doing out here and he goes because all those are those are our turkeys you know I go these

1322
02:30:28.76 --> 02:30:35.24
are the same turkeys that we've dropped to you and he goes yeah yeah and he wants to get off the

1323
02:30:35.24 --> 02:30:40.68
subject as fast as he possibly can't but these turkeys are snuggling up right next to me and he told

1324
02:30:40.68 --> 02:30:46.68
me what their names were you know they're true and yeah and I we continue to walk and we close

1325
02:30:46.68 --> 02:30:52.12
to we get to the rains the turkeys break off and they go into this tent that's got and I walk over

1326
02:30:52.12 --> 02:30:56.04
the and they go no no no sir it's this way and I go no I'm going to see what the turkeys are doing

1327
02:30:56.04 --> 02:31:01.48
the farmer and me is now very interested so I go over to see these turkeys and they got this like

1328
02:31:01.48 --> 02:31:09.24
they got they're hooked up they got hey and you know placed to eat drink and tables that they

1329
02:31:09.24 --> 02:31:16.20
jump up on and all these things and I go what's going on he goes he goes oh sir and he's looking

1330
02:31:16.20 --> 02:31:24.76
down at his feet he goes the guys they got the turkeys out here they named him the guys just fell in

1331
02:31:24.76 --> 02:31:29.96
love them and they couldn't kill them and I go you steal the eyed marine special operator

1332
02:31:29.96 --> 02:31:36.92
just couldn't take two turkeys down for Thanksgiving we couldn't do it and I go all right this is

1333
02:31:36.92 --> 02:31:46.44
great and I said hey I don't blame you you know I I get it and but he goes you know the afghan

1334
02:31:46.44 --> 02:31:51.32
are waiting for the day they're waiting for the day yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

1335
02:31:51.88 --> 02:31:58.60
and so a special forces ODA which I was getting my point is we didn't always have the

1336
02:31:58.60 --> 02:32:07.32
flexibility of replacing marines with marines and so on and so forth but SF ODA gets out there

1337
02:32:08.28 --> 02:32:14.60
and that next Sunday I got a story board and they're eating the two turkeys they didn't have the

1338
02:32:14.60 --> 02:32:23.000
same connection with those turkeys and the afghans the cooks they're all smiling you know they got

1339
02:32:23.000 --> 02:32:32.12
there you know they're all happy but anyways then sir you were in that tour for 22 months you're

1340
02:32:32.12 --> 02:32:37.72
over there in afghanistan and then what what what happens when you get no without so I get done

1341
02:32:37.72 --> 02:32:42.20
with that and they say hey you're gonna go to the joint staff and you're gonna be the deputy

1342
02:32:42.20 --> 02:32:52.76
deputy special operations guy in the joint staff and I'll be working for General Magata

1343
02:32:53.88 --> 02:33:04.36
now the the the the VSO idea seemed to have faded and and lost some of its steam not so much

1344
02:33:04.36 --> 02:33:08.12
from what was happening in the field but it seemed like we went in a different direction

1345
02:33:08.12 --> 02:33:13.64
mm-hmm yeah what what caused that well when I got back so I went to the joint staff

1346
02:33:14.44 --> 02:33:23.32
reported there in June of 2011 worked on the staff and there was emphasis taken off of

1347
02:33:23.32 --> 02:33:34.20
village stability operations in afghan local police from 2011 to 12 but I got told hey you know

1348
02:33:34.20 --> 02:33:44.68
General or Admiral McCraven was now the so-called commander and General Allen was the commander

1349
02:33:44.68 --> 02:33:51.16
in afghanistan and they wanted more emphasis placed on VSO so I got told that I would be going

1350
02:33:51.16 --> 02:34:00.36
back in June of 2012 to June of 2003 it's gonna be a year anyways and they said hey and

1351
02:34:00.36 --> 02:34:05.88
Tony Thomas was gonna be the commander there to start commander and I was gonna be the one star

1352
02:34:05.88 --> 02:34:16.60
sipsock a commander with the portfolio for VSO L.P and I'll think of his name as we go but

1353
02:34:16.60 --> 02:34:23.32
Air Force one star I was still a Colonel I hadn't come out on the O.O. seven list yet

1354
02:34:23.32 --> 02:34:33.80
but the one star was gonna work as a deputy for General Thomas and he was gonna do all the

1355
02:34:33.80 --> 02:34:40.44
direct action stuff mm-hmm so two portfolios one commander bringing soft under one command

1356
02:34:40.44 --> 02:34:50.20
and you know Tony Thomas got that and so we went in there under that construct and and I was

1357
02:34:50.20 --> 02:34:59.000
told get this back online get it expanded yet so we did that and by the by June of 2013

1358
02:34:59.000 --> 02:35:11.72
90% of the 90% of the rural area was in the control of the afghan government

1359
02:35:13.64 --> 02:35:18.76
and it was due to village stability operations afghan local police and

1360
02:35:18.76 --> 02:35:25.96
we started doing transitions so we were transitioning to the afghans they had put a

1361
02:35:27.80 --> 02:35:32.60
General Ahmed Zai became my battle buddy and he was in charge

1362
02:35:33.80 --> 02:35:44.36
of the afghan local police for the minister of interior and and so he was my battle buddy and I

1363
02:35:44.36 --> 02:35:51.80
worked with him to ensure that he could he understood and could implement this mission everything

1364
02:35:51.80 --> 02:35:55.96
from you know making sure they got the training make sure they got the weapons make sure they

1365
02:35:55.96 --> 02:36:00.20
got the oversight make sure they got you know they're doing everything they possibly can and it was

1366
02:36:00.20 --> 02:36:07.24
integrated into the afghan government fully and 100% and we were out and we had this on a timeline

1367
02:36:07.24 --> 02:36:13.96
that took us out about you know 2015 maybe 2016 and we would had completely transitioned it and by that

1368
02:36:13.96 --> 02:36:19.56
time nearly 100% of afghan understand would have been fully another control of the of the afghan

1369
02:36:19.56 --> 02:36:29.000
government the Taliban at the time were saying more done al-Qaeda out no they were completely

1370
02:36:29.000 --> 02:36:33.88
ineffective again same thing I was talking about earlier they don't have the they don't have

1371
02:36:33.88 --> 02:36:40.76
the resources to be in every single village and get down to some local village with 280 people

1372
02:36:40.76 --> 02:36:47.16
in it and and put the resources against it to get control of it and it's always better will on it

1373
02:36:47.16 --> 02:36:52.28
and meanwhile the locals obviously they live there not going anywhere and there's more of them

1374
02:36:52.28 --> 02:36:58.68
than there are the Taliban capability built to do it so it was you know it was just

1375
02:36:58.68 --> 02:37:04.04
who's heading in a good direction was heading in a very very very good direction and so

1376
02:37:04.04 --> 02:37:13.16
you know by by the middle of by the middle of 2013 and everything was you know falling into

1377
02:37:13.16 --> 02:37:19.48
place to where the afghans and none of the things that they said you know it wasn't a perfect

1378
02:37:20.28 --> 02:37:26.12
perfect program but what program is perfect it was good enough right and it was working

1379
02:37:26.12 --> 02:37:33.000
and a lot of the things that people really had a problem with just didn't happen right the

1380
02:37:34.28 --> 02:37:41.96
humanitarian you know incidents didn't occur to the extent that people said they were going to

1381
02:37:41.96 --> 02:37:48.68
occur and the you know cars I was not concerned the afghan local police were going to form

1382
02:37:49.72 --> 02:37:55.16
you know a huge militia and assault Kabul it's just one gonna happen right all these things that they

1383
02:37:55.16 --> 02:38:03.40
at the political level they were really nervous about just didn't happen and so I mean it was good right

1384
02:38:04.60 --> 02:38:09.16
and then you know it's it's it's 2013 and people are wondering hey you know when we're going to

1385
02:38:09.16 --> 02:38:15.000
get out of there and so you know the political stuff started you know filtering in afghanistan and

1386
02:38:15.000 --> 02:38:21.72
and you know the ideas of pulling out and so on so forth by 2014 and transitioning

1387
02:38:21.72 --> 02:38:31.96
to non-combat operations coming out of the villages and stuff like that and so we tried to influence

1388
02:38:31.96 --> 02:38:38.92
that the best we could with you know Rand studies and showing them that hey if we just keep this for a

1389
02:38:38.92 --> 02:38:47.56
couple more years you know it's gonna be solid and the chance for resurgence will be way low and I mean

1390
02:38:47.56 --> 02:38:54.20
look what we've done in terms of the dropping casualties you know lowering a casualties a record

1391
02:38:54.20 --> 02:39:02.92
lows record highs and security the Taliban are pretty much slapping the table on defeat alkate

1392
02:39:02.92 --> 02:39:07.88
is like hey we can't operate here anymore and that had a lot of due at the top down stuff going

1393
02:39:07.88 --> 02:39:12.68
on too because you needed that right so you know the tier one guys weren't involved in the village

1394
02:39:12.68 --> 02:39:17.48
stability operations afghan local police but what they were doing to take out the senior

1395
02:39:17.48 --> 02:39:24.84
guys was obviously complimentary right so this was good this was a good balance and it was

1396
02:39:24.84 --> 02:39:31.48
soft was in a good place where we were all working together and we were doing a variety of

1397
02:39:31.48 --> 02:39:39.56
different missions along our very broad mission continuum and it was way less expensive than

1398
02:39:39.56 --> 02:39:46.68
sending over a division or a brigade to do it right you know did it keep soft busy yeah it kept soft

1399
02:39:46.68 --> 02:39:54.20
busy but you know I mean in a productive way and the guys saw it right I mean not everybody

1400
02:39:54.20 --> 02:39:58.92
you know even our guys weren't in love with the mission first you know I mean you talk about it in

1401
02:39:58.92 --> 02:40:05.16
your book you know about having to explain the guys that it's gonna have to be an Iraqi solution

1402
02:40:05.16 --> 02:40:09.80
of this right and we're gonna have you know and it was the same challenges I had right

1403
02:40:09.80 --> 02:40:14.28
no guys we're not gonna be kicking indoors the afghan's gonna kick indoors probably but

1404
02:40:14.28 --> 02:40:20.52
you're not gonna kick in any doors and if you do well that's an extreme right but you got to

1405
02:40:20.52 --> 02:40:24.68
work through with and buy these guys they're the ones that have to own it the end of the day and so

1406
02:40:24.68 --> 02:40:30.60
we went to the same thought process but the guys realized that this was still a combat mission

1407
02:40:30.60 --> 02:40:39.000
that this was not a man-be-pambi kind of hand-ringing humanitarian thing it was a combat mission

1408
02:40:39.000 --> 02:40:49.72
and and so you know they got I mean they they they really they really made it work without them

1409
02:40:49.72 --> 02:40:59.08
no way wouldn't have happened and so yeah so you start hearing this and we're getting concerned

1410
02:40:59.08 --> 02:41:05.000
and and the concern is about a drawdown coming drawdown coming right changing from a combat

1411
02:41:05.000 --> 02:41:11.96
operations to non-combat operations coming out of the village villages too early handing this

1412
02:41:11.96 --> 02:41:21.64
program lock stock and barrel over to the afghan's at the senior level too early and you know

1413
02:41:21.64 --> 02:41:29.24
we gave him the warnings we said hey likely the security situation will reverse likely the

1414
02:41:29.24 --> 02:41:40.84
they'll be a resurgence and al-Qaeda will come back right well nobody thought that ISIS would

1415
02:41:40.84 --> 02:41:47.32
come back but by 2016 we had a complete reversal because we did they made the decision they

1416
02:41:47.32 --> 02:41:53.48
slapped a table we came out of the villages we went strictly top down we put all our emphasis on

1417
02:41:53.48 --> 02:42:01.48
the afghan national army impolice to fight and gain security we didn't support the afghan

1418
02:42:01.48 --> 02:42:10.52
local police program anymore and fell you know fell apart and I think it could have been

1419
02:42:10.52 --> 02:42:14.44
avoidable I think a lot of other people who have done assessments on it not it could have been

1420
02:42:14.44 --> 02:42:21.08
avoidable but nonetheless you know our guys on the ground regardless of what mission you give them

1421
02:42:21.08 --> 02:42:29.88
still do it was honor integrity and they get done what you want them to get done but

1422
02:42:30.68 --> 02:42:40.92
at the end of the day we saw ISIS come back we saw Kada emerge we saw Merge we saw

1423
02:42:42.20 --> 02:42:48.68
Taliban come back and full force the security situation was reversed and we had an all-time

1424
02:42:48.68 --> 02:43:03.08
high in casualties in 2019 so here we are in 2021 and you know President Trump I think had

1425
02:43:03.08 --> 02:43:09.08
the right idea let's figure out how we can come out of afghanistan well nobody gave him a plan

1426
02:43:09.08 --> 02:43:14.44
right when he asked for it two years into administration just didn't have plan to come out so

1427
02:43:14.44 --> 02:43:23.32
you know hey the political situation you know overcomes everything right going into a presidential

1428
02:43:23.32 --> 02:43:30.84
election year a big year for the congress you know and that starts driving decision making

1429
02:43:30.84 --> 02:43:36.20
start driving decision making and really instead of the guys on the ground right exactly and so

1430
02:43:36.20 --> 02:43:47.72
here we go and you know the president was response of the current president who's got to make a

1431
02:43:47.72 --> 02:43:54.76
decision right I mean it is what it is but he was also in charge of when he was vice president

1432
02:43:55.40 --> 02:44:02.12
you know coming out of Iraq in 2011 and going to zero and you know he he just used I think

1433
02:44:02.12 --> 02:44:07.24
what he learned there and the experience he had there and applied it to Afghanistan and boom

1434
02:44:07.24 --> 02:44:16.12
you know we're out lock stock in barrel and we although I am an advocate of you know figuring

1435
02:44:16.12 --> 02:44:20.20
out how to come out of there I'm more of an advocate of coming out of there the right way

1436
02:44:20.92 --> 02:44:26.20
and there's a lot to lose there particularly I mean I'm signing a lot of letters today

1437
02:44:26.20 --> 02:44:32.52
from 20 years of working with people there in Afghanistan and interpreters and workers

1438
02:44:32.52 --> 02:44:38.20
barbers you know guys you know gardeners guys that really put their life on the line

1439
02:44:39.72 --> 02:44:46.92
to support us and to help us them and their families and now they're left there and and so

1440
02:44:47.32 --> 02:44:55.000
I think I got 45 letters signed right now and I send everything I do to congressman Krenshaw

1441
02:44:55.000 --> 02:45:01.000
and Tom Cotton because they're you know they're putting together some sort of process to expedite

1442
02:45:01.000 --> 02:45:13.32
getting these guys out of there but you know it's a everything's political right and you know

1443
02:45:13.32 --> 02:45:21.72
we just we're you know we're at a point in time now where you know strategy and policy

1444
02:45:21.72 --> 02:45:27.96
and security inside our country and outside our country is is you know I mean I think it's an

1445
02:45:27.96 --> 02:45:35.000
issue I think a lot of Americans see this is an issue right and yeah well especially when we

1446
02:45:35.000 --> 02:45:40.36
see the other you know nation states that are making moves big moves and playing long playing the

1447
02:45:40.36 --> 02:45:45.08
long strategic game and we're looking to the next election that's our long strategic game sometimes

1448
02:45:45.08 --> 02:45:50.04
yeah right now 2022 is our long strategic game right I mean how are we gonna change the house

1449
02:45:50.04 --> 02:45:54.60
and how are we gonna change the Senate and how are we gonna get the majority there not so much

1450
02:45:54.60 --> 02:45:59.72
and how we're gonna deal with China and and how we're gonna deal with the potential

1451
02:45:59.72 --> 02:46:04.92
invasion of Taiwan and how we're gonna deal with Russia and their encroachment on the Crimea

1452
02:46:04.92 --> 02:46:13.32
and Europe and and their pipeline issues and and Iran and and you know their proxy war

1453
02:46:13.32 --> 02:46:18.92
and what they're gonna do against Israel and North Korea is gonna follow China everywhere it

1454
02:46:18.92 --> 02:46:25.000
goes and now it's working more on its nuclear program that it ever has been and we got you know

1455
02:46:25.000 --> 02:46:32.28
no visibility on that and and those are some existential threats that we really got to pay attention

1456
02:46:32.28 --> 02:46:38.60
and the real and the real and we got Africa right 28 countries in Africa that are just getting

1457
02:46:38.60 --> 02:46:44.36
eaten alive by China and Russia you get eaten alive by terrorist organizations that are taking

1458
02:46:44.36 --> 02:46:50.44
advantage of the ungoverned spaces and that's dangerous for Europe you know the French and the

1459
02:46:50.44 --> 02:46:57.72
British and the Dutch and the Germans and the Italians the front line for the for the war against

1460
02:46:57.72 --> 02:47:04.52
violent extremist organizations is in Africa for them you know it's mully it's Libya it's Tunisia

1461
02:47:06.04 --> 02:47:13.88
and it's Kenya and it's uh Somalia and it's Nigeria and it's Senegal and Martania

1462
02:47:13.88 --> 02:47:20.52
and Morocco you know it's all these different places right and you know I mean I spent four years

1463
02:47:20.52 --> 02:47:27.40
in in US Africa and two years 26 months and that was commanding special operations command in Africa

1464
02:47:27.40 --> 02:47:35.08
and we had 28 countries over 2000 special ops troops on the ground advising assisting training

1465
02:47:35.08 --> 02:47:41.96
and conducting operations through with and by our partners to get after al Shibab right

1466
02:47:41.96 --> 02:47:49.24
some of ISIS Somalia right out in the East there Central Africa the Lord's Resistance Army and

1467
02:47:49.24 --> 02:47:58.04
now ISIS is there and Nigeria would bokeh her arm in ISIS West Africa and and and Chad and Cameroon

1468
02:47:58.04 --> 02:48:06.28
and Pekingafaso and Mauritania and Senegal and and all of the affiliates of al-Qaeda that are out

1469
02:48:06.28 --> 02:48:11.72
there reap and havoc right the French have over 4,000 troops on the ground and you know from

1470
02:48:11.72 --> 02:48:18.52
mully to Nigeria because it's their war it's their front line right and you have a huge coalition of

1471
02:48:18.52 --> 02:48:24.20
you know of European partners there I mean I dealt more with our European partners

1472
02:48:24.20 --> 02:48:31.32
than special operations command Europe did because they're fighting in Africa right and so I was

1473
02:48:31.32 --> 02:48:37.88
always you know coordinate with Mark Schwartz a Mark I'm going to I'm going to Denmark I'm going

1474
02:48:37.88 --> 02:48:43.80
here I'm going there you know I I went to French five times right to talk to the highest levels

1475
02:48:43.80 --> 02:48:52.68
of their government about you know what was going on there and you know so what was going on in

1476
02:48:52.68 --> 02:49:01.16
Africa is is something that America's taking its eye off of and 1.4 billion people by 2050 it

1477
02:49:01.16 --> 02:49:07.80
will be 2.4 billion people and incredible it's in resources there incredible amount of resources

1478
02:49:07.80 --> 02:49:14.52
huge and what goes through South America into the United States you know South America is

1479
02:49:15.40 --> 02:49:20.52
not very far from the African West coast and you got all those traditional lines of illicit

1480
02:49:20.52 --> 02:49:26.52
trafficking that go through Europe the Iranians have multiple have been able to establish

1481
02:49:26.52 --> 02:49:32.60
multiple places where they have infiltrated Africa all over Africa to move men weapons and

1482
02:49:32.60 --> 02:49:41.24
resources at a drop of the hat if they need to so I mean we got other problems out there you know

1483
02:49:41.24 --> 02:49:48.12
we have to keep our eye on it and Afghanistan we shouldn't be tied to one country but we got tied

1484
02:49:48.12 --> 02:49:54.44
to that country there was a good way to go out but moving to a regional perspective with everything

1485
02:49:54.44 --> 02:50:01.08
going on in that region is a whole heck of a lot smarter and you know we just need to start considering

1486
02:50:01.08 --> 02:50:06.44
that but we I still think we have some responsibilities to Afghanistan that we kind of overlooked in our

1487
02:50:08.52 --> 02:50:16.68
in our exit there you know you know you you're looking at the global perspective and the global

1488
02:50:16.68 --> 02:50:21.16
issues clearly that's that's all stuff we have to think about but I know that there's one more issue

1489
02:50:21.16 --> 02:50:28.84
that you've dealt with personally and you've tried to help out our troops with it and that's

1490
02:50:28.84 --> 02:50:32.76
what's going on and what happens to our troops and what's happened to our troops well I guess

1491
02:50:32.76 --> 02:50:37.80
as long as we've been around but we've definitely noticed it for sure since these wars kicked off

1492
02:50:37.80 --> 02:50:45.08
the war on terror kicked off and that's a post traumatic stress and then the traumatic brain injuries

1493
02:50:45.08 --> 02:50:52.44
what was your how how how did you address that how did you experience that what was that

1494
02:50:52.44 --> 02:50:56.44
like for you and I know we've been talking for a while but I wanted to cover this because I mean this

1495
02:50:56.44 --> 02:51:01.64
is something that a lot of people are are dealing with yes well I think it's the number one

1496
02:51:01.64 --> 02:51:06.04
health issue that we have in the United States military today and I believe it's the same

1497
02:51:06.04 --> 02:51:13.32
when you look at our veterans and it's leading to the significant amount of suicides and both on

1498
02:51:13.32 --> 02:51:25.08
active duty in the reserves national guard and and again and better in community right and I think

1499
02:51:25.08 --> 02:51:31.08
it's all has to do a dismantle injury issue and physical injury and spiritual injury and

1500
02:51:31.08 --> 02:51:36.76
it's that triad that I think is hugely important that we have to work on strengthening all the

1501
02:51:36.76 --> 02:51:43.000
time in the military because you know as well as I do if you're physically hurting you need

1502
02:51:43.000 --> 02:51:50.60
that taken care of and mental injuries right you need that taken care of and we know by studying

1503
02:51:51.48 --> 02:51:58.36
all the way back to to Sparta right that the traumatic brain injury and post traumatic

1504
02:51:58.36 --> 02:52:02.84
stress was something that they looked at they didn't call it that right but they knew that a

1505
02:52:02.84 --> 02:52:07.56
concoct on the head created problems right and they and they manifested themselves and they

1506
02:52:07.56 --> 02:52:14.04
inside their their their units their military units and they they realize that they had a

1507
02:52:14.84 --> 02:52:19.56
an obligation right and an ancient Sparta there's only two people to get their name on a headstown

1508
02:52:20.12 --> 02:52:26.36
a mother who get who dies in childbirth and a warrior that dies in a battlefield everybody else is

1509
02:52:26.36 --> 02:52:36.20
buried in Sparta with no name, no nothing but the birth of a child and the sacrifice in the

1510
02:52:36.20 --> 02:52:40.92
battlefield the ultimate sacrifice on a battlefield are recognized in that warrior culture so

1511
02:52:41.96 --> 02:52:45.96
when we look back and we see everything that we've done and what we've called it throughout the years

1512
02:52:47.24 --> 02:52:53.56
and and I was one that didn't have an appreciation for it either right I thought it was a

1513
02:52:53.56 --> 02:52:59.72
sign of weakness right there's no way right I mean you know you think about pattern and you think

1514
02:52:59.72 --> 02:53:07.16
about you know the way our society has shaped us and I thought it was weakness as well until

1515
02:53:09.000 --> 02:53:14.84
it happened to me until I started happening others until I realized what's the problem and you know

1516
02:53:14.84 --> 02:53:21.56
who educated me on this my wife she's a nurse she started studying it she started seeing it she

1517
02:53:21.56 --> 02:53:26.76
started seeing how I changed every time I came back and when you get more comfortable

1518
02:53:26.76 --> 02:53:33.56
being away from your family and deployed in a combat zone and you do it home with your family

1519
02:53:34.20 --> 02:53:41.08
you got a problem and that was me and it was affecting my relationships with you know my family

1520
02:53:41.08 --> 02:53:50.12
it was affecting relationships in the military I was always you know wired for sound

1521
02:53:50.92 --> 02:53:55.40
go high and right really quick and who's my temper and not want to listen to people and it just

1522
02:53:55.40 --> 02:54:00.84
negatively affected everything right and she started noticing around 2008 and she was talking to me

1523
02:54:00.84 --> 02:54:05.96
about getting help well it was no getting going for help 2008 and the military that right now

1524
02:54:06.68 --> 02:54:12.20
in 2010 you started seeing programs and they were starting to deal with traumatic brain injury

1525
02:54:12.20 --> 02:54:18.20
but I'm telling you we have all these programs but what I learned was our approaches were on

1526
02:54:18.20 --> 02:54:22.92
right our our our approaches punitive we're going to take you off your team

1527
02:54:22.92 --> 02:54:27.48
we take you away from the people at the law the people that you want to be with every single day

1528
02:54:27.48 --> 02:54:32.12
and we're going to put you over here and we're going to say okay you're not going to do your duty

1529
02:54:32.12 --> 02:54:39.16
you're not going to do your job and and oh by the way we're going to take you clearance away

1530
02:54:39.16 --> 02:54:46.52
or suspended whatever and if you don't get better in a year we're going to process you out of the

1531
02:54:46.52 --> 02:54:54.28
army I mean that's a TOD policy right and I thought that was insane well by 2013

1532
02:54:56.68 --> 02:55:03.72
I had just been promoted Brigadier General I just got to US Africa US Africa just started my job

1533
02:55:03.72 --> 02:55:09.64
as the operations officer there and just what my wife came to me and she said we can't handle it anymore

1534
02:55:09.64 --> 02:55:15.88
I can't handle it kids can't handle it your dog can't handle it you know contact our husky at the time

1535
02:55:17.72 --> 02:55:22.28
she goes you got to do something I got a draw line here she goes

1536
02:55:24.60 --> 02:55:31.64
and I said you're right you're right and she's talking about losing your temper not being around

1537
02:55:31.64 --> 02:55:38.12
social the isolating myself staying at work till ungodly hours just avoiding avoiding social events

1538
02:55:38.12 --> 02:55:48.44
you know the my biggest fear was having to go to a social event right and I would look for

1539
02:55:48.44 --> 02:55:55.88
every single excuse under the sun yep I'm going I'm going I'm going until I call her I'm saying

1540
02:55:55.88 --> 02:56:02.12
hey something came up at work I need to stay with right check and I would go home right after the event

1541
02:56:02.12 --> 02:56:13.96
was done so and she's not dumb she knows exactly what I was doing right and but she knew it was delicate right

1542
02:56:13.96 --> 02:56:22.92
and and you know I wasn't a screamer at home I would just not involve myself anything right

1543
02:56:22.92 --> 02:56:31.000
just come home and mind my own damn business not getting involved and that was that and you know

1544
02:56:32.68 --> 02:56:41.000
if something came up I would exit stage right and avoid dealing with you know and then I would look for

1545
02:56:41.000 --> 02:56:47.56
every opportunity I could to go to play somewhere right well when I went to US African that ability to

1546
02:56:47.56 --> 02:56:53.64
play went away because as the operations officer US African the only place I was deployed to was my

1547
02:56:53.64 --> 02:57:03.72
office right that was it yeah so 2013 she got me to go but I had heard about this nurse Sarah McNary

1548
02:57:04.76 --> 02:57:11.08
who had was up at launch to when she's really innovative and so I went up and I had a meeting

1549
02:57:11.08 --> 02:57:17.56
with her and I said listen you know I got to do this under the radar right I mean this is not

1550
02:57:17.56 --> 02:57:24.84
something it would be accepted by the chain of command if I'm going for PTSD of help so she understood and

1551
02:57:26.60 --> 02:57:33.32
she put me on a program I went up and it was easy for me to get away right we had African units

1552
02:57:33.32 --> 02:57:43.24
up at launch tool you know Ramstein near launch tool and I could I could always find a way to get

1553
02:57:43.24 --> 02:57:47.88
up there if I needed to go for an appointment or what have you so it wasn't a big one of the big

1554
02:57:47.88 --> 02:57:53.08
stretch and it didn't put a lot of light on what I was doing but I went up there in three days

1555
02:57:55.80 --> 02:58:01.000
got a value of post-matic stress TBI sweep disorder pain management issues

1556
02:58:01.000 --> 02:58:11.24
neuro toxicity and there was all positive right I mean all the malaria medications and the

1557
02:58:11.24 --> 02:58:17.72
vaccines and all these things that we've done all our career all our life it was my kidneys my you know

1558
02:58:19.16 --> 02:58:27.24
other organs the way your brain thinks it's on so forth all that positive PTSD positive

1559
02:58:27.24 --> 02:58:34.12
more important I got put on therapy programs right and so I took advantage of this and I did it

1560
02:58:34.12 --> 02:58:44.60
religiously from 2013 through 2015 I managed to go through this and then I looked at myself in the

1561
02:58:44.60 --> 02:58:50.20
mirror what are the therapy programs consist of so is this like sitting down talking with someone is this

1562
02:58:50.20 --> 02:58:57.40
yes so they give you a bunch of tests for PTSD right and they figure out exactly what's you know what's

1563
02:58:57.40 --> 02:59:04.04
wrong with your you know with your brain and you know we're you're thinking and how

1564
02:59:06.04 --> 02:59:12.52
social isolation is impacting you and you know and they put you with a therapist and they work on

1565
02:59:12.52 --> 02:59:22.60
those those things you you talk about it you come up with strategies to overcome it you you

1566
02:59:22.60 --> 02:59:27.80
my wife came with me that was hugely important because you know she's got there's a quote

1567
02:59:30.12 --> 02:59:39.88
above my doctors on my doctors office there in launch tool because my wife was with me and he asked

1568
02:59:39.88 --> 02:59:47.88
me a question and I told him to my answer and she goes that's a bunch of bullshit because she

1569
02:59:47.88 --> 02:59:55.72
know so he goes oh yeah what's the real deal right and so I realized the utility in that because

1570
02:59:56.36 --> 03:00:00.52
sometimes we're embarrassed by our actions right and we don't want to fully disclose them well

1571
03:00:00.52 --> 03:00:04.84
if you don't fully disclose then people aren't going to really understand how to help you and

1572
03:00:04.84 --> 03:00:13.64
and when I had to travel and I had an appointment I did it by Skype and so I's the TBI had

1573
03:00:13.64 --> 03:00:19.56
serious balance issues my eyes were out of focus and there's a machine that they test that on and a

1574
03:00:19.56 --> 03:00:25.88
machine that they fix it on so my eyes got back into balance and my balance got they put you on

1575
03:00:25.88 --> 03:00:33.16
a balance machine and you know you feel like an idiot and and I did all my balance exercises my

1576
03:00:33.16 --> 03:00:37.72
balance got good you know there was I'd go for a walk with my wife we'd hold hands and I would you know

1577
03:00:37.72 --> 03:00:44.04
I'm here off to the right and she's like hey you're killing me right and she pushed me back over

1578
03:00:44.04 --> 03:00:49.24
and so on and so forth and so they just have all these strategies to fix here now think about it

1579
03:00:49.24 --> 03:00:55.88
you got traumatic brain injury as a special operator and your balance is on and your eye focus is on

1580
03:00:55.88 --> 03:01:05.80
and you're going to do a you know high risk CH MH 47 infiltration into a village and and then

1581
03:01:05.80 --> 03:01:11.80
and then you know fast rope onto a building and then use a ladder to cross from one building to the

1582
03:01:11.80 --> 03:01:17.72
other and your balance sucks right these are things we need to fix but we're not going to be able to fix

1583
03:01:17.72 --> 03:01:24.44
them if we're not aware of them and so I started thinking about what a freaking coward I am doing this

1584
03:01:24.44 --> 03:01:30.36
under the radar and not leading the way and so on and so forth so I went back and I talked to my boss

1585
03:01:30.36 --> 03:01:38.52
about it as the operations officer in Africa and I said hey this is what I've been doing and I am a

1586
03:01:38.52 --> 03:01:45.96
different man my wife sees it my kids see it my dogs see I am different I'm not perfect but I'm

1587
03:01:45.96 --> 03:01:51.64
a better version of myself and he goes yeah I've noticed you've been showing up to our

1588
03:01:51.64 --> 03:01:57.08
our to our social events on Fridays here in Africa and I go oh yeah he goes before you

1589
03:01:57.08 --> 03:02:05.16
wouldn't come near him and he goes he goes that's good all right because I get it nice that I'm

1590
03:02:05.16 --> 03:02:10.76
going to open it up to guys in the in the in the J3 and I did and I got them all together and I

1591
03:02:10.76 --> 03:02:15.40
talked to them and I laid it all out and I told them what I was doing and I said I'm a freaking coward

1592
03:02:15.40 --> 03:02:20.68
but I tell you what I'll do right now is you won't take it taken out of your job you won't get

1593
03:02:20.68 --> 03:02:27.16
taken you won't lose your clearance I will back you up 100% I don't care if it is DOD policy they

1594
03:02:27.16 --> 03:02:33.24
I don't care it's not the right approach so I got your back we did it and I'm telling you a lot

1595
03:02:33.24 --> 03:02:38.20
of guys you know I carried that over when I took command of special operations command in Africa

1596
03:02:38.20 --> 03:02:48.20
on 24 April and I got with them unbelievable 26 months at that what I thought were

1597
03:02:48.20 --> 03:02:58.44
in discipline issues without go home and drugs was self-medication was guys trying to figure out

1598
03:02:58.44 --> 03:03:04.60
how they're going to be able to alleviate their pain deal with their issues and still be able to

1599
03:03:04.60 --> 03:03:14.04
do their mission the best of their ability right and in in South Africa we put even the deploying

1600
03:03:14.04 --> 03:03:22.12
troops that came over we put them to the program and it was huge Navy SEALs marine special

1601
03:03:22.12 --> 03:03:29.80
operators SF Air Force guys we got testimonies from wise marriages that were saved we decentralized

1602
03:03:29.80 --> 03:03:36.36
the program like I remember I was in New Share which we were up in our lit which is

1603
03:03:37.32 --> 03:03:41.08
in the middle of nowhere it's not the end of the world but you can see it from there you know

1604
03:03:41.08 --> 03:03:51.24
I mean and and I did my Skype you know meeting with my therapist right I mean I still see a therapist

1605
03:03:51.24 --> 03:03:56.52
right it's just something that I decided to continue but I'm very high functioning person

1606
03:03:57.08 --> 03:04:01.88
and that was my point these guys are still high functioning and they're even more high functioning

1607
03:04:01.88 --> 03:04:08.28
if we give them the treatment they need it's just a mental injury 52 people we we diagnosed with

1608
03:04:08.28 --> 03:04:21.40
a PTSD 471 with with traumatic brain injury 471 and there's only one guy and you

1609
03:04:21.40 --> 03:04:26.28
and believe on many people with pain management issues right I mean and sleep issues

1610
03:04:26.92 --> 03:04:33.08
we're the definition of a sleeping you know sleep problems yes we are and and so we got

1611
03:04:33.08 --> 03:04:40.04
them the machines or the mouth thing whatever they wanted and it was unbelievable you know if you

1612
03:04:40.04 --> 03:04:48.12
if you get less than five hours of sleep your brain operates like it's got 0.10% alcohol in it

1613
03:04:48.12 --> 03:04:56.52
you know legal limit of driving under the influence so for I don't know 25 years or so I was

1614
03:04:56.52 --> 03:05:02.28
shit faced at work without taking a drop of alcohol you know and and think about your decision

1615
03:05:02.28 --> 03:05:09.40
making and stuff like that and so the New York Times came into the unit and said hey we're going

1616
03:05:09.40 --> 03:05:14.04
to do an article on Africa and then she started talking to people they said that's not the story

1617
03:05:14.60 --> 03:05:19.000
the story is how we're dealing with post traumatic stress and TBI and getting resilience and

1618
03:05:19.000 --> 03:05:23.48
ready to back in the end that story you should get asking about that so she asked me about

1619
03:05:23.48 --> 03:05:30.28
an eye to older and that became the story I wasn't a popular story with a chanic man not a

1620
03:05:30.28 --> 03:05:38.12
popular story at all and I was told to stop talking about it the more you talk about it the more

1621
03:05:38.12 --> 03:05:43.96
problems we have and I said wow I don't agree with that I think the more we talk about it

1622
03:05:43.96 --> 03:05:49.40
I'm all we understand it and the least problems we have and we get guys in the therapy and we can do

1623
03:05:49.40 --> 03:05:56.04
it without degrading the mission I did I had 96 96 missions and special operations command

1624
03:05:56.04 --> 03:06:06.60
and 846 associated tasks and I had zero zero detriment in mission and guys got better I mean

1625
03:06:07.80 --> 03:06:15.16
drug and alcohol abuse you know incidents went way down I went to zero in misappro- you know

1626
03:06:15.16 --> 03:06:22.36
misbehavior in the in the workplace zero right they sent a team from DOD to investigate

1627
03:06:22.36 --> 03:06:27.32
what we were doing right and I said hey it's just a matter of taking care of mental physical

1628
03:06:27.32 --> 03:06:34.84
injuries and spiritual you know so com had a great program that they brought in with that integrated

1629
03:06:34.84 --> 03:06:41.16
families and we had that and we located in our headquarters and that was something that I had nothing

1630
03:06:41.16 --> 03:06:46.76
to do with because the rules are that nothing gets reported to the chanic command and I'm okay

1631
03:06:46.76 --> 03:06:52.52
with that right I don't need to know right guys there with their families working out problems it was

1632
03:06:52.52 --> 03:07:04.20
really unbelievable after 26 months of you know of this and yeah you know that with for me it was

1633
03:07:04.92 --> 03:07:12.76
a whole process of leadership and learning and understanding and then being able to say

1634
03:07:12.76 --> 03:07:21.000
you're strong not weak if you ask for help right and I had three suicides in my unit I

1635
03:07:23.08 --> 03:07:29.72
I'll know if again starting first class in Kenya six month rotation in Kenya combat operations

1636
03:07:29.72 --> 03:07:39.40
with the Kenyan special ops Rangers against elk against alchibob and ISIS Samaria just great work

1637
03:07:39.40 --> 03:07:48.52
packed up all this gear cleaned his quarters ready for standing but I don't know

1638
03:07:50.76 --> 03:07:56.04
day before he was redeploy went out to the range sat in the chair and shot himself and had

1639
03:07:59.32 --> 03:08:04.84
it was more painful him for him to go home at that point in time in his life in his decision making

1640
03:08:04.84 --> 03:08:14.04
process then so he took his life I tell you what man I took a knee on that one you know what

1641
03:08:14.04 --> 03:08:26.68
me I mean a big knee right and so I said we can't we can't allow that to happen you know

1642
03:08:26.68 --> 03:08:36.76
it's bad enough to lose somebody in your unit combat but suicide and of course we missed all kinds

1643
03:08:36.76 --> 03:08:43.16
of warning signals everybody missed one example you know who knew the family knew but the family

1644
03:08:43.16 --> 03:08:50.28
was afraid to talk because they were afraid that if they say anything then it's gonna hurt their

1645
03:08:50.28 --> 03:08:57.88
husband's career and so we need to be better at making sure it doesn't hurt their career make

1646
03:08:57.88 --> 03:09:01.96
sure they get to help because we can do it we get a lot of white space on the counter we guys come

1647
03:09:01.96 --> 03:09:09.000
back and we can make it work and taking these health assessments and gonna work right you got to

1648
03:09:09.000 --> 03:09:15.48
have take these programs and you at the top I'm telling you rich put gliszy who was my senior

1649
03:09:15.48 --> 03:09:21.96
and listed advisor maybe seal great guy love rich I know rich rich and I had the same issues

1650
03:09:21.96 --> 03:09:26.44
and we would get in front of the unit and we would talk and we would share our personal experiences

1651
03:09:27.80 --> 03:09:33.96
and we had it everyone's back the only person that didn't that got taken off was the

1652
03:09:33.96 --> 03:09:41.16
sergeant major of our our uh sipping you know our direct action teams and that's because

1653
03:09:41.16 --> 03:09:47.48
after we talked to him he took all 45 of his guys the next day over at launch tool ran

1654
03:09:47.48 --> 03:09:52.68
him through the program and when he was getting his MRI to see if he had any traumatic rain

1655
03:09:52.68 --> 03:09:59.32
injury they found a tumor about the size of an eraser on his brain he got met

1656
03:09:59.32 --> 03:10:09.08
back to to Walter Reed they took the tumor off they said hey you know if this had gone another year you

1657
03:10:09.08 --> 03:10:17.40
would have been figuring out an end of life plan and they replaced his left hip that he had been

1658
03:10:18.60 --> 03:10:27.64
you know dealing with for years and he was a new man right and an advocate of this whole program

1659
03:10:27.64 --> 03:10:35.56
and you know after he left the team he went off to our training and has been an advocate for this

1660
03:10:35.56 --> 03:10:40.36
and you know promoting it ever since and this is what you get you get guys with a better understanding

1661
03:10:40.36 --> 03:10:48.52
very bottom up but they got to have that top down cover and I'm afraid it's still not there it needs

1662
03:10:48.52 --> 03:10:57.08
to be there we got to put it there and you know I went through the you know what everyone else

1663
03:10:57.08 --> 03:11:09.08
goes through oh I'm weak something wrong with me I'm less of a man and that's none of that's true right

1664
03:11:11.80 --> 03:11:19.16
so that's that was your last tour was was that sock African right that was it you know it was funny

1665
03:11:19.16 --> 03:11:29.48
I joined the army 29 June 1981 and I gave up command and had my retirement ceremony on 29 June

1666
03:11:29.96 --> 03:11:40.92
2017 I didn't retire officially until two August 2017 but you know I came home and went on

1667
03:11:40.92 --> 03:11:50.76
in Terminal League and started helping veterans put together a business called Truth to Power

1668
03:11:50.76 --> 03:11:57.32
which I was doing really well with I'd have about four speaking events a month which was good

1669
03:11:57.32 --> 03:12:02.04
just bringing in the money that I needed then I got hired to be an associate professor at

1670
03:12:02.04 --> 03:12:07.32
New England College and I just got laid off and I was trying to find a job I got laid off and

1671
03:12:07.32 --> 03:12:14.52
made trying to find a job so I ended up applying to Hampton Police Department and I am now a

1672
03:12:14.52 --> 03:12:21.000
at 59 years old a police recruit in the New Hampshire Police Academy I'm the platoon leader

1673
03:12:22.36 --> 03:12:30.92
and my the youngest guy in the class is 19 years old and I'm like holy crap and so

1674
03:12:30.92 --> 03:12:40.52
I'll graduate November November 19th and it was funny because in 1980 I was in class number four

1675
03:12:40.52 --> 03:12:46.04
because remember I told you about me in a police officer and I am now in class 281

1676
03:12:48.36 --> 03:12:55.48
and so yeah I'll start working working at Hampton Police Department which is the town right next to

1677
03:12:55.48 --> 03:13:01.64
stratum where I live now in New Hampshire it's on the seacoast so it's right there on the beach

1678
03:13:01.64 --> 03:13:08.92
and the majority of the work there is patrolling the Hampton Beach area which is which is going to be

1679
03:13:08.92 --> 03:13:17.48
cool and you know it's going to be a high adventure you have to obey watch yeah it's right

1680
03:13:17.48 --> 03:13:25.88
and I you know I mean I've always looked at where I can contribute and I gotta tell you at 59 years old

1681
03:13:25.88 --> 03:13:36.92
when I in its quite a process too because I applied and I got my test date of 3 May and I went

1682
03:13:36.92 --> 03:13:47.000
and took my test with 27 other young guys right and that was the standardized test right so

1683
03:13:47.000 --> 03:13:52.12
I hadn't taken a standard I'd test no 40 years so I was nervous about that right and I took the

1684
03:13:52.12 --> 03:13:57.96
test that I passed much to my dismay and surprised and I got set up for my oral interview

1685
03:13:59.08 --> 03:14:05.48
and I had the lieutenant sergeant in a patrolman and they go all right we know who you are

1686
03:14:05.48 --> 03:14:11.32
we all voted for you right in the last election we all we know who you are and we know what you've

1687
03:14:11.32 --> 03:14:17.56
done for our country why and they held you want to do this and I said hey I just looking for a

1688
03:14:17.56 --> 03:14:25.08
way to contribute and you know there's no more to it than that and he goes okay and the sergeant

1689
03:14:25.08 --> 03:14:32.04
starts asking me questions and it gets to the patrolman he goes I don't have any experience to ask

1690
03:14:32.04 --> 03:14:38.84
you any questions and I said yeah you do your police officers so bring it on but nonetheless you

1691
03:14:38.84 --> 03:14:45.72
know you do the polygraph and you do the physical fitness test and you do the the psychological

1692
03:14:45.72 --> 03:14:50.04
test and it was like going through special ops again you know all those things that lead up

1693
03:14:50.04 --> 03:14:57.16
to you get in you got a qualify physically mentally you know you got to pass the the full physical

1694
03:14:57.16 --> 03:15:06.84
test and I have two prosthetic hips and three prosthetic discs because of combat injuries

1695
03:15:06.84 --> 03:15:12.28
and that was the thing that we're worried about the most right and I said listen I've jumped out

1696
03:15:12.28 --> 03:15:17.48
of your planes for these things I can certainly handle patrol with these things they go okay that's

1697
03:15:17.48 --> 03:15:26.28
okay I guess you can right and and so my wife thought I was nuts so that might seem like nuts and

1698
03:15:26.28 --> 03:15:32.12
then what it seems like even more nuts to me is you entering the political arena yes what

1699
03:15:32.12 --> 03:15:40.92
what brought that about I was asked I was asked by I got a lot of emails texts and

1700
03:15:42.76 --> 03:15:49.40
letters phone calls from people in all 10 counties in New Hampshire all 50 states

1701
03:15:50.12 --> 03:15:57.08
to include across the military asking me to run for office and I thought well if people think I can

1702
03:15:57.08 --> 03:16:06.28
help them I don't have all the answers certainly not a politician and I think there are many

1703
03:16:06.28 --> 03:16:12.84
people in the military would have tested to my my lack of political acumen because it's just not

1704
03:16:12.84 --> 03:16:18.76
there two straight forward blah blah blah but nonetheless if you think I can help you I'm going to try

1705
03:16:18.76 --> 03:16:33.08
and so that's my why for running and and so you know I I just want to help our country our economy

1706
03:16:34.28 --> 03:16:40.28
help us become more physically responsible and help us be able to improve the safety and security

1707
03:16:40.28 --> 03:16:44.60
of Americans so that we can all live the American dream that's all I want to do right

1708
03:16:44.60 --> 03:16:53.08
the oath I took in a military is still valid I still believe in and the American dream and

1709
03:16:53.08 --> 03:16:59.56
the greatness of this country and and I have a tremendous amount of of exposure to

1710
03:17:01.16 --> 03:17:06.52
what other people and other places across the world think and feel about America and the promise

1711
03:17:06.52 --> 03:17:15.80
of America and I think that regardless of your political beliefs or spectrum that you fall on you know

1712
03:17:15.80 --> 03:17:23.56
God family community in country has got to appeal to everybody and that's my platform and that's

1734
03:20:22.76 --> 03:20:28.36
and I'm just going to go there to serve this 1.3 million people in New Hampshire

1735
03:20:28.36 --> 03:20:35.72
and I'm going there to serve every single one of them not just the Republican party but

1736
03:20:35.72 --> 03:20:40.44
you got to serve everybody once you get in that office right you got to declare an office and

1737
03:20:41.000 --> 03:20:47.88
you know my my political beliefs line up as a Republican but that doesn't mean that I don't

1738
03:20:47.88 --> 03:20:51.88
I won't work for in work hard for everybody in New Hampshire regardless of whether they're an

1739
03:20:51.88 --> 03:20:57.16
independent Democrat or libertarian right and I think that's what we've lost in this country

1740
03:20:57.16 --> 03:21:01.96
with the political divisiveness we can't come together on three very important things our

1741
03:21:01.96 --> 03:21:07.24
economy fiscal responsibility and the safety and security of Americans we used to be able to do that

1742
03:21:07.24 --> 03:21:13.16
you know I'm a big fan of JFK you know I mean big fan of him you know and

1743
03:21:14.92 --> 03:21:20.52
he would not even be recognizable today right has matter fact he'd be more of a Republican than

1744
03:21:20.52 --> 03:21:27.48
a Democrat today so we got to come together and we need people that I think have had

1745
03:21:29.24 --> 03:21:36.12
the experiences in life that realizes that we're stronger if we work together then we

1746
03:21:36.84 --> 03:21:39.80
and we are apart and are we going to have our differences yes but

1747
03:21:40.92 --> 03:21:43.24
today our differences are just too much

1748
03:21:43.24 --> 03:21:49.32
too much around what's really important God family community

1749
03:21:51.40 --> 03:21:56.28
also you got social media too right do yeah we're yes sir we're we're on social media

1750
03:21:56.84 --> 03:22:02.12
everything I would be remiss though if I didn't didn't mention the fact that

1751
03:22:03.000 --> 03:22:07.64
everybody that found out I was coming here to talk on your show was like out of their mind

1752
03:22:07.64 --> 03:22:13.40
and it was across the political spectrum that way which is which is really neat and

1753
03:22:14.60 --> 03:22:20.68
no no one more excited than my son Zachary who serves in the New Hampshire National Guide

1754
03:22:20.68 --> 03:22:26.44
he was speechless I mean it was like the goh juggle oh yeah he just couldn't speak right

1755
03:22:26.44 --> 03:22:31.40
and he goes why didn't you tell me and I go I don't know I mean I just you know

1756
03:22:31.40 --> 03:22:37.000
but well we have I work with the with the National Guard extensively my

1757
03:22:37.64 --> 03:22:42.20
deployment to Ramadi they were there when we first showed up and they were just complete

1758
03:22:42.20 --> 03:22:47.64
warriors and professionals and it was an honor to serve with those guys so I

1759
03:22:48.28 --> 03:22:53.08
nothing nothing but love for the National Guard that's for sure yeah he's coming up on his six

1760
03:22:53.08 --> 03:22:59.16
years and he's going to become a veteran he's already made that decision but nonetheless I am proud

1761
03:22:59.16 --> 03:23:05.88
that he served his country and my youngest boy Matt is a senior at Purdue and he just finished his

1762
03:23:07.000 --> 03:23:12.76
his lieutenant training so so that I pulled in the tradition he'll be a second lieutenant on

1763
03:23:12.76 --> 03:23:20.84
active duty look out another ball of scum and fell as so oh so that's probably a good place to

1764
03:23:20.84 --> 03:23:25.16
stop echo you got anything oh yeah real quick going back to the marijuana fields oh

1765
03:23:25.16 --> 03:23:30.04
the scum and deep yeah yeah yeah and you mentioned booby traps yes like what kind of booby

1766
03:23:30.04 --> 03:23:36.44
traps in the the the marijuana growers back in the day would put booby traps around their

1767
03:23:36.44 --> 03:23:40.44
marijuana fields so people who wouldn't sneak in and steal their grow like what kind of

1768
03:23:40.44 --> 03:23:45.88
booby traps so you would get the booby trap where you came across it and it would be just a it

1769
03:23:45.88 --> 03:23:55.48
would it would kick off like like a ditch of like napal fire would come up also like violent booby traps

1770
03:23:55.48 --> 03:24:05.80
bombs the old ones with like you like the you know you know Vietnam era stuff where

1771
03:24:05.80 --> 03:24:10.84
like you stick to sticks and they would they were spring loaded kind of things and they would

1772
03:24:10.84 --> 03:24:16.84
come and they would just hit you in the thigh or the leg or what have you upper body those kind of

1773
03:24:16.84 --> 03:24:23.48
things yeah yeah they were serious yeah yeah well because I'm quiet and this is back in the day

1774
03:24:23.48 --> 03:24:29.48
two when when it was illegal but they'd have booby traps but they wouldn't be violent booby traps they

1775
03:24:29.48 --> 03:24:36.12
just be like alarm tightly you know like I heard one where they had just like cases and cases of

1776
03:24:36.12 --> 03:24:42.36
mouse traps so like if you step on any you nudged it it would have a like you know like a bunch

1777
03:24:42.36 --> 03:24:46.76
of birds taking off whatever but louder it'd be something like that like that kind of stuff

1778
03:24:46.76 --> 03:24:52.60
they had those two violence really early warning device yeah yeah they had that and but they also had

1779
03:24:52.60 --> 03:25:02.36
the closer you got the worse off it was for you and that's why the the the the forest

1780
03:25:02.36 --> 03:25:07.24
Rangers were always you know they were very appreciative of us going in there because we take it

1781
03:25:07.24 --> 03:25:13.08
very slow and you know our guys were trained very trained very well and we had you know we had

1782
03:25:13.08 --> 03:25:20.84
some technology to help us out as well so but yeah that was there it was ugly and we're lucky

1783
03:25:20.84 --> 03:25:28.04
that we didn't set any of them off that were able to either go around them or you know neutralize

1784
03:25:28.04 --> 03:25:36.84
them in a different way was you know old fashioned way was with the the rope and the

1785
03:25:36.84 --> 03:25:44.28
grappling grappling that pull about watch what happens wow that was a good show

1786
03:25:45.64 --> 03:25:50.52
glad we went around that right on yeah general any closing thoughts

1787
03:25:51.80 --> 03:25:57.16
well I think the only closing thought that I would have and since this is you know you focus on

1788
03:25:57.16 --> 03:26:06.84
leadership a lot is I just like to let everybody know that throughout all this I realized that

1789
03:26:06.84 --> 03:26:13.72
I was imperfect leader and that as long as I remembered really three things and that is to

1790
03:26:13.72 --> 03:26:21.08
remain humble thankful and grateful and that I never let my ego get in the way and I was always

1791
03:26:21.08 --> 03:26:28.84
self aware of my weaknesses and worked on those and let my strengths be what they are you

1792
03:26:29.32 --> 03:26:35.80
better off for me and everybody else around me and these type of shows and the things that you do

1793
03:26:35.80 --> 03:26:44.92
and what this show does for anyone who listens to it is is hugely important for America because

1794
03:26:44.92 --> 03:26:54.52
right now but we need more anything else is effective leadership it is it is a huge huge

1795
03:26:55.16 --> 03:27:03.000
issue and and something that I think my experience is teaching in college and being around my own

1796
03:27:03.000 --> 03:27:10.76
kids and being around others is they're thriving for you know leadership and these examples that we

1797
03:27:10.76 --> 03:27:16.04
have seen in the past and and you represent that here with this show and I just want to thank you

1798
03:27:16.04 --> 03:27:22.92
for this opportunity I'm humbled and grateful for it and so thank you for what you do and thanks for

1799
03:27:22.92 --> 03:27:29.32
letting me tell my story well thanks for coming on thanks for joining us more important thank you for

1800
03:27:29.32 --> 03:27:35.88
your leadership your service to our great nation your sacrifices overseas it's been a long

1801
03:27:35.88 --> 03:27:42.68
war for America you were there for most of it and that's saying a lot and you are still continuing

1802
03:27:42.68 --> 03:27:51.08
to fight for America we appreciate it thank you God bless you thank you very much and with that

1803
03:27:52.04 --> 03:28:01.96
general done bulldog has left the building definitely seen a lot

1804
03:28:01.96 --> 03:28:08.60
and always looking to improve I think that's something we can definitely take away

1805
03:28:10.36 --> 03:28:15.48
maybe we can all look to improve maybe that's a good idea echo Charles yes sir

1806
03:28:17.96 --> 03:28:25.48
any suggestions and where we can start to improve ourselves yes what you got well he did mention

1807
03:28:25.48 --> 03:28:33.24
how he's he didn't say he was the oldest one cadet in the police I think it's safe to assume

1808
03:28:33.24 --> 03:28:39.88
he's the one that to be a 99 yeah but he did imply that you know but the fact the point is he's

1809
03:28:39.88 --> 03:28:45.08
out there staying capable talking about jumping out of planes with hips a certain way to the

1810
03:28:45.08 --> 03:28:49.40
extent where they're like oh yeah you pass just you can do you can still do this kind of stuff you

1811
03:28:49.40 --> 03:28:56.68
were this capable you're in meaning the hips past yeah exactly right they're good to go remember

1812
03:28:56.68 --> 03:29:00.92
they're they're like oh you you know they're concerned about his hips whatever and he was okay

1813
03:29:00.92 --> 03:29:05.08
I jump out of planes with these hips and they're like oh and then you can patrol all right

1814
03:29:06.04 --> 03:29:14.84
point is very capable high levels of capability 59 29 19 years old whatever we're maintaining it

1815
03:29:14.84 --> 03:29:21.80
that clock is ticking clock is ticking I heard that too yeah that one so only want to keep

1816
03:29:21.80 --> 03:29:30.04
ourselves capable mentally physically of course through this path of capability chasing

1817
03:29:30.04 --> 03:29:34.52
we're chasing capability of course through this path we're going to take some beatings 100% take

1818
03:29:34.52 --> 03:29:42.12
of our meat yeah you do some duty to take beating sometimes sometimes sometimes yes and that

1819
03:29:42.12 --> 03:29:46.76
gun against squeezed on that one so you know unlike I said hey I after I rolled with you that

1820
03:29:46.76 --> 03:29:51.64
one day and I was like man I feel like I got hit by a truck and you're like oh yeah full body

1821
03:29:51.64 --> 03:29:58.92
domes right yeah it's way more than full body domes so magical got some emotional

1822
03:29:58.92 --> 03:30:04.84
domes as well yeah man and that's that's real you know these it that's just one of the

1823
03:30:04.84 --> 03:30:07.40
many examples of the beatings you're going to take on this path no problem though

1824
03:30:07.40 --> 03:30:12.84
sometimes you need some supplementation to help you through those beatings in fact you get through

1825
03:30:12.84 --> 03:30:18.52
these beatings that's when the capability starts to emerge seem saying additional levels of

1826
03:30:18.52 --> 03:30:24.84
capability anyway got some supplements for you can help you help us so first supplement I

1827
03:30:24.84 --> 03:30:32.28
would talk about is a new era of energy drinks straight up like the the old new category new

1828
03:30:32.28 --> 03:30:42.76
category new paradigm shift oh yeah two three yomiya discipline go yeah yeah yeah yeah so no sugar

1829
03:30:42.76 --> 03:30:48.12
it's a healthy energy drink straight up that actually tastes good yeah it's also someone someone

1830
03:30:48.12 --> 03:30:53.32
wrote hey I thought Jockel didn't drink energy drinks I heard him say he didn't drink them unless he

1831
03:30:53.32 --> 03:30:59.48
really needed him well why is that that's true that's a fact is a fact before this came out

1832
03:30:59.48 --> 03:31:05.08
because you weren't going to want to drink one of the other energy you were going to you don't

1833
03:31:05.08 --> 03:31:11.96
want to drink those unless you had to yeah I've got a 19 hour drive I'm 14 hours into it I'm fading

1834
03:31:11.96 --> 03:31:16.76
I need something to boost me up for the next three hours okay cool overdose with caffeine

1835
03:31:16.76 --> 03:31:22.76
get your jitters on but you get there yeah so that's what I used to do for sure now the

1836
03:31:22.76 --> 03:31:29.96
substance I oh I've got something that I can drink it's actually healthy for me and it gives me the benefits

1837
03:31:29.96 --> 03:31:40.76
of energy right it's a no-brainer yeah so do do do I drink traditional old school poisonous

1838
03:31:41.88 --> 03:31:48.04
energy drinks the answer is no I don't I used to occasionally if I needed to now don't

1839
03:31:48.04 --> 03:31:53.88
do never need to do that again because we have an alternative that's functional and works

1840
03:31:54.52 --> 03:31:58.76
so there you go and taste good did you drink kombucha no have you ever

1841
03:31:58.76 --> 03:32:04.76
I've tasted it I've probably it might have almost touched my lips but I can just smell stuff

1842
03:32:04.76 --> 03:32:10.20
and I don't like it right yeah oh come kombucha is no exception in that regard but it tastes junk

1843
03:32:10.20 --> 03:32:15.88
taste bad I know people including people that I'm related to that are so down with kombucha

1844
03:32:15.88 --> 03:32:21.56
I get I get more females like kombucha than males I don't have those numbers in my family that's

1845
03:32:21.56 --> 03:32:26.76
what I'm going on my family females are drinking kombucha yeah kombucha what is it yeah

1846
03:32:26.76 --> 03:32:31.40
kombucha kombucha they're drinking females males not drinking my father in last

1847
03:32:31.40 --> 03:32:36.28
straight up makes it straight up it's like a process it's a thing and then I assume he drinks it

1848
03:32:36.28 --> 03:32:43.40
yes sir he does but in my experience you are more females are into kombucha you can males but

1849
03:32:43.40 --> 03:32:48.20
that's not the point the point is if you ever tasted it you're like cool kombucha so healthy you

1850
03:32:48.20 --> 03:32:54.84
know it's detox and whatever they say about kombucha I don't know it's healthy we'll just say bro

1851
03:32:54.84 --> 03:32:58.68
try taste it you're like all right you all endure that taste for the health benefits you seem

1852
03:32:58.68 --> 03:33:03.64
same but there's no reason to do that no there's not that's the thing so this one especially

1853
03:33:03.64 --> 03:33:09.56
the mango flavor you drink down and you're like wait a second taste good and healthy and gives me

1854
03:33:09.56 --> 03:33:16.52
energy no no lose situation right there okay just so everybody knows that the the mango

1855
03:33:16.52 --> 03:33:21.96
flavor there's no difference other than the flavor yes you can't put it over here on a pedestal

1856
03:33:21.96 --> 03:33:28.60
of whatever it tastes the best so in your opinion yes yeah I think any of the consensus

1857
03:33:28.60 --> 03:33:35.24
still getting being formulated because new which is another kind of novel thing new flavor so you

1858
03:33:35.24 --> 03:33:40.20
know you want to look at that one I always go back to old faithful jockel ponder yeah I can't I

1859
03:33:40.20 --> 03:33:45.48
can't argue with that right yeah it's legitimate yes sir JP to no point it out that jockel ponder

1860
03:33:45.48 --> 03:33:50.52
tastes good whether it's like room temperature or whether it's cold yeah don't want to hear good

1861
03:33:50.52 --> 03:33:56.36
you go orange is like that too so yeah get your oh it's called jockel discipline go if you didn't

1862
03:33:56.36 --> 03:34:01.72
know already which you know most of us do know but we I do want to kind of reiterate these things about it

1863
03:34:01.72 --> 03:34:07.16
yeah by the way it's available in wall wall right now and we're working on a bunch of other

1864
03:34:07.16 --> 03:34:12.36
convenience stores you'll be seeing it but everyone that's been going out to wall wall and just

1865
03:34:12.36 --> 03:34:17.32
clear and shelves thank you because that makes the other you're actually helping everyone in the

1866
03:34:17.32 --> 03:34:22.84
in the nation you're helping everything is because other convenience stores look at wall on

1867
03:34:22.84 --> 03:34:27.000
thing oh how's it going they go how's it doing they're whoa yeah you're selling a lot of that

1868
03:34:27.000 --> 03:34:31.64
stuff so that means other convenience stores go all right we want it too and they're saying that

1869
03:34:31.64 --> 03:34:39.56
so we appreciate East Coast troopers out there clearing shelves in wall wall yeah it does make sense right

1870
03:34:39.56 --> 03:34:44.28
if you're a let's say convenience store owner yeah right okay it makes the decisions whatever

1871
03:34:44.28 --> 03:34:48.36
and he's gonna be like wait the healthy energy drink he's gonna be thinking kombucha or something like this

1872
03:34:48.36 --> 03:34:53.64
where it's like cool to know might not taste that good whatever but wall was over here demonstrating

1873
03:34:53.64 --> 03:34:57.48
the aim rather it's gonna taste good too you know so they're like oh I get it now you know they kind

1874
03:34:57.48 --> 03:35:03.56
of connect in the dots a little bit yeah so there's all this data so they go back and it's been great

1875
03:35:03.56 --> 03:35:09.16
so again since you're appreciation everyone that's been rolling out to wall wall and just getting it

1876
03:35:09.80 --> 03:35:15.16

1877
03:35:15.16 --> 03:35:20.84
stores are getting on board and then other people will have access to this wonderful

1878
03:35:20.84 --> 03:35:29.32
nutritious as Travis Mills said nutritious and delicious delicious and delicious oh yeah fully also other

1879
03:35:29.32 --> 03:35:34.84
items that can that do help us on the path is we've got some joint stuff joint warfare super

1880
03:35:34.84 --> 03:35:42.36
krill oil another good for your joints oh yeah and the thing is it's a big deal and this is like we

1881
03:35:42.36 --> 03:35:50.20
always say this is one of those things where this really pays for itself in a way that's like invisible

1882
03:35:50.20 --> 03:35:54.04
because you're not worried about your joints you all feel the difference when you don't have it

1883
03:35:54.04 --> 03:36:00.76
what's interesting here's what's interesting we have massive amount of subscriptions to those too

1884
03:36:02.12 --> 03:36:08.92
so people yes send it to me every month because they want to not miss out on that goodness

1885
03:36:08.92 --> 03:36:12.92
yeah and then so I just worry they don't want to know about that and if you want to subscribe to it

1886
03:36:13.48 --> 03:36:18.76
you get free shipping by the way which is cool we don't have to pay for shipping

1887
03:36:18.76 --> 03:36:22.52
you can also not pay for shipping if you go to a vitamin shop you can get all the stuff

1888
03:36:22.52 --> 03:36:27.56
a vitamin shop they've also been supportive and everyone has been supportive rolling and

1889
03:36:27.56 --> 03:36:32.28
a vitamin shop buy and stuff so very cool we appreciate it we'll keep making milk we'll keep

1890
03:36:32.28 --> 03:36:37.08
making things that taste good and are good for you that's what we're doing jockelfield.com

1891
03:36:37.08 --> 03:36:47.40
you also or gen USA dot com this is where you can get American made denim shoe or boots

1892
03:36:47.40 --> 03:36:52.92
some other all the cool new stuff that people think so working pants got some jutsu stuff on there

1893
03:36:52.92 --> 03:36:57.16
as well so if you're joining jutsu you don't have a gui yet or maybe if you do have a gui

1894
03:36:58.12 --> 03:37:04.36
origin and how are we coming out with some new keys yeah yeah I said that in kind of a but let's face it

1895
03:37:05.16 --> 03:37:11.48
the guis at origin I got put up I have the first like one of the first rift guis I have I was

1896
03:37:11.48 --> 03:37:17.08
worn it yesterday where were you yesterday? I was at you know somewhere okay while I was training

1897
03:37:17.08 --> 03:37:25.08
on the massive justice I was wearing the first edition white rift guis things are freaking unbelievable

1898
03:37:25.08 --> 03:37:34.76
it's like a whole new thing era yeah a paradigm shift yeah yeah yeah yeah they're the best

1899
03:37:34.76 --> 03:37:39.72
the the only downside is that you will potentially be spoiled in that way throw away your

1900
03:37:39.72 --> 03:37:45.56
other guis or at least marginalism I had I put on one to see oh yeah does it still fit and you

1901
03:37:45.56 --> 03:37:49.48
know feel like it and you feel like I would never wear this I mean cool respect oh you put

1902
03:37:49.48 --> 03:37:55.72
one of the old ones and it's it just simply went out of the rotation yeah and plus you know it

1903
03:37:55.72 --> 03:38:03.88
has bad karma why because it was made by a slave labor yeah china yeah yeah what's cool

1904
03:38:03.88 --> 03:38:09.16
too is and we can you can see this on the origin youtube channel it's like it's the opposite of slave

1905
03:38:09.16 --> 03:38:13.32
labor it's like it's one thing to be like okay you have slave labor okay they don't want to be

1906
03:38:13.32 --> 03:38:17.24
there they're kind of in a way like obligated or forced in one some way to be there and they

1907
03:38:17.24 --> 03:38:21.08
got to make this stuff okay that's terrible obviously but then you have like maybe the quote

1908
03:38:21.08 --> 03:38:24.92
unquote stand towards like hey that's the job they're gonna go and they're gonna do it but you

1909
03:38:24.92 --> 03:38:29.08
get origin you go there brought those there but every single one you see them all man they go

1910
03:38:29.08 --> 03:38:33.24
for the car they care about that stitch you see what they care about like the whole deal then they

1911
03:38:33.24 --> 03:38:39.72
make that even you get to wear it that's the then you get positive karma this karma with that

1912
03:38:39.72 --> 03:38:47.24
you all around good karma with those jeans the working pants supporting American economy as well

1913
03:38:47.88 --> 03:38:52.84

1931
03:40:28.76 --> 03:40:34.60
that we can remain free out here and because of these people doing all kind of weird stuff

1932
03:40:34.60 --> 03:40:39.80
with these platforms that we're on so far everything's been cool it's cool we appreciate it

1933
03:40:39.80 --> 03:40:46.04
but contingency wise you can't just you can't build your house on someone else's

1934
03:40:46.04 --> 03:40:51.32
bland because they might come around and kick you off right so we may have an early land

1935

it's called jocco underground dot com if you want to help us support that land if you want to

1936

03:41:10.92 --> 03:41:15.72
we want you there as long as you're in the game you can just email assistance at jocco underground dot com

1940
03:41:15.72 --> 03:41:20.60
that's we appreciate it again for real if something goes sideways on these platforms we're going to be

1941
03:41:20.60 --> 03:41:27.16
there and and as a as a appreciation we do another little podcast it's usually about an hour

1942
03:41:27.96 --> 03:41:33.72
we talk about some other subjects we answer Q&A questions that have been sent directly to the underground

1943
03:41:34.60 --> 03:41:39.48
then we cannot tell you what's up so that's that we also be YouTube channel and a lot of people

1944
03:41:39.48 --> 03:41:48.92
correctly identified on the latest release of the mayhem movie that echo Charles made a lot of people

1945
03:41:48.92 --> 03:41:56.68
recognize that there was some powerful assistant directing on all of the common strong ADP

1946
03:41:56.68 --> 03:42:01.96
as new the ADP presence I'm the assistant director and and also you know kind of

1947
03:42:02.84 --> 03:42:07.24
I had a supporting role in that yeah what do you think so actually you might have been the lead

1948
03:42:07.24 --> 03:42:12.84
unknown I don't know if I had zero lines yeah which is they were powerful though that's the thing

1949
03:42:12.84 --> 03:42:17.56
you're zero lines because your whole performance is powerful because big shocker echo made a movie and

1950
03:42:17.56 --> 03:42:20.76
he's the star of it that's kind of the feeling that most people got

1951
03:42:23.56 --> 03:42:29.64
retired main tie this sent me like it was a clip of us talking about it or whatever and

1952
03:42:31.24 --> 03:42:35.48
how like you know the the time you're you're clicking on the can or whatever in the video or whatever

1953
03:42:35.48 --> 03:42:40.68
it gets me I guess at the end of the day I was giving you props for that oh whatever and

1954
03:42:41.64 --> 03:42:47.40
I feel like everyone including main tie is kind of just sort of recognizing you straight up

1955
03:42:47.96 --> 03:42:54.20
you're the AD assistant director so all right let's find out what I still feel like I'm in the shadow of the star

1956
03:42:54.84 --> 03:43:02.60
the person with all the lines yes and the most camera time yes you are no that's you dude

1957
03:43:02.60 --> 03:43:10.44
you're in you yes are you to channel we do have a on top of jockelv in this assistant director we do

1958
03:43:10.44 --> 03:43:16.04
other video version of all this stuff if you want to see what general don bull buck looks like you

1959
03:43:16.04 --> 03:43:20.68
come on here yeah and you took a youtube channel youtube is you know one of those things now it's not

1960
03:43:20.68 --> 03:43:26.44
just a video thing anymore it's like some people it's their preferred method to like watch TV

1961
03:43:26.44 --> 03:43:30.52
listen to podcasts or whatever so I dig it and we got you that's what we got this whole thing

1962
03:43:30.52 --> 03:43:38.12
I think I'm a little stable yeah I mean does anyone worth TV like actual TV like a show

1963
03:43:38.12 --> 03:43:45.40
yeah is that happening yeah okay some DVR action okay I don't know if people still watch it live like live

1964
03:43:45.40 --> 03:43:51.40
I don't think so that might be very low numbers and the all-sector the commercials and stuff

1965
03:43:51.40 --> 03:43:58.12
the commercials are kind of a non-starter for me if it's junction in life yeah you know it's weird

1966
03:43:58.12 --> 03:44:05.000
to my kids kind of the same way is like I like commercial not all of them but well fast forward

1967
03:44:05.000 --> 03:44:08.68
through them but if I see one then I'm like oh let me see that commercial like it's kind of

1968
03:44:08.68 --> 03:44:12.44
there's no commercial there's like a because some commercials there's this little story

1969
03:44:12.44 --> 03:44:18.76
living in the commercial it's kind of good I feel that way right so yeah anyway yeah the point is

1970
03:44:18.76 --> 03:44:24.04
we have a youtube channel bull subscribe to it subscribe to it if you want it's good one

1971
03:44:24.04 --> 03:44:29.96
so yeah there you go also psychological warfare if you don't know what that is an album

1972
03:44:30.60 --> 03:44:37.08
a jockel album with jockel tracks on there telling us how to get past our moments of weakness when we

1973
03:44:37.08 --> 03:44:41.000
have them and I have them from time to time but you know gotta worry about that kind of stuff

1974
03:44:41.000 --> 03:44:47.32
because jockel tell you why you should get over 100% uh success on the 100% if you want to hang

1975
03:44:47.32 --> 03:44:53.56
something cool on your wall why not make it something from flipsidecampus.com that my brother

1976
03:44:53.56 --> 03:45:01.16
Dakota Meyer made owns he is the owner make fun how do we make fun of him he's the creative

1977
03:45:01.16 --> 03:45:07.000
artistic director of that thing there you go Dakota creative artistic director I think that's

1978
03:45:07.000 --> 03:45:13.000
the title he's always wanted yeah I don't doubt it it's a good title that's Dakota one of my heroes

1979
03:45:13.000 --> 03:45:17.24
and if you want to get some stuff to hang on your wall flipsidecampus.com got a bunch of books

1980
03:45:18.36 --> 03:45:22.04
I've written a bunch of books but the one that's coming out next is called final spin

1981
03:45:22.04 --> 03:45:27.64
we don't know if it's a novel we don't know if it's a poem we don't know if it's a manuscript we

1982
03:45:27.64 --> 03:45:31.80
don't know what it is but it tells a story story with some lessons

1983
03:45:36.04 --> 03:45:43.24
I let my oldest daughter read the book final spin and she got done reading it

1984
03:45:44.04 --> 03:45:49.24
and she came out the kitchen and like I could see that she just got done reading it

1985
03:45:49.24 --> 03:45:55.32
and I go oh you know what do you think and she started explaining to me what she liked and what she

1986
03:45:55.32 --> 03:46:03.88
didn't like and she started crying well she was explaining it that's when I said to myself okay

1987
03:46:03.88 --> 03:46:09.72
looks like I found it it's like we got it we got what we wanted yeah that's funny that we just have

1988
03:46:09.72 --> 03:46:14.52
some kind of an impact right that's what we want yeah want that thing to leave a mark a little bit

1989
03:46:14.52 --> 03:46:19.88
you ever think about that like why do we you're cried during the movie no come on bro

1990
03:46:19.88 --> 03:46:25.16
zero you never cried during the movie no we're not you didn't say when I was young ever yeah

a test of time hey I went to the theater when I was a kid it was all that movie and I was with

1995
03:46:49.72 --> 03:46:55.000
a friend of mine and we were kind of you know little tough guys we were probably 10 something like

1996
03:46:55.000 --> 03:47:02.60
that little tough guys you know and we were bawling and I watched the movie well apart that

1997
03:47:02.60 --> 03:47:07.24
I can't remember the end of it or something I don't know he goes home I mean event right that's

1998
03:47:07.24 --> 03:47:12.12
like what it's supposed to be the so I watch it with my daughter and I'm sort of bracing for her

1999
03:47:12.12 --> 03:47:18.28
and I'm thinking all this going she she just it was bad it didn't stand the test of time

2000
03:47:18.28 --> 03:47:24.28
now look jaws as you know I mean jaws one of my favorite movies Steven Spielberg good job credit

2001
03:47:24.28 --> 03:47:29.40
that's the test of time and then some now could we go back maybe CGI some shark activity

2002
03:47:29.40 --> 03:47:34.68
we probably good I guess I don't really want them to do you want them to no no you like it old school

2003
03:47:34.68 --> 03:47:40.44
so keep it the way it is bro but you're not gonna beat Quinn and chief brody right it's not happening

2004
03:47:40.44 --> 03:47:46.52
I mean who's gonna do better Quinn let's face it so Steven Spielberg jaws to the test of time

2005
03:47:46.52 --> 03:47:54.52
good to go credit however ET bro wait why it cuz the story or just cuz the special thing the whole thing

2006
03:47:54.52 --> 03:48:01.80
the whole thing it was like an okay movie but I don't like okay movies you know that doesn't do it

2007
03:48:01.80 --> 03:48:06.04
for me they gotta blow you away yeah I want to get I want to get something to take an hour and a half

2008
03:48:06.04 --> 03:48:11.56
to watch movie maybe two hours sometimes I'm not and this juncture my life if something's not

2009
03:48:11.56 --> 03:48:18.68
good to go I'm done no time we're not watching it yeah I will leave a theater I will leave

2010
03:48:18.68 --> 03:48:23.56
I'm not watching this stupid or you know what I'll actually do sleep thanks to you like

2011
03:48:23.56 --> 03:48:28.84
get some rest oh yeah if I'm with my wife or my kids and there's a bad movie we want to

2012
03:48:28.84 --> 03:48:36.68
saw okay have you ever heard of a horror movie that's called it yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah so the

2013
03:48:36.68 --> 03:48:41.96
first one came out my kids really like that horror movie my wife doesn't even watch one millisecond

2014
03:48:41.96 --> 03:48:46.76
of a horror movie the first the first the first the new ones cuz it is old school that's old

2015
03:48:46.76 --> 03:48:51.96
first the new ones he's doing with the clown face and that's all that's all that's all he's the

2016
03:48:51.96 --> 03:48:57.08
story okay so I watched the the one of them okay anyways okay but then my kids were all

2017
03:48:57.08 --> 03:49:02.36
amped and so we actually went to the theater to go see it the second version of whatever the

2018
03:49:02.36 --> 03:49:10.52
tune to the two those those whatever we were all in there it is so bad I just was like I

2019
03:49:10.52 --> 03:49:18.52
watched maybe seven to twelve minutes of it maybe maybe and I was out sleep cut up on some sleep

2020
03:49:18.52 --> 03:49:24.76
they woke me up I saw the last the last seven minutes of it yeah it was so bad

2021
03:49:24.76 --> 03:49:30.60
and we all walked out of there my kids thought it was bad too oh for a thing okay let me

2022
03:49:30.60 --> 03:49:35.24
make sense you ever okay it's okay now we're kind of deviating but I don't care talk about it

2023
03:49:35.24 --> 03:49:40.36
it's cool I've never seen the nuance I saw the old ones like they're super long too and cool I

2024
03:49:40.36 --> 03:49:46.44
get what they're doing and they're good but it the new not chapter two like the the first one

2025
03:49:46.44 --> 03:49:51.88
of the new ones so the thing I didn't see any of the butt they they have a trailer for that

2026
03:49:51.88 --> 03:49:57.000
no man it's really good trailer they have a few of them but it's the one where it's like hey

2027
03:49:58.68 --> 03:50:05.08
there's Georgie and the older brother I forget the older brother he's like hey you'll float

2028
03:50:05.08 --> 03:50:10.20
to like hey if you come down here or everything floats down here is what the ghost kid says right

2029
03:50:10.20 --> 03:50:14.04
everything floats down there I think that's what the clown said first I guess anyway so he's like

2030
03:50:14.04 --> 03:50:19.72
if you come down here you'll float too and then like this beat this horror kind of beat like

2031
03:50:19.72 --> 03:50:24.68
starts speaking out but he goes yo float too you know float it's really really well done

2032
03:50:24.68 --> 03:50:29.80
trailer now one yep well must have been better than the movie I think so and remember when

2033
03:50:29.80 --> 03:50:33.80
a long time ago when we were talking you were like oh why did you start video or whatever

2034
03:50:33.80 --> 03:50:38.76
and the whole phenomenon that some some movies actually a lot of movies I mean I could name a lot

2035
03:50:38.76 --> 03:50:43.80
of movies that the trailer is better than the movie like watching the trailer provides a better like

2036
03:50:43.80 --> 03:50:48.60
experience than watching the movie yeah that's totally true so that phenomenon is kind of what made

2037
03:50:48.60 --> 03:50:53.96
me like one of the videos or whatever you know it that's wonderful you have to say the tea

2038
