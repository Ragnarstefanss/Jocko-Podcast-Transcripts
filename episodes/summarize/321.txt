And then so like I'm trying to imagine, you know, like every time everyone talks like when they tell their story, I always try to kind of put myself like, I want to know how they were, you know, like what they looked like. And I, and I, and I talked to him before I left us, like, you know, what do you think it, you know, can I just go to another gym and, and, and he said yes, but what I found, especially with COVID, it's tough to kind of show up for just a couple of weeks and, you know, nobody knows where you've been and, you know, I think the light gyms is just like this, because it's such close contact, that, you know, they kind of stay in their own. my mom worked Later on she got remarried they owned a body shop so they ran that and then my father was in Not too far away in Louisville and he ran his own business did kind of answering service for people who I did Inspection's house inspection so they would call him he would set up the appointments and and then just Facts the appointments to them But who was more influential to me was probably my my best friends family and he was Mr. Hollywood great guy Still is today, but he was retired or not retired but he was in Vietnam In the army and just you know kind of an outdoors type person and was Real instrumental in helping you know me kind of Get into that outdoor you know not staying inside getting out and and being in nature more a big hunter Had a lot of Guns and stuff which made me more comfortable around it and all this stuff made a big difference later on because you have being from Kentucky going to San Diego was it was a big change And whether you know they they're like I'm not ready to class up so you know maybe they wouldn't do as many of the Pro's just because you had orders there It costs way too much to send you someplace else so if you kind of You know you could you could stay in fourth phase for months You know maybe even a year but too too long but your clock doesn't start until you class up because Yeah a lot of people think and I I did You know before I found out that you know, but it's kind of like boot camp where you're there I'm all the time, but it's not you know you you have a schedule You show up for the schedule when you're done for the day you're done and we can't you're done so we lived out in town And where'd you guys live down in I be? We we set up the great antennas because we had all this time to set them up because we weren't sleeping And we make all of our com windows we make good communications on all those com windows and we end up as the number one Parent and the number one pair gets the early extract meaning when everyone had to stay in like The full day or the extra night or whatever We get pulled out of the field early as the number one pair two freaking meatball new guys We get pulled out of the field early and Here's a here's an awesome thing and I don't know if I don't know if you know this but that chief Called And we're all kind of going into the departments I was like I want to go into the comms department and because nobody else wanted it because carrying the radio was heavy and People had this kind of idea that comms was Just a mysterious magic thing when when it worked It was pfm you know pure fucking magic when it didn't well, you know God's weren't aligned, you know that Yeah, I, you know, I attribute that to, uh, really to you, Jaco, it, you know, listen as podcasts when my favorite things when you have guys from, you know, World War II, Korea, the, you know, the Vietnam and just the stories that they telling everybody's got a story. I go I go what I got to understand what he was doing like I'm falling by the way It was this mean like are you're freaking up a different position on the boat you're gonna you're gonna paddle from over here I didn't know what the fucking talking about and so I think I literally said like what are you talking about? But I mean we we We understood it we we had The skill down and there was nobody could touch us and you probably remember the guy who taught comms and training self at the time He was not a family Me you hated you hated me you were quiet enough to be like going to the radar I was like that's actually wrong 19 year old jockel is a handful When you're as cute and he was doing his conglies He was just all over the place and I remember specifically the Zulu time to remember that What he was trying to explain in developing a comms plan that all times are in Zulu and why it's in Zulu But his terminology wasn't quite correct and He was saying that Zulu time is so many hours Back or something and you were like no Zulu time is Or, you know, you're, you're new, you know, the new song or whatever, you got to get that, that fan, you know, down the, the funnel to, to get them from interested to fan to real fanatic of, you know, the super fan, or they're going to buy your stuff as soon as it comes out. Yeah, it might be what you remember it might have been a I don't know if it's a DOR or if it's a performance I don't need there, but again, but that it was kind of another realization of You know, you don't know who's gonna make it through do you remember how many people we classed up with so the number that I Remember and I don't have any real evidence to this it was about 116 or some somewhere a little for 100 really and I'm like 71 fail You got such an asshole I feel bad dude, you know, but at the time you and also at that time it was like you didn't know who is making it you didn't and then you get to the top you flip through the side and you drop down I do not remember that this is one of the few things I remember for the thoughts is this evolution right here And watching that guy his forms gave out his forms got it because he couldn't he couldn't pull himself up the rope and You know Guys were kind of passing him through and he spent he spent the whole evolution on that wall and We're you know the students that were done were over there Charney mom the instructors were chairman and they were like get over the wall get over the wall And, you know, there's, there's no way to force, you know, reason to force it on them, you know, I kind of explained to him, you know, this is what we're looking for. And that's like a theme throughout all the, you know, that in fact, like later on, that's like why he like ruined the story. Because, you know, they were going out for, you know, public things and, you know, when there's a threat, they want to know about it. and I just remember He kind of commanded Everything even though he wasn't the guy in charge, but he spoke the language and you know kind of going back to You know you want you want to be an asset and To be a calm guy you're always gonna go because you have the radio what if you're a linguist that that too and this was the 90s so at the time The administrators I think it was built-in administration And, at that time, you know, I didn't know what it has for, you know, you know, tell me about the war. You know, like, hey, when somebody tells you something, and well, you know, he's like, okay, yeah, absolutely. Just like even like the guns thing, like you know, how does those kind of certification just have more capability overall? Or we like what took us that way like let's separate them so we separate them and we're like freaking Who's sure we're like freaking too Sherlock Holmes up in this piece right here? And we weren't really driving, like, you know, like, we were later, you know, definitely what you guys were doing later. It was, I was something in turn, I never really asked, you know, my, when I showed up to the platoon, my thing was, uh, you know, I'm just here to, to do what I can to make the platoon better, you know, where we're going to Afghanistan. So we go to like this, uh, barrier position, you know, we're kind of on the edge as a, uh, as a, you know, blocking position. I mean sometimes sometimes you get that you just get the the bad draw and especially on pool comp You know if you got it somebody who's kind of watching force You know, it's like did you do 71 I'll teach you and he did he took me out and taught me how to dive Under the water and like hell and just get through and That was kind of my first experience of this is this is what a team does you know when somebody has an issue a buddy who has a little bit of knowledge says hey, you know I can help you out It was like, okay, so the last time I jumped with the last time I went and I hadn't jumped for like a long time, probably like eight years, maybe. And, of course, I ran a lot outside of, uh, just track, but, uh, but, yeah, like today, uh, another thing I try to do as we, as we travel, I, I look for great runs, you know, running, running places. And finally they started making some modern boots that will now were Comparable to the boots so now we go to SQT Which was awesome we had great instructors in there great instructors teach us the fundamentals we were kind we we got It was almost like our generation of instructors those guys were like a one degree of separation from Vietnam For the vast majority of our instructor it was I also think it was important that The training was still at the team at the time there's less of that subjectivity When we went through it was it was very subjective and in many cases that was the right thing Because a team guy and structures looking at a guy saying I don't really want this guy and I'll tune with me Which is the ultimate test Now there's a great trick that one of the master chiefs played on the instructors at one point one of the master chiefs who you know, but He he was running buds and he brought all the instructors into a room and was said, you know, And, and I remember he told me, you know, if you live on base, I will come out there and punch you because he's like, you need to get out and town, live amongst the, uh, the populace, the populace and experience living overseas like you should. hey I do things you know we should we should make this You know make sure it's hard as it can be and set the standards and everyone's like yeah I mean, we were doing like long patrols, like week long, you know, eight days, nine days with resupplys, that kind of stuff. I didn't know him at the time and you know I think you had to do 75 sit ups or something like this and And it was a straw it was kind of hard to get the I don't know if you remember this the hardest thing about getting it Actually approved was the amount of batteries it was gonna take the 5590 batteries that cost $64 each or something like this and we're gonna have to out fit 20 guys or whatever it was and our initial answer was no No, you you can't have money for those batteries use the rechargeable batteries which were the B-A what were they called B-A 55 something else like oh, I'm not gonna quit that that does happen guys just not gonna quit They're just tough, but they don't belong in the teams and they could they would get rid of that guy But occasion you get a guy like that officer who was a good guy, but I mean we did we and but when I graduated and got commissioned as an incident They could have sent me to you know To swoke school like it is you know you could be a pilot you could be whatever And I had that too, like, even, even literally when I got to Baghdad, my first platoon, I was like, the, the, the, the, the SAA, who's a freaking, like, awesome guy. I wasn't so I had when I accepted It was and it was part of the interview process like well, what if you don't come back to the teams because at the time You know again this is the 90s late 90s You know they they didn't have that that that You Opening And, you know, I like to think that we, you know, move the needle, hopefully a little bit. But, there was a lot of, you know, if we do really well, then, you know, we'll get move over to here, some I will get fired, and, you know, we'll, we'll be able to take that mission. You know low mode they were like hey, I'll keep about I'm gonna do what I'm just gonna make cause it was a scary place In the 90s at team one as a new guy it was there was much different there was there was There was scenarios I could unfold really quickly if you were out of line as a new guy and Your platoon had definitely had some bruzers in it. But in such different ways, like if you talk to, you know, you say like, maybe seals don't have a stereotype where they, you think they have a stereotype. Like, what is marketing and what is, you know, social media was a big, you know, was starting to be a big thing. You know, I had a lot to learn of, you know, you're not, you know, the E6, any more.
