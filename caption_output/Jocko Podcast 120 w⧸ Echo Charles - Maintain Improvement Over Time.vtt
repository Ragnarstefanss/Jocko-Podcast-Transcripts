00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.20
This is Jockel Podcast number 120.

2
00:00:04.20 --> 00:00:07.40
With echo Charles and me, Jockel Willick.

3
00:00:07.40 --> 00:00:08.40
Good evening, I go.

4
00:00:08.40 --> 00:00:09.90
Good evening.

5
00:00:09.90 --> 00:00:12.20
So it's been a while since Q&A.

6
00:00:12.20 --> 00:00:13.20
Yeah.

7
00:00:13.20 --> 00:00:16.20
So we have some Q&A from the interwebs.

8
00:00:16.20 --> 00:00:17.000
Yeah.

9
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Go.

10
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.20
First question.

11
00:00:20.20 --> 00:00:23.20
Jockel.

12
00:00:23.20 --> 00:00:28.40
More than once on the podcast, you've mentioned how the teams were so competitive

13
00:00:28.40 --> 00:00:34.32
that no one wanted to admit when they were cold, being too cold puts you at a tactical disadvantage.

14
00:00:34.32 --> 00:00:37.92
In hindsight, was that a failure to control your ego?

15
00:00:37.92 --> 00:00:40.28
So your ego doesn't control you.

16
00:00:40.28 --> 00:00:42.80
I didn't ask this question out of idle curiosity.

17
00:00:42.80 --> 00:00:46.48
A lot of folks in an active duty listed to the podcast and I'm concerned they might put

18
00:00:46.48 --> 00:00:47.48
themselves.

19
00:00:47.48 --> 00:00:51.84
Their teammates and their mission in jeopardy because of their ego's won't let them admit

20
00:00:51.84 --> 00:00:53.44
their too hot or too cold.

21
00:00:53.44 --> 00:00:54.44
All right.

22
00:00:54.44 --> 00:00:59.64
So good question.

23
00:00:59.64 --> 00:01:00.64
Good point.

24
00:01:00.64 --> 00:01:03.16
And there's definitely a big difference between being uncomfortably cold, right?

25
00:01:03.16 --> 00:01:08.56
Like you're just uncomfortably cold or uncomfortably hot or uncomfortably thirsty or

26
00:01:08.56 --> 00:01:10.20
hungry or whatever.

27
00:01:10.20 --> 00:01:14.96
And being in an actual state where you're putting the mission in jeopardy because you're

28
00:01:14.96 --> 00:01:18.20
too cold or hot or thirsty or whatever.

29
00:01:18.20 --> 00:01:20.12
So I just needed to say this.

30
00:01:20.12 --> 00:01:28.96
In the teams, you are 95% of the time you are cold, too cold, too hot, too wet, too

31
00:01:28.96 --> 00:01:31.16
thirsty, too miserable, something.

32
00:01:31.16 --> 00:01:32.16
There's no time.

33
00:01:32.16 --> 00:01:35.44
When you're in the field, you put on a hundred pounds worse or worse or worse or worse

34
00:01:35.44 --> 00:01:36.04
or worse or worse or worse or worse or worse or worse.

35
00:01:36.04 --> 00:01:39.56
You're uncomfortable from the word go.

36
00:01:39.56 --> 00:01:41.04
From the word go.

37
00:01:41.04 --> 00:01:43.56
And you're cold.

38
00:01:43.56 --> 00:01:45.20
You come in over the beach.

39
00:01:45.20 --> 00:01:47.24
You're in wet camis.

40
00:01:47.24 --> 00:01:48.24
It doesn't matter.

41
00:01:48.24 --> 00:01:49.80
You come out with great technology.

42
00:01:49.80 --> 00:01:51.04
We got to dry suit of this.

43
00:01:51.04 --> 00:01:52.04
We got to wet suit that.

44
00:01:52.04 --> 00:01:54.36
No, you're miserable.

45
00:01:54.36 --> 00:01:55.56
You're going to be cold.

46
00:01:55.56 --> 00:01:56.68
You're going to be uncomfortable.

47
00:01:56.68 --> 00:01:58.96
You're riding a zodiac.

48
00:01:58.96 --> 00:02:04.76
First you're riding a big rib, which is like a 10 meter boat.

49
00:02:04.76 --> 00:02:07.04
And you have your zodiacs on that boat.

50
00:02:07.04 --> 00:02:07.80
So you're in that boat.

51
00:02:07.80 --> 00:02:09.36
You're getting sprayed with water.

52
00:02:09.36 --> 00:02:11.16
You're getting bounced up and down.

53
00:02:11.16 --> 00:02:13.56
You do that for three hours.

54
00:02:13.56 --> 00:02:15.56
And then you launch your little boats into the water.

55
00:02:15.56 --> 00:02:17.56
Well, while you're doing that, you fall in the water.

56
00:02:17.56 --> 00:02:20.44
You slip, you get sprayed more, you're covered in water.

57
00:02:20.44 --> 00:02:23.04
By the way, the water's not warm.

58
00:02:23.04 --> 00:02:26.32
And then you've got to, because you're going to travel then 15 knots.

59
00:02:26.32 --> 00:02:31.84
So you've got to feel facing a 15 knot headwind for the another two hours in a zodiac.

60
00:02:31.84 --> 00:02:34.08
And then you're going to get in the water and swim both between.

61
00:02:34.08 --> 00:02:35.92
You're going to be cold.

62
00:02:35.92 --> 00:02:37.92
That's just the way it is.

63
00:02:37.92 --> 00:02:39.88
And you can't complain about that.

64
00:02:39.88 --> 00:02:41.40
So and you don't complain about it.

65
00:02:41.40 --> 00:02:43.64
In the teams, you just keep your mouth shut.

66
00:02:43.64 --> 00:02:44.64
That's what you do.

67
00:02:44.64 --> 00:02:45.64
Keep your mouth shut.

68
00:02:45.64 --> 00:02:48.32
The big distinction here is this is correct.

69
00:02:48.32 --> 00:02:52.44
If you're going to get high pithermia or you're going to get a heat stroke or you're going

70
00:02:52.44 --> 00:02:55.88
to go down from dehydration, then yeah, you've got to speak up and be, you're going to say,

71
00:02:55.88 --> 00:02:56.88
hey, guess what?

72
00:02:56.88 --> 00:02:58.40
I got an issue here.

73
00:02:58.40 --> 00:03:02.92
I'm starting to get dizzy or I'm starting to get lightheaded or whatever.

74
00:03:02.92 --> 00:03:08.80
Yeah, if you cross the line to where it goes from discomfort to actual problem, then you

75
00:03:08.80 --> 00:03:13.80
definitely need to speak up.

76
00:03:13.80 --> 00:03:14.80
It does happen.

77
00:03:14.80 --> 00:03:15.80
It happens a lot actually.

78
00:03:15.80 --> 00:03:23.04
When we do our land warfare training in the desert, in the summertime, it's 120 degree heat.

79
00:03:23.04 --> 00:03:24.04
You're going to take heat catch.

80
00:03:24.04 --> 00:03:27.92
Please, when I was running training, we used to just have premeditated heat casualties

81
00:03:27.92 --> 00:03:28.92
evacuation.

82
00:03:28.92 --> 00:03:30.48
Because we knew someone was going to go down.

83
00:03:30.48 --> 00:03:33.04
That's just the way it's going to happen.

84
00:03:33.04 --> 00:03:38.40
Because you've got 40 guys that are all turning and burning and they're all running on

85
00:03:38.40 --> 00:03:40.36
three or four hours of sleep.

86
00:03:40.36 --> 00:03:44.44
And then they're going out in the field and they just got back from the field and there's

87
00:03:44.44 --> 00:03:46.44
no time to rehydrate.

88
00:03:46.44 --> 00:03:50.60
Okay, there's time, but some guys might forget to rehydrate.

89
00:03:50.60 --> 00:03:52.92
Next thing you know, you've got to go down.

90
00:03:52.92 --> 00:03:56.48
The stuff does happen.

91
00:03:56.48 --> 00:03:59.80
Yeah, you've got to let your team know it's going on.

92
00:03:59.80 --> 00:04:07.60
The closest call I had, I was on a long patrol training patrol in the Ozark Mountains

93
00:04:07.60 --> 00:04:10.96
of Arkansas, it was summertime, it was hot.

94
00:04:10.96 --> 00:04:14.60
We were planning to pump water, meaning you bring a little water filtration system into

95
00:04:14.60 --> 00:04:17.44
the field and you get to a stream and you can fill your canteens and it's great and

96
00:04:17.44 --> 00:04:20.24
it seems like you have water forever because it streams.

97
00:04:20.24 --> 00:04:25.72
Well, the way the patrol went, we started off in pairs and then we linked up with fire

98
00:04:25.72 --> 00:04:28.56
team and then we linked up with squad and then you look up with a platoon.

99
00:04:28.56 --> 00:04:34.36
Well while we were in the squad, link up, we, for whatever reason, the course that I was

100
00:04:34.36 --> 00:04:38.40
on, I didn't hit water, we had a couple of streams that were supposed to be there and

101
00:04:38.40 --> 00:04:40.84
they weren't because they're intermittent streams.

102
00:04:40.84 --> 00:04:44.88
So sometimes streams aren't running year round and the time of year it was, the streams

103
00:04:44.88 --> 00:04:45.88
weren't running.

104
00:04:45.88 --> 00:04:49.88
So the first one, I was like, okay, okay, got to, so you'll up over a mountain, come

105
00:04:49.88 --> 00:04:52.96
back down the other side, get to this where the stream is marked intermittent stream

106
00:04:52.96 --> 00:04:54.44
is marked on a map.

107
00:04:54.44 --> 00:04:56.40
Guess what, no stream.

108
00:04:56.40 --> 00:04:59.32
So by that time I was out of water.

109
00:04:59.32 --> 00:05:04.12
So now coming, the next day, I said to myself, you know, if there's not water on this

110
00:05:04.12 --> 00:05:09.48
next stream, I'm gonna, I'm gonna have issues and then it wasn't water the next day.

111
00:05:09.48 --> 00:05:14.64
So yeah, that's, but I started to feel the dehydration coming on me.

112
00:05:14.64 --> 00:05:16.60
That's why I hate being thirsty.

113
00:05:16.60 --> 00:05:19.96
I always carry as much water as I can.

114
00:05:19.96 --> 00:05:21.56
You gotta be paranoid about being thirsty.

115
00:05:21.56 --> 00:05:25.000
Once you start going down from a dehydration, it's really a bad situation.

116
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.84
You went the whole day?

117
00:05:26.84 --> 00:05:27.84
No, it was two days.

118
00:05:27.84 --> 00:05:32.64
Yeah, I had water going in, but I didn't have a ton of water.

119
00:05:32.64 --> 00:05:39.48
I should have had one, well, I should have maybe two more meters of water as a, as a just in case.

120
00:05:39.48 --> 00:05:41.08
But I didn't, I didn't, I didn't carry.

121
00:05:41.08 --> 00:05:42.52
Yeah, because you gotta carry it.

122
00:05:42.52 --> 00:05:44.12
Now you're heavier, now you're sweating more.

123
00:05:44.12 --> 00:05:47.08
So there's a little balance, you gotta figure it out.

124
00:05:47.08 --> 00:05:49.76
But yeah, you can't be a problem.

125
00:05:49.76 --> 00:05:53.60
Yes, I have seen it become a problem where guys, egos too big.

126
00:05:53.60 --> 00:05:54.80
They don't want to admit it for sure.

127
00:05:54.80 --> 00:05:56.92
So yes, this is a good warning.

128
00:05:56.92 --> 00:06:00.12
Don't let your ego get you in real trouble because that's gonna hurt your platoon even

129
00:06:00.12 --> 00:06:01.36
more.

130
00:06:01.36 --> 00:06:03.08
So don't let that happen.

131
00:06:03.08 --> 00:06:09.12
Don't let your ego prevent you from telling the truth about what's happening.

132
00:06:09.12 --> 00:06:13.68
And this happens in, this is gonna happen in the business world too.

133
00:06:13.68 --> 00:06:15.52
Where, oh, you know what?

134
00:06:15.52 --> 00:06:18.96
I don't really know how to operate this piece of equipment, but I'm not gonna say anything.

135
00:06:18.96 --> 00:06:20.24
I'm just gonna try and do it.

136
00:06:20.24 --> 00:06:21.88
Well, that's how someone gets hurt.

137
00:06:21.88 --> 00:06:23.52
So again, that's an ego problem.

138
00:06:23.52 --> 00:06:26.44
When you have an issue, when you know you can't do something or you've never done something

139
00:06:26.44 --> 00:06:30.72
before, step up and raise your hand.

140
00:06:30.72 --> 00:06:34.32
Now of course, you should have done the research, you should have, you know, you should have

141
00:06:34.32 --> 00:06:36.52
figured some stuff out on your own.

142
00:06:36.52 --> 00:06:40.60
But if you failed to do that, don't dig the whole deeper.

143
00:06:40.60 --> 00:06:42.80
Raise your hand, say what the problem was.

144
00:06:42.80 --> 00:06:43.80
There you go.

145
00:06:43.80 --> 00:06:44.80
Good question.

146
00:06:44.80 --> 00:06:45.80
Yeah, make sense.

147
00:06:45.80 --> 00:06:50.36
Because especially the thirst thing, like the dehydration thing, yeah, you don't want

148
00:06:50.36 --> 00:06:53.28
to be the guy saying, oh, I'm thirst.

149
00:06:53.28 --> 00:06:58.80
Here's the, I think nowadays though, like teams and coaches, here's the thing in football.

150
00:06:58.80 --> 00:07:02.08
So pop one or football, they'd be like, yeah, no water.

151
00:07:02.08 --> 00:07:03.36
You know, we have a water break.

152
00:07:03.36 --> 00:07:04.56
You drink water at the water break.

153
00:07:04.56 --> 00:07:05.76
Otherwise you're practicing.

154
00:07:05.76 --> 00:07:06.44
You know, kind of thing.

155
00:07:06.44 --> 00:07:07.84
It's like a tough and you're up thing.

156
00:07:07.84 --> 00:07:10.000
But man, that can jam your health up.

157
00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.44
Yeah, but let's face it.

158
00:07:11.44 --> 00:07:13.64
I mean, it would be pretty rare.

159
00:07:13.64 --> 00:07:17.92
If you gave people the, if you're doing a practice, what the how long is a practice last

160
00:07:17.92 --> 00:07:18.92
two hours?

161
00:07:18.92 --> 00:07:22.000
Okay, bro, you can make it two hours.

162
00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.84
If you're properly hydrated now, if a person's not properly hydrated, going into the

163
00:07:25.84 --> 00:07:27.96
practice, sure, that can, that can be a problem.

164
00:07:27.96 --> 00:07:32.72
But if someone is properly hydrated, going into the situation, it should not be a problem.

165
00:07:32.72 --> 00:07:36.60
And I'll say what, if you are in the military and you're going in the field, man, pre-hydrate

166
00:07:36.60 --> 00:07:41.32
like that, you used to save me so much from carrying so much water, just drinks so much

167
00:07:41.32 --> 00:07:42.32
water.

168
00:07:42.32 --> 00:07:45.72
Now, take where the problem comes in, you're in a helicopter ride for an hour and a half.

169
00:07:45.72 --> 00:07:46.72
Yeah.

170
00:07:46.72 --> 00:07:48.04
And you got to piss so bad.

171
00:07:48.04 --> 00:07:49.04
Yeah.

172
00:07:49.04 --> 00:07:50.04
It's awful.

173
00:07:50.04 --> 00:07:51.92
Well, you know what, bring a little, bring a little plastic bottle with you.

174
00:07:51.92 --> 00:07:53.16
So you can piss into the bottle.

175
00:07:53.16 --> 00:07:54.16
That's the way less of an issue.

176
00:07:54.16 --> 00:07:57.84
I think, like, finding a place to drink versus, for sure.

177
00:07:57.84 --> 00:07:58.84
It's way to be able to have to.

178
00:07:58.84 --> 00:08:03.76
But yeah, if you pre-hydrate properly, no matter how hard you're working, you can go

179
00:08:03.76 --> 00:08:06.24
like 12 hours without any water.

180
00:08:06.24 --> 00:08:07.64
Which is pretty legit.

181
00:08:07.64 --> 00:08:11.72
For, you know, kind of an average seal mission, 12 hours, get your brilliant plenty of

182
00:08:11.72 --> 00:08:12.72
time.

183
00:08:12.72 --> 00:08:13.72
Yeah.

184
00:08:13.72 --> 00:08:15.44
But kid, I mean, I'm talking pop warning here.

185
00:08:15.44 --> 00:08:17.44
So, you know, we're on a no-gjog.

186
00:08:17.44 --> 00:08:18.44
We're not talking to you.

187
00:08:18.44 --> 00:08:19.44
We're talking pop warning.

188
00:08:19.44 --> 00:08:20.44
Yeah.

189
00:08:20.44 --> 00:08:22.16
But here's the weird thing.

190
00:08:22.16 --> 00:08:26.60
Like when you went to high school college, they'd have water right there, right there

191
00:08:26.60 --> 00:08:27.60
on the sideline.

192
00:08:27.60 --> 00:08:31.24
And they, you know, they're really aware of, hey, you need good, you need water, drink

193
00:08:31.24 --> 00:08:32.24
more water.

194
00:08:32.24 --> 00:08:33.24
Well, I think that was also the time.

195
00:08:33.24 --> 00:08:35.24
Yeah, that's the, actually the point.

196
00:08:35.24 --> 00:08:37.24
The era, the era, right?

197
00:08:37.24 --> 00:08:42.60
Like, when we were kids, no one ever, ever, one single time in my whole, from the time

198
00:08:42.60 --> 00:08:45.96
I was zero until I was 18.

199
00:08:45.96 --> 00:08:49.12
No one ever said to me, hey, make sure you drink water.

200
00:08:49.12 --> 00:08:51.12
Never, never heard anyone say that.

201
00:08:51.12 --> 00:08:53.48
It was like, oh, you're thirsty drink a Coke.

202
00:08:53.48 --> 00:08:56.16
You know, that's the way it was.

203
00:08:56.16 --> 00:08:58.40
So that changed for you in that time period.

204
00:08:58.40 --> 00:08:59.40
Yeah.

205
00:08:59.40 --> 00:09:03.16
When I got to, when I got to seal training, when I got a buds, that's when they were

206
00:09:03.16 --> 00:09:06.52
saying, oh, you're going to stay hydrated.

207
00:09:06.52 --> 00:09:07.52
I thought it was kind of a joke.

208
00:09:07.52 --> 00:09:08.92
I thought they were getting hit first.

209
00:09:08.92 --> 00:09:09.92
Yeah, nuts.

210
00:09:09.92 --> 00:09:11.72
Like, what do you tell them about hydrogen, you mean drink water?

211
00:09:11.72 --> 00:09:12.72
What do you mean?

212
00:09:12.72 --> 00:09:13.92
Why would you call it something else?

213
00:09:13.92 --> 00:09:14.92
Hydrated.

214
00:09:14.92 --> 00:09:15.92
Yeah.

215
00:09:15.92 --> 00:09:16.92
What are your thirst ever?

216
00:09:16.92 --> 00:09:17.92
Yeah.

217
00:09:17.92 --> 00:09:20.12
Like, it's like this mate, will you shut?

218
00:09:20.12 --> 00:09:24.20
Because you can go down from like heat, kid, this like for there's heat exhaustion.

219
00:09:24.20 --> 00:09:25.20
Heat stroke, heat exhaustion.

220
00:09:25.20 --> 00:09:26.20
Yeah.

221
00:09:26.20 --> 00:09:27.20
And heat.

222
00:09:27.20 --> 00:09:28.20
There's all kinds of heat injuries you can get.

223
00:09:28.20 --> 00:09:29.20
Yeah.

224
00:09:29.20 --> 00:09:30.56
And you get heat stroke, but you can straight up die.

225
00:09:30.56 --> 00:09:31.56
Oh, yeah.

226
00:09:31.56 --> 00:09:34.60
So that's not, you know, it's not a matter of like, oh, yeah, tough it out.

227
00:09:34.60 --> 00:09:35.76
But you can't tough it out.

228
00:09:35.76 --> 00:09:36.76
You're shutting down.

229
00:09:36.76 --> 00:09:37.76
Kind of big.

230
00:09:37.76 --> 00:09:38.76
That's for sure.

231
00:09:38.76 --> 00:09:39.76
So, you know, that is important.

232
00:09:39.76 --> 00:09:40.76
It's for the heat thing.

233
00:09:40.76 --> 00:09:41.76
And I guess that is.

234
00:09:41.76 --> 00:09:42.76
That is.

235
00:09:42.76 --> 00:09:44.52
And that's going back to this question.

236
00:09:44.52 --> 00:09:50.76
That is probably why we would see heat casualties in training because guys do not want

237
00:09:50.76 --> 00:09:51.76
to say anything.

238
00:09:51.76 --> 00:09:52.76
They're like man, I'm not going to say anything.

239
00:09:52.76 --> 00:09:53.76
Yeah.

240
00:09:53.76 --> 00:09:54.76
I'm not going to get it now.

241
00:09:54.76 --> 00:09:55.76
Keep it worse.

242
00:09:55.76 --> 00:09:56.76
That's what happened.

243
00:09:56.76 --> 00:09:58.76
You could stuck with an IV now you're laying in the field.

244
00:09:58.76 --> 00:10:03.52
Everyone else, by the way, continues on doing another 10 kilometer hump to a target.

245
00:10:03.52 --> 00:10:07.16
And you're sitting there laid up in the ambulance like a little baby.

246
00:10:07.16 --> 00:10:09.000
No one wants that.

247
00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.12
But if you pre-high-pre-high-pre-high-pre-prop, you won't be in that situation.

248
00:10:12.12 --> 00:10:13.12
Yeah.

249
00:10:13.12 --> 00:10:16.52
But if you are going to get that situation, you need to say something.

250
00:10:16.52 --> 00:10:17.52
Yeah.

251
00:10:17.52 --> 00:10:19.40
We're talking about your life.

252
00:10:19.40 --> 00:10:20.40
Yeah.

253
00:10:20.40 --> 00:10:21.40
Essentially.

254
00:10:21.40 --> 00:10:22.40
And more important.

255
00:10:22.40 --> 00:10:23.40
We're talking about the mission.

256
00:10:23.40 --> 00:10:24.40
Yeah.

257
00:10:24.40 --> 00:10:27.000
I'm still thinking about the potworn of situation.

258
00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.000
Yeah, man.

259
00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.64
I dig it and you are correct.

260
00:10:29.64 --> 00:10:30.64
I can't help it.

261
00:10:30.64 --> 00:10:33.40
I agree with you 100%.

262
00:10:33.40 --> 00:10:34.40
That question.

263
00:10:34.40 --> 00:10:35.40
Jockel.

264
00:10:35.40 --> 00:10:37.32
Dear Jockel.

265
00:10:37.32 --> 00:10:43.16
My chosen community has lost and continues to lose members due to suicide.

266
00:10:43.16 --> 00:10:46.36
One reason is that they don't ask for help.

267
00:10:46.36 --> 00:10:51.84
I think one reason they don't ask for help is that they're afraid of being or being seen

268
00:10:51.84 --> 00:10:53.84
as weak.

269
00:10:53.84 --> 00:10:59.16
Somewhere that this takes strength and discipline to be able to perceive when you need help

270
00:10:59.16 --> 00:11:00.56
and to ask for it.

271
00:11:00.56 --> 00:11:03.36
I don't know how to convey that to them.

272
00:11:03.36 --> 00:11:07.56
Could you address how one can gather support from their team without losing face?

273
00:11:07.56 --> 00:11:11.20
So there's an obvious reason why I paired these two questions together because they're both

274
00:11:11.20 --> 00:11:13.52
very, very similar.

275
00:11:13.52 --> 00:11:15.84
And it's the same thing.

276
00:11:15.84 --> 00:11:20.88
And if we don't, if a member of your team won't come forward and admit they haven't

277
00:11:20.88 --> 00:11:23.76
issued, then the issue is not going to get addressed.

278
00:11:23.76 --> 00:11:26.36
And this is the same exact thing they have to explain to your team.

279
00:11:26.36 --> 00:11:31.72
Like, hey, if you start going down because you're dehydrated or you're starting getting

280
00:11:31.72 --> 00:11:37.36
getting frostbite and you need to get warmed up, you need to say something.

281
00:11:37.36 --> 00:11:40.84
If you don't say something, that's going to hurt the whole team.

282
00:11:40.84 --> 00:11:42.40
That's what's bad.

283
00:11:42.40 --> 00:11:44.20
So I think that's important.

284
00:11:44.20 --> 00:11:48.96
I think that's important to make sure everyone understands that this part of being a good

285
00:11:48.96 --> 00:11:54.000
operator is knowing your limitations and when you reach your limitations, raising your hand

286
00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.28
and saying, hey, this is a problem.

287
00:11:57.28 --> 00:12:03.32
And believe me, there's guys that might complain about little things and they're eventually

288
00:12:03.32 --> 00:12:06.64
going to be labeled as a little complainer, right?

289
00:12:06.64 --> 00:12:08.68
And they don't really have issues.

290
00:12:08.68 --> 00:12:10.76
So there's a fine line, right?

291
00:12:10.76 --> 00:12:12.36
There's a fine line.

292
00:12:12.36 --> 00:12:20.08
But for someone that's having some kind of mental stress, well, again, we got to recognize

293
00:12:20.08 --> 00:12:21.08
what's going on.

294
00:12:21.08 --> 00:12:24.12
We got to recognize that it's impacting us negatively at work.

295
00:12:24.12 --> 00:12:25.32
So that means you got to raise your hand.

296
00:12:25.32 --> 00:12:28.16
If it's having a negative impact on the way you're performing, then you got to raise your

297
00:12:28.16 --> 00:12:29.16
hand.

298
00:12:29.16 --> 00:12:35.60
And I think it's important to explain to people that this is something that happens to

299
00:12:35.60 --> 00:12:37.60
can happen to everybody.

300
00:12:37.60 --> 00:12:39.08
And it's not a negative thing.

301
00:12:39.08 --> 00:12:40.68
It's just a reality.

302
00:12:40.68 --> 00:12:44.60
It's kind of like it reminds me of being afraid, right?

303
00:12:44.60 --> 00:12:51.16
And if you're, let's say you got a new guy that's never done anything before and he doesn't

304
00:12:51.16 --> 00:12:56.36
know that he's going to be afraid, going on an operation, then he's going to wonder why

305
00:12:56.36 --> 00:13:00.92
a stomach is upset or why he's second guess himself or why he can't sleep.

306
00:13:00.92 --> 00:13:02.76
Like, oh, you can't sleep.

307
00:13:02.76 --> 00:13:03.76
Guess what?

308
00:13:03.76 --> 00:13:04.76
That's normal.

309
00:13:04.76 --> 00:13:07.76
You're going on a hardcore combat operation tomorrow.

310
00:13:07.76 --> 00:13:11.04
The fact that you can't sleep is completely normal. The fact that you feel sick, your stomach

311
00:13:11.04 --> 00:13:12.16
is completely normal.

312
00:13:12.16 --> 00:13:14.52
The fact that you're, you're, you're shaking.

313
00:13:14.52 --> 00:13:15.52
Those things are normal.

314
00:13:15.52 --> 00:13:16.52
Like, you're going to feel those.

315
00:13:16.52 --> 00:13:17.52
That's okay.

316
00:13:17.52 --> 00:13:19.48
It's not that big of a deal.

317
00:13:19.48 --> 00:13:21.04
And those things are just fear.

318
00:13:21.04 --> 00:13:22.52
That's what they are.

319
00:13:22.52 --> 00:13:28.20
And if you know what they are and you know that fear is okay and it's acceptable and it's

320
00:13:28.20 --> 00:13:30.32
actually kind of good, right?

321
00:13:30.32 --> 00:13:36.76
Because if, if you're not feeling any fear whatsoever, then you know, you've got some, well,

322
00:13:36.76 --> 00:13:38.20
you should be feeling afraid.

323
00:13:38.20 --> 00:13:39.48
You should feel fear.

324
00:13:39.48 --> 00:13:40.84
That should, that should propel you.

325
00:13:40.84 --> 00:13:42.48
It should get you on edge.

326
00:13:42.48 --> 00:13:44.88
Those are all those things are actually happening for a reason.

327
00:13:44.88 --> 00:13:47.08
So there's nothing wrong with that.

328
00:13:47.08 --> 00:13:50.28
And I think that's the same thing that you got to explain to people with stress.

329
00:13:50.28 --> 00:13:53.04
Like, oh, okay, that you can have too much fear.

330
00:13:53.04 --> 00:13:57.000
You keep someone at that heightened state for an extended period of time.

331
00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:01.28
Well, that's called combat stress and it's real and it can happen.

332
00:14:01.28 --> 00:14:02.28
It can happen anyone.

333
00:14:02.28 --> 00:14:03.28
And you know what?

334
00:14:03.28 --> 00:14:08.52
Because if we talked about on this podcast where you can see stress, combat stress taking

335
00:14:08.52 --> 00:14:10.08
it's toll on people.

336
00:14:10.08 --> 00:14:15.12
And when it does, you know, we've talked about it many times.

337
00:14:15.12 --> 00:14:20.88
If you get to that point, you need a break and dick winners from Banda Brothers.

338
00:14:20.88 --> 00:14:24.60
You know, he would give those guys breaks without them even knowing that he was given

339
00:14:24.60 --> 00:14:25.60
a break.

340
00:14:25.60 --> 00:14:28.64
Hey, echo, you got to go back and do a little logistics run for four days.

341
00:14:28.64 --> 00:14:30.92
Just make sure we have more supplies coming away.

342
00:14:30.92 --> 00:14:33.24
Get you off the front line, get you a breather.

343
00:14:33.24 --> 00:14:38.56
So that way, again, the same metaphor I've used before is if you have an engine in the

344
00:14:38.56 --> 00:14:41.000
red and you keep running it, what's going to happen in the engine?

345
00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:42.000
It's going to burn out.

346
00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:43.000
It's not going to be usable.

347
00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.32
If you have someone that's psychologically stressed and they're in the red and you keep

348
00:14:46.32 --> 00:14:47.64
running them in the red, guess what?

349
00:14:47.64 --> 00:14:49.08
Eventually they're not going to be usable anymore.

350
00:14:49.08 --> 00:14:51.60
So you need to give them a break, get them off the line.

351
00:14:51.60 --> 00:14:55.32
Because if you do take an engine, if you're engine like check engine like comes on and you

352
00:14:55.32 --> 00:14:58.92
go and get it maintained, get it fixed, the engine's still good.

353
00:14:58.92 --> 00:15:00.92
If you keep running it, the engine will be destroyed.

354
00:15:00.92 --> 00:15:02.32
So you got to do that with your people.

355
00:15:02.32 --> 00:15:06.04
You got to make sure everybody knows and I think that's a real simple metaphor to use

356
00:15:06.04 --> 00:15:07.04
with people as well.

357
00:15:07.04 --> 00:15:11.64
Say, look, we're running hard and we're going to put some stress on the engine.

358
00:15:11.64 --> 00:15:14.28
And if you don't keep the engine maintained, the engine's going to break and you won't

359
00:15:14.28 --> 00:15:15.28
be any good to the team.

360
00:15:15.28 --> 00:15:16.92
You won't be any good for the mission.

361
00:15:16.92 --> 00:15:21.72
So if you start feeling your engine like go on, you got to let someone know so we can

362
00:15:21.72 --> 00:15:23.52
give you the proper maintenance.

363
00:15:23.52 --> 00:15:24.52
And that's it.

364
00:15:24.52 --> 00:15:25.52
Jody Middick talked about that too.

365
00:15:25.52 --> 00:15:32.28
Jody was saying, hey, you know, basically if you get injured, if you break your ankle,

366
00:15:32.28 --> 00:15:34.68
they don't just expect you just to keep going.

367
00:15:34.68 --> 00:15:38.44
No, like, okay, you need to get back and you need to rehab while the same thing can happen

368
00:15:38.44 --> 00:15:39.44
to your brain.

369
00:15:39.44 --> 00:15:41.56
Your brain gets a break in it.

370
00:15:41.56 --> 00:15:44.48
You don't just keep driving or it's going to fracture a fall apart.

371
00:15:44.48 --> 00:15:45.48
What do you do?

372
00:15:45.48 --> 00:15:46.72
You take a break.

373
00:15:46.72 --> 00:15:53.20
You get down time and you get recovered and then you'll be ready to rock and roll again.

374
00:15:53.20 --> 00:15:56.04
So two really good questions to start it off.

375
00:15:56.04 --> 00:15:59.04
You know, again, especially for folks out there on the battlefield.

376
00:15:59.04 --> 00:16:04.12
And then it's not just for people on the battlefield because it happens with any group of

377
00:16:04.12 --> 00:16:05.72
people that are in a stressful environment.

378
00:16:05.72 --> 00:16:10.28
I mean, obviously cops get put into a really stressful environment all the time.

379
00:16:10.28 --> 00:16:14.88
Well, if you need to take a breather, you need to say something before you, before you

380
00:16:14.88 --> 00:16:15.96
burn out the engine.

381
00:16:15.96 --> 00:16:16.96
Yeah.

382
00:16:16.96 --> 00:16:18.76
Same thing with business world, right?

383
00:16:18.76 --> 00:16:21.12
People in the business world get extremely stressed out.

384
00:16:21.12 --> 00:16:23.96
Well, you probably need to break at some point.

385
00:16:23.96 --> 00:16:26.24
Make sure you work that in there.

386
00:16:26.24 --> 00:16:34.76
You don't like, like, police have like a mandatory program or mandatory situation where,

387
00:16:34.76 --> 00:16:37.44
you know, you go through, I think we're like, when they shoot someone or something like

388
00:16:37.44 --> 00:16:40.76
that, like mandatory, you have to go to like some kind of like counseling.

389
00:16:40.76 --> 00:16:42.76
Yeah, most of them do now or yeah.

390
00:16:42.76 --> 00:16:43.76
Yeah.

391
00:16:43.76 --> 00:16:49.68
So that makes sense too because even if let's say you don't necessarily need it or whatever,

392
00:16:49.68 --> 00:16:52.68
right, you go through a shooting situation, you got to go a mandatory and then, oh,

393
00:16:52.68 --> 00:16:53.68
I got to go through it.

394
00:16:53.68 --> 00:16:59.32
It's good that everyone kind of does it because it seems like, oh, it takes away the negative

395
00:16:59.32 --> 00:17:03.12
this deep, you know, like, kind of like, oh, I'm the only guy.

396
00:17:03.12 --> 00:17:05.48
You know, I'm the only guy that apparently feels this way.

397
00:17:05.48 --> 00:17:06.48
I'm looking around.

398
00:17:06.48 --> 00:17:07.92
No one else is going to counseling.

399
00:17:07.92 --> 00:17:08.92
Yeah.

400
00:17:08.92 --> 00:17:09.92
And now I'm the only guy.

401
00:17:09.92 --> 00:17:10.92
I must be the weak guy.

402
00:17:10.92 --> 00:17:11.92
So I don't, I'm not saying that.

403
00:17:11.92 --> 00:17:15.28
Yeah, they've done that somewhat in the military of, hey, when you come home from the

404
00:17:15.28 --> 00:17:21.32
planet, everyone's going to go talk to talk to, what is it a psychotherapy or something?

405
00:17:21.32 --> 00:17:22.32
Yeah.

406
00:17:22.32 --> 00:17:24.20
Just they kind of do that.

407
00:17:24.20 --> 00:17:28.28
I know they did that in the school teams where they'd be everyone would go, they didn't

408
00:17:28.28 --> 00:17:29.28
do all I was in.

409
00:17:29.28 --> 00:17:33.36
They'd give it, you like a piece of paper to fill out, which everyone just got in a gun

410
00:17:33.36 --> 00:17:34.36
decked.

411
00:17:34.36 --> 00:17:36.88
You know, what does that mean?

412
00:17:36.88 --> 00:17:37.88
Yeah.

413
00:17:37.88 --> 00:17:38.88
Just pencil whip.

414
00:17:38.88 --> 00:17:39.88
I don't know what, I don't know.

415
00:17:39.88 --> 00:17:42.48
It just like, you know, fill it out except for Tony.

416
00:17:42.48 --> 00:17:45.20
You know, Tony wrote on the head of his, what?

417
00:17:45.20 --> 00:17:47.68
He wrote, this is a cry for help.

418
00:17:47.68 --> 00:17:51.92
That was pretty funny.

419
00:17:51.92 --> 00:17:56.12
But anyways, that was, he filled out like a whole fake one about just a funny one.

420
00:17:56.12 --> 00:17:57.12
Yeah.

421
00:17:57.12 --> 00:17:58.12
Dang.

422
00:17:58.12 --> 00:17:59.60
I got a fake out of it.

423
00:17:59.60 --> 00:18:00.60
Yeah.

424
00:18:00.60 --> 00:18:02.64
But it makes sense, though, because of that.

425
00:18:02.64 --> 00:18:05.60
Because that's kind of the, that's really the most important way to do things.

426
00:18:05.60 --> 00:18:06.60
It's the smart way to do things.

427
00:18:06.60 --> 00:18:10.88
Let's give everyone a baseline sort of, okay, check.

428
00:18:10.88 --> 00:18:11.88
Here you go.

429
00:18:11.88 --> 00:18:12.88
Yeah.

430
00:18:12.88 --> 00:18:14.68
And that way, no one has to go.

431
00:18:14.68 --> 00:18:16.60
No one has to take raise their hand first.

432
00:18:16.60 --> 00:18:17.60
Yeah.

433
00:18:17.60 --> 00:18:18.60
You're all going to talk to somebody.

434
00:18:18.60 --> 00:18:19.60
I think it's a smart thing to do.

435
00:18:19.60 --> 00:18:20.60
Yeah.

436
00:18:20.60 --> 00:18:21.60
Yeah.

437
00:18:21.60 --> 00:18:23.16
Because it's kind of the thing, right?

438
00:18:23.16 --> 00:18:25.56
It kind of goes along with the earlier question too.

439
00:18:25.56 --> 00:18:30.24
Like, if it's a water break and hey, guys, water break, everyone's drinking water.

440
00:18:30.24 --> 00:18:37.24
So now it's like, you don't have to feel like, the one plus who like needs this water.

441
00:18:37.24 --> 00:18:38.24
Oh, yeah.

442
00:18:38.24 --> 00:18:39.24
Yeah.

443
00:18:39.24 --> 00:18:40.24
Oh, yeah.

444
00:18:40.24 --> 00:18:41.24
No, no.

445
00:18:41.24 --> 00:18:42.24
That's the exact same thing.

446
00:18:42.24 --> 00:18:43.24
Yeah.

447
00:18:43.24 --> 00:18:44.24
So yeah.

448
00:18:44.24 --> 00:18:46.12
If you got an issue man, speak up.

449
00:18:46.12 --> 00:18:49.08
Everyone knows, you know, that way you can do your job.

450
00:18:49.08 --> 00:18:50.08
You can do it longer.

451
00:18:50.08 --> 00:18:51.08
You can do it better.

452
00:18:51.08 --> 00:18:57.56
Your goal is to do the, is to be the best possible that you, be the best possible capability

453
00:18:57.56 --> 00:19:00.08
so that you can go out and do your job the best.

454
00:19:00.08 --> 00:19:03.88
If you've, if you've got issues, you've got to say something so that you can keep doing

455
00:19:03.88 --> 00:19:05.36
your job for the team.

456
00:19:05.36 --> 00:19:06.36
Yeah.

457
00:19:06.36 --> 00:19:10.16
It's like, like, don't look at yourself as being weak.

458
00:19:10.16 --> 00:19:13.36
Look at yourself is trying to optimize your strength kind of go.

459
00:19:13.36 --> 00:19:16.56
You know, maybe just a flip over the way you look at it.

460
00:19:16.56 --> 00:19:17.88
There it is.

461
00:19:17.88 --> 00:19:18.88
Next question.

462
00:19:18.88 --> 00:19:23.72
Do you think martial arts tournaments are the most effective way for preparing for

463
00:19:23.72 --> 00:19:25.36
physical confrontation?

464
00:19:25.36 --> 00:19:31.24
I just competed my second due to tournament as a three straight white belt.

465
00:19:31.24 --> 00:19:36.60
In one match, I completely lost focus and control of my mind because I believe I was taken

466
00:19:36.60 --> 00:19:43.08
a back by the strength and wildness of my opponent in a big 100%.

467
00:19:43.08 --> 00:19:47.84
I barely, I can barely even remember how the match unfolded.

468
00:19:47.84 --> 00:19:52.000
I've given this match significant thought and I concluded that I need to compete more.

469
00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:55.88
I'm very comfortable with everyone in my academy.

470
00:19:55.88 --> 00:19:59.48
I trust that as I roll with without question, they're like family now.

471
00:19:59.48 --> 00:20:03.16
The guy, the guy in the tournament was a total stranger.

472
00:20:03.16 --> 00:20:06.08
He was unknown and therefore he listed fear.

473
00:20:06.08 --> 00:20:09.88
I allowed myself to be crippled by fear.

474
00:20:09.88 --> 00:20:13.40
Is there any other way to overcome this beyond competing tournaments?

475
00:20:13.40 --> 00:20:14.40
Thank you.

476
00:20:14.40 --> 00:20:17.40
All right.

477
00:20:17.40 --> 00:20:21.04
You know, competing is definitely part of it.

478
00:20:21.04 --> 00:20:25.40
And it's interesting that he's asking if this is the most effective way to prepare for

479
00:20:25.40 --> 00:20:27.88
a physical confrontation.

480
00:20:27.88 --> 00:20:34.12
It is a very good way to help you prepare for a physical confrontation.

481
00:20:34.12 --> 00:20:35.52
And the bottom line is competing.

482
00:20:35.52 --> 00:20:41.88
One of the things that's true with competing and it's true with anything is that the

483
00:20:41.88 --> 00:20:48.68
more familiar you are with the unfamiliar, the more familiar it will become.

484
00:20:48.68 --> 00:20:53.64
I know that sounds pretty obvious, but the more familiar you are with the unfamiliar, the

485
00:20:53.64 --> 00:20:55.44
more familiar it will become.

486
00:20:55.44 --> 00:20:58.56
So you get to become familiar with things that are unfamiliar.

487
00:20:58.56 --> 00:21:03.08
And you learn how to handle things that you aren't expecting.

488
00:21:03.08 --> 00:21:08.56
In the teams, we always talk about your first free fall jump when you learn how to skydive

489
00:21:08.56 --> 00:21:10.68
with the free fall rig.

490
00:21:10.68 --> 00:21:15.12
And your first jump seems like it's like three seconds long, even though it's a minute.

491
00:21:15.12 --> 00:21:18.60
Even though it's a minute because you're all amped up and you all you see is your

492
00:21:18.60 --> 00:21:22.12
altimeter and the more you jump the more you see.

493
00:21:22.12 --> 00:21:26.16
Until that minute, I mean, have you ever tried to hold your breath for a minute?

494
00:21:26.16 --> 00:21:28.84
That's like a long time, right?

495
00:21:28.84 --> 00:21:33.92
But and that's that's the amount of time that can take up a free fall can be a nice

496
00:21:33.92 --> 00:21:36.32
long minute where you're observing all these different things.

497
00:21:36.32 --> 00:21:39.20
But when you first start doing it, it doesn't seem very long.

498
00:21:39.20 --> 00:21:45.08
I'm sure if we had Andy, Andy Stumpfon here, his one minute free fall price seems like

499
00:21:45.08 --> 00:21:50.44
a really, really long time because he's got thousands of of jumps.

500
00:21:50.44 --> 00:21:59.84
And so this is the same thing, the more you train for chaos, the more accustomed you're

501
00:21:59.84 --> 00:22:01.84
going to become to the chaos.

502
00:22:01.84 --> 00:22:05.80
Now what's great is in this particular case, he's talking about this guy's just wild and

503
00:22:05.80 --> 00:22:10.04
crazy and hey, if you survive it that first time, well, the next time someone goes wild

504
00:22:10.04 --> 00:22:12.08
and crazy, like, okay, well, here's what I need to do.

505
00:22:12.08 --> 00:22:13.36
I need to put this in check.

506
00:22:13.36 --> 00:22:14.36
I need to hold on.

507
00:22:14.36 --> 00:22:17.64
I need to make sure he, I don't give any positions, but I'm not going to get crazy.

508
00:22:17.64 --> 00:22:22.80
I'm just going to absorb some, you go through that mental drill and the more you go through

509
00:22:22.80 --> 00:22:26.000
that mental drill, the better you will get at it.

510
00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:27.000
And this is true.

511
00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:28.44
This is true with anything.

512
00:22:28.44 --> 00:22:32.60
And that's why, you know, when I was running the sales training, we put the, we would

513
00:22:32.60 --> 00:22:34.08
make it.

514
00:22:34.08 --> 00:22:37.92
So we'd hit people with the most random possible things because that's what prepares you

515
00:22:37.92 --> 00:22:40.40
for random possible things is random possible things.

516
00:22:40.40 --> 00:22:42.08
That's what you want to deal with.

517
00:22:42.08 --> 00:22:46.72
It's kind of weird, you know, in Gjitsu, Dean, Dean, you used to talk about this.

518
00:22:46.72 --> 00:22:49.44
And now you can hear John Donner talking about it as well.

519
00:22:49.44 --> 00:22:56.88
And if, if you have never been in a certain situation before, you're not ready for it.

520
00:22:56.88 --> 00:23:02.88
And when, okay, so there's a, there's a position in, in Gjitsu called 5050, right?

521
00:23:02.88 --> 00:23:04.56
That's what it's called now.

522
00:23:04.56 --> 00:23:09.28
We used to call it Kakaraco because that's the position that Dean was in when he beat

523
00:23:09.28 --> 00:23:13.48
a guy named Kakaraco for the ADCC, World Championships.

524
00:23:13.48 --> 00:23:20.92
And Dean, Dean calls that position 9010 because he's been in it so much that even though

525
00:23:20.92 --> 00:23:25.56
it's a neutral position, meaning we both have the same advantages and disadvantages.

526
00:23:25.56 --> 00:23:29.04
When Dean's in that position, he's been in it so much that he's got a 90% chance.

527
00:23:29.04 --> 00:23:34.24
He's got a 90% chance to success because he's been there 10 times, 20 times, 30 times

528
00:23:34.24 --> 00:23:35.24
more than you.

529
00:23:35.24 --> 00:23:38.44
And I heard John Donner talking about the same thing the other day.

530
00:23:38.44 --> 00:23:45.56
He's getting his, his Gjitsu fighters right now are doing things to guys that are, that

531
00:23:45.56 --> 00:23:48.40
they're putting people in positions that the person's not used to.

532
00:23:48.40 --> 00:23:49.84
So if you're not used to it, guess what?

533
00:23:49.84 --> 00:23:52.72
You're an advantage, even though I might have trained, even though let's say I'm a Gjitsu

534
00:23:52.72 --> 00:23:54.20
Black belt.

535
00:23:54.20 --> 00:23:56.04
And I've been training for 20 years.

536
00:23:56.04 --> 00:24:01.96
If I've never been in this particular position before, it's, I might as well be a white belt

537
00:24:01.96 --> 00:24:02.96
mechanism.

538
00:24:02.96 --> 00:24:04.12
You can see that happening.

539
00:24:04.12 --> 00:24:05.68
You can see that happening in Gjitsu.

540
00:24:05.68 --> 00:24:11.44
That's why when somebody comes up with a new, new type of moves, that move can be effective

541
00:24:11.44 --> 00:24:12.44
for a little while.

542
00:24:12.44 --> 00:24:14.32
Like let's say you came up with a new move.

543
00:24:14.32 --> 00:24:16.88
You might catch me in that new move one time.

544
00:24:16.88 --> 00:24:18.92
And then I go, I know what he did.

545
00:24:18.92 --> 00:24:24.04
But now, if instead of just a new move, you had a whole new area that I had to learn.

546
00:24:24.04 --> 00:24:26.44
Yeah, then I had to learn a whole new deal.

547
00:24:26.44 --> 00:24:29.60
It's the same thing with Eddie Bravo and 10th planet.

548
00:24:29.60 --> 00:24:33.44
You know, like they were doing things like, oh, I've never been in this position before.

549
00:24:33.44 --> 00:24:35.24
Now what do I do?

550
00:24:35.24 --> 00:24:37.32
They were catching guys like that.

551
00:24:37.32 --> 00:24:40.72
And then the more people figure out that part of that system.

552
00:24:40.72 --> 00:24:44.000
Okay, well, then you get better at it and we get to a neutral ground again.

553
00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:49.44
But anytime you can, so in training, anytime you can get to be put yourself in a situation

554
00:24:49.44 --> 00:24:52.12
that you haven't been before, it's going to be beneficial to you.

555
00:24:52.12 --> 00:24:56.56
Now what is, how does this translate to real physical confrontations?

556
00:24:56.56 --> 00:24:57.56
Right?

557
00:24:57.56 --> 00:24:58.96
How do you train for that?

558
00:24:58.96 --> 00:25:01.96
Well, how often are you putting on gloves and Gjitsu?

559
00:25:01.96 --> 00:25:03.96
How often are you having somebody punch you in the face?

560
00:25:03.96 --> 00:25:07.52
How often are you having somebody come up and push you around?

561
00:25:07.52 --> 00:25:11.60
How often are you having people do things that people can do in a street fight?

562
00:25:11.60 --> 00:25:12.60
Right?

563
00:25:12.60 --> 00:25:15.88
People are going to do in a street fight that they wouldn't normally do in a Gjitsu match.

564
00:25:15.88 --> 00:25:16.88
Right?

565
00:25:16.88 --> 00:25:20.28
For instance, in a street fight is anyone ever start on the knees?

566
00:25:20.28 --> 00:25:21.28
Right?

567
00:25:21.28 --> 00:25:22.28
They don't start on the knees.

568
00:25:22.28 --> 00:25:24.92
They don't start on the knees and street fight.

569
00:25:24.92 --> 00:25:27.88
You don't say, hey, you want to fight me and then you didn't get down on your knees.

570
00:25:27.88 --> 00:25:28.88
And so does the other guy.

571
00:25:28.88 --> 00:25:29.88
Now we figure out what happens.

572
00:25:29.88 --> 00:25:32.76
No, street fights don't start on the knees.

573
00:25:32.76 --> 00:25:37.68
So you're almost, and people ask me this, actually somebody asks me the other day, what

574
00:25:37.68 --> 00:25:39.24
should I do when starting from the knees?

575
00:25:39.24 --> 00:25:40.24
What's a good take down?

576
00:25:40.24 --> 00:25:41.60
I'm like, oh, my God, pull guard.

577
00:25:41.60 --> 00:25:43.000
Because why are you on your knees?

578
00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:45.72
The best thing to do if your opponent is on their knees, stand up and kick them in the

579
00:25:45.72 --> 00:25:46.72
face.

580
00:25:46.72 --> 00:25:47.72
Right?

581
00:25:47.72 --> 00:25:51.92
You're not going to be, why would you be on your knees?

582
00:25:51.92 --> 00:25:53.08
Yeah.

583
00:25:53.08 --> 00:25:54.68
So don't practice that.

584
00:25:54.68 --> 00:26:00.92
So how do you prepare for the best way to prepare for these combat situations is, is

585
00:26:00.92 --> 00:26:02.20
Gjitsu tournament a good way?

586
00:26:02.20 --> 00:26:03.36
Yes, it is a good way.

587
00:26:03.36 --> 00:26:06.32
Is boxing is boxing a good way?

588
00:26:06.32 --> 00:26:07.72
Is it good to do a smokers?

589
00:26:07.72 --> 00:26:10.84
So you figure out what it's like when somebody, you want to talk about someone going

590
00:26:10.84 --> 00:26:12.32
wild with you.

591
00:26:12.32 --> 00:26:16.28
You get someone that's untrained in boxing come thrown, thrown, you know, windmill

592
00:26:16.28 --> 00:26:18.52
hammakers at you, 38 in a row.

593
00:26:18.52 --> 00:26:22.28
Now they're going to be exhausted after that first 32 seconds.

594
00:26:22.28 --> 00:26:28.08
But you will have had to have withstand and not get punched in the head.

595
00:26:28.08 --> 00:26:29.08
Yeah.

596
00:26:29.08 --> 00:26:31.44
Because if you get punched in the head by a wild hammaker, I don't care who you are.

597
00:26:31.44 --> 00:26:34.92
If they connect with your chin, there's a possibility you might go down.

598
00:26:34.92 --> 00:26:36.60
So you need to be careful that.

599
00:26:36.60 --> 00:26:41.92
So don't just think, oh, just Gjitsu, hey, go out, train some boxing, train some

600
00:26:41.92 --> 00:26:44.88
moitai and go in sparr.

601
00:26:44.88 --> 00:26:51.08
And if you can do a smokers because smokers pretty easy to do, in other words, you don't

602
00:26:51.08 --> 00:26:56.76
need to do like a full preparation camp and all that.

603
00:26:56.76 --> 00:26:57.76
Yeah.

604
00:26:57.76 --> 00:26:59.16
It's an unofficial event.

605
00:26:59.16 --> 00:27:03.72
So you go do a smokers and you're going to experience somebody going wild on you, throwing

606
00:27:03.72 --> 00:27:06.88
haymakers at you, throwing crazy kicks at you.

607
00:27:06.88 --> 00:27:11.24
Do that, do all these things to get ready for those physical competitions.

608
00:27:11.24 --> 00:27:16.000
And then you also on top of that, you read and you look at YouTube videos.

609
00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:17.000
Go watch YouTube.

610
00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:18.000
I've talked about this before.

611
00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:21.20
Go watch YouTube videos and street fights because you get to see what people, what

612
00:27:21.20 --> 00:27:26.52
kind of things people do, which can be very effective.

613
00:27:26.52 --> 00:27:27.52
Right?

614
00:27:27.52 --> 00:27:28.92
So learn to watch out for soccer punches.

615
00:27:28.92 --> 00:27:32.56
You need to learn to watch out, watch your back and watch your sneaking up on you and

616
00:27:32.56 --> 00:27:34.76
be aware of your surroundings and put your back against the wall.

617
00:27:34.76 --> 00:27:37.000
You know, there's all these little things that you can do to make sure that you're not

618
00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:39.60
going to get soccer punched.

619
00:27:39.60 --> 00:27:41.44
But you got to pay attention to those things.

620
00:27:41.44 --> 00:27:42.44
Yeah.

621
00:27:42.44 --> 00:27:43.44
Yeah.

622
00:27:43.44 --> 00:27:46.44
That wildness that he talks about.

623
00:27:46.44 --> 00:27:47.44
Yeah.

624
00:27:47.44 --> 00:27:49.92
That is a huge thing.

625
00:27:49.92 --> 00:27:56.52
It's like a whole another factor, especially in exactly how he said he's real, he's real familiar

626
00:27:56.52 --> 00:27:58.20
with his training partners.

627
00:27:58.20 --> 00:28:02.32
So man, you know, the amount of cruising and kind of relax and even during the role,

628
00:28:02.32 --> 00:28:06.000
there's probably significant amount of it almost to the point where it seems like anyway

629
00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:11.52
where he kind of maybe expects that or even subconsciously kind of he understands that

630
00:28:11.52 --> 00:28:13.000
that's kind of part of the deal.

631
00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:17.04
You go against a complete stranger and he gets wild.

632
00:28:17.04 --> 00:28:20.12
And it's like, whoa, this is like, it's kind of overwhelming.

633
00:28:20.12 --> 00:28:21.12
Yeah.

634
00:28:21.12 --> 00:28:26.48
And also, even at the three stripe white belt level, this other guy,

635
00:28:26.48 --> 00:28:29.20
he may, he's got his little game.

636
00:28:29.20 --> 00:28:31.44
He's got his game that he plays.

637
00:28:31.44 --> 00:28:35.000
And there's a chance that as a three stripe white belt, you haven't learned that part

638
00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:36.000
of the game.

639
00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:37.40
So it just feels crazy.

640
00:28:37.40 --> 00:28:38.40
Yeah.

641
00:28:38.40 --> 00:28:42.08
And that whole, you know, when you compete for the first second time, you know, just a

642
00:28:42.08 --> 00:28:43.08
little earlier.

643
00:28:43.08 --> 00:28:47.48
See, that as the thing is, the more you train, the less holes there are.

644
00:28:47.48 --> 00:28:48.48
Yeah.

645
00:28:48.48 --> 00:28:49.48
Right.

646
00:28:49.48 --> 00:28:50.48
The less holes you are.

647
00:28:50.48 --> 00:28:51.48
There are in your game.

648
00:28:51.48 --> 00:28:56.24
And so if you're a three stripe white belt, you might not have good guard

649
00:28:56.24 --> 00:28:57.72
replacement, right?

650
00:28:57.72 --> 00:29:00.68
Like you really haven't learned how to replace the guard from cross side.

651
00:29:00.68 --> 00:29:01.36
Yeah.

652
00:29:01.36 --> 00:29:05.32
Well, if this guy happens to be a guy that holds really well across the

653
00:29:05.32 --> 00:29:06.88
side, and that's where he works his game from.

654
00:29:06.88 --> 00:29:07.88
Man, you're a big trouble.

655
00:29:07.88 --> 00:29:08.88
Yeah.

656
00:29:08.88 --> 00:29:09.88
You're a big trouble.

657
00:29:09.88 --> 00:29:10.88
Yeah.

658
00:29:10.88 --> 00:29:14.24
And it all seems so unpredictable too at those earlier stages, because you don't know

659
00:29:14.24 --> 00:29:15.24
where your holes are.

660
00:29:15.24 --> 00:29:17.24
I mean, you might know some, but you don't know.

661
00:29:17.24 --> 00:29:18.24
Yeah.

662
00:29:18.24 --> 00:29:19.76
You know, you haven't seen enough of the game.

663
00:29:19.76 --> 00:29:24.56
And you haven't been in enough situations where you can kind of stay calm and, you know,

664
00:29:24.56 --> 00:29:25.56
all the stuff.

665
00:29:25.56 --> 00:29:30.20
So to your point where you say you got to be familiar with the unfamiliar kind of thing.

666
00:29:30.20 --> 00:29:33.84
Remember when Majeed started just baseball bat choking everyone?

667
00:29:33.84 --> 00:29:34.84
Yeah.

668
00:29:34.84 --> 00:29:35.84
How was Lea's?

669
00:29:35.84 --> 00:29:36.84
Yeah.

670
00:29:36.84 --> 00:29:37.84
He's live weird setups.

671
00:29:37.84 --> 00:29:40.84
And he would let people pass his guard and then he'd be thinking, oh, I'm about to

672
00:29:40.84 --> 00:29:43.60
score some points on the and boom, they're getting tapped out.

673
00:29:43.60 --> 00:29:44.60
Yeah.

674
00:29:44.60 --> 00:29:48.44
But it was so foreign that, okay.

675
00:29:48.44 --> 00:29:51.92
So he went the two real, real famous ones at the time when he exploded on the

676
00:29:51.92 --> 00:29:53.36
scene with these was.

677
00:29:53.36 --> 00:29:55.72
He was Clark and Zach.

678
00:29:55.72 --> 00:29:56.72
Yeah.

679
00:29:56.72 --> 00:30:02.12
Back to the two matches and one of them Zach Maxwell mounted in Armbar.

680
00:30:02.12 --> 00:30:06.40
No, hasn't been the Armbar meanwhile baseball, but, yeah, choke is in.

681
00:30:06.40 --> 00:30:07.72
No, but who cares?

682
00:30:07.72 --> 00:30:11.52
Because really that rule could not, not rule, but that situation up kind of applies.

683
00:30:11.52 --> 00:30:13.16
If you have someone in Armbar, I don't care.

684
00:30:13.16 --> 00:30:14.16
You should be.

685
00:30:14.16 --> 00:30:15.16
Yep.

686
00:30:15.16 --> 00:30:16.16
I got the armbar to break your arm.

687
00:30:16.16 --> 00:30:18.92
He's going for the arm, but he can't lean back because the baseball, that

688
00:30:18.92 --> 00:30:21.28
choke is in and he's like, he got a tap.

689
00:30:21.28 --> 00:30:22.28
Yeah.

690
00:30:22.28 --> 00:30:27.08
And then I think he was Clark where he could have been the other way around, but

691
00:30:27.08 --> 00:30:29.88
either way, Clark has a, was Zach was going to block it.

692
00:30:29.88 --> 00:30:31.60
I was at these matches, weren't I?

693
00:30:31.60 --> 00:30:32.60
I know I was.

694
00:30:32.60 --> 00:30:33.60
Yeah, I wasn't.

695
00:30:33.60 --> 00:30:34.60
I was there by.

696
00:30:34.60 --> 00:30:39.24
So the videos, but yeah, the kind where Clark was like, I know this choke, I'm in

697
00:30:39.24 --> 00:30:40.88
mount or I'm in this good position.

698
00:30:40.88 --> 00:30:42.80
I know that this choke doesn't work.

699
00:30:42.80 --> 00:30:46.08
It simply doesn't work because I have the advantage and he gets choked unconscious because

700
00:30:46.08 --> 00:30:47.08
he doesn't tap.

701
00:30:47.08 --> 00:30:48.08
Sure, it might hurt.

702
00:30:48.08 --> 00:30:50.92
And that is the case for a lot of the, a lot of jokes where it's like, sure, this

703
00:30:50.92 --> 00:30:51.92
hurt.

704
00:30:51.92 --> 00:30:52.92
It's not a choke.

705
00:30:52.92 --> 00:30:54.16
No, a good one doesn't even hurt.

706
00:30:54.16 --> 00:30:55.16
Yeah, it's a good choke.

707
00:30:55.16 --> 00:30:56.16
It's just in.

708
00:30:56.16 --> 00:30:57.16
Yeah.

709
00:30:57.16 --> 00:30:58.96
So what we're talking about there is a guy named Mijid.

710
00:30:58.96 --> 00:31:00.16
What's Mijid's last name?

711
00:31:00.16 --> 00:31:01.16
He's.

712
00:31:01.16 --> 00:31:02.16
Yeah, that's right.

713
00:31:02.16 --> 00:31:05.36
And he came on to the scene.

714
00:31:05.36 --> 00:31:06.76
We'll say.

715
00:31:06.76 --> 00:31:07.76
Sure.

716
00:31:07.76 --> 00:31:11.04
With, well, this is what's interesting about this is the baseball bat choke is not a new

717
00:31:11.04 --> 00:31:12.04
choke.

718
00:31:12.04 --> 00:31:14.92
It's not a domain that people were unfamiliar with.

719
00:31:14.92 --> 00:31:20.24
It's just that he was doing it really, really well with really good setups that people,

720
00:31:20.24 --> 00:31:22.20
that's what, that's the part that people weren't expecting.

721
00:31:22.20 --> 00:31:23.56
It was a really good setup.

722
00:31:23.56 --> 00:31:26.20
They were really good setups of people weren't expecting.

723
00:31:26.20 --> 00:31:30.64
And so he'd let people pass their guard or his guard.

724
00:31:30.64 --> 00:31:31.64
But he had the choke in.

725
00:31:31.64 --> 00:31:33.92
They'd get across side and get mounted or whatever.

726
00:31:33.92 --> 00:31:39.16
Go for arm locks and they're tapping because they weren't expecting it.

727
00:31:39.16 --> 00:31:40.16
Yeah.

728
00:31:40.16 --> 00:31:45.32
And even if those, you know, I mean, Zach Maxwell and Clark Gracie, just phenomenal competitors

729
00:31:45.32 --> 00:31:50.88
Black belt, I mean, been training their whole lives, both of them got caught by that.

730
00:31:50.88 --> 00:31:51.88
Yeah, he's.

731
00:31:51.88 --> 00:31:59.88
Yeah, the legitimacy of like the way that whole thing went down was just so astounding.

732
00:31:59.88 --> 00:32:02.24
Like just like how you say, like Clark?

733
00:32:02.24 --> 00:32:03.24
Yeah.

734
00:32:03.24 --> 00:32:05.84
But Clark has been winning stuff from day one.

735
00:32:05.84 --> 00:32:06.84
That's when it's in.

736
00:32:06.84 --> 00:32:07.84
Yeah.

737
00:32:07.84 --> 00:32:13.08
And yeah, it's just crazy, but it just shows, you know, where you can, you can be that good.

738
00:32:13.08 --> 00:32:16.16
You get just that one teeny tiny window of familiarity.

739
00:32:16.16 --> 00:32:18.32
Yeah, that's what they got creeps in there.

740
00:32:18.32 --> 00:32:20.88
And he's familiar, but he'll just have his way.

741
00:32:20.88 --> 00:32:25.40
And then what was interesting is as people started knowing that that's what he's going

742
00:32:25.40 --> 00:32:26.40
to go for.

743
00:32:26.40 --> 00:32:27.40
But he'd still get it.

744
00:32:27.40 --> 00:32:28.40
Yeah.

745
00:32:28.40 --> 00:32:32.68
And actually, and I trained with him before, he had just, you know, a few times or whatever.

746
00:32:32.68 --> 00:32:35.16
And he didn't do that to me.

747
00:32:35.16 --> 00:32:38.60
And I was like, hey, you know, like, well, I didn't have some why didn't do it to me.

748
00:32:38.60 --> 00:32:42.56
But I was like, do people, you know, like, does everyone ask you to teach them or

749
00:32:42.56 --> 00:32:46.20
do he's like, you know what, people don't, I don't even really talk about anymore because

750
00:32:46.20 --> 00:32:51.80
I've become so well known for that move that it becomes, it became less a part of my life.

751
00:32:51.80 --> 00:32:52.80
Yeah.

752
00:32:52.80 --> 00:32:59.000
It could happen to where, okay, now once you go, okay, it goes through a phase of, hey,

753
00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:00.96
I wasn't expecting that.

754
00:33:00.96 --> 00:33:02.36
And it worked because I wasn't expecting it.

755
00:33:02.36 --> 00:33:06.08
Then it goes like, hey, I was expecting it, but it still worked.

756
00:33:06.08 --> 00:33:08.44
But then it gets to a point where people are just going, I'm not going to do it.

757
00:33:08.44 --> 00:33:10.64
Like, oh, if he grabs my collar, I need to go.

758
00:33:10.64 --> 00:33:14.84
It totally different direction. I need to not do anything, need to back out whatever.

759
00:33:14.84 --> 00:33:19.84
And then it becomes where, like you said, it's now it's losing some of its effectiveness

760
00:33:19.84 --> 00:33:23.76
because everyone is expecting that to be the move that you do.

761
00:33:23.76 --> 00:33:29.04
That's what happened with the 100% like where there'd be like, I don't care what position

762
00:33:29.04 --> 00:33:31.64
I mean, I don't care what position I have to give up.

763
00:33:31.64 --> 00:33:34.24
It's just do not get into that leglock position.

764
00:33:34.24 --> 00:33:37.64
It's like, you could tell with some of his matches, I was like, oh, yeah, she did.

765
00:33:37.64 --> 00:33:38.64
I get it.

766
00:33:38.64 --> 00:33:41.64
You know, I get it, but you have that is how it goes.

767
00:33:41.64 --> 00:33:46.24
But the chaos thing, I think he should compete more.

768
00:33:46.24 --> 00:33:47.64
Yes, that should compete more.

769
00:33:47.64 --> 00:33:53.36
For sure. But what I'm saying is compete in Gigiitsu for sure, but do some smokers, do some

770
00:33:53.36 --> 00:33:59.32
mojitai, do some wrestling matches, do some sombo turn, you know, get out there, do some different

771
00:33:59.32 --> 00:34:04.64
competitions and then on top of all that, man, do some scenario based training.

772
00:34:04.64 --> 00:34:10.64
You know, do some self defense based training at the Academy where somebody pulls out the

773
00:34:10.64 --> 00:34:15.72
the knife, the fake knife, whatever, what do they call the fake knife and like, let's make

774
00:34:15.72 --> 00:34:17.12
sure we know how to deal with that.

775
00:34:17.12 --> 00:34:19.12
Let's make sure we know how to deal with the baseball bat.

776
00:34:19.12 --> 00:34:20.12
Like, what are you going to do?

777
00:34:20.12 --> 00:34:21.12
What are you going to do?

778
00:34:21.12 --> 00:34:24.12
Because baseball bat, you know what you do with the baseball bat, close the distance.

779
00:34:24.12 --> 00:34:25.12
Yeah.

780
00:34:25.12 --> 00:34:30.48
You know, hey, that's not even really a game changer as long as you know what you're doing.

781
00:34:30.48 --> 00:34:33.16
Knife, close the distance with a knife and now you're getting stabbed.

782
00:34:33.16 --> 00:34:34.16
Yes.

783
00:34:34.16 --> 00:34:36.16
So, you got to make distance.

784
00:34:36.16 --> 00:34:37.16
Yeah.

785
00:34:37.16 --> 00:34:41.72
And again, man, that just that familiarity, like, once you go through it, that's like almost

786
00:34:41.72 --> 00:34:43.40
night and day and end of itself.

787
00:34:43.40 --> 00:34:47.12
Once you've seen it, if you've never seen it, if you've seen it once, like, that first

788
00:34:47.12 --> 00:34:48.12
step is night and day.

789
00:34:48.12 --> 00:34:49.84
So, that's good that he went through this.

790
00:34:49.84 --> 00:34:50.84
Really?

791
00:34:50.84 --> 00:34:51.84
Yeah.

792
00:34:51.84 --> 00:34:52.84
Yeah.

793
00:34:52.84 --> 00:34:55.12
And what's good, the other good, psychologically, you know, do you recognize psychologically,

794
00:34:55.12 --> 00:34:57.12
he recognized that he lost his mind?

795
00:34:57.12 --> 00:34:58.12
I got what he said.

796
00:34:58.12 --> 00:35:01.48
He said, uh, he did fear.

797
00:35:01.48 --> 00:35:03.12
Yeah, I got fear.

798
00:35:03.12 --> 00:35:06.12
Oh, is it?

799
00:35:06.12 --> 00:35:09.36
In one match, I completely lost focus and control of my mind.

800
00:35:09.36 --> 00:35:13.96
So, once you, that's just, and what you just said, when you get that, when you experience

801
00:35:13.96 --> 00:35:17.72
that, that's a good thing to experience because then you learn to recognize that you're

802
00:35:17.72 --> 00:35:22.60
losing control and you're losing your mind and you're going to, when you realize that, it

803
00:35:22.60 --> 00:35:24.48
allows you to start monitoring it.

804
00:35:24.48 --> 00:35:25.48
Yeah.

805
00:35:25.48 --> 00:35:27.52
You've never been to, because there's people that are listening to this right now that have

806
00:35:27.52 --> 00:35:28.88
never lost their mind before.

807
00:35:28.88 --> 00:35:30.60
They've never been overwhelmed by something.

808
00:35:30.60 --> 00:35:33.80
And just not knowing what to do, never been frozen.

809
00:35:33.80 --> 00:35:35.76
You've never been frozen with fear.

810
00:35:35.76 --> 00:35:36.76
Frozen with fear.

811
00:35:36.76 --> 00:35:41.32
If you've never felt your fight or flight thing engaged, then when it happens, you won't

812
00:35:41.32 --> 00:35:42.32
know what it is.

813
00:35:42.32 --> 00:35:43.32
Yeah.

814
00:35:43.32 --> 00:35:44.56
You want to know what it is.

815
00:35:44.56 --> 00:35:47.48
So that way when it happens, you can go, okay, know what's happening right here.

816
00:35:47.48 --> 00:35:48.48
Yeah.

817
00:35:48.48 --> 00:35:50.32
I'm going to make this, I'm going to make this decision.

818
00:35:50.32 --> 00:35:51.32
Yeah.

819
00:35:51.32 --> 00:35:58.48
And how you're saying, when you train boxing or, um, um, boxing, yeah, yeah, and MMA.

820
00:35:58.48 --> 00:36:01.52
So when you get hit in the face, when we talked about this before, when you get hit in the

821
00:36:01.52 --> 00:36:04.20
face, then you have it really been hit in the face before.

822
00:36:04.20 --> 00:36:07.48
Like, that's a, it'll throw you off.

823
00:36:07.48 --> 00:36:08.48
Oh, yeah.

824
00:36:08.48 --> 00:36:10.48
That's just to put really mildly it'll throw you off.

825
00:36:10.48 --> 00:36:15.96
So especially, yeah, you're right, because when you see someone get punched in the face

826
00:36:15.96 --> 00:36:20.000
and moving it, it seems like it doesn't really face in that match and they keep going.

827
00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:22.36
If that's what your expect is going to happen when you get punched in the face,

828
00:36:22.36 --> 00:36:23.36
that's the wrong idea.

829
00:36:23.36 --> 00:36:24.36
Yeah.

830
00:36:24.36 --> 00:36:26.48
Because what's going to, if you've never been punched in the face before when you get punched,

831
00:36:26.48 --> 00:36:27.80
it's a little shocker.

832
00:36:27.80 --> 00:36:28.80
Yeah.

833
00:36:28.80 --> 00:36:32.44
And there's pain and your eyes get blurry and you're, you get a little flash.

834
00:36:32.44 --> 00:36:35.000
I mean, there's a lot of things that go on when you get punched in the face.

835
00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:37.76
Once you get used to it, you're like, you can move right through it.

836
00:36:37.76 --> 00:36:38.76
Exactly.

837
00:36:38.76 --> 00:36:40.44
But if you're not used to it, it's a problem.

838
00:36:40.44 --> 00:36:41.44
Yeah.

839
00:36:41.44 --> 00:36:42.44
Fully.

840
00:36:42.44 --> 00:36:43.76
And it's, that's another one.

841
00:36:43.76 --> 00:36:48.04
It's night and day when a guy has been hit in the face a bunch of times and is used

842
00:36:48.04 --> 00:36:49.56
to it and a guy who's not used to it.

843
00:36:49.56 --> 00:36:56.32
Because, you know, like, you can hit a guy in a face or get hit in the face and they'll

844
00:36:56.32 --> 00:36:57.32
be like, I'm done.

845
00:36:57.32 --> 00:37:02.56
Like, I didn't really expect this encounter or this experience.

846
00:37:02.56 --> 00:37:03.56
You don't want to get it.

847
00:37:03.56 --> 00:37:04.76
And then, oh, they guys, they'll get hit in the face.

848
00:37:04.76 --> 00:37:07.56
Break their nose, break their jaw, all this stuff and they're keep fighting.

849
00:37:07.56 --> 00:37:09.56
You know, it's like, dang.

850
00:37:09.56 --> 00:37:13.36
So that night in a situation, if you're not used to it, which is essentially the same

851
00:37:13.36 --> 00:37:14.36
thing you went through.

852
00:37:14.36 --> 00:37:15.36
This guy went wild.

853
00:37:15.36 --> 00:37:20.56
He wasn't ready for this overwhelming experience and he losses my instinctive.

854
00:37:20.56 --> 00:37:21.56
Yeah.

855
00:37:21.56 --> 00:37:22.56
So you can hit in the face.

856
00:37:22.56 --> 00:37:24.24
Like, I'm regret punching me in my face.

857
00:37:24.24 --> 00:37:25.24
So hard.

858
00:37:25.24 --> 00:37:30.76
I don't know if he was mad or just regretting.

859
00:37:30.76 --> 00:37:31.76
Great.

860
00:37:31.76 --> 00:37:34.48
James fires it off.

861
00:37:34.48 --> 00:37:36.20
He punched me right between the eyes.

862
00:37:36.20 --> 00:37:38.000
Thought he broke my face.

863
00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:40.84
And it was the kind where it was a timing thing too, where I came in.

864
00:37:40.84 --> 00:37:45.48
I was shooting in and right before a level change or whatever, he just connected and

865
00:37:45.48 --> 00:37:46.48
was like, boom.

866
00:37:46.48 --> 00:37:48.68
And I remember thinking, because I just kept going.

867
00:37:48.68 --> 00:37:51.92
And I remember thinking, dang, I'm glad I was kind of used to getting hit in the face.

868
00:37:51.92 --> 00:37:56.48
That would have kind of, the very least paused me for a long time, like, didn't you?

869
00:37:56.48 --> 00:38:01.96
But I'm thinking, when you imagine just that kind of chaos and sensation that'll just stop

870
00:38:01.96 --> 00:38:02.96
you.

871
00:38:02.96 --> 00:38:03.80
But once you're used to it, you're good.

872
00:38:03.80 --> 00:38:08.04
And this is a good point to bring up with just with any kind of training at like leadership

873
00:38:08.04 --> 00:38:09.20
training, right?

874
00:38:09.20 --> 00:38:13.000
When you have leaders that haven't been put in certain situations before, that's why I

875
00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:14.000
actually love front.

876
00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:16.000
We do role playing exercises with people.

877
00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:17.52
And you put people in situations.

878
00:38:17.52 --> 00:38:21.60
The first time you put them in situations like dealing with a hostile subordinate that

879
00:38:21.60 --> 00:38:23.44
doesn't want to do the plan.

880
00:38:23.44 --> 00:38:27.52
The first time they get put in that scenario, they just, they just fall apart.

881
00:38:27.52 --> 00:38:29.64
I told you to do it in here.

882
00:38:29.64 --> 00:38:31.52
Okay, let's replay that.

883
00:38:31.52 --> 00:38:36.68
By the third time you're doing it, already handling the job, handling the scenario infinitely

884
00:38:36.68 --> 00:38:39.96
better, infinitely better than they did the first time.

885
00:38:39.96 --> 00:38:44.84
So it's the same with everything in life, like the exposure to it and the rehearsal

886
00:38:44.84 --> 00:38:52.68
of it gives you such a massive advantage that to not rehearse and to not train is, it's

887
00:38:52.68 --> 00:38:54.40
actually sad.

888
00:38:54.40 --> 00:38:57.80
And that's actually, the National Enfronts are great example because that's why we're

889
00:38:57.80 --> 00:39:02.52
in business because people don't even know that they should be doing this.

890
00:39:02.52 --> 00:39:12.68
And to go to a company that has 50, 100, 150, 200 leaders that are leading teams and they

891
00:39:12.68 --> 00:39:14.76
have no leadership training.

892
00:39:14.76 --> 00:39:19.68
And therefore we're all surprised when the leader doesn't get the teams to do what they're

893
00:39:19.68 --> 00:39:20.68
supposed to do.

894
00:39:20.68 --> 00:39:21.68
Who taught him how to lead?

895
00:39:21.68 --> 00:39:25.84
Because you just don't show, you just don't show up to work, no one how to lead.

896
00:39:25.84 --> 00:39:27.52
No, you actually get trained to lead.

897
00:39:27.52 --> 00:39:31.68
Yeah, all these unfamiliar micro scenarios happen in.

898
00:39:31.68 --> 00:39:36.12
That's one of the, that's one of the, like, the muster we do these little drills at the

899
00:39:36.12 --> 00:39:37.12
muster.

900
00:39:37.12 --> 00:39:41.64
And you could see, people are overwhelmed with the knowledge that they gained from two

901
00:39:41.64 --> 00:39:44.16
or three little scenarios that we put in front of them.

902
00:39:44.16 --> 00:39:45.92
And these are common scenarios that happen all the time.

903
00:39:45.92 --> 00:39:51.92
But when you watch seasoned business leaders, trying to handle a scenario that they haven't

904
00:39:51.92 --> 00:39:52.92
seen before.

905
00:39:52.92 --> 00:39:56.24
Now they might have seen it before, but they never actually had to deal with it.

906
00:39:56.24 --> 00:39:58.84
The first time they try to deal with it, they fall apart.

907
00:39:58.84 --> 00:40:03.60
And it's real, I've been, it takes like 10 seconds before you go, okay, let's just stop.

908
00:40:03.60 --> 00:40:05.24
Because you've already got this guy mad at you.

909
00:40:05.24 --> 00:40:06.96
Well, let's try this again.

910
00:40:06.96 --> 00:40:09.16
Because we haven't been through this situation before.

911
00:40:09.16 --> 00:40:11.16
They never been punched in the face before.

912
00:40:11.16 --> 00:40:12.16
Yeah.

913
00:40:12.16 --> 00:40:13.84
And that's the problem.

914
00:40:13.84 --> 00:40:14.84
Don't let it happen.

915
00:40:14.84 --> 00:40:16.84
Get punched in the face a few times.

916
00:40:16.84 --> 00:40:17.84
Yeah.

917
00:40:17.84 --> 00:40:18.84
Just you be.

918
00:40:18.84 --> 00:40:19.84
Yeah.

919
00:40:19.84 --> 00:40:20.84
You can do this.

920
00:40:20.84 --> 00:40:23.44
It's kind of like, remember when we were kids, there was this, this is, you know, like,

921
00:40:23.44 --> 00:40:24.44
really chewing gum.

922
00:40:24.44 --> 00:40:25.44
Yeah.

923
00:40:25.44 --> 00:40:28.24
And then the little packs that for five of them, they're just small little thing.

924
00:40:28.24 --> 00:40:31.64
And you, you know, you grab one and this one kind of stick in now, you can say, hey, you

925
00:40:31.64 --> 00:40:33.52
know, do you want one off of one of your friends.

926
00:40:33.52 --> 00:40:36.16
So it was my brother.

927
00:40:36.16 --> 00:40:39.72
And he did, long story, but he was crying from something else who you said.

928
00:40:39.72 --> 00:40:40.72
And he was like crying.

929
00:40:40.72 --> 00:40:42.76
And oh, by the way, you know, he offered me some gum.

930
00:40:42.76 --> 00:40:43.76
I grabbed the gum.

931
00:40:43.76 --> 00:40:44.76
And then he was like, oh, those mouse traps.

932
00:40:44.76 --> 00:40:45.76
Yeah.

933
00:40:45.76 --> 00:40:48.76
And it slaps you and kind of hurts with your little kitty anyway.

934
00:40:48.76 --> 00:40:50.76
And it snaps off.

935
00:40:50.76 --> 00:40:54.08
I'm like, dang, I never, you know, I see he's laughing.

936
00:40:54.08 --> 00:40:55.76
You cry from something else.

937
00:40:55.76 --> 00:40:56.76
And then he's laughing.

938
00:40:56.76 --> 00:40:57.76
And cheer them up, whatever.

939
00:40:57.76 --> 00:40:58.76
Double leg.

940
00:40:58.76 --> 00:41:04.000
He's not there for, well, actually, which would have made the double leg even better.

941
00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:07.20
Nonetheless, I'd never seen that before.

942
00:41:07.20 --> 00:41:10.20
Now someone offers me riggedly gum.

943
00:41:10.20 --> 00:41:11.20
I'm aware.

944
00:41:11.20 --> 00:41:12.20
I'm ready for that mouse trap.

945
00:41:12.20 --> 00:41:14.20
It may be the mouse trap, maybe not.

946
00:41:14.20 --> 00:41:15.20
Well, you're grabbing by the side.

947
00:41:15.20 --> 00:41:17.20
I'm driving by the side exactly right.

948
00:41:17.20 --> 00:41:18.20
Let's learn.

949
00:41:18.20 --> 00:41:19.20
Yeah, exactly right.

950
00:41:19.20 --> 00:41:20.20
I'll have to endure that.

951
00:41:20.20 --> 00:41:23.20
And one more minute.

952
00:41:23.20 --> 00:41:25.20
Life is no different.

953
00:41:25.20 --> 00:41:27.20
Next question.

954
00:41:27.20 --> 00:41:30.20
I'm a chef in a large operation kitchen.

955
00:41:30.20 --> 00:41:34.48
I'm second in command overseeing a large kitchen staff in part of a five-person management

956
00:41:34.48 --> 00:41:37.20
team overseeing the entire account.

957
00:41:37.20 --> 00:41:41.20
Recently, during my last review, I was giving some advice by my boss and his boss.

958
00:41:41.20 --> 00:41:46.20
I'm unsure about my last two annual reviews have gone very well.

959
00:41:46.20 --> 00:41:48.20
And I'm on the rise in the company.

960
00:41:48.20 --> 00:41:53.20
However, they said, if it was important for me to get or heat the however, they said,

961
00:41:53.20 --> 00:42:03.20
it was important for me to give up some of my kitchen dog mentality and work to showcase my artistic

962
00:42:03.20 --> 00:42:07.20
side and embrace more of a star role in the spotlight.

963
00:42:07.20 --> 00:42:09.20
Get out of the kitchen a bit more.

964
00:42:09.20 --> 00:42:13.20
Get more more gain more exposure specifically with their high profile clients.

965
00:42:13.20 --> 00:42:18.20
While I appreciate their sentiment and respect their big management skills, their style

966
00:42:18.20 --> 00:42:24.20
isn't one I strive to emulate or feel would work for me and the way I operate.

967
00:42:24.20 --> 00:42:31.20
I've always approached my work as more of a craft than an art and I've always like being a trench dog

968
00:42:31.20 --> 00:42:32.20
with my team.

969
00:42:32.20 --> 00:42:37.20
My team responds to it and I get results for the business and I feel the results should speak for them

970
00:42:37.20 --> 00:42:39.20
and I feel the results are not.

971
00:42:39.20 --> 00:42:41.20
It is propelled my career rapidly thus far.

972
00:42:41.20 --> 00:42:44.20
So why would I want to change and be something I'm not?

973
00:42:44.20 --> 00:42:48.20
Should I heat their advice or stick to what I do best?

974
00:42:48.20 --> 00:42:51.20
Keep getting after it on my terms.

975
00:42:51.20 --> 00:42:53.20
What are those questions?

976
00:42:53.20 --> 00:42:58.20
That's just funny how that last statement is framed.

977
00:42:58.20 --> 00:43:02.20
Should I stick to what I do best and keep getting after it?

978
00:43:02.20 --> 00:43:07.20
As if to say if you say no you should not stick to what you do best.

979
00:43:07.20 --> 00:43:09.20
You should not get after it.

980
00:43:09.20 --> 00:43:14.20
That's the frame there and actually this guy I answered the question real

981
00:43:14.20 --> 00:43:18.20
Tercely I think this came through Facebook messages that I said.

982
00:43:18.20 --> 00:43:23.20
Sounds like you found a comfortable little zone for yourself and you want to stay in there.

983
00:43:23.20 --> 00:43:27.20
Right little cold butter response and he's like,

984
00:43:27.20 --> 00:43:29.20
I knew it.

985
00:43:29.20 --> 00:43:34.20
Because as we know in the comfort zone there's no growth in the comfort zone.

986
00:43:34.20 --> 00:43:43.20
So it's interesting this guy is actually getting some good solid and straightforward advice from up the chain of command.

987
00:43:43.20 --> 00:43:52.20
Plus I think if they have him as more of a personality than the restaurant will do better and they're trying to build their reputation and your reputation at the same time.

988
00:43:52.20 --> 00:43:55.20
And that seems pretty reasonable to me right?

989
00:43:55.20 --> 00:44:03.20
Real familiar with the restaurant business but I'm familiar enough to know if you've got a good reputation with the staff that works at the restaurant.

990
00:44:03.20 --> 00:44:06.20
It brings in more people like there's no doubt about it.

991
00:44:06.20 --> 00:44:09.20
The relationship just like any other business.

992
00:44:09.20 --> 00:44:16.20
The relationships that you build with the customers strengthens them strengthens that relationship and makes them want to come back for more right?

993
00:44:16.20 --> 00:44:18.20
That's the way it works.

994
00:44:18.20 --> 00:44:26.20
And so for them to say to you, hey man, hey, you know you're a good cook. We get that. We need a little bit more. We want a little bit more.

995
00:44:26.20 --> 00:44:27.20
Chef.

996
00:44:27.20 --> 00:44:30.20
We need somebody that has, yeah chef.

997
00:44:30.20 --> 00:44:32.20
You're good chef.

998
00:44:32.20 --> 00:44:34.20
Yeah, yeah, sorry. You're a good chef.

999
00:44:34.20 --> 00:44:39.20
Well actually, what I think I might have actually purposely said that.

1000
00:44:39.20 --> 00:44:43.20
Like hey, you're doing a good job in the kitchen as a cook.

1001
00:44:43.20 --> 00:44:49.20
We don't need someone that's just cooking the food. We need a chef with a reputation with a personality, right?

1002
00:44:49.20 --> 00:44:51.20
There's a difference there, right?

1003
00:44:51.20 --> 00:44:53.20
So it was called out for a reason.

1004
00:44:53.20 --> 00:44:54.20
Gotcha.

1005
00:44:54.20 --> 00:44:58.20
He's happy and you can see like kitchen dog.

1006
00:44:58.20 --> 00:44:59.20
Yeah, he's proud of that, right?

1007
00:44:59.20 --> 00:45:01.20
And I get that man.

1008
00:45:01.20 --> 00:45:02.20
I get that.

1009
00:45:02.20 --> 00:45:04.20
I get that. Like you're one of the boys.

1010
00:45:04.20 --> 00:45:06.20
You're back in the grind.

1011
00:45:06.20 --> 00:45:08.20
Well let me ask you this.

1012
00:45:08.20 --> 00:45:10.20
Or let me make this statement.

1013
00:45:10.20 --> 00:45:12.20
Guess what you have to do is a seal.

1014
00:45:12.20 --> 00:45:14.20
As a seal leader, guess what you have to do?

1015
00:45:14.20 --> 00:45:16.20
You have to build relationships.

1016
00:45:16.20 --> 00:45:19.20
You have to make your commanding officer trust you.

1017
00:45:19.20 --> 00:45:21.20
You have to build relationships with the army.

1018
00:45:21.20 --> 00:45:23.20
You have to build relationships through the Marine Corps.

1019
00:45:23.20 --> 00:45:25.20
You have to in order to do that.

1020
00:45:25.20 --> 00:45:28.20
You have to like raise your, you have to call a little bit of attention to yourself

1021
00:45:28.20 --> 00:45:32.20
and raise your hand and say, hey, this is who I am.

1022
00:45:32.20 --> 00:45:34.20
You have to take you, this is who I am.

1023
00:45:34.20 --> 00:45:38.20
You have to actually have to step into the spotlight a little bit

1024
00:45:38.20 --> 00:45:41.20
so that you can let people know who you are because if people don't know who you are,

1025
00:45:41.20 --> 00:45:44.20
how do you have a relationship with him and if you don't have a relationship with people

1026
00:45:44.20 --> 00:45:46.20
how can they trust you?

1027
00:45:46.20 --> 00:45:50.20
So, so that's part of it.

1028
00:45:50.20 --> 00:45:52.20
Right. That's part of what they're asking you to do.

1029
00:45:52.20 --> 00:45:58.20
Now, in all seriousness, if you really don't want to do it,

1030
00:45:58.20 --> 00:46:02.20
well then you can keep being the guy that's in the back and guess what?

1031
00:46:02.20 --> 00:46:06.20
You're going to be mad in six months when some other chef gets hired

1032
00:46:06.20 --> 00:46:09.20
for a different chef than all of a sudden he's out making friends with everyone.

1033
00:46:09.20 --> 00:46:12.20
He gets promoted and why do you get promoted?

1034
00:46:12.20 --> 00:46:14.20
Well, look at what the guy's doing.

1035
00:46:14.20 --> 00:46:19.20
But he's not as good as, he's not as good as a cook as I am.

1036
00:46:19.20 --> 00:46:21.20
Guess what? They don't really care.

1037
00:46:21.20 --> 00:46:25.20
Being making the food is only part of what they want you to do.

1038
00:46:25.20 --> 00:46:31.20
Just like being a seal, doing the doing missions is only part of what you need to do to do the mission.

1039
00:46:31.20 --> 00:46:34.20
You can't just be tactically sound. You've got to have the relationship built

1040
00:46:34.20 --> 00:46:38.20
so you can work in the battle space that's owned by a conventional commander.

1041
00:46:38.20 --> 00:46:41.20
You've got to have the relationship that you can get your missions approved

1042
00:46:41.20 --> 00:46:44.20
up the chain of command on the special operation side.

1043
00:46:44.20 --> 00:46:46.20
How do you do that? You build.

1044
00:46:46.20 --> 00:46:50.20
You go out. You talk to people. You get out of your comfort zone.

1045
00:46:50.20 --> 00:46:57.20
So weird thing, you know, I'm kind of anti-social, right?

1046
00:46:57.20 --> 00:47:03.20
Like, if you don't know me, we're not going to have a conversation.

1047
00:47:03.20 --> 00:47:08.20
You know, like, we're not having a conversation.

1048
00:47:08.20 --> 00:47:11.20
I'm not walking up and talking to you. If I don't know you, I'm not walking up and saying,

1049
00:47:11.20 --> 00:47:14.20
hi to you. It's not happening. It's not my personality.

1050
00:47:14.20 --> 00:47:18.20
If you say hi to me, I'll say hi. I'm not disrespectful.

1051
00:47:18.20 --> 00:47:23.20
I'm not rude, but I'm not looking to have a bunch of conversations with people.

1052
00:47:23.20 --> 00:47:26.20
And so that's known to me.

1053
00:47:26.20 --> 00:47:32.20
But that's not okay for the business side of my life, which is, hey, I got to talk to people.

1054
00:47:32.20 --> 00:47:34.20
I got to talk to people. I got to build relationships.

1055
00:47:34.20 --> 00:47:37.20
I got to had to know my commanding officer.

1056
00:47:37.20 --> 00:47:42.20
Had to know the commenter. Had to know the conventional

1057
00:47:42.20 --> 00:47:44.20
Battalion commander. Had to know the brigade commander.

1058
00:47:44.20 --> 00:47:48.20
Had to build relationships. Could I just talk about

1059
00:47:48.20 --> 00:47:52.20
war with the brigade commander?

1060
00:47:52.20 --> 00:47:56.20
Well, I could, but what's more powerful that I talk about war.

1061
00:47:56.20 --> 00:48:00.20
And I talk about where I'm from or where he's from or what, you know,

1062
00:48:00.20 --> 00:48:03.20
other things? Yes, because I want to build a relationship. Why?

1063
00:48:03.20 --> 00:48:05.20
Because I'm trying to build trust. Why?

1064
00:48:05.20 --> 00:48:08.20
Because I wanted to allow me to go out there and do things in his

1065
00:48:08.20 --> 00:48:10.20
battle space.

1066
00:48:10.20 --> 00:48:15.20
So that's what they're asking me. They're asking you to step out of your comfort zone.

1067
00:48:15.20 --> 00:48:18.20
It doesn't need to become your primary focus. No.

1068
00:48:18.20 --> 00:48:20.20
Should you try and step out of the comfort zone?

1069
00:48:20.20 --> 00:48:23.20
If you want to grow, if you want to have more opportunity,

1070
00:48:23.20 --> 00:48:25.20
I would give it a try.

1071
00:48:25.20 --> 00:48:27.20
I would give it a try.

1072
00:48:27.20 --> 00:48:33.20
If not, you know, like I said, if you hate it, and you feel like you're not being true to your true self,

1073
00:48:33.20 --> 00:48:38.20
that's okay. Maybe your true self is meant to be the one that's back, not getting promoted.

1074
00:48:38.20 --> 00:48:39.20
Yeah.

1075
00:48:39.20 --> 00:48:41.20
They need somebody to do that.

1076
00:48:41.20 --> 00:48:44.20
If it's not you, it might be somebody else.

1077
00:48:44.20 --> 00:48:45.20
Yeah.

1078
00:48:45.20 --> 00:48:48.20
So another one of those tough questions where people, you know, hit me with like,

1079
00:48:48.20 --> 00:48:51.20
should I just be, should be loyal to myself.

1080
00:48:51.20 --> 00:48:54.20
Because the obvious, like,

1081
00:48:54.20 --> 00:48:58.20
I think the answer that everyone wants to hear is like, yeah, dude, most important thing is you've got to be loyal to yourself.

1082
00:48:58.20 --> 00:48:59.20
That's the most important thing.

1083
00:48:59.20 --> 00:49:00.20
Yeah.

1084
00:49:00.20 --> 00:49:00.20
Okay.

1085
00:49:00.20 --> 00:49:03.20
If that's what your priority is, then that's the most important thing.

1086
00:49:03.20 --> 00:49:05.20
But guess what?

1087
00:49:05.20 --> 00:49:10.20
Who does a who can take care of the other kitchen dogs that respect you so much?

1088
00:49:10.20 --> 00:49:13.20
Who can take a better care of them than you can?

1089
00:49:13.20 --> 00:49:17.20
Because if you get promoted, if you don't get promoted and and

1090
00:49:17.20 --> 00:49:22.20
Johnny glamour boy gets promoted, because he likes to go out and

1091
00:49:22.20 --> 00:49:25.20
push moves to the clients and now he gets promoted and yours.

1092
00:49:25.20 --> 00:49:30.20
And now who's going to take care of the kitchen dogs on his, on his time, right?

1093
00:49:30.20 --> 00:49:31.20
Not him.

1094
00:49:31.20 --> 00:49:32.20
He doesn't care.

1095
00:49:32.20 --> 00:49:35.20
He's got he got promoted, not for taking care of his guys.

1096
00:49:35.20 --> 00:49:38.20
You got promoted because he smooths the clients.

1097
00:49:38.20 --> 00:49:39.20
Yeah.

1098
00:49:39.20 --> 00:49:40.20
And play the game a little bit.

1099
00:49:40.20 --> 00:49:43.20
It's weird when you're explaining that and it's like,

1100
00:49:43.20 --> 00:49:45.20
it makes complete sense.

1101
00:49:45.20 --> 00:49:48.20
I'm thinking of it in terms of like being a, I don't know.

1102
00:49:48.20 --> 00:49:51.20
I guess it applies to any relationship you have.

1103
00:49:51.20 --> 00:49:53.20
Like let's say, okay, you have a wife, right?

1104
00:49:53.20 --> 00:49:55.20
You're buried, whatever.

1105
00:49:55.20 --> 00:50:01.20
And so your wife wants to go to hypothetically.

1106
00:50:01.20 --> 00:50:03.20
Wife wants to go to ananovermott.

1107
00:50:03.20 --> 00:50:05.20
You're like, I don't like vermott.

1108
00:50:05.20 --> 00:50:07.20
You know, go to vermott.

1109
00:50:07.20 --> 00:50:12.20
But you're wife say, hey, I want you to come because I like spending time with you and

1110
00:50:12.20 --> 00:50:13.20
all this stuff.

1111
00:50:13.20 --> 00:50:16.20
And as a husband, you're like, hey, I like spending time with you too.

1112
00:50:16.20 --> 00:50:20.20
Why can't we do something that I specifically like to do?

1113
00:50:20.20 --> 00:50:25.20
And it has to do so a lot of times with like maybe you're ice friends with the

1114
00:50:25.20 --> 00:50:26.20
inlaw.

1115
00:50:26.20 --> 00:50:29.20
So I don't want to hang with you, but I want to hang with them and the wife wants to hang with you

1116
00:50:29.20 --> 00:50:31.20
with the friends and all this stuff or whatever.

1117
00:50:31.20 --> 00:50:38.20
But a lot of the time, in my case, might have been me just sticking in my little comfort zone.

1118
00:50:38.20 --> 00:50:42.20
You know, like the people that I like to hang out with, there's like set stuff that I know they're

1119
00:50:42.20 --> 00:50:45.20
into and I know they like to talk about it and all this stuff.

1120
00:50:45.20 --> 00:50:52.20
And I'm essentially rejecting being open to new or other stuff.

1121
00:50:52.20 --> 00:50:55.20
You know, that's kind of like a situation.

1122
00:50:55.20 --> 00:51:01.20
But in a way, I'm kind of doing what this, what this guy's implying where it's like,

1123
00:51:01.20 --> 00:51:05.20
I'm going to say to myself, my interest and all this stuff, I love my wife 100%.

1124
00:51:05.20 --> 00:51:06.20
That has nothing to do with it.

1125
00:51:06.20 --> 00:51:09.20
Vermont has nothing to do with me and my wife, you know.

1126
00:51:09.20 --> 00:51:14.20
But why shouldn't I step outside of my comfort zone?

1127
00:51:14.20 --> 00:51:18.20
And, you know, try to accommodate her wishes in this way.

1128
00:51:18.20 --> 00:51:20.20
It's not a maker breaker relationship enough like that.

1129
00:51:20.20 --> 00:51:28.20
But if I do that, if I just exercise the ability to be open, I become more valuable of a husband,

1130
00:51:28.20 --> 00:51:32.20
more valuable, I offer more value in the relationship and as a person.

1131
00:51:32.20 --> 00:51:37.20
So, same exact thing when you're explaining this, when this guy's explaining where he's

1132
00:51:37.20 --> 00:51:43.20
awesome in the as a chef in the back, doing the, you know, doing his deal, doing what he does best.

1133
00:51:43.20 --> 00:51:47.20
So, but they, and this guy see it, he's gonna be very see it, obviously,

1134
00:51:47.20 --> 00:51:51.20
where they're like, hey, we want you to do this more stuff even because you're awesome in men.

1135
00:51:51.20 --> 00:51:54.20
Imagine if you had this, this more stuff, you know,

1136
00:51:54.20 --> 00:51:59.20
a valuable you would be as a XYZ, whatever the position is in this case is a chef.

1137
00:51:59.20 --> 00:52:06.20
And to reject that is essentially to say, you know what, I don't want to be more valuable as a chef.

1138
00:52:06.20 --> 00:52:09.20
Or I don't want to be more valuable as a husband.

1139
00:52:09.20 --> 00:52:13.20
I prefer to stick with my current value.

1140
00:52:13.20 --> 00:52:15.20
I don't want to upgrade.

1141
00:52:15.20 --> 00:52:16.20
There you go.

1142
00:52:16.20 --> 00:52:18.20
I refuse to upgrade.

1143
00:52:18.20 --> 00:52:19.20
Some stain.

1144
00:52:19.20 --> 00:52:21.20
True to myself.

1145
00:52:21.20 --> 00:52:22.20
Just saying.

1146
00:52:22.20 --> 00:52:23.20
Anyway, next question.

1147
00:52:23.20 --> 00:52:27.20
I mean, can you cross the line and get to a point where you make yourself sick?

1148
00:52:27.20 --> 00:52:29.20
Because you've done, yeah, then you've gone too far.

1149
00:52:29.20 --> 00:52:34.20
That's, you know, like, I got me a leadership, like, yeah, if you become just a,

1150
00:52:34.20 --> 00:52:38.20
disgusting, sick event, then that's what?

1151
00:52:38.20 --> 00:52:39.20
That's not good.

1152
00:52:39.20 --> 00:52:40.20
Yeah.

1153
00:52:40.20 --> 00:52:41.20
So I'm not talking about that.

1154
00:52:41.20 --> 00:52:42.20
Yeah.

1155
00:52:42.20 --> 00:52:45.20
I'm not talking about leaving your values and abandoning your values.

1156
00:52:45.20 --> 00:52:46.20
That's not what I'm talking about.

1157
00:52:46.20 --> 00:52:47.20
Right.

1158
00:52:47.20 --> 00:52:48.20
Talking about playing the game a little bit.

1159
00:52:48.20 --> 00:52:49.20
There's a big difference.

1160
00:52:49.20 --> 00:52:50.20
Step up to the comfort zone.

1161
00:52:50.20 --> 00:52:51.20
Yeah.

1162
00:52:51.20 --> 00:52:52.20
Play the game a little bit.

1163
00:52:52.20 --> 00:52:54.20
At the very least, do it with the open mind.

1164
00:52:54.20 --> 00:52:55.20
See, I like it.

1165
00:52:55.20 --> 00:52:57.20
What if you were like, you got real good at that?

1166
00:52:57.20 --> 00:53:02.20
You know, like public speaking, for example, where I'm no exception.

1167
00:53:02.20 --> 00:53:05.20
A lot of people don't like public speaking.

1168
00:53:05.20 --> 00:53:08.20
Even though they might have a lot to say or whatever, you know, like some people like

1169
00:53:08.20 --> 00:53:11.20
they're smart, but I don't want to get up on state and nothing like that.

1170
00:53:11.20 --> 00:53:12.20
That's dumb.

1171
00:53:12.20 --> 00:53:13.20
I'm not a star.

1172
00:53:13.20 --> 00:53:16.20
I don't want to limelight on me and all this stuff.

1173
00:53:16.20 --> 00:53:20.20
They do one time and they offer like just so much value doing it.

1174
00:53:20.20 --> 00:53:21.20
And then they get used to it.

1175
00:53:21.20 --> 00:53:23.20
Then all of a sudden they kind of like it.

1176
00:53:23.20 --> 00:53:25.20
You know, it could be one of those deals.

1177
00:53:25.20 --> 00:53:26.20
Could be.

1178
00:53:26.20 --> 00:53:27.20
You never know.

1179
00:53:27.20 --> 00:53:29.20
So you try it.

1180
00:53:29.20 --> 00:53:31.20
Next question.

1181
00:53:31.20 --> 00:53:34.20
Two of my bosses have told me I don't like Jocco.

1182
00:53:34.20 --> 00:53:35.20
Interesting.

1183
00:53:35.20 --> 00:53:36.20
Interesting.

1184
00:53:36.20 --> 00:53:38.20
Got that.

1185
00:53:38.20 --> 00:53:43.20
Without giving any valid reasons, their ego is in the way.

1186
00:53:43.20 --> 00:53:47.20
How do I flank them to help them see the path?

1187
00:53:47.20 --> 00:53:53.20
My belief is that they're afraid of the truth and they're afraid of the truth.

1188
00:53:53.20 --> 00:53:55.20
They see an extreme ownership.

1189
00:53:55.20 --> 00:53:56.20
Okay.

1190
00:53:56.20 --> 00:53:59.20
So, yeah, I mean clearly, you go could be a problem here as a leader.

1191
00:53:59.20 --> 00:54:03.20
You know, who wants to constantly be compared to some other leader?

1192
00:54:03.20 --> 00:54:04.20
Right.

1193
00:54:04.20 --> 00:54:08.20
You know, if you were teaching a Jocco, the way that the way that Dean teaches this, you know,

1194
00:54:08.20 --> 00:54:11.20
that would make you mad after all.

1195
00:54:11.20 --> 00:54:13.20
So that could be part of the problem.

1196
00:54:13.20 --> 00:54:14.20
Oh, that's definitely.

1197
00:54:14.20 --> 00:54:17.20
That's that's a way up there on the list of possible things.

1198
00:54:17.20 --> 00:54:19.20
Could be the military flavor, right?

1199
00:54:19.20 --> 00:54:21.20
Some people don't like the military flavor thing.

1200
00:54:21.20 --> 00:54:23.20
So that's that's okay.

1201
00:54:23.20 --> 00:54:24.20
It's.

1202
00:54:24.20 --> 00:54:25.20
It's.

1203
00:54:25.20 --> 00:54:26.20
It's.

1204
00:54:26.20 --> 00:54:27.20
Can turn some people off.

1205
00:54:27.20 --> 00:54:28.20
They don't want to hear about it.

1206
00:54:28.20 --> 00:54:29.20
That's fine.

1207
00:54:29.20 --> 00:54:31.20
The reality is.

1208
00:54:31.20 --> 00:54:32.20
It's.

1209
00:54:32.20 --> 00:54:33.20
It's.

1210
00:54:33.20 --> 00:54:35.20
But here's the reality of the situation.

1211
00:54:35.20 --> 00:54:36.20
Okay.

1212
00:54:36.20 --> 00:54:44.20
What is there to not like about the things that I talk about, right?

1213
00:54:44.20 --> 00:54:46.20
So let's say, you know what, I don't like people taking ownership.

1214
00:54:46.20 --> 00:54:49.20
I want everyone to make excuses and play each other, right?

1215
00:54:49.20 --> 00:54:51.20
It doesn't even make sense.

1216
00:54:51.20 --> 00:54:54.20
You know, instead of, you know, I don't want to hear about this cover move.

1217
00:54:54.20 --> 00:54:56.20
I want everyone to ignore each other and get more.

1218
00:54:56.20 --> 00:54:57.20
You're about themselves, right?

1219
00:54:57.20 --> 00:55:00.20
Like that that that makes no sense whatsoever.

1220
00:55:00.20 --> 00:55:04.20
You know, if, if keeping things simple, I don't want to, hey, look, I don't want to keep things simple.

1221
00:55:04.20 --> 00:55:05.20
I want everything to be so complicated.

1222
00:55:05.20 --> 00:55:07.20
But no one knows what's going on, right?

1223
00:55:07.20 --> 00:55:11.20
Like, look, these things that they make note, there's no human being.

1224
00:55:11.20 --> 00:55:13.20
No one in a leadership position.

1225
00:55:13.20 --> 00:55:20.20
That would want everyone or that would that would go against what these simple principles.

1226
00:55:20.20 --> 00:55:23.20
So.

1227
00:55:23.20 --> 00:55:25.20
How do you fix it then, right?

1228
00:55:25.20 --> 00:55:27.20
What's the problem?

1229
00:55:27.20 --> 00:55:30.20
Well, one, here's a couple, and actually this was a Twitter thing.

1230
00:55:30.20 --> 00:55:35.20
And a bunch of people gave great responses on Twitter after I kind of highlighted it.

1231
00:55:35.20 --> 00:55:41.20
One, one of them, and my, my actual responses like, hey, just don't, you know, stop using my name.

1232
00:55:41.20 --> 00:55:45.20
You know, stop saying, well, joculous it because you can imagine how I'm knowing that much.

1233
00:55:45.20 --> 00:55:48.20
Oh, well, joculous in, you know, when you're in a leadership position, you know, it's like.

1234
00:55:48.20 --> 00:55:50.20
That's going to really great on somebody.

1235
00:55:50.20 --> 00:55:52.20
So, so, so throw that out the window.

1236
00:55:52.20 --> 00:55:58.20
Don't pit it as me, jocco against what your boss is saying, no, don't do that.

1237
00:55:58.20 --> 00:56:01.20
You've set up an adversarial relationship with them.

1238
00:56:01.20 --> 00:56:03.20
And you've set up an adversarial relationship with me.

1239
00:56:03.20 --> 00:56:05.20
And I've never even met these people before.

1240
00:56:05.20 --> 00:56:08.20
I don't even know who they are even know what business they're in.

1241
00:56:08.20 --> 00:56:12.20
But what you've done by constantly harping on it is you've pissed them off.

1242
00:56:12.20 --> 00:56:14.20
And now they're saying, dude, quit talking about jocco.

1243
00:56:14.20 --> 00:56:21.20
We don't care because also the way that he's, just the way he's being offensive in approaching these things.

1244
00:56:21.20 --> 00:56:24.20
And watching these things means that he has a little more listening and growing to do.

1245
00:56:24.20 --> 00:56:29.20
Because if you really want to approach your boss or, you know, he asked about flanking his boss.

1246
00:56:29.20 --> 00:56:32.20
Well, the way you flank someone isn't going, hey, the way jocco is such you should do this.

1247
00:56:32.20 --> 00:56:35.20
Like, no, that's not good.

1248
00:56:35.20 --> 00:56:41.20
So let the principles work on another, another person pointed out, you know,

1249
00:56:41.20 --> 00:56:46.20
Hey, don't, hey, stop trying to impose your things on them.

1250
00:56:46.20 --> 00:56:48.20
Like, just take extreme ownership.

1251
00:56:48.20 --> 00:56:52.20
That's how you step up and start leading. You do your thing. You perform well.

1252
00:56:52.20 --> 00:56:56.20
Quit talking, quit trying to force these things down people's throat and give them space.

1253
00:56:56.20 --> 00:56:57.20
Give them room.

1254
00:56:57.20 --> 00:57:02.20
And then they'll recognize that you're doing a good job.

1255
00:57:02.20 --> 00:57:06.20
If you label it with something that you know, they don't like.

1256
00:57:06.20 --> 00:57:10.20
Well, then they're not going to like it. No matter what you do, no matter what you do.

1257
00:57:10.20 --> 00:57:12.20
That's going to be problematic.

1258
00:57:12.20 --> 00:57:17.20
Don't beludge them with with, well, you know, I, this is blah, blah, blah.

1259
00:57:17.20 --> 00:57:19.20
No, don't do that.

1260
00:57:19.20 --> 00:57:22.20
Take, let, but you're ego in check. How's that sound?

1261
00:57:22.20 --> 00:57:24.20
Put your ego in check a little bit.

1262
00:57:24.20 --> 00:57:28.20
Make the ideas that you're talking about, their ideas.

1263
00:57:28.20 --> 00:57:30.20
Get them to talk about ownership.

1264
00:57:30.20 --> 00:57:33.20
You know, get them, maybe they call it something else.

1265
00:57:33.20 --> 00:57:34.20
Other than extreme ownership.

1266
00:57:34.20 --> 00:57:37.20
Maybe they call it, you know, personal accountability.

1267
00:57:37.20 --> 00:57:40.20
Okay, awesome. That's a great, yeah. I really like that.

1268
00:57:40.20 --> 00:57:42.20
I really like what you've come up with, boss. I'm in with that.

1269
00:57:42.20 --> 00:57:44.20
Oh, well, now they're in the game.

1270
00:57:44.20 --> 00:57:47.20
And they don't realize that you're talking about the same thing.

1271
00:57:47.20 --> 00:57:48.20
That's fine.

1272
00:57:48.20 --> 00:57:49.20
Don't, they don't ever have to realize that.

1273
00:57:49.20 --> 00:57:52.20
They don't ever have to realize that.

1274
00:57:52.20 --> 00:57:55.20
So, I mean, there's some people, there's some people that don't like,

1275
00:57:55.20 --> 00:57:58.20
even in the teams, there's people that like, they didn't like me.

1276
00:57:58.20 --> 00:58:02.20
Didn't matter, didn't matter where what the, the principle was,

1277
00:58:02.20 --> 00:58:04.20
didn't make, oh, that's the law.

1278
00:58:04.20 --> 00:58:06.20
It's like, no.

1279
00:58:06.20 --> 00:58:11.20
Like, hey, just, just don't, don't attach my name to it.

1280
00:58:11.20 --> 00:58:14.20
Yeah. And go and do, be a good leader. How's that?

1281
00:58:14.20 --> 00:58:16.20
So, those are some things.

1282
00:58:16.20 --> 00:58:20.20
I think if you live, live the principles, act on the principles,

1283
00:58:20.20 --> 00:58:23.20
no one's going to be mad at you for taking ownership

1284
00:58:23.20 --> 00:58:25.20
and responsibility of what you're doing.

1285
00:58:25.20 --> 00:58:27.20
Unless you say, oh, you look how I took ownership of that.

1286
00:58:27.20 --> 00:58:30.20
Well, then you might paint yourself into a corner with it.

1287
00:58:30.20 --> 00:58:31.20
They weren't stupid.

1288
00:58:31.20 --> 00:58:34.20
Or they end up not accepting what you're doing.

1289
00:58:34.20 --> 00:58:35.20
Yeah.

1290
00:58:35.20 --> 00:58:37.20
And they'll get mad at you for stepping on their toes, of course.

1291
00:58:37.20 --> 00:58:40.20
And it is also, as you do this, as you take ownership,

1292
00:58:40.20 --> 00:58:42.20
don't rub their noses in it.

1293
00:58:42.20 --> 00:58:44.20
You give them credit. How hard is that?

1294
00:58:44.20 --> 00:58:46.20
You know, you've come up with a pro solution to problem,

1295
00:58:46.20 --> 00:58:48.20
say, hey, no, actually, I got this idea from something like,

1296
00:58:48.20 --> 00:58:49.20
oh, you do it.

1297
00:58:49.20 --> 00:58:50.20
Really?

1298
00:58:50.20 --> 00:58:51.20
Right?

1299
00:58:51.20 --> 00:58:53.20
That's how you, that's how you flank them.

1300
00:58:53.20 --> 00:58:55.20
Hey, it took ownership of this problem.

1301
00:58:55.20 --> 00:58:56.20
Oh, really?

1302
00:58:56.20 --> 00:58:57.20
Oh, you took all the, you're a ghost streamer.

1303
00:58:57.20 --> 00:59:11.20
You know, I don't want to say that.

1304
00:59:11.20 --> 00:59:13.20
Don't say that.

1305
00:59:13.20 --> 00:59:15.20
You know, it's a K-Boss.

1306
00:59:15.20 --> 00:59:17.20
I wanted to make sure this got done correctly.

1307
00:59:17.20 --> 00:59:19.20
I was watching the way you did.

1308
00:59:19.20 --> 00:59:20.20
Dobba, bo, bo, bo, bo.

1309
00:59:20.20 --> 00:59:21.20
You go from there.

1310
00:59:21.20 --> 00:59:22.20
Yeah.

1311
00:59:22.20 --> 00:59:23.20
Give them the idea.

1312
00:59:23.20 --> 00:59:25.20
You know, makes sense.

1313
00:59:25.20 --> 00:59:29.20
is multiple repetitions of what you guys say.

1314
00:59:29.20 --> 00:59:30.20
Yeah, yeah.

1315
00:59:30.20 --> 00:59:34.52
And didn't pick up the vibe, which is like, hey, I'm dealing with someone

1316
00:59:34.52 --> 00:59:37.76
with a big ego and they're not going to take well to me talking about this

1317
00:59:37.76 --> 00:59:39.36
other guys leadership style.

1318
00:59:39.36 --> 00:59:41.76
Do you, you don't want to be compared to some other leader if you're in

1319
00:59:41.76 --> 00:59:42.60
leadership position?

1320
00:59:42.60 --> 00:59:43.60
Yeah.

1321
00:59:43.60 --> 00:59:47.20
And I'm also, this kind of the same thing, but a little bit different.

1322
00:59:47.20 --> 00:59:52.64
The, that thinking about that type of scenario, man, that's the worst.

1323
00:59:52.64 --> 00:59:56.12
That's like as a boss, I would think that that'd be really bad.

1324
00:59:56.12 --> 00:59:58.56
Because okay, so here's his situation.

1325
00:59:58.56 --> 01:00:01.28
So I make videos sometimes.

1326
01:00:01.28 --> 01:00:02.28
Right.

1327
01:00:02.28 --> 01:00:06.24
And so let's say I am, and actually this is an actual thing that actually

1328
01:00:06.24 --> 01:00:10.88
happened where, okay, so I'm in this video for this, we'll say client.

1329
01:00:10.88 --> 01:00:14.48
And, classic, okay, you know, they look at it and it's typical, you know, they'll have

1330
01:00:14.48 --> 01:00:18.72
some input, maybe some information they want to add or take or change or whatever.

1331
01:00:18.72 --> 01:00:24.44
And then this guy said, oh yeah, I'm not sure about this part.

1332
01:00:24.44 --> 01:00:32.44
I showed it to my wife and she said, you know, XYZ and XYZ and I'm thinking, okay, I get it,

1333
01:00:32.44 --> 01:00:35.52
like okay, you showed it to people that understand, but I was like, wait, wait, wait.

1334
01:00:35.52 --> 01:00:40.08
So this is a video I made for you and your deal, you know, kind of thing.

1335
01:00:40.08 --> 01:00:43.08
And you went and showed your wife and then now she has some kind of input.

1336
01:00:43.08 --> 01:00:45.88
She's not part of this deal, you know?

1337
01:00:45.88 --> 01:00:49.68
And now you're like sighting your wife's critique and like all this stuff.

1338
01:00:49.68 --> 01:00:53.24
And it does make sense by the way, as far as what we've discussed and all this stuff, right?

1339
01:00:53.24 --> 01:00:56.76
So the wife is kind of now I kind of have this kind of disdain for the wife.

1340
01:00:56.76 --> 01:00:58.52
I don't know the wife at all, by the way.

1341
01:00:58.52 --> 01:01:00.88
So I'm like, I'm just not feeling the wife anymore.

1342
01:01:00.88 --> 01:01:01.88
You go got the way.

1343
01:01:01.88 --> 01:01:05.68
You know, you're a little bit in it and it's natural is what I'm saying where it's kind

1344
01:01:05.68 --> 01:01:09.08
of like, I thought we were doing this video kind of together and I'll do this for you

1345
01:01:09.08 --> 01:01:12.16
and you give me the input and we're not, you involved your wife in it who threw the whole

1346
01:01:12.16 --> 01:01:13.96
thing off because she's not even part of this little thing.

1347
01:01:13.96 --> 01:01:14.96
Right.

1348
01:01:14.96 --> 01:01:16.56
It's really hard to put your ego in check.

1349
01:01:16.56 --> 01:01:20.76
It's really hard to put your ego in check and actually listen to what the critique points

1350
01:01:20.76 --> 01:01:21.76
are.

1351
01:01:21.76 --> 01:01:24.20
It's hard for anyone to do that.

1352
01:01:24.20 --> 01:01:29.72
And so when it happens, you have to go, okay, that's my ego and you need to put it

1353
01:01:29.72 --> 01:01:30.72
aside.

1354
01:01:30.72 --> 01:01:31.72
Yeah.

1355
01:01:31.72 --> 01:01:33.56
So consider this situation.

1356
01:01:33.56 --> 01:01:38.64
If the guy would have just said, don't say I showed it to my wife and she said this.

1357
01:01:38.64 --> 01:01:42.80
Don't say if he would have said, well, I was thinking about this, which is what the wife

1358
01:01:42.80 --> 01:01:44.28
said, you know, in that whatever.

1359
01:01:44.28 --> 01:01:48.76
I was thinking about this, whether it would have got delivered way better, way easier,

1360
01:01:48.76 --> 01:01:53.32
same thing with your situation if someone's saying, I don't know, let's say, for example,

1361
01:01:53.32 --> 01:01:56.04
it's a fireman, it's a fireman.

1362
01:01:56.04 --> 01:01:59.56
And you know, the boss is saying, hey, we should do this and do that and then this guy

1363
01:01:59.56 --> 01:02:03.60
just, I'll be saying, well, Jocco said, boss is like, who the hell is Jocco?

1364
01:02:03.60 --> 01:02:06.04
I don't remember hiring Jocco, who is this guy?

1365
01:02:06.04 --> 01:02:10.40
And what's he talking about cool, but Jocco has no saying this department.

1366
01:02:10.40 --> 01:02:14.16
It's me and it's you, it's the team, you know, the team that we've worked with kind of

1367
01:02:14.16 --> 01:02:16.000
thing and that's kind of the feeling.

1368
01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:17.32
So yeah, I'm in.

1369
01:02:17.32 --> 01:02:18.32
Don't say Jocco.

1370
01:02:18.32 --> 01:02:21.80
Yeah, I don't need to credit.

1371
01:02:21.80 --> 01:02:22.80
Not all.

1372
01:02:22.80 --> 01:02:25.12
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1373
01:02:25.12 --> 01:02:29.92
Next question, Jocco, please explain how working harder for an incompetent superior

1374
01:02:29.92 --> 01:02:31.56
helps oneself.

1375
01:02:31.56 --> 01:02:35.92
I feel like screw them in whatever lightning bolt of luck they were struck by it again in

1376
01:02:35.92 --> 01:02:36.92
their position.

1377
01:02:36.92 --> 01:02:40.72
That kind of like screw them in the horse they rode in.

1378
01:02:40.72 --> 01:02:41.72
Yeah, that is.

1379
01:02:41.72 --> 01:02:42.96
No, he's saying screw them in.

1380
01:02:42.96 --> 01:02:45.76
They're, they're in their position of superior because they got lucky.

1381
01:02:45.76 --> 01:02:46.76
Yeah, yeah, I didn't get lucky.

1382
01:02:46.76 --> 01:02:47.76
Well, that's true.

1383
01:02:47.76 --> 01:02:48.76
Yeah.

1384
01:02:48.76 --> 01:02:51.92
And, you know, here's the answer that is like, okay, so what do you can do then?

1385
01:02:51.92 --> 01:02:52.92
Yeah.

1386
01:02:52.92 --> 01:02:54.16
Okay, what do you can do then?

1387
01:02:54.16 --> 01:02:59.36
You're going to sit around and wait for your own bolt of lightning of luck to hit you.

1388
01:02:59.36 --> 01:03:01.56
Is that what you're going to do?

1389
01:03:01.56 --> 01:03:02.56
I don't recommend that.

1390
01:03:02.56 --> 01:03:06.88
Instead, I recommend that you step up and yes, you do work harder.

1391
01:03:06.88 --> 01:03:11.16
And you do the best possible job that you can do and you take some pride in what you're

1392
01:03:11.16 --> 01:03:13.12
doing and how you're doing it.

1393
01:03:13.12 --> 01:03:18.72
And you do it better than they could not to rub their nose into it, not to prove that you

1394
01:03:18.72 --> 01:03:23.20
can do a better, but out of professionalism.

1395
01:03:23.20 --> 01:03:24.20
That's why you do it.

1396
01:03:24.20 --> 01:03:30.72
Now, one outcome that can come from that is they get credit for your work and that makes

1397
01:03:30.72 --> 01:03:31.72
you all mad.

1398
01:03:31.72 --> 01:03:35.36
No, that's actually good because if they get credit for your work, that's what works going

1399
01:03:35.36 --> 01:03:37.80
well, they're going to get promoted.

1400
01:03:37.80 --> 01:03:39.80
And they get the recognition.

1401
01:03:39.80 --> 01:03:43.48
Okay, that's fine.

1402
01:03:43.48 --> 01:03:49.76
But they know where the actual credit goes, even if they don't give it to you, even if

1403
01:03:49.76 --> 01:03:54.60
they don't give it to you, they know it, even if they have a person who doesn't even realize

1404
01:03:54.60 --> 01:03:58.76
that you're like, oh, wow, I did all that work and he's taken all the credit for.

1405
01:03:58.76 --> 01:04:01.72
They don't even know that I made this happen or he doesn't even know that he's that I made

1406
01:04:01.72 --> 01:04:02.72
this happen.

1407
01:04:02.72 --> 01:04:06.16
No, they know.

1408
01:04:06.16 --> 01:04:12.48
So as long as you can keep your ego in check and you can let them have the credit eventually,

1409
01:04:12.48 --> 01:04:13.48
they get promoted.

1410
01:04:13.48 --> 01:04:14.48
The team's doing well.

1411
01:04:14.48 --> 01:04:15.48
You'll look good.

1412
01:04:15.48 --> 01:04:16.48
You'll get promoted.

1413
01:04:16.48 --> 01:04:18.40
Your life is easy.

1414
01:04:18.40 --> 01:04:19.96
Your gaining experience.

1415
01:04:19.96 --> 01:04:20.96
You've got a good reputation.

1416
01:04:20.96 --> 01:04:24.72
Everything is going in your direction.

1417
01:04:24.72 --> 01:04:29.44
And by the way, when that incompetent person does get promoted, who do they usually recommend

1418
01:04:29.44 --> 01:04:30.44
that fills their spot?

1419
01:04:30.44 --> 01:04:32.24
You, because you're the one that got them promoted.

1420
01:04:32.24 --> 01:04:34.84
They're stoked on that.

1421
01:04:34.84 --> 01:04:37.20
Now you become a superstar.

1422
01:04:37.20 --> 01:04:38.20
That's great.

1423
01:04:38.20 --> 01:04:40.64
Eventually they're going to get found out by the way.

1424
01:04:40.64 --> 01:04:43.48
Someone incompetency can't be hidden forever.

1425
01:04:43.48 --> 01:04:45.84
And eventually someone says, wait a second, you didn't even know how to do this.

1426
01:04:45.84 --> 01:04:46.84
That was echo Charles.

1427
01:04:46.84 --> 01:04:48.88
That was doing this this whole time.

1428
01:04:48.88 --> 01:04:49.88
Yeah?

1429
01:04:49.88 --> 01:04:50.88
Okay.

1430
01:04:50.88 --> 01:04:51.68
Okay, well, we're going to promote echo.

1431
01:04:51.68 --> 01:04:53.000
You're out of here.

1432
01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.52
That'll happen.

1433
01:04:55.52 --> 01:05:00.68
And when that happens, when that incompetency gets found out, then you will get the recognition

1434
01:05:00.68 --> 01:05:03.28
you deserve, because people said, I don't know, that wasn't Jocco doing all this stuff.

1435
01:05:03.28 --> 01:05:04.28
This was echo.

1436
01:05:04.28 --> 01:05:05.28
There you go.

1437
01:05:05.28 --> 01:05:06.48
Oh, Jocco, you're done.

1438
01:05:06.48 --> 01:05:08.80
So that's something to happen.

1439
01:05:08.80 --> 01:05:12.96
Or another outcome that can happen is that they give you the credit that you're

1440
01:05:12.96 --> 01:05:14.64
due, which is great.

1441
01:05:14.64 --> 01:05:15.80
And you still get promoted.

1442
01:05:15.80 --> 01:05:19.04
And you may get promoted above them, which is fine, too.

1443
01:05:19.04 --> 01:05:24.40
And, or they might get promoted, which is fine, stop worrying about it.

1444
01:05:24.40 --> 01:05:28.52
So those two things, if you do a good job, eventually something good is going to come out

1445
01:05:28.52 --> 01:05:29.52
of it.

1446
01:05:29.52 --> 01:05:32.72
They get whether it's you both get promoted, whether it's they get promoted above you, whether

1447
01:05:32.72 --> 01:05:33.96
it's you get promoted above them.

1448
01:05:33.96 --> 01:05:34.96
It doesn't matter.

1449
01:05:34.96 --> 01:05:37.56
All those outcomes, or maybe it's just the team continues to do well.

1450
01:05:37.56 --> 01:05:40.32
And your job is stress free and you continue to perform.

1451
01:05:40.32 --> 01:05:45.44
And the division that you're in grows and you get a chance to promote, because everyone's

1452
01:05:45.44 --> 01:05:47.28
getting promoted, it's like, oh, good.

1453
01:05:47.28 --> 01:05:49.96
All good stuff.

1454
01:05:49.96 --> 01:05:53.08
Or you can be angry and you can be frustrated and you can blame your own bad luck and

1455
01:05:53.08 --> 01:05:56.84
you can not work hard and you can not do a good job and you can be recognized as a slacker

1456
01:05:56.84 --> 01:06:01.60
or you can get blamed by the incompetent boss when things do fall short.

1457
01:06:01.60 --> 01:06:03.96
Because that's what the incompetent boss does.

1458
01:06:03.96 --> 01:06:05.76
He doesn't step up and say, go ownership of it.

1459
01:06:05.76 --> 01:06:06.76
He says, no, you know what?

1460
01:06:06.76 --> 01:06:09.08
I would have done a better job, but Echo was slacking.

1461
01:06:09.08 --> 01:06:10.08
That's the problem.

1462
01:06:10.08 --> 01:06:13.24
Now Echo gets fired.

1463
01:06:13.24 --> 01:06:14.72
And guess what?

1464
01:06:14.72 --> 01:06:16.92
Someone, we hire someone else to come in and they start doing a good job.

1465
01:06:16.92 --> 01:06:20.36
The boss is still going to look good and still get promoted, just that you lost your

1466
01:06:20.36 --> 01:06:21.36
job.

1467
01:06:21.36 --> 01:06:22.96
And by the way, you lost your job with a bad reputation.

1468
01:06:22.96 --> 01:06:26.68
Now you can't even get a recommendation for a new job.

1469
01:06:26.68 --> 01:06:29.68
Where you lose?

1470
01:06:29.68 --> 01:06:31.56
That's what's going to happen.

1471
01:06:31.56 --> 01:06:33.68
So step up, do your best.

1472
01:06:33.68 --> 01:06:36.28
It'll pay off in the long run.

1473
01:06:36.28 --> 01:06:37.28
Yeah.

1474
01:06:37.28 --> 01:06:40.04
It's funny how like it's one of those things where if you can just flip the switch and

1475
01:06:40.04 --> 01:06:41.64
see that, just that one, you think?

1476
01:06:41.64 --> 01:06:46.92
And it's funny though, too, the way those questions are framed, you know, what they

1477
01:06:46.92 --> 01:06:50.72
want to hear is like, no, you know, what if you got an incompetent boss, you don't help

1478
01:06:50.72 --> 01:06:52.24
them out, you've got a bird.

1479
01:06:52.24 --> 01:06:53.24
Yeah.

1480
01:06:53.24 --> 01:06:54.24
That's what you do.

1481
01:06:54.24 --> 01:06:55.24
That's what people want to hear.

1482
01:06:55.24 --> 01:06:58.000
But it's the easy answer and it's not the smart answer.

1483
01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:01.000
And it's a short term answer, not a long term answer.

1484
01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:02.40
Make your boss look great.

1485
01:07:02.40 --> 01:07:03.64
How's that?

1486
01:07:03.64 --> 01:07:04.64
That's my goal.

1487
01:07:04.64 --> 01:07:06.28
I want to make my boss look great.

1488
01:07:06.28 --> 01:07:11.64
There was a little tell in the question too.

1489
01:07:11.64 --> 01:07:12.64
I'm no expert.

1490
01:07:12.64 --> 01:07:14.48
Obviously, but I'm like, both of luck.

1491
01:07:14.48 --> 01:07:15.48
Yeah.

1492
01:07:15.48 --> 01:07:16.56
So you know the whole deal.

1493
01:07:16.56 --> 01:07:19.76
And this is even, you can be a person who recognize this.

1494
01:07:19.76 --> 01:07:23.56
Like people who are bitter, I'm not saying the asker of this question is bad.

1495
01:07:23.56 --> 01:07:24.56
I'm not saying that.

1496
01:07:24.56 --> 01:07:27.52
I'm saying this is an external scenario.

1497
01:07:27.52 --> 01:07:32.000
But you know, if you get a bitter person who's just being in life, maybe not doing it

1498
01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:37.52
as well in life as they had, you know, had hoped or whatever, you'll probably realize

1499
01:07:37.52 --> 01:07:40.60
you'll probably encounter them from time to time.

1500
01:07:40.60 --> 01:07:41.60
No more.

1501
01:07:41.60 --> 01:07:45.40
Saying how the guy who is successful is lucky.

1502
01:07:45.40 --> 01:07:46.80
They're lucky.

1503
01:07:46.80 --> 01:07:50.12
They had a given to them, like all this, all this other stuff.

1504
01:07:50.12 --> 01:07:52.12
Me, I'm not lucky with whatever.

1505
01:07:52.12 --> 01:07:54.16
But it's always the successful guy.

1506
01:07:54.16 --> 01:07:55.16
It's lucky.

1507
01:07:55.16 --> 01:07:56.16
Always.

1508
01:07:56.16 --> 01:07:58.16
Yeah, they attribute other people's success to luck.

1509
01:07:58.16 --> 01:08:03.88
So they're lightning bolt of luck and screw them, you know, kind of thing.

1510
01:08:03.88 --> 01:08:04.88
Just that is indicative.

1511
01:08:04.88 --> 01:08:05.88
I'm not saying it is.

1512
01:08:05.88 --> 01:08:08.60
I'm not saying it is or isn't as far as this particular person.

1513
01:08:08.60 --> 01:08:10.88
But it tends to be like that.

1514
01:08:10.88 --> 01:08:12.36
And again, like that, just that switch.

1515
01:08:12.36 --> 01:08:16.44
If you can turn on the switch and just look at it, just like how you said, it's not intuitive.

1516
01:08:16.44 --> 01:08:17.44
I get it, man.

1517
01:08:17.44 --> 01:08:22.08
Because it's like, I was in that situation where like literally I was doing the work.

1518
01:08:22.08 --> 01:08:23.72
So many think about this.

1519
01:08:23.72 --> 01:08:26.16
You just said you're in this situation.

1520
01:08:26.16 --> 01:08:28.28
Almost everybody has been in this situation.

1521
01:08:28.28 --> 01:08:30.40
And here's the difference.

1522
01:08:30.40 --> 01:08:35.16
If you don't flip that switch and you're in this situation, your whole life goes down

1523
01:08:35.16 --> 01:08:36.16
in the other direction.

1524
01:08:36.16 --> 01:08:37.16
Yeah.

1525
01:08:37.16 --> 01:08:38.16
That's the real problem.

1526
01:08:38.16 --> 01:08:39.16
That's why you meet people.

1527
01:08:39.16 --> 01:08:41.20
You know, this is a thing I think about a lot.

1528
01:08:41.20 --> 01:08:45.36
You know how you know people in your life, their bad asses.

1529
01:08:45.36 --> 01:08:48.84
But they, but they're not going anywhere.

1530
01:08:48.84 --> 01:08:52.04
Like you look at it and you go, man, this kind of smarter than me.

1531
01:08:52.04 --> 01:08:57.92
And a better athlete than me and a better speaker than me.

1532
01:08:57.92 --> 01:08:59.36
But they're not going anywhere.

1533
01:08:59.36 --> 01:09:03.40
And you know why it's because at some point in their life instead of saying, oh, wow, that

1534
01:09:03.40 --> 01:09:04.56
guy's lucky.

1535
01:09:04.56 --> 01:09:06.56
That's what they do.

1536
01:09:06.56 --> 01:09:10.56
At some point in their life instead of saying, hey, that person worked to get in that

1537
01:09:10.56 --> 01:09:12.56
situation and I should do the same.

1538
01:09:12.56 --> 01:09:13.56
Is that a saying that?

1539
01:09:13.56 --> 01:09:15.28
They say, oh, that person got lucky.

1540
01:09:15.28 --> 01:09:16.28
Yeah.

1541
01:09:16.28 --> 01:09:17.28
That's why they're there.

1542
01:09:17.28 --> 01:09:18.28
And I'm down here.

1543
01:09:18.28 --> 01:09:19.28
Yeah.

1544
01:09:19.28 --> 01:09:20.28
You better make them.

1545
01:09:20.28 --> 01:09:21.28
Yeah, you can't make the upward climb.

1546
01:09:21.28 --> 01:09:25.12
If you don't say, you know what, hey, that person might be a little luck there.

1547
01:09:25.12 --> 01:09:27.32
But guess what, they're obviously working hard.

1548
01:09:27.32 --> 01:09:29.80
They're obviously doing something right because I'm down here and they're up there.

1549
01:09:29.80 --> 01:09:31.28
How do I get up there?

1550
01:09:31.28 --> 01:09:32.44
Yeah.

1551
01:09:32.44 --> 01:09:35.64
The answer to get up there is not by tearing them down.

1552
01:09:35.64 --> 01:09:38.20
The answer to get up there is by working hard.

1553
01:09:38.20 --> 01:09:39.60
Make them look good.

1554
01:09:39.60 --> 01:09:44.64
That line you said, so what?

1555
01:09:44.64 --> 01:09:46.28
And so what are you going to do about it?

1556
01:09:46.28 --> 01:09:47.28
Yeah, what are you going to do about it?

1557
01:09:47.28 --> 01:09:48.92
That's the switch right there.

1558
01:09:48.92 --> 01:09:50.96
Because I mean, you do with it with kids.

1559
01:09:50.96 --> 01:09:55.40
I've seen some young kids and, you know, same thing like, oh, this is what it is or this

1560
01:09:55.40 --> 01:09:59.40
happened or whatever spilled milk out of no whatever.

1561
01:09:59.40 --> 01:10:00.60
And, you know, the kids crying.

1562
01:10:00.60 --> 01:10:01.60
That's all this stuff.

1563
01:10:01.60 --> 01:10:02.60
It's like, okay.

1564
01:10:02.60 --> 01:10:04.20
So what are you going to do about it?

1565
01:10:04.20 --> 01:10:05.84
So you can cry.

1566
01:10:05.84 --> 01:10:07.24
You totally can.

1567
01:10:07.24 --> 01:10:11.12
And you can complain about how junk that is that the milk, that spill to your toy

1568
01:10:11.12 --> 01:10:12.84
broker, whatever the situation.

1569
01:10:12.84 --> 01:10:14.40
Yeah, because that's all truth.

1570
01:10:14.40 --> 01:10:15.40
Absolutely true.

1571
01:10:15.40 --> 01:10:16.40
And good.

1572
01:10:16.40 --> 01:10:17.40
You can cry whatever.

1573
01:10:17.40 --> 01:10:18.40
You're going to do about it.

1574
01:10:18.40 --> 01:10:19.96
Then, okay, then that's what it's going to be.

1575
01:10:19.96 --> 01:10:20.96
And that's all it's going to be.

1576
01:10:20.96 --> 01:10:22.24
You're going to continue to cry.

1577
01:10:22.24 --> 01:10:26.68
And you're probably going to continue to cry next time it happens to or you clean up the milk,

1578
01:10:26.68 --> 01:10:28.80
you fix your toy, whatever, you know, whatever.

1579
01:10:28.80 --> 01:10:29.80
What are you going to do about it?

1580
01:10:29.80 --> 01:10:31.000
That's the whole thing, you know?

1581
01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:32.000
What are you going to do about it?

1582
01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:33.000
It's interesting to you.

1583
01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:40.08
There's like a just a known, the right answer seems really obvious when we talk about it

1584
01:10:40.08 --> 01:10:41.08
right now.

1585
01:10:41.08 --> 01:10:42.68
But not many people see that right answer.

1586
01:10:42.68 --> 01:10:43.68
No.

1587
01:10:43.68 --> 01:10:47.08
Most people want to just be mad at their boss and be frustrated and undermine them.

1588
01:10:47.08 --> 01:10:50.28
And not work hard so that they don't get any shine on them.

1589
01:10:50.28 --> 01:10:51.28
So, okay, great.

1590
01:10:51.28 --> 01:10:53.56
That's you putting yourself on that barrel, too.

1591
01:10:53.56 --> 01:10:54.56
Don't do it.

1592
01:10:54.56 --> 01:10:55.56
Just crazy.

1593
01:10:55.56 --> 01:10:56.56
Yeah.

1594
01:10:56.56 --> 01:10:57.56
It's good.

1595
01:10:57.56 --> 01:10:58.56
Actuation say it's crazy.

1596
01:10:58.56 --> 01:10:59.56
It's, it makes sense.

1597
01:10:59.56 --> 01:11:02.16
I mean, I felt that before.

1598
01:11:02.16 --> 01:11:03.16
100%.

1599
01:11:03.16 --> 01:11:04.16
Yeah.

1600
01:11:04.16 --> 01:11:05.16
Oh, for sure.

1601
01:11:05.16 --> 01:11:06.16
For sure.

1602
01:11:06.16 --> 01:11:07.16
Next question.

1603
01:11:07.16 --> 01:11:13.20
Can you be default aggressive and relaxed in jujitsu?

1604
01:11:13.20 --> 01:11:14.20
Okay.

1605
01:11:14.20 --> 01:11:15.20
Yeah.

1606
01:11:15.20 --> 01:11:19.16
Yeah, this seems like two opposing things that you can't do at the same time, but the

1607
01:11:19.16 --> 01:11:22.16
actual fact is yes, you can and you should.

1608
01:11:22.16 --> 01:11:26.60
So you want your maneuvers to be aggressive, but you don't want to be using a bunch

1609
01:11:26.60 --> 01:11:29.28
of strength to execute the maneuvers, right?

1610
01:11:29.28 --> 01:11:36.52
You want to aggressively escape your opponent's position before your opponent gets settled.

1611
01:11:36.52 --> 01:11:39.12
Therefore, you don't have to use strength.

1612
01:11:39.12 --> 01:11:40.44
You can use relax it.

1613
01:11:40.44 --> 01:11:41.44
You can relax.

1614
01:11:41.44 --> 01:11:45.92
And you can be proactive, same thing with defending a submission attempt.

1615
01:11:45.92 --> 01:11:52.000
You want to defend that submission attempt aggressively before this submission attempt gets

1616
01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.40
settled in.

1617
01:11:54.40 --> 01:11:57.20
You want to move aggressively.

1618
01:11:57.20 --> 01:12:00.04
Again, I'm not talking about strength and spashing.

1619
01:12:00.04 --> 01:12:05.60
I'm talking about moving aggressively before your opponent moves and get ahead of them on

1620
01:12:05.60 --> 01:12:06.60
their U-loop.

1621
01:12:06.60 --> 01:12:10.56
When you get ahead of them on their U-loop, they're going to have issues with you.

1622
01:12:10.56 --> 01:12:13.24
And so yeah, absolutely.

1623
01:12:13.24 --> 01:12:16.72
You can be default aggressive and at the same time you can be relaxed and you should

1624
01:12:16.72 --> 01:12:18.84
that should be your goal.

1625
01:12:18.84 --> 01:12:20.72
Do you sometimes have to use strength in Gjitsu?

1626
01:12:20.72 --> 01:12:22.36
Yes, you do.

1627
01:12:22.36 --> 01:12:23.84
Yes, you do.

1628
01:12:23.84 --> 01:12:25.80
Sometimes you've got to power out of something.

1629
01:12:25.80 --> 01:12:29.52
Why did the reason you had to power out of something is because you were too late because

1630
01:12:29.52 --> 01:12:32.36
you weren't moving aggressively enough.

1631
01:12:32.36 --> 01:12:33.76
You weren't moving quickly enough.

1632
01:12:33.76 --> 01:12:38.24
Because then you got to power out of something and claw those hands, claw that guillotine off

1633
01:12:38.24 --> 01:12:39.24
your neck.

1634
01:12:39.24 --> 01:12:40.24
Do you know what I'm saying?

1635
01:12:40.24 --> 01:12:43.20
You're telling someone they're clawing your fingers away from their neck?

1636
01:12:43.20 --> 01:12:44.20
Yes.

1637
01:12:44.20 --> 01:12:47.92
So when that happens, that person was late.

1638
01:12:47.92 --> 01:12:52.72
And now they're clawing the resorting to strength and resorting to panic, clawing

1639
01:12:52.72 --> 01:12:53.72
at your fingers.

1640
01:12:53.72 --> 01:12:55.60
So no, usually it doesn't even matter.

1641
01:12:55.60 --> 01:12:56.60
They can claw.

1642
01:12:56.60 --> 01:12:57.60
It doesn't matter.

1643
01:12:57.60 --> 01:12:58.60
Good.

1644
01:12:58.60 --> 01:12:59.60
No.

1645
01:12:59.60 --> 01:13:00.60
I like that sense of panic.

1646
01:13:00.60 --> 01:13:02.60
But I feel when they're clawing.

1647
01:13:02.60 --> 01:13:03.60
Yeah, I'm sure you do.

1648
01:13:03.60 --> 01:13:06.48
You really seem like you like it a lot.

1649
01:13:06.48 --> 01:13:07.96
So that's what it is.

1650
01:13:07.96 --> 01:13:09.80
And by the way, this is true in life as well.

1651
01:13:09.80 --> 01:13:18.88
You do like if you are maneuvering correctly, correctly as a leader, you don't have to

1652
01:13:18.88 --> 01:13:24.04
get aggressive at people because they're doing what they're supposed to be doing.

1653
01:13:24.04 --> 01:13:25.52
You don't have to be.

1654
01:13:25.52 --> 01:13:26.52
You shouldn't have to yell.

1655
01:13:26.52 --> 01:13:28.16
If you have to yell as a boss, guess what?

1656
01:13:28.16 --> 01:13:30.08
Your intent wasn't followed.

1657
01:13:30.08 --> 01:13:31.40
Your plan wasn't understood.

1658
01:13:31.40 --> 01:13:34.52
There's so many mistakes that you made if you're yelling as a leader.

1659
01:13:34.52 --> 01:13:35.52
Do you never have to yell?

1660
01:13:35.52 --> 01:13:37.64
Yeah, certainly, sometimes you can yell because you got to make sure you get that emotional

1661
01:13:37.64 --> 01:13:40.44
point across sometimes, you got to make sure that someone really likes someone doesn't seem

1662
01:13:40.44 --> 01:13:43.80
to realize that they may just severe enough that they're warned to yelling and therefore

1663
01:13:43.80 --> 01:13:46.80
it doesn't matter to them because they're dad yelling in their whole life.

1664
01:13:46.80 --> 01:13:48.76
So if you're not yelling, they don't get it.

1665
01:13:48.76 --> 01:13:50.76
So can you can you run to that?

1666
01:13:50.76 --> 01:13:51.76
Problem occasionally.

1667
01:13:51.76 --> 01:13:53.72
Occasionally, very occasionally.

1668
01:13:53.72 --> 01:13:58.52
Very rarely should you run into that situation because if you're doing the right job being

1669
01:13:58.52 --> 01:14:04.24
default, aggressive as a leader, you should be in situations where you never have to yell

1670
01:14:04.24 --> 01:14:09.76
because your people understand what it is that they're supposed to be doing.

1671
01:14:09.76 --> 01:14:11.84
They understand why they're supposed to be doing it.

1672
01:14:11.84 --> 01:14:13.04
They understand what the plan is.

1673
01:14:13.04 --> 01:14:14.48
They understand what the contingencies were.

1674
01:14:14.48 --> 01:14:18.88
They understand what the intent that you had was.

1675
01:14:18.88 --> 01:14:22.36
They understand this way that this fits strategically into the situation.

1676
01:14:22.36 --> 01:14:25.32
They understand all those things and if they understand all those things, then they're

1677
01:14:25.32 --> 01:14:26.32
going to do the right thing.

1678
01:14:26.32 --> 01:14:30.60
And if they don't, if they understand all those things and they still do something that doesn't

1679
01:14:30.60 --> 01:14:33.92
make sense, well, maybe they do deserve to yell that.

1680
01:14:33.92 --> 01:14:36.96
But again, all the first person I check is myself.

1681
01:14:36.96 --> 01:14:40.80
And say, well, obviously, I'd make this clear enough.

1682
01:14:40.80 --> 01:14:44.52
So yes, relax harder.

1683
01:14:44.52 --> 01:14:50.04
So yelling is to leading as using strength is to do you get to.

1684
01:14:50.04 --> 01:14:51.04
So what?

1685
01:14:51.04 --> 01:14:52.04
You gotta do it everyone.

1686
01:14:52.04 --> 01:14:58.28
So if you lay, maybe you lacked on your technique earlier, you gotta make a little

1687
01:14:58.28 --> 01:14:59.28
end.

1688
01:14:59.28 --> 01:15:01.08
But think about this.

1689
01:15:01.08 --> 01:15:02.24
You hurt your stamina.

1690
01:15:02.24 --> 01:15:04.24
Yeah, you're straight.

1691
01:15:04.24 --> 01:15:05.24
And with your little piece of stuff.

1692
01:15:05.24 --> 01:15:08.96
When I yell at you, because something went wrong and you're my subordinate, when

1693
01:15:08.96 --> 01:15:11.76
I yell at you, I pay a little price for that, too.

1694
01:15:11.76 --> 01:15:14.04
Because it better be important.

1695
01:15:14.04 --> 01:15:17.52
And I better really think about it, because I didn't do anything to build our relationship

1696
01:15:17.52 --> 01:15:19.52
and a positive manner by yelling at you.

1697
01:15:19.52 --> 01:15:21.08
Didn't do anything.

1698
01:15:21.08 --> 01:15:25.52
Just like you didn't improve your G2 technique or knowledge.

1699
01:15:25.52 --> 01:15:29.24
Or really, I guess you improved your situation for a moment, right?

1700
01:15:29.24 --> 01:15:30.24
Because you escaped.

1701
01:15:30.24 --> 01:15:31.24
But now you're more tired.

1702
01:15:31.24 --> 01:15:36.000
If I yell that you to do something and you did it, because you were like, okay, well, fine.

1703
01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:37.000
I don't want to yell that anymore.

1704
01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.52
So I'm just going to do this thing that you don't want to do.

1705
01:15:39.52 --> 01:15:41.56
That's temporary fix.

1706
01:15:41.56 --> 01:15:42.72
It's temporary fix.

1707
01:15:42.72 --> 01:15:44.76
It's temporary fix.

1708
01:15:44.76 --> 01:15:47.88
Yeah, you know how like JPL say, aggressive.

1709
01:15:47.88 --> 01:15:49.68
Is it, or default aggressive?

1710
01:15:49.68 --> 01:15:50.84
Is it towards people?

1711
01:15:50.84 --> 01:15:52.40
It's towards making things happen.

1712
01:15:52.40 --> 01:15:54.60
So like, so did you just the same thing?

1713
01:15:54.60 --> 01:15:56.24
So it's like, I don't aggressively.

1714
01:15:56.24 --> 01:15:58.48
Like, it's in a way.

1715
01:15:58.48 --> 01:16:00.68
You kind of can narrow it down to the timing thing.

1716
01:16:00.68 --> 01:16:04.000
It's like it's like it's either taking action or hesitating kind of thing.

1717
01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:05.64
So you just don't really hesitate.

1718
01:16:05.64 --> 01:16:08.48
You can lay back if that's part of the strategy and stuff like that.

1719
01:16:08.48 --> 01:16:10.12
You can relax once part of the strategy.

1720
01:16:10.12 --> 01:16:11.32
But it's about making things happen.

1721
01:16:11.32 --> 01:16:12.40
Like, what are you trying to make things happen?

1722
01:16:12.40 --> 01:16:13.40
Timing wise.

1723
01:16:13.40 --> 01:16:15.44
So you know how like you have the thing to embarrass us.

1724
01:16:15.44 --> 01:16:17.80
What is the disrespect?

1725
01:16:17.80 --> 01:16:18.80
Remember you asked me that?

1726
01:16:18.80 --> 01:16:19.80
What's the disrespect?

1727
01:16:19.80 --> 01:16:21.80
Oh, it's the G2.

1728
01:16:21.80 --> 01:16:22.80
Yeah, go pass.

1729
01:16:22.80 --> 01:16:23.52
You're a G.

1730
01:16:23.52 --> 01:16:27.44
They you made up, but you made up the terminology as well.

1731
01:16:27.44 --> 01:16:32.76
So the disrespect is basically, when a guy pulls guard or you're in a guard scenario,

1732
01:16:32.76 --> 01:16:35.56
it's actually not even a guard scenario yet.

1733
01:16:35.56 --> 01:16:39.60
It's like you essentially treat that person like they don't even have a guard.

1734
01:16:39.60 --> 01:16:41.24
Like the guard doesn't even exist.

1735
01:16:41.24 --> 01:16:43.92
That's how little respect you have for the guard in then you just pass.

1736
01:16:43.92 --> 01:16:47.88
But when you kind of think about it when I think about it when you've done it to me the

1737
01:16:47.88 --> 01:16:51.20
times you have, it is literally that.

1738
01:16:51.20 --> 01:16:56.36
So before I can establish any kind of position to establish guard, you're just, yeah,

1739
01:16:56.36 --> 01:16:59.80
you're a pass it, you're done, you don't even consider the guard.

1740
01:16:59.80 --> 01:17:03.80
You know what's weird is, is where people get confused on this though, is they think,

1741
01:17:03.80 --> 01:17:05.76
oh, so you're saying move faster.

1742
01:17:05.76 --> 01:17:06.76
Yeah, right?

1743
01:17:06.76 --> 01:17:07.76
That's the weird thing.

1744
01:17:07.76 --> 01:17:09.08
Yeah, it is.

1745
01:17:09.08 --> 01:17:16.000
It's not, I'm sure I'll think of this at a later time, but it's not about moving faster.

1746
01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:17.000
Yes.

1747
01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:18.20
It's about moving more aggressively.

1748
01:17:18.20 --> 01:17:19.20
Yeah, it's not faster.

1749
01:17:19.20 --> 01:17:24.60
It's like being proactive and being aggressive and shutting down the situation before

1750
01:17:24.60 --> 01:17:27.68
or even becomes the situation that you know what's going to become.

1751
01:17:27.68 --> 01:17:32.32
Yeah, so if you take, like you said, like if you take a take in action and hesitation

1752
01:17:32.32 --> 01:17:36.000
you take those two, it's basically you're narrowing the hesitation down to zero.

1753
01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:37.000
It's possible.

1754
01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:38.32
That's literally what it is.

1755
01:17:38.32 --> 01:17:39.72
Yeah, just take action.

1756
01:17:39.72 --> 01:17:44.52
And again, you can relax, you can wait, but it's not hesitation waiting.

1757
01:17:44.52 --> 01:17:48.60
It's waiting, it's like more like being patient or waiting for a very specific reason.

1758
01:17:48.60 --> 01:17:51.24
You can do all those things, but there's no hesitation.

1759
01:17:51.24 --> 01:17:53.36
That's what I think that is.

1760
01:17:53.36 --> 01:17:55.36
And then obviously it's going to vary from the system.

1761
01:17:55.36 --> 01:18:00.92
Yeah, this is something you hear over and over and over again in combat leadership philosophies.

1762
01:18:00.92 --> 01:18:03.88
Like doing something now is better than waiting.

1763
01:18:03.88 --> 01:18:08.48
Doing something, doing something that's pretty good right now is infinitely better than doing

1764
01:18:08.48 --> 01:18:10.28
something that's great in two days.

1765
01:18:10.28 --> 01:18:13.000
Yeah, good when better than a great thing.

1766
01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:14.96
It's like the aggressive makes something happen.

1767
01:18:14.96 --> 01:18:17.80
Like that is so important.

1768
01:18:17.80 --> 01:18:18.80
Can you overdo it?

1769
01:18:18.80 --> 01:18:19.80
Yes, you can.

1770
01:18:19.80 --> 01:18:20.80
Can you make stupid decisions?

1771
01:18:20.80 --> 01:18:22.28
Because you rushed, yes, you can.

1772
01:18:22.28 --> 01:18:23.64
Is there a dichotomy in this?

1773
01:18:23.64 --> 01:18:25.64
Absolutely, there is.

1774
01:18:25.64 --> 01:18:27.64
That's, there's a dichotomy in every part of it.

1775
01:18:27.64 --> 01:18:31.52
So in every type of leadership, there's a dichotomy in Getsu, right?

1776
01:18:31.52 --> 01:18:35.88
There's a dichotomy because if I just rushed to a situation, well, that might be the

1777
01:18:35.88 --> 01:18:37.44
situation that you want to be to rushed to.

1778
01:18:37.44 --> 01:18:39.20
You gave me the opening, the trap.

1779
01:18:39.20 --> 01:18:41.20
Yeah, the trap.

1780
01:18:41.20 --> 01:18:44.88
So it's like, you know, when you're helping your friend move and then you get like three

1781
01:18:44.88 --> 01:18:50.000
four other friends, you know, and everyone's waiting around to be like, okay, where do

1782
01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:51.000
we start?

1783
01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:52.80
Okay, where do we put, you know, where do we start?

1784
01:18:52.80 --> 01:18:54.64
Who's starting first kind of thing?

1785
01:18:54.64 --> 01:18:57.12
The default aggressive guy is just going to start moving stuff.

1786
01:18:57.12 --> 01:18:58.12
Yeah.

1787
01:18:58.12 --> 01:19:01.40
And that seemed like, okay, that's like a little lighthearted scenario, but that's

1788
01:19:01.40 --> 01:19:02.40
real.

1789
01:19:02.40 --> 01:19:03.40
That's what I would run into it.

1790
01:19:03.40 --> 01:19:06.52
You know, when there's a bunch of people and we're all capable of making the decision,

1791
01:19:06.52 --> 01:19:10.24
it kind of paralyzes everyone because this is so true.

1792
01:19:10.24 --> 01:19:13.56
That scenario that you're talking about, it happens over and over and over again in the business

1793
01:19:13.56 --> 01:19:14.56
world.

1794
01:19:14.56 --> 01:19:15.56
It happens over and over again on the battlefield.

1795
01:19:15.56 --> 01:19:19.56
It happens on the training field where there's a bunch of people in no one's

1796
01:19:19.56 --> 01:19:20.56
taking leadership decision.

1797
01:19:20.56 --> 01:19:24.40
Yeah, like you're all it takes is someone to say, hey, we're moving this over

1798
01:19:24.40 --> 01:19:25.40
here.

1799
01:19:25.40 --> 01:19:26.40
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1800
01:19:26.40 --> 01:19:27.40
They put all this to get all the stuff off the truck right now.

1801
01:19:27.40 --> 01:19:28.40
Boom.

1802
01:19:28.40 --> 01:19:29.68
Yeah, guys are like, okay, cool, we'll make it happen.

1803
01:19:29.68 --> 01:19:32.88
Yeah, like your oil rig scenario of the main one.

1804
01:19:32.88 --> 01:19:33.88
The exact same thing.

1805
01:19:33.88 --> 01:19:34.88
Yeah.

1806
01:19:34.88 --> 01:19:40.08
And if you're default aggressive, meaning that's your default.

1807
01:19:40.08 --> 01:19:41.08
That's your zero.

1808
01:19:41.08 --> 01:19:45.48
You're that 100% then you're just pandiling business.

1809
01:19:45.48 --> 01:19:46.48
Right.

1810
01:19:46.48 --> 01:19:48.08
Your whole life until you take it too far.

1811
01:19:48.08 --> 01:19:51.40
Yeah, and you're trying to run stuff that other people might have a better vision of

1812
01:19:51.40 --> 01:19:52.40
what to do.

1813
01:19:52.40 --> 01:19:58.60
Like if I might be, I found moldy moving for the first time ever on our moving team.

1814
01:19:58.60 --> 01:20:00.72
And I come in and I'm like, hey, guess what, hey, we're going to start getting this

1815
01:20:00.72 --> 01:20:01.72
to heavy stuff.

1816
01:20:01.72 --> 01:20:04.08
And you're like, hey, actually, that's not a good idea.

1817
01:20:04.08 --> 01:20:05.08
We should do this.

1818
01:20:05.08 --> 01:20:07.76
We should get this stuff in here in the truck first or whatever, right?

1819
01:20:07.76 --> 01:20:09.08
Because you've been doing it longer.

1820
01:20:09.08 --> 01:20:12.52
So even though it's got to be your default mode, again, there's a dichotomy you can

1821
01:20:12.52 --> 01:20:13.52
push it too far.

1822
01:20:13.52 --> 01:20:14.52
Put a keypire.

1823
01:20:14.52 --> 01:20:15.52
I'm so open.

1824
01:20:15.52 --> 01:20:16.52
That's a question.

1825
01:20:16.52 --> 01:20:18.88
More.

1826
01:20:18.88 --> 01:20:21.48
Jocco.

1827
01:20:21.48 --> 01:20:29.24
How do self-awareness, self-assessment, and self-improvement begin and how do they continue

1828
01:20:29.24 --> 01:20:31.24
over time?

1829
01:20:31.24 --> 01:20:36.96
Well, they're all tied together.

1830
01:20:36.96 --> 01:20:45.16
And it starts with being self-aware, with being able to detach.

1831
01:20:45.16 --> 01:20:53.52
Because if you can't attach from yourself, then you can't see yourself.

1832
01:20:53.52 --> 01:20:58.36
And so people ask, how do you detach from yourself?

1833
01:20:58.36 --> 01:20:59.52
How do you learn to do that?

1834
01:20:59.52 --> 01:21:06.80
And a good drill for this is try to imagine the way other people see you.

1835
01:21:06.80 --> 01:21:12.36
And what other people are thinking of you?

1836
01:21:12.36 --> 01:21:18.48
And one place where this happens and it definitely happens to me is when I started getting

1837
01:21:18.48 --> 01:21:23.88
putting charge of things, I started thinking about other people's perspectives.

1838
01:21:23.88 --> 01:21:26.28
What do they see?

1839
01:21:26.28 --> 01:21:30.40
If you're in charge, then what are your subordinates?

1840
01:21:30.40 --> 01:21:31.40
See you do.

1841
01:21:31.40 --> 01:21:32.76
What are your subordinates?

1842
01:21:32.76 --> 01:21:42.88
Are you saying what kind of representation are they receiving?

1843
01:21:42.88 --> 01:21:46.40
And if you work for someone else, it's the same questions.

1844
01:21:46.40 --> 01:21:48.72
What does the boss see me do?

1845
01:21:48.72 --> 01:21:51.20
What does the boss hear me say?

1846
01:21:51.20 --> 01:21:58.56
What kind of representation am I making of myself to my boss?

1847
01:21:58.56 --> 01:22:03.44
And then you start thinking about what are your friends and family think?

1848
01:22:03.44 --> 01:22:06.04
What do they see?

1849
01:22:06.04 --> 01:22:09.80
What do they hear?

1850
01:22:09.80 --> 01:22:14.96
And so the question becomes how well do you represent yourself?

1851
01:22:14.96 --> 01:22:17.52
What shortfalls do you have?

1852
01:22:17.52 --> 01:22:26.80
Now, when you first start looking, it's like you're looking at an overgrown lawn.

1853
01:22:26.80 --> 01:22:29.40
There are some big obvious problems.

1854
01:22:29.40 --> 01:22:34.56
So you do a broad, just kind of general cut of the grass.

1855
01:22:34.56 --> 01:22:39.56
You fix some of the big easy problems that are obvious.

1856
01:22:39.56 --> 01:22:42.36
I want you to done that.

1857
01:22:42.36 --> 01:22:46.04
I want you to have gotten rid of some of those big obvious problems.

1858
01:22:46.04 --> 01:22:49.52
You notice some more detailed problems.

1859
01:22:49.52 --> 01:22:50.92
So you then you handle them.

1860
01:22:50.92 --> 01:22:55.56
And once you've got those handled, you see even smaller and more detailed issues.

1861
01:22:55.56 --> 01:23:00.96
So you start trying to fix them.

1862
01:23:00.96 --> 01:23:03.76
And that's what you do with yourself.

1863
01:23:03.76 --> 01:23:10.60
You continually detach and then you look and then you refine and then you detach and then

1864
01:23:10.60 --> 01:23:16.08
you look and then you refine and then you detach and then you look and then you refine.

1865
01:23:16.08 --> 01:23:20.04
That's what you do.

1866
01:23:20.04 --> 01:23:22.40
That's how you get better.

1867
01:23:22.40 --> 01:23:25.60
And that process doesn't stop.

1868
01:23:25.60 --> 01:23:35.28
It can't stop because if you stop refining, then the weeds grow back and the next thing

1869
01:23:35.28 --> 01:23:38.88
you know, you can't see yourself anymore.

1870
01:23:38.88 --> 01:23:50.04
And when you can't see yourself anymore, when you stop looking at yourself, then you accept

1871
01:23:50.04 --> 01:23:53.96
anything.

1872
01:23:53.96 --> 01:23:57.52
And that's wrong.

1873
01:23:57.52 --> 01:23:59.32
Don't accept the faults.

1874
01:23:59.32 --> 01:24:02.16
Don't give yourself the benefit of the doubt.

1875
01:24:02.16 --> 01:24:10.20
You've got to be your own harshest critic.

1876
01:24:10.20 --> 01:24:22.36
And hold the line and don't let go.

1877
01:24:22.36 --> 01:24:28.36
And I think that's all I've got for tonight.

1878
01:24:28.36 --> 01:24:38.52
So echo Charles, if speaking of improving ourselves, should we have any recommendations

1879
01:24:38.52 --> 01:24:41.92
as to how we might be able to improve ourselves a little bit?

1880
01:24:41.92 --> 01:24:45.000
Sure, improve and maintain.

1881
01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:46.000
Improve maintain, improve maintain.

1882
01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:50.84
Well, something like that.

1883
01:24:50.84 --> 01:24:51.84
I would recommend.

1884
01:24:51.84 --> 01:24:53.96
Okay, let's start with the workout.

1885
01:24:53.96 --> 01:24:58.40
Work it out is established and known.

1886
01:24:58.40 --> 01:24:59.40
Well known.

1887
01:24:59.40 --> 01:25:03.84
By the way, to be one of the only things that you can do that all the fact every other

1888
01:25:03.84 --> 01:25:06.08
part of your life in a good way.

1889
01:25:06.08 --> 01:25:09.36
So also one of those things that will more health.

1890
01:25:09.36 --> 01:25:10.84
If you lose that, you lose everything.

1891
01:25:10.84 --> 01:25:13.08
It's one of those things.

1892
01:25:13.08 --> 01:25:17.28
So why do some of us not regard it in that way?

1893
01:25:17.28 --> 01:25:19.64
100% of the time.

1894
01:25:19.64 --> 01:25:22.92
Why do people not have time to exercise?

1895
01:25:22.92 --> 01:25:24.32
Lack of discipline.

1896
01:25:24.32 --> 01:25:25.32
Yeah.

1897
01:25:25.32 --> 01:25:26.32
Possibly.

1898
01:25:26.32 --> 01:25:29.12
It might be that short term payoff thing.

1899
01:25:29.12 --> 01:25:31.64
You know, it's natural to seek short term payoff.

1900
01:25:31.64 --> 01:25:32.64
It's natural.

1901
01:25:32.64 --> 01:25:33.64
Think that's it.

1902
01:25:33.64 --> 01:25:38.52
Because again, you lose your health, you lose everything straight up.

1903
01:25:38.52 --> 01:25:41.88
So why wouldn't it be first in the priority list?

1904
01:25:41.88 --> 01:25:43.20
I don't have time to exercise.

1905
01:25:43.20 --> 01:25:44.56
No, you have time to exercise.

1906
01:25:44.56 --> 01:25:48.64
You might not have time to rest to the stuff in life.

1907
01:25:48.64 --> 01:25:49.64
Really?

1908
01:25:49.64 --> 01:25:50.64
That's how it should be.

1909
01:25:50.64 --> 01:25:51.64
Right?

1910
01:25:51.64 --> 01:25:55.64
Nonetheless, when you're exercising, you join some like, do you generate?

1911
01:25:55.64 --> 01:25:57.96
But don't worry about that, even.

1912
01:25:57.96 --> 01:26:00.56
Because chocolate supplements, chocolate supplements.

1913
01:26:00.56 --> 01:26:04.56
Go super-crile oil. This will make it three for your joints for a lot of other stuff

1914
01:26:04.56 --> 01:26:05.56
too, by the way.

1915
01:26:05.56 --> 01:26:06.56
Brain.

1916
01:26:06.56 --> 01:26:07.56
Skin.

1917
01:26:07.56 --> 01:26:08.56
Skin tone.

1918
01:26:08.56 --> 01:26:10.56
That's like a supplemental thing.

1919
01:26:10.56 --> 01:26:11.56
But it is good for it nonetheless.

1920
01:26:11.56 --> 01:26:12.56
That's a fact.

1921
01:26:12.56 --> 01:26:14.56
And another one called jacquil joint warfare.

1922
01:26:14.56 --> 01:26:20.96
So your joints, when you start to lose the functionality of your joints, not only

1923
01:26:20.96 --> 01:26:29.96
does it make workouts less desirable, less fun, effective, less fun, less everything.

1924
01:26:29.96 --> 01:26:33.96
It can jam up your health.

1925
01:26:33.96 --> 01:26:34.96
Physically, you can be less capable.

1926
01:26:34.96 --> 01:26:35.96
So you want to maintain your joints.

1927
01:26:35.96 --> 01:26:39.96
I didn't know this, but now that I do, I'm never looking back.

1928
01:26:39.96 --> 01:26:42.96
Jacquil super-crile, take that and join warfare, maintain the joints.

1929
01:26:42.96 --> 01:26:44.96
Maintain the joint health.

1930
01:26:44.96 --> 01:26:46.96
Everything will be there.

1931
01:26:46.96 --> 01:26:47.96
Get the subscription so you don't run out.

1932
01:26:47.96 --> 01:26:48.96
That's what I say.

1933
01:26:48.96 --> 01:26:49.96
Straight up.

1934
01:26:49.96 --> 01:26:51.96
There's a panic mode if you run out.

1935
01:26:51.96 --> 01:26:53.96
Yeah, and you don't want that panic mode.

1936
01:26:53.96 --> 01:26:54.96
You don't even need that panic mode.

1937
01:26:54.96 --> 01:26:56.96
You don't need that in your life, even.

1938
01:26:56.96 --> 01:26:57.96
So wife and father.

1939
01:26:57.96 --> 01:26:59.96
You don't get the subscription, do the recurring one every month.

1940
01:26:59.96 --> 01:27:00.96
Everything wants to have an off-ing.

1941
01:27:00.96 --> 01:27:01.96
You take them.

1942
01:27:01.96 --> 01:27:04.96
Depending, you know, how, how nuts you want to get.

1943
01:27:04.96 --> 01:27:06.96
Also, jacquil has a supplement.

1944
01:27:06.96 --> 01:27:10.96
This is for your brain and your body.

1945
01:27:10.96 --> 01:27:11.96
All in one.

1946
01:27:11.96 --> 01:27:16.96
You don't have to take the pre-workout and the cognitive enhancing new tropic.

1947
01:27:16.96 --> 01:27:17.96
You don't have to do that anywhere.

1948
01:27:17.96 --> 01:27:19.96
You take to just the one called discipline.

1949
01:27:19.96 --> 01:27:21.96
Takes good to, 11-line.

1950
01:27:21.96 --> 01:27:23.96
For a small to-plier.

1951
01:27:23.96 --> 01:27:24.96
Oh, we got it.

1952
01:27:24.96 --> 01:27:25.96
No.

1953
01:27:25.96 --> 01:27:26.96
No.

1954
01:27:26.96 --> 01:27:27.96
Well, that's a good one.

1955
01:27:27.96 --> 01:27:28.96
Take that. That'll help you.

1956
01:27:28.96 --> 01:27:30.96
That'll help you to stay on task.

1957
01:27:30.96 --> 01:27:33.96
Find all the words that you're looking for to use.

1958
01:27:33.96 --> 01:27:36.96
You know, you don't want to, what do you call that anyway?

1959
01:27:36.96 --> 01:27:38.96
That brain, far-brain, far-certainly more.

1960
01:27:38.96 --> 01:27:41.96
Not lanes, not lane, it's not lane, it's a lane word when I say it.

1961
01:27:41.96 --> 01:27:42.96
Absent, mind, didn't this?

1962
01:27:42.96 --> 01:27:43.96
Absent, mind, didn't this?

1963
01:27:43.96 --> 01:27:46.96
You know, it kind of combats all that stuff.

1964
01:27:46.96 --> 01:27:49.96
Present, mind, madness is the opposite of apps.

1965
01:27:49.96 --> 01:27:50.96
Technically.

1966
01:27:50.96 --> 01:27:51.96
Right, that's technically, yeah.

1967
01:27:51.96 --> 01:27:53.96
Nonetheless, promote that.

1968
01:27:53.96 --> 01:27:55.96
And you're all good. It's called discipline.

1969
01:27:55.96 --> 01:27:58.96
Get all these at originmain.com.

1970
01:27:58.96 --> 01:28:00.96
The company is origin. I say origin main.

1971
01:28:00.96 --> 01:28:03.96
I just, that's the company I say it's origin main.

1972
01:28:03.96 --> 01:28:04.96
But it's really called origin.

1973
01:28:04.96 --> 01:28:05.96
It's in main.

1974
01:28:05.96 --> 01:28:08.96
The website is originmain.com.

1975
01:28:08.96 --> 01:28:10.96
Also an origin main.

1976
01:28:10.96 --> 01:28:12.96
Gees and Rashgarts for your jiu-jitsu journey.

1977
01:28:12.96 --> 01:28:14.96
Important journey, by the way.

1978
01:28:14.96 --> 01:28:16.96
I would say 90.

1979
01:28:16.96 --> 01:28:17.96
I would say everyone.

1980
01:28:17.96 --> 01:28:19.96
100% 100%.

1981
01:28:19.96 --> 01:28:22.96
Almost 100% of people who start jiu-jitsu will say, okay, it's valuable.

1982
01:28:22.96 --> 01:28:26.96
Whether they stick with it or not, you cannot deny the value of jiu-jitsu.

1983
01:28:26.96 --> 01:28:29.96
Even though that one of the questions earlier,

1984
01:28:29.96 --> 01:28:32.96
boom, you inoculate yourself, you know,

1985
01:28:32.96 --> 01:28:33.96
to all these things.

1986
01:28:33.96 --> 01:28:35.96
And it's weird how it affects the rest of your life.

1987
01:28:35.96 --> 01:28:37.96
Jiu-jitsu is good.

1988
01:28:37.96 --> 01:28:38.96
Yeah, for your whole life.

1989
01:28:38.96 --> 01:28:39.96
Yeah.

1990
01:28:39.96 --> 01:28:41.96
Nonetheless, when you start, you get asked,

1991
01:28:41.96 --> 01:28:43.96
what gees should I get?

1992
01:28:43.96 --> 01:28:44.96
Guess what? Origin.

1993
01:28:44.96 --> 01:28:46.96
You get an origin-gee, main in America.

1994
01:28:46.96 --> 01:28:48.96
The fabrics made in America.

1995
01:28:48.96 --> 01:28:51.96
The cotton to make the fabric is made in America.

1996
01:28:51.96 --> 01:28:53.96
We're going all the way down to grown.

1997
01:28:53.96 --> 01:28:56.96
He's straight up from dirt, from the dirt.

1998
01:28:56.96 --> 01:28:57.96
To the sugar.

1999
01:28:57.96 --> 01:28:59.96
To the geetop, to all that stuff.

2000
01:28:59.96 --> 01:29:01.96
They also got hoodies.

2001
01:29:01.96 --> 01:29:06.96
Pizza and me some new sweat suit situation.

2002
01:29:06.96 --> 01:29:07.96
No, joggers.

2003
01:29:07.96 --> 01:29:08.96
Are they nice?

2004
01:29:08.96 --> 01:29:09.96
Got them on right now.

2005
01:29:09.96 --> 01:29:11.96
Straight up, most comfortable.

2006
01:29:11.96 --> 01:29:12.96
Most comfortable clothes.

2007
01:29:12.96 --> 01:29:14.96
Most comfortable clothes.

2008
01:29:14.96 --> 01:29:16.96
Close.

2009
01:29:16.96 --> 01:29:18.96
This goes for all clothing.

2010
01:29:18.96 --> 01:29:19.96
I've ever had.

2011
01:29:19.96 --> 01:29:21.96
And that's saying a lot.

2012
01:29:21.96 --> 01:29:23.96
It's really most comfortable for us.

2013
01:29:23.96 --> 01:29:25.96
Straight up is straight up.

2014
01:29:25.96 --> 01:29:26.96
Yes.

2015
01:29:26.96 --> 01:29:27.96
100%.

2016
01:29:27.96 --> 01:29:29.96
Is it because it's made in America?

2017
01:29:29.96 --> 01:29:30.96
Maybe, maybe not.

2018
01:29:30.96 --> 01:29:33.96
But it does speak a lot for the quality of origin in it of itself.

2019
01:29:33.96 --> 01:29:36.96
And oh, wait, it's comfortable because it was made in America.

2020
01:29:36.96 --> 01:29:37.96
That's the question.

2021
01:29:37.96 --> 01:29:38.96
Is it?

2022
01:29:38.96 --> 01:29:39.96
Or isn't it?

2023
01:29:39.96 --> 01:29:40.96
I don't know.

2024
01:29:40.96 --> 01:29:41.96
But it is comfortable.

2025
01:29:41.96 --> 01:29:42.96
100%.

2026
01:29:42.96 --> 01:29:43.96
The most comfortable.

2027
01:29:43.96 --> 01:29:44.96
That's a good type.

2028
01:29:44.96 --> 01:29:45.96
I know it is.

2029
01:29:45.96 --> 01:29:47.96
Because you are one that deals high and comfort.

2030
01:29:47.96 --> 01:29:48.96
Yes.

2031
01:29:48.96 --> 01:29:49.96
I mean, comfort kind of sore.

2032
01:29:49.96 --> 01:29:50.96
100%.

2033
01:29:50.96 --> 01:29:53.96
And this one graded off the charts.

2034
01:29:53.96 --> 01:29:54.96
Check.

2035
01:29:54.96 --> 01:29:55.96
But later, you take a break.

2036
01:29:55.96 --> 01:29:57.96
So I export stuff.

2037
01:29:57.96 --> 01:30:00.96
You know, in video editing, especially if actually you had to export.

2038
01:30:00.96 --> 01:30:02.96
So 3D stuff, export takes long time.

2039
01:30:02.96 --> 01:30:04.96
3D studio max.

2040
01:30:04.96 --> 01:30:05.96
So what it's called.

2041
01:30:05.96 --> 01:30:07.96
Ticks long time.

2042
01:30:07.96 --> 01:30:11.96
So while it exports, you start using your computer doing other things.

2043
01:30:11.96 --> 01:30:13.96
It kind of, you know, you can jam your up.

2044
01:30:13.96 --> 01:30:14.96
It'll slow down your computer whatever.

2045
01:30:14.96 --> 01:30:15.96
So you know, I take a little break.

2046
01:30:15.96 --> 01:30:16.96
I'm going to lay it out on the couch.

2047
01:30:16.96 --> 01:30:18.96
I'm going to order you in whole sweat suit on.

2048
01:30:18.96 --> 01:30:19.96
Get some.

2049
01:30:19.96 --> 01:30:20.96
And I lay down on the couch.

2050
01:30:20.96 --> 01:30:25.96
And like this for some reason, I'm the most comfortable I've ever been in my life.

2051
01:30:25.96 --> 01:30:26.96
You need to make.

2052
01:30:26.96 --> 01:30:27.96
I'll talk to Pete.

2053
01:30:27.96 --> 01:30:31.96
You need like a signature series.

2054
01:30:31.96 --> 01:30:32.96
Come for it.

2055
01:30:32.96 --> 01:30:33.96
Come for it.

2056
01:30:33.96 --> 01:30:34.96
Yeah.

2057
01:30:34.96 --> 01:30:35.96
Yeah.

2058
01:30:35.96 --> 01:30:36.96
Yeah.

2059
01:30:36.96 --> 01:30:37.96
Right.

2060
01:30:37.96 --> 01:30:37.96
Have it on right now.

2061
01:30:37.96 --> 01:30:38.96
That's it.

2062
01:30:38.96 --> 01:30:39.96
You know, you got to do a rename and embroidery on the side.

2063
01:30:39.96 --> 01:30:40.96
Boom.

2064
01:30:40.96 --> 01:30:41.96
That's awesome.

2065
01:30:41.96 --> 01:30:42.96
That's it.

2066
01:30:42.96 --> 01:30:43.96
You know, you got to do a rename and embroidery on the side.

2067
01:30:43.96 --> 01:30:44.96
Boom.

2068
01:30:44.96 --> 01:30:45.96
That's awesome.

2069
01:30:45.96 --> 01:30:47.96
So comfort is kind of a subjective thing.

2070
01:30:47.96 --> 01:30:48.96
Maybe.

2071
01:30:48.96 --> 01:30:49.96
Well, okay.

2072
01:30:49.96 --> 01:30:50.96
I challenge anyone.

2073
01:30:50.96 --> 01:30:54.96
If you have the origin sweatsuit or if you get one, get on it.

2074
01:30:54.96 --> 01:30:56.96
Lay it on on your couch.

2075
01:30:56.96 --> 01:30:59.96
Temperature would have to be just right because if it's hot and you have sweatsuit on,

2076
01:30:59.96 --> 01:31:00.96
and nothing is comfortable.

2077
01:31:00.96 --> 01:31:02.96
But keep that in mind.

2078
01:31:02.96 --> 01:31:03.96
I challenge you to do that.

2079
01:31:03.96 --> 01:31:04.96
Report back.

2080
01:31:04.96 --> 01:31:07.96
If it's not the most comfortable, let me know for 100%.

2081
01:31:07.96 --> 01:31:10.96
You're going to taste them for real comfort.

2082
01:31:10.96 --> 01:31:12.96
American made comfort to buy the way.

2083
01:31:12.96 --> 01:31:13.96
Also.

2084
01:31:13.96 --> 01:31:16.96
If you're into jujitsu.

2085
01:31:16.96 --> 01:31:17.96
Right.

2086
01:31:17.96 --> 01:31:22.96
If you're not into jujitsu, there was a jujitsu immersion camp on all this 26 this year.

2087
01:31:22.96 --> 01:31:24.96
Goes to September 2nd, one week.

2088
01:31:24.96 --> 01:31:26.96
Two sessions in that one week.

2089
01:31:26.96 --> 01:31:27.96
Yeah.

2090
01:31:27.96 --> 01:31:28.96
I'm going.

2091
01:31:28.96 --> 01:31:29.96
Jocca's doing going.

2092
01:31:29.96 --> 01:31:30.96
And so it's Dave Burke.

2093
01:31:30.96 --> 01:31:31.96
The real top gun.

2094
01:31:31.96 --> 01:31:32.96
The real top gun.

2095
01:31:32.96 --> 01:31:33.96
Burke.

2096
01:31:33.96 --> 01:31:34.96
Yes.

2097
01:31:34.96 --> 01:31:34.96
Good deal.

2098
01:31:34.96 --> 01:31:36.96
You know why he's going?

2099
01:31:36.96 --> 01:31:37.96
He sounded like a good deal.

2100
01:31:37.96 --> 01:31:39.96
It's a good deal.

2101
01:31:39.96 --> 01:31:40.96
It's a good deal.

2102
01:31:40.96 --> 01:31:43.96
It's a good deal.

2103
01:31:43.96 --> 01:31:44.96
It's a good deal.

2104
01:31:44.96 --> 01:31:45.96
It's a good deal.

2105
01:31:45.96 --> 01:31:46.96
It's a good deal.

2106
01:31:46.96 --> 01:31:48.96
It's a good deal.

2107
01:31:48.96 --> 01:31:49.96
It's a good deal.

2108
01:31:49.96 --> 01:31:50.96
It's a good deal.

2109
01:31:50.96 --> 01:31:51.96
It's a good deal.

2110
01:31:51.96 --> 01:31:53.96
It's a win, win, win, win.

2111
01:31:53.96 --> 01:31:54.96
It's like the best.

2112
01:31:54.96 --> 01:31:55.96
A good deal.

2113
01:31:55.96 --> 01:31:56.96
It's like the best case scenario kind of thing.

2114
01:31:56.96 --> 01:31:58.96
That's what a good deal Dave is all about.

2115
01:31:58.96 --> 01:31:59.96
That's just him.

2116
01:31:59.96 --> 01:32:00.96
That's how he is.

2117
01:32:00.96 --> 01:32:01.96
How he rolls.

2118
01:32:01.96 --> 01:32:02.96
Unless.

2119
01:32:02.96 --> 01:32:03.96
Other people would be there.

2120
01:32:03.96 --> 01:32:04.96
It wasn't either.

2121
01:32:04.96 --> 01:32:05.96
Hopefully JP.

2122
01:32:05.96 --> 01:32:06.96
Yeah.

2123
01:32:06.96 --> 01:32:07.96
And life.

2124
01:32:07.96 --> 01:32:09.96
Well, life just got his a strike.

2125
01:32:09.96 --> 01:32:11.96
Another strike on the white belt.

2126
01:32:11.96 --> 01:32:12.96
No white belt.

2127
01:32:12.96 --> 01:32:13.96
Yeah.

2128
01:32:13.96 --> 01:32:14.96
So he might very well be there.

2129
01:32:14.96 --> 01:32:16.96
I think I'll be able to do it by that.

2130
01:32:16.96 --> 01:32:17.96
Maybe.

2131
01:32:17.96 --> 01:32:18.96
Should this pace?

2132
01:32:18.96 --> 01:32:19.96
Yeah.

2133
01:32:19.96 --> 01:32:20.96
If he keeps trading hard.

2134
01:32:20.96 --> 01:32:21.96
Yeah.

2135
01:32:21.96 --> 01:32:22.96
And he has part of the knowledge as well.

2136
01:32:22.96 --> 01:32:23.96
Yeah.

2137
01:32:23.96 --> 01:32:24.96
He never know.

2138
01:32:24.96 --> 01:32:25.96
Yeah.

2139
01:32:25.96 --> 01:32:26.96
So did you see, immerse yourself in your just to best

2140
01:32:26.96 --> 01:32:27.96
wait and learn in my opinion.

2141
01:32:27.96 --> 01:32:28.96
Mine too.

2142
01:32:28.96 --> 01:32:30.96
Not even if you've never gone go.

2143
01:32:30.96 --> 01:32:36.96
Because last time I even went on the side with beginner beginners.

2144
01:32:36.96 --> 01:32:39.96
Like one day zero days experience boom.

2145
01:32:39.96 --> 01:32:43.96
We go through some stuff from and I'm not saying look cool.

2146
01:32:43.96 --> 01:32:44.96
I'm such a good teacher.

2147
01:32:44.96 --> 01:32:45.96
I'm not saying that at all.

2148
01:32:45.96 --> 01:32:49.96
But after like that session, they were ready to go start rolling.

2149
01:32:49.96 --> 01:32:50.96
Humble brag.

2150
01:32:50.96 --> 01:32:52.96
Just saying.

2151
01:32:52.96 --> 01:32:54.96
I know this because that's what they said.

2152
01:32:54.96 --> 01:32:57.96
Not all of them, but some of them said that.

2153
01:32:57.96 --> 01:32:59.96
Nonetheless, I'm saying there's a lot of values.

2154
01:32:59.96 --> 01:33:02.96
You did some value if you've never done you used to before.

2155
01:33:02.96 --> 01:33:03.96
Never.

2156
01:33:03.96 --> 01:33:04.96
Yeah.

2157
01:33:04.96 --> 01:33:04.96
Go.

2158
01:33:04.96 --> 01:33:05.96
OriginMain.com.

2159
01:33:05.96 --> 01:33:05.96
Check it out.

2160
01:33:05.96 --> 01:33:06.96
See if it's for you.

2161
01:33:06.96 --> 01:33:07.96
It's for you.

2162
01:33:07.96 --> 01:33:11.96
But you want to make sure and check on that one.

2163
01:33:11.96 --> 01:33:13.96
It's a good one.

2164
01:33:13.96 --> 01:33:15.96
Also, joc was a store.

2165
01:33:15.96 --> 01:33:16.96
It's called jocostor.

2166
01:33:16.96 --> 01:33:19.96
Go to jocostor.com.

2167
01:33:19.96 --> 01:33:24.96
So jocostor is where you can get shirts, t-shirts.

2168
01:33:24.96 --> 01:33:26.96
This one equals for you.

2169
01:33:26.96 --> 01:33:27.96
Get after it.

2170
01:33:27.96 --> 01:33:28.96
Sure.

2171
01:33:28.96 --> 01:33:30.96
With jocles big head on it.

2172
01:33:30.96 --> 01:33:31.96
This is good.

2173
01:33:31.96 --> 01:33:34.96
Just for those days that you're powering through some adversity.

2174
01:33:34.96 --> 01:33:35.96
Whatever.

2175
01:33:35.96 --> 01:33:37.96
Got joclery right on your shirt.

2176
01:33:37.96 --> 01:33:38.96
Oh, good.

2177
01:33:38.96 --> 01:33:42.96
Rashgarts, hoodies, patches.

2178
01:33:42.96 --> 01:33:45.96
Beenies.

2179
01:33:45.96 --> 01:33:49.96
Are either on there or they're like literally on the way.

2180
01:33:49.96 --> 01:33:51.96
The wheels are your motion, man.

2181
01:33:51.96 --> 01:33:52.96
Check.

2182
01:33:52.96 --> 01:33:53.96
I can't stop it.

2183
01:33:53.96 --> 01:33:54.96
Can't stop it.

2184
01:33:54.96 --> 01:33:55.96
Right, no.

2185
01:33:55.96 --> 01:33:56.96
A lot of cool stuff on there.

2186
01:33:56.96 --> 01:33:57.96
Stickers, some decals on there.

2187
01:33:57.96 --> 01:33:58.96
It's good.

2188
01:33:58.96 --> 01:33:59.96
Anyway, you don't have to get something.

2189
01:33:59.96 --> 01:34:00.96
But go on there.

2190
01:34:00.96 --> 01:34:01.96
Check it out.

2191
01:34:01.96 --> 01:34:02.96
If you like something, get something.

2192
01:34:02.96 --> 01:34:03.96
Really good way to support.

2193
01:34:03.96 --> 01:34:07.96
Also, for workout gear equipment.

2194
01:34:07.96 --> 01:34:13.96
You want to introduce some variety in movements in your workout.

2195
01:34:13.96 --> 01:34:15.96
Good place to go.

2196
01:34:15.96 --> 01:34:17.96
kettlebells, battle ropes, maces.

2197
01:34:17.96 --> 01:34:20.96
Go to on it.com slash jockel.

2198
01:34:20.96 --> 01:34:24.96
I once said, well, actually more than once said that.

2199
01:34:24.96 --> 01:34:26.96
Jockel's workouts are boring.

2200
01:34:26.96 --> 01:34:27.96
They're not.

2201
01:34:27.96 --> 01:34:28.96
I get it.

2202
01:34:28.96 --> 01:34:29.96
They're not boring.

2203
01:34:29.96 --> 01:34:31.96
I retract that statement.

2204
01:34:31.96 --> 01:34:32.96
They're not boring.

2205
01:34:32.96 --> 01:34:39.96
But if you run the risk of gear workouts being boring, just get some new equipment.

2206
01:34:39.96 --> 01:34:40.96
Actually, it's good.

2207
01:34:40.96 --> 01:34:41.96
Because you know when you get new equipment,

2208
01:34:41.96 --> 01:34:43.96
like it, even something that's supposed to jump rope.

2209
01:34:43.96 --> 01:34:46.96
Right, when you get it, kind of rejuvenates a little party.

2210
01:34:46.96 --> 01:34:48.96
You know, it's like when you get a new geek.

2211
01:34:48.96 --> 01:34:49.96
You want to go to practice more.

2212
01:34:49.96 --> 01:34:51.96
You know, you buy some new running shoes.

2213
01:34:51.96 --> 01:34:53.96
Like you kind of compelled to go running.

2214
01:34:53.96 --> 01:34:55.96
So you're basically still a five year old.

2215
01:34:55.96 --> 01:34:56.96
Whatever.

2216
01:34:56.96 --> 01:34:58.96
We kind of all are in a way.

2217
01:34:58.96 --> 01:35:00.96
And if you go to on it.

2218
01:35:00.96 --> 01:35:03.96
You get some new fitness gear.

2219
01:35:03.96 --> 01:35:05.96
It'll introduce a little variety to your workout.

2220
01:35:05.96 --> 01:35:09.96
Different gear, different movement, different workout.

2221
01:35:09.96 --> 01:35:11.96
Keep it on the path even more.

2222
01:35:11.96 --> 01:35:12.96
And make it interesting.

2223
01:35:12.96 --> 01:35:13.96
Maybe fun, man.

2224
01:35:13.96 --> 01:35:14.96
I think it's my opinion.

2225
01:35:14.96 --> 01:35:15.96
Anyway, on it.

2226
01:35:15.96 --> 01:35:16.96
I'm slash jockel.

2227
01:35:16.96 --> 01:35:17.96
Good spot.

2228
01:35:17.96 --> 01:35:18.96
Good way to support.

2229
01:35:18.96 --> 01:35:22.96
Also, when you're buying any of the books that we review on this podcast.

2230
01:35:22.96 --> 01:35:23.96
Don't worry.

2231
01:35:23.96 --> 01:35:25.96
I organized them on our website.

2232
01:35:25.96 --> 01:35:27.96
Talk about gas.com in the book section.

2233
01:35:27.96 --> 01:35:28.96
Just click through there.

2234
01:35:28.96 --> 01:35:30.96
Get the books through there.

2235
01:35:30.96 --> 01:35:31.96
And if you're doing any other shopping.

2236
01:35:31.96 --> 01:35:32.96
Hey, carry on.

2237
01:35:32.96 --> 01:35:33.96
Do you shopping?

2238
01:35:33.96 --> 01:35:34.96
Good way to support.

2239
01:35:34.96 --> 01:35:36.96
Also, subscribe to the podcast.

2240
01:35:36.96 --> 01:35:40.96
If you haven't already on iTunes, Stitcher, Google Play.

2241
01:35:40.96 --> 01:35:43.96
And any podcast app that you might use.

2242
01:35:43.96 --> 01:35:45.96
Not a new app, by the way.

2243
01:35:45.96 --> 01:35:46.96
Doing podcasts.

2244
01:35:46.96 --> 01:35:47.96
Yeah, subscribe.

2245
01:35:47.96 --> 01:35:48.96
Good way to support.

2246
01:35:48.96 --> 01:35:49.96
Also, we have a YouTube channel.

2247
01:35:49.96 --> 01:35:53.96
If you are interested in the video version of this podcast.

2248
01:35:53.96 --> 01:35:55.96
Subscribe to YouTube channel.

2249
01:35:55.96 --> 01:35:59.96
There's some excerpts on there along with the video version.

2250
01:35:59.96 --> 01:36:02.96
And enhanced excerpts.

2251
01:36:02.96 --> 01:36:03.96
Just good.

2252
01:36:03.96 --> 01:36:06.96
Do you live with a message with some cool music or something?

2253
01:36:06.96 --> 01:36:08.96
Anyway, shareable stuff.

2254
01:36:08.96 --> 01:36:11.96
Like so, you don't have to share a two, three hour podcast with someone.

2255
01:36:11.96 --> 01:36:14.96
And then, you know, when you get something in your message or inbox or whatever.

2256
01:36:14.96 --> 01:36:15.96
And it's two hours long.

2257
01:36:15.96 --> 01:36:17.96
And I'm watching it straight up.

2258
01:36:17.96 --> 01:36:20.96
In fact, I would say even right when you press play.

2259
01:36:20.96 --> 01:36:23.96
Before you even get to like five seconds in, you check.

2260
01:36:23.96 --> 01:36:24.96
See how long it is.

2261
01:36:24.96 --> 01:36:25.96
I think that's a normal protocol.

2262
01:36:25.96 --> 01:36:26.96
That is a normal protocol.

2263
01:36:26.96 --> 01:36:28.96
You see two hours you're clicking right out of there.

2264
01:36:28.96 --> 01:36:29.96
The friends, what it is.

2265
01:36:29.96 --> 01:36:30.96
Depend on what it is and depends on.

2266
01:36:30.96 --> 01:36:35.96
But there's not too often that you just got a two hour block from sitting the sit in the side.

2267
01:36:35.96 --> 01:36:36.96
Right.

2268
01:36:36.96 --> 01:36:37.96
Randomly somebody sent me a video.

2269
01:36:37.96 --> 01:36:38.96
Yeah.

2270
01:36:38.96 --> 01:36:39.96
I'll watch right now.

2271
01:36:39.96 --> 01:36:40.96
Yeah, that's not happening.

2272
01:36:40.96 --> 01:36:41.96
Yeah, typically doesn't happen like that.

2273
01:36:41.96 --> 01:36:43.96
But three minutes, four minutes.

2274
01:36:43.96 --> 01:36:44.96
Yeah.

2275
01:36:44.96 --> 01:36:47.96
And you might share it with your, you know, your friend.

2276
01:36:47.96 --> 01:36:49.96
Yeah, so subscribe YouTube channel.

2277

01:36:51.96 --> 01:36:52.96
Also.

2279
01:36:52.96 --> 01:36:54.96
Psychological warfare.

2280
01:36:54.96 --> 01:36:55.96
You know what that is?

2281
01:36:55.96 --> 01:36:56.96
This is what it is.

2282
01:36:56.96 --> 01:36:59.96
It's an album with tracks on this album.

2283
01:36:59.96 --> 01:37:00.96
Not music tracks.

2284
01:37:00.96 --> 01:37:01.96
It's jockel tracks.

2285
01:37:01.96 --> 01:37:06.96
And these tracks each track is designated engineered.

2286
01:37:06.96 --> 01:37:07.96
If you will.

2287
01:37:07.96 --> 01:37:09.96
To help you me.

2288
01:37:09.96 --> 01:37:10.96
To help me.

2289
01:37:10.96 --> 01:37:11.96
It's what it is.

2290
01:37:11.96 --> 01:37:13.96
But it will help you.

2291
01:37:13.96 --> 01:37:17.96
Get past little moments of weakness that you might encounter.

2292
01:37:17.96 --> 01:37:19.96
I'm not saying everyone's going to encounter it.

2293
01:37:19.96 --> 01:37:21.96
Everyone probably will encounter it.

2294
01:37:21.96 --> 01:37:22.96
But that's not the point here.

2295
01:37:22.96 --> 01:37:25.96
Point is, if you do encounter it, you got something to help you.

2296
01:37:25.96 --> 01:37:26.96
You got jockel to help you.

2297
01:37:26.96 --> 01:37:28.96
That's a good deal.

2298
01:37:28.96 --> 01:37:31.96
You want to skip to work out or something like this.

2299
01:37:31.96 --> 01:37:32.96
You don't feel like working out.

2300
01:37:32.96 --> 01:37:33.96
That's really what it is.

2301
01:37:33.96 --> 01:37:35.96
You don't feel like working out.

2302
01:37:35.96 --> 01:37:39.96
The comfort of not working out is distracting you is what it is.

2303
01:37:39.96 --> 01:37:45.96
But it seems more appealing than the discomfort of working out.

2304
01:37:45.96 --> 01:37:47.96
So what it is.

2305
01:37:47.96 --> 01:37:50.96
And then you listen to a track.

2306
01:37:50.96 --> 01:37:51.96
There's a certain track for that.

2307
01:37:51.96 --> 01:37:54.96
Jocquie explains to you why you shouldn't miss the workout.

2308
01:37:54.96 --> 01:37:55.96
Boom.

2309
01:37:55.96 --> 01:37:56.96
Part of the workout you're good.

2310
01:37:56.96 --> 01:37:58.96
And for every little weakness that you might come across is a track for it.

2311
01:37:58.96 --> 01:37:59.96
It's all good.

2312
01:37:59.96 --> 01:38:00.96
Just check it out.

2313
01:38:00.96 --> 01:38:03.96
And think like dang is that one of my weaknesses is boom.

2314
01:38:03.96 --> 01:38:04.96
Just get it.

2315
01:38:04.96 --> 01:38:05.96
You're good to go.

2316
01:38:05.96 --> 01:38:08.96
100% success rate in my experience.

2317
01:38:08.96 --> 01:38:09.96
Cool.

2318
01:38:09.96 --> 01:38:15.96
Also you can get jocquie-t, which I'm not even saying anything else about it because I don't have to.

2319
01:38:15.96 --> 01:38:18.96
Because this is a drink that guarantees in 8,000 pound deadlift.

2320
01:38:18.96 --> 01:38:19.96
And so what else?

2321
01:38:19.96 --> 01:38:21.96
What else could I say?

2322
01:38:21.96 --> 01:38:24.96
Regardless of age, everyone should know.

2323
01:38:24.96 --> 01:38:25.96
And you should be careful with that.

2324
01:38:25.96 --> 01:38:31.96
Because my 8-year-old daughter, she drinks from jocquie-t, 8,000 pounds.

2325
01:38:31.96 --> 01:38:32.96
DL.

2326
01:38:32.96 --> 01:38:34.96
Get something.

2327
01:38:34.96 --> 01:38:35.96
All right, books.

2328
01:38:35.96 --> 01:38:36.96
Way the warrior kid.

2329
01:38:36.96 --> 01:38:39.96
You probably already read the first way the warrior kid book.

2330
01:38:39.96 --> 01:38:41.96
If you haven't, you can get that right now.

2331
01:38:41.96 --> 01:38:46.96
You can also get way the warrior kid too.

2332
01:38:46.96 --> 01:38:48.96
Which you have not read yet.

2333
01:38:48.96 --> 01:38:49.96
It's called the Marks Mission.

2334
01:38:49.96 --> 01:38:52.96
You haven't read yet because it comes out April 24th.

2335
01:38:52.96 --> 01:38:54.96
It has more lessons.

2336
01:38:54.96 --> 01:38:55.96
Life lessons.

2337
01:38:55.96 --> 01:38:57.96
How to be a better human being.

2338
01:38:57.96 --> 01:38:59.96
How's that for a good subtitle?

2339
01:38:59.96 --> 01:39:02.96
How to be a better human being.

2340
01:39:02.96 --> 01:39:05.96
By the way, my nephew, my actual nephew.

2341
01:39:05.96 --> 01:39:07.96
He likes book too.

2342
01:39:07.96 --> 01:39:08.96
Better.

2343
01:39:08.96 --> 01:39:09.96
He liked book one.

2344
01:39:09.96 --> 01:39:10.96
He likes book too.

2345
01:39:10.96 --> 01:39:11.96
Better.

2346
01:39:11.96 --> 01:39:12.96
Judge for yourself.

2347
01:39:12.96 --> 01:39:14.96
Preorder now wherever books are sold.

2348
01:39:14.96 --> 01:39:19.96
So that it will be at your door on April 24th when it comes out.

2349
01:39:19.96 --> 01:39:22.96
And I'll top of that when you buy this book.

2350
01:39:22.96 --> 01:39:25.96
You're helping another kid see this book.

2351
01:39:25.96 --> 01:39:30.96
If that makes sense, like when you buy this book, someone else is going to see it.

2352
01:39:30.96 --> 01:39:32.96
It's going to elevate it.

2353
01:39:32.96 --> 01:39:33.96
And other people are going to see it.

2354
01:39:33.96 --> 01:39:35.96
We're trying to spread the word.

2355
01:39:35.96 --> 01:39:39.96
So the more we sell out of the gate, the more kids are going to hear about this book and the first book.

2356
01:39:39.96 --> 01:39:43.96
So get a copy for your kids, your neighbor kids, your classroom at school.

Which is what you should do.

2374
01:40:20.96 --> 01:40:22.96
What we should all do.

2375
01:40:22.96 --> 01:40:24.96
How do you do it though.

2376
01:40:24.96 --> 01:40:25.96
That's the question.

2377
01:40:25.96 --> 01:40:26.96
And the answer is in the field manual.

2378
01:40:26.96 --> 01:40:27.96
This doesn't go to freedom.

2379
01:40:27.96 --> 01:40:28.96
Field manual.

2380
01:40:28.96 --> 01:40:30.96

Combat leadership applied to the battlefield.

2387
01:40:40.96 --> 01:40:45.76
Amazon best seller number one why?

2388
01:40:45.76 --> 01:40:47.92
Cause it works.

01:40:47.92 --> 01:40:48.92
Read it.

2390
01:40:48.92 --> 01:40:53.92
And right now you can also order the follow on book to extreme ownership.

2391
01:40:53.92 --> 01:40:55.72
It's called the dichotomy of leadership.

2392
01:40:55.72 --> 01:40:58.40
You heard me talk a little bit about dichotomy today.

2393
01:40:58.40 --> 01:41:05.40
And in this book, Lafin I go into the granular principles and examples from the battlefield

2394
01:41:05.40 --> 01:41:10.52
and from business that will make you a better leader and a better person.

2395
01:41:10.52 --> 01:41:12.56
All those little scenarios we talked about today.

01:41:12.56 --> 01:41:16.08
If you read them and understand them, you'll be ready for you when you get punched in

So pre-error that book now or you're going to have to wait.

2399
01:41:22.16 --> 01:41:23.16
That's what happens.

2400
01:41:23.16 --> 01:41:28.40
If you don't pre-order, the book comes out and you don't get your copy.

2401
01:41:28.40 --> 01:41:29.40
Cause you hesitate.

2402

2438
01:43:51.64 --> 01:43:58.64
watching yourself, observing yourself, looking to see what you can do better and where

2439
01:43:58.64 --> 01:44:09.36
you can be better so that you can become better, keep yourself in check, hold the line

2440
01:44:09.36 --> 01:44:11.92
and get after it.

2441
01:44:11.92 --> 01:44:34.68
