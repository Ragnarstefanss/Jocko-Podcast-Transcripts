uh and again um I'm proud of that working group proud of Pete and Stan uh and uh the other guys a grin because I didn't like I said I didn't want to start going down his road if somebody was gonna you know throw out you know dozens of man years of work and planning to uh uh to toss it out so that was uh that and in combination with uh the uh the the SWICK NEC uh work the the two things that uh that I figured were probably the uh you know best accomplishments that uh uh that I uh that I ever had let me have one more thing you talked earlier about uh working with the uh uh the physical therapists and so on uh you need to uh to go back and uh thank uh uh I believe it was Pete Tony's uh who who started that uh you know bring it in those uh those physical therapists uh to work with the uh with the uh with the with the team guys uh Uh, um uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh uh, uh uh uh, uh. Uh, I missed a particular, uh, the operation, but, uh, grant, uh, grant Telfer squad had a, uh, had a phenomenal app, uh, you know, based on some intelligence that we generated, uh, and again, uh, you know, jackshults, uh, uh, uh, uh, would, uh, would go off, uh, you know, uh, checking with, uh, the PRUs, the, uh, the advisors, and, you know, looking for, you know, bits and pieces of intelligence, and, uh, one of the, uh, uh, one of the clues that they came up with was a, uh, a weapon storage facility, uh, not too far from, uh, from where Salt Anchor was located down there in the, uh, Nam Can Province. So, as their son goes through training, uh, I was, you know, particularly careful to make sure that, uh, that I did not single, uh, you know, him out, but, uh, I was, it was also, uh, you know, attentive to the fact that, you know, sometimes, uh, the son of a, we call him legacy is going through training, uh, just like they did and what was that, uh, was that movie, uh, uh, animal house, uh, you know, legacies, uh, but, uh, we, we wanted to make sure that, uh, you know, somebody's father had been, uh, jackass of the week to one of the, uh, the instructors, that that didn't carry over and take his sons attempt to get through training. Uh, we, uh, you know, and, uh, unfortunately, uh, there was not much of a debrief, uh, you know, we were all there, and, uh, we all there have been two, I think, except Marcus, Marcus said, uh, Marcus went, well, I don't know what his, uh, his, uh, his, his, he's back process was, but, uh, the rest of us were there, and, uh, and, uh, been two, he third, uh, field surgical hospital, uh, together for a few days, but then, then we went different directions, uh, in the, uh, in the process, uh, uh, Jim Roland went one, one place I came back to San Diego. Anyway, uh, uh, the guys stood on me, uh, from the, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, it's all got punched for my feet and then the second and third rounds, you know, you start with one guy and what's called the bottom position and the other guy, his arms around the, around the rest of the, the top position. Uh, and sometimes, if you, if you, if you didn't have something to work with, uh, you know, it might be every, every, every third day, might be every fourth day, uh, but, uh, oh boy, uh, we had a, uh, we had a, uh, a little sign hanging on the, uh, on the, uh, on the, uh, on the outside of the Hootch, and I actually, uh, that, that, that, you know, where you draw the little lines and then a slash to a, you know, five, uh, those were the, uh, those were the, that was a, uh, telly, they, what we, of the, of the known K. I, uh, I, I really don't remember the, uh, the total number of options we did in that, uh, in that six months. yes all right here we go we still lifting weights or what well given the uh seven plus decades I've been on the face of the earth uh the uh you know you know a few and uh a few and far between I've uh I've actually uh just in the last five or six weeks uh started to uh to go back in the gym uh but uh it's something I'll never stop uh and and the reason for it is you know at uh it's 74 years of age I don't have to hire somebody to cut my lawn I can still go out there I can do it uh and I've got I've got my people working in trailers in trailers and uh long story short because it's the way things work we got that money we got an accelerated military construction program that you know clearly wasn't done by the time I uh I left command but that was that became one of the top priorities for the so-com uh so-com milk on budget to uh to get us some buildings and I'll go one step further uh you know this afternoon I'm getting a chance to go down and uh and uh and uh and view uh uh the new uh new facilities for uh for seal team one that whole Naval Special Warfare complex down there is billions of dollars more importantly that says that that billion dollar figure was high enough in the priority list to get funded that says that so-com and the United States Navy and the Department of Defense recognized the commitment required to retain the capability that Naval Special Warfare provides to our military readiness they understand that and they're funding it it's not just a bunch of new buildings it says so much more than that and I will also say that at one point in time when I was looking for the uh for the next uh you know command uh well the force master chief for naval special warfare it came down to Kelly and a uh and and tried and winner uh so those are the last two guys standing uh but uh he was a he was quite a guy so establishment of the uh uh the SWIC uh SWIC community was something that was uh uh just uh just outstanding and it's now it's a rate and everything and guys going that's the career they can go and they have their whole career and special special boat team and one of the no we were still in our if you will early years with special operations command we were still in our early years of somewhat of a divorce from the Navy if you will because you know my I had had two two people I reported to you know one was a joint service commander army Navy Air Force or Marine down there in Tampa and the other was a code up on the on the op-nav staff you know ultimately of course to the C&O but the the money was there's there's something called a golden roll he what's got the gold rules and the the money at that time was from socom and that's where you know the vast majority of my my attention went but going back to the to the opportunities there were so many things so many things going on in the in the world and and specifically within our community there is a captain by the name of Todd Visi he was not a captain at the time but Todd was a station down at Navy Military Personnel Command uh I believe that was after they had uh it was after they had uh shifted down to uh the Memphis and what Todd did was he carried the water for our efforts to create the SWIC community you know when I uh when I took over a CO special boat unit 13 we had fleet sailors coming to drive these small boats the engines the uh you know quote main propulsion engines of a uh uh 65 foot Mark III patrol boat where a Detroit V Detroit diesel 8B 713 and uh I knew I knew right then it was going to be uh you know quite a quite a deal uh because of the work I was doing with uh essay I see I had the opportunity to sit in on a briefing that was uh given by the chief and naval operations at the time and uh he had been with the president just a few days before and as he recounted his uh experience with the uh with the president you could have heard a pin drop in the room uh given the uh the commitment uh and the uh will to fix that We had, uh, we had deployed in, uh, in August of 70, and, uh, we were, you know, scheduled to come back to, uh, the, uh, beginning of February, 71, and, uh, and, uh, and my squad had, uh, you know, started, uh, you know, clean in the gear and prepare and gear to pack it up and, uh, and send it home. Uh, we did things like, uh, going out in, uh, sand pans, but rolling a night looking for the, uh, for the V.C. tax collectors, uh, you're trying to hit up the, uh, the locals, uh, we'd sit on, uh, sit on, uh, you know, reverse side ambushes, uh, you know, looking for these guys. but well look we we got a bunch of stories out of you today like I said I know you're gonna go um you got any closing thoughts you want to say uh I had a great 30 years a lot of good guys and I'll tell you one one important closing thought uh when I took over in 96 we were still deploying seal patterns the same way I walked out the door in 1970 26 years a lot of things have changed in those 26 years uh Captain Pete Tony's in Stan Demit uh both guys who'd been group commanders on the east coast had come in and had uh pitch day uh uh uh recommended change of how to do business uh and we were calling it the squadron deployment If you look at Vietnam on a map, there's, it's kind of like a little tail kind of like the, uh, the keys and, uh, in Florida, well, there's a little tail down there and, uh, the very bottom part of, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, of Vietnam and we were on the, uh, we're on some called the Coulon River down there. And, uh, I was, you know, pretty much determined that I was going to go to a place called Portland State, uh, Portland had, uh, an, uh, an excellent, uh, you know, PT program, uh, you know, for, uh, teaching and, uh, they, uh, they also had a pretty good wrestling team at the time. Uh, and, uh, you know, one of them was a, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, a highly decorated, uh, seal chief by the name of, uh, Tommy Hatchett. but we had the uh we had the core of uh of what we were looking at we were already already looking at uh you know different uh team deployments and how we were gonna change that all so we would have one team uh with uh boat guys intelligent support we just support that kind of thing uh deploying forward and uh as I as I stop and and look today it looks a whole lot different than uh than what what walked out the door finally under Eric Olson A name was John Sanrico, uh, you know, stronger than a law allowed, uh, but, uh, with, with a name like, Sanrico, his nickname was dizzy, uh, but that John, uh, John could, uh, could quote only bench press about three and a quarter, three, thirty five and he was always complaining that listen, this is 198 pounder, you know, five foot eight, uh, 198 pounder, played full back, uh, and he's benching 335 pounds, you know, I mean, that's something to write home about. Oh, absolutely, uh, the SPI program, uh, when I went through it was, uh, run by, uh, guys like, uh, Mesh Chief, Own Yui, uh, and, uh, you know, Uncle Own, uh, Mesh Chief Own Yui was a, uh, was a fantastic individual. so you get a uh an engine from the fleet who's never seen your engine uh you get a gunners made from his fleet who's looking for the five inch gun uh you get a uh you get a uh communications or electronic technician who's looking for uh you know CIC it ain't there uh and old by the way uh you need to learn about the M60 the prick 77 uh you you name it that they've never seen before in their life so we'd get these guys for two or three years they learn a lot about names special warfare them boom One, uh, because nobody was killed, uh, with that number of bad guys, uh, and without the, uh, the, the, the flying and dedication of, uh, how three, uh, Carl Nelson in particular and, uh, and his, uh, you know, his door gunners, uh, I'm not here to have the conversation. I I talked to as many folks as I could on each coast and uh I remember you know saying the focus and guys you know this is this is hard for me because so much my time is going to be directed upward you know whether it's you know budget personnel matters that uh that I'm going to have to work with so common the uh and in the navy uh when I walked in to command at uh at Naval Special Warfare there was a relatively new building that didn't come close to accommodating the staff at Naval Special Warfare Command when I walked in six eight ten maybe use twenty trailers surrounding the building you know yeah do you got a gym at your house uh I've got a few hundred pounds so here you go when I went down to El Salvador I went on a company for a year and uh with that I was able to send uh uh a thousand pounds or 1100 pounds of uh a personal gear 700 pounds of weightlifting equipment I had I had squat racks of bench and at least 500 pounds of uh pounds of weights in my own room in my own uh in my own building when I uh there was a the the guy We had a, uh, we had a guy on the, uh, uh, on the, uh, on the football team, uh, name is Ray played, uh, and, uh, so I'm another, you know, 50 year reunion a few years ago and, uh, he's doing well. So, I get to Villanova and, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, what was back up a little bit more to, you know, staying in, uh, in school. I'm now the, uh, the skipper of, of butts and, uh, uh, Ray is, uh, is the admiral in charge of, uh, uh, Naval Special Warfare Command and, uh, Ray and his wife Kathy are living across the street on the amphib base and, uh, Ray's son is going through seal training. So, uh, and it was only X number of weeks, uh, you know, a couple of months, uh, because we had to, you know, finish up, uh, we're enough time to give, give guys a, uh, a week or 10 days off before, uh, deployin, just to, you know, take care of business. And the three star, Davy type, who was in charge of, of, of, you know, midies for, you know, navy, midies for, he, I didn't realize it, but he was in the talk the whole time, you know, listening, you know, I'm sure the, the was out was based in Bahrain, we're out there in the middle of the Persian Gulf, and the, the, the, the album was there, you just listen and you know, when I, when I called it off, when I saw what it was, you know, and when in, so I came, I came, a sure, you know, week 10 days later in the, you know, six, you know, up so caused me over and he says, good job, but, you know, we had, we had American lives on the line, we had international lives on the line, could have been a mining operation, I just did not know, and I was not sure that this was a minor, a mining vessel, so I said, nope, what I doing at, what were your major lessons learned, what was a good takeaway from being the mining officer tilting one? and I are supporting a uh a wildlife museum in uh in Virginia Beach and uh other than that where I were pretty much uh pretty much retired but uh anybody wants to uh an old far within a pinion uh you know give me a call Complete, uh, I mean, when you look at the, uh, the mission focus at the, the seal platoons have today, uh, the breadth of, uh, the breadth of the, uh, the type of missions they can get, you know, like, uh, you know, introduction at sea, taking down a ship at sea. We'd started that process in my squad and grant, uh, grant wanted to do one more operation and, uh, since it was grant, uh, with, whether, whatever information he had, I wasn't paying attention to it, uh, uh, uh, uh, I was working with my guys getting ready to, getting ready to come home. We were, we were there to, uh, to look for, uh, for V.C., uh, you know, V.C. tax collectors, uh, you know, anybody, uh, infiltrating that, uh, that part of the world, gather the intelligence, try to find out who these folks were, where they were, and go after them. Uh, I, Jesus, I want to say, uh, he, he was a, uh, he was a, uh, he was a weight man that is he threw, uh, uh, through the, uh, hammer or something like that. and you know here we are this you know you know sitting right next to the uh uh to those uh those gorgus multi million dollar condominiums they're looking down on a trailer park I'm sure they love that so the first budget cycle that I went into with uh with the uh forced dark commander down there in the in Tampa and so what I did at that point in time is I sat down with uh well our most myth was still uh still on active duty uh uh uh uh uh Admiral Eric Olson and a couple of other folks But, uh, you know, I had, uh, I had a few bucks and, uh, you know, managed to waste it, uh, but I also, uh, you know, was able to distribute a few bucks to some of the other guys in the Patuna because we had no money. But while we were up there, uh, you know, grant and, uh, the other guys found this, uh, you know, one of the largest, uh, ammo caches, uh, you know, VC ammo caches, located in the, in the, in the war. They come back to base and, uh, they take Marcus off the, uh, the plane, our corpsman, uh, doc Harris, Tom Harris, who's on his deathbed, uh, Tom Harris takes, uh, Marcus down to, uh, we had a, uh, calling a sick bay. And I, so I'll tell you my, uh, my, uh, my, uh, how they, uh, my, uh, um, uh, uh, well. I caught, you can get out of your from behind and just, uh, you know, wrap them up in a nice neat baggage and, uh, fetched Chief you, uh, uh, kind of blast with that, but, uh, you know, but lesson learned, you know, there, there we go. but they wanted to instead of having to learn all this uh on the job let's let's put it together and teach them about this special warfare stuff that they're now in the middle of so we started out the first class with a three and a half week class and when we laid it out as a three and a half week class they were concerned that that was too much time uh you know to have these guys away from the team now of course because they were away from the team that means that they had a voter to that was not manned so you know understand that the finish up with the class the skippers were so charged that the next class was a five week class that they they just like and that all grew so I go from CO of special boat units 13 with the problem trying to solve part of it as a as a commanding officer of the center and now when I get to the uh to be the commander of naval special warfare I was able to convince the Navy to create the SWIC any sea and that was just uh What we had was something called C-flow, and C-flow was a series of barges last together in the, uh, in the river, uh, with the attachments of, uh, you know, patrol boats operating from there and seal Patoons operating from, uh, from the, uh, from the, uh, from the barges. so it's a quite impressed program and again an opportunity to learn you know so much about the Alaska natives it just uh great opportunity their base is uncodiac island where our training facility is their corporate headquarters or real business offices or our anchorage so I get to start meeting a number of the you know the natives you know all the board members were were were natives and many of them had spent a lot of time on uncodiac where we have our training facility and then they learned that I'm a retired seal and they told me about the time those goddam seals you know walked across these uh you know special you know sacred That's when, you know, that's when the guy who did so was, uh, and his, uh, you know, ROTC test, uh, you know, got his, I got his brain back together and that's the first time I learned the power of the, uh, of the pen and independent thinking of the Navy. So, uh, Ray, uh, you know, we have, we have the breakout and, uh, you know, some people, the breakout includes, uh, uh, busting the students out of the barracks, giving them all sorts of confusing directions and things to do. Uh, but, uh, I lifted a 242 and, uh, uh, I had, uh, you know, I had, you know, a good strong four 15 bench press. They give me my first, uh, uh, issue of equipment and they tell me that the, uh, the class was in pre-training at the time is, uh, is over, uh, here at the, at the, at the ocean front, go over there and tell them who you are and, uh, that you're joining the class. We were coming in, and, uh, we, uh, we landed, and we went up a rice paddy over one and up the next and, uh, we would, as I say, taking fire almost immediately, but we went up that, uh, third section of rice paddy, uh, we were just, uh, we just didn't kill them. Uh, uh, Randy, Randy Scherd and had been, uh, seriously wounded, uh, he, uh, he, he basically lost his elbow, uh, as a result of the wounded he got on, on one of my squad operations. and he said well well who's gonna pay for that you know the uh I said we are naval special warfare in the US special operations command he said sold and that's that's how we uh that's that's that's the third biggest thing that I feel that uh that I can uh yeah hang my hat on in my career you know you're getting getting people the finally understand if you want to do something in stride for the M-fib's you're probably gonna launch that that reconnaissance from somewhere else So I, I, as I had caught up to the class, uh, this, uh, great big, uh, instructor, uh, by an amateur tracks, bear tracks, uh, Williams, uh, looks over the class and he sees me as the last man in the formation. And, uh, we had a, uh, we had 190, another 198 pounder, uh, at the, at the school and, uh, Jim Repucci was, uh, was also ranked nationally and, uh, he was the number two 190 college leftier. Uh, and, uh, we, uh, you know, it wasn't too, you know, to grant, uh, and I don't want to say in defense, but, you know, in grants thought process. Uh, so, uh, you know, the, uh, uh, going through, uh, going through training in the summer in Coronado was as hot as I'd ever been. And, you know, what's done when, uh, because of course, the, uh, the, the students, you know, learn too much about what's coming up next and, uh, and they can sort of, you know, get their minds, uh, get their minds around it. Uh, so they're holding a, uh, uh, a rally and they're, uh, blockading, uh, access to, uh, to the campus. Uh, I am a retired Catholic, uh, but I went through a Catholic grammar school and, uh, got to, uh, the high school was the first time I saw anything like, uh, like wrestling. And, uh, then he, uh, then he mentions in the summary that he provided for, uh, Captain Slatter, he, uh, he heard, you know, Tom, uh, Yelp a second time. And here's this, you know, 35 year old man, uh, you know, 16570 pounds, uh, you know, wrestling, you know, champion and his, uh, and his own right. So it, it's, uh, it's interesting to be able to have that conversation, uh, any, uh, any smart ice remarks that I might make about it, call it seal humor, uh, but, uh, you know, that's, that's what it is.
