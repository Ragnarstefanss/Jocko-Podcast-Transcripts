00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000
This is Jocco podcast number 148 with echo Charles and me, Jocco Willink. Good evening, echo. Good evening.

2
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:36.000
I'm 19. I'm 20 November 1950. Dear Mr. and Mrs. Richardson, I regret that I must confirm my recent telegram in which you were informed that your son, Master Sergeant William J. Richardson infantry, has been reported missing an action in Korea since two November 1950.

3
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:44.000
I know that added distress is caused by failure to receive any more information or details.

4
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Therefore, I wish to assure you that at any time additional information is received, it will be transmitted to you without delay.

5
00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:06.000
The term missing in action is used only to indicate that the whereabouts or status of an individual is not immediately known.

6
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
It is not intended to convey the impression that the case is closed.

7
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:26.000
I wish to emphasize that every effort is exerted continuously to clear up the status of our personnel. Under battle conditions, this is a difficult task as you must readily realize.

8
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Experiences shown that many persons reported missing an action are subsequently reported as returned to duty or being hospitalized for injuries.

9
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:47.000
In order to relieve financial worry on the part of the dependence of military personnel being carried in a missing in action status,

10
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Congress enacted legislation which continues the pay allowance and allotments of such persons until their status is definitely established.

11
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Permit me to extend to you my heartfelt sympathy during this period of uncertainty, sincerely yours Edward F. Whitsell, major general, US Army.

12
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:45.000
So obviously that is a letter from the government about a missing soldier, this missing soldier in this case is William Richardson and William Richardson or Bill Richardson, who was a part of that whole melee that unfolded in the beginning of the Korean war.

13
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:56.000
In the 8th Army, he was caught off from the rest of coalition forces and many of those that got caught off as that retreat took place.

14
00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Many Americans and South Koreans as well were captured, were killed or otherwise they were somehow lost or missing.

15
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:32.000
This guy, Bill Richardson was one of those men, one of those men that went missing and clearly from this letter his parents were notified about that and he wrote a book on these experiences that he went through the book is called Valese of death a memoir of the Korean war.

16
00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:41.000
He actually has that letter from the army to his parents inside the book which is a pretty shocking thing to see.

17
00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:48.000
And you know these days they with with the current way they notify they send people to your house.

18
00:03:48.000 --> 00:04:00.000
But I can't even imagine that the old days when you just get a telegram or a letter that shows up and says that your your son's been missing for three weeks or four weeks or whatever the case may be.

19
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:09.000
But this book, I definitely, there's the combat in this book is out of hand and you're going to see that pretty quick.

20
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:15.000
And like every other book that we review on here obviously I can't read the whole thing.

21
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:25.000
But definitely this book is worth getting Valese of death a memoir of the Korean war written by Colonel William or Bill Richardson.

22
00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:34.000
And it's a phenomenal book so with that let's dive right into it.

23
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:43.000
He lays out a little bit of his perspective writing the book here in the in the preface of the book and here we go.

24
00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
This is not a history of the Korean war.

25
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:52.000
It is a down dirty look at some of the soldiers who five years before had experienced combat in the second world war.

26
00:04:52.000 --> 00:05:02.000
It is the story of the men they would lead a new generation of courageous young soldiers in what would be the last true infantry war.

27
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:13.000
The heroes of this story are the young men of the third battalion, eight cavalry regiment and in particular the men of the weapons platoon of L company.

28
00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
Most of them died.

29
00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:30.000
The story is told through my own eyes. I've made a strong attempt to avoid adding to the story what others have said or what I have learned over the last 57 years.

30
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000
But there are few truths that are undeniable.

31
00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:47.000
Korea was a war that neither the country nor the military was ready for and we paid a high price for a lack of readiness.

32
00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.000
The disaster at U-Son written about in this book was caused by a lapse of leadership from the highest echelon down to the battalion level.

33
00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:59.000
Mistakes we paid for with the blood of the most heroic men.

34
00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
I have ever known.

35
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:09.000
And when we covered Chester Pillar he talked a lot about that about the lack of readiness.

36
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:15.000
And if you remember the Marine Corps throwing together battalions to try and get over there.

37
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
And that was the whole country that was doing this.

38
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:26.000
And in the beginning of this book he talks about he kind of introduces the characters that he was with.

39
00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
He talks about some of the training that they had been through.

40
00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:35.000
He was part of a squad that fired the 57 they called it, which is a recoil of rifle.

41
00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
The M-18.

42
00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.000
It's a 57 millimeter recoil of rifle.

43
00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
It basically looks like a bazooka kind of your traditional.

44
00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
If you're in your mind you picture the bazooka.

45
00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.000
That's sort of what it looks like.

46
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
And there's a bunch of different variations of the bazooka.

47
00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
And this is sort of one of them.

48
00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000
And in this point when we pick up the book he's kind of gone through that.

49
00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.000
And they actually are now heading on to California on their way to war.

50
00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:09.000
So you know he covers the kick off of the war and what that was like in him kind of getting back in the game.

51
00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
And here we go.

52
00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:16.000
They're heading to California to get on a ship to go to Korea for the war.

53
00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.000
Back to the book.

54
00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
There was a gravity to it.

55
00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
We were on the doorstep of war.

56
00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:26.000
We all knew it and wanted to be disciplined because when the bullet started.

57
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:31.000
The discipline could be the difference between life and death.

58
00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
That is indeed true.

59
00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.000
Continuing.

60
00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
The war in Korea had reached a crisis level.

61
00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
American and South Korean units were fighting for their lives.

62
00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:46.000
They'd been swept from the 38th parallel and quickly forced out of Seoul.

63
00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
The North Korean swept South towards Busan.

64
00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.000
A port on the eastern tip of the Korean peninsula.

65
00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:58.000
Now our troops were making their last stand along the Natong River in the west.

66
00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:04.000
And a line north of the Taegu reaching east to the sea of Japan.

67
00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:12.000
And they were heading on the US troop transport ship called the Pope, which had just been taken out of mobballs.

68
00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
If you don't know this, they take old ships.

69
00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
When they're not needed.

70
00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.000
They put them up.

71
00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
Well, they put them in a couple places around the country.

72
00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
But they put them up and they called it Mothballs.

73
00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
And then they just leave these big old ships sitting there.

74
00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:32.000
If they ever are needed again, they can pull them out and kind of get them up to speed.

75
00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.000
So that's what the Pope was.

76
00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
It was a vessel that was pulled out of Mothballs.

77
00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
And now it was getting ready to sail overseas.

78
00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
And these guys get on.

79
00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
And the head overseas.

80
00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
And then back to the book after eight days on board on board the ship.

81
00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
Words spread that we were getting close to Japan.

82
00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.000
We do another month of training before landing in Korea.

83
00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.000
We crowded along the rail looking at the shorelights in the distance.

84
00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:59.000
The water made the lights from the city look like stars.

85
00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
It's Yokohama and we're headed right for it.

86
00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
I heard a soldier say.

87
00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:09.000
Suddenly the ship started slowly turning to the starboard.

88
00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.000
And running south, parallel to the shore.

89
00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
I didn't think much of it.

90
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:21.000
But the next morning we were informed that we were going straight to Korea.

91
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.000
There you go.

92
00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000
That's the way the military works sometimes.

93
00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000
You're thinking to go train for an extra month and have a little bit more time to prepare for combat.

94
00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
And all of a sudden that time's gone.

95
00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.000
And you're going straight into the combat scenario.

96
00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:44.000
So that's why everyone out there in the military don't wait till tomorrow to train.

97
00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000
It's not going to come or it may not come.

98
00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
So they pull into this port and puisson.

99
00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
Back to the boat the smell was unbearable.

100
00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:59.000
The water around the docked docked puisson was black and slick with oil and sewage.

101
00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:03.000
Two docks up from where we were was a cattle holding area.

102
00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.000
And when they cleaned the pens they just hoseed everything into the water.

103
00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
The punching odor hit us as we approached the pier.

104
00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:17.000
Most of the guys stayed below out of the smell, but I stayed on the deck mesmerized by the port.

105
00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:22.000
The 8th Army had established a perimeter to hold off the Koreans people.

106
00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:28.000
The Korean people's army until enough troops could arrive and organize a counter offensive.

107
00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
Set up in August.

108
00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:36.000
The perimeter's western boundary was formed mostly by the Naktong River.

109
00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:41.000
The North Koreans crossed the Naktong River.

110
00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:50.000
And then he says, I know one thing, if you're defending a river and the enemy is on your side, you're in trouble.

111
00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:55.000
That evening after another dinner of sea rations, I got the section together.

112
00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.000
This is his little section of troops that he's running. He's in charge of.

113
00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
And here's what he tells him.

114
00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:08.000
Everyone in check is gear one more time. We're moving to an assembly area north of the Tegu first thing in the morning.

115
00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:14.000
And take a moment to write home. You never know when you'll get another chance.

116
00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:22.000
And that's one of those things that that can be predatory heavy statement when he's saying that.

117
00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
And I'll tell you when you're in that situation.

118
00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.000
If you're especially if you're young, at least in my situation.

119
00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000
If someone would've told me that when I was 19 years old, I would've been fired up.

120
00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000
And that's just the way it is.

121
00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:40.000
Yeah, I guess some people think it's crazy to think that way.

122
00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:50.000
But I'm telling you, there's a whole group of human beings in the world that they have a little genetic makeup that makes them want to go to war.

123
00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:55.000
And so when you get told, hey, you know, write your last letter home.

124
00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.000
You're actually pretty fired up about it.

125
00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
Again, I know that sounds completely crazy.

126
00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000
And even thing is he was a little bit older.

127
00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:11.000
So I think for him, he had more gravity for him than it did for his boys.

128
00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:18.000
The other thing is, I think it's hard for them to have recognized, even though they read it in news, like how bad it was.

129
00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
And we've heard this from other people too. We've heard this from other people.

130
00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
Like you always think it's not going to be you, right?

131
00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000
They're going to be me that gets killed. It's not going to be me.

132
00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:28.000
That's not going to happen to me.

133
00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
So you have that little thing in your brain too.

134
00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
We just think it won't happen to you.

135
00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
So you aren't that concerned about it.

136
00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:44.000
And the other thing is like, you know, you just got done with World War II, where all this heavy combat.

137
00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:45.000
And guess what?

138
00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
We were back to back World War Champions.

139
00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:48.000
Right?

140
00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
America was back to back World War Champions.

141
00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:55.000
So how we're going to get into a worse situation on this little random little Asian country,

142
00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000
Little peninsula, like this won't be a factor.

143
00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000
So you had to have that in your head a little bit. You had to do.

144
00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:06.000
I don't think they recognized how serious the situation was, even though they were saying it.

145
00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.000
My point is that even though you're getting told, hey, this is a dire situation.

146
00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.000
And we're holding up a perimeter to try and wait for more troops to arrive.

147
00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
So we can actually do a counter offensive.

148
00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
Even though you hear that, you're like, all right, let's know big deal.

149
00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.000
We'll handle it.

150
00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:25.000
In my mind, again, I'm trying to transpose a 19-year-old brain on this situation.

151
00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000
All right, go back to the book.

152
00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.000
The trains to take you left just after noon.

153
00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000
I heard a few cheers as the train picked up momentum.

154
00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.000
So there you go.

155
00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:36.000
I'm right.

156
00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:37.000
Right?

157
00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:38.000
The train is heading to combat.

158
00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:39.000
Where do the boys doing?

159
00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
They're cheering.

160
00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:46.000
The train lumbering down the track for a while and then stopped at a sighting.

161
00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:53.000
Word came back that we were near the assembly area, but had to make way for a hospital train, headed south.

162
00:13:53.000 --> 00:14:00.000
The train carrying the wounded stop for a few moments, and we could see the soldiers inside.

163
00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
I.V. bags hung next to litters.

164
00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:09.000
Men with bandaged arms, legs, and heads lined the cars.

165
00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:13.000
The few walking wounded stared out the windows.

166
00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:20.000
The wounded Americans had dark depressing eyes and a vacant stare.

167
00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:27.000
A few of our guys tried to pass them cigarettes and candy from the window, but they didn't react.

168
00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:32.000
They just stared into space.

169
00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000
So there's your reality check.

170
00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
That's what we're heading for.

171
00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
And that's a little wake-up call.

172
00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:44.000
They got out at the, there was cheers when the train rolled north again.

173
00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000
And they go from trains eventually.

174
00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:51.000
They get off trains and next up is they're getting into some troop transport trucks.

175
00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:52.000
And here we go back to the book.

176
00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:57.000
As the trucks rumbled forward, we can see American troops moving south down the road.

177
00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:01.000
They looked like ghosts, frail with torn and dirty uniforms.

178
00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.000
Their black eyes didn't even register as we passed.

179
00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000
They had the infantry men's thousand yard stare.

180
00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000
They were lost.

181
00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000
Gone.

182
00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000
We were operating under Lieutenant General Walton H.

183
00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:19.000
Walkers standing order to stand or die.

184
00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:26.000
Walker, the 8th Army commander, had issued the order in July before we derived.

185
00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:30.000
And here's the quote from General Walker.

186
00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000
We are fighting a battle against time.

187
00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:41.000
There will be no more retreating withdrawal or readjustment of the lines or any other term you choose.

188
00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000
There is no line behind us to which we can retreat.

189
00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000
There will be no Dunkirk.

190
00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.000
There will be no Baton.

191
00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:54.000
A retreat to Pusan would be one of the greatest butcharies in history.

192
00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000
We must fight until the end.

193
00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000
We will fight as a team.

194
00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:02.000
If some of us must die, we will die fighting together.

195
00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:10.000
I want everybody to understand we are going to hold this line.

196
00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:15.000
We are going to win.

197
00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000
Now that's a heavy statement.

198
00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:27.000
And if you know a little bit of the background about this, Walker General Walker was in World War I and World War II and now he's in Korea.

199
00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:34.000
And you had MacArthur at the time who was in Japan who was basically saying, hey look, I don't care.

200
00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:35.000
You can hold the line.

201
00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:36.000
You're going to hold the line.

202
00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:41.000
Even though Walker was thinking, hey, I need massive support.

203
00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.000
I don't know if we can pull this off.

204
00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.000
And the order came and he was like, okay.

205
00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:53.000
And you know what, I mean, I talk about this if you're getting that command, you can't come down and say,

206
00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:58.000
oh, MacArthur is telling us that we got a but I don't think we can do it. No, he's like, okay, that's what we're going to do our best to do.

207
00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:04.000
Now, as you actually study what unfolded, eventually he held it as long as he could and then he started to

208
00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000
tactically retreat to the best of his ability.

209
00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:10.000
And so he sort of compromised.

210
00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.000
He didn't just state it, didn't stand against slaughter.

211
00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:17.000
So he eventually made a more organized retreat that he could.

212
00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.000
But still, the eighth arm he was on the run, if you remember this time, this is when

213
00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:26.000
the Marines were trying to hold the line as well. So it was a very hard situation.

214
00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:31.000
Going back to the book, thick black smoke rose in a steady stream on the other side of the horizon.

215
00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:36.000
I could see only a few of the squat huts, but the valley and ridges had thick,

216
00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:40.000
scraggly bushes, which made it very difficult to see any movement.

217
00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:44.000
Suddenly, artillery shells and mortar rounds crashed down around us.

218
00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:48.000
We dove into ditches that line the road and waited for the barrage to end.

219
00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:52.000
I waved to my section and got them together before we moved out toward the outscore

220
00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.000
to the village.

221
00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:59.000
A smoky haze with a pungent smell of gunpowder hung over us as we started moving forward.

222
00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:04.000
I could feel my heart beating and my breath came quickly, almost like I was running.

223
00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.000
But it wasn't nerves.

224
00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000
It was adrenaline.

225
00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.000
My body was on fire, popping with energy.

226
00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:16.000
Back on the road, a North Korean machine gun to our right open fire.

227
00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:21.000
I could see tracer rounds in almost slow motion, dashing into the line of man ahead of me.

228
00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:26.000
The soldiers ducked and dove out of the way as the rounds bitten to the dirt around them.

229
00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.000
Time is a strange thing in combat.

230
00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:36.000
Sometimes it moves so fast that you cannot believe it and other times it is moving so slowly that you could scream.

231
00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:40.000
We dove into the dirt and pressed ourselves flat against the ground.

232
00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:48.000
Maca B and Maca B at this time is the company commander started moving the other potunes toward the guns while my section,

233
00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:51.000
part of the weapons platoon, provided supporting fire.

234
00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.000
So there you go. They set up a little cover move.

235
00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.000
This was real combat.

236
00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:59.000
All of my fears seemed so far away now.

237
00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:03.000
I didn't have time to worry about how I'd react.

238
00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.000
I just had to act.

239
00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:09.000
Turning back towards Walsh's gun, I yelled for him to get in position and start firing at the machine.

240
00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.000
Walsh nodded and started calling to his men.

241
00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:17.000
Like veterans they ignored the machine gun fire and got the gun up and got ready.

242
00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:22.000
Put some fire on that hill I shouted pointing toward the North Korean gunners with my hand.

243
00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:27.000
Walsh pointed out the machine gun position and go as the assistant gunner loaded around and

244
00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.000
Hall cited in the gun and fired.

245
00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.000
My section fired.

246
00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.000
It's first shot of the war.

247
00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:41.000
So a couple key things that I liked about this paragraph of, you know, he talks about time and the weird things that time

248
00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:42.000
does during combat.

249
00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:50.000
And that happens during any really stressful situation where you become a hyper sensitive to what's happening.

250
00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:54.000
And with the way it appears, the way it feels is that time is actually slowing down.

251
00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:58.000
I think the first time that I ever experienced that was in a car crash, not a bad car crash,

252
00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.000
but I was in a car crash.

253
00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.000
And it seemed like things were moving in slow motion and I wasn't driving.

254
00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.000
I was just a passenger, but I was, that's the first time I ever felt it.

255
00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:16.000
And then the other thing I see you can be expecting that, be expecting if you're going in a combat that you might have that slow motion.

256
00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:20.000
It's actually an awesome thing because you can feel like you can, I don't know,

257
00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:23.000
to me it didn't feel like I was moving slow.

258
00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:28.000
It always felt like things were moving slow and I could still, it gave me more time to react.

259
00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:32.000
It's like if you're doing Gigiitsu and you're opponent was moving slow motion.

260
00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:38.000
But even though you weren't even though you couldn't move faster than them, you could see it and react to it properly.

261
00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.000
Does that make sense?

262
00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:46.000
And then the other thing is if you notice the fear, he's saying that he didn't have time to be afraid,

263
00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:50.000
which is definitely something I felt where like once rounds are being shot, you're not thinking,

264
00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:54.000
oh, I'm going to get shot. You're thinking, okay, we need to get a mind, we need to peel right.

265
00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.000
We need to make a call as opposed to.

266
00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:00.000
And one of that that's based on in my opinion is training.

267
00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:04.000
And if you train properly, then you just react. That's just, that's just what happens.

268
00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:09.000
And this is why, and you heard me say this at the, at the masterminds talking about like from a self defense perspective.

269
00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:14.000
It's for females that are doing Gigiitsu for the first time I'm like, hey, if you've never done Gigiitsu before,

270
00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:20.000
you're about to see that this is about as intimate as a sport.

271
00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:25.000
Or, or this about as intimate as an activity, you can possibly engage in.

272
00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:34.000
Without actually taking it to the next level, right? Without actually having without being married to the other person, right?

273
00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:40.000
So, and that's the thing. If you get used to that, you get used to somebody grinding on,

274
00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:45.000
you get used to someone grabbing you and you want you get used to it, then you don't have to deal with that in the moment,

275
00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.000
because you are not dealing with it. You can just react.

276
00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:50.000
So it's the same thing here. These guys have trained really hard.

277
00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:54.000
And so now once this situation is unfolding, what they're doing is just reacting to it.

278
00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:59.000
As they should. They're not sitting there panicking and getting, getting to it.

279
00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:04.000
Not that everyone's going to be like that, because you will have some people that will immediately get that,

280
00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:08.000
that fighter flight, and they might roll into the flight scenario for getting down and hiding.

281
00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:14.000
And so you might have to deal with that a little bit, but be ready for any of those reactions.

282
00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:19.000
So now the first, once they get through this first big kind of firefight going on,

283
00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.000
now we're going back to the book. The guys were digging in.

284
00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:25.000
I told them to set up the guns, but we'd be covering our section with rifles that night.

285
00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:30.000
We were all wired after our first firefight, and it was good that we had something to do.

286
00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:34.000
I was happy to see that everybody was digging in with a sense of urgency.

287
00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:38.000
I was worried about our open flank to the right.

288
00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:43.000
I ordered the section to dig in some positions facing to the right, in case we had to occupy them.

289
00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:49.000
When we were done, I told my guys to eat and rest while they got with Walsh and Gray.

290
00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:54.000
The word is the North Koreans were attacking that night.

291
00:22:54.000 --> 00:23:03.000
So the most of the, you'll see throughout this book that the North Koreans and then eventually the Chinese,

292
00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:06.000
they do their attacks during the night. That's what they do. That's how they roll.

293
00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:10.000
They're, they're, if you remember, even T Fred Harvey was talking about,

294
00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:13.000
and when he was doing the island happening, op and campaign,

295
00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:17.000
they was Americans moving in the day, and then at night, the Japanese would attack.

296
00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:21.000
So similar situation here. Now it's actually the opposite against the enemy,

297
00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:25.000
because we have, you know, we have night vision capability, so we have a huge advantage at night.

298
00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:29.000
So that's when we normally work in. And, and in the SEAL teams, that's the way,

299
00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:32.000
that's the way we always worked. We always worked at night.

300
00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:35.000
Now when we got to Ramadhi, you know, it was a lot of daytime fighting.

301
00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:39.000
We had to fight in the day, but the preferred thing is to fight at night.

302
00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:41.000
And that goes back to the seals in Vietnam.

303
00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:46.000
And if you remember, Roger Hayden, I think it was Roger Hayden,

304
00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:50.000
was saying when they were going out at night, no one else was going out at night.

305
00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:54.000
It was just like seals who go out at night, but other than that, it was only the vehicle

306
00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:57.000
that were going out at night and the NVA.

307
00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:01.000
But friendly forces just seals. And I know there's other, there's other ones,

308
00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:04.000
but he was saying early on, it was them.

309
00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:08.000
So now the attack comes. Here we go back to the book.

310
00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:11.000
The attack started with a gutterl scream.

311
00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:17.000
The North Koreans came out of the brush in waves. We could see them moving towards us like shadows.

312
00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:20.000
Muzzle flashes exploded out of the darkness.

313
00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:23.000
There was very little aimed fire.

314
00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:28.000
Instead, we were firing straight ahead and into their assigned zones.

315
00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:32.000
Soon, screams came from our wounded.

316
00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:37.000
Join the chorus of battle cries, orders, and machine guns.

317
00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:42.000
Illuminating rounds from our mortar section soon lit up the area like a bull park,

318
00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:46.000
making the North Korean soldiers look like silhouettes on a firing range.

319
00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:50.000
We dropped several before the flare burned out.

320
00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:55.000
Since the rounds were in short supply, the mortar's weighted several minutes between rounds.

321
00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:01.000
During a lull, I could hear one of the engineers to our left screaming in pain

322
00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.000
and calling for his mother.

323
00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:10.000
His sobbs and screams for help landed harder than the North Korean artillery shells.

324
00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:16.000
Finally, private zones, one of my young smartasses had heard enough.

325
00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:19.000
He started to yell and scream.

326
00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:23.000
I covered walls as he scrambled out to Jones.

327
00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:27.000
He was on the bottom of Hall's hole crying.

328
00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:29.000
Walls tried to get him up but he wouldn't move.

329
00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:33.000
I climbed out and helped Walls drag Jones' ass out of the foxhole.

330
00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.000
You stay with Hall. I told Walls.

331
00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:39.000
Snatching Jones by his shirt collar, I stumbled with him back to my foxhole.

332
00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:42.000
He crawled in and huddled against the wall sobbing.

333
00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:46.000
He couldn't talk even when I asked him a simple question.

334
00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:48.000
His body heaved with every sob.

335
00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:55.000
The engineer had finally stopped screaming and now in an ever-dest-revoiced pleaded for someone to come get him.

336
00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:00.000
Staying your holes, I barked.

337
00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:06.000
I was sure the North Koreans were lying in wait hoping someone would try and get him.

338
00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:11.000
God I wish he would just die.

339
00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:15.000
That fought sent a joke through me.

340
00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:20.000
Jesus Christ, I didn't really mean that, that poor son of a bitch.

341
00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:26.000
My only thought now was, please God, bring the daylight soon.

342
00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:38.000
When the sun's rays finally peaked over the horizon, we started getting the wounded off the hill.

343
00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:45.000
So, there you go, like I said, there's some people that are not going to react well.

344
00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:50.000
And you got this kid Jones that can't handle us situation.

345
00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:55.000
He's done. He's done. What is this night, too? He's done.

346
00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:00.000
And obviously it doesn't help when you've got to warn of your wounded guys out just ahead of you.

347
00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:05.000
And he's screaming for help and crying for help.

348
00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:06.000
And you can't do anything.

349
00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:11.000
And the order from Richardson, which is, you know, staying your holes.

350
00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:17.000
And again, this is the same exact thing that T-Fread Harvey talked about when they captured one of his guys.

351
00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:20.000
And they, the Japanese sat and tortured him.

352
00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.000
It sounded like 30, 40 meters away.

353
00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:25.000
They tortured this guy the whole night.

354
00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:29.000
And the whole night T-Fread Harvey's, you know, leaders were saying,

355
00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:32.000
Stay in your hole, stay in your holes, we're staying.

356
00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:42.000
What a, what a, what a nightmare that is.

357
00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:46.000
Back to the book, Walls grabbed me. And here's what Walls says,

358
00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:51.000
Search, black lost it. He's crying. He's hugging a tree and will not respond to me.

359
00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:54.000
Black, I didn't know him very well.

360
00:27:54.000 --> 00:28:00.000
He was one of the company's problem children. He'd gotten drunk after a unit picnic at four devons in the military police.

361
00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:03.000
It locked him up for being drunk and disorderly.

362
00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:09.000
This incident confirmed that what I thought already, black was going to be a constant problem.

363
00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:15.000
I put him in Walls' squad and we both kept on his ass making sure he was doing the right thing.

364
00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:19.000
When I got to black, he was wrapped around a tree like a vine.

365
00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:23.000
Every time a shell landed nearby, he began shaking and crying.

366
00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:29.000
No talking was going to help. I just wanted to get him away from the rest of the men.

367
00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:40.000
The section had fought well, but after listening to the engineer all night, they had their own nerves to contend with.

368
00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:44.000
That made two men within 24 hours.

369
00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:52.000
If this continued, I would lose the whole section to fear instead of the enemy.

370
00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:59.000
Two guys can't send him to the rear because he can't do anything with this guy.

371
00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:01.000
That's a tough call to make.

372
00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:04.000
If I send this guy to the rear, how is that going to affect everyone else on the team?

373
00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:11.000
Everyone else on the team is going to be thinking, oh, all I need to do is cry and scream and I'll save my ass.

374
00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:24.000
So, you know, in my opinion, if you're in these situations, I think if you're scared to die, it's going to be a problem.

375
00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:27.000
If you're scared to die, it's going to be a problem.

376
00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:35.000
If you basically accept the fact that you could die and you're okay with that, that's how you...

377
00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:39.000
To me, that's the difference between these two guys and everyone else.

378
00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:46.000
They want to die, no, I'm not saying they want to die, but they recognize they can die and they're okay with it.

379
00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:50.000
Maybe okay with this strong word, they accept it.

380
00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:51.000
I should say they accept it.

381
00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:58.000
Whereas these two guys are scared and if you're scared to die, then I think this is the kind of thing that happens.

382
00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:02.000
Obviously, if you're like, okay, you know what, there's a chance I could die.

383
00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:04.000
And that's the way it is.

384
00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:11.000
And I'm willing to take that chance and I'm going to do my best. Like, that's one attitude. The other attitude is, I don't want to die.

385
00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:18.000
And here I am in a situation where death is everywhere around me and that just closes in on your brain.

386
00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:19.000
Right?

387
00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:23.000
That just closes in on your brain. I can't imagine...

388
00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:26.000
I can't imagine how that would affect you psychologically.

389
00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:29.000
If you are scared of dying, and again, I don't want to...

390
00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:35.000
I'm not trying to sound like, hey, I want to die or troops on the front line or like, yeah, we don't care if we die.

391
00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:37.000
No, I'm not talking about that.

392
00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:41.000
But to be able to psychologically say, hey, look, I could die.

393
00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:44.000
That's one of the possible outcomes here.

394
00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:47.000
And okay, I get it.

395
00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:49.000
And I'm okay with that.

396
00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:52.000
That's different than being, I don't want to die out.

397
00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:56.000
If you're main goal is to not die and you're in a combat situation,

398
00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:00.000
especially a really, really violent, hardcore combat situation like this.

399
00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:02.000
This isn't going to work out good for you.

400
00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:04.000
At all.

401
00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:05.000
Yeah.

402
00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:08.000
It's like when I, you know, when I used to work with MMA fighters,

403
00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:10.000
if they were scared of getting knocked out,

404
00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:11.000
yeah.

405
00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:14.000
If that's what they were scared of, it's really hard to not be,

406
00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:16.000
to go into that cage with any level of confidence.

407
00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.000
Because you're scared of that one thing that might happen.

408
00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:19.000
It's the same thing here.

409
00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:22.000
If you're so scared of that one thing happening,

410
00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.000
that's going to possess your brain.

411
00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:26.000
Yeah.

412
00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:28.000
And even if you're,

413
00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:30.000
I don't know, if you're new to boxing or something.

414
00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.000
You know, and you,

415
00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:35.000
it's like you haven't accepted the fact that you're going to get hit.

416
00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:36.000
Yeah.

417
00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.000
So every time like someone even flint,

418
00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:39.000
you know,

419
00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:41.000
if they throw a faint,

420
00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:43.000
you're reacting to everything.

421
00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:45.000
So if you're constantly under the,

422
00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:47.000
kind of stress,

423
00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:50.000
yeah, the stress of like bullet and all this stuff,

424
00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:52.000
it's like you're what it, what you call yourself,

425
00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:53.000
preservation.

426
00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:54.000
Yeah.

427
00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:57.000
Uh, mechanism in your brain is just firing,

428
00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:58.000
firing, firing,

429
00:31:58.000 --> 00:31:59.000
and then after a while,

430
00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:01.000
that thing is just like gone,

431
00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:02.000
hey, why are you ready?

432
00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:03.000
Yeah.

433
00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:04.000
It's gone into overdrive.

434
00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:05.000
That's what's happening to these guys,

435
00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:07.000
man. It's horrible to see.

436
00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:08.000
Yeah.

437
00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:09.000
All right, back to the book.

438
00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:11.000
The smoke and dust still hung in the air

439
00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:13.000
when they attacked again.

440
00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:15.000
The first waves came with rifles.

441
00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:16.000
Behind them,

442
00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:20.000
more soldiers followed and picked up the weapons left by the dead.

443
00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:23.000
So that's a, that's a common battle plan we're,

444
00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:26.000
we're going to hear is then we've heard it before in,

445
00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:28.000
in other books about the Korean War.

446
00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:30.000
Hey, we're going to send the first wave.

447
00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:32.000
They're going to have rifles and magazines.

448
00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:34.000
The next wave is just going to come and pick up

449
00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:37.000
the dead guys gear and use that.

450
00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:39.000
So part of the plan is the guy's dying.

451
00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:41.000
Part of the plan is the part of the plan.

452
00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:41.000
Yeah.

453
00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:41.000
Yeah.

454
00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:43.000
Absolutely part of the plan.

455
00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:45.000
And not a small amount either,

456
00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:47.000
because you know,

457
00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:49.000
when you win the military,

458
00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:51.000
when you plan a big operation,

459
00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:53.000
you plan for casualties.

460
00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:55.000
And I can't say this about the seal teams.

461
00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:57.000
The seal teams is like, okay,

462
00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:58.000
like we're going to take this amount of casualties.

463
00:32:58.000 --> 00:32:59.000
The seal teams doesn't do that.

464
00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:01.000
We're not planning to take any casualties.

465
00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:03.000
But like you go with a big,

466
00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:07.000
a big division going in for a airborne drop in World War II.

467
00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:08.000
They were like, okay,

468
00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:12.000
10% of these folks are going to be injured on the drop.

469
00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:13.000
Boom, that's it.

470
00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:14.000
So,

471
00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:15.000
yeah.

472
00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:17.000
And these guys are just saying,

473
00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:20.000
hey, we got whatever 300 guys attacking.

474
00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:25.000
We need about 70 guns or whatever that number is.

475
00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:26.000
Back to the book.

476
00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:29.000
Almost every attack the North Koreans tried to slip behind our lines

477
00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:32.000
and caught off our avenue of retreat.

478
00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:34.000
Once they did, they would pound our flanks.

479
00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:36.000
This time the North Korean soldiers charged up

480
00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:39.000
Hill right into the teeth of our machine guns.

481
00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:41.000
After the third attempt,

482
00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:44.000
they quit and we settled in for a tense night.

483
00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:46.000
We waited all night,

484
00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:48.000
but they didn't attack again.

485
00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:50.000
North Koreans instead went around us

486
00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:54.000
and caught off the road back to Tabu-dong.

487
00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:57.000
As the fingers of the pink light shot up over the horizon,

488
00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:00.000
we were ordered to withdraw through the Korean line.

489
00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:04.000
This was not going to be easy.

490
00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:06.000
So, going back,

491
00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:08.000
so they're getting called back.

492
00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:09.000
Hey, there's a Korean line,

493
00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:13.000
and they're getting told to fall back past that line.

494
00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:18.000
They're basically, they're kind of surrounded even at this point.

495
00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:20.000
And here we go.

496
00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:24.000
He kind of expands on what it was like from his perspective.

497
00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:26.000
He talks a little bit about this.

498
00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:29.000
Just general Walton Walker's mobile defense,

499
00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:31.000
which was, hey,

500
00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:34.000
basically use a thin line of people

501
00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:37.000
to sort of sort of hold up the enemy

502
00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:39.000
and then as like a screen

503
00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:42.000
and then the bulk of the force would be ready for a counterattack.

504
00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:46.000
It was kind of considered a theory at this time,

505
00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:48.000
but this is what they were trying to do.

506
00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:50.000
And then he says, for us ground troops,

507
00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:51.000
it was confusing.

508
00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:54.000
This game of chess had become maddening.

509
00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:56.000
I never had a map

510
00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:00.000
and seldom knew the number designation of the Hills or objectives.

511
00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:02.000
Now that's crazy.

512
00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:04.000
That's freaking crazy.

513
00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:05.000
And you've heard me say this,

514
00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:09.000
the most important piece of information you can have on the battlefield is where you are.

515
00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:12.000
If you don't even have a map,

516
00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:14.000
and he's a section leader and doesn't have a map,

517
00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:17.000
just FYI, like nowadays,

518
00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:23.000
when we go out every single guy has a detailed battle map of the whole area of operations.

519
00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:28.000
To think that you have a section leader that doesn't even have a map,

520
00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:30.000
that's crazy.

521
00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:32.000
And then the number designations he talks about,

522
00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:35.000
when you know you hear about Hills 348 or whatever,

523
00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:37.000
he doesn't even know what those are.

524
00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:40.000
Back to the book, we only knew to move, attack,

525
00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:45.000
and defend unknown Hills that would stop the North Koreans from breaking through and capturing the city of Tegu.

526
00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:47.000
This was our world,

527
00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:51.000
following orders fighting for one another, being successful,

528
00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:53.000
and somehow surviving.

529
00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:02.000
Now they're sort of in a little low in the fighting,

530
00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:07.000
and one of his guys comes over, the guy's name is Gray.

531
00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:08.000
I'm not feeling very good.

532
00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:11.000
I need to sit down for a few minutes, Gray said,

533
00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:13.000
his head was pounding and he felt dizzy.

534
00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:15.000
Try to come over as soon as you can.

535
00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:16.000
Are you going to be alright?

536
00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:18.000
Yeah, just give me a few minutes.

537
00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:20.000
When we got to the other side of the ridge,

538
00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:23.000
I turned and looked back at Gray sitting on a tree stump.

539
00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:26.000
He had his head in his hands.

540
00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:28.000
Now we know what this is a symbol of, right?

541
00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:31.000
This is a symbol of like a little bit of combat stress happening,

542
00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:33.000
but he's just trying to get it together.

543
00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:36.000
Gray and Wall should have been great squad leaders,

544
00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:38.000
and I hope you is okay.

545
00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:41.000
I needed him to, I needed him and his leadership.

546
00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:45.000
I had taken off my helmet to wipe away some sweat,

547
00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:50.000
when Gray and the stump suddenly disappeared in a fireball,

548
00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:53.000
and artillery round landed right on him.

549
00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:58.000
I was stunned and just stood on the ridge looking at the smoking crater.

550
00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:02.000
Something happens to men who see combat.

551
00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:06.000
No matter how you try, you cannot make death invisible.

552
00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:09.000
It is there with you every moment.

553
00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:13.000
That split second would be seared into my mind for the rest of my life.

554
00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:17.000
But at that time, we didn't have time to mourn Gray.

555
00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:20.000
We had to get dug in, start digging.

556
00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:23.000
That round has us zeroed,

557
00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:26.000
and the barrage will be coming next, I said, grabbing Walls.

558
00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:28.000
Get all over and take charge of Gray's squad.

559
00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:32.000
Tell them I'll be over there to talk to him later.

560
00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:36.000
For the rest of the day, I kept the men busy.

561
00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:39.000
Anything to keep their minds off Gray.

562
00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:43.000
So let's think about that again.

563
00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:48.000
You can see that Richardson is legit.

564
00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:52.000
And this is your classic situation where this horrible thing,

565
00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:55.000
you witness this horrible thing, everyone sees it.

566
00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:59.000
And what does he say? Hey, look, and this is horrifying.

567
00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:02.000
You say, oh, they have us zeroed in.

568
00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:05.000
So where the rest of the next round is going to hit, they're going to hit all around us.

569
00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:08.000
So what we need to do is dig in and we need to do it now.

570
00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:11.000
And then he just immediately says, hall, go take over Gray's squad.

571
00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:14.000
Look, Gray's gone. We need to move on.

572
00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:17.000
Tell them I'll be over to talk to him later.

573
00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:23.000
Back to the book.

574
00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:26.000
What drove me more than anything was a positive outlook.

575
00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:30.000
And the fact that my men were watching everything I did.

576
00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:35.000
I often wondered when we were moving down the road went went through their minds.

577
00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:38.000
This is something that every leader should be thinking about all the time.

578
00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:40.000
Is that everyone's watching you?

579
00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:42.000
Your boys are watching you.

580
00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:44.000
And they're judging you.

581
00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:46.000
As harsh as that sound, that's what's happening.

582
00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:49.000
So you know what? Give them a good example.

583
00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:56.000
I'll tell you what. When I see leaders in the seal teams that didn't act that way,

584
00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:02.000
that didn't act as if they were being watched all the time, they usually slacked off.

585
00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:04.000
Like, what does that look like?

586
00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:06.000
Where? Oh, what it looks like.

587
00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:09.000
I mean, yeah, like, hey, oh, no, no, I can be a little bit late.

588
00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:11.000
No one's watching. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

589
00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:13.000
That's a big one. Oh, it's okay.

590
00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:17.000
I don't need this piece of gear. Oh, I'll cut the corner on this thing.

591
00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:19.000
Just all those little tiny things.

592
00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:22.000
And not to mention when you're in a situation like this,

593
00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:24.000
when you're watching you, when you say, hey, you know what?

594
00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:26.000
They got a style then we need to get dug in now.

595
00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:29.000
Hall, you got that gray squad now. Get to it.

596
00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:30.000
They're watching that too.

597
00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:31.000
Yeah.

598
00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:33.000
And they're seeing and going, okay, they're judging.

599
00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:35.000
And what are they judging? They're judging positive.

600
00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:37.000
They're judging that Richardson's got to shit together.

601
00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:39.000
And he's going to take care of them.

602
00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:44.000
Mm-hmm.

603
00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:47.000
Back to the book. It had to be a lot tougher on them than on me.

604
00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:52.000
While they had only death dwell on, I had dozens of other things

605
00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:55.000
that I must be thinking about and prepared for what was ahead.

606
00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:58.000
Where would I be if I were a North Korean?

607
00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:00.000
How would I react if we got hit from the right or left?

608
00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:05.000
How was our ammunition? Water was the bore sighting of the gun still all right.

609
00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:07.000
Where were the men taking care of their feet?

610
00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:12.000
So he's saying this correctly so, but this is kind of a different twist.

611
00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:16.000
Is, you know, a lot of times you hear the leader say, well, I was responsible for all these guys

612
00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:17.000
and that was a heavier weight.

613
00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:21.000
But for him, he's thinking, I was busy with all these other things.

614
00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:24.000
All these other guys had to do is think about the fact that they're about to die.

615
00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:25.000
Mm-hmm.

616
00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:27.000
And how that's actually hargur on them.

617
00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:28.000
Right.

618
00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:36.000
See, if you go into it with the perspective that everything's for you is hargur.

619
00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:39.000
And for everything, you know, for me it's hargur, because I'm a leader,

620
00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:45.000
whereas his attitude is fantastic, which is look, I'm the luxury of having other things to think about.

621
00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:49.000
These poor guys, they're just thinking about them being overrun.

622
00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:55.000
As opposed to if your attitude was flipped and you were thinking, I have it so hard,

623
00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:57.000
but these guys have it so easy.

624
00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:59.000
They will sense that.

625
00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:00.000
Yeah.

626
00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:05.000
And that's not going to end up net positive for you and your leadership.

627
00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:10.000
Back to book, the next North Korean assault started with screams and machine gun fire,

628
00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:13.000
but we beat it back with mortars in our own machine gun fire.

629
00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:18.000
Running between holes, I made sure everybody was ready for the next wave.

630
00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:20.000
Walsh had his section up and ready to fire.

631
00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:26.000
Hall was also ready, which was impressive, since he had just taken over from gray.

632
00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:28.000
The second attack was worse.

633
00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:32.000
The North Koreans were less than 50 yards from us.

634
00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:38.000
As I fired at the shadows moving toward us, I heard a frantic voice come over the radio.

635
00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:42.000
Roy Rogers III, the voice said in a deep southern draw,

636
00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:44.000
I need more firepower.

637
00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:45.000
I need more firepower.

638
00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:46.000
I'm about to get overrun.

639
00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:50.000
It was lieutenant Jim Brown from the bulltune that was on our left.

640
00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:53.000
I hope to hell he got more fire support.

641
00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:56.000
We were all hanging by a thread.

642
00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:01.000
Dead North Korean soldiers were stacking up in front of our foxholes,

643
00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:05.000
but they kept coming, wave after wave.

644
00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:09.000
I could hear walls screaming at the mend to stay in their holes.

645
00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:16.000
I was frantically changing the magazine in my car being as two of the North Koreans were within ten feet of me.

646
00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:21.000
Walsh and Hall saw them too, and opened fire, cutting the North Korean soldiers down.

647
00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:24.000
I saw another North Korean to my right and fired.

648
00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:27.000
He staggered back and dropped to the ground.

649
00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:31.000
I stayed low in my foxhole and kept firing straight ahead.

650
00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:38.000
Hall and Walsh kept firing to the rear, hitting the North Koreans attempting to move through our position.

651
00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:44.000
We had them in a crossfire, and in minutes our position was littered with North Korean bodies.

652
00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:49.000
Slighting a fresh magazine into my car being, I poked my head up,

653
00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:53.000
waiting for the next wave, but it never came.

654
00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:58.000
Stay alert. Some of them may still be alive.

655
00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:01.000
If you see any movement, shoot them.

656
00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:05.000
We waited a few minutes and finally climbed out.

657
00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:10.000
Check around your holes for live Koreans.

658
00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:19.000
And he goes on to say that we dragged the rest of the bodies away from our position and piled them to one side.

659
00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:21.000
I didn't even look at their faces.

660
00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:27.000
And he talks about the fact that his medics would try and take care of the North Korean wounded soldiers.

661
00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:30.000
That's pretty impressive.

662
00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:33.000
Back to the book, as daylight peaked over, it's head over the hills.

663
00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:38.000
A tall scrubby looking infantryman carrying a carbine approach me from out of the mist.

664
00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:43.000
As you got closer, I saw the small white cross painted on his helmet.

665
00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:46.000
He stuck out his hand as he approached.

666
00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:51.000
Chaplain Kapon, he said, giving me a firm handshake. Where are you from?

667
00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:58.000
Chaplain Amel Kapon from Pilsen, Kansas was a Catholic father who joined the army toward the end of World War II.

668
00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:06.000
He served in Burma and India until May 1946. He returned home and was assigned a parish in Kansas.

669
00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:09.000
But he felt his calling was with the troops.

670
00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:12.000
So he rejoined the army in 1948.

671
00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:18.000
He joined us in Korea after spending a few months in Japan. His uniform was dirty and he liked the rest of us.

672
00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:19.000
Needed his shave.

673
00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:24.000
It was clear he'd spent the night up close to the fighting and not safely in the rear.

674
00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:28.000
There was a peacefulness about him, though, that put me at ease.

675
00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:31.000
A quiet confidence he seemed to care where I was from.

676
00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:35.000
And I watched him as he spoke to the rest of the section.

677
00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:39.000
Each time he asked a soldier where he was from, gave him a firm handshake.

678
00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:42.000
It was not long before he had us all smiling.

679
00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:47.000
When Kapon finished making his rounds, he sat down near my fox hole and took out his pipe.

680
00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:50.000
It was missing most of its stem.

681
00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:52.000
What happened to your pipe?

682
00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:57.000
I asked as he filled it. A sniper he said, shot it out of my mouth a few days ago.

683
00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:00.000
We both had a laugh.

684
00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:03.000
I noticed that carbine laying across his lap.

685
00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:06.000
I thought Chaplain couldn't carry weapons.

686
00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:11.000
He smiled and nodded. If they're going to shoot at me, I'm going to be ready to shoot back.

687
00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:18.000
My section was down to eight men.

688
00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:21.000
We received two replacements.

689
00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:24.000
They showed up with their gear and clean uniforms.

690
00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:26.000
One was named Jackson's.

691
00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:29.000
One was named Jackson, but I didn't catch the other's name.

692
00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:34.000
Jackson had a lot of questions about the North Koreans and where we were on the line.

693
00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:38.000
Stay close to your fox hole, partner, and listen to him. I said,

694
00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:40.000
I didn't see them again until next morning.

695
00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:44.000
We'd been attacked again, but this time we were able to keep the North Koreans from our lines,

696
00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:46.000
but not without cost.

697
00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:52.000
Three men were gone, one missing and two wounded, including both replacements.

698
00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:59.000
We were taking casualties every night, and soon could no longer hold our position.

699
00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:02.000
Later that night, we got orders to withdraw,

700
00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:04.000
withdrawing in the daylight was a bad enough.

701
00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:07.000
Now we are going to attempt it at night.

702
00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:15.000
So a couple of things you're going to hear a lot about this Chaplain Capon.

703
00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:19.000
And well, not a lot as you should.

704
00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:25.000
He's got his own story that needs to be told about what he did in his service.

705
00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:31.000
And then, you know, but I tried to pull out a few sections about him.

706
00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:36.000
And then the fact that these guys, I mean, they're losing guys all the time.

707
00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:39.000
You get two replacements and they're gone by the next morning.

708
00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:41.000
That's not a positive outlook on the situation.

709
00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:43.000
So they finally get the orders to withdraw.

710
00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:50.000
And it's funny, not funny, but it's interesting that they're actually not looking forward to withdrawing at night.

711
00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:53.000
You know, whereas me, my instinct is like, I'd rather go at night, right?

712
00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:55.000
Me, of course.

713
00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:59.000
But you know what, if you haven't trained that way, because you can train,

714
00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:02.000
even without night vision, you can train to operate at night.

715
00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:04.000
You learn the spacing that you need to get.

716
00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:10.000
You learn, you know, certain maneuvers that you do at night time that are easier at night time.

717
00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:13.000
So night time is not something to be scared of.

718
00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:16.000
But these guys, unless you haven't trained that way.

719
00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:19.000
If you haven't trained that way, man, I can't even imagine what it's like.

720
00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:21.000
Because I trained so much in the dark room.

721
00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:23.000
When I first got in the school teams, we did everything in the dark room.

722
00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:25.000
We just did, we just patrolled in dark.

723
00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:27.000
How we do, we had closer spacing.

724
00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:29.000
You learn how to use person silhouette.

725
00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:32.000
And front of you, you learn how to adapt your eyes to the dark.

726
00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:38.000
So there's all these things that you can do to make you a more formidable night fighter.

727
00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:44.000
But if you don't train that way, you're in big trouble.

728
00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:48.000
So these guys are starting up there with draw, back to the book.

729
00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:49.000
Let's go, I whispered.

730
00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:52.000
I was nervous and wanted to get going before another attack.

731
00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:54.000
Wall standing by looked over me.

732
00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:58.000
So he was kicking a guy on the ground saying, hey, let's go.

733
00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:01.000
And he's, you know, Wall says, so that's Johnson. He's dead.

734
00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:03.000
I felt terrible.

735
00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:05.000
It hurt to see another one of my men dead in the mud.

736
00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:07.000
I didn't even know Johnson that well.

737
00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:11.000
He was another replacement and I only just learned his name.

738
00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:16.000
The fact that I had a little time to dwell saved me.

739
00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:22.000
Plus, I knew that if I showed weakness, my men might finally give in and feel sorry for themselves.

740
00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:24.000
And I couldn't have that.

741
00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:26.000
We needed to stick together.

742
00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:31.000
I became stoic and would remain that way for a long time.

743
00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:35.000
Again, he recognizes that his guys are looking at him.

744
00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:36.000
There's two points.

745
00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:38.000
Number one, he recognizes that his guys are looking at him.

746
00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:41.000
And if he breaks down, he's going to cause breakdowns.

747
00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:44.000
And number two, the fact that he had a little time to dwell.

748
00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:46.000
So what does that mean?

749
00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:48.000
Translate that to your life.

750
00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:51.000
If something goes wrong and you decide you're going to take a break

751
00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:55.000
to reflect on that thing, it don't do that.

752
00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:58.000
That's like get back on the horse, you know the old saying,

753
00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:00.000
like you got to get back on the horse.

754
00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:03.000
That's not what does that help you overcome the fear.

755
00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:06.000
But it's better than sitting around and dwelling on it.

756
00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:09.000
You know, even if it's something not physical that you're physically afraid of,

757
00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:11.000
still don't sit around and dwell.

758
00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:14.000
That's a bad thing.

759
00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:18.000
Yeah, like what you're saying, it gives you something happens.

760
00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:21.000
Right, grow it right so with you.

761
00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:22.000
I don't know.

762
00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:25.000
And you take the day off from work.

763
00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:26.000
Right.

764
00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:29.000
We get to sit down and look at the pillow that's on the ceiling.

765
00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:30.000
Yeah.

766
00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:31.000
Yeah.

767
00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:32.000
Gonna jam you up, wait more.

768
00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:33.000
You go to work.

769
00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:36.000
And you know, your mind's occupied by these tasks.

770
00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:38.000
And you know, you don't have time to dwell.

771
00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:42.000
And meanwhile, I'll say this, your mind is still processing it.

772
00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:43.000
Right.

773
00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:44.000
It's not like it's not like you're at work.

774
00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:46.000
And so you're not thinking about it.

775
00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:48.000
It's in the back of it's getting work through your mind.

776
00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:51.000
It's doing its job kind of getting a grip on the situation.

777
00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:56.000
And then you get home and like instead of just going home, go train, go directly to the gym.

778
00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:59.000
You're actually kind of stoked because you're not have that pressure of your girl weight

779
00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:02.000
No, and you at home to like hurry up and get home like no.

780
00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:05.000
So we're trying to get some extra rounds and so go get some extra rounds.

781
00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:08.000
And maybe stop by that little place on the way home.

782
00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:11.000
Grab a little bite to eat, you know, with one of your buddies.

783
00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:12.000
Yeah.

784
00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:13.000
And then go home.

785
00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:15.000
And when you get home clean your room, you know, when you get home,

786
00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:20.000
you finish putting together the bookcase or whatever do something.

787
00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:23.000
And now you're tired and now you go to bed in a meanwhile, like I said,

788
00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:26.000
in the background, your mind's been processing this and you're starting to realize

789
00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:27.000
I can't know what.

790
00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:30.000
I'm just not actually that big of a deal with the she left.

791
00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:31.000
Yeah.

792
00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:32.000
Yeah.

793
00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:35.000
You know what, but isn't there the, I mean, I wonder why this is,

794
00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:37.000
I'm sure you could kind of figure it out.

795
00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:41.000
But you know, something like batter, traumatic or whatever will happen.

796
00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:45.000
And then the person essentially ignores it or whatever.

797
00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:47.000
And folks don't work, folks don't this, folks.

798
00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:51.000
And then people close to them are therapist or whatever would be like,

799
00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:53.000
Hey, I'm scared.

800
00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:57.000
I'm concerned because you haven't like, yeah, I think there's a dichotomy here.

801
00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:59.000
I'm not talking about burying it, right?

802
00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:00.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

803
00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:01.000
I'm not going to talk about.

804
00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:02.000
You still got to contend with it.

805
00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:06.000
And you know, at some point, I'll write down like the,

806
00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:09.000
the protocol, the breakup protocol.

807
00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:11.000
Straight up, straight up, right?

808
00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:15.000
And even like the death protocol, like here's what you're supposed to do.

809
00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:18.000
Now in these situations, they don't have time to do any protocol, right?

810
00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:19.000
Yeah.

811
00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:24.000
And so this to your point, this can be a problem because if you're in combat,

812
00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:30.000
and you lose someone, and then you never have the time to set aside and contend with it,

813
00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:33.000
then you get back and now you get back to America, now you're, you're family,

814
00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:35.000
and now you're getting a new job, and you're getting out of the military,

815
00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:37.000
and you're making all this stuff happen.

816
00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:39.000
You never contended with what had occurred.

817
00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:41.000
So yes, you are correct.

818
00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:45.000
If you don't ever contend with it in face it, then it can turn into a problem,

819
00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:47.000
then it turns into what we talked about with Tim Ferriss,

820
00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:51.000
which is they tried, if you tried to bury it, you didn't realize it.

821
00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:52.000
It was a seed.

822
00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:53.000
Yeah.

823
00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:57.000
So you've got to, you got to make sure that it's not a seed that's going to grow out of control

824
00:51:57.000 --> 00:51:58.000
in the darkness over there.

825
00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:00.000
You got to, you got to put the shed some light on it.

826
00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:02.000
Yeah, because, because that's how, right?

827
00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:05.000
Like a lot of the time, like, oh, you know,

828
00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:08.000
I, you know, my girl broke up with, I don't know, whatever.

829
00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:11.000
Like something traumatic, and then they'll be like, hey, I don't want to think about it.

830
00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:12.000
I want to focus on these other things.

831
00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:16.000
I don't want to think about it, and they kind of bury it.

832
00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:17.000
Seems like that kind of happens.

833
00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:18.000
Yeah, no.

834
00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:19.000
And that's what I'm saying.

835
00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:20.000
There's a balance that you have to do.

836
00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:21.000
Yeah.

837
00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:23.000
There's a balance, because you can't just bury it.

838
00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:23.000
Yeah.

839
00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:24.000
You have to contend with it.

840
00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:25.000
Yeah.

841
00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:26.000
But you want to do it.

842
00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:32.000
What you don't want to do is go overboard and just focus 100% on, I can't believe,

843
00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:35.000
that this person's gone, whether they died, whether they broke up with you, whether they,

844
00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:37.000
what, you know, I get little, you know, it's funny.

845
00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:42.000
I get little warrior kid questions for the warrior kid podcast of my friend is moving away.

846
00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:43.000
How can I not be sad?

847
00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:45.000
And it's like the same thing.

848
00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:47.000
Like, people are going to come in and out of your life.

849
00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:49.000
And you got to learn to contend with it.

850
00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:50.000
Yeah.

851
00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:54.000
And what I'm saying is, don't focus on it 100%.

852
00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:59.000
Remember it contend with it, but don't dwell on it, because we know what that gets you.

853
00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:00.000
Yeah.

854
00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:05.000
And you just down the darkness, the spiral of darkness, which you don't want to go down.

855
00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:06.000
No.

856
00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:08.000
We don't want to avoid it, because then it grows.

857
00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:09.000
Yeah.

858
00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:11.000
Behind your back.

859
00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:12.000
Yeah.

860
00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:13.000
Well, his situation is kind of different.

861
00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:18.000
That's more of a small picture scenario where it's like, I don't have time to dwell on my guy who just,

862
00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:23.000
this just happened to him because right now is this important thing going on.

863
00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:28.000
And again, this is where people get jammed up because they never

864
00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:30.000
contend with it.

865
00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:32.000
They never mourn properly.

866
00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:34.000
They never go through that process.

867
00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:37.000
And then they look up six months later.

868
00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:39.000
And they go, oh, I'm sad.

869
00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:40.000
I miss my friend.

870
00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:41.000
It's like, yeah, that's okay.

871
00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:42.000
You know what?

872
00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:43.000
You got to take.

873
00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:48.000
That's why you should be able to take the protocol and just enact it when there's, you know, like,

874
00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:49.000
you get home from the plumbing.

875
00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:52.000
It's like, okay, we're going through the protocol because we, you know, do.

876
00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:55.000
Or you lose a friend car accident, whatever.

877
00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:57.000
Whatever situation.

878
00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:01.000
You, you want it to come's time to enact that protocol.

879
00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:06.000
Boom, you, you, you, you press play on the protocol and then you go through the motions and that gets you,

880
00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:08.000
get you through it.

881
00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:09.000
Yeah.

882
00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:12.000
Or at least starts to get you through it because it's always going to be there.

883
00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:13.000
Right.

884
00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:16.000
It's not like you're going to be like, oh, you're always going to remember.

885
00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:17.000
Yeah.

886
00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:19.000
But don't dwell.

887
00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:20.000
Don't dwell.

888
00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:24.000
All right.

889
00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:25.000
Going back to the book.

890
00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:28.000
It was another attack.

891
00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:34.000
And when I say that, he's actually talking about there being told that they are going to attack again.

892
00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:37.000
And this is coming from his boss, macabee.

893
00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:41.000
The entire battalion is going to attack hills 570.

894
00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:44.000
Three ridges go direct to the top of the hill.

895
00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:46.000
K company will be on the left.

896
00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:49.000
We will move in the center and I company on the right.

897
00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:53.000
We will attack at daylight with no artillery or air support.

898
00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:54.000
Boom.

899
00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:55.000
Yeah.

900
00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:56.000
Don't like that.

901
00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:57.000
He didn't like to know.

902
00:54:57.000 --> 00:55:00.000
The second and third battunes will attack a breast.

903
00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:02.000
Second on the right, third on the left.

904
00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:05.000
Richardson will follow with the 57s in the center.

905
00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:07.000
The first battoon will be in reserve.

906
00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:08.000
So there's your plan.

907
00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:09.000
Boom.

908
00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:10.000
There it is.

909
00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:12.000
What does a breast mean side by side?

910
00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:13.000
Okay.

911
00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:14.000
Side base.

912
00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:15.000
Yep.

913
00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:17.000
And now.

914
00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:22.000
So they're sort of going through and starting to enact this plan.

915
00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:25.000
And as they're doing this one, his voice says,

916
00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:28.000
Sards, we're getting out of here by dark, right?

917
00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:31.000
I knew the other men wouldn't speak up,

918
00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:33.000
but I could just look in their eyes and see they were scared.

919
00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:36.000
I just hope they couldn't see fear in my eyes.

920
00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:38.000
We're staying here until we get orders.

921
00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:40.000
I said finally answering a wall, should haul.

922
00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:43.000
I spoke up loud enough for the whole section here.

923
00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:47.000
The third down the hill, more than artillery fire was heavy.

924
00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:50.000
We could see the North Korean positions and they could see us.

925
00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:55.000
I was hoping we were out of grenade range and two close for their to their position for them to put

926
00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:56.000
mortar fire on us.

927
00:55:56.000 --> 00:56:00.000
Dude, what kind of situation are you in when what you're hoping for?

928
00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:04.000
Is that you're too far for grenade range and two close for mortars?

929
00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:07.000
Yeah.

930
00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:09.000
Oh man.

931
00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:13.000
So that just puts you in machine gun range basically.

932
00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:18.000
Unless you got some kind of dead space or cover, but not a good situation.

933
00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:21.000
But you know when that's what you're hoping for,

934
00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:22.000
Outlook is not good.

935
00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:23.000
That's your best option.

936
00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:24.000
Yeah.

937
00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:28.000
Soon instead of mortars, the North Korean soldiers started sending down taunts.

938
00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:33.000
We didn't speak the language, but each word had a charge.

939
00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:34.000
Silence.

940
00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:35.000
No one talks back.

941
00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:37.000
I whispered and put my finger to my lips.

942
00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:40.000
Not that we knew what they were saying.

943
00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:47.000
As the minutes and then hours ticked off, I realized that slowly, but surely we were moving back a foot at a time.

944
00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:52.000
A guy would reposition and the rest of the whole section would go off of him.

945
00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:55.000
At this rate, we might be off the hill by the end of the war.

946
00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:57.000
A new one thing.

947
00:56:57.000 --> 00:57:01.000
There was no way we were staying overnight.

948
00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:06.000
So situation happens.

949
00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:10.000
They start actually, there's a firing starts.

950
00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:13.000
And these guys actually start running down the hill.

951
00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:16.000
And then they start receiving small arms fire.

952
00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:19.000
And then he rolls into another position.

953
00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:30.000
And there's a guy in there named valencourt who was another experienced guy in charge of one of the other sections or one of the other elements.

954
00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:34.000
And he comes in, where's the executive officer I asked valencourt when I caught up with him?

955
00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:37.000
He was killed along with one of the other platoon leaders.

956
00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:43.000
The company is regrouped and tried to come back up the hill, but it was ripped apart by heavy mortar and artillery fire.

957
00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:46.000
We lost two lieutenant and two platoons, took heavy losses.

958
00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:59.000
So that continues.

959
00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:01.000
And again, you got to get this book.

960
00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:03.000
So you can get these details.

961
00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:04.000
Not reading them all.

962
00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:06.000
The detailed combat.

963
00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:14.000
For anyone that's in combat arms of any kind, or to this book immediately, because there's so much good information in it that I'm not covering.

964
00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:17.000
So these guys, they're retreating from that attack.

965
00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:19.000
They get to like an orchard situation.

966
00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:22.000
And there's a kernel that's in charge of the regimen.

967
00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:28.000
And this guy, macabee, who's the company commander, he comes up.

968
00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:31.000
And here we go.

969
00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:35.000
Macabee's kind of talking with and brings Richardson over.

970
00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:38.000
Sergeant Richardson and his men were the last ones off the hill.

971
00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:41.000
Macabee told Colonel Johnson how you're men doing?

972
00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:48.000
The kernel asked looking over my shoulder at the men finishing up their letter to seers that this little joke that they made earlier.

973
00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:50.000
Okay, but very tired.

974
00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:53.000
Johnson nodded and shook my hand.

975
00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:55.000
Trying to get some rest tonight.

976
00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:58.000
He started to walk away, frustrated with the attack.

977
00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:02.000
I knew this was my chance to speak my mind and the mind of my men.

978
00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:09.000
I wanted to know how many more times we are going to have to climb up a hill, only to leave it, and fight our way up another.

979
00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:13.000
From my point of view, we were just getting our asses kicked.

980
00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:15.000
How are we doing?

981
00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:18.000
It seems like we never make any headway.

982
00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:20.000
Johnson stopped.

983
00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:24.000
Sergeant Richardson, you tell your men they did a great job.

984
00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:29.000
Against great odds, we have stopped the North Koreans' main attack.

985
00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:32.000
I turned away and slowly walked back toward the men.

986
00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:37.000
I thought to myself how great, wall, hall, and higley were.

987
00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:41.000
It was their courage and bravery that held us together.

988
00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:45.000
As I looked at them, it almost brought tears to my eyes.

989
00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:49.000
Johnson's news had an immediate impact on my section.

990
00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:52.000
We no longer dragged us instead.

991
00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:56.000
We seemed hopeful even optimistic.

992
00:59:56.000 --> 01:00:06.000
So, again, this is a good point that when your in a leadership position, your little words have significant impact.

993
01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
And you might not realize it.

994
01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:15.000
I experienced that a lot with leaders not only in combat, or in the military, but I see that with leaders in the civilian sector,

995
01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:18.000
where they don't realize the weight that they carry.

996
01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:21.000
And this will even be like the CEO of a company.

997
01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:27.000
We'll say something, maybe it's off the cuff, and it's a negative thing, and it has a negative impact.

998
01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:31.000
But they also don't realize how positive it can be when they say something positive.

999
01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:34.000
So if you're in a leadership position, everyone's going to say,

1000
01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:37.000
everyone's going to say, well, throw out some love to your people.

1001
01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:38.000
Right?

1002
01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:44.000
I'm not saying, you know, life likes to use the word false cheerleading, which is definitely, yeah, that's a good term.

1003
01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:48.000
You know, which is, hey, you've done a great job when you didn't do a great job.

1004
01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:52.000
And cheerleading is cheerleading is cheerleading is cheerleading pretty much no matter what.

1005
01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:53.000
That's just how you do.

1006
01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:54.000
Yeah, that's just what their job is.

1007
01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:55.000
They're cheering you.

1008
01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:58.000
Hey, good job, even though you're down 47 to 0.

1009
01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
They don't stop, right?

1010
01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:01.000
I don't think they can.

1011
01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
They just keep cheering.

1012
01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:06.000
So I guess you don't even have to say false cheerleading.

1013
01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
You just say straight cheerleading.

1014
01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:13.000
Well, oh, I guess when they're, when it's winning, then it's positive, right?

1015
01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:16.000
Yeah, so hey, let me ask you this about false cheerleading.

1016
01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:20.000
So because I came up with a mustard by the way, someone thought that it was just,

1017
01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:25.000
like, focusing on the positives and not the negatives, then they were like, that's false cheerleading.

1018
01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:30.000
Or they implied that that's what, and life was like, no false cheerleading is when you're cheering for someone,

1019
01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
even though they're not doing a good job.

1020
01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:35.000
Yeah, or making statements that are factually untrue.

1021
01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:38.000
Hey, echo, you did a great job putting out a bunch of videos this last year.

1022
01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:41.000
Oh, that's actually factually untrue, and I wouldn't be able to say that to you.

1023
01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:44.000
Because you put out a limited number of videos.

1024
01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:45.000
Yeah.

1025
01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:49.000
But if you were to say, hey, those are real quality and not quantity, like that would be factually true, too.

1026
01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:54.000
Yeah, yeah, actually technically that's opinion, but hey, okay, so what about this?

1027
01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:55.000
Here's my question.

1028
01:01:55.000 --> 01:02:00.000
So if we'll let's say, okay, I'm doing, like this, you know, 60%.

1029
01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:04.000
60% of my workload is great.

1030
01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:08.000
And then there's 40 that's like, hey, you've got to change this.

1031
01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:15.000
And then I sort of, it's just sort of downplay the 40, you, not me, you, like my boss, downplay the 40.

1032
01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:20.000
Just to encourage me whatever reason and you really, upplay the 60.

1033
01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
Is that false cheerleading?

1034
01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:28.000
It is, but there's a little bit more strategy behind this, because as your leader,

1035
01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:31.000
I wouldn't only talk to you one time.

1036
01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:32.000
Yeah.

1037
01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
Right? I'm talking to you over a period of time.

1038
01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:41.000
So what, my first comment to you might be something like, hey, echo that 60% that you're over there.

1039
01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:42.000
You're crushed and did that.

1040
01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:43.000
That you're doing a great job.

1041
01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:44.000
It's super.

1042
01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:49.000
So, you know, some of the other stuff, not quite there yet, but, but actually the first time I talk to you,

1043
01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
might be like, hey, you're crushing it.

1044
01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:52.000
You're doing awesome.

1045
01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
I might've been mentioning that 40%.

1046
01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
Because I'm thinking, hey, if this guy gets encouraged,

1047
01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
he's going to be like, I'm going to do a little bit more, right?

1048
01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
And yeah, that you just might pick up the sock.

1049
01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:04.000
Anyways, on your own accord, because you're just encouraged by the whole,

1050
01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
the whole positivity that I'm giving you.

1051
01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:07.000
Yeah.

1052
01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:08.000
So that's cool, right?

1053
01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:08.000
Mm-hmm.

1054
01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
Well, maybe it doesn't work.

1055
01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:13.000
So now I might have to come just a little bit more direct, right?

1056
01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:14.000
Yeah.

1057
01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
Hey, I noticed that, you know, this 60% over here that you're dominating,

1058
01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:17.000
and it's awesome.

1059
01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:22.000
Is there something with this 40% over here that's different that, you know,

1060
01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:25.000
that it comes because it seems to be like a different level,

1061
01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000
and it's not up to 60% is there's something that's different.

1062
01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000
Maybe I find it, learn something, right?

1063
01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000
But I give you the opportunity to say, well, yeah, it's because of this,

1064
01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000
whatever, maybe we can correct it.

1065
01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:41.000
And then if that doesn't work, then maybe you have to amplify or escalate a little bit more, right?

1066
01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:44.000
And then it's hey, man, the 60% that you're doing,

1067
01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
wow, awesome.

1068
01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:47.000
Yes?

1069
01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:50.000
There's also that 40% that when I'm looking at it,

1070
01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:53.000
I'm actually wondering if it's the same guy.

1071
01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
Because for you to be able to do this over here,

1072
01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:59.000
and still kind of throw this in the mix too.

1073
01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
Yeah, kind of, doesn't make sense to me.

1074
01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:06.000
And I'm, again, my whole thing would be trying to figure out why you're slacking in that area.

1075
01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
Yeah, because if you're doing 60% great, why are you doing 40% there?

1076
01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
Let's hope there's a reason behind that.

1077
01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:11.000
Yeah.

1078
01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:14.000
And so once we find out what that reason is, it's like, okay.

1079
01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:18.000
And so I'm going to slowly escalate and start until I get to the point,

1080
01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
you know, if we go to six months,

1081
01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:23.000
and I've done and I've pulled out whatever obstacles in your way,

1082
01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000
because it was some obstacles on the 40%.

1083
01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
Well, we weren't getting that information in time.

1084
01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
Okay, well, let's now start getting you an information in time.

1085
01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
And then you say, well, I didn't have the resources.

1086
01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000
Okay, well, then I throw you another person to help you.

1087
01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:34.000
And you're still slacking.

1088
01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:37.000
So eventually, you know, I'm going to have to come a little bit more direct.

1089
01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:42.000
And be less than, man, the 60% I appreciate the 40% is actually starting to hurt us.

1090
01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:46.000
And either you need to step it up, which is why I'm hoping,

1091
01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
because I see nothing but potential in you,

1092
01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:52.000
and I'm going to actually have to bring someone else in that can kind of handle 100%.

1093
01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:53.000
Do you see what I'm coming from?

1094
01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:54.000
Yeah.

1095
01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:55.000
And it would even escalate from there.

1096
01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:59.000
So yeah, there's, I don't think of things as black and white conversations.

1097
01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:00.000
Yeah.

1098
01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:04.000
Like, hey, I just need to go in and drop the hammer today, because I don't.

1099
01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:05.000
I don't.

1100
01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:05.000
Yeah.

1101
01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:08.000
I'd rather, I'd rather have you recognize it, right?

1102
01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:12.000
I'd rather have you realize that there's a problem with that 40%.

1103
01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:15.000
Now, I might say something and just omit the 40%.

1104
01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:20.000
Like, when I first talked to you, and this 60% of this stuff will read that you're doing is awesome.

1105
01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:21.000
Yeah.

1106
01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:24.000
And I'm giving you the benefit of that out there. You're going to straighten out that out of the 40%.

1107
01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:25.000
Right?

1108
01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:25.000
Yeah.

1109
01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:28.000
Get out your ruler and get it straight.

1110
01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:29.000
Sure. Of course the ruler.

1111
01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000
But, so, okay. So technically, yeah.

1112
01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:35.000
So your whole campaign, yeah, is not false to your leading there.

1113
01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:35.000
No.

1114
01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:39.000
So it's like, but let's say you just stuck, let's say that for that first one.

1115
01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:40.000
That's step one.

1116
01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:41.000
Right?

1117
01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:41.000
Yeah.

1118
01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:42.000
That's a, it's a final five step.

1119
01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:46.000
So if you just stuck with step one, I guess it depends on the reason too, right?

1120
01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:49.000
So if I'm like, hey, great. This 60% is awesome.

1121
01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:53.000
And don't even mention the 40% because I don't want any conflict with that guy.

1122
01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:59.000
Or I'm scared to, you know, confront them or I'm scared for that that conversation.

1123
01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:04.000
What you should be realistically scared of is if you're doing, if you're bust in your ass to do that 60%

1124
01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:09.000
Great, and all I come into say, like, hey, this 60% is good, but the other 40% sucks.

1125
01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:13.000
I discourage you. And now you're like, I can't do anything right for Jockel.

1126
01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:16.000
So now you're, you're not 60% right. There's a good chance that you don't even get the 60% now.

1127
01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:20.000
You're going down to 50% and then 40% is good and 60% is bad.

1128
01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:20.000
Yeah.

1129
01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:23.000
I don't want that. I want you to be on board with the program.

1130
01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:28.000
I want you to be like, oh man, I could work a little bit more and work a little bit harder

1131
01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
and discipline myself a little bit better.

1132
01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:34.000
And I could actually get 70% and then let's see what Jockel comes in here and says

1133
01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
when he's all fired up that I did 60% and watch this.

1134
01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:44.000
Yeah. So this is a whole thing. So dank you could almost say, almost.

1135
01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:50.000
That false cheerleading, I guess, okay, I was going to say you could almost say false cheerleading

1136
01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:53.000
cheerleading actually has its little spot in a bigger campaign.

1137
01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:54.000
Can you use the campaign?

1138
01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:59.000
But I guess technically, if it is, it's a, by its very nature, if it's part of a big campaign,

1139
01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:05.000
it's not false cheerleading. It's just a, maybe, strategic, strategic maneuver.

1140
01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
Like, just think of a little kid.

1141
01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:11.000
Minutes is break it down to the fundamental realities of life.

1142
01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
A little kid.

1143
01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:20.000
If you take a little kid that does something, okay, let's say the kid tries to draw a rabbit.

1144
01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:21.000
Sure.

1145
01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:22.000
And what does it look like?

1146
01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
It looks like it doesn't even look like a mouse.

1147
01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
It really looks like a stick.

1148
01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:27.000
Right?

1149
01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:31.000
So if you say, if, okay, I'm not going to use false cheerleading.

1150
01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:34.000
Hey, kid, that doesn't look like a rabbit.

1151
01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:37.000
It looks like a stick fail.

1152
01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:40.000
Is that kid going to draw another rabbit?

1153
01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:41.000
Not going to want to.

1154
01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:42.000
Not going to want to.

1155
01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:47.000
If you say, oh, I really like that you try to see where the eyes should go.

1156
01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:48.000
You know what I mean?

1157
01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:51.000
And they get a little bit, they're like, oh, can I hang this up?

1158
01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
I'm going to hang this up on my refrigerator.

1159
01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:54.000
What?

1160
01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
What does that kid want to do now?

1161
01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:57.000
Draw more rabbit.

1162
01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:58.000
Do you know, yeah, even, like, yeah.

1163
01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:01.000
Does that translate directly to adults?

1164
01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:02.000
Oh, yes, it does.

1165
01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:03.000
It does.

1166
01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:04.000
It does.

1167
01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:05.000
Does it always translate 100%?

1168
01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:06.000
No, of course not.

1169
01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:07.000
It doesn't translate 100%.

1170
01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:10.000
But because there's some people that are, of course, there's some people I just try to

1171
01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:11.000
skate and do the minimum.

1172
01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:12.000
And if you say, like, hey, good job.

1173
01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:13.000
They're like, okay, cool.

1174
01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:14.000
Thanks.

1175
01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:15.000
Now I'm just going to keep doing whatever you told me.

1176
01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:20.000
But if you're, you know, again, for an extrategic or an campaign, we're trying to make things

1177
01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
happen, it's like, yeah, you know what?

1178
01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:25.000
Hey, echo man, that stuff.

1179
01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000
Picture the first time you ever made a video.

1180
01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:28.000
Yeah.

1181
01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:31.000
Imagine if I said, you know, I'm a little bit like, oh, I'm a little bit like, oh, I'm

1182
01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:37.000
like, you know, I mean, decent work, you know, not exactly eye grabbing though.

1183
01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000
Would you have been excited to make more videos?

1184
01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
Probably, yeah, probably not.

1185
01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:42.000
Yeah, yeah.

1186
01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
I mean, you'd probably be like, okay, whatever.

1187
01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
I guess, maybe this isn't for me.

1188
01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:47.000
Or maybe I won't make videos for this guy.

1189
01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:48.000
Yeah, for this guy.

1190
01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:49.000
Yeah, for this guy.

1191
01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:50.000
Yeah.

1192
01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
But if I was like, oh, man, I really liked the way that was some good effect.

1193
01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:53.000
That was, you know what I mean?

1194
01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:54.000
Yeah.

1195
01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:55.000
Then you go, oh, yeah.

1196
01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:56.000
I'm like, he's in the game with me.

1197
01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:57.000
Right.

1198
01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:58.000
Also in the weird team, we're not against each other.

1199
01:08:58.000 --> 01:08:59.000
Yeah.

1200
01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000
So I'm just trying to unify things and bring things together.

1201
01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:02.000
Yeah.

1202
01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:06.000
I might even come back to you to improve myself more with the wheels.

1203
01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:07.000
Hey, we think about this.

1204
01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000
Like, yeah, I had, yeah, we're a team now.

1205
01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:10.000
Yeah, that's a good way to do it.

1206
01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:14.000
My best leaders that I had, all I wanted to do is do better for them.

1207
01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:21.000
They, and they never, they might give me critique, but it was like the kind of critique that makes you feel guilty about being alive.

1208
01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:22.000
Yeah.

1209
01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:23.000
Right.

1210
01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:27.000
We're the kind of, like, really, really like this, you know.

1211
01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:31.000
I wish, you know, if we could do this a little bit more, man, that would be really nice.

1212
01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:35.000
I'm like, oh, man, I wish that better.

1213
01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:40.000
And then you have to also remember that people have different levels of sensitivities, right?

1214
01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:41.000
Yeah.

1215
01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:45.000
Because for you, like, especially when it's something that they would deeply care about,

1216
01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:46.000
Yeah.

1217
01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:50.000
When you critique them, there's almost no one that takes that critique well, right?

1218
01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:53.000
Oh, you want to tell me about, oh, you want to tell me about whatever.

1219
01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
I did this drawing, like a little kid, right?

1220
01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:56.000
The kid tries to do a good drawing.

1221
01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:57.000
Yeah.

1222
01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:00.000
You tell them that their drawings are no good, that breaks their heart.

1223
01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:01.000
Yeah.

1224
01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:02.000
Yes, it does.

1225
01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:03.000
Evil.

1226
01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:04.000
Yeah, man.

1227
01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
So, you're right.

1228
01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000
Is that false-chalating?

1229
01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
No, that's part of a campaign plan.

1230
01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
Is it good if the kid draws a stick?

1231
01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:15.000
And you like that's the most amazing drawing I've ever seen?

1232
01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000
Well, now what's, this is to life's point.

1233
01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000
If you, the kid draws a stick and it's supposed to be a rabbit.

1234
01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:22.000
And you go, that's the most amazing rabbit I've ever seen drawn.

1235
01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:25.000
Now, let me ask you this, is that kid going to try and improve it all?

1236
01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:32.000
No, and he'll probably not take criticism because they start getting used to like never having anything

1237
01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:33.000
I do is great.

1238
01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:38.000
And I think that one applies more to adults because when you say that to an adult, like, man,

1239
01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:39.000
that's the best thing I've ever seen.

1240
01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:40.000
They're like, oh, yeah.

1241
01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
They're a little bit more egotistic.

1242
01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:43.000
Yeah, they'll believe it more.

1243
01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:44.000
Yeah.

1244
01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:47.000
Little kids are like, well, like, kind of surprised if you tell them that.

1245
01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:48.000
It's supposed to be really, really believe you.

1246
01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:51.000
They look, I'm only six, but that's the stick as far as I'm concerned.

1247
01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000
I tried to make a rabbit.

1248
01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:57.000
I got an ear off there anyways after that.

1249
01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:58.000
I don't know.

1250
01:10:58.000 --> 01:10:59.000
Yeah.

1251
01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:00.000
Yeah.

1252
01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
I could see that T.S.

1253
01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:05.000
So, there you go.

1254
01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:08.000
Meanwhile, back in Korea.

1255
01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:09.000
Here's what's going on.

1256
01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000
They're under another attack.

1257
01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000
And as you can see, there's a little pattern developing.

1258
01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:14.000
It's just we're getting attacked.

1259
01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:15.000
We're getting attacked.

1260
01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:16.000
We're getting attacked.

1261
01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
That's what's going on.

1262
01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000
We could see the North Korean spawning over the hill.

1263
01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:24.000
The North Korean artillery fire followed K company down the hill.

1264
01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:27.000
The ground shook like an earthquake as the rounds walked towards us.

1265
01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000
I hugged the bottom of the side of the hole.

1266
01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:32.000
All I could think about was a round landing straight on top of me.

1267
01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
If that happened, I'd never know.

1268
01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:38.000
I pulled my helmet and gridded my teeth.

1269
01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
I was starting to lose it.

1270
01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:47.000
Now, again, this is just continuing to continue to get hammered.

1271
01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:48.000
And walls comes always.

1272
01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
Are we going to stay?

1273
01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:51.000
God dammit.

1274
01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000
Just stay in these holes until I tell you differently.

1275
01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:54.000
I race back to my hole.

1276
01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000
On the way, young Lieutenant ran by me.

1277
01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:57.000
He was scared.

1278
01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:00.000
He was so scared as voice cracked when he screamed at me.

1279
01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:01.000
Get out of here.

1280
01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:02.000
Fall back.

1281
01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:03.000
Who the hell are you?

1282
01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:04.000
I barked.

1283
01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
There were men still trying to get back.

1284
01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
And if we left, they wouldn't have a chance in hell.

1285
01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:13.000
So, his group is trying to provide cover fire for the groups that are now retreating.

1286
01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
He didn't stop and I never got his name.

1287
01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
He just yelled the fall back.

1288
01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:18.000
I told him, shit, I yelled at him.

1289
01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:19.000
We can't leave here.

1290
01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000
We have to help these men.

1291
01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:25.000
Yeah, this is, he's keeping order in this retreat.

1292
01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:30.000
Several other members of K-Company pass me following the Lieutenant.

1293
01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000
I saw some of my men getting out of their holes.

1294
01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:35.000
You sons of bitches get back in your goddamn holes.

1295
01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:36.000
I yelled.

1296
01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:37.000
Get back.

1297
01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:38.000
They scrambled back.

1298
01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000
Round started to crash around us again.

1299
01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000
I could hear the K-Company men scream.

1300
01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:43.000
A shrapnel shoured them.

1301
01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000
Slicing into their skin.

1302
01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:49.000
Larger pieces, punched holes in their chest or sheared off their limbs.

1303
01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:53.000
Their screams filled in the silence between the crashes of artillery shells.

1304
01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:57.000
I was not going to be able to control this fucking situation much longer.

1305
01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:01.000
Whilst just stared at me with a vacant look, don't lose it now.

1306
01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000
I thought, another barrage landed nearby.

1307
01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000
I put my head down.

1308
01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:06.000
My ears started ringing.

1309
01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:09.000
Smoke was down on the bottom of the hole again.

1310
01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:12.000
The artillery fire finally stopped.

1311
01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:15.000
The screaming for the medics began.

1312
01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000
Go check your men.

1313
01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000
I told wall shaking him out of his stupor.

1314
01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000
I headed over to Hall's position.

1315
01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000
He had the same vacant look as walls.

1316
01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:26.000
Men from K-Company were moving down the ridge, carrying the wounded.

1317
01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:29.000
Everybody was bleeding or bandaged.

1318
01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:34.000
I kept my men focused on the hill, waiting for the north Koreans to counter attack.

1319
01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:37.000
But they never came.

1320
01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
Neither did the artillery.

1321
01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:44.000
It wasn't long, and I was told the withdrawal off the hill.

1322
01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:57.000
He talks about the Korean augmentation to the US Army or Katusa program, K-A-T-U-S-A.

1323
01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
So Korean augmentation to the US Army.

1324
01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000
And this was like soldiers.

1325
01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:02.000
He describes it here.

1326
01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:08.000
Katusa soldiers were young men picked up in larger cities, given a couple weeks training in a sign to the American units.

1327
01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:12.000
Despite the language barriers, the Koreans fell right in line with the rest of us.

1328
01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:15.000
When we marched, they kept up when we fought.

1329
01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:18.000
They stood there ground too.

1330
01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:25.000
Over the next few days, we continued to attack to the west.

1331
01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:28.000
It was a knock-down drag-out slug fest.

1332
01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:32.000
The North Koreans attacked us with a band and tried to overwhelm us with numbers.

1333
01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:33.000
They were fanatical.

1334
01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:37.000
One regimental commander said after the war that the North Koreans had no consideration.

1335
01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:44.000
For the loss of life, they have no hesitancy in losing 500 lives to gain a small piece of ground.

1336
01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:50.000
It took us three more days to take two more North Korean positions.

1337
01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:56.000
We uncovered large ammunition caches and killed 72 in captured 200.

1338
01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:59.000
All at a great price.

1339
01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:04.000
I lost two more men and the company suffered a total of four killed with 13 wounded.

1340
01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:09.000
The losses reduced our strength to around 53 men.

1341
01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:15.000
But the enemy was now on the run and we held the river line.

1342
01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:18.000
The morale went sky high.

1343
01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:23.000
They turned to tables a little bit as they went on the attack and the counter offensive.

1344
01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:36.000
And then they're continuing to push and as they're heading down the road, all of a sudden North Korean machine guns started spraying the road.

1345
01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000
They had us in the open.

1346
01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:44.000
The North Koreans had us pin down and unable to push into the village, which is what their objective was.

1347
01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:47.000
I heard the rumbling first.

1348
01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:52.000
Peeking over the diek, I saw three Russian-made T-34 tanks.

1349
01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:58.000
I could tell they were T-34s because of the narrow turret that sat on top of the almost pyramid-shaped body.

1350
01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:04.000
The tanks had led the charge against Nazi Germany and World War II.

1351
01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:11.000
The T-34 dominated the German tanks because the Russian tanks could race over the deep mud and snow of the eastern front.

1352
01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:16.000
After the war, the Soviets sold them to their communist allies.

1353
01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:23.000
The North Korean invasion was spearheaded by T-34 tanks, but North Korean lead tank was almost on us.

1354
01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:28.000
It stopped and the main gun started to slowly turn in our direction.

1355
01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:34.000
I looked at the road and saw a bazooka gun or jump out of the rice paddy run to the middle of the road.

1356
01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:37.000
Stop, shoulder the tube, aimin' at the tank.

1357
01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000
I thought this guy must have nerves of steel.

1358
01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:42.000
It was a modern day David and Goliath.

1359
01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:47.000
WAM! The rocket smashed into the tank and bounced off.

1360
01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:53.000
The goddamn thing was a dud where the gunner was too close and the rocket did not have time to arm.

1361
01:16:53.000 --> 01:17:00.000
A burst from the tanks machine gun opened up and quickly cut the American gunner down.

1362
01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:04.000
I scrambled down the muddy dikes screaming at hegly to get the his gun up.

1363
01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:08.000
Machine gun rounds from the tanks gunner sprayed me with mud.

1364
01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000
Go for the treads I screamed.

1365
01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:16.000
I watched hegly's assistant gunner slide around into the 57 on his shoulder and tap him on the helmet.

1366
01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:19.000
I slid to a stop and buried my head in my hands.

1367
01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:24.000
I felt the concussion before I heard the round race by and hit the tank.

1368
01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:30.000
The armored Hulk tried to shake off the blast, but when it moved I watched the tread roll off the wheels.

1369
01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:35.000
The turret still worked and I could see it moved back and forth searching for targets.

1370
01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:40.000
Staying out of the North Korean sites, I motioned a wall to get his gun on the second tank.

1371
01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:43.000
In minutes I heard another blast from the 57.

1372
01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:53.000
Soon the two tanks unable to get there by their crippled mate, reversed and headed back to the village.

1373
01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:58.000
Just taking out tanks with bazookas.

1374
01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:01.000
Unbelievable.

1375
01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:05.000
The next morning we started out toward the hill in the village.

1376
01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:10.000
A thick early morning fog hung low over the rice patties visibility was zero.

1377
01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:15.000
We were stiff wet and very anxious as we started moving toward the objective.

1378
01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:20.000
Up ahead I saw soldiers walk through the North Korean positions and continue toward the village.

1379
01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:24.000
Climbing like the last dike we ran up on a road covered in North Korean bodies.

1380
01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:27.000
They were in a heap torn apart by shrapnel.

1381
01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:31.000
Mules and broken equipment sat motionless nearby.

1382
01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:35.000
Body parts were strewn on both sides of the road.

1383
01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:39.000
A saw men lying dead and still chained to the machine guns they were pulling.

1384
01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:43.000
As the fog lifted the site became even more gruesome.

1385
01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:48.000
Our artillery had caught them trying to withdraw.

1386
01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:54.000
The same scene played over and over again as we moved up the road into the village.

1387
01:18:54.000 --> 01:19:00.000
We didn't face a fight taking this position.

1388
01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:03.000
Every mile we moved north, my outlook changed.

1389
01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:06.000
The whole section looked and acted more self-confident.

1390
01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.000
When we got into a fight we enjoyed it.

1391
01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:12.000
The killing was quickly becoming revend rather than necessity.

1392
01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:16.000
Rather than necessity to gain ground and drive the North Koreans out.

1393
01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000
We were still being killed.

1394
01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:23.000
Only now we were the aggressors and they were dying in their holes.

1395
01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:29.000
I knew we were better fighters and had held them under tremendous odds.

1396
01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:35.000
Now the tables were turned and they did not have the will or resolve to accomplish what we had and

1397
01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:38.000
Pruson during the darkest days of summer.

1398
01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:45.000
The momentum has kind of changed and these guys are feeling good about the whole situation.

1399
01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:54.000
There is something good and something that feels good about being on offense.

1400
01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:58.000
This confidence continues as they continue to advance.

1401
01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:03.000
Early the next morning we were back on foot advancing toward the North Koreans behind the three American tanks.

1402
01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:10.000
We were receiving heavy artillery fire and trying to stay close to the tanks hoping the army would shield us from the strappin'

1403
01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:16.000
final flying through the air.

1404
01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.000
One second I was looking back to make sure Walsh's squad was keeping up and the next I was stunned.

1405
01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:22.000
A shell landed on the tank, sending strappin' and fire into the air.

1406
01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:26.000
The explosion was deafening and I stumbled back, dazed.

1407
01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:31.000
Falling down in the tracks behind the tank, I saw the crew crawling out of the escape hatch.

1408
01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:36.000
Machine gun fire was kicking up dirt all around me as I hugged the ground.

1409
01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:42.000
I could see two tankers lying under the tank. They were wounded and couldn't crawl away from the Hulk.

1410
01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:48.000
Walsh I screamed, helped me get these guys. A couple of artillery rounds net landed on the road.

1411
01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:52.000
I felt a sharp hop pain in my left shoulder.

1412
01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:56.000
You alright? Walsh asked, has he raised to my side?

1413
01:20:56.000 --> 01:21:02.000
Yeah. I said shaking my head tried to reassure him. I didn't have time to worry about it.

1414
01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:08.000
The machine gun rounds pinged off the armor as I crawled underneath the tank and grabbed one of the tankers by his collar.

1415
01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:12.000
Pain shot through my arm and my shoulder felt hot and weak.

1416
01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:19.000
I let go but hung on with my good hand. Walsh grabbed the other tanker and we dragged the pair into it nearby ditch.

1417
01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:23.000
Medic, medic I screamed.

1418
01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:29.000
So this again there's a heroism after heroism after heroism in this book.

1419
01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:34.000
And I brought bring up some of them but I don't bring up all of them because we just don't have.

1420
01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:38.000
I'm not going to read the whole book. You got to buy the book.

1421
01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:44.000
Continuing. I squatted down and tried to take off my gear and jackets to the medic could get to the wound.

1422
01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:48.000
Because obviously you got hit in the shoulder. My left hand shook as I peeled off the shirt.

1423
01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:56.000
Now a few shades darker from the blood. The medic arrived with Walsh. He wiped away the blood with a lot of gauze and started to bandage the gash.

1424
01:21:56.000 --> 01:22:01.000
It was on the backside of my shoulder and I couldn't see the wound.

1425
01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:10.000
A few pieces of shrapnel the medic said you can move it right. Probably nothing torn or broken.

1426
01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:16.000
So now he's wounded. It's not too severe.

1427
01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:25.000
Not exactly a good deal though. You think about you think about you're in an athletic competition which is what this is.

1428
01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:28.000
And on top of that there's a massive amount of mental stress.

1429
01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:35.000
And on top of that you got to make decisions. And on top of that you get you get a big gash in your shoulder.

1430
01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:40.000
A couple days later we were we sat overlooking the 38th parallel.

1431
01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:44.000
We'd push the North Koreans back now in a way to order us to attack.

1432
01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:48.000
Sitting in my foxhole I watched as the full moon began to rise.

1433
01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:53.000
I got the feeling that there was something safe and secure as it washed gently over us.

1434
01:22:53.000 --> 01:23:00.000
I felt like God was protecting us or surely trying to help at least he'd kept me alive.

1435
01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:08.000
Even though my shoulder throbbed. If only we were back home we could all go to sleep under the moon's calming light

1436
01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:17.000
and wake up safe to the warmth of the sun.

1437
01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:25.000
Now that shoulder wound that he kind of blew off actually is not all that good. He starts getting a little.

1438
01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:31.000
Starts getting a little infection in it passes out from it. I woke up this time they carried me back to the battalion's aid station.

1439
01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:34.000
The medic set the stretcher on a dirt floor.

1440
01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.000
Dr. comes in. You're lucky.

1441
01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:40.000
Had you waited in the longer the infection would have spread.

1442
01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:47.000
Some time goes by the next day I felt fine. The doctors had me on a yellow diet.

1443
01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:51.000
So when the doctor came on his rounds I told him I wanted to leave.

1444
01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:55.000
I need to go back to my unit. I said.

1445
01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.000
Typical fashion.

1446
01:23:57.000 --> 01:24:02.000
The American doughboy, the American grunt.

1447
01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:07.000
They get wounded. What do they want to do? They want to go back with their team.

1448
01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:11.000
And that's exactly what he does.

1449
01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:15.000
And a couple days later he gets back with his unit.

1450
01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:18.000
And of course what are they doing? They're going on attack.

1451
01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:24.000
And as they're going on attack back to the book all of a sudden there was a thunderous roar as an artillery barrage hit us.

1452
01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:28.000
I was blown straight up in the air. My feet were over my head.

1453
01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:33.000
I came down on my shoulder in my head. The mud softened the blow.

1454
01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:37.000
Grabbing my helmet I yelled for my section to run forward out of the kill zone.

1455
01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:41.000
Three guys in front of me and two behind me were wounded.

1456
01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:49.000
I could hear the moaning as they clutch their stomachs and legs.

1457
01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:53.000
I checked myself. I escaped without a scratch.

1458
01:24:53.000 --> 01:25:01.000
Medix hurried to the downmen. I looked back and saw heatly standing days to get moving I yelled.

1459
01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:05.000
He looked at me with a funny expression on his face and looked down at his waist.

1460
01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:08.000
He'd been hit by shrapnel and the stomach.

1461
01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:13.000
I could see the blood soaking through his fatigues. I'm hit rich.

1462
01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:17.000
Get down. I said and I hollered medic.

1463
01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:21.000
He glee fell to his knees and rolled over onto his back.

1464
01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:27.000
I was torn. I wanted to run to him but I had to keep the rest of the section moving.

1465
01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:32.000
There was one of those choices that you never want to make.

1466
01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:37.000
I saw the medics coming and turned to join the other men.

1467
01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:41.000
Good luck buddy. See you later. I screamed over my shoulder.

1468
01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:48.000
I couldn't look back but I knew. I'd probably never see heatly again.

1469
01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:52.000
A stomach wound. I thought Jesus Christ. I hope he makes it.

1470
01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:58.000
I wanted to sit down and cry but this was not the time or place for that.

1471
01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:02.000
I had damn near lost a whole squad.

1472
01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:14.000
There was only one way to go at the hill so now they're trying to take the hill.

1473
01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:18.000
There's only one way to go at the hill and it was straight forward.

1474
01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:23.000
I looked across the open space we were going to cross. There was little cover.

1475
01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:29.000
This was going to be tough. There was no time to dwell on heagly or our dwindling numbers.

1476
01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:34.000
The longer we sat behind the rail rolled in beg meant the tougher it would be to get started.

1477
01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:39.000
Braums are waiting to get artillery support. The same guys I had dinner with.

1478
01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:42.000
I hope they remembered what I told them and come through.

1479
01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:49.000
Leaning back against the embankment I saw Alan and the Korean hustling across the field, each carrying two pack boards with ammo.

1480
01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:54.000
Get ready Braums are said. I gripped my rifle and closed my eyes.

1481
01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:59.000
My mind knew going forward was crazy but I willed my legs to move.

1482
01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:03.000
Soon I was running and leading the rest of the section across the patties.

1483
01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:07.000
Mortar and artillery fire crashed around me but I didn't notice.

1484
01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:10.000
I only saw the flashes of the North Korean machine guns ahead of me.

1485
01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:16.000
I stayed close to Mac. I could hear him hollering to add his squad to move.

1486
01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:22.000
To my right I saw that wall was right beside us. He had his squad moving.

1487
01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:29.000
It all seemed almost normal. It was just another day, another attack.

1488
01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:35.000
So you're getting mortar and artillery fire crashing all around you but you're not paying attention to that.

1489
01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:42.000
I'm really paying attention to the dam muzzle flashes from the Korean machine guns at a right in front of you.

1490
01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:49.000
When they they danned up pulling off that attack and again get the books so you can get some of those details.

1491
01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:55.000
When the attack is complete he writes I was not a religious person but I felt like one that day.

1492
01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:59.000
I gave thanks with walls for our gift of life.

1493
01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:05.000
After services that evening we turned in our basic load of ammunition.

1494
01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:09.000
Another sure sign that it was over.

1495
01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:16.000
So just to rehash that last little statement they're turning in their ammunition because they're getting a positive feeling like they've been doing this good fighting.

1496
01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:26.000
They've been on a pursuit. They were kind of on the defensive in the beginning and now they go back on the counter attack and now they're feeling pretty good and now they get hey you know what you can turn in your ammunition.

1497
01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.000
Think about that.

1498
01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:34.000
But back to the book that night we got orders to move but not home.

1499
01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:38.000
We were headed north to the town of Ushan.

1500
01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:44.000
I was a corporal when we arrived in Korea now less than sixty seven days later.

1501
01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:52.000
I was going to be a master sergeant the army's highest non-commissioned officers rank.

1502
01:28:52.000 --> 01:29:00.000
The promotions couldn't have come at a better time with the war winding down. I was sure this would be the last of the fast promotions.

1503
01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:07.000
So he's actually again these guys think that they're doing a good job and they kind of think that things are heading in their direction.

1504
01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:13.000
And yeah, 1950 I mean we know just from history that this war is not even close to over yet.

1505
01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:18.000
And yeah, but that's the weather feeling.

1506
01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:23.000
And can you imagine I mean he's at the highest he's a master sergeant right now.

1507
01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:26.000
Sixty seven days he got promoted through all the ranks.

1508
01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:36.000
That's how many guys that's how many guys were wounded or killed that they needed him to be promoted to run these units.

1509
01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:42.000
So they now get sent into a position where they're holding a bridge.

1510
01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:51.000
While they're holding this bridge, he sent a couple guys out on a recon to take a look around and they come back and he says, what the hell is that? I asked him.

1511
01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:55.000
It's just an old glove and a shovel. It's all wet. It's probably been there for weeks.

1512
01:29:55.000 --> 01:30:00.000
He said in a defiant tone and that's one of the guys that were on the recon talking. That was on the recon talking.

1513
01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:05.000
They didn't look like any glove I had seen before it was large and padded.

1514
01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:10.000
What else did you find I shot back? Just some old positions nothing to worry about.

1515
01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:15.000
I was a little concerned now and continued to quism on how many holes there were up there.

1516
01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:20.000
Around five or six the sergeant said, was the dirt wet or dry?

1517
01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:23.000
God dammit I don't know. He was pitch black.

1518
01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:28.000
I'm telling you there's nothing up on that fucking hill. The smug sergeant snapped at me.

1519
01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:36.000
You can guess what's coming. You find a shovel up there. Guess what's going on. They're digging in. That's what's going on. They're digging in.

1520
01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:44.000
These gloves, these kind of heavy gloves probably resupply from the Chinese. That's why they didn't recognize them.

1521
01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:52.000
They hadn't really encountered the Chinese yet. That were about to attack in massive numbers.

1522
01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:54.000
Back to the book.

1523
01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:58.000
Around 4am the hill erupted.

1524
01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:06.000
Four machine guns from the high hills on the south end of the bridge opened up two guns cross firing on each end of the bridge.

1525
01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:15.000
The tracers from the machine gun were skipping off the concrete like firecrackers. My guys quickly man the 57 recorulus rifle and got off a few rounds.

1526
01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:17.000
It did little.

1527
01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:24.000
Immediately we started getting hit with mortar fire. My radio was shot up and I tried to get the company on the landline but it was out too.

1528
01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:32.000
My mind was on my men. I lost two in the opening barrage and I had lost track of the two men on the south side of the bridge.

1529
01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:36.000
This attack didn't make sense too much firepower for a few stragglers.

1530
01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:40.000
So he's again looking back to the recon report that he got.

1531
01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:47.000
It looked like the 4th of July fireworks as tracers skipped off the concrete but I soon realized that some of the fire was coming from our left flank.

1532
01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:51.000
Jesus Christ it was our own company firing at us.

1533
01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:57.000
So we got a little blue on blue going down which again for folks that are in the military.

1534
01:31:57.000 --> 01:32:00.000
Blue on blue is a real thing.

1535
01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:04.000
And if you don't pay attention and you don't plan for it can absolutely happen to you.

1536
01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:08.000
You know, lay foot saying that the other day. If you would have asked him before we went on deployment.

1537
01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:13.000
One of the chances that you're involved in a blue on blue situation.

1538
01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:17.000
The following on deployment, lay foot even like no chance that would never happen to us.

1539
01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:18.000
And during deployment.

1540
01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:25.000
There was there was the I think we talked about three blue on blue possibilities were one real.

1541
01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:29.000
And then two possibilities in the extreme ownership.

1542
01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:32.000
And you know, one is the opening story of blue on blue.

1543
01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:33.000
One is.

1544
01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:38.000
Lave with Chris Kyle who's getting ready to take a shot and you know,

1545
01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:40.000
Lave is basically getting asked.

1546
01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:45.000
Hey take that guy out and Lave puts the brakes on it and it turns out being friendly US Army soldiers.

1547
01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:53.000
And then one where I got guys on the rooftop of a building and there's a Bradley fighting vehicle that's one to engage it with 25 millimeter chain gun.

1548
01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:58.000
And they're looking they're reporting that they're looking at one building.

1549
01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:06.000
But they're actually looking and I'm and all indications are yes, you can engage those are enemy snipers on that rooftop take them out.

1550
01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:10.000
But on the same block a few buildings down.

1551
01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:20.000
And he was actually considered was actually like probably a couple blocks away was my guys and that gunner in that Bradley that was reporting it.

1552
01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:24.000
He just got a little bit off on which building was which building.

1553
01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:29.000
Oh yeah, so he was actually pointing at one building and just thought he was pointing.

1554
01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:34.000
He's looking through they've really good imagery on those buildings, especially the thermo.

1555
01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:36.000
So you can see like white hot.

1556
01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:40.000
And he's looking at a building down this long street and he's reporting out.

1557
01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:47.000
I don't I'd for you with the buildings were but the building he's you know reporting building 50 I got enemy any personnel on the rooftop.

1558
01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:50.000
And my guys were in building 100.

1559
01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:54.000
So he's asking does anyone have any true you know any friendly troops in building 50.

1560
01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:55.000
No no no.

1561
01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:56.000
No.

1562
01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:57.000
Has any troops in building 50.

1563
01:33:57.000 --> 01:34:01.000
Oh there's there's enemy with with scope weapons there.

1564
01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:05.000
And everyone's thinking hey this is the sniper that's been killing our guys by the way.

1565
01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.000
Let's take him out.

1566
01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:17.000
And then looking at the yeah and what I actually told him to do I was like hey before and and the reason I I was heads up was because we had below on blue.

1567
01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:19.000
I knew that this was a possibility.

1568
01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:25.000
So I said count the buildings from your intersection up to the target building.

1569
01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:28.000
And so that it just went quiet for a little while.

1570
01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:32.000
And he comes back as extend by because he caught himself you know.

1571
01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:38.000
He's you can see on the battle map it's like okay one two three four five six seven.

1572
01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:46.000
And that's what whatever he gets to twelve he's like oh wait I'm in the wrong spot and you realize that this is I got you know so still down.

1573
01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:51.000
But yeah you don't want to be on rooftop getting hit with 50 or 25 millimeter chain gun from a Bradley fighting vehicle.

1574
01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:54.000
It's not going to be a good situation at all.

1575
01:34:54.000 --> 01:35:01.000
And so the same thing's going on here you got fire flight going on at night you got troops moving around and these guys are getting lit up by their own men.

1576
01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:10.000
All kinds of ways tactically to deconflick these things but you have to pay attention to you and one of the things you have to do is you have to have the.

1577
01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:14.000
Humility to recognize that it can actually happen.

1578
01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:16.000
Yeah.

1579
01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:27.000
Back to the book the Koreans were all over the place Mac was hit worse than he's thought I could feel his back it was drenched in blood he started to choke I talked to him but he didn't answer.

1580
01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:33.000
I laid him down and at the same time hauled to the rest of the men to pull and tighter around the road.

1581
01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:39.000
I had four men left our two jeeps were shot up one was on fire.

1582
01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:48.000
I knew at this point we could not hold the bridge get the breach get the breach block from the 57 and throw it in the river I yelled to my guys.

1583
01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:52.000
So so that's sort of like.

1584
01:35:52.000 --> 01:36:02.000
That's like one of those when you make that call right there which is disabled our weapon permanently because we're going to not make it.

1585
01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:14.000
We don't want the enemy to be able to use this when make capture it in a matter of minutes that's what he's saying is you know get the breach block out and throw it in the river.

1586
01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:33.000
And then of course the North Koreans attacked again and got within 20 feet before we stopped them. I rushed to the other side of the road and got slammed to the ground from an explosion confused I stumbled into a nearby ditch my head was ringing I checked Mac he was dead and so were the other two men on his side of the road.

1587
01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:42.000
With only two men left we had to leave the bridge I shoved the grenade in the breach of the 57 the grenade exploded destroying the gun.

1588
01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:52.000
And we started pushing up the ditch away from the bridge I couldn't see or hear anything.

1589
01:36:52.000 --> 01:37:03.000
We had not gone very far when the point man told me someone was coming down the ditch toward us I took a knee and re-edit my rifle hold your fire until they get closer I whispered.

1590
01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:14.000
The point man yelled quickly back, serge their own guys, two of them from battalion come over here what's going on I barked them.

1591
01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:24.000
The men looked crazed both were talking a mile a minute and I tried to settle them down look take it easy I told them slowly tell me what you know.

1592
01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:34.000
The battalion got hit they were in the headquarters before we knew it the whole damn place was a mess one of the soldiers said.

1593
01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:41.000
There were dead and wounded all over everything was shot up it looked like an artillery barrage made a direct hit it was total chaos.

1594
01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:48.000
What are you two trying to do I asked they said they were trying to make contact with someone.

1595
01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:58.000
Sergeant on Taylor one of Walsers men the other guys from first battalion in the dark I didn't recognize him where's Walsh.

1596
01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:09.000
They're all dead serge Taylor said.

1597
01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:27.000
So they make movement towards that battalion headquarters area and there's still some friendlies there we stumbled into the battalion headquarters area and I introduced myself and asked Jones what the situation was it was not good.

1598
01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:40.000
There were thirty or forty wounded or dead doc Anderson in the chaplain and are in the command post trying to take care of the wounded.

1599
01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:48.000
Jones thought the battalion commander was dead they just walked in on them and shot up the whole damn place.

1600
01:38:48.000 --> 01:39:00.000
So at this point they kind of ziggy out of there into a tree line and we got into the wood line and threw ourselves to the ground completely exhausted.

1601
01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:10.000
And from there the chaplain moved onto another position but before he left he told me we were fighting the Chinese.

1602
01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:18.000
We heard rumors about the Chinese soldiers coming over the border that pretty much confirmed what I had fought for the last couple of hours.

1603
01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:25.000
Jones basically told me when he mentioned that their quilted uniform jackets looked much different than the North Koreans.

1604
01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:40.000
First Lieutenant Phil Peterson and Walt Mayo had also scrambled into our perimeter both officers were artillery forward observers but had lost their radios in the confusion.

1605
01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:56.000
The Chinese soldiers had crossed the Yalu to protect electrical generators along the river. That night Peterson had seen a Chinese prisoner in his quilted jacket but had no idea the danger we were in.

1606
01:39:56.000 --> 01:40:09.000
We had been ordered back to the battalion and then tried to escape when artillery unit tried to save their own hoursers. But the Chinese had already cut the road.

1607
01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:12.000
We were trapped.

1608
01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:25.000
We set up our defenses. We knew the Chinese would come for us that night. So that's it right now they're surrounded.

1609
01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:35.000
They set up a perimeter to the best of their ability and they got a bunch of wounded. They're low on ammunition. They're low on food. They're low on water.

1610
01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:43.000
So a perimeter is basically for those that don't know you set up 360 degree security perimeter. You dig some foxholes. You put machine guns pointing out.

1611
01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:53.000
It's your last stand situation now. It doesn't always last end because when you're on a normal patrol you set up perimeter. Any time you stop you set up 360 degree security.

1612
01:40:53.000 --> 01:41:09.000
And in this situation that's what they're doing. They're set up their perimeter to the best of their ability with what they've got left and then there's a little command post in the center of the perimeter. And here we go back to the book inside the command post. I knew what the officers were talking about.

1613
01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:12.000
It was a forbidden subject.

1614
01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:22.000
What were we going to do with the wounded in the terrible final moment that everyone knew is coming.

1615
01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:31.000
Italian surgeon, doc Anderson and the chaplain were doing what they could for about 40 wounded men. But we couldn't hold out for long without a relief column.

1616
01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:47.000
Meaning people coming to back them up. And if we had to run the wounded officers were going to have to decide whether or not to leave themselves and the other wounded men behind to the mercies of the enemy.

1617
01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:58.000
And once he kind of hears that inside the center of the perimeter during the at the command post there he goes back out to his edge of the perimeter.

1618
01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:04.000
And then here we go back to the book. I saw a group of 20 men running right at us.

1619
01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:11.000
They were Americans and we're hallowing and waving at us. I prayed they were the lead element of a relief column.

1620
01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:17.000
Because of course they're here in rumors that someone's going to come. There's there's friendly on the way. That's what they're getting. They're kind of.

1621
01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:27.000
And I wasn't clear where they were getting those rumors from or whether they were just assuming like hey we're here Americans are going to come to get us.

1622
01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:30.000
They've got to be sending a relief battalion. We just need to hang on.

1623
01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:35.000
So that's what he's saying. I prayed that they were the lead element of a relief column.

1624
01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:43.000
The other guys were cheering them on as they made the short dash to our trench. They slid inside their chest. Chess heaving.

1625
01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:47.000
What unit are you guys from I asked?

1626
01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:53.000
Second of the eighth an officer said between deep breaths.

1627
01:42:53.000 --> 01:43:01.000
The stragglers pushed by us and collapsed in the center of the perimeter. Everyone's morale sank lower than whale shit.

1628
01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:09.000
The energy and excitement seemed to deflate from the men in the trench and all at once their heads hung and shoulders dipped.

1629
01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:17.000
These guys weren't a relief column. They were just more stragglers from the second battalion.

1630
01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:33.000
I couldn't shake the thought that no one was coming for us.

1631
01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:41.000
There's a soldier that he talks about a Polish guy. I mean American guy but of Polish descent last name's a wallock.

1632
01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:49.000
Later that day, well, I saw another in their perimeter. Later that day wallock sent for me. I walked across the west side of the perimeter and saw him standing near a machine gun position.

1633
01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:55.000
He looked concerned and started pointing out towards what looked like an open field.

1634
01:43:55.000 --> 01:44:01.000
Look over there, he said. I watched where he was pointing. I didn't see anything.

1635
01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:07.000
I looked at him and shrug my soldiers. No, keep looking. He said this time staring intently.

1636
01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:13.000
Then I saw it. A faint shovelful of dirt flying right into the air.

1637
01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:21.000
The little bastards were digging a trench. They were about a half dozen or so digging a path right for us.

1638
01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:29.000
Our machine guns had been keeping them at a distance but when their trench was done, they could move under cover right up to the edge of our trenches.

1639
01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:37.000
So that's a determined enemy. They're just going to spend all day digging toward you.

1640
01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:45.000
As clandestine as they can but they can only keep it so clandestine and no one will only only one soldier noticed.

1641
01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:53.000
Back to the book, sunset was a bad time. Night always meant another attack.

1642
01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:57.000
It started with a probe. A few Chinese soldiers would move up to the perimeter followed by a short violent firefight.

1643
01:44:57.000 --> 01:45:11.000
Shortly after the probe, the artillery and mortar fire would start followed by the demonic ball of brass bugles and whistles as the Chinese infantry attacked.

1644
01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:15.000
The now he's talking about his guys. The men looked at me with weary, entire dyes.

1645
01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:23.000
All of us had scruffy beards and our skin was caked with mud and blood. None of the soldiers could look at me.

1646
01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:29.000
They knew that they wouldn't survive unless they got up and fought but they just sat there.

1647
01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:35.000
They were not cowards just frozen by fear. For some, this was their first taste of combat.

1648
01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:41.000
Boys who overnight were forced to become men. I could only imagine the terror they must have been through.

1649
01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:43.000
Must have been going through.

1650
01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:46.000
You've got two choices. I yelled.

1651
01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:51.000
Get up and get to the line or I'll shoot you.

1652
01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:55.000
That shocked them into action. I don't think they thought I would shoot them.

1653
01:45:55.000 --> 01:46:03.000
I had no sooner finish prodding the men out of their interior holes than one hell of a fight took place at the Batayan command post.

1654
01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:09.000
I knew there were mostly wounded soldiers there and I feared for Jones the lone man on the machine gun.

1655
01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:15.000
But I had my own problems. The bugles and whistles broke the silence and the Chinese rushed the east side of our perimeter.

1656
01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:19.000
They came in waves straight into our fire.

1657
01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:23.000
As quickly as they fell more appeared.

1658
01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:25.000
They moved into our fire like they were possessed.

1659
01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:29.000
I raced from trench to trench moving men where the Chinese concentrated their attack.

1660
01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:35.000
When they were attacked on the east side slowed, they launched an attack on the west side.

1661
01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:37.000
Although we were dug in our casualties, we're mounting.

1662
01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:45.000
I kept moving men to where the most Chinese were concentrated. The attack slowed down but it was not long before they began an assault on the west side of the perimeter.

1663
01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:49.000
Now they get this idea as these attack were taken place.

1664
01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:51.000
There's these trucks that were there.

1665
01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:57.000
Kind of abandoned trucks and they figure it's night time if they can set these trucks on fire.

1666
01:46:57.000 --> 01:47:01.000
They'll allow them to see the enemy.

1667
01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:05.000
And so that's what they do. They want one of these attack starts.

1668
01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:13.000
They shot the gas tanks and then shot tracers until all the vehicles were on fire.

1669
01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:17.000
When the Chinese infantry men ran past, we could see them silhouetted against the light.

1670
01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:25.000
It was a shooting gallery. We cut down the first wave only to watch the next one's climb over their comrades and keep coming.

1671
01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:29.000
We mowed down the next wave, but they still kept coming.

1672
01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:33.000
For the rest of the night, the Chinese came at us like waves to the shore.

1673
01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:37.000
But each time we stopped them, they never reached the perimeter.

1674
01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:40.000
The next morning we took stock of our situation.

1675
01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:46.000
Water and food were a problem, but ammunition and the wounded were our biggest concern.

1676
01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:52.000
We had 85 able-bodied men left out of about 200.

1677
01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:56.000
The rest were dead or wounded.

1678
01:47:56.000 --> 01:48:04.000
We were also out of morphine and the screams of the wounded were starting to have an impact on the rest of the men.

1679
01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:08.000
I could see in their eyes a tired, haggard look.

1680
01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:12.000
A relief column is coming for us. They'll get through today.

1681
01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:14.000
I told the men as I walked the line.

1682
01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:18.000
I said it over and over again, hoping to climb them.

1683
01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:22.000
And as I realized in hindsight, probably hoping to convince myself.

1684
01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:26.000
I hope to hell I was right.

1685
01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:36.000
Now, this is just a little report again about Chaplain Coplan.

1686
01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:40.000
He gets a report.

1687
01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:42.000
Richardson gets a report.

1688
01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:46.000
And it says this, the doc said that when the Chinese got into the dugout,

1689
01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:50.000
Chaplain Coplan stopped them from killing all the wounded by surrendering himself.

1690
01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:54.000
The Chinese took him and 15 of the walking wounded,

1691
01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:58.000
including my old company commander Captain McAbee.

1692
01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:02.000
What Coplan did was heroic stopping the Chinese.

1693
01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:06.000
When he left, he was carrying Sergeant Miller.

1694
01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:12.000
So Chaplain Coplan just once again, heroic actions,

1695
01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:16.000
saving the lives of these guys before they were slaughtered by the Chinese,

1696
01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:20.000
by surrendering himself.

1697
01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:28.000
When I got back, I organized about a dozen guys to follow me out of the perimeter and gather up some of the Chinese weapons and ammunition.

1698
01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:34.000
We were out of almost everything, but lying in front of us were weapons and ammunition, including much needed grenades.

1699
01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:38.000
Before we left, I told the men to be careful because some of the Chinese might still be alive.

1700
01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:44.000
It was gruesome business, but the only solution to our most pressing problem.

1701
01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:48.000
Crawling over piles of dead Chinese, the smell was overpowering.

1702
01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:54.000
At time, I could hear gas, seep out of the decaying corpses.

1703
01:49:54.000 --> 01:50:00.000
I could hear men behind me gag and throw up.

1704
01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:12.000
Yeah, so this is like, you got to sit around, you got to imagine what this is like, that they are the Chinese attackers are literally stacked and piled on top of one another.

1705
01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:18.000
And you're so low that you have to go out and gather weapons and ammunition from them.

1706
01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:34.000
And as you're doing that, their bloated bodies are giving off gases, and it's smell so horrible, and the whole scene is so horrific, that your men are dry-heaving and throwing up as you're trying to do this.

1707
01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:46.000
Back to the book. For the rest of the morning, we passed out our new trove of ammunition and dug in deeper.

1708
01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:49.000
As we worked, I heard the faint buzz of an airplane overhead.

1709
01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:57.000
The spotter plane that had dropped a bag of medical supplies was back, so I skipped over this part, but they got some medical supplies from a little plane.

1710
01:50:57.000 --> 01:51:05.000
And this time, instead of dropping supplies, it dropped the message. And this time, the pilot dropped it on target.

1711
01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:11.000
Guru, Guru, open the message. That's one of the one of the other guys, Guru.

1712
01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:17.000
I hope I'm pronouncing that right. G-I-R-O-U-X-G-R-O, open the message.

1713
01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:21.000
I saw the color leave as face.

1714
01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:32.000
I knew what the message said before he told me. We were on our own. No relief column was on its way. Our new order was simple.

1715
01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:37.000
We needed to get back to friendly lines the best way we could.

1716
01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:43.000
While Guru got the officers together, I gathered up a few of the sergeants and we had a meeting.

1717
01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:53.000
Well, we are on our own. That message told us to get back the best way we can. I told the sergeants.

1718
01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:57.000
While I was the first one to speak up, we can't just leave the wounded. What the hell else were we going to do with sergeant I didn't recognize said.

1719
01:51:57.000 --> 01:52:07.000
The meeting was tense. I realized that what I had been telling them was going to happen wasn't going to. No relief. No rescue.

1720
01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:17.000
And if we stayed in this hellhole, we would all die. I don't think we can keep the Chinese out of the perimeter for one more than one more night.

1721
01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:27.000
If we can even do that, I said. There was silence. We were facing death, but bravery is a funny thing.

1722
01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:33.000
It comes in all shapes and sizes and appears in men you would at least expect it from.

1723
01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:41.000
Most of us didn't know one another, but we fought hard together like we would blood brothers.

1724
01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:47.000
What do you say about staying one more night? Maybe somehow they will break through to us tomorrow.

1725
01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:59.000
I said tomorrow. We talk about the wounded. Wallach nodded his head and looked at the others. I'm for staying one more night.

1726
01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:07.000
Everyone quickly agreed. No one wanted to leave the wounded. I told Grow the way the men felt.

1727
01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:17.000
And after he met with bronzer male and Peterson they all agreed. No one was comfortable leaving our wounded or the wounded nearby in the battalion headquarters.

1728
01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:27.000
The Chinese, that night the Chinese attacked three times and three times we held, but not without suffering more casualties.

1729
01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:35.000
After the last attack I literally fell into a hole near the center of the perimeter. I was fighting a losing battle against sleep.

1730
01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:43.000
I could feel myself slipping away. My body felt numb, damp and heavy.

1731
01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:53.000
There was no noise, no sound. I was paralyzed in the hard drive tried to move. The more I felt, the more my body felt like stone.

1732
01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:59.000
I tried to scream. Nothing. I tried harder. I couldn't make a sound.

1733
01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:11.000
Bugles in the distance cleared my hazy mind. I could hear the burp burp of Chinese submachine guns, but the cop, but not the constant rattle of our own machine gun closest to me.

1734
01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:17.000
I instantly got a sick feeling. I bolted out of the trench and crawled toward the machine gun position and fell into the hole head first.

1735
01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:25.000
The gunner was wounded and the assistant gunner was trying to put the gun back in action. There was ammo, but the gun was jammed.

1736
01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:35.000
I racked it back, nothing. The head space was screwed up. The Chinese were within 20 yards of us, and I was screaming for the men to keep firing.

1737
01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:43.000
I pulled the gun into the hole and started to take it apart. I adjusted the head space, put the barrel in chamber and alignment, and reassembled it.

1738
01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:49.000
The A gunner, the assistant gunner, laid the ammo belt in and slapped the cover down.

1739
01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:57.000
I racked the bolt back and pulled the trigger. The gun jumped back to life. The fire immediately had an impact and drove a wedge into the advancing soldiers.

1740
01:54:57.000 --> 01:55:05.000
The first burst took out half a dozen. Some of the wounded and dead Chinese fell into our trenches.

1741
01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:11.000
Others crumbled in a heap near the edge, close enough that we could reach out and touch them.

1742
01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:19.000
I looked down and saw that the gunner was dead. The A gunner was hitting the arms, and I could see blood staining his fatigue jacket,

1743
01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:25.000
but he kept firing his rifle and replacing ammo belts when the machine gun went dry.

1744
01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:29.000
Just as fast as it started, the attack ended.

1745
01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:39.000
There was some sporadic firing from the other side of the perimeter. A couple of guys close to the gun position came over to me and took over.

1746
01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:45.000
As I headed back to my hole, I crawled over several dead American and Chinese.

1747
01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:55.000
Every trench and hole seemed to be filled with wounded men screaming and crying for their mothers.

1748
01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:59.000
Always their mothers.

1749
01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:05.000
We had an added problem now since some of the wounded were Chinese soldiers.

1750
01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:09.000
The dead were not a problem. We just pushed them out in front of the trench,

1751
01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:13.000
but the wounded we had to help if we could.

1752
01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:19.000
The medics did their best, but we barely had enough for our own men.

1753
01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:25.000
The Chinese were all scared to death, crying, and moaning.

1754
01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:31.000
They were the enemy, but they were also soldiers just like us.

1755
01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:37.000
It was difficult to see them that way.

1756
01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:45.000
The next morning, bronzer and grower called me over to them.

1757
01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:49.000
The two artillery lieutenant's male and putters and were also there, grower said,

1758
01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:53.000
what we all knew. We can't stay here any longer.

1759
01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:57.000
There is no doubt my mind that the Chinese will overrun us tonight.

1760
01:56:57.000 --> 01:57:01.000
We need to find a way out. We'll lead a patrol.

1761
01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:07.000
Lieutenant's male and peaters have already volunteered to go.

1762
01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:13.000
I looked at the lieutenant's and nodded my head, yes.

1763
01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:19.000
They're going to find a way out of this perimeter,

1764
01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:23.000
and they're going to do a little reconnaissance tonight,

1765
01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:31.000
or now to try and figure out their route. So that then later they can get out of there and come up with a plan to get out of there.

1766
01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:35.000
Back to the book, because we, and so they're crawling down a trench to try and look for the way out.

1767
01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:39.000
As we crawled down the trench toward the east side,

1768
01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:41.000
word got out that we were going on patrol.

1769
01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:47.000
Peters and crawled by a badly wounded radio operator, lieutenant Petersen, where are you going?

1770
01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:51.000
Looking for a way out, he said.

1771
01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:55.000
Lieutenant Peterson, the radio operator pleaded, please don't leave me here.

1772
01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:59.000
Please don't leave me. You can't leave me here for them to get me.

1773
01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:07.000
Petersen looked shaken, and I urged us forward. I heard him say he was sorry as we crawled off.

1774
01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:15.000
Others reached out to us, patded us on the back, and wished us good luck.

1775
01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:19.000
As we moved down the riverbed, the Chinese soldiers,

1776
01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:25.000
grabbed at us, and held out cops begging for water.

1777
01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:29.000
I took my canteen and turned it upside down to show them that we had no water.

1778
01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:33.000
So there's the enemy. They're also wounded laying in these trenches.

1779
01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:39.000
It's just a total bloodbath, and the Chinese soldiers are asking these Americans.

1780
01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:45.000
And you can even imagine what these guys look like at this point. They've been fighting for weeks on end.

1781
01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:49.000
They have no water. They've had no food. They're out ammunition. They're covered in blood.

1782
01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:53.000
I mean, Richardson's actually wounded.

1783
01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:58.000
And to sorry state therein, you got the Chinese soldiers that are even worse state.

1784
01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:02.000
Begging for water.

1785
01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:10.000
So these guys find a route. I don't want to make it sound like they found some easy escape route that's going to work.

1786
01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:16.000
They found a possible way of getting out of this perimeter. And when they get back,

1787
01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:22.000
they come back and put out the word.

1788
01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:26.000
Like, okay, this is what we're going to try and do.

1789
01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:32.000
And it's a grote talking. He says, we moved it 1700 before the Chinese move in.

1790
01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:37.000
Grote said, word was passed to all able bodied men.

1791
01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:42.000
They were told to make sure that they took what ammunition they had left.

1792
01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:47.000
I got a burp gun and some ammo.

1793
01:59:47.000 --> 01:59:51.000
The wounded men knew what was happening.

1794
01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:56.000
Some broke down, cried, and begged us not to leave.

1795
01:59:56.000 --> 02:00:02.000
Please, dear God, take us. One soldier begged me, grabbing at my shirt.

1796
02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:05.000
Don't leave us to the Chinese.

1797
02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:10.000
Others just watched in silence.

1798
02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:14.000
They knew they'd slow us down.

1799
02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:18.000
They also knew that they'd be dead soon.

1800
02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:23.000
They simply asked that we come back for them.

1801
02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:28.000
But I knew we were leaving them to die or worse, get captured.

1802
02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:33.000
I knew my orders and agreed with them.

1803
02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:38.000
But I couldn't shake the feeling that I was leaving so many good men.

1804
02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:43.000
Men who'd fought well only to be left behind to die.

1805
02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:49.000
I wasn't sure I could ever forget this.

1806
02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:58.000
This was the hardest thing I had done in my short lifetime.

1807
02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:03.000
This is your classic scenario of, hey, what do we do?

1808
02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:06.000
We leave no man behind.

1809
02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:12.000
So then what's going to happen if they do that is everyone is going to die.

1810
02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:14.000
And they make the decision.

1811
02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:18.000
Now we could have a theoretical debate on well,

1812
02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:21.000
maybe if they fought it out, maybe if they stuck together,

1813
02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:26.000
maybe they could defeat the Chinese that are surrounding them.

1814
02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:31.000
In my estimation, this is wrong.

1815
02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:33.000
And you can see these guys already stayed longer.

1816
02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:35.000
They've already done everything that they can.

1817
02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:36.000
They're out of ammunition.

1818
02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:42.000
They're surrounded by Chinese that Chinese have unlimited number of men that are literally in piles around them.

1819
02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:48.000
And they know that if they are going to, if anyone is going to survive,

1820
02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:50.000
then they need to make a break for it.

1821
02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:53.000
And again, it's theoretical for us that it's sitting here.

1822
02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:54.000
It's hypothetical.

1823
02:01:54.000 --> 02:01:57.000
We could say, oh, we'd stay in fight. We could say whatever you want to say right now.

1824
02:01:57.000 --> 02:02:00.000
You're not in that position.

1825
02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:04.000
So now they leave it around five o'clock.

1826
02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:09.000
They start making a move a few hours into the march that rain turned into a downpour in minutes.

1827
02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:13.000
We were soaked to the skin. The temperature was dropping and started to shiver.

1828
02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:15.000
Moving was the only way to stay warm.

1829
02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:23.000
I pushed on trying to get as many miles as possible between us and the old perimeter.

1830
02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:26.000
We were well behind Chinese lines.

1831
02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:29.000
And because of the size of our group, it was likely that we'd be spotted soon.

1832
02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:31.000
Now this is interesting.

1833
02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:35.000
Trying to move with, I think they said they had 80 able bodied men.

1834
02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:38.000
Maybe at 60, that's a massive number of people.

1835
02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:40.000
You can't hide 60 people.

1836
02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:42.000
It doesn't work.

1837
02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:44.000
You can, oh well, I shouldn't say you can't.

1838
02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:47.000
It's very, very difficult to hide 60 people.

1839
02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:49.000
Like a platoon of 40 guys.

1840
02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:54.000
It's hard, you know, in the sealed teams, we have little tiny elements,

1841
02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:56.000
little tiny platoon of 16 guys.

1842
02:02:56.000 --> 02:03:00.000
You can find some terrain that will hide you.

1843
02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:03.000
We've worked in squads with eight guys.

1844
02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:05.000
Like, okay, we can find a place to hide.

1845
02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:10.000
When you have 60 or 80 guys behind enemy lines, that's going to be a challenge.

1846
02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:13.000
I mean, just think about where can you hide that many people.

1847
02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:16.000
Like a perfect terrain feature.

1848
02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:18.000
A ravine, you know, something like that.

1849
02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:22.000
That's a lot of people to put in the ravine and just the noise discipline of people.

1850
02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:23.000
You know, who's going to cough?

1851
02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:25.000
You get 60 people.

1852
02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:26.000
Someone's going to cough.

1853
02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:29.000
I mean, just you and me sitting in this room and we notice one of us

1854
02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:34.000
costs because we're one of us grunts or whatever, because we're recording it.

1855
02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:38.000
But you think about, you know, you nice sitting here for two hours for three hours.

1856
02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:43.000
I would say five times during that one of us will cough.

1857
02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:44.000
Right?

1858
02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:46.000
And you got to go edit it out.

1859
02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:48.000
Sure.

1860
02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:55.000
So if that's happening with two of us, you put 80 people into ravine where they're trying to hide from the enemy.

1861
02:03:55.000 --> 02:03:57.000
And there's how many people are coughing.

1862
02:03:57.000 --> 02:04:01.000
You know, how many people are sneezing?

1863
02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:02.000
Right?

1864
02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:04.000
And it's not, it's not good odds.

1865
02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:06.000
And that's where these guys are saying.

1866
02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:08.000
He is Richardson saying, look, we have a massive group.

1867
02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:12.000
It's not going to be easy to hide.

1868
02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:13.000
Back to the book.

1869
02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:17.000
Get moving to take advantage of the dark.

1870
02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:18.000
I left the house.

1871
02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:20.000
They had been in a little house speaking of hiding.

1872
02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:22.000
I left the house frustrated.

1873
02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:25.000
Sergeant Mayor from the Batyans intelligence section called me over.

1874
02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:26.000
Let's get out of here.

1875
02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:29.000
He said, you and I have a better chance to get back to this group as two large.

1876
02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:33.000
We don't have the fire power to fight and they're slowing us down.

1877
02:04:33.000 --> 02:04:35.000
So here's a guy saying, let Barrow.

1878
02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:36.000
Losers make a run for it.

1879
02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:38.000
He was right.

1880
02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:42.000
I knew that we'd probably make it back to friendly lines together.

1881
02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:46.000
Breaking down in a smaller group would be better.

1882
02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:51.000
But I'd help the Shepherd these men too far to turn my back on them,

1883
02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:53.000
even if it cost me my life.

1884
02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:55.000
Sorry.

1885
02:04:55.000 --> 02:04:56.000
Can't do it.

1886
02:04:56.000 --> 02:05:00.000
Mayor shrugged and disappeared into the darkness.

1887
02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:03.000
So exactly what I just said, this guy made the decision.

1888
02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:04.000
You know what?

1889
02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:06.000
Now, going alone, that's not a good idea either.

1890
02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:09.000
You know, because now you got no one to support you.

1891
02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:10.000
You got no one to watch your sex.

1892
02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:12.000
I mean, that's just a bad idea.

1893
02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:15.000
You can't, you can need to sleep at some point in your by yourself.

1894
02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:17.000
What happens when you start snoring?

1895
02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:18.000
Right?

1896
02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:19.000
Yeah.

1897
02:05:19.000 --> 02:05:21.000
But this guy figured I got a better chance to do it in the spine myself.

1898
02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:22.000
So I'm going to break out.

1899
02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:24.000
Now, you could have given a order like, hey,

1900
02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:27.000
everyone, there's something called a scape and invasion.

1901
02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:30.000
When you're just, everyone's basically every man from self.

1902
02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:32.000
You could do that.

1903
02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:37.000
But at this point, Richardson is like, hey, we made it this far.

1904
02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:39.000
We're going to stick together.

1905
02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:41.000
Back to the book.

1906
02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:43.000
My group climbed to the top of a null.

1907
02:05:43.000 --> 02:05:47.000
I could see the rounds hitting a mountain no more than five miles away.

1908
02:05:47.000 --> 02:05:50.000
We were close for the first time I felt hope.

1909
02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:54.000
Then the hail erupted with machine gun and mortar fire.

1910
02:05:54.000 --> 02:05:56.000
I was knocked flat on my face.

1911
02:05:56.000 --> 02:06:00.000
I quickly got up and just as quickly got back down in the prone position.

1912
02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:02.000
The Chinese were shelling the hail.

1913
02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:04.000
My lower back felt wet.

1914
02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:08.000
And I could feel what I thought was sweat running down the crack of my ass.

1915
02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:09.000
It wasn't sweat.

1916
02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:10.000
It was blood.

1917
02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:13.000
I was hit, but I didn't feel anything.

1918
02:06:13.000 --> 02:06:16.000
There was so much smoke, dirt and dust that I could barely see.

1919
02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:19.000
I stumbled off the hail followed by three others.

1920
02:06:19.000 --> 02:06:22.000
There were about a dozen Chinese soldiers chasing us.

1921
02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:24.000
I prodded myself to think and move.

1922
02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:27.000
We started to head for a village on the other side of the road.

1923
02:06:27.000 --> 02:06:31.000
Behind the village, I could see a massive rice patty that ran up to a hill.

1924
02:06:31.000 --> 02:06:34.000
I figured we could escape it if we got over the hill first.

1925
02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:38.000
The patty had about three or four inches of water in it.

1926
02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:42.000
We stayed on the tops of the dikes and got halfway across the patty before I turned

1927
02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:44.000
to fire back.

1928
02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:49.000
The Chinese soldiers dove for cover when they did we started running again.

1929
02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:53.000
As I was running, I saw rounds hitting the water in front of me.

1930
02:06:53.000 --> 02:06:57.000
It's not good.

1931
02:06:57.000 --> 02:07:03.000
When we got to the other side, we got down.

1932
02:07:03.000 --> 02:07:07.000
We got down behind the dike and started firing at the Chinese again.

1933
02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:09.000
I didn't see anyone behind them.

1934
02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:12.000
If we could take them out, we had a chance.

1935
02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:16.000
But the others didn't have any ammunition left.

1936
02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:19.000
And I was down to a few rounds myself.

1937
02:07:19.000 --> 02:07:22.000
Get going, I said.

1938
02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:24.000
I'll hold them off.

1939
02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:26.000
They looked at me for a second.

1940
02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:32.000
Go, I screamed and turned toward the Chinese soldiers crossing the patty.

1941
02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:35.000
I fired a few shots and then dove behind a dike.

1942
02:07:35.000 --> 02:07:41.000
A few seconds later, I fired two more bursts before I was out of ammunition.

1943
02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:44.000
Between bursts, my mind was searching for an escape route.

1944
02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:48.000
I knew that if I ran straight up the hill, I didn't stand a chance.

1945
02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:51.000
About 30 yards to my right, there was a house.

1946
02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:55.000
A woman in a baby were crying and wailing and a dugout near the hill.

1947
02:07:55.000 --> 02:07:56.000
I went into the house.

1948
02:07:56.000 --> 02:07:59.000
If I went into the house, I was sure the woman would tell them.

1949
02:07:59.000 --> 02:08:02.000
But I couldn't stay behind the dike with no ammunition.

1950
02:08:02.000 --> 02:08:05.000
Jumping up, I ran behind the house and started up the hill.

1951
02:08:05.000 --> 02:08:09.000
I tried to keep the house at my back hoping to mask my movement.

1952
02:08:09.000 --> 02:08:15.000
I went as far as I could go without the Chinese seeing me and then dove into a large bush.

1953
02:08:15.000 --> 02:08:20.000
Rolling onto my stomach with my Chinese burp gun underneath me, I waited.

1954
02:08:20.000 --> 02:08:24.000
I had no ammo, but I had a death grip on the weapon.

1955
02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:27.000
It was like my security blanket.

1956
02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:31.000
I could hear the Chinese soldiers climbing up the hill.

1957
02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:33.000
They were yelling at one another.

1958
02:08:33.000 --> 02:08:37.000
I was trying not to move, not even breathe.

1959
02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:42.000
A fly hovered around my face landing on my nose and mouth.

1960
02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:46.000
I tried to keep my mind closed to everything.

1961
02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:53.000
I closed my eyes as they passed and took my first breath as I heard their yelling behind me.

1962
02:08:53.000 --> 02:08:56.000
In a few minutes, I was sure they were gone.

1963
02:08:56.000 --> 02:08:59.000
But every unit has one.

1964
02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:02.000
A straggler that can't keep up.

1965
02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:09.000
The Chinese straggler was so slow that when he got close to the bush, he saw me.

1966
02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:12.000
I never moved and just shut my eyes.

1967
02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:15.000
He started to holler and drove his bayonet into my butt.

1968
02:09:15.000 --> 02:09:18.000
I felt the tip hit the bone.

1969
02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:21.000
When I opened my eyes, I saw boots all around me.

1970
02:09:21.000 --> 02:09:26.000
My mind went to the burp gun.

1971
02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:31.000
If I rolled over, holding it, they'd shoot me for sure.

1972
02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:38.000
I shot my arms out along the ground and rolled over, leaving the burp gun in the mud.

1973
02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:42.000
They reached down and jerked me up.

1974
02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:45.000
The barrel of the pistol looked like a gun.

1975
02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:53.000
The barrel of the pistol looked like the business end of 105 millimeter hawitzer.

1976
02:09:53.000 --> 02:09:59.000
A Chinese officer with red piping down the side of his pants had the pistol pressed between my eyes.

1977
02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:02.000
He was screaming at me and Chinese, pointing up the hill.

1978
02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:04.000
I was numb and couldn't speak.

1979
02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:06.000
I lifted my shoulders and left them drop.

1980
02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:10.000
I thought of this moment many times.

1981
02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:13.000
And I know that if he pulled the trigger,

1982
02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:16.000
I would never have known it.

1983
02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:19.000
That would have been the end.

1984
02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:21.000
I'd been captured.

1985
02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:24.000
Now when I had no idea what to do, at least when I was on the run,

1986
02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:30.000
I knew where I was going, even fighting for my life was easier than giving up all control.

1987
02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:35.000
I was now at the mercy of the Chinese.

1988
02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:37.000
So there you go.

1989
02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:44.000
Captured.

1990
02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:47.000
There's nothing else you can do.

1991
02:10:47.000 --> 02:10:52.000
Nothing else you can do.

1992
02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:55.000
They muster some other guys that got captured.

1993
02:10:55.000 --> 02:10:57.000
They muster them all together.

1994
02:10:57.000 --> 02:10:58.000
Now we're going back to the book.

1995
02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:00.000
There are about 10 Chinese guards.

1996
02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:02.000
They lined up us.

1997
02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:06.000
They lined up beside us and moved us down the road a couple hundred yards.

1998
02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:11.000
Suddenly the one in the lead started yelling in the whole column stopped.

1999
02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:17.000
The guards grabbed us and made us kneel down in front of a ditch.

2000
02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:22.000
I could hear one of the soldiers barking what sounded like orders in Chinese.

2001
02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:25.000
My mind went on fuller.

2002
02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:29.000
They were going to execute us.

2003
02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:33.000
I felt the guy next to me shaking and another started sobbing.

2004
02:11:33.000 --> 02:11:36.000
My God, this is it.

2005
02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:41.000
This is one of those situations where you expect to see your life flash before your eyes.

2006
02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:45.000
I was ready to really, really have seen from my childhood.

2007
02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:47.000
Good times in Austria.

2008
02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:52.000
Anything to take my mind from Korea and this ditch.

2009
02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:55.000
They didn't happen to me.

2010
02:11:55.000 --> 02:11:59.000
I just closed my eyes.

2011
02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:04.000
Instead of shots, I heard laughing.

2012
02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:06.000
They motioned for us to get up.

2013
02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:10.000
The guy next to me was so emotionally drained that he couldn't get up.

2014
02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:13.000
I tried to help him, but my hands were tied behind my back.

2015
02:12:13.000 --> 02:12:15.000
Get up, I yelled.

2016
02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:18.000
Don't let them laugh at you.

2017
02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:21.000
Get up.

2018
02:12:21.000 --> 02:12:33.000
They get to like a little building and they've been carrying captured rifles this whole time.

2019
02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:36.000
So they get to a little building in back to the book.

2020
02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:40.000
The Chinese dropped the pile of rice on the ground and motioned for us to eat it.

2021
02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:44.000
The prisoners rushed in and started fighting over the grains.

2022
02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:47.000
I staggered back from the melee and angrily watched.

2023
02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:49.000
We've been turned into animals.

2024
02:12:49.000 --> 02:12:56.000
After all we'd been through, why were the others not helping one another?

2025
02:12:56.000 --> 02:12:58.000
Instead, they pushed and fought.

2026
02:12:58.000 --> 02:13:00.000
I refused to join in.

2027
02:13:00.000 --> 02:13:03.000
We needed leadership and control more than ever.

2028
02:13:03.000 --> 02:13:07.000
And I was going to begin leading by example.

2029
02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:14.000
So they get some initial interrogation.

2030
02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:22.000
Of course, that mock execution horrible.

2031
02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:29.000
And then they move into the next chapter, which is called death march.

2032
02:13:29.000 --> 02:13:33.000
We started north up the road at a good clip.

2033
02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:40.000
The guards circled us like sharks, pushing stragglers with their rifles, hitting and kicking anyone who stopped.

2034
02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:42.000
Many in the group were wounded.

2035
02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:45.000
One man had a massive chest wound.

2036
02:13:45.000 --> 02:13:47.000
It was covered by bloodstained bandages.

2037
02:13:47.000 --> 02:13:51.000
He weased as he shuffled down the road.

2038
02:13:51.000 --> 02:13:56.000
My shoulder was a little stiff and the shrapnel in my back was wet and sticky.

2039
02:13:56.000 --> 02:13:57.000
But I felt lucky.

2040
02:13:57.000 --> 02:14:00.000
It was nothing in comparison.

2041
02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:12.000
So, yeah, next time you're thinking you have a rough day, how about your prisoner of war on a death march and you've got a massive chest wound?

2042
02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:16.000
So now one of these, some of the Chinese guards could speak English.

2043
02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:17.000
And here we go.

2044
02:14:17.000 --> 02:14:19.000
Pick up the wounded.

2045
02:14:19.000 --> 02:14:22.000
He kept saying like a broken record.

2046
02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:25.000
Guard started pushing us back toward the back of the formation.

2047
02:14:25.000 --> 02:14:28.000
On the ground, we're about 20 soldiers on Jerry Raked Lidders.

2048
02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:32.000
Made out of burlap bags attached and stretched between poles.

2049
02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:34.000
Ten more soldiers stood around them.

2050
02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:36.000
Pick up the wounded.

2051
02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:38.000
The officer barked again.

2052
02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:40.000
It took four of us to carry one letter.

2053
02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:43.000
I grabbed the closest letter and hoisted it up.

2054
02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:46.000
The soldier in the letter had a horribly mangled leg.

2055
02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:52.000
His calf muscle was long gone and his foot rested on the inner limp.

2056
02:14:52.000 --> 02:14:55.000
On the litter limp and lifeless.

2057
02:14:55.000 --> 02:14:58.000
None of the wounded men had seen a doctor since being captured.

2058
02:14:58.000 --> 02:15:03.000
I heard someone say they'd been in trucks, but were dumped on the road when the trucks were needed elsewhere.

2059
02:15:03.000 --> 02:15:07.000
A whistle sounded and we started to shuffle toward the men.

2060
02:15:07.000 --> 02:15:10.000
None of us were strong enough to carry the stretchers very long.

2061
02:15:10.000 --> 02:15:12.000
My shoulders burned.

2062
02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:14.000
I tried to focus on each step.

2063
02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:16.000
Left, right, left, right.

2064
02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:22.000
Whenever things got tough, my wound mind wandered back to the guy with a sucking chest wound.

2065
02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:25.000
Where I stole a glance at the guy on the litter with a mangled leg.

2066
02:15:25.000 --> 02:15:28.000
I vowed to never quit.

2067
02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:31.000
But soon, my body started to break down.

2068
02:15:31.000 --> 02:15:38.000
I tried to get another prisoner to relieve me, but everyone I asked looked away or moved ahead.

2069
02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:43.000
Most hid in the dark trying to stay as far away from the stretchers as they could.

2070
02:15:43.000 --> 02:15:48.000
You son of a bitch I barked at one soldier who almost jerked away when I asked.

2071
02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:53.000
I was disgusted. It reminded me of the soldiers that first night fighting over the rice.

2072
02:15:53.000 --> 02:15:58.000
We'd forgotten that the backbone of any military was the bond of the soldiers.

2073
02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:01.000
We fought for the guys to our left and right.

2074
02:16:01.000 --> 02:16:05.000
That is why we fought to protect our unit buddies.

2075
02:16:05.000 --> 02:16:08.000
And we expected them to do the same.

2076
02:16:08.000 --> 02:16:13.000
But on a death march, every man was an island.

2077
02:16:13.000 --> 02:16:17.000
There seemed to be no place for anything else.

2078
02:16:17.000 --> 02:16:22.000
I refused to be that way.

2079
02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:28.000
It's heavy burden.

2080
02:16:28.000 --> 02:16:32.000
Each night, the guards were getting tougher.

2081
02:16:32.000 --> 02:16:34.000
They were constantly pushing and hitting men with their rifles.

2082
02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:38.000
If a man fell behind, he was shot and pushed off the mountainside.

2083
02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:40.000
Everyone was rapidly losing weight.

2084
02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:46.000
Lack of food, wounds, and disinterrey were taking their toll.

2085
02:16:46.000 --> 02:16:49.000
Carrying the men on stretchers was becoming even more difficult.

2086
02:16:49.000 --> 02:16:54.000
We looked like skeletons. Our uniform was hung off us like a scarecrow is quote.

2087
02:16:54.000 --> 02:16:59.000
Coach, each time we got topped each time we topped one of the mountains, we faced another one.

2088
02:16:59.000 --> 02:17:04.000
Ears, nose, fingers, and toes were becoming numb.

2089
02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:10.000
At times I felt like I was walking on my ankles.

2090
02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:15.000
I was lucky that my legs had always been the strongest part of my body.

2091
02:17:15.000 --> 02:17:21.000
Many of the wounded men who were strong enough to walk earlier were now in the need of stretchers.

2092
02:17:21.000 --> 02:17:23.000
However, there were none.

2093
02:17:23.000 --> 02:17:26.000
We found ourselves carrying them along between two of us.

2094
02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:30.000
In some cases, we were practically dragging them.

2095
02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:35.000
When I heard a single rifle shot back down the road,

2096
02:17:35.000 --> 02:17:39.000
I knew another man's struggle was over.

2097
02:17:39.000 --> 02:17:44.000
My heart was aching for them, but at the same time my mind kept telling me to move.

2098
02:17:44.000 --> 02:17:47.000
We had two choices.

2099
02:17:47.000 --> 02:17:51.000
March or die.

2100
02:17:55.000 --> 02:18:02.000
My survival mode kicked in, not allowing me to surrender to pain and fatigue.

2101
02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:06.000
The guards shoved us into a cluster of huts.

2102
02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:09.000
So after walking a long time they get to like a little village.

2103
02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:13.000
We were jammed into the room so tightly that my legs rested on another soldier.

2104
02:18:13.000 --> 02:18:17.000
The only thing good about sleeping this way was that we were warmer.

2105
02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:25.000
A cold front from the plains of Manchuria came roaring down and slamming into the very mountains we were struggling through.

2106
02:18:25.000 --> 02:18:30.000
We were facing the coldest winter in 50 years.

2107
02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:37.000
As we got ready to move out the commander of the guards told us to leave the stretchers.

2108
02:18:37.000 --> 02:18:43.000
The wounded were pleading with us to take them.

2109
02:18:43.000 --> 02:18:47.000
I started to move toward one and got a rifle button to gut.

2110
02:18:47.000 --> 02:18:52.000
Others tried to grab the stretchers but the guards pushed them away too.

2111
02:18:52.000 --> 02:18:59.000
I started to move toward the helpless soldiers again but couldn't risk another blow.

2112
02:18:59.000 --> 02:19:06.000
I let my mind drift into a zombie state, hoping to block out the screams of the wounded.

2113
02:19:06.000 --> 02:19:16.000
Left foot, right foot, left foot, right foot, over and over again.

2114
02:19:16.000 --> 02:19:21.000
I repeated it until I couldn't hear their screams.

2115
02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:48.000
Yes, absolutely horrible.

2116
02:19:48.000 --> 02:19:53.64
absolutely horrible.

2117
02:19:53.64 --> 02:20:01.56
After ten nights we marched into a fairly good size town.

2118
02:20:01.56 --> 02:20:08.000
And this is when he decides that he's going to try and escape pretty early on and he's

2119
02:20:08.000 --> 02:20:13.92
got a couple of buddies and there's some confusion and there's some chaos that happens

2120
02:20:13.92 --> 02:20:19.04
as they're trying to round up the prisoners and he kind of jumps over with a couple of the

2121
02:20:19.04 --> 02:20:24.88
guys into a little ditch and they cover up with some branches.

2122
02:20:24.88 --> 02:20:28.44
And they start talking these three guys start saying, look what, you know, can we make

2123
02:20:28.44 --> 02:20:29.44
a move?

2124
02:20:29.44 --> 02:20:35.16
Well, let's, you know, let's head south and then finally one of the guys says that would

2125
02:20:35.16 --> 02:20:37.76
be suicide in our condition.

2126
02:20:37.76 --> 02:20:39.64
We won't make it over those mountains.

2127
02:20:39.64 --> 02:20:43.96
We don't have warm clothes and we will probably die of hypothermia.

2128
02:20:43.96 --> 02:20:47.56
We knew he was right.

2129
02:20:47.56 --> 02:20:50.000
It was smarter to wait until springtime.

2130
02:20:50.000 --> 02:20:58.92
We needed to try and survive and hope our forces liberated us.

2131
02:20:58.92 --> 02:21:01.84
Now they're starting to get into like a little bit of a routine.

2132
02:21:01.84 --> 02:21:05.44
My goal is to bring back discipline and start acting like soldiers again.

2133
02:21:05.44 --> 02:21:09.68
To see the first night with the rice dropped on the ground was burned into my brain, the only

2134
02:21:09.68 --> 02:21:14.76
way we could survive until spring was an impossible escape attempt was to start working

2135
02:21:14.76 --> 02:21:19.48
together.

2136
02:21:19.48 --> 02:21:21.60
The second wounded suffered the most.

2137
02:21:21.60 --> 02:21:26.52
Our frostbitten feet turned to trench foot and open wounds were infected or gangrene

2138
02:21:26.52 --> 02:21:27.52
and set in.

2139
02:21:27.52 --> 02:21:33.36
For those guys, it was only a matter of time before they died since we had no medicine

2140
02:21:33.36 --> 02:21:35.36
to treat them.

2141
02:21:35.36 --> 02:21:41.84
Finally, from his little group, he loses a guy whose last name is Graves.

2142
02:21:41.84 --> 02:21:44.68
Graves was the first to die.

2143
02:21:44.68 --> 02:21:48.76
The valley had turned into one of death and suffering.

2144
02:21:48.76 --> 02:21:54.04
Soon after Graves death, Chaplin Capon came to the house.

2145
02:21:54.04 --> 02:21:55.80
We were all surprised to see him.

2146
02:21:55.80 --> 02:22:00.88
I'd last seen him at Usan, but when he walked in, I barely recognized him.

2147
02:22:00.88 --> 02:22:04.32
The man I'd met on a raging Pusan was gone.

2148
02:22:04.32 --> 02:22:09.20
He lost a lot of weight and his uniform hung on his frame.

2149
02:22:09.20 --> 02:22:14.48
His tired and worn out eyes, but lied his warm smile.

2150
02:22:14.48 --> 02:22:17.88
Capon told us who his dead are wounded before he left.

2151
02:22:17.88 --> 02:22:19.72
He told us to get organized.

2152
02:22:19.72 --> 02:22:21.84
We'll need to take action when the troops show up.

2153
02:22:21.84 --> 02:22:23.56
He said, have a plan.

2154
02:22:23.56 --> 02:22:34.60
When the troops get close, the North Koreans might try to kill us all.

2155
02:22:34.60 --> 02:22:38.76
Capon never came back to my house, but he continued to visit troops in the valley.

2156
02:22:38.76 --> 02:22:43.36
I know he prayed for each one of us when he could, brought food to the starving until he

2157
02:22:43.36 --> 02:22:47.60
became so weak that the guards took him to the hospital.

2158
02:22:47.60 --> 02:22:51.20
We're going to hear about what that hospital consisted of.

2159
02:22:51.20 --> 02:23:01.72
He died of pneumonia in May of 1951, who was buried in a mass grave by the Yalu River.

2160
02:23:01.72 --> 02:23:07.60
If you don't know the story about Chapin Capon, he was awarded the Medal of Honor for his

2161
02:23:07.60 --> 02:23:13.40
actions in the Korean War, and I'm sure we'll cover that more detail at some point on

2162
02:23:13.40 --> 02:23:20.28
this podcast, but at the meantime, you can look it up and read about a hero of war and

2163
02:23:20.28 --> 02:23:23.64
a hero of faith.

2164
02:23:23.64 --> 02:23:28.04
At one point, Richardson tries to steal some kimchi.

2165
02:23:28.04 --> 02:23:37.60
Again, now I'm fast forwarding a bit to where they're a little bit more settled in.

2166
02:23:37.60 --> 02:23:40.92
He steals a bowl of kimchi.

2167
02:23:40.92 --> 02:23:43.04
They start the guards go all nuts.

2168
02:23:43.04 --> 02:23:47.24
They're trying to find out who took the kimchi, who took the kimchi.

2169
02:23:47.24 --> 02:23:50.84
They threaten them with, hey, no one's going to be able to eat until we know who took

2170
02:23:50.84 --> 02:23:56.48
the kimchi and finally he breaks down and says, I did it.

2171
02:23:56.48 --> 02:23:58.68
Only me.

2172
02:23:58.68 --> 02:24:01.48
Now was the officer's turn to shake his head.

2173
02:24:01.48 --> 02:24:02.48
You lie.

2174
02:24:02.48 --> 02:24:03.48
More do it.

2175
02:24:03.48 --> 02:24:05.32
No, only me.

2176
02:24:05.32 --> 02:24:11.48
And the guards, I said, a little son of a bitch looked at me and then nodded to the guards who

2177
02:24:11.48 --> 02:24:17.20
grabbed me and tied my arms behind my back.

2178
02:24:17.20 --> 02:24:18.96
You learned lesson now.

2179
02:24:18.96 --> 02:24:26.08
The officer said, the guards threw a rope over an open truss and pulled me up by my arms

2180
02:24:26.08 --> 02:24:30.56
until my feet barely touched the dirt floor.

2181
02:24:30.56 --> 02:24:32.96
The pain was excruciating.

2182
02:24:32.96 --> 02:24:38.000
I could feel lightning jolt's of pain in my left arm and shoulder where I still had

2183
02:24:38.000 --> 02:24:39.12
sharpened the wounds.

2184
02:24:39.12 --> 02:24:43.12
The pain quickly crept up my arms driving straight to the top of my head.

2185
02:24:43.12 --> 02:24:51.44
I gasped for air. the pressure on my chest allowed me to take only sharp, short breaths.

2186
02:24:51.44 --> 02:25:00.76
I could hear myself moaning and once I cried out and pain before I passed out.

2187
02:25:00.76 --> 02:25:02.04
I woke up on the dirt floor.

2188
02:25:02.04 --> 02:25:06.08
I could barely feel the guards pulling the ropes off my arms.

2189
02:25:06.08 --> 02:25:09.60
I could hear the son of a bitch rattle off a few orders.

2190
02:25:09.60 --> 02:25:14.16
He sounded far away but I could see his boots and knew he was standing over me.

2191
02:25:14.16 --> 02:25:18.88
The guards dragged me to my feet throwing open the door that tossed me on the floor of my

2192
02:25:18.88 --> 02:25:19.88
room.

2193
02:25:19.88 --> 02:25:25.28
I could barely move my legs and arms and stayed where I landed the rest of the night.

2194
02:25:25.28 --> 02:25:29.76
Martin helped me get comfortable and told me that the house had been fed earlier that

2195
02:25:29.76 --> 02:25:31.56
night.

2196
02:25:31.56 --> 02:25:35.84
He had no idea how long I'd been strong up.

2197
02:25:35.84 --> 02:25:40.000
In the next morning, I sat up and started making jokes.

2198
02:25:40.000 --> 02:25:42.000
Some of them laughed with me.

2199
02:25:42.000 --> 02:25:43.76
Others were just scared.

2200
02:25:43.76 --> 02:25:48.64
Laughing hurt my ribs but it was the first time I've done it since you saw.

2201
02:25:48.64 --> 02:25:51.24
I was determined to keep my sense of humor.

2202
02:25:51.24 --> 02:25:57.36
I was tied to my will to live.

2203
02:25:57.36 --> 02:26:02.20
From that point on, I remember to laugh whenever I could.

2204
02:26:02.20 --> 02:26:10.48
Well, I guess we won't be having kimchi anymore.

2205
02:26:10.48 --> 02:26:13.72
After two months in the valley, the guards marches out of the valley and back up to the

2206
02:26:13.72 --> 02:26:19.56
road in Pew Tongue.

2207
02:26:19.56 --> 02:26:24.44
So they're in a different location now.

2208
02:26:24.44 --> 02:26:30.92
In this location, the Chinese finally fully take over the operation of the camp as opposed

2209
02:26:30.92 --> 02:26:33.96
to the Koreans, the North Koreans.

2210
02:26:33.96 --> 02:26:39.24
So now it seems like the Chinese were a little bit nicer to the prisoners.

2211
02:26:39.24 --> 02:26:43.80
The Chinese issued each of us a small drinking cup along with a bowl for a millet or

2212
02:26:43.80 --> 02:26:45.20
our maize.

2213
02:26:45.20 --> 02:26:47.72
No more eating out of a helmet liner.

2214
02:26:47.72 --> 02:26:51.24
We were also allowed to start a cookhouse for each company and we were occasionally given

2215
02:26:51.24 --> 02:26:54.76
soybeans.

2216
02:26:54.76 --> 02:27:00.60
The wells were contaminated from animal and human feces, seeping through the ground and into

2217
02:27:00.60 --> 02:27:05.44
the water well so we didn't have fresh water.

2218
02:27:05.44 --> 02:27:08.000
There were about 3,000 men in the camp.

2219
02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:11.76
Conditions were about as bad as a human being could possibly live with.

2220
02:27:11.76 --> 02:27:15.000
So again, I pointed out that the Chinese were a little bit nicer because they gave them

2221
02:27:15.000 --> 02:27:19.32
like a bowl but it's don't get me wrong.

2222
02:27:19.32 --> 02:27:24.000
This was about as close as you could get to Andersonville in the Civil War, which that

2223
02:27:24.000 --> 02:27:31.56
was a Confederate prisoner of war camp for Union soldiers.

2224
02:27:31.56 --> 02:27:36.56
There was about 45,000 soldiers that were captured in that.

2225
02:27:36.56 --> 02:27:46.88
In that prison camp, about 13,000 of them died from scurvy and from diarrhea and dysentery.

2226
02:27:46.88 --> 02:27:50.20
It's funny we think of diarrhea.

2227
02:27:50.20 --> 02:27:53.92
First of all we think of as a joke and then we think of as an inconvenience.

2228
02:27:53.92 --> 02:27:58.72
And when you're in these situations it kills you.

2229
02:27:58.72 --> 02:28:00.68
Back to the book we were full of lice.

2230
02:28:00.68 --> 02:28:06.64
The farm boys told us they were hoglice growing larger every day on our blood while

2231
02:28:06.64 --> 02:28:10.08
the lice got fat we starved.

2232
02:28:10.08 --> 02:28:16.28
The guards brought us two bowls of millet a day and one bowl of boiled water which

2233
02:28:16.28 --> 02:28:19.12
barely kept us alive.

2234
02:28:19.12 --> 02:28:23.84
And even when we ate dysentery kept us weak and dehydrated.

2235
02:28:23.84 --> 02:28:28.60
Longer can do some strange things to your mind.

2236
02:28:28.60 --> 02:28:34.68
I was at the latrine a slit trench and I noticed that many of the soy beans were passed

2237
02:28:34.68 --> 02:28:36.56
whole.

2238
02:28:36.56 --> 02:28:44.52
I thought if I picked them out of the feces and washed them off I could eat them.

2239
02:28:44.52 --> 02:28:48.12
Then it dawned on me that I must be going crazy or turning into an animal.

2240
02:28:48.12 --> 02:28:52.88
It would be a few days before I was able to get over the fact that I'd let myself sink to

2241
02:28:52.88 --> 02:29:02.88
a disgusting thought like that.

2242
02:29:02.88 --> 02:29:07.96
So next time you're feeling hungry you're not feeling hungry.

2243
02:29:07.96 --> 02:29:14.60
You even know what that feels like.

2244
02:29:14.60 --> 02:29:19.32
They ended up like a former little group.

2245
02:29:19.32 --> 02:29:23.88
He just mentions this one guy in this group named Vincent Doyle.

2246
02:29:23.88 --> 02:29:26.12
Doyle became the leader of this little group.

2247
02:29:26.12 --> 02:29:30.04
An infantryman during World War II.

2248
02:29:30.04 --> 02:29:32.80
He had a wife and a son in fall with River Massachusetts.

2249
02:29:32.80 --> 02:29:36.60
He received a battlefield commission in France and left the army as the lieutenant.

2250
02:29:36.60 --> 02:29:40.000
He opened up a frozen food store in fall river.

2251
02:29:40.000 --> 02:29:42.68
A little ahead of its time not many families had freezers.

2252
02:29:42.68 --> 02:29:47.48
He went out of business and re-enlisted as a master sergeant, not an officer.

2253
02:29:47.48 --> 02:29:51.16
He was an inch too short to be an officer of the army told him.

2254
02:29:51.16 --> 02:29:55.16
Yeah, that's one of the reasons why I left that in there is like the guy's just humble.

2255
02:29:55.16 --> 02:29:56.76
Like, oh, I can't cut his an officer anymore.

2256
02:29:56.76 --> 02:29:59.96
Even though I got a battlefield commission in World War II.

2257
02:29:59.96 --> 02:30:00.96
Oh, that's okay.

2258
02:30:00.96 --> 02:30:01.96
I'll just be honest.

2259
02:30:01.96 --> 02:30:04.04
Let's know for no factor.

2260
02:30:04.04 --> 02:30:06.40
That's like the humility.

2261
02:30:06.40 --> 02:30:09.80
I don't know if you see that kind of humility anymore.

2262
02:30:09.80 --> 02:30:14.92
No man, don't make a big deal out of the generational differences, but that's a pretty humble

2263
02:30:14.92 --> 02:30:15.92
guy right there.

2264
02:30:15.92 --> 02:30:23.40
Back to the book, our biggest problem was our physical condition brought on by the march.

2265
02:30:23.40 --> 02:30:28.16
Men with open wounds, many with gangrene didn't survive long.

2266
02:30:28.16 --> 02:30:33.88
Some were saved from gangrene by maggots eating their dead flesh, which only meant they

2267
02:30:33.88 --> 02:30:34.88
suffered longer.

2268
02:30:34.88 --> 02:30:39.32
I mean, we've been through that before with a forgotten islander who they would actually

2269
02:30:39.32 --> 02:30:45.44
put maggots to get rid of dead flesh to try and save themselves.

2270
02:30:45.44 --> 02:30:48.20
The soldiers had black feet from frostbite and trench foot.

2271
02:30:48.20 --> 02:30:53.84
I watched while one man pulled rod and flesh off his toe bones.

2272
02:30:53.84 --> 02:30:56.84
The soldiers from the second infantry division had it worst.

2273
02:30:56.84 --> 02:31:02.40
They'd been issued shoe packs, rubber boots with felt liners and insoles.

2274
02:31:02.40 --> 02:31:07.08
Their feet would sweat and they were continuously wet while marching and they would freeze

2275
02:31:07.08 --> 02:31:08.36
when they stopped marching.

2276
02:31:08.36 --> 02:31:13.88
Since they never took off the shoe packs, the soldiers got trench foot.

2277
02:31:13.88 --> 02:31:17.44
It's easily understood when men die of wounds or pneumonia.

2278
02:31:17.44 --> 02:31:22.88
It is more difficult to understand when men just lie down and quit.

2279
02:31:22.88 --> 02:31:25.92
I've seen strong men seemingly just give up and die.

2280
02:31:25.92 --> 02:31:31.64
First they would stop eating and stare with blank eyes at the mud walls of the hut.

2281
02:31:31.64 --> 02:31:37.16
Their minds were gone and life just slipped away.

2282
02:31:37.16 --> 02:31:44.60
And after a few days, you heard an all-too familiar death rattle.

2283
02:31:44.60 --> 02:31:47.96
We were dying at a rate of about 30 a day.

2284
02:31:47.96 --> 02:31:51.92
Each morning we took out the dead, stripped them of their clothes and stacked them like

2285
02:31:51.92 --> 02:31:53.32
cordwood and a pile.

2286
02:31:53.32 --> 02:31:56.84
At first we tried to take the uniforms and coats and give them to other prisoners but the

2287
02:31:56.84 --> 02:32:00.44
Chinese guards wouldn't allow it.

2288
02:32:00.44 --> 02:32:04.84
What they did with the uniforms is still a mystery.

2289
02:32:04.84 --> 02:32:08.16
I hated being part of the burial detail.

2290
02:32:08.16 --> 02:32:11.80
The physical part was bad enough but the mental part was much worse.

2291
02:32:11.80 --> 02:32:15.40
Thoughts about the families of the dead men and if they left children behind who might

2292
02:32:15.40 --> 02:32:19.08
never know what happened to them.

2293
02:32:19.08 --> 02:32:22.88
I knew from listening to men talk that what bothered most of them was the thought that

2294
02:32:22.88 --> 02:32:24.60
they might be next.

2295
02:32:24.60 --> 02:32:31.60
That's one thing I never let my mind think about.

2296
02:32:31.60 --> 02:32:43.84
And again he moves around a bit to various places and various camps and gets various jobs.

2297
02:32:43.84 --> 02:32:50.36
And again you have to read this book to really comprehend this level of suffering that

2298
02:32:50.36 --> 02:32:52.60
was endured by these prisoners.

2299
02:32:52.60 --> 02:32:56.96
Back to the book in early spring 1951 the Chinese were building small docs on the river

2300
02:32:56.96 --> 02:33:01.04
and I was unlucky enough to be put to work on the crew.

2301
02:33:01.04 --> 02:33:04.68
The group of us were carrying one of these timbers up a hill when someone in the center

2302
02:33:04.68 --> 02:33:10.80
stumble and the timber fell, pinning me to the ground.

2303
02:33:10.80 --> 02:33:18.96
And when that happens his back gets jammed up and even he makes it through that day.

2304
02:33:18.96 --> 02:33:21.56
It starts getting worse and worse throughout the day.

2305
02:33:21.56 --> 02:33:26.76
Now there's a hospital, right?

2306
02:33:26.76 --> 02:33:29.12
It's a hospital but they actually called this hospital.

2307
02:33:29.12 --> 02:33:32.08
It's just like every other prisoner camp that we've heard about when you go to the hospital

2308
02:33:32.08 --> 02:33:33.08
your dead.

2309
02:33:33.08 --> 02:33:34.76
That's just the place they put you to die.

2310
02:33:34.76 --> 02:33:36.16
And it's the same thing here.

2311
02:33:36.16 --> 02:33:41.44
So his guys are trying to prevent him from being taken to the hospital.

2312
02:33:41.44 --> 02:33:46.16
So they're carrying him back and forth to their formations and finally the Chinese realized

2313
02:33:46.16 --> 02:33:48.56
that he can't walk.

2314
02:33:48.56 --> 02:33:54.20
So the Chinese come to the door and back to the book they were taking me to the hospital.

2315
02:33:54.20 --> 02:33:55.48
We called it the morgue.

2316
02:33:55.48 --> 02:33:57.88
We had never seen anyone return from there.

2317
02:33:57.88 --> 02:34:00.20
I wanted to fight back but I couldn't.

2318
02:34:00.20 --> 02:34:04.92
The guards closed the door to one of the rooms in the cluster of houses that served as

2319
02:34:04.92 --> 02:34:06.68
the hospital and threw me in.

2320
02:34:06.68 --> 02:34:08.60
It was dark and I could not see anyone.

2321
02:34:08.60 --> 02:34:12.32
I landed on top of the wounded and sick lying on the dirt floor.

2322
02:34:12.32 --> 02:34:15.04
They immediately started kicking and cursing me.

2323
02:34:15.04 --> 02:34:18.76
The stench from the wounds and the human feces was unimaginable.

2324
02:34:18.76 --> 02:34:21.64
I started to gag.

2325
02:34:21.64 --> 02:34:25.44
So this is, I mean this is just the, I don't even imagine anything.

2326
02:34:25.44 --> 02:34:30.72
This is going to be worse than the situation is and now this put in this giant room filled

2327
02:34:30.72 --> 02:34:34.32
with shit and wounded people that are going to die.

2328
02:34:34.32 --> 02:34:37.32
And by the way, it's like they've got dysentery and they've got diarrhea.

2329
02:34:37.32 --> 02:34:40.56
So it's just a total nightmare.

2330
02:34:40.56 --> 02:34:45.28
And he's trying to maintain a little bit of dignity and he asks one of the guys in

2331
02:34:45.28 --> 02:34:49.12
room, where's the, where's the latrine?

2332
02:34:49.12 --> 02:34:51.68
He had to use the restroom.

2333
02:34:51.68 --> 02:34:56.20
And the guy tells him, out the door go left to the end of the building left again in

2334
02:34:56.20 --> 02:35:00.60
25 yards on a no you'll find the latrine.

2335
02:35:00.60 --> 02:35:02.64
The temperature was freezing but I welcome the fresh air.

2336
02:35:02.64 --> 02:35:06.68
I dragged myself out on my buttocks, pushing myself along with my hands.

2337
02:35:06.68 --> 02:35:08.84
I reach the latrine.

2338
02:35:08.84 --> 02:35:12.44
A trench of foot and a half wide and ten feet long.

2339
02:35:12.44 --> 02:35:19.48
The trench sat just outside a strand of wire that separated our camp from the black prisoners.

2340
02:35:19.48 --> 02:35:24.12
The human waste was like putting an almost reach to the top of the trench.

2341
02:35:24.12 --> 02:35:29.92
I managed to get my pants down and had worked my way to the edge when the side cave

2342
02:35:29.92 --> 02:35:31.80
didn't.

2343
02:35:31.80 --> 02:35:35.36
I fell into the trench, finally catching my shoulders on the edge.

2344
02:35:35.36 --> 02:35:39.80
The waste was at my chin as I clawed at the dirt trying to pull myself free.

2345
02:35:39.80 --> 02:35:45.88
My legs paralyzed like an anchor pulled me toward the bottom.

2346
02:35:45.88 --> 02:35:53.24
I yelled out and kept crawling but every second I slipped deeper and deeper into the trench.

2347
02:35:53.24 --> 02:35:56.000
Two black prisoners on the other side heard me.

2348
02:35:56.000 --> 02:36:00.56
They crawled through the barbed wire, grabbed me by my arms and pulled me out a second

2349
02:36:00.56 --> 02:36:05.12
later and I would have slipped under the surface.

2350
02:36:05.12 --> 02:36:07.76
The guards heard all the commotion that were closing in.

2351
02:36:07.76 --> 02:36:13.000
My savior scrambled back through the fence just as the guards arrived to this day I have

2352
02:36:13.000 --> 02:36:15.84
no idea who saved me.

2353
02:36:15.84 --> 02:36:19.92
Fearing I was trying to escape, they started to beat me with the rifle butts.

2354
02:36:19.92 --> 02:36:25.28
I covered my head to try and protect myself as I lay there, covered in shit.

2355
02:36:25.28 --> 02:36:31.44
I lost control of my bowels.

2356
02:36:31.44 --> 02:36:34.04
That was it.

2357
02:36:34.04 --> 02:36:38.88
I was done.

2358
02:36:38.88 --> 02:36:42.08
But giving up meant death.

2359
02:36:42.08 --> 02:36:45.04
I had lived with death every day since coming to Korea.

2360
02:36:45.04 --> 02:36:47.88
The battlefield was like a movie and fast forward.

2361
02:36:47.88 --> 02:36:52.12
There was so much going on and I couldn't dwell on death very long.

2362
02:36:52.12 --> 02:36:53.12
Call for the medic.

2363
02:36:53.12 --> 02:36:57.60
Possibly hold the wounded man in my arms or say a word or two as he passed from life

2364
02:36:57.60 --> 02:37:00.72
to death.

2365
02:37:00.72 --> 02:37:03.48
It was different as a prisoner.

2366
02:37:03.48 --> 02:37:09.000
I had no way of defending myself other than using my mind and what physical capabilities

2367
02:37:09.000 --> 02:37:13.32
I could muster.

2368
02:37:13.32 --> 02:37:23.88
I realized my mind had to be my strength for a split second.

2369
02:37:23.88 --> 02:37:29.92
All of the pain and suffering could have ended.

2370
02:37:29.92 --> 02:37:33.64
No, my mind screamed.

2371
02:37:33.64 --> 02:37:35.56
I could not give up.

2372
02:37:35.56 --> 02:37:42.64
I'd come this far and in that second I set my mind to doing something no one had done.

2373
02:37:42.64 --> 02:37:46.60
I was going to come back from the morgue.

2374
02:37:46.60 --> 02:37:52.72
As the Chinese soldiers landed blow after blow on my back and legs, I banished death

2375
02:37:52.72 --> 02:37:55.20
from my mind.

2376
02:37:55.20 --> 02:37:57.56
Never again.

2377
02:37:57.56 --> 02:38:07.44
I did it enter into it.

2378
02:38:07.44 --> 02:38:12.28
Many lost control of their minds and did things they would never have done under normal

2379
02:38:12.28 --> 02:38:13.64
circumstances.

2380
02:38:13.64 --> 02:38:16.40
I didn't know what to say.

2381
02:38:16.40 --> 02:38:21.16
When I heard stories or saw things where men were mistreating one another, I thought

2382
02:38:21.16 --> 02:38:24.96
of the first night of captivity when the Chinese dumped the rice on the ground.

2383
02:38:24.96 --> 02:38:27.56
What happens to men when they become prisoners?

2384
02:38:27.56 --> 02:38:34.68
Why do they change from helping one another and becoming totally engrossed in themselves

2385
02:38:34.68 --> 02:38:38.48
with totally selfish outlook on life?

2386
02:38:38.48 --> 02:38:43.60
Understand, I'm not talking about all men, but many never come to grips with losing their

2387
02:38:43.60 --> 02:38:45.32
freedom.

2388
02:38:45.32 --> 02:38:50.48
They feel abandoned by their country and are no longer with men they trust and their minds,

2389
02:38:50.48 --> 02:38:57.12
their personal survival becomes paramount and group survival no longer matters.

2390
02:38:57.12 --> 02:39:03.96
So again, I mean going back to that part of the latrine, that's a little, that's a little

2391
02:39:03.96 --> 02:39:08.000
footnote you can put in your brain for the rest of your life because we're all going to

2392
02:39:08.000 --> 02:39:09.48
have bad situations.

2393
02:39:09.48 --> 02:39:10.48
I get it.

2394
02:39:10.48 --> 02:39:13.32
I mean there's going to be horrible things that are going to happen.

2395
02:39:13.32 --> 02:39:18.72
I don't know if there's much, I don't know if it can get much worse than the situation

2396
02:39:18.72 --> 02:39:30.96
that he was in right there and realizing that his mind was a strength realizing that

2397
02:39:30.96 --> 02:39:39.28
he had no other way to defend, but his mind had to be strong and he had that little split

2398
02:39:39.28 --> 02:39:44.28
second thought that he could give up and just let it all go.

2399
02:39:44.28 --> 02:39:58.40
Let that pain and suffering stop, but then he realized no, not going to do that, not going

2400
02:39:58.40 --> 02:40:13.48
to surrender, not happening.

2401
02:40:13.48 --> 02:40:20.68
So eventually, I mean he goes through more hell and eventually gets on a two crutches

2402
02:40:20.68 --> 02:40:25.04
and then one crutch and eventually he makes it, he makes it out of the morgue and he gets

2403
02:40:25.04 --> 02:40:30.28
sent back with the rest of the rest of the team and when he gets bent there, like completely

2404
02:40:30.28 --> 02:40:33.80
missed it, this is a guy that they probably mourned his death because they thought when

2405
02:40:33.80 --> 02:40:38.32
you go to the morgue you're dead and when he gets back, he's with Doyle and smoke.

2406
02:40:38.32 --> 02:40:42.92
These are his boys, Doyle and smoke, SMOAK.

2407
02:40:42.92 --> 02:40:48.04
Welcome back Doyle said, says, no one had ever come back from the morgue the guy's

2408
02:40:48.04 --> 02:40:54.80
peppered me with questions about his treatment, what treatment I said and they all laughed.

2409
02:40:54.80 --> 02:41:00.60
I told them we never received any medicine, got less food in the room smelled like a cesspool.

2410
02:41:00.60 --> 02:41:06.52
I told them how I'd almost drown in the trench and that two guys from the black compound

2411
02:41:06.52 --> 02:41:09.96
save my life.

2412
02:41:09.96 --> 02:41:15.24
It was a shitty situation I said and again they all laughed.

2413
02:41:15.24 --> 02:41:22.68
So this guy does a great job of trying to keep track of that humor.

2414
02:41:22.68 --> 02:41:26.32
Since I'd been in the morgue the Chinese had started putting a lot of pressure on us.

2415
02:41:26.32 --> 02:41:30.48
We were required to spend hours and lectures and discussion groups supervised by Chinese

2416
02:41:30.48 --> 02:41:31.48
political officers.

2417
02:41:31.48 --> 02:41:34.24
This is when their indoctrination is taking place.

2418
02:41:34.24 --> 02:41:37.48
Doyle explained that the political officers began by breaking you down physically so you

2419
02:41:37.48 --> 02:41:40.84
started to agree with them and then just to get them off your back.

2420
02:41:40.84 --> 02:41:45.20
When this happened they would be on you full force pushing you to make a statement against

2421
02:41:45.20 --> 02:41:49.12
the United States government or to make a statement as the next wonderful treatment that

2422
02:41:49.12 --> 02:41:50.68
you're receiving.

2423
02:41:50.68 --> 02:41:56.80
Next you'd be one of the turncotes standing up on stage giving a lecture.

2424
02:41:56.80 --> 02:42:00.48
So they're going through this even though they're getting trying to get propaganda statements

2425
02:42:00.48 --> 02:42:01.48
out of them.

2426
02:42:01.48 --> 02:42:02.84
They're still getting treated horribly.

2427
02:42:02.84 --> 02:42:04.60
We were still dying in great numbers.

2428
02:42:04.60 --> 02:42:06.88
It had just been removed from our site.

2429
02:42:06.88 --> 02:42:08.84
They also tried to improve our diet.

2430
02:42:08.84 --> 02:42:13.36
Prisoners even started to make steam bread by taking balls of dough and placing them on a bamboo

2431
02:42:13.36 --> 02:42:17.80
rack over a pot of steaming water.

2432
02:42:17.80 --> 02:42:21.88
And one of the leaders I just had to note this one.

2433
02:42:21.88 --> 02:42:28.60
One of the interrogation propaganda communist leader said, I will leave 100 men to die to

2434
02:42:28.60 --> 02:42:33.40
save one progressive.

2435
02:42:33.40 --> 02:42:34.40
The main communist.

2436
02:42:34.40 --> 02:42:40.54
The main spoken list, those are the words that they used the Chinese interrogators,

2437
02:42:40.54 --> 02:42:44.64
propaganda people, spoken English.

2438
02:42:44.64 --> 02:42:49.28
And he says, we, I would be challenged the loss of individual freedom under their system.

2439
02:42:49.28 --> 02:42:51.72
The Chinese became quite agitated.

2440
02:42:51.72 --> 02:42:55.000
And I like this part.

2441
02:42:55.000 --> 02:42:59.32
So they're again, I mean, I don't want to say that they're getting the treatments good

2442
02:42:59.32 --> 02:43:02.40
by any stretch, but it's at least a little bit better.

2443
02:43:02.40 --> 02:43:05.44
And it's part of it is them trying to convince them to, you know, be communist.

2444
02:43:05.44 --> 02:43:09.52
They can make statements against American do that or a thing.

2445
02:43:09.52 --> 02:43:11.96
So here's this one part.

2446
02:43:11.96 --> 02:43:16.96
Despite working many hours building the long houses, we were still required to attend

2447
02:43:16.96 --> 02:43:18.36
lectures.

2448
02:43:18.36 --> 02:43:22.12
And one Chinese acting troupe came to town.

2449
02:43:22.12 --> 02:43:25.84
It was their version of a USO show called the White Hair to Girl.

2450
02:43:25.84 --> 02:43:28.24
The storyline was simple.

2451
02:43:28.24 --> 02:43:33.32
A peasant family could not pay the taxes demanded by the dastardly landowner so he takes

2452
02:43:33.32 --> 02:43:38.32
the peasant's beautiful young black hair daughter as his concubine.

2453
02:43:38.32 --> 02:43:45.000
She suffers terribly under his demented date demands, but eventually escapes to the mountains.

2454
02:43:45.000 --> 02:43:49.36
Years later as the people's liberation army frees the people.

2455
02:43:49.36 --> 02:43:55.08
The girl returns to the village, but now her hair has turned completely white.

2456
02:43:55.08 --> 02:43:59.68
The play was well done and the Chinese officers and soldiers hung on every word.

2457
02:43:59.68 --> 02:44:02.92
They saw the girl's story as their own.

2458
02:44:02.92 --> 02:44:05.84
They clapped when the people's liberation army arrived.

2459
02:44:05.84 --> 02:44:10.20
The play of course omitted the fact that Mao would killed thousands and I'll correct him

2460
02:44:10.20 --> 02:44:16.28
there millions of people and his drive to take control of China.

2461
02:44:16.28 --> 02:44:20.24
And this is why I read this part because he says, we laughed and cheered when the land

2462
02:44:20.24 --> 02:44:25.48
lowered drag the young girl away. The Chinese guards were not amused and for days there

2463
02:44:25.48 --> 02:44:30.08
were an awkward silence.

2464
02:44:30.08 --> 02:44:36.32
I kind of got to kick out of that bunch of ram bunkers prisoners of war ruining your

2465
02:44:36.32 --> 02:44:40.000
little play.

2466
02:44:40.000 --> 02:44:44.08
When I got warm enough the Chinese let us stake out a baseball field near the river.

2467
02:44:44.08 --> 02:44:46.92
We didn't have any balls or bats but we went through the motions.

2468
02:44:46.92 --> 02:44:52.16
We made teams and selected umpires. We called balls and strikes. It sounded weird but we

2469
02:44:52.16 --> 02:44:55.48
had a lot of fun. We spent hours out there.

2470
02:44:55.48 --> 02:44:59.40
And then he goes on to tell this story late one afternoon. I got what I read that I was like

2471
02:44:59.40 --> 02:45:02.44
that's kind of interesting. I mean I could see we do something to entertain yourself

2472
02:45:02.44 --> 02:45:06.56
but they had a little bit of a bigger plan. Late one afternoon alone American fighter jet

2473
02:45:06.56 --> 02:45:11.80
came screaming down the river. We were out on the ball field. At first it scared the

2474
02:45:11.80 --> 02:45:16.44
hell out of us and went by us in a flash but doubled back and flew straight down the river.

2475
02:45:16.44 --> 02:45:20.60
We could see the pilot looking down and as he passed the pilot waved and wiggled his wings

2476
02:45:20.60 --> 02:45:25.88
at us. There will no words describe how that incident made us feel. God bless him. He

2477
02:45:25.88 --> 02:45:31.32
probably never knew that's what that simple acted for us. It was very long time before we

2478
02:45:31.32 --> 02:45:36.28
stopped talking about it and we had achieved our goal with the ball field. The Chinese

2479
02:45:36.28 --> 02:45:41.24
refused to identify POW camps but the ball field did the trick.

2480
02:45:41.24 --> 02:45:50.36
Soon after winter set in another going another winter I got sick.

2481
02:45:50.36 --> 02:45:54.60
Started running a high fever and was coughing up green and yellow mucus. Doyle and smoke

2482
02:45:54.60 --> 02:45:59.000
moved me near the stove and kept me hydrated with hot water. A medic told me I had new

2483
02:45:59.000 --> 02:46:04.60
ammonia. I thought of graves and was grateful that I wasn't still in the morgue.

2484
02:46:04.60 --> 02:46:09.48
After a couple days the fever broke and I got better. Doyle and smoke both said they were

2485
02:46:09.48 --> 02:46:14.60
sure I'd make it. Yeah. Yeah Rich some of us thought we might need to dip you in the

2486
02:46:14.60 --> 02:46:24.44
shit house again to make you better as what smoked all of them. In early spring my legs were

2487
02:46:24.44 --> 02:46:31.72
finally in shape to begin thinking about escape again. When I read that I just wrote the words

2488
02:46:31.72 --> 02:46:38.28
long game next to it. I mean bro can you imagine your three years deep in prison camp and the

2489
02:46:38.28 --> 02:46:43.000
whole time you're thinking well if I can take the next year to get my legs healed up enough where

2490
02:46:43.000 --> 02:46:47.000
I can walk then I can try and escape again. Even if first guy captures like okay if I can just

2491
02:46:47.000 --> 02:46:51.24
make the spring time will be a little bit stronger let the weather just talk about playing the

2492
02:46:51.24 --> 02:47:06.20
long game. As they were playing in this escape they were going to take Doyle and smoke and they were

2493
02:47:06.20 --> 02:47:10.92
talking about it and soon smoke was doubled over. Doyle tried to get the Chinese to do something

2494
02:47:10.92 --> 02:47:17.32
but they ignored his please. Soon smoke couldn't talk. He just lay in bed and moan. When it got

2495
02:47:17.32 --> 02:47:22.92
really bad he screamed finally he passed out. His face was locked into torn tortured grimace

2496
02:47:22.92 --> 02:47:28.76
and his skin turned ash and at noon the medic that was helping him turn to us and shook his head.

2497
02:47:28.76 --> 02:47:37.80
He's dead. The words landed on us like mortar rounds. I just stood there staring at his face and

2498
02:47:37.80 --> 02:47:42.92
shock dead. How could this have happened in such a short time only seven months ago man. We're

2499
02:47:42.92 --> 02:47:47.80
dying all around us. It was normal since we'd moved prisoners didn't die anymore. We were the

2500
02:47:47.80 --> 02:47:59.80
survivors. This wasn't supposed to happen to anyone anymore. The shock quickly boiled up into a rage.

2501
02:47:59.80 --> 02:48:07.16
These guys kind of yell at the Chinese and make a little. They kind of call some problems.

2502
02:48:08.28 --> 02:48:16.44
Nothing too drastic but they weren't just cowering anymore. Back to the book the winter of

2503
02:48:16.44 --> 02:48:21.88
1952 to 53 was livable compared to the past two winters. We were allowed to select our own leaders

2504
02:48:21.88 --> 02:48:26.76
in organized committees to work on different facets of our daily life. A sanitation committee,

2505
02:48:26.76 --> 02:48:31.64
athletic committee, a daily action committee all brought some semblance of order to our lives.

2506
02:48:32.52 --> 02:48:38.60
Food had improved too. We got steamed bread vegetables and rice. Once in a while some fish and meat.

2507
02:48:38.60 --> 02:48:45.40
But it was usually just a scrap. The change in diet was enough to let us gain some weight.

2508
02:48:52.60 --> 02:48:59.64
July 27th 1953 the Chinese had us all in a formation when they announced that a piece of

2509
02:48:59.64 --> 02:49:06.84
agreement had been reached. We stood silently looking at one another. No one said anything.

2510
02:49:06.84 --> 02:49:13.88
This news had been a long time coming. I just stood there a smile plastered across my face.

2511
02:49:13.88 --> 02:49:20.52
I looked down at my rail thin frame like a map it showed my journey. Scars on my back from

2512
02:49:20.52 --> 02:49:27.56
shrapnel, a missing tooth, night blindness from lack of vitamins which luckily only lasted

2513
02:49:27.56 --> 02:49:37.88
for a couple of weeks. I was one of the fortunate ones. I'd survived. That's it. I mean that's

2514
02:49:39.08 --> 02:49:42.52
the just changes immediately. Now they still have to get out of there. To this day,

2515
02:49:43.56 --> 02:49:47.08
when I think of our movement south, I still get butterflies in my stomach.

2516
02:49:50.36 --> 02:49:56.36
They were moving us to the railhead at Mampo. The Chinese gave one of the prisoners a lock and told

2517
02:49:56.36 --> 02:50:02.36
him to close the gates after the trucks pulled out. After we passed, he snapped the lock shut,

2518
02:50:03.48 --> 02:50:13.24
closing some of the darkest chapters in my life. They continued this train planes and

2519
02:50:13.24 --> 02:50:18.60
automobiles to try and get to freedom. We boarded and finally we get to we boarded the trucks and

2520
02:50:18.60 --> 02:50:23.48
proceeded across a freedom bridge to freedom village. When we arrived, I didn't wait for the

2521
02:50:23.48 --> 02:50:29.24
tailgate to drop. I jumped right out onto the ground. There were two American escorts for each of us.

2522
02:50:29.24 --> 02:50:34.52
They grabbed me and I thought holy shit, these guys were big and muscular. I quickly realized

2523
02:50:34.52 --> 02:50:40.44
they were average guys. I was just a little skinny and at one point he gets on a scale and he

2524
02:50:40.44 --> 02:50:50.44
weighed 108 pounds. Our first stop was 10 city in a thousand yard neutral circle in the rice

2525
02:50:50.44 --> 02:50:58.44
patties. We stripped, we stripped, shoured and deloused. Having put on slippers and pajamas,

2526
02:50:58.44 --> 02:51:04.04
we were checked by good looking nurses. We stayed less than an hour before we moving to another building

2527
02:51:04.04 --> 02:51:10.04
to get uniforms and our first meal. After our meal, we were flown by helicopter to a replacement

2528
02:51:10.04 --> 02:51:16.28
depone in John. It was my first helicopter flight and I sat near the door and watched Korea pass

2529
02:51:16.28 --> 02:51:24.52
in a blurb of me. I felt like screaming, singing and dancing. But instead I remained subdued, quiet,

2530
02:51:24.52 --> 02:51:32.44
and happy inside. 57 years have passed and I can still remember how great it felt like being born

2531
02:51:32.44 --> 02:51:39.000
again. Then he gets on the phone and he says, I reach my dad. I could hear the excitement and

2532
02:51:39.000 --> 02:51:43.40
his voice he bombarded me with questions. Are you all right when you come in home? Don't worry about

2533
02:51:43.40 --> 02:51:50.76
me. I'll be okay. There was some kind of calmness inside of me that was difficult to describe.

2534
02:51:50.76 --> 02:51:59.32
I've been through so much that just being free and headed home was enough. After worrying about

2535
02:51:59.32 --> 02:52:05.08
living day in and day out, I wondered if anything would ever bother me in the future.

2536
02:52:07.08 --> 02:52:11.48
The voyage back to California on the Brewster, which was the ship there on was great. They

2537
02:52:11.48 --> 02:52:18.68
served three meals a day. The small things mattered more now than before. We were subjected to daily

2538
02:52:18.68 --> 02:52:25.40
debriefings, which were more like interrogations by intelligence officers. He goes through

2539
02:52:26.04 --> 02:52:29.24
answering a bunch of questions about what he saw and what he went through and they were actually

2540
02:52:29.24 --> 02:52:33.40
trying to figure out if there were more like how many other prisoners, water or other prisoners

2541
02:52:33.40 --> 02:52:41.32
that were left behind. He finishes those interrogations or those questioning or

2542
02:52:41.32 --> 02:52:47.000
intel gathering situations. And then for the rest of the voyage I stayed on the deck. I sucked

2543
02:52:47.000 --> 02:52:53.24
in the fresh sea air and basting the warm breeze. Everything I could hear, smell and see was so full of

2544
02:52:53.24 --> 02:52:59.64
life. As I looked over the rail the ship I remembered three years ago looking down at the sea

2545
02:52:59.64 --> 02:53:06.28
and praying that I would have the strength to lead my men in combat. Now I was returning by myself.

2546
02:53:06.28 --> 02:53:13.80
I've been born again a chance to live for tomorrow to make the most of every day and never look

2547
02:53:13.80 --> 02:53:23.08
back. I had survived the greatest laboratory of human behavior, one that no education could ever equal.

2548
02:53:26.04 --> 02:53:30.92
Weeks later the Golden Gate bridge jutted out of the fog as the ship pulled into port.

2549
02:53:30.92 --> 02:53:38.60
We had a few hours before our flight so I left and walked around the post. My path took me

2550
02:53:38.60 --> 02:53:46.04
to the post cemetery. It was very quiet and my thoughts were on all of the men and friends

2551
02:53:46.04 --> 02:53:55.40
that were no longer with me. Walsh, grrrr, smoke. I could feel them standing above me.

2552
02:53:55.40 --> 02:54:03.64
I hope they were smiling and happy for me because it was my men, my section that had kept me motivated

2553
02:54:03.64 --> 02:54:15.32
and alive. I owed my freedom and survival to them. A number of us food is Chicago where we changed

2554
02:54:15.32 --> 02:54:20.76
planes when the plane left Chicago is the only returning prisoner of war aboard. Although the

2555
02:54:20.76 --> 02:54:26.12
plane was full of people I felt very lonely, I was free and on my way home with mixed emotions,

2556
02:54:26.12 --> 02:54:31.48
I realized that I had just left men that I had lived with 24 hours a day for 34 months.

2557
02:54:33.56 --> 02:54:37.88
They were sad that with all the freedom surrounding me that there was an empty feeling.

2558
02:54:40.04 --> 02:54:48.28
There were also thoughts of the ones who had never returned. The ones whose lives had been lost

2559
02:54:48.28 --> 02:54:57.72
almost before they began. When we landed in Philadelphia the stewardess asked if we would remain

2560
02:54:57.72 --> 02:55:01.32
seated for just a minute while a special passenger exited the plane.

2561
02:55:02.84 --> 02:55:09.32
To my surprise that special passenger was me. I walked down the stairs and onto the tarmac.

2562
02:55:10.92 --> 02:55:16.20
Waiting there were my mother and father. They hugged him kissed me.

2563
02:55:16.20 --> 02:55:22.76
This time, unlike on the street before the war, I realized the act of affection between

2564
02:55:22.76 --> 02:55:29.000
father and son was a wonderful thing. I will never forget the emotion on my father's face

2565
02:55:29.80 --> 02:55:31.40
as tears well-dup in his eyes.

2566
02:55:31.40 --> 02:55:50.92
He goes on and there is a whole story with a story in this about a woman that was an associate

2567
02:55:50.92 --> 02:56:00.20
a friend and several others and there's a whole other realm to this. But he starts to get back on

2568
02:56:00.20 --> 02:56:04.04
with his life a little bit back to the book while I was absorbing the sounds and sights of freedom.

2569
02:56:04.04 --> 02:56:09.24
I was beginning to think about my future. I had been given a second chance and was determined

2570
02:56:09.24 --> 02:56:15.16
that I was not going to blow it. Claire and I had become inseparable and I was falling in love with

2571
02:56:15.16 --> 02:56:20.76
her. My only fear was that the feeling might not be mutual. We had a wonderful Christmas holiday

2572
02:56:20.76 --> 02:56:24.92
and both realized that we were definitely meant to be together during a New Year's Eve party.

2573
02:56:24.92 --> 02:56:32.12
I gave Claire an engagement ring. She said yes. We announced to everyone that we were going to be married.

2574
02:56:34.68 --> 02:56:40.84
There were happy people, sad people, and mad people to tell the story behind this statement

2575
02:56:40.84 --> 02:56:45.96
would take another book but five children and 56 years later were still happily married.

2576
02:56:45.96 --> 02:56:59.64
From there, this is like, as I was researching this whole situation, this is so he gets done with us

2577
02:57:00.76 --> 02:57:06.76
and he ends up going to Officer Candidate School in the Army. He gets assigned to the

2578
02:57:06.76 --> 02:57:14.76
500 fifth airborne infantry regiment. That's fine. Awesome. Just outstanding. Then he goes to special

2579
02:57:14.76 --> 02:57:24.52
forces at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. He becomes a Greenbrain special forces guy. He goes to Vietnam.

2580
02:57:27.56 --> 02:57:36.92
The two-time commander of Project Delta in Vietnam, which is the deep reconnaissance.

2581
02:57:36.92 --> 02:57:45.32
The format, this is how we do deep reconnaissance. This is based on Project Delta.

2582
02:57:45.32 --> 02:57:50.04
Project Delta was also back within it, Charlie Beckworth, who is the founder of Delta Force.

2583
02:57:52.92 --> 02:57:59.48
Richardson just drives on and does deployments to Vietnam going into

2584
02:57:59.48 --> 02:58:07.16
enemy territory, deep enemy territory. He ends up doing 39 years in the Army.

2585
02:58:11.32 --> 02:58:20.12
Like you said, the wife and the kids and the incredible career. After that,

2586
02:58:20.12 --> 02:58:28.92
had a civilian, he's still alive. Then here's what he closes out with. He says every day,

2587
02:58:29.72 --> 02:58:36.20
on this journey, I believed the men of the weapons platoon and my close buddies in prison were watching

2588
02:58:36.20 --> 02:58:43.56
me to see how I looked after my men and prepared them for whatever they may have had to face.

2589
02:58:43.56 --> 02:58:50.36
I tried my best to make them proud of me.

2590
02:58:58.28 --> 02:59:07.88
So, well, I think that Colonel Richardson, I think we can absolutely answer in the affirmative

2591
02:59:07.88 --> 02:59:18.76
that, yes, I think anyone would be proud of how you handled yourself, how you led, and then on top

2592
02:59:18.76 --> 02:59:28.76
of that, how you lived your life. I mean, I think that's just self-evident in every page of this

2593
02:59:28.76 --> 02:59:36.12
book, which once again, valleys of death is an unbelievable book. It should be handed out to people,

2594
02:59:36.12 --> 02:59:43.40
it should be issued in the military, as far as I'm concerned. And I mean, I think in reading the book,

2595
02:59:45.48 --> 02:59:53.000
I mean, it's like your actions, Colonel Richardson's actions is behavior. I mean, how can you not be,

2596
02:59:53.000 --> 02:59:57.08
how can you not think to yourself that you can do a little bit better with the situation that you're in?

2597
02:59:57.08 --> 03:00:10.84
And realize how much human beings are capable of. I don't, I don't see how you could read this

2598
03:00:10.84 --> 03:00:17.40
and not walk away and say, you know what, I'm going to do better. And whatever situation you're

2599
03:00:17.40 --> 03:00:23.32
in looking, I know people end up in the horrible situations, but no matter what that situation is,

2600
03:00:23.32 --> 03:00:32.92
no matter what it is, you can move forward. You can move forward. You can keep your mind

2601
03:00:32.92 --> 03:00:42.68
positive. You can use your mind as your weapon. And also, you can, you know, one of the parts

2602
03:00:42.68 --> 03:00:47.72
in that's encompassed, and that is like, oh, you can actually have fun and keep your sense of humor

2603
03:00:47.72 --> 03:00:51.80
when you're going through these terrible situations, which people ask me that all the time,

2604
03:00:51.80 --> 03:00:56.20
like, don't you, do you think it's important to have a sense of humor? Of course I do. You know,

2605
03:00:56.20 --> 03:01:05.40
of course I do. But again, Colonel Richardson, if you ever hear this, obviously, there is a

2606
03:01:05.40 --> 03:01:13.24
wide open invite for you to come and debrief us and teach us life lessons here and tell us about

2607
03:01:13.24 --> 03:01:18.44
tell us more detail. And the parts that I know I missed and things that I messed up, I apologize,

2608
03:01:18.44 --> 03:01:25.80
but thanks for your service, thanks for your sacrifice and thanks for showing us,

2609
03:01:28.12 --> 03:01:35.56
showing us how to live properly, even in the most dire circumstances.

2610
03:01:35.56 --> 03:01:48.20
With that, that was low. Yeah, I was reading this book and it was just, I couldn't stop.

2611
03:01:48.84 --> 03:01:54.04
I couldn't stop. I couldn't stop. It's one of those books. You just don't, you just don't see.

2612
03:01:54.76 --> 03:02:01.80
It's, it's so hard to understand. Like, some of that combat in the beginning is crazy. It's crazy.

2613
03:02:01.80 --> 03:02:08.44
Just the situation that they were in. I mean, you're surrounded by the Chinese for three days

2614
03:02:08.44 --> 03:02:12.28
and they're just hammering your perimeter on night with waves, human waves.

2615
03:02:14.44 --> 03:02:21.48
And then you get the note drop from a, from a damn plane that says, no relief is coming. Find your way out.

2616
03:02:22.52 --> 03:02:30.68
I appreciate it. Yeah. And then you got to leave your wounded. That's, that's what happens. It's like,

2617
03:02:30.68 --> 03:02:37.40
okay, we either all die. I mean, this is just like, it's incredible. It's incredible. And you should read this.

2618
03:02:37.40 --> 03:02:41.80
So you get some sort of semblance of maybe what your thoughts are going to be when you,

2619
03:02:41.80 --> 03:02:52.20
if you get into a situation like that, whatever it is. So yeah, always learning, always, and for me,

2620
03:02:52.20 --> 03:02:56.36
again, I get done with this and I can't even sleep. Because I think to myself,

2621
03:02:56.36 --> 03:03:02.60
I got so much opportunity as a guess what, oh, I wake up and I can walk around. I don't have

2622
03:03:02.60 --> 03:03:09.32
strap on my back. I get to eat food, whatever you like, whatever you want, whatever you want.

2623
03:03:10.52 --> 03:03:15.40
That's true. Like, people complain about working out. People complain like,

2624
03:03:16.04 --> 03:03:19.24
I don't feel like working out. What are you talking about? I got a good idea. Why don't you just

2625
03:03:19.24 --> 03:03:24.84
be quiet? Just stop. People complain that they got to go to work. Guess what? You're blessed.

2626
03:03:24.84 --> 03:03:28.92
You're lucky. You get to go to work. Yeah. You're lucky.

2627
03:03:28.92 --> 03:03:33.48
I'm proud to think about that yesterday. The working out thing. I like people complain.

2628
03:03:34.44 --> 03:03:38.84
Only because my arm, you have your situations that keep you from working out or training.

2629
03:03:38.84 --> 03:03:43.000
Yeah. And I'm not up. Like, did you check yourself when you get it? Well,

2630
03:03:43.80 --> 03:03:49.96
it was a moment of appreciation. But it was. So you know, when you get, you get injured or sick.

2631
03:03:49.96 --> 03:03:55.16
And you feel yourself getting better. Like, oh, shoot. Like, I'm marked, you know,

2632
03:03:55.16 --> 03:03:58.92
like, today, I felt better than I felt this whole time. Kind of thing. And you get,

2633
03:03:58.92 --> 03:04:05.40
that's when the waves of appreciation come back. Back. You know what? The thing is also for

2634
03:04:05.40 --> 03:04:08.84
those people that, you know, when you get an injury, you think it's going to last forever.

2635
03:04:08.84 --> 03:04:12.44
This one feels like, oh, that feels like it's last forever. And then you realize,

2636
03:04:12.44 --> 03:04:18.20
when you get back, you kind of forget that it even happened. Yeah. So yeah. So the eating,

2637
03:04:18.20 --> 03:04:24.52
and that's a big part every time he mentions eating or starving or all the weight that he lost.

2638
03:04:24.52 --> 03:04:31.40
And we're 180 pounds. Yeah. So that for whatever reason, those that affects me a lot when I hear it.

2639
03:04:31.40 --> 03:04:36.12
It like, oh, man. Because you picture your biceps. What? Yeah. So I think it makes you crush yourself.

2640
03:04:36.76 --> 03:04:42.12
Crushed yourself. Well, you know, just being hungry the whole time. You know, yeah.

2641
03:04:42.12 --> 03:04:49.16
Like, what's the longest you've fasted for? On like 24 hours. Like, yeah, you need to get your 72.

2642
03:04:49.16 --> 03:04:55.56
Hmm. I don't know. I don't know. Because you're saying for me, because because being hungry goes away after

2643
03:04:55.56 --> 03:05:00.44
the one I'm not. Yeah. I haven't done. I haven't done hunger for 34 months. Yeah.

2644
03:05:01.16 --> 03:05:06.52
Well, it goes away like after like seven hours. I think or subsides like to me in my experience,

2645
03:05:06.52 --> 03:05:11.72
it depends on you who you are. I'm sure. But I've had about four or five hours. That's when that's

2646
03:05:11.72 --> 03:05:17.96
peak hunger in my experience. But either way. So you know, when he gets that, like he gets, you know,

2647
03:05:17.96 --> 03:05:24.28
I can't even believe, just so everyone knows we are in no stretch of the any sort of imagination.

2648
03:05:24.28 --> 03:05:31.88
Trying to compare a fast for 24 hours with 34 months, 34 months. And I mean, look at look at

2649
03:05:31.88 --> 03:05:36.84
cap plums six years. I don't know. I helped me eat rice ball in the morning and rice ball in the

2650
03:05:36.84 --> 03:05:45.24
evening with filled with wood chips. What's up wood chips? You know what, you go to a restaurant right

2651
03:05:45.24 --> 03:05:50.20
now. If your rice is like slightly overcooked, you're complaining. Like, can you put it in your

2652
03:05:50.20 --> 03:05:57.56
back? Yeah. Never mind bugs and wood chips in there. Yeah, no, no, it's typically, you know. Yeah,

2653
03:05:57.56 --> 03:06:05.96
it's, yeah, that's rough to say the least. But now, you know, and I look, I'm living, you know,

2654
03:06:05.96 --> 03:06:10.20
we're living kind of this journey with him in a small way, right? And the piece, you know,

2655
03:06:11.16 --> 03:06:16.68
they come to you know, peace agreement. So he's back on the boat, feeling the warm air, eating

2656
03:06:16.68 --> 03:06:23.64
three times a day. Man, it makes you think like now, okay, with 2018, right? But there's like

2657
03:06:23.64 --> 03:06:30.92
more than one, too. There's many, many apps on your phone that you can be like, hey, I want a triple burger

2658
03:06:31.56 --> 03:06:37.88
double cheese bacon, bacon avocado and you know what I'm going to grill the onions and I'm going to

2659
03:06:37.88 --> 03:06:43.48
need that the grass fed. Yeah, yeah, I'm just saying this kind of steak isn't quite good enough for me over here.

2660
03:06:44.20 --> 03:06:48.76
And by the way, can I get the what's that special kind of mayonnaise that has like something else in it?

2661
03:06:48.76 --> 03:06:55.56
Well, there's a few. So it's called an a-o-least. Yeah, the a-o-least. Yeah, the a-o-least. Yeah, the a-o-least.

2662
03:06:55.56 --> 03:07:00.04
Other normal mayonnaise isn't quite in your, you know, you need to stop it. But we just don't want

2663
03:07:00.04 --> 03:07:04.44
that one. Yeah, we don't want that one. We want the good one. So, and so let me go ahead and click this button.

2664
03:07:04.44 --> 03:07:08.28
So spoiled. Yeah. And then it comes to your door. Yeah, about 15 minutes.

2665
03:07:08.28 --> 03:07:13.64
Somebody brings their 15 minutes. Yeah, true, drive seven. If it's even, if it's 22 minutes, you're kind of mad.

2666
03:07:13.64 --> 03:07:21.000
Kind of. That's like, you know, I was hungry. Yeah. You know what you know that? And it'll say 10 to 22 minutes on that.

2667
03:07:21.000 --> 03:07:26.44
Like people, people, they get separated from their phone. And they freak out, right?

2668
03:07:27.32 --> 03:07:34.60
I mean, you imagine this, like what you would even know. What's happening anything in the world. You know nothing.

2669
03:07:34.60 --> 03:07:38.36
You know nothing of what's happening in the world. And that's something with your family.

2670
03:07:38.36 --> 03:07:48.28
Yeah. Nothing. Yeah. So with this, since other people have suffered through that,

2671
03:07:48.28 --> 03:07:56.92
you may be in in our grid. You can, you can try and get yourself on a little bit better of a path

2672
03:07:56.92 --> 03:08:01.72
with a little bit more discipline in the world as what I'm saying. I know I need to step it up.

2673
03:08:01.72 --> 03:08:06.92
Harger, you know, to do more, trying to make more stuff happen. Yeah. Because the opportunities

2674
03:08:06.92 --> 03:08:12.76
they're thinking about. You know, and the crazy thing is, Richardson's one of the people that survived

2675
03:08:13.88 --> 03:08:18.52
because there's thousands upon thousands that didn't that died of diarrhea,

2676
03:08:19.72 --> 03:08:26.60
that died of dysentery, that died of gangrene and infections. Yeah. So,

2677
03:08:27.80 --> 03:08:33.56
man, we got it made. So, you know what, we got it made. So make something. How's that sound? We got

2678
03:08:33.56 --> 03:08:38.28
it made. So make something of what you got, which is everything. Which is everything, by the way, unless

2679
03:08:38.28 --> 03:08:47.32
you're in a next to, unless you're drowning in a trench full of shit, a 108 pounds with no

2680
03:08:47.32 --> 03:08:52.92
with your legs not working with scars in your back. Unless you're in that situation,

2681
03:08:52.92 --> 03:08:57.48
how about you step up and just start moving in the right direction? We're doing all right.

2682
03:08:57.48 --> 03:09:05.000
Yeah. And the helpful or what makes it helpful is perspective when you put into perspective.

2683
03:09:05.000 --> 03:09:08.92
Let's say you live in your life every day, you're all used to it. We're all used to it.

2684
03:09:08.92 --> 03:09:14.20
And you don't feel like doing something. That's really what it comes down to. And of course,

2685
03:09:14.20 --> 03:09:18.44
there's different levels of not feeling like doing something. It's like kind and not feeling like

2686
03:09:18.44 --> 03:09:22.68
just, or hey, that this is straight. I'm not going to happen today. Kind of feel it. Not,

2687
03:09:22.68 --> 03:09:27.24
I feel like doing something. So when you put it into perspective, I don't know if you can, like,

2688
03:09:27.24 --> 03:09:32.12
right after this book. No, it's not, it's not. It's a non-alternative. Exactly. It doesn't hold

2689
03:09:32.12 --> 03:09:38.28
zero water whatsoever. Exactly. Right. You can't get to a place that you don't feel like you can't

2690
03:09:38.28 --> 03:09:43.80
convince me ever that whatever you're saying is is even remotely ways in on the situation,

2691
03:09:43.80 --> 03:09:49.24
at all ever. Exactly. Right. That's where I don't want to, you know, whatever. Yeah, when you know,

2692
03:09:49.24 --> 03:09:54.68
it needs to get done. And you don't feel, let's say, oh, man, I haven't slept in two days. Let's say that.

2693
03:09:54.68 --> 03:09:59.000
That's legitimate in everyday life. Like, man, you get your restaurant. Oh, yeah. But if it needs

2694
03:09:59.000 --> 03:10:03.80
to be done after you read this book, let's say you didn't sleep because you read that book and

2695
03:10:03.80 --> 03:10:07.72
you read this up for two days. You really don't feel like going to the gym. I'll tell you that.

2696
03:10:10.84 --> 03:10:16.44
Physically, but I like to bring it back to just go and do an advice that workout.

2697
03:10:16.44 --> 03:10:25.000
That's whatever, you know, but I hope people I hope people as a bare minimum. I hope people use

2698
03:10:25.000 --> 03:10:31.56
the mindset you can pull from the from the perspective you get from this. I hope at a bare minimum

2699
03:10:31.56 --> 03:10:36.04
you get your workouts at the maximum. I hope you step up and just take over the world. Because it's

2700
03:10:36.04 --> 03:10:40.92
sitting there right in front of you. You're not locked behind barbed wire. You don't have your arms

2701
03:10:40.92 --> 03:10:45.56
as strong up behind your back and hung from the ceiling. So painful that you pass out. So painful

2702
03:10:45.56 --> 03:10:52.04
that you pass out. Which that's just what does that even mean? It means you can kind of do anything

2703
03:10:52.04 --> 03:10:59.000
really when you kind of put into perspective. So what are we doing? Being Dave Burke. Good deal,

2704
03:10:59.000 --> 03:11:05.16
dude. Yes. But you know, well, well, well, he does reads a lot of books to you and he just like,

2705
03:11:05.16 --> 03:11:10.76
man, we didn't. We just are suck. Yeah, we're just pathetic. Yeah, I could hear something. Yeah,

2706
03:11:10.76 --> 03:11:15.88
I'm like, yeah, it's just you can't even. Yeah. Like, I said him a note. I was wanting to know.

2707
03:11:15.88 --> 03:11:22.12
I was like, you did, hey, you had combat. You did combat flights in Afghanistan in Iraq. And he's like,

2708
03:11:24.12 --> 03:11:29.000
he's like, bro, come on. You know, that's just come on. And I'm like, well, he's like,

2709
03:11:29.000 --> 03:11:33.40
yeah, 10. I technically did I drop bombs in those countries. Yes, well, the way they consider

2710
03:11:33.40 --> 03:11:39.40
combat operations. And like, yeah, and he's like, but come on. He's like, he's like, I got two words for

2711
03:11:39.40 --> 03:11:44.36
you, Ewo Gima. And I was like, all right, I get it. But yeah, that's that's how you feel when you get

2712
03:11:44.36 --> 03:11:50.84
done with something like this. And then by the way, he's got a one, one half of a paragraph,

2713
03:11:50.84 --> 03:11:54.20
where he's like, oh, by the way, I did 39 years new army. And by the way, I was in Vietnam. And by the

2714
03:11:54.20 --> 03:12:00.92
way, I was in charge of project delta for two times twice. Yeah. It's not like a little sub. That's

2715
03:12:00.92 --> 03:12:07.000
like a little, a little, like I just a little sub note, a little PS, a little post script. Yeah,

2716
03:12:07.000 --> 03:12:12.36
geez. Talk about getting out of the way. That should be its own book. Each one of those command

2717
03:12:12.36 --> 03:12:18.60
tours is its own book about doing deep reconnaissance in the Vietnam. Are you kidding me? Yeah.

2718
03:12:19.24 --> 03:12:24.92
I didn't even make the cut for the colonel. Yeah. This is said, um, I'm just gonna, yeah, whatever.

2719
03:12:24.92 --> 03:12:32.44
I was like, oh, no, I talked about it. I put a pair of a half a paragraph. Yeah. So he not only did

2720
03:12:32.44 --> 03:12:41.08
he power through it. He went back. Yeah. Cheese. Let's, let's hit me. And he did power through it

2721
03:12:41.08 --> 03:12:47.40
by the way. Yeah. He didn't like, no, he held the line. Yeah. He powered through. He didn't, yeah.

2722
03:12:47.40 --> 03:12:51.24
That part where he's talking about, don't let them laugh at you. Don't let them laugh at you.

2723
03:12:51.24 --> 03:12:55.72
I like, I underlined that and highlighted it and then I put stars by it. Because that's the kind of

2724
03:12:55.72 --> 03:13:01.96
thing that you think about like, like, we know the world sometimes seems like it's having a joke

2725
03:13:01.96 --> 03:13:05.24
with you. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, like it's playing like the joke is on you. You ever wake up

2726
03:13:05.24 --> 03:13:09.24
you like the joke is on the jokes on me and everything. Everything. Laughing at me. That's everything.

2727
03:13:09.24 --> 03:13:15.96
Like that's not a good feeling, right? No. Let that happen. No, you don't. And yeah. Thank you.

2728
03:13:17.000 --> 03:13:19.72
See you in keeping the sense of humor all this time. Yeah. Man.

2729
03:13:21.24 --> 03:13:27.16
So it's a humor laughing. It was a shitty situation. It was a situation. Yes, sir. It was never next time

2730
03:13:27.16 --> 03:13:33.000
you think about something being shitty. Now you know what a true shitty situation is. We all knew

2731
03:13:33.000 --> 03:13:38.04
now we all now have a new definition of what a shitty situation is. That's it. That's the standard.

2732
03:13:38.04 --> 03:13:46.76
And that's it. That's the standard. That's where you're at. Yeah. So well, yeah. So we're in the

2733
03:13:46.76 --> 03:13:51.000
path. Like there's no one's off the path anymore. No, I can't be. We can't. You're not allowed to

2734
03:13:51.000 --> 03:13:54.68
not even allowed. You're not allowed to. We're just on the path. All right. So when you when you

2735
03:13:54.68 --> 03:13:59.48
start duty to if you haven't already, which most of us have. Yeah. Holy cow. Most of us have.

2736
03:14:00.20 --> 03:14:05.64
Oh yeah. It's like everyone that's thinking that's still on the fence, right? Just just get over the

2737
03:14:05.64 --> 03:14:10.36
fence because every single person. I don't want to say every single person. There is a

2738
03:14:11.80 --> 03:14:18.28
what percentage. I've heard feedback. I think from a total feedback of three people. And it might

2739
03:14:18.28 --> 03:14:25.000
only be two that actually just didn't like it. You get to actually it's three. One female, two males.

2740
03:14:25.56 --> 03:14:30.20
The one, the one male I went back and forth with for a while. You know, he was like hitting me up

2741
03:14:30.20 --> 03:14:32.84
on Twitter. This was pretty early on. He's just like, I just don't like it. I'm like the person

2742
03:14:32.84 --> 03:14:38.60
I'm grinding on me. And and finally with that guy, he just didn't want to do it, man. And I was like,

2743
03:14:38.60 --> 03:14:43.64
look, you know, hey, cool. You don't want to ruin your life. You don't make this into a living hell

2744
03:14:43.64 --> 03:14:48.68
because you do some of you, you fully hate. It wasn't until the next guy that bitterly complained

2745
03:14:49.40 --> 03:14:53.96
that I was like, listen, okay, here's the point. Keep doing it until you submit someone once you

2746
03:14:53.96 --> 03:14:58.68
submit someone you can stop. I didn't think of that plan yet until the guy number two. And the other

2747
03:14:58.68 --> 03:15:04.92
one was a female that it was two things. It didn't really like it, but more important. Didn't

2748
03:15:04.92 --> 03:15:12.12
have anywhere to train and kind of just got off the path. But yeah. So, but that's three out of many.

2749
03:15:12.12 --> 03:15:20.44
Yeah, many. Many. I mean, most people are like, oh, yeah. I'm obsessed now. I'm obsessed. Yeah,

2750
03:15:20.44 --> 03:15:25.24
winner loose. Like sometimes people would be like, hey, I got beat up for, for I don't have. Well,

2751
03:15:25.24 --> 03:15:30.36
everyone says just went to my first jujube to class. Got choked 28 times by a 14 year old kid.

2752
03:15:30.36 --> 03:15:34.68
Yeah, I love it. Yeah. You know, if you got your ego and check, you say I love it. You know,

2753
03:15:34.68 --> 03:15:38.60
got your ego and check your leg. But you know, I don't know if this is for me. I'll punch him.

2754
03:15:38.60 --> 03:15:42.28
Yeah, I'm trying punch him. Trying punch that 14 year old. See what that triangle feels like then.

2755
03:15:43.48 --> 03:15:49.24
You. Because it doesn't feel good. Yeah. People go hard. We read Dean go hard on a triangle on you.

2756
03:15:49.24 --> 03:15:54.44
Like actually offensively he did a triangle. Me. Yes, he was just showing me something. He locked that

2757
03:15:54.44 --> 03:16:00.44
triangle up. So tight. I felt it in my lower back. That doesn't even make sense. They move my spinal cord.

2758
03:16:01.16 --> 03:16:08.28
Yeah. Yeah. I don't. I don't. That. For sure. Yeah. But. All right. So we are doing jujitsu. That's kind of

2759
03:16:08.28 --> 03:16:12.76
a deal. Yeah. So what, Gigi, you get what Rash, Gard, do you get? Hey, look, there's plenty of

2760
03:16:12.76 --> 03:16:17.64
geese plenty of rash guards. That's not really all from origin. Yeah. There's only one. Well,

2761
03:16:18.52 --> 03:16:23.56
the good news is, and I was talking to some folks at the master about this few times actually. You know,

2762
03:16:23.56 --> 03:16:27.88
hey, what geese should I get? There's still asking that question. Well, that's the thing. They already

2763
03:16:27.88 --> 03:16:33.000
know the origin. Oh, now it's the one. So which one? Gee, which one? I get. I get whatever one you want.

2764
03:16:33.000 --> 03:16:36.92
More advanced in our quest. Yeah. Because it's not the kind even if you get the look, you know,

2765
03:16:36.92 --> 03:16:41.24
there's like levels if you even want to call them that. We'll say price point if you will. Like the

2766
03:16:41.24 --> 03:16:45.96
more expensive one. It's not the kind of where you get that. And then you come in as any white

2767
03:16:45.96 --> 03:16:50.44
color wants to like, oh, you're kind of flossing hard with that. That, you know, no, like if you get

2768
03:16:50.44 --> 03:16:54.76
it's not like enressing if you wear gold shoes and rest. Yeah, that's exactly right. It's not like that.

2769
03:16:54.76 --> 03:17:00.12
It's not like that. Or you die your hair. Or yes. Yeah. That's a little statement. Right. That's a statement.

2770
03:17:00.12 --> 03:17:05.88
Yeah. These are not like that. Right orange hair. Yeah. I'm really good. Yeah. The geese not like that. No.

2771
03:17:05.88 --> 03:17:10.36
No, sir. He's just a geofunctional. Yeah. You know, maybe, you know, I don't obviously, I don't

2772
03:17:10.36 --> 03:17:15.56
go with P and be like, hey, what are we doing this? This is a particular. So I don't know, but I'm assuming

2773
03:17:15.56 --> 03:17:20.36
maybe it took more to make certain ones or whatever, but get the the point is get whichever one you want.

2774
03:17:20.36 --> 03:17:28.68
Yeah. Straight up. Yeah. lightweight, heavyweight, whatever. From origin main.com. True. True. Also,

2775
03:17:28.68 --> 03:17:37.000
you got um, rash cards if you want a rash card that you can get a lip. Shit. Rascard. You got

2776
03:17:37.88 --> 03:17:45.16
T shirts as well at from origin. So basically, like clothing. Yes, what we're making right now at this time.

2777
03:17:46.20 --> 03:17:52.20
Denham. Yeah. Yeah. You guess you said you're a very good. No. I'm double. I'm getting my I haven't

2778
03:17:52.20 --> 03:17:56.92
gotten my period. But yeah, we're making jeans. So just be on standby. It's going to take a little while to

2779
03:17:56.92 --> 03:18:03.96
get that ramped up. But look at the I saw pictures. Yeah. Oh, yeah. It's already posted them. Yeah. So

2780
03:18:03.96 --> 03:18:09.88
we will be we'll be make because you know why because everyone needs every human where's jeans.

2781
03:18:10.44 --> 03:18:16.52
Yeah. Because they're functional. Yeah. So every human needs jeans. Yeah. And if everyone does

2782
03:18:16.52 --> 03:18:23.96
then why not get jeans that are made here, made with the highest quality. Not all that stuff anyways.

2783
03:18:23.96 --> 03:18:29.48
So yeah, jeans are common. We also got some supplements. Yep. Jocquo supplements. So what?

2784
03:18:29.48 --> 03:18:36.28
Joint warfare, krill oil, discipline, mulk and worry kid mulk. So what do these cover?

2785
03:18:37.000 --> 03:18:44.84
The most important elements I think of slept supplementation. So joints. Those are going to go out on you.

2786
03:18:44.84 --> 03:18:50.04
That's if you're into lifting heavy and did you do hard? You in to you work cart if you have like a

2787
03:18:50.04 --> 03:18:55.48
manual labor type job. Yep. Moving company. Yeah. I know you were a mover. I was American

2788
03:18:55.48 --> 03:19:01.96
balancer balancer that that wasn't very hard to make. I mean you don't work around. Yes, on your

2789
03:19:01.96 --> 03:19:07.80
like feet and knees maybe depending. But I would say you know just when you're I would say the work

2790
03:19:07.80 --> 03:19:12.60
cops. The workouts get you joints. I think especially over time especially if you're going very often.

2791
03:19:12.60 --> 03:19:19.32
And here's one of the things about the joint stuff. A big part of it is you don't realize how much

2792
03:19:19.32 --> 03:19:25.56
the how much benefit there is to taking krill oil and joint warfare on a regular basis until you do it.

2793
03:19:25.56 --> 03:19:30.36
Yeah, and to all into or into you stop. Oh yeah, big time. Which I haven't stopped. I can't even answer

2794
03:19:30.36 --> 03:19:35.48
that question. But you've told us. Yes. I've stopped. Yes. So you had joint warfare, krill oil,

2795
03:19:35.48 --> 03:19:40.28
discipline which discipline like during the master hydrant call out of discipline. Because like

2796
03:19:40.28 --> 03:19:45.08
you know it's like go time the whole time. Yeah. So that's what now we got something else coming out.

2797
03:19:45.08 --> 03:19:51.72
We got discipline in little pills. Go pills. And I'll tell you why. I can't always pound

2798
03:19:53.08 --> 03:19:59.40
a bunch of discipline drink before let's say I'm going out to speak. Sure. I don't want to have to like

2799
03:19:59.40 --> 03:20:05.16
hit the head in the middle of the speech because I drink like a bottle of water right before I went out there.

2800
03:20:05.16 --> 03:20:08.68
So anyways, I was like hey can we make these things in little pills that I can take that can

2801
03:20:08.68 --> 03:20:13.000
kind of get me in the rock and roll mode real quick. So yeah got those coming out. That's not

2802
03:20:13.000 --> 03:20:17.64
to mention you got to mix it up and stuff. Which is in a big deal. But if you're on the Google

2803
03:20:17.64 --> 03:20:23.48
Go Go. Yeah. So yeah discipline go go pills coming and they got a little bit of new

2804
03:20:23.48 --> 03:20:28.52
trope again. They got a little bit of caffeine and they got a little bit of go. That's the main ingredient.

2805
03:20:28.52 --> 03:20:37.80
The meeting ingredient is go. Hey, also okay. So as we know the warrior kid mook is live and

2806
03:20:37.80 --> 03:20:44.04
as we also know is tasting. Well it's live or it's live. So it was this morning I was

2807
03:20:45.000 --> 03:20:51.72
I was making some strawberry mook for the kids for me but it's the kids mook and everyone in my house

2808
03:20:51.72 --> 03:20:57.08
is freaking going nuts. Everyone in my house is just drinking strawberry mook. Like, except for my

2809
03:20:57.08 --> 03:21:03.72
youngest daughter she's all about the chocolate. But somebody took the mook scoop from the

2810
03:21:03.72 --> 03:21:08.92
board and like they was gone. And this is when I realized there's something going on because

2811
03:21:08.92 --> 03:21:14.84
I said to my wife I said hey, where's I said hey, where's the scoop for the for the strawberry

2812
03:21:14.84 --> 03:21:23.24
quick? I actually called it strawberry quick because it tastes the yeah. And now now I was talking

2813
03:21:23.24 --> 03:21:28.52
to Brian and Brian's got people are like notifying him that they're getting like the nostalgic

2814
03:21:28.52 --> 03:21:35.56
memories of drinking Nestle's quick because that's when we're at the strawberry one. The

2815
03:21:35.56 --> 03:21:40.44
chocolate one doesn't taste as much like it tastes delicious but it doesn't taste the same like

2816
03:21:40.44 --> 03:21:46.36
whatever. Like they like exactly like quick does because that quick less faces isn't really

2817
03:21:46.36 --> 03:21:52.12
that great but the strawberry quick is great. Our chocolate is probably better than the Nestle's chocolate.

2818
03:21:52.12 --> 03:21:57.24
The strawberry quick is almost a replica and this is is illegal to for me to say this is like

2819
03:21:57.24 --> 03:22:03.000
comparing the brands or something like no man. Okay well legally yeah no no no all good.

2820
03:22:03.000 --> 03:22:08.12
And then nostalgia part that is that is something and I felt that you the wapart the Nestle's

2821
03:22:08.12 --> 03:22:12.92
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yes yes you don't want to get from the 7-11 yeah

2822
03:22:12.92 --> 03:22:18.36
strawberry quick from the 7-11 yeah we got it from a store called big safe uncle I

2823
03:22:18.36 --> 03:22:24.84
oh yeah yeah yeah yeah of course you do but yeah that's for you for the protein and the regular mook

2824
03:22:24.84 --> 03:22:30.04
that's for the protein so oh so there's the other thing I wanted to say as soon as I had

2825
03:22:30.68 --> 03:22:37.48
the warrior can strawberry mook I texted Brian 14 seconds later and said make a dope

2826
03:22:38.12 --> 03:22:44.44
you know mook strawberry so it's in the works oh yeah there's a couple there's

2827
03:22:45.64 --> 03:22:49.48
you can't just say well I'll just double up because there's a little bit more protein in it

2828
03:22:49.48 --> 03:22:55.32
and the you want you want to get a little bit more protein in the adult mook yeah yeah yeah that's

2829
03:22:55.32 --> 03:23:00.52
you can close you that are freaking out in the meantime take two scoops of two scoops of

2830
03:23:00.52 --> 03:23:07.72
warrior kid mook and you still do it all right yeah yeah yeah also if you want to represent

2831
03:23:09.40 --> 03:23:16.68
the discipline equals freedom way because this one does equal freedom I think the more you grow

2832
03:23:16.68 --> 03:23:22.28
up in life and embrace the discipline you understand that more because there are there are levels

2833
03:23:22.28 --> 03:23:28.68
of understanding to the core to the core anyway if you want to represent go to jocco store dot

03:27:20.76 --> 03:27:26.12
donut you don't need to no just don't need to so that'll help you out and we're also making a

2875
03:27:27.000 --> 03:27:31.96
second psychological warfare album and if you want that then you can uh if you want to if you want

2876
03:27:31.96 --> 03:27:37.48
if you have a special request for that should I do some stop smoking cigarettes I've never smoked

2877
03:27:37.48 --> 03:27:43.80
cigarettes I think you should at least yeah do it and then if it's like yeah because I would think

2878
03:27:43.80 --> 03:27:47.64
but as far as potential problems you might run into like you know how like on the other ones

2879
03:27:47.64 --> 03:27:52.20
like you can I get you can relate so you know kind of what to say about it you know like hey

2880
03:27:52.20 --> 03:27:57.64
you're thinking this or whatever yeah with a smoking maybe you could compare it to something maybe

2881
03:27:57.64 --> 03:28:01.48
felt that you might be addicted to in the past but I don't know I think that's the whole

2882
03:28:01.48 --> 03:28:07.96
thing that's a whole different game I'm not already done like it's you know yeah but I think again

2883
03:28:07.96 --> 03:28:13.08
I think it's a different game to really like a crew tons and to be addicted to smoking I don't know

2884
03:28:13.08 --> 03:28:17.80
I've never smoked yeah well yeah that's what that one's available wherever you get MP3's

2885
03:28:17.80 --> 03:28:24.36
iTunes Google Play whatever you know also if you're on the path working out that's part of it

2886
03:28:24.92 --> 03:28:30.52
right my my four things working out was wonderful and you want to vary every workout so this is where

2887
03:28:30.52 --> 03:28:38.60
you get your kettlebells on it on it dot com com it's called on it dot com slash jocco slash jocco by the way

2888
03:28:38.60 --> 03:28:45.72
get some rings kettlebells a mace um um you got it the mace is dangerous if you don't know what you're

2889
03:28:45.72 --> 03:28:49.72
doing so yeah the mace is seem like they're not heavy yeah and you pick that thing up and you

2890
03:28:49.72 --> 03:28:52.76
like you're talking about the big what's the big long thing with the ball in the end called

2891
03:28:52.76 --> 03:28:56.36
oh that's the mace no I'm thinking about the club the club bells yeah the club bells are way more

2892
03:28:56.36 --> 03:29:00.44
dangerous than the mace yeah and that's what I'm saying where the club bells if you drop a club

2893
03:29:00.44 --> 03:29:05.24
bell on your toe you will lose your toe yeah and the work I think that should be called a toe

2894
03:29:05.24 --> 03:29:09.32
remover you're in a hospital and you're like oh you got a bad toe we're gonna have to remove it

2895
03:29:09.32 --> 03:29:15.32
okay cool come over here whack that things gone I like to work out barefoot sometimes yeah

2896
03:29:15.32 --> 03:29:21.08
and like you yes a dangerous proposition so be careful just be yeah and really I mean a sane it

2897
03:29:21.08 --> 03:29:27.56
makes it sound like oh like almost more dangerous than a really my point is go on there and look

2898
03:29:27.56 --> 03:29:31.80
at the workouts first I know just because I've never done it and I still have all my toes I

2899
03:29:31.80 --> 03:29:36.12
will never I've worked out with a bunch and I still have all my toes so it's not that big of a deal

2900
03:29:36.12 --> 03:29:39.64
right but when you pick it up you're like dang this is kind of having the when you swing it and

2901
03:29:39.64 --> 03:29:43.96
you're like whoa whoa whoa let me get the smaller one yeah well that's how I was anyway but

2902
03:29:43.96 --> 03:29:48.44
anyway you can get that stuff there rings are a big deal in my opinion rings yeah definitely you

2903
03:29:48.44 --> 03:29:51.56
should have rings if you don't have rings you get them you see I said in my opinion like I

2904
03:29:51.56 --> 03:29:55.88
just know about the even though you were preaching rings from day one now I'm signed on to the

2905
03:29:55.88 --> 03:30:02.28
ring how's the big stability while still there's stable bad there's stable

2906
03:30:02.28 --> 03:30:08.04
overstable you know yeah I posted a picture of my son I don't really post that many pictures

2907
03:30:08.04 --> 03:30:13.80
like my kids all the time when I went to everyone's walk sure but he was lifting you know when

2908
03:30:13.80 --> 03:30:18.04
you lift and it's like he just jumps in and says my turn he does a dead lift that's pretty good

2909
03:30:18.04 --> 03:30:22.36
kids are good for him by the way yes they do so he does a dead lift on one of the little on it

2910
03:30:23.08 --> 03:30:30.84
cattle does a smaller one Z22 yeah and he's like watch me he did what was a wait 18 pounds how much

2911
03:30:30.84 --> 03:30:36.84
do you wait I don't know 18 pounds seems a little like it was like he did it easy

2912
03:30:36.84 --> 03:30:40.68
well anyway I don't know why why she wants you get him a bigger pedal he can start pushing the

2913
03:30:40.68 --> 03:30:44.36
envelope right but look we're not gonna raise your kidney we can know we're not talking I'm

2914
03:30:44.36 --> 03:30:47.64
just saying that's what he did at that time and I took a picture of it I'm not saying

2915
03:30:47.64 --> 03:30:52.68
we were maxing out me and my two-year-old Maxing out deadlift and he only could do eight

2916
03:30:52.68 --> 03:30:58.60
that's not what I'm seeing okay saying anyway I took a picture of it so you can see it okay

2917
03:30:58.60 --> 03:31:02.36
and it has I looked at the picture and I kind of evaluate I was like this is a good picture

2918
03:31:02.36 --> 03:31:06.84
because as like all the kettle the you know the sad it kind of scattered about you framed it out

2919
03:31:06.84 --> 03:31:11.000
well I'll technically I mean shoot be told I was making a video okay

2920
03:31:11.000 --> 03:31:17.88
which may or may not have were your kid's feet oh to it so while I was doing a

2921
03:31:17.88 --> 03:31:24.28
picture anyway it looks good on it was highly represented in that picture I liked it let me

2922
03:31:24.28 --> 03:31:31.24
tell you this maybe if you would give your kid some jockel white tea he would be able to

2923
03:31:31.24 --> 03:31:36.52
deadlift more than 18 pounds he would might be able to deadlift 8000 pound in fact there's an

2924
03:31:36.52 --> 03:31:41.88
actual guarantee because there's no aged minimum requirement if you get that kid on the jockel

2925
03:31:41.88 --> 03:31:47.88
white tea there's the 8000 pound deadlift actually my girl drink two drinks legitimate drinks

2926
03:31:47.88 --> 03:31:53.000
of my wife jockel white tea and she deadlift did 8000 there you go yeah what's okay later yeah

2927
03:31:53.000 --> 03:31:58.52
proven for sure kids everything jockel white tea you can get the cans which are ready to drink

2928
03:31:59.08 --> 03:32:04.44
or you can get the tea bags that you have to boil water to big oh god I don't know there's a

2929
03:32:04.44 --> 03:32:14.76
boiled water and in that then you have to seep you have to seep it put it in the morning I don't drink

2930
03:32:14.76 --> 03:32:19.88
jockel white tea warm in the morning every morning but there's certain such like at the

2931
03:32:19.88 --> 03:32:26.52
master oh I'm all about it and you know what does seep means you put the tea bag in there

2932
03:32:26.52 --> 03:32:30.84
and you let it sit for a little while and for some people they pull it out I just leave it in the

2933
03:32:30.84 --> 03:32:40.44
whole time you know Alan Alan stages oh Alan from yesterday master Alan he stages he stages like

2934
03:32:40.44 --> 03:32:48.36
when I get up to the podium it's staged and I was like so what what's good about that is it's

2935
03:32:48.36 --> 03:32:53.24
I don't know in the morning time we just have a little warm well guess it's hot technically it's hot

2936
03:32:53.24 --> 03:32:58.92
but I drink it warm yeah I don't know that there's a better beverage for that little morning

2937
03:32:58.92 --> 03:33:05.56
little morning scenario yeah this is a little morning snow just a little a couple of darker white tea so

2938
03:33:05.56 --> 03:33:14.60
you can get that also I got some books I got the way the warrior kid one end two and marks mission

2939
03:33:14.60 --> 03:33:26.12
it's one and two it's the same series and those books I get more incredible heartfelt feedback

2940
03:33:26.12 --> 03:33:35.32
on those two books then I could have ever imagined and it's awesome because kids can relate to

2941
03:33:35.32 --> 03:33:41.64
the books and it is great for the kids and it's great for the parents too and I get parents that

2942
03:33:41.64 --> 03:33:46.28
just say this is making me a better parent because it's all just a big it's all just a covered

2943
03:33:46.28 --> 03:33:49.72
move right I'm giving you this information you're you get to flank your kid because your

2944
03:33:49.72 --> 03:33:53.24
kids aren't going to listen to you not 100% they'll listen to you a little bit but that

2945
03:33:53.24 --> 03:33:58.84
listen to someone that they some some other person that seems like kind of tough you know that

2946
03:33:58.84 --> 03:34:03.40
they want to listen to Uncle Jake Uncle Jake starts telling them what to do and they're down

2947
03:34:03.40 --> 03:34:09.72
totally done and yeah so the warrior kid books one and two obviously get one first

2948
03:34:10.76 --> 03:34:14.84
because it's a it's a story and it kind of continues and you need to grow and it's going to continue

2949
03:34:14.84 --> 03:34:18.52
to grow we're going to see this we're going to see young Mark all the way through

2950
03:34:18.52 --> 03:34:26.20
through high school yeah and yeah so those books will help kids get on the path teach me about

2951
03:34:26.20 --> 03:34:29.48
this one teach them about hard work teach them about eating right teach them about study habits teach

2952
03:34:29.48 --> 03:34:33.56
about taking responsibility it's like everything that a kid needs to know to be quite honest

2953
03:34:33.56 --> 03:34:41.08
whether well this is and this is kind of mean I guess in a way so I've worried kid two

2954
03:34:41.08 --> 03:34:49.24
Mark's mission on repeat in the household helps that for my daughter's kindergarten they suggest

2955
03:34:49.24 --> 03:34:52.84
like all these things that you should do every day and you can kind of choose one and one is reading

2956
03:34:52.84 --> 03:34:57.000
no there you go for sure no matter time so I just read one chapter every single night

2957
03:34:57.000 --> 03:35:03.40
every single night as punishment I won't though which is very pretty rare that's pretty awesome though

2958
03:35:03.40 --> 03:35:08.60
yeah like if I's all threatened I had no chapter tonight you know she scrambles to you know

2959
03:35:08.60 --> 03:35:15.64
it's falling line anyway so the good thing about having it on repeat because obviously we finished

2960
03:35:15.64 --> 03:35:20.92
or whatever I'm on around two like towards the end of the book and she just knows she knows the

2961
03:35:20.92 --> 03:35:26.04
answers now you know she's still excited about it but yeah because well now she knows what's

2962
03:35:26.04 --> 03:35:31.56
all familiar you know so she kind of knows it's almost like now she's just fine I think she's yeah

2963
03:35:31.56 --> 03:35:36.68
that's amazing yeah that's amazing so that's the way the warrior kid and Mark's mission get it for

2964
03:35:36.68 --> 03:35:41.96
your kids get it for your neighbors kids get it for your kids across the streets kids oh I'm sorry

2965
03:35:41.96 --> 03:35:47.000
because why not just help kids out yeah and it does help what what does about say about I feel bad

2966
03:35:47.000 --> 03:35:53.24
because one night this was like two nights ago um she got this new unicorn book kids book I don't

2967
03:35:53.24 --> 03:35:57.40
know where she got it from school or something like this oh yeah from their library whatever you know

2968
03:35:57.40 --> 03:36:02.60
part of the book excited new unicorn book but I read that thing the thing is so lame it's a kindergarten

2969
03:36:02.60 --> 03:36:08.36
level book by the way and so I'm reading it and I'm thinking this thing is lame I'm looking at her

2970
03:36:08.36 --> 03:36:12.28
she's over there playing with Legos while I'm reading it's but she disengaged so quick it's

2971
03:36:12.28 --> 03:36:17.16
some nice yeah she was just off that's the warrior kid books back where all they want

2972
03:36:17.16 --> 03:36:22.28

2973
03:36:22.28 --> 03:36:29.40

2978
03:36:53.16 --> 03:36:59.40
because it keeps you on the path so this one equals freedom field manual then you got of course

2979
03:36:59.40 --> 03:37:06.52
extreme ownership uh which I wrote with my brother Dave Babin which is just universally

2980
03:37:06.52 --> 03:37:12.04
kind of becoming accepted as a as a as a book that you need to read as a leader and that's

2981
03:37:12.04 --> 03:37:17.08
followed up by the dichotomy leadership which just came out both those books New York times

2982
03:37:17.08 --> 03:37:21.24
both sellers both those books number one Wall Street Journal best sellers both those books

2983
03:37:21.24 --> 03:37:25.80
continue and to be almost less why be it's not that's not through but the big advertising campaign

2984
03:37:26.52 --> 03:37:30.68
that's just the word a mouth people get it for themselves and they get it for their teammate

2985
03:37:30.68 --> 03:37:34.36
then they get it up the chain of command down the chain of command get your get your uh

2986
03:37:35.48 --> 03:37:39.96
get your team in the game with the dichotomy leadership and an extreme ownership and then we got

2987
03:37:41.000 --> 03:37:45.72
Mikey in the dragons which comes out November so here's what it's about Mikey

2988
03:37:45.72 --> 03:37:54.60
young kid scared scared of everything finds a book the book that he finds it's called the dragon

2989
03:37:54.60 --> 03:37:59.24
prints and he scared to read it because there's pictures of scary dragons in it but then he gets

2990
03:37:59.24 --> 03:38:02.84
the courage to read it because he sees a little boy in there too that kind of looks like he knows

2991
03:38:02.84 --> 03:38:09.48
what's going on so he sees that little boy he goes how I'm going to read it so he reads the book

2992
03:38:09.48 --> 03:38:17.24
and in the book the dragon prints there's the king his dead and the boy is now the only one

2993
03:38:17.24 --> 03:38:23.16
that will defend the kingdom from the dragons that are over the hill in the dragon cave and the

2994
03:38:23.16 --> 03:38:27.96
boy is scared because he only seven years old and there's no one he's going to do goes and finds his

2995
03:38:27.96 --> 03:38:33.000
father's war chest pulls out the shield pulls out the sword they're too big for him and now he's

2996
03:38:33.000 --> 03:38:41.08
even more scared but then he sees a note in the bottom of the war chest and he picks up the note

2997
03:38:41.64 --> 03:38:50.04
and here's what it says after he finds this note it says to my son if you are reading this now

2998
03:38:50.04 --> 03:38:56.04
it means I am gone and you are the one that must carry on our kingdom is now what you must save

2999
03:38:56.04 --> 03:39:03.08
and to do that you have to be brave I know that you think you don't know what to do but remember

3000
03:39:03.08 --> 03:39:09.56
that I was once a little boy too I was also small and had fear in my heart and I didn't even

3001
03:39:09.56 --> 03:39:14.92
know where to start I couldn't imagine going over the hill to face the dragons that wanted to kill

3002
03:39:14.92 --> 03:39:21.40
but don't worry son you will be just fine if you can just keep these things in your mind

3003
03:39:21.40 --> 03:39:29.96
and then he goes on to explain to him how he can overcome his fear of the dragons and that's what

3004
03:39:29.96 --> 03:39:39.000
the prince does the prince stands up to his fears and faces the dragons and then the boy

3005
03:39:39.000 --> 03:39:46.60
Mikey learns from the lesson and you know we have to remember that we all have dragons to fight

3006
03:39:46.60 --> 03:39:51.64
so and also remember that this book is coming out on jockel publishing why is that the big

3007
03:39:51.64 --> 03:39:56.68
publishers couldn't get it out in time for kids to have for Christmas that's what I once I had

3008
03:39:56.68 --> 03:40:04.84
the book in my mind I wanted kids to have it by Christmas and the big publishers couldn't make it happen

3009
03:40:04.84 --> 03:40:10.92
because they're big you know they got a lot of moving pieces we're nimble over here you know

3010
03:40:10.92 --> 03:40:17.08
we're nimble so since they couldn't get it out time I had to kind of like they're a big dragon that's what they

3011
03:40:17.08 --> 03:40:23.48
are and so I had to kind of like stand up to the dragons and we can stand up to the dragons in our

3012
03:40:23.48 --> 03:40:30.28
own right with this with this book so if you want to help fight the dragons then grab a sword or

3013
03:40:30.28 --> 03:40:35.96
at least grab a copy and together we'll say the dragons you know also we got Ashlan front

3020
03:41:19.16 --> 03:41:23.32

3024
03:41:39.80 --> 03:41:44.04

03:43:16.60 --> 03:43:23.32

3041
03:43:24.20 --> 03:43:31.56
for our freedom and our security and here at home police law enforcement firefighters

3044
03:43:46.76 --> 03:43:54.28
Wherever you are and whatever it is that you do teachers investment bankers plumbers engineers

electricians doctors and nurses and builders and bricklayers and everyone else that is out there

3046
03:44:01.000 --> 03:44:11.56
making their way like I said earlier it can get hard sometimes that's the way life is and sometimes

3047
03:44:11.56 --> 03:44:19.80
you can actually hear life laughing at you sometimes but I say don't let it it's like when the

3048
03:44:19.80 --> 03:44:27.80
Chinese guards conducted a mock execution on Colonel Richardson and the other prisoners that he was

3049
03:44:27.80 --> 03:44:36.36
there with and then the guards they stood there and they were laughing they were laughing at these

3050
03:44:36.36 --> 03:44:41.40
terrified prisoners and the only didn't like that at the time the master sergeant he didn't

3051
03:44:41.40 --> 03:44:55.08
like that so he yelled he yelled get up don't let them laugh at you get up and I recommend

3052
03:44:55.08 --> 03:45:05.32
that if you feel like the world is laughing at you you do the same you get up and get after it

3053
03:45:05.32 --> 03:45:21.24
and until next time this is echo and jocco out
