00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.20
This is Jocobodcast number 102.

2
00:00:04.20 --> 00:00:06.80
With echo Charles and me, Jocobo willing.

3
00:00:06.80 --> 00:00:07.80
Good evening, Echo.

4
00:00:07.80 --> 00:00:08.80
Good evening.

5
00:00:08.80 --> 00:00:12.60
And we are rolling into some Q&A from the Interwebs.

6
00:00:12.60 --> 00:00:13.60
Sure.

7
00:00:13.60 --> 00:00:14.60
So let's go.

8
00:00:14.60 --> 00:00:16.40
Right to it.

9
00:00:16.40 --> 00:00:18.40
Jocobo.

10
00:00:18.40 --> 00:00:23.60
Is there ever good time to use an ultimatum?

11
00:00:23.60 --> 00:00:24.60
Hmm.

12
00:00:24.60 --> 00:00:26.60
That's a great question.

13
00:00:26.60 --> 00:00:29.60
And I think the answer is actually I think what everyone thinks about the answer.

14
00:00:29.60 --> 00:00:33.92
I think it's pretty self-evident.

15
00:00:33.92 --> 00:00:35.40
I think a lot of people will agree with it.

16
00:00:35.40 --> 00:00:36.40
Okay.

17
00:00:36.40 --> 00:00:38.36
So is there ever a good time to use an ultimatum?

18
00:00:38.36 --> 00:00:40.000
I think sometimes there is.

19
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.000
But it's seldom.

20
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Hmm.

21
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
It's actually very seldom.

22
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.36
But when enough is truly enough.

23
00:00:49.36 --> 00:00:50.36
Sure.

24
00:00:50.36 --> 00:00:52.84
Then you got to draw the line and you got to hold the line.

25
00:00:52.84 --> 00:00:53.84
Right.

26
00:00:53.84 --> 00:00:56.04
So you got to make an ultimatum.

27
00:00:56.04 --> 00:00:59.56
One thing that is extremely critical is that you should never make a line.

28
00:00:59.56 --> 00:01:03.16
You can ultimatum that you won't or can't keep.

29
00:01:03.16 --> 00:01:04.16
Right.

30
00:01:04.16 --> 00:01:05.16
Let's keep.

31
00:01:05.16 --> 00:01:06.16
Don't.

32
00:01:06.16 --> 00:01:07.16
The loft.

33
00:01:07.16 --> 00:01:10.68
If you say it, do it.

34
00:01:10.68 --> 00:01:15.80
And what's interesting from a job perspective?

35
00:01:15.80 --> 00:01:20.84
So like in the workplace perspective.

36
00:01:20.84 --> 00:01:22.68
Let's say up the chain of command.

37
00:01:22.68 --> 00:01:24.48
Up the chain of command, it's not good.

38
00:01:24.48 --> 00:01:25.48
Right.

39
00:01:25.48 --> 00:01:27.88
So let's say you're my boss and I come in and say echo.

40
00:01:27.88 --> 00:01:29.12
I want to raise.

41
00:01:29.12 --> 00:01:32.32
I want to buy this Friday or I'm out of here.

42
00:01:32.32 --> 00:01:33.32
Right.

43
00:01:33.32 --> 00:01:34.92
That's an ultimatum.

44
00:01:34.92 --> 00:01:37.32
And that means I'm trying to hold you hostage.

45
00:01:37.32 --> 00:01:40.20
Most people do not like being held hostage.

46
00:01:40.20 --> 00:01:46.20
So my chances of actually supporting what you're trying to make happen are very small.

47
00:01:46.20 --> 00:01:47.56
Because I'm actually mad at you.

48
00:01:47.56 --> 00:01:49.04
I don't want to support you.

49
00:01:49.04 --> 00:01:53.36
You're a big critical guy because you press record and you made some videos for me.

50
00:01:53.36 --> 00:01:54.36
You know what I mean?

51
00:01:54.36 --> 00:01:55.36
It's like that.

52
00:01:55.36 --> 00:01:57.56
But you're throwing an ultimatum at me?

53
00:01:57.56 --> 00:01:58.56
That's where we're at.

54
00:01:58.56 --> 00:02:00.68
The we couldn't have a conversation.

55
00:02:00.68 --> 00:02:01.68
We couldn't come to an agreement.

56
00:02:01.68 --> 00:02:03.68
So you're going to walk into me on the boss.

57
00:02:03.68 --> 00:02:04.68
I just reversed rules.

58
00:02:04.68 --> 00:02:06.68
So you're walking to me on the boss.

59
00:02:06.68 --> 00:02:13.28
You're going to say, joko, I want to raise and I want it now or I am out of here on Friday.

60
00:02:13.28 --> 00:02:14.28
That's my ultimatum.

61
00:02:14.28 --> 00:02:15.92
What are you doing?

62
00:02:15.92 --> 00:02:18.48
Are you building a relationship with me?

63
00:02:18.48 --> 00:02:19.48
No.

64
00:02:19.48 --> 00:02:24.24
Are you giving any room to negotiate or you giving yourself any room to maneuver?

65
00:02:24.24 --> 00:02:25.24
No.

66
00:02:25.24 --> 00:02:26.24
You're not.

67
00:02:26.24 --> 00:02:28.08
You're not going to be a self-ennewatum maneuver.

68
00:02:28.08 --> 00:02:31.32
So that one generally doesn't work very well.

69
00:02:31.32 --> 00:02:36.16
Now if you have another job offer that someone has put in front of you, that's legit

70
00:02:36.16 --> 00:02:40.56
and it's good and it's solid and you come into me and say, hey, joko, I've got another

71
00:02:40.56 --> 00:02:41.56
job offer.

72
00:02:41.56 --> 00:02:42.92
They wanted to answer by Friday.

73
00:02:42.92 --> 00:02:44.56
Here's what they're going to pay me.

74
00:02:44.56 --> 00:02:45.56
I'm not.

75
00:02:45.56 --> 00:02:46.56
This is enough thread.

76
00:02:46.56 --> 00:02:47.56
I'm not trying to be a jerk.

77
00:02:47.56 --> 00:02:48.68
I'm being straight up with you.

78
00:02:48.68 --> 00:02:52.32
But if you don't give me what I want by Friday, I'm going to have to leave and go because

79
00:02:52.32 --> 00:02:54.44
I got to improve my future.

80
00:02:54.44 --> 00:02:56.72
That's a, hey man, that sounds like a great deal of working for them.

81
00:02:56.72 --> 00:02:57.72
Go.

82
00:02:57.72 --> 00:02:59.72
Right?

83
00:02:59.72 --> 00:03:03.68
But that's an old-to-madeum, but it's a rational one.

84
00:03:03.68 --> 00:03:06.48
Because you actually have a backup and you actually are trying to be straight forward

85
00:03:06.48 --> 00:03:07.48
with me.

86
00:03:07.48 --> 00:03:10.96
So that's an old-to-madeum, but it's a logical one.

87
00:03:10.96 --> 00:03:15.12
Now down the chain of command, people don't like it.

88
00:03:15.12 --> 00:03:16.12
Old-to-madeum's either.

89
00:03:16.12 --> 00:03:24.12
For instance, you know, echo if you don't have this project done by Friday, you're

90
00:03:24.12 --> 00:03:25.12
fired.

91
00:03:25.12 --> 00:03:28.04
So now I put a big old-to-madeum on you.

92
00:03:28.04 --> 00:03:31.08
And you don't like that anymore than the boss.

93
00:03:31.08 --> 00:03:33.68
People don't like having old-to-madeum's put on it.

94
00:03:33.68 --> 00:03:38.64
So what you really do, if you have to use old-to-madeum's down the chain of command,

95
00:03:38.64 --> 00:03:41.04
you should check your leadership real real quick.

96
00:03:41.04 --> 00:03:42.68
Because you've made some mistakes, right?

97
00:03:42.68 --> 00:03:44.08
People don't understand the deadlines.

98
00:03:44.08 --> 00:03:46.000
People don't understand what it is you want them to do.

99
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.64
People don't understand why they're doing what they're doing.

100
00:03:47.64 --> 00:03:49.72
There's all kinds of things that they don't understand if you have to start throwing

101
00:03:49.72 --> 00:03:50.92
old-to-madeum's around.

102
00:03:50.92 --> 00:03:52.92
As a boss.

103
00:03:52.92 --> 00:04:00.84
So really, if you find yourself using old-to-madeum's, then you need to check your leadership.

104
00:04:00.84 --> 00:04:08.08
Now that being said, if you, if I've talked to you, if I've coached you, if I've

105
00:04:08.08 --> 00:04:12.000
counseled you, if I've done a written statement on you and told you exactly what it is

106
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.92
that I need echo-to-do.

107
00:04:14.92 --> 00:04:17.72
And now we've passed the point of no return.

108
00:04:17.72 --> 00:04:18.72
I go, okay, echo.

109
00:04:18.72 --> 00:04:20.12
Here's what I asked you to do.

110
00:04:20.12 --> 00:04:21.12
You didn't do it.

111
00:04:21.12 --> 00:04:22.60
This is the old-to-madeum.

112
00:04:22.60 --> 00:04:28.60
If you don't start making three videos a week, you are not going to be here anymore.

113
00:04:28.60 --> 00:04:33.28
And you'd say, you'd either say, okay, well, I'm going to do it.

114
00:04:33.28 --> 00:04:36.60
Or screwdriver, he's a jerk.

115
00:04:36.60 --> 00:04:37.60
I'm out of here.

116
00:04:37.60 --> 00:04:42.88
Either way, I've moved forward because you weren't doing it before.

117
00:04:42.88 --> 00:04:47.04
And that's sort of, I know that, that example is, yeah, kind of.

118
00:04:47.04 --> 00:04:48.04
It's close to home.

119
00:04:48.04 --> 00:04:53.04
So, ultimatums, be very, very careful.

120
00:04:53.04 --> 00:04:56.68
Make sure if you're going to use it, it's got to be real.

121
00:04:56.68 --> 00:05:01.08
You've got to enforce it and check yourself.

122
00:05:01.08 --> 00:05:04.96
Don't, don't get yourself in a position where you can't maneuver anymore.

123
00:05:04.96 --> 00:05:05.96
That's the biggest.

124
00:05:05.96 --> 00:05:08.28
That to me, that's the biggest point.

125
00:05:08.28 --> 00:05:10.80
You never want to take away your ability to move maneuver.

126
00:05:10.80 --> 00:05:12.36
You don't want to do that.

127
00:05:12.36 --> 00:05:13.36
Yeah, it makes sense.

128
00:05:13.36 --> 00:05:16.44
And it feels like, you know, it's just how you kind of set it to me.

129
00:05:16.44 --> 00:05:21.52
So that first one, where the tone has a lot to do with it, yeah, how you're legitimate

130
00:05:21.52 --> 00:05:22.52
logical, ultimatum.

131
00:05:22.52 --> 00:05:23.52
Right.

132
00:05:23.52 --> 00:05:26.52
It seemed like it wasn't the first one.

133
00:05:26.52 --> 00:05:28.16
The first one, give me the answer.

134
00:05:28.16 --> 00:05:29.52
I'm out of here, kind of thing.

135
00:05:29.52 --> 00:05:34.76
And then the second, your second example is, it's like, hey, you know, it feels like someone

136
00:05:34.76 --> 00:05:39.000
did that to me either way, up or down.

137
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.20
I feel like it would still maintain the relationship.

138
00:05:42.20 --> 00:05:44.000
Let's say it worked out.

139
00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.08
And it was like, okay, whatever, you got the raise or whatever.

140
00:05:47.08 --> 00:05:51.64
And if you sit in that crazy tone or whatever, like that real fed up tone, yeah, you're

141
00:05:51.64 --> 00:05:53.80
still like, okay, cool, we worked it out.

142
00:05:53.80 --> 00:05:58.52
I got what I want, but like, but we know we've dinged the relationship.

143
00:05:58.52 --> 00:05:59.52
Yeah, it's dinged.

144
00:05:59.52 --> 00:06:01.52
And we don't want to be dinging or relationships.

145
00:06:01.52 --> 00:06:02.92
We want to be building those things.

146
00:06:02.92 --> 00:06:03.92
Yeah.

147
00:06:03.92 --> 00:06:07.60
And I think a lot of times people like, they'll ding the relationship.

148
00:06:07.60 --> 00:06:10.60
And then they'll just move on like nothing, but meanwhile, other persons like, hey,

149
00:06:10.60 --> 00:06:11.60
no.

150
00:06:11.60 --> 00:06:13.96
Don't forget what you said to me and how you said that.

151
00:06:13.96 --> 00:06:17.56
That last week, time heals the wounds, but it doesn't remove the scars.

152
00:06:17.56 --> 00:06:18.56
Yes.

153
00:06:18.56 --> 00:06:22.76
Yeah, I feel like, yeah, I feel like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

154
00:06:22.76 --> 00:06:27.24
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

155
00:06:27.24 --> 00:06:28.24
Next question.

156
00:06:28.24 --> 00:06:29.24
Next question.

157
00:06:29.24 --> 00:06:31.72
Graduated high school, crushed it, straight is.

158
00:06:31.72 --> 00:06:32.72
Boom.

159
00:06:32.72 --> 00:06:37.08
Help my classmates was kind of kind and helpful and expected them to be.

160
00:06:37.08 --> 00:06:41.000
Meanwhile, they put me down, mocked me, never loved me.

161
00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.72
In a room with 30 people, I was always alone.

162
00:06:43.72 --> 00:06:46.44
Intervoiced tells me to go after the past.

163
00:06:46.44 --> 00:06:49.40
Secret revenge, keep looking at their profiles.

164
00:06:49.40 --> 00:06:50.60
Profiles, a online profile.

165
00:06:50.60 --> 00:06:51.60
Yeah, social media.

166
00:06:51.60 --> 00:06:52.84
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

167
00:06:52.84 --> 00:06:54.12
Should I go?

168
00:06:54.12 --> 00:06:56.000
Now, he's got a series of questions here.

169
00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:02.68
Yeah, should I go after them and try to fix the past, either by revenge or else?

170
00:07:02.68 --> 00:07:08.36
Should I, should I remove them from social media and leave the, the Facebook group?

171
00:07:08.36 --> 00:07:10.12
Should I attend the reunion?

172
00:07:10.12 --> 00:07:12.16
Why have they even been in my life?

173
00:07:12.16 --> 00:07:15.08
Okay, so let's break those down.

174
00:07:15.08 --> 00:07:22.32
Number one, should I go after them and try to fix the past, either by revenge or

175
00:07:22.32 --> 00:07:23.32
something else?

176
00:07:23.32 --> 00:07:29.68
They answer that in my opinion, is no man who cares their high school kids move on,

177
00:07:29.68 --> 00:07:31.64
get on with your life.

178
00:07:31.64 --> 00:07:33.48
disagree agree agree.

179
00:07:33.48 --> 00:07:35.88
Okay, that one to me is pretty straightforward.

180
00:07:35.88 --> 00:07:38.44
Don't worry about these humans.

181
00:07:38.44 --> 00:07:43.88
I actually had a couple conversations with my oldest daughters.

182
00:07:43.88 --> 00:07:47.48
Haven't had this one with my son yet, but my older daughters, which is, hey, look, these

183
00:07:47.48 --> 00:07:49.88
people that are around right now that you think are so important.

184
00:07:49.88 --> 00:07:51.32
Hey, nice school.

185
00:07:51.32 --> 00:07:56.000
They're not, you know, some of them might be, might have some lifelong friends from high

186
00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.000
school.

187
00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.04
I get that, but these people that are not nice to you, you won't be thinking about them.

188
00:08:01.04 --> 00:08:05.60
So I don't, I'm not sure how old this individual is, but he's got a couple more years

189
00:08:05.60 --> 00:08:07.60
before he won't be thinking about these people anymore.

190
00:08:07.60 --> 00:08:09.84
So just get there earlier.

191
00:08:09.84 --> 00:08:14.20
Question two, should I remove them from social media and leave this Facebook group?

192
00:08:14.20 --> 00:08:18.12
Okay, this is a little bit tricky in my opinion.

193
00:08:18.12 --> 00:08:23.92
First of all, if you can stay, if you can keep them on social media, but ignore them

194
00:08:23.92 --> 00:08:25.52
completely, just leave them alone.

195
00:08:25.52 --> 00:08:28.56
Just leave it into totally ignore them.

196
00:08:28.56 --> 00:08:34.20
Because when you leave them or whatever, you're kind of, aren't you kind of making

197
00:08:34.20 --> 00:08:35.20
this scene?

198
00:08:35.20 --> 00:08:36.20
Yes.

199
00:08:36.20 --> 00:08:37.20
Okay, I just want to make sure.

200
00:08:37.20 --> 00:08:39.44
Okay, well yeah, like when you unfriend no more than whatever.

201
00:08:39.44 --> 00:08:41.44
Which didn't you and I have some situations with you?

202
00:08:41.44 --> 00:08:42.44
Yes, we did.

203
00:08:42.44 --> 00:08:44.44
Yeah, actually.

204
00:08:44.44 --> 00:08:50.64
Okay, so I know that I, why, why, who unfriend did you?

205
00:08:50.64 --> 00:08:51.64
My wife.

206
00:08:51.64 --> 00:08:52.64
Yep.

207
00:08:52.64 --> 00:08:53.64
Okay, so you did it.

208
00:08:53.64 --> 00:08:55.56
Well, no, no, no, I didn't even know how to do it.

209
00:08:55.56 --> 00:08:56.88
But I, I figured it out.

210
00:08:56.88 --> 00:08:58.16
No, I didn't.

211
00:08:58.16 --> 00:09:04.56
So I didn't ever have social media until two years ago, but all of a sudden I saw Echo, friends

212
00:09:04.56 --> 00:09:05.56
with my wife.

213
00:09:05.56 --> 00:09:06.56
That's it.

214
00:09:06.56 --> 00:09:09.36
We, we, she's like showing me something and she's, and I see Echo.

215
00:09:09.36 --> 00:09:10.36
That's it.

216
00:09:10.36 --> 00:09:14.60
Why are you friends with people that, why are you friends with people that I know?

217
00:09:14.60 --> 00:09:16.20
On, you're a cook on friend on that.

218
00:09:16.20 --> 00:09:17.36
And I didn't even know it was a big deal.

219
00:09:17.36 --> 00:09:20.68
I just thought, you know, hey, that means.

220
00:09:20.68 --> 00:09:24.08
And, and then I didn't realize it was a big deal.

221
00:09:24.08 --> 00:09:25.08
It's a big deal.

222
00:09:25.08 --> 00:09:26.08
I'm a friend.

223
00:09:26.08 --> 00:09:27.08
Yeah, unfriend.

224
00:09:27.08 --> 00:09:32.76
I thought you did it purposefully knowing it's a big deal, but not understanding that.

225
00:09:32.76 --> 00:09:36.84
It's even a bigger deal than, you know, like, I mean, unfriend, I'm as a joke.

226
00:09:36.84 --> 00:09:39.24
That was like, it was totally your personality at that time.

227
00:09:39.24 --> 00:09:40.40
Oh, you thought I did that to you?

228
00:09:40.40 --> 00:09:42.000
Yeah, like, as a joke, like, unfriend.

229
00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:47.12
You don't say something to me, like, immediately or was it, did a month go by where

230
00:09:47.12 --> 00:09:48.52
I didn't make a joke about it?

231
00:09:48.52 --> 00:09:49.52
I forget.

232
00:09:49.52 --> 00:09:50.52
I forget.

233
00:09:50.52 --> 00:09:53.08
So, so it is kind of making a scene.

234
00:09:53.08 --> 00:09:59.52
If you, if you unfriend this person or you leave the group, then you're just creating

235
00:09:59.52 --> 00:10:01.28
a little firestorm.

236
00:10:01.28 --> 00:10:06.88
But I will say this, if you can't keep yourself from checking on them, then you might

237
00:10:06.88 --> 00:10:08.24
have to do that.

238
00:10:08.24 --> 00:10:12.48
So try it for a couple of weeks, just say, I'm not looking at them.

239
00:10:12.48 --> 00:10:13.48
Yeah.

240
00:10:13.48 --> 00:10:16.88
Let them go, just leave them.

241
00:10:16.88 --> 00:10:21.44
If you can't do that, then delete them and leave the group or whatever.

242
00:10:21.44 --> 00:10:26.36
So, number three, should I attend the reunion?

243
00:10:26.36 --> 00:10:27.96
My answer to that is negative.

244
00:10:27.96 --> 00:10:32.000
Don't, why would you? these people are negative.

245
00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.88
They bring back negative memories.

246
00:10:35.88 --> 00:10:40.08
They didn't treat you well.

247
00:10:40.08 --> 00:10:42.36
Why would you, you don't need to move on?

248
00:10:42.36 --> 00:10:46.92
Again, keyword, I think, move on.

249
00:10:46.92 --> 00:10:53.28
And then the last question is, why have they even been in my life?

250
00:10:53.28 --> 00:10:57.92
Well, I think just like anything else.

251
00:10:57.92 --> 00:11:01.04
Bad, that happens in life.

252
00:11:01.04 --> 00:11:08.72
The things that are bad that happen in life can either teach you or break you.

253
00:11:08.72 --> 00:11:10.96
And you got to decide what you want them to do.

254
00:11:10.96 --> 00:11:13.76
I vote that you, you allow it to teach you.

255
00:11:13.76 --> 00:11:18.84
I vote that you learn from these people that you learn how to forget about the past, that

256
00:11:18.84 --> 00:11:24.36
you learn how to ignore people that are negative, that you learn to control your vengeful

257
00:11:24.36 --> 00:11:26.24
ideas.

258
00:11:26.24 --> 00:11:29.56
That you learn to move on into the future where you're going to meet better people and

259
00:11:29.56 --> 00:11:31.68
better times you'd be at.

260
00:11:31.68 --> 00:11:33.04
That's what I would recommend.

261
00:11:33.04 --> 00:11:35.92
Don't worry about these people from the past.

262
00:11:35.92 --> 00:11:39.20
They're caught up in this weird world.

263
00:11:39.20 --> 00:11:40.20
High school.

264
00:11:40.20 --> 00:11:41.20
This is high school.

265
00:11:41.20 --> 00:11:43.20
They were caught up in high school world.

266
00:11:43.20 --> 00:11:44.20
Only about high school.

267
00:11:44.20 --> 00:11:46.20
Get into the world.

268
00:11:46.20 --> 00:11:47.20
Yeah.

269
00:11:47.20 --> 00:11:48.20
Right?

270
00:11:48.20 --> 00:11:49.20
Big ten.

271
00:11:49.20 --> 00:11:52.28
I got, I've had one daughter that now graduated from high school.

272
00:11:52.28 --> 00:11:54.28
I got two kids in high school right now.

273
00:11:54.28 --> 00:11:55.76
Drama, there's drama.

274
00:11:55.76 --> 00:11:59.20
Actually, believe it or not, there hasn't been a lot of drama with my kids.

275
00:11:59.20 --> 00:12:00.20
Yeah.

276
00:12:00.20 --> 00:12:01.20
Not a lot of high school drama.

277
00:12:01.20 --> 00:12:03.40
That doesn't surprise me.

278
00:12:03.40 --> 00:12:04.40
But I see it.

279
00:12:04.40 --> 00:12:05.40
It does happen.

280
00:12:05.40 --> 00:12:06.40
Oh, yeah.

281
00:12:06.40 --> 00:12:07.40
And I remember the drama.

282
00:12:07.40 --> 00:12:08.40
I'd say it.

283
00:12:08.40 --> 00:12:09.40
I guess I don't know.

284
00:12:09.40 --> 00:12:12.68
It's been a long time since high school for me personally.

285
00:12:12.68 --> 00:12:14.80
But yeah, man, I think that's life.

286
00:12:14.80 --> 00:12:16.000
You know, high school is drama.

287
00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:17.000
Me too.

288
00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.000
A bunch of kids.

289
00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.000
Not knowing nothing.

290
00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:24.24
Is there more drama in high school than there is in life?

291
00:12:24.24 --> 00:12:28.48
Maybe it's because it stuck together.

292
00:12:28.48 --> 00:12:29.48
Yeah.

293
00:12:29.48 --> 00:12:30.48
Like you.

294
00:12:30.48 --> 00:12:31.48
Like you're stuck.

295
00:12:31.48 --> 00:12:32.48
It depends on your life.

296
00:12:32.48 --> 00:12:35.48
Like if you just consider a typical high school versus my life, yeah, way more in high

297
00:12:35.48 --> 00:12:36.48
schools.

298
00:12:36.48 --> 00:12:37.48
Drama, man.

299
00:12:37.48 --> 00:12:38.48
I mean, you're drama.

300
00:12:38.48 --> 00:12:39.48
That's it.

301
00:12:39.48 --> 00:12:40.48
And you're not in really job.

302
00:12:40.48 --> 00:12:41.48
Really?

303
00:12:41.48 --> 00:12:42.48
Yeah.

304
00:12:42.48 --> 00:12:44.28
They're all high school.

305
00:12:44.28 --> 00:12:45.72
All the way, even this guy, obviously.

306
00:12:45.72 --> 00:12:49.56
You know, so it's going to feel like way more than it is for sure.

307
00:12:49.56 --> 00:12:54.08
But you know, when you, the, the further you go along in life,

308
00:12:54.08 --> 00:12:58.52
the more you realize that this means less, these types of things anyway,

309
00:12:58.52 --> 00:13:01.44
when you consider it, high school is really just for learning.

310
00:13:01.44 --> 00:13:03.40
Sure, you learn like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

311
00:13:03.40 --> 00:13:06.000
So, what things to do, you know what I just thought is,

312
00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:11.72
is what's interesting about this is if you're looking back on high school,

313
00:13:11.72 --> 00:13:14.72
either with fond memories or with negative memories,

314
00:13:14.72 --> 00:13:16.84
you feel way, it's not a great thing.

315
00:13:16.84 --> 00:13:20.92
Because you could be like, on Carico from Napoleon Dynamite.

316
00:13:20.92 --> 00:13:21.92
Right?

317
00:13:21.92 --> 00:13:23.84
Living back his high school football games.

318
00:13:23.84 --> 00:13:24.76
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

319
00:13:24.76 --> 00:13:26.24
And he's wishing he made that pass.

320
00:13:26.24 --> 00:13:27.12
And you know what I mean?

321
00:13:27.12 --> 00:13:28.76
One of the state championship or whatever.

322
00:13:28.76 --> 00:13:29.40
Yeah, you get that.

323
00:13:29.40 --> 00:13:30.24
That's not good.

324
00:13:30.24 --> 00:13:30.96
Right?

325
00:13:30.96 --> 00:13:32.96
That means you're stuck in high school.

326
00:13:32.96 --> 00:13:33.96
You peaked in high school.

327
00:13:33.96 --> 00:13:34.80
Yeah.

328
00:13:34.80 --> 00:13:37.08
If you're looking back at the negative things, same thing.

329
00:13:37.08 --> 00:13:37.92
Yeah, same thing.

330
00:13:37.92 --> 00:13:38.52
Who, who?

331
00:13:38.52 --> 00:13:39.52
No, move forward.

332
00:13:39.52 --> 00:13:40.52
Yeah.

333
00:13:40.52 --> 00:13:43.68
In his defense though, obviously, he just graduated.

334
00:13:43.68 --> 00:13:44.68
That's what he's like.

335
00:13:44.68 --> 00:13:47.60
So, his life really is this really, you know, it's too new.

336
00:13:47.60 --> 00:13:49.68
It's like, you know, someone's doing good stuff.

337
00:13:49.68 --> 00:13:50.68
It's going to happen, brother.

338
00:13:50.68 --> 00:13:51.68
Yeah.

339
00:13:51.68 --> 00:13:54.52
Yeah, probably the social media thing though.

340
00:13:54.52 --> 00:13:55.52
See this.

341
00:13:55.52 --> 00:13:57.88
Because there's little levels of like, unfriending.

342
00:13:57.88 --> 00:13:58.88
What are you?

343
00:13:58.88 --> 00:13:59.88
You can unfollow someone.

344
00:13:59.88 --> 00:14:01.24
I'm assuming this is Facebook.

345
00:14:01.24 --> 00:14:02.24
I don't know.

346
00:14:02.24 --> 00:14:03.76
There's, you know, there's so many.

347
00:14:03.76 --> 00:14:04.88
You could be talking about other stuff.

348
00:14:04.88 --> 00:14:09.80
But on Facebook, you can still remain friend, but just unfollow them.

349
00:14:09.80 --> 00:14:11.52
So you won't get all their stuff.

350
00:14:11.52 --> 00:14:13.12
Do they know that?

351
00:14:13.12 --> 00:14:14.12
I don't think so.

352
00:14:14.12 --> 00:14:15.12
So they're not.

353
00:14:15.12 --> 00:14:18.52
I'm sure many people have unfollowed me and I don't know that.

354
00:14:18.52 --> 00:14:21.44
I've never gotten the alert or whatever.

355
00:14:21.44 --> 00:14:23.000
I would say leave the group fully.

356
00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:24.000
Oh, yeah.

357
00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.000
You're giving me the virus.

358
00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.92
You're advice more than me because I don't understand as much as you do.

359
00:14:28.92 --> 00:14:31.24
I don't understand the Facebook group thing.

360
00:14:31.24 --> 00:14:32.24
Yeah.

361
00:14:32.24 --> 00:14:33.24
I mean, depends on many people.

362
00:14:33.24 --> 00:14:34.60
It seems like we're going to like a scene.

363
00:14:34.60 --> 00:14:35.92
I don't like to make a scene.

364
00:14:35.92 --> 00:14:36.92
Yeah.

365
00:14:36.92 --> 00:14:38.12
So I'd be like, well, no, I'm just going to ignore it.

366
00:14:38.12 --> 00:14:39.80
Yeah, I don't think leaving the group is a scene.

367
00:14:39.80 --> 00:14:42.20
If it is, I mean, obviously, depends on how many people in the group is.

368
00:14:42.20 --> 00:14:44.92
Last people in the group, the more the scene is going to be, or if he's always

369
00:14:44.92 --> 00:14:48.56
posting, if he's the head of the group or something like this, then yeah.

370
00:14:48.56 --> 00:14:54.68
You know, how in the past there was etiquette schools, I went to, I went to etiquette classes

371
00:14:54.68 --> 00:14:56.48
when I went to Oscar Cannon at school.

372
00:14:56.48 --> 00:14:57.48
That's cool.

373
00:14:57.48 --> 00:14:59.08
The floor and they teach you which knife to use.

374
00:14:59.08 --> 00:15:00.08
Yeah.

375
00:15:00.08 --> 00:15:02.68
She's tall that stuff and they teach you things.

376
00:15:02.68 --> 00:15:05.68
For instance, you might not know this.

377
00:15:05.68 --> 00:15:09.76
If you take a bite of food and there's something in that bite of food that you don't

378
00:15:09.76 --> 00:15:17.96
want to eat, a bone, whatever, the way to properly get it out of your mouth is to use

379
00:15:17.96 --> 00:15:20.44
your fork, put it on the fork and put it back down on the plate.

380
00:15:20.44 --> 00:15:22.28
So like, yeah, okay, got you.

381
00:15:22.28 --> 00:15:23.12
They would say the same.

382
00:15:23.12 --> 00:15:24.12
So that's the type of thing.

383
00:15:24.12 --> 00:15:28.12
Yeah, there should be a class.

384
00:15:28.12 --> 00:15:32.72
Or we're going to a point where people are going to need a class on social media etiquette.

385
00:15:32.72 --> 00:15:34.96
Yeah, actually, it's not a bad idea.

386
00:15:34.96 --> 00:15:35.72
You should teach it.

387
00:15:35.72 --> 00:15:36.72
All right.

388
00:15:36.72 --> 00:15:37.72
Let's move on.

389
00:15:37.72 --> 00:15:38.72
Thanks, man.

390
00:15:38.72 --> 00:15:39.72
Yeah.

391
00:15:39.72 --> 00:15:40.72
Yeah, that is cool.

392
00:15:40.72 --> 00:15:41.72
Move on, dude.

393
00:15:41.72 --> 00:15:42.72
Move on, brother.

394
00:15:42.72 --> 00:15:43.72
Yeah.

395
00:15:43.72 --> 00:15:44.72
Move on.

396
00:15:44.72 --> 00:15:45.72
Let's move on from that question.

397
00:15:45.72 --> 00:15:46.72
There it is.

398
00:15:46.72 --> 00:15:51.60
You know, that's like, that's like, you know, that's we focused on social media, but that's

399
00:15:51.60 --> 00:15:53.96
just about everything, right?

400
00:15:53.96 --> 00:15:54.96
Anything that you're caught up in.

401
00:15:54.96 --> 00:15:55.96
Yeah.

402
00:15:55.96 --> 00:15:56.96
Anything that you're caught up in.

403
00:15:56.96 --> 00:15:57.96
That's dragging you down.

404
00:15:57.96 --> 00:15:58.96
Just move on.

405
00:15:58.96 --> 00:15:59.96
Yeah.

406
00:15:59.96 --> 00:16:03.04
Whether it's a girl, whether it's the job you should have had, whether it's the investment

407
00:16:03.04 --> 00:16:07.40
you should have made, whether it's the house you didn't buy that you should have all those

408
00:16:07.40 --> 00:16:08.40
things.

409
00:16:08.40 --> 00:16:09.40
Yeah.

410
00:16:09.40 --> 00:16:10.40
Move on, man.

411
00:16:10.40 --> 00:16:11.40
It's gone.

412
00:16:11.40 --> 00:16:12.40
Move on.

413
00:16:12.40 --> 00:16:13.40
Yeah.

414
00:16:13.40 --> 00:16:16.40
It seems like high school is really common when you know like the old classic story of the

415
00:16:16.40 --> 00:16:20.64
person who got bullied in high school and then go back to the vintage.

416
00:16:20.64 --> 00:16:21.64
Yeah.

417
00:16:21.64 --> 00:16:22.80
You know, like that kind of stuff.

418
00:16:22.80 --> 00:16:26.08
But yeah, the more and this is what it feels like to.

419
00:16:26.08 --> 00:16:27.44
I don't know.

420
00:16:27.44 --> 00:16:29.12
I'm not everyone.

421
00:16:29.12 --> 00:16:32.96
But the more you do for yourself after high school.

422
00:16:32.96 --> 00:16:34.52
The last high school is going to mean.

423
00:16:34.52 --> 00:16:37.96
First of all, like this isn't going to any of how they say, well, uncle Rico.

424
00:16:37.96 --> 00:16:40.000
Man, yeah, he, he, you selling top of where.

425
00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:41.000
Yeah.

426
00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:42.20
And it wasn't working out good for him.

427
00:16:42.20 --> 00:16:43.20
Yeah.

428
00:16:43.20 --> 00:16:44.20
He high school was still a big deal to.

429
00:16:44.20 --> 00:16:45.20
Yeah.

430
00:16:45.20 --> 00:16:46.20
Yeah.

431
00:16:46.20 --> 00:16:49.28
Like they always talk about high school football or what they're just.

432
00:16:49.28 --> 00:16:50.76
And there's guys like that for sure.

433
00:16:50.76 --> 00:16:53.76
Um, then you can, it's kind of an indicator.

434
00:16:53.76 --> 00:16:54.76
You know that.

435
00:16:54.76 --> 00:16:59.80
Oh, you know, you might not be doing much now, you know, especially if they're like 40 years

436
00:16:59.80 --> 00:17:00.80
and like that.

437
00:17:00.80 --> 00:17:01.80
Check.

438
00:17:01.80 --> 00:17:02.80
All right.

439
00:17:02.80 --> 00:17:03.80
Next wish.

440
00:17:03.80 --> 00:17:07.56
I'm thinking about starting due to in my MMA gym.

441
00:17:07.56 --> 00:17:09.36
But the instructor is a brown belt.

442
00:17:09.36 --> 00:17:13.16
Should I go train with him or look for a black belt?

443
00:17:13.16 --> 00:17:16.08
Well, if you're out of MMA gym, they have

444
00:17:16.08 --> 00:17:17.08
a brown belt.

445
00:17:17.08 --> 00:17:18.08
That's awesome.

446
00:17:18.08 --> 00:17:19.08
I turn with a brown belt.

447
00:17:19.08 --> 00:17:20.24
I think he's probably really good.

448
00:17:20.24 --> 00:17:25.20
I think it's probably fight oriented because it's in a fight to fight gym, which is good

449
00:17:25.20 --> 00:17:27.32
in my opinion.

450
00:17:27.32 --> 00:17:32.000
And you know, though, the fact of the matter is, and we've said this before, brown belt,

451
00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.28
purple belt, black belt.

452
00:17:34.28 --> 00:17:36.40
There's good teachers in all those.

453
00:17:36.40 --> 00:17:40.44
Blue belt, you know, borderline, really.

454
00:17:40.44 --> 00:17:44.32
You can learn some good fundamentals from our solid blue belt, though.

455
00:17:44.32 --> 00:17:50.76
But also there's some black belts that are not good teachers.

456
00:17:50.76 --> 00:17:53.76
And there's some purple belts that are phenomenal teachers.

457
00:17:53.76 --> 00:17:55.84
So yeah, go train.

458
00:17:55.84 --> 00:17:56.84
Yeah.

459
00:17:56.84 --> 00:17:58.64
I think that's pretty simple question.

460
00:17:58.64 --> 00:17:59.64
Yep.

461
00:17:59.64 --> 00:18:05.64
Yeah, the, you know, how you just said, like some purple belts are great, teach

462
00:18:05.64 --> 00:18:11.20
to the, so the belt usually, for the most part, just indicates the, the, the vast, like

463
00:18:11.20 --> 00:18:12.56
the knowledge, you know.

464
00:18:12.56 --> 00:18:14.64
So it's given that they're a good teacher.

465
00:18:14.64 --> 00:18:17.000
So yeah, if it's a brown belt shoot, that's a lot of knowledge.

466
00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.24
And just given that he's all right, more better.

467
00:18:19.24 --> 00:18:21.72
Teacher, that's going to be legit.

468
00:18:21.72 --> 00:18:23.60
And there is actually blue belt as well.

469
00:18:23.60 --> 00:18:25.28
Yeah, I shouldn't even say that.

470
00:18:25.28 --> 00:18:27.32
There's some blue belt set are really good teachers.

471
00:18:27.32 --> 00:18:28.32
Yeah.

472
00:18:28.32 --> 00:18:32.32
Although it does, you know, you get a purple belt teacher versus a blue belt teacher,

473
00:18:32.32 --> 00:18:33.80
and they're good teachers.

474
00:18:33.80 --> 00:18:36.72
Both of them, of course, you're going to want the, because he's going to have more knowledge

475
00:18:36.72 --> 00:18:37.72
than purple belt.

476
00:18:37.72 --> 00:18:38.72
So you know, blue belt.

477
00:18:38.72 --> 00:18:39.72
And most cases.

478
00:18:39.72 --> 00:18:40.72
Yeah, yeah.

479
00:18:40.72 --> 00:18:41.72
It is.

480
00:18:41.72 --> 00:18:42.72
Yeah.

481
00:18:42.72 --> 00:18:46.08
But if you're just starting, you can, pray, you're just going to be like a sponge.

482
00:18:46.08 --> 00:18:47.08
Yeah.

483
00:18:47.08 --> 00:18:49.64
If someone doesn't even know what, you know what's interesting, you could probably

484
00:18:49.64 --> 00:18:54.40
barely tell if you're a white belt, and you roll with a purple belt in the black

485
00:18:54.40 --> 00:18:55.96
belt, you wouldn't go to tell the, yes.

486
00:18:55.96 --> 00:18:58.36
You, all you know is you got your ass.

487
00:18:58.36 --> 00:18:59.36
What?

488
00:18:59.36 --> 00:19:00.36
Yeah.

489
00:19:00.36 --> 00:19:01.36
That's what you know.

490
00:19:01.36 --> 00:19:02.36
Yeah.

491
00:19:02.36 --> 00:19:03.36
That's all you know.

492
00:19:03.36 --> 00:19:04.48
You don't know how easy it was for them, because it's the same level for both, neither

493
00:19:04.48 --> 00:19:06.36
one of those people's trying hard against a white belt.

494
00:19:06.36 --> 00:19:07.36
Yeah.

495
00:19:07.36 --> 00:19:08.36
And yeah.

496
00:19:08.36 --> 00:19:10.84
And if they know how to teach, like I said, he's a instructor.

497
00:19:10.84 --> 00:19:11.84
He's the instructor.

498
00:19:11.84 --> 00:19:12.84
Yeah.

499
00:19:12.84 --> 00:19:13.84
He's going to be fine.

500
00:19:13.84 --> 00:19:15.24
In fact, that's way more common than you think.

501
00:19:15.24 --> 00:19:16.84
I mean, we're in San Diego.

502
00:19:16.84 --> 00:19:17.84
Yeah.

503
00:19:17.84 --> 00:19:18.84
Even in San Diego though.

504
00:19:18.84 --> 00:19:20.52
There's a brown belt instructors for sure.

505
00:19:20.52 --> 00:19:21.52
Yeah.

506
00:19:21.52 --> 00:19:22.52
And they're good too.

507
00:19:22.52 --> 00:19:23.52
Yeah.

508
00:19:23.52 --> 00:19:24.52
And especially if you're just starting, yeah, man.

509
00:19:24.52 --> 00:19:25.52
Good.

510
00:19:25.52 --> 00:19:26.52
Do that.

511
00:19:26.52 --> 00:19:29.56
And yeah, just like I said, though, sometimes the black belt instructor, he'll be

512
00:19:29.56 --> 00:19:30.56
good at rolling.

513
00:19:30.56 --> 00:19:33.52
He'll be good at Jiu-Jitsu and he can win tournaments, but he can't really instruct that

514
00:19:33.52 --> 00:19:39.80
good or they, or you get like situations where, I mean, I wouldn't say it's super common,

515
00:19:39.80 --> 00:19:40.80
but it's there.

516
00:19:40.80 --> 00:19:45.28
For sure, is, you know, you're really the expression, cross the knowledge, right?

517
00:19:45.28 --> 00:19:48.44
It's like you've been a black belt for so long or anything, right?

518
00:19:48.44 --> 00:19:51.80
Just so good at something that you forget what it's like to be a beginner.

519
00:19:51.80 --> 00:19:56.28
So you kind of, you know, you might skip over some details that are kind of critical

520
00:19:56.28 --> 00:19:57.28
if you're a beginner.

521
00:19:57.28 --> 00:20:01.08
You know, you just kind of, you're subconscious, just assumes that this person knows

522
00:20:01.08 --> 00:20:02.08
a certain amount of things, you know?

523
00:20:02.08 --> 00:20:03.68
Kind of, you can get that.

524
00:20:03.68 --> 00:20:06.72
Like that's, I think, a lot of times with Jams up at the really advanced.

525
00:20:06.72 --> 00:20:14.000
Dean's watching Andy and Noah Raw, we were doing some rounds with Andy and Noah

526
00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:23.20
tucked his foot underneath the far arm on an arm walk from a cross side like a regular

527
00:20:23.20 --> 00:20:26.92
arm walk and Noah's tucking his foot under there.

528
00:20:26.92 --> 00:20:30.80
And Dean says, Dean's, you know, hey, that's a really good detail to who taught you that.

529
00:20:30.80 --> 00:20:33.08
You know, I was like, I taught him.

530
00:20:33.08 --> 00:20:37.72
And he was like, I taught him and know what that's something that Dean taught me.

531
00:20:37.72 --> 00:20:40.84
And I don't know who taught Noah, but it's just, that's the type of detail that you're

532
00:20:40.84 --> 00:20:43.84
talking about where that is a small thing.

533
00:20:43.84 --> 00:20:45.000
You got to be in Jiu-Jitsu for what?

534
00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:48.28
You got to get a lot of other things right before someone says, hey, when you're

535
00:20:48.28 --> 00:20:53.28
on walking someone on the far side, put your, put your, who's basically underneath their

536
00:20:53.28 --> 00:20:56.44
arm to secure their shoulder a little bit better.

537
00:20:56.44 --> 00:20:57.44
Yeah.

538
00:20:57.44 --> 00:20:58.44
That's deep.

539
00:20:58.44 --> 00:21:00.24
So there's those kind of details.

540
00:21:00.24 --> 00:21:05.56
There's another thing where I had a, a finish for Dean or Dean was teaching me an arm walk

541
00:21:05.56 --> 00:21:09.56
finish and I would try it and I was trying it and I would try it and I would try it and

542
00:21:09.56 --> 00:21:11.04
it would never work.

543
00:21:11.04 --> 00:21:15.76
I tried it on him 50 times and finally one day he says, hey, when you do that move,

544
00:21:15.76 --> 00:21:17.44
put the pressure here and set it here.

545
00:21:17.44 --> 00:21:19.48
The next time I did it to him work.

546
00:21:19.48 --> 00:21:20.48
Yeah.

547
00:21:20.48 --> 00:21:21.48
You know what I mean?

548
00:21:21.48 --> 00:21:22.48
Yeah.

549
00:21:22.48 --> 00:21:23.84
And then one little detail.

550
00:21:23.84 --> 00:21:24.84
Yeah.

551
00:21:24.84 --> 00:21:26.84
It's the same thing happened the other day with Andy.

552
00:21:26.84 --> 00:21:32.40
I was going with Andy and we were doing arm walk escapes and he said, hey, you're putting

553
00:21:32.40 --> 00:21:33.24
your pressure here.

554
00:21:33.24 --> 00:21:34.60
He showed me where I was putting the pressure.

555
00:21:34.60 --> 00:21:35.60
He said, put it here.

556
00:21:35.60 --> 00:21:36.60
I don't know what.

557
00:21:36.60 --> 00:21:40.000
The next time I did it to him, he's like, that hurts so bad.

558
00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:41.000
Yeah.

559
00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:42.000
So it's weird.

560
00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:49.52
It's a little details that again, the better the instructor is, the, the more details

561
00:21:49.52 --> 00:21:55.52
you're going to get and most, well, what's important about this is until you are get to a

562
00:21:55.52 --> 00:21:59.20
certain level, you, those details don't even mean anything to you.

563
00:21:59.20 --> 00:22:00.20
Yeah.

564
00:22:00.20 --> 00:22:04.04
Because you, you can't worry about where you're putting some little detail on an arm walk

565
00:22:04.04 --> 00:22:05.04
when you do how to do the arm walk.

566
00:22:05.04 --> 00:22:06.04
Yeah.

567
00:22:06.04 --> 00:22:07.84
You get to be pretty damn good at the arm walk before you start looking at the little

568
00:22:07.84 --> 00:22:08.84
tiny details.

569
00:22:08.84 --> 00:22:09.84
Yeah.

570
00:22:09.84 --> 00:22:13.48
And then that's like the, that was actually going to be part of the point where you get

571
00:22:13.48 --> 00:22:20.16
a black belt super advanced level instructor, but he's not necessarily that good at being

572
00:22:20.16 --> 00:22:21.16
a teacher.

573
00:22:21.16 --> 00:22:25.20
He'll start teaching those details and on stuff and focusing in a ways, whoa, you just skipped

574
00:22:25.20 --> 00:22:28.64
over the part to teach them how to do the actual arm walk.

575
00:22:28.64 --> 00:22:33.68
But he's like, kind of subconsciously, they'll be like, he'll, the course of knowledge says

576
00:22:33.68 --> 00:22:36.32
that it's kind of just assumed.

577
00:22:36.32 --> 00:22:37.68
This is good for the judge.

578
00:22:37.68 --> 00:22:39.80
It's you journey.

579
00:22:39.80 --> 00:22:44.12
I used to say this when I'm teaching you a judiciary move.

580
00:22:44.12 --> 00:22:49.76
Let's say there's 10 things that you have to do to make the judiciary move work.

581
00:22:49.76 --> 00:22:53.20
I can teach you five of them.

582
00:22:53.20 --> 00:22:55.60
The other five you have to figure out because it's where you're putting your weight

583
00:22:55.60 --> 00:22:57.44
and it's where you're putting your balance.

584
00:22:57.44 --> 00:23:01.16
Dean might be able to teach you seven.

585
00:23:01.16 --> 00:23:05.40
Maybe if you take a different class and he will teach you an eight one.

586
00:23:05.40 --> 00:23:11.12
But there's things that you have to figure out on your own on top of the things that

587
00:23:11.12 --> 00:23:12.12
you can be shown.

588
00:23:12.12 --> 00:23:13.12
Yeah.

589
00:23:13.12 --> 00:23:14.36
That's where you got to roll.

590
00:23:14.36 --> 00:23:15.36
Yeah.

591
00:23:15.36 --> 00:23:16.36
Big time.

592
00:23:16.36 --> 00:23:17.36
You got to roll.

593
00:23:17.36 --> 00:23:21.000
Because that's the only way you figure out if it actually works or not and what little adjustment

594
00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:22.000
you have to make.

595
00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:23.000
Yeah.

596
00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:24.000
Yeah.

597
00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:25.000
Fully.

598
00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:27.000
Especially if you have a good instructor they can see it too.

599
00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:30.52
You know like you you know when you drill something or when you're doing the technique

600
00:23:30.52 --> 00:23:33.52
just with your partner and stuff you're like okay yeah good that's good technique and

601
00:23:33.52 --> 00:23:36.84
then when you're moving and trying to defend or whatever it's like I don't know what

602
00:23:36.84 --> 00:23:37.84
I'm doing wrong.

603
00:23:37.84 --> 00:23:38.84
It's not working.

604
00:23:38.84 --> 00:23:42.20
And really obviously it's the answer is yeah because he's not letting you do it but

605
00:23:42.20 --> 00:23:45.92
you know someone like an instructor can look and see like oh look you're letting him do

606
00:23:45.92 --> 00:23:48.48
this or whatever you're forgetting to do this.

607
00:23:48.48 --> 00:23:49.48
Yeah.

608
00:23:49.48 --> 00:23:53.52
I agree with you go train with the brown belt guy.

609
00:23:53.52 --> 00:23:54.52
Yeah.

610
00:23:54.52 --> 00:23:55.52
Go train.

611
00:23:55.52 --> 00:23:56.52
Yeah.

612
00:23:56.52 --> 00:23:59.20
But if you're not learning nothing then you can make that evaluation but the fact that it's

613
00:23:59.20 --> 00:24:00.20
a brown belt.

614
00:24:00.20 --> 00:24:01.20
Yeah we learn a ton.

615
00:24:01.20 --> 00:24:03.20
You'd be learning a ton given that.

616
00:24:03.20 --> 00:24:04.20
For sure.

617
00:24:04.20 --> 00:24:05.84
Next question.

618
00:24:05.84 --> 00:24:11.44
You talk about playing the game quote unquote to win but what about people that play

619
00:24:11.44 --> 00:24:15.84
the game to win for themselves and how do I defeat them?

620
00:24:15.84 --> 00:24:19.44
That's a good good question and it hit me.

621
00:24:19.44 --> 00:24:20.44
Yeah.

622
00:24:20.44 --> 00:24:24.32
When I saw that question I was oh that's a good point and that's a good there's a very

623
00:24:24.32 --> 00:24:27.32
important distinction there because I'm always saying play the game.

624
00:24:27.32 --> 00:24:28.32
Yeah.

625
00:24:28.32 --> 00:24:30.48
You got to play the game.

626
00:24:30.48 --> 00:24:33.32
You got to build the relationships with the boss.

627
00:24:33.32 --> 00:24:35.36
You got to learn what they like and you got to tow the party line.

628
00:24:35.36 --> 00:24:36.36
You got to do the little things.

629
00:24:36.36 --> 00:24:42.000
You got to support the corporate headquarters or the boss or the man.

630
00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:47.08
Right or whatever entity is up in that ivory tower.

631
00:24:47.08 --> 00:24:50.96
I want you to play the game.

632
00:24:50.96 --> 00:24:57.56
Get them on your side and the reason I say to do those things is that's so you can get

633
00:24:57.56 --> 00:25:02.68
more control so that people ask your opinion so that you get listened to.

634
00:25:02.68 --> 00:25:08.60
So that perhaps you get promoted which is good.

635
00:25:08.60 --> 00:25:16.24
But the reason you're doing all those things the reason that you're playing the game

636
00:25:16.24 --> 00:25:20.04
is to help your team accomplish the mission.

637
00:25:20.04 --> 00:25:21.84
That's what you are trying to do.

638
00:25:21.84 --> 00:25:26.84
It's to help your team accomplish the mission.

639
00:25:26.84 --> 00:25:31.72
Now the other side of that is what this question is about.

640
00:25:31.72 --> 00:25:38.000
People that are playing the game for personal gain.

641
00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:44.000
They play the games that they can get listened to so they can drive their personal agenda.

642
00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:48.64
So they can get promoted and they want to get promoted so that they can abuse their

643
00:25:48.64 --> 00:25:50.12
power.

644
00:25:50.12 --> 00:25:54.40
Maybe that abuse of power is just working less.

645
00:25:54.40 --> 00:25:57.08
Maybe it's making other people do the crap jobs.

646
00:25:57.08 --> 00:26:00.48
Whatever the case may be, they've got an agenda and they're going to try and get promoted.

647
00:26:00.48 --> 00:26:03.60
They can take care of themselves.

648
00:26:03.60 --> 00:26:07.20
And that is not why I tell you to play the game.

649
00:26:07.20 --> 00:26:09.08
That's not why I play the game.

650
00:26:09.08 --> 00:26:11.28
I definitely play the game and I played the win.

651
00:26:11.28 --> 00:26:18.64
But I played because I wanted my squad or my platoon or my task unit or my training command

652
00:26:18.64 --> 00:26:21.96
to be able to better accomplish our mission.

653
00:26:21.96 --> 00:26:24.52
That's why I played the game.

654
00:26:24.52 --> 00:26:32.92
Now there is a secondary benefit of playing the game and that is that you could possibly

655
00:26:32.92 --> 00:26:34.08
get promoted earlier.

656
00:26:34.08 --> 00:26:38.84
You could get praise from the boss that looks good on your record and all those things

657
00:26:38.84 --> 00:26:40.96
can happen when you're playing the game.

658
00:26:40.96 --> 00:26:45.52
But that's just like collateral sort of fringe benefits.

659
00:26:45.52 --> 00:26:47.32
But that's not why you're playing the game.

660
00:26:47.32 --> 00:26:53.84
You play the game to help the team win and when the team wins you win.

661
00:26:53.84 --> 00:26:55.84
Which also makes the team win again.

662
00:26:55.84 --> 00:26:59.16
So it's like a positive cycle because you start developing a good reputation and you get

663
00:26:59.16 --> 00:27:00.72
more leeway from the boss than more leeway.

664
00:27:00.72 --> 00:27:03.92
You get from the boss, the more you have the ability to make maneuvers on the battlefield,

665
00:27:03.92 --> 00:27:07.60
the more you can maneuver on the battlefield, the more offensive you can be the more

666
00:27:07.60 --> 00:27:08.60
offensive you can be the more you win.

667
00:27:08.60 --> 00:27:12.48
You get more ability to move more because your boss is giving you even more room to maneuver.

668
00:27:12.48 --> 00:27:13.48
So it's a cycle.

669
00:27:13.48 --> 00:27:17.56
It's a good positive cycle.

670
00:27:17.56 --> 00:27:23.04
Now when you have someone that's on the team that's playing the game for themselves,

671
00:27:23.04 --> 00:27:25.84
first of all, no one likes that person.

672
00:27:25.84 --> 00:27:28.12
Everyone can see that person.

673
00:27:28.12 --> 00:27:30.60
No one likes them and they believe me the military.

674
00:27:30.60 --> 00:27:35.36
The military has unbelievable people that play the game for the best possible reasons to

675
00:27:35.36 --> 00:27:39.16
help that button and help the mission and help succeed.

676
00:27:39.16 --> 00:27:45.52
There's also plenty of people in the military and in every different line of work.

677
00:27:45.52 --> 00:27:50.12
There's plenty of people that play the game because they want to look it out for themselves.

678
00:27:50.12 --> 00:27:51.76
Look it out for number one.

679
00:27:51.76 --> 00:27:52.76
Isn't that the expression?

680
00:27:52.76 --> 00:27:54.80
They're looking out for number one.

681
00:27:54.80 --> 00:28:00.68
There's plenty of people and I dealt with people like that all the time.

682
00:28:00.68 --> 00:28:03.12
And what did I do?

683
00:28:03.12 --> 00:28:07.44
I used to advantage and I'll tell you what, I would get in their head.

684
00:28:07.44 --> 00:28:13.76
And what I would do is I would make them think that the best way for them to win for

685
00:28:13.76 --> 00:28:16.68
themselves personally was for the team to win.

686
00:28:16.68 --> 00:28:19.52
I would get that into their head because a lot of times they missed that point.

687
00:28:19.52 --> 00:28:20.52
They're looking out for themselves.

688
00:28:20.52 --> 00:28:24.64
They're not worried about the team and I would get them thinking that they're going

689
00:28:24.64 --> 00:28:26.32
to look the best if the team wins.

690
00:28:26.32 --> 00:28:31.20
Hey, if you really want to look good, the best way you can get promoters if we look good.

691
00:28:31.20 --> 00:28:32.92
You know, if the team does great.

692
00:28:32.92 --> 00:28:36.56
If you get us the gear we want, the equipment we want, they're training that we need,

693
00:28:36.56 --> 00:28:39.12
that's the best way you're going to look awesome because we're going to succeed more

694
00:28:39.12 --> 00:28:40.68
and that's going to make you look good.

695
00:28:40.68 --> 00:28:44.32
And I'm of course I'm going to be more tactful than I'm not saying it like that.

696
00:28:44.32 --> 00:28:45.32
But I'm saying it.

697
00:28:45.32 --> 00:28:48.64
Getting a little bit of a word of getting them, getting the messaging is there.

698
00:28:48.64 --> 00:28:53.16
I'm going to be saying things, hey, our boss doesn't like our boss doesn't like leaders

699
00:28:53.16 --> 00:28:54.16
that complain.

700
00:28:54.16 --> 00:28:55.16
Right.

701
00:28:55.16 --> 00:28:57.56
You know, I could tell the boss he doesn't like complainers.

702
00:28:57.56 --> 00:28:58.56
You know what I mean?

703
00:28:58.56 --> 00:29:00.56
Little things like that, right?

704
00:29:00.56 --> 00:29:03.44
Hey, the boss likes to hear the truth about stuff.

705
00:29:03.44 --> 00:29:04.44
He wants to know, you know what I mean?

706
00:29:04.44 --> 00:29:08.32
Little things like that.

707
00:29:08.32 --> 00:29:15.08
And you know, here's the thing, that person, that person might get the promotion.

708
00:29:15.08 --> 00:29:19.16
Because what you've done is you've helped them act correctly actually.

709
00:29:19.16 --> 00:29:23.20
And there's a chance, a decent chance, a good chance even, that they carry that forward.

710
00:29:23.20 --> 00:29:27.32
They realize that, hey, the best way to play the game is to help the team.

711
00:29:27.32 --> 00:29:30.84
And the best way to look good is to help that is to make the team good and succeed at

712
00:29:30.84 --> 00:29:34.72
the mission.

713
00:29:34.72 --> 00:29:41.000
And it's really, you know, one of the classic cases, then we'll get into ownership a little

714
00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:42.000
bit.

715
00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:45.44
But if something goes wrong, right, the person that's looking out for themselves blames

716
00:29:45.44 --> 00:29:48.000
everyone else.

717
00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:50.20
And so that's a challenge, right?

718
00:29:50.20 --> 00:29:52.92
Because once you start blaming, once that boss starts blaming everyone, then the whole

719
00:29:52.92 --> 00:29:55.08
team starts blaming each other.

720
00:29:55.08 --> 00:29:57.000
So how do you fix that?

721
00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:59.000
Well, it's, we've talked about it a million times.

722
00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:02.28
You know, you step up and say, hey, you know what boss is my fault?

723
00:30:02.28 --> 00:30:05.60
And boss, because that's right, it's your fault.

724
00:30:05.60 --> 00:30:14.68
And there's a, there's a good chance that they recognize how positive that is.

725
00:30:14.68 --> 00:30:15.68
And it may take a while.

726
00:30:15.68 --> 00:30:19.12
And it may never happen because some people are just savages, right?

727
00:30:19.12 --> 00:30:20.68
Some people are just complete.

728
00:30:20.68 --> 00:30:23.20
They only care about themselves.

729
00:30:23.20 --> 00:30:27.60
They only care about the next promotion and getting the next award and getting the next

730
00:30:27.60 --> 00:30:28.60
bit of recognition.

731
00:30:28.60 --> 00:30:30.60
There's people like that.

732
00:30:30.60 --> 00:30:32.60
They're, they're horrible.

733
00:30:32.60 --> 00:30:34.24
They're horrible.

734
00:30:34.24 --> 00:30:35.24
They exist.

735
00:30:35.24 --> 00:30:36.44
But they're pretty small.

736
00:30:36.44 --> 00:30:41.12
Most people, if they see, hey, this, this is working for this guy.

737
00:30:41.12 --> 00:30:45.24
It can work for me too, and that starts to spread.

738
00:30:45.24 --> 00:30:50.60
And the other thing that happens, I think, is if someone's just a flagrant self-promoter,

739
00:30:50.60 --> 00:30:58.36
you might get them one promotion because you were there to kind of make them look good.

740
00:30:58.36 --> 00:31:00.08
But the next time around, they're going to get seen.

741
00:31:00.08 --> 00:31:01.32
They're going to get found out.

742
00:31:01.32 --> 00:31:04.84
They're going to people are going to realize what kind of person they are.

743
00:31:04.84 --> 00:31:10.76
And that's where it catches up with them.

744
00:31:10.76 --> 00:31:13.20
So you keep playing the game.

745
00:31:13.20 --> 00:31:15.80
You keep, you keep working hard.

746
00:31:15.80 --> 00:31:16.80
Don't worry about them.

747
00:31:16.80 --> 00:31:18.60
And actually do your best to help them out.

748
00:31:18.60 --> 00:31:20.12
The person that's like self-promoting.

749
00:31:20.12 --> 00:31:21.12
You're the best to help them out.

750
00:31:21.12 --> 00:31:22.72
If they're the boss, make them look good.

751
00:31:22.72 --> 00:31:25.40
I always want to make my boss look good.

752
00:31:25.40 --> 00:31:26.40
Yeah.

753
00:31:26.40 --> 00:31:28.04
It's going to help you in the long run.

754
00:31:28.04 --> 00:31:29.04
It's hard sometimes.

755
00:31:29.04 --> 00:31:30.04
Yeah.

756
00:31:30.04 --> 00:31:31.04
It's hard to do sometimes.

757
00:31:31.04 --> 00:31:32.04
Yep.

758
00:31:32.04 --> 00:31:33.32
Are you going to get some of the way sometimes?

759
00:31:33.32 --> 00:31:35.08
Got to put that ego in check?

760
00:31:35.08 --> 00:31:36.72
Because what's more important?

761
00:31:36.72 --> 00:31:40.76
Because if you're my boss, Echo, and you're doing this just to make yourself look good,

762
00:31:40.76 --> 00:31:43.32
if I then undermine you.

763
00:31:43.32 --> 00:31:47.96
Well, and now we don't accomplish the mission as well, I'm actually a bad person because

764
00:31:47.96 --> 00:31:50.08
I didn't do my best to accomplish the mission.

765
00:31:50.08 --> 00:31:51.08
Right?

766
00:31:51.08 --> 00:31:52.08
We didn't look good.

767
00:31:52.08 --> 00:31:54.20
I'm not worried about how we look, but we failed in our mission.

768
00:31:54.20 --> 00:31:56.40
When we didn't do our mission to the best of our ability.

769
00:31:56.40 --> 00:31:58.16
So no, I'm not going to let that happen.

770
00:31:58.16 --> 00:31:59.16
You want to look great?

771
00:31:59.16 --> 00:32:00.16
Cool.

772
00:32:00.16 --> 00:32:02.64
I want to make you look great because I want us to look great new in our mission because

773
00:32:02.64 --> 00:32:04.32
that's what's important to me.

774
00:32:04.32 --> 00:32:09.56
And if some of the collateral damage of that is that you look great even though you're

775
00:32:09.56 --> 00:32:12.32
a jerk and I get you promoted, that's okay.

776
00:32:12.32 --> 00:32:13.92
Because eventually you're going to get found out.

777
00:32:13.92 --> 00:32:18.36
Or you're going to learn to be a better person and to support the team.

778
00:32:18.36 --> 00:32:21.48
And that's how you got promoted near and realize that and you'll become a good leader.

779
00:32:21.48 --> 00:32:22.48
Yeah.

780
00:32:22.48 --> 00:32:23.48
Yeah.

781
00:32:23.48 --> 00:32:26.92
I agree with that one.

782
00:32:26.92 --> 00:32:30.72
Like I always have where people can see that too.

783
00:32:30.72 --> 00:32:31.72
You know what they can see.

784
00:32:31.72 --> 00:32:35.92
You know, like if your boss is like a self promoter or whatever.

785
00:32:35.92 --> 00:32:38.64
And you have it in your head, I understand.

786
00:32:38.64 --> 00:32:43.08
I understand this because I've been in a situation where I'm like shoot, I feel inside

787
00:32:43.08 --> 00:32:47.12
that I don't want to make an effort to make them look good kind of thing because it's

788
00:32:47.12 --> 00:32:50.32
like he doesn't deserve it and the thing.

789
00:32:50.32 --> 00:32:51.32
And what?

790
00:32:51.32 --> 00:32:53.44
Like what I'm going to make him look good and now everyone's going to think that he looks

791
00:32:53.44 --> 00:32:54.44
good kind of thing.

792
00:32:54.44 --> 00:32:56.28
But then when you really think about it, another not.

793
00:32:56.28 --> 00:32:57.28
They see that kind of thing.

794
00:32:57.28 --> 00:32:58.28
They see that kind of thing.

795
00:32:58.28 --> 00:32:59.28
Yeah.

796
00:32:59.28 --> 00:33:00.28
You're right.

797
00:33:00.28 --> 00:33:02.24
And the same goes for you.

798
00:33:02.24 --> 00:33:07.36
Like if you're like, you know, if you're just focusing on the positive stuff, you know,

799
00:33:07.36 --> 00:33:10.24
you know, like you're, you know, what do you just, you know, if you don't have anything nice

800
00:33:10.24 --> 00:33:11.40
to say, don't say it at all.

801
00:33:11.40 --> 00:33:14.44
If you're really doing that, like people notice that too.

802
00:33:14.44 --> 00:33:16.88
They're like, man, that guy's like really positive.

803
00:33:16.88 --> 00:33:19.08
You're really focusing on this, you know, kind of thing.

804
00:33:19.08 --> 00:33:20.08
Like people see it.

805
00:33:20.08 --> 00:33:23.36
And this doesn't mean you're just Mr. Positive, show good coat and everything.

806
00:33:23.36 --> 00:33:26.36
And it's not, it's not what I'm talking about that.

807
00:33:26.36 --> 00:33:32.36
But you are not focusing on the negative instead of saying, oh, we're all about this.

808
00:33:32.36 --> 00:33:33.36
You say, you know what?

809
00:33:33.36 --> 00:33:34.36
We got some deficiency here.

810
00:33:34.36 --> 00:33:35.36
Here's what I'm going to do to fix them.

811
00:33:35.36 --> 00:33:36.36
Yeah.

812
00:33:36.36 --> 00:33:37.36
Yeah.

813
00:33:37.36 --> 00:33:38.36
How simple is that?

814
00:33:38.36 --> 00:33:39.36
Yeah.

815
00:33:39.36 --> 00:33:40.36
Yeah.

816
00:33:40.36 --> 00:33:41.36
And the point is, people, they see.

817
00:33:41.36 --> 00:33:45.80
They see, don't think that, you know, like you're going to help, you know, make this guy look

818
00:33:45.80 --> 00:33:48.40
good and they're just going to, they're going to not see it.

819
00:33:48.40 --> 00:33:50.80
And they're just going to fall for the, he is trick or something.

820
00:33:50.80 --> 00:33:51.80
Ah, they see it.

821
00:33:51.80 --> 00:33:52.80
They see it.

822
00:33:52.80 --> 00:33:53.80
Most of the time.

823
00:33:53.80 --> 00:33:54.80
Most of the time.

824
00:33:54.80 --> 00:34:00.16
That example that you said about playing to there, you, or whatever, where you're like,

825
00:34:00.16 --> 00:34:03.40
hey, you know, you know, you, you're going to look really good if you're helping.

826
00:34:03.40 --> 00:34:05.44
So you ever seen the movie Moana?

827
00:34:05.44 --> 00:34:07.72
I saw three minutes of it.

828
00:34:07.72 --> 00:34:11.96
Oh, see that you go, she does, so the guy, the main guy is the, the demigod.

829
00:34:11.96 --> 00:34:12.96
The name is Molly.

830
00:34:12.96 --> 00:34:14.84
And played by the rock, by the way, twin childhood.

831
00:34:14.84 --> 00:34:18.04
Great movie by the way.

832
00:34:18.04 --> 00:34:19.48
She does him like that.

833
00:34:19.48 --> 00:34:23.64
She's like, hey, let's, they got to go do this mission, you know, for restore the heart,

834
00:34:23.64 --> 00:34:25.08
you know, whatever, it's long story.

835
00:34:25.08 --> 00:34:27.32
But, and he's like, you know, whatever, reluctant.

836
00:34:27.32 --> 00:34:30.000
And he's like, she's like, hey, you'll be a hero.

837
00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:31.80
Again, and he's like, I'm all right.

838
00:34:31.80 --> 00:34:32.80
Yeah, hero.

839
00:34:32.80 --> 00:34:33.80
She's like, well, no.

840
00:34:33.80 --> 00:34:36.80
No, for a while, you know, you haven't done anything lately.

841
00:34:36.80 --> 00:34:40.56
But if you do this, and you'll be the hero to everyone.

842
00:34:40.56 --> 00:34:42.64
And yeah, and of course he does it.

843
00:34:42.64 --> 00:34:43.48
Of course, BAM.

844
00:34:43.48 --> 00:34:44.000
It's good.

845
00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:45.000
It's good.

846
00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:46.000
It works.

847
00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:47.72
It is proof on Moana.

848
00:34:49.72 --> 00:34:50.52
Moana.

849
00:34:50.52 --> 00:34:51.04
Next session.

850
00:34:54.80 --> 00:35:00.32
I have to say that in a very competitive environment, extreme ownership can be used

851
00:35:00.32 --> 00:35:05.68
by your enemies or the people that want your position.

852
00:35:05.68 --> 00:35:10.68
When you take ownership over all faults of your team members, you guys become, you

853
00:35:10.68 --> 00:35:13.44
guys become better and get healthier, healthier attitude.

854
00:35:13.44 --> 00:35:14.36
But that takes time.

855
00:35:14.36 --> 00:35:18.96
So until your team improves and start to get better results, your opponents will take

856
00:35:18.96 --> 00:35:25.24
those tens of, it was my fault and present them to your boss as proof that yeah, this

857
00:35:25.24 --> 00:35:29.68
guy is not good or at least not confident enough and looks weak.

858
00:35:29.68 --> 00:35:30.52
It's not my case.

859
00:35:30.52 --> 00:35:37.08
For me, it worked to great, but I've seen it happening to few colleagues who just didn't

860
00:35:37.08 --> 00:35:42.68
have good team members and they took their extreme ownership for weakness and just took

861
00:35:42.68 --> 00:35:43.68
advantage of that.

862
00:35:43.68 --> 00:35:44.68
Okay.

863
00:35:44.68 --> 00:35:48.52
So what we've got here is what he's saying is extreme ownership.

864
00:35:48.52 --> 00:35:52.52
If you're taking extreme ownership of things, your enemies can actually take advantage

865
00:35:52.52 --> 00:35:53.52
of that.

866
00:35:53.52 --> 00:35:55.04
And in this guy's case, right?

867
00:35:55.04 --> 00:35:57.04
Like in the earlier stages of it.

868
00:35:57.04 --> 00:35:58.04
Yeah.

869
00:35:58.04 --> 00:36:00.48
And he said, well, actually, he says that for him, it's worked great.

870
00:36:00.48 --> 00:36:05.16
But that he's seen some of his compoders who have started to take ownership and they're

871
00:36:05.16 --> 00:36:09.40
they've got weak team and the team, what does he say here?

872
00:36:09.40 --> 00:36:11.36
What's the word to use this?

873
00:36:11.36 --> 00:36:15.16
They didn't have good team members and they took their extreme ownership for weakness

874
00:36:15.16 --> 00:36:16.20
and took advantage of it.

875
00:36:16.20 --> 00:36:17.20
Okay.

876
00:36:17.20 --> 00:36:25.68
So first of all, out of the gate, if you have weak or bad team members, that is the first

877
00:36:25.68 --> 00:36:29.12
thing the leader needs to take ownership of.

878
00:36:29.12 --> 00:36:30.12
Right?

879
00:36:30.12 --> 00:36:34.16
If you have truly weak and bad team members, then you need to either train them or

880
00:36:34.16 --> 00:36:37.48
coach them or get rid of them.

881
00:36:37.48 --> 00:36:39.12
That's the first thing.

882
00:36:39.12 --> 00:36:45.96
So if you've got backstabbing bad team members that are looking to claw you down as the

883
00:36:45.96 --> 00:36:49.12
leader, you've got a problem with those people.

884
00:36:49.12 --> 00:36:50.56
Then you need to fix that problem.

885
00:36:50.56 --> 00:36:52.08
Number one.

886
00:36:52.08 --> 00:36:54.76
So let's just start with that.

887
00:36:54.76 --> 00:36:56.36
Number two.

888
00:36:56.36 --> 00:36:59.08
And this is, this is there's two kinds of parts of this.

889
00:36:59.08 --> 00:37:08.20
There's an insecurity, level of insecurity and there's a level of, or a matter of perception.

890
00:37:08.20 --> 00:37:13.28
The insecurity is the thing that says, if I say this is my fault and everyone up and down

891
00:37:13.28 --> 00:37:16.48
the chain, it's going to say fire him.

892
00:37:16.48 --> 00:37:17.48
Fire him.

893
00:37:17.48 --> 00:37:18.68
It's his fault.

894
00:37:18.68 --> 00:37:24.32
But I want you to think about how that's actually perceived.

895
00:37:24.32 --> 00:37:30.08
If what you do is, let's take the other example is what you do is you blame everyone else.

896
00:37:30.08 --> 00:37:33.08
If that's your attitude, if you're attitude is it wasn't my fault, it was his fault.

897
00:37:33.08 --> 00:37:34.08
It was her fault.

898
00:37:34.08 --> 00:37:35.08
It was their fault.

899
00:37:35.08 --> 00:37:36.08
It was not me.

900
00:37:36.08 --> 00:37:37.08
I'm just the person in charge.

901
00:37:37.08 --> 00:37:38.08
It's not me.

902
00:37:38.08 --> 00:37:40.08
It's not my fault.

903
00:37:40.08 --> 00:37:41.72
It's my team's fault.

904
00:37:41.72 --> 00:37:42.96
I'm just the person in charge.

905
00:37:42.96 --> 00:37:43.96
It's not my fault.

906
00:37:43.96 --> 00:37:46.000
Think about that.

907
00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:51.40
Whenever you're placing blame, if you're a leader and you're placing blame on your team,

908
00:37:51.40 --> 00:37:54.000
what you're saying is, hey, it's not my fault.

909
00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:55.000
It's my team's fault.

910
00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:57.36
I'm just the leader here.

911
00:37:57.36 --> 00:37:59.88
I'm not the one out there in the field doing the work.

912
00:37:59.88 --> 00:38:01.68
I'm not the one that's making those decisions.

913
00:38:01.68 --> 00:38:09.32
I'm not the one that's interacting with customers.

914
00:38:09.32 --> 00:38:12.000
I'm not the one that's doing that.

915
00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:13.20
So this isn't my fault.

916
00:38:13.20 --> 00:38:15.64
It's my team's fault.

917
00:38:15.64 --> 00:38:17.88
Well meanwhile, guess who's in charge of the team?

918
00:38:17.88 --> 00:38:19.64
You are.

919
00:38:19.64 --> 00:38:23.28
So the minute that you started saying it wasn't my fault and who's for a lay and everyone

920
00:38:23.28 --> 00:38:28.44
else is fault, that if you think about how you look to your boss, it's laughable.

921
00:38:28.44 --> 00:38:31.44
You look like an idiot.

922
00:38:31.44 --> 00:38:33.16
You don't look like a good leader.

923
00:38:33.16 --> 00:38:35.16
So don't fall for it.

924
00:38:35.16 --> 00:38:36.16
And you know what?

925
00:38:36.16 --> 00:38:39.60
I'm actually not saying that you'll never get fired if you take ownership.

926
00:38:39.60 --> 00:38:41.16
Because you know what?

927
00:38:41.16 --> 00:38:46.88
If you do something that's really bad, there's absolutely a chance you get fired.

928
00:38:46.88 --> 00:38:51.40
If you do something that cost a bunch of money or was immoral or illegal or you covered

929
00:38:51.40 --> 00:38:57.52
something up or your team covered something up or you did something that was truly wrong.

930
00:38:57.52 --> 00:38:58.52
And you take ownership of it.

931
00:38:58.52 --> 00:38:59.52
Yeah, you might still get fired.

932
00:38:59.52 --> 00:39:00.52
You know what?

933
00:39:00.52 --> 00:39:01.52
That happens in the Navy.

934
00:39:01.52 --> 00:39:05.36
In the Navy, if your ship runs around or like lately there's been some collisions

935
00:39:05.36 --> 00:39:06.68
on these ships and all of it.

936
00:39:06.68 --> 00:39:10.76
I think a layman I might talk about those at some point in the podcast.

937
00:39:10.76 --> 00:39:14.20
But the captain of the ship is done.

938
00:39:14.20 --> 00:39:17.92
It doesn't matter if you was on the ship or not.

939
00:39:17.92 --> 00:39:21.36
He could be because just because the ships at sea, the captain might have had to flunk

940
00:39:21.36 --> 00:39:23.88
to another ship to talk to the Admiral.

941
00:39:23.88 --> 00:39:25.60
If his ship crashes, he's done.

942
00:39:25.60 --> 00:39:27.16
It doesn't matter if he's there or not.

943
00:39:27.16 --> 00:39:28.40
He's responsible for the training.

944
00:39:28.40 --> 00:39:29.40
He's responsible for the actions.

945
00:39:29.40 --> 00:39:32.56
He's responsible for everything that's happening on that ship.

946
00:39:32.56 --> 00:39:34.12
And he's getting fired.

947
00:39:34.12 --> 00:39:38.72
And also, if he did do something wrong, yeah, and he takes ownership of it, doesn't

948
00:39:38.72 --> 00:39:39.72
matter.

949
00:39:39.72 --> 00:39:40.72
He's getting fired.

950
00:39:40.72 --> 00:39:42.76
So I'm not saying you're never going to get fired.

951
00:39:42.76 --> 00:39:48.20
But generally, generally, and this is, when I say generally, this is the vast majority of

952
00:39:48.20 --> 00:39:49.44
the time.

953
00:39:49.44 --> 00:39:52.04
This is 99% of the time.

954
00:39:52.04 --> 00:39:54.08
If you take ownership, you don't look like a weak boss.

955
00:39:54.08 --> 00:39:56.68
You look like a strong boss that is taking ownership of the problems that is going

956
00:39:56.68 --> 00:39:57.68
to get the problem solved.

957
00:39:57.68 --> 00:40:01.68
I say this, I'll learn no further again.

958
00:40:01.68 --> 00:40:05.84
And as always, you don't just have to own the problems you have to own the solutions

959
00:40:05.84 --> 00:40:06.64
to the problems too.

960
00:40:06.64 --> 00:40:10.32
So this is the situation here.

961
00:40:10.32 --> 00:40:13.28
You got this guy.

962
00:40:13.28 --> 00:40:18.76
If you're in charge of a bad team, and you're taking ownership, the bad team is what

963
00:40:18.76 --> 00:40:19.76
you have to fix.

964
00:40:19.76 --> 00:40:20.76
You have to fix it.

965
00:40:20.76 --> 00:40:21.76
You have to train them.

966
00:40:21.76 --> 00:40:24.12
You have to coach them.

967
00:40:24.12 --> 00:40:25.12
You have to mentor them.

968
00:40:25.12 --> 00:40:26.36
You have to do all those things.

969
00:40:26.36 --> 00:40:29.28
And if you can't get them to get on board with the program, then you've got to get rid of

970
00:40:29.28 --> 00:40:30.28
them.

971
00:40:30.28 --> 00:40:34.56
Or get rid of that one or two bad people that are causing the infraction and causing that

972
00:40:34.56 --> 00:40:36.28
cancer to spread.

973
00:40:36.28 --> 00:40:37.56
Get rid of them.

974
00:40:37.56 --> 00:40:38.56
Set the example.

975
00:40:38.56 --> 00:40:43.80
Promote somebody that's hungry and young and wants to get after it.

976
00:40:43.80 --> 00:40:50.64
So you've got to take ownership of the team, the problems, the weak people on the team.

977
00:40:50.64 --> 00:40:54.92
You've got to take ownership of the solutions and get them solved.

978
00:40:54.92 --> 00:41:01.72
It seems like, and I kind of noticed this from the beginning, that we need to take.

979
00:41:01.72 --> 00:41:05.56
I was going to cut you off with, I have to talk about this before.

980
00:41:05.56 --> 00:41:09.40
Sometimes people say, they think if they say, I'll take ownership of this, then the

981
00:41:09.40 --> 00:41:11.44
problems, then they're safe.

982
00:41:11.44 --> 00:41:12.44
That's exactly what we're saying.

983
00:41:12.44 --> 00:41:13.44
Yeah.

984
00:41:13.44 --> 00:41:14.44
Yeah.

985
00:41:14.44 --> 00:41:15.44
That is not the case.

986
00:41:15.44 --> 00:41:17.44
Yeah, just because you say, hey, this is my fault.

987
00:41:17.44 --> 00:41:18.44
It's my fault.

988
00:41:18.44 --> 00:41:19.44
I'm taking ownership of this.

989
00:41:19.44 --> 00:41:21.68
That doesn't mean the problem is solved.

990
00:41:21.68 --> 00:41:23.52
There's a problem.

991
00:41:23.52 --> 00:41:25.88
You have to say, yes, there's a problem here.

992
00:41:25.88 --> 00:41:27.28
I'm taking ownership of it.

993
00:41:27.28 --> 00:41:30.80
My fault because I'm in charge and this is what we're going to do to fix it.

994
00:41:30.80 --> 00:41:33.08
And then you have to actually go and fix it.

995
00:41:33.08 --> 00:41:34.08
There's the point.

996
00:41:34.08 --> 00:41:35.08
Right there.

997
00:41:35.08 --> 00:41:36.08
Yeah.

998
00:41:36.08 --> 00:41:42.20
As if you come to me 12 times, you say, hey, Jokeway, we didn't get the podcast out.

999
00:41:42.20 --> 00:41:43.20
Because I forgot to hit record.

1000
00:41:43.20 --> 00:41:44.20
Hey, that's my bust.

1001
00:41:44.20 --> 00:41:45.20
That's my bust.

1002
00:41:45.20 --> 00:41:46.20
Okay.

1003
00:41:46.20 --> 00:41:47.20
Well, the hate from now on here's what we're doing.

1004
00:41:47.20 --> 00:41:49.96
I'm going to make sure that we have this things in place and I hooked up a light

1005
00:41:49.96 --> 00:41:54.64
and it's going to, if the thing isn't recording, the studio is going to go duck.

1006
00:41:54.64 --> 00:41:59.08
I don't know if you remember this because this might be just the way you are.

1007
00:41:59.08 --> 00:42:03.84
But when we went to remember, we went to the where do we go?

1008
00:42:03.84 --> 00:42:04.84
We went last trip.

1009
00:42:04.84 --> 00:42:05.84
We went driving.

1010
00:42:05.84 --> 00:42:07.84
We went to, oh, Charlie Plum.

1011
00:42:07.84 --> 00:42:08.84
Yeah.

1012
00:42:08.84 --> 00:42:09.84
I'm pretty sure it's really close.

1013
00:42:09.84 --> 00:42:15.08
I can't remember what we were looking for either the hotel or the place or whatever.

1014
00:42:15.08 --> 00:42:17.08
Let's stay counts.

1015
00:42:17.08 --> 00:42:20.08
Why did I think that was a good thing.

1016
00:42:20.08 --> 00:42:21.08
So we're going in.

1017
00:42:21.08 --> 00:42:25.76
I was kind of navigating and you were kind of navigating, kind of trying to help.

1018
00:42:25.76 --> 00:42:28.40
Not trying to help, but you were kind of navigating, but kind of not.

1019
00:42:28.40 --> 00:42:33.16
It really seemed like to me anyway, you were like, okay, I'll let you kind of navigate.

1020
00:42:33.16 --> 00:42:38.80
And we took her on, whatever.

1021
00:42:38.80 --> 00:42:41.92
We were off track or whatever.

1022
00:42:41.92 --> 00:42:46.28
I was like, okay, I got to take extreme ownership right now.

1023
00:42:46.28 --> 00:42:50.04
Because right now it's like the perfect time to take extreme ownership.

1024
00:42:50.04 --> 00:42:53.04
Or as should I say, the worst time not to take extreme ownership.

1025
00:42:53.04 --> 00:42:54.64
So I'm like, oh, no, that's my bad.

1026
00:42:54.64 --> 00:42:57.04
I'm going to, you know, let me do this kind of thing.

1027
00:42:57.04 --> 00:43:01.84
But at the same time, you really aggressively took ownership.

1028
00:43:01.84 --> 00:43:04.96
You're almost at the point where at first I was like, are you joking?

1029
00:43:04.96 --> 00:43:05.96
But you weren't joking.

1030
00:43:05.96 --> 00:43:08.32
You were like, take the next turn right here.

1031
00:43:08.32 --> 00:43:09.32
And we'd come close to it.

1032
00:43:09.32 --> 00:43:10.92
You'd be like, this turn right here.

1033
00:43:10.92 --> 00:43:11.92
This turn right here.

1034
00:43:11.92 --> 00:43:13.28
That's a cute, at all point around.

1035
00:43:13.28 --> 00:43:16.48
You were not letting me, you know, make a mistake again.

1036
00:43:16.48 --> 00:43:20.56
But which is funny though, but it is a good example.

1037
00:43:20.56 --> 00:43:26.84
Because not only, I mean, in your mind, you put forward the more important part.

1038
00:43:26.84 --> 00:43:31.80
You were like, okay, I'm going to take, it's like your actions said that it's your fault.

1039
00:43:31.80 --> 00:43:37.76
But the solutions that you had, even though they're really extreme or whatever, like,

1040
00:43:37.76 --> 00:43:39.28
that was the part that you were influenced by.

1041
00:43:39.28 --> 00:43:40.28
Wasn't the jerk about it though?

1042
00:43:40.28 --> 00:43:43.16
No, no, just, okay, all right, you know what, here's the next turn.

1043
00:43:43.16 --> 00:43:45.16
It's going to be a point five miles here.

1044
00:43:45.16 --> 00:43:46.16
It's coming up on the right.

1045
00:43:46.16 --> 00:43:47.16
All right, right, and turn right here.

1046
00:43:47.16 --> 00:43:48.68
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, we know what it is.

1047
00:43:48.68 --> 00:43:51.76
That's how we navigate in the game.

1048
00:43:51.76 --> 00:43:52.76
Oh, for real?

1049
00:43:52.76 --> 00:43:53.76
It's actually good.

1050
00:43:53.76 --> 00:43:56.16
I mean, it's really squared away.

1051
00:43:56.16 --> 00:43:59.80
Yeah, we're in a convoy of military vehicles.

1052
00:43:59.80 --> 00:44:00.80
Yeah, it's awesome.

1053
00:44:00.80 --> 00:44:01.80
And you know, it's bad.

1054
00:44:01.80 --> 00:44:07.32
It's really on my part is that at first I thought you're joking, like patronizing me, you know?

1055
00:44:07.32 --> 00:44:08.32
I'm don't do that.

1056
00:44:08.32 --> 00:44:10.32
But that's really kind of my ego, you know?

1057
00:44:10.32 --> 00:44:15.32
How does it, it's like, duh, you said the next turn, this is the next turn, I can figure

1058
00:44:15.32 --> 00:44:16.32
that out.

1059
00:44:16.32 --> 00:44:18.44
I'm smart enough to figure that out, kind of thing.

1060
00:44:18.44 --> 00:44:22.72
But if I'm like, okay, this is the system, you know, Joc was going to tell me and he's

1061
00:44:22.72 --> 00:44:26.76
going to be detailed about it and make absolutely sure we don't miss the turn, kind of

1062
00:44:26.76 --> 00:44:31.56
think, then you're right, dang, that's a good way to navigate, you know?

1063
00:44:31.56 --> 00:44:33.68
But two people got to be on board.

1064
00:44:33.68 --> 00:44:36.28
But nonetheless, like, dang, you had the solution, you know?

1065
00:44:36.28 --> 00:44:41.04
So goes back to it, like it seems like back to this question, your enemies could take advantage

1066
00:44:41.04 --> 00:44:42.60
early on, right?

1067
00:44:42.60 --> 00:44:46.32
As it's as the extreme ownership cultures trying to take hold to kind of, that's what

1068
00:44:46.32 --> 00:44:48.32
I'm kind of getting from it.

1069
00:44:48.32 --> 00:44:52.04
Like even early on, that's what I think even early on.

1070
00:44:52.04 --> 00:44:53.04
Like, okay, this is the default.

1071
00:44:53.04 --> 00:44:54.04
Yeah, you're so happy.

1072
00:44:54.04 --> 00:44:55.04
Yeah, you're so happy.

1073
00:44:55.04 --> 00:44:57.68
Even early on, you don't look like an idiot.

1074
00:44:57.68 --> 00:45:01.56
You actually look square away because you go here off the problems that we're having,

1075
00:45:01.56 --> 00:45:02.88
that I've identified.

1076
00:45:02.88 --> 00:45:04.52
Here's what we're going to do to fix them.

1077
00:45:04.52 --> 00:45:05.52
Yeah.

1078
00:45:05.52 --> 00:45:07.32
Those were driving right now.

1079
00:45:07.32 --> 00:45:09.32
You're kind of half driving and half paying attention.

1080
00:45:09.32 --> 00:45:11.44
I'm over here talking or doing whatever.

1081
00:45:11.44 --> 00:45:12.44
Guess what?

1082
00:45:12.44 --> 00:45:13.44
We made a mistake.

1083
00:45:13.44 --> 00:45:14.44
It's not going to happen again.

1084
00:45:14.44 --> 00:45:15.44
I got this.

1085
00:45:15.44 --> 00:45:17.28
Hey, right turn, coming up 500 meters.

1086
00:45:17.28 --> 00:45:18.84
Right turn.

1087
00:45:18.84 --> 00:45:20.88
Getting the left hand lane, prepare to go, you know what I mean?

1088
00:45:20.88 --> 00:45:23.08
That's what we saw the problem.

1089
00:45:23.08 --> 00:45:28.64
And to think in the beginning, you know, you get there and you say, hey, here's the problem.

1090
00:45:28.64 --> 00:45:30.24
Here's what we're going to do fix it.

1091
00:45:30.24 --> 00:45:32.48
It's not, hey, everything's my fault.

1092
00:45:32.48 --> 00:45:34.76
That's not extreme ownership isn't.

1093
00:45:34.76 --> 00:45:36.64
Hey, everything's my fault.

1094
00:45:36.64 --> 00:45:40.000
Everything's my fault.

1095
00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:41.88
And now can you just leave me alone?

1096
00:45:41.88 --> 00:45:42.88
No.

1097
00:45:42.88 --> 00:45:43.88
Especially not in that case.

1098
00:45:43.88 --> 00:45:47.52
You actually have to take ownership of the problems.

1099
00:45:47.52 --> 00:45:50.40
I said that over and over again.

1100
00:45:50.40 --> 00:45:52.08
But hey, you know what?

1101
00:45:52.08 --> 00:45:53.08
Just like you did, too.

1102
00:45:53.08 --> 00:45:55.76
You got to see a move a bunch of different times, a bunch of different ways.

1103
00:45:55.76 --> 00:45:56.76
Yeah.

1104
00:45:56.76 --> 00:45:59.76
A bunch of different ways before you start to truly understand it.

1105
00:45:59.76 --> 00:46:00.76
Yeah.

1106
00:46:00.76 --> 00:46:03.08
Take that to everything.

1107
00:46:03.08 --> 00:46:05.68
Do you ever hear yourself make an excuse?

1108
00:46:05.68 --> 00:46:06.68
No.

1109
00:46:06.68 --> 00:46:07.68
Not anymore.

1110
00:46:07.68 --> 00:46:08.68
No.

1111
00:46:08.68 --> 00:46:09.68
I know.

1112
00:46:09.68 --> 00:46:11.48
You know how like how you say, you can feel it.

1113
00:46:11.48 --> 00:46:12.48
Yeah.

1114
00:46:12.48 --> 00:46:13.48
Right.

1115
00:46:13.48 --> 00:46:14.88
You can see those excuses coming up my way.

1116
00:46:14.88 --> 00:46:17.32
And there's a thing you have them in your head.

1117
00:46:17.32 --> 00:46:19.72
Excuse is complaining.

1118
00:46:19.72 --> 00:46:21.72
Complain about how you feel.

1119
00:46:21.72 --> 00:46:23.32
You know, like when there's something to be done.

1120
00:46:23.32 --> 00:46:25.92
I'm not saying, you know, in every single case, but when there's something to be done,

1121
00:46:25.92 --> 00:46:28.52
be like, I'm tired of doing this or, I don't know whatever.

1122
00:46:28.52 --> 00:46:29.52
That's just around the example.

1123
00:46:29.52 --> 00:46:32.32
But man, I can see that stuff coming up my way.

1124
00:46:32.32 --> 00:46:33.32
Yeah.

1125
00:46:33.32 --> 00:46:34.32
No.

1126
00:46:34.32 --> 00:46:38.32
It's definitely something that you get used to and you get good at.

1127
00:46:38.32 --> 00:46:39.32
Yeah.

1128
00:46:39.32 --> 00:46:40.32
You get good at it.

1129
00:46:40.32 --> 00:46:48.08
You get good at saying, you get good at not saying, well, you know.

1130
00:46:48.08 --> 00:46:53.96
One of my assistant, Paltoon commanders, who's an awesome guy.

1131
00:46:53.96 --> 00:46:54.96
And he had this thing.

1132
00:46:54.96 --> 00:47:01.28
If he was going to disagree with me, he would say the word well.

1133
00:47:01.28 --> 00:47:03.52
Well, what's the thing about him?

1134
00:47:03.52 --> 00:47:05.52
But he had a funny way of saying it.

1135
00:47:05.52 --> 00:47:06.52
Yeah, yeah.

1136
00:47:06.52 --> 00:47:10.24
He would say, well, like that.

1137
00:47:10.24 --> 00:47:13.24
And so I'd say, hey, you know, how are you going to do this?

1138
00:47:13.24 --> 00:47:17.60
And he'd come up with his plan and I'd say, what about this on the plan?

1139
00:47:17.60 --> 00:47:19.76
You might want to come in for the north and set it from the west.

1140
00:47:19.76 --> 00:47:22.24
And he'd go, well.

1141
00:47:22.24 --> 00:47:27.88
And then I'd say, after a while, that became a code word for you're about to get

1142
00:47:27.88 --> 00:47:28.88
to you.

1143
00:47:28.88 --> 00:47:29.88
Yeah.

1144
00:47:29.88 --> 00:47:32.20
But he's a toad.

1145
00:47:32.20 --> 00:47:34.60
But he's an awesome guy.

1146
00:47:34.60 --> 00:47:35.60
Jack.

1147
00:47:35.60 --> 00:47:36.60
Whoa.

1148
00:47:36.60 --> 00:47:40.04
Don't tell me you're seeing me.

1149
00:47:40.04 --> 00:47:41.60
This is the next one.

1150
00:47:41.60 --> 00:47:43.60
A joke.

1151
00:47:43.60 --> 00:47:49.20
I've had discipline equals freedom, audio on repeat since it's release.

1152
00:47:49.20 --> 00:47:50.84
And I love it.

1153
00:47:50.84 --> 00:47:51.84
Question.

1154
00:47:51.84 --> 00:47:56.84
If our greatest strength is our greatest weakness, then how is discipline, which is obviously

1155
00:47:56.84 --> 00:47:59.56
your strength, your great sweetness.

1156
00:47:59.56 --> 00:48:07.88
First of all, I don't even know what discipline would be my greatest strength.

1157
00:48:07.88 --> 00:48:08.88
I don't know.

1158
00:48:08.88 --> 00:48:11.08
I mean, I'm a discipline person.

1159
00:48:11.08 --> 00:48:12.64
No doubt.

1160
00:48:12.64 --> 00:48:22.40
But I think that I think that one of the things that people would find interesting is that

1161
00:48:22.40 --> 00:48:27.40
I'm not overly orderly.

1162
00:48:27.40 --> 00:48:33.08
So if you think about those psychological characteristics, one of them is extreme orderliness,

1163
00:48:33.08 --> 00:48:36.52
which normally goes hand in hand with highly disciplined people.

1164
00:48:36.52 --> 00:48:47.08
No those people that are, they're just ultra-highly disciplined, but they have to have everything.

1165
00:48:47.08 --> 00:48:50.68
They're OCD orderly.

1166
00:48:50.68 --> 00:48:55.60
And I'm not like that about a lot of things.

1167
00:48:55.60 --> 00:48:58.32
I am about something, but it's pretty funny.

1168
00:48:58.32 --> 00:49:06.20
Actually, my floor in my garage, where I work out, is not clean.

1169
00:49:06.20 --> 00:49:10.32
It's got salt stains on it from sweat.

1170
00:49:10.32 --> 00:49:13.04
And it's dirty, right?

1171
00:49:13.04 --> 00:49:16.04
And occasionally I'll get someone say, you should clean that floor.

1172
00:49:16.04 --> 00:49:18.04
Or even, you should clean that floor, man.

1173
00:49:18.04 --> 00:49:19.44
That's nasty.

1174
00:49:19.44 --> 00:49:21.64
But it's totally functional.

1175
00:49:21.64 --> 00:49:25.76
My point is that I don't freak out about it.

1176
00:49:25.76 --> 00:49:27.000
It's functional.

1177
00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:29.04
It doesn't bother me at all.

1178
00:49:29.04 --> 00:49:30.88
That is not perfectly orderly.

1179
00:49:30.88 --> 00:49:34.68
This also means that I don't mind when things don't go as planned, right?

1180
00:49:34.68 --> 00:49:39.08
So a lot of the times you get people that are high end of disciplined, they're too, they're

1181
00:49:39.08 --> 00:49:40.40
too far, they're not balanced.

1182
00:49:40.40 --> 00:49:44.72
So now when things don't go the way, that they've planned things to go, they start

1183
00:49:44.72 --> 00:49:45.72
to lose it a little bit.

1184
00:49:45.72 --> 00:49:47.12
They can't deal with it.

1185
00:49:47.12 --> 00:49:50.52
They want to have everything in order all the time.

1186
00:49:50.52 --> 00:49:51.96
I'll tell you, that's not the way life works.

1187
00:49:51.96 --> 00:49:53.80
That's certainly not the way combat works.

1188
00:49:53.80 --> 00:49:56.28
But that's not the way life works.

1189
00:49:56.28 --> 00:49:57.56
And I don't really mind that.

1190
00:49:57.56 --> 00:50:01.000
I don't mind chaos.

1191
00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:10.40
So I would say, probably if you look at discipline as a strength, I don't think that would

1192
00:50:10.40 --> 00:50:17.44
be generally considered the weaknesses of being hyper-discipline is that you can't stand

1193
00:50:17.44 --> 00:50:19.48
when things are not in order.

1194
00:50:19.48 --> 00:50:20.48
You can't stand.

1195
00:50:20.48 --> 00:50:21.72
Like, I missed a workout.

1196
00:50:21.72 --> 00:50:22.72
This is all the way.

1197
00:50:22.72 --> 00:50:24.72
You know, you freak out completely.

1198
00:50:24.72 --> 00:50:27.16
Like, you know, okay, I don't like missing a workout.

1199
00:50:27.16 --> 00:50:29.96
But I don't lose my mind over it.

1200
00:50:29.96 --> 00:50:30.96
Yeah.

1201
00:50:30.96 --> 00:50:38.000
Now, all that being said, I would say that I am a very much a creature of habit.

1202
00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:40.20
And I do like to do the same things over and over again.

1203
00:50:40.20 --> 00:50:41.20
I don't like to travel.

1204
00:50:41.20 --> 00:50:44.76
Even though I have to travel all the time and I don't like to travel other stay home.

1205
00:50:44.76 --> 00:50:49.44
I pretty much eat the same food all the time and go to the same three or four restaurants

1206
00:50:49.44 --> 00:50:50.44
all the time.

1207
00:50:50.44 --> 00:50:51.44
Yeah.

1208
00:50:51.44 --> 00:50:52.44
Right?

1209
00:50:52.44 --> 00:50:55.24
I like to follow routine as much as I can.

1210
00:50:55.24 --> 00:50:57.24
You know, it's even in Gigiitu.

1211
00:50:57.24 --> 00:51:01.08
I do the same basic movements all the time.

1212
00:51:01.08 --> 00:51:02.08
I have the same.

1213
00:51:02.08 --> 00:51:03.68
You know, I've talked about like a funnel.

1214
00:51:03.68 --> 00:51:07.88
Like everywhere that you go with me, it's going to lead to where I want you to be.

1215
00:51:07.88 --> 00:51:09.84
Because I'm going to use those same moves.

1216
00:51:09.84 --> 00:51:13.20
I surf the same spot all the time.

1217
00:51:13.20 --> 00:51:20.52
So I guess for me, the way that discipline is weakness or whatever for me is that I

1218
00:51:20.52 --> 00:51:24.24
think I'm, I could be fairly boring and predictable.

1219
00:51:24.24 --> 00:51:26.24
Yeah, for other people.

1220
00:51:26.24 --> 00:51:27.24
Yeah.

1221
00:51:27.24 --> 00:51:32.96
I think like you know, people say, you want to go try this thing and I'm like, oh, no.

1222
00:51:32.96 --> 00:51:33.96
Not really.

1223
00:51:33.96 --> 00:51:34.96
Not really.

1224
00:51:34.96 --> 00:51:35.96
Yeah.

1225
00:51:35.96 --> 00:51:36.96
I don't really want to.

1226
00:51:36.96 --> 00:51:37.96
I think you're right about that though.

1227
00:51:37.96 --> 00:51:38.96
Yeah.

1228
00:51:38.96 --> 00:51:39.96
Because I'm the same thing.

1229
00:51:39.96 --> 00:51:44.000
Are you the same way?

1230
00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:45.000
Highly disciplined.

1231
00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:46.000
That's true.

1232
00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:47.000
I'm not highly disciplined.

1233
00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:50.20
But like the same stuff over and over again.

1234
00:51:50.20 --> 00:51:51.20
The funny.

1235
00:51:51.20 --> 00:51:54.96
I go to, I don't even like new movies.

1236
00:51:54.96 --> 00:51:55.96
Oh, dang.

1237
00:51:55.96 --> 00:51:56.96
Okay.

1238
00:51:56.96 --> 00:51:57.96
You're the same.

1239
00:51:57.96 --> 00:52:00.56
Like, oh, you know what?

1240
00:52:00.56 --> 00:52:03.92
I haven't had time to watch movies for a long time.

1241
00:52:03.92 --> 00:52:05.52
But when I used to watch movies, big, oh, okay.

1242
00:52:05.52 --> 00:52:06.96
I'm going to watch the big, the bounce key.

1243
00:52:06.96 --> 00:52:07.96
Again.

1244
00:52:07.96 --> 00:52:08.96
Yeah.

1245
00:52:08.96 --> 00:52:09.80
Yeah.

1246
00:52:09.80 --> 00:52:11.60
But big, the bounce key is a kind of movie that, okay.

1247
00:52:11.60 --> 00:52:12.60
So movies are different.

1248
00:52:12.60 --> 00:52:14.24
I'm not going to hold things about this.

1249
00:52:14.24 --> 00:52:19.80
But there's two types of different movies in this situation.

1250
00:52:19.80 --> 00:52:21.08
There's movies that are like awesome.

1251
00:52:21.08 --> 00:52:22.08
Good storyline.

1252
00:52:22.08 --> 00:52:24.80
Maybe a great reveal at the end or twist or whatever.

1253
00:52:24.80 --> 00:52:26.80
And it's like good story.

1254
00:52:26.80 --> 00:52:30.48
And then there's like the type of movie that's just a series of good parts where the

1255
00:52:30.48 --> 00:52:32.12
story doesn't really matter that much.

1256
00:52:32.12 --> 00:52:33.12
Sometimes good.

1257
00:52:33.12 --> 00:52:34.12
Sometimes it's a junk.

1258
00:52:34.12 --> 00:52:35.12
But it's less about that.

1259
00:52:35.12 --> 00:52:36.12
It's more about the, like, the good parts.

1260
00:52:36.12 --> 00:52:37.12
Oh, this part.

1261
00:52:37.12 --> 00:52:38.12
And that's how the big, the bounce key is.

1262
00:52:38.12 --> 00:52:40.72
Like, it's just a series of really good parts.

1263
00:52:40.72 --> 00:52:41.72
Yeah.

1264
00:52:41.72 --> 00:52:42.72
And it's awesome.

1265
00:52:42.72 --> 00:52:43.72
Yeah.

1266
00:52:43.72 --> 00:52:44.72
Yeah.

1267
00:52:44.72 --> 00:52:45.72
That's what I mean.

1268
00:52:45.72 --> 00:52:46.72
I think they're both awesome.

1269
00:52:46.72 --> 00:52:47.72
But the ones that have the other one.

1270
00:52:47.72 --> 00:52:48.72
The just the storylines also like, okay.

1271
00:52:48.72 --> 00:52:51.32
You know, like, I can't think of anything.

1272
00:52:51.32 --> 00:52:54.76
I thought my head, but big LeBoski is one of those like, you know, like Napoleon, dynamite.

1273
00:52:54.76 --> 00:52:55.76
Yeah.

1274
00:52:55.76 --> 00:52:56.76
Yeah.

1275
00:52:56.76 --> 00:52:57.76
Like, that's another one.

1276
00:52:57.76 --> 00:52:58.76
It's just a bunch of good parts.

1277
00:52:58.76 --> 00:52:59.76
Who cares about what happens if they're in fact?

1278
00:52:59.76 --> 00:53:00.76
You probably forget really.

1279
00:53:00.76 --> 00:53:02.40
I mean, you remember what happens if they're in the end.

1280
00:53:02.40 --> 00:53:03.40
Yeah.

1281
00:53:03.40 --> 00:53:04.40
But it's for the storylines, you don't really care.

1282
00:53:04.40 --> 00:53:07.12
But you'll watch it over and over because all the parts are funny or good.

1283
00:53:07.12 --> 00:53:08.12
Whatever.

1284
00:53:08.12 --> 00:53:09.88
Like, point break.

1285
00:53:09.88 --> 00:53:12.16
For example, I know we talked about the first point break.

1286
00:53:12.16 --> 00:53:13.16
Yeah.

1287
00:53:13.16 --> 00:53:14.16
Yeah.

1288
00:53:14.16 --> 00:53:15.16
That's a series of great parts like this.

1289
00:53:15.16 --> 00:53:17.16
I'm sure I've been more the skydiving part.

1290
00:53:17.16 --> 00:53:19.000
The all the parts, they're just really fun.

1291
00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:20.36
I mean, sure the story is good.

1292
00:53:20.36 --> 00:53:21.36
It's cool.

1293
00:53:21.36 --> 00:53:22.36
It's fine.

1294
00:53:22.36 --> 00:53:23.36
We'll say that, but that's not the point.

1295
00:53:23.36 --> 00:53:25.56
The point is like, you know, anyway.

1296
00:53:25.56 --> 00:53:26.56
Check.

1297
00:53:26.56 --> 00:53:27.56
Back to the point though.

1298
00:53:27.56 --> 00:53:30.84
Is, oh, when we're talking about like being repetitive, like, like, you can

1299
00:53:30.84 --> 00:53:31.84
be the same thing.

1300
00:53:31.84 --> 00:53:32.84
Yeah.

1301
00:53:32.84 --> 00:53:33.84
We're not really boring.

1302
00:53:33.84 --> 00:53:34.84
I'm boring.

1303
00:53:34.84 --> 00:53:35.84
Yeah.

1304
00:53:35.84 --> 00:53:36.84
Right.

1305
00:53:36.84 --> 00:53:37.84
We're at a lot of sushi all the time.

1306
00:53:37.84 --> 00:53:40.60
And there's a sushi restaurant within walking this in some house.

1307
00:53:40.60 --> 00:53:41.92
Like, it's like, we're like, I drive.

1308
00:53:41.92 --> 00:53:44.12
But I go there like, not as much.

1309
00:53:44.12 --> 00:53:46.000
I'll probably go like maybe three times a week now.

1310
00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:49.72
But there is a point where I was going five to six times a week for real.

1311
00:53:49.72 --> 00:53:52.24
And there's times where I go more than one to the day.

1312
00:53:52.24 --> 00:53:59.12
So, of course, they just love me and my brother goes to, so yeah, they just love me

1313
00:53:59.12 --> 00:54:00.12
in there.

1314
00:54:00.12 --> 00:54:01.12
Because we're going again again.

1315
00:54:01.12 --> 00:54:05.80
We're just pretty, probably responsible for a significant portion of their revenue.

1316
00:54:05.80 --> 00:54:06.80
My wife, she's not like that.

1317
00:54:06.80 --> 00:54:07.80
Oh, she likes the difference.

1318
00:54:07.80 --> 00:54:10.80
I'm saying, yeah, it's like for writing and whatever.

1319
00:54:10.80 --> 00:54:14.44
And so my wife will say, you know, well, let's say we're going to go out for dinner.

1320
00:54:14.44 --> 00:54:15.80
That's trying something different.

1321
00:54:15.80 --> 00:54:16.80
Yeah.

1322
00:54:16.80 --> 00:54:18.80
I said, okay, tell me where.

1323
00:54:18.80 --> 00:54:19.80
Yeah.

1324
00:54:19.80 --> 00:54:20.80
But she knows what we're doing.

1325
00:54:20.80 --> 00:54:21.80
Yeah.

1326
00:54:21.80 --> 00:54:22.80
Yeah.

1327
00:54:22.80 --> 00:54:23.80
So we just go to old things.

1328
00:54:23.80 --> 00:54:24.80
Yeah.

1329
00:54:24.80 --> 00:54:25.80
Yeah.

1330
00:54:25.80 --> 00:54:26.80
Yeah.

1331
00:54:26.80 --> 00:54:27.80
Saying at least you have a few, like, different spots.

1332
00:54:27.80 --> 00:54:28.80
Yeah.

1333
00:54:28.80 --> 00:54:30.80
I have two on their both sushi places.

1334
00:54:30.80 --> 00:54:33.80
So it's like, and it goes for like what we do, too.

1335
00:54:33.80 --> 00:54:35.80
So during the weekend, it's like really repetitive.

1336
00:54:35.80 --> 00:54:36.80
Yeah.

1337
00:54:36.80 --> 00:54:41.80
My wife uses the word groundhog day planning like a lot to speak in our great movies.

1338
00:54:41.80 --> 00:54:42.80
Oh, no.

1339
00:54:42.80 --> 00:54:43.80
That's another one.

1340
00:54:43.80 --> 00:54:44.80
Great parts of a bunch of great parts.

1341
00:54:44.80 --> 00:54:46.80
But really who cares at the end?

1342
00:54:46.80 --> 00:54:47.80
You know, like the story, what's that?

1343
00:54:47.80 --> 00:54:48.80
What's that movie really about that?

1344
00:54:48.80 --> 00:54:50.80
What's the story about that movie?

1345
00:54:50.80 --> 00:54:51.80
You know, no.

1346
00:54:51.80 --> 00:54:52.80
Yeah, I totally know.

1347
00:54:52.80 --> 00:54:53.80
I've seen it in a fun time.

1348
00:54:53.80 --> 00:54:54.80
Like what?

1349
00:54:54.80 --> 00:54:56.80
You got to be nice to the girls for the groundhog.

1350
00:54:56.80 --> 00:54:57.80
Out day stops.

1351
00:54:57.80 --> 00:54:59.80
Like, why don't I know what them either?

1352
00:54:59.80 --> 00:55:00.80
Yeah.

1353
00:55:00.80 --> 00:55:01.80
Yeah.

1354
00:55:01.80 --> 00:55:03.80
It doesn't even make sense like that, but it's a good movie.

1355
00:55:03.80 --> 00:55:05.80
Anyway, so that was a point of making a movie.

1356
00:55:05.80 --> 00:55:07.80
But yeah.

1357
00:55:07.80 --> 00:55:13.80
So my point is with this is that, yeah, you will be boring because my wife thinks I'm boring in that way.

1358
00:55:13.80 --> 00:55:15.80
Or it's like, it's just the same old same old.

1359
00:55:15.80 --> 00:55:17.80
Every single time I'm like, probably I love the same old same old.

1360
00:55:17.80 --> 00:55:20.80
Like, I want to try to go on to this all inclusive thing or whatever.

1361
00:55:20.80 --> 00:55:23.80
It's just like, oh, it's just like, oh, this is like way better.

1362
00:55:23.80 --> 00:55:26.80
You know, and yeah, so yeah, I think you're right.

1363
00:55:26.80 --> 00:55:27.80
I think that might be.

1364
00:55:27.80 --> 00:55:30.80
But so if you think discipline isn't your biggest strength, what is, what do you think you're big?

1365
00:55:30.80 --> 00:55:31.80
Oh, I don't know.

1366
00:55:31.80 --> 00:55:33.80
I don't think I have any real big strength.

1367
00:55:33.80 --> 00:55:34.80
You know what I think it is?

1368
00:55:34.80 --> 00:55:37.80
I think it's, it's argument maybe discipline.

1369
00:55:37.80 --> 00:55:39.80
Yeah, maybe maybe not, but you know what I think?

1370
00:55:39.80 --> 00:55:40.80
Actually balance.

1371
00:55:40.80 --> 00:55:41.80
Yep.

1372
00:55:41.80 --> 00:55:43.80
Not many of you are balanced.

1373
00:55:43.80 --> 00:55:44.80
Nope.

1374
00:55:44.80 --> 00:55:45.80
You're pretty balanced.

1375
00:55:45.80 --> 00:55:46.80
Yep.

1376
00:55:46.80 --> 00:55:48.80
You know what I think it is?

1377
00:55:48.80 --> 00:55:50.80
Well, you told it to me too.

1378
00:55:50.80 --> 00:55:52.80
Oh, you're durable.

1379
00:55:52.80 --> 00:55:54.80
Oh, in terms of physical.

1380
00:55:54.80 --> 00:55:56.80
I think you've been mental too though.

1381
00:55:56.80 --> 00:55:58.80
That's the thing, like you're, you're like a durable person.

1382
00:55:58.80 --> 00:56:12.80
You know how people, like you've told me stories of what I'm going to, but you told me stories about someone who made huge mistakes, you know, with you, and you, like handle it, and it doesn't seem like it, like bothers you.

1383
00:56:12.80 --> 00:56:14.80
You know, like that kind of stuff.

1384
00:56:14.80 --> 00:56:16.80
Stuff that like, yeah, no, I do.

1385
00:56:16.80 --> 00:56:19.80
Well, and you know, to me, I guess that's balanced to me.

1386
00:56:19.80 --> 00:56:20.80
Yeah.

1387
00:56:20.80 --> 00:56:25.80
But to me, balances, I don't, I don't, it's, it's also boring.

1388
00:56:25.80 --> 00:56:26.80
Right?

1389
00:56:26.80 --> 00:56:28.80
Go far and wander around the other direction.

1390
00:56:28.80 --> 00:56:31.80
I don't get extreme about this or extreme about that.

1391
00:56:31.80 --> 00:56:37.80
I just, I think that's what has been good for me.

1392
00:56:37.80 --> 00:56:38.80
Yeah.

1393
00:56:38.80 --> 00:56:40.80
Was I never freaked out about stuff?

1394
00:56:40.80 --> 00:56:43.80
Much, much, much stuff.

1395
00:56:43.80 --> 00:56:47.80
Yeah, that, yeah, that makes sense.

1396
00:56:47.80 --> 00:56:49.80
Next question.

1397
00:56:49.80 --> 00:56:51.80
What's your biggest strength?

1398
00:56:51.80 --> 00:56:52.80
My biggest strength.

1399
00:56:52.80 --> 00:56:53.80
Yeah.

1400
00:56:53.80 --> 00:56:55.80
I'll tell you what I think your biggest strength is.

1401
00:56:55.80 --> 00:56:56.80
You're humble.

1402
00:56:56.80 --> 00:56:57.80
You're super humble.

1403
00:56:57.80 --> 00:56:58.80
Yeah.

1404
00:56:58.80 --> 00:56:59.80
I can't get help.

1405
00:56:59.80 --> 00:57:02.80
Just the other day, you were telling me you were the most humble guy in the world.

1406
00:57:02.80 --> 00:57:04.80
Nobody's more humble than me.

1407
00:57:04.80 --> 00:57:06.80
That was actually joke.

1408
00:57:06.80 --> 00:57:08.80
No, I didn't know you're so funny though.

1409
00:57:08.80 --> 00:57:09.80
It was awful.

1410
00:57:09.80 --> 00:57:11.80
I forget who said that joke for, yeah.

1411
00:57:11.80 --> 00:57:12.80
Yeah.

1412
00:57:12.80 --> 00:57:17.80
Maybe I had, I had one of the most egotistical persons that I've ever known.

1413
00:57:17.80 --> 00:57:20.80
Like, I am not kidding about this.

1414
00:57:20.80 --> 00:57:21.80
Yeah.

1415
00:57:21.80 --> 00:57:22.80
Straight up, tell me.

1416
00:57:22.80 --> 00:57:23.80
I have no ego.

1417
00:57:23.80 --> 00:57:24.80
I mean, it was just a joke.

1418
00:57:24.80 --> 00:57:29.80
I mean, it was, it was like, it was completely insane.

1419
00:57:29.80 --> 00:57:30.80
Yeah.

1420
00:57:30.80 --> 00:57:33.80
I couldn't believe that this individual was saying it.

1421
00:57:33.80 --> 00:57:37.80
No, I was just thinking myself, man, that's crazy.

1422
00:57:37.80 --> 00:57:44.80
Ego is, here's the thing, I don't know who you're talking about specifically, but I will say this, where obviously I wasn't.

1423
00:57:44.80 --> 00:57:53.80
Oh, I don't, and this may even go along with the idea that you think that a humble is like, I don't even know if, if I'm humble or not.

1424
00:57:53.80 --> 00:58:00.80
Because I know before I wasn't humble before, and all I thought the world like revolved around me, not necessarily like,

1425
00:58:00.80 --> 00:58:08.80
by the bad way, but just, just how, yeah, it was kind of like if I had certain feelings, like they were just more important than what was kind of going on.

1426
00:58:08.80 --> 00:58:13.80
And it wasn't like necessarily like, errr, like walking, you know, like a dick or nothing like that.

1427
00:58:13.80 --> 00:58:15.80
It was just that's kind of how I felt it, whatever.

1428
00:58:15.80 --> 00:58:22.80
And, you know, complete, you know, you're already butt at the same time.

1429
00:58:22.80 --> 00:58:30.80
When you, when you kind of pointed out that humility is like a super important thing, I was like, okay, how can I, how can I, I mean, okay, I'm going to assume that's true,

1430
00:58:30.80 --> 00:58:40.80
because you know what you're talking about. So what does that even mean? And then what I realized is a big, like, a way to exemplify humility is to, to, I don't know,

1431
00:58:40.80 --> 00:58:46.80
the, the ability to learn things from someone who might not necessarily be an expert, for example, you know, like,

1432
00:58:46.80 --> 00:58:55.80
you can learn stuff from a kid. You can learn stuff from a blue belt. Yeah, yeah, stuff from a white belt. Yeah, so that kind of stuff, but someone with

1433
00:58:55.80 --> 00:59:02.80
you, you go, or be like, hey, I'm a black belt, so for sure. What do you have to say to me, you know, you know, that concept that I did.

1434
00:59:02.80 --> 00:59:09.80
Well, interestingly, in GJ2, you could take it to the extreme of where there was times when people thought you can't learn anything from wrestlers.

1435
00:59:09.80 --> 00:59:14.80
You can't learn anything from judo. You can't learn anything from sambault. You know, that's, that's, that's crazy talk.

1436
00:59:14.80 --> 00:59:19.80
Yeah. You know, and, and the good GJ2 players take it, something from wrestling and take something from judo.

1437
00:59:19.80 --> 00:59:22.80
Take a bunch from wrestling, a bunch from judo, a bunch from sambault.

1438
00:59:22.80 --> 00:59:27.80
And then create their own stuff and watch on YouTube, somebody that does other stuff from a different academy.

1439
00:59:27.80 --> 00:59:34.80
Yeah, a different school. Yeah. So it's almost like there's two different types of humility, where, you know,

1440
00:59:34.80 --> 00:59:39.80
how like someone who's really outwardly, like, um, actually, you've had this example where like,

1441
00:59:39.80 --> 00:59:44.80
like, caught him a Gregor, for example, where, out, like, to, to hear him talk and stuff like that. You be like,

1442
00:59:44.80 --> 00:59:48.80
this guy has a huge ego, whatever. There's no humble. There's no humility with him whenever,

1443
00:59:48.80 --> 00:59:50.80
but like he's learning all this stuff from like people. You be like,

1444
00:59:50.80 --> 00:59:53.80
No, he's learning from a training hard.

1445
00:59:53.80 --> 01:00:00.80
Yeah, because he knows he's humble. Yeah. So what is that, you know, like, is there two kinds of humbleness in your humility?

1446
01:00:00.80 --> 01:00:06.80
I think there kind of, and even if we're to look at it, there's just some level of showmanship with Connor, right?

1447
01:00:06.80 --> 01:00:10.80
Yeah. There's some level of selling fights with Connor, but even at the same time, like, let's say that,

1448
01:00:10.80 --> 01:00:14.80
because there's such thing as people, probably pretty common that people are legitimately like,

1449
01:00:14.80 --> 01:00:19.80
into themselves in that way. Coach, Kevin, we're going to have coach Kevin on this podcast at some point.

1450
01:00:19.80 --> 01:00:23.80
Yeah. Yeah. Cause I've gone back and forth with him on social media.

1451
01:00:23.80 --> 01:00:27.80
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That'd be awesome. Yeah.

1452
01:00:27.80 --> 01:00:31.80
But he can answer that question. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1453
01:00:31.80 --> 01:00:37.80
Just in general, or about Connor. Well, about Connor. Yeah. About Connor. He knows Connor better than anybody.

1454
01:00:37.80 --> 01:00:42.80
But you get people who are legitimately cocky outwardly, you know, kind of like,

1455
01:00:42.80 --> 01:00:48.80
but at the same time, they can learn from, they have the humility to learn from everyone kind of thing.

1456
01:00:48.80 --> 01:00:54.80
Yeah. And you know what it is almost, even. It might not even be necessarily specifically being able to learn from everyone.

1457
01:00:54.80 --> 01:00:58.80
It's more about what you said long time ago.

1458
01:00:58.80 --> 01:01:01.80
And it's like admitting to yourself that you don't know everything. Yeah.

1459
01:01:01.80 --> 01:01:04.80
And you don't necessarily know more than everyone at every single time.

1460
01:01:04.80 --> 01:01:08.80
It's like you have to be humbling up to know that you don't know everything so listen up kind of thing.

1461
01:01:08.80 --> 01:01:12.80
That is the type of thing where even.

1462
01:01:12.80 --> 01:01:15.80
So I will catch myself.

1463
01:01:15.80 --> 01:01:18.80
And I used to catch myself doing that.

1464
01:01:18.80 --> 01:01:21.80
Let's say, one today.

1465
01:01:21.80 --> 01:01:26.80
And then, and then it was one to week. And then it's one to month.

1466
01:01:26.80 --> 01:01:29.80
And it's pretty, it's the last now.

1467
01:01:29.80 --> 01:01:32.80
But sometimes I'll catch myself listening to someone.

1468
01:01:32.80 --> 01:01:35.80
And I'll catch myself thinking, oh, this guy doesn't know what he's talking.

1469
01:01:35.80 --> 01:01:37.80
Yeah. You know what I mean? And as soon as I hear myself saying, what does that mean?

1470
01:01:37.80 --> 01:01:42.80
I can take a different perspective because what can you, not this guy does know anything.

1471
01:01:42.80 --> 01:01:45.80
It's what can you learn from this person.

1472
01:01:45.80 --> 01:01:46.80
Yeah. That's the question.

1473
01:01:46.80 --> 01:01:47.80
Yeah.

1474
01:01:47.80 --> 01:01:48.80
Well, can you learn from him?

1475
01:01:48.80 --> 01:01:50.80
You can learn something from him.

1476
01:01:50.80 --> 01:01:55.80
Even if he's a white belt, even if he's inexperienced, even if he seems completely arrogant and crazy.

1477
01:01:55.80 --> 01:01:56.80
Yeah.

1478
01:01:56.80 --> 01:02:01.80
Even if you're learning how not to act, that's better than just saying, oh, this person.

1479
01:02:01.80 --> 01:02:03.80
Oh, no, listen to this person. I've got nothing to learn.

1480
01:02:03.80 --> 01:02:05.80
No, you do. I do.

1481
01:02:05.80 --> 01:02:09.80
So it's interesting as we talked about how you make excuses.

1482
01:02:09.80 --> 01:02:11.80
You personally make excuses less now.

1483
01:02:11.80 --> 01:02:12.80
I personally make excuses.

1484
01:02:12.80 --> 01:02:16.80
I might be a little ahead of you on that because I figured that out maybe a little bit earlier.

1485
01:02:16.80 --> 01:02:18.80
And I'm older than you.

1486
01:02:18.80 --> 01:02:19.80
Sure.

1487
01:02:19.80 --> 01:02:23.80
But it's, you know, I used to probably make excuses once a day.

1488
01:02:23.80 --> 01:02:24.80
Yeah.

1489
01:02:24.80 --> 01:02:32.80
And then once every three days and once a week, that comes in plenty of the many forms to the whole making excuses.

1490
01:02:32.80 --> 01:02:36.80
Because that's necessarily only me making excuses to others.

1491
01:02:36.80 --> 01:02:37.80
It's like to yourself.

1492
01:02:37.80 --> 01:02:38.80
Oh, for sure.

1493
01:02:38.80 --> 01:02:40.80
For sure. That's the primary.

1494
01:02:40.80 --> 01:02:41.80
Yeah.

1495
01:02:41.80 --> 01:02:42.80
That's the primary.

1496
01:02:42.80 --> 01:02:45.80
The easy one to overcome is making excuses to other people.

1497
01:02:45.80 --> 01:02:48.80
The hard one to overcome is making excuses to yourself.

1498
01:02:48.80 --> 01:02:49.80
Yeah.

1499
01:02:49.80 --> 01:02:51.80
That's the hard one to overcome because it hurts more.

1500
01:02:51.80 --> 01:02:52.80
Yeah.

1501
01:02:52.80 --> 01:03:00.80
The minute you say, well, you know, I didn't get the thing I wanted because of these external forces.

1502
01:03:00.80 --> 01:03:07.80
I mean, these external forces, the minute that you start saying that is the minute that you stop working hard for that thing.

1503
01:03:07.80 --> 01:03:08.80
Yeah.

1504
01:03:08.80 --> 01:03:12.80
Or maneuvering for that thing or adjusting for that thing or getting up early and chasing that thing down.

1505
01:03:12.80 --> 01:03:14.80
It becomes an excuse.

1506
01:03:14.80 --> 01:03:16.80
It becomes an excuse.

1507
01:03:16.80 --> 01:03:17.80
Like, meaning for sure.

1508
01:03:17.80 --> 01:03:18.80
You just excuse yourself.

1509
01:03:18.80 --> 01:03:19.80
You did?

1510
01:03:19.80 --> 01:03:21.80
You just excuse yourself from the workout.

1511
01:03:21.80 --> 01:03:22.80
Yeah.

1512
01:03:22.80 --> 01:03:24.80
But I would say back to the humility thing.

1513
01:03:24.80 --> 01:03:25.80
And I don't know.

1514
01:03:25.80 --> 01:03:32.80
I'm just listening to you at this point where maybe I am because I've always had had at least a little bit of that.

1515
01:03:32.80 --> 01:03:37.80
Where it'd be like, maybe this person right now, even though I hate what they're saying to me.

1516
01:03:37.80 --> 01:03:38.80
What?

1517
01:03:38.80 --> 01:03:39.80
Like, they could be right.

1518
01:03:39.80 --> 01:03:41.80
They could be right about me right now.

1519
01:03:41.80 --> 01:03:43.80
And I think I always had that.

1520
01:03:43.80 --> 01:03:48.80
I think that's why, you know, some people, they just, you talk to me, normal, whatever.

1521
01:03:48.80 --> 01:03:52.80
Like, the chance of this person changing how they are is very low.

1522
01:03:52.80 --> 01:03:53.80
Oh, most people.

1523
01:03:53.80 --> 01:03:54.80
Most people, right?

1524
01:03:54.80 --> 01:03:55.80
Most people, that's right.

1525
01:03:55.80 --> 01:03:56.80
Kind of the same thing.

1526
01:03:56.80 --> 01:03:56.80
That's right.

1527
01:03:56.80 --> 01:03:57.80
Kind of the same experience too.

1528
01:03:57.80 --> 01:03:58.80
But like if you're just a gentleman.

1529
01:03:58.80 --> 01:03:59.80
Yeah.

1530
01:03:59.80 --> 01:04:03.80
Something either really big or something really small has to happen over and over and over.

1531
01:04:03.80 --> 01:04:04.80
No, no, no.

1532
01:04:04.80 --> 01:04:05.80
Like, it's just a different infrastructure.

1533
01:04:05.80 --> 01:04:06.80
Right.

1534
01:04:06.80 --> 01:04:10.80
But I would say legitimately, and I'm trying to look at it as, like, honestly, it's possible where

1535
01:04:10.80 --> 01:04:17.80
me 10 years ago is like, like, if, let's say I know someone and new someone 10 years ago and I have seen them or

1536
01:04:17.80 --> 01:04:19.80
heard from them or whatever in 10 years.

1537
01:04:19.80 --> 01:04:22.80
And they'd like hung out with me for a week.

1538
01:04:22.80 --> 01:04:24.80
They would be blown away.

1539
01:04:24.80 --> 01:04:25.80
They'd be like, you're just way different.

1540
01:04:25.80 --> 01:04:27.80
You're like a whole different person.

1541
01:04:27.80 --> 01:04:28.80
It's the same with me.

1542
01:04:28.80 --> 01:04:31.80
I mean, so, so this is funny.

1543
01:04:31.80 --> 01:04:33.80
There's a bar in San Diego.

1544
01:04:33.80 --> 01:04:34.80
Sure.

1545
01:04:34.80 --> 01:04:37.80
That I used to go to when I was parking the stairs back in the teams.

1546
01:04:37.80 --> 01:04:38.80
And of course.

1547
01:04:38.80 --> 01:04:39.80
And I was, yes.

1548
01:04:39.80 --> 01:04:41.80
And I was a wild.

1549
01:04:41.80 --> 01:04:42.80
Yeah.

1550
01:04:42.80 --> 01:04:43.80
I was a wild.

1551
01:04:43.80 --> 01:04:44.80
Yeah.

1552
01:04:44.80 --> 01:04:46.80
And there was a guy that,

1553
01:04:46.80 --> 01:04:49.80
was a DJ there.

1554
01:04:49.80 --> 01:04:50.80
Sure.

1555
01:04:50.80 --> 01:04:52.80
And I didn't even recognize it.

1556
01:04:52.80 --> 01:04:55.80
I was usually not in a state to even be paying attention to those kind of things.

1557
01:04:55.80 --> 01:05:00.80
Anyways, to make a long story short, I decided I was going to put it in an officer package.

1558
01:05:00.80 --> 01:05:07.80
And I put together the package and I went into the administrative office at Seal Team 1.

1559
01:05:07.80 --> 01:05:09.80
And I talked to the chief that was in there.

1560
01:05:09.80 --> 01:05:11.80
And I said, hey, how you doing chief?

1561
01:05:11.80 --> 01:05:13.80
You know, I'm putting this package.

1562
01:05:13.80 --> 01:05:16.80
And I was just wanting you to take a look at it.

1563
01:05:16.80 --> 01:05:18.80
You know, if there's anything you see, I should add.

1564
01:05:18.80 --> 01:05:21.80
And he looked at me, he goes, I hear putting it in a package.

1565
01:05:21.80 --> 01:05:22.80
And I said, yeah.

1566
01:05:22.80 --> 01:05:25.80
And he goes, oh, that's, I wouldn't expect that for a minute.

1567
01:05:25.80 --> 01:05:26.80
Yeah, it's surprising.

1568
01:05:26.80 --> 01:05:28.80
And I was kind of, why not?

1569
01:05:28.80 --> 01:05:35.80
He goes, you know, I'm the DJ on this bar on these nights.

1570
01:05:35.80 --> 01:05:38.80
And I've been that for, you know, five years.

1571
01:05:38.80 --> 01:05:41.80
And I said, I was not aware of that.

1572
01:05:41.80 --> 01:05:45.80
You know, in his mind, he was thinking, that's what he knew me as.

1573
01:05:45.80 --> 01:05:47.80
He didn't really know me because he's in the admin office.

1574
01:05:47.80 --> 01:05:50.80
He wouldn't really know me from anything else.

1575
01:05:50.80 --> 01:05:53.80
And that was a little bit of a wakeup call.

1576
01:05:53.80 --> 01:06:02.80
But that, so my point is, I want to, I should not, I should never come off as a saint.

1577
01:06:02.80 --> 01:06:03.80
Yeah, that's all.

1578
01:06:03.80 --> 01:06:04.80
He does.

1579
01:06:04.80 --> 01:06:05.80
Yeah, for sure.

1580
01:06:05.80 --> 01:06:06.80
For sure, not at all.

1581
01:06:06.80 --> 01:06:10.80
And even, you know, to this day, still work and still trying to figure things out.

1582
01:06:10.80 --> 01:06:15.80
But, but definitely back in the day, I was an idiot.

1583
01:06:15.80 --> 01:06:16.80
I had fun.

1584
01:06:16.80 --> 01:06:20.80
Yeah, I had fun, but I was, did a lot of dumb stuff.

1585
01:06:20.80 --> 01:06:29.80
Yeah, but you're, I mean, and, and I, I believe you 100% where you were probably a certain way back then.

1586
01:06:29.80 --> 01:06:32.80
And whatever it, it was fun, it was all this or whatever.

1587
01:06:32.80 --> 01:06:39.80
And, but you legitimately changed a bunch or a big part of fundamentally who you are with being open.

1588
01:06:39.80 --> 01:06:45.80
To like, critique and criticism and learning and whatever.

1589
01:06:45.80 --> 01:06:51.80
And I think, yeah, I think the biggest thing is I had open eyes.

1590
01:06:51.80 --> 01:06:52.80
You know what I mean?

1591
01:06:52.80 --> 01:06:57.80
And as I moved into leadership position, I saw how other people perceived me.

1592
01:06:57.80 --> 01:07:00.80
And I saw the importance of leadership.

1593
01:07:00.80 --> 01:07:05.80
And, yeah, I mean, you just, you just have to change.

1594
01:07:05.80 --> 01:07:07.80
And that's something that, as a leader,

1595
01:07:07.80 --> 01:07:10.80
you, you see this all the time.

1596
01:07:10.80 --> 01:07:14.80
What got you here isn't necessarily what's going to get you there.

1597
01:07:14.80 --> 01:07:15.80
Yeah.

1598
01:07:15.80 --> 01:07:22.80
And so if you have leaders that, if they were aggressive, go cowboy when they were out in the field, that's great.

1599
01:07:22.80 --> 01:07:25.80
But when you, you, you, you have to, you don't have to stop that.

1600
01:07:25.80 --> 01:07:27.80
But you have to put some reins on it.

1601
01:07:27.80 --> 01:07:29.80
You have to, you have to reign it in a little bit.

1602
01:07:29.80 --> 01:07:32.80
The more senior you get, the more you become accountable to a board,

1603
01:07:32.80 --> 01:07:36.80
the more you become accountable to being a publicly traded company.

1604
01:07:36.80 --> 01:07:40.80
And the more you become accountable to the actions you're in the military still.

1605
01:07:40.80 --> 01:07:48.80
And what, the way you're going to be seen, the way your unit is going to be seen and perceived by other senior leaders.

1606
01:07:48.80 --> 01:07:49.80
Those are real things.

1607
01:07:49.80 --> 01:07:53.80
And if you don't grow up, you don't make the progress that you need to make.

1608
01:07:53.80 --> 01:07:55.80
And I was lucky enough to see that.

1609
01:07:55.80 --> 01:07:59.80
You know, I had some great examples of along the way, great leaders that I work for.

1610
01:07:59.80 --> 01:08:02.80
But it can be hard to see that.

1611
01:08:02.80 --> 01:08:03.80
Yeah.

1612
01:08:03.80 --> 01:08:10.80
And now that's a good, like, expression when you said, I, I, I opened my eyes or I went in with open eyes.

1613
01:08:10.80 --> 01:08:14.80
I, I don't even know how to describe it.

1614
01:08:14.80 --> 01:08:26.80
But I just was aware of what was happening a little bit more than normal or a little bit enough to make the changes, I guess.

1615
01:08:26.80 --> 01:08:27.80
Yeah.

1616
01:08:27.80 --> 01:08:28.80
And that's the hard part.

1617
01:08:28.80 --> 01:08:39.80
Yeah. And I think it is because of like I said, like your ego and it's hard for me to even really say that because like even when I say that word ego, it really like it registers as like this external.

1618
01:08:39.80 --> 01:08:43.80
Oh, they go walking around with his chest out and I don't know his mohawk.

1619
01:08:43.80 --> 01:08:44.80
I don't know whatever.

1620
01:08:44.80 --> 01:08:45.80
It's like that.

1621
01:08:45.80 --> 01:08:46.80
It's an extra expression, but it's not.

1622
01:08:46.80 --> 01:08:55.80
It's like, it's like being able to kind of shed the blinders on self critique.

1623
01:08:55.80 --> 01:09:02.80
And so, you know, when someone tells you, hey, like you're, you're kind of acting this way, you're kind of this way and to be able to be

1624
01:09:02.80 --> 01:09:06.80
to figure to yourself that this person could be right first.

1625
01:09:06.80 --> 01:09:10.80
And then be mad at the fact that they just insulted you second.

1626
01:09:10.80 --> 01:09:11.80
Of course, that's going to be part of it.

1627
01:09:11.80 --> 01:09:12.80
I understand.

1628
01:09:12.80 --> 01:09:22.80
But most times for I think most people would mean including sometimes where the fact that you step to me like that impacts me more than what you're actually saying.

1629
01:09:22.80 --> 01:09:30.80
I mean, but if you don't have the ego in the way that you describe it, you'll hear what they're saying first.

1630
01:09:30.80 --> 01:09:33.80
And then, these guys, whether they're not to be mad at it.

1631
01:09:33.80 --> 01:09:37.80
You know what else is weird, too, is like, as I talk about this stuff.

1632
01:09:37.80 --> 01:09:45.80
Like, like when I talk about detachment now, I used to, I used to not know that word when I would tell guys to do it.

1633
01:09:45.80 --> 01:09:50.80
This is even, you know, not that long ago, you know, but I was telling the teams.

1634
01:09:50.80 --> 01:09:58.80
But it took me a while in the teams while I was trying to tell guys that, but I didn't figure out the word yet.

1635
01:09:58.80 --> 01:10:01.80
You know, we got to, yeah, that's just one example.

1636
01:10:01.80 --> 01:10:05.80
There's a bunch of examples like that where I was trying to convey them.

1637
01:10:05.80 --> 01:10:14.80
I would convey the message, but I didn't just have like a concise way to do it or a clear way to do it, but I was still conveying the same message.

1638
01:10:14.80 --> 01:10:24.80
Right, right. And maybe, and that's another thing that happens is as you get older and you get more experienced, you understand the message yourself better.

1639
01:10:24.80 --> 01:10:28.80
Just like when you teach a detu, or you teach anything, the more you teach it, the better you understand it.

1640
01:10:28.80 --> 01:10:31.80
And so as I taught things, I understood it better.

1641
01:10:31.80 --> 01:10:32.80
Yeah.

1642
01:10:32.80 --> 01:10:34.80
And so that's one thing that I think helps out a lot.

1643
01:10:34.80 --> 01:10:38.80
And this is why it's an answer for me on so many different things with leadership.

1644
01:10:38.80 --> 01:10:41.80
People say, well, what do I do with this young person that doesn't listen to?

1645
01:10:41.80 --> 01:10:44.80
I'm a person that isn't reaching their potential. I was like, I put them in charge of stuff.

1646
01:10:44.80 --> 01:10:47.80
Because that's what I think helped me a lot.

1647
01:10:47.80 --> 01:10:49.80
It was even in my first poll tune.

1648
01:10:49.80 --> 01:11:00.80
When I was a youngest guy and I was the most junior guy in my first poll tune, I was the, I was the head radio man, which meant I was responsible for stuff.

1649
01:11:00.80 --> 01:11:07.80
I which meant I sat through the briefs and I had to help with the planning and I had to do like stuff that was outside my realm of experience.

1650
01:11:07.80 --> 01:11:12.80
And I had to step up and do it. And it seems like a little thing right now.

1651
01:11:12.80 --> 01:11:18.80
But let's say what? When you're 19 years old and you're in charge of the communications for some training exercise,

1652
01:11:18.80 --> 01:11:22.80
and you don't know what that all you're doing, you're step up and figure that stuff out.

1653
01:11:22.80 --> 01:11:23.80
Yeah.

1654
01:11:23.80 --> 01:11:28.80
And that's very, very impactful. So that's what you do with your junior leaders that you want to have them step up and lead.

1655
01:11:28.80 --> 01:11:34.80
You put them in charge of things. You put them that was very lucky that I had leaders that I work for that did that.

1656
01:11:34.80 --> 01:11:40.80
And I've talked about it before. I mean, that leaders that put myself and the other junior guys and put to me in charge of things.

1657
01:11:40.80 --> 01:11:41.80
Yeah.

1658
01:11:41.80 --> 01:11:45.80
Not just not just saying, but actually putting us in charge of things and that's a quick way to grow a leader.

1659
01:11:45.80 --> 01:11:47.80
So I was very lucky that I had that.

1660
01:11:47.80 --> 01:11:52.80
And I think that was one of the things that helped me to see the light, right?

1661
01:11:52.80 --> 01:11:56.80
Was being put in charge of things even at a younger age.

1662
01:11:56.80 --> 01:12:01.80
When do you think like how you just talk about detaching right now,

1663
01:12:01.80 --> 01:12:05.80
where you were trying to convey that message before you even called it detaching.

1664
01:12:05.80 --> 01:12:10.80
When did you understand the importance of that story before?

1665
01:12:10.80 --> 01:12:14.80
I've told the story before here. I was doing oil rigs training.

1666
01:12:14.80 --> 01:12:18.80
And we came up on a platform out of an oil rig. There are different platforms.

1667
01:12:18.80 --> 01:12:19.80
There are different levels, so I should say.

1668
01:12:19.80 --> 01:12:23.80
And we came up on this one platform. I think this was, this was my,

1669
01:12:23.80 --> 01:12:30.80
I'm trying to think this was my first or second, but I'm pretty sure it was my second, but

1670
01:12:30.80 --> 01:12:36.80
and as we came up on this, this level, it was, it was a little confusing.

1671
01:12:36.80 --> 01:12:39.80
And the whole platoon gets online and no one does anything.

1672
01:12:39.80 --> 01:12:43.80
And I basically stood there for a second and then I kind of stepped back off the line a bit

1673
01:12:43.80 --> 01:12:47.80
and I looked around and I said, okay, I see what we should do.

1674
01:12:47.80 --> 01:12:52.80
And I actually said, hold that clear right or whatever this little call was and everyone did it.

1675
01:12:52.80 --> 01:12:57.80
And the only reason I understood that was because I stepped back like a foot and looked around.

1676
01:12:57.80 --> 01:13:02.80
And that's all you, that's all, and I realized right then, oh, if I'm not staring down my gun,

1677
01:13:02.80 --> 01:13:07.80
if I take a step back, if I look around, if I detach, I didn't use that work because I didn't know that word.

1678
01:13:07.80 --> 01:13:11.80
But I said, oh, if you just step back and you high-port your gun and you look around,

1679
01:13:11.80 --> 01:13:14.80
you're going to know way more than anybody else that's staring down their gun.

1680
01:13:14.80 --> 01:13:18.80
And that right there changed my world. It really did.

1681
01:13:18.80 --> 01:13:21.80
It changed my world. And at the time, I didn't think that changed my world.

1682
01:13:21.80 --> 01:13:25.80
I just said, oh, cool, you know what, when people are frozen,

1683
01:13:25.80 --> 01:13:29.80
you take a step back, look around and make a call. Okay, that's cool. That's what I started doing.

1684
01:13:29.80 --> 01:13:34.80
I didn't think it was a big deal at the time. I didn't think it was a big deal until I wasn't in a structure position.

1685
01:13:34.80 --> 01:13:39.80
And I would see everyone staring down their gun and no one making a decision.

1686
01:13:39.80 --> 01:13:42.80
And all I have to do is tell someone, hey, take a step back with me right here.

1687
01:13:42.80 --> 01:13:46.80
One foot back off the firing line and look around. And then go, okay, we can go to this berm right here.

1688
01:13:46.80 --> 01:13:49.80
And we'll be out. Okay, yeah, that's right. Then I started to realize how important it was.

1689
01:13:49.80 --> 01:13:56.80
I started to put, you know, words around it and put, put messaging around it. That it was important.

1690
01:13:56.80 --> 01:14:02.80
And there's an every lesson that I talk about was all kind of learned in that method.

1691
01:14:02.80 --> 01:14:08.80
Yeah, all that was kind of learned by putting put in situations where I had to figure something out or something occurred or I,

1692
01:14:08.80 --> 01:14:13.80
and that's the same thing with my life. I've got put in some situation. It's okay, you know what?

1693
01:14:13.80 --> 01:14:26.80
And what I think might be kind of key about that particular idea of detaching is when you can detach in life, right?

1694
01:14:26.80 --> 01:14:30.80
It gives you this incredible ability to see yourself.

1695
01:14:30.80 --> 01:14:39.80
And I think that if we go down to the core of myself improving as a leader and continuing to try and improve as a leader,

1696
01:14:39.80 --> 01:14:47.80
it's because if you can detach and see yourself because that's the same exact thing like, I mentioned this earlier,

1697
01:14:47.80 --> 01:14:52.80
I said, you know, I kind of saw myself and saw how other guys were seeing me. Well, that you've got to detach for,

1698
01:14:52.80 --> 01:14:58.80
in order to see how other people are seeing you, you've got to be able to detach a little bit and understand it.

1699
01:14:58.80 --> 01:15:08.80
And so that ability to step back and see myself from other people's to see myself in situations and see how.

1700
01:15:08.80 --> 01:15:19.80
Other people were interacting with me was very, very helpful. Now, this does not mean that I was able to just correct course overnight and I don't want to make that, you know,

1701
01:15:19.80 --> 01:15:24.80
anyone think that. And I did dumb stuff when I was a, when I was a assistant,

1702
01:15:24.80 --> 01:15:38.80
assistant, but to him commander and I did dumb stuff when I was a student and I did dumb stuff when I was a tasking commander and I did dumb stuff when I was a training commander and I do, I'm going to do something dumb tomorrow, watch me.

1703
01:15:38.80 --> 01:15:43.80
But I think I will recognize it most of the time I look at it and say, you know what that was done.

1704
01:15:43.80 --> 01:15:48.76
do that again or here's how you can avoid it and I think that's what will help people. If people

1705
01:15:48.76 --> 01:15:57.40
can can adapt that little skill of stepping back off the line and taking a look around,

1706
01:15:57.40 --> 01:16:03.48
taking a look at yourself, look at how you're being perceived, what else is important is how

1707
01:16:04.52 --> 01:16:09.24
to actually think about how echo is perceiving me, right? Because if I'm in my own head, I can't,

1708
01:16:09.24 --> 01:16:13.80
I can never see how you're seeing me, but sometimes if you're acting, look the first thing I do

1709
01:16:13.80 --> 01:16:17.64
and someone's acting weird to me or I don't understand why someone's acting a certain way,

1710
01:16:17.64 --> 01:16:22.20
as I put myself in their shoes. It's hard to do that and if you don't do that,

1711
01:16:23.40 --> 01:16:29.88
you don't make real, you can't understand them. So if my boss is doing something crazy to me,

1712
01:16:29.88 --> 01:16:33.72
and all I do is get pitted them for doing something crazy, that's what we've just created

1713
01:16:33.72 --> 01:16:37.80
an antagonistic relationship and now things are going sideways and it's not good. If my boss is doing

1714
01:16:37.80 --> 01:16:40.84
something crazy, I mean I say, wait a second, why is he doing this? Let me think about what he's saying.

1715
01:16:41.96 --> 01:16:49.32
Oh, he's seeing Jocco, the caveman looking guy that wants to go out and he seems crazy. And okay,

1716
01:16:49.32 --> 01:16:54.52
I need to, I need to correct that. I need to correct that thing. I need to let him see that I'm

1717
01:16:54.52 --> 01:16:58.44
thinking about the big picture of that. I understand this, right? Okay, let me make those adjustments.

1718
01:16:59.16 --> 01:17:04.36
As opposed to he's stupid, he doesn't pitted. Screw him. No, detach.

1719
01:17:04.36 --> 01:17:11.40
Check other people's perspectives. Yeah, and that's a big key right there where you were like,

1720
01:17:11.40 --> 01:17:18.28
you said, you know, the the moment you kind of maybe realized the importance of the significance

1721
01:17:18.28 --> 01:17:25.08
of detaching, the oil rig campaign and then campaign was a training on. So it's not that

1722
01:17:25.08 --> 01:17:32.36
big of a deal to me that's a campaign. And then how you understood at whatever point that

1723
01:17:32.36 --> 01:17:41.000
that applies to life. Because I, man, that's, I'd say those two things. Understanding that

1724
01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:46.52
you don't know everything and being able to detach, which is borderline impossible, by the way,

1725
01:17:47.56 --> 01:17:53.000
most of your challenges. Yeah. And as far as applying it to like, like, because even in the military,

1726
01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:58.36
it's like, that's a very specific environment, military, like, unlike most environments

1727
01:17:58.36 --> 01:18:04.92
seemingly. Like, if you come, you know, like, I was talking about like, why don't I go into the post office,

1728
01:18:04.92 --> 01:18:08.76
or go into the grocery store dealing with my wife or something like that. But like, when you go

1729
01:18:08.76 --> 01:18:13.80
deep enough, detaching is going to serve the exact same significance. Good and all. So you're

1730
01:18:13.80 --> 01:18:21.32
way, you know, your wife comes home, you know, pissed because I don't know whatever, you know,

1731
01:18:21.32 --> 01:18:28.76
how you said the first reaction, what you feel like doing, which you, not you, but which one may typically

1732
01:18:28.76 --> 01:18:33.56
do is react accordingly, according to how I feel about this, what you're saying to me, you shouldn't

1733
01:18:33.56 --> 01:18:38.60
be saying this stuff to me. I didn't do anything to you. Why are you doing this to me? You know,

1734
01:18:38.60 --> 01:18:44.84
they're only dishes or whatever escalate escalate escalate escalate escalate escalate escalate. That's

1735
01:18:44.84 --> 01:18:48.92
what's happening. Yeah, that's all that's all what you're thinking. You're just thinking, hey,

1736
01:18:48.92 --> 01:18:52.76
this isn't fair. This is wrong what you're doing to me. So I'm going to, you know, express that or

1737
01:18:52.76 --> 01:18:59.48
whatever. But that's because you're not detached. Like you just did. And when you're able to do it,

1738
01:18:59.48 --> 01:19:05.32
again, borderline impossible. But do you find a borderline impossible? Have you made progress in that arena?

1739
01:19:05.32 --> 01:19:09.56
But hugely, no, here's, here's why it's not borderline impossible. It's not, that's an expression.

1740
01:19:09.56 --> 01:19:15.40
Okay, it's, it's, it can be impossible. It's borderline impossible because that's the last thing

1741
01:19:15.40 --> 01:19:20.68
you feel like doing. Yeah. So if you operate in your life, we do natural, by the way, with how you

1742
01:19:20.68 --> 01:19:24.92
feel, you know, like I'm just going to express myself. You know what it's like? It's like this.

1743
01:19:28.28 --> 01:19:33.24
It's like you're doing something. And you have to do something completely different. Yeah,

1744
01:19:33.24 --> 01:19:37.72
right? Just imagine that you're walking down the road. And now all of a sudden, you're walking

1745
01:19:37.72 --> 01:19:42.36
down the road. Maybe you're even jogging. You're jogging down the road. Now all of a sudden in a split

1746
01:19:42.36 --> 01:19:49.08
second, you've got to like go read a book. Like right at that moment in time while you're running,

1747
01:19:49.08 --> 01:19:53.88
it's like that radical of the change. Like it's something totally, that's what it feels like. When you

1748
01:19:53.88 --> 01:19:58.92
detach from the current situation, you're in this, you're in this thing, you're in this thing.

1749
01:19:58.92 --> 01:20:03.32
And you have to completely go and do something completely different. That's what it feels like. That

1750
01:20:03.32 --> 01:20:07.96
radical of a thing when you, when you really do it, when you do it, like when you're in a,

1751
01:20:07.96 --> 01:20:13.64
you know, let's say an argument with someone. He did a heated argument. It feels like you're going

1752
01:20:13.64 --> 01:20:21.32
from running a thousand miles an hour to, to like putting your face in the snow and reciting

1753
01:20:21.32 --> 01:20:27.56
the alphabet backwards. Like that's totally different. Yeah. And so that's why people are going

1754
01:20:27.56 --> 01:20:31.40
to ask, and they've asked us before, well, how do you do catch? And the, well, the biggest thing I

1755
01:20:31.40 --> 01:20:35.08
think you have to do is you have to figure out what your red flags are, what are the things that

1756
01:20:35.08 --> 01:20:40.60
show you that you're too engulfed in the situation and then recognize those things and then

1757
01:20:40.60 --> 01:20:43.64
go put your face in the snow and start reciting the alphabet backwards. Because that's what it

1758
01:20:43.64 --> 01:20:48.92
feels like to detach. Yeah. But if you think about the advance that you have, and I know you're

1759
01:20:48.92 --> 01:20:54.52
a football player, I'm not, but you know, you can watch everybody that's watching the football game on TV,

1760
01:20:54.52 --> 01:20:58.84
you can see every mistake that's being made as it's happening and everyone else on the field is

1761
01:20:58.84 --> 01:21:02.92
they're trying to, they can't compensate for him. Yeah. So they're in the game. Yeah,

1762
01:21:02.92 --> 01:21:06.20
and usually it's on the quarterback by the way, when the tech I was why I don't pin wedding

1763
01:21:06.20 --> 01:21:11.56
without the tech. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. Exactly. 100%. So you have that advantage if you can do that.

1764
01:21:11.56 --> 01:21:16.20
Yeah. If you can manage to do that in like another cool thing about the situation,

1765
01:21:16.20 --> 01:21:21.40
yes. I say borderline impossible, but the more you can actually pull through and do it, the more you

1766
01:21:21.40 --> 01:21:26.52
can do that, the easier it becomes. And when it becomes like habit, and really all it is,

1767
01:21:26.52 --> 01:21:31.56
and you can do weird like met up with, which I'm kind of a fan of doing little metaphors with

1768
01:21:31.56 --> 01:21:39.64
yourself, you know. So if it's like, you ever watch those movies? No. Where the movie's going on,

1769
01:21:39.64 --> 01:21:45.16
and then the person, what you call them, the protagonist, like it's almost like he pauses the movie,

1770
01:21:45.16 --> 01:21:50.52
and everyone in the movie pauses exactly. And then he starts to explain. Yeah. So yeah. So it's like you

1771
01:21:50.52 --> 01:21:55.64
do that to yourself. So you yourself is out. And so you go boom, wife comes home, pissed, you didn't,

1772
01:21:55.64 --> 01:21:59.24
I don't know, clean up the dogs, whatever, or I don't know, whatever. You didn't move along. How

1773
01:21:59.24 --> 01:22:05.40
about that. She's pissed. You can easily move along tonight. You can easily move along tomorrow,

1774
01:22:05.40 --> 01:22:09.000
whenever, right, but she's pissed, right? You don't think so. So what you do is right when you feel

1775
01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:13.64
yourself or right when you get hurt, yelling at you, boom, pause the movie. What do we have here? What

1776
01:22:13.64 --> 01:22:21.40
do we have here? We have myself, wife, she's mad at something, doesn't make sense. What would make,

1777
01:22:21.40 --> 01:22:25.08
you know, it's like, then you just detach it. That's what you know, they've been making sense. Yeah.

1778
01:22:25.08 --> 01:22:29.24
How are we going to solve the problem? You can easily make sense to this area. Like, you know,

1779
01:22:29.24 --> 01:22:34.44
you said like the full bugging. When you, if you can pause the movie at that point, step back,

1780
01:22:34.44 --> 01:22:40.12
you will easily make sense. Because you're like, oh, guess what? My wife, I haven't been home for

1781
01:22:40.12 --> 01:22:46.60
four days. Yeah. I left a bunch of laundry out. Yeah. The baby was diaper was dirty and I forgot to

1782
01:22:46.60 --> 01:22:50.92
throw it away. I'm, I'm okay. I see where she's not mad about the lawn specifically. There's

1783
01:22:50.92 --> 01:22:55.80
a bunch of things I did wrong. And she said, hey, you know what, I totally should have moved one and

1784
01:22:55.80 --> 01:23:01.72
by the way, the diapers. That was that was completely out of hand. You know what I mean? And you

1785
01:23:01.72 --> 01:23:05.72
diffuse and you de-escalate the situation. You're detached. That's how you roll. Yeah. That's how you

1786
01:23:05.72 --> 01:23:13.80
make it through it. Here's a little side tip on that situation along the diapers or whatever.

1787
01:23:13.80 --> 01:23:20.84
It's not that the grass is long and she wants it short and the fact that it's long is making

1788
01:23:20.84 --> 01:23:25.56
her met. That's not the situation. The situation is she said something. She thought that that

1789
01:23:25.56 --> 01:23:30.04
meant something that she said something. She thought it meant something to you. When it came

1790
01:23:30.04 --> 01:23:35.64
time to prove whether or not that meant something to you, you proved it didn't. That's what you're

1791
01:23:35.64 --> 01:23:38.84
dealing with. That's what you guys are dealing with. And that's easy to figure out when you

1792
01:23:38.84 --> 01:23:42.52
detach. That's what I figured out. Yeah. That's what I figured out when you're in the

1793
01:23:42.52 --> 01:23:47.64
game. It's hard to see who's open and who's not some of the time. Most of the time.

1794
01:23:47.64 --> 01:23:53.32
For sure. All the time. You might kiss. All right. Next question. Next question. I think this

1795
01:23:53.32 --> 01:23:58.04
question is a good lead. That last answer was a good lead into this next question. Yeah.

1796
01:23:59.88 --> 01:24:05.56
How do you think young jockel would have performed under commander willing?

1797
01:24:05.56 --> 01:24:11.88
All young jockel under old jockel. Yeah. You see that reaction that you just had is what I expected

1798
01:24:12.60 --> 01:24:17.48
because it seems like it should be like a really interesting question. Like a really interesting

1799
01:24:17.48 --> 01:24:22.76
answer, but it actually isn't that interesting to be quite honest with you. If young jockel

1800
01:24:22.76 --> 01:24:29.96
was working for old jockel, it would have been good to go. I would have liked me as a young guy. And

1801
01:24:29.96 --> 01:24:34.76
as a young guy would have liked me as a boss. I was a young hard worker with a good attitude.

1802
01:24:34.76 --> 01:24:39.48
And sometimes I got a little bit wild as I mentioned a little bit earlier. But I could have been

1803
01:24:39.48 --> 01:24:49.72
tightened up by the right leader. And I wasn't like I wasn't I wasn't it wasn't ever interfering

1804
01:24:49.72 --> 01:24:55.88
with work and all your wild. Yeah, my wild my wildness. You know, we're getting wild. We were young

1805
01:24:55.88 --> 01:25:02.28
young guys with a fist full of money and just being young guys in the game. So we're just getting

1806
01:25:02.28 --> 01:25:09.48
after it. And you know, guys, but we weren't like causing major trouble. Right? We weren't getting

1807
01:25:09.48 --> 01:25:13.96
arrested much. Yeah. We weren't getting in fights all the time. You know, we were causing some

1808
01:25:13.96 --> 01:25:18.28
problems. But it wasn't nothing major. So we'd have been tightened up and we got tightened up

1809
01:25:18.28 --> 01:25:28.12
sometimes. But it would have been no factor. And as a young guy, I think I would have

1810
01:25:28.12 --> 01:25:32.12
liked working for me because I would have looked at myself and been like, oh, that guy's fired up.

1811
01:25:32.12 --> 01:25:37.32
He was good after it. And that would have been cool with me. So again, I don't think it's like

1812
01:25:38.84 --> 01:25:42.84
it sounds like a really interesting question. But it's not really that interesting. And the cool

1813
01:25:42.84 --> 01:25:48.12
thing is there's a lot of young team guys that are like, but I was a young team guy. Yeah.

1814
01:25:48.12 --> 01:25:52.76
It's hard. So I was like, I was looking all the young team guys like, I remember when I was like that.

1815
01:25:52.76 --> 01:25:58.12
Good for him. Yeah. Hey, good for him. He's fired up. Would there be any issues though? You know,

1816
01:25:58.12 --> 01:26:04.28
like, what, as young Jockel, who do you think or not who, but what do you think would be your major

1817
01:26:04.28 --> 01:26:14.44
struggle? You know, any even? With my Jockel the boss? Yeah. Yeah. No, no, we would have been cool.

1818
01:26:15.72 --> 01:26:22.36
We'd been cool. Yeah. And the fact of the matter is, I mean, like 95% of the

1819
01:26:22.36 --> 01:26:28.12
young buck team guys that worked for me. Yeah. But I love those guys. You know, they were awesome.

1820
01:26:28.12 --> 01:26:32.60
And no issues. Yeah. So you're, you were like, you're essentially on the path then, really,

1821
01:26:32.60 --> 01:26:36.76
you know, with some loose ends for sure. Oh, yeah. From the loose ends for sure. Yeah. It was on the path.

1822
01:26:36.76 --> 01:26:42.28
Yeah. And in, you know, my, my, the guys that I went to buzz with that showed up at

1823
01:26:42.28 --> 01:26:46.76
Chulti-One, broke the drain. Well, that was, all Jockel would have loved off the last

1824
01:26:46.76 --> 01:26:50.76
guys. They were all fired up. I was nothing special. I'm not trying to say I was special.

1825
01:26:50.76 --> 01:26:54.44
Because I wasn't. There was guys that were way better than me. And, you know, that's to go

1826
01:26:54.44 --> 01:26:58.52
back to your questionnaire. When I described myself like as my good quality being durable,

1827
01:26:59.56 --> 01:27:03.40
the reason I say that is because like, there's guys that were better at me than that just about everything.

1828
01:27:03.40 --> 01:27:09.80
Like, faster than me, stronger than me, better shots than me, whatever. I was pretty durable, though.

1829
01:27:09.80 --> 01:27:14.04
Like, I was pretty, I was good at being average at a lot of different things. I was a strong

1830
01:27:14.04 --> 01:27:18.36
average in a lot of different things, which is good. And I was durable. Like, I could, I could take

1831
01:27:18.36 --> 01:27:24.28
some abuse, mental and physical abuse, which is a cool quality to have, you know? Yeah, very much.

1832
01:27:24.28 --> 01:27:28.60
So, like a tank that just can't, you know, yeah. And again, I'm not trying to, I'm no super

1833
01:27:28.60 --> 01:27:35.08
man, but I'm durable. You know, that makes sense. You know, you know, like the Toyota high

1834
01:27:35.08 --> 01:27:41.16
looks, you know, the Toyota high looks is. Anyways, it's a Toyota truck. They have them overseas.

1835
01:27:41.16 --> 01:27:47.96
They're diesel. And they're really, really durable. Really, there's a, there's a show

1836
01:27:47.96 --> 01:27:52.36
from England, my wife from England. There's a show in England. It's called Top Gear.

1837
01:27:52.36 --> 01:27:57.48
My son watches the show Top Gear. They tried to destroy a Toyota high looks.

1838
01:27:57.48 --> 01:28:02.20
Yeah. They were doing like, it just crazy things to it. It's a really durable.

1839
01:28:02.20 --> 01:28:06.44
It's not the fastest. It's not the strongest. You know, but it's durable.

1840
01:28:06.44 --> 01:28:10.52
Turbles are good quality to have. I got to ask the other day, you're so sorry.

1841
01:28:10.52 --> 01:28:16.44
You should do Olympic lifting. I'm like, bro, I'm not even in the mall park to, you know, compete with

1842
01:28:16.44 --> 01:28:20.68
Olympic. We'll be just crazy talk. Crazy talk. I'm sorry.

1843
01:28:20.68 --> 01:28:23.80
Yeah. That's anything that you start competing. You better. Yeah.

1844
01:28:23.80 --> 01:28:29.88
Yeah. Yeah. Crazy talk. Check. So yeah, young young, young,

1845
01:28:29.88 --> 01:28:34.28
buck, juggle. He would have a good time and old juggle. Like I said, man, there's,

1846
01:28:35.16 --> 01:28:40.76
there's a ton of young team guys that fired up. I was out with some young team. I was out

1847
01:28:40.76 --> 01:28:45.32
at with some team guys. And there was some young team guys there and some of these young

1848
01:28:45.32 --> 01:28:51.48
team guys fired up. Awesome. And like, yeah, you know what, you know, people say like,

1849
01:28:51.48 --> 01:28:54.84
oh, millennials and this and then we, you know, America's getting weak. I'm like,

1850
01:28:54.84 --> 01:28:58.44
I'm going to go hang out with some of those guys. They're 20 years old. I'm like, you know what,

1851
01:28:58.44 --> 01:29:04.68
we're going to go. Yeah. We're good to go. We got some guys that are beasts. Solid. Yeah.

1852
01:29:05.72 --> 01:29:11.000
Beyond solid. Freaking awesome. Yeah. My, my two friends that are in the

1853
01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:17.32
German, in the UK, not to think, talking to them now, like the maturity level is just really,

1854
01:29:17.32 --> 01:29:22.36
like really impressive maturity level, especially for both of them. But at the same time,

1855
01:29:22.36 --> 01:29:26.20
thinking back on them and how they kind of when they started when they're like,

1856
01:29:26.20 --> 01:29:30.36
we're going to the seal teams, all this stuff, considering that and then considering where they

1857
01:29:30.36 --> 01:29:37.32
are now, it makes it seem the same to me where older them wouldn't have a problem with them.

1858
01:29:37.32 --> 01:29:41.72
They say they run the path for sure. Those are kind of guys I'm talking about. Like those guys,

1859
01:29:41.72 --> 01:29:46.60
well, I would love that. Those guys working for me when I was a, when I was a commander and I would

1860
01:29:46.60 --> 01:29:51.08
love to have those guys as my chief when I was a young guy. Yeah. No, no factor. Yeah.

1861
01:29:52.04 --> 01:29:55.72
So like I said, I think people thought that sounded like an interest question, but you actually

1862
01:29:55.72 --> 01:29:59.56
wasn't. Yeah. Fortunately. Like you're building on these violations. Yeah. Yeah.

1863
01:29:59.56 --> 01:30:04.12
I got easy. Crazy. That was, it's crazy stuff. What about social,

1864
01:30:04.12 --> 01:30:08.04
lethal? Not socially, but what do you say? Like you're like outside of the military, you know?

1865
01:30:08.84 --> 01:30:13.08
Yeah, but I mean, I was a young kid. Yeah, but the end has an older guy. You're saying you look at

1866
01:30:13.08 --> 01:30:17.24
the young kids and you go, yeah, you know, he's young. Yeah. He's getting after it. God bless him.

1867
01:30:17.24 --> 01:30:21.24
Bless rock and roll. I got to let me keep him out of trouble. Yeah. That's all good.

1868
01:30:22.76 --> 01:30:25.24
All good. I think I might have some problems with myself.

1869
01:30:26.60 --> 01:30:32.68
Young echo. Oh, because young echo wasn't on the path yet. No, no, yeah. There was no path. I didn't even

1870
01:30:32.68 --> 01:30:43.32
see a path. Really? I don't know. Maybe. All right. Next question. What advice would Jockel give his 17

1871
01:30:43.32 --> 01:30:51.08
year old self regarding school, social relationships, parents, peer pressure, etc. Yes. This is like the

1872
01:30:51.08 --> 01:30:55.16
actual Jockel podcast tonight. Is he? He's a guy. He's a question to her about Jockel. Yeah. Actually,

1873
01:30:55.16 --> 01:30:59.40
that's kind of what I was asking like outside of the military. Yeah. You know, if I was going to tell

1874
01:30:59.40 --> 01:31:03.08
myself something here's a couple things that you know, I would tell myself to do that. I tell

1875
01:31:03.08 --> 01:31:11.08
to tell myself to learn that. I would tell myself that that girl isn't the whole world. Yeah. And those

1876
01:31:11.08 --> 01:31:14.52
friends are the last friend you're ever going to have and the party isn't going to be the best

1877
01:31:14.52 --> 01:31:19.08
party of all time and all those things that you think is what we talked about earlier. All those

1878
01:31:19.08 --> 01:31:23.88
things that you think are a huge deal when you're young. They're not a big deal. And I know that's

1879
01:31:23.88 --> 01:31:29.000
kind of messed up, but it's true, man. It's true. The things that you think are a big deal when you're

1880
01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:35.96
17 years old or not that big of a deal. And it's really hard to convince someone that 17 years old

1881
01:31:35.96 --> 01:31:43.32
of that. Right. They also also what they don't recognize is things that are a big deal.

1882
01:31:43.88 --> 01:31:48.60
They don't recognize. They think they're a little deal. Right. So they're doing stupid things, right?

1883
01:31:49.24 --> 01:31:55.000
Whether it's drinking and driving, whether I mean kids still drink and drive now. Like,

1884
01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:59.80
yeah, how dumb is that? Yeah. Seems great. And just so people don't think, you know,

1885
01:31:59.80 --> 01:32:03.64
nowadays we've talked about social media already, but people post stuff on social media and you

1886
01:32:03.64 --> 01:32:09.64
come and what is wrong with you? And I guess, you know, I've heard now and we work with a lot of

1887
01:32:09.64 --> 01:32:13.72
different companies when you apply for a job, they go and look at your social media and see what kind

1888
01:32:13.72 --> 01:32:19.24
of an idiot you might be. That's a good move. Oh, it's a great move. It's a great move. So

1889
01:32:19.24 --> 01:32:25.64
yeah, just just recognize that some of the little things are actually big and some of the

1890
01:32:25.64 --> 01:32:30.92
big things are actually little and I'd square those things away. And the answer said this before,

1891
01:32:30.92 --> 01:32:37.32
when you're young, you've got to realize that how you act now is directly related to your future

1892
01:32:37.32 --> 01:32:43.72
success, to your future happiness, to your future financial situation, to everything. So it's hard

1893
01:32:43.72 --> 01:32:49.64
to make that connection, right? We're young. Impossible. It might be impossible. Some kids get it, though.

1894
01:32:49.64 --> 01:32:55.000
I'm telling you, some kids get it. I think they're just, no, some kids get it. Some of my oldest

1895
01:32:55.000 --> 01:33:02.76
daughters, friends, they get it. Like, they're on track. They're on track. They're like, hey, I'm doing this.

1896
01:33:02.76 --> 01:33:07.88
I'm doing that. They're on track. They're 16 years old. They're studying for the SATs. They're taking the

1897
01:33:07.88 --> 01:33:15.88
AP classes. My daughter included. They're on track to make stuff happen. Yeah. But I think, and I'm

1898
01:33:15.88 --> 01:33:20.68
not saying this is the case, but this is probably the case. When we're in another,

1899
01:33:21.32 --> 01:33:26.60
that could be wrong. But okay, so we talked about this before, even the part of your brain that

1900
01:33:26.60 --> 01:33:31.08
understands all that they're talking about. Yeah, it's an air developed. So this is, you know,

1901
01:33:31.08 --> 01:33:36.28
this is from what I understand how you kind of influence people. You just put them on a routine.

1902
01:33:36.28 --> 01:33:41.08
Kind of like, okay, so it's the difference between understanding like what I'm doing now and having

1903
01:33:41.08 --> 01:33:47.000
it tangible. No, I'm telling you. I know where you're going with this. And you're, I believe that

1904
01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:50.20
there are definitely some kids like that that are just, they're just like, hey, okay, I'm supposed to

1905
01:33:50.20 --> 01:33:53.72
get good grades, many of your grades, and I'm supposed to get a big deal on that track. I know for

1906
01:33:53.72 --> 01:33:59.000
a fact kids that are like, no, I am going to do this, this, this, and it's going to lead me here.

1907
01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:02.36
Actually, you know what, you're right, because this is a Blake. You know, remember Blake,

1908
01:34:02.36 --> 01:34:08.20
you see the videos for? Yeah. So he, we did like a thing where I think it's like a Q&A or something,

1909
01:34:08.20 --> 01:34:13.64
something like that, and he was, he was talking about that, where in elementary school, he remembers

1910
01:34:13.64 --> 01:34:22.12
feeling like if I don't have perfect attendance and have perfect straight days, I won't pass this,

1911
01:34:22.12 --> 01:34:27.56
not pass, but I won't like be the perfect guy or whatever, and he said that he would, um,

1912
01:34:27.56 --> 01:34:31.88
it would like create like this track to his whole future and his life would be ruined.

1913
01:34:31.88 --> 01:34:35.56
Yeah. That's how he felt. How's it? Whoa. Oh, I'm living like,

1914
01:34:35.56 --> 01:34:41.32
literally minute to minute and third grade. It would be like the reason I wanted to do my

1915
01:34:41.32 --> 01:34:46.04
homework and get good grades is so I wouldn't get in trouble straight up. It was not to get into

1916
01:34:46.04 --> 01:34:51.80
college, it was for sure. None of that stuff. For sure. And then that's the way most kids are. In my

1917
01:34:51.80 --> 01:34:56.60
opinion, most kids are, hey, I don't want to get in trouble. Some immediate repercussions myself included.

1918
01:34:56.60 --> 01:35:01.24
Yeah. Hey, I got to pass this so I can go to the next grade. Yeah. All in a

1919
01:35:01.24 --> 01:35:04.84
mean stuff. Yeah. Or I don't want to be the guy in class who didn't do his homework. You know,

1920
01:35:04.84 --> 01:35:11.24
kind of thing. Yeah. It was like it was all I ever felt that way. Yeah. But yeah, I guess so. Yeah,

1921
01:35:11.24 --> 01:35:17.32
I guess so. That's me trying to, I got to step out to myself on that one. And I guess the final thing.

1922
01:35:17.32 --> 01:35:21.72
Obviously, I tell myself, this is funny. It was for you to, which is basically what we're saying.

1923
01:35:21.72 --> 01:35:28.36
Yeah. So get this one, you know, you live your life. Yeah. That pen that, I think the biggest one

1924
01:35:28.36 --> 01:35:35.48
there is to, to whether they totally understand that or not, say like, what you're doing right right now is

1925
01:35:36.92 --> 01:35:39.96
the important things in life, the things that you think are important are not important.

1926
01:35:39.96 --> 01:35:43.32
Are not important. And then things that aren't that you think are not important,

1927
01:35:43.32 --> 01:35:47.64
important are important. So it's kind of like a iceberg, you know, the old people,

1928
01:35:47.64 --> 01:35:51.48
people, I don't know, lots over that little statement. You know, I guess people really like the way you say

1929
01:35:51.48 --> 01:35:58.68
important. You just said eight times. Oh, yeah. Well, it's a flurry of glory and rainbows.

1930
01:35:58.68 --> 01:36:03.72
emojis. Yeah. Well, hey, yes. I agree with you. So like the iceberg thing, you know,

1931
01:36:03.72 --> 01:36:06.76
you know, the iceberg metaphor where it's like people only see the top of iceberg could be

1932
01:36:06.76 --> 01:36:11.64
low that is like this huge iceberg. So that's what that's what important things are in life.

1933
01:36:11.64 --> 01:36:15.80
Right. So you think it's just this little small little iceberg, but when you think of the whole

1934
01:36:15.80 --> 01:36:21.32
scope of life, which you have no access to by the way, as a kid, it's that whole iceberg. You know,

1935
01:36:21.32 --> 01:36:25.64
so if you're not focusing on that important part of the iceberg, well, I guess,

1936
01:36:25.64 --> 01:36:29.96
an iceberg situation is not that important, but you can come another metaphor, but it'll sink your

1937
01:36:29.96 --> 01:36:35.56
ship. Yeah. Yeah. You know, like in that kind of situation, but and then at the same time,

1938
01:36:35.56 --> 01:36:39.16
the things that aren't really important, meaning they don't have an iceberg under there. They're

1939
01:36:39.16 --> 01:36:43.16
just little floaty things. You think that's so important. Nothing's in a melted get cut over

1940
01:36:43.16 --> 01:36:47.64
whatever, you know, not going to sink you. No, it's not going to sink you. It's just kind of it's

1941
01:36:47.64 --> 01:36:55.56
fleeting. Check. A one thing before we closed out tonight, because I think that's good for questions.

1942
01:36:56.28 --> 01:37:00.60
I want to hit a couple, 10 verses new book. I want to hit a couple quick things from it.

1943
01:37:01.48 --> 01:37:08.36
Tribe of Mentors is what it's called. And it was a lot of good info in it. And it's written in

1944
01:37:08.36 --> 01:37:11.72
really short little sections. If you didn't know this yet, I mean, you can read them in like five

1945
01:37:11.72 --> 01:37:18.52
or ten minutes. And then what he did in this book is he took and asked the same, I think it's 10 or 11

1946
01:37:18.52 --> 01:37:24.28
questions to all these different, I would say random, but they're not random because they're all kind of

1947
01:37:26.60 --> 01:37:33.24
successful in whatever realm they're going to be successful. And because I guess successful is a very

1948
01:37:34.44 --> 01:37:39.40
open turn, right? Whatever realm they're in, there's successful with all kinds of people in here.

1949
01:37:39.40 --> 01:37:45.96
And I just, I read like the first couple, 150 pages or so, and I just want to do pull out a couple

1950
01:37:45.96 --> 01:37:52.60
of the couple ones that I thought were pretty cool. That I thought people could take a little

1951
01:37:52.60 --> 01:37:57.16
something away from. And I was like 10, can I read a couple of these things? He said, yeah, go ahead.

1952
01:37:58.76 --> 01:38:08.84
Whatever. Hopefully it doesn't sue me. Anyways, so here we go. The first one is a little

1953
01:38:08.84 --> 01:38:15.48
section from some excerpts and I'm not reading the whole like everything in each person's section,

1954
01:38:15.48 --> 01:38:21.64
but just some of the highlights. Stephen Presfield, the guys in author, he's in Marine Corps.

1955
01:38:21.64 --> 01:38:27.08
You know who Stephen Presfield is? Yeah, he wrote the art of war. He wrote the legend of

1956
01:38:27.08 --> 01:38:32.68
bagger vans. That's a war of art. Yes, he wrote the war of art. Yeah, which is obviously a play on

1957
01:38:32.68 --> 01:38:39.24
words for the art of war. And the war of art is like how to be creative and how to overcome those things

1958
01:38:39.24 --> 01:38:44.60
and overcome the resistance and all that. Joe Rogan actually told me he used to have a stack of those

1959
01:38:44.60 --> 01:38:48.20
books and he just gave them the people who came to meet him. Yeah, that's why I read it.

1960
01:38:49.08 --> 01:38:56.28
Joe Rogan. Oh, there you go. And he also wrote Gates of Fire, which is a freaking awesome book,

1961
01:38:56.28 --> 01:39:04.68
actually, and it's about the Spartans, the Battle of Thermopoli. And they actually teach Gates of Fire

1962
01:39:05.24 --> 01:39:10.52
like at the basics of the Marine Corps and at the Naval Academy, at least I've heard that they've

1963
01:39:10.52 --> 01:39:18.36
teach it. So that's pretty, that's pretty awesome. Anyways, here's a question for Stephen Presfield.

1964
01:39:18.36 --> 01:39:23.08
The question is, what advice would you give to a smart driven college student about to enter the

1965
01:39:23.08 --> 01:39:29.40
real world? What advice should they ignore? Here's what he said, I'm probably hopelessly out of date,

1966
01:39:29.40 --> 01:39:36.12
but my advice is get real world experience. Be a cowboy, drive a truck, join the Marine Corps,

1967
01:39:36.84 --> 01:39:42.84
get out of the hyper competitive life hack frame of mind. I'm 74, believe me, you've got all the

1968
01:39:42.84 --> 01:39:46.84
time in the world. You've got 10 lifetimes ahead of you. Don't worry about your friends,

1969
01:39:46.84 --> 01:39:53.96
beating you or getting somewhere ahead of you, get out and get into the real dirt world and start

1970
01:39:53.96 --> 01:39:59.96
failing. Why do I say that? Because the goal is to connect with your own self, your own soul,

1971
01:40:00.84 --> 01:40:08.60
adversity. Everybody spends their life trying to avoid it. Me too, but the best things that

1972
01:40:08.60 --> 01:40:14.20
ever happened to me came during the times when the shit hit the fan and I had nothing and nobody to

1973
01:40:14.20 --> 01:40:22.60
help me. Who are you really? What do you really want? Get out there and fail and find out.

1974
01:40:24.20 --> 01:40:29.56
Very interesting. Pretty cool. What's funny? I was talking to Jake last night. Literally last night

1975
01:40:29.56 --> 01:40:36.60
told me the same thing. Get out there and fail? What part? That thing. It's like, you know,

1976
01:40:36.60 --> 01:40:42.68
live. So me when I step outside of my comfort zone, I take one tiny step. And here's the thing.

1977
01:40:42.68 --> 01:40:48.68
He told you to jump. He told me to, yeah, I take a bigger jump. He didn't tell me to do it. He just

1978
01:40:48.68 --> 01:40:54.12
recommended it. Because my whole, and this is probably half justification. By the way,

1979
01:40:55.000 --> 01:41:00.68
I have a comfort zone. I'll take one tiny step and then I'll take the, you know, when you step

1980
01:41:00.68 --> 01:41:04.68
outside, you can burn to whatever you get, you know, whatever and then you grow from it. That's what

1981
01:41:04.68 --> 01:41:10.44
it happens. That's the whole idea. So I take a tiny step. Then I take the tiny hit and then I get the

1982
01:41:10.44 --> 01:41:14.76
tiny growth. But I try to do it all the time all the time all the time. But it's still safe, man.

1983
01:41:14.76 --> 01:41:18.84
That's still safe. Because that's just like one pinky outside the comfort zone. That's what you've

1984
01:41:18.84 --> 01:41:24.68
seen. It was like you, like you get a step outside. Because just the fact that you can endure a big

1985
01:41:25.32 --> 01:41:30.44
fail, you know, you see, go out there and fail, right? It's best field. So if you can endure like a big

1986
01:41:30.44 --> 01:41:37.16
fail or two big fails or major fails, now you have the ability to endure major failure, you know,

1987
01:41:37.16 --> 01:41:41.56
you're kind of thinking. That's that's his whole thing. It's like, yeah, that makes sense. I didn't

1988
01:41:41.56 --> 01:41:49.96
tell him that at the time. It's like, oh, man, I'm doing it perfectly. Tiaq, next question for Steven

1989
01:41:49.96 --> 01:41:58.52
Pressfield, when you feel overwhelmed or unfocused, what do you do? Here's his answer. I have a

1990
01:41:58.52 --> 01:42:04.36
friend at the gym who knew Jack LaLaine. Google him if the name is unfamiliar. Jack used to say,

1991
01:42:04.36 --> 01:42:10.68
it's okay to take a day off from working out. But on that day, you're not allowed to eat.

1992
01:42:13.08 --> 01:42:17.48
That's the short way of saying you're not really allowed to get unfocused.

1993
01:42:18.36 --> 01:42:23.64
Take a vacation, gather yourself, but know that the only reason you're here on this planet is to

1994
01:42:23.64 --> 01:42:30.28
follow your star and do what the muse tells you. It's amazing how a good day's work will get you

1995
01:42:30.28 --> 01:42:37.96
right back to feeling like yourself. That's good info right there. When I realize this,

1996
01:42:41.48 --> 01:42:50.20
it's so easy to go down the downward spiral of Epad Food, feel bad, not get good workouts,

1997
01:42:50.20 --> 01:42:56.84
sleep, plate, sleep like crap. And then what do you do when you feel like crap?

1998
01:42:56.84 --> 01:43:05.88
You want to feel better as soon as possible so you do some immediate gratification. Right,

1999
01:43:05.88 --> 01:43:09.48
you go, you know what? I don't feel like working out so I'm not going to work out.

2000
01:43:10.60 --> 01:43:14.28
And then you say, you know what? I don't feel good. In reason you don't feel good,

2001
01:43:14.28 --> 01:43:17.08
is because you didn't work out. That's enough what you use you like well,

2002
01:43:17.08 --> 01:43:20.12
but you know what's going to make me feel better? Adonat, I'm going to be here,

2003
01:43:20.12 --> 01:43:25.64
then a beer, and say you get the donut in the beer. And then now you really don't feel like

2004
01:43:25.64 --> 01:43:31.80
working out. So that's the downward spiral. Break the spiral, break it, break what you call

2005
01:43:31.80 --> 01:43:36.36
in the other day when Jordan Peterson was on, break the loop. Right. So that's the same thing.

2006
01:43:36.36 --> 01:43:39.80
You got to break the loop and that's what he's talking about. When you're feeling like crap,

2007
01:43:40.44 --> 01:43:46.76
get after it. That's what that's how I translated. And it makes you feel better and it gets you

2008
01:43:46.76 --> 01:43:51.40
right back on the path. Yeah. And that's why actually fasting is a good thing. Yeah.

2009
01:43:51.40 --> 01:43:57.72
Fasting is a good way to get yourself re-acquainted with the path real quick. You feel your body

2010
01:43:57.72 --> 01:44:03.08
with a bunch of junk. Yeah. It makes you not want a performance, it makes you not want to work out,

2011
01:44:03.08 --> 01:44:10.20
it makes you not want to work when you're clean. You feel good. So hit a fast 24 hours.

2012
01:44:11.72 --> 01:44:16.84
You know, yeah, rock and roll. Yeah. And I like that. You want to take a day off. That's cool.

2013
01:44:16.84 --> 01:44:23.56
I think no eating. How legit is that? It's real legit. It's a real legit. Because now,

2014
01:44:23.56 --> 01:44:27.56
yes, what? At lunchtime, you're like, man, I just want to eat something cool. Go bang it.

2015
01:44:27.56 --> 01:44:33.16
Yeah, go workout. And then you can get your grub on. Or you can just work out and still not eat.

2016
01:44:37.16 --> 01:44:42.60
All right. Getting into the next cat here. This guy's name is

2017
01:44:42.60 --> 01:44:49.08
Jersey Gregorick. And this guy am a great football in the United States. It's a political refugee

2018
01:44:49.08 --> 01:44:58.28
with his wife in 1986. And he won subsequently won four world weight lifting championships

2019
01:44:58.28 --> 01:45:04.36
and established one world record record founded the UCLA weight lifting team. And by the way,

2020
01:45:04.36 --> 01:45:10.12
this guy's been on this guy's been on Tim's podcast as well. This guy, Jersey.

2021
01:45:10.12 --> 01:45:17.80
And also writer, write poem, wrote poems and had award winning poems. But this is kind of a cool

2022
01:45:17.80 --> 01:45:24.44
little statement that he wrote in here. He kind of goes on a little bit of a tangent. This isn't

2023
01:45:24.44 --> 01:45:28.68
related to the question, but I want to jump into it. He says five years ago, I decided to eliminate

2024
01:45:28.68 --> 01:45:35.80
my reactive behavior to irritations. But at first, none of my tricks worked. I placed philosophical

2025
01:45:35.80 --> 01:45:40.84
and inspirational quotes on my iPhone wallpaper and wrote my journal. But the Proverbs always

2026
01:45:40.84 --> 01:45:47.000
lost their effectiveness over time. Then one day, I told one of my clients who blamed her husband

2027
01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:55.32
for everything to take 100% responsibility for her part in the interactions. This way, I said,

2028
01:45:55.32 --> 01:46:00.12
you will be free of trying to control him and you will be able to find constructive solutions in

2029
01:46:00.12 --> 01:46:07.32
your relationship. When she left, I realized that the same advice could help me as well, taking 100%

2030
01:46:07.32 --> 01:46:12.52
personal responsibility would help me to stop blaming or complaining and achieve a sense of flow.

2031
01:46:13.24 --> 01:46:17.48
It would also give me the clarity in any conversation to locate the right words to help a person

2032
01:46:17.48 --> 01:46:23.16
accept a hard choice. So he's talking about extreme ownership. And we talk about that.

2033
01:46:23.16 --> 01:46:27.16
We're taking a taken extreme ownership in a relationship with another human being.

2034
01:46:27.16 --> 01:46:31.32
Don't blame them. Figure out how you're going to solve the problem yourself.

2035
01:46:31.32 --> 01:46:35.48
You know what this reminded me of was when Captain Plum was on and he was had a cellmate.

2036
01:46:36.28 --> 01:46:43.40
And what they, you remember Captain Plum and he touched on it. But he was saying that if their

2037
01:46:43.40 --> 01:46:48.44
cellmate was annoying them, because they're living with one other or two other or three other

2038
01:46:48.44 --> 01:46:56.28
people for months on end in a little freaking Hanoi Hilton cell. And he said, if that person

2039
01:46:56.28 --> 01:47:00.84
because you can imagine how you get on each other's nerves and they all took the ad to do it.

2040
01:47:00.84 --> 01:47:06.36
If they allowed themselves, if Echo was getting on my nerves, it wasn't Echo's fault. It was my fault.

2041
01:47:06.36 --> 01:47:12.20
Yeah, yeah. Mind fault. Yeah. And that's what he's talking about here. Then you can actually fix it.

2042
01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:20.60
The next question that Jersey answered is this one, if you could have a gigantic billboard anywhere

2043
01:47:20.60 --> 01:47:27.16
with anything on it, what would it say? And why? And here we go. Here's what his answer was. Hard choices,

2044
01:47:27.16 --> 01:47:33.56
easy life, easy choices, hard life. Nothing truly meaningful or lasting has ever been created in a

2045
01:47:33.56 --> 01:47:40.92
short period of time. If you learn the story behind any great success, you realize how many years

2046
01:47:40.92 --> 01:47:46.12
went by and how many hard choices were made to achieve it. Reaching for more is not only an

2047
01:47:46.12 --> 01:47:53.80
active ambition, it also comes from passion and love. Nothing is achieved because of easy choices.

2048
01:47:54.84 --> 01:48:02.04
I believe that people can endure any hardship if it is sensible and constructive. Hard choices

2049
01:48:02.04 --> 01:48:07.24
means never retiring because the brain has to be engaged in finding new solutions in the moment.

2050
01:48:07.24 --> 01:48:16.04
Not just remembering old formulas. Hard choices make us wiser, smarter, stronger, and well-being.

2051
01:48:16.04 --> 01:48:25.64
Well-theor and easy choices reverse our progress. Focusing our energies on comfort or entertainment.

2052
01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:32.92
In every difficult moment, ask yourself, what is a hard choice and what is an easy choice?

2053
01:48:32.92 --> 01:48:41.88
And you will know instantly what is right. Does that even need commentary?

2054
01:48:41.88 --> 01:48:51.88
Not really. That's a great thing to think about. Discipline equals freedom.

2055
01:48:51.88 --> 01:48:57.16
Discipline is hard, man. Yeah, you know how you say pain our palator kind of thing.

2056
01:48:57.16 --> 01:49:03.48
Yeah, you know. If you want to pay later or if you want to, a lot of people they try to pay later.

2057
01:49:03.48 --> 01:49:07.96
Yeah, well the best thing. So I heard it on the other day, you can either suffer the pain of

2058
01:49:07.96 --> 01:49:12.76
discipline or the pain of regret. Right, same thing, same thing. People say in the same thing.

2059
01:49:12.76 --> 01:49:17.40
Must mean something. Yeah. It must mean something. Pay attention to it. Yeah.

2060
01:49:19.88 --> 01:49:29.88
All right. Moving to the next section here, page 127 from Tribamentor's Amelia Boone.

2061
01:49:29.88 --> 01:49:41.24
And she wakes up at like three o'clock in the morning. She's legit. And she's four time world champion

2062
01:49:41.24 --> 01:49:47.32
in the sport of obstacle course racing. I met her a couple times. You met her too. Yeah.

2063
01:49:48.04 --> 01:49:57.32
She's a beast. And what's cool about her is she beats like she did the 2012 world's toughest

2064
01:49:57.32 --> 01:50:05.96
mother competition. It's 24 hours, 90 miles, 300 obstacles. She finished second overall

2065
01:50:07.48 --> 01:50:14.92
out of more than a thousand competitors, including 80% of which are male. Second overall.

2066
01:50:14.92 --> 01:50:21.88
Did I have to say some about being durable earlier? Yeah. That's durable. So Amelia

2067
01:50:21.88 --> 01:50:31.40
awesome human and a lot less one we'll do here. But she got to ask, no, same question.

2068
01:50:32.76 --> 01:50:36.76
If you could have a gigantic billboard anywhere with anything on it, what would you say and why?

2069
01:50:37.72 --> 01:50:46.92
And Amelia says, no one owes you anything. We live in a world that's rampant with entitlement,

2070
01:50:46.92 --> 01:50:53.08
with many people believing that they deserve to be given more. My parents raised me to be self-sufficient

2071
01:50:53.08 --> 01:50:57.72
and oppressed upon me that the only person you can really depend on in life is you.

2072
01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:05.64
If you want something you work for it. You don't expect it to be given. If others help you

2073
01:51:05.64 --> 01:51:12.28
long away, that's fantastic, but it's not a given. I believe that the key to self-sufficiency

2074
01:51:12.28 --> 01:51:19.96
is breaking free of the mindset that someone somewhere owes you something or will come to your rescue.

2075
01:51:25.56 --> 01:51:32.52
No one owes you anything. No one's coming to your rescue. It's on you. Obviously,

2076
01:51:32.52 --> 01:51:40.52
I couldn't agree more. That's funny because as she said, I mean, we know the importance of a team.

2077
01:51:42.36 --> 01:51:46.60
And you always hear people say, you know, you can't do it by yourself. And I'm not here.

2078
01:51:46.60 --> 01:51:52.04
I'm here because of so many different people. That's true. But that doesn't mean that you can

2079
01:51:52.04 --> 01:51:59.72
sit around and rely on other people to save you or to do the heavy lifting or even to help you out

2080
01:51:59.72 --> 01:52:10.76
in either way. Help from other people is a luxury. It's a luxury that you shouldn't count on.

2081
01:52:12.04 --> 01:52:21.40
So step up and open it and make it happen because no one owes you anything. That book is

2082
01:52:21.40 --> 01:52:31.96
tribal mentors Timothy Ferris. He's got Timothy. Not too many more. Timothy Ferris. Short life advice

2083
01:52:31.96 --> 01:52:41.16
from the best in the world. All right, speaking of helping people. Echo channels. Yeah. Maybe you

2084
01:52:41.16 --> 01:52:50.20
can help people learn how to support themselves. Yeah. And maybe if they want to also simultaneously

2085
01:52:50.20 --> 01:52:57.000
support this podcast if they want to. That that would be fantastic. But we're not relying on it.

2086
01:52:57.000 --> 01:53:02.68
Is that kind of the theme? I'm hoping. Yeah. I'm not. Hey, I got this. I'll run with it. Sure.

2087
01:53:04.28 --> 01:53:08.20
Oh, yeah, sure. Of course. Sure. You want me to run with it? No. Because I'll be done with it.

2088
01:53:08.20 --> 01:53:13.48
Four minutes. Right here. What's interesting is that kind of depend on you and rely on you to kind of

2089
01:53:13.48 --> 01:53:18.20
help bail me out this podcast. Otherwise, it'd just be kind of talking to myself. Okay.

2090
01:53:18.20 --> 01:53:23.48
Check. Actually, I wouldn't be talking because I typically talk after you talk like in reaction

2091
01:53:23.48 --> 01:53:29.08
to you. So if it was the Echo podcast, it would just be silence. Yeah. It wouldn't even be

2092
01:53:29.08 --> 01:53:36.84
good evening because you say good evening. You know. No podcast. Check. It's all good. So yeah,

2093
01:53:36.84 --> 01:53:41.88
support yourself. All right. We'll talk about acrylic oil. Jocco is acrylic oil. Jocco super

2094
01:53:41.88 --> 01:53:49.72
acrylic oil. Super. Super. Yeah. And also Jocco joint warfare. Lucas being enjoying this offer.

2095
01:53:49.72 --> 01:53:57.40
Your joints. The best type of supplement in my opinion. You know, when I have you been into other

2096
01:53:57.96 --> 01:54:04.04
supplements, not in the long time. Yeah. So I have like in my younger days where I take like,

2097
01:54:04.04 --> 01:54:12.20
I don't know protein powder. Like this thing that does this. You know, I can say with full on

2098
01:54:13.16 --> 01:54:19.96
honesty that when I stop taking it there, what happens when you stop taking it? That's the thing.

2099
01:54:19.96 --> 01:54:26.20
Yeah. So there is a difference. And especially, I mean, I don't know. I'm, I'm whatever,

2100
01:54:26.20 --> 01:54:32.12
A jam now. I don't have to go into that part. But so I don't know. I don't know how it is to take

2101
01:54:32.12 --> 01:54:36.44
acrylic oil when I was like in my 20s. So I don't know. You know, kind of think, but I know now.

2102
01:54:36.44 --> 01:54:41.88
And I'll tell you this and I have got nothing for like a, it was like maybe a week,

2103
01:54:41.88 --> 01:54:45.80
a little, little bit more than a week. And yeah, they could they came back, man.

2104
01:54:47.40 --> 01:54:51.16
The joint situation. Yes. You know what I think, you know what I think the acrylic oil and the

2105
01:54:51.16 --> 01:54:59.48
joint warfare do make you durable. Yeah. Thank you, dirt. I believe they contribute

2106
01:54:59.48 --> 01:55:04.04
evenly to my durability. Yeah. And that's, and it's actually saying a lot for me, because

2107
01:55:04.04 --> 01:55:09.16
and for you too, big time because you're, you're not like a small guy, you know, a small person.

2108
01:55:09.16 --> 01:55:13.88
And let's face it. We're older than we were before. It's a true statement.

2109
01:55:13.88 --> 01:55:20.52
We're older than we were before. And you, you, you, you, you actually more so than me, you do like

2110
01:55:20.52 --> 01:55:26.44
hard stuff. Yeah. Like lifting, jiu-jitsu, like hard stuff. Yeah.

2111
01:55:26.44 --> 01:55:32.60
Yeah. Harder than the normal person. Maybe some people, not a melee boom. Yeah.

2112
01:55:32.60 --> 01:55:37.80
She's out there. 90 $300. Yeah, she's out there. 90 miles.

2113
01:55:38.60 --> 01:55:43.88
Awesome. You got some. Yeah, see what up. She's not already on it or something like it.

2114
01:55:43.88 --> 01:55:49.64
Nonetheless, the joint situation is like that's saying a lot. If you can do the stuff that you do

2115
01:55:49.64 --> 01:55:56.12
and I, just kind of doing some intro spectrum kind of detaching, whatever. I'm looking

2116
01:55:56.12 --> 01:56:01.48
at the stuff that I do, it's like, man, it helps a lot. I don't think I would be able to go as hard.

2117
01:56:02.12 --> 01:56:07.16
Oh, no, you definitely wouldn't. Like just daily. My shoulder healed. Yeah. My elbow straight

2118
01:56:07.16 --> 01:56:12.76
up. Yeah. There you go. And my knees, I put a view so my knees with, with like working out.

2119
01:56:12.76 --> 01:56:18.76
And jiu-jitsu, because they're kind of loose. Skinny and skinny. I thought you were just there.

2120
01:56:18.76 --> 01:56:26.76
But like they're super loose, where when I blew out many in college, the doctor, when he, you know,

2121
01:56:26.76 --> 01:56:30.76
they do the tests, they're like, okay, before they do that, they do the tests. All these tests.

2122
01:56:30.76 --> 01:56:34.92
They just kind of wiggle them and do all this stuff from different positions. And they wiggle both of them.

2123
01:56:34.92 --> 01:56:39.88
And they're like, bro, your knees are loose. Like, this just geneticicity that they were skinny too.

2124
01:56:39.88 --> 01:56:49.32
Anyway, they were loose. And then, do you said you're skinny? I do. And skinny ankles.

2125
01:56:49.32 --> 01:56:57.000
Get up right now. Anyway, then I hurt my knee when I was one of the great. And I went to

2126
01:56:58.04 --> 01:57:02.20
the doctor who performed the surgeon by step. And he did. He was like, oh, yeah, you have a

2127
01:57:02.20 --> 01:57:09.32
blown AC up. And I was like, oh, who, I only have, I hurt the outside of my knee or the inside of my knee.

2128
01:57:09.32 --> 01:57:13.40
Not the outside or not my, I didn't blow out my knees. Like, no, you blew out your knee. I was like,

2129
01:57:13.40 --> 01:57:18.20
dang, that was like, oh, but he didn't run any comprehensive tests. He just did it real quick. Like,

2130
01:57:18.20 --> 01:57:22.92
we go that. And then I was like, whoa, my doctor in college said I have really loose knees. So check this one.

2131
01:57:22.92 --> 01:57:27.32
And there he had like another person there and he goes, um, and he checks the other thing. He was like, whoa,

2132
01:57:27.32 --> 01:57:35.72
whoa. But the difference is when you wiggle a note ACL knee, it doesn't like a

2133
01:57:35.72 --> 01:57:40.04
abruptly stop even if it's loose. So I'm saying. So like, if you have no ACL, it's like,

2134
01:57:40.04 --> 01:57:46.12
it's like a blunt, like, it's like if you had a big accord in there, like a real tense, like a tension

2135
01:57:46.12 --> 01:57:50.76
cord or something that didn't didn't stretch at all. And mine are just a little bit longer. You

2136
01:57:50.76 --> 01:57:54.52
assume same. So I have to loosen these. Nonetheless, so the point is I don't long. Expleship, I understand.

2137
01:57:56.12 --> 01:58:02.60
When I roll, you just go, they'll pop out sometimes. Lose ends. And then if they pop out,

2138
01:58:02.60 --> 01:58:07.48
and then I like kick or straighten out real quick or whatever, it'll pop out. And you know how you

2139
01:58:07.48 --> 01:58:12.76
bones, they're just kind of shaped like this. They do this and then they'll get like caught on each other.

2140
01:58:12.76 --> 01:58:16.28
And when they get caught on each other and you press, it'll like mess up the cartilage. Yeah.

2141
01:58:16.28 --> 01:58:21.40
So they'll get swollen on the inside at the end of the day. They get swollen for like some days.

2142
01:58:21.40 --> 01:58:25.64
They're gonna like warm a month more or whatever. But yeah, they take, I just take the grill oil.

2143
01:58:25.64 --> 01:58:30.28
I don't know, I just ignore the swelling. Yeah, no factor. And I'm pretty flexible too.

2144
01:58:30.28 --> 01:58:35.40
Check. No, no less. Anyway, you want to support yourself. There you go.

2145
01:58:35.40 --> 01:58:41.000
Jockel super cruel and joint warfare, boom, physical support on your supportive structures.

2146
01:58:42.12 --> 01:58:47.32
Also, if you're going to do you do, origin has a new key.

2147
01:58:48.60 --> 01:58:55.000
What is it? Your signature key is that we call it? No, no, no, that's not. Yeah, I mean, that's the key. It says cool stuff.

2148
01:58:55.000 --> 01:59:02.28
Yeah. Yeah. So I guess technically as far as what a signature something would be. Yeah, that's the

2149
01:59:02.28 --> 01:59:06.68
Jockel key. It's not called the Jockel key. Oh, no, we wouldn't be having it. I guess we have

2150
01:59:06.68 --> 01:59:12.12
Jockel party. Yeah, but that's just for a lack of a better name. Really true. This one. Yeah, no.

2151
01:59:12.12 --> 01:59:17.72
Anyway, the death key, the death key. Yeah, discipline equals freedom. G. It's a good one.

2152
01:59:17.72 --> 01:59:26.84
Kind of lighter weight. It's um, P. Tom, G. Please, P. said that the weave. Yeah, it's athletic. Weave. It's a real weave.

2153
01:59:26.84 --> 01:59:34.84
Yeah, it's not just taking cotton, which is what, which is what they just make pants from 1908 from.

2154
01:59:34.84 --> 01:59:38.68
Yeah, it's an athletic. And when you put it in the dryer, or you put it in the washing machine,

2155
01:59:38.68 --> 01:59:44.36
when you get down, it's almost dry. It's got cotton in it, but it's also got a poly blend. Yeah, yeah.

2156
01:59:44.36 --> 01:59:51.72
That's good stuff. And it's all made here in America. From the seed of the cotton, the very seed that you plant

2157
01:59:51.72 --> 01:59:55.64
the seed. I wonder where they get the seeds from. Charlie here. Yeah. You can see their Tennessee,

2158
01:59:55.64 --> 02:00:02.52
your South Carolina. Yeah. So if you want, we'll find out. Yeah, even buying the seeds or acquiring the seeds

2159
02:00:02.52 --> 02:00:07.08
in whatever capacity. Yeah, it's here in America. Planted in America, cotton grows in America.

2160
02:00:07.08 --> 02:00:11.96
Harvested in America, obviously. Died in America. Died in America. Died in America. It's up to

2161
02:00:11.96 --> 02:00:21.000
main repeat. We've it in a bunch of looms into fabric and into geese. Boom, right on your back.

2162
02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:25.88
Just start rolling all mean in America. That's all the stuff. And Virgin, by the way, if you don't know

2163
02:00:25.88 --> 02:00:30.76
already. And they got some good rashguards and compression gear, which is what the same thing.

2164
02:00:30.76 --> 02:00:36.28
Yeah, yeah. Brashguards and compression gear. I've noticed because I didn't use to use

2165
02:00:36.28 --> 02:00:46.44
rashguards other than for surfing. Do you notice you feel a little bit like the compression

2166
02:00:46.44 --> 02:00:53.32
helps you athletically? Do you feel that? I don't feel that. No, but I don't think I'm paying

2167
02:00:53.32 --> 02:00:58.28
attention to me on a seeding. Placiba. I'm just trying. What about people that get 19% improvement

2168
02:00:58.28 --> 02:01:04.92
in their geese skills? That's real. That's 100%. But me, you know, the first thing, but I hear

2169
02:01:04.92 --> 02:01:10.76
good things about compression. Like I see the links to articles that say all the performance

2170
02:01:10.76 --> 02:01:15.64
benefits and all this stuff. Here's the thing. I don't read them. I don't know. So, I wear

2171
02:01:16.52 --> 02:01:21.72
knee pads when I roll. Yeah. And I wear them for two reasons. Well, I wear them for three reasons.

2172
02:01:21.72 --> 02:01:28.76
Number one, just abrasions on the knee, right? Whatever. Matt burn on your knee. Which is cool.

2173
02:01:28.76 --> 02:01:34.36
You get it. Maybe you get it. Maybe you get it once every three days. That's once every three

2174
02:01:34.36 --> 02:01:38.12
days. You got Matt burn on your knee and you got blood and you got people that are like,

2175
02:01:38.12 --> 02:01:41.72
hey, I don't want to roll with you because you're bleeding or whatever. So, that's just a pain.

2176
02:01:41.72 --> 02:01:49.32
Number two, it for me keeps them warm, right? All right. You're right. You just get just warm

2177
02:01:49.32 --> 02:01:53.48
up your knees. And number three, it provides a little bit of compression that makes me feel good.

2178
02:01:53.48 --> 02:02:00.20
Now, I feel when I put on a rash guard, I feel like that on my body, which is good.

2179
02:02:00.20 --> 02:02:06.20
Yeah. I don't know. I think it feels good. Yeah. I'm compression gear. I can't speak really on it.

2180
02:02:06.20 --> 02:02:11.24
But I for damn sure it can't speak against it. And it's all made in America and there.

2181
02:02:11.24 --> 02:02:17.24
Do some research. Yeah. Yeah. If that even matters, you don't does that matter. That much.

2182
02:02:18.36 --> 02:02:25.56
Well, well, you wear it because it's efficient to roll in for sure. Yeah. The most efficient

2183
02:02:25.56 --> 02:02:29.96
thing you can roll in is a rash guard. Yeah. I feel like, like, hey, that's the uniform.

2184
02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:34.68
Be all the, the, the, what do you call it, ergonomic,

2185
02:02:34.68 --> 02:02:38.36
yes, ergonomic. It's like, you know how, like, you said the mat burn. You don't get

2186
02:02:38.36 --> 02:02:42.52
mat burn like all day every day. It's just like, yeah, if you, if you're going super hard and

2187
02:02:42.52 --> 02:02:46.52
you're knee or your elbow or whatever happens to be against the mat at it, you know, it's like,

2188
02:02:46.52 --> 02:02:51.000
it's a happenstent situation. Unless you're new. Unless you're new. You get mat burn. All in

2189
02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:54.76
that weird to where your body learns, appropriate reception to keep you from getting mat burn.

2190
02:02:54.76 --> 02:02:59.56
Hey, notice if you haven't rolled for a long time, you'll get your feet all mat burn. Your feet

2191
02:02:59.56 --> 02:03:04.84
tough for your knees get all mat burn up. When you're, when you know when you're in the roll,

2192
02:03:06.36 --> 02:03:12.04
mode, you barely get mat burn. You're like once every three or four rolls. Well, once every three

2193
02:03:12.04 --> 02:03:16.20
or four days, you'll get a little mat burn on top of your toes. Yeah. Bro, I haven't had mat burn

2194
02:03:16.20 --> 02:03:20.92
and tell my toes in like long time. It's like, yes, like your skin gets smart. You're like,

2195
02:03:20.92 --> 02:03:24.20
oh, what are we doing? Rolling? Okay. We had a tough enough right now. Have you rolled on a, like,

2196
02:03:24.20 --> 02:03:29.24
a reslight resting mat? Barefoot, after you've been rolling on a hard to tell me mat for a while.

2197
02:03:29.24 --> 02:03:35.40
It takes like a week to get used to it. Why? Because you, will stub your toe a bunch.

2198
02:03:35.40 --> 02:03:39.000
Because your toes won't know where to go. Because they're deeper and softer. Yeah. It's like,

2199
02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:43.08
when you play football on grass and you go to our, our defender. You got to use that. Yeah. It's weird.

2200
02:03:43.08 --> 02:03:49.56
Yeah. That's true. Anyway, cool, compression gear. Good. I'm glad that it's compression.

2201
02:03:50.20 --> 02:03:53.96
Because some people do care about that. And I think that if you go one of those people.

2202
02:03:53.96 --> 02:03:59.40
Oh, if you know the benefits in your benefiting from it, there you go. Boom. I just, I don't think I just

2203
02:03:59.40 --> 02:04:04.12
been paying attention, but after this guess what? I will. Because I'm not always right about things.

2204
02:04:04.12 --> 02:04:16.60
As far as the way I look at them. Also, also, I want to talk about on it. So, I would go into my whole

2205
02:04:16.60 --> 02:04:24.52
kettlebell routine, which is smashed yesterday. By the way, I got a new Cyclops one. By the way,

2206
02:04:26.60 --> 02:04:33.80
so again, cool. If you get regular kettlebells, they're regular ones. That's good. Because doing

2207
02:04:33.80 --> 02:04:39.48
kettlebells is way better than not doing kettlebells. When I recommend, see get the good ones. The dope,

2208
02:04:41.32 --> 02:04:45.40
decorative artistic. Duck, I don't like decorative. You like decorative. The word decorative. No,

2209
02:04:46.04 --> 02:04:53.48
here to win. Artistic artistic kettlebells. I say get those ones. They're just way cooler. Especially if

2210
02:04:53.48 --> 02:04:58.52
you're into Instagram stuff. That's what I think. It's my opinion. Nonetheless, they got regular ones as

2211
02:04:58.52 --> 02:05:02.28
well. Go to on it.com slash jockel. They have a bunch of fitness stuff. I noticed

2212
02:05:02.28 --> 02:05:10.36
jocgos mace. That he recommend I use for like other stuff, which is actually part of a big point

2213
02:05:10.36 --> 02:05:16.04
that you can use a lot of this stuff for like various different sorts of exercise activities. Yeah.

2214
02:05:16.04 --> 02:05:21.96
And they have like a bunch of cool stuff on there. Like stuff that's different from your traditional

2215
02:05:23.08 --> 02:05:30.28
bench squat, you know, functional stuff. Check. Nonetheless, on it duck, I'm slash jockel. Go there,

2216
02:05:30.28 --> 02:05:36.84
boom. Support yourself. Expand your workout man. If you want, you could be like jocquood does the same thing

2217
02:05:36.84 --> 02:05:41.24
over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and

2218
02:05:41.24 --> 02:05:46.20
over. You can do very. But they vary over and over and over and it can. They also have some

2219
02:05:46.20 --> 02:05:52.60
strong actually. Actually. They need to be honest myself. I do the same. You got to work out all the time

2220
02:05:52.60 --> 02:05:57.96
with variations, but those variations will come in cycles that go over the same pattern. Yeah, but that's

2221
02:05:57.96 --> 02:06:02.84
kind of the whole point of work out though. It's like your body gets used to certain activities. You

2222
02:06:02.84 --> 02:06:06.68
can't let it get too used to it. That's why they say, you're going to switch it up.

2223
02:06:06.68 --> 02:06:09.64
The shock your body, all the stuff. But if you're constantly just shocking your body,

2224
02:06:09.64 --> 02:06:13.56
you're like, okay, we're doing your body is kind of saying this to you. It's like, okay, what are we

2225
02:06:13.56 --> 02:06:18.60
doing? I'm going to get as good at it as possible. Okay. So however many times we got to do this thing,

2226
02:06:18.60 --> 02:06:22.92
I'm going to try it in my best. As long as you feed me and rest me, I'm trying my best to accommodate

2227
02:06:22.92 --> 02:06:28.60
you as far as, you know, get in better at this thing. Now, if you give me one thing to do and say,

2228
02:06:28.60 --> 02:06:33.88
get good at that, we're never doing it again. You know, there's no real results except for maybe

2229
02:06:33.88 --> 02:06:39.64
the underlying system, you know, maybe like your heart rate or your, you know, those types of things.

2230
02:06:39.64 --> 02:06:44.68
Maybe you're, what do you call your, you know, when you can endure like hard stuff,

2231
02:06:44.68 --> 02:06:50.20
durable. Yeah, like mental durability, maybe that, but if you do like one exercise, sure, you'll

2232
02:06:50.20 --> 02:06:55.000
be sore and then that's kind of it. The benefits of that program won't really. Then again,

2233
02:06:55.000 --> 02:06:59.56
I don't know, I could be wrong. I could be missing like some new science on the deal nonetheless.

2234
02:07:00.12 --> 02:07:04.60
Research it. Search it, get a good workout routine. And if you want to expand it,

2235
02:07:04.60 --> 02:07:14.92
go to on it because they have the good stuff. Also, if you want to get Timothy Ferris's book

2236
02:07:14.92 --> 02:07:21.48
that Jockel was quoting Jockel's in there, by the way. How many times many coats do you have in there?

2237
02:07:21.48 --> 02:07:28.28
I don't know. 11. Just 11 questions. 11 answers. Jockel, so these and they're the same, right?

2238
02:07:28.28 --> 02:07:32.28
They're the same as the same all the course. All the course. All the stuff. Yeah. And he was a

2239
02:07:32.28 --> 02:07:36.60
thing like Tim will post like little excerpts of like just little quotes, you know,

2240
02:07:37.24 --> 02:07:41.000
and that's really interesting thing that he did there where he asked everyone the same question.

2241
02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:45.72
Oh, yeah, because that's a person Tim's personality. He looks for patterns. Yeah. Yeah. That's

2242
02:07:45.72 --> 02:07:51.40
how you find patterns. That's super. It's something. It's so it's basically you have 11 categories

2243
02:07:51.40 --> 02:07:57.32
of advice that you can get from these top-level people in different like industries different.

2244
02:07:57.32 --> 02:08:03.80
And then he's got like he's kind of sorts them in the back. So you can see what everyone

2245
02:08:03.80 --> 02:08:08.92
is. He kind of assembles the information in some various ways in the back of the book so you

2246
02:08:08.92 --> 02:08:16.60
can sort of pull the knowledge. Yeah, man. That's great. That's good. Yeah, man. I actually like that kind

2247
02:08:17.64 --> 02:08:22.04
but that is smart though. So that's essentially what you have. You have this big book of advice

2248
02:08:22.04 --> 02:08:30.28
from all these complete experts that is exactly what it is. Yeah. Yeah. So there you go. When you get that,

2249
02:08:30.84 --> 02:08:36.28
just go to here. Look, we'll offer it. Jockelpodcast.com. Go on the top. Top menu. Books from the

2250
02:08:36.28 --> 02:08:41.80
episodes. Boom. I got you right there. Tribal mentors by Timothy Ferris. Click through there.

2251
02:08:41.80 --> 02:08:46.12
It's a good way to support. If you want to shop for anything else, go ahead and do that. Carry on,

2252
02:08:46.12 --> 02:08:55.08
man. Support away. Some people think that that's not a big deal. It is a big deal. Clicking through

2253
02:08:55.08 --> 02:09:01.32
there. I mean, it is a big deal. It's hard to do. Easy to do. Small action. Small action.

2254
02:09:01.32 --> 02:09:09.32
Big reaction. Yeah. Just like sodium when you throw it into water. Anyway, subscribe to the podcast.

2255
02:09:10.44 --> 02:09:16.60
YouTube. That's for the video version. But on iTunes and Google play,

2256
02:09:16.60 --> 02:09:23.80
stitch your podcasting, providing platforms. Seems obvious, but if you haven't already subscribed,

2257
02:09:23.80 --> 02:09:28.36
just a good way to support. Also YouTube, like I said, video version of this podcast. Also excerpts.

2258
02:09:28.36 --> 02:09:34.76
If you want to share a little ideas that have emerged from the podcast, you want to share them

2259
02:09:34.76 --> 02:09:40.12
individually. They're on there. Most of them. I work on them every week. Put them on there.

2260
02:09:41.24 --> 02:09:46.12
You can share them. It's good with reason to subscribe to the YouTube. Also, I'll put some,

2261
02:09:46.12 --> 02:09:50.12
you know how people what's called this like mashups. They're called mashups.

2262
02:09:50.12 --> 02:09:55.64
Yeah. When you put like an excerpt on your voice. Oh, they put music videos. Yes. They put some video.

2263
02:09:55.64 --> 02:09:59.64
So, you know, visual aid is what it's called. Wait, do you make mashups?

2264
02:09:59.64 --> 02:10:03.96
Make, I don't, here's the thing though. So a mashup is like you just take various clips,

2265
02:10:03.96 --> 02:10:08.52
you know, of whatever, you know, like they're just visually. You do like a whole thematic thing.

2266
02:10:08.52 --> 02:10:11.88
And that's kind of the thing. So I don't know. If you don't know, those, that's not really.

2267
02:10:11.88 --> 02:10:15.32
Do you think about it? Kind of. Sometimes taking a shot.

2268
02:10:17.16 --> 02:10:24.92
Yeah. I don't know. Block. Read the war of art. Or I might be just working diligently and obsessively

2269
02:10:24.92 --> 02:10:30.92
on maybe new approaches and methods. Put the war of art on their part on our side too. So people can get that.

2270
02:10:30.92 --> 02:10:36.12
The war of art. Yeah. I read down. That's good. Yeah. I need to maybe revisit it for this.

2271
02:10:36.12 --> 02:10:43.72
For the video production standpoint. Nonetheless, when I do make those videos, I put them on YouTube.

2272
02:10:44.60 --> 02:10:48.44
And that's yet another reason to subscribe. On top of the fact that it does support

2273
02:10:48.44 --> 02:10:53.48
the podcast. So it's like a big circle loop of support. You see what I'm saying? Also,

2274
02:10:53.48 --> 02:10:59.48
Jocquas is a store. It's called Jocquasdoor.com. Is where you can get your

2275
02:10:59.48 --> 02:11:05.000
disciplining quotes to freedom. Sure it get after it. Sure it. And other shirts.

2276
02:11:06.28 --> 02:11:09.96
Of that type. Also, rashguards on their new rashguards on there.

2277
02:11:09.96 --> 02:11:19.96
Two new rashguards on there. I don't know. Two or three. You got to look. Jocquasdoor.com.

2278
02:11:19.96 --> 02:11:26.60
The rashguard is sodium. Small action. That's a rashguard. I don't know. I got to take the

2279
02:11:26.60 --> 02:11:33.80
pictures. I got to list them. So during that process, hopefully. Sounds like that's a real hard

2280
02:11:33.80 --> 02:11:39.16
hard. Take pictures and list them. I'm trying to. Anyone want to job out there in the world? Any

2281
02:11:39.16 --> 02:11:47.16
way. I have a hard time taking pictures of a rashguard. Warier kid rashguards for youth. Nice. For the

2282
02:11:47.16 --> 02:11:53.48
warrior kids themselves. So look out for that. My little daughter was sporting hers today. I know.

2283
02:11:53.48 --> 02:11:58.60
It looks good. It looks good. It looks very, very, very good. Nonetheless, they're on there.

2284
02:11:58.60 --> 02:12:03.64
Drugs. There are some hats on there. Beanie's coming as well. And other stuff. Look out there.

2285
02:12:03.64 --> 02:12:07.96
Yes. I'm not saying goodbye. Beanie. I'm not saying that. You might not need one. Maybe you're

2286
02:12:07.96 --> 02:12:12.52
in Hawaii. Yeah. But you're wearing a bikini in Hawaii just for the look. But maybe you're in

2287
02:12:12.52 --> 02:12:19.32
shi-down. Yeah. And you need to be in Michigan somewhere. Dang. Nonetheless, gone there.

2288
02:12:20.04 --> 02:12:23.72
If you like something, get something. Good way to support. Also psychological warfare on your

2289
02:12:23.72 --> 02:12:29.16
campaigning against weakness. That's what we're going with right now. Campaign against weakness.

2290
02:12:29.16 --> 02:12:37.16
Improving yourself. You're going from a person who is incapable of detaching, who is incapable

2291
02:12:37.16 --> 02:12:42.84
of understanding the message rather than your feeling about the message. If you're that person

2292
02:12:42.84 --> 02:12:47.88
yet, you're on the path to become a different person. Someone who can understand the message first,

2293
02:12:47.88 --> 02:12:52.60
feeling second. The ability to detach, we're always working on it. And if you're working on that as well,

2294
02:12:52.60 --> 02:12:58.52
this is what you do. You hit those moments of weakness. You have this album with tracks,

2295
02:12:58.52 --> 02:13:04.68
jockel tracks called psychological warfare. What it does is it takes any little element of your

2296
02:13:05.88 --> 02:13:10.76
campaigning against weakness. Any little element that you might slip on. You might see that.

2297
02:13:10.76 --> 02:13:13.80
Yeah. Sound like you're at there. You said that. Make slip on it. Oh.

2298
02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:21.000
May feel a little weak. When you wake up or when you're about to wake up, when you're about to get

2299
02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:24.68
up, when you wake up, you're about to get up. It's 430 and you're like dang, I'm going to press

2300
02:13:24.68 --> 02:13:29.32
this news. Don't worry. There's a track for that. You play that track, jockel. Give you pragmatic

2301
02:13:29.32 --> 02:13:33.96
advice on why you shouldn't hit this news. Same thing goes for skipping. You're work out,

2302
02:13:33.96 --> 02:13:40.28
same thing goes for skipping on your diet, slipping on your diet. Creative blah, progressive.

2303
02:13:40.28 --> 02:13:44.20
All these things is like tracks for a word. Jockel is telling you why you shouldn't do that. It's like,

2304
02:13:44.20 --> 02:13:49.32
hey, don't do that. You know, this is why this is why it's beneficial for you to continue all that stuff.

2305
02:13:49.32 --> 02:13:58.36
It's a good one. It helps 100% effective in spotting people when they need a little spot. If

2306
02:13:58.36 --> 02:14:02.20
then if you need a spot, sometimes you don't need a spot. Sometimes you're just getting after 100%.

2307
02:14:03.000 --> 02:14:09.24
100%. But that's a good one for that. You also on Amazon can get jockel white tea,

2308
02:14:10.36 --> 02:14:15.96
which is good. If you don't believe me, go read the reviews on there. I'll read some of them

2309
02:14:15.96 --> 02:14:21.16
again. I'll read a couple of them on here. But you can read them yourself. The reviews explain

2310
02:14:21.16 --> 02:14:30.20
that when you drink jockel white tea, you can deadlift 8,000 pounds at a minimum. So that's a guarantee.

2311
02:14:30.76 --> 02:14:36.52
People don't understand. It's guaranteed. Yeah. If you don't think, if you can't, I'll give you your

2312
02:14:36.52 --> 02:14:42.84
money back to the team. Yeah. Uh, they also got some books. You can get them anywhere. Really

2313
02:14:42.84 --> 02:14:51.72
way. Way the warrior kid. Thank you. Everyone that gives me feedback all the time. Kids that are

2314
02:14:52.52 --> 02:14:59.96
doing various things like studying, like reading the book, studying, doing jiu-jitsu, doing pull-ups,

2315
02:15:00.36 --> 02:15:06.68
swimming, competing, just all kinds of awesome stuff. Everything from figure skating to ballet,

2316
02:15:06.68 --> 02:15:14.92
to wrestling, seeing it all. Little warrior kids getting after it. That's a book for any

2317
02:15:14.92 --> 02:15:23.64
kid that you want to put on the proper path of discipline, of hard work. The next book,

2318
02:15:23.64 --> 02:15:30.76
the next warrior kid book, is coming out April 28th. I'll let you know when it pops up for pre-order.

2319
02:15:32.44 --> 02:15:36.52
Extreme ownership, the new addition is out. It's longer. It has a little new forward in it.

2320
02:15:36.52 --> 02:15:39.88
It's got some new pictures, colored pictures, by the way, colored. Oh, dang.

2321
02:15:39.88 --> 02:15:43.56
It's stepping it up. No, I don't like that. Oh, I know. Make them black and white.

2322
02:15:43.56 --> 02:15:50.76
Black and white only. That's how I roll. Yeah. Yeah. There's also some Q&A on there, which is the Q&A

2323
02:15:50.76 --> 02:15:58.68
that's in the new version is from this podcast, which means it's from you listeners. So thank you

2324
02:15:58.68 --> 02:16:04.92
for the questions. And also the new version, it's black. And it's flat black. Did you notice that?

2325
02:16:04.92 --> 02:16:12.36
Yeah. That makes it even better. It's regular black. Right. Well, what's regular black?

2326
02:16:12.36 --> 02:16:16.20
glossy. Oh, glossy. You hear that dog parking? Yeah. That's legit.

2327
02:16:17.40 --> 02:16:22.20
Savage. Yeah. There must be somebody invading the podcast space.

2328
02:16:23.32 --> 02:16:27.24
Yeah. You can get the the new version of Extreme ownership right now. Flat black.

2329
02:16:27.24 --> 02:16:31.80
Questions from the podcast, all that. Also, discipline equals freedom. Field manual.

2330
02:16:31.80 --> 02:16:39.08
So, um, this is book. It's not a normal book, right? We know that.

2331
02:16:40.68 --> 02:16:46.68
It's a book that when you if you give it to somebody, they don't feel like, oh, he just went

2332
02:16:46.68 --> 02:16:53.40
around the book. They don't feel like that. They think, because it's not normal. So the publisher knows

2333
02:16:53.40 --> 02:17:01.80
that, right? So they want an little tagline. And they sent me some, hey, we come up with some taglines.

2334
02:17:01.80 --> 02:17:08.44
And they gave me this tagline. Sure. Can I make fun of my publisher? Yes. Sounds like I'm going to

2335
02:17:08.44 --> 02:17:13.88
do that right now. So my publisher, they say, we're going to make it. We're going to have a little tagline.

2336
02:17:14.84 --> 02:17:20.28
You can tell you a book. And they said, well, you know, here's our tagline. This book makes

2337
02:17:20.28 --> 02:17:26.84
a great gift from a holiday season. It's not that like that, right? And they send me, because

2338
02:17:26.84 --> 02:17:31.64
because I always say, like, hey, don't be saying stuff about my stuff without asking me first.

2339
02:17:31.64 --> 02:17:35.08
Yeah. Because you guys will say dumb stuff about my cool stuff. And I like that.

2340
02:17:36.68 --> 02:17:43.08
So they said, it's book makes a great holiday gift. Whatever. And I said, no, when I thought about it,

2341
02:17:43.08 --> 02:17:51.40
for four seconds, and I wrote them back. And I said, use this. There's no better gift than the gift of

2342
02:17:51.40 --> 02:18:00.28
discipline. Boom. Factually, there's your tagline. So for your people in your life, that you don't want

2343
02:18:00.28 --> 02:18:09.64
to get them a stupid gift, like a neck tie or a belt or something else that they don't want or need,

2344
02:18:09.64 --> 02:18:16.92
sure. They need this book. The best gift you can give is the gift of discipline. So there you go.

2345
02:18:16.92 --> 02:18:22.20
That's a, hey, by the way, people keep asking me. And I keep telling everyone, everyone wants

2346
02:18:22.20 --> 02:18:27.16
the audio version of this book. And they say, when is it coming out? It's out. It's out.

2347
02:18:28.04 --> 02:18:33.64
The audio version of Displand equals freedom field manual. It's out right now. It's on iTunes.

2348
02:18:33.64 --> 02:18:39.40
It's on Amazon music. It's on Google Play. It's on other MP3 platforms. The reason we did that

2349
02:18:39.40 --> 02:18:46.20
is because if you put it on audible, audible, you can't pull it out as tracks and use it for a

2350
02:18:46.20 --> 02:18:50.60
alarm or use it to spot yourself if you get a moment of weakness, which this book is good for.

2351
02:18:51.32 --> 02:18:57.08
So that's where you can get the audio version. Beyond the books, beyond the podcast for

2358
02:19:47.40 --> 02:19:53.88
and for giving us the ability to do this podcast and to the families of those service men and

2359
02:19:53.88 --> 02:20:01.16
women that are supporting them from home. Thank you for your sacrifice day to day. It is much appreciated

2360

when it comes. And to everyone else, that's listening. Just remember that sure, you have a team.

2363
02:20:21.80 --> 02:20:28.84
You have friends and family and co-workers and colleagues and you have a support network and

2364
02:20:28.84 --> 02:20:38.04
you have people you can call and that's great, but don't count on them. Don't wait for them. Don't

2365
02:20:38.04 --> 02:20:48.04
assume that they are coming to the rescue. Take lead, take ownership, take action, get out there

2366
02:20:49.80 --> 02:20:57.24
and get after it. So until next time, this is Echo and Jocco.

2367
02:20:57.24 --> 02:20:59.24
Out.
