00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.64 This is Jocco podcast number 15 with echo Charles and me, Jocco Willink.
00:00:08.64 --> 00:00:10.64 Good evening, echo.
00:00:10.64 --> 00:00:15.52 Good evening.
00:00:15.52 --> 00:00:19.76 I looked around at the men.
00:00:19.76 --> 00:00:23.88 I was the only one looking around.
00:00:23.88 --> 00:00:33.80 All the other heads were bowed down, all of them praying.
00:00:33.80 --> 00:00:37.40 These men were going into battle, real battle.
00:00:37.40 --> 00:00:42.64 We could literally hear machine gun fire in the distance where the battle would take place.
00:00:42.64 --> 00:00:47.96 These men had suffered an incredible number of casualties.
00:00:47.96 --> 00:00:52.08 They had every reason to pray.
00:00:52.08 --> 00:00:57.000 I was with Charlie Company.
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.12 From one of the most hallowed units in the US military, the first in the 506, the band
00:01:02.12 --> 00:01:08.32 of brothers made famous by their unbelievable performance in World War II, which was documented
00:01:08.32 --> 00:01:16.60 in the book, Band of Brothers, which became an HBO mini series of the same name.
00:01:16.60 --> 00:01:25.72 The first of the 506 and Ramadi held the line on that tradition of glory and service and courage.
00:01:25.72 --> 00:01:34.20 There's nothing I can say that we'll do justice to the admiration and the respect that I had
00:01:34.20 --> 00:01:43.08 for the first of the 506 and that all of a seals had for the first of the 506.
00:01:43.08 --> 00:01:52.16 The seals that I sent to work directly with the 506, they became adopted by the 506,
00:01:52.16 --> 00:01:59.80 red curhy, that's one of the nicknames for the 506.
00:01:59.80 --> 00:02:04.68 The seals that were directly there, working with them absolutely loved the 506.
00:02:04.68 --> 00:02:14.96 The 506 represented everything good I can imagine in a military team or any team, professional
00:02:14.96 --> 00:02:20.48 and discipline and motivated and creative.
00:02:20.48 --> 00:02:28.52 The leadership in the battalion was absolutely outstanding.
00:02:28.52 --> 00:02:35.80 The battalion commander, he was the very essence of leadership, he was calm and direct
00:02:35.80 --> 00:02:44.04 and friendly and open-minded and respectful and respected.
00:02:44.04 --> 00:02:51.36 His staff and the company commanders and the senior NCOs, they had this unified thread
00:02:51.36 --> 00:02:56.96 between them, this bond, this connection.
00:02:56.96 --> 00:03:03.80 It was that tradition and that sense of purpose and that standard of excellence and professionalism.
00:03:03.80 --> 00:03:12.68 It's hard to describe, but it was absolutely there and it was as real as the sand
00:03:12.68 --> 00:03:18.88 and the bullets and the guns.
00:03:18.88 --> 00:03:23.88 There I was and this was early in my deployment to Romadi with tasked and bruiser.
00:03:23.88 --> 00:03:30.80 I was about to go out into the Malab district with Charlie Company and their company
00:03:30.80 --> 00:03:37.08 commander was just an outstanding guy.
00:03:37.08 --> 00:03:42.72 And I knew that this unit and this company and this battalion, I knew was something special
00:03:42.72 --> 00:03:53.08 and I knew that that term, the band of brothers, I knew that that's what they truly were.
00:03:53.08 --> 00:04:01.36 When we hear it and I know it's a book and it's a HBO series but where does it come from?
00:04:01.36 --> 00:04:06.20 Now most people have heard that simple quote.
00:04:06.20 --> 00:04:13.60 We few, we happy few, we band of brothers for he today that sheds his blood with me shall
00:04:13.60 --> 00:04:20.28 be my brother.
00:04:20.28 --> 00:04:22.88 I knew what that quote was.
00:04:22.88 --> 00:04:24.60 I knew where it came from.
00:04:24.60 --> 00:04:30.36 I was an English major in college and I knew that that was Shakespeare and I knew that
00:04:30.36 --> 00:04:42.80 that was Henry the Fifth and I knew how powerful that quote was.
00:04:42.80 --> 00:04:47.000 Now when you start talking about Shakespeare and you start talking about Henry the Fifth,
00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.76 there's all kinds of different directions you can go because you can go back and you
00:04:51.76 --> 00:04:57.12 can look at what Henry the Fifth was like in real life and if you was like the leader
00:04:57.12 --> 00:05:02.000 that Shakespeare made him into in the play and you could talk about Shakespeare himself
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:09.56 and the rumors and the myths and the legends that circulate his life and his legacy
00:05:09.56 --> 00:05:13.56 because there's all kinds of questions about Shakespeare.
00:05:13.56 --> 00:05:17.80 I mean did he actually write all of his plays?
00:05:17.80 --> 00:05:19.28 Was he more than one person?
00:05:19.28 --> 00:05:20.88 Was he a soldier at some point?
00:05:20.88 --> 00:05:27.28 How did he know all this stuff about the military and what it was like to be a soldier?
00:05:27.28 --> 00:05:31.76 Was his vocabulary ten times what a normal person is?
00:05:31.76 --> 00:05:40.56 There's all kinds of like I said, rumor and myth about Shakespeare.
00:05:40.56 --> 00:05:46.68 And instead of talking about all that and the conjecture and the hypothetical questions
00:05:46.68 --> 00:05:56.88 I would rather talk about something that is known, something that we have today and those
00:05:56.88 --> 00:06:02.04 are the words.
00:06:02.04 --> 00:06:09.32 Words from the play Henry the Fifth which yes was written by Shakespeare and I'm going
00:06:09.32 --> 00:06:14.60 to tell you don't be scared and don't be intimidated by that.
00:06:14.60 --> 00:06:21.36 I mean don't be scared and don't be intimidated by Shakespeare because you don't understand
00:06:21.36 --> 00:06:24.68 it because you can't.
00:06:24.68 --> 00:06:34.04 And the fact of the matter is no one can at least at first it's not possible to understand
00:06:34.04 --> 00:06:36.16 Shakespeare out of the gate.
00:06:36.16 --> 00:06:38.16 It doesn't work.
00:06:38.16 --> 00:06:40.76 It's another language.
00:06:40.76 --> 00:06:43.44 It is another language.
00:06:43.44 --> 00:06:45.28 You can't be expected to understand it.
00:06:45.28 --> 00:06:50.24 It's written in something called Early Modern English.
00:06:50.24 --> 00:06:51.36 We speak English.
00:06:51.36 --> 00:06:57.68 This is Early Modern English which is just a transition from something called Middle English.
00:06:57.68 --> 00:07:03.16 And if you go on YouTube and you look up Middle English and you have somebody read a real
00:07:03.16 --> 00:07:04.16 common one.
00:07:04.16 --> 00:07:08.64 It's a lower prayer in Middle English. you can barely understand it.
00:07:08.64 --> 00:07:13.08 Parts of it you can't understand parts of the word you recognize.
00:07:13.08 --> 00:07:19.76 But when you get to Early Modern English now it's a step closer but it's still there's
00:07:19.76 --> 00:07:24.04 different it's a different type of language and there's archaic words and there's obsolete
00:07:24.04 --> 00:07:29.12 words and there's words that Shakespeare just made up he would make up words.
00:07:29.12 --> 00:07:35.000 And it's actually in the patterns of speech or different in the idioms or different and the references
00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:42.68 are all historical and so if you don't have a grasp on those mythological references
00:07:42.68 --> 00:07:46.48 and historical references and biblical references then it doesn't have the meaning that
00:07:46.48 --> 00:07:47.72 it's supposed to have.
00:07:47.72 --> 00:07:54.32 So you can't expect just to open up Shakespeare and be able to understand it.
00:07:54.32 --> 00:07:58.68 Now this is actually the opposite of what I often say because to me you hear me say
00:07:58.68 --> 00:08:03.08 all the time that what makes English so important is that you can make things very simple
00:08:03.08 --> 00:08:07.44 and very understandable by everybody so then why is it important?
00:08:07.44 --> 00:08:08.68 Why should we read it?
00:08:08.68 --> 00:08:13.76 Why should we try and understand it?
00:08:13.76 --> 00:08:21.40 And the answer that question is actually very simple.
00:08:21.40 --> 00:08:27.88 Shakespeare had something.
00:08:27.88 --> 00:08:28.88 He had something.
00:08:28.88 --> 00:08:38.36 He had some understanding, some knowledge, some insight into the human mind that is not
00:08:38.36 --> 00:08:40.36 normal.
00:08:40.36 --> 00:08:41.68 It's not normal.
00:08:41.68 --> 00:08:48.24 He understood people deeply.
00:08:48.24 --> 00:08:53.32 He understood relationships, he understood leadership, he understood love and he understood
00:08:53.32 --> 00:08:57.48 war and I don't know how he did this and I know why he did.
00:08:57.48 --> 00:09:06.20 And on top of that he had this talent he had this gift to translate that knowledge into
00:09:06.20 --> 00:09:10.40 words.
00:09:10.40 --> 00:09:17.24 And this is important because in the late 1500s and the early 1600s this is a whole
00:09:17.24 --> 00:09:18.24 another deal.
00:09:18.24 --> 00:09:19.84 There's no special effects.
00:09:19.84 --> 00:09:22.20 There's no close-up shots of an actor.
00:09:22.20 --> 00:09:23.56 There's no stunt man.
00:09:23.56 --> 00:09:27.44 There's no CGI.
00:09:27.44 --> 00:09:33.12 Everything has to be contained in the words, all the emotion and all the feeling and
00:09:33.12 --> 00:09:38.68 all the action and all the nature of human beings.
00:09:38.68 --> 00:09:45.84 It all has to be captured in the words.
00:09:45.84 --> 00:09:51.04 And the words that Shakespeare uses are heavy.
00:09:51.04 --> 00:09:57.32 And they're also their parragnant, their parragnant with so much more meaning than
00:09:57.32 --> 00:09:59.40 what's on the surface.
00:09:59.40 --> 00:10:09.24 They're filled with depth and knowledge that you have to scrape away and uncover to figure
00:10:09.24 --> 00:10:16.52 out what they're even talking about.
00:10:16.52 --> 00:10:20.16 But let's take a look at this.
00:10:20.16 --> 00:10:25.76 This famous speech in Henry V.
00:10:25.76 --> 00:10:29.84 The play of the same name.
00:10:29.84 --> 00:10:36.44 And I'm going to lead into it a little bit just to kind of at least set the context of
00:10:36.44 --> 00:10:37.48 what's happening.
00:10:37.48 --> 00:10:44.80 And as I went into my notes, just the opening when you've got this guy that kind of
00:10:44.80 --> 00:10:50.36 comes out and describes to you what's going to happen in the play.
00:10:50.36 --> 00:10:56.96 And he kind of introduces Henry, they call him Harry.
00:10:56.96 --> 00:11:02.44 Any introduces him with this line.
00:11:02.44 --> 00:11:11.68 Then should the warlike Harry like himself assume the port of Mars and at his heels
00:11:11.68 --> 00:11:23.88 leashed in like hounds should famine, sword and fire, crouch for employment.
00:11:23.88 --> 00:11:28.92 So if you break that down, first of all he's coming out of the gate, he's saying Harry
00:11:28.92 --> 00:11:38.28 is warlike, which means he's fond of war and skilled in it and equipped for it.
00:11:38.28 --> 00:11:46.92 And in a more literal meeting it's saying Henry is like war himself, which means he has
00:11:46.92 --> 00:11:53.64 complexities and the youth and the mayhem and the chaos inside himself.
00:11:53.64 --> 00:12:00.08 And then it goes on to say that he should assume the port of Mars, which means he should
00:12:00.08 --> 00:12:05.52 take on the bearing of Mars, which is the Roman god of war.
00:12:05.52 --> 00:12:10.80 That is heels, so down now by his feet leashed in like hounds.
00:12:10.80 --> 00:12:20.64 So you've got dogs, angry dogs, on leashes and those dogs are famine, sword and fire.
00:12:20.64 --> 00:12:24.04 And in those days that was war.
00:12:24.04 --> 00:12:29.16 Because when you did siege warfare on somebody and you locked down their castle, you starved
00:12:29.16 --> 00:12:30.16 them.
00:12:30.16 --> 00:12:35.000 Once they were weakened, you burned their castle and then used the sword to finish them
00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:36.000 off.
00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:43.000 So he had those dogs of war at his side and they were crouched for employment.
00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:53.40 If you can imagine a pit bull just tense and coiled like a spring ready to pounce.
00:12:53.40 --> 00:13:01.76 That's the opening to describe Henry.
00:13:01.76 --> 00:13:17.64 So they're at war with France and they go to take down this town of Harflur.
00:13:17.64 --> 00:13:22.88 And at this point this is one of the other really famous speeches from Henry the fifth.
00:13:22.88 --> 00:13:28.24 And at this point they've broken through the walls and there's a breach in the wall.
00:13:28.24 --> 00:13:30.52 So there's a hole in the wall.
00:13:30.52 --> 00:13:33.12 But the French are still defending it.
00:13:33.12 --> 00:13:35.12 The French are still defending it pretty well.
00:13:35.12 --> 00:13:37.56 And so Henry has a little chat with his troopers.
00:13:37.56 --> 00:13:40.96 And this is a pretty famous speech.
00:13:40.96 --> 00:13:47.92 And he says once more unto the breach dear friends, once more, or close the wall up with
00:13:47.92 --> 00:13:50.24 our English dead.
00:13:50.24 --> 00:13:55.96 So he's saying that hole in the wall, charge it, charge it and either get through it
00:13:55.96 --> 00:14:01.16 or fill up the wall with our dead.
00:14:01.16 --> 00:14:09.16 And then he says in peace there's nothing so becomes a man as modest stillness and humility.
00:14:09.16 --> 00:14:17.16 So when things are when things are peaceful, being calm and being humble is a good thing.
00:14:17.16 --> 00:14:26.04 But when the blast of war blows in our ears, then imitate the action of the tiger.
00:14:26.04 --> 00:14:28.80 So when war comes, never mind peace and calm.
00:14:28.80 --> 00:14:30.84 It's time to be like a tiger.
00:14:30.84 --> 00:14:36.84 And he says stiff in the sinews, summon up the blood to sky's fair nature with hard
00:14:36.84 --> 00:14:42.76 favored rage.
00:14:42.76 --> 00:14:49.56 So tense your body and summon up your rage.
00:14:49.56 --> 00:14:53.84 Then lend the eye a terrible aspect.
00:14:53.84 --> 00:14:58.56 Let pride through the portage of the head like the brass cannon.
00:14:58.56 --> 00:15:01.52 Let the brow overwhelm it.
00:15:01.52 --> 00:15:09.60 So what you say in there is, throw your brow and let your eye poke through your brow like
00:15:09.60 --> 00:15:11.36 a cannon.
00:15:11.36 --> 00:15:17.84 Like a brass cannon sticking out of a port hole.
00:15:17.84 --> 00:15:25.000 As furfully as Dotha gollid rock overhang and juddy his confounded based swilled with the
00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.08 wild and wasteful ocean.
00:15:27.08 --> 00:15:32.52 So he's saying make your brow overhang your eyes like a rock that druts out over the wild
00:15:32.52 --> 00:15:36.84 ocean.
00:15:36.84 --> 00:15:43.76 And then now set the teeth and stretch the nostril wide, hold hard the breath and bend
00:15:43.76 --> 00:15:46.92 up every spirit till its full height.
00:15:46.92 --> 00:15:53.20 So you know what that one is, bite down, grit your teeth, flare your nostrils, take
00:15:53.20 --> 00:15:59.96 a deep breath and hold it in and bring every emotion you have to its utmost.
00:15:59.96 --> 00:16:11.56 And like like a tension on a bow on on unenobless English whose blood is fed from fathers
00:16:11.56 --> 00:16:20.10 of war proof, fathers like so many Alexander's having these parts from more until even
00:16:20.10 --> 00:16:25.28 fought and sheed their swords for lack of argument.
00:16:25.28 --> 00:16:28.28 So he's saying listen.
00:16:28.28 --> 00:16:30.48 You got to fight.
00:16:30.48 --> 00:16:31.48 You got to fight.
00:16:31.48 --> 00:16:41.88 You English men whose blood is from combat tested warriors like Alexander the Great.
00:16:41.88 --> 00:16:47.24 And those men have fought on this soil from morning until night forever and they only
00:16:47.24 --> 00:16:55.32 sheed their swords when there was no one else to fight.
00:16:55.32 --> 00:16:57.24 Do not dishonor your mothers.
00:16:57.24 --> 00:17:01.24 Now a test that whom you called fathers did begot you.
00:17:01.24 --> 00:17:05.28 So don't dishonor your mom.
00:17:05.28 --> 00:17:12.12 Prove that your father with his warrior blood is really your father.
00:17:12.12 --> 00:17:20.04 Be copy now to men of grosser blood and teach them how to war.
00:17:20.04 --> 00:17:26.92 That means being example to the lesser man to the weaker man and show them how to war.
00:17:26.92 --> 00:17:36.52 And you good young men whose limbs were made in England show us here the metal of your
00:17:36.52 --> 00:17:38.72 pasture.
00:17:38.72 --> 00:17:43.24 So young men were basically like the troopers, the foot soldiers and the archers and he
00:17:43.24 --> 00:17:49.80 saying show us how you were born in England and the pasture.
00:17:49.80 --> 00:17:52.80 That's where you were raised like a cow was raised on a pasture.
00:17:52.80 --> 00:17:55.36 Show us what the metal of that pasture is.
00:17:55.36 --> 00:18:02.80 Let us swear that you are worth your breeding which I doubt not.
00:18:02.80 --> 00:18:10.04 For there is none of you so mean and base that have not noble luster in your eyes.
00:18:10.04 --> 00:18:16.44 So no matter where these guys are from, no matter what level of society they came from.
00:18:16.44 --> 00:18:24.36 He sees the noble luster and the righteous gleam in their eyes.
00:18:24.36 --> 00:18:33.80 I see you stand like gray hounds in the slips straining upon the start.
00:18:33.80 --> 00:18:39.88 Now gray hounds, you know, now we're using for racing, they used to be used to hunt to
00:18:39.88 --> 00:18:44.68 run down animals and a slip.
00:18:44.68 --> 00:18:46.32 And this is one of those things you got to look this up.
00:18:46.32 --> 00:18:47.16 I didn't know this.
00:18:47.16 --> 00:18:49.36 I looked it up today.
00:18:49.36 --> 00:18:55.96 A slip is an old kind of leech that they used for hunting dogs that when you, it was
00:18:55.96 --> 00:19:00.16 very, you could, you could basically hit a switch and it would let the dog go.
00:19:00.16 --> 00:19:04.24 So here are these picture these gray hounds that are in these quick release leaches,
00:19:04.24 --> 00:19:11.08 but they're straining on them, waiting to go on the hunt to go and chase down their prey.
00:19:11.08 --> 00:19:18.72 And the next line is the games of foot follow your spirit and upon this charge, cry,
00:19:18.72 --> 00:19:21.80 God for Harry, England and St. George.
00:19:21.80 --> 00:19:28.48 So he says the game is a foot meaning the animal that you're hunting, it's out there.
00:19:28.48 --> 00:19:38.68 Follow your spirit and then go and get after it and as you get after it, yell God for
00:19:38.68 --> 00:19:44.96 Harry, England and St. George and St. George is the patron saint of England, the dragon
00:19:44.96 --> 00:19:52.48 and slayer who was an executed Christian murder.
00:19:52.48 --> 00:20:05.12 So you can see that there's so much inside these words and he captures some of the brutality
00:20:05.12 --> 00:20:07.68 of war.
00:20:07.68 --> 00:20:13.64 And so what happens now is they get the village that they're trying to take down and
00:20:13.64 --> 00:20:17.88 they've put a lot of pressure on, they've gone through the breach, they've gotten
00:20:17.88 --> 00:20:29.36 foot back, but now they've gone along a lock down and he's telling them, he tells the
00:20:29.36 --> 00:20:41.64 governor that he needs to surrender before Henry loses control of his own men.
00:20:41.64 --> 00:20:45.32 This is a scary thing, this is like, hey, if you don't surrender now, I'm not going to
00:20:45.32 --> 00:20:47.72 have control anymore over these guys.
00:20:47.72 --> 00:20:51.16 These barbarians at the gate, they're going to come and I'm not going to have control over
00:20:51.16 --> 00:20:53.28 them anymore.
00:20:53.28 --> 00:21:02.12 He says the gates of mercy shall be all shut up and the fleshed soldier, rough and hard
00:21:02.12 --> 00:21:04.72 of heart and by the way, fleshed.
00:21:04.72 --> 00:21:09.52 This is an old word, it means excited by the taste of flesh.
00:21:09.52 --> 00:21:16.52 So he's saying these soldiers who are excited by the taste of flesh in liberty of bloody
00:21:16.52 --> 00:21:22.76 hand shall range with conscience wide as hell.
00:21:22.76 --> 00:21:25.44 So in liberty of bloody hand, you know what that means?
00:21:25.44 --> 00:21:27.96 It means our hands are already covered in blood.
00:21:27.96 --> 00:21:31.20 I'm just going to go forward, I don't care anymore.
00:21:31.20 --> 00:21:35.76 I don't care anymore.
00:21:35.76 --> 00:21:43.36 The conscious wide is hell, mowing like grass, your fresh fair virgins and your flowering
00:21:43.36 --> 00:21:46.000 infants.
00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:55.000 So we are going to come and we are going to mow like grass.
00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:56.64 Your virgins and your children.
00:21:56.64 --> 00:21:59.36 That's that, it's right.
00:21:59.36 --> 00:22:02.44 He goes on trying to convince them.
00:22:02.44 --> 00:22:07.48 Again, this is his key point is like, listen, I've control these guys right now.
00:22:07.48 --> 00:22:08.48 And he goes on.
00:22:08.48 --> 00:22:14.84 Therefore, you men of harfler take pity on your town and of your people.
00:22:14.84 --> 00:22:23.92 Whilst yet my soldiers are in my command, whilst yet the cool and temperate's wind of grace
00:22:23.92 --> 00:22:33.04 all blows the filthy and contagious clouds of heavy, murder, spoil and villainy.
00:22:33.04 --> 00:22:39.52 So he's saying like, right now there's a cool breeze of peace and grace with my guys,
00:22:39.52 --> 00:22:47.24 but some contagious clouds are coming of murder and spoil and villainy.
00:22:47.24 --> 00:22:51.88 And the word to use is heavy is it means intoxicating.
00:22:51.88 --> 00:22:57.96 Meaning these guys are going to lose their minds.
00:22:57.96 --> 00:23:06.44 If not, why in a moment look to see the blind and bloody soldier with foul hand, desire
00:23:06.44 --> 00:23:10.64 the locks of your shrivel, shrieking daughters.
00:23:10.64 --> 00:23:20.64 Your fathers taken by the silver beards and their most reverend heads dash to the walls.
00:23:20.64 --> 00:23:24.60 And he's saying, I'm blind and bloody soldier, and I'm blind with rage and blind with
00:23:24.60 --> 00:23:30.72 murder and foul handsies telling them this.
00:23:30.72 --> 00:23:45.04 Your naked infants spitted upon pikes and spitted by the way is a methodology used in this
00:23:45.04 --> 00:23:50.56 time period for cooking small games, small animals and it means you put the animal on a pole
00:23:50.56 --> 00:23:59.000 from mouth to rectum and he's saying they're going to do this to their children.
00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:07.000 Wals the mad mothers with their house confused to break the clouds as did the wives of
00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:15.20 Juliet at herds bloody hunting slaughtermen. So break the clouds. That means cries so the mad
00:24:15.20 --> 00:24:20.44 mothers are going to go mad with tears.
00:24:20.44 --> 00:24:25.96 Like they did in the Bible in Matthew 216, that's what this is referring to when King
00:24:25.96 --> 00:24:32.36 Herred ordered the slaughter of all boys under the age of two and Bethlehem.
00:24:32.36 --> 00:24:36.12 This is like a threat that they're going to kill all the children.
00:24:36.12 --> 00:24:40.76 So Henry the fifth is bringing it.
00:24:40.76 --> 00:24:43.000 What say you?
00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:53.04 Will you yield and of this avoid or guilty in defense be thus destroyed?
00:24:53.04 --> 00:25:01.48 So the French hearing these pretty valid threats coming.
00:25:01.48 --> 00:25:09.68 They surrender. Henry and the troops take that village and then the next thing they do
00:25:09.68 --> 00:25:16.16 is march and again, moving rapidly through a real war that took place.
00:25:16.16 --> 00:25:24.80 And they end up settling on the opposing ends of a field which is now what becomes the
00:25:24.80 --> 00:25:31.80 famous battle of some people call as in court or as in court.
00:25:31.80 --> 00:25:37.16 And the French, they got more people.
00:25:37.16 --> 00:25:43.04 I mean it's in France. So they've got more people substantially more people and there's
00:25:43.04 --> 00:25:47.60 a bunch of different, you know, the books I've read, there's varying numbers, but they definitely
00:25:47.60 --> 00:25:56.96 had substantially more people. And Henry, he's talking to some of his leadership, his
00:25:56.96 --> 00:26:02.000 subordinate commanders and then they all kind of walk off the stage and he's left there
00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:07.92 and he starts talking a little bit about the burden of command and some thoughts on leadership
00:26:07.92 --> 00:26:14.20 which I was I found very familiar.
00:26:14.20 --> 00:26:23.40 So he says, upon the king, let us our lives, our souls, our debts, our careful wives, our
00:26:23.40 --> 00:26:32.12 children and our sins lay on the king. We must bear all.
00:26:32.12 --> 00:26:35.92 So he knows that the king is responsible for everything.
00:26:35.92 --> 00:26:49.92 Got to take ownership of everything. And he kind of talks about this idea that the king is,
00:26:49.92 --> 00:26:55.000 you know, it's the expression of it's lonely at the top. He's about to get into that.
00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:58.24 And whatever it was, 15, 99.
00:26:58.24 --> 00:27:06.16 Oh, ceremony, show me but I worth. What is that soul of adoration? Art thou ought else but
00:27:06.16 --> 00:27:12.24 place degree and form? So he's saying like, what is all this junk besides just social
00:27:12.24 --> 00:27:19.04 rank and etiquette? What real meaning does it have? Creating awe and fear in other men,
00:27:19.04 --> 00:27:26.000 where in thou art less happy being feared than they in fearing? So he's saying, look,
00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:32.24 like these people are scared of me. I'm I'm actually less happy than they are. They're afraid
00:27:32.24 --> 00:27:40.80 of me, but I'm less happy because I'm the guy that's scaring them. I am a king that find the
00:27:40.80 --> 00:27:48.56 and I know, it is not the bomb, the septer and the ball, the sword, the mace, the crown imperial,
00:27:48.56 --> 00:27:54.48 the inter-tissued robe of gold and pearl, the first title running for the king.
00:27:54.48 --> 00:28:01.84 The throne he sits on, nor the tide of pomp that beats upon the high shore of this world. So
00:28:01.84 --> 00:28:07.44 he goes through all the kind of stereotypical things that make you a king. You know, the clothes,
00:28:07.44 --> 00:28:17.12 the septer, the crown, all those things. No, not all these, thrice, gorgeous ceremony, not all
00:28:17.12 --> 00:28:25.60 these, laid in bed majestical. So not any of those beautiful things, expensive things,
00:28:25.92 --> 00:28:38.000 can sleep so soundly as the wretched slave. So it's the slave who, with a body filled and vacant mind,
00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:48.72 gets him to rest crammed with distressful bread. So he's talking about this fact that the king
00:28:50.48 --> 00:28:54.24 doesn't get to rest, doesn't get to sleep when the slave goes home at night. He's going to eat
00:28:54.24 --> 00:28:57.92 the fed and distressful basically that means that they made it themselves. They made it with
00:28:57.92 --> 00:29:02.32 their own hands. They actually get some satisfaction of making their food and eating it.
00:29:02.88 --> 00:29:07.84 He's even get that satisfaction. His mind is constantly churning about the fate of the
00:29:07.84 --> 00:29:14.96 kingdom. And it's actually, interestingly, when I was in, I know we did a podcast here about Sri Lanka,
00:29:14.96 --> 00:29:19.60 and I talked about me being in Sri Lanka. And I tried to drag it because again, I'd never been in
00:29:19.60 --> 00:29:25.76 combat. This is the mid-90s. And I tried to drag as much knowledge as I could out of the Sri
00:29:25.76 --> 00:29:31.20 Lankan guys, the Sri Lankan military, the Sri Lankan special boat service and the special forces
00:29:31.20 --> 00:29:36.56 guys that we were working with and they were unbelievably combat experienced veterans.
00:29:36.56 --> 00:29:45.04 But one of the guys that I befriended who is an army captain and his, he was one of those guys who
00:29:45.04 --> 00:29:52.16 is a guy that was a good leader. But man, he felt exactly what this guy, what Henry the fifth is talking
00:29:52.16 --> 00:29:57.04 about here. And I remember him saying, you know, he's kind of just having a late night conversation
00:29:57.04 --> 00:30:02.16 with me because like I said, I was constantly trying to garner information from these guys and
00:30:02.16 --> 00:30:07.60 learn from them. And you know, he, because this guy had been at this guy had been a regular soldier.
00:30:08.16 --> 00:30:12.40 And then he had been promoted, he'd gone up the ranks. And he said, you know, Jarko,
00:30:13.68 --> 00:30:19.20 when I was a soldier, meaning when he was just a grunt soldier, I'm, you know, lower and
00:30:19.20 --> 00:30:25.92 listed guy, he said, I knew I could survive anything. And I knew I could take care of myself.
00:30:25.92 --> 00:30:33.60 And it was actually kind of fun. And he said, now that I'm a company commander because now he
00:30:33.60 --> 00:30:41.76 was actually pretty senior guy, he said, it is the most stress and it is the most harrowing thing,
00:30:41.76 --> 00:30:46.16 because I'm not worried about myself anymore. But I'm so worried about all these other guys.
00:30:46.16 --> 00:30:58.16 That's what the worry is. And yeah, I actually got to know that feeling myself. The leader gets
00:30:58.16 --> 00:31:02.80 no rest and what Henry's talking about is that burden of command. And that's the same thing that
00:31:02.80 --> 00:31:07.84 Sri Lanka guy was talking about. You hear me talking about it as well. You know, that burden of
00:31:07.84 --> 00:31:17.92 command is heavy. And now, so now, you know, again, I've kind of gone very quickly through
00:31:19.04 --> 00:31:26.48 what this to get to this point where where Henry the fifth makes this famous speech. And as I
00:31:26.48 --> 00:31:29.92 said, the English are on one side of the battlefield in the French. The other, again, this really happened.
00:31:29.92 --> 00:31:36.88 This is this is factual information. And they can hear each other and they can at night, they see
00:31:36.88 --> 00:31:42.64 each other's campfire burning and the English, like I said, they know they're outnumbered. And finally,
00:31:42.64 --> 00:31:46.32 one of the leaders, you know, as they're as they're getting ready to go and come about one of the
00:31:46.32 --> 00:31:53.36 leaders from the British side, he calls out kind of like wishing that they add more men. And it's
00:31:53.36 --> 00:32:00.16 interesting and it's pretty important to know that, I mean, obviously Shakespeare fictionalized
00:32:00.16 --> 00:32:08.40 this in many ways, but that speech is actually rooted in a real account. It's rooted in a real account
00:32:08.80 --> 00:32:16.32 of something that was said. And, and the account was written by an anonymous chaplain that was like
00:32:16.32 --> 00:32:23.52 on tour with these guys. And he just wrote down what he saw. And in his report, it was the a guy named
00:32:23.52 --> 00:32:29.52 Sir Walter Hungerford that suggested to the king that it would be nice if they had another
00:32:29.52 --> 00:32:33.12 10,000 archers from England that were not doing anything, you know, that are sitting back,
00:32:33.12 --> 00:32:36.80 doing, you know, back in England, sitting in peace and it'd be nice if they had them there.
00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:43.12 But now in the play, it's a character named Westmoreland, who's one of, you know, the, the
00:32:43.12 --> 00:32:52.96 lieutenant's or the one of the subordinate leadership of Henry V. And he says, oh, that we now had here,
00:32:52.96 --> 00:33:00.08 but one 10,000 of those men in England that do know work today. So he's saying that same thing,
00:33:00.08 --> 00:33:06.08 he's like, listen, here we are about to go to battle, work completely outnumbered and
00:33:09.04 --> 00:33:12.24 be nice if we had some of those other guys that are in England right now that are sitting in bed
00:33:12.24 --> 00:33:20.56 they're doing nothing. And so, so now King Henry responds. And again, this is this is in the same
00:33:20.56 --> 00:33:25.04 vein that was documented by this synonymous chaplain. And of course, Shakespeare wrote it,
00:33:25.04 --> 00:33:31.52 so it's got to be, it's a lot more impactful, but the message is the same. And I'm going to go through
00:33:31.52 --> 00:33:37.52 this once and kind of break it down. So so that we can understand what the meaning of these different
00:33:37.52 --> 00:33:44.96 words are before I just roll through it. So when he said, you know, this guy says, you know,
00:33:44.96 --> 00:33:53.36 if only we had more guys. And King Henry says, what's he that wishes? So meaning who just said that?
00:33:54.08 --> 00:34:02.96 Said, my cousin West Moorland, know my fair cousin. If we are marked to die, we are enough to do
00:34:02.96 --> 00:34:12.40 our country loss. And if to live the fewer men, the greater share of honor. So we say, no,
00:34:12.40 --> 00:34:18.000 listen, if we're going to die, we got plenty of guys here to die for our country. But if we're
00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:23.92 going to live and if we're going to win, the fewer men we have, the better, because that's more
00:34:23.92 --> 00:34:37.12 honor for us. God's will, I pray the wish not one more man is one anybody else. By Jov, I am not
00:34:37.12 --> 00:34:44.80 covetous for gold nor care I who defeat upon my cost. So he doesn't care about gold. He doesn't care
00:34:44.80 --> 00:34:53.68 who he feeds and who eats off of his check that he's cashin. It earns me not if my men, my garments
00:34:53.68 --> 00:34:58.24 wear, meaning he isn't people. He doesn't care if people are either taking his clothes or if they're
00:34:58.24 --> 00:35:05.52 wearing his real colors. It doesn't care about any of that. Such outward things dwell not in my desires.
00:35:05.52 --> 00:35:16.96 Those things don't matter to him. But if it, if it be a sin to covet honor, I am the most
00:35:16.96 --> 00:35:27.04 offending soul alive. So if it's about honor and if it's a sin to want honor and want glory,
00:35:27.04 --> 00:35:34.24 then he's the guiltyest person of them all. No faith, my cause, wish not a man from England.
00:35:34.24 --> 00:35:42.40 God's peace, I would not lose so great in honor as one more man. Me thinks would share from me
00:35:42.40 --> 00:35:49.44 for the best hope I have. Oh, do not wish one more. So he's just going off like no, we don't want
00:35:49.44 --> 00:35:57.84 anyone else. I don't want to share my honor with anyone else. Rather, proclaim it, Westmoreland,
00:35:57.84 --> 00:36:06.32 through my host that he which half know stomach to this fight let him depart. His passport shall
00:36:06.32 --> 00:36:14.000 be made and crowns for convoy put into his purse. So he's okay, you know what, Westmoreland?
00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:22.16 As a matter of fact, tell everyone that anybody that doesn't have the guts or the stomach to
00:36:22.16 --> 00:36:31.36 stand here with us and fight, tell them, I'll give them a passport and I'll give them money to pay
00:36:31.36 --> 00:36:40.16 for their trip home. We would not die in that man's company that theorist is fellowship to die with us.
00:36:42.48 --> 00:36:47.84 He's one of die with anybody that fears the duty, that's what they mean by fellowship,
00:36:47.84 --> 00:36:57.76 the duty to die with us. This day is called the Feast of Crispy and so Crispy and
00:36:58.56 --> 00:37:06.32 this is actually a legit twin brothers. Interestingly, Crispy and Crispy and Twin Brothers,
00:37:06.32 --> 00:37:13.28 they helped the poor and they preached Christianity and they were tortured by a Roman governor
00:37:13.28 --> 00:37:19.36 and they were thrown into the river with millstones tied around their necks and they survived
00:37:20.08 --> 00:37:23.44 and when they survived that they pulled them out of the water and they beheaded them.
00:37:25.60 --> 00:37:30.64 They were venerated and they became saints on October 25th and that's called St. Crispy and
00:37:30.64 --> 00:37:38.16 today, sometimes it's called St. Crispy and today, but that's what it is. So this day, this is October 25th
00:37:38.16 --> 00:37:44.96 when they're about to fight. He says this day is called the Feast of Crispy and he that out lives
00:37:44.96 --> 00:37:52.000 this day and comes home safe will stand a tiptoe when the day is named and rouse him at the name of
00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:57.76 Crispy and so anybody that anybody that lives through this day and comes home safe when it's going to
00:37:57.76 --> 00:38:02.16 be St. Crispy and today they're going to get on their toes they're going to be so excited about it.
00:38:02.16 --> 00:38:11.60 He that she'll see this day and live all day, he'll yearly on the video feast his neighbors and say
00:38:12.40 --> 00:38:17.76 tomorrow is Saint Crispy and so again anyway that lives through this is going to be going to
00:38:17.76 --> 00:38:26.96 their neighbors and say, tomorrow Saint Crispy and today then will he strip his sleeve and show
00:38:26.96 --> 00:38:34.96 his scars and say these wounds I had on Crispy's day. So he's going to be at their feast he's going
00:38:34.96 --> 00:38:39.52 to roll up his sleeves and he's going to say, you see these scars? These are what I got on Crispy's day.
00:38:41.52 --> 00:38:51.52 Old men forget yet all shall be forgot but he'll remember with advantages what feats he did that
00:38:51.52 --> 00:38:58.24 day so he's saying everything gets forgot right but the old man will remember the glory days of that
00:38:58.24 --> 00:39:03.04 battle and what he did it will be the highlight of his life.
00:39:06.88 --> 00:39:14.64 Then our names familiar in his mouth as household words, Harry the King, bedford and exeter,
00:39:14.64 --> 00:39:21.84 warric and Talbot, Salisbury and Gloucester be in their flowing cups freshly remembered.
00:39:23.28 --> 00:39:26.96 So all their names are going to be remembered.
00:39:29.84 --> 00:39:37.04 This story shall the good man teaches son and Crispy and Crispy and shall narrow go by from this
00:39:37.04 --> 00:39:42.000 day to the ending of the world but we in it shall be remembered.
00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:51.04 So we say, look, this is a story that good men are going to tell their sons and they're going
00:39:51.04 --> 00:39:55.92 for ever remember on this day to the ending of the world what we did.
00:39:59.12 --> 00:40:07.28 We few, we happy few, we band a brothers for he today that sheds his blood with me shall be my brother.
00:40:07.28 --> 00:40:18.48 And that one doesn't really need an explanation but we sure do hear about brotherhood a lot.
00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:29.20 Be he near so vile this day shall gentle his condition so no matter where you're from,
00:40:29.20 --> 00:40:35.44 no matter what you were like, no matter what kind of a person you were today when he says gentle
00:40:35.44 --> 00:40:39.84 his condition that today will make you a gentleman today will make you a man.
00:40:43.12 --> 00:40:48.72 And gentle men in England now are bed so guys that are back in England right now sleeping
00:40:48.72 --> 00:40:56.96 shall think themselves are cursed they were not here and hold their manhoods cheap whilst any
00:40:56.96 --> 00:41:05.84 speaks that fought with us upon St. Crispin's day. So like I said, anyone that's home in England
00:41:05.84 --> 00:41:11.36 and that word of bed it's like implies being lazy and sleeping they're going to curse that they
00:41:11.36 --> 00:41:17.68 weren't there and they'll know that they weren't real men and I mean he used the word manhood
00:41:19.20 --> 00:41:26.80 which implies you know, testicular fortitude they didn't have the testicular fortitude to fight
00:41:26.80 --> 00:41:39.12 and that's that's the speech with the understanding and I haven't even gone all the way.
00:41:39.12 --> 00:41:45.68 I mean I didn't go to break down each and every word and the depth and meaning behind them because
00:41:45.68 --> 00:41:57.44 they are so impactful. And if you go when you read you can get like a translated modern version
00:41:59.60 --> 00:42:06.48 that kind of dumps down the language and that's okay but I'm telling you having done both when you do that
00:42:06.48 --> 00:42:14.08 that's like compared to actually doing the work and studying and figuring out what it all actually
00:42:14.08 --> 00:42:21.68 means if you just take a dumb-down version it's like diet Shakespeare or Shakespeare right it's
00:42:21.68 --> 00:42:28.56 it's actually worse than that it's like firing a cap gun versus firing a real gun it kind of looks
00:42:28.56 --> 00:42:33.36 the same and it might even sound a little bit the same but one of them will kill you and the other
00:42:33.36 --> 00:42:40.24 one just goes bang you know it's not as heavy and what's really bizarre and this is I think
00:42:40.24 --> 00:42:52.48 actually this is really strange if you go on YouTube and you look up Henry the fifth
00:42:52.48 --> 00:42:58.88 St. Crispin's Day speech right if you look it up you'll get these classically trained actors
00:42:58.88 --> 00:43:16.88 famous I mean famous actors doing this speech and in my mind they don't get it they don't get it
00:43:16.88 --> 00:43:22.32 right and I you know what I know I'm a nobody I know I'm just some guy and these people
00:43:22.32 --> 00:43:31.04 a lot of people at study Shakespeare and did it on stage and all of a sudden I'm just an ignorant
00:43:31.04 --> 00:43:34.64 you know rich from the trenches and I don't understand I am a pentameter and all the other little
00:43:34.64 --> 00:43:43.28 details but I'm telling you I don't think they get it and when I watch the professionals do this
00:43:44.16 --> 00:43:49.28 I don't think they get the emotion I don't think they understand the leadership I don't think they
00:43:49.28 --> 00:43:55.92 get the fear and the blood and the death and I don't think they understand war
00:44:00.56 --> 00:44:10.000 and when these actors take these great words that are crafted brilliantly
00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:20.64 and they try and say them like leaders to me they still sound like actors they don't sound
00:44:20.64 --> 00:44:24.80 like men that have fathered and don't sound like men that have seen battle they definitely
00:44:24.80 --> 00:44:33.60 don't sound like men that have seen war I think Henry the fifth would have sounded different
00:44:33.60 --> 00:44:48.64 this is what I think would be closer to what Henry the fifth a combat leader would have sounded
00:44:48.64 --> 00:44:56.40 like as he as he answered some one of his subordinate leaders out there in the crowd saying
00:44:56.40 --> 00:45:05.92 that we need more people we need more men I think this is what he would have sounded like
00:45:05.04 --> 00:45:16.40 what's he that wishes so my cousin was moreland know my fair cousin if we are marked to die
00:45:16.40 --> 00:45:23.76 we are enough to do our country loss and if to live the few men the greater share of honor
00:45:23.76 --> 00:45:35.44 God's will I pray the wish not one more man by jove I am not covetous for gold nor
00:45:35.44 --> 00:45:43.44 cari who do our feet upon my cost it earns me not if men my garments wear such outward
00:45:43.44 --> 00:45:55.52 things to well not my desires but if it be a sin to covet honor I am the most defending soul
00:45:55.52 --> 00:46:05.60 alive no faith my cousin wish not a man from England God's peace I would not lose so great
00:46:05.60 --> 00:46:15.12 and honor as one man more me thinks would share for me for the best hope I have oh do not wish one more
00:46:17.12 --> 00:46:25.44 rather proclaim it west moreland for my host that he which has no stomach to this fight let
00:46:25.44 --> 00:46:31.84 him depart his passport shall be made and crowns for convoy shall be put into his purse
00:46:31.84 --> 00:46:40.64 we would not die in that man's company that fears his fellowship to die with us
00:46:44.08 --> 00:46:51.84 this day is called the feast of crispy and leave that out lives this day and it comes home safe
00:46:51.84 --> 00:46:57.84 will stand a tiptoe when the day is named and rouse him at the name of crispy and
00:46:57.84 --> 00:47:07.12 he that shall see this day and live old age will yearly on the video feast his neighbors and say
00:47:07.12 --> 00:47:16.88 tomorrow is Saint Crispian then will he strip his sleeve and show his scars and say these wounds
00:47:16.88 --> 00:47:31.52 I had on crispy and stay old men forget yet all shall be forgot but he'll remember with advantages
00:47:31.52 --> 00:47:42.08 what feats he did that day then shall our names familiar in his mouth as household words
00:47:42.08 --> 00:47:47.44 hairy the king bedford next to her warwick and talbot salsbury and claustar
00:47:48.48 --> 00:47:51.44 being there flowing cups freshly remembered
00:47:55.68 --> 00:48:04.000 this story shall the good man teaches son and crispy and crispy and shall narrow go by
00:48:04.80 --> 00:48:09.44 from this day to the ending of the world but we in it shall be remembered
00:48:09.44 --> 00:48:22.72 we have a few we have a few we bend of brothers for who for he today that shed his blood with
00:48:22.72 --> 00:48:30.56 me shall be my brother be he near so vile this day shall gentle his condition
00:48:32.72 --> 00:48:39.04 and gentleman in England now a bed shall think themselves a curse that they were not here
00:48:39.04 --> 00:48:47.52 and hold their manhoods cheap while any speaks that fought with us upon Saint Crispian's day
00:48:54.96 --> 00:49:02.32 now that is a speech and that is like I said there's a lot more
00:49:02.32 --> 00:49:12.40 to it than what I covered there's so much depth there and that's why it's lasted the ages
00:49:12.40 --> 00:49:16.88 and that's why you hear people talking about brotherhood and this is what they refer to
00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:27.84 and as far as Shakespeare goes and I talk all the time about getting stronger and faster and getting
00:49:27.84 --> 00:49:39.84 smarter and stronger and faster that's I mean that's pretty straightforward how do you get
00:49:39.84 --> 00:49:45.12 stronger faster you let weights you work out you do your calisthenics you do physical
00:49:45.12 --> 00:49:53.20 activity to get stronger and faster but how do you get smarter well this is a one way to get
00:49:53.20 --> 00:50:01.44 smarter you go out and you find something that you do not understand and you gain understanding of it
00:50:03.20 --> 00:50:09.60 words you don't know and phrases you don't know and concepts you don't know you find them
00:50:09.60 --> 00:50:13.84 and you learn them you teach yourself the resources are there
00:50:13.84 --> 00:50:27.20 and by the way you know what it's free there's no gym fees there's no equipment to buy
00:50:28.64 --> 00:50:33.60 you can get all of Shakespeare his entire canon on the internet for free
00:50:33.60 --> 00:50:43.36 hmm it's at the library for free the only thing it does take and the only thing it does
00:50:43.36 --> 00:50:48.80 cost is just a little something that we call discipline right to get in there to open that book to
00:50:48.80 --> 00:51:04.08 challenge your brain in order to free your mind so that's Shakespeare that's Henry the fifth and
00:51:05.84 --> 00:51:16.16 very impactful and definitely a classic representation of the band of brothers that I had the honor
00:51:16.16 --> 00:51:30.48 to work with in Ramadi I rack in 2006 the first the five oh six and I guess it is time
00:51:31.84 --> 00:51:39.76 for questions from the interwebs and speaking of the interwebs

00:56:20.08 --> 00:56:28.80 dot com jockelpodcast dot com alright in on it on it on it on it on it on it on it on it on it on the
00:56:28.80 --> 00:56:37.44 down for a few seconds thank you all right internet questions first question kind of the paragraph
00:56:37.44 --> 00:56:43.28 with the question yeah we got some long questions jockel i'm just curious about your opinions on the
00:56:43.28 --> 00:56:49.44 regular army infantry. It seems like nowadays the regular infantry is almost looked down upon
00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:56.80 from the regular public and every prior military public speaker. I almost feel like we're looked at
00:56:57.60 --> 00:57:02.64 like we were just bodies that held ground and absorbed attacks and made no real impact on the war.
00:57:03.60 --> 00:57:09.04 I'm almost hesitant to ask because I'm not sure if I can or I'm not sure if I'm in denial
00:57:09.04 --> 00:57:14.96 or if it's just pride. I served with some fantastic warriors and I don't want those heroes to be looked
00:57:14.96 --> 00:57:21.84 over in history because they were regular gruts. So I'd enjoy your opinions on this matter and if you
00:57:21.84 --> 00:57:27.68 could enlighten me on how infantry divisions are looked at from other groups and organizations.
00:57:27.68 --> 00:57:42.64 Yeah, this question, you know, it bothers me. It bothers me because if you couldn't tell
00:57:42.64 --> 00:57:47.36 from the opening that I did tonight, talk about the first of the 506, I would tell you the
00:57:47.36 --> 00:57:56.16 same thing about so many other units that we have the utmost respect and admiration for what we used to
00:57:56.16 --> 00:58:01.28 call conventional for forces with an alcohol general purpose forces, but it's the Marine Corps,
00:58:01.28 --> 00:58:06.08 the US Marine Corps, the US Army, they're regular infantry at a ground pattern, they're grunts.
00:58:07.44 --> 00:58:16.64 And we, like I said, the guys in my task, the guys in home to suit teams, we have nothing but
00:58:16.64 --> 00:58:23.44 respect and admiration for the ground pounders for the grunts. And for my position, you know,
00:58:23.44 --> 00:58:27.92 have been a Romani with the 228, which was a reserve unit offensive land unit iron soldiers.
00:58:27.92 --> 00:58:33.44 Those guys were outstanding, outstanding. And then they turned over with the 118 and you've
00:58:33.44 --> 00:58:38.32 heard me talk about them and the battalions that were attached to them. Those guys were just
00:58:39.76 --> 00:58:46.96 all of them. I mean, they were just so professional, so brave. And of course, special forces and
00:58:46.96 --> 00:58:54.80 seals and Rangers and Marsock and Afsock for whatever reason, special operations gets attention.
00:58:54.80 --> 00:59:01.52 I mean, the name is special operations. So it gets this attention. I'm not 100% sure where it comes
00:59:01.52 --> 00:59:06.88 from or where it's started or whatever, but there's something about the public and the media,
00:59:08.88 --> 00:59:14.72 and I don't know, the media feeds the public and the food, the public feeds the media,
00:59:14.72 --> 00:59:19.68 the media feeds the public. So like the public wants to see stories. So the media produces stories
00:59:19.68 --> 00:59:24.80 about the special operations types. And then it goes into a vision circle, a vicious circle,
00:59:24.80 --> 00:59:29.60 and they just make a bunch of new stories about it. And so, you know, it's like this little
00:59:30.64 --> 00:59:36.80 mistake or whatever of special operations, probably that's that's that's having that impact.
00:59:37.68 --> 00:59:42.40 But let me tell you, just for everybody, for anyone that's on that's not been in the military,
00:59:42.40 --> 00:59:46.88 that has that, you know, things, the special operations guys must be more, you know,
00:59:46.88 --> 00:59:53.36 elite or do more dangerous stuff wrong, wrong. Do they do dangerous stuff? Yes.
00:59:54.16 --> 00:59:59.12 But, you know, I've been all, and when I was in Iraq, my first diploma to Iraq went all over Iraq.
01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:06.32 It's spec second to diploma, stayed in the Romadi, but I, during that time saw the conventional
01:00:06.32 --> 01:00:10.08 units, the general purpose forces, the ground pounders, the grunts, the Marine Corps,
01:00:10.08 --> 01:00:15.60 and not just them, but I talked about this last time, the logistics folks, I mean,
01:00:15.60 --> 01:00:18.88 so it's everybody, they're out there, they're living in forward operating bases.
01:00:18.88 --> 01:00:23.68 They're living in combat outposts in the middle of cities, you know, small groups out there,
01:00:23.68 --> 01:00:30.32 eating MREs, just living in really tough conditions, doing daytime patrols and horrible
01:00:30.32 --> 01:00:36.08 areas, working with Iraqi soldiers. You know, like I just said, doing these logistics runs,
01:00:36.08 --> 01:00:40.56 you know, these are where you get blown up with an ID, these are where you get an ambushed. I mean,
01:00:40.56 --> 01:00:44.72 this is what they did all the time. Every day, this was their job, even like the mine clearance
01:00:44.72 --> 01:00:50.16 operations, you know, you're going out and you're going out to go and get blown up or try and
01:00:50.16 --> 01:00:54.000 look for things that are going to blow you up. And, you know, first, sure, you got some guys that
01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:57.52 are in the big, mind protected vehicles, but when we were in Romadi, there was a Marine Corps unit
01:00:57.52 --> 01:01:00.000 that would fall behind those guys sometimes in our meeting, they would fall behind those guys,
01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:03.76 they're just going to pray, and for tree guys, just out there, get an after it. And so,
01:01:03.76 --> 01:01:14.32 what do we think of that? I mean, I have just admiration, respect, and just utmost, the utmost,
01:01:14.32 --> 01:01:21.52 I hold those guys in the highest esteem because they held the line. So to that guy, the out there
01:01:21.52 --> 01:01:26.88 that asked that question, believe me, anybody that's been in combat and knows what you guys do.
01:01:26.88 --> 01:01:31.04 And I spread that word all the time, you listen to any, even if you read, if you read
01:01:31.04 --> 01:01:36.72 Lavinized book, I mean, we talked about that in great detail about the respect and admiration we had
01:01:36.72 --> 01:01:42.08 for for the general purpose forces, the grunts, the ground pounders, the bravest,
01:01:42.96 --> 01:01:51.04 the most professional and most dedicated people that I could ever imagine. And I was absolutely
01:01:51.04 --> 01:01:58.96 honored and everyone in my seal task unit was honored and humbled to have served with such
01:01:58.96 --> 01:02:04.72 brave warriors. So that's how I feel about our US military.
01:02:09.12 --> 01:02:19.92 Next question. So, Jockel posted a Twitter post, Instagram, Twitter and Instagram post
01:02:19.92 --> 01:02:25.60 of a picture black and white, strangely, and sort of a gig. Yeah, you think.
01:02:25.60 --> 01:02:31.20 Um, of just the mats and I think there's some ambiguous figures of his dean right
01:02:31.20 --> 01:02:37.68 teaching somebody. Anyway, he said, talked about he learned the lesson or something like that.
01:02:37.68 --> 01:02:42.24 Anyway, so the question is, Jockel, what lesson did you learn for the thousandth time?
01:02:42.24 --> 01:02:47.28 Because he said, he said that. It was. In training with dean the other day. So what was that?
01:02:47.28 --> 01:02:53.92 The lesson was rules, rules must sometimes be broken. So let me, let me give you the quick story
01:02:53.92 --> 01:03:00.40 for the philosophy that our Jitu players will indulge you a little bit with some Jitu. So Friday,
01:03:01.04 --> 01:03:07.28 night training, and dean, I usually train hard on Friday nights. And we had, uh, we had a war.
01:03:07.28 --> 01:03:12.80 We had a little death match on Friday. And it started off. We would have probably, I don't know,
01:03:12.80 --> 01:03:18.000 five, six, maybe seven minutes. And he got me, got me in a little, uh, got me in a little situation
01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:25.04 that forced me to submit. And then we, we also had a let's go again. And so we went again. And I,
01:03:25.04 --> 01:03:32.40 and I warmed down and I got the better of him. And actually, the, the deeper water I take him into,
01:03:32.40 --> 01:03:39.68 the better things get from me, right? So I warmed down and I got a hold of his arm.
01:03:39.68 --> 01:03:48.32 And I had him in a, I had him in a compromised position for probably five minutes. And,
01:03:49.68 --> 01:03:56.48 you know, he, and he at the last moments, good, great timing. And he just got out,
01:03:56.48 --> 01:04:03.04 Armbar. It was a straight arm walking. And, uh, so he got out and we got out. He was done. He was like,
01:04:03.04 --> 01:04:08.88 yeah, I'm done. I mean, he got out of it, but he was done. So Jocco got a little moral victory, right?
01:04:08.88 --> 01:04:14.16 And then I kind of antagonized him a little bit, which is what Dean and I do. We, we instigate and we
01:04:14.16 --> 01:04:18.56 antagonize each other. And so I antagonized him a little bit about, you know, you know, you don't want to
01:04:18.56 --> 01:04:22.96 train anymore. Oh, could you two, you're too broken down. You know, I'm going to stay here and train more.
01:04:23.52 --> 01:04:28.16 You can go home and, you know, have a glass of warm milk or whatever. You're going to just give him a hard time.
01:04:28.80 --> 01:04:35.68 So, so, you know, inside, and I failed to recognize us inside psychologically, he was, he was not happy
01:04:35.68 --> 01:04:43.28 about that. And so Saturday, he's like, hey, you know, let's train. And so I missed that. I missed that.
01:04:43.28 --> 01:04:48.48 It's a cue. That's a red flag. So when I showed up, you know, he says, oh, you know, let's just
01:04:48.48 --> 01:04:53.68 work some moves and we, we went over some stuff and working some other people. And, you know,
01:04:53.68 --> 01:04:58.24 we're just kind of very relaxed laid back. There was no class going on. We're just just relaxing.
01:04:59.52 --> 01:05:03.92 And I said, hey, man, I got to leave it such as such a time. I go pick one of my kids up. He
01:05:03.92 --> 01:05:07.44 goes, yeah, yeah, no problem. He goes, I got to leave too. So now I think he's got to leave. So I'm actually
01:05:07.44 --> 01:05:11.68 thinking, we're, we might get a light roll. That'll be it. You know, maybe like two, five minute rounds.
01:05:12.96 --> 01:05:17.20 So, and he's got the, you know, the nice guy phase and all that stuff that he's given me.
01:05:18.16 --> 01:05:23.76 So anyways, I said, you know, we work on stuff. And he says, all right, let's roll real quick.
01:05:24.40 --> 01:05:27.92 He even threw that out there. Like it was just going to be a quick roll quick. Yeah, just a quick roll.
01:05:28.16 --> 01:05:31.12 So I'm thinking, I'm thinking too much through. I'm literally I'm thinking too much through
01:05:31.12 --> 01:05:35.52 if you're meant to like to go over, maybe try some of the stuff we were just drilling a little bit.
01:05:37.28 --> 01:05:43.20 No, he comes full on. I mean, and it was the disguised full on. So he didn't, you know, get
01:05:43.20 --> 01:05:50.48 up. But he just went very sternly and, and passed my guard really quick. And then, and actually,
01:05:51.84 --> 01:05:56.16 you know, you and I were, had discussed this mountain escape that I had done to the other
01:05:56.16 --> 01:05:59.12 day. And I was actually like, I don't know, care if he mounts right now. I've got this new escape.
01:05:59.12 --> 01:06:06.24 And I'll just use that. And he aggressively mounted and he aggressively went for this move that we call
01:06:06.24 --> 01:06:13.44 the snow angel, which is when you get the person's arms up like a snow angel, like up above their head
01:06:13.44 --> 01:06:17.36 from the mountain. And it's just horrible. And they're in there. Yeah.
01:06:17.36 --> 01:06:21.60 Yeah. We're above. You have no leverage. You can't move. And so not only give me a snow
01:06:21.60 --> 01:06:29.44 inch, you've got me in double snow. So both my arms are stuck up there. Now, what was bad about this
01:06:29.44 --> 01:06:33.28 was there was a moment. Okay. And this was this is the rule that I learned because after we broke
01:06:33.28 --> 01:06:40.48 it down. So Dean kept me there for, you know, probably seven minutes in double snow angel,
01:06:40.48 --> 01:06:44.56 which is just a nightmare. Because he's not just holding me there. He's like saying things.
01:06:44.56 --> 01:06:49.76 And you know, he's antagonizing me. And I'm sitting there just wanting to kill him. And
01:06:49.76 --> 01:06:54.80 I forget he, I actually forget how it ended. I don't remember if he went for an arm lock and he
01:06:54.80 --> 01:06:59.52 got it or if he went, I got out. I forget how it ended because it's kind of a big blur, which most of
01:06:59.52 --> 01:07:04.40 my rules are. But anyways, the rule is, and I don't want to go into too much detail,
01:07:04.40 --> 01:07:07.92 be just because it's a little too technical and too hard to, you know, do through the audio
01:07:07.92 --> 01:07:15.52 podcast. But, you know, basically, I don't let my elbow cross the other person's sternum. I don't
01:07:15.52 --> 01:07:19.52 let it go across their sternum because if it does, you can get pin there. You can stuck there.
01:07:19.52 --> 01:07:24.32 So there was a moment where, when Dean was trying to move me into snow angel, where I should have
01:07:24.32 --> 01:07:29.60 sacrificed and done like a drastic movement that's a major breaking of that rule and turned to
01:07:29.60 --> 01:07:34.80 my side really hard and put my elbow across his sternum and it would have gotten me out.
01:07:35.84 --> 01:07:40.64 And as we, as we looked at it, you know, because once I was out, then we went over for a few minutes,
01:07:40.64 --> 01:07:46.000 just to just try and analyze what happened. And I realized that, you know, that I had to
01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:51.84 held onto this rule of mind even though part of me was like, you know, what, should I try it?
01:07:51.84 --> 01:07:56.08 And I didn't, I didn't try it. And so then I got a worse position, worse position, worse position.
01:07:56.08 --> 01:08:01.20 So the lesson learned is that sometimes you got to break your rules. Now, the thing is,
01:08:02.32 --> 01:08:09.36 it's not just you, Jitsu, right? It's not just you, Jitsu. It's about business. It's about life.
01:08:09.36 --> 01:08:15.76 It's about relationships. It's about not getting stuck in a rut. And it's about
01:08:15.76 --> 01:08:21.28 being able, because it's another thing is I, I was in my own head. I didn't detach from the
01:08:21.28 --> 01:08:26.16 situation. I didn't look at it from another position and say, okay, you know, this is getting worse
01:08:26.16 --> 01:08:34.56 right now. I just was stuck there mentally. So you got to think, you got to think about your rules
01:08:34.56 --> 01:08:41.04 objectively. And I didn't do that. And it's a rule that has, has saved me many times. But this time,
01:08:41.04 --> 01:08:50.64 it, it costs me nearly, nearly. So don't let your rules rule you. You got to keep ruling your rules.
01:08:50.64 --> 01:08:56.96 Don't let your rules rule you. Yeah, you, um, another way to kind of look at that is a, like, a
01:08:56.96 --> 01:09:03.04 black and white mind, you know, you don't, like, don't stick. Your mind is more or less black and
01:09:03.04 --> 01:09:09.04 white for sure. Well, as far as I think generally speaking, but don't neglect the gray.
01:09:09.04 --> 01:09:12.64 Yeah, just so much gray in there. And of course, you know, if you have rules and their solid rules,
01:09:12.64 --> 01:09:17.04 man, yeah, stick to those rules. But like I said, don't neglect the gray. You know, how you say,
01:09:17.04 --> 01:09:22.16 you got to break rule everyone, so I don't be just, hey, rules are meant to be broken. Let's just break
01:09:22.16 --> 01:09:27.36 it. Not don't do that. People use that as a, uh, some people use that as a, uh, excuse to do whatever
01:09:27.36 --> 01:09:30.80 they want. Right. Yeah, exactly. And they're wrong to, they lack the discipline.
01:09:30.80 --> 01:09:40.88 I'll, next question. Let's do it. I'm glad you use that. Mom, skip by the way. Check.
01:09:44.08 --> 01:09:50.80 Do you have any advice on consoling a member of your team that you're leading who knows
01:09:50.80 --> 01:09:57.60 there to blame for the project failing or, um, falling through? The person question is a great worker,
01:09:57.60 --> 01:10:03.84 but just made an honest mistake that cost that caused the failure of the project. If you
01:10:03.84 --> 01:10:08.88 extremely guilty for putting my job at risk and I can't convey to them enough that I understand
01:10:08.88 --> 01:10:14.96 it was an honest mistake. And then I personally failed to communicate enough with them. I think it's a
01:10:14.96 --> 01:10:22.24 great thing this person is so passionate at their job. But is there any way I can get them to distance
01:10:22.24 --> 01:10:35.20 themselves and show them that this one failure is not that big of a deal? So, um, yeah, like, like,
01:10:35.20 --> 01:10:39.60 the question says it's cool that you got somebody that's passionate, right? That's great.
01:10:39.60 --> 01:10:43.76 And it sounds like they want to take ownership and that's great too. It sounds like they are
01:10:43.76 --> 01:10:50.88 having trouble moving on. So, in this case, no, no major complication. This is not that big of a deal.
01:10:50.88 --> 01:10:56.56 You just got to talk them through it. And for me, I would use probably some kind of, you know,
01:10:56.56 --> 01:11:00.72 some stories, a real simple one is like about parachuting. And if you're parachuting,
01:11:00.72 --> 01:11:05.20 one of the main training points when you're parachuting and something goes wrong,
01:11:05.60 --> 01:11:11.76 yes, you don't get focused on just trying to fix the bad shoot. Because that's what gets people
01:11:11.76 --> 01:11:15.76 killed. They're looking up. They think maybe they can save the shoot. They think they can make it open
01:11:15.76 --> 01:11:21.84 somehow. And the next thing you know, they hit the ground, right? And they die. So, what they do is they
01:11:21.84 --> 01:11:26.64 they teach you that, hey, you got to bat you, you know, you pull your main parachute and it doesn't
01:11:26.64 --> 01:11:30.56 open correctly. You take a look at it, you go, okay, is this thing going to open or not? You make a
01:11:30.56 --> 01:11:36.000 decision and then you cut it away. And it's gone. And you focus on the next thing, which is getting
01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:40.48 your reserve parachute to come out to save your life. The one that didn't open doesn't matter
01:11:40.48 --> 01:11:45.76 anymore. So move on. You can think about it like a like a shooting competition, too, because it's the
01:11:45.76 --> 01:11:52.56 same thing. When you're shooting, you don't want to shoot. You don't want to think about the last shot
01:11:52.56 --> 01:11:57.12 that you just missed. And you don't want to think about the next shot. That's a hard shot or a
01:11:57.12 --> 01:12:00.88 far shot or you don't want to think about those other shots. You want to think about the shot
01:12:00.88 --> 01:12:06.16 that you're taking. That's the one that you want to think about. And if you're getting caught in the past,
01:12:06.16 --> 01:12:12.32 it's going to ruin what you're trying to do in the present. So you, you know, you have to move on.
01:12:12.32 --> 01:12:16.72 This is something you've got to explain to your employee that's getting your look, listen,
01:12:16.72 --> 01:12:20.72 I understand that you had a rough time. If you can't let that go, it's going to screw up the project
01:12:20.72 --> 01:12:24.48 or working on now. So let's let that go. Let's move on. So that's what I'd say. I'm saying,
01:12:24.48 --> 01:12:30.64 listen, look, buddy. I know this one went bad. I get it. You feel bad. Appreciate it. It's over.
01:12:30.64 --> 01:12:36.56 It's in the past. Let's take the lessons learned and we got to move on. It's not. Do I want
01:12:36.56 --> 01:12:42.40 yesterday? If we do well on yesterday, it takes our focus off of today and tomorrow, which are the
01:12:42.40 --> 01:12:47.04 things we can actually control. We can actually control what we're doing today. We can actually control
01:12:47.04 --> 01:12:51.44 what we're going to do tomorrow. We don't have any control over what happened yesterday. That's gone.
01:12:51.44 --> 01:12:59.60 So what I need you to do is focus on this mission now and making sure we execute it 100%.
01:12:59.60 --> 01:13:09.04 That sense of or that access to control over a situation that's so critical to know when you're
01:13:09.04 --> 01:13:14.08 in that position. Because to know what to know that you control it. Yeah, to have it on the front.
01:13:14.08 --> 01:13:19.44 What you can't in control. Yeah, to like I said, have access to that because it feels as
01:13:19.44 --> 01:13:26.40 farce feeling so. It feels like you use the parachute analogy. It feels like, there's the problem.
01:13:26.40 --> 01:13:30.64 The parachute, that's the problem. So all my attention and all my emotional
01:13:30.64 --> 01:13:36.40 energy is on that. That's the problem. But like I said, if you just
01:13:36.40 --> 01:13:41.04 under just focus on the fact that I can't control that bad shoot that bad shoot is gone.
01:13:41.04 --> 01:13:46.64 That's, you know, and cut it away. And yeah, focus on the thing. But like I said, man, that's
01:13:46.64 --> 01:13:51.52 the key right there to understand that man, you don't have control over that anymore. We're done
01:13:51.52 --> 01:13:55.20 with that. We're not doing that anymore. Yeah. We're doing this new stuff. You know, I should have said that
01:13:55.20 --> 01:13:59.60 on the last one about talking about breaking rules. I said business. I said, life, I forgot to say combat.
01:13:59.60 --> 01:14:03.52 But combat's the same way. If you get stuck in a standard operating procedure and you won't see
01:14:03.52 --> 01:14:09.12 your way out of it, you're going to pay and it's the same thing in combat. If you make one bad
01:14:09.12 --> 01:14:14.000 decision on the battlefield and now you start dwelling on that bad decision, you kind of forget about
01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:18.64 that. You got to move on. You got to move forward. So, you know, the only reason you look back,
01:14:18.64 --> 01:14:22.48 it's just assess the lessons learned. You're going to take away from it and then turn back around
01:14:22.48 --> 01:14:26.80 it. Look forward. Don't get sucked into the past and get drowned and pulled back there because
01:14:26.80 --> 01:14:31.84 you can't control it. You can't change what happened. Yeah. Move on, buddy. That other question,
01:14:31.84 --> 01:14:37.60 the black and white mind one, or you breaking your own rules. You're one rule. Kind of like,
01:14:37.60 --> 01:14:42.56 um, on Ghostbusters, one, don't cross the streams. You're watching Ghostbusters. Yeah.
01:14:43.68 --> 01:14:48.08 Same thing that. But then they had to eventually. Right. They had to cross the streams. The
01:14:48.08 --> 01:14:53.84 streams to kill that. The demon. Yeah. The urination man. I think you actually intentionally try to
01:14:53.84 --> 01:14:59.36 do this. That was a little reach. That was a little reach. Those are understandable terms.
01:15:00.40 --> 01:15:00.80 Okay.
01:15:05.20 --> 01:15:05.76 Jockel.
01:15:09.84 --> 01:15:12.96 What's the best advice heading into the military straight from high school?
01:15:12.96 --> 01:15:19.76 Well, and this this question is actually from my brothers from Downhunter,
01:15:19.76 --> 01:15:25.36 Cain, Dover, and Nicholas Bennett. And they've been, uh, they've been down there in Australia
01:15:25.36 --> 01:15:30.48 getting there getting there for a and wake up challenge on for about, I don't know, 35 or 40 days
01:15:30.48 --> 01:15:35.12 there at this point. And what's cool. What's been cool is hearing their feedback as they've kind of
01:15:35.12 --> 01:15:38.88 turned their lives around and they're getting all the stuff done. And actually, you know, it was
01:15:38.88 --> 01:15:44.08 hilarious. He sent a one of them said a tweet with a picture of a text conversation with some
01:15:44.08 --> 01:15:49.60 company that they were trying to work with. And it said something like the time on the tweet was,
01:15:50.24 --> 01:15:55.04 you know, 501 in the morning or something like that. And you know, he said, hey, you're still offering
01:15:55.04 --> 01:16:00.80 blank or some program or whatever. And then the response was, yes, we are still offering that. And then
01:16:00.80 --> 01:16:06.24 then the, you know, the reply was, okay, I'm really interested in accessing that program or whatever.
01:16:06.24 --> 01:16:13.84 And the response was, okay, but don't text people at 5 a.m. And then the response to that was, okay,
01:16:14.56 --> 01:16:19.68 wake up earlier, which I thought was classic. So those guys are rocking. It's very cool to see.
01:16:21.28 --> 01:16:25.52 So, and what it's actually one of the, and I figured, which one of them, one of their brothers is going
01:16:25.52 --> 01:16:30.16 in the military, which is awesome. Very cool to see Australian military work with them a little bit.
01:16:30.96 --> 01:16:35.04 Actually work with them on a small level a lot, meaning that I work with a couple of their soldiers a
01:16:35.04 --> 01:16:38.56 lot over the years, but I never worked with them in a big unit, but they were great guys.
01:16:39.44 --> 01:16:43.84 Here's a couple real simple things. And I'm assuming that he's going to some kind of army or
01:16:43.84 --> 01:16:49.52 some kind of ground for us. He's going to be a trooper on the ground. Obviously, being shape,
01:16:49.52 --> 01:16:56.000 do runs, do pushups, do situps, do pullups. I would say be ready to march in boots. That's one of the
01:16:56.000 --> 01:17:03.36 things that you do in any infantry unit that is shocking to civilians is putting on boots and
01:17:03.36 --> 01:17:08.32 putting on rucksacks and walking on distances. Well, do your feet get like your feet
01:17:08.32 --> 01:17:13.84 rushed? It's just a different kind of exercise. And we talked about before at Humberock, man.
01:17:13.84 --> 01:17:17.84 You got to just put on a rock and humberock and you got to wear whatever footwear they're going to
01:17:17.84 --> 01:17:23.68 supply you, trying to get the closest thing to that and get your feet ready for it so that you
01:17:23.68 --> 01:17:29.84 so that you don't get your feet destroyed, become football in the water. So most military has some
01:17:29.84 --> 01:17:35.04 kind of water testing. You know, we're going to throw you into pool, whatever. You know, going with
01:17:35.04 --> 01:17:38.80 a normal haircut, that's not going to make that big of a deal because, you know, they're going to
01:17:38.80 --> 01:17:42.08 shave your head within moments of showing up. So that's not the apricot of a deal. But, uh,
01:17:43.52 --> 01:17:46.32 detach. Okay. You're going to get these crappy situations where people in New
01:17:46.32 --> 01:17:51.76 Yellinachy were making you much stuff. Just detach, just detach and watch it because the drill
01:17:51.76 --> 01:17:56.24 instructors are hilarious. And if you're, if you're getting it, if they're in your face,
01:17:56.24 --> 01:18:01.52 you can be like, damn, this is harsh. But if they're in your face, but you're watching it from
01:18:02.32 --> 01:18:06.80 a free place of mind, it's so awesome to watch and it's so fun. And so easy to understand what they're
01:18:06.80 --> 01:18:11.84 doing. You know, you got to remember they're not going to kill you in training. And, and
01:18:13.20 --> 01:18:19.20 enjoy it. I had fun. I had fun in all my indoctrination courses, which is, you know, you're all
01:18:19.20 --> 01:18:23.92 your courses where you're getting treated like a recruit. So for me, it was boot camp. It was Buds.
01:18:23.92 --> 01:18:29.12 It was Airborne School and, and really an OCS too, Officer Cannon at school. All those things.
01:18:29.12 --> 01:18:35.36 I had a great time. I had a blast at those schools. I had fun getting indoctrinated. I embraced
01:18:36.16 --> 01:18:40.16 the little rules that they throw outside the barista and I take them to the extreme. And I had
01:18:40.16 --> 01:18:46.88 that's how I ended up having fun fun with it. And then the last thing I would say, and I actually,
01:18:46.88 --> 01:18:55.44 I almost missed this. But this is, this might be the most important thing. Okay. So you're 18 years old.
01:18:55.44 --> 01:19:01.36 You just got done with high school. You show up in the military and guess what? You start getting a paycheck.
01:19:02.24 --> 01:19:06.96 All of a sudden you're the richest guy in the world. Because at Mickey D's, you were making
01:19:06.96 --> 01:19:13.52 750 an hour. And all of a sudden now you're getting a fat paycheck of, you know, $2200 a month.
01:19:13.52 --> 01:19:17.44 But you don't have any expenses. Because you're in the barracks or whatever. You've got all your food
01:19:17.44 --> 01:19:22.80 coming to you. So what are you going to do with that money? Well, a lot of guys in the military.
01:19:23.36 --> 01:19:30.32 What they do with that money is they blow it. They blow it on women and whiskey and they get the
01:19:30.32 --> 01:19:37.12 big toys. They get the massive toys. They get the massive trucks and motorcycles and hardlies and
01:19:37.12 --> 01:19:42.88 and everything. I got nothing against those things. But what you need to do is save your money.
01:19:42.88 --> 01:19:49.36 And, you know, they throw figures around 15% of your paycheck, 20% of your paycheck, 10% of your
01:19:49.36 --> 01:19:56.32 paycheck. But put that money somewhere long term where you're going to grow it. And then I would tell
01:19:56.32 --> 01:20:02.80 you, you know, on just by house, by house and then rent out the rooms to three guys and you sleep on the
01:20:02.80 --> 01:20:08.80 couch and have them be paying your mortgage. And when you get them all stabilized and that mortgage
01:20:08.80 --> 01:20:15.20 is kind of covered, it go by another house and do that every few years. And there's no reason
01:20:16.72 --> 01:20:22.24 to retire from the military and not be completely set where you never have to work again. If you just
01:20:22.24 --> 01:20:29.68 don't blow all your money on stuff that you don't need. And I'm not saying you got to live like a
01:20:29.68 --> 01:20:37.68 monk. But just don't blow all of it. Blow some of it. Don't blow all of it. And that's that's
01:20:37.68 --> 01:20:44.40 real important to all the folks doing the military or new to the military. You can make that happen.
01:20:46.16 --> 01:20:49.52 Financial discipline equals financial freedom. There you go.
01:20:49.52 --> 01:20:59.28 Good. Next question. I'm a firefighter slash paramedic. Historically, my profession has always
01:20:59.28 --> 01:21:05.36 been composed of alpha men. And all you had to worry about was teaching the skill and not the
01:21:05.36 --> 01:21:10.48 aggressive side of a person that is key within this job. We now face a new generation where they're
01:21:10.48 --> 01:21:15.92 hiring soft, they're hiring softer men. Quite a quote, softer men. Do the upper management and
01:21:15.92 --> 01:21:22.88 human resources criteria. So when you get these guys, the drive that is needed to do the job is not there.
01:21:24.08 --> 01:21:30.72 I truly believe that our profession is a calling that goes for all public servants in the
01:21:30.72 --> 01:21:35.92 material like. So my question to you is, how do you still aggression or passion? How do you
01:21:35.92 --> 01:21:42.48 instill it? How do you turn a soft man into an alpha male? Skill can be taught. But aggression and
01:21:42.48 --> 01:21:47.44 passion is where I come up short and tend to get frustrated because some people don't love this job the
01:21:47.44 --> 01:21:54.56 way I do. So soft men will potentially be put in a position where they may have to pull me out of fire
01:21:54.56 --> 01:22:00.16 or even save someone's life and aggression will be key. Call me crazy. But I'd rather have the
01:22:00.16 --> 01:22:06.48 alpha male that gets after it on a daily basis to pull me out. Yeah, no doubt about that. You want to
01:22:06.48 --> 01:22:10.000 have the guys that's going to be aggressive and make things happen at the moment of truth. So how do
01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:14.72 you do that? How do you still that? Well, number one hard training. You know, you've got to set up
01:22:14.72 --> 01:22:20.72 training for your people that is tough, that challenges them and at first they'll be some
01:22:20.72 --> 01:22:26.88 you know complaining about it and whatever else. But eventually people start to embrace that hard training
01:22:26.88 --> 01:22:33.44 that starts to make them feel proud. And that's what you want them to do. You want to push them
01:22:33.44 --> 01:22:43.28 mentally and physically and you want to have them understand a very important premise because
01:22:43.28 --> 01:22:50.000 if you take the fact that these guys are let's call them softer, well that means they want to have
01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:56.24 like you know they want to be safe. Right? Well, you need to teach these guys that the best way to
01:22:56.24 --> 01:23:04.32 mitigate risk is to be aggressive. Right? If you want to mitigate risk, the best way to mitigate
01:23:04.32 --> 01:23:10.64 risk is to be aggressive. So example, if you think a fight's going to happen, what's the best way to
01:23:10.64 --> 01:23:15.84 you know control that situation? It's to be aggressive to aggressively attack the enemy. If you're
01:23:15.84 --> 01:23:19.52 in a gun fighting situation and someone's attacking you, what's the best thing to do? It's
01:23:19.52 --> 01:23:26.000 flank them and attack them. You want to be aggressive in a firefight. If you're fighting a fire,
01:23:26.88 --> 01:23:30.88 you want to fight the fire. You don't want to let the fire burn and get out of control. You want
01:23:30.88 --> 01:23:36.32 to aggressively get the fire under control. So aggression is the best way to mitigate risk. So
01:23:36.32 --> 01:23:43.60 get these guys in that mentality of where they recognize that the aggression is an important
01:23:43.60 --> 01:23:46.56 facet of what they're doing and you want to put them in training scenarios where the aggression
01:23:46.56 --> 01:23:51.20 wins and Pacificity loses. You want to put them in situation where, oh, guess what? You sat back and
01:23:51.20 --> 01:23:56.08 waited and now we got the whole building on fire or you sat back and waited and now the people that we
01:23:56.08 --> 01:24:01.60 could rescue three minutes ago are going to die because you hesitated at the moment of truth.
01:24:01.60 --> 01:24:08.08 So you got to teach them that aggressiveness over and over and over again. And I think that's
01:24:08.08 --> 01:24:20.32 that's what you got to do. I know that I want to once you'll officer that I was working with,
01:24:20.96 --> 01:24:25.20 we were going through land warfare training and land warfare training is you got
01:24:26.24 --> 01:24:32.32 machine guns firing, you got rockets going off, you got smoke grenades, it's man. And if you're going
01:24:32.32 --> 01:24:38.24 to, you have to grab control of the situation. So you're doing it what we call immediate action
01:24:38.24 --> 01:24:44.16 drills and everyone's shooting live fire and maneuvering and you've got to grab control of the
01:24:44.16 --> 01:24:52.08 situation and you've got to make things happen aggressively through force of will. And so this
01:24:52.08 --> 01:24:55.44 once you'll officer, you're going to have to all this great guy, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he
01:24:55.44 --> 01:25:01.12 was not making it happen. He wasn't being aggressive enough. And I said to him, I said, hey man,
01:25:01.12 --> 01:25:05.20 you got to be more aggressive, you got to get, you got to get fired up with your guys.
01:25:06.32 --> 01:25:09.52 And he said, he literally said to me, I remember like it was yesterday, he goes,
01:25:09.52 --> 01:25:21.20 I don't know if I can get any more fired up. And I said, okay, hang with me. And just just follow
01:25:21.20 --> 01:25:28.32 me. And I took command of his squad of eight guys. And I said, just follow me. So we went,
01:25:28.32 --> 01:25:33.60 we got in a contact drill and the shooting started and boom, I showed him what aggressive look like.
01:25:33.60 --> 01:25:39.68 Hey, you two set up on this corner right there. You get up there, start laying down fire,
01:25:39.68 --> 01:25:44.96 you over here, start getting ahead count as you yelling, placing guys, making it happen through
01:25:44.96 --> 01:25:50.72 force of will. It's being aggressive. And it was that was all took.
01:25:50.72 --> 01:25:56.96 Like he just didn't understand the difference. He didn't understand what aggression looked like
01:25:56.96 --> 01:26:02.48 and he didn't understand how it impacted the situation. When you're not being aggressive out on
01:26:02.48 --> 01:26:08.40 the battlefield, you have no control. Things will just, things will just happen and you will have no
01:26:08.40 --> 01:26:15.20 control of them. So, and guess what? It's the same thing in life. If you're not aggressively
01:26:15.20 --> 01:26:24.000 pursuing your goals. Again, that doesn't mean you're aggressively confronting people at every turn.
01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:29.92 No, it means you're aggressively pursuing your goals. Yeah. Through any means necessary.
01:26:29.92 --> 01:26:34.96 Again, people get confused and think that I'm in someone's face. Hey, we're doing this my way.
01:26:34.96 --> 01:26:39.76 No, no, no, you're aggressively pursuing your goals. You're not aggressively pursuing people.
01:26:39.76 --> 01:26:43.76 You're not aggressively pursuing personalities. You're not aggressively confronting people.
01:26:43.76 --> 01:26:47.92 You're confronting the challenge. Not the people. Do you have to confront people? Sometimes,
01:26:47.92 --> 01:26:53.20 yes, of course you do. Which you're aggressively confronting and attacking the challenge.
01:26:53.20 --> 01:27:00.32 The mission. Not the people. But anyways, this guy didn't quite understand. So I had to show him.
01:27:00.32 --> 01:27:05.28 I had to let him see what that looked like. What it looked like to say, you know, hey, take it
01:27:05.28 --> 01:27:10.64 out right here. Grab a guy and say, stop a corner right here. Start moving guys and have them see that.
01:27:10.64 --> 01:27:16.48 And guess what? Then you get the other people in the squad start seeing it and they start
01:27:16.48 --> 01:27:24.48 acting aggressively to make things happen. And that's when you do it. That's what you do.
01:27:24.48 --> 01:27:32.72 And obviously what that means is you as a leader, you have to lead. You have to show these guys the
01:27:32.72 --> 01:27:40.56 way how important aggression is and how to do it. Yeah. And kind of in life, I think you can
01:27:40.56 --> 01:27:46.48 because again, it's one of those things that sounds pretty simple. It's either be aggressive or you're
01:27:46.48 --> 01:27:51.12 not being aggressive kind of thing, but it's so hard because like for example, if you're in life,
01:27:52.32 --> 01:27:55.84 a lot of people they sit back and wait for things to kind of happen like, oh, I'm waiting.
01:27:55.84 --> 01:27:59.52 You know, you hear people say it and it just hasn't happened for me yet and I'm waiting for my big
01:27:59.52 --> 01:28:04.48 brain kind of thing. No wrong attitude. Yeah, exactly. But when you're in that situation,
01:28:04.48 --> 01:28:10.24 it kind of seems like that's how the world works. So it doesn't, and a lot of it, you know,
01:28:10.24 --> 01:28:18.32 it's maybe how people are raised. I don't know where if you don't know what that is that if you don't
01:28:18.32 --> 01:28:23.76 have access to that feeling of being an aggressive person, it's hard to get there. Until like
01:28:23.76 --> 01:28:27.84 how you say it's someone shows you like in the exact situation that you're in and in your
01:28:27.84 --> 01:28:33.20 cases that one specific of training situation, you show them how. So it probably clicked right away,
01:28:33.20 --> 01:28:38.72 but in life, there's all these situations. So just to be an aggressive person might be kind of
01:28:38.72 --> 01:28:43.68 hard for someone to access unless they have like a mentor or someone who demonstrated it.
01:28:43.68 --> 01:28:47.60 It definitely is. It definitely is hard in life. It's hard to show people all the different
01:28:47.60 --> 01:28:52.72 situations. And because then you are also kind of up with people that are overly aggressive, right?
01:28:52.72 --> 01:28:55.92 Or aggressive on the wrong way. The aggressive in the wrong direction. You know, I said this
01:28:55.92 --> 01:29:00.000 something that some of the other day, they were talking about being that they're talking about like,
01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:05.28 I'm super passionate about this. And I said, don't aim your passion at the people because people
01:29:05.28 --> 01:29:11.52 find that offensive. You got to aim your passion at the mission and let. I mean, there'll be
01:29:11.52 --> 01:29:17.12 some collateral encouragement when people see someone that's fired up. When people see someone that's
01:29:17.12 --> 01:29:23.04 passionate, it makes people excited about the mission as well. But if I hit you with my passion,
01:29:23.04 --> 01:29:28.88 if I aim my passion at you, all of a sudden you're intimidated by it, you're turned off by it,
01:29:28.88 --> 01:29:33.68 you're defamed defensive by it. So that's what you have to be careful. If you want to aim your
01:29:33.68 --> 01:29:40.40 passion, aim your aggression at the mission, not at the people. What you want to do with people,
01:29:40.40 --> 01:29:45.20 you want to influence them. You want to steer them. You want to pull them along. You want to make
01:29:45.20 --> 01:29:50.72 them give them the idea. So they think that they're moving in that direction on their own. You
01:29:50.72 --> 01:29:54.16 actually want them to be. Never mind. Think you want them to move in that direction on their own.
01:29:54.96 --> 01:29:58.72 That's leadership. And so that's what you got to do with this aggressive thing. It's definitely a
01:29:58.72 --> 01:30:04.64 really good question. I would also say, what, what music are they listening to? What, what,
01:30:04.64 --> 01:30:09.44 what TV shows are they watching? What movies are they watching? Are they watching? You have to see
01:30:09.44 --> 01:30:15.84 you straight up. Are they watching people fight? Are you doing any training? Are you hitting
01:30:15.84 --> 01:30:22.80 bags? Are you throwing some mojtai kicks? Are you grappling? You know, do those things raise
01:30:22.80 --> 01:30:28.96 aggression levels? Are they working out hard? You know, they're like no kidding. Squatting heavy
01:30:28.96 --> 01:30:37.68 weights increases your testosterone period. It really does. So get on the squat rack and start
01:30:37.68 --> 01:30:46.88 getting that testosterone flow through your system. Yeah. Let's go to the next question.
01:30:47.60 --> 01:30:51.68 Be aggressive on that one. Just be aggressive and lead aggressively.
01:30:51.68 --> 01:30:58.16 Yeah, funny how you mentioned UFC because you can kind of in that regard, you can learn a little bit
01:30:58.16 --> 01:31:03.76 because you can hear like you always hear the coach or whatever yelling saying be first. Be first.
01:31:03.76 --> 01:31:08.24 Be first. Be first. Don't do stuff like that. Yeah. You definitely don't hear him say, hey,
01:31:08.24 --> 01:31:13.68 sit back and wait to get attacked. Yeah, exactly. You don't hear him say, okay, be defensive. Yeah,
01:31:13.68 --> 01:31:19.28 or be past. Yeah, exactly. Does it happen? Next question. Some jiu jitsu talk.
01:31:19.28 --> 01:31:27.84 What type of style do you play? Aggressive, passive, reactive, or smash and pass?
01:31:29.04 --> 01:31:36.16 etc. Well, I mean, I've trained with you. You probably, you know, have an assessment,
01:31:36.16 --> 01:31:41.36 your assessment of my game, which will be a limited assessment, by the way, because the game that I
01:31:41.36 --> 01:31:48.56 show you is the is the is built to contend with what you bring to the table. Yeah. If you
01:31:48.56 --> 01:31:53.76 brought it something else, you'd see something else. Yeah, and I have a little bit beyond that,
01:31:53.76 --> 01:32:01.92 because I witnessed you in the all the time, more so before the notice, but yeah, I would say my assessment.
01:32:01.92 --> 01:32:06.56 Yeah, okay, yeah, so you watch me with other people, and you can see. So you do see that I trained
01:32:06.56 --> 01:32:10.72 different ways with other people. Yeah, and really that's really the core of the evaluation,
01:32:10.72 --> 01:32:17.84 is that when you roll with people, it's like you're real, um, it's like variable style,
01:32:17.84 --> 01:32:24.24 you know, it changes. So, and it depends your mood to, like if you're just messing around with
01:32:24.24 --> 01:32:29.20 me or whatever, you're like, you know, this is kind of weird, but you do this thing that no one
01:32:29.20 --> 01:32:34.56 really does, and you look like you look me in the eye, like while you're rolling, it's weird,
01:32:34.56 --> 01:32:38.08 because I know you're just messing with me, like, like, everything I do, you're like, oh,
01:32:38.08 --> 01:32:43.76 who knows cute kind of kind of an attitude, and then, you know, if I talk too much, you know,
01:32:43.76 --> 01:32:49.68 whatever, then you'll, yeah, it's smashing past. So in regards to these these choices,
01:32:50.64 --> 01:32:58.96 all, all of the above, right? So, so passive when you're kind of taunting and maybe even learning,
01:32:58.96 --> 01:33:03.12 or not, you're taunting a style of jujitsu. Yes, it is, it's your style.
01:33:05.20 --> 01:33:09.44 And so you'll be passive kind of waiting for me to do something, and then if it doesn't work,
01:33:09.44 --> 01:33:13.68 then you taunt some more, and then, so that's passive, and then reactive is obviously, you know,
01:33:13.68 --> 01:33:20.48 and reacting to anything that I try to do. Aggressive is when either time runs, is running short,
01:33:20.48 --> 01:33:27.28 or I talk too much, and smashing past is the result of that aggressive stuff.
01:33:27.28 --> 01:33:31.92 In really, in replace of smashing past, oh, I mean, I think the alternate for me is,
01:33:31.92 --> 01:33:35.92 is a little something that we like to call the disrespect, right? The disrespect?
01:33:35.92 --> 01:33:40.40 Yeah, which is when you just completely disrespect the person's guard and just pass and smash them.
01:33:40.40 --> 01:33:42.80 Yeah, yeah, the disrespect for us.
01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:52.000 Yeah, and I think the key point for this for me is that, I agree with you. Like I have a decent guard.
01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:56.88 I have a good top position, pretty good at card passing, or whatever. I'm not, I'm not
01:33:56.88 --> 01:34:02.96 graded jujitsu, but I'm decent at some areas, and I'm pretty, one thing I am is I'm pretty comfortable.
01:34:02.96 --> 01:34:09.28 Like in just about any situation, there's no situation where I'm, there's no situation where I'm freaked out.
01:34:09.28 --> 01:34:12.56 Like I don't mind being in half-garden online, being on half-garden top bottom,
01:34:12.56 --> 01:34:17.28 I don't mind being guard closed open, whatever, I don't mind being mounted. I can pretty much handle
01:34:17.28 --> 01:34:23.36 any situation. You know, and again, when you're training with Dean, you get, you get very comfortable
01:34:23.36 --> 01:34:31.28 with people because you have a guy that's just a savage, and, but what's interesting about this
01:34:31.28 --> 01:34:36.48 is for me, and I talked about this, I mean, I talked about this, there's a dichotomy here, right?
01:34:36.48 --> 01:34:42.80 Like if being aggressive is not working, then you have to try that other game. You know,
01:34:42.80 --> 01:34:47.76 I always say if you're, if you're trying to pass someone's guard really close and you can't do it
01:34:47.76 --> 01:34:53.44 back away because there's an opening there, and it's the same again, it's the same thing with
01:34:53.44 --> 01:34:58.32 wife, right? If you're beating your head against a wall, try a different route. When there's one
01:34:58.32 --> 01:35:04.48 door that's closed or heavily defended, in combat, go find another door, go breach a window,
01:35:04.48 --> 01:35:12.08 go find another way, there's an opening somewhere else. And I think that's what my game is.
01:35:13.60 --> 01:35:21.76 I think that's what my game is. It's like you said variable, based on a variety of
01:35:21.76 --> 01:35:32.48 influences both in my world and in my opponents world. Yeah, and surprisingly, and I think that
01:35:32.48 --> 01:35:38.32 people, a lot of people, wouldn't really assume this right away, is that you're, um, yeah, sure,
01:35:38.32 --> 01:35:43.36 you're gonna smash and you're aggressive and kind of rough a lot of times, but you're like, um,
01:35:44.16 --> 01:35:49.92 like a playful, you get to guy. Oh, I was gonna say this, and this is, I think this is important. I had a guy
01:35:49.92 --> 01:35:58.96 ask me, how hard do you go? And the answer is very easy. I go just hard enough that I'm staying
01:35:58.96 --> 01:36:04.48 ahead of the other person. Now with you, if those of you that are listening on audio,
01:36:04.48 --> 01:36:09.28 that was making a face because there are times when I have to step up my game a little bit and
01:36:09.28 --> 01:36:16.96 put the wood. Sometimes we're straight up, that's not true. Yeah, okay. Okay, yeah, but there might be some,
01:36:16.96 --> 01:36:24.64 oh, you know why? That's because you come in with, sometimes you come in with a, you know,
01:36:24.64 --> 01:36:28.48 with an attitude of, yeah, I can see it in your eyes. You're like, today's the day. Mm-hmm.
01:36:28.48 --> 01:36:32.80 And you come in there and you got the this series look on your face now. Okay, cool. It's going to be
01:36:32.80 --> 01:36:36.24 like that right on. Mm-hmm. And so you know, yeah, I have to bring the needle a little bit.
01:36:37.20 --> 01:36:44.000 Yeah, yeah, yeah, full. Yeah. But that same, and this is the part where I think it's kind of
01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:50.24 kind of interesting is that you do, it doesn't seem like a war. Like it seems like a war, but all
01:36:50.24 --> 01:36:57.68 within the confines of some silly, getting that silly, but some game. Yeah. But, but it's obvious though.
01:36:58.64 --> 01:37:03.04 You know, like, I think that someone who may be never seen your role or never had that experience
01:37:03.04 --> 01:37:08.80 with you specifically, they would assume that you're this like, heavy, mindy, that's going to show.
01:37:08.80 --> 01:37:12.80 I'm going to smash in that, and that I'm taking this really serious. Yeah. No, I know.
01:37:12.80 --> 01:37:16.88 Because some guys are like that. Yeah, that's true. It's not that I don't take Jiu-Jitsu seriously,
01:37:16.88 --> 01:37:22.000 but Jiu-Jitsu is a fun to me. Right. It's so fun to me. Yeah. And I think that the better you get
01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:27.44 the more fun it gets and unless you have to be like that, you know. And I don't mind when people
01:37:27.44 --> 01:37:31.44 come at me like that, because I still get to do the same thing. You know, I still get to have fun.
01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:37.28 Yeah. And yeah, no, Jiu-Jitsu should be fun. Yeah. Really should be fun. The funner is for you,
01:37:37.28 --> 01:37:42.08 the wrong. You're going to do it for. Now, part of the fun can be submitting people and you get
01:37:42.08 --> 01:37:45.84 people that that's the only fun that they have in Jiu-Jitsu is when they submit people. And that's
01:37:45.84 --> 01:37:51.76 not what I'm talking about. Yeah. I think that's kind of the transitions and the flowing and the
01:37:51.76 --> 01:37:57.60 utilization of moves and the cool things that happen. And you know, sometimes I'll be wrong with
01:37:57.60 --> 01:38:01.68 whoever. And it's like someone just like someone will do something really cool when you start laughing.
01:38:01.68 --> 01:38:07.28 Right. And that was awesome. That's Jiu-Jitsu. That's right. Jiu-Jitsu should be fun. It shouldn't be this.
01:38:07.28 --> 01:38:17.28 It shouldn't be the fun shouldn't come from just submitting people. Right. That's just bullying,
01:38:17.28 --> 01:38:22.72 right? Yeah. And way. And you know, you shouldn't get, you should at a certain point, you're going
01:38:22.72 --> 01:38:27.44 to, okay, go like and tap people out. But let's let's do this for the reason of the
01:38:27.44 --> 01:38:33.92 dysport itself, the the game itself, which is a fun game. Yeah, I think guys who told me straight
01:38:33.92 --> 01:38:39.20 up that when they're driving up to the gym, they have anxiety. Yeah. But anxiety like, oh,
01:38:39.20 --> 01:38:44.16 how am I going to do? Or if they get tapped out, it ruins their day or their week or whatever.
01:38:44.16 --> 01:38:50.80 Yeah. But man. I have none of that. Yeah. I'm rolling the jump. Jim just in totally, you know,
01:38:50.80 --> 01:38:54.88 totally happy to be able to be getting there and get and get to do something that's so fun.
01:38:54.88 --> 01:39:02.24 Yeah. Yeah. I rolled with Chris Martin today for it. And it was all, you can make jokes. You can talk
01:39:02.24 --> 01:39:07.84 trash and you can do all this stuff while you're rolling. And doing that in this playful, I mean,
01:39:07.84 --> 01:39:14.08 don't be a dick, you know, but you know, just like, yeah, you can push being a dick. Sometimes.
01:39:14.08 --> 01:39:18.08 It makes it more fun for sure. Like you can, you know, you can call him moving and do it on the
01:39:18.08 --> 01:39:22.96 guy if you're better than him or whatever. And it makes it fun though, you know. And me and Chris,
01:39:22.96 --> 01:39:27.44 we're doing that the whole time. Oh, what is this? Oh, how does that feel kind of thing? Yeah.
01:39:27.44 --> 01:39:30.56 And of course, that's taken to extreme because I know Chris for long. Yeah, we're just
01:39:30.56 --> 01:39:35.20 but talking to just a little bit of that makes it more fun. Just like if you're playing a video
01:39:35.20 --> 01:39:38.96 game, just like if you're playing any other game, just talk some friend. You know, it's it's part of
01:39:38.96 --> 01:39:44.72 the fun. Yeah. And like I said, my original point is I think people wouldn't assume that about you
01:39:44.72 --> 01:39:50.88 given how you may come off sometimes. But you're really like that. No, I do, do, do you fund
01:39:50.88 --> 01:39:59.04 me? No doubt. Unsporched for sure. But even up, do you do in a way like when you're surfing in
01:39:59.04 --> 01:40:06.88 California, there's a, there's a much harder vibe surfing in California than there is in the
01:40:06.88 --> 01:40:14.000 mats for sure. You know, when, you know, when we're surfing where I surf, like it's, it's a
01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:20.80 gang mentality type situation, you know. And so on the mats, it's just so fun to be in a situation.
01:40:20.80 --> 01:40:27.20 But and surfing, you know, leads to fighting often. Oh, yeah. And so, but in Gitu, the fighting is
01:40:27.20 --> 01:40:32.16 already happening. Right. Right. So, so it's, you know, you can, you kind of over it. And now,
01:40:32.16 --> 01:40:37.60 now we're just, we're already fighting. So now we can just chill. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So it's crazy
01:40:37.60 --> 01:40:42.24 else surfing's like that, right? So this would be this kind of thing. No, it's not. No, it's
01:40:42.24 --> 01:40:45.68 not. Yeah. No, it's impossible. It's not. It's an aggressive, it's a very aggressive environment.
01:40:45.68 --> 01:40:51.52 It's like a territorial thing. It's a very territorial thing. Yeah. Yeah. It's kind of cool. I like it.
01:40:51.52 --> 01:41:02.96 You like that. Next question. I understand and agree with all your thoughts in principles.
01:41:02.96 --> 01:41:12.24 However, however, interpret your concepts for leaders leading men, or mostly driven, or other
01:41:12.24 --> 01:41:20.56 leaders who have a desire to make themselves better and maintaining the status. Yep. So common misperception,
01:41:20.56 --> 01:41:27.28 right, is that, you know, the military and the seals. I say this all time. Everyone thinks that
01:41:27.28 --> 01:41:33.12 the military and the seals, I think that we're leading Terminator robots. Right. And everyone is just
01:41:33.12 --> 01:41:36.24 driven and they're going to get up and they're going to do everything. And it's, I just talked about
01:41:36.24 --> 01:41:42.000 this on the last podcast. It is a bell curve. It is a bell curve and there's a great bunch of guys
01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:45.44 at the top of the bell curve that are go getters. There's a solid bunch of guys in the middle.
01:41:45.44 --> 01:41:52.08 There's a load of guys that are bumps. And so this interpretation that the concepts that I talk about
01:41:52.08 --> 01:41:59.60 are just for leading these front running A personalities that just make everything happen.
01:42:01.28 --> 01:42:06.32 Not correct. You know, there are seals that don't want to work. There are seals that want to
01:42:06.32 --> 01:42:10.96 take shortcuts. There are seals that want to escape. By then you get outside. Then you work with
01:42:10.96 --> 01:42:16.64 Iraqi soldiers that are unmotivated, untrained, poorly equipped. We got to work with these guys.
01:42:16.64 --> 01:42:23.28 We got bosses. I mean, I got bosses in the seal teams that are either an e-go maniac or that are
01:42:23.28 --> 01:42:28.56 ultra riskers. You can have any of this stuff going on. You can have your guys that are
01:42:28.56 --> 01:42:33.44 riskers. You can have guys that are too crazy. You got all, you know what they are?
01:42:34.48 --> 01:42:40.32 They're humans. They're individuals. They're human beings. And because they're human beings,
01:42:40.32 --> 01:42:44.48 even in special operations. And sometimes especially in special operations. Because when you get
01:42:44.48 --> 01:42:50.88 in special operations, you guys that have huge egos and attitudes. And so, oh, you think that they just
01:42:50.88 --> 01:42:54.32 want to do whatever you tell them to do. No, they got their own idea. They got their own method.
01:42:54.32 --> 01:42:58.40 They got their own plan. They got their own what they think they're a tactical genius. So you
01:42:58.40 --> 01:43:06.32 got to get around that. So what does it mean? It means you have to lead them. And it's the common
01:43:06.32 --> 01:43:10.32 theme that I'm talking about all the time. And it was, I mean, you got to build relationships.
01:43:10.32 --> 01:43:13.52 You got to build the trust. You got to make sure they understand why they're doing what they're
01:43:13.52 --> 01:43:17.92 doing. You got to make sure they understand the strategic impact. You got to empower them. You
01:43:17.92 --> 01:43:22.88 got to set a good example. You got to listen to them. You got to take input. You got to give them
01:43:22.88 --> 01:43:29.52 response. And when I say response, I mean, real responsibility. You got to build them up. You got to
01:43:29.52 --> 01:43:40.40 make them better. You got to show them and let them see not in a, not in a in your face way. But you
01:43:40.40 --> 01:43:46.88 got to subtly let them see what self improvement means them and how they can better the position
01:43:46.88 --> 01:43:55.04 and what drive will get them. You got to give them ownership stuff. And you got to let that ownership
01:43:55.04 --> 01:44:00.32 grow into extreme ownership where they really want to own things. You got to teach them to lead.
01:44:00.32 --> 01:44:05.52 And you got to put them in leadership positions. And you got to show your trust by actually following
01:44:05.52 --> 01:44:13.36 them sometimes. And again, people ask me these questions. You know, how a new leader. How do I lead?
01:44:13.36 --> 01:44:17.68 I got a new person. How do I lead them? It's the same answers. It's the same answers all the time
01:44:17.68 --> 01:44:22.96 that principles of leadership. Now the nuances are there. Yes, the nuances are there. And I have
01:44:22.96 --> 01:44:27.20 to nuance for echo that I got a nuance for this guy over here. And I got a nuance for this group over
01:44:27.20 --> 01:44:32.88 here. The nuances are there. But the basic principles are the same. Am I never, I'm going to,
01:44:32.88 --> 01:44:36.40 who am I going to be in charge of that? I'm not going to try and build a relationship of trust with them.
01:44:36.40 --> 01:44:41.52 Who's that? The answer is nobody. You know, who is it that I don't want to set a good example for?
01:44:41.52 --> 01:44:46.56 The answer is nobody. Who is it that I'm not going to listen to? If you don't listen to people
01:44:46.56 --> 01:44:53.44 you alienate them, you don't want to be part of the team. I mean, it's, it's things are universal. And again,
01:44:53.44 --> 01:44:58.64 there's nuances because you might have to make adaptations. And you know, when we, when we did
01:44:58.64 --> 01:45:04.40 battle leadership with, with, with, uh, eight off von Schell, and he talks about distinctly these three
01:45:04.40 --> 01:45:10.08 different types of commanders and how the, the boss gave them each their own little adjusted order
01:45:10.08 --> 01:45:14.32 because he was dealing with their personalities. So yes, you got to deal with the personalities,
01:45:14.32 --> 01:45:20.16 but that doesn't mean you're doing something different from the principles. So,
01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:27.52 when you get sure, when you get to the bottom of the bell curve, you might see some people that
01:45:27.52 --> 01:45:33.68 might need to be replaced. They might need to be removed, but I'll tell you what, most likely,
01:45:35.04 --> 01:45:43.20 they just need to be led. The reason that, or I think one of the reasons why
01:45:43.20 --> 01:45:48.96 the, the perception is that all your guys are robots and, you know, I'm going to give you an order.
01:45:48.96 --> 01:45:53.68 They follow it. No question that is like movies, right? Like a few good men,
01:45:53.68 --> 01:45:59.84 member of the Jack Nicholson, he's like, people follow orders or people die. Yeah, that's his thing.
01:45:59.84 --> 01:46:04.16 And they say that kind of stuff. Yeah, and, but they do, they do capture it and somehow we would
01:46:04.16 --> 01:46:10.16 move these where they show how mute knees take place and now things go wrong and how, you know,
01:46:10.16 --> 01:46:16.24 the new Lieutenant Vietnam is going to get fragged by his own people. That stuff's real. Yeah,
01:46:16.24 --> 01:46:23.20 you know, that stuff's real. So, it's just, it's a misperception. The other misperception is because
01:46:23.20 --> 01:46:30.16 of boot camp, a lot of military movies are, they show a significant amount of time in boot camp,
01:46:30.16 --> 01:46:35.84 but boot camp is a matter of weeks, you know, career. You know, I think Marine Corps boot camp is 13
01:46:35.84 --> 01:46:41.36 weeks. I think Army boot camp is 10 weeks. Boot camp is a very short period of time and you're
01:46:42.08 --> 01:46:47.44 four year, six year, eight year, 10 year, 20 year career. Boot camp is, you know, I talked about
01:46:47.44 --> 01:46:52.40 the indoctrination all times in the military. They have very short periods of time compared to your
01:46:52.40 --> 01:46:57.52 whole career. And in boot camp, when your drone structure says drop down and do pushups, you drop down
01:46:57.52 --> 01:47:02.40 your pushups and boot camp, when your drone structure says pick up that, you know, make your bed,
01:47:02.40 --> 01:47:06.48 you make your bed when they's, and if you don't, they yell at you and they yell at you until you do
01:47:06.48 --> 01:47:11.28 make your bed. So, people get that idea that that's the way the military is run. Yeah,
01:47:11.28 --> 01:47:16.08 yeah, and that is, you know, a great example is full metal jacket, the movie, which is a great
01:47:16.08 --> 01:47:24.24 movie, but the boot camp scene is half the movie, but in reality, even if you were a guy in
01:47:24.24 --> 01:47:28.72 Vietnam, you know, boot camp is 13 weeks and then you went on to interview it in on for a year.
01:47:28.72 --> 01:47:35.60 So, it's a fraction of what your real career is like and so people get that impression that
01:47:35.60 --> 01:47:39.20 you're just going to be able to bar recorders never is going to listen you, it just doesn't work
01:47:39.20 --> 01:47:46.64 that way. And there's actually there's a great, there's a great video, it's called Charlie Company
01:47:46.64 --> 01:47:53.68 in V, anyways, I forget the name of the video, but it's about a company in Vietnam, Charlie Company,
01:47:53.68 --> 01:48:01.76 and maybe if you remind me, I'll put it on the website. It shows two company commanders,
01:48:01.76 --> 01:48:07.36 but anyways, to make a long story short, these guys, they don't like their new company commander.
01:48:08.40 --> 01:48:12.80 And at first, the resistant to him, and he says, listen, these guys,
01:48:12.80 --> 01:48:18.40 you've got to learn that there's going to have to do what I tell him. And then it fasts
01:48:18.40 --> 01:48:22.48 forwards a couple months. And they interview him again and he goes, you know, how's everything going?
01:48:22.48 --> 01:48:26.56 He goes, you know, they get it now and they realize that they just have to listen to me and do what I told him.
01:48:26.56 --> 01:48:32.16 And then they go out in the field with the guys. And the guys in the field, they're supposed to be
01:48:32.88 --> 01:48:37.76 doing things, they're just not doing them. They're just literally calm back like, yeah, we did, yeah,
01:48:37.76 --> 01:48:42.56 we did a patrol. They didn't do it. Yeah, we moved positions, they didn't move positions. Yeah,
01:48:42.56 --> 01:48:46.88 we're going to do another, you know, another football patrol tonight. They're not doing it.
01:48:46.88 --> 01:48:50.32 So, he was under the impression that everyone had like buckled to his will.
01:48:50.32 --> 01:48:53.92 Right. Right. They were just completely snowing him and he had no idea.
01:48:54.72 --> 01:49:00.96 So that's what happens in the military. If you don't lead to your people and you just order them around
01:49:00.96 --> 01:49:05.68 and you think that everyone's just this, this, this, how they described it here,
01:49:06.88 --> 01:49:11.28 then who are mostly driven or leaders who haven't desired to make themselves better. I mean,
01:49:12.16 --> 01:49:17.20 if anybody in a position with the guys like that, it's going to, the leadership job is going to be very easy.
01:49:17.20 --> 01:49:22.24 You just tell them what to do and they do it. Right. I mean, I could give you an example upon
01:49:22.24 --> 01:49:27.84 example upon example of stuff in the SEAL teams where what I had to do to get people convinced that
01:49:27.84 --> 01:49:33.20 this was the right thing to do. You know, I mean, it is like, you know, a classic example is telling
01:49:33.20 --> 01:49:38.88 guys, okay, we're going to take Iraqi soldiers on every operation. You know, so these guys were saying,
01:49:38.88 --> 01:49:43.44 are you kidding me? Well, they didn't even go, hey, cool, Joko, we'll do exactly what you tell us.
01:49:43.44 --> 01:49:46.80 Right. No, they were, what are you talking about? I'm not taking these guys out. Why would we do that?
01:49:46.80 --> 01:49:50.80 It's going to be risky. These guys aren't trustworthy. They're not trained. They're a million
01:49:50.80 --> 01:49:58.80 reasons why not to do that. But how do you get them to do it? You explain to them why you explain to
01:49:58.80 --> 01:50:03.76 them the strategic importance. You have built trust with them. You tell them that they're going
01:50:03.76 --> 01:50:07.36 to take ownership of their Iraqis. I mean, it's everything that I just said. That's what you do.
01:50:07.36 --> 01:50:15.12 That's a classic example. So, yes, once again, you have, if you're in a leadership position,
01:50:15.12 --> 01:50:22.96 you have to lead. You ever seen them movie saving private, right? Yes. Yeah, there was a part
01:50:22.96 --> 01:50:30.08 of them. And that movie that they weren't down for the orders. Remember that way, it was kind of like
01:50:30.08 --> 01:50:34.80 a little pivotal part where they were going to go take a machine gunness. And they were like,
01:50:34.80 --> 01:50:37.68 man, we don't have to do this. So they all kind of got together today. You know,
01:50:38.72 --> 01:50:43.76 seems like unnecessary risk. And he's like, he kind of tripped out a little bit and kind of forced
01:50:43.76 --> 01:50:47.12 them to do it. And they were like, all right, whatever. Kind of reluctantly than one of the
01:50:47.12 --> 01:50:52.24 guys died and stuff. But you know, that's an example. Yeah, and especially, you know, you
01:50:52.24 --> 01:50:57.68 when we were just doing talking about World War I, that one portion of the book where he says,
01:50:57.68 --> 01:51:00.80 you know what, we got to order to do this thing. I didn't feel good about it, but it was an order
01:51:00.80 --> 01:51:05.84 we were going to do it. So there's examples from the past, especially where, you know, it's
01:51:05.84 --> 01:51:09.60 definitely was more like that. And the past in World War I, obviously it was like that.
01:51:09.60 --> 01:51:13.60 Obviously it was like that. Unfortunately it was like that. Yeah. Because it caused people to
01:51:14.24 --> 01:51:21.12 continue, you know, to execute these operations that we're just going to get people killed.
01:51:21.68 --> 01:51:26.32 And you know, actually, Laefan, I were talking about that last week, pick its chart, get it, pick
01:51:26.32 --> 01:51:32.88 its charts, get his bird. They sent the troops up and they got slaughtered. And they came, you know,
01:51:32.88 --> 01:51:40.64 the survivors came back and Lee was, you know, basically in tears like, hey, I'm sorry, this happened.
01:51:40.64 --> 01:51:47.04 I, this was my fault. He took ownership of it. And I hope I'm getting the story right. But
01:51:49.12 --> 01:51:55.04 but that's the, that's the general, the general just of the story. But then that, you know,
01:51:55.04 --> 01:52:00.08 the big story was that the guys were like, hey, we'll go again if you, you know, because you're
01:52:00.08 --> 01:52:06.08 such a great leader will go again in Laef, you know, was kind of like, that's what World War,
01:52:06.08 --> 01:52:10.96 you know, that's what, that's what happened. That, that, that shows you that guys were willing.
01:52:10.96 --> 01:52:15.76 And I said, yeah, but the difference is in World War I, they sent them again. They sent them over
01:52:15.76 --> 01:52:20.000 and, you know, Lee was regretting and I'm sorry and I did something like, I got you, you know,
01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:24.40 bunch of guys killed. It's horrible in World War I and they're like, yeah, it happened, going again.
01:52:24.40 --> 01:52:28.88 Yeah. Oh, yeah, and that happens again. We're doing it again. And again, and again, and it's just
01:52:28.88 --> 01:52:39.28 to, I'll, I'll, I'll always just be horrified by that. And hopefully, um, man progresses beyond that.
01:52:39.28 --> 01:52:48.48 And again, part of that is as a person, you have to question, you have to be a rebel. You have to
01:52:48.48 --> 01:52:53.76 question what people are telling you and why they're telling it to you. If my boss doesn't tell me
01:52:53.76 --> 01:52:59.84 why I'm doing my operation, it's, and I continue to execute it. That's my fault. I need to raise my hand.
01:52:59.84 --> 01:53:04.80 It's a boss. What are we doing? Why are we doing this? I don't understand. You got to take that initiative.
01:53:05.36 --> 01:53:10.88 Because if you're just blindly following orders, I don't want somebody that's blindly following orders.
01:53:10.88 --> 01:53:17.20 I never want people that blindly following my orders. I want people that say, oh, get boss, wait. Why are we doing this?
01:53:17.20 --> 01:53:24.80 Why is this happening? Because I want people, I want think, I want leaders underneath me that know how to lead. And you know what?
01:53:24.80 --> 01:53:31.12 When you build the trust and you build the relationships, those guys will do anything for you.
01:53:31.68 --> 01:53:37.12 And my guys and my task is to do anything. I mean, I know it. They did over and over again.
01:53:37.92 --> 01:53:46.96 Did operations that were crazy and hard and dangerous and risky. Never did anyone say, oh, you know,
01:53:46.96 --> 01:53:51.12 we're not doing this. Is it okay? We understand what's the mission? All right.
01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:58.56 So you've got to build that. Well, it's against the same basic principles of leading human beings.
01:53:59.28 --> 01:54:03.52 And that's what you've got to do. But to think that you're just going to order people to do things. It's not happening.
01:54:06.16 --> 01:54:12.48 Long answer to a two a two a good question. That was actually interesting perspective. And I know it's a perspective that a lot of people have.
01:54:12.48 --> 01:54:17.68 People always think, well, you know, you led seals and they're in there. So that was easy.
01:54:17.68 --> 01:54:22.80 Yeah, but before you said, before you told me, that's kind of what I figured. Yeah.
01:54:24.80 --> 01:54:25.52 Last question.
01:54:28.96 --> 01:54:34.24 Juckle, any tips for breaking habits of laziness and procrastination?
01:54:34.88 --> 01:54:40.56 Maybe some good reads on the subject. And this is a question I wish you would answer for me like 10 years ago.
01:54:40.56 --> 01:54:42.80 So yeah, any tips?
01:54:45.44 --> 01:54:54.96 You know, this has definitely been a pretty common question when people want to know how to stop the laziness.
01:54:54.96 --> 01:55:02.24 And they want to not stop the procrastination. And you know, they have some idea in their head,
01:55:02.24 --> 01:55:11.44 you know, some kind of a vision of what they want to do. But they don't know where to start.
01:55:11.44 --> 01:55:14.48 They don't know where to start. They don't know where to start.
01:55:15.84 --> 01:55:23.36 And say, they say, hey, where do I start? And when's the best time to start? And I have a very simple answer for that.
01:55:23.36 --> 01:55:39.68 Here and now that's it. You want to improve. You want to get better. You want to get on a workout program or a clean diet.
01:55:39.68 --> 01:55:48.72 You want to start a business. You want to write a book or make a movie or build a house or a computer or put together some
01:55:48.72 --> 01:56:01.44 mobile application. Where do you start? You start right here. And when do you start? You start right now.
01:56:03.68 --> 01:56:07.20 You initiate the action aggressively. You go.
01:56:09.60 --> 01:56:15.60 Because the idea isn't going to execute itself. And the book isn't going to write itself. And the
01:56:15.60 --> 01:56:22.64 weights out in the gym. They're not going to move themselves. You have to do it. And you have to do it now.
01:56:25.20 --> 01:56:32.24 And that means you got to stop thinking about it and stop dreaming about it and stop researching every
01:56:32.24 --> 01:56:38.88 aspect of it and reading all about it and debating the pros and cons of it. Just start doing it.
01:56:38.88 --> 01:56:54.16 Take that first step and make it happen. Get after it. Get after it here and now.
01:56:54.16 --> 01:57:19.84 And I think that's all we've got for tonight. So thanks everybody for listening to this
