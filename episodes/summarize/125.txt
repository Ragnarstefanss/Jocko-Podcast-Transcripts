so these you know like if your academy allows whatever color geese want like victory does then you whatever color you want then you kind of go into this game with it the game which actually doesn't really exist really and that's like if you're a new guy and you show up with a pink geek or a crazy like you know those weird geese and a gold belt or something like how Jeff clevery so where that gold belt or was it friend you did that they bought it anyway bill cooper even if you do that then it's like Man, I remember when I started you to and this was like a few, like a year or two years in, I remember being kind of apprehensive, not apprehensive, kind of scared, actually in Endless working at the club where you kind of walk around and, you know, in the that club situation, it's that you can't know if it can be like, you don't know if this guy knows you're exactly men and where he, where it's like man, I got his humble. But I think what's more important given the stage and this is real generally speaking because people are different but learn the moves, you know the crisp like move like how to do an arm lock where your hips should be and shouldn't be and what makes it an arm lock a good arm lock and when makes an arm lock, for example a bad arm lock, you know where it's like you know how some guys can do an arm lock Like if I'm saying, you know, people say, I don't know, no one's saying, no one's saying, or like, if I say, like, I say, like, a lot, do you not like that? It's just, you know, like someone who's saying, just live in an insecure, you know, someone comes in, like, especially if you're in like a certain type of instructor and you're used to like everyone just listening to every word you say and then, I don't know, a student or someone comes with something different than what you said. I think you're right about that that's right you know to your point how you get when you want to do so it's kind of like a faint right in boxing maybe a little bit more like how you say I'm gonna when I go for a move as this as a set up move you got to really sell that move you got a really big going for that And it's weird how like when you, when you're successful in something, I don't know, whatever, even like in like life, like if you're, you're, you're, I don't know, you're career or something. I maybe I brushed my teeth too soon before I drank the milk you know something like this foul nobody see it you can do certain things that affects your little taste buds or whatever it was like that it was like it was a question mark it wasn't like But like any, any decision like situation where you're going to okay, I'm going to make the right call or the right, you know, tactics or what, you know, to get a certain result or whatever. I guess right sure then let's jocco store dot com and get some patches I got some warrior kid patches I got this will those should be on there right now actually for the warrior kids and the geese and the geese the backpack wherever you want to put down you don't represent where your kids also other patches on there too discipline equals freedom what not also psychological warfare if you didn't know what that is it's an album with tracks jocco tracks that help you through every moment of weakness that you might come across can not because apparently not all of us go through moments of weakness it's rare but some people they just power through for those types of people psychological warfare not for them I think I think they just power through and continue powering through maybe even teach us how to just power through but for the rest of us hit moments of weakness we listen to psychological warfare given what the weakness is so if my weakness is hitting the snooze and not getting up early there's a track for that it's jocco on that track talking to you telling you why you should get up not yelling he's playing the game Like, no, instead of saying, so like the first case, like if you, if you went left and said, right, you ended up getting mortars, you know, you said, well, the, I didn't expect the enemy to use mortars. So it seems like, you know, ain't given what you said that his kind of objective or his kind of outlook or his way of being when he goes into the situation is, hey, man, sure, there's, there's going to be these chance that there's going to be a chance that the result isn't going to be that good. but no we're still calling it jocco white tea in books way the warrior kid tons the series right there's two books out right now and so much awesome feedback on that it's awesome thanks for posting pictures of your kids studying reading doing book reports training jiu jitsu working out it's awesome to say thank you and if you have kids or you no kids get them on that same path if you want to support a warrior kid go to irishokes ranch.com and get some soap made by the warrior kid aiden because you know you need to see soap if you are going to stay clean don't forget about the discipline you could free them field manual same thing awesome feedback you ever heard the saying an apple a day keeps the doctor away yes not really read one section of the field manual a day I know it doesn't rhyme and part of that which I did mention I think maybe last time there's anti-inflammatory stuff in there too like natural stuff not like ibuprofen something like that like anti-inflammatory that's a good example and when when you get and you know have full of those down or you're just your general game down in that particular way then you can start like leaking into that kind of way thinking where it's like But I think generally speaking like these those types of tactics like where I'm going to go for this and then when he reacts to that thing, I went for it then I'm going to really do my real move kind of thing and there can be chains too, by the way. no he was he had a real strength he's like just mix this up you know it's like a little thing just mix this up only you know you see the thing leave the screen And also what it feels like, man, I remember thinking like this skinny guy right here, especially a tall skinny guy, who in, if you didn't know about you, just a tall skinny guy, there's one other than a non-fact, they're kind of thing. And the answer is that there's a dichotomy to this, that they're like like all of life and like all of business and like all of leadership. but then it's like soy milk or canned milk or powder milk that can be added because it wouldn't be in my house in the rest of us you know the difference that's the point you know the different lactose free milk and regular milk like the difference isn't that obvious in my opinion but I was like does this taste different like you know it's like a question it's not guaranteed it could have been me or it's like an exuser or it's fine or not or even acceptable or whatever, but it does make sense though, even like competitors, you know, like, I got it. so you've provided another layer it has been turned into layers and also you know you know how you say rock like I said well this is what I thought you know when you say rock on and you have the two fingers right point index finger I thought that was like some Viking thing the way you're having it okay hard core heavy metal to heavy metal like when you go to this it's like this Or the opposite of what you said or something that kind of indicates that what you said is 100% correct is like boom, you're going to defend that little position that you've kind of grown accustomed to, you know, especially if you're even a little bit insecure, you're going to at least have those feelings. yeah you can't talk about that one I don't know the effects good point put it this way I have never lost my temper I have never broke down and cried well the beautiful while I'm on the discipline there you go so the proof is in the pudding so it is an emotional enhancing situation as well but whatever your mission is there's some neutral pick stuff in there for cognitive enhancement and a little bit of caffeine if you're into caffeine a little bit micro dose as we call it you know that's a good one too don't run out also moke moke is moke I had some other day two scoops what is one serving one one scoop yes so leave to that on big time also on youtube subscribe if you haven't already the video version of this podcast along with excerpts little I don't know to anywhere from two to eight minutes excerpts and some enhanced excerpts on there as well but some music on there make them fun or we'll say to watch on youtube maybe some outtakes everyone's in a great while anyway there's a if you're interested in the video situation subscribe to youtube it's a good way to support also jocco as a store it's called jocco store this is where you can get all your jocco gear like discipline equals freedom shirts and hoodies rash guards some women stuff on there tank tops how do we feel about tank tops I feel great in so it worst case scenario I have a lifetime supply of jocco white tea in a can and you know I don't know what is well there's a little debate you know what you call it you know wait what you call what the jocco white tea because I was kind of thinking well there's another name we could give it we could call it 8,000 pound dead lift and it can sure Yeah so when you this is the this is the answer to when that question comes which it will when you start training GJitsu and you start training against people that know what you know or at least some of what you know they're gonna defend. So, if you start playing that game, like you start assessing what's going on, and then you start adding a layer of like what do the instructors want me to do right here. but there's a bunch going on it dot com slash jockel that's a spot good spot get something also when you are purchasing any of the books that jocquer reviews or even extreme ownership or way to work it or whatever whatever book I organized them all on jockel podcast dot com books from the episodes actually jockels books around the front page but for the books they review on the podcast books from episodes boom they're all right there click through there when you buy those books good way to support and you know carry on do you shopping But you know how guys will brag and, you know, be like, oh, it's not tournament or something like that. So again, just like a person in the military, just like a seal, just like being in the seal teams doesn't make you a good person. but it actually works it doesn't it'll keep you on track physically and mentally and if you want to speak of tracks you want to listen to it there's no audio audible version of it because we wanted to have an album with tracks you can get it on amazon news at google play iTunes other MP3 platforms the discipline equals field the discipline equals freedom field manual meditate on that all right also for leadership extreme ownership combat leadership how is this book still a best seller after two and a half years that's the question and lathe was telling a guy the other day on twitter he's like it's the same thing as when we first started working together it's a good not a good info too on there so you know if you ask me about what to do with kettlebells when you're first starting out like how much you should use or how much weight you should use and what movements I'm not the resource I'm not that versed in it I know two movements three maybe four altogether But isn't this just a bunch of semantics, though, like excuses and reasons, because really when it comes down to it, excuses like in excuse, like you're excused. but I don't think there's the word artistic on the whole website by the way so it's like primal bells that's like the you know the monkey groups grilla's orangutan let's go rock and roll I feel like I haven't worn a tank top for like probably since like a college time There's people that play the game and they play the game so that they are going to, you know, I just said this 10 times like I played a win. the joggers this past week and still yeah holds up and have some comfortable sweats I know about comfort they do not stranger to comfort you know where good that originmate dot com good spot also if you want to vary up your workout and get new workout equipment go to on it dot com slash jockel get yourself some kettlebells the artistic kettlebells a calm artistic kettlebells You know, playing the game, you know, maybe got viewed as like being agreeable. You know, you know, you know what, but it's, these guys in here's the thing, when you've been in the game long enough, you see this super clear too, right? So, you know, this guy may always talk about how good his triangle choke is or something like this, you know, this stuff. but he's like a computer guy you know he's a super genius easy like hides really well and super hard to find and all this To be an arrogant jerk though, that, that, that, I think that's like something that the human being brought into jiu-jitsu, you know, and then the jiu-jitsu kind of just mixed it, you know, mixed it. you know all this stuff you fight it's good and there's a track for all these little weaknesses good 100% effectiveness by the way get it on iTunes or wherever wherever you can buy MP3 it's on like Amazon music whatnot as well and that's because the two fingers you know like rock on and I I Reese before I released this I researched it this how I know this and and lemme from motorheads quote as to why he used the emote was because he said it looks mean that's his quote that's always said But the way that the way that I talk about the Jitsu and the way we talk about it, like everybody that does Jitsu should be some Buddha like enlightened being at one with the universe. so so that helps a lot and you know I'm rarely like super impressed with I mean not like my standard just so high but they originally made those or we originally made those as a like you know kind of like a what's it but when you set bait you can't be some fake thing and this bait has to be real like a wall you know when you try to catch a wolf the bait has to be real there can't be just some bait you bought kind of kind of idea but I always don't want to say be on the lookout for that like it's this big thing you gotta be on the lookout but kind you know if you're down for the tank tops hey be on the lookout for it So, and how it turned itself like what it morphed kind of into just by nature is like this little political game within the game.
