00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.90
This is Jockel podcast number 151 with echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink.

2
00:00:05.90 --> 00:00:14.28
Good evening, I go. Good evening. And we haven't done a Q&A for a while and we're

3
00:00:14.28 --> 00:00:22.000
going to roll into a Q&A and normally quite frankly, normally the Q&A is when we

4
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
show up for the Q&A is there's a little bit of a different atmosphere. Well, say, right?

5
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.76
We're a little bit of levity in the room. We're not going to talk about war. We're

6
00:00:32.76 --> 00:00:36.28
not going to be reading about men being wounded or killed. We're not going to be reading

7
00:00:36.28 --> 00:00:39.48
about some atrocity. And here and what people go through, we're going to be answering

8
00:00:39.48 --> 00:00:45.08
questions. And there's a little bit more just light-heartedness to the whole thing,

9
00:00:45.08 --> 00:00:51.16
usually. Sometimes it goes a little bit one way or the other. But this is, there's just a

10
00:00:51.16 --> 00:00:56.44
little bit of a different situation in the recording room right now. Because we just did a,

11
00:00:56.44 --> 00:01:01.40
and this is kind of surprising. Because we just did a war your kid podcast. And in the

12
00:01:01.40 --> 00:01:08.28
war your kid podcast, I answer questions from kids for Uncle Jake. And those are all, you

13
00:01:08.28 --> 00:01:15.24
know, kind of just little neat little kid questions. Hey, our cheeseburgers, good for you.

14
00:01:15.24 --> 00:01:19.88
And what do I do when I'm nervous that it's a Jockel tournament? And what do I do when I

15
00:01:19.88 --> 00:01:24.52
can't remember how to spell Mississippi? You know, just like these nice little kid

16
00:01:24.52 --> 00:01:30.28
questions and their fun. And yet, you know, I treat them seriously because kids have serious

17
00:01:30.28 --> 00:01:33.80
questions. And when you're a little kid, those are real problems. Those aren't, we laugh at them.

18
00:01:33.80 --> 00:01:37.88
Now you're laughing at them. No. Like, well, the Mississippi one, right? You're a real

19
00:01:37.88 --> 00:01:42.28
laughing at the kids, the issues. But then what I started doing a little while ago is I started telling

20
00:01:42.28 --> 00:01:49.16
these stories from the perspective of Uncle Jake when Uncle Jake was a kid. And some of those

21
00:01:49.16 --> 00:01:52.84
are a little bit more, they're a little bit more serious, but there's always a very big lesson

22
00:01:52.84 --> 00:01:58.12
if you learned because my goal with the stories from Uncle Jake is that kids can end up

23
00:01:58.12 --> 00:02:06.52
understanding how Uncle Jake kind of formulated his values as a man. And we've talked about a bunch

24
00:02:06.52 --> 00:02:12.20
of different ones of those. But anyways, the one that I did today and what's interesting is all these

25
00:02:12.20 --> 00:02:19.96
stories are kind of based on their based loosely around around things that I've experienced. And this

26
00:02:19.96 --> 00:02:24.76
is very, some of them very loosely, some of them not so loose on things that I've actually

27
00:02:24.76 --> 00:02:29.48
experienced things that I went through because I'm not Uncle Jake. But sure, I have some similar

28
00:02:29.48 --> 00:02:35.40
experiences that Uncle Jake has had along the way. And anyways, today I wanted to make the point

29
00:02:35.40 --> 00:02:42.04
to kids that the decisions that they make in their life are they have a big impact, right? And if

30
00:02:42.04 --> 00:02:46.52
you make little decisions when you're a kid, you start making bad decisions when you're a little

31
00:02:46.52 --> 00:02:52.76
kid, those bad decisions eventually add up. And if you make good decisions, those decisions will add

32
00:02:52.76 --> 00:02:56.28
up and you'll in the one case you'll end up with good things. If you make good decisions, if you

33
00:02:56.28 --> 00:03:01.08
make bad decisions, you'll end up in a bad situation. And I told this story from Uncle Jake's perspective

34
00:03:01.08 --> 00:03:07.16
about Uncle Jake's best friend when he was grown up and it was a kid named Jeff and they were

35
00:03:07.16 --> 00:03:11.32
best friends. They did everything together and they they played and they did practical jokes and they

36
00:03:11.32 --> 00:03:16.36
laughed an out of great time. And eventually Jeff starts making some bad decisions. He gets in trouble

37
00:03:16.36 --> 00:03:20.84
in class and he gets in more trouble than he gets suspended from recess and just and then the next thing

38
00:03:20.84 --> 00:03:29.88
you know, he starts really going down a bad path and starts using drugs in alcohol and eventually

39
00:03:29.88 --> 00:03:33.32
and again, this is a long, this is not a long story, but it's probably takes about 10 minutes to

40
00:03:33.32 --> 00:03:41.56
tell on the podcast on the warrior kid podcast and then eventually I leave high school, we graduate

41
00:03:41.56 --> 00:03:46.04
from high school and I kind of talk about seeing him and this is what's true like so this is true.

42
00:03:46.04 --> 00:03:49.32
So this is based on true story. I had a best friend when I was a kid. His name was Jeff. He was an

43
00:03:49.32 --> 00:03:54.60
awesome kid. He was funny and what he's one of those kids, I've talked about this before like

44
00:03:54.60 --> 00:04:01.80
some kids they have a little spark to him and it's not a lot. It's very few kids. They have this

45
00:04:01.80 --> 00:04:05.96
little spark. They've got this little thing about them that you go okay that person has something.

46
00:04:05.96 --> 00:04:12.12
Now that spark doesn't guarantee anything. In fact that spark can be a problem because that spark

47
00:04:12.12 --> 00:04:18.20
can catch fire and it can be an uncontrollable fire or it can be a fire that can be used to fuel and

48
00:04:18.20 --> 00:04:23.08
grow and create awesome things and you don't really know, you can't really control it. That

49
00:04:23.08 --> 00:04:27.32
person has to have control of that spark. Well Jeff was one of those kids that had like this

50
00:04:27.32 --> 00:04:34.04
spark. He was charismatic. He was funny. He was smart. He was a witty. He was courageous but he just

51
00:04:34.04 --> 00:04:39.80
for whatever reason had like a little spin to him that didn't mind getting in trouble. It's almost

52
00:04:39.80 --> 00:04:47.24
like an attitude like hey these guys can't hold me down and so you know when we were in fifth grade

53
00:04:47.24 --> 00:04:51.80
it was actually in fifth grade where we sat next to each other every day and we would start you know

54
00:04:51.80 --> 00:04:57.48
we would just hang out all the time and laugh and eventually he started getting in trouble and I

55
00:04:57.48 --> 00:05:01.88
didn't right and I would get in some trouble but he would cross the line and he'd cross the line

56
00:05:01.88 --> 00:05:07.48
to where all of a sudden you know he would get it sent to the principal's office and be that kind of

57
00:05:07.48 --> 00:05:10.84
trouble. One level above that kind of trouble I would get in which is like hey

58
00:05:12.28 --> 00:05:17.16
get yelled at you got to be quiet. Hey you know you go sit in the corner those things I got

59
00:05:17.16 --> 00:05:23.16
but I didn't cross the line which is hey I'm not I'm out of control in the class. I'm so disruptive

60
00:05:23.16 --> 00:05:28.36
that you got to get me out of class I never crossed that line. He started crossing that line and

61
00:05:29.72 --> 00:05:34.52
eventually you know like and I told in the story you know he started using drugs and I'll call

62
00:05:34.52 --> 00:05:37.72
and I thought about it. What do I want to talk about drugs now call in the warrior kid podcast

63
00:05:38.36 --> 00:05:42.76
and then I thought to myself yes I do because if you don't think kids here about drugs now call

64
00:05:42.76 --> 00:05:48.20
right now when they're seven years old eight years old nine years old you're wrong drugs are out there

65
00:05:48.20 --> 00:05:52.92
it's a different world and you might as well tell them when they're young that these things are

66
00:05:52.92 --> 00:05:58.36
problematic well with Jeff you know Jeff went down the path of starting you know smoke and

67
00:05:58.36 --> 00:06:03.80
drink and and all that stuff doing drugs and I didn't I you know he started getting into

68
00:06:04.44 --> 00:06:09.08
that kind of thing I started getting into like hardcore music and being like disciplined and

69
00:06:09.08 --> 00:06:15.48
all that stuff which again and I call it what you want call to trend call it me conforming to something

70
00:06:16.12 --> 00:06:19.80
whatever you want to call it but that's what I did that's what I got into I related to it let me

71
00:06:19.80 --> 00:06:25.32
put it to that way so eventually Jeff becomes like a burnout you know what I mean he he becomes

72
00:06:26.84 --> 00:06:32.76
yeah like a burnout you know he cut classes and he you know just kind of went down that spiral

73
00:06:33.40 --> 00:06:36.36
and the weird thing is we were such good friends when were your kids at it we didn't

74
00:06:36.36 --> 00:06:42.04
not like each other anymore you know I didn't like have a falling out with them we just we just

75
00:06:42.04 --> 00:06:48.20
went our separate ways and so when I would see him in school I'd seem in the hallway you

76
00:06:48.20 --> 00:06:55.48
I'd see him in town you know we were talk and you could see I could see in his eyes like in his eyes

77
00:06:55.48 --> 00:07:00.84
like he knew he was going in the wrong direction and we would still laugh and we would still have

78
00:07:00.84 --> 00:07:06.28
a good time we would joke about things and then we'd we'd walk away from each other and he'd keep

79
00:07:06.28 --> 00:07:11.16
kept going down the path he was going down and I kept going down the path I was going on and as time

80
00:07:11.16 --> 00:07:16.44
went by you know he just was a complete burnout I thought I don't even remember if he graduated high

81
00:07:16.44 --> 00:07:23.16
school or not I graduated high school and I joined the Navy and you know I was going to go try and

82
00:07:23.16 --> 00:07:29.000
be a seal that was my big big goal right and he was going to do whatever he was going to do

83
00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:36.60
and the last time I saw him again like I remember I saw him and it was like in my mind and it

84
00:07:36.60 --> 00:07:43.72
wasn't quite mature enough to really recognize what I saw like at the time but as I look back

85
00:07:43.72 --> 00:07:51.08
on it was like there was like this element of sadness for him seeing that I was going I was like

86
00:07:51.88 --> 00:07:56.92
for lack of a better word like getting away right I was going to go I was going to go do something

87
00:07:56.92 --> 00:08:01.72
right and he was going to not and you could see that and at this point like I don't even know if

88
00:08:01.72 --> 00:08:05.96
he could have gotten the military he'd been quite a bit of trouble and had used a lot of drugs and

89
00:08:05.96 --> 00:08:10.52
I don't even know if he could have gotten in the military at this point so and but when we were

90
00:08:10.52 --> 00:08:15.48
little kids mind you we were running around playing BB gun wars and you know setting up

91
00:08:15.48 --> 00:08:20.12
forts and running around and came off was out fits you know that's what we were doing so it's

92
00:08:20.12 --> 00:08:23.88
like I was going to do that for real and he was going to keep doing what he was doing which was

93
00:08:23.88 --> 00:08:31.88
not good stuff and so when I saw him for the last time you know like we shook hands and again like

94
00:08:31.88 --> 00:08:40.60
I could see in his eyes this this element of sadness that he was doing what his life had gone

95
00:08:40.60 --> 00:08:45.16
in this direction and my life had gone in this other direction and he was I don't even want to

96
00:08:45.16 --> 00:08:48.68
use the term jealous because I don't think he was jealous he wasn't jealous at all he was to absolutely

97
00:08:48.68 --> 00:08:54.44
he was actually like kind of proud you could see in his eyes like man that's awesome and he said

98
00:08:54.44 --> 00:08:59.64
like good luck you know and we shook hands and it broke hugged and then I then I just you know

99
00:08:59.64 --> 00:09:03.88
I left it during the Navy and went to boot camp and and I remember I was in the seal training

100
00:09:05.08 --> 00:09:10.28
and I was probably a month or two in the seal training and I talked to my mom and

101
00:09:12.76 --> 00:09:18.28
she told me that if this guy this guy Jeff would been my best friend from probably first grade through

102
00:09:18.28 --> 00:09:26.20
like fifth grade and then like I said it separated but he killed himself and 19 years old killed himself

103
00:09:27.40 --> 00:09:31.80
and so in the in the story that Uncle Jake tells I don't tell that part I don't talk about suicide

104
00:09:32.36 --> 00:09:38.12
but I just say that he died and he died from drugs now call which indirectly is true

105
00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.80
you know that's what killed him is that he was doing drugs and drinking and he wasn't making

106
00:09:43.80 --> 00:09:49.96
clear decisions and went down that path of depression and ended up killing himself and

107
00:09:50.52 --> 00:09:54.28
and I remember going you know I was going through seal training so I was you know definitely

108
00:09:55.08 --> 00:10:01.40
shocked and and saddened by it and I had to do work and it was one of those things but as I

109
00:10:01.40 --> 00:10:08.20
looked back on it like these were just little tiny decisions like I made a decision he made a decision

110
00:10:08.20 --> 00:10:13.56
he made a decision I made a positive decision about something he made a negative decision

111
00:10:13.56 --> 00:10:17.16
I made a good decision he made a bad decision these aren't huge decisions that I'm talking about

112
00:10:17.88 --> 00:10:24.04
but it was these little tiny decisions that added up over time and I think a lot of times

113
00:10:24.04 --> 00:10:28.68
kids they don't recognize that they don't recognize that these little I mean sure if you make a

114
00:10:28.68 --> 00:10:32.84
one big bad decision you go drinking and driving you're right you can you can kill yourself

115
00:10:32.84 --> 00:10:37.32
you can kill someone else you can ruin your whole life and one bad decision but where did that

116
00:10:37.32 --> 00:10:40.76
one bad decision came from it came from a bunch of bad decisions it came from hanging around

117
00:10:40.76 --> 00:10:44.92
with the bad people it came with starting to drink in the first place it came with even having the

118
00:10:44.92 --> 00:10:47.96
attitude that I can get away with stuff like there's a lot of little bad decisions that led up

119
00:10:47.96 --> 00:10:55.48
to this one bad big bad decision that actually ends up putting you in a bad way so that's the story

120
00:10:56.20 --> 00:11:02.28
that I just told on the warrior kid podcast and again I know it's kind of a heavy story

121
00:11:02.28 --> 00:11:07.48
in fact it's a very heavy story and that's another thing with like as I said to myself well

122
00:11:07.48 --> 00:11:12.92
should I talk about should I say that he ended up in jail or something like that

123
00:11:14.04 --> 00:11:21.48
and I said to myself no like this is the reality of life and if kids are not taught the

124
00:11:21.48 --> 00:11:26.44
reality of life again you're not trying to smack them in the face with it I'm not trying to

125
00:11:26.44 --> 00:11:32.60
to make them paranoid you know and that's kind of why I thought the suicide part was a step too far

126
00:11:32.60 --> 00:11:38.76
but you know it's like in Mikey and the dragons I talk about how there's dragons that are ready to kill

127
00:11:40.12 --> 00:11:45.32
and luckily you know I'm publishing I own the publishing company that's making this book because

128
00:11:45.80 --> 00:11:53.96
a lot of my editors probably wouldn't like to hear that a normal children's editor doesn't want to

129
00:11:53.96 --> 00:12:00.92
hear killing right and as and and also in the book the the king dies right the the king is dead

130
00:12:00.92 --> 00:12:07.48
and he's there's a funeral form and that's another thing like well do you really want to talk

131
00:12:07.48 --> 00:12:12.20
about that with little kids and as I asked myself that question for the first time I answered it in like a

132
00:12:12.20 --> 00:12:18.68
milliseconds with there's kids out there whose dad dies when they're five years old whose mom dies

133
00:12:18.68 --> 00:12:22.92
when they're seven years old whose grandma dies who's dog dies like death is part of life

134
00:12:23.56 --> 00:12:27.32
and to pretend that it doesn't exist and hope that your kids are just going to one day

135
00:12:27.32 --> 00:12:34.44
figure it out that's not the right thing to do they should understand it and so the the last part

136
00:12:34.44 --> 00:12:41.80
about this thing about Jeff was you know again he had this spark he was funny and he was just a really

137
00:12:41.80 --> 00:12:48.92
good awesome guy and I when I got done you know what I did I did like the typical

138
00:12:49.80 --> 00:12:55.40
whatever 11 o'clock at night sitting at the computer thing when I got done writing this thing

139
00:12:55.40 --> 00:13:00.20
and I just googled him I just googled him and just googled his name is full name and

140
00:13:02.36 --> 00:13:09.96
it was the weirdest thing because when I googled him there was nothing there was nothing

141
00:13:10.60 --> 00:13:16.92
no nothing not a name you couldn't his name no obituary no nothing just nothing

142
00:13:16.92 --> 00:13:26.52
and that kind of shook me up a little bit and the way it shakes me up is it shakes me up in the fact that

143
00:13:28.68 --> 00:13:35.56
that guy had more intelligence than me he had more talent than me he was more charismatic than me

144
00:13:35.56 --> 00:13:44.44
he had all these things that were better than me and yet google which I don't know if you ever

145
00:13:44.44 --> 00:13:47.72
googled like as I google a lot of stuff all the time because I google you know people that

146
00:13:47.72 --> 00:13:55.24
were in the military I google authors poets people that wrote some random like I'll find online

147
00:13:55.24 --> 00:14:00.68
some letter from some Lance corporal in World War II I'll google that person and guess what that

148
00:14:00.68 --> 00:14:05.24
person will there'll be article about them there'll be there'll be his obituary about what he did with

149
00:14:05.24 --> 00:14:11.40
his life and that's that's what it was wife and his wife died in 19 you know 68 and she had done

150
00:14:11.40 --> 00:14:18.04
and so you can get so much information about just anyone anyone and so I googled my friend Jeff

151
00:14:19.16 --> 00:14:28.28
and there's nothing nothing and that's a person that Jeff had he gone down the right path

152
00:14:29.16 --> 00:14:33.24
he would have left a giant mark on the world and would have done a lot of positive things

153
00:14:33.24 --> 00:14:39.08
and done beautiful things in the world and to think that it's all gone and it's all lost

154
00:14:39.08 --> 00:14:46.44
it's lost and there's not a damn thing about him so teacher kids to make the right decisions

155
00:14:46.44 --> 00:14:56.36
is what I'm saying yeah so so much for the like I said so much for the levity of the of the

156
00:14:56.36 --> 00:15:06.60
situation or of the podcast yeah I mean yes crazy how like you know obviously I didn't know Jeff

157
00:15:06.60 --> 00:15:13.08
but like how you say you're talking earlier how you know if you would have made maybe even three

158
00:15:13.88 --> 00:15:18.84
three good decisions you know because like this problem like drugs and alcohol and stuff like that

159
00:15:18.84 --> 00:15:23.40
as an individual problem that's not the maker or the breaker right there it's like everything put

160
00:15:23.40 --> 00:15:27.88
together you know there's people who are successful that may struggle with drugs and alcohol even

161
00:15:27.88 --> 00:15:36.12
for a little bit for a long time on going like you know you don't have to die you know if you

162
00:15:36.12 --> 00:15:43.24
make the decision to do the mistake in my opinion but to do drugs and drink alcohol you know or have

163
00:15:43.24 --> 00:15:47.96
that kind of hold you back or whatever you don't have to die from that it's like everything you know

164
00:15:47.96 --> 00:15:56.36
and he could have been potentially like massively successful you know just because of decisions

165
00:15:56.36 --> 00:16:01.80
that's that's the horrible thing about it is you just see the waste of human potential I guess

166
00:16:01.80 --> 00:16:07.16
that's to me is the this is a horrible thing and and I got these great memories like I got them right now

167
00:16:07.16 --> 00:16:15.08
I can remember doing things with him and and when you're with someone like that and you're almost

168
00:16:15.08 --> 00:16:21.24
like a spectator to their life like you're get to watch him you get to go like wow look at what

169
00:16:21.24 --> 00:16:27.08
he's doing this is crazy wow look at that look how funny he is you get to be a spectator and

170
00:16:27.08 --> 00:16:32.76
you appreciate I did I appreciate it and right now I look back and I think about how funny and

171
00:16:32.76 --> 00:16:39.16
you know I think about any random you know stand up comedian or someone on a Saturday night

172
00:16:39.16 --> 00:16:42.52
live or something like that and it's like yeah I know he would have been awesome on that show

173
00:16:42.52 --> 00:16:49.56
you've been hilarious on that show but never gonna happen it's not doesn't exist and

174
00:16:49.56 --> 00:16:57.72
yeah so so those little decisions that people make and that kids make especially you know it's

175
00:16:57.72 --> 00:17:02.12
weird to use when you're 19 years old think about think about how much you thought you knew when you

176
00:17:02.12 --> 00:17:09.88
were 19 and how much you actually know knew when you were 19 it's it's it's a pathetic it's

177
00:17:09.88 --> 00:17:15.88
you know so little when you're 19 you know so little when you're 19 yeah

178
00:17:15.88 --> 00:17:21.88
man I feel like you kind of know it well I don't know people different but man even

179
00:17:22.92 --> 00:17:29.48
29 for sure I feel like it and I know I every five years that you look back you realize

180
00:17:29.48 --> 00:17:33.88
that you didn't know anything five years ago yeah and maybe someone will chime in and tell me

181
00:17:33.88 --> 00:17:40.68
that when you're 72 you feel pretty good about what you know but I don't think so I don't think so

182
00:17:40.68 --> 00:17:45.64
I think it's just always constantly looking back five years and think to yourself and you know I

183
00:17:45.64 --> 00:17:51.88
said before I was like I think when you get to be at some point it's some some decade along there 35 40

184
00:17:51.88 --> 00:17:58.92
you at least say I know I don't know everything and that is like the beginning of

185
00:17:59.72 --> 00:18:03.72
knowing something because when you're like you like you said when you're 19 you know you think you

186
00:18:03.72 --> 00:18:07.88
know everything when you're 23 you think you know everything when you're 26 you think you know everything

187
00:18:07.88 --> 00:18:14.04
when you're 31 you still think you know everything it's not until you actually look up maybe that's

188
00:18:14.04 --> 00:18:18.92
35 maybe that's 37 maybe some people get it younger where they realize you know what I don't know

189
00:18:18.92 --> 00:18:27.08
everything and I need to learn more so there you go you're in a learning more yeah Q&A

190
00:18:28.68 --> 00:18:36.04
the people have some questions let's see if jockel as the answers I don't I don't necessarily have the

191
00:18:36.04 --> 00:18:43.80
answers the no but I have I will be able to give my assessment sure I will say this and I just

192
00:18:43.80 --> 00:18:50.92
got done telling Pete this sure yesterday and I probably have told you this before if I ever tell you

193
00:18:50.92 --> 00:19:01.24
I know something 100% then it's factually true but I do that so rarely it's very rare that I say hey

194
00:19:01.24 --> 00:19:08.52
here's the answer I probably do that I do that very very seldom if you hear me say that

195
00:19:09.80 --> 00:19:15.000
go with it it's correct you know barely hear me you probably you may have never heard me say that

196
00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:20.92
up until this point nothing I can't remember yeah I very rarely will say hey look I know this

197
00:19:20.92 --> 00:19:26.12
100% I used to say it once every maybe twice every six months like when I was in the two teams

198
00:19:26.12 --> 00:19:31.40
I would every once in a while I'd have to say listen man I'm telling you this is how you want to do this

199
00:19:32.28 --> 00:19:38.12
you you this is how you should do this I'm telling you you do it this way very seldom most of

200
00:19:38.12 --> 00:19:42.76
times I look this is what I think you should do but it's your decision you can do what you want

201
00:19:44.44 --> 00:19:49.08
all right well so I will give my assessment I'll give my best possible and the other thing is these

202
00:19:49.08 --> 00:19:54.76
questions are there's not a lot of detail to them often or there's a ton of detail but even

203
00:19:54.76 --> 00:19:58.84
a ton of detail isn't like let me talk oh you got a problem with your boss I need to meet your

204
00:19:58.84 --> 00:20:03.40
boss I need to talk to him you interact with him every day I don't yeah so you need to kind of

205
00:20:03.40 --> 00:20:09.64
you need to kind of modulate and and hone the answers to your particular scenario you

206
00:20:11.24 --> 00:20:17.64
so what do you think about this particular scenario okay is it better to work in a mindless job

207
00:20:17.64 --> 00:20:25.96
and make money or is it better to follow your passion and possibly make less money I definitely think

208
00:20:25.96 --> 00:20:31.48
the best thing to do is work it a job that you're passionate about and make a lot of money that's

209
00:20:31.48 --> 00:20:38.36
that's the best thing to do I do know that one that's not always possible and here's something

210
00:20:38.36 --> 00:20:45.56
you got to be careful of if you ever heard people talk about making your hobby your job right and

211
00:20:45.56 --> 00:20:52.04
generally that's like oh if I make my hobby my job then I'll enjoy my job right there's another

212
00:20:52.04 --> 00:20:59.000
way of looking at it if you make your hobby your job you won't like your hobby anymore yeah that's

213
00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:04.68
another way of looking at that so it depends on what kind of like a GG2 instructor right hey I'll

214
00:21:04.68 --> 00:21:09.40
just open my own school then I'll just get to do what I love all day long you talk to a lot of

215
00:21:09.40 --> 00:21:14.84
GG2 instructors after six years they don't even like go into the academy they don't want to go

216
00:21:14.84 --> 00:21:20.04
to the academy anymore because it's all is oh yeah I don't want to teach it one other white belt

217
00:21:20.04 --> 00:21:27.64
how to do it on our mocker over it so it's not necessarily the best thing to make what you're

218
00:21:27.64 --> 00:21:31.88
passionate about and there's some people that teach you to do every single day and they love it

219
00:21:31.88 --> 00:21:37.24
and that's awesome and so they've they've won right because they're making money they're doing

220
00:21:37.24 --> 00:21:44.76
they're having a good livelihood and they enjoy doing it so yeah but my goal would be to do something

221
00:21:44.76 --> 00:21:50.04
that I'm passionate about at the same time you got to set yourself up so that you're not stuck

222
00:21:50.04 --> 00:21:54.44
without any money right because passion doesn't pay the rent I'll tell you an example of this

223
00:21:55.16 --> 00:22:03.24
Greg Train sure years ago Greg Train said to me hey here's my options I can like kind of

224
00:22:03.24 --> 00:22:12.36
scrape by teach wrestling teach some GG2 and train to fight or I can guy got accepted into this program

225
00:22:12.36 --> 00:22:18.44
to be an x-ray technician and he asked me he's like what do you what do you think I should do this

226
00:22:18.44 --> 00:22:24.28
is a long time ago it's probably like 10 or 12 years ago maybe even longer anyway so he asked me

227
00:22:24.28 --> 00:22:32.44
and I said listen how many hours a day do you want to train and I said how many hours they can you train

228
00:22:33.40 --> 00:22:38.04
and he's like I don't know maybe three or four hours a day okay so if you want to do this three or

229
00:22:38.04 --> 00:22:42.28
four hours a day and you're not going to make any money what you're going to do with the other

230
00:22:42.28 --> 00:22:51.24
whatever 20 hours a day you could actually build a career and make real money doing the x-ray thing

231
00:22:51.96 --> 00:22:58.60
and then you could still easily because you work eight hours a day I was like I was like Greg

232
00:22:59.24 --> 00:23:04.76
I work 12 hours a day I work 14 hours they I'm still here training you can work in eight

233
00:23:04.76 --> 00:23:10.04
hour a day and still train and you can train four hours a day and you can be fine and you'll have money

234
00:23:10.04 --> 00:23:13.32
you don't have to worry about paying the rent you don't have to deal with the buy you know nice things

235
00:23:13.32 --> 00:23:20.60
you'll have medical insurance all those things and he made the decision to go to x-ray school and he ended

236
00:23:20.60 --> 00:23:25.48
up doing great in GG2 and doing great in fighting and he ended up getting some injuries that were

237
00:23:25.48 --> 00:23:30.60
like if he would have just been a fighter they would have been really problematic because you know he

238
00:23:30.60 --> 00:23:38.20
couldn't fight for a long time he so that's the kind of that's the kind of judgment call right you can make

239
00:23:40.20 --> 00:23:45.24
now what what this question is saying though is can you do something when you make a little bit

240
00:23:45.24 --> 00:23:50.12
last put your passion about that's that's pretty easy call as far as I would start if you just

241
00:23:50.12 --> 00:23:55.56
make a little bit last put you love doing it well that's kind of a no-brainer right isn't it

242
00:23:55.56 --> 00:24:01.40
now you gotta ask yourself where does that put you in the future and then you gotta ask yourself

243
00:24:02.04 --> 00:24:07.96
on the other side is could you do this job that you don't really like for long enough that you could

244
00:24:07.96 --> 00:24:12.84
make a difference like you could do this job that you don't like and you all said you got a down payment

245
00:24:12.84 --> 00:24:18.60
for a house and then you go by a house you see what I'm saying yeah so that's that's not a bad movie

246
00:24:18.60 --> 00:24:25.32
a bad move either but you could also this is where people trap themselves they have the job that

247
00:24:25.32 --> 00:24:31.56
didn't like they're making a little bit more money and instead of investing towards getting out of that

248
00:24:31.56 --> 00:24:35.88
job and setting themselves up so where they can do something that they are passionate what they do is they

249
00:24:36.84 --> 00:24:43.48
expand their lifestyle yeah that's the big mistake they expand their lifestyle and all of a sudden

250
00:24:43.48 --> 00:24:49.000
you know they're making a hundred thousand dollars a year at this job that they don't really like

251
00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:55.08
the other job they were gonna get seventy five thousand dollars a year and that that's not bad right

252
00:24:55.08 --> 00:24:58.84
I would probably go for the thing that I really like doing if it's a difference of twenty five thousand

253
00:24:58.84 --> 00:25:04.12
dollars that's kind of a no-brainer to me what does the person do they say okay well I'll just stay in

254
00:25:04.12 --> 00:25:08.52
this job so I can make enough money to get a down payment on a house and then what do they do they buy a

255
00:25:08.52 --> 00:25:13.08
new car they go out to dinner every night they spend that extra twenty five thousand that they could

256
00:25:13.08 --> 00:25:16.92
be putting into saving up for down payment they spend it on stuff that they don't need to end up with

257
00:25:16.92 --> 00:25:21.24
a hundred and ten thousand dollar lifestyle while they're making a hundred thousand dollars a year

258
00:25:21.24 --> 00:25:25.88
and they actually go into debt and now they're further away from the job that they wanted yeah

259
00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:33.08
so I guess the answer here is and I've said this before come up with an exit strategy

260
00:25:33.80 --> 00:25:41.000
with contingencies if things go wrong and then plan save prepare and then execute

261
00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:49.64
you you meet somes like a good plan good take on it what's something they I found that when you

262
00:25:49.64 --> 00:25:54.52
make your hobby your career there a lot of times like when you have fantasies about doing your

263
00:25:54.52 --> 00:25:58.92
hobby as a crit let's say I'm a photographer right that's a big one that's a common one that's heard

264
00:26:00.52 --> 00:26:04.20
there'll be like okay because I like taking pictures I like you know I don't know maybe traveling

265
00:26:04.20 --> 00:26:09.24
or I don't know whatever whatever I like taking pictures of I like that kind of subject to uh but

266
00:26:09.24 --> 00:26:16.36
so a lot of things when you're you know a creative person or you're into let's say you make baskets

267
00:26:17.16 --> 00:26:22.04
you make the awesome baskets but to make it your career a lot of the times it comes with like

268
00:26:22.76 --> 00:26:30.12
50% if that a hundred percent additional chores and tasks but running that business yeah I was

269
00:26:30.12 --> 00:26:35.32
going to say yeah you like making baskets oh yeah cool and what you end up doing is making

270
00:26:35.32 --> 00:26:40.76
thousands of the same baskets that you put their green with the Easter Bunny in it and that's

271
00:26:40.76 --> 00:26:44.68
what your job is to weave that basket over and over again everything that you're doing it for is

272
00:26:44.68 --> 00:26:49.96
now gone yeah and and guess what you have to do it and you have to do you have to like it as a hobby

273
00:26:49.96 --> 00:26:56.52
that's kind of in my opinion pretty much the one of the two things that make a hobby so great is because

274
00:26:56.52 --> 00:27:01.56
it's fun to do and you don't want everyone as long as you have the time as long as you do whenever you

275
00:27:01.56 --> 00:27:05.40
want if you don't feel like that if you don't do it like if you don't feel like golfing tomorrow you

276
00:27:05.40 --> 00:27:10.44
yeah or you don't feel like golfing or are you gonna go no no no you know of course not you don't

277
00:27:10.44 --> 00:27:15.48
have to but if you love making baskets and you don't feel like it and you're like I guess what you

278
00:27:15.48 --> 00:27:18.84
gotta make a thousand of those I know you don't feel like you've been making one you gotta make a

279
00:27:18.84 --> 00:27:23.08
thousand or make sure they're done or something like man I used to love this thing now I don't

280
00:27:23.08 --> 00:27:26.92
really like it because all this pressure which had nothing to do with my hobby by the way nothing

281
00:27:26.92 --> 00:27:31.56
now it has everything to do with my hobby now you got I had not have people calling me saying hey

282
00:27:31.56 --> 00:27:35.96
where is my basket hey I'm the basket maker I say when the basket gets made kind of thing

283
00:27:35.96 --> 00:27:42.52
that's gone so yeah so you don't really like it and so yeah you got the repetitiveness the

284
00:27:42.52 --> 00:27:48.12
like we call lack of control lack of control the pressure the pressure and then that's not

285
00:27:48.12 --> 00:27:56.84
mentioned like the day to day chores that allow your hobby activity to be a business or or

286
00:27:56.84 --> 00:28:04.60
career whatever man it's a lot like freaking taxes and taxes doing all the yeah man you know

287
00:28:04.60 --> 00:28:09.000
how like when you're you work at like a job and the taxes are just taking out the taxes

288
00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:14.68
taking out and all this stuff but man you're weaving baskets you know in your in your new garage or

289
00:28:14.68 --> 00:28:19.24
whatever man you gotta do taxes all this I don't know man this is just a lot more to it

290
00:28:19.24 --> 00:28:25.56
we'll see a child from hobby to career yeah that's true so that's my my shout out to my tax guy

291
00:28:26.20 --> 00:28:34.12
man he rocks so hard is the best guy ever yeah I can dig it but yeah so there's that and then

292
00:28:34.12 --> 00:28:38.20
but yeah if you're prepared for that though if you're totally prepared for that or if you kind of

293
00:28:38.20 --> 00:28:42.68
like business you know that part of it because there's a lot of chores in business yeah and if you

294
00:28:42.68 --> 00:28:47.64
like that stuff oh man that can be good but yeah and oh and here's the thing too about when you

295
00:28:47.64 --> 00:28:52.44
get a good job I'm not a good job but a high paying job but you don't like it this is why this is

296
00:28:52.44 --> 00:28:59.24
what I think anyway I don't think I've ever had a junk job that paid a lot you just had junk

297
00:28:59.24 --> 00:29:05.72
low paying jobs yes yes yes so I had a few of those yes for sure so okay I go I wake up I go to

298
00:29:05.72 --> 00:29:11.56
my job drag myself to my job right drag myself and then I can't wait to get home and get home and

299
00:29:11.56 --> 00:29:16.84
get that paycheck after a week two weeks or whatever get that huge paycheck then I got to drag myself

300
00:29:16.84 --> 00:29:23.40
to my job again and I go home and I can let me read so basically your day to day for that junk job

301
00:29:23.40 --> 00:29:28.44
is so junk I need something I need pleasure I need some pleasure in my life by that cool new car so

302
00:29:28.44 --> 00:29:33.08
now oh sure I'll drag myself to my job but at least I'm rolling in that new nice new car

303
00:29:33.08 --> 00:29:37.40
or but eventually you trap yourself with that car that car is right trap because that becomes

304
00:29:37.40 --> 00:29:41.88
the focus a lot of times yeah you know like to make up and I believe so this is an interesting

305
00:29:41.88 --> 00:29:46.92
thing I've thought about people like to make things people like to make things like it's it's

306
00:29:46.92 --> 00:29:52.68
it's a good feeling to make something to create something and I think a lot of the consumer

307
00:29:53.48 --> 00:29:59.72
attitude comes from the fact that look I don't have time to go and build the desk and I wish I

308
00:29:59.72 --> 00:30:03.72
did have time to go build a desk but I'll just go click on this button and the desk will show up

309
00:30:03.72 --> 00:30:11.000
my house and it's kind of like I create it something yeah well there it is and that gives you that

310
00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:17.24
but the thing is it's a short term gratification yeah that's why it keeps going because you go okay

311
00:30:17.24 --> 00:30:20.68
I really like to make a desk but I'm just gonna buy this one or I'd really like to you know what I love

312
00:30:20.68 --> 00:30:26.52
to do is just is just completely refurbish an old car oh I can't do that but guess what I can

313
00:30:26.52 --> 00:30:31.64
I can just buy a new car and then I'm rolling it feels good for a minute but you don't get the

314
00:30:31.64 --> 00:30:36.12
pure you don't get the deep satisfaction that you would have gotten had you refurbished the car

315
00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:41.72
so you get you drop yourself so keep your spending and check this is another part of this whole deal

316
00:30:41.72 --> 00:30:45.80
yeah spending and check but that's spending feels so good and then you know how like

317
00:30:46.68 --> 00:30:51.08
it depends because there's sometimes when you don't have a lot of money spending hurts

318
00:30:52.36 --> 00:30:56.84
you know it hurts when you're like I can't separate myself from this money yeah and you have

319
00:30:56.84 --> 00:31:01.24
you have a different mindset I think but I think like a your average person me included

320
00:31:01.24 --> 00:31:06.92
is like the the spending hurts when you spend spend on stuff you need rather than what you

321
00:31:06.92 --> 00:31:13.16
like want you know that's so backwards that's so bad but it's a short term thing for sure it's

322
00:31:13.16 --> 00:31:19.56
like the immediate like satisfaction is like when you got to pay let's say you you don't really have

323
00:31:19.56 --> 00:31:23.64
dentoin shirts right or let's say you do but you still got to pay out of all whatever you have to

324
00:31:23.64 --> 00:31:29.96
spend your money on that it's a $1,000 and you have $1,500 in your bank account what's it so it doesn't

325
00:31:29.96 --> 00:31:34.44
feel good to spend on dental but it would have felt good to buy a new plasma screen TV that you

326
00:31:34.44 --> 00:31:39.72
can watch the UFC and think about it when that plasma TV comes in you're like oh my gosh you

327
00:31:39.72 --> 00:31:43.96
can't wait to hook this up this thing is awesome I'll even put it on my credit card and pay for that

328
00:31:43.96 --> 00:31:49.72
thing over the next 12 months 50% interest on this thing I'll do that no problem because of that

329
00:31:49.72 --> 00:31:55.24
pleasure of getting it but oh dental you mean this toothache will go away this toothache that's

330
00:31:55.24 --> 00:32:01.40
causing me a migraine will go away and then I got you know then when it's time to pay that bill

331
00:32:02.44 --> 00:32:06.52
it's hard man you don't really want it it's weird Chad is backwards so

332
00:32:07.24 --> 00:32:12.60
all right well like I said come up with a plan come up with an extra out of G with contingencies and then

333
00:32:13.40 --> 00:32:20.20
save you money and execute get some check next question how do you suggest setting SOPs

334
00:32:20.20 --> 00:32:26.44
standard operating procedures we're none currently exist yeah good question and this is uh

335
00:32:28.20 --> 00:32:32.84
not gonna spend a ton of time on this well the best way to to develop SOPs is to let them be

336
00:32:32.84 --> 00:32:38.68
developed organically sort of from the people that are actually doing that task whatever it is

337
00:32:39.48 --> 00:32:45.88
and you kind of you you just turn what's actually happening into an SOP and then if there's

338
00:32:45.88 --> 00:32:51.32
multiple methods happening for something you kind of consolidate the methods into the best way

339
00:32:52.60 --> 00:32:57.48
and then test them and then you'll have your SOP there one thing that you shouldn't do with an SOP

340
00:32:57.96 --> 00:33:01.80
is come up with an a standard operating procedure inside of a vacuum and then push it down on the

341
00:33:01.80 --> 00:33:07.64
folks below you in the chain of command because they're gonna be they're gonna reject it um they are going to

342
00:33:07.64 --> 00:33:14.68
to they are going to know a better way of doing it because you made it up in a vacuum so so don't

343
00:33:14.68 --> 00:33:20.84
do that now there are sometimes where let's say you're gonna do something brand new that's never been

344
00:33:20.84 --> 00:33:29.32
done before and you have to kind of create an SOP then if you have to do that you you need to kind of

345
00:33:29.32 --> 00:33:33.64
explain to the team hey listen guys we've never done this type of mission before we've never done

346
00:33:33.64 --> 00:33:38.60
this type of project before here's my best guess at what a standard operating procedure is going to look like

347
00:33:39.32 --> 00:33:44.76
we're gonna try and execute this but believe me it's not perfect I'm open to feedback and I

348
00:33:44.76 --> 00:33:49.64
realize that it's gonna change but I want at least have a line for us to deviate from and actually

349
00:33:49.64 --> 00:33:57.08
this is an extreme ownership I talked about how we started organizing the SSE the sensitive

350
00:33:57.08 --> 00:34:02.52
slight sensitive site exploitation it's how we searched buildings and it's in the book but when

351
00:34:02.52 --> 00:34:05.88
first started searching buildings we'd ever just go in and ransack everything and just throw everything

352
00:34:05.88 --> 00:34:10.68
around and it was totally ridiculous and ineffective and eventually you know I said okay we need

353
00:34:10.68 --> 00:34:14.04
to standard operating procedure in my system. Two commander said hey come up with a standard operating

354
00:34:14.04 --> 00:34:19.24
procedure of how we're gonna do this he did that and when he did of course and it's in the book

355
00:34:19.24 --> 00:34:23.64
people like oh this is gonna take forever and I was like okay listen we're gonna try it if there's

356
00:34:23.64 --> 00:34:27.48
some adjustments we got to make will make them but let's at least give it a try it and that's what we did

357
00:34:27.48 --> 00:34:34.44
and one of the best things you can do if you have to come up with an SOP is not only let it come

358
00:34:34.44 --> 00:34:40.28
organically from the task itself but let the people that are actually doing the task come up with

359
00:34:40.28 --> 00:34:45.64
the standard operating procedure so if you had if you had some project that you did over and over again

360
00:34:45.64 --> 00:34:50.20
I wouldn't come and say hey here's how I want you to do this project from now on Echo I'd say hey Echo

361
00:34:50.20 --> 00:34:54.44
since you're doing this all the time can you capture what it is you do and and we can take those

362
00:34:54.44 --> 00:34:58.36
best practices turn them into a standard operating procedure and get them through the whole

363
00:34:58.36 --> 00:35:04.28
organization and you'd say oh that's cool you would kind of feel some ownership of that and then you would

364
00:35:04.28 --> 00:35:10.44
put together a good plan so that's pretty straightforward with standard operating procedures the the

365
00:35:10.44 --> 00:35:15.88
main thing is let them develop let the team develop them keep an open mind don't force them

366
00:35:15.88 --> 00:35:28.76
down people's throat next question I'm a 17 year old I'm a blue belt in Giu Jitsu which I received a few

367
00:35:28.76 --> 00:35:34.76
days after my 16th birthday and I have ambitions of pursuing Giu Jitsu professionally and competing

368
00:35:34.76 --> 00:35:41.24
to the highest level possible of course this requires discipline and commitment so during the school term

369
00:35:41.24 --> 00:35:47.80
I trained Giu Jitsu Monday through Saturday and I wait train on Friday and Sunday and when I have

370
00:35:47.80 --> 00:35:52.76
time off school I trained Giu Jitsu three times a day however due to my commitment to this and my

371
00:35:52.76 --> 00:35:59.08
refusal to prioritize the other things over this I feel I'm missing out on the social opportunities of

372
00:35:59.08 --> 00:36:05.16
this part of my life I miss parties and social events in order to train Giu Jitsu and wait train

373
00:36:05.16 --> 00:36:11.64
because I know that I should have the discipline to do so however I feel lonely and isolated because of it

374
00:36:12.92 --> 00:36:19.16
is this just weakness or should I make the occasional exception for a social event once again love

375
00:36:19.16 --> 00:36:23.88
the work you do you and I go do it's an how it's helped me immensely thanks from you okay all right

376
00:36:23.88 --> 00:36:29.24
that you okay first of all it's just okay the hardcore here's the couple hardcore answers

377
00:36:29.24 --> 00:36:36.84
hardcore and it's no what's your schedule like right are you wasting any time have you have you

378
00:36:36.84 --> 00:36:43.64
maxed and maximize the hours you can get out of a day or are you spending time doing other things

379
00:36:43.64 --> 00:36:47.16
that you shouldn't be doing that being said it sounds like you're getting after it pretty hard

380
00:36:47.16 --> 00:36:54.60
which means you're probably pretty efficient and if you're if you're not wasting a bunch of time

381
00:36:54.60 --> 00:37:02.44
and you're not doing a bunch of things that are non productive and you're feeling lonely and

382
00:37:02.44 --> 00:37:07.96
isolated then guess what you're going to for you don't you should not be feeling lonely and isolated

383
00:37:07.96 --> 00:37:13.88
that's not good you need to relax especially because if you're training that much you're likely

384
00:37:13.88 --> 00:37:21.80
over training so broadly speaking now broadly speaking training should be enjoyable okay this is

385
00:37:21.80 --> 00:37:24.36
me that you're going to love it every day and I talk about that all the time this means every

386
00:37:24.36 --> 00:37:28.60
day you wake up and you're all you know smile from one ear to the other you're so happy you got to

387
00:37:28.60 --> 00:37:34.04
go do you know squats and deadlifts like no that doesn't happen but broadly the way it

388
00:37:34.04 --> 00:37:39.08
makes you feel the way you get you makes you feel should make you yeah other times when you go on

389
00:37:39.08 --> 00:37:47.24
the just too mad and you get spanked and you get ground out and you get tapped out and you feel like

390
00:37:47.24 --> 00:37:52.60
junk yes that's going to happen but again broadly how does Jesus who make you feel makes you feel good

391
00:37:52.60 --> 00:37:58.68
you should enjoy it to some extent right and you should not be getting burnt out and I think that's

392
00:37:58.68 --> 00:38:06.36
the most important thing is that you shouldn't be getting burnt out on jiu-jitsu on working out

393
00:38:06.36 --> 00:38:15.32
and this is this is important especially for your 17 years old there is more to life than

394
00:38:15.32 --> 00:38:24.52
jiu-jitsu in physical fitness right there's more to there's more to there's more to doing well

395
00:38:24.52 --> 00:38:34.84
in life than just jiu-jitsu in physical fitness so a couple things if you can't if you can't

396
00:38:34.84 --> 00:38:40.12
like communicate with people effectively that's a real problem in any environment right and if you're

397
00:38:40.12 --> 00:38:47.16
isolating yourself from other people and you're not you're not learning how to interact with other

398
00:38:47.16 --> 00:38:51.96
human beings in a social environment that's not good and it's not only it's not only that it's

399
00:38:52.84 --> 00:38:57.08
it's not only that it's just not good for you because yes you as a person you need to be well

400
00:38:57.08 --> 00:39:01.48
rounded you need to yes you need to be strong you need to be capable from a fighting perspective

401
00:39:01.48 --> 00:39:05.16
but you also need to be smart you need to be articulate you need to be quick with it

402
00:39:05.16 --> 00:39:12.44
and those things are mandatory skills in life I mean if you're a black belt in jiu-jitsu

403
00:39:13.32 --> 00:39:16.84
and you're a white belt in communicating with other human beings that's not going to be a good

404
00:39:16.84 --> 00:39:24.44
situation for you and the other thing is the better you are the more well rounded you are in all these

405
00:39:24.44 --> 00:39:27.64
other aspects of life those things will actually make you better at jiu-jitsu because you'll be

406
00:39:27.64 --> 00:39:31.32
able to read people you'll be able to deal with confrontation you'll be able to understand other

407
00:39:31.32 --> 00:39:39.48
people's motivations and all those things come from interacting with other human beings so I get it

408
00:39:40.12 --> 00:39:46.36
I get the massive commitment and that is what it takes like if you want to compete at the highest level

409
00:39:46.92 --> 00:39:53.32
I'm telling you yes you have to live breathe and eat jiu-jitsu you have to live breathe and eat conditioning

410
00:39:53.32 --> 00:40:02.28
and that being said if that's all you live breathe and eat that's going to make you less

411
00:40:03.80 --> 00:40:10.52
apt to be a champion then if you make yourself a little bit more well rounded in some of these other

412
00:40:10.52 --> 00:40:19.64
aspects so do keep training hard 17 year old blue belt from UK keep training hard

413
00:40:19.64 --> 00:40:30.44
go out occasionally hang out with some people have a good time and that by no means means get hammered

414
00:40:30.44 --> 00:40:35.72
every time you do it all not at all yeah yeah yeah that's social aspect man that's like

415
00:40:35.72 --> 00:40:40.68
that's it seems like a lot of times especially when you're training or you're doing something that's

416
00:40:40.68 --> 00:40:44.44
kind of directly or can be viewed as like directly opposite of a social thing because you don't

417
00:40:44.44 --> 00:40:49.72
when you think socially you're thinking all you guys are just slack and hanging out going to the bar cruising at the beach

418
00:40:50.36 --> 00:40:56.12
whatever well while we're over here training kind of thing right just like just like people say oh you're

419
00:40:56.12 --> 00:41:01.48
sleeping on the couch you know what are you lazy sleeping on the couch well I don't know maybe they need rest you know

420
00:41:01.48 --> 00:41:07.88
or make there's there's there's use in sleep seems like that was a that was a little

421
00:41:07.88 --> 00:41:11.96
maybe kind of a glimpse into the echo Charles world right there maybe maybe not

422
00:41:11.96 --> 00:41:16.44
not live sleep on the couch maybe I need rest maybe I'm recovering from the work I just did

423
00:41:16.44 --> 00:41:21.32
you seem saying I'm saying there's two parts of it you know there's that and so

424
00:41:22.04 --> 00:41:26.36
and people give it a bad rap I think especially like you know how like you know you hear these

425
00:41:27.08 --> 00:41:33.24
motivational gurus grind all sleep when I'm dead you know that kind of thing right yeah I say that

426
00:41:33.24 --> 00:41:40.52
so yeah I you said it not me but hey all right so and I'm not saying that you know that's

427
00:41:40.52 --> 00:41:46.04
dumb or nothing like that I'm saying that I'm saying that it produces a certain message that

428
00:41:46.04 --> 00:41:52.20
can be interpreted in a way that might not be the most beneficial well I'm sure I think this

429
00:41:52.20 --> 00:41:57.32
just I'm glad that he asked this question because he's taking the attitude of like okay

430
00:41:57.32 --> 00:42:02.28
I'm gonna sleep on that and I'm gonna hang out with other human beings after my world champion

431
00:42:02.28 --> 00:42:09.64
and again do you need to be possessed to be a world champion yes you do but all I'm saying is

432
00:42:10.52 --> 00:42:15.000
part of the things that will make you be a better well-rounded person the more well-rounded you are

433
00:42:16.04 --> 00:42:20.36
the better you're gonna perform you know you're gonna learn how to deal with anxiety you're gonna learn how to

434
00:42:20.36 --> 00:42:24.44
deal with people you're gonna learn how to look at someone else's situate looking their eyes and be like

435
00:42:24.44 --> 00:42:28.12
okay this guy's stressed out or this guy's panicking or this guy you know you learn those things

436
00:42:28.12 --> 00:42:31.56
from interacting with the people that's gonna make you a better competitor you're gonna learn

437
00:42:31.56 --> 00:42:35.96
more about yourself that's gonna make you a better competitor and you're gonna be if you if you

438
00:42:35.96 --> 00:42:40.36
relax now what you don't want to do is go so far in the other direction where you when you show up

439
00:42:40.92 --> 00:42:44.84
to a competition you don't feel like you've prepared as much as you could but

440
00:42:45.88 --> 00:42:48.76
that what does that do you go to far in the other direction now you over-trained

441
00:42:49.80 --> 00:42:53.32
so you gotta find a little bit of but sounds like you're a little bit off balance especially

442
00:42:53.32 --> 00:42:57.88
because you're feeling like the words that kind of keyed me off the most in this was what was

443
00:42:57.88 --> 00:43:03.80
it lonely and isolated that that's what kind of if you said everything else here and then you

444
00:43:03.80 --> 00:43:10.04
are like um am I over-training? I would have said no man you're getting after a good job but then

445
00:43:10.04 --> 00:43:15.24
when you say look I feel lonely and isolated you don't want to feel lonely and isolated like

446
00:43:15.24 --> 00:43:18.92
and that's another thing when I change jitsu that's kind of where I hang out like I don't

447
00:43:18.92 --> 00:43:24.20
interact with the normal it's a social thing we might not even talk we might not even say one word

448
00:43:24.20 --> 00:43:30.20
other than do you want to roll and then we train that's sort of my social activity of

449
00:43:30.20 --> 00:43:33.80
hanging around with other people and I don't feel I leave the gym and I feel like I hung around

450
00:43:33.80 --> 00:43:40.04
with a lot of people I didn't say anything to them but if you feel lonely and isolated that's not

451
00:43:40.04 --> 00:43:45.64
good that's getting to you that means your mind is starting to be worn down from this don't let it

452
00:43:45.64 --> 00:43:52.04
get worn down it's gonna refuel you to go out it's gonna I watch this watch this if you're feeling

453
00:43:52.04 --> 00:43:59.64
only isolated you're workout that day is like a nine if you feel like like hey I'm having a good

454
00:43:59.64 --> 00:44:04.20
life I'm I'm filled with energy I like hanging out I just you know how to good time with this girl

455
00:44:04.20 --> 00:44:09.96
last night and now I'm going to train it's like oh okay guess what that's workouts 9.7 you get a

456
00:44:09.96 --> 00:44:16.44
better training because you had a good time yeah so yeah I don't like the fact that he says he's

457
00:44:16.44 --> 00:44:24.68
lonely and isolated that's not good and again this is just a dichotomy because then you get someone

458
00:44:24.68 --> 00:44:28.92
that says okay well jocals are go out and you don't have party you know party party party with the ladies

459
00:44:29.96 --> 00:44:33.64
and then and then help my workout yeah I'll help my workout and then well you know

460
00:44:34.28 --> 00:44:40.20
maybe if I only workout three times a week and I spend most of my time partying I'll be just

461
00:44:40.20 --> 00:44:48.68
I'll get workouts level 11 no you won't so yeah man make some exceptions to your discipline

462
00:44:48.68 --> 00:44:53.64
and go enjoy the company of some other people grow a little bit as a person become a better human

463
00:44:53.64 --> 00:45:01.16
compete better train harder that's it agree so the man this is a concept that I think is if you

464
00:45:01.16 --> 00:45:06.52
can kind of incorporate or understand this concept in you know when you're working hard at something

465
00:45:06.52 --> 00:45:12.84
so when I was young when I first started lifting weights first started I don't know 15 or whatever

466
00:45:12.84 --> 00:45:18.36
well done so you know you know how when you live weights and you get that little pump right

467
00:45:18.36 --> 00:45:24.04
to me to me I thought that that's literally my muscles growing you know like I didn't know how

468
00:45:24.04 --> 00:45:29.56
it all worked I was like dang my muscles I can see the growth already so all I got to do is

469
00:45:29.56 --> 00:45:34.28
lift every single day watch out quick you know because most people they won't work as hard as me

470
00:45:34.28 --> 00:45:41.48
because all just because I like doing it I like to pump whatever so I would do we remember

471
00:45:41.48 --> 00:45:48.60
the guy my friend I mentioned Eric Masters pilot in the air force yes so he he at the one

472
00:45:48.60 --> 00:45:54.44
he always said the soda above my boy anyway so I'd lift with him and his dad would invite me

473
00:45:54.44 --> 00:45:58.76
my brother over we'll we'll lift we'll any start off with Bench and you know this stuff so

474
00:45:58.76 --> 00:46:06.12
we go lift and I'm like dang I feel like pump so now when I when we trend kind of went into

475
00:46:06.12 --> 00:46:10.68
I want to say like far city football I don't know anyway we started lifting in the weight room at

476
00:46:10.68 --> 00:46:14.60
the high school so I would do the same thing every single day every single day every single day

477
00:46:14.60 --> 00:46:20.28
and my friend was like this other guy you know he goes hey you are you Bench in every single day

478
00:46:20.28 --> 00:46:24.76
you know it was like yeah and he was like bro your muscles aren't going to grow that's like what

479
00:46:24.76 --> 00:46:28.52
are you talking about of course they do they grow every single day like I feel it even he's like bro you

480
00:46:28.52 --> 00:46:33.72
don't know how it works he's like you don't when you lift they don't grow they actually get torn

481
00:46:33.72 --> 00:46:39.32
they get like almost like a little micro injury that's how it works and then when you rest and when

482
00:46:39.32 --> 00:46:45.88
you sleep and when you eat and they grow and it did it still didn't make sense well it's like okay I

483
00:46:45.88 --> 00:46:49.72
guess you know he's like you ever you know when the the sorness you know when you get the sorness or

484
00:46:49.72 --> 00:46:53.48
whatever it was like yeah he's like that's like it like hurt like kind of injured whatever and then

485
00:46:53.48 --> 00:46:58.04
it has to heal up and when it heals up it heals up bigger and I'm like okay so you can't ban

486
00:46:58.04 --> 00:47:02.12
to every day otherwise it'll just like it'll just won't grow it always be damaged I was like

487
00:47:02.12 --> 00:47:08.12
all makes sense so that rest in between workouts it's kind of important given my goal

488
00:47:09.88 --> 00:47:15.16
grow so muscles you see I'm saying where this kind of thing works like all go all go no rest

489
00:47:15.72 --> 00:47:21.96
but you need that rest to grow literally and that goes for anything truth and this is kind of

490
00:47:21.96 --> 00:47:28.28
the next question is very closely related to this that's why I put it kind of like right next to it

491
00:47:28.60 --> 00:47:34.76
yeah and that is jockel I should have asked it muster 0's or 6 is there a dichotomy

492
00:47:34.76 --> 00:47:41.80
dichotomy in the unmitigated, unmitigated daily discipline in all things yeah and like I said this is

493
00:47:41.80 --> 00:47:45.96
why I put this question here because it's related to the question the answer that I just gave

494
00:47:45.96 --> 00:47:53.000
which is yes you can you can overdo it and there is a dichotomy you can put so much focus on working

495
00:47:56.12 --> 00:48:00.28
you can put so much working so much focus on working that you lose track of your family

496
00:48:01.40 --> 00:48:04.92
and everything goes down tell with your family or you can do the opposite put so much focus on your

497
00:48:04.92 --> 00:48:11.000
family that you lose track of that you don't do what you're supposed to do at work so you need to

498
00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:18.92
back off a little and you get people that waste time on things that don't matter this goes back

499
00:48:18.92 --> 00:48:24.12
remember the podcast we did where I was talking about how like a black belt when a white belt

500
00:48:24.12 --> 00:48:29.32
is grabbing a black belt sleeve and it just doesn't matter there's people that think that

501
00:48:29.32 --> 00:48:35.32
it's important that I do this thing this certain way and the reality is it's useless it doesn't

502
00:48:35.32 --> 00:48:41.80
matter you're being OCD right you're being OCD so or you maybe not being full OCD but you're being

503
00:48:41.80 --> 00:48:45.48
borderline you got to think about what's important and what's not important and if you're

504
00:48:45.48 --> 00:48:54.28
discipline if you generally or oftentimes people that are hyper disciplined about little things

505
00:48:55.08 --> 00:49:00.12
a lot of times they're missing their discipline and other areas of their life and one of them

506
00:49:00.12 --> 00:49:04.68
and and you we've talked about this before too which is somebody that just because someone is

507
00:49:04.68 --> 00:49:08.84
hyper disciplined in their physical fitness doesn't mean that they're disciplined in their

508
00:49:08.84 --> 00:49:13.56
rest of their life in many other ways whether it's financial whether it's their relationships

509
00:49:13.56 --> 00:49:20.44
whatever like everything they can be screwing every they're super disciplined in weighing their food

510
00:49:20.44 --> 00:49:27.40
and doing macro calorie counting and all that stuff right and yet they haven't paid their phone bill

511
00:49:27.40 --> 00:49:32.84
or whatever and they've got financial issues or they've got health like other health issues

512
00:49:32.84 --> 00:49:39.72
and so you need that you need to back off enough on the little things that don't matter

513
00:49:40.36 --> 00:49:45.24
that so that the things that matter you can actually take care of now the weird dichotomy in this

514
00:49:45.24 --> 00:49:50.92
is again it always comes up the Russian soldiers in the Cheshiren war not shaving

515
00:49:51.88 --> 00:49:58.20
is it really important that they shave not really but what's really important is that they

516
00:49:58.20 --> 00:50:04.44
have discipline overall and when they stop shaving they let go of their discipline and that was the

517
00:50:04.44 --> 00:50:11.48
problem now so there's about that's what I'm saying there's a balance and I guess let me let me

518
00:50:11.48 --> 00:50:18.76
make that a little more clearly if we were in a war and what I was focused on was echo you better

519
00:50:18.76 --> 00:50:24.28
shave tomorrow that was my big focus echo your uniform better be squared away tomorrow like that

520
00:50:24.28 --> 00:50:29.48
that is not what the most important the most important thing is like echo do you understand

521
00:50:29.48 --> 00:50:33.64
where the fallback positions are echo do you understand what your field of fire is echo do you

522
00:50:33.64 --> 00:50:36.84
know what you're supposed to do when we start getting over run those are what's important

523
00:50:36.84 --> 00:50:44.28
and but if I focus on this little thing that doesn't really matter that can that can be a problem

524
00:50:44.28 --> 00:50:49.32
so I need to make sure that I'm focused on the correct things and in life yes you can unmitigate a

525
00:50:49.32 --> 00:50:54.28
daily discipline if you try to apply it to absolutely everything in your life just like prioritize next

526
00:50:54.28 --> 00:50:57.16
year if you try to solve all your problems at the same time you won't be able to solve any

527
00:50:57.16 --> 00:51:03.56
if you try to implement perfect discipline in every single thing that you do you won't be able to

528
00:51:04.68 --> 00:51:14.12
apply discipline to the things that are most important my garage gym floor is dirty

529
00:51:14.12 --> 00:51:23.56
okay I sweep it I sweep it every third day I just sweep it out but I don't get in there with a bucket

530
00:51:23.56 --> 00:51:30.84
and a mop and trying clean the chalk off so it's perfect black why because it doesn't matter

531
00:51:31.56 --> 00:51:37.24
so some things in life are like your gym floor it just it doesn't matter if there's chalk on it

532
00:51:37.24 --> 00:51:41.40
I'm gonna put more chalk on it later the chalk doesn't make me slip it doesn't make me sick

533
00:51:41.40 --> 00:51:46.28
it doesn't it doesn't I don't care how it looks so don't worry about the chalk on the gym floor

534
00:51:46.84 --> 00:51:50.68
in fact there's gyms in the world where you're not allowed to have chalk because they don't want

535
00:51:50.68 --> 00:51:56.84
chalk on the gym floor those places shouldn't exist in the world they should be they should be

536
00:51:57.24 --> 00:52:03.000
illegal yes there should be chalk everywhere yeah gym available yeah you're right so don't

537
00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:07.000
focus on things that don't matter there you go you know it seems like the whole discipline

538
00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:11.80
equals freedom thing and whether you agree with it or not actually you know I think you will agree with this

539
00:52:11.80 --> 00:52:17.24
it's a dance you know it's a dance with discipline and freedom you mean about about about

540
00:52:17.24 --> 00:52:23.24
the economy yes it's in fact a lot of book about it yeah thank you so it's gonna be

541
00:52:23.24 --> 00:52:29.40
to take ownership it's just it just depends on who you are like you the discipline is going to

542
00:52:29.40 --> 00:52:35.56
be taking the lead big time you know and when you exercise your freedom with I don't know I don't

543
00:52:35.56 --> 00:52:40.52
know I mean chalk ice cream or something like this when you exercise that freedom it's not

544
00:52:40.52 --> 00:52:44.60
gonna be very often but when you do boom yeah it's gonna have benefit yeah and that's when you

545
00:52:44.60 --> 00:52:48.60
see somebody that's let's just talk about this well when you see somebody that's out of shape

546
00:52:49.64 --> 00:52:54.04
you could say you could say one or two things you could say not enough discipline or you could say

547
00:52:54.04 --> 00:52:58.44
too much freedom we know it's one of those two things yes have you see someone that's

548
00:52:58.44 --> 00:53:03.32
having financial issues yeah it's one or two things not enough discipline or too much freedom they're

549
00:53:03.32 --> 00:53:07.80
getting out that credit card when they're doing right yeah so yeah they goes without saying

550
00:53:07.80 --> 00:53:14.44
that it's a balance it's the economy that's correct yeah so even and also on top of that the

551
00:53:14.44 --> 00:53:18.20
discipline and all things because that's a question right in all maybe you could

552
00:53:18.20 --> 00:53:21.64
maybe you could write a book called the dance of leadership

553
00:53:24.04 --> 00:53:31.000
it's a copy that I got me but the in all things like discipline in diet discipline in

554
00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:37.32
um you know workouts and not slack in and whatever and that looks way different than discipline

555
00:53:37.32 --> 00:53:42.44
in like relationships for example like if you're like a different like to you know the discipline

556
00:53:42.44 --> 00:53:48.44
not to lose your temper or they're just a plan to to respond to a maybe not discipline person

557
00:53:48.44 --> 00:53:52.04
or something let's say someone you love who's who's maybe emotionally different than you

558
00:53:52.04 --> 00:53:57.32
or whatever that looks and feels way different you know if you if you really think about it so

559
00:53:57.32 --> 00:54:06.04
if you're like hey I'm not gonna I don't know I'm not gonna go to the park with my wife because I'm

560
00:54:06.04 --> 00:54:10.84
working now that's my discipline yeah so you're lacking the discipline to

561
00:54:11.64 --> 00:54:17.24
organize around your relationship with your relationship or you're lacking the discipline to

562
00:54:17.24 --> 00:54:21.64
make sure that your wife understands that you're going to train yeah because I'm going to train

563
00:54:21.64 --> 00:54:27.24
but as far as we're like and now that's back on the training and but like with like your relationships

564
00:54:27.24 --> 00:54:32.36
unless your relationships aren't important to you which is I mean I would argue most times

565
00:54:32.92 --> 00:54:38.52
there's some relationships in your life that that are gonna be important I would argue that

566
00:54:38.52 --> 00:54:43.24
well yeah there should be I think so too yes so that's where you're up to before

567
00:54:43.24 --> 00:54:48.52
maintaining discipline in those relationships looks different so it might not be as obvious

568
00:54:48.52 --> 00:54:53.80
someone someone says me unmit it when you say unmit it get a discipline and all things I don't

569
00:54:53.80 --> 00:54:58.76
think automatically right off the top of my head like oh you know my relationship with my wife

570
00:54:58.76 --> 00:55:02.84
you know or even the relationship with your kids like when I think unmit it get a daily discipline

571
00:55:02.84 --> 00:55:07.24
in all things including my kids so I'm gonna I'm gonna make sure they're discipline all but

572
00:55:07.24 --> 00:55:12.04
the discipline of your of yourself dealing with the kids that's a whole different thing

573
00:55:12.04 --> 00:55:17.80
soon saying true so you gotta get a keep those in mind oh I found myself yeah I find when I

574
00:55:17.80 --> 00:55:22.20
I keep that in mind it it'll help and then yeah and do the dance with freedom you

575
00:55:22.20 --> 00:55:27.96
designate how much freedom you are gonna exercise and then you do the dance

576
00:55:27.96 --> 00:55:31.40
soon saying you balance the dichotomy is what you do yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

577
00:55:31.40 --> 00:55:39.24
bro right you dance right it's a it and he's gone man here's the wrong thing what I made

578
00:55:39.24 --> 00:55:45.40
a mistake of at one point long time ago I looked at you and I was like should I need to do that

579
00:55:45.96 --> 00:55:52.12
I need to wake up I need to like do all this stuff water but if I were to do that I'd jump myself up

580
00:55:53.64 --> 00:55:58.84
so I can't like you can't use like the next person as the standard as far as the balance goes

581
00:55:58.84 --> 00:56:03.96
like you have to designate your own balance yeah because you have to modulate for your life

582
00:56:03.96 --> 00:56:08.36
yeah whatever bro people don't just automatically know that I know I didn't

583
00:56:08.36 --> 00:56:13.72
check figure it out and see you get up at 430 at any point though yeah I tried you know that

584
00:56:15.72 --> 00:56:22.60
check anyway next question is there one form or type of jiu jitsu that is better

585
00:56:23.24 --> 00:56:31.24
than other forms not Japanese versus small circle jiu jitsu but pressure versus movement

586
00:56:31.24 --> 00:56:37.24
bottom versus top different types of quote unquote games got it yeah so if you don't know

587
00:56:37.24 --> 00:56:41.56
there's different types of jiu jitsu in the world there's things like he mentioned here

588
00:56:41.56 --> 00:56:45.32
there's Japanese jiu jitsu and there's something called small circle jiu jitsu and then there's

589
00:56:45.32 --> 00:56:52.92
just a million different kind of random sort of names that people will put on jiu jitsu right

590
00:56:53.56 --> 00:57:01.16
the one that we do is generally referred to as Brazilian jiu jitsu I just generally referred to

591
00:57:01.16 --> 00:57:07.64
as jiu jitsu because that's what I'm talking about so there are different types of all the

592
00:57:07.64 --> 00:57:12.52
different types of jiu jitsu the one that you should be doing is Brazilian jiu jitsu the other types

593
00:57:14.52 --> 00:57:21.32
are not what you want to be doing yeah generally and yeah so that's just the

594
00:57:21.32 --> 00:57:28.52
necessary out of it so now but then he's asking a different question which is inside of inside of

595
00:57:28.52 --> 00:57:35.80
even Brazilian jiu jitsu there's different types of styles that people will have and these are

596
00:57:36.68 --> 00:57:41.88
people go end up calling them games like what kind of game does this person have what kind of

597
00:57:41.88 --> 00:57:47.56
game does that person have and different people have different games and it depends on their body

598
00:57:47.56 --> 00:57:52.20
the different body types have different styles different games different even different like

599
00:57:52.20 --> 00:57:57.80
cardio levels can have different games different styles different flexibility levels different

600
00:57:57.80 --> 00:58:05.24
games different styles even different personalities if you have different personalities you'll end up with

601
00:58:05.24 --> 00:58:14.52
a different style so the question is are there some games or some styles that are better than

602
00:58:14.52 --> 00:58:22.52
other games or other styles inside of jiu jitsu and my answer to that I think is no there's not

603
00:58:22.52 --> 00:58:28.60
games that are better than other games not styles of jiu jitsu that are better than other styles

604
00:58:28.60 --> 00:58:34.60
of jiu jitsu it's just different people gravitate towards different ones and they use them successfully

605
00:58:36.04 --> 00:58:43.24
and that's why they continue to use them I would say this though if you can then develop

606
00:58:44.60 --> 00:58:52.20
more than one game right more than one game like if all you know how to do is pressure pass

607
00:58:52.20 --> 00:58:55.08
that's the only kind of pass you know and you come up against someone that's really good

608
00:58:55.08 --> 00:59:01.64
of getting a defending the pressure pass you won't be able to pass the guard if you're if you

609
00:59:01.64 --> 00:59:05.72
have a really good top game but you go against the wrestler that's a better wrestler than you

610
00:59:05.72 --> 00:59:12.20
put you on your back then that's going to be a problem so you're going to have to think people

611
00:59:12.20 --> 00:59:16.12
ask is how do I develop my style the answer is you just train and your style is going to come

612
00:59:16.12 --> 00:59:19.88
you you don't know that case is someone might tell you like hey you're long and lanky you should

613
00:59:19.88 --> 00:59:24.44
use triangle you should set up good triangle games or good darshtokes or someone says hey you're

614
00:59:24.44 --> 00:59:28.84
you got good base you should you know use a lot of pressure so there can be someone giving you some

615
00:59:28.84 --> 00:59:34.68
indication but you're going to self select as you train what works and as you continue to do

616
00:59:34.68 --> 00:59:39.88
what works for you you'll get better and better at it yeah that's funny you think it makes

617
00:59:39.88 --> 00:59:45.40
sense like just train and it'll sort of sort itself you know your game your style like and

618
00:59:45.40 --> 00:59:50.68
there the reason um it might seem kind of but the reason why I like these tall lanky guys

619
00:59:50.68 --> 00:59:55.24
they'll do like triangles and stuff because when they first start training though the triangle

620
00:59:55.24 --> 00:59:59.88
is going to come way easier than a guy who's not as lanky you know early on so they're

621
00:59:59.88 --> 01:00:03.96
like oh shoot that's successful so it's kind of like check that that's good so they're again

622
01:00:03.96 --> 01:00:10.04
boom that becomes part of their game super early so that kind of is a dominant part of their whole

623
01:00:10.04 --> 01:00:15.40
game and then you know the more the more they train the more things are going to start falling into

624
01:00:15.40 --> 01:00:19.80
place in their game you know and so if you have a lanky all those lanky moves are going to register

625
01:00:19.80 --> 01:00:24.60
way quicker than you know a shorter guy or stock your guy that's yeah it's funny how you put

626
01:00:24.60 --> 01:00:29.88
that just train it'll sort of just they reveal themselves they reveal that's all yeah they totally do

627
01:00:30.28 --> 01:00:35.72
check yeah this this question also ties into the next question so I kind of coupled it up with

628
01:00:35.72 --> 01:00:41.96
the next question as well did you do you feel well you know your answer to the is there a better

629
01:00:41.96 --> 01:00:46.12
game or whatever I feel like you know like when you watch ADCC or something like this and then you

630
01:00:46.12 --> 01:00:51.80
just have a guy like Hodger who's six four you know and then you have Marcelo Garcia you guys

631
01:00:51.80 --> 01:00:57.08
who are arguably like just is good the best guy is ever to do it and they're just completely

632
01:00:57.08 --> 01:01:01.72
out of your body body so yeah body types man it's kind of like when I watch those kind of like

633
01:01:01.72 --> 01:01:06.36
um like you ever heard of the game mortal combat I have heard of it yeah so it's like this it's

634
01:01:06.36 --> 01:01:09.56
this real violent game I was too dumb because it's like they have weapons and stuff that they

635
01:01:09.56 --> 01:01:14.84
can sort of bust out random like this guy named Scorpion his weapon it's a spear with a rope

636
01:01:14.84 --> 01:01:19.56
or chain or whatever and he pulls you and he does this thing and the guy who can freeze people you know

637
01:01:19.56 --> 01:01:23.80
and the guy who can uh I don't know throw his hat and just cut people I don't know you know so

638
01:01:23.80 --> 01:01:28.04
people have all these different weapons but then you would think hey if a guy can freeze a person

639
01:01:28.04 --> 01:01:33.16
wouldn't he be the best guy you just freeze people it's all you gotta do you know but doesn't

640
01:01:33.16 --> 01:01:37.56
work itself out it's whoever's good at using the little ice ray or whatever it's called

641
01:01:37.56 --> 01:01:43.16
it's interesting who's better at using that spear with the rope okay we'll go with it man

642
01:01:43.16 --> 01:01:47.16
but that's that's the way it works and you just do two of them just change well anyways that

643
01:01:47.16 --> 01:01:53.08
question relates to the next question oh okay yes next question sure yes hi jocardo combat

644
01:01:53.08 --> 01:01:59.000
oh what's the story fighter let us do there street fighter too yes actually there's street fighter

645
01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:04.12
which really kind of went unnoticed I think by the general public then there's street fighter too

646
01:02:04.12 --> 01:02:10.44
that's when it sort of became like this big that was like the main combat game I think with

647
01:02:10.44 --> 01:02:14.68
fighting street fighter too what year was that I don't know I was in high school also I don't

648
01:02:14.68 --> 01:02:21.08
90's it was good I was doing jiu jitsu yeah and uh yeah man you missed out a little bit because

649
01:02:21.08 --> 01:02:25.24
there was a lot of common on anything best street fighter too with there's this guy named

650
01:02:25.24 --> 01:02:32.12
gile seems gile bro I'm telling you I'm telling you revisit that or in your case visit that

651
01:02:32.12 --> 01:02:38.28
gile he threw this thing called a sonic it's it's it's just look at it anyway next question jocko

652
01:02:38.28 --> 01:02:44.92
there's an army cliche that I'm sure you've heard of or you've heard that goes everyone's

653
01:02:44.92 --> 01:02:50.28
leadership style is different I've heard it used many times as a cover up for failed mission or

654
01:02:50.28 --> 01:02:54.68
with someone who just isn't getting it done what's your opinion on this for all the advice that

655
01:02:54.68 --> 01:02:59.80
you give there seems to be a continuous method to your madness and some basic principles for being a good

656
01:02:59.80 --> 01:03:06.04
leader does everyone have a different leadership style or is there an optimal optimal method

657
01:03:06.76 --> 01:03:13.88
with personality tweaks that's just amazing how well this jiu jitsu comparison to this is this is

658
01:03:13.88 --> 01:03:19.48
this is just an incredible translation and if you know the way bro bro you see them all things

659
01:03:19.48 --> 01:03:26.44
because what this question is is exactly the same as the question above and and the fact the matter is

660
01:03:26.44 --> 01:03:33.96
if you know jiu jitsu Brazilian jiu jitsu you know the fundamental principles of it

661
01:03:35.16 --> 01:03:39.80
you can do these tweaks if you don't know the fundamental principles of it you're just going to get destroyed

662
01:03:39.80 --> 01:03:47.000
now okay if you're a catch wrestler that those have the same sort of fundamental things going on

663
01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:50.84
you know what I mean if you know sombo so if you know jiu jitsu so I'm saying if you understand

664
01:03:50.84 --> 01:03:54.76
I don't want to call him but if you understand like the fundamental principles of submission

665
01:03:54.76 --> 01:04:01.96
grappling of any kind if you know what those are then you can make some tweaks to them you can make

666
01:04:01.96 --> 01:04:07.40
some some adjustments to them to bait based on your style and your body type and your personality

667
01:04:07.40 --> 01:04:16.04
and your strengths and weaknesses yes it is the same thing with leadership so people are going to have

668
01:04:16.04 --> 01:04:21.48
different styles they're going to have different styles of leadership some people are super

669
01:04:21.48 --> 01:04:25.96
care charismatic right and that person could take advantage of their their charisma some people

670
01:04:26.52 --> 01:04:31.96
like connect with other people really easily some people don't you're going to have just different

671
01:04:32.76 --> 01:04:38.04
little nuances to your personality and your brain that are going to

672
01:04:38.04 --> 01:04:44.52
you that you're going to make little adaptations in your leadership style that's okay where it gets

673
01:04:44.52 --> 01:04:52.28
not okay is if you leave the fundamental principles that's where you have a problem there's

674
01:04:52.28 --> 01:04:57.08
an example that I thought of when I read this question there was a guy that was coming through

675
01:04:57.08 --> 01:05:03.64
my training when I was running the the advanced training for the seals and he was making and

676
01:05:03.64 --> 01:05:08.68
actually Lafes told story you remember Lafes told the story I think it's in the book too I don't

677
01:05:08.68 --> 01:05:12.28
remember but it's it's podcast book we've talked about it in a bunch we talk about it when we

678
01:05:12.28 --> 01:05:18.28
to go talk to clients Lafes tells the story about how he was trying to give commands over the

679
01:05:18.28 --> 01:05:24.60
radio and no one's doing anything because it's ineffective to give commands in the radio

680
01:05:24.60 --> 01:05:27.64
in a when there's a lot of machine gun firing all the stuff going on so I said Lafes

681
01:05:28.28 --> 01:05:31.88
used verbal commands and he kind of like looked at me like I was crazy and I said him and just

682
01:05:31.88 --> 01:05:37.08
give it a try he did it it worked a couple years later I'm running training and there's a guy

683
01:05:37.08 --> 01:05:43.56
that's given a bunch of commands on the radio and I go to a my go hey man use verbal commands

684
01:05:43.56 --> 01:05:48.28
and he's like what do you mean and I'm like yell at everyone so they know what it is you

685
01:05:48.28 --> 01:05:54.36
want them to do they can't hear you on the radio there's a lot of stuff going on and he goes

686
01:05:54.36 --> 01:06:03.80
I don't lead that way that's what he said to me I don't lead that way and you know they just

687
01:06:03.80 --> 01:06:08.20
got destroyed because you know in his I don't know if he thought like hey look I'm not going to

688
01:06:08.20 --> 01:06:13.16
yeah I wasn't telling them to yell at his people I was telling them like yell the verbal commands

689
01:06:14.44 --> 01:06:22.36
and he wouldn't do it and they just got annihilated all the time and he ended up not doing well

690
01:06:22.36 --> 01:06:29.40
as a leader because he was breaking the fundamental principles of combat leadership like simple

691
01:06:29.40 --> 01:06:32.20
clear concise commands that everyone understands if they don't understand it it was fault the

692
01:06:32.20 --> 01:06:36.12
does it it's yours and if you're talking on the radio given these complex orders people aren't

693
01:06:36.12 --> 01:06:40.92
going to understand what to do but if you give them the the the standard operating procedure maneuver

694
01:06:40.92 --> 01:06:48.68
command peel right that's going to get past everyone's gonna do it so he straight away from

695
01:06:48.68 --> 01:06:54.60
the fundamental principles it's like it's like saying well you know with me if I give you

696
01:06:54.60 --> 01:06:59.64
if I use a pressure point on your neck then I'll win it's like no actually that's not going to be

697
01:06:59.64 --> 01:07:07.000
effective you the pressure point thing is a fantasy oh no it's real okay it is real you know what

698
01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:11.48
and there's a there's certain parts of your body that hurt a little bit more when you press into

699
01:07:11.48 --> 01:07:17.08
him I understand that that doesn't change you from getting choked doesn't change you from getting

700
01:07:17.08 --> 01:07:20.84
double egg takedown you try to hit some of the pressure point while they're doing a double egg

701
01:07:20.84 --> 01:07:30.44
takedown on you you're not gonna make it no it's not gonna happen so you you you have and I've

702
01:07:30.44 --> 01:07:35.000
told this story too about the guy that wasn't very loud and I told him like hey you got to

703
01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:38.84
get louder and eventually he got the guys that were loud in his platoon to start giving the verbal

704
01:07:38.84 --> 01:07:43.08
commands because he wasn't loud enough to do it and that was an effective way still using the same

705
01:07:43.08 --> 01:07:47.48
principle just using a little bit of a different technique that's fine so yes different leaders

706
01:07:47.48 --> 01:07:51.32
are gonna lead differently but the principles are gonna remain the same the the principles of

707
01:07:51.32 --> 01:07:57.16
ownership cover move simple prioritize next you decentralized command and balancing the dichotomies

708
01:07:57.16 --> 01:08:04.60
and then there's plenty of them in leadership the good leaders out there they will follow those

709
01:08:04.60 --> 01:08:09.48
principles and they'll make a little tweaks to them based on their personality and that's fine

710
01:08:09.48 --> 01:08:17.64
but a tweak doesn't require an excuse and also effective or ineffective like if you make a change

711
01:08:17.64 --> 01:08:21.80
if you do something a certain way and it's not effective then whatever you change this isn't working

712
01:08:21.80 --> 01:08:28.84
it's not working so use the fundamental principles make little apt to adaptations it's okay

713
01:08:28.84 --> 01:08:34.20
but if a leader is ineffective and they're failing guess what they're little adaptations like hey

714
01:08:34.20 --> 01:08:41.48
I could make up a new move right for jiu jitsu and I and I call it the the whiz bang sure

715
01:08:41.48 --> 01:08:46.44
and I say hey I made up this cool move it's called the whiz bang and let me show it to you and

716
01:08:46.44 --> 01:08:49.24
so I show it to you and you're like well I don't know if that'll work or not and I like no it'll

717
01:08:49.24 --> 01:08:53.88
definitely work the cool thing about jiu jitsu is when I try it we find out if it works

718
01:08:53.88 --> 01:08:58.60
now something doesn't work immediately right but let's say I keep drilling it on you and drilling it on

719
01:08:58.60 --> 01:09:05.04
you and I can never get you in the whiz bang and then I go in an internment and I try the whiz

720
01:09:05.04 --> 01:09:09.08
bang and I get smashed and defeated and then I go through the consolation bracket I try the

721
01:09:09.08 --> 01:09:13.88
whiz bang and it gets smashed and defeated then I go on the next tournament I try the whiz bang

722
01:09:13.88 --> 01:09:17.72
and it gets smashed and defeated then again the consolation bracket I try the whiz bang

723
01:09:17.72 --> 01:09:21.96
I get smashed and defeated and I do this for six months and the whiz bang never works

724
01:09:21.96 --> 01:09:23.72
never works.

725
01:09:23.72 --> 01:09:25.84
Effective or ineffective.

726
01:09:25.84 --> 01:09:26.88
Currently ineffective.

727
01:09:26.88 --> 01:09:28.28
It's ineffective.

728
01:09:28.28 --> 01:09:29.28
It's ineffective.

729
01:09:29.28 --> 01:09:33.92
If you're in a leadership position or someone's in a leadership position and they're failing

730
01:09:33.92 --> 01:09:38.36
and they're failing to execute the mission over and over and over again, they're a little

731
01:09:38.36 --> 01:09:41.28
tweak, they're a little leadership thing that they think is good to go.

732
01:09:41.28 --> 01:09:44.28
It's not good to go.

733
01:09:44.28 --> 01:09:48.76
And it probably, in fact, I'll tell you, it violates one of the fundamental principles

734
01:09:48.76 --> 01:09:51.08
of combat leadership.

735
01:09:51.08 --> 01:09:55.24
Okay, if you can identify which one of those things, it's violating.

736
01:09:55.24 --> 01:09:59.96
You can get them to clean it up and fix it.

737
01:09:59.96 --> 01:10:02.36
So there you go, whiz bang, don't try it.

738
01:10:02.36 --> 01:10:03.84
Don't try the whiz bang.

739
01:10:03.84 --> 01:10:04.84
I don't know though.

740
01:10:04.84 --> 01:10:09.92
I mean, these jutsu moves, you know how like guys will like bus some moves.

741
01:10:09.92 --> 01:10:10.92
Man, I don't know.

742
01:10:10.92 --> 01:10:11.92
It's this endless thing.

743
01:10:11.92 --> 01:10:12.92
Yes, jutsu moves.

744
01:10:12.92 --> 01:10:13.92
No, no moves come out.

745
01:10:13.92 --> 01:10:14.92
Yeah.

746
01:10:14.92 --> 01:10:18.92
And you won't hit a move 100% of the time and you definitely won't hit it when you first

747
01:10:18.92 --> 01:10:19.92
start doing it.

748
01:10:19.92 --> 01:10:20.92
It's going to be hard.

749
01:10:20.92 --> 01:10:25.24
Normally, arm locks, you think you put on someone before you made someone tap.

750
01:10:25.24 --> 01:10:29.20
In the beginning, you probably did 50 arm locks before you got someone to tap.

751
01:10:29.20 --> 01:10:30.20
Yeah, probably more.

752
01:10:30.20 --> 01:10:32.16
Yeah, maybe even more.

753
01:10:32.16 --> 01:10:35.76
So that doesn't mean, after the first 49 odds and effect of a mockery do I do?

754
01:10:35.76 --> 01:10:36.76
Yeah.

755
01:10:36.76 --> 01:10:39.36
The big differences, the big differences.

756
01:10:39.36 --> 01:10:42.36
An arm lock is a proven known entity.

757
01:10:42.36 --> 01:10:45.56
Covered move is a proven known entity.

758
01:10:45.56 --> 01:10:48.44
Simple is a proven known entity.

759
01:10:48.44 --> 01:10:52.000
No advertising execute is a proven known entity.

760
01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:55.80
Extreme ownership is a proven known and decentralized command is a proven.

761
01:10:55.80 --> 01:10:56.64
It's like an arm lock.

762
01:10:56.64 --> 01:10:57.64
It's like a choke.

763
01:10:57.64 --> 01:11:04.48
That's why when some people say to me, oh well, my boss doesn't like extreme ownership.

764
01:11:04.48 --> 01:11:06.36
You know, I know what's happening.

765
01:11:06.36 --> 01:11:11.000
Like it's their the boss's ego is offended because there's some other, somebody telling

766
01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:12.16
them a different way to lead.

767
01:11:12.16 --> 01:11:14.64
No, it's like, what do you believe in?

768
01:11:14.64 --> 01:11:15.68
I don't believe in extreme ownership.

769
01:11:15.68 --> 01:11:19.36
Oh, I blame and I believe in placing the blame on other people.

770
01:11:19.36 --> 01:11:20.76
That's how I lead.

771
01:11:20.76 --> 01:11:23.08
That's completely ridiculous.

772
01:11:23.08 --> 01:11:24.64
Everybody knows that's ridiculous.

773
01:11:24.64 --> 01:11:26.20
It's completely ridiculous.

774
01:11:26.20 --> 01:11:27.36
Covered move.

775
01:11:27.36 --> 01:11:28.64
I don't believe in cover, move.

776
01:11:28.64 --> 01:11:32.48
Oh, so you just like your other team members to go and take care of themselves and you

777
01:11:32.48 --> 01:11:33.96
take care of yourself.

778
01:11:33.96 --> 01:11:34.96
How does that work?

779
01:11:34.96 --> 01:11:35.96
Don't work.

780
01:11:35.96 --> 01:11:36.96
It doesn't work.

781
01:11:36.96 --> 01:11:37.96
Keep it all.

782
01:11:37.96 --> 01:11:38.96
I don't like to keep things simple.

783
01:11:38.96 --> 01:11:41.80
No, I like to make things so complicated that people don't understand what I'm talking

784
01:11:41.80 --> 01:11:42.80
about.

785
01:11:42.80 --> 01:11:44.20
Does that make any sense whatsoever?

786
01:11:44.20 --> 01:11:45.20
No, it doesn't.

787
01:11:45.20 --> 01:11:48.08
Okay, prioritize next cut.

788
01:11:48.08 --> 01:11:49.08
No, don't do that.

789
01:11:49.08 --> 01:11:52.52
What I should what I'm going to do is spread myself so thin that I don't have the

790
01:11:52.52 --> 01:11:55.36
assets or resources to actually accomplish anything.

791
01:11:55.36 --> 01:11:57.48
That's what I'm going to do because that makes sense because I don't believe in extreme

792
01:11:57.48 --> 01:12:01.28
ownership or those fundamental laws of combat leadership.

793
01:12:01.28 --> 01:12:03.08
That's where you're at decentralized command.

794
01:12:03.08 --> 01:12:05.60
Oh, I don't believe in that.

795
01:12:05.60 --> 01:12:09.40
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to make every single decision myself from the headquarters

796
01:12:09.40 --> 01:12:10.40
position.

797
01:12:10.40 --> 01:12:14.32
When you guys want to make a decision out that on the battlefield or out there on the manufacturing

798
01:12:14.32 --> 01:12:18.52
floor, I want you to run every single decision up through me because that's going to be

799
01:12:18.52 --> 01:12:20.80
effective.

800
01:12:20.80 --> 01:12:25.68
So if you violate one of these principles, you're going to have problems as a leader.

801
01:12:25.68 --> 01:12:28.40
If you tweak these principles, that's fine.

802
01:12:28.40 --> 01:12:31.36
If you look at decentralized command and you're like, you know what?

803
01:12:31.36 --> 01:12:36.12
I know that the normal kind of span of control is five people.

804
01:12:36.12 --> 01:12:37.88
I can handle more than that.

805
01:12:37.88 --> 01:12:40.20
I can handle nine and you step it up.

806
01:12:40.20 --> 01:12:41.36
That's that's tweak.

807
01:12:41.36 --> 01:12:42.36
That's okay.

808
01:12:42.36 --> 01:12:43.36
Right?

809
01:12:43.36 --> 01:12:44.28
That's fine.

810
01:12:44.28 --> 01:12:48.68
If you when you prioritize next Q, hey, the way I prioritize next Q, and this is the

811
01:12:48.68 --> 01:12:53.76
truth, the way I prioritize next Q, isn't I look at my number one problem and I only

812
01:12:53.76 --> 01:12:58.32
folks about one, I assign somebody to my number one problem.

813
01:12:58.32 --> 01:13:01.72
And I say, hey, Bill, go handle that room over there.

814
01:13:01.72 --> 01:13:03.12
It's a problem.

815
01:13:03.12 --> 01:13:07.64
And then I look at Mike and say, hey, Mike, get the rest of this hallway cleared.

816
01:13:07.64 --> 01:13:10.92
So I'm actually handling two things, but I give Bill the priority.

817
01:13:10.92 --> 01:13:11.92
Right, Lord.

818
01:13:11.92 --> 01:13:12.92
So that's a tweak.

819
01:13:12.92 --> 01:13:14.56
I'm using assets.

820
01:13:14.56 --> 01:13:16.36
That's fine.

821
01:13:16.36 --> 01:13:20.92
So sometimes, yes, you've got to make these little adjustments.

822
01:13:20.92 --> 01:13:25.68
Everyone's got a different leadership style, but you don't violate the principles of

823
01:13:25.68 --> 01:13:27.80
leadership.

824
01:13:27.80 --> 01:13:35.000
Just like you don't violate the principles of submission grappling, I'll call it.

825
01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:36.000
Yeah.

826
01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:37.000
Dig it.

827
01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
Next question.

828
01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:45.28
I'm a huge fan of the podcast, and I'd like your advice.

829
01:13:45.28 --> 01:13:49.68
When I was younger, I joined the National Guard in an attempt to do something with my

830
01:13:49.68 --> 01:13:52.44
life and get out of depression.

831
01:13:52.44 --> 01:13:59.44
I lost my discipline and goals after basic training and continued in depression and disorganization.

832
01:13:59.44 --> 01:14:05.16
I had the opportunity to go to fight to flight school, but instead tested positive on

833
01:14:05.16 --> 01:14:09.16
a drug test, and I was given a general discharge.

834
01:14:09.16 --> 01:14:12.88
I, of course, take full responsibility and feel like an idiot.

835
01:14:12.88 --> 01:14:16.04
How would you recommend moving past this failure?

836
01:14:16.04 --> 01:14:23.48
What would you have done if your seal career ended with a mistake?

837
01:14:23.48 --> 01:14:29.80
Well, if my seal career had ended with a mistake, I would have figured out what my next

838
01:14:29.80 --> 01:14:32.32
mission was going to be.

839
01:14:32.32 --> 01:14:34.64
That's what I've done.

840
01:14:34.64 --> 01:14:37.20
I mean, I would have said, OK, I like that job.

841
01:14:37.20 --> 01:14:39.68
I failed at it.

842
01:14:39.68 --> 01:14:40.84
What can I learn from that?

843
01:14:40.84 --> 01:14:46.32
And what can I do next differently to make sure I don't make that mistake again?

844
01:14:46.32 --> 01:14:49.40
I'm going to learn from the past, but I'm not going to dwell on it.

845
01:14:49.40 --> 01:14:51.52
There's no point in dwelling on it.

846
01:14:51.52 --> 01:14:53.88
The only point in dwelling on just to learn from it.

847
01:14:53.88 --> 01:14:55.52
So that's what I would do here.

848
01:14:55.52 --> 01:15:02.56
Then I would take what I learned from my experiences of where I failed.

849
01:15:02.56 --> 01:15:08.08
But I would also take the positive things that I learned because even that failure is a positive.

850
01:15:08.08 --> 01:15:12.92
Even that failure is a positive because you realize the value of the opportunity that you

851
01:15:12.92 --> 01:15:15.32
had and you blew it and you're like, OK, I'm never going to let that happen again.

852
01:15:15.32 --> 01:15:16.32
Lesson learned.

853
01:15:16.32 --> 01:15:20.32
I'm actually stoked I get to learn that lesson because it's going to be more opportunities

854
01:15:20.32 --> 01:15:21.92
that come up in life.

855
01:15:21.92 --> 01:15:28.36
And you got to make sure that you don't disregard those opportunities when they come up.

856
01:15:28.36 --> 01:15:32.92
So I would have taken those lessons learned, take that failure, and turn it into something

857
01:15:32.92 --> 01:15:34.68
positive, and made good things happen.

858
01:15:34.68 --> 01:15:41.08
When I figured out what my new mission to new career was going to be pretty straightforward.

859
01:15:41.08 --> 01:15:44.36
You can do so much good.

860
01:15:44.36 --> 01:15:50.36
Anyhow, that's going back to the story that I told about Jeff in the beginning of this podcast.

861
01:15:50.36 --> 01:15:57.16
One of the wording, some of the wording that I struggled with in the kid's story, and

862
01:15:57.16 --> 01:15:59.32
getting it's on the, it's the word your kid podcast.

863
01:15:59.32 --> 01:16:05.56
One of the things that I struggled with in telling the story was I ended up saying Jeff had gone

864
01:16:05.56 --> 01:16:09.76
too far and he couldn't correct himself.

865
01:16:09.76 --> 01:16:13.48
He had gone too far and he couldn't come back.

866
01:16:13.48 --> 01:16:22.16
And that's a real hard thing to tell a person and it's a real hard thing to tell a kid.

867
01:16:22.16 --> 01:16:27.12
And the reason why I left it that way, the reason why I kept it like, listen.

868
01:16:27.12 --> 01:16:34.000
You can make mistakes that you can't come back from, especially as a kid.

869
01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.08
You can make mistakes that you can't come back from.

870
01:16:36.08 --> 01:16:38.08
They're pretty rare, right?

871
01:16:38.08 --> 01:16:41.76
There's not too many mistakes that are so grievous that you can't recover from them.

872
01:16:41.76 --> 01:16:42.92
Like this guy.

873
01:16:42.92 --> 01:16:45.16
Hey man, he made a mistake.

874
01:16:45.16 --> 01:16:47.40
Failed a drug test, given a general discharge.

875
01:16:47.40 --> 01:16:48.40
That sucks.

876
01:16:48.40 --> 01:16:49.40
Guess what?

877
01:16:49.40 --> 01:16:51.48
He can do all kinds of good in the world.

878
01:16:51.48 --> 01:16:53.60
He can make up for that 10 fold.

879
01:16:53.60 --> 01:16:57.92
He can start a business, make money, he can create a family, he can raise great kids.

880
01:16:57.92 --> 01:17:02.84
And there's so many things that he can make sure his kids understand that and know that

881
01:17:02.84 --> 01:17:03.84
and learn from it.

882
01:17:03.84 --> 01:17:07.46
And he can make sure some other neighborhood kids and high school kids and grade school

883
01:17:07.46 --> 01:17:08.46
kids.

884
01:17:08.46 --> 01:17:11.28
He can make such an impact on the world by learning from that mistake.

885
01:17:11.28 --> 01:17:16.72
So it's very, it's a harsh thing to say like, hey, there's some things you can't.

886
01:17:16.72 --> 01:17:19.36
Now what this guy can't recover from.

887
01:17:19.36 --> 01:17:23.20
And this is what the fact that you have to face.

888
01:17:23.20 --> 01:17:26.56
And this is why I told it this way in the kid's story.

889
01:17:26.56 --> 01:17:27.92
He didn't understand.

890
01:17:27.92 --> 01:17:31.96
When he made that mistake, he didn't understand that there's some mistakes you cannot

891
01:17:31.96 --> 01:17:32.96
recover from.

892
01:17:32.96 --> 01:17:35.32
He can't be a pilot now.

893
01:17:35.32 --> 01:17:36.96
It's not going to happen.

894
01:17:36.96 --> 01:17:39.76
Zero chance of him being a military pilot.

895
01:17:39.76 --> 01:17:41.36
That's the way it works.

896
01:17:41.36 --> 01:17:45.96
So if I would have had the opportunity to tell him when he was 13 years old, hey, listen,

897
01:17:45.96 --> 01:17:47.60
bro, I get it.

898
01:17:47.60 --> 01:17:49.24
You're going to step outside the box sometimes.

899
01:17:49.24 --> 01:17:52.08
But there's some mistakes that you can make that you'll never be able to recover from.

900
01:17:52.08 --> 01:17:54.28
So think about what you're doing before you do them.

901
01:17:54.28 --> 01:17:57.80
You need to think about what you're doing before you do them.

902
01:17:57.80 --> 01:18:01.48
And if I would have had the opportunity to tell him that when he was 13 years old, he

903
01:18:01.48 --> 01:18:04.64
might have had a better decision making process when he got older.

904
01:18:04.64 --> 01:18:08.80
That's why I left it that way for those kids so that they recognize that there are some

905
01:18:08.80 --> 01:18:14.32
things that you do as a person, as a kid, that you cannot recover from.

906
01:18:14.32 --> 01:18:17.04
You cannot recover from them.

907
01:18:17.04 --> 01:18:22.04
Now that being said, when you take this and you put it in perspective as an adult,

908
01:18:22.04 --> 01:18:26.92
see an adult, you have much broader world to be a part of.

909
01:18:26.92 --> 01:18:32.000
And just because he's not going to be a pilot, a military pilot, by the way, just because

910
01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:35.32
he's not going to be a military pilot, there's all kinds of other opportunities out there.

911
01:18:35.32 --> 01:18:39.08
And you can explain that to an adult, but it's hard to explain that to a kid.

912
01:18:39.08 --> 01:18:42.12
So one of the opportunities, I mean, even if especially like, oh, you want to be a pilot,

913
01:18:42.12 --> 01:18:44.16
cool, you can become a civilian pilot.

914
01:18:44.16 --> 01:18:49.40
And you can fly, you can make things happen that way.

915
01:18:49.40 --> 01:18:54.34
But what we're not going to do and what I would not do is do well on the past and do

916
01:18:54.34 --> 01:18:59.60
well on what the big missed opportunity is because guess what, that's a missed opportunity

917
01:18:59.60 --> 01:19:03.60
that there's all kinds of people in the world would love for that to be their biggest

918
01:19:03.60 --> 01:19:04.60
mistake that they've made.

919
01:19:04.60 --> 01:19:05.60
That's it.

920
01:19:05.60 --> 01:19:08.20
They would love there's someone sitting in prison right now.

921
01:19:08.20 --> 01:19:12.08
That's like, man, I wish all I did was get a failure drug test and I could have learned

922
01:19:12.08 --> 01:19:13.08
my lesson instead.

923
01:19:13.08 --> 01:19:19.000
I'm sitting here in prison or I got injured really bad because I did something that I

924
01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:23.32
shouldn't have done or I made a bad decision or I got someone that I care about, hurt

925
01:19:23.32 --> 01:19:27.32
or injured because I took them into, you know, car when I was drunk.

926
01:19:27.32 --> 01:19:28.56
Like those are the kind of mistakes.

927
01:19:28.56 --> 01:19:29.56
This mistake.

928
01:19:29.56 --> 01:19:30.84
Sure, it's a bummer.

929
01:19:30.84 --> 01:19:31.84
Guess what?

930
01:19:31.84 --> 01:19:35.08
They're infinitely infinitely worse mistakes that he could have made.

931
01:19:35.08 --> 01:19:37.12
infinitely worse.

932
01:19:37.12 --> 01:19:40.76
So you're all right, man.

933
01:19:40.76 --> 01:19:42.32
You're okay.

934
01:19:42.32 --> 01:19:43.32
Learn from it.

935
01:19:43.32 --> 01:19:44.32
Don't dwell on it.

936
01:19:44.32 --> 01:19:48.12
Move on and go, go do something really positive in the world.

937
01:19:48.12 --> 01:19:49.12
Yeah.

938
01:19:49.12 --> 01:19:53.40
Next question.

939
01:19:53.40 --> 01:19:56.16
Hey, Jockel.

940
01:19:56.16 --> 01:20:02.40
What can we do with a coworker who isn't on board when someone brings up something to him?

941
01:20:02.40 --> 01:20:06.44
He gets defensive and turns it into being everyone else's problem.

942
01:20:06.44 --> 01:20:07.44
Hmm.

943
01:20:07.44 --> 01:20:11.88
This is a Twitter question by the way.

944
01:20:11.88 --> 01:20:15.96
And I answered it and I answered it really simply, really straightforward.

945
01:20:15.96 --> 01:20:18.04
Take ownership of the problem and solve it.

946
01:20:18.04 --> 01:20:20.04
Take ownership of the problem and fix it.

947
01:20:20.04 --> 01:20:21.04
Yeah.

948
01:20:21.04 --> 01:20:24.04
Because think about what's happening here.

949
01:20:24.04 --> 01:20:28.92
What the person is saying, like, oh, this is me saying, oh, echo won't take ownership

950
01:20:28.92 --> 01:20:29.92
of the problem.

951
01:20:29.92 --> 01:20:32.80
Every time I tell him he does something wrong, he just gets defensive.

952
01:20:32.80 --> 01:20:36.28
So I mean, obviously, I'm not communicating with you well enough.

953
01:20:36.28 --> 01:20:40.44
If all I'm doing is blaming you and you're getting defensive and by the way, if I'm

954
01:20:40.44 --> 01:20:44.72
the type of person that takes ownership of things, why am I blaming you in the first place?

955
01:20:44.72 --> 01:20:48.52
I should be looking at myself.

956
01:20:48.52 --> 01:20:51.40
I should be looking at myself and by the way, if echo, if you point your fingers at me and

957
01:20:51.40 --> 01:20:53.16
you say, hey, this is my fault, you know what I say?

958
01:20:53.16 --> 01:20:54.16
Yeah, I agree.

959
01:20:54.16 --> 01:20:55.16
It is my fault.

960
01:20:55.16 --> 01:20:57.60
And here's what I'm going to do to fix it.

961
01:20:57.60 --> 01:20:59.72
Now I'm not going to rub it in your face.

962
01:20:59.72 --> 01:21:02.60
I'm not going to do it, so I prove a point.

963
01:21:02.60 --> 01:21:03.60
That's not what I'm doing.

964
01:21:03.60 --> 01:21:05.32
I'm actually doing it because I want to win.

965
01:21:05.32 --> 01:21:07.92
I'm actually doing it because I want to accomplish this mission.

966
01:21:07.92 --> 01:21:11.56
That's why I'm going to fix the problem.

967
01:21:11.56 --> 01:21:15.12
Now if we have a weak member of the team that doesn't take ownership, then guess what?

968
01:21:15.12 --> 01:21:17.88
It's my responsibility to take ownership of the problem and fix it.

969
01:21:17.88 --> 01:21:21.28
And eventually, but the good thing about this is if you make an excuse about something and

970
01:21:21.28 --> 01:21:22.92
I fix that excuse.

971
01:21:22.92 --> 01:21:25.16
And then you make an excuse about something else, I fix that one.

972
01:21:25.16 --> 01:21:27.76
And then you make an excuse about something else and I fix that one.

973
01:21:27.76 --> 01:21:30.32
Eventually, there's no more excuses for you.

974
01:21:30.32 --> 01:21:37.16
And now you're left with what you can actually handle as echo with no more excuses to make.

975
01:21:37.16 --> 01:21:38.60
And then either you're capable or you're not.

976
01:21:38.60 --> 01:21:45.60
And by the way, guess what? As the leader, then it's becomes my job to get rid of you.

977
01:21:45.60 --> 01:21:50.80
If you cannot do the thing that I asked you to do or that you're supposed to do for the

978
01:21:50.80 --> 01:21:52.80
team.

979
01:21:52.80 --> 01:22:00.20
So yeah, because eventually, if I keep stepping up and taking things away from you, there's

980
01:22:00.20 --> 01:22:01.80
not going to be any more excuses.

981
01:22:01.80 --> 01:22:06.88
And you'll either end up with no responsibility and therefore no value and then you have

982
01:22:06.88 --> 01:22:07.88
no job.

983
01:22:07.88 --> 01:22:08.88
That's the way it works.

984
01:22:08.88 --> 01:22:13.60
Now, let me ask you this.

985
01:22:13.60 --> 01:22:24.60
When is there a time that a subordinate does something and it's not the leader's fault?

986
01:22:24.60 --> 01:22:27.84
So think about this.

987
01:22:27.84 --> 01:22:37.56
And when something goes wrong with a team member, when is it not the leaders of fault?

988
01:22:37.56 --> 01:22:43.28
So if you got a machine gunner and the machine gunner shoots outside of his field of

989
01:22:43.28 --> 01:22:47.16
fire, clearly he didn't pay attention during the brief.

990
01:22:47.16 --> 01:22:49.32
That's the problem.

991
01:22:49.32 --> 01:22:54.20
If I have a machine gunner, that engages non-hospital targets.

992
01:22:54.20 --> 01:22:57.36
This machine gunner's fault because he didn't do improper.

993
01:22:57.36 --> 01:23:05.04
He did improper positive identification of his targets and engaged a friendlies or at least

994
01:23:05.04 --> 01:23:06.92
non-hospitals.

995
01:23:06.92 --> 01:23:07.92
So that's the machine gunner's fault.

996
01:23:07.92 --> 01:23:13.24
Or the machine gunner's weapon goes down because the machine gunner didn't clean.

997
01:23:13.24 --> 01:23:15.000
It's his fault because he didn't clean his weapon.

998
01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:16.16
Maintain his weapon properly.

999
01:23:16.16 --> 01:23:17.80
The machine gunner's fault.

1000
01:23:17.80 --> 01:23:19.16
So all those things.

1001
01:23:19.16 --> 01:23:20.72
The machine gunner shoots out of his field of fire.

1002
01:23:20.72 --> 01:23:22.36
The machine gunner engages non-hospital targets.

1003
01:23:22.36 --> 01:23:24.04
The machine gunner's weapon goes down.

1004
01:23:24.04 --> 01:23:25.92
All those are the machine gunner's fault.

1005
01:23:25.92 --> 01:23:29.80
Clearly.

1006
01:23:29.80 --> 01:23:32.36
Or maybe not so clearly.

1007
01:23:32.36 --> 01:23:35.48
Because here's how I would look at those things.

1008
01:23:35.48 --> 01:23:38.68
That's by the way, if you're my machine gunner, I put my finger at you and start yelling

1009
01:23:38.68 --> 01:23:40.56
at you and telling you that you did something wrong.

1010
01:23:40.56 --> 01:23:41.72
Obviously we know what happens.

1011
01:23:41.72 --> 01:23:47.24
You start making excuses and blaming other people and you don't accept irresponsible

1012
01:23:47.24 --> 01:23:49.48
because you get defensive and that's what people do.

1013
01:23:49.48 --> 01:23:56.32
So for me and what a good leader does is a good leader when the machine gunner shoots

1014
01:23:56.32 --> 01:23:59.80
out of his field of fire, the leader says, oh, you know what?

1015
01:23:59.80 --> 01:24:03.64
I didn't explain the fields of fire clearly enough for you.

1016
01:24:03.64 --> 01:24:04.64
I'm sorry.

1017
01:24:04.64 --> 01:24:05.40
I'll fix it.

1018
01:24:05.40 --> 01:24:08.96
The machine gunner engages on non-hospital target.

1019
01:24:08.96 --> 01:24:14.56
Then the leader says, hey, I should have given you better training on target identification.

1020
01:24:14.56 --> 01:24:18.88
We will go back and fix that.

1021
01:24:18.88 --> 01:24:21.24
Or the machine gunner's weapon goes down.

1022
01:24:21.24 --> 01:24:23.48
It means that, hey, as the leader, you know what?

1023
01:24:23.48 --> 01:24:27.20
I should have done a better job inspecting weapons.

1024
01:24:27.20 --> 01:24:30.52
I should have explained how important the maintenance was.

1025
01:24:30.52 --> 01:24:31.36
That's my fault.

1026
01:24:31.36 --> 01:24:34.60
I won't let it happen again.

1027
01:24:34.60 --> 01:24:40.000
So even in these instances where it's real easy to blame the individual, a good leader

1028
01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:47.08
instead of blaming the individual will take ownership of the problem.

1029
01:24:47.08 --> 01:24:49.72
That's what you do and that's what's going on in this case.

1030
01:24:49.72 --> 01:24:53.56
You've got a coworker that's not on board and just gets defensive and turns into everyone

1031
01:24:53.56 --> 01:24:54.56
else's problem.

1032
01:24:54.56 --> 01:24:56.20
That's right.

1033
01:24:56.20 --> 01:24:58.000
Grab ownership of those problems.

1034
01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:03.60
And by the way, the support that's not taking ownership, that's your fault as a leader.

1035
01:25:03.60 --> 01:25:08.44
And the way that you get someone to take ownership isn't by saying, hey, don't get

1036
01:25:08.44 --> 01:25:09.44
defensive.

1037
01:25:09.44 --> 01:25:10.44
You need to take ownership of this problem.

1038
01:25:10.44 --> 01:25:14.64
That doesn't make people take ownership.

1039
01:25:14.64 --> 01:25:15.64
Here's the tricky part.

1040
01:25:15.64 --> 01:25:18.32
Here's the black belt situation.

1041
01:25:18.32 --> 01:25:22.36
The black belt situation is if I want you to take ownership instead of blaming you,

1042
01:25:22.36 --> 01:25:24.64
I'm going to take ownership of the problem.

1043
01:25:24.64 --> 01:25:28.16
I'm going to relieve you of that.

1044
01:25:28.16 --> 01:25:29.16
And now you're going to go out.

1045
01:25:29.16 --> 01:25:30.16
No, no, no, no, no.

1046
01:25:30.16 --> 01:25:31.72
I should be able to fix that.

1047
01:25:31.72 --> 01:25:32.96
I'm sorry boss.

1048
01:25:32.96 --> 01:25:33.96
I'm sorry, Jockel.

1049
01:25:33.96 --> 01:25:36.52
I should just shop my, I shouldn't have shot outside the field of fire.

1050
01:25:36.52 --> 01:25:38.12
I need to pay better attention during the brief.

1051
01:25:38.12 --> 01:25:41.60
If I don't know what it was, I'm going to ask questions next time.

1052
01:25:41.60 --> 01:25:42.60
Are you sure?

1053
01:25:42.60 --> 01:25:43.60
Yes, I'm sure.

1054
01:25:43.60 --> 01:25:44.80
Please.

1055
01:25:44.80 --> 01:25:46.36
Let me get it fixed.

1056
01:25:46.36 --> 01:25:49.60
And that is how you get someone to take ownership.

1057
01:25:49.60 --> 01:25:53.04
You don't get people to take ownership by telling them to take ownership of things.

1058
01:25:53.04 --> 01:25:56.80
And there's a little dichotomy here, too.

1059
01:25:56.80 --> 01:26:00.40
Because if it's a plan, then the way I get you to take ownership of it is by saying,

1060
01:26:00.40 --> 01:26:02.20
hey, echo, come up with a plan.

1061
01:26:02.20 --> 01:26:04.08
We talked about standard operating procedures earlier.

1062
01:26:04.08 --> 01:26:07.44
If I come up with a standard operating procedure myself and then I force them onto you,

1063
01:26:07.44 --> 01:26:09.52
you don't take ownership of those.

1064
01:26:09.52 --> 01:26:10.52
Those are mine.

1065
01:26:10.52 --> 01:26:12.28
So I have to give you ownership.

1066
01:26:12.28 --> 01:26:14.80
But when it's a negative, it's one of the positive things I give it to you.

1067
01:26:14.80 --> 01:26:21.52
When it's a negative thing, I take it.

1068
01:26:21.52 --> 01:26:23.32
I take it.

1069
01:26:23.32 --> 01:26:24.32
Positive thing?

1070
01:26:24.32 --> 01:26:25.32
Give it.

1071
01:26:25.32 --> 01:26:28.80
Because people want that positive thing.

1072
01:26:28.80 --> 01:26:33.84
And it's a negative thing they don't want it, you take it from them.

1073
01:26:33.84 --> 01:26:36.28
And by the way, when it's a positive thing, and you give it to them, guess what they want

1074
01:26:36.28 --> 01:26:37.28
to do with it?

1075
01:26:37.28 --> 01:26:38.28
They want to share it.

1076
01:26:38.28 --> 01:26:39.28
They want to do it.

1077
01:26:39.28 --> 01:26:45.48
When it's a negative thing, and you force on them, they want to get rid of it.

1078
01:26:45.48 --> 01:26:47.64
So there you go.

1079
01:26:47.64 --> 01:26:50.16
I'm glad that this person's in the game.

1080
01:26:50.16 --> 01:26:54.68
And now they know on a handle, let's cut work here and make it into a good situation.

1081
01:26:54.68 --> 01:27:01.04
I think we got time for one more.

1082
01:27:01.04 --> 01:27:02.04
Last question.

1083
01:27:02.04 --> 01:27:03.04
Jocca.

1084
01:27:03.04 --> 01:27:04.04
Hey, Jocca.

1085
01:27:04.04 --> 01:27:11.84
How do you implement change when you know it is needed?

1086
01:27:11.84 --> 01:27:19.64
How do you implement change when you know what is needed to well?

1087
01:27:19.64 --> 01:27:23.84
And I know I need to change something.

1088
01:27:23.84 --> 01:27:28.28
What I do is I change it.

1089
01:27:28.28 --> 01:27:29.28
That's what I do.

1090
01:27:29.28 --> 01:27:31.36
I change it.

1091
01:27:31.36 --> 01:27:37.88
And I've had people that listen to the podcast, and they've reached out to me over the past

1092
01:27:37.88 --> 01:27:39.88
few years.

1093
01:27:39.88 --> 01:27:48.76
And one of the main messages that they took and put into action was actually putting things

1094
01:27:48.76 --> 01:27:50.44
into action.

1095
01:27:50.44 --> 01:27:54.56
Whatever that was, they stopped eating sugar.

1096
01:27:54.56 --> 01:27:56.56
They stopped sleeping in.

1097
01:27:56.56 --> 01:27:58.36
They started waking up early.

1098
01:27:58.36 --> 01:28:04.32
They quit playing video games for 10 or 12 or 14 hours a day.

1099
01:28:04.32 --> 01:28:07.88
They sold that Xbox thing.

1100
01:28:07.88 --> 01:28:13.64
There was a guy that bit his nails for his whole life.

1101
01:28:13.64 --> 01:28:15.36
He's like 30s.

1102
01:28:15.36 --> 01:28:16.36
Hey, whatever.

1103
01:28:16.36 --> 01:28:17.36
No big deals.

1104
01:28:17.36 --> 01:28:18.36
You know, he bit his nails.

1105
01:28:18.36 --> 01:28:19.36
Oh, you know what?

1106
01:28:19.36 --> 01:28:22.36
His nails are all chewed up in their bloody and their gross look in it.

1107
01:28:22.36 --> 01:28:25.52
He's self conscious when he's meeting people and shaking hands.

1108
01:28:25.52 --> 01:28:30.60
And he can't keep his hands away from his mouth while he's in meetings or interacting

1109
01:28:30.60 --> 01:28:33.56
with people.

1110
01:28:33.56 --> 01:28:37.28
But he couldn't stop.

1111
01:28:37.28 --> 01:28:39.72
And then he stopped.

1112
01:28:39.72 --> 01:28:41.16
He just stopped.

1113
01:28:41.16 --> 01:28:43.56
And the list goes on.

1114
01:28:43.56 --> 01:28:48.16
There's people that are quite drinking and quit doing drugs and quit losing their

1115
01:28:48.16 --> 01:28:55.56
temper and I've heard from so many different people that have implemented change in their

1116
01:28:55.56 --> 01:29:01.28
lives, so so many letters and messages and notes.

1117
01:29:01.28 --> 01:29:08.24
And I want you to know that these people aren't a bunch of elite special operations warriors.

1118
01:29:08.24 --> 01:29:09.60
That's not who they are.

1119
01:29:09.60 --> 01:29:18.12
They aren't a bunch of high level athletes or highly screened and highly trained individuals.

1120
01:29:18.12 --> 01:29:23.12
These are just just normal people.

1121
01:29:23.12 --> 01:29:25.56
Really.

1122
01:29:25.56 --> 01:29:32.20
But they're normal people that knew they needed to make a change.

1123
01:29:32.20 --> 01:29:42.92
And they decided they were going to make a change and then they made it.

1124
01:29:42.92 --> 01:29:51.32
And that is what I do and that is what you can do too.

1125
01:29:51.32 --> 01:30:05.64
If you have something to change, if you want to change something, change it, change it.

1126
01:30:05.64 --> 01:30:14.36
Wow.

1127
01:30:14.36 --> 01:30:16.20
And I think that's all I've got for tonight.

1128
01:30:16.20 --> 01:30:27.16
So echo speaking of implementing change and change in our lives to become a little bit

1129
01:30:27.16 --> 01:30:28.16
better.

1130
01:30:28.16 --> 01:30:32.000
Maybe you could help us with some things that can make us better.

1131
01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:33.000
Sure.

1132
01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.96
First, what's up with Mike in the Dragons?

1133
01:30:35.96 --> 01:30:36.96
Mike in the Dragons.

1134
01:30:36.96 --> 01:30:37.96
Yes.

1135
01:30:37.96 --> 01:30:44.68
So Mike in the Dragons is released into the world.

1136
01:30:44.68 --> 01:30:45.68
Now, okay.

1137
01:30:45.68 --> 01:30:50.44
So speaking of ownership and I know one of the earlier questions was about ownership and

1138
01:30:50.44 --> 01:30:57.20
I have to take ownership myself at this time because I made a mistake.

1139
01:30:57.20 --> 01:30:58.20
I made a mistake.

1140
01:30:58.20 --> 01:31:05.72
Just as I, as you pointed out, as I've talked about my publisher not ordering enough

1141
01:31:05.72 --> 01:31:08.88
books and how, hey, they don't order enough books.

1142
01:31:08.88 --> 01:31:09.88
They don't get it.

1143
01:31:09.88 --> 01:31:10.88
Well, guess what?

1144
01:31:10.88 --> 01:31:14.16
I didn't order enough books.

1145
01:31:14.16 --> 01:31:18.16
So I am getting them printed right now.

1146
01:31:18.16 --> 01:31:23.76
I'm getting them printed as fast as humanly possible.

1147
01:31:23.76 --> 01:31:26.84
We have multiple printers working.

1148
01:31:26.84 --> 01:31:31.40
And if you ordered early, you're likely going to get yours on the release date.

1149
01:31:31.40 --> 01:31:36.72
And I know some people have been posting their Amazon images that their Mike in the Dragons

1150
01:31:36.72 --> 01:31:37.72
is shipping.

1151
01:31:37.72 --> 01:31:41.24
So some people are going to get it soon.

1152
01:31:41.24 --> 01:31:43.76
But even that's not a guarantee at this point.

1153
01:31:43.76 --> 01:31:45.72
Even if you ordered early, I apologize.

1154
01:31:45.72 --> 01:31:47.08
Don't blame Amazon.

1155
01:31:47.08 --> 01:31:48.08
It's not their fault.

1156
01:31:48.08 --> 01:31:51.76
Don't blame FedEx and don't blame the post office and don't blame UPS.

1157
01:31:51.76 --> 01:31:52.76
It's not their fault.

1158
01:31:52.76 --> 01:31:56.24
If you don't get the book on time, it is one person's fault.

1159
01:31:56.24 --> 01:31:57.24
And that is mine.

1160
01:31:57.24 --> 01:32:03.80
I should have done a much better job of estimating how many books you will all were going

1161
01:32:03.80 --> 01:32:04.80
to buy.

1162
01:32:04.80 --> 01:32:11.04
And I guess as soon as I saw people that were ordering 12 books, 12 Mikey in the Dragons,

1163
01:32:11.04 --> 01:32:15.92
that should have been real indicator that I should have gotten more printed.

1164
01:32:15.92 --> 01:32:17.08
But I didn't do that.

1165
01:32:17.08 --> 01:32:19.44
I apologize.

1166
01:32:19.44 --> 01:32:21.64
You guys have ordered a ton.

1167
01:32:21.64 --> 01:32:25.68
And so at this point, I have a ton more being printed.

1168
01:32:25.68 --> 01:32:27.88
Our goal is to get them to you by Christmas.

1169
01:32:27.88 --> 01:32:29.000
It should be possible.

1170
01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.68
If you order now, we've got enough coming in.

1171
01:32:31.68 --> 01:32:36.96
They should be there to get in the stockings for Christmas.

1172
01:32:36.96 --> 01:32:42.64
If you've ordered, so if you've ordered though, be patient.

1173
01:32:42.64 --> 01:32:50.72
If you haven't ordered yet order like right now, so that I can print more.

1174
01:32:50.72 --> 01:32:52.80
And like I said, right now, we should have enough.

1175
01:32:52.80 --> 01:32:58.80
If you order right now, you should be able to get it by Christmas.

1176
01:32:58.80 --> 01:33:02.04
And if you want it, yeah, just order it.

1177
01:33:02.04 --> 01:33:04.32
And I'll just get as many printed as we need.

1178
01:33:04.32 --> 01:33:06.04
I apologize.

1179
01:33:06.04 --> 01:33:08.24
It's definitely my fault.

1180
01:33:08.24 --> 01:33:10.56
I was weak.

1181
01:33:10.56 --> 01:33:11.84
I was, you weren't weak.

1182
01:33:11.84 --> 01:33:13.76
No, what was I used to call it weak?

1183
01:33:13.76 --> 01:33:15.72
And then you'd be like, they're just being conservative.

1184
01:33:15.72 --> 01:33:16.72
So I was too conservative.

1185
01:33:16.72 --> 01:33:21.84
I balanced it too much in the wrong direction.

1186
01:33:21.84 --> 01:33:23.88
So order the book.

1187
01:33:23.88 --> 01:33:30.36
And I appreciate the few people that I've sent a copy to, the feedback has been awesome.

1188
01:33:30.36 --> 01:33:35.32
The book in the words of John Bosch, who did the drawing into the art.

1189
01:33:35.32 --> 01:33:39.20
And you're going to see, he's the same guy that the art for way the warrior kid.

1190
01:33:39.20 --> 01:33:43.24
This art is a totally different deal because it's beautiful.

1191
01:33:43.24 --> 01:33:44.24
It's color.

1192
01:33:44.24 --> 01:33:45.24
It's vibrant.

1193
01:33:45.24 --> 01:33:46.24
vibrant.

1194
01:33:46.24 --> 01:33:49.40
Yeah, he did an amazing job.

1195
01:33:49.40 --> 01:33:58.04
And he said to me, he's like, any old people say things and they say it in a certain way.

1196
01:33:58.04 --> 01:33:59.04
He did that.

1197
01:33:59.04 --> 01:34:04.12
He just goes, this book is special.

1198
01:34:04.12 --> 01:34:09.08
And I was like, you know the way he said it was like, and I feel that way, but you know,

1199
01:34:09.08 --> 01:34:12.72
of course, I'm biased because I wrote it.

1200
01:34:12.72 --> 01:34:15.28
But when he drew it, so he's biased too.

1201
01:34:15.28 --> 01:34:17.64
But he didn't say it like, hey, this book is awesome.

1202
01:34:17.64 --> 01:34:19.12
Normal voice.

1203
01:34:19.12 --> 01:34:24.40
He was like, he was like, hey, this book is, this book is really special.

1204
01:34:24.40 --> 01:34:29.000
And I was like, okay, so I think this book is going to be on every kid's bookshelf.

1205
01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:33.28
I think it's going to be right next to their copy of where the wild things are.

1206
01:34:33.28 --> 01:34:37.24
That's what I think, which was one of all of our favorite books when you're a kid.

1207
01:34:37.24 --> 01:34:38.88
And I know that's a bold statement.

1208
01:34:38.88 --> 01:34:41.08
But anyways, I think it's going to have a great impact on kids.

1209
01:34:41.08 --> 01:34:46.68
So if you want a copy for your kids, for your neighbor kids, for your library, your school,

1210
01:34:46.68 --> 01:34:52.08
whatever classrooms, for yourself, for yourself.

1211
01:34:52.08 --> 01:35:01.000
Yes, if you're 38 years old, and you want to learn a little something about the world,

1212
01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:03.60
about overcoming fear, about how to face things.

1213
01:35:03.60 --> 01:35:10.04
And you want to have it put in such a clear way, then get yourself a copy.

1214
01:35:10.04 --> 01:35:13.68
So right, echo, then you've read it.

1215
01:35:13.68 --> 01:35:14.68
I mean, obviously.

1216
01:35:14.68 --> 01:35:17.28
Yes or how. And you've read it to your youngsters.

1217
01:35:17.28 --> 01:35:18.48
Yes, I have.

1218
01:35:18.48 --> 01:35:20.000
And they're approved.

1219
01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:21.000
Approved.

1220
01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:22.64
Yeah, she wants me to read it again.

1221
01:35:22.64 --> 01:35:23.84
Okay.

1222
01:35:23.84 --> 01:35:27.20
Well, this one, this is a book that takes 20 minutes to read.

1223
01:35:27.20 --> 01:35:30.20
Yeah, maybe 20, maybe yeah, but around 20 minutes to read.

1224
01:35:30.20 --> 01:35:31.04
Yeah.

1225
01:35:31.04 --> 01:35:35.64
So it rhymes, which is fun.

1226
01:35:35.64 --> 01:35:36.64
Yes.

1227
01:35:36.64 --> 01:35:38.88
And impactful in little kids.

1228
01:35:38.88 --> 01:35:40.24
They love it when those things rhyme.

1229
01:35:40.24 --> 01:35:41.36
Yeah, yeah, they fought.

1230
01:35:41.36 --> 01:35:42.36
Yeah.

1231
01:35:42.36 --> 01:35:43.08
They follow it.

1232
01:35:43.08 --> 01:35:44.44
So there you go.

1233
01:35:44.44 --> 01:35:49.24
If you want one again, I apologize if you're not, if you don't get it on the 15th of November,

1234
01:35:49.24 --> 01:35:51.48
my goal is to add a minimum.

1235
01:35:51.48 --> 01:35:53.24
Some of you are going to get it on the 50th of you order it early.

1236
01:35:53.24 --> 01:35:54.44
Hopefully you'll get it by then.

1237
01:35:54.44 --> 01:35:57.72
But my goal, let's get it to you by Christmas.

1238
01:35:57.72 --> 01:36:02.48
I've got publishers all over our printers all over printing it.

1239
01:36:02.48 --> 01:36:04.44
So thank you.

1240
01:36:04.44 --> 01:36:07.24
And that's that.

1241
01:36:07.24 --> 01:36:08.72
Mike, you and the dragons.

1242
01:36:08.72 --> 01:36:09.72
Cool.

1243
01:36:09.72 --> 01:36:10.72
What else?

1244
01:36:10.72 --> 01:36:11.72
What else we need?

1245
01:36:11.72 --> 01:36:14.40
Well, how else can we implement change in our lives?

1246
01:36:14.40 --> 01:36:15.40
Sure.

1247
01:36:15.40 --> 01:36:16.88
Well, let you just talk today.

1248
01:36:16.88 --> 01:36:24.48
Once you know the way broadly you will, in fact, see it in all things.

1249
01:36:24.48 --> 01:36:31.16
So when you are exploring the road of jujitsu, you're going to need a key.

1250
01:36:31.16 --> 01:36:34.88
Even if you do just no get well, if you don't, if you only do no get that I guess you don't

1251
01:36:34.88 --> 01:36:35.88
need a key.

1252
01:36:35.88 --> 01:36:40.16
But when you are searching for a key, get it origin key.

1253
01:36:40.16 --> 01:36:41.16
That's it.

1254
01:36:41.16 --> 01:36:42.16
100%.

1255
01:36:42.16 --> 01:36:43.16
Yeah.

1256
01:36:43.16 --> 01:36:44.88
You origin main dot com.

1257
01:36:44.88 --> 01:36:45.88
That's where you get it.

1258
01:36:45.88 --> 01:36:47.92
Rushcards and there's well on the river.

1259
01:36:47.92 --> 01:36:49.12
Moving in America.

1260
01:36:49.12 --> 01:36:50.12
In America.

1261
01:36:50.12 --> 01:36:51.12
Cotton.

1262
01:36:51.12 --> 01:36:52.12
All the cotton.

1263
01:36:52.12 --> 01:36:53.12
Grown in America.

1264
01:36:53.12 --> 01:36:54.12
In America.

1265
01:36:54.12 --> 01:36:55.12
And in America.

1266
01:36:55.12 --> 01:36:56.12
In America.

1267
01:36:56.12 --> 01:36:57.76
By the way, it's not just cotton.

1268
01:36:57.76 --> 01:36:59.72
It's a special blend.

1269
01:36:59.72 --> 01:37:00.72
Yeah.

1270
01:37:00.72 --> 01:37:01.72
And a special weave by the way.

1271
01:37:01.72 --> 01:37:02.52
No, it's special weave.

1272
01:37:02.52 --> 01:37:03.72
How cool is that weave?

1273
01:37:03.72 --> 01:37:04.72
Like, like, no kidding.

1274
01:37:04.72 --> 01:37:09.84
When you see dragon weave for the first time, are you not like a little bit?

1275
01:37:09.84 --> 01:37:10.84
A little bit.

1276
01:37:10.84 --> 01:37:11.84
Impressive.

1277
01:37:11.84 --> 01:37:12.84
Yeah.

1278
01:37:12.84 --> 01:37:15.80
Use a thing too when you kind of been in the game for a long time.

1279
01:37:15.80 --> 01:37:18.48
Let's say you're not easily impressed by Giz.

1280
01:37:18.48 --> 01:37:20.48
Well, no, yeah.

1281
01:37:20.48 --> 01:37:22.68
No, not generally speaking, no.

1282
01:37:22.68 --> 01:37:23.92
But you do pay attention.

1283
01:37:23.92 --> 01:37:25.60
Like you don't when you grab a Giz, you're own Giz.

1284
01:37:25.60 --> 01:37:26.72
You're really used to your own Giz.

1285
01:37:26.72 --> 01:37:29.68
If you have two Giz, three Giz, four Giz and they're all kind of different ways, you know

1286
01:37:29.68 --> 01:37:30.68
those, right?

1287
01:37:30.68 --> 01:37:34.16
So when you see someone else with a Giz, you're like, okay, you know, I'm familiar with

1288
01:37:34.16 --> 01:37:35.16
whatever.

1289
01:37:35.16 --> 01:37:36.16
Cool.

1290
01:37:36.16 --> 01:37:39.16
But when you grab the dragon weave for the first time, especially when you've been in the

1291
01:37:39.16 --> 01:37:41.60
game for a while, you're like, ooh, this one is different.

1292
01:37:41.60 --> 01:37:42.60
Like that.

1293
01:37:42.60 --> 01:37:45.56
Well, I've definitely had a couple of people that only got into Giz.

1294
01:37:45.56 --> 01:37:47.44
Like they've only, Dave Burke.

1295
01:37:47.44 --> 01:37:48.44
Good to do it.

1296
01:37:48.44 --> 01:37:49.44
Yeah.

1297
01:37:49.44 --> 01:37:50.44
He's only had origin Giz.

1298
01:37:50.44 --> 01:37:53.08
It's just, he's just, he's just, he's just, he doesn't even know what.

1299
01:37:53.08 --> 01:37:56.68
All these other stories about bad Giz, he doesn't even understand the stories.

1300
01:37:56.68 --> 01:37:59.88
Like, oh, oh, they just, they're stinking.

1301
01:37:59.88 --> 01:38:01.44
They're heavy and all they written.

1302
01:38:01.44 --> 01:38:02.44
Oh, that's stuff.

1303
01:38:02.44 --> 01:38:03.44
He doesn't know anybody better than you.

1304
01:38:03.44 --> 01:38:04.44
Yeah.

1305
01:38:04.44 --> 01:38:05.44
Yeah.

1306
01:38:05.44 --> 01:38:06.44
Yeah.

1307
01:38:06.44 --> 01:38:07.44
Yeah.

1308
01:38:07.44 --> 01:38:09.44
So in a way, I kind of want to say, hey, dang, that's good for him.

1309
01:38:09.44 --> 01:38:10.44
He's lucky in that way.

1310
01:38:10.44 --> 01:38:13.16
But, hey, that's part of the game.

1311
01:38:13.16 --> 01:38:14.16
It's part of the journey.

1312
01:38:14.16 --> 01:38:15.16
Yeah.

1313
01:38:15.16 --> 01:38:18.28
Nonetheless, whether you do it or not, you do it, drag and leave is legit.

1314
01:38:18.28 --> 01:38:22.20
Are we allowed to talk about that new weave that we were exploring the other day at

1315
01:38:22.20 --> 01:38:23.20
your house?

1316
01:38:23.20 --> 01:38:24.20
Not yet.

1317
01:38:24.20 --> 01:38:25.20
Okay.

1318
01:38:25.20 --> 01:38:27.36
We're going to keep our beaks buttoned.

1319
01:38:27.36 --> 01:38:28.36
Yeah.

1320
01:38:28.36 --> 01:38:30.32
Don't forget about rash guards, though.

1321
01:38:30.32 --> 01:38:31.32
Yes, of course.

1322
01:38:31.32 --> 01:38:34.04
So when you're doing no guis, some people that use the t-shirt, I dig it.

1323
01:38:34.04 --> 01:38:35.64
Some people that use the dry fit.

1324
01:38:35.64 --> 01:38:36.84
I dig it.

1325
01:38:36.84 --> 01:38:38.80
To me, rash guard is the way to go.

1326
01:38:38.80 --> 01:38:40.16
This is why.

1327
01:38:40.16 --> 01:38:45.40
Because other people's toes, sometimes not all the time, could get caught in that shirt

1328
01:38:45.40 --> 01:38:48.20
when it's flopping around the wind.

1329
01:38:48.20 --> 01:38:49.20
True.

1330
01:38:49.20 --> 01:38:50.92
And, you know, hey, you know, it's a rash guard.

1331
01:38:50.92 --> 01:38:51.92
It's cool.

1332
01:38:51.92 --> 01:38:52.92
It looks more uniformy.

1333
01:38:52.92 --> 01:38:57.60
What about the scientific compression increased?

1334
01:38:57.60 --> 01:38:58.60
A fast-gatherty.

1335
01:38:58.60 --> 01:38:59.60
I'm scared of that.

1336
01:38:59.60 --> 01:39:00.60
Yeah.

1337
01:39:00.60 --> 01:39:01.60
Not, hey, man, I'm sure there is that.

1338
01:39:01.60 --> 01:39:02.60
There is that.

1339
01:39:02.60 --> 01:39:03.60
Yeah.

1340
01:39:03.60 --> 01:39:07.20
Oh, when you were the rash guard, when you were the compression clothing.

1341
01:39:07.20 --> 01:39:08.68
Yeah, like, helps with that durian.

1342
01:39:08.68 --> 01:39:10.56
And that's cool.

1343
01:39:10.56 --> 01:39:12.000
I'm not over here making those plans.

1344
01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:13.000
Yeah.

1345
01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:14.000
I am making this claim.

1346
01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:16.40
19% improvement when you were in the rash guard.

1347
01:39:16.40 --> 01:39:20.60
Based on your whole mental state.

1348
01:39:20.60 --> 01:39:21.60
Yes.

1349
01:39:21.60 --> 01:39:22.60
Agreed.

1350
01:39:22.60 --> 01:39:23.60
Get some.

1351
01:39:23.60 --> 01:39:24.60
Yeah.

1352
01:39:24.60 --> 01:39:27.84
And not to mention, speaking of mental state, on those days that you don't want

1353
01:39:27.84 --> 01:39:29.68
to train, get a new rash guard.

1354
01:39:29.68 --> 01:39:32.12
Those days they don't exist anymore.

1355
01:39:32.12 --> 01:39:34.12
And these ever formants.

1356
01:39:34.12 --> 01:39:36.48
Then you need another new rash guard.

1357
01:39:36.48 --> 01:39:38.92
Yeah, you're right.

1358
01:39:38.92 --> 01:39:39.92
So yeah, cool.

1359
01:39:39.92 --> 01:39:40.92
The compression.

1360
01:39:40.92 --> 01:39:41.92
Cool.

1361
01:39:41.92 --> 01:39:42.92
Yeah.

1362
01:39:42.92 --> 01:39:43.92
He was actually starting to go into it with me.

1363
01:39:43.92 --> 01:39:46.20
Hey, man, I could tell you, I'm like, well, man, let me go.

1364
01:39:46.20 --> 01:39:47.20
It's good.

1365
01:39:47.20 --> 01:39:50.60
We just go 19% improvement based on mental state.

1366
01:39:50.60 --> 01:39:51.60
Getting after it.

1367
01:39:51.60 --> 01:39:52.60
Yes.

1368
01:39:52.60 --> 01:39:53.60
Agreed.

1369
01:39:53.60 --> 01:39:55.20
So, yeah, some good rash guard down there.

1370
01:39:55.20 --> 01:39:59.20
Also, some, well, how should I say lounge gear?

1371
01:39:59.20 --> 01:40:00.20
Expression and so on.

1372
01:40:00.20 --> 01:40:02.40
That violates your whole thing.

1373
01:40:02.40 --> 01:40:03.80
The violates everything.

1374
01:40:03.80 --> 01:40:04.80
Lounge.

1375
01:40:04.80 --> 01:40:05.80
Anyway.

1376
01:40:05.80 --> 01:40:06.80
So, luxury.

1377
01:40:06.80 --> 01:40:08.20
You called luxury items.

1378
01:40:08.20 --> 01:40:09.20
Get luxury.

1379
01:40:09.20 --> 01:40:10.20
Get luxury.

1380
01:40:10.20 --> 01:40:11.36
You'll go on here to talk about luxury.

1381
01:40:11.36 --> 01:40:12.84
Oh, just the concept of luxury.

1382
01:40:12.84 --> 01:40:13.84
Yeah, yeah.

1383
01:40:13.84 --> 01:40:14.84
luxury days.

1384
01:40:14.84 --> 01:40:16.92
Well, the sweats that they have are luxury.

1385
01:40:16.92 --> 01:40:18.24
And here's the thing, unprompted.

1386
01:40:18.24 --> 01:40:19.24
I go on Twitter.

1387
01:40:19.24 --> 01:40:21.36
And you know, you get people when they get their stuff.

1388
01:40:21.36 --> 01:40:23.84
They're like, hey, you know, you take a picture of your stuff.

1389
01:40:23.84 --> 01:40:24.84
Normal.

1390
01:40:24.84 --> 01:40:25.84
So, we go have a hoodie.

1391
01:40:25.84 --> 01:40:29.52
And he'll say, this is the softest hoodie I ever had.

1392
01:40:29.52 --> 01:40:30.52
That's the fact.

1393
01:40:30.52 --> 01:40:31.52
That is the fact.

1394
01:40:31.52 --> 01:40:32.52
Yeah.

1395
01:40:32.52 --> 01:40:33.88
That is the fact.

1396
01:40:33.88 --> 01:40:35.76
And then there's, I didn't understand this.

1397
01:40:35.76 --> 01:40:36.76
And then there's the joggers.

1398
01:40:36.76 --> 01:40:37.76
Yes.

1399
01:40:37.76 --> 01:40:41.44
I didn't understand why they're called joggers.

1400
01:40:41.44 --> 01:40:44.56
And what their purpose is.

1401
01:40:44.56 --> 01:40:47.64
Old school sweat pants.

1402
01:40:47.64 --> 01:40:49.40
They're just, they're as I can elastic.

1403
01:40:49.40 --> 01:40:50.56
They're like straight cut.

1404
01:40:50.56 --> 01:40:52.44
Then there's an elastic thing around the bottom.

1405
01:40:52.44 --> 01:40:55.04
And then they're just all baggy.

1406
01:40:55.04 --> 01:40:57.000
The purpose, apparently, did you tell me this?

1407
01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:59.36
That joggers are cut tighter.

1408
01:40:59.36 --> 01:41:01.68
And then they have like a tighter ankle.

1409
01:41:01.68 --> 01:41:03.96
So you can actually jog in the neck of the purpose.

1410
01:41:03.96 --> 01:41:04.96
Yes.

1411
01:41:04.96 --> 01:41:06.20
I didn't know that.

1412
01:41:06.20 --> 01:41:07.20
I had no idea.

1413
01:41:07.20 --> 01:41:08.20
Yeah.

1414
01:41:08.20 --> 01:41:09.92
So when you jog, they don't flap our un and the wind.

1415
01:41:09.92 --> 01:41:10.92
It's not just that.

1416
01:41:10.92 --> 01:41:11.92
It's a whole leg.

1417
01:41:11.92 --> 01:41:15.64
So the whole leg kind of, it hears to your, it's more like fitted to your leg.

1418
01:41:15.64 --> 01:41:17.000
And then they're more roomy in the hips.

1419
01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:21.04
So you can have like, you know, you can spray it to jog, you can run, same scene.

1420
01:41:21.04 --> 01:41:22.04
They just so happen.

1421
01:41:22.04 --> 01:41:28.40
And that mobility that it allows for running translates 110%.

1422
01:41:28.40 --> 01:41:29.40
To just cruising.

1423
01:41:29.40 --> 01:41:32.12
When you land on them, I'm telling you, 100%.

1424
01:41:32.12 --> 01:41:33.12
Pick it from me.

1425
01:41:33.12 --> 01:41:34.12
I know.

1426
01:41:34.12 --> 01:41:36.000
There's some supplements on there too.

1427
01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:37.80
We got some, we got some supplements.

1428
01:41:37.80 --> 01:41:39.000
There's a matter of fact.

1429
01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:40.000
Good stuff.

1430
01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:43.12
Joint warfare.

1431
01:41:43.12 --> 01:41:45.32
Number one best seller.

1432
01:41:45.32 --> 01:41:46.32
Joint warfare.

1433
01:41:46.32 --> 01:41:47.32
Right.

1434
01:41:47.32 --> 01:41:48.32
See why?

1435
01:41:48.32 --> 01:41:49.32
Yeah.

1436
01:41:49.32 --> 01:41:50.32
Crelloel.

1437
01:41:50.32 --> 01:41:51.32
Yeah.

1438
01:41:51.32 --> 01:41:52.32
What?

1439
01:41:52.32 --> 01:41:53.32
Okay.

1440
01:41:53.32 --> 01:41:53.32
So a lot of people ask this too.

1441
01:41:53.32 --> 01:41:57.16
And you told, okay, the difference in how the people, so a guy would be like,

1442
01:41:57.16 --> 01:41:59.20
hey, I work a physical job.

1443
01:41:59.20 --> 01:42:00.20
Mm-hmm.

1444
01:42:00.20 --> 01:42:01.20
Eight hours, 10 hours a day.

1445
01:42:01.20 --> 01:42:04.08
I want to do work out of wherever my joints take kind of a beating.

1446
01:42:04.08 --> 01:42:05.40
What should I take?

1447
01:42:05.40 --> 01:42:07.20
Joint warfare or cruel oil.

1448
01:42:07.20 --> 01:42:09.96
So people, they will wonder about that, which one should I take?

1449
01:42:09.96 --> 01:42:10.96
Because they're both for your joint.

1450
01:42:10.96 --> 01:42:11.96
Yeah.

1451
01:42:11.96 --> 01:42:13.84
And the straight up answer is yes, take both of them.

1452
01:42:13.84 --> 01:42:15.16
You should absolutely take both of them.

1453
01:42:15.16 --> 01:42:18.56
If you can only get one.

1454
01:42:18.56 --> 01:42:24.96
If you, I would say, if you're just feeling, what's the word?

1455
01:42:24.96 --> 01:42:31.12
Like if you have like legitimate, soreness, real legit soreness, I would go with

1456
01:42:31.12 --> 01:42:32.88
don't work for.

1457
01:42:32.88 --> 01:42:33.88
But I like cruel.

1458
01:42:33.88 --> 01:42:39.08
And I think it's, I've taken these things for so long together that I just, I don't

1459
01:42:39.08 --> 01:42:40.40
know, it's hard for me to answer that.

1460
01:42:40.40 --> 01:42:41.40
Yeah.

1461
01:42:41.40 --> 01:42:48.40
Well, Brian would tell me that, cruel oil is for just general, you know, man, you know,

1462
01:42:48.40 --> 01:42:49.40
you're getting this face it.

1463
01:42:49.40 --> 01:42:50.40
You're getting older.

1464
01:42:50.40 --> 01:42:52.40
And you know, you got a maintain.

1465
01:42:52.40 --> 01:42:53.40
You got a maintain.

1466
01:42:53.40 --> 01:42:54.40
It's not getting older.

1467
01:42:54.40 --> 01:42:55.40
Yeah.

1468
01:42:55.40 --> 01:42:56.40
I believe not.

1469
01:42:56.40 --> 01:42:57.40
Yeah.

1470
01:42:57.40 --> 01:42:58.40
And cruel oil together.

1471
01:42:58.40 --> 01:42:59.40
Yeah.

1472
01:42:59.40 --> 01:43:02.56
Like how you were saying, you know, your joints take a beating, like

1473
01:43:02.56 --> 01:43:06.24
actual beating, or they kind of hurt now, then yeah, joint warfare, because they help

1474
01:43:06.24 --> 01:43:07.24
inflammation.

1475
01:43:07.24 --> 01:43:08.24
Well, actually, the cruel oil take.

1476
01:43:08.24 --> 01:43:09.24
I got fired up today.

1477
01:43:09.24 --> 01:43:11.24
I did my workout.

1478
01:43:11.24 --> 01:43:13.08
I threw on the weight vest.

1479
01:43:13.08 --> 01:43:14.08
Oh, yeah.

1480
01:43:14.08 --> 01:43:17.24
And I just, I just pretended like I didn't have it on, but I had it on.

1481
01:43:17.24 --> 01:43:18.24
From my workout.

1482
01:43:18.24 --> 01:43:22.28
You know, that helps, you know, like that mental state to be like, so it's a difference

1483
01:43:22.28 --> 01:43:26.60
between like, like, you can lift in these different ways too.

1484
01:43:26.60 --> 01:43:29.32
But yeah, when you put weights on you, just like, you know, some people, they'll

1485
01:43:29.32 --> 01:43:32.52
say, I don't know, so I'm going to baseball about something, they'll put a weight on there,

1486
01:43:32.52 --> 01:43:33.52
or something like that.

1487
01:43:33.52 --> 01:43:37.000
And mentally, if you, basically, you're training your functionality with that, and that

1488
01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:39.32
resistance sort of just happens to be there.

1489
01:43:39.32 --> 01:43:42.16
So your brain just kind of accommodates, you know, so when you function without the

1490
01:43:42.16 --> 01:43:46.28
weight to just flying around, it's like, easiest, like, I weigh less now, you know, rather

1491
01:43:46.28 --> 01:43:47.28
than then.

1492
01:43:47.28 --> 01:43:50.80
Oh, I'm going to just eke out 10 reps of this very specific thing.

1493
01:43:50.80 --> 01:43:51.80
Then you're training your body.

1494
01:43:51.80 --> 01:43:52.80
Yeah, I kind of did this.

1495
01:43:52.80 --> 01:43:56.000
I kind of did this little like a mental debate, like, oh, well, you know, I feel like

1496
01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:58.20
I should, I should do something a little bit more.

1497
01:43:58.20 --> 01:44:00.52
Maybe I'll do some rounds with this, and then I'll take it.

1498
01:44:00.52 --> 01:44:03.36
And I'll just, no, I'm just going to do the whole thing like I just, and I did every

1499
01:44:03.36 --> 01:44:08.36
exercise, even just completely unrelated exercises with with a weight vest on.

1500
01:44:08.36 --> 01:44:09.36
Yeah, man, that's good.

1501
01:44:09.36 --> 01:44:13.000
I was doing box jumps the other day, which I actually don't do that much, but like,

1502
01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:16.84
idea, and I'll think, man, I think here's the morning on box jumps pay attention during

1503
01:44:16.84 --> 01:44:17.84
box jumps.

1504
01:44:17.84 --> 01:44:18.84
Oh, yeah.

1505
01:44:18.84 --> 01:44:21.76
It's really easy, especially when you get, when you get smoked, and you start just kind

1506
01:44:21.76 --> 01:44:23.32
of you're just going through the motions.

1507
01:44:23.32 --> 01:44:24.32
And that's when you miss.

1508
01:44:24.32 --> 01:44:25.32
Yeah.

1509
01:44:25.32 --> 01:44:26.32
When you miss the box jump, you get that shinner.

1510
01:44:26.32 --> 01:44:27.32
No fun.

1511
01:44:27.32 --> 01:44:30.92
Yeah, and yes, and that's what I was thinking too.

1512
01:44:30.92 --> 01:44:33.72
I was like, man, when I, because like, you know, this part of the mech, I was going back

1513
01:44:33.72 --> 01:44:34.72
and forth.

1514
01:44:34.72 --> 01:44:35.72
Yeah.

1515
01:44:35.72 --> 01:44:38.12
It's a long thing, but box jumps part of it.

1516
01:44:38.12 --> 01:44:42.44
And yes, towards those later rounds, I was like, okay, I better pay attention.

1517
01:44:42.44 --> 01:44:43.44
Good.

1518
01:44:43.44 --> 01:44:44.44
Yeah.

1519
01:44:44.44 --> 01:44:45.44
And I was doing, I was adding a little something.

1520
01:44:45.44 --> 01:44:49.80
You know, when you jump down, I went down into a little squat, then did the jump.

1521
01:44:49.80 --> 01:44:55.32
So it's not just the box, it's like down squat, but yes, and made me think like,

1522
01:44:55.32 --> 01:44:59.36
I could get a weight vest in really maximized these box jumps.

1523
01:44:59.36 --> 01:45:00.36
Yeah, pay attention.

1524
01:45:00.36 --> 01:45:01.36
Pay attention.

1525
01:45:01.36 --> 01:45:05.24
Takes a discipline beforehand too, by the way, which is a little pre-mission

1526
01:45:05.24 --> 01:45:06.52
get some.

1527
01:45:06.52 --> 01:45:16.84
And then if you need food, if you need nutrients for your body and for your mind, then

1528
01:45:16.84 --> 01:45:17.84
take mook.

1529
01:45:17.84 --> 01:45:18.84
Yeah.

1530
01:45:18.84 --> 01:45:22.80
Mook, tastes like, let's just, you know what I did yesterday?

1531
01:45:22.80 --> 01:45:23.80
Sure.

1532
01:45:23.80 --> 01:45:26.64
I took whipping cream.

1533
01:45:26.64 --> 01:45:27.64
Heavy whipping cream.

1534
01:45:27.64 --> 01:45:31.72
I think whipping cream, that you turn into whipped cream.

1535
01:45:31.72 --> 01:45:34.32
But normally, what you put in a non-make whipped cream?

1536
01:45:34.32 --> 01:45:35.32
Yes.

1537
01:45:35.32 --> 01:45:36.32
What did you do?

1538
01:45:36.32 --> 01:45:37.32
I don't know.

1539
01:45:37.32 --> 01:45:38.32
What else do you have to do?

1540
01:45:38.32 --> 01:45:39.32
I had an egg white in it.

1541
01:45:39.32 --> 01:45:40.32
No.

1542
01:45:40.32 --> 01:45:42.56
You got to add sugar.

1543
01:45:42.56 --> 01:45:49.20
So recently, I read this thing that one of the whipped cream companies came out with

1544
01:45:49.20 --> 01:45:53.84
like, Reese's Peanut Butter Whip Cream.

1545
01:45:53.84 --> 01:45:55.20
And some other kind of whipped cream.

1546
01:45:55.20 --> 01:45:57.36
So you get it in a spray can.

1547
01:45:57.36 --> 01:45:58.60
You press the little nozzle.

1548
01:45:58.60 --> 01:45:59.60
She worked.

1549
01:45:59.60 --> 01:46:00.60
Boom.

1550
01:46:00.60 --> 01:46:03.48
You got, Reese's Peanut Butter Flavor Whip Cream.

1551
01:46:03.48 --> 01:46:07.56
And I thought to myself, yep, that sounds good.

1552
01:46:07.56 --> 01:46:09.52
Boy, that's the freedom part.

1553
01:46:09.52 --> 01:46:11.60
So guess what I did?

1554
01:46:11.60 --> 01:46:15.68
I took heavy whipping cream that you make whipped cream with.

1555
01:46:15.68 --> 01:46:20.40
And I put peanut butter moch in it.

1556
01:46:20.40 --> 01:46:21.40
And I whipped it.

1557
01:46:21.40 --> 01:46:22.40
And guess what?

1558
01:46:22.40 --> 01:46:26.20
Well, it is good to go.

1559
01:46:26.20 --> 01:46:28.44
People like getting something tasty.

1560
01:46:28.44 --> 01:46:29.44
Tastyness.

1561
01:46:29.44 --> 01:46:30.44
Tastyness.

1562
01:46:30.44 --> 01:46:31.44
So yeah.

1563
01:46:31.44 --> 01:46:32.88
And all of them taste great.

1564
01:46:32.88 --> 01:46:35.04
All of them are awesome for you.

1565
01:46:35.04 --> 01:46:37.32
And we got mint peanut butter.

1566
01:46:37.32 --> 01:46:41.20
We got mint chocolate, peanut butter chocolate, vanilla gorilla.

1567
01:46:41.20 --> 01:46:43.68
And of course, the darkness chocolate.

1568
01:46:43.68 --> 01:46:47.68
And then warrior kid, warrior kid milk.

1569
01:46:47.68 --> 01:46:50.24
Of which look, they both taste delicious.

1570
01:46:50.24 --> 01:46:53.28
As a matter of fact, my son today, because it was getting cold.

1571
01:46:53.28 --> 01:46:56.16
And I hate saying that because we're in California.

1572
01:46:56.16 --> 01:46:57.40
Yeah, and cold.

1573
01:46:57.40 --> 01:46:58.40
This is not cold.

1574
01:46:58.40 --> 01:47:01.12
So everyone in Michigan, everyone peat the crew up and bathe.

1575
01:47:01.12 --> 01:47:02.40
I apologize.

1576
01:47:02.40 --> 01:47:06.92
Because it was getting cold this morning, which meant it was probably like 54.

1577
01:47:06.92 --> 01:47:07.92
Yeah.

1578
01:47:07.92 --> 01:47:08.92
Right?

1579
01:47:08.92 --> 01:47:12.04
Which out here in California in Southern California, it's like, oh, it was cold this

1580
01:47:12.04 --> 01:47:13.04
morning.

1581
01:47:13.04 --> 01:47:15.12
It was a little chilly this morning, a little nipping the air.

1582
01:47:15.12 --> 01:47:16.72
Of course, we're only wearing shorts in T-shirt.

1583
01:47:16.72 --> 01:47:22.12
So in Maine, I know peats up there wearing a parka.

1584
01:47:22.12 --> 01:47:27.52
But my son, he was jumping on his bike to go check the waves.

1585
01:47:27.52 --> 01:47:32.96
And he had a little, he had a little like a coffee, a tumbler, one of our tumblers.

1586
01:47:32.96 --> 01:47:33.96
And he doesn't drink coffee.

1587
01:47:33.96 --> 01:47:35.20
And I was like, what are you doing?

1588
01:47:35.20 --> 01:47:38.40
He goes, I made some hot cocoa milk.

1589
01:47:38.40 --> 01:47:40.68
And I said, let me dry it.

1590
01:47:40.68 --> 01:47:41.68
Wait, the warrior kid, let me dry it.

1591
01:47:41.68 --> 01:47:42.68
The warrior kid.

1592
01:47:42.68 --> 01:47:43.68
No, that was amazing.

1593
01:47:43.68 --> 01:47:44.68
It's just delicious.

1594
01:47:44.68 --> 01:47:45.68
It's just amazing.

1595
01:47:45.68 --> 01:47:46.68
It's like a cocoa.

1596
01:47:46.68 --> 01:47:47.68
Yeah, it's a cocoa.

1597
01:47:47.68 --> 01:47:48.68
Except, I guess what?

1598
01:47:48.68 --> 01:47:50.68
It's good for you and makes you strong.

1599
01:47:50.68 --> 01:47:51.68
Yeah.

1600
01:47:51.68 --> 01:47:52.68
What's up with that?

1601
01:47:52.68 --> 01:47:53.68
What's up with that?

1602
01:47:53.68 --> 01:47:55.68
So, yeah, that's the mole.

1603
01:47:55.68 --> 01:47:57.68
Anyways, strawberries delicious.

1604
01:47:57.68 --> 01:47:58.68
Get it for your kids.

1605
01:47:58.68 --> 01:48:02.68
In my house, it seems to be the only thing anyone in my house is eating right now.

1606
01:48:02.68 --> 01:48:05.68
So give that a shot and enjoy it.

1607
01:48:05.68 --> 01:48:07.68
You're going to be in that, I think you might be.

1608
01:48:07.68 --> 01:48:08.68
What's a parka?

1609
01:48:08.68 --> 01:48:09.68
A parka is the coat.

1610
01:48:09.68 --> 01:48:10.68
It's a big coat.

1611
01:48:10.68 --> 01:48:12.68
We've got a winter coat.

1612
01:48:12.68 --> 01:48:15.68
Yeah, you've ever seen a coat that has like a fur around the hood.

1613
01:48:15.68 --> 01:48:16.68
Yes.

1614
01:48:16.68 --> 01:48:19.68
It's sort of like the quintessential parka.

1615
01:48:19.68 --> 01:48:21.32
I think the things are kind of dope.

1616
01:48:21.32 --> 01:48:23.68
The word parka is kind of, kind of, if he.

1617
01:48:23.68 --> 01:48:24.68
I think you've talked about it.

1618
01:48:24.68 --> 01:48:25.68
I don't know.

1619
01:48:25.68 --> 01:48:26.68
I've never heard the word.

1620
01:48:26.68 --> 01:48:27.68
I'm saying, go.

1621
01:48:27.68 --> 01:48:28.68
I mean, refresh your use.

1622
01:48:28.68 --> 01:48:29.68
You're used to it.

1623
01:48:29.68 --> 01:48:30.68
Bro, you're from Hawaii.

1624
01:48:30.68 --> 01:48:31.68
I do know what a park is.

1625
01:48:31.68 --> 01:48:35.68
You do not even see snow until like three weeks ago or something.

1626
01:48:35.68 --> 01:48:38.68
No, for real, you didn't see snow until you were 30, right?

1627
01:48:38.68 --> 01:48:42.68
Technically, I saw snow on the big island when I was a little kid one time.

1628
01:48:42.68 --> 01:48:43.68
Yeah.

1629
01:48:43.68 --> 01:48:46.68
And you go up in Manakia and you can see snow.

1630
01:48:46.68 --> 01:48:48.68
We went up there with shorts and a tank top.

1631
01:48:48.68 --> 01:48:50.68
By the way, we just drove up there.

1632
01:48:50.68 --> 01:48:54.68
But since then, yes, I had not seen snow until I was 30.

1633
01:48:54.68 --> 01:48:55.68
Yeah.

1634
01:48:55.68 --> 01:48:58.68
So, you know, there's no possible way you're going to know what a park is.

1635
01:48:58.68 --> 01:48:59.68
Yeah.

1636
01:48:59.68 --> 01:49:00.68
So, yeah.

1637
01:49:00.68 --> 01:49:03.68
So, which kind of is part of my point where if you've never really, I mean, I've heard the word parka,

1638
01:49:03.68 --> 01:49:07.68
but I'm not used to what kind of entails and what the goodness of that.

1639
01:49:07.68 --> 01:49:10.68
So, I'm just left with the word parka.

1640
01:49:10.68 --> 01:49:16.68
And a park is as far as just the word doesn't seem like, I don't know, seems like a funny word.

1641
01:49:16.68 --> 01:49:19.68
Well, put some context around it.

1642
01:49:19.68 --> 01:49:20.68
Yeah.

1643
01:49:20.68 --> 01:49:21.68
Freezing cold people, give them a parka.

1644
01:49:21.68 --> 01:49:23.68
Nice, a little warm, functional parka.

1645
01:49:23.68 --> 01:49:24.68
Yeah.

1646
01:49:24.68 --> 01:49:25.68
Yeah.

1647
01:49:25.68 --> 01:49:26.68
Yep.

1648
01:49:26.68 --> 01:49:27.68
Man, I dig it.

1649
01:49:27.68 --> 01:49:29.68
See, growing, you know, growth.

1650
01:49:29.68 --> 01:49:30.68
We call that growth.

1651
01:49:30.68 --> 01:49:31.68
I'm growing here.

1652
01:49:31.68 --> 01:49:33.68
Trying to speak in a growth.

1653
01:49:33.68 --> 01:49:35.68
You understand the path and represent at the same time.

1654
01:49:35.68 --> 01:49:37.68
Grow in that way.

1655
01:49:37.68 --> 01:49:38.68
Go to jocquistord.com.

1656
01:49:38.68 --> 01:49:39.68
That's right.

1657
01:49:39.68 --> 01:49:40.68
Jocquist is stored.

1658
01:49:40.68 --> 01:49:43.68
So, you can get your discipline equals freedom shirts.

1659
01:49:43.68 --> 01:49:46.68
Women tank tops, by the way.

1660
01:49:46.68 --> 01:49:47.68
Mm-hmm.

1661
01:49:47.68 --> 01:49:48.68
Work on men tank tops.

1662
01:49:48.68 --> 01:49:49.68
Men's tank tops.

1663
01:49:49.68 --> 01:49:51.68
I know the temperature is dropping.

1664
01:49:51.68 --> 01:49:52.68
I'm not going to say it's cold here.

1665
01:49:52.68 --> 01:49:53.68
I'm not going to say it.

1666
01:49:53.68 --> 01:49:56.68
The temperature is lowering.

1667
01:49:56.68 --> 01:49:57.68
You know?

1668
01:49:57.68 --> 01:49:59.68
So, I dig it if you're not going to wear the tank top all the time.

1669
01:49:59.68 --> 01:50:00.68
I dig it.

1670
01:50:00.68 --> 01:50:02.68
But they're on there nonetheless.

1671
01:50:02.68 --> 01:50:03.68
Uh, some hoodies.

1672
01:50:03.68 --> 01:50:04.68
Mm-hmm.

1673
01:50:04.68 --> 01:50:08.68
Either they're out now or they will be within one week from right now.

1674
01:50:08.68 --> 01:50:09.68
T-shirts?

1675
01:50:09.68 --> 01:50:10.68
T-shirts?

1676
01:50:10.68 --> 01:50:11.68
T-shirts?

1677
01:50:11.68 --> 01:50:12.68
How about that?

1678
01:50:12.68 --> 01:50:13.68
Defkortissia.

1679
01:50:13.68 --> 01:50:14.68
Oh, yeah.

1680
01:50:14.68 --> 01:50:16.68
See, you're a group of people in the deaf culture.

1681
01:50:16.68 --> 01:50:17.68
Right now.

1682
01:50:17.68 --> 01:50:19.68
That's good, because it's a...

1683
01:50:19.68 --> 01:50:23.68
I talked about, like, for me,

1684
01:50:23.68 --> 01:50:28.68
to make a statement with what you're wearing is kind of just a little bit.

1685
01:50:28.68 --> 01:50:29.68
I don't like that.

1686
01:50:29.68 --> 01:50:30.68
It's too much.

1687
01:50:30.68 --> 01:50:31.68
I'm not dressing to make a statement.

1688
01:50:31.68 --> 01:50:32.68
It's my point.

1689
01:50:32.68 --> 01:50:33.68
Yeah.

1690
01:50:33.68 --> 01:50:34.68
I don't think all.

1691
01:50:34.68 --> 01:50:35.68
I'm not dressing to make a statement.

1692
01:50:35.68 --> 01:50:37.68
I wear the functionality is primary.

1693
01:50:37.68 --> 01:50:38.68
Sure.

1694
01:50:38.68 --> 01:50:41.68
So, I don't know if I thought this shirt is functional.

1695
01:50:41.68 --> 01:50:42.68
Right.

1696
01:50:42.68 --> 01:50:43.68
It is functional.

1697
01:50:43.68 --> 01:50:44.68
It makes a subtle statement.

1698
01:50:44.68 --> 01:50:45.68
I must admit.

1699
01:50:45.68 --> 01:50:48.68
Well, even not making a statement is making a statement.

1700
01:50:48.68 --> 01:50:49.68
It's kind of like...

1701
01:50:49.68 --> 01:50:50.68
Let's really...

1702
01:50:50.68 --> 01:50:51.68
Well, yeah, well, no way.

1703
01:50:51.68 --> 01:50:52.68
You give you try too hard to not make a statement.

1704
01:50:52.68 --> 01:50:53.68
And that's just...

1705
01:50:53.68 --> 01:50:54.68
Yeah, yeah.

1706
01:50:54.68 --> 01:50:54.68
Then your...

1707
01:50:54.68 --> 01:50:55.68
The bigger's defeating it.

1708
01:50:55.68 --> 01:50:56.68
Yeah, defeating the purpose.

1709
01:50:56.68 --> 01:50:58.68
That's why this shirt...

1710
01:50:58.68 --> 01:50:59.68
Settle.

1711
01:50:59.68 --> 01:51:01.68
Statement made, mostly to yourself.

1712
01:51:01.68 --> 01:51:03.68
There's not a statement to the world because people just look at this.

1713
01:51:03.68 --> 01:51:04.68
We're not even think twice about it.

1714
01:51:04.68 --> 01:51:06.68
Maybe they think one more time about it.

1715
01:51:06.68 --> 01:51:07.68
Think what is that?

1716
01:51:07.68 --> 01:51:08.68
Yeah.

1717
01:51:08.68 --> 01:51:12.68
Well, if you're watching this on YouTube, they're going to notice that you're not wearing the victory.

1718
01:51:12.68 --> 01:51:13.68
It's not going to be huge statement.

1719
01:51:13.68 --> 01:51:17.68
And that's going to actually maybe even throw some people for a little loop.

1720
01:51:17.68 --> 01:51:18.68
And...

1721
01:51:18.68 --> 01:51:22.68
Nonetheless, yes, all on JoccoStore.com.

1722
01:51:22.68 --> 01:51:24.68
Some cool rashguards on there as well.

1723
01:51:24.68 --> 01:51:26.68
Some get out a little bit more.

1724
01:51:26.68 --> 01:51:27.68
How should I say?

1725
01:51:27.68 --> 01:51:30.68
Geared towards the specific path.

1726
01:51:30.68 --> 01:51:31.68
I've got to get enough there.

1727
01:51:31.68 --> 01:51:32.68
From the...

1728
01:51:32.68 --> 01:51:35.68
There's technically one that literally says...

1729
01:51:35.68 --> 01:51:36.68
Get after it.

1730
01:51:36.68 --> 01:51:37.68
So I guess that's point.

1731
01:51:37.68 --> 01:51:38.68
On point.

1732
01:51:38.68 --> 01:51:40.68
Hey, subscribe to the podcast if you don't.

1733
01:51:40.68 --> 01:51:42.68
iTunes Google Play Stitcher.

1734
01:51:42.68 --> 01:51:48.68
Leave reviews so that we can read them and get a good laugh from the crazy things that you say.

1735
01:51:48.68 --> 01:51:49.68
Thank you.

1736
01:51:49.68 --> 01:51:51.68
Also, the Warrior Kid podcast.

1737
01:51:51.68 --> 01:51:53.68
We just put out a new one.

1738
01:51:53.68 --> 01:51:57.68
I apologize that they come a little bit further apart than these.

1739
01:51:57.68 --> 01:52:05.68
I've gotten many people that have said they have been listening to the first 18 Warrior Kid podcast over and over and over again.

1740
01:52:05.68 --> 01:52:07.68
So I've got the literally lessons.

1741
01:52:07.68 --> 01:52:10.68
And I appreciate the feedback on those.

1742
01:52:10.68 --> 01:52:15.68
Also, you can go and don't forget your Warrior Kid soap from IrishOxRange.com.

1743
01:52:15.68 --> 01:52:16.68
Young by...

1744
01:52:16.68 --> 01:52:20.68
Made by Young Warrior Kid Aiden, who's making...

1745
01:52:20.68 --> 01:52:22.68
JoccoSope.

1746
01:52:22.68 --> 01:52:25.68
And his advice, which I totally agree with,

1747
01:52:25.68 --> 01:52:28.68
is get some soap so you can stay clean.

1748
01:52:28.68 --> 01:52:29.68
F*** it.

1749
01:52:29.68 --> 01:52:30.68
YouTube.

1750
01:52:30.68 --> 01:52:32.68
Don't forget about YouTube.

1751
01:52:32.68 --> 01:52:34.68
Subscribe to the YouTube channel.

1752
01:52:34.68 --> 01:52:37.68
So you can see echoes, legit videos.

1753
01:52:37.68 --> 01:52:38.68
You can see if we have guests on.

1754
01:52:38.68 --> 01:52:43.68
You can see who they are, what they look like, how they react, all that stuff.

1755
01:52:43.68 --> 01:52:44.68
You can get a feel for...

1756
01:52:44.68 --> 01:52:45.68
You can get to see what...

1757
01:52:45.68 --> 01:52:49.68
If you don't know what echo looks like, he doesn't look like what he sounds like.

1758
01:52:49.68 --> 01:52:51.68
So we've been told.

1759
01:52:51.68 --> 01:52:52.68
Yeah.

1760
01:52:52.68 --> 01:52:53.68
So you can see what echo looks like.

1761
01:52:53.68 --> 01:52:56.68
And then you can put a comment that says...

1762
01:52:56.68 --> 01:53:01.68
It can say, for instance, echo look in Jack.

1763
01:53:01.68 --> 01:53:03.68
Sure?

1764
01:53:03.68 --> 01:53:04.68
Or...

1765
01:53:04.68 --> 01:53:06.68
Damn echoes, yoke.

1766
01:53:06.68 --> 01:53:07.68
Or whatever.

1767
01:53:07.68 --> 01:53:09.68
So there's a lot of those comments that make it on there.

1768
01:53:09.68 --> 01:53:10.68
And I know that...

1769
01:53:10.68 --> 01:53:14.68
That's basically the form of compensation that echo gets for his work.

1770
01:53:14.68 --> 01:53:17.68
These people, sadly, people in YouTube comment saying,

1771
01:53:17.68 --> 01:53:20.68
Echo's got Jack guns.

1772
01:53:20.68 --> 01:53:25.68
So if you want to pay echo Charles, if you want to pay echo Charles,

1773
01:53:25.68 --> 01:53:27.68
there's no Patreon account.

1774
01:53:27.68 --> 01:53:29.68
There's no GoFundMe.

1775
01:53:29.68 --> 01:53:31.68
You just go on to YouTube comments.

1776
01:53:31.68 --> 01:53:34.68
And you write echo look in Jack, boy.

1777
01:53:34.68 --> 01:53:39.68
Oh, so there you go.

1778
01:53:39.68 --> 01:53:41.68
I've never covered.

1779
01:53:41.68 --> 01:53:44.68
Also, psychological warfare.

1780
01:53:44.68 --> 01:53:47.68
That's an album with tracks that we made,

1781
01:53:47.68 --> 01:53:50.68
and I'm going to talk about the way I'm talking about.

1782
01:53:50.68 --> 01:53:55.68
By the way, telling you how to get past through, get through, power through.

1783
01:53:55.68 --> 01:53:58.68
Those moments of weakness when they arise.

1784
01:53:58.68 --> 01:53:59.68
Which they do sometimes, by the way.

1785
01:53:59.68 --> 01:54:00.68
I know you don't know this.

1786
01:54:00.68 --> 01:54:03.68
Actually, you didn't know this, but they do arise.

1787
01:54:03.68 --> 01:54:05.68
But if Joc was there telling you how to get through it,

1788
01:54:05.68 --> 01:54:07.68
pragmatically, by the way.

1789
01:54:07.68 --> 01:54:08.68
You'll get through it.

1790
01:54:08.68 --> 01:54:10.68
I found that to be a fact.

1791
01:54:10.68 --> 01:54:12.68
100% of the time.

1792
01:54:12.68 --> 01:54:14.68
Also, while you're doing your workout,

1793
01:54:14.68 --> 01:54:17.68
you're going to go to onit.com slash jockel.

1794
01:54:17.68 --> 01:54:20.68
And get new kettlebells.

1795
01:54:20.68 --> 01:54:23.68
So I did totally revives your whole workout.

1796
01:54:23.68 --> 01:54:24.68
In fact, do this.

1797
01:54:24.68 --> 01:54:25.68
Do your normal workout.

1798
01:54:25.68 --> 01:54:27.68
If in fact, you doesn't have kettlebells in the workout.

1799
01:54:27.68 --> 01:54:28.68
Do your normal workout.

1800
01:54:28.68 --> 01:54:29.68
And do a kettlebell.

1801
01:54:29.68 --> 01:54:31.68
Like maybe like a five or ten minute one.

1802
01:54:31.68 --> 01:54:34.68
Yeah, my son was asking me about working out.

1803
01:54:34.68 --> 01:54:38.68
And he was kind of like, well, I just want to get like,

1804
01:54:38.68 --> 01:54:41.68
like, like, what big muscles?

1805
01:54:41.68 --> 01:54:43.68
Just get strong.

1806
01:54:43.68 --> 01:54:48.68
And he can do the, or has done the kettlebell snatch.

1807
01:54:48.68 --> 01:54:52.68
But I was like up the way a little bit and throw that thing up there.

1808
01:54:52.68 --> 01:54:55.68
And I go every time you have to stop that thing in the top position,

1809
01:54:55.68 --> 01:54:58.68
it's your whole body has to kind of put some effort into it.

1810
01:54:58.68 --> 01:55:01.68
You will have, if you haven't done it before.

1811
01:55:01.68 --> 01:55:04.68
And you go a little bit heavier than like what you,

1812
01:55:04.68 --> 01:55:06.68
which I don't, you know, could be careful.

1813
01:55:06.68 --> 01:55:07.68
But I'll blah, blah, blah, whatever.

1814
01:55:07.68 --> 01:55:08.68
Okay.

1815
01:55:08.68 --> 01:55:11.68
So if you go a little bit heavier, you will have like sore abs.

1816
01:55:11.68 --> 01:55:13.68
You're abs will be sore.

1817
01:55:13.68 --> 01:55:15.68
So you're post your your chain.

1818
01:55:15.68 --> 01:55:16.68
Sure.

1819
01:55:16.68 --> 01:55:17.68
Will be.

1820
01:55:17.68 --> 01:55:18.68
Yeah, that's a real thing.

1821
01:55:18.68 --> 01:55:19.68
I know it's a pro.

1822
01:55:19.68 --> 01:55:21.68
You're post your your chain because there's people like,

1823
01:55:21.68 --> 01:55:22.68
what do you want to do?

1824
01:55:22.68 --> 01:55:23.68
No, so you're post your,

1825
01:55:23.68 --> 01:55:25.68
tear your chain will be,

1826
01:55:25.68 --> 01:55:27.68
get work, but believe it or not,

1827
01:55:27.68 --> 01:55:29.68
your front and tear your,

1828
01:55:29.68 --> 01:55:32.68
your and tear your chain will get work too because it has to,

1829
01:55:32.68 --> 01:55:33.68
arrest.

1830
01:55:33.68 --> 01:55:34.68
Yes.

1831
01:55:34.68 --> 01:55:37.68
That weight, which is flying up there and then asked to stop,

1832
01:55:37.68 --> 01:55:38.68
otherwise it ripped your shoulder out,

1833
01:55:38.68 --> 01:55:39.68
which is why I should be careful.

1834
01:55:39.68 --> 01:55:40.68
Don't go too heavy.

1835
01:55:40.68 --> 01:55:43.68
But it's, and so my, you know, my bicycle is,

1836
01:55:43.68 --> 01:55:44.68
it's killing.

1837
01:55:44.68 --> 01:55:45.68
It's almost there man,

1838
01:55:45.68 --> 01:55:46.68
or almost there.

1839
01:55:46.68 --> 01:55:48.68
But one of the things I could straight up,

1840
01:55:48.68 --> 01:55:53.68
not even start doing until very recently is kettlebells on that side.

1841
01:55:53.68 --> 01:55:54.68
You know, because it slaps around.

1842
01:55:54.68 --> 01:55:55.68
Yeah.

1843
01:55:55.68 --> 01:55:58.68
It twist it, twist your wrist in this way that it really,

1844
01:55:58.68 --> 01:56:01.68
it puts, so I even want to go on a light one.

1845
01:56:01.68 --> 01:56:03.68
And it's weird because the pain is less there,

1846
01:56:03.68 --> 01:56:05.68
more so than just kind of the raw,

1847
01:56:05.68 --> 01:56:10.68
newness of my arm going through that whole kettlebell procedure.

1848
01:56:10.68 --> 01:56:14.68
So I'm saying, so like, you know, when the thing comes up to a rest right here on your wrist,

1849
01:56:14.68 --> 01:56:16.68
just it's sitting there on your wrist.

1850
01:56:16.68 --> 01:56:18.68
It has to rest there and your wrist,

1851
01:56:18.68 --> 01:56:19.68
your wrist is twisted in a certain way.

1852
01:56:19.68 --> 01:56:21.68
You know, it's cool to normal if you don't,

1853
01:56:21.68 --> 01:56:25.68
but man, it's weird the difference of my right hand,

1854
01:56:25.68 --> 01:56:26.68
my good hand and my bad hand.

1855
01:56:26.68 --> 01:56:28.68
Just the thing resting on the thing is like,

1856
01:56:28.68 --> 01:56:30.68
you know, like, giving.

1857
01:56:30.68 --> 01:56:32.68
So you lack the conditioning.

1858
01:56:32.68 --> 01:56:33.68
Yeah, but conditioning is faded.

1859
01:56:33.68 --> 01:56:34.68
Just in your little,

1860
01:56:34.68 --> 01:56:36.68
just in your little pressure in the,

1861
01:56:36.68 --> 01:56:37.68
yeah, yeah, yeah, toughness.

1862
01:56:37.68 --> 01:56:38.68
The toughness.

1863
01:56:38.68 --> 01:56:39.68
The toughness.

1864
01:56:39.68 --> 01:56:41.68
I felt that the other day when we were rolling.

1865
01:56:41.68 --> 01:56:43.68
Oh, that my toughness.

1866
01:56:43.68 --> 01:56:45.68
Yeah, just like a, a dissension of toughness.

1867
01:56:45.68 --> 01:56:48.68
Yeah, yeah, no, no, no, no, didn't see us.

1868
01:56:48.68 --> 01:56:51.68
I was just, I was taking it light, you know, same thing.

1869
01:56:51.68 --> 01:56:54.68
You're really happy with that.

1870
01:56:54.68 --> 01:56:58.68
I'm just saying, I don't forget about Jockel White T.

1871
01:56:58.68 --> 01:57:02.68
It is certified as the only beverage,

1872
01:57:02.68 --> 01:57:05.68
whether you get it in the can or you get it in the bag,

1873
01:57:05.68 --> 01:57:07.68
and you steep it yourself.

1874
01:57:07.68 --> 01:57:10.68
Either way, it is the only beverage in the world

1875
01:57:10.68 --> 01:57:15.68
that comes with a 100% money back guarantee of an 8,000 pound deadlift.

1876
01:57:15.68 --> 01:57:16.68
Good.

1877
01:57:16.68 --> 01:57:17.68
Which is really good.

1878
01:57:17.68 --> 01:57:19.68
And it's organic, by the way.

1879
01:57:19.68 --> 01:57:21.68
It's organic on top of that.

1880
01:57:21.68 --> 01:57:23.68
It's something so tasty.

1881
01:57:23.68 --> 01:57:26.68
And as the winter arrives,

1882
01:57:26.68 --> 01:57:28.68
and it gets really cold.

1883
01:57:28.68 --> 01:57:30.68
I am California, sorry.

1884
01:57:30.68 --> 01:57:33.68
Yeah, my people of the north.

1885
01:57:33.68 --> 01:57:36.68
To get that warm tea going, just put a couple bags.

1886
01:57:36.68 --> 01:57:38.68
Now, some people worry about how long you should steep,

1887
01:57:38.68 --> 01:57:40.68
do you know what steep the tea means?

1888
01:57:40.68 --> 01:57:41.68
I do know, yeah.

1889
01:57:41.68 --> 01:57:42.68
Okay, yeah.

1890
01:57:42.68 --> 01:57:44.68
So how long should you steep the tea?

1891
01:57:44.68 --> 01:57:46.68
In my opinion, when I put a tea bag in,

1892
01:57:46.68 --> 01:57:47.68
it's not coming out.

1893
01:57:47.68 --> 01:57:48.68
Oh, straight out.

1894
01:57:48.68 --> 01:57:49.68
I just leave it in there.

1895
01:57:49.68 --> 01:57:51.68
I'm just going to, I'm going to leave it in there.

1896
01:57:51.68 --> 01:57:53.68
It's good to go to drink and you know, like a couple,

1897
01:57:53.68 --> 01:57:55.68
like a minute, or maybe two minutes.

1898
01:57:55.68 --> 01:57:57.68
But then I'm not taking that tea bag.

1899
01:57:57.68 --> 01:57:59.68
I'm going to get all that, all that,

1900
01:57:59.68 --> 01:58:01.68
all that pomegranate goodness, all that,

1901
01:58:01.68 --> 01:58:05.68
all those antioxidants are coming right into my system.

1902
01:58:05.68 --> 01:58:06.68
So I'll let you know.

1903
01:58:06.68 --> 01:58:08.68
And it tastes delicious,

1904
01:58:08.68 --> 01:58:10.68
and it does have caffeine in it.

1905
01:58:10.68 --> 01:58:12.68
I will say.

1906
01:58:12.68 --> 01:58:17.68
So the cans have 60 milligrams, depending on how long you steep.

1907
01:58:17.68 --> 01:58:19.68
And I think when you steep it like I do,

1908
01:58:19.68 --> 01:58:21.68
there's probably a little bit extra,

1909
01:58:21.68 --> 01:58:22.68
a little bit of extra.

1910
01:58:22.68 --> 01:58:23.68
Get some.

1911
01:58:23.68 --> 01:58:24.68
Sure.

1912
01:58:24.68 --> 01:58:25.68
Inside there.

1913
01:58:25.68 --> 01:58:26.68
Steak is there.

1914
01:58:26.68 --> 01:58:27.68
Also got some books.

1915
01:58:27.68 --> 01:58:28.68
Okay, where the warrior kid?

1916
01:58:28.68 --> 01:58:30.68
And Mark's mission.

1917
01:58:30.68 --> 01:58:32.68
Those are two kids books,

1918
01:58:32.68 --> 01:58:37.68
but I promise you that Uncle Jake has lessons for everyone.

1919
01:58:37.68 --> 01:58:38.68
Yeah.

1920
01:58:38.68 --> 01:58:38.68
Agreed.

1921
01:58:38.68 --> 01:58:40.68
And I'm one of those people.

1922
01:58:40.68 --> 01:58:43.68
And so I think when you read that to your kids,

1923
01:58:43.68 --> 01:58:44.68
oh well, in my case,

1924
01:58:44.68 --> 01:58:47.68
because I thought I can't quite read a book.

1925
01:58:47.68 --> 01:58:48.68
Yeah.

1926
01:58:48.68 --> 01:58:49.68
So I'll read it,

1927
01:58:49.68 --> 01:58:51.68
but I feel like I'm reading to myself too.

1928
01:58:51.68 --> 01:58:52.68
Like these are all things that I,

1929
01:58:52.68 --> 01:58:53.68
some that you forget.

1930
01:58:53.68 --> 01:58:54.68
I think as an adult,

1931
01:58:54.68 --> 01:58:55.68
you forget a lot of these lessons.

1932
01:58:55.68 --> 01:58:57.68
You know, because now you have a routine.

1933
01:58:57.68 --> 01:58:58.68
As an adult,

1934
01:58:58.68 --> 01:58:59.68
you have a routine.

1935
01:58:59.68 --> 01:59:00.68
Some of these lessons.

1936
01:59:00.68 --> 01:59:02.68
It feels like they don't apply it first, you know?

1937
01:59:02.68 --> 01:59:04.68
So you kind of forget them and you're not.

1938
01:59:04.68 --> 01:59:06.68
Man, I wish I could just incorporate that little thing.

1939
01:59:06.68 --> 01:59:11.68
One of the fundamental laws of combat is simple.

1940
01:59:11.68 --> 01:59:12.68
Yeah.

1941
01:59:12.68 --> 01:59:15.68
And way the warrior kid is the,

1942
01:59:15.68 --> 01:59:17.68
it's life rules.

1943
01:59:17.68 --> 01:59:18.68
But fourth,

1944
01:59:18.68 --> 01:59:21.68
in a very simple way that a young child could,

1945
01:59:21.68 --> 01:59:22.68
understand them.

1946
01:59:22.68 --> 01:59:25.68
But what surprising is in that simplicity,

1947
01:59:25.68 --> 01:59:27.68
it hits anyone,

1948
01:59:27.68 --> 01:59:32.68
solidly right between the eyes.

1949
01:59:32.68 --> 01:59:36.68
So that's way the warrior kid and Mark's mission.

1950
01:59:36.68 --> 01:59:38.68
You can get those.

1951
01:59:38.68 --> 01:59:39.68
Also about the discipline equals freedom,

1952
01:59:39.68 --> 01:59:40.68
field manual.

1953
01:59:40.68 --> 01:59:41.68
That's another one that if you,

1954
01:59:41.68 --> 01:59:43.68
if you re, or if you refer to,

1955
01:59:43.68 --> 01:59:44.68
it'll like remind you,

1956
01:59:44.68 --> 01:59:45.68
because like,

1957
01:59:45.68 --> 01:59:46.68
okay, so,

1958
01:59:46.68 --> 01:59:47.68
man,

1959
01:59:47.68 --> 01:59:48.68
I don't meditate.

1960
01:59:48.68 --> 01:59:49.68
I don't.

1961
01:59:49.68 --> 01:59:50.68
Like, you know, like,

1962
01:59:50.68 --> 01:59:51.68
for like,

1963
01:59:51.68 --> 01:59:52.68
okay,

1964
01:59:52.68 --> 01:59:53.68
it's arguably,

1965
01:59:53.68 --> 01:59:54.68
it's meditation.

1966
01:59:54.68 --> 01:59:55.68
It's not, it's not,

1967
01:59:55.68 --> 01:59:56.68
it's not meditation.

1968
01:59:56.68 --> 01:59:57.68
You know what,

1969
01:59:57.68 --> 01:59:58.68
they're talking about.

1970
01:59:58.68 --> 01:59:59.68
So,

1971
01:59:59.68 --> 02:00:02.68
from what I understand,

1972
02:00:02.68 --> 02:00:04.68
if you meditate on certain things,

1973
02:00:04.68 --> 02:00:07.68
they help like incorporate it into your,

1974
02:00:07.68 --> 02:00:07.68
you know,

1975
02:00:07.68 --> 02:00:09.68
your whole normal thought meditate,

1976
02:00:09.68 --> 02:00:10.68
whatever.

1977
02:00:10.68 --> 02:00:13.68
That's what I would start with,

1978
02:00:13.68 --> 02:00:14.68
finally.

1979
02:00:14.68 --> 02:00:15.68
But,

1980
02:00:15.68 --> 02:00:16.68
and then you would need,

1981
02:00:16.68 --> 02:00:17.68
and this is just my,

1982
02:00:17.68 --> 02:00:19.68
my thought about meditation,

1983
02:00:19.68 --> 02:00:22.68
you would need less reminders of certain things,

1984
02:00:22.68 --> 02:00:23.68
you know,

1985
02:00:23.68 --> 02:00:23.68
like,

1986
02:00:23.68 --> 02:00:24.68
yes.

1987
02:00:24.68 --> 02:00:24.68
How to,

1988
02:00:24.68 --> 02:00:25.68
like,

1989
02:00:25.68 --> 02:00:25.68
like,

1990
02:00:25.68 --> 02:00:26.68
detach is,

1991
02:00:26.68 --> 02:00:27.68
for whatever reason,

1992
02:00:27.68 --> 02:00:28.68
what I understood,

1993
02:00:28.68 --> 02:00:28.68
the,

1994
02:00:28.68 --> 02:00:30.68
the concept of detach,

1995
02:00:30.68 --> 02:00:31.68
and the importance of it.

1996
02:00:31.68 --> 02:00:32.68
That's,

1997
02:00:32.68 --> 02:00:32.68
that's to me,

1998
02:00:32.68 --> 02:00:35.68
just kind of established itself as like,

1999
02:00:35.68 --> 02:00:35.68
pre,

2000
02:00:35.68 --> 02:00:37.68
one of the most important things

2001
02:00:37.68 --> 02:00:39.68
that you can roll into your life,

2002
02:00:39.68 --> 02:00:40.68
that'll improve it right away.

2003
02:00:40.68 --> 02:00:41.68
That's like,

2004
02:00:41.68 --> 02:00:42.68
right then in there.

2005
02:00:42.68 --> 02:00:43.68
But,

2006
02:00:43.68 --> 02:00:43.68
the thing,

2007
02:00:43.68 --> 02:00:44.68
just like,

2008
02:00:44.68 --> 02:00:45.68
you said,

2009
02:00:45.68 --> 02:00:47.68
you got to notice when you got to detach,

2010
02:00:47.68 --> 02:00:48.68
you know,

2011
02:00:48.68 --> 02:00:49.68
it's not detached into the heart part.

2012
02:00:49.68 --> 02:00:50.68
It's to notice,

2013
02:00:50.68 --> 02:00:51.68
you know,

2014
02:00:51.68 --> 02:00:52.68
it's time to go and,

2015
02:00:52.68 --> 02:00:53.68
so for like a better term,

2016
02:00:53.68 --> 02:00:55.68
you're forgetting to detach right now,

2017
02:00:55.68 --> 02:00:56.68
because you're so distracted by all the feelings,

2018
02:00:56.68 --> 02:00:57.68
whatever.

2019
02:00:57.68 --> 02:00:58.68
So it's one of the,

2020
02:00:58.68 --> 02:01:00.68
so the feel menu is like a really good one.

2021
02:01:00.68 --> 02:01:01.68
So like,

2022
02:01:01.68 --> 02:01:01.68
man,

2023
02:01:01.68 --> 02:01:02.68
if you can refer to that boom,

2024
02:01:02.68 --> 02:01:04.68
and this goes for all the subjects in there,

2025
02:01:04.68 --> 02:01:04.68
by the way,

2026
02:01:04.68 --> 02:01:05.68
like so like every day,

2027
02:01:05.68 --> 02:01:06.68
even every other day,

2028
02:01:06.68 --> 02:01:07.68
two,

2029
02:01:07.68 --> 02:01:07.68
three days,

2030
02:01:07.68 --> 02:01:08.68
whatever,

2031
02:01:08.68 --> 02:01:09.68
just refer back to it,

2032
02:01:09.68 --> 02:01:09.68
man,

2033
02:01:09.68 --> 02:01:10.68
it helps.

2034
02:01:10.68 --> 02:01:11.68
It keeps it on your mind,

2035
02:01:11.68 --> 02:01:12.68
all these things.

2036
02:01:12.68 --> 02:01:12.68
Yeah.

2037
02:01:12.68 --> 02:01:13.68
It only does.

2038
02:01:13.68 --> 02:01:15.68
People post pictures of,

2039
02:01:15.68 --> 02:01:16.68
the feel manual.

2040
02:01:16.68 --> 02:01:17.68
Yeah.

2041
02:01:17.68 --> 02:01:17.68
Like one,

2042
02:01:17.68 --> 02:01:18.68
like one page,

2043
02:01:18.68 --> 02:01:19.68
two pages of it.

2044
02:01:19.68 --> 02:01:21.68
And when I,

2045
02:01:21.68 --> 02:01:22.68
whenever I,

2046
02:01:22.68 --> 02:01:23.68
when someone posts a picture of that,

2047
02:01:23.68 --> 02:01:24.68
I actually read,

2048
02:01:24.68 --> 02:01:25.68
I wrote the book,

2049
02:01:25.68 --> 02:01:27.68
but I still read this section and say like,

2050
02:01:27.68 --> 02:01:28.68
and it,

2051
02:01:28.68 --> 02:01:29.68
and I don't read it and go,

2052
02:01:29.68 --> 02:01:30.68
oh,

2053
02:01:30.68 --> 02:01:30.68
oh,

2054
02:01:30.68 --> 02:01:31.68
I remember writing that.

2055
02:01:31.68 --> 02:01:31.68
I actually go,

2056
02:01:31.68 --> 02:01:32.68
I can do that better.

2057
02:01:32.68 --> 02:01:33.68
Yeah.

2058
02:01:33.68 --> 02:01:34.68
I want to do that.

2059
02:01:34.68 --> 02:01:35.68
I need to focus,

2060
02:01:35.68 --> 02:01:36.68
you know what I mean?

2061
02:01:36.68 --> 02:01:36.68
Yeah.

2062
02:01:36.68 --> 02:01:37.68
And you said good thing about that,

2063
02:01:37.68 --> 02:01:38.68
where overwhelmed,

2064
02:01:38.68 --> 02:01:39.68
right?

2065
02:01:39.68 --> 02:01:40.68
That was one that,

2066
02:01:40.68 --> 02:01:42.68
I don't even know who posted it first,

2067
02:01:42.68 --> 02:01:43.68
but it was like,

2068
02:01:43.68 --> 02:01:44.68
it's on front post today,

2069
02:01:44.68 --> 02:01:45.68
and like,

2070
02:01:45.68 --> 02:01:46.68
JP,

2071
02:01:46.68 --> 02:01:47.68
maybe,

2072
02:01:47.68 --> 02:01:48.68
yeah.

2073
02:01:48.68 --> 02:01:49.68
Yeah.

2074
02:01:49.68 --> 02:01:50.68
So that was one where it's like,

2075
02:01:50.68 --> 02:01:51.68
you know why they're,

2076
02:01:51.68 --> 02:01:52.68
you know why people are posting that,

2077
02:01:52.68 --> 02:01:53.68
because when they read it,

2078
02:01:53.68 --> 02:01:54.68
when they go,

2079
02:01:54.68 --> 02:01:55.68
they refer to it.

2080
02:01:55.68 --> 02:01:55.68
They're like,

2081
02:01:55.68 --> 02:01:55.68
oh,

2082
02:01:55.68 --> 02:01:56.68
click again.

2083
02:01:56.68 --> 02:01:57.68
Let me,

2084
02:01:57.68 --> 02:01:57.68
you know,

2085
02:01:57.68 --> 02:01:58.68
because that's kind of the whole nature,

2086
02:01:58.68 --> 02:01:59.68
post-leandings.

2087
02:01:59.68 --> 02:01:59.68
So the boom,

2088
02:01:59.68 --> 02:02:01.68
that's exactly what's happening.

2089
02:02:01.68 --> 02:02:01.68
So it's like,

2090
02:02:01.68 --> 02:02:02.68
boom,

2091
02:02:02.68 --> 02:02:03.68
I need to remember that one.

2092
02:02:03.68 --> 02:02:04.68
It's not like that's the first time they read it.

2093
02:02:04.68 --> 02:02:05.68
Maybe it is,

2094
02:02:05.68 --> 02:02:06.68
it's not,

2095
02:02:06.68 --> 02:02:06.68
but most of the time,

2096
02:02:06.68 --> 02:02:07.68
it's like,

2097
02:02:07.68 --> 02:02:07.68
okay,

2098
02:02:07.68 --> 02:02:08.68
I refer back to that.

2099
02:02:08.68 --> 02:02:09.68
And they're going to be posted.

2100
02:02:09.68 --> 02:02:10.68
So it's doing exactly what I'm saying.

2101
02:02:10.68 --> 02:02:11.68
It's reminding you.

2102
02:02:11.68 --> 02:02:12.68
Like,

2103
02:02:12.68 --> 02:02:21.68
I'm so overwhelmed.

2104
02:02:21.68 --> 02:02:22.68
And the,

2105
02:02:22.68 --> 02:02:23.68
you know,

2106
02:02:23.68 --> 02:02:24.68
certain ones apply to you at certain times,

2107
02:02:24.68 --> 02:02:25.68
too,

2108
02:02:25.68 --> 02:02:25.68
you know,

2109
02:02:25.68 --> 02:02:26.68
so it's like,

2110
02:02:26.68 --> 02:02:27.68
good man just to refer back to that.

2111
02:02:27.68 --> 02:02:29.68
So did I do it?

2112
02:02:29.68 --> 02:02:30.68
It will keep you on the path.

2113
02:02:30.68 --> 02:02:31.68
If you want the audio version,

2114
02:02:31.68 --> 02:02:33.68
it's not available on audible.com.

2115
02:02:33.68 --> 02:02:35.68
It's available on iTunes,

2116
02:02:35.68 --> 02:02:36.68
Amazon,

2117
02:02:36.68 --> 02:02:37.68
music,

2118
02:02:37.68 --> 02:02:37.68
Google,

2119
02:02:37.68 --> 02:02:39.68
play in other MP3 platforms.

2120
02:02:39.68 --> 02:02:41.68
Also extreme ownership.

2121
02:02:41.68 --> 02:02:43.68
Every different type of organization.

2122
02:02:43.68 --> 02:02:46.68
That's what everyone at echelon front does,

2123
02:02:46.68 --> 02:02:48.68
which is our leadership consulting business,

2124
02:02:48.68 --> 02:02:51.68
which is me and Lave Babin and J.P.D.D.

2125
02:02:51.68 --> 02:02:55.68
and Dave Burke and Flynn Gawkerna and Mike Surelli and Mike Bima.

2126
02:02:55.68 --> 02:02:56.68
That's what we do.

2127
02:02:56.68 --> 02:03:00.68
We talk about the fundamental principles that are in that book,

2128
02:03:00.68 --> 02:03:03.68
that we brought home from the battlefield.

2129
02:03:03.68 --> 02:03:05.68
And that book,

2130
02:03:05.68 --> 02:03:06.68
extreme ownership.

2131
02:03:06.68 --> 02:03:09.68
After we got done writing that book and taught that stuff,

2132
02:03:09.68 --> 02:03:11.68
we wrote another book.

2133
02:03:11.68 --> 02:03:13.68
It's called the dichotomy leadership,

2134
02:03:13.68 --> 02:03:15.68
which we also talked about a bunch of things.

2135
02:03:15.68 --> 02:03:19.68
Because you can't talk about leading human beings

2136
02:03:19.68 --> 02:03:22.68
without talking about extreme ownership.

2137
02:03:22.68 --> 02:03:26.68
The fundamental principles of the laws of combat.

2138
02:03:26.68 --> 02:03:28.68
And then when you start talking about that,

2139
02:03:28.68 --> 02:03:30.68
you've got to talk about the dichotomy leadership.

2140
02:03:30.68 --> 02:03:34.68
So those two books are also available.

2141
02:03:34.68 --> 02:03:38.68
And what I like seeing is when I got just saw on today,

2142
02:03:38.68 --> 02:03:42.68
Guy had probably posted a picture of 30 copies of the dichotomy leadership.

2143
02:03:42.68 --> 02:03:44.68
He's like, this is going to the whole team.

2144
02:03:44.68 --> 02:03:46.68
Because that's how you get everyone aligned.

2145
02:03:46.68 --> 02:03:48.68
You make everyone see,

2146
02:03:48.68 --> 02:03:48.68
oh, you know what?

2147
02:03:48.68 --> 02:03:49.68
I'm going to think of this way.

2148
02:03:49.68 --> 02:03:53.68
Now, some people go, oh, I don't want to share this secrets.

2149
02:03:53.68 --> 02:03:54.68
They want to keep it for themselves.

2150
02:03:54.68 --> 02:03:55.68
That doesn't help you.

2151
02:03:55.68 --> 02:03:56.68
You don't do better.

2152
02:03:56.68 --> 02:04:01.68
You do better if everyone understands the principles.

2153
02:04:01.68 --> 02:04:03.68
That's going to make you do better as the leader.

2154
02:04:03.68 --> 02:04:06.68
And by the way, if you're out there trying to do better for yourself,

2155
02:04:06.68 --> 02:04:09.68
don't read the book, go and do something else.

2156
02:04:09.68 --> 02:04:11.68
Because I don't even want you around.

2157
02:04:11.68 --> 02:04:12.68
Oh, just for yourself.

2158
02:04:12.68 --> 02:04:14.68
If you're just trying to look out for you,

2159
02:04:14.68 --> 02:04:16.68
the principles aren't for you.

2160
02:04:16.68 --> 02:04:19.68
You won't understand them properly.

2161
02:04:19.68 --> 02:04:23.68
So, and yet, if you want to win,

2162
02:04:23.68 --> 02:04:25.68
the best possible way to win,

2163
02:04:25.68 --> 02:04:28.68
by the way, isn't by looking out for yourself.

2164
02:04:28.68 --> 02:04:30.68
It's by looking out for the good of the team.

2165
02:04:30.68 --> 02:04:31.68
It's by looking out for the mission.

2166
02:04:31.68 --> 02:04:33.68
That's how you win.

2167
02:04:33.68 --> 02:04:35.68
And that's what these books will help you do.

2168
02:04:35.68 --> 02:04:39.68
So, there's those Asseline Front I already talked about at leadership consultancy.

2169
02:04:39.68 --> 02:04:44.68
If you want us to come and work with your company or come and speak to your company,

2170
02:04:44.68 --> 02:04:47.68
go to Asselinefront.com.

2171
02:04:47.68 --> 02:04:50.68
Don't contact the speakers bureau.

2172
02:04:50.68 --> 02:04:53.68
Don't Google Jocco speaking.

2173
02:04:53.68 --> 02:04:57.68
Because it will be a random speaking agent that you'll then have to work through.

2174
02:04:57.68 --> 02:05:01.68
Just contact us or company Asselinefront.com.

2175
02:05:01.68 --> 02:05:10.68
The Master, we have Master 7 and 8 in 2019.

2176
02:05:10.68 --> 02:05:13.68
Check X-rayMotorship.com.

2177
02:05:13.68 --> 02:05:15.68
Those are our leadership conferences.

2178
02:05:15.68 --> 02:05:17.68
And all of them have sold out.

2179
02:05:17.68 --> 02:05:19.68
Did I say some of them have sold out?

2180
02:05:19.68 --> 02:05:20.68
Nope.

2181
02:05:20.68 --> 02:05:22.68
All of them have sold out.

2182
02:05:22.68 --> 02:05:25.68
And they are all going to continue to sell out.

2183
02:05:25.68 --> 02:05:27.68
So, look for the details when the opportunity,

2184
02:05:27.68 --> 02:05:29.68
when we put the details out,

2185
02:05:29.68 --> 02:05:33.68
and you want to come sign up, that's extremotorship.com.

2186
02:05:33.68 --> 02:05:42.68
And then Overwatch is our business where we are taking special operations,

2187
02:05:42.68 --> 02:05:49.68
leaders, combat aviation leaders, and placing them into civilian organizations.

2188
02:05:49.68 --> 02:05:54.68
That need leadership, experience and trained leadership.

2189
02:05:54.68 --> 02:05:59.68
So, if you want to get involved with that, which ever side you're on,

2190
02:05:59.68 --> 02:06:04.68
efoverwatch.com, go there and you'll figure out which way to go,

2191
02:06:04.68 --> 02:06:10.68
whether you're someone from our communities or you're someone that needs leaders from our communities,

2192
02:06:10.68 --> 02:06:12.68
go and make that happen.

2193
02:06:12.68 --> 02:06:14.68
And if you want to stay on the path with us,

2194
02:06:14.68 --> 02:06:17.68

2196
02:06:23.68 --> 02:06:28.68
Eko is at Eko Charles and I am at Jocco Willink,

2197
02:06:28.68 --> 02:06:33.68
and thanks to all the military personnel worldwide.

2198
02:06:33.68 --> 02:06:38.68
Worldwide out there in harm's way holding the line.

2199
02:06:38.68 --> 02:06:43.68
And here at home, thanks to police and law enforcement and paramedics and EMTs and

2200
02:06:43.68 --> 02:06:46.68
correctional officers and border patrol and first responders.

2201
02:06:46.68 --> 02:06:51.68
And at this moment, actually, especially the firefighters out here fighting these

2202
02:06:51.68 --> 02:06:55.68
crazy and powerful fires in California,

2203
02:06:55.68 --> 02:07:02.68
thanks to you all and it was a lot of police and EMTs and paramedics supporting them as well.

2204
02:07:02.68 --> 02:07:03.68
Just all of you.

2205
02:07:03.68 --> 02:07:06.68
Thanks for risking your lives to make us safer.

2206
02:07:06.68 --> 02:07:12.68
And to the rest of you that are out there carrying on your mission.

2207
02:07:12.68 --> 02:07:15.68
Whatever that may be, but if you're listening,

2208
02:07:15.68 --> 02:07:19.68
I know you're in the game and trying to get better,

2209
02:07:19.68 --> 02:07:22.68
just like we are.

2210
02:07:22.68 --> 02:07:26.68
And if there's a change that you need to make in your life,

2211
02:07:26.68 --> 02:07:29.68
you know what you need to do.

2212
02:07:29.68 --> 02:07:34.68
Get after it and make that change.

2213
02:07:34.68 --> 02:07:54.68
And until next time, this is echo and jockel out.
