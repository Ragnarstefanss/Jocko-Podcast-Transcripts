There's a there's a note about this Raven's assessment so somebody kind of read that big assessment of San Hirsten and this guy says I read Simon Ravens paper with great interest when you when you ask from my comments you must bear in mind that in 1898 when I was gazetted I joined a totally different type of army from that of today it was an aristocratic army feudal in the sense that it was grounded on leadership and fall and fellowship in which with few exceptions the leaders were the sons of gentlemen and more frequently than not the eldest sons the most privileged sons when I went to San Hirst we were not taught to behave like gentlemen because it never occurred to anyone that we should behave otherwise we were taught a lot of obsolete tactics in every army the of that day did a tremendous lot of useless drill but never heard a word about responsibility, loyalty, guts, et cetera because so I suppose these were held to be the natural prerequisites of gentlemen so this is back in the day when it's like hey man you better act like this you you're upholding the family named the men the followers of that period were a rough lot simple tough alliterate largely recruited from down melts men who had a lot met who met who had gotten a lot of trouble vagabonds and a sprinkling of the grand sons and grandsons sons of nCOs and private soldiers military families who generally became nCOs they were therefore two distinct classes really cast by birth on the whole the men looked up to their officers whether they were a fission or insufficient or inefficient and the officers did not look down on their men why should they so he was saying like this was just kind of the way it was back then the idea of an officer imposing on his imposing his will on his men never entered his head because one class was so superior and the other so inferior that it was unnecessary to do this there wasn't even any opposing ideas to what you were saying the superior could not lose cast should he play or mix with his men I remember this is a good story I remember on my first tour as an orderly officer on the QMS was late for the QMS mean the quartermaster so one of the sailors was late for meat issue and I thought he had risked it because I was a novice so I put him under arrest when this was reported to the agitant he took me aside and said strictly speaking you were right but actually speaking you weren't ass so don't do it again and I didn't so he like punished this guy trying to prove that he was pretty said hey bro what are you knowing you you technically you could do that but that's not the way you treat your people of the present day democratic army I my total flight time was nine seconds just hope that I just cry out if you got to know enough 35 right now in the simulator I could over the shoulder you walk you through to you landed almost perfectly in the first drawing well that's like drones man those first drones came out that were like little model airplanes guys were just crashing everywhere and now a three year old confide drone and that's that's no such technology uh this thing says on the same note the net result would be a bi-modal distribution of officers at every grade so these two different types of officers you end up with them at every grade those who take risks and get away with it the Montgomerys and Lawrence is up this of this world and those who have plotted up the hard but safe way the good old boys you never speak out a turn who make up intact and conformity what they lack in enterprise and initiative interesting contemplation of a nept commander suggests that they were of the latter genre in the first place they were renowned almost without exception for being hypersensitive to criticism so those people that are the the the conformists high-percentive asked the question of physical bravery and no way to track from the feats of courage to note that the fear of being afraid the fear of social disemprovele for cowardice and most important the personal shame attendant upon flinching in the face of danger could drive a man to perform acts of valor far beyond the normal call of duty this is not to deny that bravery occurs for other reasons out of pure altruism or patriotism but merely that some individuals are so lacking in self-esteem that they will gladly exchange the fear of failure for their own physical destruction that's kind of a weird thing to say in a very real sense military organizations recognize and trade upon this fact of human nature death rather than dishonor is no empty platitude but formulates an essential and ancient feature of military i'll tell you what's a you would expand a little bit more which he doesn't what's scary about that is when people are being brave with other people's lives that that's what's jacked up look if you're brave and you go and do something heroic good on you i don't care what your motivation was i think same harris always talks about the fact that you can't you can't fake bravery right you run out in the street there's no fake in it so yes tell me what you think final spin it's available right now order it let me know what you think we're

Dave is at David our Burke echelon aquatrols and i am at jockel willink and to all the troops out there around the world and all at all those forgotten barricades thank you for the holding the line to protect those of us here at home and to our police law enforcement firefighters paramedics EMTs dispatchers correction officers board patrol secret service secret service and all first responders thank you for holding the line to keep us safe here on the home front and everyone else out there let me just remind you of that quote from Francis bacon why should a man be in love with his feathers though of a gold what's trapping you what's controlling you what's controlling your thoughts your ideas your beliefs what's controlling your mind and the things that are controlling you they might seem good they might be made of gold but they aren't slaving you nonetheless do not let that happen cast off those mental manacles and think for yourself and until next time this is Dave and echo and jockel out maybe I know you're not getting promoted but it did happen there are grounds for thinking that incompetent commanders tend to be those whom the need to avoid failure exceeds the urge to succeed according to JWAK and T-feather such people tend to issue activities which they may show up in a poor light and unless forced to so refrain from taking on any skilled task where there are any doubts about the outcome so people that are just concerned about themselves they'll only go into jobs where they know they're going to win that's what they're trying to do they're just they're only doing jobs of things that they know they're going to do if no one's going to win that here in lies especially lemma though they need to achieve it is the very nature of trying which exposes them to that which they fear most failure they are like people who try to climb mountains out of an underlying fear of heights it would not be surprising to find that such people are attracted to and prosper in the armed services for one place it carefully in the military and contrast the world of commerce offers achievement without tears stick to the rule book do nothing while explicit approval from the next higher up always confirm form never offend your superiors and you will float serenely if a trifle slowly upward a blip in both senses of the word that's the reality you can you there you can do that you can join the military and you can just kind of keep your nose clean stay low profile don't take any additional risks conform Is there anything in, I guess in the battlefield, it might be more black and white, but like in training or something like that where it's like maybe something optional or something that people don't want to wear or do that's for safety reasons, but it's like, it's like, it's not cool or it's like, you would ever sweat like that. right so like like like like Muhammad Ali right when he'd they'd be like oh how many situps do he's like I don't know him any situps they do because it only come I only start counting when it starts to hurt right but when you start being brave with other people's lives that's a freaking disaster that's what these horrible leaders end up doing it cannot be emphasized too strong only that this suggested relationship between valor and the need to prove oneself a no way to base his bravery on the contrary takes the view that the best measure of courage is the fear that is overcome then these were the bravest of them all for his only by conquering rational fear that they could nullify fear of being afraid so there you go the tragedy of this issue is that if military organizations select their senior commanders for their physical as opposed to moral bravery they not only might ignore other equally important attributes but are bound to select a proportion of individuals whose underlying psychopathology is quite unfitted to positions of high command in this way they invite incompetence so just because someone's brave doesn't mean you want to put them in a leadership position doesn't say you don't want them there and there is certainly a huge benefit to someone that's been in combat and knows what's happening knows the understands the emotions and and the human nature that takes place on the front lines for sure that's highly beneficial shouldn't be the only reason you select somebody though the last trait of those who harbour a fear of failure concerns the selection of subordinates they're really two components to this process the first concerns the way an individual sees himself in comparison with his competitors in the second the way he thinks others will see him in comparison with his contemporaries in either case he may well try to elevate his own self estimation by choosing a low standard with which to make comparison hence the phenomenon of people who tend to shun the company of individuals more gifted and even choose workmates as select or select as subordinates people who may consider inferior to themselves a lot of freaking disaster that is so that's the person that wants to look good so hires a bunch of idiots talks a little bit about haig he talks about haig being painfully aware of his limitations haig was a world war one commander of burnish troops and then try to enter the one profession open to the dumps of the family of the army only to find that even nary failed to shine he got put into his position the reason he got promoted is because he got sort of a hook up from a family member his elder sister hen rea to new the Duke of Cambridge hooked him up with ventured entry to staff college then he was the aid to camp to the king do this guy's just making moves make and moves became respected for his conventional opinions that's Then there's like, and then there's a little transition period where it's like, yeah, if you know where your seat belts kind of like, ah, like what you scared, like kind of weaker whatever. yes what do you got that whole that part about like not taking risks of your failure like that kind of stuff like first of whatever reason it was making me think of like the jujitsu journey ascending with like getting belts and all this stuff so in the beginning yeah got out of the we've there's been a very small it's been a very safe airplane what is enough 35 cost at the time it was 130 million now it's probably 90 also they cut the price down well those first ones are like you know they were literally the very first ones off the assembly and so that that as you know like that mass production benefit hadn't continued so age one was kind of like a unique article now like their jammer amount they're making a bunch of them right so you think oh cool this is like a hierarchy set up that make sense I'm down I want to go in there because I'm an entrepreneur I'm a go getter sometimes it does in the case of wellington Montgomery rommel and zukov men with in order to lead strong needs for achievement all those guys wanted to do well unfortunately however there are aspects of a military career which are unlikely to attract people with high achievement motivation the fact that traditionally promotion depends upon seniority class wealth conformity and obedience may well leave them rather cold neither means nor the ends are sufficiently attractive so when you get a guy like Wellington like rommel they look and say okay and I think the thing I was thinking about and this is military I think in general there are enough jobs in the military that have been done enough times that the template is there that you know I can take those set orders and like man it's really low risk you know cookie cutter job that's been done I can take the template jocos going off to me here's the you know here's the script follow the script low profile low risk you're going to look good in the end but if you start let's say you get like I don't know purple about that feel like it's one of the benchmark balance right for sure kind of become that's like jujitsu puberty right there you know so a lot of people and it can vary from belt to belt for sure but the minute you you have that attitude and you start to impose it on people around you you need to check yourself you need to check yourself because you're shutting down mind your closing minds and you're really in the long term hurt in your organization you were come across a situation it feels like it's feels like it's real common where you get to people they're going to business together one guys risk averse one guys like freaking try anything and they sort of start to balance each other for sure and not to mention there's some jobs that are kind of more conducive for certain attitude types remember that there's some people that are out there for themselves and there's some people that are out there to try and do a good job he says compare Lawrence and this is Lawrence of Arabia compare Lawrence roughing it with his tiny Arab force on the 800 mile trek across the desert to west to to rest akaba from the Turks with towns and comfortably a sconce and his villa on the sea of mormara while his captured troops died in their thousands from exposure malnutrition and brutality the contrast in both cases in between the self imposed as sadism of high achievement motivation and the self indulgence of one concerned with professional excellence less concerned with professional excellence than with personal advantage pretty good stark difference between those two how is it that some of the criteria for promotion to military organizations are evidently such as to favor people with a pathological degree of achievement motivation this is scary the person that might have a tendency to get promoted is the one that's looking out for themselves in some cases in the military again isn't important to say this isn't like the entire military but certainly I certainly saw people in the military that were 100% looking out for themselves and they got promoted Second they accentuate the challenge of promotional ladder by making certain upward movements very difficult indeed third the ethos of the armed forces is such that such as to make advancement lovable and highly rewarding generals have every advantage bar that of age over those lower down on the ladder they are richer, safer and more comfortable their chances of collecting honors orders and nighthooks are imminently greater than those of more junior ranks finally even the most modest thirst for achievement is encouraged by training and convention the taboo on junior speaking to senior seniors in officer training establishments saluting and being saluted orders of march rules as to say as who says sir to whom all serve to emphasize the horizontal stratifications of military organizations besides adding lustre to each new level gained so that's what the military sets up this really nice place where you can kind of you see what the game is and if you don't want to play the game you're going to get you're going to get satisfaction unfortunately there are aspects of military career which are unlikely to attract people with high achievement motivation and he says this at first sight these arguments would seem to suggest that the possibility of promotion in the military organization would attract those with a potential for achievement go getters entrepreneurs innovators and men with energy and drive in short people who would make first class military commanders and and you're right in saying like that's part of the system is is you have you might show for this altruism of how it works and the wrong people get promoted sometimes now it's not a lot of those people's actually a small number like you said but it happens enough that you will see it you're not going to go a career and go oh I never saw that every single time it was the right person of the right reasons I I wonder we that park is it's just a different world this is the different situation and they court sort of had this pre-existing system that was in place now what kind of makes me disturbed about this is you know he's he's basically talking about how great the gentleman were of the day but these were the gentleman that freaking acted like idiots leading their troops to be killed so there wasn't so much honor and principle as he's talking about close now this section he says from a general study of leadership it seems there is much in military organizations to invite incompetence officers are selected for the wrong reasons required to fulfill in compatible roles and expected to function adequately in a communication system of dubious efficiency at higher levels of command they are protected from adverse criticism by their invisibility and by the plain fact that in times of stress even the poorest leaders like drunken fathers and rabbits feet are clung to with pathetic if misplaced dependency so you gotta be like a certain limited amount of gas so the plane is light enough to hover but then again like you can't just sit there all day long because you don't have that much gas it's nothing like the hair year was those guys it was sketchy like yes it can can it then provide opportunities for people to sort of just get on board with the system yes it can does the civilian sector do that as well how yes it does happens in any leadership situation where we take these things that we should be striving for like freedom of expression and unfettered cognitive processes meaning you should just be able to think and we crush them and you know I was thinking this uh we've been talking about the the the EO leadership loop and included not as the is the Udlu right these ideas of constantly running through your mind all these different aspects of leadership and the main list lesson that you and I put out this is what we've just put out the monster the main lesson when you're running these loops is not to get stuck is not to get stuck is to free your mind and that's how I close out the last podcast you know like if you don't know if you're not in the know you go you you you have a awesome selection you know you know that the orange is going to come through wouldn't you agree I don't like that I feel like I don't like it either I feel like I do I take offense to it maybe maybe The complaint was like, oh, it's the tactile like I want to press the buttons and turn the knobs and it's harder to feel and like, can you know, can you cut the fingertips off? i think i said something i really flip it like trust me or like i know where where did i don't like to use Yeah, it's like, I don't kind of think, I remember, okay, you know, all you have entrepreneurs, and then you have like employee types, right? I sure a little of my specific but you can kind of see it where you know if you're focused on the belt you tend to be more like fear failure kind of approach to training and but if you're just like hey I'm in here to get better and learn and be humble take risks you would happen all this stuff compete
