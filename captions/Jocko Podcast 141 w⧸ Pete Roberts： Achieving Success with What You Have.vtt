00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.50
This is Jocobodcast number 141, with echo Charles and me, Jocob Willink.

2
00:00:06.50 --> 00:00:07.000
Good evening, Jocob Willink.

3
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Good evening, Jocob Willink.

4
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Good evening.

5
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
March 15th, 1631.

6
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Most loving and kind father and mother,

7
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
my humble duty remembered unto you,

8
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
trusting in God you are in good health,

9
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
and I pray, remember my love unto my brother Joseph,

10
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
and thank him for his kindness that I found at his hand in London.

11
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
I know loving father and I do confess

12
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
that I was an undutiful child unto you

13
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
when I lived there with you and by you,

14
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
for which I am much sorrowful and grieved for it,

15
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
trusting in God that he will guide me

16
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
that I will never offend you so anymore,

17
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
and I trust in God that you will forgive me for it.

18
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
My writing unto you is to let you understand

19
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
what a country this new England is where we live.

20
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Here are a few Indians, a great part of them died this winter.

21
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
It was thought it was of the plague.

22
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Here is Timber Good Store, and A. Corn's Good Store,

23
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
and here is Good Store of Fish,

24
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
if we had boats to go for it,

25
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
and lines to serve fishing.

26
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
People here are subject to diseases.

27
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
For there, for here,

28
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
200 odd have died of scurvy,

29
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
and of the burning fever,

30
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
and beside as many lie lame.

31
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
All Sudbury men are dead,

32
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
but three, and three women, and some children.

33
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Here is no cloth to be had to make no apparel and shoes.

34
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
So I pray, Father, send me four or five yards of cloth

35
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
to make some apparel, and loving Father,

36
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
though I be far distant from you,

37
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
yet I pray you remember me as your child,

38
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.000
and we do not know how long we may subsist.

39
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
I pray, do not put away your shop stuff,

40
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
before I think that in the end,

41
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
if I live,

42
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
it must be my living,

43
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
for we do not know how long this plantation will stand.

44
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.000
God half-taking away the cheapest stud in the land,

45
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Mr. Johnson, and the lady Arabela his wife,

46
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
which was the cheapest man of a state in the land,

47
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
and one that would have done most good.

48
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000
So, Father, I pray, consider of my cause,

49
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
for here will be but a very poor thing,

50
00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
no being without loving Father,

51
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
your help with provisions from Old England.

52
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
I thought to come home in this ship,

53
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
for my provisions were almost all spent,

54
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
but that I humbly thank you for your great love

55
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
and kindness in sending some provisions,

56
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
or else I should,

57
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
and mine, a bin half-famished.

58
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
But now I will,

59
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
if it please God, that I have my health,

60
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
I will plant what corn I can.

61
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
My wife remembers her humble duty unto you,

62
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000
and to my mother, and my love to brother Joseph,

63
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.000
thus I leave you to the protection of Almighty God.

64
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
Watertown, New England,

65
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000
and that is an un-signed letter.

66
00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000
From, as I said, 1631, so these are settlers

67
00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
coming into New England,

68
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
the letters written back to Father in England,

69
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.000
and obviously written from a place called New England,

70
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
which is where I grew up,

71
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
and where I am in the woods of right now,

72
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
in Franklin County, Maine,

73
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.000
and we have a guest today that is also a New Englander,

74
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
a Gjitzu Black Belt, a business owner,

75
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
and a friend of mine,

76
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
by the name of Peter Roberts.

77
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
He's been on the podcast before,

78
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
so if you haven't listened to podcast 93 yet,

79
00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000
and you need to go get the backstory of how I met Peter,

80
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
and how this little deal got underway,

81
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
go listen to podcast 93,

82
00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
and then you can come back here,

83
00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
and listen to the rest of this one.

84
00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
So here we go, Pete.

85
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
Welcome back.

86
00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.000
Thanks for having me,

87
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
and I'm extremely honored to be back on,

88
00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
and was a little bit nervous to come back on,

89
00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
but after all you're rising,

90
00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
and motivating and flanking me,

91
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
and after what you just read, I'm ready to go.

92
00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
Yeah, we got a pretty easy compared to those guys,

93
00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.000
holy shit.

94
00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000
And it's interesting because I live in Southern California,

95
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
Echo as we know is from Hawaii,

96
00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
and what's the temperature variation in Hawaii?

97
00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.000
In Hawaii?

98
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.000
In Hauai, how much does the temperature vary?

99
00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
One degree, just kidding.

100
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
I don't know, 10. It's 20.

101
00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.000
We're talking 10.

102
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.000
We're talking 10.

103
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
We're talking about 20.

104
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
In the past three days,

105
00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
there was a 40 degree change here in the weather in Maine.

106
00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
It went from like 90 to 50.

107
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
Yeah, absolutely gives you a false sense of hope.

108
00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
One day actually took it.

109
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
These people that settled here,

110
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
clearly were some sturdy stock that came up here.

111
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
You think about what they went through

112
00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
and leaving the comforts of England,

113
00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:57.000
and what I was thinking about is it's not like these were woodsmen from England.

114
00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.000
Right?

115
00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
They weren't hunters from England.

116
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.000
I'm going to share some of them more.

117
00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
But they were people from England from London,

118
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
and then they were all of a sudden surrounded by this.

119
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
And you can't prepare for,

120
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
like there's nothing you can do conditioning-wise

121
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
to prepare for this.

122
00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
You get here and you survive.

123
00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.000
And that's what they were doing.

124
00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.000
Well, you're talking about like,

125
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
because his dad had sent him provisions.

126
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
That was his insurance policy.

127
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
You know, I mean, hey, here's what we can offer you.

128
00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
And I never thought about on the other side of things

129
00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:35.000
as a parent, like who knows what they had for work or jobs or who knows if they sent them everything they had.

130
00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.000
And financially what they could afford to send their son to keep him alive in New England.

131
00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:46.000
And you've got a pretty much figure that when your kid sails across the sea in 1631,

132
00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
you are never going to see them again.

133
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.000
Right?

134
00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
And you've got to figure you're never going to see them again.

135
00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.000
Yeah.

136
00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.000
That's got to be the thought.

137
00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.000
All right.

138
00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:01.000
So welcome back, like I said, now last podcast, obviously we talked about origin, boom.

139
00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.000
And we talked about where it started, how it started,

140
00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:11.000
the trials and tribulations to say at least that you went through getting it to that point.

141
00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.000
But it's been a pretty, so you were on the podcast one year ago,

142
00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
because we were up at this origin camp one year ago.

143
00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
And now you're back on it again, but it's been a big year.

144
00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:26.000
Been a huge bit of, been a big year of growth for the company.

145
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
How many people?

146
00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000
We've grown by another 30 people.

147
00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
So total, we're looking at 40 people.

148
00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.000
Yeah.

149
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.000
Yeah.

150
00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:42.000
And I think this time last year we were, yeah, right around 12 to 15.

151
00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
And you know what, is crazy.

152
00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
I don't know if I told you this, this time last year, like I don't,

153
00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
I don't get real stressed out.

154
00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:55.000
This time last year we had the immersion camp.

155
00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.000
Right.

156
00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000
We had the grand opening in the factory.

157
00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:08.000
We had just moved 60,000 square foot factory into our factory.

158
00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
Like two or three weeks prior.

159
00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
And it was still moving into.

160
00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.000
And there were some other things going on with business, whatever.

161
00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:22.000
And I don't know if I told you this one night, I left camp during the, during camp.

162
00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
I don't tell me that I left camp and went home.

163
00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
I was by myself and my family was still here.

164
00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
And I was laying them bad.

165
00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
And I couldn't, I couldn't get to sleep.

166
00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
And I just felt really weird.

167
00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
Like my, my body felt weird.

168
00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.000
And all of a sudden my heart, I felt like it was beating through my chest.

169
00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
And I was like, well, what is going on?

170
00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
I'm going to come to find out how things I had to attack.

171
00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.000
Never had it in my life.

172
00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
I haven't had one sense.

173
00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
And there was more going on.

174
00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.000
So what does that actually mean?

175
00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.000
I don't even know what that whole dude.

176
00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
I had never, I sounds like some echo.

177
00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
30, 30 years.

178
00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.000
You're cruising through it.

179
00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.000
Right.

180
00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
You mean 38 years old.

181
00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
And it was like, I don't know what brought it on.

182
00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
I think there was a lot of, so what does that actually mean?

183
00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000
So it means you're, your blood, your whole structure goes up.

184
00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
And scientifically, I don't know.

185
00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
All I know is it was like, I think you're going to tell me hard attack.

186
00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.000
No, dude.

187
00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
I had, and I was like, whoa, and I just, man, I know.

188
00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
So how do you know what was an anxiety attack?

189
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.000
I told somebody what happened.

190
00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
And then they said, that was an anxiety attack.

191
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
I was like, okay, I'm not having one of those again.

192
00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
That was because we took down two elephants instead.

193
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
Do you think that's the most stress you've ever been then?

194
00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.000
No.

195
00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.000
I mean, I, again, I don't feel like it was, no.

196
00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
I mean, no, not a body of clothes.

197
00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.000
I mean, what do you think brought it on?

198
00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:51.000
I think it was a little bit of the unknown of what's to come.

199
00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.000
Now, this is, now it just got interesting because you're sitting here complaining about the,

200
00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000
we're not complaining, but you're making a statement about the unknown.

201
00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
Now imagine getting on board of all the wood and ship and saying,

202
00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
across the country, that's, there's no pictures.

203
00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
You don't know what this place looks like.

204
00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.000
You have expectations.

205
00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
You've heard about Indians.

206
00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:10.000
Right.

207
00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
With Tomahawk.

208
00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.000
Right.

209
00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.000
That's what you've heard about.

210
00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:15.000
Right.

211
00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:15.000
Yeah.

212
00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:16.000
That's got to be stressful.

213
00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.000
So that was sort of a point when we, when you were on last time,

214
00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.000
it was at sort of everything was launching at one time, new factory,

215
00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
yet all this stuff going on.

216
00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.000
And the day after we recorded that podcast was what?

217
00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
The day after I went home and slept that night,

218
00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
we recorded the podcast.

219
00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
Okay.

220
00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.000
I remember sitting in the factory that night in a friend of mine drove by late night

221
00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
and we were recording and all the lights were on in the factory.

222
00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
And what it was, it was just crazy.

223
00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000
You know, the tri-de-de- old New England church bells in the background.

224
00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
It's just an awesome, awesome time.

225
00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:58.000
And that kind of like got me to erase that, my body only calmed down at that point

226
00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
and I reset and good.

227
00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
Never had it before and never had it after.

228
00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
Well, I'll tell you what, it was crazy from my perspective.

229
00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000
Is when we were first thinking up and we were buying the building.

230
00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.000
Right?

231
00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
And so I'm kind of, you know, hey cool, we're buying a building

232
00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:17.000
and we got this going on and then I get up there and I go in the building

233
00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000
and the building is, it's pretty big, you know?

234
00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000
And I'm thinking, well this is a big, pretty big building that we have.

235
00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000
And do we need, I'm thinking, you know, it's myself,

236
00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
do we need this big of a building?

237
00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000
I'm thinking myself, well, do we get a little crazy with this building?

238
00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:40.000
And then I come back now one year later and we have two small of the building in one year.

239
00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000
And so instead of there being four people, five people,

240
00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
stitching at a time, everyone's stitching.

241
00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
And there's machines are filled.

242
00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.000
The shipping areas completely filled with product going out.

243
00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:57.000
That's a lot of, that's, that's like an exponential.

244
00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:01.000
How much more are you shipping a day now compared to a year ago?

245
00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:06.000
We are shipping probably 10 times as much right now.

246
00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000
And it's growing daily exponentially.

247
00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.000
Wow.

248
00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.000
You know, the thing is is like just to frame this, just to frame this, right?

249
00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
It's, it's a fallout shelter.

250
00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000
I mean, that's what we bought was a fallout shelter.

251
00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
It was built during the Cold War.

252
00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:22.000
This thing is reinforced.

253
00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000
Like when they brought that 800 amp power in,

254
00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000
because we had to, we had to bring three phase power in.

255
00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
They had to change the transformers because we were sucking all the power from the pound.

256
00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.000
So they literally, and it was pretty real.

257
00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.000
And so I was like negotiating with the power company, central man power.

258
00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
And you know, I get them up there and I tell them,

259
00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.000
I vision getting by out.

260
00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:42.000
Like because they, it's a company.

261
00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
They're going to negotiate a little bit.

262
00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:45.000
Otherwise, we'll put up solar.

263
00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.000
Exactly.

264
00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
So they came in.

265
00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
They put all the new transformers on on the, the pole,

266
00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
you know, and the ran in the building.

267
00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000
And then the electrical company, the electricians who were friends,

268
00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
also of us and they're like,

269
00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
they're like, okay, we got to bore through the concrete.

270
00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:08.000
And they, they barely were able to bore through that concrete.

271
00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
I have a, I have a, what do you call it?

272
00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:11.000
A cylinder.

273
00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
They took two cylinders out of the wall.

274
00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
And it was like that was so hard.

275
00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
Because, you know, concrete gets harder as it ages.

276
00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.000
But it is the towns, the factory is the towns fall out shelter.

277
00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:24.000
I don't know if I've told you that.

278
00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
No, when you, so when you go down the stairs, it says fall out shelter.

279
00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
Yeah, I have saw that, but I thought it was,

280
00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
I didn't know that was the purpose of the whole build.

281
00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:35.000
Originally, sent, originally the power company built it.

282
00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:39.000
But because it was built during the cold war, it became the fall out.

283
00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000
We tried to get all the tax breaks to put the fall out shelter.

284
00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:43.000
Probably something like that.

285
00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.000
Probably.

286
00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000
So you added 40 people, how many products?

287
00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000
I mean, it is just as far as products.

288
00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000
I mean, we're adding monthly, you know,

289
00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
I mean, nutritionally on the nutritional side.

290
00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000
And with our partnership, like in terms of the jockel products,

291
00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:01.000
which have, you know, been ridiculously awesome for the masses,

292
00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:06.000
along with some of the new stuff we're doing and jiu-jitsu and on the lifestyle and the things

293
00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:14.000
as we grow, the vision and we grow, and we bring our message proliferate our message to the masses.

294
00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:19.000
You know, we're just, we're providing people with what they want, you know?

295
00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:23.000
And, you know, what's funny is some of that providing them with what they want is

296
00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000
this kind of a neat thing.

297
00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000
Like, we had Charlie Breneman here, the Spanard,

298
00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
used to fight in UFC Big UFC fighter,

299
00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.000
and he came into the factory yesterday and he walked in the back door

300
00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
and he walked in 10 steps and he stopped.

301
00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000
And he's a pretty cerebral guy, you know?

302
00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000
I mean, you don't get to the top level in the UFC.

303
00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000
If you're not a cerebral person like that.

304
00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000
And he looked at me and he said, hey, he said, hey,

305
00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000
he said, hey, Pete, you told me there were no stupid questions

306
00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000
because that's what I always preface everything with.

307
00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:59.000
I say, no, no, shoot, he's like, why do I feel the way I feel?

308
00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000
And I was like, what do you mean he's like?

309
00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.000
Like a little bit shocked and confused.

310
00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:11.000
And I said, well, that's because it's natural

311
00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:15.000
to feel that way when you haven't seen people building products

312
00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000
with their hands and a factory environment.

313
00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:22.000
We've only heard about it through the television or books

314
00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
because it all has gone away.

315
00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000
And our generation were about the same age.

316
00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000
You know, we didn't see it, you know?

317
00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.000
Maybe we're kids as it was just leaving.

318
00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:36.000
And he was just like, man, this is just incredible.

319
00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
You know, just couldn't wrap his head around

320
00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000
and he was just wandering around that factory up and down like,

321
00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:45.000
holy cow, man, this is, and once you see it,

322
00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:46.000
you feel it.

323
00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:47.000
It's a physical change.

324
00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000
You know, it's like when you have, and this is might be accessible

325
00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
when you have your first child and you see your child

326
00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:53.000
is like this chemical reaction.

327
00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:57.000
Man, when you walk into a factory where there is people

328
00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000
working with their hands and working together

329
00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000
to bring this thing to life, it's, it's bringing something

330
00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000
to life in a different way and another parallel.

331
00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:06.000
So it's awesome to see.

332
00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:12.000
At what point did factory get a negative connotation?

333
00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.000
You think I have my own theories which I'll share.

334
00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.000
Please do.

335
00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.000
Because when people go, oh factory work, they think, oh,

336
00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.000
that's bad.

337
00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:25.000
You're sitting there doing some menial task over and over again.

338
00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.000
That's what some people think of factory work.

339
00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:29.000
And I'll agree with you.

340
00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000
And I bet you, that is part of what Charlie was feeling

341
00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.000
when he walked in there, what you think of a factory

342
00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.000
is not what a factory is, especially in our case.

343
00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:38.000
Right.

344
00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.000
And they're portrayed negatively.

345
00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:45.000
But it's all education.

346
00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.000
And here's what happened in that letter.

347
00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:52.000
He said, we don't have any textiles to make a parallel

348
00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000
and clothing.

349
00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000
Or probably leather yet,

350
00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:00.000
to make shoes and accessories.

351
00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.000
Things you need for survival.

352
00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:08.000
So New Englanders were forced into a position.

353
00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:11.000
And we talked about like Hans and daylight, right?

354
00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000
They had their hands and they had daylight.

355
00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:17.000
And they had whatever they brought for livestock to be able to build

356
00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:18.000
their farms.

357
00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000
They cleared the fields by hand.

358
00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000
They cut the trees by hand.

359
00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.000
And if you've ever stumped a tree by hand,

360
00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000
that's an absolute nightmare.

361
00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000
One tree could take a full day to stump it, to pull the

362
00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.000
stomps and roots out of the ground, to build a field to have

363
00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000
the cows to raise the cattle.

364
00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000
Have you stumped a tree by hand?

365
00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:37.000
Oh, yeah.

366
00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000
What's that process?

367
00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.000
You've got to do it.

368
00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000
So to stump a tree by hand, you have to,

369
00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000
you've got to treat down.

370
00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000
You dig around like all the roots.

371
00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.000
And then you take an axe and you've got the roots as low as you can.

372
00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:50.000
And you pull the stump up.

373
00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:54.000
And the stump is massively heavy because it's the wood.

374
00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:57.000
And it's all the organics that have grown around it.

375
00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:58.000
It comes up with it.

376
00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.000
It's a challenge.

377
00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.000
You have never done that without a machine.

378
00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:05.000
With how to machine, which they didn't have.

379
00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:06.000
Yeah.

380
00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:10.000
You know, and so there was this necessity to live.

381
00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.000
And it, okay, we have to be self-sufficient.

382
00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.000
We can't rely on provisions from England.

383
00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.000
We have to become self-sufficient.

384
00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:22.000
So the direction and the focus of the people in,

385
00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:27.000
as a union was amazing when people come together for a common cause.

386
00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.000
We know that's an amazing thing.

387
00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:34.000
And as immigration happened, you know, the French, the Irish,

388
00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:38.000
and everything else, they all came together to build these factories

389
00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.000
to harness the power of New England's rivers.

390
00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:44.000
And they had to.

391
00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:48.000
And, but what happens as after had to now you have it.

392
00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:53.000
And over the generations, it's expected and you become complacent.

393
00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:56.000
And complacency is what tore us down.

394
00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:59.000
Because we didn't fight hard enough to keep our factors here.

395
00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:00.000
We just didn't.

396
00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.000
We didn't fight hard enough.

397
00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:02.000
Why?

398
00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:06.000
Because we're complacent, you know, everyone's making a great wage.

399
00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.000
And this is 150 years later.

400
00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:12.000
The textile mills and the spinning mills and the dihouses.

401
00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:17.000
And the, you know, the boot companies and the leather factories and the tanneries.

402
00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:22.000
And all of those things were right around here, right around this area.

403
00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.000
But it becomes expected.

404
00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.000
And it went away.

405
00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.000
You know, in a way, in the early 2000s, late 90s.

406
00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:34.000
So the timeline touches us, right?

407
00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:39.000
But didn't have impact as it did on some of the older folks.

408
00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:46.000
Did we get sold a bill a good at some point that factory, like as people were trying to move factories overseas.

409
00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:47.000
And they could save money.

410
00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:52.000
Did we get sold a bill of goods that, hey, factory work isn't what you want to be doing?

411
00:19:52.000 --> 00:20:01.000
Well, what I think is that through the complacency, you know, like if you look at our grandparents, for instance,

412
00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:05.000
which they told us the stories.

413
00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:09.000
Hey, I used to go to the mill when I was eight, I go to the tannery.

414
00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.000
I pulled tax out of the hides. That was my grandfather.

415
00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:16.000
His mother worked in the low spinning mills, right?

416
00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:20.000
So she was in low Massachusetts and she worked on the spinning mills.

417
00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:25.000
You know, making the, the wool yarn or the cotton yarn to weave the tax dials.

418
00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:30.000
She actually used to, at that, at the end of the shift, she would sweep up all the excess wool.

419
00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:39.000
She'd go home and she'd spin it by hand and she'd make blankets and stuff with it, which we, we have one in the family, which is pretty cool.

420
00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:46.000
So you hear these stories, but you heard it as through the eyes of hardship.

421
00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:50.000
So immediately you're thinking that this is a hard life.

422
00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.000
So that's how we were taught.

423
00:20:52.000 --> 00:21:02.000
And so the way that we were brought up more so is that you need to go to college to get an education, so you don't have the hardship.

424
00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:05.000
Factory work now is a totally different beast.

425
00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:10.000
It's not like, back then yes, eight years old, bare feet working.

426
00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.000
That's what happened.

427
00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:20.000
And, and I think that the mindset, the gritty mindset, I think what was,

428
00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:30.000
what was, what's trying to take place was that kind of the hard work and work ethic and grit, you know, trying to be passed down to us, our, our parents and then us.

429
00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:36.000
But what didn't happen was the experiential knowledge of it. So you just heard it.

430
00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:42.000
And you know how it is when you don't experience and experience something you really don't know.

431
00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:46.000
And we became complacent and then the jobs left.

432
00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:50.000
They've just left, you know, trade opened up and they left.

433
00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:54.000
I mean, big business taken away.

434
00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.000
And the reverberation.

435
00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:04.000
I don't think that right there is, you know, when people complain about the corporate, you know, corporate making decisions.

436
00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.000
That's what they're complaining about.

437
00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.000
Is that you're not, because it's true.

438
00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:14.000
At a corporation, you can make a decision 100% based on bottom line.

439
00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:22.000
And unfortunately, those aren't, they're usually, or you can be tempted to make bad strategic decisions.

440
00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:30.000
And even though you might win in the short term for this quarter or next quarter or this fiscal year, in the long run, what do you end up with?

441
00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:32.000
Exactly. What do you end up with?

442
00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:42.000
And I'm not going to blame it on, let's say, the owners and administrators and the folks above.

443
00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:46.000
Right? And I'm not going to blame it on the workers.

444
00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:56.000
I'm going to blame it on the detachment and to take, you know, what, what, what, what, what, what, the whole thing you do with leadership, right?

445
00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.000
The culture became bad.

446
00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:04.000
And I'm going to tell you why I believe this, our, our third loom we bought.

447
00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:10.000
We, after we discovered the first two, I discovered this Italian guy.

448
00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:12.000
His name was Mario.

449
00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:20.000
And I, I just started calling people trying to find like, there was this mill in Sanford, Maine, a huge mill, like a million square feet.

450
00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:24.000
And I heard it, I heard it shut down.

451
00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:30.000
And I called the town. And I was like, hey, I heard about this mill. Somebody said there might be some equipment in there.

452
00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:32.000
Some old equipment, blah, blah, blah.

453
00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:36.000
And they're like, oh, yeah, this guy, Mario owns it.

454
00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:40.000
Maybe you should try calling the tax assessor.

455
00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:44.000
I said, okay, so I called the tax assessor.

456
00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:52.000
And like, yeah, yeah, we, we know this person Mario, yeah, he, he shut the mill down.

457
00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:58.000
And we have some contact information for him, but it was very cold.

458
00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:02.000
And I was like, okay, so he gave me the number and I called and I left a message.

459
00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:08.000
And I said, hey, my name's Pete Roberts.

460
00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:14.000
I'm trying to bring textiles back to Maine.

461
00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:16.000
And I'd like to talk to you about your mill.

462
00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:20.000
And he called me back, and he's an old guy, and he's a Italian.

463
00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:26.000
And the Italians are the ones that make the really good looms for long, long, long time.

464
00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:30.000
You know, about a hundred years, two hundred years, whatever it was.

465
00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:36.000
And his family had been in weaving and in textiles for a hundred years.

466
00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:39.000
And he said to me, Pete, he said, let me tell you something.

467
00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:42.000
And his Italian accent.

468
00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:48.000
He said, we didn't want to shut the doors.

469
00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:51.000
He said, but I did.

470
00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:55.000
He said, I shut the doors, I locked it up, and I walked away.

471
00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:00.000
And every single piece of machinery is still in that mill.

472
00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.000
I said, what?

473
00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:03.000
I'm getting chills.

474
00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.000
I'm getting chills.

475
00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:09.000
Every single piece of machinery is still in that mill.

476
00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:13.000
He said, if you can do something about that, I'm willing to work with you.

477
00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:16.000
I said, open the doors for me, man.

478
00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:19.000
He goes, let me tell you something.

479
00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:24.000
When I went to the town, when they basically wanted to take advantage of me,

480
00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:26.000
take advantage of me on the tax base.

481
00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:29.000
And I still had 40 people working there.

482
00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:32.000
They wouldn't work with me.

483
00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:37.000
He said, it wasn't me that wanted to strip it away.

484
00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:39.000
It was a mixture.

485
00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:42.000
He said, yeah, I had the shut the doors, because I was forced to.

486
00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:44.000
They forced my hand.

487
00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:47.000
The people didn't want to lose their jobs, but at the same time he said,

488
00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:53.000
the people were basically putting pressure on him, right?

489
00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:55.000
Like they're looking up like, hey, you can pay us more.

490
00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:56.000
Hey, you can do this.

491
00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:57.000
Hey, you can do this.

492
00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:01.000
And then he said, when I went to the town, and they wouldn't help us with any of this,

493
00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:03.000
he goes, what am I going to do?

494
00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:05.000
Shut the doors and walk away.

495
00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:08.000
So we have a people that's complacent.

496
00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:14.000
We have a town that has a spec expects what they expect and is inflexible.

497
00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:20.000
And you put the owner in a position where he needs to react.

498
00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:23.000
He needs to make a decision.

499
00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:25.000
And his decision was shut the doors and walk away.

500
00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:28.000
That's what he did.

501
00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:30.000
You want me to tell that story about that mill?

502
00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:31.000
Yeah.

503
00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:32.000
It's dude.

504
00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:34.000
We get there.

505
00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:37.000
And he's like, call this guy, Jim.

506
00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:38.000
He's at the mill.

507
00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:41.000
He is the night watcher, whatever.

508
00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:44.000
He's the caretaker for the property.

509
00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:47.000
And I met Jim and he said, the big white beard is sold in gentlemen.

510
00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:52.000
And he used to make the warps that won't be fabric.

511
00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:57.000
And he was very protective of everything, very protective.

512
00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:00.000
And you know what's funny is history channel.

513
00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.000
They sent a crew with us for this.

514
00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.000
They were going to do a TV show way back.

515
00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:06.000
And anyways, so we have this whole film crew.

516
00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:08.000
And we have this author show us here sometimes.

517
00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:09.000
It's crazy.

518
00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.000
So he unlocks.

519
00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:13.000
So it's all overgrown grass.

520
00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:15.000
The windows are smashed.

521
00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:18.000
The bricks are basically like falling apart.

522
00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.000
I mean, it's just deteriorated.

523
00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:28.000
And he opens door and walks in in the smell of years of no heat.

524
00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:31.000
And the cold and the heat and the cold.

525
00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:35.000
Everything was peeled and all the floorboards were punky and popped up.

526
00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:36.000
Nail sticking up and everything.

527
00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:42.000
But we walked in that mill and it was exactly set up the way he left it.

528
00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:49.000
I'm talking huge cotton processing machines made out of wood with needles to separate

529
00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:51.000
to card the cotton to pull the organic out.

530
00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:58.000
I'm talking a I would say a football field long spinning machines to spin yarn.

531
00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:03.000
And then Jim after I started talking to him about what we're doing.

532
00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:04.000
Because he was just cold.

533
00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:08.000
He was just like what number, what number loom were you getting from him?

534
00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:09.000
That was number three.

535
00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:12.000
And the warp.

536
00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:17.000
So we he in then I saw like six looms on the floor.

537
00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:20.000
And I was like, you guys have a loom.

538
00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:23.000
See, he's like, let me show you something.

539
00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:26.000
And were they rusted with a broken worn or were they in okay condition?

540
00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:29.000
They had not been run for 20 years, I think.

541
00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:32.000
So they were in okay condition because they were between floors.

542
00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:36.000
So the top floor was just destroyed.

543
00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:39.000
And you know all those bins we have in the pro shop.

544
00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:40.000
They came from that mill.

545
00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:41.000
All those camispins.

546
00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.000
So that top floor was destroyed.

547
00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:46.000
There was just bird's nest and shit everywhere, right?

548
00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:47.000
All over everything.

549
00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:50.000
And then they went in the middle floors.

550
00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:51.000
But he's like, let me show you something.

551
00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:52.000
I'm like, okay.

552
00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:58.000
And we follow him down this staircase and I'm like, this is going to like murder us or something.

553
00:28:58.000 --> 00:28:59.000
I don't think.

554
00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:00.000
What is going on?

555
00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:04.000
We walk in and he pulls his flash light up like this.

556
00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:07.000
And it's like a layer of dragons.

557
00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:13.000
There's got to be 67 the looms in the basement of this place.

558
00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:15.000
And that's where we pulled the shit out.

559
00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:17.000
What does it loom cost right now?

560
00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:18.000
How brand new loom?

561
00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:23.000
If we were going to go brand new probably 120 maybe.

562
00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:27.000
You know, and where'd you pay for loom number three?

563
00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:29.000
Loom number three.

564
00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:31.000
I negotiated 25 hundred bucks.

565
00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:36.000
And we'll have you buy the rest of those.

566
00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:37.000
We should.

567
00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:39.000
Dude, it's just to move on.

568
00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:41.000
It's like, they're 9,000 pounds each.

569
00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:42.000
Yeah.

570
00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:43.000
They're massive.

571
00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:45.000
Joe Joe ran the show.

572
00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:46.000
There's more juggle like the other.

573
00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:47.000
Yeah, we did.

574
00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:48.000
Double close.

575
00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:52.000
We, I told the, so anyways, we, when you go shit deal,

576
00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:56.000
I spent, I was like 10 grand and we got like a few different things.

577
00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.000
All massive machines, the warpur with the creal.

578
00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:05.000
We got a loom, uh, the, in the pro shop, the, the, the backwinding machine that I refurbished.

579
00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:07.000
That came out of there.

580
00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:17.000
And the most important thing we got out of that place was the punch card machine to punch the patterns to go in the looms.

581
00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:18.000
That's in my office.

582
00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:19.000
Yeah, that's a cured.

583
00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:20.000
We've got to walk in my face.

584
00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:26.000
So that's, that's how you actually decide what, how that loom is going to weave together the material.

585
00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:30.000
So it looks like dragon weave looks like exactly.

586
00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:33.000
So that's, that's the, that's the deal.

587
00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:38.000
I mean, that place was, and I'm still like trying to work with Mario to get more equipment.

588
00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:40.000
But yeah, let's trick you.

589
00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:44.000
Okay, so you've been, you were kind of doing that.

590
00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:45.000
You've been doing that.

591
00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:50.000
Obviously once we met, you know, you're at 12 people, you're growing.

592
00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:53.000
You, you, you obviously, I gave you a copy of Extreme Ownership.

593
00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:57.000
You read that. How is that, is that played a role? How is that played a role?

594
00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.000
Because I know you've told me it's played a role.

595
00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:02.000
Where did you see yourself going, okay, you know what?

596
00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:04.000
Here's something I need to do different.

597
00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:11.000
And I've said this, I said this on an interview the other day that, you know, someone was talking about what kind of, what they say,

598
00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:14.000
background check did I do on you before we started working together?

599
00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:15.000
Right.

600
00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:17.000
And is that what there was that there was no due diligence?

601
00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:18.000
What kind of due diligence?

602
00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:22.000
And I, you know, I was explaining how we spent a lot of time talking.

603
00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:28.000
And via Skype and what I was really listening to and hearing was, you know, you weren't making excuses about anything.

604
00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:31.000
Well, you know, you explained to me, hey, we tried to do this.

605
00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:33.000
I didn't know what I was doing.

606
00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:34.000
I had to learn that.

607
00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:37.000
Then I tried to do this other thing and guess what?

608
00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:38.000
I didn't have enough capital.

609
00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:39.000
I had to figure out another way.

610
00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:42.000
You weren't saying, you didn't blame anybody else for anything.

611
00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:46.000
I mean, and, you know, we're, we're right now in a great point with origin.

612
00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:48.000
And you weren't always at a great point.

613
00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:51.000
I mean, you've had, you've had to do whatever you bit struggling business had to do.

614
00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:53.000
Or small business has to do that is struggle to grow.

615
00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:59.000
And when I talked to you, you, you, you already had the attitude of taking ownership of everything you could.

616
00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:05.000
But I know in talking to you that you've also pulled a lot of stuff out and said, oh, yeah, this is, this is had an impact.

617
00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:06.000
Oh, yeah.

618
00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:08.000
I mean, there's tons of stuff.

619
00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:09.000
There's tons of stuff.

620
00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:15.000
You know, first of all, what you jutsu has done for me is expose me.

621
00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:16.000
It's what it does.

622
00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:18.000
It exposes your weaknesses.

623
00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:29.000
So you get better. And that mindset that you jutsu mindset, I like being exposed because our brains have changed.

624
00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:30.000
Right?

625
00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:32.000
And I think that's what makes this work.

626
00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:39.000
Like if, if, if, if, if, if I, if I don't see the weakness and somebody exposes it,

627
00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:42.000
the first thing I do is feel like a schmock for a second,

628
00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:46.000
but then I'm like, okay, well, show me how I can get better.

629
00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:50.000
You know, when there's so many times I've like texted you late night, hey, man, can you talk?

630
00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:53.000
Can you help me out with this issue? Can you help me out with this problem?

631
00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:59.000
You know, because leadership for me has only come through playing sports and then running business.

632
00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:00.000
Right?

633
00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:01.000
I wasn't in war.

634
00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:09.000
I didn't see the worst of humanity and how decisions can affect someone living or dying.

635
00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:13.000
I didn't see that, you know, and I, it's a whole not a level, you know?

636
00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:24.000
And knowing that you had had and had those leadership skills that were, you know, that you conditioned to,

637
00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:26.000
is really what it was.

638
00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:28.000
You know, I just knew there was another level.

639
00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:34.000
And so when I actually listened to extreme ownership for the first time, you know,

640
00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:41.000
I was just humbled by that, you know, by the book.

641
00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:48.000
The two things for me that really, and of course, I went to the monster too, and I'd recommend if you're in business,

642
00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:52.000
any leadership position, regardless of industry.

643
00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:53.000
Go.

644
00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:56.000
Like, and it'll be the most valuable thing you do for yourself.

645
00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:04.000
Like, it's hard to explain, but I can tell you being there in the presence, first of all, warriors,

646
00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:08.000
but also their stories is powerful.

647
00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:15.000
You know, connecting with them on a personal level outside of the monster, that's powerful.

648
00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:18.000
Decentralized command change the game for us.

649
00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:23.000
Man, you know, I didn't think I was a control freak.

650
00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:29.000
I just, I was always like, you need to bring me a better idea.

651
00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:32.000
It's got to be better than my idea, right?

652
00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:34.000
I will go with anybody's idea.

653
00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.000
It's got to be better though.

654
00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:38.000
It's got to make more sense, and I'll switch.

655
00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:41.000
I'll shut it down and switch immediately.

656
00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:49.000
But you know what I found out is I wasn't giving people an opportunity to give me their idea.

657
00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:58.000
We had a great culture, we had a great culture, but I wasn't giving them the opportunity to be leaders.

658
00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:05.000
I had kind of nurtured a kind of, I will help you decide.

659
00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:07.000
I'll help you.

660
00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:10.000
You know, you come to me and I'll help you.

661
00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:16.000
And once I shifted that, and I actually had a lot of our managers and leaders,

662
00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:24.000
listen to extreme ownership, and I'll tell you what, the ones who listened,

663
00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:30.000
I knew they would become leaders, and the ones who gave me slack about it,

664
00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:33.000
I knew there's another path for them.

665
00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:39.000
Because you have to humble yourself to listen, and then not only listen, but apply it.

666
00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:44.000
So, then I've got a little off course with the decentralized command too.

667
00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:48.000
I've given a little too much, and you know, because I can't hear your shot of fire.

668
00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:50.000
Which is the whole other thing, right?

669
00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:58.000
But then I've had to come at me like, people make decisions, but not be the right decisions.

670
00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:06.000
I don't want to have to bite my tongue about it. At the same time, I've had the leadership skewed,

671
00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:10.000
you know, like, decentralized command can be skewed from the other side.

672
00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:16.000
Well, this person needs to do this, or sometimes, like, you know, sometimes you just need to make a decision.

673
00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:20.000
Well, you can take that, and you can say, well, I'm just going to make a decision every time.

674
00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:22.000
No, that's not what we're talking about here.

675
00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:26.000
You know, so decentralized command for us changed the game.

676
00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:32.000
Well, you wouldn't be able to do, you would not be able to do anything that you're doing right now.

677
00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:37.000
If you were trying to control everything that the way you were a year and a half, two years ago, impossible.

678
00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:39.000
Exactly. And the growth.

679
00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:47.000
And I would say that the transition between growth phases, which is a lot of transition,

680
00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:51.000
has been so smooth because we're all on the same page.

681
00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:53.000
You know, we're all on the same page.

682
00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:59.000
And winning it all costs, which is a big one for me, because that's where you got a completely

683
00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:01.000
doop your ego.

684
00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:04.000
We've had some conversations about that.

685
00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:11.000
Yeah, well, and interesting. I talked about winning it all costs at the most, or I haven't really exposed it to everyone.

686
00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:17.000
But, you know, the basic concept is that when we say winning it all costs,

687
00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:22.000
we think of that from an attitude of being completely aggressive moving forward,

688
00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:24.000
not ver stopping no matter what happens.

689
00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:26.000
I'm going to execute the plan that I came up with.

690
00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:28.000
And that sounds good.

691
00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:30.000
And it gets everyone all fired up.

692
00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:34.000
But the reality is, and I'm not a fact you and I were just talking about this.

693
00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:41.000
Somebody here at camp said, basically, is it okay to quit?

694
00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:46.000
I feel like I don't want to quit, but I've got something going on.

695
00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:54.000
Basically a guy, a great guy, hard worker, has a business, been running his business.

696
00:37:54.000 --> 00:38:01.000
It was his goal was to get this business up and running a very hard business, a very labor-intensive business,

697
00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:05.000
a very fickle business, agriculture.

698
00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:08.000
And he's been grinding. He was at camp last year.

699
00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:09.000
I talked to him all last year.

700
00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:14.000
I remember I asked him a lot of questions about leadership and ownership and business, and all that.

701
00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:20.000
He comes back this year and he came to me this morning.

702
00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:24.000
And really, I think this, I told him this, this conversation that we had made it,

703
00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:28.000
feel like it was worthwhile for me to come to camp because he said to me,

704
00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:34.000
I feel like, is it ever okay to quit?

705
00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:37.000
I know I'm not supposed to, he was in the Marine Corps.

706
00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:39.000
We don't quit.

707
00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:42.000
And I said, if you listen to all the podcast, then he goes,

708
00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:45.000
yeah, and I go, because I answered this question.

709
00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:47.000
I answered this question.

710
00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:50.000
The question is, is it ever okay to quit?

711
00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:52.000
And so you and I just had this conversation.

712
00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:54.000
And you said, need direct reaction.

713
00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:56.000
You read your, read your reactions.

714
00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:57.000
No, you can never quit.

715
00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:59.000
No, I come from the Seal teams.

716
00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:02.000
Where our motto is actually never quit.

717
00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:06.000
That's actually one of our mantras.

718
00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:11.000
And then I said, okay, Pete, if you came up with a plan,

719
00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:15.000
that was driving our business into the ground,

720
00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:17.000
but you were just never going to quit.

721
00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:18.000
Would that be good?

722
00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:20.000
No, you're like, no, okay, there you go.

723
00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:21.000
Yeah, that's a lot of it.

724
00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:23.000
It does more trickster.

725
00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:24.000
Yeah, well, trickster.

726
00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:26.000
I'm a little trickster.

727
00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:27.000
So, so that's the problem.

728
00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:30.000
If you have something that is, that is like that,

729
00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:32.000
that whether it's hey, I want you to charge,

730
00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:34.000
singa, nest, or whether it's,

731
00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:37.000
hey, I want you to continue to execute this plan,

732
00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:40.000
or whether it's, hey, I want you to even something like this.

733
00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:44.000
Hey, you should keep training hard, right?

734
00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:45.000
Guess what?

735
00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:46.000
My knees a little bit tweaked.

736
00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:47.000
Don't quit.

737
00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:48.000
Well, now you blow your knee out.

738
00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:49.000
Right.

739
00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:52.000
So, the fact of the matter is, sometimes you got to look at,

740
00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:56.000
so then I said, okay, what is your long term strategic goal?

741
00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:58.000
Like your actual strategic goal.

742
00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:03.000
Because his goal was, the goal of his was not to build that business.

743
00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:05.000
The goal of his was to be able to take care of his family

744
00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:08.000
and be around his family and do something with his family

745
00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:10.000
that he could carry on as a legacy.

746
00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:11.000
That was his goal.

747
00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:12.000
It wasn't working out.

748
00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:15.000
The business part of it wasn't working out.

749
00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:17.000
I don't know what he's going to do,

750
00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:20.000
but I can tell you, I saw him an hour later

751
00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:22.000
and he had a big smile on his face.

752
00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:24.000
And I said, you feel lighter, don't you?

753
00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:27.000
And he goes, yes, I do feel lighter.

754
00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:28.000
That, thank you.

755
00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:32.000
But the point is, not that he's necessarily going to stop,

756
00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:36.000
but he's going to maybe shift his direction a little bit

757
00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:39.000
or he's going to attack it with a different perspective.

758
00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:40.000
He's going to do something different.

759
00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:42.000
He realized, man, we talked about this in two, two all the time.

760
00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:43.000
Yeah.

761
00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:44.000
I just got done teaching the white belts.

762
00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:48.000
I'm like, the knee shield, you're not going to go through it.

763
00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:49.000
You can't go through it.

764
00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:50.000
You cannot go through it.

765
00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:52.000
It's humanly impossible.

766
00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:54.000
You cannot go through the knee shield.

767
00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:55.000
You have to go around it.

768
00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:56.000
You have to go under it.

769
00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:57.000
You have to back away from it.

770
00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:58.000
You've got to do something else.

771
00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:00.000
So if I say go through that knee shield

772
00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:02.000
and you just go forward forward forward

773
00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:03.000
and you never quit.

774
00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:04.000
Guess how long you're going to be there.

775
00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:05.000
Forever.

776
00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:07.000
You can't physically move your hips on your hips.

777
00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:08.000
Yes.

778
00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:10.000
So this idea of like never quitting.

779
00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:12.000
It's something that we have to be careful about.

780
00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:16.000
We have to be careful that what we're not quitting is something strategic.

781
00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:18.000
And we have to continually check that that strategy,

782
00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:22.000
that strategic goal that we're moving towards is actually something that we don't.

783
00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:26.000
I had this conversation with Dave several years ago about echelon front

784
00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:30.000
and he was like, oh, you know, we got to expand.

785
00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:32.000
And I said, yeah, absolutely, we got to expand.

786
00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:34.000
And we were talking about how we were going to do it.

787
00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:38.000
And we started looking at like how many gigs and how many numbers and how many things

788
00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:40.000
and how many events and how many companies were going to be in.

789
00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:42.000
And I said, let me ask you this.

790
00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:47.000
Why do we want to expand in that manner?

791
00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:52.000
Is that really what we want is to expand in that way.

792
00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:54.000
And we thought about it.

793
00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:57.000
And it's like, no, actually we want to do something a lot smarter than that.

794
00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:59.000
So we quit.

795
00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:01.000
Basically you adapted.

796
00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:02.000
We adapted.

797
00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:06.000
But we did we we adapted, but I mean to look at it in the blunt language,

798
00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:08.000
I like, oh, we quit this direction.

799
00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:09.000
But that's fine.

800
00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:10.000
Now, let me too.

801
00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:12.000
It is the we didn't quit.

802
00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:16.000
We didn't quit the strategic goal of growing, of spreading the word,

803
00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:21.000
of helping people learn, of bringing leaders up to their, their potential.

804
00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:22.000
That's what the goal is.

805
00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:25.000
The goal isn't, hey, we want to have X amount of clients.

806
00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:29.000
We would rather have the clients that really adopt what we say,

807
00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:32.000
that really absorb what we say, that we can really have an impact on.

808
00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:34.000
That's what we're looking to do.

809
00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:38.000
So yeah, those kind of things are important to consider.

810
00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:42.000
And I know, I know that's some of the conversations that we've had about

811
00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:43.000
winning at all costs.

812
00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:48.000
So winning at all costs means sometimes you do things that on the surface,

813
00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:51.000
they don't seem like winning moves.

814
00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:52.000
I know.

815
00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:54.000
You know, it's, it was crazy.

816
00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:57.000
My wife read an extreme ownership.

817
00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:00.000
She devoured it, but watch out now, boy.

818
00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:01.000
Oh, man.

819
00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:07.000
You know, and sometimes, you know, 99% of the time she applies it.

820
00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:12.000
But sometimes she'll say to me, I just don't feel like playing your game today.

821
00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:14.000
You ever heard that?

822
00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:16.000
Not for my wife.

823
00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:17.000
No.

824
00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:18.000
Well, I mean, I work with my wife.

825
00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:19.000
We have a great work.

826
00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:21.000
And actually, that's something that we should talk about,

827
00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:23.000
because you do have a great work in relationship with your wife.

828
00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:25.000
I hear you on the phone.

829
00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:31.000
And that is basically her saying, like, I don't know what she's trying to say,

830
00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:34.000
but I do what you do in extreme ownership.

831
00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:35.000
I'll do it.

832
00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:36.000
Yeah.

833
00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:40.000
With some of the toughest conversations will be like,

834
00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:43.000
it's six o'clock or seven o'clock,

835
00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:47.000
and she's still working to make sure we win it all costs.

836
00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:51.000
She's actually physically shipping product with the rest of the team.

837
00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:55.000
And she'll work to probably 10 to do that on occasion.

838
00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:57.000
And I'll walk out and I'll be like, how's it going?

839
00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:01.000
She's like good, and I'll be like, I haven't trained this week.

840
00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:03.000
I was thinking about going to train.

841
00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:06.000
And then she'll give me the look.

842
00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:10.000
That's not me winning at all costs.

843
00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:14.000
And it's kind of like one of those things you've got to balance,

844
00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:18.000
like, what's the most important thing here to make happen?

845
00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:24.000
But at the same time, when she's in the game,

846
00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:27.000
she'll be like, I know you need that.

847
00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:29.000
So I will handle this.

848
00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:32.000
And then it's kind of like you scratch my back.

849
00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:33.000
I'll scratch yours.

850
00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:36.000
In the military, it's called a mutually supporting relationship.

851
00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:37.000
Mutuality is what it's called.

852
00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:39.000
You're going to take care of me this time.

853
00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:41.000
And tomorrow, I got you.

854
00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:42.000
Yeah.

855
00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:44.000
You know, when you're all sore from you train last night,

856
00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:45.000
guess what?

857
00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:46.000
You can get in here and stay late night.

858
00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:47.000
Exactly.

859
00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:48.000
Exactly.

860
00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:49.000
You'll do something relaxing.

861
00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:50.000
Exactly.

862
00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:56.000
But you know, there's occasions where like winning it all costs is like,

863
00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:00.000
it really is sometimes you're just like thinking,

864
00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:03.000
oh man, I have to, I've got a freaking do this, bro.

865
00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:05.000
I've got to, I got it with you.

866
00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:08.000
It's like, I'll go in my office and I'll sit down and I'll put my hands

867
00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:10.000
on the desk and I'll just put my head down and close my eyes,

868
00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:13.000
but like reset, go.

869
00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:15.000
And then just go do it.

870
00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:17.000
Yeah, just move.

871
00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:19.000
I had this conversation with another camper up here.

872
00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:23.000
That was like, you know, I love extreme ownership,

873
00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:26.000
but one of my friends has had trouble with it.

874
00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:29.000
And I said, oh, what type of trouble?

875
00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:31.000
Have they had with extreme ownership?

876
00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:35.000
Well, they're trying, he's trying to get his team to take ownership

877
00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:38.000
and they're not taking ownership.

878
00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:41.000
And I said, okay, more, expand.

879
00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:44.000
And basically, it's like, oh, the team mess something up.

880
00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:47.000
And he's like, you guys got to take ownership with it and fix it.

881
00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:50.000
And in your mind, you're thinking, oh, I'm going to get them to take ownership.

882
00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:52.000
That's the problem.

883
00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:53.000
That's the problem.

884
00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:55.000
The real, just so everybody knows.

885
00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:56.000
Yeah.

886
00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:59.000
The real thing that you do is you say, oh, I see that you guys failed

887
00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:00.000
on the project.

888
00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:03.000
I obviously let you down.

889
00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:05.000
I obviously didn't give you clear enough guidance.

890
00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:07.000
I didn't explain it to you well enough.

891
00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:09.000
I didn't give you the resources that you need.

892
00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:11.000
I didn't, and you don't say this part,

893
00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:13.000
I didn't micromanage you enough.

894
00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:14.000
That's exactly.

895
00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:16.000
Because when you start saying, okay, I'm going to come in.

896
00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:18.000
I'm going to make sure we get that don't, hey, you know what?

897
00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:22.000
I only met with you three times over three weeks during that project.

898
00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:23.000
That's my fault.

899
00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:27.000
Now we're going to meet every day because I want to make sure that we're tracking.

900
00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:28.000
Yeah.

901
00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:30.000
And if you do that, you can will stuff to happen.

902
00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:32.000
I mean, you can make things happen through force of will.

903
00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:35.000
And so in that situation where you get down there, you get to meet every day.

904
00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:36.000
You're going to check at the end of the day.

905
00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:38.000
You're going to make sure that we're making progress on the project.

906
00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:39.000
That we're supposed to.

907
00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:42.000
And your team now goes, oh, damn, we don't want this.

908
00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:43.000
We're going to go back off.

909
00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:45.000
And then you know what they just did?

910
00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:46.000
They took ownership.

911
00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:47.000
Exactly.

912
00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:55.000
And you know what I have to be very careful of, though, is because of the fragility of human resources,

913
00:46:55.000 --> 00:47:01.000
which are also in our culture, it's our family too, is saying the word failure.

914
00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:07.000
You know, and, and I think the thing is, and where the transition happens is when you

915
00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:14.000
understand that in what I'm trying to get, like a man to understand is that extreme ownership

916
00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:16.000
is it's not a game.

917
00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:18.000
It's actually a way of thinking.

918
00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:20.000
And you really have to believe that.

919
00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:23.000
So when you're saying, hey, I gave you too much.

920
00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:26.000
I gave you, I gave you so much.

921
00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:28.000
There's absolutely no way you could handle that.

922
00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:34.000
I failed you by asking you to do that.

923
00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:37.000
The words coming out of your mouth, you have to believe.

924
00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:42.000
A lot of people will say it, but they don't believe it, and lately they don't believe it, totally.

925
00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:48.000
And that is, that is the ego, and that is actually getting it, and you have to take yourself,

926
00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:50.000
and you have to put yourself in their shoes.

927
00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:56.000
And if you can't detach and do that, then you are playing the game.

928
00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:58.000
You're playing the game, and it's not a game.

929
00:47:58.000 --> 00:47:59.000
It's not a game.

930
00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:03.000
And I've said this one before where someone says, you know, when I get in front of my team and I say,

931
00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:04.000
hey, guys, this was my fault.

932
00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:05.000
This happens.

933
00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:08.000
And then someone on the team goes, yeah, it was your fault.

934
00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:11.000
And you know, when I ask, oh, I ask groups, I'll ask companies that.

935
00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:12.000
I say, what do you say to that?

936
00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:15.000
And people get all like, they get confused.

937
00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:18.000
They say, well, you should tell them about what the mistakes that they made.

938
00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:19.000
So they can do it.

939
00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:23.000
And it's like, no, what you actually say is, when someone, when you say, hey, this was my fault.

940
00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:25.000
They say, yeah, it is your fault.

941
00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:27.000
And you say, I know that's what I just said.

942
00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:29.000
It is absolutely my fault.

943
00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:30.000
Here's the mistakes that I made.

944
00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:32.000
Here's what I'm going to do to fix them.

945
00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:33.000
So we do better next time.

946
00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:37.000
I usually just say, I won't let you down again.

947
00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:38.000
I'll make sure this doesn't happen.

948
00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:39.000
Yeah.

949
00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:41.000
I was down there fixing a loon the other day.

950
00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:42.000
Yeah.

951
00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:42.000
You're dead.

952
00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:43.000
You're about that?

953
00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:44.000
No.

954
00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:45.000
Our loon tech.

955
00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:47.000
You know how you asked about when we first started working together, you're like, well, proud.

956
00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:52.000
What if what if something happens to one of these old timers that helps you with the machinery?

957
00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:55.000
And I was like, we find a way.

958
00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:58.000
How many moving parts are on a loom?

959
00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:00.000
There's got to be 10,000.

960
00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:08.000
It looks like the most insane contraption that looks like when you look at one and you see it moving.

961
00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:11.000
You think yourself, there's no way that this works.

962
00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:14.000
There's millions of little like needles.

963
00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:15.000
What are they?

964
00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:16.000
A little hooks or something hooks.

965
00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:17.000
It's a little crazy.

966
00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:26.000
We were our so-called any our loom guy who got a set up with everything and re-ferbered everything.

967
00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:29.000
And what I say, we bought a loom for 2500 bucks.

968
00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:32.000
I mean, like, we got a frame for 2500.

969
00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:33.000
It's like getting a car frame.

970
00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:35.000
But now we're going to build a car.

971
00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:39.000
So, you know, it costs money to get these things back up and going.

972
00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:43.000
And most importantly knowledge, because we have to have all the parts machined from scratch that

973
00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:45.000
They don't make anymore.

974
00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:49.000
And then you spend 10 grand on parts that you hadn't machined and they don't work.

975
00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:52.000
And that's why loon number three still down.

976
00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:54.000
What you're saying?

977
00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:59.000
You know, fairly such a great story.

978
00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:00.000
So, those are work.

979
00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:05.000
Yeah, we actually, on my podcast, we just talked about if we made the right decision.

980
00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:07.000
You have to listen to that.

981
00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:12.000
Did we make the right decision or should we have gone and gotten a note in span of

982
00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:17.000
quarter million dollars or new looms and waited the six months for the build out to get the looms.

983
00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:21.000
And so anyways, letting us sick.

984
00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:26.000
And he's the old time or he used to work in the baits mill to weave, you know, the huge mill.

985
00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:27.000
He was the one.

986
00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:35.000
He got sick and I could tell that my team was, let's say, failing.

987
00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:38.000
And that was one of those times recently.

988
00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:42.000
That's about a month ago where I sat in my seat and I just kind of was like,

989
00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:44.000
This isn't working.

990
00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:46.000
And it's not going to work.

991
00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:50.000
If you don't drag your ass downstairs into the bunker.

992
00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:53.000
Into the fallout shelter because that's where these things are.

993
00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:59.000
Into the dragons layer and fix it and show them there is a way to fix it.

994
00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:01.000
Go hands on it.

995
00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:06.000
So we went down there and we started stripping things apart completely apart.

996
00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:09.000
And figuring it out.

997
00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:15.000
And after a solid seven to 10 days,

998
00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:21.000
we got it back up and running.

999
00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:25.000
And you know what that did to that team at 21 year old?

1000
00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:27.000
Oh, I actually know what it did.

1001
00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:28.000
Go ahead.

1002
00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:29.000
No, you tell me.

1003
00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:33.000
Well, people ask me all the time, what can we do to make our team tighter?

1004
00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:37.000
And I say, if you want your team to be tighter, if you want to have better morale,

1005
00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:40.000
do hard things together.

1006
00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:42.000
Do hard things together.

1007
00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:44.000
It raises everyone's confidence.

1008
00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:46.000
It brings everyone together on the team.

1009
00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:48.000
It makes you feel like you got over something.

1010
00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:50.000
A lot of companies that I work with now.

1011
00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:53.000
Our companies that survived the economic downturn.

1012
00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:55.000
And they talk about it like they went to war.

1013
00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:58.000
And they survived and now we're tight and we're bros and nothing's ever going to

1014
00:51:58.000 --> 00:51:59.000
rest part.

1015
00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:02.000
Yeah, I'm getting the chills when you just thinking about that.

1016
00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:05.000
That recession was war on business.

1017
00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:06.000
Yeah.

1018
00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:10.000
The military units, what makes a military unit have morale?

1019
00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:13.000
Well, you put them through boot camp and they go through hard things together.

1020
00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:16.000
And then you take a special operations unit.

1021
00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:18.000
You put them through tougher training.

1022
00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:20.000
And it makes them even tighter.

1023
00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:25.000
And then when you take a unit, a conventional force unit or a spec option unit,

1024
00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:29.000
and you put them into combat, they're going to get even tighter.

1025
00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:32.000
And the harder the combat, the tighter they get.

1026
00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:37.000
So you and your crew spending seven days, 12 hour days,

1027
00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:41.000
trying to figure out this significant problem and overcoming it.

1028
00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:44.000
It brings you, it brings us tighter together.

1029
00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:50.000
And like you're 21 year old kid that's learning how to do this.

1030
00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:51.000
I don't know I'm calling the kid.

1031
00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:54.000
He's a man with a job, making stuff happen.

1032
00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:57.000
He feels, alright, I've got value.

1033
00:52:57.000 --> 00:52:58.000
I've got confidence.

1034
00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:01.000
I can, this machine, this machine doesn't run me.

1035
00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:02.000
I run this machine.

1036
00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:03.000
Exactly.

1037
00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:05.000
And you know what was funny is when?

1038
00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:08.000
Like there's a, people are looking at it.

1039
00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:12.000
People are looking for like, what's the, how are we going to solve this?

1040
00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:13.000
And I have this rule.

1041
00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:20.000
It's, it's basically ask me once, ask me twice, ask me a third time.

1042
00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:22.000
I'm doing something wrong.

1043
00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:27.000
And what had happened with the loom because I knew what a nightmare was going to be.

1044
00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:31.000
Is, I decentralized from it too much.

1045
00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:37.000
So they were in my office over the course of the first two to three days.

1046
00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:41.000
It might even been a week at least a dozen times.

1047
00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:44.000
So you're red flag for you need it.

1048
00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:48.000
You're too far detached from something is ask once you're not too far to doubt.

1049
00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:49.000
It's just just an issue.

1050
00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:50.000
Ask twice.

1051
00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:51.000
Details.

1052
00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:52.000
I left the detail.

1053
00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:52.000
Yeah.

1054
00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:53.000
Okay.

1055
00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:53.000
Here's a little bit more.

1056
00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:54.000
Third time.

1057
00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:55.000
Got to get them going.

1058
00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:55.000
Yeah.

1059
00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:56.000
Got to make something happen.

1060
00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:57.000
And that's just my own.

1061
00:53:57.000 --> 00:53:59.000
And I think that that helps like, just helps.

1062
00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:00.000
For sure.

1063
00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:01.000
For sure.

1064
00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:04.000
Somebody, if I'm in a combat situation, someone calls me up and say, hey,

1065
00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:08.000
I'm saying, hey, Joaqua, we got movers over there and I'm like, no, we're good.

1066
00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:09.000
They call me again.

1067
00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:10.000
Hey, I think I see something.

1068
00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:12.000
No, there's nothing to be in track.

1069
00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:14.000
Hey, we got some situation down here.

1070
00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:15.000
Guess what?

1071
00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:16.000
I'm going to go find out what's going on.

1072
00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:18.000
And you know what the other thing is?

1073
00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:21.000
Like, what to that end is we were sitting in the golf cart together.

1074
00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:23.000
They didn't know I was in the phone with Jill.

1075
00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:25.000
And she called me and we're at camp right now.

1076
00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:27.000
And the emergency, or an emergency camp.

1077
00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:29.000
And she called me and she's like, hey,

1078
00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:33.000
the cover stitch, we're spending the sheeness down for you.

1079
00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:36.000
You know, our last, our last, the waistband.

1080
00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:39.000
And I said, okay, did you call Bill?

1081
00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:42.000
And she's like, yes, but he can't come in.

1082
00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:43.000
That's it.

1083
00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:44.000
Let me call him.

1084
00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:45.000
She said, okay, come.

1085
00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:46.000
Bill, can you come in?

1086
00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:48.000
I can't come into a one.

1087
00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:49.000
That's good enough.

1088
00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:50.000
But you can be there today.

1089
00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:51.000
So yes, I called Jill.

1090
00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:57.000
I said, hey, I need you to ask if Maggie, which is one of our stitches,

1091
00:54:57.000 --> 00:54:59.000
can stay late.

1092
00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:02.000
So that she builds going to come in and fix the machine.

1093
00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:05.000
So that she can get production done.

1094
00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:07.000
What does that do to Jill?

1095
00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:10.000
Let me dig a little deeper into that machine.

1096
00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:13.000
So when we showed up at the factory the other day, everything was back up and going

1097
00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:14.000
without Bill.

1098
00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:16.000
So at the same time, not that flank.

1099
00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:18.000
And I've learned a lot about flanking.

1100
00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:20.000
I would have driven over there.

1101
00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:21.000
I wouldn't let the session.

1102
00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:25.000
But showing her that somebody else is going to be half the be put out.

1103
00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:26.000
I'm going to be put out.

1104
00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:28.000
Bill's going to be a little put out.

1105
00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:30.000
Maggie's going to be put out because she asked to work late.

1106
00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:33.000
So there's three people that are willing and ready.

1107
00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:38.000
And there's one that probably could just dig a little bit deeper to see what the problem is

1108
00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:39.000
and come to find out.

1109
00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:41.000
She fixed it.

1110
00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:44.000
And Jill getting it done.

1111
00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:44.000
Yeah.

1112
00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:48.000
So is, you know, it's just, and she and I'm sure, and I haven't talked to her yet.

1113
00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:52.000
I haven't seen her since then, but I'm sure she thought about that.

1114
00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:56.000
And learned from it because she's listened to extreme ownership.

1115
00:55:56.000 --> 00:55:58.000
And she can't wait for the next book that caught me on the leadership.

1116
00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:01.000
But she's listened and read and she listens to your podcast.

1117
00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:03.000
And everybody in the factory listens to the podcast.

1118
00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:05.000
We've got Cindy up in shipping.

1119
00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:06.000
Who's like, she's got it on.

1120
00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:07.000
She's got it on.

1121
00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:07.000
She's got it on.

1122
00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:08.000
She's like, what?

1123
00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:09.000
She's like, what?

1124
00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:11.000
I'm listening to the track.

1125
00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:14.000
And I'm like, okay, you keep talking up there.

1126
00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:16.000
So I spoke by the river there.

1127
00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:17.000
And she's like, look at my setup.

1128
00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:21.000
She's got like four YouTube tabs open.

1129
00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:22.000
Dockle podcast.

1130
00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:23.000
Dockle podcast.

1131
00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:25.000
She's not listening to four.

1132
00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:27.000
It wants, but she might start doing that.

1133
00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:28.000
She's got that.

1134
00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:29.000
She's very big down.

1135
00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:33.000
So in a lot of the staff listens to the podcast.

1136
00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:42.000
And I get a lot of questions from them about because leadership is a skill that is,

1137
00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:46.000
it's acquired through practice.

1138
00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:51.000
You know, people I used to believe, I don't know if I've chosen, I used to believe that you were born

1139
00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:52.000
leader.

1140
00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:53.000
You ever heard that?

1141
00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:55.000
I have, and I've discussed this before.

1142
00:56:55.000 --> 00:57:01.000
There is, you are born with some leadership qualities, some of them are good, some of them are

1143
00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:02.000
bad.

1144
00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:03.000
You can improve.

1145
00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:04.000
Oh, yeah.

1146
00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:07.000
And the more you pay attention to it, the more you will improve.

1147
00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:09.000
The only one person that can improve their leadership.

1148
00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:11.000
And that's the person who lacks humility.

1149
00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:12.000
Yeah.

1150
00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:14.000
If they lack humility, they're not going to get any better.

1151
00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:16.000
Because they're not doing anything wrong.

1152
00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:17.000
And they're mine.

1153
00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:18.000
They're not doing anything wrong.

1154
00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:23.000
You know what the hardest thing though is, at the factory, is we have a lot of different

1155
00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:28.000
life of folks from different walks of life.

1156
00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:32.000
But this is old New England.

1157
00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:38.000
It's not quite the New England we're talking about, but there's a lot of parallels because

1158
00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:42.000
of the recession and the lack of jobs and the lack of factories.

1159
00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:47.000
So for the folks who didn't go to college and I don't even think, I'm going to say right

1160
00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:52.000
out, like, I haven't said to my kids which college are you going to.

1161
00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:55.000
I've asked them many times what would you like to do.

1162
00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:59.000
But I'm not one of those parents who's like, which college you going to?

1163
00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:01.000
And I think that's okay too.

1164
00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:06.000
I'm not saying it's not, I've seen both ends of the spectrum from my own experience.

1165
00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:09.000
And I don't want to pressure them to go into the trades.

1166
00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:12.000
It's great money that you know, in all these different opportunities, especially with the

1167
00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:13.000
resurgence of manufacturing.

1168
00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:16.000
It's going to be so many opportunities.

1169
00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:21.000
But these people from the different walks of life, sometimes they are finding their

1170
00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:26.000
value in life by doing this work they're doing.

1171
00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:36.000
And what I found is something I didn't know existed and discovered is that they make the

1172
00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:40.000
product together as a community.

1173
00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:43.000
And that product goes to the consumer and in the past that ended.

1174
00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:45.000
Those two things there was one and there was the other.

1175
00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:50.000
Now the person who puts their hands on it on this end and the person who puts their hand on it on

1176
00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:56.000
the other end have a relationship because of new media, because of social media.

1177
00:58:56.000 --> 00:58:59.000
And so they don't just get fulfillment by making the product.

1178
00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:05.000
They also get fulfillment by seeing that product being used and being appreciated.

1179
00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:12.000
And with extreme ownership when this person here on this end, they're the worker, the worker.

1180
00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:17.000
They're finding that they find their being and they find so much value.

1181
00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:20.000
It's like it's a powerful thing.

1182
00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:26.000
I have to be very careful in my own leadership ways not to take that away from them.

1183
00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:31.000
And so that approach has got to be perfect person.

1184
00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:34.000
So I have to shift the way I talked to people.

1185
00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:36.000
I got to shift.

1186
00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:44.000
I can have like 25 conversations and I would have it 25 different ways depending on who the person is.

1187
00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:47.000
And you learned that by practice.

1188
00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:48.000
Yep.

1189
00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:56.000
So speaking of too much ownership and the dichotomy of extreme ownership because there is one.

1190
00:59:56.000 --> 01:00:02.000
You got, I got you one of the copies of the new book, dichotomy of leadership.

1191
01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:06.000
Where deck fall out in your brain?

1192
01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:09.000
Well I sat down.

1193
01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
I'm not a big reader.

1194
01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:15.000
I mean because it was an audio book, I got the paper copy.

1195
01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:23.000
So I sat down on a dock, on a little cabin on the lake.

1196
01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:27.000
And I sat down and everybody was around me and I was just in it.

1197
01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
And it sucked me in.

1198
01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:32.000
And I've never had a book sucked me in.

1199
01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:33.000
Dang.

1200
01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:34.000
Yeah.

1201
01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:40.000
So it's the first one I ever got sucked into and all of a sudden I looked up and the sun was going down behind the mountains.

1202
01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
And everybody was gone.

1203
01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
I was like, what happened?

1204
01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:49.000
And you know it's one, I'm going to tell you like extreme ownership.

1205
01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:52.000
Everybody needs to read or listen to.

1206
01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:59.000
dichotomy of leadership is actually going to correct your brain.

1207
01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:03.000
Like you think you know because you read that book.

1208
01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:06.000
Now it's time for us to tweak what you're thinking.

1209
01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:10.000
So it's powerful.

1210
01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:16.000
And I think for anybody like my little sister and my brother-in-law, their ed tax and their,

1211
01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
it's, they're in a whole different game.

1212
01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
You know they're working with children.

1213
01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:23.000
It's just so valuable.

1214
01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:24.000
It's life lessons.

1215
01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:30.000
You know something I realized so as Lafin, I've been talking about why we wrote the book, the dichotomy of leadership.

1216
01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
Why we picked that topic.

1217
01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:38.000
And what we've been saying is most of the questions that we would get asked would be about the dichotomy of leadership.

1218
01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
That's completely true.

1219
01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:44.000
But I'll tell you on top of that, more important.

1220
01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:51.000
Most of the answers that I give are that there's a dichotomy in leadership and you need to be balanced.

1221
01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:54.000
That is what you, even today I got asked at camp.

1222
01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
Hey, Jocco.

1223
01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:59.000
I'm a white belt, but I want to be default aggressive.

1224
01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:02.000
But I also hear you tell me to relax all the time.

1225
01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:03.000
Which one is it?

1226
01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:04.000
What do you want me to do?

1227
01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
Should I be default aggressive and get after it?

1228
01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:07.000
Yeah.

1229
01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:12.000
Or you, you tell me relax and I actually, you know, I say relax harger, right?

1230
01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
You try to relax harger.

1231
01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:15.000
Which one do you want me to do?

1232
01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
And I said, well, luckily in Lafin, they're two.

1233
01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:18.000
I'm like, left, luckily.

1234
01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:22.000
For this very reason, Lafin, I just wrote a book called The dichotomy of leadership.

1235
01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
And there's a dichotomy with aggression.

1236
01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
Even though I say default aggressive and I say,

1237
01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:29.000
that's got to be your mindset, that's got to be your default bonus.

1238
01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
You're going to be aggressive and you're going to go get after it.

1239
01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:35.000
And there's a chapter in the book that doesn't mean that you run to your death.

1240
01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:41.000
You have to balance that with caution, with energy conservation,

1241
01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:46.000
with not wasting movement on the mat, with not wasting capital in business,

1242
01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:51.000
without burning bridges, like all those things you have to be balanced.

1243
01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:54.000
And that's why I think like you, that's a great way of putting it.

1244
01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:58.000
It's going to, it's going to recalibrate and fix your brains.

1245
01:02:58.000 --> 01:02:59.000
Yes.

1246
01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:02.000
I've had a lot of these conversations with Be Little, you know?

1247
01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:03.000
Okay.

1248
01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:06.000
Because he's a different beast than I am.

1249
01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
I'm pretty passive.

1250
01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:11.000
Like, do your job, do it right.

1251
01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
Like, I'll help anywhere I can.

1252
01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:14.000
And that's just in general, right?

1253
01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:15.000
Like, I'm there.

1254
01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:16.000
Like, I'm there.

1255
01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
I'm always on contact me any time a day.

1256
01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:22.000
And so Be Little's in a leadership position.

1257
01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:25.000
Sometimes like, jacos says, you ever get that?

1258
01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000
Jacos says.

1259
01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:28.000
Oh, yeah.

1260
01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:32.000
So the jacos says thing in, you know, jacos says default aggressive.

1261
01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
Jacos says this.

1262
01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:39.000
And the idea isn't that in your brain, you're thinking,

1263
01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
jacos says.

1264
01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:45.000
The idea is that you, you, you rewire your brain so that

1265
01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:49.000
in neatly, you're saying something and not thinking about what

1266
01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:53.000
Jacos would say, you know, you want to make it your own.

1267
01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:56.000
And that's a real ownership when we're talking about a little bit of a real

1268
01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:00.000
ownership is that you're not just saying it, but you're understanding what you're

1269
01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
saying and why you're saying it.

1270
01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:06.000
And the words are coming not as a game, but as truth because that's what you

1271
01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:07.000
believe in.

1272
01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:10.000
And that I think takes a long time for people.

1273
01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:15.000
I thought where you're going with the jacos says is when, when the

1274
01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:20.000
subordinate uses your name to make something happen, right?

1275
01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:21.000
Exactly.

1276
01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:22.000
Exactly.

1277
01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
Hey, well, hey, Jacos, this is where we're going to do things.

1278
01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:25.000
And it's like, okay, well, that's not.

1279
01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
Why do you need to say that?

1280
01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
That's the same as saying I don't rank you.

1281
01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
That's the same as saying, look, exactly.

1282
01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:32.000
I don't rank you.

1283
01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:33.000
And just what we're going to do it.

1284
01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
Hey, Jacos said that's what he wants.

1285
01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:36.000
It doesn't make any sense.

1286
01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:37.000
Jacos said that's what he wants.

1287
01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:38.000
Like you can't do that.

1288
01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:39.000
You can't do that.

1289
01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:42.000
You can't use your boss's name as your authority.

1290
01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:46.000
If what your boss has told you to make happen doesn't make sense.

1291
01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:49.000
And you can't explain why it makes sense.

1292
01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:52.000
You need to go to back to your boss and say hey boss, I'm having some trouble here.

1293
01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
Can you explain to me why we're doing it this way?

1294
01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:58.000
So I can explain that down the chain of command to the troops and it's going on in the field.

1295
01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
And you know what else is real important?

1296
01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:11.000
And I believe that I think I took away this year is like the 70 30, the 80 20, the 90 10.

1297
01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:25.000
If if if there's a decision that needs to be made in and someone else is 70% there and you're the leader and in your mind you're 90% there.

1298
01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:26.000
What do you do?

1299
01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:27.000
Yep.

1300
01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:28.000
All day long.

1301
01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:33.000
Because 70% and that has been a hard lesson for me.

1302
01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:34.000
Yeah.

1303
01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:35.000
But I'm getting it.

1304
01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
Did I tell you about the fabric the other day?

1305
01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:38.000
No.

1306
01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:43.000
I went down Friday because I was like hey we got it got the factory.

1307
01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:46.000
We got you know 400 people coming to the factory from all over the world.

1308
01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
I want this place to look tight.

1309
01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:54.000
And I walked down the spiral staircase into the bunker and we have the the dumpster the daily dump right.

1310
01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:58.000
And in the dumpster is these fabric rolls.

1311
01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:03.000
And there's like you know 10 or 20 yards on each one.

1312
01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:04.000
And John was there.

1313
01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:07.000
He's he's overseeing and he was our first employee.

1314
01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:08.000
And he knows the process.

1315
01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:09.000
He knows the factory.

1316
01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:12.000
And he's overseeing everything.

1317
01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:17.000
And I told Ryan, make sure this the other day.

1318
01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:22.000
I put my hand on the fabric and I had this attachment to it.

1319
01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:25.000
It's like five was like padding it.

1320
01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
And I was like okay what am I doing?

1321
01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:28.000
What am I doing?

1322
01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
And I look up and I go John has it.

1323
01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
Why is this fabric in the dumpster?

1324
01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:35.000
It was the first fabric we made.

1325
01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
That's why I have an attachment to it.

1326
01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:40.000
He's like it had to go.

1327
01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
And I was like.

1328
01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:43.000
Yeah.

1329
01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000
Why being the tear from my eye?

1330
01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:48.000
I'm like how do I handle this situation?

1331
01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:54.000
I'm thinking why didn't he cut off a yard or like a like why is it in the dumpster?

1332
01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:59.000
And I didn't want to pull it out of the dumpster because it didn't on an overall what he has decision he made.

1333
01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
He said Pete, you said.

1334
01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:06.000
You know how many times we've cut that by accident because it's a white.

1335
01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:13.000
And how much time we've wasted doing that and moving it around every time we need to get something.

1336
01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:16.000
I said yes.

1337
01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:26.000
And he's like I had so I threw it away and I go okay as I kind of like stroke my hand along the dumpster and kept walking even the factory.

1338
01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
It was a 50 50.

1339
01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:32.000
It wasn't a 70 30 20 is a 50 50.

1340
01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:37.000
I wanted to go back down that night and pull it all out of the dumpster before the truck came in the morning.

1341
01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:38.000
I didn't.

1342
01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
I just left it and you know what?

1343
01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:41.000
It felt great.

1344
01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:42.000
Why?

1345
01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:43.000
Because we don't need it.

1346
01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:44.000
Yeah.

1347
01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:45.000
We don't need it.

1348
01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:46.000
He's right.

1349
01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:47.000
We don't freaking need that fabric.

1350
01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:50.000
You know if I wanted to weave fabric like that we have the knowledge base.

1351
01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:51.000
We can weave fabric like that.

1352
01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:52.000
Doesn't matter.

1353
01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:53.000
Right.

1354
01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:54.000
What is it matter?

1355
01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:57.000
Because it's I have this emotional attachment to it because it was the first fabric we would.

1356
01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:58.000
What?

1357
01:07:58.000 --> 01:07:59.000
What?

1358
01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:00.000
Whatever.

1359
01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:01.000
It's gone.

1360
01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:02.000
I'm good.

1361
01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:03.000
Move on.

1362
01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000
I had to let him make the decision.

1363
01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:06.000
That's a rough one.

1364
01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:07.000
That's a rough one.

1365
01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
I've thought it was a rough board.

1366
01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:10.000
I've talked about this.

1367
01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
I've got a lot of t-shirts.

1368
01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:13.000
Yeah.

1369
01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:14.000
For what?

1370
01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:15.000
That's a rough one.

1371
01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:16.000
I've got a lot of t-shirts.

1372
01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:17.000
Yeah.

1373
01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:20.000
Because I have like from Gjitsu tournaments that I was in in 1996.

1374
01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:21.000
He's got to keep those.

1375
01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:31.000
I've got a lot of t-shirts.

1376
01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000
And I've got a lot of t-shirts.

1377
01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:34.000
I've got one for you.

1378
01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:37.000
She wants to throw those right in the dumpster.

1379
01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:38.000
Yeah.

1380
01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:39.000
No.

1381
01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:40.000
They're in the drawer.

1382
01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:41.000
But just to everything else.

1383
01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:46.000
Before you send me this recommendation, because I know on social media a lot of people hit me up last time.

1384
01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:49.000
Saying, hey, you can get quilts made with your old t-shirts.

1385
01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:50.000
Yeah.

1386
01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:53.000
And if it comes down to it, we've got a factory full of work.

1387
01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:54.000
So it can make you quilts.

1388
01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:55.000
Oh.

1389
01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:56.000
They would love to.

1390
01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
Oh, they would all be like, we're making Jokka.

1391
01:08:58.000 --> 01:08:59.000
We're quail.

1392
01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:00.000
Yeah.

1393
01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
I'd actually shut down the factory for a day.

1394
01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:06.000
I literally would for an exercise, just like a group exercise.

1395
01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:07.000
Send them over, dude.

1396
01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:08.000
We'll make it happen.

1397
01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:09.000
I went in on that big time.

1398
01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000
You took a couple of your t-shirts.

1399
01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:12.000
How many t-shirts do you have?

1400
01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:13.000
Planning.

1401
01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:14.000
Oh, planning.

1402
01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:15.000
Yeah.

1403
01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:16.000
Yeah.

1404
01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:17.000
I had a shirt.

1405
01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:18.000
I had a sweatshirt.

1406
01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:21.000
I wore it every day for 10 years.

1407
01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:22.000
Yeah.

1408
01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:23.000
It was yellow.

1409
01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:24.000
Oh, I know.

1410
01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:25.000
My wife called it Big Bird.

1411
01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:26.000
She threw out Big Bird.

1412
01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:27.000
Yeah.

1413
01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
I'm emotionally scarred from it.

1414
01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:30.000
Yeah.

1415
01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:31.000
I had a pair of shorts.

1416
01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:35.000
I had a pair of like crappy real thin cotton.

1417
01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:36.000
Cotton.

1418
01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:37.000
I don't think cotton.

1419
01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:38.000
Yeah.

1420
01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:39.000
Cotton.

1421
01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000
They were the most comfortable shorts ever.

1422
01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:44.000
And I'd wear them around the house on like a Saturday.

1423
01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
You know, just cruising.

1424
01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
And maybe this was the end of my cruising curve.

1425
01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
My wife just threw them away.

1426
01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:51.000
Just threw them away.

1427
01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:52.000
No reason.

1428
01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000
Just a ruthless woman.

1429
01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000
They were stinging away.

1430
01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:00.000
So that actually explains a lot because we're so on the same page.

1431
01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:03.000
It's kind of scary when it comes to making durable goods and making all the new gear.

1432
01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000
We're going to be launching next year.

1433
01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:06.000
Is that.

1434
01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:10.000
And no one somebody said to me recently is people are in life.

1435
01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:15.000
Their their attention is being pulled and it's everywhere.

1436
01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:16.000
Your mind is everywhere.

1437
01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:19.000
The last thing you want to do is be uncomfortable.

1438
01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:22.000
That's the last thing you want.

1439
01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:25.000
You can be uncomfortable in life with everything you're doing.

1440
01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:28.000
But when we're sitting here, I'm sitting here and some new grappling shorts.

1441
01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:29.000
Because they're I looked in my suitcase.

1442
01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:30.000
I dug through everything.

1443
01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
I was like, what am I going to be comfortable in?

1444
01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:35.000
Is this freaking grappling shorts and this teacher?

1445
01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:36.000
Mm-hmm.

1446
01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:37.000
I'm comfortable.

1447
01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:38.000
You know.

1448
01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:41.000
And I think that's valuable.

1449
01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:42.000
I think it's important.

1450
01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
Or else they wouldn't have been talking about it in the 1600s.

1451
01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:49.000
You don't have textiles or boots to make the apparel we need to be able to work.

1452
01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:50.000
Be comfortable and work.

1453
01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:51.000
Yeah.

1454
01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:56.000
Well, and then I actually call me an idiot.

1455
01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:01.000
But I was more interested in that piece just from the hardships.

1456
01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:04.000
And as I was reading, I was like, he's talking about.

1457
01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
About yards of cloth in the apparel.

1458
01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:10.000
I feel like a brilliant move for talking about that.

1459
01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:11.000
Yeah.

1460
01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:14.000
I'm a random.

1461
01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
Really?

1462
01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:17.000
That's pretty good.

1463
01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:18.000
Yeah.

1464
01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:19.000
Not bad.

1465
01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000
You know, as we talk about leadership a lot, always.

1466
01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:22.000
And we talk, but what's interesting.

1467
01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:23.000
I always talk about leadership.

1468
01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:30.000
And people will sometimes ask the kind of typical question of what's different between leadership and management.

1469
01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:31.000
Or do you think leaders and managers are saying,

1470
01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:32.000
thing?

1471
01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:36.000
And I always say, hey, look, you lead people and you manage money and you manage timelines and you manage process.

1472
01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:48.000
You are actively involved on a daily basis in doing both and doing both in both leading people and managing the process.

1473
01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:54.000
So you're not just growth and leadership this year, but also in process and management.

1474
01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:55.000
Yeah.

1475
01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
And I'm not the best.

1476
01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:02.000
You know, I mean, we have a great team of people that help.

1477
01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:05.000
Like, I'm all over the place.

1478
01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:09.000
When it comes to that as far as I enjoy it.

1479
01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:12.000
But at the same time, I need to be kept in check.

1480
01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:17.000
Like, you can spend too much time in one area and not in the other area.

1481
01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:23.000
But as far as the process and the team, for me, they're one and the same.

1482
01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:28.000
If you build the team, then you'll get the process together.

1483
01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:31.000
Because you're all moving the same direction.

1484
01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:32.000
It's like draft.

1485
01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:35.000
It's like drafting.

1486
01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:36.000
You know, I scroll.

1487
01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:37.000
Yeah, you know, you're going to draft.

1488
01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:38.000
It's the same thing.

1489
01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000
One person's out front and they're kind of doing this.

1490
01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:43.000
And you know what, we're not catching any wind behind them.

1491
01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:46.000
And we're just able to coast and move behind them and make our changes.

1492
01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000
Those little micro changes we need to make as we flow.

1493
01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:51.000
And when you get a whole line of cars like that, you're all just flowing.

1494
01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000
And that's what it's like in the factory.

1495
01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:54.000
So it's not me.

1496
01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:58.000
You know, I mean, I'm taking your leadership techniques and, you know,

1497
01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:02.000
these, this way of thinking is what it is.

1498
01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:03.000
It's a way of thinking.

1499
01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:06.000
And I'm just kind of filtering it down the chain.

1500
01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
And we've got good people.

1501
01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000
And together we make it happen.

1502
01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:13.000
So I may have started it, but it's not me.

1503
01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:14.000
It's everyone.

1504
01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:17.000
So for a process, the process then is decentralized.

1505
01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:20.000
You've decentralized the way that you create the process.

1506
01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:21.000
Totally.

1507
01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000
And you know, how exactly.

1508
01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000
And it's jujitsu and it's extreme ownership.

1509
01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:26.000
And it's everything.

1510
01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:29.000
It's everything. It's a beautiful thing.

1511
01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:33.000
And you're able to scale at such a rate when you just take.

1512
01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:37.000
When you detach your emotion and you decentralized command.

1513
01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:41.000
And you really believe in it and understand winning it all costs.

1514
01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:44.000
That's the trifecta.

1515
01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000
And that's what happened.

1516
01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:50.000
So we have this one employee Jen and she runs the pants line.

1517
01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:55.000
And she's been doing such a good job with the game.

1518
01:13:55.000 --> 01:14:00.000
The way that I said there had a conversation with her.

1519
01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:03.000
I'm going to take a listen.

1520
01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000
I think you got this. She's like, what?

1521
01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:08.000
I said setting up the new lines.

1522
01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000
You get the process.

1523
01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:11.000
You get.

1524
01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:15.000
You're going to develop the process because you understand what needs to take place.

1525
01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:18.000
Because you've got total buying.

1526
01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:23.000
You know, and she's not buying into.

1527
01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:30.000
She's buying into it as as I'm not a freaking explain it.

1528
01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:34.000
And it sounds kind of weird, but it's total belief.

1529
01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000
No, that's not weird.

1530
01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:39.000
You know, it's belief in the end of end in it.

1531
01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:42.000
And when you really believe in it and you're not going home and saying,

1532
01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:49.000
Pete wants me to listen to Jocco podcast or Pete wants me to read this book or Pete asked me to do this.

1533
01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:52.000
When you're going home and you're saying to your significant other,

1534
01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:57.000
hey, you know what? I was asked to do this and I did it and it worked.

1535
01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:00.000
And it's changing my life, not just that work.

1536
01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000
It's actually changing my life here.

1537
01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000
And I want to do this better in life.

1538
01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:05.000
Yeah.

1539
01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:06.000
That's powerful.

1540
01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:11.000
I look at the difference between someone that says, oh, this is what I have to do at work.

1541
01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:14.000
And this is what I am doing at work.

1542
01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:14.000
Yeah.

1543
01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:18.000
Because when they say that, that's inherent in that statement is they own it.

1544
01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:22.000
And when you get people that own it, it's theirs.

1545
01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:23.000
Yeah.

1546
01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:26.000
And they're going to make it right exactly.

1547
01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:27.000
Exactly.

1548
01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:32.000
All right. So you've accomplished a lot with this.

1549
01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:33.000
We have.

1550
01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:34.000
Yeah.

1551
01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000
Well, it started with you.

1552
01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:40.000
You have to be driven by you go just like all of us are, you know,

1553
01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:47.000
to have this vision and think and believe that you can take a 20 year old loop and get that thing up and run and make

1554
01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:48.000
close with it.

1555
01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:49.000
That's freaking crazy.

1556
01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:50.000
Yeah.

1557
01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:54.000
But you also do a great job of putting that ego in check.

1558
01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:59.000
And I'm wondering how.

1559
01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:16.000
How do you discriminate between what's positive ego and what's good and what's negative ego and what's bad and to give a little bit of context with a military with task in a bruiser, right?

1560
01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:24.000
I want everyone of those guys to believe that we are the best task unit in the history of the world.

1561
01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:25.000
That's who we are.

1562
01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:31.000
And at the same time, the dichotomy is I want them to think, oh, we need to do better.

1563
01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:32.000
We're not good enough.

1564
01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:33.000
We need to keep training.

1565
01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:34.000
We can't cut any corners.

1566
01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000
And that's basically what you have to do.

1567
01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000
I have to do as individuals.

1568
01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000
I know I'm always trying to do that.

1569
01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
What do you see from your perspective?

1570
01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000
How do you know when it's your positive ego?

1571
01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:48.000
That's going to help drive things in a positive way versus your negative ego.

1572
01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:52.000
That's going to negatively impact decisions that you're supposed to make.

1573
01:16:52.000 --> 01:17:03.000
Not based on what's the best for the company or best for the future or best for long term, but best thing for your real psycho ego that wants to just eat all these cupcakes.

1574
01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:06.000
You have full.

1575
01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:13.000
So I think I think the succeed in life you have to have a.

1576
01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:16.000
A confidence in ego a swagger.

1577
01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:19.000
And I like swagger.

1578
01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:24.000
But you also have to be a bit naive and ego makes you naive.

1579
01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000
It's really what it is.

1580
01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000
And I'll give you a good example.

1581
01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:32.000
I have this my buddy, Dustin Ireland.

1582
01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:37.000
And he's an eight-hand pilot and he's like the top eight-hand pilot in the world.

1583
01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:38.000
He taught it.

1584
01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:39.000
Red flag.

1585
01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:43.000
And he taught it to the start for the joint chiefs now and he's making his way up.

1586
01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:44.000
Who knows where to end up?

1587
01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000
Where we're kids.

1588
01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:51.000
We used to do everything together, but we were so competitive.

1589
01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:57.000
And I had an ego, he had a little bit of an ego by 7th grade.

1590
01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:00.000
We were almost dunking basketballs.

1591
01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:03.000
By 8th grade we were both dunking basketballs.

1592
01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:06.000
I'm a 6th, 3, he's 5-9.

1593
01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:10.000
That's what happened.

1594
01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:13.000
Well, you got to believe you can.

1595
01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:19.000
And the way you believe you can is by having a mindset that you can't be stopped.

1596
01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000
That's ego.

1597
01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:22.000
That's swagger.

1598
01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000
That's confidence.

1599
01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.000
But it's different.

1600
01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:29.000
It's different believing it and.

1601
01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:33.000
Putting on blinders and getting into a state of mind.

1602
01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:37.000
Putting on blinders and getting into a fog.

1603
01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:41.000
Then looking side to side as you're moving forward.

1604
01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:45.000
And making sure there's not a fog in front of you and the fog is emotion.

1605
01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:53.000
And the fog is when that wells up inside you because you need to prove something that you're going to do this.

1606
01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000
You're going to be this.

1607
01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000
I think that.

1608
01:18:57.000 --> 01:19:00.000
It's relationship based too.

1609
01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:13.000
Where if someone's coming at you negatively and you're meeting that negativity with any emotional response, you got ego.

1610
01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000
You got ego.

1611
01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:18.000
And at that point you got to self-check.

1612
01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:23.000
And I think the difference is those who are able to self-check know how to adjust there.

1613
01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:24.000
You go on the fly.

1614
01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000
You've got to know how to self-check.

1615
01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:36.000
A lot of that comes through understanding that there's a lot of people chasing you that are born every day that are going to do great things that you're here for a moment in time.

1616
01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:39.000
And that you're not special.

1617
01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.000
But believe you're special because you are.

1618
01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:44.000
You know, and there's a dichotomy in that also.

1619
01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:47.000
So I think there's a lot to it and honestly.

1620
01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:51.000
I don't think I was a man until I was in my 30s.

1621
01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:56.000
And I still think I'm working towards manhood and I truly believe that. I truly believe like extreme ownership.

1622
01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.000
I believe I'm still working towards manhood.

1623
01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:00.000
And I have a long freaking way to go.

1624
01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:05.000
So I don't know how you teach that.

1625
01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:10.000
I think you can listen to the lessons of others.

1626
01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:16.000
You know, you listen to your podcast, which is very powerful for people to listen to.

1627
01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:20.000
And I think a lot of people here, that's the reason when you talk to them.

1628
01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:26.000
And you know, in these private conversations, they, they just seems like they all have the same type of mindset.

1629
01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:29.000
You know what I mean?

1630
01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:32.000
But yeah, I mean, you go.

1631
01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:36.000
You go as a strong and powerful tool if it's utilized right and you harness that ego.

1632
01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:37.000
You can do great things.

1633
01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:43.000
But if you hang on to it like it's your only tool, you're going to fail.

1634
01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.000
You've got to be careful with that one.

1635
01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:48.000
There's a difference to between.

1636
01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:51.000
ego and pride.

1637
01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000
And they're very similar.

1638
01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:54.000
Maybe they're the same.

1639
01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.000
Maybe they're just close cousins.

1640
01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.000
Maybe they're brothers and sisters.

1641
01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000
Maybe they're twins.

1642
01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:01.000
But.

1643
01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:06.000
But because, you know, pride is one of the seven deadly sins.

1644
01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:10.000
But at the same time, of course, you want people to be proud of what they do.

1645
01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:17.000
And, you know, I know, like again with a single platoon, you want those guys to get done with a block of training and have pride that they did it better.

1646
01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000
They did it better than they were,

1647
01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000
target that they got after it.

1648
01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:22.000
That's what you want.

1649
01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:29.000
But you just have to make sure that it doesn't influence and start to cause problems elsewhere.

1650
01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:36.000
Well, ego is like, if you want to, if you want to distill it, it's like, you know, there's no eye and team.

1651
01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.000
That's ego.

1652
01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:42.000
When it's individualized, it's ego.

1653
01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:46.000
When it's a team effort and everyone's on the same page and moving towards the same purpose.

1654
01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.000
It's confidence.

1655
01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:52.000
You know, and it can be defined by, is it about you or is it about this?

1656
01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000
Is it about all of us?

1657
01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.000
Or is it just about me?

1658
01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:59.000
So that's a constant struggle.

1659
01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000
I think for a lot of entrepreneurs.

1660
01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:06.000
I think for a lot of people in leadership is, it's not about you.

1661
01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:09.000
You know, it really isn't about you.

1662
01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:13.000
It's about what you're doing and how you're doing it.

1663
01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:19.000
And that you play a role in that, but you're not, you're not the lead role.

1664
01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:22.000
You know, you're, you're, it's not a one man movie.

1665
01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:27.000
You know, it's, it's, it takes a supporting cast and that supporting cast is everybody behind the curtains.

1666
01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:28.000
That no one sees.

1667
01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:34.000
And, yeah, how's it dealing with me?

1668
01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:37.000
Really, would use great.

1669
01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:40.000
You know what's funny is,

1670
01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:48.000
we both have a certain level of ego, but we both don't.

1671
01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:56.000
Because if you, if you check me, like, hey, and you can ask a simple question and flank me real quick.

1672
01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.000
And be like, I've got to, and let me shift my thinking real quick.

1673
01:22:58.000 --> 01:22:59.000
Give me a second or whatever.

1674
01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000
We're having a conversation yesterday.

1675
01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.000
And I was like, well, think about this.

1676
01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:04.000
Well, what do you think about this?

1677
01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.000
And I'm not going to share what that was.

1678
01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.000
And, you know, you pause.

1679
01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:11.000
And you don't react to your respond.

1680
01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:12.000
I like that.

1681
01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:20.000
Because I know you're coming to me with a real answer that is you're emotionally detached from.

1682
01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:22.000
And you thought about before you responded.

1683
01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:25.000
And if it was an ego driven, you just wouldn't like do that.

1684
01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000
Just provide you to this.

1685
01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.000
You know, what you stop, and you take about it.

1686
01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:34.000
And that's real good.

1687
01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:37.000
The other thing that's great about working with you is

1688
01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:40.000
that you're really good.

1689
01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000
And you're, you're real unique, right?

1690
01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:45.000
Because you're this, you're this.

1691
01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000
You have a lot of influence, first of all.

1692
01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:52.000
Over a lot of diverse, it's a diverse group of people.

1693
01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:57.000
I've seen, I mean, just at this camp, if you look at the people that you've touched that are here.

1694
01:23:57.000 --> 01:24:03.000
Men, women, younger, older, from all different,

1695
01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:08.000
let's say, backgrounds, racial backgrounds, cultural backgrounds.

1696
01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000
Like there's tons of different types of people.

1697
01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000
And that's a sampling.

1698
01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:15.000
That's just a sampling of the people you touch.

1699
01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:19.000
You know, and for me to check my ego and look at you and say, well, how can

1700
01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:22.000
Jocco touch these people the way he does?

1701
01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:26.000
Then I need to dig deeper and find out why.

1702
01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:32.000
You know, and it takes a human, someone who who understands

1703
01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:37.000
humility to do that.

1704
01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:40.000
Because your background is very unique.

1705
01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:41.000
There's not everyone.

1706
01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:42.000
That's a Navy seal.

1707
01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:45.000
There's not everyone's a Jiu-Sup Black Belt.

1708
01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:52.000
There's not everyone that runs a leadership company that's sought out by some of the big companies in the world.

1709
01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:57.000
So I check my ego to be like, man, he's maybe sound real cool.

1710
01:24:57.000 --> 01:25:00.000
I check my ego to be like, man, Jocco actually's going to help me.

1711
01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:07.000
So when I call you, I'm not like, I'm like, yeah, I'm just going to call Jocco and figure this out.

1712
01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:10.000
I'm like, okay, Jocco's on the west coast.

1713
01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:11.000
I check my ego.

1714
01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:12.000
I check everything he's okay.

1715
01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.000
Jocco's on the west coast.

1716
01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:17.000
I know he's probably traveling, you know, Monday and Wednesday.

1717
01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:18.000
He's going to be in the airport.

1718
01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.000
He's going to be getting hit up.

1719
01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:24.000
I'm going to reach out to him at this time and see if he's got five minutes for a phone call

1720
01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:27.000
because I know how much your time is worth.

1721
01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:33.000
So which is interesting because you know what I think about working with you, right?

1722
01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.000
Which is, which is awesome.

1723
01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:38.000
And I think the quickest way to explain it.

1724
01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:43.000
And I'm the only reason I'm talking about this is because I think there's lessons to be learned from it.

1725
01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:46.000
You and I make big decisions.

1726
01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:47.000
Big decisions.

1727
01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:48.000
Quickly.

1728
01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:49.000
Quickly.

1729
01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:53.000
With and the key factor in making big decisions quickly between you and me,

1730
01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:59.000
decisions that have a lot of money on blind decisions that have people's, you know, livelihoods on the lines.

1731
01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000
We're making decisions like that.

1732
01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:04.000
And there's like no ego.

1733
01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:07.000
So in other words, I think you might hit me up.

1734
01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:10.000
Hey, I think we should do this.

1735
01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.000
And maybe I have a different idea.

1736
01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:15.000
And I just completely remove the fact that it's my idea or your idea.

1737
01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:18.000
It's like who, which one of these two ideas is better?

1738
01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:19.000
It's better.

1739
01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000
I don't care who where it came from.

1740
01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:25.000
And and you and I, I know we got some similar parts of our personality.

1741
01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:28.000
Obviously, we got some pretty divergent parts too.

1742
01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:32.000
That's across the over and and so it's it's good to be able to just say,

1743
01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:42.000
Okay, I don't care whose idea this is, which one of these two divergent ideas is going to be the better one for what we're trying to do,

1744
01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:46.000
which one is going to deliver more satisfaction to the people we're trying to serve,

1745
01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:49.000
you know, which is what we're always thinking about.

1746
01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:53.000
How is this going to help the people that we're trying, the people that are trying that we're trying to serve?

1747
01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.000
How we can help with how can we help more?

1748
01:26:55.000 --> 01:27:04.000
And you know what's funny is when you know you, your ego is playing a role in your decision making is when you have to say something like this.

1749
01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:08.000
I'm emotionally detached.

1750
01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:13.000
Number one, if you have to say it, you are number two.

1751
01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.000
Number two, I'm completely detached right now.

1752
01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:22.000
Number two, you have to qualify your next statement by and I've done this a few times and I feel like such a douchebag.

1753
01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:25.000
You have to qualify your statement by this.

1754
01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000
I've done this for 20 years.

1755
01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.000
I've expert in it.

1756
01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.000
Yeah.

1757
01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.000
He's expert expert marketer marketer.

1758
01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:37.000
So then then I get out phones like one, I do you should bad.

1759
01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:42.000
But you've got to understand that that when you have to say those things, we have to qualify those things.

1760
01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:51.000
It's like saying, Jocca says, you know, when you have to qualify your next statement, you've got to go and I do it, you know,

1761
01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:56.000
daily, even well, and in addition to not having an addition to it being your ego that's going up,

1762
01:27:56.000 --> 01:28:01.000
you also don't have a legitimate reason because if it was a legitimate reason, you could articulate it properly.

1763
01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:02.000
Right.

1764
01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:09.000
If I'm trying to say something to you and I say, look bro, these are this, I look, I have a good podcast.

1765
01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:12.000
A lot more people listen to my podcast, you know, podcast, you should listen to me.

1766
01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:16.000
That means I couldn't actually articulate what I was trying to say properly.

1767
01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:20.000
If I could articulate what I was trying to say, you'd go, oh, well, that makes sense.

1768
01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:21.000
Exactly.

1769
01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:24.000
If I can't, then I go, my podcast got more listeners.

1770
01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:26.000
You're so listening to me.

1771
01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:27.000
Yeah.

1772
01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:31.000
Like you said, that would be just men, level 12, douche.

1773
01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.000
But you know, and it's been the same thing.

1774
01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:37.000
Sometimes you've said to me, you said something that you would like to be like, I don't even know why I said that.

1775
01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:40.000
And it was just start laughing about it.

1776
01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:44.000
I'm like, whatever, do what we're doing.

1777
01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:54.000
I was going to say something to that point though, as far as the ego is concerned.

1778
01:28:54.000 --> 01:29:02.000
I think that if you don't have that sense, that feeling, like, it can be done.

1779
01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:03.000
You can do it.

1780
01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:04.000
You will do it.

1781
01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:11.000
But if you don't have that, I don't think you have the best tool you need.

1782
01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:15.000
I said something at one of the masters.

1783
01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:20.000
I said, and it's a dichotomy.

1784
01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:27.000
Believe won't get you anything, but without belief, you won't get anything.

1785
01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:28.000
Exactly.

1786
01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:33.000
So belief by itself, like, you know those people that are, they write a meme.

1787
01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.000
I just had to throw that neck of a voice.

1788
01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:36.000
I always thought that was meme-me.

1789
01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.000
I never knew it was meme-me.

1790
01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:39.000
Is it?

1791
01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:40.000
Well, is it?

1792
01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:41.000
Okay.

1793
01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.000
I was made really close right there.

1794
01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:47.000
The memes that say, you know, if you believe it, you can achieve it.

1795
01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:48.000
Yeah.

1796
01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:50.000
And that's not true.

1797
01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:53.000
Because just believing it does not make you achieve it.

1798
01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:58.000
If you say, I believe I'm going to be able to do 30 pull ups in two weeks.

1799
01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:00.000
And right now I can do seven.

1800
01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:03.000
Believe isn't going to get you there.

1801
01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:04.000
Exactly.

1802
01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:06.000
You have to make it happen.

1803
01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:07.000
That's what you're doing.

1804
01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:12.000
But if you truly don't believe that you can get there, you're not going to make the

1805
01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:14.000
effort to get it done.

1806
01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:15.000
Exactly.

1807
01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:16.000
Because guess what?

1808
01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:20.000
There's going to be times in any pursuit that you make.

1809
01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.000
There's going to be times where you're going to be put in check.

1810
01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:23.000
You're going to be tested.

1811
01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:26.000
You're going to be, you're going to be trials and tribulations.

1812
01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:31.000
And if you don't believe that you can get there, you're going to stop.

1813
01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:34.000
You're going to quit and you're not going to make it.

1814
01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:39.000
So, belief by itself won't get you anywhere.

1815
01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:42.000
But without belief, you're not going anywhere.

1816
01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:45.000
You know what I like to say is that you have this.

1817
01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:47.000
You, there's a dream.

1818
01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:51.000
And a dream is something in a state of sleep.

1819
01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:53.000
Then there's a belief.

1820
01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:56.000
And then there's the thing you're trying to achieve.

1821
01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:57.000
And then there's a void.

1822
01:30:57.000 --> 01:31:01.000
And in that void, you have to fill it with action.

1823
01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.000
You know, stepping forward.

1824
01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:07.000
So dreaming is one thing everybody has dreams.

1825
01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.000
Believing you take it a step further.

1826
01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:12.000
And then filling the void with action makes things happen.

1827
01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:15.000
So, um, we're on the same page.

1828
01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:16.000
I mean, a thousand percent.

1829
01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:18.000
Once again, once again.

1830
01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:22.000
Um, you know, that's, that's awesome.

1831
01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:25.000
I'm glad that, you know, it's awesome to be working.

1832
01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:27.000
And that, the things that we're doing.

1833
01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:28.000
People are digging.

1834
01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:29.000
So that's cool.

1835
01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.000
But I wanted to like actually talk a little bit.

1836
01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000
This is what at GG2 camp right now.

1837
01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:34.000
Can I give them an example, though, of what?

1838
01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:36.000
I want to, I want to just give me an example of like,

1839
01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:39.000
when you, because we're, now because we're doing what we,

1840
01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:42.000
what we would do is like, we work so well together.

1841
01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:43.000
Right?

1842
01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:45.000
We're doing the same damn thing.

1843
01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:48.000
You know, like, we're, like, we work so well that we do work well together.

1844
01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:52.000
But let's give an example of how something could have gone wrong.

1845
01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:55.000
Or let's say we got off track for a minute and came back.

1846
01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:56.000
Right?

1847
01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:57.000
Here we go.

1848
01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:58.000
I designed this packaging.

1849
01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:01.000
And I was like, this is the best packaging.

1850
01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:02.000
This is the nicest packaging.

1851
01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:03.000
What was before?

1852
01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:04.000
It was for a new product.

1853
01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:05.000
We shall not talk about.

1854
01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:06.000
Okay.

1855
01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:07.000
Okay.

1856
01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:08.000
Yeah.

1857
01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:10.000
And so it was, it was colorful.

1858
01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:12.000
It was, it's going to, you know, it's, it's, it's perfect.

1859
01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:14.000
It was great.

1860
01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:15.000
Yeah.

1861
01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:16.000
I think it was funny.

1862
01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.000
Yeah.

1863
01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:19.000
I did try to thank you.

1864
01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:20.000
And you tried to flank me.

1865
01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:21.000
I did.

1866
01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:24.000
I did try to thank you.

1867
01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:27.000
And so I showed it to be little and Megan.

1868
01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:30.000
And, you know, like, that's awesome.

1869
01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:34.000
I was like, yeah, I was like, I went a little over the top with it.

1870
01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:37.000
But it, like, this packaging would be the best.

1871
01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:38.000
Right?

1872
01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:39.000
That's what I told them.

1873
01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:40.000
I built myself up.

1874
01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:41.000
I built them up.

1875
01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:45.000
This packaging would be the best because of my expertise.

1876
01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:46.000
Right?

1877
01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:51.000
And, uh, and Brian's like, what's jacquo going to think about it?

1878
01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.000
And I was like, doesn't matter.

1879
01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:54.000
Doesn't matter.

1880
01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:55.000
Yeah.

1881
01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:56.000
Exactly.

1882
01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:57.000
Doesn't matter.

1883
01:32:57.000 --> 01:33:00.000
So here I have, did you say, did you say, like, you know what, we'll, we'll explain it to him.

1884
01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:01.000
We'll get him.

1885
01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:02.000
Yeah.

1886
01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:05.000
I said he's going to bring it down a level from what it is.

1887
01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:09.000
But hopefully we'll hit somewhere in between.

1888
01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:13.000
And so Brian, and then Brian's like, bro, if he doesn't, Mike,

1889
01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:16.000
that's just ridiculous.

1890
01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:18.000
And I'm like, no, I should do that.

1891
01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:20.000
I don't even worry about it.

1892
01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:21.000
I should, I don't even worry about it.

1893
01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:22.000
I should, I don't even worry about it.

1894
01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:23.000
I should, I don't even worry about it.

1895
01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:24.000
I should, I don't even worry about it.

1896
01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:29.000
So I said it to you and it was like, no response.

1897
01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:33.000
And then you have like, you know, you iced me.

1898
01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:39.000
And in part of part of this, and when I'm talking about drafting, right?

1899
01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:44.000
Like, okay, my ego comes into play and then Jaco Zigo comes into play.

1900
01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:47.000
And then he says something, then I'd back off.

1901
01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.000
And then it comes back and his goes back.

1902
01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:50.000
And it back up.

1903
01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:52.000
So there's just constant, but that's not ego.

1904
01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:53.000
It's not ego.

1905
01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:56.000
It's coming to a decision that's best.

1906
01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:59.000
So like, after this call, it's called a rainbow, right?

1907
01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:02.000
Then all of a sudden you like make the rainbow black.

1908
01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:03.000
The whole rainbow.

1909
01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:04.000
The whole rainbow.

1910
01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:05.000
Just make a black.

1911
01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:06.000
The whole rainbow.

1912
01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:08.000
And that would be kind of cool.

1913
01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:13.000
So I go out to Brian now and I was like, yeah, Jaco doesn't like it.

1914
01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:19.000
And he like stands up and he's like, bro, he's like, if he doesn't like,

1915
01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:23.000
just like, I don't know, I know, he lives like a man or he can't.

1916
01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:24.000
He's not cool.

1917
01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:26.000
He's trying to be sensible.

1918
01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:28.000
Yeah, yeah, of course he is.

1919
01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:33.000
So like, I literally, and then I like, then, then I literally,

1920
01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:36.000
I was like, he's got on brand.

1921
01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:39.000
It's not right. And so I made a quick check, right?

1922
01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:43.000
And I was like, dude, I said, you know, I said, I think the packaging

1923
01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:46.000
were great, but you know what?

1924
01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:50.000
Let me go back to the drawing board because I haven't seen

1925
01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:51.000
what else it could look like.

1926
01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:54.000
How do you freaking know what else it could look like?

1927
01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:57.000
So then I went back to the drawing board and, you know,

1928
01:34:57.000 --> 01:35:01.000
when we pushed a further, we went on brand more with it.

1929
01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:06.000
And then you're like, yeah, not bad. Still not good, whatever.

1930
01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:08.000
You didn't really say this really like.

1931
01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:11.000
First four responses were you for too much.

1932
01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:12.000
Yeah, too much.

1933
01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:13.000
Too much.

1934
01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:14.000
Next one too much.

1935
01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:15.000
Yeah.

1936
01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:15.000
Exactly.

1937
01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:18.000
So you're like, okay, he just wants me to bring this back to the basics.

1938
01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:20.000
So you know what's funny?

1939
01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:23.000
You use the term on brand.

1940
01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:28.000
And that's one of those things I hear get thrown around like about

1941
01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:31.000
brands, right?

1942
01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:34.000
And I was at, I was getting interviewed the other day.

1943
01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:35.000
I was just not something to view.

1944
01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:39.000
And the guy said something about like, you know, it's

1945
01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:42.000
That's impressive how quickly you've built your brand.

1946
01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:43.000
Right.

1947
01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:47.000
And I looked at him and I said, I'm not a brand.

1948
01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.000
I'm a person.

1949
01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:50.000
I'm a person.

1950
01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:57.000
What I'm doing is not what I'm doing so that I can leverage.

1951
01:35:57.000 --> 01:36:01.000
People.

1952
01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:05.000
What I do is just me and I'm just a person.

1953
01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:11.000
So if you asked me if I would wear a rainbow t-shirt, I wouldn't.

1954
01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:14.000
No, I've asked you to wear lots of stuff when you have it.

1955
01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:21.000
And if you asked me, but that's not because of I'm trying to be something.

1956
01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.000
It's because that's who I am.

1957
01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:29.000
Right. And I have been, I had one of my brothers who I hadn't seen in a while.

1958
01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:35.000
And he, we met at a little place we'd go to in San Diego.

1959
01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:38.000
And I hadn't seen him in a year and a half.

1960
01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:43.000
And he comes walking in and he sees me and I'm wearing the same thing that I always

1961
01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:44.000
wear.

1962
01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:47.000
Paragines, a victory black t-shirt.

1963
01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:50.000
And he walks in and he sees, and I was wintertime and I was wearing a flannel.

1964
01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:53.000
Like a whatever, like a wick and a new wringling flannel.

1965
01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:58.000
Like a new England, but like cheap whatever flannel with the quilt inside of it.

1966
01:36:58.000 --> 01:36:59.000
Yeah.

1967
01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:05.000
And he sees me and like when he sees me, and this is kind of, you know, after the books in the podcast,

1968
01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:09.000
and he's another seal. So he suspect.

1969
01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:16.000
And he sees me and I see his face and his face like gets happy when he sees me.

1970
01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:20.000
And he comes over and like does like a bro hug.

1971
01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:23.000
And he says, probably you're fucking exactly the same.

1972
01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.000
And I was like, yeah, man.

1973
01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:29.000
And he goes, I fucking knew it.

1974
01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:33.000
And like that to me was the best compliment I'll ever get.

1975
01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:38.000
Is like, okay, no matter what happens, I'm not a brand.

1976
01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:45.000
I'm not doing anything for, you know, any other reason other than it's just me.

1977
01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:46.000
And that's just just what I'm doing.

1978
01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:48.000
And if people are cool with it, man, that's awesome.

1979
01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:49.000
I'm stoked.

1980
01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:55.000
And that's what I love about you because you actually are checking your ego because this is who you are,

1981
01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:57.000
and you're not this person.

1982
01:37:57.000 --> 01:38:02.000
And that's what, that's why you work, you know, that's why it works.

1983
01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:03.000
No rainbows.

1984
01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:04.000
No rainbows, man.

1985
01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:07.000
No rainbow emojis coming from me.

1986
01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:08.000
I don't mind rainbows.

1987
01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:12.000
But echo said, oh, he texted my wife sometimes because they got to organize

1988
01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:16.000
and administrators of, he sent her a unicorn and a rainbow.

1989
01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:17.000
Yeah.

1990
01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:19.000
Should I be pissed at that?

1991
01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:22.000
Should another man send another, should send another placement?

1992
01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:25.000
Was it unicorn then rainbow or rainbow then unicorn?

1993
01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:28.000
I don't know what kind of secret messages are going on over there.

1994
01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:30.000
Was that even moon, bro?

1995
01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:32.000
It's just a soft, very common.

1996
01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:39.000
Would you send another man's wife, a rainbow and a unicorn in a tax, definitely not?

1997
01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:41.000
No, no, no, no, but yes, that's why.

1998
01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:43.000
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1999
01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:44.000
You asked a question wrong.

2000
01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:49.000
You, the question is, are there any possible circumstances,

2001
01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:52.000
where it's okay to send a rainbow and a unicorn?

2002
01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:54.000
Well, let me give you an example, echo.

2003
01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:57.000
If you're at, if you like a miscommunication,

2004
01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:58.000
if you're at the load in the air

2005
01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:01.000
and you get the prize, unicorn,

2006
01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:03.000
the fluffy one, do you turn it hand it to your wife

2007
01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:05.000
or do you turn it hand it to Chocco's wife?

2008
01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:06.000
But.

2009
01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:07.000
Okay, so get it.

2010
01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:10.000
I just gave you a little bucket of juice.

2011
01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:10.84
You're my phone.

2012
01:39:10.84 --> 01:39:13.000
On my hand, I'm supposed to go into my dinner.

2013
01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:14.76
Otherwise, any other girls that are

2014
01:39:14.76 --> 01:39:15.96
going to let unicorns all around.

2015
01:39:15.96 --> 01:39:16.76
All around the channel.

2016
01:39:16.76 --> 01:39:17.72
I go hasn't changed.

2017
01:39:17.72 --> 01:39:18.80
And that guy has a train for it,

2018
01:39:18.80 --> 01:39:20.08
but he's coming after my negative.

2019
01:39:20.08 --> 01:39:21.84
I'm back in the front of my girlfriend.

2020
01:39:21.84 --> 01:39:24.76
I'm gripping it, ready to be.

2021
01:39:24.76 --> 01:39:25.36
Yeah, no.

2022
01:39:25.36 --> 01:39:25.96
I was just kidding.

2023
01:39:25.96 --> 01:39:28.08
No, I think it's absolutely okay.

2024
01:39:28.08 --> 01:39:29.64
Because we don't have ego.

2025
01:39:29.64 --> 01:39:30.44
I'm just making sure.

2026
01:39:30.44 --> 01:39:31.76
So we know we're dropping ego.

2027
01:39:31.76 --> 01:39:32.92
Hey, with your own friends.

2028
01:39:32.92 --> 01:39:34.000
Yeah, no, that's cool.

2029
01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:35.32
I guess.

2030
01:39:35.32 --> 01:39:37.76
I don't send his wife unicorns and rain.

2031
01:39:37.76 --> 01:39:38.12
Right.

2032
01:39:38.12 --> 01:39:39.28
But if you did, that's cool.

2033
01:39:39.28 --> 01:39:40.28
In fact, it's a name.

2034
01:39:40.28 --> 01:39:41.28
That's kind of nice.

2035
01:39:41.28 --> 01:39:42.28
Talk to.

2036
01:39:42.28 --> 01:39:43.28
Yeah.

2037
01:39:43.28 --> 01:39:44.28
You know what?

2038
01:39:44.28 --> 01:39:46.28
You want to know what?

2039
01:39:46.28 --> 01:39:49.68
You want to know the only reason why I think it's acceptable.

2040
01:39:49.68 --> 01:39:54.28
That this guy echoed Charles Sands, my wife.

2041
01:39:54.28 --> 01:39:55.28
Unicorns and rainbows.

2042
01:39:55.28 --> 01:39:56.56
Because you love him like a brother.

2043
01:39:56.56 --> 01:40:00.04
No, because he sends me unicorns and rainbows too.

2044
01:40:00.04 --> 01:40:01.04
There you go.

2045
01:40:01.04 --> 01:40:02.04
He keeps running all around.

2046
01:40:02.04 --> 01:40:03.04
Yeah, he keeps.

2047
01:40:03.04 --> 01:40:04.04
He actually sends me.

2048
01:40:04.04 --> 01:40:06.80
I think actually sending me my wife unicorns and rainbows.

2049
01:40:06.80 --> 01:40:07.80
He probably does.

2050
01:40:07.80 --> 01:40:08.80
You know what?

2051
01:40:08.80 --> 01:40:10.80
He has the best flanking technique.

2052
01:40:10.80 --> 01:40:11.80
What is that?

2053
01:40:11.80 --> 01:40:13.56
What do you do?

2054
01:40:13.56 --> 01:40:15.80
He makes sure the wives are happy.

2055
01:40:15.80 --> 01:40:16.80
Oh, yeah.

2056
01:40:16.80 --> 01:40:17.80
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2057
01:40:17.80 --> 01:40:18.80
Yeah, man.

2058
01:40:18.80 --> 01:40:19.80
Yeah, yeah.

2059
01:40:19.80 --> 01:40:21.80
He has your wife and woman like, I go so nice.

2060
01:40:21.80 --> 01:40:22.80
Oh, yeah.

2061
01:40:22.80 --> 01:40:23.80
Absolutely.

2062
01:40:23.80 --> 01:40:24.80
That's like three unicorns and rainbows.

2063
01:40:24.80 --> 01:40:26.80
All of a sudden he's nice.

2064
01:40:26.80 --> 01:40:28.80
Well, that's why I send him because it's nice.

2065
01:40:28.80 --> 01:40:29.80
So boom, there you go.

2066
01:40:29.80 --> 01:40:30.80
Where is the win win win?

2067
01:40:30.80 --> 01:40:32.80
Yeah, oh, man.

2068
01:40:32.80 --> 01:40:36.40
So I didn't want to before you brought it back to you.

2069
01:40:36.40 --> 01:40:37.40
It's just cool man.

2070
01:40:37.40 --> 01:40:38.40
That's good points, man.

2071
01:40:38.40 --> 01:40:43.20
I mean, I think you, you and I are both like regardless of anything else.

2072
01:40:43.20 --> 01:40:47.04
We're both established human beings, man with families and businesses.

2073
01:40:47.04 --> 01:40:51.40
So there's definitely going to be, I mean, I remember when I met you, I was like, you

2074
01:40:51.40 --> 01:40:53.32
know, this may not work out.

2075
01:40:53.32 --> 01:40:54.92
This may not work out.

2076
01:40:54.92 --> 01:40:58.56
And I was like, you know, this guy, he's done a lot.

2077
01:40:58.56 --> 01:41:00.72
And his ego might be a little bit.

2078
01:41:00.72 --> 01:41:04.92
There might not be enough room for someone else in this picture.

2079
01:41:04.92 --> 01:41:08.28
What I realized is it what it wasn't ego you know what it was.

2080
01:41:08.28 --> 01:41:09.28
It was what I talked about it.

2081
01:41:09.28 --> 01:41:10.72
It was pride.

2082
01:41:10.72 --> 01:41:13.88
You were proud of what you and your team had done.

2083
01:41:13.88 --> 01:41:15.96
Proud of that rightfully so.

2084
01:41:15.96 --> 01:41:17.92
I'd say pride and protection.

2085
01:41:17.92 --> 01:41:18.92
Yeah, yeah.

2086
01:41:18.92 --> 01:41:19.92
Yeah, for sure.

2087
01:41:19.92 --> 01:41:20.92
For sure.

2088
01:41:20.92 --> 01:41:21.92
Like, life's work.

2089
01:41:21.92 --> 01:41:23.92
You know, we just did the kippling poem.

2090
01:41:23.92 --> 01:41:28.92
If everything you put your whole life into, that's what that's what this is.

2091
01:41:28.92 --> 01:41:30.92
And you're like, look at me like a hey man.

2092
01:41:30.92 --> 01:41:33.92
All of a sudden, I can't just let's do a little security check.

2093
01:41:33.92 --> 01:41:34.76
Exactly.

2094
01:41:34.76 --> 01:41:38.08
But you know, I just realized how proud you were of that.

2095
01:41:38.08 --> 01:41:44.60
And that your ego, your ego was, hey, I don't care about that.

2096
01:41:44.60 --> 01:41:48.52
What I care about is making sure that this goes in the right direction.

2097
01:41:48.52 --> 01:41:52.80
There's like, like, what's kind of like what I just said about what is me?

2098
01:41:52.80 --> 01:41:54.44
Well, this is you, right?

2099
01:41:54.44 --> 01:41:59.76
This is like what you built and you want to make sure that it's reflected well.

2100
01:41:59.76 --> 01:42:00.76
Yeah, that's all the time.

2101
01:42:00.76 --> 01:42:01.76
That's it.

2102
01:42:01.76 --> 01:42:03.88
And there's not nothing wrong with that.

2103
01:42:03.88 --> 01:42:07.12
If you didn't have that, you wouldn't be here.

2104
01:42:07.12 --> 01:42:09.76
You wouldn't have made it this far.

2105
01:42:09.76 --> 01:42:10.76
No chance.

2106
01:42:10.76 --> 01:42:11.76
True.

2107
01:42:11.76 --> 01:42:16.88
You've given up after the freaking first tangled bunch of, right?

2108
01:42:16.88 --> 01:42:18.88
It's getting out of the world.

2109
01:42:18.88 --> 01:42:19.88
Yeah.

2110
01:42:19.88 --> 01:42:20.88
All right.

2111
01:42:20.88 --> 01:42:21.88
DJ, too.

2112
01:42:21.88 --> 01:42:22.88
Yeah, man.

2113
01:42:22.88 --> 01:42:24.88
I want to talk because it's a pretty, do you just can't be awesome?

2114
01:42:24.88 --> 01:42:25.88
Clearly.

2115
01:42:25.88 --> 01:42:26.88
Do you do immersion kippling?

2116
01:42:26.88 --> 01:42:29.88
If you don't want to talk about it's, was it seven days total?

2117
01:42:29.88 --> 01:42:35.52
Yeah, Sunday to Sunday. Sunday to seven Sunday up in Maine and the week before Labor Day.

2118
01:42:35.52 --> 01:42:36.92
We before Labor Day, DJ, too.

2119
01:42:36.92 --> 01:42:37.92
DJ, too.

2120
01:42:37.92 --> 01:42:38.92
And DJ, too.

2121
01:42:38.92 --> 01:42:39.92
Three times a day.

2122
01:42:39.92 --> 01:42:40.92
We have sessions.

2123
01:42:40.92 --> 01:42:42.12
People are training outside of sessions.

2124
01:42:42.12 --> 01:42:44.48
But you've been running it for seven years.

2125
01:42:44.48 --> 01:42:45.96
Beautiful camp here.

2126
01:42:45.96 --> 01:42:46.96
Camp Laurel.

2127
01:42:46.96 --> 01:42:47.96
Yeah.

2128
01:42:47.96 --> 01:42:48.96
And what's the town?

2129
01:42:48.96 --> 01:42:52.60
It's where actually in Mount Vernon, Maine, Mount Vernon, Maine, on echo.

2130
01:42:52.60 --> 01:42:53.60
Echo Lake.

2131
01:42:53.60 --> 01:42:54.60
Echo Charles.

2132
01:42:54.60 --> 01:42:55.60
Echo Charles Lake.

2133
01:42:55.60 --> 01:42:56.60
Layers.

2134
01:42:56.60 --> 01:42:57.60
Did you jump in this week?

2135
01:42:57.60 --> 01:42:58.60
Thank you.

2136
01:42:58.60 --> 01:42:59.60
Thank you.

2137
01:42:59.60 --> 01:43:02.60
I have found the time and brought you candy and a roll.

2138
01:43:02.60 --> 01:43:03.60
You can't throw it into your outer door.

2139
01:43:03.60 --> 01:43:04.60
That's right.

2140
01:43:04.60 --> 01:43:05.60
Really?

2141
01:43:05.60 --> 01:43:06.60
I'm not feeling real.

2142
01:43:06.60 --> 01:43:08.60
But you saw the night tea and I knew.

2143
01:43:08.60 --> 01:43:11.60
I know when you look up that direction.

2144
01:43:11.60 --> 01:43:14.60
You go to the creative party or brain instead of the analytical.

2145
01:43:14.60 --> 01:43:16.60
You see that he's like, can't find this time.

2146
01:43:16.60 --> 01:43:19.60
No matter how good it going with the better words of time.

2147
01:43:19.60 --> 01:43:23.60
It's like on my way, like when I think about it, I'm like doing something and then, you know,

2148
01:43:23.60 --> 01:43:24.60
wanting you're, I'm done doing it.

2149
01:43:24.60 --> 01:43:27.60
I just, you know, it's not in my mind for yet.

2150
01:43:27.60 --> 01:43:30.60
I have not, I have not, I have not probably worked on jumping in the lake.

2151
01:43:30.60 --> 01:43:31.60
Yeah, yeah.

2152
01:43:31.60 --> 01:43:32.60
I've tried this.

2153
01:43:32.60 --> 01:43:34.60
It was so hot when we got here.

2154
01:43:34.60 --> 01:43:38.60
It was actually, I was working out in the morning in the gym and it was, I was sweating.

2155
01:43:38.60 --> 01:43:39.60
So, because I sweat a lot.

2156
01:43:39.60 --> 01:43:40.60
Yeah.

2157
01:43:40.60 --> 01:43:45.60
And I mean, clearly, if you go on my social media, I take some pictures of my sweat sometimes.

2158
01:43:45.60 --> 01:43:47.60
But I was sweating so much.

2159
01:43:47.60 --> 01:43:51.60
It was freaking gross because it was 95 degrees in humid.

2160
01:43:51.60 --> 01:43:54.60
And so there's just Lake Jocco in the gym.

2161
01:43:54.60 --> 01:43:57.60
I get to relax everywhere. I think people were, people were like, oh, fired up.

2162
01:43:57.60 --> 01:43:59.60
Jocco's here. Oh, that's kind of gross.

2163
01:43:59.60 --> 01:44:00.60
No, yeah.

2164
01:44:00.60 --> 01:44:01.60
For a second.

2165
01:44:01.60 --> 01:44:04.60
But then you jump from the lake and then a bunch of people showed up and you were walking down the

2166
01:44:04.60 --> 01:44:07.60
dock and everyone is like, oh, shit.

2167
01:44:07.60 --> 01:44:09.60
Like, king Arthur walking into this house.

2168
01:44:09.60 --> 01:44:11.60
You were just like, you were just like walking.

2169
01:44:11.60 --> 01:44:14.60
And I was like, and I was, I was standing up on my dock when I can't have it.

2170
01:44:14.60 --> 01:44:16.60
And everyone's just like, oh, I'm so shocked.

2171
01:44:16.60 --> 01:44:19.60
Yeah, I remember, remember, remember,

2172
01:44:19.60 --> 01:44:23.60
I remember, remember, Daisy at the factory when when there was the bottle of out there.

2173
01:44:23.60 --> 01:44:29.60
And she came over to me and she said, hey, can I have some bottle of out and you were right next door and she had met you yet.

2174
01:44:29.60 --> 01:44:31.60
She was like, 19 years old.

2175
01:44:31.60 --> 01:44:32.60
And she listens to the podcast.

2176
01:44:32.60 --> 01:44:37.60
And I was like, yeah, you got to ask Jocco wherever she's like, oh, I just want that.

2177
01:44:37.60 --> 01:44:41.60
And I was like, yeah, he's right there and she looks behind her and she looks up and she's like,

2178
01:44:41.60 --> 01:44:43.60
Oh, we're Jocco.

2179
01:44:43.60 --> 01:44:44.60
I was like, what?

2180
01:44:44.60 --> 01:44:50.60
So funny. Anyways, we had like 200 people doing that. So you were just like, and then you got a bomb bar.

2181
01:44:50.60 --> 01:44:52.60
It was awesome.

2182
01:44:52.60 --> 01:44:56.60
Well, I have been hitting the lake after I get out of Lake Jocco in the gym.

2183
01:44:56.60 --> 01:44:56.60
Yeah.

2184
01:44:56.60 --> 01:44:59.60
Then I moved down to Lake Echo and go for a swim.

2185
01:44:59.60 --> 01:45:02.60
And it is awesome. It's been warm too.

2186
01:45:02.60 --> 01:45:02.60
Yeah.

2187
01:45:02.60 --> 01:45:03.60
It's been warm.

2188
01:45:03.60 --> 01:45:05.60
People weren't prepped for the shift.

2189
01:45:05.60 --> 01:45:06.60
Oh, no.

2190
01:45:06.60 --> 01:45:07.60
I warned them. I know.

2191
01:45:07.60 --> 01:45:11.60
I actually posted like videos in my car of the temperature.

2192
01:45:11.60 --> 01:45:15.60
Okay. Here's the temperature. It's 55 degrees. Look, see here.

2193
01:45:15.60 --> 01:45:18.60
It's going to get colder and the daytime's going to be 80 or 90.

2194
01:45:18.60 --> 01:45:20.60
Prepaire for that.

2195
01:45:20.60 --> 01:45:23.60
How people are getting so soon.

2196
01:45:23.60 --> 01:45:28.60
So we're here for Jocco. Not just for swimming and working out, even though that is part of it.

2197
01:45:28.60 --> 01:45:34.60
I was wondering about so it's good to when you do something. You've done this once every year.

2198
01:45:34.60 --> 01:45:36.60
You do it done it for seven years.

2199
01:45:36.60 --> 01:45:40.60
When you have a frame like that, it's like a snapshot in time.

2200
01:45:40.60 --> 01:45:44.60
I wanted to kind of ask you about what you've seen.

2201
01:45:44.60 --> 01:45:50.60
First of all, Jiu Jitsu in terms of the people that are coming to camp.

2202
01:45:50.60 --> 01:45:53.60
Who are they? What's been different?

2203
01:45:53.60 --> 01:45:58.60
I mean, obviously there's a big change this year because we had a lot of people that listen to this podcast.

2204
01:45:58.60 --> 01:45:59.60
Yeah.

2205
01:45:59.60 --> 01:46:00.60
That have come up.

2206
01:46:00.60 --> 01:46:03.60
Probably a couple hundred of them over the two days.

2207
01:46:03.60 --> 01:46:04.60
I would say.

2208
01:46:04.60 --> 01:46:05.60
Yeah. Absolutely.

2209
01:46:05.60 --> 01:46:07.60
And you know what the crazy thing is?

2210
01:46:07.60 --> 01:46:11.60
I actually put my cell phone number and then the public.

2211
01:46:11.60 --> 01:46:12.60
Did I have to try that?

2212
01:46:12.60 --> 01:46:13.60
No.

2213
01:46:13.60 --> 01:46:15.60
Oh yeah. I'm like, hey, you're coming to camp.

2214
01:46:15.60 --> 01:46:16.60
You want to come to camp?

2215
01:46:16.60 --> 01:46:18.60
Got a question. Here's my cell phone.

2216
01:46:18.60 --> 01:46:21.60
So I usually preface it with like don't text me crazy shit.

2217
01:46:21.60 --> 01:46:23.60
Don't ask me random questions.

2218
01:46:23.60 --> 01:46:26.60
But I can answer questions about camp because I want to give.

2219
01:46:26.60 --> 01:46:29.60
I want to give people zero excuses.

2220
01:46:29.60 --> 01:46:30.60
Yeah.

2221
01:46:30.60 --> 01:46:31.60
I didn't know what to expect.

2222
01:46:31.60 --> 01:46:32.60
I didn't know who's going to be coming.

2223
01:46:32.60 --> 01:46:34.60
So the messages I got were like,

2224
01:46:34.60 --> 01:46:36.60
Hey, I listen to Jocco podcast.

2225
01:46:36.60 --> 01:46:38.60
I've never trained you, Jitsu.

2226
01:46:38.60 --> 01:46:40.60
Is this a good time to start?

2227
01:46:40.60 --> 01:46:42.60
Hey, I'm 50 years old.

2228
01:46:42.60 --> 01:46:44.60
I've never trained you, Jitsu.

2229
01:46:44.60 --> 01:46:47.60
Would it be good to come to camp or not?

2230
01:46:47.60 --> 01:46:49.60
You know, a lot of questions like that.

2231
01:46:49.60 --> 01:46:52.60
And every single one I said, I've got a bunch of people.

2232
01:46:52.60 --> 01:46:53.60
Ask them the same question.

2233
01:46:53.60 --> 01:46:54.60
We'd love to have you.

2234
01:46:54.60 --> 01:47:00.60
And it will be the greatest singular experience you will ever have in Jitsu.

2235
01:47:00.60 --> 01:47:04.60
Because you're going to be starting not just an amazing place.

2236
01:47:04.60 --> 01:47:06.60
But with amazing instructors.

2237
01:47:06.60 --> 01:47:08.60
And when I asked the first day,

2238
01:47:08.60 --> 01:47:10.60
everybody raised their hand who hasn't trained you Jitsu before.

2239
01:47:10.60 --> 01:47:12.60
Were you here at that first time?

2240
01:47:12.60 --> 01:47:17.60
We were a couple hours behind 50 people like hand up.

2241
01:47:17.60 --> 01:47:19.60
I was like, I looked at the other instructor like,

2242
01:47:19.60 --> 01:47:20.60
Holy crap.

2243
01:47:20.60 --> 01:47:22.60
If you're listening and you want to train Jitsu,

2244
01:47:22.60 --> 01:47:24.60
I do recommend that you do it.

2245
01:47:24.60 --> 01:47:25.60
There we go.

2246
01:47:25.60 --> 01:47:27.60
I do recommend it's really good for you.

2247
01:47:27.60 --> 01:47:30.60
It really is good for you in so many different ways.

2248
01:47:30.60 --> 01:47:33.60
And to see the people here that have never trained Jitsu.

2249
01:47:33.60 --> 01:47:35.60
You've got to have never trained Jitsu before.

2250
01:47:35.60 --> 01:47:40.60
And see that it's, I don't think any of us, none of us.

2251
01:47:40.60 --> 01:47:44.60
You don't ever get to see 50 people that have never trained Jitsu before.

2252
01:47:44.60 --> 01:47:46.60
Or 75 people that have never trained Jitsu before.

2253
01:47:46.60 --> 01:47:48.60
And you get to teach them all at once.

2254
01:47:48.60 --> 01:47:49.60
At least I've never done that before.

2255
01:47:49.60 --> 01:47:52.60
No, and I mean, you definitely don't get 58 year old,

2256
01:47:52.60 --> 01:47:56.60
7th and judo black belt who have never put on a Jitsu gear before.

2257
01:47:56.60 --> 01:47:58.60
You know, looking for a white belt.

2258
01:47:58.60 --> 01:47:59.60
Yeah.

2259
01:47:59.60 --> 01:48:00.60
And we've got one of them too.

2260
01:48:00.60 --> 01:48:04.60
No, it's, but my point in seeing all the people at one time.

2261
01:48:04.60 --> 01:48:07.60
You know, when you occasionally get a white belt or someone that's never trained before,

2262
01:48:07.60 --> 01:48:08.60
you teach them a couple of moves.

2263
01:48:08.60 --> 01:48:11.60
And you get to see a one spark and someone's brain.

2264
01:48:11.60 --> 01:48:14.60
Go, they start to get it.

2265
01:48:14.60 --> 01:48:16.60
But to see 50 people go,

2266
01:48:16.60 --> 01:48:18.60
it's not the eyes open up.

2267
01:48:18.60 --> 01:48:20.60
And it usually doesn't happen all at once,

2268
01:48:20.60 --> 01:48:22.60
because some people will get it when you get,

2269
01:48:22.60 --> 01:48:23.60
you know, some people make the connection here.

2270
01:48:23.60 --> 01:48:25.60
Some people make the connection over here.

2271
01:48:25.60 --> 01:48:26.60
Some people make the connection over there.

2272
01:48:26.60 --> 01:48:28.60
And it's,

2273
01:48:28.60 --> 01:48:33.60
but in a, in a period of an hour and a half training session,

2274
01:48:33.60 --> 01:48:35.60
you can definitely see people.

2275
01:48:35.60 --> 01:48:39.60
You'll see 25% of the people make a real connection.

2276
01:48:39.60 --> 01:48:46.60
And the connection is between knowing and not knowing.

2277
01:48:46.60 --> 01:48:51.60
Between between not knowing what this thing is

2278
01:48:51.60 --> 01:48:57.60
and how expansive it is and knowing what this thing is and how expansive it is.

2279
01:48:57.60 --> 01:49:00.60
And how it is so powerful.

2280
01:49:00.60 --> 01:49:02.60
I think that's the difference.

2281
01:49:02.60 --> 01:49:06.60
When somebody goes, oh, like I did it yesterday,

2282
01:49:06.60 --> 01:49:10.60
I was teaching just the mownesscape and I was teaching the mownesscape

2283
01:49:10.60 --> 01:49:14.60
with firstly, oompa, right?

2284
01:49:14.60 --> 01:49:17.60
And then going to elbow escape.

2285
01:49:17.60 --> 01:49:22.60
And as I explained, I was looking at this one girl and as I explained,

2286
01:49:22.60 --> 01:49:26.60
that as I tried to oompa them over and the person moves at the moment,

2287
01:49:26.60 --> 01:49:29.60
and the person moves out their leg to stop from being flipped over.

2288
01:49:29.60 --> 01:49:31.60
And I said, freeze.

2289
01:49:31.60 --> 01:49:33.60
And it's now look at his leg.

2290
01:49:33.60 --> 01:49:38.60
And I said, that's what I wanted and I slipped my leg out and put him in half card.

2291
01:49:38.60 --> 01:49:42.60
And I looked at her eyes and it was like, oh, yeah.

2292
01:49:42.60 --> 01:49:44.60
And her eyes got big.

2293
01:49:44.60 --> 01:49:46.60
And I was like, I looked at you and everyone's looking at you.

2294
01:49:46.60 --> 01:49:47.60
Look at her.

2295
01:49:47.60 --> 01:49:48.60
Yeah.

2296
01:49:48.60 --> 01:49:49.60
She gets it.

2297
01:49:49.60 --> 01:49:51.60
Because that's when you realize it.

2298
01:49:51.60 --> 01:49:52.60
And then you realize that all this stuff,

2299
01:49:52.60 --> 01:49:54.60
every move that you've seen over three days,

2300
01:49:54.60 --> 01:49:55.60
it's all connected.

2301
01:49:55.60 --> 01:49:57.60
It all makes sense.

2302
01:49:57.60 --> 01:50:00.60
And it's all, it's all into woven with each other

2303
01:50:00.60 --> 01:50:03.60
into this fabric that creates this thing.

2304
01:50:03.60 --> 01:50:05.60
You looked at me yesterday and you're like, hey, get me in

2305
01:50:05.60 --> 01:50:07.60
a quarter guard and I'm like, what's quarter guard?

2306
01:50:07.60 --> 01:50:10.60
Oh, you actually like, if you put a foot in whatever.

2307
01:50:10.60 --> 01:50:12.60
I didn't know, I didn't actually know it was a,

2308
01:50:12.60 --> 01:50:16.60
I just thought was like, I was the stop was that was me trying to mount you

2309
01:50:16.60 --> 01:50:18.60
or pass the guard.

2310
01:50:18.60 --> 01:50:21.60
But you showed the one, you're like, I go to D-Path.

2311
01:50:21.60 --> 01:50:22.60
And I was like, I go to D-Path from here.

2312
01:50:22.60 --> 01:50:24.60
That's what I like to do.

2313
01:50:24.60 --> 01:50:26.60
And you're like, well, let me show the move because you're moved to

2314
01:50:26.60 --> 01:50:27.60
complex.

2315
01:50:27.60 --> 01:50:29.60
I was like, yeah, they're failing at it right now.

2316
01:50:29.60 --> 01:50:33.60
And so you kind of took the control of that session.

2317
01:50:33.60 --> 01:50:37.60
And you did this move where how you got to D-Path.

2318
01:50:37.60 --> 01:50:39.60
And I was like, thinking to myself, I like that.

2319
01:50:39.60 --> 01:50:40.60
And I had one of those.

2320
01:50:40.60 --> 01:50:41.60
No.

2321
01:50:41.60 --> 01:50:44.60
And I was like, oh, stop.

2322
01:50:44.60 --> 01:50:47.60
Because you use the same clamp hip rotation.

2323
01:50:47.60 --> 01:50:49.60
I used for like one of my special sweeps.

2324
01:50:49.60 --> 01:50:51.60
And I, and I didn't, and never registered.

2325
01:50:51.60 --> 01:50:53.60
And I was like, that first thing I'm teaching like a pack

2326
01:50:53.60 --> 01:50:54.60
is that right there.

2327
01:50:54.60 --> 01:50:55.60
That's Jeff Glover.

2328
01:50:55.60 --> 01:50:58.60
That's off Jeff Glover was the head,

2329
01:50:58.60 --> 01:51:02.60
G-Jitsu instructor with Dean at my gym for four years.

2330
01:51:02.60 --> 01:51:04.60
So we do a lot of deep half guard.

2331
01:51:04.60 --> 01:51:05.60
Not enough.

2332
01:51:05.60 --> 01:51:06.60
I need more.

2333
01:51:06.60 --> 01:51:08.60
But he had some great setups there.

2334
01:51:08.60 --> 01:51:12.60
You know, and what do you seen right now moves?

2335
01:51:12.60 --> 01:51:15.60
Well, at camp one, what did everyone want to learn?

2336
01:51:15.60 --> 01:51:19.60
Well, first of all, camp one was a bloodbath.

2337
01:51:19.60 --> 01:51:22.60
Not really a bloodbath that was just came up here to beat each other.

2338
01:51:22.60 --> 01:51:27.60
Yeah, we, over camp one was, first of all, I had what belt were you in?

2339
01:51:27.60 --> 01:51:28.60
Camp one.

2340
01:51:28.60 --> 01:51:33.60
I think I was a fresh black belt.

2341
01:51:33.60 --> 01:51:36.60
I think I had, I think I just got it.

2342
01:51:36.60 --> 01:51:37.60
Yeah.

2343
01:51:37.60 --> 01:51:39.60
Because it was 2012.

2344
01:51:39.60 --> 01:51:41.60
I had just gotten back from Abu Dhabi.

2345
01:51:41.60 --> 01:51:44.60
And I was on top of my game.

2346
01:51:44.60 --> 01:51:47.60
And we had like a tanky, you know, you know,

2347
01:51:47.60 --> 01:51:48.60
Augustine, that was up here.

2348
01:51:48.60 --> 01:51:53.60
Or I fell from Eagle Barboa, so then the main crew to deck one and

2349
01:51:53.60 --> 01:51:55.60
Mackenzie Derners up here.

2350
01:51:55.60 --> 01:52:00.60
And so that that first a year.

2351
01:52:00.60 --> 01:52:02.60
We were just being up on each other.

2352
01:52:02.60 --> 01:52:06.60
This came up here to basically trade everyone's competing and whatnot.

2353
01:52:06.60 --> 01:52:07.60
Yeah.

2354
01:52:07.60 --> 01:52:12.60
And what had happened is is we had launched like,

2355
01:52:12.60 --> 01:52:14.60
K, we're bringing these experts.

2356
01:52:14.60 --> 01:52:17.60
But we had launched that after we had, you know, started to have the

2357
01:52:17.60 --> 01:52:19.60
registration right in for a while.

2358
01:52:19.60 --> 01:52:22.60
And what we saw that first year was we didn't pick up a lot of

2359
01:52:22.60 --> 01:52:25.60
extra people by having the experts.

2360
01:52:25.60 --> 01:52:26.60
Right.

2361
01:52:26.60 --> 01:52:32.60
And so people came and then we did the second year as a lot like the first

2362
01:52:32.60 --> 01:52:34.60
year, except there was more people.

2363
01:52:34.60 --> 01:52:38.60
And what we came to find out is that people were looking for

2364
01:52:38.60 --> 01:52:40.60
an experience, right?

2365
01:52:40.60 --> 01:52:43.60
Everyone's looking for something.

2366
01:52:43.60 --> 01:52:48.60
And the way that we loved you, Jitsu and how it's affected our lives.

2367
01:52:48.60 --> 01:52:51.60
It's almost like if you inject that with something extra.

2368
01:52:51.60 --> 01:52:53.60
That's what campus.

2369
01:52:53.60 --> 01:52:55.60
So Dean pointed this out to me.

2370
01:52:55.60 --> 01:52:56.60
He's up here right now.

2371
01:52:56.60 --> 01:52:57.60
Dean Lister.

2372
01:52:57.60 --> 01:53:02.60
Dean pointed out to me that in Europe, he says adults do camps.

2373
01:53:02.60 --> 01:53:05.60
Big they go to camp in America.

2374
01:53:05.60 --> 01:53:07.60
Kids go to camp.

2375
01:53:07.60 --> 01:53:09.60
And that makes sense, right?

2376
01:53:09.60 --> 01:53:12.60
I said, I'm never even dreamt of going into a camp.

2377
01:53:12.60 --> 01:53:13.60
A camp.

2378
01:53:13.60 --> 01:53:15.60
And every even dream as an adult, are you kidding me?

2379
01:53:15.60 --> 01:53:17.60
I never thought about that.

2380
01:53:17.60 --> 01:53:20.60
But in Europe, apparently, hey, it's totally normal to say, hey, you're going to go to this

2381
01:53:20.60 --> 01:53:22.60
rock climbing camp or you're an adult.

2382
01:53:22.60 --> 01:53:23.60
You're a grown person.

2383
01:53:23.60 --> 01:53:26.60
You're going to go to a gymnastics or a yoga camp or something like that.

2384
01:53:26.60 --> 01:53:29.60
Or you're going to go to a tennis camp as an adult.

2385
01:53:29.60 --> 01:53:31.60
In America, we don't do that.

2386
01:53:31.60 --> 01:53:32.60
No, we do now.

2387
01:53:32.60 --> 01:53:33.60
Yeah, we do.

2388
01:53:33.60 --> 01:53:34.60
You just do camp.

2389
01:53:34.60 --> 01:53:36.60
I'm going to get something.

2390
01:53:36.60 --> 01:53:38.60
And you know, echo when I were talking the other day.

2391
01:53:38.60 --> 01:53:40.60
And I think this is a great premise.

2392
01:53:40.60 --> 01:53:45.60
And I don't want this to sound crazy, right?

2393
01:53:45.60 --> 01:53:56.60
But imagine if the goal of the camp is to increase your skill level one belt.

2394
01:53:56.60 --> 01:54:00.60
That's actually a very good reality.

2395
01:54:00.60 --> 01:54:03.60
So it's not, it might not be realistic, right?

2396
01:54:03.60 --> 01:54:04.60
You're not going to go.

2397
01:54:04.60 --> 01:54:06.60
You're not going to gain that much skill.

2398
01:54:06.60 --> 01:54:08.60
But let me break it down.

2399
01:54:08.60 --> 01:54:11.60
Okay, your initial thought is like, no way could that happen, right?

2400
01:54:11.60 --> 01:54:12.60
You can't get that much better.

2401
01:54:12.60 --> 01:54:13.60
I sure pretty good.

2402
01:54:13.60 --> 01:54:15.60
But now I want you to think about something.

2403
01:54:15.60 --> 01:54:21.60
You train, if you come here and you train for six hours a day for seven days.

2404
01:54:21.60 --> 01:54:23.60
What do you got 42 hours?

2405
01:54:23.60 --> 01:54:25.60
You take that.

2406
01:54:25.60 --> 01:54:29.60
That's two or three months worth of training.

2407
01:54:29.60 --> 01:54:30.60
But think about this.

2408
01:54:30.60 --> 01:54:32.60
How often when you go to training?

2409
01:54:32.60 --> 01:54:34.60
Are you learning a move that you already knew?

2410
01:54:34.60 --> 01:54:39.60
Often. How often you're going to training? You're learning to move that really doesn't fit your style.

2411
01:54:39.60 --> 01:54:40.60
Often.

2412
01:54:40.60 --> 01:54:48.60
What if you came to a place where you were just going to learn the moves that you needed to improve your skill level that much?

2413
01:54:48.60 --> 01:54:53.60
Now, I think we're close. I mean, that you're going to walk out of this camp as is right now.

2414
01:54:53.60 --> 01:54:55.60
Just way better, way better.

2415
01:54:55.60 --> 01:55:03.60
I was thinking about a one time I taught a group of seals five straight days, eight hours a day.

2416
01:55:03.60 --> 01:55:05.60
For for Getsu.

2417
01:55:05.60 --> 01:55:08.60
I called it. I named it.

2418
01:55:08.60 --> 01:55:09.60
I named the course.

2419
01:55:09.60 --> 01:55:12.60
What? It was called Jaco.

2420
01:55:12.60 --> 01:55:17.60
J. A. Period O. Period C. Period K. Period O.

2421
01:55:17.60 --> 01:55:20.60
And it was it stood for.

2422
01:55:20.60 --> 01:55:25.60
Do you get to offense for combat killing operations?

2423
01:55:25.60 --> 01:55:29.60
Can't take for Getsu.

2424
01:55:29.60 --> 01:55:33.60
I was like, I don't know.

2425
01:55:33.60 --> 01:55:34.60
I was young.

2426
01:55:34.60 --> 01:55:36.60
I was 25.

2427
01:55:36.60 --> 01:55:43.60
But anyways, so what I noticed is that when I was teaching Jaco offense for combat killing operations,

2428
01:55:43.60 --> 01:55:49.60
when I was teaching that course of instruction, even though I was training guys that had never trained,

2429
01:55:49.60 --> 01:55:51.60
and I was a blue belt at the time.

2430
01:55:51.60 --> 01:55:54.60
But even though I was training guys that had never trained before,

2431
01:55:54.60 --> 01:55:58.60
I was still going to Fabio's my teacher at night.

2432
01:55:58.60 --> 01:56:03.60
And every day I got like better every day I got better.

2433
01:56:03.60 --> 01:56:06.60
And I thought to myself, oh wow, there's something to this.

2434
01:56:06.60 --> 01:56:10.60
And that's why when I would do deployments with no guys to train with,

2435
01:56:10.60 --> 01:56:12.60
I would just have my guys come in train with me.

2436
01:56:12.60 --> 01:56:15.60
You know, like, hey, you come from 12 to 12, 15, and you come from 12 to 12,

2437
01:56:15.60 --> 01:56:18.60
for change to 12, 30, and I just roll with every guy in the cartoon,

2438
01:56:18.60 --> 01:56:20.60
and just to get the mat time.

2439
01:56:20.60 --> 01:56:22.60
Because that mat time is going to help you.

2440
01:56:22.60 --> 01:56:24.60
But then if you imagine this, you take what we're doing here.

2441
01:56:24.60 --> 01:56:30.60
You have specific instruction instructors that are good at different little parts of the game.

2442
01:56:30.60 --> 01:56:34.60
And you go, oh, Alexa, can you help me with my daily life?

2443
01:56:34.60 --> 01:56:40.60
I'm going to spend the next four hours getting not a private, but a private basically.

2444
01:56:40.60 --> 01:56:43.60
Basically, from Alexa, oh, Dean Lister's here,

2445
01:56:43.60 --> 01:56:49.60
A Dean, can you show me how to finish this key look in these different positions?

2446
01:56:49.60 --> 01:56:50.60
You know what I mean?

2447
01:56:50.60 --> 01:56:54.60
Like, you could go, uh, the deco, can you look?

2448
01:56:54.60 --> 01:56:57.60
I want to, I want to sweep from butterfly guard.

2449
01:56:57.60 --> 01:56:59.60
Can you, your master at this?

2450
01:56:59.60 --> 01:57:02.60
Can you, perfect my game in that area?

2451
01:57:02.60 --> 01:57:05.60
And I think if you carved it up right,

2452
01:57:05.60 --> 01:57:08.60
you could look, are you going to get a new belt level?

2453
01:57:08.60 --> 01:57:11.60
No, but if you make that your goal to get in here and fill holes,

2454
01:57:11.60 --> 01:57:14.60
you're going to walk out of here with massive amounts of improvement.

2455
01:57:14.60 --> 01:57:15.60
You know what's incredible?

2456
01:57:15.60 --> 01:57:17.60
And that's the immersion part of it?

2457
01:57:17.60 --> 01:57:18.60
Like, it's immersion.

2458
01:57:18.60 --> 01:57:22.60
You know, people are very nervous about not so much anymore,

2459
01:57:22.60 --> 01:57:26.60
but I still get a lot of emails like, is it right for me?

2460
01:57:26.60 --> 01:57:29.60
And it's, well, we're all adults first of all.

2461
01:57:29.60 --> 01:57:34.60
So it's, there's sessions and there's opportunity outside those sessions,

2462
01:57:34.60 --> 01:57:37.60
but everyone's here for the same purpose.

2463
01:57:37.60 --> 01:57:39.60
And like I said, hey, no one's going to win a camp trophy, right?

2464
01:57:39.60 --> 01:57:44.60
It's not what's all about it is full on immersion of Jiu-Jitsu,

2465
01:57:44.60 --> 01:57:46.60
from some of the world's best.

2466
01:57:46.60 --> 01:57:51.60
But we've had people come to camp as a new blue belt.

2467
01:57:51.60 --> 01:57:54.60
They're now black belts. They still come to camp.

2468
01:57:54.60 --> 01:57:57.60
Yeah. Usually when you hit purple belt,

2469
01:57:57.60 --> 01:57:59.60
you get a bit of ego.

2470
01:57:59.60 --> 01:58:02.60
When you hit brown belt, you're basically a black belt.

2471
01:58:02.60 --> 01:58:05.60
And when you hit black belt, you think you should be sponsored.

2472
01:58:05.60 --> 01:58:10.60
That's how it goes in Jiu-Jitsu.

2473
01:58:10.60 --> 01:58:14.60
That's probably out here on the West Coast and San Diego.

2474
01:58:14.60 --> 01:58:17.60
Yeah. Like, yeah, you're not thinking that.

2475
01:58:17.60 --> 01:58:18.60
Okay.

2476
01:58:18.60 --> 01:58:19.60
You're kidding.

2477
01:58:19.60 --> 01:58:20.60
Those two are black belts.

2478
01:58:20.60 --> 01:58:22.60
Did you see all the black belts and brown belts out there?

2479
01:58:22.60 --> 01:58:23.60
That register for camp?

2480
01:58:23.60 --> 01:58:25.60
Oh yeah. Yeah. It's crazy.

2481
01:58:25.60 --> 01:58:26.60
It's crazy.

2482
01:58:26.60 --> 01:58:29.60
So it is, it's like a full immersion for all levels,

2483
01:58:29.60 --> 01:58:35.60
which it's incredible to be able to bring all the levels to camp.

2484
01:58:35.60 --> 01:58:37.60
Okay. Now this needs to be said.

2485
01:58:37.60 --> 01:58:42.60
It's also in what we would call in the military, a gentleman's course.

2486
01:58:42.60 --> 01:58:43.60
Yes.

2487
01:58:43.60 --> 01:58:45.60
Did you do the civilians know what that means?

2488
01:58:45.60 --> 01:58:46.60
Uh-huh.

2489
01:58:46.60 --> 01:58:54.60
The difference. Okay. In the military, a normal course of instruction means you're going to go and you're going to be basically treated like crap.

2490
01:58:54.60 --> 01:58:56.60
And you're going to do crappy things.

2491
01:58:56.60 --> 01:58:59.60
And it's like, hey, we're going to make you understand this.

2492
01:58:59.60 --> 01:59:02.60
A gentleman's course, like, okay, look, we're going to get the material covered.

2493
01:59:02.60 --> 01:59:04.60
You're going to get treated like the grown man.

2494
01:59:04.60 --> 01:59:06.60
Or in this case, growing woman.

2495
01:59:06.60 --> 01:59:08.60
You're not going to be treated like a child.

2496
01:59:08.60 --> 01:59:10.60
So that, so this place is a gentleman's course.

2497
01:59:10.60 --> 01:59:14.60
It's not like, hey, you will be, if you want to skip a session here,

2498
01:59:14.60 --> 01:59:15.60
skip a session.

2499
01:59:15.60 --> 01:59:17.60
You don't want to do take down.

2500
01:59:17.60 --> 01:59:19.60
Oh, don't do take down.

2501
01:59:19.60 --> 01:59:22.60
You don't, you want to relax in the morning and don't want to do the morning session.

2502
01:59:22.60 --> 01:59:26.60
Or you want to stay up on the mat all night and get on vampire hours.

2503
01:59:26.60 --> 01:59:27.60
Get something.

2504
01:59:27.60 --> 01:59:28.60
I got on vampire hours.

2505
01:59:28.60 --> 01:59:29.60
That's, yeah, I know two way.

2506
01:59:29.60 --> 01:59:30.60
Yeah, every morning.

2507
01:59:30.60 --> 01:59:32.60
So, so it's a gentleman's course.

2508
01:59:32.60 --> 01:59:36.60
And, and you can come here and you can pick and choose what you want to do.

2509
01:59:36.60 --> 01:59:38.60
If you, there's people here that I thought this was cool.

2510
01:59:38.60 --> 01:59:42.60
People here that are injured that cannot roll, but they're here.

2511
01:59:42.60 --> 01:59:44.60
And they're learning moves and they're drilling as much as they can.

2512
01:59:44.60 --> 01:59:48.60
And then cool, they're going to go home and use them live when they can use them live.

2513
01:59:48.60 --> 01:59:52.60
So that parts, that parts pretty cool.

2514
01:59:52.60 --> 01:59:55.60
Uh, one, I want to go, I hate to drag you back this, but move.

2515
01:59:55.60 --> 01:59:59.60
Do you remember moves like from seven years ago that people were looking at.

2516
01:59:59.60 --> 02:00:01.60
Compared to now.

2517
02:00:01.60 --> 02:00:05.60
Any, anything, does anything jump out of you or am I just talking up on their own trick?

2518
02:00:05.60 --> 02:00:06.60
No, totally.

2519
02:00:06.60 --> 02:00:10.60
Totally. I mean, I remember standing there.

2520
02:00:10.60 --> 02:00:13.60
I remember sitting in the stands watching,

2521
02:00:13.60 --> 02:00:17.60
Hodger Gracie choke everybody out from Mount.

2522
02:00:17.60 --> 02:00:22.60
Every single person in the pyramid at the World Championships.

2523
02:00:22.60 --> 02:00:26.60
And thinking that's, and I was young, young, you know,

2524
02:00:26.60 --> 02:00:28.60
belt and I'm thinking like, all that's real, Gigiitsu.

2525
02:00:28.60 --> 02:00:33.60
Then I remember the men, des brothers, barren, bow-loing, everybody.

2526
02:00:33.60 --> 02:00:35.60
And then thinking like, well, maybe that's Gigiitsu.

2527
02:00:35.60 --> 02:00:40.60
You know, but as you progress, you come to find out it's all Gigiitsu and it's all cyclical.

2528
02:00:40.60 --> 02:00:41.60
And that's the bottom line.

2529
02:00:41.60 --> 02:00:47.60
There's a cycle of Gigiitsu and things, you know, your body can only do certain things.

2530
02:00:47.60 --> 02:00:50.60
Right? You can only, you can't bend your elbow backwards.

2531
02:00:50.60 --> 02:00:52.60
You know, there's, you have some resilience.

2532
02:00:52.60 --> 02:00:58.60
You build up some resilience to different things, but it's a, it's the cyclical thing.

2533
02:00:58.60 --> 02:01:04.60
And I've seen things that came and then were defended and then changed.

2534
02:01:04.60 --> 02:01:08.60
Like the daily he would guard.

2535
02:01:08.60 --> 02:01:10.60
I love the daily he would guard.

2536
02:01:10.60 --> 02:01:15.60
And it's coming back, you know.

2537
02:01:15.60 --> 02:01:19.60
And, and, and it's the first time the first time I've seen it come back is when that,

2538
02:01:19.60 --> 02:01:24.60
that new kid swept Bouchesha with a straight up daily he was sweet.

2539
02:01:24.60 --> 02:01:27.60
Who's that kid that's coming on the scene hardcore now?

2540
02:01:27.60 --> 02:01:28.60
Oh, right.

2541
02:01:28.60 --> 02:01:31.60
Um, man, grab Marigali, Marigali.

2542
02:01:31.60 --> 02:01:39.60
Yeah. But as far as moves for me, I always stick to the basics like, you know,

2543
02:01:39.60 --> 02:01:44.60
make them skate on ice when you're on bottom and put them under the ice when you're on top.

2544
02:01:44.60 --> 02:01:46.60
And I just try to stick to those two things and, you know,

2545
02:01:46.60 --> 02:01:49.60
moves come or go, but, you know, the concepts stay the same.

2546
02:01:49.60 --> 02:01:54.60
They don't ever change concepts and just do conceptually nothing ever changes.

2547
02:01:54.60 --> 02:01:55.60
You're trying to do something.

2548
02:01:55.60 --> 02:01:56.60
Yeah.

2549
02:01:56.60 --> 02:01:57.60
It's like the laws of combat.

2550
02:01:57.60 --> 02:01:58.60
Okay.

2551
02:01:58.60 --> 02:02:01.60
The concepts don't change. Covered moves cover and move.

2552
02:02:01.60 --> 02:02:04.60
Big and it's off balancing someone.

2553
02:02:04.60 --> 02:02:04.60
Yeah.

2554
02:02:04.60 --> 02:02:05.60
Putting them off balance.

2555
02:02:05.60 --> 02:02:06.60
Right.

2556
02:02:06.60 --> 02:02:12.60
What when you see different people teach what type of instruction do you think works best for you personally,

2557
02:02:12.60 --> 02:02:13.60
Pete Roberts?

2558
02:02:13.60 --> 02:02:17.60
For me, I want clear concise.

2559
02:02:17.60 --> 02:02:21.60
Uh, just straightforward show me once.

2560
02:02:21.60 --> 02:02:25.60
Do you like to see the move?

2561
02:02:25.60 --> 02:02:31.60
Like like individual moves or do you like to understand the broader concept?

2562
02:02:31.60 --> 02:02:33.60
I'm a concept guy.

2563
02:02:33.60 --> 02:02:34.60
I'm serious.

2564
02:02:34.60 --> 02:02:36.60
Because my artsy artsy, very mind.

2565
02:02:36.60 --> 02:02:38.60
But I like the concepts of it.

2566
02:02:38.60 --> 02:02:39.60
Yeah.

2567
02:02:39.60 --> 02:02:40.60
And it's weird.

2568
02:02:40.60 --> 02:02:44.60
And that's one thing that's good about this is you have some of the instructors teach.

2569
02:02:44.60 --> 02:02:48.60
Here's the, here's move one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

2570
02:02:48.60 --> 02:02:50.60
That's the move.

2571
02:02:50.60 --> 02:02:52.60
You do these seven things.

2572
02:02:52.60 --> 02:02:53.60
That's the move.

2573
02:02:53.60 --> 02:02:57.60
Other teachers here are like, here's what you're trying to do first.

2574
02:02:57.60 --> 02:02:59.60
There's what you're trying to do second.

2575
02:02:59.60 --> 02:03:01.60
Here's what you're trying to do third.

2576
02:03:01.60 --> 02:03:02.60
It's probably going to cause this to happen.

2577
02:03:02.60 --> 02:03:04.60
And when that happens, here's what you're going to do with it.

2578
02:03:04.60 --> 02:03:05.60
It's a linear system.

2579
02:03:05.60 --> 02:03:07.60
And I look at the jutsu non-linear.

2580
02:03:07.60 --> 02:03:08.60
Yeah.

2581
02:03:08.60 --> 02:03:11.60
But it's okay to look at linear two because some people that's their learning skills,

2582
02:03:11.60 --> 02:03:12.60
I'm saying that.

2583
02:03:12.60 --> 02:03:14.60
That's why I'm saying this is some people.

2584
02:03:14.60 --> 02:03:17.60
I give them the concept and then they say, because I'm a,

2585
02:03:17.60 --> 02:03:19.60
I'm a conceptual teacher.

2586
02:03:19.60 --> 02:03:20.60
Yeah.

2587
02:03:20.60 --> 02:03:22.60
I give them the concept and they say, okay, where do I grab?

2588
02:03:22.60 --> 02:03:23.60
Exactly.

2589
02:03:23.60 --> 02:03:24.60
Exactly.

2590
02:03:24.60 --> 02:03:27.60
And as soon as they asked me that, I realized, I say, okay, grab here.

2591
02:03:27.60 --> 02:03:28.60
Mm-hmm.

2592
02:03:28.60 --> 02:03:31.60
Other hand here, foot here.

2593
02:03:31.60 --> 02:03:33.60
Push, pull, lean.

2594
02:03:33.60 --> 02:03:34.60
There it is.

2595
02:03:34.60 --> 02:03:36.60
That's why I'm a shitty teacher.

2596
02:03:36.60 --> 02:03:37.60
Mm-hmm.

2597
02:03:37.60 --> 02:03:42.60
Well, you're only a shitty teacher to people that aren't that don't learn the way you do.

2598
02:03:42.60 --> 02:03:43.60
Exactly.

2599
02:03:43.60 --> 02:03:44.60
Exactly.

2600
02:03:44.60 --> 02:03:47.60
So, like that, I think that's good to have people.

2601
02:03:47.60 --> 02:03:50.60
I mean, how long you've been training for?

2602
02:03:50.60 --> 02:03:52.60
Uh, 2006.

2603
02:03:52.60 --> 02:03:53.60
I started.

2604
02:03:53.60 --> 02:03:55.60
So, 12, 12 years.

2605
02:03:55.60 --> 02:03:56.60
12 years.

2606
02:03:56.60 --> 02:04:03.60
You've been training 12 years and I showed a move that you were a black belt when I was, you know,

2607
02:04:03.60 --> 02:04:05.60
in diapers and jiu-jitsu.

2608
02:04:05.60 --> 02:04:10.60
So, I showed a move that you didn't see in 12 years, right?

2609
02:04:10.60 --> 02:04:11.60
You showed a move.

2610
02:04:11.60 --> 02:04:16.60
I've been training for a long, longer, 20, something years.

2611
02:04:16.60 --> 02:04:17.60
And you showed move.

2612
02:04:17.60 --> 02:04:18.60
I didn't.

2613
02:04:18.60 --> 02:04:19.60
Never seen before.

2614
02:04:19.60 --> 02:04:22.60
Is that mean I need to expose myself to more?

2615
02:04:22.60 --> 02:04:23.60
Yes.

2616
02:04:23.60 --> 02:04:24.60
But it also means, guess what?

2617
02:04:24.60 --> 02:04:25.60
There's only so much knowledge.

2618
02:04:25.60 --> 02:04:30.60
And what's cool about this is the moves get filtered by human beings, right?

2619
02:04:30.60 --> 02:04:35.60
You're not out there teaching a move that you haven't used and don't feel good about.

2620
02:04:35.60 --> 02:04:41.60
Whereas, there could be moves that you can learn like all that person's never actually used that move before.

2621
02:04:41.60 --> 02:04:42.60
Mm-hmm.

2622
02:04:42.60 --> 02:04:44.60
So, things to be interested.

2623
02:04:44.60 --> 02:04:48.60
You know, you talked about immersion and an explain this to everyone.

2624
02:04:48.60 --> 02:04:49.60
I don't know if I've ever heard.

2625
02:04:49.60 --> 02:04:53.60
Have I ever done a language-comparative language to on this podcast?

2626
02:04:53.60 --> 02:04:55.60
Oh, on this podcast, I don't know.

2627
02:04:55.60 --> 02:04:56.60
Okay.

2628
02:04:56.60 --> 02:04:57.60
I don't know either.

2629
02:04:57.60 --> 02:05:03.60
For people that want to learn jiu-jitsu, this is an immersion camp, but no matter where you're learning it.

2630
02:05:03.60 --> 02:05:04.60
This is great.

2631
02:05:04.60 --> 02:05:05.60
I know what you're going to say.

2632
02:05:05.60 --> 02:05:06.60
That's the language thing.

2633
02:05:06.60 --> 02:05:08.60
I really got me when you said this.

2634
02:05:08.60 --> 02:05:09.60
Okay.

2635
02:05:09.60 --> 02:05:12.60
So, here's what it is to learn jiu-jitsu.

2636
02:05:12.60 --> 02:05:14.60
You know, I compares to learning a language.

2637
02:05:14.60 --> 02:05:17.60
I was an English major.

2638
02:05:17.60 --> 02:05:23.60
So, and I studied linguistics inside of studying English.

2639
02:05:23.60 --> 02:05:26.60
Learning a language and learning jiu-jitsu are very similar.

2640
02:05:26.60 --> 02:05:33.60
When you, so when echo, who echo gives a great introductory course to jiu-jitsu, it's like what you teach?

2641
02:05:33.60 --> 02:05:35.60
Mount, you teach all the positions.

2642
02:05:35.60 --> 02:05:39.60
Mount, back, half-guard, guard, sign-mo.

2643
02:05:39.60 --> 02:05:40.60
Side control.

2644
02:05:40.60 --> 02:05:43.60
And you teach a little bit of action from each one.

2645
02:05:43.60 --> 02:05:45.60
Maybe one or two submissions from one or two.

2646
02:05:45.60 --> 02:05:47.60
One or two escapes from one or two.

2647
02:05:47.60 --> 02:05:52.60
So, it's a total of five positions and seven moves.

2648
02:05:52.60 --> 02:05:54.60
Let's say something like that.

2649
02:05:54.60 --> 02:06:00.60
When he gets done teaching that introduction, and it's actually the same introduction that I basically teach.

2650
02:06:00.60 --> 02:06:04.60
And when I've taught it, the master of the zoo, when I first said this, so at the master, I said,

2651
02:06:04.60 --> 02:06:07.60
when we got done with this hour and a half, and they're all these people are all fired up,

2652
02:06:07.60 --> 02:06:09.60
because they know how to do the Americana.

2653
02:06:09.60 --> 02:06:11.60
They know how to do the re-arrunaked choke.

2654
02:06:11.60 --> 02:06:15.60
And they're basically in their minds trained killers.

2655
02:06:15.60 --> 02:06:17.60
I guess probably, you know, absolutely.

2656
02:06:17.60 --> 02:06:28.60
And when we get done with that, I say, okay, you have just learned the one line that forms the small letter A that goes down the side.

2657
02:06:28.60 --> 02:06:29.60
You only learn that.

2658
02:06:29.60 --> 02:06:32.60
You haven't even actually learned the letter A yet.

2659
02:06:32.60 --> 02:06:33.60
Exactly.

2660
02:06:33.60 --> 02:06:36.60
In terms of looking at his language, you train for another few hours.

2661
02:06:36.60 --> 02:06:38.60
You might have an A, right?

2662
02:06:38.60 --> 02:06:41.60
And then you, then, okay, now, but can you speak a sentence?

2663
02:06:41.60 --> 02:06:42.60
Nope.

2664
02:06:42.60 --> 02:06:43.60
You can't even form a word yet.

2665
02:06:43.60 --> 02:06:44.60
There's one word you can form.

2666
02:06:44.60 --> 02:06:45.60
It's A.

2667
02:06:45.60 --> 02:06:47.60
You got one word.

2668
02:06:47.60 --> 02:06:48.60
That's basically where you're at.

2669
02:06:48.60 --> 02:06:52.60
So what you need to do is you need to learn more moves.

2670
02:06:52.60 --> 02:06:56.60
But once you learn different, you couldn't just learn letters, you need to learn how to spell.

2671
02:06:56.60 --> 02:06:58.60
That's how you put the move moves together.

2672
02:06:58.60 --> 02:07:04.60
And then you got to learn how to fit those moves together in, against and alongside other moves.

2673
02:07:04.60 --> 02:07:06.60
That's a sentence.

2674
02:07:06.60 --> 02:07:10.60
And then you got to figure out how you're going to roll through a paragraph.

2675
02:07:10.60 --> 02:07:13.60
And then you put in these moves together.

2676
02:07:13.60 --> 02:07:16.60
Then you realize that it's also like language.

2677
02:07:16.60 --> 02:07:17.60
It's like the bait.

2678
02:07:17.60 --> 02:07:21.60
You're actually somebody's throwing other words that you and you need to learn how to respond to.

2679
02:07:21.60 --> 02:07:25.60
And once you learn all those words and you learn how to put them in a paragraph.

2680
02:07:25.60 --> 02:07:26.60
And you get to end of that.

2681
02:07:26.60 --> 02:07:28.60
And you think you've mastered the language.

2682
02:07:28.60 --> 02:07:30.60
Then someone says, hey, guess what?

2683
02:07:30.60 --> 02:07:32.60
You've got to learn German.

2684
02:07:32.60 --> 02:07:33.60
Yeah.

2685
02:07:33.60 --> 02:07:35.60
Which is, you know, judo.

2686
02:07:35.60 --> 02:07:37.60
And then you got to learn sombo, which is Russian.

2687
02:07:37.60 --> 02:07:39.60
And you got to learn all these different languages.

2688
02:07:39.60 --> 02:07:43.60
You got to learn all these different languages in order to really truly understand.

2689
02:07:43.60 --> 02:07:46.60
And I feel like I feel like black belt for me.

2690
02:07:46.60 --> 02:07:52.60
Like getting to black belt was the start of that was like okay, the English language.

2691
02:07:52.60 --> 02:07:56.60
But I felt my grammar still sucks.

2692
02:07:56.60 --> 02:07:59.60
Yeah, I feel like we're going to get to those other languages yet.

2693
02:07:59.60 --> 02:08:04.60
I feel like from the language perspective, when you get your black belt, you have the language capability of like a ten.

2694
02:08:04.60 --> 02:08:07.60
You're not going to be able to just pick up a book and start reading it.

2695
02:08:07.60 --> 02:08:09.60
You're not going to be able to do that.

2696
02:08:09.60 --> 02:08:12.60
You have to be, you know, one of these guys that has been training and teaching for a really long time and competing is.

2697
02:08:12.60 --> 02:08:15.60
And though, and really have like a broad mind.

2698
02:08:15.60 --> 02:08:19.60
And you know what's crazy is I, you know what, we got the plastic forks in the comments.

2699
02:08:19.60 --> 02:08:21.60
Someone has asked me what the stripes mean.

2700
02:08:21.60 --> 02:08:25.60
And so I took out the plastic forks and I had lined them up.

2701
02:08:25.60 --> 02:08:26.60
And I was like, what do you think?

2702
02:08:26.60 --> 02:08:27.60
I'm going to be able to do that.

2703
02:08:27.60 --> 02:08:28.60
And I'm going to be able to do that.

2704
02:08:28.60 --> 02:08:29.60
And I'm going to be able to do that.

2705
02:08:29.60 --> 02:08:30.60
And I'm going to be able to do that.

2706
02:08:30.60 --> 02:08:34.60
And I just drive's mean. And so I took out the plastic forks and I lined them up.

2707
02:08:34.60 --> 02:08:36.60
I said that's three years of black belt.

2708
02:08:36.60 --> 02:08:38.60
That's three years of black belt first too.

2709
02:08:38.60 --> 02:08:40.60
The next one, that's five years, that's five years.

2710
02:08:40.60 --> 02:08:42.60
That's seven years and that's seven.

2711
02:08:42.60 --> 02:08:44.60
I said, so when you look at someone,

2712
02:08:44.60 --> 02:08:46.60
you can see how long they've been a black belt.

2713
02:08:46.60 --> 02:08:50.60
Because their question was, are there differences in black belts?

2714
02:08:50.60 --> 02:08:53.60
Absolutely, there's differences.

2715
02:08:53.60 --> 02:08:57.60
Most of these guys have been black belts in World Champion.

2716
02:08:57.60 --> 02:09:04.88
champion and have a hundred black belts when I just started training GJ2. So go to them.

2717
02:09:04.88 --> 02:09:10.72
They've got the knowledge. I'm still trying to learn that. Yeah. Yeah. For sure. And there are,

2718
02:09:10.72 --> 02:09:17.12
I mean, there's as much disparity in black belts as there are from white to brown belt. Yeah.

2719
02:09:17.12 --> 02:09:25.44
There's, there's that much difference. Absolutely. All right. Cool. I think I think that's a good place

2720
02:09:25.44 --> 02:09:35.60
to wrap it. Wrap it. Um, speaking of wrapping up. Echo Charles. Yes. You didn't even jump into that.

2721
02:09:35.60 --> 02:09:40.88
You did through conversation very much. You guys are nailing it on the head every single time. No,

2722
02:09:40.88 --> 02:09:47.52
like, I mean, I had every single time. And it's like not every single time. I would just say every time.

2723
02:09:47.52 --> 02:09:51.12
I got it, you know, in the spirit of how much to work. How much torture. So for those of you

2724
02:09:51.12 --> 02:09:57.84
don't know, Echo Charles has a, a, a, a call to broken wing. You would have a broken wing. We got that by

2725
02:09:57.84 --> 02:10:06.08
covering injury recovering. How much torture was it to be here without rolling? It was like, um,

2726
02:10:07.20 --> 02:10:12.88
like a broke. You know, when you torture someone, then they break. Oh, I broke. Yeah. The other day.

2727
02:10:12.88 --> 02:10:18.96
So actually rolled two rounds. I didn't re-injure it or nothing like this, but

2728
02:10:18.96 --> 02:10:24.16
you definitely felt it. I heard it just from all the twisting activity. So it's like,

2729
02:10:24.16 --> 02:10:28.96
but I feel it is just one of those hurt things. It'll be fine. Absolutely fine. But yeah,

2730
02:10:28.96 --> 02:10:34.16
tortures too. Or as far as the degree, whatever degree it takes to break. That's me.

2731
02:10:34.16 --> 02:10:38.24
Let's definitely different. Different people. Yes, it is. So, uh, well,

2732
02:10:39.12 --> 02:10:43.04
maybe we're not going to torture anyone, but if we want to help them instead of torture,

2733
02:10:43.04 --> 02:10:49.12
yeah, maybe you could, you know, close and then how to do that. Demonstrable actually, what, illustrate. No,

2734
02:10:49.12 --> 02:10:54.32
illustrate. No, illustrate is also explained. Yeah, like, you could paint a picture if you will. You

2735
02:10:54.32 --> 02:10:59.12
can metaphor. All right. Let's do it. Okay. Let's talk about origin first. Like we always do that.

2736
02:10:59.12 --> 02:11:05.60
By the way, it's awesome. Pete, since you're here, what do you think? What do I think? What do you think about

2737
02:11:05.60 --> 02:11:11.68
origin? It is like, you know, you know anything about this or what? I know a little bit about it.

2738
02:11:11.68 --> 02:11:17.52
Yeah. I've been involved for a little while. What do you want to talk about with origin? Okay.

2739
02:11:17.52 --> 02:11:22.64
And the whole podcast is kind of like a stressful. Yeah. What we haven't done this before. Okay.

2740
02:11:23.36 --> 02:11:27.76
New person hasn't trained your juts before. Need a key. What do you want you to get? Well,

2741
02:11:27.76 --> 02:11:33.68
there's only one. To get one. What specific? That is, uh, never trained your juts to come.

2742
02:11:33.68 --> 02:11:42.16
I'll get a, get a, uh, compethletic key. Okay. So, so there's levels of keys. We make a key here in the United

2743
02:11:42.16 --> 02:11:49.92
States from American Girl and Cotton and you've heard echo said before. A key is a tool you need to

2744
02:11:49.92 --> 02:11:55.84
start your journey. Most schools are going to require you to have one. Normally, if you start an

2745
02:11:55.84 --> 02:12:00.48
MMA school, you're going to start with a rash guard and some shorts. But if you're going to go

2746
02:12:00.48 --> 02:12:06.56
try jutsu and I would recommend, you know, trying it in the key first, you're going to need a key.

2747
02:12:06.56 --> 02:12:13.36
And that right there is, is a tool you're going to use in your journey. It's not just something

2748
02:12:13.36 --> 02:12:18.72
you wear and it's actually a tool. It's actually something you're going to grip and hold and turn

2749
02:12:18.72 --> 02:12:24.88
and twist. And when you're doing that or when someone's doing that to you, you need the best tool.

2750
02:12:24.88 --> 02:12:29.44
And that's what we make up here in Maine are the best tools for training. And the form of it just

2751
02:12:29.44 --> 02:12:35.52
happens to be a key. So, someone's never trained before. Compa athletic, calm, athletic, calm, athletic.

2752
02:12:35.52 --> 02:12:40.72
Calm, athletic. So, I did it in like portrait. I made it. The portrait is ATLAT. So, it's athletic.

2753
02:12:40.72 --> 02:12:46.000
Right. You just said, I thought you said that. I say athletic. Okay. Because it means athlete. So,

2754
02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:50.72
calm, athlete, calm, athletic. Yeah, that's that. Ortee. Yeah, it's a little little bit of top.

2755
02:12:50.72 --> 02:12:55.92
Hey, but that's not like a hard and fast. Like, hey, if you're just beginning, you should get this.

2756
02:12:55.92 --> 02:13:00.48
It's kind of, that's kind of like you're just recommendation. Right. Because I use it too.

2757
02:13:00.48 --> 02:13:05.04
I use the athletic. I'm going to have an axiom too. I mean, the axiom is like next level.

2758
02:13:05.04 --> 02:13:09.60
Like if you're serious about training, like you're going to commit to it, like you're really going to commit to it.

2759
02:13:09.60 --> 02:13:13.52
You need to get an axiom. So, if you're compared to like a surfboard, right? I mean,

2760
02:13:13.52 --> 02:13:18.80
I'm assuming you start surfing and you get the, you know, like you're watching or short. Remember that?

2761
02:13:18.80 --> 02:13:21.12
This is a surfboard. You have watching or short?

2762
02:13:21.12 --> 02:13:26.32
Yeah, okay. I have, but I haven't seen the long time. Okay. So, he wanted to ride.

2763
02:13:26.32 --> 02:13:29.76
What's the board? He, I forget. You ever watched North Shore? No. Oh, dang too bad.

2764
02:13:29.76 --> 02:13:35.12
Yeah. That's, that's cool. Anyway, so this kid, Rick Kane, for a, if they, if surfers,

2765
02:13:35.12 --> 02:13:39.92
well, if any surfers listening, we'll be like, yeah, North Shore is cheesy. I get it. I know man.

2766
02:13:39.92 --> 02:13:45.52
But you can't, the point. The point. The point. I'm not in the loop. It's okay. Welcome to Echo's podcast.

2767
02:13:45.52 --> 02:13:52.000
You're not in the loop. Rick Kane wins a surfing competition in Arizona in the tank.

2768
02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:55.60
Yeah. Go so wide because you're going to surf the big ways. You get this trainer old school,

2769
02:13:55.60 --> 02:14:00.88
soul surfer type guy. Who plays that? Jerry Lopez. No, no. Jerry Lopez is Vince on the kind of

2770
02:14:00.88 --> 02:14:06.72
the rival of the local. Anyway, that's a different point. So, he kind of at one point, this is

2771
02:14:06.72 --> 02:14:11.36
a small kind of small part of the movie, but he wants to use this like special board that his trainer

2772
02:14:11.36 --> 02:14:16.40
kind of shapes or or had or whatever. And he's like, right, you know, ready for that. Yeah. It's not like that,

2773
02:14:16.40 --> 02:14:17.68
right? You seem to know. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

2774
02:14:17.68 --> 02:14:23.44
like that. Because you could get an axiom day one. Yeah. We have people that do. Yeah. They'll listen to your podcast.

2775
02:14:23.44 --> 02:14:28.08
No, but like I got started to do any the best. What? Yeah. Cool. That is the, the axioms

2776
02:14:28.08 --> 02:14:33.92
comfortable as can be. But we read, we're reinventing the key again for next year. Yeah. Yeah. We

2777
02:14:33.92 --> 02:14:38.32
are doing that well. No, I know we mentioned it. Yeah. But you do really good things like, um, like the

2778
02:14:38.32 --> 02:14:42.96
pants, for example. Yeah. Like, you know a regular, I don't know regular, whatever. The different kind

2779
02:14:42.96 --> 02:14:48.80
of key trash bags style pants versus you know mapping body mapping pants. Yeah. That's a big deal.

2780
02:14:48.80 --> 02:14:53.60
Yes. That's really what set us apart initially. Yeah. I could see why it's really why we

2781
02:14:54.24 --> 02:14:58.72
one of the reasons we decided to bring manufacturing back is because when every time we come

2782
02:14:58.72 --> 02:15:02.96
up with something to get ripped off, our manufacturers send it over overseas and have to give it

2783
02:15:02.96 --> 02:15:09.76
somebody else in the pants is a huge, huge thing for better training. Yeah. Holy. Also speaking

2784
02:15:09.76 --> 02:15:15.04
of pants joggers. Okay. I don't know if I said this before. I told some guys earlier today or yes,

2785
02:15:15.84 --> 02:15:18.88
you know joggers. I don't know if you remember this last year. You were like, oh yeah. And

2786
02:15:18.88 --> 02:15:22.96
I hear some here's some joggers or whatever. I'll say you know, it's like joggers. You know,

2787
02:15:22.96 --> 02:15:27.36
isn't that the slim fit? You know, and you're like, yeah, I saw like whatever, you know,

2788
02:15:27.36 --> 02:15:31.04
origin, I'm going to represent it put them on. Then what pizza did I didn't tell you this talk?

2789
02:15:31.04 --> 02:15:35.60
He goes, he goes, yeah, you know, it is more of a stylish thing. He's like, you can pull it off.

2790
02:15:35.60 --> 02:15:43.52
I was like, ooh, thanks, bro. You can. And truly, truly, 100% true. Now, I like I have joggers. I'm kind

2791
02:15:43.52 --> 02:15:48.16
of into joggers. No, I even bought pants that weren't sweat pants that were that jogger style.

2792
02:15:48.16 --> 02:15:53.36
And I'm not joking. Yeah. I came to me on the mat. He's like, hey, man, I was hoping you'd signed

2793
02:15:53.36 --> 02:15:59.52
this book for me. But I got to tell you, I bought joggers yesterday. I was like, I can't do it.

2794
02:15:59.52 --> 02:16:03.52
Well, it's not signing. You can't say that after I signed it, but it's not. But the thing is,

2795
02:16:03.52 --> 02:16:08.40
they're not only, okay, so you have joggers, which I did, because if you do really jog in them,

2796
02:16:08.40 --> 02:16:12.64
like they are, it's like they're ergonomically kind of made for actual jogging, because they don't

2797
02:16:12.64 --> 02:16:16.80
flap on the bottom or whatever, and they give you room in the depth of difference between joggers and

2798
02:16:16.80 --> 02:16:22.56
the sweats or something. Yeah, what if I'm not mat, just the shape. So, and this, I'm just assuming

2799
02:16:22.56 --> 02:16:26.72
that's not what the shape is different. But what is the difference? They're more on the thing. Yeah,

2800
02:16:26.72 --> 02:16:31.04
they're slimmer on the legs, and then usually they're a little bit more roomy in the hips, right?

2801
02:16:31.04 --> 02:16:34.80
Like in the, are the knees roomy at all? Mm.

2802
02:16:36.80 --> 02:16:42.32
That's good. That's good. That's good. Any more roomy for me? I get it. Yeah. Anyway,

2803
02:16:43.20 --> 02:16:48.40
they're functionally sound is what I'm saying. Yeah. But you add that in which I've said this,

2804
02:16:48.40 --> 02:16:54.000
I don't know what Rachel caught into whatever you guys are using, but I've named them officially,

2805
02:16:54.000 --> 02:16:57.92
by the way. Okay, I have the most comfortable pants in the world. The most comfortable pants in the

2806
02:16:57.92 --> 02:17:01.04
world. The most comfortable pants in the world. Do what I'm taking that? Can I take that?

2807
02:17:01.04 --> 02:17:06.32
It's yours. Do the men? You know what goes good with the joggers is our hoodies, and you know,

2808
02:17:08.32 --> 02:17:12.72
I tell you why I walked in last night, to the training. It was last night. That's like,

2809
02:17:12.72 --> 02:17:16.96
oh, a jogger, it's wearing a hoodie. And I was like, and that was on the other side of the room,

2810
02:17:16.96 --> 02:17:21.92
and I was like, that's a good looking hoodie here alone. And I was like, but it's all black. I was like,

2811
02:17:21.92 --> 02:17:29.28
what the frick is he wearing? I was like, he brought a hoodie. I had a different hoodie.

2812
02:17:29.28 --> 02:17:32.96
And then I started walking closer, and then you started coming over and I was like, oh,

2813
02:17:32.96 --> 02:17:38.56
it's a black on black origin hoodie. Yeah. I was like, that was pretty badass. Yeah.

2814
02:17:38.56 --> 02:17:43.60
I keep hoodies for a really long time. Yeah. Like t-shirts. Only they don't wear out as

2815
02:17:43.60 --> 02:17:48.56
quick, right? So you can wear out any for a long time. That new hoodie we've developed though out of the

2816
02:17:48.56 --> 02:17:52.24
infinity fleece. That's probably going to be a lot. Let's be eating it on the other

2817
02:17:52.24 --> 02:17:57.76
than last forever. Uh, one ounce we got. We got supplements. Some joint warfare.

2818
02:17:58.96 --> 02:18:08.72
Some creloil. Some discipline. Did you know that joint warfare for origin is the top selling product

2819
02:18:09.68 --> 02:18:14.40
across the board when it comes to like all jujitsu, all nutrition, everything we make.

2820
02:18:14.40 --> 02:18:20.64
The joint warfare has the greatest impact on humanity than any other product. Makes sense.

2821
02:18:20.64 --> 02:18:26.40
It's an unbelievable. It's unbelievable. Yeah. No, people are into it myself included.

2822
02:18:26.40 --> 02:18:31.68
My something. And you know, uh, be little was telling me that I love how we call

2823
02:18:31.68 --> 02:18:38.96
it be little. When you say that, what it does to my brain, I mean, it's like eating ice cream.

2824
02:18:38.96 --> 02:18:46.16
Just say be little one time moving. Yeah. Just no, I was talking to be little. But just now I just caught

2825
02:18:46.16 --> 02:18:51.52
that like she little like, okay, it's be period little, right? You know, you sure. Right now I've

2826
02:18:51.52 --> 02:18:55.76
just caught the fact that it's like the same is like be little like you're belittling somebody.

2827
02:18:55.76 --> 02:19:00.88
Oh, I just caught that right now. I didn't know. I thought that that's why it was so funny. I didn't know.

2828
02:19:00.88 --> 02:19:06.08
I just got it. I was so funny. Why did you even think it was funny without knowing that it was

2829
02:19:06.08 --> 02:19:13.68
be little because I thought it made him the small. Oh, I'm physically small. Be little. Yeah. Yeah.

2830
02:19:13.68 --> 02:19:19.12
Yeah. Like be like because because his name was you could be strong. You could be little exactly.

2831
02:19:19.12 --> 02:19:22.72
Or you could be little. So I was like, it's like you tell him basically little.

2832
02:19:22.72 --> 02:19:27.92
Yeah. I always thought of it as like be little like I'm a little bit of you.

2833
02:19:29.76 --> 02:19:34.64
Dude, you know, the great. I had someone call it to be a camp. We were in the cafeteria like one of the first days

2834
02:19:34.64 --> 02:19:39.68
and he comes up to me and he's kind of got his head down a lot of business like hey,

2835
02:19:39.68 --> 02:19:43.20
I was like hey, and I thought he's in a say something like it's great to meet you because that's

2836
02:19:43.20 --> 02:19:47.28
you know my ego whatever and he's like is be little here.

2837
02:19:49.52 --> 02:19:54.72
It's like yes he is. So glad you asked that. Anyways, what were you talking about be little.

2838
02:19:54.72 --> 02:20:02.88
Be little. Oh yeah. Well, he just he just said if someone's has to choose between joint warfare

2839
02:20:02.88 --> 02:20:06.64
and krill oil. He said if you're doing

2840
02:20:09.28 --> 02:20:15.36
if you're trying to recover something joint warfare joint warfare if you're doing maintenance

2841
02:20:16.40 --> 02:20:21.60
krill oil because the krill will maintenance other areas as well. So anyways, that's that I

2842
02:20:22.72 --> 02:20:28.16
yeah you can I and what's unfortunate for me is when people ask me which one I don't know what to tell

2843
02:20:28.16 --> 02:20:34.56
them because I've been taking you know I take them both all the time in pretty heavy doses. So anyways,

2844
02:20:34.56 --> 02:20:40.64
also mock train big time mulch train still on the mulch train by the way. Yeah, obviously because

2845
02:20:40.64 --> 02:20:46.16
this plenty of mulch to go around over here. Yeah. Well, you think you'll try to fill off the mulch

2846
02:20:46.16 --> 02:20:50.24
train ever. I don't see it happening. So Pete and I just had a conversation because we were in a rush to

2847
02:20:50.24 --> 02:20:57.20
get down here to do this and we kind of we kind of did a week do we know we we collided we collided

2848
02:20:57.20 --> 02:21:04.40
at the chocolate milk station up at the cafeteria and we did and I was like yeah I don't have

2849
02:21:04.40 --> 02:21:07.12
time to go down and make a mole right now I'm just going to drink this and he's like yeah there's

2850
02:21:07.12 --> 02:21:13.12
something about chocolate milk. I would literally a hundred percent rather have mulch peanut butter

2851
02:21:13.12 --> 02:21:17.12
or mulch chocolate mint or chocolate mint or a hundred percent rather have that than

2852
02:21:17.52 --> 02:21:21.28
did chocolate milk. And we're going to talk to them 100 percent. You can take and taste

2853
02:21:21.28 --> 02:21:28.32
the nasty sugar corn syrup when you drink regular chocolate milk. Yeah, it's like like when you get

2854
02:21:28.32 --> 02:21:31.92
used to the milk it's like a kind of drink soda. You drink soda. You drink soda. You

2855
02:21:31.92 --> 02:21:38.32
from time to time. You ever drink like Coca Cola? No, I don't drink Coca Cola ever. What do you drink?

2856
02:21:38.32 --> 02:21:46.000
You fan. Okay. So you guys want to know if you ever stop drinking soda, if you ever stop drinking

2857
02:21:46.000 --> 02:21:52.56
soda and then you go back and have one it tastes so syrupy and sweet. To me that's what

2858
02:21:52.56 --> 02:21:58.08
chocolate milk tastes like now it's got this nasty and it's not it's not it doesn't taste sweeter

2859
02:21:58.08 --> 02:22:06.000
it tastes more syrupy mulch. It's like if you drink like a coke or a phanta in your case like

2860
02:22:06.000 --> 02:22:10.72
right after training. You seem to say instead of like a water. I do get to say like I don't drink

2861
02:22:10.72 --> 02:22:17.52
a lot of soda. Okay. It all. So it has to taste my house. Did you taste it? No, there's something about

2862
02:22:17.52 --> 02:22:23.52
phanta. Okay. That which one they can't deny. Great pineapple. Great pineapple. Yeah, it's

2863
02:22:23.52 --> 02:22:29.36
not all of it. It's undesignated these. Yeah, so like I'm not even kidding once every two months.

2864
02:22:30.16 --> 02:22:35.76
My son. So we wouldn't my kids never drink soda and when my son was like six or seven years old

2865
02:22:35.76 --> 02:22:41.36
I brought him to the team when I was at trade at and we did like a monster mash which is in the

2866
02:22:41.36 --> 02:22:45.92
team's monster mash is when you set up just like obstacle course and then run and then a boat

2867
02:22:45.92 --> 02:22:50.56
carry and just set up all these crazy things and they'll just do all these weird stuff and one of

2868
02:22:50.56 --> 02:22:57.12
the stations was you had to drink a whole can of coke through a straw and then you had to like

2869
02:22:57.12 --> 02:23:01.12
do a sprint over the Burma or whatever and so my son's doing all this stuff with me and he gets

2870
02:23:01.12 --> 02:23:05.84
the coke and he's like looks at me like can I drink it and I was like brothers to the teams.

2871
02:23:05.84 --> 02:23:11.28
Get drunk. They're drinking quick and so he like drinks it down and as he's drinking it you can

2872
02:23:11.28 --> 02:23:17.04
see him like his initial face is like oh and then it just like his face just goes all like

2873
02:23:17.04 --> 02:23:21.12
and then he just looks like turns that kind of pale when you could see he was feeling it wasn't

2874
02:23:21.12 --> 02:23:25.60
like too much. So he still doesn't drink coke. Yeah man. That's a good no no no so let's

2875
02:23:25.60 --> 02:23:31.44
but I think we've got a milk movement in farming to mean what's the milk mix it well you know

2876
02:23:31.44 --> 02:23:35.04
is we've got the kids that come because my kids are in junior high and high school and they come

2877
02:23:35.04 --> 02:23:40.000
and then they bring their friends in and every time they say me they just like kind of look at

2878
02:23:40.000 --> 02:23:47.36
me and yeah for milk they're like and they'll be like that milk is so good. They're like

2879
02:23:47.36 --> 02:23:52.08
guys pretty good isn't it hanging around down underneath the bridge drinking milk. Exactly.

2880
02:23:52.08 --> 02:23:55.84
What are you guys doing today going to this circle to drink more?

2881
02:23:57.84 --> 02:24:01.52
A immersion camp 2019 we sold this one out which was kind of new.

2882
02:24:02.32 --> 02:24:07.12
There was actually one of the one of the girls here I was talking to her and she's all fired up

2883
02:24:07.12 --> 02:24:11.92
and her brother she's like my brother's so mad he couldn't come and I said oh why couldn't he come

2884
02:24:11.92 --> 02:24:17.68
she's like it's sold out. So can you imagine brother sister sister gets his own brother doesn't get to go.

2885
02:24:17.68 --> 02:24:23.84
So they did prioritize and execute soon enough. Are we gonna be able to get more people next year?

2886
02:24:24.56 --> 02:24:28.88
Yes you know the agreement we had with the contract with the camp limitless to a certain amount

2887
02:24:29.60 --> 02:24:34.96
but talking with the owner camp laurel he's like you we can expand more for you guys to make

2888
02:24:34.96 --> 02:24:40.24
that happen because they they actually want us here because it's just great for them it's great for us

2889
02:24:40.24 --> 02:24:44.24
it's it's it's not like they're taking a care of a bunch of kids let's put it that way.

2890
02:24:44.24 --> 02:24:48.88
Cool yeah no that's gonna be a lot of so look for that at origin all those things origin

2891
02:24:48.88 --> 02:24:55.28
main.com that's where you can find all that cool origin stuff and support a little something called

2892
02:24:55.92 --> 02:24:59.04
America while you're doing it get some also

2893
02:25:00.08 --> 02:25:05.12
Jocco has a store similar to jujitsu for operations camp

2894
02:25:05.92 --> 02:25:12.000
no curriculars and operations jujitsu offense for combat killing operations. All right there you go

2895
02:25:12.000 --> 02:25:16.16
you're too too offense for combat killing operations. So in that same vein

2896
02:25:17.76 --> 02:25:24.000
Jocco has a store he named it. Jocco store yeah yeah so it makes more sense not even to me and I've been

2930
02:28:50.96 --> 02:28:57.76
I agree not to I just remember I draw for you you just draw for me some kind of packaging or

2932
02:29:02.96 --> 02:29:10.80

2935
02:29:23.76 --> 02:29:30.48
him a you guys be quiet I'm over here innately understanding color theory I'm going to need some time

2936
02:29:30.48 --> 02:29:35.68
why don't you think what I walked in that grab this folder and I was like that would make a good

2937

2946
02:30:29.68 --> 02:30:36.40
I have been but I got off the working out tranks I swelbed up too much yeah so now I just drink

2947
02:30:36.40 --> 02:30:40.80
more contrages you hooked up too yeah yeah I did I did seriously you realize you can

2948
02:30:40.80 --> 02:30:44.88
switch up the workout so you don't you've been teaching me some things about that we're talking

2949
02:30:44.88 --> 02:30:53.44
the other day well yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah so we're talking about

2950
02:30:53.44 --> 02:30:58.64
on it anyway my kettlebells all pretty pretty much all my new workout stuff like this switching

2951
02:30:58.64 --> 02:31:03.92
up from bulking up all of it all on it stuff all of it a kettlebells make cast iron cast iron

2952
02:31:03.92 --> 02:31:09.68
cast iron if I'm not mistaken cast yeah yeah but I got the cool ones the primal bells and whatnot

2953
02:31:09.68 --> 02:31:14.40
that's the dope one that's a pretty cool process have you ever seen how that works yeah yeah we

2954
02:31:14.40 --> 02:31:20.56
when I was in college we myself and my friends built a foundry at the college and what you did

2955
02:31:20.56 --> 02:31:28.24
is you start to make those kettlebells you actually start with a wax it's wax and you dip the wax

2956
02:31:28.24 --> 02:31:33.12
you you make these little vents like air holes yeah air holes and then you dip the wax and

2957
02:31:33.12 --> 02:31:37.60
what's called slurry chr-chr and then you melt the wax out of the slurry and you fill it with

2958
02:31:37.60 --> 02:31:44.000
molten metal and it cools and you won't crack it molten molten metal or they say molten

2959
02:31:44.000 --> 02:31:50.16
yeah and then you end up with something badass yeah yeah yeah and they balance some it's like

2960
02:31:50.16 --> 02:31:55.44
yeah it's a pride it's pretty cool it's one thing to be like okay here's a perfectly round ball

2961
02:31:55.44 --> 02:31:58.64
you know and it's all balanced you know because you got to swing that thing around can't be

2962
02:31:58.64 --> 02:32:03.44
swinging in one way and then the other way you hurt yourself yeah so they you know they make

2963
02:32:03.44 --> 02:32:08.16
the artistic ones but they're still balanced that's deep anyway no I get it no we're just together

2964
02:32:08.16 --> 02:32:13.68
now yeah plus you're artistic so you need to artistic kettlebells you're right absolutely right

2965
02:32:13.68 --> 02:32:18.32
well they have other cool stuff on there switch up your workout if you want to bulk up while

2966
02:32:18.32 --> 02:32:25.92
you're moking up like Pete Roberts you want to trim down and slim down just anyway you know what

02:33:07.60 --> 02:33:11.52
pay a thousand pounds as soon as you have one step yeah you so you could probably move one of those

2974
02:33:11.52 --> 02:33:18.24
looms yeah yeah yeah we'll drink some white tea and get that done books way the warrior kid

2975
02:33:18.96 --> 02:33:28.08
marks mission and marks mission I've signed at this camp a ton of both books and it's so awesome

2976
02:33:28.08 --> 02:33:34.64
to have parents say what they say about their kids after reading those books yeah it's the most

2977
02:33:34.64 --> 02:33:40.08
impactful thing I've ever heard about for children that's a bold statement as far as kids

2978
02:33:40.08 --> 02:33:48.64
behave your changing in a positive direction give it a try way the warrior kid that's book one

2979
02:33:48.64 --> 02:33:54.64
marks mission book two get it for some kids that you know that was pretty cool I've signed a lot of

2980
02:33:54.64 --> 02:33:58.72
books here where they're like oh you know I just signed one today hey the kids parents are split

2981
02:33:58.72 --> 02:34:03.28
knob he's leaving he's you know he's ten years old it what you can you sign this for him like

2982
02:34:03.28 --> 02:34:08.72
yeah I'll sign this thing for him all day long because what's that kid going through get the kid

2983
02:34:08.72 --> 02:34:13.68
a book it's going to give them directions going to show them the path and it's a it's a positive path

2984
02:34:13.68 --> 02:34:19.92
it's a path that everybody would want their kids to be on and would want any kid to be on I don't

2985
02:34:19.92 --> 02:34:25.60
care who you are you're going to want your kids on this path um extreme ownership we talked about

2986
02:34:25.60 --> 02:34:31.28
it a bunch today you know Pete Pete talked about how you know you've used it I think you gave

2987
02:34:31.28 --> 02:34:37.12
great examples and you've also seen dichotomy leadership dichotomy leadership available for

2988
02:34:37.12 --> 02:34:45.12
your to right now if you want first of this do you know I was thinking about like extreme ownership

2989
02:34:45.12 --> 02:34:49.36
the book and then that caromy leadership the book you know what that's like it's like you're

2990
02:34:49.36 --> 02:34:55.28
watching movie major league you're watching movie no I think I have for a while you're seeing Wesley

2991
02:34:55.28 --> 02:35:00.72
Snipes they go on you know Cleveland Indians anyway yes I have so this is what have been Charlie

2992
02:35:00.72 --> 02:35:05.92
Sheenie comes out of jail whatever it's like a rag tag group of guys they put together pro team baseball

2993
02:35:05.92 --> 02:35:14.40
Cleveland Indians Charlie Sheen comes in he has the fastest fastball ever but it's control like he

2994
02:35:14.40 --> 02:35:20.08
you know he's ripping him in the shoulders and yeah you know it turns out he just needs glasses whatever

2995
02:35:20.08 --> 02:35:27.84
but so yeah all this speed and power power but his control hasn't come around that's what extreme

2996
02:35:27.84 --> 02:35:32.56
ownership is but you get the dichotomy leadership that's the control so I'm saying so you get

2997
02:35:32.56 --> 02:35:37.52
X humanish it be got the power now but you need the control too that's the dichotomy leadership tune it in

2998
02:35:37.52 --> 02:35:42.96
seems saying that we have the most sensible thing I've heard it's said with reference to a movie

2999
02:35:42.96 --> 02:35:49.28
there's a good metaphor you really I just I don't and here's a thing

3000
02:35:50.64 --> 02:35:54.24
I'm not gonna say you can't own one without the other what I'm gonna say is this

3001
02:35:54.24 --> 02:36:03.20
if you don't own one without the other you're doing yourself at the service because

3002
02:36:04.24 --> 02:36:08.32
there are two tools that work together you know I mean you need the both tools

3003
02:36:10.000 --> 02:36:16.16
or you're not gonna fully you know become who you want to become as a leader so get the two tools

3004
02:36:16.16 --> 02:36:22.72
that's it it's easy agree plus you want to control that fastball yeah yeah man power is good

3005
02:36:22.72 --> 02:36:30.08
but the power is good control a speaking of leadership I got a leadership consulting company

3006
02:36:30.08 --> 02:36:35.52
it's called echelon front we solve problems through leadership that's what we do we do it all day

3007

3011
02:37:01.84 --> 02:37:06.48
if you want to come register to extremownership dot com you've been to the master yeah

3012
02:37:06.48 --> 02:37:15.92
sum it up nominal sum it up uh open eyes and open ears and I took my team to the master

3013
02:37:17.92 --> 02:37:26.72
and it blew my expectations first of all because I needed them to get on the same path I was on

3014
02:37:27.44 --> 02:37:33.12
and we used as an excuse to display what we were doing but we so we went there for one reason and we

3015
02:37:33.12 --> 02:37:39.20
left with a completely for a different completely different reason and my father and la joe came also

3016
02:37:39.20 --> 02:37:46.16
and he took those those skills he's he's the he's the town road commissioner he took those skills he

3017
02:37:46.16 --> 02:37:51.28
learned and he's been dealing with the problems for 20 years and those problems he's been dealing

3018
02:37:51.28 --> 02:37:58.96
with for 20 years was him and he solved those problems and he's a different person hey yeah that's awesome

3019
02:37:58.96 --> 02:38:04.80
that's a great a lot of people do that a lot of people come to the master with their teams

3020
02:38:04.80 --> 02:38:11.12
they get everyone aligned in one shot and it's solid and then once you leave you're not on your

3021
02:38:11.12 --> 02:38:14.80
own struggling to keep that mindset you got other people back and you up and reinforcing you

thanks for your sacrifices to keep us safe and everyone else out there you know someone at the

3043
02:40:52.40 --> 02:41:00.40
immersion camp said that jiu jitsu could seem frustrating because you try things and they just don't

3044
02:41:00.40 --> 02:41:05.68
work and you practice and you drill and you try them again and things don't work and it said

3045
02:41:05.68 --> 02:41:12.80
to person just said that jiu jitsu can seem frustrating and I said jiu jitsu just doesn't seem

3046
02:41:12.80 --> 02:41:22.80
frustrating it is frustrating it is frustrating it's a grind it's hard it's overwhelming it's

3047
02:41:22.80 --> 02:41:32.56
infuriating it's irritating and it can also be very disappointing and in all those ways jiu jitsu is just

3048
02:41:32.56 --> 02:41:42.72
like life life is going to be hard it's going to be frustrating it's going to be disappointing it's

3049
02:41:42.72 --> 02:41:54.80
going to be overwhelming but like those settlers in New England you keep at it and you keep working

3050
02:41:54.80 --> 02:41:59.84
and you keep driving and pushing and grinding and then you get a little something you see a little

3051
02:41:59.84 --> 02:42:07.04
bit of light you make a little bit of progress and then you dig in and you do it again

3052
02:42:10.08 --> 02:42:16.88
and jiu jitsu is an easy and neither is life and that is what makes them both so worth doing

3053
02:42:16.88 --> 02:42:29.68
with everything you've got so get out of bed shut off the TV and pose your will on the world

3054
02:42:29.68 --> 02:42:37.92
and when you get be down by the world get back up again and get after it

3055
02:42:37.92 --> 02:42:53.84
and until next time this is Peter Roberts and echo and jockel out
