00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.64 This is Jockel podcast number 298 with echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink, good evening echo.
00:00:05.64 --> 00:00:07.04 Good evening.
00:00:07.04 --> 00:00:12.92 Within weeks of their arrival, the seals of debt, golf, were shaking off their initial
00:00:12.92 --> 00:00:16.52 jitters and even displaying some measure of proficiency.
00:00:16.52 --> 00:00:20.20 Signs of this were apparent in every aspect of their operations.
00:00:20.20 --> 00:00:26.76 On ambush, no one clear to throw coughed, spit, sneezed, or even sniffled.
00:00:26.76 --> 00:00:32.68 From insert, an extract, the men stepped heel to toe to reduce the sucking explosion of mud
00:00:32.68 --> 00:00:37.28 walking and above all avoided the footprints of the man in front to keep from sinking
00:00:37.28 --> 00:00:39.60 even deeper.
00:00:39.60 --> 00:00:44.56 To improve their infield support, the seals befriended the pilots and crews of the Navy's
00:00:44.56 --> 00:00:51.96 helicopter squadron at Naabe and overhauled the seals denuded landing craft into an
00:00:51.96 --> 00:00:54.08 up-armored ironclad.
00:00:54.08 --> 00:00:59.28 Next heavy machine guns mounted to the gun will gonnels a 60mm mortar bolt to the rust
00:00:59.28 --> 00:01:04.60 to deck plate and a bunker-busting, recorulus rifle, pinned to the top of the sandbag pilot
00:01:04.60 --> 00:01:05.60 house.
00:01:05.60 --> 00:01:12.80 It was so much armament that the men quickly recommissioned the LCM, the mighty moe.
00:01:12.80 --> 00:01:17.76 To it they added a canmene to block the sun and rain, a two burner stove for meals, then
00:01:17.76 --> 00:01:20.64 draped hammocks between everything that didn't pivot or fire.
00:01:20.64 --> 00:01:25.04 It was essentially turned into a houseboat littered with empty hot sauce, bottles, coffee
00:01:25.04 --> 00:01:30.36 cups, clothes, lines, all aids to reduce the number of trips back to Naabe and increase
00:01:30.36 --> 00:01:33.76 the amount of time they could spend in a mission area.
00:01:33.76 --> 00:01:37.92 To improve the quality of their encounters with the enemy, they experimented with a variety
00:01:37.92 --> 00:01:41.48 of tactics, false insertions that made the vehicle ang thank the seals that landed
00:01:41.48 --> 00:01:45.48 where they had false extractions that made the vehicle ang thank the seals of the left
00:01:45.48 --> 00:01:50.000 and probably most important squad sized missions that have the seals punch.
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.88 But correspondingly increase their stealth and the amount of swamp land they could cover
00:01:54.88 --> 00:01:59.04 thus doubling their chances of via-con contact.
00:01:59.04 --> 00:02:04.88 No small challenge in an area as empty of the enemy as the wrong sap.
00:02:04.88 --> 00:02:06.80 And what did these innovations yield?
00:02:06.80 --> 00:02:11.32 A handful of capture documents and North Vietnamese currency, some fresh water wells, some
00:02:11.32 --> 00:02:17.04 rice caches, one so monstrous that it merited an air strike.
00:02:17.04 --> 00:02:21.60 Then finally after more than a month of frustrations, debt golf landed a jackpot ambush
00:02:21.60 --> 00:02:26.08 of two sand pans that killed seven suspected via Congrillas.
00:02:26.08 --> 00:02:31.44 The seals reaction was the same as anyone who has just caught a hot streak.
00:02:31.44 --> 00:02:37.04 A little more than a week after the first coup, one squad pursued a tip from the crew of
00:02:37.04 --> 00:02:41.80 a hovering navy gunship that had spotted several camouflage sand pans not far from mighty
00:02:41.80 --> 00:02:48.04 mows anchorage despite having already blown their cover in that area from several days worth
00:02:48.04 --> 00:02:51.72 of patrolling the squad leader in full daylight.
00:02:51.72 --> 00:02:58.04 The squad landed in full daylight and fell in behind point man Billy Macon, a keen I-28
00:02:58.04 --> 00:03:07.36 year old Texan, the father of a daughter and a five week old boy he had never seen.
00:03:07.36 --> 00:03:13.44 Being alone into the middle of the sun drenched clearing and spotting a veat Cong bunker
00:03:13.44 --> 00:03:18.60 making managed a single burst for the Zem 16 before he was cut down by an eruption of
00:03:18.60 --> 00:03:22.16 machine gun fire that left him stranded.
00:03:22.16 --> 00:03:26.32 Hugging the ground to get under the rush of snapping bullets and splintering branches,
00:03:26.32 --> 00:03:31.32 the seals fell back on their training and clawed themselves into a rough firing line,
00:03:31.32 --> 00:03:35.04 but one that was not nearly stiff enough to break the wall of lead that blocked their
00:03:35.04 --> 00:03:39.08 way to the fallen comrade.
00:03:39.08 --> 00:03:46.48 To Tom Truxel engaged in the untested platoon commanders perennial two front war, the enemy
00:03:46.48 --> 00:03:51.68 and his own doubts, it seemed that the only recourse might be to pull back to the river
00:03:51.68 --> 00:03:53.28 and to the mighty mows guns.
00:03:53.28 --> 00:03:59.48 That is, until one of his men fired a 40 millimeter grenade into the bunker's mouth.
00:03:59.48 --> 00:04:04.18 The shock forced a momentary flinch in the enemy's ambush, just long enough for the heavy
00:04:04.18 --> 00:04:10.06 weight, mows scone to bowl a mad dash for making who is carried to safety just in time
00:04:10.06 --> 00:04:14.82 to whisper a final message to his wife while the corpsmen ransacked his tiger stripes
00:04:14.82 --> 00:04:20.02 to find his wounders.
00:04:20.02 --> 00:04:24.72 Considering that makeens death was considering that makeens death and combat was not
00:04:24.72 --> 00:04:31.82 simply the first for the seal teams, but that it was also nearly a 2% man power loss for
00:04:31.82 --> 00:04:38.58 seal team one, no one would have faulted to wires if he had forced a pause to assess the
00:04:38.58 --> 00:04:42.38 operation that had led to the tragedy.
00:04:42.38 --> 00:04:44.38 He didn't.
00:04:44.38 --> 00:04:48.78 The reason was no more complicated than the same one taught to anyone who has ever looked
00:04:48.78 --> 00:04:52.74 up to see the belly of the horse that just bucked them off.
00:04:52.74 --> 00:04:59.10 Wires ordered his men back to back into their saddles and back into the rung sat.
00:04:59.10 --> 00:05:04.26 His perseverance would have payoffs within a month the seals of death go for expanding
00:05:04.26 --> 00:05:09.38 their operational repertoire from planned patrol and ambush to unplanned quick reaction
00:05:09.38 --> 00:05:13.62 counter attacks along the rung sat's choke points.
00:05:13.62 --> 00:05:18.66 In theory it was an operational expansion that finally fulfilled the bucklue reports
00:05:18.66 --> 00:05:22.54 recommendation for riverbank raiders.
00:05:22.54 --> 00:05:29.34 In practice it was a resurrection of the navies grapple swinging boarding parties.
00:05:29.34 --> 00:05:34.86 In counters now included the inland pursuit and cornering of black pajama wearing attackers
00:05:34.86 --> 00:05:40.30 firefights that varied from a few sharp rifle exchanges to 15 minute skirmishes.
00:05:40.30 --> 00:05:45.86 One of these against an enemy packed haystack that did not stop firing until the seals
00:05:45.86 --> 00:05:50.82 launched 48 grenades into it.
00:05:50.82 --> 00:05:56.82 And for along the operational impact of death golfs aggressiveness was considered so substantial
00:05:56.82 --> 00:06:01.86 that Admiral Ward approved its increase from two platoons to three.
00:06:01.86 --> 00:06:07.14 All but a guarantee of a corresponding increase in impact.
00:06:07.14 --> 00:06:12.42 While this blossomed so too did the seals confidence, best evidenced by their swagger
00:06:12.42 --> 00:06:14.18 around knobbe.
00:06:14.18 --> 00:06:19.26 But also by a wooden sign above the entrance to their tent, scrawled.
00:06:19.26 --> 00:06:24.82 Yay though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil because
00:06:24.82 --> 00:06:28.50 I'm the meanest bastard in the valley.
00:06:28.50 --> 00:06:34.34 Though the helmets and flack jackets of the uncountable gIs would soon boast the same
00:06:34.34 --> 00:06:35.62 thing.
00:06:35.62 --> 00:06:43.26 By mid autumn 1966 the seals claimed to meanest in the valley was undisputed.
00:06:43.26 --> 00:06:52.86 And the wrong sat no other unit was as lethal.
00:06:52.86 --> 00:07:00.86 And that right there is an excerpt from a book and the book is called by the water beneath
00:07:00.86 --> 00:07:05.30 the walls, the rise of the navy seals.
00:07:05.30 --> 00:07:09.70 And it's written by a guy Benjamin Milligan.
00:07:09.70 --> 00:07:18.94 This book is a comprehensive history book about the origin of the seal teams.
00:07:18.94 --> 00:07:26.74 Now that passage hit me because I trained throughout my entire career at a place called
00:07:26.74 --> 00:07:32.18 Camp Billy Maken out in the Imperial Valley of Southern California.
00:07:32.18 --> 00:07:34.54 And I knew the story of Billy Maken.
00:07:34.54 --> 00:07:38.78 He was awarded the Silver Star and they have that citation out there at the Desert Training
00:07:38.78 --> 00:07:39.78 Compound.
00:07:39.78 --> 00:07:46.74 They also have pictures of his platoon and BTF Tony, Tony of Friday night.
00:07:46.74 --> 00:07:51.98 We used to inspect those pictures and we used to look at BM1 Mascone.
00:07:51.98 --> 00:07:53.86 And he was listed in that platoon picture.
00:07:53.86 --> 00:07:55.50 We used to talk about him.
00:07:55.50 --> 00:07:59.66 And he was this massive guy we stood out in the picture and we used to think what would
00:07:59.66 --> 00:08:05.14 BM1 Mascone do right now in this situation.
00:08:05.14 --> 00:08:09.90 But that really is about all the information we had about Billy Maken and his platoon
00:08:09.90 --> 00:08:12.34 and what they didn't Vietnam.
00:08:12.34 --> 00:08:17.06 Some word of mouth stories that we would hear from some of the older Vietnam guys,
00:08:17.06 --> 00:08:19.46 but that's about it.
00:08:19.46 --> 00:08:26.40 But this book spells it out so much more and the book details the entire history of the
00:08:26.40 --> 00:08:32.90 seal teams from the scouts and raiders to the naval combat demolition units to the underwater
00:08:32.90 --> 00:08:40.74 demolition teams up to what we now know and where I served my adult life in the seal
00:08:40.74 --> 00:08:41.74 teams.
00:08:41.74 --> 00:08:49.14 Now I normally don't cover history books on the podcast because I prefer to read first
00:08:49.14 --> 00:08:51.66 person accounts of people that were actually there.
00:08:51.66 --> 00:08:58.18 People that understand what it's like to live through and experience things, not just
00:08:58.18 --> 00:09:08.34 the research it, well this book is an exception because the author Ben Milligan was a seal,
00:09:08.34 --> 00:09:12.94 which adds a level of understanding and connection that comes across on every page of this
00:09:12.94 --> 00:09:13.94 book.
00:09:13.94 --> 00:09:21.58 It is also so thorough and extensive of history of the seals that it leaves no stone unturned
00:09:21.58 --> 00:09:30.34 and connects really to the soul of the modern day seal, connects us with our frogmen,
00:09:30.34 --> 00:09:38.98 forefathers and I think this book should be required reading for all seals or anyone
00:09:38.98 --> 00:09:40.54 even remotely interested in the seal.
00:09:40.54 --> 00:09:47.74 So they understand where we came from and the sacrifices that were made to get us where
00:09:47.74 --> 00:09:52.14 we are today and it just so happens that we have the honor of the author Ben Milligan
00:09:52.14 --> 00:09:58.46 here tonight to talk to us about his time in the teams and his amazing account of the
00:09:58.46 --> 00:10:01.82 history of the frogmen.
00:10:01.82 --> 00:10:03.66 Ben, thanks for joining us.
00:10:03.66 --> 00:10:07.18 Thanks, Jacob.
00:10:07.18 --> 00:10:11.02 Let's get a little start off by getting a little background on you and where you came from
00:10:11.02 --> 00:10:13.38 before we get into the background and where the seals came from.
00:10:13.38 --> 00:10:15.82 Let's figure out about where Ben Milligan came from.
00:10:15.82 --> 00:10:22.94 So where did you grow up in the inapolis northeastern side and what was the situation
00:10:22.94 --> 00:10:25.18 you were born to mom and dad do?
00:10:25.18 --> 00:10:32.90 My dad was in here in the northern throat surgeon, worked in a small town in Indiana
00:10:32.90 --> 00:10:33.90 called Anderson.
00:10:33.90 --> 00:10:37.90 It was a small GM town.
00:10:37.90 --> 00:10:40.34 I think he was the only.
00:10:40.34 --> 00:10:49.90 He was him and one other auntie in town so he was kind of like minor celebrity status.
00:10:49.90 --> 00:10:53.94 It wasn't a restaurant that we would go to in town or somebody that could come up and say
00:10:53.94 --> 00:10:56.06 hey, doc, thanks for such and such.
00:10:56.06 --> 00:10:59.26 Hey, doc, I got a sore nose for help man.
00:10:59.26 --> 00:11:00.26 Yeah.
00:11:00.26 --> 00:11:04.98 At one point I think every single member of my family except for my younger brother worked
00:11:04.98 --> 00:11:09.70 in my dad's office so we kind of grew up in the medical field.
00:11:09.70 --> 00:11:11.70 Welcome to Welcom to Doc Milligan.
00:11:11.70 --> 00:11:13.30 Can you have a seat over there?
00:11:13.30 --> 00:11:14.30 Would you like a candy?
00:11:14.30 --> 00:11:15.30 That kind of thing?
00:11:15.30 --> 00:11:19.86 Yeah, I kind of was probably the worst of my dad's employees but he was kind of
00:11:19.86 --> 00:11:24.18 enough to keep me on the worst example of Nepotism.
00:11:24.18 --> 00:11:25.18 What about your mom?
00:11:25.18 --> 00:11:26.18 Did she work with you?
00:11:26.18 --> 00:11:27.18 How's my housewife?
00:11:27.18 --> 00:11:28.18 Yeah, housewife.
00:11:28.18 --> 00:11:29.18 She looked after us.
00:11:29.18 --> 00:11:30.18 She looked after us.
00:11:30.18 --> 00:11:32.18 She was three boys and one girl.
00:11:32.18 --> 00:11:33.18 So fair amount.
00:11:33.18 --> 00:11:34.18 What number were you?
00:11:34.18 --> 00:11:35.18 I was a male.
00:11:35.18 --> 00:11:37.78 So I have an older brother younger brother and then baby sister.
00:11:37.78 --> 00:11:40.98 So you're number two out of four.
00:11:40.98 --> 00:11:44.70 What about what sports were you playing growing up?
00:11:44.70 --> 00:11:48.30 I played soccer badly.
00:11:48.30 --> 00:11:53.70 I think they kept me on the team because the school that I went to was so small.
00:11:53.70 --> 00:11:56.30 They really didn't know what he else.
00:11:56.30 --> 00:12:00.34 Yeah, I didn't get to the seal teams through any athletic ability.
00:12:00.34 --> 00:12:02.30 I was a really good trier.
00:12:02.30 --> 00:12:08.26 So after the end of every soccer season when they passed out of awards, they would always
00:12:08.26 --> 00:12:10.22 give me like the Mr. Hustle.
00:12:10.22 --> 00:12:13.58 Most improved with some other.
00:12:13.58 --> 00:12:17.82 Just sort of underhandleward.
00:12:17.82 --> 00:12:20.14 What was the anything else going on in high school?
00:12:20.14 --> 00:12:21.58 What kind of music did you like?
00:12:21.58 --> 00:12:22.58 Yeah, I did.
00:12:22.58 --> 00:12:26.82 I was a decent a track but as far as music.
00:12:26.82 --> 00:12:28.74 That's typical stuff.
00:12:28.74 --> 00:12:30.74 Nothing crazy.
00:12:30.74 --> 00:12:31.74 Nothing crazy.
00:12:31.74 --> 00:12:32.74 Nothing hip.
00:12:32.74 --> 00:12:37.74 You're looking at the the lamest guy that ever got through.
00:12:37.74 --> 00:12:38.74 Yeah.
00:12:38.74 --> 00:12:41.42 When you said you ran track or you ran cross country, you're both.
00:12:41.42 --> 00:12:42.58 I kind of did a little both.
00:12:42.58 --> 00:12:45.18 I did cross country.
00:12:45.18 --> 00:12:46.18 My freshman year.
00:12:46.18 --> 00:12:48.42 What's the longest race you run in cross country and high school?
00:12:48.42 --> 00:12:50.22 It's like three miles or something.
00:12:50.22 --> 00:12:52.22 Yeah, it's nothing overwhelming.
00:12:52.22 --> 00:12:53.62 I was good at it.
00:12:53.62 --> 00:12:56.74 I probably could have done that.
00:12:56.74 --> 00:13:00.22 But after my freshman year, you run a mile when you're in high school.
00:13:00.22 --> 00:13:05.74 I think the fastest I did was something like 450, 448, something like that.
00:13:05.74 --> 00:13:11.74 But the only reason I think that was as good as I was ever going to get.
00:13:11.74 --> 00:13:19.06 When I when I raced after every race, it was, I mean, I dry heaving everything else.
00:13:19.06 --> 00:13:22.38 I couldn't, I would get so nervous before the race that I couldn't eat.
00:13:22.38 --> 00:13:24.86 I wouldn't sleep the night before as miserable.
00:13:24.86 --> 00:13:26.46 What were you nervous about?
00:13:26.46 --> 00:13:27.46 I was just brutal.
00:13:27.46 --> 00:13:29.98 Pain because I didn't have the natural talent to do this.
00:13:29.98 --> 00:13:31.98 So I just got it out.
00:13:31.98 --> 00:13:34.98 So you were nervous about the suffering you were going to experience.
00:13:34.98 --> 00:13:36.98 Yeah.
00:13:36.98 --> 00:13:38.98 What's made you suffer even more?
00:13:38.98 --> 00:13:39.98 Jack O'Wishos, tougher.
00:13:39.98 --> 00:13:42.98 I was just...
00:13:42.98 --> 00:13:48.50 And so what, what did you have any inkling about going in the military when you were
00:13:48.50 --> 00:13:49.50 in high school?
00:13:49.50 --> 00:13:53.30 Yeah, I knew that that was, I was going to do that.
00:13:53.30 --> 00:13:57.18 I think I announced to my parents that I wanted to be a CO when I was 12.
00:13:57.18 --> 00:13:58.98 They didn't know what a CO was.
00:13:58.98 --> 00:14:00.98 How did you know what a CO was?
00:14:00.98 --> 00:14:03.98 I've heard my older brothers friends talking about it.
00:14:03.98 --> 00:14:06.98 And prior to that, my grandpa had been a Marine in World War II.
00:14:06.98 --> 00:14:10.98 So growing up until I was about 12, I'd wanted to be a Marine.
00:14:10.98 --> 00:14:13.98 Then I found out what Navy SEALs were.
00:14:13.98 --> 00:14:18.98 And then I also sort of found out right at the same time that after the battle of
00:14:18.98 --> 00:14:20.98 O'Wishos and my grandpa had volunteered.
00:14:20.98 --> 00:14:24.98 He was one of the few guys that could swim and they were so desperate for a frogman.
00:14:24.98 --> 00:14:27.98 After O'Wishos and I went for the invasion of Japan that they had ransacked
00:14:27.98 --> 00:14:31.98 the ranks just looking for anybody that could swim and he had volunteered for the UDT.
00:14:31.98 --> 00:14:36.98 So he was one of the handful of non-navy guys that actually joined.
00:14:36.98 --> 00:14:41.98 So he didn't do any operations as a frogman, but he was attached to a UDT.
00:14:41.98 --> 00:14:44.98 So you found that out, but found that out.
00:14:44.98 --> 00:14:48.98 And I was like, well, you know, impressionable age.
00:14:48.98 --> 00:14:51.98 And I'm going to do that.
00:14:51.98 --> 00:14:54.98 So what was your comfort level in the water?
00:14:54.98 --> 00:14:59.98 I was like, hi, comfort level. He was, my grandpa was,
00:14:59.98 --> 00:15:03.98 I think we were at the pool every weekend.
00:15:03.98 --> 00:15:09.98 So when it was a big part of our growing up and then so very comfortable.
00:15:09.98 --> 00:15:11.98 But never raced in the water.
00:15:11.98 --> 00:15:13.98 Never swam competitively.
00:15:13.98 --> 00:15:16.98 Like I said before, the school that I went to was so small.
00:15:16.98 --> 00:15:18.98 I think I had 54 kids at my graduating class.
00:15:18.98 --> 00:15:21.98 I mean, I played soccer because there was no football team.
00:15:21.98 --> 00:15:25.98 I ran track. We didn't have a wrestling team or anything like that.
00:15:25.98 --> 00:15:29.98 I had those. I probably would have done them, but I did what I could.
00:15:29.98 --> 00:15:37.98 When I got to Buds, I, you know, realized after a whole week that I was easily the slowest swimmer that had made it through.
00:15:37.98 --> 00:15:40.98 I just didn't know what the hell I was doing.
00:15:40.98 --> 00:15:43.98 So when did you go to college after the school?
00:15:43.98 --> 00:15:44.98 And where did you go to college?
00:15:44.98 --> 00:15:47.98 Purdue study history.
00:15:47.98 --> 00:15:49.98 Is that what you knew you wanted to do?
00:15:49.98 --> 00:15:52.98 Did you always have like an affinity for history?
00:15:52.98 --> 00:15:53.98 Always. Yeah.
00:15:53.98 --> 00:15:57.98 Starting, you know, my dad was always reading to us.
00:15:57.98 --> 00:15:59.98 My grandpa was always reading to us.
00:15:59.98 --> 00:16:04.98 We would, as a family, we would take trips and often we were hitting a battlefield along the way.
00:16:04.98 --> 00:16:07.98 When I hit junior high though, right at that, you know,
00:16:07.98 --> 00:16:13.98 consequential point in my life. My grandpa, every, every fall, every fall break.
00:16:13.98 --> 00:16:17.98 He started taking me to a different, you know, the, the long weekend.
00:16:17.98 --> 00:16:22.98 He would take me to a different civil war battlefield or some other, you know, a revolutionary war battlefield.
00:16:22.98 --> 00:16:27.98 So it just kind of got, uh, I just got addicted.
00:16:27.98 --> 00:16:30.98 So it was just, uh, I got caught isn't enthusiasm, I guess.
00:16:30.98 --> 00:16:36.98 So when you were going to college, were you actually learning and putting,
00:16:36.98 --> 00:16:39.98 see, when I went to college, I was just doing what I was told to do.
00:16:39.98 --> 00:16:42.98 I mean, I went, I was already in the Navy when I went to college,
00:16:42.98 --> 00:16:46.98 but I was just doing whatever I needed to do to get good grades.
00:16:46.98 --> 00:16:48.98 I wasn't like, oh, this is so interesting.
00:16:48.98 --> 00:16:50.98 I don't think I said that one single time.
00:16:50.98 --> 00:16:52.98 I would just like, do I need to memorize this?
00:16:52.98 --> 00:16:54.98 Cool, give it to me. That was my attitude.
00:16:54.98 --> 00:16:56.98 But it seems like you might have had a different attitude.
00:16:56.98 --> 00:17:00.98 No, no, I, if you, uh, at least were trying to get good grades,
00:17:00.98 --> 00:17:02.98 you're better than me because I didn't care about that.
00:17:02.98 --> 00:17:05.98 So I mean, I, you're just trying to pass.
00:17:05.98 --> 00:17:15.98 Well, my, so I tried to enlist, uh, in, in the Navy, my senior year of, uh,
00:17:15.98 --> 00:17:19.98 high school, I hadn't shown up after a soccer practice back home.
00:17:19.98 --> 00:17:23.98 And I had gone directly from, uh, practice to the recruiters office.
00:17:23.98 --> 00:17:26.98 And I was getting ready to sign on the dotted line because I didn't want to go to college.
00:17:26.98 --> 00:17:28.98 I wanted to go right into the Navy.
00:17:28.98 --> 00:17:33.98 And, uh, uh, the recruiter to his credit, he, um, uh,
00:17:33.98 --> 00:17:35.98 stops me before I sign.
00:17:35.98 --> 00:17:39.98 And he, you know, points, you know, obviously behind me and he goes,
00:17:39.98 --> 00:17:42.98 do you know that woman, I turn around.
00:17:42.98 --> 00:17:44.98 My mom has both hands on the window and she saw it.
00:17:44.98 --> 00:17:46.98 I took a pause.
00:17:46.98 --> 00:17:48.98 Went out in the parking lot.
00:17:48.98 --> 00:17:53.98 My mom and I had a conversation, uh, and she begged me not to join the military.
00:17:53.98 --> 00:17:56.98 Nobody joined the military and our family since, you know, World War II.
00:17:56.98 --> 00:18:00.98 So when I got out there, I said I would go to one year of college.
00:18:00.98 --> 00:18:03.98 Uh, and after, if I did that one year of college, I would have their blessing.
00:18:03.98 --> 00:18:07.98 So when I'd signed up for classes my first year, I had no, I, I, I had no plan.
00:18:07.98 --> 00:18:09.98 I just signed up for every class.
00:18:09.98 --> 00:18:13.98 I just, I just, I just, I just, I just, I just, I just, I just, I just,
00:18:13.98 --> 00:18:14.98 signed up for every class.
00:18:14.98 --> 00:18:15.98 It looked interesting.
00:18:15.98 --> 00:18:16.98 I signed up for the history of World War II.
00:18:16.98 --> 00:18:23.98 I signed up for, uh, I, I mean, I, I, I just, I had no, I just signed up for all these
00:18:23.98 --> 00:18:24.98 history classes.
00:18:24.98 --> 00:18:25.98 And I went to the first one.
00:18:25.98 --> 00:18:26.98 I was hooked.
00:18:26.98 --> 00:18:28.98 And so you did kind of like your classes.
00:18:28.98 --> 00:18:29.98 I liked my history classes.
00:18:29.98 --> 00:18:32.98 So there's only, uh, classes that I paid in the attention to, but I loved them.
00:18:32.98 --> 00:18:36.98 And I, I had, I had great, uh, professors, the history and political science classes.
00:18:36.98 --> 00:18:41.98 So there, there's really no military history classes or courses or, uh,
00:18:41.98 --> 00:18:42.98 left in the country.
00:18:42.98 --> 00:18:45.98 There's only a couple of institutions that do military history.
00:18:45.98 --> 00:18:51.98 Um, so they've, they've taken a lot of that military, uh, history curriculum and it kind of,
00:18:51.98 --> 00:18:55.98 uh, farmed it out to different disciplines, political science being one of them.
00:18:55.98 --> 00:18:59.98 Um, and so I would, you know, just look for all these interesting classes, all the stuff that,
00:18:59.98 --> 00:19:01.98 you know, I was interested in.
00:19:01.98 --> 00:19:06.98 Um, I managed to carve out a degree and when I graduated and, you know, two
00:19:06.98 --> 00:19:10.98 thousand, I, I don't, somehow I managed to graduate in four years.
00:19:10.98 --> 00:19:14.98 Um, then I, I tried to go to OCS.
00:19:14.98 --> 00:19:16.98 I had no idea what I was doing.
00:19:16.98 --> 00:19:17.98 I never met another seal.
00:19:17.98 --> 00:19:23.98 My application to go to OCS and then get, uh, a bud's contract afterwards was ridiculous.
00:19:23.98 --> 00:19:30.98 I mean, they asked, you know, on the application, now I know, you know, you need, like, an admiral or somebody to write a letter, recommendation.
00:19:30.98 --> 00:19:31.98 My buddy Fred.
00:19:31.98 --> 00:19:34.98 I had my high school soccer coach.
00:19:34.98 --> 00:19:37.98 My application was put back.
00:19:37.98 --> 00:19:40.98 Especially, that was in 2000.
00:19:40.98 --> 00:19:41.98 Yeah. Oh, yeah.
00:19:41.98 --> 00:19:45.98 In 2000, the competition for the officer bill it's is insane.
00:19:45.98 --> 00:19:46.98 Insane.
00:19:46.98 --> 00:19:47.98 Insane.
00:19:47.98 --> 00:19:48.98 So I just didn't listen.
00:19:48.98 --> 00:19:51.98 And the freaking soccer coach just did cut it.
00:19:51.98 --> 00:19:53.98 Such a bummer.
00:19:53.98 --> 00:19:56.98 It was a very nice letter.
00:19:56.98 --> 00:20:00.98 So, so then you just said, cool, I'm the most thing.
00:20:00.98 --> 00:20:01.98 Yeah.
00:20:01.98 --> 00:20:04.98 And my parents did you know, did you mom break down the game?
00:20:04.98 --> 00:20:07.98 You know, my parents were on a trip when this happened.
00:20:07.98 --> 00:20:09.98 Do you want to see God?
00:20:09.98 --> 00:20:09.98 Yeah.
00:20:09.98 --> 00:20:11.98 My parents were gone.
00:20:11.98 --> 00:20:14.98 Um, they knew how important this was to me.
00:20:14.98 --> 00:20:16.98 They knew that I really didn't have a plan afterwards.
00:20:16.98 --> 00:20:21.98 It's not like I'd, you know, been in some sort of apprenticeship to, you know, go to law school or anything like that.
00:20:21.98 --> 00:20:23.98 I wasn't prepared for anything.
00:20:23.98 --> 00:20:28.98 So, uh, when that, when I hit that roadblock, I called my parents.
00:20:28.98 --> 00:20:32.98 They were, you know, like I said, they weren't there talking my dad.
00:20:32.98 --> 00:20:37.98 And my dad, to his credit, just said this is something you have to do.
00:20:37.98 --> 00:20:41.98 And so I went over and went to the, uh,
00:20:41.98 --> 00:20:44.98 and listed recruiter and I signed that day two weeks.
00:20:44.98 --> 00:20:45.98 Two weeks later, I was gone.
00:20:45.98 --> 00:20:46.98 That's freaking legit.
00:20:46.98 --> 00:20:48.98 And what year was that?
00:20:48.98 --> 00:20:49.98 2000.
00:20:49.98 --> 00:20:57.98 So I signed up and, uh, uh, early August of 2000, I was gone by the end of the month.
00:20:57.98 --> 00:20:59.98 That was 2000.
00:20:59.98 --> 00:21:00.98 Right.
00:21:00.98 --> 00:21:01.98 Okay.
00:21:01.98 --> 00:21:03.98 So you show up in boot camp.
00:21:03.98 --> 00:21:06.98 And you have that shocked your system.
00:21:06.98 --> 00:21:07.98 Did you say to yourself, what did I do?
00:21:07.98 --> 00:21:08.98 My mom was right.
00:21:08.98 --> 00:21:09.98 Oh, yeah.
00:21:09.98 --> 00:21:12.98 I was college graduate.
00:21:12.98 --> 00:21:14.98 I went down my building.
00:21:14.98 --> 00:21:15.98 Yeah.
00:21:15.98 --> 00:21:18.98 But, uh, folding underwear.
00:21:18.98 --> 00:21:19.98 Yeah.
00:21:19.98 --> 00:21:22.98 I mean, I didn't have the worst boot camp experience.
00:21:22.98 --> 00:21:28.98 Um, early on, they had, you know, asked for, if anybody here had, uh,
00:21:28.98 --> 00:21:31.98 college experience and I had raised my hand.
00:21:31.98 --> 00:21:33.98 So I got made the division, y'all.
00:21:33.98 --> 00:21:37.98 And so I was able to kind of leave from time to time carrying the mail bag.
00:21:37.98 --> 00:21:40.98 And just carrying the mail bag for 45 minutes.
00:21:40.98 --> 00:21:42.98 I was just marching around the base.
00:21:42.98 --> 00:21:44.98 Yeah.
00:21:44.98 --> 00:21:49.98 So you get to, what was your, like, pre-training getting ready for butts?
00:21:49.98 --> 00:21:51.98 Did you do anything?
00:21:51.98 --> 00:21:52.98 Yeah.
00:21:52.98 --> 00:21:53.98 I just, hey, whatever.
00:21:53.98 --> 00:21:54.98 Yeah.
00:21:54.98 --> 00:22:01.98 I've been following the, um, uh, the butts, uh, pre, or the pre-buds training, uh, plan.
00:22:01.98 --> 00:22:07.98 Uh, like, you know, certain number of pull ups set up, uh, push ups everything and then running and swimming every day.
00:22:07.98 --> 00:22:09.98 So you felt like you're pretty good shape.
00:22:09.98 --> 00:22:10.98 No.
00:22:10.98 --> 00:22:11.98 I didn't.
00:22:11.98 --> 00:22:15.98 I thought I was an okay shape, uh, and I've been doing it for a year.
00:22:15.98 --> 00:22:25.98 Um, um, so about four months before I actually, uh, joined the Navy, I had, uh, linked up with the, uh,
00:22:25.98 --> 00:22:29.98 the Purdue ROTC guys that were all training to go to butts.
00:22:29.98 --> 00:22:33.98 And when I linked up with them, their training was on a completely other level.
00:22:33.98 --> 00:22:35.98 These guys were serious.
00:22:35.98 --> 00:22:37.98 They had, you know, they'd met Sealed before.
00:22:37.98 --> 00:22:39.98 I'd never met them at one.
00:22:39.98 --> 00:22:42.98 And so I did four months of, uh, training with them.
00:22:42.98 --> 00:22:44.98 I mean, I, I mean, these guys were all in ROTC.
00:22:44.98 --> 00:22:46.98 I was like, uh, a pony tail that appeared.
00:22:46.98 --> 00:22:48.98 I just, I was just a, looked like a piece of shit.
00:22:48.98 --> 00:22:50.98 So I'm not sure.
00:22:50.98 --> 00:22:52.98 I'm like, who the hell is this guy?
00:22:52.98 --> 00:22:54.98 You had a pony tail at a beard?
00:22:54.98 --> 00:22:55.98 What year was this?
00:22:55.98 --> 00:22:56.98 I was just, I'm not sure.
00:22:56.98 --> 00:22:57.98 Yeah.
00:22:57.98 --> 00:22:58.98 Yeah.
00:22:58.98 --> 00:22:59.98 In 1999.
00:22:59.98 --> 00:23:05.98 Uh, but what was funny is, uh, a year later when I graduated butts, uh, two of these guys were
00:23:05.98 --> 00:23:08.98 show, we were checking into butts the day I graduated.
00:23:08.98 --> 00:23:11.98 And I burst into their room, uh, to say hi.
00:23:11.98 --> 00:23:13.98 And they had no idea who it was.
00:23:13.98 --> 00:23:14.98 They made it.
00:23:14.98 --> 00:23:15.98 They told me.
00:23:15.98 --> 00:23:16.98 Yeah, that's awesome.
00:23:16.98 --> 00:23:18.98 Do was, uh, any challenges in butts?
00:23:18.98 --> 00:23:20.98 Anything that gave you a struggle?
00:23:20.98 --> 00:23:21.98 Uh, swimming.
00:23:21.98 --> 00:23:30.58 Uh, yeah, I had to, uh, um, I, I expected that, uh, swimming would, would be just like
00:23:30.58 --> 00:23:32.98 it was, uh, like, running was for me.
00:23:32.98 --> 00:23:36.98 Like, you'd start, uh, like running for, for me if I was going to do a long run.
00:23:36.98 --> 00:23:38.98 Go out at a moderate pace, that moderate pace.
00:23:38.98 --> 00:23:41.98 The further you go, we'd get harder to maintain.
00:23:41.98 --> 00:23:47.98 And then by the end of the race, uh, you know, you're, you're, uh, physically taxed, but you
00:23:47.98 --> 00:23:50.98 can, you know, gut through the, the last bit of pain.
00:23:50.98 --> 00:23:51.98 I swam like that.
00:23:51.98 --> 00:23:53.98 I swam at a moderate pace.
00:23:53.98 --> 00:23:56.98 And by the end of it, I was, I was pretty well-gast.
00:23:56.98 --> 00:23:57.98 Um, and it wasn't enough.
00:23:57.98 --> 00:24:00.98 So I started going every weekend of butts.
00:24:00.98 --> 00:24:05.98 I was, uh, linking up with, uh, a master chief nepper, uh, who I didn't know at the
00:24:05.98 --> 00:24:06.98 time.
00:24:06.98 --> 00:24:10.98 I mean, I just knew that he was, you know, a guy that would, you know, take pity on all the
00:24:10.98 --> 00:24:14.98 people, uh, and, uh, so when everybody else was relaxing and kind of, uh, you know,
00:24:14.98 --> 00:24:17.98 licking their wounds from the previous week, I was at the pool of Master Chief
00:24:17.98 --> 00:24:18.98 Nepper.
00:24:18.98 --> 00:24:19.98 I would not be here.
00:24:19.98 --> 00:24:22.98 Uh, or I would never have made it through if it wasn't for his classes.
00:24:22.98 --> 00:24:26.98 And I mean, little that I know that, you know, he was, uh, I mean, he's, you know,
00:24:26.98 --> 00:24:29.98 one of the oracles of, uh, seal history today.
00:24:29.98 --> 00:24:33.98 So, so you, grab, when did you graduate from butts?
00:24:33.98 --> 00:24:39.98 Um, he was August of, uh, 2000.
00:24:39.98 --> 00:24:40.98 Yeah.
00:24:40.98 --> 00:24:41.98 August 10th.
00:24:41.98 --> 00:24:44.98 My, my 20th year was, uh, 2001, 2001.
00:24:44.98 --> 00:24:45.98 Yeah.
00:24:45.98 --> 00:24:51.98 So you graduated August 2001, and then where did you get stationed?
00:24:51.98 --> 00:24:55.98 Uh, I was supposed to go to seal 10, but I went to seal 10 for East Coast.
00:24:55.98 --> 00:24:58.98 Just some paperwork, mix up or something?
00:24:58.98 --> 00:24:59.98 Yeah.
00:24:59.98 --> 00:25:03.98 The half of our class was going to seal 10, five and the other half was going to seal 10,
00:25:03.98 --> 00:25:05.98 for whatever reason, seal 10 hadn't quite stood up yet.
00:25:05.98 --> 00:25:07.98 So they switched us to, team four.
00:25:07.98 --> 00:25:10.98 So you, so where are you in September?
00:25:10.98 --> 00:25:12.98 So you graduate in August of 2001.
00:25:12.98 --> 00:25:13.98 Where are you?
00:25:13.98 --> 00:25:18.98 Where, where, where you actually standing when you, when September 11th goes down?
00:25:18.98 --> 00:25:24.98 I was home having just completed, uh, airborne.
00:25:24.98 --> 00:25:27.98 So I, I mean, like everybody else in my class.
00:25:27.98 --> 00:25:31.98 I'm, I, I immediately went, uh, went downstairs, pack my bag.
00:25:31.98 --> 00:25:33.98 I was ready to go on no call came.
00:25:33.98 --> 00:25:34.98 Thought you were going to nom.
00:25:34.98 --> 00:25:35.98 Like I did.
00:25:35.98 --> 00:25:38.98 And I thought I was going to nom in 1990.
00:25:38.98 --> 00:25:40.98 We were not got in, man.
00:25:40.98 --> 00:25:43.98 We were going nowhere, but disappointment.
00:25:43.98 --> 00:25:46.98 So you're at seal 10 for you.
00:25:46.98 --> 00:25:48.98 You, you get into a platoon.
00:25:48.98 --> 00:25:50.98 What job you, what job are you in the platoon?
00:25:50.98 --> 00:25:53.98 Uh, I was the, uh, 60 gunner.
00:25:53.98 --> 00:25:54.98 This is paid gunner.
00:25:54.98 --> 00:25:55.98 Big gunner.
00:25:55.98 --> 00:25:56.98 Yeah, freaking new guy.
00:25:56.98 --> 00:25:57.98 Yep, new guy.
00:25:57.98 --> 00:26:00.98 No, uh, no responsibility.
00:26:00.98 --> 00:26:03.98 Uh, I was the, uh, I was the, uh,
00:26:03.98 --> 00:26:05.98 I was the intel wrap of the platoon.
00:26:05.98 --> 00:26:06.98 Oh, yeah, that's right.
00:26:06.98 --> 00:26:07.98 They're like, oh, you went to college.
00:26:07.98 --> 00:26:08.98 Yeah.
00:26:08.98 --> 00:26:10.98 You can read intel wrap.
00:26:10.98 --> 00:26:11.98 Pro-street.
00:26:11.98 --> 00:26:13.98 What kind of platoon?
00:26:13.98 --> 00:26:15.98 So it's your team for you getting over tune.
00:26:15.98 --> 00:26:16.98 How is it?
00:26:16.98 --> 00:26:17.98 How's it work up?
00:26:17.98 --> 00:26:18.98 You have a good time?
00:26:18.98 --> 00:26:19.98 It was all right.
00:26:19.98 --> 00:26:21.98 I like, you know, there were some leadership challenges,
00:26:21.98 --> 00:26:22.98 but it was a good platoon.
00:26:22.98 --> 00:26:23.98 I mean, we had a good chief.
00:26:23.98 --> 00:26:24.98 A good OIC.
00:26:24.98 --> 00:26:28.98 Um, we, uh, we didn't have a great mission.
00:26:28.98 --> 00:26:30.98 We were, uh, we were a mark.
00:26:30.98 --> 00:26:32.98 So we've got attached to a, uh, you know, uh,
00:26:32.98 --> 00:26:35.98 uh, uh, uh, Marine, um, what was it,
00:26:35.98 --> 00:26:38.98 an LPD or LHA, something like that?
00:26:38.98 --> 00:26:40.98 And we were just sort of on call in the med.
00:26:40.98 --> 00:26:43.98 Um, you know, and at that point, you know,
00:26:43.98 --> 00:26:47.98 both, uh, uh, afghanistan and Iraq were going on.
00:26:47.98 --> 00:26:50.98 It was just, you know, we were sitting out in the,
00:26:50.98 --> 00:26:51.98 in the med just floating around.
00:26:51.98 --> 00:26:53.98 We didn't do anything until we,
00:26:53.98 --> 00:26:55.98 we got called, uh, go do Liberia.
00:26:55.98 --> 00:26:58.98 That was the, uh, the Liberian civil war.
00:26:58.98 --> 00:27:00.98 So we did some hydrographic reconnaissance,
00:27:00.98 --> 00:27:03.98 as stuff like that. You got your lead line and slayed out.
00:27:03.98 --> 00:27:05.98 I did ride a line.
00:27:05.98 --> 00:27:06.98 I did.
00:27:06.98 --> 00:27:10.98 And I was, uh, so we had done, uh,
00:27:10.98 --> 00:27:12.98 probably half a dozen of these things.
00:27:12.98 --> 00:27:15.98 Um, and then the, the last one that we were doing was, uh,
00:27:15.98 --> 00:27:20.98 directly in front of the, uh, uh, the US embassy in Manrovia.
00:27:20.98 --> 00:27:22.98 Um, and, um,
00:27:22.98 --> 00:27:26.98 um, I was probably the closest swimmer to the beach,
00:27:26.98 --> 00:27:29.98 which meant I was the closest swimmer to the sea and un-camera.
00:27:29.98 --> 00:27:30.98 Uh-huh.
00:27:30.98 --> 00:27:33.98 I got that out there and if anybody knew my, my history with swimming,
00:27:33.98 --> 00:27:36.98 I probably would've pushed me further back.
00:27:36.98 --> 00:27:39.98 Uh, but so I'm, you know, paralleling the beaches were doing this
00:27:39.98 --> 00:27:43.98 and I know that, you know, the whole world is watching and at some point I got wrapped up in my
00:27:43.98 --> 00:27:44.98 led line.
00:27:44.98 --> 00:27:47.98 I was like, oh my gosh.
00:27:47.98 --> 00:27:48.98 And I'm tied up in this thing.
00:27:48.98 --> 00:27:49.98 I can't swim.
00:27:49.98 --> 00:27:51.98 It's a really close shore breaks.
00:27:51.98 --> 00:27:53.98 So I'm getting hammered with waves.
00:27:53.98 --> 00:27:56.98 I bounce my head off of big rock.
00:27:56.98 --> 00:27:58.98 Like, I've got to get out of this line so I pull out my knife.
00:27:58.98 --> 00:28:02.98 my knife and I start cutting this thing. The way this coming up on me and I'm getting
00:28:02.98 --> 00:28:06.98 ready to get slammed with this thing and I don't want to stab myself while I'm doing this.
00:28:06.98 --> 00:28:12.58 And so I look around, I got no, I'm holding the slate with one hand, I got the knife
00:28:12.58 --> 00:28:17.86 and the other, and I need something to swim with. So I did the only thing I could do.
00:28:17.86 --> 00:28:22.98 I put my knife in my mouth and I started and I swam through the stroke. Like how
00:28:22.98 --> 00:28:24.98 world were to frog men is better.
00:28:24.98 --> 00:28:32.74 Oh, that's for you, you know, awesome. So you get done with that deployment. That was kind of the
00:28:32.74 --> 00:28:36.10 highlight of the deployment was doing hydrographic reconnaissance in the library.
00:28:36.10 --> 00:28:39.14 Well, I want to brag. But yeah, it's freaking legit.
00:28:39.14 --> 00:28:40.50 Yeah.
00:28:40.50 --> 00:28:50.26 Uh, hey, I did two arc platoon out on the west coast and I've done so many hydrographic reconnaidences.
00:28:50.26 --> 00:28:57.54 It's ridiculous. But I guess I've never done like a, um, I did real ones but they weren't in combat.
00:28:57.54 --> 00:29:03.22 They were like in Kuwait. They was real. Like someone was like land there. I mean, but didn't get,
00:29:03.22 --> 00:29:07.78 I never put my mouth in my, I make my knife and my teeth and swam out. But I think you could
00:29:07.78 --> 00:29:11.30 probably agree it's not the reason you joined the field teams, not Kuwait. Why join the
00:29:11.30 --> 00:29:18.90 sealed teams? And that must be, so what'd you do after that? Uh, I had some, you know, sort of family
00:29:18.90 --> 00:29:24.18 challenges. So I briefly got out until figured out where I was going to be living. When I finally
00:29:24.18 --> 00:29:31.78 found out I was going to be living in San Diego. Uh, I put my OCS package back together. I really wanted
00:29:31.78 --> 00:29:35.70 to go back to the teams and be an officer. Soccer coach, write to another letter.
00:29:35.70 --> 00:29:43.30 Reclamation. I actually had a few decent letters and I was, uh, I just got in San Diego. I,
00:29:43.30 --> 00:29:48.10 I, I, I, I contracted, uh, in my, you know, during that year off, Blackwater triple canopy.
00:29:49.46 --> 00:29:53.78 Uh, but where did you go Iraq? Iraq, you know, and what were you doing just PSD basically?
00:29:53.78 --> 00:30:02.26 Yes, yeah. But once we got in the San Diego, um, I, uh, where were you in, uh, where were
00:30:02.26 --> 00:30:10.98 Iraq, where you in what years? Uh, well, that was, uh, 2004, 2004, 2005. I mean, I, I, I, I guess it was 2005.
00:30:10.98 --> 00:30:17.62 I was back in the teams by 2006. What's PSD? Personal security detail. Yeah, it's like doing
00:30:17.62 --> 00:30:23.54 security. Yeah, so that's what a lot of the contractors were doing. You're doing security for
00:30:23.54 --> 00:30:27.46 other government workers. And those government workers could be people working on telephone lines.
00:30:27.46 --> 00:30:34.98 They could be CIA people. They could be government people. But it's basically security. Gotcha.
00:30:34.98 --> 00:30:40.58 So that's where many of those contracting jobs were for guys that were in special operations.
00:30:40.58 --> 00:30:47.86 Just doing security. That's, um, so how long were you out for that year?
00:30:49.38 --> 00:30:54.74 Then you come back in. You wait. What happened with your OCS package? So my OCS package was, uh,
00:30:54.74 --> 00:31:01.46 I really just needed my last letter of recommendation. So I was in the, uh, uh, the group one
00:31:01.46 --> 00:31:06.58 commander's office for my, for my interview. He was kind enough to give me an interview.
00:31:07.62 --> 00:31:12.34 I had been getting ready for that interview for a while. And, uh, the morning of the interview,
00:31:12.34 --> 00:31:20.82 I was, uh, contacted by a seal team 18 and said I was recalled. So I was like, well, it's not the
00:31:20.82 --> 00:31:24.98 end of the world. But let's see if I can get this, you know, OCS package signed off on.
00:31:24.98 --> 00:31:28.66 So if you serve everyone knows, seal team 18 is a reserve seal team.
00:31:28.66 --> 00:31:32.50 Correct. Or if you're in the, if you get out of this team, then you want to stay connected. You can go
00:31:32.50 --> 00:31:36.98 in the reserves. Yeah. That's what that is. So you got recalled. How many teams are there? Oh, like,
00:31:36.98 --> 00:31:42.10 all together. Or eight seal teams, uh, there are eight seal teams at the time for our
00:31:42.10 --> 00:31:47.30 on each coast and then there's that group. But then, uh, in addition to the, uh, uh, eight active
00:31:47.30 --> 00:31:52.66 duty team plus that group, there's there were two reserve seal teams with sort of a new concept.
00:31:52.66 --> 00:31:59.30 They, they were trying. So they got eight teams plus two reserve teams. So 10 and then dev group 11.
00:32:00.34 --> 00:32:04.34 Yeah. I guess. That's not in the way. Yeah. Kind of. There's some other things. But yeah. Yeah.
00:32:05.14 --> 00:32:09.70 So because when you say team, that's like a technical thing like, yeah, because you got S.D.V.
00:32:09.70 --> 00:32:16.50 teams to write. Right. Right. Right. Our also teams got, but the numbers, though, because that's
00:32:16.50 --> 00:32:22.10 well, you got S.D.V. team one and S.D.V. team two. So you got another two teams. All right.
00:32:22.10 --> 00:32:26.50 This goes deep. So you can't leave S.D.V.s. Yeah. I understand that boys are working hard. It's
00:32:26.50 --> 00:32:32.74 a different hard. Um, so I'm in the off and I'm, uh, I, you know, I, I knew that, you know, I, I've
00:32:32.74 --> 00:32:37.38 found out that morning. I was getting recalled, but still hoping that, you know, the, uh, uh, the
00:32:37.38 --> 00:32:43.14 captain could, uh, maybe figure something out. So I do the interview. Interview goes great. I think,
00:32:43.14 --> 00:32:47.54 and, uh, he's like, do you have anything for me? And I said, well, sir, um, not for nothing, but
00:32:47.54 --> 00:32:51.62 I just got recalled this morning. Uh, I was wondering if there's anything you could do, you know,
00:32:51.62 --> 00:32:55.14 I'd really like to, you know, follow through on the socials packaging, come back to the teams as an
00:32:55.14 --> 00:33:02.26 officer. And he just said, now that sucks. So I found myself back in the teams, but, you know,
00:33:02.26 --> 00:33:06.98 it was the best thing that could have ever happened. I went to seal team five and, uh, jumped on a
00:33:06.98 --> 00:33:12.42 great, putton, a great leadership and, you know, uh, that we, we followed you. Yeah, you guys
00:33:12.42 --> 00:33:18.10 really dust, not my task unit, but you guys went to hobby. Yeah. Yep. So you rolled out to hobby
00:33:18.10 --> 00:33:23.54 and you were a reservist that was activated. Yep. And they put you in a putton. Yep.
00:33:23.54 --> 00:33:28.42 Well, that's freaking awesome. It was, yeah, it was great. Did you do any of the work up or anything?
00:33:28.42 --> 00:33:32.90 Yeah. So you did the work up, went on to point it, but your reservist, but your
00:33:32.90 --> 00:33:38.34 in a putton. Yeah. What was your job? Uh, R2, or the radio telephone up, I was the
00:33:38.34 --> 00:33:42.58 com guy. I did a little bit of breaching, but then, you know, kind of taught myself how to be a J-tech,
00:33:42.58 --> 00:33:46.82 but that's a interesting thing to try and teach yourself while you're on the ground in hobby.
00:33:46.82 --> 00:33:50.90 And not only that, but, you know, I knew that the putton needed a com guy.
00:33:51.78 --> 00:33:55.70 I'd been to com school and never been a com guy, but they asked for a com guy and I said,
00:33:55.70 --> 00:34:01.70 yes, I'm the best com. That is time. I thought I'd do it. So it's good to call.
00:34:01.70 --> 00:34:09.30 Yeah. How was that deployment? It was great. What were you guys doing hobby in O-6, O-7?
00:34:09.30 --> 00:34:13.46 That was like the winner of O-6 into O-7, right? Correct. What kind of was your missions?
00:34:13.46 --> 00:34:16.98 What were you guys doing? We were doing a lot of, you know, sniper overwatches and then,
00:34:18.10 --> 00:34:24.26 just doing a go-in house after house. You know, doing little, uh, well, house to house raids,
00:34:24.26 --> 00:34:28.02 looking for al Qaeda, just like you guys weren't there. So you're kind of living the dream.
00:34:28.02 --> 00:34:33.06 I was living, I was doing exactly what I thought I would be doing and when I enlisted in 2000.
00:34:35.46 --> 00:34:40.90 Yeah. Yeah. That's good. I always felt that way when I was in Iraq. I felt like I was
00:34:41.70 --> 00:34:48.58 so lucky to be where I was. And then I will say in Ramadi it was a little next level because,
00:34:48.58 --> 00:34:54.90 you know, when you're a kid, you kind of look, I was thinking, no, you know, my whole life, I was thinking,
00:34:54.90 --> 00:35:00.58 no, right? But even, there was something even a little bit more seem like a little bit extra,
00:35:00.58 --> 00:35:04.82 was straight up World War Two, right? You're thinking World War Two, you think it takes,
00:35:04.82 --> 00:35:09.86 it's stuff. So in Ramadi, there was times where tanks were rolling down the street,
00:35:09.86 --> 00:35:14.58 rolling in through buildings, over walls, it was WWE.
00:35:16.42 --> 00:35:23.14 And man, it was freaking awesome. Yeah. But you're right. I mean, I mean, I had that
00:35:23.14 --> 00:35:30.02 non-expectation too and we got there. It was a, it was a ground war. The only thing that made it sort of
00:35:30.02 --> 00:35:34.42 non-like is the Fratee River. Oh, yeah, for sure. And we would use the Sockars,
00:35:35.22 --> 00:35:40.50 Tensert and, you know, there's only so many boat guys on the Sockars and sometimes they're alternating
00:35:40.50 --> 00:35:45.06 between right or port and starboard side guns. So if they didn't have anybody on, you know,
00:35:45.06 --> 00:35:52.10 a gun, you just stand up and you grab one. And yeah, you're in a t-shirt and rolling up your Fratee's
00:35:52.10 --> 00:36:02.18 River. And there was an area, an whole AO called OneMC or MC1. I can't remember, but it was up north,
00:36:03.30 --> 00:36:08.98 kind of north east of the town of Ramadi and it was on the north side of the river. And it
00:36:08.98 --> 00:36:15.22 looked like nom. It was ridiculous. It plus we had the Marine Corps, he was flying around.
00:36:15.22 --> 00:36:20.34 And we called it V at ROM because it was like, there's Ramadi, but it looked like V at ROM. And it was
00:36:20.34 --> 00:36:27.94 freaking crazy right on. And so you get done with that deployment and then what what are you doing
00:36:27.94 --> 00:36:35.94 you get home? At that point, I started thinking about grad school. Okay, I was,
00:36:36.98 --> 00:36:40.82 so you were a reserve. So when you got home, were you released from active duty kind of?
00:36:40.82 --> 00:36:46.90 Yeah, I went to, but I managed to parlay that and to going over to workhouse. I worked for a
00:36:46.90 --> 00:36:52.58 couple of years over at work home. And I, my platoon chief from Seal Team 5 was going over there to
00:36:53.38 --> 00:37:00.74 run the J-TAC program. And you know, I kind of taught myself how to do all that. So he said if you want,
00:37:00.74 --> 00:37:05.06 you can come over work with me what you're going to grad school. And so we just, we just did J-TAC
00:37:05.06 --> 00:37:10.74 stuff for the next two years while I went through. I got my degree. Where did you go to school?
00:37:10.74 --> 00:37:17.22 USD. Oh, I went to undergrad there. Did you? I'd use USD.
00:37:17.22 --> 00:37:22.34 Gorgeous. That's a nice place. And then when you're thinking, hey, we still think about trying to
00:37:22.34 --> 00:37:27.38 put that OCS package in or I was, I mean, I had, it was on the sort of the back burner. I was trying
00:37:27.38 --> 00:37:33.86 to decide whether or not it was going to go put the OCS package to go back active or do like an
00:37:33.86 --> 00:37:41.62 FTS package and get a commission in the reserves. So I had my first kid and once I had the first
00:37:41.62 --> 00:37:47.86 kid, I was like, I don't want to leave this guy. So I went with the reserves. So I got a commission.
00:37:47.86 --> 00:37:52.82 So the day I left active duty. I got a commission in the reserves.
00:37:53.70 --> 00:37:57.38 Oh, so you did end up getting a commission reserves? I did. You still have it right now?
00:37:57.38 --> 00:38:02.02 Well, I'm out of the reserves now. Oh, okay. I left left the reserves four years ago.
00:38:02.02 --> 00:38:09.38 Or maybe a little more. So you get done. And now you realize you want to stay home with the kid.
00:38:09.38 --> 00:38:14.42 And so then what you're trying to put your life together on the outside, how's that, though?
00:38:15.14 --> 00:38:23.14 No, great. Like any guy who leaves the, you know, their dream job and suddenly finds themselves
00:38:23.14 --> 00:38:29.46 doing something they never expected to do. It didn't go great, Jaco. I was, you know, like everybody
00:38:29.46 --> 00:38:36.66 trying to figure out what my next, my next big thing was looking for relevance in any, any area that
00:38:36.66 --> 00:38:45.14 I could find it. And I quickly realized that in my business life, I was not going to be successful.
00:38:46.34 --> 00:38:51.86 What business is the joy? Well, I first office, I started at a textile manufacturer and
00:38:51.86 --> 00:38:57.94 feel we were trying to get back to family because we had, you know, I had a new kid and probably
00:38:57.94 --> 00:39:05.14 another one on the way. So my wife at the time lived in South Jersey. So we went there.
00:39:06.02 --> 00:39:13.62 So I got a job, a textile manufacturer and Philly and they were great people. And I really liked
00:39:13.62 --> 00:39:18.82 the company and I was just terrible at it. You know, they wanted to start like a tactical
00:39:18.82 --> 00:39:28.10 product's line and I thought I'd try, you know, business and yeah, I didn't do well. I didn't do
00:39:28.10 --> 00:39:32.98 terrible, but I just like I don't, I don't know what I'm doing. So I started thinking about this
00:39:33.70 --> 00:39:39.06 right about then. I was like, there's only two things that I can do. And, you know,
00:39:40.58 --> 00:39:45.70 I don't want to leave the kid and all right, you know, at that time it was, you know, one kid
00:39:45.70 --> 00:39:52.10 had become two. So I started thinking about this. What was the catalyst that made you actually
00:39:53.46 --> 00:39:56.58 get out your computer, open the word processor and start typing?
00:39:59.30 --> 00:40:09.22 That was probably extortion one seven. So like everybody I went to, you know, you know,
00:40:09.22 --> 00:40:19.22 quite a few of the funerals after that. And I went to J. T. S. Funer of John Thomelson. He was,
00:40:20.42 --> 00:40:28.82 he was from the rockford Iowa. So I went to his funeral and totally unexpected. But when I was there,
00:40:28.82 --> 00:40:36.74 I met Jim Hornfisher or James D. Hornfisher. That's his author name, but he was a literary agent.
00:40:36.74 --> 00:40:44.10 And he was, but he was also a, probably the, you know, the greatest, you know, naval historian in the country.
00:40:44.98 --> 00:40:51.94 He had written last stand of the tin cancels, Neptune's in Fernow. So when I got to J. T. S. Funerl,
00:40:51.94 --> 00:40:57.46 everybody's there, he's drinking. I see this guy who's totally out of place. He's six foot five,
00:40:57.46 --> 00:41:06.26 you know, whereas glass is just kind of, not a team guy clearly. And one of my friends quickly,
00:41:06.26 --> 00:41:11.38 you know, realizes that, you know, he has the two biggest nerds at the event and he introduces us
00:41:11.38 --> 00:41:17.14 and was in 30 seconds. I knew that this was a guy that was going to change my life.
00:41:18.26 --> 00:41:24.42 So we started talking to the military. We got, got pretty little up, kept his business card in my pocket
00:41:24.42 --> 00:41:30.90 for the next year. It was kind of, you know, secretly working on an idea for a book.
00:41:32.34 --> 00:41:39.94 And after a year, I sent him a cold email and just, you know, here's a chapter. I want to take a look at it
00:41:39.94 --> 00:41:45.46 and he sent an email back and he said, this is fantastic. And I spent the next six months putting
00:41:45.46 --> 00:41:51.70 an outline together for what the rest of the book would look like. And he took that to New York and
00:41:51.70 --> 00:41:58.34 he got a contract. So they gave me a two-year contract, you know, the next eight years working on it.
00:41:59.06 --> 00:42:02.98 They gave you a two-year contract. Yeah. And you just kept saying,
00:42:03.78 --> 00:42:08.66 I just kept thinking going, I just got a contract. Yeah, no, it wasn't that. It was like, I just,
00:42:09.46 --> 00:42:14.98 you know, they wanted, they wanted a product that I quickly realized I couldn't give them.
00:42:15.54 --> 00:42:20.74 So I knew that, what did they want? They wanted a, they wanted a history of the, of the teams,
00:42:20.74 --> 00:42:27.70 but they wanted it done quickly. Like everybody, I mean, you can, so I knew that if I did that,
00:42:27.70 --> 00:42:31.22 then the history that I was going to write was going to be like every other history that
00:42:31.22 --> 00:42:37.46 I've been written on the teams sort of just wave tops. And I knew that it wasn't going to be written
00:42:37.46 --> 00:42:43.22 with any sort of intent beyond, you know, just my own interest in each of the events. I knew
00:42:43.22 --> 00:42:48.98 I knew that the, I knew the teams deserved something like this. I just didn't know how to do this.
00:42:48.98 --> 00:42:56.02 So I just kind of broke the whole thing down. I found a bunch of, I found two or three books that I
00:42:56.02 --> 00:43:02.42 really liked. I read each of them three or four times. One of them I went through and I literally
00:43:02.42 --> 00:43:07.70 outlined it, you know, not page by page, but like chapter by chapters. Like this chapter is doing this,
00:43:07.70 --> 00:43:12.98 this chapter is doing this. And I just sort of broke it down. How does this author?
00:43:12.98 --> 00:43:18.10 You know, when I found another author, how does this author introduce characters? How do they,
00:43:18.10 --> 00:43:22.98 you know, how do they just, you know, structure or how do they, you know, we've multiple storylines
00:43:22.98 --> 00:43:29.94 together. And I just kind of taught myself how to do this. Did you, but I knew, I knew that they,
00:43:29.94 --> 00:43:34.66 that, you know, this was going to take me a lot longer than two years. So when they gave you two years,
00:43:34.66 --> 00:43:39.06 what did you, did you just sign the contract and just sign the contract? No, is that you would,
00:43:39.06 --> 00:43:43.54 yeah, I did the same thing. I did it, sealed team five. You know, I said, yeah, I'm a con guy.
00:43:43.54 --> 00:43:48.58 I just, you said, you all right this in two years? Yeah. How pissed were they when you kept
00:43:48.58 --> 00:43:55.62 messing the deadline by five years? You know, two, they're credit. They didn't bother me.
00:43:56.58 --> 00:44:05.22 They would check in. And the only thing that they really did was, they, they wanted to see the first chapter.
00:44:05.22 --> 00:44:13.30 So once the first chapter was finished, I sent that off and they said, okay, this is, and I, it took me
00:44:15.86 --> 00:44:22.58 between six and seven months to write that first chapter on the Raiders. How many hours a day would you
00:44:22.58 --> 00:44:30.98 work? I would start at 430 and I would work until about eight. And then I would, you know, do
00:44:30.98 --> 00:44:37.54 rest of my day and then I'd come home, I'd get my kids to bed. And then once I put them to bed,
00:44:37.54 --> 00:44:41.22 I'd work as long as I couldn't till I was just kind of smoked. So you're probably getting like
00:44:41.22 --> 00:44:51.46 five, six hours a day on the book? Yeah. For, yeah. Yeah, I mean, I'll tell you what, we'll get into the book.
00:44:51.46 --> 00:44:57.70 Now, but before we do the book is freaking, it's, it's an incredible book and the detail you go into,
00:44:57.70 --> 00:45:05.94 it's over 500 pages long. I'll read a fraction of that today. It was so hard for me to
00:45:05.94 --> 00:45:13.30 figure out what to, what parts to read. I guess I could have talked to you about it. Maybe we could
00:45:13.30 --> 00:45:18.34 have discussed it, but I just kind of like, every page has got really important stuff on it.
00:45:19.62 --> 00:45:27.14 The writing's terrific, clearly and unmistakably you sourced it from a lot of first-person accounts,
00:45:27.14 --> 00:45:33.78 you know, capture documents, or information captured from documents, from official traffic,
00:45:33.78 --> 00:45:39.22 from interviews, from other sources. It reads like an action novel in many parts,
00:45:39.22 --> 00:45:44.82 except for the fact that it's all true, which makes it even better to read. So this book, I can't
00:45:44.82 --> 00:45:49.70 recommend this book enough, just a fantastic history. And it's not, it's not just about the
00:45:49.70 --> 00:45:58.66 seals because one of the premises of the book is that seals wouldn't exist if either really the
00:45:58.66 --> 00:46:09.54 Marine Corps or the Army would have stuck to and committed, committed to the idea of having
00:46:09.54 --> 00:46:15.38 these kind of direct action raiders, which is what the seal teams ends up being. And everybody's got
00:46:15.38 --> 00:46:20.58 it kind of got it now, you could say, but for many years there was many attempts at doing this,
00:46:21.70 --> 00:46:29.38 and they wouldn't work out for various reasons. Maybe a mission would go bad or a war would end
00:46:29.38 --> 00:46:33.22 or a combination of those two things, or you know, when you're in the Army and you're a general,
00:46:33.22 --> 00:46:39.86 when you got some cowboy looking guy running around, and you're senior to that cowboy looking
00:46:39.86 --> 00:46:44.18 guy, you think I don't want this guy running around? I'm going to disband his whole organization,
00:46:44.18 --> 00:46:48.58 or you're in the Marine Corps, you do the same thing. Hey, you know, I was in the Marine Corps,
00:46:48.58 --> 00:46:52.74 Marine Corps is right in tight, you know, and now who's this guy running around with freaking
00:46:52.74 --> 00:46:57.78 long hair? No, I'm going to disband that whole organization, and that seems to happen a lot. There's
00:46:57.78 --> 00:47:04.74 one group, the Navy, where you're in the Navy, so you're sort of, you know, if you're to
00:47:04.74 --> 00:47:10.74 add real Navy, you kind of want to have some of these pipe editors running around that can make
00:47:10.74 --> 00:47:15.06 something happen, and that's, I think, part of the, part of the genesis of the seal teams. So,
00:47:17.14 --> 00:47:26.10 book is fantastic. Let's get into some of this. So, here we go. On August 8th,
00:47:26.10 --> 00:47:31.54 at 0900, both submarines departed sub-based Pearl Harbor and made it for the open ocean.
00:47:31.54 --> 00:47:38.26 It was in the lead was the notalist with Carlson and 87 Raiders of B company, following almost a
00:47:38.26 --> 00:47:44.58 day behind was the larger and slower Argonaut with Roosevelt and the remaining 134 men,
00:47:44.58 --> 00:47:49.62 the majority belong to A company. For eight, sweltering days, the Raiders lived crammed alongside
00:47:49.62 --> 00:47:55.14 each other, anywhere they could stretch each man, a prisoner to, to the heat, sweat, and stink of the
00:47:55.14 --> 00:48:01.78 one next to him. After 2,000 miles of the specifics omnipotent slightly farther than New York
00:48:01.78 --> 00:48:06.98 city to San Diego, the notalist finally arrived at its target on August 16th. So, these are marine
00:48:06.98 --> 00:48:11.38 Raiders. Group that have been put together to go out, they're conducting freaking sub-operations
00:48:12.50 --> 00:48:19.86 in World War II. Fast forward, and that's, you know, obviously I'm only reading chunks of the book.
00:48:19.86 --> 00:48:25.22 So, it seems a little bit stilled or, or you don't recognize some of the names. Believe me,
00:48:25.22 --> 00:48:29.22 every person that's in this book is described, you know, you give an incredible background on
00:48:29.22 --> 00:48:33.62 people where they came from, how they got in the situation they're in. So, when you hear me
00:48:33.62 --> 00:48:36.66 jumping, you haven't heard of a character, it's just because I haven't read, I'm not reading
00:48:36.66 --> 00:48:41.78 you the entire book. Fast forward a little bit, sensing his momentum, eroding like the ground beneath
00:48:41.78 --> 00:48:46.74 him Carlson, sloth through the soft sand, hastening to gather his men before the sun rose.
00:48:46.74 --> 00:48:51.46 Obviously, they've been inserted at this point. If he could find the, find an untangle,
00:48:51.46 --> 00:48:55.22 his two reduced companies, and point them in the direction of their targets, he might still have a
00:48:55.22 --> 00:49:02.10 chance. Because there had been no reconnaissance, however, no one knew for sure where, or where,
00:49:02.10 --> 00:49:07.86 where they were, or where to go, with four miles of beach to the left, and another six miles
00:49:07.86 --> 00:49:13.14 to the right, with targets, their targets could be anywhere, if their targets were there at all.
00:49:13.86 --> 00:49:19.94 We're still one whole boat crew is missing. Without target locations or knowledge of enemy strength,
00:49:21.30 --> 00:49:27.30 the 13 men, with 13 men on accountant for and possibly drowned, Carlson was blind and
00:49:27.30 --> 00:49:32.98 groping for answers in an ever-brightening world, his men becoming ridiculously conspicuous,
00:49:32.98 --> 00:49:38.50 along the white beaches in their uniforms of dyed black. So this is already off to a bad start
00:49:38.50 --> 00:49:50.10 with these guys. Yeah, they, uh, yeah, I don't know what to say. I mean, I, uh, the, um,
00:49:50.10 --> 00:49:58.50 right, organizing the book, I knew where I knew where I needed the book to end. I knew that the book
00:49:58.50 --> 00:50:02.74 would end in Vietnam because in Vietnam, it's in Vietnam that the seal teams become what they are
00:50:02.74 --> 00:50:09.38 today. Land focus, go anywhere, commandos. What he did know was how it happened, and I didn't have,
00:50:09.38 --> 00:50:15.38 like, you know, uh, in order to, you know, decide what a book's going to be, you've got to have,
00:50:15.38 --> 00:50:19.22 you know, not just an endpoint, you're going to have a beginning point. So I needed to find
00:50:19.22 --> 00:50:28.58 that first instance where the Navy, um, the Navy had that, uh, that desired to create some sort of
00:50:28.58 --> 00:50:35.06 rating unit. Now, we all know that, you know, the Marine Corps is a department of the Navy.
00:50:35.06 --> 00:50:42.10 So the Navy has its own army. Uh, and so logically, the Marine Corps should have been able to
00:50:42.10 --> 00:50:47.86 feel that first commando unit that worked directly for the Navy. The reason that they don't do
00:50:47.86 --> 00:50:54.02 that ultimately, uh, happens, you know, in the opening days of World War II, and all happens because
00:50:54.02 --> 00:50:59.70 of this make an island rate. The Marine Corps doesn't want the readers, uh, the, uh, the Marine
00:50:59.70 --> 00:51:03.78 Corps wants what it's always wanted, or, or not what it's always wanted. They want what they've
00:51:03.78 --> 00:51:10.02 wanted since World War I. And World War I, the Marine Corps, uh, becomes every bit as, uh,
00:51:10.02 --> 00:51:14.74 consequential as the US Army. So the leaders of the Marine Corps who all fought on the battlefield,
00:51:14.74 --> 00:51:19.94 the first World War, they feel like when World War II happens, uh, they can finally, uh, achieve
00:51:19.94 --> 00:51:25.78 the status that their service has long, uh, uh, uh, deserved. So they're not interested in, uh,
00:51:25.78 --> 00:51:29.30 being the Navy's anything. They're, they're, they're, they're interested in being their own branch
00:51:29.30 --> 00:51:36.90 of service completely, uh, uh, uh, uh, you know, subservient to themselves. Uh, so when the Navy says,
00:51:36.90 --> 00:51:42.50 they want to, uh, spread the Japanese, uh, attention away from the Solomon's or away from the South
00:51:42.50 --> 00:51:46.50 Pacific and do this raid, Marine Corps thinks well, it's, you know, it's not really what we should
00:51:46.50 --> 00:51:51.54 be doing, but we'll do it just because the Navy wants it. So when it, it predictably, uh, when they
00:51:51.54 --> 00:51:57.86 send, uh, these raiders up there, uh, with a, uh, commander that the Marine Corps really didn't want
00:51:57.86 --> 00:52:04.58 it. They really didn't like Carlson. Uh, it, it goes predictably bad and then the Marine Corps just
00:52:04.58 --> 00:52:09.86 ifies the reason, uh, that they never wanted them in the first place. It's, it's interesting, um,
00:52:09.86 --> 00:52:14.74 even when, and I don't know if you'll remember this because it might be a little bit, but you
00:52:14.74 --> 00:52:22.34 didn't come in until 2000. Yeah, when I came in, the, the, the Marine Corps attitude was, what we don't
00:52:22.34 --> 00:52:27.06 need a special operations group inside the Marine Corps because all Marines are special.
00:52:27.06 --> 00:52:34.58 Yeah, and that's that was a 200% their attitude and they kept that, like, to the T when I was in,
00:52:34.58 --> 00:52:42.10 that was, that was just how they rolled, was, was through that. Um, yeah, I mean, they, they have
00:52:42.10 --> 00:52:46.50 had that attitude since the first, well, since World War II, but it's in the first world,
00:52:46.50 --> 00:52:55.38 they, they, they realized what they can be. Yeah, which is a parallel army. You, uh, the, the, the,
00:52:55.38 --> 00:53:00.34 the work that you did to research these, these battles and you go into so much detail with them.
00:53:00.34 --> 00:53:05.46 I mean, here we go and back to the book real quick, um, for the next 30 minutes, a company
00:53:05.46 --> 00:53:10.34 fought a suicidal enemy armed with four machine guns, two grenade throwers, automatic rifles,
00:53:10.34 --> 00:53:13.86 and a flame thrower. Each time the Raiders managed to silence a machine gun, nest another
00:53:13.86 --> 00:53:17.46 Japanese gun, which step over the piled bodies surrounding it and bring it to life.
00:53:17.46 --> 00:53:22.26 Worst of all unseen and inscapable were the snipers, last to the tops of the palms,
00:53:22.26 --> 00:53:27.22 not blinded by the sun and rewarded for their patients. Each sniper sought out, movement and took
00:53:27.22 --> 00:53:32.26 aim. We pleaded with Thompson to stay down one man remembered years later, there were snipers
00:53:32.26 --> 00:53:37.14 within 50 yards of us. He did not compelled instead to shuttle between his men pointing out
00:53:37.14 --> 00:53:43.14 targets as he went. His metal of honor was awarded posh, mostly. We had japs in front of us,
00:53:43.14 --> 00:53:49.22 above us, alongside us, to our left and behind us remembered Corporal Young, exposed at the
00:53:49.22 --> 00:53:54.58 tip of the cold asak, even when they managed to fight free of the Japanese around them,
00:53:54.58 --> 00:53:59.22 their good sense kept them nailed to the ground. I lay as fat as flat as I could and tried to
00:53:59.22 --> 00:54:04.82 shrink myself as narrow as possible, said private Glenn Lincoln, playing possum under the palm trees
00:54:04.82 --> 00:54:09.78 and the scrutiny of two separate machine gun positions. In 30 minutes, nine Raiders from second
00:54:09.78 --> 00:54:17.14 platoon were dead. So was Thompson. So was Lieutenant Jerry Holtham, the battalion intelligence officer,
00:54:17.14 --> 00:54:22.18 a child of missionaries and the one Raider who could speak Japanese. Also killed were four
00:54:22.18 --> 00:54:27.70 radio telephones operators, each one singled out by the antenna wagling above his shoulder,
00:54:27.70 --> 00:54:32.74 which was connected to a waterlogged radio that either lacked the power to reach Carlson's command
00:54:32.74 --> 00:54:42.34 post or did not work at all. So like you said, this is just a disaster. This situation.
00:54:42.34 --> 00:54:49.70 It's a disaster, but it highlights even though each branch of service has leaders that have
00:54:49.70 --> 00:54:55.62 their own purposes for creating these units at various times for various reasons. In each
00:54:55.62 --> 00:55:02.98 instance, whether it's Raiders or Rangers or Lerps or whatever, the guys on the ground,
00:55:03.94 --> 00:55:13.46 these are, I mean, every bit is heroic and deserving of our respect as the seals that their
00:55:13.46 --> 00:55:22.82 legacy is ultimately funnel into. So the branches of service don't support their efforts.
00:55:22.82 --> 00:55:27.94 Now for one various reasons, it takes a long time to get there. But you're right, you said it,
00:55:28.98 --> 00:55:33.86 you're opening remarks. I mean, this history or this institution, the seal teams,
00:55:33.86 --> 00:55:40.42 could not have come to be, would not have come to be a landfocus command or unit,
00:55:40.42 --> 00:55:45.54 had it not been for the gap that the Army and the Marine Corps and the CIA were the OSS
00:55:45.54 --> 00:55:52.74 continually provide over this 30-year period of history. So that kind of, as you mentioned,
00:55:52.74 --> 00:55:58.50 that kind of, that first raid that making raid kind of put a, put a damper on the enthusiasm
00:55:58.50 --> 00:56:07.30 of the Marine Corps to go out and make one of these units. Fast forward a little bit, you say this,
00:56:07.30 --> 00:56:12.18 in the book, in May 1942, an anticipation of the Army's need, the Navy issued a narrow call for
00:56:12.18 --> 00:56:18.10 volunteers to join something called the amphibious commandos. What made the call narrow was that it
00:56:18.10 --> 00:56:23.86 seemed to be directed at a single group. That group was, in the words of one reported, the 600 or so
00:56:23.86 --> 00:56:30.82 quote, educated muscle men who had signed on as assistant instructors to the Navy's physical fitness
00:56:30.82 --> 00:56:35.70 program. These were led by the most educated muscle man of his day, Lieutenant Commander James
00:56:35.70 --> 00:56:42.74 Joseph Green, Tony, I'm saying that right, Tony, Tony, Tony, six feet tall, equipped with heavy
00:56:42.74 --> 00:56:47.78 fist shape chin and handsome smile that every man, woman and child in the country recognized,
00:56:47.78 --> 00:56:52.02 Tony was known, wait did I get that right, Tony, you're Tony, Tony, Tony, Tony,
00:56:52.02 --> 00:56:57.46 Tony was known as the great war machine turned heavyweight boxing champ who had not once but twice
00:56:57.46 --> 00:57:02.66 defeated Jack DMC. Unlike many boxes of his day who's training consisted of in the words of one
00:57:02.66 --> 00:57:07.54 competitor, a haircut and a shave, Tony had managed this feat by relentlessly conditioning
00:57:07.54 --> 00:57:12.66 his body during the day and by reading Shakespeare every night. After winning his second fight,
00:57:12.66 --> 00:57:18.66 Tony had fought only once more, then quit the ring forever to follow what, to follow that irresistible
00:57:18.66 --> 00:57:23.70 pull as one contemporary reported, no reporter noted to do something big in other fields.
00:57:25.06 --> 00:57:30.34 This had included lecturing on Richard III at Yale and inventing the gene,
00:57:30.34 --> 00:57:36.98 Tony, exercise or a long board equipment, a long board equipped with ropes and pullies that
00:57:36.98 --> 00:57:40.34 would raise the feet and condition the abdomen's it sold for $3.
00:57:44.58 --> 00:57:49.14 Biggest of all, he had swapped his old global anchor for the bronze oak leaves of a naval officer
00:57:49.14 --> 00:57:53.94 in order to rid his new service of what he considered its greatest threat, the pot belly.
00:57:53.94 --> 00:58:00.18 I dare say that 50% of the officers in listed men cannot properly stand at attention said
00:58:00.18 --> 00:58:05.06 the newly commissioned Tony in 1941, partly blaming their ill-fitting dungries, which stretched
00:58:05.06 --> 00:58:10.42 too much and induced the wearer to stick out his belly and hold them up. Tony reasoned that the
00:58:10.42 --> 00:58:16.02 problem was actually a threat to national security, then would eventually lead in his words to
00:58:16.02 --> 00:58:21.94 moral collapse. Believing like all Marines that a strong physique undergirded a strong character,
00:58:21.94 --> 00:58:27.22 Tony's initial efforts in the navy had met with only moderate success because sailors were
00:58:27.22 --> 00:58:32.26 not Marines and as such had never cared much for either fitness or character.
00:58:36.50 --> 00:58:41.06 Yeah, you're dry ho humid comes through a lot in this book. I had to cut. I don't know,
00:58:41.06 --> 00:58:48.58 probably five sex pages of Tony out. I mean, the one problem that you face when you're writing a
00:58:48.58 --> 00:58:54.58 book like this is that you research is really seductive. You can go down rabbit hole after rabbit hole.
00:58:54.58 --> 00:58:58.02 Keep going. You keep going. You find article after article after article and you want to
00:58:58.02 --> 00:59:04.58 you want to cram all this information into that into that paragraph and it doesn't take anywhere.
00:59:04.58 --> 00:59:09.06 So you constantly have to be asking yourself, what is this? First of all, what's the book?
00:59:09.06 --> 00:59:13.70 I kept a note card on my desk when I started working on the book and the note card had three
00:59:13.70 --> 00:59:19.30 questions on it. It was pinned to the wall. It said, what's the purpose of the book? What's the
00:59:19.30 --> 00:59:24.66 purpose of the chapter? What's the purpose of this paragraph? And if the paragraph is not in
00:59:24.66 --> 00:59:29.46 support of the chapter and if the chapter is not in support of the book, then you're not, you're
00:59:29.46 --> 00:59:37.62 doing it wrong. So, every character that you come across, you want to give them some sort of
00:59:37.62 --> 00:59:46.34 introduction. Tony's consequential and that he attracts all of these studs. Yeah, he brings all of these
00:59:46.34 --> 00:59:52.66 studs. But he doesn't have the program that's going to be able to contain these guys. So he
00:59:52.66 --> 01:00:00.98 attracts all of these, you know, pro football players to his program that they all want to, you know,
01:00:00.98 --> 01:00:05.70 serve their country, you know, in the most aggressive way possible and they find out that they're
01:00:05.70 --> 01:00:12.18 going to be calistening instructors. So of course, you know, what's going to happen. So Tony collects
01:00:12.18 --> 01:00:20.90 all these guys and then, you know, I think the, go ahead. Yeah, it's, it's, you know, I've done a lot of
01:00:20.90 --> 01:00:27.86 reading about sag and every, basically, I would say every sag mission in Vietnam could be its own book.
01:00:27.86 --> 01:00:32.90 And just want every single sag mission. And that's the feeling I get when, when reading your
01:00:32.90 --> 01:00:37.78 book, every one of these characters that you introduce could be their own book. Yeah, just about
01:00:37.78 --> 01:00:42.50 every single character could be their own book. You just have to stop. You've got to, you've got to
01:00:42.50 --> 01:00:47.70 draw the line at some point. You'd be like, yes, there's a book here clearly, but we're, you know,
01:00:47.70 --> 01:00:52.74 we're going on to, you know, the subject. I never wanted to write a book with a thesis. I was never
01:00:52.74 --> 01:00:57.14 my objective. I didn't want to prove anything. But what I did find was that with the thesis,
01:00:57.14 --> 01:01:02.90 with the thesis, I was able to connect all these disparate stories. Right. Never would have
01:01:02.90 --> 01:01:07.70 formed a, you know, a comprehensive story. Mm-hmm. But with that thesis, by asking the question,
01:01:08.58 --> 01:01:13.94 how did the Navy come to create a land focus going to a work of a, I was able to stitch all these
01:01:13.94 --> 01:01:18.90 other, you know, Rangers and Raiders and all the other stories of, you know, the non-seal units
01:01:18.90 --> 01:01:22.90 into a book about the seals. So here's another character that you introduce,
01:01:22.90 --> 01:01:30.10 um, that we all in the seal teams. No. When 28-year-old Phil Bucklew, a football star from
01:01:30.10 --> 01:01:34.26 Columbus, Ohio had presented himself at an Army recruitment office immediately after Pearl Harbor
01:01:34.26 --> 01:01:37.86 to volunteer for the pair of troopers. The recruiter had taken one look at his six foot two,
01:01:37.86 --> 01:01:43.46 235 pound frame and said, I could, I could take two instead of you, considering that the smallest
01:01:43.46 --> 01:01:48.82 soldier the army could accept was a shadow heavier than 105 pounds of recruiters absolutely right.
01:01:48.82 --> 01:01:53.38 Disappointed to be passed up for the pair of troopers and thus loses chance to be dropped into a
01:01:53.38 --> 01:01:59.06 foreign land, Bucklew had settled for the Navy. Then settled again for the, for the Tone program,
01:01:59.06 --> 01:02:05.54 ostensibly the best place in the military for someone with his background. After playing for Xavier
01:02:05.54 --> 01:02:10.34 University in Cincinnati and then the ramp for the Rams in Cleveland, Bucklew had since gone
01:02:10.34 --> 01:02:13.70 on to raise money and recruit players for his own professional football team,
01:02:13.70 --> 01:02:17.86 accomplishments that had demonstrated not only intelligence and toughness that Tone sought,
01:02:17.86 --> 01:02:23.14 but also leadership and the risk taking of an entrepreneur. He was not the only footballer with
01:02:23.14 --> 01:02:30.02 hidden potential. Big John Trips in a six foot five bushy-haired all-American from Mississippi State,
01:02:30.02 --> 01:02:34.26 had already seen more of the country than most Americans ever would, having traded his life
01:02:34.26 --> 01:02:39.62 on the South Texas planes to play all-protackle for the Detroit Lions and Robert Herrick,
01:02:39.62 --> 01:02:44.74 a mountain of muscle from the mountains of Colorado, who stacked every bit as high as his Texas
01:02:44.74 --> 01:02:50.34 colleague had enlisted in the Navy not only as a graduate of Colorado State, but as it's head football
01:02:50.34 --> 01:02:54.58 coach. Essentially he was a roster with more potential than Tone's program contained.
01:02:57.22 --> 01:03:01.06 It's just a bunch of freaking beasts. Got it, got to read this part too.
01:03:01.94 --> 01:03:08.02 So at the call for amphibious commandos, Bucklew and nine other tight-knath leads raise their hands
01:03:08.02 --> 01:03:11.70 when they reported to their next assignment, Achief Petty Officer with a knowledge of angling
01:03:11.70 --> 01:03:18.50 and the Toney regime took one look at the oversized arrivals and dubbed them the tuna fish.
01:03:21.06 --> 01:03:29.94 The name stuck. You get another guy named Halperon in here who plays a huge role in all this.
01:03:30.50 --> 01:03:41.22 Yeah, he's indispensable. I mean, everybody, you know, the temptation when you're writing about these
01:03:41.22 --> 01:03:45.86 guys is to introduce them as they come. You know, you come to Bucklew. You want to introduce Bucklew
01:03:45.86 --> 01:03:52.18 because Bucklew is one of the most important people in the history of NSW. You come to him.
01:03:52.18 --> 01:03:56.66 You want to give him a good, you want to give him him the introduction that he deserves, but he doesn't
01:03:56.66 --> 01:04:03.70 become, he doesn't become Phil Bucklew. The consequential Phil Bucklew until Vietnam. So you've got
01:04:03.70 --> 01:04:09.94 to hold your fire and you've got to, you know, sort of convince the reader that if you just hold on,
01:04:09.94 --> 01:04:15.22 we're going to get there. So because the most consequential person, person of this period,
01:04:15.22 --> 01:04:18.58 is the guy you just mentioned, is Bucklew. Yeah, you get this guy Bucklew,
01:04:18.58 --> 01:04:23.62 Pernet, a mere six feet, 225 pounds. Guess what monsters? This is back in the day, too. This is
01:04:23.62 --> 01:04:29.78 freaking, like World War II. Guys are not jacked. Like they are now. Well, if you're six foot
01:04:29.78 --> 01:04:36.34 six feet, 225 back in the day, you are jacked. 100%. Echo, can you confirm? From the
01:04:36.34 --> 01:04:43.14 bro science perspective. Okay. This may be true. At a mere six feet, 225 pounds, Robert Buck
01:04:43.14 --> 01:04:48.58 Halperon was easily the smallest of the group. But stood out from his fellow footballers for a
01:04:48.58 --> 01:04:54.42 string of peculiarities, not the least of which a face, not unlike that of Holly Woods, Robert Taylor.
01:04:54.42 --> 01:04:58.18 Besides this, he was half a decade older than the rest and had a personality that was not only
01:04:58.18 --> 01:05:04.42 his dry as Cabernet, but also incomparably unflappable. Most peculiar of all, he'd been raised and
01:05:04.42 --> 01:05:10.26 educated in the exclusive Chicago suburb of Oak Park, the second son of prominent Jewish immigrants
01:05:10.26 --> 01:05:14.90 at the time, not exactly features that encouraged friendships with working class white footballers,
01:05:14.90 --> 01:05:19.94 but trying telling that to Halperon. Unlike the son of Jewish immigrants, unlike many
01:05:19.94 --> 01:05:24.66 sons of Jewish immigrants, Halperon had been raised to speak no yetish to practice no faith. A boy
01:05:24.66 --> 01:05:30.18 so adrift from any spiritual anchor that he adopted two regional substitutes as his sanctuaries.
01:05:30.18 --> 01:05:34.18 The first had been Lake Michigan in which he swam so often and so well that he once
01:05:34.18 --> 01:05:39.70 caught the admiration of awaiting Al Capone. And upon which he had learned to sail, eventually
01:05:39.70 --> 01:05:44.90 reading the Wendy city's win so well that he had taken up competitive racing. The other sanctuary,
01:05:44.90 --> 01:05:50.58 a high, holy place if there ever was one had been the Notre Dame football stadium.
01:05:50.58 --> 01:05:56.74 Asked why a Jew would submit himself to such a Christian university, Halperon had flatly replied
01:05:56.74 --> 01:06:06.18 because it was the best. So this is another guy. Yeah, he just a character.
01:06:06.18 --> 01:06:11.62 And he starts, I mean he starts from nothing. He doesn't, he has no expectation. He's so old
01:06:11.62 --> 01:06:17.54 when World War II starts. He's 34 years old when he enlists his assignment in the Navy.
01:06:18.26 --> 01:06:26.10 But his brother had been a radiologist at Pearl Harbor. And so after you're seeing your brother,
01:06:26.10 --> 01:06:30.98 you know, performing such service, what else you know, you've got to do the same. So he
01:06:31.54 --> 01:06:37.14 pulls every string and can get himself into the Navy. And I don't know. I don't want to
01:06:39.38 --> 01:06:45.38 give anything away, but he, I mean he goes from the Tony program all the way to China. I mean he
01:06:45.38 --> 01:06:50.18 becomes NSW's first ground force commander. It's friggin nuts.
01:06:50.18 --> 01:06:59.86 Um, last week of 1942, Buck Halperon in the rest of the tuna fish, plus 36 enlisted sailors left
01:06:59.86 --> 01:07:04.90 the Solomon Islands where they were trucked more than 100 miles to a point where the lower lip
01:07:04.90 --> 01:07:09.22 of the Chesapeake Bay met the Atlantic Ocean. Here, the Virginia Coast gave way to an isolated
01:07:09.22 --> 01:07:14.26 tidewater inlet called Little Creek and a dirt road based with dirt floor housing that made the
01:07:14.26 --> 01:07:20.34 Solomon's look like San Francisco upon arrival they were greeted by an army officer. Lieutenant
01:07:20.34 --> 01:07:26.34 Lloyd Petticoord Jr. 29 year old former commander of the observer group who now wore knee-high
01:07:26.34 --> 01:07:31.30 leather boots of a horse soldier and in spite of a small stature when standing at attention
01:07:31.30 --> 01:07:37.54 look like a nail waiting to be driven into a rail tie. His personality wasn't far off as one of
01:07:37.54 --> 01:07:41.14 the few soldiers who had participated in Marine Corps Flex exercises, he knew all two other
01:07:41.14 --> 01:07:46.26 challenges awaiting the men. He now welcomed to the intensely difficult course he had just created
01:07:46.26 --> 01:07:52.50 a course of soft sand runs rubber boat races and endless team calisthenics known as the
01:07:52.50 --> 01:07:58.74 joint army navy amphibious scouts in radar school at last the navy's volunteers for amphibious
01:07:58.74 --> 01:08:05.70 commandos were about to come them. That's sort of the beginning and there's something you know
01:08:05.70 --> 01:08:12.34 what's interesting I don't know I'm thinking if you do those like psychological games where
01:08:12.34 --> 01:08:16.98 or psychological tests where somebody says something and it makes you think of whatever you
01:08:16.98 --> 01:08:22.02 know you have to say what it means but when you hear amphibious commando who's not 100% in all
01:08:22.02 --> 01:08:28.98 that way. Like when I think I knew it at amphibious commando is when I was five years old and wanted
01:08:28.98 --> 01:08:39.46 in you know. I had I collected these little air fix soldiers the little one 30 second size
01:08:39.46 --> 01:08:43.14 little army men when I was a kid my mom eventually threw them all the way by the way
01:08:43.14 --> 01:08:50.74 just a savage I had a hundred of them and I used to you know dream and talk and play with those
01:08:50.74 --> 01:08:55.78 things but my favorite was the British commandos the Adli LaZodiacs and and kayaks and little
01:08:55.78 --> 01:09:01.54 a beany caps like that was the deal and you see that was when I was a little kid that was like
01:09:01.54 --> 01:09:12.82 a hair amphibious commandos. So again I can't read so much I know but yeah a pedicure like he's
01:09:12.82 --> 01:09:28.90 a each of the people that I focus on in the book. I tried to drill down as close as I could you know
01:09:28.90 --> 01:09:33.94 there's you know the general of thumb as you start big and you go small so you read whatever
01:09:33.94 --> 01:09:39.22 is available you the existing literature that's out there and there have been there have been a
01:09:39.22 --> 01:09:43.38 couple of books that have been published in pedicure it's a character so you kind of trace those down
01:09:43.94 --> 01:09:48.10 you know pedicure it out from buckley whatever you're trying to get as close you can to
01:09:48.66 --> 01:09:53.06 the person that you want to write about or the the person that becomes the consequential person
01:09:53.06 --> 01:09:58.58 of the moment so you're trying to learn about them and such a way that you can find out the
01:09:58.58 --> 01:10:05.70 traits in that person that made them consequential and whether the traits that made you know somebody
01:10:05.70 --> 01:10:12.98 like Carlson, a failure or the traits that made pedicure to buckler or hauntburn success so oftentimes
01:10:12.98 --> 01:10:18.26 you'd hit a wall there's no place you know there's no more information that's available
01:10:18.26 --> 01:10:23.94 and existing literature so you've got to start digging into you know archival material so I had
01:10:23.94 --> 01:10:29.54 learned pretty quickly you know what archives around the country usually had the most stuff so I
01:10:29.54 --> 01:10:34.26 would go to those archives and I would dig. But where does this place you got to go to like yeah so
01:10:34.26 --> 01:10:39.14 the libraries or something yeah so the archive that I generally used about five different archives
01:10:39.70 --> 01:10:45.70 the most the best one was probably the National Archives in Maryland they
01:10:48.42 --> 01:10:55.78 they have the most stuff and they have the it's accessible when you start getting to the military
01:10:55.78 --> 01:11:00.82 archives that that the army so much the army archives is actually really a world class institution
01:11:00.82 --> 01:11:07.38 I loved going there that's in Carl and the Marine Corps archive in Quantico another another great
01:11:07.38 --> 01:11:15.22 archive the Navy yard it or the naval heritage and history command our archive at the Navy yard
01:11:15.22 --> 01:11:22.34 that was a bit trickier they had for whatever reason I think a lot of it had to do with the fact
01:11:22.34 --> 01:11:27.30 that they had a active shooter there a few years before so security on the on the base was tight
01:11:27.30 --> 01:11:32.50 but they would really so very close held institutions so when you went there you know digging
01:11:32.50 --> 01:11:38.66 through their stuff could be a little complicated you had to plan around it but you'd find stuff you'd
01:11:38.66 --> 01:11:45.06 find you know I found letters the pedic ordered written you've got to really you've got to look
01:11:45.06 --> 01:11:49.14 at the letter you've got to read it once you know highlight what's important and you've got to read it
01:11:49.14 --> 01:11:54.98 again and again and figure out you know what you can learn about him from the letter at the way
01:11:54.98 --> 01:12:00.34 talks the way it writes the way he thinks when you run into that when you can't you know squeeze
01:12:00.34 --> 01:12:08.10 any more information out of that then you're left with find in the family and you know in this
01:12:08.10 --> 01:12:13.30 case I found pedic words family I tried to find you know at least a family member for every you
01:12:13.30 --> 01:12:21.30 know person that I you know focused on on the book had dinner with buck Alprens son last night
01:12:21.30 --> 01:12:26.90 still close friends with him but pedicors family you know some of these people they don't
01:12:26.90 --> 01:12:34.26 realize like how important their dad or their grandfather was in the history and they have no idea
01:12:34.26 --> 01:12:40.10 why you're calling them and they you know that you know they they would provide photos they provide
01:12:40.10 --> 01:12:43.30 letters sometimes they would let you come to their house and dig through their stuff
01:12:43.30 --> 01:12:53.30 um yeah pedicord was one of those that I didn't expect to find as much as I did but talking to
01:12:53.30 --> 01:12:58.26 them I mean you can get little details I don't my fun one photo of pedicord wearing those boots
01:13:00.58 --> 01:13:06.58 and I knew that they were you know the boots that army cavalry soldiers wore
01:13:07.94 --> 01:13:12.66 and I didn't anticipate that they were boots that he wore you know through the rest of his career
01:13:12.66 --> 01:13:19.22 until I ran into an old scout and raider I was a 96-year-old guy old Jim Barnes what they call them
01:13:20.02 --> 01:13:24.74 I was like you know I'd sat down to interview Jim Barnes and I you know what do you remember about
01:13:24.74 --> 01:13:28.34 pedicord and the first thing that he remembered were those boots
01:13:30.98 --> 01:13:32.26 yeah little details
01:13:35.54 --> 01:13:41.14 after this here you you detail you go through some of the details of operation towards which is
01:13:41.14 --> 01:13:50.34 up in North Africa the Sabu River it's it's success you know it's a tough operation
01:13:53.22 --> 01:13:59.38 five of the 10 original tuna fish get the navy cross from that operation and again I'm skipping
01:13:59.38 --> 01:14:04.02 through some of that right now get the book get the book and read about that freaking operation because it's epic
01:14:04.02 --> 01:14:13.78 um the origination you know we've said this a couple times but the origination of everything that
01:14:13.78 --> 01:14:21.22 goes on here is is you you have to tell talk about the raiders you have to talk about the rangers you
01:14:21.22 --> 01:14:27.78 have to talk about why why why what happened to them and why they didn't become seals
01:14:28.50 --> 01:14:33.94 or at least this seal type thing this is a section here where you start talking
01:14:33.94 --> 01:14:40.90 about um well the rangers so the premise is you know that the navy should never have had this capability
01:14:42.50 --> 01:14:47.30 when I started trying to come up with a title for the book I warn the my options for sub-pitals
01:14:47.30 --> 01:14:51.70 were like something like the origin story the navy seals at unit that should not exist something
01:14:51.70 --> 01:14:56.18 like that something is you know provocative like like that and the reason they shouldn't exist
01:14:57.38 --> 01:15:01.86 is because of the army and the marine queen the industry I all of these institutions were
01:15:01.86 --> 01:15:08.98 better suited for this mission than the navy was uh so in order to you know explain the
01:15:08.98 --> 01:15:13.70 question that I you know ask at the beginning how the navy you know come to field this you know land
01:15:13.70 --> 01:15:19.70 focus go anywhere commando for us um the way that's phrased is you have to understand why these
01:15:19.70 --> 01:15:24.90 other institutions didn't uh become that first why they didn't block the navy from becoming that
01:15:24.90 --> 01:15:28.98 and only in understanding why they didn't become that can you understand really understand why
01:15:28.98 --> 01:15:36.34 the navy did it why the navy felt like it had to do it that includes the rangers going to the book
01:15:36.34 --> 01:15:42.50 the officer selected to command the rangers 31 year old major William Orlando Derby born in
01:15:42.50 --> 01:15:50.34 Fort Smith our can saw in 1911 the same guerrilla studded year as Lord Lovat and Russell Volkman
01:15:51.06 --> 01:15:54.82 Derby grew up believing that he was destined for greatness of average size and looks as
01:15:54.82 --> 01:16:00.58 greatness laid below the surface as it as it is so often with tragic men a war would be to
01:16:00.58 --> 01:16:06.10 require to uncover it black hair blue eyed wide mouth as a duck Derby had a ruddy face divided
01:16:06.10 --> 01:16:14.42 into equal parts forehead and chin his left cheek borham mysterious brilliant red scar not particularly
01:16:14.42 --> 01:16:20.02 muscular he nevertheless affected chest out shoulders back posture in which his arms seemed
01:16:20.02 --> 01:16:25.06 to always cock to the rear as if never more than a moment away from snapping to attention son of a
01:16:25.06 --> 01:16:30.42 printer and a musician the second child between two sisters he grew up scouting the Arkansas
01:16:30.42 --> 01:16:37.22 woods and playing the saxophone while in high school his older sister died in Texas he
01:16:37.22 --> 01:16:42.02 married then divorced in spite of disappointment and tragedy his attitude remained as it ever
01:16:42.02 --> 01:16:47.62 had been good humored and irrepressible in personality just like his posture he was direct
01:16:47.62 --> 01:16:54.42 forceful and never vacillating had the military gnaut dominated and given and driven him to a life
01:16:54.42 --> 01:17:01.62 of soldiering he would have made a born salesman he is the ideal commando leader wrote Colonel Vaughn
01:17:01.62 --> 01:17:06.50 at the end of the course he possesses the energy keenness and personality which produces the best
01:17:06.50 --> 01:17:11.70 out of those under his command graduated from west point in 1933 at the apex of the bell curve
01:17:11.70 --> 01:17:18.90 ranked 177 out of 346 he was originally assigned as a field artillery officer fast forward a
01:17:18.90 --> 01:17:24.50 little bit if the ideal army officer was equal parts confidence bravery energy and obedience
01:17:25.62 --> 01:17:31.38 Darby was all these things but perhaps too much the last more than anything he believed his men
01:17:31.38 --> 01:17:36.34 could and should perform any mission assigned to them from the most audacious lightning raids to the
01:17:36.34 --> 01:17:43.78 most ignominious re-rational on duties to the most spectacular seized season hold operations
01:17:43.78 --> 01:17:48.02 because of this no one would be more responsible for proving the value of the Rangers
01:17:49.38 --> 01:17:58.98 or for their downfall so you go into talking about their first experience the Rangers first
01:17:58.98 --> 01:18:08.34 combat experience who choose in deep yeah yep yeah that's I think I say France 1942 yeah and that
01:18:09.46 --> 01:18:16.42 that that one sentence that I give depth that represents 20 pages of book that I had to cut out
01:18:16.42 --> 01:18:22.90 like I spent like I said the research is really seductive I mean you find something that is so
01:18:22.90 --> 01:18:30.10 you know what you think is meaningful or what you think you know sort of shows you the direction
01:18:30.10 --> 01:18:35.86 that this whole thing is going in you I mean the temptation is to really really focus on it
01:18:35.86 --> 01:18:42.34 and drag your reader through this but you have to remember that you know you're trying to
01:18:42.34 --> 01:18:46.90 get the reader someplace and you don't want a frontload of chapter with 20 pages of battle
01:18:46.90 --> 01:18:50.98 and introduce characters in this battle or of this battle they're really not going to take
01:18:50.98 --> 01:18:57.46 anywhere they're also epic speaking of British commandos jockels perhaps inspiration
01:18:57.46 --> 01:19:01.86 for being a commando himself you got this quarter I'm just gonna read one quote this is what the
01:19:01.86 --> 01:19:08.02 Ranger said about the about the commandos that they went into gap with my god those commandos
01:19:08.02 --> 01:19:11.94 can fight remember one Ranger after the battle they'd kneeled down or lie down and fire
01:19:11.94 --> 01:19:16.50 then stand up grab an apple off a tree and start firing again freaking brits
01:19:16.50 --> 01:19:22.66 um so you go through that raid you go through another raid was even more dramatic victim of a
01:19:22.66 --> 01:19:26.82 winch that broke while lowering his landing craft dumping him as radios and equipment back into the
01:19:26.82 --> 01:19:32.10 ocean darby nevertheless scrambled back apart as boat then led four companies plus one chaplain
01:19:32.10 --> 01:19:37.54 ashore their despite squelching wet boots he and his Rangers marched uphill for three miles every
01:19:37.54 --> 01:19:42.10 man carrying a full loadout of ammunition plus fighting knives band that's climbing ropes one stick
01:19:42.10 --> 01:19:48.74 a dynamite and two mortar rounds the two unluckiest also pushed a muel cart bulging with still more
01:19:48.74 --> 01:19:54.02 mortar rounds when the Rangers arrived at fort denored they found it was surrounded by concentric
01:19:54.02 --> 01:19:59.62 search circles of barbed wires high as eight feet in his deepest 14 with every snip each man's
01:19:59.62 --> 01:20:04.74 nerves nerves since tighter just as they were about to reach the last ring a machine gun
01:20:04.74 --> 01:20:10.26 barked and drove them to the ground darby every the artillery man wasted no time really pull up
01:20:10.26 --> 01:20:15.54 your pull your company back a few yards then hit him when the barrage stops we tenip Murray had got
01:20:15.54 --> 01:20:20.42 had hardly got his men untangled from the wire when the first rounds bumped into the battlements
01:20:20.42 --> 01:20:25.86 thus persuaded the French defenders abandoned their machine guns and retreated chased by Murray
01:20:25.86 --> 01:20:34.82 and his Rangers shouting high-ho silver away that's fighting against the um the French the
01:20:34.82 --> 01:20:43.94 Vici French yeah fast forward a little we got had not I mean the when you read that and when you
01:20:43.94 --> 01:20:49.14 when you think about the Rangers it just reinforces everything I said before the seals should not
01:20:49.14 --> 01:20:55.38 exist yeah when you have you know what is clearly a naval commando force go anywhere commando force
01:20:56.18 --> 01:21:03.14 as capable as the Rangers were in 1942 this is a capability the army had they created it they were
01:21:03.14 --> 01:21:08.90 smart enough to create it and then they lost sight of the reasons that they created it and
01:21:08.90 --> 01:21:14.50 are actually the lose side of the reasons the the reasons that they created it are the reason
01:21:14.50 --> 01:21:19.06 that they had the downfall they didn't care about you know the Rangers commando capability there
01:21:19.06 --> 01:21:25.30 were more preoccupied with using the Rangers as a way to teach the rest of the army how to fight
01:21:25.30 --> 01:21:30.98 we want to integrate our Rangers with British commandos because the British commandos are really
01:21:30.98 --> 01:21:36.42 the only English speaking troops on the planet that knew how to fight they wanted to you know
01:21:36.42 --> 01:21:41.22 George Marshall wants to take that experience and pass it along to the rest of the US infantry
01:21:41.22 --> 01:21:49.62 or the army infantry and so by the time that the infantry starts to you know elevate itself to
01:21:49.62 --> 01:21:56.18 the the capabilities of the Rangers then divisional commander start using the Rangers more is not
01:21:56.18 --> 01:22:02.90 uh commandos to go you know radar uh on artillery position or command post they just start pushing
01:22:02.90 --> 01:22:08.82 them ahead of the infantry uh the homeless sort of like suicidal spearheaders and when you know
01:22:08.82 --> 01:22:16.18 the chapter ends I mean it's it's just it's so depressing but so predictable
01:22:16.18 --> 01:22:29.22 let's get there this is a massive mission this is in uh sister and uh you go through
01:22:29.22 --> 01:22:33.54 I mean I'm gonna I'm gonna catch the last little bit of it you go through the battle you go through
01:22:33.54 --> 01:22:37.70 it unfolds I mean there's so many leadership lessons to learn in here obviously it's all about
01:22:37.70 --> 01:22:43.30 leadership all the time but not a leadership lessons that are in this book is incredible um
01:22:43.30 --> 01:22:50.26 kind of wrapping this up since he'd been blown off the top of a smoking tank dobson
01:22:50.26 --> 01:22:56.74 had somehow made it back to his men near the calica pre-calica pre-neigh house there while
01:22:56.74 --> 01:23:00.90 organizing another defensive perimeter he had taken more shrapnel is right throughout thigh
01:23:00.90 --> 01:23:05.94 now lying in a ditch next to a burning self-propelled gun whose artillery rounds continue to
01:23:05.94 --> 01:23:11.14 cook off around him he passed his command to captain Charles Shunstrom a Ranger
01:23:11.14 --> 01:23:19.86 since the aconnary days and Darby's tank killing comparison and Darby's tank killing companion
01:23:19.86 --> 01:23:26.34 at gala upon taking command Shunstrom unaggressive as aggressive a soldier as the
01:23:26.34 --> 01:23:31.46 US Army had ever produced short-up his position with several companies of the third battalion
01:23:31.46 --> 01:23:36.26 and even attempted a flanking movement to either break free of the encirclement or believe
01:23:36.26 --> 01:23:44.58 you're not take the town none of it worked at 1045 solid communications were finally established
01:23:44.58 --> 01:23:49.70 between Darby and Shunstrom's radio the care of which was now in the hands of captain
01:23:49.70 --> 01:23:56.10 Edward Kitchens kitsch to everyone who knew him who was set up in the first battalions make
01:23:56.10 --> 01:24:01.14 shift aid station and whose feet were gradually becoming more and more encumbered by wounded
01:24:01.14 --> 01:24:09.06 Rangers at 1115 Darby told kitsch to hold on and that the fourth battalion was making slow
01:24:09.06 --> 01:24:15.78 but steady progress 30 minutes later Darby re-edited his encouragement and even asked kitsch
01:24:15.78 --> 01:24:21.30 to put together a rescue party for third divisions reconnaissance company that reportedly
01:24:21.30 --> 01:24:26.58 had been captured in his vicinity maybe you can break up the thing and rescue them
01:24:26.58 --> 01:24:30.98 Darby said his suggestion is tone deaf as his original expectations.
01:24:32.50 --> 01:24:37.06 Operationally employed like infantry Darby's Rangers were now dying like them too.
01:24:38.82 --> 01:24:46.18 At the Calacarini House alone lay some 16 dead Rangers another 22 wounded and only five men
01:24:46.18 --> 01:24:56.26 still fighting barely three loaded weapons among them. That 1215 kitsch became so overwatt, overwrought
01:24:56.26 --> 01:25:03.46 and weeping that he could no longer make himself understood. Darby asked for another voice
01:25:03.46 --> 01:25:08.58 and kitsch quit the household together preferring to die outside in battle rather than
01:25:08.58 --> 01:25:16.10 trapped inside manning the radio. Grasping the receiver now was a hulking Ranger
01:25:16.10 --> 01:25:20.90 Master Sergeant Robert E. Holt from Brooklyn, New York one of Darby's originals.
01:25:20.90 --> 01:25:27.54 Some of the fellows are giving up Colonel said E. Holt his voice scratching out of the
01:25:27.54 --> 01:25:33.30 speaker box. We're awfully sorry they can't help it because we're running out of ammunition
01:25:34.26 --> 01:25:40.42 but I ain't surrendering and his farmhouse command post Darby became frantic.
01:25:41.22 --> 01:25:45.86 Don't let the boys give up he pleaded get the old men together and land for it.
01:25:45.86 --> 01:25:52.42 How many men are still with you? They're coming into the building now E. Holt replied gunfire
01:25:52.42 --> 01:25:57.54 snapping in the background we're out of ammo but they won't get us cheap so long Colonel
01:25:57.54 --> 01:26:05.46 maybe when it's all over I'll see you again. With a violent wham wham E. Holt's transmission
01:26:05.46 --> 01:26:14.74 cut out. Darby squeezed the handset and studied himself. Use your head and do what is best.
01:26:14.74 --> 01:26:17.86 You're there and I'm here unfortunately I can't help you.
01:26:20.18 --> 01:26:24.90 It's stung to say the words into the dead line his fourth battalion still a mile from
01:26:24.90 --> 01:26:30.50 Cisterna. But whatever happens God bless you God bless all of you.
01:26:33.14 --> 01:26:36.82 With the mention of God Darby's voice choked his eyes watered.
01:26:36.82 --> 01:26:42.90 E. Holt, I leave everything in your hands tell the men I am with them to the end.
01:26:46.58 --> 01:26:52.18 After a moment he set down the handset, bracing himself he wrapped his hands around a telephone
01:26:52.18 --> 01:26:58.74 receiver and called general trust Scott. It apparently was too much for them he said muffling
01:26:58.74 --> 01:27:03.86 his emotions replacing the receiver in its cradle. Darby asked his staff to leave the room.
01:27:03.86 --> 01:27:11.22 As enemy shells beat a steady tattoo around the house he crumpled into a chair, dropped his head
01:27:11.22 --> 01:27:21.22 into his arms and sobbed. Several minutes later Darby appeared outside his shoulders straight
01:27:21.22 --> 01:27:29.62 and his chin thrust forward defiantly. He was still in command but in command of what?
01:27:29.62 --> 01:27:42.26 No one quite knew. I hate hearing that. This whole episode is based off a couple of sources.
01:27:42.26 --> 01:27:46.50 One of them being shunned. Shunstrums report that he wrote. I want to say three days
01:27:46.50 --> 01:27:50.58 that after the battle after surviving this thing he was one of the few that escapes
01:27:51.62 --> 01:27:56.26 and on a series of and on the radio transcription that they were keeping.
01:27:56.26 --> 01:28:05.94 Darby's headquarters. You can actually see everything that was said on that radio and you can read it
01:28:06.74 --> 01:28:16.82 and it's horrible. You know going into it where is going to happen and where
01:28:16.82 --> 01:28:31.14 it doesn't make it easier though. So despite these legendary heroics like you said,
01:28:31.14 --> 01:28:37.62 I mean the heroics of the troops are just undeniable just after World War II all six army range of
01:28:37.62 --> 01:28:45.78 Italians or Dispanthe. You say here, superficially modeled on Churchill's butcher and bolt commandos,
01:28:45.78 --> 01:28:51.46 the US Army Rangers by the time of their disbandment, look nothing like them. This was in the end
01:28:51.46 --> 01:28:57.70 the predictable result of different parents preoccupied with the readiness of his frontline soldiers.
01:28:57.70 --> 01:29:02.42 George Marshall had created the Rangers not to perfect the art of Churchill's coastal raids,
01:29:02.42 --> 01:29:06.74 but to serve his infantry. First by gaining battlefield experience that could be
01:29:06.74 --> 01:29:10.90 transferred to the rest of his troops second by handing them off to infantry commanders who
01:29:10.90 --> 01:29:15.46 committed the Rangers to missions within possible odds and then either blame them for their failures
01:29:15.46 --> 01:29:19.30 or diminish their uniqueness by using them no differently than regular infantry.
01:29:21.22 --> 01:29:26.34 Though no one could have guessed the consequences it was a prioritization that produced a
01:29:26.34 --> 01:29:31.94 lasting gap in the US military's order of battle for a unit that specialized in rating.
01:29:31.94 --> 01:29:38.02 One that could best be filled by a branch of service, less preoccupied, less preoccupied with
01:29:38.02 --> 01:29:42.82 this infantry and there was only one branch that didn't have infantry.
01:29:45.38 --> 01:29:51.54 So there you are setting up that one branch that doesn't have any infantry.
01:29:51.54 --> 01:29:55.38 Yeah at the time, there's only three branches. The Air Force doesn't exist yet, it's the army
01:29:55.38 --> 01:30:04.26 Air Corps. So of all three the army navy and the Marine Corps, navy's it. And you can see where this
01:30:04.26 --> 01:30:09.86 is going before you even get out of World War II. You can see the cycle that's going to
01:30:09.86 --> 01:30:17.78 continue all the way until Vietnam commanders are going to identify a gap. They're going to
01:30:17.78 --> 01:30:23.06 create commandos to fill that gap. They're going to commit them to action often to disastrous
01:30:23.06 --> 01:30:27.46 results and then they're going to renegade on their idea. They're going to pull the rug out from
01:30:27.46 --> 01:30:31.70 under these guys and every gap, every time that happens, it's often going to leave.
01:30:32.90 --> 01:30:38.42 They're that units commando partners in the lurch and always that commando partner is the US navy.
01:30:39.38 --> 01:30:43.22 And the navy's just going to get more frustrated, more frustrated, and they're going to continue
01:30:43.22 --> 01:30:46.98 pushing their units, their special units into that gap.
01:30:46.98 --> 01:30:55.78 Yeah, the next part of the book is called the opportunity chapter four, subtitled
01:30:55.78 --> 01:31:00.90 Draper Kaufman and the course that cracked the Atlantic wall then laid the first bricks of the
01:31:00.90 --> 01:31:02.82 legend of Naval Special Warfare.
01:31:08.34 --> 01:31:09.70 Here we go. These are weird.
01:31:09.70 --> 01:31:16.42 It's all in thin, lanky, even with dark hair, a narrow face and a chin that stretched down
01:31:16.42 --> 01:31:21.94 like a tear drop Draper Lawrence Kaufman also possessed poor teeth and spectacles as thick as
01:31:21.94 --> 01:31:28.66 sunmarine glass. Given to bouts of indolence, he was absent-minded of failure in any subject that
01:31:28.66 --> 01:31:34.34 not captures interest and alarmingly progressive on the issue of race, at least so fought his mother
01:31:34.34 --> 01:31:40.58 a shrew on the topic. As a young man, Kaufman had wanted nothing more than to attend the
01:31:40.58 --> 01:31:45.78 Naval Academy and commanded destroyer as his father had. When poor eyesight threatened to torpedo
01:31:45.78 --> 01:31:51.62 his dream, he submitted himself to the doctor's orders, however, medieval, and for one hour a day
01:31:51.62 --> 01:31:58.42 held a palm over each open eye. This, when his appointing congressman suddenly died, leaving
01:31:58.42 --> 01:32:02.98 his academy application in limbo, he told no one of his planned escape from his Connecticut
01:32:02.98 --> 01:32:08.02 boarding school got a bunk at the Washington DC YMCA and then walked the halls of Congress,
01:32:08.02 --> 01:32:12.98 slipping past secretaries and performing a rehearse sob story until someone anyone gave him an
01:32:12.98 --> 01:32:20.10 appointment. Once finally accepted, he rode crew, acted in school dramas and in cool for shadowing
01:32:20.10 --> 01:32:26.18 spent 30 days on a prison ship for sneaking off campus. When he graduated in 1933, a year
01:32:26.18 --> 01:32:31.06 when Navy Pinchers stalked the ranks looking for any excess ballast to pitch over the side,
01:32:31.06 --> 01:32:35.70 he was given his diploma and a physical disqualification from the Navy a steep four-year price
01:32:35.70 --> 01:32:41.46 to pay for to achieve the rank of civilian. Thus portrayed as child who dreamed Kaufman
01:32:41.46 --> 01:32:46.66 packed his pride, shelved any ideas of glory and settled for an onshore operation's job in
01:32:46.66 --> 01:32:51.94 the shipping industry, his life suddenly devoted to endless manifests for onloading and offloading
01:32:51.94 --> 01:32:59.38 of cargo. So there's your introduction to Draper Kaufman. I mean, just so many characters
01:32:59.38 --> 01:33:03.06 and this guy's definitely one of them gets put on a six-month assignment to Europe,
01:33:03.06 --> 01:33:07.46 while he's doing that that shipping job. While he's in Germany, he witnesses
01:33:07.46 --> 01:33:13.38 ain't all Hitler giving speeches, he realizes that this guy's what he realizes what's coming.
01:33:13.38 --> 01:33:19.54 Yeah. So fast forward a little bit, he decides he wants to go and
01:33:19.54 --> 01:33:24.34 serve in the American volunteer ambulance corps. To be accepted in the American volunteer
01:33:24.34 --> 01:33:28.98 ambulance corps, us adjunct unit of the French Army, one was first required to submit a
01:33:28.98 --> 01:33:34.90 downpane of $3,500 to cover living expenses in the cost of one ambulance. In 1940, that was
01:33:34.90 --> 01:33:39.14 almost the price of a house. Even more than alarming volunteers were bound to follow orders
01:33:39.14 --> 01:33:44.74 of French military to a man with purpose in his boots and adventure in his guts, just the sort
01:33:44.74 --> 01:33:50.66 of Hemingway. Hemingway is the French cause had attracted in the last war, no price was too high.
01:33:51.62 --> 01:33:56.82 And you say, actually it was too high. That was a big borrow and steel to get this money.
01:33:56.82 --> 01:34:01.38 Imagine you have to come up with the price of a house to go and serve in a freaking ambulance
01:34:01.38 --> 01:34:05.38 corps where you're going to get bombed a bone up, working for the French.
01:34:05.38 --> 01:34:10.82 Yeah. I mean, we all know the, you know, Draper Kaufman's sort of biography. I mean,
01:34:10.82 --> 01:34:14.98 every not everybody, but we get, you know, if you go to Buds, you're going to get the
01:34:14.98 --> 01:34:18.90 the Buds history class or the the steel history class. At some point, somebody going to
01:34:18.90 --> 01:34:21.86 mention Draper Kaufman. There was no, there was no Buds history class, there was no
01:34:21.86 --> 01:34:26.90 steel history class when I went through Buds. Do you say it? I'm saying there wasn't. I mean,
01:34:26.90 --> 01:34:32.50 it was 1990. So yeah, I know. And that's just going to make me mad if we talk about it.
01:34:32.50 --> 01:34:37.06 Yeah. No, but if you come across any sort of, any history book that's been written,
01:34:37.06 --> 01:34:41.70 Draper Kaufman's a character. And they're going to hit, you know, like I said,
01:34:41.70 --> 01:34:47.70 they're going to hit the wave tops of his biography. You know, before he becomes, you know, the,
01:34:47.70 --> 01:34:56.98 the indispensable character in the, in the UDTs, central Pacific campaigns. What they're not
01:34:56.98 --> 01:35:03.06 going to do is they're not going to put that biography in context. And when you really dig into it,
01:35:03.06 --> 01:35:08.82 like, you know, yes, we know he was an ambulance driver on the Western Front in 1940. We don't know
01:35:08.82 --> 01:35:15.94 what sacrifice it actually cost him to put himself in that position. And the reality is so much more,
01:35:15.94 --> 01:35:21.54 like me, I mean, you're right. I mean, he, you know, he, you know, he, you know,
01:35:21.54 --> 01:35:25.86 cached in everything he had, you know, to go do something that he believed in. Like how many people
01:35:25.86 --> 01:35:30.90 do you know, I don't know anybody like that today that would, you know, take away your house.
01:35:30.90 --> 01:35:35.54 Yeah, like, and it was all because he was just trying to, um,
01:35:36.66 --> 01:35:40.34 trying to do what he thought was right. He was trying to, you know, surface country, even though his
01:35:40.34 --> 01:35:46.66 country wouldn't take him at the time because he couldn't see anything. It's just, you know,
01:35:46.66 --> 01:35:52.82 you know, every character in this book, they have, you know, everybody wants to do something in the book,
01:35:54.02 --> 01:35:59.86 and most of them don't get to do the thing that they want. But all of us, we don't know,
01:35:59.86 --> 01:36:06.66 you know, what legacy we're going to have. And we don't know, like, what thing that we don't want
01:36:06.66 --> 01:36:10.98 to do that we have to do is going to be the most important part of our lives. And that's what happens
01:36:10.98 --> 01:36:14.66 with rape or coffman. He doesn't want to do any of this. It doesn't want to be an ambulance driver.
01:36:14.66 --> 01:36:19.30 He doesn't want to be a bomb disposal guy in the blitz. He wants to be a naval officer. He wants to be
01:36:19.30 --> 01:36:24.02 on a destroyer. They won't let him. So he does all these other things to try and live up to what his
01:36:24.02 --> 01:36:32.34 dad has done. And he ends up being, you know, he becomes a legend because of it. So just to dive into a
01:36:32.34 --> 01:36:39.54 little bit of coffman, what he did on May 10, 1940, coffman arrived at his post six miles beyond
01:36:40.18 --> 01:36:46.90 the protection of the magna forts in the Saur River Valley in the northeast shoulder, France, where
01:36:46.90 --> 01:36:52.02 where the borders come to a point and jump like a salient into the ravenous mouth of Germany.
01:36:52.66 --> 01:37:00.58 The same day Hitler launched 100 divisions through the Rden's force. As he, as he had known
01:37:00.58 --> 01:37:07.62 it would, the Second World War, had begun. And again, for two unrelenting weeks,
01:37:07.62 --> 01:37:11.94 Draper drove to the front picked up survivors and returned the inside of his ambulance slippery
01:37:11.94 --> 01:37:17.06 with blood. The whole while he sustained himself on bits of food and the horror of French cigarettes.
01:37:17.70 --> 01:37:23.38 The only sleep to be had was taken in snatches never in a bed and never with his boots off.
01:37:23.38 --> 01:37:29.22 Responding to the deliberate fire of German magunners, Bosch Barbarians, he called them.
01:37:29.22 --> 01:37:33.94 He and his fellow ambulance drivers began draping dark blankets over the side of their vehicles
01:37:33.94 --> 01:37:38.90 to cover the giant red cross emblems. By the end of his third week in combat,
01:37:38.90 --> 01:37:42.58 two ambulances had been shot out from under him and he had lost 10 pounds.
01:37:44.42 --> 01:37:47.62 This is what he gave his house worth of money to go do.
01:37:48.82 --> 01:37:53.70 On the afternoon of September 7, 1940, a thousand German planes attack London's and surrounding
01:37:53.70 --> 01:37:58.74 areas killing 400 men, women and children and wounding 1200 more. The next day, 412
01:37:58.74 --> 01:38:02.82 were killed, wounding nearly double that number. For 57 consecutive days,
01:38:02.82 --> 01:38:07.78 London was hit. Had he arrived any earlier, who knows what the Royal Navy's reaction would have
01:38:07.78 --> 01:38:12.18 been to his request as it happened as it always happened when opportunity meets courage.
01:38:12.18 --> 01:38:16.98 Draper arrived exactly the right moment. The day Draper caught him volunteered for the Royal
01:38:16.98 --> 01:38:22.10 Navy. He presented himself to the Admiralty at 9 o'clock in the morning. So he goes and volunteers
01:38:22.10 --> 01:38:29.62 to join the Navy. But because of his eyes, by five that afternoon young Draper Kaufman was a sub-lutent
01:38:29.62 --> 01:38:35.22 in his Majesty's Navy. The only one hitch, once again, he was barred from duty at sea.
01:38:36.34 --> 01:38:40.58 Several weeks into his new career, a German bomb landed just outside the hotel in which Kaufman
01:38:40.58 --> 01:38:44.66 was billeted. Had it detonated upon impact, Kaufman's story would have been buried with long
01:38:44.66 --> 01:38:50.50 with the hotel, another footnote in military history, nothing more. As it happened, the bomb hit
01:38:50.50 --> 01:38:56.58 did not, but did not detonate. It's only damage being a 30-foot tunnel gouged into the earth. Before
01:38:56.58 --> 01:39:01.54 long, an army bomb disposal team arrived, cordoned off the area and set to work. With hand tools
01:39:01.54 --> 01:39:06.74 alone, the squad painstakingly dug a path to the bomb and large the hole and short up the sides
01:39:06.74 --> 01:39:12.02 in case of collapse. The objective reached the bomb without disturbing it. Gently unscrew the fuse,
01:39:12.02 --> 01:39:17.06 winch the inert remains from the dirt and accompanied by police and accompanied by police or
01:39:17.06 --> 01:39:22.26 sirens. By police car sirens and loudspeakers, unexploded bomb coming through, transport the
01:39:22.26 --> 01:39:28.50 carcass to a nearby cemetery. This usually this method worked in case it did not. The entire
01:39:28.50 --> 01:39:33.78 bomb disposal team was killed. The next day, Kaufman volunteered for bomb disposal.
01:39:35.06 --> 01:39:40.18 For eight months from September 1940 to May 1941, Hitler waged a war on the British people.
01:39:40.18 --> 01:39:44.66 More than 40,000 civilians were killed, more than 100,000 were injured. The instrument of all
01:39:44.66 --> 01:39:50.74 this destruction was the bomb. Many of these weapons were defective or deranged as in they failed
01:39:50.74 --> 01:39:56.90 the detonate upon impact or were timed to detonate after a bomb disposal team had arrived.
01:39:59.46 --> 01:40:05.38 So that's what he ends up doing. He ends up doing this bomb disposal duty. After a while of
01:40:05.38 --> 01:40:08.98 doing that, he decides he's going to go back to the states once he's back into the states,
01:40:08.98 --> 01:40:15.62 Japanese attack. After two years of waiting, the United States was finally at war. In a few days,
01:40:15.62 --> 01:40:20.66 the message found Kaufman ordering him to get out to Pearl Harbor right now. Imagine that
01:40:20.66 --> 01:40:25.78 Japanese trickery extended beyond strategy and into engineering draper prepared for the worst.
01:40:26.50 --> 01:40:31.06 When shown the 500-pound bomb at Scofield Barracks, he sent everyone else to cover,
01:40:31.06 --> 01:40:36.10 then examined it, sketched it and telephones each nail biting step back to his controller.
01:40:36.10 --> 01:40:40.58 It had been dropped too low. He determined landing on its side instead of its nose.
01:40:40.58 --> 01:40:46.02 What he had visualized as an old-fashioned, oriental puzzle turned out to be the easiest
01:40:46.02 --> 01:40:50.82 job he'd ever had. I couldn't set that bomb off if I had a sledgehammer. He said later,
01:40:50.82 --> 01:40:56.10 to those who witnessed his the bespeckled master, push past the line of gawkers to single-handedly
01:40:56.10 --> 01:40:59.70 disarm the bomb, there were few actions as deserving of praise.
01:40:59.70 --> 01:41:06.10 A couple headlines. DC Man takes live, jab, balma park, gets navy cross, ran the headline
01:41:06.10 --> 01:41:12.42 in the Washington Post. All Florida will rejoice with re-radmult James L. Kaufman on being the
01:41:12.42 --> 01:41:20.58 father of Soworthy Assun. So there you go. That's where draper Kaufman comes from.
01:41:20.58 --> 01:41:37.46 Yeah, draper is, there's some folks in the that spent their lives looking at the history of
01:41:37.46 --> 01:41:44.98 naval special warfare. And they know more about this history than even I do. I mean, I specialized
01:41:44.98 --> 01:41:49.06 over the, you know, like I said, the period from World War II to the period of Vietnam. They have a
01:41:49.06 --> 01:41:57.06 even fuller account than I do. And one of the things that annoys them is that draper Kaufman
01:41:57.06 --> 01:42:02.66 has risen to this sort of, you know, like I said, legendary status. He's, you know, considered by many
01:42:02.66 --> 01:42:11.14 the, the father of America's Frogman. He's not. He doesn't, he doesn't create the UDT, he doesn't
01:42:11.14 --> 01:42:19.86 create the Frogman. He, he happens to be the pivotal person at multiple points in that history.
01:42:20.58 --> 01:42:26.26 But he's not the, he's not the godfather like everybody or not like many people have suggested
01:42:26.26 --> 01:42:33.06 that he is including his sister who wrote, you know, pretty decent biography of him. But like I
01:42:33.06 --> 01:42:38.98 said, he is, he is, he's a consequential person. What's also interesting about him is that he is,
01:42:38.98 --> 01:42:47.54 like everybody else in this book, is he is, he's making decisions or he, he's, he's deciding to do
01:42:47.54 --> 01:42:55.22 everything. He does, he's not a, he's not a victim of history. He's not writing a wave like, like a
01:42:55.22 --> 01:43:01.46 lot of people, you know, would suggest were all sort of doing. Like the, there's a, there's a,
01:43:01.46 --> 01:43:06.18 there's a metaphor that people use to describe the transformation of the seal teams. And that's the
01:43:06.18 --> 01:43:11.62 evolution. We've all seen that sort of painting at P's where you've got the, you know, the naked
01:43:11.62 --> 01:43:15.46 warrior crawling out of the surf and then you've got this sort of Vietnam guy sort of crouched and,
01:43:15.46 --> 01:43:21.78 you know, wearing his, a tiger strike fatigues, you know, all, and next to the, the seal and Iraq
01:43:21.78 --> 01:43:27.22 Rafghanistan wearing the body arm and everything. That they call that transformation, the evolution,
01:43:27.22 --> 01:43:35.62 sort of suggest though that this, that this transformation was one inevitable and that it didn't
01:43:35.62 --> 01:43:45.86 require the, the intent, the, all of these folks who have this consequential role in our history,
01:43:46.66 --> 01:43:50.82 had and they, they clearly had intent. I mean, when Draper's going through his history,
01:43:51.62 --> 01:43:58.50 or his biography, he's deciding that he's going to go serve in the French army. And when the,
01:43:58.50 --> 01:44:02.98 the Germans sent him home after he's released from the POW camp and they, you know, make him
01:44:02.98 --> 01:44:06.58 sign the stockament that he's going to go back to the states and he'll never take up arms against
01:44:06.58 --> 01:44:12.82 the German Empire again. He intentionally decides that he's not going to do that. He's going to
01:44:12.82 --> 01:44:18.98 go join the British Navy and he's going to continue, he continually does this and just like
01:44:18.98 --> 01:44:24.58 everybody in the book, they are, they're not victims. They're each of these characters. They all have
01:44:24.58 --> 01:44:30.02 agency and they all decide that they're going to do these things for whatever reason. Mostly it's
01:44:30.02 --> 01:44:38.42 the decision that they arrive at is to satisfy what they have decided is their version of
01:44:38.42 --> 01:44:48.98 relevance. There's a spot where you say basically, Draper Kaufman is not really the Godfather that
01:44:48.98 --> 01:44:57.46 people, some people give him credit for of the frogman, but such a consequential guy. He is a consequential
01:44:57.46 --> 01:45:02.18 guy and you're right. He's not the, he's not the, the father of America's frogman. Kelly Turner is
01:45:02.18 --> 01:45:06.42 a Kelly Turner creates the UDTs. Nobody would have done it in a pleasant for Kelly Turner. He wants
01:45:06.42 --> 01:45:13.78 the UDTs because the Marine Corps, every step they frustrate his plans to use reconnaissance troops.
01:45:13.78 --> 01:45:22.98 And Kelly Turner, he's, Kelly Turner wants to control everything in his orbit. And so he
01:45:22.98 --> 01:45:27.78 creates the UDTs to do just that. He's, the, the demolition is sort of secondary. He wants a
01:45:27.78 --> 01:45:33.54 reconnaissance force that he owns. And Draper just happens to be the vehicle for Kelly Turner's.
01:45:35.94 --> 01:45:43.22 You know, once we pick, we do pick up with with Draper Kaufman though. You say as such,
01:45:43.22 --> 01:45:46.90 who better start the Navy's underwater demolition course in the second world war than the
01:45:46.90 --> 01:45:50.58 man who'd seen the most of it. The man who'd seen the most of it, a sailor for whom no barrier
01:45:50.58 --> 01:45:56.66 ever held and who was about to squeeze his biography into a syllabus like none that had ever existed.
01:45:57.46 --> 01:46:01.46 To create the type of amphibious engineer that he envisioned, envisioned,
01:46:01.46 --> 01:46:07.14 Kaufman needed elbow room, like Pettacord before him, he found his elbows had ample space in
01:46:07.14 --> 01:46:14.58 four pierce Florida. To create such a unit, he would require students with, in his words, both
01:46:14.58 --> 01:46:20.34 temperamental stability and individual initiative. To that end, Kaufman insisted that candidates
01:46:20.34 --> 01:46:26.10 be subjected to very heavy physical training, very heavy, he emphasized again. As he knew from
01:46:26.10 --> 01:46:30.90 his own career, first in France, then in the blitz, this type of experience would show students
01:46:30.90 --> 01:46:35.78 that they could push beyond their physical limits, doing without sleep and food and warmth,
01:46:35.78 --> 01:46:40.74 and still function without their arms falling off. More important, training of such intensity,
01:46:40.74 --> 01:46:47.06 would create its in its students' sense of purpose and unity like nothing except actual war.
01:46:50.18 --> 01:46:51.38 Fast forward a little bit.
01:46:53.38 --> 01:46:58.74 Short on time, eager to screen out the obvious people that would not make it physically and
01:46:58.74 --> 01:47:04.50 long on his desire to simulate an experience that was as close to war as possible.
01:47:04.50 --> 01:47:11.78 Kaufman decided that all three problems could be solved by the same solution, one week of misery.
01:47:12.90 --> 01:47:18.50 Never reluctant to ask for help, he walked south along Tent Row until he came to the section
01:47:18.50 --> 01:47:23.06 reserved for the Scouts and Raiders. There still six months away from being transferred,
01:47:23.06 --> 01:47:28.50 Pettacord listened to Kaufman's proposal. He had never been asked to compress the Scouts and
01:47:28.50 --> 01:47:34.10 Raiders' eight week physical training, conditioning course into one block of uninterrupted training.
01:47:34.74 --> 01:47:39.62 Certainly men could be pushed indeed nearly broken, but what Kaufman had asked to do was
01:47:39.62 --> 01:47:45.14 another matter. In the end, Pettacord agreed, what else could he do? This was Kaufman, the C's
01:47:45.14 --> 01:47:52.26 parted at his arrival. What Pettacord did not know, no one did, was that he was about to help create
01:47:52.26 --> 01:48:00.10 the sacramental cup from which nearly all future naval commandos would drink.
01:48:01.54 --> 01:48:08.34 You were wet, chafed with sand, just completely miserable. Remember, Frank Kane years later,
01:48:08.34 --> 01:48:12.98 in the daytime men melted under the sun. At night, they shook so hard from the wet and cold
01:48:12.98 --> 01:48:17.54 that their hip flexors swelled and cramped. Their teeth chattered like jack hammers,
01:48:17.54 --> 01:48:22.74 shouldering boats, sloshing with water, they marched for miles and sand and dunes that collapse
01:48:22.74 --> 01:48:27.54 beneath every step. Soden fatigues adhered to the grit and sand,
01:48:28.82 --> 01:48:35.54 turning armpits, thighs, and scrotums into raw meat. If any instructor detected a student
01:48:35.54 --> 01:48:41.22 on the stealth and concealment problem, as he warmed his, his chafed and dripping body
01:48:41.22 --> 01:48:47.30 to the plantation house, the man was punished by being sent to sit inside where swarms of mosquitoes,
01:48:47.30 --> 01:48:53.30 feasted on his misery. In addition to simple surf drills, rubber boat training included hours
01:48:53.30 --> 01:48:59.62 of paddling while harassed by the nearby air squadrons F4 pilots who would try to nail the
01:48:59.62 --> 01:49:06.26 floating rafts with sacks of flower bombs. Jettie landings and night portages were attuned by
01:49:06.26 --> 01:49:12.10 based ambulances and performed over boulders as broad as dinner tables, the endless surf smashing
01:49:12.10 --> 01:49:17.78 the panels and men against the rocks. Intended to simulate the long drain of campaign march
01:49:17.78 --> 01:49:24.82 before battle, this seemingly endless harassment ultimately culminated in a day-long mock skirmish
01:49:24.82 --> 01:49:32.26 known as the extended order problem or to the students so-solid day. Beginning before dawn,
01:49:32.26 --> 01:49:37.70 students raced off the ramps of their landing craft just as the beach erupted in fundering sheets
01:49:37.70 --> 01:49:43.38 of flame. For a whole day instructors armed with charges on least a torn of exploding
01:49:43.38 --> 01:49:49.22 columns of water and showers of mud and debris. The students belly crawled on throbbing knees and
01:49:49.22 --> 01:49:56.10 elbows into hip-deep mud, swamps and surf as the explosions chased them from cover and foxholes.
01:49:56.90 --> 01:50:02.02 Until Kaufman's regime, no navy unit had been subjected to training course whose
01:50:02.02 --> 01:50:08.66 essence so closely resembled that of real war. The frantic harassment, the inescapable cold,
01:50:08.66 --> 01:50:14.82 the relentless exhaustion, not only did it prepare for what was to come, it set them apart from
01:50:14.82 --> 01:50:21.30 everyone else in the navy. Even in the early classes, as many as half the men who started did not
01:50:21.30 --> 01:50:28.34 complete the week. That was entirely the point, modeling his project on the culture of the core
01:50:28.34 --> 01:50:34.98 frunk, Kaufman had set out to forge both in a spree decor and the reputation that always accompanies
01:50:34.98 --> 01:50:40.98 it. Exclusivity. If you haven't been through it, he would later say, you're not a demolition
01:50:40.98 --> 01:50:49.38 year. In August 1943, Kaufman volunteered for his own program. At 32 years old, with eyesight
01:50:49.38 --> 01:50:55.14 not good enough to qualify for his own demolition standards, he was hardly an ideal candidate.
01:50:55.14 --> 01:51:02.10 I think I have never seen a man struggle so desperately, Warlock said after witnessing Kaufman's
01:51:02.10 --> 01:51:08.18 performance. The moment he finished his 10-mile beach run, he passed out. During the ocean swim,
01:51:08.18 --> 01:51:12.50 Warlock thought he would drown. We all knew he wasn't a great athlete said,
01:51:12.50 --> 01:51:18.18 Frank Kane, and we thought, hell, if he can make it, we can too. Throughout the training,
01:51:18.18 --> 01:51:24.10 Kaufman listed, but never sank, alternately encouraging and bullying his boat crew from start to finish.
01:51:24.10 --> 01:51:31.22 As one remembered with his bloody battle cry of core frunk, when men showed signs of cracking
01:51:31.22 --> 01:51:36.34 during another bone-trolling dip in the ocean, Kaufman turned it into a joke, annoyingly repeating
01:51:36.34 --> 01:51:42.34 the same mocking phrase. The water he boomed in his strong, mid-Atlantic accent is never cold.
01:51:43.78 --> 01:51:48.50 The Monday after Kaufman completed this week, he was ordered to report to captain at
01:51:48.50 --> 01:51:54.98 clearance, goldbrunson, the base commander of Fort Pierce, swole in from head to foot,
01:51:54.98 --> 01:51:59.14 with fingers like sausages ready to burst, he crawled out of bed and staggered into the
01:51:59.14 --> 01:52:05.62 commander's office. What's this I hear about 40% of your classes either being in the sick bay
01:52:05.62 --> 01:52:10.18 or quitting the captain bark? I don't think you have any idea what you're putting these men through
01:52:10.18 --> 01:52:19.38 draper. I do Kaufman responded, it was hell. When Kaufman's trainees completed hell week, the name,
01:52:19.38 --> 01:52:25.06 his week of misery inevitably took on, their demolitions training program progressed to its
01:52:25.06 --> 01:52:31.78 next phase, two weeks of explosives, two week of reconnaissance, and three weeks of practical exercises.
01:52:31.78 --> 01:52:44.82 So there you go, freaking hell week. Yeah, created by, I mean we look around them and how many
01:52:44.82 --> 01:52:50.82 team guys do you know that would fit his bill today? I mean we kind of think that we sort of
01:52:50.82 --> 01:52:57.46 created ourselves. I mean we have a lot of people that sort of came together to create this
01:52:57.46 --> 01:53:03.70 program and they're not, they don't look like us. I mean they were sailors, ship fleet sailors.
01:53:03.70 --> 01:53:09.30 I mean they put this thing together and somebody who's you know the most unlikely person,
01:53:10.10 --> 01:53:15.86 draper Kaufman is not what you would think of as a modern day sealer, modern day frogman. In fact
01:53:15.86 --> 01:53:21.78 you don't want to be, he just I mean he's he sort of continues to do the thing that he doesn't
01:53:21.78 --> 01:53:27.14 really want to do because that's the right thing that he you know it's the thing that's going to
01:53:27.14 --> 01:53:31.54 accomplish the mission that he's been given which is to demolish Hitler's Atlantic wall. He doesn't
01:53:31.54 --> 01:53:36.26 know how else to do it. So you know he squeezes every drop of his biography into this curriculum.
01:53:41.06 --> 01:53:45.86 Fast forward a little bit, actually fast forward a pretty good chunk going into D-Day.
01:53:45.86 --> 01:53:53.62 And again you're your detail and the the research that you did to get here is just it's unbelievable
01:53:53.62 --> 01:53:57.86 the read. With terrified soldiers frozen in place neither advancing or retreating,
01:53:57.86 --> 01:54:02.82 Freeman and Kaley, Kaley sprinted between post yelling of senators and kicking the
01:54:02.82 --> 01:54:07.86 infantry men away. Once clear Freeman gave the signal, tossed a purple smoke grenade and
01:54:07.86 --> 01:54:14.18 petty officer bass pulled the fuse fire in the hole at 655 only 22 minutes after landing the whole
01:54:14.18 --> 01:54:20.82 area exploded and a roar that drowned out the battles did. Shooting skyward a mixture of water,
01:54:20.82 --> 01:54:26.82 smoke, wood, sand and steel high into the air. The defenders response was vicious as soon as the
01:54:26.82 --> 01:54:31.78 smoke and debris settled the fire from the hills became unbearable. As mingled off the
01:54:31.78 --> 01:54:37.30 Georgian with a hole in his leg crawled hand over hand to the sea wall and safety around slam
01:54:37.30 --> 01:54:42.98 through his helmet into his forehead killing him instantly. With the obstacles blown in the beach
01:54:42.98 --> 01:54:48.74 cover gone petty officer bass a former CB from Durham North Carolina resisted the urge to run and
01:54:48.74 --> 01:54:53.46 instead found Seaman Farrell alone. Still writhing from the hole in his knee and with a fresh
01:54:53.46 --> 01:54:59.14 room wound to his right eye. Bass bent down to cradle the boy to cover him and as he did a bullet
01:54:59.14 --> 01:55:03.46 tore through his back and ring just to the right of his spine and blowing a hole out as right
01:55:03.46 --> 01:55:08.90 shoulder. Sergeant Murphy one of the army's naval augmenties found them both and dragged him to the
01:55:08.90 --> 01:55:14.02 sea wall. Wounded himself and with nearly everyone in his crew either shot or dead,
01:55:14.02 --> 01:55:19.46 Freeman was unstoppable blasting obstacles clearing out infantry men before his charges blue,
01:55:19.46 --> 01:55:25.78 helping his wounded to cover. Though they had been cut to shreds, gapless old team one had completed
01:55:25.78 --> 01:55:36.02 his mission. Their 50 yard gap was clear and that's just one little chunk of the detail that you
01:55:36.02 --> 01:55:41.14 give on all these heroic acts that are going on by fast forward by morning, by morning's
01:55:41.14 --> 01:55:45.14 ed with the help of Hall's destroyers that gapless old teams had partially cleared five of their
01:55:45.14 --> 01:55:51.70 16 target sections along Omaha Beach by nightfall the total was 10. For the NCD use and
01:55:51.70 --> 01:55:57.06 accomplishment that came at a cost prematurely estimated two dozen dead at least that many wounded
01:55:57.06 --> 01:56:02.42 and 15 more missing. These lastity there been blown clear of their landing vessels and drowned
01:56:02.42 --> 01:56:08.34 or in the words of one writer had run off to fight with the army. In fact some had done just that
01:56:08.34 --> 01:56:18.02 or at least abandoned their section of beach. As a handful of planners that expected,
01:56:18.02 --> 01:56:23.94 the most difficult aspect of Rommel's Atlantic wall had been the beach and the underwater
01:56:23.94 --> 01:56:28.98 obstacles a problem that had been overcome only because of the Navy's commitment. First in
01:56:28.98 --> 01:56:33.86 identifying the issue, necks and commissioning, coughment assault that then in sharing those
01:56:33.86 --> 01:56:38.98 lessons with the army's combat engineers. Ultimately however the Navy's greatest contribution
01:56:38.98 --> 01:56:44.98 had come from the NCD use themselves. In addition to the presidential unit citation Admiral Hall
01:56:44.98 --> 01:56:51.22 had gone on to recognize the demolition years by recommending them a trunk full of individual awards
01:56:51.22 --> 01:56:57.06 individual awards including six Navy crosses, one of which went to chief pedi officer Bill Freeman.
01:56:57.06 --> 01:57:02.82 I kicked myself ever since that I didn't recommend him for a metal varnish hall said later.
01:57:02.82 --> 01:57:06.42 I never heard of anybody who did a greater job than that fellow did.
01:57:07.78 --> 01:57:11.70 Responsible for getting the army passed the underwater obstacles on Omaha Beach,
01:57:11.70 --> 01:57:17.38 the NCD use achievement was in the end made possible only by their training at Fort Pierce.
01:57:17.38 --> 01:57:21.30 There they had learned not only the technical skills of underwater demolition,
01:57:21.30 --> 01:57:26.90 the explosives, the pull fuses, the minimum safe distances, but also as Kaufman had insisted
01:57:26.90 --> 01:57:32.34 the ability to push past the limits of normal human endurance to withstand cold, hunger,
01:57:32.34 --> 01:57:38.74 raw skin, exhaustion even the chaos of combat, the kind of fortitude that made winning wars possible.
01:57:38.74 --> 01:57:42.90 Only our vigorous training held us together once survivors said afterward,
01:57:42.90 --> 01:57:48.42 but what about what about after that? With the collapse of the Atlantic wall, the mission of the
01:57:48.42 --> 01:57:54.10 NCD use had been accomplished and therefore no unit in the U.S. military was in greater threat
01:57:54.10 --> 01:57:59.70 of disbandement or at least would have been had not been for one final hang up.
01:57:59.70 --> 01:58:04.34 The Navy's planners were low to disband a unit that had just performed so effectively.
01:58:04.74 --> 01:58:10.26 After all, the war was far from over and there was no shortage of needs for sailors so
01:58:10.26 --> 01:58:12.66 conditioned to the combat that lay ahead.
01:58:15.30 --> 01:58:20.34 Boom. Yeah, it's, I mean, I don't know about you, but nobody ever connected
01:58:20.34 --> 01:58:27.46 a hell-week or the reason for hell-week to Omaha Beach, but I don't think that we would have
01:58:27.46 --> 01:58:33.30 that crucible today if it wasn't for that, it justified everything that Kaufman did.
01:58:37.06 --> 01:58:44.10 I mean, we later in the war, you see lots of people get pulled over to the U.D.T.
01:58:44.10 --> 01:58:50.74 whether they're C.B.'s or Marines or even soldiers in some instances. And those, you know,
01:58:52.02 --> 01:58:55.78 they don't necessarily go through hell-week. If it had not been for that experience,
01:58:56.66 --> 01:59:03.38 it's likely that we would not have this, that crucible. And without that crucible,
01:59:03.38 --> 01:59:07.54 what would the seal teams be? They'd be another command of force, but would they be
01:59:08.82 --> 01:59:12.58 everything that we are today? I mean, that's the defining moment of training.
01:59:12.58 --> 01:59:16.66 All right. I mean, yeah. Well, you called it the Sacramento Cup.
01:59:16.66 --> 01:59:20.50 Yeah. It is the Sacramento. I mean, we all have these, I mean,
01:59:22.82 --> 01:59:26.66 there's institutions all around us with institutions with the U.S. Constitution, or
01:59:26.66 --> 01:59:33.86 there, whatever, your Catholicism. I mean, that your faith has these little institutions built into it.
01:59:33.86 --> 01:59:38.82 And, you know, if you're going to take the canochism, there's all these sacraments that you've got to do.
01:59:38.82 --> 01:59:45.30 And what's more, what's a bigger sacrament, and, you know, the becoming of the seal, then,
01:59:46.02 --> 01:59:54.42 that hell-week? Yeah. Not one. You get into next, Tarawa.
01:59:55.62 --> 02:00:00.82 And what happens at Tarawa, which is a total nightmare. I don't know if you had the chance,
02:00:00.82 --> 02:00:06.50 we had a guy, Dean Ladd, that was on this podcast, and he was a Marine Corps.
02:00:06.50 --> 02:00:10.10 Wow. I think he was a, I think it was a first lieutenant by that time.
02:00:11.22 --> 02:00:17.54 That did a bunch of islands, including Tarawa. Got gut shot, Tarawa 800 yards from the beach.
02:00:17.54 --> 02:00:21.86 Two Marines, disobeyed orders to leave him and move forward and drag him back to a boat.
02:00:21.86 --> 02:00:28.58 He survived and ended up going back. But yeah, you detail what happened there, how bad it was.
02:00:29.54 --> 02:00:36.18 And basically, if you don't know anyone that doesn't know the Marine Corps hit reefs on the way in.
02:00:36.18 --> 02:00:43.30 And the boats got hung up, and so the guys had to get out and walk with no protection whatsoever
02:00:43.30 --> 02:00:48.66 through the ocean. 800, it was around 800 yards to get to the beach where there was,
02:00:50.74 --> 02:00:56.74 once they got to the beach, it was hell as well. So, and we've always known that Tarawa is the moment
02:00:56.74 --> 02:01:01.62 that, you know, the need for UDTs is identified. We don't exactly know the reason, though.
02:01:01.62 --> 02:01:07.22 I mean, because the Marine Corps, they come up with the solution or what they perceive to be the solution
02:01:07.22 --> 02:01:12.50 before the Tarawa battle even commences. And that, like I described, is the landing vehicle
02:01:12.50 --> 02:01:17.06 tractor, the LBT. It's a technical problem. They have a technical solution for it.
02:01:18.42 --> 02:01:25.46 The problem with that is Turner doesn't like their solution. Kelly Turner sees the cancer, or it
02:01:25.46 --> 02:01:32.50 sees the coral as a cancer. It's going to complicate everything as far as all the rest of the
02:01:32.50 --> 02:01:38.26 campaigns ahead of him. He doesn't want to deal with us. He wants that coral out so he can get his
02:01:38.26 --> 02:01:41.22 Higgins boats to the beach. And the only way to do that is to find him.
02:01:41.78 --> 02:01:48.34 Yeah, and what's interesting, too, is after Tarawa, the Marine Corps solution was,
02:01:49.46 --> 02:01:53.38 you know, like you said, it was just more. Yeah, more. Yeah, just okay. So, we're going to lose
02:01:53.38 --> 02:01:58.02 X percentage of boats on the way and cool. More. We're going to lose this many LTVs on the way and
02:01:58.02 --> 02:02:03.22 cool. More. Bring us more. That was their answer. And Turner was saying, hey, actually not a good
02:02:03.22 --> 02:02:07.54 answer. Well, let's figure out how to solve this problem. Yeah, Churchill's quote, you know, we've
02:02:07.54 --> 02:02:13.78 run out of money now. It's time to think. I mean, you could just say, you know, just as much
02:02:13.78 --> 02:02:18.74 when it comes to logistics. There, I mean, there's nothing that compares with the US military
02:02:18.74 --> 02:02:24.10 logistics and manufacturing might going into this. But we still have limits. You can't, these
02:02:24.10 --> 02:02:28.42 LVTs, they take up a ton of space on all the ships that the Navy's going to use to transport
02:02:28.42 --> 02:02:34.02 them. The Higgins boats, they're easier to carry, they're faster in the water. You can time
02:02:34.02 --> 02:02:40.18 everything from Naval Gunfare to aircraft coming into the support of the landings if you have a
02:02:40.18 --> 02:02:45.86 faster vehicle to get them from the ships to the shores. And that's what Turner wants. He wants to
02:02:45.86 --> 02:02:51.22 be able to get his ships as quickly to the beach as possible. It's the safest way. It's the easiest
02:02:51.22 --> 02:02:55.14 to get everything there. And the only way to do that is to find the coral to get rid of it.
02:02:57.14 --> 02:03:01.78 We start training now, but under Turner's direction, we start training. We're training Hawaii now.
02:03:03.62 --> 02:03:09.06 In May, a fresh batch of NCDU recruits arrived in Maui, per the direction of Colour and Kaufman,
02:03:09.06 --> 02:03:13.06 the men were told to abandon the bulk of their gear. Their green fatigues, their boots,
02:03:13.06 --> 02:03:18.90 their May-West life jackets, even their helmets and sidearms, and slip into a pair of black Maui
02:03:18.90 --> 02:03:24.74 swim trunks and dive masks. Their rough rubber edges sanded down to prevent them from biting into
02:03:24.74 --> 02:03:29.30 their face. What followed were nine seemingly endless days of training on how to systematically
02:03:29.30 --> 02:03:35.46 map an underwater landscape and blow it up. Rocks, coral, night swimming blast, no rest, no sleep,
02:03:35.46 --> 02:03:42.18 suicide stuff, one trainee remembered. For no fewer than six hours a day, recruits lived in the
02:03:42.18 --> 02:03:46.50 water, perfecting their strokes until they could swim a mile before breakfast. Their only day off
02:03:46.50 --> 02:03:51.22 was Monday, when possible. Seeing that this was the first time many of them in handled explosive
02:03:51.22 --> 02:03:56.74 fused or tied, primer cord into a trunk line, accidents were routine. Fingers blown clear off
02:03:56.74 --> 02:04:01.54 or hanging by bloody shreds of skin. Asked how long he could swim underwater with a hundred
02:04:01.54 --> 02:04:07.30 pounds of powder, recruit, canoric, replied, with a hundred pounds of powder, I could probably
02:04:07.30 --> 02:04:13.54 stay under forever. So this is, I highlighted that port because this is a point now where we're
02:04:13.54 --> 02:04:17.54 starting to see the idea of the naked warrior, they're getting rid of all their dear, they're just
02:04:17.54 --> 02:04:29.22 wearing trunks. Sipan is where we get this recon, like a legit recon going on. The closer his
02:04:29.22 --> 02:04:32.74 swimmer's got to the beach, the more nervous Kaufman became. At a hundred yards, he tried to
02:04:32.74 --> 02:04:37.30 turn them around, but most of them kept going at 50 yards, some began to pivot back, but some didn't.
02:04:37.30 --> 02:04:41.94 Closing to within 30 yards of the shore and 40 yards of the guns, so close that they
02:04:42.98 --> 02:04:47.30 ceased swimming and dug their toes of their sneakers into the sand, pulling themselves along
02:04:47.30 --> 02:04:52.74 with their gloves hands. When that last line finally did run out of water, each man backed off
02:04:52.74 --> 02:04:57.46 slightly turned left, then side stroked along the beach for 25 yards, edging his mask out of the
02:04:57.46 --> 02:05:02.18 water with every breath, breath careful to remember the locations of any gun positions under
02:05:02.18 --> 02:05:08.50 circumstances, not an easy thing to forget. On the swim back, each man ignored his exhaustion
02:05:08.50 --> 02:05:14.26 and worsening leg cramps and stayed as close as possible to the bottom. When they near the
02:05:14.26 --> 02:05:19.54 reef Kaufman reborn, it is mattress and offered a nearby swimmer a toe, get that damn thing
02:05:19.54 --> 02:05:23.54 out of here. This is, you go over this earlier, all the little rafts that they have were getting shot
02:05:23.54 --> 02:05:28.42 up. On the other side of the now surf slammed reef, each swimmer waited for pickup. When the landing
02:05:28.42 --> 02:05:34.26 craft arrived, the coxants took turns motoring each man and either drop. Drop them a Jacobs
02:05:34.26 --> 02:05:39.14 ladder or reverse the engines until he could grab hold and pull himself up. Throughout this
02:05:39.14 --> 02:05:45.22 cumbersome boarding a period packed with versiferous cursing, his head one survivor every man
02:05:45.22 --> 02:05:49.94 aboard fully expected a mortar round to drop square into the boat. As soon as the last man
02:05:49.94 --> 02:05:54.18 was loaded, Kaufman tallied his numbers and realized that in addition to the officer killed
02:05:54.18 --> 02:05:58.58 on the air mattress, two of his swimmers were still missing. Pulled in separate directions by
02:05:58.58 --> 02:06:03.14 his instinct to rescue it and his orders to rush back to the fleet, Kaufman looked around at his
02:06:03.14 --> 02:06:08.50 blue tinge to black stripe men and chose the more painful option with the fleet waiting for his
02:06:08.50 --> 02:06:14.58 information. Kaufman ordered his boats back to the APDs. When the men of UDT7 arrived back at the
02:06:14.58 --> 02:06:19.38 Humphries, they discovered something remarkable. Though several men had been wounded,
02:06:19.38 --> 02:06:24.18 some with serious internal injuries from the mortar blasts, not a single one of their swimmers had
02:06:24.18 --> 02:06:29.30 been lost. In fact, the only men that had been killed had been the ones who had remained on the
02:06:29.30 --> 02:06:34.66 LCPRs as they had waited for swimmers to return. Kaufman's UDT5 swimmers had been slightly
02:06:34.66 --> 02:06:39.22 left less fortunate with one killed several more wounded and two still missing, but it was
02:06:39.22 --> 02:06:42.98 nothing compared to the bloodbath that occurred just one week before it normally.
02:06:42.98 --> 02:06:50.98 So this is another methodology of execute these things. And it's sort of a metaphor for
02:06:50.98 --> 02:06:59.54 what actually happened, the entire history. So the Navy intentionally creates all of these units.
02:06:59.54 --> 02:07:04.74 They create NCDUs, they create UDT, they create the scouts and raiders. All of these units are
02:07:04.74 --> 02:07:11.06 created for a specific purpose, they're committed to action for a specific reason. But once the
02:07:11.06 --> 02:07:16.82 Navy creates these things, the Navy can't necessarily predict how far the individuals that are
02:07:16.82 --> 02:07:20.66 the belong to these institutions are going to push them. They're going to push those envelopes.
02:07:20.66 --> 02:07:25.30 So Kaufman, when he's driving his men toward the beach or he's pushing his men to swim,
02:07:25.30 --> 02:07:29.54 he also is trying to stop them. He's trying to stop them 50 yards from a shore they won't
02:07:29.54 --> 02:07:36.10 they keep going 25 yards. So the seal teams are created by the Navy, they're created by the Navy
02:07:36.10 --> 02:07:44.18 for the Navy. But you can sort of see it just in that moment. The seal teams become so much more
02:07:44.18 --> 02:07:49.06 because of the seals themselves. So the seals don't create it. We don't. We're not responsible for
02:07:49.06 --> 02:07:53.94 our own institutions. We think we are, but we're not. But we are responsible for what that
02:07:53.94 --> 02:07:57.78 institutional ultimately became. Yeah, you know, there's an interesting time that you make in the
02:07:57.78 --> 02:08:05.22 book. And I don't remember, it's in my nose to Carl Rho's. I'll just mention it now. The Navy, the Navy,
02:08:06.66 --> 02:08:11.86 just by nature of being disaggregated and being spread apart, especially back in the day,
02:08:11.86 --> 02:08:18.66 there was decentralized command unlike really unlike any other organization. Absolutely. And that
02:08:18.66 --> 02:08:23.54 that spirit of decentralized command of like, hey, you go and you take the fight to the enemy.
02:08:23.54 --> 02:08:28.58 You get in this ship or you get in this submarine, you go overseas and you take the fight to the
02:08:28.58 --> 02:08:33.94 enemy. That's you have mission type orders. Right. And that's that's the way the Navy had
02:08:33.94 --> 02:08:41.38 had to exist back in the day and that vein and that DNA remains. And that's why you get these
02:08:41.38 --> 02:08:47.62 guys that are very proactive and will will be default aggressive out there on the battlefield.
02:08:47.62 --> 02:08:55.46 That's exactly right. Default aggressive. Latitude only works if your default orientation or
02:08:56.26 --> 02:09:02.66 default setting is aggression. And if you read any like naval history book during like
02:09:03.38 --> 02:09:08.42 the Napoleonic Wars or if you read the Patrick O'Brien Master in Commander series,
02:09:08.42 --> 02:09:14.10 like you're never, you know, connect to your channel command. Whereas the army always is.
02:09:14.10 --> 02:09:20.18 So that, you know, as technology has improved or as technology's gotten better to connect
02:09:20.18 --> 02:09:25.06 commanders to their troops in the field, that chain of command has only thickened. Whereas in the
02:09:25.06 --> 02:09:30.50 Navy, I mean, we have all of the history behind us or the Navy has all of the history behind it
02:09:30.50 --> 02:09:36.10 of latitude, of mission type orders, of relying on the aggressiveness of the individual commander.
02:09:36.82 --> 02:09:42.58 You just have to trust your guys. But you have to be specific about what you want. Oh, for sure.
02:09:42.58 --> 02:09:48.98 So otherwise you get rogue. Exactly. You do talk about what the UDT's brought back from that.
02:09:48.98 --> 02:09:53.06 And what they brought back was good information. Good intel that they could then form into a
02:09:53.06 --> 02:09:58.50 make a better battle plan. The invasion of sidepan goes smoother. Fast forward a little bit by the
02:09:58.50 --> 02:10:03.30 fall of 1944. The Navy's underwater demolition teams were the most indispensable of all
02:10:03.30 --> 02:10:08.34 US military's special operations units. A facet directly attributed to the Central Pacific
02:10:08.34 --> 02:10:12.74 planners who would no longer go anywhere without their reconnaissance reports.
02:10:14.18 --> 02:10:18.10 The UDT's were an essential part of amphibious organization for the remainder of the war
02:10:18.10 --> 02:10:24.10 wrote Turner on the last day of combat on Tinian. It is questionable if we could have made our
02:10:24.10 --> 02:10:30.18 landing except after the great losses, except after great losses if we had not had these teams
02:10:30.18 --> 02:10:35.38 to prepare the way. This assessment was immediately echoed by Admiral Connelly who concluded his
02:10:35.38 --> 02:10:42.50 invasion in Guam by declaring that without UDT's discovery and demolition of some 640 obstacles
02:10:42.50 --> 02:10:47.78 along 3,000 yards of beaches, including the nearly car-sized coconut log cribs filled with loose
02:10:47.78 --> 02:10:54.18 coral. The landings quote, would could not have been made. There in spite of orders for bidding
02:10:54.18 --> 02:11:01.06 them to do so, three demolition swimmers, including Gunners' first mate. Gunners first mate,
02:11:01.06 --> 02:11:07.94 Gunners' mate first class, Henry L. Green had grown so convinced of the UDT's worth
02:11:07.94 --> 02:11:13.38 that they had planted a white butcher block-sized sign at the water's edge with the following
02:11:13.38 --> 02:11:20.34 message, US Marine, welcome to the USO, greetings from UDT4. During this, Admiral Connelly had
02:11:20.34 --> 02:11:23.86 summoned the team's commander to a state room in order to hand him a starch counseling.
02:11:23.86 --> 02:11:31.06 But instead, had neutralized his own admonitions by stopping the young officer at the door
02:11:31.06 --> 02:11:36.66 declaring, wait till I tell Turner, he'll have those Marine generals eating crow.
02:11:41.54 --> 02:11:47.86 It's so childish. It's so childish, but that's what it is. How many times have you in your service
02:11:47.86 --> 02:11:56.82 interacted with a sister service? The rivalry exists. It's a brotherhood on the battlefield,
02:11:56.82 --> 02:12:02.82 but still we're always chasing our institutional prologue, or trying to push the boundaries
02:12:02.82 --> 02:12:10.02 of our institutional authority. What's interesting is when you get into the senior ranks,
02:12:10.02 --> 02:12:19.22 there becomes a real tension between the services and the amount of money that they get.
02:12:19.22 --> 02:12:27.78 It becomes a real thing. You say here to recognize their contribution, we're taking of the
02:12:27.78 --> 02:12:33.46 Mariana's Turner showered the UDTs with awards, more than 60 silver stars, 300 bronze stars,
02:12:33.46 --> 02:12:37.46 reported the largest mass recommendation for sailors and Marines in the war up to that point.
02:12:37.46 --> 02:12:42.66 Given the importance of the job, Connley would have pinned Navy crosses on the commanding officers
02:12:42.66 --> 02:12:47.78 of UDT-3 and 4, but ended in the end, settle for silver stars, each of them presented by none other
02:12:47.78 --> 02:12:53.46 than Admiral Kaufman, Draper's father. As for Draper himself, rumors circulated about his
02:12:53.46 --> 02:12:57.78 nomination for the Medal of Honor, an accolade his father, chairman of the awards board in the
02:12:57.78 --> 02:13:03.62 Pacific, lobbied against for fear of the medals association with recklessness. In the end, Draper
02:13:03.62 --> 02:13:08.98 received a Navy cross, his second pinned on by his father with a comment that allowed the photographer
02:13:08.98 --> 02:13:13.94 to catch the serious young man in a laugh. Thank the Lord, you found a clean short.
02:13:17.38 --> 02:13:22.10 Yeah, that's a relationship I could have spent a lot more time on. I mean, he's, you know,
02:13:22.10 --> 02:13:28.58 Draper's dad is out there, you know, in the fleet. He's a Commodore himself and, you know,
02:13:28.58 --> 02:13:34.90 he knows exactly the risks that his son is taking and he does nothing. During the entire war,
02:13:35.78 --> 02:13:44.18 to either convince Turner, you know, to have the UDT take last risk. He just, he's as,
02:13:45.54 --> 02:13:51.22 you know, I don't know as a father and I know your father too. Like, I don't know that I'd be able
02:13:51.22 --> 02:13:55.78 to to keep myself disciplined enough to not interfere.
02:13:55.78 --> 02:14:01.06 Get him orders to the Washington DC admin spot.
02:14:02.26 --> 02:14:06.90 Yeah, I just don't know how. Whatever that impulse, you know, with those guys had,
02:14:06.90 --> 02:14:11.30 I don't know that it's, it exists today. But either that you make a freaking boat
02:14:11.30 --> 02:14:18.98 crew leader in UDT for just break it ready to get some. This is just, you jump into this next
02:14:18.98 --> 02:14:24.10 part chapter six, the contest for the guerilla war in China and the organization that had no
02:14:24.10 --> 02:14:30.74 damn business fighting in it. The US Navy's Army of sailors. This is just freaking buckwild. This
02:14:30.74 --> 02:14:36.66 whole section. I mean, you get this guy born Milton, he Roberts in 1900 in Jerome Arizona,
02:14:36.66 --> 02:14:43.14 Miles spent his first years in a mountainside mining hub called by the New York sun in 1903,
02:14:43.14 --> 02:14:48.02 the wickedest town in the West. He was only a child. He was the only child of a lumber cutter was
02:14:48.02 --> 02:14:52.82 nearly 30 years older than his mother. Before Miles was even eight as father was dead, which was
02:14:52.82 --> 02:14:58.02 something of a blessing as it had given his mother an opportunity to move and remarry then in Seattle,
02:14:58.02 --> 02:15:03.78 a stepfather. Miles had received, from his stepfather, Miles had received the last name he would live with,
02:15:03.78 --> 02:15:09.78 but not much else at 14 miles ran away from home. You just set up this background with this guy.
02:15:09.78 --> 02:15:15.38 He glistened the Navy. He ends up taking some tests to get into the in Ireland to get into the
02:15:15.38 --> 02:15:23.70 Naval Academy. He gets in, goes to the Naval Academy. He gets to play to China for a five-year tour.
02:15:24.82 --> 02:15:32.42 Ends up, you know, doing operations in the Yangzi River. This is the warlord period. He learns
02:15:32.42 --> 02:15:36.98 about leadership diplomacy, geography, small boat handling, how to shoot his way out of a hold-up.
02:15:37.62 --> 02:15:43.54 Unlike most Westerners, picks up various coastal dialects. So this dude's speaking freaking
02:15:43.54 --> 02:15:50.58 Chinese or Mandarin or whatever. He's brilliant. I mean, there's nobody. I mean, like I said,
02:15:50.58 --> 02:15:55.86 I mean, we got our history, not just from, you know, frog men. We got it from, you know, just
02:15:55.86 --> 02:16:01.22 fleet sailors. And this is, I mean, military movie sand pebbles. Yeah.
02:16:01.22 --> 02:16:05.70 This is sand pebbles. Yeah, this is sand. So sand bubbles go watch it if you haven't seen it.
02:16:05.70 --> 02:16:09.86 I know you haven't seen it. I call it Charles because it's a classic. It's an actual good movie.
02:16:09.86 --> 02:16:15.86 There's no, there's not many like CGI explosions in it. But yeah, this is sand pebbles all day.
02:16:15.86 --> 02:16:20.74 We had the movie sand pebbles on one of my arc deployments is back before internet or anything.
02:16:20.74 --> 02:16:24.50 So we just had video tapes. We would watch sand pebbles over and over again.
02:16:25.30 --> 02:16:31.62 And that's what this guy is doing. He's, so he ends up running these freaking guerrillas in China,
02:16:32.18 --> 02:16:37.86 which is nuts. He's, I mean, nobody knows about him today.
02:16:37.86 --> 02:16:42.98 Like he's completely forgotten to history. But I mean, he's every bit is consequential,
02:16:42.98 --> 02:16:49.14 at least as far as the Navy's journey from, you know, the ocean to the land,
02:16:49.14 --> 02:16:53.94 as, you know, say somebody like Lawrence of Arabia. He doesn't have the style of somebody like
02:16:53.94 --> 02:16:58.10 that, which is probably, you know, part of the reason that he's forgotten. And, you know, his book
02:16:58.10 --> 02:17:04.26 a different kind of war is, you know, it's not, you know, some pillars was. But, you know,
02:17:04.26 --> 02:17:10.74 he wrote that thing when he had been diagnosed with, with prostate cancer. So he was racing against
02:17:10.74 --> 02:17:16.10 the clock to, to try and get this recorded. And he was, you know, he knew he only had maybe a year
02:17:16.10 --> 02:17:19.54 to live. And he's, you know, drafting this thing. He's typing up little sections of it.
02:17:20.10 --> 02:17:25.22 His wife is, is, is cutting these sections out to reorder them and he's pushing,
02:17:25.22 --> 02:17:30.90 she's putting these things together with Scotch tape. I actually found that record in the,
02:17:30.90 --> 02:17:38.18 the national archives. It still exists. So he talks about, his wife wrote the forward to the book
02:17:38.18 --> 02:17:42.42 to say, you know, how this was done, how it was cut, retaped together and everything like that.
02:17:42.42 --> 02:17:47.54 And then to see that, to find that in the national archives, the whole, you know, these retaped
02:17:47.54 --> 02:17:54.10 together pages, it's pretty incredible. But, you know, like I said, this guy, he is the Navy's version
02:17:54.10 --> 02:18:01.70 of Lawrence, I'm a Arabia. He's the, it's freaking crazy. Yeah, insane. And he's a flag officer.
02:18:01.70 --> 02:18:05.78 Yeah. And he's involving himself the entire war in these little mini skirmishes and ambushes.
02:18:05.78 --> 02:18:10.66 I mean, he's, I mean, he's almost killed three times just by assassins. Yeah, it's nuts.
02:18:10.66 --> 02:18:14.82 It's a freaking crazy story. And he loses mind in the process. Yeah. Yeah.
02:18:14.82 --> 02:18:18.42 All, you say there's along with his promotion, Admiral King elevated,
02:18:18.42 --> 02:18:23.38 it's, uh, Saco, which is the Cino American Cooperation Organization. This is this group that they got
02:18:23.38 --> 02:18:28.74 running all over China to Naval Group China and act that likewise elevated each camp to a formal,
02:18:28.74 --> 02:18:32.18 and they got all these camps. They got all these camps that have been running this network of camps.
02:18:34.18 --> 02:18:40.02 Uh, uh, an act that likewise elevated each camp to a formal naval unit and invested miles
02:18:40.02 --> 02:18:44.02 with the authority of a group commander, increasing his roles to 600 officers and 2, 2,
02:18:44.02 --> 02:18:50.74 2,400 enlisted men about 300 more than a lot of to a World War 2 battleship and a commitment by the
02:18:50.74 --> 02:18:55.86 Navy that was further augmented by various numbers of Marines, Coast Guard's men radio operators.
02:18:55.86 --> 02:19:01.70 To supply all these men, miles receive two planes. Their engines rarely idle to which ferry
02:19:01.70 --> 02:19:06.42 loads from Chongqing to the various camps. The gas alone for these planes gobbled up as much as
02:19:06.42 --> 02:19:10.98 half of miles monthly tonnage allotmen over the hump, but for the first time in the war,
02:19:10.98 --> 02:19:16.50 Sacco camps began receiving at least a portion of what they deserved. So this guy is running a
02:19:16.50 --> 02:19:21.70 freaking crazy guerrilla war. He's running an army. He's a, he's a naval commander who's running an army
02:19:21.70 --> 02:19:26.58 like, uh, like we talked about earlier. He's running, he has no communication with these units
02:19:26.58 --> 02:19:31.30 for the most part. So he's, he's, he's getting these commanders mostly Marines, uh, that are,
02:19:31.30 --> 02:19:35.30 that are coming to him. He's giving them a spine of sailors to go work with and then this
02:19:35.30 --> 02:19:39.78 Marine commander and these navy sailors are trucking sometimes three months at a time to get to their
02:19:39.78 --> 02:19:44.10 station in China. They set up a camp, they start training Chinese guerrillas and then they commit them
02:19:44.10 --> 02:19:51.38 to action. Um, and because he has no communication with them, he has to rely on the aggressiveness of
02:19:51.38 --> 02:19:56.82 each of these leaders. In some cases, it works out. Some cases, it doesn't. So really, all he's doing at
02:19:56.82 --> 02:20:02.42 this point is just managing his talent pool and assessing whether or not they're sending back,
02:20:02.42 --> 02:20:08.50 you know, aggressive enough reports about the operations that they're undertaking. Uh, anyway.
02:20:08.50 --> 02:20:14.58 Yeah, you, you cover it. I mean, it's just, it's an incredible story again.
02:20:14.58 --> 02:20:19.38 Then probably some books and it's over 10 books. Like, and the thing that like was, uh, I was
02:20:19.38 --> 02:20:25.14 blown away with, and I focused my, uh, attention of this chapter on Camp Six because Camp Six
02:20:25.14 --> 02:20:32.90 is really the only unit, uh, in Soko that is run by, uh, a member of naval special warfare.
02:20:32.90 --> 02:20:39.06 Every, every other camp, uh, except in rare instances is run by a Marine. So the, the legacy of
02:20:39.06 --> 02:20:44.82 those camps is, you know, uh, you know, understandably, you know, a feather in the Marine course cap.
02:20:44.82 --> 02:20:49.54 They should be, uh, nothing but, you know, impressed with the legacy of the, the the Marine Corps
02:20:49.54 --> 02:20:56.42 led units. But, uh, Admiral King towards the, uh, towards the tail end of this period, you know,
02:20:56.42 --> 02:21:00.98 they're running out of Marines descent. And not only that, but the Scouts and Raider program is going away.
02:21:00.98 --> 02:21:08.26 And, well, King doesn't want to go away. He wants to send, uh, you know, sort of quasi-marine sailors
02:21:08.26 --> 02:21:14.74 to backfill, uh, the Marine commitment to Soko. So he repurposes, uh, the Scouts and Raider school
02:21:14.74 --> 02:21:20.02 turns it into the amphibious Raider school and is trying to get as many, uh, marine type sailors
02:21:20.02 --> 02:21:25.54 into Soko as possible, uh, to justify this course. So we don't have to get rid of this course after,
02:21:25.54 --> 02:21:30.74 uh, the end of World War II. Uh, and Camp Six, uh, becomes sort of the repository of
02:21:30.74 --> 02:21:34.98 all of that experience. Buck Houtburn, who you mentioned at the beginning of the book, the, uh, the
02:21:34.98 --> 02:21:41.78 Jewish, uh, Notre Dame quarterback. He gets sent there, uh, Buck, uh, a, a Phil Bucklou, uh, comes,
02:21:41.78 --> 02:21:46.98 comes West and starts, uh, leading reconnaissance, uh, and rating operations. Uh, uh,
02:21:46.98 --> 02:21:55.38 but yeah, Camp Six is the, um, Camp Six is the first, uh, instance of naval special warfare
02:21:55.38 --> 02:22:00.66 really going ashore. And they do everything. They do raids, they do ship attacks,
02:22:00.66 --> 02:22:08.42 uh, by the end of the war. Helpern is literally leading from the saddle, uh, on a horse, uh, and pushing
02:22:08.42 --> 02:22:14.34 his gorillas into action. That's incredible. Yeah. It's, it's freaking, it's just a great story. And again,
02:22:14.34 --> 02:22:22.82 it, it, it, you know, um, I've often said that, you know, when I got the teams, I don't know,
02:22:22.82 --> 02:22:25.62 when you got this still, so it was, there was no doctrine when you got the teams. There was
02:22:25.62 --> 02:22:29.86 no doctrine when I got the teams. You couldn't, if you wanted to know how to do, uh,
02:22:29.86 --> 02:22:34.74 uh, an assault on a target, you, you couldn't look it up. Someone had to tell you,
02:22:34.74 --> 02:22:38.98 your platoon chief, or your LPO was going to teach you how to do it. It wasn't written down anywhere.
02:22:38.98 --> 02:22:42.74 Whereas the army and the Marine Corps, but you can look at exactly how to do a target assault.
02:22:42.74 --> 02:22:46.66 It tells you step by step what to do. So we don't have any doctrine. We have more now,
02:22:47.38 --> 02:22:52.10 but that's one of, uh, one of our biggest weaknesses is that we don't have any doctrine.
02:22:52.82 --> 02:22:56.90 One of our biggest strengths is that we don't have any doctrine. And, and that's why you get a
02:22:56.90 --> 02:23:00.42 freaking guy that's like, oh, what are we going to do? We're going to, we're going to, of course, back
02:23:00.42 --> 02:23:05.06 raids. That's what's happening. Cool. Let's figure out how to do it. And, and again, that decentralized
02:23:05.06 --> 02:23:10.98 command, the default aggressive attitude, that's, that's in, that's got to be in, that's the DNA of the
02:23:10.98 --> 02:23:21.46 seal teams. And it's rooted back to Camp 6. Camp 6. I don't like it. Fast forward. The end of the
02:23:21.46 --> 02:23:25.54 war should have been the happiest day of my life, wrote Miles afterward, tasked with an impossible
02:23:25.54 --> 02:23:29.70 mission, yoke to impossible partners. He had never the less achieved something greater than
02:23:29.70 --> 02:23:34.58 ever been asked of him. A navy run gorilla army and intelligence infrastructure that had
02:23:34.58 --> 02:23:40.10 stretched from Indochina to the Goby desert. Assisted by Marines, his sailors had trained as many
02:23:40.10 --> 02:23:45.54 as a hundred thousand Chinese gorillas. Rest you'd airmen and mission missionaries, blasted open
02:23:45.54 --> 02:23:54.42 Japanese tanks, blown up some 158 bridges, derailed some 66 Japanese trains, sunk 35 Japanese ships,
02:23:54.42 --> 02:24:03.78 raided uncountable Japanese camps, and led at least one cavalry charge on camels. Best estimates
02:24:03.78 --> 02:24:10.10 at the time placed a number of sacco and flickeded casualties at around 26,717 killed,
02:24:10.10 --> 02:24:17.30 8,720 wounded, 646 captured. Of the roughly 2500 Americans who served in psycho,
02:24:17.30 --> 02:24:21.30 five were killed. That's amazing. That's amazing. And this doesn't even
02:24:21.30 --> 02:24:27.70 can consider the strategic impact of psycho because they're tying down a million Japanese troops.
02:24:27.70 --> 02:24:31.46 The entire time. Yeah. Troops that could be fighting on all those islands.
02:24:31.46 --> 02:24:36.10 Right. For sure. For sure. But they can't. A million. I mean, there's, you know, when you
02:24:36.10 --> 02:24:40.50 think of there's 30 or 40,000 Japanese on these islands, when most of these islands somewhere around
02:24:40.50 --> 02:24:44.26 that number, you know, if you have an extra million soldiers to throw into that mix,
02:24:45.06 --> 02:24:49.62 as was true of every successful general in history, Miles success had come at the price of his
02:24:49.62 --> 02:24:55.30 sleep, his health, his family's happiness, and even his sanity. For his sacrifices, he had been
02:24:55.30 --> 02:25:01.78 keep not with praise and press releases, but with troubles bureaucracy and overwaining scrutiny.
02:25:01.78 --> 02:25:09.94 In the end, psycho, along with the Navy's guerrilla warfare effort, received a reward as glamorous
02:25:09.94 --> 02:25:15.62 as an obituary. As Miles bitterly concluded, the month that followed the surrender of Japan was the
02:25:15.62 --> 02:25:26.58 worst through which I lived. After hosting a dinner for many of his psycho officers, this is
02:25:26.58 --> 02:25:32.26 after the war. Miles began rambling, seemingly endless lecture on what the atomic bomb would mean
02:25:32.26 --> 02:25:36.98 for the US Navy's future, as men awkwardly drifted out of the room. Miles continued on
02:25:36.98 --> 02:25:41.62 aware when every man had left, and when the lights had been turned off, after the camp,
02:25:41.62 --> 02:25:45.86 Dr. Confind him to a state room, Miles jumped from the window and took off sprinting through a
02:25:45.86 --> 02:25:50.58 rice patty, chased by a group of American advisors and Chinese guerrillas. He escaped, passed
02:25:50.58 --> 02:25:56.42 them all, and stole a Jeep. As he rattled past his pursuers, he was heard muttering over and over.
02:25:56.42 --> 02:26:01.62 I must get to the drill field. Blocked the road, God damn it, that's an order. He shouted,
02:26:01.62 --> 02:26:05.46 shouted at the camps, Dr. to the driver of a six by six truck. When the Jeep reached the
02:26:05.46 --> 02:26:09.62 road, block Miles jumped out and ordered the truck driver to move. The doctor counterman at the
02:26:09.62 --> 02:26:14.18 order and told Miles to return to his quarters where upon Miles accused everyone of lying to him.
02:26:14.18 --> 02:26:19.54 You're on the sick list. The doctor finally managed. What are you saying, Dr. I'm all right.
02:26:19.54 --> 02:26:24.74 I don't think you are Admiral. The doctor replied nervously and have to officially inform you
02:26:24.74 --> 02:26:29.94 that you are on the sick list and have been relieved of your command. As the words drilled into
02:26:29.94 --> 02:26:34.82 Miles' delusion, the doctor could feel him shaking like a leaf. Finally, Miles relented I.I.
02:26:34.82 --> 02:26:41.70 Dr. He out back into the Jeep or turn to his quarters. Next morning, his place under house arrest
02:26:41.70 --> 02:26:48.34 and his razor compensated in Washington, Metzall, Metzall, Misses Billy Miles, and informed her
02:26:48.74 --> 02:26:53.62 that her husband had a complete mental breakdown and that they could only hope he had not suffered
02:26:53.62 --> 02:26:54.90 permanent brain damage.
02:26:54.90 --> 02:27:08.82 The broken, I mean, he literally left everything in China. When he comes back, it takes months
02:27:08.82 --> 02:27:18.42 and months before he regains the sanity. But this whole theater of warfare was, I mean, mad.
02:27:18.42 --> 02:27:27.54 And it's just dealing with the Chinese on a daily basis. There are so many other people who tried
02:27:28.74 --> 02:27:33.30 Joe Stilwell tries to deal with China. I mean, he's frustrated. His entire war. He leaves
02:27:33.30 --> 02:27:40.10 not in disgrace but at least in massive frustration. Weedermire has the same headaches with the
02:27:40.10 --> 02:27:48.66 Chinese. But what still well and we tomorrow don't have to deal with is an oppressive army scrutiny.
02:27:48.66 --> 02:27:54.66 And when the army gets there, they see China as clearly their area of operations.
02:27:56.50 --> 02:28:02.50 And it is. I mean, they can't argue with it. I mean, it's a land. I mean, just like if the army
02:28:02.50 --> 02:28:06.98 decided that they were going to seize control of the South China Sea, then maybe we would
02:28:06.98 --> 02:28:11.38 certainly have something to say about it. Well, when they get there, the navy has this infrastructure
02:28:11.38 --> 02:28:19.38 in place and they don't know what to do with it. So they try to progressively take control of
02:28:20.34 --> 02:28:28.50 miles' organization. And in the end, miles loses out. The army takes control of it. And the only
02:28:28.50 --> 02:28:33.70 thing that stops them from really seizing control is all of the trouble that miles have had,
02:28:33.70 --> 02:28:38.50 which is geography. They can't see control of this thing. Miles maintains his command over his
02:28:38.50 --> 02:28:46.18 organization for the remainder of the war. So the problem is the solution. Yeah. Yeah. That's it.
02:28:47.22 --> 02:28:50.66 I got to mention this section here. At the time of the Japanese surrender,
02:28:51.06 --> 02:28:56.18 Rudy Bosch, a 17 year old volunteer with the amphibious Rogers, looked up from the middle of the
02:28:56.18 --> 02:29:02.18 training exercise in the Swamp's near Lake Oki Chobi to hear the class instructor. Now,
02:29:02.18 --> 02:29:06.50 stop what you're doing. The war is over. Told the return to Fort Pierce, Bosch and his
02:29:06.50 --> 02:29:11.46 classmates were then given a single final order tear it down. What followed was the sacking of
02:29:11.46 --> 02:29:16.58 three years' worth of construction. Mess halls, classrooms, offices, ranges, towers before a back
02:29:16.58 --> 02:29:21.54 drop of flaming white tents, tents that at once proudly lined the roads, sheltering the
02:29:21.54 --> 02:29:26.98 nearly every that nearly every special group in the US military from the Rangers to the UDTs,
02:29:27.38 --> 02:29:32.02 the Rogers, who had not gotten a crack at China, took out their frustrations by demolishing
02:29:32.02 --> 02:29:36.34 everything with their bare hands. By the end of the week, the only thing that suggested the past
02:29:36.34 --> 02:29:41.86 experience of a naval base was the pool, last to go with the men themselves. That's it. War is over.
02:29:45.86 --> 02:29:51.46 And with the the Rogers too. Yeah, we didn't even talk. What? Give us a quick brief on the Rogers.
02:29:51.46 --> 02:29:56.90 Well, the Rogers are the sort of the natural culmination of the Scouts and Rator program. So the
02:29:56.90 --> 02:30:05.62 Scouts and Rators, the names sort of doesn't make sense. I mean, the Scouts and Rators seem like they
02:30:05.62 --> 02:30:10.58 would be a reconnaissance troops and commandos. They really weren't. Scouts and Rators are a joint unit
02:30:10.58 --> 02:30:17.30 created at the very beginning of the war. It's an Army Navy unit. The idea is we need Army,
02:30:17.30 --> 02:30:26.02 Scout, Boat, Officers to take Army Beach marking troops ashore. So the Army can signal the landing
02:30:26.02 --> 02:30:30.98 fleet signal the landing craft so troops can get into the right beaches. This is what they do in
02:30:30.98 --> 02:30:36.26 North Africa. The problem is after North Africa, the Army start to lose interest in this. And
02:30:36.26 --> 02:30:42.42 there's they they stop creating their portion of the Scouts and Rators because they have
02:30:42.42 --> 02:30:47.54 they have enough beach marking troops for the remainder of the war. So they basically leave the
02:30:47.54 --> 02:30:52.02 the entire schoolhouse and the hands of the Navy, which you know now the Navy has all this
02:30:52.02 --> 02:30:56.50 curriculum and they have no prohibition on what the Navy's portion of the Scouts and Rator program can
02:30:56.50 --> 02:31:02.66 do. So naturally the Navy starts you know taking not just the the transportation side of the mission
02:31:02.66 --> 02:31:08.10 but they take the the entire beach marking side of the mission. So they have troops that are
02:31:08.10 --> 02:31:15.06 quasi you know commandos that are trained to do beach marking but you know at this point the war
02:31:15.06 --> 02:31:26.66 in 1945 when Soko has been created they realize that they can use these troops not just for
02:31:26.66 --> 02:31:31.70 beach marking anymore but for straight up command operations they have the Army's curriculum they
02:31:31.70 --> 02:31:38.66 have all the experience of working with army commandos so they train their sailors and everything
02:31:38.66 --> 02:31:44.50 of the army commandos have been trained with and the plan is to send these units to China and that's
02:31:44.50 --> 02:31:50.02 the amphibious Rogers. So the Scouts and Rators naturally I have a picture I think in the book of
02:31:51.14 --> 02:31:55.22 there's a sign you know says Scouts and Rators and then underneath that the amphibious Rodgers
02:31:55.22 --> 02:31:58.42 within months there's no more Scouts and Rators sign it's the amphibious Rogers.
02:32:01.54 --> 02:32:07.70 But not not the best name yeah for a commando unit but the idea was that you know these were
02:32:07.70 --> 02:32:12.42 the Navy's pirates you know the Rodgers or the Jolly Rodgers these guys are supposed to be the
02:32:12.42 --> 02:32:20.18 swaggering you know bushwackers the the Pacific. Chapter seven the US Navy's post war
02:32:20.18 --> 02:32:30.98 plight and the sailor Rators who led her back to significance in Korea again there's just so much
02:32:30.98 --> 02:32:37.14 detail that you put into this it's absolutely fascinating to read. He ended up highlighting now
02:32:37.14 --> 02:32:44.98 we're in a fast forward to where in Korea target baker. This time the Scouts were accompanied by a
02:32:44.98 --> 02:32:49.70 boatload of Marines who upon landing established a hasty perimeter then flashed seaword
02:32:49.70 --> 02:32:54.10 the signal for all clear when the remaining boats hit the shore the marine secured a beach head
02:32:54.10 --> 02:32:59.86 then scouted inland for the tunnel entrance as they did two trains appeared and did the job for
02:32:59.86 --> 02:33:05.46 them revealing the location of the two rail tunnels to the southernmost the Scouts put to flight
02:33:05.46 --> 02:33:10.66 one century armed with nothing but a wooden rifle and a bayonet. After securing the southern tunnel
02:33:10.66 --> 02:33:17.14 the UDT swimmers slagged some 2,000 pounds of explosives 300 yards past the beach where they
02:33:17.14 --> 02:33:24.98 stacked pack after pack into the tunnel's mouth and under a bridge. A 0 305 the UDT swimmers pulled their
02:33:24.98 --> 02:33:31.30 fuses initiating a hasty six minute retreat to the beach and the boats followed by a concert of
02:33:31.30 --> 02:33:38.82 Ours through the surf at 330 noted the task force diary charges exploded 20 minutes later the
02:33:38.82 --> 02:33:44.58 men of sag climbed back into the bat into the bass which was the ship and into history as the
02:33:44.58 --> 02:33:51.62 Navy's first successful Raiders of the modern area era for joy and for many of the Navy planners
02:33:51.62 --> 02:33:58.26 it was just a start. Yeah that was a tough chapter sorry that was a tough chapter to sort of figure out
02:33:58.26 --> 02:34:03.62 what we're the center of gravity of this thing is like what because the I mean just the the number
02:34:03.62 --> 02:34:09.46 of Raider organizations that the Navy sponsors during this period they sponsor the Marine Corps
02:34:09.46 --> 02:34:17.78 UDT group which is the special operations group at the time the sag they sponsor UDT led British
02:34:17.78 --> 02:34:25.14 commandos they sponsor army Raiders they I mean everybody is trying to figure out how to you know
02:34:25.14 --> 02:34:32.10 do sort of what the Koreans were doing to the US military at that point which is bottled up in
02:34:32.10 --> 02:34:38.66 the Poo-Song perimeter it's like you know we've been watching a Poo-Song perimeter moment in Afghanistan
02:34:38.66 --> 02:34:49.94 there lack of leadership lack of planning lack of resourcing you know forces army are the
02:34:49.94 --> 02:34:55.14 US forces back into this the small pocket and they're doing everything they can to sort of not necessarily
02:34:55.14 --> 02:35:01.94 break out of it but at least you know not do nothing and the not doing nothing is trying to
02:35:03.06 --> 02:35:09.46 cut the North Koreans supply lines and and the one advantage that they have when the with the
02:35:09.46 --> 02:35:14.82 Korean Peninsula is all of these arteries all these roads because of the the spine of the the North
02:35:14.82 --> 02:35:20.82 Korean Geography is they push everything to the to the edges of the peninsula so this is the first
02:35:20.82 --> 02:35:25.46 time the Navy really sees you know this huge opportunity to start you know sponsoring raids
02:35:25.46 --> 02:35:32.66 ashore that's the first time that the UDT which is the only special operations unit that survives
02:35:32.66 --> 02:35:38.74 disbandment in World War II that's the that's the moment that they cease to be just beach marking
02:35:38.74 --> 02:35:43.78 or just reconnaissance troops and demolition troops and they start going ashore but they you know
02:35:43.78 --> 02:35:49.14 like every other instance they are going ashore not alone they're going ashore with the Marines
02:35:49.14 --> 02:35:56.82 with British commandos C.I. operatives partisans and they're slowly learning this trade.
02:36:00.26 --> 02:36:07.94 You go into a chapter eight here tells another story of the Rangers and the army resurrection of
02:36:07.94 --> 02:36:15.78 the army Rangers and the guerilla raid that failed to first all their second death just just another
02:36:15.78 --> 02:36:26.10 one of these you got a guy named John Hugh McGee these characters all of them they're freaking epic
02:36:26.10 --> 02:36:38.02 I mean what this guy did is just incredible his career you look at these guys career
02:36:40.02 --> 02:36:46.98 and some and I mean at least in John McGee's case I mean he he's a totally I mean he maybe has the
02:36:46.98 --> 02:36:52.02 worst world war to experience of anybody let me just jump into that real quick um a year later
02:36:52.02 --> 02:36:56.34 McGee was at the epicenter of history hopefully c Commanding Moro troops and the Philippines against
02:36:56.34 --> 02:37:02.50 Japanese bombers in the snake choked malaria hills around Del Monte field Del Monte Airfield
02:37:03.30 --> 02:37:10.02 at kilometer 117 of the Sair Highway becoming the only American of the 11 who fought to
02:37:10.02 --> 02:37:16.58 there to survive the war after six months of resistance on May 10th 1942 McGee swallid is
02:37:16.58 --> 02:37:22.50 pride obeyed his superior and with a humiliating blindfolded salute surrendered himself and as
02:37:22.50 --> 02:37:28.34 American and Filipino troops to an imperial Japanese officer wearing a kimono many of the Filipinos
02:37:28.34 --> 02:37:33.86 were tied to stakes shot and buried in pits the Japanese soldiers never bothering to confirm they were dead
02:37:33.86 --> 02:37:41.30 at 33 McGee's dark brown hair had already faded into an iron gray for the next 25 months
02:37:41.30 --> 02:37:48.26 McGee survived beatings trench foot dysentery malaria mosquitoes cages and slavery for nourishment
02:37:48.26 --> 02:37:52.50 he and his fellow prisoners were fed a meager died of rice and a few vegetables that occasionally
02:37:52.50 --> 02:37:58.66 included yams dog meat wafer thing candy bars and cigarettes the last two purchase with a monthly
02:37:58.66 --> 02:38:04.10 allotment of 40 pesos that the Japanese could turn into a lever to pry prisoners submission
02:38:04.10 --> 02:38:09.30 so sensitive to the men become to their hunger that when fearful of transfer they gorge themselves
02:38:09.30 --> 02:38:14.98 on every scrap they had hidden one man even devouring a litter of puppies born the same day
02:38:16.10 --> 02:38:21.38 along with his Catholic faith to which he cleaved McGee sustained his mind on a series of escape
02:38:21.38 --> 02:38:26.58 plans into the Philippine jungle even making use of a urinary track infection that kept him
02:38:26.58 --> 02:38:33.70 up at night to memorize the guide posts of the constellations to each plan was attached in obvious
02:38:33.70 --> 02:38:41.94 colorec colore obvious to him anyways once escaped he would raise and lead an army of Filipino
02:38:41.94 --> 02:38:47.62 gorillas against the Japanese for two years he plotted mentally choosing men for work details not
02:38:47.62 --> 02:38:52.74 for strength but for the knowledge and gunnerian logistics men around whom he could build the
02:38:52.74 --> 02:38:57.94 gorilla army in his mind on the night of June 12 two years one month and two days after his
02:38:57.94 --> 02:39:03.22 capture he finally got his chance while anchored off the east coast of Zambuanga peninsula
02:39:03.22 --> 02:39:09.14 on a prison transfer ship McGee pommed off his rose rebeats to a friend dropped every stitch of his
02:39:09.14 --> 02:39:14.50 ragged clothing to the deck then tiptoed over his sleeping comrades placed a naked foot on top
02:39:14.50 --> 02:39:19.62 of the railing and dove into the racing current through an initial volley of the through an
02:39:19.62 --> 02:39:24.82 initial volley of bullets and passed two other prison ships McGee drifted from miles until rescued by
02:39:24.82 --> 02:39:32.74 a native by a native in an outrigger who paddled him to land gave Matisha which McGee turned into a
02:39:32.74 --> 02:39:38.10 loincloth a sure two native boys eventually found fed and clothed and tied to undersigned sneakers
02:39:38.10 --> 02:39:43.22 to the bottom of his feet like heelless slippers then pushed and pulled his amaciated frame
02:39:43.22 --> 02:39:48.98 over jungle trails lit by nothing more than a torch as bright as a cigar tip and you go on
02:39:48.98 --> 02:39:54.74 from there but just you have to kind of realize what's happening. Where this guy came from
02:39:54.74 --> 02:40:02.74 and what he wants. Yeah he spends the entire war you know essentially just neutralized. Yeah
02:40:02.74 --> 02:40:07.86 well it's so he's in prison camp for two years when he finally escapes he wants to go run a run
02:40:07.86 --> 02:40:12.98 up freaking an army a gorilla army well there's other people that already been running a gorilla
02:40:12.98 --> 02:40:17.30 army and they and now they outrank him they have the experience it's so he kind of gets sideline all
02:40:17.30 --> 02:40:26.10 time is wars just a series of disciplines. Yeah so he and and when he gets back home you know to
02:40:26.10 --> 02:40:31.62 finally meets the daughter that his wife meets he meets his daughter he was never met before
02:40:31.62 --> 02:40:38.42 and his reaction is immediately to volunteer for service back in the in the Pacific theater
02:40:38.42 --> 02:40:44.02 and the day he gets back the day he takes command of his troops they drop the drop the bomb
02:40:44.02 --> 02:40:50.74 and the entire time I mean that he's been you know neutralizes entire time facing the series of
02:40:50.74 --> 02:40:57.78 disbandments his little brother has been one of Marl's Marl's Marauders most effective
02:40:57.78 --> 02:41:04.50 of Italian commanders which is a really frustrating thing. So the psychology behind that.
02:41:04.50 --> 02:41:10.50 Yeah so when he finally gets to Korea and you know he has this new opportunity to prove himself
02:41:10.50 --> 02:41:16.98 all he wants to do is create the you know the the army that he had built in his mind and he gets
02:41:16.98 --> 02:41:25.54 there and or anyway you have the there's a there's a there's a it's so they go they end up
02:41:25.54 --> 02:41:30.02 he ends up putting together kind of a group mages Rangers is that correct accurate sameman.
02:41:30.02 --> 02:41:38.66 I mean he he's the he's the indispensable person when it comes to army special operations in Korea
02:41:38.66 --> 02:41:43.54 everything sort of flows out of him. He has all these ideas at the beginning of the war and he
02:41:43.54 --> 02:41:51.22 puts them all in writing and so everything from the army Rangers are reconstituted based off
02:41:51.22 --> 02:41:56.58 of his recommendations. The partisan command is created based off of his recommendations
02:41:57.30 --> 02:42:01.78 and he wants to sort of combine these these units together. He's got this idea it's sort of
02:42:01.78 --> 02:42:09.22 unformed it's not it's not exactly what you know it's not a mature idea. It's the beginning of the
02:42:09.22 --> 02:42:13.46 war it becomes you know you you see when you when you look through the structure of the
02:42:13.46 --> 02:42:19.70 institution that he had sort of created you see like like a siege a soda of like the
02:42:19.70 --> 02:42:25.30 comes tone in certain areas there like you can see and and every time that he constitutes this thing
02:42:25.30 --> 02:42:30.90 he the navy is a critical part of his ideas you can't do any of the types of things that he wants
02:42:30.90 --> 02:42:38.26 to do unless you have significant navy support navy transports anyway so the problem is you know
02:42:38.90 --> 02:42:46.02 the the army has moved be at move past all of his ideas they you know they they entertain him
02:42:46.02 --> 02:42:52.98 they entertain these ideas for a period and as you see throughout his service the army plucks
02:42:52.98 --> 02:42:58.34 these things off the table one at a time leaving him to go back to you know the states not in
02:42:58.34 --> 02:43:05.14 disgrace but not not to fulfill the thing that he wants he got these he's got these Ranger groups
02:43:05.14 --> 02:43:09.38 together again and here's a here's a section where the Rangers are his some of his mages Rangers are
02:43:09.38 --> 02:43:13.22 going out they're on an operation I'm going to jump into the middle of this operation after a moment
02:43:13.22 --> 02:43:18.58 of intense argument Watson ordered back one of the Koreans they had left the radio Watson ordered
02:43:18.58 --> 02:43:23.94 back one of the Koreans Koreans to get the radio who not surprisingly refused until Watson threatened
02:43:23.94 --> 02:43:28.82 to beat the man himself scrambling to the clearing the Korean soldiers seize the radio by the back
02:43:28.82 --> 02:43:32.98 strap then dragged it behind him bouncing rolling smashing over rocks and leaving the trail of
02:43:32.98 --> 02:43:38.82 broken knobs handles and antenna bastards got his brains in his ass see the Watson as he watched
02:43:38.82 --> 02:43:44.02 when the runner reached the trees and present the radio everyone could see that it was destroyed
02:43:44.02 --> 02:43:49.06 with their only hope for survival buoyed upon the ability to communicate their position to the
02:43:49.06 --> 02:43:53.78 Navy's fighters and helicopters the radio's destruction meant Virginia that's the name of the team
02:43:53.78 --> 02:44:00.82 Virginia's was not far behind had Watson wanted to repay this cruelty and kind his rage was
02:44:00.82 --> 02:44:06.66 instantly short circuited by the shredding sound of a machine gun fire and the terror of communist
02:44:06.66 --> 02:44:12.90 soldiers lunging across the body strewn clearing without a word as Thornton recalled the Virginia
02:44:12.90 --> 02:44:20.50 survivors plunged into the trees and creed down the hill in a wild melee stumbling rising
02:44:20.50 --> 02:44:24.98 running and falling again hoping with every bruise to break through to the valley floor before
02:44:24.98 --> 02:44:29.54 the enemy since the news around their necks after running for what seemed like a half a mile
02:44:29.54 --> 02:44:35.46 the men collapse into the relative protection and shadow of a ravine as their lungs pump
02:44:35.46 --> 02:44:40.98 pump to miniature fog banks into the cold air their ears caught the growing but unmistakable home
02:44:40.98 --> 02:44:46.10 of hum and chop of two helicopters echoing through the valley when the first helicopter made it
02:44:46.10 --> 02:44:51.14 back to the clearing its pilot aged into a hover kicked out a bundle of supplies then leaned
02:44:51.14 --> 02:44:57.46 out as window coming face to face with a volley of muzzle flashes banking hard the pilot escaped
02:44:57.46 --> 02:45:03.78 and ambush the ambush only barely with the clearing obviously overrun both pilots roared
02:45:03.78 --> 02:45:09.06 their helicopters into an anxious racetrack search around the mountains flying so low that
02:45:09.06 --> 02:45:14.58 Thornton could easily make out each pilot's face without a radio even without even marking
02:45:14.58 --> 02:45:21.70 panels the Virginia survivors waved frantic arms but betrayed not a sound since any noise
02:45:21.70 --> 02:45:27.62 would only alert their hunters not the engine def in the pilots for 30 or so minutes the pilot
02:45:27.62 --> 02:45:32.74 searched then ascended and retrace their path through the ocean Virginia was alone
02:45:32.74 --> 02:45:38.42 except for the blowing wind and the rustle of the leafless trees remembered forten
02:45:39.62 --> 02:45:46.98 there was silence lonely empty silence they they go on the run you you highlight you
02:45:46.98 --> 02:45:50.74 you go through some of that and then finally fast forward a little bit on April 10th 10
02:45:50.74 --> 02:45:55.62 hallucinatory days since the mountain top battle and just two to three miles from U.N. lines
02:45:55.62 --> 02:46:02.02 the last remaining members of Virginia mission were cornered in a cave captured and ransacked
02:46:02.02 --> 02:46:07.38 then beaten and bound with wire so tightly that Watson's arms soon swelled to twice their normal
02:46:07.38 --> 02:46:13.94 size for the second time in his life this veteran of the Darby's Rangers was a prisoner of war
02:46:13.94 --> 02:46:19.54 as fate would have it captured while escaping from a disaster as consequential for the Rangers as
02:46:19.54 --> 02:46:27.54 Sisturnah had been and this guy Watson you you you you introduce him later and you have to get the
02:46:27.54 --> 02:46:34.42 book to see what this guy's about but let me give you a little something so this guy gets captured
02:46:34.42 --> 02:46:41.30 in the 29 months since his capture, Corporal Martin R. Watson a soldier no guard or prisoner believed
02:46:41.30 --> 02:46:46.98 was actually a corporal had set an example for captivity that to this day was has never been
02:46:46.98 --> 02:46:53.62 exceeded 30 days after he was captured for 18 of which he had been starved in a cave to make
02:46:53.62 --> 02:47:00.26 his 240 pound size somewhat easier to handle Watson and a South Korean comrade had knocked out a
02:47:00.26 --> 02:47:04.82 guard with a rock and made for the surrounding mountains where they had survived for five days
02:47:04.82 --> 02:47:10.58 until their pursuers had disabled them by rolling or grenade into their hideout. Never medically
02:47:10.58 --> 02:47:16.18 treated except with some shreds of brown paper to cover his wound wounds Watson had nevertheless
02:47:16.18 --> 02:47:21.30 escaped again this time by wriggling out of his rope restraints and jumping free of a moving
02:47:21.30 --> 02:47:27.30 truck as it slowed around a bend. This time he survived a week before inadvertently walking right past
02:47:27.30 --> 02:47:33.62 a wide-eyed North Korean patrol. For these attempts and one other plus an attempt that suicide
02:47:33.62 --> 02:47:38.66 with a piece of broken glass he had been relentlessly beaten with rifle butts and boot heels
02:47:38.66 --> 02:47:46.74 and periodically starved and always almost always isolated once in an unsheltered hole for 72 days
02:47:46.74 --> 02:47:54.90 with rations described by the record as sparse. Rightly suspected as an OSS spy and sabotour,
02:47:54.90 --> 02:48:00.82 Watson had also been subjected to almost daily interrogation by North Koreans, Chinese, and even
02:48:00.82 --> 02:48:07.62 Russians who had drilled him on his exposure to the Gestapo in World War II but especially on the
02:48:07.62 --> 02:48:12.98 organization's methods and tactics of the peritube unit to which they knew he belonged.
02:48:12.98 --> 02:48:20.02 Watson's response to these and other questions had been a mixture of stony silence or intentional
02:48:20.02 --> 02:48:25.94 contradiction responses that had invariably earned him a switch across the eyes, a pistol barrel
02:48:25.94 --> 02:48:31.94 across the face or hours of kneeling with his nose pressed against a wall and then a stone on his head.
02:48:33.62 --> 02:48:38.42 Throughout these deprivations Watson had never lost his bearing or conviction,
02:48:38.42 --> 02:48:44.74 one standing during a packed camp lecture by a British speaker from the London daily worker
02:48:44.74 --> 02:48:48.34 to say that he didn't know what communism was and he didn't care to find out.
02:48:50.18 --> 02:48:55.54 Nor did he and his fellow POWs want to listen to this traitor,
02:48:55.54 --> 02:49:03.78 Kami Son of a bitch. For this affront and as is an example to other prisoners he was eventually
02:49:03.78 --> 02:49:10.90 frog marched before a military tribunal informed of the armistice then sentenced to death by firing
02:49:10.90 --> 02:49:21.06 squad. He still didn't talk. In the end after having been starved from 240 pounds to 120,
02:49:21.86 --> 02:49:28.50 his was an example that earned him the final distinction as the second to last UN POW to be released
02:49:28.50 --> 02:49:35.62 across the freedom bridge. On the other side he learned that the Rangers he had so steadfastly
02:49:35.62 --> 02:49:43.62 protected from exposure no longer existed. As far removed now from the army's interest as was the
02:49:43.62 --> 02:49:49.22 man who had resurrected them from the grave, a man whose accomplishments had disappointingly
02:49:49.22 --> 02:49:56.66 matched those of his past. About the same time that Operation Spitfire had been unraveling
02:49:56.66 --> 02:50:03.38 Colonel John Humege, the Korean War author of the army Rangers and Korean partisans
02:50:03.38 --> 02:50:08.26 had presented himself for the third time to the Quanson Hut maze of the eight armies headquarters
02:50:08.26 --> 02:50:13.62 in Pusan intent on securing a date for a partisan advance in a North Korea, a date for which he had
02:50:13.62 --> 02:50:19.70 long been waiting. The reply from his superior had been simple, never.
02:50:21.54 --> 02:50:26.02 After a year-long tour, McGee left Korea's ejected as he had left the Philippines,
02:50:26.02 --> 02:50:30.26 never again to have a chance to lead a partisan army on a campaign of liberation.
02:50:31.70 --> 02:50:38.26 On top of everything else he was branded the scapegoat for the failure of Virginia and Spitfire
02:50:38.26 --> 02:50:41.94 failures with consequences beyond a battered reputation.
02:50:45.54 --> 02:50:53.94 Yeah, the way that the army is treating special operations in this period is
02:50:53.94 --> 02:51:00.18 similar to the way that they dealt with them in World War II. They are created the
02:51:00.18 --> 02:51:05.62 Rangers. They attach them to divisions for control. In each instance, the divisional commanders,
02:51:05.62 --> 02:51:09.22 they don't see much distinction between the Rangers and their own infantry. So they treat them
02:51:09.22 --> 02:51:16.34 like infantry. Usually they use them as their frontline infantry and predictably they get
02:51:16.34 --> 02:51:20.90 mauled and then the commanders justify their own belief that they were just like infantry.
02:51:20.90 --> 02:51:27.54 The only thing that really could have kept the Rangers or the army from disbanding them would have
02:51:27.54 --> 02:51:36.50 been the sort of raid that McGee sends Watson and his team to complete, which is a penetration rate,
02:51:38.50 --> 02:51:46.34 a deep penetration raid behind enemy lines to destroy a tunnel. For lots of reasons,
02:51:46.34 --> 02:51:53.94 the rug gets pulled out from under this team before they even go and their chances of success
02:51:53.94 --> 02:51:59.62 before they even launch are diminished and almost nothing. They still go and like you read the
02:51:59.62 --> 02:52:04.82 passage that you read, I mean the survival, the lengths that they go just to survive are incredible.
02:52:05.62 --> 02:52:11.62 And this mission is almost completely lost to history. I mean when I started researching that mission
02:52:11.62 --> 02:52:17.70 and researching Watson, I didn't have a lot to go on. There's really only a couple of accounts
02:52:17.70 --> 02:52:24.10 about it and I had based off of what I had done, the research I had done from my World War
02:52:24.10 --> 02:52:28.42 Two chapters. I sort of knew or I sort of suspected that there would be like some
02:52:29.46 --> 02:52:35.54 post POW report about Watson. Couldn't find it the first time I went to the archives, but
02:52:35.54 --> 02:52:42.26 I knew that these reports were roughly two pages. Whenever anybody was recovered from a POW
02:52:42.26 --> 02:52:47.14 camp, the military would interview them, they would put the circumstances, their capture,
02:52:47.78 --> 02:52:55.70 and the circumstances of their captivity in these reports and they lock it away in an archive someplace.
02:52:56.98 --> 02:53:03.78 So I knew that this report probably existed. So I contacted the archives, they confirmed that the report
02:53:03.78 --> 02:53:09.30 did exist and being an Illinois at the time it wasn't super convenient for me to go back.
02:53:09.30 --> 02:53:15.06 I expected that the two pages wouldn't provide a ton of detail anyway, but I asked them,
02:53:15.06 --> 02:53:20.66 could you take a look at it and then send me the pages that his report.
02:53:21.94 --> 02:53:25.86 The archive was kind enough to do it. She went and she looked at the account and she said,
02:53:25.86 --> 02:53:33.30 yeah, the accounts in a file labeled such and such is the record of American POWs in the
02:53:33.30 --> 02:53:38.50 Korean War, but it's 750 pages. So I can't scan it and copy it and send it to you.
02:53:38.50 --> 02:53:44.02 I was like, well, can you just find his section and send me those pages and she said, no, it's 750 pages.
02:53:44.02 --> 02:53:47.62 It's not been cleared. You'd have to put a FOIA request and just to go through it to make sure that
02:53:47.62 --> 02:53:52.98 there's no classified information. So I put the FOIA request in, they go through, but they still
02:53:52.98 --> 02:53:57.86 won't send me the two pages. Anyway, I sort of forget about it. I've sort of moved on to
02:53:57.86 --> 02:54:01.86 another chapter. I figure if I'm going to find anything on the Virginia one raid and it's going to
02:54:01.86 --> 02:54:06.90 be the center of gravity of that chapter. I'll find it eventually. But it's sort of like I said,
02:54:06.90 --> 02:54:12.66 I put it on the back burner. I've already moved on. So I come to the archive several months later.
02:54:12.66 --> 02:54:17.54 And I remember I put this FOIA request and so I do a double check on it. End of a long day.
02:54:17.54 --> 02:54:21.94 My back is aching because of all the pictures that I've taken. You have to stand over these
02:54:21.94 --> 02:54:26.50 tables and take picture after picture. When I leave the archive after a day of research,
02:54:26.50 --> 02:54:36.42 I've got like 3,000 images. It's not fun. But at the end of the day, I think I've got about 30 minutes
02:54:36.42 --> 02:54:41.38 left. I find the archive. I'm like, hey, can you find this report from me? I'd like to take a look
02:54:41.38 --> 02:54:49.70 at and see what it is. She comes back with the 750 pages. I opened it up. It's not 750 pages of
02:54:49.70 --> 02:54:57.14 American POWs in the Korean War. It's 750 pages on Martin Watson. And no one has ever gone through it.
02:54:58.10 --> 02:55:04.74 Not since the day that they took the reports and put it in the archive. And it is,
02:55:05.86 --> 02:55:11.38 it's a gold mine. I mean, it had everything from his police reports. The circumstances of his
02:55:11.38 --> 02:55:17.54 captivity in Sostana, because he was part of Darby's Rangers. And then the fact that this person,
02:55:17.54 --> 02:55:23.62 he's present, not just for the consequential moment of the Rangers in World War II, but the consequential
02:55:23.62 --> 02:55:30.18 moment of the Rangers in the Korean War. Man, it's amazing. Account after account of all of the people
02:55:30.18 --> 02:55:35.30 that it's not just his interview. It's not just his post-captivity interview that's in the 750
02:55:35.30 --> 02:55:41.38 pages. It's interview after interview by his fellow captives. And they all have the same story about this
02:55:41.38 --> 02:55:50.74 guy. He is incomparable. And he gets a bronze star. After his captivity. And he gets a promotion
02:55:50.74 --> 02:55:56.66 to Sergeant. I mean, I couldn't, I mean, maybe Freeman and some instance of maybe Halper and a
02:55:56.66 --> 02:56:01.54 couple of others. I mean, nobody that I come across in the writing of that book is more deserving
02:56:01.54 --> 02:56:07.38 of the Medal of Honor. I mean, the the lengths that he went to for his own, for his own men,
02:56:07.38 --> 02:56:12.74 on that hilltop in the Virginia one mission. And then the lengths that he goes to just to survive
02:56:12.74 --> 02:56:20.82 in the POW camps and into escape. Noomers escape perhaps. I mean, but yeah, he's, I mean,
02:56:20.82 --> 02:56:28.50 I do have your next book identified yet. I got a good idea. The problem with the the the the
02:56:28.50 --> 02:56:37.86 the record is that there's no dates. And I thought, you know, you could write a book about Martin
02:56:37.86 --> 02:56:43.06 Watson. I think you would have to make it fiction though. You'd have enough material to write that
02:56:43.06 --> 02:56:47.86 that book, but you couldn't write it with the same level of specificity that I wrote this.
02:56:47.86 --> 02:56:51.62 Because you need the chronology to tell that story and the chronology.
02:56:51.62 --> 02:56:56.42 Just you could piece together the chronology from the other events that he's actually in.
02:56:56.42 --> 02:57:01.06 You could, I thought about it and you would have to find you'd have to go through each of the reports
02:57:02.90 --> 02:57:09.06 and track down, you know, the, you know, the 150 guys and see who's still alive to see if they
02:57:09.06 --> 02:57:14.98 can put, you know, some chronology to it. You would, I don't know. I have, I've thought about it.
02:57:16.02 --> 02:57:20.02 What happened to him after the war? I have to get out of the army after he was in the military
02:57:20.02 --> 02:57:27.30 notoriously promoted to sergeant. Yeah, right. He is, it doesn't have the, it's, it's not the best
02:57:28.90 --> 02:57:35.14 epitaph. He's, he ends up having some trouble. I mean, like, like I write in the book,
02:57:35.14 --> 02:57:42.02 his interwar period between his release from the German POW camp in World War II and the
02:57:42.02 --> 02:57:48.02 his entrance back into the army. It's punctuated by some 76 arrests by the the Connecticut police.
02:57:48.02 --> 02:57:54.34 And yeah, ranging from fighting to drunkenness back to fighting to resisting arrest. I mean,
02:57:54.34 --> 02:57:59.78 he has no, I mean, he clearly has, you know, post-traumatic stress, but he is also, you know,
02:57:59.78 --> 02:58:04.82 that's just who he was. Just grown up in the sort of like rough and tumble gang type environment.
02:58:06.50 --> 02:58:13.06 And, you know, he's, you know, he would be a nightmare to command, but, you know, also, you know,
02:58:13.06 --> 02:58:21.86 in Compton Blown Combat. But after the war, he, he marries, doesn't, doesn't go well. He's,
02:58:21.86 --> 02:58:27.46 you know, completely, you know, broken from the war. He ends up having a couple of kids,
02:58:29.14 --> 02:58:36.42 and then moving to Alaska to work on a pipeline. His son, who I have become, you know, friends with,
02:58:36.42 --> 02:58:42.66 is, is, every bit as big as his old man was. I mean, he's, you know, he's just, you know,
02:58:42.66 --> 02:58:51.78 some equally a monster. But the nicest guy that he ever made. But he, I think he met his dad,
02:58:51.78 --> 02:58:58.34 you know, maybe two dozen times. And the course of his life. And then, his, he passes away, I believe,
02:58:58.34 --> 02:59:04.26 from lung cancer. He smoked his entire entire life. And the, the password that his son
02:59:04.26 --> 02:59:10.26 would have to use to get into his hospital room was courage. So,
02:59:17.38 --> 02:59:25.46 Korean war ends, your next section is Arleigh Burke, the Bay of Pigs, and the launching of the
02:59:25.46 --> 02:59:37.06 Navy's Limited War Seals. You talk about Arleigh here. During the period of the CIA's
02:59:37.06 --> 02:59:42.58 preparations for the covert invasion invasion of Cuba, the US Navy was led by Admiral Arleigh Burke.
02:59:43.62 --> 02:59:50.34 The 58-year-old CNO, whose most conspicuous feature were a tight shock of curly bleached air,
02:59:50.34 --> 02:59:57.78 a fist of a chin that fell into a loose and swollen neck and a sizable bulk that had long
02:59:57.78 --> 03:00:04.90 since settled into his hips, a trait that gave said one witness a C roll to his stride and
03:00:04.90 --> 03:00:13.38 adjoined his shape, the impression of an upright base or a freighter. So there you got Arleigh Burke.
03:00:14.98 --> 03:00:19.94 Not an attractive man. Yeah. And here's an important part. And this is one of the,
03:00:19.94 --> 03:00:25.62 one of the parts where we start connecting this DNA of the SEAL teams to the DNA of the US Navy.
03:00:25.62 --> 03:00:30.58 In 1943, when Burke finally arrived in the South Pacific to take command of destroyers,
03:00:30.58 --> 03:00:36.66 Guadgarine 23, Desaron 23, the little beavers, he pinned himself to a drop-leaf desk and a
03:00:36.66 --> 03:00:40.98 sweltering belly of his command ship and crammed into his head a year's worth of combat reports
03:00:40.98 --> 03:00:47.14 every battle from coral sea to sevo island. A poll that the micro management of destroyers
03:00:47.14 --> 03:00:54.74 in which the permission to launch torpedoes against an already discovered enemy fleet was denied for
03:00:54.74 --> 03:00:59.94 for four immutable minutes. Burke crafted an entirely new doctrine of employment.
03:01:00.66 --> 03:01:06.02 Instead of spreading his destroyers around the fleets larger ships as nighttime submer subrene
03:01:06.02 --> 03:01:11.14 packets all dependent on permission from above to break guard duty to engage the enemy.
03:01:11.14 --> 03:01:16.98 Burke proposed to concentrate his ships at the head of the fleet and to govern his
03:01:16.98 --> 03:01:24.74 skippers, skippers under what has since been called the doctrine of faith. An unprecedented
03:01:24.74 --> 03:01:30.42 delegation of authority in which an enemy sighting would be immediately followed by a coordinated
03:01:30.42 --> 03:01:38.50 torpedo attack without orders. The use of all caps was Burke's to convey this attitude to his sailors,
03:01:38.50 --> 03:01:44.10 Burke issued them a 12 page, Mimeographed memo, whose very first lines read,
03:01:44.10 --> 03:01:50.34 if it will help kill japs, it's important. If it would not help kill japs, it's not important.
03:01:51.06 --> 03:01:58.74 Keep your ship trained for battle. Burke's list of non-battle-related orders was succinct.
03:01:58.74 --> 03:02:03.70 There were none. Corrections to this section will not be permitted.
03:02:03.70 --> 03:02:14.58 It took less than a month to make his point. That's Burke. You go through this thing and Burke
03:02:14.58 --> 03:02:21.78 is running the Navy and clearly he's an aggressive guy and believes in decentralized command.
03:02:23.62 --> 03:02:30.10 You do a great job of covering what happened at the Bay of Pigs, how that ties into our history
03:02:30.10 --> 03:02:38.18 and the seal teams. Pretty interesting story the way that unfolds. It ends up with
03:02:40.26 --> 03:02:45.54 a horrible situation, but we do gain some experience and we work with some of these
03:02:45.54 --> 03:02:54.18 cubanationalists that helped us out as well. This is the toughest chapter. Each of the chapters
03:02:54.18 --> 03:02:58.90 presented various challenges when it came to researching and trying to craft the narrative
03:02:58.90 --> 03:03:07.94 or trying to figure out what's the point of this chapter and how does this serve the story?
03:03:07.94 --> 03:03:15.78 Or how does this push us forward? What aspects of Burke's personality or Burke's own history?
03:03:16.50 --> 03:03:23.38 How is that relevant? You hit the nail right on the head when it comes to Burke's
03:03:23.38 --> 03:03:29.30 emphasis on latitude and decentralized command. Other thing about Burke that's really important
03:03:29.30 --> 03:03:36.50 or that's essential about him is that he refuses to allow the other branches of service to define
03:03:36.50 --> 03:03:44.26 what the Navy is. The revolt of the animals are in that period during the interwar period
03:03:44.26 --> 03:03:48.66 between World War II and the Korean War. The other branches of the service are trying to tell the Navy
03:03:48.66 --> 03:03:57.14 that we need to really de-arm ourselves and become more of a merchant marine which to Burke is a
03:03:57.14 --> 03:04:03.62 nantama. He has no interest in commanding a Navy that's just a support or a transport unit.
03:04:04.66 --> 03:04:12.18 To Burke, the Navy is nothing if it's not an instrument of offensive warfare. He's constantly
03:04:12.18 --> 03:04:17.46 when he becomes the Siano and he becomes the Siano for a period longer than even the
03:04:17.46 --> 03:04:22.74 closest competitor. It's a normally a two-year job. He's the Siano for six years.
03:04:23.78 --> 03:04:29.62 No one has the influence on the U.S. Navy that Arleigh Burke does. So when he becomes the Siano
03:04:30.66 --> 03:04:35.62 constantly, the entire time he's constantly looking for opportunities to push the Navy
03:04:35.62 --> 03:04:43.30 into a more offensive role. So he champions this limited war capability. He sees enemies all over the
03:04:43.30 --> 03:04:49.22 globe and he's trying to figure out how the Navy can either bring forces to bear launch
03:04:49.22 --> 03:05:00.10 marine launch missiles, launch naval gunfire and that orientation ultimately creates this unit.
03:05:02.10 --> 03:05:10.50 But like I said, writing the book creates, you know, present structuring and research challenges,
03:05:10.50 --> 03:05:16.10 you know, every chapter is hard to write. This chapter though, this was probably the easiest
03:05:16.10 --> 03:05:22.90 chapter when it came to write the first draft because there's been so much produced about
03:05:22.90 --> 03:05:29.62 Arleigh Burke. Numerous books, a couple of pretty good with lots and lots of corroborative detail in
03:05:29.62 --> 03:05:34.82 them and then, you know, just finding, you know, his fingerprints all over those documents,
03:05:34.82 --> 03:05:39.38 the create the seal teams, they're all over. I mean, everything, all the, all the documents that
03:05:39.38 --> 03:05:44.18 his office is creating, but then you can see his little scratches and his pen scratches and all these
03:05:44.18 --> 03:05:48.98 documents because he writes with, I think it's a green pen and you can see him still on the documents
03:05:48.98 --> 03:05:56.98 when you go to the the Navy yard today. The problem with this chapter, the Dick of the Bay of Pigspart
03:05:56.98 --> 03:06:00.74 is just finding the material because it's, you know, the CIA still involved and, you know,
03:06:00.74 --> 03:06:05.06 I can't tell you how many times I tried to get documents out of the CIA, it's a black hole.
03:06:05.06 --> 03:06:11.14 You just can't get them. So I finally was able to track down the actual Cuban frogmen that
03:06:12.42 --> 03:06:17.06 the participated in the raid and all of them were just, you know, totally generous with their
03:06:17.06 --> 03:06:21.30 time. So, you know, the book is written almost sequentially. There's a couple of chapters that I wrote
03:06:21.30 --> 03:06:25.86 out of order, but this chapter in particular is the one that just sort of kept me up at night until
03:06:25.86 --> 03:06:30.34 the end. She's like, I know there's more material out there and I've got to get it into the book
03:06:30.34 --> 03:06:36.58 and I mean, short of going down to Miami and meeting with the actual, or because I closely
03:06:36.58 --> 03:06:42.26 using it and they close the bad big news amp, but I managed to find them and their accounts are in there.
03:06:42.98 --> 03:06:50.02 Yeah, it's an epic epic retelling of that. Again, that's why you got to get this book to read these
03:06:50.02 --> 03:06:57.30 sections because I'm not covered at all today. But we do get Kennedy, we get Kennedy who now is
03:06:57.30 --> 03:07:02.82 really focused on this idea, the small war idea, the counter insurgency idea, the guerilla war for
03:07:02.82 --> 03:07:08.66 idea. He's all over it. He starts pushing people in that direction. He needs someone to run
03:07:09.38 --> 03:07:13.94 the special warfare center at Fort Bragg, where's the where the green berets come from, where they get
03:07:13.94 --> 03:07:21.86 this like their schoolhouse. He ends up talking one of his friends, his one of his military aids
03:07:21.86 --> 03:07:29.86 who recommends a guy to run it. This guy named Colonel Bill Yarbrough, who's another character in
03:07:29.86 --> 03:07:37.22 the story. At the change of command ceremony, his soldiers observed him as he was, average size,
03:07:37.22 --> 03:07:42.66 chest out, shoulders back, a rooster of a man, his narrowed eyes and purse lifts locked into a
03:07:42.66 --> 03:07:47.86 stoic gaze as revealing as a Roman bust. Son of an army colon colonel, married to an army
03:07:47.86 --> 03:07:52.58 brat with a son on his way to an army commission and two daughters on their way to army husbands.
03:07:52.58 --> 03:07:58.74 Yarbrough was the very picture of army tradition. 48 years old now in press slacks and blouse boots
03:07:58.74 --> 03:08:04.66 with no prior special, no prior experience in special forces, nothing on the surface seemed to indicate
03:08:04.66 --> 03:08:09.38 anything besides a conventional background and a preference for more of the same. But that was just
03:08:09.38 --> 03:08:15.62 the surface. Beneath his obvious soldierly bearing was hidden an ambition for a military organization
03:08:15.62 --> 03:08:21.70 as unconventional as had ever existed, born into a military family and predictably funneled into
03:08:21.70 --> 03:08:26.58 a West Point education, where his only step out of formation seems to have been as a cartoonist
03:08:26.58 --> 03:08:32.82 on the school newspaper. Yarbrough's early army career was in fact a litany of non-conformities,
03:08:32.82 --> 03:08:37.62 four years with the Philippine scouts, one of the most unconventional assignments in the US army.
03:08:37.62 --> 03:08:44.02 Two years as a parachute test officer during which his creativity had burst open as wide as
03:08:44.02 --> 03:08:49.70 the thing he was testing. This had manifested in everything from redesigning the parachute
03:08:49.70 --> 03:08:55.62 press pants to boots, to promoting his untested unit by acting as a stunt double for a Hollywood
03:08:55.62 --> 03:09:02.42 movie for which he was afterwards afterward nicknamed Show Biz. And in creating a silver badge
03:09:02.42 --> 03:09:07.46 that looked like an ice cream comb shaped parachute flexed with winged angels that was ultimately
03:09:07.46 --> 03:09:13.46 adopted as the symbol for the entire airborne. In World War II Yarbrough survived incomparible
03:09:13.46 --> 03:09:20.02 five combat jumps, five camp pains, two combat commands, one of which had fought alongside
03:09:20.02 --> 03:09:26.50 Darby's Rangers at Sistarna and later earned a presidential unit citation and one crash landing.
03:09:26.50 --> 03:09:31.14 And except for a brief sidelining resulting from an outburst against his division commander
03:09:31.14 --> 03:09:36.66 Matthew Ridgeway, it was an almost unblemished record of direct action with a record,
03:09:36.66 --> 03:09:42.26 a record with honor so compelling that any normal soldier would have coveted its repetition.
03:09:42.26 --> 03:09:49.30 Yarbrough wasn't normal. What was the outburst about Ridgeway? Remember?
03:09:51.06 --> 03:09:59.14 Yeah, I'm trying to think it was it was an airant drop. I believe in Italy.
03:10:00.66 --> 03:10:05.54 An airant drop of the parachute troopers or an airant drop of a bomb from the fire situation.
03:10:05.54 --> 03:10:11.14 No of paratroopers. Okay. Yeah, they landed them in a place that they shouldn't have landed them and
03:10:11.14 --> 03:10:17.38 he returned from that and he does something that you just can't do in the army. He, you know,
03:10:17.38 --> 03:10:22.74 let's as boss have it. Matthew Ridgeway is not. Matthew Ridgeway is another hero of the story,
03:10:22.74 --> 03:10:26.82 but you know, maybe not hero of the story. He's a hero of an American hero,
03:10:26.82 --> 03:10:32.10 but he's an executioner of the Rangers in Korea, but he's also the executioner of Yarbrough's
03:10:32.10 --> 03:10:39.30 sort of rise to infantry or paratrooper greatness. He shortsurcuses career, sends him back to the
03:10:39.30 --> 03:10:44.18 states. I think the only way that Yarbrough gets back into command is through a Mark Clark.
03:10:46.02 --> 03:10:52.98 But yeah, it was, um, yeah, Yarbrough. Yarbrough, Yarbrough. He is a,
03:10:56.50 --> 03:11:04.66 probably next to Kaufman. I don't think I met anybody who was, his toughness just sort of pinned
03:11:04.66 --> 03:11:11.14 down. Like, what does he want? Because I mean, his, his whole background seems to imply that he's,
03:11:11.14 --> 03:11:16.18 you know, just this conventional, you know, soldier, but he has no interest in it. And I,
03:11:16.18 --> 03:11:21.70 you know, that I, I couldn't find, you know, the letter, the document, uh, to, you know, suggest,
03:11:21.70 --> 03:11:27.22 you know, why he, um, was sort of turning his back on that and why he, you know, bought in so,
03:11:27.22 --> 03:11:33.06 you know, full heartedly to this idea of counter insurgency, but nevertheless it's there. He
03:11:33.06 --> 03:11:39.22 becomes the biggest, uh, disciple or a passallor, whatever you want to call him, of counter insurgency,
03:11:39.22 --> 03:11:44.34 of, you know, winning, uh, you know, the, the, the, the hearts and minds of the people,
03:11:44.90 --> 03:11:49.62 and then turning them or at least denying them to the enemy. And, uh, the way that you did that
03:11:49.62 --> 03:11:55.30 is not through combat. It's through all the stuff that nobody likes to do. It's digging well.
03:11:55.30 --> 03:12:00.18 Yeah, digging it. It becomes real obvious, you see, here, Yarbrough's first action is commander
03:12:00.18 --> 03:12:04.02 of the Naval Special Warfare Center and top train of special forces was to initiate a top to
03:12:04.02 --> 03:12:08.26 bottom of a view of training and curriculum and effort to match his men with their mission.
03:12:08.26 --> 03:12:13.22 So here we go into fast forward a little bit before along, the special warfare center began to feel
03:12:13.22 --> 03:12:18.34 less like a command, of course, and more like a college campus complete with courses in bridge building,
03:12:18.34 --> 03:12:24.10 sanitation, animal husbandry, axmithing, crop raising, pig pen construction, swine and
03:12:24.10 --> 03:12:30.34 occupation, leaflet creation, field irrigation, seed planning and rice cultivation. Not all of
03:12:30.34 --> 03:12:34.26 Yarbrough and, and, of course, there's resistance. Not all of Yarbrough staff are proof of the changes.
03:12:34.26 --> 03:12:40.02 Particularly said Yarbrough, the old jockstrap commandos, the Ranger types, gallant bloodletters
03:12:40.02 --> 03:12:44.34 and fighting machines to be sure about men who are anything but diplomats and rejected any
03:12:44.34 --> 03:12:49.70 suggestion that they ought to be. They were he continued men devoid of the more humane qualities,
03:12:49.70 --> 03:12:54.42 compassion, pity and mercy, men who bristle that the idea of lying on their bellies to teach
03:12:54.42 --> 03:13:00.18 and illiterate tribes and in on how to aim a rifle. So he's got a totally different idea of
03:13:00.90 --> 03:13:08.34 really what the green berets should be. And he's got another little, he's got another
03:13:08.34 --> 03:13:12.26 little different opinion too. Here fast forward a little bit to convert his men to his new
03:13:12.26 --> 03:13:18.58 philosophy as warfare. My religion, he would one day call it in which battles, the battles objective
03:13:18.58 --> 03:13:23.78 was not the destruction of the enemy of an enemy's army but the winning of indigenous minds and
03:13:23.78 --> 03:13:29.62 sympathies. That must be the precursor of hearts and minds. Yarbrough enjoyed every one of his
03:13:29.62 --> 03:13:34.98 officers above the rank of captain to accompany him into the pine berets for what he called
03:13:34.98 --> 03:13:41.06 his talk in the woods. As long as I am charged of special forces, he would say there will be no
03:13:41.06 --> 03:13:46.82 womanizing, no drunkenness, no wild parties, no adultery. There'll be no trouble makers, no wild
03:13:46.82 --> 03:13:53.30 men. That stuff is out. There will be moral standards, disciplinary standards, apparent standards.
03:13:53.30 --> 03:13:57.54 The rules are going to change. He would promise there will be a new start.
03:13:58.66 --> 03:14:06.50 So he's coming hard. He's coming hard. And this, that chapter in particular. So I talked about
03:14:06.50 --> 03:14:10.50 some of the challenges of other chapters and you know either you know finding material or
03:14:10.50 --> 03:14:15.54 figuring out what the chapter is about and how that chapter served the larger story. The story
03:14:15.54 --> 03:14:23.30 of the special forces presented a problem but I was not prepared for. Every chapter took about
03:14:23.30 --> 03:14:32.02 you know between six, around six, seven months to write. When I got to and and they all followed
03:14:32.02 --> 03:14:43.78 a similar pattern, you know, whether the unit was a Navy unit that we're talking about where it's
03:14:43.78 --> 03:14:50.66 being created, committed to action and then it's retained in the order of battle or whether it's an
03:14:50.66 --> 03:14:56.58 army or marine core unit that is created and then disbanded. There was there was this pattern
03:14:56.58 --> 03:15:04.58 that was sort of predictable, you know, Navy unit created army unit disbanded or marine core whatever.
03:15:04.58 --> 03:15:11.78 When you get to and it fit with, you know, my understanding of my thesis which was the Navy's
03:15:11.78 --> 03:15:18.74 continuing to fill this gap in the order of battle and that held until the special forces.
03:15:18.74 --> 03:15:22.90 When I get to the special forces like my thesis sort of like started to crumble and I had this
03:15:22.90 --> 03:15:29.06 moment of like panic where I was like, I mean the only thing I can do is just ignore the entire
03:15:29.06 --> 03:15:33.14 existence of the special forces because it's I mean it doesn't fit with what I've been doing for
03:15:33.14 --> 03:15:42.10 the past, you know, seven years and when I, you know, obviously it's not what I did, I think because
03:15:42.10 --> 03:15:46.66 it's not the right thing to do because you're telling a history you have to, you know, understand
03:15:46.66 --> 03:15:51.22 the relationship. You can't just change history to history. I mean you mean there's so many times
03:15:51.22 --> 03:15:55.38 if you're writing history that, you know, the temptation is there you want to, you know, make the
03:15:55.38 --> 03:16:00.66 facts fit your narrative. That's not, that's not honest and it's not what you're supposed to do. So
03:16:00.66 --> 03:16:07.94 I ended up having to take an entire year and did nothing but, you know, really learn the history
03:16:07.94 --> 03:16:13.22 of the Army Special Forces, which is a fascinating history. But it also, you know, revealed
03:16:13.86 --> 03:16:18.90 within, you know, three or four months that it wasn't the fact that the special forces was, you know,
03:16:18.90 --> 03:16:25.38 created committed action and disbanded. It was that they were completely reoriented to a non-commanded
03:16:25.38 --> 03:16:35.06 type mission and no one was more consequential in that shift than your bro. Yeah, the, the end
03:16:35.06 --> 03:16:40.10 up, the gap that all these other Raider units would fill and then to get disbanded, he didn't
03:16:40.10 --> 03:16:44.66 go into that gap. He went into this other gap. He went into this other gap and then then there was a gap
03:16:44.66 --> 03:16:51.38 that was created by President Kennedy and, and trying to connect those two people, I couldn't
03:16:51.38 --> 03:16:55.78 figure it out until I found that article about Spartacus about Kennedy watching this movie.
03:16:55.78 --> 03:16:59.46 Yeah, he gets into the cell that story. I'm not going to cover it, but tell that story.
03:16:59.46 --> 03:17:06.90 In the, in the, in the months leading up to his inauguration, he's, he's been elected, but he
03:17:06.90 --> 03:17:13.30 hasn't yet become president. He gets his brother tells him how great the movie, how the
03:17:13.30 --> 03:17:20.02 Kirk dog of this movie Spartacus is. And you know, his, you know, in coming Secretary of the Navy
03:17:20.02 --> 03:17:23.86 happens to be going as an extra ticket, you know, Mr. President Alec, would you like to go?
03:17:24.90 --> 03:17:30.58 So he goes. And the movie's already started. The theater owner sees, you know, Kennedy come in,
03:17:30.58 --> 03:17:34.82 stops everything, brings him upstairs, they have a cup of coffee together, everybody, all the other
03:17:34.82 --> 03:17:39.62 theater goers that are waiting for him to start. So it goes down with the cup of coffee,
03:17:39.62 --> 03:17:45.06 restarts the movie and he watches the thing and he comes out and he's, I mean, it's a, if you've
03:17:45.06 --> 03:17:50.58 ever seen, you know, Spartacus, it's, you know, it's the epic. I mean, when I was a kid, I saw it, it was,
03:17:50.58 --> 03:17:57.54 I mean, I've never seen anything like it in, and it makes an impression on him. And where, you know,
03:17:57.54 --> 03:18:05.14 it's a, it's a slave army that, you know, is fighting across Italy and they're, liberating other slaves
03:18:05.14 --> 03:18:10.50 and they're turning them into gladiators. And that's what Kennedy wants to do. And he sees in this
03:18:10.50 --> 03:18:15.46 movie he sees an answer to his problem. You know, we're going to turn these, you know,
03:18:15.46 --> 03:18:23.70 legions of, you know, third world, you know, people into, you know, our army of freedom.
03:18:24.66 --> 03:18:31.22 And Yarbob brought into that. But into it. Oh, yeah. Meanwhile, fast forward a little bit.
03:18:33.22 --> 03:18:39.06 Chapter 11. At one o'clock on January 1st, 1962, a Monday,
03:18:39.06 --> 03:18:46.74 sealed team one was without fanfare of any kind, unceremoniously commissioned on naval amphibious
03:18:46.74 --> 03:18:52.26 base coronado right where the neck of San Diego's palm treeed resort island met the flat
03:18:52.26 --> 03:18:59.54 seven mile long sandy itsmus called the silver strand located on this base up an inch of military
03:18:59.54 --> 03:19:04.74 grade right angles that jutted out into the sparkling waters of San Diego Bay. The team's physical
03:19:04.74 --> 03:19:11.06 footprint was little more than a single ward war to era quansit hut. The team's authorized
03:19:11.06 --> 03:19:16.42 strength was for 10 officers in 50 enlisted men, most of whom had not yet been pulled from their
03:19:16.42 --> 03:19:23.38 west coast underwater demolition teams. The man most responsible for recruiting, equipping and training
03:19:23.38 --> 03:19:30.26 these men was their 29 year old commanding officer lieutenant David Del Judas.
03:19:30.26 --> 03:19:37.54 Raise just outside a Newark New Jersey by Italian speaking, working class parents Del Judas
03:19:37.54 --> 03:19:42.34 was of average height and athletic build and like nearly every other frogman well-tanned.
03:19:44.18 --> 03:19:53.86 As an officer at UDT-12, he had been selected to lead a 10-man detachment of Vietnam on a two-week
03:19:53.86 --> 03:19:59.14 trip up the May Kong River to deliver landing craft to Lui, Lai Ocean troops, troops at the army
03:19:59.14 --> 03:20:03.22 special forces were already training for combat, briefed on the insurgents and the men you
03:20:03.22 --> 03:20:07.78 of reptiles that he and his men were sure to encounter, they had seen neither just 100 miles of
03:20:07.78 --> 03:20:13.62 mud-browned river. Now Del Judas was in charge of a unit that had been created in no small
03:20:13.62 --> 03:20:21.62 part to return to that river but to what end no one quite knew. So there you go, seal teams get commissioned.
03:20:21.62 --> 03:20:34.10 And this is when all the history finally you know start to collide. It culminates in this and
03:20:34.10 --> 03:20:42.50 and you know the individual that collides in as Phil Bacquillou who's been there
03:20:43.62 --> 03:20:49.86 literally from the beginning of Naval Special Warfare and there's a reason that you know the
03:20:49.86 --> 03:20:55.22 Naval Special Warfare Center is named after this person. The Phil H. Bucklou Center for Naval Special Warfare
03:20:55.22 --> 03:21:01.70 Yeah, I mean it wouldn't I mean he he doesn't create you know the the scouts and raiders
03:21:01.70 --> 03:21:08.98 don't create the UDTs he doesn't create the seal teams but he's there for these critical moments
03:21:09.62 --> 03:21:18.74 to help the seal teams along. And his his ability to form relationships his ability to write
03:21:18.74 --> 03:21:25.22 because he was obviously with any super humble and and is able to get his conveyance message apart.
03:21:26.74 --> 03:21:31.94 Yeah, convey his message in such a way that really there's only one answer but he never
03:21:31.94 --> 03:21:35.30 gives the answer. It's like he allows people to discover the truth for themselves which is the best way
03:21:35.30 --> 03:21:40.58 to get people to discover the truth. Better than I can't have said it. Yes. We're sure I have that in there.
03:21:41.62 --> 03:21:44.34 Yeah, he writes these well we'll get to it.
03:21:44.34 --> 03:21:53.38 Phil H. Bucklou. When he had left his house on December 7, 1941 Phil H. Bucklou was a six foot
03:21:53.38 --> 03:21:58.66 two inch 235 pound former fullback for the Cleveland Rams who's major concerned that morning
03:21:58.66 --> 03:22:03.70 had been to choose one of the four football contracts burning a hole in his pocket with thinning
03:22:03.70 --> 03:22:09.78 hair and a heavy jaw curled lip and downturned eyes not to mention a torso as thick as a tree trunk
03:22:09.78 --> 03:22:16.42 Bucklou at 26 looked 10 years old when he was and was 10 times as mean while intimidating from a distance
03:22:16.82 --> 03:22:21.62 Bucklou up close actually possessed a personality that accomplished the opposite. He had never
03:22:21.62 --> 03:22:27.06 attracted to his orbit enough players to found that coaches own football team. The ors are he
03:22:27.06 --> 03:22:33.14 had even attracted enough players to his orbit to found and coaches own football team the Columbus
03:22:33.14 --> 03:22:41.46 bullies a team on its way to another league championship had the Japanese not exploded the afternoon
03:22:41.46 --> 03:22:45.22 as they did. If I would have known about the Columbus bullies my task in a task in a bruiser might
03:22:45.22 --> 03:22:48.98 have been the task in a bullies instead. One of those things.
03:22:52.82 --> 03:22:57.06 In the Sicily campaign he had checked to check the beach himself and fast forward a little bit
03:22:57.06 --> 03:23:01.22 then signal to the fleet from the bobbing shell of a black and kayak while screaming balls
03:23:01.22 --> 03:23:05.06 of fire skipped off the water round him in the weeks before normandy invasion he skimmed to the
03:23:05.06 --> 03:23:09.54 coast and collected density testing bottom samples to up to 20 yards from the shore.
03:23:10.50 --> 03:23:15.14 Then evaded a flattilla of six enemy trawlers and a crash of bullet snaps from
03:23:15.70 --> 03:23:20.98 MG 42 machine gun by escaping into the night and fog on the smoke grade dawn of D day buckloon
03:23:20.98 --> 03:23:26.34 his LCT scout boat crew led the first wave of floating tanks to Omaha Beach fired earspitting
03:23:26.34 --> 03:23:30.58 rockets and twin 50 cow machine guns to silence in enemy pillbox then spent the day
03:23:30.58 --> 03:23:35.54 throttling through bread clouded water and mine topped obstacles to pluck drowning soldiers
03:23:35.54 --> 03:23:42.02 from burning land in craft. Fast forward for his service in World War II buckloon received an
03:23:42.02 --> 03:23:47.62 unheard of number of commendations a bronze star from North Africa a silver star for Solono
03:23:47.62 --> 03:23:54.02 and then a brace of navy crosses one for Sicily another for Omaha Beach not even his friend
03:23:54.02 --> 03:23:59.38 in fellow footballer buck helper and had been awarded as many. Naturally such a record had opened
03:23:59.38 --> 03:24:04.26 doors to more unconventional opportunities including two and a half years in Korea more than twice
03:24:04.26 --> 03:24:09.46 the length of a standard war tour where buckloon doubled as the navy's represented to the CIA
03:24:09.46 --> 03:24:14.26 and led the beach jumpers a navy unit created to collect and jam the enemy's electronic
03:24:14.26 --> 03:24:20.58 communications or periodically mimic them to so chaos in their transmissions. So there's just
03:24:20.58 --> 03:24:26.50 some of the stuff that you talk about that that buckloose got going on and that's another one of
03:24:26.50 --> 03:24:31.22 those units to the beach jumpers right another one of these random units that the navy puts
03:24:31.22 --> 03:24:39.78 together freaking just get some. So he's got to write this report we're talking about why he had to
03:24:39.78 --> 03:24:47.38 write this report. He had to write the report because the original commander got sent home and
03:24:47.38 --> 03:24:51.94 the reason the original commander of the the commission or the survey team
03:24:51.94 --> 03:25:00.74 we don't know if he was sent home for a health problem or as one person said for a closet
03:25:00.74 --> 03:25:07.38 drunkenness but they I mean the the the point of this report that there's sent to
03:25:08.50 --> 03:25:13.38 to create is to figure out what the hell the navy's supposed to do in Vietnam. It's not a
03:25:13.38 --> 03:25:18.98 it's not a theater that any naval commander is eager to you know insert himself into.
03:25:18.98 --> 03:25:27.14 So there's no early Burke at the home of the navy at this point so the character of
03:25:28.18 --> 03:25:32.90 naval leadership is slightly different maybe not as aggressive but they still want to you know
03:25:32.90 --> 03:25:37.94 see what the navy can do so they send the survey team but the people that they select for the
03:25:37.94 --> 03:25:47.06 survey team are almost you know they're sort of they're waiting the scales a little bit I mean
03:25:47.06 --> 03:25:53.22 they send David Del Judas who is you know he's the commanding officer of the team one they
03:25:53.22 --> 03:25:59.22 send a filial killer who's a former UDT guy from the Pacific theater silver star winner
03:25:59.22 --> 03:26:03.62 and they sent full buckler was the second in command who is you know nobody has had a more
03:26:03.62 --> 03:26:10.26 inland naval experience outside of the sealed teams in this guy. Make him the number two
03:26:10.82 --> 03:26:15.38 the commanding officer gets sent home putting full buckler in charge of this report they spend the next
03:26:15.38 --> 03:26:21.62 six weeks two months you know hopscotch in the country trying to figure out what to do and
03:26:23.38 --> 03:26:31.30 the report that he creates is entirely his I mean he let's no one else take the responsibility for
03:26:31.30 --> 03:26:35.70 this report he drafts it himself he types it himself even he doesn't have a yomendo a he
03:26:35.70 --> 03:26:41.30 did you see original copies of this thing yeah freaking legit and it took a surprisingly long time
03:26:41.30 --> 03:26:46.02 to find it I couldn't find it anywhere I know you have images of these things are you take pictures
03:26:46.02 --> 03:26:51.38 of all these things yeah my having images of that night um yeah I don't I don't have any of the
03:26:51.38 --> 03:26:55.86 original documents there's um left everything at the archive where it should be but if you need
03:26:55.86 --> 03:27:01.70 smuggle any out not saying that the temptation wasn't there because some of the archives that I you
03:27:01.70 --> 03:27:08.18 know went to you know they're uh some of their record keeping you know has a little bit to be desired
03:27:08.18 --> 03:27:13.62 and you want to protect you know this history you know uh but no I never you know that it's all
03:27:13.62 --> 03:27:20.74 there but yes found the report and uh yeah holding it is a little weird holding a lot of these
03:27:20.74 --> 03:27:26.10 documents because you you know you haven't touched are most likely no one's touched some of the stuff
03:27:26.82 --> 03:27:34.34 since they were printed off a type off or whatever you have here according to buckler this is the
03:27:34.34 --> 03:27:39.38 report according to buckler the battle required something not unlike the riverine force used in
03:27:40.10 --> 03:27:46.66 the American Civil War in which set Abraham Lincoln Uncle Sam's web feet had fought not only in the
03:27:46.66 --> 03:27:52.50 deep sea and the broad bay but also up the narrow muddy bay you and wherever the ground was a little
03:27:52.50 --> 03:27:57.94 damp it's quite a great I mean quotes freaking Abraham Lincoln this report this guy's crafty
03:27:57.94 --> 03:28:04.02 for an unconventional example in a modified amphibious environment buckler could have drawn attention to
03:28:04.02 --> 03:28:10.66 his own legacy he didn't he never did so the humility Lincoln's fleet was example enough
03:28:10.66 --> 03:28:16.42 and practical terms his solution for the navy here to four failure was a comprehensive overhaul
03:28:16.42 --> 03:28:22.34 of the entire counter infiltration effort then you talk about this idea of counter infiltration
03:28:22.34 --> 03:28:27.22 as opposed to counter has opposed to counterinsurgs they want to keep the the infiltrators
03:28:27.22 --> 03:28:31.86 the the communists from pushing into south Vietnam it's a blockade I mean that's a traditional
03:28:31.86 --> 03:28:37.78 navy mission maybe doesn't understand counterinsurgency maybe there's much more comfortable with
03:28:37.78 --> 03:28:43.46 with a blockade right and and so therefore according therefore more navy boots more navy
03:28:43.46 --> 03:28:48.82 boarding teams more riverine checkpoints submarine nets navigation lights a system for checking
03:28:48.82 --> 03:28:55.86 cargo manifests and forcing and forcing curve views and exchange for all this more navy representation
03:28:55.86 --> 03:29:01.38 in four core planning on the question of whether the navy was missing the boat on counter
03:29:01.38 --> 03:29:07.78 insurgency the winning of the locals loyalty through civic action and leading the indigenous
03:29:07.78 --> 03:29:13.38 troops buckler's report was comparatively silent especially given the date just 86 days since
03:29:13.38 --> 03:29:18.26 Kennedy's assassination though he recommended increased boat supports two special forces
03:29:18.26 --> 03:29:23.46 camps he already judged the green berets efforts as slow in time consuming and therefore in effective
03:29:23.46 --> 03:29:31.70 fast forward a little bit in its 46 pages the report used the term counterinsurgency only two times
03:29:31.70 --> 03:29:38.18 or sorry only three times a somewhat nebulous field buckler would one day call it four fewer mentions
03:29:38.18 --> 03:29:45.38 than the term counter infiltration the reports preferred mission appearing at total of 10 times
03:29:45.38 --> 03:29:53.06 was a variant of the term rating a tactic that could said the report in gender more fight back
03:29:53.06 --> 03:29:59.78 spirit amongst the rag sailors though those were the south Vietnamese trained riverine sailors
03:29:59.78 --> 03:30:06.90 but would require companies of pursuit raiders preferably marines or rangers and who would
03:30:06.90 --> 03:30:11.78 accompany such and who would command such raids on this question the former scout radar
03:30:11.78 --> 03:30:17.62 turned sake ogorella did not blink the overwater transport of rating and landing forces should
03:30:17.62 --> 03:30:25.78 be a navy responsibility yeah that I mean that that part alone I mean the fact that he doesn't
03:30:25.78 --> 03:30:31.70 even mention seals in that I mean clearly the navy thinks like I mean if there's not like a little
03:30:31.70 --> 03:30:35.70 you know you know that when the teacher you know pounds on the chalkboard says hey you might
03:30:35.70 --> 03:30:40.50 want to remember this for the test like that's what he's saying like hey don't you guys think
03:30:40.50 --> 03:30:43.94 that you want to be doing this mission and the army and the main person like
03:30:43.94 --> 03:30:52.26 yeah crazy nine days later on February 25th 1964 the buckler report the name by which even
03:30:52.26 --> 03:30:56.58 McNamara would refer to it was officially distributed to leaders across the navy
03:30:56.58 --> 03:31:02.10 Matt V in the joint chiefs of staff eventually rising to the office of secretary defense
03:31:02.10 --> 03:31:07.54 it was handled said buckler like a hot potato actually was more like a gauntlet a challenge to the
03:31:07.54 --> 03:31:13.46 navy's leaders to not only directly fight an inland river war but to fight it in a way that mostly
03:31:13.46 --> 03:31:18.10 deviated from the consensus strategy of counter insurgency over the next two years this challenge
03:31:18.10 --> 03:31:24.58 would propel the navy toward the development of new vessels new organizations and most importantly
03:31:24.58 --> 03:31:34.18 new missions including the reports most recommended rating beyond the river banks so there it is
03:31:35.46 --> 03:31:42.90 from there the seal start creeping inland that's what starts happening and and here's the
03:31:42.90 --> 03:31:48.50 intro that i started this this podcast out with um debt one silting one debt golf billy making
03:31:49.22 --> 03:31:55.30 that's what's happening from there they start they start making adjustments to training
03:31:56.90 --> 03:32:00.90 right this is the navy has set up the seal teams they haven't created i mean they created the
03:32:00.90 --> 03:32:04.42 seal teams but they haven't determined what the seal teams are going to be they've raised them like
03:32:04.42 --> 03:32:08.74 a parent was going to raise a child they like planted a seed right but the child is ultimately
03:32:08.74 --> 03:32:13.06 going to be the one who decides what his future is going to be like and they you know all of this
03:32:13.06 --> 03:32:21.22 has come together into this last you know last two chapters like here we are uh and you know they
03:32:21.22 --> 03:32:25.38 they have trouble in the beginning they're almost sent home they all the seals almost completely
03:32:25.38 --> 03:32:32.74 missed the war anyway the you uh some so that the guys start coming back from those via nom
03:32:32.74 --> 03:32:37.86 deployments and like i said they start making adjustments because they're creeping more and more inland
03:32:37.86 --> 03:32:45.22 um i like this one some of these things some of these things just warm my heart because
03:32:45.22 --> 03:32:49.30 because i'm so connected to them right so here we go back to the book frustrated with the enemies
03:32:49.30 --> 03:32:54.50 retreat from the rung sats river banks debt golf had already started pushing further inland so far
03:32:54.50 --> 03:32:59.46 in fact that seal team ones replacement platoons were now anticipating almost nothing but helicopter
03:32:59.46 --> 03:33:04.98 insertions so we're we might not even be in the water at all not even next to a river to better
03:33:04.98 --> 03:33:11.86 prepare for this inland land warfare seal team ones Anderson had ordered guy stone a former
03:33:11.86 --> 03:33:16.90 Korean war soldier and forward observer who had left the army to be government-listed seal
03:33:16.90 --> 03:33:23.30 to create a six week long pre-deployment course in basic infantry tactics with a training camp
03:33:23.30 --> 03:33:28.58 carved into the chocolate mountains some 100 miles east of the Pacific Ocean stone had trained
03:33:28.58 --> 03:33:33.94 his team one comrades in every skill of soldiering that he knew everything from contour navigating
03:33:33.94 --> 03:33:41.14 to mortars every skill a step closer to navy infantrymen to the commanders now convened and
03:33:41.14 --> 03:33:47.62 coronado such development seemed to justify an official revision to the navies to the seals
03:33:47.62 --> 03:33:53.78 navy imposed operational boundaries in other words what deljudice anderson and early were
03:33:53.78 --> 03:34:00.34 describing as direct missions outside of a purely naval or maritime environment as they already knew
03:34:00.34 --> 03:34:05.70 there was only one other available area that could present a navy unit with that kind of opportunity
03:34:05.70 --> 03:34:13.62 an area contemporary a contemporary described as the wars true bastion of iron the maycon delta
03:34:15.14 --> 03:34:22.10 yeah i've had some some Vietnam seals on here but that connection to our west coast desert training
03:34:22.10 --> 03:34:28.18 facility that's it man like that's you go out there and you know i had Roger Hayden on here
03:34:28.18 --> 03:34:34.58 was a Vietnam yeah just uh well it's right you worked at work on but he was you know he'd
03:34:34.58 --> 03:34:40.66 start talking about being out there at the desert training facility and like they set up the point
03:34:40.66 --> 03:34:45.78 man course when they put booby traps and targets and all that like that's what i did when i got
03:34:45.78 --> 03:34:49.30 silting one you went out there and you did the point man course everybody did the point man course
03:34:49.30 --> 03:34:56.26 that came directly from these guys in Vietnam so that these things are um you can still you can
03:34:56.26 --> 03:35:06.58 still i still have that thread yeah i'm gonna push forward a little bit
03:35:08.82 --> 03:35:16.18 get into some some of these stories that you you you get from the fighting that the seals
03:35:16.18 --> 03:35:22.18 start doing as they push in and this is the this is where the reputation really starts to stand strong
03:35:22.18 --> 03:35:28.42 on a jump into the middle of a mission here realizing that the enemy was already moving to cut
03:35:28.42 --> 03:35:34.02 them off galager decided the only thing left to do was fight this decision made he directed his
03:35:34.02 --> 03:35:40.66 men to make for the only cover around alone pezance house but to win just 20 uncomfortable yards
03:35:40.66 --> 03:35:45.94 away from the nearest tree line when they reached it their first job was to calm the family inside
03:35:45.94 --> 03:35:51.46 not an easy task for any home invader and one in which the squad was only partially successful as
03:35:51.46 --> 03:35:56.98 two children quickly escaped sure to eventually tell the vehicle on their position next most important
03:35:56.98 --> 03:36:03.54 was to check the wounded y'all's entire left side was starting to freeze up and fix whatever was wrong
03:36:03.54 --> 03:36:08.98 with the radio the same troubleshooting checklist of cleaning connectors swapping out handsets
03:36:08.98 --> 03:36:14.66 changing batteries plus a healthy amount of cursing and praying this troubleshooting however
03:36:14.66 --> 03:36:21.14 was only partially successful when sure finally got the radio back online the only other person who
03:36:21.14 --> 03:36:26.02 could hear him was jack roul the radio man for seven a and they had problems of their own
03:36:26.82 --> 03:36:33.54 at a little before three a m Peterson and squad seven a consider themselves in a very difficult position
03:36:34.02 --> 03:36:38.42 everywhere they looked in the surrounding tree line there was movement at one point Peterson had
03:36:38.42 --> 03:36:43.94 even seen torches what seemed like hundreds of them moving toward their south
03:36:44.82 --> 03:36:49.46 but as they were now finding out over the radio it could have been even worse once galager and
03:36:49.46 --> 03:36:56.98 seven bees situation was learned Peterson was quick to count his blessing first he had none of
03:36:56.98 --> 03:37:02.50 galager's casualties except for the lyrp who had shot the man Peterson had meant to interrogate
03:37:02.50 --> 03:37:07.38 every one of his men still had a full load of load out of ammunition next was his position
03:37:07.38 --> 03:37:12.66 clear field of fire and every direction and the cemetery's berm for cover even concrete
03:37:12.66 --> 03:37:18.34 vaults if the enemy brought in his mortars most important of all roul's radio was now working as
03:37:18.34 --> 03:37:24.18 it should putting the squad in reach of army slicks and navy sea wolves who were at that moment
03:37:24.18 --> 03:37:30.50 on their way to seven a's wreck rescue or at least they had been. Recognizing seven bees
03:37:30.50 --> 03:37:36.10 overwhelming need Peterson quickly made two decisions first he ordered roul to relay seven
03:37:36.10 --> 03:37:41.06 bees position to the helicopters effectively putting his own squad at the back of the line
03:37:41.06 --> 03:37:46.26 second and this decision was made by default of the first seven a would now fight the encircling
03:37:46.26 --> 03:37:52.18 enemy alone. Just as Peterson's decision was made and the helicopters began diverting south
03:37:52.18 --> 03:37:57.46 a group of some thirty-vehacong fighters as if sensing seven a's sudden vulnerability
03:37:57.46 --> 03:38:03.30 step clear of the eastern woodline spread themselves into a scream of scourmeters and started
03:38:03.30 --> 03:38:07.86 forward. The first wave was coming and no one knew what was coming behind it.
03:38:09.62 --> 03:38:14.42 Having been forced to spend the first few minutes at the farmhouse calming peasants
03:38:14.42 --> 03:38:20.34 dressing wounds and fixing the radio galager despite shards of metal in his legs was now
03:38:20.34 --> 03:38:24.74 checking each man's field of fire and telling him to hold that fire until he gave the order.
03:38:25.38 --> 03:38:30.10 As men organized their positions with easily accessible stacks of ammunition and grenades
03:38:30.10 --> 03:38:34.26 they scanned their sectors for any sign of movement. They didn't have to scan line
03:38:35.06 --> 03:38:39.38 scan long soon between the rice bales there was movement everywhere.
03:38:39.38 --> 03:38:45.94 Look at them all said boin. It looks like hundreds of them. But as best you could tell
03:38:45.94 --> 03:38:50.98 hundreds who by their milling around still had no idea where the Americans were.
03:38:52.10 --> 03:38:58.42 Right about the time that boin was making that assessment hooked her received what they had been
03:38:58.42 --> 03:39:03.86 quietly desperate for. The check-in procedures from lieutenant commander Myers of the Navy C
03:39:03.86 --> 03:39:10.26 Wolves who rattled off the loadout first flight of two helicopters. Wings rack with 2.75 inch
03:39:10.82 --> 03:39:17.38 rockets and machine guns then gave his altitude and vicinity a racetrack in the sky far enough away
03:39:17.38 --> 03:39:22.74 so as to not reveal seven bees position. In response to your gave a physical description of the
03:39:22.74 --> 03:39:28.42 rice paddy and seven bees location in it along with the rapidly deteriorating situation
03:39:28.42 --> 03:39:35.14 multiple wounded and enemy everywhere. The next call was the lead pilot of the army's flight of
03:39:35.14 --> 03:39:42.34 slicks who upon hearing of seven bees situation replied he would not be able to help as it was a
03:39:42.34 --> 03:39:48.66 quote violation of squadron policy to land in a hot LZ end quote. What happened next is a matter of
03:39:48.66 --> 03:39:54.58 some dispute. One account suggests that the seawolf pilots may have shamed their army peers by offering
03:39:54.58 --> 03:39:59.94 to pick up the seals themselves or at least the wounded. The Navy fuselage could only handle
03:39:59.94 --> 03:40:05.70 one or two men. Another explicitly claims that the seawolf commander told the army pilot
03:40:05.70 --> 03:40:10.74 you're going to go down or I'm going to shoot you down. Whatever the truth within a few minutes
03:40:10.74 --> 03:40:15.14 the matter was resolved and Gallagher told Ture to tell the helicopters what he wanted.
03:40:15.78 --> 03:40:21.30 At a little before 315 a.m. the moon behind him two seawolf started their attack run across the
03:40:21.30 --> 03:40:26.90 rice paddy as they closed with the tree line someone in the squad there's some dispute as to who
03:40:26.90 --> 03:40:31.94 stepped out of the farmhouse, ripped the pole ring on a marked 13 signal flare and tossed it in the
03:40:31.94 --> 03:40:37.70 grass. Within a second the flare ignited a bonfire size glow that told the pilots exactly where
03:40:37.70 --> 03:40:42.42 the seals were but also drew the bullet snaps of every muzzle now blazing from the tree line.
03:40:43.14 --> 03:40:48.02 As the seals flinch beneath the fire and responded with their own the world above them exploded
03:40:48.02 --> 03:40:53.78 with the swamp of the two gunships strafing the enemies muzzle flashes with their rockets and
03:40:53.78 --> 03:40:58.98 form machine guns. With the landing skids directly above them the combination of rotor blades
03:40:58.98 --> 03:41:05.38 and rocket exhaust nearly ripped the roof off the farmhouse. As the seawolfs unleashed this chaos
03:41:05.38 --> 03:41:10.18 several seals got online and followed suit launching grenades and shredding through belts of
03:41:10.18 --> 03:41:18.34 stone arounds they had so as so linked. The noise was unbelievable. Row one man afterward and it
03:41:18.34 --> 03:41:24.18 looked like something not of this world. Behind this cover the army pilot reluctantly landed his
03:41:24.18 --> 03:41:29.54 slick and Gallagher directed the firing line of seals to begin bounding back toward it. While the
03:41:29.54 --> 03:41:35.14 firing line covered Mike Boitian transformed himself into an ambulance cradling men from the
03:41:35.14 --> 03:41:40.82 cooch to the helicopter then helping to shoulder yaw to a seat cram between the pilot and copilot.
03:41:40.82 --> 03:41:45.46 Finding Gallagher limping away from the firing line his rifle still in hand and compressing
03:41:45.46 --> 03:41:50.74 a fresh gunshot wound and leaning into the rotor wash like it was a driving rain. Boitian picked
03:41:50.74 --> 03:41:55.54 him up and heaved him so hard into the helicopters, opened door that he flew right out the other
03:41:55.54 --> 03:42:01.06 side. That accident forced Boitian to run all the way around the helicopter and repeat the effort
03:42:01.06 --> 03:42:06.90 finally stashing Gallagher all the way in the back. Once everyone was finally loaded the pilot
03:42:06.90 --> 03:42:12.34 eagerly applied his collective pitch control lever until several knocks on the helmet forced him
03:42:12.34 --> 03:42:18.98 to look back. Hey we still got men on the ground, Boitian yelled above the noise. At this the pilot
03:42:18.98 --> 03:42:24.82 depressed his collective just in time for Roy Matthews the barrel of his stoner glowing hot red
03:42:24.82 --> 03:42:29.54 to dash from the pooch and clamber aboard rounds now clanking against the fuselage.
03:42:29.54 --> 03:42:34.10 This time the pilot's lift off sent a shutter throughout the entire helicopter,
03:42:34.10 --> 03:42:39.46 prompting yaw to crane his head toward the dash where he saw an RPM indicator flashing red.
03:42:40.18 --> 03:42:44.82 While gaining the next hundred feet of elevation the helicopter shook like it would suddenly drop
03:42:44.82 --> 03:42:50.66 out of the sky, a feeling that only intensified when every gun still connected to a living communist
03:42:50.66 --> 03:42:56.42 finger started firing and surrounding the slick with green tracers. It was a barrage that had
03:42:56.42 --> 03:43:02.10 resulted from the near simultaneous lift off of the sea wolves because they had somewhere else to be.
03:43:08.74 --> 03:43:16.50 Yeah I mean then you you go into talk about how they go now and take care of Peterson and
03:43:16.50 --> 03:43:26.50 seven alpha. I mean if I had written any slower this would not have been written because the you know a lot of the
03:43:26.50 --> 03:43:31.78 guys that gave me the stories from this thing are no longer here. Ron yaw just passed away a couple
03:43:31.78 --> 03:43:38.98 months ago. Men just died Bob Gallagher just died. All the history is you know very, very slowly but
03:43:38.98 --> 03:43:47.62 it's happening. I mean one of the last things that Pete Peterson well one of the last interactions I had
03:43:47.62 --> 03:43:52.82 with Pete because Pete was more than generous with his time to do interviews with us but one of the
03:43:52.82 --> 03:43:59.86 last things that he did was I sent him a Gallicopy of the book before it had published to get it
03:43:59.86 --> 03:44:06.50 in Bob Gallagher's hands so he could see this. I want to you know every you know all the folks that I
03:44:06.50 --> 03:44:10.34 interviewed from seven plateau in the one person that would not be actually a spot Gallagher.
03:44:13.46 --> 03:44:21.78 That said I still was anxious for him to know you know the legacy and the contribution that he had
03:44:21.78 --> 03:44:26.82 you know not just to the seal teams but to you know establishing you know what ultimately the
03:44:26.82 --> 03:44:34.66 seal teams became the mission that the seal teams have. So sent the copy of the book to Pete
03:44:34.66 --> 03:44:41.38 drove it over to Bob's house and Pete you know didn't get an information on whether or not he
03:44:41.38 --> 03:44:50.34 actually read it but after Bob passed they found the copy of the book in his house with a note inside
03:44:50.34 --> 03:44:57.62 that said to past this book onto his best friend. So hopefully very hopefully he was able to at least
03:44:57.62 --> 03:45:06.66 see this. And that's a good indication. You say here when this was done he submitted awards.
03:45:06.66 --> 03:45:11.62 This is Peter's insimited awards up through CTF 116 chain of command. Braun stars for just about
03:45:11.62 --> 03:45:16.90 everyone of every member of seven Bravo a silver star for Bointen and for Gallagher an AV cross
03:45:16.90 --> 03:45:22.10 and award that he had to justify to win awards officer with multiple statements but who responded
03:45:22.10 --> 03:45:29.54 by saying that the evidence could actually support a mental of honor. I hope it does. I mean I think
03:45:29.54 --> 03:45:36.50 there would be that would be really great if this could act as something of a record for maybe
03:45:36.50 --> 03:45:43.86 an adjustment of some of these awards. We'll see. Yeah I mean right now I think we got Gallagher and Watson.
03:45:43.86 --> 03:45:55.22 But yeah and one of the great things are one of the most interesting things about that episode
03:45:55.22 --> 03:46:01.14 is the Peterson submits himself for nothing. How many officers or how many people do we work with
03:46:01.14 --> 03:46:07.06 over the course of our careers that their preoccupation was what awards they're going to get out of this.
03:46:07.06 --> 03:46:16.90 A wards are one of those funny things that they don't always necessarily say what the person
03:46:16.90 --> 03:46:24.98 deserves. They often say how good their chain of command was in recognizing what they got.
03:46:24.98 --> 03:46:33.38 A wards are crazy. A wards say as much about the person that submits them for it as it does about
03:46:33.38 --> 03:46:41.78 the person himself. I mean I had a guy I saw a guy on here Dick Thompson got gotten to a
03:46:41.78 --> 03:46:48.50 helo to like set up the spy rig or something during a bright light operation ends up the
03:46:48.50 --> 03:46:52.18 helo just takes off. He's getting ready to go and leave. He's getting ready to go and liberty. So he doesn't
03:46:52.18 --> 03:46:57.70 have his weapon. He's never gear with him and the helo takes off to go on this bright light to go
03:46:57.70 --> 03:47:03.54 and rescue down guys. They can't get in. He ends up throwing a rope out, repelling down. Grabbs
03:47:03.54 --> 03:47:09.06 the crew chiefs gone, repels down, no gloves, burns his hands, gets in there, rescues people,
03:47:09.06 --> 03:47:14.98 recovers body from two different heliocats. Completely. It's complete. Oh by the way, he dropped
03:47:14.98 --> 03:47:21.54 down the rope ended and he drops into 150 foot canopy. Just drops. Just let's go and just fall
03:47:21.54 --> 03:47:26.98 through the freaking jungle canopy to get in there. It's totally insane. He gets done with that.
03:47:26.98 --> 03:47:33.22 I mean, there's no possible way he should live number one and no way should he actually rescued
03:47:33.22 --> 03:47:39.94 guys. He lives. He rescued guys. He gets like a bronze star. He can totally insane. And you know,
03:47:39.94 --> 03:47:46.58 here's the other thing about what's what and you you lay this out very clearly. A very important
03:47:46.58 --> 03:47:52.34 thing about this seal team to seventh platoon. What really they were doing great operations but what
03:47:52.34 --> 03:47:58.02 really made it important was that they were doing these intel-driven raids, then they were gathering
03:47:58.02 --> 03:48:03.46 intelligence. They were exploiting that intelligence and they were doing follow-on raids. So this
03:48:03.46 --> 03:48:11.22 set like a standard um it's a it creates our cycle of operations and what's important about that
03:48:11.22 --> 03:48:18.90 is you know we didn't I try and tell everybody that I meet at the seal teams we didn't invent ourselves.
03:48:18.90 --> 03:48:25.06 We didn't everything good about us. We took from somebody else. If anything the seal teams are just
03:48:25.06 --> 03:48:30.10 an aggregate of all the best pieces of all these other units that have come before us. And
03:48:30.10 --> 03:48:35.22 that not just navy units either. We took the best parts of the rangers. We took the best parts of
03:48:35.22 --> 03:48:40.02 the raiders and we combined all that and when we didn't know how to do something we found the best
03:48:40.02 --> 03:48:46.10 person that teaches how to do it and they taught us how to do it and we took it. And same thing
03:48:46.10 --> 03:48:52.26 when it comes to this cycle of capture kill. I mean we sort of stumbled upon it and I think
03:48:54.90 --> 03:49:01.22 guys like Pete Peterson and Bob Gallagher who are really you know leveraging the information that
03:49:01.22 --> 03:49:06.42 they can get from other units and then aggregating that to to drive their own operations. I mean
03:49:06.42 --> 03:49:12.82 like I like Bob Wagner who's you know he is creating essentially single handedly creates the
03:49:12.82 --> 03:49:19.78 P.R.U.s. and the P.R.U. is the best part about that is the cycle of operations that they get
03:49:19.78 --> 03:49:27.46 and that the seal team sort of noticed like we can do that too. So yeah the use of interpreters
03:49:27.46 --> 03:49:31.94 the use of the locals. Yeah the use of the locals not to build a guerilla force but to just
03:49:31.94 --> 03:49:37.14 gather intelligence and go do hits. It's just I mean it's like you know it's no different than
03:49:37.14 --> 03:49:42.10 what you know the police do in every major city across the country. You arrest somebody,
03:49:42.10 --> 03:49:46.18 you shake them down for information and then you go get the next person. It's a cycle of
03:49:46.18 --> 03:49:53.62 operations that just keep perpetuating itself. So you've got incredible sections in here and again
03:49:53.62 --> 03:49:59.38 this whole book we barely even touch the surface of what you've got in this book but I want to finish
03:49:59.38 --> 03:50:11.30 off with this section here. It says this last section I'm going to read. In March of 1969 the
03:50:11.30 --> 03:50:16.90 Rand Corporation, a semi-private think tank that specialized in research and analysis for the
03:50:16.90 --> 03:50:25.06 Department of Defense published a report titled The Navy Seal Commandos, a case study of military
03:50:25.06 --> 03:50:32.98 decision making and organizational change. As far as I know the first academic level study of the seal
03:50:32.98 --> 03:50:41.22 teams. The reports author was Francis J. Bing West, a former force recon marine and Vietnam War
03:50:41.22 --> 03:50:45.62 veteran who's investigation had begun a year earlier and by the way you can read a bunch of his
03:50:46.26 --> 03:50:53.62 books right now. He wrote a bunch of other books. He wrote books about Iraq. His investigation had
03:50:53.62 --> 03:50:58.90 begun a year earlier and whose research had produced a raft of documents, dozens of interviews
03:50:58.90 --> 03:51:05.38 and the first hand observation of several seal missions into the wrongsat and the may-con delta.
03:51:05.78 --> 03:51:11.54 So he went and observed what seals were doing. Then this guy is a forced recon marine himself.
03:51:12.74 --> 03:51:18.74 From this research, West had produced an 18-page report whose introduction provided a brief
03:51:18.74 --> 03:51:24.42 description of seal training. Training he estimated at a cost of around $14,000 per man
03:51:24.42 --> 03:51:30.10 plus an overview of the seal's commitment to Vietnam at its height a commitment that never exceeded
03:51:30.10 --> 03:51:38.26 150 seals or roughly a 100,150 fewer than the in-country height of the Green Braised Total
03:51:38.26 --> 03:51:44.26 Compliment. It was a commitment that stood out in even stark relief when placed next to the
03:51:44.26 --> 03:51:50.90 author's obvious admiration for the seal's progression from lackluster coastal raiders to the war's
03:51:50.90 --> 03:51:58.98 most aggressive direct action commando's. Admittedly, commando's who had no business becoming
03:51:58.98 --> 03:52:05.22 such and had thus drawn the interest of the same preeminent think tank that it created the U.S.
03:52:05.22 --> 03:52:11.86 military's nuclear defense strategy. Intended as a study on organizational change,
03:52:12.74 --> 03:52:18.74 the reports true purpose had been to discover how the Navy could have possibly succeeded in creating
03:52:18.74 --> 03:52:25.46 a land-focused commando force. A force that even the Viet Kong had reportedly dubbed the Men with
03:52:25.46 --> 03:52:32.10 Green Faces, a color not normally associated with the Navy's traditional medium. It was a puzzle
03:52:32.10 --> 03:52:38.58 of personal importance to the officer, to the author. As the Marine Corps, the far more likely branch
03:52:38.58 --> 03:52:42.34 of service had never succeeded in creating anything similar.
03:52:42.34 --> 03:52:49.14 Quote, how the concept was shepherded through the joint chiefs of staff and Congress,
03:52:49.14 --> 03:52:54.34 I am still trying to determine the author wrote. From the mission of the seals,
03:52:54.74 --> 03:53:01.62 exceeded the charter of the U.S. Navy. As best as he could tell, the legality of this
03:53:01.62 --> 03:53:07.54 infringement had been tolerated because of its negligible size, but later had been allowed to
03:53:07.54 --> 03:53:13.06 widen because of a series of factors, none of which at this point should be should come as a surprise.
03:53:14.10 --> 03:53:18.50 The first of these, now here you start talking about how we ended up with this with the seal
03:53:18.50 --> 03:53:24.50 teams. The first of these, at least in the May Kong Delta, submitted the author, had been the neglect
03:53:24.50 --> 03:53:30.42 of the U.S. Army in general, and the 19th-century division in particular, to push their command-o-type
03:53:30.42 --> 03:53:37.86 units to the same to quote, develop the same aggressive attitude towards ambushing that the seals had.
03:53:37.86 --> 03:53:43.78 And quote, it might further be added that neither entity had adequately prepared those command-o-type
03:53:43.78 --> 03:53:49.78 units to make such a transition in the Delta environment, acclaimed best evidenced by one attempt
03:53:49.78 --> 03:53:55.78 to conceal the river insertion of five lirps soldiers by having them copy the seal method
03:53:55.78 --> 03:54:02.02 of jumping from the back of a moving boat, but that ultimately resulted in the drowning of all five
03:54:02.02 --> 03:54:09.06 men. The second factor that accounted for this infringement, the report continued, had been the
03:54:09.06 --> 03:54:16.82 Navy senior officers, whose tours by comparison were mostly dreary affairs, a condition made
03:54:16.82 --> 03:54:23.78 more noticeable when, quote, in the presence of generals and quote, to compensate for this,
03:54:23.78 --> 03:54:29.54 the Navy's leaders had allowed the seals more latitude than they had their other units,
03:54:29.54 --> 03:54:34.58 a black market trade-off that had produced a steady supply of anecdotes for the Navy,
03:54:34.58 --> 03:54:40.58 and thereby, quote, saved the pride of the admirals. That's an interesting concept,
03:54:40.58 --> 03:54:49.70 like the the admirals wanted something to talk about. Ultimately, the author decided the most
03:54:49.70 --> 03:54:56.26 important factors factor in the seals infringement was owing to the seals themselves and the
03:54:56.26 --> 03:55:02.90 culture that weighed upon them. Dron from a notorious selective training program that produced
03:55:02.90 --> 03:55:10.10 few qualified candidates, the seals naturally had had to find a mission that kept casualties low,
03:55:10.10 --> 03:55:16.34 a circumstance that might have pushed them like the lirps or forced reconmarines into a reconnaissance
03:55:16.34 --> 03:55:23.46 role that they had anyone to pass, had they had anyone to pass intelligence on to. So you're saying
03:55:23.46 --> 03:55:29.38 there, look, if you've got a small number of people, probably one of the safest missions you can do
03:55:30.58 --> 03:55:33.62 is, hey, we're going to go into reconnaissance where we're not supposed to be seen, we're not
03:55:33.62 --> 03:55:38.10 supposed to come in contact with the enemy, and his and being west is saying here, like,
03:55:38.10 --> 03:55:42.42 they could have gone in that direction. They could have gone into this reconnaissance role,
03:55:42.42 --> 03:55:49.14 had they had anyone to pass the intelligence to. They hadn't. Nor had there been any great pressure
03:55:49.14 --> 03:55:54.74 from the river reinforced to engage in any sort of green-braised-style advisory duty or civic action.
03:55:55.38 --> 03:55:58.42 So they didn't go in that direction either. They didn't go where Yarbara went.
03:55:58.42 --> 03:56:07.78 Hey, let's go raise a bunch of local guerrillas to fight. Organizational orphans with no larger
03:56:07.78 --> 03:56:15.54 force to support or control them and possessing, quote, no love or admiration for the Vietnamese
03:56:15.54 --> 03:56:21.70 and quote, the seals that set out into the swamps not to prove themselves. They're training
03:56:21.70 --> 03:56:29.30 and already done that, said the author, but quote, because not to go, not to go, would have been
03:56:29.30 --> 03:56:37.70 inexcusable to the others. They had developed a collective value system, which emphasized
03:56:37.70 --> 03:56:46.26 physical, hardiness and courage, and they liked to fight. That's just a beautiful thing.
03:56:46.90 --> 03:56:52.98 So the seals didn't have this, you know, you might talk to an army green-braie, talking about,
03:56:52.98 --> 03:56:56.82 hey, I like my little people, you know, the, the side guys call them little people. They're,
03:56:56.82 --> 03:57:03.54 their form in relationships with the locals. This is a quote, the seals had, quote, no lover
03:57:03.54 --> 03:57:10.18 admiration for the Vietnamese and quote. That's crazy, right? And then, and then just to do that one
03:57:10.18 --> 03:57:14.82 more, to say that one more time, they weren't doing anything to prove themselves. They were doing it
03:57:14.82 --> 03:57:23.46 because, but quote, because not to go, would have been inexcusable to the others. They, they're
03:57:23.46 --> 03:57:27.94 talking about the others. Like it's inexcusable, if you don't go, you're not a seal. You're not a seal.
03:57:27.94 --> 03:57:34.42 It's inexcusable to the other seals. They had developed a collective value system, which emphasized
03:57:34.42 --> 03:57:41.86 physical, hardness and courage, and they liked to fight and quote. So when the tactics of patrol
03:57:41.86 --> 03:57:50.98 and ambush had proved unproductive, nobody, not a seal, meaning no blue water superior officer
03:57:50.98 --> 03:57:59.06 had ordered them to try something else. They had just done it. It was an exceptional adaptation.
03:57:59.06 --> 03:58:04.10 The Marine veteran author made a special note to point out that his fellow Marines had failed to
03:58:04.10 --> 03:58:11.30 mimic and by following the previous logic, for reasons that blamed them for this, a sequence of
03:58:11.30 --> 03:58:17.86 attribution and blame that if the preceding pages have proved anything was not a sufficient explanation.
03:58:17.86 --> 03:58:26.34 quote, what strikes me as most remarkable about the seal story, the author concluded,
03:58:26.34 --> 03:58:33.54 is their performance and their ability to learn and adapt in a decentralized sub-optimizing
03:58:33.54 --> 03:58:34.66 environment.
03:58:34.66 --> 03:58:42.58 quote, though all true and commendable, it was also an explanation that it considered only the
03:58:42.58 --> 03:58:49.78 record that came after 1966. Missing was any analysis that proved deeper than that top layer of
03:58:49.78 --> 03:58:56.50 history whose soil had fertilized this inland evolution. The armies and Marine Corps preceding
03:58:56.50 --> 03:59:02.34 30 years of whip-sawing interest in raids and raiders and the Navy's perennial preoccupation
03:59:02.34 --> 03:59:08.02 with justifying its worth in offensive combat, a preoccupation that had combined with the Navy's
03:59:08.02 --> 03:59:15.38 traditional latitude and the UDD's traditional adaptability to create what several unidentified
03:59:15.38 --> 03:59:20.90 seals soon described to a documentary filmmaker as the wars unsung soldier.
03:59:22.26 --> 03:59:27.30 And quote, what we consider without question the best troops that the country has.
03:59:28.18 --> 03:59:34.82 And quote, both descriptions notable because they didn't use the word sailors.
03:59:34.82 --> 03:59:41.54 And just short of the readers, I just a praisel that had dubbed them the wars quote,
03:59:41.54 --> 03:59:49.94 super-commandos by the end, these would be assessments that were next to impossible to dispute.
03:59:55.54 --> 04:00:03.30 You're kind of a end on being West report. That was one of the first things I found. I found
04:00:03.30 --> 04:00:08.18 that at the UDTC, all these games, archives. When I started this book, I was one of the first places
04:00:08.18 --> 04:00:14.02 I went to do research. And the archives at the UDTC, all these amir, little disorganized.
04:00:14.74 --> 04:00:20.66 And some cases that provides opportunities that you didn't expect. And one of those was
04:00:20.66 --> 04:00:26.66 Bing West report. And I had found it. I read it when I got it, but I hadn't thought about it.
04:00:26.66 --> 04:00:33.38 It provided enough food for thought that it just stuck in the back of my head,
04:00:33.38 --> 04:00:39.06 stuck in the back of my head for at least eight years. And so when I was nearing the end of the
04:00:39.06 --> 04:00:43.14 book and I was trying to find a way to kind of summarize everything that had happened.
04:00:44.50 --> 04:00:49.22 It suddenly dawned on me. I'll go back to that report. And I knew that it had been written by
04:00:49.22 --> 04:00:55.62 Francis J West. I didn't know it was Bing West. It was like, oh my gosh, it's Bing West.
04:00:55.62 --> 04:01:00.26 Like, and I've read, you know, books by Bing West. And not like that, but in a way that, you know,
04:01:00.26 --> 04:01:07.46 it made this thing even more like just strange that it happened. But on one of the last
04:01:07.46 --> 04:01:16.02 ops that we did in Alambar Province, we had gotten my platoon had been ambushed on a rooftop
04:01:17.22 --> 04:01:23.38 sniper overwatch. And one of our, one of our seals, Mark Robbins, I'm going shot through the
04:01:23.38 --> 04:01:29.30 head, took a bullet of 762, round from a peak cam through the right eye and exit at the back of his head.
04:01:30.74 --> 04:01:34.74 And we were cut off from support. We couldn't get any, I was trying to get aircraft down to
04:01:34.74 --> 04:01:39.30 support us. They wouldn't come. They wouldn't come because there were so much, you know, machine gunfire.
04:01:40.34 --> 04:01:47.06 And we were trying to, or I get the other seal element to fight to our position. And they were,
04:01:47.06 --> 04:01:52.34 they just were, they were on foot and trying to get there as quickly as possible. So at one point,
04:01:52.34 --> 04:02:00.98 I asked for a, you know, a Marine QRF. And the Marine QRF was separated from us at the fob by this road
04:02:00.98 --> 04:02:07.22 that we, we called IED Ali. We'd never known a vehicle to drive on this road. Had not gotten IED.
04:02:08.02 --> 04:02:15.54 And one officer, who was there a major, he jumps in a homebie, grabs another homebie, and they
04:02:15.54 --> 04:02:20.02 start trucking down the road to get to our position. They get to us. They provide cover for the
04:02:20.02 --> 04:02:26.74 helicopter to get in. And we, a mark actually, you know, it walks himself to the helicopter,
04:02:27.46 --> 04:02:31.22 remarkably, he's still around. He's a Lake County cop now. Yeah.
04:02:33.30 --> 04:02:39.22 But what makes this, you know, story of more remarkable is that the Marine major, who came to our
04:02:39.22 --> 04:02:44.58 rescue, was Owen West. Thing was, as soon as you started to tell about you exactly where the story
04:02:44.58 --> 04:02:50.90 was going. Like this has to be all west. This has to be big. I was just incredible. Like the, and,
04:02:50.90 --> 04:02:56.66 and, and, being was, you know, the fact that being wrote this report, being had this interaction
04:02:56.66 --> 04:03:03.14 with the seal teams in 1968 and the rights of this report in 1969. Super humble report, too.
04:03:04.26 --> 04:03:09.62 It's incredibly, super generous. And I mean, you have so many opportunities to, you know, draw
04:03:09.62 --> 04:03:14.90 attention to other things and he does it. I mean, he's, he's truly impressed by this organization. What,
04:03:14.90 --> 04:03:22.02 you know, we, you know, as a, as a, as a, as an institution have not done, which I think we should
04:03:22.02 --> 04:03:28.58 do at every opportunity is recognize the, uh, the influence of all of these other units had on our
04:03:28.58 --> 04:03:35.38 creation, you know, soldiers, Marines, Rangers, uh, recon, everybody. They all contributed to who we are.
04:03:35.38 --> 04:03:41.62 And, some sense, our history, I think it's, I mean, especially if you frame it in this way,
04:03:42.34 --> 04:03:48.50 it's not our history. It is our history, but it's a lens that you can use to, to look at the entire
04:03:48.50 --> 04:03:55.62 history of American special operations from World War II to Vietnam. We wouldn't be here without them,
04:03:55.62 --> 04:04:00.34 and in some ways, they would not have changed into the units, so they wouldn't have permanently
04:04:00.34 --> 04:04:07.22 created these units. Had we not set an example for them to also follow? Yeah, I mean, it's, um,
04:04:08.66 --> 04:04:15.06 and, and, you know, the, the thing with being Western, just that humble report that you can, you can,
04:04:16.26 --> 04:04:20.50 I mean, the Marine Corps is just so professional. It's so many ways. It reminds me of Dave Burkou,
04:04:20.50 --> 04:04:27.14 was a top gun pilot, F-18 pilot, Marine Corps, fighter pilot, um, ended up being the
04:04:27.14 --> 04:04:34.74 senior instructor at Top Gun, um, F-35 pilot, F-22, because it's the total stud, um, and he worked
04:04:34.74 --> 04:04:38.90 well as he was a fact with us on the ground, the battle or body, which really interesting is, you know,
04:04:38.90 --> 04:04:44.10 he came from Top Gun, he was the senior instructor at Top Gun. I mean, you're not, you're not going
04:04:44.10 --> 04:04:50.66 to get any more professional of a human being as a Marine, that is the senior instructor at Top Gun.
04:04:51.38 --> 04:04:54.98 And I was talking to him about when he came to one of our briefs, for the first time,
04:04:54.98 --> 04:04:57.94 this is where in the battle of the body, we're doing a brief to some kind of an operation.
04:04:58.74 --> 04:05:05.22 And he was just telling me right away, he was just so impressed with what, with just how the
04:05:05.22 --> 04:05:10.34 brief was. Just how the brief was, you know, this is young Lieutenant Lave Babin and Chief Tony
04:05:10.34 --> 04:05:13.78 of Fraddy, getting up there and talking about what we're going to do, me, given the commanders
04:05:13.78 --> 04:05:18.74 and tent, and like, I remember him telling me that, this was 10 years later, he probably told me that.
04:05:18.74 --> 04:05:26.34 And just that humility to think, oh, these guys are doing something that is square to
04:05:26.34 --> 04:05:33.78 away. And for being to be able to recognize that and write that while the war is still going on,
04:05:35.06 --> 04:05:40.74 that's pretty impressive. And you know, you say that he didn't really probe deeper than the
04:05:40.74 --> 04:05:45.94 layer of history that's prior to 1966, but I'll tell you what, that left plenty of room for you to
04:05:45.94 --> 04:05:53.22 do just that with this book. And this book, which provides so much history, so much information.
04:05:56.10 --> 04:06:00.50 Thank you. And you know, one thing that is awesome about the Marine Corps,
04:06:00.50 --> 04:06:04.42 and I've talked about this on this podcast before, I actually talk a lot about it with clients,
04:06:04.42 --> 04:06:08.02 because the Marine Corps has an incredibly powerful culture.
04:06:08.02 --> 04:06:14.10 I think it might be the strongest culture in the world. Absolutely. I couldn't agree more.
04:06:14.66 --> 04:06:21.38 Yeah, I've said it, you know, time and time again, like, pound for pound, there is no
04:06:21.38 --> 04:06:30.66 institution like the US Marine Corps. There are ability to, they require much more from
04:06:30.66 --> 04:06:36.26 everybody, from their troops than every other branch of service. The trade off, though,
04:06:36.26 --> 04:06:42.02 with that by requiring as much is a level of responsibility that nobody else gets in the military.
04:06:43.06 --> 04:06:49.78 And the result is its initiative and courage. And that initiative encourages part of,
04:06:50.34 --> 04:06:55.78 it's part of their culture. And if you, you know, I, I thought about this for years as I was doing
04:06:55.78 --> 04:07:02.10 this podcast and interviewing people, and what the Marine Corps has is this culture that is rooted
04:07:02.10 --> 04:07:08.26 in the stories of their history. And I think that what you've done with this book
04:07:09.30 --> 04:07:15.14 will strengthen the history of the frogmen and the seal teams. And it'll anchor our culture
04:07:15.86 --> 04:07:23.46 to a past that is filled with these qualities that we want, these qualities of bravery and heroism
04:07:23.46 --> 04:07:31.22 and adaptation and evolution and pride from our successes and humility from our failures. And I
04:07:31.22 --> 04:07:39.54 think this book connects us with the individuals who paved the way for us that we are lucky enough
04:07:39.54 --> 04:07:45.78 to be associated with and lucky enough, really to call our brothers and make this incredible
04:07:45.78 --> 04:07:53.78 group of individuals that we call the teams. And it's an outstanding book. And I think you've done
04:07:53.78 --> 04:07:59.86 a real service to the community by writing this book. And anybody, if you're in the seal teams,
04:07:59.86 --> 04:08:05.06 absolutely just order this book immediately, there's an audio book version which is outstanding as well,
04:08:05.78 --> 04:08:12.10 get this book, anybody that has any interest in any military history in the history of all
04:08:12.10 --> 04:08:18.34 special operations just get this book. There's so much information in it. It's, it's
04:08:18.34 --> 04:08:23.94 immaculately researched. And I just, I couldn't be, I couldn't be more impressed with the man.
04:08:23.94 --> 04:08:31.70 And I'm, look, I feel, I feel somewhat bad because I write books basically from my own head.
04:08:32.34 --> 04:08:38.10 It feels like I have a much easier task than you do. I don't have to read anything. I just
04:08:38.10 --> 04:08:43.38 write what I already know or what I live through. And for you to dive so deep into this, it's just
04:08:43.38 --> 04:08:52.34 outstanding. And I think it's, it's a huge, a huge, a huge service to the teams, man. Thank you.
04:08:52.34 --> 04:08:58.18 So thanks, Ben. Echo Charles, you got anything? Well, I think we covered it.
04:08:59.22 --> 04:09:03.14 Good to see you. Thank you. Nice to see you, yeah. Yeah, that's right.
04:09:03.14 --> 04:09:07.22 Hey, Ben, where can we find you? I know you got it. You got a Twitter, right? Is that,
04:09:07.22 --> 04:09:11.70 is that, is that you much your, your social media extent? I have a Twitter and an Instagram.
04:09:11.70 --> 04:09:16.26 I probably should create a Facebook because I think there's, you know, a few older people that
04:09:16.26 --> 04:09:21.86 would like us. What's your, what's your, I know your Twitter is Ben H. Milligan, right?
04:09:21.86 --> 04:09:29.14 What's your, what's your gram? I'm noted. So please bear with me. I'm, I'm getting better.
04:09:29.14 --> 04:09:36.02 Be Milligan 3. Be Milligan 3. Yeah. Be Milligan. Then I got 3. I've got 3 little boys. So that's, uh,
04:09:36.02 --> 04:09:44.10 okay. Yeah. And, um, do you have a website or anything? I love how I find it. I mean, I mean, I'm not, I'm just like,
04:09:46.50 --> 04:09:51.38 I'm in the most incapable of personal medical and social media promotion. But I always say as
04:09:51.38 --> 04:09:56.02 a same personality traits that make it possible to write this book or the same personality traits,
04:09:56.02 --> 04:10:01.46 make it hard to promote it. So I, um, I'm doing the best I can't, I, I, I appreciate you bringing
04:10:01.46 --> 04:10:06.74 me on here. Uh, the, uh, yeah, I couldn't have done this without lots of people helping out and
04:10:07.14 --> 04:10:11.94 including everybody that, you know, came together to, you know, get this album with Craven, um,
04:10:11.94 --> 04:10:17.62 you know, to, to get that, that blur from him and then, um, you know, I just couldn't have written it
04:10:17.62 --> 04:10:23.62 without just, uh, uh, uh, you know, the supportive, all the people around me, including the,
04:10:23.62 --> 04:10:30.10 the three little guys that I wrote this for. So, you're well, hey, man. Once again, thanks for your,
04:10:30.10 --> 04:10:34.74 thanks for your service and the Navy. Great. Thanks for your service and the teams. Thanks for doing
04:10:34.74 --> 04:10:42.02 what you did, um, and, and really truly, honestly, man. I can't thank you enough for writing this book,
04:10:42.02 --> 04:10:47.30 and it's, it's just, it's just an outstanding document. I hope everybody gets it so much to learn
04:10:47.30 --> 04:10:52.74 and so much respect to be paid to the forefathers that brought us to where we are today.
04:10:52.74 --> 04:11:02.10 Thanks for shining a light on them for us. Thank you. And with that Ben Milligan has left the building,
04:11:03.38 --> 04:11:11.54 uh, echo Charles. Yes, sir. Need to uphold the legacy of the teams by getting better. What
04:11:11.54 --> 04:11:16.74 you got for us first off, first off, I'll side note, me and Ben have history, um, one of the first
04:11:16.74 --> 04:11:24.90 people that I met in San Diego and I moved to, you know, because of a connection between kick
04:11:24.90 --> 04:11:29.94 through, yep, through, uh, my Hawaii people, you know, that came to me to eventually become seals,
04:11:30.58 --> 04:11:34.50 he's well, first of all, he didn't remember you though. Well, the here's the thing we both,
04:11:34.50 --> 04:11:39.62 we both, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, zero is inaccurate, zero is inaccurate. He was like,
04:11:39.62 --> 04:11:44.66 looking at me, I was like, maybe a little something, then later on the break, yeah, we reconnected.
04:11:44.66 --> 04:11:48.10 Yeah, once you described exactly this situation, because he didn't remember you.
04:11:48.82 --> 04:11:52.58 Either way, we're all trying to get better, which is weird. You know, when someone's got such an
04:11:52.58 --> 04:11:57.30 eye for detail, yes, he doesn't remember you at all. That's got to hurt a little bit. Yes,
04:11:57.30 --> 04:12:02.66 especially all the research he's done and all the stuff that his brain is like capable of
04:12:02.66 --> 04:12:11.86 literally even make mustard in the way. Oh, yeah, mustard. Thank you. Either way, we've connected
04:12:11.86 --> 04:12:15.86 now, we're pretty much boys again, so it's all good. And you know, we are trying to get better as
04:12:15.86 --> 04:12:19.54 you mentioned. So boom, we're over here, we're working out, we're working out, we're reading,
04:12:19.54 --> 04:12:23.62 not as much as Ben, but we are most of us, not as much of that, but we're trying
04:12:24.50 --> 04:12:29.46 to stay cognitively and physically in the game and improving ourselves slowly, quickly, whatever.
04:12:29.46 --> 04:12:35.30 So I'm saying through this journey, we need supplementation. Good news, chocolate supplements.
04:12:36.26 --> 04:12:40.98 Call of Jacofuel. First one I'm talking about is the energy drink, new paradigm.
04:12:41.62 --> 04:12:48.98 I said it paradigm, new era of energy drinks. No longer are we burdened, burdened
04:12:49.86 --> 04:12:57.38 with the poisons and the aftermath and the price of bad energy drinks. It's all good. All good.
04:12:57.38 --> 04:13:04.26 Taste good. Give you the little boost we need and healthy for you. Has the electrolytes too,
04:13:04.26 --> 04:13:09.14 by the way, which is that everything electrolytes? Sometimes you need them. Yeah, well, no,
04:13:09.14 --> 04:13:13.62 not to have them, is it thing? Yes, but I don't know if other energy drinks have the electrolytes.
04:13:13.62 --> 04:13:16.82 The thing is, they don't fit because there's too much poison in the now. The one's,
04:13:16.82 --> 04:13:20.66 yeah, sure. Here's the interesting thing. You look at the way the seal teams
04:13:20.66 --> 04:13:26.42 came to fruition, right? There was a gap, there's gaps and some people enter the gap
04:13:26.42 --> 04:13:30.98 but then they leave it, right? I do that. But the seal teams are just there. The UDT's are just
04:13:30.98 --> 04:13:35.70 there. We're staying with it. That's sort of like this whole situation we're finding ourselves in.
04:13:36.10 --> 04:13:40.50 Because there is little gap. Oh, no, everyone wants to make poison because it sells, put a bunch of
04:13:40.50 --> 04:13:44.50 sugar in it, put a bunch of caffeine in it and just give people poison that don't care.
04:13:45.06 --> 04:13:49.46 That's the gap. The gap is like, hey, people might actually want something that's healthy.
04:13:50.26 --> 04:13:54.74 And so I've seen now that we win in the gap, there's other people that are trying to get in there,
04:13:54.74 --> 04:14:00.10 but they don't believe in it. So as soon as they realize how expensive it is, how hard it is to
04:14:00.10 --> 04:14:04.82 produce, as soon as they realize that they just leave the gap. So we're just there, solo operation.
04:14:04.82 --> 04:14:10.18 It's cruising in the sand and tall like the damn seal teams. This is the freaking seal teams of
04:14:10.18 --> 04:14:16.18 drinks right here. Dr. Disco-go. That's what's happening. Oh, yeah, delivering. And that's the thing,
04:14:16.18 --> 04:14:21.46 and you know what? I can't be publishing the mission at all costs. I'm not telling anyone to be offended.
04:14:21.46 --> 04:14:26.50 I'm not saying that. In fact, I would never say that. I'm not telling people to be angry.
04:14:26.50 --> 04:14:32.34 I'll never say that. I can't, I can't impose outrage on somebody. That being said,
04:14:33.14 --> 04:14:40.10 those other entities that created these old school, old era, energy drinks.
04:14:41.06 --> 04:14:44.90 They're kind of playing on your weekend. They're taking us for fools. They're taking advantage.
04:14:44.90 --> 04:14:48.98 They're like, hey, hey, this is taking this tastes real good. You know, the guy in the alley,
04:14:48.98 --> 04:14:53.30 you know, with the red eyes or whatever. It's just because, yeah, hey, take the bro at taste.
04:14:53.30 --> 04:14:57.38 Good, taste good. It's good. It's a nice little boost. Meanwhile, you're like cool. You buy it.
04:14:57.38 --> 04:15:02.58 You drink it. You enjoy the whatever you enjoy. And then later on a one, that guy's long gone.
04:15:03.14 --> 04:15:06.50 You over here paying the price. And it's not even like a lot of your friends.
04:15:06.50 --> 04:15:09.94 Okay. I think did less healthy all this stuff. This and here comes Joko.
04:15:11.14 --> 04:15:13.62 Did it. That's good. Good. Finally.

04:17:30.74 --> 04:17:34.34 They're all going to do. Back there. Like, can you just imagine these guys like,
04:17:34.34 --> 04:17:39.38 hey, we're gonna train you in demolitions, blowing things up underwater, swimming, small boat handling,
04:17:39.38 --> 04:17:46.02 jiu-jitsu, they're doing it all. So get some of that origin USA.com.
04:17:46.02 --> 04:17:50.02 I'll sit out some boots at camp. Hey, look, I'm not gonna go into it.
04:17:50.02 --> 04:17:54.26 Put those or some, you like it, please. Yeah. Impressive. I don't even really wear that
04:17:54.26 --> 04:17:59.70 many, or boots on that many occasions, but down I was like, that could coerce me into wearing boots.
04:17:59.70 --> 04:18:04.90 Look at jiu. As far as coercion goes. Yeah. Orgian us a dot com. But okay. Also,
04:18:04.90 --> 04:18:07.78 joc was a store. It's called joclostaur in this where you can get your discipline. You go
04:18:07.78 --> 04:18:14.74 free to stuff. Hat's hoodies. Shirts. Also good. Also other stuff. This good stuff on there.
04:18:14.74 --> 04:18:18.90 I'm a little development's going on over there. Anyway, joclostaur.com.
04:18:18.90 --> 04:18:22.50 I'm going to you like you're on the top secret mission. You like something. You can get out of the
04:18:22.50 --> 04:18:28.82 National Archives. One echo is creating over here. It's it's top secret until you go there.
04:18:28.82 --> 04:18:33.14 Then it's like boom secret is real secret. But you go on the website. Yes sir.
04:18:33.14 --> 04:18:39.06 I'm able to do everybody. But they can reveal your new shirt. Oh, yeah. You're shirtlock.
04:18:39.06 --> 04:18:45.14 Oh, you like that. Because we're making the shirtlock. The shirtlock if you want a cool t-shirt
04:18:45.14 --> 04:18:50.10 that. And this is this is what I've leaned toward the whole time is shirts that are kind of
04:18:50.10 --> 04:18:56.82 tied to the podcast. And this is one of them right here. The C wolves. 1966 and 1972. By the way,
04:18:56.82 --> 04:19:02.58 commissioned in combat, decommissioned in combat. That's the C wolves. You heard about them today.
04:19:02.58 --> 04:19:07.38 If they will go and get the seals out of the worst possible situation, gunfire. Don't care.
04:19:08.34 --> 04:19:12.18 So how do you get that shirt? Sure. Walker. Yes sir. The one of the
04:19:12.18 --> 04:19:19.38 omages to the seawalls. Yeah, very much. Oh, you can get this at the shirtlocker on Jockel store.

04:19:24.82 --> 04:19:28.98 It's hard for me to explain how cool it is. Very young levels of creativity.
04:19:29.86 --> 04:19:34.74 Either way, it's cool shirt. You get one every month free shipping on that one as well. This is just one of them.
04:19:34.74 --> 04:19:39.54 I got a new feature that we're working on. It should be done. It should be done within the next. I don't know.
04:19:39.54 --> 04:19:45.22 But if you remember the shirtlocker, hey, you look, you missed the shirt. Last month, five months ago,
04:19:45.22 --> 04:19:51.22 whatever. You have the option to get it. If you remember. Oh, you work that on that one.
04:19:51.22 --> 04:19:55.22 The last yes. Very nice. This is the shirt. I'm glad you like it. Jockel seems, you know,
04:19:55.22 --> 04:19:58.66 people seem to like the designs overall. You know, they just want to go and play. Yeah.
04:19:58.66 --> 04:20:04.98 I get a bet. People like that one. A lot. I like that one a lot. Well, because I'm a
04:20:04.98 --> 04:20:09.94 supporter of the C wolves. It's more ample C wolves. Hey, subscribe also to this podcast. We also have

04:26:26.74 --> 04:26:31.70 this incredible book that will solidify our roots, our culture and our history. Can't thank
04:26:31.70 --> 04:26:37.38 you enough and to all the military personnel out there on the front lines right now. Thank you
04:26:37.38 --> 04:26:41.94 for defending our freedom and our way of life and to police and law enforcement firefighters,

04:26:46.26 --> 04:26:54.10 first responders. Thanks for keeping us safe here at home. And everyone else out there. How about
04:26:54.10 --> 04:27:02.50 we all take a little lesson from these frog men? How about we develop and embrace a collective
04:27:02.50 --> 04:27:09.38 value system that emphasizes physical, hardiness and courage and attitude that can press on through
04:27:09.38 --> 04:27:15.30 pain and suffering, a humble intellect that can adapt and overcome a discipline that's unbreakable
04:27:16.66 --> 04:27:25.94 and an unwavering commitment to accomplish the mission. That is the way of the frog men.
04:27:25.94 --> 04:27:35.62 And that is an ideal example to follow and the one that I wake up and face every day.
04:27:35.62 --> 04:28:00.10 To hold the line. And until next time, the Zekko and Joko out.
