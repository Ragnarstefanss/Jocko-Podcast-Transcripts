1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.16
This is Jockel Pontcast number 173.

2
00:00:03.16 --> 00:00:06.34
With echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink.

3
00:00:06.34 --> 00:00:07.60
Good evening, echo.

4
00:00:07.60 --> 00:00:08.60
Good evening.

5
00:00:11.08 --> 00:00:13.80
Sure, analyze the wound.

6
00:00:15.40 --> 00:00:17.64
Wallen was bleeding from his neck.

7
00:00:17.64 --> 00:00:22.48
So he pulled out gauze and started examining the wound to assess the damage.

8
00:00:22.48 --> 00:00:24.52
Wallen's airway looked fine.

9
00:00:24.52 --> 00:00:26.40
There was no vascular damage.

10
00:00:26.40 --> 00:00:29.80
The medic could tell that the wound wasn't life threatening.

11
00:00:29.80 --> 00:00:31.80
But the blood was still flowing.

12
00:00:31.80 --> 00:00:34.28
You're going to be okay, he said.

13
00:00:34.28 --> 00:00:36.04
Rapping gauze on the wound.

14
00:00:36.04 --> 00:00:38.48
He began exerting pressure to stop the bleeding.

15
00:00:38.48 --> 00:00:39.48
Are you sure?

16
00:00:39.48 --> 00:00:40.48
Wallen asked?

17
00:00:40.48 --> 00:00:42.48
Yes, I'm sure.

18
00:00:42.48 --> 00:00:45.48
The fire was nonstop.

19
00:00:45.48 --> 00:00:48.92
Sure didn't think it could get much worse.

20
00:00:48.92 --> 00:00:52.92
Until he heard a frantic call from Walton on the radio.

21
00:00:52.92 --> 00:00:58.80
Bear, Morales and C.K. had been hit and they needed sure up there fast.

22
00:00:58.80 --> 00:00:59.80
Did you hear that?

23
00:00:59.80 --> 00:01:00.80
Wallen asked?

24
00:01:00.80 --> 00:01:01.80
Yeah, I heard it.

25
00:01:01.80 --> 00:01:05.20
Sure, I said.

26
00:01:05.20 --> 00:01:06.72
His bleeding was minimal.

27
00:01:06.72 --> 00:01:08.20
I'm good, Wallen said.

28
00:01:08.20 --> 00:01:10.56
Go get them.

29
00:01:10.56 --> 00:01:14.20
Getting to Walton's team, though, posed a great risk.

30
00:01:14.20 --> 00:01:18.88
A medic is taught not to put himself in any unnecessary danger.

31
00:01:18.88 --> 00:01:23.88
He has to stay alive so other soldiers can live.

32
00:01:23.88 --> 00:01:28.68
But it had reached a point in the battle where he had to go.

33
00:01:28.68 --> 00:01:38.92
Or sure, grabbed his bag and headed into the fire.

34
00:01:38.92 --> 00:01:44.40
And that is a passage from a book called No Way Out, a story of Valor in the Mountains

35
00:01:44.40 --> 00:01:48.12
of Afghanistan by an author named Mitch Weiss.

36
00:01:48.12 --> 00:01:56.56
And it tells the story of the men of operational detachment, Alpha 3336, it's a special forces

37
00:01:56.56 --> 00:02:03.76
odied team going after a high value target in the shock valley in Afghanistan.

38
00:02:03.76 --> 00:02:12.12
But when they got on the ground for this mission, they were in a bad tactical position.

39
00:02:12.12 --> 00:02:13.12
They were outnumbered.

40
00:02:13.12 --> 00:02:15.56
They were outgunned.

41
00:02:15.56 --> 00:02:19.04
But they did have one thing that could not be beaten.

42
00:02:19.04 --> 00:02:20.88
And that was the will to survive.

43
00:02:20.88 --> 00:02:26.52
And the bonds of brotherhood that could not be broken.

44
00:02:26.52 --> 00:02:31.80
And on top of those things, there was incredible courage on display from all the men of the

45
00:02:31.80 --> 00:02:39.88
team above and beyond the Call of Duty and one of those men, the medic, Ron Scher,

46
00:02:39.88 --> 00:02:47.72
not only against the enemy, but fought to save the lives of his teammates.

47
00:02:47.72 --> 00:02:55.08
And it is an absolute honor to have Ron here with us tonight to share some of the lessons

48
00:02:55.08 --> 00:03:02.92
from that day in Afghanistan and from the rest of the things that he's been through

49
00:03:02.92 --> 00:03:08.000
and lived through on his journey through life.

50
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.44
So Ron, thanks for coming on, man.

51
00:03:11.44 --> 00:03:13.24
No, thanks so much for having me.

52
00:03:13.24 --> 00:03:16.28
I've honestly been a fan of the show for a long time.

53
00:03:16.28 --> 00:03:24.28
And you know, when you guys offered kind of weird to think about coming on, but it's

54
00:03:24.28 --> 00:03:25.28
definitely a pleasure.

55
00:03:25.28 --> 00:03:27.36
Well, man, it's great to meet you.

56
00:03:27.36 --> 00:03:30.40
And we'll get to shock Valley.

57
00:03:30.40 --> 00:03:36.32
But let's figure out a little bit about who you were, where you came from, how you grew

58
00:03:36.32 --> 00:03:37.32
up.

59
00:03:37.32 --> 00:03:42.12
I know one interesting fact to start this thing off is that you were born on December 7th,

60
00:03:42.12 --> 00:03:43.12
Pearl Harbor Day.

61
00:03:43.12 --> 00:03:49.000
I was born December 7th, obviously a few years later than in 1941.

62
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.20
But yeah, I grew up with that.

63
00:03:51.20 --> 00:03:55.92
For some reason, my parents always thought it was a good idea to like get me news articles

64
00:03:55.92 --> 00:04:01.84
or other reporting from Pearl Harbor and just as like a six or seven year old, okay, read

65
00:04:01.84 --> 00:04:02.84
this.

66
00:04:02.84 --> 00:04:09.48
I don't know why, but yeah, it always just, you know, was something that we talked about

67
00:04:09.48 --> 00:04:13.28
as part of my birthday.

68
00:04:13.28 --> 00:04:14.28
And happy birthday.

69
00:04:14.28 --> 00:04:16.28
Let me tell you about Pearl Harbor side.

70
00:04:16.28 --> 00:04:17.28
Exactly.

71
00:04:17.28 --> 00:04:18.28
Yeah.

72
00:04:18.28 --> 00:04:22.72
And then your grandfather, was your grandfather in your grandfather's serve?

73
00:04:22.72 --> 00:04:23.72
My grandfather did serve.

74
00:04:23.72 --> 00:04:24.72
He was in the Navy.

75
00:04:24.72 --> 00:04:27.52
So he was in the Pacific for some years.

76
00:04:27.52 --> 00:04:34.32
He, I'm trying to remember, he was on the smaller aircraft carriers that they had on the

77
00:04:34.32 --> 00:04:35.32
Pacific.

78
00:04:35.32 --> 00:04:40.86
So he's on several of those aircraft cancels in, you know, doggian comocosies and for

79
00:04:40.86 --> 00:04:41.86
sure.

80
00:04:41.86 --> 00:04:42.86
Another thing.

81
00:04:42.86 --> 00:04:47.80
I got a bunch of books on, in cue from World War II sailors in World War II.

82
00:04:47.80 --> 00:04:49.68
Those books are absolutely insane.

83
00:04:49.68 --> 00:04:53.16
And what those guys live through was horrific.

84
00:04:53.16 --> 00:04:55.04
I, I look at that.

85
00:04:55.04 --> 00:04:56.72
And maybe this is just me.

86
00:04:56.72 --> 00:04:59.04
I don't know how you feel.

87
00:04:59.04 --> 00:05:06.28
If given the option of being in an engine room on a, on a destroyer in World War II,

88
00:05:06.28 --> 00:05:11.48
hot, sweating and by the way, comocosies, like you said, or two of Peter's going to slam

89
00:05:11.48 --> 00:05:14.56
into you at any time, there's nothing you can do about it.

90
00:05:14.56 --> 00:05:17.20
Versus storming the beach, I'll storm the beach all day long.

91
00:05:17.20 --> 00:05:18.20
Like that's me.

92
00:05:18.20 --> 00:05:19.20
I don't know.

93
00:05:19.20 --> 00:05:20.20
Oh, 100%.

94
00:05:20.20 --> 00:05:25.48
How would rather, you know, in, you know, land warfare combat?

95
00:05:25.48 --> 00:05:29.64
Like if you're in a shoot me, I get a chance to show you back and maybe this will work

96
00:05:29.64 --> 00:05:31.28
out my way, maybe it works out your way.

97
00:05:31.28 --> 00:05:35.80
But we throw water in and all those other other pressures like no thanks.

98
00:05:35.80 --> 00:05:36.80
So I'll pass.

99
00:05:36.80 --> 00:05:41.40
Yeah, I know I owe, I owe it to those sailors to cover some of those books, man.

100
00:05:41.40 --> 00:05:42.40
Those are those books.

101
00:05:42.40 --> 00:05:46.76
But, you know, with your, with your grandfather, I mean, just to live through that, I can't

102
00:05:46.76 --> 00:05:50.64
even imagine coming back from that, what your normal life is like after you've lived

103
00:05:50.64 --> 00:05:55.04
through World War II as a, as a sailor in the Pacific theater.

104
00:05:55.04 --> 00:05:56.32
Oh, man.

105
00:05:56.32 --> 00:05:57.32
Crazy.

106
00:05:57.32 --> 00:06:00.000
Yeah, my grandfather, he served in the Pacific.

107
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:07.28
My great grandfather was in World War I, shooting our cellary at the Germans.

108
00:06:07.28 --> 00:06:13.16
So the family history and, and we have something to tell me, history goes back all the

109
00:06:13.16 --> 00:06:14.16
way to civil war.

110
00:06:14.16 --> 00:06:18.72
It gets a little, you know, a little more like cousin level and every other hair.

111
00:06:18.72 --> 00:06:23.08
But yeah, they, we've been, we've been fighting wars for this country for a long time.

112
00:06:23.08 --> 00:06:24.68
And in both your parents as well.

113
00:06:24.68 --> 00:06:26.20
Both my parents were in the air force.

114
00:06:26.20 --> 00:06:29.28
That's where they actually met was in the air force.

115
00:06:29.28 --> 00:06:33.48
And yeah, we've just had that family history of service.

116
00:06:33.48 --> 00:06:34.48
That was pretty normal.

117
00:06:34.48 --> 00:06:35.92
And where were they stationed?

118
00:06:35.92 --> 00:06:38.28
Would you spend most of your childhood?

119
00:06:38.28 --> 00:06:46.000
I think like most military, you know, kids, you know, I was born in Alaska, but then

120
00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.000
moved to Illinois.

121
00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.44
Don't remember any of either of those places.

122
00:06:50.44 --> 00:06:56.72
First place I remember is Mountain Home Idaho, which is just a tiny little place about

123
00:06:56.72 --> 00:06:58.84
an hour south of Boise.

124
00:06:58.84 --> 00:07:04.24
And then from there, I kind of what we call Washington State home, because I spent fourth

125
00:07:04.24 --> 00:07:05.88
grade on growing up in Washington.

126
00:07:05.88 --> 00:07:07.64
Oh, okay, so a big chunk of time there.

127
00:07:07.64 --> 00:07:13.76
Yeah, my dad and I were hiring in, I was saying 91 from the air force.

128
00:07:13.76 --> 00:07:17.72
And then we just kind of stayed there afterwards.

129
00:07:17.72 --> 00:07:19.56
And you were the only child.

130
00:07:19.56 --> 00:07:20.56
Yeah.

131
00:07:20.56 --> 00:07:24.16
So that means those birthdays were especially heavy.

132
00:07:24.16 --> 00:07:25.16
Right?

133
00:07:25.16 --> 00:07:26.56
You're like, you're a celebrate.

134
00:07:26.56 --> 00:07:27.56
I got four kids.

135
00:07:27.56 --> 00:07:28.56
I know you got two kids.

136
00:07:28.56 --> 00:07:29.56
I got four kids.

137
00:07:29.56 --> 00:07:30.96
And you know, you can have a birthday.

138
00:07:30.96 --> 00:07:33.20
And you don't even, am I a bad parent?

139
00:07:33.20 --> 00:07:34.20
I don't know.

140
00:07:34.20 --> 00:07:35.20
Probably.

141
00:07:35.20 --> 00:07:36.20
Yeah.

142
00:07:36.20 --> 00:07:37.20
Probably.

143
00:07:37.20 --> 00:07:38.20
Do anything for my birthday?

144
00:07:38.20 --> 00:07:39.20
I don't know.

145
00:07:39.20 --> 00:07:40.20
When's your birthday today?

146
00:07:40.20 --> 00:07:41.20
Oh, okay.

147
00:07:41.20 --> 00:07:42.20
Anyways.

148
00:07:42.20 --> 00:07:43.20
It's true.

149
00:07:43.20 --> 00:07:47.20
My wife blows it out for our kids, but she's great at that.

150
00:07:47.20 --> 00:07:48.20
Yeah.

151
00:07:48.20 --> 00:07:49.48
I just kind of go along for the ride.

152
00:07:49.48 --> 00:07:52.04
And my wife doesn't much better job than I do as well.

153
00:07:52.04 --> 00:07:55.76
I'm the person that's looking at the whole situation saying, what is this stuff hanging

154
00:07:55.76 --> 00:07:56.76
up for?

155
00:07:56.76 --> 00:07:57.76
Oh.

156
00:07:57.76 --> 00:07:58.76
What did I get him?

157
00:07:58.76 --> 00:08:00.76
I'm first birthday.

158
00:08:00.76 --> 00:08:02.76
Yeah.

159
00:08:02.76 --> 00:08:05.80
And then, so going to school, what are you playing sports?

160
00:08:05.80 --> 00:08:06.80
What were you doing?

161
00:08:06.80 --> 00:08:09.64
What was your gig in school?

162
00:08:09.64 --> 00:08:14.36
I played the usual sports growing up being a soccer baseball.

163
00:08:14.36 --> 00:08:22.40
What I really kind of gravitated towards is I kept growing up was your endurance sports.

164
00:08:22.40 --> 00:08:23.40
So I started.

165
00:08:23.40 --> 00:08:24.40
My dad was doing triathlon.

166
00:08:24.40 --> 00:08:25.40
So I started doing that.

167
00:08:25.40 --> 00:08:27.40
Oh, your dad was doing triathlon.

168
00:08:27.40 --> 00:08:28.40
So yeah.

169
00:08:28.40 --> 00:08:30.40
He did many triathons.

170
00:08:30.40 --> 00:08:33.16
He did the Canadian Iron Man a couple of times.

171
00:08:33.16 --> 00:08:34.76
And so kind of grew up watching that.

172
00:08:34.76 --> 00:08:38.36
So I started with the triathons in high school.

173
00:08:38.36 --> 00:08:42.80
And then, pretty quickly switched over to just cycling, road racing, cycling.

174
00:08:42.80 --> 00:08:49.92
And I know, I think those four, five, six hour days on a bike got me ready for.

175
00:08:49.92 --> 00:08:50.92
Yes.

176
00:08:50.92 --> 00:08:51.92
No, it's a train.

177
00:08:51.92 --> 00:08:53.76
I just know your name on a bike, right?

178
00:08:53.76 --> 00:08:54.76
Right.

179
00:08:54.76 --> 00:08:55.76
I've never raised a bike before.

180
00:08:55.76 --> 00:08:57.000
But I know guys that race bike.

181
00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.000
And it's just pain.

182
00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
It's just how much pain can you take, right?

183
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.000
Basically.

184
00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:06.48
So long stretch of road and just keep on riding.

185
00:09:06.48 --> 00:09:09.60
And apparently you've gotten some kind of crash.

186
00:09:09.60 --> 00:09:11.60
Like him.

187
00:09:11.60 --> 00:09:13.80
Oh, several times.

188
00:09:13.80 --> 00:09:18.88
Well, I know that I know that there's a little disruption in your plans because you

189
00:09:18.88 --> 00:09:21.40
get done with high school and you want to join the Marine Corps or you get done with

190
00:09:21.40 --> 00:09:22.68
college you want to join the Marine Corps.

191
00:09:22.68 --> 00:09:23.68
Okay.

192
00:09:23.68 --> 00:09:26.04
So yeah, I went to Washington State University.

193
00:09:26.04 --> 00:09:31.20
I was getting ready to graduate in the spring of 2001.

194
00:09:31.20 --> 00:09:37.08
And so started talking to a Marine Corps officer recruiter.

195
00:09:37.08 --> 00:09:38.08
Went to that process.

196
00:09:38.08 --> 00:09:40.84
How did your mom and dad feel about that?

197
00:09:40.84 --> 00:09:41.84
They were.

198
00:09:41.84 --> 00:09:42.84
Because that's face it.

199
00:09:42.84 --> 00:09:43.84
Air Force is one side of this spectrum.

200
00:09:43.84 --> 00:09:47.36
Marine Corps is on the other side of the side of the group.

201
00:09:47.36 --> 00:09:52.64
At least, at least I was going to, I was talking about the officer sign on.

202
00:09:52.64 --> 00:09:58.60
And I later said, hey, I'm joining the Army and listed, then they just lost them there.

203
00:09:58.60 --> 00:10:00.80
Like what are you doing?

204
00:10:00.80 --> 00:10:02.08
You just.

205
00:10:02.08 --> 00:10:06.64
But yeah, so those getting ready to graduate Washington State.

206
00:10:06.64 --> 00:10:10.36
Start talking to the Marine Corps and went through the process.

207
00:10:10.36 --> 00:10:17.08
We basically that was accepted through the Marine Corps program to go to OCS starting

208
00:10:17.08 --> 00:10:20.20
in October of 2001.

209
00:10:20.20 --> 00:10:28.96
But the Navy Medical Board had seen what they thought was a flag on my medical records from

210
00:10:28.96 --> 00:10:31.24
being hit by a car in 1995.

211
00:10:31.24 --> 00:10:38.12
And sorry, I never spent a day in the hospital back then with pancreatitis, which usually

212
00:10:38.12 --> 00:10:45.20
would be considered or related to drug abuse, alcoholism, just something serious.

213
00:10:45.20 --> 00:10:48.20
Or we have some serious medical condition.

214
00:10:48.20 --> 00:10:54.20
And so because that, they told me no, in August of 2001, that now we're good.

215
00:10:54.20 --> 00:10:58.36
We don't need anybody.

216
00:10:58.36 --> 00:11:02.000
So yeah, kind of got less doubt to drive there and then.

217
00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.44
So then what was your plan?

218
00:11:04.44 --> 00:11:06.84
From there, I started to graduate school and I got on.

219
00:11:06.84 --> 00:11:08.12
Which was your original degree in?

220
00:11:08.12 --> 00:11:09.96
I was business economics.

221
00:11:09.96 --> 00:11:11.56
Did you, did you, were you getting that degree?

222
00:11:11.56 --> 00:11:13.28
But you knew you wanted to go in the military?

223
00:11:13.28 --> 00:11:16.96
I mean, you, you ordered you, get down with your degree and say, oh, no, what am I going

224
00:11:16.96 --> 00:11:17.96
to do now?

225
00:11:17.96 --> 00:11:18.96
Maybe I'm going to the Marine Corps.

226
00:11:18.96 --> 00:11:22.96
A little bit of both.

227
00:11:22.96 --> 00:11:28.36
So service was definitely always a part of our family life growing up.

228
00:11:28.36 --> 00:11:31.20
And so it was definitely in the back of my mind.

229
00:11:31.20 --> 00:11:36.28
I need to give back, do something for the country.

230
00:11:36.28 --> 00:11:38.72
Never quite knew what.

231
00:11:38.72 --> 00:11:46.52
And then, yeah, trying to go to OCS, just seeing like something to do for a while and give

232
00:11:46.52 --> 00:11:55.72
back and then when that didn't work out, I started graduate school to use that as kind of

233
00:11:55.72 --> 00:11:58.96
a reset time, I figured out, okay, that's not working out now.

234
00:11:58.96 --> 00:12:00.68
What can I do?

235
00:12:00.68 --> 00:12:07.20
And, you know, it was a few weeks into that that 9-11 happened and then we had to revisit

236
00:12:07.20 --> 00:12:08.20
the decisions again.

237
00:12:08.20 --> 00:12:13.64
And so then what did you do once, what's September 11th happened?

238
00:12:13.64 --> 00:12:22.20
Yeah, I wasn't graduate school for economics and I spent in spending that first year continuing

239
00:12:22.20 --> 00:12:32.32
with education and just watching it on TV and just didn't feel right to just sit there

240
00:12:32.32 --> 00:12:35.80
and watch it.

241
00:12:35.80 --> 00:12:42.40
So try to figure out what made sense at that point to do.

242
00:12:42.40 --> 00:12:48.16
And then for some reason, it was thing in the army, sounded like a good idea.

243
00:12:48.16 --> 00:12:55.80
So that summer of 2002, I went down an army recruiter and of course at that time, they're

244
00:12:55.80 --> 00:12:56.80
like sure, we'll take it.

245
00:12:56.80 --> 00:12:58.80
We can scratch that.

246
00:12:58.80 --> 00:13:00.80
We don't get what medical artists do.

247
00:13:00.80 --> 00:13:01.80
We're good.

248
00:13:01.80 --> 00:13:04.20
That's over here.

249
00:13:04.20 --> 00:13:09.36
Now did you, did you know you wanted to try for us at that point?

250
00:13:09.36 --> 00:13:18.36
They, they talked to me about going in with SF contract and it definitely sounded interesting.

251
00:13:18.36 --> 00:13:29.28
But, and I'll part of me just didn't feel like, like, oh, I could be an SF guy because

252
00:13:29.28 --> 00:13:33.68
I mean, I grow up just like everybody watching Rambo, you're watching other things like

253
00:13:33.68 --> 00:13:35.12
that's what a green beret is like.

254
00:13:35.12 --> 00:13:38.28
I'm certainly don't fit that mold.

255
00:13:38.28 --> 00:13:43.68
But, so they talked about that, but I was like, well, let me get in.

256
00:13:43.68 --> 00:13:48.08
Let me get some experience in the military and then we'll go from there.

257
00:13:48.08 --> 00:13:52.84
So I signed up to be a medic who did basic training.

258
00:13:52.84 --> 00:13:59.76
Oh, I'm pretty in the name right now, Fort Jackson, South Carolina and then went off to Fort

259
00:13:59.76 --> 00:14:05.96
Sam Houston and then went to Airborne School and along that way, I got, I ended up getting

260
00:14:05.96 --> 00:14:13.48
myself a Ranger contract to try and go to the Center for the Rangers.

261
00:14:13.48 --> 00:14:18.48
So at some point you realized, all right, I'm going to step up and try and go to a little

262
00:14:18.48 --> 00:14:20.68
bit more special operation site.

263
00:14:20.68 --> 00:14:21.88
Something got in your head at some point.

264
00:14:21.88 --> 00:14:25.28
Yeah, something got in my head.

265
00:14:25.28 --> 00:14:29.56
And if I remember correctly, I think it was orders to Korea.

266
00:14:29.56 --> 00:14:33.000
And that was my, the first thing that came through.

267
00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.80
Like, let me see what else I could do.

268
00:14:36.80 --> 00:14:44.88
So I talked to the recruiters got the Ranger, I don't know if it was a contract at that

269
00:14:44.88 --> 00:14:46.68
point, but I got that set up.

270
00:14:46.68 --> 00:14:54.04
So it might be different now, but after Airborne School, any infantry guys or medics or

271
00:14:54.04 --> 00:15:01.44
whoever's trying to go to the Ranger, you go out the next day, wait on the little lines

272
00:15:01.44 --> 00:15:05.44
out there at Airborne School and they'd come by, they'd look through your paperwork, pick

273
00:15:05.44 --> 00:15:08.64
you up and then take you over.

274
00:15:08.64 --> 00:15:14.32
So they come out, they start flipping through everybody's stuff and they get to mine and

275
00:15:14.32 --> 00:15:19.48
they start looking at my paperwork, which is still the same paperwork from trying to do

276
00:15:19.48 --> 00:15:21.84
them, Marine Corps, OCS thing.

277
00:15:21.84 --> 00:15:25.28
And so, of course, it's a disaster.

278
00:15:25.28 --> 00:15:30.92
It's, you know, not physically qualified, but then there's lines through that, waivers and

279
00:15:30.92 --> 00:15:36.08
arrows and just don't sense, but they look at that and they're like, well, you're not

280
00:15:36.08 --> 00:15:40.76
physically qualified to be here.

281
00:15:40.76 --> 00:15:45.24
And so they just kind of dropped my paperwork, took everybody else and left me, left

282
00:15:45.24 --> 00:15:47.68
me stand in there.

283
00:15:47.68 --> 00:15:52.000
So now I had to revisit what to do again.

284
00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:59.88
So I ended up spending a few weeks sitting there at Bronze School, just kind of being, you

285
00:15:59.88 --> 00:16:06.36
know, a little, you know, whatever they needed done that sucked, they'd make me do,

286
00:16:06.36 --> 00:16:09.96
while I waited on new orders to go somewhere.

287
00:16:09.96 --> 00:16:17.36
So yeah, we did, I did that for a little while and I finally got orders up to Fort Bragg

288
00:16:17.36 --> 00:16:22.76
to go to the 44th Medical Command.

289
00:16:22.76 --> 00:16:29.84
And so while I was, you know, packing up all my stuff, head up to Fort Bragg, and fortunately

290
00:16:29.84 --> 00:16:33.88
my, my medical records got lost along the way.

291
00:16:33.88 --> 00:16:35.16
Did you say fortunately?

292
00:16:35.16 --> 00:16:36.16
Unfortunately.

293
00:16:36.16 --> 00:16:41.56
I'm a specialist in the army, you know, I don't want to lose stuff and show up, but it

294
00:16:41.56 --> 00:16:44.40
got lost along the way.

295
00:16:44.40 --> 00:16:49.28
So, got my medical paperwork read done, none of that.

296
00:16:49.28 --> 00:16:50.28
Wow.

297
00:16:50.28 --> 00:16:53.72
None of those waivers or anything.

298
00:16:53.72 --> 00:17:01.48
Got all that situated, reported to my unit on, I think it was a Thursday, some Thursday

299
00:17:01.48 --> 00:17:05.84
and August have been 23 at that point.

300
00:17:05.84 --> 00:17:10.64
And that's because those, those army, the medic schools are a long time basically.

301
00:17:10.64 --> 00:17:16.000
So at this point you'd been through boot camp, army boot camp, and then you went to,

302
00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:20.28
to be a medic, how long is the training to be like an infantry medic?

303
00:17:20.28 --> 00:17:21.76
The medic was four months.

304
00:17:21.76 --> 00:17:22.76
Yeah, okay.

305
00:17:22.76 --> 00:17:29.40
So I, yeah, did basic, I did the the medic school, and then, yeah, an airborne school,

306
00:17:29.40 --> 00:17:33.24
and then that interim time while they tried to figure out something to do with me.

307
00:17:33.24 --> 00:17:41.08
And so I showed up to my unit and after you in process in August of 2003, you know,

308
00:17:41.08 --> 00:17:44.96
that first day we do PT, then the first sergeant calls me in, like, hey, what do you

309
00:17:44.96 --> 00:17:47.40
want to do with your life?

310
00:17:47.40 --> 00:17:53.32
And then I'll put it in an SF packet, try this, try something else again, and, and again,

311
00:17:53.32 --> 00:17:55.44
the thing that's true, what's driving you to do that?

312
00:17:55.44 --> 00:18:00.44
Like, did you see some SF guys, did you talk to some SF guys, did you watch Rambo again?

313
00:18:00.44 --> 00:18:03.36
What was the persuading of accurate?

314
00:18:03.36 --> 00:18:17.36
I don't know, I think it was, I'm mixture of a lot of different emotions and, like,

315
00:18:17.36 --> 00:18:23.44
I had nothing to validate my feelings because I was just some specialist in the army,

316
00:18:23.44 --> 00:18:26.60
but I was like, I think I'm pretty good at this stuff.

317
00:18:26.60 --> 00:18:32.000
So let me, let me try and push myself a little bit harder and try and find something else

318
00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:33.000
to do.

319
00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.28
So I put in for SF.

320
00:18:35.28 --> 00:18:39.32
There's a guy named Travis Mills, he wrote a Travis Mills, he's an awesome guy,

321
00:18:39.32 --> 00:18:46.12
but he, he, he was on the podcast and he's a, he's a quadruple amputee and he's like,

322
00:18:46.12 --> 00:18:54.32
the, uh, got the, the damn spirit of a freaking, like the ultimate human being warrior.

323
00:18:54.32 --> 00:18:59.56
But anyways, when he was growing up, he played varsity, football and basketball, whatever

324
00:18:59.56 --> 00:19:04.60
he played every sport, he broke all these records, he was this big strapping guy, like

325
00:19:04.60 --> 00:19:09.40
a total, just a total stud.

326
00:19:09.40 --> 00:19:12.96
And, you know, I asked him, I said, well, you know, how can we didn't try for ranching?

327
00:19:12.96 --> 00:19:16.28
So he said, he, he's like, I, or why don't you try for special forces?

328
00:19:16.28 --> 00:19:18.32
He's like, I didn't think I could make it.

329
00:19:18.32 --> 00:19:25.68
And there's like this thing where like for me, I, I'm, I'm, I'm one eighth of the athlete

330
00:19:25.68 --> 00:19:30.72
and the physical specimen that Travis Mills is, but I was just dumber.

331
00:19:30.72 --> 00:19:34.76
I was just dumb enough to say, oh, I think I can make a piece of straightening, bring it

332
00:19:34.76 --> 00:19:39.52
on, you know, he was too smart to say, you know, he was too smart and then he was too

333
00:19:39.52 --> 00:19:43.20
humble, really, too humble because I had some level of arrogance in me and I think there's

334
00:19:43.20 --> 00:19:48.60
a difference between, because that happens on a fairly regular basis, you know, special

335
00:19:48.60 --> 00:19:55.24
operations and special forces has this kind of mythical buildup where people start to

336
00:19:55.24 --> 00:19:59.000
think, well, I don't know if I can actually make it through that, it's got to be so hard.

337
00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:02.84
Whereas I'm always looking to be like, oh, you were a wrestler or, oh, you played football,

338
00:20:02.84 --> 00:20:07.16
varsity football in your high school or you, you swam on the swim team or whatever,

339
00:20:07.16 --> 00:20:12.04
it'll be fine, like you can do it, but people build it up to that mythical level that

340
00:20:12.04 --> 00:20:13.04
you don't think you can make it.

341
00:20:13.04 --> 00:20:17.20
So the reason I was asking that, because it sounds like you made a transition from, I don't

342
00:20:17.20 --> 00:20:19.76
know if I can do that and then once you're there and you're looking around, you're

343
00:20:19.76 --> 00:20:21.56
going, you know what I think I can actually do that.

344
00:20:21.56 --> 00:20:26.000
You got, you either got Dumber, it's going to be that.

345
00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:29.16
Yeah, or you just got more, you know, and that's what I think it is.

346
00:20:29.16 --> 00:20:34.24
I think it is, you know, you see yourself in comparison with everyone else's there and

347
00:20:34.24 --> 00:20:36.60
you go, okay, cool, I'm, I'm hanging with these guys.

348
00:20:36.60 --> 00:20:37.60
I can probably make this happen.

349
00:20:37.60 --> 00:20:40.40
So, no, that's cool, that's cool.

350
00:20:40.40 --> 00:20:51.12
Yeah, and so, I mean, I say, now we're talking, that fall 2003, so I've gained a sense,

351
00:20:51.12 --> 00:20:57.92
rolling I rack is, is going, at that time, the, the unit I was in, there's a medical

352
00:20:57.92 --> 00:20:58.92
sport company.

353
00:20:58.92 --> 00:21:04.36
They weren't even supposed to deploy, think the calendar had them going on like 2005.

354
00:21:04.36 --> 00:21:07.36
So, like, you're like, that's a lifetime.

355
00:21:07.36 --> 00:21:09.36
I came all the way here.

356
00:21:09.36 --> 00:21:17.24
It's not go anywhere, so, so I put in for selection, we got, we got, got those medical records

357
00:21:17.24 --> 00:21:18.24
are redone.

358
00:21:18.24 --> 00:21:27.60
So, I go, so I went in January of 2004 to selection and, I was talking about that more,

359
00:21:27.60 --> 00:21:33.72
but when I came back, then my unit is all in Desert Camouflage Uniforms and, like, guys,

360
00:21:33.72 --> 00:21:38.44
gone somewhere and there, I got things changed in those three weeks, you were gone, we're

361
00:21:38.44 --> 00:21:39.80
going in like four weeks.

362
00:21:39.80 --> 00:21:40.80
Oh, dang.

363
00:21:40.80 --> 00:21:45.20
So, so you went to special, so they send you, they send you like TAD to special forces

364
00:21:45.20 --> 00:21:46.72
selection, is that what happens?

365
00:21:46.72 --> 00:21:50.96
Like, temporary, they don't transfer you there permanently, they just send you for a, correct.

366
00:21:50.96 --> 00:21:56.04
For the, for the three weeks selection process, you just get temperatures over, you do

367
00:21:56.04 --> 00:22:02.48
your thing, if you get selected, then you wait for orders to go full time to the Q-course.

368
00:22:02.48 --> 00:22:05.08
And then that initial selection is just like a beat down.

369
00:22:05.08 --> 00:22:13.16
Yeah, three weeks, you know, probably not a different than most selections for different

370
00:22:13.16 --> 00:22:14.16
soft units around the world.

371
00:22:14.16 --> 00:22:18.20
You know, walk in the woods with heavy bags, get lost, and then we're going to make

372
00:22:18.20 --> 00:22:25.000
you carry heavy stuff and remember logs, a lot of logs, and then he did carry it permanently,

373
00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:28.20
they didn't belong over here, they belonged over there.

374
00:22:28.20 --> 00:22:32.96
Yeah, how did you do in that, did you feel alright?

375
00:22:32.96 --> 00:22:41.56
I mean, honestly, I didn't know what I was getting myself into, so I obviously passed,

376
00:22:41.56 --> 00:22:47.68
I got selected, but I didn't feel like I was where I wanted to be for that process.

377
00:22:47.68 --> 00:22:54.44
I mean, it definitely beat me up more than I thought it should, and it helped reset me.

378
00:22:54.44 --> 00:23:00.92
So I spent the next couple of months when I was getting ready for those orders, really resetting

379
00:23:00.92 --> 00:23:05.36
the way I was training was getting, getting myself mentally prepared for it.

380
00:23:05.36 --> 00:23:11.96
And so once I got to the face two of the course, I thought that was.

381
00:23:11.96 --> 00:23:12.96
How's it going to you?

382
00:23:12.96 --> 00:23:15.96
You were a little older, because you did college.

383
00:23:15.96 --> 00:23:20.80
And this was 2004, so I was at that point, 25.

384
00:23:20.80 --> 00:23:23.60
Dang, was that older for maybe 20?

385
00:23:23.60 --> 00:23:25.84
Yeah, that was going through.

386
00:23:25.84 --> 00:23:29.04
Not for special forces.

387
00:23:29.04 --> 00:23:37.40
I was definitely one of the oldest guys at basic training when I was going through, but for

388
00:23:37.40 --> 00:23:42.44
special forces, it tends to be those, all the guys who've been in the Army for a little

389
00:23:42.44 --> 00:23:47.40
while have seen stuff got some experience, and then decided they wanted to explore some

390
00:23:47.40 --> 00:23:48.92
different routes.

391
00:23:48.92 --> 00:23:53.12
So you come back from the initial selection course and all your guys from Desert Gaming,

392
00:23:53.12 --> 00:23:55.84
and they're going to end up deploying quickly.

393
00:23:55.84 --> 00:23:57.16
They deployed a couple weeks later.

394
00:23:57.16 --> 00:23:58.52
Dang, the,

395
00:23:58.52 --> 00:24:00.16
do they deploy to Iraq or Afghanistan?

396
00:24:00.16 --> 00:24:01.76
They went to Iraq.

397
00:24:01.76 --> 00:24:06.08
Do they, do they, they run the cash in Baghdad?

398
00:24:06.08 --> 00:24:11.44
Some of them were, they're our East doing, I want to say they were doing Prisoner.

399
00:24:11.44 --> 00:24:12.44
For.

400
00:24:12.44 --> 00:24:16.08
Uh, you know, DTI support.

401
00:24:16.08 --> 00:24:17.08
Operations or whatever.

402
00:24:17.08 --> 00:24:19.68
Not there are some of the prisons.

403
00:24:19.68 --> 00:24:26.60
Luckily, uh, my company commander pulled me in in their office, and basically said, yeah,

404
00:24:26.60 --> 00:24:29.56
you're on these orders.

405
00:24:29.56 --> 00:24:35.08
But if you want to, if you want to go pursue something else, I see some value in that.

406
00:24:35.08 --> 00:24:38.12
So if you want to go, you can go.

407
00:24:38.12 --> 00:24:41.60
And so your company commander took care of you and said you can go to the Q course.

408
00:24:41.60 --> 00:24:42.60
Yeah.

409
00:24:42.60 --> 00:24:43.60
That's awesome.

410
00:24:43.60 --> 00:24:48.40
You know what's cool about that is that guy just leaves a good impression on you about

411
00:24:48.40 --> 00:24:49.40
the Army.

412
00:24:49.40 --> 00:24:54.92
What I mean, I always think that when I was a young, enlisted guy and somebody could

413
00:24:54.92 --> 00:24:59.68
either, you know, maybe screw you over as a hard term, but, you know, some could either

414
00:24:59.68 --> 00:25:03.76
look out for you or just kind of let the big green machine do its thing.

415
00:25:03.76 --> 00:25:07.92
And when someone actually looks out for you, just gives you such a much better appreciation

416
00:25:07.92 --> 00:25:13.000
and connection to, you know, like I had guys that looked out for me when I was a new guy.

417
00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:18.36
And I was that, that just heightens your commitment to the team, you know, that there's

418
00:25:18.36 --> 00:25:19.36
people like that.

419
00:25:19.36 --> 00:25:23.40
Whereas the people that try and, you know, you're just going to do this anyways, need

420
00:25:23.40 --> 00:25:24.40
to the Navy.

421
00:25:24.40 --> 00:25:25.40
That's what they say.

422
00:25:25.40 --> 00:25:27.40
In the Navy, they say needs of the Navy.

423
00:25:27.40 --> 00:25:28.40
Yeah.

424
00:25:28.40 --> 00:25:30.40
Those are the needs of the Navy, so get it.

425
00:25:30.40 --> 00:25:32.16
Well, and you're going to get some.

426
00:25:32.16 --> 00:25:37.40
And so after my company deployed, basically our, our battalion had four companies, two

427
00:25:37.40 --> 00:25:39.88
deployed, two stayed behind.

428
00:25:39.88 --> 00:25:44.48
So we kind of fell under the two that had stayed behind.

429
00:25:44.48 --> 00:25:48.68
And there were some people over there who had that attitude of, you think you're better

430
00:25:48.68 --> 00:25:49.68
than us.

431
00:25:49.68 --> 00:25:50.68
I like, I don't.

432
00:25:50.68 --> 00:25:51.92
I'm just trying something different.

433
00:25:51.92 --> 00:25:58.04
And so they made life interesting for a little while, but we got through it.

434
00:25:58.04 --> 00:25:59.36
And then so what did you train?

435
00:25:59.36 --> 00:26:01.44
What did you change differently about your training?

436
00:26:01.44 --> 00:26:06.04
When you learned from selection like, okay, I need to work on hump and rock more or whatever.

437
00:26:06.04 --> 00:26:09.04
What was the, what were the big things that you learned you needed to work on?

438
00:26:09.04 --> 00:26:16.04
Uh, more weight and moving faster.

439
00:26:16.04 --> 00:26:17.04
Yeah.

440
00:26:17.04 --> 00:26:18.04
Yeah.

441
00:26:18.04 --> 00:26:19.04
I mean, I'm not a big guy.

442
00:26:19.04 --> 00:26:20.04
I'm five six at the time.

443
00:26:20.04 --> 00:26:21.04
I went to selection.

444
00:26:21.04 --> 00:26:24.04
I think I was about 135 pounds.

445
00:26:24.04 --> 00:26:25.04
So you put on that way.

446
00:26:25.04 --> 00:26:26.04
And it's, it's a lot.

447
00:26:26.04 --> 00:26:28.04
So I put on some more weight.

448
00:26:28.04 --> 00:26:33.04
I just got a little more used to moving with that.

449
00:26:33.04 --> 00:26:36.84
Because you got to carry, doesn't matter if you weigh, 220 pounds or 120 pounds.

450
00:26:36.84 --> 00:26:38.04
You got to carry the same weight.

451
00:26:38.04 --> 00:26:39.04
Right.

452
00:26:39.04 --> 00:26:42.04
Yeah, the packing list is what it is, the minimum weight for the day is what it is,

453
00:26:42.04 --> 00:26:46.04
as a matter if you're six foot three or five foot six.

454
00:26:46.04 --> 00:26:49.04
You're just going to go get some.

455
00:26:49.04 --> 00:26:51.04
And then how was the Q course?

456
00:26:51.04 --> 00:26:52.04
Q are since Elvira.

457
00:26:52.04 --> 00:26:54.04
I thought was really, really good course.

458
00:26:54.04 --> 00:27:02.04
I thought it, I thought it did a great job getting you ready for things I had no experience in.

459
00:27:02.04 --> 00:27:06.04
So it's all, it's all changed around a little bit.

460
00:27:06.04 --> 00:27:11.04
Since then, but so for me, when I showed up, you have three of a small unit.

461
00:27:11.04 --> 00:27:19.04
It's tactics, a portion, basically learn how to, you know, be an infantryman, which is from being a medic.

462
00:27:19.04 --> 00:27:22.04
I mean, I had the basic training experience, but I didn't know anything.

463
00:27:22.04 --> 00:27:23.04
Really about that.

464
00:27:23.04 --> 00:27:25.04
So we spent about a month and a half.

465
00:27:25.04 --> 00:27:30.04
She learning how to move with a small unit.

466
00:27:30.04 --> 00:27:35.04
You know, just the basic military drills break contact, initiate ambushes, those things.

467
00:27:35.04 --> 00:27:43.04
And then from there, we started the medical course, which for SMatics is a year.

468
00:27:43.04 --> 00:27:50.04
Basically, just learning every single thing they could teach us in a year.

469
00:27:50.04 --> 00:27:55.04
Of course, trauma, medicine, heavily enforced.

470
00:27:55.04 --> 00:28:03.04
And then, you know, just all the weird and random diseases you might see around the world.

471
00:28:03.04 --> 00:28:08.04
I actually met my future wife during the medic course.

472
00:28:08.04 --> 00:28:15.04
And so when I go see her on the weekends, I'd pull out medical manuals and be like,

473
00:28:15.04 --> 00:28:18.04
I start, you know, start grilling me on these things.

474
00:28:18.04 --> 00:28:24.04
And so she pretends she had whatever random disease you could get from around the world.

475
00:28:24.04 --> 00:28:26.04
It was pretty fun day nights.

476
00:28:26.04 --> 00:28:27.04
It over.

477
00:28:27.04 --> 00:28:31.04
I don't know why she, and she put up with it, but she did.

478
00:28:31.04 --> 00:28:37.04
And so where were you when you, where's that chunk of the course take place?

479
00:28:37.04 --> 00:28:39.04
Is that's 18 Delta, right?

480
00:28:39.04 --> 00:28:41.04
Yeah, 18 Delta.

481
00:28:41.04 --> 00:28:46.04
In the course, all the SF core, the Q course was all based at Fort Bragg.

482
00:28:46.04 --> 00:28:52.04
So I was already at Fort Bragg, so really, much had a move across post when I started.

483
00:28:52.04 --> 00:28:53.04
And then.

484
00:28:53.04 --> 00:28:59.04
Are they, when you're going through 18 Delta, are they still, are you still doing tactical physical

485
00:28:59.04 --> 00:29:00.04
solutions?

486
00:29:00.04 --> 00:29:06.04
Or is it like really starting to get focused on classroom, really focused on the medical aspect of

487
00:29:06.04 --> 00:29:07.04
stuff?

488
00:29:07.04 --> 00:29:11.04
There's a lot of classroom stuff because they got a lot of stuff.

489
00:29:11.04 --> 00:29:12.04
Yeah, you got a lot of stuff.

490
00:29:12.04 --> 00:29:13.04
They got a lot of stuff.

491
00:29:13.04 --> 00:29:18.04
Teach you, but they do, they also do a great job of pulling out the woods.

492
00:29:18.04 --> 00:29:20.04
And.

493
00:29:20.04 --> 00:29:24.04
I can't remember all the different segments of the course.

494
00:29:24.04 --> 00:29:25.04
We have a comment at trauma lanes.

495
00:29:25.04 --> 00:29:31.04
You have just so many different portions where you get used to training people out in, out

496
00:29:31.04 --> 00:29:32.04
on the dirt.

497
00:29:32.04 --> 00:29:35.04
And I remember.

498
00:29:35.04 --> 00:29:42.04
Sorry, I think I started that course in August, September of 2004.

499
00:29:42.04 --> 00:29:45.04
And so we were rolling through the winter.

500
00:29:45.04 --> 00:29:50.04
And I still just think they remember being out in the woods in January when it's like

501
00:29:50.04 --> 00:29:52.04
15 degrees and you're the patient.

502
00:29:52.04 --> 00:29:54.04
And you know, like somebody's working on you.

503
00:29:54.04 --> 00:29:59.04
You know, to practice, you know, like, please do it faster.

504
00:29:59.04 --> 00:30:06.04
So I can get out of this because, you know, how do you treat a patient who's wounded.

505
00:30:06.04 --> 00:30:08.04
You have to expose.

506
00:30:08.04 --> 00:30:10.04
Remove it as well.

507
00:30:10.04 --> 00:30:15.04
So they be going through stuff and they be like, you know, do you feel this or do you feel

508
00:30:15.04 --> 00:30:16.04
that?

509
00:30:16.04 --> 00:30:21.04
And like the patient saying yes, but no, I don't feel that because my, my feet are frozen

510
00:30:21.04 --> 00:30:23.04
right now.

511
00:30:23.04 --> 00:30:26.04
But so it was, it was a great course.

512
00:30:26.04 --> 00:30:35.04
We did two one month blocks where you got to hospitals around the country and

513
00:30:35.04 --> 00:30:40.04
work in the ERs or work with anywhere in the hospital.

514
00:30:40.04 --> 00:30:45.04
OBE just different aspects of go to the local fire.

515
00:30:45.04 --> 00:30:49.04
House is right on the ambulances get those experiences.

516
00:30:49.04 --> 00:30:55.04
So yeah, the medical training that the and and the seals used to go to 18 Delta

517
00:30:55.04 --> 00:30:58.04
our seal corpsmen used to go to 18 Delta.

518
00:30:58.04 --> 00:30:59.04
They don't anymore now.

519
00:30:59.04 --> 00:31:01.04
They have a separate course.

520
00:31:01.04 --> 00:31:02.04
Okay.

521
00:31:02.04 --> 00:31:08.04
But the training that they got and the training that that course provided is just awesome training.

522
00:31:08.04 --> 00:31:15.04
I mean, it's legendary awesome training and who knows how many lives have been saved

523
00:31:15.04 --> 00:31:20.04
guys went through that that block of training and we're just so good.

524
00:31:20.04 --> 00:31:25.04
And at doing all this stuff under a poncho at night, stop and bleeding, working on, you know,

525
00:31:25.04 --> 00:31:29.04
healing people with all kinds of, you know, in the, in the, in the,

526
00:31:29.04 --> 00:31:34.04
in the dirt like you said, all that stuff, there's the training that they prepped our medical

527
00:31:34.04 --> 00:31:36.04
guys for was phenomenal.

528
00:31:36.04 --> 00:31:37.04
Yeah.

529
00:31:37.04 --> 00:31:44.04
I was super impressed having been a medic before and then kind of stepping.

530
00:31:44.04 --> 00:31:51.04
And up a level like that, it was, it was really, really nice to see where we're going to

531
00:31:51.04 --> 00:31:52.04
take a year.

532
00:31:52.04 --> 00:31:55.04
We're going to really take our time.

533
00:31:55.04 --> 00:31:59.04
Teach you everything you need to know from the ground up.

534
00:31:59.04 --> 00:32:06.04
Yeah, and just continue to build those basics, you know, from starting early on with, you know,

535
00:32:06.04 --> 00:32:11.04
classes, sticks and rags like, okay, everything else is going to be great.

536
00:32:11.04 --> 00:32:16.04
Teach you that stuff, but, you know, sometimes this is literally just a stick in a

537
00:32:16.04 --> 00:32:17.04
rag.

538
00:32:17.04 --> 00:32:18.04
You can stop a lot of stuff.

539
00:32:18.04 --> 00:32:21.04
You can save a lot of people as long as you've had that experience.

540
00:32:21.04 --> 00:32:26.04
And then, of course, moving on later to, you usually keep a static agency, you know,

541
00:32:26.04 --> 00:32:31.04
like quick plot or something to really stop, but like, okay, this is easy now.

542
00:32:31.04 --> 00:32:38.04
Because I had to stop it last week with literally go find a stick and cut up, cut up some clothes.

543
00:32:38.04 --> 00:32:42.04
Yeah, yeah, teach it.

544
00:32:42.04 --> 00:32:46.04
Now you're giving me actual materials, like, okay, I got this.

545
00:32:46.04 --> 00:32:49.04
Going back to the Q Course, the initial kick off of the Q Course, was there anything that you had major issues with?

546
00:32:49.04 --> 00:32:54.04
What do you mean, like, when you were going through, not selection, but through the Q Course,

547
00:32:54.04 --> 00:32:56.04
was there anything that you were like, I'm not going to make it through this.

548
00:32:56.04 --> 00:32:57.04
I'm going to fail this.

549
00:32:57.04 --> 00:32:58.04
I'm not good enough with this.

550
00:32:58.04 --> 00:33:00.04
Like, for me, I wasn't really good at anything.

551
00:33:00.04 --> 00:33:06.04
I was like, everything that I did, because basically, every week, going through

552
00:33:06.04 --> 00:33:12.04
training, you get tested on, you get a timed run, you get a timed swim, you get a timed obstacle course.

553
00:33:12.04 --> 00:33:17.04
And then there's usually some kind of a water evolution that they're going to test you on,

554
00:33:17.04 --> 00:33:21.04
whether it's underwater, not tying or lifesaving or breath hold or whatever.

555
00:33:21.04 --> 00:33:24.04
They've got these evolutions for you and they're stacked up.

556
00:33:24.04 --> 00:33:28.04
And that's one of the biggest pressures that that I felt going through was,

557
00:33:28.04 --> 00:33:33.04
if you, for me, like, to pass a formal timed run, which that when I went through,

558
00:33:33.04 --> 00:33:36.04
the runs were not for miles.

559
00:33:36.04 --> 00:33:38.04
They were however long they happened to be that day.

560
00:33:38.04 --> 00:33:39.04
They might be 3.8.

561
00:33:39.04 --> 00:33:41.04
They might be 4.6.

562
00:33:41.04 --> 00:33:44.04
No one knew soft sand, high tide.

563
00:33:44.04 --> 00:33:50.04
And I failed one run, because I decided I was going to pace myself.

564
00:33:50.04 --> 00:33:52.04
And that was not smart.

565
00:33:52.04 --> 00:33:53.04
And after that one run, then I failed.

566
00:33:53.04 --> 00:33:56.04
I just had to go as hard as I could for the whole time.

567
00:33:56.04 --> 00:33:58.04
I'd said to sprint, this hard as I could, and then I'd pass.

568
00:33:58.04 --> 00:34:00.04
And it was kind of the same thing for everything.

569
00:34:00.04 --> 00:34:02.04
Like, I just had to go hard.

570
00:34:02.04 --> 00:34:06.04
But, you know, I was worried that, oh, I might fail another swim.

571
00:34:06.04 --> 00:34:07.04
I might fail.

572
00:34:07.04 --> 00:34:11.04
Was there anything where you were thinking to yourself, man, if I don't, if I don't pay attention,

573
00:34:11.04 --> 00:34:14.04
I might not make it through this training?

574
00:34:14.04 --> 00:34:21.04
Uh, I'll say any of the, any of the time we're out in the woods doing infantry stuff,

575
00:34:21.04 --> 00:34:24.04
because I just, I didn't have that experience.

576
00:34:24.04 --> 00:34:31.04
Uh, I worked my butt off, trying to learn, trying to pick up, follow the guys, like,

577
00:34:31.04 --> 00:34:36.04
okay, that guy has been a ranger school. He's done this. He's done, he's done, he's done, he's done, he's done a combat to point me.

578
00:34:36.04 --> 00:34:37.04
Let me, yeah.

579
00:34:37.04 --> 00:34:42.04
I'm hanging out a little closer to that guy and see, see what he does when we're setting up a patrol base.

580
00:34:42.04 --> 00:34:44.04
Those kind of things.

581
00:34:44.04 --> 00:34:51.04
Honestly, I think, like a lot of people, I have that two sides of the, the coin, I mean,

582
00:34:51.04 --> 00:34:56.04
I have that little bit of dumb arrogance, like I think I can do this,

583
00:34:56.04 --> 00:35:03.04
but then I also have that, I don't belong anywhere near these guys, like these guys are,

584
00:35:03.04 --> 00:35:07.04
you know, they've been there, actually done that. I've, what have I done?

585
00:35:07.04 --> 00:35:11.04
Um, so I was always trying to find that balance internal, you know,

586
00:35:11.04 --> 00:35:15.04
yeah, I can do this or, or, or know I can't.

587
00:35:15.04 --> 00:35:18.04
I guess that's a big difference between when you go through seal training,

588
00:35:18.04 --> 00:35:23.04
pretty much everyone's going through training is not been,

589
00:35:23.04 --> 00:35:27.04
that not done anything before. So even, because if you might have been the regular Navy,

590
00:35:27.04 --> 00:35:30.04
but even most guys haven't even been the regular Navy, most guys are just, you go through

591
00:35:30.04 --> 00:35:33.04
boot camp, you go through prep course and then you go show up at Buds and that's it.

592
00:35:33.04 --> 00:35:36.04
That's, that's what you do. So there's no, you're not looking anyone going on

593
00:35:36.04 --> 00:35:39.04
out of the sky, this guy's done stuff before anything like that.

594
00:35:39.04 --> 00:35:44.04
And also, you're not doing anything in, in basic seal training,

595
00:35:44.04 --> 00:35:51.04
you're just, there's no tactical, there's, there's barely any tactical knowledge

596
00:35:51.04 --> 00:35:56.04
being taught at all. It's like, carry this boat on your head for a long time.

597
00:35:56.04 --> 00:36:00.04
And it's going to hurt a lot. And then when it hurts a lot, keep going.

598
00:36:00.04 --> 00:36:04.04
Right. And I mean, SF definitely has that aspect too.

599
00:36:04.04 --> 00:36:09.04
Like if we find the right people, we can train you at any point on what we want you to do,

600
00:36:09.04 --> 00:36:12.04
but we just got to make sure, you know, you're not going to, you're not going to

601
00:36:12.04 --> 00:36:18.04
quit on us. And I don't know, I think just along the way, I was just,

602
00:36:18.04 --> 00:36:24.04
I was too stubborn to, to quit, definitely. I definitely wanted to all the time,

603
00:36:24.04 --> 00:36:28.04
but it wasn't any given the satisfaction.

604
00:36:28.04 --> 00:36:32.04
Yeah. And then so then you get done with that.

605
00:36:32.04 --> 00:36:35.04
You get done with a Q course. You get done with 18 Delta.

606
00:36:35.04 --> 00:36:40.04
And then when do you get, when do they give you your green bar A?

607
00:36:40.04 --> 00:36:47.04
So for us, I ended up finishing the entire Q course in May of 2006.

608
00:36:47.04 --> 00:36:50.04
So I done selection in January of 2004.

609
00:36:50.04 --> 00:36:53.04
Had a couple months break while I waited on orders.

610
00:36:53.04 --> 00:36:57.04
Started the Q course proper in June of 2004.

611
00:36:57.04 --> 00:37:00.04
And then May of 2006 when I graduated.

612
00:37:00.04 --> 00:37:02.04
Dang, that's a long pipeline, isn't it?

613
00:37:02.04 --> 00:37:06.04
It's a long pipeline. That's, that's zero recycled.

614
00:37:06.04 --> 00:37:12.04
That's zero getting injured. That's just, that's just what it is.

615
00:37:12.04 --> 00:37:17.04
All the other jobs are, they teach you the job at about three months,

616
00:37:17.04 --> 00:37:20.04
whereas the medic, they teach it in 12 months.

617
00:37:20.04 --> 00:37:25.04
So everybody else can be that much shorter than the NAR pipeline.

618
00:37:25.04 --> 00:37:30.04
But so it was the May. That's when I got the green bar A graduated,

619
00:37:30.04 --> 00:37:35.04
the Q course got my orders over to a third group.

620
00:37:35.04 --> 00:37:37.04
Did you, were you married? Did you get married yet?

621
00:37:37.04 --> 00:37:43.04
So graduated the Q course in May of 2006.

622
00:37:43.04 --> 00:37:51.04
Right, yeah. And so I got that couple week break before reporting to my unit.

623
00:37:51.04 --> 00:37:55.04
My wife and I got engaged. Then.

624
00:37:55.04 --> 00:38:00.04
So I reported over to third group towards the end of June of 2006.

625
00:38:00.04 --> 00:38:03.04
And they say, hey, go over to third battalion.

626
00:38:03.04 --> 00:38:08.04
They're going to get you slotted, third battalion's like, hey, go to Charlie company.

627
00:38:08.04 --> 00:38:11.04
And I show up to Charlie company three, three.

628
00:38:11.04 --> 00:38:16.04
And there's, there's nobody there. Like, my, the first guy here.

629
00:38:16.04 --> 00:38:20.04
They're like, what's going on? And there was one guy in there.

630
00:38:20.04 --> 00:38:25.04
And he's like, oh, everybody's on block leave because we're going to Afghanistan in a couple weeks.

631
00:38:25.04 --> 00:38:31.04
So I went home, told Miranda the situation.

632
00:38:31.04 --> 00:38:35.04
And so we were going to get a quicky marriage.

633
00:38:35.04 --> 00:38:39.04
But we didn't want to have to try and plan while I was gone.

634
00:38:39.04 --> 00:38:48.04
And then there's also those aspects of, you know, military doesn't give a damn about some girlfriend or fiance or anything.

635
00:38:48.04 --> 00:38:56.04
And so we, you know, we decided, you know, she wants, you know, an actual wedding ring and actual dress.

636
00:38:56.04 --> 00:38:59.04
You know, at least few things can we get them done.

637
00:38:59.04 --> 00:39:02.04
We got it done. So we got married and then I'd.

638
00:39:02.04 --> 00:39:05.04
You'd see, didn't do a quick wedding. But you got married in two weeks.

639
00:39:05.04 --> 00:39:08.04
So it was like three weeks.

640
00:39:08.04 --> 00:39:09.04
That's awesome.

641
00:39:09.04 --> 00:39:12.04
It wasn't like a low-prout away.

642
00:39:12.04 --> 00:39:13.04
Yeah.

643
00:39:13.04 --> 00:39:17.04
Because we'd been together a year and a half at that point.

644
00:39:17.04 --> 00:39:22.04
So yeah, it wasn't quick, but it was pretty quick.

645
00:39:22.04 --> 00:39:23.04
It's awesome.

646
00:39:23.04 --> 00:39:30.04
Did you did your family? How'd you tell your family?

647
00:39:30.04 --> 00:39:32.04
That text message.

648
00:39:32.04 --> 00:39:38.04
At that point, it texts really were there because you had to type so many, you know, to just kind of message.

649
00:39:38.04 --> 00:39:41.04
So we ended up bringing her parents and my parents.

650
00:39:41.04 --> 00:39:42.04
Oh, that's awesome.

651
00:39:42.04 --> 00:39:43.04
They actually came out.

652
00:39:43.04 --> 00:39:44.04
Yeah.

653
00:39:44.04 --> 00:39:45.04
Oh, okay.

654
00:39:45.04 --> 00:39:46.04
Yeah, we actually went.

655
00:39:46.04 --> 00:39:49.04
Where do you do non-quicky quick marriage?

656
00:39:49.04 --> 00:39:50.04
Vegas.

657
00:39:50.04 --> 00:39:52.04
So we don't can't met up there.

658
00:39:52.04 --> 00:39:53.04
Oh, so.

659
00:39:53.04 --> 00:39:55.04
So you did a Vegas wedding.

660
00:39:55.04 --> 00:39:57.04
And we're still going.

661
00:39:57.04 --> 00:40:00.04
I mean, what this summer will be 13 years short.

662
00:40:00.04 --> 00:40:01.04
I saw that.

663
00:40:01.04 --> 00:40:03.04
So yes, we got married.

664
00:40:03.04 --> 00:40:08.04
Did you request permission from your, uh, sergeant to get married?

665
00:40:08.04 --> 00:40:10.04
I did not.

666
00:40:10.04 --> 00:40:11.04
I didn't even meet him.

667
00:40:11.04 --> 00:40:13.04
So you went and let you out of the compound.

668
00:40:13.04 --> 00:40:15.04
I just went on because nobody was there.

669
00:40:15.04 --> 00:40:17.04
So they just put me as soon as I showed up.

670
00:40:17.04 --> 00:40:19.04
I went right back on leave.

671
00:40:19.04 --> 00:40:21.04
Kind of got married and then showed back up.

672
00:40:21.04 --> 00:40:23.04
Did some training and then.

673
00:40:23.04 --> 00:40:25.04
Better bunch of guys.

674
00:40:25.04 --> 00:40:28.04
For the first time and deployed for seven months with him.

675
00:40:28.04 --> 00:40:29.04
Day.

676
00:40:29.04 --> 00:40:32.04
And what was that first deployment like?

677
00:40:32.04 --> 00:40:35.04
Uh, the first deployment.

678
00:40:35.04 --> 00:40:37.04
Was.

679
00:40:37.04 --> 00:40:40.04
Compared to my second deployment, it was fairly tame.

680
00:40:40.04 --> 00:40:42.04
Uh, that.

681
00:40:42.04 --> 00:40:43.04
I've fallen.

682
00:40:43.04 --> 00:40:46.04
Fall 2006 into 2007.

683
00:40:46.04 --> 00:40:48.04
Time for a man of Afghanistan.

684
00:40:48.04 --> 00:40:50.04
We were, we were working with the, the Afghans, you know, doing that stuff.

685
00:40:50.04 --> 00:40:52.04
Something partner with them during them.

686
00:40:52.04 --> 00:40:54.04
Take a mile on missions.

687
00:40:54.04 --> 00:40:59.04
Uh, I don't know which we, which is ended up in, uh,

688
00:40:59.04 --> 00:41:00.04
guard as Afghanistan.

689
00:41:00.04 --> 00:41:03.04
And for some reason, was it's hard to find.

690
00:41:03.04 --> 00:41:04.04
Trouble.

691
00:41:04.04 --> 00:41:05.04
You're then.

692
00:41:05.04 --> 00:41:08.04
I mean, obviously things happen flow in different areas.

693
00:41:08.04 --> 00:41:09.04
And.

694
00:41:09.04 --> 00:41:13.04
But just at that time, we really couldn't find too much work.

695
00:41:13.04 --> 00:41:17.04
So were you guys, you guys were training up these, uh, Afghan national police.

696
00:41:17.04 --> 00:41:22.04
And build relationships with them. And then you'd go out and do some kind of missions with them.

697
00:41:22.04 --> 00:41:25.04
But the a.o. that you were in was relatively tame at the time.

698
00:41:25.04 --> 00:41:26.04
Yeah.

699
00:41:26.04 --> 00:41:31.04
So, uh, we work with the, the army and the, and the police.

700
00:41:31.04 --> 00:41:35.04
Just training them up trying to get them ready to take over their country.

701
00:41:35.04 --> 00:41:39.04
Because that's the SF mission is to, you're training you up.

702
00:41:39.04 --> 00:41:42.04
So you can do the job. And I can, I can go home.

703
00:41:42.04 --> 00:41:46.04
Um, you know, obviously all of us have guys want to be the guy to go in and.

704
00:41:46.04 --> 00:41:49.04
You know, pull up the doors and go in and clear it all yourselves.

705
00:41:49.04 --> 00:41:54.04
But the SF mission is to, you know, get somebody else to go do it for themselves.

706
00:41:54.04 --> 00:41:55.04
Yeah.

707
00:41:55.04 --> 00:41:56.04
Yeah.

708
00:41:56.04 --> 00:41:57.04
That's it for those of you that don't know.

709
00:41:57.04 --> 00:42:04.04
That's the, that is the tenant, the bit that's the mission of the, of the special forces of the green braises to work with the.

710
00:42:04.04 --> 00:42:09.04
Whatever nation you're in, you build up their forces, you help them, you train them prepare them.

711
00:42:09.04 --> 00:42:11.04
And, and then you advise them out on the battlefield.

712
00:42:11.04 --> 00:42:14.04
And hopefully with your goal of allowing them to.

713
00:42:14.04 --> 00:42:20.04
Eventually not need your advisement anymore. That's what that's what the primary mission of the special forces is.

714
00:42:20.04 --> 00:42:25.04
And well, in the sealed teams, we end up doing that as well.

715
00:42:25.04 --> 00:42:27.04
You know, we, I don't know.

716
00:42:27.04 --> 00:42:30.04
Ah, I'm trying to think of when we actually started getting tasked with that.

717
00:42:30.04 --> 00:42:37.04
But, you know, that's what we do now to, you know, we probably, we lean towards, you know, direct action in special reconnaissance.

718
00:42:37.04 --> 00:42:43.04
That's kind of where we learn, learn lean towards you guys lean more towards, you know, training up guerrilla forces.

719
00:42:43.04 --> 00:42:49.04
But there's a lot of crossover and, you know, all of us do everyone else's job to the best of our ability.

720
00:42:49.04 --> 00:42:59.04
But, did you, did you feel like the deployment was like, what was your satisfaction, was your personal satisfaction level of that deployment?

721
00:42:59.04 --> 00:43:08.04
I, I think like most as I have guys who just gone through a long train up, you've got all this experience, you're here,

722
00:43:08.04 --> 00:43:18.04
you're here, you're here to go and I, I'd to play a man. I mean, it was a good trip, but it was, it was a little quieter than I think most of the team would have liked.

723
00:43:18.04 --> 00:43:23.04
You know, if you're going to be gone and you're going to miss your family for seven months.

724
00:43:23.04 --> 00:43:26.04
So would you guys, would you take them out to hit targets?

725
00:43:26.04 --> 00:43:31.04
And there just would be, you'd capture your bad guy or yes or no, but they'd, they'd weren't putting up resistance.

726
00:43:31.04 --> 00:43:37.04
Yeah, we, we did villages, we, we'd go, we caught plenty of bad guys.

727
00:43:37.04 --> 00:43:54.04
Just they, at, at that point, I don't know, I think it was this kind of a weird point in the war where the, back guys really, they could quickly spot this as F and they didn't really want too much to do with us.

728
00:43:54.04 --> 00:44:02.04
So they just, you know, we'll pass today, we'll find another unit to attack.

729
00:44:02.04 --> 00:44:16.04
But yeah, just, yeah, we caught, we caught guys, they just always went pretty quickly. I mean, we, we got in, we'd get into a couple, you know, couple.

730
00:44:16.04 --> 00:44:24.04
Yeah, just a couple contact over there, but it was, yeah, overall was just kind of quite area at that time.

731
00:44:24.04 --> 00:44:36.04
And was it winter time? So showed up there in August of 2006 and we stayed till March of 2, though, I don't want to say March of 2007.

732
00:44:36.04 --> 00:44:42.04
So yeah, it was, is that winter when you kind of have that wall anyways of the winter time?

733
00:44:42.04 --> 00:44:45.04
Yeah, and like you said, I mean, things just go up and down cycles go up and down.

734
00:44:45.04 --> 00:44:53.04
People, the enemy gets agitated or they get beat down and they take a tactical breath for a few months or whatever.

735
00:44:53.04 --> 00:45:02.04
And then you come home from that deployment and you're, so then what happens? What's the life of the next F guy when you come home from that deployment?

736
00:45:02.04 --> 00:45:04.04
You're going to start to work up to get ready to play again.

737
00:45:04.04 --> 00:45:08.04
Yeah, we already knew when we were going again.

738
00:45:08.04 --> 00:45:21.04
Basically, the, at the time there was three battalion Zanerps standing up a fort battalion in the group. So kind of two battalions would be on the next rotation, one would be down.

739
00:45:21.04 --> 00:45:29.04
So it just happened that my battalion had to, to back to back so to speak. So we had seven on seven off and then seven on again.

740
00:45:29.04 --> 00:45:33.04
So we knew right away. So we got back when we're going.

741
00:45:33.04 --> 00:45:37.04
And then do you try and cram into a quick work up into that time period?

742
00:45:37.04 --> 00:45:50.04
Of course. So, you know, you got back. So you got a first refit, get everything resituated, make sure, make sure, you know, all the stuff you broke is fixed.

743
00:45:50.04 --> 00:46:04.04
Uh, kind of, you know, take a little bit of time just to decompress and then start the train up and, you know, we got, got a few new guys in on the team.

744
00:46:04.04 --> 00:46:15.04
We got a new team sergeant. We got a new team leader, a couple other new guys and, you know, just getting everybody ready, getting on the same page.

745
00:46:15.04 --> 00:46:44.04
And then we, the team sergeant, we got, then Scott Ford, he was great coming from, he'd come from the training, he'd come from some, some different SF teams that had been over to Iraq and Afghanistan and had been there, you know, early on in the war when it was, it's a lot. So he, he put us through a lot of training got us, got us much more prepared than, we were prepared for the first trip, but we were even better for the second one.

746
00:46:44.04 --> 00:46:49.04
Yeah, we finished up that training, do a little bit more.

747
00:46:49.04 --> 00:46:58.04
How the boys like that when you had the, the new team sergeant coming in and he's all fired up to push you guys hard and training was any push back from that.

748
00:46:58.04 --> 00:47:24.04
Of course, all of us are, you know, SF guys and a little bit like, you know, even though he's, teams are, he's been around forever. Who's this new guy coming on the team, trying to tell us all what to do, like, but, you know, it didn't take very long to see, okay, he's got all this great experience in, and the training that he's putting us through was, was definitely getting us right.

749
00:47:24.04 --> 00:47:34.04
And how much, how much support do you guys get for training? So do they set, do, are you going through organized training? Are you guys running all the training yourselves?

750
00:47:34.04 --> 00:47:52.04
It's the company does coordinate some stuff, but most of it's just have a team level. So, you know, the team sergeant's kind of, in coordination with the team leader is kind of guiding the team, where they want him to be, but then.

751
00:47:52.04 --> 00:48:03.04
As SF is broken down, you have your, your weapons sergeants who are, you know, supposed to be your weapons experts, you have your engineers who, you know, handle the demolitions and those things.

752
00:48:03.04 --> 00:48:20.04
Your communications guys and your medics. And so depending on the day it might be my day to teach. So I'm going to get two days this week to just put everybody through many medical course, get them, get them ready just in case.

753
00:48:20.04 --> 00:48:25.04
You know, some happens I can't get there or some happens me or something like that.

754
00:48:25.04 --> 00:48:34.04
So everybody, everybody is a subject matter expert and just kind of tries to, tries to lift that whole team up to be the best.

755
00:48:34.04 --> 00:48:45.04
They can be, there's no, obviously each job is the best at their job. You want to know as much as you can about everything.

756
00:48:45.04 --> 00:48:57.04
So that way, you know, when things go wrong, and that point it was kind of still theoretical to me, but yeah, when things went wrong, okay, I can handle this.

757
00:48:57.04 --> 00:49:05.04
And then you guys already knew when you're going to find it and you did you know where you're going on the planet as well.

758
00:49:05.04 --> 00:49:09.04
I don't remember when we found out what our next mission was.

759
00:49:09.04 --> 00:49:15.04
I can't remember if it was early on or it was late. I think it was fairly early on in our buildup.

760
00:49:15.04 --> 00:49:23.04
That we knew we were going to be working this time with the Afghan Commandos, which was a fairly new thing at the time.

761
00:49:23.04 --> 00:49:27.04
It was right on that time that the SF teams had just started.

762
00:49:27.04 --> 00:49:33.04
I keep working to go through selection for the Afghan army. We're going to get the best we can. We're going to train them up more.

763
00:49:33.04 --> 00:49:39.04
And these Afghan Commandos battalions and they're going to be the SF of Afghanistan.

764
00:49:39.04 --> 00:49:49.04
So I can't remember exactly when, but we knew we were going to be partnering with those guys to do a little bit more of this trip.

765
00:49:49.04 --> 00:49:54.04
So your expectation was that things were going to be a little bit hotter on the second deployment.

766
00:49:54.04 --> 00:49:55.04
Correct.

767
00:49:55.04 --> 00:50:02.04
Did you believe that as a as like one cruise wonder, guy that don't don't want to implement, are you like things going to be hotter?

768
00:50:02.04 --> 00:50:06.04
Or were you just thinking hey, it's going to be the same as last time?

769
00:50:06.04 --> 00:50:20.04
Uh, I think we all thought it was going to be a little bit more this trip just because my first trip, it was you kind of had a little bit more of a region that your team was.

770
00:50:20.04 --> 00:50:22.04
So it just depends on what your region is doing.

771
00:50:22.04 --> 00:50:24.04
God, it was this commandos could go anywhere.

772
00:50:24.04 --> 00:50:28.04
The commandos, they were still fairly new so there wasn't that many.

773
00:50:28.04 --> 00:50:39.04
So over the course of the second my second deployment and we spent time in eastern Afghanistan, we spent time down to Kandahar, we spent time just going wherever they needed another battalion because.

774
00:50:39.04 --> 00:50:45.04
Like I said, there wasn't very many. They were training about, but it takes a little while to get get guys trained up.

775
00:50:45.04 --> 00:50:50.04
So you go on deployment, you show up there and you start working with commandos.

776
00:50:50.04 --> 00:50:55.04
How was your relationship with the commandos, how how good were the commandos as you trained them?

777
00:50:55.04 --> 00:51:07.04
They were, they were much better than, then, you know, non-selected force. I think that's just, you know, as to be expected.

778
00:51:07.04 --> 00:51:17.04
Um, you're still going to have those, you know, variances in your inner troops, but don't even have more comfortable.

779
00:51:17.04 --> 00:51:21.04
So they were fairly capable crew.

780
00:51:21.04 --> 00:51:26.04
They were better.

781
00:51:26.04 --> 00:51:29.04
Shit.

782
00:51:29.04 --> 00:51:30.04
Understood.

783
00:51:30.04 --> 00:51:34.04
And so you're out there working with these guys. What type of type of missions were you doing?

784
00:51:34.04 --> 00:51:37.04
Just basically going after high value targets?

785
00:51:37.04 --> 00:51:42.04
Yeah.

786
00:51:42.04 --> 00:51:45.04
Yeah, we would get until on a high value target.

787
00:51:45.04 --> 00:51:53.04
We'd, you know, trying to, again, going back to trying to train them to do the job for their country.

788
00:51:53.04 --> 00:52:02.04
So we'd work with their, the team later for the team would start working with the, you know, the command level over there.

789
00:52:02.04 --> 00:52:11.04
Okay. This is the objective. How, how do you, how would you take it? And then they would kind of coordinate on a battle plan.

790
00:52:11.04 --> 00:52:21.04
For me, you know, I'd make sure they're Maddox. You know, we're, we're trying to get getting ready. And then, you know, when it came time for an actual mission,

791
00:52:21.04 --> 00:52:27.04
then each one of us would have a squad or, or maybe a few extra.

792
00:52:27.04 --> 00:52:30.04
Which is how big is an Afghan command to squad?

793
00:52:30.04 --> 00:52:39.04
There were, there were belts around the same premise as a, as a, are an army, you know, light of a tree unit.

794
00:52:39.04 --> 00:52:49.04
So you'd have, you know, nine, ten dudes, just depending on what kind of squad you had with you on a given day.

795
00:52:49.04 --> 00:52:54.04
And so then you would be running your squad of Afghan commandos once you're out in the field.

796
00:52:54.04 --> 00:52:59.04
You would, whatever, whatever, just from a, you're no longer just the medic.

797
00:52:59.04 --> 00:53:04.04
You're now a little squad advisor for these Afghan commandos.

798
00:53:04.04 --> 00:53:08.04
Yeah, the, the, the medic piece is always there.

799
00:53:08.04 --> 00:53:14.04
Yeah, yeah, yeah. For, for 18 delta, but, you know, best medicine is superior fire by our.

800
00:53:14.04 --> 00:53:20.04
So if we can, if we can check, if we can go in, we hit him over well and force everybody's good.

801
00:53:20.04 --> 00:53:23.04
We win, we're talking about how tough we are and then we go home.

802
00:53:23.04 --> 00:53:33.04
Yeah. And so yeah, the primary role is to, you know, advise that squad leader on, on how things going.

803
00:53:33.04 --> 00:53:37.04
And then, you know, we also bring all the other assets that the US military comes with, all that.

804
00:53:37.04 --> 00:53:41.04
You know, whether it's helicopter coverage or aircraft coverage.

805
00:53:41.04 --> 00:53:50.04
So we can, we're getting those, you know, that extra intel that we can then push to these guys and be like, hey, this is going on.

806
00:53:50.04 --> 00:53:53.04
This is not going on. Let's fix this.

807
00:53:53.04 --> 00:53:58.04
Yeah, no, from me, I think I just wanted to kind of bring that out because it's, it's pretty cool when you think about it.

808
00:53:58.04 --> 00:54:03.04
You know, you're, you could be this young soldier and you're out there and all of a sudden you're working, you're,

809
00:54:03.04 --> 00:54:08.04
you're an element leader, but you go from just being a medic or just being a demo guy or just being a communicator.

810
00:54:08.04 --> 00:54:18.04
All of a sudden it's okay, you know what, now you're doing that thing, but you're also going to be advising, which, in oftentimes means you're actually leading this squad of commandos and you're making sure that they're making the right move.

811
00:54:18.04 --> 00:54:23.04
So that's a very cool aspect of the job in my opinion, you know.

812
00:54:23.04 --> 00:54:30.04
Yeah, it was, when you could see them getting better, it was definitely a very rewarding and.

813
00:54:30.04 --> 00:54:35.04
As you see them start to take more initiative and start to.

814
00:54:35.04 --> 00:54:47.04
To, you know, be upfront with you like, okay, that's, that's cool to see because I've been working with this guy for a while and I remember one mission we were doing down in.

815
00:54:47.04 --> 00:54:59.04
And can to hard they, we ended up getting infilled and we start looking at our, our GRG, the grid reverence, or the, you know, our little map to see where we are and we're looking at it and it's one AM2.

816
00:54:59.04 --> 00:55:04.04
And whatever it is, I have no idea where we are. We're not on this map.

817
00:55:04.04 --> 00:55:13.04
So, well, we hear some gunfire and like, I'll just go that way, you know.

818
00:55:13.04 --> 00:55:27.04
So, so I have one of the interpreters with with me when I'm blade because they, they all want to, not keep out their real names in these situations, but, you know, I'm played, I'm like,

819
00:55:27.04 --> 00:55:32.04
I'm like, blade, hey, let's get, let's get the truth. Let's hear it moving towards gunfire and see what happens.

820
00:55:32.04 --> 00:55:40.04
And then we start moving or doing our thing. And at one point I look back and blade to right there on my shoulder, he's doing his thing.

821
00:55:40.04 --> 00:55:51.04
And like, like, where is everybody? And they had, hungered down and kind of a couple terrain features back and I got to go get them.

822
00:55:51.04 --> 00:56:02.04
So, but so you start there and then, you know, over time, the gap shortens a little bit to, you know, ideally where they're leading.

823
00:56:02.04 --> 00:56:08.04
Yeah, what was the up tempo like, how often would you guys go and hit targets?

824
00:56:08.04 --> 00:56:25.04
Yeah, it would vary time-time, but with that, that's training and advising piece. We weren't going out like every night because like, we got to take these guys from, from ground up on mission planning and everything.

825
00:56:25.04 --> 00:56:34.04
So we're going out several times a month to, on bigger missions and then other little things as they came up.

826
00:56:34.04 --> 00:56:41.04
And when you, so it starts off, these guys are not wanting to get anywhere. They're not wanting to get shot at.

827
00:56:41.04 --> 00:56:49.04
They're, if there's rounds fired, they're hiding a couple terrain features away. And then you're slowly progressing them, building a relationship with them, getting to know them.

828
00:56:49.04 --> 00:56:55.04
They realize that they can actually do better. And that process is going on and you arrived.

829
00:56:55.04 --> 00:57:00.04
This was in 2007, you guys have arrived in October in 2007, is that right?

830
00:57:00.04 --> 00:57:14.04
Yeah. Okay. And then you're doing one, two, three missions getting these guys trying to push them each time to do a little bit more to take on a little bit more responsibility.

831
00:57:14.04 --> 00:57:17.04
And, and this is just sort of the way it is.

832
00:57:17.04 --> 00:57:23.04
And then what kind of training are you doing? On top of that, you're, when you're back on base, you're running them through immediate action drills,

833
00:57:23.04 --> 00:57:26.04
you're teaching them how to shoot, moving communicate. That's basically what's going on.

834
00:57:26.04 --> 00:57:35.04
Yeah. Teaching those, those basic, you know, infantry skills, take them out to the range, teaching them how to clear a building, teaching them, you know,

835
00:57:35.04 --> 00:57:45.04
just all the things you need to continue to reinforce. And then, like I said, once you got a mission, I go, okay, then we're going to start going through those, those,

836
00:57:45.04 --> 00:57:55.04
tape drills. And we're going to build out a little village here as best we can with our, our budget, which was, you know, tape.

837
00:57:55.04 --> 00:58:04.04
So, we're going to start building that stuff out. So that way, like, okay, we're going to fill here, expect to walk this way, start, you know, going to those choreographs for hersols to get everybody,

838
00:58:04.04 --> 00:58:22.04
get everybody ready. So now as you guys got ready to go into the shock valley, what was, did it seem like just another mission, did it seem like all this one seems like it's going to be a little bit heavier, what was your, what was your assessment of it getting ready to do it.

839
00:58:22.04 --> 00:58:43.04
There were definitely a few red flags that came with this mission, but there's red flags with, with most missions, like, they give us a gun in training for a reason, like they don't ask you to go to a tickle fight with somebody else.

840
00:58:43.04 --> 00:58:54.04
Like we, you're always expecting something, but, but, you know, it was just, it was, you know, we'd gone after high value targets before.

841
00:58:54.04 --> 00:59:12.04
We had in tellies over here, we had in tell them what to expect. So, you know, was, our, the plan that we had going with, nobody was super excited about the idea of infilling the

842
00:59:12.04 --> 00:59:25.04
bottom of a mountain and then walk up that does not sound fun. But it comes to the point where, you know, like, this is the mission.

843
00:59:25.04 --> 00:59:26.04
Yeah.

844
00:59:26.04 --> 00:59:30.04
All right. Cool. We're going to do this mission the best we can and we're going to.

845
00:59:30.04 --> 00:59:33.04
And what, what, how, why did you guys have to insert at the bottom of that hill?

846
00:59:33.04 --> 00:59:43.04
Uh, I think the decision was made that, you know, the Afghan command was still being a little bit new. Like, they knew how to fast-rope.

847
00:59:43.04 --> 00:59:57.04
We had done that stuff, but how many people do we want to risk injuring on that and then just, you know, if there is resistance, you know, what's going to, what's going to come of that.

848
00:59:57.04 --> 01:00:07.04
And I mean, I try to try not to get to caught up in, well, maybe would have better if we'd, we didn't fill the in on top.

849
01:00:07.04 --> 01:00:10.04
Maybe we would have caught on RPG to the 47 right away.

850
01:00:10.04 --> 01:00:17.04
Yeah, no, no, you can't play that game. You can't play that game. I played that game with myself and it's not a good game to play.

851
01:00:17.04 --> 01:00:22.04
Now, it doesn't mean that you don't look at it. You go, oh, yeah. Okay. Here's what we saw. This is why we made the decision.

852
01:00:22.04 --> 01:00:30.04
This is something that you, my brothers that are out there that could be in the same situation. We're going to make that decision. Consider how it worked out for me, right?

853
01:00:30.04 --> 01:00:45.04
And, and, you know, this is, well, a couple weeks ago was 11 year from that battle, but I was actually talking to some SF guys not too long ago and they're like, we still talk about that mission.

854
01:00:45.04 --> 01:00:53.04
We still talk about the, the good, which was the teamwork, the, you know, the everybody coming together, get this, get this job done as best we could.

855
01:00:53.04 --> 01:01:03.04
And we talk about the, the less ideal parts as well and then make sure that we don't learn for somebody else mistakes don't repeat those.

856
01:01:03.04 --> 01:01:09.04
And I think that's a great part about SF is you have that humbleness like, hey, we did not do this right?

857
01:01:09.04 --> 01:01:12.04
Yeah. Please learn. We did this right. Please learn.

858
01:01:12.04 --> 01:01:26.04
And, and, yeah, and, and again, the other side of that is like, you could look at this thing all day and say, well, you should have gone and fast-rope on. And like you said, you take an RPG into one of those helicopters and there's nine dead guys or whatever and you go, okay, well, I guess that wasn't a good plan.

859
01:01:26.04 --> 01:01:33.04
So you can make the best, you can make a horrible decision and it can work out well, you can make the best decision it can work out horribly.

860
01:01:33.04 --> 01:01:42.04
So whether that, that's like, that's the way it is. So what you do is try and learn from it and look at what you did and say, okay, well, well, we have done better.

861
01:01:42.04 --> 01:01:52.04
Could you tell from the the imagery and or the maps of the area what that terrain feature was like?

862
01:01:52.04 --> 01:02:05.04
Because I'll tell you what, I was, you know, I was in get ready for this podcast, I read a bunch about the operation and I kept reading steep terrain and, you know, this that the other thing.

863
01:02:05.04 --> 01:02:10.04
And then, and I kind of calculated in my mind, you know, what that looked like in my mind.

864
01:02:10.04 --> 01:02:14.04
And in my mind, it was, it was pretty bad. It was like, okay, it must have been pretty challenging.

865
01:02:14.04 --> 01:02:22.04
And then I went and looked at actual footage because there's a bunch of actual footage because you guys had a combat photographer and you had a bunch of overhead cover.

866
01:02:22.04 --> 01:02:24.04
I saw that terrain.

867
01:02:24.04 --> 01:02:38.04
Brother, I could not believe it. I was, I was, I was saying, oh my, like as bad as everything sounded, it was 10 times worse when I saw that terrain. I was like, I can't believe that this that these guys did this.

868
01:02:38.04 --> 01:02:48.04
I agree. Yeah, and I don't just mean that for like, if we didn't sort of there, I was saying, well, the fact that you guys went up there, everything that you had to do on that operation because the terrain was so steep.

869
01:02:48.04 --> 01:02:52.04
I couldn't believe that you guys got out of there. I mean, it was just crazy.

870
01:02:52.04 --> 01:03:01.04
Like, you know, I mean, you get used to, you see the predator imagery beforehand to kind of get a feel you've seen satellite imagery.

871
01:03:01.04 --> 01:03:10.04
You get used to saying that stuff and you kind of, you learn to build in that variance of this is what it looks like there, but I know it's not going to be like that.

872
01:03:10.04 --> 01:03:16.04
And so you kind of, you build in your right and your left limit. It's like, this is a kind of what I think I'm going to see.

873
01:03:16.04 --> 01:03:17.04
Yeah.

874
01:03:17.04 --> 01:03:22.04
And it was still a little bit more than, at least for me, what I was expecting.

875
01:03:22.04 --> 01:03:30.04
Yeah, it was no joke. It's, it's a borderline cliff. I mean, it is steep and anyone that's listening to this, you can go on YouTube and you can Google.

876
01:03:30.04 --> 01:03:35.04
You can go through a little battle of shock value and you'll, you'll start to see what I'm talking about.

877
01:03:35.04 --> 01:03:42.04
It's, it's, it's some heavy, steep terrain with a damn fortress on the top of it.

878
01:03:42.04 --> 01:03:49.04
I couldn't believe that either. I was like, oh, that, that is a fortress. How many Afghan commandos did you have with you?

879
01:03:49.04 --> 01:03:57.04
We inserted it right around 100 of them and then some my team, you know, so I go through it in my head.

880
01:03:57.04 --> 01:04:12.04
It's about 12 dudes. When you, when you add it all up, we had about 100 commandos and then we, we had another SF team that was kind of further down on the valley trying to act as a blocking position down there.

881
01:04:12.04 --> 01:04:16.04
And so, but our main assault force,

882
01:04:16.04 --> 01:04:26.04
I mean, it was about 12 dudes that kind of, that main assault. So yeah.

883
01:04:26.04 --> 01:04:31.04
On it. So, so you guys, you, you look at the plan. Everyone's kind of like, hey, it's going to be steep.

884
01:04:31.04 --> 01:04:34.04
It's going to be tough. This is what we do. Let's go get some.

885
01:04:34.04 --> 01:04:41.04
Yeah, we, we made some, like accommodations for that, like,

886
01:04:41.04 --> 01:04:51.04
giving what we're doing today. Obviously, you always want your secondary, but, you know, if, if that barraida doesn't walk up the hill with you today.

887
01:04:51.04 --> 01:04:54.04
I like, we understand. We got to, we got to cut some weight here there.

888
01:04:54.04 --> 01:04:58.04
We got your cells down a little bit. We did, we did, we did, we did pair down.

889
01:04:58.04 --> 01:05:01.04
Body armour. I was still went with with the plates.

890
01:05:01.04 --> 01:05:09.04
Stay with. And when you're doing those precombat checks with your, your, your affin commandos.

891
01:05:09.04 --> 01:05:16.78
was always the fun part is they're super motivated to be there and I remember one

892
01:05:16.78 --> 01:05:21.62
time we're going they want to pre-combat checks with a 240 gunner so we've got a

893
01:05:21.62 --> 01:05:27.30
belt-fed machine gun you carry this this is your job I start going through and

894
01:05:27.30 --> 01:05:31.28
I find you know the first M4 mag on it like all right dude I mean you don't

895
01:05:31.28 --> 01:05:37.24
carry it M4 but I get it and we ended up finding I think 8 or 9 M4 mags on this dude

896
01:05:37.24 --> 01:05:44.38
like carry carry more 7 6 2 for the belt-fed I appreciate the you know you

897
01:05:44.38 --> 01:05:52.12
want to be ready but focus focus in where I need you buddy that's kind of crazy

898
01:05:52.12 --> 01:05:57.60
so so you guys so how many how many helicopters was it that was bringing you all

899
01:05:57.60 --> 01:06:01.76
in there must have been a big package and did you go in all at once like one

900
01:06:01.76 --> 01:06:08.24
giant lift it was yeah one lift it was a couple a couple of shnoaks couple

901
01:06:08.24 --> 01:06:15.16
black ox everybody going in and then I think said there was another team that

902
01:06:15.16 --> 01:06:22.88
kind of infilled down there with a smaller command of package and we had you

903
01:06:22.88 --> 01:06:27.88
know some medical QRF and stuff up in the air and a few other things you

904
01:06:27.88 --> 01:06:35.44
know so we definitely had what seems like enough going in so you land in

905
01:06:35.44 --> 01:06:40.44
there and how long does it take before you realize like well okay this is this

906
01:06:40.44 --> 01:06:49.28
is we we took a big bite well oh oh so I was the first guy get on the

907
01:06:49.28 --> 01:06:55.36
shunook so that that went the last guy to get off you know you know just

908
01:06:55.36 --> 01:06:59.88
having that responsibility make sure everybody gets off get up safely and so

909
01:06:59.88 --> 01:07:07.28
we hit the it's only here the go and everybody's getting off helicopter so

910
01:07:07.28 --> 01:07:11.68
incredibly slowly and I'm at the front so I'm in the back of the line I don't

911
01:07:11.68 --> 01:07:16.32
know what's going on I'm just yelling at commandos like get off of this

912
01:07:16.32 --> 01:07:22.48
helicopter now like the more time we're sitting here the more if if there is a

913
01:07:22.48 --> 01:07:28.08
bad guy watching us we're just giving him more time to watch us so it's just

914
01:07:28.08 --> 01:07:33.88
taking forever and I finally get to the back of the shunook and I look out

915
01:07:33.88 --> 01:07:39.24
and I'm like oh we're like 15 feet off the ground the the valley that we're in

916
01:07:39.24 --> 01:07:44.24
is just so rocky and so such horrible terrain even there like they didn't

917
01:07:44.24 --> 01:07:49.32
land like oh okay this is why in Stegge so long so like everybody else in

918
01:07:49.32 --> 01:07:53.48
front of me I very carefully you know sit down try to shimmy off the backs I'm

919
01:07:53.48 --> 01:07:59.80
not breaking a leg before I even start off to a good start yeah it started

920
01:07:59.80 --> 01:08:07.44
strong so so we we get off the the shunooks fly away and then you just kind

921
01:08:07.44 --> 01:08:17.64
of get that that cold quiet of an Afghan valley you know there's that

922
01:08:17.64 --> 01:08:24.32
little bit of ice in in the water there you know it's just you know you want to

923
01:08:24.32 --> 01:08:32.52
use the cliche like it's too quiet but it's gonna be the house but yeah we just

924
01:08:32.52 --> 01:08:36.92
got we get out there how far did you have to patrol up the valley before you

925
01:08:36.92 --> 01:08:42.60
were you know perpendicular to the target building or the target castle because

926
01:08:42.60 --> 01:08:47.36
that's what it looks like it I mean it you know in hindsight and you know you

927
01:08:47.36 --> 01:08:50.84
see them up there like I mean they had fixed fighting positions right

928
01:08:50.84 --> 01:08:55.68
to go right they were they looked like a castle they were they were set I would

929
01:08:55.68 --> 01:09:07.52
guess 400 meters six hundred and we got basically we didn't fill just basically

930
01:09:07.52 --> 01:09:13.04
trying to use angles just to make sure like we're not that far away so if we

931
01:09:13.04 --> 01:09:20.08
have some element of surprise we don't waste it all but not so close that you

932
01:09:20.08 --> 01:09:26.20
know we're already in it before we get off so yeah it wasn't that far so you

933
01:09:26.20 --> 01:09:30.40
weren't on the ground very long before you started to you start you took fire

934
01:09:30.40 --> 01:09:35.32
from these guys from the castle yeah I couldn't I couldn't tell you how long

935
01:09:35.32 --> 01:09:39.20
before the castle started shooting at us I could have been five ten

936
01:09:39.20 --> 01:09:45.08
fifteen minutes I don't think it was that long so I was in the the trailing

937
01:09:45.08 --> 01:09:51.56
element basically because I was the only US medic on the ground there I had my

938
01:09:51.56 --> 01:09:58.76
afghanic manal medics but I was the only only a team medic there are you

939
01:09:58.76 --> 01:10:02.76
know SF they were supposed to have to of the stop to of that job to the next

940
01:10:02.76 --> 01:10:08.64
unfortunately the the other medic on the team had been hurt on a previous

941
01:10:08.64 --> 01:10:13.16
mission and then while he was recovering from that he was in a vehicle

942
01:10:13.16 --> 01:10:24.84
roll over which didn't help so he got pulled out so yeah I'll still do it so

943
01:10:24.84 --> 01:10:31.52
yeah 10 15 minutes maybe at most I always start walking walking up there you

944
01:10:31.52 --> 01:10:40.52
can see the the lead assault force starting to work their way up and yeah

945
01:10:40.52 --> 01:10:45.32
everywhere it's super steep on both your left and right is you're as you're

946
01:10:45.32 --> 01:10:51.04
kind of looking at it and they find one little area where you have those kind of

947
01:10:51.04 --> 01:10:55.04
terrorists like farm terraces kind of working up and on it's where they'd figured

948
01:10:55.04 --> 01:10:59.84
out okay what we're gonna work our way up there and so you can see them starting

949
01:10:59.84 --> 01:11:05.92
to make progress up the up the mountain and then I distinctly remember I saw

950
01:11:05.92 --> 01:11:15.20
one do just in blue you know blue uh just afghanic art sprinter cross the top of

951
01:11:15.20 --> 01:11:19.60
the hill with a with a rifle and I don't I don't think he's the dude who started

952
01:11:19.60 --> 01:11:24.76
shooting at us but I saw that and then within a few seconds everything just

953
01:11:24.76 --> 01:11:35.24
kind of opened up on us and yeah the day started yeah I want to my little

954
01:11:35.24 --> 01:11:38.84
saying is always take the high ground or it'll take you and this was just a

955
01:11:38.84 --> 01:11:42.68
situation where you guys do you guys do not have the high ground at all you

956
01:11:42.68 --> 01:11:46.84
guys are literally in a valley how long was it before you took your first wounded

957
01:11:46.84 --> 01:11:56.84
it was pretty quick so we start taking the fire I my first job is is to my squad

958
01:11:56.84 --> 01:12:02.84
I think manos squad so I start getting them situated there's not much cover in

959
01:12:02.84 --> 01:12:10.84
there it's just smaller rocks bigger rocks what with that elevation and at various

960
01:12:10.84 --> 01:12:17.08
points I mean both sides were kind of shooting at us so I started getting them

961
01:12:17.08 --> 01:12:22.68
situated and then very quickly I heard the first call for medic one of the afghan

962
01:12:22.68 --> 01:12:29.32
commandos had been shot luckily it was a fairly minor wound so I ran over to him

963
01:12:29.32 --> 01:12:35.56
started treating him and while I was working on him just assessing the situation

964
01:12:35.56 --> 01:12:45.24
that's when I remember watching many RPGs coming down but one RPG in particular

965
01:12:45.24 --> 01:12:51.40
come down hit right in front of our lines that the guys were starting to form down in the

966
01:12:53.40 --> 01:13:02.04
valley and then I hear the calls for Ron coming down and so I know right away like

967
01:13:02.04 --> 01:13:09.24
Ryan Wallen had just been hurt like I just know that right away because before every mission

968
01:13:09.24 --> 01:13:17.16
Ryan would come take his squad of the day and stand in front of me and hold them be like

969
01:13:17.16 --> 01:13:23.40
this is Ron something happens to me find Ron and he get the next one this is Ron something

970
01:13:23.40 --> 01:13:30.04
happens fine Ron good insurance policy and so they you know when the with an

971
01:13:30.04 --> 01:13:39.40
alcohol for medic they're just calling for Ron I okay I know he squad that is so yeah kind of

972
01:13:39.40 --> 01:13:44.76
that quick math like okay this guy he's fine he's he's really not gonna live or die based on anything

973
01:13:44.76 --> 01:13:51.72
I do it's not gonna grab he had a saw like grab your saw start shooting back good luck and

974
01:13:51.72 --> 01:14:02.04
ran over towards more had that next call and like you'd read earlier I find Ryan

975
01:14:02.04 --> 01:14:09.72
I'm a bleeding pretty pretty profusely from neck and of course now you got a neck injury

976
01:14:11.16 --> 01:14:16.36
and you gotta go through those quick calculations like normally how do you stop bleeding lots of pressure

977
01:14:16.36 --> 01:14:25.24
like well I can't choke him to death no turning gets gonna work out yeah so yeah just that's kind

978
01:14:25.24 --> 01:14:31.08
of started the my day of improvising like trying to figure out how to pressure and I don't even remember

979
01:14:31.64 --> 01:14:36.52
exactly what I did he just caught shot no I had several

980
01:14:36.52 --> 01:14:42.84
trap no wounds and that in there but you know you just doing those quick quick assessments

981
01:14:42.84 --> 01:14:48.12
okay there's no bubbling which means that's bright and hit airway you know it's it's bleeding a

982
01:14:48.12 --> 01:14:54.44
lot but not bleeding that fast that I think it caught a karate out or something like that so

983
01:14:55.000 --> 01:15:00.28
it's a pretty lucky neck wound yeah if you have to catch him trapped into the neck he did it pretty well

984
01:15:04.52 --> 01:15:10.04
so yeah as I was working on him everybody is trying to just figure out what's

985
01:15:10.04 --> 01:15:14.52
what was going on the mindset we're still assaulting this thing oh yeah

986
01:15:15.08 --> 01:15:20.92
dang I wait we didn't just trumped me in uh in mental attitude because I would have been oh

987
01:15:20.92 --> 01:15:25.88
we just got launched by the way you used that you said we got launched many RPGs

988
01:15:26.44 --> 01:15:31.80
when I get launched many RPGs it may from an elevated position I'm done assaulting that target

989
01:15:31.80 --> 01:15:36.12
we're going somewhere else hey I got a wound you got I got two wounded people yeah we're not

990
01:15:36.12 --> 01:15:40.20
we're not going any further up this hill and we were spears we're sure Narpej's back at him we had

991
01:15:40.20 --> 01:15:47.64
I I legitimately couldn't not tell you our Afghan commandos real name but he just he knew his name was

992
01:15:47.64 --> 01:15:53.64
Joe Peshie that's that's what we called him yeah he looked like Joe Peshie he was he was our

993
01:15:53.64 --> 01:15:58.20
Afghan Commander RPG guy and so he was kind of like looking at all of us and looking at the

994
01:15:58.20 --> 01:16:03.000
mountain and pointing up there and pointing at his RPG and like hell yeah I do launch them

995
01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:09.96
go get them Joe make it happen and so yeah let's see some good fellows right here yeah so

996
01:16:09.96 --> 01:16:16.92
so I go back she started shooting back so we yes our getting given back as good as they were

997
01:16:19.16 --> 01:16:26.68
but so yeah all that's kind of starting to go on you know warrior when Ryan trying to figure out

998
01:16:26.68 --> 01:16:32.92
what in my you could back and get my squad what what needs to happen and that's when here on the

999
01:16:32.92 --> 01:16:46.20
radio the call from from up on the mountain that multiple guys were now now wounded I'm pretty sure

1000
01:16:46.20 --> 01:16:52.44
the call was it you know the three guys at that point were wounded so yeah basically told Ryan

1001
01:16:52.44 --> 01:17:01.000
you're good have a nice day and grab my stuff just start working towards the mountain

1002
01:17:03.24 --> 01:17:10.44
our team team sergeant Scott Ford and one of the the weapons guys Matt Williams they started

1003
01:17:10.44 --> 01:17:19.72
organizing a response force to get up there and start flexing a little more muscle up on the hill

1004
01:17:19.72 --> 01:17:28.44
so there they're organizing that my focus is hey I need to go so you know hit the mountain start

1005
01:17:28.44 --> 01:17:35.48
working start my way up the same terraced features that I talked about before and you know it is

1006
01:17:35.48 --> 01:17:40.68
climbing hand over you know hand over hand your literally climbing get up to the next terrace

1007
01:17:41.96 --> 01:17:45.64
figure out how much are we being shot out right now whereas it coming from where's the next place I can

1008
01:17:45.64 --> 01:17:53.24
go up and just start working our way up as we went up you know the the other support LMA kind of got

1009
01:17:53.24 --> 01:18:02.84
got with me and we all just started taking that terrain together took a while to get there I don't

1010
01:18:03.64 --> 01:18:08.04
I don't know the they put out their estimates what I don't how long it took me to get there

1011
01:18:08.04 --> 01:18:17.96
got up to the the little outcropping that had become you know where the where the command

1012
01:18:17.96 --> 01:18:28.92
element was what was and sort of processing the situation that we had what as I right as I'm

1013
01:18:28.92 --> 01:18:37.96
looking at it I can see one of our turpenters C.K. he appears to be K.A.A. to the

1014
01:18:37.96 --> 01:18:48.12
to the team guys were it or down with the different wounds and so I started just trying to go

1015
01:18:48.12 --> 01:18:55.80
through the fastest you know triage that I can to figure out what I need to do and and

1016
01:18:55.80 --> 01:19:00.52
honestly even at this point where I don't think the calls made quite yet that were

1017
01:19:00.52 --> 01:19:10.36
done for the day but it was going to be called very soon after that so yeah trying to

1018
01:19:11.80 --> 01:19:19.08
remember the the full sequence it was a busy day so I think I started working on Dylan first just

1019
01:19:19.08 --> 01:19:26.84
because he looked the worst off he had a gunshot wound to his right arm and then another one to his

1020
01:19:26.84 --> 01:19:36.76
hip pelvis area of his his arm wound I joke of him now because he's he's fine and it's okay

1021
01:19:36.76 --> 01:19:44.12
to joke about getting shot after the fact but you know joke with him that one ball the hit his arm

1022
01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:52.52
it was it was just a lucky bullet for him but it went through his his

1023
01:19:52.52 --> 01:20:01.32
his uh for you know speaking words is tough sometimes his uh his rifle strap it went okay

1024
01:20:01.32 --> 01:20:08.84
swing it went through his sling cut cut that then went through his arm and then he he chose to

1025
01:20:08.84 --> 01:20:13.08
keep his pistol on that day but the time we were still kind of running a pistol on the front of

1026
01:20:13.08 --> 01:20:21.24
your body armor and so it had actually lodged in between his plate and his pistol it hit the

1027
01:20:21.24 --> 01:20:30.20
inside of his his pistol and that just slightly different angles on that bullet and yeah so

1028
01:20:30.84 --> 01:20:36.68
his arm wound was basically just a very minor blade didn't worry too much about that

1029
01:20:39.16 --> 01:20:43.000
but didn't take me along to figure out his his his other one was going to

1030
01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:55.000
give me a literally a pan the ass for him all day figure it out of the way for me but it was you

1031
01:20:55.000 --> 01:21:01.88
know you can just see the way it's bleeding and it's just you know those very small wounds

1032
01:21:01.88 --> 01:21:13.32
entry so I had made the I would say dumb call for just a few moments I don't even know how long

1033
01:21:13.32 --> 01:21:22.28
it was I didn't want to roll him anymore than I had to to to see what was going on so I

1034
01:21:22.28 --> 01:21:27.24
for a little bit took my helmet off set it to the side so I could just roll him just to see

1035
01:21:27.24 --> 01:21:35.72
the the downside wound how bad was it didn't end up being that bad so I'm going to roll them back

1036
01:21:35.72 --> 01:21:43.08
over hopefully I put my helmet on right away or I think maybe somebody yelled at me but so just

1037
01:21:43.08 --> 01:21:48.44
started working on trying to figure out how to get pressure on there you'd mentioned we had the

1038
01:21:48.44 --> 01:21:57.88
comet camera man out there with us by that point his camera had already been shot so he he just

1039
01:21:57.88 --> 01:22:07.24
became an extra set of hands for me to to help so okay let me go triage the rest of these guys are

1040
01:22:07.24 --> 01:22:14.12
quick just hold pressure here for me I'll be back in a second and you know I say I'll be back

1041
01:22:14.12 --> 01:22:25.32
like the area we're working in was not that bad gives maybe 20 meters across and it's just that

1042
01:22:26.20 --> 01:22:32.44
that slight slope you get on a hillside before it falls off the cliff so I just big like and

1043
01:22:32.44 --> 01:22:39.24
everybody's just hanging on that tiny little bit of the slope trying to not fall off and not get

1044
01:22:39.24 --> 01:22:44.92
job and the the guys had been shot when they on that slope when they got shot are they pushing up a little bit

1045
01:22:44.92 --> 01:22:50.52
were you were you somewhat safe in that shot were you in that spot were you somewhat protect

1046
01:22:50.52 --> 01:22:55.08
your was the guys still getting I guess they weren't because you still guys were getting shot no guys were still

1047
01:22:55.08 --> 01:23:03.88
still getting shot so we're basically you're just trying to use that tiny bit of an angle to minimize

1048
01:23:03.88 --> 01:23:11.16
how much you can be shot at there was there was no place where you were safe on there at all

1049
01:23:13.88 --> 01:23:22.36
if you kind of picture like from from from that little outcropping where we were if you're looking at the

1050
01:23:22.36 --> 01:23:30.20
main village it was almost like like a like a hockey stick kind of in front of you as the way the

1051
01:23:30.20 --> 01:23:36.68
mountain kind of wrapped around so yeah that long wall kind of on what I'm considering my left but

1052
01:23:36.68 --> 01:23:43.72
then it still wrapped around so the whole village if you got a little bit of cover from this side

1053
01:23:43.72 --> 01:23:47.48
you're exposed to the others yet the other side still had you and then there were some people on the

1054
01:23:47.48 --> 01:23:53.40
other side of the the valley who were shooting us too but it was much it was insignificant compared to

1055
01:23:53.40 --> 01:23:59.72
other problems we had was your mindset at this point totally focused on just getting to get working on

1056
01:23:59.72 --> 01:24:05.64
the guys did you go into that mode like okay this is what I got to do or was any part of you going

1057
01:24:06.84 --> 01:24:11.56
this is not good did it was any part of you that was saying hold on a second look what's happening

1058
01:24:11.56 --> 01:24:15.80
situation we're surrounded they have the enemy has the upper ground I got one through one of the

1059
01:24:15.80 --> 01:24:22.44
guys what calls being made what was what was like your tactical assessment of what was happening

1060
01:24:22.44 --> 01:24:30.76
or were you just straight up working on guys trying to save their lives for my perspective it was

1061
01:24:30.76 --> 01:24:39.08
straight up working on guys at that point trying to get my commandos and you know leading them anywhere

1062
01:24:39.08 --> 01:24:47.64
that was over for me I would I would find them hours and hours later and they were like they were

1063
01:24:47.64 --> 01:24:52.60
still down in the valley just hanging out trying to use a little bit of cover and they all kind of saw

1064
01:24:52.60 --> 01:24:56.84
me in there I like we thought you were dead oh well I go like you're welcome back

1065
01:24:58.68 --> 01:25:03.88
and you're like thanks for the support thanks yeah thanks so like I said we were working on

1066
01:25:03.88 --> 01:25:12.12
clothes in those gaps with them but sometimes the other bands still broke but so yeah I was mostly

1067
01:25:12.12 --> 01:25:23.24
focused on just trying to treat these guys and you know you need to convey information to the

1068
01:25:23.24 --> 01:25:29.64
team leader and you need to tell the guy you're you're fine buddy you don't don't worry about that so

1069
01:25:29.64 --> 01:25:35.56
at one point you know telling Dylan you're good dude we walked us off and then kind of looking

1070
01:25:35.56 --> 01:25:43.64
over the team leader me and like no seriously he needs to go now he needed to go a while ago but

1071
01:25:43.64 --> 01:25:52.52
now we'll be fine too so and I didn't really think about his perspective on it but you know later

1072
01:25:52.52 --> 01:26:00.76
he's like yeah I was hearing it all too like sorry about that that's that's a rough way to hear things

1073
01:26:00.76 --> 01:26:08.84
so so you had three guys wounded in that position as well so there was the the three kind of a knit

1074
01:26:08.84 --> 01:26:15.80
the two of two Americans initially credit critical and the one at the end and I so I

1075
01:26:15.80 --> 01:26:21.48
started working on Dylan went over to the wese saw what what had happened him loose my last

1076
01:26:23.32 --> 01:26:27.96
and he had been shot through the thigh and through the ankle and both on the right side

1077
01:26:27.96 --> 01:26:35.56
and luckily it didn't hit any of the major vessels but it like for this it's thigh it just

1078
01:26:35.56 --> 01:26:40.44
ripped it in half like you could look all the way through his thigh look like you could have been

1079
01:26:41.08 --> 01:26:47.56
a fish and you were gutting it so while he wasn't you know he didn't hit a major artery it's just

1080
01:26:47.56 --> 01:26:52.68
so much tissue damage that this could still form compartments syndrome we could still kill him

1081
01:26:52.68 --> 01:27:00.52
many different ways so I started working you know assess him and you know just doing those first

1082
01:27:00.52 --> 01:27:04.36
sweeps like I'm not trying to do anything definitive yet it's just like I figured out what

1083
01:27:04.36 --> 01:27:10.84
all's going on and then I'll come back through so after seeing a little wese I still felt like

1084
01:27:10.84 --> 01:27:21.88
I owed CK an actual check this is the interpreter the interpreter he was he was that but I still owed him

1085
01:27:22.52 --> 01:27:30.68
like it less less I know what killed him maybe he's still alive so I went up to the check on him

1086
01:27:30.68 --> 01:27:36.12
he he'd he'd been shot just behind the left ear and yeah it was it was an unsurbable wound

1087
01:27:36.12 --> 01:27:46.76
yeah so I checked on checked on him and then you know we just unfortunately with it's a little

1088
01:27:46.76 --> 01:27:54.60
cover as we had for anything like he couldn't take up space where we had cover so we we just kind of

1089
01:27:54.60 --> 01:28:04.12
had him off to the side a little bit but exposed to the elements because you know unfortunately the

1090
01:28:04.12 --> 01:28:12.20
living guys didn't have enough space so after checking on him I kind of go back through and

1091
01:28:13.32 --> 01:28:17.000
obviously this entire time we're still getting shot at you can still feel those spults gone by

1092
01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:28.04
you can still feel the dirt kicking up you know there's just everything so tight in there

1093
01:28:28.04 --> 01:28:34.52
and so little space like I'm trying to kneel over these guys to do the best I can't for them and

1094
01:28:35.24 --> 01:28:40.60
and as things are just falling on us trying to cover them as things you know just rocks are

1095
01:28:40.60 --> 01:28:44.36
coming down as close as they're happening just trying to get yeah because at some point they start calling

1096
01:28:44.36 --> 01:28:53.40
in for fire is that is that happening yet the the the the the calls for fire came in they started

1097
01:28:53.40 --> 01:28:58.84
pretty quickly um second runner was our Air Force come back controller that day he got the Air Force

1098
01:28:58.84 --> 01:29:09.48
Cross very deservedly so you know all of us are alive because of all the stuff that he called in the

1099
01:29:09.48 --> 01:29:17.24
day yeah he's dropping bombs danger close dropping 2000 pounder I mean it's dropping the stuff and

1100
01:29:18.44 --> 01:29:22.84
again you know why I'm talking about this as if I know who's what it looks like because I saw

1101
01:29:22.84 --> 01:29:28.04
you can watch these videos and you can see the bombs hitting in massive hitting that castle and

1102
01:29:28.04 --> 01:29:33.16
massive bombs hitting that castle and even even the bombs hit that castle they they do damage but

1103
01:29:33.16 --> 01:29:41.000
that castle was massive and crazy you know we ended up through the course of the day one of our

1104
01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:48.84
Afghans broke his leg the the wood framing on a building they got blown up broke his leg so we

1105
01:29:48.84 --> 01:29:54.92
gotta deal with that you're getting just all the other wounds that are coming with those because

1106
01:29:54.92 --> 01:30:02.36
this is massive debris is coming down on you guys from those danger close hits bomb drops and

1107
01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:08.60
like debris is coming down on you guys because you guys are below it down a cliff right at

1108
01:30:08.60 --> 01:30:13.24
at one point I don't remember exactly where in the sequence of events

1109
01:30:13.24 --> 01:30:20.68
basically I could say we kind of had that wall on our left that went straight up and there was

1110
01:30:21.32 --> 01:30:27.40
there was a a building there and they were getting in that and starting to shoot down at us

1111
01:30:28.28 --> 01:30:36.28
and so that had to go away so Zach ended up calling in a strike hit that and

1112
01:30:36.28 --> 01:30:43.72
I don't go hunting too much for footage online but I don't have seen it through the military side

1113
01:30:43.72 --> 01:30:48.92
you can you can actually hear the pilot come on the radio after he drops that one he's like

1114
01:30:48.92 --> 01:30:52.60
I do not feel good about that one yep that's how danger close it was it was so danger close

1115
01:30:52.60 --> 01:30:57.16
that the pilot comes on the radio afterwards and says he goes that was real close I don't feel good

1116
01:30:57.16 --> 01:31:01.64
about that one meany you can hear the the the sickness and his voice thinking how you know

1117
01:31:01.64 --> 01:31:06.12
do we just kill our own eyes just kill everyone of course for us you know we're covered in

1118
01:31:06.12 --> 01:31:12.28
we're getting covered in debris we're getting just rained on stuff but we're like thank you

1119
01:31:14.60 --> 01:31:19.96
totally insane so at what point did you guys decide okay we got to get out of here

1120
01:31:21.96 --> 01:31:26.04
or were you still thinking that people just doing this assault up there at that point we were

1121
01:31:26.04 --> 01:31:31.40
pretty much we're pretty much done at that point so scofford is he in sergeant he comes in like I

1122
01:31:31.40 --> 01:31:37.48
said he he was you know right there with us moving up the hill bringing on those those extra guys

1123
01:31:37.48 --> 01:31:44.68
and he started I'm working I'm trying to keep these guys alive he starts working that let's get them

1124
01:31:44.68 --> 01:31:54.12
out of here piece so our lead element it actually made the edge of the village like I think they got

1125
01:31:54.12 --> 01:32:01.08
into at least one building so they're starting to help we got that foothold like we we made it guys

1126
01:32:01.08 --> 01:32:10.44
we won but so he makes that call okay we got to we got to pull those guys back to start getting

1127
01:32:10.44 --> 01:32:16.28
which is actually incredible to even have gotten to that and to be honest with you if things

1128
01:32:16.28 --> 01:32:19.88
now that you know I'm talking about how much I would have just you know bailed out of there

1129
01:32:19.88 --> 01:32:25.64
once you get a foothold in that situation now it's you know it's gonna be CQC us against them like

1130
01:32:25.64 --> 01:32:30.12
you you actually have a pretty good chance you know well you got a hundred commandos or we get them

1131
01:32:30.12 --> 01:32:34.12
up that hill you get a foothold in that building it's like okay or in that in that castle we

1132
01:32:34.12 --> 01:32:39.40
can start taking it out so that's that's impressive man props to you guys for sure yeah the

1133
01:32:39.88 --> 01:32:48.04
fortunately as bad as it started for quite a while through the day it actually kept getting worse

1134
01:32:48.04 --> 01:32:55.56
like I could never stop I think we started to get some laws after we'd done so many

1135
01:32:55.56 --> 01:33:03.96
air strikes but so the the side of the mountain that I went up a little bit later in the day

1136
01:33:03.96 --> 01:33:10.92
like it was just no man's land you didn't go over there if you wanted to not be dead so

1137
01:33:10.92 --> 01:33:17.48
the logistics of trying to get an actual fighting force up even though we had a foothold

1138
01:33:18.12 --> 01:33:26.04
it just became an untenable position so you know I'm working on these guys I'm I'm trying to

1139
01:33:27.64 --> 01:33:31.72
get some kind of hammer control bleeding control on on Dylan

1140
01:33:31.72 --> 01:33:41.40
and you know with Louisa I didn't quick uh quick treatments on him got his wound bandage up as

1141
01:33:41.40 --> 01:33:49.16
well as I could so that way just with all that trauma he didn't end up you know still still dying

1142
01:33:49.16 --> 01:33:57.48
on the on the mountain just from from some something so I'm working on Dylan and

1143
01:33:57.48 --> 01:34:05.16
and I said it based on what he was describing to me like I didn't see the point of like

1144
01:34:05.88 --> 01:34:10.12
in the medical rest they teach you like oh you can you know press on a pelvis down and then

1145
01:34:10.12 --> 01:34:14.44
he squeeze it and that's how you'll see if it's broken or not like I didn't see the point

1146
01:34:14.44 --> 01:34:22.28
and doing that to him just where the wound was like something in there's broke he's not going

1147
01:34:22.28 --> 01:34:29.56
to benefit from me jumping up and down on it to find out again dude your your pelvis is broke sorry

1148
01:34:29.56 --> 01:34:37.40
about that so but he was also describing like oh my foot doesn't feel like it's straight like

1149
01:34:37.40 --> 01:34:42.76
like nothing feels like it's lining up right and it wasn't because the we'd find out later

1150
01:34:42.76 --> 01:34:49.000
the bullet had gone through is from the moral head so shatter that did a bunch of damage to

1151
01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:57.56
the pelvis itself so I'm just seeing this and I was looking at what I what I can physically see

1152
01:34:57.56 --> 01:35:05.72
I don't think it hit an artery but if it hit the pelvis and it's been a while since I was

1153
01:35:05.72 --> 01:35:10.60
a medic but you know I remember having those those numbers in my head like okay I'll

1154
01:35:10.60 --> 01:35:16.76
pelvic fracture is gonna cause this much bleeding and a femoral fractures gonna cause this much

1155
01:35:16.76 --> 01:35:22.12
bleeding and trying to process those things like okay he's not he's not bleeding out but he's still

1156
01:35:22.12 --> 01:35:30.36
gonna bleed out on me so it was so high up you couldn't put a turn again on it couldn't really

1157
01:35:31.24 --> 01:35:37.88
doing things so it just came up with I'd you know that I had cell locks he must

1158
01:35:37.88 --> 01:35:46.44
sat a cage and it would just not need to stop bleeding I had a powder of that so I did as I just kind

1159
01:35:46.44 --> 01:35:52.44
of started pouring that on the wound and then taking my fingers and shoving it into the wound because

1160
01:35:52.44 --> 01:35:59.96
the wound was so small and three wounds are yeah not big so just started shoving that in there

1161
01:35:59.96 --> 01:36:05.96
trying to get as much in as I could just repeating that process over and over until I felt like

1162
01:36:05.96 --> 01:36:13.72
my head enough I don't know just it was just kind of gut call shoving fingers in your body

1163
01:36:13.72 --> 01:36:20.28
to be like hopefully this will help and wrapped him up as well as I could and so while I'm

1164
01:36:20.84 --> 01:36:29.48
doing this that's when the lead element started to get back towards us and they were gonna help

1165
01:36:29.48 --> 01:36:38.44
us start to get these guys out of there and within moments minutes whatever it was of them getting

1166
01:36:39.16 --> 01:36:44.68
getting there that's when we took our next American cashity John Walding

1167
01:36:46.60 --> 01:36:53.08
been hit mother right rightly just below the knee basically stampitated is like right away

1168
01:36:53.08 --> 01:37:01.64
I was hanging on by a little bit but it just stampitated it so the hemostatic agents that are out there

1169
01:37:01.64 --> 01:37:06.44
they've gotten better now but at the time it was you have to hold pressure for five minutes

1170
01:37:07.72 --> 01:37:11.96
otherwise maybe the clot will break and then now he's gonna bleed inside there and you'll never see it

1171
01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:21.08
so start yelling at somebody get a turn to get on him they do and now he's just stacked up

1172
01:37:21.08 --> 01:37:31.56
you know taking a more more real estate for us so our team started and it's got he's

1173
01:37:32.28 --> 01:37:41.40
trying to figure out okay now we have another casually so we we had it another negative and

1174
01:37:41.40 --> 01:37:47.40
we lost a positive because now it's that's a due to can't help move and so you know at that point

1175
01:37:47.40 --> 01:37:52.92
he's very I know at this point it's very clear we're done with the mountain we just need to go home

1176
01:37:55.48 --> 01:38:01.40
so you know we're still still we're gonna then I know I was working on on Dylan

1177
01:38:02.60 --> 01:38:09.72
and Scott ends up getting shot for the first time in the chest plate

1178
01:38:09.72 --> 01:38:18.36
and so we're on over to him at this point check him you know hesitate to say he's fine

1179
01:38:18.36 --> 01:38:24.52
but he's fine the chest plate did a good job he's he's obviously gonna feel that for a few days

1180
01:38:26.28 --> 01:38:32.12
so I go back keep trying to package up these guys a little bit more and we're just

1181
01:38:32.12 --> 01:38:42.04
you know it's it's tough not to gloss over like minor wounds like you know this guy just got

1182
01:38:42.04 --> 01:38:48.44
more sharp no ones like quick check you're fine move on one of our commandos at some point

1183
01:38:48.44 --> 01:38:55.40
in all of this another one of our commandos got shot in the head and he dropped instantly and

1184
01:38:55.40 --> 01:39:04.44
like well that dude's 100% dead but later we pull him back over and like he's actually still alive

1185
01:39:04.44 --> 01:39:10.76
he was he just decided to take a little nap out there on the edge of the on the amount of

1186
01:39:10.76 --> 01:39:19.56
but it you know it there's weird things bullets do it it dented his head but it didn't

1187
01:39:19.56 --> 01:39:28.52
I didn't kill him so we're just continue just to accumulate these problems and so working

1188
01:39:29.32 --> 01:39:37.08
Scott ends up turning around to say something to us and that's when he got shot again this time

1189
01:39:37.08 --> 01:39:43.40
in the left arm and almost the ampidates his left arm but not nothing compared to

1190
01:39:43.40 --> 01:39:54.84
the visual image that Johnson had and I think it was the same bullet was it a bullet right after

1191
01:39:54.84 --> 01:40:00.60
on a burst I can't say for sure but it was at the same time that he got shot in the left arm

1192
01:40:00.60 --> 01:40:08.84
I got hit in the head and so I had my helmet back on at this point so I got hit in the head and so

1193
01:40:08.84 --> 01:40:16.60
working on doing it and I'm trying to ask him like am I all right like I don't know

1194
01:40:18.52 --> 01:40:23.16
but you know trying to do like butts waves are trying to figure out if there's so much blood

1195
01:40:23.96 --> 01:40:29.24
I can't even tell everywhere I don't know if I'm bleeding so I'm asking you know I'm asking

1196
01:40:29.24 --> 01:40:35.56
him working on like how am I okay can I can I can I keep going

1197
01:40:35.56 --> 01:40:45.64
but he's like yeah you're you're fine I don't I don't remember exactly what he said but

1198
01:40:47.08 --> 01:40:52.60
convey yeah you're fine so I grabbed your hand. It was the flesh wound. Yeah look I mean

1199
01:40:52.60 --> 01:40:57.48
the helmet the helmet did its job so it wasn't it wasn't didn't do anything to me

1200
01:40:57.48 --> 01:41:03.24
it felt like I hit for the baseball bat and I just how I described it feels like what you would think

1201
01:41:03.24 --> 01:41:11.40
that they would so I grabbed a turn to get right out to Scott put a turn to get on his his left arm

1202
01:41:13.48 --> 01:41:25.24
there's just like a roll there's no where to put people luckily he's of of the serious injuries

1203
01:41:25.24 --> 01:41:33.48
we were he money he's the only ambulatory guy so basically he's self evacuates down the same side of

1204
01:41:33.48 --> 01:41:38.36
the mountain that we'd come up and you know where the fire was continuing to get worse but there was

1205
01:41:39.08 --> 01:41:43.96
there was some guys set Howard and Matt Williams they're doing good work over there and so

1206
01:41:44.84 --> 01:41:53.08
basically he kind of got down there and they see him with his arm and they're like we'll get you

1207
01:41:53.08 --> 01:41:59.56
to take care so they worked him down down the mountain on that one side but that really only

1208
01:42:01.24 --> 01:42:09.40
only work for him because he could do it could move everybody else is is not that mobile

1209
01:42:11.64 --> 01:42:21.16
so Dave Sanders is kind of coming through and you know he's he's trying to figure out a

1210
01:42:21.16 --> 01:42:29.000
route for us and so in in my mind like what I just consider behind me now there's basically

1211
01:42:30.60 --> 01:42:35.56
the cliff kind of just goes straight down but like any cliff there's there's a little

1212
01:42:36.36 --> 01:42:42.92
terrace over here there's a little terrace over there so he he's exploring that route and he comes back

1213
01:42:42.92 --> 01:42:48.36
up and it just comes to the simple like he's like this will work and we're like he's everybody

1214
01:42:48.36 --> 01:42:54.92
and he's guys doing it and he's like they probably won't die well that's better than the

1215
01:42:54.92 --> 01:43:03.40
route right now that's that's a good plan so yeah I got this one section I of one other article I

1216
01:43:03.40 --> 01:43:10.04
pulled out this is it it's somewhere around here and again it's it's like but I just this left a really

1217
01:43:10.04 --> 01:43:17.08
good picture in my mind of what was going on and kind of the how critical the situation is Walton

1218
01:43:17.08 --> 01:43:23.96
Captain Walton was the uh was the element commander he's there and he this is this is talking

1219
01:43:23.96 --> 01:43:29.32
about him and he's got some um quotes in here but this is from the stars and stripes which is like a

1220
01:43:29.32 --> 01:43:36.52
military newspaper overseas and it says Walton feared his force was on the verge of being overrun

1221
01:43:37.48 --> 01:43:42.20
with the insurgents nearing his position Walton reached for grenade and called an

1222
01:43:42.20 --> 01:43:49.56
massive danger close strike expecting it could take out his entire team they were all prepared

1223
01:43:49.56 --> 01:43:57.16
to make the ultimate sacrifice he said the bomb dropped and then he saw an image he would remember

1224
01:43:58.44 --> 01:44:05.40
forever from that fight sure's body draped over the injured man he'd been working on through the

1225
01:44:05.40 --> 01:44:11.32
fight in that moment the strike that we had called in on our own position detonated just above

1226
01:44:11.32 --> 01:44:19.000
us and blocked out the sun as the dust settled ronshire was the first thing that I saw on top of his

1227
01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:25.40
wounded teammates protecting them even to the end when we had all fully accepted that we were

1228
01:44:26.12 --> 01:44:32.28
going to go down fighting ronshire was still thinking of others

1229
01:44:32.28 --> 01:44:44.28
yeah I mean like he says in there it definitely it definitely got to the point where like okay

1230
01:44:45.80 --> 01:44:54.36
this is this is the day uh I don't know how everybody kind of just processed that

1231
01:44:54.36 --> 01:45:04.28
um I know for me there was a point where I just set a quick prayer just asking God help

1232
01:45:05.08 --> 01:45:11.72
my wife Miranda and our our son who at the time was a couple of days shy of three months old

1233
01:45:11.72 --> 01:45:22.12
uh just make sure they're cool with with what's about to happen and then just go back to work and just

1234
01:45:24.68 --> 01:45:32.36
you know taking it in little chunks it's it's too big to try and think of a week of

1235
01:45:32.36 --> 01:45:43.16
over the course the day man the four US critical three other US wounded 2k AA about

1236
01:45:45.40 --> 01:45:54.76
13, 14, 15 afghan commandos interpreters wounded so you know in just terms of those numbers that's

1237
01:45:55.56 --> 01:46:00.92
too much to deal with but if I just you know this is the worst thing and going on right now I'm

1238
01:46:00.92 --> 01:46:05.80
going to deal with this and then come up for air look around that's now the worst thing so I'm

1239
01:46:05.80 --> 01:46:10.92
going to over there and I'm going to deal with that and so you know just keep taking it on little chunks

1240
01:46:10.92 --> 01:46:15.32
keep working working through it and then at some point you started working towards okay we got to

1241
01:46:15.32 --> 01:46:21.72
get these guys down we're going to start a low one these guys down so uh Dave Sanders figured out okay

1242
01:46:21.72 --> 01:46:33.16
this is this is the least bad option so I just started getting everybody ready to go kind of

1243
01:46:33.16 --> 01:46:42.04
started with okay of these guys who are up here the waste has a really bad injury but

1244
01:46:43.40 --> 01:46:51.08
he's stable enough I gave him a fentanyl allipop so he's not feeling too bad like you're going first

1245
01:46:51.08 --> 01:46:59.32
so we got him I just do a double check on on the guy and then go over to the edge of the

1246
01:46:59.32 --> 01:47:06.92
cliff it's our work item down is and depending on how bad they're there when we're like

1247
01:47:06.92 --> 01:47:16.52
the waste could help himself a lot so I was getting ready get him over to the edge and uh Dave and

1248
01:47:16.52 --> 01:47:23.40
uh why am I free in our combat camera guys name my quarter they kind of take them the rest of the way

1249
01:47:24.36 --> 01:47:28.68
down the hill and then I'd go back up to our little position all right next

1250
01:47:29.72 --> 01:47:36.12
serious one was Dylan okay getting him ready yet I got an IV started on I've got a few different

1251
01:47:36.12 --> 01:47:42.28
things going I got everything as ready as they could send him over all that stuff was ripped out

1252
01:47:42.28 --> 01:47:49.40
and just mangled by the time we got into the bottom but well it is what it is that's that's now

1253
01:47:49.40 --> 01:48:02.44
over to the width later um so then it came time to I got over to uh John Walding

1254
01:48:02.44 --> 01:48:13.000
uh started doing an assessment on him just through the variances of battle and and everything his

1255
01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:20.76
his turn get had been placed properly it um which is vessel sometimes will relax or tension or

1256
01:48:20.76 --> 01:48:28.84
tense up just so he was at that point he's actually building quite refusely um so we had to

1257
01:48:28.84 --> 01:48:38.36
make some adjustments on his turn to get him restabilized just had him hold his leg just give him

1258
01:48:38.36 --> 01:48:47.16
something to do and you know we let lower him down the hill and as we're kind of finishing that up

1259
01:48:47.16 --> 01:48:53.000
like all of the amulatory commando and interpreter cash please they're kind of working their way down

1260
01:48:53.000 --> 01:49:02.60
through all this as well set Howard and Matt Williams are kind of mentioned earlier like they came

1261
01:49:02.60 --> 01:49:10.36
through right behind us just kicking off everybody else that had not got the message it was time to go

1262
01:49:10.36 --> 01:49:16.92
or like CK who would you know been killed they got they got they got him off for us the the

1263
01:49:16.92 --> 01:49:26.04
I can commando you know just I don't really have a great plan for we got him off and we just

1264
01:49:26.04 --> 01:49:31.64
got everybody down started setting up an of a casually collection point down there at the bottom of the hill

1265
01:49:32.20 --> 01:49:41.16
uh you know hallway you're climbing down stuff still exploding you still get in shot at

1266
01:49:41.16 --> 01:49:51.88
uh but by the time we got down to the the valley again it was with a little bit more cover it was

1267
01:49:53.24 --> 01:49:58.52
you know everything that day was just this sucks less than that so I'm gonna I'm gonna do

1268
01:49:59.08 --> 01:50:07.32
I'm gonna do this uh so at that point you know we've got everybody off it got to go through

1269
01:50:07.32 --> 01:50:16.12
recheck everybody now because we've now moved moved all the patients um long since

1270
01:50:18.04 --> 01:50:26.44
out of most of my supplies so then it comes down to well you do need a bad edge but he needs it more

1271
01:50:26.44 --> 01:50:31.96
but you're you're gonna be fine without one uh and just kind of keep making those calls

1272
01:50:31.96 --> 01:50:41.72
how long did it take for CASA back to show up uh so we'd never really got like a

1273
01:50:43.08 --> 01:50:49.24
dedicated CASA back to come in that day we had some black hawks that were supporting the mission

1274
01:50:49.24 --> 01:50:57.88
up there and those pilots were awesome they were like there's wounded we're gonna come in it's

1275
01:50:57.88 --> 01:51:03.96
it's hot they're fine with it they know what's going on so they came in when we got

1276
01:51:05.72 --> 01:51:10.52
uh the first group loaded up and out and then they came in again got the next

1277
01:51:11.56 --> 01:51:17.56
group so basically we got all the critical and all been on ambulatory people out of there

1278
01:51:18.44 --> 01:51:24.92
and then everybody else just you you just gotta walk out of here there's no other now it's

1279
01:51:24.92 --> 01:51:33.16
gonna come for ya uh it was at some point around this time when I'm down down in the valley

1280
01:51:34.04 --> 01:51:42.60
working um it's that point that can notice my arm is starting to hurt a little bit and

1281
01:51:44.52 --> 01:51:51.48
they just look at my arm arms there it's fine whatever just you know if you bang or elbow on

1282
01:51:51.48 --> 01:51:58.20
something you just kind of shake it out and you move on with your day it was later that night

1283
01:51:59.72 --> 01:52:05.88
you know get back to the base after we went and saw the wounded guys going to take a shower

1284
01:52:05.88 --> 01:52:12.12
I noticed I would cut on my arm and bruising around my elbow and I was like well that wasn't there

1285
01:52:12.12 --> 01:52:23.72
earlier uh went and found my uniform and it's got that bullhole in it and I was like oh I don't

1286
01:52:23.72 --> 01:52:28.68
have any idea at some point you took around when when that went through

1287
01:52:32.04 --> 01:52:38.60
bad I was just it's one of those days like it's bad as it was you know you knew

1288
01:52:38.60 --> 01:52:48.44
just an inch this way I think we'd done the math before and it was like we came up with like eight

1289
01:52:48.44 --> 01:52:53.96
inches or something I if the enemy just could move a bullet eight inches over the course of the

1290
01:52:53.96 --> 01:53:01.64
day like move this bullet one inch this way move this bullet this way whatever they you know what

1291
01:53:01.64 --> 01:53:08.68
of just killed everybody like when like guys got shot through the his camel back you know it

1292
01:53:09.72 --> 01:53:13.96
first that it hit like he had a flare in the back there it had done that but that you just

1293
01:53:13.96 --> 01:53:21.32
inch that Dylan who had the bullet skimmed between his armor and his his gear he moved that

1294
01:53:23.80 --> 01:53:31.24
but that's how combat is it how it millimeters inches you train you you get his good

1295
01:53:31.24 --> 01:53:37.96
imperfection as you can and then hope for a little bit of a little bit of luck as well

1296
01:53:39.40 --> 01:53:44.52
you you guys and you I know you lost two well you lost your one interpreter killed

1297
01:53:45.32 --> 01:53:53.000
well C.K. and then one afghan soldier killed yeah but none of the Americans were were killed

1298
01:53:53.000 --> 01:54:00.28
no none of the Americans that's like completely you know and that's a miracle it's incredible yeah

1299
01:54:00.28 --> 01:54:11.96
Bob Barardine he was the afghan first sergeant he was on that SF team those when the blocking

1300
01:54:12.52 --> 01:54:18.84
done valley at some point they came up to kind of help us do that final policing up of everything

1301
01:54:18.84 --> 01:54:24.28
and he was he was he was he was a great first sergeant for them he was leading from the front

1302
01:54:24.28 --> 01:54:30.20
like you should and he caught around just below that chest plate it is a year or two as we

1303
01:54:30.20 --> 01:54:41.48
can't have a dozen much matter but he dropped and that was it so as rough as the day was and as much

1304
01:54:41.48 --> 01:54:46.04
as you kind of go through after the fact like what could I have done better wouldn't could have

1305
01:54:46.04 --> 01:54:55.32
you know been here a little faster than that shot that guy a little bit quicker the only two

1306
01:54:57.08 --> 01:55:05.000
okay there was just there was nothing to be done for us so eventually got comfortable with it all

1307
01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:10.84
because of that and then what when your team what did they even do with your team now you guys come

1308
01:55:10.84 --> 01:55:15.24
back you got all these casualties that they stand you guys down they send you home what they do with you

1309
01:55:17.88 --> 01:55:26.68
no we so after we got everybody all the the one you guys out eventually we kind of regroup

1310
01:55:26.68 --> 01:55:32.68
we go down back back to the infel point get them the helicopters leave wind in a planning it's some

1311
01:55:33.88 --> 01:55:39.40
fire base I don't even know where it was we don't know if we're going back there's another SF team

1312
01:55:39.40 --> 01:55:44.68
there we still got a lot of commandos so we're like back in the game are we gonna go

1313
01:55:46.52 --> 01:55:53.80
I linked up with the the the medical support that was there refit my bag got got everything ready to

1314
01:55:53.80 --> 01:56:03.08
go again like we were gonna go right back but we didn't which was probably the right call for that day

1315
01:56:03.08 --> 01:56:08.92
so then we ended up going back to Jolalabad which is where we were operating at at the time

1316
01:56:12.68 --> 01:56:16.52
a couple of the one guys were there so we went and saw them a couple of the one guys were already a

1317
01:56:16.52 --> 01:56:25.80
boggerman we took care of them we got a senior you know let's see guy Carl

1318
01:56:25.80 --> 01:56:34.20
became a new acting team sergeant we just went about better day and we still we still did another mission

1319
01:56:35.40 --> 01:56:37.40
a few weeks later

1320
01:56:39.24 --> 01:56:45.96
it's just I don't remember so one of the one of the guys a damn plant season out sergeant major

1321
01:56:48.12 --> 01:56:53.40
out there that was his first mission with us and of course

1322
01:56:53.40 --> 01:57:00.12
he was like are they all like this and of course they are like some of them are worse

1323
01:57:03.16 --> 01:57:05.72
welcome aboard stay everybody gets some

1324
01:57:06.36 --> 01:57:10.92
dang and then how much longer was that deployment you guys did a few more operations

1325
01:57:10.92 --> 01:57:13.80
is with your new team sergeant you guys when how did you feel going back out

1326
01:57:13.80 --> 01:57:24.04
obviously that that fight was was different anything we'd faced before

1327
01:57:25.56 --> 01:57:31.48
we had that when when we left whatever it was six weeks later that was that was my last

1328
01:57:32.84 --> 01:57:36.76
combat deployment so I didn't face anything like that again but it when we went back out I mean

1329
01:57:36.76 --> 01:57:45.72
we were ready to go again and I remember on that next mission we went out on

1330
01:57:48.84 --> 01:57:56.12
we're going through the village and our our interpreters are just you know they would talk

1331
01:57:56.12 --> 01:57:59.40
with the bad guys on walkie talkies sometimes they just talk

1332
01:58:00.52 --> 01:58:05.88
talk shit back and forth through each other and so at one point they were like oh these were the guys

1333
01:58:05.88 --> 01:58:10.84
we just I think these are the guys we just messed up a few weeks ago like let's get out and

1334
01:58:11.24 --> 01:58:17.40
then a cowboy came in and did a run and took out a few and they were like second thought let's

1335
01:58:18.44 --> 01:58:28.60
let's call today you know a drawn nose that was the end of that day but so yeah it would be

1336
01:58:28.60 --> 01:58:39.56
it was definitely a day we'll never forget but I'm just glad that you know the team

1337
01:58:40.52 --> 01:58:46.44
came together they got the job done we didn't accomplish the mission we didn't find the bad guy

1338
01:58:46.44 --> 01:58:55.56
we didn't get to bring him back but you know someday's the win is is just we got

1339
01:58:55.56 --> 01:59:04.60
everybody that we could out of their alive and you know we certainly gave them worse than we got

1340
01:59:04.60 --> 01:59:13.32
yeah that's estimated enemy killed was like 150 to 200 and and that that that ended up being

1341
01:59:13.32 --> 01:59:19.64
the most decorations highest decorations handed out for a single day battle since they'd be

1342
01:59:19.64 --> 01:59:27.96
at none more it was for this for this operation that you guys went on and then so when you came home

1343
01:59:28.60 --> 01:59:32.28
what made you decide because you ended up getting out of your army what made you decide you were

1344
01:59:32.28 --> 01:59:39.80
going to get out and I'm getting out of May of 2009 so just over a year later it was

1345
01:59:39.80 --> 01:59:52.36
a lot of different factors like said at my older son was actually born in January of 2008 so

1346
01:59:52.36 --> 01:59:58.44
I came home song born and then right back to Afghanistan and then you know we had other missions in

1347
01:59:58.44 --> 02:00:12.12
this mission afterwards so that you know that priority factor starts to go in there another part

1348
02:00:12.12 --> 02:00:20.92
of it was just I think I always felt like there was something I was supposed to do

1349
02:00:20.92 --> 02:00:31.08
and that seemed like it's good a good thing to check a block with this as I could I could

1350
02:00:31.08 --> 02:00:37.80
think of it's so many different like factors coming at like I there's not a day that goes

1351
02:00:37.80 --> 02:00:44.68
by that I don't still miss the team so wish whenever I hear their out there like I wish I was

1352
02:00:44.68 --> 02:00:51.80
there with them I wish I was you know still doing it but you know I felt like I'd done

1353
02:00:53.16 --> 02:01:01.24
whatever it was I was supposed to do and you know I think I get stuff for any special operations

1354
02:01:01.24 --> 02:01:06.36
guys see all Greenberry Ranger whatever at some point you have to hang it up because

1355
02:01:07.32 --> 02:01:11.88
time is going to yeah it's a young man you're gonna hang it up with you want to or not at some point

1356
02:01:11.88 --> 02:01:21.24
that's it's that game so I felt like you know I'll go out and got my own terms and speak

1357
02:01:21.24 --> 02:01:25.80
yeah and then how did you end up getting into this secret service like what what made you

1358
02:01:25.80 --> 02:01:33.64
look at that and think that seemed like a good call so I think I started applying for them

1359
02:01:33.64 --> 02:01:41.40
what I had about six months ago in the military what Pete during trust on them so

1360
02:01:42.84 --> 02:01:47.40
full disclosure with them I federal law enforcement just seemed like a good

1361
02:01:48.12 --> 02:01:53.96
next transition so I shot them blast out you know the FBI the secret service the DEA

1362
02:01:54.84 --> 02:02:03.32
marshals air marshals everybody and very quickly on I really just liked the personality

1363
02:02:03.32 --> 02:02:11.08
like came with the secret service the the attitude that the people had the dedication of the

1364
02:02:11.08 --> 02:02:20.92
job the focus in a lot of ways you know like like like SF like you have super important mission

1365
02:02:22.12 --> 02:02:25.80
sometimes you have all the resources you need sometimes you don't you're still gonna figure it out

1366
02:02:25.80 --> 02:02:31.56
you're still gonna you're still gonna make it work I really liked that personality that came with it

1367
02:02:31.56 --> 02:02:40.12
so while everybody showed interest in me I kind of focused there and I'm getting hired

1368
02:02:40.68 --> 02:02:45.80
with them a couple months after I got got out of the army and then well what's that on boarding

1369
02:02:45.80 --> 02:02:50.44
like you go through like a boot camp scenario with them because they must take kids out of college right

1370
02:02:51.24 --> 02:02:56.76
you're supposed to have like I remember what the book answer is like three years of real

1371
02:02:56.76 --> 02:03:05.40
world experience after college so from my class you had a mixture some people had military

1372
02:03:05.40 --> 02:03:11.88
backgrounds some people had law enforcement backgrounds some had one was a lawyer just any

1373
02:03:11.88 --> 02:03:16.12
different background so is it like a gentleman's course boot camp scenario

1374
02:03:16.12 --> 02:03:28.76
or for the most part you know coming from from the SF background like I don't know who we need to

1375
02:03:28.76 --> 02:03:34.68
kick out you got to kick out somebody right just to make sure that everybody else who's here knows

1376
02:03:34.68 --> 02:03:40.44
like you know it could happen to you but we had a good class everybody everybody got through

1377
02:03:40.44 --> 02:03:49.80
and but it was I'll say it was about three months of training in Georgia the federal law enforcement

1378
02:03:49.80 --> 02:03:58.20
training center kind of basic information on the criminal investigator training programs and

1379
02:03:58.20 --> 02:04:03.48
basically legal law stuff how to handle evidence all that kind of stuff yeah the basics every

1380
02:04:04.20 --> 02:04:09.48
law enforcement person needs and then you continue on with four more months at the secret service where

1381
02:04:09.48 --> 02:04:16.68
you learn the the two aspects of of our agency both the financial crimes investigations and the

1382
02:04:16.68 --> 02:04:21.72
protection aspects and most people don't know about the financial crimes investigation of the

1383
02:04:21.72 --> 02:04:26.52
secret service they don't think it's about that arm of it well and that's I mean that's why it was created

1384
02:04:26.52 --> 02:04:35.56
a you know president Lincoln signed the secret service into into existence to fight counterfeit

1385
02:04:35.56 --> 02:04:41.16
and because at the end of the Civil War I can remember this statistic like two thirds of

1386
02:04:41.16 --> 02:04:48.76
the currency in the country was counterfeit and you can't rebuild when half of everything is fake

1387
02:04:50.04 --> 02:04:56.28
so you know you signed that and it was soon after that you know you went to a play

1388
02:04:57.48 --> 02:05:04.04
didn't work out for them but then it was 40 years later that we kind of took over the full time

1389
02:05:04.04 --> 02:05:12.20
protection of the president and of course that's our our main mission now well while the majority

1390
02:05:12.20 --> 02:05:21.16
of people in the agency are out there keeping the financial system secured intact obviously the

1391
02:05:21.16 --> 02:05:28.52
number one mission is the president of the vice president's other heads of state or heads of

1392
02:05:28.52 --> 02:05:36.28
government that come in to the country we protect them then you know obviously there are all no

1393
02:05:36.28 --> 02:05:44.04
fail missions like you can all let's something happen to the president or if you have some country

1394
02:05:44.04 --> 02:05:52.20
come in that maybe nobody's you know nobody's ever heard of this dude well we still can't let

1395
02:05:52.20 --> 02:05:59.08
random street violence happen to the sky or or something so you just there's a bad whole spectrum

1396
02:05:59.08 --> 02:06:03.08
that you have to work around so you get done with the training and then where did you where was

1397
02:06:03.08 --> 02:06:07.08
you where did you get stationed did you go to the president's detail or did you go to the crime

1398
02:06:07.08 --> 02:06:13.72
fighting part so the the typical career path is is you go out to one of the field offices around the

1399
02:06:13.72 --> 02:06:20.84
country and and fight crime for a little while so when I got got the offer they offered me a

1400
02:06:20.84 --> 02:06:28.44
couple different cities to start in the Phoenix Arizona sound like the best option so I took that

1401
02:06:31.48 --> 02:06:38.44
yeah my wife and son moved out there right away we bought a house you know while I

1402
02:06:38.44 --> 02:06:44.44
take me to live there I was off a training for several months and then I joined them as soon as I finished up

1403
02:06:44.44 --> 02:06:53.32
and I spent basically the next four years in Phoenix from May 2010 to May 2014

1404
02:06:56.84 --> 02:07:04.36
doing whatever financial crime or so financial crime includes what you have you know you credit card fraud

1405
02:07:04.36 --> 02:07:09.48
you're counterfitting I need to get your number because credit card fraud people are all about

1406
02:07:09.48 --> 02:07:16.12
you know coming after me it's like open access and that's what and when I talk to people

1407
02:07:16.12 --> 02:07:20.52
like yeah that happens it's happening to everyone that's like the main crime right now when I say hey

1408
02:07:20.52 --> 02:07:24.36
there's credit card fraud amy says y'all they happen to me two weeks ago it's happening to everyone now

1409
02:07:24.36 --> 02:07:30.76
yeah it's happening to me yeah happens dang okay maybe I won't call you

1410
02:07:30.76 --> 02:07:37.96
yeah it's it's one of those things I mean there's so many different levels to it like you can

1411
02:07:37.96 --> 02:07:45.000
you know there's the the prudence that you know you'll see the things like oh check a ATM

1412
02:07:45.64 --> 02:07:50.84
see if you see a skimmer at hatch to it which is great advice it's definitely something you know

1413
02:07:50.84 --> 02:07:58.52
something looks weird on a temp so use it but you go to a store and I mean even like target

1414
02:07:58.52 --> 02:08:02.44
that you're these bigger stores oh yeah that's right they had the massive you get hacked

1415
02:08:02.44 --> 02:08:08.92
you didn't do anything wrong like you use the machine machine was security with the

1416
02:08:08.92 --> 02:08:14.92
output at some back level so there's those two aspects of the crime that we're in a chasing

1417
02:08:14.92 --> 02:08:20.20
out because the person who stole all the the card information but they're almost never the

1418
02:08:20.20 --> 02:08:27.000
person who's using it they sell it somebody else so you you've got to pick which side do I want

1419
02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:32.60
a chase today I don't want to figure out who stole it it don't figure out who's using it and it

1420
02:08:32.60 --> 02:08:39.32
kept you pretty busy and then eventually you get called back to DC is that where you got station next

1421
02:08:39.96 --> 02:08:46.12
so I'm station in DC now with the counter salt team for the secret service it's

1422
02:08:47.48 --> 02:08:53.08
which is like the cool like the coolest job right I mean in the secret service let's be straight up right

1423
02:08:53.08 --> 02:08:57.64
there's nothing cool that they say now I'm on the counter assault team of the secret service it does sound

1424
02:08:57.64 --> 02:09:02.28
cool yes and what really means is sitting in the back of the vehicle somewhere for long periods

1425
02:09:02.28 --> 02:09:06.44
of time you know motorcade or something yeah with the full body I'm around everything so you're

1426
02:09:06.44 --> 02:09:11.80
uncomfortable you're miserable complaining about it like why did I sign up for this but

1427
02:09:11.80 --> 02:09:18.52
and there's like 8,000 pieces of security that someone would have to get overcome for you guys

1428
02:09:18.52 --> 02:09:25.32
to get the call but some day it doesn't go so we got that going for us but what I would

1429
02:09:25.32 --> 02:09:30.36
love about that just like with SF is you know to be there you have to you have to volunteer you

1430
02:09:30.36 --> 02:09:33.96
have to go through selection process you have to go through another school we washed out

1431
02:09:34.76 --> 02:09:38.68
between selection and the school itself we washed out about half maybe a little more

1432
02:09:38.68 --> 02:09:45.08
how tight are they you are they on shooting in that school stands are much higher than the general

1433
02:09:45.08 --> 02:09:51.40
secret service could you might be taking shots around the president you want to throw that round

1434
02:09:52.12 --> 02:09:58.68
you know what no pressure yeah that's a little extra level to that you know law enforcement

1435
02:09:58.68 --> 02:10:04.36
every round counts aspects yeah absolutely military you know most of the most of the

1436
02:10:04.36 --> 02:10:11.000
most most of the council you can't just fire indiscriminately but you know if he's generally in that

1437
02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:17.64
area that's why I get in the warm on bullet yeah secret service yeah I got I got in trouble one

1438
02:10:17.64 --> 02:10:23.000
time during CQC training for putting down cover fire in a building I was like you know some

1439
02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:26.36
was trying to cross all the way and I'm like okay I know there's a bag at other mrs our shooting

1440
02:10:26.36 --> 02:10:32.84
at him and you know the instructor is like choco what what were you doing over here and I was like

1441
02:10:32.84 --> 02:10:36.28
where he's like in this you know you're holding this hallway then you just started shooting and I was

1442
02:10:36.28 --> 02:10:40.84
like I was putting down cover fire for the guy that was moving you guys he's like I did it but you're

1443
02:10:40.84 --> 02:10:45.96
really not supposed to do that in CQC and I'm like okay fair enough you know but if the guy

1444
02:10:45.96 --> 02:10:50.20
comes on you look hard and he wasn't coming around the corner when I was cracking round that

1445
02:10:50.20 --> 02:10:56.92
of exactly so you so you you're just that's you going is there a rotation that you're going on

1446
02:10:56.92 --> 02:11:01.48
for that are you like all in all the time pretty three months on three months off do you just are you just

1447
02:11:01.48 --> 02:11:10.36
in a certain area and that's when you're live so they break us down into we we call them we have

1448
02:11:10.36 --> 02:11:16.36
teams and then two teams make up a company and then and then so we have basically four different

1449
02:11:16.36 --> 02:11:22.44
elements so ones on training ones on your days ones on your eating ones on your your meds

1450
02:11:22.44 --> 02:11:27.88
at all time and so yeah your your downtime is to train and then the rest of the time

1451
02:11:27.88 --> 02:11:35.48
you're up protecting right in the man or you know present vice president other people as

1452
02:11:35.48 --> 02:11:46.92
as need support always working and at some point during during that job you you got you

1453
02:11:46.92 --> 02:11:50.20
you went to hospital and figured out something that wasn't going too well

1454
02:11:50.20 --> 02:11:58.84
I'd say to the least so you know if you kind of go through the the full story

1455
02:12:01.16 --> 02:12:08.76
what was that late spring early summer of 2016 I kind of started getting a little pain in my

1456
02:12:08.76 --> 02:12:17.16
my right hip a little pain in my back but of course I have some pain I was running around a kit

1457
02:12:17.16 --> 02:12:23.80
for the army for six and a half years you know at that point I've been doing it with the

1458
02:12:23.80 --> 02:12:31.40
count of salt team for two and a half years just you know you're not supposed to do that to your

1459
02:12:31.40 --> 02:12:38.04
body it's not it's not good for you everybody knows it so it was actually in California

1460
02:12:38.04 --> 02:12:46.52
hiking with the Obama family and you know somebody doing a father say we can trip with them and

1461
02:12:47.64 --> 02:12:54.28
you know my hip was hurting my back kind of seized up and like I was just this is not right but

1462
02:12:54.92 --> 02:13:01.96
I go see my dog he's like just stretch some more like or stop doing your your job like well

1463
02:13:01.96 --> 02:13:09.24
I'm not gonna stop so I'm gonna stretch some more pain all kind of kept getting a little worse

1464
02:13:09.24 --> 02:13:17.80
little you know just a little more annoying as as I went since the docking to me

1465
02:13:17.80 --> 02:13:23.24
good answer let me try a chiropractor got some relief for a little while from that and it

1466
02:13:23.24 --> 02:13:33.000
but I just kept getting getting a little bit worse and so he came up with the the differential

1467
02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:37.96
diagnosis to use a medical terms that he was like you probably tore some cartilage in your

1468
02:13:37.96 --> 02:13:43.40
hip at some point and I was like I don't remember doing that and he was like well as active as you are

1469
02:13:43.40 --> 02:13:52.92
he can just happen sometimes so we do an MRI in February of 2017 and then then next day

1470
02:13:52.92 --> 02:13:58.44
waiting on results I still flat to actually fly out to San Diego to do to do some more work

1471
02:13:59.48 --> 02:14:05.24
and that afternoon after I got here he called and he was you know telling us well

1472
02:14:08.52 --> 02:14:14.28
you have a few different use of word lesions you know once I tell you where is what he's like

1473
02:14:14.28 --> 02:14:19.32
you got a few things going on your hip that I know normal I need you to go talk to

1474
02:14:19.32 --> 02:14:29.000
this dock like as soon as you can he didn't even tell me like what the what that dock

1475
02:14:29.72 --> 02:14:33.72
did but like okay he's at this hospital he's this dock I googled him like anybody

1476
02:14:33.72 --> 02:14:39.96
wondering like oh he's an oncologist like so this like of course that call is bad but

1477
02:14:41.08 --> 02:14:47.08
you know now we're getting more information okay this is really not good I took the red eye back home

1478
02:14:47.08 --> 02:14:53.80
and next day get a CAT scan and that's when they find about tumors just everywhere

1479
02:14:56.52 --> 02:15:01.40
what they decided was the primary tumors about the size of a little bigger than a baseball on my left

1480
02:15:01.40 --> 02:15:10.28
long um and by that point like I started thinking like with all the work that I would do

1481
02:15:10.28 --> 02:15:14.60
like I'm just getting out of shape like my run times keep getting a little worse but

1482
02:15:14.60 --> 02:15:23.000
at no point did I think that's what it was so we find out like through that MRI like I'd actually

1483
02:15:23.000 --> 02:15:31.56
I had a fracture on my pelvis just had a baseball on my lung and a fracture on my pelvis

1484
02:15:33.56 --> 02:15:40.44
still working so yeah we go through the process of trying to

1485
02:15:40.44 --> 02:15:45.96
to figure out what's going on find a dock don't really care for him fire him

1486
02:15:46.92 --> 02:15:51.08
go find another dock at Johns Hopkins we really like we're still working with him

1487
02:15:54.28 --> 02:16:04.12
yeah we've been fighting just over two years now and then on top of that your your

1488
02:16:04.12 --> 02:16:14.84
well as I mentioned you guys your ODA team got something like 12 or 13 silver stars amongst them

1489
02:16:14.84 --> 02:16:21.16
it was 10 silver stars three or four bronze though the Air Force Cross for the Air Force Cross

1490
02:16:22.28 --> 02:16:29.32
and you were one of those you were one of those silver stars and they the the government or yeah

1491
02:16:29.32 --> 02:16:37.08
the military basically I forget what year is maybe 2015 or 16 they started doing a

1492
02:16:38.68 --> 02:16:48.20
service-wide review of all of the awards that had been handed out or awarded to see if they all

1493
02:16:49.88 --> 02:16:55.72
all kind of matched up and were where they should be and I know actually a

1494
02:16:55.72 --> 02:17:04.84
three of my guys who had been written up for bronze stars they got they got advanced or they

1495
02:17:04.84 --> 02:17:14.20
got raised to silver stars but they they reviewed year award as well and they came to a

1496
02:17:14.20 --> 02:17:18.84
well conclusion that it should be upgraded and how did you find out about that so

1497
02:17:18.84 --> 02:17:25.64
I of course had heard about the review process that the Secretary defense had ordered

1498
02:17:27.08 --> 02:17:33.000
never gave it a second thought just what's going about my day-to-day life

1499
02:17:34.76 --> 02:17:43.08
I mean honestly I think like most soft guys like just to add a boy and here's your next mission

1500
02:17:43.08 --> 02:17:53.72
that's all any of them expect or want or everything so in August of last year I get the first

1501
02:17:54.28 --> 02:18:01.16
call on on my home phone because you know you still have a one it's part of that triple play package

1502
02:18:01.16 --> 02:18:04.20
you know they get you with the home phone like I don't want a home phone they're like

1503
02:18:04.20 --> 02:18:13.000
because more do not have it like the landline yeah yeah so somebody somebody calls they left

1504
02:18:13.000 --> 02:18:20.20
of they left a voice mail on that is even called a voice mail when it's on the answering machine

1505
02:18:20.20 --> 02:18:26.04
answering I don't know but they they they called and left a message and they claimed that they were

1506
02:18:26.04 --> 02:18:35.24
from the Pentagon and they they said we needed to talk to Ron Cher this is it almost sounds legit

1507
02:18:35.24 --> 02:18:42.12
but it's definitely a scam I'll call him back and just speaking of credit card for here we go

1508
02:18:43.32 --> 02:18:47.96
so I call him up and they're like we need to set up a call between you and a hiring and the

1509
02:18:47.96 --> 02:18:54.44
Odeo official and so I'm like who now like we can't tell you I'm like why we can't tell you

1510
02:18:55.48 --> 02:19:03.48
I'm like well that doesn't sound right so go to send me an email from your

1511
02:19:03.48 --> 02:19:13.48
official dot mill to my secret service email launch it over there will just just

1512
02:19:13.48 --> 02:19:17.32
verify who you are because you say you're from there or me you're at the Pentagon or you're

1513
02:19:17.32 --> 02:19:23.48
doing I get calls from them all the time you know yeah I arrest is always calling me saying

1514
02:19:23.48 --> 02:19:34.36
I'm about to be arrested so they sent me the message confirming who they were and so I

1515
02:19:35.000 --> 02:19:40.52
just not gonna tell me why and they're like no well that's cool I got a family vacation I'm taking

1516
02:19:40.52 --> 02:19:53.88
next week I have this person call me after that but I had mentioned where we're in this

1517
02:19:53.88 --> 02:20:00.28
trip I started getting some new pain so we do some scans we find out I got a little bit

1518
02:20:00.28 --> 02:20:03.96
a little bit of stuff going on and we make a plan to deal with that as soon as we get back from

1519
02:20:03.96 --> 02:20:14.84
our trip so I go on my family vacation we come back and we start creation basically the next day

1520
02:20:14.84 --> 02:20:23.88
just trying to get control again so this person the army they start calling me again like hey we're

1521
02:20:23.88 --> 02:20:30.44
going to set up a day for this person to talk to you and so they're like okay cool do you have any

1522
02:20:30.44 --> 02:20:39.88
idea right now or are you just no my wife and I were trying to like brainstorm like I

1523
02:20:39.88 --> 02:20:46.52
knew about the review process did that even click in your head I think at one point so

1524
02:20:48.36 --> 02:20:58.20
with the email like the the not subject but like your name and then this is my job as an important

1525
02:20:58.20 --> 02:21:09.24
I am I see that and I see what it is so I go go that because I don't know who this person is

1526
02:21:09.24 --> 02:21:13.64
or when it's best to get her so I start going down that chain and at one point we actually

1527
02:21:14.44 --> 02:21:22.28
found out that they're in the long process of the metal on our they're one of the many tears

1528
02:21:22.28 --> 02:21:28.36
but well if I kind of look at each other you know just kind of chuckle it off like that's ridiculous

1529
02:21:31.48 --> 02:21:37.56
but so we're like well maybe maybe you know you're going to witness for some mud

1530
02:21:37.56 --> 02:21:44.36
I get a witness for something I'd signed up for the you know the burn pit registry that's out there

1531
02:21:44.36 --> 02:21:53.16
like sign up for that I'll maybe had something do with any of these numerous things so the

1532
02:21:53.96 --> 02:22:00.84
day I'm supposed to get the call them tell her working that day because my just finished

1533
02:22:00.84 --> 02:22:10.44
ups and downs feel awful and so I get the first call from the military saying are you

1534
02:22:10.44 --> 02:22:19.48
going to take your call later today like yes I'm good then one of my friends ends up calling

1535
02:22:20.04 --> 02:22:28.28
Miranda and says basically standby for Ron's boss and so he gets on the line to talk to Miranda

1536
02:22:28.28 --> 02:22:34.52
and he's like Ron good for a phone call today and she's like yes Ron's fine for a call is this

1537
02:22:34.52 --> 02:22:40.28
the call that we've been talking to other people about and he's like yeah and why are you

1538
02:22:40.28 --> 02:22:48.36
calling we just can't process like why is he now calling us so he's like are you good for your call

1539
02:22:48.36 --> 02:22:52.68
like yeah we're good for our call the army calls me back again you good for your call like yes I'm

1540
02:22:53.56 --> 02:22:58.76
still good for my call I'm gonna run out of battery though if you keep calling me the check

1541
02:22:58.76 --> 02:23:05.80
if my good for my my call or not so a little while later I boss calls back again and he's like

1542
02:23:05.80 --> 02:23:15.48
your call is canceled like why are you cancel my call and you know just trying to run through

1543
02:23:15.48 --> 02:23:21.000
all the scenarios you're had like what why are you doing anything with this and he's like trust

1544
02:23:21.000 --> 02:23:32.12
me it's good and it was like I don't trust you but but okay I have no choice in this matter so

1545
02:23:32.12 --> 02:23:39.40
he ends up calling and he's saying next Tuesday I need you to come into the White House with

1546
02:23:39.40 --> 02:23:44.84
Miranda and you need to talk to the boss of the president's detail

1547
02:23:46.84 --> 02:23:51.96
that makes even less sense than anything that's been happening so far

1548
02:23:51.96 --> 02:24:02.92
so Tuesday it's September 4th we end up he comes by our house gets us brings us in

1549
02:24:03.72 --> 02:24:11.16
into the White House complex and we go over and we start in the boss of the president's

1550
02:24:12.04 --> 02:24:17.08
detail we start off in his office and so he meets us in there he's like you know how I run

1551
02:24:17.08 --> 02:24:25.16
Miranda thanks for coming in we really appreciate it John Kelly wants to talk to you guys

1552
02:24:26.76 --> 02:24:30.68
so of course Miranda and I are kind of looking at each other like trying to do like

1553
02:24:31.72 --> 02:24:39.32
Hansi knows like in kind of what where we we landed is like okay I think I'm gonna get upgraded to

1554
02:24:39.32 --> 02:24:47.48
a cross which is an amazing honor I think and I think the Secret Service found out and since

1555
02:24:47.48 --> 02:24:53.80
John Kelly the Chief of Staff at the time you know former general we have that connection

1556
02:24:54.92 --> 02:25:01.56
like he's gonna he's gonna bring me in to tell me so we we spend some time in that

1557
02:25:01.56 --> 02:25:06.20
that boss's office and he bring us into the waiting room and in the west wing itself

1558
02:25:06.20 --> 02:25:14.92
and so we're sitting there just continuing to wait and then John Kelly comes by he's like

1559
02:25:14.92 --> 02:25:19.08
hey Ron I'm Miranda thanks so much for coming in I just want to talk with you guys for a little bit

1560
02:25:20.92 --> 02:25:29.56
and so he's like follow me back to my office so we start following him down

1561
02:25:29.56 --> 02:25:37.16
Miranda doesn't know the White House so she's just tagging along like we're walking down

1562
02:25:37.64 --> 02:25:40.04
the hallway and I think we pass

1563
02:25:43.08 --> 02:25:49.40
Sarah Huckabes office and she's like oh look she's just you know getting kind of star struck by the

1564
02:25:49.40 --> 02:25:56.52
by the office and all all the things but in my mind I'm like you know I don't want to interrupt

1565
02:25:56.52 --> 02:26:04.20
the Chief of Staff to the President but I'm like sir your office is that way like do you know

1566
02:26:04.20 --> 02:26:13.56
where you work but I'm just long for the ride so walk down the hall we make a couple turns and then

1567
02:26:14.36 --> 02:26:20.52
he makes that left into what I know is the old and so I get I get to that threshold I see the

1568
02:26:20.52 --> 02:26:26.68
President sitting at his desk and as soon as I hit that threshold I can see there's cameras

1569
02:26:27.32 --> 02:26:32.04
so the video and you're still cameras just going crazy just White House internal stuff

1570
02:26:32.76 --> 02:26:40.68
just clicking away at that point it was definitely like oh shit oh Mr. Nako

1571
02:26:41.88 --> 02:26:48.84
today got out of hand so the President gets up he shakes her hand you know he did not expect to see

1572
02:26:48.84 --> 02:26:58.84
me today did you know wasn't wasn't playing on it I honestly can't remember everything you know just

1573
02:26:58.84 --> 02:27:06.52
the usual platitudes thanks for your service I heard you right off the stand like yeah and is like

1574
02:27:06.52 --> 02:27:13.48
did you know you're getting looked at for Afghanistan you know is like well just want you to know

1575
02:27:13.48 --> 02:27:20.12
I just approved you get the congressional Medal of Honor and honestly that point it all just kind

1576
02:27:20.12 --> 02:27:27.32
of went to White Noise I couldn't I don't know what else he said afterwards we have the pictures

1577
02:27:28.04 --> 02:27:32.36
and you can you can flip there and you can see the moment where he tells because I have a

1578
02:27:32.92 --> 02:27:40.20
definite what the are you saying and my wife is starting kind of that happy happy cry

1579
02:27:40.20 --> 02:27:50.92
but yeah so we had had no idea that I was getting I mean I knew generally at things

1580
02:27:50.92 --> 02:27:55.08
were getting looked up but I'm no idea that my packet would stand out and not stand out or

1581
02:27:56.20 --> 02:28:03.32
or anything yeah we got out of there the the the boss that had

1582
02:28:03.32 --> 02:28:12.36
basically found out it was you know government efficiencies like that day I was supposed to

1583
02:28:12.36 --> 02:28:17.40
say the call they kind of went down the hall like does this kind of work for you like I've been emailing

1584
02:28:17.40 --> 02:28:23.48
you from a secret service email address for weeks now but so it was at that moment they were like

1585
02:28:23.48 --> 02:28:29.000
did he work for you and they're like yeah he works for us and he's here in DC and he he has a White

1586
02:28:29.000 --> 02:28:36.92
House pass he can walk in a little White House and it's only once so so they coordinated that they

1587
02:28:37.80 --> 02:28:45.000
made sure the counters all team for that day they were all you know Marine Green Brake

1588
02:28:45.56 --> 02:28:51.32
some were army and a numberina just all army guys who all kind of got it and then they found out

1589
02:28:51.32 --> 02:29:00.84
like as I was finding out and so went and saw them and you know the whole whole thing was just

1590
02:29:00.84 --> 02:29:13.24
super surreal trying to figure out why me why why not why any of it I remember who's soon after that the

1591
02:29:13.24 --> 02:29:21.48
the the curl from the Pentagon she called she's like so you've obviously not talked to him you know

1592
02:29:21.48 --> 02:29:27.72
you know why we're being secretive now like yeah and then she said a lot of stuff about like

1593
02:29:29.40 --> 02:29:35.08
you know how the process is gonna work and and other things and at the end of it it got to the

1594
02:29:35.08 --> 02:29:42.60
point I was like man I don't remember thing you just said but I don't have a uniform and like I don't

1595
02:29:42.60 --> 02:29:49.000
know why that out for 78 nine years or something like age thousand nine is when I got out so this is

1596
02:29:50.20 --> 02:29:56.60
me that's nine and a half years yeah next month will be ten so it was nine and a half years since I got out

1597
02:29:59.16 --> 02:30:04.36
so yeah it was the last thing that I thought was was coming and me I'm obviously

1598
02:30:04.36 --> 02:30:14.12
super humble by but it was definitely the last thing I thought would come my way I still remember feeling

1599
02:30:15.80 --> 02:30:23.000
almost guilty calling my teammates it's a lot them know so like hey can you come to DC on a

1600
02:30:23.000 --> 02:30:29.32
top of first because I'm getting them out of the water and like I felt like I had to apologize to them like

1601
02:30:29.32 --> 02:30:37.48
the team was amazing that day the team did everything and a lot of these guys you know kept going

1602
02:30:37.48 --> 02:30:43.16
for years and years after I got out like I don't know why I'm getting this

1603
02:30:44.60 --> 02:30:49.64
well it's awesome I'm sure they all thought to themselves well the maybe the fact that you

1604
02:30:49.64 --> 02:30:57.32
saved my life and get me alive might be the reason so yeah that's unbelievable awesome story

1605
02:30:57.32 --> 02:31:02.68
um and sounds like there was definitely some good smooth government operating and there as well

1606
02:31:03.32 --> 02:31:08.68
in the end they worked out it worked out to be pretty good secret yeah it's pretty awesome but

1607
02:31:08.68 --> 02:31:13.64
they kept it from you they kept it you know after we stepped out of the oval John Kelly's like

1608
02:31:13.64 --> 02:31:19.96
sorry I had a pull a trick on you okay yeah he's like such an honest guy that he felt guilty about that

1609
02:31:19.96 --> 02:31:25.32
yeah right like such a good guy is like I'm really sorry I didn't do that it's okay so I forgot

1610
02:31:25.32 --> 02:31:33.32
give you and then um how when when you go talking about the cancer a little bit when you go

1611
02:31:33.32 --> 02:31:40.60
in for radiation when you go in for chemo like I you know no no people have gone on chemo

1612
02:31:40.60 --> 02:31:52.36
for it's like crushing physically so with with my treatments we're in a reassessment phase right now

1613
02:31:52.36 --> 02:31:59.16
to figure out what we're doing but for the last couple years I've been on uh it's a

1614
02:31:59.96 --> 02:32:04.92
okay it's super super far out in the weeds but it's a targeted therapy for my for my very

1615
02:32:04.92 --> 02:32:13.48
specific kind of lung cancer and so I take one pill every day and you know it's got me two years

1616
02:32:13.48 --> 02:32:26.60
down the road so the there's ups and downs with it some you know definitely some side effects

1617
02:32:27.64 --> 02:32:33.88
I think general speaking it's better than what you think of as chemo I know it's

1618
02:32:35.88 --> 02:32:42.12
pissed off a lot of keyboard warriors and and the sergeant majors out there in the world that I

1619
02:32:42.12 --> 02:32:50.04
didn't shave for the for the ceremony and I was like well because I had a rash from from my

1620
02:32:50.04 --> 02:32:57.88
treatment so I physically couldn't shave at the time but some people took a fence like sorry I really

1621
02:32:57.88 --> 02:33:07.000
I want I want I want I want that and it was you know I would just that's awesome that's

1622
02:33:07.000 --> 02:33:12.04
all the numeric air could you say oh that guy got the metal of honor you might want to shave next time

1623
02:33:13.56 --> 02:33:23.08
that's that's professional jealousy and it's finest right yeah and so I've been trying to

1624
02:33:23.08 --> 02:33:27.64
chase down too many people but a few of them and like I'll just say you know like this is why

1625
02:33:27.64 --> 02:33:33.88
have a nice day and uh and then what are you doing day to day now so are you still you work

1626
02:33:33.88 --> 02:33:37.64
and right now secret service you have to put any time with them or you on like some medical leave

1627
02:33:37.64 --> 02:33:43.08
right now did you stay in the secret service? I yeah I'm still still with the secret service

1628
02:33:43.08 --> 02:33:47.48
some a few people will ask me now what the metal like secret service just to cover my now

1629
02:33:48.68 --> 02:33:52.12
that's what I did well after you met that but when I was talking my wife you know my wife has

1630
02:33:52.12 --> 02:33:59.24
been talking to your wife and I said something along the lines of like oh you know what we'll

1631
02:33:59.24 --> 02:34:03.08
talk about you know and using the secret to the secret service and my wife said in my wife's

1632
02:34:03.08 --> 02:34:09.72
a Brit so she isn't like fully comprehend American government like an American does but you know

1633
02:34:09.72 --> 02:34:13.48
I said you know we'll probably talk about you know him being in the secret service and my wife of

1634
02:34:13.48 --> 02:34:23.72
course literally says but isn't that a secret? So yeah could cover a cover for your

1635
02:34:24.44 --> 02:34:31.96
cover and operations that you're now conducting yeah yeah no it's yeah so once I once I was a

1636
02:34:31.96 --> 02:34:37.16
diagnosed a couple years ago I just switched over for being operational and counterparts you

1637
02:34:38.44 --> 02:34:42.84
when I'm gonna say operations the have an arm in the operation section got it got it so I just send emails

1638
02:34:42.84 --> 02:34:47.24
to people and I'm I'm a keyboard warrior myself now like you are not working hard enough for

1639
02:34:47.24 --> 02:34:55.88
harder you might want to shave while you're working hard you're by the way yeah and and that's

1640
02:34:55.88 --> 02:35:02.84
uh and then you got your your wife and your kids and how old are your kids? Uh our our boys are older

1641
02:35:02.84 --> 02:35:08.52
son Cameron who said it was was three months at the time of the battle he's he's 11 now and our

1642
02:35:08.52 --> 02:35:15.80
younger son Tyler he's he's eight so you know my wife has you know multiple full-time jobs

1643
02:35:15.80 --> 02:35:21.72
you're trying to keep those kids you know where they need to be when they need to be there like

1644
02:35:21.72 --> 02:35:29.24
with the secret service um I can't remember these exact day count but the last year I was like

1645
02:35:29.24 --> 02:35:35.16
fully able to travel in for the extra level like a hundred and thirty days or something and you know

1646
02:35:35.16 --> 02:35:41.08
at least well like the military time deployments like you're gonna leave in August like okay that's

1647
02:35:41.08 --> 02:35:46.68
in the future I know when it is you're gonna be gone for seven months whereas you know the secret

1648
02:35:46.68 --> 02:35:54.60
service we're dependent on people. Mm-hmm. Does the president want to go over here if he does

1649
02:35:55.16 --> 02:35:59.96
we're going guess what it doesn't matter what we had scheduled next week it's going to happen

1650
02:36:01.88 --> 02:36:07.48
so you know in the hundred three days on sound that bad it's two days here three days there

1651
02:36:07.48 --> 02:36:17.08
are a call it 8 p.m. tomorrow morning you're on a plane at six a.m. get packed so you know she's she's

1652
02:36:17.08 --> 02:36:22.84
she's been she was amazing at balancing all of those things I came came with a job and then

1653
02:36:25.24 --> 02:36:31.56
then I threw in a monkey wrench with the hole I have cancer everywhere it's making more about me now

1654
02:36:31.56 --> 02:36:41.88
so it's because the kids were um what was that kindergarten and third grade I think were the ages

1655
02:36:42.44 --> 02:36:47.08
right I know it's like they were just starting to get a little bit easier and you know she's kind

1656
02:36:47.08 --> 02:36:52.84
of come out for air like yeah hold on I need to I need to challenge you a little more sorry about that

1657
02:36:53.96 --> 02:36:59.16
well it's you know sounds like and I met her today seems like awesome awesome woman awesome family and

1658
02:36:59.16 --> 02:37:05.88
um I mean just a incredible story from for everything that you've done and what you've been

1659
02:37:05.88 --> 02:37:10.76
through what you're going through and the perseverance that you're showing is just um the perseverance

1660
02:37:10.76 --> 02:37:16.60
that you showed and the perseverance that you continue to show is just it's awesome man and probably

1661
02:37:16.60 --> 02:37:22.92
you're probably a good that's a good place of any to uh trying to wrap this up um but you know

1662
02:37:22.92 --> 02:37:29.72
man thanks for coming on and and really thanks for thanks for giving it an example to everyone

1663
02:37:29.72 --> 02:37:36.20
of you know how to how to how to train how to fight and how to live it's uh it's awesome

1664
02:37:36.20 --> 02:37:40.76
well I appreciate saying that and you know I'm not just you know saying this because I'm on your show

1665
02:37:40.76 --> 02:37:47.56
like I I've been listening to your your podcasts for a long time I I've listened to many

1666
02:37:47.56 --> 02:37:53.16
different episodes but there's one in particular where you you know you do the book views and

1667
02:37:53.16 --> 02:37:59.08
uh the a man search for meaning you did that one I think like two or three months after I

1668
02:37:59.08 --> 02:38:08.60
died diagnosed and that was I mean I like to think I'm a determined guy and like I can focus through

1669
02:38:08.60 --> 02:38:15.16
stuff but you know the cancer battles definitely very different than an army battle like again

1670
02:38:15.16 --> 02:38:20.60
we could just gust earlier like if you could shoot me I could shoot you we'll see this is that kind of

1671
02:38:20.60 --> 02:38:27.24
behind this scenes unknown enemy and so just you know hearing about like that book and then

1672
02:38:27.24 --> 02:38:32.76
I mean it went out and got the book read it like just stuff so you know your podcast is definitely

1673
02:38:33.72 --> 02:38:39.32
you know not only on those long boring nights where you can't sleep because this this

1674
02:38:39.32 --> 02:38:46.28
hurts and that hurts like something to listen to but it's definitely been very meaningful to

1675
02:38:46.28 --> 02:38:53.32
me and in those respects so I really appreciate it and hopefully hopefully with someone or

1676
02:38:54.12 --> 02:39:00.68
you know interesting today oh man no it's that's it's awesome and we'll we'll keep doing it

1677
02:39:00.68 --> 02:39:10.28
echo speaking of the podcast speaking of you know taking the fight to the enemy scene and on scene sure

1678
02:39:10.28 --> 02:39:16.28
yeah big time I know you like to you know give us some ideas some some help along the past

1679
02:39:16.28 --> 02:39:22.52
yeah I have a question first okay so when you got hit in the arm that time that you didn't

1680
02:39:22.52 --> 02:39:28.04
realize it or whatever like what was that like a ricochet or something just the bullet dude yeah but like

1681
02:39:28.04 --> 02:39:34.92
what was you know what happened with it I mean it's the tiny as little scar you can barely see it

1682
02:39:35.56 --> 02:39:41.16
it's like like it just barely grazed you kind of thing yeah grazed I mean when I when I got the

1683
02:39:41.16 --> 02:39:45.000
uniform off I mean there was there was like there was cut there was bleeding there was bruising

1684
02:39:46.20 --> 02:39:52.12
like I said it couldn't because it's okay so much stuff is going on that like boom yeah you get hit

1685
02:39:52.12 --> 02:39:58.04
but then it kind of gets blended in with all the rest of the chaos kind of thing yeah I mean so much

1686
02:39:58.04 --> 02:40:03.40
with the the air strikes stuff we were talking about like stuff was stuff was just hitting you

1687
02:40:03.40 --> 02:40:14.28
so falling on you stuff was it was just stuff was always going on so yeah I was hit shot you know

1688
02:40:14.28 --> 02:40:21.40
hey yeah you know what else is crazy is I just you know like echo doesn't ever write anything down

1689
02:40:22.12 --> 02:40:27.80
during these things and you made that statement like probably like 45 minutes ago but echo

1690
02:40:27.80 --> 02:40:31.56
has just been sitting there thinking like dang what happened yeah well it can be expanded on that

1691
02:40:31.56 --> 02:40:35.96
yeah you were so excited come I got that question I'm coming at you wrong

1692
02:40:37.24 --> 02:40:42.20
well yeah you sort of wonder because you just sort of mentioned it you know like all kind of like

1693
02:40:42.20 --> 02:40:46.44
on your work Terminator 1 of first one where they kind of recover from the shootout and then

1694
02:40:46.44 --> 02:40:51.48
they're under the bridge and then and they got she um sorry kind of goes hey like what's up you

1695
02:40:51.48 --> 02:40:55.48
know he goes oh yeah he got me right there and just sort of glosses over it she's like you

1696
02:40:55.48 --> 02:41:00.68
you got shot like oh what's up that's how I was feeling with you you know I'm saying well

1697
02:41:02.36 --> 02:41:08.92
luckily I mean it what was I did did you shot it but luckily you know for my sake and for

1698
02:41:08.92 --> 02:41:14.36
rea the people just not knowing when it was yeah it wasn't worse because it's not gonna be deal let

1699
02:41:14.36 --> 02:41:23.80
let me keep keep going about about about about the job yeah it's crazy now no meters and inches

1700
02:41:24.20 --> 02:41:31.64
no meters and inches but yeah so yeah if we're staying on the path speaking the witch okay let's

1701
02:41:31.64 --> 02:41:39.08
start with origin forging up in Maine American made company American founded company it just an

1702
02:41:39.08 --> 02:41:43.64
American company I think there it sums it up yeah but they go deep with American made though that's

1703
02:41:43.64 --> 02:41:49.40
the thing true so anyway so you're doing jiu jitsu which we all are you want to get you get it from

1704
02:41:49.40 --> 02:41:56.28
origin all made in America new gear out by the way out a real good on have you used it yeah I know

1705
02:41:56.28 --> 02:42:02.44
you're kind of off the jiu jitsu for a little bit yeah yeah got a little got a little dinged up in the knee

1706
02:42:02.44 --> 02:42:11.64
area but you used it yes good assessment so legit as we say in the industry yeah yeah

1707
02:42:11.64 --> 02:42:19.000
also rashguards on there even the existing geese are good our exceptional actually they're the

1708
02:42:19.000 --> 02:42:23.80
best in the world factually made by jiu jitsu people in America with American made

1709
02:42:23.80 --> 02:42:34.76
products how much here you are as did you do how much rolling did you do we did a fair amount

1710
02:42:34.76 --> 02:42:41.24
and then at some point like I mentioned one that the jiu jitsu are to show it up and kind of reset

1711
02:42:41.24 --> 02:42:49.72
the way we're training we did a little less rolling and he found some I just outside for it brags

1712
02:42:49.72 --> 02:42:55.72
like I just meant in fights and I think he was from Miami he's like I've been in fights in Miami

1713
02:42:55.72 --> 02:43:01.24
for years and years he was really good at it apparently so we did a little less rolling with him

1714
02:43:01.24 --> 02:43:05.64
because he you know kind of brought up the point like with all the stuff you're carrying if you end

1715
02:43:05.64 --> 02:43:11.48
up on the ground that's not a good day for you yeah well let's end up on the ground the new

1716
02:43:11.48 --> 02:43:17.24
better no one you're like even with all that stuff on yeah so yeah we he kind of just taught us a

1717
02:43:17.24 --> 02:43:24.12
different way you know fighting if you get on the ground yeah get back up it's great as you can

1718
02:43:24.12 --> 02:43:28.60
yeah that's I always say like the primary the primary purpose of jiu jitsu in the self defense

1719
02:43:28.60 --> 02:43:33.08
situation is to get up and get away from them not to put a triangle on them or put some kind of

1720
02:43:33.08 --> 02:43:39.80
a you know pull guard on the guy like yeah that's not smart no and the other funny thing is

1721
02:43:41.72 --> 02:43:45.40
like I always you know I always talk about jiu jitsu being important and all that stuff

1722
02:43:45.40 --> 02:43:50.68
but like in the seal teams people would get really in the combatives which is cool I'm down

1723
02:43:50.68 --> 02:43:56.12
with being in the combatives I am totally into combatives I'm totally into MMA and jiu jitsu and

1724
02:43:56.12 --> 02:44:02.92
wrestling and boxing and mojitai and whatever else I can find that is effective but if you have a

1725
02:44:02.92 --> 02:44:08.04
choice between being really good at shooting your guns and being really good at arm walking

1726
02:44:08.04 --> 02:44:13.000
people if you're in the if you're in the military it's better to be good at shooting your guns

1727
02:44:13.000 --> 02:44:18.68
now luckily I'm here to tell you you can get good at both but prioritize being able to shoot

1728
02:44:18.68 --> 02:44:24.52
really well yes well most of my workouts now with with the whole cancer thing are just

1729
02:44:24.52 --> 02:44:28.84
walks but not I about check out one of these keys and to walk around the oh wait don't you

1730
02:44:28.84 --> 02:44:34.36
like in what we get we get you get you keys for your kids too because your kids should be doing

1731
02:44:34.36 --> 02:44:42.04
jiu jitsu that's for sure if you agree but also on there there are a pair of items fashionable

1732
02:44:42.84 --> 02:44:48.44
we don't know if you don't like the word he doesn't like the concept I get it but the fact remains

1733
02:44:48.44 --> 02:44:53.08
Pete you know so Pete Roberts found her of origin yeah it was a little bit of an ambition

1734
02:44:53.08 --> 02:44:58.68
Pete my partner up in up in Maine he's got like a little he's got a little fashion sense to

1735
02:44:58.68 --> 02:45:04.44
do you know a little sprinkle of it which I have zero so there's a contrast there you know people talk about

1736
02:45:06.04 --> 02:45:14.20
color what I have to say that yeah yeah yeah as long as it's black yeah or gray or again it

1737
02:45:14.20 --> 02:45:19.72
yeah so anyways anyway also supplements what best kind of supplements join supplements apparently

1738
02:45:20.28 --> 02:45:25.08
when we were young we're about the same age I've estimated when were you born right about 78

1739
02:45:25.08 --> 02:45:30.60
I'm at a different for you yeah so you're one year younger than me nonetheless back when we were young

1740
02:45:30.60 --> 02:45:36.68
we thought what protein supplements right create member creating yes and once I call

1741
02:45:36.68 --> 02:45:40.04
yeah that's the creating that's so much of that stuff no as it turned out

1742
02:45:40.04 --> 02:45:44.76
that's not even as important not even nearly as important as joint supplement so

1743
02:45:44.76 --> 02:45:52.20
jocco of course makes supplements jocco joint warfare for what anti-inflammatory stuff

1744
02:45:52.20 --> 02:45:58.76
glucosamine congenital super krill oil krill oil very important for your joints um keeps you in the

1745
02:45:58.76 --> 02:46:07.16
game even at our age I am tripling up on joint warfare right now to help the recovery process

1746
02:46:07.16 --> 02:46:12.12
of my day oh yeah man the joint war and the krill oil combo whatever when you're consistent

1747
02:46:12.12 --> 02:46:17.88
I mean you could stay consistent so I get it but I have a experience with inconsistency so

1748
02:46:17.88 --> 02:46:24.36
when when I get consistent man it's like you're on this like road like you know he could

1749
02:46:24.36 --> 02:46:29.16
dinged up or whatever but like you go it's like they heal up so quick and I don't want to make like

1750
02:46:29.16 --> 02:46:34.36
oh you're like what's the kind of the X man guy who heals over him I'm not necessarily saying

1751
02:46:34.36 --> 02:46:38.28
you're like Wolverine but you feel like you kind of are Wolverine like you when you get you know

1752
02:46:38.28 --> 02:46:44.20
how like me anyway when I get hurt we're like dinged up on like dang how long am I out now you know

1753
02:46:44.20 --> 02:46:49.08
a week two weeks whatever like with this I like I don't even worry about it just in the game just

1754
02:46:49.08 --> 02:46:54.68
in the game consistently taking it so I dig it this is what I'm saying well since you mentioned Wolverine

1755
02:46:54.68 --> 02:47:01.80
I'll say that with my you know SF and then cancer like we spent more time my wife and I

1756
02:47:01.80 --> 02:47:06.20
talking about the possibility that that phone call was somebody gonna enroll me in the dead

1757
02:47:06.20 --> 02:47:13.56
we're all okay then with any man else we'd literally like conversations yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

1758
02:47:13.56 --> 02:47:18.52
yeah given everything you know yeah you might be a good candidate for this new program we're putting

1759
02:47:18.52 --> 02:47:27.24
together my little little daughter she watches those what is it Avengers so she watches that stuff

1760
02:47:27.24 --> 02:47:33.56
does that have Wolverine in it? no right no that's X man X man is okay well she watches those things

1761
02:47:33.56 --> 02:47:38.52
it's one of but the other day and she's also kind of gobble right because she's nine and she

1762
02:47:38.52 --> 02:47:43.40
kind of she's a little bobble you know I mean and she's nine but the other day I started to

1763
02:47:43.40 --> 02:47:47.08
start at this whole like thing with her where I was kind of telling us like yeah you know

1764
02:47:47.48 --> 02:47:51.32
because I was saying oh my knee I was like you know my knee it'll heal up quickly and I said

1765
02:47:51.32 --> 02:47:56.52
then I said then like I got the little idea in my head of something creative to play a game to play

1766
02:47:56.52 --> 02:48:01.88
sure and so I said like yeah you know it's weird sweetie because whenever I get into it it heals

1767
02:48:01.88 --> 02:48:07.24
up really really fast it it's really weird it's always been like that well not always I

1768
02:48:08.92 --> 02:48:13.24
and then I started saying well you know one time it's really weird but I had this weird memory of like

1769
02:48:14.28 --> 02:48:19.24
when when I was in the navy and I went to the doctor and then I didn't remember things for a while

1770
02:48:19.24 --> 02:48:25.80
and I remember like then putting things in me and her eyes were so big she was so stuck

1771
02:48:25.80 --> 02:48:34.28
to her about another minute and she thought I was blown because I started up when you start on

1772
02:48:34.28 --> 02:48:39.48
when something comes from them right so it was her that said like oh how long you're gonna be

1773
02:48:39.48 --> 02:48:44.68
hurt for so she initiate this whole conversation yeah it gives me a massive advantage in this trick

1774
02:48:44.68 --> 02:48:50.36
about to play because I'm playing the trick based on on her reality right yeah I like you just

1775
02:48:50.36 --> 02:48:55.40
came out of the blue come on the tree with some trick or some conversation no it's part of what she

1776
02:48:55.40 --> 02:49:00.44
she ran an asthma you know I wasn't just sitting there plotting on it yeah kind of so that's

1777
02:49:00.44 --> 02:49:07.40
kind of like you think how you make like when you when you come up with a plan or correction to a

1778
02:49:07.40 --> 02:49:11.64
plan or whatever like how you lead people and I see what you're doing when you do it but it's

1779
02:49:11.64 --> 02:49:16.12
still works by the way so you lead people to think that they made the plan yeah yes you just did

1780
02:49:16.12 --> 02:49:20.44
that to your daughter yeah she's not in the practice under yeah yeah that's how I see again

1781
02:49:20.44 --> 02:49:27.32
I know I get it fully yeah check nonetheless supplements more kids well additional proteins

1782
02:49:27.32 --> 02:49:31.96
yeah yeah I still don't neglect the protein don't get it wrong I just find the joint supplements to

1783
02:49:31.96 --> 02:49:37.32
be somebody asked me on Twitter if I was on growth hormone or because of the way I looked

1784
02:49:38.36 --> 02:49:44.92
and uh reasonable though I said I was actually it was actually supposed to be a derogatory

1785
02:49:44.92 --> 02:49:49.24
comment because it was one of those little clips that someone put up with me talking about something

1786
02:49:49.24 --> 02:49:55.32
and and then someone with the the shot and then said that why would I listen this guy who looks

1787
02:49:55.32 --> 02:50:02.92
ex been on growth hormone in my life right and uh and I just replied back like I've never been

1788
02:50:02.92 --> 02:50:13.08
on any kind of growth hormone unless you count steak so anyways I have fun on Twitter yeah

1789
02:50:13.08 --> 02:50:21.32
that's how I know you have Twitter I don't use Twitter that much I'm trying to try to

1790
02:50:21.32 --> 02:50:27.56
figure out Instagram thing yeah Twitter just still doesn't make sense my brain Instagram is also

1791
02:50:27.96 --> 02:50:34.28
can be fun but Twitter is basically just a bunch of one miners it's just a bunch of one miners

1792
02:50:34.28 --> 02:50:38.92
that's all it is one miners and it's just 24 hours a day if if you want to sit there and make

1793
02:50:38.92 --> 02:50:43.40
one miners all day long you know that's what you can do with that thing it's a good way to put it

1794
02:50:43.40 --> 02:50:49.000
it's just one money and then what's what's lame about it or good about it depending on your perspective

1795
02:50:49.000 --> 02:50:55.000
is if you and I are having a conversation and you say something anizing like I hit it that took

1796
02:50:55.000 --> 02:51:00.76
a little quick thinking with Twitter you could actually sit there and look at it for 12 men you could

1797
02:51:00.76 --> 02:51:05.96
look up words even the dictionary if you wanted to and you could say oh this is gonna be really

1798
02:51:05.96 --> 02:51:10.84
windy you could plan it out you can do some research and then you can respond and for all

1799
02:51:10.84 --> 02:51:15.32
anyone knows you just looked at that and just threw it out there so you just got the notification

1800
02:51:15.32 --> 02:51:20.60
yeah you just saw it and I'm just throwing out this advanced shot that gets you

1801
02:51:21.40 --> 02:51:26.52
whereas the reality is that's not what I'm having so it's a really interesting now I will say

1802
02:51:26.52 --> 02:51:31.48
sometimes because I go on to Twitter and I reply like a lot at once because I don't sit there

1803
02:51:31.48 --> 02:51:35.96
and look at Twitter all the time so then I go back and I just reply really fast so a lot of times

1804
02:51:35.96 --> 02:51:43.000
I will do things that are you know just like in a case that I make mistakes you know there's someone

1805
02:51:43.000 --> 02:51:47.80
on Twitter called the there's a Twitter thing called grammar police yeah what do you mean like

1806
02:51:47.80 --> 02:51:53.80
an hour or just a comment on it's an account okay I used and I was an English major

1807
02:51:53.80 --> 02:51:58.20
Ron and I know you're an economics guy okay you're in the numbers I'm in the letters

1808
02:51:58.20 --> 02:52:08.12
so I put your and again I'm tweeting at a 47 tweets a minute I'm just boom boom and I used

1809
02:52:08.12 --> 02:52:17.000
your y-o-u-r instead of y-o-u-r apostrophe-e

1810
02:52:18.12 --> 02:52:21.32
you even said apostrophe-e-r-e

1811
02:52:21.32 --> 02:52:29.72
and so then and so then up pops like probably an hour later up pops grammar police and it says

1812
02:52:30.28 --> 02:52:34.92
and it's it's really I actually love the way they do it they don't they don't they're not

1813
02:52:34.92 --> 02:52:42.04
disparaging to you they just say for your information you used the wrong your the proper

1814
02:52:43.24 --> 02:52:47.000
you know the proper grammar in this scenario would have been to use

1815
02:52:47.000 --> 02:52:51.88
y-o-u apostrophe-e thank you and please correct yourself next time it signed grammar

1816
02:52:51.88 --> 02:52:58.44
peace so I like the grammar police that's a good account yeah thank anyway so it's an actual like

1817
02:52:58.44 --> 02:53:03.64
account the kind of police like a person it's not a boss somebody's a server well it may be odd

1818
02:53:03.64 --> 02:53:07.08
it may be a bot but it's a grammar police account you can follow I should probably follow

1819
02:53:07.08 --> 02:53:12.36
the grandmothers I'm going to what are the pictures they share them just yeah Twitter

1820
02:53:12.36 --> 02:53:13.96
Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter

1821
02:53:13.96 --> 02:53:17.000
Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter yeah yeah okay i mean I guess insin gestellt you could just

1822
02:53:17.000 --> 02:53:21.40
you they could have they could have blown up a picture an image of my incorrect you know

1823
02:53:21.40 --> 02:53:25.72
message of or it no were who would just slide in the comments but right because you would

1824
02:53:25.72 --> 02:53:15.96
and early you don't need a picture for comments so it'd be like sure what youine

1825
02:53:29.32 --> 02:53:33.72
you know we think and then they'd just slide in the comments but they should know

1826
02:53:34.52 --> 02:53:37.56
that hurts because like I was an English major

1827
02:53:37.56 --> 02:53:38.92
There, there, there, there.

1828
02:53:38.92 --> 02:53:40.20
Only way you'll learn though.

1829
02:53:40.20 --> 02:53:41.20
Yeah, there you go.

1830
02:53:41.20 --> 02:53:46.52
Uh, we got to eat some warrior kid milk for your kids, Ron.

1831
02:53:46.52 --> 02:53:50.16
Do you, when you were a kid, did you ever drink strawberry

1832
02:53:50.16 --> 02:53:51.16
quick?

1833
02:53:51.16 --> 02:53:52.16
Yes.

1834
02:53:52.16 --> 02:53:53.16
Did you like it?

1835
02:53:53.16 --> 02:53:54.16
No.

1836
02:53:54.16 --> 02:53:55.68
Okay, what about chocolate quick?

1837
02:53:55.68 --> 02:53:56.68
Yes.

1838
02:53:56.68 --> 02:53:57.68
Did you like it?

1839
02:53:57.68 --> 02:53:58.68
Yes.

1840
02:53:58.68 --> 02:53:59.68
Okay.

1841
02:53:59.68 --> 02:54:00.68
There you go.

1842
02:54:00.68 --> 02:54:03.16
Well, for me, strawberry quick was kind of like a big thing

1843
02:54:03.16 --> 02:54:05.36
for me when I was looking at it.

1844
02:54:05.36 --> 02:54:08.20
The fake strawberry flavors, it's so hit and miss.

1845
02:54:08.20 --> 02:54:09.20
Yeah.

1846
02:54:09.20 --> 02:54:15.28
Well, either one, if you happen to like strawberry quick, basically

1847
02:54:15.28 --> 02:54:19.88
are this kid's protein drink tastes exactly like that.

1848
02:54:19.88 --> 02:54:20.88
It's delicious.

1849
02:54:20.88 --> 02:54:21.88
It would be, it's delicious to me.

1850
02:54:21.88 --> 02:54:22.64
It wouldn't be delicious to you.

1851
02:54:22.64 --> 02:54:23.88
I guess you'd spit it out.

1852
02:54:23.88 --> 02:54:24.88
I would spit it out.

1853
02:54:24.88 --> 02:54:25.88
I'd be polite.

1854
02:54:25.88 --> 02:54:27.88
I'd be so drinkin' me like, oh, this is good.

1855
02:54:27.88 --> 02:54:28.88
Thanks for that.

1856
02:54:28.88 --> 02:54:31.48
Uh, if you were doing that kind of, you're spotting it.

1857
02:54:31.48 --> 02:54:33.12
Yeah, so you'd be cool about it.

1858
02:54:33.12 --> 02:54:35.12
Well, your kids, hopefully they have better taste

1859
02:54:35.12 --> 02:54:36.12
but the new.

1860
02:54:36.12 --> 02:54:37.12
I definitely like it.

1861
02:54:37.12 --> 02:54:38.84
Well, this stuff is amazing.

1862
02:54:38.84 --> 02:54:40.12
So anyways, that's where your kid mulk.

1863
02:54:40.12 --> 02:54:41.52
And it doesn't have any sugar.

1864
02:54:41.52 --> 02:54:42.28
And it's actually good for you.

1865
02:54:42.28 --> 02:54:44.16
It's got protein and vitamins and probiotics.

1866
02:54:44.16 --> 02:54:45.16
It's awesome.

1867
02:54:45.16 --> 02:54:46.16
So anyways, that's that.

1868
02:54:46.16 --> 02:54:47.48
Also, chocolate store.

1869
02:54:47.48 --> 02:54:48.84
It's called Jocco store.

1870
02:54:48.84 --> 02:54:50.08
That's where you can get a pair of.

1871
02:54:50.08 --> 02:54:51.08
Jocco apparel.

1872
02:54:51.08 --> 02:54:52.08
It's a good thing.

1873
02:54:52.08 --> 02:54:53.08
It's so fashionable.

1874
02:54:53.08 --> 02:54:54.08
Yes.

1875
02:54:54.08 --> 02:54:56.08
Well, you know, you see that I caught him in this.

1876
02:54:56.08 --> 02:54:57.08
Yeah, big day.

1877
02:54:57.08 --> 02:54:58.08
And try going there.

1878
02:54:58.08 --> 02:55:00.32
The thing is it's like it's not even fashionable.

1879
02:55:00.32 --> 02:55:01.32
But here's the thing.

1880
02:55:01.32 --> 02:55:06.32
So snug. I had to sneak in covertly and insert elements.

1881
02:55:06.32 --> 02:55:07.32
Sprinkles.

1882
02:55:07.32 --> 02:55:08.32
A fashion.

1883
02:55:08.32 --> 02:55:09.32
Pete Roberts style.

1884
02:55:09.32 --> 02:55:11.32
Not quite that hardcore.

1885
02:55:11.32 --> 02:55:13.32
Hardcore fashion.

1886
02:55:13.32 --> 02:55:14.32
It's like, but it's like Zoolander.

1887
02:55:14.32 --> 02:55:17.32
Yeah, you're mine.

1888
02:55:17.32 --> 02:55:19.32
I'm like Zoolander.

1889
02:55:19.32 --> 02:55:24.32
And you're my, the, um, the, so, so Jocco's design, right?

1890
02:55:24.32 --> 02:55:25.32
It's like his thing.

1891
02:55:27.32 --> 02:55:28.32
It's like not even design.

1892
02:55:28.32 --> 02:55:30.32
The font he uses is like computer font.

1893
02:55:30.32 --> 02:55:34.14
font literally not so it's like oh see our whatever so he's like you know just

1894
02:55:34.14 --> 02:55:38.40
playing in cool screen you know we'll put it on the shirt I'm like cool so I look

1895
02:55:38.40 --> 02:55:43.80
at I'm like okay I dig it but at least I made the shirt like the shirt material

1896
02:55:43.80 --> 02:55:47.72
it's like you know a blend and all this stuff it's not like some cheap what he

1897
02:55:47.72 --> 02:55:53.56
call like a boxy rug it I don't call anything I call it a shirt yeah see and

1898
02:55:53.56 --> 02:55:57.44
that's my point right there super saying so the designs are gonna be super

1899
02:55:57.44 --> 02:56:02.52
basic non-fashionable but when you get the apparel you can be like oh this is

1900
02:56:02.52 --> 02:56:06.68
really wearable stuff is really nice that's what I predict you'll think you

1901
02:56:06.68 --> 02:56:11.64
know if if if history's in the indicator but anyway uh t-shirts on there we've

1902
02:56:11.64 --> 02:56:15.12
got some light weight hoodies on there which jock or even down for the light

1903
02:56:15.12 --> 02:56:19.72
weight hood because so far people everyone now every single person who was

1904
02:56:19.72 --> 02:56:22.72
like siding with jock on in real life I'm not talking about internet

1905
02:56:22.72 --> 02:56:26.52
siding with jock will say yeah hoodies are for like when you're cold you

1906
02:56:26.52 --> 02:56:29.92
know a heavy hoodie otherwise why even wearing a hoodie just where I

1907
02:56:29.92 --> 02:56:33.52
sure right everybody you know everybody okay let's talk about something

1908
02:56:33.52 --> 02:56:37.36

1911
02:56:45.24 --> 02:56:49.94

1912
02:56:49.94 --> 02:56:53.44
already knew that that's why we did it like with hoodie's but he's just the

1913
02:56:53.44 --> 02:56:58.92
rash guards for jits to end of this life and life man you know some

1917
02:57:13.48 --> 02:57:19.28
wait it's the best to you ever tried it's better than strawberry quick it's way

1918
02:57:19.28 --> 02:57:23.64
better than strawberry quick I definitely would drink this strawberry quick

1919
02:57:23.64 --> 02:57:28.12
I mean if it has extra benefits of the probiotics and the protein maybe I'll

1920
02:57:28.12 --> 02:57:33.12
drink a little extra but cool if it's just strawberry quick now Ron has been

1921
02:57:33.12 --> 02:57:40.64
drinking jock a way tea with pomegranate anyways the good thing about it is it

got great information on leadership and human nature and history and war he was

1932
02:58:35.56 --> 02:58:42.52
but I unsubscribe to it because they spend a lot of times on some episodes

1933
02:58:42.52 --> 02:58:46.76
talking about jiu jitsu which I don't do and this this wasn't a review on

1934
02:58:46.76 --> 02:58:52.000
items this was a review that he wrote in a blog and tagged me in it on Twitter

1938
02:59:09.20 --> 02:59:14.52
so there you go whoever that guy was seemed like a nice enough guy but didn't

1939
02:59:14.52 --> 02:59:18.92

03:06:06.24 --> 03:06:11.36
and running in the right direction and we've got efo Overwatch as well and what we're doing with

2009
03:06:11.36 --> 03:06:19.20
efo Overwatch is taking proven leaders from spec ops and from combat aviation and putting them into

2010
03:06:19.84 --> 03:06:25.44
civilian jobs civilian sector leadership and don't always think you got to hire somebody that knows

2011
03:06:25.44 --> 03:06:31.92
everything technical about the situation hire someone for their leadership capability it's

2012
03:06:31.92 --> 03:06:36.72
easier to teach them the industry than it is to teach someone leadership so efo Overwatch.com

2056
03:12:16.24 --> 03:12:20.32
or anything I just I just share it just because I know the other people out there who are

2057
03:12:20.32 --> 03:12:27.92
getting diagnosed with cancer and they're getting those phone calls and I remember that I remember that

2058
03:12:27.92 --> 03:12:35.84
first call I got where it was like you know there's nothing you can do today and and he meant like

2059
03:12:35.84 --> 03:12:41.84
it was like a Friday afternoon I just found out the day before and it's going to the weekend but that

2060
03:12:43.44 --> 03:12:49.60
that crush of that well it's nothing you can do like what do you mean and so you know if I can just

2061
03:12:49.60 --> 03:12:57.20
put out that story that there's always hope there's always more you can do and you know the cancer

2062
03:12:58.000 --> 03:13:03.20
fight is not like combat where you get to go punch somebody in the face or shoot somebody in the face

2063
03:13:03.20 --> 03:13:11.92
and and have that like the the cancer fight is you know getting up and eating when you don't

2064
03:13:11.92 --> 03:13:17.68
want to eat so last thing in the world you want to do or you got to work out well let's just go

2065
03:13:17.68 --> 03:13:23.68
