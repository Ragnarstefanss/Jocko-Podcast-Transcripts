1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.50
This is Jocquopontcast number 267 with echo Charles and me jocquawilling good evening echo and

2
00:00:07.12 --> 00:00:15.16
Also joining us once again becoming a regular perhaps. I don't know. It certainly seems that way at least when we're dealing with the Marine Corps

3
00:00:15.16 --> 00:00:17.16
Dave Verk Good evening, Dave. Good evening

4
00:00:18.28 --> 00:00:21.28
All right, so we are three chapters down

5
00:00:22.56 --> 00:00:26.58
of Marine Corps doctrinal publication of one attack for called competing

6
00:00:26.58 --> 00:00:35.58
We're gonna knock out the last two today. I feel like we can do it. I feel like we can push through these last two because there's some examples that I I'm gonna skip over

7
00:00:38.46 --> 00:00:40.46
Last time

8
00:00:40.46 --> 00:00:42.46
I started to solve talking about how

9
00:00:43.46 --> 00:00:49.10
Tactical battle that can cause strategic defeat isn't a tackle battle at all. It's actually a strategic battle

10
00:00:49.10 --> 00:00:56.42
You got a big smile on your face when I said that last time Dave and then I actually heard you talking about it on to a client

11
00:00:56.54 --> 00:01:01.06
So that was cool, so where where where where soaking up knowledge here?

12
00:01:03.66 --> 00:01:05.66
And here's something else to think about

13
00:01:06.06 --> 00:01:07.58
so

14
00:01:07.58 --> 00:01:10.06
We're competing all the time right that's sort of this theme

15
00:01:11.26 --> 00:01:13.26
Or as echo would say that's sort of the theme

16
00:01:13.26 --> 00:01:21.98
Here's the question are we competing in the right things and

17
00:01:23.90 --> 00:01:27.02
This is where strategic thinking comes in again

18
00:01:28.06 --> 00:01:34.66
How much time and effort am I putting into a competition that doesn't matter

19
00:01:34.66 --> 00:01:43.86
We we have to think strategically how often are we competing and

20
00:01:45.38 --> 00:01:50.18
The sole reason that we are competing is because of where you go how often is that happening?

21
00:01:50.58 --> 00:01:53.74
It's insanity actually and it happens all the time new car

22
00:01:54.42 --> 00:01:56.42
Got to get the new car got to get the new car

23
00:01:57.70 --> 00:02:02.46
Got to get the the Rolex watch look I got nothing against Rolex watches whatever

24
00:02:02.46 --> 00:02:05.98
I kind of do have a fondness for timex watches perhaps

25
00:02:06.78 --> 00:02:13.26
But there's people that that they they want their competing they're looking at my watch as if I'm a lower human being

26
00:02:14.38 --> 00:02:22.10
Legitimately I'm a lower human being because their car is nicer than mine because their watch is nicer than mine because they have a title

27
00:02:23.70 --> 00:02:25.70
At their business, right?

28
00:02:25.70 --> 00:02:32.74
And so now I got to compete with them maybe I could try get that title maybe I can try and get them better watch

29
00:02:33.06 --> 00:02:36.62
Maybe I can try and use the plan that I came up with instead of playing that you came up with

30
00:02:38.42 --> 00:02:42.14
It seems so obvious that that's not that none of those things are good moves

31
00:02:44.42 --> 00:02:49.42
To get to get caught in the ecosystem competition

32
00:02:49.42 --> 00:02:57.70
Because if we take one step outside of that ecosystem one step outside of that ecosystem and no one cares

33
00:02:58.42 --> 00:03:00.42
There's no one that cares

34
00:03:01.94 --> 00:03:09.84
About whatever that thing that seems like you need to win you need to pour your effort into to win and you take one step outside of that ecosystem and

35
00:03:11.10 --> 00:03:13.10
And it's meaningless

36
00:03:13.10 --> 00:03:23.02
I can't tell the difference between a Rolex watch and and the Chinese made whatever what is that called a knockoff a knockoff

37
00:03:23.02 --> 00:03:28.34
I can't tell the difference doesn't matter to me some people would freak out about that

38
00:03:31.82 --> 00:03:34.82
We all like to win I get it I

39
00:03:36.54 --> 00:03:38.54
Get it

40
00:03:38.54 --> 00:03:40.54
our Eagles love to win

41
00:03:40.54 --> 00:03:44.22
Our Eagles love to win at

42
00:03:45.26 --> 00:03:49.90
Everything at anything or he goes or addicted to winning and it just thing about this

43
00:03:51.22 --> 00:03:53.22
Addicted to winning

44
00:03:53.94 --> 00:03:56.94
There's a lot of people that kind of I think yeah, oh, yeah

45
00:03:57.58 --> 00:04:02.06
Oh, you don't want to do to winning it sounds cool. It actually sounds cool

46
00:04:02.94 --> 00:04:05.58
Because I want to be a winner right obviously we are winner

47
00:04:05.58 --> 00:04:09.26
Because if I'm not a winner what am I

48
00:04:10.26 --> 00:04:13.50
You're a loser. I'm a loser and I don't want to be a loser. I want to be a winner

49
00:04:14.46 --> 00:04:16.70
Well, let me ask you this. What are you winning?

50
00:04:19.26 --> 00:04:21.26
What are you winning and

51
00:04:21.66 --> 00:04:24.62
How does that victory that you just achieved?

52
00:04:26.54 --> 00:04:31.18
Does it move you towards your long-term strategic goal?

53
00:04:31.18 --> 00:04:33.18
Does it I

54
00:04:37.10 --> 00:04:41.98
Was talking about this on on EF online today. I was talking about

55
00:04:44.30 --> 00:04:49.78
Rufly destroying my youngest daughter in monopoly

56
00:04:52.58 --> 00:04:54.78
You do where she doesn't want to play anymore, right?

57
00:04:55.90 --> 00:04:59.02
Tactical victory. I like to win

58
00:04:59.02 --> 00:05:02.86
I mean, we're talking about I think she was probably nine or ten at the time

59
00:05:03.74 --> 00:05:05.74
a couple years ago

60
00:05:05.74 --> 00:05:12.22
Anilated her had the entire had every property hotels on everything put her into debt

61
00:05:13.50 --> 00:05:18.14
Traided when she would land or want me. I'd trade you know rent for four of her properties

62
00:05:19.42 --> 00:05:21.74
Just completely annihilated her, right?

63
00:05:22.46 --> 00:05:24.46
Okay, great

64
00:05:24.46 --> 00:05:27.66
Now she has she doesn't want to play monopoly with me anymore

65
00:05:27.66 --> 00:05:29.66
She's not gonna play the game with me anymore

66
00:05:29.90 --> 00:05:33.50
So that's how is that was that a strategic good move for me? No

67
00:05:34.06 --> 00:05:37.66
Because it could be it's a great way to teach people to great way to teach your kids about

68
00:05:38.54 --> 00:05:43.98
Investing in real estate and mortgages and loans from the banks and interest you can do all kinds of cool stuff with monopoly

69
00:05:43.98 --> 00:05:45.98
I took all that through out the window

70
00:05:47.34 --> 00:05:50.94
Took it all into stood out the window. Why because I was gonna just win

71
00:05:53.18 --> 00:05:55.18
Now was there some strategy behind it?

72
00:05:55.18 --> 00:05:57.18
Little bit

73
00:05:58.14 --> 00:06:00.14
Don't mess with that

74
00:06:01.50 --> 00:06:03.50
But what but really

75
00:06:05.42 --> 00:06:12.14
Did that victory help me the answer is no no I would have been better off to had a good time

76
00:06:13.34 --> 00:06:15.34
Had her win

77
00:06:15.34 --> 00:06:19.02
Would have been would have been a better strategic move to play a good game

78
00:06:20.86 --> 00:06:22.86
Let her get some moves

79
00:06:22.86 --> 00:06:25.58
Look, wait or lose doesn't even really matter, but to have a good game a

80
00:06:26.46 --> 00:06:30.46
More balanced game would have been a better strategic move now. We have something fun to do, right?

81
00:06:31.50 --> 00:06:36.62
And again, there's all these teaching points that you can educate you can negotiate you can do negotiation training

82
00:06:37.58 --> 00:06:40.22
During monopolies all kinds of things that I threw away

83
00:06:42.86 --> 00:06:44.46
So

84
00:06:44.46 --> 00:06:47.50
That's bad and when we look at

85
00:06:47.90 --> 00:06:52.06
Look, we all want to say oh I'm super competitive hyper competitive

86
00:06:52.06 --> 00:06:55.58
I'm gonna tell you I know I am and I know a lot of people are

87
00:06:56.14 --> 00:06:58.86
We're competing all the time, but don't waste your time

88
00:07:00.14 --> 00:07:02.14
Competing in short-term

89
00:07:02.14 --> 00:07:05.42
Contests that don't lead you towards your strategic goal

90
00:07:08.06 --> 00:07:12.86
Remember that competing in the wrong arenas is bad

91
00:07:12.86 --> 00:07:22.30
Competing in the wrong arenas is bad pay attention to the arena that your competing is in it can be bad for you

92
00:07:22.30 --> 00:07:26.70
It can be bad for your family, it can be bad for your business, it can be bad for your life and it can be bad for the world

93
00:07:28.54 --> 00:07:30.62
Because you're focused on things that do not matter

94
00:07:31.50 --> 00:07:36.78
At a strategic level that's what you're competing at and by the way we can all name people

95
00:07:36.78 --> 00:07:42.94
That win and compete and win and compete and they compete and they win every single day

96
00:07:45.42 --> 00:07:47.42
Every single day they win and

97
00:07:48.70 --> 00:07:50.70
When you assess

98
00:07:50.70 --> 00:07:52.70
At the end of the day

99
00:07:53.50 --> 00:07:55.50
Where they end up?

100
00:07:55.90 --> 00:07:57.90
They end up

101
00:07:58.62 --> 00:07:59.90
Losers

102
00:08:00.30 --> 00:08:04.30
Despite all those wins they end up losing

103
00:08:04.30 --> 00:08:09.26
Because they're winning and they're competing in the wrong things

104
00:08:11.50 --> 00:08:18.06
So as much as as much as you know we've been sitting here this whole time talking about you're always competing and being being all fired up for that

105
00:08:18.62 --> 00:08:20.62
Here's the caution

106
00:08:20.62 --> 00:08:22.62
Pay attention

107
00:08:22.86 --> 00:08:24.30
Pay attention to what you're competing in

108
00:08:25.26 --> 00:08:27.26
Make sure it's having you in the right direction

109
00:08:31.18 --> 00:08:32.54
Got anything on that Dave?

110
00:08:32.54 --> 00:08:37.26
I saw you scratch it yeah, I saw some down so when you were talking about addicted to winning I wrote down

111
00:08:38.30 --> 00:08:39.50
at all costs

112
00:08:39.50 --> 00:08:43.34
They I'm gonna win it all costs and then as I'm listening to talk I wrote down

113
00:08:44.14 --> 00:08:48.22
Even if the cost is you the cost is to yourself and and it and

114
00:08:48.94 --> 00:08:52.86
You concluded with what you end up being you end up being a loser when you do that you win all the time

115
00:08:53.50 --> 00:08:57.18
And it's the willingness to compete to win at all costs

116
00:08:57.18 --> 00:09:02.94
And your ego is strong enough to let you compete at all costs even if the cost is two your own success in the long run

117
00:09:02.94 --> 00:09:08.30
Yeah, yeah, that's I think we talked about on this or on the underground podcast, but the winning at all costs

118
00:09:09.10 --> 00:09:16.14
Mustard thing that I did I should we should I should record I should capture that and release it the winning at all costs set up

119
00:09:17.10 --> 00:09:18.46
To make everyone think yeah

120
00:09:18.62 --> 00:09:22.54
We did all costs and then realize oh he's talking about something totally different

121
00:09:23.34 --> 00:09:25.34
Winning at all costs means

122
00:09:25.34 --> 00:09:29.74
Subordinate your ego means thinking strategically it means taking losses when it makes sense

123
00:09:31.10 --> 00:09:33.10
All things to think about

124
00:09:33.98 --> 00:09:35.74
All things to think about and with that

125
00:09:36.94 --> 00:09:41.66
Let's jump into back into the final day. I'm gonna go and predict this is the final day of

126
00:09:42.94 --> 00:09:44.54
Marine Corps

127
00:09:44.54 --> 00:09:55.82
Dr. Publication of one tack for competing and this first chapter is how rivals approach competition

128
00:09:56.14 --> 00:10:04.14
Starts off a friend of mine says that to try to describe what life is like in Russia to someone who has never been there is like trying to describe the mysteries of love

129
00:10:05.58 --> 00:10:07.58
to a person who has never experienced it

130
00:10:08.94 --> 00:10:11.42
That's from George cannon and then there's another

131
00:10:11.42 --> 00:10:20.38
Quote here complete competing effectively requires knowing your competition intimately how many hundreds of times have we heard that one

132
00:10:21.18 --> 00:10:23.50
Only by understanding a competitor's world view

133
00:10:24.38 --> 00:10:27.26
Decision making and behavioral

134
00:10:27.26 --> 00:10:34.94
Proclivities can one out maneuver that competitor only by grasping arrivals weaknesses and fears can one exploit them

135
00:10:34.94 --> 00:10:40.78
Such understanding in turn requires sustained intellectual and economic investment that's from how brands he's a historian

136
00:10:43.02 --> 00:10:46.46
Son of H W brands famous historian. I guess they're both famous

137
00:10:48.94 --> 00:10:50.94
That's a really long sentence

138
00:10:51.66 --> 00:10:56.30
Perhaps we could have just quoted Sunsu in that one, but it's good to show some different angles

139
00:10:56.30 --> 00:10:58.54
What why are they doing that well because it's worldview?

140
00:10:59.42 --> 00:11:03.58
It's decision making it's understanding trying to show some things that you need to understand

141
00:11:03.58 --> 00:11:05.58
Because Sunsu just said no your enemy

142
00:11:06.14 --> 00:11:08.14
Boom done, we're done

143
00:11:08.62 --> 00:11:10.62
Here's some details

144
00:11:12.22 --> 00:11:14.22
First section is called the test

145
00:11:14.54 --> 00:11:20.70
This chapter explores how political actors who view themselves as rivals to the United States and its allies approach competition

146
00:11:20.70 --> 00:11:28.14
Usually this means states with an authoritarian government or non-state actors who are described to an extremist ideology

147
00:11:28.14 --> 00:11:30.14
In

148
00:11:33.50 --> 00:11:35.50
Leadership strategy and tactics

149
00:11:36.06 --> 00:11:40.86
There's one section where it's on page 157 and 158 where I talk about what a

150
00:11:42.38 --> 00:11:46.86
Good leader in a new new leader stepping into leadership role and it actually ends up just applying to all leaders

151
00:11:46.86 --> 00:11:54.78
But one of the things I say in there is be balanced extreme opinions and actions are usually bad and what's interesting about this

152
00:11:56.86 --> 00:11:58.06
America

153
00:11:58.06 --> 00:12:00.06
The way America is supposed to be

154
00:12:01.26 --> 00:12:11.18
Is balanced that's the way it's supposed to be and you'll notice that when when they're talking about who the rivals of America are it's talking about a authoritarian government

155
00:12:11.18 --> 00:12:13.18
That's an extreme

156
00:12:13.18 --> 00:12:15.18
or non-state actors that are

157
00:12:15.18 --> 00:12:17.18
Subscribe to an extreme ideology

158
00:12:17.18 --> 00:12:19.18
So just to clue

159
00:12:19.74 --> 00:12:23.02
When we're thinking about our country about America

160
00:12:23.02 --> 00:12:30.62
We are trying to have balance. We're trying to not be extreme. That's not a good thing

161
00:12:32.14 --> 00:12:34.30
We're trying to arrivals are extreme

162
00:12:37.82 --> 00:12:44.06
Continuing we label these actors arrivals because they either use competitive methods that run counterdo accepted international norms

163
00:12:44.06 --> 00:12:48.46
Or they pursue in-rests that clash with those the United States and its allies frequently they do both

164
00:12:48.46 --> 00:12:56.62
Truly understanding how our potential rivals approach competition requires serious reflection and critical thinking

165
00:12:56.62 --> 00:13:02.06
Once again, Marine Corps telling us to be reflective and tell us telling us to apply critical thinking

166
00:13:03.74 --> 00:13:05.74
We didn't hear

167
00:13:05.74 --> 00:13:07.74
We didn't hear any

168
00:13:07.74 --> 00:13:20.14
Talk of serious reflection and critical thinking from gunnery sergeant Hartman in the first 45 minutes of full metal jacket

169
00:13:20.14 --> 00:13:23.82
In fact, it will be nearly impossible for Marines to

170
00:13:24.46 --> 00:13:31.82
To see beyond their own patterns of thought the patterns they develop from living in an American society and serving in an organization like the Marine Corps

171
00:13:31.82 --> 00:13:36.22
So you have to break out of that box that you're in

172
00:13:38.86 --> 00:13:43.98
However, those who do this kind of intellectual work which is a strong word work

173
00:13:45.02 --> 00:13:50.54
Give themselves the opportunity as discussed in-chaperitude to create a model representing rival approaches to competition

174
00:13:51.26 --> 00:13:52.78
Okay

175
00:13:52.78 --> 00:14:01.26
For people like Marines who carry 100 pound rucksacks up and down a hill who hump machine guns who come over the beach

176
00:14:01.98 --> 00:14:05.82
Who dig in to foxholes to use the word work

177
00:14:07.10 --> 00:14:08.94
To describe

178
00:14:08.94 --> 00:14:13.82
How we're gonna think about things that's a that's an important thing to know this is not easy

179
00:14:14.86 --> 00:14:16.86
It's not easy

180
00:14:17.26 --> 00:14:20.22
And I'm gonna give everyone a little hint here myself included

181
00:14:20.22 --> 00:14:24.30
You know how you know you know how you can do intellectual work

182
00:14:25.50 --> 00:14:30.30
Echo you're gonna guess us how did you do intellectual work how do you think about something what does that what does that look like

183
00:14:31.34 --> 00:14:34.78
Me yeah echo Charles how do I do intellectual work

184
00:14:37.18 --> 00:14:39.18
So if you

185
00:14:40.14 --> 00:14:46.06
Read about something or listen okay, okay, okay, somebody people talk or whatever

186
00:14:46.06 --> 00:14:50.94
And then try to think of other examples outside of their specific context

187
00:14:51.34 --> 00:14:53.34
Okay, excellent. I like this answer

188
00:14:53.66 --> 00:14:58.86
That's a first one they came to mind. I do that all the time. I'll obviously you sit here and do that with me all the time because we're sitting here

189
00:14:59.58 --> 00:15:05.90
Reading books and talking about the context of that book and then what it looks like from different angles

190
00:15:06.78 --> 00:15:10.38
We study the same material from war over and over again

191
00:15:10.38 --> 00:15:16.70
And should look at it from a different angle so the whole idea of trying to and again

192
00:15:17.26 --> 00:15:23.58
We talked about this before but yes my one of my biggest take no straight up my big stick away from his whole thing campaign whatever

193
00:15:25.34 --> 00:15:28.62
Is recognizing that there's a short game in playing long game in play

194
00:15:30.54 --> 00:15:37.42
So to be able to see the long game in every little move you do that takes work. That's a good exercise. We'll see for the work

195
00:15:37.42 --> 00:15:43.98
Okay, I like where you're at you brought us closer to my answer

196
00:15:46.38 --> 00:15:51.50
Dave Burke any additional information yeah, I mean the thing I would add is

197
00:15:52.14 --> 00:15:57.42
When I listen to other people talk or read or hear or whatever that is and it's certainly a habit that I've

198
00:15:58.14 --> 00:15:59.34
Picked up

199
00:15:59.34 --> 00:16:05.02
Haven't always had this habit so when I'm the beginning of my reading life is just trying to figure out why people

200
00:16:05.02 --> 00:16:08.06
Think what they think like why do they see it that way and

201
00:16:09.02 --> 00:16:11.58
Not for the sake of finding out what's wrong with them

202
00:16:12.22 --> 00:16:18.46
But by actually wondering if there seems something and I'm not seeing like why does this guy see the same problem the same

203
00:16:18.62 --> 00:16:21.22
Problem that I think I'm looking at and see it so differently and

204
00:16:22.34 --> 00:16:25.34
What does he see that I don't see and

205
00:16:25.98 --> 00:16:33.10
a lot of where that thought came in is it my time in the military is when I started flying up atop gun was a first time when we really got

206
00:16:33.10 --> 00:16:35.10
Invested in our adversary capability

207
00:16:35.98 --> 00:16:40.06
So we always knew what our threats can do with it's kind of pretty binary pretty linear

208
00:16:40.06 --> 00:16:42.30
They can do this they can do that we can do this me that this problem

209
00:16:42.30 --> 00:16:46.06
You know get solved by when you shoot a missile where you maneuver things like that when I went up to top

210
00:16:46.06 --> 00:16:52.14
Gonna became the adversary officer which mean my job for about a year was to pretend to be a Russian pilot basically

211
00:16:52.54 --> 00:17:00.86
They'll plans build tactics do things and my what I was supposed to see the world through their eyes and that actually helped me learn that when I see what they're doing or other people are thinking or saying is

212
00:17:00.86 --> 00:17:07.58
Why are they seeing the same thing differently and that to me leads to what are they trying to accomplish

213
00:17:08.78 --> 00:17:14.62
One more example, which I think is important though that's the lyrics and I bring it up is the the ability to

214
00:17:15.98 --> 00:17:20.06
Separate your feelings from your behavior because usually like if you're just not doing any

215
00:17:20.54 --> 00:17:22.54
Mental work or whatever

216
00:17:22.54 --> 00:17:26.14
Whatever you feel you're gonna your behavior is gonna reflect that specifically

217
00:17:26.14 --> 00:17:33.02
Say that doesn't take much work, but if you're and the more intense the feeling the harder work it's gonna be to

218
00:17:33.58 --> 00:17:37.42
Change your behavior so it's not based on those emotions feelings whatever

219
00:17:37.42 --> 00:17:41.74
So when you can separate those two that's work. Wait. What are we separating? How you feel and how you behave?

220
00:17:41.74 --> 00:17:45.42
Okay, got it. So you know when you get angry you don't have to act angry like that's hard

221
00:17:45.42 --> 00:17:49.42
That's work right there for mental work. Yeah, yeah, so

222
00:17:50.70 --> 00:17:55.02
There's one there's one more thing that I would add to these ideas so we have read

223
00:17:55.02 --> 00:18:02.46
Which I definitely like then we're gonna read we're gonna question both you kind of said the same thing like hey we're gonna question

224
00:18:03.74 --> 00:18:05.26
Why is that like that?

225
00:18:05.26 --> 00:18:10.30
Maybe it's a little overlay of my thoughts or feelings about that or my experiences around that

226
00:18:11.42 --> 00:18:13.42
And then what I would say

227
00:18:14.38 --> 00:18:16.38
intellectual work kind of requires

228
00:18:18.54 --> 00:18:21.74
Is to write is to actually write down

229
00:18:21.74 --> 00:18:29.42
What what you're what you're what you're where you're going and one of the most powerful things about writing things down

230
00:18:29.42 --> 00:18:32.62
And this is another thing I said on the F online today writing things down

231
00:18:33.66 --> 00:18:38.78
Is defacto detaching from it. Yep, so if I if Dave's having a hard time making a decision

232
00:18:39.18 --> 00:18:43.82
And I could tell him hey you need to do catch or I can say hey make a pros and cons list

233
00:18:44.30 --> 00:18:46.30
He makes a pros and cons now he's

234
00:18:46.30 --> 00:18:49.50
Literally comes out of his head onto a piece of paper and he's looking at it

235
00:18:49.50 --> 00:18:55.10
Yeah, it's actual detachment the only way I can write a cons list of my own plan is to be detached from that plan

236
00:18:55.10 --> 00:18:59.58
Yeah, I can come up with what's wrong with it is to detach from it. Yeah, totally

237
00:19:00.38 --> 00:19:03.42
So if you're out there and you're thinking okay, I want to do some intellectual work

238
00:19:04.14 --> 00:19:06.14
What what you should do is read

239
00:19:06.94 --> 00:19:13.10
You should question and you should write down what you think because when you're trying to write down what you think

240
00:19:13.10 --> 00:19:15.10
It detaches you from the problem

241
00:19:15.10 --> 00:19:22.86
Even if you're trying to write down even if Dave hands me, you know 20 pages of his concept about how rushons fly

242
00:19:23.18 --> 00:19:29.66
What I should do is go oh, thanks Dave. I should read it and I should actually write down hey I think these were the major points that you hit

243
00:19:30.70 --> 00:19:36.30
And now I'm now I'm seeing what I'm understanding and I'm looking at it and I go oh wait

244
00:19:36.30 --> 00:19:38.70
He also said this oh wait. There's a hole over here

245
00:19:38.70 --> 00:19:44.06
Dave didn't see this really super obvious thing that any idiot want to see him. I'm scared

246
00:19:45.58 --> 00:19:48.38
But it but it allows me to look at it from a detached perspective

247
00:19:48.70 --> 00:19:54.54
So even when you're when you're even if you read something even if somebody explained something to you to capture those things

248
00:19:54.54 --> 00:20:01.02
You know even when you take notes taking notes is part of it taking notes is part of learning

249
00:20:01.02 --> 00:20:09.58
In in way the warrior kid you can't just buy flashcards with math with math problems with the times table

250
00:20:09.58 --> 00:20:16.14
You can't just buy flashcards and you need to make them you need to write them yourself that's part of it. That's part of the learning process

251
00:20:21.98 --> 00:20:28.22
Continues on here we return to the Udalupe to develop our understanding of why others approach competition differently and

252
00:20:28.22 --> 00:20:36.46
What the implications might be we accept that the that Udha is more than a linear process a person's orientation

253
00:20:37.10 --> 00:20:40.30
Interacts dynamically with the other three elements of the Udalupe

254
00:20:41.02 --> 00:20:46.30
Below we examine how arrivals orientation may be different from ours and then how

255
00:20:47.26 --> 00:20:53.26
And then look at how to use this knowledge to build our understanding of rival approaches to competition

256
00:20:53.26 --> 00:20:57.50
So we're just going deep in a Dave Burke world

257
00:20:59.10 --> 00:21:04.38
How much did you guys focus on the Udalupe at like at top gone we we talk about it's embedded in there

258
00:21:04.78 --> 00:21:10.94
It's funny because I talk I teach I guess you could say I teach a version of the Udalupe now especially the mustard

259
00:21:10.94 --> 00:21:15.50
My connection to the Udalupe is much more aligned with the principles of a shameless ship

260
00:21:15.50 --> 00:21:19.66
We talk about prioritizing execute observe or in-designed is relax look around make it call

261
00:21:19.66 --> 00:21:24.06
So I make kind of a narrow connection and and the way I teach it is is narrow by design

262
00:21:24.06 --> 00:21:26.70
Well, it's a 25 minute class. I'm not gonna spend hours on this thing

263
00:21:27.42 --> 00:21:31.34
And one of the things that I focus on is the action the a part of the loop

264
00:21:31.74 --> 00:21:36.86
But when this you know the inception of the thing when boy talked about it and if you read boy's description of the loop

265
00:21:37.10 --> 00:21:41.66
He talks about orientation and basically says that's the most important part

266
00:21:41.90 --> 00:21:47.58
That's the most critical step and underneath that was his recognition of how hard it is to do what you just described

267
00:21:47.58 --> 00:21:54.30
Jockel how hard it is from it. Go all right. Let me get out of my own head my own eyes my own vision of this and see it from another

268
00:21:54.54 --> 00:22:01.10
Persons perspective how hard it is to detach and so as we're talking Udaluen the orientation piece he

269
00:22:01.50 --> 00:22:03.50
Emphasize that so much

270
00:22:04.14 --> 00:22:11.10
Because I think he understood it's so difficult to detach and go what are you seeing how are you seeing this differently?

271
00:22:11.34 --> 00:22:14.46
Certainly, you know great power competition you could go down to an airplane

272
00:22:14.46 --> 00:22:20.62
But that orientation process is really difficult to do and that was one of the things we talked about all the time is

273
00:22:21.18 --> 00:22:25.26
We would teach from one perspective and fly from another so if it's a top-grin instructor

274
00:22:25.26 --> 00:22:27.26
I would go teach you

275
00:22:27.90 --> 00:22:30.54
Offensive BFM and I would fly

276
00:22:31.10 --> 00:22:34.82
Defense sorry sorry that's dog fighting one against one basic fighter maneuvers

277
00:22:34.82 --> 00:22:41.82
So the whole class I would give you before you and I go fly I'm teaching you how to be behind me offensive and then I would fly the flight as the instructor

278
00:22:41.82 --> 00:22:46.62
The opposite side you're trying to be behind me. No, no, no, I am you're behind me

279
00:22:46.62 --> 00:22:51.42
It's designed to be that since it's it's you to get that picture, but the instructor has to be able to have the vision

280
00:22:51.98 --> 00:22:53.98
Looking over looking behind me

281
00:22:53.98 --> 00:22:57.82
But seeing it as if I'm behind you the ability to have your orientation

282
00:22:57.90 --> 00:23:01.34
So if I'm gonna be a good if I'm gonna be a qualified top-grin instructor

283
00:23:01.34 --> 00:23:05.18
I have to teach you how to fly offensive meaning you're behind me

284
00:23:05.18 --> 00:23:07.74
I had to fly that whole flight defensive

285
00:23:07.74 --> 00:23:12.62
But be able to explain what happened from your perspective from your point of view that's what makes it so hard

286
00:23:12.70 --> 00:23:17.58
That's the orientation because in that fight the way it is is your behind me and I'm defensive

287
00:23:17.58 --> 00:23:23.10
But when I'm actually teaching is I'm behind you and offensive and it's really hard to do that

288
00:23:25.18 --> 00:23:30.62
So this this idea here is important because now we're not just talking about orient

289
00:23:30.62 --> 00:23:37.50
In myself, it's what's your orientation what's my rivals orientations and that's that's a

290
00:23:38.46 --> 00:23:42.94
Radically different ball game and it's it's funny because I always use the turn perspective right?

291
00:23:42.94 --> 00:23:49.10
I don't know what my enemy's perspective or or what my you know what my coworkers perspective is what how are they oriented towards this problem?

292
00:23:49.10 --> 00:23:50.78
What's their perspective on this?

293
00:23:50.94 --> 00:23:54.14
So this is something that I talk about all the time, but I haven't connected that

294
00:23:54.14 --> 00:23:59.82
What we're really doing is we're seeing the u their u to loop what does it look like for them?

295
00:24:03.18 --> 00:24:09.58
Orientations affects on the u to loop or orientation influences all other elements of the u to loop because it controls

296
00:24:09.90 --> 00:24:15.74
Because it controls how people make sense of what they observe and because it shapes their decisions and actions

297
00:24:16.86 --> 00:24:22.46
Orientation consists of all things that affect how a person understands the world such as language culture genetics

298
00:24:22.46 --> 00:24:29.82
Education, previous experience, et cetera humans often use mental shortcuts called

299
00:24:30.22 --> 00:24:32.94
Euristics which we talked about on the cognitive bias

300
00:24:33.66 --> 00:24:38.14
Program on the on the underground they developed four orientation now

301
00:24:38.78 --> 00:24:40.78
This is another crazy

302
00:24:41.18 --> 00:24:43.18
web of connection

303
00:24:43.82 --> 00:24:47.42
When when and I've been going off on this when Darrell Cooper and I did

304
00:24:47.42 --> 00:24:53.82
One of the unraveling podcasts and I talk about we talked about what is your story and this whole thing and you take that

305
00:24:53.82 --> 00:24:56.46
What is your story and then you apply it to leadership and you apply it to life?

306
00:24:56.46 --> 00:24:58.46
That's exactly what this is

307
00:24:58.86 --> 00:25:05.18
Understanding the person story understanding the rival story understanding the enemy story understanding your competitor story

308
00:25:05.50 --> 00:25:11.42
And also understanding your co-workers story understanding your subordinate story understanding your superior story

309
00:25:11.58 --> 00:25:13.58
Understanding your peer story

310
00:25:13.58 --> 00:25:18.22
All those things are playing into how they are oriented in this situation

311
00:25:20.06 --> 00:25:25.10
So I'm gonna throw this out to just a little just a little something for you

312
00:25:26.86 --> 00:25:28.86
If I'm having trouble with Dave

313
00:25:29.74 --> 00:25:31.74
If I'm having trouble with Dave as

314
00:25:32.38 --> 00:25:34.38
He's my subordinate or he's my peer

315
00:25:34.94 --> 00:25:41.74
You know what's a good little drill is to sit down and write out what is Dave's perspective

316
00:25:41.74 --> 00:25:46.94
Because now I'm gonna detach now. I'm gonna take a step back now

317
00:25:46.94 --> 00:25:53.50
I'm gonna have to actually do the intellectual work because I can do a little with the old Dave's problem is that's cool

318
00:25:53.50 --> 00:26:02.38
But that's not intellectual work that's intellectual doodling and I'm pointing at echo Charles when I say that because echo Charles has a tendency to doodle sometimes during this podcast

319
00:26:03.58 --> 00:26:06.62
Intellectual doodling is oh, it would Dave's problem is

320
00:26:06.62 --> 00:26:11.34
Intellectual work is you know what I need to sit down and write down

321
00:26:11.50 --> 00:26:17.10
What is Dave's perspective? Why does he care about this project? Why is he so concerned about the timeline?

322
00:26:17.66 --> 00:26:23.50
Why is he need say he needs more people when he's never asked for those are really good questions if I answer those questions

323
00:26:23.50 --> 00:26:25.10
And do the intellectual work?

324
00:26:25.10 --> 00:26:38.06
I will actually make progress and undo a better job of understanding what his perspective is and how he's oriented in this situation for example back to the book

325
00:26:38.30 --> 00:26:42.62
When people learn to drive a car they gain experience and making a right turn at first they consciously look through

326
00:26:42.94 --> 00:26:44.94
Think through each step

327
00:26:44.94 --> 00:26:50.14
Such as engaging the turn signal looking in their mirrors for other traffic tapping the brake pedal turn the wheel

328
00:26:50.14 --> 00:26:54.46
And a relatively short time this experience becomes a mental shortcut so that when a driver

329
00:26:55.02 --> 00:27:01.34
Recognizes a pattern their brain knows as right turn they automatically go through the steps and making the right turn a little known need for conscious thought about it

330
00:27:01.90 --> 00:27:03.10
Apply that mental

331
00:27:03.10 --> 00:27:09.34
A similar type of mental shortcut also happens with great frequency often in more complex or dangerous situations

332
00:27:10.22 --> 00:27:13.82
So we're not thinking or we're we're taking shortcuts mental shortcuts

333
00:27:14.94 --> 00:27:16.94
What do you got Dave?

334
00:27:16.94 --> 00:27:18.94
Be careful man. We might not get through this one

335
00:27:18.94 --> 00:27:27.58
I'm sorry to freak out. Yeah, but this is there's so much in your you said this I think on the last podcast was this I know this publications about competing with

336
00:27:28.30 --> 00:27:34.30
Our global rivals here, but this doesn't have to be about a competitor all the time a competitor all the time it can

337
00:27:34.86 --> 00:27:39.98
It can be the people on your team hundred percent people that you're trying to help and and I think the way you're describing it is is

338
00:27:40.62 --> 00:27:44.78
I mean that's leadership at its core and I was just thinking of how what did they manage that you have?

339
00:27:44.78 --> 00:27:50.86
If you can understand from their perspective why they're doing what they're doing and of course that helps with your competition

340
00:27:50.86 --> 00:27:55.34
If you know why that chess player is moving the pieces the way it is that's a huge advantage

341
00:27:55.58 --> 00:27:58.14
But think about how you can help your people and

342
00:27:58.30 --> 00:28:01.90
This is just the idea that this understanding of their perspective

343
00:28:02.70 --> 00:28:04.70
the leadership

344
00:28:05.74 --> 00:28:07.74
Power that you have

345
00:28:07.74 --> 00:28:09.74
to understand that

346
00:28:09.74 --> 00:28:16.30
And the impact you can have to help them make good decisions or help them get to what they want to get or accomplish with they want to accomplish

347
00:28:16.30 --> 00:28:21.34
By understanding their perspective and you use example all the time we talk about kids and and

348
00:28:22.22 --> 00:28:28.94
That's actually one thing we can do is I remember what it's like to be the my 12 year old daughter and the thing and it's easy to dismiss it and be like

349
00:28:29.98 --> 00:28:34.14
Get annoyed with them for behaving or acting or reacting to a situation a certain way and let you go

350
00:28:34.14 --> 00:28:41.98
Aw, you know what I actually remember what that feels like to be in her situation. I know where she's coming from I know why she sees this thing as such a huge deal

351
00:28:42.62 --> 00:28:48.62
And if I take that perspective that orientation it's so much easier for me to guide her to where I want her to be to help her

352
00:28:48.62 --> 00:28:51.18
Not as a competitor, but someone I actually want to help

353
00:28:51.66 --> 00:28:56.78
So just the connection between the orientation the competition in the next piece is actually to lead them

354
00:28:56.78 --> 00:29:03.90
The the that saying hey don't forget don't forget where you came from like when I became an officer in the sealed teams

355
00:29:03.90 --> 00:29:07.50
You know, don't forget where you came from man. That's a real thing

356
00:29:08.46 --> 00:29:11.34
That's a real thing and you don't want to forget where you came from

357
00:29:11.66 --> 00:29:14.46
What is the thing that you don't want to forget you don't want to forget that perspective?

358
00:29:14.46 --> 00:29:19.42
I wrote about leadership strategy tactics. I remembered being the last guy on a patrol no idea where we're going

359
00:29:19.42 --> 00:29:21.42
No idea how much further we have to

360
00:29:21.58 --> 00:29:25.82
Go until we get there no idea what we're gonna do to break no idea if there's any streams up ahead

361
00:29:25.82 --> 00:29:28.38
We can get water no I don't know anything and I hated it and

362
00:29:29.34 --> 00:29:33.58
When I was in charge I remember I didn't forget where I came from I didn't forget what it was

363
00:29:33.58 --> 00:29:38.14
I didn't forget the perspective of being an AW in the back of the train

364
00:29:39.26 --> 00:29:42.38
So it's like the opposite of the curse of knowledge remember that

365
00:29:42.86 --> 00:29:47.42
Cognitive bias across the knowledge when you kind of forget that you know everything and everyone else doesn't right

366
00:29:47.42 --> 00:29:50.22
It's the opposite of that. I wouldn't know she's the opposite of that

367
00:29:50.70 --> 00:29:53.74
It's a similar thing where I think everybody knows what I know

368
00:29:53.74 --> 00:30:01.02
And in this case don't forget yeah, I guess it is I guess it is you could utilize that cognitive bias as a warning

369
00:30:01.02 --> 00:30:03.02
Hey make sure that everybody

370
00:30:03.02 --> 00:30:05.02
Not everybody knows what you know

371
00:30:06.94 --> 00:30:14.94
Continue on it is essential for Marines to understand the role a person's orientation plays in the choices they make and how this relates to the actions

372
00:30:14.94 --> 00:30:22.22
They take in the world this also applies to groups of people where a kind of collective orientation can work in a similar way

373
00:30:22.22 --> 00:30:23.58
Oh wow

374
00:30:23.58 --> 00:30:29.98
If everyone on the team sees something the same way it's gonna be a better it's gonna be an easier team believe and they're gonna get more stuff done

375
00:30:29.98 --> 00:30:31.98
They're gonna get it done quicker

376
00:30:33.82 --> 00:30:35.18
Yeah, the

377
00:30:35.18 --> 00:30:42.78
Now that when you said all the earlier podcast the whole reason that I was so fired up for this podcast is because it's not just about competing

378
00:30:42.78 --> 00:30:45.02
It's more it's equally about leadership

379
00:30:46.62 --> 00:30:49.10
But my note on the cover of this says

380
00:30:49.10 --> 00:30:52.30
uh competing and then or influencing

381
00:30:53.42 --> 00:30:55.42
Which is leadership

382
00:30:56.62 --> 00:30:58.62
this

383
00:30:59.66 --> 00:31:05.90
This also applies to groups of people where a kind of collective orientation can work in a similar way

384
00:31:05.90 --> 00:31:12.70
We must constantly study the components of a rivals orientation if our understanding of their approach to competition is to be useful

385
00:31:12.70 --> 00:31:14.70
useful in crafting our own campaign

386
00:31:14.70 --> 00:31:23.58
Keep in mind that two people can look at a set of facts and come to very different conclusions about what these facts mean

387
00:31:24.14 --> 00:31:29.98
This applies to groups of people as well as we learn in chapter two narratives narratives stories narratives are what

388
00:31:30.62 --> 00:31:39.26
People use to give meaning to facts isn't that an interesting way of saying it a narrative in this sense is the story that explains how the world works

389
00:31:39.26 --> 00:31:46.86
This narrative or stories constructed from the components language culture experience found in orientation thus

390
00:31:47.42 --> 00:31:55.18
People make sense of the world based on their orientation and again the the podcast that that darele and I did on this

391
00:31:57.10 --> 00:31:59.82
Called what is your story on the on the unraveling podcast

392
00:32:00.46 --> 00:32:07.58
The way that the mind works to formulate stories so that you can survive and make sense of the world

393
00:32:07.58 --> 00:32:13.82
There's always we cover them on the podcast, but these psychological experiments that that psychologists have done

394
00:32:14.54 --> 00:32:16.54
That show clearly that

395
00:32:17.66 --> 00:32:20.78
We will connect the dots in our own head and just believe that to be the truth

396
00:32:21.02 --> 00:32:26.06
We will we will make up a story it's the extreme of you know in leadership strategy in tactics of um

397
00:32:26.38 --> 00:32:31.02
Hey, if you know if you if you don't tell the team what's going on they're gonna make up a story and it's not gonna be a good one by the way

398
00:32:32.54 --> 00:32:34.22
That's what we do so we do in groups

399
00:32:34.22 --> 00:32:39.82
We'll fill in the blanks all day long. You're if you're in a seal platoon and you don't know where you're going

400
00:32:40.38 --> 00:32:48.94
Believe me guess where you're going you're going to to Siberia for a six month deployment. That's what's happening

401
00:32:51.98 --> 00:32:55.58
And then you know I got fired up with a title of this next section

402
00:32:56.38 --> 00:32:59.10
Language shapes behavior

403
00:32:59.10 --> 00:33:03.42
Hmm, and that interesting there are 1984 George or well

404
00:33:04.38 --> 00:33:06.38
Which some people have commented echo Charles

405
00:33:07.58 --> 00:33:10.38
That you didn't read that book in high school. No

406
00:33:11.50 --> 00:33:13.50
Scary

407
00:33:13.74 --> 00:33:20.78
We think it's scary. I don't even know if it was because they didn't assign it or because I refused to read it after it was assigned

408
00:33:21.26 --> 00:33:27.42
Refused or or failed to okay just wanted to make sure I have that language that we were using

409
00:33:27.42 --> 00:33:30.86
What's gonna shape our real murder correct? I don't read it

410
00:33:33.58 --> 00:33:36.06
We didn't have that but I don't think we have that book check

411
00:33:36.94 --> 00:33:38.94
It's a hard book to get I mean it's

412
00:33:39.98 --> 00:33:46.62
No, I'm okay people use words to describe things around the world around them and to describe what is happening in the world

413
00:33:47.34 --> 00:33:52.78
These words influence their actions language affects groups of people in a similar way as the words they choose

414
00:33:52.78 --> 00:34:00.06
Provide the meaning they want to communicate to each other the words they choose provide the meaning

415
00:34:00.06 --> 00:34:04.94
They want to communicate to each other the meaning that is understood then calls it the group to act in one way or another

416
00:34:06.06 --> 00:34:08.78
Note that this applies to the word competition

417
00:34:09.74 --> 00:34:16.62
In the Western world the word has various meanings that bring to mind sporting events or perhaps two businesses trying to win market share

418
00:34:16.62 --> 00:34:24.54
When we add descriptors to the word like great power competition or nation state competition the context

419
00:34:25.18 --> 00:34:30.14
The descriptors provide a just our understanding of the competition we face

420
00:34:31.50 --> 00:34:33.50
Have you ever heard that

421
00:34:34.46 --> 00:34:37.50
The Eskimos have a hundred different words for snow

422
00:34:39.02 --> 00:34:40.30
Fact or fiction

423
00:34:40.30 --> 00:34:45.66
Were you at I don't know oh the fact that they have a hundred different words hundreds one hundred

424
00:34:45.66 --> 00:34:47.66
I don't think that that's true Dave

425
00:34:48.94 --> 00:34:52.38
Fact or fiction I'm gonna say it's not true. It's probably just a saying

426
00:34:52.94 --> 00:34:59.50
Okay, but it probably is rooted something yeah, maybe there's a lot more than just one word you know like 14 words or something like this

427
00:34:59.50 --> 00:35:02.86
I don't know how many words it's probably I'm this is really dumb of me to do this

428
00:35:02.86 --> 00:35:04.86
I like did research and did write it down

429
00:35:04.86 --> 00:35:09.26
I think the number is the round 50 there's around 50 words and

430
00:35:09.26 --> 00:35:17.66
But but it's words for like frost versus snow on the ground versus snow in the air versus hard packs snow versus soft powders

431
00:35:17.66 --> 00:35:19.66
No, they they do have different words

432
00:35:20.54 --> 00:35:27.02
Yeah, remember I was telling you in in Hawaiian there's different words for water for that exact same reason this ocean water

433
00:35:27.26 --> 00:35:29.74
There's river water there's a rain that you know

434
00:35:30.54 --> 00:35:32.54
Different words yeah, and those are really actually

435
00:35:33.34 --> 00:35:37.90
Very different things you I mean, let's face it those are really different things why don't we have what what?

436
00:35:37.90 --> 00:35:40.94
I guess we have a descriptor ocean water. River water lake water

437
00:35:41.34 --> 00:35:46.86
Yeah, well why some things need the descriptor and one things kind of need a whole different word, you know

438
00:35:47.02 --> 00:35:49.02
What's the differentiator really?

439
00:35:49.58 --> 00:35:50.54
I don't know

440
00:35:50.54 --> 00:35:51.34
Mr.

441
00:35:51.34 --> 00:35:53.02
Hey look if you're gonna be like

442
00:35:54.94 --> 00:36:02.06
If you're gonna be like hey rain water river water lake water waterfall ocean water wave these are all things may

443
00:36:02.06 --> 00:36:05.34
Had that have water in right right why not just go go deeper go oxygen

444
00:36:05.50 --> 00:36:07.02
There's oxygen in all these other things

445
00:36:07.02 --> 00:36:13.50
I was I was trying to think of an example of like well what words actually are like that here's one road

446
00:36:14.70 --> 00:36:17.34
We have a road totally we have a highway

447
00:36:18.54 --> 00:36:20.54
We have an exit

448
00:36:21.42 --> 00:36:27.10
We have what I can say okay, that's three words well then then the street street

449
00:36:27.10 --> 00:36:30.38
Okay, good yes, thank you. There's a bunch more and and the

450
00:36:31.02 --> 00:36:36.06
Connection dude is like your ass is like it's about I think it's about perspective and the orientation of it

451
00:36:36.06 --> 00:36:39.10
Oh, by the way like I was thinking of we said snow is like well

452
00:36:40.38 --> 00:36:48.62
If it's is it I don't know is it is it a dusting or is it like a dumping like the perspective that actually really matters like what would you go do and what road?

453
00:36:48.62 --> 00:36:53.42
I don't know is it a like unpaved single lane, you know dirt hard

454
00:36:53.98 --> 00:36:56.78
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's right. Hey, and if you're gonna go on one of those crazy

455
00:36:56.78 --> 00:36:58.78
I X is it like what kind of road is it?

456
00:36:59.66 --> 00:37:04.14
And that's the word he's described is gonna matter a lot based on under perspective on that

457
00:37:04.14 --> 00:37:06.14
Yeah, oh

458
00:37:07.50 --> 00:37:11.58
Stop it where's the line you know where do you draw the line but yeah, you're right

459
00:37:14.22 --> 00:37:16.86
Compare the Western use of the word competition to words

460
00:37:17.58 --> 00:37:22.78
Offeritarian governments use to label the same relationship the contrast helps us see

461
00:37:23.50 --> 00:37:28.46
How language might shape behavior for example some rivals use struggle or

462
00:37:29.98 --> 00:37:31.98
Embracing while fighting

463
00:37:31.98 --> 00:37:36.70
Which is a pretty cool thing we call that jujitsu by the way

464
00:37:37.50 --> 00:37:46.22
Embracing or fighting to name what we know is competition to most Marines hearing something described as struggle or fighting would shape an initial reaction

465
00:37:46.54 --> 00:37:49.34
Quite a bit different than if we had heard described as competition

466
00:37:50.38 --> 00:37:56.62
Because of the mental shortcuts to built into how we learned to use the words and what our experience tells us those words typically mean

467
00:37:57.02 --> 00:38:00.14
This should alert us that we need to employ critical thinking

468
00:38:00.14 --> 00:38:09.82
When considering the language our competitors use it can and does cause them to approach the situation from a different perspective

469
00:38:10.38 --> 00:38:13.66
Which leads them to consider using different tools than we might choose

470
00:38:15.98 --> 00:38:17.98
That's just

471
00:38:18.86 --> 00:38:24.06
If you don't think through that right there you're just gonna fall short if you don't think about how your

472
00:38:24.70 --> 00:38:26.70
competitor or what more important

473
00:38:26.70 --> 00:38:32.22
What is your what is your subordinate how what words are they choosing

474
00:38:33.42 --> 00:38:35.42
Wait

475
00:38:35.82 --> 00:38:37.82
I'm getting oh I'm in charge of this

476
00:38:39.02 --> 00:38:41.66
Oh, I'm in charge hey echo hey, I want you to take charge of this

477
00:38:42.78 --> 00:38:46.86
And then I hear echo in the locker room go yeah jocco tasked me with oh

478
00:38:47.42 --> 00:38:53.42
You're seeing as opposed to like yeah, I'll be running this now. Oh, yeah, yeah, we're saying the exact same thing totally

479
00:38:53.42 --> 00:38:59.90
They're meaning yeah one echo is happy about hey, I'm gonna run in this now and one is hey jocco tasked me with doing this

480
00:38:59.90 --> 00:39:05.10
Of course, I'm showing some tone on there. I guess yeah, but that's she though like if you know if you tell me

481
00:39:05.66 --> 00:39:07.18
Hey, you're in charge of

482
00:39:07.18 --> 00:39:09.18
Mowing the lawn

483
00:39:09.50 --> 00:39:13.90
Okay, you know, I take some respawn you know that's the feeling you know, but if you be like hey

484
00:39:14.38 --> 00:39:20.14
You got to go do some chores and and one of them is going that that's your problem

485
00:39:20.14 --> 00:39:25.34
Hubbed that knowing the lawn that's your problem now kind of got to want to do it you you're gonna do it both

486
00:39:25.90 --> 00:39:27.90
situations I got to do it

487
00:39:27.90 --> 00:39:29.90
Same deal

488
00:39:29.90 --> 00:39:36.62
Different attitude though different approaches if I understand the approach if I understand that the words that I use or when I ask you about it

489
00:39:37.26 --> 00:39:43.70
And I understand that those words reveal the situation clear for me as a leader to make decisions

490
00:39:43.70 --> 00:39:47.50
That's a powerful thing and of course it applies to a competition as well

491
00:39:47.50 --> 00:39:55.50
The words people picked to describe things can also reveal biases or tendencies which is what I just said and these things can be exploited

492
00:39:55.82 --> 00:40:03.58
Our competitors across the globe recognize Western societies tendency to think of themselves as either in a condition of at-piece or at-war

493
00:40:05.34 --> 00:40:08.54
This is a significant contrast from Maltzay Duns

494
00:40:08.54 --> 00:40:16.62
Political politics is war without bloodshed while war is politics with with bloodshed Maltzay's the word war

495
00:40:17.98 --> 00:40:23.82
He chose the word war to describe the enduring relationship between political actors and an essence said that while

496
00:40:24.38 --> 00:40:28.38
The relationship is violent some of the time it's always at a state of war

497
00:40:30.70 --> 00:40:37.42
Marines must consider how using words like these differs from how the United States describes it and the corresponding impact these

498
00:40:37.42 --> 00:40:41.98
differences might have on the ways and means arrival might use in competition

499
00:40:48.14 --> 00:40:51.82
Man they're think you're thinking we're in competition they're thinking we're at war

500
00:40:56.14 --> 00:41:02.46
The culture of a group can be defined as the groups accumulated shared learning of how to solve internal and external problems

501
00:41:02.46 --> 00:41:10.62
The group this is culture by the way, I miss that the title of this is culture the culture of a group can be defined as the group's accumulated shared learning of how to solve

502
00:41:10.86 --> 00:41:12.86
Internal and external problems

503
00:41:12.86 --> 00:41:20.54
The group then determines that this shared learning is valid so the new members learn it as they as the correct way to perceive it to perceive

504
00:41:20.94 --> 00:41:22.94
Think feel and behave

505
00:41:23.66 --> 00:41:25.66
That's what culture is

506
00:41:25.66 --> 00:41:31.10
New members come on and that culture is gonna tell them how to perceive things how to think how to feel and how to behave

507
00:41:31.10 --> 00:41:34.78
The group then start to take this accumulated learning for granted

508
00:41:35.90 --> 00:41:37.90
As a system of beliefs

509
00:41:38.22 --> 00:41:44.86
Values and behavioral norms this is culture this is what you're trying to build inside your company this what you're trying to build inside your team

510
00:41:44.86 --> 00:41:46.38
This what you're trying to build inside your Pultoon

511
00:41:47.42 --> 00:41:54.22
When this happens the system turns into based turns into basic assumptions and eventually drops out of the out of conscious awareness

512
00:41:54.22 --> 00:41:56.70
You want that culture so ingrained that people aren't even thinking about it

513
00:41:58.14 --> 00:41:59.18
What's the deal?

514
00:41:59.18 --> 00:42:05.50
Dave what's the deal with Marines wearing flip flops on base?

515
00:42:07.66 --> 00:42:13.18
Is that legal or illegal illegal so be in that where when I was

516
00:42:14.14 --> 00:42:16.14
You know

517
00:42:16.54 --> 00:42:22.62
When I was in the derbs and I would go to MCRD right and I would you know

518
00:42:22.62 --> 00:42:31.50
I would have like a short haircut and I would be dressed, you know just whatever and I you know surf shorts t-shirt flip flops

519
00:42:32.46 --> 00:42:35.10
And sometimes occasionally

520
00:42:35.74 --> 00:42:38.70
I would get a look a second look. Oh, yeah like whoa

521
00:42:39.98 --> 00:42:46.46
You know you can see and I never actually had anybody say anything to me. I never had somebody cross over and say hey Marine

522
00:42:46.46 --> 00:42:52.62
And maybe it's because of bad by this point I never really went to MCRD a lot until I was a little older

523
00:42:53.02 --> 00:42:57.90
You know if I would have been younger I probably have gotten called out definitely okay. That's good to know

524
00:42:58.38 --> 00:43:03.50
So that's culture right yeah, I mean the so that's the culture in the Marine Corps you don't wear flip flops and so really close

525
00:43:03.82 --> 00:43:09.58
Certainly not on base. I mean I remember one of my first overseas deployments were my wife actually came and spent a little time with me

526
00:43:09.58 --> 00:43:14.38
Which is kind of uncommon. It was a Japan deployment so you know not obviously a common deployment

527
00:43:14.38 --> 00:43:18.62
But she came out spend a little time and just up the road was the seven day store

528
00:43:18.62 --> 00:43:22.62
Which is like I never in Marine base you can get like you know so does or whatever and

529
00:43:23.42 --> 00:43:25.42
You can rent videos or do and

530
00:43:25.66 --> 00:43:30.54
There she was in there getting something and two young Marines walked in and there was like a Marine gun research

531
00:43:30.54 --> 00:43:36.30
Just standing there on the Saturday afternoon not doing anything but at the front door and every Marine that showed up with flip flops

532
00:43:36.86 --> 00:43:38.46
He made him turn a

533
00:43:38.46 --> 00:43:44.94
Made him leave and it was like a three quarter mile walk and I get up there was a total bummer you know is they gonna have vehicles or young kids or 18 years old

534
00:43:45.50 --> 00:43:47.74
And just the looks on those young Marines faces just the

535
00:43:48.62 --> 00:43:52.46
Dejected look and she came back and she's like what is the deal?

536
00:43:53.58 --> 00:43:57.42
Like Marines don't wear flip flops. That's the deal

537
00:43:57.82 --> 00:44:02.22
But that's the you know that's that's the culture. That's the culture and you know you can argue all day long

538
00:44:02.22 --> 00:44:05.90
But hey, you know, is this a big deal is not a big deal? There's an argument that says like dude is it a big deal

539
00:44:05.90 --> 00:44:07.90
You can make that argument and then the other argument is

540
00:44:09.10 --> 00:44:13.06
What is more important than the culture in the Marine court? So I

541
00:44:13.58 --> 00:44:15.10
Of course was like

542
00:44:15.10 --> 00:44:19.74
The Marines don't wear flip flops on this like that's what I don't remember what else is there for me to say yeah exactly

543
00:44:19.74 --> 00:44:23.42
Marines don't wear flip flops. Thank you period next question beer now

544
00:44:25.10 --> 00:44:27.18
But yeah, that's the thing that's absolutely a thing

545
00:44:27.58 --> 00:44:31.02
Yeah, and that so that's like the perfect culture, right? That's the perfect

546
00:44:31.02 --> 00:44:35.82
Exactly why I asked you that question because what is more important than the culture in Marine court?

547
00:44:37.50 --> 00:44:40.06
Marines don't wear flip flops period and story

548
00:44:40.38 --> 00:44:44.22
There's a level of professionalism that is we don't go below that's right

549
00:44:44.94 --> 00:44:47.10
And I just use the word we to describe the

550
00:44:50.06 --> 00:44:52.70
Culture is similar to a computer's

551
00:44:53.18 --> 00:44:57.34
Operating system it is the basic rule set about how the computer works

552
00:44:57.98 --> 00:44:59.98
But it operates in the background

553
00:44:59.98 --> 00:45:05.98
We have to purposefully examine the operating system if we want to learn how it affects the computer's operations

554
00:45:06.38 --> 00:45:11.34
Culture is like this rule set operating in the background while influencing a group thoughts and actions

555
00:45:13.18 --> 00:45:19.82
Culture like an operating system receives updates in adjustments over time as more is learned and as it adjusts to new threats and opportunities

556
00:45:19.82 --> 00:45:27.10
Culture however changes organically while an operating system relies on human intervention now. What's interesting about that?

557
00:45:27.10 --> 00:45:29.10
is

558
00:45:31.42 --> 00:45:37.50
You have to check your culture sometimes how do you check your culture? I'll give you one guess what you do is you take a step back and you write down what the culture is

559
00:45:38.46 --> 00:45:41.42
Now here's where you might be let us try I might think oh

560
00:45:43.26 --> 00:45:46.38
I want to know about the culture my Patoon so I write down my Patoon

561
00:45:47.50 --> 00:45:53.58
You know gets to work first my Patoon puts the job first my Patoon we take care of each other my Patoon

562
00:45:53.58 --> 00:45:57.74
We look sharp all the time whatever whatever these things are

563
00:45:58.78 --> 00:46:00.78
That's the culture in your Patoon

564
00:46:03.26 --> 00:46:08.86
I can't just say I can't just interject a new culture

565
00:46:09.66 --> 00:46:12.22
Line into that and have it just be

566
00:46:13.02 --> 00:46:16.94
What well that's the new that's that's now the culture you can't do that

567
00:46:18.06 --> 00:46:20.94
Culture is how they describing it cultures organic

568
00:46:20.94 --> 00:46:25.58
Yeah, now listen over time you can make it you know hardcore Rikando's

569
00:46:26.38 --> 00:46:32.06
Hardcore Rikando's right the 439th with hackworth he interjected hey from now on

570
00:46:32.86 --> 00:46:38.70
The the salutation is hardcore Rikando's no fucking slack and he says

571
00:46:39.74 --> 00:46:48.38
At first what did they do they laughed and they're gonna go go life for who's this freaking life for right and then it started to cut

572
00:46:48.38 --> 00:46:51.82
He pin start to creep into the consciousness so

573
00:46:52.78 --> 00:46:55.90
You can interject something and just expect it to be accepted

574
00:46:56.70 --> 00:47:03.98
And but as he as you interject something and if you are a good leader and you said a good example and you start keeping your troops alive

575
00:47:03.98 --> 00:47:10.46
Which hackworth did and you start going on offense and you start winning and people start to embrace these things that you brought on board

576
00:47:10.46 --> 00:47:13.18
You can make that culture have a shift

577
00:47:13.18 --> 00:47:19.26
So what you have to be careful of though which have to be careful of and why it's good to step back and do an assessment and write down

578
00:47:19.26 --> 00:47:23.10
What you think your culture is is you can make sure there's nothing in there that says

579
00:47:23.66 --> 00:47:27.34
Platoon comes first screw everyone else we don't want that culture

580
00:47:28.06 --> 00:47:33.34
Now when you start thinking okay, I know I can't just line out screw everyone else and now we're good

581
00:47:34.70 --> 00:47:39.58
I have to say how am I gonna slowly organically change this culture

582
00:47:40.38 --> 00:47:42.38
into what it should be

583
00:47:42.38 --> 00:47:45.34
Do that's not easy man. I mean like you're describing that

584
00:47:45.34 --> 00:47:50.14
I mean god, I'm almost embarrassed to give my version of that or my example of that as a commander

585
00:47:50.14 --> 00:47:52.38
Because compared to hackworth it's just so ridiculous

586
00:47:52.94 --> 00:47:56.14
But when I took command my my first

587
00:47:56.38 --> 00:48:02.38
Operational command as an F 35 squadron commander was the very first F 35 squadron the Marine Corps ever

588
00:48:03.18 --> 00:48:06.06
And what I was given in that squadron were

589
00:48:06.78 --> 00:48:11.02
Hornet guys and hairy your guys and then there was coast hornet guys and he's coast horned guys

590
00:48:11.02 --> 00:48:14.14
And you know this probably similar on the team's East Coast and West Coast

591
00:48:14.14 --> 00:48:16.78
They're actually in a lot of it's very different

592
00:48:16.78 --> 00:48:21.82
So if you flew Hornets on the West Coast you got a lot of cultural norms that are different than Hornets on the East Coast

593
00:48:22.06 --> 00:48:27.90
And then I got a whole different so I had four different cultures really Hornets hairyers East Coast West Coast and the first thing

594
00:48:27.90 --> 00:48:32.70
One of the first things I Institute of when I got there as the commander to her like we are a 35 guys

595
00:48:32.70 --> 00:48:37.50
There's no more Hornet guy. There's no and I don't care if you're background if you fly hairyers and cherry point Hornets and jib jib jib jib

596
00:48:37.50 --> 00:48:38.54
It doesn't matter

597
00:48:38.54 --> 00:48:44.94
Because there was some connotation like oh the Hornet guys were better air to air the hair your guys are better air to ground because that's where they came from well this new airplane

598
00:48:44.94 --> 00:48:46.94
There we need to do it all so

599
00:48:47.18 --> 00:48:49.66
It was there was some resistance of

600
00:48:50.06 --> 00:48:56.94
That's where I came from that's my identity and that's what we are and it took some time to

601
00:48:57.42 --> 00:49:02.14
Resist against to push against that but what I wanted the rest of the world to know about us was

602
00:49:03.02 --> 00:49:06.38
This is what we do not this is where we used to do this where it came from and so

603
00:49:06.38 --> 00:49:10.06
Even some some some some some for resistance of that right thought everything would be on board of that

604
00:49:10.06 --> 00:49:13.74
It took some time for guys to release that I that former

605
00:49:14.06 --> 00:49:20.22
Identity of what what we were and I think in some ways it's good because it speaks to how strong the culture is

606
00:49:20.30 --> 00:49:25.90
But the bigger issue is how hard it is to change the culture and if they don't buy a new it's not

607
00:49:25.90 --> 00:49:30.46
It's never going to happen if they don't buy into that change that change will not happen

608
00:49:30.46 --> 00:49:36.54
It has to be has to be organic it has to take it's gonna take time you have to plant the seeds

609
00:49:36.54 --> 00:49:39.58
You have to let you have to let it grow inside their own minds, right?

610
00:49:39.58 --> 00:49:42.62
You can do your best to plant seeds, but it's gonna have to come from inside

611
00:49:43.74 --> 00:49:49.10
You can't really impl it's very difficult can't see you can't it difficult to impose culture yeah

612
00:49:53.18 --> 00:49:58.30
Although culture has a wide variety of attributes we will highlight time risk and mindset as we

613
00:49:58.30 --> 00:50:02.62
Consider how culture might affect the way our rivals approach competition

614
00:50:03.10 --> 00:50:10.22
Collectivists or group focus cultures emphasize the importance of the group over the individual and often feel compelled to reach decisions

615
00:50:10.30 --> 00:50:15.90
By gaining consensus which frequently takes time to develop from an American orientation

616
00:50:17.42 --> 00:50:20.46
This may appear to take too long from a collective

617
00:50:21.10 --> 00:50:27.82
Culture orientation achieving consensus might be considered so important that taking months or even years to reach a decision

618
00:50:27.82 --> 00:50:29.82
Is given higher priority

619
00:50:30.62 --> 00:50:33.42
Neither perspective is objectively right or wrong

620
00:50:33.98 --> 00:50:37.58
But each is logically consistent when viewed from its

621
00:50:38.46 --> 00:50:40.46
respective cultural orientation

622
00:50:42.46 --> 00:50:47.50
I have a note here my note says both these are wrong from a leadership perspective

623
00:50:49.26 --> 00:50:55.18
Let let them come up with the plan let them come up the idea and provide support to it

624
00:50:55.18 --> 00:51:00.78
That's a lot faster. It's a lot faster for me to say hey Dave you know, hey, what is your team want to do here?

625
00:51:01.10 --> 00:51:03.98
I'll tell you what come up with a plan and and brief me on the plan

626
00:51:05.26 --> 00:51:10.94
Not arguing I'm not looking for consensus. I'm just looking for a good idea that's pretty close and we're gonna run with it

627
00:51:11.66 --> 00:51:12.86
Just the

628
00:51:12.86 --> 00:51:14.86
Jesus it gets consensus

629
00:51:14.86 --> 00:51:18.86
When you're not trying to create the consensus oh oh oh oh oh

630
00:51:19.42 --> 00:51:24.14
Wait, I agree. Okay, we're done. We're done trying we're done trying to get consensus. I love your idea

631
00:51:24.14 --> 00:51:26.14
Yeah, oh yeah, you're right. You're right. You're awesome. Yes

632
00:51:27.74 --> 00:51:34.46
What about when there's nine people cool help guide those guide those nine people to give consensus to each other

633
00:51:35.74 --> 00:51:40.70
Consensus is consensus being becomes a battle when you inject ego into it

634
00:51:41.98 --> 00:51:46.06
So otherwise we just asked some questions and we figured out what the best solution isn't we move forward

635
00:51:46.86 --> 00:51:48.86
Add a question the other day two days you

636
00:51:48.86 --> 00:51:54.30
What do you do when you keep when you check your ego but you still want to do your plan?

637
00:51:55.50 --> 00:51:57.90
So someone talking about two people on their team

638
00:51:58.30 --> 00:52:01.18
They both had different plans same outcome but the different ways to do it

639
00:52:01.50 --> 00:52:04.38
What happens when you check your ego and still want to do your plan?

640
00:52:05.18 --> 00:52:07.18
Like well actually

641
00:52:07.18 --> 00:52:09.18
If you check your ego and

642
00:52:09.18 --> 00:52:11.82
You see that their plan is gonna get to the same outcome

643
00:52:12.30 --> 00:52:15.58
You'll do their plan and it was probably how often would you do that my answer was

644
00:52:15.58 --> 00:52:21.90
100% of the time or or it and it like is often is humanly possible

645
00:52:23.42 --> 00:52:26.30
And just the only

646
00:52:26.30 --> 00:52:31.34
The only barrier to the things your child of a copeless the barrier to consensus is you

647
00:52:32.38 --> 00:52:33.74
It's

648
00:52:33.74 --> 00:52:36.86
If as long as you're aligned as long as you're going to the same place

649
00:52:38.46 --> 00:52:40.46
The only reason why you won't do it

650
00:52:40.46 --> 00:52:47.02
Their way is your ego and the minute you agree to do it their way you have alignment and consensus and you're moving

651
00:52:47.58 --> 00:52:49.58
And it's your life gets so much better

652
00:52:50.14 --> 00:52:57.42
Yeah because when I want to do it my way in Dave wants to do it Dave's way and I spend nine hours trying to present my case

653
00:52:57.42 --> 00:53:01.34
And he's arguing against me and he's actually going to do some research and bringing back some facts and figures

654
00:53:01.74 --> 00:53:03.18
We already executed plan

655
00:53:03.18 --> 00:53:08.14
And I said hey Dave that looks pretty good go with it and by the way also now when I say hey Dave

656
00:53:08.14 --> 00:53:13.74
Dude your plan looks awesome. Let's roll with it. How can I support and then two hours later go hey Dave

657
00:53:13.74 --> 00:53:17.98
There's this thing over here. Do you think I could adjust this? What's your attitude your attitude to? Oh, yeah, absolutely

658
00:53:18.62 --> 00:53:25.34
Make my plan even better right that's what we're doing and you mentioned it the only time that we're the only time

659
00:53:25.34 --> 00:53:28.94
I can't come to consensus with you if like I'm not getting there

660
00:53:30.14 --> 00:53:32.70
If we can't figure out like my plan or your plan

661
00:53:32.70 --> 00:53:34.38
I need to say okay way way way way way second

662
00:53:34.38 --> 00:53:41.58
What what where do you actually want to go when we know are we aligned because if we're not actually going to the wrong to the same play if we're going to the same place

663
00:53:42.14 --> 00:53:45.90
Subordinate your ego and let's go. I'm good totally. This sounds like a great plan Dave

664
00:53:46.46 --> 00:53:54.62
My day is gonna take an extra two hours cool. I'm net five hours gained because I didn't spend seven hours arguing

665
00:53:58.54 --> 00:54:03.18
Different orientations also result in different attitudes towards identifying and weighing risk

666
00:54:03.18 --> 00:54:07.82
This may lead to behavior that is surprising to us for example Chinese and Russian ships

667
00:54:08.86 --> 00:54:14.22
And aircraft have maneuvered in close proximity to US forces which appears to us as unnecessary

668
00:54:14.70 --> 00:54:18.30
unnecessarily dangerous and operating against agreed international protocols

669
00:54:18.62 --> 00:54:24.78
We may especially view such behavior as strange when we think of ourselves as at peace with them

670
00:54:25.90 --> 00:54:32.70
Taking these risk might look quite different from another viewpoint operating this way may seem just divide to those who see them

671
00:54:32.70 --> 00:54:37.02
selves in a condition of war without bloodshed or embracing without fighting

672
00:54:38.94 --> 00:54:41.90
Finally different cultures produce different mind sets

673
00:54:43.42 --> 00:54:51.58
As mentioned above culture is a system of beliefs values and behavioral norms that operate in the background below the level of conscious awareness

674
00:54:53.02 --> 00:54:59.26
This produces a frame of mind that seeks to make the right choice in a given situation with right being defined

675
00:54:59.26 --> 00:55:03.82
By these background factors. They have they've both those rights in quotes

676
00:55:05.82 --> 00:55:14.22
This produces a frame of mind that seeks to make the quote right this choice in a given situation with quote right being defined by those back background factors

677
00:55:14.38 --> 00:55:17.42
This is all also often labeled intuition

678
00:55:19.02 --> 00:55:24.94
When somebody makes an intuitive choice while within their own culture the choices often judged as correct by others from that culture

679
00:55:24.94 --> 00:55:32.54
This is because the criteria they used to determine if correct aligns with the beliefs values and norms that originally informed the intuitive choice

680
00:55:32.54 --> 00:55:36.78
However people from a different culture have different judging criteria

681
00:55:37.26 --> 00:55:40.94
Originating from different values beliefs and norms which leads them to intuitive choices

682
00:55:41.58 --> 00:55:43.58
likely quite different from ours

683
00:55:43.58 --> 00:55:54.62
It will be difficult for people to explain why they made these choices because the criteria they used are below conscious thoughts

684
00:56:00.94 --> 00:56:02.94
That's why

685
00:56:02.94 --> 00:56:04.94
When you are building a team

686
00:56:05.98 --> 00:56:08.38
That's why culture is the

687
00:56:08.38 --> 00:56:12.70
purest form of decentralized command because

688
00:56:14.46 --> 00:56:19.90
Because they're making decisions without even without even thinking about it and they're making the right decisions if the culture is there

689
00:56:20.86 --> 00:56:27.26
They can make a decision without even thinking about it without even thinking about it. They're making the right decision with that with no thought because the culture is strong

690
00:56:28.94 --> 00:56:35.18
That's what we're trying to do. Hey, should I should I cut corners on this safety protocol?

691
00:56:35.18 --> 00:56:41.50
No actually I'm not even thinking about I'm gonna do the right thing. Hey Dave actually. Hey you can't go out there without your proper PPE

692
00:56:41.90 --> 00:56:43.90
Oh, yeah, sorry got it

693
00:56:44.46 --> 00:56:48.70
Not you know I'm not gonna say anything. Well if the culture is there the decisions already made

694
00:56:49.58 --> 00:56:54.46
The decisions already made we're doing the right thing think about that with everything that you're doing inside your organization

695
00:56:54.78 --> 00:56:59.26
Your culture should drive decision making all the way down to the front line troops

696
00:57:00.54 --> 00:57:03.26
And if you don't have good culture, what do you end up with apple grave?

697
00:57:03.26 --> 00:57:10.06
Yeah, you end up with some front line troops that are out there on their own. They don't have good culture and they do dumb things

698
00:57:12.46 --> 00:57:18.38
Dumb things that have a negative strategic impact and I don't feel that that worked around lightly

699
00:57:21.42 --> 00:57:27.50
Yeah, and of course I wrote DC in the margins as you're reading that I write down DC and you're coming back to that and you even went like

700
00:57:27.50 --> 00:57:36.38
That's a you're talking deep decentralized I mean all the way down at the highest level of your if you're running a team and just

701
00:57:37.10 --> 00:57:43.42
The basic level of decentralized command is what that culture allows them to do is make decisions without asking you questions

702
00:57:44.14 --> 00:57:47.98
You know in the first step of your decentralized command is well, I've got seven people on my team

703
00:57:48.62 --> 00:57:52.38
I can't be with them all the time and I need them to do stuff without me. How do I make that happen?

704
00:57:53.34 --> 00:57:55.34
The culture's what allows that to happen so they don't go

705
00:57:55.34 --> 00:57:57.02
Hmm

706
00:57:57.02 --> 00:58:02.86
Maybe it's a call, Jocco to see what I should do in the situation. I don't have to call you because I know what to do

707
00:58:02.86 --> 00:58:05.50
So it's the most basic level there and then

708
00:58:06.22 --> 00:58:12.06
That there's just a little warning inside there though. That's just that tiny little warning that you're highlighted is oh by the way right is in quotes

709
00:58:13.18 --> 00:58:15.18
It's just

710
00:58:15.42 --> 00:58:17.42
Let's not

711
00:58:17.42 --> 00:58:24.78
Let's not be so committed to our culture that we don't recognize that that has to evolve over time as well and then we don't have to just like you said

712
00:58:25.42 --> 00:58:31.98
Write down and make sure hey are are are my people not even critically thinking about anything anymore

713
00:58:31.98 --> 00:58:34.78
Those decisions that are subconscious and so natural

714
00:58:35.58 --> 00:58:41.02
Am I at the point now where where they are almost like devoid of consciousness of content of contemplating is this

715
00:58:41.74 --> 00:58:43.74
the right thing to do in the big picture and

716
00:58:43.74 --> 00:58:45.74
and

717
00:58:45.98 --> 00:58:53.66
That the orientation peeing. I'm just pulling it back to the orientation of when it's it's almost perceived like an error when somebody on my team

718
00:58:53.66 --> 00:58:56.86
The team that have to go culture they do something that's that's an outlier

719
00:58:57.02 --> 00:59:03.34
It's like a it's like the crash on the computer like it is so obvious in this operating system. We have a massive error and everybody sees it

720
00:59:04.22 --> 00:59:06.22
But they submit this point of like

721
00:59:06.22 --> 00:59:13.18
The it might they might not even be able to explain why they did it because it's below the level of consciousness they are seeing something

722
00:59:14.22 --> 00:59:16.22
Their perception is different

723
00:59:16.78 --> 00:59:17.82
And

724
00:59:17.82 --> 00:59:19.82
That's a that is that is a warning

725
00:59:20.38 --> 00:59:26.30
Yes, it's a warning that they're that their culture is not there. That's right. I got two things on this number one

726
00:59:27.42 --> 00:59:30.30
This is just a classic example that happened today

727
00:59:31.26 --> 00:59:32.54
Jamie

728
00:59:32.54 --> 00:59:34.54
Operations director Ashillon front

729
00:59:34.54 --> 00:59:36.54
I'm talking to Pete

730
00:59:37.74 --> 00:59:45.26
Origin and we're going over something and Jamie calls me. I'll call you back. You know give me five I text her

731
00:59:47.02 --> 00:59:49.02
Talking to Pete

732
00:59:49.02 --> 00:59:51.02
45 seconds later. I was two minutes later

733
00:59:51.50 --> 00:59:53.50
She texted me don't worry

734
00:59:53.50 --> 00:59:55.50
uh made the call

735
00:59:55.50 --> 00:59:57.50
And you know what I wrote back

736
00:59:57.66 --> 01:00:02.54
Approved I don't even know what the call was I don't know what she was talking about but I know that Jamie

737
01:00:02.54 --> 01:00:07.82
She called me kind of probably is just like a basic check but then she's like I've got this yeah

738
01:00:08.38 --> 01:00:10.38
That's number one now

739
01:00:10.38 --> 01:00:12.38
Number two. I used to I used to give this example of

740
01:00:14.22 --> 01:00:16.54
decentralized command extreme ownership

741
01:00:18.86 --> 01:00:22.54
of I try to think of the most extreme example of

742
01:00:23.42 --> 01:00:25.42
where I'm

743
01:00:25.42 --> 01:00:28.14
the CEO of a manufacturing company

744
01:00:29.98 --> 01:00:31.98
and

745
01:00:31.98 --> 01:00:33.98
There's a thousand people that work

746
01:00:34.86 --> 01:00:36.86
in each one of my

747
01:00:36.86 --> 01:00:44.06
10 factories so there are 10 thousand people and one of those people has a job where they're in a room by themselves

748
01:00:45.74 --> 01:00:53.66
And their job is to take part a and put it on top of part b and and that's it take part a

749
01:00:53.66 --> 01:00:55.90
Put it on top of part b and let it go

750
01:00:57.42 --> 01:01:00.38
And if that person screws that up

751
01:01:00.38 --> 01:01:02.38
And doesn't do it right

752
01:01:02.78 --> 01:01:07.90
How can that be my fault right how can that possibly be my fault and there's there's

753
01:01:09.74 --> 01:01:13.74
It's it's really easy to fall on the chop of what I actually did I mean you've got 10 factories

754
01:01:13.74 --> 01:01:18.70
They have a thousand people each this is one person that's literally the front line this is a minimum wage individual

755
01:01:19.74 --> 01:01:21.74
How can that possibly be your fault and

756
01:01:22.78 --> 01:01:24.78
That's that's a that's a

757
01:01:24.78 --> 01:01:30.78
The reasoning behind that is pretty that's pretty good logic look there's 10 thousand people

758
01:01:32.86 --> 01:01:38.94
In 10 factories there's one guy in one room he's the lowest paid guy and he screws up this

759
01:01:39.50 --> 01:01:43.02
This job how can that possibly be my fault you know what?

760
01:01:43.98 --> 01:01:46.38
I can't be my fault you know fire the guy move on

761
01:01:47.02 --> 01:01:51.90
That's one thing and I can fire the guy and move on right here's the problem with that what did I change

762
01:01:51.90 --> 01:01:59.34
What did I change anything so if I if I take extreme ownership of that and say hey listen here's what's going on

763
01:02:00.22 --> 01:02:04.78
I didn't get the guy trained upon as well as I should have I didn't explain to or you know

764
01:02:04.78 --> 01:02:07.74
It's not in the system it's not in the training I haven't said a proper training

765
01:02:07.74 --> 01:02:10.94
I don't have the manager explaining why it's important for a to go on top of b

766
01:02:11.74 --> 01:02:16.06
I haven't given the training I haven't screened my people properly because maybe this guy just isn't capable

767
01:02:16.06 --> 01:02:20.62
Maybe doesn't have the the cognitive capacity to do that function that's also my fault

768
01:02:20.62 --> 01:02:23.34
So so all these things and all these things are things that I will change

769
01:02:25.10 --> 01:02:30.38
And that's going to make us moving the right direction and look at my gonna ever get to a point where no one's going to make a mistake

770
01:02:30.46 --> 01:02:36.06
In that room on those no I'm not but I'm gonna mitigate it as much as possible every single time and that's

771
01:02:36.62 --> 01:02:40.14
infinitely better than saying oh, it's not my fault that's a front line guy fireman move on no

772
01:02:40.62 --> 01:02:46.02
Take ownership of it. How can we prevent this from happening so I always that was kind of my example of how I could really

773
01:02:46.02 --> 01:02:54.50
Isolate someone that's just totally detached. I was talking to a company the other day and I was like I think I think this one might be even better

774
01:02:55.78 --> 01:02:57.14
if

775
01:02:57.14 --> 01:02:59.14
one of my seals

776
01:02:59.86 --> 01:03:04.74
At my training command where I've got 150 seals one of my seals

777
01:03:06.18 --> 01:03:11.06
Get drunk out in town and get into a fight and get arrested

778
01:03:12.66 --> 01:03:14.66
How can that possibly be my fault

779
01:03:14.66 --> 01:03:17.62
And maybe it's easier to understand of course

780
01:03:17.86 --> 01:03:21.46
What have I done wrong? I haven't explained why it's important not to get in trouble

781
01:03:21.46 --> 01:03:25.46
I haven't explained no behavior. I haven't explained how it impacts negatively impacts the team

782
01:03:25.46 --> 01:03:30.02
I haven't explained how it negatively impacts the training that you're supposed to be teaching

783
01:03:30.26 --> 01:03:37.70
I haven't explained to him how how important it is for his family and how this is gonna get him busted and how it's gonna get him to lose pay

784
01:03:37.70 --> 01:03:44.26
And I haven't explained that your negative impact to the teams impacts America by the way

785
01:03:46.02 --> 01:03:50.58
And so look him I got to prevent every person from you know every guy on my command from ever no

786
01:03:50.58 --> 01:03:56.58
I'm at least going to make efforts to prevent that from happening and what's the best way to do that the best way to do that is through culture

787
01:03:57.78 --> 01:04:04.34
The best way to do that is through culture is by saying listen our mission here is to get these guys trained up

788
01:04:04.34 --> 01:04:12.14
So they can go and be prepared to go overseas do the mission and bring all the guys home as much as humanly

789
01:04:12.30 --> 01:04:16.54
possible that's what our mission is everything else doesn't even doesn't even come close

790
01:04:17.06 --> 01:04:19.06
That's what we do that's what we do

791
01:04:19.06 --> 01:04:23.62
That's what we do every single day. We save our friends lives every day by giving them the best training

792
01:04:25.22 --> 01:04:27.22
You gotta get that culture

793
01:04:27.38 --> 01:04:29.06
So that's all me

794
01:04:29.06 --> 01:04:34.58
And so on me as a leader and I got X I got to look at the culture. I got to step take a step back and say what is the culture and am I gonna be able to change it overnight?

795
01:04:34.58 --> 01:04:37.86
No, I'm not is any leader gonna be able to change it overnight? No, we're not

796
01:04:38.82 --> 01:04:45.06
But do you need to start shifting in and right direction? Yes, you do and by the way who's in charge of culture at an organization every single person that's there

797
01:04:45.86 --> 01:04:55.46
If you're no if you're in an organization you're you are the culture the way you act impacts the culture the way you think impacts the culture the way you behave impacts the culture

798
01:04:55.46 --> 01:04:59.06
And that's that should be empowering

799
01:05:00.34 --> 01:05:07.22
That should make you feel good that look my boss acts like an idiot doesn't matter our culture doesn't I'm not gonna act like an idiot

800
01:05:12.18 --> 01:05:14.18
What you tolerate

801
01:05:14.18 --> 01:05:19.10
impacts the culture you're telling that story. I'm just thinking about why Marines don't wear flip-flops on base

802
01:05:19.10 --> 01:05:21.10
And what you tolerate in back to culture

803
01:05:21.10 --> 01:05:24.46
I mean that that whole story I mean

804
01:05:27.18 --> 01:05:33.90
Echo what what was and I am embarrassed I'm losing the word we're talking about last time when you when you

805
01:05:33.90 --> 01:05:38.86
Eda don't it you convince yourself it's okay. It's not justification. What's the word that you you've tell yourself

806
01:05:38.86 --> 01:05:42.62
Association now when you when you can visualize the rationalization and

807
01:05:43.34 --> 01:05:48.46
The talk about it last time is like how that's all those are all lies you tell yourself you rationalize you justified is

808
01:05:48.46 --> 01:05:54.74
Hey there are 10,000 people in this company come on man. I'm one guy

809
01:05:55.18 --> 01:06:03.42
What do you really expect from I'm supposed to now manage the junior guy at the farthest away plan on a different time zone it's just and

810
01:06:05.02 --> 01:06:11.82
That's scenario we get asked that question some from the question all the time and there's a rationalization of I can't I can't actually do that

811
01:06:13.10 --> 01:06:15.74
And when you rationalize at or

812
01:06:15.74 --> 01:06:19.98
Confincious off of that what happens is nothing changes nothing. There's nothing changes

813
01:06:20.46 --> 01:06:24.70
And how easy does it go? Well look at this scenario. Dude. It's not four people in the same room. It's

814
01:06:25.62 --> 01:06:28.94
That's my overseas plant with a different country in a different but

815
01:06:29.90 --> 01:06:34.82
Cool you can rationalize your way out of it and guess what's gonna happen? A's not gonna go on top of B and that product isn't gonna work

816
01:06:36.94 --> 01:06:43.38
There was a little like guideline that I kind of implemented obviously on a very low level

817
01:06:43.38 --> 01:06:50.20
But when when you were you talk about extreme long time when you talk about extreme ownership and those kinds of scenarios where it's like on the surface

818
01:06:50.20 --> 01:06:53.58
It's real obvious that's not your responsibility seemingly right?

819
01:06:53.58 --> 01:06:55.58
Okay, okay

820
01:06:55.58 --> 01:07:00.30
Yes, sir is it okay. Yeah, so basically the little guidelines would be like okay

821
01:07:00.30 --> 01:07:05.30
Don't look at it like whose fault it is or isn't just consider that automatically it's your like

822
01:07:05.30 --> 01:07:09.26
Let's say you weren't even part of the whole situation you're just some outside consult it

823
01:07:09.26 --> 01:07:10.78
I don't know consultant whatever

824
01:07:10.78 --> 01:07:14.98
Let's say you were tasked with hey from an external perspective

825
01:07:15.22 --> 01:07:19.02
What moves can you make to be sure that that never happens again?

826
01:07:19.46 --> 01:07:25.66
So instead of like because you know when you say extreme long time I'm gonna take the blame that blame kind of indicates that like

827
01:07:26.38 --> 01:07:30.38
Ooh, you should get in trouble kind of a thing which can kind of trigger some people

828
01:07:30.38 --> 01:07:37.46
I think it makes people scared. Yeah, it makes people scared but you shouldn't be scared because who do I want?

829
01:07:37.46 --> 01:07:39.46
Who do I want working for me?

830
01:07:40.66 --> 01:07:48.54
Dave that comes in and says hey project failed because the contractors didn't do their job or Echoes that says hey project failed because I didn't do a good job

831
01:07:48.86 --> 01:07:54.56
Managing the contractors to make sure they held the line. Yeah, fully so the so like I said like

832
01:07:54.56 --> 01:07:57.62
It's your way to get to the point where you can understand okay

833
01:07:57.62 --> 01:08:03.22
This is on me is to kind of use that guideline like pretending your head kind of thing like mid

834
01:08:03.22 --> 01:08:08.54
What if you're tasked with making sure it never happened again and that's what all those little things that you would always say

835
01:08:08.54 --> 01:08:14.54
It started to make so much more sense where it's like oh, yeah because there is a scenario where that guy who's putting trying to put a on top of B

836
01:08:14.54 --> 01:08:16.02
We're we're like

837
01:08:16.02 --> 01:08:19.14
He straight up just doesn't like you. He doesn't like this company

838
01:08:19.14 --> 01:08:21.70
He doesn't even want the job. He just his grandma

839
01:08:21.70 --> 01:08:27.22
Okay, they get it you know all this stuff right and he should not be there. Yeah, who's fault is that he's there?

840
01:08:27.22 --> 01:08:33.18
I bet again listen all look at it. Who's fault? I'm saying as far as my little guy like so no, this isn't a guideline what this is

841
01:08:33.18 --> 01:08:35.98
It's the little this is a nice little crunch crunch

842
01:08:37.98 --> 01:08:44.14
That kind of helps you move towards this direction so if your ego has a hard time saying this was my fault

843
01:08:44.14 --> 01:08:50.86
If you need the crutch of like okay, I'm gonna I'm gonna look at this and just see what I can do to make sure that doesn't happen again

844
01:08:50.86 --> 01:08:52.86
Yeah, if you need that crutch

845
01:08:52.86 --> 01:08:56.74
Go for it and maybe echo Charles is gonna write a book called

846
01:08:59.02 --> 01:09:05.30
How to sort and take ownership of some stuff without feeling bad about it. Okay. Okay. The last part was acceptable

847
01:09:05.30 --> 01:09:07.30
But here's the thing

848
01:09:07.30 --> 01:09:08.30
Oh

849
01:09:08.30 --> 01:09:10.30
Okay, yeah, you like

850
01:09:10.30 --> 01:09:12.30
The crunch

851
01:09:12.30 --> 01:09:14.70
Echo sort of leaves it

852
01:09:14.70 --> 01:09:23.82
In you way I'm just saying that will help solve the problem of these scenarios where it's like how could I possibly?

853
01:09:24.54 --> 01:09:28.82
Be responsible for XYZ like that that to me

854
01:09:29.58 --> 01:09:34.54
Made it like a lot more clear way more automatically. Yeah, made it easier for you to digest

855
01:09:36.18 --> 01:09:38.50
A little bit of sugar with the medicine

856
01:09:38.50 --> 01:09:47.14
It's okay next section how rivals view the competitive environment rivals operating from within different systems often perceive that they are under threat

857
01:09:47.30 --> 01:09:48.30
Especially

858
01:09:48.30 --> 01:09:51.02
Competitors with all four terian governments

859
01:09:51.02 --> 01:09:57.70
Regime survival is usually the top priority in these states. Yeah, look at look at North Korea how it's all just like we're good

860
01:09:57.70 --> 01:09:59.70
We are about to be attacked

861
01:10:01.46 --> 01:10:07.86
These rivals also look for opportunities to reduce perceived threats while also working to expand their competitive options

862
01:10:07.86 --> 01:10:13.50
Our rivals constantly study the elements of US national power in an effort to exploit to either

863
01:10:14.06 --> 01:10:19.66
Either to offset UF's advantages or to find scenes to exploit for example

864
01:10:19.66 --> 01:10:25.90
The Soviet Union during the Cold War developed in the elaborate system to measure the correlation of forces between the United States and the USSR

865
01:10:26.10 --> 01:10:31.46
Which was further broken down in a correlation of economic forces the correlation of military forces et cetera the thought process

866
01:10:31.46 --> 01:10:38.26
heavily influences Russia today as they continue to deeply study the United States Sunshu's famous statement know you're in me and know yourself

867
01:10:38.26 --> 01:10:44.38
Highlights a perhaps even deeper cultural imperative for China to study the United States in the West damn that's true

868
01:10:45.74 --> 01:10:46.74
Finally

869
01:10:46.74 --> 01:10:52.06
Some rivals have a different outlook about the legitimacy of using aggressive action

870
01:10:52.82 --> 01:10:57.26
Like offensive cyber operations interference in other states in internal politics

871
01:10:57.26 --> 01:11:04.30
Disinformation et cetera can tell this is a recently written document to change the status quo in international relations

872
01:11:04.58 --> 01:11:06.18
their actions

873
01:11:06.18 --> 01:11:13.90
Their actions show they do not feel bound by standing international agreements and norms unless they can use those agreements

874
01:11:15.10 --> 01:11:19.36
To their advantage instead their behavior shows they recognize

875
01:11:19.70 --> 01:11:25.30
Resource constraints or hard power to turn as they only kind of limits they might respect

876
01:11:25.30 --> 01:11:31.34
This is when you're playing by different rules basically this is when two people two countries are playing by two different rules

877
01:11:31.34 --> 01:11:38.28
And there's just violations. I know that's one of your favorite words echo Charles violations people do violations

878
01:11:39.10 --> 01:11:42.10
That they can kind of know that they can get away with and

879
01:11:43.22 --> 01:11:48.38
We are sitting here like well, you're not allowed to do that. They're like what do you think we're doing?

880
01:11:48.38 --> 01:11:54.52
I'm almost one of those. What do you think I'm doing? Of course, of course, I'm going to heal you we're wearing ghee

881
01:11:55.24 --> 01:11:57.36
Well, you know we're grappling kind of right?

882
01:12:01.66 --> 01:12:04.54
Differing approach to competition campaigning

883
01:12:05.38 --> 01:12:10.54
This is the next section all the above leads to a permanent struggle mindset

884
01:12:12.66 --> 01:12:15.66
It's a good way to go through life with a permanent struggle mindset

885
01:12:15.66 --> 01:12:23.26
This is like enduring competition is what we're calling it. Hey, we're always competing they're calling it permanent struggle

886
01:12:23.82 --> 01:12:32.82
Do you think the word struggle has a connolly call like a like a like a flavor of like you're losing does it kind of imply that you're kind of losing?

887
01:12:33.82 --> 01:12:38.18
I think I get what you're saying I get yes, I think I think you get what you're saying

888
01:12:38.78 --> 01:12:40.98
Yeah, it gives you the impression that we're the underdog

889
01:12:40.98 --> 01:12:45.62
Yeah, we are struggling right if you were to say we if you say I'm struggling

890
01:12:46.90 --> 01:12:50.10
That that doesn't mean I'm winning yeah, right?

891
01:12:50.10 --> 01:12:58.34
That's a different scenario yeah struggling. So yes, so when you end up with a permanent struggle mindset we are behind

892
01:13:00.34 --> 01:13:05.62
And it continues on there is no at peace condition even when they choose to cooperate in a particular area

893
01:13:05.62 --> 01:13:11.38
So even when it's like even when I work in with to this trade deal cool there's still a struggle going on behind the scenes

894
01:13:11.38 --> 01:13:18.42
It will be question it will it becomes a question of when and how they will compete not if they will be competing

895
01:13:19.14 --> 01:13:25.74
With this month with this as the mindset the tools used to create competitive advantages are limited only by human creativity and

896
01:13:26.02 --> 01:13:30.94
Available resources these rivals might take an action primarily to advance their economy

897
01:13:30.94 --> 01:13:37.26
But they also will attempt to leverage that action to gain an advantage this mindset causes them to try and

898
01:13:37.34 --> 01:13:39.66
Exploit that any chance they see a more emerging

899
01:13:40.38 --> 01:13:48.18
When they believe their competitors are distracted by other world events they will seize on any opportunity this presents

900
01:13:49.46 --> 01:13:51.46
Distraction distracted by other events

901
01:13:51.46 --> 01:14:00.82
It's so obvious how this stuff plays out every single day in the news

902
01:14:01.94 --> 01:14:09.18
The following are common characteristics of our rivals approach to competition is a bunch of bullet points strong central command and control

903
01:14:11.82 --> 01:14:13.82
Clear strategic goals

904
01:14:13.82 --> 01:14:19.82
You know, people talk about China and just these they're like if they're playing this massively long strategic game

905
01:14:19.82 --> 01:14:25.38
They're playing the way long game. They don't care. They're looking at their people like oh yeah kind of like oh, it's so whatever

906
01:14:26.38 --> 01:14:32.34
Look we got some people that are working as slaves or human rights or horrible or we got to eliminate this group

907
01:14:32.34 --> 01:14:35.18
No factor. We're playing the long strategic game here. We got a game to win

908
01:14:37.74 --> 01:14:39.74
Clear strategic goals powerful narratives

909
01:14:41.74 --> 01:14:46.50
Hello propaganda weaponizing benign activities and

910
01:14:46.50 --> 01:14:55.26
They actually gave a big example what that was all about like weaponizing like tourists and cutting off tourists from going to certain areas recruitment

911
01:14:56.62 --> 01:14:58.62
of ethnic

912
01:14:58.62 --> 01:15:00.62
deasporous

913
01:15:00.62 --> 01:15:02.26
so

914
01:15:02.26 --> 01:15:08.62
Those are fleeing ethnic groups. I'll find out who's kind of been hard dumb by and see if we can bring them into the fold

915
01:15:09.50 --> 01:15:14.06
Domination of ethnic media interference in local politics strong enforcement action

916
01:15:14.06 --> 01:15:20.62
Fostering relationships with local groups including criminal and terrorist organizations assertion of extra territorial rights

917
01:15:22.58 --> 01:15:27.94
Intelligence and covert operations encouragement of dependencies powerful military cover

918
01:15:28.54 --> 01:15:33.24
Expanded concept of combined arms acceptance of high levels of risk

919
01:15:33.82 --> 01:15:35.82
Postured for the long term

920
01:15:36.98 --> 01:15:42.82
They combine these characteristics in a novel and innovative ways to pursue their goals while taking advantage of United States

921
01:15:42.82 --> 01:15:48.30
And it's allies at blind spots and then they have parentheses like being quote at peace

922
01:15:48.82 --> 01:15:51.82
That's like a blind spot for us. Oh, or a piece. We're not at war with them

923
01:15:54.34 --> 01:15:56.34
I think what you know

924
01:15:57.22 --> 01:15:59.78
From from this whole this whole time we've been talking about

925
01:16:01.18 --> 01:16:03.66
Winning without the enemy know that they were even fighting

926
01:16:04.42 --> 01:16:10.30
They don't want to provoke us. They want us to be like thinking everything is cool and meanwhile there's maneuver's happening

927
01:16:10.30 --> 01:16:20.82
Arrival concept for competition next section the idea of a theory of victory applied to competition

928
01:16:21.58 --> 01:16:27.18
Warfighting explains how the Marine Corps uses maneuver warfare to shatter an enemy's cohesion throughout

929
01:16:27.70 --> 01:16:30.70
Through a variety of rapid focused and unexpected actions

930
01:16:31.18 --> 01:16:33.98
Which create turbulent and rapid

931
01:16:33.98 --> 01:16:39.26
Turbulent and rapidly deteriorating situation with which the enemy cannot cope?

932
01:16:40.74 --> 01:16:45.06
That's a good idea rapid focused on expected actions. That's what we're trying to do

933
01:16:45.50 --> 01:16:52.30
This is maneuver warfare's theory of victory to splinter the enemy's system so that it can no longer function effectively

934
01:16:54.14 --> 01:17:00.58
We can apply the idea of a theory of victory to competition to discern how rivals approach it each rival

935
01:17:00.58 --> 01:17:07.66
Use his own theory of in competition, but we can make some useful generalizations Marines can use to analyze

936
01:17:08.02 --> 01:17:13.08
Specific competitors first each of this class of rivals governs itself through an a third a

937
01:17:13.24 --> 01:17:17.02
Thoritarian power structure with regime survival as its top priority

938
01:17:17.46 --> 01:17:23.54
This heavily influences all the other competitive choices made both domestically and internationally in these rival theories

939
01:17:24.14 --> 01:17:28.70
Next these rivals strive to avoid war with the United States

940
01:17:28.70 --> 01:17:31.86
That's what I just said and its allies

941
01:17:32.54 --> 01:17:34.94
Note that war is not the same as violence

942
01:17:35.50 --> 01:17:41.06
These rivals will selectively crossover the threshold of violence against the United States or its allies and partners

943
01:17:41.06 --> 01:17:45.06
But we'll be careful to keep a tight reign on it so it does not escalate into war

944
01:17:46.86 --> 01:17:52.26
These discrete pulses of violence can be useful for boundary stretching and decree hesitation

945
01:17:52.26 --> 01:17:58.82
This is not a fixed principle as rivals continue to study the United States. They may come a time when when they believe

946
01:17:58.82 --> 01:18:01.70
Bading the United States or its allies into war gives them an advantage

947
01:18:02.02 --> 01:18:07.58
If they also believe they have developed the strength to prevail a little learning there a little warning

948
01:18:08.26 --> 01:18:14.82
With these two principles as background our rivals approach competition as a constant state of being so every decision and

949
01:18:15.26 --> 01:18:21.30
Action affects it thus they are either setting conditions that will make it easier to achieve their goals

950
01:18:21.30 --> 01:18:26.78
Or they are reaching their goals through slow increments or operant tunistic lunges

951
01:18:30.66 --> 01:18:34.72
They're they're they're this is what they're doing they're constantly paying attention to this

952
01:18:36.30 --> 01:18:43.14
They constantly have this massive strategic goal way down the line that they're playing that long long long-long game

953
01:18:43.14 --> 01:18:53.78
We can summarize their their theory of victory and competition like this these rivals think of the relationship as winning without fighting

954
01:18:53.78 --> 01:18:58.94
Hmm or winning war before it starts and not as competition

955
01:19:00.70 --> 01:19:04.94
Regime survival is the number one goal and they believe their regime is costly under threat

956
01:19:04.94 --> 01:19:08.66
So competition is one of perpetual struggle every action

957
01:19:08.66 --> 01:19:14.62
They take shapes the environment to make it easier to reach their goals either domestically or internationally and this environment

958
01:19:14.62 --> 01:19:22.30
They are they are either incrementally moving toward their goals or on alert to seize one if an opportunity presents itself

959
01:19:23.42 --> 01:19:25.42
So that's what we've got a pay attention to

960
01:19:27.74 --> 01:19:30.90
Wrap up this chapter with the conclusion to

961
01:19:30.90 --> 01:19:39.30
To compete effectively Marines need to focus their potential on their potential competitors especially those who see themselves as rivals

962
01:19:39.54 --> 01:19:44.54
To the United States and it's allies truly understanding these potential rivals require serious reflection and critical thinking

963
01:19:44.54 --> 01:19:52.62
The Udalu offers a model to examine why and how rivals approach competition differently the strength of orientation affects all aspects of the model

964
01:19:52.62 --> 01:19:57.10
The elements contained in a person's groups or in a person or groups orientation

965
01:19:57.10 --> 01:20:05.74
Work in the background it takes deep study to first identify these elements and then learn how they affect the decisions and actions or rival takes

966
01:20:08.38 --> 01:20:16.70
And then it just goes on there are their mindset of perpetual struggle means they are constantly shaping the environment to make it easier for them to reach their goals

967
01:20:18.58 --> 01:20:23.88
It also means they constantly take incremental steps toward their goals while remaining alert for the chance to

968
01:20:23.88 --> 01:20:32.72
Pounce on them if an opportunity arises. That's a tough competitor. That's a tough competitor constantly constantly making maneuvers

969
01:20:35.16 --> 01:20:40.44
And now we move into chapter five the conduct of competition

970
01:20:41.72 --> 01:20:44.36
The challenge the challenge is to develop a

971
01:20:44.52 --> 01:20:45.32
concept of

972
01:20:45.56 --> 01:20:53.40
Competition of former means that stays in balance with our preparation for war remains consistent with our understanding of the nature and theory of competition and

973
01:20:53.40 --> 01:20:56.88
accounts for the realities of international strategic competition

974
01:20:57.60 --> 01:21:00.28
So we got to be but this is a big balancing thing we're working on

975
01:21:02.04 --> 01:21:09.20
maneuver warfare is influence Marines can use maneuver warfare principles to great effect in competition

976
01:21:10.44 --> 01:21:14.60
We still seek to achieve our goals in a flexible and opportunistic way

977
01:21:15.24 --> 01:21:20.48
That's a beautiful statement about leadership that's a beautiful statement about leadership

978
01:21:20.48 --> 01:21:26.24
Not just about maneuver or forever leadership. You seek to achieve your goals in a flexible and opportunistic way

979
01:21:26.96 --> 01:21:29.92
Isn't it way better for me to say oh Dave you want to

980
01:21:31.16 --> 01:21:36.36
You want to go into that market area? Great. I'll tell you what run with it

981
01:21:37.28 --> 01:21:40.76
That's an opportunity for me to grow the business based on Dave's

982
01:21:41.36 --> 01:21:43.36
Drive

983
01:21:43.36 --> 01:21:47.64
And by the way, I was thinking about going somewhere else, but Dave wants to go there cool that flexible

984
01:21:47.64 --> 01:21:53.84
We seek to achieve a relative temple advantage that we can gain the initiative

985
01:21:55.20 --> 01:22:01.80
Marines in depth understanding of the Udalupe is relevant everywhere on the competition continuum

986
01:22:03.16 --> 01:22:07.36
Marines should not seek to reinvent maneuver warfare for competition

987
01:22:07.36 --> 01:22:12.84
But rather think through how it can be applied across the competition continuum and

988
01:22:12.84 --> 01:22:18.44
Not just to the continuum's subset that deals with war and the various forms of warfare

989
01:22:22.08 --> 01:22:29.80
Orienting on the competitor next section orienting on the competitor is fundamental to successful competition

990
01:22:29.80 --> 01:22:34.84
We develop our understanding of the competitor system and then exploit the weaknesses we find in it

991
01:22:36.84 --> 01:22:38.84
I dread that with a wrong voice

992
01:22:38.84 --> 01:22:49.28
Sorry to the United States Marine Corps. Let me re-hash that we develop our understanding of the competitor system and then exploit the weaknesses

993
01:22:49.28 --> 01:22:51.28
We find in it

994
01:22:51.56 --> 01:22:52.92
Much better

995
01:22:52.92 --> 01:22:55.92
We develop models of the rival system and

996
01:22:56.36 --> 01:22:59.56
Then use these models to share our understanding of it with others

997
01:22:59.72 --> 01:23:03.88
We then develop ways to test our model in the real world real world

998
01:23:03.88 --> 01:23:09.48
We observe our tests then use feedback from these observations to improve the model Marines learn about the Udalupe

999
01:23:10.04 --> 01:23:13.40
Early in their service, which helps them move through the cycle smoothly

1000
01:23:14.20 --> 01:23:19.74
War fighting teaches that we should try to get inside and adversaries and thought processes and

1001
01:23:20.20 --> 01:23:22.20
See them as they see themselves

1002
01:23:22.84 --> 01:23:26.16
So that we can set them up for defeat. There's Dave Burke

1003
01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:30.78
Adversary wing commander. What was your name adversary officer?

1004
01:23:30.78 --> 01:23:32.78
I

1005
01:23:32.78 --> 01:23:35.78
Kind of elevated you got like when can and that's

1006
01:23:36.26 --> 01:23:41.26
That's that's beautiful thing we take you and we say your job is to think like the enemy yep

1007
01:23:41.78 --> 01:23:44.06
It's cool at at trade at we did that too

1008
01:23:44.06 --> 01:23:52.78
We didn't do it on in such an official manner, but it was okay trade at opposing force guys the guys that were working directly for me at trade at

1009
01:23:53.58 --> 01:23:58.48
You're gonna go and act like the enemy did you call it red cell if I have that we called it up for up for yeah

1010
01:23:58.48 --> 01:24:01.86
I've heard of the different terms. Yeah, I think it's all the same thing. It's you behave

1011
01:24:02.36 --> 01:24:06.04
Like the enemy partially is it's it gives you your guys realistic training

1012
01:24:06.04 --> 01:24:09.18
But it also is to think why are they doing the things that they're doing why would they

1013
01:24:09.80 --> 01:24:14.72
acquire the weapons and do the formations there's a whole bunch of reasons why you would do that yeah, and then what's cool is

1014
01:24:15.36 --> 01:24:19.32
Because we'd read AR's what the enemy did you know the enemy started using false walls

1015
01:24:19.32 --> 01:24:27.56
We started using false walls the enemy did bear kitties. We do it so we would follow the reports and do it they did but what's really cool to is when you're when you're up for

1016
01:24:28.80 --> 01:24:34.44
You can see what it looks like you can see what our tactics look like you see with a strength and weaknesses are see

1017
01:24:34.44 --> 01:24:39.24
You see how obvious it is when a guy's doing something stupid. I'm never gonna do that. Yeah

1018
01:24:39.24 --> 01:24:44.000
I was just gonna say it keeps you from falling into the trap of thinking everything they're doing is stupid

1019
01:24:44.80 --> 01:24:48.68
Because everything they're doing is different right like we see that you're saying the enemy the enemy

1020
01:24:48.68 --> 01:24:53.54
Yeah, I mean it that that so we don't fall in the trap of oh they're doing this. That's dumb

1021
01:24:53.54 --> 01:24:58.68
We'd never do that and being dismissive of the fact that that move that they are making which we probably wouldn't make

1022
01:24:59.32 --> 01:25:01.32
Oh, hang on

1023
01:25:01.32 --> 01:25:06.96
Why are they all nice that's exactly and there's those moments of oh hey hang on a second

1024
01:25:07.16 --> 01:25:12.76
This is why they're doing that and if you don't put yourself in their eyes the easy trap that you go trappers

1025
01:25:12.76 --> 01:25:19.96
Let's dumb what do they know what end that's the one that's why it's all centered around orientation is if you understand

1026
01:25:19.96 --> 01:25:21.96
They're perspective your far less likely

1027
01:25:22.36 --> 01:25:28.12
We have this saying like when we see something that we don't think is it concerned us we scoff it scoff

1028
01:25:28.12 --> 01:25:35.64
Hey, he did this scoff no factor don't care and over time what you will do is everything that's sort of different from what you would do

1029
01:25:36.64 --> 01:25:42.16
Is wrong that's like the classic ego responses you didn't do it the way I do it you're wrong. Let's just scoff term

1030
01:25:42.16 --> 01:25:43.44
Can you explain that's me again?

1031
01:25:43.68 --> 01:25:48.20
So let's say you and I are fighting in our airplanes and you do some move you beam out to the west

1032
01:25:48.20 --> 01:25:50.68
Are you flanking some direction and I think it's you know?

1033
01:25:50.68 --> 01:25:56.80
It's not a concern to me. I'll scoff that move. I don't even acknowledge it don't even care do whatever you want scoff no factor no factor

1034
01:25:56.80 --> 01:26:00.28
Because I'm always isn't it isn't an arrogant move?

1035
01:26:00.40 --> 01:26:05.28
Well, it it can be there are times I actually don't want to respond to what you're doing

1036
01:26:05.28 --> 01:26:07.84
You might be baiting me into something making a bad decision

1037
01:26:07.84 --> 01:26:13.12
You might be pulling me into a place that I don't think I want to go so there are times that I want to dismiss just I'm not gonna react to that

1038
01:26:13.12 --> 01:26:17.12
I'm not going to respond to your move, but if it's habitual and

1039
01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:21.52
I determine every single time you do something it's no factor

1040
01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:27.04
sooner or later it actually will be a factor and one of the ways that we counter that is the orientation of

1041
01:26:27.44 --> 01:26:31.92
Recognizing while they're doing that and what that's what I got to do is the officer officer is think like them

1042
01:26:31.92 --> 01:26:37.44
And then hey, this way I did that and we would build scenarios the training scenarios against the students I would create those

1043
01:26:37.44 --> 01:26:42.08
I help create those we're turning this we're turning that we're doing all these things to try to get to this outcome

1044
01:26:42.40 --> 01:26:48.48
And if the student could dissect and understand that then he understands what's going on and if not then he doesn't and that's a bad thing

1045
01:26:49.44 --> 01:26:51.44
Chuck

1046
01:26:51.44 --> 01:26:56.08
Continuing on it is essential that we understand our adversary on their own terms

1047
01:26:56.08 --> 01:27:02.56
We should not assume that every adversary thinks as we do competes we do or shares our values and objectives

1048
01:27:03.20 --> 01:27:09.44
Marines in the Marine Corps are strong tools for our nation to compel or deter our rivals as discussed in chapter two

1049
01:27:09.44 --> 01:27:14.88
We know that the target of our compelence or deterrence must cooperate

1050
01:27:15.92 --> 01:27:17.92
Even if they're unwilling if we are to be effective

1051
01:27:19.28 --> 01:27:22.88
Our knowledge of the competitor system will help us understand their thinking

1052
01:27:22.88 --> 01:27:28.48
Enough to make good judgments on how we can force this possible unwilling cooperation

1053
01:27:29.84 --> 01:27:31.84
That's such a good

1054
01:27:31.84 --> 01:27:36.64
Such a strange way of putting it unwilling cooperation, but it happens happens in the jutsu

1055
01:27:37.52 --> 01:27:43.60
Like I start to choke you echo you have to defend your neck. It's unwilling, but you you got to do it

1056
01:27:45.20 --> 01:27:47.20
Wait, that's the same as coercion right?

1057
01:27:47.20 --> 01:27:49.20
Yeah, similar

1058
01:27:49.20 --> 01:27:54.000
Marines in the Marine Corps are also strong tools in a strategy of attraction

1059
01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:58.96
We can demonstrate our national values through efforts such as humanitarian assistance programs providing highly credible

1060
01:27:59.28 --> 01:28:04.56
Support to the informational element of national power Marines regularly play a large role in

1061
01:28:04.96 --> 01:28:14.16
Building and then sustaining relationships with allies and partners strong networks such as these increase our competitive options and create challenges for our competitors

1062
01:28:14.16 --> 01:28:24.96
Next section shaping the action our competition goals are derived from our vital national interests and we must think ahead if Marines are to support reaching these goals

1063
01:28:25.52 --> 01:28:31.92
Boy if you're in charge of a company don't you hope and pray that everyone in your company every division in your company

1064
01:28:31.92 --> 01:28:37.12
Everyone on your team is thinking about your vital interests inside your organization

1065
01:28:37.12 --> 01:28:46.56
and thinking ahead we establish that what we want to accomplish why and how this provides a vision for

1066
01:28:46.96 --> 01:28:52.56
Succeeding in competition which in turn helps align the actions taken towards reaching the goals

1067
01:28:55.12 --> 01:29:02.24
In both the near and long-term we orient on our competitor to develop our understanding of their system

1068
01:29:02.24 --> 01:29:11.20
We continually refine our models of their system so that we can focus on their weaknesses including increasing our understanding of how their culture affects their decision making process

1069
01:29:11.76 --> 01:29:13.76
Man, you got to know what your competitors thinking

1070
01:29:14.88 --> 01:29:16.72
They just say this over and over again

1071
01:29:16.88 --> 01:29:26.32
Similarly, we must try to see ourselves through our competitors eyes in order to identify our own vulnerabilities that makes that they may try to exploit

1072
01:29:26.56 --> 01:29:31.44
To influence the future we consider how we can exploit our competitors weakness while protecting our own

1073
01:29:31.44 --> 01:29:33.44
This usually takes the form of planning

1074
01:29:35.28 --> 01:29:37.04
I think beyond planning it takes the

1075
01:29:37.60 --> 01:29:41.74
Takes the form should take the form or at least extend to the form of a war gaming or

1076
01:29:42.64 --> 01:29:45.74
Red selling or whatever you want to call it totally

1077
01:29:46.52 --> 01:29:48.52
Forsoin force training our

1078
01:29:49.92 --> 01:29:56.56
Plans will not always produce a detailed time-tailed move of events as we accept that competition's may unfold over a long time

1079
01:29:56.56 --> 01:30:03.04
Instead, we attempt to shape the general conditions of the competition since marine support our larger national competitive effort

1080
01:30:03.36 --> 01:30:11.60
We first need you to determine who we are supporting this support limited only by our imaginations and available resources can take a variety of forms

1081
01:30:12.16 --> 01:30:20.44
Across all our operating domains for example our force posture exists in all domains and can contribute to the deterrence in these domains

1082
01:30:20.44 --> 01:30:27.24
Through the diplomatic and informational elements of power it can also improve relationships with our allies and partners

1083
01:30:27.64 --> 01:30:35.40
Force posture can help develop ties with partner militaries that lead to attracting top performing international officers to our service schools

1084
01:30:35.92 --> 01:30:43.88
Which further deep in the relationship expanding relationship like this shapes our campaign of competition by increasing the potential number of competitive action

1085
01:30:43.88 --> 01:30:47.64
We can take think about what you can do inside your organization if you're in business

1086
01:30:47.64 --> 01:30:54.66
If you just take that section about working with other people get training other what if you took people from other companies?

1087
01:30:54.66 --> 01:31:03.20
Maybe maybe not quite competitors, but maybe competitors and you brought them up more and you train them and you help them you develop a relationship and you find out that there are various weaknesses

1088
01:31:04.20 --> 01:31:11.18
That you could help them and maybe you have some areas weakness they could imagine if you took that long-term strategic vision of how to grow

1089
01:31:12.08 --> 01:31:14.08
your influence

1090
01:31:14.08 --> 01:31:17.28
Look man that's kind of that's

1091
01:31:17.92 --> 01:31:25.28
That's kind of my career in a nutshell this this exchange thing or this this sharing of information your main core my Marine core career so

1092
01:31:26.40 --> 01:31:32.64
When as a Marine I spent so much of my time not being in a traditional Marine core role and

1093
01:31:32.88 --> 01:31:36.44
You know early on in flight school like the Marine core goes to Navy flight training

1094
01:31:36.44 --> 01:31:39.44
So we're very similar and it's it's not a Marine core center thing

1095
01:31:39.44 --> 01:31:44.72
But even in my my experience you know my first four years in the Marine core I was in a Marine core squadron

1096
01:31:44.72 --> 01:31:49.96
But we were attached to a carrier so we spent a lot of time with the Navy doing things in Navy way and then when I went to Top Gun

1097
01:31:50.04 --> 01:31:53.36
That's a Navy command. I was basically kind of an exchange officer

1098
01:31:53.36 --> 01:31:56.000
So I'm kind of really seeing how the other services do it

1099
01:31:56.000 --> 01:32:01.64
I did a full Air Force exchange where I was basically in the Air Force for three and a half years

1100
01:32:01.64 --> 01:32:06.56
I command about Air Force Division as a Marine to serve the Air Force and then

1101
01:32:06.56 --> 01:32:10.34
My all these different things that I did a very much

1102
01:32:10.88 --> 01:32:16.60
Interacted as an exchange to other services and what it got me out of is kind of that classic Marine core echo chamber of

1103
01:32:16.72 --> 01:32:22.64
This is how the Marine core operates and I learned so much and just that sharing of information from and

1104
01:32:22.96 --> 01:32:27.16
Rivals is a strong word we were not rivals, but the Air Force and the Navy Marine core are different

1105
01:32:27.76 --> 01:32:31.92
So we're all looking for the same end, but the point you just made of the power of that

1106
01:32:31.92 --> 01:32:38.96
I'm probably not gonna go to a rival company that doesn't gonna want to give me their people but inside different divisions that have kind of

1107
01:32:38.96 --> 01:32:45.28
Competing interest inside your own organization and getting one guy from marketing to go spend six months on the operation side or one

1108
01:32:45.28 --> 01:32:46.44
Getting you know a couple guys thing operations

1109
01:32:46.44 --> 01:32:52.68
I spend some time with sales where they see it and truly understand what's going on the power of that inside your organization

1110
01:32:52.68 --> 01:32:56.32
So you don't just buy off on the narrative of listen you join the Marine core

1111
01:32:56.80 --> 01:33:01.36
You're not gonna get a lot of feedback that Marine core isn't doing everything right until you get out of the Marine core

1112
01:33:01.36 --> 01:33:06.88
Go oh damn you guys are doing things a lot differently than us and that seems to be working really well and of course vice-versa

1113
01:33:06.96 --> 01:33:13.26
But I think there's a ton of power that I was really lucky in my experience to get to do that way more than most Marines get to do and

1114
01:33:13.28 --> 01:33:18.16
It it helped me individually it helped the services and it helped the Marine core. It was awesome

1115
01:33:18.32 --> 01:33:22.12
Yeah, old school ship board deployments that I did working with the Marine core

1116
01:33:22.12 --> 01:33:29.16
That's so lucky. I was working with you know calling in battalions and working with the airway airwings on the on the

1117
01:33:29.16 --> 01:33:34.76
Flat top and just was so awesome for me and I learned so much. It was ridiculous

1118
01:33:34.76 --> 01:33:43.16
It's so easy to create a story or a narrative in your mind of how dumb everything else is when you don't experience it

1119
01:33:43.80 --> 01:33:49.92
And it's so it happens so naturally in your subconscious of the differences means they're wrong

1120
01:33:49.92 --> 01:33:55.32
And the minute you spend some time over there doing it and you see from the perspective the orientation changes

1121
01:33:55.32 --> 01:34:00.56
You think you see how vibe on is whether it's your competitors whether it's your peers whatever it is

1122
01:34:00.96 --> 01:34:05.84
That change in perspective that change in orientation immediately reveals a whole bunch of things

1123
01:34:05.84 --> 01:34:10.28
You would never see if you just look at it from your perspective and I'm like dumb I'm not doing that

1124
01:34:11.84 --> 01:34:19.64
That's I was very lucky in my career to get to see that over and over from from different perspectives and changing my orientation of the problem all the time

1125
01:34:19.64 --> 01:34:21.64
Yeah, yeah, if you're no leaders

1126
01:34:21.64 --> 01:34:26.94
A very simple way to do that when your leadership position go down and check out some other. See what they're doing

1127
01:34:26.94 --> 01:34:33.70
Like oh go run that thing through the line go operate that piece of equipment for a half an hour go check out that job site see what's going on

1128
01:34:34.56 --> 01:34:39.000
So many good ways to change your perspective improve your perspective see more

1129
01:34:39.80 --> 01:34:46.000
Next section combined arms combined arms is the full integration of arms in such a way that

1130
01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:52.60
To counteract one the enemy must be more vulnerable to another we pose the enemy

1131
01:34:52.88 --> 01:34:57.60
Not just with a problem, but with the dilemma a no win situation

1132
01:34:57.60 --> 01:35:00.16
This is the way Marines fight and win battles

1133
01:35:00.88 --> 01:35:09.52
This idea also governs how Marines compete even though we broaden no win situations to include careful consideration of positive some options

1134
01:35:09.52 --> 01:35:18.10
Win win options the governing idea is to orchestrate all of our tools together in ways that are most favorable to us

1135
01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:27.24
A combined arms mindset leads wanted to consider how to use multi domain tools for to of all potential partners in an effort to reach one calls

1136
01:35:28.52 --> 01:35:32.76
The ideas to use all available resources to best advantage internal the Marine Corps

1137
01:35:33.04 --> 01:35:37.34
We look to combine complementary characteristics of different types of units create a competitive advantage

1138
01:35:37.34 --> 01:35:41.98
externally we look to combine our capabilities with those of joint force to create advantage

1139
01:35:42.82 --> 01:35:48.14
We apply the same mindset in competition when we combine our capabilities with those of our joint and interagency

1140
01:35:48.86 --> 01:35:50.62
Partners what what is the Marine Corps saying here?

1141
01:35:51.34 --> 01:35:56.66
We're gonna look we're gonna look and utilize and work with and cooperate with as many different

1142
01:35:56.66 --> 01:36:07.40
Elements as we possibly can to to get the best advantage we can over our rivals this

1143
01:36:07.40 --> 01:36:14.42
Same mindset applies to combining the complementary characteristics of Marines with other partners whether they're from other

1144
01:36:14.42 --> 01:36:16.58
US government department or from an allied country

1145
01:36:16.58 --> 01:36:21.54
We orient on the competitor because we want to make sure the combined arms dilemma

1146
01:36:21.54 --> 01:36:25.26
We intend to present in competition is actually a problem for them this

1147
01:36:27.18 --> 01:36:34.56
Mindset leads Marines to develop holistic plans designed to reach specific goals in both war and along the larger competition

1148
01:36:34.56 --> 01:36:41.18
Continuum in competition the idea of combined arms extends through joint force inner agency to allies and partners

1149
01:36:42.42 --> 01:36:47.48
So we don't necessarily have we don't we don't have to be at war at all

1150
01:36:47.48 --> 01:36:52.000
To go out and work and combine our efforts with other

1151
01:36:53.36 --> 01:36:55.36
Other elements that can give us advantages

1152
01:36:58.32 --> 01:37:00.82
Next section campaign of competition

1153
01:37:02.04 --> 01:37:08.78
Embracing the mind embracing the competition mindset leads to the realization that the Marine Corps plays and important

1154
01:37:08.78 --> 01:37:19.14
But supporting role and our nation's various competitions now I have to take a pause there because this idea of supporting role in

1155
01:37:20.38 --> 01:37:22.38
the military

1156
01:37:22.38 --> 01:37:25.80
It's the the word supporting in the military is

1157
01:37:26.90 --> 01:37:33.86
Can be taken as offensive right because what it means is you know if Dave's got a platoon and I've got a platoon

1158
01:37:33.86 --> 01:37:40.22
Dave and Dave is assigned as the supporting platoon and I'm the main effort

1159
01:37:41.18 --> 01:37:43.18
Dave is

1160
01:37:43.18 --> 01:37:45.18
Inferior to me

1161
01:37:45.18 --> 01:37:51.10
That's the backup that's the second string. He's the JV team you can look at throw whatever you want to throw on

1162
01:37:51.90 --> 01:37:54.54
The idea that you're in a supporting role is

1163
01:37:55.74 --> 01:37:57.74
generally viewed as a negative

1164
01:37:58.46 --> 01:38:01.46
especially in in military doctrine

1165
01:38:01.46 --> 01:38:07.28
Well, if you let your ego get totally and what the Marine Corps is doing here is beautiful

1166
01:38:07.28 --> 01:38:12.78
Which is saying hey, we play a important but supporting role. They get it they're like hey, we're supporting. It's fine

1167
01:38:13.70 --> 01:38:21.14
This forms our approach and by the way that was one of the best things that we did in task unit bruiser in Ramadi it was hey we're here to support

1168
01:38:22.46 --> 01:38:28.10
Hey hey battalion commander, Haber Gade commander, hey company commander. We're here to support you

1169
01:38:28.10 --> 01:38:34.82
By the way, we're gonna kill a bunch of bad guys. We're gonna have to freaking do the best operations. We can possibly do

1170
01:38:35.82 --> 01:38:37.82
You want to call supporting cool. We're supporting

1171
01:38:38.70 --> 01:38:40.70
That's fine and by the way by by

1172
01:38:42.02 --> 01:38:46.58
Us being by us supporting a battalion that means that battalion is rolling you know

1173
01:38:46.58 --> 01:38:51.34
Casivac as rolling out tanks is rolling out firesport. We're getting all the air. We're getting everything we want

1174
01:38:52.10 --> 01:38:56.78
We're getting more assets than we could have ever imagined and we're we're supporting them

1175
01:38:56.78 --> 01:38:59.90
It's even though we always said we were supporting

1176
01:39:00.98 --> 01:39:11.30
What we had 13 guys in an Overwatch position mean while they have a battalion out there to help us get to that position get out of that position

1177
01:39:11.30 --> 01:39:15.46
It's amazing. Yeah, but the attitude of hey we're here to support

1178
01:39:16.70 --> 01:39:22.14
Well, that's the attitude that gave you all the flexibility to do what you wanted. It's it's the exact same approach that I took and

1179
01:39:22.14 --> 01:39:27.94
I remember when I first got there I went around all the units in the A or that I had a connection to

1180
01:39:28.62 --> 01:39:34.68
And the the question the literal question I asked all of the commanders was how can I support you and

1181
01:39:35.36 --> 01:39:37.36
What they want to know is well what do you have and

1182
01:39:38.70 --> 01:39:40.70
You know what I had I had

1183
01:39:40.70 --> 01:39:42.70
80 million dollars worth of airplanes

1184
01:39:42.86 --> 01:39:47.50
That they couldn't have like hey, I've got this this I got Marines. I have we had gun trucks

1185
01:39:47.50 --> 01:39:53.10
So I had I own umbies with 50 cows and more to 240 got so I had a bunch of stuff and it was just

1186
01:39:54.22 --> 01:39:58.02
Any way you want to use these tools I can provide them for you and

1187
01:39:58.90 --> 01:40:00.50
That attitude

1188
01:40:00.50 --> 01:40:02.90
Coming to them is I'm here to support you is

1189
01:40:04.06 --> 01:40:10.14
What led to me kind of being able to do whatever I wanted on the battlefield almost anything

1190
01:40:10.42 --> 01:40:15.54
Had I walked in and be like this is how I operate this is the exact opposite thing

1191
01:40:15.54 --> 01:40:19.50
They you know and the other part of it too is I didn't own any battle space

1192
01:40:19.50 --> 01:40:24.18
I they could have just said you can't come there get off the battle. They could literally could have pushed me off

1193
01:40:24.18 --> 01:40:26.82
I had no authority at all to operate

1194
01:40:28.18 --> 01:40:30.98
We were in the same exact scenario. Yeah same exact approach

1195
01:40:32.98 --> 01:40:39.14
Back to the book this forms are approached to developing our campaigns of competition campaign goals are established by analyzing and

1196
01:40:39.14 --> 01:40:44.50
During interests and how they are being affected by current policy from Marines these goals are further refined

1197
01:40:44.50 --> 01:40:52.10
By aligning them with the theater combat and commander objectives at every point on the competition continuum both in day-to-day operations

1198
01:40:52.10 --> 01:40:55.14
Below the violence threshold and in the event contingencies

1199
01:40:56.50 --> 01:41:02.26
ID and the event of contingencies ideally the theater objectives will be aligned with inner agency goals as well

1200
01:41:03.70 --> 01:41:05.70
So they're really paying attention

1201
01:41:06.82 --> 01:41:08.82
And breaking things down

1202
01:41:08.82 --> 01:41:12.82
By

1203
01:41:12.82 --> 01:41:21.54
Orienting on the competitor we start to develop theories on how we can reach our campaign goals even though we are in competition with our rival

1204
01:41:22.58 --> 01:41:28.98
Marines understanding of the Udalu pleads us to conclude that the campaign choices we make in the planning are

1205
01:41:28.98 --> 01:41:35.82
Hypothesis the campaign actions. We take test these hypothesis and the UdaluPS and the Udalu

1206
01:41:35.82 --> 01:41:39.26
Many feedback loops help us refine our decisions

1207
01:41:40.46 --> 01:41:47.26
The discipline yet creative application of this process is what allows us to gain the initiative in

1208
01:41:47.58 --> 01:41:50.46
Competition and set it simple discipline yet creative

1209
01:41:52.46 --> 01:41:54.46
Discipline yet creative

1210
01:41:55.26 --> 01:42:01.02
Timelines associated with competitive campaigns are often quite long some extent over several decades

1211
01:42:01.02 --> 01:42:05.02
Yeah, that's that's

1212
01:42:06.06 --> 01:42:08.06
That's where it's tough on America

1213
01:42:08.46 --> 01:42:11.42
That's where it's tough on America because our

1214
01:42:12.54 --> 01:42:19.66
Our regimes only last four to eight years that are whack right and then generally there's gonna be a change in regimes

1215
01:42:19.66 --> 01:42:24.70
There's gonna be a different you know a different campaign of competition happening. Yeah, you were talking about

1216
01:42:25.26 --> 01:42:29.82
The long game and you were talking about China was thinking like they measure it and they call them

1217
01:42:29.82 --> 01:42:33.98
Dynasties they're like thousands of years and the history that they have

1218
01:42:34.78 --> 01:42:43.34
Compared to our history in the recognition of hey you're here as part of the long game their version of the long game is a lot different than our version of the long game

1219
01:42:43.34 --> 01:42:45.34
Yeah, and there's also the party

1220
01:42:47.02 --> 01:42:52.62
That's it. Oh, yes, that's part absolutely and that that strategy is gonna stay the same not a not a ton of

1221
01:42:52.62 --> 01:43:02.38
Infidine going on over there. Yeah on that that's a that's a different viewpoint different orientation

1222
01:43:01.10 --> 01:43:09.98
The iterative nature of competition matched to discipline use of the Udalupe will help planners determine how aggressive one should be in pursuit of campaign goals

1223
01:43:10.54 --> 01:43:14.78
acknowledging these long timelines leads us to consider the consistency of our competitive goals

1224
01:43:14.78 --> 01:43:23.34
If we believe we may need to take many small steps towards a goal over the course of months years decades or decades

1225
01:43:23.34 --> 01:43:26.06
Then our objectives should remain relatively stable during that time

1226
01:43:27.10 --> 01:43:32.06
This is why we look first to our national interest before we derive our competition in campaigning goals

1227
01:43:32.38 --> 01:43:36.62
Once those are determined we then decide how Marines can support achieving them

1228
01:43:36.62 --> 01:43:44.38
The campaigning mindset needs to be applied

1229
01:43:45.42 --> 01:43:51.66
When considering competitive activities especially long term thinking and integrating our actions with others

1230
01:43:51.98 --> 01:43:56.70
Consistency and sustainability lead us to consider the pace or tempo of competition

1231
01:43:57.66 --> 01:44:01.82
This tempo is often driven by a cycle of action and counteraction

1232
01:44:01.82 --> 01:44:11.74
Each campaign and I'm skipping through some stuff here each campaign has a narrative which provides context

1233
01:44:12.38 --> 01:44:16.70
And purpose for the competition our narrative competes with that of our rival

1234
01:44:19.10 --> 01:44:28.06
To defeat a competitors narrative we need to replace it with a more persuasive one simply denying someone story may actually reinforce it in the minds of target audience

1235
01:44:28.06 --> 01:44:33.90
You can't just you can't just that that rumor is gonna come

1236
01:44:34.94 --> 01:44:39.90
You got to tell the story you got to tell the right story that is why we need to replace it when they more compelling story

1237
01:44:39.90 --> 01:44:41.90
Sorry next line

1238
01:44:41.90 --> 01:44:43.42
For example

1239
01:44:43.42 --> 01:44:52.06
Two firms may sell an identical commodity their respective narratives will explain why they are the right choice to win the business of a particular customer

1240
01:44:52.06 --> 01:44:57.18
The stronger narrative will displace the weaker one conclusion our

1241
01:44:58.94 --> 01:45:05.58
War fighting philosophy of maneuver warfare is the philosophy that animates our approach to competition as well

1242
01:45:06.30 --> 01:45:08.14
So for for the Marine Corps

1243
01:45:08.46 --> 01:45:11.26
maneuver warfare is the way we are thinking about everything

1244
01:45:12.46 --> 01:45:18.46
Marines take the same flexible and opportunistic approach to competition as they do towards fighting battles

1245
01:45:18.46 --> 01:45:25.98
The most important tenant of maneuver warfare is to orient on the enemy and this influence is also felt in competition

1246
01:45:25.98 --> 01:45:27.98
We orient on our competitor

1247
01:45:30.30 --> 01:45:31.98
Now

1248
01:45:31.98 --> 01:45:37.50
This one when I read this I was like immediately freaked out because I saw it with most important thing of maneuver warfare is is

1249
01:45:37.66 --> 01:45:39.66
To orient on the enemy and I was like oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

1250
01:45:39.66 --> 01:45:41.66
Tenet of maneuver warfare

1251
01:45:42.14 --> 01:45:46.06
Because maneuver warfare without leadership doesn't do anything leadership's the most important thing

1252
01:45:46.06 --> 01:45:50.86
But if we want to talk tenants I guess we can break it down that orient

1253
01:45:52.22 --> 01:45:54.22
Orienting on the enemy or

1254
01:45:55.66 --> 01:45:58.46
On the competitor sorry, I'm going straight to war

1255
01:45:59.58 --> 01:46:07.02
I'm all the way there on the continuum we need to develop an understanding of our rival if we are to create an effective plan that will help us prevail in competition

1256
01:46:07.18 --> 01:46:09.18
We must understand their system

1257
01:46:10.46 --> 01:46:14.70
Where it is strong and where it is weak this allows us to shape the environment by developing a clear vision

1258
01:46:14.70 --> 01:46:22.78
For our competitive activities this vision also allows us to identify the partners with whom we need to coordinate

1259
01:46:24.86 --> 01:46:28.70
Marines fight using combined arms and we must compete in the same way

1260
01:46:29.50 --> 01:46:32.38
This is the foundational mindset for determining

1261
01:46:33.02 --> 01:46:35.66
How we can present a dilemma to our competitor

1262
01:46:36.38 --> 01:46:41.74
Marines in a Marine Corps are essential tools and our nation's effort to advance our vital national interest

1263
01:46:41.74 --> 01:46:45.50
The Marine Corps makes its greatest contributions near the threshold of violence

1264
01:46:46.94 --> 01:46:51.26
On the competition continuum this Marine this means that individual Marines

1265
01:46:52.46 --> 01:47:00.62
Need to prepare themselves to act on both sides of that threshold and to do so in disciplined ways that advance the nation's interests

1266
01:47:01.90 --> 01:47:03.90
Here's the closing paragraph

1267
01:47:05.18 --> 01:47:06.78
for

1268
01:47:06.78 --> 01:47:08.06
Podcast deep

1269
01:47:08.06 --> 01:47:12.06
Computing is a way of thinking

1270
01:47:13.42 --> 01:47:20.22
Like maneuver warfare it is a state of mind born of boldness boldness intellect

1271
01:47:21.90 --> 01:47:24.70
Initiative and opportunism

1272
01:47:25.82 --> 01:47:29.74
It's very interesting they you do they really start chiming in on this word opportunism

1273
01:47:29.74 --> 01:47:36.22
They really start chiming in on that word and and if you start to pay attention to that

1274
01:47:38.14 --> 01:47:42.86
You start to pay attention the fact that what you should be looking at forwards opportunities and how often do opportunities go to waste

1275
01:47:42.86 --> 01:47:44.62
You want to talk about our life lesson

1276
01:47:45.82 --> 01:47:49.10
boldness intellect initiative opportunities where they are

1277
01:47:51.34 --> 01:47:58.70
It is about understanding our competitor's systems so that we can develop sustain and adapt our competitive advantage so that the Marine Corps will always be a useful tool

1278
01:47:58.70 --> 01:48:03.10
For the nation in the enduring competition that is the normal state of

1279
01:48:03.74 --> 01:48:09.42
International relations one massive a plug for the Marine Corps long game their plan long game for sure

1280
01:48:10.70 --> 01:48:12.70
That is it that

1281
01:48:14.46 --> 01:48:17.42
That wraps up that wraps up this publication for us

1282
01:48:18.38 --> 01:48:20.38
Um

1283
01:48:20.94 --> 01:48:25.50
I think we probably spent eight or nine hours talking through this book in those this is the fourth podcast

1284
01:48:25.50 --> 01:48:27.50
Didn't do too bad today

1285
01:48:28.62 --> 01:48:32.22
God got only knows how much time and effort

1286
01:48:33.26 --> 01:48:36.70
The Marine Corps took and put into

1287
01:48:37.98 --> 01:48:41.34
Putting this together. I mean what's the man hours behind this

1288
01:48:43.66 --> 01:48:46.70
How many people what what were you saying you think it's six seven eight people I?

1289
01:48:47.26 --> 01:48:49.90
That's what I'm pitching on the team. That's on the team. Yeah, that's in there

1290
01:48:49.90 --> 01:48:53.82
That's in the room. That's got the sections and and then there's someone kind of overseeing the whole thing

1291
01:48:53.82 --> 01:48:58.30
And then it's getting signed off by by the common don't he's read he's he's given guidance

1292
01:48:59.18 --> 01:49:03.10
You can tell the common aunts in the game with this stuff. He's not he's not just signed this off

1293
01:49:04.06 --> 01:49:10.54
He's making corrections if there's there's red lines on this in the red written with the common donts pan

1294
01:49:11.58 --> 01:49:17.90
Am I wrong no I think you're right and I'm thinking to like how many of these pubs are out there these Marine Corps

1295
01:49:17.90 --> 01:49:24.82
Doctional pubs it's not I mean it's not some massive numbers on a thousand of these things he's had two in the last two years

1296
01:49:24.82 --> 01:49:26.82
Yeah, like

1297
01:49:26.82 --> 01:49:28.70
There are probably common aunts that did their entire

1298
01:49:29.18 --> 01:49:35.02
Time is common up and none of these pubs came out under there watch he's done two and two for sure. Obviously this is this is clearly

1299
01:49:35.66 --> 01:49:39.34
An important thing for general brother this is a thing for him. Yeah, well learning was the first

1300
01:49:39.58 --> 01:49:45.78
New pub in how yeah, it was like a decade. It was a long time. Yes. It was a long time and this one came out one year later

1301
01:49:45.78 --> 01:49:49.46
Yeah, so this is this is wheelhouse priority for him and

1302
01:49:50.30 --> 01:49:55.98
This isn't like some big giant stretch from learning either this competing pub is not like

1303
01:49:57.18 --> 01:50:01.78
Unrelated to this is I was gonna say that we got cousins here. Yes, right?

1304
01:50:01.78 --> 01:50:07.50
We got cousins. Yes, we got learning we got competing those are cousins. There's a thread between those two a clear thread

1305
01:50:07.94 --> 01:50:09.94
they

1306
01:50:09.94 --> 01:50:12.70
The the leadership thread that's in both of these as well

1307
01:50:12.70 --> 01:50:17.14
The leadership thread is really important when you start looking at that continuum of leadership and the

1308
01:50:17.14 --> 01:50:22.06
Continuous of an influence and the the mind the way of thinking for competing and you start thinking that way of thinking for

1309
01:50:22.42 --> 01:50:30.06
Competing as also a way of leading. Yeah, that's a huge a huge asset to your toolbox of thought

1310
01:50:31.46 --> 01:50:33.46
To bring to the table as a leader

1311
01:50:34.46 --> 01:50:40.06
That's that's what has been on my mind this whole time from the beginning to the conclusion is

1312
01:50:40.06 --> 01:50:46.26
How tiny a little tweak you need to make in reading just this pub about

1313
01:50:46.98 --> 01:50:50.82
Computing which is really at least at the top level is the Marine Corps fighting against other countries

1314
01:50:51.34 --> 01:50:56.02
How tiny a tweak there is to make that this is a leadership public. This is a leadership book and

1315
01:50:56.62 --> 01:51:00.30
It applies to running a business running a team this

1316
01:51:01.30 --> 01:51:05.98
A tiny language change goes from fighting competitors to leading your own people like this is a

1317
01:51:05.98 --> 01:51:10.18
Leadership publication from beginning to end you want to think on the third one

1318
01:51:10.78 --> 01:51:14.98
One of the previous two you did the influence continuing you just pulled from that

1319
01:51:14.98 --> 01:51:21.74
I'm just listening to that just eating that up of and I remember thinking man the Marine Corps should have just said that in here

1320
01:51:21.74 --> 01:51:27.10
And yeah, they probably would have had a double the length of this thing because every time I read something

1321
01:51:27.10 --> 01:51:29.10
There's a place to go diving deeper into that

1322
01:51:29.10 --> 01:51:41.36
But despite that there's no question in my mind that they the authors just recognize and the leadership influence is sitting inside there and even the examples they pull from they're pulling all these examples if you're running a business

1323
01:51:41.36 --> 01:51:43.36
This is what you should do and so

1324
01:51:44.42 --> 01:51:47.66
There is that when you know the way broadly you see it and all things

1325
01:51:47.66 --> 01:51:54.40
I'm watching and seeing and this thing hearing you talking just making the leadership piece to that but from beginning to end that connection is as

1326
01:51:54.40 --> 01:52:01.32
Absolutely there and it doesn't take some big change and perspective to see it inside here and to learn from it totally and

1327
01:52:01.96 --> 01:52:06.36
You know the fact that the Marine Corps look they could choose a bunch of different things to

1328
01:52:07.32 --> 01:52:11.32
dive into and the fact that they dove into this

1329
01:52:12.40 --> 01:52:16.56
To run their organization and help their organization be prepared and

1330
01:52:17.68 --> 01:52:19.68
grow

1331
01:52:19.68 --> 01:52:27.000
That that's just an indication of the importance of this mindset of this way of thinking of how to compete

1332
01:52:28.52 --> 01:52:31.60
How our rivals compete and how we

1333
01:52:32.44 --> 01:52:36.20
Can't compete in a better way and

1334
01:52:36.20 --> 01:52:48.04
With that you see that softball just get tossed up echo Charles with that speaking of trying to compete better and do better echo Charles

1335
01:52:49.32 --> 01:52:51.32
Do you have any suggestions on that?

1336
01:52:51.32 --> 01:52:55.12
Yes, thank you softball not very competitive the

1337
01:52:56.60 --> 01:53:03.36
They said in a different chapter that competing in influence right is like the same thing. No, that's me. That's what I said

1338
01:53:03.36 --> 01:53:05.36
That was my whole

1339
01:53:05.36 --> 01:53:12.36
That's what really made me think we need to cover this on the podcast was hey we talk about competition

1340
01:53:12.36 --> 01:53:17.28
That's good. That's that's if we eliminated all the leadership talk and influence talk out of this podcast

1341
01:53:17.28 --> 01:53:20.32
It would have been done in three hours two hours two and a half hours

1342
01:53:20.72 --> 01:53:26.92
Okay, I guess maybe maybe half the time maybe half the time once we start a talk at about leadership and influence and

1343
01:53:27.72 --> 01:53:34.84
That that that that definitely adds to it, but yes, so we have been talking about it from a leadership perspective and an influence perspective

1344
01:53:34.84 --> 01:53:42.40
So like competing can be even at the end of the continuum or the spectrum or whatever where it's like war

1345
01:53:42.52 --> 01:53:46.68
It's like you're influencing them to submit essentially

1346
01:53:47.28 --> 01:53:51.88
Yes, I can beat you into doing what I want you to do

1347
01:53:52.28 --> 01:53:58.04
Right with which we don't want no we don't we don't even want across the threshold of violence

1348
01:53:59.44 --> 01:54:01.44
so

1349
01:54:01.44 --> 01:54:06.96
That's the leadership continuum the leadership influence continuum which by the way is also very close

1350
01:54:06.96 --> 01:54:08.44
We've related to

1351
01:54:08.44 --> 01:54:12.84
Leadership strategy and tactics a little something called the escalation of counseling

1352
01:54:13.72 --> 01:54:18.24
Which is you know, I'm doing I'm using the minimum force required. I'm just saying hey Dave

1353
01:54:18.24 --> 01:54:20.24
I know this you like today's everything. Okay, that's where it starts

1354
01:54:21.24 --> 01:54:23.88
I use the escalation of counseling by the way

1355
01:54:23.88 --> 01:54:29.36
Good thing one of the children in my household and it was good because it was a kind of where

1356
01:54:29.36 --> 01:54:32.96
You don't really it was basically hey do this chore

1357
01:54:33.28 --> 01:54:38.24
Right and or else, but I'm not the kind where I'm like hey do it now

1358
01:54:38.24 --> 01:54:42.40
You know because I want it done now. I'm just saying just you just do it right?

1359
01:54:42.40 --> 01:54:47.48
He frustrated for God. Okay, for God next day not done and it's not the kind arbitrary chore

1360
01:54:47.48 --> 01:54:50.48
It's the kind you just kind of gave away the child in question

1361
01:54:51.56 --> 01:54:53.56
The last gender review

1362
01:54:53.56 --> 01:54:57.74
The last the so busted when I was a kid

1363
01:54:57.74 --> 01:55:01.34
That kind of stuff happened to me where I forgot to do the chore

1364
01:55:01.34 --> 01:55:06.02
Then not only did I get told to do I agree that I would do it right a school dean was coming

1365
01:55:07.26 --> 01:55:13.10
You but forgot in quotes. That mean you really didn't forget you just gapped it off or did you actually forget not all the time check

1366
01:55:13.46 --> 01:55:15.46
but

1367
01:55:15.46 --> 01:55:16.46
You if

1368
01:55:16.46 --> 01:55:18.70
Yeah, like that if you get

1369
01:55:18.70 --> 01:55:23.30
Skulled it that's crossing some threshold at some point. Right. What is it the cooperish?

1370
01:55:23.30 --> 01:55:26.42
I don't know. I know there's a threshold you cross over when you start school

1371
01:55:26.42 --> 01:55:31.62
Didn't rather than hey like you all do hey you all good needy thing

1372
01:55:31.62 --> 01:55:37.22
What up? Yeah speaking of success. I've been taking joint warfare consistently for the last I don't know one month

1373
01:55:37.66 --> 01:55:39.26
Two months

1374
01:55:39.26 --> 01:55:42.22
Joint warfare is what we're taking to take care of our joints

1375
01:55:42.50 --> 01:55:52.88
We're not slack on the workhouse or taking the joint warfare and super-cruel oil also good ways to support your immunity vitamin D3 and cold war

1376
01:55:52.88 --> 01:55:54.88
Don't forget about these things

1377
01:55:54.88 --> 01:56:01.20
Very important also discipline and discipline go in a can capsules powder

1378
01:56:02.64 --> 01:56:08.80
That's it. Do you know I'm little let's just say disappointed in your whole approach on that section today

1379
01:56:08.80 --> 01:56:12.64
I don't know if you like feeling down or maybe you didn't drink enough discipline

1380
01:56:12.64 --> 01:56:17.80
I didn't feel any of that what you just said oh like my energy was all energy was low

1381
01:56:17.80 --> 01:56:23.68
I'm not like you like let me let me let me give everyone a little something to be happy about since you're

1382
01:56:23.68 --> 01:56:31.44
You know not feeling it today apparently check this out check this out if you want to get any of this stuff

1383
01:56:31.84 --> 01:56:38.92
With free shipping from origin main calm all you have to do is subscribe and that's a good call because then you're not

1384
01:56:39.56 --> 01:56:40.80
gonna

1385
01:56:40.80 --> 01:56:44.08
Miss you're not gonna look in your cupboard one day

1386
01:56:45.04 --> 01:56:51.56
Is covered in east coast word? No, okay? You're not gonna look in your cupboard one day and see that there's no joint warfare

1387
01:56:51.56 --> 01:56:58.12
There's no super krill. There's no vitamin D. It's there. It's waiting to make you healthy and strong

1388
01:56:58.52 --> 01:57:00.52
So

1389
01:57:00.52 --> 01:57:04.96
There you go. It's like you'll never need to be reminded to get it. Yeah

1390
01:57:05.36 --> 01:57:10.52
It's a very reminder it just it just shows up. Yeah, that is a big deal

1391
01:57:10.52 --> 01:57:16.84
If only if only your son could subscribe to doing chores it would just got kind of like oh like a little reminder

1392
01:57:16.84 --> 01:57:20.44
Actually, that's a good idea. So look you just establish a system

1393
01:57:20.44 --> 01:57:25.80
That you don't have to be told to do the tree. Just say hey every day

1394
01:57:26.60 --> 01:57:29.96
At this very specific time you check the trash

1395
01:57:31.20 --> 01:57:38.36
That's a system that would work good. Yeah, the challenge you have is trying to get him to recognize how that's to his benefit

1396
01:57:38.68 --> 01:57:42.92
With this other stuff. It's it's sort of undeniable that is to your benefits

1397
01:57:42.92 --> 01:57:45.80
That there's not some big negotiation going on like why this is good for you?

1398
01:57:45.80 --> 01:57:47.80
That is yeah

1399
01:57:47.80 --> 01:57:53.64
I actually have a lot more challenges than that on the last like in glad getting your spirit up a little bit anyway

1400
01:57:53.72 --> 01:57:55.72
Speaking of the

1401
01:57:55.72 --> 01:57:59.76
See you gotta look at me like that you make it worse with the with the looking at me like by the way

1402
01:58:00.16 --> 01:58:02.76
Where will me look at it? Look at the look at the

1403
01:58:03.60 --> 01:58:06.60
Anyway, so yes, they sent me a whole thing a whole

1404
01:58:08.16 --> 01:58:10.16
Package of the discipline

1405
01:58:10.16 --> 01:58:17.88
I understand and I understand what what you mean by when you're looking in the cupboard and seeing it like oh

1406
01:58:18.52 --> 01:58:22.16
Right, yeah, you know when you run low you'll get like a little sense of

1407
01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:24.52
