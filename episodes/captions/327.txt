[00:00:00] This is Jocopodcast number 327 with me, Jocco Willink.
[00:00:07] The president of the United States takes pleasure in presenting the bronze star medal
[00:00:11] to Petty Officer 3rd class, Philip Francis Torney, United States Navy, for service as set
[00:00:17] forth in the following citation.
[00:00:20] For heroic achievements in connection with the unprovoked and unexpected armed attack on
[00:00:25] USS Liberty, AGTR5 in the eastern Mediterranean on 8 June 1967.
[00:00:35] During the early afternoon hours, USS Liberty, while engaged in peaceful operations
[00:00:40] in international waters, was attacked without any warning by jet fighter aircraft and
[00:00:46] three motor torpedo boats.
[00:00:51] Liberty was subjected to intense incendiary, machine gun and rocket fire and was placed
[00:00:56] in extreme jeopardy by a torpedo hit below the waterline on the starboard side in the
[00:01:02] vicinity of the research compartment.
[00:01:06] Severe structural damage and extensive personnel casualties were incurred.
[00:01:12] Petty Officer Terny, serving as assistant on scene leader in the forward repair party, first
[00:01:18] assisted in organizing the evacuation of wounded personnel from the exposed weather decks.
[00:01:24] With complete disregard for his own personal safety, he continued to furiously expose himself
[00:01:31] to intense rocket and machine gun fire to move a fire fighting team to the bridge.
[00:01:39] He then returned to the forward weather decks to ensure that no more wounded were still
[00:01:42] exposed before going below to maintain damage control conditions of compartments below
[00:01:48] the waterline.
[00:01:50] He remained below dextering the torpedo attack and immediately afterward assisted and directed
[00:01:56] emergency repairs to minimize further flooding and damage.
[00:02:02] His aggressiveness and coolness under fire was exceptionally inspirational leadership
[00:02:07] in an hour of awesome peril.
[00:02:12] Petty Officer Terny's initiative and courageous actions were in keeping with the highest traditions
[00:02:18] of the United States Naval Service.
[00:02:23] Petty Officer Terny is authorized to wear the combat V distinguishing device.
[00:02:34] And that citation reflects an obviously intense and dire situation for a US naval ship
[00:02:40] at the USS Liberty during a vicious and determined attack.
[00:02:48] What the citation does not mention is the state or the enemy force that is conducting the
[00:02:55] attack.
[00:02:58] That is because the attack was conducted by our ally by the state of Israel.
[00:03:06] And this incident, the attack on the USS Liberty has been wrought with controversy as to
[00:03:11] how and why it happened.
[00:03:16] But there can be no controversy or no doubt about the courage and bravery of the sailors
[00:03:23] on the ship that day who suffered significant casualties.
[00:03:30] Who fought to save their shipmates and their ship and his honor to have three of those sailors
[00:03:41] with us here to share their experiences and their lessons learned.
[00:03:47] Phil Terny, Larry Bowen and Joe Meeters, gentlemen.
[00:03:54] Thank you for joining us.
[00:03:55] It's an honor to have you all out here.
[00:03:56] I appreciate you traveling and getting out here.
[00:03:59] Thank you, sir.
[00:04:00] That's about as good as it gets from an American heroys yourself, a sailor, seal,
[00:04:09] bent through it, understands what battles all about.
[00:04:14] When you have nothing to fight back with, but don't know you're willing your guts to
[00:04:20] stay alive is inspirational for all the crew.
[00:04:26] It was all hands on deck regrettably.
[00:04:30] Me and Varship made his lost their lives or severely wounded.
[00:04:34] They had to be evacuated to their stay.
[00:04:36] And we didn't get any help from our government.
[00:04:39] During the attack, after the attack, 18 hours later, we say a cruiser, a destroyer, Maddox,
[00:04:48] not the Maddox, but the Maddy.
[00:04:50] Maddy.
[00:04:51] Maddy.
[00:04:52] He came alongside in the US as Davis, and that was it.
[00:04:56] And those guys came aboard our ship on whale boats and they were actually crying to see
[00:05:05] the devastation of what they did to us.
[00:05:08] Chuck Hill was over 850 cannon rocket holes in our ship.
[00:05:12] Over 5,000 armoured piercing bullets in our ship.
[00:05:16] They dropped napong on the bridge of the ship trying to burn us to pieces.
[00:05:21] They shot our life rafts off.
[00:05:24] We only had three left.
[00:05:25] They shot them out of the water to ensure no more survivors.
[00:05:30] They sent troop carrying helicopters to finish his off.
[00:05:35] For some reason, they didn't do it.
[00:05:37] I guess they got the words.
[00:05:38] It had to gig's up.
[00:05:41] And so was this call of a mistaken identity.
[00:05:43] And that's what everybody says.
[00:05:46] It was a mistaken, oh, for so sorry.
[00:05:48] We say no to that.
[00:05:50] And it was a deliberate, primitive attack, pre-meditated attack by the people of Johnson administration.
[00:06:00] And the escrow, I believe it was named Ambassador.
[00:06:06] I mean the premier of President of Israel at that time, a small cabal of people did so much
[00:06:14] damage not only to us, and our dead shipmates, but to America.
[00:06:18] This is just on our problem.
[00:06:20] This is America's problem.
[00:06:21] In Americans like you, this is good gentleman over here and your whole staff are granted
[00:06:26] to light.
[00:06:27] God bless you for that.
[00:06:28] It means the world to me and I know it does my shipmates.
[00:06:31] It's very respectful and very honorable, you sir.
[00:06:34] Thank you.
[00:06:36] Man, it's just the story is harrowing to hear.
[00:06:41] And one of the things I want to go over today is the account that you've written of what
[00:06:46] you went through.
[00:06:48] Before we get to that, just to get a little background on all of you, just if maybe you
[00:06:53] could introduce yourselves where you came from, maybe a quick note on how you ended up in the
[00:06:58] Navy.
[00:06:59] I mean this is 1967, how you ended up in the Navy and really what your job was when you were
[00:07:04] on the liberty.
[00:07:05] Let's start with you, Joe.
[00:07:07] Okay.
[00:07:08] Well, Joe.
[00:07:09] No Larry.
[00:07:10] Oh, sorry.
[00:07:11] Let's start with you, Larry.
[00:07:12] I'm Larry Bowen.
[00:07:13] I'm the current Liberty Veterans Association president.
[00:07:17] In 1965, during the height of the Vietnam War, I got drafted.
[00:07:26] And I didn't want to be boots on the ground over from Vietnam, so I went and talked
[00:07:31] with a Navy recruiter.
[00:07:33] And he says, go take the Army physical and then we'll put you in the Navy.
[00:07:38] I was 19 years old.
[00:07:40] I didn't know if I could trust him or not.
[00:07:42] But I went, I took the physical I passed and by the end of March, I was active duty
[00:07:50] Navy going to Great Lakes Naval Training Center for Boot Camp.
[00:07:56] I became a cryptologic technician or communications technician.
[00:08:04] Shortly thereafter, Boot Camp went to A-Sgood on Empensicola, Florida.
[00:08:10] And I got my first assignment to Burmerhaven-Germany.
[00:08:15] And I thought this was a great tour.
[00:08:17] I just, you know, can't beat this.
[00:08:21] And four months later, I get orders to the USS Liberty.
[00:08:26] So this was my third cruise that I was on when we were reassigned to the Mediterranean
[00:08:35] for the Six Day War.
[00:08:38] And the mission of the Liberty, it's an interesting mission.
[00:08:42] It was really just collection of radio traffic from all over, whoever you were near.
[00:08:50] Right.
[00:08:51] And am I correct in saying that there was literally no weapons on the Liberty?
[00:08:55] Do they have any weapons at all?
[00:08:57] We had four, 50 caliber machine guns, two forward, two aft.
[00:09:02] And then we had small arms, which fell in a wreck of money, we're trying to get into
[00:09:13] when we thought we were going to have to repel borders.
[00:09:16] But the gunlock was secure and they were using, they didn't have a key.
[00:09:26] So they were trying to break the lock with a sledgehammer.
[00:09:30] So they could get in and get small arms out in case we, you know, caseels helicopters
[00:09:36] with a troops down board tried to board us.
[00:09:41] And like Phil said, the, for whatever reason, they stopped.
[00:09:49] And you know, as whether or not we had any casualties and whether or not they could help us.
[00:09:56] And a skipper told him basically, we don't need your help.
[00:10:03] Not in those terms, but you know, I made it very clear that we didn't want them.
[00:10:12] Yeah.
[00:10:13] Phil, how, how'd you end up in the Navy?
[00:10:15] That's a good question.
[00:10:17] I wasn't in school.
[00:10:20] I dropped out of school in the seventh grade.
[00:10:23] And what's the work for my dad?
[00:10:26] Where are you, where'd you go up?
[00:10:28] I grew up in Denver, Colorado.
[00:10:29] Now I live on the Western Slovakia, Colorado.
[00:10:31] I got a 48-corranged there.
[00:10:33] Me and my bride and Lisa said, no, was there.
[00:10:36] Wonderful lady.
[00:10:38] Love her a lot.
[00:10:41] We've raised our kids, but getting back to the Navy, I went to Boom Camp.
[00:10:45] And I was the most thrilled person you could ever imagine.
[00:10:50] Because I was 17 years old, I just turned 17 and joined and luckily I passed the test.
[00:10:56] But I mean, really, I was not very smart, but quite smart.
[00:11:03] And all of a sudden I get awarded to be an educational patty officer.
[00:11:11] I said, how did I get this?
[00:11:16] And my parents took it good.
[00:11:21] We got along and I'll be darned if I wasn't both outstanding recruit of my troop.
[00:11:28] And that was some of my parents.
[00:11:30] I'll never forget that.
[00:11:32] A bunch of good guys and there's old as I am now.
[00:11:36] 40.
[00:11:37] What year was that?
[00:11:39] What year did you join?
[00:11:40] 64.
[00:11:41] 1964.
[00:11:42] OK.
[00:11:43] And what was your job?
[00:11:46] My first job was being a boilerman.
[00:11:50] And machinist mate.
[00:11:51] I was on different ships.
[00:11:53] So you guys just wanted to hear, you guys just hallowed, hallowed, hallowed, that I've one of
[00:11:57] the seas with to be at nom, we have a little ammo to constellation other ships.
[00:12:03] And we would also pick up bodies that were flown to one part of the other.
[00:12:13] We take them back to seaweed bankers.
[00:12:14] We had coolers for the ammo stuff.
[00:12:17] And that was basically our deal for a couple of years.
[00:12:20] And then I got transferred to the library.
[00:12:21] I said, oh, God, this has got to be great.
[00:12:24] What a good ship.
[00:12:25] A beautiful ship.
[00:12:26] Good people.
[00:12:28] Enjoyable, good skippers.
[00:12:31] I can't say enough about the US.
[00:12:33] It's literally in your right.
[00:12:35] It was like a giant lobster out in the sea.
[00:12:40] Nobody could miss the identify that ship.
[00:12:42] So that's pretty much my naval career up to the attack.
[00:12:48] Then I got transferred to the US as mad as Taufer Gondick.
[00:12:52] Talking.
[00:12:53] So it's a bit of interesting ride.
[00:12:57] Joe, how'd you end up in the Navy?
[00:13:00] In 1966 I was in my second year of college.
[00:13:04] Didn't know what I wanted to do in my life.
[00:13:07] I didn't want ready for graduation or anything like that.
[00:13:14] I didn't want to be in the army and go to Vietnam, live in a foxhole for my four years.
[00:13:22] So I decided to join the Navy instead.
[00:13:26] So I went and joined.
[00:13:27] And then I went home and told my mom what I did.
[00:13:31] She was about to head a fit.
[00:13:33] But in hindsight she told me that it was a probably the best idea that I had the best thing
[00:13:39] I ever did.
[00:13:41] Went to boot camp in Great Lakes and I got to sign to the drill team, which was fortunate
[00:13:48] for me.
[00:13:49] It was number nine, twelve.
[00:13:50] Fortunate for me and the rest of the guys because I don't think I did more than 100
[00:13:54] pushups during my time in boot camp.
[00:14:00] And what was your rate?
[00:14:01] Well, how was the signal then?
[00:14:03] I went from boot camp to a class a signalman school in Newport, Rhode Island and then graduated
[00:14:10] from that and went to the Liberty.
[00:14:12] And I never could figure out why since the Liberty steamed independently in my rate, I had
[00:14:19] flashing light and similar four between ships.
[00:14:22] What was I doing there?
[00:14:23] Or you're going to talk to your brother.
[00:14:25] That's an interesting thing about the Liberty because of its mission.
[00:14:27] It would just go out by itself.
[00:14:30] The normal Navy ships they go out in a group, in a carrier battle group or a amphibious
[00:14:36] ready group.
[00:14:37] There's multiple ships, but you guys on the liberty you would just kind of sail around by
[00:14:41] yourselves.
[00:14:42] Exactly.
[00:14:43] On that's because of the mission.
[00:14:45] With if we were in a group, their communications would interfere with our ability to collect
[00:14:53] communications that we were trying to collect.
[00:14:56] So it was by design that we would go independently, typically off the west coast of Africa.
[00:15:05] In fact, our first port on that last cruise was we pulled in an abogent and it was in
[00:15:13] May of 1967 when we got orders to go to Rotospeen to pick up supplies and some additional
[00:15:21] people.
[00:15:22] So we were going to the Eastern Med, couldn't tell our folks or anything.
[00:15:26] They said, hey, this is all hush hush.
[00:15:32] At that time, I don't know that any of us knew what was going on in the Middle East.
[00:15:38] But yeah, that's a good point.
[00:15:39] I know when I first got in the Navy and I did a couple deployments as a seal on a ship.
[00:15:45] I mean, no, it was no internet.
[00:15:47] So you really were isolated in terms of what was going on in the world.
[00:15:52] So what was going on in the world at that time was that the Israeli six day war was happening.
[00:16:03] This is a war that took place from the fifth to the June to the tenth to June.
[00:16:07] It was Israeli versus a bunch of Arab countries, Egypt, Syria, Jordan, Iraq, Saudi Arabia,
[00:16:17] the total elements of Lebanon in there and the Israel had initiated.
[00:16:24] And there was a bunch of things that led up to this.
[00:16:25] But Israel had initiated the war with air strikes on Egyptian and Syrian airfields.
[00:16:33] They'd pretty much wiped out the Egyptian air force.
[00:16:37] On the six of June there was ground fighting that was taking place as the Israeli military
[00:16:42] pushed into the Sinai Peninsula.
[00:16:47] On the seventh of June they pushed even further into the Sinai.
[00:16:51] The Israeli Navy was probing the Egyptian Navy.
[00:16:58] There was Israeli missile boats, missile ships that were out there that engaged Egyptian
[00:17:04] shore batteries.
[00:17:05] So this is even though it's a short war, there's a lot happening in a pretty small area,
[00:17:10] as well.
[00:17:12] The Jordanians attacked and sent a lot of artillery into Jerusalem.
[00:17:21] By the seventh though, I mean Israeli, and this was just a couple days into it, Israel had
[00:17:26] gotten control over much of the West Bank.
[00:17:31] Eight to June, these things are continuing to happen.
[00:17:34] So I just wanted to kind of give some background as to what was happening when this event
[00:17:40] took place for you guys.
[00:17:43] So I was just talking about June 8th.
[00:17:47] This is when these attacks were just continuing.
[00:17:49] This is in the midst of this war.
[00:17:51] And even though, like I said, it's short, but there's a lot of fighting going on.
[00:17:55] There's 20,000 air troops were killed in this short period of time.
[00:17:58] Israel lost under a thousand, but that's still significant.
[00:18:02] So in the midst of all of that, this attack on your ship happens and Phil, you've got
[00:18:10] some personal accounts that you've written out, and these are just to me a great way
[00:18:16] of tracing how this went down from your perspective, Phil, and then Larry and Joe, you
[00:18:24] guys can give some input as well.
[00:18:25] But I just want to read some of these accounts because I always think when I write things
[00:18:30] down, they come across a little bit clearer to solidify my memories.
[00:18:33] So here's what you said about the first day and how this whole thing kicked off, Phil.
[00:18:39] You say this, my job on the morning of June 8th was sound insecurity.
[00:18:43] I would make the rounds to ensure that everything on my checklist was in good condition
[00:18:46] that the ship was watertight and ship-shaped as I reported hourly to the bridge.
[00:18:51] I did not see the first overflights by Israeli aircraft, but the other guys told me about
[00:18:56] them. We assumed that they were our friends and knowing that they were merely confirming
[00:19:01] that we were an American ship caused our moods to further light.
[00:19:06] After lunch, a general quarters drill was conducted right after that, I had to accompany
[00:19:10] another engineer to the starboard gun mount on the forecast on the folksalt that I just
[00:19:16] say that's right.
[00:19:17] You just busted a damn navy guy, totally messin' that one up.
[00:19:22] To fix the phone located there, David Skolack, my saying that right?
[00:19:26] Yes, David Skolack was the other sailor I went with and after I explained to him what
[00:19:30] needed to be done, his response was no problem, attorney.
[00:19:33] I'll get working on her.
[00:19:35] This was about five minutes before the attack at 2 o'clock PM.
[00:19:39] As we stood there, we discussed the fact that this would be the worst possible place to
[00:19:43] be in the event of an attack on the ship because the gun tub and the guy manning it would
[00:19:48] be taken out as the first priority.
[00:19:52] I said goodbye to Skolack and the gunner and made my way down the ladder to the main deck
[00:19:57] and my workstation in the ship fitters shop.
[00:20:01] As I opened the hatch to go inside, I heard an order over the PA to test the motor whale
[00:20:06] boat.
[00:20:07] Just moments later, I heard a huge explosion right next to the hatch.
[00:20:11] I had just closed.
[00:20:12] My immediate thought was that the test had gone wrong and the motor whale boat had blown
[00:20:17] up.
[00:20:18] That's how this thing kicks off.
[00:20:24] It was a normal day where you guys were able to track the wars happening where you
[00:20:30] guys could you hear explosions, could you guys see fighting taking place, were you seeing
[00:20:34] tracers in the sky at night and that kind of thing?
[00:20:37] We saw smoke from the L.I.R. area where they were attacking the Egyptian forces but we didn't
[00:20:47] hear anything and no tracers.
[00:20:50] Did you guys feel safe and secure out there?
[00:20:54] I did.
[00:20:55] Yeah, really.
[00:20:56] Yeah, absolutely.
[00:20:57] I mean, who was going to attack a flag to American ship?
[00:21:02] We saw a fan base was going to get us to be the Arabs.
[00:21:06] Besides we were told that we had an air cover in 30 minutes if we were ever attacked.
[00:21:13] Did you remember anything else that you remember about the day before it kicked off?
[00:21:19] That morning I was setting a position down in radio research one.
[00:21:23] I was an intercept operator and I had picked up some traffic that was actually part of the
[00:21:33] ground forces communicating back on Tel Aviv and my buddy Bob Eisenberg who was working
[00:21:43] in the processing and reporting center, we went to the child together at lunchtime and he told
[00:21:51] me that they were planning a big attack and it was a prolonged kind of thing where they had
[00:22:01] three different prongs to this attack, the jet strafing, the napalm and the torpedo boats.
[00:22:12] What Bob didn't tell me was who the target was, apparently they didn't spell that out in
[00:22:20] their communications.
[00:22:25] That was before we had our practice general quarters drill.
[00:22:29] I don't know if maybe Commander Lewis had sent word up to the skipper that, hey, there's
[00:22:38] things they're going to intensify here.
[00:22:40] Or maybe we ought to do a drill, but there were certainly indications and accounts that
[00:22:48] something big was going to happen.
[00:22:51] Unfortunately, we didn't know that it was us that they were targeting.
[00:22:57] Because during the morning these overflights that occurred and they started early in the
[00:23:02] morning I thought we had at least four or five overflights by Israelia aircraft.
[00:23:09] We would send our photo recon team up to the bridge to take photographs and we knew,
[00:23:16] we could see the star David on the aircraft.
[00:23:21] In my mind I felt pretty secure that our ally was going to cover us and not be the ones
[00:23:30] that was going to do the attack.
[00:23:35] Did there anything else on that?
[00:23:40] There was a signal when I was up on the top deck that was an open deck.
[00:23:45] Steel plies, sightings around the deck.
[00:23:51] I could see all of the reconnaissance aircraft come in circle this in the morning.
[00:24:00] I served quartermaster watches which I didn't like but what's it got to do.
[00:24:07] I was done in the pilot house and Larry and Lloyd Painter was the officer of the deck.
[00:24:14] He was a junior officer of the deck I believe and he was watching the radar surface
[00:24:19] search radar.
[00:24:21] He spotted the aircraft coming up or a starward side.
[00:24:26] Very low to the deck because we didn't have any air search.
[00:24:29] It was just surface search so they got slowly or quickly up our starward side turned immediately
[00:24:35] left and then left again when they got straight ahead of us and then started the attack.
[00:24:41] The Israelis claim that they conducted a series of low and slow identification runs
[00:24:46] and I don't think anybody would believe that a screaming jet would nobody could see it
[00:24:53] nobody could hear it.
[00:24:54] Those are the identification runs so they've lied about it since the outset.
[00:25:01] All right.
[00:25:08] Let's pick up Phil with your account after you hear this explosion.
[00:25:11] You say not realizing that a rocket just exploded directly outside the hatch I grabbed
[00:25:15] the handle and opened it once more to go out and investigate the trouble.
[00:25:18] I just barely put one foot outside when I felt myself grabbed by the shirt collar and
[00:25:22] violently jerked back inside.
[00:25:24] I turned and saw it was first class petty officer Dale Nies who ordered me to get back
[00:25:30] we're under attack.
[00:25:32] The general quarters alarm was then sounded and I made my way to my duty station which
[00:25:37] was which as one deck which was one deck above the mess decks.
[00:25:42] After going down the ladder I slipped and fell and found myself under trampling feet
[00:25:46] of sailors as they made their way to their stations.
[00:25:49] I rolled over to my right side to get out of the way and got on my feet and joined the stampede
[00:25:52] to get to my station as well.
[00:25:54] I got into battle dress and got my gear ready.
[00:25:57] Chief Thompson was the on scene leader as soon as I arrived he said he'd been hit and I
[00:26:02] was leaving and he was leaving to get medical care.
[00:26:05] Since I was assistant on scene leader this man I was in charge.
[00:26:10] It's all yours now, attorney.
[00:26:12] He said as he made his way down the passage.
[00:26:13] I responded back.
[00:26:14] Hey, thanks a lot, Chief.
[00:26:16] Although I was not that thrilled about this ad hoc promotion.
[00:26:21] So just for people that haven't been in the Navy tell us about general quarters what's
[00:26:25] going on.
[00:26:26] Right.
[00:26:27] General quarters is something we did aboard that ship constantly.
[00:26:34] I got aboard delivery when it just commissioned and it made one cruise and I stayed on it
[00:26:41] for the rest of them till the last one.
[00:26:44] Every captain I served on there and there was only two.
[00:26:49] McGonadol was very strict about damage control, cleanliness.
[00:26:55] He evaluated everything you did and I think that really really set us up to be at least
[00:27:04] to try to be able to save our ship and save our shipmates.
[00:27:09] It's a training we received with the good graces of God.
[00:27:17] We were able to keep the ship afloat and it just wasn't us.
[00:27:22] It was a higher power that saved us.
[00:27:25] Nobody else came to help us but it's a good lord.
[00:27:29] I believe that now and I always believed it done.
[00:27:32] Interesting Jocco.
[00:27:33] I thought when the attack started and we didn't get any help.
[00:27:39] I thought well okay this is World War III and these guys got better things to do than
[00:27:43] screw with us.
[00:27:45] The American government because they're doing their own thing.
[00:27:48] That's what I really thought because they wouldn't leave us out there alone that we were
[00:27:51] promised help and I'll be darn yeah.
[00:27:56] No help came.
[00:27:57] We were out there alone by ourselves.
[00:28:00] No armament.
[00:28:01] Our ship is burning out people all over the deck on a sleeping diet.
[00:28:07] Trying to get into racks or whatever they could just to stay alive.
[00:28:12] It was I can't say it was real chaos.
[00:28:16] It's an organized chaos just do your job and I don't do anything else but do your job.
[00:28:22] What was your job during General Quarter's?
[00:28:24] Damage control.
[00:28:25] So did you take over for you or the damage control senior guy at this point?
[00:28:30] That report, yes.
[00:28:31] Was it for that specific part of the ship or was it for the part of the ship?
[00:28:37] The other damage control was James Smith and he was fighting fires and doing all I could.
[00:28:46] In fact, that's when a Spicer got killed.
[00:28:49] He was a postal clerk.
[00:28:50] He was manning a hose.
[00:28:51] That was his General Quarter's drill and station to fight fires and Smitty just got through the hatch
[00:29:01] and then Spicer was hit.
[00:29:03] I might also had Spitty and I made third class together.
[00:29:07] E4s and he stayed in for 27 years and he came out of Lieutenant Command.
[00:29:13] He was on a lot of different ships.
[00:29:15] Spitty is a great guy.
[00:29:16] He's a great hero.
[00:29:17] All these guys are heroes.
[00:29:18] They're my alter ego.
[00:29:22] I respect these guys because they help save everybody's lives.
[00:29:26] Including mine without these people I wouldn't be alive today.
[00:29:30] Joe, what did you have to do during General Quarter's?
[00:29:32] General Quarter's as a signal man, my job was look out and look for ships to communicate
[00:29:38] with, haha.
[00:29:41] And so when the attack started, Mom and I didn't raise no fools and that signal bridge
[00:29:48] was totally open.
[00:29:50] So I stayed down in the pilot house where that was my work station basically in the pilot
[00:29:57] house.
[00:29:58] And occasionally I would look at the port wing of the bridge and look up and make sure the
[00:30:03] flag was flying.
[00:30:05] Did that a couple times and then I noticed it wasn't flying so Frank Brown and I Frank
[00:30:10] was killed while he was on the helm.
[00:30:13] Frank Brown and I took holiday colors and ended up on number four port high and I was
[00:30:18] up flying during the complete torpedo attack.
[00:30:21] And holiday colors is an even bigger flag.
[00:30:24] That's the normal biggest flag we have.
[00:30:26] And then by 13, that cracked you up.
[00:30:29] That's something like that.
[00:30:30] Yeah, 7 by 13 feet.
[00:30:34] What about you Larry, where did you go once General Quarter's kicked off?
[00:30:38] They, like I said, I had a day watch that day.
[00:30:41] So I was sounding radio research one.
[00:30:44] When they sounded General Quarter's, I moved up one deck to another position doing the
[00:30:50] same job with a cadre of other CTs.
[00:30:55] And one of, like I was an IR brancher, there was a T brancher in there.
[00:31:00] We had an O brancher.
[00:31:01] What's the IR branch T branch O branch?
[00:31:04] Okay, IR brancher was a radio man.
[00:31:06] Okay.
[00:31:07] T brancher were the technical electronic skies.
[00:31:11] We had a maintenance sky in there.
[00:31:13] We also had an IR brancher which is a linguist.
[00:31:20] And so we took positions one deck above where the torpedo hit.
[00:31:28] And when the torpedo entered, we all got blown to the overhead.
[00:31:34] Got concussions.
[00:31:35] That's probably when I got my shrapnel wounds.
[00:31:39] And you know, it wasn't until right after that that we were able to go out and start opening
[00:31:46] up the hatch and get people out from the flooding compartment below.
[00:31:50] But when Phil mentioned that we had this, you know, 29 by 39 foot of hole in the starboard
[00:31:57] side, that killed 25 of our crew members that were down in the research spaces.
[00:32:06] And you know, one of our primary concerns was getting anyone who's still alive, getting
[00:32:14] them out of there and getting them up to safety.
[00:32:19] So as soon as we got the hatch open and people started coming out of the flooding compartment,
[00:32:25] I had a secondary job of going to the front door to our compartmented spaces and handing
[00:32:33] out life jackets to everybody so that if we had to abandon ship, at least everybody
[00:32:39] would have the life for a server.
[00:32:42] And that was before we ended up at the end after everybody got out of there or if we thought
[00:32:48] everybody had gotten out of there, we'd talked on the hatch and had to close up the area,
[00:32:54] secure it.
[00:33:02] Going back to this account from Phil once again, I started my new duties by determining whether
[00:33:09] all damage control personnel were accounted for but found that several were still missing
[00:33:13] which was not surprising considering the circumstances.
[00:33:16] The torrent of explosions I was hearing above and all around me had something to do with
[00:33:20] that and the holes that began appearing everywhere around us from the rocket and can
[00:33:25] and fire were further evidence of the intensity of the attack.
[00:33:30] In the middle of the this onslaught, I caught a piece of shrapnel for inches long in my
[00:33:34] right arm just above the elbow.
[00:33:37] I pulled it out through it on the deck and moved everyone in my department to the main
[00:33:40] deck. Once there I went to the same gun tub that I visited earlier but only saw a pile
[00:33:48] of human remains, blood, hunks of human flash body parts and fragments of bone.
[00:33:54] Rick a meady, am I saying that right?
[00:33:55] Rick a meady was there with me and we knew there was no life to be saved so we moved
[00:34:01] on.
[00:34:02] Throughout this time machine gun bullets and rocket fire were raining down on us as we
[00:34:07] crouched down behind various structures leaping from one position to another.
[00:34:19] So this is I mean there's just this entire ship that's just getting raked with machine gun
[00:34:24] fire with rockets with bullets. These bullets you're talking about they're penetrating
[00:34:31] the skin of the ship and just going through creating holes immediately.
[00:34:34] Arm rehearsing bullets here exactly right, Jockel and it was it was an attack that there was
[00:34:44] no mercy. There was no explanation in our mind because we didn't know really who was
[00:34:52] doing it. They were doing it with unmarked yet aircraft until we saw the torpedo boats and
[00:34:58] they had to star David. I said, oh god they're here to help us.
[00:35:01] Now a little bit of a yell you fired five torpedoes at us. Five torpedoes and only one
[00:35:08] of him hit and it happened to hit an eye beam where we didn't take the full explosion
[00:35:13] and it was more but not word deal but as Larry was saying 25 of America's most intelligent
[00:35:22] secret personnel in the world all of them top secret were instantly blown to bits and it's
[00:35:32] just something you can't describe to see your own ship makes like that and you know they're
[00:35:36] down there and once it got killed on deck we already put them in body bags and the ones
[00:35:43] that were at playing to life. Doc Heafer took care of them. I helped in operations all these
[00:35:51] other guys did what they could to help people it was a unified ship and it was two different
[00:35:57] cruise more dead ship to spokes and us. So we were the idiots and these were the smart guys
[00:36:04] and it's too bad. I mean that with all due respect, believe me all due respect but these guys
[00:36:10] here took the front of the dams and you know what, Jacko they didn't they didn't lose
[00:36:14] their duty stations they could have run out of there but they stayed there doing their duty
[00:36:21] and gave the lies for it and it was inspirational. You think about that and then the torpedo hit
[00:36:32] the torpedo gunboats would come up alongside of us in fire at our fire fighters, stretchers
[00:36:39] of bears, anybody on deck they're that close, shoot nests you know I mean out of us and it's
[00:36:47] uh it never occurred to me as I've said many times that how another country or human being could
[00:36:56] do that to their own supposedly friends and get by with it and then come back and say have you
[00:37:04] cash a lease have you any cash I just fly it all over the decks commander castle was in one
[00:37:10] of the it's a really helicopters he was as it had to at the shade there in Israel he dropped
[00:37:16] a card was his name on it and the brackets is have you casualties and I thought to myself
[00:37:22] my god how could this I mean the guys got to be able to see and it just everybody was
[00:37:30] astounded by that the captain told it get to helicopter tell the whole way for my ship get it out
[00:37:36] of your now and they did and we were all alone our country but promises help we expected help
[00:37:45] the jitter a craft for callback by Worsington Mac D'Ambara and LBGA and all his cronies
[00:37:51] uh including uh Admiral McCain used a commanding officer of European forces Europe and uh he was
[00:38:04] a huge part of the cover up the important bit choir only when seven days seven days it was wrapped up
[00:38:11] it was all pretty predetermined what the outcomes going to be mistaken identity they say they paid
[00:38:16] six million dollars or ten million or whatever the crew was compensated they compensated
[00:38:22] the most of the crew 200 bucks for their their clothes or maybe they're whatever but the average
[00:38:31] was 200 bucks the most seriously guy said got wounded days and served every penny they got
[00:38:36] but it wasn't nothing like they said it was and it was our money they were given right back to us
[00:38:41] so it is will never put out a dime you nine states paid for it all and they sold our ship for
[00:38:50] measly a couple hundred thousand dollars they cut up and raised their blades to make sure
[00:38:54] the evidence was gone but they didn't they didn't count on us for fifty five years telling you guys
[00:39:03] hey you're you're lying to the American public and you're not going to get by with it that's why
[00:39:07] we're here now America's two great two great of a country is it is service nation as you well know
[00:39:15] you you've been there you know what it's all about and you didn't get you know nobody turned
[00:39:22] the back on you because you had backup your own men and you know to the last man it's it's not
[00:39:29] over till it's over but it was like that way it was us it's not over till it's over we're so
[00:39:35] large the ship didn't roll over and the next day they got there and like I see
[00:39:42] massing the Davis is guys before the ship just in tears it was the hated see their own shipmates
[00:39:51] get torn apart like that it would no help it coming to find out you know I think the Navy
[00:39:58] did try to help us but the government the higher ups wouldn't wouldn't come to our aid and it's
[00:40:04] pretty sad this one pilot he's in this film on one by the way I wanted to give you this
[00:40:09] job I think you've seen this haven't you I have not seen that no okay this is a sacrificing liberty
[00:40:16] go to sacrifice and liberty dot com sacrifice and liberty dot com this is a four part series
[00:40:23] it's one of the best series has ever been done and truthful it's all about many survivors
[00:40:31] in this film telling the truth and it's my great honor and pleasure to give this to you
[00:40:36] and I hope you you watch it to spread the word jacco thank you thank you
[00:40:44] one one thing that should be noted about the 25 men killed by the torpedo is that they probably
[00:40:50] would have survived the attack if lb j hadn't recalled the aircraft that aircraft were already in
[00:40:56] in flight probably halfway to the liberty and would have driven off the the torpedo attack
[00:41:02] if they had been allowed to continue just to give people some more
[00:41:10] some more context as to what was actually happening for you guys your account fill as this is
[00:41:18] taking place you say this dead bodies were littered everywhere but there were also wounded bodies
[00:41:26] that we knew had to be found and saved if possible between valleys of bullets and rockets we
[00:41:30] darted out from safe cover grab the wounded men wanted a time drag them across the deck and assisted
[00:41:36] them down the hatch others from down below took them from there and moved them to the mess halls
[00:41:41] where they could be treated they took us at least 15 minutes to clear the decks of those who
[00:41:45] were still alive and could be saved about 25 men all together one of the worst cases I saw was
[00:41:52] time Tom Riley a boasts and mate who was on his back and bleeding from multiple wounds and it's covered
[00:41:57] with gray paint which might have saved his life since it became a giant bandage
[00:42:02] so that's the that's kind of the situation that took place where you that's what you
[00:42:09] received the bronze star for was that action going out into into the into the fire to try and recover
[00:42:15] wounded guys you continue here after all the wounded had been recovered I went to the log room
[00:42:22] the location of damage control central I saw and some John D scout there my superior officer
[00:42:27] who is burning documents the standard procedure in US military after briefing him and discussing
[00:42:32] the situation for a few minutes he ordered me to return to the deck to further assess the
[00:42:36] damages and put out any fires that were still burning on the way back I saw many wounded men
[00:42:41] bloody and moaning begging me for help but as I had no medical training there was not much
[00:42:46] I could do to help relieve their pain I got to the bridge and saw a commander at Nagel was badly
[00:42:54] wounded in the leg but still in command rocket and cannon holes were everywhere and burning
[00:43:01] napalm was dripping through the holes into the bridge compartment there were CO2 canisters that
[00:43:07] were not effective in fighting that kind of fire and I requested a team with water hoses but that
[00:43:12] didn't work either since the fire hoses had been shot up just like everything else I told the
[00:43:17] captain that I would return with some better equipment to fight the fires and he calmly replied
[00:43:22] do what you can sailor he was always very professional and stoic even under these incredibly
[00:43:29] violence surreal circumstances so you have napalm dripping through the holes onto the bridge I mean
[00:43:39] that's just crazy to think about it is crazy it is crazy it's a war crime
[00:43:50] dropping it on dropping it on us they wouldn't they they couldn't shoot us up so they tried to burn us
[00:43:59] up and the fire is just basically burn out because we couldn't put them out we didn't have the
[00:44:06] equipment COT CO2 was all gone everything was been had been utilized so it was we could have gotten
[00:44:14] water from the engine room they they could have pumped this water but there was nothing we could do
[00:44:21] with it because the hoses were 99% of our shot up they're all gone and you have that in interaction
[00:44:28] with the captain captain of the conical he sounds like a stoic guy one thing I remember about
[00:44:36] captain of the conical and I remember distinctly is when I was in the pilot house that's where I
[00:44:40] stayed during 99% of the attack and bullets were flying and and and napalm smoking all that stuff
[00:44:47] he was very calmly walking back and forth asking for a cup of coffee he says can I have a cup of coffee please
[00:44:56] she's
[00:45:00] um this is this is just chaos it's chaos put on our part it's organized chaos because we were
[00:45:10] so well trained we knew what we were supposed to do and we did it without thinking that's what
[00:45:16] all the training was for you say this on on my way to the bridge I looked at my good friend
[00:45:25] Francis Brown a third class quarter master who's helping steer the ship he was one of my best
[00:45:30] friends on the ship and we hung out together in better times playing card strength if you
[00:45:33] beers and joking together we just locked eyes and communicated silently that we might not make it
[00:45:38] through this one I went off to find more CO2 canisters and I ran back towards the bridge
[00:45:44] falling in the process which caused the CO2 canister to fly out of my hands and crashed down the
[00:45:48] deck with a bang as soon as I got up I saw that I saw what it caused me to slip and fall
[00:45:57] it was blood on the deck that hadn't been there moments before when I left the bridge it was my friend
[00:46:03] Francis Brown's blood who had caught a machine gun bullet or a piece of shrapnel in the back of his
[00:46:08] head and his blood was everywhere his eyes were closed but his face was swelled up like a balloon
[00:46:15] there was something that no human being should ever have to see especially when it's a good friend of yours
[00:46:19] in a little while after going below deck and seeing more scenes like that I looked like a slaughterhouse
[00:46:29] with a cacophony of wailing and desperation in the background the wounded men kept begging me
[00:46:34] to help them and it was frustrating for me not to be able to do that because I had to move
[00:46:38] them from the passageways into the mess hall so they could get the medical attention they needed
[00:46:43] finally the jet attack was over and I went back to the top deck and then saw Torbito boats coming
[00:46:50] at us at a high rate of speed and now I saw who it was the star of David Flags flying above
[00:46:57] these boats was quite a surprise and at first I assumed they were coming to our rescue
[00:47:02] the delusion only lasted a minute because I then saw the splash of several torpedoes
[00:47:08] that they dropped into the water as they headed towards us did you know they were torpedoes
[00:47:17] I mean did you identify that it seems like that's such a if I would have seen his railie boats
[00:47:22] I thought oh they're friendly oh something just went in the water what could that be did you
[00:47:25] actually know they were torpedoes at that point I did jog because I could see the
[00:47:31] trail in the water oh I saw the two go out I don't know where the other they're fired they're
[00:47:37] say anywhere from five to six torpedoes the general rule is fired but I mean five or six what
[00:47:42] difference is it make now but the two that went after I saw those I didn't I don't know where the
[00:47:49] other ones they could have been after or forward but I do know that one that one did hit and
[00:47:57] that's that's when the ship started listening badly to the star of its side and it just
[00:48:04] looked like this one first and the ship was picked up this is where so so before the torpedo hit
[00:48:10] you say the four torpedoes launched almost simultaneously they had had they hit us the
[00:48:14] liberty would have sunk immediately and the rest of the world history would have been written quite
[00:48:18] definitely those four had miraculously all missed the fifth one was fired and it was immediately
[00:48:22] obvious that it could not be out maneuvered that countdown began we were warned to prepare for a torpedo
[00:48:29] hit and we hunkered down in torpedo attack mode this meant bending your knees and elbows putting
[00:48:33] your hands against the bokeh and relaxing your neck and all of that is made nearly impossible as
[00:48:39] your thoughts of imminent death take over your mind so there was a time period where the fourth
[00:48:44] torpedo launched or sorry the fourth or fifth or whatever it was there's one that you could tell
[00:48:49] that it was going to hit you could you see you could see it in the water coming your way
[00:48:53] no I couldn't see it I was a low decks one deck below the main deck when they counted off on the
[00:48:59] one MC or something yes the captain said prepare for torpedo hit starvation side and
[00:49:08] then we knew there's just a matter of time and it hit and I was thinking to myself
[00:49:15] if this ship goes down I'm going to go down with it because I'm not going to get in the water
[00:49:19] and try to stay alive and let them guys shoot me in the water I'd better go down to ship and that
[00:49:26] was why I intentionally was going down but the ship just just we're actually stopped listing
[00:49:36] how what do you think and Larry as this as you're hearing the countdown comes starbird side
[00:49:42] that's got to be absolutely horrifying it was and we were internal to the ship so I mean we had no
[00:49:49] place to run we were I'd been sitting there our general quarters positions doing our job when you said
[00:49:57] prepare for torpedo attack and we got off our position got ourselves up against the bulkhead
[00:50:05] and squatted down and just brace yourself but you know you're not you never really prepared
[00:50:13] for something like that you just you don't know whether or not it's going to hit right where you're at
[00:50:21] or somewhere else we were above the water line but we were right against the bulkhead that separated
[00:50:30] our calm spaces and our P&R spaces which is the area that the torpedo came into so
[00:50:37] the explosion itself was definitely in for us and like I said we got blown to the overhead
[00:50:49] got concussions and probably the strap no wounds that we received after that
[00:50:56] but you immediately scrambled to your feet to try and help your fellowship mates that are down
[00:51:04] below we didn't know how badly the torpedo damaged that area but when we opened up the hatch we could
[00:51:12] tell you know I mean water was rising and people were scrambling to try and get up the ladder so
[00:51:18] that they could get out but yeah it was nerve-racking absolutely nerve-racking
[00:51:27] to say that we were scared to death I think would be an other statement. Joe when you heard
[00:51:36] brace for torpedo impact where were you what were you thinking. I was on the port wing of the bridge
[00:51:42] looking up make sure the flag was flying and when I heard that brace for torpedo attack I just hit the
[00:51:49] deck and you know not knowing what a torpedo would do I just felt it hit and I was lifted off the
[00:51:57] deck just to instant. Phil you saying the account when the explosion came it was literally
[00:52:07] deafening I'd been directly above the point where it hit only about eight feet away and the explosive
[00:52:13] percussion blew out my ear drums an injury that never completely heals we were all
[00:52:19] instantly airborne because the ship itself was picked up out of the water and then it came back
[00:52:24] down and bounced back up and down a few more times nearly capsizing in the process.
[00:52:31] The new moaning and groaning was not coming from the wounded men but was now coming from the wounded
[00:52:35] ship as the rush of sea water flooded into the ship. Since the ship itself did not blow up
[00:52:43] that meant the torpedo did not hit the engine room because that cold sea water hitting the
[00:52:47] boilers would have caused the ship to be cut in half and both halves would have gone to the
[00:52:51] bottom within minutes. And since Scott instructed me to determine where the torpedo had hit
[00:53:02] so with Rick a mediat my side we went down to the communications spaces where the spooks worked.
[00:53:08] I banged on the steel door with my fire axe since I did not have a code to open it and a voice told
[00:53:13] me that I was not authorized to enter the spaces. Rick and I told whoever was on the other side
[00:53:18] to go to hell saying that we were authorized to go wherever we had to to keep the ship afloat.
[00:53:24] I told the person on the other side that if they did not open the door I would beat it off
[00:53:27] its hinges with my axe. That's a crazy story so these guys freaking the ship got hit with a
[00:53:34] torpedo and you go open up this damn door and they go hey you're not authorized.
[00:53:39] Yeah it was crazy it was really crazy and when we got down there we went to the hatch that he
[00:53:49] closed to make sure everything was watertight and everything and I grabbed a hatch it had two
[00:53:56] different hatches of big one in and a small skull hatch. I opened it up very slowly and I could hear air
[00:54:02] coming out so I do not want to water and I'll be darn two or three other guys for out there
[00:54:08] bang and try to get out and they came out and what a beautiful sight to see in my life.
[00:54:17] Yeah you say suddenly the door opened I went to scuttle hatch to scuttle hatch and turned it
[00:54:21] then opened it very slowly I heard air escaping in our direction which meant that the
[00:54:24] compartment was not completely filled already but was filling. Just as I opened it I heard
[00:54:30] frantic banging on the other side so I turned the wheel as fast as I could and Sergeant Bruce
[00:54:34] Lockwood United States Marine Corps came scrambling out while pulling another sailor safety as well.
[00:54:40] A Median I grabbed the two and yanked them out of the hole and since Scott came up
[00:54:44] carrying a battle lantern and ordered me to give him my belt. I did as he asked and then he used it
[00:54:53] to lower the lantern into the water to look and check for any more signs of life. After a few moments
[00:54:59] we looked at each other and he asked what I thought. Sir I said I think we had better seal her up.
[00:55:17] So that's one of those moments where you know as a leader you got to make a the hardest decision
[00:55:25] that a person could have to make which is we don't know who else is down below we know that this
[00:55:31] this is filling up with water and when we seal this hatch we're sealing their fate but in order
[00:55:36] to save the ship that's the decision they have to make. Absolutely there's a very difficult decision
[00:55:43] but it was pretty instantaneous as soon as that decision was made I mean it was done but with
[00:55:51] wood preerodically go back and check listen but it was all over so Scott didn't have a chance
[00:56:00] it was lucky enough he got out and many more but it was just I mean to think about
[00:56:11] 25 your ship makes down there and I didn't know how many got killed at that time down there
[00:56:15] but to think that they went through that and what we went through a bug deck they didn't know
[00:56:24] what was going on below deck they didn't have a clue but like I said earlier these guys
[00:56:34] they didn't abandon their duty stations and what kind of courage is I take to save the
[00:56:40] low decks in the CT spaces on the starboard side and take what they were going to get and they
[00:56:48] did break brave one of them and that's why we're here there are dead ship mates they can't speak
[00:56:56] but we can speak for them and we've been doing that forever trying to get the truth out
[00:57:02] but our government once it's sealed the stay sealed is so disposable now again it's not
[00:57:08] it's not a guess the Jews it's not a guess Americans they just got fed lies and we're here to
[00:57:16] say hey who are I witnesses are you going to believe the Israeli version the board of
[00:57:21] inkware version which is a total BS are you going to believe I witness this like us now I think
[00:57:28] the American public is smart now especially with what's going on in the world now to see that
[00:57:32] how powerful a government can be if they want to silence you it's gotten so bad that the US
[00:57:41] Navy curator and the US Navy historian wrote the official government version of the attack and he
[00:57:49] based it entirely on the Israeli version wow well more people are going to hear here this version
[00:58:00] then that version how you like that go and back to the account now the torpedo boats began firing
[00:58:12] it us with machine guns shooting anything that moved including firefighters and stretcher bears
[00:58:18] one of the guys I was pulling to safety got hit right above the knee with a 50 caliber slot
[00:58:22] causing explosion of blood and bone I took off my shirt and tied the sleeves around the top of his leg
[00:58:27] as tight as I could to stop the bleeding we got him down to the mess decks and untied the
[00:58:31] turnic it for just a few seconds so that they wouldn't be forced to amputate the leg later
[00:58:35] then we retided before leaving the area a median I went back up to the main deck and saw
[00:58:40] that that the gunners on the torpedo boats were now shooting at the ship on the waterline
[00:58:45] aiming in the direction of the boilers and from merely 35 yards away clearly they were trying
[00:58:51] now to blow up the ship by hitting the boilers and causing a huge explosion that their last
[00:58:55] torpedo had failed to accomplish throughout the course the torpedo boat attacked they circled
[00:59:01] the ship like voltiers at as close as a hundred feet to suggest that they might have missed the
[00:59:06] huge lettering on both sides of the bow in ten foot high letters as well as the USS Liberty
[00:59:13] lettering on the stern seems impossible
[00:59:16] and you're sitting there seeing these guys just lay into you with 50 caliber machine guns
[00:59:27] from a hundred yards away yes sir and nothing to fight back with
[00:59:33] the are willing and which and the pleasure of taking another breath is what kept us all
[00:59:41] going and pretty fortunate to be here jacco i saw one of the torpedo boats a lot closer than
[00:59:50] a hundred yards one of the miles on the port wing of bridges I spent a lot of time out there
[00:59:55] making sure the flag was flying and I saw one of the torpedo boats sail very slowly at our
[01:00:01] port support side I didn't see him fire anything but I did notice the crew on the on the torpedo
[01:00:08] boat motion up to the signal bridge up to that area so they can see the flag and then they just
[01:00:15] sail off and continue to attack how much time had passed between the initial
[01:00:23] strafing runs from the aircraft to the torpedo attack and is this an hour has gone by two hours
[01:00:31] or approximately two hours some people save more some people probably say less
[01:00:35] but to do that type of damage and in a few moments like these really said it just took a
[01:00:44] little while they only said they had only three aircraft that attacked us and there was
[01:00:51] probably twenty aircraft so to attack us to do that kind of damaging that's for the time it's just
[01:00:57] when you think back three airplanes can't carry the munitions would take to put over eight hundred
[01:01:07] fifty cannon rocket holes in the ship drop napalmons and just it doesn't make sense
[01:01:15] so as all this is going on you say all of the sounds of these machine guns and the sheer
[01:01:21] hell taking place might have been the reason why there was some controversy of whether commander
[01:01:26] mechanical ordered all crew prepared to abandon ship but I heard that order probably because
[01:01:32] he felt that there was no possibility at that point we could save the ship
[01:01:42] he was probably not aware yet that nearly all the life boats were either destroyed by
[01:01:46] rockets gunfire napalm that there were only three left and I personally put one of them into the
[01:01:51] water as I watched all three and flate only to see them immediately shot up two sank but one of
[01:01:56] them was taking a board one of the boats as a trophy that capped the series of horrors I witnessed
[01:02:01] that day and told me as clearly as anything else that the purpose of the attack was not just
[01:02:06] to cripple the ship and take it out of commission so that it could not ease drop on communications
[01:02:10] but to actually sink our ship the active destroying our life boats was an unmistakable
[01:02:16] sign that they wanted no survivors left to tell anyone what had happened Lord Painter testified
[01:02:22] about that he he witnessed the machine gunning of the life rafts and he testified about that during
[01:02:27] the US Navy Court of Inquiry but if you get a copy of the Court of Inquiry his test of money has
[01:02:33] been removed not redacted removed from the record what do you think and when you hear a band
[01:02:41] and ship what are you thinking about Larry did you hear that call I did I was had a secondary
[01:02:49] duty station at that point our our fan tail phone talker had taken a rocket hit
[01:02:58] seriously wounded and he was down in the dispensary I was back on the fan tail as a phone
[01:03:05] talker I had a first-class petty officer Jeff Carpenter saw me getting some fresh air while
[01:03:14] puddle behind a a wench and he said bo and go back and be the phone talker and
[01:03:23] I saw the torpedo boats and when I heard this skipper say you know prepared to abandon ship
[01:03:31] I was I was sinking to myself you know I mean this this is it you know I mean there the right
[01:03:39] there are they I can shoot every one of us in the water you're trying to decide whether or not
[01:03:45] you you've got a chance of jumping overboard and and swimming for or going down with a ship like
[01:03:52] Phil talked about and of course I stood my ground and waited but that was about the same time that I saw
[01:04:01] under that and a fried aircraft approaching from the starboard side and it was helicopter
[01:04:10] and they were coming out at that point to find out whether or not we had any casualties whether
[01:04:16] or not they can provide any kind of assistance and so obviously we didn't have to have been
[01:04:25] in ship but you know you scared the death again you don't know you've got nowhere to run
[01:04:35] I mean we were like ducks in a barrel and I just opened fire and you know we we had no
[01:04:45] way to defend ourselves and you guys mentioned this already but just to just to reiterate
[01:04:54] there was some heroic activity to place for people for some of your shipmates to get
[01:05:00] onto the deck of the ship and string up a long wire antenna and send out an SOS message
[01:05:04] and that actually made it to to six feet which was you know like I talked earlier about big
[01:05:10] groups of ships and you guys traveled solo but normally the US Navy travels and big groups of ships so
[01:05:16] that was the six fleet is one of these big groups of ships had an aircraft carrier and whatnot
[01:05:21] and they actually received the SOS that you guys were on travel under attack and and talk me through
[01:05:28] about what you know about how that how the response the rescue response got shut down
[01:05:35] very good question we didn't learn quite a while exactly why it went forward but
[01:05:50] it just seemed like nobody really cared about us you know nobody
[01:06:00] sued in the present he's the one that got a visit this mess L.B.J. State L.B.J.
[01:06:07] and his minions but I never thought I never thought that the greatest fighting force in the
[01:06:15] world would leave this behind but they didn't they they wanted to come help us that's why
[01:06:21] Captain Tully got fired they took his command away because he immediately launched aircraft out was
[01:06:25] but twice and he was a captain Tully was someone on the US S.R. Toga they received the signal
[01:06:33] that you all were in trouble and he said okay we got sailors in trouble we got US Navy ship in
[01:06:39] trouble we're gonna go help him and he launches aircraft to go help yes before they even before they
[01:06:45] left the horizon the ship they would recall back thanks to L.B.J. and McNamber
[01:06:53] and I believe that we've set up from the Gidgo I don't know if it was a year before six months
[01:07:01] before whatever but the front let's say 15 was all about six five six the June 15th I mean
[01:07:12] yeah six of June on the 15th day the war response to start but they started early that's why
[01:07:18] they rushed this out of out of avidjan to get to the area just as fast as we could I mean
[01:07:25] that whole ship was still in this fast it was shaken we had they took the governor's off the
[01:07:31] engines and we were on our way flying but everybody was apprehensive we how we didn't even know
[01:07:39] from the radio signals I mean what was going on the Middle East but there was a war going on
[01:07:44] here we go and we look out and here we are and sailing up and down the coast like we usually
[01:07:49] did in Africa that was our only position in Africa was just sail up and down the coast and
[01:07:54] collect intelligence like everybody else does but when we got on scene and you could see as Joe
[01:08:02] Manchard before the black smoke coming up from from the attacking forces is rules going into
[01:08:11] the sign I it was I thought what Jesus man I'd hate to be over there I'd never knew it was
[01:08:19] coming to us and we were the intended target to sink in my view and I think a lot of other guys
[01:08:26] too is sink it I blame it on NASA and World War III they're broken out because the Russian
[01:08:34] suffers they're ready to ready to nuke Israel and they our government sent bombers to bomb
[01:08:47] the Arab states and never recalled within seconds of a catastrophe of a nuclear war
[01:08:55] yeah so I read that as well that we had launched nuclear weapon armed aircraft as a response to
[01:09:06] what was happening and then those got recalled as well yes sure exactly if you look at the
[01:09:14] this tactics used by the Israelis during the attack they started with unmarked aircraft or
[01:09:22] they jammed our radios on both US Navy tactical and international maritime distress frequencies
[01:09:28] they used unmarked aircraft they used the napal on the drive the ships crew down below
[01:09:34] decks brought interpeeta boats to with six torpedoes total luckily only one hit and then he
[01:09:40] labored assault troops it was obvious to me and most people that their intention was to sink the
[01:09:48] ship and kill old any survivors speaking of that the the he-low-born assault troops here we go
[01:09:58] shortly after the boats left the scene from far off in the distance but closing in fast came the
[01:10:04] unmistaker will want want want want sound of a very large troop carrying helicopter approaching the
[01:10:10] ship on the starboard side now the one MC system blared all ships personnel prepared to rebel
[01:10:17] repel borders so now after all other weapons were brought to bear on our ship and failed the
[01:10:24] sinker we were about to be bordered by Marines armed with sub machine guns after the only
[01:10:29] machine guns on the ship had been destroyed in the wave of first attacks even if we could get to
[01:10:35] them in time the only other guns we had on the ship were small arms pistols and a couple of
[01:10:39] shot guns that we might use to set up a last line of defense a median eye tried to open the
[01:10:45] locker with our fire axes since our master at arms who is the only one with a key was not to be found
[01:10:51] even after beating that lock nearly pieces we could not break it the commandos on board the helicopter
[01:11:00] above appeared to be ready to repel on to our ship ready for close quarters combat with a bunch of
[01:11:05] defenses for drag-led sailors worn out from two hours of sustained attacks it would have been a
[01:11:11] turkey shoot but we were not to about to go down without a fight for our lives had they proceeded they
[01:11:17] could have murdered the entire crew and then proceeded to use whatever explosives they had to
[01:11:21] guarantee the ship's destruction as the helicopter hovered overhead no more than 75 feet away
[01:11:28] I locked eyes with one of the Marines these are Israeli Marines who is sitting on the floor of the
[01:11:34] helicopter his legs were hanging out he had one foot on the skid below as he waited for an order
[01:11:39] to repel down to the ship's deck and finish us off as I stood on the deck of my bloody and
[01:11:45] battered ship I thought about everything that had happened over the course of that afternoon
[01:11:49] about my good friends Francis Brown and David Skolack and all the other men whose remains were
[01:11:55] strewn all over the ship the only two-eyed left was my middle finger and I used it to let him know
[01:12:02] what I thought of him in the rest of his team he simply gave me a smile and returned the gesture
[01:12:17] and then they they backed off right that's they they didn't land they they flew away
[01:12:23] they just took they just took off york on it was it was a victory for us our first victory of the whole
[01:12:35] mess that was they're not coming aboard because they could they could have easily in fact they
[01:12:40] could come back that night and got us and for some reason they didn't do it because they could have
[01:12:46] gotten by with it very easy all the kids of ship broke apart the Israeli said that Derib's did it
[01:12:52] and I think we better go get to your I think we better just go get them that's just that was the
[01:12:56] whole is a land grab for Israel and in a power grab for LBGA to keep these war machine going in
[01:13:04] Vietnam and it's not like you guys got helped quickly you say this it's 18 hours a hell
[01:13:15] to call it a long night is a big understatement none of us slept for two reasons first we
[01:13:20] were afraid of the dark not like little kids but rather because we knew that criminals
[01:13:23] prefer the cover of darkness when doing their dirty work those responsible for the previous
[01:13:27] days attack might return to the scene of the crime to finish what they had failed to do earlier
[01:13:35] second we didn't know if the ship would even stay together although we were not sure of the
[01:13:39] exact size the whole in the starboard side we knew that it was big very big it was a lot of work
[01:13:45] that wouldn't be needed just to keep the ship afloat and moving away from the dangerous zone
[01:13:50] and with all the men killed or wounded only a skeleton crew remained to do this
[01:13:56] those of us who did survive were glad of that of course but we all felt an enormous amount of
[01:14:02] survivors guilt why me why us we asked ourselves silently why had we been spared while others had not
[01:14:10] the dead included two of my good friends Francis Brown who shot in the head with a 50
[01:14:14] caliber machine gun round and his brain splattered all over the bridge and David Skolok who had
[01:14:20] who had been with just minutes before the attack he was also called the machine gun fire
[01:14:24] and had been blown to pieces too many to count I went to the mess deck to see if I could help with
[01:14:29] the severely wounded men as soon as I entered the sheer mass of human suffering moved me so much
[01:14:35] to emotion that my knees got weak but I dared not let it show as I went from broken man to
[01:14:42] broken man asking what I could do to help him feel more comfortable what was the total ship's crew
[01:14:49] 294 two says the crew is either wounded or dead what were you doing throughout the night
[01:14:58] Larry a little bit of the same to fill was just talking about one to the mess decks to
[01:15:04] help relieve the corpsman wheel ahead one ships officer you know the skip of the doctor
[01:15:15] is the doctor doctor key for and and then two corpsmen a second class and a third class per
[01:15:22] the officer so I'm an eagle scout I had some first aid background not that it was going to
[01:15:31] do much for some of the maimed bodies that were laying there in a mess decks but like Phil said
[01:15:37] you're there to try and comfort them and you know just just talk to him I was actually
[01:15:47] providing some kind of an ointment to their wounds you know the corpsman would give me something
[01:15:55] and say go you know wipe this wound here or whatever and so I was doing that
[01:16:05] didn't get any sleep that night I think the main reason was I wanted to stay awake in case something
[01:16:12] happened and that that bulkhead gave way because we would have had a band and ship as quickly as
[01:16:19] we could I still have my life fast son I wasn't going to give that up but I was I was not alone
[01:16:31] I mean there were a lot of us walking wounded I was I was wounded but I didn't realize that I had
[01:16:39] the strap and the wounds in my thigh because you're adrenaline is pumping so so fast that and you're
[01:16:48] taking care of others so I had blood from trying to take care of John Spicer and you know working
[01:16:57] with some of the other wounded that my my dongries were just kind of blood soaked and I didn't find
[01:17:04] out until I don't know I guess a day or two later when one of the doctors from one of the other
[01:17:10] ships was up in the dispensary and they were you know evaluating us to determine whether or not
[01:17:17] we'd sustained any injuries and of course I had a drop trial when he said how did you get those
[01:17:24] you know scars on your leg there and strap no wounds I said I don't know I was to bend
[01:17:32] there in the torpedo attack but as far as working through the night we did whatever we could to
[01:17:41] try and you know keep keep everyone calm it wasn't chaotic I mean they weren't there might have
[01:17:48] been some mone in here and there but it wasn't a lot of screaming and yelling or anything like
[01:17:54] that everybody realized hey there's still alive and we're gonna get out of this we kept thinking
[01:18:03] that we're gonna get some support but nothing ever came. What about you Joe what were you doing
[01:18:11] throughout that night throughout that night does the signal when I was up on the signal bridge
[01:18:15] looking for ships and if it's someone might be coming to help you either way and if I saw a
[01:18:25] light moving along in the sky I don't care how high I but was I always had my little all disflashing
[01:18:32] lamp and tried to signal it I knew it was futile but I had to try it because all the other
[01:18:38] signal lights are in this right. Going back to the account here from you Phil as I was doing this
[01:18:47] commander Philip Armstrong the ship's executive officer called my name I thought that his condition
[01:18:53] was critical but he was active in alert and seemingly in little pain he asked me for a cigarette
[01:18:58] so I lit one and put one in his mouth form he asked me many questions about the number of dead
[01:19:03] and wounded and the captain's condition while I heard the agony of the men all around us. I left him
[01:19:10] for a few minutes to try and find anything to help comfort the men and by the time I returned
[01:19:14] to check on commander Armstrong to my great shock and sadness I found that he had just died.
[01:19:21] Then I went to the wardrobe the mess hall for the officers there I saw another one of my friends
[01:19:27] Clary Bent Gary Blanchard and listed Seaman who's front showed no signs of wound but he was lying
[01:19:33] in a puddle of his own blood that seemed to be getting bigger by the second. He asked me to
[01:19:40] remove his socks because his feet were on fire I did as he asked then he asked if he was going to
[01:19:46] make it I could do no more than shake my head no. I always hated myself for not lying to him
[01:19:54] or at least ignoring the question and changing the subject but I did hope that my response allowed
[01:20:01] him the chance to make peace with his maker before the final curtain. These four men were among
[01:20:09] the nearly three dozen killed that day many of whom I'd never gotten a chance to know.
[01:20:16] I had met the ship's doctor I had met the ship's only doctor there in the wardrobe
[01:20:21] Dr. Richard Kifer I'm saying that right Kifer Kifer he came over and began to operate on Gary
[01:20:28] however quickly became clear that it was too late as soon as he opened him up he then
[01:20:33] had to put stitches in him to hold him together before Doc moved on to his other numerous
[01:20:39] patients all of whom desperately needed his attention. If anyone aboard that ship
[01:20:45] deserved the congressional metal varner it was Doc Kifer. As time went on we went about
[01:20:57] our regular duties now modified because of the precarious condition of the ship we were still
[01:21:01] unsure why we'd been attacked and by whom is Rayleigh flags have been seen on that least one boat
[01:21:07] and the helicopters but the thought that our friend and ally would do something so treacherous
[01:21:12] was unthinkable but nothing was normal anymore and that thought was the only possible explanation
[01:21:19] the brutality intensity and long duration of the attack and the obvious fact that they wanted to kill
[01:21:24] us all and sink the ship had become quite clear to all of us. Why else would they destroy our only
[01:21:32] means of escape by shooting up our lifeboats? As I began to resume my regular duty sounding
[01:21:40] security and damage control I realized that my heroic shipmates had saved the ship that day
[01:21:45] by remaining at their posts wall under the attack. I started making my usual rounds which now
[01:21:51] included both bulkheads encompassing the CT spaces where the torpedo had hit. The walls made from
[01:21:58] plate steel no more than an inch thick if that were sweaty from the cool ocean water on the other
[01:22:04] side. I could even hear the water sloshing around knowing that if the bulkheads ever gave way we would
[01:22:10] all be gongers. There were cracks in the steel walls caused by the enormous pressure being
[01:22:17] exerted against them by the Mediterranean Sea. They were ballooning outward from that pressure
[01:22:24] and I feared that the cracks would get larger and larger until they finally would give way.
[01:22:28] They looked like they were alive and breathing as they heaved in and out with the movement of
[01:22:34] the ship and the pressure of the water. I got shivers standing in such close proximity to them knowing
[01:22:40] that the only thing standing between me and my own death was a plate of steel that was ready to
[01:22:45] come crashing into the boiler room at any second. That thin steel wall was the only thing keeping
[01:22:52] the sea water from flooding into the interior of the ship and if that happened the ship would have
[01:22:56] immediately sunk from a huge explosion when the cold water hit the hot boilers.
[01:23:07] So you're looking at the wall of the ship. You know on the other side of this wall and these
[01:23:13] are like interior walls that aren't meant for the pressure of the external sea. You can see them
[01:23:19] bowing from the pressure. They're like balloons just bowed out, cracks in the bottom on the sides
[01:23:28] and water was coming through not a lot. I mean just sweating more less sweating.
[01:23:35] But we got help finally from the U.S. as Davis and Massey and the Davis Food coming aboard
[01:23:42] and gave us greatest assistance and great help in securing the ballcats with
[01:23:48] wood and plywood. It was a new wall. Press up against the bulkhead and you had to check it out
[01:24:00] every half hour 45 minutes. If I went on watch my other shipmates would go through there
[01:24:07] and get under there. Like I did with a battle liner and look, I thought to myself,
[01:24:14] why this is pretty stupid. What am I going to do? If it fuzz over now and I'm here looking
[01:24:20] from the cracks, it makes sense to me but I had to do it. And your boilers are still running this
[01:24:25] whole time. Yes sir, boilers were never taken off line one was taken off line but we always had
[01:24:30] steamed as well as always at least one boiler. What direction were you sailing in? Do you even know
[01:24:36] where were you trying to go? The worst I think. Pardon me. I mean were you trying to get to the
[01:24:39] fleet? Were you trying to do? Yeah I think once the attack started, I think we took a northernly course
[01:24:46] trying to get out of there might have even been a north-westernly course trying to get away from
[01:24:54] this just get away from that whole area. Exactly. But obviously we couldn't move fast enough to
[01:25:02] get away from you know, screaming jets and older torpedo boats. I mean flight speed for us was
[01:25:10] what? 17 knots? I think we did 21 knots during the speed to speed drowder. Yeah, yeah, from
[01:25:17] Abbie and Dorota. Oh okay. So it was the USS Davis and the USS Massey that eventually showed up.
[01:25:25] Were you there on this looking form when they showed up? Oh yeah I saw him come out of the
[01:25:29] morning mist. 16 hours later. How that feel? Pist? Where were you? And what was the look on the faces?
[01:25:44] The guys when they would they put just prolonged side to you guys? Yeah. One of them, well,
[01:25:49] initially they sent boats but I think the Davis actually tied up alongside us for a while.
[01:25:54] And what were those sailors? They were in damage control and they had more equipment than we did.
[01:26:05] And to be quite honestly, they had more expertise and they were in shock but they
[01:26:15] they knew what they were doing and God bless them for that. They helped us out a lot but they
[01:26:20] lived with these guys for so good dust and it wasn't a Navy's fault. It was the higher apps
[01:26:28] like I said before because these guys, I mean they felt bad. They could have been, they could have helped us.
[01:26:34] The captain asked for escort, a DE or a destroyer, anything but you're not a warship,
[01:26:43] you're not a X-Lerieship. Nobody's going to mess with you and so they did not even that just
[01:26:49] having escort. It going into a war zone with an unarmed ship. I mean it's pretty incredible.
[01:26:57] That's why I know that in my heart and I think my ship may probably agree to that
[01:27:05] we were set up to have this exact thing happen. The only thing is they couldn't sink us.
[01:27:11] They sure tried but they couldn't do it. And that by the grace of God, we're here right now
[01:27:16] to be on your great show and to have your listeners take a look at this because we're not a
[01:27:22] cabal, we're not conspiracy, we're not anything. We're just American citizens that served our
[01:27:27] country honorably to tell the truth and we'll go down that way to the last man's standing.
[01:27:35] We're not going to take this. We haven't taken it for so many years. Joe was the first president
[01:27:40] of the LVA. He was in Saudi Arabia. He worked for Ramco and he was a president long distance.
[01:27:49] Remember that Joe? Yeah. And it was pretty amazing but I just give all the credit to the great
[01:27:58] crews. He's wonderful man here and I love them all and I'm proud to be in American.
[01:28:03] But I got to say one thing at this point in my life, Jockel, I'm not, I've always been proud of my
[01:28:11] country. Now I'm not right now because I'm ashamed of what's going on, the leadership and
[01:28:17] it reminds me of back in 67, the same type of leadership. Cancer culture just didn't start with
[01:28:25] these people. It started a long time ago in 67. They tried to cancel us out but they couldn't do it.
[01:28:31] I've had threats to my life. A lot of things have been made of my life for a sandy ego visiting
[01:28:41] and I was in the lounge. I have a drink from my wife. Get ready to go get something to eat.
[01:28:47] In this guy I set beside me and he says, oh, you're aboard the liberty and I said,
[01:28:54] how do you know that? And he began to tell me the whole story and the best thing for me to do is
[01:29:00] he shut up. I said, what? He says, listen, I work for the massage, I'm a massage agent and you
[01:29:08] better shut up my wife was there too and bored to she give him hell. They had to get security
[01:29:15] to get us up to our room. But I asked the bartender, I said, who is it guy? Well he's been coming
[01:29:21] here last couple of days and he said he was a doctor. He said he told me to, and it'd be great
[01:29:27] being watch on. I told him, get the watch out of my face. You're taking pictures from me or whatever you're
[01:29:31] doing and he's just probably but I gave you another warning and that's what my wife jumped in and
[01:29:38] I think she gave me more heck than I did because she said she's a fighter too but it was
[01:29:45] it was amazing and how did they find out who we were in San Diego either by my credit cards
[01:29:54] or phone or something. I don't know but they found us and gave me a stern warning and that was
[01:30:01] 13 years ago when that happened. One thing should be said about the six-fleet personnel,
[01:30:10] their radioman didn't come out of this unscathed because they listened to our calls for help after
[01:30:18] the aircraft recalled knowing that those aircraft were recalled and it had to affect them because
[01:30:26] we were still calling for help. I mean just in case anyone has anyone doesn't have the impression of
[01:30:40] what happened on this ship. Let me go back to the account here as this sort of wraps up one
[01:30:46] of your final duties. Phil you say Rick a Mediani found some undamaged firehots as began
[01:30:51] hoising off the deck with a suicide nozzle that sprayed water and very concentrated high pressure
[01:30:57] stream. It took both of us to handle this hose because it was like a giant python and one man could
[01:31:03] not do it alone. It was the most gruesome heartbreaking task either of us had ever done because
[01:31:11] every piece of flesh was the remains of our fellow sailors many of whom were friends. As a Mediani
[01:31:19] went about this ungodly task, tears streamed down our faces and I prayed to God for forgiveness
[01:31:26] for how we were forced to treat the remains of these men. In the guntubs we found a shoe with a
[01:31:33] foot still in it which we put aside for collection. Many of the blood stains would not come off even
[01:31:41] with that special hose because the previous day's intense heat not just baking under the sun's
[01:31:47] heat but from the rockets and napalm that had been dropped on the ship by the attacking aircraft.
[01:31:53] We found out the hard way how hot this brutal weapon can burn as hot as 2,200 degrees Fahrenheit.
[01:32:23] So, the Davis, they also start taking some of your wounded off. Is that correct?
[01:32:36] I'm not very clear on that, you're not going to go for sure but I do know that the most seriously
[01:32:42] wounded were airlessed off the ship from the US and America and the Davis and the Massey were
[01:32:54] I guess more or less there to help us out. But I don't take any of the evacuees at what
[01:33:03] it was. So they did start pulling the wounded guys off. And then you guys end up
[01:33:18] sailing to Malta. That's the next thing that you do. You get to the ship stays underway and again
[01:33:26] you got some good stuff in your account. Just that trip is no easy trip because the walls
[01:33:31] are could collapse at any moment and it's not the closest. Oh it's not the closest spot. No.
[01:33:39] Where would have been the closest spot? What would the free free free free free free? Why did they pick
[01:33:45] Malta? Hope when we'd sink? If it's further away doing a four four nost five nostops, how many days
[01:33:54] it take you to get there? Six or seven days. Yeah, seven days. Yeah it was and then I was probably
[01:34:03] probably already know this but that Admiral Kidd. I think it's another reason they sent us to Malta
[01:34:09] because he wanted to brief us all and get our account of what went on. Yeah I've got your account
[01:34:15] of how that goes down. That's very interesting and actually I got another account from Ron Koukou
[01:34:21] and I said that right. Yes. Ron Koukoukou and he's one of the survivors. He's actually the guy
[01:34:25] that helped put this interview together. He did. He's got a book that's called Remember The Liberty
[01:34:32] that he wrote and he had this to say about the events once you guys arrived in Malta. He said
[01:34:37] on arrival in Malta we were headed straight to dry dock and once we were in it was up to the great
[01:34:42] crew at Malta to get us set up for repairs and whatever else needed to be done. What never occurred to
[01:34:49] me was the grizzly duties that we were that were about to be laid squarely on our shoulders. In my
[01:34:54] case as a senior enlisted man on the crew I was putting charge of recovery and identification.
[01:35:00] I would admit I tried to talk my way out of this one but I was told those from my orders and I followed
[01:35:05] them. That hour arrived sooner than I wanted as we made our way down to the dark hole below.
[01:35:11] No one knew it to expect and I was extremely apprehensive about what we could see.
[01:35:15] For 48 years I've said a little about what I saw because I wanted to spare the loved ones
[01:35:22] of these men. That cruelty if I could. With the writing of this book and in the distance in years
[01:35:30] I think I can at least say that the scene could compare to a wrecking yard of autos.
[01:35:37] But these were human body parts strewn everywhere. Carnage that escapes description with mere words.
[01:35:43] And there were more bodies that were down below which were brought to me to try and identify.
[01:35:49] Those bodies were wedged between steam pipes and in places that a body wouldn't fit.
[01:35:56] If it's any consolation to the loved ones of those men know that they never knew what it hit them.
[01:36:03] They couldn't have it had to have been instantaneous.
[01:36:15] Once you're in multi time for this investigation this investigation is being run by
[01:36:19] Admiral Isaac Kid. Actually Admiral Isaac Kid Jr. The senior Isaac Kid, Admiral Isaac Kid, was
[01:36:29] killed in Pearl Harbor. His son Jr. was commissioned 12 days after his father was killed and
[01:36:39] he served in Europe in the Pacific Theor's World War II. He was the guy in charge of this
[01:36:44] liberty incident inquiry. As you already mentioned I mean you'd think an incident like this
[01:36:50] just to gather the proper information would take months and then to go through it all would take
[01:36:56] months if not years to get through it all. They get this whole thing done in seven days.
[01:37:03] Yes sir and you know Dr. Keyford very eloquently said why would the United States government take
[01:37:13] on faith with the Israeli said when they muscled us I witnessed his never to say a word about it
[01:37:23] or consequences could be very very very severe prisoner worse we all know what worse meant.
[01:37:31] I was told that directly by Admiral Kid. That's the strange thing so Admiral Kid
[01:37:36] shows up tanks off his rank. Yes sir. And what's he a two star at this point?
[01:37:41] Yeah he was a rear was he a red arrow. So he's a two star out of
[01:37:45] Maltax office rank and since you guys down asked you all a bunch of questions hey did you see any
[01:37:50] markings on the recon aircraft did you did you see any markings on the other aircraft did you see
[01:37:55] the torpedo boat boats were there any markings on the torpedo boats did you see the the
[01:37:59] did you see the torpedo boats machine gunning the life rafts are you sure the US flag was flying
[01:38:05] over the ship so he's asking you all these questions and and at the end of asking all these questions
[01:38:13] he puts his stars back on and he says okay fellas now I'm an Admiral again and I want each and
[01:38:19] every one of you to understand something we are talking about national security here not your
[01:38:24] personal feelings not what you did or did not do I could really give a shit about any of that you
[01:38:29] listen to me once because this is the only time you're ever gonna hear it you are never
[01:38:35] to repeat what you just told me to anyone not your mother your father your wife anyone
[01:38:42] including your shipmates you are not to discuss this with anyone and especially especially not
[01:38:49] with the media or you will end up in prison or worse you know I I took that to heart when I first
[01:39:01] met Lisa be 39 years we got married ago got married in June and I never told her I was in the
[01:39:09] military at all until I read an article by Stan White he was a master chief of board the ship
[01:39:17] and it was like an ocean of relief came out for me I said wow somebody else was saying
[01:39:24] something now I can start talking little bit I know these guys here just set up the US has
[01:39:30] literally veterans association which I became a part of as soon as I found out you guys were
[01:39:35] were you know getting together and it's been a concept about ever since we were in the
[01:39:42] rose garden W. H. Bush was a president and we were out there for hours and scorching heat you
[01:39:50] know it is in DC what were you doing there were you invited to be there as as vets of the
[01:39:56] liberty to me the president you guys stationed he stiffness he wouldn't talk to us so he sent out
[01:40:03] rescue property and what year was it that that article came out that you said what year did you
[01:40:13] guys start talking about what had actually happened when you managed to book him out salt on the
[01:40:19] liberty and what year was that so in the night yeah so you guys just kept it to yourself for
[01:40:27] whatever twelve or thirteen years not saying anything yeah who would we talk to I mean
[01:40:34] everybody was spread out all over the country we didn't know where any of the survivors were
[01:40:39] did you make any sense of it in your own minds did you think yourself well I could see why they're
[01:40:44] trying to do this they don't want to have you know bad relations with this real they're trying to
[01:40:48] cover up the the fact that the American government was somehow involved with this I mean what
[01:40:53] were you thinking in your own minds I was thinking that they'd already held an investigation and
[01:40:58] and everything was copacetic but to come to find out they have never investigated it matter
[01:41:04] fact that court of inquiry was ordered by lbjada have a finding the fact they're very first one
[01:41:09] that the attack was a case of mistaken identity that's where lbj said yes that's what the word
[01:41:15] Boston said okay he was ordered he was a legal advisor yeah I got a quote here from a word
[01:41:21] Boston who's the chief legal counsel for the US Navy Court of Inquiry and he says quote I know from
[01:41:27] personal conversations I had with Admiral Kid president of the court of inquiry that president
[01:41:33] Lyndon Johnson and secretary of defense Robert McNamara ordered him to conclude that the attack
[01:41:39] was a case of mistaken identity despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary end quote
[01:41:46] and that's the chief legal counsel to the Navy Court of Inquiry to the Liberty incident this isn't
[01:41:55] somebody that's jumping in from some other you know some other realm to try and give his opinion
[01:42:02] well you know word Boston was a good man a very brave man for coming out
[01:42:10] and and setting the record straight but there were there were people before him trying to help us
[01:42:19] you know all around but when AJ Crystal wrote a book called the Liberty incident that said he
[01:42:25] won fire because it was a book of lies and he couldn't take it anymore he said I'm gonna stick
[01:42:31] up to these guys and tell the truth what did the book what did the book the Liberty incident say
[01:42:35] it said that it was a it's a it's a really talking point in an American talking point it was a mistaken
[01:42:41] identity we're not the part of a bunch of just hardened fools that have got to act to grind
[01:42:48] hardly act to grind is to tell the truth that's why we're here we're not here to to lie or
[01:42:53] fabricate or anything like that we live through it and we don't want anybody else to go through that
[01:42:58] ever again it has a government of vandal you know same tending off a canister
[01:43:03] and they left everybody there and it almost the 13 people got 13 American heroes it got
[01:43:10] slaughtered for what forgotten and that was what we were forgotten it's done it's too late
[01:43:18] Larry when did you start here in that people were starting to tell the truth about the situation
[01:43:24] again it was a Jim and a spoke assault on the Liberty I read the book but I was still on active duty
[01:43:32] and I still had my top secret clearance and so I wasn't saying anything to anybody and
[01:43:41] as it turns out after I retired from the Navy in 1986 I I went to work as a defense contractor
[01:43:51] still supporting the national security agency so I still needed my clearances so I never said anything
[01:43:58] I never really started talking about the Liberty to my family or anyone else until I
[01:44:07] started going through PTSD psychiatric you know treatments so I knew that there were other books
[01:44:18] out I know that Phil had two or three books at Hevero the one that you referenced earlier about
[01:44:25] Ron and Cookele Phil's also a contributor to that book and Ernest Gallo is another member of the crew that
[01:44:37] helped you know with that how long were you in the Navy for 21 years you get a purple heart for being wounded on
[01:44:45] I did and what would you tell people when some other you know you're out you're you're just whites for whatever
[01:44:50] reason and you know 1975 there's guys were in Vietnam sure some you know guys there's some
[01:44:58] it's corpsmen some medics some pilots some aviators might have got purple hearts some some
[01:45:02] guys from the sea wolves or something but there's not a lot of navy guys running around in 1975
[01:45:07] 1980 1985 that had purple hearts what did you say to somebody when they said hey where did you get that
[01:45:12] purple heart from I was on the U.S. a celebrity in 1967 when we were attacked and you know I got it
[01:45:20] for Shrept and wounds and that was about it you know and no one would ever pry and say you know what
[01:45:27] the hell happened to what was going on how how that occur oh I I think a couple of times you know
[01:45:34] people would try and and pry more out of me and I just wouldn't say anything I said I just can't talk
[01:45:42] about it and again it was because of the threat of fines and imprisonment if we ever spoke about it
[01:45:53] being being a communications technician all of my work that I did was secret so trying to keep a secret
[01:46:01] wasn't wasn't something that was new to me I just suppressed it to the point that um it was building
[01:46:10] up inside me and finally I had to go to counseling and did you still have your clearance?
[01:46:18] no when I when I retired in 2008 I relinquished my my clearance they didn't take it away
[01:46:26] that you didn't relict it I just decided I was 62 years old it's it's time to pull the plug
[01:46:34] uh as you were serving in the navy now it's 1975 now it's 1979 now it's 1982 and you know that
[01:46:46] you know you know you got ordered to not say anything which look I mean there's things that I've
[01:46:50] done which I'm not allowed to talk about right you realize okay I might not know everything about the
[01:46:55] situation but I know I'm not allowed to talk about it but I'm sure that there's a reason for that
[01:47:00] that makes sense and I get it you know was part of you thinking you know this is not this this
[01:47:09] this didn't happen the way they say it happened this seems like they're covered it up not for any
[01:47:14] reasons of national security but for other reasons yes I mean I because I work for the national
[01:47:21] security agency they actually did a report in 1980 that was classified top secret um and it was
[01:47:31] their recap of what happened to the US's liberty I had a copy of that report on my desk until I
[01:47:41] retired from the navy in in 1986 um and then I had to turn it back in because it was you know
[01:47:48] what that report accurate no no and I mean there was information that I knew should have been in there
[01:47:58] that had to deal with communications that that didn't reflect those communications and
[01:48:06] the thing that they were trying to report more than anything else was a lack of communications
[01:48:13] that occurred resulting from this hundred mile um free zone I guess that Israel had declared
[01:48:23] no no ship should enter into that hundred miles zone off the coast of Sinai and apparently
[01:48:34] our naval atoshae and um and Israel had told them that we don't have any navy ships there
[01:48:43] six fleet confirmed that they didn't have any any naval ships there and that's you know a problem
[01:48:51] with us traveling by ourselves that they they they didn't recognize that we were over there or
[01:48:58] they conveniently forgot that we were there but there was communications that were supposed to have
[01:49:06] been sent us telling us to move back off the coast and we never received those communications
[01:49:12] and so that's more about what this report from NSA said and it didn't talk about the other
[01:49:20] intercepts that had you know the aircraft talking to ground control we're talking about the
[01:49:26] target talking about seeing the American flag and you know I don't know why that didn't
[01:49:34] come out until later but we kept doing a freedom movement information act requests trying to get
[01:49:41] a lot of this documentation back out in the public so the truth could be told
[01:49:48] so Joe what did you do after the incident so place how much longer were you in the navy
[01:49:53] for did you stay and what did you do I got out I was transferred off the liberty onto the USS
[01:49:59] Solvenia so it was AFS 2 fast combat stewardship and the home ported in in Naples Italy
[01:50:08] and it was a very active signal bridge one of the most active in the six fleet at the time
[01:50:15] and so I go from a singleman school to a ship that doesn't need a signalman to a ship that
[01:50:25] has a very very intense signalman but after that I went I got out
[01:50:33] Halloween on 69 and same question to you I mean were you thinking to yourself what's one of the
[01:50:40] reasons you got out because you're thinking hey this crazy thing just happened to me I lost
[01:50:45] so many of my friends and now I'm told I can never talk about it again did that impact the way you
[01:50:51] thought about your career interesting thing about that um on this Elvenia there was a uh
[01:50:59] career counselor and every time you were getting short you would call you in this office and give you
[01:51:05] a long-speel about why you should trip over and stay in the navy so he didn't know he didn't know me
[01:51:10] personally and they didn't know my history so he called me into his office sat down and he said as
[01:51:18] well-metters you're getting short you're thinking about shipping over and I said no and he said why
[01:51:25] it's because I was on the liberty and he said goodbye yeah Roger that Phil what was the rest of your
[01:51:33] career like well I joined February the 6th and got out December the year yeah 64 now get out
[01:51:42] December the 12th 1967 I stayed out for a couple of years and I wasn't going to ship both
[01:51:49] Reather because I was done but then uh you know here I'm I'm 22 then or 23 and I say man I'm not
[01:51:58] my life's not going anywhere I'm not doing anything sorry I read a lesson what back then navy and it
[01:52:03] got stationed for the US as Maddox he just uh 731 that was in the talking dog talk that's how
[01:52:11] the Vietnam War started and some of the original crewmates were still on there it said hey turning
[01:52:17] that that never happened that's all BS it was a pretext for war they Johnson dreamed up and it
[01:52:23] turned right back around to the US has a liberty another pretext phony outcome to keep his war machine
[01:52:36] going to Vietnam and it's a land grab for Israel and a permanent foothold in the area for the United
[01:52:46] States so you when you got to the Maddox and they're talking about those attacks those you know
[01:52:54] supposed attacks and the guys would say I didn't happen yeah no I didn't happen in the way it
[01:53:00] worked and I told a couple of guys about their you know my situation my
[01:53:09] division officer he read my file and this is when I was getting out and he says hey man
[01:53:14] maybe you should get out I wasn't I wasn't really into it but I thought well maybe I
[01:53:25] can tough it out you know made a few bucks while I was in the service but that's how I was
[01:53:32] feeding my family with your lucky to be transferred to the star can then the call
[01:53:36] the um as this call as this cover up continues I got another statement here this is from
[01:53:49] this is from Lieutenant General Marshall S. Carger director of the NSA
[01:53:55] under who's authority the liberty was operating he said couldn't be anything else but deliberate
[01:54:01] there's just no way you could have a series of circumstances that would justify this being an accident
[01:54:08] you know as my friend Darrell Cooper pointed out when this attack happens once an international
[01:54:14] lodge an even convention when a when a naval vessel gets disabled you're then as the attacker
[01:54:22] responsible for trying to help lend aid to that ship and certainly the sailors that are that are
[01:54:28] in the water if they're in the water you're not supposed to be gunning up their lifeboats and
[01:54:34] strafing their their the decks of their ship as they're already disabled vessel so this is just
[01:54:40] wrong and every circumstance and you know I was talking before we started recording this you know I've
[01:54:44] been in friendly fire incidents before um in pretty bad ones where people died and I totally understand
[01:54:55] that there's the fog of war that these things happen that that that you make mistakes and someone
[01:55:00] sees something that they didn't think they saw or someone saw something that they didn't think they see
[01:55:04] and there's all things that there's a lot of chaos that happens but to have that happen for
[01:55:11] hours upon hours when there's an American flag flying you know and and you know Joe that was
[01:55:19] again this is something else we were joking about when you're off air you know since you were
[01:55:23] a single men with no other ships to signal to you really had one job and that was to know what
[01:55:29] was flying what the ship was flying and you know 100% that that that that the American flag was
[01:55:35] clearly visible and that you actually ended up raising an even bigger American flag that's right
[01:55:43] you know I might add to that uh jacco the uh is really war room had his plotted on their map
[01:55:51] as American and friendly they said they changed the watch and inadvertently forgot we were there
[01:55:59] and took us off their war table I mean come on man you know when you when you change watches
[01:56:06] you you inform everybody of what's going on and they just took it all the way and that's uh still
[01:56:14] it or it takes me I know because he's guys too yeah and by the way there's no more important
[01:56:18] piece of information on the battlefield than where your friendly forces are yes sure so this isn't
[01:56:22] like we oh well whatever you know we're just gonna pull some people off the board no that's that's a
[01:56:27] synth and people focus on the flying of the flag was it flying was it not flying but that's really
[01:56:36] that's not that's just one of the ways of identifying a ship you know it's there's the color
[01:56:41] the structure how the the deck is laid out you know the the masks and all that stuff and they
[01:56:48] claim that they approached within the thousand yards and miss identified it says a 40 year old black
[01:56:54] hull the russed out Egyptian tramp steamer half our size jacco Tony Hart
[01:57:06] then a chief pedi officer assigned to a US Navy relay station in Morocco that handled
[01:57:11] communications between Washington and the sixth fleet remembered listening as defense
[01:57:16] secretary Robert McNamara in Washington ordered rear admiral Lawrence Geiss commander of the
[01:57:24] America's carrier battle group to bring the jet's home when Geiss protested that the liberty was
[01:57:30] under attack and needed help Hart said McNamara retorted that president Johnson is not going
[01:57:37] to go to war or embarrass an American ally over a few sailors end quote that's a violation of article 99
[01:57:50] of the UCMJ it is indeed it is indeed yes article 99 of the UCMJ you have to go out and attack
[01:58:00] the enemy and you have to go out and support your other troops that's article 99 yes
[01:58:10] statement by CIA director at the time of the attack Richard Holmes in a 1984 interview
[01:58:16] he said everything possible is done to keep from the American public really the enormity of this
[01:58:22] attack on an American naval vessel since this is for the agency's record I don't think there can be
[01:58:28] any doubt that the Israelis knew exactly what they were doing any statement to the effect that they
[01:58:34] didn't know it was an American ship is nonsense I mean that's that's pretty freaking clear
[01:58:46] you guys got a bunch of awards for you know for what took place including the Medal of Honor
[01:58:58] Captain McConnell received the Medal of Honor for for his actions which is strange to take the story
[01:59:11] of someone receiving the Medal of Honor not explained what happened that was covered up in an
[01:59:18] naval shipyard that's where he received these Medal of Honor and shipyard not it's a White House
[01:59:22] where he can be recognized for being the skipper of our ship and getting the Medal of Honor
[01:59:29] because it brings too much heat on and unfortunately I think the captain was between a real rock
[01:59:37] in a hard place on one hand he can be treated like a hero on the other hand he can we can be treated
[01:59:45] like a Z-Roll and he went with hero I'm not saying he didn't deserve it I'm just saying that
[01:59:52] he clamped up and it was years and years later I wanted a year later he finally said well yeah
[01:59:57] I think it was a it was a plan to tag that was I think there's a copy of his retirement speech
[02:00:03] you can watch it online I've watched it and I think it was his retirement speech where he says
[02:00:08] hey we need to find out that we need to tell the truth about what actually happened
[02:00:12] yes sir he wouldn't even join the LBA I tried for years to get him to join but he says it's too
[02:00:18] political for him to get involved and finally he did join the association after years and years
[02:00:27] which were a vodice
[02:00:28] Dean Ross who is secretary the state at the time said I was never quote I was never
[02:00:36] satisfied with his Rayleigh explanation there's sustained attack to disable and sink liberty
[02:00:41] precluded and assault by an accident or some trigger happy local commander
[02:00:47] through diplomatic channels we refuse to accept their explanations I didn't believe them then
[02:00:52] and I don't believe them now the attack was outrageous you know some of the things that you already
[02:01:01] talked about there's a there's a BBC documentary called Dead in the Water it's it's it's
[02:01:07] you know one of the things that it said is what you said earlier Phil which is hey if the
[02:01:12] is Rayleigh's could get the Americans into this war in a big way you know that can really help us out
[02:01:18] against these Arabs is what is Rayleigh was thinking and these kind of things happen
[02:01:30] what is what do you guys do with the LBA now what's what's the purpose
[02:01:35] how can people help well one of the things that we're still trying to do is get recognition
[02:01:41] for our 34th fall in shipmates we've tried over the years to get Congress to
[02:01:49] conduct a fallen impartial investigation and it's fallen on deaf ears
[02:01:56] right now we've got a resolution going forward to the ask for June 8th to be
[02:02:05] declared as a US celebrity remembered stay it should be a fairly simple thing for Congress to
[02:02:16] do I mean we have national hot dog day in national you know ice cream day let's have a
[02:02:24] national US as Liberty remembered stay and not just one year but every year June 8th right
[02:02:37] so we're working on that I've got a resolution in the state of New York going through the
[02:02:42] American Legion up there to have that presented through their channels I'm in a process of doing it
[02:02:51] a state of Maryland I'm working with a former senator Pete McClusky to get a petition out
[02:03:03] to get signatures for people that will support the establishment of June 8th is US
[02:03:09] a celebrity remembered stay and then present that to various legislators to show them that
[02:03:17] hey the American public wants to know they need to know and you know if nothing else you're
[02:03:27] you're honoring the 34 men that gave the ultimate sacrifice back on June 8th 1967
[02:03:36] when when you talk about some of the awards that were received most every one of us that received
[02:03:43] any kind of an award purple heart or prom star you know the Congressional Medal of Honor
[02:03:49] it was all done in private there were no big ceremonies like you would normally expect for you know
[02:03:57] someone with that just came off the most decorated ship in the United States Navy since World War
[02:04:03] II and you know 95% of the American public is not even aware but you know Jacob he said
[02:04:16] something very interesting about the American Legion which fires me up because about four or five years
[02:04:25] ago Len Hall of the and Ernest Gallo our former president we're at the convention in the
[02:04:33] American Legion and they're wanted to get a booth and things like this and they wouldn't allow it
[02:04:40] for us to get a booth so Len Hall of the he was so disappointed and upset he tore up his American
[02:04:48] Legion card right there and he didn't throw it in anybody he just sprinkled it right there and the
[02:04:56] girl said one of the organizers he assaulted me and they threw his ass in jail
[02:05:04] well I wouldn't they let you have a booth because they said the US has liberty is non
[02:05:12] is not essential we don't recognize you guys and don't ever come back because you're banned from the
[02:05:18] American Legion for life this is from their national convention it's still in effect today
[02:05:27] that we can't have a booth when he's talking about Ernie and and Len going to that
[02:05:34] national convention they went there with the understanding that we had already paid our $1,000
[02:05:41] entry fee and they got there and we're told that they hadn't received the check and they hadn't
[02:05:48] received the check so Ernie pulled out his credit card and said I'll pay for it right now we're here
[02:05:56] we're we want a booth and they said no you can't do that and then I think it got to be somewhat
[02:06:02] confrontational and that's when you know Glenn got upset tore up his membership card and
[02:06:16] we've tried in vain since then to get senior management in the American Legion national
[02:06:23] organization to reinstate us so that we can have a booth there that's how we tell our story that's how
[02:06:31] we get other patriots to you know go back to their home states and say hey let's let's try and do
[02:06:38] something and support of the U.S. celebrity I wrote up a couple of years ago resolutions for every
[02:06:45] state in the union this was done at the VFW national convention and I had a representative
[02:06:53] from from each state take one of these resolutions back for their legislators to consider an
[02:07:00] introduced in their state legislator. and I don't know that anything ever came of it and that's
[02:07:12] the problem with a lot of this trying to get people to stand up and say hey if you want our
[02:07:20] support will support you just like your audience today if there's people out there that are willing
[02:07:26] to you know pick up the torch and run with it I'll be more than happy to write up a resolution for
[02:07:34] any organization that they have and and ask them to support the establishment of the
[02:07:41] June 8th U.S. celebrity remembered today. Do you guys have a website? Yes. And what's that?
[02:07:49] U.S. celebrity veterans.org. I think you take care of that Josh J.
[02:07:54] And I know actually it's we have a webmaster for it. Okay. That the one I take care of is U.S.
[02:07:59] celebrity veterans.org. Yeah. Yeah. To donate anybody out there wants to help the celebrity
[02:08:08] veterans continue on doing what we're doing. We're a small organization now a lot of the guys have
[02:08:13] already passed on you know the older guys we just lost the commander loose he was 92 I think. Yeah.
[02:08:21] And he just died this year and a good man a brave man he's he's also in a sacrifice and
[02:08:27] liberty I think you're really going to get a good insight of what went on Jocco because it is
[02:08:33] sacrifice and liberty to me is probably the most interesting
[02:08:40] truthful documentary that's ever been done in my view. Now I think you was probably free.
[02:08:46] Yeah I would. It's you've got I witnessed accounts being taken into account
[02:08:53] through through the four different you know one hour disk so it's it's not a quick breed you
[02:09:01] got to get a devote some time to it but it's certainly well worth going through it and
[02:09:07] hearing from probably what a half a dozen or so of us survivors and
[02:09:19] true news that are an excellent job and that just can't say enough about how they
[02:09:26] did their research not just with with us but with other authors and
[02:09:33] I guess senior politicians so that it's a most factual account that I'm aware of.
[02:09:47] Yes it's a resource of iRiser and a unique position in the American history and
[02:09:51] US Navy history where the only crew in US Navy history that has the task of lobbying
[02:09:59] the deal D and Congress to investigate at hack on our ship and we don't have any experience at that
[02:10:09] we don't know anybody who does but we need help from people who do we love to have a
[02:10:17] professional approach and and offer his services we can't bear him we don't have any money
[02:10:23] but we need professional help in lobbying and in the legal arena we don't know if
[02:10:33] I don't know if if there's any legal steps we can take we were in military we were
[02:10:38] it was our job to to go where we're supposed to go and do we're supposed to do
[02:10:43] whether we're civilians on the ship too. Do you guys feel like there's been progress
[02:10:49] towards getting the truth out there because to me I mean when I hear about the US
[02:10:56] Liberty now I immediately kind of most people know sort of the underlying story that it was
[02:11:03] an attack it was from Israel that you know the US Navy lost a bunch of sailors they don't necessarily
[02:11:10] know how many but do you guys feel like there's progress been made in the story getting out there
[02:11:15] in the truth getting out there there's progress being made but not to the extent that people who can
[02:11:22] do something about it do something about it so what is it that what would be the the win what
[02:11:28] would be victory for you all. I'm sitting in the mines winter circle right now with you doing
[02:11:35] I feel like a winner and I think these two gentlemen feel the same way and I want to mention my
[02:11:40] shipmates they all know about this and I'm sure they're going to download this and watch it
[02:11:43] but a special thanks you know to Moshefer and his wife Donna he's the money man he takes care of the
[02:11:51] money no we have and they have a ship story you can buy things from and it's just
[02:11:59] our way of trying to give them to get back the real story and in the last three or four years
[02:12:07] Jockel we've been more progress and we have in the last 55 because of sacrificing liberty and
[02:12:14] now here we are with you and possibly Jill Rogan is going to get a call from you and say hey you've been
[02:12:21] a get these boys on. I could try and I think that's a long list of people try to go on
[02:12:29] I'm Mr. Rogan's podcast I can guarantee you that. Well the win for me is a congressional
[02:12:36] investigation okay complete and comprehensive redundant to be sure but it needs to be said
[02:12:43] congressional investigation but that's a two-edged sword because members of Congress have refused to
[02:12:51] investigate the attack on our ship. War crimes is the US statute. Accessory after the fact is the US
[02:13:01] statute. So members of Congress who were in a position to conduct an investigation refused to
[02:13:09] despite being lobbied by victims of those war crimes might stand accused of being
[02:13:16] accessories after the fact and I don't think accessories after the fact is covered under
[02:13:21] congressional immunity. So there's some scared yeah Congress people out there there's no statute
[02:13:28] limitations on murder and none and that's what happened. The murder these men and try to murder us.
[02:13:34] I mean you know I call the FBI's CIA and I tell him hey I'm like I witnessed a murder and they get
[02:13:41] all excited. Did I tell him what is all about? There's a little bit of that's not it's never
[02:13:46] mind that's what you've been investigating. We've never had an investigation except the
[02:13:51] the phony board of inquiry and we get letters back from Congress somewhere in the earth that I brought
[02:13:56] to show you there's been multiple investigations so there's never been none to align to us where I
[02:14:03] witness is to what happened and they're telling us that we've been it's been a congressional investigation
[02:14:10] at least three or four times or it's never been a congressional investigation. They lied to us
[02:14:14] but do you think they're telling American people? Probably a good place to wrap it up I mean that
[02:14:24] that sounds like we know what we want to do to move this thing forward with the Congressional
[02:14:27] investigation get the word out there. Let's make due-nate you know National Day of Remembrance
[02:14:33] for the USS Liberty Larry just any closing thoughts from you? No I just encourage your listeners to
[02:14:45] you know take what we've said today and if they have any interest at all and trying to support
[02:14:52] the Liberty go to our website contact us you know our contact information is on the website
[02:15:02] and like I said I'm willing to draft resolutions or petitions whatever they want
[02:15:12] for their organization to get signatures to take before their legislators and trying to get support
[02:15:20] for this recognition for our fallen ship rates that should have happened 55 years ago.
[02:15:31] Indeed on our blog there's a USS Liberty veterans dot blog there's a tab that says I
[02:15:38] think it's help us out and in that tab or a series I think four letters you can write to
[02:15:44] you can just fill in the blank and submit one is calling for have a member of Congress send you
[02:15:51] a copy of the Congressional investigations and they can't do it one is asking them to contact
[02:15:57] the Congressional Research Service and ask them to ask the US government and investigate
[02:16:03] the attack and we got a response from one I've been trying for years and one finally actually asked
[02:16:09] the the Congressional Research Service and he said no another one asks for Congress to allow
[02:16:17] their boilerplate responses to members to constituents who write asking about the attack
[02:16:24] stop using Israeli talking points use USS Liberty survivors talking points and
[02:16:32] the the the season way to for them to get involved and then when they get the responses
[02:16:41] send them to us and we can draft a a response for them to to send.
[02:16:46] That's the old letter writing campaign. Yeah let's get let's get them that way
[02:16:52] anything else shall I think that's it. Fill any closing thoughts. Yes and closing I
[02:16:58] encourage your listeners and watchers at all down low-diss share it with everybody
[02:17:04] pass the word around. Write your senators and congressmen and let her know that the real deal
[02:17:10] is that you've been lying about this all the time and we know it but they don't want to come back
[02:17:15] and tell them tell everybody that their lives anyway I mean it's going to be hard I mean
[02:17:20] the Congress and everything is going to take the people people your listeners to help us out
[02:17:24] people that did watch sacrifice on Liberty go sacrifice on Liberty.com and God bless you for having us on
[02:17:32] your your good man and all of you I appreciate it so much God bless you. One thing I
[02:17:37] forgot to mention since your blog is posted on your YouTube site there's a comment section
[02:17:45] and we'd be happy to enter into a dialogue with anybody on that comment section whether they're
[02:17:51] pro is really think they're pro is really or on the US side. The comments will definitely be there.
[02:17:59] Okay yeah we look forward to it. Well thanks for coming you know that these these
[02:18:06] the conjecture and the mystery around all these events they they they've been around for a while but
[02:18:11] I think there's one thing that there's absolutely no mystery about one thing that cannot be disputed
[02:18:16] and that's the courage and the valor and the sacrifice of the brave sailors of the US S Liberty.
[02:18:22] So thank you for coming on thank you for sharing your story. Thank you all personally for your
[02:18:31] service and your sacrifice and we won't forget what you did for the country and nor will we ever
[02:18:37] forget the memory of your 34 shipmates who gave their lives and who embodied the navy ethos
[02:18:48] of honor, courage and commitment we commit to not forgetting their sacrifice. Thank you.
[02:18:54] Thank you yes thank you. Thanks for coming guys. Thanks you.
[02:18:58] And with that Joe and Larry and Phil have left the building echo did you know anything about the
[02:19:05] USS Liberty prior to today. Oh I have heard things. I'm not at the end of the day no. Let's say
[02:19:13] there's level five knowledge. I was at level 0.5. So you knew it existed but you didn't know too much about it.
[02:19:21] Yeah like when you said that they were coming on and you said the USS Liberty I was like
[02:19:28] like I was like okay it wasn't like just in the dark it wasn't a shot in the dark for me. No.
[02:19:33] Yeah so it's too bad more people don't know about it and I'm glad that they were able to come on
[02:19:39] and share the story and it just you know just really it is kind of crazy and I think we've done
[02:19:46] I've done some you know obviously we've done some podcasts about well about McNamara for sure
[02:19:53] and I'm not a I don't like McNamara I don't like the way he led I don't like the way he did things
[02:20:00] and so this is just like another nail in the coffin for McNamara from my perspective
[02:20:08] to know that you know he was one of the people that allowed this stuff to happen and LBJ the same thing
[02:20:16] President Johnson same thing you know President Johnson
[02:20:22] it just shows you the level of kind of corruption and ineptitude that the leadership had
[02:20:28] and what's I don't really what really bothers me about it is you know if someone's not capable
[02:20:36] and they end up in a position you're like you know if you're if you're supposed to be doing something
[02:20:41] and you don't have the capability of doing it I'm probably not I'm not going to be mad at you you know I'm not
[02:20:47] going to get mad at you but if you're capable what you're doing things a certain way for
[02:20:53] because you think you're smarter than everybody else or you think you can outsmart the
[02:20:56] American people or you think you can outsmart you know your your boss or whatever and you you
[02:21:02] you're trying to maneuver I'm going to have a problem with that so I'm going to have a more of a problem
[02:21:06] with I'm actually going to have a lot more of a problem with someone that's just hey echo had this
[02:21:11] idea this what he thought was going to happen it didn't go that way okay you know got it
[02:21:18] he's not capable of doing it he didn't understand the situation like he can't get mad at someone's
[02:21:24] lack of ability to do something but if echo was smart and you were in there and you made decisions
[02:21:30] that actually made things go a certain way that's going to make me mad and that's how I feel
[02:21:36] about Mac and Marin Johnson and so there you go so what okay so governments claiming mistake
[02:21:45] and identity they're claiming what like what exactly what's the explanation there are several
[02:21:53] explanations the main thing that what the what the government says the fashion say it's all the
[02:22:00] government's not all the government says this that this cover up at the time was hey it was mistaken
[02:22:03] identity it was a you know unfortunate incident the the Israeli said sorry we're carrying on with our
[02:22:10] mission there's two there's two real explanations one of them is that hey the Israelis didn't want
[02:22:20] Americans listening so they attacked the ship and there's one that is the Israelis wanted
[02:22:28] they wanted America to enter the war and they knew that America would enter the war if one of
[02:22:36] the American ships was attacked by these Arab forces and so they tried to do it in such a way
[02:22:44] that because you wouldn't think the Israelis would do that I mean that's like crazy right there's
[02:22:48] are are actual allies so how could this happen it must have been the you know it was obviously
[02:22:53] the Arabs there's no survivors the ship is sunk and gone we better go pay the Arab nations back
[02:23:02] for sinking our ship so is it out of the question that people do that kind of thing not at all not
[02:23:10] at all false flag attacks like that's a literal false flag attack so and look I don't really even know
[02:23:19] how debatable it even is you know like this is the Israelis have admitted that they attack the
[02:23:26] ship they've said it hey it was a mistake we're sorry it wasn't that long it wasn't that bad we didn't
[02:23:34] shoot up there's there's some where they directly conflict with no we didn't shoot up the life bolts
[02:23:40] the life bolts they said didn't do that so they they kind of claim it they kind of downplay it
[02:23:46] and claimed it's a mistake that's sort of the cover up the cover up is downplay it it was a mistake
[02:23:51] the reality is at least at least admit the full extent of what happened and then on top of that
[02:23:59] was it intentional did you actually want to do this to drag Americans into this war and then
[02:24:07] if you want to do that and the people that called off the support to the vessel are Americans
[02:24:14] you knew about it so that's why these guys are calling for a full congressional investigation
[02:24:22] a congressional inquiry to figure out exactly what happened so people can be held accountable
[02:24:28] and not only so people can be held accountable but so you can look back and say hey here's the
[02:24:33] mistakes that we made we put too much power in this position we we allowed our allies to do too much
[02:24:39] we didn't run through the chain of command like there's a bunch of things that you can learn from it
[02:24:44] and to not break it down with the inquiry like that and find out what actually happened I mean
[02:24:48] a seven day inquiry I mean Phil brought in a stack of papers he got all kinds of information about this
[02:24:55] you couldn't even cover that information in seven day inquiry so yeah that's it you kind of
[02:25:03] in a way draw the line in the sand when you start like lying and then telling people would
[02:25:08] be like hey you're not allowed to talk about this whatever that's okay and even that I you know
[02:25:13] as I said on the podcast there are some things for national security where this is what happened
[02:25:20] and you can't talk about it anymore hey all the saw guys warn allowed to talk about the secret
[02:25:24] war for twenty years that's what actually happened they signed a paper and said they couldn't talk about it
[02:25:30] those are classified information you know I'll talk about it what's what makes it disturbing in
[02:25:35] this one is it doesn't seem like the national security in a straightforward manner was in jeopardy
[02:25:41] what was in jeopardy was the relationship with Israel the political standing of because if let's
[02:25:47] face it if the America would have found out that somehow our own government was involved in
[02:25:53] attacking one of our own ships like that's game over for the entire administration yeah so what are
[02:25:58] they gonna do hey don't say anything to anybody to protect their own ass and this is not beyond
[02:26:06] a guy like Johnson and not beyond a guy like McNamara yeah so these politicians that think they're
[02:26:16] smart horrible stuff so if you want to support them you can go to USS Liberty Vets
[02:26:27] Liberty Veterans USS Liberty Veterans dot org or USS Liberty Veterans dot blog that's where you can go to
