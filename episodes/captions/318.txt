[00:00:00] This is Jockel Podcast number 318 with echo Charles and me, Jockel Winning. Good evening,
[00:00:06] I come good evening. The Native Americans believed that if you gave someone a diagnosis,
[00:00:18] it was a curse. It was a curse that can become an identity.
[00:00:25] If you accept it, but a rewiring can happen. When you realize that you are the one creating
[00:00:37] your own experience, this is a long and truthful conversation with yourself.
[00:00:45] How can we learn and evolve from our successes and our failures? Where do we need to change?
[00:01:01] How can a person find solace and sovereignty in the face of experience that has been
[00:01:08] shaped by such pressure, immense hardship, bad choices, chemical manipulation, digital stimulation,
[00:01:16] and sophisticated programming that teaches you to kill.
[00:01:25] When the antiquated ways fail and repeat the same answers and produce the same results,
[00:01:32] it's time to change. You are not the victim of this life, but rather the victim of your
[00:01:44] own choices. Truth is found within oneself, but to get to that truth, you have to peel back
[00:01:53] the layers to who you are. It's self-work and self-knowing that creates profound change.
[00:02:06] Today we have an addiction problem. We are addicted to other people's ideas. We become the victim
[00:02:13] of our experience. We take magic pills or become convinced by false profits as to what will
[00:02:20] fix us or make us happy. We just want to relieve hurt and make it go away,
[00:02:30] but running from pain only magnifies the pain. We are born to honor what is good while striving
[00:02:40] for our highest self. You have to be open to everything and close to nothing. The heat, the cold,
[00:02:50] your weaknesses, failures and successes, your loss and your regrets face them. Face yourself.
[00:03:01] This is the most important and difficult battle you have ever been in.
[00:03:12] Alexander the Great once said, bury me with my hands out of the ground so the world can see
[00:03:19] that I left it with nothing. That is the plan. You change your own life from within, always from
[00:03:33] within, never outside. It's 100% in you. Life is not here to punish us, but it's here to help us grow
[00:03:46] in wisdom and knowledge and to ensure we never again are a victim of life. The time is now.
[00:04:04] That is a compilation of words that I put together that were written by or spoken by or implied
[00:04:13] by a man by the name of Micah Think. I think you are going to see that through his path in life,
[00:04:25] in boyhood, in business and war and combat and service and sacrifice, it's allowed him to learn
[00:04:31] some valuable lessons and his goal is to teach those lessons. If not the lessons themselves,
[00:04:41] then at least teach other people how to learn those lessons, how to rewire themselves to be
[00:04:48] who you want to be, to be who you can be. We are lucky enough to have Micah with us here tonight
[00:05:00] to share some of those lessons. Micah, thanks for coming by, man. Thanks, buddy. Man,
[00:05:08] I was intense. Yeah, you've got a bunch of clips out and stuff that you've written on your website
[00:05:18] and I just pulled from some of it and watched from your videos and pulled from some of that
[00:05:23] to try and give people a feel for sort of where you're at, but in order to get to where you're at,
[00:05:29] I guess we started at the beginning. Yeah, where have you been? Yeah, where have you been? So,
[00:05:35] where did all start, man? You know, I kind of always started, I was just a small town kid from
[00:05:46] upstate New York and I laughed because if you were to tell me when I was a kid that
[00:05:52] I'd be doing the things that I'm doing today, I would have, I'd probably would have been over the
[00:05:56] head of the frying pan. I just, I feel really fortunate to, you know, to now be in a place where I can,
[00:06:04] I can take the experiences in my life that at a point did break me down and now kind of show people
[00:06:11] that those experiences of the greatest ally that they have and this journey of self-discovery
[00:06:16] that were all on and I grew up, my dad, you know, grew up tough family, you know.
[00:06:24] My dad was, you know, seven dollars and sisters and grandpa was a mob guy and so he was in federal
[00:06:32] prison for ten years and were you alive then? No, no, it was. So this is before you were born.
[00:06:38] Yeah, it's before I was born and but he had a tough life and so he grew up as an orphan on the streets.
[00:06:44] This is your dad? My dad's dad. My grandfather. Well, I was super close to. He died when I was 16
[00:06:50] and I was really close to him. He was a hard man and he grew up as an orphan and
[00:06:57] and ended up turning his life around. I guess you could say much later in his life. He came
[00:07:01] the head of the railroad union and you know. My dad always tells the story when their life
[00:07:08] kind of started straightening out and fast-forward a little bit. My dad said they used to go back.
[00:07:12] He was an engineer in the railroad and I said he used to go back and abuse my grandfather.
[00:07:17] He'd run all these card games, you know, hustling and doing this at that and my dad would come back
[00:07:22] and say, PAH, what are you doing back here? I thought you were a Christian and he's like, you can't
[00:07:27] gamble and he's like, well, with me it's a sure thing. So it's not again. He was a card counter,
[00:07:34] even cow cards, but you know, so it's like real blue collar family, railroad family and
[00:07:39] you know, my dad, my dad grew up in that kind of life. Some of grandfather's pretty severe guy
[00:07:43] and the spirit. So did your dad grow? Did your grandfather live in all someone upstate or was he
[00:07:48] down the city? So he was upstate, he was in the city and then family moved upstate New York and then
[00:07:54] mother and father died of alcoholism and then I think nine nine of the brothers and sisters
[00:07:58] were street kids. Basically they were orphans and then my graph archepic escaping and
[00:08:04] my her fact he broke his leg as an orphan was taken back to the home had to get surgery and
[00:08:09] you want to talk about having it rough. They circumcised them and he was 10. The dog, yeah, he's an orphan
[00:08:14] kid so they brought him in there. They just like, yeah, I'll give a little sniff. But yeah, so it was
[00:08:20] an interesting kind of upbringing because my dad grew up and he went to the 82nd Airborne.
[00:08:25] I always either go to prison or go to Vietnam type deal and my dad was a really, really rough guy.
[00:08:33] He's the epitome of a tough guy, like a real tough, like a violent tough guy and he wound up in
[00:08:40] prison and he wound up in the end worth and what was this before you were born? Yeah, then so this
[00:08:46] was before I was born. My mom and dad had been together since 15 or 16. My dad had to join the military.
[00:08:52] Did he go to Vietnam? Well, he was supposed to go to Vietnam but then he wound up going to prison.
[00:08:57] Which Vietnam might have been better. But yeah, he never had that balance in his life, you know.
[00:09:04] And you know, it's interesting. My mom and dad, I think 56 years or something they've been together.
[00:09:12] But yeah, my dad went to 11th worth and he got some trouble in the military, of course,
[00:09:16] and he was riding with all the bike or gates stuff like that. I mean, he doesn't, every tooth
[00:09:20] my dad's had to have been punched out. He's got hundreds of stitches across his head and
[00:09:25] you know, he kind of just he had a rough and he hit rock bottom and he got out and he ended up
[00:09:31] becoming a Christian and then so he's prison time was in the military. Yeah, he was 11th worth.
[00:09:36] Yep. Yep. So he went to 11th worth and how long was he in 11th worth for a couple years?
[00:09:43] And then after that it was whatever dishonorable discharge most likely. Yeah. And then he got out and he just
[00:09:51] took a bus back basically. So he owed a bunch of money to
[00:09:55] like the hell's angels and those kind of guys. So they like took everything when he went to prison,
[00:10:01] robbed and blind basically. And so he got out with nothing. And you know, when I was a kid,
[00:10:07] like my Christmas is first spent like in the city missions, you know, every single Christmas
[00:10:12] we were in the slums and the hoods. We had people at my house, like straight out of prison. Like
[00:10:16] my dad, he's always telling me I was a kid. He's like, you know why I come here? He said
[00:10:19] I come here because I never want to forget where I came from. And my mom said that when my dad
[00:10:24] wouldn't she met me at a van 56 panel van that said no hope without dope. He could never
[00:10:29] figure out why you have getting pulled over all that time. But like so he was a rough guy. And
[00:10:37] my fact I know because as a kid people would come up to my dad, I wouldn't believe that, you know,
[00:10:42] it was him. And he was he was a violent human being. And they're kind of person has nothing to
[00:10:49] lose. And he was tough and he was a boxer and he was a street fighter. And so yeah, so my dad gets out
[00:10:55] and he ends up becoming a walking down the street like lowest point of his life. And he sees like the
[00:11:00] windows open and a church and the lights on and he decides he's going to walk in there and he sits
[00:11:04] in the back. The ZZ top looking guy. He looked at the pictures. He's got the huge beer with the, you know,
[00:11:09] the Jaguar 87 patches on it, you know, rats and stuff. And tattoo is yet like Jesus smoking pot and
[00:11:16] his arm. Man, all kinds of crazy stuff. And he has an experience like in that church and nobody talked
[00:11:24] to him. Like nobody would even come up to him and they just looked at him like, well, this is a
[00:11:28] scary guy. And he turned his life around right there in that moment. And so I was born in
[00:11:33] 79. My sister was born in 77. And my dad had to figure out how to put his life together. So my
[00:11:40] grandfather got him hooked up on the railroad and I ended up becoming an engineer and working on the
[00:11:46] railroad through till I was in second grade and then he started a church in a really rural town of
[00:11:52] 600 people. So we're real poor when I grew up. We all live in the same bedroom. So how many brothers
[00:12:01] and sisters were one sister? Just the one sister? Just the one sister. Yeah. And this is still an
[00:12:06] upstate New York. Yeah. And then they started doing tent revivals. So when I was like, I always tell
[00:12:11] people, I'm like, listen, I, at the time I had become, and I'm not a religious guy. But I had become,
[00:12:16] I would get saved like pretty much three to four times a week. I've been, I've been saved more
[00:12:21] than any human being in North America because you would hear these guys and they would start preaching
[00:12:25] another crescendo would build. And the worms in the hell. And I'm like, I'm like, you know, I've been
[00:12:31] kind of touching my penis or something. I'm like, I should have been kidding. I would just be
[00:12:36] at my hand up. And I was like, I moved my way up to the blanket guy where I went into people
[00:12:42] would fall down. I'd rush in with the little blanket laid over them, which a lot of them are
[00:12:47] faking because I was like, man, these people kind of just fall down and like before they even
[00:12:52] get up there, sometimes they would just, they would get over the power or whatever. So I'd have
[00:12:55] these little blankets, you know, like seven or eight years old, I'd run up the blanket and I'd
[00:12:58] always like step on their finger and they'd be like, hey, all right, like, so then I was like,
[00:13:04] sorry, questioning things. I really, I really did. So I question things. They're such as they'd
[00:13:09] push you down on the ground. But that was a crazy experience. You know, we traveled all around.
[00:13:14] Was it all around the country you travel or just like skating your. Up. Okay. I'm
[00:13:17] skating your arc, you know. So it was, remember the 80s it was kind of a wild time for that kind of
[00:13:22] stuff that people would get the laughing spells and like, you know, there was all these kind of
[00:13:26] things going on. And so I ended up, uh, I didn't even home at 16. So I, and I lived in my own from
[00:13:32] that on. Where'd you move to? Kind of moved around the country. Uh, and, uh, yeah. So I ended up
[00:13:40] moving down South Florida and getting a job down there and working and what were you doing in South
[00:13:46] Florida? Uh, my grandmother lived down there. And I lived, uh, I was homeless for a little while.
[00:13:52] I was homeless for some months down there. And, uh, I got, you know, I've gotten in some trouble.
[00:13:57] I was also a very rough kid as you could imagine. I... The thing about that whole movement,
[00:14:04] looking back now retrospectively is, is the guilt and the fear and all the things that are associated
[00:14:10] with that. And we're movement. Yeah, the revival movement. And all that kind of stuff. And it
[00:14:15] wasn't ever about love, you know, and I mean to me, like, that loving yourself and not judging
[00:14:20] yourself and all those kinds of things. It wasn't associated with that at the time. And so,
[00:14:24] as soon as I got old enough, you know, around 15, I, uh, well, I started working at 10.
[00:14:29] And, um, yeah, my first job in a dairy farm and then my time on as 14 years old, I was working 35,
[00:14:36] 40 hours a week, sometimes. Um, and that was kind of my life. Where are you going to school?
[00:14:42] Yeah, let's go into school. So I get off school. Sometimes I work to 10 o'clock at night. I work
[00:14:46] all the weekends, work Sunday after noon. Um, and then I started working for our family as a
[00:14:52] lineman. First, I was like, pick up the sticks guy, you know, I'd run around and move the trucks and
[00:14:56] do all these things. And then, um, slowly, anything to get off the dairy. I don't really drink milk
[00:15:01] because of that. Um, milk is a disturbing product. Like, it is, I don't, sorry, like, new
[00:15:10] horizon organics or whatever, but it's nasty. Like, it's a nasty thing. You know, like, on
[00:15:15] my job was to clean the others and stick these little suckers on there and, you know, like,
[00:15:19] these old bags kicking in and then, shitting on you. And it's the worst thing. And then the melt goes in
[00:15:24] there. And it's the flies and the cats lick it and stuff everywhere. And then these things got to be
[00:15:29] like constantly, you know, kept the pregnant. You know, so they're like in this perpetual state of
[00:15:34] pregnancy to get them to keep lactating, you know. And the only thing I wanted to do is just get the
[00:15:38] hell away from it. So, yeah, I ended up, uh, ended up becoming a lineman. So I learned I do line
[00:15:44] work, beat start climbing telephone poles on about 13. And uh, start making like good money doing that.
[00:15:50] So, um, I didn't do that down in Florida. I did a bunch of other things. And then, uh, I
[00:15:56] asked like, like, oh, yeah, that was a really, really rough time in my life.
[00:16:02] Uh, my effect, we were just down in Florida. And I was driving through some of the areas that you
[00:16:07] still live in. I could remember being so hungry, like, going in the grocery store and just
[00:16:11] then like, just like grabbing like food and just like seeing like the big fat security guy, like
[00:16:17] just looking at me like, and I would do the whole, like kind of like Julio Jones like, you know,
[00:16:23] and you just, I'd make it out with like one tent of what I had. Like, and I remember this particular
[00:16:29] package of sausage that I had. Um, when were you hanging around with? What was that? What was
[00:16:34] going on? Uh, I ended up, uh, I've had met some guys when I was younger and, um, that were kind of
[00:16:40] passing through. They were like street guys. And at the passing through upstate New York. Yeah.
[00:16:46] They're like selling shit and, you know, kind of rough crew. And so I actually showed up at their house.
[00:16:52] Uh, in Florida. Yeah. And I was, you know, I was in some, I wasn't some pretty big trouble at the
[00:16:57] time. And, uh, I, uh, I was, I wasn't living at home at all anyway. And so I moved down there and
[00:17:04] I stayed down there until I was 20. And, and then I moved back home. I had like 30 grand on me and,
[00:17:12] and I saw all kinds of stuff and I moved back home with a, with a stripper girlfriend. I got that
[00:17:18] out of my system. So when I got the stripper, we've been in the team. So I was like, I got a boy's,
[00:17:23] I was there when I was 17. Don't do it. And yeah. So I, I moved back home. My life was kind of like
[00:17:30] an entailspin. Honestly, I, you know, had money, had things and I had a real hard chip in my shoulder.
[00:17:35] And I just, uh, you know, I had kind of become like my father, I guess in the sense where I was,
[00:17:43] I could be violent. I was pissed off. I was just angry. Once your dad found like God,
[00:17:48] was he still pissed off in angry? No, but inversely he was really hard. He was a hard man.
[00:17:56] Like hard. You know, I didn't, I never looked at God as like God has loved and he wants to like
[00:18:01] care for us in Jesus with the lamb and stuff. You're like Old Testament God. Old Testament God,
[00:18:06] like, I'm like, I'm gonna take the staff. Those are the stories I heard. You know, like the
[00:18:09] what you'd ever hear. You're like, Jesus just loves everybody. Like, if you listen to him,
[00:18:14] like worms are gonna come suck your brains out and you're gonna burn an animal in by the way. Like,
[00:18:18] I mean, I mean, it was like that. That was the, was the revival day. Is it was the fire and
[00:18:23] brimstone? And so I was afraid of it to be honest. And I didn't like the whole thing. I didn't
[00:18:30] like the hypocrisy and the whole movement and stuff. And so as soon as I got old enough, you know,
[00:18:36] I had a bunch of money. I had worked my whole life. That's what I did. I had put my head down. I worked.
[00:18:40] I worked really hard. And that's kind of all I knew. I was like excessive compulsive worker.
[00:18:46] And you know, when I left, I was on my own. I had like, I had no like balance in my life.
[00:18:51] So yeah, I moved back home. I started doing mine work again. And actually, what big turning point for
[00:18:59] me was that I, I went on a backpack and trip on myself. And I ended up kind of having this experience
[00:19:06] out there with a bear. It was like a little backpack, whatever. And I kind of just started like thinking
[00:19:10] about my whole life. And, and how I just wasn't ready to die. I wasn't ready to, that there was
[00:19:16] something else missing. And I walked out of there. And I literally, after that moment, I kind of changed
[00:19:21] my whole life. It was nothing religious. But what was, what were you out of? In the Adirondex.
[00:19:26] Yeah, kind of where I grew up going to all the time. And so yeah, so I ended up getting back on the
[00:19:32] line crew, climbing telephone poles again. And now I look back like when I was a teenager,
[00:19:37] working on these line crews, I would spend the summer is living in New York City. And I was
[00:19:40] living with a grown man that were shooting heroin and you know, living in these, they would put
[00:19:45] me up in these hotels. And I would live in these with these guys that were like vagrants, you know,
[00:19:51] they were, they were like, they would travel from a city to city on these huge contracts. And I would
[00:19:55] be down there for the weekend. Yeah, that was a, that was tough, you know, because that was a kid
[00:20:01] matter of fact. I remember there was a guy I'll never forget on my one say his name. He's probably dead.
[00:20:05] Now, but he was like six foot eight. He was the scariest guy I was from Long Island. His brother was
[00:20:11] another gigantic dude. And they were the heaviest people I've ever seen in my life. Okay, I've never
[00:20:16] seen men that hairy in my life. I'm telling that you. And then these guys were like, these guys were like,
[00:20:22] fucking Lebanese butchers. Like, and they had the deepest voices. And I get put on a splicing crew
[00:20:29] with this guy. And I remember I'm, you know, I'm 16. It's right before I laughed. I'm living in the city.
[00:20:34] I'm living with all these guys. And of course, they would never give me a bad idea in the corner.
[00:20:38] My little like sleeping bag, you know, and they'd be doing their things. And I remember this guy
[00:20:44] would never talk to me. And he would always flick his cigarettes at me. And he was just constantly smoking
[00:20:49] pot all of a sudden. You're 16 at this point. Yeah. Yeah. And so I'm down there with this guy. I'm like,
[00:20:55] he has a van, like a white, like murderer van filled with all his cable stuff. And his heads like
[00:21:00] touches the ceiling. And he'd always be like, he always called me loser or fuck me. Whatever. Like any
[00:21:05] name, it's ever my name. He would call me. They have the deepest voice he's covered in hair.
[00:21:09] And I remember we're in Long Island. And I mean, most kids are like playing basketball. And they're
[00:21:16] out there like trying to like, you know, make out with their girlfriend, like, high school prom,
[00:21:21] like, I'm there with this dude, Jim. And I remember we're in Long Island. I'm like setting the
[00:21:27] cones up or whatever. And I'm not doing it fast enough or good enough. Everything's getting paid by the units.
[00:21:33] And I remember he's like, he's in the bucket above. And he just looks at me and he starts swearing
[00:21:39] at me. And he takes like a bolt and he throws it down. He hits me in the side of the head with it.
[00:21:42] And I had an hard head and like, I mean, it rang my bell. He can do that away on him too.
[00:21:46] Yeah. So he just like whips it down. Like, boom. Like, and I like, remember like rocked back.
[00:21:51] And I like, I went around the side of the truck and I started like kind of crying. I was like,
[00:21:57] so then I like, I just snapped. And so I started like taking all the cones. I started screaming.
[00:22:03] I'm throwing them into the road and cars like laying on their horns. This isn't your kind of like,
[00:22:07] and then I run over and I grab their emergency controls and the bucket. And I'm like,
[00:22:12] and he's like flopping shit. It's coming everywhere. And he's screaming, I'm going home.
[00:22:17] And I'm like crying. I'm like, I'm like, I'm pushing all the tools on the ground. I'm throwing everything everywhere.
[00:22:23] I kicking the truck. I'm going crazy. So finally after like 30 seconds of going crazy,
[00:22:28] and the control is I can see his like, this dude's going to murder me. So he just like stands up when I stop.
[00:22:34] And he's like, you're dead. You're dead. He says to me. And I'm like, so I just grab a huge pipe off the thing.
[00:22:42] And I'm like, and I'm out the road. And I'm just bawling my eyes out and I'm like,
[00:22:45] I'm on my screaming. And he's like, he's like coming down as little bucket out. I'm the tears and people are laying on their horns.
[00:22:53] And shit's everywhere. He looked at me and he's like, he gets down like just like at a reach from me.
[00:23:00] And I'm hitting the truck. I'm like, you're dead. He like, any problem would have killed me.
[00:23:05] And then he just like looked at me. He's like,
[00:23:10] any way back up. He made a good decision. And I was like,
[00:23:13] so he's like, pick up everything. He piece of shit. He says to me, like,
[00:23:17] it's so I'm out there picking everything up and sure enough, like I got to live in the house with the guy.
[00:23:22] So I like, you know, I go back the weeks over. And of course we go back up. You know,
[00:23:26] he was like nothing happened. You know, when I would ride back up there and he would just be like smoking like joined after joining listening to the lead Zeppelin.
[00:23:33] He would like look at me and he'd get done it. You go,
[00:23:36] like flick it at me and like hit my pants and I'd brush it off and he'd like,
[00:23:41] and he'd like, he'd like keep driving. So I mean, that was kind of like,
[00:23:45] you know, I was like joke about like, when I got in the military, like,
[00:23:50] I was already kind of like a, I wasn't afraid of much at that point. Like in the sense of like,
[00:23:55] I just had had had a lot of experiences and I had grown up on my own and grown up, you know, pretty rough. And so,
[00:24:02] I'd end up starting my own mine crew and hiring some of my, to link with friends that I grow up with, you know,
[00:24:08] and, and I happen to be in Queens, New York. And at this point, I really did turn my life around.
[00:24:14] And I'm in Queens, New York when the first plane hit the World Trade Center. So September 11th,
[00:24:19] I go to the yards and Long Island. Pick up all my equipment. We used to store everything in these huge
[00:24:24] large yards just outside the city. And I'm gonna get some of this here. I got like,
[00:24:31] some coaches. And I get, uh, get all the stuff loaded up. I got the, we used to just go down there to be
[00:24:38] dude standing out the street and I was giving cash. So I've like, who needs a job? And I'm like,
[00:24:43] who's got a driver's license? I'm like, all right, 100 bucks get in and we'd hire like a ground guy.
[00:24:47] And, um, I was making big money at the time. And I bought myself like an Audi,
[00:24:52] which is not advised. Uh, wait, what? Is there something wrong with the Audi? Well,
[00:24:57] I mean, I didn't realize that when it broke, I couldn't afford to fix it like that. That was like,
[00:25:00] and they do break. Who are your friends that you're hanging out with? Who's dudes?
[00:25:05] So like, I only really kind of ever had like the same friends kind of growing up.
[00:25:09] So the same crew from Catskill and down with you? Uh, the got, yeah. So they would work with me during the
[00:25:16] week. We'd live down there. We can say, go home. So we leave Sunday night at like three o'clock in the morning,
[00:25:20] or whatever. And then we'd be there to work Monday. And then we had a place that we'd rent.
[00:25:25] And we'd live down there, work all week, and then come back up. What do you want to ban or something, too?
[00:25:29] Yeah, yeah, I played in a funk scob band. Shout out the funk shop luminous. I think everyone's probably dead.
[00:25:34] My band. But uh, and were you guys playing gigs back then?
[00:25:38] Yeah, so we were playing gigs back then. So I ended up, uh, man, I wish I had, uh,
[00:25:44] my wife has a great picture. I of me at the house with my band. I'd plant on blonde hair and like my
[00:25:48] ears pierced, and they're like stretched out and I got the dude. Oh, yeah. So this is like nice.
[00:25:54] So this is 1990. Well, I started playing drums as a kid in church as a, you know, playing that
[00:25:58] gospel music, you know. So when you weren't, cause we got all those like shots. Like it's.
[00:26:03] So it's all those kind of like old gospel chops. And, uh, and so I started playing drums when I was eight.
[00:26:09] And, um, you know, I wasn't like that. We ended up kind of moving out of being, you know,
[00:26:14] really poor and, and, um, you know, kind of got the leg. I guess you could say like, I guess we
[00:26:19] would be the considered middle class or whatever, you know. Yeah, cause you're that had a legit job,
[00:26:23] but then the railroad. Yeah, but he left the railroad. Not what we kind of went down because God was
[00:26:27] gonna pass. Oh, Jack. Yeah. So you guys were ginging, you were in a ginging band. Ginging band. Yeah,
[00:26:35] we actually, uh, the band, the funk shop looms opened up from all the beach double all stars.
[00:26:39] Um, do you play? Oh, bro. Yeah, I actually have a demo. We actually have a demo CD. We had a song,
[00:26:46] called single man. And, uh, TV dinners always the same cause I'm a single man.
[00:26:54] One night stands at Colin Mutt name cause I'm a single man. So it was, uh, yeah, we were kind of a
[00:27:00] jam band and funk scob band. And I like that kind of chops. I like gospel music. Like, you know,
[00:27:05] that's kind of what I grew up with and um, guys like Dave Weckle and Ginger Birch and, uh, you know,
[00:27:11] so I was really actually thought I was gonna become a professional drummer. That was like what I was
[00:27:16] really aspiring at the time to be. Um, and I probably would have been how did I stay in the
[00:27:23] trajectory had none 11 not happened. Um, I mean, I was getting, I just got sponsored by Evan's
[00:27:29] drum has JD Adario. Um, so I was, I was getting pretty like serious and I probably wouldn't have
[00:27:35] stayed with that band forever. I would have moved up, you know, and no, it's a very spans and
[00:27:40] so not your band before you made it bro. I know, I was looking to you. Yeah. Yeah. I would have moved
[00:27:48] up from Loomis funk. Yeah, my music guy definitely gets people. Well, Scott is like the fact that
[00:27:57] you were playing scommies. Yeah, it's like real pretty. Yeah. It's a well, it's a particular style
[00:28:04] playing to it's a lot of like odd time signatures, you know, like um, and so it's, it's, and it's
[00:28:09] phone can gospel and all that kind of stuff has a similar foundations, you know, it's all based off
[00:28:13] of kind of like jazz, you know. So that's what I did, you know, and I played a lot of like Christian
[00:28:18] music, you know, it was like Jesus rock. Um, and let me tell you something, you get the youth group
[00:28:22] girls when you're like Jesus rock star. You told me to you're playing like at the UG, you can't
[00:28:28] have some stuff, you know, you're like you're like, you're like, you're driving the beat, you know,
[00:28:33] you love a little hard, but you know, Christian youth camp attended, just went down by
[00:28:38] eight percent of for a long girl. By the way, don't go there. I'll never send my kids there. It's
[00:28:43] the worst, you know, back at the van. So so all that's kind of where you're at, your bus and your
[00:28:51] ass work and your playing music and making money enough money to buy an outie that you really can't
[00:28:57] afford to fix, but still you got the outie and then September 11th comes. Yeah, September 11th came
[00:29:03] and I had never like, you know, thought about joining the military and then like, where were you
[00:29:06] on September 11th? Cause you're in the city. So I was in Queens, New York. Yeah, I was on a telephone
[00:29:11] bowl when it happened. So I was on a railroad pole at the time. My job was to send a, so time
[00:29:17] Warner was being stood up high speed internet road runner and we had to isolate those systems
[00:29:23] what they called power supplies. And so power supplies had to be isolated. So if there's a
[00:29:27] lightning strike, it would only go like 300 feet before the next pole and not blow the whole system.
[00:29:32] So I had a job putting in these power supplies and then grounding everything to power,
[00:29:37] bell, cable, and all the way down to the ground and then I would stall these big supplies and then
[00:29:41] wire everything up. And I got paid for everything. I mean, if I put like a screw on, I could
[00:29:46] bill for it. Whatever it was. So it was, it was a good gig. I mean, make it 7800 bucks a day. After I paid
[00:29:52] my guys on all my expenses. So it was like, it was good money and I was a hustler. And so,
[00:29:57] I mean, I could just, I would work when the sun was up, like, you know, I was on my second
[00:30:03] cup of coffee and making money. So, um, yeah, the, the first plane hits the world trades
[00:30:09] center. I'm on telephone pole. I have no idea what's going on. And I get a call in the next
[00:30:14] tell from a friend of mine that tells me that I'll play and just hit the World Trade Center.
[00:30:19] And at first I really didn't believe him. And I come down off the pole and end up like meeting a lady
[00:30:26] who's had her door open, like right next to where the pole was basically. She lived right by the
[00:30:29] railroad tracks. And what a terrible place to live. Oh my god, when people live by the railroad tracks,
[00:30:35] it's like, especially on the East Coast, like when you take the train, they'll, they'll
[00:30:41] contract. Yeah, if you live by the railroad tracks, it's a bummer. That's, that's right. Let's face it
[00:30:46] out here in California. You can live by railroad tracks in Ensenitis and have an ocean view that
[00:30:51] right in the house that you paid $4.8 million for. It's not that way on the East Coast. No,
[00:30:56] it has made it. It has made it. Shingles. Yeah. They're like, the, how, you know how this house is
[00:30:59] our shingles? Yeah. It's like, yeah, these are working on the roof. Let's just keep going. And,
[00:31:05] yeah, so I was like, so I come down. I see this lady. She's in there. She's watching the news.
[00:31:08] Has been was a port authority police officer and she was kind of crying and emotional. You know,
[00:31:13] then, obviously, the other plane hits. And like, at the time, I thought like America was like under
[00:31:19] attack or we're being invaded. I don't know. I had all these like weird thoughts probably from
[00:31:23] watching like movies and red don't. Red don't. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, yeah. So, I, I go back to the
[00:31:31] yards. And I got my buddy with me. We got rid of the other dude. We gave him his hundred bucks. And
[00:31:36] and I was like, I'm going into the city and my buddy's like, to do what? I don't like it. I don't
[00:31:41] know how to like help out. And he's like, you don't know anything. I remember this conversation
[00:31:45] we were at because I did. I don't know. I was going to do a victim or something. How old are you?
[00:31:50] I was 21. Okay. Yeah. So, I'm 42 now. And so I was like, so I go in an air drop everything
[00:31:57] off take the outie. Get on the LIE 495 and I'm like hauling an ass down there. There was no traffic.
[00:32:02] It was crazy. And I'm like, Max and this car out. It's probably why I broke down. And I get to the,
[00:32:10] I think it's the Lincoln tunnel and there's like already tactical teams and guys all standing there
[00:32:16] tell you how tight security was. Like, I had like a bunch of like cable TV and electrical IDs.
[00:32:21] And like just, you know, I look like a state department guy and I rack, you know, I have like
[00:32:26] a million badges or whatever. And I tell him I'm like a demolition crew and can you, can you let
[00:32:33] me through and they're like, yeah, bring it in. And so I just drove right on through and we went
[00:32:37] down there and parked. And that's when I, you know, towers had fallen into the radio. And that's when
[00:32:43] I realized like the severity of everything that was happened. And like I could see the smoke and people
[00:32:48] were screaming and running everywhere. And I'd never seen anything like that in my life. And so
[00:32:54] I ripped the sleeve off my shirt, put it on my face and my buddy and just walked into the smoke.
[00:33:00] Basically at this point, no idea where I was going. So I would stay there for 24 hours till September
[00:33:06] 12th. And that was, uh, what are you doing? At first, like nothing. I was just like trying to like
[00:33:16] see if anybody needed help. But like I needed help myself because I was covered in a smoke and
[00:33:20] everybody was running the opposite way. So I ended up getting in there and then they were putting
[00:33:24] together these like makeshift shirt. It was total chaos. Like I don't think that people,
[00:33:28] unless you were there, like realize like there was really no organization. It wasn't like,
[00:33:33] there was half, you know, the fire department was dead. There smashed vehicles, cop cars everywhere. So
[00:33:39] we kind of started like getting together with groups to like look for people.
[00:33:42] Layed in the afternoon, I ended up seeing like a guy's leg sticking out from underneath the police car.
[00:33:48] And a bunch of us got over there and lifted it up and he was dead. And I remember like all
[00:33:54] their gravel and everything was like shoved into his face. He must have hit underneath the car.
[00:33:58] I don't know the speculate, but whatever happened, the car lifted up and smooshed him. And so
[00:34:05] people like pulled him out and they pulled like some blankets over him and fire department came in.
[00:34:11] City bank tower fell. That tower, you know, mystical tower seven. I was like right there.
[00:34:15] And, you know, for a couple of hours, I couldn't see my hand around my face. It was one of the
[00:34:20] most terrifying experiences in my life until I became an SDV guy. Did you stay put? Did you just stay there?
[00:34:25] I just stayed there with my shirt over my head, but I couldn't breathe. And then I go to the fire department,
[00:34:29] they watched my eyes out and I stayed there all night. I found like an arm and like testins,
[00:34:35] like I had I crawled inside the World Trade Center. Like I was sliding down the metal beams
[00:34:40] into the belly of the World Trade Center. And it was like the most insane noises I ever heard of my
[00:34:46] life like creaking and you know, just like smoke and steam. And it was just it was so chaotic. I had no
[00:34:52] idea what I was doing, but I wanted to help. I had this memory of like on a bicycle to tire on my
[00:34:59] heart hat with those little like disposable ever ready like red and green like with the white switch
[00:35:05] lights. That was my headland. I had them like tied on there to the rescue. And
[00:35:10] even if I found somebody, I don't really know what I would have done because I had zero skills really.
[00:35:14] And so I'm right by that iconic picture of where the exoskeleton of the World Trade Center is,
[00:35:22] where the guys are raising the flag and it's all over the posters and stuff. I'm like sitting
[00:35:26] off to the right. And so the next morning, I was there, got some food to have like a smashed up
[00:35:33] like little bagel cart that was there with my buddy. And I remember for the first time since
[00:35:38] like that dude hit me and I had that bug nut. I uh, I was like crying really hard.
[00:35:44] Like I could feel the death. I could feel the departure of life in that area. Like you could
[00:35:51] feel the immense loss. And I was in there with my buddy. I'm like we're just crying. And he's just
[00:35:58] looks at me. He's like, man, like, what are we going to do? The sun's coming up. It's the next morning.
[00:36:02] And I just like, time was like, I'm not fucking killer. I did this. And he was like, okay, like,
[00:36:10] you know, maybe you kind of patting me on the back like, yeah, okay. And so I ended up
[00:36:17] deciding 2003 that I joined the military because what happened was I lost my contract. Like six,
[00:36:21] and maybe it wasn't six months, maybe three months later. I lost my contract.
[00:36:25] So through the end of 2001, you go back to work. Go back to work.
[00:36:32] But then they're like, you know, all this economic ambiguity, all the new build, all this stuff
[00:36:36] they start cutting, I'm like, low guy in the total, you know, subcontractor. So I own like all these,
[00:36:44] like all this line equipment that I bought and you know how to truck that was, I bought that payment
[00:36:49] on at my Audi, like I had all this shit. And now I'm like, you know, basically I'm just trying
[00:36:55] to keep everything afloat. I couldn't find any work. Everyone's freaking out. I'm watching it.
[00:36:58] It includes the TV, you know, 24 hour new cycle. And so I ended up selling everything off.
[00:37:05] picked up some like side work. And then moved out to big sky Montana. And I got a job as a ski
[00:37:12] tech out there because I was just like, I was was watching this warren Miller movie. And he said,
[00:37:18] if you don't pack up everything that you have, I moved it big sky Montana. You only be one year old
[00:37:22] year when you do. And I was like, so I got a job out there in a ski shop, fix and skis. And so I worked out
[00:37:31] there, came back. Did you know anything about skiing? Yeah, I had, I mean, my idea of skiing, like,
[00:37:37] I hate them. Like, I basically just like stole the skis. Like, and I would, I had a pair of
[00:37:42] wires and they first. And that's how I learned about ski. My parents did take me on like a youth group
[00:37:47] thing one, but I spent most of the time trying to like make out with a crow. And then get saved on the
[00:37:54] next Sunday. Get forgiveness. But I know I would go up with a pair of like wires and numbers.
[00:38:01] And you know, you just have the old things. And I would like snip them off and put them on my jacket.
[00:38:05] And that's how it would ski. And that's what's ski all the time like that. I know it sounds terrible.
[00:38:10] And I'm sorry if you're listening. And I did that too. It's free forgiveness. But I mean, that's
[00:38:16] how I was. You know, I mean, I didn't really, I didn't have, you know, a lot of things. And so
[00:38:22] so anyway, I went out there and I worked in the skate shop. And I was just basically with a ski bump.
[00:38:26] And it was awesome. And I met my, um, my first and only ex-wife. So, uh, she was like a work exchange
[00:38:35] program for Brazil. Little spotty of the English show, weren't well. And, um, yeah, so, so I ended up,
[00:38:42] you know, working out there for basically about a year coming back and then getting on a line crew.
[00:38:47] And that's when I decided I was going to join the military. And then how do you figure out the
[00:38:51] maybe? Well, um, I tried to join the army because I had seen like everything Roberts ridge and all that kind of stuff.
[00:38:59] And, uh, I didn't know like a ton about the military. And I, you know, of course, the army's
[00:39:04] turning to give me to go on the infantry and you work your way up. And this is where it starts.
[00:39:07] I'm like, hmm, I didn't. So, a navy guy actually came out and like saw me and I kept going to the mall
[00:39:14] because the recruiting station was in the mall, um, which meant, you know, go try to get a military.
[00:39:19] I didn't work out. Get orange, Julia. So, that's kind of, it's orange, Julia still around.
[00:39:27] Do you best still look there? I think all the customers died. One like at a time.
[00:39:32] Yeah, pretty good. I didn't even do that all the time. Yeah, exactly.
[00:39:36] So, obviously a navy recruiter sees you. He sees, well, he's like, he starts chatting up with me.
[00:39:40] He's like coming back for lunch on one day. And he's like, oh, I have like, seeing you coming here
[00:39:45] at a bunch. Like, what are you doing? You're always like, you're like, oh, they're like, I'm trying to get a
[00:39:49] rate going the Rangers. And he's like, oh, why do you want to do that? And I was like, oh, because, you know,
[00:39:53] they're the best in the world. Like, it was none or not. He's like, let me show you a video.
[00:39:59] He brings me in there and shows me like the CJ crock is kind of video. Like, it's like the
[00:40:05] dudes doing flutter kicks in the shorts and they're like in the desert. Like, I mean, it was at the time,
[00:40:11] the coolest thing I'd ever seen in my entire life. And I was just like in Thrall. And these dudes are like,
[00:40:16] doing the triangle defense and like they're so, I was like, man, he's like, yeah, the navy seal is like,
[00:40:22] they're the best. And I was like, oh, man, what do I got to do? He's like, you got to just sign up,
[00:40:25] take a little PT test. I was like, great. Like, so I go through all this stuff. And it took me a
[00:40:31] little while to get longer to get in. Then I had wanted because I had a couple of like,
[00:40:35] little altercations in my life. I had to get cleared up. And yeah, so I ended up started doing
[00:40:41] like a bunch of research. And I was like, I could barely swim. I could swim. But I wasn't like,
[00:40:47] that kind of swimmer. So I started, I started training. I bought the, like a
[00:40:54] navy seal workout book. And I started boxing again. Because you grew up boxing? I grew up boxing.
[00:41:02] Yeah. How much did you boxing your or a kit? On and off pretty much since I was like about 10.
[00:41:08] I started in Catskown, New York. Same place, Mike Tyson learned in Catskown village boxing.
[00:41:12] There you go. Yeah. And I actually continued. I understood working out. Because if you never did that,
[00:41:19] you were working. But working in the back of the day was kind of like the toe touchers, you know,
[00:41:23] you're doing the side. It was not as like, you know, side-dificors. It is, did I?
[00:41:28] I remember getting ready to come in the navy and thinking like, dude, you know, I did whatever.
[00:41:34] Five sets of eight pull-ups like on. What a good workout. Because you just had no idea. I mean,
[00:41:38] this is like 89. So there's no, well, at least there was no information available that I had.
[00:41:43] I mean, it wasn't going to go to a library. Library, Lee couldn't get Google shit and figured out.
[00:41:49] So, and at least if you box like you knew, even if you just knew like, you got to pressure
[00:41:54] yourself. Like you obviously did you compete boxing? Yeah, I bought something. Then you knew. Like you,
[00:41:59] you knew how to push yourself hard in a workout. Absolutely. But that was like a different kind of like
[00:42:05] in the sense, basically, the workouts I was doing was running push us. So like, I was, I would get
[00:42:10] up in the morning. I would get up before work. So I had a job. I started working for a roofing
[00:42:14] contractor. Once I was working for a line guy, that job kind of foiled out and thank God.
[00:42:20] These guys were crazy. I was working on Glenn's falls. Anyway, Lauren Cruz got some crazy
[00:42:25] feefall in it. They got a lot of problems. I found myself living in a trail and Glenn's falls
[00:42:30] with this dude, Johnny's even to pay my hotel or whatever. But anyway, so I'm like, doing that.
[00:42:34] I ended up getting job for this roofing company. So I'm roofing all day. I'm working at a
[00:42:38] pizza re-at night. And on the weekends, I worked for this guy, Sange, as you gone in guy,
[00:42:43] who had a bunch of slums. And I was going there and basically patch everything up temporarily.
[00:42:48] You know, I wish FlexTate was around because I was basically flex-taving everything.
[00:42:54] Just to make it like, you know, pass the sniff test for the runners. And so I was working three
[00:42:59] jobs. And you know, Boston might ask making pizzas. And matter of fact, this is so when I went to
[00:43:05] buds, I had a bicycle that I bought from a guy that came in the pizza rea. It was a really cool
[00:43:13] specialized stump jumper. Like for the day, it was like, yeah, like the shocks. I mean, it was like
[00:43:20] they was sick. And I took that the buds with me. I bought it for 60 bucks. And at the pizza rea. And I
[00:43:26] sold that bike to Mike Everett, who was my neighbor. Yeah. Anyway, just a little factoid. But
[00:43:36] um, so if he still has that, you know, I don't know if he's been in the car. Oh, he's been my key ever.
[00:43:41] Mike Everett. The team guy. Yeah. Oh, wait. He was your neighbor. Yeah, there's my neighbor when I
[00:43:45] lived in buds. I lived in a period of beach. Okay. And I lived like two blocks over him. And how I
[00:43:49] met him was I was going through buds. Of course, I showed him, you know, I got the toe head. And
[00:43:54] I he was selling a Jeep. And I had seen the movie. I wanted a Jeep as Navy SEALs. And I didn't
[00:44:00] end of getting one. I mean, I had I wanted to say when I like bought into it like big time. He
[00:44:05] became like a Navy SEALS story. And I bought every single, I've read everything. You know,
[00:44:10] hunters and shooters, you know, men of devil's with cream. I read everything. The stories that
[00:44:14] I mean, I was like obsessed. And that's how I am on like a total immersion guy. But Mikey was
[00:44:22] I when I lived in Coronada, we was a team one. Yeah. Mike used the team one. Mike was my
[00:44:25] opportunity. One. We lived in the upstairs apartment. And he lived in the downstairs apartment. So I have
[00:44:31] many, many, many, many Mikey's. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's pretty good all. I would go over it. Like,
[00:44:37] so I met him. He's like, I went over there and I was like, Oh, how much for your Jeep is like,
[00:44:41] are you in buds? I was like, yeah, he's like, the fuck out of here. He says something like that to me or
[00:44:47] something. I was like, if we come back when you get a brown T shirt, he said to me, I ended up like,
[00:44:52] getting him known through buds. I like he's like the nicest guy ever. He's the nicest guy. And his wife,
[00:44:57] you know, his little girl, just great people for sure. It was like a hells angel and he was like on
[00:45:02] easy riders and stuff. Like, I mean, super cool people. The best. The best. But I get used to get crazy
[00:45:11] with stuff. Oh, yeah. Yeah. So I was like, so I went over. I remember I sold my bike to him. I needed
[00:45:17] like the money. I forgot. I forgot. I was, why? I was, I wish I never sold it. My sold in that bike
[00:45:24] that I bought the pizza ria and for 60 bucks. I think it sold to him for 150. So I'm ripping off
[00:45:30] it out to the business. I got you Mike. So I'm like, so I'm training for buds. I'm like, basically
[00:45:38] order the baits like 626 or whatever they were and the pants and and I just start working out
[00:45:45] and and training my ass off and I'm meeting a guy named through my recruiter. I got him
[00:45:51] drew a bit of it. You know he is? I don't know. And old team guy. He was a commander. I don't know.
[00:45:57] Yeah. And he started off in UDTs and went on and they ran this like seal,
[00:46:04] training course and Greenwich Connecticut. So you would go down there and you're supposed to get
[00:46:09] this like letter of approval or like recommendation. I never got shit from it. But it was a great
[00:46:14] experience because I met a bunch of guys that later on I would go on and serve with. And we would
[00:46:21] train like on the once a month together for like a whole weekend and I'd never done anything like that.
[00:46:26] And so it was a really good experience. I you know worked out tons and you know I'd work out
[00:46:31] the morning. We're out in the evening. I showed up the buds. You know go through boot camp.
[00:46:37] Which was like I'll never forget it because I remember the boot camp guy was like I got busted
[00:46:42] taken them lunches for the sick people and eating them tonight. And I was so hungry because I
[00:46:48] would like go work out in the bathroom. And I was so nervous about failing. And I got busted.
[00:46:55] And so they another you had all these restrictions going on. Then they had that dive.
[00:46:58] My voter rating program going on run by Jody McIntyre was right at the time. And so I would
[00:47:05] like go over there and I'd get these little passes. And then I started knowing all the scruffs
[00:47:10] waiting to go to buds. And so they would give me these passes. And then eventually I was just kind of
[00:47:13] feeling about leaving like and wandering around boot camp, right? So I started calling my my my now
[00:47:21] X-wife. Um and I'd go in the phone booth and I got busted by the chief like right before graduation.
[00:47:27] So I never really got to see my family. They restricted me before I left to go to buds or whatever.
[00:47:32] I was eating Eminem and I was like in the booth and I was like I saw my chief and I was like
[00:47:37] I just time it wrong. Literally I was walking on with like chips on my chin. I like walked out.
[00:47:42] He's like looks at me and I was like I have a pass and he's giving your pass.
[00:47:47] Okay. He's like who signed this? I was like a petty loser Johnson.
[00:47:53] Like I got it. That was my first taste of like the military has you by the balls.
[00:47:59] And yeah, so I show up a class up with class 2, 5, 4.
[00:48:04] Matter of fact, I graduated Brian Booshwa. Oh right. Yeah. Right. It was my mind.
[00:48:10] And yeah, so I classed up with them and yeah, I grew through. I think we graduated 13 original guys
[00:48:18] that class graduate was like guys like Ryan Bates and uh yeah, I remember I didn't shout through
[00:48:25] I'm making that first because I'm like hey Ryan's like he does like rassals like that.
[00:48:30] Lions then like what the fuck is the lions then you know that one's like he's like in the
[00:48:36] best shape ever like everyone's there. I was like forget be his ass like I just was like not having it.
[00:48:42] We ended up becoming super good vibes you know, but yeah, I tell a story a lot, but I don't say his name
[00:48:50] Brian, but uh it's like one of those moments where I was they were going through training and
[00:48:55] through work up training and I was running the training and there's like total chaos going on in the
[00:49:01] mountain town and there's just like everyone's getting shot up with paintball or whatever and no
[00:49:06] once making any decisions and I could already I a guy like him he stood out because he's just like
[00:49:13] we're stuck freaking stud and we're square it away and I don't think I had trained because eventually
[00:49:18] you know we trained together in GJT and whatnot so I think I kind of knew that or whatever but that
[00:49:22] wasn't he was good as an operator you know beyond GJT through he was good as an operator and I knew it and
[00:49:28] you could all you could tell like in a platoon there'd be like two guys that were good or three guys
[00:49:32] that were good or whatever and it might be the OIC it might be the platoon chief it might be the LPL
[00:49:36] or it might be some for freaking random E5 so I've been watching him and there's some total
[00:49:41] mayhem and chaos going on and he's like crouch down behind a wall and I walk over to like hey bro
[00:49:46] what's going on he's like just crazy and I said what do you think you do right now and he's like
[00:49:51] we should we should pretty strong point that building and I go why don't you make it happen he and he
[00:49:56] it was beautiful the look on his face was like oh I can't do that and he just is like hey
[00:50:05] we're strong point in that building over there and here's like you know I don't even know he's a new guy
[00:50:08] maybe he's a one cruise wonder whatever he started making calls and people just listened and they did
[00:50:12] with their supposed to do and yeah I love that guy yeah I know yeah you know I have so van Wilson
[00:50:19] he was a team guy that got killed in car crash day after we graduated but academy grad officer
[00:50:27] he was an NCAA wrestling champ monster I know we're all heartbroken we all got like tattoos
[00:50:32] the night before whatever together and you know we're all all super tight and yeah that was uh that
[00:50:40] being in buzz and that like that changed my life you know that whole that whole experience you know
[00:50:46] I was like finally like a part of something you know did you have trouble with anything you said
[00:50:50] you weren't that great of a swim or did you figure it out no I used everything except for the last one
[00:50:54] but uh my heart got been in first time every time had I not dragged another friend of mine
[00:51:01] he's getting ready to get out uh because he was he was done after that if he didn't pass that it was over
[00:51:06] for him and he was like sandbag and like crazy drag on but you that's pretty good that you were
[00:51:13] able to not really be like a water guy and pass everything yeah I mean later on I would become you
[00:51:18] know I started competing you know you know a free dive spear fishing I know around the world
[00:51:23] so I mean I that water experience and then being an STV guy which was like if they they should
[00:51:30] just have the STV at Buds like day one everyone get into this we're gonna sink in under the water
[00:51:34] into the dark you would you would you would weed out like 75% of the people a lot of people it's terrifying
[00:51:41] and so I got out went you know went to eating Delta went to the soccer medicores and then
[00:51:48] got sent to STV D1 how tall are you six four do they think about that at all I mean that
[00:51:55] this is a make sense bro no so if you don't STV is like a mini sub and it's it's a it's what's
[00:52:02] called a wet submersible which means when you're in it it's filled with water so it's not like
[00:52:07] you're in a little submarine like James Bond all listening to iTunes with with the freaking
[00:52:12] eater on it's it's like this tight they're not big they're small and they fill up with water
[00:52:21] ocean water not like one water ocean water is around you and can't move in it there's a guy in
[00:52:27] front of you and so like the dive profiles get so you know I went to STV school I crashed the STV
[00:52:34] like before I graduated which was great because I ended up becoming a backseat guy and I got to do
[00:52:37] the real world mission but I was like I'll never forget I had to officer next to me I can't remember
[00:52:44] his name he was a told dick and and he was like so bossy he's a new officer he knows he wants to
[00:52:49] believe me yeah and I'm but we drive they nap so I got the stick I'm like you know control in the
[00:52:56] ballast I'm like you know and I was like hey sir I think there's like there's something in front
[00:53:00] of us I think it was like just stay on this course and I'm like I don't know he's like it's just
[00:53:04] artifact I'm like I think that's a thing like and I was like so I was like okay fine so I
[00:53:10] like cranked celery and it like he fell right in I hit it and it was like how the middle of
[00:53:15] ocean was like one of those like rock little jetties with the with the little lighthouse on it
[00:53:21] and also it was like you know we come rocketing out and all of the water trades out like
[00:53:25] shhh I'm like hmm so I like open up the door and I like looked down there's like land
[00:53:31] I look at him he's like oh shit like we're there and so that was the end of my driving career
[00:53:38] and he was he was pissed because I did I said okay fine and I just accelerated right in
[00:53:42] it so um graduate as to be school go out to the team and you know that's when I started learning
[00:53:49] like how sophisticated that really is and how you know it's super complicated you're diving mixed gas
[00:53:58] rebriebers and open circuit all in these various profiles throughout a very long dives under
[00:54:04] under pressure and like 12 hours eight hours like yeah and you you'll switch on and off so you'll
[00:54:10] be like you know you can't be on rebrie either you know because you get oxygen tosses it
[00:54:15] it's a area you can't be on all heli-ox or nitrox or you can't be on all open circuit because
[00:54:20] I'm nitrigen our coasts so you're like in the new have these like computers with all these
[00:54:23] like lights that blink and like these huge like screens and I could never remember like
[00:54:28] I knew that double red was not good you might know that there's like double red not be like
[00:54:34] uh manually enter the air like and I'm like oh double green I think it's okay solid I'm good
[00:54:41] and so there's a guy right in front of you and you can't move so he sits in between your legs
[00:54:48] all your gear and all your equipment gets shoved in the back and then everything's pitch black so
[00:54:52] when we're training for the national tasking like everything's by memory every single thing
[00:54:58] has a not every single light has a signal you know because you're not using the under the OTS system
[00:55:04] you know because it could be heard so everything is by feel so everything begins like you know
[00:55:09] first you're in these huge tanks and then you're graduating up until you're in the ocean so
[00:55:13] everything in the pitch black so like when things get out of sync it gets very confusing and then
[00:55:20] you have to FSA at the end you have to take your rigs click it to the outside and then the sub will
[00:55:25] surface and then you like blow out closer rebrie either and kick away and then the sub leaves
[00:55:30] and then you're on the surface and then you swim ashore you know and then you have underwater
[00:55:34] painters that find you like all that kind of stuff so it was like at first like not what I had
[00:55:40] like signed up to do like meanwhile I'm like watching the news you know it's like like let's go like
[00:55:46] break and I'm like underwater like like hand signal so I wouldn't change it for anything in the
[00:55:54] world because of the team I got to be a part of what we got to do and the knowledge that I gained
[00:56:01] of that mobility platform it was something that I think like within the teams is so like niche
[00:56:08] and most people think you know because the STV guys always get like bad rap you know like
[00:56:12] golf freaking like a STV guys like but I got out of that and then I got to augment damn neck
[00:56:18] so seven days later after that deployment so yeah that it's at the the attitude of like oh
[00:56:27] STV guys like I I don't know at some point and I was pretty young when I was like yeah you know
[00:56:34] what that those guys freaking get my respect and because it's it I don't know I I mean I
[00:56:40] talked to some on my friend one of my friends particular was like who came from STV and was that
[00:56:45] whatever team we were at and I remember he's a good dude all solid dude and a like team a reliable
[00:56:53] team guy that you would want to go with you on top and one time when you're talking he was like
[00:56:58] hey man we were doing like some exercise off of Korea and you know it's winter time and he was like
[00:57:06] he's telling me he's all like he's all like in the like he starts filling up with water he's like
[00:57:11] I don't want to do the city board yeah but he's like I don't want to do this I don't want to
[00:57:16] this about whatever this is not what I don't do I don't do this anymore like literally
[00:57:19] having deal our thoughts like you wanted to quit after he's been in team for 10 years bro people
[00:57:24] bolt we've had team guys I'm gonna call him out but like there was team guys that would
[00:57:27] freak panic I mean you can get we had a we had a chief uh in my second putin who drowned and died
[00:57:36] I mean got tangled up in the lines and I bought him up you know because they would bought him
[00:57:40] up underneath stuff and it was uh it's sketchy there's lines everywhere there's stuff going
[00:57:46] everything's by merit you have all this gear all this equipment all this stuff like it is you
[00:57:50] have to maintain like a totally cool mind and then when you get into like dried out sheltering
[00:57:58] in the real world and all those kind of things like things can go sideways quick
[00:58:02] so there's no mistakes matter fact I remember we were training for that for that mission how
[00:58:07] was that 80 feet on a river my buddy my my best friend actually like we're down in the bottom
[00:58:13] I remember I had like a leak in my mask and I was like looking at I was like pointing you know
[00:58:17] doing the same like there's a problem he's like typically like you're good and I remember I was like
[00:58:23] and the whole piece goes like and I was like and he looked at me he's like there is no
[00:58:29] buddy breathing you're in like a full face mask he's like you know just remember he was like
[00:58:33] a watch you don't he just he just looks at me like you're dead like and I remember I just was like
[00:58:37] it's just blown go hey blown go from me to feet yeah it was wild these like I'll never forget
[00:58:46] your face it was hilarious that was like it was all areas you could like it never make that he's
[00:58:50] again and listen about to die we did we used to do more solops in the regular teams yeah and so
[00:58:59] you know like I did a few trips of doing lockouts and stuff and even that you know you're in this
[00:59:03] little freaking chamber and it's filling up with water and it's freezing cold and you got it
[00:59:08] you would we have we'd have like weapons bags and engine bags and all this stuff in there
[00:59:12] and it's all claustrophobic and I'm I'm I'm very comfortable in the water but like guys did not like
[00:59:18] even that and that's one you know 100th of what it's actually like because when we do that we be like
[00:59:24] cool hey we're gonna do we're gonna use sawbops for a week or whatever two weeks you guys is just like
[00:59:31] oh what are we doing for the rest of our lives sub-ops it's like you got to go through something right
[00:59:39] you know you're learning and it's got through something that's just your life and you know
[00:59:42] we we just did a 12 hour dive today cool what are we doing tomorrow that's 12 hour dive
[00:59:47] no man it never it's like you you had to I mean you you got to learn to relax like you can't
[00:59:55] freak out in those situations at all no no like you know we used to always say like those who
[01:00:02] panic first die if you panic you'll die I mean that the what happened to you know that chief
[01:00:09] that guy was he got tangled up in some lines and you know then his mask got pulled off and there was
[01:00:15] no getting it there's no getting out like there's no your it's pitch black you know and the
[01:00:19] worst is you know the bioluminous and it's like all that kind of you're like completely blinded
[01:00:23] you know and then working all the way up to a national testing with those guys and doing a
[01:00:28] lot of stuff my fact we had to we were like getting to the point we didn't know we were going
[01:00:34] we didn't know any of the information still you know still classified to this day probably always
[01:00:40] will be and you're just getting sick of the same people you know the same probs same personality
[01:00:45] the same dirty coffee cup the same dude the same you know it's the same and we were traveling
[01:00:50] all around the country in different environments like you know preparing for anything
[01:00:55] and I remember finally our chief at the time was like he called a smokers and he got
[01:01:01] big trouble because he's like okay this is it we got to settle these beef before really even
[01:01:05] of what you like well at first I didn't really have problems with anybody I was gonna just like
[01:01:12] whatever and so you want a new guy when this was going on yeah it's your first first
[01:01:18] that's freaking savage you guys and so I was like you know I'm super moto guy like I was just like
[01:01:24] so fired up and did you know what you were getting into into when you got assigned STVs?
[01:01:30] no well I had read the old books about the dudes like in the tortito like to get in
[01:01:34] covering grease and like squirting out of like a sewage pipe or whatever old school you know
[01:01:40] but that's that's really all I knew about I had no idea and yeah so like he had calls a smokers and
[01:01:47] we're getting ready to leave and he's like hey we're gonna put the board up here officers and
[01:01:51] listen doesn't matter everybody right name on the board one five minute round so by the way yeah that's
[01:01:56] just so if you don't know echo you want smokers is yes sir okay smokers is hey we're gonna it's
[01:02:01] usually boxing is it we're just gonna it's boxing yeah and they do it on ships too they do it
[01:02:06] well at least they used to you step smokers on ships and smokers on navy bases we're just
[01:02:11] gonna go and box other people yeah that's what I'm like no there was like tough back in the
[01:02:15] day but it was a great let me tell you something it leveled the scores between a lot of people
[01:02:19] and I didn't it's so everybody like got up and the other right your name on the board with the guy
[01:02:23] that you wanted to fight and of course like some guys jumped up right away and like wrote the
[01:02:28] guys named down it and I just kind of sat back I'm like and then the student gets up and he's one of
[01:02:33] the divers and he writes my name on the board I was like I didn't know yeah like a problem so I was like
[01:02:40] so we go he didn't know you freaking box and jet jet in your little well I've wore all my shit so
[01:02:46] we like so everybody starts coming to me and they're like hey like help me out they're all nervous
[01:02:50] now so I'm working with some guys a week goes by it's like a Friday night or something we show up there
[01:02:56] and and I wore like my old boxing trunks I had like no custom gloves I got all my stuff no
[01:03:02] had gear I didn't want anything out of my gold teeth like about a piece and I put it out of my
[01:03:06] coat and so when I was in the medic course I actually was Sparim Partner for Ray Mercer
[01:03:13] yeah that kind of ended my hopes of like thinking that I was gonna be like great some
[01:03:18] I don't you know you know I mean I like we just kind of think like but I like the back track a little bit
[01:03:26] I started boxing again while I was going through the medic course and for Bradford year and
[01:03:30] I ended up fighting in the North Carolina State Prison so boxing like guys like Bernard Hopkins and
[01:03:36] then they come up out of the prison programs and so I went in there and went through all the
[01:03:41] security stuff whatever and I fight like a you know various rounds kind of like a
[01:03:45] tournament style and I ended up winning to like the top guy well we was a draw with the top guy and he was like
[01:03:52] the scariest I'm telling you he was like the biggest scariest dude he was doing like 17 in the
[01:03:58] life and Ray Mercer was there and so his coach saw me boxing or whatever and was like hey
[01:04:04] Ray's like getting back in the game what he did and ended up fighting like Tim Silvia
[01:04:08] oh that's right crushed his face and Ray Mercer people remember like that guy was an animal
[01:04:14] beast he was so unfortunate lost a Kimbo slice
[01:04:18] Ray Mercer dude yeah in MMA yeah but the funny thing is they didn't box
[01:04:24] like somehow I think if I remember right Kimbo slice got him in a guillotine and Ray and Ray was like
[01:04:31] I don't know what this is but I thought we were gonna fight yeah yeah like that we're gonna fight so
[01:04:38] yeah so like I started I was so did you go like a camp with them or you just follow me so I started
[01:04:42] boxing with him on the weekends like smart partner getting them in shape and so you know I grew up
[01:04:48] watching Ray Mercer you know he devastated town in Morris and he lost the landing slow as he was a brutal
[01:04:52] dude he never been knocked down he had a head like a you know like a giant block of cheese and
[01:04:59] he was merciless I mean if you watch that knockout against Tim Morrison who was like my hero at the
[01:05:04] time before he got AIDS and but like I mean when he beat him down I remember he said he's like you
[01:05:12] can kill somebody in boxing he that's like all he said it was like very like that like
[01:05:16] does he okay or anything and when he lost the landing slow switch was controversial actually um
[01:05:22] I kind of ended his career had some more fights like along the way but um when he hit Tim Silvia he
[01:05:27] he came just whole head in I mean he if you watch that clip on YouTube I mean it's brutal so
[01:05:33] I'm in there boxing with him I have a couple great shots of me and him boxing together and he hit me so hard one time
[01:05:39] that for the first time I'm like I had like kneeled down the ground I wasn't really sure like
[01:05:42] I'm on like roller skates like I and I I remember I was like hurt for like week and I'm starting
[01:05:48] thinking to my head like man this is how like people are hitting like this level I don't
[01:05:54] I think I'll die like because I don't have a huge neck I don't know I just got like more of like a
[01:06:00] noodle neck like no matter how hard I wear it I need to iron neck or whatever but um yeah so I
[01:06:07] so I I boxed with him and then I just just stayed in shape you know whenever we didn't once I left
[01:06:11] there I had three amateur fights and then boxed with Ray then whatever went in the teams and so
[01:06:16] we show up at the smokers and so I got all my trunks I got all my stuff I got my shoes on my little
[01:06:21] tassels and everything and I got the whole thing in there and he's looking at me over there with his
[01:06:27] like you know I don't know off-brand boxing gloves or whatever and he just comes over he's like
[01:06:33] hey man that's just I don't I don't I don't know why I signed up for the I don't really have a problem
[01:06:40] with you or anything like that it's just are we good like you're dead and we got in there and
[01:06:46] I let him like punch me around for like 30 seconds I hit him one time knocked him out
[01:06:51] cold and so the shout out of my chief because like he had a big trouble because some guys got hurt
[01:06:57] and they couldn't die because they're because you know there knows his and he was like dude dude
[01:07:01] he's got beat up so yeah so it was it was a good experience you know I uh really really fortunate
[01:07:08] that I went there you know it was it was a unique experience and then I then seven days later
[01:07:12] well while underway I got told those getting getting all of that and two tf 373 so
[01:07:18] and where did you go for that? I went damn neck and I did like a train up with them and then
[01:07:25] went deaf gain of sin to an outstations and that was at the point that one was rough that one
[01:07:31] we lost Josh Harris so I was with him when he died I was right next to him and then Jason
[01:07:39] Free Walden and John Markham so that was a tough one and so you know that was my first experience
[01:07:47] in real war you know I mean what I had just come off though like the implications were so high like
[01:07:52] the intensity that if anything went wrong like literally no one's coming to get you like you know
[01:08:00] it's uh not gonna be good so but it was completely different you know uh then being shot at
[01:08:06] in the desert so um yeah was uh that was a really good experience and then it kind of just like you
[01:08:13] know up to my aspirations it got to work with some incredible people and uh do a lot of really
[01:08:18] cool missions and kind of do the stuff that I had been hoping to do from when I was sitting there
[01:08:22] at 9-11 and had an you know an envision of what I was gonna do you know what were you guys doing
[01:08:27] like pretty much just DAs yeah what's that what you're doing do a DAs uh a lot of like SRs and stuff
[01:08:34] like that a lot of overwatches for the army you know in various areas where I had a lot of remote
[01:08:38] outstations and then we were with the um the people that I later went on a work for uh we were kind of
[01:08:45] the military component for them so and so the off-temp was high. off-temp was high was 2008 so
[01:08:51] and you're just living the dream. living the dream like I mean ride in dirt bikes like I was just like
[01:08:56] living the dream uh and then uh when Josh died you know that was my first experience with losing
[01:09:02] somebody and then it just was like really real to me you know it just everything changed after that
[01:09:10] for me um and that that mission was you know he drowned uh so that was uh the way that whole thing
[01:09:19] went down how that that was tough that was that was a tough one and then the guys that were with us
[01:09:23] you know uh chasing got killed on entry uh he got shot in the stomach and then John Mark and
[01:09:30] we got shot in the neck on that so that was a huge loss in 2008 you know for the teams so
[01:09:36] so when you when you say you say like things changed or you changed or it changed what was what was
[01:09:44] like the change was it hey all of a sudden oh we're not immortal what was the change that you were
[01:09:50] yeah I think that was it like I think I had this like I had this like immortality idea in my head
[01:09:57] or I could outsmart outsmart outsmart outsmart outsmart outsmart outsmart outsmart outsmart out
[01:10:00] do anything and then uh the realism when someone's wrapped in a flag on a helicopter you know
[01:10:07] has a young guy I was just like the implications were so high I have a great picture at my house
[01:10:13] I don't have a lot of military stuff at my house I have stuff in my office but
[01:10:16] because I don't want to influence my son you know I try to you know I don't want him to feel that
[01:10:22] you know and um it's a picture that was taken by an OGA guy of me that he sent to me later on
[01:10:29] and I was standing out looking over the corn golf and uh I couldn't believe like where I had come
[01:10:37] from and that I'm like standing here with these people like these men you know like who
[01:10:43] are we're giants to me you know because like I said I became like a historian I read every book
[01:10:49] everything every there's probably not a book on the teams that I didn't read and this was before like
[01:10:54] a lot of books were coming out they're like old school books and I really believe like in the
[01:10:58] brotherhood like in the old school like do everything together kind of mentality uh
[01:11:05] matter if I could be herel he's like an old school team guy uh and he was like I never forget we're
[01:11:12] like sent drinking beer one down as a new guy and he's like he's like you and you know
[01:11:16] the other guys like you guys are like the spirit of like the old teams like the old teams like
[01:11:21] just and I I mean I was I like lived it I loved it and um so you know going to actual war
[01:11:30] though it's very humbling you know and it kind of puts you like in a place where you realize like
[01:11:35] this is like super dangerous because to be honest with you I didn't really think that way at the time you know
[01:11:44] real quick Kirby or else story because it's just awesome he's he was on the podcast and he's
[01:11:51] talking about the Phoenix program and he's like yeah he goes so he we'd we'd go up and I was talking
[01:12:00] to him because you know I have a little bit of perspective of like what doing missions or like so I was
[01:12:05] like so so how would you know what what like hot you're going into an village and he's like oh well
[01:12:12] I would I would have source tell you like H3 huts down on the right and he's like yep that's what
[01:12:16] happened I go that's cool and so there's one op there in a in a little sandpan him and one other guy
[01:12:24] and they go into this village and he and so he's telling the story and he goes yeah you know so I went in
[01:12:29] there and went into the third hut on the right or whatever it was knock the guy out I come out
[01:12:34] throw him in the boat and so I'm thinking I'm like that's cool and I go I go uh how did you knock
[01:12:39] him out he goes and he goes without misnabee I go I go how did you knock him out he goes ball peen hammer
[01:12:46] so like he's even as a webgyer he's got a ball peen hammer and it's freaking webgyer just
[01:12:51] whack it dude at the head and that's that's so bad that's so bad ass oh that was the man we're ironing
[01:12:59] the ships were wood how long was that deployment to Afghanistan that you uh I think we were so
[01:13:05] four months yeah months like working up in Rani and then when you still actually technically attached
[01:13:11] to SDV and there TAD yep yep that was our TAD so so when you got done with that deployment what happened
[01:13:18] I went into uh while I went into another bouton like basically I got home my girlfriend now wife
[01:13:27] we've been together for 15 years now um heard for TAD and she picked me up at the airport and
[01:13:35] I showed up to drop all my gear off I got my car this is coming home from deployment coming home
[01:13:39] from deployment I got picked up uh no fanfare obviously at the command like again to just get
[01:13:44] all your stuff and hung out with some of the guys for a couple of days and then headed out and
[01:13:49] I get back to the command and so I was with slab so after Josh and I got went to another base
[01:13:57] got to kind of know him and um which obviously was like wasn't icon you know looking up to
[01:14:02] whatever just like really great leader like real real quiet real steady like you know
[01:14:09] got to meet him and I was like I want to go screen and go to the command or whatever and so
[01:14:13] some guys like reached out about me you know putting my package in and all that kind of stuff and so
[01:14:18] it's like a Saturday or something I get to the I get my car get on my stuff tell my girlfriend
[01:14:23] then I'm gonna meet her and drop everything off and the master chiefs there and so he sees me in
[01:14:28] the locker and he's like come on up this is the S.D.V. Master Chief? Yeah yeah I didn't like and so
[01:14:37] I I'm down there like getting on my stuff just home from deployment like and to be honest with you like
[01:14:43] looking back like that whole like there's a lot that happened like that was like a lot because
[01:14:51] I just did back to back so I mean I was like hadn't been there in like a long time and all this
[01:14:56] stuff had gone down and here I am like checking in thinking I'm gonna like get some time off
[01:15:00] or whatever and he goes up in the office and he's okay I want to talk to you and want upstairs
[01:15:05] and he goes so you know you just got back and like yeah I just got back like right now you know
[01:15:10] and he's like so you think you're kind of like go over there and like screen is that what you think?
[01:15:16] I was like what like apparently some people had sent some emails and said hey we want him to come over
[01:15:21] above our and and I was like yeah he's like well you know they're not in charge of meening I am
[01:15:29] he says to me and I was like thinking about my headspace at the time you know I was like not in a good
[01:15:37] headspace and I was like I said something both of them inflammatory I think and he went like
[01:15:45] crazy and started like screaming I mean he came over the desk like got my face you know and he's like
[01:15:50] you'll go where I tell you to go and Donna Donna and I was like I don't fucking get out you know
[01:15:55] like I mean I had that kind of attitude and so we get in this huge thing I get the text message
[01:15:59] from the chief he tells me hey I'm gear ready on Sunday 96 hour SR I'm like okay so I like unpack my gear
[01:16:09] call my girlfriend to her I'm like packing out so I rolled right into another bulltune two days later
[01:16:16] and I was pretty bitter about that nobody like asked me how I was doing nobody was like hey I
[01:16:22] know like what's going on like or you know what I was your trip like next thing I know I'm like
[01:16:27] literally like dudes with orange vest walking around looking for me with like rubber shape like laying
[01:16:33] the bushes like I was so mad I can't describe how mad I was the only thing I could do was think
[01:16:41] about how mad I was I was being possible from a getting mad or like I would explode so I go through
[01:16:50] you know I go through that I hurt my hand and and and up rolling out of that bulltune right before
[01:16:56] the tasking I got a pretty severe arterial injury in my hand and so then I go to like he said
[01:17:04] go to trade at 86 and go to trade at this is like STV trade at or did you go to
[01:17:10] it was like standoff weapons that we had it was like no it was like STV trade at
[01:17:14] truth never forget what it's called something so you're still at STV yeah but you're in the training
[01:17:19] I'm in the training part of it's all like going to Seattle lot and you know working over in
[01:17:23] those regions or whatever and then then I got out because and then I tried to screen for
[01:17:30] while I went into the reserves immediately and then tried to screen for CAG and the reserve unit
[01:17:36] wouldn't let me go so then I try to go from the reserve unit I remember the mesh chief at the time
[01:17:41] and he wanted me to go sell res for two years and serve my time at the reserves before I can go
[01:17:46] because this isn't going to be a stepping stone everything I was trying to do is try to get the
[01:17:50] opportunity to go over there so then I ended up I want to say his name because he ended up
[01:17:56] getting a lot of trouble but I ended up meeting getting picked up and doing a job and I rack
[01:18:00] for during the I think it was a status of forces agreement that was going on at the time
[01:18:06] doing like PSD stuff so now you're a contractor so now I'm a contractor still still
[01:18:10] deserves but you're a contractor yeah and I was like picking up schools and stuff and going to
[01:18:14] schools or whatever and trying to like figure out I could like weasel my way like back into
[01:18:18] active duty that's all I wanted to do and I was just really got out of pure spite I was just
[01:18:25] so angry like and I looked back at like my state and I was like man like luckily I'm like a
[01:18:30] fairly I mean that sounded like it but I'm like a steady-headed person because I was like really like
[01:18:37] a roller coaster of emotions like I had I had just experienced all this stuff and in a nutshell
[01:18:41] and next thing you know I'm like felt like I was being shitted on you know so I am in Iraq and I'm
[01:18:49] like standing at the greed being and I see a guy who knows me and he starts talking he's like oh hey
[01:18:54] what are you doing I was like I told him when I was doing he's like give me your email I got another
[01:19:00] job for you and so I ended up going over to a contractor for the say I had and I did like almost
[01:19:08] four years over there and did you go what what did that you know from what you can say that's cool to
[01:19:15] say was that did you get some immediate training or they like hey you're good on your training
[01:19:20] what would you have to do? I was the only team guy that made it out of the training me and three
[01:19:25] other guys first of all I didn't really like I had an idea but he wouldn't tell me anything and I
[01:19:31] got how it went down was like I got a random email being like you know you've been like recommended
[01:19:36] for training can you be here on whatever the date was and I was in Iraq so I remember I went to
[01:19:43] this guy I was like a total toolbag he was like some like army guy or something and I was like oh hey
[01:19:47] I got to like get out of here I got like family health problem and he's like you can't leave here
[01:19:52] I was like I'll walk right out of this gate and I'll get on that airplane and I'm like you know
[01:19:56] own me I'll do it over at a woman so finally like they like they made me fly come air so I'm like
[01:20:02] like I do whatever I want because I was like I'm taking this job like I want this job and so
[01:20:09] I couldn't have got either made it's training so I ended up flying calm air out and I'm like
[01:20:15] rethinking everything I was a month ago like the bag that airport like there's no orange
[01:20:19] Julius is there and and I'm like one of these guys is not like the others so I fly back
[01:20:28] and two days later I'm in training and uh and I'm at a undisclosed facility and it's like
[01:20:36] go top like can you perform like show up here on the line nobody talk nobody's saying anything like
[01:20:43] nobody's like I'm in this like vending and it's like four or five weeks all over in various locations
[01:20:51] and uh I show up it was really funny because I'm checking in the hotel and one of the states and of course
[01:20:58] I'm in the lobby and I look around it's like typical contractors like you know huge like
[01:21:02] America flag had some beers like everyone's like low-prow up. Clearly like we're all here together you know
[01:21:11] everyone's going everyone brother like and like even the even the guy at the front does
[01:21:17] give a brother and and so we check into the we check we check in and and my roommate is a team guy
[01:21:25] bunny in mind and so as we're like in like he's like a good buddy of mine and I didn't even know
[01:21:32] he was there so we're there and he didn't make it but the so I get a text message from over
[01:21:40] sea is like watch the news tonight okay been loud and goes down and I'm in the hotel like no way you know and of
[01:21:48] course you know then you got all you got all the sea of experts on there and describing exactly how they did it like
[01:21:55] it was like it was like the uh there's like the captain Philips thing you know that had that dude
[01:21:59] like I forget it was like branded weather something that it was like a watermelon like swoop swinging
[01:22:04] slowly and he's like shooting it with a 50-kow like showing how like difficult it would have been
[01:22:08] to hit the watermelon but so I'm like glued to the news show up the next morning we got like selection
[01:22:14] starts and um you know PT tests all those kind of things and the quals were super hard shooting
[01:22:20] quals yeah they were very difficult like that's what got most people was the quals and then the
[01:22:27] CQB um I mean it's and then they never like there's no coaching there's no like if you don't
[01:22:34] make past these tests at this time you're just you just go away like a van just pulls up and you
[01:22:39] just leave there's no like hey bro you think you'd do better next time like I mean I've
[01:22:44] what I mean where I was there a cat guy seen guys like everybody and so I get to the end there's only
[01:22:49] four of us left and now I'm kind of figuring I'm in a total state of paranoia too because
[01:22:55] every move I ever watched about the CIA is like playing in my head you know I like turned the
[01:23:00] sink out of me for like a cable to come out like look at me and write everything like everything
[01:23:04] everybody is like everybody's on it which is kind of funny because what I went through this
[01:23:08] surveillance course and I actually got busted by like a big fat lady in a KFC she like busted me
[01:23:16] so I was like you know there is those kind of people I was doing like some countering surveillance
[01:23:23] thing and I was I was in San Diego and I was all dressed up like a bum and and I'm like sitting there
[01:23:32] and I'm all freaking dirty and shitty and and I got busted and I got busted because I had my
[01:23:39] watch on and like you know this you know it's like whoever we were surveilling whatever it was surveilling
[01:23:46] the surveillance or whatever and like we got back to the briefing they're like hey you know
[01:23:51] Jaco freaking nice watch they're like you got rolled up because that you know everyone
[01:23:57] everyone was like look you look like a bum with this freaking uh Iron Man watch on this
[01:24:01] this is the healthiest bum ever yeah this was before everyone had like the big
[01:24:06] tactical watches that everybody has now yeah but back in the day I guess this was sort of like a big
[01:24:11] tactical watch for a second so yeah the old school that's funny so not so only a few you get through
[01:24:20] this mega through yeah and so some of the guys got the opportunity to try you know they were good
[01:24:23] dudes and they hadn't tried again but the quals were like I mean were you always a good shooter
[01:24:28] yeah I was always a good shooter I don't not that I grew up like you know you're hunting like
[01:24:34] like I always laugh because now I'm like big archery hunter and stuff and and actually a hunter
[01:24:39] but we're in high growth like hunting was like you know shooting out of the back of a truck and like
[01:24:43] you're like an accord field and like you know like that was hunting like you know like our hunting
[01:24:48] gear was like you know like one of these snow suit like you bought a wall crack yeah exactly and
[01:24:54] a six bag was like Bubba um but you must have good hand eye coordination from maybe from boxing
[01:25:00] in there just going there knock the shit out of a course like that that's a legit yeah the pistol
[01:25:05] I mean the pistol shooting was like they had this one called the run down uh so it was
[01:25:11] you lined up on the 100 all right and then you would sprint to the 200 drop down two shots prone
[01:25:17] and then you'd sprint it no no no this is rifle so I thought you were talking pistol I was like
[01:25:22] day off now this is no no it's like you're at French double over nine so um no but this was a
[01:25:32] tough one so it's full kit on and then you'd start you had to have six mags and with two
[01:25:35] rounds in each mag you'd start at the 100 sprint to the 200 drop down two shots prone then sprint
[01:25:41] to the 100 two shots kneeling then sprint to the 50 two shot standing then to the 25 two
[01:25:48] headshots then to the 7 two headshots mag change in between everyone you had two minutes and
[01:25:53] minimum score 24 and a epic um that got a lot of guys and then six seconds four shots from the
[01:26:01] concealed 25 yards on the pistol so that was and you can't miss real that's kind of
[01:26:07] it's good and then there's like you know again by time you get through all that then you got like
[01:26:11] CQB so I'm like and this is the interesting thing about this is no work up it's not like you went
[01:26:16] through you came off some shooting school or you like okay hey let's get you guys all dialed
[01:26:20] in here's your test this is like hey welcome here's your test yes and you're you're basically
[01:26:24] testing the whole time because it's like a vetting and uh I was really funny because we show up
[01:26:30] and we're at like the uh the Duane Deeter thing so I thought I was done with that because I went to
[01:26:36] that mosquito you know okay you hit me have the thing in her it's a time I know this is deadly like
[01:26:41] but you know how to get into the most level one everyone's a level three it depends who you know
[01:26:45] if you got somebody a me head they're gonna hit you with it so I'm thinking I'm done with that I show
[01:26:50] up there and I'm like oh no I karate chops to the head like so we go through all that stuff we
[01:26:57] had done there's another series of calls at the end you finish that off and then you get off
[01:27:02] and a job and get ready start to point and then every two years you have to redo it
[01:27:08] and if you fail you're done so there's like this looming pressure of like I have to redo all
[01:27:14] these things and then it gets more like I went through that and then it gets more like training
[01:27:20] there's like you still have to crawl but there's more training involved but that the initial one
[01:27:24] was just the vetting out and that was tough that was some of the toughest training that I
[01:27:28] went through so now you get to that job and you're starting to conduct operations obviously there's
[01:27:35] only so much we can say about the operations you know where you're conducting him and kind of what
[01:27:40] you're doing but broadly speaking what was your what was your tasking yeah so a tasking was to
[01:27:47] protect you know see I a person out you know around the world they conduct their missions
[01:27:53] so it's intense and you work all the time there is no more atory out and there is no standing down
[01:28:00] there is no you know you're employed and it's one season two z's and then there's also like the
[01:28:07] high-vis military side we're doing the paramilitary stuff depending on what basis you're at so
[01:28:12] as a team leader in a couple of bases where it's like full on I mean it's full on military
[01:28:16] like you're you know you got a whole you got a whole team of guys underneath you and yeah it's uh
[01:28:26] looking at it from that side and looking at it from the military side is just so different like
[01:28:30] it's unbelievable and so yeah was uh or team of guys that you're talking about are not Americans
[01:28:36] yeah not Americans yeah and and you know people can say what they want about those guys and I
[01:28:42] wouldn't say I trusted all of them but you really develop a relationship you know you you rely on
[01:28:47] these guys and you know watching Afghanistan fall and it was hard you know it was hard
[01:28:52] matter fact I met some of the guys recently that got out of the country last month they reached out
[01:28:58] to me and they're here somewhere living in the refugee camp basically and they were telling
[01:29:03] me about what happened to a bunch of our guys I mean helping us the walls shishkabab
[01:29:07] spears stuff through their hearts you know I mean like brutally killed so it was uh it was tough
[01:29:13] uh a good relationship with those guys so some of them are here in the states actually
[01:29:18] funny enough like what I'm like I don't know they don't we don't use our names but one of the
[01:29:24] guys somehow like found me and like reached out to like my secretary like I was like my name is like
[01:29:30] someone's so my homied like you know looking for Mike and they said it to me I'm like
[01:29:33] take everything off the internet like yeah that's bizarre it is bizarre and you know it was uh
[01:29:44] I sat down for a matter fact what happened was I was I won't say where I was but I was in a
[01:29:51] state for work a month ago my plane gets canceled so I'm like kind of wandering around like oh my god
[01:29:59] I got like forgetting another hotel I do all this up I walk into the parking garage and I hear
[01:30:03] somebody calling me by my call sign but of course like my spidey sense is like just per cup I
[01:30:09] don't know a lot of people that know that and I like turned and Logan it's two of my guys like
[01:30:14] where I was the team leader of that place for three deployments and uh and he's like you know I'm like
[01:30:23] like what's happening right now so I ended up like going back to their house with them
[01:30:28] and having dinner at this which is like it's a wicked refugee camp I just ran into them at the
[01:30:36] airport all right so I sit down and we go off I'll show you some pictures of me with them but uh yeah
[01:30:41] they started telling me like what happened to all these guys I mean dude it's like that guy is all
[01:30:47] these ever done since he was 20 years old was work for the Americans my family's been killed
[01:30:52] houses burned down people have been beheaded I mean they've been tortured I mean it's it's it's rough
[01:31:01] this the amount of people that worked with American Afghanistan is like a massive number it's a massive
[01:31:08] number to think like oh well there's only a small amount of people that are gonna bear the burden it's like
[01:31:12] there's a massive number of people that work with Americans well if you look at uh you know kind of
[01:31:17] in my work with my foundation um if you look at the number of people that have served in the war
[01:31:22] Americans right 2.7 million Americans served in the global war in terrorism 20 years all right so 7,000
[01:31:30] died in the war over 20 years 1500 are amputated so that's 0.002026 percent
[01:31:39] 0.0056 percent are those who have died right and then you look at the fallout though from the
[01:31:46] war so we just we look at those hard numbers right but we don't look at the cost of it and you look at
[01:31:52] only 4.5 percent of them are 10 you know American veterans tempting star businesses would be
[01:31:56] out to a pernors you know there's 50,000 non-profits in North America 2 and 6 veterans on you know
[01:32:02] psychiatric medications and between 2005 and the end of 2025 25,000 guys have killed themselves
[01:32:10] so people will say well you know some of those guys were other vats or whatever you know that
[01:32:16] didn't serve in there there were Vietnam vats or it doesn't matter like that's a huge number
[01:32:22] that's every 64 minutes and so we look at those numbers on the fallout on American culture
[01:32:29] and then you got to look at the fallout on the on the host nation culture and that that will be
[01:32:35] felt for generations like and then what we did like I don't mean we but like what our nation did like
[01:32:44] we're no longer like a force of righteousness and of good like we are we are colonialists that
[01:32:53] have just destroyed the foundation in fabric and our fact I was talking to Andy said like
[01:32:58] what is it 98 percent of all people have guessed I didn't know who someone been a lot of
[01:33:02] was and didn't know 9-11 and have it right so so we just think about our cost of war
[01:33:09] but then you got to look at the long term cost of what's the displacement within societies and
[01:33:16] it's going to come home to roost I mean I was listening to there was a general who supported us when
[01:33:20] I worked on the other side of the house he was a badass my effect I have a teacher with his face on it
[01:33:27] I worked out with it all the time he was that he was a real he was committed to the cause and he was
[01:33:33] he was just just a band in them and they they tore these guys told me they just tortured them
[01:33:40] viciously and this is a guy that for for 15 years 15 years dedicated his whole life to our nation
[01:33:48] and they you know they told me what they did what they did to him and I was just like
[01:33:52] oh man it's not like there's a cost there's a huge cost you know I think the cost is felt on
[01:34:02] our our soldiers here you know I think that the enemy that we're fighting is not it's not like
[01:34:11] it's not like you know they're not like Chinese or like Russians you know these guys didn't have
[01:34:16] drones they didn't have bombers they don't have any that kind of stuff you know they they had
[01:34:23] you know weapons that were you know that they took from the Russians the 70s and run around
[01:34:28] a flip-flops and like pajamas and and the ones that fought alongside of us believed in us that we
[01:34:35] they took us at our word that we would you know that we would honor our commitment to them as a
[01:34:43] people and as a nation and think about the girls and going to school and the children and
[01:34:49] my heart breaks for it there's nothing I can do I'm a pawn I'm a minion like it in the scope of
[01:34:54] things but but I you know I think that the karma is gonna come home it's gonna hunt this nation
[01:35:03] you know I think you look I look at my little children I got you know my fifth kid about to be born
[01:35:08] and I think about what is 50 years look like right 50 years it's gonna come home it's gonna come home
[01:35:19] to us and you could see the hurt and you know what these guys I'm sitting there you didn't
[01:35:22] with them I'm eating the footbred I'm sitting in there of course I'm waiting for someone to come
[01:35:26] out and stab like a ventan in the side of my head like I cannot believe I'm in this situation but
[01:35:31] I share these pictures of like I'm like I can't first of all they're in like I'm Jack poverty
[01:35:37] all right they're like in these refugee camps where it's like no wheels on the vehicles shit everywhere
[01:35:44] and like here here you go thanks for helping us out and you know I just uh
[01:35:52] you know I have a heart for people that's my life my life is people and I see that hurt whether
[01:35:56] they're you know afghani or american or whatever um I see the hurt because it adds the global
[01:36:02] collective you know and you can everybody can feel it they can feel the whole world changing right now
[01:36:09] and you know I think that hammer is gonna come home I think it's gonna hit us right the face
[01:36:18] that's so how long did you continue to work um doing that job with OGA
[01:36:26] yeah so I yeah I did it for almost four years and uh and what was the uptemp
[01:36:35] a half when you'd going on a pump out off of your home it was I was every 60 days to 90 days depending
[01:36:42] on where I was and what I was doing sometimes I could extend it or whatever um and that's about
[01:36:48] all you could take of that job before you just got completely burned out so it's uh 60 90 day deployment
[01:36:56] 30 days home and then 30 days home mm-hmm is it yeah like when you come home how long to take
[01:37:04] you to reset and freaking enjoy your life before you're like well I gotta go back again and
[01:37:09] four days or whatever you don't you don't I never get out of that zone I would come home uh and be
[01:37:18] I was so intense you know I was I wasn't an intense person and I didn't have I wasn't on the face
[01:37:24] but I didn't I didn't live that my whole life was isolated I had like the same friends like the same
[01:37:31] people you know the same job I I didn't like I wasn't out there my I would come home and I would be
[01:37:38] very distracted like I because I always knew that I had to like leave again and then in um in
[01:37:44] 2014 I was in a really significant ordeal um I would say it was like up there in my top two or three
[01:37:54] events I had in my you know military-parameter career was uh actually I would say it's probably the
[01:38:00] top like it was the most insane gunfire and combat and carnage that I ever been involved and
[01:38:08] um you know that's when I kind of was like enough was enough from I had enough at that point you know so
[01:38:17] that's kind of when my whole world fell apart really because I didn't have that anchor anymore
[01:38:24] and that that had become my identity like when that identity went away you know I was kind of left
[01:38:30] spiral with all these experiences and skills and things and now I had no mission no purpose like
[01:38:37] uh well what was different about that event that I mean you'd had your buddies been killed before
[01:38:45] you'd done missions where there's a ton of pressure you've been in gun fights like what what why
[01:38:51] was that particular event the straw that broke the camels back because there's no community
[01:38:57] uh you know you're a gun for a higher and there's no community it's not like I come home and
[01:39:02] I'm like with the team and with all my buddies I'm in my platoon I got the people I got the things I got
[01:39:08] this culture I show up and I'm with different people from different units I got two guys here
[01:39:14] and a green beret here and a you know a CCD guy here I you know and you become friends and you yeah
[01:39:20] there was a brotherhood but then I mean I've never seen I mean I've worked with them again I
[01:39:24] may be over here you know so that so when you go home it's kind of just like oh you're just like
[01:39:28] you just get on the airplane I mean when I came home I flew through DC I still had like you know
[01:39:36] pieces of concrete like you know I was still banged up like and I just like arrive home at the airport
[01:39:43] like and then that's just it there's nobody calls this is like you okay like what's going on like
[01:39:49] how's the family like nothing you're just I'm living in a rural area by myself with my wife and
[01:39:56] kids and I'm you know there's I you feel like you have nobody your wife have any idea what's going on
[01:40:01] not I mean yeah I mean I didn't like tell her stuff but she could just tell my
[01:40:07] fact when I left and I and I resigned I um there and there was a lot of reasons for that but
[01:40:16] I remember my my daughter my middle daughter said to me mom always sits in the car and cries
[01:40:21] every day and by herself and I was like and I was like about what you know like so like I went
[01:40:29] over there and I remember I was like where are you crying in the car like what's going on and she's like
[01:40:32] you're just you're so intense like and I didn't say anything I mean I wasn't like chatting it up
[01:40:40] but I just rated it in form of intensity like at any minute I'm ready to go and yeah I mean if it wasn't
[01:40:47] for horses and what I'm doing right now I'm probably I don't know I look at the state of veterans
[01:40:53] today and I don't think that people understand it's a severity of what's happening to our culture
[01:41:01] it's especially like kind of where we come from you know and my my career is a just a fraction of
[01:41:08] you living a lifetime in that you know and but it has a huge impact on you long term and we
[01:41:17] forget about those people and like I was kind of rattling off some of those statistics like I mean
[01:41:24] if you look at having 50,000 nonprofits in North America for vets 50,000 between 2012 and the end of 2020
[01:41:34] we spent 92 billion dollars all right the top five non-profits for veterans have billions of dollars all right
[01:41:41] there's organizations in those top five that you know spend $29,000,000 dollars last year on postage stamps
[01:41:49] all right 18 million dollars on TV ads all right the the addiction rate of what I see of guys coming
[01:41:55] and applying to my program a couple hundred a year I can only look at those hard numbers right
[01:42:01] but 75% of those guys are on at least two my maximum guy had come to heroes and horses had
[01:42:07] was on 13 medications last year yet a guy come on 11 medications come off all in lose 37 pounds
[01:42:14] in 41 days in the program right nobody cares about nobody looks at any of those kind of things
[01:42:20] the joblessness the suicide and then there's a conversation about living and being alive
[01:42:26] we say oh this is a success story because you didn't kill himself and I and I looked at guys
[01:42:29] and I told me you're you're your your dead you're ready dead you haven't pulled the trigger but
[01:42:35] you're dead you're not living any form of life and you know if it wasn't if I didn't happen to fall into
[01:42:45] I guess you could say or or be directed I guess Sarah dip itously or you know
[01:42:52] I don't I don't know I don't know because I was a
[01:42:55] I was just I was so wrapped up in anger you know and I felt alone in the world because it's not like
[01:43:06] you don't have anybody around you you're just you're just done you know and you realize like
[01:43:13] you're just you're just a number you are literally if the tool breaks they throw the tool away
[01:43:18] you never hear these stories I could tell you stories about guys that have been shot and
[01:43:23] busted they're you know like a crippled and they can't even pay their bills they're living in a
[01:43:27] one room shack and you know trying to get medical payments like contractors like it's
[01:43:33] um and tie that into their military career it just becomes this cost at cocktail and uh that's why
[01:43:39] I've dedicated my life to this because I think that there's something special whether no matter
[01:43:43] what you did in the military that you went and signed up knowing that you could die in the time of war
[01:43:48] and because you believed in something and I think people don't think that means fighting for the
[01:43:52] government but I think it means fighting for your country and fighting for what is good
[01:43:58] and somewhere when that gets lost and gets twisted I think a whole person loses their
[01:44:04] anchor point and they spiral out of control and yeah I mean I
[01:44:12] yeah so that's why today the program that I run is it's so intensive and
[01:44:16] when you got out when you when you left that contracting job did you have a plan?
[01:44:24] No well yeah kind of I guess I left because I remember I was I got home and Christmas Eve
[01:44:30] and I was like putting together all this like my wife picks me up from the airport and I remember
[01:44:35] I'm driving she's driving. Who you're living on the east coast of this country? No I'm living
[01:44:38] Montana and snowing out and she's driving and she just starts like hysterically cry and like
[01:44:44] you know what's your problem and she's like are you okay and I'm like yeah I'm fine and she's like
[01:44:51] I just like I can feel your energy coming off you're like a furnace right now I was like I'm fine
[01:44:57] like and she's like okay like well we got to like you know put the Christmas stuff together
[01:45:02] I got extended so I've been on like a long trip so Christmas Eve I go back and I remember I'm like
[01:45:08] it was the frozen the frozen thing. So you want to talk about Frankenstein?
[01:45:14] I've been like I had the frozen car like I'm trying to put the wheels on like and I remember I was
[01:45:19] shaking so bad and I was like I was just sewing my head because you know after that we
[01:45:24] you know some things happened we got to the suicide bomb went off and all these things that happened
[01:45:28] and I remember like I just I couldn't down regulate I mean I just couldn't down regulate
[01:45:35] even just driving in the car I felt like I was there like everything was happening around me
[01:45:40] you know when you said that 30 days coming home for 30 days I can remember coming home off of
[01:45:46] deployments and it takes like a 30 day period to where you're like okay like my first deployment
[01:45:53] to Iraq we were there was this big paranoia about getting you know IE deed when you went
[01:45:58] under bridges or ambush when you went under bridges and so you know you'd always kind of like
[01:46:03] take a little breath before you'd go under a bridge in a in a convoy and I remember when I
[01:46:09] came home you know I'm like I'm not trying to say I was freaking out or anything but
[01:46:15] when I would be driving my car from work back home and go under a bridge it'd be like
[01:46:21] you'd have that just like oh yeah I remember that just this little something in your mind right
[01:46:24] and it would take like a month for me to go away so I'm thinking you're coming home for 30 days
[01:46:29] that's not enough time to get any sort of like to what you say down grade or whatever
[01:46:35] down regular down regular there's no time 30 days is not enough to down regulate period and when
[01:46:42] you're all you're doing is coming home and you know you're going on another deployment in
[01:46:46] that 30 days you might as well I kind of feel like you might as well might even come home
[01:46:50] because it's just what is what good is it gonna do that's freaking crazy it is and it's it's
[01:46:56] it's crazy that the amount of work that's carried out by contractors around the world I don't
[01:47:00] think people understand the scope of it especially when it pertains to like you know the DIA then
[01:47:05] say the CIA like you know these institutions that use contractors yeah it's a it's a tough
[01:47:13] transition for sure and I happen to you know for me like going back to work you know I started
[01:47:19] working on a ranch I met some guys and so I would kind of like immerse myself in that and
[01:47:25] so Christmas Eve yeah so I kind of cut off your story so this is this is you just had this
[01:47:31] sort of what you called the biggest incident in your career yeah I would say one of the top three
[01:47:36] for sure like now you get into the freaking aluminum tube and you've wake up and you're in freaking
[01:47:43] Montana again I'm in Montana and I'm like and I remember I was trying to put I couldn't
[01:47:50] focus to like even put the wheels on the thing I was just so and I remember like I stayed up all night
[01:47:57] you know I got in late I got in basically Christmas morning and like the kids got out of
[01:48:00] of course you know they're like you know American consumerism like I'm not even looking at the
[01:48:06] thing ripping stuff stuff like everywhere and I'm like you know the waste like it's all
[01:48:12] it's gonna eat that so we're like you know and I remember I'm like trying to cook breakfast that morning and
[01:48:18] I've been up now for I don't know probably 48 hours or something and and I remember cooking
[01:48:24] breakfast and looking at the window and I was like my wife came and we were kind of put her arm on me
[01:48:28] and I'm trying to like be happy and everything but I just looked at her I was like I'm just like
[01:48:34] I need some more time home you know so I emails and say hey I kind of need some time home
[01:48:40] and obviously like this huge thing happened and it was huge and like you know the highest levels
[01:48:46] were involved and came overseas like so like it's not like you know they didn't know or anything
[01:48:53] and and they're like well we like need you to go back like you know take this team bubble
[01:48:58] bond and if you don't come back we're in a doctor pet and that's when I was like back to like my
[01:49:06] massager chief story you know I was like like and and I was just I was just done I really wasn't
[01:49:13] sure I had I had started you know I'd started my foundation and and so then I did a film called
[01:49:21] one EDM you had already started your foundation yeah I had filed the paper work and I hadn't
[01:49:25] run anything or done anything yet and so I did you have a vision for what the foundation actually was
[01:49:30] yeah and that's evolved significantly to what it is today but yeah so then I ended up in 2015
[01:49:40] running my first season which was like come out for two weeks go home come out for two weeks go home
[01:49:45] and so I did a film with the EDM called 180 out and I had met a guy strange I had my wife had this
[01:49:53] like mommy's workout thing I watched a video is a big hunter uh Mark C. cap and uh he was like sick
[01:49:59] because main guy yet he's main guy big artery wrote it he made a video called searching for west
[01:50:05] and it's about him being this prolific archer and how his son's born and he's kind of like
[01:50:12] thinking about why he he should be there with him and you know so I watched this video over
[01:50:16] season a bunch of guys and then he's like oh this guy lives in both minutes so I send the video
[01:50:20] in my wife she launches this like mommy's workout thing and his wife comes and strangely enough like
[01:50:29] so I was like this is the guy from the video like this is the hunting guy and so we ended up like meeting
[01:50:35] and he goes hey I want to do a video on you uh yety video and he was making all the yety videos at the
[01:50:40] time like a bunch of him and so initially it was about me like being an archery elk hunter or whatever
[01:50:47] and uh and then he got to know me and he's like I want to like do it on your standing up this
[01:50:51] foundation on your first season and that first season was I don't know how that year didn't kill me
[01:50:58] honestly uh I mean it was one of the it was probably the hardest year I've had my entire life
[01:51:05] I got to you know I bought my house basically broke no paycheck I started trimming trees for a guy
[01:51:10] I'm like working on the side like you know my relationship was like touching go I was you know
[01:51:16] started chewing horses I'm trying to bring these vets out I'm self-funding everything
[01:51:21] I have basically down to you know a few thousand dollars in the bank account and uh I ended up meeting
[01:51:29] a gentleman that over over a beer totally randomly for a friend of mine that gave me 25,000 dollar check
[01:51:36] and before it gives me the check and I was 24,500 in debt with a nonprofit and I never met
[01:51:42] this guy before I'm a way to Wyoming the super national geographic and I got a huge fight I'm charging
[01:51:47] up my credit cards non-profit just supposed to raise money the people donate and you use that money to do good
[01:51:53] I didn't really know anything about that so I started it on profit and started putting my own money into
[01:51:58] the nonprofit and going broke I missed that page so I'll never forget this guy comes I got horses on
[01:52:05] trailer I'm heading in the Wyoming it's shoot for national geographic pack and some guys
[01:52:10] buddy calls me up oh stop and get a beer with this guy I'm like I can I'm just like a lot of
[01:52:14] problems right now and I couldn't pay for the vets to come back so I don't these vets feel as to come back
[01:52:19] and the last words I have in my wife was like I'm doing this and I'm charging up the cards and
[01:52:23] I'm gonna finish when I start out and I don't care what it costs I'll care if we sink the whole family
[01:52:27] I'm doing this I'm finishing this so on my way to Wyoming my buddy's like hey dude it's marine
[01:52:33] he's like let's get a beer with this guy and I and I refuse refuse he keeps persistently calling
[01:52:38] me so finally I stopped I could have one beer with the guy I said there I kind of talked for like
[01:52:42] I don't know 45 minutes I was like I got a gig cone he's like can I talk to you outside so
[01:52:47] I go outside he looks at me he goes he wanted to pet the one of the horses he's allergic so he puts
[01:52:52] a glove on he's out there petting it both he got it looks him he goes you're the worst nonprofit guy
[01:52:58] I've ever met my life and I've been working with charities for 40 years and I was like of course
[01:53:04] my ego's like you know far how like you know Darium but he was right I was I didn't know what I
[01:53:10] I didn't know anything and he hands me a check and he goes I want you to call me I like what you're trying to
[01:53:17] do so it gives me a check I drive down the road look at it's for 25 grand and that's what I knew I was doing the
[01:53:23] right thing and so you know I think like initially looking back I think really I was like trying to
[01:53:30] find a way to help myself you know and because I I felt so lost you know I just I felt lost I had no
[01:53:39] purpose I had no mission you know and working with horses and she went horses and just that world
[01:53:46] just took me out of where the focus was all of myself and my focus became on managing these animals
[01:53:55] and learning about them and learning and learning about myself through the animal I didn't really
[01:54:00] know that then because my my the guys that I was with were a force fear and repetition you know
[01:54:07] they were old school cowboys put me on horse has given bucked off kicked and all those things
[01:54:11] and whiskey trache and that was perfect for me at the time but you know through that relationship over
[01:54:18] the years horses became a mirror reflection to who I was you know because they're a pre-animal
[01:54:25] and they're designed to stay away from things with eyes in front of their head you know they're
[01:54:29] instinctually highly intelligent so we really very stupid of course this is not manimal and but
[01:54:37] instinctually they're highly evolved and so you know I brought these guys out I finished out the
[01:54:42] season with them I start the next season I start getting some fundraising behind me I have the first
[01:54:48] class I guy leaves the two weeks goes home to Odies and dies army officer and dies in his house Odies
[01:54:56] he was a lieutenant and so then I extended the program to realize I still have this letter I wrote
[01:55:05] the class and so I extended and today the program is now 41 days long I'll kind of skip ahead to that but
[01:55:13] what I realized is that it's actually struggle that gives everything in life value and so
[01:55:19] everything designed for veterans is designed to take the struggle away like people that wanted
[01:55:22] to help me wanted to take the struggle away when it was the re-engaging in the struggle that helped
[01:55:27] me re-establish a foundation and who I am as a person or who I was and I really just became an
[01:55:34] identity I had lost a baseline to that connection with myself and you know so many time the job
[01:55:42] is what you do but a purpose is how you live your life and so when that job went away I didn't
[01:55:46] have that purpose because I never really learned that you know that deeper connection to
[01:55:55] something that is you know I think that that's what makes us human I think that we live in
[01:56:01] sort of our minds and we live a series of ideas and we we level up through all these things and we
[01:56:06] get some stuff and we get some therings and we get to some places we achieve some heights but at the
[01:56:12] end of the day when it's all said and done the real question is like what is it all for what is
[01:56:19] meaning in life and I think when those identities fade and people stop waving the flag and
[01:56:26] nobody really cares that you're in the air force for 20 years and it's you know nobody cares
[01:56:31] that you were overseas like you kind of life kind of goes on everything spiral side of control and
[01:56:36] your the problem is always you and I think that you know now today looking at what happens over
[01:56:43] 41 days it's really one long continuum conversation with yourself who am I as a person because
[01:56:49] you know the average person I was reading yesterday spends between 15 and 23 years in front of the
[01:56:55] TV okay all right I started like I started like I started I was I was verifying it this morning
[01:57:04] because I was like that is the craziest thing ever because the average person lives well let's say
[01:57:09] 80 80 years that's 30,000 days right so if you spend between 15 on the low end or 23 years
[01:57:18] watching television right then you're not working for 24 hours right you have eight hours of sleep
[01:57:24] every day and then you know ages one to five what are you doing you should off the floor you're
[01:57:28] putting your pans you don't know anything you came talk right here it's like wandering around
[01:57:31] people stuffing you in seats and putting your clothes on you right and then they do the same thing
[01:57:36] to you when you're old right so you got to knock off a few years at the end where they're
[01:57:39] putting weird things in you and putting diapers on you and you're kind of revert back right so how
[01:57:44] much time do you really have well I was just crunching some rough math so between 37 and 38 years
[01:57:54] roughly because you spend you know what is it 419 hours on the toilet you know you spend you know
[01:58:02] a year and a half showering you know there's all these other things so that you look at
[01:58:08] I mean the question is like what is this all about you know and and what I really is is that
[01:58:15] success and failures are one and the same you can have a success and that success can be the worst
[01:58:21] thing that ever happened to you and you can have a failure and that can be the worst thing that ever
[01:58:25] happened to you because the byproducts are the same they inhibit growth and they stop evolution
[01:58:31] because you have an experience then you perpetuate that identity associated with that experience
[01:58:37] and then you live and create your future so human beings are constantly the victim of their own
[01:58:44] choices and everything is society is saying no it's not your choices it's everything else around you
[01:58:50] and so you know over 41 days I always say like I don't have any ideas for you I'm not advertising
[01:58:58] come to me and I'm gonna tell you what to do I say come here and I'll put you in a place what you're
[01:59:04] gonna learn what that is and I'm not gonna judge you for whatever the outcome is because that's
[01:59:09] your life to live that's your 37 years that you have get off the TV but the state of the
[01:59:16] American veteran is absolutely in dismal condition I didn't know a lot about non-profits when
[01:59:25] I started it matter fact I didn't know anything and along the way I've met every crop
[01:59:30] wire and charlatan from here to the Rio Grande because it's it's a people make billions off the
[01:59:37] backs of other people's pain I'm sorry if you serve 10 years in the military the answer for you
[01:59:44] is not too float in the tube and he don't it's like or you know to go to Texas and you know shoot
[01:59:50] a deer that's tied to a tree in front of a corn feeder like nothing's more healing than that right like
[01:59:56] you know I'm sorry like and people hate me for saying that my thing is like your your own
[02:00:02] fuck you like I don't care like because I see it I see the state of these guys that show up
[02:00:09] and they are completely fractured and they've been to 15 16 institutions they're on this they've
[02:00:15] been injected with that they're on these pills they're on these psych meds are on this Medicaid they're
[02:00:19] on this and I look at them like the pandemic of suicide in the veterans community can't be
[02:00:27] understated and the numbers like I don't even know if you would ever even be able to find the
[02:00:31] real numbers really but it's substantial you know and this whole catch thing you know 22 a day like
[02:00:39] like if you're doing 22 push-ups a day for veterans suicide you're an asshole like 22 push my
[02:00:46] kick into a hundred he's eight okay like I'll be just have some dignity and then it's like you know
[02:00:52] you're on there filming like hey guys fats are killing themselves shout it to my sponsor
[02:00:57] from my new t-shirt I'm gonna be doing 22 push-ups today new lycra by the way going on my 10%
[02:01:02] use my code Bob and I mean this is the world that we're living in and I'm like we have to get back
[02:01:10] into the business of developing human beings you know we have a we have a desire you know human
[02:01:19] beings are now in such a state of like hyper complexity where everything is integrated to everything
[02:01:25] is connected that there is no individualality there is no original thought you become an
[02:01:31] amalgamation of everything that you've heard and been exposed to but you really do nothing right
[02:01:36] like the jury's out like wake up do hard work learn about yourself turn the shed off like
[02:01:42] meditate like you know eat a carrot every now and then like and life is gonna be pretty good for you
[02:01:48] um doesn't mean it's gonna be easy but you'll have the built-in tools and you'll be
[02:01:54] going to learn about your higher self and you know people can say like you know oh this is like
[02:02:00] woo magic or whatever but like there is like I don't care you're in war like you got the
[02:02:05] spidey senses what is that what is that what is that thing what is meaning right what is this
[02:02:12] what is this thing meaning that we all have we all gonna answer that question at some point in
[02:02:16] our life whether you get hit by a you know a scape order like and whack your head in the curb or
[02:02:21] you die combat or you you know eat yourself to death like you're all going to face those those
[02:02:27] things and to me the heroes journey is the journey of learning about yourself and using those tools
[02:02:33] to overcome the external circumstances that you face and so like over the 41 days like we have
[02:02:41] you know that every guy walks at least 80 miles in the program just to meals
[02:02:45] they'll spend 22 days in the wilderness they won't eat a piece of sugar they won't eat dairy they
[02:02:51] won't eat they won't have juice they will only eat meat vegetable salt water and black coffee and
[02:02:58] they will learn to meditate looking to an ice tank every single day they will start today with
[02:03:05] mindfulness they'll read books they'll go through leadership courses they'll learn to shoe horses
[02:03:09] ride horses they'll learn to see themselves and working with wild moustangs they'll be put in
[02:03:13] very dangerous the situations all these are just tools to shift focus from a person that is
[02:03:19] always looking out for answers to a person that is looking in for answers and then using those answers
[02:03:26] to then change the material world around them with their choices that are authentically
[02:03:31] theirs and that's called purpose and when you start to do that years always the dragon that steps
[02:03:39] out right in front of you right the dragon steps out in front of you and and then you find out
[02:03:46] what you really want it because everything is designed today to keep you from knowing what you are like
[02:03:52] social media doesn't exist if you're not there the internet doesn't exist if you're not there
[02:03:57] you are the energy source that feeds your own demise so so you give your energy to feed your
[02:04:06] own destruction and then you complain about the very thing that you're feeding when it's always you
[02:04:13] you're the one I always tell people like oh god like the guys I did to wait or something
[02:04:17] isn't that you know whatever it's like it's like oh god he's not there if you're not there
[02:04:23] you feed it you are feeding and you are clothing and you are arming your own captors you are and
[02:04:30] everything is designed to keep you sound asleep consume consume consume consume consume yeah yeah yeah
[02:04:39] food moment let's get something you know everything is designed to fulfill these physical desires
[02:04:44] that then override you from searching from the real energy source that the people that are
[02:04:50] aware know of they know I need you to feed what I'm building you will serve serve serve
[02:05:00] as the cog you know gigantic organism and you will give your energy 40 50 years of and you
[02:05:09] get your little plaque thanks for Bob play of the month and then what you go down to self-order
[02:05:18] and you sit there and you just wait your car you're sitting in the same traffic yeah
[02:05:26] maybe it's a Ferrari so what you're in the same traffic and maybe get a little bit of better beef
[02:05:33] you know maybe this one was massage by 50 Japanese ladies or whatever right it doesn't matter
[02:05:38] it doesn't matter because then the fear starts to build and then the clock just starts going
[02:05:47] in the next thing you know what are they doing they're like ah it's too late it's too late
[02:05:52] you've missed the meaning of life you've missed it and veterans are out there like perpetuating
[02:05:59] these identities that's why I don't do like you know these guys they show up and it's just like
[02:06:04] dude you got out in 2005 it's 2020 too okay they're putting chips and people's brains man
[02:06:14] no one cares about the logistics department and boggerman 05 that you know may or may not have been
[02:06:24] ordered right like like think about the numbers you would think that every veteran is burned and
[02:06:29] every veteran has been amputated 1500 amputees 0.0026% of veterans have been amputated
[02:06:38] there's billions of dollars of organizations to help they have be dated billions
[02:06:42] we got this guy a wheelchair ramp a ramp how about like a ramp made of like wood like that's like
[02:06:54] 800 bucks right but but but this is what's happening we have to get back to where we start to
[02:07:00] developing ourselves push ourselves away reunite as a community and start getting serious about
[02:07:07] human development and begin giving our energy to things that matter like our food our water
[02:07:13] our shelter like the community around us doing things that are good turning off that stuff don't
[02:07:19] spend 23 years of your life in front of the TV like we have to change we have to change our minds
[02:07:27] we have to change our bodies we have to we have to become the governors of our own perceptions
[02:07:32] we're no longer the governors our own perceptions perceptions they create actions and
[02:07:37] behaviors and they're being governed by something else and you know my message is that I don't
[02:07:44] have the answers but you do and the jury's out on greatness it's it's it's spattered on walls
[02:07:52] and caves and books and tablets throughout all of mankind the jury is out no thy self
[02:08:00] know thyself there's a reason why everybody wants your energy because you're building an empire
[02:08:08] and an empire just turns out that you're it's unwitting prisoner and you can walk away
[02:08:14] and you can let yourself out and you can change you can do it we can do it and I'm not going to
[02:08:21] sit back and be a participant and watch generation like I'm nobody special I'm nobody of notoriety
[02:08:28] I'm not like all's ideal is I believe in the dignity of the human experience and there's people
[02:08:36] that I have done some really great things throughout all of the history of mankind and they did it
[02:08:41] by knowing themselves and then whatever you know we love to watch the brave hearts and we love to
[02:08:47] watch the patriots and we love to be that person be that person it's not about dying when
[02:08:52] being being burned at the stake when you're 23 we'll do you spend 23's your life watching TV that's
[02:08:56] a great 23 years that a guy like William Wallace had he was able to do that because he
[02:09:01] understood it something dradano van Bruno who was burned at the stake by the Catholic Church
[02:09:06] in the 1500s for writing the Pope of vote he he looked at them when they were going to burn
[02:09:12] him at the stake and they cut his tongue out and they nailed it to over his head they were
[02:09:15] getting ready to burn him they try to get him to recount you know that the earth revolves around
[02:09:20] the sun and all these things you know that was heresy and he looked at him and he understood
[02:09:25] the deeper meaning of life and he said it's not his last words what it's not eyes who is afraid
[02:09:32] it's you and then they let the fire what a badass way to go you know so I've just dedicated my life
[02:09:41] to you know right now the program is a 41 day long program you know at the end of it we have a
[02:09:46] Lakota sweat lodge I've had the opportunity to get to know some of those medicine men and you know
[02:09:54] that's an ancient tradition that is 16,000 years old that dates back and you know they say you go
[02:10:01] into the womb of the earth and when you come out you know you're reborn and it's it's really like
[02:10:08] it's like an insane sauna that has chanting and all those other kinds of things and you
[02:10:15] you're in there in the heat and you kind of go the heat brings you from the kind of physical into
[02:10:18] the spiritual and so every guy will pass through those windows and they'll do a four window
[02:10:24] ceremony upon graduation and then and then people are like and then what and I'm like and then go and
[02:10:30] live your life because now you know and if you want to go participate in those same things
[02:10:35] you can do it but not ignorantly because you know you know that wow I'm creating my own experience
[02:10:43] like the the whole idea of free will I believe is what project Earth is all about it's about free will
[02:10:53] well the experiment in free will is coming to an end because everybody's been programmed everyone
[02:10:59] it's coming to an end and I'm not going to let it come to an end of my life I'm going to take power of
[02:11:06] that because free will is powerful I could get up on this table right now sell my rental car illegally
[02:11:11] to a chop shop and go climb out of Everest I could do anything anything but people do nothing
[02:11:17] they do nothing they don't understand the power that they have instead they give that unknown
[02:11:22] power away and then they blame life and they've they've become the victims of this experience we can
[02:11:28] change we can change right now people can change and in turn the goodness can be restored the goodness
[02:11:37] of this nation you know the goodness that made you sign up and say you know what I want to fight
[02:11:41] against the evil I want to stand again if I lose my limit if I get burned if I get I don't care
[02:11:46] I want to do it and and return to those values that represent not only as us as Americans but
[02:11:52] us as human beings and you know that's that's that's that's my message you know to the world
[02:12:00] is like that book right there about face wake up and turn around and do 180 degrees from what you're
[02:12:08] doing and your life will change you will change it will change and it will change for the better
[02:12:15] take that journey reject the easiness of life that is being sold because it is a poison and it is
[02:12:22] a cancer and and you will maybe you'll be rich maybe it doesn't it won't matter because you will
[02:12:30] be wealthy and heart and wealthy and mind and wealthy and spirit you know and that's uh
[02:12:36] you know that's kind of what I want to share with the world well so what's this look like first question
[02:12:41] do you need to know how to write a horse to show up no no matter fact like the majority of
[02:12:49] guys come up very you can see you know you know every even written horse before in their life
[02:12:53] had you written horses before when did you start writing horses I had one horse growing up
[02:12:58] I never I wrote it like a couple times and that was about my experience that was it
[02:13:03] and then you're I'm going for this uh yes so was the introduction horses so I did not meet some
[02:13:08] uh I was uh right before I got out so this is like 2013 I ended up meeting some cowboys
[02:13:14] uh with horses in the back country and I got to know them and they invited me to the right
[02:13:19] I met him on a hiking I was just hiking with my daughter and I met him and that's how I
[02:13:24] started shooting horses so I first started shooting horses with a guy on a tip and table so they
[02:13:29] put him into a huge machine tip them on their sides and then I just my job was around like the
[02:13:33] wheel grinder and I was just like helping out and eventually I started learning how to shoot horses
[02:13:37] and start Colts and these guys like I kind of thought initially they were all about like helping
[02:13:42] vets and all this kind of stuff they were like the most like crooked human beings I've ever met
[02:13:47] in my life like real legit crooks you know because the equine business is tough like in the cowboy
[02:13:54] world and all that kind of stuff so um but I did learn a tremendous amount those guys were
[02:13:58] mentors to me you know all that should decide and then um and then I just did these sort of
[02:14:04] ride horses all the time obviously every single day a day in and day out yeah I mean I like I said
[02:14:09] I just crossed my 18th wilderness on a horse you know so uh I we have 70 horses today
[02:14:15] I've been breaking in training while Mustangs for five years now like straight from the wild
[02:14:20] and I always tell people like if you like you're like a legit tough guy like you're like
[02:14:24] I will put you in there with a completely wild horse and you're gonna find out real good
[02:14:29] how tough you are because the horse is immediately kind of sensitive you're afraid and like I had
[02:14:35] this I had this horse two years ago I never did quite get him I'll show you a cool picture of him
[02:14:40] going straight up in the air and I'm on the end of this rope um he's the only horse I ever had
[02:14:45] actually like just straight up attack me um and like attack me and what what happened was is that
[02:14:53] he would like you know you get in there and he'd start moving around and if you even take one step
[02:14:57] back there one step forward okay because in the horse world you know there is uh there is a high
[02:15:04] archie you know so there's the alpha male and the alpha female and they lead the herd and then
[02:15:09] everybody else falls up's a quint land underneath so the alpha male runs it rums around looks for
[02:15:13] predators and it keeps everybody at bay and the mare's leading them to food and water in the
[02:15:16] wild the eat first they do everything first and then it slowly goes down so you're falling somewhere
[02:15:20] in the horse high archie and you know to think about horses horses the highest video two
[02:15:25] max out of any land animal on earth alright they have binocular and binocular vision they can see
[02:15:30] out of both eyes completely independently the right brain and left brain doesn't know so they're
[02:15:35] looking at something the left the right brain has no idea just like my ex-girlfriend and so
[02:15:42] but you know they uh you know when they put their heads down they can see almost 360 degrees while
[02:15:47] they're eating and but they can't see four feet front of their nose and they can't see four feet behind them
[02:15:52] um and horses does not really do one thing run so they have you know 50 liters of fluid and
[02:15:58] they're stomach and any given time which slashes around this fleet free floating intestinal
[02:16:02] system so as the horse moves that fluid slashes and slaps in the diaphragm which causes them
[02:16:07] to go to breathe in so it's boom boom so they're they're breathing in super hard and uh they
[02:16:13] can't breathe through their mouth so they breathe through their nose and their noses are
[02:16:16] flared so it's like a irram system and so horses design like you know I I can be a mile away I
[02:16:23] was not Wyoming either as well horses on horseback they can feel the vibrations in the ground
[02:16:27] and you just can see them on your bino they just they sense you alright so they're highly
[02:16:32] evolved at getting away from predators and now here comes human beings like hello I want to ride you
[02:16:36] and and so you have to one become their leader first so you have to have an ability of self
[02:16:43] leadership alright because they can sense that and then and then you know two you have to gain their
[02:16:49] trust and you gain that trust with that animal um by you know pressure and release so
[02:16:55] applying pressure that animal releasing that pressure and essentially talking to them you know so
[02:17:00] if you watch me working while the horses I can I'm doesn't really look like I'm doing much
[02:17:03] but I'm controlling the direction of that animal because in horse language whoever moves their
[02:17:08] feet first loses so what happens is especially with the students when they're first working with
[02:17:13] wild horses as the program progresses it's a couple days they get with wild animals you'll see the
[02:17:18] guy you know I don't know 20 year-grain were there whatever horse takes a step towards them you'll see
[02:17:22] him take a step back well that horse is like okay now you're my bit and in the next time around
[02:17:28] he's on you right and you know horses are are like people some are you know docile some are nice
[02:17:34] some are psychotic whatever in terms of the wild ones and so yeah I had this horse and he's
[02:17:40] you know I get them like finally where I can get him saddled and everything like that it takes
[02:17:45] me like three or four days and I could get hands on I'm certainly pick this feet up and one day
[02:17:50] he just came in and he just never was a trusting horse and I kind of pushed him more than I think
[02:17:55] he was capable of at the time and I just kind of like he was just there as I'm gonna let him
[02:18:01] like soak or just let him stand there and rest and it was a pretty rough morning and and I turn
[02:18:07] around and he just like tears back and tries to strike me him back in my head you know I kind of
[02:18:12] like fall forward and then he bites me in my back you know and kind of throws me to the side of it
[02:18:16] every you know of course I'm like can't crawl up the round pen fast enough you know like I mean
[02:18:21] that's a large beast and you know so this was three or four days into you working with them
[02:18:27] yeah and he so we we adopt him completely wild I think 28 of our 70 horses are wild horses
[02:18:33] I've been been five years ago I did a film called the 500 mile project where I rode 16 wild
[02:18:40] moustangs from New Mexico to Arizona 760 miles after trading them for three months with a couple
[02:18:47] guys and it's the story of the unpurpose horse and the unpurpose human being and so here you have
[02:18:52] the wild horse which is facing the same thing as the American veteran which is huge government
[02:18:57] monies right so there's there's you know 50 100,000 whatever it is today I haven't looked wild moustangs
[02:19:03] in captivity so in 1979 they had the wild horse had burrow act so they started running them
[02:19:08] up off the ranch lands and putting them into long-term holding facilities and today it's a
[02:19:13] 60 or 70 million dollar program and the problem's only worsening they've tried to shoot them
[02:19:18] at a helicopter with birth control and all these kind of things and and so the whole thing's a disaster
[02:19:23] and adoption doesn't really work either it works on a small scale but there's too many
[02:19:27] being produced to adopt them out so we go there and we adopt them we sort them out we figure
[02:19:34] them out and if you watch the film and the opening scenes of the films is very intense I mean
[02:19:38] these horses have never been around people so they're terrified because they're designed to run away
[02:19:42] from us and so you know through a series of shoots and sorting things you know we pick out what we
[02:19:48] want out of hundreds of them and then we load them into trailers and we're bringing back and then
[02:19:52] we start training them and those are the horses that then go into the program so you know horses uh
[02:19:58] is a mirror reflection to who you are because a horse is designed at sensing your predatory
[02:20:03] instincts so you may say I'm not scared or or maybe I am going to hurt you because I'm going to be
[02:20:11] very aggressive with you and then the animal becomes very afraid of you then you may not be per you know
[02:20:16] portraying that on the outside but on the inside that's what the horse is looking at you could look
[02:20:22] like you're totally calm but your heart's going 140 beats a minute and the horse feels that so
[02:20:27] then he starts thinking what are you going to do to me and then they'll test you because where you're
[02:20:31] going to be in the hierarchy and if you watch them in the pens you know there will be this one horse
[02:20:36] that will come along everybody's eating and soon as he starts walking over everybody goes away
[02:20:41] and there will be one horse that's like maybe I'm not going to go and this horse like double barrel
[02:20:44] kicks in music yeah I'm going to go so you're they don't you're somewhere on that scale
[02:20:50] and so horses a lot of the program happens in the 41 days with these horses without talking
[02:20:56] because what happens is the horse reflects back what you really are and so people blame the animal
[02:21:02] this horse is an idiot well you're an idiot now we don't say that sometimes I do
[02:21:10] but but these guys begin to realize and when they change their internal compass
[02:21:16] their relationship with their horse instantaneously change it is the most beautiful thing
[02:21:23] you see this union where all sudden okay you're my leader you're the alpha male or alpha
[02:21:28] mare and I'll kill myself for you and when a horse believes in you that might like some of my
[02:21:34] like rope horses and my really good horses like the one you go kind of like that video I said
[02:21:38] you're whatever you know they'll kill them so they will run for you until they die they will run
[02:21:44] through a fence they will they will do anything for you because they trust their leader
[02:21:50] but a lot of guys initially are just passengers on an animal that hates them because they hate
[02:21:55] themselves and they're not able to have that internal compass be calibrated so throughout that
[02:22:01] relationship and throughout the learning about horses they're really learning about themselves
[02:22:04] of the medium of the horse and so from day one you know guys apply to the program it's a really
[02:22:10] comprehensive application process and it's a hundred percent veterans all veterans yep and
[02:22:17] it's a it's a it's a tricky application you know most nonprofits you kind of like fill out the thing
[02:22:21] and it's like you know you like presence or being on it's like you're welcome like thanks
[02:22:25] like this is like gets in your head and then you know through that process you get selected
[02:22:30] you know kind of rate guys one to five you know we can only take so many guys you know we get a couple
[02:22:34] hundred applications a year and then and then we send them two books communicate with them every week
[02:22:39] help them lose weight change your diet we send them articles on testosterone suppression
[02:22:43] through SSRIs and medications and all these kind of unhealthy lifestyle we help them kind of
[02:22:48] level up as they're preparing and then when they arrive it's you know kind of indoctrination
[02:22:55] getting the ice tanks this is how this works this is our morning routine so you wake up it's a
[02:22:59] mile walk in the dark off the ranch they walk down to the main area the you know mobility work
[02:23:05] with Jim Jones so they designed our workout program all based you know these guys are not trying
[02:23:09] to get jacked or anything but they some of them are like straight off the mission of the kitchen so
[02:23:13] you know they they like I mean we have guys that like haven't why did a guy last year that said
[02:23:17] he had walked up a flight stairs in seven years all right so now like you're entering into like
[02:23:22] you want I mean pain when you're scoping out applicants are you trying to create a what
[02:23:30] you call it a class yeah so I create a class but I are you trying to create a class of like
[02:23:35] do you look at the people go look this guy's probably he's gonna need some help but he's probably
[02:23:40] gonna do well this other person's like like this is a train wreck over here or he just looking
[02:23:45] for train wrecks I just take the worst of the worst guy so you're looking for and I put them all together
[02:23:49] and there's no signs to that because to me it's like you to get through this you have to work as a
[02:23:54] team but it's about the individual you're on your own journey and you're gonna need other people
[02:23:59] to help you along the way but I don't care if they ever talked to those guys again a lot of
[02:24:03] amainting some of the closest friendships ever a matter of fact on the way here some guys a
[02:24:10] Canadian special operations sent me a guy and last year and he
[02:24:16] changes life this guy was in a real bad way and they've made team relationships with each other but
[02:24:24] ultimately it's about the individual because they're on the heroes journey and the heroes journey
[02:24:28] is that you have to walk through those flames you have to go through those fires you have to
[02:24:32] feel it and so you know 430 in the morning they wake up they walk a mile down to the main camp
[02:24:39] then they intentionally move their bodies they get done with that we do a meditation and then
[02:24:46] they do breath work the Wim Hof breath holding and then they get into a nice tank and then that
[02:24:50] scales up to you know they're sitting there for like 10 minutes and that's pretty rough on guys
[02:24:57] that are like straight off like and then and then it's all about horses and so then in the evening
[02:25:02] we have what we call the the Maxim Lab which is a leadership course based on stoism so I don't tell
[02:25:08] them any ideas while presenting a question what does it mean you know choose to be harmed
[02:25:12] in your harm choose not to be harmed and you haven't been what does that mean and guys will go around
[02:25:16] and let them talk things out and so throughout the program they'll do that for 40 days and then
[02:25:21] after after six days they'll head into the back country for eight days they are given a horse
[02:25:26] and a mule so it's weight six days they've been there yep they've been doing this routine
[02:25:30] they've been learning about horses well at this point everybody can load the horse
[02:25:35] and go down and run everybody can you know rain control their horse and pack a mule
[02:25:40] and understands equine medicine, trucks, trailers all that kind of stuff they get all that in
[02:25:45] six days so it's very intensive those are some long days extremely long days
[02:25:50] um matter of fact like there was like a guy with a vet came out and he's like um like
[02:25:56] there's like guys sleeping like right next to the horse like I know I look you guys come on
[02:26:02] we're not in the military now we understand up and like but but so six days of
[02:26:10] so the beginning of the program they're there they're getting all this good stuff that you're
[02:26:13] given and they're only eating like meat vegetables what do you say salt water and coffee
[02:26:19] that's it okay there's no juice there's no dairy there's no honey nothing you know and and then
[02:26:24] after six days of that then it's we're going in the wilderness yeah all the horse back
[02:26:29] with the horse you on your horse and your mule correct as a team as a team some of these
[02:26:34] guys are most they're paired together eight guys in the class are paired together and they
[02:26:36] got to pack their own stuff and then of course there's camp gear and all that stuff we have
[02:26:39] duties and all lined up for everybody and that's a progressive trip so there is no main camp
[02:26:44] so everyday they pack up and move so you know all ultra light stuff you know most of
[02:26:49] time I never use a 10 I'm just I just sleep out and let's say rains and they'll spend eight
[02:26:54] days we'll do like around eight or 90 miles on that trip then they'll come back and they'll start
[02:26:59] the next morning what's called ranch week so now they're going to learn how to rope they're
[02:27:02] going to we have you know cows they're going to learn how to rope cows how to do stock management
[02:27:06] they're going to learn more advanced riding they're going to learn how to work on a ranch how to
[02:27:10] be in working ranch and so that's called ranch week it's all about ranch stuff they'll drive
[02:27:15] tractors and they'll learn all these things in different groups throughout you know the whole facility
[02:27:19] then a lot of times we'll move we'll go to another ranch we'll help them gather and sort and
[02:27:23] ship cows and do stuff depending on what's going on so that's ranch week and then they start you know
[02:27:27] I guess you could say like phase two or something where there are another six days of training so
[02:27:32] that training is blacksmithing so they'll learn how to shoe over so they'll learn how to trim
[02:27:37] learn how to pair and learn equine medicine they'll work with wild moustangs they'll do cult
[02:27:40] starting they'll do raining they'll do more advanced riding they'll do roping well actually
[02:27:45] rope live cows and they'll learn how to you know how to manage them how to operate on a working
[02:27:50] ranch in terms of all the agricultural components and they'll learn more packing and they'll
[02:27:54] learn how to put we know seven eight ten animals out of time pull them together how to drive
[02:27:58] trucks how to drive trailers how to do chains how to run chainsaw how to run axe it all those
[02:28:02] kind of things and then then they'll head into the backcountry for eleven days and then that's
[02:28:07] it's how many days deeper we into this program right now like is the eleven days or something
[02:28:14] so is the eleven days sort of like the final days in the field yeah and that's a tough trip like
[02:28:18] it's tough on me it's tough like you know eleven or twelve days in the wilderness like that
[02:28:23] progressively moving wears on you plus the animals have their own personalities and there's
[02:28:29] you know we run our stock loose so we tie you know we hobble them and we turn them loose in the
[02:28:34] mountains and so you know you gotta get up and you gotta gather in the morning it's cold snowing
[02:28:38] in August you know all those kind of challenges last year we rode across the wind rivers
[02:28:42] or either 120 miles across one river range and that was brutal trip it was incredible but it's just
[02:28:48] tough and then you know you're chewing horses you're constantly where you build and camp you're
[02:28:51] cooking everything and it's all this you know like whole food stuff so guys are it's a tough trip
[02:28:57] and then they lead every day so every day a different guy leads he has the map he has the
[02:29:01] routes he makes all the decisions I let him fail I let him fall flat on their face I let him make
[02:29:05] mistakes as long as nobody's gonna get hurt let him feel that take you know ownership of all those
[02:29:10] kind of you know that leadership component and confidence and stuff and so and then they get back
[02:29:16] and then when they get back from that trip obviously everyone's decimated so the average guy last year
[02:29:21] lost 20 pounds in the program her record that last year was 37 pounds in 41 days and yeah and
[02:29:30] then and then the med countless 11 psych meds guy I walked away from so and then of course you
[02:29:37] have the guys on the ones season the doos season stuff like that so they get back then we wake them up
[02:29:42] at one o'clock in the morning they usually get the bed around 10 that night after we because you know
[02:29:46] horses come first so you got a doctor horses clean horses you got to do shoes you got to do
[02:29:50] all those things and then we'll wake them up driving them to a mountain make them climb
[02:29:53] saccharidrea peaks with 10,000 foot peak in the dark because the metaphor is that nobody really
[02:29:59] cares what you just accomplished because behind every mountain is another mountain and so we
[02:30:04] want them to feel that and in that video you can see the guy standing on that peak and then one
[02:30:08] guy's gonna rub in the other guy in the back you know none of that's acting or anything and I was
[02:30:12] a real emotional moment because they have lived a lifetime and it is real life it's not like you're
[02:30:18] coming here and this is fake life and I'm gonna leave and go back to real life it's all real life
[02:30:22] there is no fake life right it's all real right you put the virtual reality goggles on for nine
[02:30:28] hours that's real life right it does not time doesn't stop and so um the climb that mountain they
[02:30:35] come down pack up all their gear in the next day is graduation day so then they get into the sweat
[02:30:39] lodge so they graduate getting into the sweat lodge they go through that we do some sound stuff with them
[02:30:46] and then we have a year long take home course called stay the course or the guys I've died
[02:30:51] reading suggested reading you know fitness stuff access to an app and kind of like you know
[02:30:58] whole food eating and stuff like that and then the guys that want to we plug them into an
[02:31:04] internship and then they go for four to six weeks to Alaska why don't we Montana you
[02:31:08] totally go to work in ranches they go to cowboy outfits they go to outfiters and you know
[02:31:12] and you come and at this point in their wife when they're done they've moved on and had an
[02:31:21] interesting guy this year who gave straight out of the marine corps basically like weeks and came
[02:31:27] here and he showed up and he was like straight up like rager Rick you know yeah they're like the
[02:31:33] oakley's on you know yeah the like you were like he straight everything was the military everything
[02:31:38] was the military when he left he had left all his military clothes in my garbage bag had you know
[02:31:48] cowboy hats like the whole thing and had essentially he's been worked on his Mexican I got him
[02:31:54] I happened to know a team guy buddy of mine awesome guy and who works for a guy that has a ranch in
[02:32:01] Mexico so he's been ranching in Mexico like his whole life is like completely different I think
[02:32:07] what would happen if more people got out and immediately took on the next challenge in their life
[02:32:13] in the face of everything and where would they be today and you know that's my overarching goal is that
[02:32:19] like you know the sweat lodge is a super powerful thing and it can be terrifying how hot is this
[02:32:24] sweatlock and really hot like like really hotter than normal sauna hot oh yeah so so the rocks
[02:32:34] that they use they go out and gather the rocks there lava rocks they haven't been heated up since the
[02:32:39] last you know younger dry has impact they're our last major volcanic eruptions and you know
[02:32:47] they put them in there and there's a lot of drumming and songs they honor everything the water and
[02:32:53] earth and all those things and it's called the Anipi will come which is one of like seven sacred
[02:32:58] ceremonies so like the sun dance which is hanging by your flesh from a pole for three days with no
[02:33:06] food or water and then to come off that they hook buffalo skulls to you and you have to run into
[02:33:14] the desert until they rip out of your back these guys have all done this numerous times and then there's
[02:33:20] the you see these guys you're talking about the look guys yeah yeah yeah and they there are
[02:33:28] some of the there's some of the deepest most special people that I've ever met they are people
[02:33:32] that when you meet them you know like these people are good they're like good peat like there's a
[02:33:36] wholeness to them that is attractive like there is a balance to them and so these guys of course
[02:33:45] are terrified you know everybody's like you go into this little tiny lodge and you're in there you
[02:33:50] can't see your hand in front of your face and the heat begins to increase in the songs and they
[02:33:56] you know they welcome in you know all kinds of different things in animal spirits all that kind
[02:34:00] of stuff and when you come out how long are you in there for well the door open closes four
[02:34:05] times with the whole things like a couple hours and so then there's the then there's the vision
[02:34:10] quest where you go in there for 24 hours with no food or water alone that's and then there's the
[02:34:17] four days we've had people on our ranch that grown up there for four days with no food and
[02:34:21] water by themselves in the mountain and they sit up there in the sweat lodge no that's one of the other
[02:34:28] rights so the sweat lodge was banned in North American until 1976 it was illegal
[02:34:35] matter fact dancing was illegal native American dancing was illegal so when Columbus arrived in
[02:34:40] the North American continent there was 60 million natives here at the start of World War One there was
[02:34:45] 800 thousand left in Buffalo almost 60 million had been killed to what's to extinction so those rights were banned
[02:34:54] and it was illegal matter fact it was illegal to carry those names let's sort of like on a reservation
[02:35:00] so there's a real tradition and history you know you're not taking psychedelics or anything that's
[02:35:05] it's the heat and and it's the prayers and it does change you and it leaves an impact in the first time
[02:35:12] I ever did it I'll tell you right now I was ready to dig my way out of there like I did not like it
[02:35:18] because your mind's like of course I started watching YouTube videos you know I'm like oh no
[02:35:22] like I get it I was like I'm in a die I can't get out of like STV like no and I'm back in the
[02:35:28] black tube of death and and I it's had such an impact and I've done eight of them now and
[02:35:36] you know I've really like learned I guess like in a way to honor myself like in a way that is
[02:35:44] you know my mind my body my spirit by like what I eat and and how who I am in relationship with
[02:35:50] who I expose my life to my energy to like what I put my intentions towards like all these things
[02:35:56] begin to kind of open up to you as the weeks and of your life go on and so it's something that we've
[02:36:03] integrated into the program that's been really effective and deep do you hallucinate
[02:36:09] is that what you're talking about? So like I had an interesting I guess you could say not every time
[02:36:14] is been different not one has been the same some have been like incredible other ones I feel like
[02:36:19] I just suffered like they're all different but I actually had really interesting thing is that like
[02:36:26] I was in there and I saw a baby in the womb up here over the fire and but there's no fire.
[02:36:34] That's a hallucination I think. Well I think I'm not sure though.
[02:36:41] There's no fire the rocks are just red but you can't really see them then they're in this hole
[02:36:47] so there's no fire it's a hot rocks and they keep and then people open the door and bring them in and
[02:36:52] put them in there and then they have buffalo horns and they add the water to the keep dumping water
[02:36:56] on it with buffalo horns and they're singing drums and chanting and all and stuff and I saw like
[02:37:01] a baby in the womb like in a fetus and it appeared over the fire and I thought like oh man like
[02:37:09] like the children like are dying or so I don't know I had this like thing and then like a week later
[02:37:15] my wife found out she was pregnant and then I and Centaneously knew like that's what I saw
[02:37:22] and knew that I would have another child and I don't believe that children come from me I think
[02:37:27] they've passed through you and you know I think they're here for particular times I think we can
[02:37:32] become derail that's human beings because we you know we get enticed you know by gross materialism
[02:37:38] and all these things that detractors for ourselves and then somebody else has got to come along
[02:37:43] but yeah so so that experience has been powerful so I added it to the program and people I was like so
[02:37:49] what book did you read? who did you do? like what did you? I'm like nothing zero it's just my own journey
[02:37:54] it's all the things that I've done in my life that have helped me really become united with myself
[02:38:01] I had become homesick from whom I was as a person rather it was the wild and crazy
[02:38:05] religious stuff of the day where you know casting the dean is or whatever or it was the military
[02:38:10] or it was the agency or it was all these other experiences you know I had lost a footing
[02:38:17] and a connection to myself and now that that connection and that link has been restored
[02:38:24] you know I feel a balance that I've never felt before my life I you know I always tell people
[02:38:31] like I don't have a retirement I don't have any 401k I tell my kids I'm not paying for your college
[02:38:38] and I'm not buying you a car like I'm not doing any of those things but I will build an ecosystem
[02:38:44] here and teach you how to hunt and how to work the land and how to honor the animals and do all those
[02:38:48] things and I will support you but you're gonna have to do it yourself and yeah I'm not gonna
[02:38:54] if I go tomorrow they're like you got cancer I'm like okay I'm going to like Bob Marley like I'm
[02:38:59] just gonna be like alright cool and not poking me and sticking me and doing anything I'll just like
[02:39:04] I'm not you know so these experiences have given me a connection to a place where you find true peace
[02:39:14] it doesn't mean the world around you is peaceful but and it doesn't mean you're weak and you're
[02:39:19] some kind of like you know snowflake or whatever it's a it's a balance that you when you read
[02:39:24] about the great wars the the the sun zoos and you read the towel jeans and you read about the
[02:39:30] Alexander the Greats and you read about the people that you list season all these great people there was
[02:39:35] a balance they had they were artists they were calligraphers they were also kill you in 57 different ways
[02:39:40] but not out of anger and not out of hate and there were such a place of balance and so you know my life
[02:39:47] now is about restoring that balance and then bringing that balance to other people but I can't do it for you
[02:39:53] and over the course of 41 days you know it is a it is a is a conversation how much do you do
[02:40:01] really want it more often than not we fall in love with getting in shape you know we fall in love
[02:40:07] with being healthy or we fall in love with you know having things or whatever but we don't like the
[02:40:13] idea of what it takes to get there you know we don't like that we we don't like to feel uncomfortable
[02:40:19] and and we have to become comfortable and the uncomfortable and in turn the things that are
[02:40:24] holding you back they they dissipate and go away you know so that's what the 41 days is about
[02:40:30] yeah you know you and I didn't talk before you showed up here today and and so when like I was
[02:40:35] putting together your words and I'm glad you've hit this a couple times today and I wasn't 100
[02:40:41] percent sure but certainly I was pretty confident that idea that you are introducing situations
[02:40:50] to people that then they figure out like what the answers are to their questions and then you said
[02:40:55] it multiple times today like hey I don't have the answer for you and I can't tell you what to do here
[02:41:00] what to do there but I can take you to a place where you're going to start looking into
[02:41:04] you're going to start looking inside and you're going to start asking some questions and finding the
[02:41:10] answers yeah it's exactly not that's everybody is trying to tell you how to be you know like you
[02:41:16] go to Tony Robyn I don't want to disown your Robinson and then because he's like probably
[02:41:20] it'll send us assets ever. I'm like good luck to those assets for you for you I dare you
[02:41:28] but yeah like they're going to track you up in the mountains on four sides of the
[02:41:32] southern you get me Tony Robyn coming in there you're like dare you a challenge you Tony I saw show how
[02:41:42] they get so amped up and they spend their life watching all this stuff and all these things
[02:41:46] and going to these things but they don't actually do anything if you did one tenth of the
[02:41:50] information that's contained in your brain you wouldn't be in a situation you're in we just
[02:41:55] become addicted to getting more information you know it's like you know 12 steps to purpose like
[02:42:00] oh man like you're going to get to the end and 12 is like woo but then was a guy come out with
[02:42:05] nine steps like oh shit I got to get the other book there's only nine like you know like now
[02:42:10] with he he's got he's got nine more books to write uh to me the jury is out on what it means
[02:42:17] to really be a human but we've lost that we've lost that knowledge um in pursuit of a construct
[02:42:25] that if I if I get to the end of an idea that never was mine in my first place all achieve
[02:42:30] some end state right all retire or all achieve happiness you know maybe it's a it used to be in the
[02:42:38] 80s you know become a millionaire now if you're a millionaire who gives a shit a million bucks like I
[02:42:43] mean it's like a million bucks is like nothing nowadays right you know it's it's what was it like
[02:42:48] they're had that spending bill or whatever it's like if you took one trillion dollars you stack
[02:42:52] that on end and go a third of the way to the moon okay so 3.5 trillion goes to the moon in part of
[02:42:58] the way back right like so but there are those things like that really matter in life are
[02:43:06] are your food your water your shelter in your relationships in your life and um if you're not in balance
[02:43:13] with those things there's nothing there's no things in life that are gonna help you find a place of
[02:43:19] completion because eventually you will face the man in the mirror you will eventually no matter what
[02:43:26] you know matter how many cart no matter what it is like I was using example of like warm
[02:43:31] buff it was like laying in the desert and dying like about to die and I came like walking by
[02:43:35] with some water and I was like hey weren't get me all the money that you have
[02:43:44] and I'll give you this water you would take it he would 100% take it he wouldn't be like
[02:43:49] oh no he'd be like like he'd want it right so it puts everything in relative perspective and the
[02:43:57] most exciting adventure you can go on is the adventure with yourself that is the most exciting
[02:44:02] adventure and then your whole life opens up we spend our time like in shitty relationships with
[02:44:08] shitty people afraid to change and jobs that we hate doing things that we don't want to do
[02:44:14] to get to places that we never wanted to go in the first place and then we play and then they
[02:44:19] when I was using this yeah I'm like okay if you're depressed okay and everyone's like you know
[02:44:27] this for a while was like the mental health month and the mental health stuff was going on like crazy
[02:44:32] like you know everyone's like hey guys mental health month you know skydiving for mental health like
[02:44:38] I'm conducting a boxing clinic for mental health and bringing awareness to it and mental health
[02:44:46] so then you're like I'm depressed and it's like okay I'm depressed so then you go to the person
[02:44:50] that's in charge of the construct and they say what's a matter you don't like your life well
[02:44:56] I don't know something's wrong like hmm well we're gonna give you some things to get you back to work
[02:45:02] okay we're gonna get you back in love with the very thing that you hate it's never something is wrong
[02:45:07] with the thing the construct itself it's always something wrong with you so then you're like okay
[02:45:14] so you take this stuff and you feel good for a while and you're like butterflies and everything's
[02:45:17] going around with it and it wears off in six months and you go back and then the people tell you okay
[02:45:23] we gotta get you back in love we gotta get you back to work we gotta get you back on depressed
[02:45:27] it's never about making massive lifestyle changes like it's never about throwing the keys away
[02:45:34] getting radically committed to yourself it's always about changing you to get you back in love
[02:45:39] with the very thing that's causing the depression right it's never about like radical change it's
[02:45:46] always like hmm you have a chemical amounts so we'll give you some chemicals to get you back in
[02:45:49] balance that'll work by the way 79 bucks a month and and so I think that like we have to stop
[02:45:58] like we have to pump the brakes like you know we have to return back to the basics of what it
[02:46:05] means to be a human and you know my work with veterans is like they're basically involved in a social
[02:46:10] system right they show up to an institution it's a one size fits all right my greater goal is to create
[02:46:18] a board of the smart innovators people that that maybe there's a wellness arm like a FedEx for
[02:46:26] veterans right in the post office doesn't work where guys can say you know what red pill blue pill
[02:46:31] hmm six weeks in therapy meds this that counseling for ten years all these other things institutions
[02:46:37] meanings or whatever or maybe there's an eight week program I'm gonna go to that'll be the
[02:46:42] suckiest thing I've ever done in my life it'll be the true heroes journey but when I come out the
[02:46:48] other side I will have learned what I am and I will take that knowledge and I will begin to change
[02:46:54] the world around me with my own energy my own impetus and my own identity from the inside out we should
[02:47:02] give people that opportunity but instead you know you show up to these like you said these false
[02:47:07] profits that what are they there really really to do yeah what's scary about this is
[02:47:14] so much of the stuff that that people get like prescribed or advised it actually you know in
[02:47:25] some of the talks that you talk about like peeling away layers to get to you all those other
[02:47:30] things are actually added layers they're adding layers on top of layers on top of layers
[02:47:36] that seem to smooth things over for a month or you know three months or whatever and then all
[02:47:42] the sudden that whatever's in there is starting to burn through and cause you know costic material
[02:47:49] to rise the surface and so you're like wait a second I don't know if this is it so you go back
[02:47:53] and they say cool oh oh you got a little friction coming out little costic materials coming out
[02:47:58] cool let's put another layer on that and put another layer on that and then we you know what are you
[02:48:03] going to put over yourself you're going to put you know a car or a watch or whatever expensive item
[02:48:09] that is another layer on top of this it it's not a solution no it's not it's not it's not it's like
[02:48:19] this is set I so I just went through yesterday with my wife we like threw out like a shit ton of
[02:48:25] stuff right because the average American household has over 300,000 items in it and I walked in there
[02:48:33] you have a weird like a nerdy freaking what a statistical analytical mind well I like it I actually
[02:48:40] just watched like a big when I was traveling back from Florida about these like minimalist people or
[02:48:44] whatever and they you know of course went in there and it's like I told my wife so we were
[02:48:48] down in Florida and what does she want to do she's like obsessed with a good will we don't buy anything new
[02:48:52] but nothing and my kids nothing new zero everything we buy used or you know could build whatever
[02:48:57] but that in and of itself is an addiction right because I'm like she's like oh my gosh I got this
[02:49:03] flan on like you have like 90 flan on I should kind of know what this one was like three bucks and I'm like
[02:49:09] that's the problem right like you don't need that right so so we went we were like okay
[02:49:15] once a week we're in a target one portion of the house and get rid of stuff so yesterday we threw
[02:49:19] a wee we're taking to the good well we I mean I don't we took out an entire like four to expedition
[02:49:26] full of things okay and then like we were done I like three o'clock after noon and I looked around
[02:49:32] and I was like it doesn't even look like we took anything out I mean like how many potato pillars
[02:49:38] did we have I was like we had like nine potato pillars meanwhile and Ethiopia I'm like
[02:49:44] I'm like we had so many things and what do things represent their measurements of time
[02:49:50] their measurements of time because you have to have time expanded and energy to get that thing
[02:49:58] right and so and then I get this thing and then there's always another thing that you need to get
[02:50:03] wow the attachment for the mixture that goes in the thing that does the pasta like oh I'm doing that
[02:50:08] should have like well it's an action tag you know we'll have to add it on there and so we started going
[02:50:13] through and just getting rid of tons of stuff you know and and the scariest thing is going to be
[02:50:18] like going to my closet you know like and and realizing that wow I've spent a lot of time in my life
[02:50:25] getting these things and I'm like never have time I had a time and I'm enough time what am I doing
[02:50:30] with my time I'm using my time to get things that I don't need and so it's like Gandhi was
[02:50:35] asked the question what confuses him most about modern man he said modern man spends all his time
[02:50:40] to get money then spends all his money to get this time back that's I mean that's pretty profound
[02:50:46] right like and I remember I'm not calculous I was like a young well not not a young seal but
[02:50:52] I'd been in the team for a while and there was people I guess as sort of maybe
[02:50:58] remember the adventure racing things is that started coming out and but then that became sort of
[02:51:03] extreme sport and like that whole thing and then I thought to myself man people like work hard
[02:51:10] to get money to pay for to learn how to skydive or scuba diving I get to do that best is freaking cool
[02:51:16] like I had the whole system beat man but God did it a little bit you know it's like a man
[02:51:20] I'll do it you're working your ass off to go to this I'm literally getting paid to do that stuff
[02:51:24] in the first place I want one thing that I that I think was probably it might be it's a very important
[02:51:35] part of my life when I was in the teams I my first platoon and I like figured out to take a
[02:51:41] step back and look around I call it detachment now because I don't know that's the word that
[02:51:46] I figured out to call it but like you're in a situation there's shit going on and no no one's
[02:51:52] making a decision and I like learn hey take a step back look around and you'll be able to see
[02:51:57] infinitely more than if you keep staring down the sights of your weapon or whatever I learned that
[02:52:03] clearing oil rigs and training and then I started applying it and everything I did but then at
[02:52:08] some point I started applying it to like you know having a conversation with my platoon chief and my
[02:52:12] platoon chief starts getting mad about something I'm thinking instead of me being in the moment like
[02:52:17] in my own head getting mad back and escalating the situation and now I'm just yelling
[02:52:22] match with my platoon chief I never never never did that I'd be like oh god it chief and I would take a
[02:52:26] step back and and I feel like that was helpful and is helpful to me I guess all the time
[02:52:34] because I'm always like taking a step back and saying hey well I'm not really doing what's what
[02:52:41] am I what's driving this need to do this particular thing or what's making me do this other
[02:52:47] thing or why am I not doing something else and it seems like when you go into these extreme situations
[02:52:55] it's another time where it happens like when you're freaking dog ass tired or you're freezing cold
[02:53:00] you know it's like I was telling that story about my my SDV buddy that was just like I don't want
[02:53:06] to be doing this anymore and you take that step back you feel anything like that like in these
[02:53:11] sweat lodges where bro you can only suffer so much and then you got to just like take a step
[02:53:17] back and look at your whole life except yeah you have to let go see it's like yeah it's the art
[02:53:25] of like letting go it's art of detaching like and that's when you go from that kind of physical
[02:53:33] to spiritual where where you're no longer holding onto anything and you're just being and that's when
[02:53:41] we spend so much time asking and wanting things but no time listening just being still and listening
[02:53:55] well you know in those places you know I'm like you know your mind's going a million miles an hour
[02:54:02] and you're like I got to get high like all these things like oh this things are popping up everywhere
[02:54:05] I don't know Betty I wonder she's not who's Betty like all these things are coming right and
[02:54:11] and then also when you when you learn to quiet your mind and be still and begin to listen the
[02:54:16] things that you need for your life out of the nothingness comes to that I don't know how to explain
[02:54:22] it scientifically or by like an elaborate like whatever but I'm telling you right now the the
[02:54:29] when you look at like Jesus for instance right like Jesus really like I mean I mean Jesus wasn't
[02:54:35] a religion okay Jesus basically said love your neighbor has yourself well to love yourself you
[02:54:43] have to know who self is or you only love the idea of self so you have to know what your self is
[02:54:49] right and then the kingdom of God it's in you okay it's actually within you and then like those
[02:54:57] leaders of the day is like by the way those dudes are liars and they're gonna kill me but you know
[02:55:03] whatever so he was a cataclysm he was a nuclear bomb dropped on culture of the day okay so
[02:55:10] we think of cataclysm we think of meteorites or floods or earth fractures or whatever solar flares
[02:55:18] but a powerful idea that speaks to the core of who we all are as people is a cataclysm and he was a
[02:55:24] cataclysm of the day but his message was simple right you have to love what you have to
[02:55:29] you have to love yourself we have to know who itself is and you have to love yourself then you have to
[02:55:34] love your neighbor the same way right and then the kingdom of God it's in you it's in you so you have
[02:55:41] to go within and so what does he do he goes up there and he doesn't have food or water for 40 days right
[02:55:46] and then you know they kill him and then by the way he comes walking through walls like by the way
[02:55:51] you never die okay thanks for the message right I mean that's the message like if you look at
[02:55:59] through all about history it's always the same know that itself it's inscribed in the oracle of
[02:56:05] delhi and every year we have a different saying it heroes and horses that's on the belt buckle
[02:56:09] set the guys get when they graduate it's coveted belt buckle and everyone they have a different
[02:56:15] saying in this year is gonna is the saying is know that I sell and you know one year we had
[02:56:21] think greater than you feel you know we have all these other ones but know that I self and I think
[02:56:25] that's just kind of kind of stay there forever now I'm done making up slogans I think like
[02:56:32] know that myself is a powerful thing right and so that is inscribed in gold at the oracle of delhi
[02:56:38] 1400 BCE it hasn't nothing has changed it's set for know that myself I'll caveat that or else
[02:56:47] other people that actually know what you are will use you to create their own kingdom and enslave you
[02:56:53] that's that's what it is this is this is reminding me of uh I don't know we were doing a podcast
[02:57:01] a while ago and we asked a question something it was like legit I think it was legitimate dating advice
[02:57:07] someone was asking or they got dumped or something like this and so I was saying and I've given
[02:57:13] this answer a few times on the podcast hey when you're when you get dumped and you get broke up
[02:57:17] and you're all heartbroken I I try and explain that like hey the person that you were in love with
[02:57:25] that cheated on you or that you know ran away or whatever they did the person that you were
[02:57:31] in love with actually didn't exist they didn't exist that girl that seemed so sweet but then she
[02:57:38] cheated on you or whatever you were in love with this idea of this person and and now it's gone
[02:57:44] you have to accept the fact that the person that you were in love with actually didn't exist and it
[02:57:47] kind of is a good thing you go oh wait a second I'm all heartbroken now whom I can
[02:57:52] marry now whom I need to spend the rest of my life with oh no actually the person that I thought
[02:57:55] I was going to marry and the person I thought I was going to spend the rest of my life with didn't
[02:57:58] exist that this girl was not a good person and now I got to learn that now I can move forward
[02:58:04] but what I'm relating this to what you're talking about is when people look at themselves and they
[02:58:11] got this idea of themselves that they're kind of maybe not in love with but they at least like yeah
[02:58:16] you know I'm this or I'm that I'm a fighter I'm a soldier I'm a Wall Street dude or whatever
[02:58:23] you are you have this idea of yourself like hey you know I kind of love who I am
[02:58:29] and then there's something going on where you actually don't love that person and because you know
[02:58:36] that that person that your portraying doesn't actually exist it's a projection it's a projection
[02:58:41] and so that's a rude awakening and I think that can be a rude awakening when someone gets out of
[02:58:46] the military and is all of a sudden saying oh the person that I was which was a soldier a sailor
[02:58:54] an airman or marine that person all of a sudden they literally don't exist anymore and you can
[02:58:59] try and hang onto it but it's got it's it's not gonna be there you don't like you said you don't
[02:59:05] have your friends you don't have a word you don't have a puttoon anymore you don't have a puttoon anymore
[02:59:10] it's think about how heartbreaking it is when you don't have a puttoon anymore it's a freaking
[02:59:16] horror show it's everything I love a sailpatoon and all of a sudden you don't have a sailpatoon anymore
[02:59:22] you don't have it doesn't exist anymore for you and so you can't you you have to figure out okay
[02:59:26] what what am I really and you got a dig in there and figure that out and you know I think for me again I was
[02:59:35] always like a rebellious kid growing up blah blah blah and I always was like questioning myself and
[02:59:42] I don't know I think when when even when I was in the seal teams like there was I look at some
[02:59:49] leadership and be like this guy is whatever this this guy's not me right this guy's legitimately
[02:59:55] not me like I know who my guys are I don't know what we're like but that guy's he's not really
[02:59:59] one of us and there's a bunch of people that aren't really one of us so I always kind of felt that
[03:00:04] and it was okay when okay now I'm gonna move on to my next job whatever I got out of the navy
[03:00:09] retired from the navy but man trying to figure out trying to make sure that you know who you are
[03:00:18] and make sure that who you are isn't a construct I just used your word to the day
[03:00:23] construct I'm the one who I don't use that word that's an interesting word I don't you don't
[03:00:26] really use that word that construct that you built it might not be for real and if it's not for real
[03:00:34] that's gonna it's gonna sting and all but it's gonna sting it's gonna hurt but cool now you know
[03:00:38] that now you can figure it out now you can get in there start doing work baseline you got to hit
[03:00:44] though you got to hit the bottom of the bowl you know where where where the projection doesn't protect
[03:00:49] you anymore listen you can you can you can dress up all day put on the MMA stuff or whatever and
[03:00:54] until you know you get freaking spun kicked in the side of your head and then the projection doesn't
[03:00:58] work anymore right like and that's life we were all you know everybody's living some form of
[03:01:03] projection at some point in their life and you know the thing is as those projections fade you
[03:01:09] become depressed and you become disenfranchised and the thing is like you don't have to be if you
[03:01:14] have one job really in your life is to wake up and just be yourself and then you can't fail
[03:01:24] it's impossible like sure it doesn't mean I do dumb shit I do dumb shit I say things I have
[03:01:29] around second gas my shit I don't call my wife I should have never said that she's like honey
[03:01:34] but then she's like it doesn't matter because that's just how you are just be okay with that and so
[03:01:39] you just if everybody just woke up and just and just where there's authentic self the entire world
[03:01:45] would be a completely different place like think about like think about filters think about a filter on
[03:01:50] a cell phone right you got some like lady where like the other Botox is failing shit's going down
[03:01:56] probably was hot exosperies and Dallas like you know but you know she's kind of like that she's
[03:02:01] kind of a little trophy and then and then she puts the filter on and you're like boom right
[03:02:06] and love with the projection of themselves you know it's like the worst thing is you see
[03:02:10] everybody sitting on the bus and I'm sitting on the bus you know the today and everyone's like
[03:02:15] you can see them over there like liking they're like and they're like LOL LOL like heart hurt LOL like
[03:02:22] happy smiley face right like they're the saddest looking people you know dudes like the
[03:02:26] alleys or gross or mask is on croquet they're hair is just fucked up they got two cell phones
[03:02:31] like LOL LOL right it's all a projection it's a total projection and so like we have to stop
[03:02:39] being projections and get back to the basics of who we are but unfortunately we put projections
[03:02:46] in these places where we try to be like somebody else rather than being ourselves and that's
[03:02:52] just drawing the fabric of humanity and you know if you look at you know you look at Chinese culture
[03:03:01] they're all simulated everyone's wearing the same clothes everyone's doing the same things everyone's
[03:03:06] serving the same people they're all born from Chinese mothers they're all you know they all have this
[03:03:11] they all have this plan in place this 10,000 year destiny okay what are we trying to do we're trying
[03:03:17] to like you know we're trying to make the rent you know we're trying to like you know we're trying
[03:03:21] to pass the bill you know we're trying to you know you look at these people well I don't want that
[03:03:26] either that is a nightmare there is no individualality like what do you exist you exist to serve the
[03:03:31] state well you exist here in North America to serve the projection the projection oh I'm going to
[03:03:37] go why I'm going to buy the car so that when people see me they'll think I'm successful even though
[03:03:43] I work at in and out which I'm not no dings on and out actually props to the in and out
[03:03:48] yeah by the way then they just do some great stuff or something they would do
[03:03:53] co-vaxxers and I don't know shout out to the in and out
[03:03:55] they're good writers like you know or whatever like you you but like you'll see people will buy
[03:04:00] things and do things and extend themselves to a point to fulfill a projection and it's so empty
[03:04:07] because there's never enough there's always a new thing there's always another thing so your
[03:04:12] whole life is giving me a projection and that's why people are the quintessentially lost
[03:04:16] they are they are literally have their self standing next to them in their life and they're completely
[03:04:23] in the material realm everything is material the five senses there's nothing else beyond that so in
[03:04:30] that case I have to chase these projections down get that one get the next one get the next one
[03:04:35] so on and so forth that's why like filters and all those things like they're cancer because
[03:04:40] they they they are nothing more than a project you don't look like that you don't you're not
[03:04:46] that way like the crate it's if you take a step back and think about this hey I got a
[03:04:53] when I send a picture to my friends I'm gonna run it through a computer program that makes me
[03:04:59] look better like that's crazy because it drives it it's put us into all forms of chaos as a society
[03:05:11] right like where I mean you think about you know this whole thing on climate change everything that's
[03:05:16] happening in the world is like I think the debate is like are we causing climate change or are we just
[03:05:21] destroying the environment right well we are 100% destroying the environment um and for what
[03:05:29] so you can have like another table another mahogany table okay like or more diamonds you know
[03:05:38] because I love you and I want you to have this diamond that was mined by children
[03:05:43] in Africa it smuggled over here so that we can be together for a year
[03:05:48] and then you can take it out of everything I have but you know it's it's this whole bizarre
[03:05:53] thing where it's like we don't even care about anything except for enforcing our own projections
[03:05:59] so it's like hey maybe we shouldn't like chop down every tree because maybe what I breathe out
[03:06:04] the tree breeze in with the tree breeze out I breathe in maybe we shouldn't be dumping the chemicals into
[03:06:08] the rivers what is that almost every river in North America now contains glycophate in it right so
[03:06:14] it's bleeding in from um and pk from mass farming and agriculture the soils dying I mean I'm
[03:06:20] with ranchers I'm in rural I'm in agriculture people that's my life and you you listen to these old
[03:06:27] guys kneel down and pick up the soil dead right and where's all this stuff going where's all these
[03:06:33] things going what's happening around us is that people only care about their own projections
[03:06:40] and the very things that give them life they're destroying to further something that does only
[03:06:45] exist fictitiously as an idea and it's a scary time to be living in right now it's like you know
[03:06:52] here we are like Ukraine like Russia like look out like wow like they're coming they're gonna get us
[03:06:56] all like their actions and and it's like okay but you're really concerned about their borders but
[03:07:04] like what about like our borders like aren't those important to know only the ones in Ukraine
[03:07:13] and it's you get sold these illusions and and in turn we destroy every single thing around us
[03:07:22] including ourselves and if we don't change we're coming into an epoch we're coming into a time
[03:07:32] a real time that we will become unrecognizable to ourselves and when I see guys coming and they're
[03:07:39] on 11 medications or on 8 medications there have been in therapy for 10 years and they're unrecognizable
[03:07:45] to themselves they are unrecognizable they look in the mirror they don't know what they are
[03:07:51] they only exist as a projection of an identity and you know yeah it's like sorry for the
[03:07:59] doing gloom you know believe me you listen to this podcast little bit more we got to do
[03:08:05] we got to play there is like there is like an IT for he's like a machete like
[03:08:11] I get the the weird thing is is as you look at this stuff in a large scale
[03:08:19] all these things are in place you know when you just were saying that about vets
[03:08:25] you're on a bunch of medications and you're being basically subdued you know you're being subdued
[03:08:34] and it's not just vets it's like humans humans are being subdued look we don't really actually
[03:08:40] want you to do anything we don't actually want you to come up with your own ideas we don't
[03:08:45] actually want you to write your own freaking books we don't want you to create something what we want
[03:08:51] you to do is continue to feed our machine that we've got work and over here that's what we want
[03:08:58] we want to feed our machine and we don't want you to feed your own machine and that that's
[03:09:04] that's like what is actually happening because people spend as I don't know what you say 37
[03:09:10] years in front of a screen or whatever it was you're not gaining when you're doing that that's not
[03:09:14] for you that's for them that's what they can sell you they can sell you to whoever their
[03:09:20] advertisers are so you can buy more of their stuff that's what's happening it's your energy they need
[03:09:25] your energy see everything is energy they need you and I say they okay like corporate
[03:09:36] accresies government whatever it is marketing companies data capture people whatever you see they need
[03:09:44] your attention in your attention is your energy and that is the impetus for them to grow but if you're
[03:09:50] using your own energy to do your own thing that's problematic that's scary that's really scary for
[03:09:58] that right it's terrible and they can't have it for anybody running around so what they want you
[03:10:02] running around with a projection you need all these things to help your projection and it is
[03:10:08] this is like almost cliche right now it's cliche for me to say what I'm about to say there are
[03:10:14] psychologists and scientists and computer programmers or whatever they're called sitting
[03:10:21] figuring out literal ways to make you look at the screen more to add it to you to that that's
[03:10:29] what they're actually doing they're actually doing that they're actually doing that and you're
[03:10:33] by the way you're paying them to do it in many ways you're actually giving them money to do this
[03:10:37] so that they can get you to not think for yourself and I'm not saying like oh think for yourself
[03:10:42] come up with some crazy don't think for yourself yeah like actually think about what's going on
[03:10:46] around you instead you're just receiving what someone else is telling you which what they're
[03:10:50] telling you to do is waste more time looking at this and and and to buy whatever product it is
[03:10:55] that they're making this is what what's actually happening I think about like what have you
[03:11:00] read the middlegram experiments oh yeah it's crazy right yeah well two thirds of the people killed
[03:11:05] the person because they got a white coat told them to right so it's already figured out we already
[03:11:12] understand how to like grow human beings and to get them to give their attention and focus into
[03:11:18] developing whatever whatever it is is going for your attention needs you it doesn't exist without you
[03:11:24] I mean our founding fathers are pretty smart we the people okay you know they're interested
[03:11:31] that there's a power associated with the people you know the people united the people you know
[03:11:37] believing in the goodness and the opportunity that was afforded by this nation and and instead
[03:11:43] we we have fractured ourselves among the most trivial things and then given our energy and then
[03:11:50] we can plan about the very thing that we feed to build we can plan about it when we are
[03:11:57] responsible for paying for the bricks the prison keepers the uniforms everything and so
[03:12:03] turn your attention to something else if you took that same time you know between 14 and 23
[03:12:07] years watching TV in your life let's just say take one year out of that maybe get 22 years in
[03:12:13] Netflix and all right take one of those years and and just solely dedicated to yourself and if you do
[03:12:22] well you will regain time because time is accelerating extremely fast and it's accelerating because
[03:12:30] because time is only realized by the experiences that are contained in it right so like like
[03:12:37] you know I've heard it said like one million years with one event or 10 minutes with 50,000 events
[03:12:46] every moment of our life is filled with with with with an experience and so we realized time and time
[03:12:52] accelerates and we accelerate our own time and life it's like at the end of the day you're like
[03:12:58] man like you feel like you live the lifetime because you realized every moment of that day
[03:13:05] and none of it was spent with you none of it and so you feel disconnected all right well don't worry
[03:13:12] take a vacation down the Disney we're gonna get you patched up you know have a couple margaritas
[03:13:19] and eat four meals a day it's vacation can soon right and so this built-in acceleration that's
[03:13:27] happening that we feel in the world right now is caused because all of our energy is directed towards
[03:13:34] that and so I think that we can walk away and you know I've walked away you know I kind of started
[03:13:42] out when I first started this I didn't know it's social media I had nothing I'm like okay I'm
[03:13:45] starting a foundation like I got to get an Instagram you know so I used to look back I like the
[03:13:50] Instagram I had it was like I didn't I didn't even know what a hashtag was you know I was like
[03:13:56] it I was like it was like me like chopping wood and I'm like do work or something I had the worst
[03:14:01] things but then they kind of grew and I got to like almost 20,000 people and I was like sharing
[03:14:05] ideas and then and then I you know throughout you know my experience of going through the program
[03:14:10] every season because I'm out there doing it all right I'm not out there like standing there like you
[03:14:15] know I'm living it with the guys I'm feeling it I'm feeling ice I'm feeling the cold I'm you know
[03:14:21] I'm hitting the ground riding the cold so I'm like at 10,000, 11,000 feet I'm building the
[03:14:26] can I'm feeling every moment I'm in the sweat lodge I'm doing I'm not like this like kind of passive
[03:14:31] participant I'm there and then I just realize I have to walk away like I have to just do it so I
[03:14:39] just I just deleted it and I just walked away and man all these like anxieties and things like
[03:14:45] and what a way you know of course like my foundation has it and all those kind of things and then like
[03:14:50] I don't know like a year later I was like I'm gonna start it off again I got a message
[03:14:56] just here at the world and what do I start doing next thing I know I'm sucking back in the
[03:15:01] hole I'm in there and I'm doing this and then I just and I just stopped I was like I'm done for
[03:15:05] the rest of my life I'm never doing that again and it's like it's the battered wife's a drovita
[03:15:11] that's like that's what I had and and I looked and people can choose whatever they want to do
[03:15:15] whatever but I'm just saying for my life I needed to realize that my energy need to be directed
[03:15:21] at something else and that I wasn't being you know I wasn't fulfilling and maximizing my potentials
[03:15:27] of person because I was spending my time just start and I was like you know consciously like this
[03:15:32] is not a projection this is who I am this is but then of course I'm like I don't like that
[03:15:36] I will love handle like I'm like I'm gonna get on a side shot here with the axe
[03:15:41] then the remote will earn is here to photoshop right away like photoshop you know just you know
[03:15:47] three bucks you get the abs it's no big deal this is the freaking man wilderness filter
[03:15:52] yeah exactly exactly so you know so I'm trying to change like I we haven't bought meat from the store
[03:15:59] in four years you know I sold my beloved pickup truck to my good buddy team guy and I bought a
[03:16:07] 66 foot by 17 foot wide geothermal greenhouse and an excavator and working my land and you know we
[03:16:16] have the ranch and you know training my horses and like my kids like they don't have any tech
[03:16:21] they don't have any screen I have the iPad and many of those things teaching them the real basic
[03:16:27] things like and I started realizing how much time I was actually spending doing the things that
[03:16:34] I'm actually railing against you know and so little tiny changes one step out of time you know
[03:16:42] so do you not have a vehicle no I have a vehicle but no I had this truck I had the 75
[03:16:47] forward high boy put a 429 co-project and I was sick red lifted it was all you know it was cool
[03:16:53] guy like one mile of the gallon when I started like a bird died you know it was like that kind of
[03:16:58] truck and I loved it and I always wanted that grown up as a kid you know I mean the forward high boy
[03:17:04] was cool when I was a kid and but I sold that and I bought things and and I've really
[03:17:10] changed the relationships in my life and even the things that I exposed myself to and the
[03:17:16] content and those kind of things radical quiet time in the morning you know like like not just like
[03:17:22] working out and getting in my son or whatever but like like learning to just sit there and be still
[03:17:28] and thoughtless and then like you know get to the place where I can do that for 40 minutes without
[03:17:34] without a thought and just breathe nothing and then all of a sudden I have all these realizations
[03:17:40] about things I don't know where they come from I do know where they come from right you get plugged in
[03:17:47] that energy is real and you get plugged into it that's what guys find listen there's days in the
[03:17:52] backcountry where it's like everyone's kind of chatty and then they'll be like days where you're on a horse
[03:17:56] and it's like nobody says a word it's just like man you can like it's amazing everyone's
[03:18:05] real talking about the first like 12 minutes of a forced road march you know this is gonna smell
[03:18:10] a little bit of a little bit of a little bit like 30 minutes in dead silence for the next four
[03:18:15] hours as you just on but out you trapped in there in your own little brain do you think that you were
[03:18:20] do you think that you made the sail team or sail team is made you?
[03:18:29] probably a little bit of both well yes a little bit of both I can I can tell you like from my
[03:18:34] experience of like going through buds I was never gonna quite a never thought about quitting I was just like
[03:18:39] I was so stoked and happy like this is what we're doing this is what I'm doing I it took me a while
[03:18:46] to figure out like I wanted to be a good seal you know that's what I wanted to be once I got
[03:18:52] in the teams I wanted to be a good seal and it took me a while to figure out what that actually was and
[03:18:57] I don't think I really figured it out until probably about five years after I retired I think I would
[03:19:02] still be mod if I'm still working on it right now but you know there were different things that
[03:19:07] I did along the way where it seemed like the team guy thing to do and then as I got older and
[03:19:13] figured out oh yeah that wasn't really exactly a good team guy thing to do now there's some
[03:19:18] core tenants that never changed and I think the ultimate one is like if you're a good team guy
[03:19:24] you put your team in front of yourself and that was seem clear to me from day one and I think that
[03:19:31] that is the ultimate sort of the ultimate quality of a good team guys like oh that guy he will do
[03:19:38] he will he he's gonna put you ahead of him and if you have a platoon full of guys and they're all
[03:19:43] putting each other ahead of themselves like that's a freaking kick ass platoon so I kind of
[03:19:50] knew that I kind of felt that way like even with the friends I had growing up it was sort of that
[03:19:56] same mentality about not being selfish and not putting yourself like not looking out for yourself
[03:20:02] and and so when I got in the teams that core belief was probably it was probably an
[03:20:09] existence when I got when I was when I got in the teams of like hey you don't put yourself
[03:20:14] ahead of your friends I think that's what I was kind of that's what me and my friends were like
[03:20:21] when I was a kid and I think that was that core tenant was there so did it get honed hell yeah they
[03:20:28] got honed but I'd say it was kind of their man yeah it's like something I feel like when I showed
[03:20:37] up at buzz it was like I felt really inferior to everybody like in the sense that
[03:20:43] everyone I was like ripped and like they were like all like you know played football and
[03:20:47] everybody was like sports athletes and everyone there and I just felt so inferior I had like the
[03:20:52] shitty tattoo like everyone made fun of not my classmates but that was the shitty tattoo
[03:20:59] oh I have a I still have it I have like a transformer tattoo but it's just like a shitty
[03:21:07] outline that was done by a friend of mine like on this arm and whatever but like I got this thing
[03:21:14] and they used to say think it up here and show everyone your stupid head and then I had to get
[03:21:18] up on the truck and then they would like everyone laugh of course everyone would laugh and
[03:21:23] then say when come down and I remember we had this one chief my instructor out there for
[03:21:27] get his like he was the one that was constantly calling me out he's like get up here and try
[03:21:31] when you're stupid tattoo and I was like whatever sounds like go out there I shall
[03:21:34] am tattoo everyone did laugh and then we'd take off on the run you know kind of the thing
[03:21:38] and then one day he's up there and I was like he's like you know if I had that tattoo like that
[03:21:46] I think I would just kill myself and I was like well if I had legs like yours I would kill myself
[03:21:51] oh damn and everybody was like and then everybody laughed for me so I I proceeded to eat
[03:21:58] a mouthful of sand and I did the run every time I lost the sand because I would slowly do a little
[03:22:04] like I would stop it I have to refill refill and I'd put the sand in and I'd run but all
[03:22:11] these instructors came up to me and they were like we got props for you because that we know
[03:22:15] that like really sucks because they're like you can't drop you know and but I just kind of like
[03:22:22] going through that like I did have that belief in myself like I had a belief in myself and I would
[03:22:28] look at that the instructors not in the sense of like they're out to keep me but that like if they
[03:22:32] could be on the other side of this experience then I could be too that's all I ever thought about was
[03:22:38] like if he can do it I can do it you know it's like that was that movie the edge or whatever
[03:22:43] with Anthony Hopkins and who's the dude that just shot the guy oh Alec Baldwin he just shot
[03:22:51] it that I'm a female actually yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah but Marie did that movie the edge
[03:22:59] he's a little bit like what one man can do another man can do like and I kind of like I
[03:23:06] mean I would say I was like thinking about that movie but like in my own way I I thought like
[03:23:11] and if somebody else can be standing there with that shirt on I could be standing there with that
[03:23:15] shirt on you know and I think pressure I think those experiences just reveal who we really are
[03:23:21] and I think that everybody could make it if they had the ability to look in at that you know that
[03:23:27] fire and the gut or whatever but too often not it's too enticing to ring out I was uh I was not
[03:23:35] graded anything right I wasn't the fastest runner I wasn't the fastest one or kind like I
[03:23:39] said you I wasn't like a great athlete I was like maybe slightly below average athlete in high
[03:23:44] school and then even I got to the team so it was like I was never gonna win anything yeah so I was
[03:23:49] felt like I had to work harder and to be a good team guy and the quitting thing is crazy actually
[03:23:57] when you look at the things that happened with people like incredible athletes like I was literally
[03:24:05] above the low average athlete and I was young you know so like even if you went to college you
[03:24:10] your mortgage developed with me the difference between a 18 year old and a 22 year old is a big
[03:24:15] freaking difference but you know I I had college athletes D1 college athletes had an Olympic alternate
[03:24:24] for gymnastics which is crazy quit uh wrestler D1 wrestler quit. Ressler really? Yes.
[03:24:31] You think I think so I think so I'm actually I want my one of my swim buddies
[03:24:38] rang out in like um the after hell week in dive phase we're doing something in the pool and
[03:24:46] I'm I think we're doing buddy breathing in the pool and so I'm passing it my regulator and I'm
[03:24:51] taking two breaths and he's taking nine and this dude was from like Iowa or something he's never
[03:24:58] really the ocean before and he was super pale so he was just sunburn he looked bright red like the
[03:25:04] entire time and and so I'm doing you know taking whatever two breaths given him he's taking nine
[03:25:10] and finally he just stands up we're in four feet of water and the pool he just stands up and he
[03:25:14] goes at surface and I'm like down there and I think well okay so I stand up and he's just calling
[03:25:20] out like hey I quit I'm out of here this is I'm not doing this after hell week so that water thing
[03:25:25] can get a little bit crazy on some people yeah the water thing is legit you know I've had some so
[03:25:32] I mean I was drowned in Afghanistan and yeah I had like some I've had that happen I had some
[03:25:40] cross in a river and the a rope that I was attached to got wrapped around a rock and I'm really
[03:25:48] know how much I can say about because of the nature of where we were and all those things that
[03:25:52] were going to river I was in a river yeah and so basically I had gone down there once checked it out
[03:26:00] it was much more intense than anticipated you know and I had this like idea like about this water
[03:26:05] up and all those kind of things I'm getting studying it and there was a really there's a mission
[03:26:09] that we needed to get done that had not been successful previously and I was in this this this this
[03:26:15] space with with some guys and just kind of like really amped up on this you know first water up all the
[03:26:19] things so go down there the second time with like a hundred meters of one inch tubular nylon
[03:26:27] all tied together and right in the alice pack and the plan was that I would go upstream and offset
[03:26:34] and then swim down either side then pull the equipment set off a hoist system so that you know we
[03:26:39] could zip line all this stuff and get everybody across the sound of good so it was like a you know
[03:26:44] class for rapids way way way north and so it starts off I'm down there I got my my boots on
[03:26:53] I got my stuff in my second time now and I've been watching this thing drone footage all the
[03:26:57] things I've been observing this for a long time I understood the flow of the river and there was
[03:27:01] a dog leg which was like the point of no return like if you went there there was a huge cave and
[03:27:06] I would watch on the footage like logs like trees did go in there and like days later would be like
[03:27:12] blue come out so I knew if I went in there that I wouldn't live and so I go down there and
[03:27:21] I start going like upstream so now this is the you're executing the miss I'm well I'm doing
[03:27:25] the I'm basically doing the recon to see a proof of concept and so we're down there I got
[03:27:32] guys set up security the whole day I'm down there I'm like preling nervous I'm like whoa this is like
[03:27:36] I'm like insurance and like you know this is like really a wild place and there's huge cliffs
[03:27:42] so there's only kind of one way in this water to the to the river so I kind of start
[03:27:47] going up well I end up getting like sucked into a cave that I couldn't see it was just like a
[03:27:51] dark spot on the on the on the aerial and they like let all the rope go the rope can
[03:27:57] all tangled up around me I'm like a cat grabbing on the sides like I can't grab on anything so
[03:28:01] I'm end up making it to the beach now I can't I can't get back there's no way to get back
[03:28:06] unless I do that again I'm not going in that cave nobody has any ideas like one o'clock in the
[03:28:10] morning so finally I go up and I get the the rope and I get it taught and I'm on the beach and I'm
[03:28:17] like I sit down I have a rigor's belt on with a carabiner my boots fins and no shirt
[03:28:24] a pair of shorts and a speed out underneath because I have to contain that thing just kidding so
[03:28:33] that's a lot see it's a projection and so anyway I'm like so I'm sitting there and I can tell you I honestly
[03:28:40] felt like a lot of fear I felt afraid because like the waves were so big it was like whoa
[03:28:46] so I'm like okay okay like just like just fucking Michael helps it like you can do it that and like
[03:28:51] so I get into the water and I start like swimming as hard as I can and I was the unprepared for the
[03:28:57] violence of that water it literally swept me away and as I'm like flying down I'm like I kind of get
[03:29:06] like almost to where the dog leg is to get to the other side and so everybody's like in this
[03:29:12] water there's guys up here on this mountain and these two mountains and this is all like cliffs
[03:29:17] and it's kind of not cliff-y on the other side and you know that was the plan so as it's like
[03:29:22] turning like this I kind of get to here and there's a boulder in the center and the rope
[03:29:26] goes right around the boulder which just they're holding an anchor and I just become like a
[03:29:32] flapping parachute and it just sucks me underneath and my feet going underneath the boulder
[03:29:38] and I had a UDT life vest on so I pulled a little thing which I've never done in my whole training
[03:29:44] and I was like and it just ripped right off was like a toilet and my shoes are gone everything's
[03:29:49] gone. Fins gone shorts are gone. I'm in my speed of all this is happening very quick and I realize
[03:29:55] like I'm drowning and I try to unhook the carabiner physically can't I'm not strong enough and
[03:30:03] I'm no like cream puff like I I couldn't physically the current was so strong and I'm trying to move
[03:30:08] the rope one and a half inches to get it out of that and it was to stupid little like black
[03:30:14] issue like locking carabiner you know where I got to twist the thing a half turn and like
[03:30:19] and I'm like and I started like really I started drowning and I started seeing like you know
[03:30:24] these kind of like I guess like you would say a hallucination or whatever I started like seeing
[03:30:28] all kinds of crazy images and I started feeling like I'm going out unconscious like this is like
[03:30:33] and I remember saying like please god they'll let me like drown enough canis and and and then
[03:30:39] meanwhile these guys are like everyone's piling down off the hill like thinking I'm like dead
[03:30:44] they saw me like zip by and so they're heavowing and they're like heavowing heavowing there's a lot of
[03:30:49] rope so they end up like heavowing the rope off the rock and like I right when I'm like about to
[03:30:55] totally just drown and I remember the singing buzz dry drowning is better than wet drowning dry
[03:31:00] drowning is better I mean don't breathe in because you can be resuscitated but if you suck in
[03:31:05] your toast like all that water is going to go in your lungs you know being a medic like it too and
[03:31:11] I just have seen dry drowning is better than wet drowning and I just refused to breathe in and then
[03:31:15] awesome and I like pop up into the foam and I remember like gagging in and sucking all this foam
[03:31:21] and I'm like and I just started washing down the river again I'm just hitting rocks I'm like doing
[03:31:26] cartwheels I don't know which way is up and I'm like screaming help like to know buddy
[03:31:34] and and I'm like I remember like breathing in foam and I get to the other side which they could
[03:31:41] not access me because of the the terrain and I get to their side and I'm like I'm on land and I
[03:31:48] start like crawling you know super fast to get up on shore and then they just start dragging me
[03:31:52] on my face right they're like heav oh like and and I'm like getting dragged back into the river
[03:31:58] and so I get against this boulder there's a lot of slack in the line I do kind of like a squat
[03:32:03] like and I pop the beaner off and apparently everybody like fell down and they pull it back and
[03:32:07] they're like he's alive they thought I was dead they thought I had drowned so now I'm like in my
[03:32:13] speedo with no shoes on or anything in real bad guy land like and there's like people
[03:32:18] like lights clicking driftwood there's like and so I'm like I'm crawl underneath this like outcropping
[03:32:23] and I cover myself and mud because I saw it on predator and and I mean that's really what I did
[03:32:30] I remember you know like that scene you know and and so I cover myself and mud and I just lay
[03:32:37] there to like almost like probably an hour before first light and I'm like thinking I'm going to be
[03:32:46] the first seal that ever be captured like and I was like a fuck that and I'm like I got like
[03:32:53] sticks and like rocks like piled up and I'm just like and I'm freezing that like one of the
[03:32:59] coldest moments I've ever been in my life it was the water time what time it was it was
[03:33:03] August okay but it was cold yeah super cold and we were pretty damn close to as far
[03:33:11] north as you could go and so I'm like laying there and then I see like some nods like lights and
[03:33:20] the guys have made it around come down there scanning the shore and I like popped out and like
[03:33:24] here's like mud dude with like you know cool guy no like a speedo on no shoes well I had no shoes
[03:33:30] so like they have my bag though we got to get out of here now like some like you know we're
[03:33:36] hugging like I thought you're dead we're doing that whole thing so I get my clothes and I have no
[03:33:40] shoes on into teletooth I don't remember walking back I think I just like blacked out or something
[03:33:45] like because I was so cold and I have my shoes on and I was so you know I got my gun and got
[03:33:50] all my stuff got everything we go back get the base one of the guys there one of the OGA guys
[03:33:54] sons and team guy he runs one of the branches now so sons up we get back and he was there and he's
[03:34:02] like he's like in tears he's like gonna have a drink so we go up we go on the skiff and he's like
[03:34:09] I thought you're dead and I was like why do we do this like this is terrible like you should have
[03:34:13] never done this like blah blah so it gives me a drink we have a drink and I go back to my room
[03:34:17] and I'm like that was like whoa so back to like up and it up whatever move on well my team leader
[03:34:26] comes to me like a week later he's like hey brother I think you could do that again and I'm like
[03:34:31] I'm like sure definitely like oh my room my I'm so scared I don't want to do that like that
[03:34:36] was the worst experience of my whole life like but of course I'm like yeah I'm in definitely
[03:34:40] brother like for sure like so I started like watching call these YouTube videos and I started like
[03:34:45] river crossing all this kind of stuff I'm like okay like and so I order all this equipment from the
[03:34:51] PJs and all this stuff comes up I got throwbacks rescue stuff I'm like inflatable
[03:34:56] is protects the whole deal long story sure I go back down there to prove the concept and there
[03:35:01] is people down there so we bagged ass can't get everyone up right there now everyone's hearing
[03:35:05] about this like water mission going down and the night we were supposed to go and execute we
[03:35:12] never did do it and two hours before we left I was switched out with Josh Harris who drowned and died
[03:35:20] and I was right next to him yeah so there's a lot of little details in there I'll leave out but
[03:35:25] it was a bad deal yeah and you know that experience had an impact on me for sure and so when I
[03:35:34] did the Iron Man in 2012 one of the reasons why I did the Iron Man was because as a free diver I
[03:35:40] got into serious freediving like serious I've been as well a Mexico a do all over the world that's
[03:35:45] why you were in the team's year during that when I was contracting and but I started freediving
[03:35:50] in the teams uh matter fact I came over this whole thing called spear fishing PT because we had
[03:35:55] surf PT and I was like that's not fair it's discriminating like we should have spear fishing PT
[03:36:02] which was like greatest thing because we never got back to work on time there was always some kind
[03:36:05] of issue and so we got the day off basically I know that that only lasted for like three weeks
[03:36:14] but yeah so I I had to fell even diving around the world like I mean I was going to very deep
[03:36:19] dust you know 110 feet like killing you know tune on panaman then I spent you know three weeks
[03:36:25] and then as well a diving I always had this wreck playing in my head of what had happened when I
[03:36:31] would get in situations I got my arm caught Venezuela underneath the rock at 80 feet you know
[03:36:36] and the next thing I know it's like in my head like I'm gonna have kids I'm drowning like it was
[03:36:40] crazy I'm like I got to kick this thing so I ended up like signing up for the Iron Man because I
[03:36:46] heard like the the swim is the most terrifying thing in the world which it was no good yeah I had like
[03:36:52] a pain it's a bold statement coming from that freaking afghanist is you want a bunch of like
[03:36:58] middle-aged men and women that are like you know hate their lives and trying to find themselves
[03:37:03] like you don't want to be in the water with them because they're vicious and but anyway like I'm
[03:37:09] out there and I'll never forget it like I'm a fast swimmer I I was like finished I think 112 on the
[03:37:15] swim and Iron Man which is is really good 2.4 miles and I'm out there and I started too far
[03:37:22] and advanced for my skill and then people started swimming over top of me like I was just a
[03:37:27] random boolee I mean they literally just kicked me in the face and just there was 2400 people just like
[03:37:31] swimming and I couldn't catch my breath and I got kicked in the face my goggles got kicked off and
[03:37:37] I had like I don't like I got like guys like I like the prepatabors like you need help you know like
[03:37:41] it raises over like I'm like I can't breathe I can't breathe I can't breathe I'm like oh my god I'm
[03:37:44] back and I remember this guy was like I'm never forget it he looks at me he's an a panic like me
[03:37:50] and I'm like not panicking panicking but I'm just like I can't catch my breath because every time
[03:37:55] I try to breathe I get some like you know 45 year old ladies foot toe up my nose and so he grabs
[03:38:02] on me and he's holding on to me and I'm at this buoy and I remember he's pushing me down and
[03:38:07] I got him and the paddleboards are trying to get in and I'm like in this mix and I remember I
[03:38:12] just looked at him and I was just like in that moment I like faced it and this dude was like pulling
[03:38:19] me down and I just like grabbed him by his rubber cap and I punched him between the shoulder
[03:38:23] blades as hard as I could and he was just like just like like electric shock like hit him and I was
[03:38:28] like I just like I just started like swimming and my wife has this great shot of me coming out I
[03:38:35] look like I look like I have like PTSD when I'm coming out of the water like my I have like
[03:38:39] bags of my eyes I got news for you you did yeah I came out of the water and I was like I was
[03:38:45] like totally terrified and but I never had another about what that ever got and it was a moment
[03:38:54] where I was like I knew I had like I had like finally like face that thing down which was like playing
[03:38:59] in the back of my head it was really weird when I would get into water situations or be in
[03:39:04] drowning which happened a lot like in free dive spear fishing you know and so I never had another
[03:39:11] another other issue again so it was a it was a moment of my life and I will never forget as long
[03:39:18] as I live we go offline I'll tell you somewhere details and then what what are you going on right now
[03:39:25] like with the the beef the ranch the cows like you're full on just going for it yeah I mean
[03:39:32] I just I mean my goal is so we just purchased this ranch we got a capital campaign going on
[03:39:38] and we've raised some money building a human development center there so which will be it's a 10
[03:39:43] person coal plunge a 10 person sauna a jam in the center and then a meditation room that's sound
[03:39:50] proof and then it vibrates at 520 it made the megahertz of the earth so it's very good grounding
[03:39:57] and when something's vibrating 525 megahertz do you hear it you feel it or it's not it's the earth
[03:40:04] so like if you ever if you know I always tell people like if you're having like anxiety or something
[03:40:09] like that like or you're just like you know sometimes you get that kind of like raciness or you
[03:40:13] feel like you got to like down regulate a little bit like the best thing you can go out is go outside
[03:40:17] take your shoes off stand in the ground being total silence and stand there and it usually goes away
[03:40:22] from like three to four minutes and I just breathe it's very grounding it it's very it grounds you
[03:40:28] and so you know frequencies are super important so we actually do sound with the guys and
[03:40:32] last of the guy said it was our first year doing it almost every guy said it was the most
[03:40:37] profound experience of their life we have somebody that comes in and brings those sound bowls
[03:40:42] and they bring up the resonance outside on the ranch like deep where the sweat lodges and it just
[03:40:47] vibrates it and they do these bowls and it's like whoa so some people it's so intense they vomit
[03:40:53] from it so wait you sit you lay there and these are big bowls I don't know what you're talking
[03:40:58] about yeah they're bowls and they stir them and they put the each bowl produces a frequency and
[03:41:03] they can bring you up to the resonance which ground it grounds you and so you know obviously like
[03:41:09] everything is frequency and everything is is like how are you looking at somebody on their iPhone
[03:41:15] they're like how am I talking to you how am I vibrating right now and you are somehow interpreting
[03:41:19] what I'm saying to your brain I'm literally vibrating to you and somehow you're like yeah
[03:41:25] let's go do something right go over here like and so you know that's that's that sound therapy
[03:41:32] is something that it works it's very very powerful if you've you've never tried it there's
[03:41:37] probably places here go go to a sound bath they have all these bowls all these things they'll
[03:41:41] bring you in there and because your whole life is inundated with blue light and frequencies and
[03:41:46] what Wi-Fi signals and all those kind of things so what you're doing is you're reestablishing a baseline
[03:41:51] so so yeah so the ranch we're building the human development center we got an arena going up
[03:41:56] 100 by 200 indoor arena so we can expand kind of into the winter time and then the guys live in
[03:42:02] non-electric wood cabins without door showers and an outhouse total minimalist so
[03:42:09] brings in the guys the students the students are going through yeah are going through so they
[03:42:13] do live in like little lodgepole cabins that were building that are just little bunks a little wood
[03:42:18] stove and an outdoor shower and an outhouse a double outhouse good get some about yeah get some yeah
[03:42:25] I'm our fact this year when we put the double outhouse that we forgot to put the little blanket in the
[03:42:29] center three days later the guys like hey do you know like a blanket or something I was like
[03:42:33] I'm sorry I totally forgot about that but they were using it yeah which is the survey that's one
[03:42:38] of those things that's one of the like starkest memories I have from navy blue camp was that there's
[03:42:44] no stalls in the shitters and you were just literally sitting down and there was someone sitting next to
[03:42:48] you you know a photo away taking a shit next to you it's just the removal of whatever it's kind
[03:42:55] of the removal of all privacy is gone yeah it's gone yeah it's got a hundred percent yeah
[03:43:00] poop next to you that's how much we only move in that whole next to that other dude
[03:43:06] different than before and by the way there's another dude on the other side of you that's also
[03:43:10] shitty so that's good times so you're so you're building this so this is gonna up our capacity
[03:43:16] to take more students do more yeah because right now I mean the guys are living in wall tents
[03:43:21] and everything's out all the outdoor showers all that kind of stuff the ranch we bought has
[03:43:24] basically a tiny little cabin on it that you know Abraham Lincoln's contractor bill and two
[03:43:30] pivot you know and and a small shop that had no well or anything so we popped in a well we've done
[03:43:36] all this stuff and so now we're raising money to to build that out and to expand the program
[03:43:40] to year round and you know my goal is not to have some big giant program like I think that is
[03:43:46] the problem is that everybody thinks there's like one institution that can do it all and
[03:43:52] my idea is to kind of get to a sweet spot with guys and then you know we're capturing data
[03:43:58] and then to go and to get other organizations to uplevel themselves and to begin to really
[03:44:03] start thinking about like human development and bringing forth change rather than like me saying
[03:44:08] like I can do it all and I can build this huge thing and I want to I want to network with people
[03:44:13] and have them scale up and that people that are really serious about human development and I think
[03:44:17] that will I think we'll look back in this will be a hub of you know it'll be a place where
[03:44:24] a spark formed and when people start looking at things different because the guys that graduate
[03:44:28] this program you know it's a they're they're they're they're different they're changed you know what I mean
[03:44:37] and and so I think that everybody deserves that opportunity but I can't do it all and I think that
[03:44:43] other people like I said there's 50,000 nonprofits in North America you know we spent 92 billion
[03:44:48] dollars since 2012 in the end of 2020 and it's gotten worse you know and I'm sorry and a lot of people
[03:44:56] like you know I hate me because I say you know you got organizations they got shatlin ponies
[03:45:02] that you can take and they put sneakers on them and you walk around town like my message is
[03:45:10] you know fuck you like that is that does it that does it do anything like it takes time and it
[03:45:16] takes commitment and maybe that's not for everybody and you'll have to walk your own path but I think
[03:45:21] that as all these existing institutions maybe I can find 10 maybe I can find 10 that are
[03:45:26] focused on human development maybe maybe it's saying like hey think about the change of a guy you
[03:45:31] take a guy's 75 pounds over ways on meds he's like but he wants to change and he's got the fire and
[03:45:36] you put him in a 10 week fight camp right and then think about who that guy would be at the end of
[03:45:41] 10 weeks right nutrition diet focus meditation ice bass like working out purpose like feeling
[03:45:47] good it's you're all like getting balance all those things like I mean it's it's simple
[03:45:53] but it's it's it takes effort and it takes work and so my my goal is to is to start a new conversation
[03:46:02] and bring people together about what it you know about restoring you know these guys back to the
[03:46:09] dignity of who they are it's crazy like the shit's not gonna be easy if you're gonna reset your life
[03:46:17] and dig in and find out who you are that's not gonna that's not gonna be an easy evolution
[03:46:24] no don't it's like yeah it's like yeah and it's crazy you know that that opening that
[03:46:29] read for me was like literally there are some people that are literally trying to give you a magic
[03:46:35] pill that's gonna do all this work for you like which is a crazy thing it's crazy it's insane
[03:46:42] like when you think about it but the thing is we already know the secrets of it right that's why
[03:46:47] you know the business people are like hmm let's create something called obstacle course races
[03:46:51] right like you literally climb over a log flop into the mud then some roi did out dude
[03:46:56] hit to ahead with a phone bat and then you get like a metal and then the next day in the office
[03:47:00] everyone's like whoa what's dipping about him he faced an obstacle gym and he overcame right
[03:47:08] I mean that is the asset obstacle course races like I mean we so so set that challenge in front of
[03:47:15] yourself I think we can like unite together dude different for me like I never thought you know
[03:47:20] we bought a ranch for three million bucks I met this guy he was delivering hey I started talking
[03:47:27] to me he goes oh my dad might be selling his ranch you should meet him are you looking for
[03:47:30] a ranch I'm like sure yeah definitely we worked we were seven years with no ranch
[03:47:34] at least everything set it up every year mobile gypsy camp it was a living hell imagine 70 horses
[03:47:40] not owning 16th of an acre was a nightmare and most people never saw that and so here I am like
[03:47:47] going to this guy's place I sit down a cup of coffee you know big business guy I sit down I'm like
[03:47:52] he's like so he interested in the ranch like yeah he's like well to have any money I'm like no
[03:47:57] no thanks for coming like basically it was like really nice but then never talked to me again
[03:48:04] so then like a year later he calls me up he's like I'm definitely gonna sell the ranch
[03:48:07] are you interested and I was like absolutely so I ride down there my mortar cycle and I'm like
[03:48:11] I sit down with him he pours me a cup of coffee goes do you have any money and I'm like
[03:48:17] no but I'm gonna get it because it was like it was like the jerk store with like you know
[03:48:22] with George just adds it I was like thought of this this come back like the whole year and he's like
[03:48:28] well I said I'll give you my word give me an opportunity and I'll get it and I didn't have any
[03:48:36] of that kind of resources so ended up getting alone what was that that was last year so you
[03:48:40] got the wrong against a charity yeah we got loan yeah we got loan on the ranch and so
[03:48:46] and I raised a million five from various donors and put that you know down payment whenever took a
[03:48:51] loan out and you know and we just launched a four year capital campaign to build a ranch out so
[03:48:56] some 7.5 million bucks over four years and and then you know the funny thing is about non-profits
[03:49:02] is that at own it I'm basically even though I'm the founder I'm just an employee I'll never have
[03:49:08] those assets like if the whole thing dissolved tomorrow goes to either the state or to another
[03:49:11] nonprofit and so you know I exist in this solely for the development and betterment of my fellow
[03:49:19] man and I think that you know whether it's a veteran or it's a stay-at-home or somebody recovering
[03:49:26] from a get ran over by a dumb truck or whatever it is I think that people are gonna once again
[03:49:32] begin looking to to partake in that heroes journey and that journey of self-discovery to get out of the
[03:49:39] places that they're currently in and so that's that's my goal and we're capturing data we're
[03:49:45] working with the university to get results and stuff like that so that I can go to other non-profits
[03:49:49] and sit down with that person say listen I know you give $5,000 to critically injured soldiers
[03:49:55] I also know that you have $290 million in the bank because your financials are public and online
[03:50:00] as a nonprofit maybe you could run a program that actually does something for people beyond
[03:50:08] getting on their kids' iPads maybe we can do something to a better mankind you know maybe we can do
[03:50:13] something to level up you know society our society our community in a way and and stop giving
[03:50:21] handouts and start you know giving hand-ups you know I think that handouts are a total failure I think
[03:50:30] yeah of course people have things and stuff like that you know critical things but like for the most
[03:50:34] part like you have to own it you have to earn it and you have to own it and I think we get in the
[03:50:40] opportunity business and we get out of the handout business oh you served come on and float into
[03:50:46] tube and we have a massage therapist online thank you for your Air Force time oh here's a
[03:50:51] flame and yon and a care and a raspberry like you know then a jacket and some fishing here even
[03:50:58] though you live in Detroit and you live in one bedroom apartment and you live below the poverty line
[03:51:02] like most veterans do and and maybe I'm going to give you an opportunity to change your own life
[03:51:08] but you're going to have to do the work and we get back in the opportunity business that's
[03:51:14] what I want to see happen and then hopefully you know you know in the meteorite hits the world
[03:51:20] and dinosaurs come back or everything like that it'll be like a plaque somewhere and I was like
[03:51:24] he tried to do good but it was futile they destroyed themselves aren't you aren't you trying to
[03:51:32] do something with with beef too like yeah so we're going with that yeah so so the beef model is kind
[03:51:39] of like so I I talked about the social hybrid is this nonprofits are in this perpetual
[03:51:45] starvation cycle right where you're beholden to the donors where you know you have to raise money
[03:51:50] and then you know you're constantly in this state of having to raise money because you can't
[03:51:53] generate money because you're a non-profit I didn't know that by the name when I started
[03:51:57] like why am I so broke and then like five years later I'm like wait a second non-profit
[03:52:04] and damn it so but I was like we have this ranch you know we're going to start a cattle company
[03:52:13] farm to table you know and I think that like the care of the animal from the moment it's born
[03:52:18] living and dying on the ranch treating the animal with respect you know if you've ever been
[03:52:23] to mass agriculture and you saw what it's really about it's one of the most disturbing things
[03:52:28] that you've ever seen in your life and if you've ever been to a slaughterhouse or packing plan
[03:52:31] where they're doing a thousand head a day you know they're picking them up with skid stairs and
[03:52:35] terrified adrenaline hormones like smat ages very it's not good and I think that I think that
[03:52:45] carries over to the food and so like you know raising that animal honoring that animal letting
[03:52:49] them graze letting them live letting them be out there letting them live their lives sustainably
[03:52:53] harvesting them teaching people how to do that you know integrating that and then selling that beef
[03:52:58] to donors that can then in turn support the program so the ranch stands on its own to legs so
[03:53:04] it's a social high bread it won't exist to make money but it will exist to sustain you know the
[03:53:09] program then also expose people to that animal husbandry into that ranching side of the house and then
[03:53:14] also you know down along with the beef I I think like to me food like where your food comes from
[03:53:21] is so important and it's so critical to the wellness of the individual you can expect to be happy if you're
[03:53:26] eating you know cheeses and garbage and all those kind it all is tied together your body is the
[03:53:33] subconscious mind and even down to the food that you eat and you know what I started getting exposed
[03:53:39] to this world and I started seeing things I was like man this is like rough like when you really
[03:53:44] see what's happening put to the animals and those kind of things and listen I'm not like you know
[03:53:48] out there like you know whatever like an activist or anything like that but I'm like there's a
[03:53:53] better way like the natives did it right you know they they harvested they took what they wanted
[03:53:58] they they used every component of the you know think about the waste that we have the only
[03:54:02] take the best cuts everything's dog food or this or that like and so for me it's like but
[03:54:06] you're in the whole animal using the bones to create bone broth taking the hides and making
[03:54:11] boxing gloves and and American made boxing gloves with the hides and like taking all the fat
[03:54:16] taking all those things taking the bones making biochar out of them right so like using that as a
[03:54:22] organic fertilizer that we could use on the ranch and we could give away and share with other
[03:54:26] people like using the whole animal and teaching guys those things because when they become connected
[03:54:31] to their food they start to understand the system that they're a part of you know I tell people
[03:54:37] the whole world is like your life is held together by a wire okay a wire so like if the wire breaks
[03:54:45] meaning like the power goes out millions will die within weeks from a wire like oh I'll hunt you're
[03:54:53] not gonna hunt you're not gonna make it out of your high rise you're gonna like you'll be in a
[03:54:58] 25 million dollar tomb okay the water comes out what are you gonna do it's over a cable a cable
[03:55:06] breaks the internet goes out and millions die and I think that so many guys like common they
[03:55:12] realize and they change their whole lives because they start to realize the role that we pay in the
[03:55:16] system and how you know how everything is now handed to you and you take for granted all those
[03:55:23] aspects and so my goal is to stand up that that system and that human development program and then
[03:55:30] begin to get other people to do the same thing and I want to expand a community you know and
[03:55:35] that's my goal so that's what's going on with the beef and just I mean I talk a lot well and not a lot
[03:55:42] I talk about China China yeah China and you know we saw a lot of this during COVID
[03:55:49] like where do we depend and on but we're dependent on China food and a lot of people don't
[03:55:55] recognize that China let me China China is coming for us I tell people I'm like if you look at
[03:56:04] Mao during the Chinese industrial revolution the Great Leap Forward Mao knew that he needed
[03:56:10] nuclear technology there's been five emperors in China emperors you want that's what I'll call
[03:56:15] dictators whatever leaders great ones whatever dragonlords so like microcrash and so
[03:56:24] but if you look at what they did he understood that they needed nuclear technology so what do
[03:56:29] do he traded food to the Russians and exchange for nuclear technology star-dismone people 30
[03:56:35] million people died during peacetime and he got the nuclear weapon they have a 5,000 year plan
[03:56:42] all right they understand that by by enslaving their own people for cheap labor because Americans
[03:56:49] exist for consumption I want it now and I want to cheap and you know it's like my house I go in there
[03:56:57] how many how much shit do I need right it's cheap it's only three bucks another potato dealer
[03:57:04] you never know so so so so chop me potato peelers did you actually have five I did have five
[03:57:11] so I did have I kept two shout out to queez and art but I I was like if you look at them they're
[03:57:18] smart because what they did is they understood the American psychology they understand that Americans
[03:57:23] are overconfident because from childhood they're told you're the best you're good you get praise
[03:57:29] for things you never deserved they're entitled and lazy Chinese are the opposite right
[03:57:35] so they're like marching forward to their 5,000 year destiny and so what are we do we outsource
[03:57:42] everything to them for super cheap goods and in turn handcuff ourselves to them right including our
[03:57:49] medications the world's most critical medications are men trying and so you know China is on the move
[03:57:55] and their military is now expeditionary they're providing aid to foreign countries they've
[03:57:59] got their jets and let me they got hypersonic missiles and let me tell you something they're not
[03:58:04] over here like trying to pass the PT test okay oh didn't you know gotta go to FAP because I didn't
[03:58:11] make it by the way my rights matter you don't tow the line in the Chinese army you wind up as
[03:58:17] biochar okay they don't know need for you and and GZing Ping said that you know if we try to
[03:58:24] stand against the China this is two months ago and a live speech he said on their show of force
[03:58:27] and he said you will meet a great wall of steel made by 1.8 billion Chinese that are unified
[03:58:35] what are we over here like don't go over here like I don't like you like so they banned all
[03:58:41] girly men on TV there is no boy bands allowed social media turns off at 10 o'clock at night
[03:58:48] and and what are they preparing for to be a world leader and who are they in lock
[03:58:54] stuff with the Russians right and and because they see the United States to wind the link
[03:58:59] because consumption consumerism entitlement over confidence and and and this desire to tell
[03:59:07] people what's right and wrong you know like we have these things on the what happened in Afghanistan
[03:59:13] right we're no longer a force for good we aren't we better rethink because this enemy is not like
[03:59:19] an Afghani running around in pajamas these dudes are probably genetically modified who knows what
[03:59:25] they're gonna do they might unzip their fake Chinese bodies and come out and just be like who knows
[03:59:30] right we they are genetically modifying super soldiers for just that or was it a time or whatever
[03:59:35] just had a thing on them so we are facing a time right now where this entitlement and all these
[03:59:42] things that we have are coming home to roost on us and you know buyer beware because if the cable
[03:59:49] breaks if the earth even burps okay if it just rumbles in the wrong place and the power goes out
[03:59:56] for say two months millions upon there won't be enough excavators to dig the holes for the bodies
[04:00:04] that will burn people because oh no but it's the truth think about it if you're living in a 25
[04:00:13] million dollar high rise on the 98th floor and the power goes out where do you get your next sandwich
[04:00:21] from by time you make it down every store will be gone now the food will be gone there will be
[04:00:26] no water your well pumps won't just think about it life is held together by a cable and we never
[04:00:33] think that that cable is going to ever break and you know who's holding part of that cable
[04:00:38] network is China and I don't think that China would have picked a fight with us but I think we've
[04:00:44] picked a fight with them and because here we are just bloating bloating bloating bloating bloating
[04:00:50] and and and they're refining refining refining refining refining so I mean if if put in a
[04:00:58] vase you crane I bet you I bet you you see China China go after Taiwan simultaneously I wouldn't be
[04:01:04] surprised and and they could launch hypersonic missiles and vaporize our fleet in two seconds and then
[04:01:09] it's either go nuclear or stand down I think I don't know what's what's today just for reference
[04:01:16] today is the 24th of January nice I think that bootens going in I think you crints I think it's on
[04:01:24] and I think it's what he's doing he's looking at Biden who's compromised and he is
[04:01:32] it breaks it breaks my heart and Russia is a bonepic because think about it we Eisenhower screwed them
[04:01:37] over because we're supposed to pay them all that money and we never did and then we chased them over to
[04:01:43] right over to Afghanistan you know cause problems over there walked on them over there did the
[04:01:48] cold war ripped the walls down with crushed her economy did all these things right and now we're telling
[04:01:54] them oh you can't go across those borders and they're just like meanwhile the Russians are over there
[04:02:00] like every guy is like kabib yeah there's a like kill kill kill kill kill how guys are over here like
[04:02:07] stand down people are being mean we're they're gonna call us back oh yeah not all Americans are
[04:02:14] like that there's definitely too many of that I mean there's definitely plenty of Americans I
[04:02:18] were I work with a lot of young military folks and man they are yeah there's kids ready to rock and roll
[04:02:24] but I don't know if the country is I'm if the country's willing to sacrifice like in those
[04:02:29] situations our guts are ripped out I mean think about 20 year war you think you think about like the
[04:02:35] United States there was a USA article last year it's it's worth checking out even though they're kind of
[04:02:40] like whatever but like they have a article with a moving map on it called the cost of war
[04:02:47] if you go if you look it up or Dr. Gore whatever brave it and you will see a moving map and it
[04:02:53] shows last year the United States you know wedged war in 88 countries okay so we we had we had an 88
[04:03:01] so we're getting look at the British Empire they got so spread so thin and so many places
[04:03:06] right and they got so worn down there face and conflicts in Turkey and the conflicts in India and
[04:03:11] conflict next thing you know America you got George Washington's like gonna kill you right and
[04:03:17] and so America's become super extended and I think we need to restore what it means to be an American
[04:03:24] like I think we've lost I think that term is synonymous with the wrong things and and being a
[04:03:30] patriotists synonymous with the wrong things you think patriotic like dude riding a jacked upside
[04:03:35] by side like woo like oh like freedom like no there is no freedom there's only free and that's
[04:03:43] what America freedom means that someone's affording me that to me free is an alienable right
[04:03:48] is is to live like as I see fit and fulfill my purpose and this nation affords me that and
[04:03:55] in turn I serve you know my country that gives me the opportunity and provides all this
[04:03:59] infrastructure and all those kinds of things we take all that for granted and we need to restore
[04:04:02] the message of what it means to be an American I don't care what political parties and
[04:04:07] what color and your race and gender I don't care about any of those things what it is is a common
[04:04:12] thread that made this nation incredibly great and we've taken it for granted and it's starting to get
[04:04:16] afraid and what happens is is that it's like Lenin said you give them a rope and let them
[04:04:24] pull it around their neck and they'll hang in themselves matter fact they sold us the rope
[04:04:29] and we put it around our necks and so I hope I hope we can change I hope the noise can
[04:04:34] quiet down because if people got serious just you change the world by changing yourself that's
[04:04:40] the thing there's not these big grandiose ideas where I get out there and I'm like have the
[04:04:44] huge idea the idea is that I'm the really macro scale I change myself and when I change myself I
[04:04:51] change the things around me and when the people around me change themselves the things around me change
[04:04:56] and that's how mass change happens it happens inversely as well and so you know change for the
[04:05:04] negative and I think like to restore what it means to be American to be able to walk down the street
[04:05:09] and be able to grab somebody about a hand to be united to to restore it kind of that that viewpoint
[04:05:16] of what's made us so great is is the is is the common thread that runs through the hearts of
[04:05:23] every single one of us and and we have to put all those things aside all these projections aside
[04:05:30] and get back to the basics of what it means to be a human and I think that we can come back from this
[04:05:36] do I think we will I don't know um I don't know but if we don't um it will happen to us
[04:05:48] and uh and it will be more swift and more violent it would could ever imagine whether it comes
[04:05:54] from the planet or whether it comes from another nation um the time to change is now is right now
[04:06:01] and and and to readjust so yeah and like you just said all that starts with you yeah
[04:06:11] whoever you are you if you're listening to this right now it's you change and don't be afraid to
[04:06:18] change you know we're so attached to these outcomes like don't be afraid to change and uh um yeah
[04:06:25] I just like I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I see it in the world and I see people like I like today on the
[04:06:32] bus I saw these people and like man we are so disconnected from each shot just trying to walk
[04:06:39] out the door of the bus to the rental car company people are shoving each other just to get out first
[04:06:47] so they could do what the one step in front of the other guy right like that's not who we are as a
[04:06:55] nation that's what makes us different and we got to get we got to get back to those cores core values
[04:07:02] all right this is a long one that's all good man um I want to make sure so you've been mentioning
[04:07:08] your your nonprofit yeah uh horses and heroes heroes and horses but I get it backwards
[04:07:15] it's heroes and horses yeah heroes and horses you go to heroes and horses dot org is in there
[04:07:23] you also have Instagram and Facebook and YouTube channel heroes and horses all of those can be found at the same spot
[04:07:33] echo you got anything I do actually keep so long time ago few hours ago you mentioned something
[04:07:39] about an experience with a black bear and then you just sort of moved on day point I wanted to come back
[04:07:46] I don't want to know what what happened with the black bear let's see where it looks looking
[04:07:50] like you around you right now look you know you know it's really funny about that I've had so many
[04:07:55] runins with bears at this point in the game I look back at that one and it's kind of makes me
[04:08:01] chuckle I mean I've had we had a bear come out horse go off a cliff and get him pale like I mean
[04:08:07] I run into him archery hunting all the time and and now I'm like my black bear story when I was like a
[04:08:13] teenager coming back from my dark years and this black bear like 10th is kind of like if I see a black bear
[04:08:19] literally the back of the jump I'm just like I just pick a stick up I'm like god he's like I like take off
[04:08:23] a grizzly bear is different a grizzly bear is like you feel like you're hunted but
[04:08:28] yeah no what had happened was I was out hiking um I was kind of just like you know here I am
[04:08:33] returning from you know this kind of childhood you know I guess you could say productle son kind of
[04:08:39] experience and I'm up there hiking and a grizzly bear while I'm sleeping out no 10 small black
[04:08:45] bear kind of comes in and he's like literally sniffing around he's all by me and everything and
[04:08:50] I also had was like a Swiss army knife that I'm gotten from my grandfather you'd have the
[04:08:54] kind with a little white toothpick you could pull out and and I have never had it and and I was
[04:09:01] actually very terrified at the time I was like oh my god like here's this thing I'm laying in my sleeping
[04:09:06] bag and he's just kind of sniffing around sniffing around he's walking around and that's what really
[04:09:11] like I started thinking about my life he got my food I didn't have it wrapped up probably it's my food
[04:09:15] and so anyway that experience right there like when I came back I finished my hike with no food
[04:09:22] it was like a three day hike so two nights and three days total and that was on my first night
[04:09:28] and that whole time I reflected on what I want my life to be and so that was a real pivotal moment
[04:09:33] in my life that that little pack bear came in and it made me think about the fragility of my own life
[04:09:40] you know and I'll tell you like there's nothing more that feeling in the wilderness of
[04:09:48] the wilderness is no mercy you know it has only rule and only law it has no mercy that there is no
[04:09:55] quality in nature you know and you feel that when you're around animals and you see them and you're
[04:10:00] with them there's a there's an honesty that happens you know and I discovered that honesty really for
[04:10:07] because I was a lost person you know and I I did feel like I was invincible and so that little
[04:10:12] back bear kind of brought it in made me when my Swiss army knife and maybe feel my own fragility so
[04:10:16] that's what kind of led me to take in the next step to change well I'm gonna ask you I'm just gonna
[04:10:22] ask so what happened with the gris the horse fall off the cliff so I mean I mean I think I
[04:10:27] can ask you now we're gonna stop recording I'm gonna ask you as soon as we get done so you
[04:10:30] know as I tell everybody know as ever it's gonna happen yeah so I was like you know
[04:10:34] it's like my second season packing and you know I got a pack string with me and I'm in the
[04:10:40] back and a grizzly bear kind of comes out on the trail it comes kind of like barreling down
[04:10:44] most of the time the bears will stop kind of like look sometimes they'll stand up and then
[04:10:49] they usually when they see the horses they don't like the horses when you're alone by yourself that
[04:10:53] is a completely different story and one of the guys one of the cowboys was in front of me and he
[04:11:01] thought he was kind of kind of spooked the bear off more which was still kind of going down the trail
[04:11:06] because he dropped down to the next switchback and when he did the the horse spooked when the bear
[04:11:12] moved and he went off the side it was very steep and the horse kind of locked up as hindquarters
[04:11:17] and then took a jump locked up as hindquarters and then there was like one huge like Douglas fur
[04:11:23] with a giant timber or bow sticking out that was like pointed and when the horse leaped you know
[04:11:29] at that kind of steep grade it gained a lot of altitude and it landed directly onto that thing
[04:11:36] and I went through it stomach and out it's side and it made the most horrible noise I've ever heard
[04:11:42] a horse make in my life and it was like like and it was like making this bellowing sound that the
[04:11:49] cowboy flips off peels the head stall off the horse everyone's like screaming like am I gonna
[04:11:55] so I'm like jump off my horse I just leave the mule's loose and I start like kind of trying to get
[04:12:01] down on and the horse is like kicking and blood is like pumping out it's hitting me my face I mean
[04:12:06] it's a large animal and I'm trying to get him up off this thing and the cowboy is kind of
[04:12:12] the heads dazed and he's like there's like I need help getting this horse up we're trying to stop
[04:12:16] the bleeding like and I'm like and then the horse died died like probably like within 10 seconds
[04:12:21] blood out I'm as massive injury and uh where was nothing more healing than that uh yeah so I you know
[04:12:31] that was uh that was an intense experience I've had them um we had some guys we had a guy quit
[04:12:38] three years ago bear came out barreled towards the whole pack string
[04:12:45] the guy that was working for me at the time shot him and tumble them bear turned came out of
[04:12:51] again hit him a second time what was he shooting what was he 57 that's why I carry 44 mag
[04:12:56] and it was a guy who had to attend them more shots and like 44 mag and they're so the bear
[04:13:05] tumbles and of course you got to call the forest service and since like investigation and they
[04:13:09] came up and it was 13 feet uh the shot was made 13 feet the bear print from the horse I use
[04:13:15] about to use about the tackle the animal but most of the times you know they don't really want
[04:13:21] to bother you but you know you never know and the guy that quit was like yeah and I'm good well the
[04:13:26] whole pack string exploded okay so if we hear comes at grizzly bear a dead run and next thing
[04:13:31] you know these guys are five you know they're on day nine on horses their horses start
[04:13:36] bucking and you blow up and the meals are going ever I mean it's like a yard itself this is
[04:13:41] complete freaking mayhem mayhem mayhem mayhem you because like I mean somebody that was more
[04:13:46] skill could have like got a hold of them if you watch that film the 500 mile project
[04:13:50] you know it's it's a great film but we had a guy a mountain bike run into them and the horse
[04:13:59] rid back and broke his orbitals broke his face and and then half of it meant a factor whatever
[04:14:03] but things can get sideways you know with horses like pretty quick and that grizzly bear
[04:14:08] experience was was one of those but doesn't happen often and you know so by the way applied
[04:14:14] to the program totally safe almost totally well well protect you know but it's it's a huge
[04:14:21] opportunity we just opened applications by the way I'll plug that real quick last week so
[04:14:27] they're piling up quick and you know we'll close them I think March 31st and then April 1st
[04:14:33] we select the class so we're kind of select them along the way and that selection is eight people
[04:14:38] yeah or is it six or three eight man classes and then we'll run everyone across the wall 32 guys go through
[04:14:44] the program this year so yeah so so applications are open nine so go to heroes and horses.org and
[04:14:51] but apply if you're interested in coming out for the experience of your lifetime right on
[04:14:55] and so 357 mag no no good for for bear no it's not I mean I have a 44 mag I'll tell you right now
[04:15:02] I've like I've done so many side cuts by side comparisons with guns like 10 mills 357s I'm telling
[04:15:11] you you want that initial knock down power to be a wake up call and let me tell you when
[04:15:15] a bear runs they put their head down load of the ground they're not like up there's super
[04:15:22] load of the ground and so you know a lot of people don't realize that like they're actually
[04:15:26] difficult to hit because they're like when they're running at you like that you know 30 miles
[04:15:31] an hour they're coming at there's a lot happening very quickly and bears aren't as scared of people
[04:15:36] anymore the scariest thing is when I shoot you know when I knock an elk down and I'm by myself
[04:15:42] and then I got you know hit on the GPS for the guys that read the horses or whatever and I'm out
[04:15:46] there by myself like stand over gut pile that is like the worst feeling. Chum in the water man
[04:15:51] it's the worst feeling like you want to you know I always build a fire and I like make it like
[04:15:56] super big or whatever and I try to put pine bows over and piss on I'm gonna do all these like the
[04:16:00] kind of things or whatever but you want to talk about like getting in your you know I'm doing
[04:16:04] the whole like what's that I'm the only one out there my god there's not like come on to take
[04:16:09] that horses to get to you depends where I'm at you know some long-awaited okay
[04:16:13] you ever slept out on some guts no no no guys come no matter what you're forced to see at night
[04:16:20] I always felt listen we ride at night and it's for I mean things happen I mean there is no
[04:16:25] this what it is you're at a night you want to find out you know he's tell people I said you don't know you know
[04:16:30] a lot of people don't know this a little bit of history but I always tell them that the uh
[04:16:34] maybe I shouldn't say this but the an old cowboy told me one time that the cathode religion was
[04:16:40] actually started in Montana and it was uh it was an old outfit or looking for a tree branches at night
[04:16:45] right so riding the source and I always told that joke to the guys joking around shout out to the
[04:16:50] folks whatever but I I it works like if you ride you can't see anything and you're like
[04:16:58] you know it is the craziest feeling to ride all through the night on a horse it's wild but the horse
[04:17:03] is no what's up oh they see perfect right no but you can't see anything you know and you're
[04:17:08] walking on these like ridges and you just hear like rocks like ding ding ding ding ding
[04:17:12] you're like ah okay you just like you really ride an horse name like ding batter at every like
[04:17:16] I don't know I trust you but they don't want to die either so yeah here is an horse is that or
[04:17:22] I really appreciate the opportunity uh and taking the time you know to kind of hear the story and stuff
[04:17:27] so thank you very much well hey man thanks for coming on you know sharing these lessons
[04:17:33] thanks for your service and in everything that you did and and really man I think thanks for the
[04:17:39] most part what you're doing right now man I think it's awesome and um appreciate it bro all right
[04:17:45] thanks thanks Echo Mikeo just stepped stepped out awesome having him on I just was reviewing my
[04:17:54] notes that I was taking while he was talking and most of them I got to but there's one that I
[04:18:01] didn't get to address and I'm sure maybe come back on at some point we can talk about her we'll
[04:18:05] just talk about it but you remember he told the story or he was he was making hypothetical
[04:18:10] situation Warren Buffett is in the desert he has no water and Micah Sees him and Micah has water
[04:18:20] and Warren Buffett's gonna die and he says you know I'll give you this water but you have to give me
[04:18:26] all of your money and and and Micah says so he's gonna do it right and that's true
[04:18:35] often but here's the crazy thing there are people whose ego will not allow them to make that trade
[04:18:48] they would actually rather die I know that sounds crazy sounds a little bit inconceivable let me
[04:18:54] tell you how it's not inconceivable in what LaFroat about with the with the situation with a
[04:19:03] a special operations unit that was gonna conduct an operation and LaF talk to some
[04:19:12] national guard guys that were saying do not do that operation LaF goes and gives that information
[04:19:18] to the special operations unit that was gonna go do it and those guys were like no we're going
[04:19:25] the national guard guard guys they don't know how to handle it I forget with the exact
[04:19:30] warning but we don't need to listen to them instead we're gonna go do this mission and so we have
[04:19:36] to keep in mind that ego is so strong that if you have a guy now look Warren Buffett might be a guy
[04:19:43] who's you know let us eat these older guy maybe he's got enough life experiences to be like oh
[04:19:48] I want to live that's more important to me but I guarantee there are some individuals that would
[04:19:53] rather die than admit that they're wrong they'd rather die than take help from someone else
[04:19:59] they'd rather die than ask for help so that was just one little thing that I thought about as
[04:20:09] and unfortunately you know I took the note and then I didn't get to get to bring it up with
[04:20:14] with Micah but that is something to think about you don't realize how powerful
[04:20:20] a negative force an ego can be yeah I was thinking the same thing to at that time there's a movie
[04:20:30] like kind of new I think where it had Kevin Spacey in it and then before they released it they replaced
[04:20:35] them because there was Kevin Spacey scandal you know I'm gonna be talking about something about the
[04:20:41] don't want to say the cats beer I don't know I don't know what movie but it was basically
[04:20:45] the famous rich guy when is in the movie or that's the movies about both okay both um it's
[04:20:52] I don't know yeah so it's about a real it's like kind of like a true story or something I think
[04:20:56] if I'm mistaken I'm only getting like piece of it but it's basically about uh this super duper rich guy
[04:21:03] they I want to say they kidnapped his son or something like that the daughter or something
[04:21:09] and they're like hey basically like you know held him for ransom or like give us this money or
[04:21:14] whatever and the guy and he was no money for this guy like he was not that much and he was in the
[04:21:20] I think it was like on the news or something it was like oh so what are you gonna do it was like I don't
[04:21:23] care I don't care like there's no way he would give money it was that it was like that no that much you know
[04:21:30] where yeah I can lose a son like whatever it's like the it's not like and I'm totally trying to
[04:21:37] remember the thing but it wasn't it wasn't like oh I kind of forward it or it wasn't it was
[04:21:41] more about the prince ride yeah yeah like like no no no no I can't get much money no I can do that
[04:21:46] to me kind of a thing like I'm never mean what like you know kind of really important thing you
[04:21:51] know the son or the grandson or something like that but yeah I thought that same thing to I said
[04:21:56] I get I get the example because true it is true it's basically like like saying without your
[04:22:01] health you have nothing you know like you can't you can't bring your mind to the grave like
[04:22:04] it's true true but there are these weird little exceptions where it's like that doesn't matter
[04:22:09] to some some people yeah that ego gets that ego starts to get charged up man it's um it can be
[04:22:15] it can definitely be a scary thing so it's like anybody even said this before where he goes essentially
[04:22:21] like a like a drug that you can you know some people like they'll they'll just take drugs till they die
[04:22:28] like you're gonna kill you that's an example yeah yeah exactly it's like that you know people
[04:22:32] those smoke cigarettes like so much it'll be like hey they think that I said was your ego will love
[04:22:37] you to death your ego will love you to death just like drugs will love you do like drugs love you
[04:22:44] yep and I took this from Jay I think if I remember correctly Jay Adams who is an old school
[04:22:51] skateboarder like dog town Z boys and I heard him saying drugs will love you to death
[04:23:00] because you know he had a bunch he had problems with addiction and went to jail and all the stuff and
[04:23:04] actually met him and kind of hung out with him little bit I was my friend my friend
[04:23:11] uh ran and underground skate downhill skate boarding uh event I like not just one but like
[04:23:21] a regular basis yeah and and it was like hey we're gonna meet at this random mountain that just
[04:23:27] got freshly paved the state just freshly paved some of them mountain and we're gonna meet out
[04:23:33] there and do downhill races have you ever been on a downhill skateboard uh I've been on a downhill
[04:23:38] skateboard yes okay I said oh I'll try what this is like or whatever I got on a downhill skateboard
[04:23:46] I went 20 feet and I was already going so fast I jumped off because I could see where this was going
[04:23:54] say it wasn't a good place I don't have the skill set to be doing this yeah guys race in levers
[04:23:59] like like a motorcycle racing letters they race in those things so I kind of so at any one of these
[04:24:06] underground events Jay Adams, REST and piece was there and you know I got to shake his hand and I
[04:24:13] didn't get a picture that's a bad move actually well how long ago was it 10 years? 10 years ago
[04:24:23] maybe 10 years oh maybe even a little bit longer ago you should have got a picture then
[04:24:27] pictures are available at that time because if it's like 1990 money oh no this was that this was
[04:24:32] recent this was like you know I was a grown man trying to get on a downhill skateboard
[04:24:37] those guys are freaking cool yes they are bombing hills yeah bombing hills you're on a
[04:24:44] scale this isn't on the snow or the water yeah like you fall on the snow look you can get
[04:24:48] her on snow for sure you can get her on the water you can notice there's a keyword there can
[04:24:53] you can get her on the water you can get her on the snow if you fall in a vegan downhill
[04:24:58] is it able to you're getting her now I the interestingly they don't they would let others they
[04:25:03] know how to fall better whatever yeah I think I think a lot of times especially in skateboarding in
[04:25:08] general that you just get hurt and I think those these guys are kind of just used to it where sure
[04:25:13] unless you break like your ankle you'd risk to whatever or whatever break whatever either hurt
[04:25:18] or you injured so skateboard is just used to get her it is basic well you get you get
[04:25:24] especially on the downhill right where you got to bail or whatever and you're sliding oh yes I mean
[04:25:27] oh you're what are you hitting someone's gonna stop you you know so Jay Adam said drugs will
[04:25:32] love you to death and as soon as I heard him say that I was yeah you know what also will love you
[04:25:36] to death your own ego your own ego will love you to death so you got to watch out for it you know
[04:25:43] yeah like the the short term payoff of what it delivers to you is just so makes you feel so good or safe
[04:25:49] or secure or whatever get that the later that like yeah I mean while you're your health safety
[04:25:55] well being got to be careful out well hey this has already been a really long podcast to
[04:26:00] appreciate everyone for listening if you want to support the podcast go to jockelfuel.com get some
[04:26:06] get some supplements of whatever kind you may need jockelfuel.com we also have look we talked
[04:26:14] a little bit about China today China we talked a little bit about China we are we are in an
[04:26:21] economic war with China for the time being could it escalate yes it could if we lose the economic
[04:26:27] war trust me the escalation is going to be real bad so we're in an economic war with China right
[04:26:32] now and at origin USA we are on the front lines of that war we are building stuff in America
[04:26:39] the things that Mike was talking about today you know a sense of purpose when you when you're
[04:26:45] not making anything you don't have let me refresh that when you are making something producing
[04:26:52] something building something you have a sense of purpose and when you're building something that's
[04:26:57] helping rebuild your community you haven't even greater sense of purpose so if you want to help us
[04:27:06] rebuild our communities help us rebuild our country help provide a sense of purpose
[04:27:12] to hundreds and one day thousands of hardworking Americans then check out origin USA.com get
[04:27:22] awesome stuff that's made in America yeah I think that that content kind of
[04:27:28] probably goes deeper than maybe we might think at a glance where you know all like you know
[04:27:33] as technology involves involves and all like all this other stuff or whatever you know basically it's
[04:27:38] just an it's an evolution of problems being solved so the smaller problems get solved solve just so
[04:27:43] you can take on bigger problems right and then we have innovation and you know all this
[04:27:49] invention like back in the day right you have these simple tools a stick or rock you know and you're
[04:27:54] making like you're spending five days making this one thing that literally you can buy at 70
[04:27:59] 11 nowadays like that kind of stuff but back then it's just how it worked it's like yeah
[04:28:04] but if you want to fire bro it's going to take a lot to make that fire then after you make that
[04:28:08] fire it provides the warmth and the heat and you can cook for you and your family and all this stuff
[04:28:13] so it's like this little system that kind of works together but then when you start inventing
[04:28:19] things that fire part making the fire part becomes really inconvenient like we got to focus on this
[04:28:23] bigger problem here that making that fire takes like freaking I don't know 35 45 minutes that
[04:28:29] maybe would help us in this bigger problem if we could just do that in an instance so let's solve
[04:28:34] that problem in deaf or in in an indefinite level you know so boom we saw that problem now you
[04:28:39] got lighter as matches whatever right I'm sure it didn't happen in that order but I'm just saying for
[04:28:43] example but it just keeps going and going and going and going so we got a bunch of problem solved for us now
[04:28:49] yes all kinds of problems yes but now the problems because you know what's that hierarchy it's like
[04:28:54] had some hierarchy right hierarchy needs so now technology kind of like exploded so fast so now
[04:29:01] it ended us up on that that higher part of the hierarchy or the needs right but technology has it
[04:29:08] right now it's not good enough to solve those problems so now you got people
[04:29:12] depressed or whatever same same so now yeah if you we can infuse little sent sprinkles a
[04:29:20] sense of purpose into all of our lives really I think that's going to be the beginning of the
[04:29:25] the solution for our problem awakening yeah but it was just kind of like how micrussain where
[04:29:30] you kind of got to go down to the the baseline a little bit to explore like where can I infuse
[04:29:36] some of the purpose in that baseline then your life it just says the whole will be more
[04:29:40] more beneficial more fulfilling or whatever yeah I think fulfilling is the word yeah like you'll
[04:29:46] you'll feel more purpose like just in your day to day you know just how it works but all right
[04:29:51] think it works like that oh check so origin us a dot com cool awesome to support get it get whatever
[04:29:58] you need there also we got jocquistore dot com which echo Nate made up the name for very original
[04:30:03] yeah because we have a store no I think I accepted the name for us and thank you but did I name it
[04:30:09] literally made it up you know what actually now that you mentioned you actually said to be like
[04:30:13] a dog I'm gonna start a store and it's like oh what's going to be called I don't think I asked
[04:30:18] I was probably like three days later you're like hey I set up the store okay cool yeah you like we'll
[04:30:24] look at the website and I go okay cool what's the website and you're like a jocquistore you know it's
[04:30:28] funny like I'm remembering it and you're correct exactly right I don't know you can tell me anything
[04:30:32] right now and I believe you you're like no you're in post it on me or no you said you know your
[04:30:38] idea is dumb or you you said you know jocquist you wanted to name the store or something
[04:30:43] lame and then I came up I would believe whatever you said yes I was I remember I am remembering it
[04:30:47] now and it's weird because it's not like I was like hey what's the best kind of name for this or
[04:30:54] that you know and I make this it was just like it was just kind of like a foregone conclusion like
[04:30:59] I didn't even really think of it that's like oh let's just just think there's just how yeah so

[04:32:57] It's funny that that academy because you have it under ashlandfront you know and I always
[04:33:04] looked at it or kind of imagined it as essentially oh this is what you you know if you work
[04:33:09] or if you manage a team your boss was something like that oh yeah perfect freaking perfect really
[04:33:14] but when you kind of look into it and you kind of go on there and stuff this is really what it is
[04:33:18] where it's like okay yeah sure I listen to jocco you know sometimes involuntarily against my
[04:33:23] will whatever but let's say involuntary I listen to jocco and you know I have some good advice
[04:33:28] you know and actually if I'm gonna tell the truth here where if I listen to and by the way
[04:33:35] kind of choose what you put in your head and what you listen to right so what choose to listen to you
[04:33:39] most of the time sure so now jocco with all this advice or whatever he actually has
[04:33:45] an online academy like to train you that's literally what it is it is like okay so I'll
[04:33:53] and I kind of took it for granted where I can ask you questions like when I see it easy I can
[04:33:58] literally call you up if you answer you've asked me a lot of questions over the years yes if you
[04:34:03] think about it now I'm not talking about questions about how to do a commira what you have asked me
[04:34:08] but I'm talking you come in with a legitimate scenario that is an instant out family scenario
[04:34:13] I needed advice straight up straight up just the other last time I saw you I asked you what do you
[04:34:18] think about this something about this or this and I need like straight up legitimately needed advice from
[04:34:22] you right now do I give you good advice yes I think so I'm following it I'll tell you that's working
[04:34:26] right now so far I guess it was more of a long-term decision making course straight up
[04:34:32] that we're probably thinking it's the right move because you probably weren't thinking no offense
[04:34:37] you may not have been thinking long-term yeah I'll just make that mistake we think short-term
[04:34:42] yeah what plays out I was it's like one of the things we're you know how you make this decision to
[04:34:47] pursue this it's gonna put this other thing on hold for a long time or you can pursue the other one
[04:34:54] and it'll put this one on hold either indefinitely or for a long time so it's like which one is
[04:34:58] the advice I gave you is very good by the way I agree and even when you said it it
[04:35:03] hit me so quickly that yep I think you're right you know that's a good call so if you didn't know me
[04:35:08] if you weren't we didn't hang out if we weren't doing the digital if we weren't doing the podcast
[04:35:12] and you had that question you could go to extremistrybore.com and literally ask me and I would give you
[04:35:18] the same advice exactly right and that's why I'm getting some more particulars maybe your
[04:35:22] scenario is different maybe your area of operations different but essentially you'd get at least
[04:35:26] now this means I'm gonna preach to you that I know 100% know but I would help you way through the
[04:35:30] options which is what I do with you right yeah exactly right and that's exactly what I was going to say

[04:37:05] shout out cool we appreciate it you want to get a little information about what we're doing cool
[04:37:13] don't get sucked into the aggro rhythm the so listen and I my brain mind and I'm sure a lot of
[04:37:20] people do the same thing where it does this thing where anytime I listen to like micha or
[04:37:26] you know any pretty much anyone's story and you hear those cool little parts of it where it's like
[04:37:31] oh man I need to take away the computer from my kids from now on you know it's like you get sucked into
[04:37:36] a story so much like it's so um what do you call like so engaging that you kind of like I kind of

[04:37:57] one time by the way I'm pretty recently but nonetheless I still had that feeling
[04:38:01] soon saying because you see you get so immersed in like the story or whatever they knew
[04:38:04] he was talking about like the social media and I felt it I was like yeah you write social media so toxic
[04:38:09] but the reality is it can be toxic and it can be very beneficial like you you know and I'm you know
[04:38:17] you can be in communication with very valuable people for very good reasons I've gotten into
[04:38:23] social we've probably gotten 30 guests on this podcast legit awesome guests freaking so stoked
[04:38:32] from social media oh yeah so that's definitely and it's and it is a legitimate way to
