00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.80
This is a Jocko podcast number 343 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:04.80 --> 00:00:07.20
Jocko willing. Good evening Echo. Good evening.

3
00:00:08.40 --> 00:00:10.40
If you know the enemy and you know yourself,

4
00:00:10.40 --> 00:00:13.80
you need not fear the result of a hundred battles.

5
00:00:13.80 --> 00:00:18.40
If you know yourself, but not the enemy for every victory gained,

6
00:00:18.40 --> 00:00:20.40
you will also suffer defeat.

7
00:00:20.40 --> 00:00:22.80
If you know neither the enemy nor yourself,

8
00:00:22.80 --> 00:00:24.000
you will succumb in every battle.

9
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.20
Sun Tzu Art of War covered that on podcast 23, by the way,

10
00:00:29.20 --> 00:00:32.80
which is over five years ago, I believe, at this time.

11
00:00:34.40 --> 00:00:37.20
So it's a real common quote, though.

12
00:00:38.20 --> 00:00:40.000
We have to learn from ourselves.

13
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.20
We have to learn our mistakes.

14
00:00:41.20 --> 00:00:43.000
We have to learn our strengths and weaknesses,

15
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.40
but we have to learn about our enemies

16
00:00:45.40 --> 00:00:47.000
and our enemy's strength and weaknesses.

17
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.40
What do we do right?

18
00:00:48.40 --> 00:00:49.80
What do we do wrong?

19
00:00:49.80 --> 00:00:51.000
What do our enemies do right?

20
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.40
What do our enemies do wrong?

21
00:00:53.40 --> 00:00:55.000
And in order to know those things,

22
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.000
we have to study our enemy.

23
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.80
We have to look at that, look at what they're doing.

24
00:00:57.80 --> 00:00:59.40
At least we should.

25
00:00:59.40 --> 00:01:02.000
We should be looking at our enemy.

26
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.60
And in some good times, we, as a nation,

27
00:01:07.60 --> 00:01:09.40
have been able to do that well.

28
00:01:09.40 --> 00:01:13.000
And we have a case here in 1942,

29
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.60
the U.S. Army Intelligence released a classified report

30
00:01:17.60 --> 00:01:22.40
about the Nazis, who they were, what they did right,

31
00:01:22.40 --> 00:01:25.40
what they did wrong, what they had revealed

32
00:01:25.40 --> 00:01:28.000
in their own manuals.

33
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.000
So we got copies of some of the Nazi manuals

34
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
about leading troops in combat.

35
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
They have interviews or, you know, they had quotes.

36
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
They have quotes from people that they talk to,

37
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
German officers that they talk to.

38
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
And they put this report together.

39
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
It was a classified report.

40
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Eventually it was declassified, obviously.

41
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.60
But I got a copy of it to review.

42
00:01:56.60 --> 00:01:59.60
And, you know, at first you think, oh, what, what, what,

43
00:01:59.60 --> 00:02:01.60
you kind of think, my first thoughts were,

44
00:02:01.60 --> 00:02:02.60
oh, this is going to be really interesting

45
00:02:02.60 --> 00:02:06.60
to see these, these totally different viewpoints

46
00:02:06.60 --> 00:02:08.000
on leadership, right?

47
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.20
Then these are Nazis.

48
00:02:09.20 --> 00:02:11.60
These are the most horrible people ever.

49
00:02:11.60 --> 00:02:13.40
Okay, so this is going to be,

50
00:02:13.40 --> 00:02:15.40
they're going to be totally different.

51
00:02:16.40 --> 00:02:19.40
Well, you're going to see that they're actually

52
00:02:19.40 --> 00:02:20.40
not that different.

53
00:02:20.40 --> 00:02:26.40
And you can see much of what they say at a tactical level

54
00:02:26.40 --> 00:02:31.000
is very similar to what any leader is going to say.

55
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.40
And that sounds crazy, right?

56
00:02:32.40 --> 00:02:35.40
Because, and that's why you got to realize,

57
00:02:35.40 --> 00:02:39.40
and I think when we, when we covered, when we covered Mao,

58
00:02:39.40 --> 00:02:42.80
and, and I remember pointing this out,

59
00:02:42.80 --> 00:02:45.80
Mao, when he's talking, when they're talking about

60
00:02:45.80 --> 00:02:47.80
how to win a war, they're talking about,

61
00:02:47.80 --> 00:02:51.80
well, the main, the main case and point is decentralized command.

62
00:02:51.80 --> 00:02:53.20
Because he's talking about, hey, listen,

63
00:02:53.20 --> 00:02:55.20
the troops out on the battlefield got to make adjustments,

64
00:02:55.20 --> 00:02:57.20
they got to make things happen because they know what's best

65
00:02:57.20 --> 00:02:59.20
for their unit at the time.

66
00:02:59.20 --> 00:03:02.20
And yet this same guy that says that about how to win a war says,

67
00:03:02.20 --> 00:03:05.20
oh, but for the government, we're going to centralize everything.

68
00:03:05.20 --> 00:03:07.20
We're going to centralize farming,

69
00:03:07.20 --> 00:03:09.80
and we're going to tell you what to plant and when to plant

70
00:03:09.80 --> 00:03:11.60
and how much to plant, and you're all going to die

71
00:03:11.60 --> 00:03:15.20
because it's not going to work, which is exactly what happened.

72
00:03:15.20 --> 00:03:22.20
So it's a similar thing here where you can see clearly

73
00:03:22.20 --> 00:03:25.20
that there's a huge disconnect between the,

74
00:03:25.20 --> 00:03:31.20
the leadership on the battlefield and then what's going on with the,

75
00:03:31.20 --> 00:03:36.20
with Hitler, the Nazis, and the way that they were thinking,

76
00:03:36.20 --> 00:03:38.20
the way Hitler was thinking.

77
00:03:38.20 --> 00:03:42.20
But some of the stuff is pretty disturbing too.

78
00:03:42.20 --> 00:03:48.20
When you, when you think about how this whole nation was captivated,

79
00:03:48.20 --> 00:03:51.20
and you know, this is something that the plasticity of the human mind

80
00:03:51.20 --> 00:03:53.20
is something I've been talking, I've been talking a lot about it on,

81
00:03:53.20 --> 00:03:59.20
on the Academy and just how people are so gullible.

82
00:03:59.20 --> 00:04:02.20
And it's, they can, if you're not careful,

83
00:04:02.20 --> 00:04:04.20
you can get manipulated very easily.

84
00:04:04.20 --> 00:04:07.20
And there's no greater example of that than,

85
00:04:07.20 --> 00:04:10.20
than the Nazi party in Nazi Germany.

86
00:04:10.20 --> 00:04:16.20
Just manipulation of the brain, people, people, crowd mob mentality,

87
00:04:16.20 --> 00:04:18.20
which we talked about in the underground mob mentality going on,

88
00:04:18.20 --> 00:04:23.20
and if that, well, he's doing it, she's doing it, I guess we're doing it, and let's go.

89
00:04:23.20 --> 00:04:27.20
And then you think about, you think about how, I mean, look at society today.

90
00:04:27.20 --> 00:04:29.20
Look at American society today.

91
00:04:29.20 --> 00:04:32.20
Look at trend that'll go across American society today,

92
00:04:32.20 --> 00:04:36.20
and you'll think, whoa, that's a trend, we can spot it.

93
00:04:36.20 --> 00:04:38.20
But people still do it, right?

94
00:04:38.20 --> 00:04:42.20
People are in the trend, and they're believing it.

95
00:04:42.20 --> 00:04:45.20
Same thing happens with the Nazis.

96
00:04:45.20 --> 00:04:51.20
But here's the thing, you think, have you ever known a 27-year-old person

97
00:04:51.20 --> 00:04:55.20
that got caught up in some trend and kind of went down in some weird way?

98
00:04:55.20 --> 00:04:56.20
Went down.

99
00:04:56.20 --> 00:04:59.20
Went down, yeah, like went, went off, let's say, went,

100
00:04:59.20 --> 00:05:02.20
changed directions pretty radically in their life.

101
00:05:02.20 --> 00:05:04.20
27-year-old human.

102
00:05:04.20 --> 00:05:06.20
Yeah, I mean, yeah.

103
00:05:06.20 --> 00:05:09.20
What about a 32-year-old human?

104
00:05:09.20 --> 00:05:10.20
Yeah.

105
00:05:10.20 --> 00:05:16.20
Okay, now, once somebody's 50 or 60, you ever know someone that's 50 or 60?

106
00:05:16.20 --> 00:05:17.20
No.

107
00:05:17.20 --> 00:05:19.20
It can still happen, but more rare, right?

108
00:05:19.20 --> 00:05:20.20
Yeah, yeah.

109
00:05:20.20 --> 00:05:25.20
I mean, basically, as you get older, you're a little harder to manipulate, it would seem.

110
00:05:25.20 --> 00:05:26.20
It seems that way, yeah.

111
00:05:26.20 --> 00:05:33.20
But then when you start talking about 10, 11, 12-year-olds, these are super pliable brains.

112
00:05:33.20 --> 00:05:36.20
And so when I start talking about the Hitler youth, you're going to be thinking,

113
00:05:36.20 --> 00:05:38.20
you keep that in mind.

114
00:05:38.20 --> 00:05:43.20
Here's a 10-year-old kid, an 11-year-old kid that's getting indoctrinated,

115
00:05:43.20 --> 00:05:45.20
that doesn't know anything else.

116
00:05:45.20 --> 00:05:49.20
Then you can see where that's going to end up.

117
00:05:49.20 --> 00:05:55.20
So the thing about the Third Reich from a military and leadership perspective,

118
00:05:55.20 --> 00:06:01.20
look, there was a lot of them, 13, almost 14 million soldiers in the German army,

119
00:06:01.20 --> 00:06:04.20
and they were efficient.

120
00:06:04.20 --> 00:06:05.20
They were efficient.

121
00:06:05.20 --> 00:06:09.20
And they use, you're going to see, and I don't speak German, obviously,

122
00:06:09.20 --> 00:06:12.20
but the translation, they use that term efficiency a lot,

123
00:06:12.20 --> 00:06:17.20
almost like it's a little bit scary, you know, where it's like, hey, is it,

124
00:06:17.20 --> 00:06:21.20
wouldn't it be more efficient if you only had three kids instead of four?

125
00:06:21.20 --> 00:06:22.20
You know what I'm saying?

126
00:06:22.20 --> 00:06:25.20
Like that kind of scary thing.

127
00:06:25.20 --> 00:06:30.20
So we're going to come across that word efficiency.

128
00:06:30.20 --> 00:06:35.20
And the German military, the Third Reich military,

129
00:06:35.20 --> 00:06:39.20
was very effective and efficient at the beginning of the war.

130
00:06:39.20 --> 00:06:41.20
And many people would, I mean, look at what they did.

131
00:06:41.20 --> 00:06:44.20
They rolled, they steamrolled through Europe very easily.

132
00:06:44.20 --> 00:06:49.20
And a lot of people would say that they continued to keep up a very efficient methodology

133
00:06:49.20 --> 00:06:54.20
until that's when the Nazi generals were running the show.

134
00:06:54.20 --> 00:06:58.20
When you had guys like Rommel that was actually making calls.

135
00:06:58.20 --> 00:07:03.20
Rommel, who by the way, eventually got executed by Hitler.

136
00:07:03.20 --> 00:07:06.20
But he was, you know, he was one of the guys that was running the show.

137
00:07:06.20 --> 00:07:12.20
And the further along the war went, the more Hitler started calling the shots.

138
00:07:12.20 --> 00:07:18.20
But they had some things that were causing them to be so effective early in the war.

139
00:07:18.20 --> 00:07:22.20
You know, they used mission type orders that utilized decentralized command,

140
00:07:22.20 --> 00:07:27.20
not so much a leadership perspective, but they had some really good weapons.

141
00:07:27.20 --> 00:07:35.20
And H. Liddell Hart, who we've covered on this podcast, he, he, here's a quote from him from, from his studies.

142
00:07:35.20 --> 00:07:41.20
On a man for man basis, German ground soldiers consistently inflicted casualties

143
00:07:41.20 --> 00:07:47.20
at about a 50% higher rate than they incurred from the opposing British and American troops

144
00:07:47.20 --> 00:07:49.20
under all circumstances.

145
00:07:49.20 --> 00:07:53.20
This was true when they were attacking and when they were defending,

146
00:07:53.20 --> 00:07:59.20
when they had a local numerical superiority and when, as was usually the case,

147
00:07:59.20 --> 00:08:03.20
they were outnumbered, when they had air superiority and when they did not,

148
00:08:03.20 --> 00:08:07.20
when they won and when they lost.

149
00:08:07.20 --> 00:08:13.20
So they were good at inflicting casualties on American and British troops.

150
00:08:13.20 --> 00:08:17.20
They were better than we were in inflicting casualties on them.

151
00:08:17.20 --> 00:08:25.20
That being said, we had, you know, obviously more numbers and more aggressiveness over an extended period of time.

152
00:08:25.20 --> 00:08:30.20
But that's just one example of the effectiveness of the German military in World War II,

153
00:08:30.20 --> 00:08:33.20
again, especially in the beginning of the war.

154
00:08:33.20 --> 00:08:40.20
And, and there's, there's more points like that, but I don't want to, I don't want to drill down onto that debate

155
00:08:40.20 --> 00:08:44.20
or, or go deeper into that.

156
00:08:44.20 --> 00:08:55.20
But there's no one that's going to say that the early German World War II military was not an extremely effective military force.

157
00:08:55.20 --> 00:09:03.20
And of course, I mean, we have to say that it did fall apart eventually against an incredibly adaptive and brave and smart and capable allied force.

158
00:09:03.20 --> 00:09:10.20
And I would say one of the best things about us Americans is we learned and we adapted.

159
00:09:10.20 --> 00:09:19.20
And I think that's something that maybe, you know, part of our culture is that we are able to do that.

160
00:09:19.20 --> 00:09:25.20
And when we allow ourselves to do that, it's going to be one of the most beneficial things we can do is go, oh, you know what, this isn't working, do something else.

161
00:09:25.20 --> 00:09:28.20
And I would say that the Germans were kind of the opposite.

162
00:09:28.20 --> 00:09:36.20
The further the war went, the less they adapted, the less they changed their, their strategies and their tactics.

163
00:09:36.20 --> 00:09:40.20
And what causes you to not change your strategies and tactics, it's when your ego gets too big.

164
00:09:40.20 --> 00:09:43.20
What causes your ego to get big when you're winning a lot.

165
00:09:43.20 --> 00:09:44.20
So what, just look what happened.

166
00:09:44.20 --> 00:09:46.20
The Germans are winning a bunch.

167
00:09:46.20 --> 00:09:48.20
They don't, they think that everything they're doing is right.

168
00:09:48.20 --> 00:09:49.20
We're losing.

169
00:09:49.20 --> 00:09:50.20
We're like, okay, we got to make adjustments.

170
00:09:50.20 --> 00:09:52.20
The British are saying we got to make adjustments.

171
00:09:52.20 --> 00:09:53.20
So we start making adjustments.

172
00:09:53.20 --> 00:09:54.20
They don't.

173
00:09:54.20 --> 00:09:56.20
We win.

174
00:09:56.20 --> 00:10:00.20
Look, ultimate simplified terms, right?

175
00:10:00.20 --> 00:10:02.20
And I'm not trying to make a historical case.

176
00:10:02.20 --> 00:10:08.20
I'm just trying to review an assessment of some mindsets broadly speaking.

177
00:10:08.20 --> 00:10:14.20
So this report is, is an interesting report.

178
00:10:14.20 --> 00:10:20.20
Again, it's written in 1942 and let's take a look at it.

179
00:10:20.20 --> 00:10:21.20
What can we learn from it?

180
00:10:21.20 --> 00:10:22.20
That's the main thing.

181
00:10:22.20 --> 00:10:23.20
What can we learn from it?

182
00:10:23.20 --> 00:10:25.20
So this is September 17th, 1942.

183
00:10:25.20 --> 00:10:29.20
The, the report is called German military training.

184
00:10:29.20 --> 00:10:33.20
And it comes from the military intelligence service of the war department.

185
00:10:33.20 --> 00:10:39.20
Notice the information summarized here is based on a variety of sources on German manuals,

186
00:10:39.20 --> 00:10:44.20
on technical articles in German military reviews, and above all, on the detailed reports of

187
00:10:44.20 --> 00:10:49.20
United States observers who saw the German army at close range in its work of preparing

188
00:10:49.20 --> 00:10:53.20
for this war and during the first two years of conflict.

189
00:10:53.20 --> 00:10:56.20
That's where it came from.

190
00:10:56.20 --> 00:10:58.20
Introduction.

191
00:10:58.20 --> 00:11:03.20
The bullet, this bulletin proposes to summarize information which will serve three purposes.

192
00:11:03.20 --> 00:11:08.20
One, it will permit a better appreciation of the basis of the German military strength.

193
00:11:08.20 --> 00:11:13.20
The strength of the German army and its early success in this war owe much to two factors,

194
00:11:13.20 --> 00:11:15.20
planning and training.

195
00:11:15.20 --> 00:11:20.20
The Nazi leaders planned this war for years in advance of their attack.

196
00:11:20.20 --> 00:11:26.20
They prepared for it by a system of military training which begins with children of high school age.

197
00:11:26.20 --> 00:11:29.20
The training system was directed by the old professional army.

198
00:11:29.20 --> 00:11:35.20
It depended on effort, thoroughness, and the appre, and the application of old and tested principles

199
00:11:35.20 --> 00:11:37.20
to the means of modern warfare.

200
00:11:37.20 --> 00:11:44.20
As an observer remarks, the Germans believed that by hard work and hard training, they would quote,

201
00:11:44.20 --> 00:11:45.20
save blood later.

202
00:11:45.20 --> 00:11:49.20
And that's almost like a word for word quote from Patton.

203
00:11:49.20 --> 00:11:55.20
This training gave the German army a time advantage over its rivals, although this advantage is being

204
00:11:55.20 --> 00:11:57.20
steadily reduced.

205
00:11:57.20 --> 00:12:03.20
Number two, it will contribute to our knowledge of characteristic German tactics.

206
00:12:03.20 --> 00:12:09.20
Those principles of tactics and leadership which are emphasized in training are inevitably reflected

207
00:12:09.20 --> 00:12:12.20
in the actual conduct of operations.

208
00:12:12.20 --> 00:12:18.20
While this bulletin will make no detailed study of German tactics, it will bring out the main doctrines

209
00:12:18.20 --> 00:12:21.20
which are applied in battle as a result of training.

210
00:12:21.20 --> 00:12:30.20
Number three, it will suggest methods and points of view which may be useful in training U.S. troops.

211
00:12:30.20 --> 00:12:32.20
So like what can we learn from this?

212
00:12:32.20 --> 00:12:33.20
That's what they're saying.

213
00:12:33.20 --> 00:12:38.20
There are many basic similarities between U.S. training doctrines and those of the German army.

214
00:12:38.20 --> 00:12:44.20
Though there are naturally many differences in their use or application, we can learn from the differences

215
00:12:44.20 --> 00:12:46.20
as well as the similarities.

216
00:12:46.20 --> 00:12:52.20
As far as possible, concrete examples have been given and in the appendixes there are detailed illustrations

217
00:12:52.20 --> 00:12:57.20
at some length of certain phases of the German training methods.

218
00:12:57.20 --> 00:13:01.20
So training in preparation for military service.

219
00:13:01.20 --> 00:13:02.20
This is where you start thinking.

220
00:13:02.20 --> 00:13:07.20
This is when you start thinking this is going to be a problem.

221
00:13:07.20 --> 00:13:09.20
If you're watching this, this is from 1934.

222
00:13:09.20 --> 00:13:11.20
If you're watching this from the outside, you got to be thinking yourself.

223
00:13:11.20 --> 00:13:13.20
This is going to be an issue.

224
00:13:13.20 --> 00:13:14.20
Here's what they got going on.

225
00:13:14.20 --> 00:13:19.20
The Nazi government from the start was dedicated to the purpose of war of conquest.

226
00:13:19.20 --> 00:13:25.20
And from 1934 on, the party controlled and directed every aspect of German life to the same.

227
00:13:25.20 --> 00:13:33.20
So right there, if you're looking on the outside, you got to realize we're going to have an issue.

228
00:13:33.20 --> 00:13:37.20
This is like someone that's training, lifting, doing Jiu Jitsu.

229
00:13:37.20 --> 00:13:40.20
Like this whole person's life is for war.

230
00:13:40.20 --> 00:13:43.20
That's what the whole German world was.

231
00:13:43.20 --> 00:13:46.20
The German military leadership followed Klaus Witz for years,

232
00:13:46.20 --> 00:13:51.20
but only under the Nazi regime could his key concept of total war be realized.

233
00:13:51.20 --> 00:13:58.20
The principle that every agency and every individual of a nation must be used in the effort of war.

234
00:13:58.20 --> 00:14:03.20
Nothing is more revealing of Nazi plans and methods than the application of this principle

235
00:14:03.20 --> 00:14:07.20
in a very broad program of military training.

236
00:14:07.20 --> 00:14:11.20
The goal of this program was a large and highly trained army,

237
00:14:11.20 --> 00:14:16.20
but the shaping of this army was not left to the two years of actual military training for conscripts.

238
00:14:16.20 --> 00:14:22.20
From the age of 14, boys were to receive a preparation for military service

239
00:14:22.20 --> 00:14:27.20
which would cover much of the basic training ordinarily given recruits.

240
00:14:27.20 --> 00:14:31.20
So starting at age 14, you're starting to get trained.

241
00:14:31.20 --> 00:14:33.20
At age 14.

242
00:14:33.20 --> 00:14:36.20
So you're getting indoctrinated and you're getting trained at age 14.

243
00:14:36.20 --> 00:14:42.20
In addition, men older than conscript age with or without previous military service

244
00:14:42.20 --> 00:14:47.20
were to be given various types of auxiliary background or refresher training.

245
00:14:47.20 --> 00:14:49.20
It doesn't matter who you are.

246
00:14:49.20 --> 00:14:51.20
If you're not in the military, you're getting military training.

247
00:14:51.20 --> 00:14:55.20
Ages 14 to 60.

248
00:14:55.20 --> 00:15:00.20
The Nazi party through its various branches was mainly responsible for civilian training outside the army proper.

249
00:15:00.20 --> 00:15:05.20
This included due concern for specialized training and skills needed for mechanized warfare.

250
00:15:05.20 --> 00:15:13.20
A national socialist flying corps sponsored instruction in the rudiments of flying and in glider practice.

251
00:15:13.20 --> 00:15:20.20
The national socialist motor corps trained a large reserve of youths in all type of driving for mechanized service

252
00:15:20.20 --> 00:15:24.20
and thus relieved army motor schools of many hours of instruction.

253
00:15:24.20 --> 00:15:32.20
A German article in 1940 claimed that 125,000 men had been given experience in military motorization.

254
00:15:32.20 --> 00:15:39.20
A motor boat corps cooperated with the army and marines to prepare men for water transport operations.

255
00:15:39.20 --> 00:15:42.20
So think about that.

256
00:15:42.20 --> 00:15:51.20
You've got 125,000 men that had been trained to drive vehicles, large vehicles, military type vehicles.

257
00:15:51.20 --> 00:15:58.20
I mean, right now there's only 400,000 men or women in the US army right now.

258
00:15:58.20 --> 00:16:03.20
So think about having 125,000 people that you control that have this skill and they haven't even been trained yet.

259
00:16:03.20 --> 00:16:07.20
You just got them.

260
00:16:07.20 --> 00:16:11.20
And by the way, you've got people that know how to work on the vehicles.

261
00:16:11.20 --> 00:16:20.20
And by the way, you've got a whole bunch of people that know how to fly planes, kids that know how to fly gliders.

262
00:16:20.20 --> 00:16:25.20
The activities of the party are particularly concerned with the indoctrination of all German citizens for war.

263
00:16:25.20 --> 00:16:30.20
The basic ideas in this indoctrination are well known and are reiterated in Hitler's speeches.

264
00:16:30.20 --> 00:16:37.20
The theory of Germany's natural rights, the concept of the master race, the exaltation of the state and leader,

265
00:16:37.20 --> 00:16:40.20
the glorification of war and military virtues.

266
00:16:40.20 --> 00:16:52.20
The schools, press, radio and movies are controlled by the party and support its efforts in every direction by propaganda which has to fear no rival.

267
00:16:52.20 --> 00:16:56.20
The penal code prevents any free discussion in the field of ideas.

268
00:16:56.20 --> 00:17:06.20
Every German household belongs to a local unit organized to carry out the party educational program.

269
00:17:06.20 --> 00:17:08.20
So they're down for the cause.

270
00:17:08.20 --> 00:17:10.20
There's no, you don't know anything else.

271
00:17:10.20 --> 00:17:11.20
Yeah.

272
00:17:11.20 --> 00:17:16.20
And if you think about anything else, you're going to get found out and you're going to get straightened out.

273
00:17:16.20 --> 00:17:21.20
That's what's going on.

274
00:17:21.20 --> 00:17:29.20
A German lieutenant has summoned up this work of indoctrination in his parents' home, in school, in the Hitler youth,

275
00:17:29.20 --> 00:17:34.20
in the subdivisions of the movement, in the shop and in the labor service.

276
00:17:34.20 --> 00:17:38.20
The future army recruit has been bred as a national socialist.

277
00:17:38.20 --> 00:17:49.20
He does not know anything else but allegiance to the national socialist state and the life work of being a German.

278
00:17:49.20 --> 00:17:54.20
There you go.

279
00:17:54.20 --> 00:17:59.20
Training of the German youth, the Hitler youth, at the age of 10.

280
00:17:59.20 --> 00:18:06.20
German boys are brought into the Nazi scheme as members of the Jungvok,

281
00:18:06.20 --> 00:18:10.20
organization and receive their first taste of official indoctrination.

282
00:18:10.20 --> 00:18:15.20
Real shaping for the army begins at 14 when they enter the Hitler youth.

283
00:18:15.20 --> 00:18:21.20
Even before the war, this organization was mainly concerned with preparing boys for the army,

284
00:18:21.20 --> 00:18:25.20
both by instilling military mental attitudes and by military training.

285
00:18:25.20 --> 00:18:31.20
A U.S. observer gives the following description of an exercise of German boys carried out on a Sunday morning.

286
00:18:31.20 --> 00:18:33.20
So this is a Sunday morning.

287
00:18:33.20 --> 00:18:39.20
We got some German boys out there doing some, doing an exercise.

288
00:18:39.20 --> 00:18:46.20
Two groups, one mixed, one of mixed Hitler youth and one of, one of Jungvok.

289
00:18:46.20 --> 00:18:51.20
Thirty strong and the other a similar group of 22 cyclists on 11 bicycles,

290
00:18:51.20 --> 00:18:55.20
marched into Greenwald Forest under the command of a Hitler youth.

291
00:18:55.20 --> 00:18:58.20
This boy appeared to be 15 or 16 years of age.

292
00:18:58.20 --> 00:19:01.20
He halted his command, dressed it with skill and precision,

293
00:19:01.20 --> 00:19:04.20
and announced his mission in a clear and definite manner.

294
00:19:04.20 --> 00:19:08.20
The enemy is reported advancing from the south to the north through Greenwald Forest.

295
00:19:08.20 --> 00:19:11.20
At 7 o'clock he was reported to be entering the, etc., etc.

296
00:19:11.20 --> 00:19:16.20
My mission is to determine at once and report to headquarters the position and activity of advanced units.

297
00:19:16.20 --> 00:19:18.20
My sector is, etc., etc.

298
00:19:18.20 --> 00:19:24.20
It will not be necessary to go into the young commander's estimate of the situation in his orders to his subordinates.

299
00:19:24.20 --> 00:19:28.20
They would have done credit to a professional army officer.

300
00:19:28.20 --> 00:19:30.20
This is a 15-year-old kid.

301
00:19:30.20 --> 00:19:34.20
That boy, still two or three years from active service as a private in the army,

302
00:19:34.20 --> 00:19:39.20
was able to estimate a difficult situation and organize and put in execution a rather complex plan

303
00:19:39.20 --> 00:19:44.20
to carry out his mission on a sector of, sector nearly a thousand meters wide.

304
00:19:44.20 --> 00:19:47.20
This demanded an extended series of rapid-fire orders.

305
00:19:47.20 --> 00:19:50.20
It was evident that he had control of his boys.

306
00:19:50.20 --> 00:19:55.20
A continuous stream of bicycle messengers carried his reports from advanced units to the leader's posts.

307
00:19:55.20 --> 00:20:00.20
He, in turn, sent frequent written messages to some post to his rear.

308
00:20:00.20 --> 00:20:05.20
The observer was frankly amazed at this performance and spent the entire morning with this group to be sure

309
00:20:05.20 --> 00:20:09.20
there was a certain amount of laughing and horseplay among the boys.

310
00:20:09.20 --> 00:20:15.20
This was not repressed, but any lack of attention to duty called forth an immediate and severe rebuke from the leaders.

311
00:20:15.20 --> 00:20:18.20
It was evident that the youngster in charge was on his own.

312
00:20:18.20 --> 00:20:23.20
Some other means must have been provided for checking up on how well that youthful commander had accomplished his mission.

313
00:20:23.20 --> 00:20:27.20
Two of his units, one boy each, failed to follow instructions.

314
00:20:27.20 --> 00:20:30.20
Some were lost and some had difficulty in reporting clearly what they saw.

315
00:20:30.20 --> 00:20:34.20
Some failed in their individual missions, but the boy leader did not fail in his.

316
00:20:34.20 --> 00:20:37.20
He finally recalled all of his units with skill, marched them to the rear,

317
00:20:37.20 --> 00:20:40.20
and very ably praised and criticized individual performance.

318
00:20:40.20 --> 00:20:45.20
On the whole, it was a remarkable demonstration of how German military leadership is developed.

319
00:20:45.20 --> 00:20:57.20
14 or 15 year old leader and then a bunch of 10 year old little Nazi soldiers out there on a Sunday.

320
00:21:01.20 --> 00:21:06.20
Another observer saw Hitler Youth Organization engaged in battalion maneuvers

321
00:21:06.20 --> 00:21:15.20
and reports that their performance would be credible to regular troops.

322
00:21:15.20 --> 00:21:22.20
In 1939, the stormtrooper section of the Nazi party took charge of the Hitler Youth.

323
00:21:22.20 --> 00:21:29.20
And after the start of war, boys 16 to 18 years of age were compelled to take six months of regular pre-military work.

324
00:21:29.20 --> 00:21:35.20
The aim was to provide the army with the largest possible reserve of mentally, physically, and militarily trained young men.

325
00:21:35.20 --> 00:21:40.20
The training includes infantry fundamentals, care and use of weapons, and signaling.

326
00:21:40.20 --> 00:21:45.20
The Hitler Youth has been used in a variety of auxiliary services during the war,

327
00:21:45.20 --> 00:21:50.20
spotting aircraft, performing office work at airports, painting runways, harvesting crops,

328
00:21:50.20 --> 00:21:57.20
tending children in day nurseries, collecting useful junk and trash, soliciting for the winter help,

329
00:21:57.20 --> 00:22:04.20
singing at the hospitals, and putting on entertainment for soldiers at the front.

330
00:22:04.20 --> 00:22:12.20
And obviously as the war went on and they lost more adult males, the Hitler Youth started fighting as well.

331
00:22:12.20 --> 00:22:14.20
But this is where they started off.

332
00:22:14.20 --> 00:22:20.20
The following statistics based on estimate by a U.S. observer suggest the scope of the variety of the Hitler Youth activities.

333
00:22:20.20 --> 00:22:35.20
The National Socialist Flying Corps furnished the Hitler Youth flyers with enough gliders, planes, and instructors to teach 135,000 boys how to fly each year.

334
00:22:35.20 --> 00:22:41.20
The motorized units of the Hitler Youth enrolled 295,000 boys each year.

335
00:22:41.20 --> 00:22:50.20
The National Socialist Party set up 1,300 repair shops for the units, and each year provided them with 5,000 motorcycles.

336
00:22:50.20 --> 00:22:56.20
The Hitler Youth Marines had an annual enrollment of 78,000.

337
00:22:56.20 --> 00:23:02.20
The National Socialist Party supplied the Hitler Youth with 10,000 revolvers a year and a large number of rifles.

338
00:23:02.20 --> 00:23:09.20
Enough rifles were furnished to enable 30,000 outstanding marksmen to participate in rifle matches.

339
00:23:09.20 --> 00:23:13.20
The Hitler Youth had its own firearms school.

340
00:23:13.20 --> 00:23:25.20
During an average 12 months, the Hitler Youth conducted 3,540 official outdoor camps which were attended by 565,000 boys.

341
00:23:25.20 --> 00:23:28.20
That's every 12 months.

342
00:23:28.20 --> 00:23:32.20
That's bigger than the U.S. Army, by the way.

343
00:23:32.20 --> 00:23:35.20
565,000. That's bigger than the U.S. Army.

344
00:23:35.20 --> 00:23:38.20
That's bigger than the United States Marine Corps.

345
00:23:38.20 --> 00:23:48.20
Let me ask you this. What's your current feeling about this? Does this sound like real sinister or does it sound like kind of squared away?

346
00:23:48.20 --> 00:23:50.20
Well, it's both.

347
00:23:50.20 --> 00:23:52.20
Yeah, that's kind of why I asked.

348
00:23:52.20 --> 00:23:56.20
Because the part of me is kind of like, well, just because it's overshadowed by the fact that it's the Nazis.

349
00:23:56.20 --> 00:24:00.20
It's like, oh my gosh, this seems real sinister. But you get that part away.

350
00:24:00.20 --> 00:24:05.20
Like, what, if it was like for something good, it's kind of like that's a squared away group right there.

351
00:24:05.20 --> 00:24:12.20
But that much preparation from that early on, that many capable people starting from that early, that's kind of solid.

352
00:24:12.20 --> 00:24:17.20
Like, you could apply that concept to some good things and that might help us.

353
00:24:17.20 --> 00:24:23.20
Yeah. Well, unfortunately for you, that little part about them being Nazis is a real friggin' problem.

354
00:24:23.20 --> 00:24:25.20
It's a big deal.

355
00:24:25.20 --> 00:24:28.20
It's a real problem. But there's a whole bunch of things going on there.

356
00:24:28.20 --> 00:24:34.20
Just the fact that their foresight is so strong that they're going, hey, look, we're going to be fighting a war in X numbers.

357
00:24:34.20 --> 00:24:39.20
We need people that can work on vehicles. We need people that can fly planes. We need people that can drive vehicles.

358
00:24:39.20 --> 00:24:42.20
We need people that can fight. We need people that can shoot well.

359
00:24:42.20 --> 00:24:44.20
Like, they're just covering all the bases.

360
00:24:44.20 --> 00:24:52.20
Yeah. And obviously the part that's very glaring, besides the fact that they're Nazis, is how they're forced.

361
00:24:52.20 --> 00:24:57.20
Like, the use of fort where they have to do it. And if you even think about other stuff, that's a violation.

362
00:24:57.20 --> 00:24:58.20
Yeah.

363
00:24:58.20 --> 00:25:10.20
And we'd have to, I'd have to do some more research on this, but I can tell you from what I know, the term forced is not like a great term to use.

364
00:25:10.20 --> 00:25:21.20
Because everyone was so swept up in the movement that it was more like, that's like saying during World War II in America, you know, Americans were forced to start a victory garden.

365
00:25:21.20 --> 00:25:33.20
You know what a victory garden is? Victory gardens where you go out in your yard and you plant tomatoes and carrots for yourself so you didn't have to get stuff from the store.

366
00:25:33.20 --> 00:25:37.20
So everyone didn't need to take supplies away from the soldiers.

367
00:25:37.20 --> 00:25:41.20
Well, you didn't get forced to do that. You did that because that's what we were doing to help out.

368
00:25:41.20 --> 00:25:42.20
Yeah, yeah, okay.

369
00:25:42.20 --> 00:25:48.20
So when you see like the young Hitler youth, they're not like being dragged away to camp.

370
00:25:48.20 --> 00:25:54.20
No, they're fired up to go. And that's what we're doing. And that's what they've been told.

371
00:25:54.20 --> 00:25:58.20
And they're also getting told like, well, this is what we do. And this is what makes us better than everyone else.

372
00:25:58.20 --> 00:26:04.20
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, you're right. That is, that is there still seems sinister.

373
00:26:04.20 --> 00:26:06.20
Oh, it's 100% sinister.

374
00:26:06.20 --> 00:26:09.20
But yeah, it is different because the ultimate purpose is we're going to take over the world.

375
00:26:09.20 --> 00:26:10.20
Yeah.

376
00:26:10.20 --> 00:26:19.20
The last part there, it says in one year, 6 million German boys participated in sports events organized by the Hitler Youth Office.

377
00:26:19.20 --> 00:26:31.20
Next section is labor service at the age of 18, German boys entered a, entered a compulsory labor service for a six month term.

378
00:26:31.20 --> 00:26:35.20
The labor service work gave them excellent conditioning and hardening.

379
00:26:35.20 --> 00:26:40.20
Furthermore, it accustomed men to living in groups under military discipline.

380
00:26:40.20 --> 00:26:46.20
And again, you know what? This is what's interesting about the military.

381
00:26:46.20 --> 00:26:51.20
That stuff brings you together and makes you feel good and makes you a better person.

382
00:26:51.20 --> 00:26:56.20
And it makes you bond with your friends. You want to want to get people together.

383
00:26:56.20 --> 00:26:59.20
You want to want to people to bond, put make them do hard stuff together.

384
00:26:59.20 --> 00:27:03.20
That's literally how you make people bond shared suffering.

385
00:27:03.20 --> 00:27:05.20
So we're going to go out, we're going to work really hard in the fields.

386
00:27:05.20 --> 00:27:09.20
And at the end of the day, we're going to come back and we're going to have meals together.

387
00:27:09.20 --> 00:27:13.20
And we're going to go out and do the next thing, the same thing the next day.

388
00:27:13.20 --> 00:27:16.20
And people that work hard are going to be rewarded.

389
00:27:16.20 --> 00:27:19.20
And people that slack off are going to be cast out.

390
00:27:19.20 --> 00:27:21.20
So you see what I'm saying here.

391
00:27:21.20 --> 00:27:24.20
This is like a huge unifying thing.

392
00:27:24.20 --> 00:27:28.20
It's not that it's not forced labor like, oh, God, they're going to put no.

393
00:27:28.20 --> 00:27:30.20
Oh, here's your chance.

394
00:27:30.20 --> 00:27:36.20
Hey, you're going to get to go to get to go to the the the labor service.

395
00:27:36.20 --> 00:27:38.20
Oh, you're old enough to do labor service now.

396
00:27:38.20 --> 00:27:41.20
It's going to be great.

397
00:27:41.20 --> 00:27:49.20
With the outbreak of the war, most of the male labor service units were transferred to the armed forces to serve as construction companies.

398
00:27:49.20 --> 00:27:53.20
And the size of the units were increased from 200 to 400 in some cases, 600.

399
00:27:53.20 --> 00:28:03.20
On December 20, 1939, a law ordered that normal labor service for men was to continue despite the special war work of the construction companies.

400
00:28:03.20 --> 00:28:11.20
The labor service youths performed miscellaneous tasks in rear areas being kept out of combat areas as much as possible.

401
00:28:11.20 --> 00:28:17.20
And also says generally the girls branch performs none of these duties except pertaining to agriculture.

402
00:28:17.20 --> 00:28:19.20
They work in factories and do other types of work on the home front.

403
00:28:19.20 --> 00:28:22.20
So the females were going into this too.

404
00:28:22.20 --> 00:28:32.20
But the males were cultivating farms in occupied areas, doing agricultural work in Germany, wherever there are labor shortages, constructing and maintaining important highways,

405
00:28:32.20 --> 00:28:41.20
constructing and improving fortifications, bridges and airports, salvaging equipment, munitions and material and battle areas, policing battlefields, performing century duty in occupied areas,

406
00:28:41.20 --> 00:28:48.20
camouflaging and sandbagging military establishments and assisting in the transportation of food ammunition and fuel during rapid military advances.

407
00:28:48.20 --> 00:28:51.20
So they're basically just full combat support.

408
00:28:51.20 --> 00:28:55.20
And where does this end up?

409
00:28:55.20 --> 00:28:56.20
Here's the conclusion.

410
00:28:56.20 --> 00:29:04.20
When German youths at 19 were inducted for military service, most of them had already had the equivalent of basic military training works,

411
00:29:04.20 --> 00:29:10.20
where an excellent physical condition and had been indoctrinated both with Nazi ideology and military attitudes.

412
00:29:10.20 --> 00:29:16.20
As a result, their training period as conscripts could move very rapidly through preliminary stages.

413
00:29:16.20 --> 00:29:24.20
In two or three months, the conscripts could take part in maneuvers involving divisions or armies because of the work done by the Hitler Youth and the Labor Service.

414
00:29:24.20 --> 00:29:30.20
The two-year training in the army could advance much more rapidly and effectively.

415
00:29:30.20 --> 00:29:33.20
So that's a brilliant plan.

416
00:29:33.20 --> 00:29:38.20
Hey, when people are finally ready to serve at 19, we're already going to have them almost completely trained up.

417
00:29:38.20 --> 00:29:41.20
They're going to be almost completely trained up.

418
00:29:41.20 --> 00:29:47.20
We're going to have to waste, I mean, Marine Corps bootcamp is 13 weeks, and then you go to the School of Infantry.

419
00:29:47.20 --> 00:29:54.20
The army bootcamp is, I don't know, eight weeks, and then you go to AIT, the Army Infantry Training.

420
00:29:54.20 --> 00:29:56.20
So it's going to take some time.

421
00:29:56.20 --> 00:29:59.20
It's going to take four, five, six months to get someone ready to fight.

422
00:29:59.20 --> 00:30:05.20
They're cutting two, three, four months out of that program, which is a big deal.

423
00:30:05.20 --> 00:30:11.20
Furthermore, German boys had received good opportunity to practice and develop qualities of leadership,

424
00:30:11.20 --> 00:30:16.20
and officer material was already clearly marked out by the time they reached military age.

425
00:30:16.20 --> 00:30:18.20
So they're looking for leaders.

426
00:30:24.20 --> 00:30:32.20
Next section, work of the essay, the stormtroopers, the brown shirts, which is the Nazi paramilitary wing.

427
00:30:32.20 --> 00:30:40.20
One of the most active branches of the Nazi party, the essay, had particular responsibility and connection with the Hitler youth.

428
00:30:40.20 --> 00:30:49.20
In addition, the essay performed important functions in giving a certain amount of military training to older civilians both within and outside its own ranks.

429
00:30:49.20 --> 00:30:56.20
The essay as a military reserve, when the Nazi party was rising to power, the essay and the elite guard, the SS, was in effect a private army of Hitler.

430
00:30:56.20 --> 00:31:04.20
When he seized control of the state, the essay was gradually merged into the framework of the military system and became more closely connected with the regular army.

431
00:31:04.20 --> 00:31:10.20
By 1935, more than 100 divisions called brigade of essay troops had been organized, including men over 45 years old.

432
00:31:10.20 --> 00:31:16.20
The regiments were named after their old pre-versaille units and carried on their traditions.

433
00:31:16.20 --> 00:31:23.20
Only a few units were technically part of the armed forces, and the main function of the essay was to provide continuous and effective military training

434
00:31:23.20 --> 00:31:29.20
for a large mass of civilian populace outside the regular two-year service conscripts in the regular army.

435
00:31:29.20 --> 00:31:38.20
By 1939, the essay had been organized to provide specialist training in such lines as cavalry, signaling, engineers, medical service, and navy.

436
00:31:38.20 --> 00:31:51.20
One of its important jobs was given to military training of men over 21 who had not received any training in the pre-Hitler years when Germany's army had been restricted to a small standing army.

437
00:31:51.20 --> 00:32:01.20
The essay gave a coveted sports medal on a basis which shows how very well everything in their program was pointed toward military service.

438
00:32:01.20 --> 00:32:16.20
The examinations for this medal include, aside from running and swimming tests, rifle shooting, camouflage, hand grenade throwing, marching 25 kilometers with a 25-pound pack, and a 200-meter dash in gas mask, etc.

439
00:32:16.20 --> 00:32:25.20
By 1939, this sports medal had been acquired by 800,000 men outside the essay ranks.

440
00:32:25.20 --> 00:32:29.20
This is total war and we're all, that's what we're doing.

441
00:32:29.20 --> 00:32:42.20
It's crazy to think as you watch World War II unfold that Hitler was able to push as hard as he did and get away with as much as he did without somebody going, hey, bro, you're done.

442
00:32:42.20 --> 00:32:45.20
You can't do this anymore.

443
00:32:45.20 --> 00:33:00.20
An important aspect of the essay, an important aspect of the essay control of reservists was the fact that all these men would remain completely under the influence of the Nazi Party and doctrine and controls.

444
00:33:00.20 --> 00:33:10.20
Conclusion, with the approach of war, the essay members were largely called into the regular armed forces as individuals rather than by units.

445
00:33:10.20 --> 00:33:16.20
Enough of the leaders remained, however, to continue to work with the Hitler Youth and with other older civilians not yet called out.

446
00:33:16.20 --> 00:33:24.20
According to one estimate, 1,500,000 men were receiving essay training largely on Sundays and evenings in the spring of 1940.

447
00:33:24.20 --> 00:33:34.20
The work done by the essay provided a great mass of partially trained men in all age groups who could be quickly organized and used in regular divisions on the outbreak of war.

448
00:33:34.20 --> 00:33:41.20
A large part of the German military training had been accomplished with men who were technically in civilian status.

449
00:33:41.20 --> 00:33:45.20
As a result, a German division during the war could be sent into combat with a minimum of training.

450
00:33:45.20 --> 00:33:55.20
They're just focused on this one thing and they knew it was coming.

451
00:33:55.20 --> 00:34:01.20
And it's strange to think that the rest of the world knew it was coming.

452
00:34:01.20 --> 00:34:13.20
You can go back and look at those old political cartoons and you'll see all the political cartoons are showing Hitler and Germany just getting ready to go ham.

453
00:34:13.20 --> 00:34:16.20
This is a very interesting section here.

454
00:34:16.20 --> 00:34:21.20
Procurement and training of officers.

455
00:34:21.20 --> 00:34:34.20
When preparing for the large army used in his war of conquest, Hitler faced the serious problem of developing an adequate number of trained officers to operate 300 or more divisions and the various specialized corps and services.

456
00:34:34.20 --> 00:34:40.20
This problem was solved in large part between 1933 and the beginning of the war.

457
00:34:40.20 --> 00:34:50.20
One advantage at the start was that the small standing army permitted by Germany by the Versailles Treaty had been excellently trained.

458
00:34:50.20 --> 00:34:57.20
In World War I, Germany wasn't allowed to have a big army, they were allowed to have this tiny army and so they focused on that army really hard and got them very well trained.

459
00:34:57.20 --> 00:35:07.20
Also, they had preserved the best traditions of the old German army and constituted a valuable reservoir of officer material for the rapid expansion of the new army.

460
00:35:07.20 --> 00:35:13.20
In addition, there were available many thousands of men who had served in the First World War and who could be used again.

461
00:35:13.20 --> 00:35:17.20
Many of these took part in the essay training activities discussed earlier.

462
00:35:17.20 --> 00:35:25.20
Finally, the German general staff maintained its high standards and prestige and was ready to deal with this problem of officer procurement.

463
00:35:25.20 --> 00:35:32.20
So they knew out of the gate that leadership was going to be an issue and that they were going to have to field good officers.

464
00:35:32.20 --> 00:35:38.20
And how do you do that? You need to recruit the right officers and then you need to train them properly.

465
00:35:38.20 --> 00:35:51.20
Officer training prior to the war, the program of training which produced most of the regular army officers in this period throws light on the character of the army, its relation to the pre-Hitler army and the high quality of standards prescribed for officers.

466
00:35:51.20 --> 00:35:59.20
The civilian youth wishing to secure admission applied to the particular regiment or unit of his choice.

467
00:35:59.20 --> 00:36:03.20
So if you want to be an officer, you got to apply to a specific unit.

468
00:36:03.20 --> 00:36:16.20
Hey, I want to be an officer. He must be unmarried, be an Aryan and have a certificate of graduation from a gymnasium which is apparently the equivalent to a second year US college work.

469
00:36:16.20 --> 00:36:26.20
He was given interviews by an examining board of officers and examinations which tested his moral qualities and his ability to stand up under strain.

470
00:36:26.20 --> 00:36:30.20
Much importance was attached to a psychological test.

471
00:36:30.20 --> 00:36:39.20
After passing these examinations, the candidate, now a cadet, served for one year in the ranks of the unit which received him.

472
00:36:39.20 --> 00:36:45.20
So that's pretty cool. So you apply, they screen you, they test you, they see how you respond to pressure.

473
00:36:45.20 --> 00:36:53.20
If they accept you, you go in and you become one of the troops. You don't become an officer, you just become one of the troops and you serve in the ranks.

474
00:36:53.20 --> 00:36:57.20
There he received the same training given ordinary recruits and enjoyed no favors.

475
00:36:57.20 --> 00:37:06.20
It was desired that the cadets should thereby learn to understand the mental attitudes, problems and points of view of the common soldier.

476
00:37:06.20 --> 00:37:12.20
On the side and in addition to regular training, the cadets did special study on the use of weapons.

477
00:37:12.20 --> 00:37:18.20
After this year, so after a year of that, so you go in, you're going to be a normal trooper.

478
00:37:18.20 --> 00:37:27.20
After this year, the cadets were sent to a military school for nine months and received basic training and military theory identical for all branches of the service.

479
00:37:27.20 --> 00:37:37.20
So that's pretty good move. You take everybody from the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, you put them all through the same training so they all have a baseline of knowledge and understanding.

480
00:37:37.20 --> 00:37:47.20
There were four such schools admirably equipped without regard to expense. The course included field exercises, about 2,500 officers a year could be turned out in these schools.

481
00:37:47.20 --> 00:37:55.20
After these nine months, the cadets went to a weapons school destined to bring the candidates back to earth from their theoretical courses.

482
00:37:55.20 --> 00:38:02.20
Here they received training appropriate for their particular branch and an opportunity to command and train units attached to the school.

483
00:38:02.20 --> 00:38:17.20
Finally, the cadet performed two or three months tour of duty back with his regiment and then if elected by unanimous vote of the officers in his unit, he was received for promotion as a second lieutenant.

484
00:38:17.20 --> 00:38:29.20
This method, which bears the hallmark of the old Prussian aristocratic tradition, was modified gradually by provisions which made it more possible for reserve officers and specially qualified NCOs to obtain commissions.

485
00:38:29.20 --> 00:38:38.20
That is a thorough screening process to get to be an officer in the military.

486
00:38:38.20 --> 00:38:52.20
I mean you come back from all that training and then they have to have a unanimous vote that you're good to go and only then do you become a second lieutenant.

487
00:38:52.20 --> 00:39:01.20
He said that there's the hallmark of the old Prussian aristocratic tradition. That seems a lot less aristocratic than the American system.

488
00:39:01.20 --> 00:39:04.20
The American system, you become an officer to go to college.

489
00:39:04.20 --> 00:39:11.20
So if you're my, if Echo is my kid and I'm like, well, you know, I kind of want you to be in charge. I'm going to send you to college and then you can go be an officer.

490
00:39:11.20 --> 00:39:20.20
Here you got to apply, then you got to get screened, then you got to serve as a grunt, then you got to get screened again, then you got to go to this school for nine months,

491
00:39:20.20 --> 00:39:25.20
then you got to come and get voted on to see if you're going to be an officer or not.

492
00:39:25.20 --> 00:39:33.20
What do you think that's based on the American way to do it, like where you have to go to college first? Like, do you know what the basis for that was?

493
00:39:33.20 --> 00:39:42.20
Yes, it's an aristocratic thing. I want, oh, I'm a rich aristocrat. I want my son Echo to be a leader. I don't want him being with the troops.

494
00:39:42.20 --> 00:39:49.20
I don't want him to be with the elisted swine. No, so I'm going to send him to college and then he becomes an officer.

495
00:39:49.20 --> 00:39:58.20
Yeah, but then why is that the criteria though? I mean, maybe on the surface you can kind of tell because like, well, if you go to college, that means you're obviously smart.

496
00:39:58.20 --> 00:40:04.20
Therefore, an officer as a leader has to be smart or something kind of a thing. That's what it feels like anyway.

497
00:40:04.20 --> 00:40:10.20
That's probably conceptually, but that has nothing to do with anything.

498
00:40:10.20 --> 00:40:13.20
Yeah, the reality.

499
00:40:13.20 --> 00:40:15.20
Yeah, but it's so okay.

500
00:40:15.20 --> 00:40:24.20
There are brilliant enlisted guys. Yeah, that's what I think grew up in Wisconsin on a farm and they did parents didn't have any money to send to college.

501
00:40:24.20 --> 00:40:26.20
So he enlisted the army. Yeah. So what?

502
00:40:26.20 --> 00:40:38.20
Now he might eventually become an officer. He might put in for his commission or whatever, but he's already he's not going to be caught up to the guy that was grew up in with a rich family.

503
00:40:38.20 --> 00:40:41.20
That was like, listen, son, you're going to college and you're going to be an officer.

504
00:40:41.20 --> 00:40:45.20
Yeah. So how is that the criteria? Like, why did that come about that?

505
00:40:45.20 --> 00:40:52.20
That's why I'm laughing because they're saying this is like the aristocratic tradition.

506
00:40:52.20 --> 00:40:59.20
I'm like, hey, if you're whoever wrote this in 1942, the officers were aristocratic tradition in America 100%.

507
00:40:59.20 --> 00:41:01.20
It's an aristocratic tradition. Oh, well, you've been to college.

508
00:41:01.20 --> 00:41:04.20
So then you get to be in charge of all these people that haven't been to college.

509
00:41:04.20 --> 00:41:05.20
Right. Because you're a higher class.

510
00:41:05.20 --> 00:41:08.20
Because you're a higher class. You're an aristocrat. They're not.

511
00:41:08.20 --> 00:41:12.20
Yeah. Kind of when you think about it, especially that part about voting them in.

512
00:41:12.20 --> 00:41:15.20
Oh, yeah. Like that's kind of like and making them a grunt.

513
00:41:15.20 --> 00:41:24.20
Now, look, if you go to the Naval Academy or you go to West Point, you spend like the summer on a ship as like a swabby. Right.

514
00:41:24.20 --> 00:41:28.20
But that's not the same as doing a year in a line unit.

515
00:41:28.20 --> 00:41:33.20
It's not the same, dude. And that you have to do that in order to get recommended.

516
00:41:33.20 --> 00:41:41.20
Because there's a lot of officers, if they actually spent time as a grunt, people would be like, oh, this guy, this guy, this guy got what it takes.

517
00:41:41.20 --> 00:41:49.20
He might be able to graduate college. Being able to graduate college has almost no bearing on being fit to lead troops in combat.

518
00:41:49.20 --> 00:42:01.20
Yeah, that's kind of what I figured. So in a way, and obviously, I don't know, obviously, but in a way, this way that they're talking about kind of seems like more accurate.

519
00:42:01.20 --> 00:42:04.20
It seems like a better system. Yes, it does.

520
00:42:04.20 --> 00:42:10.20
So they got to go through like kind of more, more applicable stuff to achieve and get get get.

521
00:42:10.20 --> 00:42:19.20
You put somebody with a line unit where even if they're a machine gunner, they're machine, they spend six months as a machine gunner, they may then become a fire team leader.

522
00:42:19.20 --> 00:42:22.20
That person, you'd be able to go, hey, this guy's a really good fire team leader.

523
00:42:22.20 --> 00:42:26.20
He should, yeah, he should make it into this go to the officer school.

524
00:42:26.20 --> 00:42:32.20
But if he's a dud, yeah, as a fire team leader, he's not going to be a good squad leader.

525
00:42:32.20 --> 00:42:43.20
He's not going to be a good platoon leader. Yeah, which kind of and which seems like that just because you go to college, it wouldn't necessarily screen any duds out.

526
00:42:43.20 --> 00:42:47.20
It's going to screen zero duds or close to zero. Yeah.

527
00:42:47.20 --> 00:42:54.20
And then at the end, as a final, I'm assuming screening scenario, you gotta get voted on. Yeah.

528
00:42:54.20 --> 00:42:58.20
If somehow you maneuvered your way through this and that. After you spend two or three months there.

529
00:42:58.20 --> 00:43:02.20
What do you think you're going to go through in those two or three months? I'm going to be testing you.

530
00:43:02.20 --> 00:43:05.20
Like if I'm one of the other officers, I'm going to be like, all right, let's see how you're doing.

531
00:43:05.20 --> 00:43:10.20
Here, run a raid on this on this training mission. Let's see how you do, bro.

532
00:43:10.20 --> 00:43:16.20
And when it, because like, you know how there's kind of like survivor, remember, you know, that show, survivor on TV or whatever.

533
00:43:16.20 --> 00:43:23.20
It's kind of like that. It's like the final, the final judgment where it's like, you can maneuver your way through stuff and whatever.

534
00:43:23.20 --> 00:43:29.20
But if they, at the end of the day, don't want you to win or be on the team or be an officer, be whatever.

535
00:43:29.20 --> 00:43:36.20
If your team does not want that. That show is kind of messed up the way the, I think it was an unintended consequence of the show.

536
00:43:36.20 --> 00:43:44.20
Was that, you know, if who the people that got would get crushed first would be the people that had the, the, the most potential.

537
00:43:44.20 --> 00:43:47.20
Yeah. You remember that? Yeah. You know, yeah, you're, I think you're right.

538
00:43:47.20 --> 00:43:50.20
Unintended consequences. Unintended consequences. Yeah.

539
00:43:50.20 --> 00:43:55.20
But it did kind of lead to the natural evolution of the game, game, like where.

540
00:43:55.20 --> 00:44:03.20
Yeah. There was more game to it. Yeah. Cause it's like the game with the game. Yeah. Yeah. And that's really what we could say.

541
00:44:03.20 --> 00:44:08.20
Cause, cause you might be like, Hey, look, what they had challenges, right? Two teams and here's the challenge.

542
00:44:08.20 --> 00:44:15.20
And your thought should be, Hey, I'm going to help the team win this challenge because I'm good at rope climbs, right?

543
00:44:15.20 --> 00:44:22.20
Hey, I'll, we got to do four rope climbs. I'll do three of them. And, and, and then, you know, someone do the last one cause I'm going to be tired.

544
00:44:22.20 --> 00:44:26.20
Okay, cool. Let's get rid of Jaco. He's too strong. Yeah. You know what I'm saying?

545
00:44:26.20 --> 00:44:34.20
So that's actually what happened on that TV show. Oh yeah. So, and I, the weird thing is I actually don't watch that much, but I've watched enough to be like.

546
00:44:34.20 --> 00:44:42.20
I just remember like one, one season of it. I think the first season that came on or maybe the second season, the first season had Rudy Bosch on it.

547
00:44:42.20 --> 00:44:53.20
Who's like a, a, a epic seal. And you know, one of the most respected, awesome old school seals. And he was, and he was pretty old when he did it.

548
00:44:53.20 --> 00:45:00.20
He unfortunately passed away, but just a, so, you know, everyone kind of was watching like, see, see what the show was about.

549
00:45:00.20 --> 00:45:03.20
Yeah. Actually, one season, one of the girls from here, from Victor, who was on there.

550
00:45:03.20 --> 00:45:04.20
Really?

551
00:45:04.20 --> 00:45:06.20
We have one of the Kara K.

552
00:45:06.20 --> 00:45:07.20
Okay.

553
00:45:07.20 --> 00:45:08.20
Pretty sure those survived.

554
00:45:08.20 --> 00:45:09.20
Right on. How'd you do?

555
00:45:09.20 --> 00:45:16.20
I don't know. I forget. I didn't watch it, but I watched like some of them. You know, I don't know who won though, but yeah, we'll survive.

556
00:45:16.20 --> 00:45:17.20
So why are you talking about this again?

557
00:45:17.20 --> 00:45:22.20
Because at the end, they got the council. So that council scenario.

558
00:45:22.20 --> 00:45:23.20
Oh, so you got a base.

559
00:45:23.20 --> 00:45:28.20
So if you were a total backstabber, backstabber, then the council would vote you out.

560
00:45:28.20 --> 00:45:35.20
That's only one reason though. That's only one reason. So, or like, if you were hard to get along with somewhere along the lines, they would vote you off because of that.

561
00:45:35.20 --> 00:45:41.20
But somewhere along the lines, they would utilize those things too. So basically it gave rise to like this game within the game.

562
00:45:41.20 --> 00:45:46.20
Just like how you said, where you being strong at challenges is an element.

563
00:45:46.20 --> 00:45:50.20
It can be used for your advantage or against you, you know, kind of a thing.

564
00:45:50.20 --> 00:45:54.20
And that goes for every quality that each individual demonstrates.

565
00:45:54.20 --> 00:46:00.20
So the thing about survivor, unfortunately, it's like a winner take all kind of the thing at the end where they just get money.

566
00:46:00.20 --> 00:46:02.20
One guy, actually two people, but

567
00:46:02.20 --> 00:46:06.20
Did anyone ever make deals to say like, hey, if you and I win, I'll give you half?

568
00:46:06.20 --> 00:46:15.20
I don't know of any, but if that were to happen, that wouldn't surprise me because it's all within the game, you know, because I think at the end to or towards the end,

569
00:46:15.20 --> 00:46:16.20
How much did they win? A million?

570
00:46:16.20 --> 00:46:23.20
I think one million dollars. And then the second guy, second place got way less but a significant amount as well.

571
00:46:23.20 --> 00:46:34.20
But it at the end of it to or towards the end, they would, if you got voted off, it's like at the last four or five or however many people, if you get voted off,

572
00:46:34.20 --> 00:46:40.20
You get to go on to this council that has a say in who's going to win or something like that.

573
00:46:40.20 --> 00:46:49.20
So see how that weird balance kind of is where it's like, you get voted off, you better be squared away, you better be a good person, you better be whatever, you know.

574
00:46:49.20 --> 00:46:56.20
So it's like the final, you know, thing where it's like, yeah, you could be good at this, this and this, but if you don't have at the end of the day,

575
00:46:56.20 --> 00:47:01.20
Enough of what it takes that we think everyone else in the group within the group thinks, but you ain't going to make it.

576
00:47:01.20 --> 00:47:03.20
I don't care what, how cool you think you are.

577
00:47:03.20 --> 00:47:14.20
Yeah, it's good to have multiple assessments, which is the program that we're looking at right here with the Nazis data, multiple assessments in the actual environment where you need to step up.

578
00:47:14.20 --> 00:47:17.20
And you're going to get a decent result.

579
00:47:17.20 --> 00:47:24.20
More decent than said, well, you know, Fred went to college, so he should be in charge of a platoon of soldiers.

580
00:47:24.20 --> 00:47:28.20
You know, hey, look, there's some great officers.

581
00:47:28.20 --> 00:47:29.20
Yeah.

582
00:47:29.20 --> 00:47:33.20
The interesting thing about this is great officers that went to the academies.

583
00:47:33.20 --> 00:47:35.20
There's great officers that went to ROTC.

584
00:47:35.20 --> 00:47:37.20
There's great officers that went to OCS.

585
00:47:37.20 --> 00:47:40.20
There's horrible officers that went to the academies.

586
00:47:40.20 --> 00:47:42.20
There's horrible officers that went to OCS.

587
00:47:42.20 --> 00:47:45.20
There's horrible officers that did ROTC.

588
00:47:45.20 --> 00:47:52.20
And it kind of surprised me when I first worked with military academy officers.

589
00:47:52.20 --> 00:47:57.20
I thought to myself, hey, these guys have been training for four years to be leaders.

590
00:47:57.20 --> 00:48:00.20
Like this guy is going to be awesome.

591
00:48:00.20 --> 00:48:02.20
That was not always the case.

592
00:48:02.20 --> 00:48:07.20
And I realized that it was more about that you could have some awesome officers that went to the academies.

593
00:48:07.20 --> 00:48:09.20
You could have some terrible ones.

594
00:48:09.20 --> 00:48:12.20
And you could have all, you know, it didn't matter where they were from.

595
00:48:12.20 --> 00:48:14.20
It was who they were as people.

596
00:48:14.20 --> 00:48:16.20
That was what was much more important.

597
00:48:16.20 --> 00:48:17.20
Yeah.

598
00:48:17.20 --> 00:48:19.20
So when you went to cut, because you went after, right?

599
00:48:19.20 --> 00:48:20.20
Yeah.

600
00:48:20.20 --> 00:48:27.20
So when you went to college, do you think that that college experience helped you in your officer position?

601
00:48:27.20 --> 00:48:30.20
It helped me because I became a better writer and reader.

602
00:48:30.20 --> 00:48:32.20
Like I was an English major.

603
00:48:32.20 --> 00:48:40.20
And I remember reading like directives and rows of engagement.

604
00:48:40.20 --> 00:48:44.20
And not that I knew how to read them so that I would understand them better.

605
00:48:44.20 --> 00:48:46.20
And I got that from having to read Shakespeare, bro.

606
00:48:46.20 --> 00:48:47.20
I hate to say it.

607
00:48:47.20 --> 00:48:52.20
I know it sounds like freaking stupid, but when you read Shakespeare, you have to look up the words.

608
00:48:52.20 --> 00:48:53.20
You have to see what the context is.

609
00:48:53.20 --> 00:48:58.20
And I realized if when I, before I went to college, I'd be like, I don't know what that means, but whatever.

610
00:48:58.20 --> 00:49:00.20
I get the gist, right?

611
00:49:00.20 --> 00:49:02.20
And that did the, getting the gist doesn't cut it.

612
00:49:02.20 --> 00:49:08.20
And then I realized also writing a report or writing an award or writing an evaluation.

613
00:49:08.20 --> 00:49:09.20
Same thing.

614
00:49:09.20 --> 00:49:10.20
I'm like, you will, he'll know what I mean.

615
00:49:10.20 --> 00:49:14.20
No, I'm going to make sure that my boss understands what this means.

616
00:49:14.20 --> 00:49:16.20
And you think that college taught you that 100%.

617
00:49:16.20 --> 00:49:21.20
I mean, dude, I was one time I took five English classes in one semester.

618
00:49:21.20 --> 00:49:23.20
That was ignorant, bro.

619
00:49:23.20 --> 00:49:25.20
That was one of the dumbest things I've done.

620
00:49:25.20 --> 00:49:27.20
Because I was just reading.

621
00:49:27.20 --> 00:49:32.20
I was reading and writing just like 10, 12 hours a day on the weekends.

622
00:49:32.20 --> 00:49:34.20
I remember just reading books.

623
00:49:34.20 --> 00:49:35.20
It was ridiculous.

624
00:49:35.20 --> 00:49:36.20
Yeah.

625
00:49:36.20 --> 00:49:38.20
And I took this one class.

626
00:49:38.20 --> 00:49:40.20
I was like, oh, this would be good.

627
00:49:40.20 --> 00:49:42.20
Like nice little skater class, little skate class.

628
00:49:42.20 --> 00:49:45.20
It was literature and film.

629
00:49:45.20 --> 00:49:46.20
Cool.

630
00:49:46.20 --> 00:49:47.20
Well, watch, right?

631
00:49:47.20 --> 00:49:49.20
So you got lured right into it just like I did.

632
00:49:49.20 --> 00:49:53.20
It was like you spend all, you know, you got to read the book.

633
00:49:53.20 --> 00:49:56.20
And then they get, then you watch a movie that they made from the book.

634
00:49:56.20 --> 00:49:57.20
Oh yeah.

635
00:49:57.20 --> 00:49:58.20
But watching the movie takes an hour.

636
00:49:58.20 --> 00:50:01.20
But you still spent 12 hours reading this freaking God forsaken book.

637
00:50:01.20 --> 00:50:02.20
Oh yeah, especially.

638
00:50:02.20 --> 00:50:04.20
So it wasn't, it wasn't good.

639
00:50:04.20 --> 00:50:05.20
I understand.

640
00:50:05.20 --> 00:50:06.20
It bothered me.

641
00:50:06.20 --> 00:50:08.20
I think it was a good tip right there, by the way.

642
00:50:08.20 --> 00:50:12.20
Because in theory, you take all English, you're like, shit, I'll have to think about anatomy

643
00:50:12.20 --> 00:50:14.20
or if you can fit whatever else class.

644
00:50:14.20 --> 00:50:15.20
I don't think about that.

645
00:50:15.20 --> 00:50:18.20
I just think about English or literature, whatever we're doing.

646
00:50:18.20 --> 00:50:19.20
No, no, no.

647
00:50:19.20 --> 00:50:20.20
Check this out.

648
00:50:20.20 --> 00:50:23.20
There's a book called Tom Jones, which is an outstanding book.

649
00:50:23.20 --> 00:50:25.20
It's an amazing book.

650
00:50:25.20 --> 00:50:32.20
It's probably 700 pages long with tiny, tiny, tiny writing and paper thin little sheets of

651
00:50:32.20 --> 00:50:33.20
paper.

652
00:50:33.20 --> 00:50:35.20
And it's really descriptive.

653
00:50:35.20 --> 00:50:37.20
And it's about human nature.

654
00:50:37.20 --> 00:50:41.20
And it tells this story, elaborate story with all these different characters.

655
00:50:41.20 --> 00:50:45.20
And so we read this book and then we watched the movie.

656
00:50:45.20 --> 00:50:48.20
In the movie, there's no talking.

657
00:50:48.20 --> 00:50:50.20
The whole movie's no talking.

658
00:50:50.20 --> 00:50:51.20
They're just acting.

659
00:50:51.20 --> 00:50:53.20
They're just doing things.

660
00:50:53.20 --> 00:50:59.20
It was like, just picture any book.

661
00:50:59.20 --> 00:51:03.20
Picture any book that you've ever read and there's no, and then you take that.

662
00:51:03.20 --> 00:51:05.20
I mean, just what's it like?

663
00:51:05.20 --> 00:51:07.20
Take picture of Tom Clancy.

664
00:51:07.20 --> 00:51:08.20
Have you ever read?

665
00:51:08.20 --> 00:51:10.20
What's a movie that was a book that you like?

666
00:51:10.20 --> 00:51:11.20
A movie.

667
00:51:11.20 --> 00:51:13.20
That was a book that I like.

668
00:51:13.20 --> 00:51:14.20
Flight Club.

669
00:51:14.20 --> 00:51:15.20
Okay.

670
00:51:15.20 --> 00:51:18.20
So picture Flight Club, they take that book and they make a movie and there's no talking

671
00:51:18.20 --> 00:51:20.20
in it because that's literally what they did.

672
00:51:20.20 --> 00:51:21.20
I see what they're doing though.

673
00:51:21.20 --> 00:51:22.20
Yeah.

674
00:51:22.20 --> 00:51:23.20
I know why they assigned that.

675
00:51:23.20 --> 00:51:24.20
Yeah.

676
00:51:24.20 --> 00:51:25.20
No, it was cool.

677
00:51:25.20 --> 00:51:26.20
It was cool.

678
00:51:26.20 --> 00:51:29.20
It was very cool to watch how they did it and just see the interactions and you could,

679
00:51:29.20 --> 00:51:32.20
you could totally tell what was going on just by the way they were looking at each

680
00:51:32.20 --> 00:51:35.20
other and they carried themselves, their body language, all this stuff.

681
00:51:35.20 --> 00:51:38.20
And it was pretty amazing to watch.

682
00:51:38.20 --> 00:51:39.20
For real.

683
00:51:39.20 --> 00:51:40.20
But guess what?

684
00:51:40.20 --> 00:51:43.20
Still had to read that freaking book.

685
00:51:43.20 --> 00:51:50.20
Still had to read that book and it bothered me because, because I would always read everything

686
00:51:50.20 --> 00:51:52.20
that I was told to read, right?

687
00:51:52.20 --> 00:51:56.20
I think I might be the only person in college that has ever done that.

688
00:51:56.20 --> 00:51:57.20
Personal challenge.

689
00:51:57.20 --> 00:52:02.20
And I would get like, give us a quiz to check to make sure you read, you did the reading.

690
00:52:02.20 --> 00:52:06.20
So they give you a little check and the check is, these are just questions, but you know,

691
00:52:06.20 --> 00:52:08.20
if you read it, you're going to know.

692
00:52:08.20 --> 00:52:13.20
And I missed the first, the first quiz about Tom Jones.

693
00:52:13.20 --> 00:52:18.20
I missed, I missed one question and I was so mad.

694
00:52:18.20 --> 00:52:23.20
And here's what made me mad is that it said, this is a book, it says basically this is a

695
00:52:23.20 --> 00:52:26.20
book about human nature.

696
00:52:26.20 --> 00:52:30.20
And the question was like, what is the, or it said like the main theme of this book is

697
00:52:30.20 --> 00:52:31.20
human nature.

698
00:52:31.20 --> 00:52:35.20
And so the question on the test was, hey, what is the main theme in this book?

699
00:52:35.20 --> 00:52:39.20
And I put like the kind of the plot that was starting to unfold, but that was wrong.

700
00:52:39.20 --> 00:52:41.20
And I was bummed out, missed it.

701
00:52:41.20 --> 00:52:43.20
That's the one question I missed in that class.

702
00:52:43.20 --> 00:52:44.20
You're still mad about it.

703
00:52:44.20 --> 00:52:45.20
I'm still mad, obviously.

704
00:52:45.20 --> 00:52:46.20
I'm sitting here.

705
00:52:46.20 --> 00:52:47.20
What's that?

706
00:52:47.20 --> 00:52:50.20
What's the word, what's the word they use now to describe a little bit mad salty?

707
00:52:50.20 --> 00:52:52.20
I'm a little bit salty about that.

708
00:52:52.20 --> 00:52:58.20
So, okay, so when you go to college, I think I went to the professor too.

709
00:52:58.20 --> 00:53:00.20
And I was like, hey, what, you marked this wrong?

710
00:53:00.20 --> 00:53:01.20
You contested it.

711
00:53:01.20 --> 00:53:02.20
Yeah.

712
00:53:02.20 --> 00:53:04.20
And actually that professor was really cool.

713
00:53:04.20 --> 00:53:05.20
She was cool.

714
00:53:05.20 --> 00:53:09.20
And I had had another class when I was like, hey, you know, doctor, you know, you mark

715
00:53:09.20 --> 00:53:13.20
this wrong, just want to, you know, just show you that you accidentally marked this wrong,

716
00:53:13.20 --> 00:53:14.20
obviously.

717
00:53:14.20 --> 00:53:17.20
And she was like, no, it's a book of the theme of human nature.

718
00:53:17.20 --> 00:53:18.20
And I was like, well, where are you getting that from?

719
00:53:18.20 --> 00:53:21.20
And she points to the sentence that literally says that.

720
00:53:21.20 --> 00:53:24.20
And I was like, cool, I won't miss another question this semester.

721
00:53:24.20 --> 00:53:29.20
She said, I know John, because they all called me just the only place in the world.

722
00:53:29.20 --> 00:53:36.20
That group of people called me John was when I went to college because it was on my, what

723
00:53:36.20 --> 00:53:37.20
is it?

724
00:53:37.20 --> 00:53:41.20
The, what's the role called called in the college attendance sheet or whatever.

725
00:53:41.20 --> 00:53:43.000
So then my name was John.

726
00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:44.20
And they'd be like, John, yes.

727
00:53:44.20 --> 00:53:45.20
Seems to make sense.

728
00:53:45.20 --> 00:53:46.20
I was like, well, you can call me John.

729
00:53:46.20 --> 00:53:47.20
I didn't know that's not my thing.

730
00:53:47.20 --> 00:53:48.20
That's not my thing.

731
00:53:48.20 --> 00:53:49.20
Yeah.

732
00:53:49.20 --> 00:53:50.20
Yeah.

733
00:53:50.20 --> 00:53:51.20
I dig it.

734
00:53:51.20 --> 00:53:52.20
I dig it fully.

735
00:53:52.20 --> 00:53:53.20
So it is.

736
00:53:53.20 --> 00:53:56.20
So when you go to college for, let's say your situation, I'm seeing those scenarios, but

737
00:53:56.20 --> 00:54:01.20
your situation you enlisted, boom, time to go to the officer program.

738
00:54:01.20 --> 00:54:03.20
I went to officer can at school.

739
00:54:03.20 --> 00:54:05.20
And then do you go to college after that?

740
00:54:05.20 --> 00:54:06.20
I did.

741
00:54:06.20 --> 00:54:08.20
I happened to go to college afterwards.

742
00:54:08.20 --> 00:54:09.20
My, my program was very strange.

743
00:54:09.20 --> 00:54:10.20
Okay.

744
00:54:10.20 --> 00:54:12.20
So let's say whatever the protocol is, you go to college.

745
00:54:12.20 --> 00:54:16.20
Is there, are there like majors that you can and cannot take to fulfill?

746
00:54:16.20 --> 00:54:17.20
Yes, there are.

747
00:54:17.20 --> 00:54:19.20
I don't know what they are, but they're pretty.

748
00:54:19.20 --> 00:54:27.32
I mean, I don't think you could take like some totally crazy, unapplicable thing.

749
00:54:27.32 --> 00:54:30.20
But you can, I mean, I took English.

750
00:54:30.20 --> 00:54:31.20
Yeah.

751
00:54:31.20 --> 00:54:34.40
So that, I mean, but the English, it's, it feels like English would be like, if there

752
00:54:34.40 --> 00:54:40.20
was a list of majors that you could have, then the rest are unacceptable for this program.

753
00:54:40.20 --> 00:54:42.20
You think English would be on the list.

754
00:54:42.20 --> 00:54:46.000
It feels like it, but there were, there were.

755
00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:49.16
You definitely can't pick something that's like, I don't know.

756
00:54:49.16 --> 00:54:51.16
I don't think you could pick theater.

757
00:54:51.16 --> 00:54:52.16
Yeah.

758
00:54:52.16 --> 00:54:55.80
Like, cause they'd say, Hey, when, when actually, you know, you're going to be standing up

759
00:54:55.80 --> 00:54:57.16
and talking in front of people.

760
00:54:57.16 --> 00:54:59.16
You might want to get good at public speaking.

761
00:54:59.16 --> 00:55:00.16
Right.

762
00:55:00.16 --> 00:55:01.56
But I don't think you could take theater.

763
00:55:01.56 --> 00:55:07.16
I don't think, although I had one of my, one of my assistant platoon commanders.

764
00:55:07.16 --> 00:55:10.56
He was, you know, as a, as I was getting to know him, like, well, what did you study

765
00:55:10.56 --> 00:55:11.56
in college?

766
00:55:11.56 --> 00:55:14.08
You know what he studied in college?

767
00:55:14.08 --> 00:55:16.08
He studied percussion.

768
00:55:16.08 --> 00:55:17.08
The drum.

769
00:55:17.08 --> 00:55:18.08
Yeah.

770
00:55:18.08 --> 00:55:20.52
He, he, that's what his degree was in percussion.

771
00:55:20.52 --> 00:55:21.52
Yeah.

772
00:55:21.52 --> 00:55:24.96
I'm like, bro, this is not going to help you too much in the day.

773
00:55:24.96 --> 00:55:25.96
Yeah.

774
00:55:25.96 --> 00:55:31.12
Like, um, you know how people go hard with like French poetry or something like that?

775
00:55:31.12 --> 00:55:36.52
Where, I don't think you could get more useless than percussion.

776
00:55:36.52 --> 00:55:40.64
Even French poetry might be more useful than percussion.

777
00:55:40.64 --> 00:55:41.64
And I mean, he was awesome.

778
00:55:41.64 --> 00:55:44.56
We're freaking great guy, but was he good at drumming?

779
00:55:44.56 --> 00:55:45.56
Yeah.

780
00:55:45.56 --> 00:55:46.56
Hell yeah.

781
00:55:46.56 --> 00:55:47.56
Absolutely.

782
00:55:47.56 --> 00:55:48.56
All right.

783
00:55:48.56 --> 00:55:56.04
Um, so it seems like a very squared away methodology for them to, to select their officer.

784
00:55:56.04 --> 00:56:00.20
Now we get into the training with the approach of the war, the programs for officer training

785
00:56:00.20 --> 00:56:03.72
were enlarged and speeded up in 1940.

786
00:56:03.72 --> 00:56:08.000
U.S. observers estimated that schools were turning out about 6,500 officers every four

787
00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:14.000
months and that 30,000 new officers entered the army between September, 1939 and December,

788
00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:15.000
1940.

789
00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:17.36
Man, they are an explosive growth curve.

790
00:56:17.36 --> 00:56:21.04
And applying for the, for a commission in the regular army continued to undergo relatively

791
00:56:21.04 --> 00:56:26.76
long training course in principle as thorough as that of peacetime and quite similar in

792
00:56:26.76 --> 00:56:27.88
plan.

793
00:56:27.88 --> 00:56:34.32
Candidates for temporary war commissions apparently receive a shorter period of training, sometimes

794
00:56:34.32 --> 00:56:38.20
according to observers and reports for a few months only.

795
00:56:38.20 --> 00:56:42.72
All candidates for officer grades must have had 15 months of service and at least two

796
00:56:42.72 --> 00:56:47.72
months of experience in the field as a leader of a section or platoon.

797
00:56:47.72 --> 00:56:52.000
Although these standards ensure that candidates have had considerable background training,

798
00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:57.000
nevertheless expanding the German army to six times its peacetime figures has produced

799
00:56:57.000 --> 00:56:59.76
obvious problems.

800
00:56:59.76 --> 00:57:04.60
Many reserve officers and NCOs have been commissioned from the ranks and from veterans

801
00:57:04.60 --> 00:57:06.60
of the first world war.

802
00:57:06.60 --> 00:57:08.68
Civilians have been appointed to administrative posts.

803
00:57:08.68 --> 00:57:13.08
Regular officers and civilian specialists have been thus used to free the line officer

804
00:57:13.08 --> 00:57:17.64
for his main task, leadership of troops in combat.

805
00:57:17.64 --> 00:57:21.08
Attention has paid, been paid to the continuation training of officers in the field.

806
00:57:21.08 --> 00:57:27.08
So they had a way of taking, hey, like Echo Charles was a video guy in the civilian world

807
00:57:27.08 --> 00:57:30.24
and they're like, oh, you know what, you're going to become an officer, but you're going

808
00:57:30.24 --> 00:57:34.56
to be in charge of propaganda and you're going to go make videos for the third Reich.

809
00:57:34.56 --> 00:57:39.80
And meanwhile, Jaco, who is a sergeant in the army and was a platoon leader or a platoon

810
00:57:39.80 --> 00:57:42.88
sergeant in the army, we're going to make him an infantry officer.

811
00:57:42.88 --> 00:57:48.28
So they had a way of kind of putting people and utilizing the knowledge that they had

812
00:57:48.28 --> 00:57:54.40
in a way that's going to help the whole overall effort.

813
00:57:54.40 --> 00:57:57.40
Continuation training of officers, this has received a good deal of attention since the

814
00:57:57.40 --> 00:58:01.44
start of the war owing to the relatively short training received by many officers.

815
00:58:01.44 --> 00:58:05.76
The Germans are particularly concerned with the progressive training of company officers

816
00:58:05.76 --> 00:58:10.24
on whom depends the combat efficiency of the fighting units.

817
00:58:10.24 --> 00:58:15.44
One of the essential duties of a commanding officer in wartime is to ensure the further

818
00:58:15.44 --> 00:58:21.08
military education of his junior officers who must be made to realize that to stand

819
00:58:21.08 --> 00:58:26.84
still is to retrogress.

820
00:58:26.84 --> 00:58:27.84
Interesting word, retrogress.

821
00:58:27.84 --> 00:58:32.24
Yeah, yeah, it's like degress.

822
00:58:32.24 --> 00:58:34.36
This is so important.

823
00:58:34.36 --> 00:58:37.20
When you're in charge of people, you're in charge of training them and you're in charge

824
00:58:37.20 --> 00:58:38.68
of training your subordinate leaders.

825
00:58:38.68 --> 00:58:40.32
There's no training cadre.

826
00:58:40.32 --> 00:58:42.84
There's no big group up above you in the chain of command.

827
00:58:42.84 --> 00:58:44.20
You are in charge of it.

828
00:58:44.20 --> 00:58:45.20
And that's the same.

829
00:58:45.20 --> 00:58:46.20
It should be the same in any company.

830
00:58:46.20 --> 00:58:47.20
It should be the same in your life.

831
00:58:47.20 --> 00:58:48.20
You're in charge of it.

832
00:58:48.20 --> 00:58:50.20
Take charge of it.

833
00:58:50.20 --> 00:58:55.56
And then the main thing that they're trying to, they must be made to realize is that to

834
00:58:55.56 --> 00:58:58.80
stand still is to retrogress.

835
00:58:58.80 --> 00:59:00.40
That's what the Nazis were about.

836
00:59:00.40 --> 00:59:01.40
Blitzkrieg, right?

837
00:59:01.40 --> 00:59:02.40
We're moving.

838
00:59:02.40 --> 00:59:05.24
We're going to get after it.

839
00:59:05.24 --> 00:59:08.24
The concept of continuation training is broad.

840
00:59:08.24 --> 00:59:14.48
It involves a review of fundamentals with constant reference to the manual of troop leadership.

841
00:59:14.48 --> 00:59:16.64
It stresses the need for versatility.

842
00:59:16.64 --> 00:59:21.92
The infantry officer must familiarize himself with the capabilities of other arms than his

843
00:59:21.92 --> 00:59:22.92
own.

844
00:59:22.92 --> 00:59:26.84
While of all, the officer must prepare himself for emergency service in the next higher grade

845
00:59:26.84 --> 00:59:30.28
or for replacing comrades in other executive positions.

846
00:59:30.28 --> 00:59:34.60
It is the responsibility of senior officers to assist their juniors in training for the

847
00:59:34.60 --> 00:59:38.12
next higher grade.

848
00:59:38.12 --> 00:59:43.80
So they put such an emphasis on training their subordinate leadership.

849
00:59:43.80 --> 00:59:45.84
German sources illustrate these principles.

850
00:59:45.84 --> 00:59:51.12
In the first place, let us outline the requirements for the development of our officers.

851
00:59:51.12 --> 00:59:57.48
The strength of the German army has lain and still lies in the platoon commander at

852
00:59:57.48 --> 00:59:59.68
the front.

853
00:59:59.68 --> 01:00:05.000
This will remain so in the future and the example of our lieutenants as he stands and

854
01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:11.16
fights at the front cannot be emulated by any nation on earth according to a well known

855
01:00:11.16 --> 01:00:13.48
saying of Bismarck.

856
01:00:13.48 --> 01:00:17.84
Again, that's some good propaganda.

857
01:00:17.84 --> 01:00:21.08
You're telling these young lieutenants you're the one that's going to make a difference.

858
01:00:21.08 --> 01:00:30.24
It's like the Marine Corps Squad Leader makes a difference.

859
01:00:30.24 --> 01:00:35.000
One would misjudge the lieutenants mission entirely however if one would have him conform

860
01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:39.80
exclusively to the services of and requirements for a platoon commander.

861
01:00:39.80 --> 01:00:43.24
So it's not just platoon commander you're going to be, actual conditions require much

862
01:00:43.24 --> 01:00:46.36
more of the lieutenant than mere services such.

863
01:00:46.36 --> 01:00:52.60
Any lieutenant may at any time have to educate, train and lead a company, battery or other

864
01:00:52.60 --> 01:00:58.60
similar unit and any lieutenant may suddenly have to serve as a staff officer or even as

865
01:00:58.60 --> 01:01:02.32
an adjutant or aide to camp.

866
01:01:02.32 --> 01:01:06.88
The progressive training of the officer corps must be carried out with this eventuality

867
01:01:06.88 --> 01:01:07.88
in mind.

868
01:01:07.88 --> 01:01:11.20
So you're not just trained to be a platoon leader, you're trained to be a company commander,

869
01:01:11.20 --> 01:01:13.92
a battery commander, a staff officer.

870
01:01:13.92 --> 01:01:17.56
That's what you're trained to do everything.

871
01:01:17.56 --> 01:01:21.68
If the officer is ready to serve in several different capacities at a moment's notice

872
01:01:21.68 --> 01:01:26.80
he must be thoroughly indoctrinated in the fundamentals of tactics.

873
01:01:26.80 --> 01:01:30.000
This point emphasized in the German source just quoted.

874
01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:34.16
One difficulty is that a great many young officers have no knowledge of the fundamentals

875
01:01:34.16 --> 01:01:35.24
of tactics.

876
01:01:35.24 --> 01:01:40.04
Many dangerous mistakes arrive from this fact and during lessons there is often vague discussion

877
01:01:40.04 --> 01:01:42.12
because of a lack of understanding.

878
01:01:42.12 --> 01:01:45.68
Lack of indoctrination is the most serious defect.

879
01:01:45.68 --> 01:01:48.76
It results in many unnecessary commands.

880
01:01:48.76 --> 01:01:51.20
It results in many unnecessary commands.

881
01:01:51.20 --> 01:01:55.24
So if you don't know what you're doing you're going to make a bunch of unnecessary commands.

882
01:01:55.24 --> 01:02:00.40
One must insist therefore that thorough indoctrination of all officers regarding tactical principles

883
01:02:00.40 --> 01:02:02.000
is absolutely essential.

884
01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:06.28
Young officers must be thoroughly familiar with the tactics of all units up to and including

885
01:02:06.28 --> 01:02:07.64
the battalion.

886
01:02:07.64 --> 01:02:10.92
In this connection much work is needed.

887
01:02:10.92 --> 01:02:14.04
Younger officers must work to teach the younger ones.

888
01:02:14.04 --> 01:02:16.88
Must work hard to learn.

889
01:02:16.88 --> 01:02:21.24
It is an open question as to which task is most difficult but that is immaterial.

890
01:02:21.24 --> 01:02:26.40
The important thing is to attain clearly defined objective.

891
01:02:26.40 --> 01:02:31.52
The ideal desire here was summed up by a German officer in a conversation with an observer.

892
01:02:31.52 --> 01:02:34.40
We apply simple methods to our leadership.

893
01:02:34.40 --> 01:02:39.12
You will find that our lower units are so trained that many in them beside the leader

894
01:02:39.12 --> 01:02:43.28
is capable of taking command.

895
01:02:43.28 --> 01:02:45.16
So there you go.

896
01:02:45.16 --> 01:02:46.80
Keeping things simple.

897
01:02:46.80 --> 01:02:53.92
People there's multiple layers of leadership ready to take over when needed and we're training

898
01:02:53.92 --> 01:02:58.20
and indoctrinating them into the basic tactics so everyone knows and understands.

899
01:02:58.20 --> 01:02:59.52
Standards for officers.

900
01:02:59.52 --> 01:03:00.52
Section five.

901
01:03:00.52 --> 01:03:05.84
The German Army tradition set high standards for officers both as to character and as to

902
01:03:05.84 --> 01:03:07.16
professional ability.

903
01:03:07.16 --> 01:03:12.72
Great attention is paid to this subject in professional journals and books.

904
01:03:12.72 --> 01:03:15.84
Particular concern is shown for officers of company rank.

905
01:03:15.84 --> 01:03:19.84
This is partly because in a rapidly expanding army it was necessary to observe and integrate

906
01:03:19.84 --> 01:03:22.24
a large number of new officers at lower grades.

907
01:03:22.24 --> 01:03:27.20
But it is also due to conviction that efficiency and leadership standards of these officers

908
01:03:27.20 --> 01:03:31.48
are of crucial importance for the combat success of the army.

909
01:03:31.48 --> 01:03:38.52
These officers actually lead the units in the frontline combat.

910
01:03:38.52 --> 01:03:43.92
With this principle in mind the German general staff has followed a policy which is described

911
01:03:43.92 --> 01:03:46.72
very clearly by a U.S. observer.

912
01:03:46.72 --> 01:03:47.88
Quote.

913
01:03:47.88 --> 01:03:53.56
In the German Army leadership is emphasized more than general ship.

914
01:03:53.56 --> 01:04:01.08
The general officer must of course combine to an outstanding degree proved qualifications

915
01:04:01.08 --> 01:04:07.72
for field leadership, mental resiliency and executive capacity supported by unusual physical

916
01:04:07.72 --> 01:04:11.52
stamina and ruggedness of constitution.

917
01:04:11.52 --> 01:04:16.40
German general officers were selected on this basis prior to mobilization.

918
01:04:16.40 --> 01:04:22.84
They won their positions in the pre-war building training and equipping of the modern army.

919
01:04:22.84 --> 01:04:26.08
All of them have had world war experience.

920
01:04:26.08 --> 01:04:30.32
As far as we know none of them has been relieved from command during operations.

921
01:04:30.32 --> 01:04:35.20
The efficiency and ability of these German generals seems to be taken for granted.

922
01:04:35.20 --> 01:04:41.20
They have received practically no publicity during the war.

923
01:04:41.20 --> 01:04:47.96
Only one general, general of infantry, Edward Dietl, who commanded at Narvik, has been

924
01:04:47.96 --> 01:04:52.24
brought before the public for his accomplishments.

925
01:04:52.24 --> 01:04:57.72
This was not for his general ship, but for the qualities of leadership displayed in situations

926
01:04:57.72 --> 01:05:03.96
normally met with leaders lower in the command.

927
01:05:03.96 --> 01:05:07.96
So they're not even hyping up generals.

928
01:05:07.96 --> 01:05:10.28
And you could see this is probably an ego thing.

929
01:05:10.28 --> 01:05:13.04
You know like Hitler doesn't want generals getting any glory.

930
01:05:13.04 --> 01:05:15.84
He's like hey give the glory to the soldiers.

931
01:05:15.84 --> 01:05:18.28
And but we got one general that kind of acted like a badass.

932
01:05:18.28 --> 01:05:21.28
Okay we'll give him some credit but everybody else you're just doing your job.

933
01:05:21.28 --> 01:05:23.56
Give the glory to the troops.

934
01:05:23.56 --> 01:05:27.64
You think Hitler wanted competition?

935
01:05:27.64 --> 01:05:28.64
No.

936
01:05:28.64 --> 01:05:31.96
Okay so what's the strategy?

937
01:05:31.96 --> 01:05:38.80
According to your theory obviously I think that's what you're saying is that like okay

938
01:05:38.80 --> 01:05:45.48
so since the troops aren't really in competition for glory like the top guy so give them the

939
01:05:45.48 --> 01:05:50.76
glory give them you know kind of the credit and the props.

940
01:05:50.76 --> 01:05:56.32
So because generals essentially can be in competition with him.

941
01:05:56.32 --> 01:05:57.32
Might be competition for me.

942
01:05:57.32 --> 01:06:00.28
Like he looks at them as kind of a threat for the glory in a way.

943
01:06:00.28 --> 01:06:07.64
Like we go to a jujitsu tournament and you're a black belt and you win.

944
01:06:07.64 --> 01:06:12.04
But I'm like hey you know what good job you know Fred in the white belt category and on

945
01:06:12.04 --> 01:06:15.72
Monday I give a big speech and I give credit to all like the junior troops because you're

946
01:06:15.72 --> 01:06:18.44
kind of a threat and I'm like I'm not giving this guy any credit.

947
01:06:18.44 --> 01:06:19.76
You know what I'm saying?

948
01:06:19.76 --> 01:06:25.12
Yeah like yeah like some people like a general is high enough rank that he might kind of like

949
01:06:25.12 --> 01:06:29.28
supersede my glory because he's too close to my lane.

950
01:06:29.28 --> 01:06:30.28
Interesting.

951
01:06:30.28 --> 01:06:33.08
Didn't like that.

952
01:06:33.08 --> 01:06:37.56
He says on the contrary leaders in the lower command have received a great deal of publicity

953
01:06:37.56 --> 01:06:41.96
since the outbreak of the war so every young you know German soldier that does something

954
01:06:41.96 --> 01:06:44.56
awesome is getting this full blown credit.

955
01:06:44.56 --> 01:06:46.56
And by the way what was Hitler during World War I?

956
01:06:46.56 --> 01:06:48.48
He was a corporal.

957
01:06:48.48 --> 01:06:50.20
He was running around.

958
01:06:50.20 --> 01:06:51.20
He was a communicator.

959
01:06:51.20 --> 01:06:52.56
He was a runner.

960
01:06:52.56 --> 01:06:57.24
So he's giving credit to those guys.

961
01:06:57.24 --> 01:07:00.80
Another general principle underlying German training of officers is the view that good

962
01:07:00.80 --> 01:07:05.76
leaders can be developed for lower commands by carefully training for leadership is not

963
01:07:05.76 --> 01:07:09.76
confined to a few individuals gifted with superior qualities.

964
01:07:09.76 --> 01:07:14.000
However every effort is made to find the right place for each individual according to his

965
01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:18.28
special aptitudes and a good deal of shifting is done in order to accomplish this.

966
01:07:18.28 --> 01:07:21.20
So they take eyes and they go oh you know what you're not this you know what echo you

967
01:07:21.20 --> 01:07:25.92
might be want to be over here in the propaganda area because you're not good at making videos

968
01:07:25.92 --> 01:07:28.48
but we're not going to put you up there running troops.

969
01:07:28.48 --> 01:07:31.72
You're fain.

970
01:07:31.72 --> 01:07:35.12
A German officer in conversation accounted for his German military success in a way which

971
01:07:35.12 --> 01:07:39.92
brings out main standards of leadership prized in his army.

972
01:07:39.92 --> 01:07:41.28
And this is what this German officer says.

973
01:07:41.28 --> 01:07:45.48
I would say that the success of our leadership depends upon the selection of officers of

974
01:07:45.48 --> 01:07:50.44
improved character and skill and upon our system of learning each required task and

975
01:07:50.44 --> 01:07:54.48
maneuver to perfection by repeated process.

976
01:07:54.48 --> 01:08:02.64
One can only learn by doing the proverb we see the east mocked.

977
01:08:02.64 --> 01:08:06.08
Knowledge is power is in truth not accurate.

978
01:08:06.08 --> 01:08:13.56
Knowledge becomes power only when it is being successfully applied in the gaining of an objective.

979
01:08:13.56 --> 01:08:18.92
So just because you know something doesn't mean anything.

980
01:08:18.92 --> 01:08:20.24
And then they talk about character.

981
01:08:20.24 --> 01:08:25.92
And again it's very strange to be reading a book about freaking Nazis and talk about

982
01:08:25.92 --> 01:08:26.92
their character.

983
01:08:26.92 --> 01:08:31.32
And you know all that being said and you're going to see some of this here.

984
01:08:31.32 --> 01:08:40.68
This this efficiency this this obedience this loyalty obviously all that plays into the

985
01:08:40.68 --> 01:08:49.52
why this why this this system was able to thrive so much because you were being told

986
01:08:49.52 --> 01:08:53.16
since you were 10 years old hey you need to support you need to support the fatherland

987
01:08:53.16 --> 01:08:57.16
you need to support the Reich and you what you don't go against that.

988
01:08:57.16 --> 01:08:59.000
So something doesn't look right.

989
01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:02.000
You got you know what it's the Reich we're pushing on.

990
01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:06.76
We're you know as you like to say oh that's what we're doing.

991
01:09:06.76 --> 01:09:12.68
So character the Germans fully realize the importance of character as a basis for successful

992
01:09:12.68 --> 01:09:15.28
combat leadership.

993
01:09:15.28 --> 01:09:21.000
Their teaching on military leadership reminds officers constantly of their responsibility

994
01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:24.68
to lead by example and self-discipline.

995
01:09:24.68 --> 01:09:28.84
A book called Company Commander this is a German book a book called Company Commander

996
01:09:28.84 --> 01:09:35.72
says the Company Commander is a living example to every man in his organization to be an

997
01:09:35.72 --> 01:09:42.40
officer means to set an example for the men the officer must be his soldiers incarnation

998
01:09:42.40 --> 01:09:49.40
of soldiery his model if the German officer is inspired by this mission the best and deepest

999
01:09:49.40 --> 01:09:56.88
qualities of his soul will be awakened his life's aim will be fulfilled if he succeeds

1000
01:09:56.88 --> 01:10:03.32
through knowledge demeanor and conviction in forcing his troops to follow him this is

1001
01:10:03.32 --> 01:10:10.40
the manly purpose for which it is worthwhile to stake life in order to win life in Germany

1002
01:10:10.40 --> 01:10:17.000
the road to rank of officer is open to every capable soldier the destination destination

1003
01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:25.24
can be reached only by efficiency in time of war and by actions in face of the enemy

1004
01:10:25.24 --> 01:10:33.24
the real authority of an officer is recreated daily by his entire attitude the ancient proverb

1005
01:10:33.24 --> 01:10:39.72
applies earn it in order to possess it the more his men are convinced that the authority

1006
01:10:39.72 --> 01:10:46.000
of his rank is deserved through moral worth the stronger will be the influence of the

1007
01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:52.68
officer's personality no one should accept that rank attained by promotion will give

1008
01:10:52.68 --> 01:10:58.48
to his position authority sufficiently high enough for him to relax his effort in the

1009
01:10:58.48 --> 01:11:04.72
belief that the objective has been reached real authority is not dependent upon shoulder

1010
01:11:04.72 --> 01:11:18.16
straps stars and badges it depends only on efficiency and worth again you can't argue

1011
01:11:18.16 --> 01:11:22.52
with that and this is you know I always say if you have to pull rank in an argument then

1012
01:11:22.52 --> 01:11:26.08
you're wrong and that's what they're saying here she's not it's not your badges not your

1013
01:11:26.08 --> 01:11:32.88
straps not your stars that give you authority it's who you are and know this is a great

1014
01:11:32.88 --> 01:11:37.76
thing to remember no one should expect that rank attained by promotion will give his position

1015
01:11:37.76 --> 01:11:41.52
the authority sufficiently high enough for him to relax his effort just because you got

1016
01:11:41.52 --> 01:11:46.44
promoted doesn't mean anything you got to work harder when you get promoted that's what

1017
01:11:46.44 --> 01:11:50.12
they tell you in the Navy they're like oh cool you got promoted cool now you can work

1018
01:11:50.12 --> 01:12:00.84
harder you have more responsibility discipline has always been recognized as essential in

1019
01:12:00.84 --> 01:12:05.24
German training and the company officers are given the main responsibility for developing

1020
01:12:05.24 --> 01:12:12.000
discipline by example as well as in precept the book just quoted says on the subject

1021
01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:17.40
discipline is the basic doctrine of the army the objective of soldierly training must be

1022
01:12:17.40 --> 01:12:24.56
to make it unshake the unshakable principle of every individual if the officer per font

1023
01:12:24.56 --> 01:12:29.64
personifies physical and moral discipline and thereby sets the example for the conduct

1024
01:12:29.64 --> 01:12:34.80
of his men he will achieve his aim even in difficult situations his authority will be

1025
01:12:34.80 --> 01:12:40.84
unquestioned if he has convinced his men of his sincerity and leadership he need not

1026
01:12:40.84 --> 01:12:46.96
most be the most he need not be the most clever but he must be the most faultless man of his

1027
01:12:46.96 --> 01:12:53.76
unit the German soldier has an instinctive understanding particularly the simple man of

1028
01:12:53.76 --> 01:13:00.96
the moral qualities of his superior he cheerfully follows a leader whom he respects whom he could

1029
01:13:00.96 --> 01:13:07.12
admire daily life on the battleground forces the officer to be under the eyes of his men

1030
01:13:07.12 --> 01:13:13.80
day and night the necessities this necessitates a large amount of self-discipline both on

1031
01:13:13.80 --> 01:13:19.60
and off duty which includes not only cheerful and conscientious fulfillment of all duties

1032
01:13:19.60 --> 01:13:26.44
but also modesty in requirements for quarters and food soberness and drink self-control

1033
01:13:26.44 --> 01:13:37.04
and sexual matters cleanliness and speech and a balanced character end quote so what

1034
01:13:37.04 --> 01:13:43.60
are they looking for they're looking for that leader to be beyond reproach now I don't like

1035
01:13:43.60 --> 01:13:47.48
that they say hey the leader doesn't need to be the most clever but he needs to be the

1036
01:13:47.48 --> 01:13:51.44
most faultless and what that sets you up for is trying to cover for yourself it's trying

1037
01:13:51.44 --> 01:13:57.48
to act like you do you know everything that's a problem that's a problem but the rest of

1038
01:13:57.48 --> 01:14:07.36
it trying to set an example on and off duty right not over drinking discipline and everything

1039
01:14:07.36 --> 01:14:12.04
that you do it's weird they they talk about self-control and sexual matters like why does

1040
01:14:12.04 --> 01:14:16.80
that come up that's weird right come on bro yeah what's that no fap right yeah I mean

1041
01:14:16.80 --> 01:14:20.36
that's just a weird thing like it's it's strange that they throw that in here what's

1042
01:14:20.36 --> 01:14:24.84
going on what caused that to come out you know what I'm saying well it's one of those

1043
01:14:24.84 --> 01:14:32.24
discipline things right where if you can what refrain from I get it but like why is that

1044
01:14:32.24 --> 01:14:38.60
in here this is what this this is what a Nazi book said yeah right self-control and sexual

1045
01:14:38.60 --> 01:14:42.92
matters because there's some deviant freaks going on and he's trying to tighten it up

1046
01:14:42.92 --> 01:14:53.84
never know I guess but cleanliness and speech a balanced character goes on to say the German

1047
01:14:53.84 --> 01:14:58.16
military Bible for company officers is the manual of troop leadership this book gives

1048
01:14:58.16 --> 01:15:02.24
their basic tactical and combat doctrine and it's plenty say on the moral aspects of leadership

1049
01:15:02.24 --> 01:15:06.76
the following are some quotations here's some quotations from their books war is the severest

1050
01:15:06.76 --> 01:15:13.000
test of the spiritual and physical strength in war character outweighs intellect many

1051
01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:19.08
stand forth on the field of battle who in peace would remain unnoticed this is hype

1052
01:15:19.08 --> 01:15:23.68
trade shit right here for the troops the officer is a leader and a teacher besides

1053
01:15:23.68 --> 01:15:29.36
his knowledge of men and his sense of justice he must be distinguished by his superior knowledge

1054
01:15:29.36 --> 01:15:39.28
and experience his earnestness his self-control and his courage again hype the example and

1055
01:15:39.28 --> 01:15:45.36
personal conduct of officers and non-commissioned officers are of decisive influence on the troops

1056
01:15:45.36 --> 01:15:50.76
the officer who in the face of the enemy is cold-blooded decisive and courageous inspires

1057
01:15:50.76 --> 01:15:57.60
his troops onward the officer must likewise find the way into the hearts of his subordinates

1058
01:15:57.60 --> 01:16:04.36
and gain their trust to an understanding of their feelings and thoughts and through never

1059
01:16:04.36 --> 01:16:10.92
ceasing care of their needs mutual trust is the surest basis of discipline and necessity

1060
01:16:10.92 --> 01:16:15.88
and danger so there you go there's a little dichotomy coming at you gotta be the hardest

1061
01:16:15.88 --> 01:16:20.64
dude but at the same time you gotta care about your troops through never ceasing care of

1062
01:16:20.64 --> 01:16:32.92
their needs the Nazi dichotomy of leadership there relations of company officers with enlisted

1063
01:16:32.92 --> 01:16:38.80
personnel German Directive stressed the desirability of comradeship in units as a moral basis for

1064
01:16:38.80 --> 01:16:43.92
fighting efficiency and again the company officers are reminded of their responsibility

1065
01:16:43.92 --> 01:16:48.96
the company commander does the book again the company commander says when the soldier

1066
01:16:48.96 --> 01:16:56.08
learns by experience that he is being taken care of and that is the officer as his best

1067
01:16:56.08 --> 01:17:01.96
comrade who sees to this care then he is ready he will follow such a superior through thick

1068
01:17:01.96 --> 01:17:07.40
and thin and will cheerfully perform the most difficult duties hey Hitler you might have

1069
01:17:07.40 --> 01:17:11.24
wanted to read that paragraph when you left your boys at Stalingrad to get surrounded

1070
01:17:11.24 --> 01:17:17.68
and freaking die the officer must always set an example by his own conduct and soldierly

1071
01:17:17.68 --> 01:17:23.36
qualities he must never think of himself until his men have been cared for I mean this is

1072
01:17:23.36 --> 01:17:27.68
like leadership one on one right never think of yourself until your team is taken care

1073
01:17:27.68 --> 01:17:34.32
of only such an example can convince of the moral right to demand services from others

1074
01:17:34.32 --> 01:17:41.92
only the model life can confirm that right the officers own efficiency alone will emphasize

1075
01:17:41.92 --> 01:17:47.92
the necessity of his orders again you get that weird use the word efficiency the scary

1076
01:17:47.92 --> 01:17:53.92
word I don't like it when Nazis say efficiency it makes me nervous if the men copy the example

1077
01:17:53.92 --> 01:18:02.16
set by the officers officers and men will be joined comradely association and festivities

1078
01:18:02.16 --> 01:18:07.36
place the officer in a situation basically different from that in times of peace he must

1079
01:18:07.36 --> 01:18:12.80
never represent a contrast to the privations and restrictions which the men necessarily

1080
01:18:12.80 --> 01:18:18.04
take upon themselves and he must never forget that their need for association and festivity

1081
01:18:18.04 --> 01:18:22.80
is no less great or justified than his that than his own so that's what that's saying

1082
01:18:22.80 --> 01:18:28.56
right there is that when you're an officer and your team has to sleep in the field or

1083
01:18:28.56 --> 01:18:31.48
they have to go without food or they have to go without water you need to do the same

1084
01:18:31.48 --> 01:18:41.48
thing burdens and privations restrictions and negations are shared mutually and equally

1085
01:18:41.48 --> 01:18:49.48
every company commander must be a Spartan his must men must feel that privations mean nothing

1086
01:18:49.48 --> 01:18:59.48
to him that he rises above such problems and that daily difficulties cannot break his spirit

1087
01:18:59.48 --> 01:19:11.88
again solid advice continuing on the company officers advised to be severe when necessary

1088
01:19:11.88 --> 01:19:18.40
but without resorting to abuse to disciplinary punishment as rare to use disciplinary punishment

1089
01:19:18.40 --> 01:19:25.40
as rarely as possible and always in a way that is clearly justified to take an interest

1090
01:19:25.40 --> 01:19:30.16
in the personal difficulties of his men to maintain a cheerful atmosphere under all circumstances

1091
01:19:30.16 --> 01:19:35.52
to visit a and converse with troops in quarters and to take the greatest care in choice of

1092
01:19:35.52 --> 01:19:39.48
supervision of non-commissioned officers this does not seem like Nazi stuff.

1093
01:19:39.48 --> 01:19:45.04
That's exactly what I was thinking I was like oh dang these guys seem I'm gonna say it not

1094
01:19:45.04 --> 01:19:48.48
gonna sound correct but they kind of seem like good guys.

1095
01:19:48.48 --> 01:19:50.72
Yeah well that's that's the scary thing here.

1096
01:19:50.72 --> 01:19:56.48
It's saying like straight up like don't feel like physical discipline or right disciplinary

1097
01:19:56.48 --> 01:20:01.80
punishment is rare use disciplinary punishment as rarely as possible and and always in a

1098
01:20:01.80 --> 01:20:09.40
way that's clearly justified maintain a cheerful atmosphere as a Nazi I'm gonna maintain a cheerful

1099
01:20:09.40 --> 01:20:16.52
atmosphere doesn't sound yeah yeah it's interesting well if you know at some point maybe we'll

1100
01:20:16.52 --> 01:20:23.92
take the the Nazi theories and apply them sort of through a military lens and what it

1101
01:20:23.92 --> 01:20:28.20
would look like because what you end up with is like a tyrannical leader and you must comply

1102
01:20:28.20 --> 01:20:32.92
and everyone needs to shut up and by the way we're gonna blame when something goes wrong

1103
01:20:32.92 --> 01:20:39.28
we're gonna blame everybody else which is kind of a key component to Hitler's attitude

1104
01:20:39.28 --> 01:20:44.000
which is the reason that Germany is having these problems isn't Germany's fault it's

1105
01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:48.48
the first world war and the Versailles treaty and the Jews so it's not our fault it's everyone

1106
01:20:48.48 --> 01:20:54.56
else's fault we're just blaming everyone else so if we took that sort of higher headquarters

1107
01:20:54.56 --> 01:20:59.24
Nazi philosophy and put it through a mill put it on the military lens this will look

1108
01:20:59.24 --> 01:21:01.48
a lot different.

1109
01:21:01.48 --> 01:21:06.72
Taking it back to the book German officers are expected to give attention to the mental

1110
01:21:06.72 --> 01:21:13.04
outlook of their men and this includes giving them frequent talks on the war the soldier

1111
01:21:13.04 --> 01:21:20.04
must know what the war is that the war is his personal affair and he must be instructed

1112
01:21:20.04 --> 01:21:27.60
on its causes meaning and progress it is believed that the soldiers who are informed as to why

1113
01:21:27.60 --> 01:21:35.32
they are fighting and of their part in the battle will show improved discipline in combat

1114
01:21:35.32 --> 01:21:41.16
you've got to explain the why newspapers radio and books are used to assist toward this end

1115
01:21:41.16 --> 01:21:46.44
an article in a military review advises the company commander to assemble his unit once

1116
01:21:46.44 --> 01:21:51.88
a week for discussion the father of the company should speak on all matters official and unofficial

1117
01:21:51.88 --> 01:21:57.52
current events politics which influence the mental attitudes and morale of the men troop

1118
01:21:57.52 --> 01:22:04.32
leadership reminds officers that quote the leaders must live with their troops participating

1119
01:22:04.32 --> 01:22:08.44
in their dangers their wants their joys their sorrows only in this way can they estimate

1120
01:22:08.44 --> 01:22:15.40
the battle worth and the requirement of the requirements of the troops man is not responsible

1121
01:22:15.40 --> 01:22:22.32
for himself alone but for his comrades he can do more who has greater capacity of accomplishment

1122
01:22:22.32 --> 01:22:27.96
must instruct the inexperienced and weaker from such conduct the feeling of real comradeship

1123
01:22:27.96 --> 01:22:32.76
develops which is just as important between the leaders and the men as between the men

1124
01:22:32.76 --> 01:22:38.52
themselves troops welded together only superficially and not through long training and experience

1125
01:22:38.52 --> 01:22:46.16
more easily fail under severe strain and under unexpected crisis therefore before the outbreak

1126
01:22:46.16 --> 01:22:50.88
of war the development and maintenance of steadfastness and discipline in the troops

1127
01:22:50.88 --> 01:23:00.40
as well as their training is of decisive importance so look that's from their book the exact same

1128
01:23:00.40 --> 01:23:06.40
stuff that you'll hear in the US military the precepts outlined above have been actually

1129
01:23:06.40 --> 01:23:11.56
carried out as us or observers have reported during the past few years one report states

1130
01:23:11.56 --> 01:23:17.48
German leadership is based on mutual respect between officer and man we were again impressed

1131
01:23:17.48 --> 01:23:26.04
with the fact that cooperation between officers and men works both ways we're going to get

1132
01:23:26.04 --> 01:23:32.80
into principles of leadership section six the training of German officers of all grades

1133
01:23:32.80 --> 01:23:38.52
for the present war has been so conducted to emphasize certain basic doctrines while

1134
01:23:38.52 --> 01:23:42.72
these may seem rather general and character they must be understood in order to appreciate

1135
01:23:42.72 --> 01:23:47.76
German tactics according to observers German combat tactics reflect the application of

1136
01:23:47.76 --> 01:23:55.36
these doctrines which are by no means pious phrases of military theorists the very concrete

1137
01:23:55.36 --> 01:24:01.36
and practical manual on troop leadership is full of references to these principles as

1138
01:24:01.36 --> 01:24:07.04
later quotations will show the German army has been organized and trained to operate

1139
01:24:07.04 --> 01:24:12.20
as the task force principle according to the definition of task force is a unit of arms

1140
01:24:12.20 --> 01:24:15.92
of all arms and services under one commander for the accomplishment of a single specified

1141
01:24:15.92 --> 01:24:20.80
mission this principle operates at all levels of command when a mission is assigned to a

1142
01:24:20.80 --> 01:24:26.68
commander he is given the means judge necessary to accomplishment to accomplish it this these

1143
01:24:26.68 --> 01:24:31.32
means are turned over to him for combined training by which his men are molded into

1144
01:24:31.32 --> 01:24:35.52
a combat team the members of this team must know their mission and work together for its

1145
01:24:35.52 --> 01:24:39.56
accomplishment individual units are called upon to merge into the structure of the command

1146
01:24:39.56 --> 01:24:43.44
team of the combat team the training phase permits commanders and staff to become thoroughly

1147
01:24:43.44 --> 01:24:48.80
acquainted with all their officers in this way they learn one another shortcomings and

1148
01:24:48.80 --> 01:24:54.000
strong points so that many later misunderstandings are prevented in the stress of combat personal

1149
01:24:54.000 --> 01:25:00.000
combinations thus built up often become so strong that they are maintained through successive

1150
01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:08.68
campaigns every effort is made to discourage rivalry between components of a team for example

1151
01:25:08.68 --> 01:25:13.20
through march song though march songs are highly regarded and developed there are no

1152
01:25:13.20 --> 01:25:19.72
songs about the superiority of infantry to engineers or artillery etc there are no inter

1153
01:25:19.72 --> 01:25:25.68
company or inter battery athletics to develop useless competitive emotions commanders of

1154
01:25:25.68 --> 01:25:30.12
subordinate units are so imbued with the feeling of cooperation that they go out of their way

1155
01:25:30.12 --> 01:25:36.20
to assist one another they cover and move for each other considerable attention is given

1156
01:25:36.20 --> 01:25:43.20
to the acquaintance of officers of one branch with the weapons and tactics of another even

1157
01:25:43.20 --> 01:25:47.04
the manual of a specialized branch shows this effort anti-aircraft gunners manual has a

1158
01:25:47.04 --> 01:25:51.68
section on what these gunners must know about their employment as part of ground forces

1159
01:25:51.68 --> 01:26:00.56
teams including a discussion of divisional tactics the greatest factor in successful

1160
01:26:00.56 --> 01:26:05.24
deployment of armed troops is speed in obtaining the initial coordination of arms and in the

1161
01:26:05.24 --> 01:26:13.16
execution of a coordinated mission by various arms so they are absolutely pushing for everyone

1162
01:26:13.16 --> 01:26:21.60
to work together that's what they're pushing for we have to cover and move for each other

1163
01:26:21.60 --> 01:26:26.000
their next principle is aggressiveness and a niche initiative some people say default

1164
01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:34.44
aggressive I've heard the prime characteristic of German tactical doctrine is maintenance

1165
01:26:34.44 --> 01:26:40.48
of the initiative and avoidance of stabilization the Germans believe absolutely that if a trained

1166
01:26:40.48 --> 01:26:46.36
commander prepares and executes aggressive moves even with even average ability and reasonable

1167
01:26:46.36 --> 01:26:54.32
speed the enemy will be kept too busy meeting them to carry out a successful offensive measures

1168
01:26:54.32 --> 01:26:58.24
the German officer phrase the concept in a way that can be understood by troops our men

1169
01:26:58.24 --> 01:27:03.36
are taught that their own safety depends upon their getting to the enemy's rear and not

1170
01:27:03.36 --> 01:27:07.12
staying in front of him this is fundamental of our training these guys are looking to

1171
01:27:07.12 --> 01:27:14.44
flank all day long aggressive tactics require the use of initiative by combat leaders down

1172
01:27:14.44 --> 01:27:17.96
to the platoon commanders and non-commissioned officers development of this capacity for

1173
01:27:17.96 --> 01:27:21.92
taking the initiative is stressed at all points in military training whether theoretical or

1174
01:27:21.92 --> 01:27:27.40
practical no illusion surviving the first world war is more dangerous than the notion

1175
01:27:27.40 --> 01:27:33.68
that German leaders especially of small units are bound by rigid and mechanical regulations

1176
01:27:33.68 --> 01:27:38.96
and can move only in accordance with detailed pre-arranged plans so again that's what they

1177
01:27:38.96 --> 01:27:47.64
started this war of this 1942 by the end Hitler was dictating they lost this in actual fact

1178
01:27:47.64 --> 01:27:52.12
German leaders of small units have shown great skill in this war adapting their tactics and

1179
01:27:52.12 --> 01:27:57.32
flecks flexibility to meet new situations they have been trained to do this the handbook on

1180
01:27:57.32 --> 01:28:03.60
the German squad and combat illustrates the doc the this doctrine quote in the execution

1181
01:28:03.60 --> 01:28:09.32
of battle missions one should be most careful to avoid the idea that only one solution can

1182
01:28:09.32 --> 01:28:15.48
be right can be the right one only success in an actual case could prove that a given

1183
01:28:15.48 --> 01:28:21.84
solution was the right one a model solution must not be drilled into the soldiers they

1184
01:28:21.84 --> 01:28:26.96
and particularly the squad leader should be trained to be flexible and should learn to

1185
01:28:26.96 --> 01:28:33.28
be equal on any occasion so this is kind of the antithesis of what you think of a Nazi

1186
01:28:33.28 --> 01:28:41.44
right just calling out for flexibility and for free thought I mean free thought is the

1187
01:28:41.44 --> 01:28:45.92
antithesis of Nazi attitude Nazi attitudes we're all gonna think the same thing that's

1188
01:28:45.92 --> 01:28:50.28
why we're gonna start indoctrinating you when you're 10 years old no we want you to have

1189
01:28:50.28 --> 01:28:55.36
free thought and ultimately this kind of thing this is one of the things that leads

1190
01:28:55.36 --> 01:29:00.80
America to have that open mind on the battlefield to see what we can adjust to figure out what

1191
01:29:00.80 --> 01:29:10.36
we need to change and start winning German regulations place due value on getting as

1192
01:29:10.36 --> 01:29:15.20
much information as possible about the enemy as a prerequisite for action but regulations

1193
01:29:15.20 --> 01:29:20.96
also prevent this from becoming a requirement that crypt cripples action this is a dichotomy

1194
01:29:20.96 --> 01:29:23.72
of leadership hey you look you got to get good information but don't let it cripple

1195
01:29:23.72 --> 01:29:32.56
you and wait for it quote obscurity of the situation is the rule seldom will one have

1196
01:29:32.56 --> 01:29:38.64
exact information of the enemy clarification of hostile situation is is self evident is

1197
01:29:38.64 --> 01:29:44.88
a self evident demand however to wait intense situations for information is seldom a token

1198
01:29:44.88 --> 01:29:49.72
of strong leadership but often one of weakness you say you got to take action you're you

1199
01:29:49.72 --> 01:29:55.80
got to be aggressive that's got to be a default mode so the officer is taught to attack in

1200
01:29:55.80 --> 01:30:01.000
order to clear up the situation that's a great quote you want to know what's going on attack

1201
01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:06.84
you figured out and gain a basis for an estimate of further action battle itself proves the

1202
01:30:06.84 --> 01:30:12.40
most reliable means of estimating the enemy oh that's a good one I don't recommend that

1203
01:30:12.40 --> 01:30:19.40
a bar fight let's see how tough this guy is all right omission and delay are regarded

1204
01:30:19.40 --> 01:30:25.12
as greater crimes than the choice of the wrong method of action in training exercises the

1205
01:30:25.12 --> 01:30:29.84
choice of a tactical method is subject to full criticism by reviewing officers but no man

1206
01:30:29.84 --> 01:30:36.80
is reprimanded because he tried to do something and failed they want you to do something even

1207
01:30:36.80 --> 01:30:42.56
that's a big one I mean kind of it wouldn't seem that way but it seems like that's a very

1208
01:30:42.56 --> 01:30:46.48
surprising one right there they want you to take action that that's that's the crazy thing

1209
01:30:46.48 --> 01:30:51.16
about this this is what we don't think the specific fact that like you'll be you'll be

1210
01:30:51.16 --> 01:30:58.04
less reprimanded if you do the wrong thing yeah like you think oh you know okay so you

1211
01:30:58.04 --> 01:31:02.56
know like the expression right don't be a Nazi about it like grammar not yeah or you know

1212
01:31:02.56 --> 01:31:06.72
soup not here you know like that just as a whatever that kind of expression it kind of

1213
01:31:06.72 --> 01:31:12.16
says the opposite of that where it's like you better do it correctly or almost feels

1214
01:31:12.16 --> 01:31:15.40
like they're saying do it correctly or don't do it all almost kind of things what it feels

1215
01:31:15.40 --> 01:31:20.56
like nonetheless it does feel like do not make a mistake yeah or die kind of a thing

1216
01:31:20.56 --> 01:31:25.16
kind of a feeling that's kind of funny like if you were to like the grammar not see one

1217
01:31:25.16 --> 01:31:31.08
yeah think about if you were legitimately just paranoid about making a mistake and having

1218
01:31:31.08 --> 01:31:35.40
the grammar not see come at you and so what are you gonna do you're not gonna write it

1219
01:31:35.40 --> 01:31:39.84
yeah so you do what yeah you're just gonna sit there yeah you're not gonna put the word

1220
01:31:39.84 --> 01:31:45.40
out she gotta be like hey grammar not see no yeah get you can say hey you might want

1221
01:31:45.40 --> 01:31:49.28
to get just me here but good try that's what they say that's that's being a grammar not

1222
01:31:49.28 --> 01:32:01.44
see that's all right here's some quotations from the troop leadership manual the teaching

1223
01:32:01.44 --> 01:32:07.36
of the conduct of war cannot be concentrated exhaustively in regulations the principles

1224
01:32:07.36 --> 01:32:13.80
so unannunciated must be employed dependent upon their situation it's the same thing dude

1225
01:32:13.80 --> 01:32:19.000
it's not about regulations you gotta figure it out the emptiness of the battlefield depend

1226
01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:24.08
demands independent thinking and acting of fighters who considering each situation are

1227
01:32:24.08 --> 01:32:30.000
dominated by determination to act boldly and decisively and to arrive at success we just

1228
01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:37.12
want you to go figure it out we don't care how you do it the first demand in war is decisive

1229
01:32:37.12 --> 01:32:43.32
action everyone the highest commander the most junior soldier must be aware that omissions

1230
01:32:43.32 --> 01:32:50.32
and neglect incriminate him more severely than mistake and choice of means great success

1231
01:32:50.32 --> 01:32:55.40
presume boldness and daring proceeded by good judgment they're just telling us these troops

1232
01:32:55.40 --> 01:33:00.000
over and over again make something happen we never have at our disposal all the desired

1233
01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:06.24
forces for the decisive action he who will be secure everywhere or who fixes forces and

1234
01:33:06.24 --> 01:33:13.28
secondary tasks acts contrary to the fundamental yeah I just need a few more troops to go no

1235
01:33:13.28 --> 01:33:20.56
go hold on we're gonna hold we got set security no go hold on I need to figure out what the

1236
01:33:20.56 --> 01:33:28.12
enemy's doing no go the weaker the force through speed mobility great march accomplishment

1237
01:33:28.12 --> 01:33:32.20
surprise and deception the utilization of darkness and terrain to the fullest can be stronger

1238
01:33:32.20 --> 01:33:39.04
at the decisive area time and space must be correctly estimated favorably situations favorable

1239
01:33:39.04 --> 01:33:44.000
situations quickly recognized and decisively exploited every advantage over the enemy increases

1240
01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:50.12
our own freedom of action the attack is launched in order to defeat the enemy the attacker has

1241
01:33:50.12 --> 01:33:54.48
the initiative superiority of leadership and of troops shows to the best advantage in the

1242
01:33:54.48 --> 01:34:01.72
attack success does not always come to the superiority of numbers a German officer commenting

1243
01:34:01.72 --> 01:34:07.08
on the clearly commenting early on the early campaigns of the war recognized the capacity

1244
01:34:07.08 --> 01:34:12.36
of very young officers to meet these standards of leadership so this is pretty impressive

1245
01:34:12.36 --> 01:34:16.28
before the campaign in the West we underestimated the wonderful leadership of our 22 year old

1246
01:34:16.28 --> 01:34:20.80
company commanders they acted without hesitation where older men would have paused for long

1247
01:34:20.80 --> 01:34:25.56
consideration and heavy artillery reinforcements time and time again we found these young commanders

1248
01:34:25.56 --> 01:34:30.04
calling for a few 88 millimeter anti aircraft guns a handful of anti-tank guns and a platoon

1249
01:34:30.04 --> 01:34:35.52
pie a platoon of pioneers to assist them in taking a famous fortress and then actually

1250
01:34:35.52 --> 01:34:39.88
capturing it with no delay and relatively few losses the enthusiastic leadership of

1251
01:34:39.88 --> 01:34:45.68
youth was one of the great features of our advance West so they did they actually this

1252
01:34:45.68 --> 01:34:49.76
is like one of those things where you program the robot and then it like does even better

1253
01:34:49.76 --> 01:34:55.04
than you thought it was going to do they told these guys advance you know fight go be aggressive

1254
01:34:55.04 --> 01:35:03.48
and that's what they did and it worked and they were surprised by it next section is

1255
01:35:03.48 --> 01:35:08.84
orders and communications aggressiveness cannot serve as the sole principle of tactics without

1256
01:35:08.84 --> 01:35:13.16
leading to disaster so there's the dichotomy we want to be aggressive but if you're just

1257
01:35:13.16 --> 01:35:18.000
being aggressive it can be a disaster German training supplements that principle with careful

1258
01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:25.64
attention to all measures which provide that action taken shall be considered and intelligent

1259
01:35:25.64 --> 01:35:34.04
these measures include orders clear orders and an efficient system of communications

1260
01:35:34.04 --> 01:35:39.48
simple clear and concise orders that's what this goes into orders should be clear and

1261
01:35:39.48 --> 01:35:45.000
direct should confine themselves to the main lines of a mission assigned to the lower command

1262
01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:48.60
giving the lower command latitude of choice of the means to execute the mission so here's

1263
01:35:48.60 --> 01:35:53.72
what you got to do we don't care how you do it the Germans believe that one of the signs

1264
01:35:53.72 --> 01:35:58.24
of deterioration in their armies toward the end of the first world war was the growing

1265
01:35:58.24 --> 01:36:05.36
verbosity and ambiguity of orders they propose to avoid these mistakes by constantly drilling

1266
01:36:05.36 --> 01:36:11.36
conciseness and clarity isn't it interesting as I'm talking to you more it's becoming

1267
01:36:11.36 --> 01:36:16.28
more ambiguous that's what they're saying yeah we started falling part of the end of

1268
01:36:16.28 --> 01:36:23.24
world war one why the more we talked the less people understood what was happening that's

1269
01:36:23.24 --> 01:36:31.48
a that's a freaking very interesting very interesting dichotomy this is an interesting

1270
01:36:31.48 --> 01:36:38.64
statement here when we start talking about the way these guys are sort of living their

1271
01:36:38.64 --> 01:36:47.56
lives no German officer begins the day without a mission if the mission has not been received

1272
01:36:47.56 --> 01:36:53.60
received from higher authority he gives himself a mission for the day and one which is definitely

1273
01:36:53.60 --> 01:36:59.04
not a mere compliance with a printed schedule the printed schedule is nothing but a time

1274
01:36:59.04 --> 01:37:05.40
allotment or control he approaches this is the German officer approaches each day's

1275
01:37:05.40 --> 01:37:12.92
task as he would a battle in order that eventually he will approach battle as he would a day's

1276
01:37:12.92 --> 01:37:26.92
task just kind of live in the life the manual of troop leadership says on this subject of

1277
01:37:26.92 --> 01:37:31.88
orders the order puts the decision into effect clear orders are essential for the frictionless

1278
01:37:31.88 --> 01:37:36.28
cooperation of all commanders for the higher commander the written order provides the foundation

1279
01:37:36.28 --> 01:37:41.80
for leadership it is communicated to the lower units printed in carbon copy type written

1280
01:37:41.80 --> 01:37:46.28
or written by hand or by technical communication means frequently is dictated dictated over

1281
01:37:46.28 --> 01:37:51.48
the telephone in every instance the most sure and suitable method of transmission is to

1282
01:37:51.48 --> 01:38:00.36
be chosen the more pressing the situation the shorter the order is a mistake everybody

1283
01:38:00.36 --> 01:38:10.56
makes what's what's challenging about that is in order for me to give you an order in

1284
01:38:10.56 --> 01:38:15.48
a pressing situation I have to be able to look at the situation simplify it and then

1285
01:38:15.48 --> 01:38:21.64
distill it the order down into something that's like hey we need to move north now and there's

1286
01:38:21.64 --> 01:38:25.80
a lot of other things going on what we need to do is we need to move north now and get

1287
01:38:25.80 --> 01:38:32.36
this terrain features solidified boom that's it go that's one of the most challenging things

1288
01:38:32.36 --> 01:38:38.28
that leaders one of the most challenging things for leaders to do is to look at complex situation

1289
01:38:38.28 --> 01:38:45.36
and simplify them and then verbalize what needs to happen that's something you can practice

1290
01:38:45.36 --> 01:38:50.52
that's something you should think about all the time that's something when you when you

1291
01:38:50.52 --> 01:38:55.36
are going to talk to your team you should write down what you're going to say and say

1292
01:38:55.36 --> 01:39:00.40
it in as few words as possible that's one thing I kind of liked about Twitter back

1293
01:39:00.40 --> 01:39:05.84
back in the day when I was on Twitter a lot it was fun you had to like you had to like

1294
01:39:05.84 --> 01:39:11.28
you had 140 characters and then they made it easy gave you 280 characters but back in

1295
01:39:11.28 --> 01:39:17.36
the day 140 characters you had that's what you're going to do it's good practice became

1296
01:39:17.36 --> 01:39:24.52
ambiguous after one I did you know there's a that always reminds me of the ethics life

1297
01:39:24.52 --> 01:39:31.76
maybe yeah life tells the story of BTF Tony or Lafell go through his his orders or whatever

1298
01:39:31.76 --> 01:39:37.56
he's telling everybody and then BTF Tony will be like hey I'm going to remember three of

1299
01:39:37.56 --> 01:39:44.24
those things which of them do you want them to be yeah classic Tony that I mean that would

1300
01:39:44.24 --> 01:39:49.28
be so fun to say in a real situation I don't know how many people I could pull that off

1301
01:39:49.28 --> 01:39:54.24
with without the beginning kind of mad at me but if you pull it off that'd be sweet yeah

1302
01:39:54.24 --> 01:39:59.24
well you can't get mad at BTF Tony for a bunch of reasons don't want to be awesome number

1303
01:39:59.24 --> 01:40:09.08
two because he's right he's telling you the truth and you got to be happy with important

1304
01:40:09.08 --> 01:40:15.52
orders it is often advisable to use two or more means of transmission that makes sense

1305
01:40:15.52 --> 01:40:20.48
it is easy to underestimate the time required to get an order through oh that's a important

1306
01:40:20.48 --> 01:40:25.44
one I told those guys yesterday oh they didn't get the word yet big shocker too many orders

1307
01:40:25.44 --> 01:40:30.20
especially in battle during which communication means may miscarry produce the danger of an

1308
01:40:30.20 --> 01:40:37.04
impairing independence of action of lower commanders so if I'm giving you orders all the time eventually

1309
01:40:37.04 --> 01:40:40.24
you're just waiting for orders that's just I'm centralizing command and I'm micromanaging

1310
01:40:40.24 --> 01:40:44.56
it's going to be a problem an order shall contain all that is necessary for the lower

1311
01:40:44.56 --> 01:40:49.24
commander to know in order for him to execute independently his task it should contain no

1312
01:40:49.24 --> 01:40:57.96
more then they got a they got a chunk in here about communications but they're starting

1313
01:40:57.96 --> 01:41:08.84
to talk about like their technical communication so no factor here as contact is gained with

1314
01:41:08.84 --> 01:41:16.96
the enemy it is better that the division commander be where he can observe therefore he belongs

1315
01:41:16.96 --> 01:41:23.36
early on the field of battle and in the decisive area his location must be easily found easily

1316
01:41:23.36 --> 01:41:30.64
reached in attack the division command post should be located as far forward as possible

1317
01:41:30.64 --> 01:41:35.96
stand by for dichotomy yet so selected that the communication net to the side and rear

1318
01:41:35.96 --> 01:41:42.28
is effectively shielded from hostile fire to be desired our observation of the battlefield

1319
01:41:42.28 --> 01:41:46.48
either from the command post or nearby observation post and the possibility of establishing an

1320
01:41:46.48 --> 01:41:52.56
airplane landing field nearby so there's a dichotomy the Nazi dichotomy I've said that

1321
01:41:52.56 --> 01:42:02.16
twice now I'm a little scared I don't want to make that a thing knowledge of terrain

1322
01:42:02.16 --> 01:42:07.96
the usual attention is paid in German training to correct use of maps as a basis for utilizing

1323
01:42:07.96 --> 01:42:14.20
terrain and maneuver but the German doctrine is that maps should be so thoroughly studied

1324
01:42:14.20 --> 01:42:20.52
that they can be largely dispensed with during maneuvers and observer who commented on the

1325
01:42:20.52 --> 01:42:25.60
small use of maps during tank exercises was told that the officer who must constantly

1326
01:42:25.60 --> 01:42:31.40
refer to a map for orientation purposes considered poorly trained the map one study should be

1327
01:42:31.40 --> 01:42:38.96
carried in the mind rather than in the hand that's when you get in the military that's

1328
01:42:38.96 --> 01:42:47.48
sort of like from a leadership perspective understanding terrain is like blue belt level

1329
01:42:47.48 --> 01:42:52.68
like and you know the difference between someone that doesn't train in a blue belt is massive

1330
01:42:52.68 --> 01:42:57.24
yeah that's when you start to look at terrain and understand terrain that's like when you

1331
01:42:57.24 --> 01:43:00.72
get your blue belt you're like okay I understand I understand how I can utilize the terrain

1332
01:43:00.72 --> 01:43:06.96
that we're facing to our advantage yeah and what you're saying just the method to do it

1333
01:43:06.96 --> 01:43:12.36
like the skill of it yep versus no skill and even when you train when we train a seals

1334
01:43:12.36 --> 01:43:16.000
like when we first go out and do immediate action drills so we practice getting in gun

1335
01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:19.24
fights and breaking contact with the enemy or assaulting the enemy the first thing we

1336
01:43:19.24 --> 01:43:25.32
do is we do it on a big flat open field desert but it's a big flat piece of sand there's

1337
01:43:25.32 --> 01:43:29.64
no terrain it's just flat and you're just going through the mechanics and then as you

1338
01:43:29.64 --> 01:43:33.80
get better you start incorporating little pieces of terrain and then eventually you're using

1339
01:43:33.80 --> 01:43:41.80
like wild terrain features next section is called surprise during the training phase

1340
01:43:41.80 --> 01:43:45.52
the importance of the principle of surprise in combat is constantly featured according

1341
01:43:45.52 --> 01:43:50.04
to German doctrine surprise depends on the use of secrecy deception and speed secrecy

1342
01:43:50.04 --> 01:43:55.48
this depends on maintaining the strictest discipline among troops according to German

1343
01:43:55.48 --> 01:44:02.60
military authorities the use of deception to achieve surprise is comparatively unexploited

1344
01:44:02.60 --> 01:44:11.16
speed of execution of any maneuver is an essential is essential for achieving surprise this principle

1345
01:44:11.16 --> 01:44:15.84
is extended to artillery practice and observer notes that as much importance is now put on

1346
01:44:15.84 --> 01:44:21.88
the speed of opening fire as an accuracy and as the attainment of heavy volume of fire

1347
01:44:21.88 --> 01:44:28.52
so you're going to surprise people again this is a speed surprise and violence of action

1348
01:44:28.52 --> 01:44:37.20
that's what you learn day two at the SEAL team section seven training methods subsection

1349
01:44:37.20 --> 01:44:44.64
twenty physical conditioning and marching the importance of physical condition is fully

1350
01:44:44.64 --> 01:44:49.76
recognized in German training doctrine one of the services of the Hitler youth with its

1351
01:44:49.76 --> 01:44:53.88
emphasis on sports and the labor service is to furnish the army with recruits who are

1352
01:44:53.88 --> 01:44:59.92
fully conditioned and toughened the training period is thereby shortened and made more

1353
01:44:59.92 --> 01:45:08.88
effective a US observer saw an infantry battalion on maneuvers in January 1940 with the temperature

1354
01:45:08.88 --> 01:45:14.92
at 20 degrees the troops lay patiently in four inches of snow waiting their orders for

1355
01:45:14.92 --> 01:45:21.44
over an hour many men had no gloves this difficult period seemed to have no effect on their performance

1356
01:45:21.44 --> 01:45:31.04
later the hardening other observers of a German division in the field exercises before the

1357
01:45:31.04 --> 01:45:37.000
outbreak of war reported that fitness and endurance were made a fetish by both officers

1358
01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:44.48
and men the training purposes officers vote sorry for training purposes officers often

1359
01:45:44.48 --> 01:45:50.92
went 24 hours without food troops carried heavy loads of mortars machine guns and other equipment

1360
01:45:50.92 --> 01:45:57.32
as far as 1200 yards in fast rushes of 50 yards just before the exercises one engineer battalion

1361
01:45:57.32 --> 01:46:05.84
had marched 85 miles through the mountains in three days good physical condition has

1362
01:46:05.84 --> 01:46:13.40
been a basis for the notable March achievement of the German infantry despite all the mechanization

1363
01:46:13.40 --> 01:46:17.56
of modern armies German doctrine for saw the possibility that motorized personnel might

1364
01:46:17.56 --> 01:46:21.60
lose their equipment and have to move rapidly on foot in some cases German troops under

1365
01:46:21.60 --> 01:46:26.12
the prolonged strain of combat operations have covered 30 to 40 miles a day for several

1366
01:46:26.12 --> 01:46:33.88
days and German sources claim a march of 44 miles and 24 hours during the Polish campaign

1367
01:46:33.88 --> 01:46:38.40
reserve formations of older men or heart are held to nearly the same high standards despite

1368
01:46:38.40 --> 01:46:43.60
these achievements demand is made for even grading greater attention to marching an article

1369
01:46:43.60 --> 01:46:52.000
in a German military review from 1940 states peacetime marching practice though good was

1370
01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:57.76
not strenuous enough to prepare men for wartime marching conditions in peacetime marching

1371
01:46:57.76 --> 01:47:05.40
too much consideration is given to the comfort and convenience of the troops despicable tone

1372
01:47:05.40 --> 01:47:14.64
added by me yeah you have these American observers over there 1940 actually know my grandfather

1373
01:47:14.64 --> 01:47:21.88
was in the army and he was over in Nazi Germany in 1939 and he was he was talking to Nazi

1374
01:47:21.88 --> 01:47:32.12
I have I have his passport and he actually he was an engineer and he ended up befriending

1375
01:47:32.12 --> 01:47:39.60
one of the Nazi German or Nazi army engineers that worked on weapon systems and he he became

1376
01:47:39.60 --> 01:47:44.08
friends with him and got a bunch of blueprints of their weapon systems and stole them and

1377
01:47:44.08 --> 01:47:51.52
brought them back to America and turned them over they do espionage but I have I had his

1378
01:47:51.52 --> 01:47:55.40
passport I don't know where it is right now I think my dad might have it but his passport

1379
01:47:55.40 --> 01:47:59.72
has like all the Nazi squastika stamps in it and stuff and when he was over there and

1380
01:47:59.72 --> 01:48:06.08
you know my grandfather spoke Dutch and so he met someone that they could communicate

1381
01:48:06.08 --> 01:48:11.68
with huh like oh he spoke to when did you because obviously he was American sit where

1382
01:48:11.68 --> 01:48:17.28
do you know when your family moved that that side of the family came here on the boat in

1383
01:48:17.28 --> 01:48:27.04
like 1900 or something like that mmm yeah it's crazy thinking about those times like

1384
01:48:27.04 --> 01:48:32.32
those were actual real times you know like before you were born you know it feels like

1385
01:48:32.32 --> 01:48:36.04
in your brain it's almost like oh that's just it's almost like a movie you know before

1386
01:48:36.04 --> 01:48:40.36
you were born is more like just a movie and all this stuff but it was like an actual time

1387
01:48:40.36 --> 01:48:44.68
where people are actually living actually going through their day to day life yeah and you

1388
01:48:44.68 --> 01:48:55.16
actually and you were like you did not exist no it's a hard one to contemplate sometimes

1389
01:48:55.16 --> 01:49:01.68
I will I regret to inform you that the world has been here before you were here at the

1390
01:49:01.68 --> 01:49:11.84
world was not created the moment I was born all right cool just saying emphasis on field

1391
01:49:11.84 --> 01:49:16.40
exercises even the training at the German General Staff avoids abstract theory in tactics and

1392
01:49:16.40 --> 01:49:20.56
strategy the students thoroughly grounded in fundamental principles of tactics but he

1393
01:49:20.56 --> 01:49:25.16
is taught to apply them concrete by case study method in which a specific situation must be

1394
01:49:25.16 --> 01:49:29.72
stated and solved tactical training at the school is given almost entirely by means of

1395
01:49:29.72 --> 01:49:35.04
free maneuvers on the map and on the ground no fixed divisional organization is used in

1396
01:49:35.04 --> 01:49:39.68
this training and the combination of arms and division is continually varied the exercises

1397
01:49:39.68 --> 01:49:44.88
are so conducted that the officer student as commander and his staff oppose either the

1398
01:49:44.88 --> 01:49:49.16
instructor or another student group the student is given very little information of the enemy

1399
01:49:49.16 --> 01:49:53.64
positions and is required to make immediate decisions put into verbal orders movement

1400
01:49:53.64 --> 01:49:58.16
is controlled by factors of time space terrain firepower and mobility and by no other control

1401
01:49:58.16 --> 01:50:03.12
features coordination of effort is assured by staff action during movement rather than

1402
01:50:03.12 --> 01:50:08.72
by attempting elaborate plans in advance field work is done is field work is given central

1403
01:50:08.72 --> 01:50:14.28
emphasis in the program of training for troops small units carry out tactical problems day

1404
01:50:14.28 --> 01:50:19.68
in day out tactical exercises fill in half the time training this is just squared away

1405
01:50:19.68 --> 01:50:23.56
and you can have a you can do you can do such awesome rope and we've done a bunch of stuff

1406
01:50:23.56 --> 01:50:27.52
at Escalon front we got the FTX going obviously where this is what you're doing you're gonna

1407
01:50:27.52 --> 01:50:31.84
get you're gonna get like a little bit of information you got a timeline that you gotta

1408
01:50:31.84 --> 01:50:35.64
meet you got enemy moving you got friendly forces got all this stuff going on and that's

1409
01:50:35.64 --> 01:50:39.56
why we do it so you can learn how to lead we're doing something now we call the leadership

1410
01:50:39.56 --> 01:50:44.48
lab where it's not a combat scenario it's a business it's business scenarios so you're

1411
01:50:44.48 --> 01:50:48.76
going in and you've got a staff that you've got to work with and you've got things that

1412
01:50:48.76 --> 01:50:53.48
are happening at your company who plays the staff other people in the company or role

1413
01:50:53.48 --> 01:50:58.64
players role players role players play the staff it's it's pretty awesome like oh hey

1414
01:50:58.64 --> 01:51:05.84
we've got hey hey listen boss or listen whatever plant plant manager hey plant manager you

1415
01:51:05.84 --> 01:51:09.88
got a complaint one of your one of your employees is flying off the handle right now who says

1416
01:51:09.88 --> 01:51:13.48
that they're getting treated unfairly they're coming to your office right now they'll be

1417
01:51:13.48 --> 01:51:20.72
here in three minutes oh by the way as soon as that's over you there's a there's a reporter

1418
01:51:20.72 --> 01:51:24.12
here you got to do a small press conference as a group of reporters here they want to know

1419
01:51:24.12 --> 01:51:28.52
about this product that you made that's made a bunch of kids sick in the local neighborhood

1420
01:51:28.52 --> 01:51:31.88
so you get ready for that press conference and then you go to the press conference guess

1421
01:51:31.88 --> 01:51:36.76
what you guess what happens you could ask a bunch of questions by role players do you

1422
01:51:36.76 --> 01:51:39.84
are you saying that your profit is more important than the safety of the children you know like

1423
01:51:39.84 --> 01:51:46.12
all that kind of stuff so good yeah that makes sense yeah echelonfront.com leadership lab

1424
01:51:46.12 --> 01:51:50.84
check it out you want to put your key executives through some awesome training where they learn

1425
01:51:50.84 --> 01:51:58.60
these these types of leadership skills that's it fast forward a little bit the concept of

1426
01:51:58.60 --> 01:52:06.56
wartime training stated was stated in a German training directive in 1941 in spite of greater

1427
01:52:06.56 --> 01:52:11.72
difficulties than in time of peace training must be conducted as thoroughly and methodically

1428
01:52:11.72 --> 01:52:17.84
as possible it is only by inspiring a desire for intellectual cooperation and by constantly

1429
01:52:17.84 --> 01:52:23.24
keeping it alive among the lower ranks that the correct tactical conceptions can be successfully

1430
01:52:23.24 --> 01:52:30.76
inculcated in the ranks down to the most humble non-commissioned officer.

1431
01:52:30.76 --> 01:52:36.60
Realism the realism of training no element of training doctrine is given more stress

1432
01:52:36.60 --> 01:52:42.92
than the demand for a maximum effect of realism claus witz the guide of so much modern military

1433
01:52:42.92 --> 01:52:48.60
theory stated the principle very exactly at a period when the methods and techniques of

1434
01:52:48.60 --> 01:52:53.60
warfare put less strain than they do now on the troops entering battle for the first time

1435
01:52:53.60 --> 01:52:58.36
that's an interesting statement like hey back in the day is nothing compared to what you're

1436
01:52:58.36 --> 01:53:05.32
going into combat in 1942 and there's machine guns and you know miss or schmitz overhead

1437
01:53:05.32 --> 01:53:09.40
strafing your area and people are just getting blown up like this is a totally different

1438
01:53:09.40 --> 01:53:16.000
ballgame but this is a good way of putting it from claus witz no general can supply his

1439
01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:22.28
army with war experience and the substitute of peacetime drills is a weak one when compared

1440
01:53:22.28 --> 01:53:28.08
with the actual experience in war it is much more important that peacetime drills be so

1441
01:53:28.08 --> 01:53:33.96
arranged that a part of the causes for friction occur and that the judgment the wisdom the

1442
01:53:33.96 --> 01:53:38.68
prudence and the decision of the individual leaders are tested that is believed by those

1443
01:53:38.68 --> 01:53:43.16
who do not know from this experience so you got to go if you haven't been a war you got

1444
01:53:43.16 --> 01:53:50.40
to go even harder than you think it is of utmost importance that the soldier of high

1445
01:53:50.40 --> 01:53:55.12
or low grade no matter what position he may occupy should experience those difficulties

1446
01:53:55.12 --> 01:54:01.96
which perplex and surprise him in actual war if they have happened to him but once before

1447
01:54:01.96 --> 01:54:07.28
he's already somewhat familiar with them this even applies to physical strains they must

1448
01:54:07.28 --> 01:54:16.96
be practiced not so much that nature but that the brain becomes accustomed this is so absolutely

1449
01:54:16.96 --> 01:54:24.84
critical and you know I was so lucky to have been where I was in and be able to run training

1450
01:54:24.84 --> 01:54:29.68
in the SEAL teams because we just were able to execute on this we are just absolutely

1451
01:54:29.68 --> 01:54:35.80
able to execute on this 100% and give super hard training stressful training decisions

1452
01:54:35.80 --> 01:54:40.04
that need to be made under time under stress under pressure with mayhem going on communication

1453
01:54:40.04 --> 01:54:43.64
breaking down like we're able to do this over and over again if you're a platoon commander

1454
01:54:43.64 --> 01:54:50.28
you're going to do this 12 times in 12 nights or in three nights or four nights you're going

1455
01:54:50.28 --> 01:54:54.08
to be put in these stressful situations you would start to get used to it and your troops

1456
01:54:54.08 --> 01:55:03.36
get used to it this is why law enforcement training needs to step it up yeah needs to

1457
01:55:03.36 --> 01:55:17.52
step it up about a thousand percent so that people get used to these scenarios from training

1458
01:55:17.52 --> 01:55:21.56
the Germans have gone to great trouble and expense to carry out this principle in training

1459
01:55:21.56 --> 01:55:25.44
for one thing troops in training exercises are provided with large amounts of practice

1460
01:55:25.44 --> 01:55:30.12
ammunition of all sorts including grenades usually with reduced charges but nevertheless

1461
01:55:30.12 --> 01:55:34.88
requiring careful handling and involving some risk machine gun fire ball ammunition over

1462
01:55:34.88 --> 01:55:39.68
the heads of attacking troops with very small safety margin and trench mortars support the

1463
01:55:39.68 --> 01:55:45.76
infantry within 50 yards of of its objective a German officer of engineers told an observer

1464
01:55:45.76 --> 01:55:50.72
that we have considerable losses in wartime training but this is unavoidable in familiarizing

1465
01:55:50.72 --> 01:55:55.52
the men in handling of explosives and becoming an expert the men know that losses in training

1466
01:55:55.52 --> 01:56:02.52
would mean fewer losses in battle in field exercise the enemy is always represented by

1467
01:56:02.52 --> 01:56:08.16
actual soldiers who advance in retreat delay flyer fire blanks and otherwise conduct themselves

1468
01:56:08.16 --> 01:56:12.88
at the enemy should barbed wire shell holes trenches artillery emplacements and all the

1469
01:56:12.88 --> 01:56:20.000
other features of actual combat are introduced as far as possible in every exercise remember

1470
01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:27.48
when you guys for training got the laser tag system whatever it's called when you shot

1471
01:56:27.48 --> 01:56:33.28
it was it what did the gunfire was it like it was a blank oh so it was so it sounded

1472
01:56:33.28 --> 01:56:40.08
real well blanks don't sound as real as real guns but yes it went bang yeah and then it

1473
01:56:40.08 --> 01:56:43.40
shot the laser at the same time what's the difference between the sound I don't think

1474
01:56:43.40 --> 01:56:48.36
I've ever heard a blank there's a choir it's it's it's it's considerably choir although

1475
01:56:48.36 --> 01:56:54.92
the machine gun blanks are pretty freaking loud yeah but like a an m4 or m16 type blank

1476
01:56:54.92 --> 01:57:01.64
is pre-week bro like pride on the air pro oh for I mean it's loud but it's not crazy

1477
01:57:01.64 --> 01:57:08.68
yeah yeah you ever watch a snatch movie yeah don't remember too much about it I read you

1478
01:57:08.68 --> 01:57:14.56
anyway they had these replica they're gonna do some robbery oh yeah this is the 50 cal

1479
01:57:14.56 --> 01:57:18.52
that says replica on it right the desert eagle 50 cal that says no no no isn't that in that

1480
01:57:18.52 --> 01:57:23.28
movie though yes but they're close that's not what happened was actually yes so it was

1481
01:57:23.28 --> 01:57:28.84
like the that scene or the part of that scene anyway so they these guys these three thugs

1482
01:57:28.84 --> 01:57:35.000
go and they get these guns that are replica guns he's like I even got extra loud blanks

1483
01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:38.92
so that actually now kind of makes a little bit more sense it's like okay there's extra

1484
01:57:38.92 --> 01:57:44.56
loud blanks well yeah if the if regular blanks are more quiet yeah then that makes sense but

1485
01:57:44.56 --> 01:57:48.12
then even though they're making jokes they're like why in case we got a deaf in them to

1486
01:57:48.12 --> 01:57:52.80
death or whatever yeah you said whatever no so the desert eagle wasn't the replica the

1487
01:57:52.80 --> 01:57:57.88
desert eagle was real oh they had the replicas so they came in they did they did whatever

1488
01:57:57.88 --> 01:58:02.44
they did then they came one of them say replica on it though all their guns all the thugs guns

1489
01:58:02.44 --> 01:58:09.72
so they were pointing it at Vinnie blue or Vinnie's is really bullet tooth Tony who's

1490
01:58:09.72 --> 01:58:14.76
this big played by Vinnie I forget his last name and he's just cruising they're having

1491
01:58:14.76 --> 01:58:19.16
a beer and they're like you know they try to intimidate them or whatever and then Vinnie

1492
01:58:19.16 --> 01:58:23.56
goes into this or bullet tooth goes into this kind of cool speech and then at the end of

1493
01:58:23.56 --> 01:58:28.04
speech it says on the fact that you have a replica written down the side of your guns

1494
01:58:28.04 --> 01:58:32.44
and it kind of zooms you know got rich he has this good cinematic style shows the replica

1495
01:58:32.44 --> 01:58:38.92
of words and then it goes on the fact that I have desert eagle and he pulls it out written

1496
01:58:38.92 --> 01:58:43.24
on mine and then he goes back into his speech or whatever it was just a super good scene

1497
01:58:43.24 --> 01:58:50.84
but the desert eagle is real they had replicas okay you know this guy's talking about barbed

1498
01:58:50.84 --> 01:58:55.84
wire shell holes trenches artillery and placements like all the stuff to make it real we had Hollywood

1499
01:58:55.84 --> 01:59:02.20
set designers come down and square away our training sites and it was freaking awesome

1500
01:59:02.20 --> 01:59:08.44
it was awesome and then like we do what the moose would do which is like set tires on

1501
01:59:08.44 --> 01:59:12.20
fire in the middle of the streets you come down there your night vision is getting all

1502
01:59:12.20 --> 01:59:16.72
messed up from that there's graffiti on the walls there's speakers that are playing the

1503
01:59:16.72 --> 01:59:22.44
call to prayer it would be it would be realistic man yeah and that's so good too because when

1504
01:59:22.44 --> 01:59:26.32
you first started saying that I was like oh wait you got Hollywood set I mean that's kind

1505
01:59:26.32 --> 01:59:31.56
of going is it that deep bro like did you and then but then I thought about it so when

1506
01:59:31.56 --> 01:59:36.28
I first started playing football I was 11 years old Pop Warner football and you know

1507
01:59:36.28 --> 01:59:39.96
in a regular football practice especially back then might be different now but back then

1508
01:59:39.96 --> 01:59:45.24
is you know you warm up you do some exercises pushups and stuff you do like these kind of

1509
01:59:45.24 --> 01:59:49.96
they're called grass drills but they're like essentially coordination drills you know and

1510
01:59:49.96 --> 01:59:54.64
then you do some technique stuff and then you do a scrimmage pretty much every day with

1511
01:59:54.64 --> 02:00:02.32
your pads on too so it's essentially it's essentially full contact scrimmages right

1512
02:00:02.32 --> 02:00:08.08
so but the scrimmage would have and this is pretty this is pretty standard where you have

1513
02:00:08.08 --> 02:00:12.04
like kind of the starting team in the secondary team and then you have everyone else who's

1514
02:00:12.04 --> 02:00:17.48
not on the first or second string plays the defense right but they show the defense that

1515
02:00:17.48 --> 02:00:23.44
the team that we're going to play that week what defense they got it so and then if the

1516
02:00:23.44 --> 02:00:27.64
player and here's what our coaches would do if there was a star player somewhere like

1517
02:00:27.64 --> 02:00:31.84
maybe the defensive end or something like that was a star player the safety or the linebacker

1518
02:00:31.84 --> 02:00:35.28
was this was kind of the star player especially when you're young it kind of it stands out

1519
02:00:35.28 --> 02:00:41.88
more they would get like one of our really good players to play that guy and if he did

1520
02:00:41.88 --> 02:00:46.08
something unique they would make that guy do that unique thing so they try to try to

1521
02:00:46.08 --> 02:00:50.68
make it realistic like and replicate it right so I remember them I remember thinking like

1522
02:00:50.68 --> 02:00:55.64
alright I mean you know we run plays but I didn't realize how much of a difference it

1523
02:00:55.64 --> 02:00:59.92
is from running plays against a generic defense versus running plays against a very specific

1524
02:00:59.92 --> 02:01:05.72
defense so and you know I'm 11 years old so it's not dawning on me right so I'm like

1525
02:01:05.72 --> 02:01:10.80
whatever though what we'll practice or whatever and from week to week you'd be different you

1526
02:01:10.80 --> 02:01:14.44
could feel the difference with who we're playing and they'd all be the same guys guys on our

1527
02:01:14.44 --> 02:01:19.52
team right in practice but rewind back to that first game and the first time you play

1528
02:01:19.52 --> 02:01:24.28
and you see the exact same thing as we were practicing it's different jerseys which is

1529
02:01:24.28 --> 02:01:28.04
weird but even that little detail it's kind of like whoa that kind of stood out you could

1530
02:01:28.04 --> 02:01:32.08
see the little differences like oh I've been used to this practice so much you know over

1531
02:01:32.08 --> 02:01:36.96
these weeks or whatever the littlest difference stands out so the more accurate you can make

1532
02:01:36.96 --> 02:01:42.08
it the better so you don't get distracted by all these little differences right so then

1533
02:01:42.08 --> 02:01:49.04
I thought back to your you know scenario where you're hiring set designers and you're like

1534
02:01:49.04 --> 02:01:52.56
talking about burning tires and doing all this little stuff that I'm like I'm curious

1535
02:01:52.56 --> 02:01:56.72
if there's a burning tire or not you know like probably you're here to do the mission

1536
02:01:56.72 --> 02:02:01.36
the burning tires not gonna distract you the thing is it wouldn't be surprising to me given

1537
02:02:01.36 --> 02:02:06.60
what I already know everything would be distraction if you haven't seen it before the burning

1538
02:02:06.60 --> 02:02:10.16
tire it's kind of like that's kind of a big distraction actually when you think about

1539
02:02:10.16 --> 02:02:14.36
it or it could be yeah yeah how's it affecting your night vision what are you gonna do yeah

1540
02:02:14.36 --> 02:02:20.04
it's a little thing but it makes a big difference it's so true so true even like okay so like

1541
02:02:20.04 --> 02:02:24.24
football there I remember so this guy's name is Kelly is kind of like you know kids are

1542
02:02:24.24 --> 02:02:28.84
bigger yep so they'd replicate him in practice they'd put my brother or something somebody

1543
02:02:28.84 --> 02:02:33.32
there right someone who's just like a like a big a good athlete for practice but this

1544
02:02:33.32 --> 02:02:37.56
guy Kelly he wasn't just a good athlete he was kind of a mean person so it was like you

1545
02:02:37.56 --> 02:02:43.60
could tell the difference between an athlete and being a mean person the difference between

1546
02:02:43.60 --> 02:02:47.40
that you know and it was like a thing is like man they should have told my brother whoever

1547
02:02:47.40 --> 02:02:51.96
else was just to be mean or something like that that would help that little detail would

1548
02:02:51.96 --> 02:02:56.56
help they're a little surprised yeah yeah yeah well I always tell people like I'm doing

1549
02:02:56.56 --> 02:02:59.48
my first jiu-jitsu tournament what should I be ready for and I'm like yeah be ready for

1550
02:02:59.48 --> 02:03:03.56
your opponent to go crazier than anything you've seen in your jiu-jitsu academy yeah that's

1551
02:03:03.56 --> 02:03:07.20
what's gonna happen yeah might not be the first match might be the same but like it's almost

1552
02:03:07.20 --> 02:03:12.24
guaranteed and probably is gonna be your first match person gonna get nuts yeah you ready

1553
02:03:12.24 --> 02:03:15.84
for that yeah and actually there's ways to get ready for that even though it does get

1554
02:03:15.84 --> 02:03:20.24
a little bit more just like yeah ball extra like anything it gets dangerous after a while

1555
02:03:20.24 --> 02:03:25.20
if you start practicing that hard with it you know yeah you can't but to do like an in-house

1556
02:03:25.20 --> 02:03:31.52
tournament or like or a replicated tournament like they did it a few times where it's like

1557
02:03:31.52 --> 02:03:37.60
oh everyone like make a big circle we're gonna do a thing points matter yeah yeah yeah start

1558
02:03:37.60 --> 02:03:41.44
tracking points that's the thing you know and people watching and yelling and cheering

1559
02:03:41.44 --> 02:03:44.84
and they're being a ref counting your points it's kind of like when things matter a little

1560
02:03:44.84 --> 02:03:55.60
bit more it's like right even they saw just psychological but it helps isn't everything

1561
02:03:55.60 --> 02:04:01.60
the handbook on squad combat says one should use real troops as much as possible represent

1562
02:04:01.60 --> 02:04:07.08
the enemy the soldiers will much less will be much less likely to make mistakes in wartime

1563
02:04:07.08 --> 02:04:11.60
if they see during the training instead of a dummy a real and active enemy this is you

1564
02:04:11.60 --> 02:04:15.44
know you talked about using that laser tag system and when we started using simulation

1565
02:04:15.44 --> 02:04:21.64
and paintball it was just totally different I mean imagine that that paper target doesn't

1566
02:04:21.64 --> 02:04:25.44
shoot back it doesn't move that's the main concerns of the enemy they're gonna shoot

1567
02:04:25.44 --> 02:04:31.36
back if they're gonna move a paper target doesn't shoot back it doesn't move so that

1568
02:04:31.36 --> 02:04:35.76
training is even though live fire training you have to do it and you need to do it to

1569
02:04:35.76 --> 02:04:43.60
a point where it's second nature live fire against targets but the real stressors should

1570
02:04:43.60 --> 02:04:52.44
come when you start doing force on force training yeah yeah that's a just the person or the

1571
02:04:52.44 --> 02:04:57.28
enemy whatever shooting back just that not moving thing like what if there was stationary

1572
02:04:57.28 --> 02:05:02.20
targets that actually shot back just that alone huge deal yeah on the flip side just

1573
02:05:02.20 --> 02:05:06.40
them moving around versus number huge deal totally and then I got now you're missing

1574
02:05:06.40 --> 02:05:11.96
in live fire training and this obviously my little theory in the scenario but those two

1575
02:05:11.96 --> 02:05:16.76
put together yeah isn't that kind of night and day it's a whole different training scenario

1576
02:05:16.76 --> 02:05:22.64
and we adjusted our tactics when we figured that out because our tactics had evolved from

1577
02:05:22.64 --> 02:05:29.44
Vietnam they had evolved to a point where they weren't realistic anymore because we

1578
02:05:29.44 --> 02:05:35.32
spent all these we spent 20 years shooting at paper targets that weren't moving and so

1579
02:05:35.32 --> 02:05:41.40
we developed tactics to do it very quickly but it was against inanimate objects the

1580
02:05:41.40 --> 02:05:47.40
minute we started getting paintball and simulation into the game you start realizing oh that's

1581
02:05:47.40 --> 02:05:51.64
not gonna work we can't all stand in a big group like this we need to take this into

1582
02:05:51.64 --> 02:05:56.16
consideration we need to take that into consideration all so things we got a lot better we started

1583
02:05:56.16 --> 02:06:00.24
doing force on force training it's the same thing to be said for jiu-jitsu and UFC right

1584
02:06:00.24 --> 02:06:05.12
when you just when I used to walk up to you and throw like a whatever punch and you would

1585
02:06:05.12 --> 02:06:10.04
fall down like I threw a simulated punch and you simulated falling down and I simulated

1586
02:06:10.04 --> 02:06:15.56
and broke your you know your heart with a with a two finger punch or whatever you know

1587
02:06:15.56 --> 02:06:18.92
what I mean it's called the dimma yeah with the dimma then it's like it seemed to work

1588
02:06:18.92 --> 02:06:24.92
good like I was pretty awesome but then the minute I got into a fight with some drunk

1589
02:06:24.92 --> 02:06:31.08
wrestler I got a beat down I'm like this doesn't work and what jiu-jitsu is jiu-jitsu is like

1590
02:06:31.08 --> 02:06:36.36
oh you're training to you're training as hard as you can to put the person in a submission

1591
02:06:36.36 --> 02:06:40.92
hold that then they don't die because they tap well it's the same thing I shoot you with

1592
02:06:40.92 --> 02:06:46.12
paintball in the neck or the thighs which is where I'm aiming because they are still

1593
02:06:46.12 --> 02:06:53.64
ours so when I shoot you there you don't die but you learn a lesson so how different is

1594
02:06:53.64 --> 02:06:58.80
it you ever played regular paintball yes regular okay so semenition that's the people

1595
02:06:58.80 --> 02:07:04.84
they guys have what's the difference is there any difference with semenition semenition

1596
02:07:04.84 --> 02:07:10.04
you shoot from your real weapon yeah and it and it goes bang it goes it goes bang not loud

1597
02:07:10.04 --> 02:07:14.84
you know it's not it's just a little it's a little tiny bang uh you have to change your

1598
02:07:14.84 --> 02:07:20.20
magazine it's not like we have 400 paintballs and a freaking hopper on top of your gun you just

1599
02:07:20.20 --> 02:07:25.08
lay it away straight you have to change magazine you're they kind of semenition does jam a little

1600
02:07:25.08 --> 02:07:29.80
bit oh which is a bummer what's the um what would you call it the propellant or what

1601
02:07:29.80 --> 02:07:35.16
would it like how does it it's an explosion yeah it's like a little explosion and so and it comes

1602
02:07:35.16 --> 02:07:39.40
out I would I don't know if it comes out like faster it seems to I think it's a little bit

1603
02:07:39.40 --> 02:07:43.64
faster I think it's hits a little bit harder then it's a smaller project also hurts a little bit

1604
02:07:43.64 --> 02:07:48.84
more okay but it but it is it has paint in it and you get you know you get a little paint on you

1605
02:07:49.64 --> 02:07:55.64
and it's very effective it's the thing the reason that we also use the laser tag system

1606
02:07:55.64 --> 02:08:04.76
is because the paintball and the semenition is only good for you know 30 40 yards so it's good in

1607
02:08:04.76 --> 02:08:11.24
the house it's good in the hallway it's good in a cqc environment but out in the field it's no good

1608
02:08:11.24 --> 02:08:16.12
it doesn't work good you can use a little bit like even in a mountain environment you need to use

1609
02:08:16.12 --> 02:08:22.20
regular paintball guns eventually so that you can get some distance you can put down cover fire

1610
02:08:22.20 --> 02:08:28.60
like across the street but even that's not very that's not very accurate you but then but then the

1611
02:08:28.60 --> 02:08:33.64
lasers they're good at like three four five hundred yards well maybe 300 yards but but that's

1612
02:08:33.64 --> 02:08:39.96
that's legit but you can get some legit training and do the laser and this is just my predicting

1613
02:08:39.96 --> 02:08:46.60
or estimating kind of imagining so the one you're with the lasers don't you lose an element of

1614
02:08:46.60 --> 02:08:52.36
stress a little bit because there's nothing actually coming in hitting you yep and what what was funny

1615
02:08:52.36 --> 02:08:58.68
was so we use those in the desert and if you got shot you're gonna get put down and if you got put

1616
02:08:58.68 --> 02:09:03.24
down someone's gonna have to carry you out and if you're getting carried out you're gonna get dropped

1617
02:09:03.24 --> 02:09:10.28
you're gonna get food like it sucks for everyone and so when it would actually when you would watch

1618
02:09:10.28 --> 02:09:15.56
the guys going through like a urban scenario getting shot with paintball they would just charge

1619
02:09:15.56 --> 02:09:19.24
through it like they didn't care like in the structures if they're gonna put you down they put

1620
02:09:19.24 --> 02:09:26.36
you down but when on the laser tag system it had a near miss little you had a speaker on your

1621
02:09:26.36 --> 02:09:31.56
shoulder so when you would get shot at it would go you know make a little noise and you knew that

1622
02:09:31.56 --> 02:09:36.60
you were getting shot at oh that's cool and when you would watch guys as those near misses started

1623
02:09:36.60 --> 02:09:42.68
coming they would dive for cover like they were getting shot at for real i'm not kidding they were

1624
02:09:42.68 --> 02:09:47.64
dying like they were getting shot up for we don't because they if they got shot everything was going

1625
02:09:47.64 --> 02:09:50.92
to go to shit they were gonna get bogged down other people were gonna shot they were gonna have to

1626
02:09:50.92 --> 02:09:58.44
get carried out which is a total gut check and and it would happen a lot but you'd see those guys

1627
02:09:59.16 --> 02:10:05.16
it was very effective training yeah but sometimes you know when you're just doing a laser tag with

1628
02:10:05.16 --> 02:10:10.60
no punishment whatsoever you can definitely get a little bit cocky with paintball you don't really

1629
02:10:10.60 --> 02:10:14.60
get too cocky because it hurts and you don't want to get you know you'll you'll move from cover to

1630
02:10:14.60 --> 02:10:19.96
cover yeah because you don't want to get lit up yeah yeah funny there's all those little details

1631
02:10:19.96 --> 02:10:24.76
that you don't really think about that play such a big role in the whole scenario oh yeah the guys

1632
02:10:24.76 --> 02:10:31.72
diving for cover in we using the laser system was that's when you knew like oh this is really

1633
02:10:31.72 --> 02:10:38.68
effective so and then you could also put down suppressive fire because if you were you know

1634
02:10:38.68 --> 02:10:43.40
over in a building I could just shoot at the building and as soon as you started maneuvering

1635
02:10:43.40 --> 02:10:47.64
out so you could shoot back you'd like get near misses and you'd hide oh yeah so that means I could

1636
02:10:47.64 --> 02:10:52.92
you know I could put down cover fire while my buddy moved yeah and it was totally effective

1637
02:10:53.56 --> 02:10:57.72
that speaker kind of makes a big difference that you know I didn't really think about it where

1638
02:10:57.72 --> 02:11:02.12
especially if you have that association like oh if I get put down this major consequences

1639
02:11:02.12 --> 02:11:05.48
because without the speak because I'm not thinking speaker does all that which obviously

1640
02:11:05.48 --> 02:11:10.36
is more advanced than I thought so the if you're just like oh you only get the indicator that you

1641
02:11:10.36 --> 02:11:14.44
got shot right which is kind of like the regular laser tag yeah that I played when I was young

1642
02:11:14.44 --> 02:11:19.24
you don't they don't know near misses nothing like that so you think oh yeah cover fire won't work

1643
02:11:19.24 --> 02:11:24.52
that good because yeah what basically the whole concept of cover fire is you're being scared of

1644
02:11:24.52 --> 02:11:29.16
those bullets even though they don't hit you but then yeah if you got that speaker buzzing in

1645
02:11:29.16 --> 02:11:38.52
yeah oh but then but laser doesn't like hit the building doesn't because bullet hitting the building

1646
02:11:38.52 --> 02:11:45.88
is like kind of a big thing right that will get your head down yeah so cover fire in a way

1647
02:11:45.88 --> 02:11:54.92
potentially is way more effective in real fire for all because it's everything yes and that was

1648
02:11:54.92 --> 02:12:00.44
one thing that was even with even with the laser tag you'd still see guys do like stuff where you're

1649
02:12:00.44 --> 02:12:08.04
like hey would you have really done that because you got shot 19 times or whatever you know and so

1650
02:12:08.04 --> 02:12:13.72
it was a little hard to simulate the fear of death yeah but I'll tell you what getting getting buddy

1651
02:12:13.72 --> 02:12:19.96
carried or having to buddy carry someone out for six kilometers in the desert on night vision

1652
02:12:19.96 --> 02:12:25.56
it sucked and guys hated it and so they would do everything they could to stay alive and accomplish

1653
02:12:25.56 --> 02:12:32.12
the mission yeah that feels like a solid little like proxy yeah for it it was a solid little

1654
02:12:32.12 --> 02:12:38.76
proxy I mean obviously you can't shoot the guys and kill them right but man it's you don't want to

1655
02:12:38.76 --> 02:12:43.88
hump someone out in the desert it's freaking terrible especially someone like you yeah and in

1656
02:12:43.88 --> 02:12:55.16
and sometimes guys would you know a task unit would have 12 down man it would just be awful

1657
02:12:55.80 --> 02:12:59.96
like if they did if they didn't if the leadership wasn't making good decisions and they weren't

1658
02:12:59.96 --> 02:13:05.24
covered in moving they have things weren't you know simple and clear and they didn't prioritize

1659
02:13:05.24 --> 02:13:09.96
you would get 12 13 14 and sometimes you know we'd kill so many of them they'd be like all right

1660
02:13:09.96 --> 02:13:14.20
you guys are done just walk back you you failed oh that's when you're getting reloaded and now

1661
02:13:14.20 --> 02:13:19.24
you got a whole nother stress right because they don't want to get they don't want to fail of course

1662
02:13:20.20 --> 02:13:26.76
so be a bummer but it was really good it was it was great to be able to be a part of that training

1663
02:13:26.76 --> 02:13:34.60
yeah that's that's cool how it evolved into like that that close to realistic yeah those paintballs

1664
02:13:34.60 --> 02:13:38.20
like especially if that's simulant the mission hurt more than like paintball kind of hurts

1665
02:13:38.20 --> 02:13:42.28
hmm like it's a mission hurts too yeah but i'd say it's probably about the same

1666
02:13:42.84 --> 02:13:46.20
yeah probably about the same but i got whacked like couple times like in the side

1667
02:13:46.76 --> 02:13:51.000
and i wasn't wearing like padding or nothing only just the face one yeah and yeah i get and

1668
02:13:51.000 --> 02:13:56.04
leaves like a straight up wound like on your thing like a little well whatever yeah that's

1669
02:13:56.04 --> 02:13:57.88
something it's not nothing i tell you that

1670
02:13:57.88 --> 02:14:08.60
yeah thoroughness realism in german training methods is one aspect of their general demand

1671
02:14:08.60 --> 02:14:13.48
for thoroughness german officers in particular and the enlisted men as well are taught to regard

1672
02:14:13.48 --> 02:14:18.92
themselves as men engaged in a highly skilled and highly honorable profession and to take pride in

1673
02:14:18.92 --> 02:14:24.60
acquiring the details of military techniques to encourage this point of view soldiers are put as

1674
02:14:24.60 --> 02:14:34.68
little as possible on fatigue work and non-military labors which are performed by civilians and the

1675
02:14:34.68 --> 02:14:39.88
last thing we'll talk about from this document is marksmanship journey german training has tended

1676
02:14:39.88 --> 02:14:44.52
to put emphasis on volume of fire rather than accuracy an observer believes that their ability

1677
02:14:44.52 --> 02:14:49.72
to concentrate fire at vital point is superior to our own but that their standards of markmanship

1678
02:14:49.72 --> 02:14:55.56
are inferior however a german article in late 1941 makes the point that volume of mechanical fire

1679
02:14:55.56 --> 02:15:00.76
will not replace accurate individual shooting and that sharp shooters can perform invaluable

1680
02:15:01.56 --> 02:15:12.92
tactical missions so they they did concentrate on volume of fire and they concentrate on marksmanship

1681
02:15:12.92 --> 02:15:21.40
the basic skills of shooting and there you have it and and as you can see many of those principles

1682
02:15:23.56 --> 02:15:27.48
are the same principles that are taught in the u.s military and really the same principles that

1683
02:15:27.48 --> 02:15:36.68
are taught by any sort of leadership education right and and that's why it's very strange to

1684
02:15:36.68 --> 02:15:45.72
read this document and recognize that these principles are being utilized by the most evil

1685
02:15:45.72 --> 02:15:53.64
or at least one of the top evil empires to have ever existed and yet they're talking about taking

1686
02:15:53.64 --> 02:16:00.52
care of their people and and making sure everyone understands the why and you can see as i mentioned

1687
02:16:00.52 --> 02:16:06.52
earlier that that while these principles were implemented down the chain of command clearly at

1688
02:16:06.52 --> 02:16:13.96
the top these principles didn't exist at all the tyrannical leader of hitler massive ego driven by

1689
02:16:13.96 --> 02:16:21.16
his own insecurities driven by paranoia lack of trust like all these things that these book this

1690
02:16:21.16 --> 02:16:31.08
book talks about the hitler didn't have and that's why you end up in this disaster and this horrific

1691
02:16:32.28 --> 02:16:38.36
the the horrific atrocities that that the nazis created in the horrific atrocities of the war

1692
02:16:39.48 --> 02:16:43.56
which which you know what you you know you were talking about earlier i kind of made funny you

1693
02:16:43.56 --> 02:16:52.60
about like oh the world didn't exist before i was here right it's it's kind of inconceivable in some

1694
02:16:52.60 --> 02:17:03.64
ways to understand the broad absolute horror of world war two and the holocaust and the the deaths

1695
02:17:03.64 --> 02:17:19.08
the the woundings the loss of life the destroyed communities it's it's it's kind of hard to really

1696
02:17:19.08 --> 02:17:26.36
truly understand that those things occurred at all it can be very bit difficult to understand that

1697
02:17:27.24 --> 02:17:33.08
they seem inconceivable i guess if you truly look at it season it seems inconceivable if you think

1698
02:17:33.08 --> 02:17:43.16
about the millions of people you know millions of people millions of people dying it's hard to

1699
02:17:43.16 --> 02:17:48.60
it's hard to understand a million dollars it's hard to understand you know a million a million

1700
02:17:48.60 --> 02:17:54.20
people going to a you know at a at a big giant arena there's only a hundred thousand people there

1701
02:17:55.88 --> 02:17:57.000
picture that times 10

1702
02:17:57.000 --> 02:18:06.36
and then that's there you have a million and each one of those people is an individual with a family

1703
02:18:06.36 --> 02:18:13.64
and dreams and a life and and and thoughts and when you start talking about the scale of death

1704
02:18:13.64 --> 02:18:21.16
and destruction in world war two it's just it's hard to conceive what that really means but

1705
02:18:21.16 --> 02:18:31.24
it did happen and we have to study history and have to study our enemies and what their

1706
02:18:31.24 --> 02:18:37.48
fault processes were to make sure that history does not repeat itself

1707
02:18:41.88 --> 02:18:47.72
with that we appreciate y'all listen to the podcast if you want to support the podcast

1708
02:18:47.72 --> 02:18:53.16
and support yourself at the same time might as well support some good causes out there right

1709
02:18:53.16 --> 02:18:57.24
let's support some good it's true let's make the world a better place let's start with ourselves

1710
02:18:57.24 --> 02:19:08.12
yes make yourself better physically better mentally better spiritually better let's do all those

1711
02:19:08.12 --> 02:19:14.44
things yep it's true take care of yourself on every front that's what we need to do and then you

1712
02:19:14.44 --> 02:19:18.68
can take care of other people then you can help other people so if you want to help yourself from a

1713
02:19:19.40 --> 02:19:25.56
fuel and i'm not talking about gasoline for your car or maybe diesel for your truck i'm talking about

1714
02:19:25.56 --> 02:19:31.32
for you you need fuel similar concept similar concept you want to get good fuel you kind of

1715
02:19:31.32 --> 02:19:36.60
want to get the best fuel yes you might want to get for yourself some jockel fuel it's true

1716
02:19:37.24 --> 02:19:43.56
yeah it's very true you know as i keep reminding you off air that i am on the path kind of strict

1717
02:19:43.56 --> 02:19:54.44
oh yeah yeah i'm kind of legitimately strict ever since um covid started i put on some pounds

1718
02:19:54.44 --> 02:20:01.88
some good some bad and uh you know varying levels of success in going back to you know

1719
02:20:01.88 --> 02:20:07.08
to where i was before that also i just got back from the motherland why you know and you know that

1720
02:20:07.08 --> 02:20:13.24
can go sometimes but nonetheless point is i'm on the path so routine back in full swing

1721
02:20:13.24 --> 02:20:20.44
100 percent bro covid was like three years ago yes sir yeah yeah you know like i said

1722
02:20:21.48 --> 02:20:25.88
let's make a regular don't go off the path for three years everybody i would say this so i was

1723
02:20:25.88 --> 02:20:31.08
two years it's coming up on three years maybe two years two years two and a half i don't know

1724
02:20:31.08 --> 02:20:35.72
something like that but i was like i'm off the path because of covid well you know two and a half

1725
02:20:35.72 --> 02:20:43.000
years ago well jiu-jitsu stops for a long time the routine jiu-jitsu okay we got little pockets

1726
02:20:43.000 --> 02:20:47.88
here and there and get in this is true but the routine stops you know i still can work out at

1727
02:20:47.88 --> 02:20:53.72
the house or whatever but cardio goes way down sometimes like off the grid let's face it so i'm

1728
02:20:53.72 --> 02:21:00.12
just lifting some boom i'm putting myself on full report maybe someone else out there can relate to

1729
02:21:00.12 --> 02:21:05.80
the realities of situations like this nonetheless boom yeah sure i got back on the path but i never

1730
02:21:05.80 --> 02:21:10.68
really got back to where it was and after a while you know we just got tired of that one you know

1731
02:21:10.68 --> 02:21:16.04
so we just went more strict right i'm saying but there are certain elements in there that have

1732
02:21:16.04 --> 02:21:22.76
always been on the path especially with the fuel with the jockel fuel part of it part of the point

1733
02:21:22.76 --> 02:21:28.60
as well so thank god you had jockel fuel because apparently you need you were just you were just

1734
02:21:28.60 --> 02:21:33.08
walking around never mind off the path you're off the reservation no i know and the way i'm

1735
02:21:33.08 --> 02:21:41.56
putting is more like i just freaking just let myself go i didn't let myself go but i put on like a good

1736
02:21:41.56 --> 02:21:47.56
10 15 pounds which isn't yeah i know it's not like night night and day kind of a scenario but

1737
02:21:48.60 --> 02:21:53.24
and that's probably why i didn't get back right away because it wasn't like that big of a thing

1738
02:21:53.24 --> 02:21:58.84
but it was still a nagging thing i feel like you see i'm saying you're drinking moch i'm drinking

1739
02:21:58.84 --> 02:22:04.28
moch yes and actually i just got on this um protocol which i always knew about but you know

1740
02:22:04.28 --> 02:22:08.44
sometimes it takes a little bit for to implement where if you if with your diet if you just control

1741
02:22:08.44 --> 02:22:13.72
for like the protein get enough protein whatever your workout program kind of requires or whatever

1742
02:22:14.84 --> 02:22:19.64
and then you fill in the rest of the macros accordingly depends on where you want to go

1743
02:22:19.64 --> 02:22:26.52
what your goal is or whatever that's like a really good way to stay on it see i'm saying like if

1744
02:22:26.52 --> 02:22:29.96
because if you don't control for protein and you don't get enough protein you don't build your

1745
02:22:29.96 --> 02:22:33.16
muscle the way you want to do it you risk over training you do all the stuff whatever

1746
02:22:33.16 --> 02:22:37.96
nonetheless it's a better it's a good way to do it yeah so you gotta get that protein yeah 100

1747
02:22:37.96 --> 02:22:46.52
percent how much are you getting oh hot long gram per no like 0.6 0.6 grams per yeah

1748
02:22:47.96 --> 02:22:53.64
but that's like you need to up it man yeah you up those numbers from what i understand i mean i wonder

1749
02:22:53.64 --> 02:22:57.24
you're losing weight you're starving to death over there right you're losing muscle mass no

1750
02:22:58.28 --> 02:23:02.92
no it depends on where what you read and where you read it um that it's going to go anywhere from

1751
02:23:02.92 --> 02:23:12.04
like 0.5 all up to like one oh is per pound per hour per pound or per kilogram no per pound

1752
02:23:13.48 --> 02:23:21.000
for real yeah okay it depends so um i don't know hey look that's that's your journey to look into

1753
02:23:21.000 --> 02:23:28.04
that kind of stuff and figure out what's right for you brought okay so let's say i weigh 220

1754
02:23:29.000 --> 02:23:34.36
and i'm taking what you want me to freaking eat 220 grams of protein in a day that's what you're

1755
02:23:34.36 --> 02:23:41.88
saying i don't know that's 10 mocs i love moc i like moca a lot but i could you know 10 10 yeah

1756
02:23:42.52 --> 02:23:48.68
even if you break it up three milkshakes per meal i don't know i don't know okay we don't

1757
02:23:48.68 --> 02:23:52.36
recommend that i'm not saying yes i'm not saying no i'm saying i don't know that's a little much

1758
02:23:52.36 --> 02:23:57.96
currently i'm not at 10 no i'm at one sometimes two actually but mine are doubles yes or mine

1759
02:23:57.96 --> 02:24:04.92
yeah i only have doubles okay yeah there you go boom nonetheless we're on the program 100

1760
02:24:04.92 --> 02:24:11.56
percent check um also good news with the energy drinks if you didn't know already yeah real good

1761
02:24:11.56 --> 02:24:18.44
news all the old good news is still there healthy for your energy drink no sugar sugar is more

1762
02:24:18.44 --> 02:24:23.16
evil than you think by the way yeah 100 i think it's evil so you're not catching me on that one

1763
02:24:23.16 --> 02:24:28.12
i know as evil as if you were to you know how like i'm sure there was some point in your life where

1764
02:24:28.12 --> 02:24:33.32
you like looked into sugar a little bit deeper than maybe you do daily and then realize oh shoot

1765
02:24:33.32 --> 02:24:38.52
this is kind of there's some issues with sugar sugar is like evil you could start looking back

1766
02:24:38.52 --> 02:24:43.08
into it and probably find some more stuff yeah that's how so you're saying it is even more evil

1767
02:24:43.08 --> 02:24:49.64
than even i thought and i thought it was pretty damn evil that is my contention yes and good news

1768
02:24:49.64 --> 02:24:53.56
like i said old good news but good news and no sugar in this one it's all healthy stuff

1769
02:24:55.24 --> 02:25:00.36
so boom that's still the case but the additional good news we got a reformulated taste for all

1770
02:25:00.36 --> 02:25:07.000
of them oh yeah all of them all the all the discipline go taste good as a hell now like it

1806
02:28:28.92 --> 02:28:35.16
couple objections over a couple of objections they the the conceptual element behind them might have

1807
02:28:35.16 --> 02:28:41.000
went over some people's heads or maybe hit them too hard or hit too hard in the face yeah a little
