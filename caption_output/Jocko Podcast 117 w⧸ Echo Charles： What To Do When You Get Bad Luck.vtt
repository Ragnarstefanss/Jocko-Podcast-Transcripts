00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.64
This is Jockel podcast number 117 with echo Charles and me, Jockel willing. Good evening, I go. Good evening.

2
00:00:08.64 --> 00:00:12.88
And we're doing a Q&A tonight first one in a while.

3
00:00:12.88 --> 00:00:19.92
I've had a bunch of other guests and books and whatnot. So Q&A. Let's go.

4
00:00:19.92 --> 00:00:26.76
Cool. First question. Jockel from 115 podcast number 115 as a leader.

5
00:00:26.76 --> 00:00:33.000
How best to respond to someone like Corporal Meyer when he brings up good questions in a brief

6
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.44
that need to be addressed without derailing the brief and calling your

7
00:00:37.44 --> 00:00:40.92
Competence slash authority into question.

8
00:00:40.92 --> 00:00:47.32
Okay. So what he's talking about is on podcast 115 with Dakota Meyer, which if you haven't

9
00:00:47.32 --> 00:00:54.04
listened to it, listen to it. It's long and it's very, I don't know. It's it's awesome.

10
00:00:54.04 --> 00:01:01.40
Anyways, it part of that podcast Dakota is getting told how they're going to conduct this

11
00:01:01.40 --> 00:01:05.08
operation and Dakota raises some point and says, what about this, what about that, and

12
00:01:05.08 --> 00:01:10.84
what about this other thing? And they don't listen to it. And so the question here is, if

13
00:01:10.84 --> 00:01:15.24
you're in charge, you're the leader and you get someone that brings up these questions

14
00:01:15.24 --> 00:01:20.68
during a brief during the plan that you need to be that need to be addressed. How do you do

15
00:01:20.68 --> 00:01:26.04
it? How do you handle that, probably? Okay. Well, first of all, and the most important part of this,

16
00:01:26.04 --> 00:01:30.68
is if you involve your team in the planning itself, you won't have these questions come up

17
00:01:30.68 --> 00:01:36.28
during the brief. They'll come up during the planning. So that's the ultimate and best way to

18
00:01:36.28 --> 00:01:40.92
solve this problem. You don't plan in a vacuum as the leader and then present the plan to the

19
00:01:40.92 --> 00:01:45.000
troops and expect that you're going to have the perfect plan. You did, it was only your brain

20
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
working on it. What about everyone else's brain? What about everyone else's perspective? They have

21
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.84
experience and they have knowledge that you don't have. So if you involve them in the planning,

22
00:01:54.84 --> 00:01:59.72
then they ask you those questions early and you figure out what the rights answers to those questions

23
00:01:59.72 --> 00:02:06.36
are. So that's how you solve the problem right there. Now, if it happens that for whatever reason

24
00:02:06.36 --> 00:02:10.60
you didn't have the opportunity to do that or you didn't do it well enough for whatever the case

25
00:02:10.60 --> 00:02:17.32
may be. And now you start getting questions on your plan while you're briefing. Well, first of all,

26
00:02:17.32 --> 00:02:24.44
if they ask you questions that you don't have answers to, then that could indicate that you're wrong

27
00:02:24.44 --> 00:02:31.80
actually. You could actually be wrong and not a lot of leaders like to feel that way, but you should

28
00:02:31.80 --> 00:02:36.20
actually be happy that someone on your team is pointing out something that is going to make the plan

29
00:02:36.20 --> 00:02:43.32
better as a whole. So there's that and it's really easy. If someone, if you're in a brief and someone

30
00:02:43.32 --> 00:02:47.96
brings up a point that you didn't think of and it makes sense, well, then you can implement that

31
00:02:47.96 --> 00:02:57.24
into the plan. Okay, so that now you might think that it hurts your authority. Right to say,

32
00:02:57.24 --> 00:03:02.20
hey, that's a good point, Echo. I didn't think of that. Let's implement. You might think or feel like

33
00:03:02.20 --> 00:03:06.52
that's going to make you look bad, but the opposite is actually true. If I go no Echo,

34
00:03:06.52 --> 00:03:10.52
hey, the plan's already completed. You weren't there for the planning, so just be quiet. That's the

35
00:03:10.52 --> 00:03:15.96
guy that no one respects. That's the guy that's not looking good as a leader. That's the person that's

36
00:03:15.96 --> 00:03:19.32
losing authority. So you don't look weak if you listen to members of the team, whether they're

37
00:03:19.32 --> 00:03:28.92
junior or senior. It also shows that you're incompetent if you because you miss the part, obviously

38
00:03:28.92 --> 00:03:33.88
the question is pertinent that they asked or I should say if the question is pertinent and it is a

39
00:03:33.88 --> 00:03:42.68
good point that it shows that you miss an important angle of the plan. So open your mind, open your

40
00:03:42.68 --> 00:03:48.76
put your ego in check and incorporate it in there. Now, this can also happen. If there's something

41
00:03:48.76 --> 00:03:54.76
that you know that you're right on, but something that you know that you're right on. If there's

42
00:03:54.76 --> 00:04:00.12
something like that and you and this, you know, maybe you get one particular individual that's

43
00:04:00.12 --> 00:04:06.84
keeps pushing back and keeps pushing back and you might have to in those cases say, you know what?

44
00:04:06.84 --> 00:04:11.64
Hey, Echo, let me talk to you after this brief is over and I'll explain to you exactly what we're doing

45
00:04:11.64 --> 00:04:16.52
it this way. So that way doesn't derail the brief because it might take a longer explanation than you

46
00:04:16.52 --> 00:04:22.76
want to, you know, for instance, the typical seal briefing was we try to keep it 50 minutes to an hour.

47
00:04:22.76 --> 00:04:28.12
So if you're got to spend eight minutes pulling up a different map and explaining some detail of

48
00:04:28.12 --> 00:04:32.28
the terrain to this guy that has a protest to what you're saying, you might say, hey, listen,

49
00:04:32.28 --> 00:04:35.72
when you get done with this brief, I'll pull you side. Let me show you the terrain map and you can

50
00:04:35.72 --> 00:04:42.52
see exactly why we're using this insertion router. Whatever the case may be. So you can do that if you have to

51
00:04:43.16 --> 00:04:46.84
and even then they might end up having a point that you didn't see and then you can say, okay,

52
00:04:46.84 --> 00:04:52.20
well, I didn't see that. Now we have to give everyone a quick, a rebreafing on some change in the

53
00:04:52.20 --> 00:04:58.36
plan. But again, none of this will happen if you bring your subordinates in and you let them

54
00:04:59.96 --> 00:05:04.28
first of all, let them do the planning. That's ideal. Let them come up with plan. I let echo come up with

55
00:05:04.28 --> 00:05:07.80
the plan. I'm not coming up with the plan. You go come up with the plan. I'm going to check with you and

56
00:05:07.80 --> 00:05:11.32
make sure that the plan is going in the right direction. Make sure it's not totally off track.

57
00:05:12.76 --> 00:05:17.56
And then you'll incorporate all these things and I'll have a better view of the plan. I can

58
00:05:17.56 --> 00:05:21.48
stand back and be the tactical genius as we talk about the book history of ownership. Like that's

59
00:05:21.48 --> 00:05:31.72
how you do it. So that's the answer. Well, at least is an answer. Yeah. Maybe other people have other

60
00:05:31.72 --> 00:05:37.64
answers. Seems to make sense to me. Yeah, that's that hard. It's hard, right? When you, when you,

61
00:05:38.60 --> 00:05:42.92
it's one of the things you always got to be conscious of when you have a plan or whatever. And

62
00:05:44.28 --> 00:05:49.000
someone for lack of better term poke souls in it. And be like, hey, what about this? What about this?

63
00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.80
And then you have those two elements that you got to keep in mind where it's like the fact that

64
00:05:53.80 --> 00:05:58.28
it's your plan and then the plan, you know, the effectiveness of your emotional attachment to the

65
00:05:58.28 --> 00:06:02.68
plan. Yeah. Yeah. You got to keep the emotional attachment to the plan. In Jack versus the

66
00:06:03.56 --> 00:06:07.72
actual effectiveness of the plan. Yeah. And people have a hard time doing that. And what's cool.

67
00:06:07.72 --> 00:06:12.44
What's cool is once you break away from that mindset, then it's really easy. Yeah. Just to be

68
00:06:12.44 --> 00:06:16.20
and everyone just kind of knows. Oh, yeah. Jockels. He's got an overmind. It wasn't to

69
00:06:16.20 --> 00:06:21.000
get as opposed to someone that has a closed mind, everyone goes, oh, you can't, you can't get anything

70
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.48
by this guy. Yeah. You just, he's going to keep. He doesn't even help to point things out because

71
00:06:25.48 --> 00:06:31.24
he won't listen. And then guess what? You're using one brain versus 20 brains. And more important

72
00:06:31.24 --> 00:06:35.56
than the brain power, the perspective, the different perspective. Because the guys in the ground,

73
00:06:35.56 --> 00:06:39.16
the guys with the technical knowledge and the tactical knowledge, they're going to know things

74
00:06:39.16 --> 00:06:46.04
that you don't know. That's the way it is. You can't know everything that they know. And so if you

75
00:06:46.04 --> 00:06:50.52
shut down all those different perspectives, you're looking at something from one angle. You know.

76
00:06:50.52 --> 00:06:54.60
Do you see the whole complete picture when you only look at something from one angle? No, you don't

77
00:06:54.60 --> 00:07:02.04
know, sir. Use those other perspectives. You know, check self-correcting machine. Yeah.

78
00:07:02.04 --> 00:07:07.16
You can let go of the ego, the taking it personal. Well, personal. When I was in the seal

79
00:07:07.16 --> 00:07:10.84
teams, I called it the emotional attachment to the plan. Yeah. Because I see these people come up with

80
00:07:10.84 --> 00:07:15.16
plans and they would be so addicted to their own plan, only because it was their own plan. Not for

81
00:07:15.16 --> 00:07:19.48
any, not for any tactical strategic or operational reason whatsoever. Yeah. Yeah. They just like

82
00:07:19.48 --> 00:07:24.84
the because they thought of it. Yeah. That's natural. Yeah. It's very natural. Yeah. And there's some

83
00:07:24.84 --> 00:07:30.36
element of benefit to that, right? Because if you're passionate about your plan and I'm passionate

84
00:07:30.36 --> 00:07:36.20
about my plan as long as we can eventually come to compromise, then we've put forth the best idea.

85
00:07:36.20 --> 00:07:39.48
Because I don't want you to not be passionate about your plan while you're planning it. I want you

86
00:07:39.48 --> 00:07:43.72
really to come up with the best plan that you really believe in. And it's interesting. You know,

87
00:07:43.72 --> 00:07:48.76
you talk about poking holes, right? Poking holes in the plan. And we all know that it's very

88
00:07:48.76 --> 00:07:54.76
easy to sit back and poke holes. Oh, yeah. And what I'm telling you to do as a leader is to absolutely

89
00:07:54.76 --> 00:08:00.20
do that. Not be a jerk. No, no, and I'm talking as a leader. If I, if I let you do the planning,

90
00:08:00.20 --> 00:08:04.60
then it's easy for me to sit back and poke holes in the plan, which is good. It's good because

91
00:08:04.60 --> 00:08:07.72
we're going to come up with, we're going to fill those holes. Once I poke the holes, we're going

92
00:08:07.72 --> 00:08:11.64
to fill them. They're going to know that they're taking care of. Also, as a leader from a,

93
00:08:11.64 --> 00:08:16.76
from a perspective point, you think, hey, Jockle really knows what's going on. He was able to

94
00:08:16.76 --> 00:08:22.12
find these holes in the plan. The real reason I was able to find him is just because I was not totally

95
00:08:23.96 --> 00:08:31.24
at at minuscule detail with the plan. You were, I was up at altitude relaxing looking around.

96
00:08:31.24 --> 00:08:36.52
Yeah, it's kind of, I don't want to say cheating. But you know, cheating. Yeah, it's cheating.

97
00:08:36.52 --> 00:08:40.76
You're cheating. It's that much easier. It's so much easier to sit back and do it.

98
00:08:40.76 --> 00:08:44.84
Yeah, and let things go that way. Like when you know when you watch a movie and you have like

99
00:08:44.84 --> 00:08:49.72
some critique, the movies outstanding and then you have some critique, I had to show that guy for

100
00:08:49.72 --> 00:08:54.44
that role or whatever. Meanwhile, the movies like ground breaking, whatever. You know, so it's easy

101
00:08:54.44 --> 00:09:00.04
to poke holes in the movie. Meanwhile, like, yeah, when it's done, you're all like poking holes

102
00:09:00.04 --> 00:09:05.40
up the little imperfections. Do that all the time. Make sense. They dig it. Is that happening with your

103
00:09:05.40 --> 00:09:16.76
videos? Is that what they're saying? Probably. In your way. Next question. We have been training

104
00:09:16.76 --> 00:09:23.16
due to for two months now. We started actually rolling a few weeks ago for my knees on the

105
00:09:23.16 --> 00:09:30.60
mat, like not starting from standing. I've trained for an executed multi, oh, I've trained for

106
00:09:30.60 --> 00:09:35.88
and executed multiple marathons, competed, completed a number of tough motors, trained hard and

107
00:09:35.88 --> 00:09:41.48
crossfit, hiked, biked, so I am. And nothing compares to the total mental and physical exhaustion.

108
00:09:41.48 --> 00:09:50.28
I feel after training due to it's how can I combat this? Time. Train more supplements. Just suck it up.

109
00:09:51.56 --> 00:09:55.32
When I get home, I'm so beat in the next morning. I wake up feeling like I was hit by a boss.

110
00:09:55.32 --> 00:10:00.44
I'm dying on that feeling. This might be exhaustion and still sucking at it. It's

111
00:10:00.44 --> 00:10:08.04
super fun. Okay. So that's the GG2. That's it. Okay. So there's a couple of things here. Yes, it's going

112
00:10:08.04 --> 00:10:12.28
to take some time. You're going to have to train. You train more. Your body will become condition to it.

113
00:10:12.28 --> 00:10:19.48
That's probably number one. Number two is, and this is so hard for people to do. Relax.

114
00:10:20.28 --> 00:10:24.84
It's really hard. It's really hard for people to do, especially when you first start out.

115
00:10:24.84 --> 00:10:30.76
I realize that the way you get to a point when you start to relax

116
00:10:32.84 --> 00:10:39.32
is when the capability of your technique surpasses the capability of your strength.

117
00:10:40.36 --> 00:10:44.04
So if I know that I can escape your

118
00:10:45.80 --> 00:10:52.76
choke attempt by holding your hand and pulling your thumb and pulling your arm off, and that's what I know.

119
00:10:52.76 --> 00:10:58.36
That's what I'm going to do. When I realize that I can use a technical escape of swimming my

120
00:10:58.36 --> 00:11:02.76
arm in and then placing my hips on the ground and then scooting away from your choke,

121
00:11:02.76 --> 00:11:09.72
I'll do that instead. But until we figure out the techniques, all we have is muscle. So

122
00:11:10.28 --> 00:11:17.40
the way you do is you just have to keep training and you can train. Can people actually when they

123
00:11:17.40 --> 00:11:23.24
try and relax do they actually get you tell me. So I always tell people like relax more. Like

124
00:11:23.24 --> 00:11:33.40
someone will say I just can't relax. I'll be like relax harder. But it's so hard for people to

125
00:11:33.40 --> 00:11:38.76
relax because people say oh when I relax I just get submitted. Yeah. Right. Yeah. So but if you

126
00:11:38.76 --> 00:11:44.36
relax you'll at least be aware of what's happening. And if you relax you can think about the

127
00:11:44.36 --> 00:11:54.04
technical movement that you're supposed to do to escape. Yeah. Yeah. I feel like just like how you

128
00:11:54.04 --> 00:12:00.28
sit though. If you don't know the move you're just going to go with what you know and it's going to

129
00:12:00.28 --> 00:12:06.04
be the spas in one way or another. If you if you guys on you it's like a never effective.

130
00:12:07.80 --> 00:12:13.48
Because I'll I'll go and say yes. Yes. Sometimes I have to spas and it Dean calls me out on that

131
00:12:13.48 --> 00:12:17.16
a lot. Well here's the thing. You're a good defense. You're just spashing. Well but you're spashing.

132
00:12:17.16 --> 00:12:23.32
There has a big more than a sprinkle of technique and that's the thing. If true. Like you

133
00:12:23.32 --> 00:12:26.68
and I told you this one time you know how like if you say yeah you're strong and that's kind of an

134
00:12:26.68 --> 00:12:30.92
insult in due to because like saying yeah you're strong but you don't have technique it's kind of like

135
00:12:30.92 --> 00:12:34.92
that's what you're in playing. But and I said this to you one time I was like you have like strength

136
00:12:34.92 --> 00:12:41.08
you're strong and you were like not defensive but you were like no I have technique or whatever and

137
00:12:41.08 --> 00:12:46.76
I was like yeah I know that I was like shoot that sounded bad. I mean you have technique. We

138
00:12:46.76 --> 00:12:51.40
already know that. You've been training for 25 million years and you have good technique but with

139
00:12:51.40 --> 00:12:57.32
that technique is like a lot of strength in there. Like when you um there's like stuff oh yeah

140
00:12:57.32 --> 00:13:02.68
when like if you if all be inside control on on top on you and you have this like first of your

141
00:13:02.68 --> 00:13:08.20
hands are in the correct spot just to be in with. That's to be and you can just kind of get your

142
00:13:08.20 --> 00:13:14.28
leg and real easy every single time. Like I can't stop it stop it and I'm not weak. I'm not weak

143
00:13:14.28 --> 00:13:19.24
but it's like the strength of that move is it. It's unstoppable and that's what I said it. I was like

144
00:13:19.24 --> 00:13:24.04
you're like strong when you do a technique it's like it's a strong technique. Yeah and I would say

145
00:13:24.04 --> 00:13:30.68
though there's a lot of oh I would say it's probably 70% technique and 30% strength. Which which may

146
00:13:30.68 --> 00:13:37.32
confirm what you're saying. That 30% strength is still more than if someone has 70% technique

147
00:13:37.32 --> 00:13:44.12
but they have only 10% strength to get back it up. Yeah fully and even saying it's you know

148
00:13:44.12 --> 00:13:50.20
70% technique 30% strength. I mean that's going to vary from time from moment to moment or experience

149
00:13:50.20 --> 00:13:55.24
history. So if you're spashing even that's going to be a spectrum like how much strength

150
00:13:55.24 --> 00:13:58.68
do you use this technique kind of thing? That's because you can't spell for a long time. No

151
00:13:58.68 --> 00:14:03.48
you can use it. You can use it. You can use it. You can use it. Yeah. So when I say you're strong

152
00:14:03.48 --> 00:14:07.40
here's the thing the fact is you're strong regardless of your your technique or not you can live a lot

153
00:14:07.40 --> 00:14:13.08
of ways your big trigrab like I'll grab your wrist and when you break the grip of the wrist it's

154
00:14:13.08 --> 00:14:18.52
way more violent than the typical person. You're strong person. So there's no denying that I know it

155
00:14:18.52 --> 00:14:24.36
sounds like an insult to it but nonetheless back to the point. Yeah so if you if you have strength

156
00:14:24.36 --> 00:14:28.84
going in before you gain all that technique over the or the years just like how you said that's

157
00:14:28.84 --> 00:14:37.24
what you're going to use. So the key is here I think is to consciously and it's not easy.

158
00:14:37.24 --> 00:14:41.64
Consciously focus on the technique. Consciously like remember okay where am I? I mean half guard right

159
00:14:41.64 --> 00:14:45.64
now because you know all like in the beginning when you first learn the the positions you're like

160
00:14:45.64 --> 00:14:50.44
half guard is real clear guard is real clear. When you start rolling around your halfway upside down

161
00:14:50.44 --> 00:14:55.24
maybe your twisting maybe your arms in the wrong spot across your body so like you kind of don't

162
00:14:55.24 --> 00:15:01.08
remember oh wait I'm in half guard right now or I'm upside down but I'm in you know I'm on his back

163
00:15:01.08 --> 00:15:07.48
still or whatever so you don't it doesn't just stick in your mind what position you're in but if you can

164
00:15:07.48 --> 00:15:12.12
do that then it starts getting getting routine so now after that you can figure out okay my

165
00:15:12.12 --> 00:15:16.92
safe here because that's why you spas that's why you you can't relax because you don't know if you're

166
00:15:16.92 --> 00:15:21.56
safe or not so you're just trying to move and get out of there or you know get that's a mission

167
00:15:21.56 --> 00:15:26.60
hurry up before he does something you know where the supplies to life this applies to life

168
00:15:26.60 --> 00:15:33.56
in when you're interacting with other people and you start to let's say you and I are having

169
00:15:33.56 --> 00:15:39.80
a disagreement about something right and you start getting the upper hand on me

170
00:15:40.68 --> 00:15:46.76
and instead of me trying to use a technique to get out all I do is go let's do Brideco you're

171
00:15:46.76 --> 00:15:51.40
done or something right I just are interrupting you're cutting off raising my voice I'm actually losing

172
00:15:51.40 --> 00:16:00.36
now and I don't you know but I'm relying on brute force as opposed to technique now it could

173
00:16:00.36 --> 00:16:06.12
be also like we talked about earlier could be that I'm wrong and if instead of admitting that I'm wrong

174
00:16:06.12 --> 00:16:11.16
or or taking like you're saying relax and looking at the technique and saying you know what echo

175
00:16:11.16 --> 00:16:17.48
has a point here that I can't debate against he's right and I'm wrong I need to admit that same

176
00:16:17.48 --> 00:16:21.64
thing if you came up with an idea for the plan and your idea was better than mine or you had

177
00:16:21.64 --> 00:16:28.20
a point that I needed to bring into the plan unless I unless I can relax and actually pay attention

178
00:16:28.20 --> 00:16:33.16
then I'm not going to be able to do that so that's how well that's one of the many ways when I

179
00:16:33.16 --> 00:16:39.000
always talk about GJ2 applying to life this is another example of where hey if the argument starts

180
00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:44.20
to escalate and you're using brute force to get out of it you're not winning just like you're not

181
00:16:44.20 --> 00:16:50.76
winning in GJ2 it's you're gonna gas out you're gonna lose yeah don't use brute force yeah

182
00:16:51.56 --> 00:16:57.64
yeah not even 30% well maybe sometimes 30% okay the other thing is the other thing that's hard

183
00:16:57.64 --> 00:17:04.12
and it's well it's it's attached to what you're saying don't have death matches every time

184
00:17:04.12 --> 00:17:09.48
yeah right don't it like you find a partner and just be like okay let's try and make sure that

185
00:17:09.48 --> 00:17:16.36
we're not using so much strength I can roll with you or with Dean or with Andy or whoever

186
00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:24.60
for a long time and it's you know we're sweating or tired but we're not using all this strength

187
00:17:24.60 --> 00:17:29.48
we're not walking off the mat with a with with a burned-out muscles yeah it's a different it's more

188
00:17:29.48 --> 00:17:35.56
of a cardio I would say then then a strength thing when you get to a higher level because you're

189
00:17:35.56 --> 00:17:39.56
you're just movement it's movement that's happening you know when to you know when someone's

190
00:17:39.56 --> 00:17:44.04
gonna accomplish something and if you're gonna fight it with muscle you're gonna you're gonna

191
00:17:44.04 --> 00:17:49.32
end up losing yeah and it goes back to the time thing where how does that seem to be

192
00:17:49.32 --> 00:17:54.36
is it more time and the answer is yeah it's more time because like you you learn that and again like

193
00:17:54.36 --> 00:17:59.40
where knowing where to be and where not to be where you're safe and where you're not safe

194
00:17:59.40 --> 00:18:04.04
or in your jutsu is a big deal so you know how like okay let's say and I know this with you because

195
00:18:04.04 --> 00:18:09.56
let's say if I pass your guard sorry you let me pass your guard I don't know you don't

196
00:18:09.56 --> 00:18:14.04
spaz and like you know like an tournament where the guys like really trying hard not to let you

197
00:18:14.04 --> 00:18:19.64
settle in guard and so that's a different scenario of course but you never do that you it's like

198
00:18:19.64 --> 00:18:23.24
you get to a point pass your guard once you kind of get there you just you settle and you're

199
00:18:23.24 --> 00:18:30.20
kind of relaxing because you it seems like anyway that you know you're not in danger for a submission

200
00:18:30.20 --> 00:18:34.92
so that's kind of really where the focus is it's it's not the fact that ooh he passed my guard

201
00:18:34.92 --> 00:18:40.04
oh no that's terrible it's not that it's okay now what technique do you need to implement to keep

202
00:18:40.04 --> 00:18:44.44
myself safe and the more you know about the jutsu the more you realize it doesn't take a huge amount

203
00:18:44.44 --> 00:18:49.40
of energy to to implement that technique it's usually just like an arm position make sure his

204
00:18:49.40 --> 00:18:53.40
hip is like over there and not over here and that's kind of that's it that's pretty much it

205
00:18:53.40 --> 00:18:57.88
but if you don't know that you're like oh man you're using your whole body to get out of there

206
00:18:57.88 --> 00:19:03.08
kind of thing and that's that's where you're leaving no reserves in a military perspective

207
00:19:03.08 --> 00:19:06.84
in a military you're always supposed to keep your reserves as long as you can oh yeah you're just

208
00:19:06.84 --> 00:19:11.48
you then all reserves trying to spaz out and get out of a dominant position you're also attacking

209
00:19:11.48 --> 00:19:16.76
a dominant position when you're spazzing to try and get out you're you're just going crazy trying

210
00:19:16.76 --> 00:19:21.000
to get out of this confirmed position I mean across the side or the mount those are positions that are

211
00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:26.12
really sure there's a transitional time when you should definitely spaz to try and get out once that's

212
00:19:26.12 --> 00:19:32.52
surpassed well now you're just you're just expanding energy yeah so defense learning check your diet

213
00:19:32.52 --> 00:19:36.36
too if you're like really sore and everything make sure you're getting enough protein make sure

214
00:19:36.36 --> 00:19:40.76
you're getting enough fat make sure you're getting maybe get some uh get some superkrill or some

215
00:19:40.76 --> 00:19:48.44
or some joint warfare or both because you your body needs it so just other things to try and

216
00:19:48.44 --> 00:19:55.88
put off that soreness in the pain yeah all right yeah well that twisting yeah there's definitely

217
00:19:55.88 --> 00:20:01.08
you know well yeah it's hard under joints yeah yeah hard yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

218
00:20:01.08 --> 00:20:05.40
yeah they get a workout you know they get a workout that you won't be getting doing other stuff

219
00:20:05.40 --> 00:20:08.92
unless yeah you know construction or something you know something like that same thing you're

220
00:20:08.92 --> 00:20:15.16
gonna get joint stuff that's how but yeah keep it supposed to be fun the death matches though

221
00:20:15.16 --> 00:20:23.56
death matches yeah white belt death matches yeah probably um i would estimate 40% of all

222
00:20:23.56 --> 00:20:27.72
injuries in Gjitsu come from white belt death matches is that you think that's a good number

223
00:20:27.72 --> 00:20:33.000
yeah if not higher yeah full on yeah yeah yeah yeah

224
00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:41.40
check okay next question you talk about you talk about empathy and perspective

225
00:20:41.40 --> 00:20:46.36
and building relationships as a leader but i look at leader a leader like Steve Jobs

226
00:20:46.36 --> 00:20:51.80
who's known for his hostile attitude toward people isn't that being de-falte aggressive like you

227
00:20:51.80 --> 00:20:57.80
talk about if i'm more naturally that type of leader should i go with it if it worked for Steve

228
00:20:57.80 --> 00:21:06.76
Jobs shouldn't it work for me so that's a good question and i haven't actually read the book

229
00:21:06.76 --> 00:21:10.44
about Steve Jobs and i think there's probably more than one but there's one that's real popular

230
00:21:10.44 --> 00:21:14.20
real thick and someone gave it to me and i have it and i will someday but i haven't read it yet

231
00:21:14.20 --> 00:21:20.92
and i've heard it's really good and all that and i that being said i've i've heard the same

232
00:21:20.92 --> 00:21:26.84
things about you know Steve Jobs at leadership style he was real tyrannical and i pulled a

233
00:21:26.84 --> 00:21:34.68
couple things here just from well here we go in his book about jobs time at next and returned

234
00:21:34.68 --> 00:21:42.52
apple the second coming of Steve Jobs Allen dogeman described jobs rough treatment of his

235
00:21:42.52 --> 00:21:48.52
underlings he would praise is the quote he would praise and inspire them often in very creative ways

236
00:21:48.52 --> 00:21:57.40
but he would also resort to intimidating goding berating belittle belittling and even accumulating them so

237
00:21:57.40 --> 00:22:05.88
and there's another article by Ronald regio who's a PhD in psychology and the article came from

238
00:22:05.88 --> 00:22:13.48
psychology today and it says he was obsessively controlling and given to fits of rage throwing

239
00:22:13.48 --> 00:22:18.76
tantrums and yelling at employees and board members he could tear down someone's ideas or the

240
00:22:18.76 --> 00:22:26.44
person himself in a public display some of said he took credit for others ideas and his confidence

241
00:22:26.44 --> 00:22:36.12
led to a sort of over the top arrogance so the guys kind of tyrannical one time when they were

242
00:22:36.12 --> 00:22:41.48
putting together the mobile me application and it wasn't working well and jobs told the team that

243
00:22:41.48 --> 00:22:46.68
was putting it together you when it wasn't working you've tarnished apples reputation you should

244
00:22:46.68 --> 00:22:55.40
hate each other for having let each other down so okay so first of all let's look at the fact

245
00:22:55.40 --> 00:22:59.64
and you've heard me say this before that people's strengths are their weaknesses and their

246
00:22:59.64 --> 00:23:06.52
weaknesses can be their strengths so in Steve Jobs case obviously some of this stuff some of his

247
00:23:06.52 --> 00:23:10.28
weaknesses that we're talking about here were also strengths because he was totally beyond driven

248
00:23:10.28 --> 00:23:17.80
right he was completely obsessed with doing good and all that and and he pressed toward his vision

249
00:23:17.80 --> 00:23:23.72
extremely hard he was relentless in trying to make things happen and again those are very positive

250
00:23:23.72 --> 00:23:27.16
characteristics if you got someone that's really driven and they're driven to the point of almost

251
00:23:27.16 --> 00:23:33.48
being obsessed and you you take that and those are kind of good characteristics but when they go to

252
00:23:33.48 --> 00:23:38.60
far this is why it's dichotomous the balance of leadership right when when you go to far you become a

253
00:23:38.60 --> 00:23:43.56
tyrannical leader which is not good it's not good for a team and it's and it's an a team that is

254
00:23:43.56 --> 00:23:51.64
subjected to that kind of attitude will not perform as well as a unified team period period

255
00:23:53.24 --> 00:24:02.12
so the guy was clearly hostile and at the same time clearly he was one of the most successful

256
00:24:02.12 --> 00:24:08.84
business leaders in history right so would you look at him and say okay well maybe I should be that

257
00:24:08.84 --> 00:24:16.84
way maybe I should be a tyrannical leader and I would say to that no you do not get to do that and here's why

258
00:24:16.84 --> 00:24:24.60
let's look at some other characteristics that Steve Jobs had first of all he was perhaps the

259
00:24:24.60 --> 00:24:35.08
foremost technological visionary in the history of the world right I mean he had a vision of technology

260
00:24:35.08 --> 00:24:40.44
that very few people in the history in the world of had and I will go a little bit more narrow I

261
00:24:40.44 --> 00:24:46.28
think he understood things on another level when it came to technology that the part of how

262
00:24:47.16 --> 00:24:52.12
human beings would interact with technology that's the part that I think he really had

263
00:24:52.12 --> 00:24:58.04
just incredible vision for he realized like oh these people who want to compete in their house

264
00:24:58.04 --> 00:25:03.16
and they want to reflect the way they live and they're going to want music in their pocket they're

265
00:25:03.16 --> 00:25:07.000
going to want all of their music in their pocket and they're going to want a phone that can do

266
00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:12.12
you know he had this vision of how people would interact with technology that I don't think too many

267
00:25:12.12 --> 00:25:20.28
people had so so that's number one number two he had a phenomenal feel for design

268
00:25:20.28 --> 00:25:30.36
right for design and how to merge form and function together in in an aesthetically pleasing

269
00:25:30.36 --> 00:25:35.88
and and oftentimes stunning way right if you look at the design and that's on common especially

270
00:25:35.88 --> 00:25:42.28
for someone to have that feel for design and still have a massively technical background right

271
00:25:42.84 --> 00:25:48.92
so so that again we're we're we're making a person that's like 1% of 1% of 1% already

272
00:25:48.92 --> 00:25:55.80
on top of that he got into business his business at the right time in the right place he had the right

273
00:25:55.80 --> 00:26:04.52
background on top of that the guy could speak well the guy was very articulate right he was very

274
00:26:04.52 --> 00:26:09.48
articulate with his vision if you if you watch his keynote speeches that he would give at the

275
00:26:10.04 --> 00:26:14.84
whatever it is when they have the Apple convention what's that thing called the Apple Command

276
00:26:14.84 --> 00:26:19.24
they have that thing we get up on stage and he talk about stuff and he would articulate that

277
00:26:20.12 --> 00:26:25.72
and he would do it with real clarity and he was very convincing and he was very captivating

278
00:26:25.72 --> 00:26:31.24
and people were you know they'd say Apple's a cult they'd follow that guy so he had

279
00:26:32.36 --> 00:26:37.72
all those skills those world class skills and I'm not using that term lately I'm talking

280
00:26:37.72 --> 00:26:44.12
world class skills and then they're all those world class skills are combined together into

281
00:26:44.12 --> 00:26:50.28
one package one human being and there you got you got Steve Jobs so he's got all those advantages

282
00:26:50.28 --> 00:26:55.96
and then on top of that he's had some luck along the way right yet some luck in his timing

283
00:26:55.96 --> 00:27:02.60
and just upbringing and and the exposures that he got and being exposed to computer programming

284
00:27:02.60 --> 00:27:09.16
and those things back in the day was rare and he got lucky and having that unfold from so he had

285
00:27:09.16 --> 00:27:18.44
all these things going for him that helped propel him and his company to the top so now if you're

286
00:27:18.44 --> 00:27:25.000
thinking maybe you should use his leadership style the the the questions that you should ask yourself

287
00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:31.000
is are you all one in a billion technological visionary or visionary of any kind

288
00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:38.68
the answer that is likely no and if you think it's yes maybe you should check your ego a little bit

289
00:27:39.72 --> 00:27:46.44
then you have to ask yourself do you have an eye for design on artistic eye for design like

290
00:27:46.44 --> 00:27:53.56
like divinci or Michelangelo if you have that you you you probably don't if you think you have

291
00:27:53.56 --> 00:28:00.52
that maybe you should check his ego again are you a gifted speaker and storyteller and can you convey

292
00:28:00.52 --> 00:28:09.24
your vision with total clarity to big giant groups broad groups of people and if you think you can

293
00:28:09.24 --> 00:28:16.52
do that again you should check your ego can you count on luck or do you want to count on luck

294
00:28:17.48 --> 00:28:23.88
to to close the gaps in some of those other areas so if you could do all those things if you

295
00:28:23.88 --> 00:28:31.000
answered yes 100% to all those questions and okay maybe you can get away with being a kind of

296
00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:38.20
leader that Steve Jobs was but if you're a normal person if you're a normal human being then

297
00:28:38.20 --> 00:28:43.80
maybe you should try and be a good leader and maybe you should be a leader that build relationships

298
00:28:43.80 --> 00:28:49.64
and forms cohesive teams and coalitions that help you drive your mission forward despite the

299
00:28:49.64 --> 00:29:00.76
ups and downs of whatever business you're in so that's it Steve Jobs had a lot of other things

300
00:29:00.76 --> 00:29:07.72
that made him successful and leadership and and he I'm going to eventually read the book but

301
00:29:08.52 --> 00:29:17.56
he clearly had some people around him that that utilized that skill the skills that he did

302
00:29:17.56 --> 00:29:24.20
had and have and move help moving forward right other people at the company other people early in Apple

303
00:29:24.20 --> 00:29:27.72
saw that hey you know what this guy he might be a little bit hard to deal with but he's got some

304
00:29:27.72 --> 00:29:31.56
things that we won't find anywhere else so let's prop them up and let's move forward

305
00:29:32.44 --> 00:29:38.44
and that's that's the way it works yeah I think they call that survivor ship bias where you're like

306
00:29:39.40 --> 00:29:44.44
you see oh you see a successful guy you know yeah yeah he did it that way so let's do it that way

307
00:29:44.44 --> 00:29:50.04
but yeah you kind of don't see all the other factors or whatever almost like you if you really

308
00:29:50.04 --> 00:29:54.84
think about it if Steve Jobs were to be like in these tyrannical ways or whatever if you were to be

309
00:29:54.84 --> 00:29:58.84
less like that maybe there would be more because they were more similar but he was so strong in

310
00:29:58.84 --> 00:30:03.88
these other areas that it kind of like mitigated the effects you know there's there's businesses

311
00:30:03.88 --> 00:30:08.60
that are successful because there are successful business model and they have really bad leadership

312
00:30:08.60 --> 00:30:11.88
yeah and even that kind of mess there's still kind of thing that yeah even the bad leadership

313
00:30:11.88 --> 00:30:17.56
doesn't if it's the the model is so good yeah which is a little bit contrary because you know

314
00:30:17.56 --> 00:30:21.000
I always say leadership's the most important thing on the battlefield but in the business world if you

315
00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:27.72
have a phenomenal idea then you can you can be successful on that idea alone now that is that is

316
00:30:27.72 --> 00:30:31.96
a unicorn that is one of those rare things where you have something that's that incredibly

317
00:30:32.60 --> 00:30:38.36
different and stands out from the crowd so much that it's going to be successful no matter what

318
00:30:38.36 --> 00:30:45.80
you know when the when the early gyms MMA type gyms if you had one you were successful

319
00:30:45.80 --> 00:30:50.84
didn't matter what kind of leader you were because you had you had it and now there's competition

320
00:30:50.84 --> 00:30:54.04
if you're not if you're not good leadership and you're not putting forth a good product amongst

321
00:30:54.04 --> 00:30:57.88
all the competitors you're going to have problems yeah you're going to have problems with it yeah

322
00:30:57.88 --> 00:31:04.44
and the more I kind of listen to you in life the more I realize that even then the like

323
00:31:04.44 --> 00:31:09.96
it's almost like you have to have a minimum level of leadership like you don't be

324
00:31:09.96 --> 00:31:13.32
have to be perfect if you have one of these situations where the product of the business

325
00:31:13.32 --> 00:31:18.52
is so good but still even your leadership can mess that oh yeah you can absolutely because

326
00:31:18.52 --> 00:31:22.60
you shouldn't yeah like here in a situation where like no no no one wants to work for you now

327
00:31:22.60 --> 00:31:27.40
what oh yeah good nice MMA gym you don't have any you got to work there yeah you know the whole

328
00:31:27.40 --> 00:31:31.48
time and you can't you know so it's going to kind of fall apart after a while so maybe like

329
00:31:31.48 --> 00:31:36.20
in the beginning it would be good but it'll fall apart because of your last year for sure and you

330
00:31:36.20 --> 00:31:42.20
can see that I mean who's the guy that just got removed from Uber I'd have to go into the

331
00:31:42.20 --> 00:31:50.44
I'd have to really drill down on it but the CEO of Uber got removed and you know the business

332
00:31:50.44 --> 00:31:57.64
models awesome yeah and they still remove the CEO why because there's there's issues there

333
00:31:57.64 --> 00:32:03.72
yeah and so well it's a great business model but we still need good leadership yeah so yeah

334
00:32:03.72 --> 00:32:08.60
like you like I'm basically confirming what you just said the good business model will get you

335
00:32:08.92 --> 00:32:13.24
to a certain level but then to get to the next level you're gonna need leadership and that's why

336
00:32:13.24 --> 00:32:21.24
leadership's the most important thing on the battlefield mm-hmm so what the moral don't necessarily

337
00:32:21.24 --> 00:32:28.84
be tyrannical little in fact don't be straight up tyrannical don't be and I'm not saying that

338
00:32:28.84 --> 00:32:33.80
there's not times where you have to have a little tyrannical flare because they're there maybe

339
00:32:33.80 --> 00:32:38.68
times where you need to where you need to flare up a little bit yeah but it should be rare

340
00:32:39.40 --> 00:32:42.76
yeah it should be rare the problem is it becomes a crutch for people and then they just continue

341
00:32:42.76 --> 00:32:48.04
to do it more and more and more and then it doesn't work it's like it's kind of like drugs to

342
00:32:48.04 --> 00:32:53.48
regret the like when you like when you flare up on someone and and you win or whatever you know

343
00:32:53.48 --> 00:32:57.24
you kind of like it worked yeah I worked and you kind of like it feels good feels powerful

344
00:32:58.68 --> 00:33:03.72
so I think some people that's how you know so they'll do it in an a work and they'll be like yeah

345
00:33:03.72 --> 00:33:08.28
I will need that little yeah and what's even worse is like when you when that's where you you learn

346
00:33:08.28 --> 00:33:13.32
from someone that's what you saw and then you do it and you go out work for me too and all you have to

347
00:33:13.32 --> 00:33:19.48
be is treat people bad and be a jerk and yell and my subordinates will do what I tell them to do

348
00:33:19.48 --> 00:33:24.52
and they will right a subordinate will if you bark at them and scream at them they're going to

349
00:33:24.52 --> 00:33:29.24
do what you say at the moment the problem is what kind of team of you built that's the problem

350
00:33:29.88 --> 00:33:33.40
what is that subordinate going to do when you're not there they're going to do everything they can

351
00:33:33.40 --> 00:33:37.48
to cut corners and and really they don't care about they don't care about you they don't want to

352
00:33:37.48 --> 00:33:41.48
do good job for you yeah so when you're not there they're not going to do a good job for you yeah

353
00:33:41.48 --> 00:33:47.16
so you get addicted to yelling and screaming but it doesn't work in the broad sense of what you're

354
00:33:47.16 --> 00:33:54.68
trying to make happen yeah slowly pulling apart that's a question i'm 26 years old i'm currently

355
00:33:54.68 --> 00:34:01.32
an undercover detective i've recently been told that i'm being promoted to sergeant over department's

356
00:34:01.32 --> 00:34:06.84
investigations division i've been the youngest person to hold that position in our department's history

357
00:34:06.84 --> 00:34:13.80
all the guys i'll be in charge of our much older some in their late 40s how do i as a younger

358
00:34:13.80 --> 00:34:20.44
leader lead them how do you demand an earn respect from an older group i'm ready for the job and

359
00:34:20.44 --> 00:34:27.24
know what the job entails but i'm nervous to lead a group of nine people that are all older than me so

360
00:34:27.24 --> 00:34:32.84
i'm i've answered this question over and over again and i'm going to do a quick job over here just

361
00:34:32.84 --> 00:34:39.000
because people may not they have gone back and listen to all all the other podcasts but you

362
00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:43.96
have listened the answers always the same and it's always the same whether you're a young person

363
00:34:43.96 --> 00:34:48.36
leading old person whether you're an old person leading young for people whether you're a woman

364
00:34:48.36 --> 00:34:53.80
leading man a man leading man leading women whether you're coming in from a different department

365
00:34:53.80 --> 00:34:56.92
into a new department that you don't know anybody whether you're going into a thing that you

366
00:34:56.92 --> 00:35:01.000
don't have the experience it's like all of the same basically what it is you're going into a

367
00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:07.000
leadership position yeah that's what it is be humble listen take advice build relationships keep your

368
00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:12.76
ego in check also that one of the reasons i pulled the dead pull this question i was like how do

369
00:35:12.76 --> 00:35:19.08
you demand respect will be answers you don't demand respect and if you don't if you do demand

370
00:35:19.08 --> 00:35:26.36
respect you'll get anything but respect from people so so get that out of your head you earn respect

371
00:35:26.36 --> 00:35:31.96
and how do you earn respect you respect them in this case you respect their experience you

372
00:35:31.96 --> 00:35:37.72
respect their knowledge you respect it they've been doing it for a long time you have respect for it

373
00:35:37.72 --> 00:35:44.36
and when you show respect for them they're going to respect you back now none of this means be passive

374
00:35:45.80 --> 00:35:52.20
right this doesn't mean coward down no you you still have to lead you still have to step up

375
00:35:52.20 --> 00:35:58.36
but it does mean be humble be open minded be proactive listen ask questions ask for opinions

376
00:35:59.48 --> 00:36:05.48
decentralized all aspects of operations including the planning which we already talked about

377
00:36:07.24 --> 00:36:14.28
and then with all those things set a high standard and then the final and most important well

378
00:36:14.28 --> 00:36:22.12
I don't know it's equally important I'd say work harder than everyone else and expect nothing in return

379
00:36:23.88 --> 00:36:30.44
that's it that's it you're the boss you better be it you better be at work before everyone and you better be

380
00:36:31.48 --> 00:36:37.32
leaving work after everyone and that's how you develop a reputation of being a hard worker and being a

381
00:36:37.32 --> 00:36:44.92
hard worker and it's own right garners respect from most people there's there's a fraction of losers

382
00:36:44.92 --> 00:36:50.68
that are like oh echo he works so much it's it's so lame like no like as I'm making him look

383
00:36:50.68 --> 00:36:53.96
bad or something like yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

384
00:36:53.96 --> 00:36:59.48
like there's a small fraction of people that that might think that way but but no you work harder

385
00:37:00.36 --> 00:37:04.84
you you put in the time you put in the effort you study you read which you're supposed to read

386
00:37:04.84 --> 00:37:09.48
you get the professional knowledge that you're supposed to get you don't impose that on people

387
00:37:09.48 --> 00:37:12.76
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah because you're your book knowledge when you start

388
00:37:12.76 --> 00:37:17.08
off in this situation your book knowledge isn't as strong as the experience guys in in this case

389
00:37:17.08 --> 00:37:21.72
you know in the in the law enforcement the guys that have been in the streets they know stuff that

390
00:37:21.72 --> 00:37:27.72
you don't know yeah so you study what you can but you keep an open mind so you can listen to

391
00:37:27.72 --> 00:37:36.04
what their experience says yeah okay don't impose on them wait when you say don't impose it

392
00:37:36.04 --> 00:37:42.28
on them does that mean don't impose them like make them it's like them echo section four two

393
00:37:42.28 --> 00:37:47.08
alpha of the document says that we're supposed to use this methodology when we do this

394
00:37:47.88 --> 00:37:52.12
you should know that methodology you should understand why that methodology is important but

395
00:37:52.12 --> 00:37:55.96
if you say hey juggle we don't do that way and here's why I shouldn't be like oh I'm telling you

396
00:37:55.96 --> 00:38:00.20
that's by the book yeah it's by the book now if it's by the book because it's there's an

397
00:38:00.20 --> 00:38:06.04
ethical reason okay well that makes sense but if it's by the book because that's what the book says

398
00:38:06.04 --> 00:38:11.96
but by the book yeah yeah or you know the guy who's like who works extra hard but he kind of

399
00:38:11.96 --> 00:38:15.48
in a way throws it in everyone's face how hard he works you know don't do that guy that's

400
00:38:15.48 --> 00:38:19.08
that's an important thing it's a very important piece don't you don't step on people's toes with

401
00:38:19.08 --> 00:38:27.000
this stuff yeah that's wrong don't do that yeah let's check check

402
00:38:27.96 --> 00:38:34.12
X-Wish juggle I'm extremely extremely driven and have high expectations for myself

403
00:38:34.12 --> 00:38:41.24
and my team it appears that now I may have pushed them too hard and their developing negative

404
00:38:41.24 --> 00:38:47.24
attitudes I feel like you're going to say play the game and develop relationships with them

405
00:38:47.24 --> 00:38:55.48
which are really just ignore who I am should I try to be someone different than myself

406
00:38:57.96 --> 00:39:05.08
yeah well you called it question person whoever has this question you called I it's exactly what

407
00:39:05.08 --> 00:39:09.40
I'm gonna say I'm gonna say you need to play the game look at what your current path has done

408
00:39:10.84 --> 00:39:16.44
look at what you the real you look what it's done the real you has created a negative attitude

409
00:39:16.44 --> 00:39:22.44
with all your team that's the real you so is that what you want to perpetuate

410
00:39:23.24 --> 00:39:27.16
creating negative attitudes against your with your team and by the way they're just getting started

411
00:39:27.16 --> 00:39:30.36
and if you think negative if you think you're going to keep acting the same way and the negative

412
00:39:30.36 --> 00:39:34.20
attitude they're going to somehow miraculously turn positive that's not happening they're going to

413
00:39:34.20 --> 00:39:41.80
get more negative yeah so when people have negative attitudes I saw somebody quoted this

414
00:39:41.80 --> 00:39:49.72
the other day on social media somewhere you know the quote was like no no no it's not my fault

415
00:39:49.72 --> 00:39:55.64
when I my subordinates have a bad attitude or something like that and about a bunch of people responded

416
00:39:55.64 --> 00:40:00.68
you should read the book extreme ownership because it absolutely is your fault it is your fault

417
00:40:00.68 --> 00:40:05.80
if your team has a bad attitude it's your fault you're the leader you only attitude if they're

418
00:40:05.80 --> 00:40:09.96
attitude is bad then it's then it's actually your fault now this is not to say that you can't

419
00:40:09.96 --> 00:40:14.20
have a bad apple on the team that's completely possible and who's responsible for getting rid of

420
00:40:14.20 --> 00:40:19.16
the bad apples you are you're the boss because the fact of the matter is you might have a

421
00:40:19.16 --> 00:40:23.88
uh bad apple on your team you might even have two bad apples on your team you don't have

422
00:40:23.88 --> 00:40:29.08
14 bad apples on the team when you have 14 battles the apples on the team guess who the problem is

423
00:40:29.08 --> 00:40:38.60
it's you so here's what you do little little tactical advice trying get some perspective

424
00:40:38.60 --> 00:40:44.68
from them trying to understand where they're coming from what challenges they face what's pulling them off

425
00:40:44.68 --> 00:40:51.56
track and when you do this you kind of take ownership of it in your approach so you say hey guys

426
00:40:51.56 --> 00:40:57.48
I realize I don't think I'm really seeing things from your point of view and I need to because I'm

427
00:40:57.48 --> 00:41:04.52
here to support you and without you performing well then we fail so I think I need to do a better

428
00:41:04.52 --> 00:41:09.000
job supporting you and I can only do that if I know what your issues are so I can do my best to

429
00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:14.44
get them fixed so what can I do better to help you right so now they're going to start telling you

430
00:41:14.44 --> 00:41:19.16
all here's what here's that's problem there's that problem and then what you do is you listen to

431
00:41:19.16 --> 00:41:23.88
their problems you actually listen to their problems you don't say hey you're complaining

432
00:41:25.08 --> 00:41:30.36
no you actually listen to their problems and then you actually see what you can do to mitigate

433
00:41:30.36 --> 00:41:38.12
their issues and as you do that guess what's happening you're actually forming a bond you're actually

434
00:41:38.12 --> 00:41:46.92
forming into a team because you're working together to solve issues again I it sounds really simple

435
00:41:46.92 --> 00:41:52.76
right but clearly here's someone asking this question now again like if you have some members of the

436
00:41:52.76 --> 00:42:00.12
team that are that are actual negative complaining winers then you might have to get rid of them

437
00:42:01.72 --> 00:42:05.56
and that's part of being a leader is knowing when you have to get rid of someone

438
00:42:08.36 --> 00:42:14.44
you know I sometimes people they they take the extreme ownership attitude and they say you know what

439
00:42:15.80 --> 00:42:21.32
I'm the leader I own everything I'm extreme ownership and if someone's not performing well

440
00:42:21.32 --> 00:42:26.36
then that's my fault yeah that's my fault I need to coach more I need to I need to do it's my fault

441
00:42:26.36 --> 00:42:31.48
that my team member is not doing well and that's correct it is your fault it's your responsibility

442
00:42:31.48 --> 00:42:35.88
to train them coach them mentor and do whatever else you can do to fix them but at the end of the

443
00:42:35.88 --> 00:42:42.76
day if they still are not competent at their task and you've done everything you can it's

444
00:42:42.76 --> 00:42:49.08
your responsible to get rid of them that is also a part of ownership so

445
00:42:49.08 --> 00:42:54.84
yeah like I'll have someone complaining that they've got oh this you know one of my team leaders

446
00:42:54.84 --> 00:42:58.52
like they're talking about their subordinate team leaders no no one might this this guy is

447
00:42:58.52 --> 00:43:04.60
you just a bad leader why is he still here oh your team that team isn't doing well because

448
00:43:04.60 --> 00:43:08.12
they have a bad leader who's fault is that well the leaders fault no it's your fault you're

449
00:43:08.12 --> 00:43:15.08
in charge of the leader yeah is ridiculous so back to the original question

450
00:43:15.08 --> 00:43:23.40
you're whatever you call that you're who you actually are is not working well he probably is

451
00:43:23.40 --> 00:43:27.88
thinking he's a Steve Jobs type I have you know what you call we gotta do this but it's not working

452
00:43:29.08 --> 00:43:34.60
and he's not in a unicorn business model that's still making a ton of money regardless so

453
00:43:34.60 --> 00:43:42.60
what does he have to do play the game build relationships see the perspective of your team so that

454
00:43:42.60 --> 00:43:51.96
you can actually form a team be a better leader that's basically what I'm saying yeah so they

455
00:43:51.96 --> 00:43:58.44
and it's interesting the you know what they call framing you know you frame something

456
00:43:58.44 --> 00:44:03.08
in a certain way to make it kind of sound a certain way whatever so he's an extremely driven

457
00:44:03.08 --> 00:44:09.48
and have high expectations for myself and my team it appears that now I may have pushed them too

458
00:44:09.48 --> 00:44:15.32
hard and they're developing negative attitude so having extremely being extremely driven and having

459
00:44:15.32 --> 00:44:21.72
high expectations doesn't equal driving them too hard so they develop negative attitude those are

460
00:44:21.72 --> 00:44:30.60
two different things you know you can still be extremely high expectations you can be driving

461
00:44:30.60 --> 00:44:36.28
extremely hard and you can still have a incredibly positive attitude with your team yeah no doubt

462
00:44:36.28 --> 00:44:43.96
yeah good point so and then it gets equated into that's just who I am so he just kind of put

463
00:44:43.96 --> 00:44:49.24
it all into one ball and without one there's no other kind of situation it's just not how it is

464
00:44:49.24 --> 00:44:55.88
so apparently you might be committed he might be committed to being all of these things and that's

465
00:44:55.88 --> 00:45:00.52
who I am and that's kind of it you know kind of thing and I think that's like the mistake

466
00:45:00.52 --> 00:45:04.12
planning people make we say this a lot where people will be like hey I'm just straightforward you know

467
00:45:04.12 --> 00:45:08.52
take me take it or leave it kind of thing and be like okay but you're gonna in your case lose you

468
00:45:08.52 --> 00:45:15.64
know in your in your situation that's the big piece is that in their case they're gonna lose yeah

469
00:45:15.64 --> 00:45:23.48
so let me ask you this question if you're so driven and you have such high expectations that you

470
00:45:23.48 --> 00:45:29.64
want to win so bad but the way you're performing as a human being and as a leader is going to

471
00:45:29.64 --> 00:45:35.48
make you lose then what are you supposed to do if you change the way you behave you will come

472
00:45:35.48 --> 00:45:44.52
a better leader yeah that's what you do yes sir so you take and this is total speculation on my

473
00:45:44.52 --> 00:45:51.56
part but you keep so this equation that we're presented with being extremely driven keep that

474
00:45:51.56 --> 00:45:56.28
high expectations keep that pushing your team hard keep that I would say too hard and that's

475
00:45:56.28 --> 00:46:01.32
gonna be a judgment call from day to day for sure but there's a parting here that's more implied

476
00:46:01.32 --> 00:46:05.08
that you're being an asshole somewhere in here you're being an asshole how about you take out that

477
00:46:05.08 --> 00:46:10.04
part take out the being the asshole part and then keep everything else see all that goes yeah

478
00:46:10.44 --> 00:46:14.68
because you kind of know when you're being a dick you don't see unless you're like not being honest

479
00:46:14.68 --> 00:46:18.44
with yourself there are some people that don't there's some people that don't get it

480
00:46:19.96 --> 00:46:23.64
there's some people that don't get it all right because it's like you know how like when you

481
00:46:23.64 --> 00:46:29.88
don't like people they just can't step outside of themselves and you said to me I wouldn't care

482
00:46:29.88 --> 00:46:35.32
kind of thing and be like bro you you know you're not me and why am I you kind of yeah you're right

483
00:46:35.32 --> 00:46:41.000
they kept attached yeah absolutely people that don't know yeah socially

484
00:46:43.16 --> 00:46:50.60
incapable of receiving you know clues social clues yeah people social cues from people yeah

485
00:46:50.60 --> 00:46:55.000
you know they don't see the look in their face when they're talking to them yeah that's true

486
00:46:55.000 --> 00:47:00.12
I mean I'm thinking of like three examples for sure there's all kinds of examples yeah also

487
00:47:00.12 --> 00:47:04.52
that then that would go back to what you're saying how you see get input from them you're just so you

488
00:47:04.52 --> 00:47:09.000
got to kind of yeah see yeah you can do it that's a solvable problem so this is a very solvable

489
00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:16.04
problem and I've seen people solve this problem I've helped people solve this exact problem

490
00:47:16.04 --> 00:47:22.76
and the weird thing is they think and it's part ego but it's also part they're just

491
00:47:22.76 --> 00:47:28.12
don't present they think they're doing a great thing like they think that they're

492
00:47:28.12 --> 00:47:33.72
driving everything that they're doing in their mind they're just awesome for being

493
00:47:33.72 --> 00:47:38.12
supproposient so hard it's just the way I am and all that stuff and they think it's awesome

494
00:47:38.68 --> 00:47:45.08
but again if you want to win so bad then you have to play the game you won't win

495
00:47:45.08 --> 00:47:52.04
by abusing people you won't win with a team anyways you won't it won't happen yeah

496
00:47:55.24 --> 00:47:58.52
it's no use being the best dancer if you're not invited on the dance floor

497
00:48:00.12 --> 00:48:03.16
I'll leave that one with you yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

498
00:48:03.16 --> 00:48:09.64
always that cool next question actually that problem is so solvable that you could this is

499
00:48:09.64 --> 00:48:16.44
possible where you could just show just that much like more I don't know caring or respect just

500
00:48:16.44 --> 00:48:21.000
that much respect and do for like two weeks yeah just the idea that just the fact that you're

501
00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:25.000
doing it now people will be like hey wait you should leave it here's the thing here's the thing

502
00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:31.000
if a person has an ego which this person could very well have a big ego because that's why

503
00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:35.24
they have these high expectations and that's why they're so driven because they just they

504
00:48:35.24 --> 00:48:40.44
if they have that kind of ego that's the person that you can't help because if they just look at

505
00:48:40.44 --> 00:48:44.68
the team and say those guys should be harder workers yeah those guys aren't working as hard as

506
00:48:44.68 --> 00:48:52.28
me they're not as focused as I am they don't care as much as I do so to everyone else on the team

507
00:48:53.08 --> 00:49:00.20
has a problem but I'm perfect and you can't you know look at how driven I am look at how focused I am

508
00:49:00.20 --> 00:49:06.20
look at how high my expectations are of myself but if you can here's another thing if your team

509
00:49:06.20 --> 00:49:11.48
cannot relate to your expectations like they don't even they don't even see him as realistic or achievable

510
00:49:11.48 --> 00:49:17.48
or anything what could have your expectations yeah what good are they they're only good okay

511
00:49:17.48 --> 00:49:19.48
they don't make any sense

512
00:49:22.36 --> 00:49:27.16
next question dear juggle I've been watching some of you YouTube links with great interest

513
00:49:27.16 --> 00:49:36.68
must be a subscriber to the YouTube channel yeah watch the videos I'm sure you're extremely busy

514
00:49:36.68 --> 00:49:41.80
but I have a question which if you have time I would greatly appreciate your reply I have taken

515
00:49:41.80 --> 00:49:50.44
the light opening very much so I'm going to incorporate that approach I've been I've taken up

516
00:49:50.44 --> 00:50:00.36
BJJ G2 recently in London in the UK so so a beginner I know you're a great advocate of the

517
00:50:00.36 --> 00:50:06.76
system but my basic question is your opinion does it truly relate to real life fight situations

518
00:50:06.76 --> 00:50:12.60
I'm a man now approaching my mid 40s in pretty good shape that I'm looking to focus on a martial art

519
00:50:12.60 --> 00:50:17.64
that would help me if I ever need to defend myself or my family I love the discipline and humility

520
00:50:17.64 --> 00:50:25.08
of BJJ and as a workout I know and I know the philosophy of BJJ is that most fights end up on the ground

521
00:50:25.08 --> 00:50:33.56
and it's here that BJJ excels but what of the other guys or what of the other guys who might be

522
00:50:33.56 --> 00:50:39.96
standing around ready to battle bottle you or kick you in the hand once you're grappling on the

523
00:50:39.96 --> 00:50:47.08
ground etc again this is a question that first of all we I mean I have to listen a lot of times

524
00:50:47.08 --> 00:50:50.68
sure but I'll answer it one more time here uh it.

525
00:50:52.28 --> 00:50:57.40
BJJ is the best place to start you should also learn boxing wrestling kick boxing this is all

526
00:50:57.40 --> 00:51:01.80
in discipline because freedom field manual so if you get that book you this will be laid out for you very

527
00:51:01.80 --> 00:51:09.80
well does so so yes that's what you should start studying with this guy mid 40s needs wants to

528
00:51:09.80 --> 00:51:17.72
learn something yes start with your jitsu does it relate to real life situations yes it does it absolutely

529
00:51:17.72 --> 00:51:25.24
does I've been in them it's extremely effective and you can see that over and over again speaking

530
00:51:25.24 --> 00:51:34.04
of YouTube you can see how effective your jitsu is in real fights now it's important to remember

531
00:51:34.04 --> 00:51:40.12
that for self defense the grappling arts in general should be used primarily to get away

532
00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:45.64
it to avoid going to the ground right like when you bring up oh well there's one of those

533
00:51:45.64 --> 00:51:51.80
other people that might be there you you should why are you on the ground jjitsu will give you the best

534
00:51:51.80 --> 00:51:57.16
opportunity to get up off the ground that's what it gives you and then you can get away from the

535
00:51:57.16 --> 00:52:01.08
people that are getting ready to stick you with a bottle smashed bottle or getting ready to kick

536
00:52:01.08 --> 00:52:04.68
you in the head if you don't know jjitsu guess what you're doing you're on the ground and you're

537
00:52:04.68 --> 00:52:08.84
getting kicked in the head and you're getting stabbed with a bottle that's why you train jjitsu

538
00:52:08.84 --> 00:52:13.64
so you can get up off the ground not so you can take someone to the ground because by the way and

539
00:52:13.64 --> 00:52:18.92
I've said this before if your goal is to punch me and you're standing at a punching distance or

540
00:52:18.92 --> 00:52:23.80
striking distance from me I can just run away that's myself defense I can get away from you

541
00:52:23.80 --> 00:52:32.84
so that's why we train jjitsu that's the primer that's why you should start with it

542
00:52:32.84 --> 00:52:37.80
because otherwise I'm just gonna get away from you if you're not grab if once you grab me though

543
00:52:37.80 --> 00:52:43.64
I can't get away from you anymore now I have to be able to do handle myself that's why

544
00:52:43.64 --> 00:52:47.40
I know jjitsu so I can handle myself once you've grabbed me if you're not grabbing me I can

545
00:52:47.40 --> 00:52:52.44
just get away from you I can just run away from you if you don't want to run away because it's

546
00:52:52.44 --> 00:52:56.52
gonna hurt your pride well then guess what that's that's why you train all the time

547
00:52:57.24 --> 00:53:01.48
I mean now we go back and forth and we can talk about all the negative things that will happen

548
00:53:01.48 --> 00:53:04.84
if you get into a street fight like the fact that you can get hurt you can get stabbed you can get shot

549
00:53:04.84 --> 00:53:09.16
you can get sued you can get arrested you can ruin your life you can do all these horrible things

550
00:53:09.16 --> 00:53:14.44
can happen if you get in a street fight so so so that's why my advice to you is to avoid street fights

551
00:53:14.44 --> 00:53:18.28
yeah that's what you do and by the way that's why you work on your awareness that's why you make

552
00:53:18.28 --> 00:53:23.96
your your your your wife and your children aware of what's going on around them to pay attention to

553
00:53:23.96 --> 00:53:27.72
what's happening in the street so one thing that was interesting when I was in Australia and I was in

554
00:53:27.72 --> 00:53:33.80
the nice part of Australia there's and I was talking to some people about it you know there's just

555
00:53:33.80 --> 00:53:41.000
a very relaxed atmosphere where I was I was standing at a very nice part of Australia there's a

556
00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:49.48
very relaxed atmosphere when you're in America there's a heightened atmosphere there's a heightened

557
00:53:49.48 --> 00:53:52.68
awareness you have to have and depending on where you are and it's the same thing I'm sure in

558
00:53:52.68 --> 00:53:57.000
Australia I'll go on the way to the nice part I'm sure you could go to some some tough areas where you

559
00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:02.20
better be more aware of what's happening but teach your kids because some kids don't know the

560
00:54:02.20 --> 00:54:07.08
difference maybe you don't even know the difference of what to look out for what kind of people you

561
00:54:07.08 --> 00:54:15.96
need to watch out for in the street so work on that and then yes train and up here in U.K. and

562
00:54:15.96 --> 00:54:21.64
of course I've said this before if you're truly in a situation where you feel threatened on

563
00:54:21.64 --> 00:54:28.44
the regular basis well then what you need is a firearm because if someone's going to attack you

564
00:54:28.92 --> 00:54:33.24
with a knife or with a bottle or with themselves having a gun the only you did to it's going to help you

565
00:54:33.24 --> 00:54:41.56
boxing is going to help you as scream is not going to help you someone has a gun so yeah and

566
00:54:41.56 --> 00:54:45.64
by the way oh yeah if you're in a knife fight and you know some a scream of that will help you

567
00:54:46.20 --> 00:54:52.12
but what if the other guys better than you what what if there's two of them the minute you put

568
00:54:52.12 --> 00:55:00.04
two people against one the odds of winning are it just extremely low extremely low does it happen

569
00:55:00.04 --> 00:55:05.72
yes it happens can you knock someone out yes you can that's why you train boxing yeah so

570
00:55:07.48 --> 00:55:14.04
yes again train some jiu jitsu start there and go and keep going and don't stop yeah yeah

571
00:55:14.04 --> 00:55:18.12
it seems like this question always comes from a place where they just assume all these things and those

572
00:55:18.12 --> 00:55:23.80
things are I'm going to choose to get in a fight with someone bring it to the ground in the middle of

573
00:55:23.80 --> 00:55:28.68
the street or in the club I don't know wherever wherever there's potential other attackers with bottles

574
00:55:28.68 --> 00:55:33.64
man kicks to the head and so all these things are just assumed kind of like yeah you take

575
00:55:33.64 --> 00:55:37.80
jitsu now you can go to the club and get in fights and win all the time it's kind of like that's

576
00:55:37.80 --> 00:55:43.000
kind of where the questions coming from where how you said yeah it allows you to get up and so

577
00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:50.28
basically it allows you to control your situation your fight scenario yeah more yes and I would even say

578
00:55:50.28 --> 00:55:56.76
it allows you a lot more to control it because even if even if you do take it let's say you take it

579
00:55:56.76 --> 00:56:02.60
to the ground I met more by a little bit more than nothing yeah no yeah I'm saying a lot more

580
00:56:02.60 --> 00:56:09.48
because really when you think of it and I try to granted them yeah even like at a beginner level so

581
00:56:09.48 --> 00:56:17.80
let's say okay if you choose to engage with someone and some kind of fight right it's up to you how

582
00:56:18.60 --> 00:56:22.68
heavy you want to take that fight you you want to go to 10 you go to 10 you want to go to just one

583
00:56:22.68 --> 00:56:27.40
you can go to one so if you wind up on the ground which is the worst place to be if you don't know

584
00:56:27.40 --> 00:56:31.72
anything on the ground yeah and that's a side from how you said if the guy's a gun in shoot you

585
00:56:31.72 --> 00:56:34.92
that's a dare you're talking about that's not even a fight scenario that's you know

586
00:56:35.88 --> 00:56:45.88
so you wind up on the ground it's a gunfight yeah if you know boxing you're gonna have

587
00:56:45.88 --> 00:56:49.88
almost no control over that scenario we're in the comments on the ground top yeah yeah

588
00:56:49.88 --> 00:56:55.80
your boxing is your boxing is not worthless you know marginalized we'll say but it's

589
00:56:55.80 --> 00:57:01.96
heavily marginalized yeah heavily marginalized yeah same thing with you know kickboxing and whatever

590
00:57:01.96 --> 00:57:07.96
so there's that if you know Jesus you're just a little bit of Jesus too if you're on the ground

591
00:57:07.96 --> 00:57:13.88
you have control over the fight more depending on your level whatever so if you if you're at that

592
00:57:13.88 --> 00:57:17.96
point still facing a threat of someone with a bottle or kicks to the head or whatever while you're

593
00:57:17.96 --> 00:57:24.44
on the ground compare if you know Jesus you're still saving way more control way more so

594
00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:30.28
meanwhile like the box situation or karate situation whenever it's gonna be less effective in

595
00:57:30.28 --> 00:57:37.24
controlling your situation no if you don't look at it like that like if you look at it like okay

596
00:57:37.24 --> 00:57:43.64
this guy's squaring up to me now I want to mess it up as quickly as I can then okay you know like

597
00:57:43.64 --> 00:57:48.20
you can do boxing and just take it to ten but you don't have the option of taking it from one

598
00:57:48.20 --> 00:57:54.52
two through nothing like yeah but the other thing is like it's hard to knock someone out

599
00:57:55.72 --> 00:58:01.56
that's the thing it's hard to knock someone out does it happen yeah it does happen and it can

600
00:58:01.56 --> 00:58:08.60
happen you do it can happen you do it's but it's hard to knock someone out and it's it's risky as

601
00:58:08.60 --> 00:58:13.96
soon as you start saying okay you and I are gonna just trade punches there's a risk for both of us

602
00:58:13.96 --> 00:58:20.68
there's a risk for me the assurance of me being able to handle the situation the way I want it to go

603
00:58:20.68 --> 00:58:26.04
by closing the distance with you getting control getting a hold of you if I'm trained and you're not

604
00:58:26.76 --> 00:58:32.60
you're you're you're you're you're done you're done right that's the way it works yeah and then

605
00:58:32.60 --> 00:58:37.48
even then that's like if you choose for this guy to be done so if you're if your sole purpose is to

606
00:58:37.48 --> 00:58:41.32
keep yourself safe yeah you could just put the guy to sleep and walk away yeah or gently

607
00:58:41.32 --> 00:58:45.32
lame down like I'm not even heard I'm not gonna put him to sleep nothing mount you see a guy

608
00:58:45.32 --> 00:58:51.000
you can see the guy coming with a bottle or whatever anymore if you know you get to so yeah well there's

609
00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:58.12
the whole thing of when you're just used to the physical contact the the the body's

610
00:58:58.12 --> 00:59:07.88
clashing and you know grappling let's shock yeah so yeah trained to get to train boxing wrestling

611
00:59:07.88 --> 00:59:11.72
kick boxing and then of course now people will be like what about judo yes trained judo

612
00:59:11.72 --> 00:59:15.64
what about sombo yes trained sombo what else what else do I need to cool what about

613
00:59:15.64 --> 00:59:21.56
crawvlogger sure train it yeah train everything yeah I'm down I think star would you do

614
00:59:21.56 --> 00:59:25.48
what you said on a real general level is the most critical things like when someone gets a

615
00:59:25.48 --> 00:59:29.56
hold of you like and you put this into perspective a while ago when you were like yeah if someone

616
00:59:29.56 --> 00:59:35.000
wants to fight you walk away for run away you can use a butt and you said all these scenarios you

617
00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:39.72
run away you go away you want to keep yourself safe you don't be there the best thing to do to avoid

618
00:59:40.28 --> 00:59:45.72
the the getting punched falling on the curb dying getting stabbed getting kicked getting stabbed

619
00:59:45.72 --> 00:59:50.20
with the bottle getting arrested getting lawsuit getting all those things happening the best thing

620
00:59:50.20 --> 00:59:56.84
to run away walk away yeah leave fully and then you said but what happens when you can't run away

621
00:59:56.84 --> 01:00:02.12
because I grab there you have it yeah so yeah so it seems like yeah I'm gonna train boxing so

622
01:00:02.12 --> 01:00:05.88
I can do self-defense oh no you want to fight somebody that's what you want to do you want to

623
01:00:05.88 --> 01:00:12.84
punch people in the face well boxing juditsu I mean yeah I mean boxing is a skill that every

624
01:00:13.80 --> 01:00:19.24
but he should have not everyone good people should have because there's two critical things on

625
01:00:19.24 --> 01:00:23.08
that that you learn from boxing is how to punch people and how to avoid getting punched yeah

626
01:00:23.08 --> 01:00:27.64
and how to keep your guard up right it was an important it was a really important skills to have

627
01:00:27.64 --> 01:00:32.44
yeah fully but what what I mean is if you're starting from nothing and you're like okay I'm

628
01:00:32.44 --> 01:00:38.52
gonna you know I'm gonna choose to address myself defense you situation you have a fantasy

629
01:00:39.16 --> 01:00:44.68
that you saw a guy on youtube that was clearly a boxer knock up knock out two people in a street

630
01:00:44.68 --> 01:00:49.000
fight and you're like that's what I'm gonna do yeah yeah and what you actually watched was a guy

631
01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:56.92
that was a golden gloves boxer yeah who is sober knock out two drunk idiots and guess what a

632
01:00:56.92 --> 01:01:01.000
golden gloves boxer will do that if you're a part of the golden gloves boxer they're freaking good

633
01:01:01.96 --> 01:01:09.08
they're freaking good they're they're they're you know like a black belt in boxing yeah

634
01:01:09.80 --> 01:01:16.36
and they will knock out two drunk guys all day long yeah yeah it's weird too because he kind of

635
01:01:16.36 --> 01:01:21.40
but if one of those if a third drunk guy or even that first drunk guy grabs a hold of the

636
01:01:21.40 --> 01:01:26.52
boxer and just and gets him to the ground the boxer's gonna be in trouble yeah that's the way it is

637
01:01:26.52 --> 01:01:32.28
we and this is like my thoughts this is fact this is like I talked about this in this

638
01:01:32.28 --> 01:01:39.40
in the field manual is like look there's no conjecture it's not like I wonder what would happen

639
01:01:39.40 --> 01:01:46.36
no we know what happens we know what happens when two people fight and and you can watch all the

640
01:01:46.36 --> 01:01:54.04
different various types of styles going at it and you can watch what happens and sure you can find

641
01:01:54.04 --> 01:02:00.12
the rare video where hey this boxer knocks out a couple drunk people or or or even hey the

642
01:02:00.12 --> 01:02:04.68
boxer knocks out the jutsu guy does that happen yes it can absolutely happen that's why you train

643
01:02:04.68 --> 01:02:12.04
boxing too yeah next question I've not been working out regularly regularly for several years now

644
01:02:12.04 --> 01:02:20.60
obviously I'm fat and lazy but I want to get after it so the question is should I go all in level nine

645
01:02:20.60 --> 01:02:29.56
destruction maximum madness or ease into it at level three cruising edition respect all right well this

646
01:02:29.56 --> 01:02:36.12
there's a couple different approaches now when I hear this first of all you you don't want to get hurt

647
01:02:36.12 --> 01:02:42.60
right and you also don't want to make yourself trying do things that are so hard and so painful that

648
01:02:43.48 --> 01:02:49.40
you can't do it repeatedly so if you just destroy yourself what do you say if you destroy yourself

649
01:02:49.40 --> 01:02:53.80
level nine destruction maximum madness but then you can't work out for two more weeks

650
01:02:53.80 --> 01:02:57.96
well guess what what you do in the mean no let's say realistically you got domes

651
01:02:57.96 --> 01:03:05.24
come sure right delayed onset muscle so let's say you did so many burpees that your legs

652
01:03:05.24 --> 01:03:12.36
you couldn't sit down without your legs being in pain so now so you take so you take three days

653
01:03:13.08 --> 01:03:18.92
four days have you ever had domes so bad that you took four days off no okay let's say you take three days

654
01:03:18.92 --> 01:03:23.80
off what did you do during those three days did you hold the line did you stay on the path

655
01:03:23.80 --> 01:03:31.16
are we you eating cheetos yeah yeah that's what you were doing so if you destroy yourself

656
01:03:31.16 --> 01:03:35.32
to where you can't stay on the path that's not good you want to stay on the path

657
01:03:37.16 --> 01:03:42.92
I think doing something that you can handle or maybe something just beyond what you can handle

658
01:03:42.92 --> 01:03:47.96
every single day is more important so going at a level not not cruising level

659
01:03:47.96 --> 01:03:53.88
not level three but let's let's find a solid level five where you can you're pushing yourself

660
01:03:53.88 --> 01:03:59.48
I read a thousand words a day when I'm writing and do the equivalent of that right

661
01:03:59.48 --> 01:04:03.24
the reason I read because if I said okay I do not just to today I just have to write

662
01:04:04.36 --> 01:04:09.56
five thousand words that's five hours yeah we do I have five hours today no I don't

663
01:04:10.12 --> 01:04:15.64
I can squeeze out 52 minutes though and get a thousand words written that I can do so that's

664
01:04:15.64 --> 01:04:21.56
that's what I think you need to do you need to get consistent if you bite off more than you chew

665
01:04:22.12 --> 01:04:26.52
then you can chew you you might very well choke on it so don't so don't do that

666
01:04:27.64 --> 01:04:33.56
so pick something realistic don't do people say that that must be the first time I heard it

667
01:04:33.56 --> 01:04:37.40
so if you bite out more than you can chew you might choke on it did you make that up or you get

668
01:04:37.40 --> 01:04:42.12
that from somewhere I think I well I just I don't know I think I made it up just good but I'm sure

669
01:04:42.12 --> 01:04:50.52
something like no this guy said it in 1978 yeah but that's the beauty of it so pick something

670
01:04:50.52 --> 01:04:55.80
realistic like for something that you can handle and then get after it then the other thing here

671
01:04:55.80 --> 01:05:03.40
is he doesn't talk about this diet at all and that's clearly equally important and you have to change

672
01:05:05.48 --> 01:05:08.36
your diet if you're going to change your life and you're going to change your health so stop eating

673
01:05:08.36 --> 01:05:13.24
sugar stop eating processed foods no more soda and juices and no more gatorade

674
01:05:15.08 --> 01:05:19.64
just to start with whatever is whatever that it is that you're doing

675
01:05:19.64 --> 01:05:24.20
whoever asks this question whatever you know what you're doing if you're eating donuts

676
01:05:25.40 --> 01:05:30.52
don't don't eat donuts anymore stop just stop eating those get rid of that sugar sweetness

677
01:05:30.52 --> 01:05:37.72
craving thing yeah and then just keep making your diet cleaner and cleaner as time goes by

678
01:05:38.92 --> 01:05:48.12
so that's what I think is there any time that it's good because sometimes I think it's good when

679
01:05:48.12 --> 01:05:55.96
people do go like alright man I'm doing yeah like I whatever happened they went up the staircase and they

680
01:05:55.96 --> 01:06:03.08
they got all tired and they said you know what I'm done yeah it starts tomorrow but I think in

681
01:06:03.08 --> 01:06:09.24
those cases most of the time who was it who was it that we were talking to talking to someone

682
01:06:09.24 --> 01:06:14.36
someone that they are I was talking to someone that their first thing they tried to do they

683
01:06:14.36 --> 01:06:21.24
couldn't do it all like they tried to run three miles and they were like you know what can't do it

684
01:06:21.24 --> 01:06:25.80
can't run three miles oh might have been that guy there's a guy that's losing a bunch of

685
01:06:25.80 --> 01:06:31.96
weight on the interwebs oh yeah that's what I think he's down in Texas but he's trying to lose a lot

686
01:06:31.96 --> 01:06:39.08
of weight and your first time we went try to go for run didn't happen didn't happen so he had to

687
01:06:39.08 --> 01:06:48.36
just run less or he had to just walk actually so yeah you start with what you can do but there

688
01:06:48.36 --> 01:06:55.80
is a little bit of there is there is I would try I would say this keep this one in the in the back of

689
01:06:55.80 --> 01:07:01.40
your mind there is the whole thing of like you know what I'm changing my life right now you go home

690
01:07:01.40 --> 01:07:05.64
you get the garbage can out you bring it into the kitchen you throw away the twinkies you throw away

691
01:07:05.64 --> 01:07:11.56
the pop-tarts you throw away the the you pour the the crappy soda down the drain and you get on the

692
01:07:11.56 --> 01:07:17.64
path and you just don't look back yeah that's a good thing to do too yeah but again if that person's

693
01:07:17.64 --> 01:07:24.92
300 pounds they're not gonna be able to do I mean they're gonna push themselves yeah they could

694
01:07:24.92 --> 01:07:30.52
push themselves too hard so you just gotta be careful yeah so and that it's funny when um when I'm

695
01:07:30.52 --> 01:07:36.44
kind of looking at the question I'm like well obviously you want to start slow right obviously but then

696
01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:40.84
I don't know you hear about these guys just like how you said they just they throw everything away

697
01:07:40.84 --> 01:07:45.48
they're like I'm a different person right I think I think we're we're crossing streams here

698
01:07:45.48 --> 01:07:52.44
are I am there's diet and then there's like workout yeah because diet you can pretty much go

699
01:07:52.44 --> 01:07:58.28
cold turkey today yeah it lets and you may or may not be able to relate to this but if you go

700
01:07:58.28 --> 01:08:04.60
straight extreme on your diet like all of a sudden you're hit with these the byproducts of

701
01:08:04.60 --> 01:08:09.56
changing your diet especially if you if you'd like like mountain do every single day

702
01:08:09.56 --> 01:08:13.80
right and you just all of a sudden boom stop drinking month you'll go through stuff that you

703
01:08:13.80 --> 01:08:18.12
might not expect like the craving will hit you so hard and then you're gonna be on free and

704
01:08:18.12 --> 01:08:24.60
minimal doses of mountain you know yeah basically basically I'm gonna say no stop drinking

705
01:08:24.60 --> 01:08:28.52
mountain you don't need it and I think and you're gonna go through withdrawals right yeah

706
01:08:28.52 --> 01:08:33.08
if you're caffeine withdrawals and sugar withdrawals you're gonna get the the keto flu and

707
01:08:33.08 --> 01:08:36.92
all those things are gonna happen and it's gonna be rough but yeah but don't just say it like

708
01:08:36.92 --> 01:08:41.16
that it's gonna be rough but that's all good bro seriously if you go into that and you experience

709
01:08:41.16 --> 01:08:45.56
these types of things and then it's gonna apply to everything by the way any big change that you

710
01:08:45.56 --> 01:08:49.24
make where you you have to deprive yourself of these bad things that you've become kind of addicted to

711
01:08:49.24 --> 01:08:53.88
whatever you're gonna go through all kinds of changes and that goes for workout too by the way

712
01:08:53.88 --> 01:08:58.12
because like just the sornus alone oh dang I want to expect in the sornus oh I'm like

713
01:08:58.52 --> 01:09:03.000
tired now because the workout like was kind of hard it's like oh shit I wasn't expecting that I was

714
01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:07.08
expecting to feel right after my workout everyone says whatever so you're gonna run into all

715
01:09:07.08 --> 01:09:10.68
these little things that don't tell you about and then it's like well I didn't sign up for that

716
01:09:10.68 --> 01:09:14.76
little part of it and then when I'm that little part and then you're gonna follow up I think the diet thing

717
01:09:14.76 --> 01:09:19.000
I think you're wrong I think the diet thing I think if you're I think it's very I think it's

718
01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:23.96
easier in fact to just be like I'm done it's not like okay you know what I'm only gonna

719
01:09:23.96 --> 01:09:30.20
get a quarter bag of cheetos a day from now on I don't think that works I think you got to be like

720
01:09:30.20 --> 01:09:37.000
no no no no no cheat us not no cheat us in my house but I do think that you could work out so hard

721
01:09:37.72 --> 01:09:42.36
that you're so sore that you that you say oh man I'm just too kind of like the

722
01:09:42.36 --> 01:09:45.56
Gigi into question earlier on like you could be what if someone's so sore that they can't do

723
01:09:45.56 --> 01:09:53.40
their job right and they're just sore all day at work well that's not cool so I think for diet

724
01:09:53.40 --> 01:10:00.76
you can you can go cold turkey or actually cold steak or hot steak and then I think for working

725
01:10:00.76 --> 01:10:07.88
out is the one you you you you figure out what you can do and you push a little bit harder but you

726
01:10:07.88 --> 01:10:13.96
don't go level nine maximum destruction madness I think you're wrong respectfully and which part do you

727
01:10:13.96 --> 01:10:20.36
think I'm wrong on diet I think if you go extreme with your diet I think it'll work for some people

728
01:10:20.36 --> 01:10:25.80
for sure but depending on who you are but I think you're more if you go extreme with the diet you

729
01:10:25.80 --> 01:10:29.80
don't like slowly phase out of the way you know it's interesting you know it's interesting I don't

730
01:10:29.80 --> 01:10:34.52
know if you remember I read a letter while back on the podcast about a guy that had read way

731
01:10:34.52 --> 01:10:42.04
the warrior kid and he like fixed his life and that guy did what you're saying he just made little

732
01:10:42.04 --> 01:10:48.68
changes you know he made little changes along the way so maybe it's person it's probably personality

733
01:10:48.68 --> 01:10:53.16
in fact let's just go ahead and say it's personality some people are going to just have to get

734
01:10:53.16 --> 01:10:58.20
the damn cheetos out of their house all of them yeah and some people say you know what I'm only

735
01:10:58.20 --> 01:11:05.48
going to have this one cup full of cheetos every day yeah and even that's okay but but here's where

736
01:11:05.48 --> 01:11:12.36
you got to be careful you may lie to yourself and you can lie to yourself yeah you can lie to yourself

737
01:11:12.36 --> 01:11:17.64
and they're like you know I don't really think that that that big of a deal today if I just have two cups of cheetos

738
01:11:17.64 --> 01:11:23.24
yeah yeah yeah nine cups of cheetos later you know what you see and then two cups and

739
01:11:23.24 --> 01:11:29.56
respectfully I don't like your cheetos example why because you're like I'm going to allow myself

740
01:11:29.56 --> 01:11:34.20
cheat okay don't allow yourself cheetos that's not how small of a change you're going to make

741
01:11:34.20 --> 01:11:37.000
if you're not going to eat cheetos anymore you're not going to eat cheetos anymore I'm saying like

742
01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:40.92
if you go extreme on your diet let's say you eat but but when you say what you're saying

743
01:11:40.92 --> 01:11:50.76
is hey I'm going to change my diet okay I used to eat every day I eat a whole bag of cheetos

744
01:11:52.20 --> 01:11:57.48
and now I'm only going to eat one cup of cheetos from the bag of day that's improvement it

745
01:11:57.48 --> 01:12:02.20
is improved and it's small improvement and if I could do that then why why is that not okay yeah

746
01:12:02.20 --> 01:12:06.76
okay if you choose to do that but okay now we're going into the specifics of a certain

747
01:12:06.76 --> 01:12:12.52
person's okay I think I would say this this is more along lines of what I'm thinking as far as

748
01:12:12.52 --> 01:12:16.12
specific examples if you're going to go if I'm going to eat one bag of cheetos obviously that's not

749
01:12:16.12 --> 01:12:22.28
all I'm eating I'm eating other stuff I'm the small change is I'm not going to eat cheetos anymore

750
01:12:22.28 --> 01:12:27.000
I'm going to cut out cheetos that's it I'm still not eating that good you know I'm going to cut out

751
01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:34.60
cheetos or let's say I get you know drive through every day three times a day okay

752
01:12:34.60 --> 01:12:41.40
I won't get drive through anymore or all that's a big change not necessarily depending on

753
01:12:41.40 --> 01:12:46.92
what you get going from three drive through the day to zero the house that not a big chance it's a big

754
01:12:46.92 --> 01:12:50.92
child is going from like and there's certain people actually I was talking to someone

755
01:12:50.92 --> 01:12:59.24
the other day that had lost 150 pounds of female and it was interesting her nutritionist

756
01:12:59.24 --> 01:13:05.08
she hired an nutritionist and the nutritionist said okay what are the foods you can't live without

757
01:13:05.72 --> 01:13:10.76
and we'll work around those yeah that's pretty cool thank you and what she said was I need cheese

758
01:13:10.76 --> 01:13:16.92
burgers and fries so then what she got told was something along lines of okay you can have cheese

759
01:13:16.92 --> 01:13:24.68
burger and fries on Friday yeah yeah instead of you know this this whole thing of I can never eat it

760
01:13:24.68 --> 01:13:30.28
now what I'm saying is there are people and I think I'm one of these people where it's like oh

761
01:13:30.28 --> 01:13:34.60
if I have cheeseburgers and fries today well then I might as well just get a mint chocolate chip milkshake

762
01:13:34.60 --> 01:13:41.16
with it and if I did that tonight then you know what tomorrow morning hey after you get done training

763
01:13:41.16 --> 01:13:45.24
maybe you know that cheeseburgers good yesterday I've had so maybe it's my own personal weakness

764
01:13:45.88 --> 01:13:51.000
but for me I'd prefer to be just like on the path yeah yeah that's why the 80 20 rule

765
01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:55.48
and I talked about this in the field manual the 80 20 rule maybe it works for some people and I guess it

766
01:13:55.48 --> 01:14:02.20
does work for me but I'd rather just be straight on the program you know what I mean yeah and and then

767
01:14:02.20 --> 01:14:06.76
and you know what you know Tim Ferriss has that thing where or he's talked about that thing where he goes

768
01:14:07.48 --> 01:14:15.32
six days hardcore strict and then the seventh day you literally eat whatever you want as much as you can

769
01:14:15.32 --> 01:14:24.28
and I even tried that I have and it's really really good because you feel really really good not

770
01:14:24.28 --> 01:14:29.72
and it's only physically but just about the whole I'm on the program and you kind of know and on that

771
01:14:29.72 --> 01:14:34.36
on that cheat day you do they call it the cheat day you eat whatever you want and you don't feel any

772
01:14:34.36 --> 01:14:40.76
guilt at all even when you're on the 80 20 it's like you have to become an off a real strong

773
01:14:40.76 --> 01:14:48.68
week to like be to feel good about cheat for three like three burgers are good too yeah and that's

774
01:14:48.68 --> 01:14:54.04
you've been really that bad of a cheat day a cheat day is like fries fries then you're starting to go

775
01:14:54.04 --> 01:14:59.88
into it for sure but the I'm like you know a cheat day cheat day like asked Tim held

776
01:15:00.60 --> 01:15:05.80
it'll be like for like a whole thing of donuts re box a cook yeah whatever you want straight up

777
01:15:05.80 --> 01:15:09.80
whatever you want this is disgusting here's the thing though with when you when you start to eat

778
01:15:09.80 --> 01:15:15.16
healthy and you then you try to eat a whole box of donuts you're after like one two three maybe six

779
01:15:15.16 --> 01:15:21.48
eight donuts you're gonna be like you know you're in six donuts easy you're in six donuts in one

780
01:15:21.48 --> 01:15:25.80
oh my gosh you know those I think they're called Intimins Old Fashion they're you know

781
01:15:25.80 --> 01:15:30.52
we'll know that you know little chocolate Domets you know what a total full size donut straight

782
01:15:30.52 --> 01:15:38.76
up they're kind of a little bigger too you know you know oh you know oh you know I can't even

783
01:15:38.76 --> 01:15:44.36
fat of eating six donuts ever since I started talking so much smack about donuts yeah I

784
01:15:44.36 --> 01:15:48.36
know I can't literally can never have when you get in my life yeah you're not allowed for sure

785
01:15:48.36 --> 01:15:54.36
100% yeah you know yeah even if you were like if someone was like hey just bumping

786
01:15:54.36 --> 01:15:58.84
in the back when I was a little kid my parents would buy the chocolate doughnuts the host's chocolate

787
01:15:58.84 --> 01:16:03.16
yeah that's like what we'll covered in chocolate those things are good yeah yeah yeah you can't even

788
01:16:03.16 --> 01:16:09.000
have one of those again no no you know I did the six day cheat program no even then okay I can't do it

789
01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:15.16
you know you know the old fashion donut is right it's like a don't with the whole it right

790
01:16:15.16 --> 01:16:19.88
no it's called old fashion donuts they're like um it's they're kind of glazed and almost like

791
01:16:19.88 --> 01:16:24.52
not they're not crispy but they're kind of hardy are hard and okay on the outside and then

792
01:16:24.52 --> 01:16:29.08
they're regular soft donuts and then they say and they have this glaze or um okay so I think it's

793
01:16:29.08 --> 01:16:33.72
I forget the name I think it might be vitamins but they have old fashion donuts where they're not

794
01:16:33.72 --> 01:16:38.20
as hard but they're kind of hard and they're just bigger anyway those are my favorite ones

795
01:16:38.20 --> 01:16:41.72
and I used to get chocolate milk and heat up the chocolate milk so it's like hot chocolate and

796
01:16:41.72 --> 01:16:47.24
donuts and oh yeah I easy money like I'll eat two bucks for those for sure oh I used to

797
01:16:47.24 --> 01:16:55.56
now yeah so the point there is on the cheat day you just go yeah no shame but after the things

798
01:16:55.56 --> 01:16:59.80
you can't just eat donuts four times a day or three you just don't feel good like your stomach

799
01:16:59.80 --> 01:17:04.36
gets all upset and the more healthy you eat the more it's gonna be like that so the longer you're

800
01:17:04.36 --> 01:17:10.04
on the path you straight like if you ate some donut like the other day we went to the

801
01:17:10.04 --> 01:17:14.28
Belmont Park and I ate some ice cream some mid-chocolate chip ice cream was it good

802
01:17:14.28 --> 01:17:19.80
fine it was good but you know the kids are doing whatever's tracks the other night

803
01:17:19.80 --> 01:17:23.96
yeah you eat a big large double you know what after after that you're like

804
01:17:23.96 --> 01:17:27.64
but I don't feel right you know so unless you're just committed to eat it because I don't

805
01:17:27.64 --> 01:17:31.32
know you don't want to waste it or something like that you're gonna be like oh my cheat your

806
01:17:31.32 --> 01:17:35.88
cheat day is not gonna be that bad it's what I'm saying okay but I know you have that

807
01:17:35.88 --> 01:17:40.84
we don't make it happen depends on what it is yeah yeah yeah you could pump some chili fries or something

808
01:17:40.84 --> 01:17:49.16
I don't like chili fries all right so yeah maybe what's the verdict I think just in the like

809
01:17:49.16 --> 01:17:54.60
middle of the road not the whole story like same thing I said balance so you're saying balance as

810
01:17:54.60 --> 01:17:59.16
well I'll tell you though man if that balance doesn't work for you you're gonna have to step it up

811
01:17:59.16 --> 01:18:04.76
you're gonna have to go hardcore I'd give yourself two weeks two weeks for a balanced approach

812
01:18:04.76 --> 01:18:09.48
on the diet side if you can't get your shit under control in two weeks you got to go

813
01:18:09.48 --> 01:18:14.04
hardcore you got to get in there with a garbage client can throw away the Twinkies throw away

814
01:18:14.04 --> 01:18:20.52
everything else that's crap in your fridge and go hardcore and start with a fast too right

815
01:18:20.52 --> 01:18:26.60
you know hey a fast is awesome a fast for a good way wait I don't even know that there's that much

816
01:18:26.60 --> 01:18:31.96
to expect don't ever for a day if you never done it before it's not that bad of a deal there's no

817
01:18:31.96 --> 01:18:37.96
little stuff don't eat your day there's little there's not take you from a normal human being

818
01:18:37.96 --> 01:18:44.04
this little stuff that you if you're not if you go in and not prepared for it then you're like

819
01:18:44.04 --> 01:18:48.44
I actually think the more you think about it prepared for it the more psychologically or it is

820
01:18:48.44 --> 01:18:52.28
yeah just be like oh yeah you know what I woke up this morning I haven't eaten last night

821
01:18:52.28 --> 01:18:57.32
call I'm not gonna eat until tonight every time that's a fast yes so when I'm trying to like that

822
01:18:57.32 --> 01:19:01.32
when I'm like I'm not gonna eat till this then I go through little stuff but if I just happen if I'm

823
01:19:01.32 --> 01:19:06.52
two into work I'm only drinking coffee and I forget and like dang if if I eat not having

824
01:19:06.52 --> 01:19:11.40
an eight for like you know 12 hours 16 then I'll be like oh I'll just go another three that's my

825
01:19:11.40 --> 01:19:16.52
15 because like 15 right 15 hours is when your body starts to kind of shift over to like

826
01:19:16.52 --> 01:19:23.80
I think 15 okay so I'll just wait that shower it's like cool done but if we're playing it that's

827
01:19:23.80 --> 01:19:29.40
when yeah I don't know but it depends on who you are but that's like I agree with the fast off

828
01:19:29.40 --> 01:19:35.56
yeah I agree with a kick things off and get like jump onto the path yeah this jump on with a fast

829
01:19:35.56 --> 01:19:41.24
yeah hey go see your doctor whatever do you have to go see a doctor to fast 24 hours

830
01:19:41.24 --> 01:19:49.56
I think you should if you've been probably yeah yeah yeah yeah a fat lazy you know especially if

831
01:19:49.56 --> 01:19:53.40
you're older or something like that I think seen a doctor is it how old is it to get a personal trainer

832
01:19:55.16 --> 01:19:58.76
depends on when you need to help me the woman I just talk to she's like personal trainer

833
01:19:58.76 --> 01:20:05.000
and nutritionist hired them both lost 100 whatever pounds so yeah I think she was an

834
01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:11.80
excessive 300 pounds yeah and when I matter she's completely normal right like you know completely

835
01:20:11.80 --> 01:20:16.68
like you wouldn't even suspect that she had any weight trouble in her life yeah that's pretty amazing yeah

836
01:20:16.68 --> 01:20:24.20
so hire the trainer hire the the nutritionist yeah I think so I think that helps

837
01:20:24.84 --> 01:20:30.44
I always looked at it like why would I hire like a trainer or something like that when I can

838
01:20:30.44 --> 01:20:35.96
kind of look up that stuff but here's the thing I went in with this bias like because I kind

839
01:20:35.96 --> 01:20:40.60
of had a background in it so I'm like why would I I can just go look but I'm looking it up but I have

840
01:20:40.60 --> 01:20:46.04
all this other knowledge the same rule you try it for two weeks see if you can keep yourself

841
01:20:46.04 --> 01:20:52.92
on the path and if you can't got to bring someone in right here's what I like hire a trainer

842
01:20:52.92 --> 01:20:57.24
but not like the kind every day it's like a once a week trainer who can get you on a little program

843
01:20:57.24 --> 01:21:03.08
yeah yeah yeah yeah you know it's gonna depend on who you're straight up you don't who can keep you on

844
01:21:03.72 --> 01:21:09.000
yeah that's the biggest part of all this and I've said this a billion times like you know what you

845
01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:14.84
need to do yeah you know what you need to do you know you know what you need to do if you can't get

846
01:21:14.84 --> 01:21:20.44
yourself to do it maybe you need to get someone to help you do it yeah the weird thing is like

847
01:21:20.44 --> 01:21:23.56
nutritionist and stuff you can get nutritionist that could come to you and be like okay we're

848
01:21:23.56 --> 01:21:28.44
gonna put you on a low fat diet you know what you'd be really not good seeing you in the wrong

849
01:21:28.44 --> 01:21:31.88
there yeah I don't know how many you think there's still nutritionists that are doing that right now

850
01:21:31.88 --> 01:21:36.44
oh yeah there are I know there are actually there are out there so you're gonna be careful right

851
01:21:38.12 --> 01:21:46.20
check next question last thing that I'm not gonna draw it out but you said

852
01:21:46.20 --> 01:21:53.64
you know what you need to do and one time you said imagine what your day would look like like

853
01:21:53.64 --> 01:22:00.60
if you like everything you did was you did the things that you knew you're supposed to do kind of

854
01:22:00.60 --> 01:22:08.92
thing well the the full the full statement is if you wrote down tonight what you were supposed to do tomorrow

855
01:22:08.92 --> 01:22:14.44
yeah and then you did the things that you were supposed to do yeah imagine how that day would feel

856
01:22:14.44 --> 01:22:19.64
and imagine what you'd get done in that day yeah and then imagine if you did that every day for

857
01:22:19.64 --> 01:22:24.44
a week yeah and imagine if you did that every day for a month and they did it for a year and

858
01:22:24.44 --> 01:22:27.96
imagine where your life would be your life would be in a completely different trajectory completely

859
01:22:27.96 --> 01:22:32.28
completely different yeah and that's true with working out that's true with nutrition that's true

860
01:22:32.28 --> 01:22:37.96
with business that's true with education that's true with knowledge to with everything everything

861
01:22:37.96 --> 01:22:42.36
yeah kind of know what we're supposed to do yeah well I thought you were going to say

862
01:22:42.36 --> 01:22:44.16
some people don't know what to do.

863
01:22:44.16 --> 01:22:45.16
I'm not could be the case.

864
01:22:45.16 --> 01:22:47.44
Some people they've never worked out before.

865
01:22:47.44 --> 01:22:50.28
And if you're a person that's never worked out before,

866
01:22:50.28 --> 01:22:52.28
you probably need to bring someone into the game

867
01:22:52.28 --> 01:22:54.28
that's gonna help show you how to work out.

868
01:22:54.28 --> 01:22:58.96
If you've never done any reading about eating,

869
01:22:58.96 --> 01:23:01.28
and you have no idea what's gonna be good for you,

870
01:23:01.28 --> 01:23:03.36
you're probably a person that might need to bring someone

871
01:23:03.36 --> 01:23:05.56
into the game to help you get over that.

872
01:23:05.56 --> 01:23:08.52
Yeah, and it still completely goes with exactly what you said.

873
01:23:08.52 --> 01:23:10.24
It's like you know what to do,

874
01:23:10.24 --> 01:23:12.48
and even to help that, you know what not to do.

875
01:23:12.48 --> 01:23:14.40
Like when you're about to make decisions on me do this,

876
01:23:14.40 --> 01:23:16.76
or not do this, like you know which one is you should

877
01:23:16.76 --> 01:23:17.80
or shouldn't do.

878
01:23:17.80 --> 01:23:20.24
So let's say I don't know anything about working out,

879
01:23:20.24 --> 01:23:22.16
but I know I have to get in shape.

880
01:23:22.16 --> 01:23:23.000
We all know.

881
01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:24.44
We all know when we gotta get in shape.

882
01:23:24.44 --> 01:23:26.36
So then you know you gotta hire somebody.

883
01:23:26.36 --> 01:23:27.64
You know you gotta do something.

884
01:23:27.64 --> 01:23:29.32
You know that you shouldn't just be like,

885
01:23:29.32 --> 01:23:30.16
oh well, I'm not gonna do it.

886
01:23:30.16 --> 01:23:31.04
I don't know, I'm not gonna do it.

887
01:23:31.04 --> 01:23:32.36
Things to do tomorrow.

888
01:23:32.36 --> 01:23:33.16
Yeah, the trainer.

889
01:23:33.16 --> 01:23:34.000
Yeah.

890
01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.16
Join a gym, get a trainer.

891
01:23:36.16 --> 01:23:37.56
Yeah, I don't know what to do.

892
01:23:37.56 --> 01:23:38.76
Okay, this is what you can do.

893
01:23:38.76 --> 01:23:39.84
Find out what to do.

894
01:23:39.84 --> 01:23:40.68
There you go.

895
01:23:40.68 --> 01:23:41.96
Then in that case.

896
01:23:41.96 --> 01:23:43.16
So you gotta make sense.

897
01:23:43.16 --> 01:23:45.80
Sometimes when you put things in, just say stuff,

898
01:23:45.80 --> 01:23:47.08
just put it on the table.

899
01:23:47.08 --> 01:23:48.32
Just starts to make sense.

900
01:23:48.32 --> 01:23:49.48
Mm-hmm.

901
01:23:49.48 --> 01:23:50.64
Next question.

902
01:23:50.64 --> 01:23:52.88
I'm a veteran of the infantry,

903
01:23:52.88 --> 01:23:55.80
and when I took over a fire team

904
01:23:55.80 --> 01:23:57.72
for the first time, I made the mistake of drawing

905
01:23:57.72 --> 01:23:59.36
hard lines in the sand.

906
01:24:00.48 --> 01:24:04.04
This immediately alienated members of that team

907
01:24:04.04 --> 01:24:05.84
that had been together for some time.

908
01:24:05.84 --> 01:24:08.48
I did not make that mistake again,

909
01:24:08.48 --> 01:24:11.40
and I definitely learned from my experience.

910
01:24:11.40 --> 01:24:13.60
So clearly there's not a question there.

911
01:24:13.60 --> 01:24:14.44
Yeah.

912
01:24:14.44 --> 01:24:17.60
And I forget pulling this out from,

913
01:24:17.60 --> 01:24:19.96
I get a lot of emails and messages and all that,

914
01:24:19.96 --> 01:24:23.32
but I thought it was a good point to bring up

915
01:24:23.32 --> 01:24:28.32
to say, this idea of drawing hard lines in the sand,

916
01:24:28.32 --> 01:24:31.08
and what that does to your leadership position.

917
01:24:31.08 --> 01:24:33.08
It's difficult.

918
01:24:33.08 --> 01:24:34.76
It's usually not a good thing to do.

919
01:24:34.76 --> 01:24:36.68
If you draw a lot of hard lines in the sand,

920
01:24:36.68 --> 01:24:40.32
and eventually you realize that they're either

921
01:24:40.32 --> 01:24:42.96
unrealistic or people can't maintain them,

922
01:24:42.96 --> 01:24:45.12
you're set yourself up for failure.

923
01:24:45.12 --> 01:24:46.72
What is that exactly like drawing lines?

924
01:24:46.72 --> 01:24:48.88
So it's a no matter what.

925
01:24:48.88 --> 01:24:52.04
We will not go to blah blah.

926
01:24:52.04 --> 01:24:54.80
Yeah, there's the like no matter what.

927
01:24:54.80 --> 01:24:58.72
We will win every single road march

928
01:24:58.72 --> 01:25:01.68
that we do as a fire team in this while we're here.

929
01:25:01.68 --> 01:25:03.52
Oh, it's training thing.

930
01:25:03.52 --> 01:25:04.36
Okay.

931
01:25:04.36 --> 01:25:05.20
Well, guess what?

932
01:25:05.20 --> 01:25:07.44
That's a hard field.

933
01:25:07.44 --> 01:25:09.24
There's other, there's some other fire teams

934
01:25:09.24 --> 01:25:11.44
that are also want to win.

935
01:25:11.44 --> 01:25:13.36
And so you've drawn a hard line to say,

936
01:25:13.36 --> 01:25:14.92
and that's not really a good example.

937
01:25:17.04 --> 01:25:18.76
A good example will take no matter what.

938
01:25:18.76 --> 01:25:21.72
We're gonna muster every morning at 4.30 in the morning.

939
01:25:21.72 --> 01:25:22.68
No matter what.

940
01:25:23.96 --> 01:25:26.68
And you know, then the guys are out on patrol

941
01:25:26.68 --> 01:25:29.44
until 2.38 in the morning.

942
01:25:29.44 --> 01:25:31.56
And now the next morning, a good no matter what.

943
01:25:31.56 --> 01:25:32.40
I say no matter what.

944
01:25:32.40 --> 01:25:34.16
Well, it's not good for them.

945
01:25:34.16 --> 01:25:35.92
It's unrealistic.

946
01:25:35.92 --> 01:25:37.84
So you drew a hard line in the sand

947
01:25:37.84 --> 01:25:39.72
and now you got to back it down.

948
01:25:39.72 --> 01:25:42.32
So and all you have to do is soften the statement a little bit.

949
01:25:42.32 --> 01:25:44.84
Hey guys, to the best of our ability, if we can,

950
01:25:44.84 --> 01:25:47.48
we're gonna get here every morning at 4.30 for monster.

951
01:25:47.48 --> 01:25:51.48
There's a little, there's a little room to play there, right?

952
01:25:51.48 --> 01:25:53.52
And that's, that's fine.

953
01:25:53.52 --> 01:25:58.52
So again, there's, there's not a lot of,

954
01:25:58.68 --> 01:25:59.84
there's not a question here.

955
01:25:59.84 --> 01:26:01.80
But one of the reasons I think that,

956
01:26:01.80 --> 01:26:06.24
that I wanted to talk about it was because I think people look at me.

957
01:26:06.24 --> 01:26:07.24
Yeah.

958
01:26:07.24 --> 01:26:10.44
And even hear me on a peripheral level.

959
01:26:10.44 --> 01:26:12.24
And they think all, I bet, John,

960
01:26:12.24 --> 01:26:14.48
would just lay down the hard lines.

961
01:26:14.48 --> 01:26:18.84
It's my way or the highway, right?

962
01:26:18.84 --> 01:26:19.84
Yeah.

963
01:26:19.84 --> 01:26:23.32
And the, the opposite is actually true.

964
01:26:23.32 --> 01:26:29.04
And the reason that I came to that conclusion

965
01:26:29.04 --> 01:26:32.84
was because I worked for leaders like that

966
01:26:32.84 --> 01:26:35.68
and I hated working for leaders like that.

967
01:26:35.68 --> 01:26:38.72
So I tried to never be a leader like that.

968
01:26:41.36 --> 01:26:44.12
And there's a dichotomy, right?

969
01:26:44.12 --> 01:26:46.16
There's a huge dichotomy.

970
01:26:46.16 --> 01:26:49.84
Because this doesn't mean that you're not driving and pushing.

971
01:26:49.84 --> 01:26:51.20
This doesn't mean that you're not saying,

972
01:26:51.20 --> 01:26:52.64
hey, we're gonna be the best,

973
01:26:52.64 --> 01:26:55.28
whatever, we're gonna be the best task unit here.

974
01:26:55.28 --> 01:26:56.48
Doesn't mean you're not saying,

975
01:26:56.48 --> 01:26:58.24
hey, look, we're not gonna rest

976
01:26:58.24 --> 01:26:59.64
until we've done what we're supposed to do.

977
01:26:59.64 --> 01:27:00.64
Doesn't mean that.

978
01:27:00.64 --> 01:27:01.48
Mm.

979
01:27:03.12 --> 01:27:05.16
But man, you gotta find that balance.

980
01:27:05.16 --> 01:27:06.000
Yeah.

981
01:27:07.68 --> 01:27:09.28
It does feel like that with you.

982
01:27:10.48 --> 01:27:11.80
That you're like, it feels like that,

983
01:27:11.80 --> 01:27:13.20
but when you're one, I mean,

984
01:27:13.20 --> 01:27:15.36
my experience obviously is,

985
01:27:15.36 --> 01:27:19.24
we're under no extreme circumstances.

986
01:27:19.24 --> 01:27:20.08
Right.

987
01:27:20.08 --> 01:27:21.000
But just like just like the simple stuff.

988
01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.72
Like it really does seem like you wake up at 430 in the morning.

989
01:27:23.72 --> 01:27:26.28
Every single morning, do or die.

990
01:27:26.28 --> 01:27:27.12
100%.

991
01:27:27.12 --> 01:27:27.72
That I did.

992
01:27:27.72 --> 01:27:28.56
That I do.

993
01:27:28.56 --> 01:27:31.68
Oh, unless like there's sometimes where I get home at,

994
01:27:31.68 --> 01:27:33.24
like I remember a little while ago,

995
01:27:33.24 --> 01:27:36.48
I got home at 1 o'clock or 2 o'clock in the morning.

996
01:27:36.48 --> 01:27:38.76
And that's basically my cut off zone.

997
01:27:38.76 --> 01:27:41.96
If I'm getting less than 4.5 hours of sleep,

998
01:27:41.96 --> 01:27:44.40
then I'll be like, oh, yeah, I'll wake up

999
01:27:44.40 --> 01:27:45.64
and I've been like, hey,

1000
01:27:45.64 --> 01:27:47.96
I only got 2.5 hours of sleep last night.

1001
01:27:47.96 --> 01:27:48.84
That's not enough.

1002
01:27:48.84 --> 01:27:50.16
I'm going back to bed.

1003
01:27:50.16 --> 01:27:51.56
Right, that's what I mean.

1004
01:27:51.56 --> 01:27:53.56
Where I've tweeted that out before.

1005
01:27:53.56 --> 01:27:55.08
Yeah, I'm the entire.

1006
01:27:55.08 --> 01:27:56.24
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

1007
01:27:56.24 --> 01:27:57.28
that's what I mean.

1008
01:27:57.28 --> 01:27:57.80
Yeah.

1009
01:27:57.80 --> 01:27:59.36
So it's like when that happens,

1010
01:27:59.36 --> 01:28:01.92
it almost like it catches you off guard, you know,

1011
01:28:01.92 --> 01:28:03.60
when you when you did that,

1012
01:28:03.60 --> 01:28:05.20
I mean, obviously not like, oh,

1013
01:28:05.20 --> 01:28:08.36
drop cool start, it's not that feeling at all.

1014
01:28:08.36 --> 01:28:09.80
It's just kind of like, oh, dang.

1015
01:28:10.96 --> 01:28:13.44
You do have that flexibility when, you know,

1016
01:28:13.44 --> 01:28:15.80
when it's the correct thing, kind of thing.

1017
01:28:15.80 --> 01:28:17.68
Yeah, you have to.

1018
01:28:17.68 --> 01:28:20.16
Yeah, you're not a slave to your, uh,

1019
01:28:21.28 --> 01:28:22.12
rigidity.

1020
01:28:22.12 --> 01:28:24.92
Well, what you're saying is I don't draw hard lines

1021
01:28:24.92 --> 01:28:26.04
in the sand.

1022
01:28:26.04 --> 01:28:27.44
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1023
01:28:27.44 --> 01:28:28.28
Really?

1024
01:28:28.28 --> 01:28:30.12
Yes, exactly right.

1025
01:28:30.12 --> 01:28:32.000
But it's real easy to go down the slippery slope

1026
01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:33.12
of like, well, you know what,

1027
01:28:34.32 --> 01:28:36.68
I actually didn't eat real good yesterday,

1028
01:28:36.68 --> 01:28:39.000
so I probably need some more sleep to recover today.

1029
01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:39.60
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1030
01:28:39.60 --> 01:28:40.76
Really?

1031
01:28:40.76 --> 01:28:43.20
Yeah, well, I am, it's a rest day.

1032
01:28:43.20 --> 01:28:44.64
So I might as well turn on the TV.

1033
01:28:44.64 --> 01:28:46.80
You know, I'd be good with TV's maybe some popcorn.

1034
01:28:46.80 --> 01:28:48.08
Oh, you know, it'd be good with some popcorn,

1035
01:28:48.08 --> 01:28:49.76
maybe some cheese sticks.

1036
01:28:49.76 --> 01:28:51.40
And some other setups.

1037
01:28:51.40 --> 01:28:52.92
It's a rest day, right?

1038
01:28:52.92 --> 01:28:53.76
Yeah, yeah.

1039
01:28:53.76 --> 01:28:56.12
I'm looking for wrong path. It's only free.

1040
01:28:56.12 --> 01:28:56.96
It's only saying.

1041
01:28:56.96 --> 01:29:00.04
I guess the opposite of the, of the path

1042
01:29:00.04 --> 01:29:01.32
is the slippery slope.

1043
01:29:01.32 --> 01:29:03.68
Exactly right.

1044
01:29:05.84 --> 01:29:06.56
Next question.

1045
01:29:06.56 --> 01:29:08.48
Hi, scenario.

1046
01:29:08.48 --> 01:29:10.56
It's actually legit way to think of it, too.

1047
01:29:10.56 --> 01:29:11.16
Yeah.

1048
01:29:11.16 --> 01:29:13.40
If it's a legit way to think of things,

1049
01:29:13.40 --> 01:29:16.20
if you're on the path, when you know what the path is

1050
01:29:16.20 --> 01:29:18.04
as we talked about with Tim Ferriss,

1051
01:29:18.04 --> 01:29:20.88
if you're on the path, which you know,

1052
01:29:21.92 --> 01:29:23.24
when you step off the path,

1053
01:29:23.24 --> 01:29:24.48
it's a slippery slope.

1054
01:29:24.48 --> 01:29:26.60
You know, it's off the path.

1055
01:29:26.60 --> 01:29:28.24
Is a slippery slippery slope?

1056
01:29:28.24 --> 01:29:28.84
Yeah.

1057
01:29:28.84 --> 01:29:29.92
What'd you just say?

1058
01:29:29.92 --> 01:29:32.16
The popcorn can lead to cheats sticks

1059
01:29:32.16 --> 01:29:34.28
can lead to paminums.

1060
01:29:34.28 --> 01:29:35.76
That's the slippery slope right there.

1061
01:29:35.76 --> 01:29:36.44
Yeah.

1062
01:29:36.44 --> 01:29:40.44
And sometimes you slip so hard that you just plunge deep.

1063
01:29:42.56 --> 01:29:43.96
Off the path.

1064
01:29:43.96 --> 01:29:44.80
Yeah.

1065
01:29:44.80 --> 01:29:45.80
Fall off the wagon land hard.

1066
01:29:47.52 --> 01:29:48.20
scenario.

1067
01:29:48.20 --> 01:29:51.24
My team leaders boss came to me and asked my opinion

1068
01:29:51.24 --> 01:29:54.08
on my horrible team leader.

1069
01:29:54.08 --> 01:29:56.88
Okay, the boss is boss.

1070
01:29:56.88 --> 01:29:57.56
One of my opinions.

1071
01:29:57.56 --> 01:29:58.56
So what do I do?

1072
01:29:58.56 --> 01:30:01.92
Praise him to make the team look good and maintain my relationship

1073
01:30:01.92 --> 01:30:05.52
with my with the team leader or tackfully tell the truth

1074
01:30:05.52 --> 01:30:08.08
and build a relationship with the boss with my boss's

1075
01:30:08.08 --> 01:30:09.08
ball.

1076
01:30:09.08 --> 01:30:09.44
Hey.

1077
01:30:09.44 --> 01:30:10.40
That's a good question, isn't it?

1078
01:30:10.40 --> 01:30:14.000
I think this is a really tough position to be in.

1079
01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:16.68
Because you have to be careful and you have to be balanced.

1080
01:30:16.68 --> 01:30:18.16
And there's a couple of things to think about.

1081
01:30:18.16 --> 01:30:20.20
First of all, no one likes rats.

1082
01:30:20.20 --> 01:30:20.80
Yeah.

1083
01:30:20.80 --> 01:30:21.80
Right?

1084
01:30:21.80 --> 01:30:24.08
No one likes rats.

1085
01:30:24.08 --> 01:30:27.36
But at the same time, you kind of also have to think about what's

1086
01:30:27.36 --> 01:30:29.76
best for the team.

1087
01:30:29.76 --> 01:30:32.84
On top of and kind of the opposite of no one likes rats is no one likes

1088
01:30:32.84 --> 01:30:34.72
brown nosers.

1089
01:30:34.72 --> 01:30:35.72
No.

1090
01:30:35.72 --> 01:30:38.32
But at the same time, you have to build relationships up and down

1091
01:30:38.32 --> 01:30:39.32
the chain of command.

1092
01:30:39.32 --> 01:30:43.12
And one of the toughest things about this and what you have to be so

1093
01:30:43.12 --> 01:30:46.40
careful about is that you don't know what kind of relationship the

1094
01:30:46.40 --> 01:30:48.28
boss and the team leader have.

1095
01:30:48.28 --> 01:30:50.000
You don't know.

1096
01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:51.000
I'll one end of the spectrum.

1097
01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:52.60
They could be friends.

1098
01:30:52.60 --> 01:30:55.20
So if you say something bad about them, that's going right back to the

1099
01:30:55.20 --> 01:30:58.20
team leader and you're going to have a hard time.

1100
01:30:58.20 --> 01:31:00.56
You're in a much worse position.

1101
01:31:00.56 --> 01:31:04.32
Also, they could be enemies.

1102
01:31:04.32 --> 01:31:10.48
And supporting the team lead to the boss could actually make you look

1103
01:31:10.48 --> 01:31:11.48
stupid, right?

1104
01:31:11.48 --> 01:31:15.20
Make you look bad.

1105
01:31:15.20 --> 01:31:19.68
And it's important to say here.

1106
01:31:19.68 --> 01:31:23.76
Is it the optics of like I don't want to look bad?

1107
01:31:23.76 --> 01:31:25.84
Is that what I'm talking about?

1108
01:31:25.84 --> 01:31:26.68
Because that's what I just said.

1109
01:31:26.68 --> 01:31:27.68
Like it'll make you look bad.

1110
01:31:27.68 --> 01:31:29.92
It'll make you look stupid.

1111
01:31:29.92 --> 01:31:33.40
The reason that you're trying to look good is because you want to do a

1112
01:31:33.40 --> 01:31:36.28
good job because you want the team because you want the mission succeed.

1113
01:31:36.28 --> 01:31:38.68
That's what's important.

1114
01:31:38.68 --> 01:31:39.60
And you don't care.

1115
01:31:39.60 --> 01:31:41.92
I don't care if I have to eat crow.

1116
01:31:41.92 --> 01:31:42.92
I don't care.

1117
01:31:42.92 --> 01:31:46.96
So I don't mind looking bad if it's for a good reason.

1118
01:31:46.96 --> 01:31:49.64
I don't mind my ego taking a ding if it's for the right reason.

1119
01:31:49.64 --> 01:31:56.04
But this could actually hurt the way I do my job.

1120
01:31:56.04 --> 01:31:59.48
Because now my boss, sorry, my boss is boss.

1121
01:31:59.48 --> 01:32:01.36
Things I'm kind of an idiot.

1122
01:32:01.36 --> 01:32:04.64
And so that means when comes time for promotion, even though I might be the best guy,

1123
01:32:04.64 --> 01:32:07.96
I'm not getting promoted because I was the guy that was too blind to see that my team leader

1124
01:32:07.96 --> 01:32:10.56
wasn't idiot.

1125
01:32:10.56 --> 01:32:19.36
So I would be very careful and fairly neutral in what I said, especially to start with,

1126
01:32:19.36 --> 01:32:20.36
right?

1127
01:32:20.36 --> 01:32:24.64
So if the boss says, hey, how's that team leader doing?

1128
01:32:24.64 --> 01:32:28.000
My response to be like, oh, you know what we get the job done.

1129
01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:30.88
There's that's so non-committal, right?

1130
01:32:30.88 --> 01:32:32.96
What about the team leader?

1131
01:32:32.96 --> 01:32:34.68
Is he a good leader?

1132
01:32:34.68 --> 01:32:38.32
I think he's, I think he's got a pretty good hold of what's going on.

1133
01:32:38.32 --> 01:32:41.68
So that's, there's room to interpret that in any direction.

1134
01:32:41.68 --> 01:32:42.68
Really?

1135
01:32:42.68 --> 01:32:44.000
I think he's got a pretty good hold.

1136
01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:47.36
I think he's getting a hold of what's going on.

1137
01:32:47.36 --> 01:32:52.80
Or another one would be, well, hey, how's your team leader?

1138
01:32:52.80 --> 01:32:56.84
I think our performance kind of shows where we're at, right?

1139
01:32:56.84 --> 01:32:59.16
So you're not, you're not giving away.

1140
01:32:59.16 --> 01:33:02.96
And those are, those, like I said, those are subtle and those are very open things that

1141
01:33:02.96 --> 01:33:04.56
you could respond to.

1142
01:33:04.56 --> 01:33:12.18
And I think the more your boss probes or the, sorry, the more the team boss team leader's

1143
01:33:12.18 --> 01:33:14.84
boss is probes.

1144
01:33:14.84 --> 01:33:18.64
The more you could open up a little bit still with caution.

1145
01:33:18.64 --> 01:33:25.52
But as you see what the boss's opinion is, you could open up a little bit more and share

1146
01:33:25.52 --> 01:33:28.28
a little bit more of the truth very tactfully.

1147
01:33:28.28 --> 01:33:32.60
Or if, or you could go in the other direction, right?

1148
01:33:32.60 --> 01:33:34.60
If you just, oh, you know, that's my best guy.

1149
01:33:34.60 --> 01:33:36.40
And I've known Bill forever.

1150
01:33:36.40 --> 01:33:41.20
Yeah, Bill's, I brought him here and Bill's going to be, he's going to play.

1151
01:33:41.20 --> 01:33:43.96
So are you going to derail that guy?

1152
01:33:43.96 --> 01:33:48.24
You can, but you're probably going to derail yourself too, because that guy has a legitimate

1153
01:33:48.24 --> 01:33:51.48
relationship with him.

1154
01:33:51.48 --> 01:33:55.80
So that's a tough situation.

1155
01:33:55.80 --> 01:34:01.000
And I would say the best thing to do in this situation is remain as neutral as possible.

1156
01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:04.68
And again, you know what, there's, there's someone that's listening, or to this right now,

1157
01:34:04.68 --> 01:34:07.72
let's go in, oh, Joc was kind of a, Joc was kind of a whim.

1158
01:34:07.72 --> 01:34:09.80
And if I was there, I'd just tell the truth.

1159
01:34:09.80 --> 01:34:11.44
Okay, so let's, let's talk about that.

1160
01:34:11.44 --> 01:34:12.44
Let's talk about what happens.

1161
01:34:12.44 --> 01:34:16.44
Because I've been in that situation more times than I can count where my boss was kind

1162
01:34:16.44 --> 01:34:17.72
of an idiot.

1163
01:34:17.72 --> 01:34:21.16
And I get asked by his boss, hey, how's this guy doing?

1164
01:34:21.16 --> 01:34:23.48
So let's say you rat him out.

1165
01:34:23.48 --> 01:34:25.88
Well does that mean that the boss gets fired immediately?

1166
01:34:25.88 --> 01:34:26.88
No.

1167
01:34:26.88 --> 01:34:29.56
It just means that your team is less respected.

1168
01:34:29.56 --> 01:34:32.60
It means that you get less support.

1169
01:34:32.60 --> 01:34:38.12
It means, and if you do get rat it out by the way, where do you end up now?

1170
01:34:38.12 --> 01:34:44.60
You end up in a bad situation where your boss knows that you ratted him out to his boss.

1171
01:34:44.60 --> 01:34:45.60
You're hated.

1172
01:34:45.60 --> 01:34:46.60
Yeah.

1173
01:34:46.60 --> 01:34:47.60
You're hated.

1174
01:34:47.60 --> 01:34:49.60
So I want to win.

1175
01:34:49.60 --> 01:34:50.60
Let's go back to that point.

1176
01:34:50.60 --> 01:34:51.60
I want to win.

1177
01:34:51.60 --> 01:34:55.52
So does it help me win if I rat out my boss?

1178
01:34:55.52 --> 01:34:57.68
Or if I rat out my team leader to my boss?

1179
01:34:57.68 --> 01:35:01.24
Does it help me win?

1180
01:35:01.24 --> 01:35:07.60
It could, it could if your boss happens to be completely aligned with what you're thinking.

1181
01:35:07.60 --> 01:35:10.04
He also happens to have a replacement ready.

1182
01:35:10.04 --> 01:35:11.36
That's more squared away.

1183
01:35:11.36 --> 01:35:12.36
That's another thing.

1184
01:35:12.36 --> 01:35:13.68
You get rid of one bad team leader.

1185
01:35:13.68 --> 01:35:15.12
Now you get a new team leader.

1186
01:35:15.12 --> 01:35:16.12
How do you know him?

1187
01:35:16.12 --> 01:35:17.12
Who's that?

1188
01:35:17.12 --> 01:35:19.04
Who is that person?

1189
01:35:19.04 --> 01:35:20.04
Where did they come from?

1190
01:35:20.04 --> 01:35:21.80
The devil's, what is that saying?

1191
01:35:21.80 --> 01:35:25.72
The devil you know is better than the devil that you don't know.

1192
01:35:25.72 --> 01:35:30.12
So if I have a team leader that's not doing a good job, who's fault is that?

1193
01:35:30.12 --> 01:35:31.68
Why?

1194
01:35:31.68 --> 01:35:32.84
Yeah.

1195
01:35:32.84 --> 01:35:34.52
I can help my team leader.

1196
01:35:34.52 --> 01:35:36.88
Especially if my team leader is weak, I can help them become strong.

1197
01:35:36.88 --> 01:35:38.28
I can help teach them.

1198
01:35:38.28 --> 01:35:40.64
Taxfully, not stepping on their toes.

1199
01:35:40.64 --> 01:35:46.08
I would rather than rat my team leader out of the chain of command, I would rather fix my

1200
01:35:46.08 --> 01:35:47.44
team leader.

1201
01:35:47.44 --> 01:35:52.000
I would rather help my team leader become better, support them.

1202
01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:55.92
And by the way, when you do support your team leader and they become better and now they

1203
01:35:55.92 --> 01:35:59.64
do come up for promotion, what do they know in the back of their mind?

1204
01:35:59.64 --> 01:36:00.96
They know that you helped them.

1205
01:36:00.96 --> 01:36:02.12
They knew that you got them there.

1206
01:36:02.12 --> 01:36:03.84
Guess who's getting promoted now.

1207
01:36:03.84 --> 01:36:04.84
You are.

1208
01:36:04.84 --> 01:36:06.56
Now why am I so concerned about getting promoted?

1209
01:36:06.56 --> 01:36:09.16
Because I want to want to out do everyone else?

1210
01:36:09.16 --> 01:36:10.52
No, that's not why.

1211
01:36:10.52 --> 01:36:12.32
Because I want to win.

1212
01:36:12.32 --> 01:36:14.52
I want the team to win.

1213
01:36:14.52 --> 01:36:17.04
And if I thought that you echo would do a better job.

1214
01:36:17.04 --> 01:36:20.28
If you became team leader instead of me, I'd be like, hey, I appreciate it.

1215
01:36:20.28 --> 01:36:21.84
But echo would do a better job than me.

1216
01:36:21.84 --> 01:36:24.80
He should be the team leader.

1217
01:36:24.80 --> 01:36:30.88
So and also, if you're really, this is what happens.

1218
01:36:30.88 --> 01:36:33.96
If I'm really a person, this is this is what I'm getting at.

1219
01:36:33.96 --> 01:36:36.52
If I'm really a person that really wants to get promoted, and that's my main goal.

1220
01:36:36.52 --> 01:36:37.52
I want to get promoted.

1221
01:36:37.52 --> 01:36:38.52
That's my goal.

1222
01:36:38.52 --> 01:36:40.52
What do I do with the team leader?

1223
01:36:40.52 --> 01:36:43.84
I throw him under the bus.

1224
01:36:43.84 --> 01:36:46.40
So that's the person that we all hate.

1225
01:36:46.40 --> 01:36:51.80
The person that rats out the team leader that says, oh, that guy's doing a terrible job.

1226
01:36:51.80 --> 01:36:53.80
I do much better job and gets that guy fired.

1227
01:36:53.80 --> 01:36:54.80
Now I get promoted.

1228
01:36:54.80 --> 01:36:56.24
What do we all think of him?

1229
01:36:56.24 --> 01:36:59.04
We all think that guy's a turd.

1230
01:36:59.04 --> 01:37:01.60
Now as opposed to the sum of that says, you know what?

1231
01:37:01.60 --> 01:37:03.92
Our team leader's weak needs help.

1232
01:37:03.92 --> 01:37:05.88
Need support.

1233
01:37:05.88 --> 01:37:06.88
I'm going to help him.

1234
01:37:06.88 --> 01:37:07.88
I'm going to support him.

1235
01:37:07.88 --> 01:37:09.08
I'm going to do the best I can.

1236
01:37:09.08 --> 01:37:10.48
Wait, are you saying to tell the boss this?

1237
01:37:10.48 --> 01:37:12.48
No, it's just having that out of you to have that attitude.

1238
01:37:12.48 --> 01:37:14.48
Like, I'm not going to, I'm not going to film one of the bus.

1239
01:37:14.48 --> 01:37:20.76
Now if we have a guy that's horrible, that's tyrannical, that does a horrible job,

1240
01:37:20.76 --> 01:37:25.28
that abuses people, then we get to a situation where you say, you know what, boss?

1241
01:37:25.28 --> 01:37:26.96
There's some problems.

1242
01:37:26.96 --> 01:37:31.64
So if you have that one, which doesn't really, well, this guy says horrible team leader.

1243
01:37:31.64 --> 01:37:38.12
So if this is a horrible team leader, that's irredeemable, irredeemable qualities, and it's

1244
01:37:38.12 --> 01:37:42.16
negatively affecting the team, because he kind of makes it sound like, make the team look

1245
01:37:42.16 --> 01:37:43.16
good.

1246
01:37:43.16 --> 01:37:45.52
So there's, there's still a possibility that the team is doing okay.

1247
01:37:45.52 --> 01:37:48.12
You know, they have a horrible leader because they are good, such good troops.

1248
01:37:48.12 --> 01:37:49.52
I would see that sometimes.

1249
01:37:49.52 --> 01:37:53.48
The platoon has a bad leader, but there's great guys in there.

1250
01:37:53.48 --> 01:37:56.04
And the platoon leader is smart enough just to be like, okay, I'm going to let them kind

1251
01:37:56.04 --> 01:37:57.04
of run with it.

1252
01:37:57.04 --> 01:37:59.04
They'll be successful.

1253
01:37:59.04 --> 01:38:00.04
Yeah.

1254
01:38:00.04 --> 01:38:06.16
So my goal, usually, is to help the person above me and the chate, well, it's always

1255
01:38:06.16 --> 01:38:08.36
to help the person above me and chate, come on.

1256
01:38:08.36 --> 01:38:12.72
Can you get to a situation where someone is so bad that it's negatively affecting the

1257
01:38:12.72 --> 01:38:16.28
whole team and you can't win because they're positioned?

1258
01:38:16.28 --> 01:38:19.64
Yes, well, then you need to step up and do something about it and say something about

1259
01:38:19.64 --> 01:38:20.64
it.

1260
01:38:20.64 --> 01:38:23.56
Do it tactfully, do it slowly.

1261
01:38:23.56 --> 01:38:28.36
Don't overcommit to your statements early on, because if you do, you might say something

1262
01:38:28.36 --> 01:38:31.40
that is out of line.

1263
01:38:31.40 --> 01:38:34.48
So that's, it's a tricky situation.

1264
01:38:34.48 --> 01:38:36.44
There's no definitive answer.

1265
01:38:36.44 --> 01:38:39.16
You have to weigh these things out.

1266
01:38:39.16 --> 01:38:43.16
Generally, if you can help someone win, you're going to win.

1267
01:38:43.16 --> 01:38:45.80
Generally, if you help someone win, you're going to win.

1268
01:38:45.80 --> 01:38:51.56
If it's so bad that they're just bringing down the whole team and you cannot win with them

1269
01:38:51.56 --> 01:38:54.60
in that position, you might need to say something.

1270
01:38:54.60 --> 01:38:57.76
Yeah, especially if everyone on the team kind of feels the same way.

1271
01:38:57.76 --> 01:39:01.84
It's going to be a little bit easier to be like, hey, you know, and be straight.

1272
01:39:01.84 --> 01:39:07.76
But even if everyone, if we have the gang mentality, like, hey, man, the boss sucks, you

1273
01:39:07.76 --> 01:39:08.76
know what?

1274
01:39:08.76 --> 01:39:10.44
He's team leaders horrible.

1275
01:39:10.44 --> 01:39:11.84
He doesn't know what he's doing.

1276
01:39:11.84 --> 01:39:13.08
Hey, guys, you know what?

1277
01:39:13.08 --> 01:39:17.08
We can sit here and complain about it or we could actually try and make him a better leader.

1278
01:39:17.08 --> 01:39:18.08
Yeah, yeah.

1279
01:39:18.08 --> 01:39:19.76
What do you guys say at think of that?

1280
01:39:19.76 --> 01:39:23.08
And then, because hey, we could try and get a replacement form, but at least he listens

1281
01:39:23.08 --> 01:39:24.08
to us right now.

1282
01:39:24.08 --> 01:39:25.08
Yeah.

1283
01:39:25.08 --> 01:39:26.08
Or whatever.

1284
01:39:26.08 --> 01:39:27.08
You know, at least he, at least he understands the job.

1285
01:39:27.08 --> 01:39:29.48
Hey, let's try and, let's try and prop him up.

1286
01:39:29.48 --> 01:39:32.68
Let's try and get, we know what, let's get rid of him, but let's get rid of him by teaching

1287
01:39:32.68 --> 01:39:33.68
him a lot.

1288
01:39:33.68 --> 01:39:36.48
So he gets educated so he can move on to get promoted and then we'll have a good relationship

1289
01:39:36.48 --> 01:39:37.48
with him.

1290
01:39:37.48 --> 01:39:38.48
Yeah.

1291
01:39:38.48 --> 01:39:40.80
And then the team will get more support and then we can do our mission better.

1292
01:39:40.80 --> 01:39:41.80
Yeah.

1293
01:39:41.80 --> 01:39:42.80
Yeah.

1294
01:39:42.80 --> 01:39:46.40
I guess he kind of doesn't understand what makes them a quote unquote horrible for sure.

1295
01:39:46.40 --> 01:39:47.40
For sure.

1296
01:39:47.40 --> 01:39:48.40
For sure.

1297
01:39:48.40 --> 01:39:49.40
Like, what if I don't like him?

1298
01:39:49.40 --> 01:39:50.40
Cause I don't like his tie.

1299
01:39:50.40 --> 01:39:51.40
I don't know.

1300
01:39:51.40 --> 01:39:52.40
I don't like his hair do.

1301
01:39:52.40 --> 01:39:53.40
You know, I just don't like him.

1302
01:39:53.40 --> 01:39:54.40
We don't, we don't come from the same side of the tracks.

1303
01:39:54.40 --> 01:39:55.40
I don't know.

1304
01:39:55.40 --> 01:40:00.80
I mean, one of the things that would be like if the guy's arrogant, the guy's arrogant,

1305
01:40:00.80 --> 01:40:02.72
well, how are we going to bring him down?

1306
01:40:02.72 --> 01:40:06.68
How are we going to bring, well, how are we not not bring him down like bring him down

1307
01:40:06.68 --> 01:40:09.72
from his job, but how are we going to bring down his ego?

1308
01:40:09.72 --> 01:40:11.72
How are we going to mellow him out?

1309
01:40:11.72 --> 01:40:14.64
And that could be a long project.

1310
01:40:14.64 --> 01:40:16.40
That could be a long project.

1311
01:40:16.40 --> 01:40:17.40
Yeah.

1312
01:40:17.40 --> 01:40:22.04
So it's like, you say, is it damaging the performance kind of thing?

1313
01:40:22.04 --> 01:40:23.04
Yes.

1314
01:40:23.04 --> 01:40:24.04
That's the most important thing.

1315
01:40:24.04 --> 01:40:25.92
Is that what is our performance like?

1316
01:40:25.92 --> 01:40:26.92
Yeah.

1317
01:40:26.92 --> 01:40:29.92
Can we bring this guy around?

1318
01:40:29.92 --> 01:40:30.92
Good question.

1319
01:40:30.92 --> 01:40:31.92
I'm sorry.

1320
01:40:31.92 --> 01:40:39.12
There's no definitive answer, but at the same time, there's leadership is an art.

1321
01:40:39.12 --> 01:40:40.36
Yeah.

1322
01:40:40.36 --> 01:40:42.80
And why did the, it's an art and science?

1323
01:40:42.80 --> 01:40:43.80
But it's an art.

1324
01:40:43.80 --> 01:40:44.80
Sure.

1325
01:40:44.80 --> 01:40:46.96
This is a case where the artistic part is going to be more important.

1326
01:40:46.96 --> 01:40:47.96
Yeah.

1327
01:40:47.96 --> 01:40:48.96
Yeah.

1328
01:40:48.96 --> 01:40:49.96
The dichotomy.

1329
01:40:49.96 --> 01:40:50.96
Art and science.

1330
01:40:50.96 --> 01:40:53.96
And what I'm blood sport, how we called martial arts, martial science.

1331
01:40:53.96 --> 01:40:57.60
The guy I was in, since it's a tenaka.

1332
01:40:57.60 --> 01:40:58.60
All right.

1333
01:40:58.60 --> 01:40:59.60
Come on, bro.

1334
01:40:59.60 --> 01:41:00.60
Bloods worked.

1335
01:41:00.60 --> 01:41:01.60
Fendam.

1336
01:41:01.60 --> 01:41:02.60
Yeah.

1337
01:41:02.60 --> 01:41:03.60
No, I know what the movie is.

1338
01:41:03.60 --> 01:41:04.60
Yeah.

1339
01:41:04.60 --> 01:41:05.60
He called it martial arts.

1340
01:41:05.60 --> 01:41:06.60
I'm sorry.

1341
01:41:06.60 --> 01:41:07.60
I'm familiar with that.

1342
01:41:07.60 --> 01:41:08.60
Two, two, three.

1343
01:41:08.60 --> 01:41:09.40
Even as a kid, I thought those movies were really cheesy.

1344
01:41:09.40 --> 01:41:10.40
Yeah.

1345
01:41:10.40 --> 01:41:11.40
Can you see?

1346
01:41:11.40 --> 01:41:12.80
Like, I saw a lot of MMA.

1347
01:41:12.80 --> 01:41:17.64
Well, I guess from my age, MMA, gosh, you know, I was in the blood sport.

1348
01:41:17.64 --> 01:41:18.64
Yeah.

1349
01:41:18.64 --> 01:41:22.04
Even when I was a kid, I wasn't thinking blood sport was legit.

1350
01:41:22.04 --> 01:41:23.04
I don't know why.

1351
01:41:23.04 --> 01:41:24.04
I thought it was.

1352
01:41:24.04 --> 01:41:26.04
None of the parts were getting.

1353
01:41:26.04 --> 01:41:28.68
I thought Rocky, I thought Rocky was more legit.

1354
01:41:28.68 --> 01:41:29.68
Yeah, yeah.

1355
01:41:29.68 --> 01:41:30.68
Okay.

1356
01:41:30.68 --> 01:41:35.12
I thought I thought that Rocky was more legit than blood sport for me.

1357
01:41:35.12 --> 01:41:37.28
Bloods sport seemed fake.

1358
01:41:37.28 --> 01:41:38.28
Yeah.

1359
01:41:38.28 --> 01:41:39.28
Yeah, I guess.

1360
01:41:39.28 --> 01:41:40.28
Right.

1361
01:41:40.28 --> 01:41:41.68
It just seemed extreme, I guess.

1362
01:41:41.68 --> 01:41:45.32
Because plus, I think with bloods sport, the rumors circulated, the tech I was

1363
01:41:45.32 --> 01:41:46.32
real.

1364
01:41:46.32 --> 01:41:47.32
That was real.

1365
01:41:47.32 --> 01:41:48.32
You know?

1366
01:41:48.32 --> 01:41:49.32
You're like, oh, you're sure it's a movie cool.

1367
01:41:49.32 --> 01:41:51.32
Made fun, but it was real, you know.

1368
01:41:51.32 --> 01:41:52.32
Yeah.

1369
01:41:52.32 --> 01:41:53.32
I, I, I, yeah.

1370
01:41:53.32 --> 01:41:58.88
Again, I, I wouldn't say I hated bloods sport, but like I haven't seen it enough to know

1371
01:41:58.88 --> 01:42:01.56
that the guy referred to martial arts as martial science.

1372
01:42:01.56 --> 01:42:06.12
That was early, early in the movie when the Vendam's teacher.

1373
01:42:06.12 --> 01:42:07.96
You know what's your typical movie, right?

1374
01:42:07.96 --> 01:42:10.36
There's a, there's a guy.

1375
01:42:10.36 --> 01:42:12.16
He's getting beat down or whatever.

1376
01:42:12.16 --> 01:42:14.20
He goes through his training process.

1377
01:42:14.20 --> 01:42:15.80
There's a, there's a montage.

1378
01:42:15.80 --> 01:42:16.80
Yeah.

1379
01:42:16.80 --> 01:42:19.84
Like in a, like in a team of, team of America, world police.

1380
01:42:19.84 --> 01:42:23.52
There's a montage training montage and then he comes back and wins.

1381
01:42:23.52 --> 01:42:25.76
There's, there's like most of your fight movies.

1382
01:42:25.76 --> 01:42:26.76
Yeah.

1383
01:42:26.76 --> 01:42:27.76
You know?

1384
01:42:27.76 --> 01:42:28.76
The montage.

1385
01:42:28.76 --> 01:42:29.76
Yeah.

1386
01:42:29.76 --> 01:42:30.76
He gets beat down early.

1387
01:42:30.76 --> 01:42:31.76
You know, he trains.

1388
01:42:31.76 --> 01:42:32.76
He becomes awesome.

1389
01:42:32.76 --> 01:42:35.16
But then there's the art enemy who's trained to, but still a bully.

1390
01:42:35.16 --> 01:42:36.40
And he has to beat him.

1391
01:42:36.40 --> 01:42:37.60
Same thing with credit kid.

1392
01:42:37.60 --> 01:42:39.16
But you're leaving out the montage part.

1393
01:42:39.16 --> 01:42:40.16
Yeah.

1394
01:42:40.16 --> 01:42:42.40
The training montage, which is very important.

1395
01:42:42.40 --> 01:42:43.40
You're the best.

1396
01:42:43.40 --> 01:42:45.76
Or, no, that's credit kid.

1397
01:42:45.76 --> 01:42:48.16
You've ever seen the movie never back down.

1398
01:42:48.16 --> 01:42:49.16
No.

1399
01:42:49.16 --> 01:42:50.64
So you wouldn't, you'll never watch this movie.

1400
01:42:50.64 --> 01:42:53.48
It's, it's, it's MMA, right?

1401
01:42:53.48 --> 01:42:54.48
It's MMA.

1402
01:42:54.48 --> 01:42:55.48
It's MMA.

1403
01:42:55.48 --> 01:42:56.48
It's, it's MMA.

1404
01:42:56.48 --> 01:42:57.48
Yeah.

1405
01:42:57.48 --> 01:42:58.48
But it's just basically credit kid.

1406
01:42:58.48 --> 01:43:03.18
It's literally like, credit kid, but just MMA now, and a little bit more cheesy.

1407
01:43:03.18 --> 01:43:04.18
Maybe a lot more cheesy.

1408
01:43:04.18 --> 01:43:05.18
I thought it was good though.

1409
01:43:05.18 --> 01:43:06.18
I enjoyed it.

1410
01:43:06.18 --> 01:43:07.18
I watched it more.

1411
01:43:07.18 --> 01:43:09.52
I was able to learn from like a master, GJ2 guy or something.

1412
01:43:09.52 --> 01:43:12.68
Yeah, Brazilian guy who, he is played by an African guy.

1413
01:43:12.68 --> 01:43:14.96
The guy on, you know, remember, gladiator.

1414
01:43:14.96 --> 01:43:15.92
You know, gladiator, right?

1415
01:43:15.92 --> 01:43:16.92
Russell Crowe.

1416
01:43:16.92 --> 01:43:17.92
Yeah.

1417
01:43:17.92 --> 01:43:18.92
And the black guy.

1418
01:43:18.92 --> 01:43:21.36
Yeah, he, you know, the one.

1419
01:43:21.36 --> 01:43:22.36
Yeah, his main friend.

1420
01:43:22.36 --> 01:43:24.36
He's the guy, but he's Brazilian guy.

1421
01:43:24.36 --> 01:43:25.36
Oh, okay.

1422
01:43:25.36 --> 01:43:26.96
It doesn't match because he's on the Brazilian accent.

1423
01:43:26.96 --> 01:43:29.36
I was gonna say, how's his portrait Gj Sachsen?

1424
01:43:29.36 --> 01:43:30.36
No.

1425
01:43:30.36 --> 01:43:31.36
It's still African.

1426
01:43:31.36 --> 01:43:36.84
But, nonetheless, you know, on paper it might seem cool, but it came up kind of cheesy.

1427
01:43:36.84 --> 01:43:37.84
I liked it though.

1428
01:43:37.84 --> 01:43:41.28
You know, they're over emphasize like all the things like he goes to the party and

1429
01:43:41.28 --> 01:43:43.000
the party's just crazy anyway.

1430
01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:45.000
Yeah, look into it.

1431
01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:48.52
Nonetheless, yes, science and art, I dig it.

1432
01:43:48.52 --> 01:43:52.28
You kind of have to, I mean, back in the question, yeah, I have to kind of wonder why

1433
01:43:52.28 --> 01:43:54.40
the boss is asking your opinion, too.

1434
01:43:54.40 --> 01:43:56.08
Is it just a general probe?

1435
01:43:56.08 --> 01:43:57.08
Like, hey, how you guys doing?

1436
01:43:57.08 --> 01:43:58.08
How's the boss doing?

1437
01:43:58.08 --> 01:43:59.08
Kind of like that?

1438
01:43:59.08 --> 01:44:03.80
Or is it, we have some concerns about your team leader, what up, you know, kind of

1439
01:44:03.80 --> 01:44:04.80
think.

1440
01:44:04.80 --> 01:44:08.64
Yeah, and even that, you got to be careful because they could lead you down that path.

1441
01:44:08.64 --> 01:44:09.64
Trump.

1442
01:44:09.64 --> 01:44:10.64
Maybe they're probing you.

1443
01:44:10.64 --> 01:44:12.84
Maybe, yeah, maybe the team leader said, hey, you know what?

1444
01:44:12.84 --> 01:44:13.84
I don't trust this guy.

1445
01:44:13.84 --> 01:44:16.000
Yeah, you see what he says about me, right?

1446
01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:18.20
And then you go in and you go, hey, you're, first,

1447
01:44:18.20 --> 01:44:20.12
bad things about this guy, what do you think of them?

1448
01:44:20.12 --> 01:44:21.56
Yeah, you tell you what you're right.

1449
01:44:21.56 --> 01:44:22.76
Now guys, it's dirt.

1450
01:44:22.76 --> 01:44:24.76
Yeah, it's dirt with ears.

1451
01:44:24.76 --> 01:44:28.88
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1452
01:44:28.88 --> 01:44:29.88
You guys, you just, yeah.

1453
01:44:29.88 --> 01:44:31.60
Yeah, a lot of team guys say dirt.

1454
01:44:31.60 --> 01:44:32.60
Yeah, yeah.

1455
01:44:32.60 --> 01:44:35.08
I think I think it came from Buds at some point.

1456
01:44:35.08 --> 01:44:39.08
Yes, it was, you'd get called turds quite a bit.

1457
01:44:39.08 --> 01:44:45.08
And then a person that was kind of maybe just not a very good individual would

1458
01:44:45.08 --> 01:44:49.84
be a turd years.

1459
01:44:49.84 --> 01:44:50.84
Never heard that one.

1460
01:44:50.84 --> 01:44:52.48
In Hawaii, they say, do do boy.

1461
01:44:52.48 --> 01:44:53.48
Same thing.

1462
01:44:53.48 --> 01:44:54.48
Do do boy?

1463
01:44:54.48 --> 01:44:55.48
Do do boy.

1464
01:44:55.48 --> 01:44:58.72
But obviously not in any kind of discipline setting.

1465
01:44:58.72 --> 01:45:01.16
We're here one more question.

1466
01:45:01.16 --> 01:45:03.20
Yes, next question.

1467
01:45:03.20 --> 01:45:04.20
Last question.

1468
01:45:04.20 --> 01:45:05.20
Jockel.

1469
01:45:05.20 --> 01:45:09.16
I've been disciplined, working hard, and staying focused.

1470
01:45:09.16 --> 01:45:16.16
But I've hit a run of bad luck, and I can't seem to get a break.

1471
01:45:16.16 --> 01:45:24.28
Well, first of all, you are lucky.

1472
01:45:24.28 --> 01:45:31.08
Because if you're capable of working hard, then that's a blessing.

1473
01:45:31.08 --> 01:45:33.72
That's luck.

1474
01:45:33.72 --> 01:45:40.48
Because there's people all over the world that don't have the ability for any number of

1475
01:45:40.48 --> 01:45:45.24
reasons, many of those reasons being just bad luck.

1476
01:45:45.24 --> 01:45:46.80
But they can't work.

1477
01:45:46.80 --> 01:45:53.80
So right out of the gate, you're lucky that you can get up tomorrow and you can go to work.

1478
01:45:53.80 --> 01:45:59.12
Now, you say you can't get a break.

1479
01:45:59.12 --> 01:46:07.40
And maybe you're getting unlucky with your career or your personal life or your business.

1480
01:46:07.40 --> 01:46:12.84
So what are you going to do?

1481
01:46:12.84 --> 01:46:15.68
Are you going to give up?

1482
01:46:15.68 --> 01:46:17.36
Are you going to surrender?

1483
01:46:17.36 --> 01:46:22.72
Are you going to assume that because you didn't catch a break today, there's no way you'll

1484
01:46:22.72 --> 01:46:29.28
catch one tomorrow or next week or next year?

1485
01:46:29.28 --> 01:46:35.60
Are you going to leave it all the chance?

1486
01:46:35.60 --> 01:46:43.08
Or are you going to do everything in your power to force luck your way to create opportunity

1487
01:46:43.08 --> 01:46:50.80
to shift the hands of fate?

1488
01:46:50.80 --> 01:46:58.20
And even then, if the break never comes, even if you roll across the finish line of life

1489
01:46:58.20 --> 01:47:10.52
bruised and plundered and empty handed from the fight, at least you know that you went

1490
01:47:10.52 --> 01:47:16.000
after it as hard as you could.

1491
01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:23.52
Thank you, gave life everything you had.

1492
01:47:23.52 --> 01:47:30.32
And you know in the end, you might still be unlucky.

1493
01:47:30.32 --> 01:47:39.16
That could happen, but I would much rather be an unlucky soul that fought until the

1494
01:47:39.16 --> 01:47:50.44
end and died with my sword in my hand than an unlucky soul that submitted.

1495
01:47:50.44 --> 01:47:57.88
Boutdown, gave up and surrendered.

1496
01:47:57.88 --> 01:48:06.64
So stop waiting to get lucky, stop waiting for a big break instead.

1497
01:48:06.64 --> 01:48:08.64
Be thankful.

1498
01:48:08.64 --> 01:48:28.32
For what you do have and go out there and fight and battle and brawl to make your own luck.

1499
01:48:28.32 --> 01:48:36.32
And I think that's all I've got for tonight.

1500
01:48:36.32 --> 01:48:48.04
So echo, speaking of fighting hard, is there anything you know about that can help us

1501
01:48:48.04 --> 01:48:49.04
stay in the fight?

1502
01:48:49.04 --> 01:48:51.08
Stand up like continue fighting hard.

1503
01:48:51.08 --> 01:48:52.08
Check.

1504
01:48:52.08 --> 01:48:53.08
Sure.

1505
01:48:53.08 --> 01:48:58.92
First thing you need to do is take care of your body habitus.

1506
01:48:58.92 --> 01:49:07.64
You use that word wrong, but body habitus is like your habitat.

1507
01:49:07.64 --> 01:49:10.84
Take care of your body is what I meant.

1508
01:49:10.84 --> 01:49:13.84
Including but not limited to your joints.

1509
01:49:13.84 --> 01:49:18.32
A lot more important than I thought from the beginning or in the beginning.

1510
01:49:18.32 --> 01:49:22.28
So how you do that is super cruel oil, jocco as super cruel oil.

1511
01:49:22.28 --> 01:49:24.64
Jocco as cruel oil called super cruel oil.

1512
01:49:24.64 --> 01:49:27.36
Another supplement called joint warfare.

1513
01:49:27.36 --> 01:49:29.04
These are good for your joints.

1514
01:49:29.04 --> 01:49:30.20
Don't neglect them.

1515
01:49:30.20 --> 01:49:31.20
That's how you stand in the fight.

1516
01:49:31.20 --> 01:49:32.20
Straight out.

1517
01:49:32.20 --> 01:49:35.08
Get them at originmain.com.

1518
01:49:35.08 --> 01:49:43.72
Also you want to increase your capacity and capability in the fight physically mentally

1519
01:49:43.72 --> 01:49:47.60
you take new product called discipline.

1520
01:49:47.60 --> 01:49:50.12
It's called discipline.

1521
01:49:50.12 --> 01:49:52.20
It's not discipline itself.

1522
01:49:52.20 --> 01:49:53.20
It's called discipline.

1523
01:49:53.20 --> 01:49:57.44
It's cognitive and physical enhancer.

1524
01:49:57.44 --> 01:49:59.88
Force multiplier.

1525
01:49:59.88 --> 01:50:01.72
Mental plus physical.

1526
01:50:01.72 --> 01:50:06.44
The sum is greater than the parts.

1527
01:50:06.44 --> 01:50:07.92
Anyway, originmain.com.

1528
01:50:07.92 --> 01:50:08.92
That's your e-gitum.

1529
01:50:08.92 --> 01:50:09.92
Really good.

1530
01:50:09.92 --> 01:50:14.32
They also have geizing rash guards there at originmain.

1531
01:50:14.32 --> 01:50:15.52
They are all made in America.

1532
01:50:15.52 --> 01:50:16.92
I don't know if you know this.

1533
01:50:16.92 --> 01:50:18.76
It's a big deal.

1534
01:50:18.76 --> 01:50:20.16
He does good work over there.

1535
01:50:20.16 --> 01:50:22.16
From the dirt to the shirt.

1536
01:50:22.16 --> 01:50:25.16
The cotton is even grow in America.

1537
01:50:25.16 --> 01:50:27.16
That's very important.

1538
01:50:27.16 --> 01:50:29.16
See what I did there.

1539
01:50:29.16 --> 01:50:30.88
Geese rash guards.

1540
01:50:30.88 --> 01:50:32.32
Compression gear.

1541
01:50:32.32 --> 01:50:33.32
Pants.

1542
01:50:33.32 --> 01:50:34.32
Compression pants.

1543
01:50:34.32 --> 01:50:35.32
Spats.

1544
01:50:35.32 --> 01:50:36.32
All there.

1545
01:50:36.32 --> 01:50:41.32
Also, or just speaking of origin, we have an immersion camp.

1546
01:50:41.32 --> 01:50:43.76
Jiu Jitsu immersion camp.

1547
01:50:43.76 --> 01:50:47.04
All levels of Jiu Jitsu are welcome to this, by the way.

1548
01:50:47.04 --> 01:50:48.04
Rubble kids.

1549
01:50:48.04 --> 01:50:49.04
Kids welcome to that one.

1550
01:50:49.04 --> 01:50:50.04
I don't think so.

1551
01:50:50.04 --> 01:50:52.12
Yeah, because something they have the capacity for kids there.

1552
01:50:52.12 --> 01:50:53.12
Yeah.

1553
01:50:53.12 --> 01:50:54.12
Yeah.

1554
01:50:54.12 --> 01:50:56.12
You should be asking me that.

1555
01:50:56.12 --> 01:50:57.12
Interesting.

1556
01:50:57.12 --> 01:50:59.12
Nonetheless, all levels.

1557
01:50:59.12 --> 01:51:01.12
Even if you don't have any Jiu Jitsu at all.

1558
01:51:01.12 --> 01:51:06.12
In fact, last time there was a group who didn't have, well, I think it was like, some

1559
01:51:06.12 --> 01:51:07.12
didn't have any Jiu Jitsu.

1560
01:51:07.12 --> 01:51:08.12
Yeah, no Jiu Jitsu.

1561
01:51:08.12 --> 01:51:11.32
And it just came when I said, like, you know, like some of the stuff you learn.

1562
01:51:11.32 --> 01:51:13.96
If you don't have any Jiu Jitsu, it's like, okay, that's not going to fit into my knowledge

1563
01:51:13.96 --> 01:51:14.96
because you have no knowledge.

1564
01:51:14.96 --> 01:51:17.40
So it's like, I don't understand this quite yet.

1565
01:51:17.40 --> 01:51:20.40
We did the fundamentals class form.

1566
01:51:20.40 --> 01:51:21.40
Yeah.

1567
01:51:21.40 --> 01:51:22.40
Yeah.

1568
01:51:22.40 --> 01:51:28.76
And even during, like, while it was going on, I had a group on the site of like a good,

1569
01:51:28.76 --> 01:51:29.76
like, 12 people.

1570
01:51:29.76 --> 01:51:32.76
And we're just doing just the basic fundamentals.

1571
01:51:32.76 --> 01:51:33.76
No Jiu Jitsu.

1572
01:51:33.76 --> 01:51:34.76
No Jiu Jitsu.

1573
01:51:34.76 --> 01:51:35.76
Yeah.

1574
01:51:35.76 --> 01:51:36.76
For sure, all levels.

1575
01:51:36.76 --> 01:51:38.84
And by the way, if you're a beginner, yeah, that's cool.

1576
01:51:38.84 --> 01:51:42.88
But also if you're good, you'll also get some awesome training there.

1577
01:51:42.88 --> 01:51:43.88
Yeah.

1578
01:51:43.88 --> 01:51:44.88
That's everybody.

1579
01:51:44.88 --> 01:51:45.88
Great, guys there.

1580
01:51:45.88 --> 01:51:46.88
Huge good school.

1581
01:51:46.88 --> 01:51:47.88
Yeah.

1582
01:51:47.88 --> 01:51:49.88
That's up on May.

1583
01:51:49.88 --> 01:51:50.88
Echo Lake.

1584
01:51:50.88 --> 01:51:51.88
Oh, yeah.

1585
01:51:51.88 --> 01:51:52.88
Yeah.

1586
01:51:52.88 --> 01:51:53.88
Echo Lake.

1587
01:51:53.88 --> 01:51:54.88
Echo Lake.

1588
01:51:54.88 --> 01:51:55.88
There's.

1589
01:51:55.88 --> 01:51:57.88
Echo's got his own lake.

1590
01:51:57.88 --> 01:51:58.88
Sure.

1591
01:51:58.88 --> 01:51:59.88
Echo Park.

1592
01:51:59.88 --> 01:52:00.88
Echo Lake.

1593
01:52:00.88 --> 01:52:01.88
Dang.

1594
01:52:01.88 --> 01:52:02.88
Nonetheless, yeah.

1595
01:52:02.88 --> 01:52:03.88
So yeah, OriginMain.com.

1596
01:52:03.88 --> 01:52:05.88
You can look and see all that stuff.

1597
01:52:05.88 --> 01:52:07.72
And, you know, if you want something, get something.

1598
01:52:07.72 --> 01:52:11.72
If you want to come to the emergency camp, come to the emergency camp.

1599
01:52:11.72 --> 01:52:12.72
All be there.

1600
01:52:12.72 --> 01:52:13.72
Jock are you going?

1601
01:52:13.72 --> 01:52:14.72
Yeah.

1602
01:52:14.72 --> 01:52:15.72
I am.

1603
01:52:15.72 --> 01:52:16.72
You're so mad last time.

1604
01:52:16.72 --> 01:52:17.72
You couldn't do that.

1605
01:52:17.72 --> 01:52:20.000
You rib rib was jacked.

1606
01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:21.000
That's your won't be jacked.

1607
01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:22.52
No, no, no, no, no, it's all good.

1608
01:52:22.52 --> 01:52:23.52
Right here the man.

1609
01:52:23.52 --> 01:52:24.52
Either way.

1610
01:52:24.52 --> 01:52:27.76
Also, for fitness gear, you want to vary up your workout.

1611
01:52:27.76 --> 01:52:33.40
You want to implement new movements, kettlebells.

1612
01:52:33.40 --> 01:52:34.56
Do you do kettlebells?

1613
01:52:34.56 --> 01:52:35.56
I know, jocking you do kettlebells.

1614
01:52:35.56 --> 01:52:36.56
I know that.

1615
01:52:36.56 --> 01:52:37.56
But that's the question.

1616
01:52:37.56 --> 01:52:38.92
Yeah, you do.

1617
01:52:38.92 --> 01:52:39.92
Mike Granchi.

1618
01:52:39.92 --> 01:52:40.92
Right.

1619
01:52:40.92 --> 01:52:41.92
Mike.

1620
01:52:41.92 --> 01:52:44.84
This guy, you know, he's a brown belt or black belt.

1621
01:52:44.84 --> 01:52:45.84
I forget.

1622
01:52:45.84 --> 01:52:46.84
Up in.

1623
01:52:46.84 --> 01:52:49.36
Carl's bad area.

1624
01:52:49.36 --> 01:52:50.36
You have no info long time.

1625
01:52:50.36 --> 01:52:51.68
Are you so work with a sister?

1626
01:52:51.68 --> 01:52:53.44
I don't even know if you remember that.

1627
01:52:53.44 --> 01:52:55.44
But so watching you know what you do Jeff Clark is?

1628
01:52:55.44 --> 01:52:56.44
Yeah.

1629
01:52:56.44 --> 01:52:57.88
Yeah, so he's on there.

1630
01:52:57.88 --> 01:52:58.88
He hit me up.

1631
01:52:58.88 --> 01:53:00.40
He's like, hey, I want to get into kettlebells now.

1632
01:53:00.40 --> 01:53:02.52
He's like, I'm looking at the on at once or whatever.

1633
01:53:02.52 --> 01:53:04.28
You know, asking the advice here's the thing.

1634
01:53:04.28 --> 01:53:06.40
I'm not an expert on the kettlebells.

1635
01:53:06.40 --> 01:53:07.56
But I do know this.

1636
01:53:07.56 --> 01:53:09.12
Don't get nuts with them.

1637
01:53:09.12 --> 01:53:10.96
But don't go too light either though.

1638
01:53:10.96 --> 01:53:12.36
I bought a kettlebell for my daughter.

1639
01:53:12.36 --> 01:53:13.96
She's five now.

1640
01:53:13.96 --> 01:53:14.96
So it's just, it looks cool.

1641
01:53:14.96 --> 01:53:17.000
It's like the one of the little 24 kilograms.

1642
01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:18.000
No.

1643
01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:22.76
No man, the smallest one.

1644
01:53:22.76 --> 01:53:25.80
But when I picked that up, I'm like no matter what fitness level I'm at, this isn't

1645
01:53:25.80 --> 01:53:26.80
going to do much for me.

1646
01:53:26.80 --> 01:53:27.80
So don't go too light.

1647
01:53:27.80 --> 01:53:28.80
This is what I'm saying.

1648
01:53:28.80 --> 01:53:29.80
Yeah.

1649
01:53:29.80 --> 01:53:30.80
Yeah.

1650
01:53:30.80 --> 01:53:32.84
Nonetheless, get them from on it.

1651
01:53:32.84 --> 01:53:34.48
Go on it.com slash jockels.

1652
01:53:34.48 --> 01:53:35.48
Some good stuff.

1653
01:53:35.48 --> 01:53:37.32
A lot of options there.

1654
01:53:37.32 --> 01:53:40.80
You think you're stuck in a boring, moop jockel workout.

1655
01:53:40.80 --> 01:53:42.28
Super hard, but boring.

1656
01:53:42.28 --> 01:53:44.68
You're going to fall off that wagon.

1657
01:53:44.68 --> 01:53:45.68
Maybe, I don't know.

1658
01:53:45.68 --> 01:53:47.44
They've got something to eat or but if you want to vary it up, go on it.

1659
01:53:47.44 --> 01:53:50.56
Go on slash jockel, get some good fitness gear.

1660
01:53:50.56 --> 01:53:57.96

Got them organized by episode, including Rob Jones, Journey's journal.

I'm going to put it on there for access, easy access.

1667

1674

Be you.

1675
01:54:33.16 --> 01:54:36.92
Also, subscribe to the podcast if you haven't already.

1676
01:54:36.92 --> 01:54:43.32
I tuned Stitcher Google Play Spotify.

1677
01:54:43.32 --> 01:54:44.32
Stitcher.

1678
01:54:44.32 --> 01:54:46.72
It's a adventure.

1679
01:54:46.72 --> 01:54:47.72
Everywhere.

1680
01:54:47.72 --> 01:54:50.44
Whatever you listen to podcasts on, subscribe.

1681
01:54:50.44 --> 01:54:51.44
Yeah.

1682
01:54:51.44 --> 01:54:52.44
It seems obvious.

1683
01:54:52.44 --> 01:54:56.04
Also, YouTube, if you are interested in the video version of this podcast, you want to see

1684
01:54:56.04 --> 01:54:57.84
what jockel looks like if you care.

1685
01:54:57.84 --> 01:55:01.84
You want to see what I look like if you care.

1686
01:55:01.84 --> 01:55:05.04
Which may be a little bit more of a thing because apparently I don't sound how I look.

1687
01:55:05.04 --> 01:55:06.48
I still get that by the way.

1688
01:55:06.48 --> 01:55:08.64
Yeah, no, I just talked to a guy about the other day.

1689
01:55:08.64 --> 01:55:09.64
Yeah.

1690
01:55:09.64 --> 01:55:10.64
Yes, yesterday.

1691
01:55:10.64 --> 01:55:11.64
That'll never go in.

1692
01:55:11.64 --> 01:55:12.64
No.

1693
01:55:12.64 --> 01:55:15.64
I don't want to see me.

1694
01:55:15.64 --> 01:55:17.44
Don't see me.

1695
01:55:17.44 --> 01:55:23.48
Anyway, if you are interested in that YouTube video version of this podcast, also excerpts,

1696
01:55:23.48 --> 01:55:27.28
take little chunks out of the podcast and post them so you can share them.

1697
01:55:27.28 --> 01:55:31.28
So they don't have to listen to two and a half three hours of a whole podcast to get one lesson.

1698
01:55:31.28 --> 01:55:33.28
One specific lesson.

1699
01:55:33.28 --> 01:55:34.28
That's not a YouTube channel.

1700
01:55:34.28 --> 01:55:36.28
No, no, you just made a new video.

1701
01:55:36.28 --> 01:55:37.28
A daydia.

1702
01:55:37.28 --> 01:55:38.28
Making more videos now.

1703
01:55:38.28 --> 01:55:39.28
Time is running out.

1704
01:55:39.28 --> 01:55:40.28
Time is running out.

1705
01:55:40.28 --> 01:55:41.28
That's a good idea.

1706
01:55:41.28 --> 01:55:42.28
That's a good idea.

1707
01:55:42.28 --> 01:55:46.76
So I'll choose little excerpts or whatever to be like, you know what?

1708
01:55:46.76 --> 01:55:50.52
This one to me hit harder.

1709
01:55:50.52 --> 01:55:52.88
This little message that you said.

1710
01:55:52.88 --> 01:55:55.000
And that one was because it is one of those ones.

1711
01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:58.20
Because you know how the old saying where it's like, yeah, we know we had to have a limited

1712
01:55:58.20 --> 01:56:00.20
time on this earth, but we don't act like it.

1713
01:56:00.20 --> 01:56:01.20
Yeah.

1714
01:56:01.20 --> 01:56:02.56
And that whole thing.

1715
01:56:02.56 --> 01:56:05.60
And really when you think about that, that's more true than I think most people

1716
01:56:05.60 --> 01:56:06.60
realize.

1717
01:56:06.60 --> 01:56:09.20
And that's why people go through like midlife crisis.

1718
01:56:09.20 --> 01:56:10.20
Right?

1719
01:56:10.20 --> 01:56:11.20
You know how they hit a certain age.

1720
01:56:11.20 --> 01:56:12.64
You're a person get a car of that.

1721
01:56:12.64 --> 01:56:14.12
Yeah, I got to get it back.

1722
01:56:14.12 --> 01:56:15.12
I don't know.

1723
01:56:15.12 --> 01:56:16.72
It's that scrambling situation.

1724
01:56:16.72 --> 01:56:20.44
You know, you're trying to scrambling to get more in.

1725
01:56:20.44 --> 01:56:21.56
But you know, there's going to come in time.

1726
01:56:21.56 --> 01:56:22.56
You can't do that.

1727
01:56:22.56 --> 01:56:26.20
There's a little old school footage in there in that video.

1728
01:56:26.20 --> 01:56:27.20
Yeah.

1729
01:56:27.20 --> 01:56:28.20
Two of.

1730
01:56:28.20 --> 01:56:35.36
If you want to see me when I was, I don't know, like 13 or 14.

1731
01:56:35.36 --> 01:56:36.36
Maybe.

1732
01:56:36.36 --> 01:56:37.56
Yeah, I was probably 14.

1733
01:56:37.56 --> 01:56:39.12
I'm going to guess 14.

1734
01:56:39.12 --> 01:56:40.12
Bronson's children.

1735
01:56:40.12 --> 01:56:41.12
Bronson's children.

1736
01:56:41.12 --> 01:56:42.12
Bronson's children.

1737
01:56:42.12 --> 01:56:43.12
That was straight up it.

1738
01:56:43.12 --> 01:56:44.12
You went through phases, right?

1739
01:56:44.12 --> 01:56:45.12
Yeah.

1740
01:56:45.12 --> 01:56:46.12
You did some great.

1741
01:56:46.12 --> 01:56:50.12
It was hard to identify fully.

1742
01:56:50.12 --> 01:56:52.96
The actual, because we had a bunch of different names.

1743
01:56:52.96 --> 01:56:58.12
One of the names of the band was rage of discipline.

1744
01:56:58.12 --> 01:56:59.12
rage of discipline.

1745
01:56:59.12 --> 01:57:00.12
Age of discipline.

1746
01:57:00.12 --> 01:57:01.12
It would never disciples of discipline.

1747
01:57:01.12 --> 01:57:02.12
No.

1748
01:57:02.12 --> 01:57:03.12
That's something else.

1749
01:57:03.12 --> 01:57:04.12
Okay.

1750
01:57:04.12 --> 01:57:05.12
A very simple discipline.

1751
01:57:05.12 --> 01:57:06.12
It was rage of discipline.

1752
01:57:06.12 --> 01:57:09.12
And it was struggle.

1753
01:57:09.12 --> 01:57:13.88
It was lock and load, which is really militaristic for someone that wasn't in the military

1754
01:57:13.88 --> 01:57:15.88
to be like my band called lock and load.

1755
01:57:15.88 --> 01:57:17.88
I realized how cheesy that is now.

1756
01:57:17.88 --> 01:57:18.88
No, that's pretty dope.

1757
01:57:18.88 --> 01:57:20.36
No, I don't know.

1758
01:57:20.36 --> 01:57:24.08
But anyways, rage of discipline's real military ish.

1759
01:57:24.08 --> 01:57:25.08
See, right?

1760
01:57:25.08 --> 01:57:26.08
You were even before.

1761
01:57:26.08 --> 01:57:28.72
Yeah, that's what the guy you got.

1762
01:57:28.72 --> 01:57:30.56
The video footage from Ellison James.

1763
01:57:30.56 --> 01:57:33.20
He when he comes on the podcast, he's like, I'm going to tell people.

1764
01:57:33.20 --> 01:57:35.20
I actually just spoiler alert.

1765
01:57:35.20 --> 01:57:39.20
Because he said, I can't wait to tell everyone that you had a band called rage of discipline

1766
01:57:39.20 --> 01:57:42.20
when you were 14 years old.

1767
01:57:42.20 --> 01:57:44.20
And I was kind of laughing about that.

1768
01:57:44.20 --> 01:57:45.20
Yeah.

1769
01:57:45.20 --> 01:57:48.20
But you were in the making from the beginning.

1770
01:57:48.20 --> 01:57:49.20
Yeah.

1771
01:57:49.20 --> 01:57:50.20
Yeah, I guess you could say that.

1772
01:57:50.20 --> 01:57:56.20
But you know, also I also look back and think, well, man, I did some dumb stuff when I was a kid.

1773
01:57:56.20 --> 01:57:57.20
Yeah.

1774
01:57:57.20 --> 01:57:59.20
Well, you didn't get a handle on the discipline, too later.

1775
01:57:59.20 --> 01:58:01.20
But you know, the seed was there.

1776
01:58:01.20 --> 01:58:03.20
You know, like a little rattlesnake.

1777
01:58:03.20 --> 01:58:06.20
You know, they say they're the most dangerous because they can't control the venom.

1778
01:58:06.20 --> 01:58:08.20
They don't have the discipline.

1779
01:58:08.20 --> 01:58:09.20
Oh, but they want the discipline.

1780
01:58:09.20 --> 01:58:10.20
That's what I think.

1781
01:58:10.20 --> 01:58:12.20
That's what I was like, a little rattlesnake.

1782
01:58:12.20 --> 01:58:13.20
Yes.

1783
01:58:13.20 --> 01:58:13.20
Interesting.

1784
01:58:13.20 --> 01:58:14.20
Right.

1785
01:58:14.20 --> 01:58:16.20
Nonetheless, you can see these videos on you.

1786
01:58:16.20 --> 01:58:17.20
Well, the video is a cool video.

1787
01:58:17.20 --> 01:58:18.20
Yeah.

1788
01:58:18.20 --> 01:58:19.20
Thanks, Chuck.

1789
01:58:19.20 --> 01:58:20.20
Good job, echo Charles.

1790
01:58:20.20 --> 01:58:21.20
Thanks.

1791
01:58:21.20 --> 01:58:23.20
Trying to do more videos.

1792
01:58:23.20 --> 01:58:26.20
Also, Chuck was a store called, Jocco Store.

1793
01:58:26.20 --> 01:58:29.20
This is where you can get discipline equals freedom shirts.

1794
01:58:29.20 --> 01:58:32.20
There's no way to get discipline.

1795
01:58:32.20 --> 01:58:34.20
You know, iconic one.

1796
01:58:34.20 --> 01:58:36.20
Also, rash guards on there.

1797
01:58:36.20 --> 01:58:38.20
Women's stuff on their hoodies on there.

1798
01:58:38.20 --> 01:58:41.20
Beanie's, who's the thing, the breed,

1799
01:58:41.20 --> 01:58:43.20
Beanie's out a little bit more of a process.

1800
01:58:43.20 --> 01:58:46.20
But you know, proved and, you know, there's going to be some beanie's on there.

1801
01:58:46.20 --> 01:58:47.20
New shirt is out.

1802
01:58:47.20 --> 01:58:49.20
Just in time for summer.

1803
01:58:49.20 --> 01:58:50.20
Good job.

1804
01:58:50.20 --> 01:58:51.20
Just.

1805
01:58:51.20 --> 01:58:52.20
Even they're there.

1806
01:58:52.20 --> 01:58:55.20
They'll need them down in Australia and New Zealand.

1807
01:58:55.20 --> 01:58:56.20
Yeah.

1808
01:58:56.20 --> 01:58:57.20
For summer time down there.

1809
01:58:57.20 --> 01:58:58.20
Yeah.

1810
01:58:58.20 --> 01:58:59.20
The southern hemisphere.

1811
01:58:59.20 --> 01:59:00.20
Yeah.

1812
01:59:00.20 --> 01:59:01.20
In Hawaii.

1813
01:59:01.20 --> 01:59:03.20
New you're wearing a new shirt today.

1814
01:59:03.20 --> 01:59:04.20
It's right.

1815
01:59:04.20 --> 01:59:06.20
Is this out back to the book itself?

1816
01:59:06.20 --> 01:59:07.20
It's out.

1817
01:59:07.20 --> 01:59:08.20
It's available.

1818
01:59:08.20 --> 01:59:09.20
Things I didn't say anything.

1819
01:59:09.20 --> 01:59:10.20
I just kind of snuck it on there.

1820
01:59:10.20 --> 01:59:11.20
So some people got it.

1821
01:59:11.20 --> 01:59:12.20
So it's live.

1822
01:59:12.20 --> 01:59:13.20
It's live.

1823
01:59:13.20 --> 01:59:14.20
Been alive for a day.

1824
01:59:14.20 --> 01:59:15.20
You're up to the book.

1825
01:59:15.20 --> 01:59:16.20
Back to the book.

1826
01:59:16.20 --> 01:59:17.20
It's actually good.

1827
01:59:17.20 --> 01:59:19.20
A front of it has a book.

1828
01:59:19.20 --> 01:59:22.20
On the back has all the titles that you've reviewed.

1829
01:59:22.20 --> 01:59:23.20
Oh.

1830
01:59:23.20 --> 01:59:24.20
It's a good one.

1831
01:59:24.20 --> 01:59:25.20
Anyway, you want to see what that looks like.

1832
01:59:25.20 --> 01:59:26.20
JoccoStore.com.

1833
01:59:26.20 --> 01:59:28.20
If you want something, get something.

1834
01:59:28.20 --> 01:59:30.20
It's a good way to support.

1835
01:59:30.20 --> 01:59:32.20
Also, psychological warfare.

1836
01:59:32.20 --> 01:59:39.20
If you don't know what that is, it's an album with tracks that each track is engineered.

1837
01:59:39.20 --> 01:59:40.20
It's not music tracks.

1838
01:59:40.20 --> 01:59:41.20
JoccoTracts.

1839
01:59:41.20 --> 01:59:48.20
Engineered to help you through any moment of weakness that you may stumble upon or that might stumble upon you.

1840
01:59:48.20 --> 01:59:52.20
Actually, you shouldn't say stumble upon you because that kind of gives the ownership to like,

1841
01:59:52.20 --> 01:59:54.20
Oh, it happens to me.

1842
01:59:54.20 --> 01:59:55.20
You know what I mean?

1843
01:59:55.20 --> 01:59:57.20
If you hit weakness, you hit the weakness.

1844
01:59:57.20 --> 01:59:59.20
Like you stumbled on the weakness.

1845
01:59:59.20 --> 02:00:00.20
You can't blame the weakness.

1846
02:00:00.20 --> 02:00:01.20
You blame you.

1847
02:00:01.20 --> 02:00:02.20
You can't blame you.

1848
02:00:02.20 --> 02:00:03.20
You can't blame you.

1849
02:00:03.20 --> 02:00:07.20
So you need moment of weakness that you happen to stumble upon.

1850
02:00:07.20 --> 02:00:10.20
There's a track for that procrastination.

1851
02:00:10.20 --> 02:00:11.20
We can up early.

1852
02:00:11.20 --> 02:00:13.20
The diet stuff falling off the diet.

1853
02:00:13.20 --> 02:00:14.20
Wagon.

1854
02:00:14.20 --> 02:00:16.20
You want to eat some donuts because they're free at work.

1855
02:00:16.20 --> 02:00:18.20
It's wasteful if you don't eat them.

1856
02:00:18.20 --> 02:00:21.20
It's disrespectful to the person who bought them.

1857
02:00:21.20 --> 02:00:24.20
And you're going to eat them.

1858
02:00:24.20 --> 02:00:26.20
That's weak.

1859
02:00:26.20 --> 02:00:33.20
Stand the path and if you need a little spot psychological warfare, you can get it on iTunes.

1860
02:00:33.20 --> 02:00:39.20
Amazon Music various wherever you can purchase MP3's boom, get it from their psychological

1861
02:00:39.20 --> 02:00:40.20
or it's a good one.

1862
02:00:40.20 --> 02:00:41.20
Good way to support too.

1863
02:00:41.20 --> 02:00:42.20
By the way.

1864
02:00:42.20 --> 02:00:43.20
Good way to support.

1865
02:00:43.20 --> 02:00:49.20
Also, if you need some more support, you can get Jocca White Tea.

1866
02:00:49.20 --> 02:00:52.20
And I've got some bad news and good news.

1867
02:00:52.20 --> 02:00:53.20
Bad news.

1868
02:00:53.20 --> 02:00:56.20
They've started testing for Jocca White Tea.

1869
02:00:56.20 --> 02:01:00.20
So they started testing their worried, you know, they see guys just dominating and they're

1870
02:01:00.20 --> 02:01:02.20
thinking they're probably on Jocca White Tea.

1871
02:01:02.20 --> 02:01:04.20
The good thing that's a bad news.

1872
02:01:04.20 --> 02:01:06.20
Good news is it doesn't matter.

1873
02:01:06.20 --> 02:01:07.20
Can't test for it.

1874
02:01:07.20 --> 02:01:08.20
All natural.

1875
02:01:08.20 --> 02:01:09.20
It's all natural.

1876
02:01:09.20 --> 02:01:16.20
No one can believe that a fully natural substance can raise any human beings deadlift to

1877
02:01:16.20 --> 02:01:17.20
8,000 pound minimum.

1878
02:01:17.20 --> 02:01:18.20
But there it is.

1879
02:01:18.20 --> 02:01:19.20
It is factual.

1880
02:01:19.20 --> 02:01:20.20
Factual.

1881
02:01:20.20 --> 02:01:23.20
Books.

1882
02:01:23.20 --> 02:01:24.20
Books.

1883
02:01:24.20 --> 02:01:25.20
All right.

1884
02:01:25.20 --> 02:01:26.20
Books.

1885
02:01:26.20 --> 02:01:27.20
You can get some books.

1886
02:01:27.20 --> 02:01:28.20
Way to worry, kid.

1887
02:01:28.20 --> 02:01:30.20
This is the book for kids.

1888
02:01:30.20 --> 02:01:32.20
The book for kids.

1889
02:01:32.20 --> 02:01:33.20
See the feedback.

1890
02:01:33.20 --> 02:01:35.20
Go on.

1891
02:01:35.20 --> 02:01:36.20
Go on social media.

1892
02:01:36.20 --> 02:01:37.20
Go on Twitter.

1893
02:01:37.20 --> 02:01:38.20
Go on Facebook.

1894
02:01:38.20 --> 02:01:39.20
You boh-ha.

1895
02:01:39.20 --> 02:01:41.20
And see kids.

1896
02:01:41.20 --> 02:01:42.20
Studying.

1897
02:01:42.20 --> 02:01:44.20
See kids doing pull ups.

1898
02:01:44.20 --> 02:01:45.20
See kids doing Jiu Jitsu.

1899
02:01:45.20 --> 02:01:47.20
See kids getting after it.

1900
02:01:47.20 --> 02:01:49.20
That'll tell you right there.

1901
02:01:49.20 --> 02:01:53.20
There's so many parents who said I can't believe my kid now wants to study.

1902
02:01:53.20 --> 02:01:56.20
That's this post little pictures of kids making math flashcards.

1903
02:01:56.20 --> 02:01:57.20
Yeah.

1904
02:01:57.20 --> 02:01:58.20
That's what I'm talking about.

1905
02:01:58.20 --> 02:02:02.20
Imagine if you get your kid to do math flashcards voluntarily.

1906
02:02:02.20 --> 02:02:03.20
Boom.

1907
02:02:03.20 --> 02:02:04.20
So that's what I'm talking about.

1908
02:02:04.20 --> 02:02:10.20
And now there's way the warrior kid to marks mission in this book.

1909
02:02:10.20 --> 02:02:15.20
Uncle Jake teaches young mark and he really teaches the rest of us.

1910
02:02:15.20 --> 02:02:17.20
How to control his temper.

1911
02:02:17.20 --> 02:02:20.20
How to work hard. How to be frugal and smart with money.

1912
02:02:20.20 --> 02:02:25.20
There's a little entrepreneurial activity in the book.

1913
02:02:25.20 --> 02:02:27.20
He also learns how to take care of his gear.

1914
02:02:27.20 --> 02:02:29.20
He learns how to save his money.

1915
02:02:29.20 --> 02:02:33.20
He learns how to deal with insults and with verbal abuse.

1916
02:02:33.20 --> 02:02:36.20
And he learns to overcome his fear of failure.

1917
02:02:36.20 --> 02:02:39.20
That's a lot to learn in one book.

1918
02:02:39.20 --> 02:02:40.20
Yeah.

1919
02:02:40.20 --> 02:02:41.20
But it's there.

1920
02:02:41.20 --> 02:02:43.20
The lessons are there.

1921
02:02:43.20 --> 02:02:46.20
And it's done in a simple clear way that only Uncle Jake knows how to do.

1922
02:02:46.20 --> 02:02:50.20
And speed of entrepreneurial warrior kids don't forget about Aiden.

1923
02:02:50.20 --> 02:02:51.20
Young Aiden.

1924
02:02:51.20 --> 02:02:54.20
He's only 12 years old, but he has a business.

1925
02:02:54.20 --> 02:02:58.20
He's making soap from goat milk from goats on his farm.

1926
02:02:58.20 --> 02:03:03.20
And he's not just making any soap. He's making good soap. He's making jocos soap.

1927
02:03:03.20 --> 02:03:07.20
You can order it at Irish.

1928
02:03:07.20 --> 02:03:13.20
Irish Oaks Ranch.com and the motto, which I thought of not giving Aiden any credit for this.

1929
02:03:13.20 --> 02:03:17.20
He didn't think of this motto. I thought of the motto.

1930
02:03:17.20 --> 02:03:20.20
The motto is, stay clean.

1931
02:03:20.20 --> 02:03:24.20
So yeah, get yourself some jocos soap.

1932
02:03:24.20 --> 02:03:28.20
You can also get a book called The Discipline equals Freedom Field Manual.

1933
02:03:28.20 --> 02:03:31.20
And that's another book. The feedback is awesome.

1934
02:03:31.20 --> 02:03:33.20
The feedback is awesome.

1935
02:03:33.20 --> 02:03:35.20
People that get that book.

1936
02:03:35.20 --> 02:03:38.20
And they get on the path.

1937
02:03:38.20 --> 02:03:41.20
They get stronger, healthier, smarter, more disciplined.

1938
02:03:41.20 --> 02:03:43.20
They're getting better.

1939
02:03:43.20 --> 02:03:45.20
And they live a better life.

1940
02:03:45.20 --> 02:03:46.20
And that's awesome here.

1941
02:03:46.20 --> 02:03:55.20
So if you or someone you know needs to know how to get on the path and stay on the path path,

1942
02:03:55.20 --> 02:03:58.20
then the field manual is for them.

1943
02:03:58.20 --> 02:03:59.20
And it'll help them.

1944
02:03:59.20 --> 02:04:02.20
Do just that. And for the audio version.

1945
02:04:02.20 --> 02:04:06.20
It's not unautable because then you can't have an album with tracks.

1946
02:04:06.20 --> 02:04:14.20
The audio version is on iTunes, Amazon music, Google Play, other MP3 platforms.

1947
02:04:14.20 --> 02:04:18.20
So if you want the audio version, get that.

1948
02:04:18.20 --> 02:04:22.20
Also, obviously, there's a book called Extreme Ownership.

1949
02:04:22.20 --> 02:04:25.20
It is combat leadership.

1950
02:04:25.20 --> 02:04:31.20
These are the lessons that we learned in combat translated into leadership principles for business and life.

1951
02:04:31.20 --> 02:04:32.20
And you know what?

1952
02:04:32.20 --> 02:04:38.20
Still on the Amazon charts right now is number 17 on all Amazon charts for books,

1953
02:04:38.20 --> 02:04:40.20
ran or something like that.

1954
02:04:40.20 --> 02:04:43.20
So yeah, you got to dig that.

1955
02:04:43.20 --> 02:04:47.20
This is still selling in and also announcement.

1956
02:04:47.20 --> 02:04:49.20
Just went over a million copies sold.

1957
02:04:49.20 --> 02:04:52.20
Yeah, which is pretty legit.

1958
02:04:52.20 --> 02:04:56.20
So thanks everyone for doing that for buying some books and copies of the books.

1959
02:04:56.20 --> 02:04:58.20
And by the way, you don't sell a million copies of a books.

1960
02:04:58.20 --> 02:05:05.20
I will book on just hype and we didn't do it through paid advertising, which I don't even know if you could do it through paid advertising.

1961
02:05:05.20 --> 02:05:07.20
The book sells because the word a mouth.

1962
02:05:07.20 --> 02:05:12.20
So everyone that listens to this podcast buys the books, spreads the word, gets it for other people.

1963
02:05:12.20 --> 02:05:16.20
You're the reason that that book is selling so well, still.

1964
02:05:16.20 --> 02:05:24.20
So thank you all for spreading the word, telling people, get it for them, get it for their team,

1965
02:05:24.20 --> 02:05:29.20
up and down the chain of command, extreme ownership, pick it up,

1966
02:05:29.20 --> 02:05:32.20
furthermore, echelon front.

1967
02:05:32.20 --> 02:05:35.20
That's my leadership and management consulting company.

1968
02:05:35.20 --> 02:05:37.20
We solve problems through leadership.

1969
02:05:37.20 --> 02:05:38.20
That's what we do.

1970
02:05:38.20 --> 02:05:42.20
And that is how all problems get solved through leadership.

1971
02:05:42.20 --> 02:05:44.20
So it's me.

1972
02:05:44.20 --> 02:05:45.20
It's safe, Babin.

1973
02:05:45.20 --> 02:05:46.20
It's JP to now.

1974
02:05:46.20 --> 02:05:47.20
It's Dave Burke.

1975
02:05:47.20 --> 02:05:53.20
You can email info at echelonfront.com or you can go to the website echelonfront.

1976
02:05:53.20 --> 02:05:58.20
And of course, we are approaching the master.

1977
02:05:58.20 --> 02:06:07.20
This is the most dynamic leadership conference ever of all time.

1978
02:06:07.20 --> 02:06:09.20
Take us or selling.

1979
02:06:09.20 --> 02:06:15.20
We've already kind of expanded the floor in the location that we have in D.C.

1980
02:06:15.20 --> 02:06:20.20
As much as we can to accommodate more people, but I'm telling you, it's going to sell out.

1981
02:06:20.20 --> 02:06:23.20
We're only doing two musters this year.

1982
02:06:23.20 --> 02:06:27.20
One is in Washington, D.C., May 17th and 18th.

1983
02:06:27.20 --> 02:06:30.20
And one is in San Francisco, October 17th and 18th.

1984
02:06:30.20 --> 02:06:37.20
So come learn, hang out, get your pragmatic leadership skills.

1985
02:06:37.20 --> 02:06:40.20
And also it's important to know that there's no green room.

1986
02:06:40.20 --> 02:06:41.20
There's no backstage.

1987
02:06:41.20 --> 02:06:47.20
We'll be there hanging out answering questions, talking, eating, working out,

1988
02:06:47.20 --> 02:06:50.20
and hanging out with everyone that shows up.

1989
02:06:50.20 --> 02:06:52.20
So join us there.

1990
02:06:52.20 --> 02:06:57.20
You can register at extremownership.com and also on extremownership.com.

1991
02:06:57.20 --> 02:07:00.20
There's a document that we put together.

1992
02:07:00.20 --> 02:07:03.20
So some people, they want to come to the conference.

1993
02:07:03.20 --> 02:07:06.20
They need to run it up there, Chanda Command.

1994
02:07:06.20 --> 02:07:09.20
And they kind of say, what should I say up my Chanda Command?

1995
02:07:09.20 --> 02:07:12.20
I want my Chanda Command to pay for it, which is awesome.

1996
02:07:12.20 --> 02:07:16.20
And the Chanda Command should pay for it, because they're going to get back a much better leader

1997
02:07:16.20 --> 02:07:17.20
in their organization.

1998
02:07:17.20 --> 02:07:19.20
But we put a document on there.

1999
02:07:19.20 --> 02:07:24.20
You can click on the link, the little link.

2000
02:07:24.20 --> 02:07:26.20
I guess it's called a link.

2001
02:07:26.20 --> 02:07:29.20
It's called creating leaders at every level.

2002
02:07:29.20 --> 02:07:31.20
And that's also on extremownership.com.

2003
02:07:31.20 --> 02:07:32.20
We'll see you there.

2004
02:07:32.20 --> 02:07:33.20
We'll see you at the master.

2005
02:07:33.20 --> 02:07:44.20
And until we do see you at the master, you can find us interacting and conversing and cruising on the

2006
02:07:44.20 --> 02:07:51.20
web's on Twitter, on Instagram, and on that FUHDABOHKI.

2007
02:07:51.20 --> 02:07:53.20
ECHO.

2008
02:07:53.20 --> 02:07:55.20
Is that ECHO Charles?

2009
02:07:55.20 --> 02:08:03.20
And I am at Jockawilling in thanks to those of you out there in uniform around the world, on foreign lands

2010
02:08:03.20 --> 02:08:11.20
in the sky over our heads, and on and under the high seas, protecting us from the evil of the world.

2011
02:08:11.20 --> 02:08:16.20
Thank you.

2012
02:08:16.20 --> 02:08:19.64
And thanks to police and law enforcement, to the firefighters and paramedics, and all of you first

2013
02:08:19.64 --> 02:08:25.80
responders, thanks for taking care of us and our families when we need it most.

2014
02:08:25.80 --> 02:08:34.24
And to everyone else out there, the nurses and the doctors working all hours to heal us and

2015
02:08:34.24 --> 02:08:40.48
the teachers trying to educate our youth and the guys hanging drywall and pouring concrete

2016
02:08:40.48 --> 02:08:46.64
and roughing and plumbing and electrical, and the farmers growing crops and the factory workers

2017
02:08:46.64 --> 02:08:53.12
building products and the fishermen and the lobstermen and the long shormon and the bankers

2018
02:08:53.12 --> 02:09:02.08
and the advisors and the salespeople and the waitresses and the cooks and the dishwashers.

2019
02:09:02.08 --> 02:09:08.88
To all the men and women across the land and every job and every capacity that show up

2020
02:09:08.88 --> 02:09:13.64
every day, thanks for listening to us.

2021
02:09:13.64 --> 02:09:19.64
And thanks for doing your job and doing it well and doing it with pride.

2022
02:09:19.64 --> 02:09:27.28
And thanks for working hard to make your own luck and to make your part of the world a better

2023
02:09:27.28 --> 02:09:35.12
place by going out there and getting after it.

2024
02:09:35.12 --> 02:09:40.80
So until next time, this is Echo and Jocco out.
