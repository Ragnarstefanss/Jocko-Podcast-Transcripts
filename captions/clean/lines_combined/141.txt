00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.50 This is Jocobodcast number 141, with echo Charles and me, Jocob Willink.
00:00:06.50 --> 00:00:07.000 Good evening, Jocob Willink.
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.000 Good evening, Jocob Willink.
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000 Good evening.
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000 March 15th, 1631.
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000 Most loving and kind father and mother,
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000 my humble duty remembered unto you,
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000 trusting in God you are in good health,
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000 and I pray, remember my love unto my brother Joseph,
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000 and thank him for his kindness that I found at his hand in London.
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000 I know loving father and I do confess
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000 that I was an undutiful child unto you
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000 when I lived there with you and by you,
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000 for which I am much sorrowful and grieved for it,
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000 trusting in God that he will guide me
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000 that I will never offend you so anymore,
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000 and I trust in God that you will forgive me for it.
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000 My writing unto you is to let you understand
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000 what a country this new England is where we live.
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000 Here are a few Indians, a great part of them died this winter.
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000 It was thought it was of the plague.
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000 Here is Timber Good Store, and A. Corn's Good Store,
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000 and here is Good Store of Fish,
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000 if we had boats to go for it,
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000 and lines to serve fishing.
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000 People here are subject to diseases.
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000 For there, for here,
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000 200 odd have died of scurvy,
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000 and of the burning fever,
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000 and beside as many lie lame.
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000 All Sudbury men are dead,
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000 but three, and three women, and some children.
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000 Here is no cloth to be had to make no apparel and shoes.
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000 So I pray, Father, send me four or five yards of cloth
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000 to make some apparel, and loving Father,
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000 though I be far distant from you,
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000 yet I pray you remember me as your child,
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.000 and we do not know how long we may subsist.
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000 I pray, do not put away your shop stuff,
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000 before I think that in the end,
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000 if I live,
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000 it must be my living,
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000 for we do not know how long this plantation will stand.
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.000 God half-taking away the cheapest stud in the land,
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000 Mr. Johnson, and the lady Arabela his wife,
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000 which was the cheapest man of a state in the land,
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000 and one that would have done most good.
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000 So, Father, I pray, consider of my cause,
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000 for here will be but a very poor thing,
00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000 no being without loving Father,
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000 your help with provisions from Old England.
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000 I thought to come home in this ship,
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000 for my provisions were almost all spent,
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000 but that I humbly thank you for your great love
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000 and kindness in sending some provisions,
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000 or else I should,
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000 and mine, a bin half-famished.
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000 But now I will,
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000 if it please God, that I have my health,
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000 I will plant what corn I can.
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000 My wife remembers her humble duty unto you,
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000 and to my mother, and my love to brother Joseph,
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.000 thus I leave you to the protection of Almighty God.
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000 Watertown, New England,
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000 and that is an un-signed letter.
00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000 From, as I said, 1631, so these are settlers
00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000 coming into New England,
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000 the letters written back to Father in England,
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.000 and obviously written from a place called New England,
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000 which is where I grew up,
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000 and where I am in the woods of right now,
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000 in Franklin County, Maine,
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.000 and we have a guest today that is also a New Englander,
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000 a Gjitzu Black Belt, a business owner,
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000 and a friend of mine,
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000 by the name of Peter Roberts.
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000 He's been on the podcast before,
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000 so if you haven't listened to podcast 93 yet,
00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000 and you need to go get the backstory of how I met Peter,
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000 and how this little deal got underway,
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000 go listen to podcast 93,
00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000 and then you can come back here,
00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000 and listen to the rest of this one.
00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000 So here we go, Pete.
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000 Welcome back.
00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.000 Thanks for having me,
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000 and I'm extremely honored to be back on,
00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000 and was a little bit nervous to come back on,
00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000 but after all you're rising,
00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000 and motivating and flanking me,
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000 and after what you just read, I'm ready to go.
00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000 Yeah, we got a pretty easy compared to those guys,
00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.000 holy shit.
00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000 And it's interesting because I live in Southern California,
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000 Echo as we know is from Hawaii,
00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000 and what's the temperature variation in Hawaii?
00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.000 In Hawaii?
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.000 In Hauai, how much does the temperature vary?
00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000 One degree, just kidding.
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000 I don't know, 10. It's 20.
00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.000 We're talking 10.
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.000 We're talking 10.
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000 We're talking about 20.
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000 In the past three days,
00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000 there was a 40 degree change here in the weather in Maine.
00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000 It went from like 90 to 50.
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000 Yeah, absolutely gives you a false sense of hope.
00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000 One day actually took it.
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000 These people that settled here,
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000 clearly were some sturdy stock that came up here.
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000 You think about what they went through
00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000 and leaving the comforts of England,
00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:57.000 and what I was thinking about is it's not like these were woodsmen from England.
00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.000 Right?
00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000 They weren't hunters from England.
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.000 I'm going to share some of them more.
00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000 But they were people from England from London,
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000 and then they were all of a sudden surrounded by this.
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000 And you can't prepare for,
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000 like there's nothing you can do conditioning-wise
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000 to prepare for this.
00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000 You get here and you survive.
00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.000 And that's what they were doing.
00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.000 Well, you're talking about like,
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000 because his dad had sent him provisions.
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000 That was his insurance policy.
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000 You know, I mean, hey, here's what we can offer you.
00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000 And I never thought about on the other side of things
00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:35.000 as a parent, like who knows what they had for work or jobs or who knows if they sent them everything they had.
00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.000 And financially what they could afford to send their son to keep him alive in New England.
00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:46.000 And you've got a pretty much figure that when your kid sails across the sea in 1631,
00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000 you are never going to see them again.
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.000 Right?
00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000 And you've got to figure you're never going to see them again.
00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.000 Yeah.
00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.000 That's got to be the thought.
00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.000 All right.
00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:01.000 So welcome back, like I said, now last podcast, obviously we talked about origin, boom.
00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.000 And we talked about where it started, how it started,
00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:11.000 the trials and tribulations to say at least that you went through getting it to that point.
00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.000 But it's been a pretty, so you were on the podcast one year ago,
00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000 because we were up at this origin camp one year ago.
00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000 And now you're back on it again, but it's been a big year.
00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:26.000 Been a huge bit of, been a big year of growth for the company.
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000 How many people?
00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000 We've grown by another 30 people.
00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000 So total, we're looking at 40 people.
00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.000 Yeah.
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.000 Yeah.
00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:42.000 And I think this time last year we were, yeah, right around 12 to 15.
00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000 And you know what, is crazy.
00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000 I don't know if I told you this, this time last year, like I don't,
00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000 I don't get real stressed out.
00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:55.000 This time last year we had the immersion camp.
00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.000 Right.
00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000 We had the grand opening in the factory.
00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:08.000 We had just moved 60,000 square foot factory into our factory.
00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000 Like two or three weeks prior.
00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000 And it was still moving into.
00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.000 And there were some other things going on with business, whatever.
00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:22.000 And I don't know if I told you this one night, I left camp during the, during camp.
00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000 I don't tell me that I left camp and went home.
00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000 I was by myself and my family was still here.
00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000 And I was laying them bad.
00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000 And I couldn't, I couldn't get to sleep.
00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000 And I just felt really weird.
00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000 Like my, my body felt weird.
00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.000 And all of a sudden my heart, I felt like it was beating through my chest.
00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000 And I was like, well, what is going on?
00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000 I'm going to come to find out how things I had to attack.
00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.000 Never had it in my life.
00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000 I haven't had one sense.
00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000 And there was more going on.
00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.000 So what does that actually mean?
00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.000 I don't even know what that whole dude.
00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000 I had never, I sounds like some echo.
00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000 30, 30 years.
00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.000 You're cruising through it.
00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.000 Right.
00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000 You mean 38 years old.
00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000 And it was like, I don't know what brought it on.
00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000 I think there was a lot of, so what does that actually mean?
00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000 So it means you're, your blood, your whole structure goes up.
00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000 And scientifically, I don't know.
00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000 All I know is it was like, I think you're going to tell me hard attack.
00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.000 No, dude.
00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000 I had, and I was like, whoa, and I just, man, I know.
00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000 So how do you know what was an anxiety attack?
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.000 I told somebody what happened.
00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000 And then they said, that was an anxiety attack.
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000 I was like, okay, I'm not having one of those again.
00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000 That was because we took down two elephants instead.
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000 Do you think that's the most stress you've ever been then?
00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.000 No.
00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.000 I mean, I, again, I don't feel like it was, no.
00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000 I mean, no, not a body of clothes.
00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.000 I mean, what do you think brought it on?
00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:51.000 I think it was a little bit of the unknown of what's to come.
00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.000 Now, this is, now it just got interesting because you're sitting here complaining about the,
00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000 we're not complaining, but you're making a statement about the unknown.
00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000 Now imagine getting on board of all the wood and ship and saying,
00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000 across the country, that's, there's no pictures.
00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000 You don't know what this place looks like.
00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.000 You have expectations.
00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000 You've heard about Indians.
00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:10.000 Right.
00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000 With Tomahawk.
00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.000 Right.
00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.000 That's what you've heard about.
00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:15.000 Right.
00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:15.000 Yeah.
00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:16.000 That's got to be stressful.
00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.000 So that was sort of a point when we, when you were on last time,
00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.000 it was at sort of everything was launching at one time, new factory,
00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000 yet all this stuff going on.
00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.000 And the day after we recorded that podcast was what?
00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000 The day after I went home and slept that night,
00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000 we recorded the podcast.
00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000 Okay.
00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.000 I remember sitting in the factory that night in a friend of mine drove by late night
00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000 and we were recording and all the lights were on in the factory.
00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000 And what it was, it was just crazy.
00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000 You know, the tri-de-de- old New England church bells in the background.
00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000 It's just an awesome, awesome time.
00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:58.000 And that kind of like got me to erase that, my body only calmed down at that point
00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000 and I reset and good.
00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000 Never had it before and never had it after.
00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000 Well, I'll tell you what, it was crazy from my perspective.
00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000 Is when we were first thinking up and we were buying the building.
00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.000 Right?
00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000 And so I'm kind of, you know, hey cool, we're buying a building
00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:17.000 and we got this going on and then I get up there and I go in the building
00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000 and the building is, it's pretty big, you know?
00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000 And I'm thinking, well this is a big, pretty big building that we have.
00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000 And do we need, I'm thinking, you know, it's myself,
00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000 do we need this big of a building?
00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000 I'm thinking myself, well, do we get a little crazy with this building?
00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:40.000 And then I come back now one year later and we have two small of the building in one year.
00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000 And so instead of there being four people, five people,
00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000 stitching at a time, everyone's stitching.
00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000 And there's machines are filled.
00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.000 The shipping areas completely filled with product going out.
00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:57.000 That's a lot of, that's, that's like an exponential.
00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:01.000 How much more are you shipping a day now compared to a year ago?
00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:06.000 We are shipping probably 10 times as much right now.
00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000 And it's growing daily exponentially.
00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.000 Wow.
00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.000 You know, the thing is is like just to frame this, just to frame this, right?
00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000 It's, it's a fallout shelter.
00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000 I mean, that's what we bought was a fallout shelter.
00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000 It was built during the Cold War.
00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:22.000 This thing is reinforced.
00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000 Like when they brought that 800 amp power in,
00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000 because we had to, we had to bring three phase power in.
00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000 They had to change the transformers because we were sucking all the power from the pound.
00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.000 So they literally, and it was pretty real.
00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.000 And so I was like negotiating with the power company, central man power.
00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000 And you know, I get them up there and I tell them,
00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.000 I vision getting by out.
00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:42.000 Like because they, it's a company.
00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000 They're going to negotiate a little bit.
00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:45.000 Otherwise, we'll put up solar.
00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.000 Exactly.
00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000 So they came in.
00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000 They put all the new transformers on on the, the pole,
00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000 you know, and the ran in the building.
00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000 And then the electrical company, the electricians who were friends,
00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000 also of us and they're like,
00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000 they're like, okay, we got to bore through the concrete.
00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:08.000 And they, they barely were able to bore through that concrete.
00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000 I have a, I have a, what do you call it?
00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:11.000 A cylinder.
00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000 They took two cylinders out of the wall.
00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000 And it was like that was so hard.
00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000 Because, you know, concrete gets harder as it ages.
00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.000 But it is the towns, the factory is the towns fall out shelter.
00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:24.000 I don't know if I've told you that.
00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000 No, when you, so when you go down the stairs, it says fall out shelter.
00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000 Yeah, I have saw that, but I thought it was,
00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000 I didn't know that was the purpose of the whole build.
00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:35.000 Originally, sent, originally the power company built it.
00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:39.000 But because it was built during the cold war, it became the fall out.
00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000 We tried to get all the tax breaks to put the fall out shelter.
00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:43.000 Probably something like that.
00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.000 Probably.
00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000 So you added 40 people, how many products?
00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000 I mean, it is just as far as products.
00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000 I mean, we're adding monthly, you know,
00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000 I mean, nutritionally on the nutritional side.
00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000 And with our partnership, like in terms of the jockel products,
00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:01.000 which have, you know, been ridiculously awesome for the masses,
00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:06.000 along with some of the new stuff we're doing and jiu-jitsu and on the lifestyle and the things
00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:14.000 as we grow, the vision and we grow, and we bring our message proliferate our message to the masses.
00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:19.000 You know, we're just, we're providing people with what they want, you know?
00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:23.000 And, you know, what's funny is some of that providing them with what they want is
00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000 this kind of a neat thing.
00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000 Like, we had Charlie Breneman here, the Spanard,
00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000 used to fight in UFC Big UFC fighter,
00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.000 and he came into the factory yesterday and he walked in the back door
00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000 and he walked in 10 steps and he stopped.
00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000 And he's a pretty cerebral guy, you know?
00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000 I mean, you don't get to the top level in the UFC.
00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000 If you're not a cerebral person like that.
00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000 And he looked at me and he said, hey, he said, hey,
00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000 he said, hey, Pete, you told me there were no stupid questions
00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000 because that's what I always preface everything with.
00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:59.000 I say, no, no, shoot, he's like, why do I feel the way I feel?
00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000 And I was like, what do you mean he's like?
00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.000 Like a little bit shocked and confused.
00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:11.000 And I said, well, that's because it's natural
00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:15.000 to feel that way when you haven't seen people building products
00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000 with their hands and a factory environment.
00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:22.000 We've only heard about it through the television or books
00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000 because it all has gone away.
00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000 And our generation were about the same age.
00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000 You know, we didn't see it, you know?
00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.000 Maybe we're kids as it was just leaving.
00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:36.000 And he was just like, man, this is just incredible.
00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000 You know, just couldn't wrap his head around
00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000 and he was just wandering around that factory up and down like,
00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:45.000 holy cow, man, this is, and once you see it,
00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:46.000 you feel it.
00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:47.000 It's a physical change.
00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000 You know, it's like when you have, and this is might be accessible
00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000 when you have your first child and you see your child
00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:53.000 is like this chemical reaction.
00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:57.000 Man, when you walk into a factory where there is people
00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000 working with their hands and working together
00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000 to bring this thing to life, it's, it's bringing something
00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000 to life in a different way and another parallel.
00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:06.000 So it's awesome to see.
00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:12.000 At what point did factory get a negative connotation?
00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.000 You think I have my own theories which I'll share.
00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.000 Please do.
00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.000 Because when people go, oh factory work, they think, oh,
00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.000 that's bad.
00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:25.000 You're sitting there doing some menial task over and over again.
00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.000 That's what some people think of factory work.
00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:29.000 And I'll agree with you.
00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000 And I bet you, that is part of what Charlie was feeling
00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.000 when he walked in there, what you think of a factory
00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.000 is not what a factory is, especially in our case.
00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:38.000 Right.
00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.000 And they're portrayed negatively.
00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:45.000 But it's all education.
00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.000 And here's what happened in that letter.
00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:52.000 He said, we don't have any textiles to make a parallel
00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000 and clothing.
00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000 Or probably leather yet,
00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:00.000 to make shoes and accessories.
00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.000 Things you need for survival.
00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:08.000 So New Englanders were forced into a position.
00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:11.000 And we talked about like Hans and daylight, right?
00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000 They had their hands and they had daylight.
00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:17.000 And they had whatever they brought for livestock to be able to build
00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:18.000 their farms.
00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000 They cleared the fields by hand.
00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000 They cut the trees by hand.
00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.000 And if you've ever stumped a tree by hand,
00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000 that's an absolute nightmare.
00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000 One tree could take a full day to stump it, to pull the
00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.000 stomps and roots out of the ground, to build a field to have
00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000 the cows to raise the cattle.
00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000 Have you stumped a tree by hand?
00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:37.000 Oh, yeah.
00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000 What's that process?
00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.000 You've got to do it.
00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000 So to stump a tree by hand, you have to,
00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000 you've got to treat down.
00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000 You dig around like all the roots.
00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.000 And then you take an axe and you've got the roots as low as you can.
00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:50.000 And you pull the stump up.
00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:54.000 And the stump is massively heavy because it's the wood.
00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:57.000 And it's all the organics that have grown around it.
00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:58.000 It comes up with it.
00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.000 It's a challenge.
00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.000 You have never done that without a machine.
00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:05.000 With how to machine, which they didn't have.
00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:06.000 Yeah.
00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:10.000 You know, and so there was this necessity to live.
00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.000 And it, okay, we have to be self-sufficient.
00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.000 We can't rely on provisions from England.
00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.000 We have to become self-sufficient.
00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:22.000 So the direction and the focus of the people in,
00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:27.000 as a union was amazing when people come together for a common cause.
00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.000 We know that's an amazing thing.
00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:34.000 And as immigration happened, you know, the French, the Irish,
00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:38.000 and everything else, they all came together to build these factories
00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.000 to harness the power of New England's rivers.
00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:44.000 And they had to.
00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:48.000 And, but what happens as after had to now you have it.
00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:53.000 And over the generations, it's expected and you become complacent.
00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:56.000 And complacency is what tore us down.
00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:59.000 Because we didn't fight hard enough to keep our factors here.
00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:00.000 We just didn't.
00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.000 We didn't fight hard enough.
00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:02.000 Why?
00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:06.000 Because we're complacent, you know, everyone's making a great wage.
00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.000 And this is 150 years later.
00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:12.000 The textile mills and the spinning mills and the dihouses.
00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:17.000 And the, you know, the boot companies and the leather factories and the tanneries.
00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:22.000 And all of those things were right around here, right around this area.
00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.000 But it becomes expected.
00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.000 And it went away.
00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.000 You know, in a way, in the early 2000s, late 90s.
00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:34.000 So the timeline touches us, right?
00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:39.000 But didn't have impact as it did on some of the older folks.
00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:46.000 Did we get sold a bill a good at some point that factory, like as people were trying to move factories overseas.
00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:47.000 And they could save money.
00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:52.000 Did we get sold a bill of goods that, hey, factory work isn't what you want to be doing?
00:19:52.000 --> 00:20:01.000 Well, what I think is that through the complacency, you know, like if you look at our grandparents, for instance,
00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:05.000 which they told us the stories.
00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:09.000 Hey, I used to go to the mill when I was eight, I go to the tannery.
00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.000 I pulled tax out of the hides. That was my grandfather.
00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:16.000 His mother worked in the low spinning mills, right?
00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:20.000 So she was in low Massachusetts and she worked on the spinning mills.
00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:25.000 You know, making the, the wool yarn or the cotton yarn to weave the tax dials.
00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:30.000 She actually used to, at that, at the end of the shift, she would sweep up all the excess wool.
00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:39.000 She'd go home and she'd spin it by hand and she'd make blankets and stuff with it, which we, we have one in the family, which is pretty cool.
00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:46.000 So you hear these stories, but you heard it as through the eyes of hardship.
00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:50.000 So immediately you're thinking that this is a hard life.
00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.000 So that's how we were taught.
00:20:52.000 --> 00:21:02.000 And so the way that we were brought up more so is that you need to go to college to get an education, so you don't have the hardship.
00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:05.000 Factory work now is a totally different beast.
00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:10.000 It's not like, back then yes, eight years old, bare feet working.
00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.000 That's what happened.
00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:20.000 And, and I think that the mindset, the gritty mindset, I think what was,
00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:30.000 what was, what's trying to take place was that kind of the hard work and work ethic and grit, you know, trying to be passed down to us, our, our parents and then us.
00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:36.000 But what didn't happen was the experiential knowledge of it. So you just heard it.
00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:42.000 And you know how it is when you don't experience and experience something you really don't know.
00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:46.000 And we became complacent and then the jobs left.
00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:50.000 They've just left, you know, trade opened up and they left.
00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:54.000 I mean, big business taken away.
00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.000 And the reverberation.
00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:04.000 I don't think that right there is, you know, when people complain about the corporate, you know, corporate making decisions.
00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.000 That's what they're complaining about.
00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.000 Is that you're not, because it's true.
00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:14.000 At a corporation, you can make a decision 100% based on bottom line.
00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:22.000 And unfortunately, those aren't, they're usually, or you can be tempted to make bad strategic decisions.
00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:30.000 And even though you might win in the short term for this quarter or next quarter or this fiscal year, in the long run, what do you end up with?
00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:32.000 Exactly. What do you end up with?
00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:42.000 And I'm not going to blame it on, let's say, the owners and administrators and the folks above.
00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:46.000 Right? And I'm not going to blame it on the workers.
00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:56.000 I'm going to blame it on the detachment and to take, you know, what, what, what, what, what, what, the whole thing you do with leadership, right?
00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.000 The culture became bad.
00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:04.000 And I'm going to tell you why I believe this, our, our third loom we bought.
00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:10.000 We, after we discovered the first two, I discovered this Italian guy.
00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:12.000 His name was Mario.
00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:20.000 And I, I just started calling people trying to find like, there was this mill in Sanford, Maine, a huge mill, like a million square feet.
00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:24.000 And I heard it, I heard it shut down.
00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:30.000 And I called the town. And I was like, hey, I heard about this mill. Somebody said there might be some equipment in there.
00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:32.000 Some old equipment, blah, blah, blah.
00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:36.000 And they're like, oh, yeah, this guy, Mario owns it.
00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:40.000 Maybe you should try calling the tax assessor.
00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:44.000 I said, okay, so I called the tax assessor.
00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:52.000 And like, yeah, yeah, we, we know this person Mario, yeah, he, he shut the mill down.
00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:58.000 And we have some contact information for him, but it was very cold.
00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:02.000 And I was like, okay, so he gave me the number and I called and I left a message.
00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:08.000 And I said, hey, my name's Pete Roberts.
00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:14.000 I'm trying to bring textiles back to Maine.
00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:16.000 And I'd like to talk to you about your mill.
00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:20.000 And he called me back, and he's an old guy, and he's a Italian.
00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:26.000 And the Italians are the ones that make the really good looms for long, long, long time.
00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:30.000 You know, about a hundred years, two hundred years, whatever it was.
00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:36.000 And his family had been in weaving and in textiles for a hundred years.
00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:39.000 And he said to me, Pete, he said, let me tell you something.
00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:42.000 And his Italian accent.
00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:48.000 He said, we didn't want to shut the doors.
00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:51.000 He said, but I did.
00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:55.000 He said, I shut the doors, I locked it up, and I walked away.
00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:00.000 And every single piece of machinery is still in that mill.
00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.000 I said, what?
00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:03.000 I'm getting chills.
00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.000 I'm getting chills.
00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:09.000 Every single piece of machinery is still in that mill.
00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:13.000 He said, if you can do something about that, I'm willing to work with you.
00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:16.000 I said, open the doors for me, man.
00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:19.000 He goes, let me tell you something.
00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:24.000 When I went to the town, when they basically wanted to take advantage of me,
00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:26.000 take advantage of me on the tax base.
00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:29.000 And I still had 40 people working there.
00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:32.000 They wouldn't work with me.
00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:37.000 He said, it wasn't me that wanted to strip it away.
00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:39.000 It was a mixture.
00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:42.000 He said, yeah, I had the shut the doors, because I was forced to.
00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:44.000 They forced my hand.
00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:47.000 The people didn't want to lose their jobs, but at the same time he said,
00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:53.000 the people were basically putting pressure on him, right?
00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:55.000 Like they're looking up like, hey, you can pay us more.
00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:56.000 Hey, you can do this.
00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:57.000 Hey, you can do this.
00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:01.000 And then he said, when I went to the town, and they wouldn't help us with any of this,
00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:03.000 he goes, what am I going to do?
00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:05.000 Shut the doors and walk away.
00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:08.000 So we have a people that's complacent.
00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:14.000 We have a town that has a spec expects what they expect and is inflexible.
00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:20.000 And you put the owner in a position where he needs to react.
00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:23.000 He needs to make a decision.
00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:25.000 And his decision was shut the doors and walk away.
00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:28.000 That's what he did.
00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:30.000 You want me to tell that story about that mill?
00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:31.000 Yeah.
00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:32.000 It's dude.
00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:34.000 We get there.
00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:37.000 And he's like, call this guy, Jim.
00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:38.000 He's at the mill.
00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:41.000 He is the night watcher, whatever.
00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:44.000 He's the caretaker for the property.
00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:47.000 And I met Jim and he said, the big white beard is sold in gentlemen.
00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:52.000 And he used to make the warps that won't be fabric.
00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:57.000 And he was very protective of everything, very protective.
00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:00.000 And you know what's funny is history channel.
00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.000 They sent a crew with us for this.
00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.000 They were going to do a TV show way back.
00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:06.000 And anyways, so we have this whole film crew.
00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:08.000 And we have this author show us here sometimes.
00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:09.000 It's crazy.
00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.000 So he unlocks.
00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:13.000 So it's all overgrown grass.
00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:15.000 The windows are smashed.
00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:18.000 The bricks are basically like falling apart.
00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.000 I mean, it's just deteriorated.
00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:28.000 And he opens door and walks in in the smell of years of no heat.
00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:31.000 And the cold and the heat and the cold.
00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:35.000 Everything was peeled and all the floorboards were punky and popped up.
00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:36.000 Nail sticking up and everything.
00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:42.000 But we walked in that mill and it was exactly set up the way he left it.
00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:49.000 I'm talking huge cotton processing machines made out of wood with needles to separate
00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:51.000 to card the cotton to pull the organic out.
00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:58.000 I'm talking a I would say a football field long spinning machines to spin yarn.
00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:03.000 And then Jim after I started talking to him about what we're doing.
00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:04.000 Because he was just cold.
00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:08.000 He was just like what number, what number loom were you getting from him?
00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:09.000 That was number three.
00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:12.000 And the warp.
00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:17.000 So we he in then I saw like six looms on the floor.
00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:20.000 And I was like, you guys have a loom.
00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:23.000 See, he's like, let me show you something.
00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:26.000 And were they rusted with a broken worn or were they in okay condition?
00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:29.000 They had not been run for 20 years, I think.
00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:32.000 So they were in okay condition because they were between floors.
00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:36.000 So the top floor was just destroyed.
00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:39.000 And you know all those bins we have in the pro shop.
00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:40.000 They came from that mill.
00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:41.000 All those camispins.
00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.000 So that top floor was destroyed.
00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:46.000 There was just bird's nest and shit everywhere, right?
00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:47.000 All over everything.
00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:50.000 And then they went in the middle floors.
00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:51.000 But he's like, let me show you something.
00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:52.000 I'm like, okay.
00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:58.000 And we follow him down this staircase and I'm like, this is going to like murder us or something.
00:28:58.000 --> 00:28:59.000 I don't think.
00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:00.000 What is going on?
00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:04.000 We walk in and he pulls his flash light up like this.
00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:07.000 And it's like a layer of dragons.
00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:13.000 There's got to be 67 the looms in the basement of this place.
00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:15.000 And that's where we pulled the shit out.
00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:17.000 What does it loom cost right now?
00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:18.000 How brand new loom?
00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:23.000 If we were going to go brand new probably 120 maybe.
00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:27.000 You know, and where'd you pay for loom number three?
00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:29.000 Loom number three.
00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:31.000 I negotiated 25 hundred bucks.
00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:36.000 And we'll have you buy the rest of those.
00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:37.000 We should.
00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:39.000 Dude, it's just to move on.
00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:41.000 It's like, they're 9,000 pounds each.
00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:42.000 Yeah.
00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:43.000 They're massive.
00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:45.000 Joe Joe ran the show.
00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:46.000 There's more juggle like the other.
00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:47.000 Yeah, we did.
00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:48.000 Double close.
00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:52.000 We, I told the, so anyways, we, when you go shit deal,
00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:56.000 I spent, I was like 10 grand and we got like a few different things.
00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.000 All massive machines, the warpur with the creal.
00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:05.000 We got a loom, uh, the, in the pro shop, the, the, the backwinding machine that I refurbished.
00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:07.000 That came out of there.
00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:17.000 And the most important thing we got out of that place was the punch card machine to punch the patterns to go in the looms.
00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:18.000 That's in my office.
00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:19.000 Yeah, that's a cured.
00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:20.000 We've got to walk in my face.
00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:26.000 So that's, that's how you actually decide what, how that loom is going to weave together the material.
00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:30.000 So it looks like dragon weave looks like exactly.
00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:33.000 So that's, that's the, that's the deal.
00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:38.000 I mean, that place was, and I'm still like trying to work with Mario to get more equipment.
00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:40.000 But yeah, let's trick you.
00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:44.000 Okay, so you've been, you were kind of doing that.
00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:45.000 You've been doing that.
00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:50.000 Obviously once we met, you know, you're at 12 people, you're growing.
00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:53.000 You, you, you obviously, I gave you a copy of Extreme Ownership.
00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:57.000 You read that. How is that, is that played a role? How is that played a role?
00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.000 Because I know you've told me it's played a role.
00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:02.000 Where did you see yourself going, okay, you know what?
00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:04.000 Here's something I need to do different.
00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:11.000 And I've said this, I said this on an interview the other day that, you know, someone was talking about what kind of, what they say,
00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:14.000 background check did I do on you before we started working together?
00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:15.000 Right.
00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:17.000 And is that what there was that there was no due diligence?
00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:18.000 What kind of due diligence?
00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:22.000 And I, you know, I was explaining how we spent a lot of time talking.
00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:28.000 And via Skype and what I was really listening to and hearing was, you know, you weren't making excuses about anything.
00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:31.000 Well, you know, you explained to me, hey, we tried to do this.
00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:33.000 I didn't know what I was doing.
00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:34.000 I had to learn that.
00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:37.000 Then I tried to do this other thing and guess what?
00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:38.000 I didn't have enough capital.
00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:39.000 I had to figure out another way.
00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:42.000 You weren't saying, you didn't blame anybody else for anything.
00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:46.000 I mean, and, you know, we're, we're right now in a great point with origin.
00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:48.000 And you weren't always at a great point.
00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:51.000 I mean, you've had, you've had to do whatever you bit struggling business had to do.
00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:53.000 Or small business has to do that is struggle to grow.
00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:59.000 And when I talked to you, you, you, you already had the attitude of taking ownership of everything you could.
00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:05.000 But I know in talking to you that you've also pulled a lot of stuff out and said, oh, yeah, this is, this is had an impact.
00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:06.000 Oh, yeah.
00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:08.000 I mean, there's tons of stuff.
00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:09.000 There's tons of stuff.
00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:15.000 You know, first of all, what you jutsu has done for me is expose me.
00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:16.000 It's what it does.
00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:18.000 It exposes your weaknesses.
00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:29.000 So you get better. And that mindset that you jutsu mindset, I like being exposed because our brains have changed.
00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:30.000 Right?
00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:32.000 And I think that's what makes this work.
00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:39.000 Like if, if, if, if, if, if I, if I don't see the weakness and somebody exposes it,
00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:42.000 the first thing I do is feel like a schmock for a second,
00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:46.000 but then I'm like, okay, well, show me how I can get better.
00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:50.000 You know, when there's so many times I've like texted you late night, hey, man, can you talk?
00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:53.000 Can you help me out with this issue? Can you help me out with this problem?
00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:59.000 You know, because leadership for me has only come through playing sports and then running business.
00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:00.000 Right?
00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:01.000 I wasn't in war.
00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:09.000 I didn't see the worst of humanity and how decisions can affect someone living or dying.
00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:13.000 I didn't see that, you know, and I, it's a whole not a level, you know?
00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:24.000 And knowing that you had had and had those leadership skills that were, you know, that you conditioned to,
00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:26.000 is really what it was.
00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:28.000 You know, I just knew there was another level.
00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:34.000 And so when I actually listened to extreme ownership for the first time, you know,
00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:41.000 I was just humbled by that, you know, by the book.
00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:48.000 The two things for me that really, and of course, I went to the monster too, and I'd recommend if you're in business,
00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:52.000 any leadership position, regardless of industry.
00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:53.000 Go.
00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:56.000 Like, and it'll be the most valuable thing you do for yourself.
00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:04.000 Like, it's hard to explain, but I can tell you being there in the presence, first of all, warriors,
00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:08.000 but also their stories is powerful.
00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:15.000 You know, connecting with them on a personal level outside of the monster, that's powerful.
00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:18.000 Decentralized command change the game for us.
00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:23.000 Man, you know, I didn't think I was a control freak.
00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:29.000 I just, I was always like, you need to bring me a better idea.
00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:32.000 It's got to be better than my idea, right?
00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:34.000 I will go with anybody's idea.
00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.000 It's got to be better though.
00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:38.000 It's got to make more sense, and I'll switch.
00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:41.000 I'll shut it down and switch immediately.
00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:49.000 But you know what I found out is I wasn't giving people an opportunity to give me their idea.
00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:58.000 We had a great culture, we had a great culture, but I wasn't giving them the opportunity to be leaders.
00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:05.000 I had kind of nurtured a kind of, I will help you decide.
00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:07.000 I'll help you.
00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:10.000 You know, you come to me and I'll help you.
00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:16.000 And once I shifted that, and I actually had a lot of our managers and leaders,
00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:24.000 listen to extreme ownership, and I'll tell you what, the ones who listened,
00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:30.000 I knew they would become leaders, and the ones who gave me slack about it,
00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:33.000 I knew there's another path for them.
00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:39.000 Because you have to humble yourself to listen, and then not only listen, but apply it.
00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:44.000 So, then I've got a little off course with the decentralized command too.
00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:48.000 I've given a little too much, and you know, because I can't hear your shot of fire.
00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:50.000 Which is the whole other thing, right?
00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:58.000 But then I've had to come at me like, people make decisions, but not be the right decisions.
00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:06.000 I don't want to have to bite my tongue about it. At the same time, I've had the leadership skewed,
00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:10.000 you know, like, decentralized command can be skewed from the other side.
00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:16.000 Well, this person needs to do this, or sometimes, like, you know, sometimes you just need to make a decision.
00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:20.000 Well, you can take that, and you can say, well, I'm just going to make a decision every time.
00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:22.000 No, that's not what we're talking about here.
00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:26.000 You know, so decentralized command for us changed the game.
00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:32.000 Well, you wouldn't be able to do, you would not be able to do anything that you're doing right now.
00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:37.000 If you were trying to control everything that the way you were a year and a half, two years ago, impossible.
00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:39.000 Exactly. And the growth.
00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:47.000 And I would say that the transition between growth phases, which is a lot of transition,
00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:51.000 has been so smooth because we're all on the same page.
00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:53.000 You know, we're all on the same page.
00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:59.000 And winning it all costs, which is a big one for me, because that's where you got a completely
00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:01.000 doop your ego.
00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:04.000 We've had some conversations about that.
00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:11.000 Yeah, well, and interesting. I talked about winning it all costs at the most, or I haven't really exposed it to everyone.
00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:17.000 But, you know, the basic concept is that when we say winning it all costs,
00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:22.000 we think of that from an attitude of being completely aggressive moving forward,
00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:24.000 not ver stopping no matter what happens.
00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:26.000 I'm going to execute the plan that I came up with.
00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:28.000 And that sounds good.
00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:30.000 And it gets everyone all fired up.
00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:34.000 But the reality is, and I'm not a fact you and I were just talking about this.
00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:41.000 Somebody here at camp said, basically, is it okay to quit?
00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:46.000 I feel like I don't want to quit, but I've got something going on.
00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:54.000 Basically a guy, a great guy, hard worker, has a business, been running his business.
00:37:54.000 --> 00:38:01.000 It was his goal was to get this business up and running a very hard business, a very labor-intensive business,
00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:05.000 a very fickle business, agriculture.
00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:08.000 And he's been grinding. He was at camp last year.
00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:09.000 I talked to him all last year.
00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:14.000 I remember I asked him a lot of questions about leadership and ownership and business, and all that.
00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:20.000 He comes back this year and he came to me this morning.
00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:24.000 And really, I think this, I told him this, this conversation that we had made it,
00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:28.000 feel like it was worthwhile for me to come to camp because he said to me,
00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:34.000 I feel like, is it ever okay to quit?
00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:37.000 I know I'm not supposed to, he was in the Marine Corps.
00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:39.000 We don't quit.
00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:42.000 And I said, if you listen to all the podcast, then he goes,
00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:45.000 yeah, and I go, because I answered this question.
00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:47.000 I answered this question.
00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:50.000 The question is, is it ever okay to quit?
00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:52.000 And so you and I just had this conversation.
00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:54.000 And you said, need direct reaction.
00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:56.000 You read your, read your reactions.
00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:57.000 No, you can never quit.
00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:59.000 No, I come from the Seal teams.
00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:02.000 Where our motto is actually never quit.
00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:06.000 That's actually one of our mantras.
00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:11.000 And then I said, okay, Pete, if you came up with a plan,
00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:15.000 that was driving our business into the ground,
00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:17.000 but you were just never going to quit.
00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:18.000 Would that be good?
00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:20.000 No, you're like, no, okay, there you go.
00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:21.000 Yeah, that's a lot of it.
00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:23.000 It does more trickster.
00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:24.000 Yeah, well, trickster.
00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:26.000 I'm a little trickster.
00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:27.000 So, so that's the problem.
00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:30.000 If you have something that is, that is like that,
00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:32.000 that whether it's hey, I want you to charge,
00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:34.000 singa, nest, or whether it's,
00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:37.000 hey, I want you to continue to execute this plan,
00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:40.000 or whether it's, hey, I want you to even something like this.
00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:44.000 Hey, you should keep training hard, right?
00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:45.000 Guess what?
00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:46.000 My knees a little bit tweaked.
00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:47.000 Don't quit.
00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:48.000 Well, now you blow your knee out.
00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:49.000 Right.
00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:52.000 So, the fact of the matter is, sometimes you got to look at,
00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:56.000 so then I said, okay, what is your long term strategic goal?
00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:58.000 Like your actual strategic goal.
00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:03.000 Because his goal was, the goal of his was not to build that business.
00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:05.000 The goal of his was to be able to take care of his family
00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:08.000 and be around his family and do something with his family
00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:10.000 that he could carry on as a legacy.
00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:11.000 That was his goal.
00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:12.000 It wasn't working out.
00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:15.000 The business part of it wasn't working out.
00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:17.000 I don't know what he's going to do,
00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:20.000 but I can tell you, I saw him an hour later
00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:22.000 and he had a big smile on his face.
00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:24.000 And I said, you feel lighter, don't you?
00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:27.000 And he goes, yes, I do feel lighter.
00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:28.000 That, thank you.
00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:32.000 But the point is, not that he's necessarily going to stop,
00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:36.000 but he's going to maybe shift his direction a little bit
00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:39.000 or he's going to attack it with a different perspective.
00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:40.000 He's going to do something different.
00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:42.000 He realized, man, we talked about this in two, two all the time.
00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:43.000 Yeah.
00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:44.000 I just got done teaching the white belts.
00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:48.000 I'm like, the knee shield, you're not going to go through it.
00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:49.000 You can't go through it.
00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:50.000 You cannot go through it.
00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:52.000 It's humanly impossible.
00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:54.000 You cannot go through the knee shield.
00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:55.000 You have to go around it.
00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:56.000 You have to go under it.
00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:57.000 You have to back away from it.
00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:58.000 You've got to do something else.
00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:00.000 So if I say go through that knee shield
00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:02.000 and you just go forward forward forward
00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:03.000 and you never quit.
00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:04.000 Guess how long you're going to be there.
00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:05.000 Forever.
00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:07.000 You can't physically move your hips on your hips.
00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:08.000 Yes.
00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:10.000 So this idea of like never quitting.
00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:12.000 It's something that we have to be careful about.
00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:16.000 We have to be careful that what we're not quitting is something strategic.
00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:18.000 And we have to continually check that that strategy,
00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:22.000 that strategic goal that we're moving towards is actually something that we don't.
00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:26.000 I had this conversation with Dave several years ago about echelon front
00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:30.000 and he was like, oh, you know, we got to expand.
00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:32.000 And I said, yeah, absolutely, we got to expand.
00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:34.000 And we were talking about how we were going to do it.
00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:38.000 And we started looking at like how many gigs and how many numbers and how many things
00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:40.000 and how many events and how many companies were going to be in.
00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:42.000 And I said, let me ask you this.
00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:47.000 Why do we want to expand in that manner?
00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:52.000 Is that really what we want is to expand in that way.
00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:54.000 And we thought about it.
00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:57.000 And it's like, no, actually we want to do something a lot smarter than that.
00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:59.000 So we quit.
00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:01.000 Basically you adapted.
00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:02.000 We adapted.
00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:06.000 But we did we we adapted, but I mean to look at it in the blunt language,
00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:08.000 I like, oh, we quit this direction.
00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:09.000 But that's fine.
00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:10.000 Now, let me too.
00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:12.000 It is the we didn't quit.
00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:16.000 We didn't quit the strategic goal of growing, of spreading the word,
00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:21.000 of helping people learn, of bringing leaders up to their, their potential.
00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:22.000 That's what the goal is.
00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:25.000 The goal isn't, hey, we want to have X amount of clients.
00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:29.000 We would rather have the clients that really adopt what we say,
00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:32.000 that really absorb what we say, that we can really have an impact on.
00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:34.000 That's what we're looking to do.
00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:38.000 So yeah, those kind of things are important to consider.
00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:42.000 And I know, I know that's some of the conversations that we've had about
00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:43.000 winning at all costs.
00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:48.000 So winning at all costs means sometimes you do things that on the surface,
00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:51.000 they don't seem like winning moves.
00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:52.000 I know.
00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:54.000 You know, it's, it was crazy.
00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:57.000 My wife read an extreme ownership.
00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:00.000 She devoured it, but watch out now, boy.
00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:01.000 Oh, man.
00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:07.000 You know, and sometimes, you know, 99% of the time she applies it.
00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:12.000 But sometimes she'll say to me, I just don't feel like playing your game today.
00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:14.000 You ever heard that?
00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:16.000 Not for my wife.
00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:17.000 No.
00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:18.000 Well, I mean, I work with my wife.
00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:19.000 We have a great work.
00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:21.000 And actually, that's something that we should talk about,
00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:23.000 because you do have a great work in relationship with your wife.
00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:25.000 I hear you on the phone.
00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:31.000 And that is basically her saying, like, I don't know what she's trying to say,
00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:34.000 but I do what you do in extreme ownership.
00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:35.000 I'll do it.
00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:36.000 Yeah.
00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:40.000 With some of the toughest conversations will be like,
00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:43.000 it's six o'clock or seven o'clock,
00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:47.000 and she's still working to make sure we win it all costs.
00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:51.000 She's actually physically shipping product with the rest of the team.
00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:55.000 And she'll work to probably 10 to do that on occasion.
00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:57.000 And I'll walk out and I'll be like, how's it going?
00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:01.000 She's like good, and I'll be like, I haven't trained this week.
00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:03.000 I was thinking about going to train.
00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:06.000 And then she'll give me the look.
00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:10.000 That's not me winning at all costs.
00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:14.000 And it's kind of like one of those things you've got to balance,
00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:18.000 like, what's the most important thing here to make happen?
00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:24.000 But at the same time, when she's in the game,
00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:27.000 she'll be like, I know you need that.
00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:29.000 So I will handle this.
00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:32.000 And then it's kind of like you scratch my back.
00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:33.000 I'll scratch yours.
00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:36.000 In the military, it's called a mutually supporting relationship.
00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:37.000 Mutuality is what it's called.
00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:39.000 You're going to take care of me this time.
00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:41.000 And tomorrow, I got you.
00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:42.000 Yeah.
00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:44.000 You know, when you're all sore from you train last night,
00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:45.000 guess what?
00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:46.000 You can get in here and stay late night.
00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:47.000 Exactly.
00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:48.000 Exactly.
00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:49.000 You'll do something relaxing.
00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:50.000 Exactly.
00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:56.000 But you know, there's occasions where like winning it all costs is like,
00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:00.000 it really is sometimes you're just like thinking,
00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:03.000 oh man, I have to, I've got a freaking do this, bro.
00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:05.000 I've got to, I got it with you.
00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:08.000 It's like, I'll go in my office and I'll sit down and I'll put my hands
00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:10.000 on the desk and I'll just put my head down and close my eyes,
00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:13.000 but like reset, go.
00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:15.000 And then just go do it.
00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:17.000 Yeah, just move.
00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:19.000 I had this conversation with another camper up here.
00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:23.000 That was like, you know, I love extreme ownership,
00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:26.000 but one of my friends has had trouble with it.
00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:29.000 And I said, oh, what type of trouble?
00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:31.000 Have they had with extreme ownership?
00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:35.000 Well, they're trying, he's trying to get his team to take ownership
00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:38.000 and they're not taking ownership.
00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:41.000 And I said, okay, more, expand.
00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:44.000 And basically, it's like, oh, the team mess something up.
00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:47.000 And he's like, you guys got to take ownership with it and fix it.
00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:50.000 And in your mind, you're thinking, oh, I'm going to get them to take ownership.
00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:52.000 That's the problem.
00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:53.000 That's the problem.
00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:55.000 The real, just so everybody knows.
00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:56.000 Yeah.
00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:59.000 The real thing that you do is you say, oh, I see that you guys failed
00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:00.000 on the project.
00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:03.000 I obviously let you down.
00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:05.000 I obviously didn't give you clear enough guidance.
00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:07.000 I didn't explain it to you well enough.
00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:09.000 I didn't give you the resources that you need.
00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:11.000 I didn't, and you don't say this part,
00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:13.000 I didn't micromanage you enough.
00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:14.000 That's exactly.
00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:16.000 Because when you start saying, okay, I'm going to come in.
00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:18.000 I'm going to make sure we get that don't, hey, you know what?
00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:22.000 I only met with you three times over three weeks during that project.
00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:23.000 That's my fault.
00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:27.000 Now we're going to meet every day because I want to make sure that we're tracking.
00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:28.000 Yeah.
00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:30.000 And if you do that, you can will stuff to happen.
00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:32.000 I mean, you can make things happen through force of will.
00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:35.000 And so in that situation where you get down there, you get to meet every day.
00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:36.000 You're going to check at the end of the day.
00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:38.000 You're going to make sure that we're making progress on the project.
00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:39.000 That we're supposed to.
00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:42.000 And your team now goes, oh, damn, we don't want this.
00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:43.000 We're going to go back off.
00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:45.000 And then you know what they just did?
00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:46.000 They took ownership.
00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:47.000 Exactly.
00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:55.000 And you know what I have to be very careful of, though, is because of the fragility of human resources,
00:46:55.000 --> 00:47:01.000 which are also in our culture, it's our family too, is saying the word failure.
00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:07.000 You know, and, and I think the thing is, and where the transition happens is when you
00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:14.000 understand that in what I'm trying to get, like a man to understand is that extreme ownership
00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:16.000 is it's not a game.
00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:18.000 It's actually a way of thinking.
00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:20.000 And you really have to believe that.
00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:23.000 So when you're saying, hey, I gave you too much.
00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:26.000 I gave you, I gave you so much.
00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:28.000 There's absolutely no way you could handle that.
00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:34.000 I failed you by asking you to do that.
00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:37.000 The words coming out of your mouth, you have to believe.
00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:42.000 A lot of people will say it, but they don't believe it, and lately they don't believe it, totally.
00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:48.000 And that is, that is the ego, and that is actually getting it, and you have to take yourself,
00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:50.000 and you have to put yourself in their shoes.
00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:56.000 And if you can't detach and do that, then you are playing the game.
00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:58.000 You're playing the game, and it's not a game.
00:47:58.000 --> 00:47:59.000 It's not a game.
00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:03.000 And I've said this one before where someone says, you know, when I get in front of my team and I say,
00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:04.000 hey, guys, this was my fault.
00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:05.000 This happens.
00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:08.000 And then someone on the team goes, yeah, it was your fault.
00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:11.000 And you know, when I ask, oh, I ask groups, I'll ask companies that.
00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:12.000 I say, what do you say to that?
00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:15.000 And people get all like, they get confused.
00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:18.000 They say, well, you should tell them about what the mistakes that they made.
00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:19.000 So they can do it.
00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:23.000 And it's like, no, what you actually say is, when someone, when you say, hey, this was my fault.
00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:25.000 They say, yeah, it is your fault.
00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:27.000 And you say, I know that's what I just said.
00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:29.000 It is absolutely my fault.
00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:30.000 Here's the mistakes that I made.
00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:32.000 Here's what I'm going to do to fix them.
00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:33.000 So we do better next time.
00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:37.000 I usually just say, I won't let you down again.
00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:38.000 I'll make sure this doesn't happen.
00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:39.000 Yeah.
00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:41.000 I was down there fixing a loon the other day.
00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:42.000 Yeah.
00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:42.000 You're dead.
00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:43.000 You're about that?
00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:44.000 No.
00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:45.000 Our loon tech.
00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:47.000 You know how you asked about when we first started working together, you're like, well, proud.
00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:52.000 What if what if something happens to one of these old timers that helps you with the machinery?
00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:55.000 And I was like, we find a way.
00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:58.000 How many moving parts are on a loom?
00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:00.000 There's got to be 10,000.
00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:08.000 It looks like the most insane contraption that looks like when you look at one and you see it moving.
00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:11.000 You think yourself, there's no way that this works.
00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:14.000 There's millions of little like needles.
00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:15.000 What are they?
00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:16.000 A little hooks or something hooks.
00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:17.000 It's a little crazy.
00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:26.000 We were our so-called any our loom guy who got a set up with everything and re-ferbered everything.
00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:29.000 And what I say, we bought a loom for 2500 bucks.
00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:32.000 I mean, like, we got a frame for 2500.
00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:33.000 It's like getting a car frame.
00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:35.000 But now we're going to build a car.
00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:39.000 So, you know, it costs money to get these things back up and going.
00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:43.000 And most importantly knowledge, because we have to have all the parts machined from scratch that
00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:45.000 They don't make anymore.
00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:49.000 And then you spend 10 grand on parts that you hadn't machined and they don't work.
00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:52.000 And that's why loon number three still down.
00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:54.000 What you're saying?
00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:59.000 You know, fairly such a great story.
00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:00.000 So, those are work.
00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:05.000 Yeah, we actually, on my podcast, we just talked about if we made the right decision.
00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:07.000 You have to listen to that.
00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:12.000 Did we make the right decision or should we have gone and gotten a note in span of
00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:17.000 quarter million dollars or new looms and waited the six months for the build out to get the looms.
00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:21.000 And so anyways, letting us sick.
00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:26.000 And he's the old time or he used to work in the baits mill to weave, you know, the huge mill.
00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:27.000 He was the one.
00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:35.000 He got sick and I could tell that my team was, let's say, failing.
00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:38.000 And that was one of those times recently.
00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:42.000 That's about a month ago where I sat in my seat and I just kind of was like,
00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:44.000 This isn't working.
00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:46.000 And it's not going to work.
00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:50.000 If you don't drag your ass downstairs into the bunker.
00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:53.000 Into the fallout shelter because that's where these things are.
00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:59.000 Into the dragons layer and fix it and show them there is a way to fix it.
00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:01.000 Go hands on it.
00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:06.000 So we went down there and we started stripping things apart completely apart.
00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:09.000 And figuring it out.
00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:15.000 And after a solid seven to 10 days,
00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:21.000 we got it back up and running.
00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:25.000 And you know what that did to that team at 21 year old?
00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:27.000 Oh, I actually know what it did.
00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:28.000 Go ahead.
00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:29.000 No, you tell me.
00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:33.000 Well, people ask me all the time, what can we do to make our team tighter?
00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:37.000 And I say, if you want your team to be tighter, if you want to have better morale,
00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:40.000 do hard things together.
00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:42.000 Do hard things together.
00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:44.000 It raises everyone's confidence.
00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:46.000 It brings everyone together on the team.
00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:48.000 It makes you feel like you got over something.
00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:50.000 A lot of companies that I work with now.
00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:53.000 Our companies that survived the economic downturn.
00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:55.000 And they talk about it like they went to war.
00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:58.000 And they survived and now we're tight and we're bros and nothing's ever going to
00:51:58.000 --> 00:51:59.000 rest part.
00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:02.000 Yeah, I'm getting the chills when you just thinking about that.
00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:05.000 That recession was war on business.
00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:06.000 Yeah.
00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:10.000 The military units, what makes a military unit have morale?
00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:13.000 Well, you put them through boot camp and they go through hard things together.
00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:16.000 And then you take a special operations unit.
00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:18.000 You put them through tougher training.
00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:20.000 And it makes them even tighter.
00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:25.000 And then when you take a unit, a conventional force unit or a spec option unit,
00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:29.000 and you put them into combat, they're going to get even tighter.
00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:32.000 And the harder the combat, the tighter they get.
00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:37.000 So you and your crew spending seven days, 12 hour days,
00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:41.000 trying to figure out this significant problem and overcoming it.
00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:44.000 It brings you, it brings us tighter together.
00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:50.000 And like you're 21 year old kid that's learning how to do this.
00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:51.000 I don't know I'm calling the kid.
00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:54.000 He's a man with a job, making stuff happen.
00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:57.000 He feels, alright, I've got value.
00:52:57.000 --> 00:52:58.000 I've got confidence.
00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:01.000 I can, this machine, this machine doesn't run me.
00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:02.000 I run this machine.
00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:03.000 Exactly.
00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:05.000 And you know what was funny is when?
00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:08.000 Like there's a, people are looking at it.
00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:12.000 People are looking for like, what's the, how are we going to solve this?
00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:13.000 And I have this rule.
00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:20.000 It's, it's basically ask me once, ask me twice, ask me a third time.
00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:22.000 I'm doing something wrong.
00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:27.000 And what had happened with the loom because I knew what a nightmare was going to be.
00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:31.000 Is, I decentralized from it too much.
00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:37.000 So they were in my office over the course of the first two to three days.
00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:41.000 It might even been a week at least a dozen times.
00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:44.000 So you're red flag for you need it.
00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:48.000 You're too far detached from something is ask once you're not too far to doubt.
00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:49.000 It's just just an issue.
00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:50.000 Ask twice.
00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:51.000 Details.
00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:52.000 I left the detail.
00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:52.000 Yeah.
00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:53.000 Okay.
00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:53.000 Here's a little bit more.
00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:54.000 Third time.
00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:55.000 Got to get them going.
00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:55.000 Yeah.
00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:56.000 Got to make something happen.
00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:57.000 And that's just my own.
00:53:57.000 --> 00:53:59.000 And I think that that helps like, just helps.
00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:00.000 For sure.
00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:01.000 For sure.
00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:04.000 Somebody, if I'm in a combat situation, someone calls me up and say, hey,
00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:08.000 I'm saying, hey, Joaqua, we got movers over there and I'm like, no, we're good.
00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:09.000 They call me again.
00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:10.000 Hey, I think I see something.
00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:12.000 No, there's nothing to be in track.
00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:14.000 Hey, we got some situation down here.
00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:15.000 Guess what?
00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:16.000 I'm going to go find out what's going on.
00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:18.000 And you know what the other thing is?
00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:21.000 Like, what to that end is we were sitting in the golf cart together.
00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:23.000 They didn't know I was in the phone with Jill.
00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:25.000 And she called me and we're at camp right now.
00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:27.000 And the emergency, or an emergency camp.
00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:29.000 And she called me and she's like, hey,
00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:33.000 the cover stitch, we're spending the sheeness down for you.
00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:36.000 You know, our last, our last, the waistband.
00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:39.000 And I said, okay, did you call Bill?
00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:42.000 And she's like, yes, but he can't come in.
00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:43.000 That's it.
00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:44.000 Let me call him.
00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:45.000 She said, okay, come.
00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:46.000 Bill, can you come in?
00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:48.000 I can't come into a one.
00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:49.000 That's good enough.
00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:50.000 But you can be there today.
00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:51.000 So yes, I called Jill.
00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:57.000 I said, hey, I need you to ask if Maggie, which is one of our stitches,
00:54:57.000 --> 00:54:59.000 can stay late.
00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:02.000 So that she builds going to come in and fix the machine.
00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:05.000 So that she can get production done.
00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:07.000 What does that do to Jill?
00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:10.000 Let me dig a little deeper into that machine.
00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:13.000 So when we showed up at the factory the other day, everything was back up and going
00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:14.000 without Bill.
00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:16.000 So at the same time, not that flank.
00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:18.000 And I've learned a lot about flanking.
00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:20.000 I would have driven over there.
00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:21.000 I wouldn't let the session.
00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:25.000 But showing her that somebody else is going to be half the be put out.
00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:26.000 I'm going to be put out.
00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:28.000 Bill's going to be a little put out.
00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:30.000 Maggie's going to be put out because she asked to work late.
00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:33.000 So there's three people that are willing and ready.
00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:38.000 And there's one that probably could just dig a little bit deeper to see what the problem is
00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:39.000 and come to find out.
00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:41.000 She fixed it.
00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:44.000 And Jill getting it done.
00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:44.000 Yeah.
00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:48.000 So is, you know, it's just, and she and I'm sure, and I haven't talked to her yet.
00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:52.000 I haven't seen her since then, but I'm sure she thought about that.
00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:56.000 And learned from it because she's listened to extreme ownership.
00:55:56.000 --> 00:55:58.000 And she can't wait for the next book that caught me on the leadership.
00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:01.000 But she's listened and read and she listens to your podcast.
00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:03.000 And everybody in the factory listens to the podcast.
00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:05.000 We've got Cindy up in shipping.
00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:06.000 Who's like, she's got it on.
00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:07.000 She's got it on.
00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:07.000 She's got it on.
00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:08.000 She's like, what?
00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:09.000 She's like, what?
00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:11.000 I'm listening to the track.
00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:14.000 And I'm like, okay, you keep talking up there.
00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:16.000 So I spoke by the river there.
00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:17.000 And she's like, look at my setup.
00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:21.000 She's got like four YouTube tabs open.
00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:22.000 Dockle podcast.
00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:23.000 Dockle podcast.
00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:25.000 She's not listening to four.
00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:27.000 It wants, but she might start doing that.
00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:28.000 She's got that.
00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:29.000 She's very big down.
00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:33.000 So in a lot of the staff listens to the podcast.
00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:42.000 And I get a lot of questions from them about because leadership is a skill that is,
00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:46.000 it's acquired through practice.
00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:51.000 You know, people I used to believe, I don't know if I've chosen, I used to believe that you were born
00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:52.000 leader.
00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:53.000 You ever heard that?
00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:55.000 I have, and I've discussed this before.
00:56:55.000 --> 00:57:01.000 There is, you are born with some leadership qualities, some of them are good, some of them are
00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:02.000 bad.
00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:03.000 You can improve.
00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:04.000 Oh, yeah.
00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:07.000 And the more you pay attention to it, the more you will improve.
00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:09.000 The only one person that can improve their leadership.
00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:11.000 And that's the person who lacks humility.
00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:12.000 Yeah.
00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:14.000 If they lack humility, they're not going to get any better.
00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:16.000 Because they're not doing anything wrong.
00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:17.000 And they're mine.
00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:18.000 They're not doing anything wrong.
00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:23.000 You know what the hardest thing though is, at the factory, is we have a lot of different
00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:28.000 life of folks from different walks of life.
00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:32.000 But this is old New England.
00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:38.000 It's not quite the New England we're talking about, but there's a lot of parallels because
00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:42.000 of the recession and the lack of jobs and the lack of factories.
00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:47.000 So for the folks who didn't go to college and I don't even think, I'm going to say right
00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:52.000 out, like, I haven't said to my kids which college are you going to.
00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:55.000 I've asked them many times what would you like to do.
00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:59.000 But I'm not one of those parents who's like, which college you going to?
00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:01.000 And I think that's okay too.
00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:06.000 I'm not saying it's not, I've seen both ends of the spectrum from my own experience.
00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:09.000 And I don't want to pressure them to go into the trades.
00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:12.000 It's great money that you know, in all these different opportunities, especially with the
00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:13.000 resurgence of manufacturing.
00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:16.000 It's going to be so many opportunities.
00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:21.000 But these people from the different walks of life, sometimes they are finding their
00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:26.000 value in life by doing this work they're doing.
00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:36.000 And what I found is something I didn't know existed and discovered is that they make the
00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:40.000 product together as a community.
00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:43.000 And that product goes to the consumer and in the past that ended.
00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:45.000 Those two things there was one and there was the other.
00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:50.000 Now the person who puts their hands on it on this end and the person who puts their hand on it on
00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:56.000 the other end have a relationship because of new media, because of social media.
00:58:56.000 --> 00:58:59.000 And so they don't just get fulfillment by making the product.
00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:05.000 They also get fulfillment by seeing that product being used and being appreciated.
00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:12.000 And with extreme ownership when this person here on this end, they're the worker, the worker.
00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:17.000 They're finding that they find their being and they find so much value.
00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:20.000 It's like it's a powerful thing.
00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:26.000 I have to be very careful in my own leadership ways not to take that away from them.
00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:31.000 And so that approach has got to be perfect person.
00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:34.000 So I have to shift the way I talked to people.
00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:36.000 I got to shift.
00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:44.000 I can have like 25 conversations and I would have it 25 different ways depending on who the person is.
00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:47.000 And you learned that by practice.
00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:48.000 Yep.
00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:56.000 So speaking of too much ownership and the dichotomy of extreme ownership because there is one.
00:59:56.000 --> 01:00:02.000 You got, I got you one of the copies of the new book, dichotomy of leadership.
01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:06.000 Where deck fall out in your brain?
01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:09.000 Well I sat down.
01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000 I'm not a big reader.
01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:15.000 I mean because it was an audio book, I got the paper copy.
01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:23.000 So I sat down on a dock, on a little cabin on the lake.
01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:27.000 And I sat down and everybody was around me and I was just in it.
01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000 And it sucked me in.
01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:32.000 And I've never had a book sucked me in.
01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:33.000 Dang.
01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:34.000 Yeah.
01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:40.000 So it's the first one I ever got sucked into and all of a sudden I looked up and the sun was going down behind the mountains.
01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000 And everybody was gone.
01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000 I was like, what happened?
01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:49.000 And you know it's one, I'm going to tell you like extreme ownership.
01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:52.000 Everybody needs to read or listen to.
01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:59.000 dichotomy of leadership is actually going to correct your brain.
01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:03.000 Like you think you know because you read that book.
01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:06.000 Now it's time for us to tweak what you're thinking.
01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:10.000 So it's powerful.
01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:16.000 And I think for anybody like my little sister and my brother-in-law, their ed tax and their,
01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000 it's, they're in a whole different game.
01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000 You know they're working with children.
01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:23.000 It's just so valuable.
01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:24.000 It's life lessons.
01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:30.000 You know something I realized so as Lafin, I've been talking about why we wrote the book, the dichotomy of leadership.
01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000 Why we picked that topic.
01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:38.000 And what we've been saying is most of the questions that we would get asked would be about the dichotomy of leadership.
01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000 That's completely true.
01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:44.000 But I'll tell you on top of that, more important.
01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:51.000 Most of the answers that I give are that there's a dichotomy in leadership and you need to be balanced.
01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:54.000 That is what you, even today I got asked at camp.
01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000 Hey, Jocco.
01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:59.000 I'm a white belt, but I want to be default aggressive.
01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:02.000 But I also hear you tell me to relax all the time.
01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:03.000 Which one is it?
01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:04.000 What do you want me to do?
01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000 Should I be default aggressive and get after it?
01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:07.000 Yeah.
01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:12.000 Or you, you tell me relax and I actually, you know, I say relax harger, right?
01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000 You try to relax harger.
01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:15.000 Which one do you want me to do?
01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000 And I said, well, luckily in Lafin, they're two.
01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:18.000 I'm like, left, luckily.
01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:22.000 For this very reason, Lafin, I just wrote a book called The dichotomy of leadership.
01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000 And there's a dichotomy with aggression.
01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000 Even though I say default aggressive and I say,
01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:29.000 that's got to be your mindset, that's got to be your default bonus.
01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000 You're going to be aggressive and you're going to go get after it.
01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:35.000 And there's a chapter in the book that doesn't mean that you run to your death.
01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:41.000 You have to balance that with caution, with energy conservation,
01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:46.000 with not wasting movement on the mat, with not wasting capital in business,
01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:51.000 without burning bridges, like all those things you have to be balanced.
01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:54.000 And that's why I think like you, that's a great way of putting it.
01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:58.000 It's going to, it's going to recalibrate and fix your brains.
01:02:58.000 --> 01:02:59.000 Yes.
01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:02.000 I've had a lot of these conversations with Be Little, you know?
01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:03.000 Okay.
01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:06.000 Because he's a different beast than I am.
01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000 I'm pretty passive.
01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:11.000 Like, do your job, do it right.
01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000 Like, I'll help anywhere I can.
01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:14.000 And that's just in general, right?
01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:15.000 Like, I'm there.
01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:16.000 Like, I'm there.
01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000 I'm always on contact me any time a day.
01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:22.000 And so Be Little's in a leadership position.
01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:25.000 Sometimes like, jacos says, you ever get that?
01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000 Jacos says.
01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:28.000 Oh, yeah.
01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:32.000 So the jacos says thing in, you know, jacos says default aggressive.
01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000 Jacos says this.
01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:39.000 And the idea isn't that in your brain, you're thinking,
01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000 jacos says.
01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:45.000 The idea is that you, you, you rewire your brain so that
01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:49.000 in neatly, you're saying something and not thinking about what
01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:53.000 Jacos would say, you know, you want to make it your own.
01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:56.000 And that's a real ownership when we're talking about a little bit of a real
01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:00.000 ownership is that you're not just saying it, but you're understanding what you're
01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000 saying and why you're saying it.
01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:06.000 And the words are coming not as a game, but as truth because that's what you
01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:07.000 believe in.
01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:10.000 And that I think takes a long time for people.
01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:15.000 I thought where you're going with the jacos says is when, when the
01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:20.000 subordinate uses your name to make something happen, right?
01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:21.000 Exactly.
01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:22.000 Exactly.
01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000 Hey, well, hey, Jacos, this is where we're going to do things.
01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:25.000 And it's like, okay, well, that's not.
01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000 Why do you need to say that?
01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000 That's the same as saying I don't rank you.
01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000 That's the same as saying, look, exactly.
01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:32.000 I don't rank you.
01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:33.000 And just what we're going to do it.
01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000 Hey, Jacos said that's what he wants.
01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:36.000 It doesn't make any sense.
01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:37.000 Jacos said that's what he wants.
01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:38.000 Like you can't do that.
01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:39.000 You can't do that.
01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:42.000 You can't use your boss's name as your authority.
01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:46.000 If what your boss has told you to make happen doesn't make sense.
01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:49.000 And you can't explain why it makes sense.
01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:52.000 You need to go to back to your boss and say hey boss, I'm having some trouble here.
01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000 Can you explain to me why we're doing it this way?
01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:58.000 So I can explain that down the chain of command to the troops and it's going on in the field.
01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000 And you know what else is real important?
01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:11.000 And I believe that I think I took away this year is like the 70 30, the 80 20, the 90 10.
01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:25.000 If if if there's a decision that needs to be made in and someone else is 70% there and you're the leader and in your mind you're 90% there.
01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:26.000 What do you do?
01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:27.000 Yep.
01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:28.000 All day long.
01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:33.000 Because 70% and that has been a hard lesson for me.
01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:34.000 Yeah.
01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:35.000 But I'm getting it.
01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000 Did I tell you about the fabric the other day?
01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:38.000 No.
01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:43.000 I went down Friday because I was like hey we got it got the factory.
01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:46.000 We got you know 400 people coming to the factory from all over the world.
01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000 I want this place to look tight.
01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:54.000 And I walked down the spiral staircase into the bunker and we have the the dumpster the daily dump right.
01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:58.000 And in the dumpster is these fabric rolls.
01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:03.000 And there's like you know 10 or 20 yards on each one.
01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:04.000 And John was there.
01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:07.000 He's he's overseeing and he was our first employee.
01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:08.000 And he knows the process.
01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:09.000 He knows the factory.
01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:12.000 And he's overseeing everything.
01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:17.000 And I told Ryan, make sure this the other day.
01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:22.000 I put my hand on the fabric and I had this attachment to it.
01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:25.000 It's like five was like padding it.
01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000 And I was like okay what am I doing?
01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:28.000 What am I doing?
01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000 And I look up and I go John has it.
01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000 Why is this fabric in the dumpster?
01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:35.000 It was the first fabric we made.
01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000 That's why I have an attachment to it.
01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:40.000 He's like it had to go.
01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000 And I was like.
01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:43.000 Yeah.
01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000 Why being the tear from my eye?
01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:48.000 I'm like how do I handle this situation?
01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:54.000 I'm thinking why didn't he cut off a yard or like a like why is it in the dumpster?
01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:59.000 And I didn't want to pull it out of the dumpster because it didn't on an overall what he has decision he made.
01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000 He said Pete, you said.
01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:06.000 You know how many times we've cut that by accident because it's a white.
01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:13.000 And how much time we've wasted doing that and moving it around every time we need to get something.
01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:16.000 I said yes.
01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:26.000 And he's like I had so I threw it away and I go okay as I kind of like stroke my hand along the dumpster and kept walking even the factory.
01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000 It was a 50 50.
01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:32.000 It wasn't a 70 30 20 is a 50 50.
01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:37.000 I wanted to go back down that night and pull it all out of the dumpster before the truck came in the morning.
01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:38.000 I didn't.
01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000 I just left it and you know what?
01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:41.000 It felt great.
01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:42.000 Why?
01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:43.000 Because we don't need it.
01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:44.000 Yeah.
01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:45.000 We don't need it.
01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:46.000 He's right.
01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:47.000 We don't freaking need that fabric.
01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:50.000 You know if I wanted to weave fabric like that we have the knowledge base.
01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:51.000 We can weave fabric like that.
01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:52.000 Doesn't matter.
01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:53.000 Right.
01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:54.000 What is it matter?
01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:57.000 Because it's I have this emotional attachment to it because it was the first fabric we would.
01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:58.000 What?
01:07:58.000 --> 01:07:59.000 What?
01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:00.000 Whatever.
01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:01.000 It's gone.
01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:02.000 I'm good.
01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:03.000 Move on.
01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000 I had to let him make the decision.
01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:06.000 That's a rough one.
01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:07.000 That's a rough one.
01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000 I've thought it was a rough board.
01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:10.000 I've talked about this.
01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000 I've got a lot of t-shirts.
01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:13.000 Yeah.
01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:14.000 For what?
01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:15.000 That's a rough one.
01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:16.000 I've got a lot of t-shirts.
01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:17.000 Yeah.
01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:20.000 Because I have like from Gjitsu tournaments that I was in in 1996.
01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:21.000 He's got to keep those.
01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:31.000 I've got a lot of t-shirts.
01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000 And I've got a lot of t-shirts.
01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:34.000 I've got one for you.
01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:37.000 She wants to throw those right in the dumpster.
01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:38.000 Yeah.
01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:39.000 No.
01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:40.000 They're in the drawer.
01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:41.000 But just to everything else.
01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:46.000 Before you send me this recommendation, because I know on social media a lot of people hit me up last time.
01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:49.000 Saying, hey, you can get quilts made with your old t-shirts.
01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:50.000 Yeah.
01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:53.000 And if it comes down to it, we've got a factory full of work.
01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:54.000 So it can make you quilts.
01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:55.000 Oh.
01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:56.000 They would love to.
01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000 Oh, they would all be like, we're making Jokka.
01:08:58.000 --> 01:08:59.000 We're quail.
01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:00.000 Yeah.
01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000 I'd actually shut down the factory for a day.
01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:06.000 I literally would for an exercise, just like a group exercise.
01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:07.000 Send them over, dude.
01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:08.000 We'll make it happen.
01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:09.000 I went in on that big time.
01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000 You took a couple of your t-shirts.
01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:12.000 How many t-shirts do you have?
01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:13.000 Planning.
01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:14.000 Oh, planning.
01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:15.000 Yeah.
01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:16.000 Yeah.
01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:17.000 I had a shirt.
01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:18.000 I had a sweatshirt.
01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:21.000 I wore it every day for 10 years.
01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:22.000 Yeah.
01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:23.000 It was yellow.
01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:24.000 Oh, I know.
01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:25.000 My wife called it Big Bird.
01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:26.000 She threw out Big Bird.
01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:27.000 Yeah.
01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000 I'm emotionally scarred from it.
01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:30.000 Yeah.
01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:31.000 I had a pair of shorts.
01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:35.000 I had a pair of like crappy real thin cotton.
01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:36.000 Cotton.
01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:37.000 I don't think cotton.
01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:38.000 Yeah.
01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:39.000 Cotton.
01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000 They were the most comfortable shorts ever.
01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:44.000 And I'd wear them around the house on like a Saturday.
01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000 You know, just cruising.
01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000 And maybe this was the end of my cruising curve.
01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000 My wife just threw them away.
01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:51.000 Just threw them away.
01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:52.000 No reason.
01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000 Just a ruthless woman.
01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000 They were stinging away.
01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:00.000 So that actually explains a lot because we're so on the same page.
01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:03.000 It's kind of scary when it comes to making durable goods and making all the new gear.
01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000 We're going to be launching next year.
01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:06.000 Is that.
01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:10.000 And no one somebody said to me recently is people are in life.
01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:15.000 Their their attention is being pulled and it's everywhere.
01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:16.000 Your mind is everywhere.
01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:19.000 The last thing you want to do is be uncomfortable.
01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:22.000 That's the last thing you want.
01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:25.000 You can be uncomfortable in life with everything you're doing.
01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:28.000 But when we're sitting here, I'm sitting here and some new grappling shorts.
01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:29.000 Because they're I looked in my suitcase.
01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:30.000 I dug through everything.
01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000 I was like, what am I going to be comfortable in?
01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:35.000 Is this freaking grappling shorts and this teacher?
01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:36.000 Mm-hmm.
01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:37.000 I'm comfortable.
01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:38.000 You know.
01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:41.000 And I think that's valuable.
01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:42.000 I think it's important.
01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000 Or else they wouldn't have been talking about it in the 1600s.
01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:49.000 You don't have textiles or boots to make the apparel we need to be able to work.
01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:50.000 Be comfortable and work.
01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:51.000 Yeah.
01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:56.000 Well, and then I actually call me an idiot.
01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:01.000 But I was more interested in that piece just from the hardships.
01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:04.000 And as I was reading, I was like, he's talking about.
01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000 About yards of cloth in the apparel.
01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:10.000 I feel like a brilliant move for talking about that.
01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:11.000 Yeah.
01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:14.000 I'm a random.
01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000 Really?
01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:17.000 That's pretty good.
01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:18.000 Yeah.
01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:19.000 Not bad.
01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000 You know, as we talk about leadership a lot, always.
01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:22.000 And we talk, but what's interesting.
01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:23.000 I always talk about leadership.
01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:30.000 And people will sometimes ask the kind of typical question of what's different between leadership and management.
01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:31.000 Or do you think leaders and managers are saying,
01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:32.000 thing?
01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:36.000 And I always say, hey, look, you lead people and you manage money and you manage timelines and you manage process.
01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:48.000 You are actively involved on a daily basis in doing both and doing both in both leading people and managing the process.
01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:54.000 So you're not just growth and leadership this year, but also in process and management.
01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:55.000 Yeah.
01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000 And I'm not the best.
01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:02.000 You know, I mean, we have a great team of people that help.
01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:05.000 Like, I'm all over the place.
01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:09.000 When it comes to that as far as I enjoy it.
01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:12.000 But at the same time, I need to be kept in check.
01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:17.000 Like, you can spend too much time in one area and not in the other area.
01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:23.000 But as far as the process and the team, for me, they're one and the same.
01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:28.000 If you build the team, then you'll get the process together.
01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:31.000 Because you're all moving the same direction.
01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:32.000 It's like draft.
01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:35.000 It's like drafting.
01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:36.000 You know, I scroll.
01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:37.000 Yeah, you know, you're going to draft.
01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:38.000 It's the same thing.
01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000 One person's out front and they're kind of doing this.
01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:43.000 And you know what, we're not catching any wind behind them.
01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:46.000 And we're just able to coast and move behind them and make our changes.
01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000 Those little micro changes we need to make as we flow.
01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:51.000 And when you get a whole line of cars like that, you're all just flowing.
01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000 And that's what it's like in the factory.
01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:54.000 So it's not me.
01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:58.000 You know, I mean, I'm taking your leadership techniques and, you know,
01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:02.000 these, this way of thinking is what it is.
01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:03.000 It's a way of thinking.
01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:06.000 And I'm just kind of filtering it down the chain.
01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000 And we've got good people.
01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000 And together we make it happen.
01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:13.000 So I may have started it, but it's not me.
01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:14.000 It's everyone.
01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:17.000 So for a process, the process then is decentralized.
01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:20.000 You've decentralized the way that you create the process.
01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:21.000 Totally.
01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000 And you know, how exactly.
01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000 And it's jujitsu and it's extreme ownership.
01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:26.000 And it's everything.
01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:29.000 It's everything. It's a beautiful thing.
01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:33.000 And you're able to scale at such a rate when you just take.
01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:37.000 When you detach your emotion and you decentralized command.
01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:41.000 And you really believe in it and understand winning it all costs.
01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:44.000 That's the trifecta.
01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000 And that's what happened.
01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:50.000 So we have this one employee Jen and she runs the pants line.
01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:55.000 And she's been doing such a good job with the game.
01:13:55.000 --> 01:14:00.000 The way that I said there had a conversation with her.
01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:03.000 I'm going to take a listen.
01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000 I think you got this. She's like, what?
01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:08.000 I said setting up the new lines.
01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000 You get the process.
01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:11.000 You get.
01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:15.000 You're going to develop the process because you understand what needs to take place.
01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:18.000 Because you've got total buying.
01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:23.000 You know, and she's not buying into.
01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:30.000 She's buying into it as as I'm not a freaking explain it.
01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:34.000 And it sounds kind of weird, but it's total belief.
01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000 No, that's not weird.
01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:39.000 You know, it's belief in the end of end in it.
01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:42.000 And when you really believe in it and you're not going home and saying,
01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:49.000 Pete wants me to listen to Jocco podcast or Pete wants me to read this book or Pete asked me to do this.
01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:52.000 When you're going home and you're saying to your significant other,
01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:57.000 hey, you know what? I was asked to do this and I did it and it worked.
01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:00.000 And it's changing my life, not just that work.
01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000 It's actually changing my life here.
01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000 And I want to do this better in life.
01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:05.000 Yeah.
01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:06.000 That's powerful.
01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:11.000 I look at the difference between someone that says, oh, this is what I have to do at work.
01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:14.000 And this is what I am doing at work.
01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:14.000 Yeah.
01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:18.000 Because when they say that, that's inherent in that statement is they own it.
01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:22.000 And when you get people that own it, it's theirs.
01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:23.000 Yeah.
01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:26.000 And they're going to make it right exactly.
01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:27.000 Exactly.
01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:32.000 All right. So you've accomplished a lot with this.
01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:33.000 We have.
01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:34.000 Yeah.
01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000 Well, it started with you.
01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:40.000 You have to be driven by you go just like all of us are, you know,
01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:47.000 to have this vision and think and believe that you can take a 20 year old loop and get that thing up and run and make
01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:48.000 close with it.
01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:49.000 That's freaking crazy.
01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:50.000 Yeah.
01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:54.000 But you also do a great job of putting that ego in check.
01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:59.000 And I'm wondering how.
01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:16.000 How do you discriminate between what's positive ego and what's good and what's negative ego and what's bad and to give a little bit of context with a military with task in a bruiser, right?
01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:24.000 I want everyone of those guys to believe that we are the best task unit in the history of the world.
01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:25.000 That's who we are.
01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:31.000 And at the same time, the dichotomy is I want them to think, oh, we need to do better.
01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:32.000 We're not good enough.
01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:33.000 We need to keep training.
01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:34.000 We can't cut any corners.
01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000 And that's basically what you have to do.
01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000 I have to do as individuals.
01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000 I know I'm always trying to do that.
01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000 What do you see from your perspective?
01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000 How do you know when it's your positive ego?
01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:48.000 That's going to help drive things in a positive way versus your negative ego.
01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:52.000 That's going to negatively impact decisions that you're supposed to make.
01:16:52.000 --> 01:17:03.000 Not based on what's the best for the company or best for the future or best for long term, but best thing for your real psycho ego that wants to just eat all these cupcakes.
01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:06.000 You have full.
01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:13.000 So I think I think the succeed in life you have to have a.
01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:16.000 A confidence in ego a swagger.
01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:19.000 And I like swagger.
01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:24.000 But you also have to be a bit naive and ego makes you naive.
01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000 It's really what it is.
01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000 And I'll give you a good example.
01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:32.000 I have this my buddy, Dustin Ireland.
01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:37.000 And he's an eight-hand pilot and he's like the top eight-hand pilot in the world.
01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:38.000 He taught it.
01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:39.000 Red flag.
01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:43.000 And he taught it to the start for the joint chiefs now and he's making his way up.
01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:44.000 Who knows where to end up?
01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000 Where we're kids.
01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:51.000 We used to do everything together, but we were so competitive.
01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:57.000 And I had an ego, he had a little bit of an ego by 7th grade.
01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:00.000 We were almost dunking basketballs.
01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:03.000 By 8th grade we were both dunking basketballs.
01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:06.000 I'm a 6th, 3, he's 5-9.
01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:10.000 That's what happened.
01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:13.000 Well, you got to believe you can.
01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:19.000 And the way you believe you can is by having a mindset that you can't be stopped.
01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000 That's ego.
01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:22.000 That's swagger.
01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000 That's confidence.
01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.000 But it's different.
01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:29.000 It's different believing it and.
01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:33.000 Putting on blinders and getting into a state of mind.
01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:37.000 Putting on blinders and getting into a fog.
01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:41.000 Then looking side to side as you're moving forward.
01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:45.000 And making sure there's not a fog in front of you and the fog is emotion.
01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:53.000 And the fog is when that wells up inside you because you need to prove something that you're going to do this.
01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000 You're going to be this.
01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000 I think that.
01:18:57.000 --> 01:19:00.000 It's relationship based too.
01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:13.000 Where if someone's coming at you negatively and you're meeting that negativity with any emotional response, you got ego.
01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000 You got ego.
01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:18.000 And at that point you got to self-check.
01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:23.000 And I think the difference is those who are able to self-check know how to adjust there.
01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:24.000 You go on the fly.
01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000 You've got to know how to self-check.
01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:36.000 A lot of that comes through understanding that there's a lot of people chasing you that are born every day that are going to do great things that you're here for a moment in time.
01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:39.000 And that you're not special.
01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.000 But believe you're special because you are.
01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:44.000 You know, and there's a dichotomy in that also.
01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:47.000 So I think there's a lot to it and honestly.
01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:51.000 I don't think I was a man until I was in my 30s.
01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:56.000 And I still think I'm working towards manhood and I truly believe that. I truly believe like extreme ownership.
01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.000 I believe I'm still working towards manhood.
01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:00.000 And I have a long freaking way to go.
01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:05.000 So I don't know how you teach that.
01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:10.000 I think you can listen to the lessons of others.
01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:16.000 You know, you listen to your podcast, which is very powerful for people to listen to.
01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:20.000 And I think a lot of people here, that's the reason when you talk to them.
01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:26.000 And you know, in these private conversations, they, they just seems like they all have the same type of mindset.
01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:29.000 You know what I mean?
01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:32.000 But yeah, I mean, you go.
01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:36.000 You go as a strong and powerful tool if it's utilized right and you harness that ego.
01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:37.000 You can do great things.
01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:43.000 But if you hang on to it like it's your only tool, you're going to fail.
01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.000 You've got to be careful with that one.
01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:48.000 There's a difference to between.
01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:51.000 ego and pride.
01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000 And they're very similar.
01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:54.000 Maybe they're the same.
01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.000 Maybe they're just close cousins.
01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.000 Maybe they're brothers and sisters.
01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000 Maybe they're twins.
01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:01.000 But.
01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:06.000 But because, you know, pride is one of the seven deadly sins.
01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:10.000 But at the same time, of course, you want people to be proud of what they do.
01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:17.000 And, you know, I know, like again with a single platoon, you want those guys to get done with a block of training and have pride that they did it better.
01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000 They did it better than they were,
01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000 target that they got after it.
01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:22.000 That's what you want.
01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:29.000 But you just have to make sure that it doesn't influence and start to cause problems elsewhere.
01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:36.000 Well, ego is like, if you want to, if you want to distill it, it's like, you know, there's no eye and team.
01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.000 That's ego.
01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:42.000 When it's individualized, it's ego.
01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:46.000 When it's a team effort and everyone's on the same page and moving towards the same purpose.
01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.000 It's confidence.
01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:52.000 You know, and it can be defined by, is it about you or is it about this?
01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000 Is it about all of us?
01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.000 Or is it just about me?
01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:59.000 So that's a constant struggle.
01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000 I think for a lot of entrepreneurs.
01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:06.000 I think for a lot of people in leadership is, it's not about you.
01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:09.000 You know, it really isn't about you.
01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:13.000 It's about what you're doing and how you're doing it.
01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:19.000 And that you play a role in that, but you're not, you're not the lead role.
01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:22.000 You know, you're, you're, it's not a one man movie.
01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:27.000 You know, it's, it's, it takes a supporting cast and that supporting cast is everybody behind the curtains.
01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:28.000 That no one sees.
01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:34.000 And, yeah, how's it dealing with me?
01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:37.000 Really, would use great.
01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:40.000 You know what's funny is,
01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:48.000 we both have a certain level of ego, but we both don't.
01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:56.000 Because if you, if you check me, like, hey, and you can ask a simple question and flank me real quick.
01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.000 And be like, I've got to, and let me shift my thinking real quick.
01:22:58.000 --> 01:22:59.000 Give me a second or whatever.
01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000 We're having a conversation yesterday.
01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.000 And I was like, well, think about this.
01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:04.000 Well, what do you think about this?
01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.000 And I'm not going to share what that was.
01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.000 And, you know, you pause.
01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:11.000 And you don't react to your respond.
01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:12.000 I like that.
01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:20.000 Because I know you're coming to me with a real answer that is you're emotionally detached from.
01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:22.000 And you thought about before you responded.
01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:25.000 And if it was an ego driven, you just wouldn't like do that.
01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000 Just provide you to this.
01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.000 You know, what you stop, and you take about it.
01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:34.000 And that's real good.
01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:37.000 The other thing that's great about working with you is
01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:40.000 that you're really good.
01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000 And you're, you're real unique, right?
01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:45.000 Because you're this, you're this.
01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000 You have a lot of influence, first of all.
01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:52.000 Over a lot of diverse, it's a diverse group of people.
01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:57.000 I've seen, I mean, just at this camp, if you look at the people that you've touched that are here.
01:23:57.000 --> 01:24:03.000 Men, women, younger, older, from all different,
01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:08.000 let's say, backgrounds, racial backgrounds, cultural backgrounds.
01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000 Like there's tons of different types of people.
01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000 And that's a sampling.
01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:15.000 That's just a sampling of the people you touch.
01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:19.000 You know, and for me to check my ego and look at you and say, well, how can
01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:22.000 Jocco touch these people the way he does?
01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:26.000 Then I need to dig deeper and find out why.
01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:32.000 You know, and it takes a human, someone who who understands
01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:37.000 humility to do that.
01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:40.000 Because your background is very unique.
01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:41.000 There's not everyone.
01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:42.000 That's a Navy seal.
01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:45.000 There's not everyone's a Jiu-Sup Black Belt.
01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:52.000 There's not everyone that runs a leadership company that's sought out by some of the big companies in the world.
01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:57.000 So I check my ego to be like, man, he's maybe sound real cool.
01:24:57.000 --> 01:25:00.000 I check my ego to be like, man, Jocco actually's going to help me.
01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:07.000 So when I call you, I'm not like, I'm like, yeah, I'm just going to call Jocco and figure this out.
01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:10.000 I'm like, okay, Jocco's on the west coast.
01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:11.000 I check my ego.
01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:12.000 I check everything he's okay.
01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.000 Jocco's on the west coast.
01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:17.000 I know he's probably traveling, you know, Monday and Wednesday.
01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:18.000 He's going to be in the airport.
01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.000 He's going to be getting hit up.
01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:24.000 I'm going to reach out to him at this time and see if he's got five minutes for a phone call
01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:27.000 because I know how much your time is worth.
01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:33.000 So which is interesting because you know what I think about working with you, right?
01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.000 Which is, which is awesome.
01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:38.000 And I think the quickest way to explain it.
01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:43.000 And I'm the only reason I'm talking about this is because I think there's lessons to be learned from it.
01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:46.000 You and I make big decisions.
01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:47.000 Big decisions.
01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:48.000 Quickly.
01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:49.000 Quickly.
01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:53.000 With and the key factor in making big decisions quickly between you and me,
01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:59.000 decisions that have a lot of money on blind decisions that have people's, you know, livelihoods on the lines.
01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000 We're making decisions like that.
01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:04.000 And there's like no ego.
01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:07.000 So in other words, I think you might hit me up.
01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:10.000 Hey, I think we should do this.
01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.000 And maybe I have a different idea.
01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:15.000 And I just completely remove the fact that it's my idea or your idea.
01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:18.000 It's like who, which one of these two ideas is better?
01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:19.000 It's better.
01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000 I don't care who where it came from.
01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:25.000 And and you and I, I know we got some similar parts of our personality.
01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:28.000 Obviously, we got some pretty divergent parts too.
01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:32.000 That's across the over and and so it's it's good to be able to just say,
01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:42.000 Okay, I don't care whose idea this is, which one of these two divergent ideas is going to be the better one for what we're trying to do,
01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:46.000 which one is going to deliver more satisfaction to the people we're trying to serve,
01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:49.000 you know, which is what we're always thinking about.
01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:53.000 How is this going to help the people that we're trying, the people that are trying that we're trying to serve?
01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.000 How we can help with how can we help more?
01:26:55.000 --> 01:27:04.000 And you know what's funny is when you know you, your ego is playing a role in your decision making is when you have to say something like this.
01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:08.000 I'm emotionally detached.
01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:13.000 Number one, if you have to say it, you are number two.
01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.000 Number two, I'm completely detached right now.
01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:22.000 Number two, you have to qualify your next statement by and I've done this a few times and I feel like such a douchebag.
01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:25.000 You have to qualify your statement by this.
01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000 I've done this for 20 years.
01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.000 I've expert in it.
01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.000 Yeah.
01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.000 He's expert expert marketer marketer.
01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:37.000 So then then I get out phones like one, I do you should bad.
01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:42.000 But you've got to understand that that when you have to say those things, we have to qualify those things.
01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:51.000 It's like saying, Jocca says, you know, when you have to qualify your next statement, you've got to go and I do it, you know,
01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:56.000 daily, even well, and in addition to not having an addition to it being your ego that's going up,
01:27:56.000 --> 01:28:01.000 you also don't have a legitimate reason because if it was a legitimate reason, you could articulate it properly.
01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:02.000 Right.
01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:09.000 If I'm trying to say something to you and I say, look bro, these are this, I look, I have a good podcast.
01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:12.000 A lot more people listen to my podcast, you know, podcast, you should listen to me.
01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:16.000 That means I couldn't actually articulate what I was trying to say properly.
01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:20.000 If I could articulate what I was trying to say, you'd go, oh, well, that makes sense.
01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:21.000 Exactly.
01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:24.000 If I can't, then I go, my podcast got more listeners.
01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:26.000 You're so listening to me.
01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:27.000 Yeah.
01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:31.000 Like you said, that would be just men, level 12, douche.
01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.000 But you know, and it's been the same thing.
01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:37.000 Sometimes you've said to me, you said something that you would like to be like, I don't even know why I said that.
01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:40.000 And it was just start laughing about it.
01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:44.000 I'm like, whatever, do what we're doing.
01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:54.000 I was going to say something to that point though, as far as the ego is concerned.
01:28:54.000 --> 01:29:02.000 I think that if you don't have that sense, that feeling, like, it can be done.
01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:03.000 You can do it.
01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:04.000 You will do it.
01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:11.000 But if you don't have that, I don't think you have the best tool you need.
01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:15.000 I said something at one of the masters.
01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:20.000 I said, and it's a dichotomy.
01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:27.000 Believe won't get you anything, but without belief, you won't get anything.
01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:28.000 Exactly.
01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:33.000 So belief by itself, like, you know those people that are, they write a meme.
01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.000 I just had to throw that neck of a voice.
01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:36.000 I always thought that was meme-me.
01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.000 I never knew it was meme-me.
01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:39.000 Is it?
01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:40.000 Well, is it?
01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:41.000 Okay.
01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.000 I was made really close right there.
01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:47.000 The memes that say, you know, if you believe it, you can achieve it.
01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:48.000 Yeah.
01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:50.000 And that's not true.
01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:53.000 Because just believing it does not make you achieve it.
01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:58.000 If you say, I believe I'm going to be able to do 30 pull ups in two weeks.
01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:00.000 And right now I can do seven.
01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:03.000 Believe isn't going to get you there.
01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:04.000 Exactly.
01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:06.000 You have to make it happen.
01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:07.000 That's what you're doing.
01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:12.000 But if you truly don't believe that you can get there, you're not going to make the
01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:14.000 effort to get it done.
01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:15.000 Exactly.
01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:16.000 Because guess what?
01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:20.000 There's going to be times in any pursuit that you make.
01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.000 There's going to be times where you're going to be put in check.
01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:23.000 You're going to be tested.
01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:26.000 You're going to be, you're going to be trials and tribulations.
01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:31.000 And if you don't believe that you can get there, you're going to stop.
01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:34.000 You're going to quit and you're not going to make it.
01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:39.000 So, belief by itself won't get you anywhere.
01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:42.000 But without belief, you're not going anywhere.
01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:45.000 You know what I like to say is that you have this.
01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:47.000 You, there's a dream.
01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:51.000 And a dream is something in a state of sleep.
01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:53.000 Then there's a belief.
01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:56.000 And then there's the thing you're trying to achieve.
01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:57.000 And then there's a void.
01:30:57.000 --> 01:31:01.000 And in that void, you have to fill it with action.
01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.000 You know, stepping forward.
01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:07.000 So dreaming is one thing everybody has dreams.
01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.000 Believing you take it a step further.
01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:12.000 And then filling the void with action makes things happen.
01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:15.000 So, um, we're on the same page.
01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:16.000 I mean, a thousand percent.
01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:18.000 Once again, once again.
01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:22.000 Um, you know, that's, that's awesome.
01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:25.000 I'm glad that, you know, it's awesome to be working.
01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:27.000 And that, the things that we're doing.
01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:28.000 People are digging.
01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:29.000 So that's cool.
01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.000 But I wanted to like actually talk a little bit.
01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000 This is what at GG2 camp right now.
01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:34.000 Can I give them an example, though, of what?
01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:36.000 I want to, I want to just give me an example of like,
01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:39.000 when you, because we're, now because we're doing what we,
01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:42.000 what we would do is like, we work so well together.
01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:43.000 Right?
01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:45.000 We're doing the same damn thing.
01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:48.000 You know, like, we're, like, we work so well that we do work well together.
01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:52.000 But let's give an example of how something could have gone wrong.
01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:55.000 Or let's say we got off track for a minute and came back.
01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:56.000 Right?
01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:57.000 Here we go.
01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:58.000 I designed this packaging.
01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:01.000 And I was like, this is the best packaging.
01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:02.000 This is the nicest packaging.
01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:03.000 What was before?
01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:04.000 It was for a new product.
01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:05.000 We shall not talk about.
01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:06.000 Okay.
01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:07.000 Okay.
01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:08.000 Yeah.
01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:10.000 And so it was, it was colorful.
01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:12.000 It was, it's going to, you know, it's, it's, it's perfect.
01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:14.000 It was great.
01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:15.000 Yeah.
01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:16.000 I think it was funny.
01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.000 Yeah.
01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:19.000 I did try to thank you.
01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:20.000 And you tried to flank me.
01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:21.000 I did.
01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:24.000 I did try to thank you.
01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:27.000 And so I showed it to be little and Megan.
01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:30.000 And, you know, like, that's awesome.
01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:34.000 I was like, yeah, I was like, I went a little over the top with it.
01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:37.000 But it, like, this packaging would be the best.
01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:38.000 Right?
01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:39.000 That's what I told them.
01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:40.000 I built myself up.
01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:41.000 I built them up.
01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:45.000 This packaging would be the best because of my expertise.
01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:46.000 Right?
01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:51.000 And, uh, and Brian's like, what's jacquo going to think about it?
01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.000 And I was like, doesn't matter.
01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:54.000 Doesn't matter.
01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:55.000 Yeah.
01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:56.000 Exactly.
01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:57.000 Doesn't matter.
01:32:57.000 --> 01:33:00.000 So here I have, did you say, did you say, like, you know what, we'll, we'll explain it to him.
01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:01.000 We'll get him.
01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:02.000 Yeah.
01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:05.000 I said he's going to bring it down a level from what it is.
01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:09.000 But hopefully we'll hit somewhere in between.
01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:13.000 And so Brian, and then Brian's like, bro, if he doesn't, Mike,
01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:16.000 that's just ridiculous.
01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:18.000 And I'm like, no, I should do that.
01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:20.000 I don't even worry about it.
01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:21.000 I should, I don't even worry about it.
01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:22.000 I should, I don't even worry about it.
01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:23.000 I should, I don't even worry about it.
01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:24.000 I should, I don't even worry about it.
01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:29.000 So I said it to you and it was like, no response.
01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:33.000 And then you have like, you know, you iced me.
01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:39.000 And in part of part of this, and when I'm talking about drafting, right?
01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:44.000 Like, okay, my ego comes into play and then Jaco Zigo comes into play.
01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:47.000 And then he says something, then I'd back off.
01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.000 And then it comes back and his goes back.
01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:50.000 And it back up.
01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:52.000 So there's just constant, but that's not ego.
01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:53.000 It's not ego.
01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:56.000 It's coming to a decision that's best.
01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:59.000 So like, after this call, it's called a rainbow, right?
01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:02.000 Then all of a sudden you like make the rainbow black.
01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:03.000 The whole rainbow.
01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:04.000 The whole rainbow.
01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:05.000 Just make a black.
01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:06.000 The whole rainbow.
01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:08.000 And that would be kind of cool.
01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:13.000 So I go out to Brian now and I was like, yeah, Jaco doesn't like it.
01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:19.000 And he like stands up and he's like, bro, he's like, if he doesn't like,
01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:23.000 just like, I don't know, I know, he lives like a man or he can't.
01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:24.000 He's not cool.
01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:26.000 He's trying to be sensible.
01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:28.000 Yeah, yeah, of course he is.
01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:33.000 So like, I literally, and then I like, then, then I literally,
01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:36.000 I was like, he's got on brand.
01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:39.000 It's not right. And so I made a quick check, right?
01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:43.000 And I was like, dude, I said, you know, I said, I think the packaging
01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:46.000 were great, but you know what?
01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:50.000 Let me go back to the drawing board because I haven't seen
01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:51.000 what else it could look like.
01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:54.000 How do you freaking know what else it could look like?
01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:57.000 So then I went back to the drawing board and, you know,
01:34:57.000 --> 01:35:01.000 when we pushed a further, we went on brand more with it.
01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:06.000 And then you're like, yeah, not bad. Still not good, whatever.
01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:08.000 You didn't really say this really like.
01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:11.000 First four responses were you for too much.
01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:12.000 Yeah, too much.
01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:13.000 Too much.
01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:14.000 Next one too much.
01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:15.000 Yeah.
01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:15.000 Exactly.
01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:18.000 So you're like, okay, he just wants me to bring this back to the basics.
01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:20.000 So you know what's funny?
01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:23.000 You use the term on brand.
01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:28.000 And that's one of those things I hear get thrown around like about
01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:31.000 brands, right?
01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:34.000 And I was at, I was getting interviewed the other day.
01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:35.000 I was just not something to view.
01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:39.000 And the guy said something about like, you know, it's
01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:42.000 That's impressive how quickly you've built your brand.
01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:43.000 Right.
01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:47.000 And I looked at him and I said, I'm not a brand.
01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.000 I'm a person.
01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:50.000 I'm a person.
01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:57.000 What I'm doing is not what I'm doing so that I can leverage.
01:35:57.000 --> 01:36:01.000 People.
01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:05.000 What I do is just me and I'm just a person.
01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:11.000 So if you asked me if I would wear a rainbow t-shirt, I wouldn't.
01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:14.000 No, I've asked you to wear lots of stuff when you have it.
01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:21.000 And if you asked me, but that's not because of I'm trying to be something.
01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.000 It's because that's who I am.
01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:29.000 Right. And I have been, I had one of my brothers who I hadn't seen in a while.
01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:35.000 And he, we met at a little place we'd go to in San Diego.
01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:38.000 And I hadn't seen him in a year and a half.
01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:43.000 And he comes walking in and he sees me and I'm wearing the same thing that I always
01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:44.000 wear.
01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:47.000 Paragines, a victory black t-shirt.
01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:50.000 And he walks in and he sees, and I was wintertime and I was wearing a flannel.
01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:53.000 Like a whatever, like a wick and a new wringling flannel.
01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:58.000 Like a new England, but like cheap whatever flannel with the quilt inside of it.
01:36:58.000 --> 01:36:59.000 Yeah.
01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:05.000 And he sees me and like when he sees me, and this is kind of, you know, after the books in the podcast,
01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:09.000 and he's another seal. So he suspect.
01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:16.000 And he sees me and I see his face and his face like gets happy when he sees me.
01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:20.000 And he comes over and like does like a bro hug.
01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:23.000 And he says, probably you're fucking exactly the same.
01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.000 And I was like, yeah, man.
01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:29.000 And he goes, I fucking knew it.
01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:33.000 And like that to me was the best compliment I'll ever get.
01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:38.000 Is like, okay, no matter what happens, I'm not a brand.
01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:45.000 I'm not doing anything for, you know, any other reason other than it's just me.
01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:46.000 And that's just just what I'm doing.
01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:48.000 And if people are cool with it, man, that's awesome.
01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:49.000 I'm stoked.
01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:55.000 And that's what I love about you because you actually are checking your ego because this is who you are,
01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:57.000 and you're not this person.
01:37:57.000 --> 01:38:02.000 And that's what, that's why you work, you know, that's why it works.
01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:03.000 No rainbows.
01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:04.000 No rainbows, man.
01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:07.000 No rainbow emojis coming from me.
01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:08.000 I don't mind rainbows.
01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:12.000 But echo said, oh, he texted my wife sometimes because they got to organize
01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:16.000 and administrators of, he sent her a unicorn and a rainbow.
01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:17.000 Yeah.
01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:19.000 Should I be pissed at that?
01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:22.000 Should another man send another, should send another placement?
01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:25.000 Was it unicorn then rainbow or rainbow then unicorn?
01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:28.000 I don't know what kind of secret messages are going on over there.
01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:30.000 Was that even moon, bro?
01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:32.000 It's just a soft, very common.
01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:39.000 Would you send another man's wife, a rainbow and a unicorn in a tax, definitely not?
01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:41.000 No, no, no, no, but yes, that's why.
01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:43.000 No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:44.000 You asked a question wrong.
01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:49.000 You, the question is, are there any possible circumstances,
01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:52.000 where it's okay to send a rainbow and a unicorn?
01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:54.000 Well, let me give you an example, echo.
01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:57.000 If you're at, if you like a miscommunication,
01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:58.000 if you're at the load in the air
01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:01.000 and you get the prize, unicorn,
01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:03.000 the fluffy one, do you turn it hand it to your wife
01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:05.000 or do you turn it hand it to Chocco's wife?
01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:06.000 But.
01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:07.000 Okay, so get it.
01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:10.000 I just gave you a little bucket of juice.
01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:10.84 You're my phone.
01:39:10.84 --> 01:39:13.000 On my hand, I'm supposed to go into my dinner.
01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:14.76 Otherwise, any other girls that are
01:39:14.76 --> 01:39:15.96 going to let unicorns all around.
01:39:15.96 --> 01:39:16.76 All around the channel.
01:39:16.76 --> 01:39:17.72 I go hasn't changed.
01:39:17.72 --> 01:39:18.80 And that guy has a train for it,
01:39:18.80 --> 01:39:20.08 but he's coming after my negative.
01:39:20.08 --> 01:39:21.84 I'm back in the front of my girlfriend.
01:39:21.84 --> 01:39:24.76 I'm gripping it, ready to be.
01:39:24.76 --> 01:39:25.36 Yeah, no.
01:39:25.36 --> 01:39:25.96 I was just kidding.
01:39:25.96 --> 01:39:28.08 No, I think it's absolutely okay.
01:39:28.08 --> 01:39:29.64 Because we don't have ego.
01:39:29.64 --> 01:39:30.44 I'm just making sure.
01:39:30.44 --> 01:39:31.76 So we know we're dropping ego.
01:39:31.76 --> 01:39:32.92 Hey, with your own friends.
01:39:32.92 --> 01:39:34.000 Yeah, no, that's cool.
01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:35.32 I guess.
01:39:35.32 --> 01:39:37.76 I don't send his wife unicorns and rain.
01:39:37.76 --> 01:39:38.12 Right.
01:39:38.12 --> 01:39:39.28 But if you did, that's cool.
01:39:39.28 --> 01:39:40.28 In fact, it's a name.
01:39:40.28 --> 01:39:41.28 That's kind of nice.
01:39:41.28 --> 01:39:42.28 Talk to.
01:39:42.28 --> 01:39:43.28 Yeah.
01:39:43.28 --> 01:39:44.28 You know what?
01:39:44.28 --> 01:39:46.28 You want to know what?
01:39:46.28 --> 01:39:49.68 You want to know the only reason why I think it's acceptable.
01:39:49.68 --> 01:39:54.28 That this guy echoed Charles Sands, my wife.
01:39:54.28 --> 01:39:55.28 Unicorns and rainbows.
01:39:55.28 --> 01:39:56.56 Because you love him like a brother.
01:39:56.56 --> 01:40:00.04 No, because he sends me unicorns and rainbows too.
01:40:00.04 --> 01:40:01.04 There you go.
01:40:01.04 --> 01:40:02.04 He keeps running all around.
01:40:02.04 --> 01:40:03.04 Yeah, he keeps.
01:40:03.04 --> 01:40:04.04 He actually sends me.
01:40:04.04 --> 01:40:06.80 I think actually sending me my wife unicorns and rainbows.
01:40:06.80 --> 01:40:07.80 He probably does.
01:40:07.80 --> 01:40:08.80 You know what?
01:40:08.80 --> 01:40:10.80 He has the best flanking technique.
01:40:10.80 --> 01:40:11.80 What is that?
01:40:11.80 --> 01:40:13.56 What do you do?
01:40:13.56 --> 01:40:15.80 He makes sure the wives are happy.
01:40:15.80 --> 01:40:16.80 Oh, yeah.
01:40:16.80 --> 01:40:17.80 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
01:40:17.80 --> 01:40:18.80 Yeah, man.
01:40:18.80 --> 01:40:19.80 Yeah, yeah.
01:40:19.80 --> 01:40:21.80 He has your wife and woman like, I go so nice.
01:40:21.80 --> 01:40:22.80 Oh, yeah.
01:40:22.80 --> 01:40:23.80 Absolutely.
01:40:23.80 --> 01:40:24.80 That's like three unicorns and rainbows.
01:40:24.80 --> 01:40:26.80 All of a sudden he's nice.
01:40:26.80 --> 01:40:28.80 Well, that's why I send him because it's nice.
01:40:28.80 --> 01:40:29.80 So boom, there you go.
01:40:29.80 --> 01:40:30.80 Where is the win win win?
01:40:30.80 --> 01:40:32.80 Yeah, oh, man.
01:40:32.80 --> 01:40:36.40 So I didn't want to before you brought it back to you.
01:40:36.40 --> 01:40:37.40 It's just cool man.
01:40:37.40 --> 01:40:38.40 That's good points, man.
01:40:38.40 --> 01:40:43.20 I mean, I think you, you and I are both like regardless of anything else.
01:40:43.20 --> 01:40:47.04 We're both established human beings, man with families and businesses.
01:40:47.04 --> 01:40:51.40 So there's definitely going to be, I mean, I remember when I met you, I was like, you
01:40:51.40 --> 01:40:53.32 know, this may not work out.
01:40:53.32 --> 01:40:54.92 This may not work out.
01:40:54.92 --> 01:40:58.56 And I was like, you know, this guy, he's done a lot.
01:40:58.56 --> 01:41:00.72 And his ego might be a little bit.
01:41:00.72 --> 01:41:04.92 There might not be enough room for someone else in this picture.
01:41:04.92 --> 01:41:08.28 What I realized is it what it wasn't ego you know what it was.
01:41:08.28 --> 01:41:09.28 It was what I talked about it.
01:41:09.28 --> 01:41:10.72 It was pride.
01:41:10.72 --> 01:41:13.88 You were proud of what you and your team had done.
01:41:13.88 --> 01:41:15.96 Proud of that rightfully so.
01:41:15.96 --> 01:41:17.92 I'd say pride and protection.
01:41:17.92 --> 01:41:18.92 Yeah, yeah.
01:41:18.92 --> 01:41:19.92 Yeah, for sure.
01:41:19.92 --> 01:41:20.92 For sure.
01:41:20.92 --> 01:41:21.92 Like, life's work.
01:41:21.92 --> 01:41:23.92 You know, we just did the kippling poem.
01:41:23.92 --> 01:41:28.92 If everything you put your whole life into, that's what that's what this is.
01:41:28.92 --> 01:41:30.92 And you're like, look at me like a hey man.
01:41:30.92 --> 01:41:33.92 All of a sudden, I can't just let's do a little security check.
01:41:33.92 --> 01:41:34.76 Exactly.
01:41:34.76 --> 01:41:38.08 But you know, I just realized how proud you were of that.
01:41:38.08 --> 01:41:44.60 And that your ego, your ego was, hey, I don't care about that.
01:41:44.60 --> 01:41:48.52 What I care about is making sure that this goes in the right direction.
01:41:48.52 --> 01:41:52.80 There's like, like, what's kind of like what I just said about what is me?
01:41:52.80 --> 01:41:54.44 Well, this is you, right?
01:41:54.44 --> 01:41:59.76 This is like what you built and you want to make sure that it's reflected well.
01:41:59.76 --> 01:42:00.76 Yeah, that's all the time.
01:42:00.76 --> 01:42:01.76 That's it.
01:42:01.76 --> 01:42:03.88 And there's not nothing wrong with that.
01:42:03.88 --> 01:42:07.12 If you didn't have that, you wouldn't be here.
01:42:07.12 --> 01:42:09.76 You wouldn't have made it this far.
01:42:09.76 --> 01:42:10.76 No chance.
01:42:10.76 --> 01:42:11.76 True.
01:42:11.76 --> 01:42:16.88 You've given up after the freaking first tangled bunch of, right?
01:42:16.88 --> 01:42:18.88 It's getting out of the world.
01:42:18.88 --> 01:42:19.88 Yeah.
01:42:19.88 --> 01:42:20.88 All right.

01:42:21.88 --> 01:42:22.88 Yeah, man.
01:42:22.88 --> 01:42:24.88 I want to talk because it's a pretty, do you just can't be awesome?
01:42:24.88 --> 01:42:25.88 Clearly.
01:42:25.88 --> 01:42:26.88 Do you do immersion kippling?
01:42:26.88 --> 01:42:29.88 If you don't want to talk about it's, was it seven days total?

01:42:40.92 --> 01:42:42.12 People are training outside of sessions.
01:42:42.12 --> 01:42:44.48 But you've been running it for seven years.
01:42:44.48 --> 01:42:45.96 Beautiful camp here.

01:42:58.60 --> 01:42:59.60 Thank you.
01:42:59.60 --> 01:43:02.60 I have found the time and brought you candy and a roll.
01:43:02.60 --> 01:43:03.60 You can't throw it into your outer door.
01:43:03.60 --> 01:43:04.60 That's right.
01:43:04.60 --> 01:43:05.60 Really?
01:43:05.60 --> 01:43:06.60 I'm not feeling real.
01:43:06.60 --> 01:43:08.60 But you saw the night tea and I knew.
01:43:08.60 --> 01:43:11.60 I know when you look up that direction.
01:43:11.60 --> 01:43:14.60 You go to the creative party or brain instead of the analytical.
01:43:14.60 --> 01:43:16.60 You see that he's like, can't find this time.
01:43:16.60 --> 01:43:19.60 No matter how good it going with the better words of time.
01:43:19.60 --> 01:43:23.60 It's like on my way, like when I think about it, I'm like doing something and then, you know,
01:43:23.60 --> 01:43:24.60 wanting you're, I'm done doing it.
01:43:24.60 --> 01:43:27.60 I just, you know, it's not in my mind for yet.
01:43:27.60 --> 01:43:30.60 I have not, I have not, I have not probably worked on jumping in the lake.
01:43:30.60 --> 01:43:31.60 Yeah, yeah.
01:43:31.60 --> 01:43:32.60 I've tried this.
01:43:32.60 --> 01:43:34.60 It was so hot when we got here.
01:43:34.60 --> 01:43:38.60 It was actually, I was working out in the morning in the gym and it was, I was sweating.
01:43:38.60 --> 01:43:39.60 So, because I sweat a lot.
01:43:39.60 --> 01:43:40.60 Yeah.
01:43:40.60 --> 01:43:45.60 And I mean, clearly, if you go on my social media, I take some pictures of my sweat sometimes.
01:43:45.60 --> 01:43:47.60 But I was sweating so much.
01:43:47.60 --> 01:43:51.60 It was freaking gross because it was 95 degrees in humid.
01:43:51.60 --> 01:43:54.60 And so there's just Lake Jocco in the gym.
01:43:54.60 --> 01:43:57.60 I get to relax everywhere. I think people were, people were like, oh, fired up.
01:43:57.60 --> 01:43:59.60 Jocco's here. Oh, that's kind of gross.
01:43:59.60 --> 01:44:00.60 No, yeah.
01:44:00.60 --> 01:44:01.60 For a second.
01:44:01.60 --> 01:44:04.60 But then you jump from the lake and then a bunch of people showed up and you were walking down the
01:44:04.60 --> 01:44:07.60 dock and everyone is like, oh, shit.
01:44:07.60 --> 01:44:09.60 Like, king Arthur walking into this house.
01:44:09.60 --> 01:44:11.60 You were just like, you were just like walking.
01:44:11.60 --> 01:44:14.60 And I was like, and I was, I was standing up on my dock when I can't have it.
01:44:14.60 --> 01:44:16.60 And everyone's just like, oh, I'm so shocked.
01:44:16.60 --> 01:44:19.60 Yeah, I remember, remember, remember,
01:44:19.60 --> 01:44:23.60 I remember, remember, Daisy at the factory when when there was the bottle of out there.
01:44:23.60 --> 01:44:29.60 And she came over to me and she said, hey, can I have some bottle of out and you were right next door and she had met you yet.
01:44:29.60 --> 01:44:31.60 She was like, 19 years old.
01:44:31.60 --> 01:44:32.60 And she listens to the podcast.
01:44:32.60 --> 01:44:37.60 And I was like, yeah, you got to ask Jocco wherever she's like, oh, I just want that.
01:44:37.60 --> 01:44:41.60 And I was like, yeah, he's right there and she looks behind her and she looks up and she's like,
01:44:41.60 --> 01:44:43.60 Oh, we're Jocco.
01:44:43.60 --> 01:44:44.60 I was like, what?
01:44:44.60 --> 01:44:50.60 So funny. Anyways, we had like 200 people doing that. So you were just like, and then you got a bomb bar.
01:44:50.60 --> 01:44:52.60 It was awesome.
01:44:52.60 --> 01:44:56.60 Well, I have been hitting the lake after I get out of Lake Jocco in the gym.
01:44:56.60 --> 01:44:56.60 Yeah.
01:44:56.60 --> 01:44:59.60 Then I moved down to Lake Echo and go for a swim.
01:44:59.60 --> 01:45:02.60 And it is awesome. It's been warm too.
01:45:02.60 --> 01:45:02.60 Yeah.
01:45:02.60 --> 01:45:03.60 It's been warm.
01:45:03.60 --> 01:45:05.60 People weren't prepped for the shift.
01:45:05.60 --> 01:45:06.60 Oh, no.
01:45:06.60 --> 01:45:07.60 I warned them. I know.
01:45:07.60 --> 01:45:11.60 I actually posted like videos in my car of the temperature.
01:45:11.60 --> 01:45:15.60 Okay. Here's the temperature. It's 55 degrees. Look, see here.
01:45:15.60 --> 01:45:18.60 It's going to get colder and the daytime's going to be 80 or 90.
01:45:18.60 --> 01:45:20.60 Prepaire for that.
01:45:20.60 --> 01:45:23.60 How people are getting so soon.
01:45:23.60 --> 01:45:28.60 So we're here for Jocco. Not just for swimming and working out, even though that is part of it.
01:45:28.60 --> 01:45:34.60 I was wondering about so it's good to when you do something. You've done this once every year.
01:45:34.60 --> 01:45:36.60 You do it done it for seven years.
01:45:36.60 --> 01:45:40.60 When you have a frame like that, it's like a snapshot in time.
01:45:40.60 --> 01:45:44.60 I wanted to kind of ask you about what you've seen.
01:45:44.60 --> 01:45:50.60 First of all, Jiu Jitsu in terms of the people that are coming to camp.
01:45:50.60 --> 01:45:53.60 Who are they? What's been different?
01:45:53.60 --> 01:45:58.60 I mean, obviously there's a big change this year because we had a lot of people that listen to this podcast.
01:45:58.60 --> 01:45:59.60 Yeah.
01:45:59.60 --> 01:46:00.60 That have come up.
01:46:00.60 --> 01:46:03.60 Probably a couple hundred of them over the two days.
01:46:03.60 --> 01:46:04.60 I would say.
01:46:04.60 --> 01:46:05.60 Yeah. Absolutely.
01:46:05.60 --> 01:46:07.60 And you know what the crazy thing is?
01:46:07.60 --> 01:46:11.60 I actually put my cell phone number and then the public.
01:46:11.60 --> 01:46:12.60 Did I have to try that?
01:46:12.60 --> 01:46:13.60 No.
01:46:13.60 --> 01:46:15.60 Oh yeah. I'm like, hey, you're coming to camp.
01:46:15.60 --> 01:46:16.60 You want to come to camp?
01:46:16.60 --> 01:46:18.60 Got a question. Here's my cell phone.
01:46:18.60 --> 01:46:21.60 So I usually preface it with like don't text me crazy shit.
01:46:21.60 --> 01:46:23.60 Don't ask me random questions.
01:46:23.60 --> 01:46:26.60 But I can answer questions about camp because I want to give.
01:46:26.60 --> 01:46:29.60 I want to give people zero excuses.
01:46:29.60 --> 01:46:30.60 Yeah.
01:46:30.60 --> 01:46:31.60 I didn't know what to expect.
01:46:31.60 --> 01:46:32.60 I didn't know who's going to be coming.
01:46:32.60 --> 01:46:34.60 So the messages I got were like,
01:46:34.60 --> 01:46:36.60 Hey, I listen to Jocco podcast.
01:46:36.60 --> 01:46:38.60 I've never trained you, Jitsu.
01:46:38.60 --> 01:46:40.60 Is this a good time to start?
01:46:40.60 --> 01:46:42.60 Hey, I'm 50 years old.
01:46:42.60 --> 01:46:44.60 I've never trained you, Jitsu.
01:46:44.60 --> 01:46:47.60 Would it be good to come to camp or not?
01:46:47.60 --> 01:46:49.60 You know, a lot of questions like that.
01:46:49.60 --> 01:46:52.60 And every single one I said, I've got a bunch of people.
01:46:52.60 --> 01:46:53.60 Ask them the same question.
01:46:53.60 --> 01:46:54.60 We'd love to have you.
01:46:54.60 --> 01:47:00.60 And it will be the greatest singular experience you will ever have in Jitsu.
01:47:00.60 --> 01:47:04.60 Because you're going to be starting not just an amazing place.
01:47:04.60 --> 01:47:06.60 But with amazing instructors.
01:47:06.60 --> 01:47:08.60 And when I asked the first day,
01:47:08.60 --> 01:47:10.60 everybody raised their hand who hasn't trained you Jitsu before.
01:47:10.60 --> 01:47:12.60 Were you here at that first time?
01:47:12.60 --> 01:47:17.60 We were a couple hours behind 50 people like hand up.
01:47:17.60 --> 01:47:19.60 I was like, I looked at the other instructor like,
01:47:19.60 --> 01:47:20.60 Holy crap.
01:47:20.60 --> 01:47:22.60 If you're listening and you want to train Jitsu,
01:47:22.60 --> 01:47:24.60 I do recommend that you do it.
01:47:24.60 --> 01:47:25.60 There we go.
01:47:25.60 --> 01:47:27.60 I do recommend it's really good for you.
01:47:27.60 --> 01:47:30.60 It really is good for you in so many different ways.
01:47:30.60 --> 01:47:33.60 And to see the people here that have never trained Jitsu.
01:47:33.60 --> 01:47:35.60 You've got to have never trained Jitsu before.
01:47:35.60 --> 01:47:40.60 And see that it's, I don't think any of us, none of us.
01:47:40.60 --> 01:47:44.60 You don't ever get to see 50 people that have never trained Jitsu before.
01:47:44.60 --> 01:47:46.60 Or 75 people that have never trained Jitsu before.
01:47:46.60 --> 01:47:48.60 And you get to teach them all at once.
01:47:48.60 --> 01:47:49.60 At least I've never done that before.
01:47:49.60 --> 01:47:52.60 No, and I mean, you definitely don't get 58 year old,
01:47:52.60 --> 01:47:56.60 7th and judo black belt who have never put on a Jitsu gear before.
01:47:56.60 --> 01:47:58.60 You know, looking for a white belt.
01:47:58.60 --> 01:47:59.60 Yeah.
01:47:59.60 --> 01:48:00.60 And we've got one of them too.
01:48:00.60 --> 01:48:04.60 No, it's, but my point in seeing all the people at one time.
01:48:04.60 --> 01:48:07.60 You know, when you occasionally get a white belt or someone that's never trained before,
01:48:07.60 --> 01:48:08.60 you teach them a couple of moves.
01:48:08.60 --> 01:48:11.60 And you get to see a one spark and someone's brain.
01:48:11.60 --> 01:48:14.60 Go, they start to get it.
01:48:14.60 --> 01:48:16.60 But to see 50 people go,
01:48:16.60 --> 01:48:18.60 it's not the eyes open up.
01:48:18.60 --> 01:48:20.60 And it usually doesn't happen all at once,
01:48:20.60 --> 01:48:22.60 because some people will get it when you get,
01:48:22.60 --> 01:48:23.60 you know, some people make the connection here.
01:48:23.60 --> 01:48:25.60 Some people make the connection over here.
01:48:25.60 --> 01:48:26.60 Some people make the connection over there.
01:48:26.60 --> 01:48:28.60 And it's,
01:48:28.60 --> 01:48:33.60 but in a, in a period of an hour and a half training session,
01:48:33.60 --> 01:48:35.60 you can definitely see people.
01:48:35.60 --> 01:48:39.60 You'll see 25% of the people make a real connection.
01:48:39.60 --> 01:48:46.60 And the connection is between knowing and not knowing.
01:48:46.60 --> 01:48:51.60 Between between not knowing what this thing is
01:48:51.60 --> 01:48:57.60 and how expansive it is and knowing what this thing is and how expansive it is.
01:48:57.60 --> 01:49:00.60 And how it is so powerful.
01:49:00.60 --> 01:49:02.60 I think that's the difference.
01:49:02.60 --> 01:49:06.60 When somebody goes, oh, like I did it yesterday,
01:49:06.60 --> 01:49:10.60 I was teaching just the mownesscape and I was teaching the mownesscape
01:49:10.60 --> 01:49:14.60 with firstly, oompa, right?
01:49:14.60 --> 01:49:17.60 And then going to elbow escape.
01:49:17.60 --> 01:49:22.60 And as I explained, I was looking at this one girl and as I explained,
01:49:22.60 --> 01:49:26.60 that as I tried to oompa them over and the person moves at the moment,
01:49:26.60 --> 01:49:29.60 and the person moves out their leg to stop from being flipped over.
01:49:29.60 --> 01:49:31.60 And I said, freeze.
01:49:31.60 --> 01:49:33.60 And it's now look at his leg.
01:49:33.60 --> 01:49:38.60 And I said, that's what I wanted and I slipped my leg out and put him in half card.
01:49:38.60 --> 01:49:42.60 And I looked at her eyes and it was like, oh, yeah.
01:49:42.60 --> 01:49:44.60 And her eyes got big.
01:49:44.60 --> 01:49:46.60 And I was like, I looked at you and everyone's looking at you.
01:49:46.60 --> 01:49:47.60 Look at her.
01:49:47.60 --> 01:49:48.60 Yeah.
01:49:48.60 --> 01:49:49.60 She gets it.
01:49:49.60 --> 01:49:51.60 Because that's when you realize it.
01:49:51.60 --> 01:49:52.60 And then you realize that all this stuff,
01:49:52.60 --> 01:49:54.60 every move that you've seen over three days,
01:49:54.60 --> 01:49:55.60 it's all connected.
01:49:55.60 --> 01:49:57.60 It all makes sense.
01:49:57.60 --> 01:50:00.60 And it's all, it's all into woven with each other
01:50:00.60 --> 01:50:03.60 into this fabric that creates this thing.
01:50:03.60 --> 01:50:05.60 You looked at me yesterday and you're like, hey, get me in
01:50:05.60 --> 01:50:07.60 a quarter guard and I'm like, what's quarter guard?
01:50:07.60 --> 01:50:10.60 Oh, you actually like, if you put a foot in whatever.
01:50:10.60 --> 01:50:12.60 I didn't know, I didn't actually know it was a,
01:50:12.60 --> 01:50:16.60 I just thought was like, I was the stop was that was me trying to mount you
01:50:16.60 --> 01:50:18.60 or pass the guard.
01:50:18.60 --> 01:50:21.60 But you showed the one, you're like, I go to D-Path.
01:50:21.60 --> 01:50:22.60 And I was like, I go to D-Path from here.
01:50:22.60 --> 01:50:24.60 That's what I like to do.
01:50:24.60 --> 01:50:26.60 And you're like, well, let me show the move because you're moved to
01:50:26.60 --> 01:50:27.60 complex.
01:50:27.60 --> 01:50:29.60 I was like, yeah, they're failing at it right now.
01:50:29.60 --> 01:50:33.60 And so you kind of took the control of that session.
01:50:33.60 --> 01:50:37.60 And you did this move where how you got to D-Path.
01:50:37.60 --> 01:50:39.60 And I was like, thinking to myself, I like that.
01:50:39.60 --> 01:50:40.60 And I had one of those.
01:50:40.60 --> 01:50:41.60 No.
01:50:41.60 --> 01:50:44.60 And I was like, oh, stop.
01:50:44.60 --> 01:50:47.60 Because you use the same clamp hip rotation.
01:50:47.60 --> 01:50:49.60 I used for like one of my special sweeps.
01:50:49.60 --> 01:50:51.60 And I, and I didn't, and never registered.
01:50:51.60 --> 01:50:53.60 And I was like, that first thing I'm teaching like a pack
01:50:53.60 --> 01:50:54.60 is that right there.
01:50:54.60 --> 01:50:55.60 That's Jeff Glover.
01:50:55.60 --> 01:50:58.60 That's off Jeff Glover was the head,
01:50:58.60 --> 01:51:02.60 G-Jitsu instructor with Dean at my gym for four years.
01:51:02.60 --> 01:51:04.60 So we do a lot of deep half guard.
01:51:04.60 --> 01:51:05.60 Not enough.
01:51:05.60 --> 01:51:06.60 I need more.
01:51:06.60 --> 01:51:08.60 But he had some great setups there.
01:51:08.60 --> 01:51:12.60 You know, and what do you seen right now moves?
01:51:12.60 --> 01:51:15.60 Well, at camp one, what did everyone want to learn?
01:51:15.60 --> 01:51:19.60 Well, first of all, camp one was a bloodbath.
01:51:19.60 --> 01:51:22.60 Not really a bloodbath that was just came up here to beat each other.
01:51:22.60 --> 01:51:27.60 Yeah, we, over camp one was, first of all, I had what belt were you in?
01:51:27.60 --> 01:51:28.60 Camp one.
01:51:28.60 --> 01:51:33.60 I think I was a fresh black belt.
01:51:33.60 --> 01:51:36.60 I think I had, I think I just got it.
01:51:36.60 --> 01:51:37.60 Yeah.
01:51:37.60 --> 01:51:39.60 Because it was 2012.
01:51:39.60 --> 01:51:41.60 I had just gotten back from Abu Dhabi.
01:51:41.60 --> 01:51:44.60 And I was on top of my game.
01:51:44.60 --> 01:51:47.60 And we had like a tanky, you know, you know,
01:51:47.60 --> 01:51:48.60 Augustine, that was up here.
01:51:48.60 --> 01:51:53.60 Or I fell from Eagle Barboa, so then the main crew to deck one and
01:51:53.60 --> 01:51:55.60 Mackenzie Derners up here.
01:51:55.60 --> 01:52:00.60 And so that that first a year.
01:52:00.60 --> 01:52:02.60 We were just being up on each other.
01:52:02.60 --> 01:52:06.60 This came up here to basically trade everyone's competing and whatnot.
01:52:06.60 --> 01:52:07.60 Yeah.
01:52:07.60 --> 01:52:12.60 And what had happened is is we had launched like,
01:52:12.60 --> 01:52:14.60 K, we're bringing these experts.
01:52:14.60 --> 01:52:17.60 But we had launched that after we had, you know, started to have the
01:52:17.60 --> 01:52:19.60 registration right in for a while.
01:52:19.60 --> 01:52:22.60 And what we saw that first year was we didn't pick up a lot of
01:52:22.60 --> 01:52:25.60 extra people by having the experts.
01:52:25.60 --> 01:52:26.60 Right.
01:52:26.60 --> 01:52:32.60 And so people came and then we did the second year as a lot like the first
01:52:32.60 --> 01:52:34.60 year, except there was more people.
01:52:34.60 --> 01:52:38.60 And what we came to find out is that people were looking for
01:52:38.60 --> 01:52:40.60 an experience, right?
01:52:40.60 --> 01:52:43.60 Everyone's looking for something.
01:52:43.60 --> 01:52:48.60 And the way that we loved you, Jitsu and how it's affected our lives.
01:52:48.60 --> 01:52:51.60 It's almost like if you inject that with something extra.
01:52:51.60 --> 01:52:53.60 That's what campus.
01:52:53.60 --> 01:52:55.60 So Dean pointed this out to me.
01:52:55.60 --> 01:52:56.60 He's up here right now.
01:52:56.60 --> 01:52:57.60 Dean Lister.
01:52:57.60 --> 01:53:02.60 Dean pointed out to me that in Europe, he says adults do camps.
01:53:02.60 --> 01:53:05.60 Big they go to camp in America.
01:53:05.60 --> 01:53:07.60 Kids go to camp.
01:53:07.60 --> 01:53:09.60 And that makes sense, right?
01:53:09.60 --> 01:53:12.60 I said, I'm never even dreamt of going into a camp.
01:53:12.60 --> 01:53:13.60 A camp.
01:53:13.60 --> 01:53:15.60 And every even dream as an adult, are you kidding me?
01:53:15.60 --> 01:53:17.60 I never thought about that.
01:53:17.60 --> 01:53:20.60 But in Europe, apparently, hey, it's totally normal to say, hey, you're going to go to this
01:53:20.60 --> 01:53:22.60 rock climbing camp or you're an adult.
01:53:22.60 --> 01:53:23.60 You're a grown person.
01:53:23.60 --> 01:53:26.60 You're going to go to a gymnastics or a yoga camp or something like that.
01:53:26.60 --> 01:53:29.60 Or you're going to go to a tennis camp as an adult.
01:53:29.60 --> 01:53:31.60 In America, we don't do that.
01:53:31.60 --> 01:53:32.60 No, we do now.
01:53:32.60 --> 01:53:33.60 Yeah, we do.
01:53:33.60 --> 01:53:34.60 You just do camp.
01:53:34.60 --> 01:53:36.60 I'm going to get something.
01:53:36.60 --> 01:53:38.60 And you know, echo when I were talking the other day.
01:53:38.60 --> 01:53:40.60 And I think this is a great premise.
01:53:40.60 --> 01:53:45.60 And I don't want this to sound crazy, right?
01:53:45.60 --> 01:53:56.60 But imagine if the goal of the camp is to increase your skill level one belt.
01:53:56.60 --> 01:54:00.60 That's actually a very good reality.
01:54:00.60 --> 01:54:03.60 So it's not, it might not be realistic, right?
01:54:03.60 --> 01:54:04.60 You're not going to go.
01:54:04.60 --> 01:54:06.60 You're not going to gain that much skill.
01:54:06.60 --> 01:54:08.60 But let me break it down.
01:54:08.60 --> 01:54:11.60 Okay, your initial thought is like, no way could that happen, right?
01:54:11.60 --> 01:54:12.60 You can't get that much better.
01:54:12.60 --> 01:54:13.60 I sure pretty good.
01:54:13.60 --> 01:54:15.60 But now I want you to think about something.
01:54:15.60 --> 01:54:21.60 You train, if you come here and you train for six hours a day for seven days.
01:54:21.60 --> 01:54:23.60 What do you got 42 hours?
01:54:23.60 --> 01:54:25.60 You take that.
01:54:25.60 --> 01:54:29.60 That's two or three months worth of training.
01:54:29.60 --> 01:54:30.60 But think about this.
01:54:30.60 --> 01:54:32.60 How often when you go to training?
01:54:32.60 --> 01:54:34.60 Are you learning a move that you already knew?
01:54:34.60 --> 01:54:39.60 Often. How often you're going to training? You're learning to move that really doesn't fit your style.
01:54:39.60 --> 01:54:40.60 Often.
01:54:40.60 --> 01:54:48.60 What if you came to a place where you were just going to learn the moves that you needed to improve your skill level that much?
01:54:48.60 --> 01:54:53.60 Now, I think we're close. I mean, that you're going to walk out of this camp as is right now.
01:54:53.60 --> 01:54:55.60 Just way better, way better.
01:54:55.60 --> 01:55:03.60 I was thinking about a one time I taught a group of seals five straight days, eight hours a day.
01:55:03.60 --> 01:55:05.60 For for Getsu.
01:55:05.60 --> 01:55:08.60 I called it. I named it.
01:55:08.60 --> 01:55:09.60 I named the course.
01:55:09.60 --> 01:55:12.60 What? It was called Jaco.
01:55:12.60 --> 01:55:17.60 J. A. Period O. Period C. Period K. Period O.
01:55:17.60 --> 01:55:20.60 And it was it stood for.
01:55:20.60 --> 01:55:25.60 Do you get to offense for combat killing operations?
01:55:25.60 --> 01:55:29.60 Can't take for Getsu.
01:55:29.60 --> 01:55:33.60 I was like, I don't know.
01:55:33.60 --> 01:55:34.60 I was young.
01:55:34.60 --> 01:55:36.60 I was 25.
01:55:36.60 --> 01:55:43.60 But anyways, so what I noticed is that when I was teaching Jaco offense for combat killing operations,
01:55:43.60 --> 01:55:49.60 when I was teaching that course of instruction, even though I was training guys that had never trained,
01:55:49.60 --> 01:55:51.60 and I was a blue belt at the time.
01:55:51.60 --> 01:55:54.60 But even though I was training guys that had never trained before,
01:55:54.60 --> 01:55:58.60 I was still going to Fabio's my teacher at night.
01:55:58.60 --> 01:56:03.60 And every day I got like better every day I got better.
01:56:03.60 --> 01:56:06.60 And I thought to myself, oh wow, there's something to this.
01:56:06.60 --> 01:56:10.60 And that's why when I would do deployments with no guys to train with,
01:56:10.60 --> 01:56:12.60 I would just have my guys come in train with me.
01:56:12.60 --> 01:56:15.60 You know, like, hey, you come from 12 to 12, 15, and you come from 12 to 12,
01:56:15.60 --> 01:56:18.60 for change to 12, 30, and I just roll with every guy in the cartoon,
01:56:18.60 --> 01:56:20.60 and just to get the mat time.
01:56:20.60 --> 01:56:22.60 Because that mat time is going to help you.
01:56:22.60 --> 01:56:24.60 But then if you imagine this, you take what we're doing here.
01:56:24.60 --> 01:56:30.60 You have specific instruction instructors that are good at different little parts of the game.
01:56:30.60 --> 01:56:34.60 And you go, oh, Alexa, can you help me with my daily life?
01:56:34.60 --> 01:56:40.60 I'm going to spend the next four hours getting not a private, but a private basically.
01:56:40.60 --> 01:56:43.60 Basically, from Alexa, oh, Dean Lister's here,
01:56:43.60 --> 01:56:49.60 A Dean, can you show me how to finish this key look in these different positions?
01:56:49.60 --> 01:56:50.60 You know what I mean?
01:56:50.60 --> 01:56:54.60 Like, you could go, uh, the deco, can you look?
01:56:54.60 --> 01:56:57.60 I want to, I want to sweep from butterfly guard.
01:56:57.60 --> 01:56:59.60 Can you, your master at this?
01:56:59.60 --> 01:57:02.60 Can you, perfect my game in that area?
01:57:02.60 --> 01:57:05.60 And I think if you carved it up right,
01:57:05.60 --> 01:57:08.60 you could look, are you going to get a new belt level?
01:57:08.60 --> 01:57:11.60 No, but if you make that your goal to get in here and fill holes,
01:57:11.60 --> 01:57:14.60 you're going to walk out of here with massive amounts of improvement.
01:57:14.60 --> 01:57:15.60 You know what's incredible?
01:57:15.60 --> 01:57:17.60 And that's the immersion part of it?
01:57:17.60 --> 01:57:18.60 Like, it's immersion.
01:57:18.60 --> 01:57:22.60 You know, people are very nervous about not so much anymore,
01:57:22.60 --> 01:57:26.60 but I still get a lot of emails like, is it right for me?
01:57:26.60 --> 01:57:29.60 And it's, well, we're all adults first of all.
01:57:29.60 --> 01:57:34.60 So it's, there's sessions and there's opportunity outside those sessions,
01:57:34.60 --> 01:57:37.60 but everyone's here for the same purpose.
01:57:37.60 --> 01:57:39.60 And like I said, hey, no one's going to win a camp trophy, right?
01:57:39.60 --> 01:57:44.60 It's not what's all about it is full on immersion of Jiu-Jitsu,
01:57:44.60 --> 01:57:46.60 from some of the world's best.
01:57:46.60 --> 01:57:51.60 But we've had people come to camp as a new blue belt.
01:57:51.60 --> 01:57:54.60 They're now black belts. They still come to camp.
01:57:54.60 --> 01:57:57.60 Yeah. Usually when you hit purple belt,
01:57:57.60 --> 01:57:59.60 you get a bit of ego.
01:57:59.60 --> 01:58:02.60 When you hit brown belt, you're basically a black belt.
01:58:02.60 --> 01:58:05.60 And when you hit black belt, you think you should be sponsored.
01:58:05.60 --> 01:58:10.60 That's how it goes in Jiu-Jitsu.
01:58:10.60 --> 01:58:14.60 That's probably out here on the West Coast and San Diego.
01:58:14.60 --> 01:58:17.60 Yeah. Like, yeah, you're not thinking that.
01:58:17.60 --> 01:58:18.60 Okay.
01:58:18.60 --> 01:58:19.60 You're kidding.
01:58:19.60 --> 01:58:20.60 Those two are black belts.
01:58:20.60 --> 01:58:22.60 Did you see all the black belts and brown belts out there?
01:58:22.60 --> 01:58:23.60 That register for camp?
01:58:23.60 --> 01:58:25.60 Oh yeah. Yeah. It's crazy.
01:58:25.60 --> 01:58:26.60 It's crazy.
01:58:26.60 --> 01:58:29.60 So it is, it's like a full immersion for all levels,
01:58:29.60 --> 01:58:35.60 which it's incredible to be able to bring all the levels to camp.
01:58:35.60 --> 01:58:37.60 Okay. Now this needs to be said.
01:58:37.60 --> 01:58:42.60 It's also in what we would call in the military, a gentleman's course.
01:58:42.60 --> 01:58:43.60 Yes.
01:58:43.60 --> 01:58:45.60 Did you do the civilians know what that means?
01:58:45.60 --> 01:58:46.60 Uh-huh.
01:58:46.60 --> 01:58:54.60 The difference. Okay. In the military, a normal course of instruction means you're going to go and you're going to be basically treated like crap.
01:58:54.60 --> 01:58:56.60 And you're going to do crappy things.
01:58:56.60 --> 01:58:59.60 And it's like, hey, we're going to make you understand this.
01:58:59.60 --> 01:59:02.60 A gentleman's course, like, okay, look, we're going to get the material covered.
01:59:02.60 --> 01:59:04.60 You're going to get treated like the grown man.
01:59:04.60 --> 01:59:06.60 Or in this case, growing woman.
01:59:06.60 --> 01:59:08.60 You're not going to be treated like a child.
01:59:08.60 --> 01:59:10.60 So that, so this place is a gentleman's course.
01:59:10.60 --> 01:59:14.60 It's not like, hey, you will be, if you want to skip a session here,
01:59:14.60 --> 01:59:15.60 skip a session.
01:59:15.60 --> 01:59:17.60 You don't want to do take down.
01:59:17.60 --> 01:59:19.60 Oh, don't do take down.
01:59:19.60 --> 01:59:22.60 You don't, you want to relax in the morning and don't want to do the morning session.
01:59:22.60 --> 01:59:26.60 Or you want to stay up on the mat all night and get on vampire hours.
01:59:26.60 --> 01:59:27.60 Get something.
01:59:27.60 --> 01:59:28.60 I got on vampire hours.
01:59:28.60 --> 01:59:29.60 That's, yeah, I know two way.
01:59:29.60 --> 01:59:30.60 Yeah, every morning.
01:59:30.60 --> 01:59:32.60 So, so it's a gentleman's course.
01:59:32.60 --> 01:59:36.60 And, and you can come here and you can pick and choose what you want to do.
01:59:36.60 --> 01:59:38.60 If you, there's people here that I thought this was cool.
01:59:38.60 --> 01:59:42.60 People here that are injured that cannot roll, but they're here.
01:59:42.60 --> 01:59:44.60 And they're learning moves and they're drilling as much as they can.
01:59:44.60 --> 01:59:48.60 And then cool, they're going to go home and use them live when they can use them live.
01:59:48.60 --> 01:59:52.60 So that parts, that parts pretty cool.
01:59:52.60 --> 01:59:55.60 Uh, one, I want to go, I hate to drag you back this, but move.
01:59:55.60 --> 01:59:59.60 Do you remember moves like from seven years ago that people were looking at.
01:59:59.60 --> 02:00:01.60 Compared to now.
02:00:01.60 --> 02:00:05.60 Any, anything, does anything jump out of you or am I just talking up on their own trick?
02:00:05.60 --> 02:00:06.60 No, totally.
02:00:06.60 --> 02:00:10.60 Totally. I mean, I remember standing there.
02:00:10.60 --> 02:00:13.60 I remember sitting in the stands watching,
02:00:13.60 --> 02:00:17.60 Hodger Gracie choke everybody out from Mount.
02:00:17.60 --> 02:00:22.60 Every single person in the pyramid at the World Championships.
02:00:22.60 --> 02:00:26.60 And thinking that's, and I was young, young, you know,
02:00:26.60 --> 02:00:28.60 belt and I'm thinking like, all that's real, Gigiitsu.
02:00:28.60 --> 02:00:33.60 Then I remember the men, des brothers, barren, bow-loing, everybody.
02:00:33.60 --> 02:00:35.60 And then thinking like, well, maybe that's Gigiitsu.
02:00:35.60 --> 02:00:40.60 You know, but as you progress, you come to find out it's all Gigiitsu and it's all cyclical.
02:00:40.60 --> 02:00:41.60 And that's the bottom line.
02:00:41.60 --> 02:00:47.60 There's a cycle of Gigiitsu and things, you know, your body can only do certain things.
02:00:47.60 --> 02:00:50.60 Right? You can only, you can't bend your elbow backwards.
02:00:50.60 --> 02:00:52.60 You know, there's, you have some resilience.
02:00:52.60 --> 02:00:58.60 You build up some resilience to different things, but it's a, it's the cyclical thing.
02:00:58.60 --> 02:01:04.60 And I've seen things that came and then were defended and then changed.
02:01:04.60 --> 02:01:08.60 Like the daily he would guard.
02:01:08.60 --> 02:01:10.60 I love the daily he would guard.
02:01:10.60 --> 02:01:15.60 And it's coming back, you know.
02:01:15.60 --> 02:01:19.60 And, and, and it's the first time the first time I've seen it come back is when that,
02:01:19.60 --> 02:01:24.60 that new kid swept Bouchesha with a straight up daily he was sweet.
02:01:24.60 --> 02:01:27.60 Who's that kid that's coming on the scene hardcore now?
02:01:27.60 --> 02:01:28.60 Oh, right.
02:01:28.60 --> 02:01:31.60 Um, man, grab Marigali, Marigali.
02:01:31.60 --> 02:01:39.60 Yeah. But as far as moves for me, I always stick to the basics like, you know,
02:01:39.60 --> 02:01:44.60 make them skate on ice when you're on bottom and put them under the ice when you're on top.
02:01:44.60 --> 02:01:46.60 And I just try to stick to those two things and, you know,
02:01:46.60 --> 02:01:49.60 moves come or go, but, you know, the concepts stay the same.
02:01:49.60 --> 02:01:54.60 They don't ever change concepts and just do conceptually nothing ever changes.
02:01:54.60 --> 02:01:55.60 You're trying to do something.
02:01:55.60 --> 02:01:56.60 Yeah.
02:01:56.60 --> 02:01:57.60 It's like the laws of combat.
02:01:57.60 --> 02:01:58.60 Okay.
02:01:58.60 --> 02:02:01.60 The concepts don't change. Covered moves cover and move.
02:02:01.60 --> 02:02:04.60 Big and it's off balancing someone.
02:02:04.60 --> 02:02:04.60 Yeah.
02:02:04.60 --> 02:02:05.60 Putting them off balance.
02:02:05.60 --> 02:02:06.60 Right.
02:02:06.60 --> 02:02:12.60 What when you see different people teach what type of instruction do you think works best for you personally,
02:02:12.60 --> 02:02:13.60 Pete Roberts?
02:02:13.60 --> 02:02:17.60 For me, I want clear concise.
02:02:17.60 --> 02:02:21.60 Uh, just straightforward show me once.
02:02:21.60 --> 02:02:25.60 Do you like to see the move?
02:02:25.60 --> 02:02:31.60 Like like individual moves or do you like to understand the broader concept?
02:02:31.60 --> 02:02:33.60 I'm a concept guy.
02:02:33.60 --> 02:02:34.60 I'm serious.
02:02:34.60 --> 02:02:36.60 Because my artsy artsy, very mind.
02:02:36.60 --> 02:02:38.60 But I like the concepts of it.
02:02:38.60 --> 02:02:39.60 Yeah.
02:02:39.60 --> 02:02:40.60 And it's weird.
02:02:40.60 --> 02:02:44.60 And that's one thing that's good about this is you have some of the instructors teach.
02:02:44.60 --> 02:02:48.60 Here's the, here's move one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
02:02:48.60 --> 02:02:50.60 That's the move.
02:02:50.60 --> 02:02:52.60 You do these seven things.
02:02:52.60 --> 02:02:53.60 That's the move.
02:02:53.60 --> 02:02:57.60 Other teachers here are like, here's what you're trying to do first.
02:02:57.60 --> 02:02:59.60 There's what you're trying to do second.
02:02:59.60 --> 02:03:01.60 Here's what you're trying to do third.
02:03:01.60 --> 02:03:02.60 It's probably going to cause this to happen.
02:03:02.60 --> 02:03:04.60 And when that happens, here's what you're going to do with it.
02:03:04.60 --> 02:03:05.60 It's a linear system.
02:03:05.60 --> 02:03:07.60 And I look at the jutsu non-linear.
02:03:07.60 --> 02:03:08.60 Yeah.
02:03:08.60 --> 02:03:11.60 But it's okay to look at linear two because some people that's their learning skills,
02:03:11.60 --> 02:03:12.60 I'm saying that.
02:03:12.60 --> 02:03:14.60 That's why I'm saying this is some people.
02:03:14.60 --> 02:03:17.60 I give them the concept and then they say, because I'm a,
02:03:17.60 --> 02:03:19.60 I'm a conceptual teacher.
02:03:19.60 --> 02:03:20.60 Yeah.
02:03:20.60 --> 02:03:22.60 I give them the concept and they say, okay, where do I grab?
02:03:22.60 --> 02:03:23.60 Exactly.
02:03:23.60 --> 02:03:24.60 Exactly.
02:03:24.60 --> 02:03:27.60 And as soon as they asked me that, I realized, I say, okay, grab here.
02:03:27.60 --> 02:03:28.60 Mm-hmm.
02:03:28.60 --> 02:03:31.60 Other hand here, foot here.
02:03:31.60 --> 02:03:33.60 Push, pull, lean.
02:03:33.60 --> 02:03:34.60 There it is.
02:03:34.60 --> 02:03:36.60 That's why I'm a shitty teacher.
02:03:36.60 --> 02:03:37.60 Mm-hmm.
02:03:37.60 --> 02:03:42.60 Well, you're only a shitty teacher to people that aren't that don't learn the way you do.
02:03:42.60 --> 02:03:43.60 Exactly.
02:03:43.60 --> 02:03:44.60 Exactly.
02:03:44.60 --> 02:03:47.60 So, like that, I think that's good to have people.
02:03:47.60 --> 02:03:50.60 I mean, how long you've been training for?
02:03:50.60 --> 02:03:52.60 Uh, 2006.
02:03:52.60 --> 02:03:53.60 I started.
02:03:53.60 --> 02:03:55.60 So, 12, 12 years.
02:03:55.60 --> 02:03:56.60 12 years.
02:03:56.60 --> 02:04:03.60 You've been training 12 years and I showed a move that you were a black belt when I was, you know,
02:04:03.60 --> 02:04:05.60 in diapers and jiu-jitsu.
02:04:05.60 --> 02:04:10.60 So, I showed a move that you didn't see in 12 years, right?
02:04:10.60 --> 02:04:11.60 You showed a move.
02:04:11.60 --> 02:04:16.60 I've been training for a long, longer, 20, something years.
02:04:16.60 --> 02:04:17.60 And you showed move.
02:04:17.60 --> 02:04:18.60 I didn't.
02:04:18.60 --> 02:04:19.60 Never seen before.
02:04:19.60 --> 02:04:22.60 Is that mean I need to expose myself to more?
02:04:22.60 --> 02:04:23.60 Yes.
02:04:23.60 --> 02:04:24.60 But it also means, guess what?
02:04:24.60 --> 02:04:25.60 There's only so much knowledge.
02:04:25.60 --> 02:04:30.60 And what's cool about this is the moves get filtered by human beings, right?
02:04:30.60 --> 02:04:35.60 You're not out there teaching a move that you haven't used and don't feel good about.
02:04:35.60 --> 02:04:41.60 Whereas, there could be moves that you can learn like all that person's never actually used that move before.
02:04:41.60 --> 02:04:42.60 Mm-hmm.
02:04:42.60 --> 02:04:44.60 So, things to be interested.
02:04:44.60 --> 02:04:48.60 You know, you talked about immersion and an explain this to everyone.
02:04:48.60 --> 02:04:49.60 I don't know if I've ever heard.
02:04:49.60 --> 02:04:53.60 Have I ever done a language-comparative language to on this podcast?
02:04:53.60 --> 02:04:55.60 Oh, on this podcast, I don't know.
02:04:55.60 --> 02:04:56.60 Okay.
02:04:56.60 --> 02:04:57.60 I don't know either.
02:04:57.60 --> 02:05:03.60 For people that want to learn jiu-jitsu, this is an immersion camp, but no matter where you're learning it.
02:05:03.60 --> 02:05:04.60 This is great.
02:05:04.60 --> 02:05:05.60 I know what you're going to say.
02:05:05.60 --> 02:05:06.60 That's the language thing.
02:05:06.60 --> 02:05:08.60 I really got me when you said this.
02:05:08.60 --> 02:05:09.60 Okay.
02:05:09.60 --> 02:05:12.60 So, here's what it is to learn jiu-jitsu.
02:05:12.60 --> 02:05:14.60 You know, I compares to learning a language.
02:05:14.60 --> 02:05:17.60 I was an English major.
02:05:17.60 --> 02:05:23.60 So, and I studied linguistics inside of studying English.
02:05:23.60 --> 02:05:26.60 Learning a language and learning jiu-jitsu are very similar.
02:05:26.60 --> 02:05:33.60 When you, so when echo, who echo gives a great introductory course to jiu-jitsu, it's like what you teach?
02:05:33.60 --> 02:05:35.60 Mount, you teach all the positions.
02:05:35.60 --> 02:05:39.60 Mount, back, half-guard, guard, sign-mo.
02:05:39.60 --> 02:05:40.60 Side control.
02:05:40.60 --> 02:05:43.60 And you teach a little bit of action from each one.
02:05:43.60 --> 02:05:45.60 Maybe one or two submissions from one or two.
02:05:45.60 --> 02:05:47.60 One or two escapes from one or two.
02:05:47.60 --> 02:05:52.60 So, it's a total of five positions and seven moves.
02:05:52.60 --> 02:05:54.60 Let's say something like that.
02:05:54.60 --> 02:06:00.60 When he gets done teaching that introduction, and it's actually the same introduction that I basically teach.
02:06:00.60 --> 02:06:04.60 And when I've taught it, the master of the zoo, when I first said this, so at the master, I said,
02:06:04.60 --> 02:06:07.60 when we got done with this hour and a half, and they're all these people are all fired up,
02:06:07.60 --> 02:06:09.60 because they know how to do the Americana.
02:06:09.60 --> 02:06:11.60 They know how to do the re-arrunaked choke.
02:06:11.60 --> 02:06:15.60 And they're basically in their minds trained killers.
02:06:15.60 --> 02:06:17.60 I guess probably, you know, absolutely.
02:06:17.60 --> 02:06:28.60 And when we get done with that, I say, okay, you have just learned the one line that forms the small letter A that goes down the side.
02:06:28.60 --> 02:06:29.60 You only learn that.
02:06:29.60 --> 02:06:32.60 You haven't even actually learned the letter A yet.
02:06:32.60 --> 02:06:33.60 Exactly.
02:06:33.60 --> 02:06:36.60 In terms of looking at his language, you train for another few hours.
02:06:36.60 --> 02:06:38.60 You might have an A, right?
02:06:38.60 --> 02:06:41.60 And then you, then, okay, now, but can you speak a sentence?
02:06:41.60 --> 02:06:42.60 Nope.
02:06:42.60 --> 02:06:43.60 You can't even form a word yet.
02:06:43.60 --> 02:06:44.60 There's one word you can form.
02:06:44.60 --> 02:06:45.60 It's A.
02:06:45.60 --> 02:06:47.60 You got one word.
02:06:47.60 --> 02:06:48.60 That's basically where you're at.
02:06:48.60 --> 02:06:52.60 So what you need to do is you need to learn more moves.
02:06:52.60 --> 02:06:56.60 But once you learn different, you couldn't just learn letters, you need to learn how to spell.
02:06:56.60 --> 02:06:58.60 That's how you put the move moves together.
02:06:58.60 --> 02:07:04.60 And then you got to learn how to fit those moves together in, against and alongside other moves.
02:07:04.60 --> 02:07:06.60 That's a sentence.
02:07:06.60 --> 02:07:10.60 And then you got to figure out how you're going to roll through a paragraph.
02:07:10.60 --> 02:07:13.60 And then you put in these moves together.
02:07:13.60 --> 02:07:16.60 Then you realize that it's also like language.
02:07:16.60 --> 02:07:17.60 It's like the bait.
02:07:17.60 --> 02:07:21.60 You're actually somebody's throwing other words that you and you need to learn how to respond to.
02:07:21.60 --> 02:07:25.60 And once you learn all those words and you learn how to put them in a paragraph.
02:07:25.60 --> 02:07:26.60 And you get to end of that.
02:07:26.60 --> 02:07:28.60 And you think you've mastered the language.
02:07:28.60 --> 02:07:30.60 Then someone says, hey, guess what?
02:07:30.60 --> 02:07:32.60 You've got to learn German.
02:07:32.60 --> 02:07:33.60 Yeah.
02:07:33.60 --> 02:07:35.60 Which is, you know, judo.
02:07:35.60 --> 02:07:37.60 And then you got to learn sombo, which is Russian.
02:07:37.60 --> 02:07:39.60 And you got to learn all these different languages.
02:07:39.60 --> 02:07:43.60 You got to learn all these different languages in order to really truly understand.
02:07:43.60 --> 02:07:46.60 And I feel like I feel like black belt for me.
02:07:46.60 --> 02:07:52.60 Like getting to black belt was the start of that was like okay, the English language.
02:07:52.60 --> 02:07:56.60 But I felt my grammar still sucks.
02:07:56.60 --> 02:07:59.60 Yeah, I feel like we're going to get to those other languages yet.
02:07:59.60 --> 02:08:04.60 I feel like from the language perspective, when you get your black belt, you have the language capability of like a ten.
02:08:04.60 --> 02:08:07.60 You're not going to be able to just pick up a book and start reading it.
02:08:07.60 --> 02:08:09.60 You're not going to be able to do that.
02:08:09.60 --> 02:08:12.60 You have to be, you know, one of these guys that has been training and teaching for a really long time and competing is.
02:08:12.60 --> 02:08:15.60 And though, and really have like a broad mind.
02:08:15.60 --> 02:08:19.60 And you know what's crazy is I, you know what, we got the plastic forks in the comments.
02:08:19.60 --> 02:08:21.60 Someone has asked me what the stripes mean.
02:08:21.60 --> 02:08:25.60 And so I took out the plastic forks and I had lined them up.
02:08:25.60 --> 02:08:26.60 And I was like, what do you think?
02:08:26.60 --> 02:08:27.60 I'm going to be able to do that.
02:08:27.60 --> 02:08:28.60 And I'm going to be able to do that.
02:08:28.60 --> 02:08:29.60 And I'm going to be able to do that.
02:08:29.60 --> 02:08:30.60 And I'm going to be able to do that.
02:08:30.60 --> 02:08:34.60 And I just drive's mean. And so I took out the plastic forks and I lined them up.
02:08:34.60 --> 02:08:36.60 I said that's three years of black belt.
02:08:36.60 --> 02:08:38.60 That's three years of black belt first too.
02:08:38.60 --> 02:08:40.60 The next one, that's five years, that's five years.
02:08:40.60 --> 02:08:42.60 That's seven years and that's seven.
02:08:42.60 --> 02:08:44.60 I said, so when you look at someone,
02:08:44.60 --> 02:08:46.60 you can see how long they've been a black belt.
02:08:46.60 --> 02:08:50.60 Because their question was, are there differences in black belts?
02:08:50.60 --> 02:08:53.60 Absolutely, there's differences.
02:08:53.60 --> 02:08:57.60 Most of these guys have been black belts in World Champion.
02:08:57.60 --> 02:09:04.88 champion and have a hundred black belts when I just started training GJ2. So go to them.
02:09:04.88 --> 02:09:10.72 They've got the knowledge. I'm still trying to learn that. Yeah. Yeah. For sure. And there are,
02:09:10.72 --> 02:09:17.12 I mean, there's as much disparity in black belts as there are from white to brown belt. Yeah.
02:09:17.12 --> 02:09:25.44 There's, there's that much difference. Absolutely. All right. Cool. I think I think that's a good place
02:09:25.44 --> 02:09:35.60 to wrap it. Wrap it. Um, speaking of wrapping up. Echo Charles. Yes. You didn't even jump into that.
02:09:35.60 --> 02:09:40.88 You did through conversation very much. You guys are nailing it on the head every single time. No,
02:09:40.88 --> 02:09:47.52 like, I mean, I had every single time. And it's like not every single time. I would just say every time.
02:09:47.52 --> 02:09:51.12 I got it, you know, in the spirit of how much to work. How much torture. So for those of you
02:09:51.12 --> 02:09:57.84 don't know, Echo Charles has a, a, a, a call to broken wing. You would have a broken wing. We got that by
02:09:57.84 --> 02:10:06.08 covering injury recovering. How much torture was it to be here without rolling? It was like, um,
02:10:07.20 --> 02:10:12.88 like a broke. You know, when you torture someone, then they break. Oh, I broke. Yeah. The other day.
02:10:12.88 --> 02:10:18.96 So actually rolled two rounds. I didn't re-injure it or nothing like this, but
02:10:18.96 --> 02:10:24.16 you definitely felt it. I heard it just from all the twisting activity. So it's like,
02:10:24.16 --> 02:10:28.96 but I feel it is just one of those hurt things. It'll be fine. Absolutely fine. But yeah,
02:10:28.96 --> 02:10:34.16 tortures too. Or as far as the degree, whatever degree it takes to break. That's me.
02:10:34.16 --> 02:10:38.24 Let's definitely different. Different people. Yes, it is. So, uh, well,
02:10:39.12 --> 02:10:43.04 maybe we're not going to torture anyone, but if we want to help them instead of torture,
02:10:43.04 --> 02:10:49.12 yeah, maybe you could, you know, close and then how to do that. Demonstrable actually, what, illustrate. No,
02:10:49.12 --> 02:10:54.32 illustrate. No, illustrate is also explained. Yeah, like, you could paint a picture if you will. You
02:10:54.32 --> 02:10:59.12 can metaphor. All right. Let's do it. Okay. Let's talk about origin first. Like we always do that.
02:10:59.12 --> 02:11:05.60 By the way, it's awesome. Pete, since you're here, what do you think? What do I think? What do you think about
02:11:05.60 --> 02:11:11.68 origin? It is like, you know, you know anything about this or what? I know a little bit about it.
02:11:11.68 --> 02:11:17.52 Yeah. I've been involved for a little while. What do you want to talk about with origin? Okay.
02:11:17.52 --> 02:11:22.64 And the whole podcast is kind of like a stressful. Yeah. What we haven't done this before. Okay.
02:11:23.36 --> 02:11:27.76 New person hasn't trained your juts before. Need a key. What do you want you to get? Well,
02:11:27.76 --> 02:11:33.68 there's only one. To get one. What specific? That is, uh, never trained your juts to come.
02:11:33.68 --> 02:11:42.16 I'll get a, get a, uh, compethletic key. Okay. So, so there's levels of keys. We make a key here in the United
02:11:42.16 --> 02:11:49.92 States from American Girl and Cotton and you've heard echo said before. A key is a tool you need to
02:11:49.92 --> 02:11:55.84 start your journey. Most schools are going to require you to have one. Normally, if you start an
02:11:55.84 --> 02:12:00.48 MMA school, you're going to start with a rash guard and some shorts. But if you're going to go
02:12:00.48 --> 02:12:06.56 try jutsu and I would recommend, you know, trying it in the key first, you're going to need a key.
02:12:06.56 --> 02:12:13.36 And that right there is, is a tool you're going to use in your journey. It's not just something
02:12:13.36 --> 02:12:18.72 you wear and it's actually a tool. It's actually something you're going to grip and hold and turn
02:12:18.72 --> 02:12:24.88 and twist. And when you're doing that or when someone's doing that to you, you need the best tool.
02:12:24.88 --> 02:12:29.44 And that's what we make up here in Maine are the best tools for training. And the form of it just
02:12:29.44 --> 02:12:35.52 happens to be a key. So, someone's never trained before. Compa athletic, calm, athletic, calm, athletic.
02:12:35.52 --> 02:12:40.72 Calm, athletic. So, I did it in like portrait. I made it. The portrait is ATLAT. So, it's athletic.
02:12:40.72 --> 02:12:46.000 Right. You just said, I thought you said that. I say athletic. Okay. Because it means athlete. So,
02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:50.72 calm, athlete, calm, athletic. Yeah, that's that. Ortee. Yeah, it's a little little bit of top.
02:12:50.72 --> 02:12:55.92 Hey, but that's not like a hard and fast. Like, hey, if you're just beginning, you should get this.
02:12:55.92 --> 02:13:00.48 It's kind of, that's kind of like you're just recommendation. Right. Because I use it too.
02:13:00.48 --> 02:13:05.04 I use the athletic. I'm going to have an axiom too. I mean, the axiom is like next level.
02:13:05.04 --> 02:13:09.60 Like if you're serious about training, like you're going to commit to it, like you're really going to commit to it.
02:13:09.60 --> 02:13:13.52 You need to get an axiom. So, if you're compared to like a surfboard, right? I mean,
02:13:13.52 --> 02:13:18.80 I'm assuming you start surfing and you get the, you know, like you're watching or short. Remember that?
02:13:18.80 --> 02:13:21.12 This is a surfboard. You have watching or short?
02:13:21.12 --> 02:13:26.32 Yeah, okay. I have, but I haven't seen the long time. Okay. So, he wanted to ride.
02:13:26.32 --> 02:13:29.76 What's the board? He, I forget. You ever watched North Shore? No. Oh, dang too bad.
02:13:29.76 --> 02:13:35.12 Yeah. That's, that's cool. Anyway, so this kid, Rick Kane, for a, if they, if surfers,
02:13:35.12 --> 02:13:39.92 well, if any surfers listening, we'll be like, yeah, North Shore is cheesy. I get it. I know man.
02:13:39.92 --> 02:13:45.52 But you can't, the point. The point. The point. I'm not in the loop. It's okay. Welcome to Echo's podcast.
02:13:45.52 --> 02:13:52.000 You're not in the loop. Rick Kane wins a surfing competition in Arizona in the tank.
02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:55.60 Yeah. Go so wide because you're going to surf the big ways. You get this trainer old school,
02:13:55.60 --> 02:14:00.88 soul surfer type guy. Who plays that? Jerry Lopez. No, no. Jerry Lopez is Vince on the kind of
02:14:00.88 --> 02:14:06.72 the rival of the local. Anyway, that's a different point. So, he kind of at one point, this is
02:14:06.72 --> 02:14:11.36 a small kind of small part of the movie, but he wants to use this like special board that his trainer
02:14:11.36 --> 02:14:16.40 kind of shapes or or had or whatever. And he's like, right, you know, ready for that. Yeah. It's not like that,
02:14:16.40 --> 02:14:17.68 right? You seem to know. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
02:14:17.68 --> 02:14:23.44 like that. Because you could get an axiom day one. Yeah. We have people that do. Yeah. They'll listen to your podcast.
02:14:23.44 --> 02:14:28.08 No, but like I got started to do any the best. What? Yeah. Cool. That is the, the axioms
02:14:28.08 --> 02:14:33.92 comfortable as can be. But we read, we're reinventing the key again for next year. Yeah. Yeah. We
02:14:33.92 --> 02:14:38.32 are doing that well. No, I know we mentioned it. Yeah. But you do really good things like, um, like the
02:14:38.32 --> 02:14:42.96 pants, for example. Yeah. Like, you know a regular, I don't know regular, whatever. The different kind
02:14:42.96 --> 02:14:48.80 of key trash bags style pants versus you know mapping body mapping pants. Yeah. That's a big deal.
02:14:48.80 --> 02:14:53.60 Yes. That's really what set us apart initially. Yeah. I could see why it's really why we
02:14:54.24 --> 02:14:58.72 one of the reasons we decided to bring manufacturing back is because when every time we come
02:14:58.72 --> 02:15:02.96 up with something to get ripped off, our manufacturers send it over overseas and have to give it
02:15:02.96 --> 02:15:09.76 somebody else in the pants is a huge, huge thing for better training. Yeah. Holy. Also speaking
02:15:09.76 --> 02:15:15.04 of pants joggers. Okay. I don't know if I said this before. I told some guys earlier today or yes,
02:15:15.84 --> 02:15:18.88 you know joggers. I don't know if you remember this last year. You were like, oh yeah. And
02:15:18.88 --> 02:15:22.96 I hear some here's some joggers or whatever. I'll say you know, it's like joggers. You know,
02:15:22.96 --> 02:15:27.36 isn't that the slim fit? You know, and you're like, yeah, I saw like whatever, you know,
02:15:27.36 --> 02:15:31.04 origin, I'm going to represent it put them on. Then what pizza did I didn't tell you this talk?
02:15:31.04 --> 02:15:35.60 He goes, he goes, yeah, you know, it is more of a stylish thing. He's like, you can pull it off.
02:15:35.60 --> 02:15:43.52 I was like, ooh, thanks, bro. You can. And truly, truly, 100% true. Now, I like I have joggers. I'm kind
02:15:43.52 --> 02:15:48.16 of into joggers. No, I even bought pants that weren't sweat pants that were that jogger style.
02:15:48.16 --> 02:15:53.36 And I'm not joking. Yeah. I came to me on the mat. He's like, hey, man, I was hoping you'd signed
02:15:53.36 --> 02:15:59.52 this book for me. But I got to tell you, I bought joggers yesterday. I was like, I can't do it.
02:15:59.52 --> 02:16:03.52 Well, it's not signing. You can't say that after I signed it, but it's not. But the thing is,
02:16:03.52 --> 02:16:08.40 they're not only, okay, so you have joggers, which I did, because if you do really jog in them,
02:16:08.40 --> 02:16:12.64 like they are, it's like they're ergonomically kind of made for actual jogging, because they don't
02:16:12.64 --> 02:16:16.80 flap on the bottom or whatever, and they give you room in the depth of difference between joggers and
02:16:16.80 --> 02:16:22.56 the sweats or something. Yeah, what if I'm not mat, just the shape. So, and this, I'm just assuming
02:16:22.56 --> 02:16:26.72 that's not what the shape is different. But what is the difference? They're more on the thing. Yeah,
02:16:26.72 --> 02:16:31.04 they're slimmer on the legs, and then usually they're a little bit more roomy in the hips, right?
02:16:31.04 --> 02:16:34.80 Like in the, are the knees roomy at all? Mm.
02:16:36.80 --> 02:16:42.32 That's good. That's good. That's good. Any more roomy for me? I get it. Yeah. Anyway,
02:16:43.20 --> 02:16:48.40 they're functionally sound is what I'm saying. Yeah. But you add that in which I've said this,
02:16:48.40 --> 02:16:54.000 I don't know what Rachel caught into whatever you guys are using, but I've named them officially,
02:16:54.000 --> 02:16:57.92 by the way. Okay, I have the most comfortable pants in the world. The most comfortable pants in the
02:16:57.92 --> 02:17:01.04 world. The most comfortable pants in the world. Do what I'm taking that? Can I take that?
02:17:01.04 --> 02:17:06.32 It's yours. Do the men? You know what goes good with the joggers is our hoodies, and you know,
02:17:08.32 --> 02:17:12.72 I tell you why I walked in last night, to the training. It was last night. That's like,
02:17:12.72 --> 02:17:16.96 oh, a jogger, it's wearing a hoodie. And I was like, and that was on the other side of the room,
02:17:16.96 --> 02:17:21.92 and I was like, that's a good looking hoodie here alone. And I was like, but it's all black. I was like,
02:17:21.92 --> 02:17:29.28 what the frick is he wearing? I was like, he brought a hoodie. I had a different hoodie.
02:17:29.28 --> 02:17:32.96 And then I started walking closer, and then you started coming over and I was like, oh,
02:17:32.96 --> 02:17:38.56 it's a black on black origin hoodie. Yeah. I was like, that was pretty badass. Yeah.
02:17:38.56 --> 02:17:43.60 I keep hoodies for a really long time. Yeah. Like t-shirts. Only they don't wear out as
02:17:43.60 --> 02:17:48.56 quick, right? So you can wear out any for a long time. That new hoodie we've developed though out of the
02:17:48.56 --> 02:17:52.24 infinity fleece. That's probably going to be a lot. Let's be eating it on the other
02:17:52.24 --> 02:17:57.76 than last forever. Uh, one ounce we got. We got supplements. Some joint warfare.
02:17:58.96 --> 02:18:08.72 Some creloil. Some discipline. Did you know that joint warfare for origin is the top selling product
02:18:09.68 --> 02:18:14.40 across the board when it comes to like all jujitsu, all nutrition, everything we make.
02:18:14.40 --> 02:18:20.64 The joint warfare has the greatest impact on humanity than any other product. Makes sense.
02:18:20.64 --> 02:18:26.40 It's an unbelievable. It's unbelievable. Yeah. No, people are into it myself included.
02:18:26.40 --> 02:18:31.68 My something. And you know, uh, be little was telling me that I love how we call
02:18:31.68 --> 02:18:38.96 it be little. When you say that, what it does to my brain, I mean, it's like eating ice cream.
02:18:38.96 --> 02:18:46.16 Just say be little one time moving. Yeah. Just no, I was talking to be little. But just now I just caught
02:18:46.16 --> 02:18:51.52 that like she little like, okay, it's be period little, right? You know, you sure. Right now I've
02:18:51.52 --> 02:18:55.76 just caught the fact that it's like the same is like be little like you're belittling somebody.
02:18:55.76 --> 02:19:00.88 Oh, I just caught that right now. I didn't know. I thought that that's why it was so funny. I didn't know.
02:19:00.88 --> 02:19:06.08 I just got it. I was so funny. Why did you even think it was funny without knowing that it was
02:19:06.08 --> 02:19:13.68 be little because I thought it made him the small. Oh, I'm physically small. Be little. Yeah. Yeah.
02:19:13.68 --> 02:19:19.12 Yeah. Like be like because because his name was you could be strong. You could be little exactly.
02:19:19.12 --> 02:19:22.72 Or you could be little. So I was like, it's like you tell him basically little.
02:19:22.72 --> 02:19:27.92 Yeah. I always thought of it as like be little like I'm a little bit of you.
02:19:29.76 --> 02:19:34.64 Dude, you know, the great. I had someone call it to be a camp. We were in the cafeteria like one of the first days
02:19:34.64 --> 02:19:39.68 and he comes up to me and he's kind of got his head down a lot of business like hey,
02:19:39.68 --> 02:19:43.20 I was like hey, and I thought he's in a say something like it's great to meet you because that's
02:19:43.20 --> 02:19:47.28 you know my ego whatever and he's like is be little here.
02:19:49.52 --> 02:19:54.72 It's like yes he is. So glad you asked that. Anyways, what were you talking about be little.
02:19:54.72 --> 02:20:02.88 Be little. Oh yeah. Well, he just he just said if someone's has to choose between joint warfare
02:20:02.88 --> 02:20:06.64 and krill oil. He said if you're doing
02:20:09.28 --> 02:20:15.36 if you're trying to recover something joint warfare joint warfare if you're doing maintenance
02:20:16.40 --> 02:20:21.60 krill oil because the krill will maintenance other areas as well. So anyways, that's that I
02:20:22.72 --> 02:20:28.16 yeah you can I and what's unfortunate for me is when people ask me which one I don't know what to tell
02:20:28.16 --> 02:20:34.56 them because I've been taking you know I take them both all the time in pretty heavy doses. So anyways,
02:20:34.56 --> 02:20:40.64 also mock train big time mulch train still on the mulch train by the way. Yeah, obviously because
02:20:40.64 --> 02:20:46.16 this plenty of mulch to go around over here. Yeah. Well, you think you'll try to fill off the mulch
02:20:46.16 --> 02:20:50.24 train ever. I don't see it happening. So Pete and I just had a conversation because we were in a rush to
02:20:50.24 --> 02:20:57.20 get down here to do this and we kind of we kind of did a week do we know we we collided we collided
02:20:57.20 --> 02:21:04.40 at the chocolate milk station up at the cafeteria and we did and I was like yeah I don't have
02:21:04.40 --> 02:21:07.12 time to go down and make a mole right now I'm just going to drink this and he's like yeah there's
02:21:07.12 --> 02:21:13.12 something about chocolate milk. I would literally a hundred percent rather have mulch peanut butter
02:21:13.12 --> 02:21:17.12 or mulch chocolate mint or chocolate mint or a hundred percent rather have that than
02:21:17.52 --> 02:21:21.28 did chocolate milk. And we're going to talk to them 100 percent. You can take and taste
02:21:21.28 --> 02:21:28.32 the nasty sugar corn syrup when you drink regular chocolate milk. Yeah, it's like like when you get
02:21:28.32 --> 02:21:31.92 used to the milk it's like a kind of drink soda. You drink soda. You drink soda. You
02:21:31.92 --> 02:21:38.32 from time to time. You ever drink like Coca Cola? No, I don't drink Coca Cola ever. What do you drink?
02:21:38.32 --> 02:21:46.000 You fan. Okay. So you guys want to know if you ever stop drinking soda, if you ever stop drinking
02:21:46.000 --> 02:21:52.56 soda and then you go back and have one it tastes so syrupy and sweet. To me that's what
02:21:52.56 --> 02:21:58.08 chocolate milk tastes like now it's got this nasty and it's not it's not it doesn't taste sweeter
02:21:58.08 --> 02:22:06.000 it tastes more syrupy mulch. It's like if you drink like a coke or a phanta in your case like
02:22:06.000 --> 02:22:10.72 right after training. You seem to say instead of like a water. I do get to say like I don't drink
02:22:10.72 --> 02:22:17.52 a lot of soda. Okay. It all. So it has to taste my house. Did you taste it? No, there's something about
02:22:17.52 --> 02:22:23.52 phanta. Okay. That which one they can't deny. Great pineapple. Great pineapple. Yeah, it's
02:22:23.52 --> 02:22:29.36 not all of it. It's undesignated these. Yeah, so like I'm not even kidding once every two months.
02:22:30.16 --> 02:22:35.76 My son. So we wouldn't my kids never drink soda and when my son was like six or seven years old
02:22:35.76 --> 02:22:41.36 I brought him to the team when I was at trade at and we did like a monster mash which is in the
02:22:41.36 --> 02:22:45.92 team's monster mash is when you set up just like obstacle course and then run and then a boat
02:22:45.92 --> 02:22:50.56 carry and just set up all these crazy things and they'll just do all these weird stuff and one of
02:22:50.56 --> 02:22:57.12 the stations was you had to drink a whole can of coke through a straw and then you had to like
02:22:57.12 --> 02:23:01.12 do a sprint over the Burma or whatever and so my son's doing all this stuff with me and he gets
02:23:01.12 --> 02:23:05.84 the coke and he's like looks at me like can I drink it and I was like brothers to the teams.
02:23:05.84 --> 02:23:11.28 Get drunk. They're drinking quick and so he like drinks it down and as he's drinking it you can
02:23:11.28 --> 02:23:17.04 see him like his initial face is like oh and then it just like his face just goes all like
02:23:17.04 --> 02:23:21.12 and then he just looks like turns that kind of pale when you could see he was feeling it wasn't
02:23:21.12 --> 02:23:25.60 like too much. So he still doesn't drink coke. Yeah man. That's a good no no no so let's
02:23:25.60 --> 02:23:31.44 but I think we've got a milk movement in farming to mean what's the milk mix it well you know
02:23:31.44 --> 02:23:35.04 is we've got the kids that come because my kids are in junior high and high school and they come
02:23:35.04 --> 02:23:40.000 and then they bring their friends in and every time they say me they just like kind of look at
02:23:40.000 --> 02:23:47.36 me and yeah for milk they're like and they'll be like that milk is so good. They're like
02:23:47.36 --> 02:23:52.08 guys pretty good isn't it hanging around down underneath the bridge drinking milk. Exactly.
02:23:52.08 --> 02:23:55.84 What are you guys doing today going to this circle to drink more?
02:23:57.84 --> 02:24:01.52 A immersion camp 2019 we sold this one out which was kind of new.
02:24:02.32 --> 02:24:07.12 There was actually one of the one of the girls here I was talking to her and she's all fired up
02:24:07.12 --> 02:24:11.92 and her brother she's like my brother's so mad he couldn't come and I said oh why couldn't he come
02:24:11.92 --> 02:24:17.68 she's like it's sold out. So can you imagine brother sister sister gets his own brother doesn't get to go.
02:24:17.68 --> 02:24:23.84 So they did prioritize and execute soon enough. Are we gonna be able to get more people next year?
02:24:24.56 --> 02:24:28.88 Yes you know the agreement we had with the contract with the camp limitless to a certain amount
02:24:29.60 --> 02:24:34.96 but talking with the owner camp laurel he's like you we can expand more for you guys to make
02:24:34.96 --> 02:24:40.24 that happen because they they actually want us here because it's just great for them it's great for us
02:24:40.24 --> 02:24:44.24 it's it's it's not like they're taking a care of a bunch of kids let's put it that way.
02:24:44.24 --> 02:24:48.88 Cool yeah no that's gonna be a lot of so look for that at origin all those things origin
02:24:48.88 --> 02:24:55.28 main.com that's where you can find all that cool origin stuff and support a little something called
02:24:55.92 --> 02:24:59.04 America while you're doing it get some also
02:25:00.08 --> 02:25:05.12 Jocco has a store similar to jujitsu for operations camp
02:25:05.92 --> 02:25:12.000 no curriculars and operations jujitsu offense for combat killing operations. All right there you go
02:25:12.000 --> 02:25:16.16 you're too too offense for combat killing operations. So in that same vein
02:25:17.76 --> 02:25:24.000 Jocco has a store he named it. Jocco store yeah yeah so it makes more sense not even to me and I've been
02:25:24.000 --> 02:25:27.52 in the game for a while anyway Jocco store that's where you can get if you want
02:25:28.80 --> 02:25:34.56 these shirts it's a discipline equals freedom. Jocco's head on it says good you know all this stuff

02:28:33.12 --> 02:28:38.08 cool he's extremely creative he designed a few a few things though like you've designed things like
02:28:38.08 --> 02:28:46.32 you he like actually drew it out really like draw no you never seen a draw yeah what I draw
02:28:46.32 --> 02:28:50.96 first I would I drew for you I drew on power point yeah we did it on bro yeah I did I
02:28:50.96 --> 02:28:57.76 I agree not to I just remember I draw for you you just draw for me some kind of packaging or
02:28:57.76 --> 02:29:02.96 something yeah on the packaging you're like no how about like this you drew it out remember you're
02:29:02.96 --> 02:29:10.80 like that took like two hours but the concepts are like kind of solid though seems like it's he
02:29:10.80 --> 02:29:16.96 understands composition and color theory and lately yeah deep bro I wasn't going to know for
02:29:16.96 --> 02:29:23.76 him for real yeah well he does he understands those things and they like red so you got to give
02:29:23.76 --> 02:29:30.48 him a you guys be quiet I'm over here innately understanding color theory I'm going to need some time
02:29:30.48 --> 02:29:35.68 why don't you think what I walked in that grab this folder and I was like that would make a good
02:29:35.68 --> 02:29:40.72 t-shirt or that what I did you understand it or because he understands because whoever did that

02:30:17.20 --> 02:30:23.52 composition one more time also anyway you work in our hearts yeah they are good
02:30:23.52 --> 02:30:29.68 it's good anyway also if you're working out you're on the path you're working out yeah I
02:30:29.68 --> 02:30:36.40 I have been but I got off the working out tranks I swelbed up too much yeah so now I just drink
02:30:36.40 --> 02:30:40.80 more contrages you hooked up too yeah yeah I did I did seriously you realize you can
02:30:40.80 --> 02:30:44.88 switch up the workout so you don't you've been teaching me some things about that we're talking
02:30:44.88 --> 02:30:53.44 the other day well yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah so we're talking about
02:30:53.44 --> 02:30:58.64 on it anyway my kettlebells all pretty pretty much all my new workout stuff like this switching
02:30:58.64 --> 02:31:03.92 up from bulking up all of it all on it stuff all of it a kettlebells make cast iron cast iron
02:31:03.92 --> 02:31:09.68 cast iron if I'm not mistaken cast yeah yeah but I got the cool ones the primal bells and whatnot
02:31:09.68 --> 02:31:14.40 that's the dope one that's a pretty cool process have you ever seen how that works yeah yeah we
02:31:14.40 --> 02:31:20.56 when I was in college we myself and my friends built a foundry at the college and what you did
02:31:20.56 --> 02:31:28.24 is you start to make those kettlebells you actually start with a wax it's wax and you dip the wax
02:31:28.24 --> 02:31:33.12 you you make these little vents like air holes yeah air holes and then you dip the wax and
02:31:33.12 --> 02:31:37.60 what's called slurry chr-chr and then you melt the wax out of the slurry and you fill it with
02:31:37.60 --> 02:31:44.000 molten metal and it cools and you won't crack it molten molten metal or they say molten
02:31:44.000 --> 02:31:50.16 yeah and then you end up with something badass yeah yeah yeah and they balance some it's like
02:31:50.16 --> 02:31:55.44 yeah it's a pride it's pretty cool it's one thing to be like okay here's a perfectly round ball
02:31:55.44 --> 02:31:58.64 you know and it's all balanced you know because you got to swing that thing around can't be
02:31:58.64 --> 02:32:03.44 swinging in one way and then the other way you hurt yourself yeah so they you know they make
02:32:03.44 --> 02:32:08.16 the artistic ones but they're still balanced that's deep anyway no I get it no we're just together
02:32:08.16 --> 02:32:13.68 now yeah plus you're artistic so you need to artistic kettlebells you're right absolutely right
02:32:13.68 --> 02:32:18.32 well they have other cool stuff on there switch up your workout if you want to bulk up while
02:32:18.32 --> 02:32:25.92 you're moking up like Pete Roberts you want to trim down and slim down just anyway you know what

02:34:13.68 --> 02:34:19.92 it's a path that everybody would want their kids to be on and would want any kid to be on I don't
02:34:19.92 --> 02:34:25.60 care who you are you're going to want your kids on this path um extreme ownership we talked about
02:34:25.60 --> 02:34:31.28 it a bunch today you know Pete Pete talked about how you know you've used it I think you gave
02:34:31.28 --> 02:34:37.12 great examples and you've also seen dichotomy leadership dichotomy leadership available for
02:34:37.12 --> 02:34:45.12 your to right now if you want first of this do you know I was thinking about like extreme ownership
02:34:45.12 --> 02:34:49.36 the book and then that caromy leadership the book you know what that's like it's like you're
02:34:49.36 --> 02:34:55.28 watching movie major league you're watching movie no I think I have for a while you're seeing Wesley
02:34:55.28 --> 02:35:00.72 Snipes they go on you know Cleveland Indians anyway yes I have so this is what have been Charlie
02:35:00.72 --> 02:35:05.92 Sheenie comes out of jail whatever it's like a rag tag group of guys they put together pro team baseball
02:35:05.92 --> 02:35:14.40 Cleveland Indians Charlie Sheen comes in he has the fastest fastball ever but it's control like he
02:35:14.40 --> 02:35:20.08 you know he's ripping him in the shoulders and yeah you know it turns out he just needs glasses whatever
02:35:20.08 --> 02:35:27.84 but so yeah all this speed and power power but his control hasn't come around that's what extreme
02:35:27.84 --> 02:35:32.56 ownership is but you get the dichotomy leadership that's the control so I'm saying so you get
02:35:32.56 --> 02:35:37.52 X humanish it be got the power now but you need the control too that's the dichotomy leadership tune it in
02:35:37.52 --> 02:35:42.96 seems saying that we have the most sensible thing I've heard it's said with reference to a movie
02:35:42.96 --> 02:35:49.28 there's a good metaphor you really I just I don't and here's a thing
02:35:50.64 --> 02:35:54.24 I'm not gonna say you can't own one without the other what I'm gonna say is this
02:35:54.24 --> 02:36:03.20 if you don't own one without the other you're doing yourself at the service because
02:36:04.24 --> 02:36:08.32 there are two tools that work together you know I mean you need the both tools
02:36:10.000 --> 02:36:16.16 or you're not gonna fully you know become who you want to become as a leader so get the two tools
02:36:16.16 --> 02:36:22.72 that's it it's easy agree plus you want to control that fastball yeah yeah man power is good
02:36:22.72 --> 02:36:30.08 but the power is good control a speaking of leadership I got a leadership consulting company
02:36:30.08 --> 02:36:35.52 it's called echelon front we solve problems through leadership that's what we do we do it all day

02:40:27.28 --> 02:40:36.32 out there making sacrifices every day to literally keep us free and thanks to police law enforcement
02:40:36.32 --> 02:40:42.16 correction officers fire fighters board patrol paramedics and all other first responders here at home
02:40:42.16 --> 02:40:52.40 thanks for your sacrifices to keep us safe and everyone else out there you know someone at the
02:40:52.40 --> 02:41:00.40 immersion camp said that jiu jitsu could seem frustrating because you try things and they just don't
02:41:00.40 --> 02:41:05.68 work and you practice and you drill and you try them again and things don't work and it said
02:41:05.68 --> 02:41:12.80 to person just said that jiu jitsu can seem frustrating and I said jiu jitsu just doesn't seem
02:41:12.80 --> 02:41:22.80 frustrating it is frustrating it is frustrating it's a grind it's hard it's overwhelming it's
02:41:22.80 --> 02:41:32.56 infuriating it's irritating and it can also be very disappointing and in all those ways jiu jitsu is just
02:41:32.56 --> 02:41:42.72 like life life is going to be hard it's going to be frustrating it's going to be disappointing it's
02:41:42.72 --> 02:41:54.80 going to be overwhelming but like those settlers in New England you keep at it and you keep working
02:41:54.80 --> 02:41:59.84 and you keep driving and pushing and grinding and then you get a little something you see a little
02:41:59.84 --> 02:42:07.04 bit of light you make a little bit of progress and then you dig in and you do it again
02:42:10.08 --> 02:42:16.88 and jiu jitsu is an easy and neither is life and that is what makes them both so worth doing
02:42:16.88 --> 02:42:29.68 with everything you've got so get out of bed shut off the TV and pose your will on the world
02:42:29.68 --> 02:42:37.92 and when you get be down by the world get back up again and get after it
02:42:37.92 --> 02:42:53.84 and until next time this is Peter Roberts and echo and jockel out
