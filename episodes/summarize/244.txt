and so that's why when someone comes without the skill set in the civilian sector they can learn that skill set very quickly because they've been learning all these different skill sets for eight years 12 years 20 years 25 years that's what we do in the military it's a new stuff all the time going here section called the cost of talent when companies lack a talent mindset it's a common refrain cost creating a robust talent acquisition and management process is simply too costly they say what most companies don't understand is the major cost is not money but time and devotion to creating a world class talent acquisition pipeline in the process you will actually save money in the long run as your tuition lowers and you consistently make better hires the special operations community has long understood that people are everything special operations soldiers go through three main stages assessment and selection training and combat and war and then you guys break this out so in special operations it's called assessment and selection in business it's called talent acquisition or the hiring process and special operations it's called training in business it's called talent management and leadership development and then in special operations called combat and war and in business it's called business sales marketing production whatever is that you're doing it's a pretty good little break out there of how similar these things really are going in another section here may companies have a fundamental misalignment between upper leadership and HR where leadership says they want talent but HR is not set up to actually hire for talent in fact HR often doesn't even know what talent looks like in the company there's no gold standard of talent instead hiring is mechanical order taking process based on objective requirements leadership gives HR a laundry list of what they want years of experience required skill set compensation range and HR goes out and fills the order to have effective talent acquisition your business leaders and HR department must be strategic partners the talent acquisition team must be students of the business understanding the organizations underlying goals and talent needed to achieve them since day one in my career Joe DePento told us and that's the CEO of 711 I've always had my CHRO linked at the hip and will continue to as Joe is discovered to function strategically your HR department must be a part of the planning process for both talent acquisition and management HR should be involved in succession planning and gap analysis to assess select and develop talent in a strategic way you know we we found this you know I kind of knew it intuitively and I suspected it but but if I'm just company out there that wants to hire so I go to efoverwatch.com I fill out the various information and then we're going to set up a call and you're going to talk with Mike he'll talk to myself you may talk with one other person and we're going to really kind of dig in with you as to okay let's talk about your company what is your position in the market what are you trying to accomplish where are you trying to grow what are your leadership gaps what are your individual contributor gaps you know we want to know both of those things you know what are those things that are keeping you up at night and then let's talk about how talent and leadership solves those problems and are you committed to leadership is the most important thing in your business and you know we'll also walk through to find out the maturity of their hiring process and how they've done it because you know we we want to make sure that they know how to do because they're mechanics behind this as well we've helped with offer letters I've helped with compensation you know structuring complex offers which which is not easy for small and medium business to do a lot of times they just don't have that expertise so we will sit down and spend a good hour hour and a half with them you know diagnosing you know why did they come to us what is it that they need what can we solve for them and should we be working together and I'm sorry oh you know what hey we have an open position over here you know we've authorized 10 head count in this particular department you've got an empty seat what do you need that's not a plan that's just that's a button to see like we talked about you you have to take that time to say what does my organization look like as far as talent and people it's one of the many things that because everybody's focused on everything else they don't take the time to go what's gonna bring us into 21 what's gonna bring us into 22 you and like Don Roberts and said in our book you have to be higher for the skills and needs of the future where your company is gonna go and I think we even brought it up it's like the term is fighting in the last war you know you're not thinking ahead is to what you're gonna need and so there's no plan to go after that and build that for the future this is one of those things where you it happens to echelon front sometimes be working with a company and and you know they're whatever company is it happens all the time companies caught up in that firefight day to day they're trying to survive they're trying to make things happen they got projects do they got all the things going on Next section is about attracting top talent what talented people look for attracting talent requires knowing what talented people want many companies assume that the answer is money and perks they offer competitive salaries and wonderful creature comforts high end expression machines fully stocked kitchens pool tables and more and yet they still have rich talent on the other end we've seen countless people turn down higher pay to stay with the company where they feel challenged and love the people they work with if you want people to dedicate their talents to your company you must offer something equally valuable in return since talented people have high drive they are interested they're just as interested in achievement and challenge as money let's not fool ourselves if your compensation benefits are not competitive within your industry you'll lose out on talent but attracting top people goes beyond that beyond money talented people look for talented leaders and colleagues a sense of community a challenge opportunities for professional and personal growth and purpose talent attracts talent it's a magnet good leaders or you want to go even in my military career I know who those good leaders are and I'm like yeah uh a beast now I tell people I worked with Johnny Kim you know I start with Johnny Kim that's awesome the origins of the soft talent minds at the very core of soft is a talent mindset the idea that small group of talented individuals can be effective fighting force capable of defeating larger enemy forces in delivering strict strategic impacts through skull small scale operations three innate traits of lead spot special operations talent mindset and subsequent success one no one has prior special operations experience so raw talent must be the selection criteria the most effective selection is based on mindset and character that's a crazy thing to think about that when you go into special operations they're most of the time there's zero experience in special operations you know that's just that's like a crazy thing to think about where does that seal come from he comes from a high school you know this is the story you know we're working with business leaders and they think they need to experience it so important man Jeremy he's got four years of experience you go on most companies would choose Jeremy without hesitation Chris's GPA was average compares to Jeremy's but he didn't have the industry specific experience but he was one of those people who perform time and time again whatever you put in front of him you'd find a way through it over it or around it he was relentless and adaptable so you go on they they have eventually chose Jeremy over Chris and two weeks later the guy calls up and says we made a huge mistake that's how it turns out that click that click time and time again it and here's the funny thing is you remember tray holder who helped us out during the infancy of if ever watched we had this call and it was either we can have to two weeks after they made that selection and this leader within the company who we had a personal relationship said hey this guy is an arrogant you know what he's like we've got a problem and you know we're not going to say hey we told you so the guy he's trying to run a major distribution center he made a call we're there to support him and our basic question was well do you want to talk to our candidate he said no and said we asked what what are you going to do about it he said nothing and I just asked him was said if you have some of the that you feel is going to poison the culture why aren't you going to do anything and it was if I get let him go two weeks into the job my senior leaders are going to look at me like what are you doing down there and so that individual was going to let it ride I haven't talked to him I'm sorry so the the question jocca absolutely it's going to be a series of phone calls we want to know everything about your business about your industry and a lot of times the reason we do these phone calls because what business the leaders think they want is not necessarily what they need and our our job as well during that is to advise them based off what we're hearing what we think you really need is x, y, z, not a, b, c and our clients have followed our advice and it's worked out beautifully what you know we're in that advice is coming from nothing but scars and failures especially with 20 years of talent acquisition between him and uh currently so we we want a very very strong relationship with our clients if they sign the contract beyond that then it gets into the talent sink for what what what a talent sink is for us is we're going to spec out what that position is and what are the attributes they're truly looking for from there we we tell him hey we're going to need usually two to three weeks to start screaming and assessing potential leaders the the people the the right leaders for this position it could be through our organic town pool we're also going to run an external search for people we haven't touched yet that maybe out there that may be a good fit for that role and that takes time and our clients again we're preaching patience we have a pretty darn good fill speed rate to fill and if people allow us to go through our process John strike reminder was talking about that and how there was like people in the special forces community that were saying all this is garbage you're gonna get these guys that don't know what they're doing but like so many of those sag operators went right from boot camp to you know to a it and then on the special force and then they went right over to Vietnam and freaking just got after he he like was laughing about it because those guys were just freaking legit what with general boikom was telling the story you know you had senior leaders when he was the commander of use to sock which is he's the commander of all army special operations and they were arguing there's two camps of no we can't accept people without conventional infantry experience and the other camp was hey know we can take people off the street and turn them into great special forces soldiers and of course what there is a command soldier major use to sock sitting back the senior and listed visor wall both camps fought and finally he said when he piped in he said hey I was an OJT soldier in Vietnam yeah that's a big that's a big change actually it's not even that big of a change it's a little change that will have a huge impact you start getting people to really start to grow the or grow an organization properly with the right people that's exactly what you're talking about you go into this section here I'm skipping ahead this section here that I liked it's it's entitled fear based hiring special operations community has become world class model for potential based hiring which is their foundation of their assessment and selection process in contrast many companies instead of hiring the candidates with the most potential higher those candidates that inspire the least amount of fear this kind of fear based hiring usually comes down to one of three fallacies number one red flags are more important than green flags number two leaders shouldn't be outshined by their followers and number three somebody's better than nobody you go on in traditional corporate hiring practices the objective has seemingly shift from higher the best to higher the familiar and safe people are more afraid of a bad higher than they are excited by a good higher you go on here fear based hiring is dogmatic about objective requirements you guys already talked about this black and white criteria make it easy to say yes or no does this person have ex years of industry experience does this person have wide degree these criteria don't matter nearly as much as you might think the ten-conylbrient decor former commander of army special forces assessment selection told us when I arrived in my command anything easily measured was heavily weighted in the selection process the problem was it didn't have a lot of predictive value the same is true in business just because you can measure something doesn't mean it's important and just because you can't measure something doesn't mean it's not important the only question that truly matters is does this person have the potential to be a top performer don't disregard red flags entirely but don't obsess over them either in combat you don't want to get shot but at the same time if you're primary concern is not getting shot then you don't go into battle if you make your hiring decision based on avoiding your worst case scenario you'll never achieve your best case scenario it's far more effective to look for green flags than for red flags but you guys have pointed out earlier the US military is in the most powerful force in the world it's the US economy and that was one of the things we wanted to do with this book was to we want to continue to contribute to strengthen that you go into a skip and ahead a little bit you go into a scenario and it just it just spells out exactly what you're talking about you got a guy Daniel you go into this Daniel's looking to hire candidates for sales leadership position and he used two search firms EF Overwatch which is what which is excellent front and a competitor and Jeremy so this is here's the two people that got presented Jeremy presented by a competitive search firm 3.9 GPA from a prestigious university high intelligence four years of industry experience with two different companies driven highly competent borderline arrogant Chris presented by EF Overwatch 3.2 GPA from a public university above average intelligence faced significant adversity in life came from a lower middle class family and held a full-time job on college recently separated army infantry officer who held several different functional billets in the army has all the attributes are required to be a highly successful sales leader but lacks industry experience which of these candidates would you choose since this chapter is about hiring for character in scale you might know the answer is most likely Chris not Jeremy but be honest at your company which one of these candidates would most likely be hired that's a good question when you put be honest in front of it because right because it's a fear-based hire is to go you know what we don't know about this Chris guy he seems like a good guy using the army but but they're good people right and that those people will come back to you by the way I mean eventually they're gonna come back because you know somebody is over the reason they're leaving us because if you're treating people well the reason people are leaving us because someone is lying to them you know they're lying they're giving them some lying that they're not gonna be able to uphold so when people are leaving it's it's your alumni you got a treat them like you're alumni and say hey good luck let me know if you never need anything you know even though you're working for a competitor it's all right we came up with it good ago you say about nothing worth accomplishing it can be done alone there are no rampos in the military that might look cool in the movies but individual is die pretty quickly on the battlefield or worst get others hurt they're great success requires that we work together curiosity exploring the unknown and questioning the status quo and pursue to better more effective solutions is the key to innovation without curious individuals nothing would ever change or improve emotional strength in the US military and I'm given like these highly abbreviated definitions and you guys go into it not not only do you go into better examples but then not only not only more detailed definitions but examples you know you're talking about the rescue cap and films I mean you got really cool examples in here to back these things up but that's where people buy the books so that they can read those curiosity already covered that emotional strength in the US military the whole man concept is the belief that the individuals need to be assessed based on the entirety of their person mental physical and emotional and emotionally strong individual has a positive attitude high empathy and emotional control in stressful situations many of the individuals we interviewed identified positive attitude as important to their hiring decisions attitude is contagious positivity breeds positivity while negativity be gets more negativity an individual the negative attitude can still produce results but is often at the expense of company culture typically that one person who's also not worth the resulting damage to the team you have highlighted this section emotional strength is the ability to regulate ones emotions to remain logical under stress situations marsawk calls this stress tolerance and defines it as the ability to deal with ambiguous dangerous high pressure or frustrating events while maintaining control of emotions actions composure and effectiveness it is a universal truth in life that humans don't make good decisions in emotional state people who are able to remain cool calm and collected in the face of challenges and the unknown are people you want in your organization this is the exact reason soft creates stressful environments to mimic the conditions of war during assessment and selection programs stress tolerance is so important that some soft organizations even use heart rate monitors to evaluate individuals psychological physiological responses to stress got to stay calm got to be able to detach these were this chapter which so we do see companies that use these personality assessments as a either no go or go criteria and I would caution people not to do that you talked about not being a rules follower funny enough we had a company that recently assessed one of our people and you know I won't say what's physical organization this person works for but he's with a very unique or organization and he's been in that seat for five years which is an indicator that this guy is is a high performing individual ethical absolutely and when he took this test the company came back and said this guy's not you know it shows that he doesn't follow rules and we sort of had to explain the context of the role he was in and say he finds a way to win and that may be why he's not testing well in that one criteria on that assessment so you've got to be cautious even like Josh cotton Dr. Cotton that does this for a living what will caution you with regards to results on assessments he said you got to take it with a grain of salt and some people to use a phrase that that you know I remember hearing it muster actually assessment tests are not inoculations they don't insulate you from making a bad hire they don't inoculate you from you know all the risk in the world you need to use them as my says they're just one more data point and just I have to stop you from thinking that because I know that's what you think you want that's what that's what leaders think they think hey look I've got this all figured out if everyone would just do what I tell them to do run the playbook just do what I say to do will be good to go here's the thing there's no static function in the world that what you want is non-thinking apparatus to run a playbook and if you do if you have something like that yes automate that get a robot to do that task and do them over and over again the same way when you're hiding a leader you want them to be able to adapt and change and make improvements and do whatever they have to do to win that's what you want so if you hear George say hey we don't want someone that's just gonna run the playbook and you're thinking no way I do that do want that no you don't and this was the same thing is happen to the micro managers coming through my train when I was running training you get someone that's thinking hey look I've been I'm either I'm experienced or I know I'm highly educated I know how to run these operations so everyone if everyone just get in line and just do what I tell them to do will be good to go and what is that turned into it's micro management that you can't tell everyone what to do there's no way you can be everywhere or once and everything falls apart you need thinking shooters is what we used to call it Mike and I are working with you and everything goes perfectly you don't get to declare victory people grow people change products change the environment changes people move on you have to keep after this this is a discipline that you need to bring to your company and when you do you will have a competitive advantage it's the path it's part of the path back to the book far too often a company will hire talented candidate a talented candidate who's performance ends up being lackluster the company chalks up to a bad hire fires the person starts all over again a costly assumption there are many reasons someone might not be performing as you expect and only one of them is a bad hire chances are if a talented individual is not performing to standard it's not their fault it's yours a little extreme ownership coming at you live public talent work talent development you guys talk about training mentoring and coaching good quote and hear from Jonah Pinto from 711 CEO most important thing in any organization is leadership it's always leadership first because leaders find a way to get things done once again something up a great attitude and and for the listeners to open to is actually a west point the military academy graduate he served as a army officer before he entered the the corporate world leadership is the most critical determinant of achieving victory for business leaders are the ones who drive change makes things happen so when working to transform high potential high potentials into high performers it's critical to identify and develop future leaders that's just the way it's got to be and then wrapping this up a little bit here actually this I'll wrap this up right here with this like it's not quite the closer you know we were talking about to bring this over to the business world you know we talk about effective intelligence and people over indexing on experience they're wanting people to come and take a playbook and run it over here and and assuming that the situations that you're going to find in this particular business are going to be exactly the same and so they're thinking well they've handled these situations over here they'll be able to handle them here will be successful in the story it's the effective intelligence that's not assuming any course of action for a business problem they're looking at it that that ability to take the intellectual horsepower and look at all of the data points all of the indicators all of the little pieces of intel collect them and put them into a cohesive picture that then you explain simply with the plan of attack and it's so different than experience and if we can get people to index on that versus the experience you see the difference immediately you know George we actually we talk about the 70% solution that's a great example what you're you're explaining in a business context is again the guys that are wildly intelligent when they only have 70% of the operational picture they can't make a decision but people high in high effective intelligence can draw threads parallels and make a very decisive decision with interplayed information they're two or three years lied on the experience you were asking for I promise you this hungry they're hungry they want it they want to get after it and the manager says well they don't have the seven years of experience and it goes back to what Brian Decker said you know they picked seven years almost out of the year that seven years is not predictive of success working for a competitor is not predictive of success character attributes are predictive and you need to be watching for those check another fear but fear-based hiring problem leaders shouldn't be outshined by the followers average or underperforming managers often fear hiring someone who outshined them because they don't want to hire themselves out of a job there should never be a maximum standard for talent only a minimum if you're not hiring people better than your current employees you'll never raise the bar for talent within your organization that's just the classic surround yourself with people better better than you I want to work myself out of a job I want to have and we go in a little bit later about succession planning I need to have as many people who can take my place and corporate mercados and do that you know the succession planning we do in the military to muscle memory uh and then let us know uh next one special operations for since our teams teams win not individuals number three special operations teams work in high stakes environments when the stakes are high mediocrity is unacceptable let's look more closely at these traits raw talent this is this is no emphasis on experience raw talent is difficult to identify industry experience on the other hand is far easier to identify and measure this is why business world often falls in the bad habit of overaligning on industry experience and as a hiring criterion special operations does not have that luxury because nobody has prior special operations experience if the soft community began selecting for industry experience the US would not have a special operations community out of necessity special operations had to develop a core competency in potential based hiring where raw talent is the primary consideration that's self-explanatory next one team mentality special operations forces are structured as teams they are incentivized as teams and they win or lose as teams not as individuals in contrast in the biz world in the business world the egos can often rule and the team can be less and emphasized people are rewarded for individual achievements so individuals are often concerned only about their incentives versus the overall health of the organization bad leaders who hire and manage others often accept and often and even encourage mediocre employees because it raises their own value in comparison a team mentality greatly reduces the power of ego 're they're scared to death they want it it just turns into this machine how fast how fast can you hire how fast can you get that butt in the seat I'll take that step further at the risk of being a little bit of a stereo typing people but who's hungrier the person that you know has two years experience going into a role that needs five years experience or wait will you know or the person that has seven years experience going into a role with five years experience required who's who's hungrier who's trying to prove themselves a little bit more I don't know man I'm going to be in Georgia to hear hungry individual that wants to prove themselves and and and I've seen this time and again is you know the recruiters that I've brought up to town acquisition specialist I call them talent consultants because they're really embedded in the business they'll go have talked with this guy and and then you pointed out to me that whatever a year ago so come started an Instagram account so we see our own special operations community building their social media presence so that they can communicate with the next generation of special operations humans the military has been pretty good about this so back in the late nineties or mid nineties ex games was really coming to to to to to fruition and the military started creating their own extreme sports teams because that's where they knew the new talent is that that's where that you know the demographic of the 18 or I'm sorry let's say 15 year olds to the 25 year olds was was pushing towards that time where do you think the military is going now for recruiting video games e-sports teams they're putting e-sports teams together now if you asked our generation when they said hey we're going to go recruit out of the e-sports or video game town pools we'd probably say no way yeah that future seals and future marsawk you know Raiders and special forces are not going to come out of this communities that's wrong that's that's where the new talent lays not all that they're still town out there playing sports you know on teams wrestling and I think that's what you know sort of differentiates us from from a lot of the executive search firms out there is I know we together in George we're going to build this into the number one leadership town acquisition firm in the nation I have no doubt then when people look for directors of leadership in training as well as chief leadership officers they're going to say go to you if overwatch because the men and women were placing know how to train people they know how to create the foundation for strong cultures and that's really where we're making the name right now we'll still place people in the COO roles general management roles but one of my passions for you if overwatch is that that director of leadership in training or the COO position
