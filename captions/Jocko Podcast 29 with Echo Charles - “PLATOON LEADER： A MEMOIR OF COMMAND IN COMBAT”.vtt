00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.44
This is Jocco podcast number 29 with echo Charles and me, Jocco Willink.

2
00:00:12.08 --> 00:00:21.36
Into the midst of this war torn land, we're inserted 22 able body to American soldiers and a platoon leader.

3
00:00:22.64 --> 00:00:29.04
As I made my way to the Patoon Command post, CP, the Sun had already dropped from the sky,

4
00:00:29.04 --> 00:00:34.96
night in the tropics comes fast, and even as I approach the outgoing platoon leader,

5
00:00:34.96 --> 00:00:41.52
the shadows have begun to obscure his facial features. I found him lying on his stomach in

6
00:00:41.52 --> 00:00:48.08
a depression situated roughly in the center of the platoon. As I bent over to introduce myself,

7
00:00:48.08 --> 00:00:55.68
he motioned for me to get down. Assuming that perhaps I was dangerously exposed, I laid down next to him.

8
00:00:55.68 --> 00:01:06.72
Hello, I'm Jim McDonough. I said, feeling somewhat awkward being so formal while lying on my stomach.

9
00:01:07.84 --> 00:01:14.96
Tom Rolf, he said, are you here to take my place? He was unable to conceal his eagerness.

10
00:01:16.32 --> 00:01:19.20
Yes, I replied. Can you tell me what's going on here?

11
00:01:19.20 --> 00:01:27.44
As he began briefing me, it became apparent that the platoon was not the object of his thoughts.

12
00:01:28.48 --> 00:01:32.72
I asked questions about the disposition of the squads, the personalities of the men,

13
00:01:32.72 --> 00:01:39.20
the tactics of the enemy, the attitude of the villagers. He responded by telling me about how difficult

14
00:01:39.20 --> 00:01:44.64
the job was, how much his family needed him, how he never asked to be an infantry lieutenant,

15
00:01:44.64 --> 00:01:51.20
how dangerous and uncomfortable his life had been of late, and how he did not deserve to be wounded or killed.

16
00:01:53.36 --> 00:01:58.72
He was overcome by fear that on his last night in the field, the enemy would somehow

17
00:01:58.72 --> 00:02:06.24
snatch survival away from him. As the hours passed, we did not move from our position in the midst of

18
00:02:06.24 --> 00:02:15.28
the platoon. I became a cutely conscious of our protected posture. All about us, I could hear movement.

19
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.48
I saw silhouettes of soldiers as they moved about, setting up their positions for the night.

20
00:02:21.04 --> 00:02:26.40
I noted that at least one patrol departed from the perimeter, but that the orders for the

21
00:02:26.40 --> 00:02:33.52
patrol did not come from the lieutenant. Rolf lay there, chattering aimlessly into the night,

22
00:02:33.52 --> 00:02:38.24
describing again and again for me the wife and two children he had left behind.

23
00:02:40.24 --> 00:02:48.64
Gradually, he honed in on his point. You've got to understand. I did this for them. They need me.

24
00:02:48.64 --> 00:02:55.44
They need me in one piece. Nervous silence followed as I tried to find his eyes in the darkness.

25
00:02:56.96 --> 00:03:03.44
What was he talking about? The question arose even as the answer was forming all around me

26
00:03:03.44 --> 00:03:12.16
they know what to do. They're good soldiers. Silence again. He was shocked by his own confession.

27
00:03:13.60 --> 00:03:19.12
But at the same time, he was urged on by the bearing of his soul.

28
00:03:20.88 --> 00:03:26.56
I could have been a hero. Sometimes I even wanted to be, but I had to think of my family. You see,

29
00:03:26.56 --> 00:03:30.72
don't you? Most of these men don't have any family. They're just boys.

30
00:03:30.72 --> 00:03:37.28
This shamefulness of his words hit me like a club. He was not the leader of this

31
00:03:37.28 --> 00:03:42.000
platoon. He felt no responsibility for the mission. He felt no compassion for his men.

32
00:03:42.88 --> 00:03:49.60
In his mind, the other members of the platoon existed for only one reason to protect him,

33
00:03:49.60 --> 00:03:56.16
to keep him alive. They were expendable. He was not. He had reason to live.

34
00:03:56.16 --> 00:04:06.40
They did not. I wanted to crawl away, but it was dark and I had no idea where to go. We stopped talking.

35
00:04:07.28 --> 00:04:14.80
I had nothing more to ask. He wanted to say more about his personal concerns. He knew he had gone too

36
00:04:14.80 --> 00:04:19.84
far, but he didn't care. His only concern in the world was to leave that noll as soon as possible.

37
00:04:19.84 --> 00:04:26.32
The platoon and I could be damned. If he survived, justice would have been done.

38
00:04:27.20 --> 00:04:34.96
That night, nothing else mattered for him. His soul lay naked, stripped of pride, guilt, and shame.

39
00:04:37.76 --> 00:04:46.40
They were affections of the civilized world out here, only living mattered.

40
00:04:46.40 --> 00:04:53.52
Unable to sleep, unable to move, I lay there wondering which I would turn out to be.

41
00:04:53.52 --> 00:04:59.28
The crazed killer I had met in Qnon, or the blatant coward beside me in the dark.

42
00:05:00.56 --> 00:05:04.16
Which one was more devoid of humanity? I did not know.

43
00:05:05.76 --> 00:05:09.28
Later, after almost three months in the field, I saw Role again.

44
00:05:09.28 --> 00:05:16.24
At the battalion, secure behind the battalion perimeter of L. Z. North English,

45
00:05:17.36 --> 00:05:24.56
he had adopted an air of bravado. In the safety of the officers club, he told me of his brave deeds.

46
00:05:25.28 --> 00:05:33.44
He talked as one who had seen it all. In his own words, he became the dashing, fearless leader of combat infantrymen.

47
00:05:33.44 --> 00:05:41.44
He even had a few combat awards for valor, the procurement of which fell among his duties.

48
00:05:44.32 --> 00:05:50.80
But the most amazing thing of all was his belief in every one of his own words.

49
00:05:51.84 --> 00:05:56.32
As far as he consciously knew, he was all he claimed to be.

50
00:05:56.32 --> 00:06:03.92
He had forgotten how he lay quivering in the dark praying for the enemy, not to come.

51
00:06:05.76 --> 00:06:09.84
From that point on, I began to watch myself carefully.

52
00:06:10.64 --> 00:06:18.24
Was I really what I thought I was, or had I diluted myself as effectively as Role had?

53
00:06:20.56 --> 00:06:23.12
Then the morning the helicopter came to take Role away.

54
00:06:23.12 --> 00:06:29.76
He brought himself to his knees, which was as high as I had seen him rise since my arrival the night before,

55
00:06:30.40 --> 00:06:36.08
and without a word of farewell to me or any of the soldiers he made a desperate dash for the helicopter.

56
00:06:37.44 --> 00:06:46.96
In an instant he was gone, and I recognized with a feeling of awe that I was now in command.

57
00:06:46.96 --> 00:06:54.08
Good evening echo. Good evening.

58
00:06:56.24 --> 00:06:57.60
Back in Vietnam the night.

59
00:06:59.76 --> 00:07:12.32
And this book right here is called Platoon Leader, a memoir of command in combat by James R. McDonough.

60
00:07:12.32 --> 00:07:17.04
He served. He went to West Point.

61
00:07:18.32 --> 00:07:25.28
So four years at West Point, and then he got assigned to the 173rd Airborne Brigade in Vietnam.

62
00:07:27.60 --> 00:07:33.12
And one thing about this book, and this is a fantastic book.

63
00:07:33.12 --> 00:07:36.32
And I'll tell you there's a quote on the back of the book here.

64
00:07:36.32 --> 00:07:39.04
It's the Marine Corps Gazette wrote this.

65
00:07:39.04 --> 00:07:45.36
Stands alone is the finest statement of what it means to be the commander of a small unit.

66
00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:52.88
I hope that every Platoon leader reads, ponderes, and truly absorbs the words of Lieutenant Colonel McDonough.

67
00:07:58.64 --> 00:08:07.60
So it starts off there that was him going to this small little perimeter,

68
00:08:07.60 --> 00:08:16.16
but Platoon perimeter. Outside of a village in Vietnam, he's taking over from the outgoing Platoon commander.

69
00:08:16.16 --> 00:08:20.72
And again, this is something very different than we do in the SEAL teams where you just have a random new

70
00:08:20.72 --> 00:08:25.76
guy show up. It's going to take charge. We're lucky. The way we're set up, we do like an entire

71
00:08:25.76 --> 00:08:30.32
work up and prepare for deployment with the same guys. We're going to be on deployment with.

72
00:08:30.32 --> 00:08:34.88
And then we all go on deployment together. We work together and win the deployments over. We go home.

73
00:08:34.88 --> 00:08:40.96
It's a very solid way of running that system. This is different. There's guys trickling in and out

74
00:08:40.96 --> 00:08:45.60
all the time throughout the entire chain of command, all the way up from the frontline guys,

75
00:08:45.60 --> 00:08:54.000
all the way up to the commander of the Platoon. Fresh out of West Point,

76
00:08:54.000 --> 00:09:05.68
fresh out of college. Yeah, it's a military college, but shows up in Vietnam and here he is in the bush.

77
00:09:04.88 --> 00:09:14.24
Back to the book. I was alone. That was my first sensation as a leader. I gathered up my belongings,

78
00:09:14.24 --> 00:09:19.36
my weapon web gear and rucksack and moved toward the command post. I needed a few minutes to

79
00:09:19.36 --> 00:09:24.56
gather my thoughts before I made my debut as Platoon leader. I knew it was going to be a tricky

80
00:09:24.56 --> 00:09:30.96
business. I had assumed that I would have a company commander nearby to give me orders,

81
00:09:31.84 --> 00:09:36.48
but I had not even met him yet. I would not meet him for weeks. So that's the guy who's above

82
00:09:36.48 --> 00:09:40.000
the Platoon commanders, the company commander. You know, in his mind, he thinks he's going to have

83
00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.08
this company commander somewhere nearby and mentoring him and telling what to do, not happening.

84
00:09:44.72 --> 00:09:47.52
Doesn't have an even hasn't even met him. He's taken over the Platoon. He hasn't even met the

85
00:09:47.52 --> 00:09:54.56
company commander yet. I would not meet him for weeks. The fact was I was totally on my own.

86
00:09:55.28 --> 00:09:59.76
What should I do? Who's advice could I ask? The Platoon sergeants, the squad leaders.

87
00:10:00.72 --> 00:10:05.44
In time I would listen to their ideas and cooperate them with my own, but I could hardly begin

88
00:10:05.44 --> 00:10:11.12
with, well, what do you think we ought to do, men? No, I knew that the basic decisions were mine to make.

89
00:10:13.44 --> 00:10:16.96
Now, I might go in that situation a little bit different and I wouldn't have any

90
00:10:16.96 --> 00:10:21.84
problem. Ask in Platoon sergeants. Then ask in squad leaders. Hey, guys, what's going on?

91
00:10:21.84 --> 00:10:26.16
Getting some feedback from them? What's been working? What's not? I don't think there's any,

92
00:10:26.16 --> 00:10:32.08
I don't think there's anything wrong with that at all. He took a little different tact. He didn't

93
00:10:32.08 --> 00:10:37.20
feel comfortable doing that. And you know, one of the reasons why he didn't feel comfortable doing that

94
00:10:37.20 --> 00:10:42.48
because he's young. He's fresh out of college and he's a little nervous step in this combat role.

95
00:10:42.48 --> 00:10:51.52
Obviously, back to the book. The first few moments would be crucial. Obviously, I was the

96
00:10:51.52 --> 00:10:56.48
object of interest that morning. Everyone was wondering what the new Lieutenant would be like

97
00:10:57.36 --> 00:11:03.28
and I would be telling them with my first words, my gestures, my demeanor, my eyes.

98
00:11:04.32 --> 00:11:07.84
So he knows that everything he does, they're watching him and they're judging him.

99
00:11:07.84 --> 00:11:15.84
I would have no grace period in which to learn my way around. This was a life and death environment.

100
00:11:16.56 --> 00:11:23.12
If I began with a blunder, my credibility as a leader would be shot and so might some of the men.

101
00:11:24.80 --> 00:11:31.12
I decided to begin by giving my attention to tactics in a military environment.

102
00:11:31.12 --> 00:11:36.72
Everything is determined by tactical considerations, where you sleep, when you sleep, where you go,

103
00:11:36.72 --> 00:11:46.32
what you do and in those company, you do it. All are dictated by underlying tactical necessities.

104
00:11:46.32 --> 00:11:50.40
I would communicate my style of leadership through my tactical instructions.

105
00:11:51.68 --> 00:11:58.72
Pretty good call. Pretty good call. Let's just talk tactics. Something that we're all familiar with.

106
00:11:58.72 --> 00:12:06.24
The first thing that occurred to me was the necessity of sending out patrols.

107
00:12:07.28 --> 00:12:13.12
If our actions were strictly defensive, the enemy would be free to pick their tactics. The

108
00:12:13.12 --> 00:12:17.76
initiative would be theirs and this would eventually disprove the illusion of security that the

109
00:12:17.76 --> 00:12:25.36
perimeter wire offered. By training told me that a completely defensive unit is a prime target

110
00:12:25.36 --> 00:12:31.76
for an overwhelming attack. Boom. He knows that out of the gate. Again, they've got this nice little

111
00:12:31.76 --> 00:12:38.08
perimeter set up. They've got 30 or so guys there. They've got to defend this perimeter from attack.

112
00:12:38.08 --> 00:12:42.24
But instead of just staying in a defensive position, he's like we got to go out on patrol.

113
00:12:42.96 --> 00:12:45.76
We got to get out there. We got to disrupt what the enemy's doing.

114
00:12:48.24 --> 00:12:55.12
In combat leadership, as in real estate, location is everything. I was the platoon leader,

115
00:12:55.12 --> 00:13:01.76
and the patroling would be done by squad size elements. Normally, there were 10 men in the squad

116
00:13:01.76 --> 00:13:08.08
and four squads in a rifle platoon. But personnel strengthed being what they were. My squads were

117
00:13:08.08 --> 00:13:14.32
down to only six or seven of men apiece. And there were only three squads. I would be risking

118
00:13:14.32 --> 00:13:21.68
over supervision of the patroling squad. Whose direction was better left to the squad leader if I

119
00:13:21.68 --> 00:13:27.76
went with it? I would also be away from the majority of my platoon back at the perimeter. On the

120
00:13:27.76 --> 00:13:33.52
other hand, to stay with the two squads in the perimeter would deny me the knowledge of the terrain

121
00:13:33.52 --> 00:13:39.36
in which the my platoon operated, and the opportunity to evaluate the quality of the patrols,

122
00:13:39.36 --> 00:13:46.40
the major offensive activity of my tactical position. Moreover, I would not be sharing the highest

123
00:13:46.40 --> 00:13:52.88
risk operations of my men and would therefore might lose their respect. I also might miss my best

124
00:13:52.88 --> 00:14:00.56
chance to appreciate their perceptions, needs, and attitudes. Finally, I might slip into a defensive

125
00:14:00.56 --> 00:14:06.16
attitude myself, and that attitude would eventually overtake the entire platoon.

126
00:14:08.24 --> 00:14:13.52
So, basically, there aren't their inside that perimeter. He's got three squads, and he's sending

127
00:14:13.52 --> 00:14:19.84
the one squad out on patrol on a fairly regular basis. And he's the question, is, you know,

128
00:14:19.84 --> 00:14:25.68
where should I go? What should I do? And he decides that the best thing for him to do is rotate through

129
00:14:26.96 --> 00:14:33.04
and go on patrol with them sometimes. And I love the point of more over, I would not be sharing

130
00:14:33.04 --> 00:14:37.68
in the highest risk operations of my men. So, he knows he's got to take some of the risk that

131
00:14:37.68 --> 00:14:43.28
they're taking, that will also give him a chance to appreciate their perceptions, needs, and attitudes.

132
00:14:43.28 --> 00:14:47.12
So, if you're in a leadership position, and you never get down to the frontline troops and see what

133
00:14:47.12 --> 00:14:52.56
they're doing, see what they're doing on the job site, see what they're doing in the field,

134
00:14:52.56 --> 00:14:58.32
see what's going on out there, you can't understand it. And then he says this, finally,

135
00:14:58.32 --> 00:15:03.20
I might slip into a defensive attitude myself, and that attitude would eventually overtake

136
00:15:03.20 --> 00:15:08.08
the entire platoon, because they're all going to turn into what he's turned into. Or what he is.

137
00:15:11.20 --> 00:15:16.16
Back to the book, if a patrol made contact with the enemy, and it lasted for any length of time,

138
00:15:16.16 --> 00:15:21.44
a second squad would be sent to react. If I were inside the perimeter at such a time,

139
00:15:21.44 --> 00:15:27.68
I would move out with the reaction squad. I firmly believed it was the duty of the combat leader to

140
00:15:27.68 --> 00:15:34.08
move to the sound of the guns, especially when a majority of the unit was engaged.

141
00:15:37.68 --> 00:15:40.56
So, he's going to be there when things go sideways. He's going to move.

142
00:15:43.20 --> 00:15:51.20
Now, back to his feelings on what this is like, even more on spiring than the scenery was the realization

143
00:15:51.20 --> 00:15:57.36
that whatever took place in this part of the world, whatever these men did, or whatever

144
00:15:57.36 --> 00:16:04.88
happened to them, was my responsibility. I might describe myself as a long for the ride,

145
00:16:04.88 --> 00:16:09.44
but whatever happened here, or back at the perimeter, I would have to account for,

146
00:16:09.84 --> 00:16:18.08
to my superiors, to my men, and to myself. I felt I was living a lie. I was trying desperately to

147
00:16:18.08 --> 00:16:25.68
learn what I was already supposed to know. So, the reason he's talking about that is when he goes

148
00:16:25.68 --> 00:16:31.28
out with the squads, there's a guy that's jueyered to him, a sergeant that's running the squads,

149
00:16:31.28 --> 00:16:35.76
running the patrol, and he's not going to go out there and be the boss. He's going to go out there

150
00:16:35.76 --> 00:16:40.32
sort of along for the ride. He's not going to take charge of the squad, he's going to let them do

151
00:16:40.32 --> 00:16:45.04
what they do, and he's going to be more of an observer. But he's, but that doesn't relinquish any

152
00:16:45.04 --> 00:16:49.76
responsibility from him. He still owns it. He's still taking ownership of the whole thing.

153
00:16:49.76 --> 00:16:54.72
And this statement about I felt I was living a lie. I was trying to desperately to learn what I was

154
00:16:54.72 --> 00:16:59.28
already supposed to know. That's very common. For anybody stepping up into a new leadership position,

155
00:16:59.28 --> 00:17:03.28
you don't think you're ready for it. I mean, often, sometimes you feel confident. But a lot of

156
00:17:03.28 --> 00:17:07.52
times people, people who hit me up with questions, they say, you know, I'm taking, I've been promoted.

157
00:17:07.52 --> 00:17:12.72
I don't think I'm ready to do that job. There's very common to feel like that. And my statement

158
00:17:12.72 --> 00:17:17.36
I've said it before, it's okay. Yeah, you know, there's a cognitive bias that

159
00:17:17.36 --> 00:17:25.84
when you're a real smart person, you don't think you're that smart. But when you're not that

160
00:17:25.84 --> 00:17:32.08
smart, you think you're smart. Oh, yeah, 100% of the country. We had these, we had these

161
00:17:32.08 --> 00:17:36.88
forms that we used to make the leaders in the seal platoons fill out. And they would rank themselves.

162
00:17:36.88 --> 00:17:41.28
One, you know, one being the lowest score, five being the highest score. And they'd grade themselves

163
00:17:41.28 --> 00:17:51.44
on whatever 10, 15 different items, tactical knowledge, ability to lead, understanding of the troops,

164
00:17:51.44 --> 00:17:57.12
understanding of the tactics, and they had to grade themselves on everything. And 100% of the time,

165
00:17:57.92 --> 00:18:04.72
100% of the time, I don't make that claim very often. 100% of the time. The guys that

166
00:18:04.72 --> 00:18:08.96
graded them, the guys that were really good, really good leaders and really stepped up and really

167
00:18:08.96 --> 00:18:14.40
doing a great job, they'd give themselves a grade. Their grade average would be like a solid

168
00:18:14.40 --> 00:18:22.56
2.7. Okay. Oh, you know, I could get better at this and I could do better here. The guys that were

169
00:18:22.56 --> 00:18:29.84
not good, they were not good leaders. And their latines were struggling. Literally, their grade average

170
00:18:29.84 --> 00:18:36.48
would be 5.0. They would give themselves a 5 and everything. Their self, that's, you know,

171
00:18:36.48 --> 00:18:43.52
arrogance just completely crushes your ability to do a self assessment. Yeah. Unbelievable. Interesting.

172
00:18:45.76 --> 00:18:51.36
Back to the book, back at the platoon base, I busied myself learning more about the tactical position

173
00:18:51.36 --> 00:18:59.04
and the personality of the men. There was a distance between us in those first hours. I was not sure

174
00:18:59.36 --> 00:19:05.92
of their soldierliness and they were not sure of my leadership. Fair enough, little, little, mutual

175
00:19:05.92 --> 00:19:16.64
assessment going on right there. Now they're out on a patrol and there's one of the, one of

176
00:19:16.64 --> 00:19:26.56
the guys spots a guy named Dunn. He spots somebody and he sort of gets ready to do engage. And

177
00:19:26.56 --> 00:19:36.64
McDonald says, what are you doing? And the sergeants reply was short VC. Me and these are V.

178
00:19:36.64 --> 00:19:44.48
A. Kong. He says, I felt it was time for me to assert myself. I would not allow the squad to fire.

179
00:19:44.48 --> 00:19:48.24
I did not see any weapons and regardless of the political leanings of the older man,

180
00:19:49.20 --> 00:19:54.16
the boy to my way of thinking deserved a little more consideration. Hold off. I said to

181
00:19:54.16 --> 00:20:00.48
Dunn. His looks spoke a thousand words. He wasn't accustomed to being second guest. Not only

182
00:20:00.48 --> 00:20:05.20
he had, he'd been a squad leader. He'd been leading the entire platoon. And the reason he says that

183
00:20:05.20 --> 00:20:12.000
is because in the, the, the old platoon commander who was weak and was hiding. This guy Dunn was out there

184
00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:18.000
making stuff happen. And now I was challenging him. My decision was made and I couldn't back away.

185
00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:23.04
If I relinquish my command, the squad would open fire both of the man and the boy was good as dead.

186
00:20:23.04 --> 00:20:29.52
Maybe Dunn was right. What did I know? I was a newcomer. If I let him give orders the consequences

187
00:20:29.52 --> 00:20:37.84
were his. If I gave orders, they were mine. No, I decided. Either way, the consequences were mine.

188
00:20:38.48 --> 00:20:43.44
I was the senior man. Even if I looked the other way, I would have sanctioned the killing.

189
00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:52.32
I stared back at Dunn. So, he's taking ownership. One might even say he's taking extreme ownership

190
00:20:52.32 --> 00:20:57.92
of the situation. And despite even if the other guy makes a decision, he owns it because he's the

191
00:20:57.92 --> 00:21:07.84
senior guy out there. Now they're continuing. So, they let those guys live. And now they're continuing

192
00:21:07.84 --> 00:21:16.56
the patrol and back to the book. I sensed a slight pull on my right foot and pivoting to my left.

193
00:21:16.56 --> 00:21:25.44
I took a broad step. The roaring in my ear was tremendous. As if in a dream, I began floating

194
00:21:25.44 --> 00:21:31.52
in the direction of my last step. It was still a warm, beautiful, clear day. Yet somehow,

195
00:21:31.52 --> 00:21:37.76
I didn't seem to be there anymore. I was going off into a deep sleep, although my eyes were wide

196
00:21:37.76 --> 00:21:42.32
open. And I could see the soldiers in front of me exactly as they had been a moment ago.

197
00:21:42.32 --> 00:21:49.84
I continued to float. How graceful I felt. Sensing everything in slow motion, I saw the ground rising

198
00:21:49.84 --> 00:21:55.12
to meet my chest. What a perfect landing it was. The ground sliding up underneath me.

199
00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:01.60
Then I heard, then I rose again, rebounding from the impact and the billows of soft,

200
00:22:01.60 --> 00:22:08.32
fine dust particles. Again, I eased down into the dirt, sending a second thicker cloud of

201
00:22:08.32 --> 00:22:15.44
brown debris rising around my face and outstretched hands. A abruptly, the pace of my thoughts

202
00:22:15.44 --> 00:22:24.24
quickened as the surrealistic effects left. My God, we've been hit. Then the pace increased to normal.

203
00:22:24.24 --> 00:22:30.48
Oh no, it's me. I felt sick to my stomach. I thought I would vomit. And I made my first deliberate

204
00:22:30.48 --> 00:22:36.24
movement since the explosion had gone off in my ear. From my prone position, I jerked my head to the

205
00:22:36.24 --> 00:22:46.16
left and gaped at my legs. Oh be there. Please be there. They were there bleeding in torn, but they were there.

206
00:22:47.12 --> 00:22:57.36
I was so happy I wanted to shout with joy. I was euphoric. So he's walking and hits a booby drop.

207
00:22:57.36 --> 00:23:07.04
That description is eerily similar to Jodi Middix's description of getting blown up.

208
00:23:08.40 --> 00:23:14.48
And yeah, I mean, this McDonald ended up in a little bit better situation in the fact that he

209
00:23:14.48 --> 00:23:21.92
kept his legs, but Jodi, the way Jodi describes that in his books, very similar, you know, just boom

210
00:23:21.92 --> 00:23:33.28
and horrible situation. Back to the book, a wounded leader is still a leader. Unless so incapacitated,

211
00:23:33.28 --> 00:23:38.48
he can't make decisions. I wasn't that bad off and I found it somewhat consoling to assert myself

212
00:23:38.48 --> 00:23:43.36
as the man in charge. At the very least, it staved off the shock that would come later.

213
00:23:44.56 --> 00:23:51.76
So they get them out of there and he's on a stretcher anyways, lying naked on a

214
00:23:51.76 --> 00:23:56.32
stretcher suspended between two chairs. I began to suffer the first sensations of shock.

215
00:23:56.96 --> 00:24:03.52
I began to shake so severely and I thought once again, I was going to vomit. I was also afraid

216
00:24:04.80 --> 00:24:11.12
of defecating where I lay. I was so overcome with self-pity that for a second, I caught myself

217
00:24:11.12 --> 00:24:17.68
starting to shed a tear. The morphine was having its effect and I was not in full control of my emotions.

218
00:24:17.68 --> 00:24:24.96
More than anything I was scared. I was no longer afraid I would die. I was afraid because I could have

219
00:24:24.96 --> 00:24:32.40
died. My heart was racing. My body trembling. The ringing in my ear confused. My drug thinking

220
00:24:32.40 --> 00:24:40.24
even more. And I couldn't focus my thoughts. I only knew I had completely failed in my first attempt

221
00:24:40.24 --> 00:24:49.04
to lead a combat action. The West pointer, the paratrooper, the Ranger. He had lasted less than 48 hours,

222
00:24:49.04 --> 00:24:57.36
blown up by his own blundering footwork and ill-considered decisions. How in glorious it all seemed,

223
00:24:57.36 --> 00:25:05.12
lying there in my nakedness. To use on the ground for 48 hours and this happens, go in, take over the

224
00:25:05.12 --> 00:25:12.08
platoon, call in the other guy, a coward basically goes out on his, I think this was his third patrol.

225
00:25:12.08 --> 00:25:18.40
He had done two other patrols, nothing happened on those other patrols and then boom, gets blown up.

226
00:25:21.84 --> 00:25:29.04
Now he's in the hospital. Four other wounded soldiers came aboard. One was gut shot and about four

227
00:25:29.04 --> 00:25:35.12
inches of his stomach or poking out of his middle. He shielded his wounds with his hands as he walked

228
00:25:35.12 --> 00:25:43.84
out to the chopper. One American armored cavalry platoon had just been ambushed in the 506 valley,

229
00:25:44.48 --> 00:25:52.16
south of Bondson. And nine bloated and charred, but still alive soldiers were brought in and placed next

230
00:25:52.16 --> 00:25:59.44
to me. They smelled awful and their pain was excruciating. Mercifully, some were unconscious,

231
00:25:59.44 --> 00:26:06.88
but those awake were screaming. The violent shaking I had experienced at the LZ English was rampant

232
00:26:06.88 --> 00:26:14.72
among the group. I was grateful to be an infantryman. I wouldn't want to travel in gasoline,

233
00:26:14.72 --> 00:26:23.76
fed machines that invariably exploded and burned when hit. A Vietnamese soldier had been brought in

234
00:26:23.76 --> 00:26:30.48
and placed ahead of me, signifying the greater severity of his wounds. He too had been gut shot,

235
00:26:30.48 --> 00:26:37.68
and apparently his stomach and intestines had completely spilled out. His stomach lay quite exposed,

236
00:26:37.68 --> 00:26:44.08
but his intestines still attached had been dumped into a sandbag which was tied securely to his

237
00:26:44.08 --> 00:26:52.000
thigh. When he was brought in, he was unconscious, but after a while he came to, I saw him lift his head

238
00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:59.12
and stare at the sandbag. What he saw made him pass out again. The cycle of coming to,

239
00:26:59.12 --> 00:27:05.28
looking at his intestines and passing out was repeated three times. On the last go around,

240
00:27:05.28 --> 00:27:15.76
he must have died for he was abruptly removed from line and taken away from the operating room.

241
00:27:15.76 --> 00:27:20.32
He doesn't matter what war it is. He goes into that hospital with a bringing in those wounded soldiers

242
00:27:20.32 --> 00:27:35.92
and it's groovy. He gets luckily his wounds weren't that bad. He gets healed up a few weeks

243
00:27:36.80 --> 00:27:43.76
and goes back, right back into it, right back into it, right back into it.

244
00:27:43.76 --> 00:27:53.36
And here they're going out on patrol and I mean, think about that. He got blown up. He's there for

245
00:27:53.36 --> 00:27:59.92
48 hours. He gets blown up. He gets sent to the hospital for three weeks. He heals up. I mean,

246
00:27:59.92 --> 00:28:04.88
you might as well have died when you step on an ID. Just this matters and how big it was.

247
00:28:04.88 --> 00:28:08.08
And this one obviously wasn't big enough to kill him, but if it would have been a little bit bigger,

248
00:28:08.08 --> 00:28:12.32
he'd be dead. Or if a strap and a went in the wrong spot, he'd be dead. Or if he's standing a

249
00:28:12.32 --> 00:28:17.76
little bit closer to you, he'd be dead. Or if whatever, they didn't get him out in time,

250
00:28:17.76 --> 00:28:21.60
he'd be dead. If it had a vein, he'd be dead. If it had an artery, he'd be dead. So he knows that.

251
00:28:22.72 --> 00:28:29.04
And guess what? Doesn't matter. Giddy up, go back out there. You're back in the game. And here we go.

252
00:28:29.84 --> 00:28:36.16
They're going out on patrol. I placed myself fourth in the order of marches. We slid out the wire.

253
00:28:36.16 --> 00:28:42.80
The first 50 yards were tolerable. But as we left the relative security of the perimeter,

254
00:28:42.80 --> 00:28:48.80
further and further behind, I began to dread that each footstep would land me on another booby trap.

255
00:28:49.52 --> 00:28:55.36
I tried not to think about my wounds and the mayhem and gore I'd seen during the past few weeks,

256
00:28:55.36 --> 00:29:01.20
but the more I tried to forget the more clearly I remembered. If I was going to die,

257
00:29:01.20 --> 00:29:08.56
and I began to grieve for myself, for my wife, for the little boy who would never really know his father,

258
00:29:09.68 --> 00:29:16.32
sweat poured from my forehead, my back, my every joint. My stomach was as tight as a knot.

259
00:29:17.20 --> 00:29:27.12
Each step felt as if it might paralyze me. I tried hard to feel my leg, so I would remember them

260
00:29:27.12 --> 00:29:36.24
long after they were blown off. I was torturing myself. Then I realized that the other men must be

261
00:29:36.24 --> 00:29:44.64
afraid too, yet they kept moving. I was their leader. I had been trained for my job in the best

262
00:29:44.64 --> 00:29:52.000
installations in the US Army had to offer West Point Airborne School Ranger School Jungle War Fair

263
00:29:52.000 --> 00:30:00.000
School. How could I be deficient after such an investment? While my men wrenched from unmilitary

264
00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:05.20
backgrounds into the Army and quickly processed in an impersonal training facilities continued

265
00:30:05.20 --> 00:30:12.96
to do their duty. Somehow I kept moving. I could not allow myself to appear cowardly in the

266
00:30:12.96 --> 00:30:31.36
eyes of those men besides there was no place else to go. That IED Booby trap threat is just horrifying.

267
00:30:33.28 --> 00:30:38.24
And it's scary enough for just being over there when you see the destruction that it causes,

268
00:30:38.24 --> 00:30:44.32
but getting blown up and actually personally stepping on ID and then you're back in the field

269
00:30:44.32 --> 00:30:53.44
three weeks later. In the same area patrolling the same ground. That's courage.

270
00:30:55.68 --> 00:31:04.24
Now is there moving into position on an ambush site. He's getting some stuff from his gear

271
00:31:04.24 --> 00:31:09.84
and here we go back to the book. As I struggled through the undergrowth, the lace called on a branch

272
00:31:09.84 --> 00:31:15.92
and pulled the compass loose from its birth, causing it to fall in the ground where it struck a rock.

273
00:31:17.20 --> 00:31:24.72
The metallic case made a loud ping as it bounced. Without hesitation, I yelled Booby trap.

274
00:31:24.72 --> 00:31:33.44
Lurch to the right through myself to the ground, covered my head with my arms and tried to pull

275
00:31:33.44 --> 00:31:38.000
my legs up to my button, bracefully explosion that was about to rip me apart.

276
00:31:41.44 --> 00:31:44.32
And all the other guys are doing the same thing, diving for cover.

277
00:31:45.44 --> 00:31:51.52
So if you didn't catch that, he was just moving through the brush and something caught on his

278
00:31:51.52 --> 00:31:56.88
compass and pulled it out of its pocket and it fell to the ground and he heard that metallic noise

279
00:31:56.88 --> 00:32:00.80
and he yelled out. I mean, they're on patrol. They're setting up an ambush. So this will be quiet and

280
00:32:00.80 --> 00:32:04.96
tactical and silent and all of a sudden he's yelling out. Booby trap and diving to the ground.

281
00:32:04.96 --> 00:32:14.72
It makes everyone take cover. So they come back from that and he says, I took the time to debrief

282
00:32:14.72 --> 00:32:19.76
the patoon upon reentry to the perimeter, pointing out the strong points and the weak points of the

283
00:32:19.76 --> 00:32:26.56
night's actions. I did not spare myself in the critique. I simply stated what had happened.

284
00:32:27.36 --> 00:32:33.60
I had made a mistake but an honest one. There were a few subdued comments by the patrol members,

285
00:32:33.60 --> 00:32:40.08
all of whom clearly recognized the danger of my action. It didn't matter. I had overcome my fear.

286
00:32:40.08 --> 00:32:45.68
I was once again in control of my patoon and more importantly, myself. So when you make a

287
00:32:45.68 --> 00:32:55.60
mistake on it, that's what you got to do when you make a mistake on it. Back to the book. My indoctrination

288
00:32:55.60 --> 00:33:02.32
period was over. I had been bludded but survived. I had been embarrassed but would recover.

289
00:33:02.88 --> 00:33:08.64
The early shocks had been merciful in that they were over quickly. I could now turn my attention away

290
00:33:08.64 --> 00:33:14.48
from the self-conscious concerns of how I would fit into this alien environment and how I might

291
00:33:14.48 --> 00:33:21.20
be perceived by the soldiers I led. I could concentrate instead upon improving my style of leadership

292
00:33:21.20 --> 00:33:29.76
and fighting the enemy. There was much to do. For too long, the patoon had done only those things

293
00:33:29.76 --> 00:33:37.44
necessary to minimize casualties and approach that in the long run would surely lead to maximum

294
00:33:37.44 --> 00:33:46.72
casualties. So you want to sit back, you want to hide, you're letting the enemy get a drop on you.

295
00:33:47.28 --> 00:33:54.16
And he knows that. You got to take some risk upfront to prevent the long-term extreme risk.

296
00:33:57.20 --> 00:34:04.32
Back to the book. An old army added claims that soldiers only do well that which their commander checks

297
00:34:04.32 --> 00:34:11.04
and combat everything must be done well. Yet I realized I couldn't possibly check everything.

298
00:34:12.32 --> 00:34:18.08
But I could create the illusion that everything was being checked especially if I use the

299
00:34:18.08 --> 00:34:27.36
squad leaders and the patoon sergeants as extensions of my own will. So a little bit of decentralized

300
00:34:27.36 --> 00:34:34.56
commander. He knows he can't inspect everything. He can't be everywhere all the time. But if he uses

301
00:34:34.56 --> 00:34:39.36
proper decentralized command, he can make it happen. Because his leaders, his subordinate leaders,

302
00:34:39.36 --> 00:34:47.68
will make it happen. Back to the book, not only tactics, but all matters relevant to our life

303
00:34:47.68 --> 00:34:53.28
in the field had to be supervised. For instance, health habits had to be inspected as diligently

304
00:34:53.28 --> 00:34:59.36
as weapons were. Soldiers have to be kept clean. They have to shave and watch, wash, and the

305
00:34:59.36 --> 00:35:05.52
squad leader has to see that they do. Soldiers need a place to relieve themselves, a place secure from

306
00:35:05.52 --> 00:35:12.40
both enemy and the disease. Messic women has to be kept clean and soldiers need a balanced diet.

307
00:35:12.96 --> 00:35:18.32
Feet must be cared for. A squad leader is accountable for the changing of socks as he is for the

308
00:35:18.32 --> 00:35:25.44
cleaning of weapons. Men on alert must stay awake no matter how exhausting the preceding hours

309
00:35:25.44 --> 00:35:30.72
have been. Radios have to be monitored, kept dried, and supplied with fresh batteries.

310
00:35:30.72 --> 00:35:36.08
Proper communication procedures must be maintained. Coads must not be compromised.

311
00:35:36.72 --> 00:35:40.72
Positions must be constantly improved. The claymore minds have to be checked,

312
00:35:40.72 --> 00:35:45.68
camouflage, and recamouflaged. Trenches have to be deepened. Firing positions must be made

313
00:35:45.68 --> 00:35:50.08
more lethal to the enemy. Artillery fires must be registered and re-registered.

314
00:35:50.08 --> 00:35:54.96
Grasadiation to the wire must be kept cut. The ammunition bunker has to be kept dry.

315
00:35:54.96 --> 00:36:00.000
Soldiers must rehearse in all combat situations that may be expected of them.

316
00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:03.52
The functioning of the chain of command must be clearly understood by all the men.

317
00:36:04.08 --> 00:36:10.000
In combat, leaders are quickly attrided, and every man in his turn must be prepared to take over the

318
00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:16.96
mission. Lot of stuff to handle. That's why he's saying he can't do all that himself.

319
00:36:17.68 --> 00:36:20.24
You have to use decentralized command in these situations.

320
00:36:23.68 --> 00:36:29.28
Back to the book, I checked positions at night. Every night. I lay behind the machine guns

321
00:36:29.28 --> 00:36:34.40
of the men in the strong points. I checked the frequency of the radio carried by the RTO.

322
00:36:34.40 --> 00:36:40.24
I ate my e-mails at irregular hours, sometimes alone, sometimes with a group of soldiers.

323
00:36:40.88 --> 00:36:46.24
I sat and listened to the men. I studied their manner of speech, their gate. The fact that they

324
00:36:46.24 --> 00:36:52.32
were left or right handed. How soundly they slept. How well they saw in the dark.

325
00:36:53.44 --> 00:37:00.40
I listened to their stories, their hopes, their gripes. I tried not to speak about myself.

326
00:37:00.40 --> 00:37:06.000
They're concerned about me. Was whether or not I could get them through their tour.

327
00:37:06.56 --> 00:37:11.92
They might want to tell me about their homes and their families, but they wanted me to listen,

328
00:37:11.92 --> 00:37:16.24
not talk. They did not want to know about my life away from Vietnam.

329
00:37:16.96 --> 00:37:24.32
I was an officer, and their eyes that made me different. I was a part of this war.

330
00:37:24.32 --> 00:37:35.44
I was one of the they. They drafted the soldier. They trained him. They ordered him to this

331
00:37:35.44 --> 00:37:41.60
god for sake in place, and they sent him out on terrifying missions to be maimed and killed.

332
00:37:42.56 --> 00:37:49.36
They did not have a life other than the army. They were the army.

333
00:37:49.36 --> 00:38:00.40
So I listened and I watched. These men were the prime resource of the platoon.

334
00:38:01.12 --> 00:38:04.96
They would fulfill its missions. They would do their countries bidding.

335
00:38:05.92 --> 00:38:13.12
But they were men first. They were not so many boots on parade. They were human.

336
00:38:13.12 --> 00:38:21.12
They had loves, fears, futures that they hoped to see. They made me wonder.

337
00:38:22.96 --> 00:38:27.76
Was I coming to know them too well to make them do what they had to do?

338
00:38:28.88 --> 00:38:32.24
Or did I not know them well enough to ask them to do it?

339
00:38:32.24 --> 00:38:42.72
I say that all the time. That's one of the misconceptions about the military.

340
00:38:42.72 --> 00:38:48.16
Is that the people that are in the military are people, they're humans.

341
00:38:50.80 --> 00:38:53.20
Not so many boots on parade.

342
00:38:53.20 --> 00:39:04.88
Now he talks a little bit about the enemy. The enemy were also young, also adherents of a

343
00:39:04.88 --> 00:39:11.84
humanistic faith in which killing was not the essence of life. Yet now we face each other.

344
00:39:13.04 --> 00:39:19.60
Obsessed with the idea of killing each other. There was no respite from it.

345
00:39:19.60 --> 00:39:27.04
Once a day I wrote a letter to my wife. It was a moment of sanity snatched from the madness of war.

346
00:39:28.40 --> 00:39:33.68
If anything, my thoughts of home reinforced my desire to stay alive and my determination to keep the

347
00:39:33.68 --> 00:39:41.52
enemy from killing me. They would not kill me. They would not kill my men. We would kill them first.

348
00:39:41.52 --> 00:39:50.32
War is the management of violence claimed the contemporary social scientists and military

349
00:39:50.32 --> 00:39:57.44
strategists as we hacked our way through the struggle of Vietnam. For us, violence was killing.

350
00:39:58.88 --> 00:40:04.96
There was no management involved. People were either dead or they were not.

351
00:40:04.96 --> 00:40:15.12
I could not manage my platoon up a hill. I had to lead them up there. I had a mission to accomplish

352
00:40:15.12 --> 00:40:23.36
and I had men to keep alive as many as I could. I had to do more than keep them alive. I had to

353
00:40:23.36 --> 00:40:31.60
preserve their human dignity. I was making them kill. Forcing them to commit the most uncivilized

354
00:40:31.60 --> 00:40:38.96
of acts. But at the same time, I had to keep them civilized. That was my duty as their leader.

355
00:40:40.56 --> 00:40:47.52
They were good men, but they were facing death. And men facing death can forgive themselves

356
00:40:47.52 --> 00:40:55.04
many things. War gives the appearance of condoning almost everything, but men must live with their

357
00:40:55.04 --> 00:41:03.12
actions for a long time afterward. A leader has to help them understand that. There are lines.

358
00:41:04.24 --> 00:41:11.28
They must not cross. He is their linked normalcy to order to humanity.

359
00:41:12.48 --> 00:41:20.16
If the leader loses his own sense of propriety or shrink from his duty, anything will be allowed,

360
00:41:20.16 --> 00:41:27.76
and anything can happen. Some men in combat will commit war crimes. Just as some men in combat

361
00:41:27.76 --> 00:41:33.20
will fail to take care of themselves. They will experiment with drugs, steel property, abuse,

362
00:41:33.20 --> 00:41:40.08
women. When this happens, it destroys the discipline of a unit making it easier for others to follow suit.

363
00:41:42.08 --> 00:41:50.08
War is at its very core, the absence of order. And the absence of order leads to very easily

364
00:41:50.08 --> 00:41:55.68
to the absence of morality, unless the leader can preserve each of them in its place.

365
00:41:56.96 --> 00:42:01.28
The leader has to set the standards from morality as clearly as he sets the standards for

366
00:42:01.28 --> 00:42:07.44
personal hygiene or weapons maintenance. He must allow no cutting of corners.

367
00:42:08.64 --> 00:42:14.64
A bottle of soda stolen from an old peasant woman leads gradually but directly to the rape of her

368
00:42:14.64 --> 00:42:24.88
daughter if the line is not drawn in the beginning. There's a lot of dichotomy in there.

369
00:42:26.16 --> 00:42:32.000
And this is what I've talked about before. I was making them kill, forcing them to commit the most

370
00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:37.28
in civil-uncivilized of acts, but at the same time, I had to keep them civilized.

371
00:42:37.28 --> 00:42:49.20
And you know another one that I talk about all the time is the fact that you care about your men

372
00:42:52.16 --> 00:43:00.88
more than anything. And yet you have to send them out on missions where they can be

373
00:43:00.88 --> 00:43:07.36
gravely wounded or killed. And so this is what a combat leader is struggling with. This is the

374
00:43:07.36 --> 00:43:20.40
dichotomy of leadership. This was war. This Vietnam involvement and in war, things tend to happen.

375
00:43:21.44 --> 00:43:26.48
But the commander was the link to order and civility and he had to be humane.

376
00:43:26.48 --> 00:43:35.44
At the same time, he had to be uncompromising to protect the lives of all. The job was not easy.

377
00:43:40.88 --> 00:43:44.48
The job was not easy. No sir, it was not.

378
00:43:44.48 --> 00:43:55.76
Now he goes into a chapter that's called a cast of characters where he's describing some of the people

379
00:43:58.32 --> 00:44:08.56
in the Paltoon. Who were the sons that America sent to war? In vain, I looked for the

380
00:44:08.56 --> 00:44:21.76
article Platoon of Romantic fiction. The kid from Brooklyn wasn't there. The Incipant Poet never

381
00:44:21.76 --> 00:44:29.44
made it. The rich mama's boy out to prove his manhood stayed home. As a cross section of America's

382
00:44:29.44 --> 00:44:36.56
youth, the Platoon was a complete failure. So all these typical characters that you see in the movies

383
00:44:36.56 --> 00:44:44.000
and this idea that it's a cross section of America, no, it wasn't. The military draft was never

384
00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:49.12
concerned with equity. Its sole purpose was to obtain the required numbers of men with sufficient

385
00:44:49.12 --> 00:44:56.64
mental and physical qualities to do the job. Since the pool of men from which to draw was much greater

386
00:44:56.64 --> 00:45:01.84
than the numbers needed, a natural selection process allowed the educated and the privilege to

387
00:45:01.84 --> 00:45:09.84
avoid the draft altogether. The selection process continued for the unfortunate drafted so that

388
00:45:09.84 --> 00:45:14.64
those with some education or particular skills would be devoted from combat service.

389
00:45:17.36 --> 00:45:22.24
Even among those who made it to Vietnam, the vast majority never saw combat.

390
00:45:23.52 --> 00:45:29.44
Only those without skill, without schooling, and without friends, or whose or who were

391
00:45:29.44 --> 00:45:36.08
obstinate in the face of ceaseless, proselytizing against their obligation to serve, made it to the

392
00:45:36.08 --> 00:45:47.52
field. And they knew it. Talking about some of the guys here, he's got

393
00:45:48.80 --> 00:45:52.88
guy named Jim Barnes from Asheville, North Carolina who is

394
00:45:52.88 --> 00:46:04.72
good solid operator, got a really bad stutter. Guy named Corp. John Killigan from Baker's field,

395
00:46:04.72 --> 00:46:10.56
California, and he sort of is the throughout the book. He's a guy that is sort of the

396
00:46:11.76 --> 00:46:20.40
model soldier. And he's 22 years old already on his third tour of duty in Vietnam. And by the way,

397
00:46:20.40 --> 00:46:25.20
a tour in Vietnam was a year long. So this guy's so killigan's on his third tour in Vietnam,

398
00:46:25.20 --> 00:46:32.16
most combat experience soldier in the book, too, and everyone respected him. But no one considered

399
00:46:32.16 --> 00:46:40.80
him a friend. The reason was simple why he was so well respected, he was the best soldier among us.

400
00:46:40.80 --> 00:46:46.72
He had the reflexes of a cat. He was a deadly shot and ferocious in a fight. And he never showed

401
00:46:46.72 --> 00:46:59.36
the slightest bit of concern for his own safety. Awesome. There were so many ways to avoid

402
00:46:59.36 --> 00:47:05.28
ending up as a combat infantryman. There were so many of their countrymen who would never

403
00:47:05.28 --> 00:47:12.48
see an all-of-drab uniform or a drill sergeant or the green hell of Vietnam. But each of these

404
00:47:12.48 --> 00:47:20.40
men seemed destined to end up there as if it had been written in granite on the day of his birth.

405
00:47:22.96 --> 00:47:28.96
They did not complain. This is what those guys live with a little bit.

406
00:47:31.28 --> 00:47:36.72
I noticed one day that specialist Barnes turned away when one particularly beautiful girl

407
00:47:36.72 --> 00:47:43.12
walked close to biome as he was clearing a thicket of underbrush away from the wire. The girl's

408
00:47:43.12 --> 00:47:48.56
left arm was missing. Her empty sleeve folded neatly and pinned to her shoulder.

409
00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:57.36
What's the matter Barnes I asked? In his painstakingly slow stutter, Barnes explained that the girl in

410
00:47:57.36 --> 00:48:02.64
her lover were among a group of armed vehicles who walked through one of our ambushes one night.

411
00:48:02.64 --> 00:48:10.40
The ambush was sprung. The boyfriend was killed and the girl's arm was mangled by a bullet.

412
00:48:11.52 --> 00:48:15.12
The girl was evacuated by the Americans but her arm could not be saved.

413
00:48:16.32 --> 00:48:25.20
Eventually she returned to work her fields. What do you say to a girl whose arm you shot off?

414
00:48:25.20 --> 00:48:33.20
Barnes asked me, his stutter clearing for a minute. I could think of no reply.

415
00:48:35.12 --> 00:48:40.08
Now, there's starting to get some intelligence report that there's

416
00:48:40.88 --> 00:48:45.04
ominous forecast that there's going to be some big attacks, some big enemy thrusts,

417
00:48:45.68 --> 00:48:48.72
and he's taking some time to prepare for that.

418
00:48:48.72 --> 00:48:58.56
My targets for improvement were discipline and tactics. The two are closely related. In the heat of

419
00:48:58.56 --> 00:49:03.44
battle there is no time for second guessing the per commander and is necessary for a soldier to

420
00:49:03.44 --> 00:49:09.44
develop an automatic response to an order. Such instantaneous obedience will overcome all fears,

421
00:49:09.44 --> 00:49:16.48
all confusion, all inclinations towards self preservation. It is the result of unmedicated daily

422
00:49:16.48 --> 00:49:24.16
discipline in all things, from taking the daily malaria pill to shaving each day to attacking in the

423
00:49:24.16 --> 00:49:37.76
face of an automatic weapon. I'm adding this to my life, the statement of unmedicated daily discipline

424
00:49:37.76 --> 00:49:50.88
in all things. They're heading out on a patrol and as McDonald heads up the line to inspect some

425
00:49:50.88 --> 00:49:56.72
of the soldiers, here we go to the book. Suddenly there was a hollow sounding explosion in a whistling

426
00:49:56.72 --> 00:50:02.16
past my ear followed by another explosion a second later about 150 meters out in the bushes.

427
00:50:02.16 --> 00:50:10.08
I spun around to see King, one of the guys, King with a sneer on his face. Sorry, L.T.

428
00:50:10.72 --> 00:50:18.56
the words his from his mouth. I dropped my weapon. The grenade launcher dangled from his right hand,

429
00:50:18.56 --> 00:50:26.000
a waft of smoke curling up from the barrel. It was clear that he had fired his 40 millimeter round at

430
00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:33.12
me. At that range, he could not have missed, so he must have meant it as a warning. He was telling

431
00:50:33.12 --> 00:50:38.96
me he did not like my attitude. So he got McDonald who's been imposing discipline and trying

432
00:50:38.96 --> 00:50:44.40
to keep the guy squared away and this guy doesn't like it. And so he sends him a warning shot with

433
00:50:44.40 --> 00:50:53.60
his with his M79 grenade launcher. I was scared, but I was angry too. King had not only threatened

434
00:50:53.60 --> 00:50:58.48
my life, but my authority as well. A few weeks earlier, I might have been overcome by the situation,

435
00:50:58.48 --> 00:51:05.12
but since then I had developed a thick skin necessary for survival in Vietnam. With murder in my eyes,

436
00:51:05.12 --> 00:51:11.52
I looked into King's face. Slowly, deliberately, I walked up to him saying nothing until I was

437
00:51:11.52 --> 00:51:17.68
close enough to touch him. I had made no threatening gesture. Suddenly, when I was close enough

438
00:51:17.68 --> 00:51:23.20
to smell his breath, I flicked my M16 in fire position and placed the muzzle of the weapon

439
00:51:23.20 --> 00:51:29.12
in the cavity of the underside of his chin. He went up on his toes as I increased the pressure of the

440
00:51:29.12 --> 00:51:36.32
rifle barrel, lifting him up against the bottom of his head. The sneer was now on my face,

441
00:51:36.32 --> 00:51:43.20
as I raised my voice, so everyone could hear you son of a bitch. The eyes of everyone in the

442
00:51:43.20 --> 00:51:49.12
pitoon were riveted on us. Drop your weapon again and you better pray to God, it hits me square in

443
00:51:49.12 --> 00:51:53.92
the back because if it doesn't, you bastard, I'll blow your brains to kingdom come.

444
00:51:57.12 --> 00:52:06.24
Not a man stirred, putting down a little rebellion. But again, this is something we...

445
00:52:07.52 --> 00:52:11.92
Well, you knew you think about that. I mean, from my perspective, nothing like that ever came close

446
00:52:11.92 --> 00:52:18.16
to happening me at any time. Was there any time where I ever thought any of my guys would do

447
00:52:18.16 --> 00:52:24.40
anything in any way to hurt me in any situation? In fact, those guys would do anything to save me.

448
00:52:24.40 --> 00:52:28.000
They would never let anything happen to me. And here you have one of your guys that just decides

449
00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:32.72
it's going to give you a warning shot with a 40 millimeter grenade launcher. Because he doesn't like

450
00:52:32.72 --> 00:52:40.96
here added to whatever. They're probably not allowed to do with a lot of those guys didn't want to be there.

451
00:52:40.96 --> 00:52:42.48
Absolutely. Absolutely.

452
00:52:42.48 --> 00:52:55.28
Now they are moving forward on the patrol. They had a little incident happen.

453
00:52:56.96 --> 00:53:04.000
And they find a corpse from the book now. I was becoming fairly accustomed of viewing the

454
00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:10.64
dead, but this cadavir was particularly grotesque. It was the old woman who had cared for the children.

455
00:53:10.64 --> 00:53:16.72
Both her breasts had been half severed from her body, a deliberate cut made on the underside of each.

456
00:53:18.08 --> 00:53:22.96
Each palm in the soul of each foot had been shot through with a small caliber round.

457
00:53:23.84 --> 00:53:29.20
The killing wound, which no doubt had followed the earlier torturous wounds was a blast from a

458
00:53:29.20 --> 00:53:34.08
weapon evidently placed inside her mouth and directed out the back of her head.

459
00:53:34.08 --> 00:53:42.56
Her eyes were open, transfixed and terror. Jabbed into her belly on the end of a straight and

460
00:53:42.56 --> 00:53:49.36
safety pin was a note. Nand the kit Carson scout translated it for me.

461
00:53:51.04 --> 00:53:56.40
To one cow key has been found guilty by the people's court of aiding the American

462
00:53:56.40 --> 00:54:02.08
imperialists and their suppression of the Vietnamese people. As an enemy of the people,

463
00:54:02.08 --> 00:54:07.84
she has been made to pay for her crimes. This is the justice that will be brought to all who

464
00:54:07.84 --> 00:54:12.96
consort with the Americans and aid them in the villainous suppression of our land.

465
00:54:15.44 --> 00:54:16.24
War is hell.

466
00:54:21.20 --> 00:54:25.28
Now, they start to get

467
00:54:25.28 --> 00:54:36.96
attacked inside their perimeter. Then here we go. At that moment, the first rush was made by the enemy.

468
00:54:36.96 --> 00:54:43.20
20 to 30 V at Kong appeared coming at the South Wired Dead Run. I shouted for my men to

469
00:54:43.20 --> 00:54:49.28
shift fire on them. There was no need for my words. My men were responding well. We were getting off

470
00:54:49.28 --> 00:54:56.48
a handheld flare every 30 seconds which illuminated the rushing enemy very clearly. The two machine

471
00:54:56.48 --> 00:55:02.32
guns on that portion of our perimeter barked out of welcome and neat six round bursts. Several of

472
00:55:02.32 --> 00:55:11.28
the enemy fell. Their first rush was stopped in its tracks. It was becoming increasingly clear

473
00:55:11.28 --> 00:55:15.84
that the machine gun was going to be the key weapon in the initial stoppage of the fight.

474
00:55:15.84 --> 00:55:22.32
And I just highlighted that because I know I get a I hear from military guys all the time.

475
00:55:22.32 --> 00:55:29.44
Guys that are overseas and I just wanted to reiterate that. In the fire fight, the machine gun

476
00:55:29.44 --> 00:55:39.12
is the key weapon. Now they're continuing to being attacked and from the southeast of

477
00:55:39.12 --> 00:55:44.32
woman came running toward the break in the wire. She was carrying a bulky object in her arms

478
00:55:44.32 --> 00:55:49.28
but in the flickering light of the flares it was impossible to identify it. Don't fire Lawrence

479
00:55:49.28 --> 00:55:55.04
barked. I was not sure I agreed. If it was a satchel charge that the woman was carrying

480
00:55:55.04 --> 00:56:00.000
she would be able to fling it in and us in another few steps. The explosion would rip apart that

481
00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:07.36
perimeter wide open allowing the enemy to rush through unimpeded. On the other hand if the woman

482
00:56:07.36 --> 00:56:14.56
was seeking help it would be a tragedy to cut her down. As I hesitated the heavy beat of enemy

483
00:56:14.56 --> 00:56:20.16
rounds forced her down. Lawrence made a dash for the wire. Got 10 steps and then went into a low

484
00:56:20.16 --> 00:56:24.64
crawl. Inching is way along. He made it to a break in the wire and came up to the woman.

485
00:56:25.36 --> 00:56:29.92
In her arms was her seven-year-old daughter. The little girl had taken around clean through the

486
00:56:29.92 --> 00:56:37.92
chest along was collapsed and she was bleeding heavily. Her mother was trying to make it to us to save

487
00:56:37.92 --> 00:56:47.20
the child. Again this is the dichotomy of war. You got people torturing and murdering

488
00:56:48.08 --> 00:56:53.84
old women and then you get this situation where there's a woman who's rushing the perimeter

489
00:56:53.84 --> 00:57:00.000
and this guy says she's don't shoot her and then crawls out. Rises life to go and try and find out

490
00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:14.72
what the situation is and help her. There's darkness and there's light. They beat back that attack

491
00:57:16.64 --> 00:57:22.16
and the next morning they go out on patrol. Killigan was the point man on the first patrol

492
00:57:22.16 --> 00:57:26.88
out the morning after the fight. All night he'd worked the machine gun from the southern tip of

493
00:57:26.88 --> 00:57:33.36
the platoon triangle. His steady hand holding the enemy rushes at bay. Early in the fight the

494
00:57:33.36 --> 00:57:37.44
attackers had recognized Killigan's prowess and tried their best to put him out of action.

495
00:57:38.16 --> 00:57:43.12
The sound, the sandbags surrounding his position were torn and poked from the bullets and

496
00:57:43.12 --> 00:57:49.52
shrapnel aimed at his early retirement. He had not flinched throughout the night.

497
00:57:49.52 --> 00:57:57.92
Now he took up the point with the alertness of a well-rested cat. The man seemed indestructible.

498
00:58:05.60 --> 00:58:11.20
Now he starts talking a little bit about the situation that they were in and some moves that he

499
00:58:11.20 --> 00:58:15.04
made and one of the things he did was he kept his forces together at this point when they'd been

500
00:58:15.04 --> 00:58:20.56
attacked or he reunited his forces and he talks about that here. Had the enemy struck while my

501
00:58:20.56 --> 00:58:25.84
meager forces were split, they might have overwhelmed one or both elements piecemeal.

502
00:58:27.12 --> 00:58:33.04
Controlling the separated elements would also have been almost impossible and the subsequent

503
00:58:33.04 --> 00:58:38.88
coordination of outside support such as air strike and armor platoon would have been too hazardous

504
00:58:39.52 --> 00:58:43.92
had we even survived long enough to receive help. So he's talking about again this is just going

505
00:58:43.92 --> 00:58:50.96
out to people that are in the military in the field. Avoid splitting your forces up. Just avoid

506
00:58:50.96 --> 00:58:56.08
something you obviously have to do it but always think about it. Think about the ramifications of it.

507
00:58:56.08 --> 00:59:00.000
When you're split up, number one, you're two elements are weak. That's why when you do split up,

508
00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:04.72
you should stay as often as you can stay within position of mutual support. Where your weapons

509
00:59:04.72 --> 00:59:08.64
can support the other group and you can bring them back to your perimeter or you can attack or

510
00:59:08.64 --> 00:59:12.48
you can flank or you can support them. The other thing that's very difficult when you're split up

511
00:59:12.48 --> 00:59:18.08
is it's very difficult to control what's happening. Because you likely out of verbal range,

512
00:59:18.08 --> 00:59:22.80
you know, could possibly be out of radio range and now now how you can control what's going to

513
00:59:22.80 --> 00:59:27.36
happen. So if you do have to split up, make sure you have very good loss of communication plans

514
00:59:27.36 --> 00:59:31.36
to react to. If something happens, we're going to go to this master point. Here's going to be

515
00:59:31.36 --> 00:59:35.84
the signaling when you come in there. So you've got to think about that. And finally, when you split

516
00:59:35.84 --> 00:59:40.96
your forces up on the battlefield and you lose control of them. Now you can't call for air support.

517
00:59:40.96 --> 00:59:46.000
You can't, it's very difficult to get help and bring the funder that you would want to because you

518
00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:50.96
don't know where everybody is. So when you do have to split for, so what you do absolutely have to

519
00:59:50.96 --> 00:59:55.92
do sometimes avoid it as much you can. And then when you have to plan for the worst case scenario.

520
00:59:55.92 --> 01:00:04.16
So that you're ready for it. Now they're back to kind of sorting things out after this

521
01:00:04.16 --> 01:00:11.76
hardcore battle when they, when the VC attacked. My eyes returned to the bodies laying so lying

522
01:00:11.76 --> 01:00:19.60
so neatly in line. Why did we line them up anyways? Was it a pension for neatness and attempt to

523
01:00:19.60 --> 01:00:27.44
bring some orderlyness to the disorder of death? It was so absurd. I remembered reading somewhere

524
01:00:27.44 --> 01:00:32.64
that in World War II the Germans had lined up the bodies of American prisoners they'd massacred.

525
01:00:32.64 --> 01:00:42.80
Disorder and order, barbarity and civility. Civility. Ironic juxtapositions in the affairs of

526
01:00:42.80 --> 01:00:49.60
men, again, we're just talking about dichotomy of war. Myelation was reduced to a sense of

527
01:00:49.60 --> 01:00:57.04
insignificance by the cold, brown look of the corpses sprawled in the bright sunlight. A few hours

528
01:00:57.04 --> 01:01:04.96
ago each one had been a dynamo of a human spirit, hope, and ambition. Now they were still their

529
01:01:04.96 --> 01:01:13.20
motion frozen at least in that last instant of life as if making a mockery of the final effort.

530
01:01:15.20 --> 01:01:21.12
They had become meaningless clumps of earth forever in an animate, no more significant than the

531
01:01:21.12 --> 01:01:28.24
rocks lying to their left and right. How fickle those human ambitions now seemed, how pointless

532
01:01:28.24 --> 01:01:35.68
those concerns. And just as the bodies had become part of the earth on which they rested,

533
01:01:35.68 --> 01:01:52.32
so I had passed during the battle from being in the war to being part of the war.

534
01:01:53.44 --> 01:02:00.88
Continuing on, the fog of war is pervasive. As vigilant as I tried to be, I knew it was only a

535
01:02:00.88 --> 01:02:06.88
matter of time before a mistake was made. There were six squads to control as well as the armored

536
01:02:06.88 --> 01:02:13.92
cavalry puttune and the still dischointed RF gaggle. Moreover, Vietnamese regular army units were

537
01:02:13.92 --> 01:02:21.60
infringing on my area. As puttune leader, I had the problems of the rich. Too many resources to

538
01:02:21.60 --> 01:02:28.56
coordinate in a limited area of operations. The ingredients for a tragedy were brewing, and so he had

539
01:02:28.56 --> 01:02:33.84
been augmented with some cavalry guys, with more potuctions, or sorry, more squads to help

540
01:02:33.84 --> 01:02:38.80
mounts. And now he's got a bunch of people there. He had 30 before. Now he's got a lot more.

541
01:02:40.64 --> 01:02:49.84
And there's patrols or happening. Things are going on. And we start getting a call of potential

542
01:02:49.84 --> 01:02:58.16
enemy out and outside the wire. And he's checking his map. And he's going back and forth on the

543
01:02:58.16 --> 01:03:01.68
radio. Hey, is that we have any friendlies in that location. Nope. No friendlies there. Check with

544
01:03:01.68 --> 01:03:05.52
the other guys. Nope. We had no friendlies there. So no one's in that area. No. There's no

545
01:03:05.52 --> 01:03:09.76
friendlies in that area. Okay. God, he's checking his map. He's going back and forth. And now we go

546
01:03:09.76 --> 01:03:16.56
back to the book. All checks had been made. The squads still had the moving element in sight. The

547
01:03:16.56 --> 01:03:23.68
decision was now mine. Take them under fire with the sniper. Then open up, shoot to kill.

548
01:03:23.68 --> 01:03:29.84
The last statement seemed pointless. We always shot to kill, but it reflected my troubled

549
01:03:29.84 --> 01:03:36.16
thoughts over the risk I was taking. The enemy just did not go that way. But no friendlies were

550
01:03:36.16 --> 01:03:42.96
reported anywhere near us. It had to be the enemy. So here's the one shot. The sniper go out.

551
01:03:42.96 --> 01:03:48.48
Then he hears massive gunfire go out. You can probably tell where this is heading.

552
01:03:48.48 --> 01:03:54.16
And then a phranic voice scream from my radio ceasefire. Sees fire. My God, you're killing us.

553
01:03:56.08 --> 01:04:02.24
I was horrified as I grabbed the handset and barked my order 2121. This is 26 ceasefire. Over.

554
01:04:03.52 --> 01:04:07.04
They had heard the original plea. And even as I spoke, the melee quieted.

555
01:04:08.40 --> 01:04:12.32
Again, the radio spoke. You sons of bitches. They're dead. They're dead.

556
01:04:12.32 --> 01:04:23.36
So in the confusion in the fog of war, they'd seen some guys. And obviously they turned out

557
01:04:23.36 --> 01:04:29.60
to be friendly. And they engaged them. Over the next 30 minutes, they get the debrief of what's

558
01:04:29.60 --> 01:04:35.36
happening. It was American advisor was out there with a Vietnamese platoon. One of his guys were dead

559
01:04:35.36 --> 01:04:45.28
and two were badly wounded. Then here's how he felt about that. I had ordered the execution

560
01:04:45.28 --> 01:04:50.56
of those men because the lieutenant advisor had made a mistake. By the way, they were 2,500

561
01:04:50.56 --> 01:04:54.16
meters off course. So they should not have been in that area. And when they were hearing,

562
01:04:54.16 --> 01:04:56.96
they were hearing on the radio. Hey, is there any friendlies out there? And they thought there's

563
01:04:56.96 --> 01:05:04.16
no way that anyone could be talking to us right now. But it happens. And a man should not be

564
01:05:04.16 --> 01:05:12.16
condemned to death for it. In war, however, the price from mistakes is deer and terribly final.

565
01:05:13.36 --> 01:05:18.80
Military leaders must weigh effects of their decisions carefully before because usually

566
01:05:20.48 --> 01:05:21.76
there is no turning back.

567
01:05:21.76 --> 01:05:34.80
That that blue on blue, that fratricide thing. It's a real thing. It's a real thing. I've lived

568
01:05:34.80 --> 01:05:41.20
through it myself. I've been in charge when it's happening. It's awful. And it's real.

569
01:05:42.40 --> 01:05:51.36
And so everybody that's out there that soldiers, Marines, special ops guys, train for that.

570
01:05:51.36 --> 01:05:56.16
Get that make yourselves, make your leadership. Make everyone as keen few as you can as what's

571
01:05:56.16 --> 01:06:04.000
happening so that you force yourselves to think and understand and over communicate where people are,

572
01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:08.24
what positions they're going to, what positions they're leaving, who's where on the battlefield.

573
01:06:09.52 --> 01:06:11.20
The fog of war is no joke.

574
01:06:11.20 --> 01:06:24.32
Now there's another attack that they that they pushed back and they kind of forward it early on by

575
01:06:25.20 --> 01:06:32.08
by catching someone that was going to, that was inside. There was going to try and get inside their

576
01:06:32.08 --> 01:06:37.12
compound. They catch that person. And here we go to the book. Their plan must have been to

577
01:06:37.12 --> 01:06:41.68
rupture our defense with a tremendous blast from the ammunition bunker and then rush it us from the

578
01:06:41.68 --> 01:06:49.12
eastern flank with the five sappers while we were still daysed. The sappers were armed only with

579
01:06:49.12 --> 01:06:55.76
fragmentation grenades. But they had plenty of them. Later we took 49 grenades from their bodies.

580
01:06:56.48 --> 01:07:02.56
One of the sappers, a young muscular man who in life would have epitomized the propaganda stereotypical

581
01:07:02.56 --> 01:07:10.96
revolutionary, but who in death appeared like so much wasted clay, was dressed only in a loincloth.

582
01:07:12.24 --> 01:07:17.76
Folded within that single article of clothing was a small piece of paper upon which was drawn

583
01:07:17.76 --> 01:07:24.96
or rough but accurate sketch of our perimeter defense. The first link in their plan had been

584
01:07:24.96 --> 01:07:30.40
destroyed by the capture of the infiltrator and was further deteriorated by the annihilation of the

585
01:07:30.40 --> 01:07:37.84
sapper force. But the vehicle were never noted for their flexibility and they continued to press

586
01:07:37.84 --> 01:07:43.44
forward according to their original plan. However, instead of meeting daysed, dying and demoralized

587
01:07:43.44 --> 01:07:48.16
defenders, the enemy rushed right into the protective fires of already enabled platoon.

588
01:07:49.20 --> 01:07:54.32
Because of a slight twist of fortune over which the vehicle had no influence, the attackers went to

589
01:07:54.32 --> 01:08:00.72
their death rather than the victory that night. This is the second time we've heard that,

590
01:08:00.72 --> 01:08:06.88
is just the the Viet Kong not being very flexible, not being very adaptable with their plan.

591
01:08:08.48 --> 01:08:14.56
So once again, if you're in a leadership position, you've got to maintain flexibility with

592
01:08:14.56 --> 01:08:17.68
your plan, whether you're in a combat operation or whether you're in a business world,

593
01:08:18.40 --> 01:08:24.16
it doesn't matter. Maintaining flexibility is absolutely paramount in from a leadership perspective,

594
01:08:24.16 --> 01:08:38.24
and from a team perspective. Now, after that attack, they move out to go for a counter attack,

595
01:08:38.24 --> 01:08:45.76
which is just, let's think about this. You're in your perimeter, you get attacked. They had a person

596
01:08:45.76 --> 01:08:52.16
that infiltrated and almost made it into the main ammo bunker that you have. They almost blew that up.

597
01:08:52.16 --> 01:08:57.12
And then their second thing was to have these the sappers, these soldiers crawling through the

598
01:08:57.12 --> 01:09:04.48
wire with 40 something grenades with them to go and jack stuff up. You push back, you repel this

599
01:09:04.48 --> 01:09:11.52
attack, and then guess what? The time for a counter attack. So here he is, as the back of the book,

600
01:09:11.52 --> 01:09:15.84
as the squad lined up for the exit through the wire, I looked at their young faces, tightened to

601
01:09:15.84 --> 01:09:22.16
stifle the fear building up inside their bodies. They were barely men, yet called upon by their

602
01:09:22.16 --> 01:09:28.000
country and abandoned by their more well-to-do peers, about to face a ruthless enemy who meant to

603
01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:36.64
put them in their early grave. No words of complaint from any of them. They were American infantry

604
01:09:36.64 --> 01:09:43.04
men, and would do the job they were asked to do. No matter what, no matter that it would not be

605
01:09:43.04 --> 01:09:46.88
appreciated. No matter that they would be condemned by their countrymen or at least the

606
01:09:46.88 --> 01:09:53.92
countrymen with the ability to wear with all to mold public opinion. Tonight they would do their duty.

607
01:09:55.52 --> 01:10:00.24
Though they were little more than boys, though they were frightened, though they were most

608
01:10:00.24 --> 01:10:08.56
not ready to die, they would do their duty. Most of them were labeled as coming from the lower social

609
01:10:08.56 --> 01:10:16.80
strata of American society, as if that were something in noble. I felt proud to be with them

610
01:10:16.80 --> 01:10:23.68
and glad to share their company. Their qualities of moral and physical courage of unselfice

611
01:10:23.68 --> 01:10:30.16
dedication to each other amid the difficult jobs they were called upon to do mark them in my mind

612
01:10:30.16 --> 01:10:43.60
as among the noblest of human beings. So they're out on this counterattack. I mean, what a great

613
01:10:43.60 --> 01:10:56.80
tribute to the American soldier. Unbelievable, unbelievable dedication and pride, unbelievable men.

614
01:10:56.80 --> 01:11:07.04
Now they, they're patrolling out in front of them. They hear some whispers and whispers out in

615
01:11:07.04 --> 01:11:13.76
front of them. We're either patrolling towards and they're trying to figure out what to do and it sounds

616
01:11:13.76 --> 01:11:20.08
like McDonald's Sorosant. Hey, let's just kill these guys. There's bad guys up ahead. We're

617
01:11:20.08 --> 01:11:27.84
out there whispering and kill again. Tugs of the Zarm and says, stay here. Like, I'm going to go

618
01:11:27.84 --> 01:11:35.68
check this out. He basically says, you know, we shouldn't, we shouldn't kill these people. And

619
01:11:35.68 --> 01:11:42.40
he McDonald gets kind of pissed because he's taking a look. This isn't the time for us to debate

620
01:11:42.40 --> 01:11:51.52
right now. I want to make a decision. And he says, kill again in one of his real moments of speech,

621
01:11:52.24 --> 01:11:56.80
he has to let me check it out first. So kill again doesn't talk much. He gets it done.

622
01:11:59.12 --> 01:12:04.24
So he creeps forward, you know, and he was basically saying, look, I'm going to go on alone.

623
01:12:04.24 --> 01:12:09.52
Like, are you just let me take my chances? I'm not putting anybody else at risk. Just me.

624
01:12:09.52 --> 01:12:12.80
And so he decides, okay, go ahead. You want to take you on a risk your life.

625
01:12:14.16 --> 01:12:19.92
And so he kill again disappears into the darkness and then a little while later he comes back.

626
01:12:19.92 --> 01:12:23.44
It's cool. And we'll go to the book here. Then it's quite easy. Crup to away.

627
01:12:23.44 --> 01:12:29.60
Kill again reappeared from the darkness. He crawled up to my face and said, it's okay. Let's move on.

628
01:12:30.40 --> 01:12:35.92
What were the voices? I asked. Family was his one more response.

629
01:12:35.92 --> 01:12:41.84
I passed the word to hold fire and the file began moving. We moved out of position and through

630
01:12:41.84 --> 01:12:47.60
the brush to our front. There huddled in a hole that must have been used as a household garbage dump.

631
01:12:48.24 --> 01:12:53.52
We're two aged women and old man, one young woman, and four tiny children.

632
01:12:54.64 --> 01:13:01.20
The elderly people had shy and bearous smiles on their faces. The children stared in sheer terror.

633
01:13:01.20 --> 01:13:09.12
Well, they might. I had nearly killed them all. The sight of the family was haunting.

634
01:13:11.60 --> 01:13:18.40
I and others like me are trained in commission to lead men into actions that determine life and death.

635
01:13:19.60 --> 01:13:24.08
Our authority, particularly on the field of battle, is virtually unquestioned.

636
01:13:24.08 --> 01:13:32.24
We were tasked to lead men like Kill again to tell them what should be done and what they must do.

637
01:13:33.12 --> 01:13:37.76
We have no obligation to listen to their point of view. Indeed, to do so,

638
01:13:38.56 --> 01:13:44.000
might be in itself or cause to occur a failure of leadership.

639
01:13:45.60 --> 01:13:51.44
And yet, the American soldier is often much more prepared than his leader to make a sound

640
01:13:51.44 --> 01:13:56.96
determination of what should be done. Kill again's approach had been wiser than mine.

641
01:13:56.96 --> 01:14:01.28
I was too preoccupied with my own safety and the safety of my men to consider that there might have

642
01:14:01.28 --> 01:14:07.60
been a non-combatant in the area. I had come to the most basic of battle field strategies.

643
01:14:07.60 --> 01:14:13.28
Shoot now and ask questions later. A thousand times I might have been able to rationalize that

644
01:14:13.28 --> 01:14:20.40
course of action after the fact. But I had gone, but had I gone ahead this time that people huddled

645
01:14:20.40 --> 01:14:24.80
now whole would have been dead, nothing but rotting corpses by the heat of the next day.

646
01:14:25.84 --> 01:14:31.28
That they were alive was no thanks to me. It was to kill again's credit.

647
01:14:32.32 --> 01:14:37.44
And he was just a quote, lowly American infantrymen.

648
01:14:41.12 --> 01:14:48.64
So once again, just credit to the trooper, to the soldier. And you can see there's this is

649
01:14:48.64 --> 01:14:53.20
some of the things that he talked about that we have no obligation to listen to that

650
01:14:53.20 --> 01:14:58.24
point of view. That's something that you can see he's maturing out of.

651
01:14:58.24 --> 01:15:05.28
And this paragraph is a visible evidence of him transitioning from, hey, look, I'm the boss.

652
01:15:05.28 --> 01:15:10.32
I'm in charge, do what I say to you know what, these guys know better than I do in many cases.

653
01:15:10.88 --> 01:15:14.64
And that's from a leadership perspective. That's a very important lesson to learn.

654
01:15:14.64 --> 01:15:18.32
And the soon you learn it the better off you're going to be. The people that you're leading

655
01:15:18.32 --> 01:15:23.44
oftentimes know the situation, the job, the technicalities better than you do.

656
01:15:24.96 --> 01:15:31.44
So rely on them, count on them, ask their opinion. And the fact of the matter is when you

657
01:15:31.44 --> 01:15:37.28
don't ask their opinion, it's only because you're insecure about your leadership, ability and your

658
01:15:37.28 --> 01:15:50.08
position. And by not asking, you actually, you actually develop less respect than if you say,

659
01:15:50.08 --> 01:15:55.52
hey, you know what, kill again? You've been here. This is your third-torn Vietnam. What do you

660
01:15:55.52 --> 01:16:01.44
think we should do here? You will not lose respect, leaders, you will not lose respect if you

661
01:16:01.44 --> 01:16:07.44
ask that question. In fact, you lose respect when you don't respect your frontline trooper,

662
01:16:07.44 --> 01:16:12.24
when you don't use their talent, when you don't take advantage of their expertise, that's when you go

663
01:16:12.24 --> 01:16:30.88
backwards. Listen to your troopers. So he gets, he gets pulled back to command. They assign

664
01:16:30.88 --> 01:16:37.28
him to like a mixed match unit of a bunch of random squads because they have a certain mission that

665
01:16:37.28 --> 01:16:43.92
they want him to do. And they've gone out and they've set up a perimeter. Now, if you don't know

666
01:16:43.92 --> 01:16:49.36
security perimeter, it's basically 360 degree security perimeter of where you're, you have guns pointed

667
01:16:49.36 --> 01:16:54.08
to the outside and you have usually the leadership will be in the center of the perimeter. And then

668
01:16:54.08 --> 01:16:58.48
we small teams kind of out in the perimeter making up the perimeter. So that's the position that

669
01:16:58.48 --> 01:17:04.88
they're in. He's got these random squads that he's never worked with before and he's in charge of them.

670
01:17:04.88 --> 01:17:10.64
Again, this is something where we did have to work with Iraq, he's on my last appointment, but oftentimes

671
01:17:10.64 --> 01:17:14.48
you're working with other seals. These guys, you know, guys, you know, I'm really well,

672
01:17:14.48 --> 01:17:17.68
you know everything they're going to do. And here you are, getting thrown into a combat environment

673
01:17:17.68 --> 01:17:21.76
on a very dangerous patrol into enemy territory that you don't know very well. And you've got a bunch

674
01:17:21.76 --> 01:17:30.72
of guys that you never worked with before. So as he's in that perimeter, he's given the guys some

675
01:17:30.72 --> 01:17:36.64
instructions about something called challenge and replies. So it's a way of confirming,

676
01:17:36.64 --> 01:17:40.32
because this is pitch black. These guys don't have night vision. It's pitch black. He says, hey,

677
01:17:40.32 --> 01:17:46.24
if you hear someone coming, you can issue the challenge for a number sum of 10, which is like,

678
01:17:46.24 --> 01:17:52.24
if I say echo, or if I hear you coming and I say seven, you would respond three. If I say four,

679
01:17:52.24 --> 01:17:57.20
you would respond six. So they've they've passed that word. If you hear noise, you need to challenge,

680
01:17:57.20 --> 01:18:02.96
do that challenge or reply. So he's out there and he's crawling towards one of the little

681
01:18:02.96 --> 01:18:06.56
elements on the outside of the perimeter so he can find out, you know, checking with them,

682
01:18:06.56 --> 01:18:11.52
see if they've seen anything, see if they heard anything. And here we go, back to the book.

683
01:18:11.52 --> 01:18:19.12
Shhh, was his only warning to the others. I came to a complete rest waiting for someone to issue

684
01:18:19.12 --> 01:18:26.08
the challenge. The seconds ticked on, but I heard no sound. I began to sense there was a problem.

685
01:18:27.20 --> 01:18:33.44
The next sound was the bolt and firing pin of a rifle sliding forward in response to a pulled

686
01:18:33.44 --> 01:18:40.88
trigger. Both fell forward on an empty chamber. Terrified, I realized that I should be dead,

687
01:18:40.88 --> 01:18:47.28
that the rifleman meant to nail me no questions asked. Only as earlier error and not having

688
01:18:47.28 --> 01:18:52.88
chambered around saved me. Don't shoot, I shouted in hard. It's the lieutenant.

689
01:18:53.68 --> 01:18:59.36
But I was too late to stop the momentum of events. I heard a panicky remark from the midst of the

690
01:18:59.36 --> 01:19:06.08
group, get the bastards, then around was chambered. As I flung myself at the sound, 15 feet

691
01:19:06.08 --> 01:19:12.000
is not far to sprint, but the journey seemed endless. I threw myself parallel to the ground

692
01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:17.20
and lunged in the dark figure appearing before my eyes. As I launched through the ear,

693
01:19:17.20 --> 01:19:23.36
I felt round switched by my outstretched body. Nine or ten bullets burning out of the barrel

694
01:19:23.36 --> 01:19:29.20
of the automatic weapon. My arms circled the knees of the fire or bringing him down in a heap.

695
01:19:29.20 --> 01:19:33.52
I pushed the hop barrel skyward as the last of the rounds exited the weapon.

696
01:19:33.52 --> 01:19:39.68
Although I had pinned the fire, I had also to think about the two other men with him. I yelled

697
01:19:39.68 --> 01:19:44.96
out, don't shoot, you son of a bitch, it's the platoon leader. There was no further firing.

698
01:19:45.68 --> 01:19:53.44
Fighting my rage, I tried to focus my thoughts. We were in deep trouble. Don't shoot, don't shoot.

699
01:19:53.44 --> 01:19:59.60
I hold your fire. I shouted across a perimeter. I could hear nervous chatter from all around,

700
01:19:59.60 --> 01:20:08.24
so he barely escaped. He gets the guys to stop. He doesn't even really, he's mad, but he's

701
01:20:09.12 --> 01:20:13.92
basically taking responsibility in being in this situation in the first place.

702
01:20:15.28 --> 01:20:21.52
So he says to the guys that were there. He says, I had modest all three men to challenge correctly,

703
01:20:21.52 --> 01:20:26.08
speaking to them as if I were giving a classroom instructions to a bunch of eager if not very

704
01:20:26.08 --> 01:20:32.88
bright students. I surprised myself with my calmness. It was when I moved back to my position that

705
01:20:32.88 --> 01:20:38.72
the greatest struggle within me began. Perhaps it was triggered by the decision I had to make

706
01:20:38.72 --> 01:20:46.16
by the book I shifted, I had shifted our positions. By the book I should have shifted our positions.

707
01:20:46.16 --> 01:20:52.24
We were reconnaissance patrol. We were badly outnumbered by the enemy and it compromised our position

708
01:20:52.24 --> 01:20:58.96
with all the shooting and shouting. There were good reasons for moving. On the other hand,

709
01:20:58.96 --> 01:21:04.000
it was pitch black night. If the enemy was close enough to get an immediate fix on us,

710
01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:09.68
he was close enough to hit us before we could move. Even if he wasn't close, further stumbling

711
01:21:09.68 --> 01:21:16.16
around in the darkness might worsen our predicament. Moreover, to affect the movement,

712
01:21:16.16 --> 01:21:21.60
I would have to move around to regroup the dispersed men. This was the point that weighed most

713
01:21:21.60 --> 01:21:28.40
heavily on my mind. I no longer had the heart for it. I had come within an inch of being killed,

714
01:21:28.40 --> 01:21:32.80
shot by one of my own men on the side of an ink black mountain in the middle of nowhere.

715
01:21:33.68 --> 01:21:38.16
I knew the men were ready to shoot anything that moved and I didn't want to give them a target.

716
01:21:40.32 --> 01:21:44.88
I should have been ashamed of myself. I was too afraid to move to implement rules,

717
01:21:44.88 --> 01:21:48.96
probably the best course of action for my men and my mission. I couldn't do it.

718
01:21:48.96 --> 01:21:55.44
Naked fear strips. Me of all shame or guilt. Fear was all I knew.

719
01:21:56.000 --> 01:22:00.64
And I didn't want to move. A few moments earlier, I had been an effective

720
01:22:00.64 --> 01:22:06.40
patoon leader doing his job. Now I could actually feel my chest throbbing against the dirt where I lay.

721
01:22:07.12 --> 01:22:11.76
I wanted to bury my face in my hands. I wanted to be like the little boy I used to be hiding

722
01:22:11.76 --> 01:22:18.56
from the darkness by putting his head under the covers. I could not think. My body began to tremble.

723
01:22:18.56 --> 01:22:24.24
Then shiver. Then shake uncontrollably. My God, I was going to die. I could not possibly live

724
01:22:24.24 --> 01:22:29.76
through the night. If anyone heard my breathing, I was sure you'd kill me. Death was everywhere.

725
01:22:29.76 --> 01:22:36.72
I sensed it. I felt that lying down beside me. I didn't want to die, but death was there.

726
01:22:36.72 --> 01:22:44.88
Cold and clammy, reaching for me with his icy touch. My pulse pounded in my ears and I felt nauseous.

727
01:22:44.88 --> 01:22:52.72
I almost threw up. The passing minutes, hours, whatever units of time exist in a nightmare brought

728
01:22:52.72 --> 01:22:59.76
no relief. The fear only worsened. I would not live through the night. I was sure of it.

729
01:23:01.04 --> 01:23:05.52
With the dying hurt, I wondered what I disappeared into nothingness.

730
01:23:07.20 --> 01:23:12.48
When I first went prone, trying to press myself into the ground, I fell close to an ant hill.

731
01:23:12.48 --> 01:23:17.68
A few of the ants scouts immediately began a reconnaissance of my body, but it was not until

732
01:23:17.68 --> 01:23:24.000
the ants' legions were called forward that I noticed them. As I lay, shaking on the ground,

733
01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:29.84
thousands of ants began trupping over me, adding to the crawling feeling on my flesh.

734
01:23:31.44 --> 01:23:37.76
Still, I did not move. For the move, I knew, would put me in the embrace of death. So I lay there

735
01:23:37.76 --> 01:23:43.76
where I was, heart pounding, skin sweating, ears throbbing, while an army of ants probed and

736
01:23:43.76 --> 01:23:45.36
pricked at my will.

737
01:23:48.08 --> 01:23:53.04
Sometime later, that night the rains came in a torrential downpour that sent a stream

738
01:23:53.04 --> 01:23:59.44
gushing down the mountainside at us. I still didn't move. My night of terror was not over yet,

739
01:23:59.44 --> 01:24:04.80
and when the rain stopped after a few hours, I still lay in the ooze and slime.

740
01:24:04.80 --> 01:24:12.16
The first light brought a sense of recovery. Darkness was ending, and I was still alive.

741
01:24:13.36 --> 01:24:19.92
Only then did the beating of my heart slow. I loosened my belt, reached down into the

742
01:24:19.92 --> 01:24:24.72
soggy elastic of my undershorts, and wiped out a streak of drowned ants.

743
01:24:26.16 --> 01:24:30.88
The rains had swept them over my body, where they had become trapped, and they had drowned.

744
01:24:30.88 --> 01:24:39.20
As I removed their dead bodies, thousands of them, I seemed to rid myself of my fixation with death.

745
01:24:40.96 --> 01:24:46.16
I had lived through the night, vulnerable as I was. The ants had died,

746
01:24:46.16 --> 01:24:52.40
eminently adaptable as they were. Somehow, the irony of it reassured me.

747
01:24:52.40 --> 01:25:04.80
One died when it was time to die. Apparently, it was not my time. As Dawn broke, I pulled

748
01:25:04.80 --> 01:25:09.28
myself together, gathered up my makeshift patrol, and moved back toward the Ranger camp.

749
01:25:10.80 --> 01:25:17.12
That night on the mountain, instead of engaging the enemy, I'd come to grips with my own mortality.

750
01:25:17.12 --> 01:25:26.16
That night, I had been a terrible, platoon leader. But perhaps I would be a better one thereafter

751
01:25:26.72 --> 01:25:35.12
because of it. A little bit of an intense evening, for Lieutenant McNona.

752
01:25:37.12 --> 01:25:45.36
Unbelievable. Now, he gets some, and throughout this book,

753
01:25:45.36 --> 01:25:50.80
there's, and I talked about this in the beginning, that there's rotations of guys.

754
01:25:50.80 --> 01:25:55.36
And guys are getting wounded. Guys at time, for them to go home, so you're constantly, he's constantly

755
01:25:55.36 --> 01:26:02.64
getting new troopers, new soldiers, new non-commission officers that are going to be the senior

756
01:26:02.64 --> 01:26:09.60
guys inside the platoon. And it's just a constant stream of incoming new guys, which again,

757
01:26:09.60 --> 01:26:14.96
is very foreign to me because in the sealed teams, we do very little of that. We do do it sometimes,

758
01:26:14.96 --> 01:26:20.24
for guy-graduates sealed training, and they happen to be assigned a team that's on deployment.

759
01:26:20.64 --> 01:26:26.24
They, they might come over and join us on deployment. It can't happen, but it's not, it's not the norm.

760
01:26:28.80 --> 01:26:33.04
So he's got a new guy that shows up who's a staff sergeant, an empallamman,

761
01:26:34.08 --> 01:26:39.52
and, and, pallamman's like almost 40 years old, he'd cross the Canadian board,

762
01:26:39.52 --> 01:26:50.48
the Canadian border, to join the Canadian army. And he'd spent time in the British army in

763
01:26:50.48 --> 01:26:57.36
Cyprus. He'd been chasing war, basically. And it's slightly under six feet tall, not an ounce of

764
01:26:57.36 --> 01:27:04.000
fat on his lean frame, determined look. And this is quite contrary to the guys he had been working with.

765
01:27:04.96 --> 01:27:09.28
And here he talks about that a little bit. With Hernandez and Robinson, I had to push to get them

766
01:27:09.28 --> 01:27:17.76
patrolling. With Pallaman, I had to hold him back. He believed firmly that the only good defense

767
01:27:17.76 --> 01:27:24.40
was a good offense. And he was ready to set the example every day. Not only did he take himself out on

768
01:27:24.40 --> 01:27:28.96
as many patrols as I would permit, he invariably pushed seated to the front of the column,

769
01:27:28.96 --> 01:27:36.24
eventually threatening to displace the point man. He exhibited such enthusiasm when he and I went

770
01:27:36.24 --> 01:27:40.24
on longer patrols that I had to order him back to the back of the column,

771
01:27:40.24 --> 01:27:46.40
less I find myself trailing him. He never meant disrespect. He just wanted to be upfront where the

772
01:27:46.40 --> 01:27:51.52
action might be. Pallaman was the perfect between sergeant.

773
01:27:56.96 --> 01:28:04.56
You're definitely blessed when you get it, when you get a leader like that in your command.

774
01:28:04.56 --> 01:28:10.80
And I was definitely lucky enough to serve with many guys with that kind of attitude that I had

775
01:28:10.80 --> 01:28:21.44
to hold back. Here's an interesting thing. He says during the war, we lost approximately 10,000 men

776
01:28:21.44 --> 01:28:27.36
to other than enemy fire. The anomalous so full of treachery danger and outright bad luck

777
01:28:27.36 --> 01:28:34.88
that he's on this administrative mission and he just like playing it safe. Because he isn't

778
01:28:34.88 --> 01:28:40.08
want to die, he's going to get killed by a criminal or getting a car accident, but you don't think

779
01:28:40.08 --> 01:28:43.84
about 10,000 people dying to be an ob just from other than combat.

780
01:28:47.84 --> 01:28:50.64
The heavy rain to discourage the enemy from moving against us.

781
01:28:50.64 --> 01:28:57.68
That was some comfort. Obviously they were human after all. Too often they seemed to

782
01:28:57.68 --> 01:29:02.32
above the constraints of normal men too hardened to the rigors that wore down the rest of us.

783
01:29:03.52 --> 01:29:07.12
Although it was tempting to rest on our haunches, taking advantage of the

784
01:29:07.12 --> 01:29:12.48
respite offered by the weather, I knew that in the long run it would be safer to push more on

785
01:29:12.48 --> 01:29:19.44
the offensive. To lie back would only allow the enemy to build their strength as I was building

786
01:29:19.44 --> 01:29:27.60
mine and allow them to choose the time and place of the next strike. I decided to go after them

787
01:29:27.60 --> 01:29:34.16
in their lair. One of the personnel changes I made was to take Killigan out of his squad leader

788
01:29:34.16 --> 01:29:40.72
physician. A sergeant arrived to take over the squad. I passed word to him to keep Killigan off

789
01:29:40.72 --> 01:29:46.56
point. Killigan did not like it and was close to the point of rebellion, but I refused to put him back

790
01:29:46.56 --> 01:29:52.08
on point. His luck was about to run out. No matter how good he might be, the odds are heavily

791
01:29:52.08 --> 01:29:59.44
stacked against the point man. My order, however, meant little. In variably, Killigan would move

792
01:29:59.44 --> 01:30:06.24
up to the front always out there a little advance of the moving element. It was a role he defined

793
01:30:06.24 --> 01:30:14.40
for himself. So obviously we're going to continue one of the themes of this book is be aggressive

794
01:30:14.40 --> 01:30:19.68
and stay on the offense. That's absolutely true. The reason I highlighted that thing with Killigan

795
01:30:20.32 --> 01:30:24.72
is because here you got a guy that's all about good order and discipline. But guess what? He's

796
01:30:24.72 --> 01:30:29.04
telling Killigan don't walk point, don't walk point, don't walk point. Killigan goes, okay,

797
01:30:29.04 --> 01:30:34.48
yeah, I won't walk point. Goes out on patrol goes up to point. That's also one of those things where

798
01:30:34.48 --> 01:30:38.48
you know, sometimes I get asked, you know, my boss is not doing this or we're not getting,

799
01:30:38.48 --> 01:30:42.48
we're getting a, we're not getting clear direction or I don't agree with this thing. Sometimes

800
01:30:42.48 --> 01:30:47.20
you got to make some stuff happen. You know, especially if it's the right thing to do,

801
01:30:47.20 --> 01:30:55.04
you got to make some stuff happen sometimes. Now they do some some operations and

802
01:30:56.56 --> 01:31:02.56
they're starting to take some toll on the enemy and here's what the enemy does. The enemy

803
01:31:02.56 --> 01:31:10.08
retaliated with more booby traps and other regular attacks. One morning the village chief was caught

804
01:31:10.08 --> 01:31:17.04
at the well as he bathed his ever present 45 caliber pistol left a few feet away with his pile of

805
01:31:17.04 --> 01:31:24.64
clothes. A small nine year old boy, no doubt acting on orders from a relative walked up,

806
01:31:24.64 --> 01:31:32.24
smiled and shot the chief twice with a 22 caliber pistol. Once again, however, the chief survived

807
01:31:32.24 --> 01:31:38.56
returning a few weeks later to resume his post. Specialist Barnes back from six days in Australia

808
01:31:38.56 --> 01:31:43.60
stepped on a booby trap and lost his right leg at the hip. Rob's in the nervous baby face

809
01:31:43.60 --> 01:31:49.52
kid from Illinois who had arrived at Palman got wedged head first in a Vietcong tunnel as he was

810
01:31:49.52 --> 01:31:56.24
clearing it. He panicked, vomited and drowned in his own puke before he could be pulled back out.

811
01:31:57.44 --> 01:32:02.72
Another man recently arrived sat down beside a trail to take a break and trip the Chinese

812
01:32:02.72 --> 01:32:10.64
claymore with his butt. I hope his mother would not ask to open his coffin. The gruesome

813
01:32:10.64 --> 01:32:16.08
toll of the booby traps wore on our nerves. No matter how many we found we knew there were others

814
01:32:16.08 --> 01:32:22.08
out there waiting for a missed step. The terror built is one thing to rush an enemy in battle and

815
01:32:22.08 --> 01:32:27.20
take your chances in the face of his firepower. The experience is frightening but the momentum of the

816
01:32:27.20 --> 01:32:33.60
act compels you forward, sparing you the agony of considering your predicament. Thinking your way

817
01:32:33.60 --> 01:32:38.48
through a booby trap there is completely different experience and much more harrowing.

818
01:32:40.48 --> 01:32:45.68
Moving along you suddenly notice a freshly smooth spot of dirt to your front. You look hard and see

819
01:32:46.24 --> 01:32:52.000
the three deadly prongs of the anti-personnel mind come into focus and unholy trinity extending

820
01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:58.56
from beneath the surface of the earth to greet your footfall and rip you apart. You look to your

821
01:32:58.56 --> 01:33:04.000
right and see a pile of rocks or intertwined twigs the vehicle on warning to their own that this is a

822
01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:09.60
killing ground. You order everyone to freeze as you strain your eyes to pick out more booby trap

823
01:33:09.60 --> 01:33:16.000
clues, your nerves have turned to steel coils. Your eyes dart over the ground for tethail signs

824
01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:23.28
of human tampering smooth dirt and unnaturally placed vine attached to a pole pin safety. A thin

825
01:33:23.28 --> 01:33:30.40
wire across your path, a broken brush, time stand still. You're afraid to move at the same time you

826
01:33:30.40 --> 01:33:35.92
want to duck your head and dash to safety. Maybe you can make it before the detonation catches you.

827
01:33:36.64 --> 01:33:44.000
But one of the others you have to get them all out. Keep cool. That's it. Bring the others slowly

828
01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:50.08
into a straight file. Careful. Watch where you step. Now work your way up to the front.

829
01:33:50.08 --> 01:33:56.64
Look carefully before each footfall. Watch for nearly invisible wires. One slight tug could

830
01:33:56.64 --> 01:34:04.88
bring metal tearing through your flesh like a frenzyed power saw. Okay, let's move. Stay in line.

831
01:34:04.88 --> 01:34:11.92
Don't bend chup. Can't let one booby trap get more than one of us but which one? Me, him, concentrate.

832
01:34:11.92 --> 01:34:18.000
Don't think about the explosion. Look, look, you can see them if you look carefully enough. Take

833
01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:24.08
another step. We're almost out of it. Christ don't ambush us. Now we can't move. Concerns and

834
01:34:24.08 --> 01:34:31.76
trait. Think of where you would plant them. Look for the telltale signs. And so it went.

835
01:34:32.80 --> 01:34:38.80
Tremendous pressure followed by Tremendous relief as the booby trap area was cleared.

836
01:34:38.80 --> 01:34:44.08
Then the journey continued only to bring the patrol to another threatening area.

837
01:34:45.28 --> 01:34:51.68
It played on your nerves. Somehow the men put on a show of bravado.

838
01:34:53.68 --> 01:35:00.80
I thought that section. Talking about getting ID. I mean that's like what it's like. It was just a

839
01:35:00.80 --> 01:35:06.000
perfect, perfect writing and being on out of patrols where you think and there's going to be

840
01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:10.000
ID's. That's what your mind is thinking. That's what you're thinking. You're looking at every little

841
01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:14.48
thing in the road, every little piece of trash, every little wire, everything could be a pressure

842
01:35:14.48 --> 01:35:19.84
plate. It could be a crush wire. It could be an ID. Could just be anything. And so you're just

843
01:35:19.84 --> 01:35:25.36
constantly in that mode of assessing and looking and trying to figure it out. And I thought that

844
01:35:25.36 --> 01:35:31.20
that was an incredible job, especially by a guy that actually triggered an ID on himself and got blown

845
01:35:31.20 --> 01:35:39.76
up. And so he's probably feeling that that pressure 10 fold. A leader who arbitrates when the

846
01:35:39.76 --> 01:35:45.20
laws of land warfare are overtaken by pragmatic concern is trading on dangerous ground.

847
01:35:46.08 --> 01:35:53.28
The laws exist for practical and humane reasons and I knew that well. But the consequences of

848
01:35:53.28 --> 01:35:58.64
my decisions were immediate and I could not afford the comfort of a philosophical debate on issues.

849
01:35:58.64 --> 01:36:05.68
I tried to behave in a humane manner and did not intimidate. But I persist until I was reasonably

850
01:36:05.68 --> 01:36:13.44
assured that I had the truth or that my interviewie truly did not know. I owed my men that much.

851
01:36:15.76 --> 01:36:21.52
One day a stay behind ambush element got into a sudden firefight in the exchange. One American

852
01:36:21.52 --> 01:36:26.40
had been hit in the leg and was bleeding profusely. As I approached the action with the rest of the

853
01:36:26.40 --> 01:36:32.08
troll and tending to flank the enemy, I noticed that the base of the hill we are about to send was

854
01:36:32.08 --> 01:36:37.44
heavily mined. A frightened farmer crouching the grass nearby. Come here, Papa Sonna called

855
01:36:38.08 --> 01:36:43.60
non, ask him how to get through this stuff. The farmer shook his head and dismay. A call came

856
01:36:43.60 --> 01:36:48.08
on the radio. Damn it if we don't get archable about it, here fast, he's going to bleed to death.

857
01:36:48.08 --> 01:36:59.04
Asm again, damn, I ordered again the farmer refused. His eyes widening in fear. I took out my knife.

858
01:36:59.84 --> 01:37:05.52
Man, tell him I'll kill him right now if he doesn't tell us. I had crossed the line.

859
01:37:06.24 --> 01:37:11.68
I wouldn't have killed him but he didn't know that. And the threat itself was criminal.

860
01:37:12.64 --> 01:37:17.28
But I weighed that against the bleeding soldier and the others who might bleed if we didn't get

861
01:37:17.28 --> 01:37:24.72
through to them quickly. A leader has no one to look to for advice on such decisions. He must

862
01:37:24.72 --> 01:37:29.92
do what he thinks is best but he must not fool himself as to the consequences of his choice.

863
01:37:31.20 --> 01:37:35.76
War is not a series of case studies that can be scrutinized with the objectivity.

864
01:37:36.48 --> 01:37:42.64
It is a series of stark confrontations that must be faced under the most emotion-wrenching conditions.

865
01:37:42.64 --> 01:37:50.96
War is the suffering and death of people you know set against a background of the suffering and death

866
01:37:50.96 --> 01:37:59.20
of people you do not. That reality tends to prejudice the already tough choices between morality and

867
01:37:59.20 --> 01:38:07.84
pragmatism. The farmer let us through. We force the enemy away and extract it our soldier in time

868
01:38:07.84 --> 01:38:17.28
to save his life. We let the farmer go but not before I thank him. He looked at me as if I were crazy.

869
01:38:21.92 --> 01:38:28.56
Very enough to just say again this is another great description of what you're dealing with in

870
01:38:28.56 --> 01:38:37.92
war and the decisions that you have to make in these horrible situations. Back to the book, Fricker was nervous.

871
01:38:38.72 --> 01:38:44.64
For the past few days he felt his number was coming up. I don't know what's wrong with me lieutenant.

872
01:38:44.64 --> 01:38:50.16
He had told me shyly I don't feel right. What do you mean? Are you feeling sick? I asked,

873
01:38:50.64 --> 01:38:56.88
no it's not that I just feel down like something bad is going to happen.

874
01:38:56.88 --> 01:39:03.60
Maybe you've been on point too often. I'll tell Staff Sergeant Robinson to take you off. No,

875
01:39:03.60 --> 01:39:09.84
no don't do that. I'm the best man for that my squad. I don't want any of the guys thinking I'm yellow.

876
01:39:12.24 --> 01:39:18.88
Fricker wasn't yellow. He was scared but he was more scared of letting his friends down than

877
01:39:18.88 --> 01:39:27.28
of getting hurt. I urged him to take a break but he had insisted on staying on point. I told Robinson

878
01:39:27.28 --> 01:39:33.04
to take him off anyway. Fricker heard of it and pleaded with me to put him back. I yielded.

879
01:39:34.56 --> 01:39:40.08
So on a lovely evening Fricker was cautiously leading the squad up a hill and the machine gun

880
01:39:40.08 --> 01:39:47.28
stitched him across the chest. Robinson turned and dashed down the slope making it 20 meters before

881
01:39:47.28 --> 01:39:53.76
he stumbled and broke his ankle. Ten meters behind Fricket, nail and a Wilson do for cover.

882
01:39:55.68 --> 01:39:59.76
Fricker went down on one knee and spun around to face his friends.

883
01:40:02.16 --> 01:40:08.32
Blood and air bubbled from the holes in his chest. He dropped his weapon and tried to

884
01:40:08.32 --> 01:40:15.04
rise his arms out stretched as if reaching for help. His eyes open wide and tear his mouth

885
01:40:15.04 --> 01:40:22.72
a gap as blood spilled over his loose lower lip. As the machine gun bullets tore into his back,

886
01:40:22.72 --> 01:40:28.08
he tumbled face down arm still reaching out for help. That would come too late.

887
01:40:30.48 --> 01:40:36.16
Wilson took in the scene with horror. Fricker's dead, my god, Fricker's dead. His voice rose above

888
01:40:36.16 --> 01:40:41.84
the clatter. A freight that no one understood Wilson repeated his announcement to him. No, he's dead.

889
01:40:41.84 --> 01:40:49.28
He's dead. He yelled with all his might. Nail silence them with a Kurt shut up. He's dead.

890
01:40:49.84 --> 01:40:55.76
And that's all there is to it. Somehow nails words cut through the hideousness of the moment

891
01:40:55.76 --> 01:41:02.56
more graphically than Fricker's death. Wilson was stunned into silence. There was a cursory exchange

892
01:41:02.56 --> 01:41:06.64
of rounds. The enemy fled down the reverse slope and Fricker's corpse became the

893
01:41:06.64 --> 01:41:16.24
war and the lame robins were evacuated. Nail became the squad leader. That was all there was

894
01:41:16.24 --> 01:41:24.88
to it. Another American had fallen. One of more than 58,000 to die in Vietnam.

895
01:41:29.44 --> 01:41:34.48
The action took a few minutes. There was nothing unique about it. A messy business to be sure.

896
01:41:34.48 --> 01:41:38.88
But one that could be cleaned up by shipping off the body and making a few personnel changes.

897
01:41:40.64 --> 01:41:47.36
But Fricker was dead. A few moments earlier. He had been a young man with a lifetime of

898
01:41:47.36 --> 01:41:54.88
experience as a head of him. Now he was just a memory to his family and to us. A few moments earlier

899
01:41:54.88 --> 01:42:02.88
he was afraid some of his friends would think of him as a coward. Soon, almost no one would think

900
01:42:02.88 --> 01:42:11.20
of him at all. His mother would get a telegram and then a purple heart. Maybe I could write him up

901
01:42:11.20 --> 01:42:20.88
for a medal. But what should I say? That he was brave because he was afraid to be afraid.

902
01:42:22.80 --> 01:42:29.44
That he saved a squad by walking up to the machine gun first and what did he save them for?

903
01:42:29.44 --> 01:42:34.80
So that they might live a few more weeks before following in his footsteps.

904
01:42:37.12 --> 01:42:43.76
It was all too much to consider. His nail had said he was dead.

905
01:42:45.76 --> 01:42:55.76
And that's all that was to it. Here he talks a little bit about the morality of war. It was not

906
01:42:55.76 --> 01:43:02.80
a simple matter of killer be killed. I had to think of my men. I could not let them be killed

907
01:43:02.80 --> 01:43:10.88
because of a rigid morality on my part. But if I compromised with that morality too often,

908
01:43:10.88 --> 01:43:18.16
I would become little more than a war criminal unfit to lead those men's. I had to struggle to

909
01:43:18.16 --> 01:43:27.12
keep a sense of balance. That's the crazy thing about the dichotomy of leadership. Is that these

910
01:43:27.12 --> 01:43:33.20
opposing forces that are pulling you in two different directions? They're both correct. It's

911
01:43:33.20 --> 01:43:37.84
correct. They're both correct and the balance is where you need to stay. I shouldn't say that

912
01:43:37.84 --> 01:43:43.20
they're both correct, but they're both viable options. You can rationalize either one of them.

913
01:43:44.16 --> 01:43:46.80
You can rationalize, hey, we shouldn't do anything at all. Let's just stay inside the

914
01:43:46.80 --> 01:43:51.36
wire. Let me protect my guys. You can rationalize that. You can rationalize, hey, let's go out

915
01:43:51.36 --> 01:43:56.72
and kill everybody before they kill us. And what you have to do is a leader in a combat situation.

916
01:43:56.72 --> 01:44:01.04
You have to balance those dichotomies. And you know, you could translate that into businesses.

917
01:44:01.04 --> 01:44:04.56
Because in a business, you've got to take care of your people, but you've got to make money.

918
01:44:07.36 --> 01:44:11.76
So there's all these, when you're in a leadership position, there's opposing forces that are

919
01:44:11.76 --> 01:44:16.56
pulling it you and you have to balance them. And you have to pay attention because what happens is

920
01:44:16.56 --> 01:44:21.44
suddenly you start going too far in one direction or the other and you start to re- start to lose control.

921
01:44:21.44 --> 01:44:24.64
Where you start to see things go sideways. That's when you do say yourself, wait a second.

922
01:44:24.64 --> 01:44:28.16
Am I going too far in one direction right now? That's probably what is happening.

923
01:44:31.28 --> 01:44:38.08
Now, here we go. This is just a quick little interlude they had. They had acquired a

924
01:44:38.08 --> 01:44:44.72
60 millimeter mortar. And they were training with it. And one of the guys was wanting to train

925
01:44:44.72 --> 01:44:48.24
it. They didn't really let them use it too much even though he was excited to try it out.

926
01:44:48.96 --> 01:44:52.64
And they end up getting attacked and the only guy that's in for the vicinity of the mortar to use it

927
01:44:53.20 --> 01:44:59.12
is this guy, Spangler. And so he attempts to fire the mortar and he screws it up

928
01:44:59.12 --> 01:45:03.12
a bunch of times and the VC end up getting away.

929
01:45:05.68 --> 01:45:10.40
And McDonald says, dejectively, I scout, I scout at Spangler.

930
01:45:10.40 --> 01:45:18.08
Who felt absolutely terrible about the whole of the fair? I knew it wasn't his fault. It was mine.

931
01:45:18.96 --> 01:45:24.96
I had failed to train him even though he was eager to learn more ownership right there from

932
01:45:24.96 --> 01:45:36.72
McDonald. Now, this is just a shocker in the book and it's one of those situations

933
01:45:36.72 --> 01:45:43.04
which is going to really this, how does this even happen? McDonald decides that they're actually

934
01:45:43.04 --> 01:45:50.000
by the ocean. There are a couple miles from the ocean. And they all have their skin. They have

935
01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:54.96
jungle rot, their skin. They get little infections. They got bug bites and they're just all jacked up

936
01:45:54.96 --> 01:46:00.000
from this, from just living in this environment. And he knows, he says, you know, if we get these

937
01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:03.68
guys to patrol down to the ocean, they can take us from the ocean and get out in the sun,

938
01:46:03.68 --> 01:46:10.88
dry some of their wounds off or what have you. So they go down there, he puts together the plan.

939
01:46:10.88 --> 01:46:16.000
He actually has to ask the guys to go. Because they're saying, you know what,

940
01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:24.000
I'd rather sit here and just have bad skin than go out and have to do another patrol just to go

941
01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:28.16
swimming. And he kind of convinces a couple guys, hey, there's a couple guys that want to go. There's

942
01:46:28.16 --> 01:46:35.12
a couple guys that say, you know, I'd rather not go. He convinces the guys to go. He puts together a

943
01:46:35.12 --> 01:46:39.84
plan. He wants to send some strong squimmers with the group. He's actually pretty aware of the

944
01:46:39.84 --> 01:46:47.36
danger of the ocean. He sends the guys down there. They get down there. And two of the guys

945
01:46:47.36 --> 01:46:57.84
drown and die. And again, we're going to hear some ownership here. James was the guy that was

946
01:46:57.84 --> 01:47:05.12
running the patrol. And McDonald says, I could not criticize James. He had not followed my instructions,

947
01:47:05.12 --> 01:47:12.08
but the fault was mine, not his. I had built the idea into a plan and then ordered its execution.

948
01:47:12.08 --> 01:47:22.48
And in so doing, I had executed Spangler and Evans. I felt a hundred years old. No tragedy in that

949
01:47:22.48 --> 01:47:29.68
God forsaken country had hit me so hard. It was my fault. I was the cause of two deaths in the

950
01:47:29.68 --> 01:47:37.76
name of good intentions. I had talked those men into dying. I staggered under the thought, the cost

951
01:47:37.76 --> 01:47:43.44
of leadership and finally been too high. And I couldn't bear it. I didn't consider myself fit to

952
01:47:43.44 --> 01:47:52.64
lead. But the job was mine. And I couldn't quit for better or worse. I had to do it.

953
01:47:55.12 --> 01:48:02.56
They get back to camp and Wilson, who is good friends with Evans. One of the guys that had

954
01:48:02.56 --> 01:48:09.36
drowned, he says Wilson was crying. The loss of Evans's close friend had deeply affected him.

955
01:48:10.16 --> 01:48:15.92
Asshamed of his tears, he hunkered down behind his machine gun at the strong point on the south side

956
01:48:15.92 --> 01:48:25.20
of the perimeter. I spoke of Evans' goodness and tried to draw from that a benevolent interpretation

957
01:48:25.20 --> 01:48:31.92
of his death. Evans was a piece now I told Wilson. He was no longer part of this nightmarish war.

958
01:48:32.88 --> 01:48:38.16
Although I couldn't follow the logic of my own words, they seemed to lighten Wilson's load.

959
01:48:39.52 --> 01:48:44.000
He began to talk. Together we groped for meaning and a man's death.

960
01:48:45.28 --> 01:48:50.08
I did my best to conceal my own skepticism and agreed with everything he said.

961
01:48:50.08 --> 01:48:58.32
Somehow we came to the conclusion that Evans' death was a good thing. It must be good if God

962
01:48:58.32 --> 01:49:05.04
willed it. By then I wasn't sure who is consoling whom. Sometimes words aren't important for

963
01:49:05.04 --> 01:49:11.36
their content, but only for there being said. And whatever we said that night seemed to be good enough

964
01:49:11.36 --> 01:49:17.84
for both of us. Although I couldn't excuse myself for the drownings, I realized that I owed it

965
01:49:17.84 --> 01:49:22.40
not only to Wilson, but the whole of the town to put the incident behind me.

966
01:49:25.44 --> 01:49:29.68
Now the next situation that they're in, they're doing an assault.

967
01:49:31.36 --> 01:49:34.80
And as they get through these, they're assaulting all mine through a target area.

968
01:49:34.80 --> 01:49:40.32
And as they assault all mine through this target area, there's a vehicle

969
01:49:41.12 --> 01:49:45.36
and his weapon had been smashed by around and he wasn't able to fight and so he just surrendered.

970
01:49:45.36 --> 01:49:50.000
And this guy, NAN, who I mentioned this guy, NAN before this NAN is a Vietnamese guy. That's a

971
01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:54.88
word. That's a translator interpreted. They call him Kit Carson Scouts. They know that they know

972
01:49:54.88 --> 01:50:01.68
the area. They speak the language. And so he says, ask him if he's got any buddies on flank security.

973
01:50:01.68 --> 01:50:08.16
I instructed NAN. A rush of Vietnamese words and sued only to be answered by no-beck

974
01:50:08.16 --> 01:50:12.000
and American Vietnamese slang version of, I don't understand.

975
01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:17.60
God damn it. He's speaking Vietnamese to you, answer him. I shouted in the prisoner's face.

976
01:50:18.48 --> 01:50:23.04
NAN asked him again, the man's face, the man turned his face away defiantly.

977
01:50:24.24 --> 01:50:29.76
My anger was rising after my worries of the night before about finding a way to the target

978
01:50:29.76 --> 01:50:34.80
and the successful attack that followed everything could be overturned by an arrogant,

979
01:50:34.80 --> 01:50:43.20
by the arrogance of one prisoner. Killigan, seeing the way my face was flushed, made the quiet

980
01:50:43.20 --> 01:50:52.80
comment. Don't be mad, Lieutenant. He's just a soldier. Same as you and me. Damn him. He was right.

981
01:50:54.64 --> 01:51:00.80
I would hope to do the same if I were in the shoes of a captive of the captive. Killigan,

982
01:51:00.80 --> 01:51:06.64
the quiet man who dissed out all pretence of leadership once again made me aware of the fragile

983
01:51:06.64 --> 01:51:18.40
superiority of my own leadership. And then as they proceed on, they take these captured guys

984
01:51:20.24 --> 01:51:25.52
and they bring them back to the company command post and we'll go back to the book.

985
01:51:25.52 --> 01:51:28.64
At the end of the morning's fight, we linked up with the rest of the company,

986
01:51:28.64 --> 01:51:34.72
essentially a reinforced platoon that had comprised the blocking force. I turned over our prisoners

987
01:51:34.72 --> 01:51:40.32
to the platoon leader, a young journalist first action, who I later found out did not last another

988
01:51:40.32 --> 01:51:45.76
two weeks. Predictedably, the company commander had stayed back at the base.

989
01:51:47.68 --> 01:51:50.000
Bring the go, bring the gooks over to the CP,

990
01:51:50.000 --> 01:52:00.24
Lieutenant pastor to my sergeant. They aren't gooks, I said quietly. They're soldiers just like you and me.

991
01:52:02.32 --> 01:52:07.52
For a moment, I thought I saw Killigan's eyes flash. Then we started our journey home.

992
01:52:09.52 --> 01:52:13.76
They're going to go on up company sized operation, which means they're taking multiple

993
01:52:13.76 --> 01:52:18.88
platoons of which McDonald's is one of the platoon commanders. And the company commander

994
01:52:18.88 --> 01:52:26.32
was named Moray and Moray calls them all together to do brief and Moray. I haven't talked about

995
01:52:26.32 --> 01:52:31.20
this much, but Moray is kind of a guy that's, he's not real proactive in getting out in the field.

996
01:52:31.92 --> 01:52:36.64
So he's sort of staying back on base, he's a little nervous about the situation.

997
01:52:38.08 --> 01:52:42.88
And this is just a great example. And then he's got the other platoon commanders who you

998
01:52:42.88 --> 01:52:48.56
kind of hear his judgment on them. But this is a great display of leadership of taking

999
01:52:49.28 --> 01:52:58.16
ownership up and down the chain of command and two his peers. So, here we go from the book.

1000
01:52:58.16 --> 01:53:02.72
The plan would put Moray, who's the company commander, 2,000 meters away from our present location

1001
01:53:02.72 --> 01:53:08.40
and 4,000 meters away from the objective. I tried to conceal my disdain.

1002
01:53:08.40 --> 01:53:14.64
Sir, request permission to control the operational movement of the new resources in the initial phase

1003
01:53:14.64 --> 01:53:20.80
of the operation. I spoke with one. I hope with a totally expressionless face. So he's saying

1004
01:53:20.80 --> 01:53:23.92
listen, boss, you're going to be way over there. Why don't I just go ahead and control this?

1005
01:53:26.24 --> 01:53:31.12
The boss says, sure, Jim, I guess that makes sense. You're the senior lieutenant among the platoons.

1006
01:53:31.12 --> 01:53:37.52
Did you have a plan in mind? Moray was easy and I was going to take advantage of it. Boom.

1007
01:53:38.96 --> 01:53:43.84
I briefed him on my concept, my concept routes of movement where we would set up,

1008
01:53:43.84 --> 01:53:47.92
time of anticipated contact with the enemy and types of weaponry, wooden carry.

1009
01:53:48.88 --> 01:53:54.08
The captain concurred with the plans, then excused himself. I've got to get back to the CP and

1010
01:53:54.08 --> 01:54:01.12
report to Battalion. Seeing an opportunity for complete freedom of action, I continued. Sir,

1011
01:54:01.12 --> 01:54:05.68
I need to flesh out the details with the other platoon leaders. May I brief them in your absence?

1012
01:54:06.56 --> 01:54:12.72
Yes, certainly. Carry on. He left as we stood up to salute. So, you see what just happened. How

1013
01:54:12.72 --> 01:54:18.96
beautiful that was? He took total control. And not only did he take control up the chain of

1014
01:54:18.96 --> 01:54:25.68
command, but he's going to get some control over the pierves as well. And he's judging and passing

1015
01:54:25.68 --> 01:54:30.56
judgment on the way the other platoons are running there. The way the other platoon commanders

1016
01:54:30.56 --> 01:54:36.24
are running their platoons. And he says, observing all this, I silently wrote Lieutenant Smalley

1017
01:54:37.76 --> 01:54:43.52
out of the plan. If he could not exercise minimum control in the defense, he would surely fall

1018
01:54:43.52 --> 01:54:49.68
apart in the attack. Lieutenant Evans, first platoon's leader was anxious. He had been on the job

1019
01:54:49.68 --> 01:54:54.96
only a week and this was his first operation. He was a tall, good-looking boy from the Midwest,

1020
01:54:54.96 --> 01:55:01.28
but I felt he was too eager. He was disappointed to be standing pat for the night as the reserve

1021
01:55:01.28 --> 01:55:07.36
unit. But the call had been marae's not mine. Perhaps who's unfair of me to make snap

1022
01:55:07.36 --> 01:55:13.12
judgments of others and then plan my actions on the bases of those judgments. The thought bothered

1023
01:55:13.12 --> 01:55:18.64
me, but not enough to deter me. I was in the business of evaluating people and the traits of

1024
01:55:18.64 --> 01:55:24.16
other men would determine my own fate and that of my soldiers. Presumptuous though my role may have

1025
01:55:24.16 --> 01:55:31.60
been, I had to make judgments and act accordingly. Marae was timid, Smalley was weak, Evans was

1026
01:55:31.60 --> 01:55:40.16
eager. I did not condemn them for that. I noted it and adjusted. We were in a war, not a community

1027
01:55:40.16 --> 01:55:47.92
social. Just great leadership example of how you lead up and down the chain of command.

1028
01:55:50.32 --> 01:55:56.56
So now, I'll actually about to head out on this on this operation. About 50 meters short of the

1029
01:55:56.56 --> 01:56:02.96
forward of the stream, Killigan Dog Leg to the West and brought us up on the trail. The heavy

1030
01:56:02.96 --> 01:56:08.000
labor and the bush brought beads and swept to my forehead and concentrated on our present movement,

1031
01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:12.48
leaving thoughts of the night operation for later. We were soon in the treacherous position of

1032
01:56:12.48 --> 01:56:18.80
doubling back on a previously-used route, always dangerous tactic. For a second, I considered yelling

1033
01:56:18.80 --> 01:56:23.76
at Killigan to get off the trail, but we were so close to the Ford that by the time we maneuvered

1034
01:56:23.76 --> 01:56:28.96
off the trail, we would have been at the crossing site. As Killigan moved ahead and his stealthy

1035
01:56:28.96 --> 01:56:34.88
glide, I saw him freeze momentarily and then glanced to his left directly into a bush overlooking

1036
01:56:34.88 --> 01:56:40.72
the trail. I knew in an instant that we were an eminent danger for Killigan never made a

1037
01:56:40.72 --> 01:56:46.32
abrupt moves except at the movement of conflict, except at the moment of conflict. Killigan turned

1038
01:56:46.32 --> 01:56:52.40
back to us, his face contorting as if to shout a warning. I yelled ambush and dove to my left.

1039
01:56:53.04 --> 01:57:00.08
Killigan took a grenade blast in the face at point blank range. At the same time, sergeant james

1040
01:57:00.08 --> 01:57:05.52
went down with his bullet in his shoulder. The enemy was spraying us from a position across the

1041
01:57:05.52 --> 01:57:10.96
rice patty, Killigan and I had hit a Killigan, had hit a command detonated booby trap.

1042
01:57:13.04 --> 01:57:18.32
I pressed my face into the dirt as bullets wind over my outstretched body. I calculated that

1043
01:57:18.32 --> 01:57:24.48
the best at best, they were only four of us were left. I peaked out from under my helmet to see

1044
01:57:24.48 --> 01:57:30.000
james struggling to get off the trail, the red blotch widening in his dark green fatigue. He was

1045
01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:35.84
moving not into the bushes but toward Killigan, who is lying face down in the patty with a blast

1046
01:57:35.84 --> 01:57:42.88
at knocked him, his blood turning the yellowish water red. Within minutes if he was still alive,

1047
01:57:42.88 --> 01:57:53.92
Killigan would drown. So they get Killigan out of that situation, they get back to their base,

1048
01:57:54.48 --> 01:58:02.80
they go back again to do the ambush, they're hit again on the ambush, they evacuated guy,

1049
01:58:02.80 --> 01:58:14.40
they move again and now they're in the final moment where they are going to do this big

1050
01:58:14.40 --> 01:58:19.12
ambush as part of the company. So this is kind of what this last section of the book is leading to.

1051
01:58:20.88 --> 01:58:27.44
It is morning, and so there are actually the through in the final movement into the ambush position.

1052
01:58:27.44 --> 01:58:34.72
It is morning and there is a grime agrimnus in the drizzling air. Silent figures move to the

1053
01:58:34.72 --> 01:58:41.76
west, shoulders bent under equipment loads, buckles taped for silence, camouflage paint smeared on

1054
01:58:41.76 --> 01:58:51.92
top faces. Gools in the night, young boys really, from places like Valdoista, San Diego,

1055
01:58:51.92 --> 01:59:01.12
Bolther, Madison, Portland, out to kill Asian boys who are out to kill them. The gears of war

1056
01:59:01.12 --> 01:59:08.32
grind together unrelentingly, mechanisms in motion that will catch up human flesh as they mesh.

1057
01:59:09.20 --> 01:59:17.04
Society's clash, politicians deal, diplomats debate, young men struggle to the death.

1058
01:59:17.04 --> 01:59:25.60
Tomorrow or the next day, mothers will receive the news and cry, but nothing will stop the

1059
01:59:25.60 --> 01:59:37.76
morning's killings. They finally get to their ambush site and now the ambush is about to happen.

1060
01:59:38.40 --> 01:59:43.76
Simultaneously, another group of enemy walks into the third ambush site. It is tripped in all the

1061
01:59:43.76 --> 01:59:49.76
enemy are killed. The first group of three hears the melee and panics. One darts back.

1062
01:59:49.76 --> 01:59:57.52
Nan, the old scout catches him with a round on the side. He falls in the old man finishes him

1063
01:59:57.52 --> 02:00:04.000
with two rounds in the head. Two of the enemy scramble through Sergeant Don's position and are hit.

1064
02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:10.16
One falls dead. The other scampers into the brush. Don pursues.

1065
02:00:10.16 --> 02:00:17.60
The wounded enemy ducks into a hole in the ground. Obviously he is familiar with the territory.

1066
02:00:17.60 --> 02:00:23.60
In Vietnamese, Don yells from to come out. There is no reply. Don yells again.

1067
02:00:24.32 --> 02:00:31.92
Bullets spray out of the hole. Don lubs a grenade. Dirt leaves and flesh fly out of the opening

1068
02:00:31.92 --> 02:00:39.04
in front of the blast. Don throws a second grenade. A death rattle rass from the hole.

1069
02:00:40.32 --> 02:00:46.96
Sergeant Don looks around for the newest soldier. Spodding an 18 year old, he sends him in. A safe

1070
02:00:46.96 --> 02:00:52.000
way to harden the youngster toward the events and store for him during the year to come.

1071
02:00:53.20 --> 02:00:58.96
The youth emerges dragging the Viet Kong behind him. It's a gruesome site.

1072
02:00:58.96 --> 02:01:10.24
The man's face knows mouth eyes are gone. Air is sucked into the hole where the nostrils

1073
02:01:10.24 --> 02:01:18.56
used to connect. The jelly-like mass rising and falling in bubbles. Woundscape everywhere on his body.

1074
02:01:19.68 --> 02:01:26.08
There is nothing we can do for him. It would be inhumane to prolong his agony.

1075
02:01:26.08 --> 02:01:31.84
They accomplished that ambush and they are continuing to press the enemy.

1076
02:01:34.16 --> 02:01:42.000
But something that McDonald didn't count on. Something that he couldn't have predicted

1077
02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:50.32
or that he failed to predict. Back to the book, but I underestimated the ruthlessness of our enemy.

1078
02:01:50.32 --> 02:01:57.68
I failed to realize the extent to which political ideology can displace human morality.

1079
02:01:58.80 --> 02:02:06.08
It was a major oversight and it cost us the village of Trong Lamb. Trong Lamb is the village

1080
02:02:06.08 --> 02:02:10.16
that they were actually their permanent was next to this whole time. I should have gone over

1081
02:02:10.16 --> 02:02:15.12
that right in the beginning. But Trong Lamb is the village that they were there to protect. They were

1082
02:02:15.12 --> 02:02:21.44
there to protect these villagers and keep them safe and keep the veot Kong and the communist out of the

1083
02:02:21.44 --> 02:02:32.24
area. They are sitting in their perimeter one night. They are literally just meters from the village.

1084
02:02:33.44 --> 02:02:39.04
That's where this whole story is taking place. As they are sitting there, we will go to the book.

1085
02:02:39.04 --> 02:02:44.24
The first explosion ripped one of the hot support in a blaze of brilliant orange and yellow flame.

1086
02:02:44.24 --> 02:02:49.60
Another deafening explosion than another rip through the air, punctuated by the staccato

1087
02:02:49.60 --> 02:02:55.52
clatter of automatic weapons. We braced trying to print pinpoint the direction of the attack.

1088
02:02:57.52 --> 02:03:04.40
My god, I explained, I exclaimed to no one in particular. They're hitting the village.

1089
02:03:06.08 --> 02:03:13.28
It would be a butchery. The veot Kong had penetrated the eastern end of the village

1090
02:03:13.28 --> 02:03:19.44
and were moving from that hut to thatch hut, throwing satchel charges inside and shooting down anything

1091
02:03:19.44 --> 02:03:27.12
that moved. Sergeant Palamine. Leave back third squad and come with me. We're counter attacking

1092
02:03:27.12 --> 02:03:34.16
into the village in two minutes. They dashed for the village. We dashed for the village as the

1093
02:03:34.16 --> 02:03:41.36
flames burst upward. The scene revealed before us was ghastly. A mother ran by me with her decapitated

1094
02:03:41.36 --> 02:03:47.92
baby, her own left arm hanging by a strip of flesh. Two veot Kong stood behind her trying to shoot

1095
02:03:47.92 --> 02:03:54.24
them down, and cold rage, I fired into their faces. Their heads collapsing into a pulpy mush.

1096
02:03:56.48 --> 02:04:01.52
Two young girls came running at me tears of pain streaming from their eyes at a glance I could

1097
02:04:01.52 --> 02:04:07.36
see that both had been disfigured by shrapnel. The veot Kong had their mission. Kill as many

1098
02:04:07.36 --> 02:04:12.000
villagers as quickly as possible and they were doing it well, but they didn't expect our

1099
02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:19.44
sudden rush upon the midpoint blank range. From somewhere in the smoke and fire a woman emerged

1100
02:04:19.44 --> 02:04:25.36
with her young son. She thrust a little boy at me begging for help and veot and amise. The boy

1101
02:04:25.36 --> 02:04:30.32
was folded completely in half at the stomach a deep wound across the small of his back allowing

1102
02:04:30.32 --> 02:04:38.48
his fat little body to be creased as neatly as a piece of cardboard. Surely he was dead. I looked

1103
02:04:38.48 --> 02:04:44.64
into the mother's eyes and patented her on the head. Later, I said, I'll help you later. We pressed

1104
02:04:44.64 --> 02:04:49.76
the attack back to the edge of the village almost a fourth of it was now burning. One more

1105
02:04:49.76 --> 02:04:56.72
American fell with a chest wound and collapsed as long. We broke the back of the attack. Vc

1106
02:04:56.72 --> 02:05:03.04
bodies laid sprawled on the wire through which they could not withdraw. The dead and dying

1107
02:05:03.04 --> 02:05:10.16
lay everywhere a bit amid the burning huts. From the glare of the roaring flames I could see dead

1108
02:05:10.16 --> 02:05:16.96
and wounded Vietnamese laying in twisted piles. Already the older women had begun their pitiful

1109
02:05:16.96 --> 02:05:23.36
whales of mourning, shrieking and tearing at their hair and faces. Smoke filled the air,

1110
02:05:23.36 --> 02:05:29.68
but it could not cover the accurate smell of death that filled my nostrils. Children search for

1111
02:05:29.68 --> 02:05:35.52
their missing elders or huddled in groups, groping at each other for comfort. Their eyes wide and terror.

1112
02:05:37.04 --> 02:05:42.64
A mother rocked her one-legged baby to her breast, his lifeless eyes undisturbed by the bright

1113
02:05:42.64 --> 02:05:52.48
flame, silireting them both. The worst had happened. The enemy had struck directly against the village

1114
02:05:52.48 --> 02:05:59.52
and had most assuredly killed and wounded many of their own families. It was unbelievable,

1115
02:05:59.52 --> 02:06:06.24
but it had been done. I knew that true-long lamb had been a defeat.

1116
02:06:07.76 --> 02:06:12.96
Like the entire American system in Vietnam we had fought a limited military war with constrained

1117
02:06:12.96 --> 02:06:19.36
objectives. The enemy had fought a total political war with no pre-ordained restrictions.

1118
02:06:19.36 --> 02:06:30.24
We were doomed from the outset. We were the focus of the vehicle on attacks because we kept

1119
02:06:30.24 --> 02:06:38.000
the village alive. If we died so with the village, but even at that we were the indirect objective.

1120
02:06:39.04 --> 02:06:45.20
The village was the direct objective. If the villages were destroyed, then there would be no village.

1121
02:06:45.20 --> 02:06:52.72
But only now did I understand that kind of logic. It had not occurred to me that the enemy

1122
02:06:52.72 --> 02:06:58.88
could take such a step to hit the village would ensure the wounding and killing of their own kin.

1123
02:07:00.32 --> 02:07:05.04
In a battle within the confines of the village itself there could be no discrimination among

1124
02:07:05.04 --> 02:07:08.64
family, communist sympathizers and government loyalists.

1125
02:07:08.64 --> 02:07:16.56
Every day I saw the children of the village, they were like all children, queue and deering,

1126
02:07:16.56 --> 02:07:20.96
growing with the emotional and physical needs of children the world over.

1127
02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:29.76
I couldn't hurt them. It was unthinkable. The possibility was so barbaric that it was alien to my mind.

1128
02:07:31.12 --> 02:07:33.52
But my mind was not the mind of the enemy.

1129
02:07:33.52 --> 02:07:39.92
Though I had tried to understand them even to think like them, if only to defeat them,

1130
02:07:41.52 --> 02:07:49.68
I had fallen short. For a few more days, we continued to patrol the area.

1131
02:07:50.96 --> 02:07:56.64
It was a bureaucratic gesture, a mere continuance of what we had been doing for so long.

1132
02:07:56.64 --> 02:08:04.96
I kept to myself my own recognition of the emptiness of our work. It was essential for the

1133
02:08:04.96 --> 02:08:07.36
men to be convinced of the importance of their mission.

1134
02:08:09.68 --> 02:08:17.52
Chuang Lam was no more, but leadership must always be positive.

1135
02:08:17.52 --> 02:08:30.88
So he wasn't really expecting that that the VC would come in and just slaughter everyone in

1136
02:08:30.88 --> 02:08:37.28
the village or as many people as they could. Unbelievable savagery.

1137
02:08:37.28 --> 02:08:50.08
Now as we wrap this up, he gets his relief. Just like he had come in the beginning of the book

1138
02:08:50.08 --> 02:08:54.88
and he takes over for somebody. Somebody comes to take his place and he leaves.

1139
02:08:54.88 --> 02:09:06.16
And he tries to keep track of what happened to them or how they fought and things that occurred.

1140
02:09:07.52 --> 02:09:11.76
And we'll go to the book here as scheduled, the platoon moved on and continued to fight.

1141
02:09:11.76 --> 02:09:17.68
As long as I could, I kept the watch on the fate of the men. Specialist Nail was wounded yet again.

1142
02:09:18.96 --> 02:09:23.68
Platoon Sergeant Palaman got out in front of the platoon and a firefight and took an enemy

1143
02:09:23.68 --> 02:09:30.56
rocket-propelled grenade in the right leg. I learned that Corporal Killigan survived his wounds,

1144
02:09:30.56 --> 02:09:36.72
although he lost a long and a stretch of intestines. Sergeant Don made it home on touch to

1145
02:09:36.72 --> 02:09:43.28
one of the few. Sergeant James and Specialist King were killed, although the circumstances surrounding

1146
02:09:43.28 --> 02:09:53.92
their deaths were never made clear to me. And so it went. An infantry men's days were numbered and the

1147
02:09:53.92 --> 02:10:05.76
law of attrition applied to the platoon as it always did. In the summer of 1971, I flew out of

1148
02:10:05.76 --> 02:10:14.96
Camerand Bay to return to my wife and infant son. I had just made captain. It had been a long 12 months

1149
02:10:15.92 --> 02:10:26.48
and I had changed in more ways than rank. A National Airport in Washington, D.C., a pretty young woman

1150
02:10:26.48 --> 02:10:34.32
stood waiting in the terminal as I walked up the ramp. By her knee stood a 15-month-old child with

1151
02:10:34.32 --> 02:10:41.52
curly blonde hair barely able to keep his balance on his chubby little legs. I kissed them both

1152
02:10:41.52 --> 02:10:58.000
hello. The woman was happy. The boy was confused. I was both. I was also sad. I mourned for the men

1153
02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:06.32
I had left behind. I grieved that their country would never know what fine men they were.

1154
02:11:09.04 --> 02:11:20.88
I was proud to have served with them. And no doubt, I absolutely feel the same way.

1155
02:11:20.88 --> 02:11:34.24
The amazing men and women who I saw cut down at the height of their lives.

1156
02:11:34.24 --> 02:11:47.60
Our country will never really know what fine people they were, what fine human beings they were.

1157
02:11:52.16 --> 02:11:59.52
I hope that from that, from their sacrifice we can take and we can learn from what they

1158
02:11:59.52 --> 02:12:07.60
learned. And we can be inspired by them and driven by them and become better leaders and better

1159
02:12:07.60 --> 02:12:18.80
people from their example. And from the example of men like Jim McDonough and Hackworth and Bob Hoffman

1160
02:12:18.80 --> 02:12:34.80
can't all those other those warriors and leaders that have taken point and led the way.

1161
02:12:34.80 --> 02:12:54.24
And we try to follow them down that path. As we remember those who gave their lives

1162
02:12:54.24 --> 02:13:08.56
to clear that path for us, just so much to be taken away from this experience.

1163
02:13:10.56 --> 02:13:15.60
And it's almost like let's just read the whole book.

1164
02:13:15.60 --> 02:13:24.64
But there's so much more that I didn't cover that I wanted to. And you know the fact of the

1165
02:13:24.64 --> 02:13:30.32
matter is you can get this book on Amazon. You buy the book, you learn. That's what you do.

1166
02:13:31.04 --> 02:13:35.36
You don't have to live through this stuff to be able to take away some of the lessons from it.

1167
02:13:37.04 --> 02:13:44.08
And because that was such a such a good book and there's so much information in it. Obviously

1168
02:13:44.08 --> 02:13:52.16
I went long. So we're gonna hold off until next time to do a little Q&A.

1169
02:13:55.76 --> 02:14:04.48
But if you do want to support the podcast, there's a couple of ways you can do that.

1170
02:14:04.48 --> 02:14:16.16
Number one, you can go to the website. Jocquistore.com. You can click on the Amazon link and you can

1171
02:14:16.16 --> 02:14:22.56
buy this book right here. The book is called the two-meter a memoir of command and combat by James

1172
02:14:22.56 --> 02:14:28.000
Armick Duna. And you should do that. You should do yourself that favor.

1173
02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:36.32
Yeah, and also another way it could be simpler is just go to the website, jocquist.com and go

1174
02:14:36.32 --> 02:14:40.72
into the books section or list all the books that you cover. That'll be on there. You just click on the

1175
02:14:40.72 --> 02:14:46.48
book, boom it'll take you right to the to the Amazon link even easier. Yeah that way you don't have

1176
02:14:46.48 --> 02:14:52.32
to search if you're, you know, if you're in a time crunch. I like that. What else, what else can we do

1177
02:14:52.32 --> 02:14:58.72
to support the podcast? Just if you're going to buy anything from Amazon go to the jocquistore.com

1178
02:14:58.72 --> 02:15:03.60
or jocquist.com click on the Amazon link before you do your shopping. It'll take you to Amazon just

1179
02:15:03.60 --> 02:15:09.36
like you would have gone anyway. And then you know, do your shopping. There you go you can support that

1180
02:15:09.36 --> 02:15:16.000
way passively. And then also on jocquistore if you like, you know, the shirts we got,

1181
02:15:17.60 --> 02:15:21.92
some coffee mugs on there, some stickers or whatever. You know, if you like any of that stuff,

1182
02:15:21.92 --> 02:15:30.32
just get some, get some. And of course, if you're into supplements or you're running low on

1183
02:15:30.32 --> 02:15:39.76
supplements, go to or go back to on it.com slash jocco and and get some those are the good ones.

1184
02:15:40.40 --> 02:15:47.36
Pick up some acrylic oil for yourself. Yeah. Pick up some strong bone. Pick up where your bars.

1185
02:15:47.36 --> 02:15:51.92
Some warrior bars. Somebody got a little low. I've got a little shipment of warrior bars in today. And I

1186
02:15:51.92 --> 02:15:58.40
must say thank you. Yeah. It's just a game. It's just it saves the day. Yeah. It saves the day. Let's

1187
02:15:58.40 --> 02:16:06.56
snack snacks. Someone asked, uh, are warrior bars postwork out or are they a meal replacement? Like what

1188
02:16:06.56 --> 02:16:13.04
are they all the above? It's all of that. And it's just a snack. It's a snack. But then you eat

1189
02:16:13.04 --> 02:16:18.88
two that's a little meal. You eat three that's like a full meal more or less. Maybe with a salad or something.

1190
02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:31.20
But it's yeah, it's it's good. As always, if you want to kind of kick it with echo and I,

1191
02:16:31.20 --> 02:16:40.88
you can do that right on the olden webs. And I am at jocco-willing echo Charles is at echo Charles.

1192
02:16:40.88 --> 02:16:47.36
That's on the Twitter. That's on the Facebook. Uh, that's also on the Instagram. Oh,

1193
02:16:47.36 --> 02:16:52.000
quick thing about the Instagram. I just found this out not yesterday, but like the day before

1194
02:16:52.80 --> 02:16:59.12
that there's like direct messages on Instagram. You probably didn't even know that. Yeah. I

1195
02:16:59.12 --> 02:17:03.84
I did not know that because they have it on Twitter and people send me direct messages. Okay. So

1196
02:17:03.84 --> 02:17:08.80
you can show me how to check that. Well, yeah. Okay. So you're using people send me some messages.

1197
02:17:08.80 --> 02:17:14.24
Yeah. A lot of people send me some and it's been I've had Instagram for a long time. Yeah. So there's a lot

1198
02:17:14.24 --> 02:17:20.32
of them. I'm like, oh, man, I got a respond, but basically if if I don't respond, it's not because I'm

1199
02:17:20.32 --> 02:17:26.48
ignoring it. It's because straight up I didn't know it was going off. You're supposed to be the

1200
02:17:26.48 --> 02:17:32.80
the tech guy here. Oh, man. I know. Hey, I'm learning. Hey, look, I learned, right? Yes, you did. Good.

1201
02:17:32.80 --> 02:17:42.32
Did learn with that. You can join us there and you can join us as we continue to try and get a

1202
02:17:42.32 --> 02:17:50.56
little bit better. Trying to do a little bit better. And we got examples of leadership like McDonald

1203
02:17:50.56 --> 02:17:57.12
uh, like the people that we talk about. The people that I admire and the people that I look to and

1204
02:17:57.12 --> 02:18:08.96
say, yes, that person stepped up and led. That's the example that I try and follow. People that

1205
02:18:08.96 --> 02:18:14.88
stepped up and led through hard situations who dealt with the dichotomy of leadership and yet

1206
02:18:15.92 --> 02:18:21.04
dealt with the almost unwinnable situations dealt with the rules of engagement dealt with

1207
02:18:21.04 --> 02:18:29.28
challenges dealt with their own platoonly members threatening them to kill them dealt with all

1208
02:18:29.28 --> 02:18:45.76
of those things and yet they still led. And so us we got it easy. We got it easy. So there's no excuse

1209
02:18:45.76 --> 02:18:59.60
none to stop any of us from getting up and getting after it. So until next time

1210
02:18:59.60 --> 02:19:15.44
this is Echo and Jockel out.
