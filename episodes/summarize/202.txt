are muted this far out we can hear artillery explosions but not small arms fire we're all peering over the sides looking abysio looking at the fires and the smoke and the explosions it's an awesome sight a massive smoke and flames holy Moses look at that we say not for the last time we ask ourselves how many of the defenders how the defenders could survive in a place so torn up it's an irrelevant question really many Japanese have survived and they're killing them but have them survived we know that a lot of our men were killed going in and we know that the men who did make it a sure are fighting for their lives we expect we'll have a tough go of it to wear apprehensive who wouldn't be and we're wondering how we'll behave in combat I know the new guys are especially concerned with how they'll behave the great fear the greatest of fear is you won't be able to handle it that you'll turn yellow that you'll let your buddies down we fear this much more than we fear getting killed or wounded one reason for that is no one really thinks he'll be killed or wounded you never think it's going to happen to you never you acknowledge that it could happen to you that it might happen to you but the rational part of your brain makes you understand this but in the such circumstances we now find ourselves emotion trumps rationality every time we know we're too young to die and somehow in a kind of strange and protective twist of logic and feeling we figure that because we're too young to die we certainly won't die you've got to do a lot of hard thinking to reach this conclusion however and because we're all thinking so hard we're not talking that much just as well the engine is so loud you can't talk or hear anyone except the guy standing next to you we wait for the word to begin the assault but it doesn't come we continue circling beneath the hot sun beneath breathing exhaust fumes staring at the island we want we want to know what for Pete's sake is happening we wonder what they're when they're going to send us in and where they're going to send us we wonder gosh how much longer can it go all like this a lot longer it turns out nightfall one moment in the sun one moment the sun is above the horizon and their sky is bright then the sun drops below the horizon in the dark that's how night comes in the tropics no twilight this is on the on-hequator and what what why was that why was that a bad thing we knew that that probably some way we knew that that was where they haven't heard this time was on that beach still shouting major haze assures us that red too won't be a problem the Japanese positions on the beach have been eliminated he tells us and our landing will be unopposed you'll probably go in standing up he actually said that so you said in the book he actually said I guess we were completely surprised thinking back we were none of us really believed we'd go in standing up now not that we think meet major haze is feeding us a line he's a good man he wouldn't do that but it could be that he has been misinformed uninformed is more likely more like it totally uninformed communications with the units ashore or deseray and several instances functionally not existed the same goes for communications with general smith and his staff on the battle ship Maryland the invasions fleet flagship this is doing large but charged measure to failure of our radios which are too fragile to withstand the rigors of amphibious assault I've got a walking talking strapped over my shoulder and it's a hunk of joke hunk of junk I can't even communicate with the other boats which is why major haze had to come by in but that's true what was that what was the fucking dog is what we're doing any good now the officer in charge a red two at that time was Colonel Schupe the 10 of Colonel Schupe he became the combatant later on years later in any event we're relieved the waiting is almost over the business of riding around in boats is for the birds we want to get ashore and throw some punches I'm standing in the battle of our LCVP behind me are 32 marines of my pertune most of them teenagers most of them new to combat I look at them and they look at me I see fresh boyace facias and wide-wired eyes staring out from beneath their brain their helmet brims their helmets all seem a size too big accentuating their boyish making them look young as well most of them really are their helmets jammed down on their heads the straps pulled tight under their chin you can wear helmets this way so they don't fall off while you're clamoring down the cargo nets of the troop transport into your boat the helmet is nothing more than a steel pot heavy and getting heavier the longer you wear it if it falls off all you're on that net it could hit somebody beneath you somebody could get hurt and that's when and that's not when marines are supposed to get hurt not during the boating phase as it's called the phase of the operation when the emphasis is on safety the getting hurt part the part where safety is one might say beside the point comes later for us for me in the men in my boat that part comes now did I say men yeah major haze was right he said we'd be going in standing up and that's what we're doing not that we want to there's no other way no place to run no place to hide some men crowds in the water they watch the bullet patterns the curtains trying to figure out when the curtain will sweep over them it's all a matter of timing they'll duck under water at the right moment to avoid getting shot it would be a good plan if only there were two if only there were one or two machine guns firing at them but there are many many machine guns firing creating multiple curtains that meet and intermingle an overlap and crisscross yeah bullets are flying every which way worse the guns are aimed to fire just inches above the surface so if you crouch with your head just above the water you're likely to get your head drilled might as well stand up that way you'll get shot the chest or stomach which is usually fatal instead of to the head which is almost always fatal also if you're crouching in the water you're not moving and if you're not moving your stationary target and your easier to shoot you have to keep moving you have to get to shore get a shore or die and the whole thing orders were don't stop to help anybody everybody's going to get killed just you get sure stuff in my man that's stop to help me violate those orders that told him don't wait for me go on no no there are planes here now our planes are coming in and strapping and we wonder what is going on of this when they were they were strapping that ship I returned to the task at hand keep moving to the shore how long has this been going on how long have been out here in the water I can't say I have no sense of time everything is moving in slow motion second seems to last minutes minute seemed to last hours it just keeps going on and on every moment is intense filled with intense thoughts emotions actions I'm thinking how can I protect myself how can I protect my men someone screams another one of my men is hit and another and another help corpsman some are killed outright some are wounded some are well it's hard to say some go quietly some noisely they fall back in the water they slip onto the water some flail in the water and they're paying in panic howling and shouting I keep moving my adrenaline is flowing like an electric current through me allowing me to do things I wouldn't normally and shouldn't normally do if I stop to think about what I'm doing I'd freeze up I try to track the bullets the movement in patterns of the enemy's traversing fire the bullets impact start to my left to my right the bullets sweeping back and forth I see no pattern or rather I see too many patterns splat splat splat everywhere it's like the enemy throwing thousands and thousands of stones at us a pattern of splats in the water comes towards me from the right sweeps pass me continue to the left I don't hear the crack of the bullets as they zip by its supersonic speed that's the problem they're not zipping past us they're hitting us they've got our range yeah quite a contrast to the tropical heat and brilliant sunlight on Bezier when Anthony had medicine and yeah shot in the head while peering over the sea wall and red beach too Anthony had fallen back into John Murdoch's arms still alive but unconscious his body twitching his eyes open but empty John held him for a brief time spoke to him and then set him aside on the beach among the bodies of other slain Marines where he died a few minutes later all the solemn knees appropriate to the occasion where observed all the rights were performed the colors were trouped speeches were giving music was played prayers were offered we saying the national anthem the Marine him and amazing grace there was a presentation of military testimonials proclamations were made John Murdoch gave a talk about Anthony then presented Anthony's brother with the purple heart a fitting gesture from a man who comforted Anthony in his final moments of his life and honor guard fired at 21 gun salute taps was played we all wept our tears were shed in both sorrow and joy there was cause for both Anthony's life had been short his dying heart his glory everlasting there was no bitterness no disillusionment no anger his life had mattered his death also and we remembered both and knew that both had meaning and purpose the biographical sketch in the program for the ceremony expressed the feelings well in this regard and serves as a fitting epitaph for every marine in the second world war and here's what it read if the world had been different if he had been born at another time Anthony with his sunshine smile could have married raised a family had grandchildren and lived a quiet typically traditional American life but the early 1940s were not normal times a fascist dictator threatened to conquer Europe and forge an alliance with the militarists who controlled the Japanese government and they're distorted plan for world domination and unprepared and unsuspecting United States became a primary target the American people were shocked in the action by the Sunday morning arrival of Japanese bombers over a wahoo like hundreds of thousands of other young Americans Anthony felt compelled to volunteer to serve his country he simply could not stand aside while America was under attack Anthony gave his life on tarua for his country his core and for his fellow Marines he was not a famous hero more than a by millions extolled in the press immortalized in magazine articles or books he was no one special just another marine private first class the American people should thank god eternally for Anthony and his fellow Marines soldiers see men and airmen who preserved and won a magnificent victory over a wickedly evil enemy semper five brother you are not forgotten and with that Dean Lad has left the building and actually who has joined us in the building looks like Jason Gargert, Jason Gargert's randomly we are in spokane Washington spokane spokane spokane yeah is is crazy to read i'm gonna read it the battle between the american and japanese surface fleets began a little before zero to two hundred like a suddenly breaking storm of cataclysmic size and power in the language of naval tacticians the coming together of two fleets in sea-large channel constituted what is known as a meeting engage in engagement but collision engagement is a better term for describing what happened steaming more or less blindly into the channel of fleets ran into each other at oblique angles their ships quickly became intermingled resulting in a close quarters melee that saw the combatants charging madly about their big guns flashing and booming hurling red hot shells and high flaming arcs above the channel the thunder of the guns rolled across the black water a steady pulsating roar and the molten projectile streak leg meteors crisscrossing the skies with fiery tails rising and falling and crashing into ships and exploding in massive fireballs violent secondary explosions caused by ammunition cooking off in the intense heat of the detonating shells rock some of the ships and sent them furiously ablaze blurning like roman candles fountains of fire sparking and shooting flames and blasting big chunks of steel in every direction all the while star shells and flares burst high above the channel and invaded like dying galaxies as they drifted down at the end of their parachutes into the extinguishing water the canisters that held the flares periodically flew over our positions charging like locomotives search lights probe the dirt lower darkness with their long brilliant beams sweeping back and forth above the surface by secting fixing on some hapless ship bringing the blazing shells down on it streams of tracers from automatic cannons and machine guns curved through the middle of the air every now and then an airant torpedo slammed into the beach below us 2500 pounds of explosives blasting a big crater at the waterline we watched all this from our foxes on the ridge front row seats to a spectacle that john murder john mordocla likened to all the fourth of July's I ever saw my life all put together at once we were a vocal audience awestruck and profane a ship would explode and all up and down the line you'd hear men exclaiming cheese a surprise and holy shit you we also conducted aggressive patrols and probe their lines at giving as good as we got or maybe even better if more frontline Japanese soldiers had survived the war maybe be reading memoirs by those veterans of Guadalcanal campaign recounting how the US Marines terrorized them at night and terrorized them we most certainly did some guys really enjoyed this part of the job teenagers who found their true nature in the jungle who discovered that they were born for the warrior life there were very there were a few in every unit more than a few actually more than you might expect more than I expected they went after the Japanese with a competence and enthusiasm that made them almost as frightening to their officers as they must have been to their enemies it was just amazing observed Murdoch how you could take kids like these and put them out into the jungle and in just a few weeks they'd be great at jungle warfare for them it was like playing cowboys and Indians they'd come back from a patrol and you'd hear them talk how many teeth did you get or how many did you kill and they'd brag while I killed three or four now I wanted these patrols much earlier than what we're talking about right now I was leading this patrol and had four five others with me and we ended up we were in a location where the army had now passed through our lines and they were in control so we came right by the reddish metal regimental CP and the army colonel says what do you guys doing here said well we got it with constant patrols as well we're in charge here now we don't need you any more and so we said so the we moved on for a little bit further back to our own line where we were in reserve and it turned out we had a little bit higher than we was so he'd look up at us and we were on the skyline from his from his perspective very skyline in reality in combat there are few instances when men used bayonets in the traditional manner fixed to the rifles bayonet drills were performed for their psychological effect so that men would learn the psychology of the bayonet namely to kill brutally quickly and unthinkingly without compunction or moral qualms so done realistic as far as the application right but our training merely paved the way for our transformation into hardened killers exposure to actual combat accomplished and completed the process you got hard or you died it was that simple killer be a killer be killed you know and the Japanese made it simple they were they were notoriously unspearing their reputation for ruthlessness and savagery was widespread and well-founded we knew all the stories the rape of Nand King the Badan death marks atrocities committed far and wide and often against prisoners we believed correctly that we could expect no pity if we fell into their hands they neither asked for quarter nor gave any and we responded in kind if they had set rules as we believed we were damn sure going to play by them one other choice do we have they simply would not surrender they would not stop coming out us until we killed them very quickly we learned that trying to take prisoners was a waste of time and dangerous even the wounded if we went to treat them would try and kill us by usually by blowing up everyone themselves and the corpsmen who had stopped to help them with a grenade the dead had a nasty habit of rising up from the ground and attacking us so we made sure the dead were truly dead no sense in taking chances this killer be killed approach to war was as brutalizing as it was brutal and affected everyone to some degree Murdock recalled a corpsman who came up to me and said hey lieutenant I've got well I've got a live one can I shoot him yeah it does not look good you also had some people that couldn't that didn't adopt that mentality and here's Murdoch talking about it talking about people that couldn't adopt that killer be killed mentality he said they'd have to go back because they were no good to us they just disappear they'd be sent back to the states it was a self-weeding process the guys who remained were the guys you could depend on when I became company commander New Zealand that was an awful thing I had to do we could send 3% of our personnel home every so often so they could start new outfits back in the states but you never wanted to send the good guys home you send the shitheads and the screwups I wanted the best men with me I didn't want any of my good men to go in New Zealand just before we sailed for Talawa Tarawa Murdoch told our company now listen I'm gonna send some of you guys home if you fuck up you're going to go but he told me later these kids were so good they just wouldn't do that they wouldn't fuck up on purpose they would do their job and do it well they didn't want to be come known as a fuck up and a lot of those kids were killed on Talawa that I could have sent home yeah check out those books and Mikey in the dragons I don't know a lot of people as I as I always say a lot of people think that's the best kids book ever written pretty well at least for sure at least I do discipline goes freedom field manual you can get that book if you want to get after it and what's interesting about that book is there's no book like it and my publisher I was like is this the biggest risk you've ever took with published in a book and he's like oh absolutely not even close there's no book like it yeah we're in there saving in completely at their mercy you say here 600 yards six football fields just under a third of a mile if you run that distance on dry land unencumbered and unimposed you'll be gasping at the finish line i don't care what kind of shape you're in we're in water and we're wearing and carrying 60 pounds or more of gear and the Japanese are ripping us apart they've got an absolutely clear field of fire and we have to walk straight into it when i returned and i looked i went clear out there where i was hit and walked in and i saw remains of old carbines and so on down in the sand we've got a walk not run because we're in the water remember walk slowly because we can't run we can't even walk fast the marines are the world's experts in amphibious warfare the core has been training for the past two decades to assault an established beach head on a hostile shore it has developed complex doctrines to guide us in such endeavors at bayjio on 21 November 1943 all that training in doctrine doctrine has come to this we step out of our LCVPs into shallow water and walk slowly across 600 yards with absolutely no cover whatsoever to make a frontal assault on heavily fortified and defended enemy positions on my website just go to it by my name just Dean Lad there is a poem in here called curtains of fire and it goes in a great detail similar kind of words but done done a little differently well I'll be a dirty name then he discarded his rifle and started throwing grenades at the top of the ridge the reality of our sudden harrowing plight then struck me this was my first major combat test as a platoon leader and I realized that I had to take immediate and firm control of myself I could not show fear in front of my men a couple feet to my right private McCoy Reynolds had been hurling grenades one after the other each time courageously standing up and exposing himself to enemy fire he crouched down next to me and scanned the top of the ridge then he exclaimed I see them and threw another grenade in the next instant he was shot through the neck killed instantly he fell at my feet for a moment I just looked at him his eyes wide open lifeless stared back at me then I realized that now more than ever I had to get a grip on things and seize control of what was becoming an increasingly chaotic situation I decided at once we needed support from our mortars and backed a little way down the ridge out of the field of fire to further assess the situation now at the same time we were running low on an ammunition as well and we sent back call we need more ammunition next thing we know bandaliar after bandaliar of ammunition started arriving just the same as same Guided guys now that's an interesting I mean you recognized that that you needed to get control of your emotions is that something you would thought about what made you realize that what made you realize and he wanted me to succeed in part because my success would reflect well on him but mainly because he was generally genuinely proud of me also because i was a known quantity whom he had personally mentored he much preferred me to be giving orders rather than some 90 day wonder fresh out of training in the states since he had taught me everything i knew he was confident that in combat together we would more or less be thinking along the same lines and important connection for a top sergeant to have with his petoon leader nor did he know what he broke the slightest in subordination toward me from anyone else in the petoon you obey your lieutenant or you'll have to answer to me he growled at my guys and you could be damn sure they did nobody wanted to have to answer to right sounds like an outstanding marine i'm pretty soon you're going again me getting into a part is my my first encounter of very close calls was losing my life on hill 78 second platoon was dealing with a lone sniper who had fired on us from the open trees on the coastal flap of below he was high up in one of those trees high enough to place my little above the hilltop allowing him to shoot down to us at a shallow angle he pottered us pottered us for a better part of four hours and then by the buy and buy and much to my astonishment a lieutenant i didn't recognize came strolling along in the ridge fully upright fully exposed this sniper smirking at us i was lying on the belly on my belly in the grass and he approached me saying i would be worried about that sniper can't hit me one in the next instant a shot rang out and a bullet wing disarm can't get complacent uh you continue on but they were always present in your head and on your mind you could never fully let go or get rid of them the unrelenting mental strain not to do not not to mention the physical dangers that caused it made us twitch your each passing day you know during the during the times that we were we were back behind the front lines and nobody's shooting at you home like I said it's wonderful nobody's shooting at me and all that stress you know now you now you don't have to worry about it now what about the fact that even though no one's shooting at you right now you have time to sit there and think about the fact that you're going to go again and the enemy's going to attack you and you know somebody pull up pull it what it was stupid thing so it pierced your intestines bladder and sacrum just before that and an exited missing my spinal nerve by a quarter of an inch as it is I'll probably die in a few minutes I'm scared I think my gosh this is it if it happens that you get shot and you don't know how bad the wound it often happens that you get shot you don't know how bad the wound is but when you're hit where I was hit you know it's bad it's a gut wound and you know it's pretty sure thing you're not going to make it very few people survive gut wounds even in the best of circumstances I'm in what are arguably the worst of circumstances if I had been shot on try land I might be able to crawl to an aid station or my buddies might have passed me up but I'm in a lagoon so there can be no crawling and my buddies are forbidden to help me it goes without saying that there are no aid stations close by I can try to reach our LCVPs on the reef a hundred yards behind me and he didn't enough at enough action going on where he was steady was coming down the line where there's air reaction he wanted to get into it well he came he came right by where I was and no one in two months when great was right shortly after that one of our one of our rounds dropped in short he lost two legs in an arm and he was in there's an article in the said reading post about it and saying that at least I have the right arm to wrap the bar with for a drink I'll tell about it and there's some too words uh you guys that during this you also talk about the fact that you would be young stuff back and forth to the Japanese they're a little bit a little bit they'd be yelling at you guys and you'd yell back at them and it sounds like during the daytime yeah ski then announced he was quitting the marine core and quitting the war he meant what he said he was about to head back to the rear when Murdoch arrived on the scene Murdoch's calm ski down and told him that he just couldn't up and quit that it would be desertion in the face of the enemy and that he would get a lot of trouble for it Murdoch spoke softly with him for several minutes in this vein until ski came to a senses ski picked up as weapon and rejoined third platoon and Murdoch assumed command of that unit but ski was a changed man exchanging one man as for another he went from being a marine who did his job and did it well to being a marine who did his job with a singular passion from that day forward he hated the Japanese with a savage intensity and took it on himself to personally avenge Lund's death often going off by himself to hunt the enemy if you were a compassionate man you might say a prayer for any Japanese soldiers who crossed his path he always returned eventually but with little to say about his exploits he was the quiet type guys like him usually are shells exploding washing gaizers machine guns rattling splat splat splat those little dots in the water thousands of them moving this way and that a bullet hits four feet to my right splat splat then bullets hit three feet two foot one foot to my right sure do hope they skip over me and they do this time splat they begin hitting to my left one foot two foot three foot and so on I got lucky I literally dodged the bullet several bullets how long will my luck hold I can't see any muzzle flashes from the enemy guns the Japanese are invisible just like their bullets we're being slaughtered by an invisible force nothing to see nothing to shoot at not that we would be shooting if we could see them you don't stand an open water shooting at the enemy you get yourself to the beach you take cover i mean one second we're looking at this slab of a metal ramp then the ramp drops and we're looking at it in furno fire and smoke fill our bit frame of vision frame by the sides of the bottom and the bottom of the boat orange fire red fire and black black smoke the fire is shooting up the smoke is rolling curling climbing is fast and high the sky isn't high enough to contain it you think we were looking at a volcano being born you wonder what could produce so much smoke surely by now everything on basio that can burn has burned so where's all that smoke coming from from the bowels of the earth it would seem from somewhere deep underground under the ocean from the ever ever blazing furnaces of the world unless not forget the explosions there are a lot of them explosions here they're everywhere fire and fire balls tongues of flame crimson and yellow flashes in the smoke the time is 0-615 and some 600 marines are about to be launched or rather launch themselves at basio codenamed Helen i'm at the front of the boat the lieutenant the platoon leader time for me to lead a few seconds go by i was a few seconds ago i was deploying the limited protection offered by the thin metal ramp now i'm deploying the lack of that limited protection it was after all better than nothing which is what i've got now i kind of feel sick and i'm thinking god why am i in this mess what am i doing here oh god they're in our whole help help they're blood curling cries and thrashing sounds were plainly audible to everyone in the vicinity there were on a point little bit a little bit a head of our regular line and this has gotta be just this is on a mental weedless and horrified but stayed in our holes that's how bad it was to get out of your holes you don't dare because you you anybody outside the holes enemy suddenly the yelling sounds of the fighting ceased we actually waited and listened to pairing through the rain and into the darkness then the Japanese begin probing our position all up and down the line running up to the crest and chucking a few grenades over the top at our holes and running back down hill after the grenades exploded usually harmlessly our guys would leap from their holes dashed to the crest and throw grenades at the fleeting enemy then they'd scamper back to their holes and the Japanese would return to herle their grenades back and forth and went through the night intervals of silence and then flash bang of grenades exploding and men hollering and cursing in the English and Japanese the next morning we discovered that one of them men in the machine gun post had been killed that's that day and headed to death the others have been wounded but somehow they'd beaten back their attackers and you were saying this earlier and I led Denver reconnaissance patrol myself taking out four or five men with me and finding out where they were that was scary situation to all these reconnaissance patrols you know right before they before they stopped that as you're still pushing forward up that ridge you got some great detail in here that's absolutely worth talking about going to the book here the ammunition was quickly distributed so you called for ammunition the ammunition was quickly distributed and once again we moved up hill shooting as we went another of my man men private Walter Cuss was favorally hit while scouting up the ridge from a different direction at the moment of his death he exailed the his last breath and that out a long rising how of pain and anguish like a dying animal it had been run before we landed there sometime before about time before our work and run up like on on the reef and just was still there while the Japanese swam up to it with the machine guns they fired flying in fire right on us so all this is happening and you run the reserves and finally you guys are told all right load your boats which means you guys now know you're going in and you say here we don't know whether the brass is setting us so I opened my eyes and smiled at him and he goes you son of a bitch he goes right from speaking lap Latin to calling me a son of a bitch then he took me down to the infirmary and they patched me up a bit then he took me to his state room and put me in his bed I must have slept all day and all night I didn't hear a thing I wasn't feeling any pain my night my right hand and arm will numb when I came to I didn't know where I was at first then I took a shower changed the bandages and got cleaned up that was the end of my war there my second day on side pan my right arm was no good really my hand even today is no good but nobody knew him at reunions didn't know him so you look out there's six hundred and he and he and I were being lifted up by the by the transport and a bat sabisid and a basket and remote and says it just as we were okay just about up from the landing boat and in this basket taken a reason up to the transport itself and i made a comment says looks like looks like we made it his comment was you made it you made it and he died so you look down going back to this point when the ramp actually opens and you see you've got 600 yards to go and just nothing but machine gun fire and as you said earlier the Japanese you'd watch them storm forward without any ability to maneuver just only thing to do with the salt and now here you are we are no maneuver in the exact same situation gosh they're shooting at us we find this interesting bullets zipping by splatting on the water surface splash splat here splat there splats to the left and right splats in front of us look by golly there's some enemy fire hitting right over there look over there that's me talking that's all of us talking talking and pointing at the impact circles in the water little splats little dots where bullets hit people shooting at us fascinating realizing that we could get our head shot off we ducked down and ducked down into the boat the more bullets splatting into the water but none hit our LCVP we tell ourselves that those are that most are 7.7 millimeter slugs which is what your basic light Japanese machine gun fires and are nothing really much to worry about because they're too small to pierce even the thin skined higgins boat that's what we tell ourselves well I suppose they are we call them men we treat them as men we expect them to act like men they are after all united states marines but really their kids just out of high school or not even that kids with rifles true kids trained to kill also true but kids never the last just turn 17 many of them to use a term like that as long since fallen into general disuse their youths a state of being between childhood and adulthood today's american mail at exercising a lifestyle choice can often can and often does loiter for many years in that state but in the mid-1940s in a world at war the state of youth tends to pass swiftly and do any disayet violently the youth the kids on my boat have got a lot of growing up to do unfortunately they'll be doing a hefty portion of that growing up in the coming minutes and hours in that period far too many will undergrow all the growing up they will ever experience these are the men that went in yeah thus a raid we picked our way slowly through the battle zone our weapons at the ready all around the dead were thick on the ground in numbers that defied comprehension bodies and pieces of bodies everywhere artillery and pounded the area and chopped up the bodies turning the battlefield into an immense open air abitwar strewn with torsos and limbs and heads and chunks of unadunifiable flesh burned black by fire I could recreate the flow I could recreate the flow and ferocity the battle the patterns of the fight and flight by the numbers and positioning of the dead there would be places pockets of resistance where bodies were pile on top of bodies dead Japanese entangled with that americans frozen in attitudes of hand to hand combat clutching each other plunging bay nets into each other locked in their death struggles arm machine gun positions were tabloids of butchery with bodies of the Japanese heaped in front of positions and bodies of american soldiers slumped over their guns for men who didn't want to be there the US army soldiers they were a lot of drafts and all of a bunch of drafts here too that's crazy after all these years you know we talked a little bit about about Murdoch and and he's quite the character and you talk about him a little bit here because captain what happened to Captain of the block you get somehow somehow Murdoch ends up taking over eventually the block was relieved and replaced by Murdoch who's an ideal a Boston Irishman Murdoch was very funny and very tough a superb combat a superb combat commander and a bit wild too all traits that is younger charges greatly appreciated one manifestation of his toughness apart from his courage and coolness under fire was his disdain for metals and combinations very few men who had him as their CEO including me received decorations Murdoch explained I didn't recommend many people I didn't care if a machine gunner killed 50 men that's what he was supposed to do that's what he's getting paid for that was my attitude once in Hawaii we had a big for the formation with the division and they decorated all these guys one company would give 40 metals out I'd give one my attitude was hey killing japs is our job we're not doing it for metals right this is the thing that's crazy for me to think about here is you know you just have one line it says the war wasn't over right and this is 1944 the war wasn't over and as you talked about earlier the thought was that you know America was gonna have to invade every island until you got right into Tokyo and since you had seen the the how how steadfast the Japanese were you all just thought and I know I mean I've since you know with the old breed is kind of the the the the way that I learned like what those guys went through sledge Eugene sledge but this book is just right out right there with it man it's right there with it and well that the Japanese are also shooting at at us with heavier automatic weapon weapons big 13 millimeter machine guns and the even bigger dual purpose anti boat anti aircraft guns which range in size from 37 millimeter to 77 millimeter and they're lobbying shells from 70 millimeter mountain howwitsers these weapons can and do inflict considerable damage on our salt teams killing and wounded hunting hundreds of them disabling or destroying many amtrax and LCVPs they're not my conceife concern however and never mind that they might at any second blow us to eternity what really bugs me is being hunkered down in this boat where I can't see anything I can't see where we are where we're going where we should be I can't observe the enemy fire engage resistance we're likely to encounter I feel as if I'm going into battle blindfolded this really stinks how can I do my job if I can't see anything how can I be sure the coxin is taking us to the right place my men what are they thinking they're watching me watching to see how I'm bearing up wow what a relief what a relief so going back to the book here and again I'm jumping through some incredible stories but Tinian was declared secure on one August first Patan pulled back about a mile from the coast and set up camp the end of the fighting was very abrupt suddenly we didn't have anything to do there was no enemy activity in the immediate area no danger no shooting I just sat back and tried to enjoy the situation that this wasn't as easy as you might think I was exhausted and filled with a lingering dread a sense that I'd used up all my lives I had I had been become conditioned to wondering whether I was going to survive another day and then all of a sudden all the causes for concern had vanished as though I had been given a reprieve from a death sentence I could hardly believe it a strange feeling I didn't have long to dwell on it a few days later I received orders to return to the states 32 months after leaving San Diego I was going home three weeks later at Pearl Harbor where I'd been marking time in the transit center I'd boarded a giant Martin Mars flying boat for the final leg of the flight that was boy it turned out it was because that and when they did come in at night we saw him come in the mid-no-fammer and uh... major battle between the naval battle called the naval battle called al canal and uh... you never know watching at night time you didn't know who's your our ships and which are theirs all sent you see something blow up you see red hot shells being fired going back and criss-crossing fact back and forth so then you guys later that day and enemy unit penetrator online and ambush weapons patoon killing three marines with a burst of enemy fire with with a burst of machine gun fire and then the entire offensive had suddenly been called off and not only that we're gonna give up the ground we had taken relinquishing it to the japanese what the hell we thought so you get told hey you guys stop attacking the reason was which you'll get into in this a bit is that there's a major task force the japanese but twelve transfers full of troops can you imagine and uh... battleship and cruisers and lot of destroyers and they they were gonna they were gonna just knock us off of there we had we had we didn't have a good feel that it was that dire but yeah here we go the signal is given our coxons shifts out of neutral pushes the throttle wide open the engine bellows betch's belch's smoke the stern dips the men in the boat rock back slightly as the boat leaps forward now we're barreling toward the island our boat all the boat 600 men more less of the first battalion eight marines water churning boiling behind the boat we're bucketing and bouncing bullying ahead with our squared off bow musseling the water aside the boat is throwing spray soaking us and we're getting closer closer to the island we're about 800 yards from the shore when zip zip zip we hear tiny objects flying past and those aren't hornets boys their bullets we're in the range of the Japanese machine guns and good I know so get some soap and stay clean also we have youtube channel on the industry to stay in the video version of this podcast we want to see what we look like even at me maybe jocco actually I know it's not like you know it didn't lad looks like so we'd rolled them over and stick their faces in the dirt so we couldn't so they couldn't see the sun our guys would cut off fingers and make fobs which believe are not with the finger of the japs finger hanging down and they'd go out there with the knives and pliers trying to pull out gold teeth but if some of us truly relished but if some of them men truly relished battle embraced and enjoyed it enjoyed the killing the brutality the horror all of it it is important to establish that on the continuum of brutal human behavior the rest of us were not all that far removed from them and we tended to move closer as the war went on some manner more capable than others when it comes to killing but all men are capable one way we improved on this capability such improvement being vital to our effectiveness as Marines not to mention our very survival was to look on our enemy as hateful creatures less than human from a psychological standpoint it became easy to kill them we were killing animals not men and after killing them we would look upon their dead bodies and feel nothing no remorse no guilt no horror pity or whatever from there it was just a small step to place in the geography of the mind we were pulling gold teeth out of corpses was not all that outrageous but now many were doing that there's just a few crazy guys doing it and one of my one of my sergeants that did that and he had a whole had a whole pocket full and for some reason rather something happy changes fans or something and they were all so I'll get some more i was somebody it was gonna kill him now we had a dog a dog going on all right the eighth Marines first and second battians were to advance by side in columns in tourvine then attack and capture hill 83 ridge line the first battalion was to move forward on the right be company would lead in the battians advance and my platoon would lead the company's advance so that you put you does that put your company right your your company right at the front and I said the enemy dehumanizes themselves with their what their actions that they would take and that's the same situation here you know the in Iraq the insurgents would be head people and skin people alive and just do absolutely horrible I don't know what the Turks seem to be doing that right now it seems like I don't know that's a thing cleansing and one of the guys Sandy and the others had to reach the bloody remains for dog tags that would identify their friends discovering which one of their friends they were charging and hunger if I own people were killed most of them soldiers they went right through them you say that this bonsai this bonsai resulted in as near as I can determine from what I saw and what I've read the Japanese lost upward of 4,000 men some 500 Americans were killed most of them from the army the two battalions that were overrun and nearly wiped out each battery suffered 150 two casualties in the attack 75 killed or 6 wounded they got completely your run it's estimated that some 600 Japanese were killed on the open ground directly in front of the batteries guns I'll tell you this guy this guy Tani he told me all or the space we've had yassikuni shrine and the you know the in person if he had less than all that kind of stuff and just a lot and then went into a a TV studio and all that kind of stuff is incredible and any any point or doubt you know I think it was so fire bomb you know it all this is all new yeah he took Lund's death very hard gunner Lund was a popular figure and B company an old salt who was trusted and respected for his courage competence and common sense battle wisdom and loved for his tough his rough humor and for the obvious and genuine affection and concerned he felt for his young charges before the war he had been sea going marine serving on the beloved aircraft the Lexington he'd always been smoking a cigar how we was able to keep himself stock with stowies on guano canals anyone's guess such of the talents of an old salt he used to say that after the war he was going to buy himself a big shiny cattle act convertible and ride around smoking his cigars instead of that high visit his family after the war he had a sister that had been to a dance and they couldn't find her anywhere she was dead in the trunk they found her body in the trunk of the car been murdered missed they were missed handling money there's many money where they shouldn't have been so a lot of those going on you probably heard about and then the new secretary fan came down he did he just changed the whole thing around so we wrapped this up the section on January on 31 January the one eight and the entire second regiment boarded the troop transport crescent city and then during the first week of February the Japanese managed to evacuate more than 11,000 troops a minor triumph that did little to offset the magnets you do there to feet they lost upward of 25,000 men in Guadalcanal campaign of these maybe a thousand were taken prisoner our losses were comparatively small according to army historians about 1600 were killed and 4,245 were wounded on nine February the rest of the eighth Marines left Guadalcanal on board the troop ship hunter ligate at American Legion that same day Guadalcanal was declared secure one way or another for the living and the dead the fighting on Guadalcanal was over forever so your next chapter here is called heaven so I jumped and ran to a nearby hole which wasn't easy you know because my pants and my drawers were down around my ankles and so because I haven't read the entire book you know you talk about Murdoch and I've mentioned that he was a character and you know obviously you mentioned that he liked drink and one of the people he was in alcoholic a lot of time he finally got over but we don't expect to go where the fighting is hottest and we expect to go soon we circle and circle in the lagoon we're standing in the boat either leaning against the sides or holding on them for balance in general we have a soft ride because the water is mostly still except for the turbulence caused by all the boats the turbulence buffets the LCVPs and this movement combined with the stench of the engine and the nervous tension we all feel makes many of a sick some of the sick men some of the sick men stick their heads over the sides to stretch while there's puke into the wooden deck the men standing next to them just step aside like it's no big deal to get sick because it really isn't a big deal when the men when the sick men finish wretched they straighten up as if nothing had happened no one thinks the worst of them for it after a while depending on how long we're out there in the boat the deck might be slippery with puke and you you would think anybody that's seen a 50 caliber machine gun you'd think everyone in that building would be dead but what i'd one guy get wounded it wasn't actually all that bad and so when you see the the that's why you can never trust that you know big bombs are going to actually solve the problem it doesn't always happen and this is a classic example of that and the main reason that naval gun fire wasn't wasn't all that effective is that we're just only you know the land was only about six foot above sea level but the fact is i'm just 23 years old still young and not all that grizzled in appearance or temperament practically speaking though i'm the graveyard of this bunch same goes for the platoon sergeant who's about my age where the tribal elders the warrior chiefs i'll lead my boys off the boat and the platoon sergeant standing in the back will make sure they follow urging them and conjolling them yelling at them maybe throwing a few choice cuss words whatever it takes to get them moving i'm watching my boys as they watch me things begin to happen fast with the majors lzvp leading the way our boats break formation one after the other and file off to our departure line this is an invisible line about 6,000 yards offshore that runs parallel to the landing beaches when we get there our boats are form up all the inline abreast arrayed like a cavalry squadron waiting for the bugle to sound charge the coxons rev and gun the engines in neutral gear and the boats are rearing and lurching trump charting at the bit it's as if the coxons are struggling to rain in war horses that can't contain their eagerness for battle our boats engine is blasting the noise almost painful to the years we're pumped up my men it doesn't make any sense and also all script is all screwed up it was all about a guy that was going through a going through some kind of a psychological thing and hurry's talking he's talking to the the kernel in charge of the of the of the of the hospital that he's at you know that you're talking to the carman you know stuff like that it's like a desert for the desert so many asked me if we're gonna make pumpkin spice uh milk what like seasonal or seasonal even if it's wrong no man do it because that reminds me of pumpkin spice latte which I know is like a thing for people with like weird hipsters I'm hit over here they're calling out as loud as they can I see men going under often for the last time what do I do I keep moving forward that's what cries for help everywhere and I ignore them I have to you get hot you get hit you just have to keep going you have to cope with it yourself do the best you can hope for the best the sounds of battle are everywhere there are those sweeping slashing curtains of fire dozens of machine guns rattling a a cacophony of staccato hammering artillery shells exploding in the water splashing throwing up washing gaizers of water and human body parts and most especially most memory the shouts and screams of the wounded in the dying oh the script might be horrible out the combat scenes for me they were unbelievable unbelievable the any actually we have your book I was I was saying while they did a great job because one thing that I was said to myself you know it's you know when some of the fire fights the night fire fights it's just flashes and they're like but that's good grim and resigned look means they've more or less accepted this situation which is also good because the situation isn't going to change unless it changes for the worse this whole thing is on the rails it's a runaway train and there's nothing going to stop it now if you know this if you accept it you can keep your fear under control and if you can keep your fear under control you'll do your job you won't let your buddies down so we're doing fine relatively speaking the boat is racing toward the shore when crying scraping bottom metal grinding on coral it abruptly stops we're thrown forward cursing we've run a ground all along the reef it's the same boat grinding to a halt on base yours fringing reef right up there I don't know if we I don't know specifically because no I don't know I don't know talk of that hill as you get it was a big night above on the top now it'd be just in the North towards Shepard shell it's calm and warm like bath water almost soothing a pleasant contrast to the still cool morning air it's murky though sand and coral all stirred up beneath the surface none of that crystalline purity that comes to mind when you picture a tropical lagoon war comes to paradise and literally fouls it up i look sure word only 600 yards to go now the fellow that reached down and pulled me up over the ramp here a few months ago we ran across a photograph of him and what did it look like and a little bit of reference to his family but never never made a contact now this is as of within six months or so ago so this is and nobody and nobody else i talked to really knew who this guy was he was new to the outfit he was the sergeant he was new huh i looked around at my man who gave that order most of my men had gone to ground hiding in the bush as and were invisible to the Japanese that's the nature of jungle warfare everyone tries to stay hidden you can hardly see anyone either enemy or friendly the battlefield seems empty and you feel and you can feel alone and isolated on it especially when you're in command especially when in the middle of a firefight and when somebody else starts giving orders to your men I looked around and a few of the men I could see stared back at me there there are ex-blank expressions a firm denial it wasn't me a few minutes later de Moss and his squad returned to the ravine having relinquished their brief hold on the ridge top somebody although us to get off de Moss explained he thought one of our guys had given the order then we both realized what had happened those clever Japanese one of them someone flutten American English had given that order very clever he must be pleased with himself he must be laughing at us just about now him and his men laughing but like Dean's you know we we we covered the primary jocopotcast type stuff from him but Dean has other information for us other things that we talk about that that is the perfect way to put it back so there you go so subscribe to those podcasts and also if you want to get some some soap because you probably need soap in fact I'm going to go and say you do need soap get from Irish Oaks Ranch dot com from young aid and who's making soap on his farm from goats it's not allowed to sell goat milk in California because speaking of communists they like to control everything out there yeah we were we were spearheading that particular attack you know you talk about you you mentioned to win be right a little earlier and that's a heck of a nick name then doesn't sound like it's easy for a couple and thought about that true on the night of 30 to 31 November a Japanese task force steamed in the sea large channel of bringing food to the Belieger Japanese forces on Guadalcanal our warships sailed forth to intercept it meeting the enemy fleet in that off-to-speweded gap between savvoiled and Guadalcanal just off Tassa Farango how do you say that it's right Tassa Farango point because our Bivolac was situated inland on low ground I heard the battle but did not see it our fleet took an awful beating one of our heavy cruisers the North Hampton was struck by two torpedoes within a matter of seconds consumed by fire she sank a few hours later you're still sure the heavy crew cruisers Minneapolis Minneapolis New Orleans and Pensacola were severely damaged and the sailors were coming off off of an off cover with oil and so would they swim into shore some did probably did it was right near the shore yeah if you want to drink some you can try some discipline some discipline go some discipline powder and right now I'm completely on this kick of the jockel pomer which is the best thing I've ever been so the discipline go you know the energy drink the cans is that discipline go or just go it's like discipline and we believed it at the same briefing a battle ship captain declared we are going to bombard at six thousand yards we've got so much armor we're not afraid of anything the japs control back at us the commander of the second marine division major general julian c-smith was in sense to buy the captains brave words gentlemen he retorted remember one thing when the Marines land and meet the enemy at bay net point the only armor a marine will have is his khaki shirt it is unbelievable though when you see the bombardment you can see film of the bombardment at Taroa i mean they just look like it was just obliterators
