Again, it's, it's one of those things where, you know, you wrote this book as, you know, as you're saying like a cultural philosophy, you know, like, life and I wrote Extreme Ownership as, oh, as leadership principles, but I mean it didn't take, but two seconds for everyone to say, And, you know, I think, I think one of these things that happens with, you know, these ideas behind socialism in America and again, it's, it's like crazy that we would be sitting here talking about this, anybody that, anybody that reads anything about history knows that this is just not good, but, you know, it comes across always as, Hey, well, what we want to do is help everyone out. And, okay, if that's like the core belief and this is where I think sometimes we could do better or, you know, someone like myself could do a better job explaining to people, look, if you care about other human beings, so much, if you want to help as many people as possible in this country, the best possible thing you could do is allow the market to flourish, allow people to build businesses. You know, I'll tell you, you know, those pictures, was it the kind like, oh, after they got into like the medical, you know what? Oh yeah, those milk bars, you're going to, it's funny because, you know, how kids are the kind of the litmus test, you know, like, if you give the kid like, let's say back in the day, right? That was just all just extra money just hidden in the in the in the treasury that we could just give out, but we don't want to that everybody that we have all these luxury apartments that we could just give out, you know, because housing is a right or whatever or that or that there's just enough doctors and hospitals to take care of everyone and they're just kind of waiting around like not, you know, I mean like come on. I was like, my line was something along the lines of like, you know, in this life, like try or not to offend people, but also try really hard not to be offended. So that's how, you know, it's like, you know, all these groups of people, like, very small groups of people, but they're super loud because they can be now. And if there's ever a reason you need to get up in the morning, not at 430, but like later, you know, get a normal human time, then the boys who wish they could get up, you know, that's a good reason, because they would like to be able to get up and they can't. Yeah, I know, a thick skin and, you know, the ability to verbally spar with people 24 hours a day from the moment you report into work, the moment you show up until, and any mistake that you make, you better, you know, you, you throw a shot on a, you know, while you're shooting, you throw a shot and hit something that you shouldn't hate or whatever. But, uh, you know, so it's like, you know, always that it's kind of going back to be still like, is there a chance that there's more to this story? And then see it, you know, it, it, it's always interesting to be a part of things like that that you don't really know, like, I mean, you don't really understand what you're doing at the time. It's funny how like when you're in a position like you are and I am in, you know, people like they hit you up on social media. Like being like on an air, like, if imagine you're like going through a cumulus cloud as you're taking off. Like work when no one's watching, you know, it's like just really simple stuff, but it's like, it's who you better be. You know, I was like, like my response was like, kind of funny. And we sometimes see that as a virtue like like the big, I know like the, the dude from the big LeBouceking, that guy doesn't care about anything. So I was like in a I was like in a like a like a root off the red nose reindeer Christmas world. Now what we should do, but what we should be, and that's a really interesting thing, and I, and I, and I note that, you, you look at a, like, a corporate ethos, and if you go to people like corporations websites and you read them, they're, they're usually something like, we want to be the number one manufacturer on the West Coast. Like they're like they you know because in like a lot of these countries. And then there was a bunch of other, you know, look, as you know, as we know, like we're in the news a lot. These people who kind of live by this notion of, you know, social, progressivism and freedom, but fundamentally, they believe in a kind of Republican form of government that is out of your life and, you know, fiscally responsible, you know, they live by this mantra, well, I'm socially liberal but fiscally conservative. I'm always amazed by how little pockets put into some of these you know feel good policy policy proposals like as if there's no second third order consequences to these things and like you just you have to think through that. It's called no plan B, which is, you know, got a little counterintuitive sound to it because as a seal, and as a human being, you're always like, oh, you know, you got to have a plan B in case something goes wrong. And that shows you, you know, the kind of people that you're talking about, you know, someone that's taking their own personal worst nightmare that any, you know, any parent could ever have of losing their kid and immediately saying, well, what can I do for you guys? And like, you better go after each other, but it better be funny, you know, it's got to actually, and like, we rely on that dark humor and a really fundamental way. You know, you're just trying to get the job done, you're trying to do a good job, but you don't always know what the impact is going to be later when you, when you do something like that, but you have some honor to be out there and make that happen or help make that happen again. And then I, and I get again into kind of a religious discussion here about like our morality and like how we actually know right from wrong. So there's a difference between that and then like, someone being like, a weight guys and bust up the phone and start taking pictures, like, which is what you think a team guy would do. And so I'm not even loading by it's moving boxes from here in the warehouse to where they're going to get loaded on trucks to get to shipped out you know you know who wants that job a kid that's a. 16 years old that you know that needs gas money and he's going to work that job two hours a night You want to hear a little story that I tell myself, whenever I get some kind of like little injury, even if it's like a more significant injury, maybe something that's going to make take me out of off my training schedule for a month, right? So when we start talking about what the problem with is with our troops, what a good leader does is says, okay, there's these, I need to treat this guy with, I need to make some maneuvers here to get this person on board with the program because it's not like some young army guys, like I don't want to do a good job. You know, and it's, again, the good news is, is like people listening like, well, I haven't seen it. We always hear that, you know, the guys when I got to the teams, it was like the guys from the 70s were like, oh, the guys from the 80s are weak. It's not like some person at a tech company, some person that just graduated from college and went to a tech company's like, you know what, I don't want to do well here. It sounds like everyone else was just like, hey man, you know, isn't it going to work? And I think it was like I think it was like right after my first surgery or maybe right before I don't remember. Like, South Korea is testing 20,000 people a day, and we've only done like, you know, 10,000 tests or something. But they're like, hey, if my boss would just get on board with this concept, you know, like, yeah, that would be problems with my team would just take ownership. You know, and so, that my wife is like, I am so sick of hearing you can play in about the where she's like, she hates this chapter because she's so used to the seal team culture. You know, like, just maybe, like, there's a reason your granddad is telling you it's this way. So that you can focus on the big stuff because, you know, seals like to complain about wet socks, like a lot. It's not like they're just more tech, you know, some people will say, well, you know, the new generation's more tech savvy. You know, if you want to be better at running up a mountain, run up a mountain like, you know, so the actor preparedness. And like you and I both know, I'm like, hey, man, that's something that probably has been said to him a hundred times in a platoon space somewhere. You know what's interesting, as, as, you know, before we start recording, you know, we're just talking about kind of life in the games. And at first again the minimum wage it seems like the right thing to do like people should just get paid more I want them to get paid more they should. You know, like really simple lessons, because we look up to the Jedi as like a hero archetype. You know, and I, and I point out, like, changing directions in life could seem like quitting. Like, like, especially, you know, on the way. It's almost like this challenging like you better do this or I'll never, never like you again. She's not sure what my face looks like because they don't know what my face looks like. You know, like let's, let's be gracious with how we understand each other, just like just a tad. You know, I was like, I was like, yeah, You know, like, whoa, what does it look like to be over the edge on that? Like, they were just like, I don't know what's wrong with this guy. And, you know, it started because I'm like, you know, I get these five-minute conversations during hearings when I have a really interesting witness come and talk about something. Um, you know, it's, it's, it's, I mean, I, it's like, you know, 21,000 vision.
