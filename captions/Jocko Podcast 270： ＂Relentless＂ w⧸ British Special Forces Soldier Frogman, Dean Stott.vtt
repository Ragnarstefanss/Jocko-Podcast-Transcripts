00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
This is Jocco podcast number 270 with echo Charles and me, Jocco willing. Good evening, echo. Good evening.

2
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
I'd made a mistake that was going to cost me my life.

3
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
I turned to the man beside me. He was a young manny.

4
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000
We called him H and he was the only passenger in the beat up local car I was driving.

5
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
The air around us with stiff, with heat and tension.

6
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
The vehicle almost rocking as the press of humanity outside began to shove towards me, pointing.

7
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.000
I kept my eyes down, not out of fear, but so that they didn't get a good look at them through the dirty glass.

8
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
I knew exactly what had happened. How they'd spotted me.

9
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
I was dressed head to toe as a local, from flip flops to a turban.

10
00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:03.000
I had a dyed beard and my skin colored, but what I hadn't added to my disguise was my brown contact lenses.

11
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
And now my bright blue eyes were drawing the locals in to point and stare.

12
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
I knew it was only a matter of minutes before the neighborhood bad guys started slipping out of their hiding places.

13
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
And tonight I could look forward to an orange jump suit.

14
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:31.000
The last thing the world would see of me was the image of a former special forces soldier about to meet his end courtesy of an enemy unfamiliar with the Geneva convention.

15
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Bullocks. I wanted to talk to H. I wanted to the local man's opinion. But if the people outside saw my lips moving in a funny way, then we were truly fucked.

16
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:56.000
And so instead I raised an eyebrow and hope that people would just think I was commenting on the traffic that had packed us into this bustling marketplace.

17
00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:04.000
H. gave a shrug and reply as if to say, what can you do? What could I do?

18
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Get my head chopped off or go out fighting. Those seem to be the choices. I knew which one I'd choose if it came down to it.

19
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:20.000
But I couldn't help but hear the voice in the back of my head. The voice that had told me always, you'll never last two minutes in the army.

20
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Well, if this was the end, I'd show them how wrong they were. I'd been showing them for years.

21
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.000
This wasn't my first covert mission as a civilian. I'd cut my teeth as a special forces soldier.

22
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
And as such, I'd had my metal tested again and again.

23
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000
I tried to remember that as yet another local pointed at me and began waving towards my door.

24
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
I pretended to be busy looking ahead at traffic and checked the mirror behind me.

25
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
No sign of our second car.

26
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
I wanted to rub my eyes despite the danger I was knackered.

27
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Maybe that's why I had made the mistake.

28
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Maybe that was why I had to get on my radio, hidden away out of sight from the Yemenis who continue to walk by peering in and pointing at me.

29
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.000
I kept my message short trying to move my lips as little as possible.

30
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
I've been compromised.

31
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.000
My mate Sam came on the net from the second vehicle. He was out of sight.

32
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
But I was sure that he couldn't be more than a hundred meters away.

33
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
Are you compromised? Over?

34
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
He asked. I confirmed that I was.

35
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000
Are you happy with the immediate action drill? Over?

36
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
I knew that drill off by heart.

37
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:53.000
The first part would involve me pulling a snub nose machine gun from beneath my seat and emptying a full magazine into the wind screen.

38
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
This would send a very loud signal that it was a good idea for people to get away from me.

39
00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.000
It would buy me seconds to grab my wrapped up assault rifle, wedge between the seat and the door and exit the vehicle.

40
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000
Then me and my flip flops would be racing for the nearest safe house.

41
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
Sam came back on the net.

42
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
You're called out.

43
00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
My call.

44
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
When it comes down to it, the biggest moments in your life always are.

45
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:31.000
I thought about letting out a deep breath, but looking ice cool in front of each was important to me.

46
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
Fear is contagious.

47
00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
And so I put mine on a shelf until I got clear of the situation.

48
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
Instead, I imagined everything that was about to happen in this shitstorm.

49
00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
Bloody hell, I almost laughed to myself.

50
00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
All this over a pair of contact lenses.

51
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
I looked at H, gave him the slightest of nods.

52
00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
He was probably sending up a prayer at that point.

53
00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
Maybe more than one.

54
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
My own thoughts went to my wife and children.

55
00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.000
If someone wanted to stop me seeing them again, then I promised it would be a fight like no other.

56
00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000
And then with the thought of my family pumping like fire through my veins,

57
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:27.000
I reached below my seat and to call them my weapon.

58
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.000
And that is the opening of a book.

59
00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
The book is called relentless.

60
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:43.000
And is written by someone named Dean Stott, who is a British soldier.

61
00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
Who served as an engineer in the commandos.

62
00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
And eventually went on to the British special forces.

63
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:56.000
Selection and became one of the first army soldiers to opt into joining the special boat service.

64
00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
Counter-part to the British SAS.

65
00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
And that is just the beginning of this story.

66
00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:14.000
And luckily for us, Dean is here himself to help talk us through his experiences in the military and beyond.

67
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
Thanks for coming aboard.

68
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.000
It's been a long time that we have been getting requests to have a Brit on here.

69
00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
So you're the first.

70
00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
Well, we had one photographer who had been to Iraq.

71
00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:34.000
But I think you're our first British military person. There's been a lot of requests.

72
00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
Great. So glad to have you here, man.

73
00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.000
No pressure.

74
00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
The whole nation is riding on your shoulders.

75
00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:52.000
So that's the beginning of this book and the beginning of the books starts off.

76
00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:59.000
It's sort of the middle of your operational career when you talk about the military operations and the civilian operations.

77
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:10.000
But I guess we should start at the beginning. I always like to start at the beginning of, you know, where you came from and how you ended up in this particular situation in life.

78
00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
Yeah, let's get to it.

79
00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:22.000
So I was born into military family. My father, he was in the Royal Engineers and, so very much immersed in that environment.

80
00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.000
I grew up in a town called Old Ashot, which was the home of the British Army. So it's just airborne heavy.

81
00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:33.000
Yeah, two parrots. He had three parrots there. I'd never even heard of the raw Marines or the special boat service.

82
00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
I mean, it was just SES and airborne.

83
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:47.000
And my father and my mother, they ended up splitting up when I was quite a young age by the age of eight. My mother left my father and took me my sisters to Manchester up north.

84
00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:55.000
And we ended up in a homeless home in Mosside. And Mosside back in the 80s was the roughest estate in the whole of the UK.

85
00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
Now when Brits say a state, yeah.

86
00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:06.000
When you're in American, say a state, they're thinking of like a country, a state of everything houses when Brits say a state you're talking about the ghetto.

87
00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.000
Yeah, so it's a ghetto.

88
00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.000
And it's a government housing, right? Is that what it's, isn't a government housing estate? That's where the word estate comes from.

89
00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:21.000
Yeah, they call them counts of the states. And yeah, obviously to get your name on on the housing market, you have to then go into a homeless home.

90
00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:31.000
So that's what we did. We ended up in a homeless shelter in Mosside. And you know, I was the only white me and my sisters, the only Caucasians in the area. So we were attracting attention from an early start.

91
00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:46.000
The, you know, this soon ended up with me learning how to fight with my fist quite early. You know, protecting my sisters in the school play around. Actually, I ended up having to leave that school because too many fighting and we moved to another another place of Manchester.

92
00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:56.000
My mother, we then got housed in my father, however, used to travel up and pick us up every other weekend. It's about 240 mile drive one way and take us back down.

93
00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:06.000
My father very close, my sister was very close to my mother. And three years later, my father got custody, you know, of me, my sisters.

94
00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:13.000
Well, that's, that is that hard, I mean, America, it's pretty hard for a, especially a military dude to get custody.

95
00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:34.000
Yeah, over the mom. Yeah, no, there was it. I think obviously, you know, he, he put his career on pause. He got promoted to regiment or son, Major was posted to Germany and he said, no, I want to stay in UK. I want to look after my kids. And so he put his whole career online. And I think the judge at the time didn't want to siblings split up.

96
00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:46.000
You know, he didn't want like two sisters being in Manchester and the sun down south. So the judge said, no, the children made the decision and being the oldest at the age of about 10 and a half, I had to make that quite hard decision.

97
00:09:47.000 --> 00:10:00.000
And so when I want to live live with my father and he got custody and I, and you know, even to the day I remember the day that my mom dropped his off and the reaction she saw with my father took us away. You know, that sticks with you something something like that.

98
00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:11.000
But for me, we moved back down to older shots and you know, I'm very close to my father. I never actually wanted to pursue a career in the military myself as you always want to be a fireman.

99
00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:26.000
But we grew up around there, but my dad is, it was a Scottsman. It was old school sergeant, Major. He was old school through him through. And I remember finishing like junior school and we went on to what you call high school secondary school.

100
00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:31.000
So this is what age what age is this? Well, I would have been about 13 at this age.

101
00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:44.000
So at 13, you've been living with your dad for a few years now. And you're seeing the military, but you're still not quite. You're not quite like enthralled by it.

102
00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:59.000
Yeah, yeah, and I was, as I say, when I was immersed, that our school playground was where the red devil used to take off, which is the British parachute and free fall teams. Every day you'd see the parachutes. The guys would be walking around in the uniforms in their maroon berries.

103
00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:11.000
And it was just, it was almost like the norm living in older shots. So, but my father was now going to transition out the military. My father, his career wasn't very,

104
00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:31.000
he was more sports. He was what we would call a track suit soldier. He was very good at sport and soccer was here. So he was the army manager coach and player. So I very rarely saw my father in green kit. He knows it was more track suit trainers and on the football pitch. So I didn't really know much about the military and and the layout of the military.

105
00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:49.000
And was he going on deployments? He went on deployments to like Northern Ireland, but when he then got custody of the kids, you know, that obviously stopped him going on any deployments. And this was a period of time actually, you know, the last conflict was 1982, which was the fault.

106
00:11:49.000 --> 00:12:03.000
So there's a dry period up until now. We had the gold for in 91, but that was still to come actually. I was two years, two years later. So other than Northern Ireland, there wasn't really any sort of overseas deployments. So it didn't, didn't really affect him going away.

107
00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:17.000
But he was now coming to the end of his career and transitioning to civil street. So growing up in older shot in his military schools, he then decided to put me in secondary school in the local town. It's called North Camp.

108
00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:32.000
But being old school my father dressed me up day one in a blazer carrying like a brief case, a brief case. You know, wasn't even real leather. That was more of a set of them. But my hair was was a croaker.

109
00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:46.000
You know, rather than going downtown and pay for a normal haircut, my father would take me to camp and just put me in straight the front of the queue of all the recruits. And that's legit. Yeah, so I really stood out when I turned up his school day one, I stood out.

110
00:12:46.000 --> 00:13:14.000
So is this school like a what we call an America private school where you have to pay to go to or what was different? No, it was a public school, but it wasn't in a military town. It was next to the military town. So the children and went there, their parents weren't from the military because it was so close to older shot. There was a lot of rivalry between and so their haircut just just I just stood out and yeah, unfortunately a week later, I got suspended from that school for fighting.

111
00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:35.000
Like were you just that angry you, sir? What? No, I just think I'll just put in some really awkward positions and that that being one, but I always remember my father. I know you guys do brisseling jigsuit soon. No, my father again always taught me to fight with my fists and as soon as the guy we call that scarist jigsuit.

112
00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:53.000
But as soon as the opponent's down, you know you stop, you got the bear of them and there's no like follow up like there isn't nowadays. So I also nervous when I got home and I sort of left the left a letter on the table and quickly ran upstairs to the toilet.

113
00:13:53.000 --> 00:14:13.000
My father, you know, screamed out my name and I come down and his one question was, did you hit him when he was down? I said no, he said that's fine. And then I had to then explain to him. I said look, you dressed me in this this and he heaps his fore. He was doing good by me when he fact is bringing too far too much attention.

114
00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:25.000
We then left that she not a few months after that and moved out into the country, totally away from many sort of military town and that was almost the start for me. That was a start of a new life.

115
00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:31.000
You know, I'd left that military background behind me. So how old are you now? I'm probably about 14 now.

116
00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:37.000
Right on and then you get to where do you move to when you got this new start?

117
00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:46.000
So moved to into Surrey. So it's just south of London that's more very very green country the country exactly.

118
00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:55.000
And now did you, how was that? Was that like a you said it was a new start because you were able to fit in a little bit better.

119
00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
Your dad didn't shave your head and said, you're school.

120
00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:05.000
Yeah, exactly. It was so milky bar. But it was also that no one could judge you. You sort of left your your passport behind you. No manchester fighting.

121
00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:18.000
And you know, it's almost like this is the baseline you start from now. So, and again, it was actually nice to socialize with kids who parents were in it is learning stuff that was out that military lifestyle.

122
00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:23.000
You know, all my friends back in older shot, their dad's all their born because my dad wasn't they called him a hat.

123
00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:32.000
It I mean, it was just like you didn't have any that. I didn't have to prove anything to them or feel like, you know, because your father's career, your part of that.

124
00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:38.000
And that's what older show was like, it was like, well, what rank is your father? Is he a power or is he not? And he's like, oh God.

125
00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:55.000
I had a friend who was Australian, essay, us and he was saying, you know, him and his wife were talking and he was like, they're they're having an expression. It was like, oh, they're wife wears the rank of the family. So it's like, oh, we, you know, he's lieutenant Colonel, who are you?

126
00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:03.000
It sounds like, but I can imagine little kids telling me my dad's not airborne. Oh, yeah, that's for a great. What I call a hat.

127
00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:18.000
It's just saying that the parachute regiment call him hat. I didn't know where we say helly airborne troop, but it's it's not they're just calling them a hat because they, they don't have the moonberry. And then, you know, somebody army commandos also take on that terminology and call them call them hats or screamers.

128
00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:31.000
We, in the army, the American army, they call someone that's not airborne. A leg. And it said, was such a dissade. I remember what I wear to airborne school. I come here. You nasty leg.

129
00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:45.000
And then in the, in the Navy, the, the aviation guys, people that aren't in helicopters or jets or whatever planes, they wear brown shoes. It's part of their uniforms.

130
00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:54.000
So they call in a derogatory way. They call anybody that's not a brown shoe, which no one's used that turn, but they call everyone out to black shoe.

131
00:16:54.000 --> 00:17:09.000
And so then in the team, we take that one step further and like the derogatory, who's that guy? Some shoe came over and told us if we couldn't wear that whatever. So that's, it's funny how you get these little little, little words.

132
00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:16.000
But hat, yeah, hat is the parachute regiment and then the Marines obviously from the army, it's pongo.

133
00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:22.000
No, anyway, you go the little kids tell you your dad's hat.

134
00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:29.000
Yeah, and again, no wonder you had to fight on the regular basis. Yeah, if it was able and I'll probably be no right.

135
00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:39.000
And then so, so you end up in, in Surrey, you're in the country, do you feel like your life's taken a better direction to your dad was a good, great athlete apparently?

136
00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:44.000
What did you inherit that athleticism and love for the game?

137
00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:54.000
I did, yeah, I think that's where, you know, I'm very competitive. I like to compete and I think that's, you know, from my father, you know, even to the on Christmas day with the board game.

138
00:17:54.000 --> 00:18:01.000
I'm very competitive. You, you had to win, you know, and, you know, so I did inherit that from him.

139
00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:10.000
Sport wise, and I, I followed in his footsteps, you know, played, played football as well. I wasn't great at sport, but I just tried everything.

140
00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:15.000
You know, I was very fortunate at school. I ended up getting sports personality the year award. It sounds amazing.

141
00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:16.000
That's a pretty much it.

142
00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:23.000
But I wasn't the best at football. I wasn't the best at rugby. You know, I just helped out. You know, if they said, right, we need someone on the basketball team.

143
00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:34.000
I don't really know basketball, but I would step in. So, so I saw it, I had that from my father, but, and I think that's what helped later on in the military career.

144
00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:40.000
You know, I always found myself competing with others or having to prove prove a point or being a ambassador.

145
00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:45.000
Well, that's two different things actually. Prove a point or being a ambassador. Yeah.

146
00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:52.000
I don't know how that's, that's like, that's two different things, right? If I'm trying to prove a point as one thing from trying to be,

147
00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:58.000
one's going to come at you, the ambassador is going to be cool. So you found that nice middle ground between those two things.

148
00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:05.000
Yeah, well, I found myself that, you know, when you're in the army and you're working alongside Marines, you're an ambassador for your cat batch.

149
00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:11.000
If that makes sense, you know what I mean? Then when you go to the SBS, from the army, you're an ambassador for the British army.

150
00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:16.000
When you're on Jocco's podcast and you're the first British guy, you're the first of the British, aren't you?

151
00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:22.000
Well, it's proven a point to myself into them, but almost represent in your unit or your cat batch.

152
00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:27.000
So you talked about, you wanted to be a fireman in the book, you in the book.

153
00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:36.000
You sounds like at some point you realize there's a lot of applicants to be a fireman and like thousands of applicants to be a fireman.

154
00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.000
It's sort of like an America, we get a similar thing here.

155
00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.000
Yeah. You realized it's probably not going to happen.

156
00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:47.000
Yeah, well back to the school in my father again being old school, he wouldn't let me go out and play unless I did my homework.

157
00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:53.000
So he would check everything. So in school wise, I did quite well. I didn't look beyond school. I didn't look at college.

158
00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:58.000
I thought I was just going to join the fire brigade and he had to be 18 anyway, so I was still under age.

159
00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:03.000
And at that time, there was a big recession. And I was 2,000 applicants for one job.

160
00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:14.000
I went to college, every summer holidays as a young kid, my father would take me my sisters down to southwest of England to Cornwall and we would go surfing.

161
00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:20.000
So I've been surfing since a young boy. So during college, we had a 2 week summer holiday.

162
00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.000
So me and my mates were out, let's go down to Newkey.

163
00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:29.000
Not on an M-Surf, but they just wanted to try and find girls. So we all went down to Newkey for 2 weeks.

164
00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:34.000
I was in the water all day and they're just just sounding a beach doing their thing.

165
00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:43.000
And I met a Norwegian guy called Yarn. And he just got chatting and he was a silver surf his waiter at the local hotel.

166
00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:47.000
So a fish tall beach is actually on the surf tour, the pro surf tour.

167
00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:54.000
And a fish tall beach hotel is on the peninsula. He said, well, I'm getting £30 a day. I surf breakfast.

168
00:20:54.000 --> 00:21:00.000
I get free breakfast. I serve a surf all day. Then in the evening I served even in meal and I get free meal.

169
00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:07.000
I get £30 a pound in my pocket. It's only £10 for the hostel. I've been in entrepreneurship for that. I'll have a piece of that.

170
00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:10.000
So two weeks later, my father came to pick us up.

171
00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:18.000
And this is now where you're talking 94 long before any mobile phones and things that I wasn't in the car park with my friends.

172
00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:22.000
And my dad's that always deen. And they said, he's staying.

173
00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:25.000
So your friends met your dad.

174
00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:30.000
Yeah, my dad dropped his off and he came back to pick us up two weeks later. But I wasn't there.

175
00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:34.000
Yeah, so again, I just didn't want to confront my dad. And I didn't want to go back to college.

176
00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.000
So I just didn't want to get into an argument.

177
00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:39.000
So when you got done with what we call high school, how old are you?

178
00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:44.000
So we're about 16. Okay. So then your college starts after that.

179
00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:48.000
And this is taking place during this two week break. You go down there. You're surfing.

180
00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:54.000
Yeah, you're living the dream. And you see this Norwegian cat that's got it all figured out.

181
00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.000
And you figured you're in.

182
00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:59.000
Yeah, that's my life full planned out. I'll the roadmap.

183
00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:03.000
And my father then came back six months later. You know, looking for me.

184
00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:06.000
And he found me working in a local surf shop.

185
00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:09.000
And he said, you know, right, you've messed up your education.

186
00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:14.000
That's it. Your life is over. You know, giving it all these little one liners.

187
00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:18.000
So for me to really just silence him. I just said, well, I'll join the army.

188
00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:22.000
And you normally expect so warm, come from words from your father.

189
00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:25.000
But I've sort of met with a response. You'd last two minutes.

190
00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:31.000
And probably wasn't the response I wanted. But I thought, okay, no, just no point in getting into an argument.

191
00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:33.000
And the best thing to do is try and prove him wrong.

192
00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:40.000
But I was about five foot seven and 65 kilos. So I could probably see where he was coming from at the time.

193
00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:44.000
But he drove me back down to Surrey and then the following Monday, you know, we went.

194
00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.000
I went into the careers office.

195
00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.000
Did your dad go with you?

196
00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:51.000
No, he didn't. But his office was only 400 meters from there.

197
00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:54.000
So I walked in and it was in old as shop.

198
00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:58.000
Obviously, parahevi, airborne, and I came out and went to my dad's office.

199
00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:02.000
I'm joining the parachute region. He says, you bloody knock.

200
00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.000
And March me straight back in.

201
00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:07.000
I didn't obviously he was raw engineers.

202
00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:16.000
I didn't know much about the raw engineers. I didn't know that you actually can do pee company and be an airborne engineer or do the all arms command of course and be a commander engineer.

203
00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:22.000
All I'd known was him playing football. So when he actually explained a bit more to me, I thought, okay, that's a good idea.

204
00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:29.000
Anyone you do go engineer, so you'd have some kind of a civilian skill set whether it was building or porn concrete or whatever.

205
00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:31.000
Yeah, skill you're going to get.

206
00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:36.000
Yeah, he was thinking, obviously, short term. I'll probably do minimum three years, you know, be a brick layer of plumber.

207
00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:40.000
So, but also within the military, there was a trades and b trades.

208
00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:46.000
You'll be trades in the engineers where your artist and trades, which is like carpenter plumber, you know, everyone else.

209
00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:53.000
And then your a trades was like your electricians and plant operators, sort of big JCBs and diggers.

210
00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:57.000
So my dad said, well, about a plant fair.

211
00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:13.000
So I was out garden and didn't know what he was on about. He said, no, he then explained. But again, before that, once he'd marched me back in the office a week later, to go in, do just touch screen test and basically a past it and said, you can choose any trade you want.

212
00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:20.000
Obviously back in 94, I was thinking more with my penis and I was thinking, bomb disposal, that sounds sexy.

213
00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:30.000
I said, let's go bomb disposal. So I went to my dad's office, I said, I'm going bomb disposal. Is it, you're not? He just marched me straight back in and then he said, right, why don't you be a plant fair?

214
00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:36.000
And again, you know, he was sort of carving my path or putting me in the right direction, you know, for step top.

215
00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:46.000
And that's it. So then you're enlisted. How long was that was the weight between when you enlisted and when you actually shipped after basic training?

216
00:24:46.000 --> 00:25:01.000
It wasn't longer told about two to three months. I went to a place called per bright. You have like a, it's almost like an acquaint in a free day's air. You do all your fitness tests and then you speak to other recruits, no, get their perception on, on basic training.

217
00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:08.000
So I was actually, I think my dad pulled a few few strains because I seem to get quite quick to just start point the numbers.

218
00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:18.000
And then in the book, you say, you basically say that basic training is what basic training is. Is there anything that shocked you about it? Did you feel like you were pretty ready for it?

219
00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:30.000
Um, okay, my father, you know, he's starting to steer anything. I had to turn up a place called Basinborn and all I'd known about Basinborn is where they filmed full metal jacket and Memphis belt.

220
00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:42.000
And as the only research I'd done on this place, but he had to be there from 0800 a morning to 1700 at night. You had to parade on the Sunday actually between those times.

221
00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:55.000
My father had me dropped off 075 with my hair already cut and my bag already packed because he knew it was all about first impressions. You know, if you start coming in, you know, just over five or about half four, you know,

222
00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:04.000
the instructors were already at March or cards. But I had to, I'd rather that fire to eight and I stood there from eight o'clock till five o'clock in the in the evening.

223
00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:11.000
So, you know, in reflection going back, I know why why he did it at the time was raining. I didn't appreciate it.

224
00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:20.000
But, you know, it's a culture shock training. Everything you're, you're sort of used to having your, your home come first. It's taken away from you. Guys, you did have hair.

225
00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:31.000
So, you've lost their hair and we all look the same. But it's good. You know, it still instills that discipline from the off. How long has British Army boot camp?

226
00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:42.000
So, it depends what what cat bad. So, the role engineers we do ten weeks basic training and and literally that just is as well. It says it's basic training.

227
00:26:42.000 --> 00:27:00.000
So, you then have phase two, combat engineer training, which is about 14 weeks and then you go on. If you then want to go do the command, of course, the command, of course, is ten weeks as well. So, if you start putting them all together, it can be quite long. If you join the role Marines, that's nine months from start to finish.

228
00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:06.000
So, yeah, it all depends on what cat bad you go into. But originally, basic training is about ten weeks.

229
00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:11.000
And then you got picked up to become, where did you get picked up to become a physical training instructor?

230
00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:12.000
Yeah, so I see.

231
00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:16.000
He's like they had a lot of faith in you out of the gate or was that your dad working behind the scenes?

232
00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:23.000
No, well, what it was when I finished my phase two training, I got my post in order.

233
00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:30.000
And I remember ringing my dad and my step mum, Penny, and I said, yeah, I've got posted to two-eight.

234
00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:36.000
And then she starts crying on the phone. And my dad's picking up the phone. He said, what if he said to Penny?

235
00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:41.04
I said I've been posted to two eight and I can hear him in the background and he said two eight not Q eight

236
00:27:41.28 --> 00:27:46.84
Like that, but what it was because of my father was the army manager two eight engineer regiments

237
00:27:46.84 --> 00:27:52.20
We're in Germany with the army champions football champions in Germany. So it was like your thoughts son

238
00:27:52.20 --> 00:27:58.46
So you're coming out to Germany. So I got posted to Hamill at the age of 18

239
00:27:59.12 --> 00:28:00.82
Which at the time was good you know

240
00:28:01.44 --> 00:28:03.76
It was the Deutsche Mark before the Euro

241
00:28:03.76 --> 00:28:08.72
It was like must cost about seven dollars for a crate of decks at 24 you know

242
00:28:08.72 --> 00:28:13.96
You know, I was I was seeing Germany which which is now collapsed. I mean everyone's back in UK

243
00:28:14.40 --> 00:28:15.36
But

244
00:28:15.36 --> 00:28:20.64
As soon as I arrived my son made a new the call is kiss borders the footballer's you're a kiss border

245
00:28:20.64 --> 00:28:23.96
You go's I'm not gonna see you because Litchie it was almost semi professional

246
00:28:23.96 --> 00:28:28.000
You didn't work you trained every morning between eight and 12 on the astro turf and

247
00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:33.52
You had a bit a big match every Wednesday afternoon and then we still pray play semi pro

248
00:28:34.36 --> 00:28:39.04
For local teams so he knew that he was never gonna have me as a soldier

249
00:28:39.20 --> 00:28:44.52
So he said well, I need to fill a slot a billet in the gym so you're going on your PT I course

250
00:28:44.52 --> 00:28:49.56
And that's how I manage to get it fast track so so quickly and then what that course consists of

251
00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:55.68
So I flew back to hold a shot and it was right next to one of my old schools and and it's basically

252
00:28:55.68 --> 00:29:00.56
They get into a position that you can you can teach physical training so when you go back to units

253
00:29:00.56 --> 00:29:02.72
There's different types of training you can do you can do gym

254
00:29:03.36 --> 00:29:08.88
PT you can do green PT the hardest thing is gymnastics. You actually have to do gymnastics and just like

255
00:29:09.44 --> 00:29:11.68
You know, it's like a flying track suit just float

256
00:29:12.24 --> 00:29:14.48
Frotisha and yeah, probably look more elegant than me

257
00:29:16.32 --> 00:29:22.76
It's just so you're in a position when you go back to the unit you can run PT sessions and then you end up from there

258
00:29:22.76 --> 00:29:27.52
You get done with that and then you now is when you check into 59 commando

259
00:29:27.92 --> 00:29:33.80
Yeah, there's a little period before between that so when I was in the gym I was like I could see

260
00:29:33.80 --> 00:29:39.28
I could see me almost mirroring my father's career and I was like I don't want it to be

261
00:29:40.16 --> 00:29:46.76
Tracks you soldier, you know, I want something different so you saw the possibility of mirroring your father's career and

262
00:29:46.76 --> 00:29:52.92
And something about it you didn't really you wanted to be you wanted to you wanted to get after it in a different way

263
00:29:52.92 --> 00:29:59.44
Yeah, that's it. I wanted to do some indifferent and so I actually feel like the application form for nine squadron and

264
00:29:59.72 --> 00:30:05.84
Five-nine and actually on reflection to nine squadron is the airborne engineers which is back in older shot where I grew up

265
00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:11.48
And five nine commando is down in north-devin and it's no surf heaven down there

266
00:30:11.48 --> 00:30:13.48
You know, I got sawn and beach, Croyd Beach

267
00:30:13.48 --> 00:30:18.76
So we are in San Diego and he's from Hawaii, so maybe it's not quite surf heaven

268
00:30:18.76 --> 00:30:26.68
Bro, yeah, you joined the military because you want to you want to see the world

269
00:30:26.68 --> 00:30:29.80
You want to experience new things. I didn't want to go back to older shots

270
00:30:29.80 --> 00:30:32.28
So five-nine commander was well suited for me

271
00:30:32.60 --> 00:30:39.52
So I applied for five nine commander and you have to go do a four week beat up with the unit before you can go on the all arms commander course

272
00:30:39.52 --> 00:30:42.64
So you go to the unit first and they kind of do an assessment

273
00:30:42.64 --> 00:30:47.84
That's it. Yeah, and then and then from there you go to who that sort of like Ranger's going America

274
00:30:47.84 --> 00:30:52.56
You can go to Ranger Battalion and you haven't been Ranger's career. Yeah, then you go to Ranger's go

275
00:30:52.56 --> 00:30:57.68
That's it. Yeah, it's like that but back in Germany joined this process when the paperwork was in

276
00:30:59.12 --> 00:31:04.72
One of the one of the squadrons had just returned from Northern Ireland and they had like a welcome back party in the camp

277
00:31:04.88 --> 00:31:06.08
camp bar

278
00:31:06.08 --> 00:31:08.24
There's a course called a

279
00:31:08.24 --> 00:31:13.76
Soul engineers were infantry can come do engineering courses and there was an infantry unit called the fuselage

280
00:31:14.24 --> 00:31:16.88
Who wrong camp doing that but they'd a

281
00:31:17.44 --> 00:31:21.44
Trouble makers basically they'll band from downtown and they'll always cause in trouble

282
00:31:21.44 --> 00:31:22.96
So they were on camp

283
00:31:22.96 --> 00:31:26.40
And this evening that they had the big the family get together

284
00:31:26.40 --> 00:31:31.20
They were in the bar as well and me and my friend could see they'll be quite rude to some of the

285
00:31:31.36 --> 00:31:34.16
We call him pads wives, you know the lads wives, you know

286
00:31:34.16 --> 00:31:40.000
And so me my friend you know decided to open up on a couple of them so we ended up you know

287
00:31:40.56 --> 00:31:45.76
Putting down free guys my my my my my sergeant Major came in is that right you boys go bed

288
00:31:45.76 --> 00:31:50.88
You know it's brushed under the carpet. I was then really a welcome by a military policeman to hours later

289
00:31:50.88 --> 00:31:52.88
Send you your under a rest and

290
00:31:54.48 --> 00:31:56.64
So before I went over to five nine command though

291
00:31:56.64 --> 00:31:57.44
I

292
00:31:57.44 --> 00:32:01.12
There was possibility that I could be getting called martial for this fight

293
00:32:01.12 --> 00:32:05.36
So I went over anyway. I did the first week the beat up

294
00:32:05.92 --> 00:32:10.16
And then the course staff said I didn't pause me and he said you you've got the flight to Germany

295
00:32:10.16 --> 00:32:11.68
They're doing an ID parade

296
00:32:11.68 --> 00:32:16.08
Okay, so I'd depred of some kind of investigation investigation with the police

297
00:32:16.08 --> 00:32:22.16
Yeah, they wanted to line you up with other other other guys and are you are you like totally destroyed at this point?

298
00:32:23.20 --> 00:32:28.64
I'm not totally destroyed. I you do worry about your career how this can it can affect your your career

299
00:32:28.64 --> 00:32:30.64
So I I flew over and

300
00:32:31.04 --> 00:32:33.52
Me at the time I still haven't grown into my ears

301
00:32:33.52 --> 00:32:38.56
So I just stood out like you know a sore thumb and they all knew me as the PTI so straight away

302
00:32:38.56 --> 00:32:42.72
They just be lined yeah, that's the guy my friend who did it with me however

303
00:32:42.72 --> 00:32:47.68
He's he is brother was in the squargin as well. So he never got picked out so that okay great

304
00:32:48.64 --> 00:32:50.64
So I flew back to

305
00:32:50.80 --> 00:32:53.84
Finish the beat up you know to say yet you're fit enough. You ready?

306
00:32:53.84 --> 00:32:56.80
So I went on and did the did the command of course and

307
00:32:56.80 --> 00:33:02.08
And when we finished the command of course 10 weeks later we go back to five nine commando and

308
00:33:02.80 --> 00:33:03.80
the

309
00:33:03.80 --> 00:33:09.36
O.C. Is like that. He said right guys you guys are going across the water and the squargin were in Northern Ireland

310
00:33:09.36 --> 00:33:13.20
So forth perfect rough to Northern Ireland said not you stop. You're going across the other water

311
00:33:13.20 --> 00:33:16.64
You're going back to Germany so we need to get this get this cleared

312
00:33:17.36 --> 00:33:19.36
So I went back to Germany and

313
00:33:20.40 --> 00:33:23.84
Basically they said look you can go caught much or maybe we'll get thrown out

314
00:33:23.84 --> 00:33:28.24
But that's gonna be another 12 months to 18 months. You know, I've just passed the command of course

315
00:33:28.24 --> 00:33:30.24
I wanted to go be with the commandos

316
00:33:30.72 --> 00:33:32.72
So I just bleed a guilty

317
00:33:32.72 --> 00:33:36.96
I got charged and so I spent 56 days in the military correction

318
00:33:37.12 --> 00:33:40.16
Train and sent it which is cold yesterday prison known as the glass house

319
00:33:41.28 --> 00:33:44.48
And but the the command and officer actually because everyone knew

320
00:33:45.20 --> 00:33:49.36
It was me and the other guy, you know, then and they knew these guys are trouble makers

321
00:33:49.36 --> 00:33:55.92
They're like yeah, you just unfortunately you got caught out so the command in officer was an airborne guy at airborne engineers

322
00:33:55.92 --> 00:33:59.76
This is the commanding officer at court-chester no no this is this is a German yeah

323
00:33:59.76 --> 00:34:03.52
No, this isn't Germany. Okay, but you know, so I have to leave that unit first and

324
00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:08.80
So the RSM march is me and the RSM was one of a football player with me and

325
00:34:10.24 --> 00:34:12.48
And he's like outright no sapper start

326
00:34:13.04 --> 00:34:14.72
I was gonna give you 60 days

327
00:34:14.72 --> 00:34:18.16
But because you've done the all-arms commander course. I've taken four days off

328
00:34:18.16 --> 00:34:22.48
Any questions? I said yes if I've gone airborne what I got more days

329
00:34:23.44 --> 00:34:27.04
You saw a gig all done he said like you know, it's time for you to go so

330
00:34:27.68 --> 00:34:31.04
So yeah, I spent 56 days in her matrices

331
00:34:31.76 --> 00:34:38.24
Creative trainers center. Yeah, I was looking I didn't know what cold gesture was but it's basically with it's the same term echo Charles

332
00:34:38.24 --> 00:34:40.72
Would you hear somebody say 11 worth what do you think of?

333
00:34:41.52 --> 00:34:46.32
Yeah, military prison. Yeah, that's kind of a way cold trip. I think it's the last military prison

334
00:34:46.32 --> 00:34:52.96
Really in England or something. Yeah, it's everybody knows that the glass house. It's the glass house. It's the equivalent of 11 worth yeah

335
00:34:52.96 --> 00:34:58.56
And and everyone has you know here horror stories coming out the glass house and what and what it actually is is

336
00:34:59.12 --> 00:35:05.12
Because when you have an escort that drops you off and they instruct is there to meet you and it's like it is like a

337
00:35:05.12 --> 00:35:10.40
Scenal full metal jacket. They are screaming and shouting out you but as soon as they've gone they're just treat you like adults

338
00:35:10.80 --> 00:35:13.52
You know, I mean it's they take away all those sort of

339
00:35:13.52 --> 00:35:18.40
There's creature comforts, you know, you don't you're not allowed to phone anyone it's

340
00:35:19.28 --> 00:35:24.72
Two PT sessions a day. It's room inspections all the time. I actually really enjoyed cold chest

341
00:35:25.84 --> 00:35:32.80
I said if I if I got paid full full wages I would have I would have really enjoyed it and it got to a stage actually where guys

342
00:35:32.80 --> 00:35:35.20
We're going into cold chest that and coming out

343
00:35:36.08 --> 00:35:41.68
Better soldiers a lot better soldiers and they were actually getting promoted when they got back to their units and they had to stop that

344
00:35:41.68 --> 00:35:43.68
I said no it's

345
00:35:44.16 --> 00:35:48.80
You know you're there for a long you know the bad bad reasons you can't be seen to be be promoted

346
00:35:48.80 --> 00:35:51.60
So I did I did my time there and

347
00:35:52.40 --> 00:35:54.40
Went back to five nine

348
00:35:54.40 --> 00:35:58.24
Right rewind a little bit to the command of course. Yes. How was that?

349
00:35:59.20 --> 00:36:02.64
Yeah, so I remember my father dropping me off at

350
00:36:03.04 --> 00:36:06.08
Drive and meet an off Devon to do the beat up and then you know

351
00:36:06.08 --> 00:36:10.48
I've obviously hadn't told him about the incident in Germany at this point and he said you know these guys

352
00:36:10.48 --> 00:36:16.24
Well, you know these guys will or make your man you know I mean so you obviously really nervous about things that but

353
00:36:16.80 --> 00:36:20.08
But it is that the beat ups great you know the five nine beat up

354
00:36:20.16 --> 00:36:23.12
They actually is harder than your alarms command of course

355
00:36:23.20 --> 00:36:30.08
So if you can reach their levels of their expectations then as long as you stay away from injury when you've gone your alarms command of course

356
00:36:30.08 --> 00:36:32.08
You should be fine

357
00:36:32.08 --> 00:36:37.28
So the all arms command of course is for any cat badges so engine is artillery

358
00:36:37.28 --> 00:36:42.56
Anyone who's going to be serving alongside free command of brigade with the raw Marines or any naval

359
00:36:43.68 --> 00:36:50.08
No doctors dentists as well so you've got a mixed run on that course and you've got guys who are

360
00:36:51.20 --> 00:36:56.08
Young privates all the way through to quite senior officers who may have just been attached to the brigade

361
00:36:56.96 --> 00:36:58.96
And we also have foreign

362
00:36:59.20 --> 00:37:03.92
Foreign military there remember we had a a seal no a marine on our course as well

363
00:37:03.92 --> 00:37:08.16
US Marine on our course we had some guys from Lebanon we had some guys from Russia

364
00:37:08.72 --> 00:37:14.96
All sorts on there and basically they get you to a standard so you're understanding the raw Marines

365
00:37:15.36 --> 00:37:16.40
Sort of

366
00:37:16.40 --> 00:37:21.60
TTPs their SOPs and so when you go to unit you understand that how they operate as well

367
00:37:21.60 --> 00:37:26.48
You know you do amphibious warfare as well. I mean you also do their command of tests

368
00:37:27.04 --> 00:37:32.48
So their command of tests in the 30 mile or which is the last one to get you your green beret in all the

369
00:37:32.48 --> 00:37:39.52
All the other tests that that build up to it and it's ten weeks long and I could be a doctor

370
00:37:39.92 --> 00:37:45.04
That's gonna get attached to I could be a 39 year old doctor that's gonna be attached to commando

371
00:37:45.04 --> 00:37:48.24
And I got to go through that get a 30 pound rock on it

372
00:37:48.40 --> 00:37:53.60
I think for them they they have they were they volunteer for it. You know that they can still serve with a brigade

373
00:37:53.60 --> 00:37:54.96
But it's almost like

374
00:37:54.96 --> 00:37:59.28
You know and you they see that you made the effort and you've got the coveted green beret

375
00:37:59.68 --> 00:38:00.48
You know

376
00:38:00.48 --> 00:38:03.84
Probably they get less pressure if they've done the course

377
00:38:03.84 --> 00:38:08.48
But actually saying that the Navy guys were really good because a few years later

378
00:38:08.48 --> 00:38:11.60
Which were touch and I ended up being in instructor on the on this command of course

379
00:38:11.60 --> 00:38:15.52
So the Navy guys because they have no military background before this

380
00:38:15.84 --> 00:38:20.08
They've not picked up any bad habits and so what the instructors were telling them they were doing an

381
00:38:20.08 --> 00:38:22.08
Upstrate away where as you may have a

382
00:38:22.16 --> 00:38:27.60
Assage and or a staff sergeant who's you know been in 14 years and he's already picked up

383
00:38:27.60 --> 00:38:30.000
He's a little bad habits and it's happened to you know

384
00:38:30.72 --> 00:38:33.52
Realigning or reset that home all her cock

385
00:38:34.32 --> 00:38:36.32
But for us our course

386
00:38:36.32 --> 00:38:39.60
I didn't learn anything if I'm on I learned nothing on our course

387
00:38:40.72 --> 00:38:43.44
Every one of our instructors got sacked at the end of the course

388
00:38:43.44 --> 00:38:45.92
Our course was very officer heavy and

389
00:38:46.56 --> 00:38:50.08
It was like we weren't allowed to wear gortex if it rained

390
00:38:50.08 --> 00:38:54.96
We didn't learn anything it was so out hooks survive in the cold and who was the fierce

391
00:38:54.96 --> 00:38:59.28
Actually learning anything soldier wise. I picked up when I got to the unit

392
00:38:59.44 --> 00:39:04.000
But that backfired on instructors because at the end of the course they do like course critiques

393
00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:09.12
You know how was your course and could it was so officer heavy that they went to town on

394
00:39:09.12 --> 00:39:14.72
Oh, they went to town on because then this and guys get handed a critique and they're like good good

395
00:39:14.72 --> 00:39:16.72
Yeah, I'm going to get a beer

396
00:39:16.72 --> 00:39:19.84
Offs just like let me stay my opinion on this matter. Oh

397
00:39:19.84 --> 00:39:27.52
Yeah, it about fired every every instructor got sacked apart from the two army guys the engine here and the artillery officer

398
00:39:27.84 --> 00:39:29.84
But for me. I'm still I'm only 18

399
00:39:30.96 --> 00:39:34.32
You know you're still developing as a as a young man. I wasn't

400
00:39:35.36 --> 00:39:40.80
Wasn't fully grown. I remember the load carries been you know really difficult you're carrying some excess weight

401
00:39:41.68 --> 00:39:45.36
And it's very different from like p company the Paris us us all more

402
00:39:45.36 --> 00:39:51.68
That they're leaner and then they go faster with with less weight with the command those it's tend to be bigger guys

403
00:39:52.80 --> 00:39:55.60
Carrying more weight bonus slow speed so yeah

404
00:39:56.32 --> 00:40:00.64
I do think that's probably one of the hardest courses still today, but that's because I hadn't developed

405
00:40:01.20 --> 00:40:02.72
Yeah, fully

406
00:40:02.72 --> 00:40:06.32
Now I got to pull this one section out of the book because I thought it was worth

407
00:40:06.80 --> 00:40:10.64
Reading this is when you're in coldchester and you have this conversation

408
00:40:10.64 --> 00:40:14.40
Um, you say drink was a big problem in the forces at the time

409
00:40:14.96 --> 00:40:20.16
I'd be surprised if it isn't still and so when I was interviewed by the officer of the prison

410
00:40:20.40 --> 00:40:22.40
I was thrilled about my alcohol consumption

411
00:40:24.64 --> 00:40:28.000
You were drunk when you hit the other soldiers correct yes sir

412
00:40:28.40 --> 00:40:31.52
So do you have a drinking problem no sir? I'd have hit them anyways

413
00:40:32.24 --> 00:40:38.000
Hmm what happened to your wrist and this is another thing you explain I fell out of a window sir trying to urinate sir

414
00:40:38.40 --> 00:40:39.68
were you drunk?

415
00:40:39.68 --> 00:40:41.68
Well, yes sir

416
00:40:42.08 --> 00:40:43.84
Hmm, so you don't have a drinking problem

417
00:40:44.96 --> 00:40:51.44
I didn't really know how to reply to that one as far as I saw it was just part of army life part of being a squatty

418
00:40:52.40 --> 00:40:55.12
If I had a drinking problem, maybe the whole army did personally

419
00:40:55.12 --> 00:41:01.52
I felt like it was just being one of the boys the officer dismissed me and then you go on to the fact that you enjoyed being a coldchester

420
00:41:01.76 --> 00:41:03.04
Which is

421
00:41:03.04 --> 00:41:05.76
Which is cool you had a good time, but that's a

422
00:41:05.76 --> 00:41:12.000
That's one of those things as I was reading it. I've I had quite a few conversations with young seals

423
00:41:13.04 --> 00:41:14.48
You know hey, so

424
00:41:14.88 --> 00:41:17.84
You've gotten another fight to borrow right and that's why you're in here talking to me

425
00:41:18.56 --> 00:41:23.04
Yeah, what are you drinking yeah, and you also were here three months ago

426
00:41:23.92 --> 00:41:28.88
And you were also in another fight in a bar and you were drinking you see any common things here no

427
00:41:28.88 --> 00:41:36.48
Yeah, any commonalities between these incidents no I don't know I like to fight I guess

428
00:41:38.64 --> 00:41:40.64
I got to watch out for that one

429
00:41:42.32 --> 00:41:44.32
You get to

430
00:41:44.32 --> 00:41:49.36
You get to to to to 50 you call it five nine or 59 five nine yeah you get to five nine and and

431
00:41:51.04 --> 00:41:56.64
I thought this was cool couldn't have asked for a better beginning to my time at five nine the admin officer took one look at my report from coldchester

432
00:41:56.64 --> 00:42:00.72
seemed happy with what he saw and whipped it up fresh start

433
00:42:01.76 --> 00:42:04.56
But it was a lonely start the rest of the squadron was in northern island

434
00:42:04.96 --> 00:42:08.48
finishing the tour I had missed out on doing to my two-night time and cally

435
00:42:09.04 --> 00:42:11.84
I was gutted not to be a part of that but an end up working my favor

436
00:42:12.40 --> 00:42:14.64
We're sending you on a diving aptitude course

437
00:42:16.64 --> 00:42:20.000
Usually guys have to wait years to get on this so consider yourself lucky

438
00:42:20.48 --> 00:42:24.000
So because the other guys were deployed northern island you got an opportunity to go to this dive course

439
00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:30.88
Yeah, that's it so in the role engineers we we have divers so everything you can do on the surface bit

440
00:42:32.48 --> 00:42:34.48
Broco cut in

441
00:42:34.48 --> 00:42:35.52
Welding

442
00:42:35.52 --> 00:42:41.12
Carvendry scaffold in everything we we can do sub-surface you guys call that hard hat diving

443
00:42:42.16 --> 00:42:44.80
The OSDS which is the open supply

444
00:42:45.04 --> 00:42:52.32
Diversist and the Kirby Morgan helmets that that's part of it so scuba's part of it and and so is and so is that but we group everything

445
00:42:52.32 --> 00:42:56.88
If you're not doing combat swimmer operations like if you're just if you're doing any kind of work

446
00:42:56.88 --> 00:43:00.48
We call it hard-ha diving like it's a hard-ha dive and it's like good good for you

447
00:43:00.48 --> 00:43:04.64
Yeah, but like yeah, that's the way we classify anything that's not draggar

448
00:43:05.44 --> 00:43:08.24
Combat swimmer ship attack you know it's like hard-ha diving

449
00:43:08.24 --> 00:43:10.24
Yeah before you dive into that

450
00:43:10.64 --> 00:43:12.96
So this this going to cold-chester

451
00:43:13.68 --> 00:43:17.20
That's is that on your record or when that guy shredded it was it gone?

452
00:43:17.76 --> 00:43:20.96
I think it stays on my record. I think you're just trying to prove point is you know

453
00:43:20.96 --> 00:43:25.92
We draw the line fresh start but actually a lot of a lot of guys do well in the military

454
00:43:25.92 --> 00:43:29.44
lot of these RSMs you look back especially the guards they've been a cold-chester

455
00:43:29.44 --> 00:43:34.64
It's almost you touch something in it then and that you'd breathe up a guy if a drink and then three months later

456
00:43:34.64 --> 00:43:37.68
He coming in tell him again and well, obviously he's he's making a mistake

457
00:43:38.08 --> 00:43:43.12
I learned from my mistake and I learned at an early stage thankfully it didn't happen later on in my career

458
00:43:43.76 --> 00:43:45.28
And then obviously have

459
00:43:45.28 --> 00:43:51.84
Bigger consequences could I still didn't have rank at that point yeah, you know, yeah, no, it's I so in the in the navy

460
00:43:52.40 --> 00:43:59.52
You have service stripes on your uniform and if you've never been in trouble those service stripes are gold

461
00:43:59.52 --> 00:44:06.48
So in your dress uniform, you see a navy guy a navy master chief for a senior chief and they're in their uniform

462
00:44:06.56 --> 00:44:10.000
They'll have service stripes so it's like one stripe for every four years

463
00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:16.000
You can so you can have a lot of stripes after 28 years yeah, and if you've never been in trouble they're gold

464
00:44:16.96 --> 00:44:21.20
But if you've been in trouble if you have like a captain's master something like that they're red and

465
00:44:22.16 --> 00:44:26.88
It was it it was always interesting to see that there would be guys that would be master chiefs and they'd have that they'd have red stripes

466
00:44:26.88 --> 00:44:33.20
I mean they got in trouble at some point in their career and the reason I asked that is because you know it's up as

467
00:44:34.08 --> 00:44:36.08
more and more

468
00:44:36.08 --> 00:44:38.08
focus sort of

469
00:44:38.08 --> 00:44:40.08
More more attention to the seal teams

470
00:44:40.32 --> 00:44:45.60
You know, it was like a lot less of a there's there's more of a zero defect mentality

471
00:44:45.60 --> 00:44:49.28
And if you got in trouble one time, it was gonna stay with you. There's gonna be a problem

472
00:44:49.84 --> 00:44:53.52
So those gold versus red stripes was it kind of like

473
00:44:54.16 --> 00:45:00.08
It's kind of cool to have the red one or is it kind of put out the gold or what is it depends on your assessment of the situation

474
00:45:00.08 --> 00:45:05.76
That's what I mean like what was the common like the culture like if you see in a guy and one guy had a gold one guy

475
00:45:05.76 --> 00:45:12.000
A huge deal not a huge deal, but like BTF Tony yeah red all day

476
00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:17.76
It's one of my buddies needs like you know just a a break glass in case of war type of dude and

477
00:45:18.08 --> 00:45:23.60
Yeah, he had red so it kind of depends on the person's like personality like it's a case by case

478
00:45:23.60 --> 00:45:26.88
Yes, this is you know back in the day when guy

479
00:45:27.44 --> 00:45:31.60
Yeah, you know when guys were getting in trouble more because there's also less going on and

480
00:45:31.60 --> 00:45:36.24
Really a lot of a bull is down to leadership too, you know if you're if your

481
00:45:37.68 --> 00:45:41.20
Leadership isn't given you stuff to do and pointing you in the right direction

482
00:45:41.52 --> 00:45:48.64
Where do you end up if you're 18 years old if you're 21 years old if you're 19 years old and you don't you're not given good direction

483
00:45:48.64 --> 00:45:52.000
Where do you end up as a as a young male where do you end up echo Charles?

484
00:45:53.44 --> 00:45:59.68
Jale well possibly but definitely in a pub definitely you know being aggressive definitely doing these that's what you're gonna do

485
00:45:59.68 --> 00:46:02.48
So and so if you haven't gotten some good guidance

486
00:46:03.20 --> 00:46:08.000
Then it's gonna be problematic and you know we're getting better at it, but it definitely is

487
00:46:08.80 --> 00:46:10.80
It's good to hear that

488
00:46:10.80 --> 00:46:17.44
You could you could have a a mistake like that and look you could be how many times did you not get caught right of course

489
00:46:17.44 --> 00:46:22.24
Yeah, plenty of times this time you got caught it's good that you could get caught learn a lesson

490
00:46:22.88 --> 00:46:27.84
And move on. It's also very interesting that people would come out of that highly disimplent environment

491
00:46:27.84 --> 00:46:31.68
Highly disciplined environment in coldchester and do better as humans yeah

492
00:46:32.08 --> 00:46:36.24
Do better as soldiers that's freaking legit that's proof

493
00:46:37.04 --> 00:46:39.04
Proof the discipline equals freedom

494
00:46:39.92 --> 00:46:43.68
Well, that that's kind of a good deal where like yeah, you can go to prison

495
00:46:44.08 --> 00:46:48.80
Essentially and get what I mean would you call it rehabilitated like if you're improved?

496
00:46:49.36 --> 00:46:52.80
Yeah, a lot of it. I mean isn't shouldn't that sort of be the goal?

497
00:46:53.36 --> 00:46:56.000
Yeah, yeah, I think so you know I said it's

498
00:46:56.000 --> 00:47:00.08
You know we have some in similar we don't have the the bands on our arms

499
00:47:00.08 --> 00:47:05.04
But if you have 15 years of of good discipline you get the long service good conduct metal

500
00:47:05.60 --> 00:47:09.20
Yeah, you have things you know to aspire to but you know

501
00:47:09.44 --> 00:47:14.48
I think everyone will get in trouble as that as long as you learn from it it's character building as well

502
00:47:14.48 --> 00:47:19.44
And thankfully for me it was at an early age. My good friend now he's he's the RSM and the SES

503
00:47:19.44 --> 00:47:21.20
He was in coldchester prison with me as well

504
00:47:21.20 --> 00:47:28.48
So but that's where it's the height it's been almost like oh people are getting promoted and it's the wrong reasons for be going there

505
00:47:29.36 --> 00:47:32.48
But as you if you come out a different man different soldier

506
00:47:32.48 --> 00:47:35.52
But like I said the instructions in there were amazing and that's probably you know

507
00:47:35.84 --> 00:47:38.48
That was reflective on the guys when it came out well

508
00:47:38.48 --> 00:47:44.40
It's interesting that you actually call them instructors and not guards right when you go into the navy brick

509
00:47:44.88 --> 00:47:48.56
If you're in the Marine Corps in the Navy you get in trouble you go into the brig and those are guards

510
00:47:48.56 --> 00:47:52.08
They're not instructors so it's kind of cool that they were actually trying to who well

511
00:47:52.08 --> 00:47:54.96
Do you think that they were trying to teach you they were trying to well you for it?

512
00:47:54.96 --> 00:47:57.92
Yeah, well you you have military lessons it is just being on camp

513
00:47:57.92 --> 00:48:00.24
But you would just lock-up at night. That's the only difference

514
00:48:00.56 --> 00:48:04.48
You know you are going to you're doing drill you know the guards we're like today

515
00:48:04.48 --> 00:48:07.84
We're gonna take off on the runway and there's just be much in this fast as you can

516
00:48:07.84 --> 00:48:10.32
I mean you have the gym instructors and then you do

517
00:48:10.32 --> 00:48:17.92
Aircraft recognition you'd be on the ranges you go from runs PT you would run out of the camp gates and I remember running like I think

518
00:48:18.48 --> 00:48:23.12
But I knew that if someone wanted to take it a bulk for it and you stopped them it reduced your sentence

519
00:48:23.12 --> 00:48:25.44
I was I was keeping an eye out you know for any sort of

520
00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:33.12
Really, you tackled somebody yeah, yeah, yeah, but I think you you have an interview when you go in and they they sort of say

521
00:48:33.12 --> 00:48:37.28
You know you got all sorts in there you got guys who don't want to be in a military

522
00:48:37.28 --> 00:48:41.60
You know, I've got A what you got guys with drugs you got you know, you know, there's all things and when now

523
00:48:41.60 --> 00:48:45.52
You know you just don't it said you know I've gotten to fight and they're like you just got caught

524
00:48:45.52 --> 00:48:50.08
Mm-hmm. That's it. Yeah, that they they and this they've probably been in the position you've been in before

525
00:48:50.08 --> 00:48:51.36
But just didn't get caught

526
00:48:51.36 --> 00:48:58.32
So so it's like more I mean it's like the a different approach essentially then like a you know like when you think of prison

527
00:48:58.64 --> 00:49:04.56
Outside of the military you're like now that's your punishment straight up like you you're it's essentially like the

528
00:49:04.56 --> 00:49:10.96
The difference between a beating and a counseling kind of thing yeah, so like you know what you're talking about it's kind of a counseling like hey

529
00:49:10.96 --> 00:49:13.36
He did this let's let's let's kind of

530
00:49:14.32 --> 00:49:19.52
Re-benefits from this whole situation you improve you well they have programs like this now that I think about it

531
00:49:19.52 --> 00:49:22.24
They have programs like this in America. I don't know if they have an England

532
00:49:22.24 --> 00:49:26.56
But they take kids that are on the wrong track and they put them into like a highly disciplined

533
00:49:27.76 --> 00:49:31.44
Military militaristic environment and it definitely can straighten them out. I

534
00:49:31.44 --> 00:49:39.04
I sponsored a kid going if you want to those things and went up there and saw what they were doing and it's like a lot of those kids really turn around and start doing well

535
00:49:39.28 --> 00:49:41.28
Yeah, so yeah, and then

536
00:49:41.52 --> 00:49:46.64
But then if you just get the beating it's like you just it's a yeah, it's just a different approach, right?

537
00:49:46.64 --> 00:49:50.80
It's more effective. I think for the military you know if you come out a different person

538
00:49:50.80 --> 00:49:54.56
You know if you become out and then you re-affended and obviously that there's a problem

539
00:49:55.36 --> 00:49:57.76
But I think it's almost like yes, it's one strike

540
00:49:57.76 --> 00:50:02.72
Yeah, because you you can go in and you have 28 days and under and 28 days and older

541
00:50:02.72 --> 00:50:04.56
It's like two different wings and sort of look down

542
00:50:05.28 --> 00:50:11.12
Down at the 28 days and that book you're like I'm competitive about it. You guys are over here for 28 days. I'm big type

543
00:50:12.08 --> 00:50:15.52
I mean you got the ones actually we're gonna get discharged from the military as well

544
00:50:15.52 --> 00:50:18.16
But rather than just thrown them out they gave it they would go do

545
00:50:18.80 --> 00:50:22.24
Plumbing courses carbon to courses so those stuff that that's a help them

546
00:50:22.80 --> 00:50:26.08
That's a square the way okay, so I cut you off when you're starting to talk about dive

547
00:50:26.08 --> 00:50:31.52
Squire. I'm sorry, but yeah, no, it's yeah, so um, but for the raw engineers have divers

548
00:50:31.52 --> 00:50:33.52
And we have about 450

549
00:50:33.92 --> 00:50:35.92
divers at the moment and and basically

550
00:50:36.56 --> 00:50:38.72
What um when I was in Germany

551
00:50:38.72 --> 00:50:43.20
There was always things on orders asking for guys who want to go on a dive course because everyone's heard of P company

552
00:50:43.44 --> 00:50:46.000
The paracourse and the all arms command of course, but the dive course

553
00:50:46.56 --> 00:50:50.32
I think it's probably one of the most the ideas and underrated and underrated courses

554
00:50:50.32 --> 00:50:56.32
There's also an additional quals you get you get more money back back in a day when I did it was only £2.65

555
00:50:56.32 --> 00:50:57.60
About five dollars a day

556
00:50:58.16 --> 00:51:02.16
But now you're talking you know 20 pounds so 35 40 dollars

557
00:51:02.80 --> 00:51:05.84
So they used to always be anyone want to go out of class

558
00:51:06.64 --> 00:51:07.84
Exactly

559
00:51:07.84 --> 00:51:11.68
But there was there's struggle to get volunteers from other units

560
00:51:12.16 --> 00:51:14.80
Because of the guys some airborne engineers and

561
00:51:14.80 --> 00:51:21.28
Commander engineers could they're so already physically robust that there's a weight in this you know you are the back of that list

562
00:51:22.72 --> 00:51:24.24
But because they're all in Germany

563
00:51:24.24 --> 00:51:28.56
So all in Northern Ireland they're allowed or you're going on the absolute so I literally must

564
00:51:28.56 --> 00:51:32.24
They're just fast tracked two or three years to get on it on this course

565
00:51:32.72 --> 00:51:34.72
So I went and did my absolute and

566
00:51:35.52 --> 00:51:41.52
Now I've seen dive in change over the years and this was back in 1997 and

567
00:51:41.52 --> 00:51:47.44
And it was it was called a desk at dive and set self-contained compressed there's like scuba

568
00:51:48.08 --> 00:51:52.16
But it was no comms we don't have any comms it was nil visibility

569
00:51:52.72 --> 00:51:59.12
The only way we communicate we had a lifeline a rope around our chest with a bow line and it just do pools and bells

570
00:51:59.52 --> 00:52:03.36
So is an alien as you know under water's an alien environment

571
00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:06.000
So a lot of guys don't like it but for me

572
00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:11.36
Been surfing and I love the war it was almost like for me I'm more comfortable underwater

573
00:52:11.92 --> 00:52:18.88
And I am on land so so I did that course came back and the squadron had just returned from the Northern Ireland

574
00:52:18.88 --> 00:52:20.88
So here's me now and it's new unit

575
00:52:21.36 --> 00:52:27.36
Just stolen everyone's dive course which everyone's on the weight list score and they've obviously heard I've just come out of cold chest

576
00:52:27.36 --> 00:52:31.04
The prison so there's a couple there was a couple of names within the unit like

577
00:52:31.04 --> 00:52:35.12
You know squadron bullies and a lot of all wait till such and such

578
00:52:35.60 --> 00:52:40.24
Season I thought here we go we had a Christmas pie and one of the lads just comes over

579
00:52:40.24 --> 00:52:44.56
Sit all you think your hand in just just full on straight in the face

580
00:52:45.84 --> 00:52:50.08
So I you know I just I just right hooked him back and you know he's that back

581
00:52:50.08 --> 00:52:53.68
So I saw all I needed to know and I think that's sort of

582
00:52:54.24 --> 00:52:57.28
No give my my foot in the door within the unit but

583
00:52:57.28 --> 00:53:04.16
What five nine commando used to be the army minor unit box in champions and each year

584
00:53:04.16 --> 00:53:08.80
They were because they won the final they'd automatically go to the final the next year

585
00:53:09.36 --> 00:53:12.000
And each year our opponents were the airborne engineers

586
00:53:12.48 --> 00:53:16.88
So this was coming up in January free mums train it. I didn't have a choice to that well

587
00:53:17.20 --> 00:53:19.76
You've been a court yesterday, surprisingly run the boxing team. What's up really?

588
00:53:20.48 --> 00:53:24.48
So um, so we went I just spent three mums. Did you ever box before?

589
00:53:24.48 --> 00:53:27.68
I did in in gulfid where near Surrey

590
00:53:28.08 --> 00:53:30.64
One of my friends from school we went to a place called Bellefields

591
00:53:30.64 --> 00:53:32.88
So I did a bit of boxing in there and again my father

592
00:53:33.52 --> 00:53:36.80
Didn't want me boxing and I saw her in agreement and I was like well look I'll

593
00:53:37.12 --> 00:53:42.000
Box until I get beat and then you know then I'll stop so thankfully I never I never got beat

594
00:53:42.16 --> 00:53:44.88
I only had to about three fights. I think when I was at one as there

595
00:53:45.52 --> 00:53:49.36
But in the military in five nine commando. It's it's just pure fitness

596
00:53:49.36 --> 00:53:56.80
There's no boxing skill at all and we always have three or four PT sessions a day and rather than like

597
00:53:57.76 --> 00:54:02.56
Lose the weight over period of time. They lose the weight in a short period. I mean you got a maintain it

598
00:54:03.28 --> 00:54:09.12
But three mums later we had the army mine units finals and there's other guys from the squadron

599
00:54:09.52 --> 00:54:12.56
Based at other training units and there's you can see in reading the book like

600
00:54:13.12 --> 00:54:15.12
Who's this start who's this new lad and

601
00:54:15.12 --> 00:54:21.76
And we thought we were gonna walk away with it and at the interval it was too all the seven fights at a night

602
00:54:21.76 --> 00:54:26.48
It's too all at the interval and the member decided to major coming in and he's just like my chest

603
00:54:26.48 --> 00:54:28.48
You need to you know

604
00:54:28.48 --> 00:54:31.52
Poca me right in the middle of chess and I was like oh my god and

605
00:54:32.16 --> 00:54:36.32
I came out and I I tears him I was the dreading was pumping

606
00:54:36.56 --> 00:54:38.24
But went out and I knocked the guy down

607
00:54:38.80 --> 00:54:42.64
Three times in a minute and 20 seconds and and that literally you know

608
00:54:42.64 --> 00:54:47.04
I'd made my mark within five nine command of an asset would in quite well

609
00:54:47.68 --> 00:54:49.68
That's awesome good story

610
00:54:50.96 --> 00:54:56.64
You go you go here in the book you say it wasn't it wasn't long to my time at five nine that I was selected for

611
00:54:56.64 --> 00:54:59.60
Recky troop a kind of elite within the squadron

612
00:54:59.60 --> 00:55:06.88
It was a huge privilege as Recky was known as being a great stepping stone towards the special forces and idea that I'd be

613
00:55:06.88 --> 00:55:08.64
gun to toy with

614
00:55:08.64 --> 00:55:10.64
Thinking about my future in the army

615
00:55:10.64 --> 00:55:17.84
So you end up in Recky troop as a year so in free commander rigidia five nine commando

616
00:55:18.72 --> 00:55:22.16
Engineers at support the brigade you have two nine commando the artillery and

617
00:55:22.72 --> 00:55:26.16
Within free commander rigid they have their own sort of

618
00:55:27.44 --> 00:55:28.40
reconnaissance

619
00:55:28.40 --> 00:55:29.44
troop called

620
00:55:29.44 --> 00:55:31.60
Brigade Recky force or brigade prepared

621
00:55:32.32 --> 00:55:33.92
Brigade for troll troop

622
00:55:33.92 --> 00:55:39.44
From the Marines which consists of snipers and amount in leaders but also part of that group is

623
00:55:39.44 --> 00:55:44.08
Naval gunfire from the artillery and also five nine wrecky troop

624
00:55:44.08 --> 00:55:47.52
So we're almost like eyes on the ground advance size on the ground

625
00:55:47.52 --> 00:55:50.48
You know given input on potential combat engineering tasks

626
00:55:51.12 --> 00:55:56.72
So you have to be selected from Recky troop within five nine commando and they did that in Norway

627
00:55:56.72 --> 00:56:01.68
So each year we used to go to Norway for free months and the whole of the brigade and we do

628
00:56:01.68 --> 00:56:07.36
Hearty warfare training it was all due to the cold war and if the Russians was starting to head west across

629
00:56:07.36 --> 00:56:13.28
Norway that we'd be able to you know to stop it so you know and Norway's an equaliser

630
00:56:13.28 --> 00:56:19.44
And that that separates the boys from the men so I'd got my name would be no picked up to go Recky troop and

631
00:56:21.04 --> 00:56:23.68
So yeah, so very fortunate to get selected again

632
00:56:24.80 --> 00:56:27.52
a young age to go Recky troop and

633
00:56:28.80 --> 00:56:36.16
Within five nine commando is actually classed as a post in so my time it started again as I as I entered in into Recky troop

634
00:56:36.16 --> 00:56:42.16
As you touched on there a Recky troop at a hundred percent pass rate for UK special forces selection

635
00:56:42.40 --> 00:56:46.16
So guys I would see guys leaving and never come back

636
00:56:46.72 --> 00:56:52.48
So for me this when I then started my head started turning towards your patunius special forces

637
00:56:52.48 --> 00:56:56.72
You know my dad told me last two minutes I managed to get through base at training

638
00:56:56.72 --> 00:57:00.32
I've done a peach out a manager get through coldchester a manager get through the commander course

639
00:57:00.32 --> 00:57:09.76
I'm now just about getting my my paroings and you're also then amongst like minded individuals those who want to go or aspire to be special forces

640
00:57:09.76 --> 00:57:14.08
So yeah, that was Recky troop for me. Did you did you go through any

641
00:57:14.40 --> 00:57:19.44
Official training for Recky troop? Do you have to go to a school or is it just from the units yourself you could train up?

642
00:57:19.44 --> 00:57:24.80
They they had their own selection process with it within the unit and then you used to have to go do pee company

643
00:57:24.80 --> 00:57:27.04
So the the airborne engineers

644
00:57:27.04 --> 00:57:30.80
Of course, but when I when I got there our troops staff sergeant you know

645
00:57:30.96 --> 00:57:33.20
Said there's no need to do pee company, you know

646
00:57:33.36 --> 00:57:35.84
We'll run our own selection process which

647
00:57:36.08 --> 00:57:39.20
Disgrantled somebody older boys they felt no you have to do pee company

648
00:57:40.16 --> 00:57:45.20
But there was a big difference as well now in the guys that are going Recky troop compared to the guys of old

649
00:57:45.20 --> 00:57:48.64
This guys of old were like you jocker though just huge you know

650
00:57:48.64 --> 00:57:52.24
They're just massive guys. It was all about fitness where is now?

651
00:57:52.24 --> 00:57:59.60
You know the world was sort of evolving the Balkans had kicked off and so five nine commander went to

652
00:58:00.24 --> 00:58:04.48
Bosnia and Recky troop we went to to Kosovo we brigade Recky force

653
00:58:04.48 --> 00:58:08.40
Well, this is the first operational tour the Recky troops since the Folklands war

654
00:58:09.44 --> 00:58:14.000
So the guys in between that period hadn't seen any action and then we then

655
00:58:14.56 --> 00:58:16.96
When I went over to Kosovo which was great for us

656
00:58:16.96 --> 00:58:22.96
Yeah, you you say here one day I called home to the UK with news for my dad

657
00:58:22.96 --> 00:58:26.56
He'd probably forgot along ago about our two minutes conversation in the car

658
00:58:26.56 --> 00:58:30.08
I had and I had a big smile on my face that game the news. I'm going to Kosovo

659
00:58:30.08 --> 00:58:36.56
I told the old soldier. I'm going on tour and this is in this is in 2000 sir if you were gonna do something real

660
00:58:37.84 --> 00:58:40.000
Going into going into the going into the

661
00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:43.60
Going into Kosovo was as good as it was gonna get at that time. Yeah, that time. Yeah

662
00:58:43.60 --> 00:58:52.000
Then what types of missions were you doing there so Brigade Recky force so we were we were doing as you know forward observation

663
00:58:53.04 --> 00:58:57.92
Example one the first I mean into the book actually the first stop we went on it was like

664
00:58:58.48 --> 00:59:03.28
Right we're going on the ground we were on ops and so basically there was a five-key buffers own between

665
00:59:03.44 --> 00:59:08.000
Serbian Kosovo and they didn't want any sort of any Serbians in there any

666
00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:10.72
Codzvans in there because that you know that's where it was all kicking off

667
00:59:10.72 --> 00:59:15.04
So a lot of our work was on the border but there was also those that

668
00:59:16.16 --> 00:59:25.12
Committed horrific crimes crimes of war as well so we were also identified these HVTs get an imagery from them and then obviously again guys to come in and pick them up

669
00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:30.56
So we were having a grab no camera kit straight off civilian shell was an awoken in

670
00:59:30.56 --> 00:59:33.12
We were great the lens and things like that and there

671
00:59:33.28 --> 00:59:39.36
I remember the first job we went on and we insert we had our our intelligence brief we insert

672
00:59:39.36 --> 00:59:45.76
And as we'll patrolling you know to the FRV I was a real man and I kept hearing

673
00:59:46.64 --> 00:59:48.64
Something I'm sorry to that

674
00:59:49.20 --> 00:59:54.48
Stop the team get down on one knee you know all round the fence and we're all looking for our size

675
00:59:55.04 --> 00:59:56.48
There's nothing there but you can hear

676
00:59:57.28 --> 01:00:01.04
Almost like the creep in in the leaves you know someone sneaking up on us

677
01:00:02.32 --> 01:00:07.84
Anyway, this carried on all the way through we got to the position even when we're in the OP position

678
01:00:07.84 --> 01:00:09.84
We could hear it

679
01:00:09.52 --> 01:00:15.20
We got the imagery we needed and about you know two weeks later we we extracted through the field for two weeks

680
01:00:15.20 --> 01:00:18.40
In the two time you're hearing this noise at night you hear these

681
01:00:19.20 --> 01:00:25.84
Probbable enemy approaching your position. Yeah, ready for the fight the whole time you're thinking of the worse

682
01:00:25.84 --> 01:00:30.000
You know you should be there and things that and so when we extracted

683
01:00:30.56 --> 01:00:35.28
We went back to camp and we have the adebrief and I you know any points and like yeah

684
01:00:35.28 --> 01:00:40.48
You know well, I don't know where we were compromised. It felt I will compromise but there was a lot of movement

685
01:00:40.48 --> 01:00:44.000
You know, especially at night and then some some you know

686
01:00:44.56 --> 01:00:51.76
Call of green slime intelligent core this guy that I did forget to mention it is breathing season for the tour choices

687
01:00:52.40 --> 01:00:56.56
So actually what we were sitting here in was the torses that coming out to make

688
01:00:57.28 --> 01:00:59.68
But it kept the whole patrol on stand two for two weeks

689
01:00:59.68 --> 01:01:06.80
So you guys are doing recon patrols how big of a team's you guys were on out with two in six

690
01:01:06.80 --> 01:01:08.16
Man team yeah six

691
01:01:08.16 --> 01:01:13.12
Man team and you're staying for up to two weeks out there. Yeah, we did four weeks once

692
01:01:13.68 --> 01:01:15.68
Yeah, we we got to

693
01:01:16.72 --> 01:01:18.72
Basically we've got an in report in that there was a

694
01:01:19.60 --> 01:01:24.40
A training camp in the in the 5k buffers under Serbian's basically said you deal with them

695
01:01:24.40 --> 01:01:29.68
Or we'll do them and so we insert it remember and you know snow on the ground as well

696
01:01:29.68 --> 01:01:32.80
And because we were out it trained we were the best guys, you know for the job

697
01:01:33.84 --> 01:01:37.12
So we inserted did our tents and we're in observation

698
01:01:37.68 --> 01:01:39.68
OPs for four weeks and

699
01:01:40.72 --> 01:01:44.96
Just feeding back all the intelligence and then they were it was a military training school

700
01:01:44.96 --> 01:01:49.36
They were doing happy heavy weapons training small arms training. It was quite well disciplined

701
01:01:49.36 --> 01:01:55.84
And we'll actually then relieve by the Americans Americans you know came in and took over from us for four weeks later

702
01:01:56.64 --> 01:02:00.88
And I think subsequently from that SF did go in and actually take down

703
01:02:01.44 --> 01:02:03.92
Take down the uh that's training camp, but

704
01:02:04.56 --> 01:02:06.56
For me yeah for weeks in the snow

705
01:02:07.28 --> 01:02:09.28
You know it separates the boys from the men

706
01:02:10.08 --> 01:02:15.28
What is the up tempo like when you'd get back out how often would how much downtime which is getting then you'd roll back out

707
01:02:15.28 --> 01:02:19.44
Now we'd be rolling you know we'd we'd obviously deserve some research

708
01:02:19.44 --> 01:02:25.12
It was it is everything from urban to rural you know we were doing stuff as well in in in vehicles

709
01:02:25.12 --> 01:02:28.88
We had snipers in in in the tall buildings in the middle of Pristina

710
01:02:29.84 --> 01:02:32.16
So the jobs that rains from that to

711
01:02:32.80 --> 01:02:38.16
You know we did get into about one of one of the local government guys is going to be assassination attempt on him

712
01:02:38.16 --> 01:02:41.92
So obviously I haven't keep an eye on him all the time as well and a member actually

713
01:02:41.92 --> 01:02:48.64
Seeing two guys and we we got out we're in civil in a tire and we walked up to walking up towards him

714
01:02:48.64 --> 01:02:54.08
Could we see the bit the guys that we knew we're gonna take him down and they caught our eye and they caught there

715
01:02:54.08 --> 01:02:56.72
And they just went the other way in actually it was a dry rehearsal

716
01:02:56.80 --> 01:03:02.88
We just compromised a dry rehearsal they weren't doing it then which obviously kept him alive from for another mum

717
01:03:02.88 --> 01:03:05.44
Fervent he did get assassination eight after we left

718
01:03:06.56 --> 01:03:08.56
So you had to be

719
01:03:08.56 --> 01:03:10.08
How old are you right at this point?

720
01:03:10.08 --> 01:03:17.68
And not in I'm 22 yeah, so you're just all kind to fire it up for this is living the dream. Oh, yeah, is everything everything you dream about and read about yeah

721
01:03:18.24 --> 01:03:20.24
Doing it for real

722
01:03:21.20 --> 01:03:23.20
You you go through this

723
01:03:23.20 --> 01:03:28.16
This year in the book as you close out this chapter we were just about to head home from coast of Owen we were fastballed onto a task

724
01:03:29.84 --> 01:03:32.72
We're going to apprehend a bomb maker we were told and

725
01:03:32.88 --> 01:03:36.40
The adrenaline began to buzz in my veins sitting through the intel brief

726
01:03:36.40 --> 01:03:42.56
We learned that someone had been cooking up bombs that were being used to take out politicians the bomb maker wasn't the one using them

727
01:03:42.80 --> 01:03:44.80
He was more like a chef for hire

728
01:03:45.60 --> 01:03:50.80
Understandably NATO were keen to get him off the streets. I wasn't the one to grab him

729
01:03:51.28 --> 01:03:55.76
But a couple of the other guys bundled him into the back of our vehicles of our vehicle

730
01:03:56.16 --> 01:04:01.60
His hands were tied behind his back and despite our orders to keep his eyes on the floor he kept looking up and around him

731
01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
I put a hand on the back of his head

732
01:04:04.48 --> 01:04:06.32
to help his concentration

733
01:04:06.32 --> 01:04:10.08
That's bang out of order the man shouted in a sharp

734
01:04:10.56 --> 01:04:18.000
Manchuni in accent as I've ever heard so that's a Manchester accent. My jaw dropped and I looked around with the other guys in the team

735
01:04:18.16 --> 01:04:22.000
Not for one moment had we suspected that the bomb maker could be a fellow countryman

736
01:04:22.88 --> 01:04:26.24
When we dropped him off for questioning I bet he wished he'd stayed at home

737
01:04:26.56 --> 01:04:32.88
There was a solitary chair in the center of a courtyard with two bright spot lights shining onto it

738
01:04:32.88 --> 01:04:38.96
Very James Bond we left the bomb maker to answer first crimes. It was time for us to go home

739
01:04:40.08 --> 01:04:43.92
She gets were running so those are those are great ops, you know great ops getting bad guys

740
01:04:45.44 --> 01:04:47.76
Who'd you turn them over to who's gonna interrogate him?

741
01:04:47.76 --> 01:04:52.16
I'm I think it was our intelligence services. Yeah, relative we gentle then

742
01:04:52.16 --> 01:05:03.36
So then this is the point where you get the offer to or the selected once again to go be an instructor

743
01:05:03.92 --> 01:05:07.20
That's it. Yeah, I have limestone in my center right limestone. Yeah, limestone

744
01:05:07.92 --> 01:05:13.60
So you go to limestone to to being instructor of that commando course which you

745
01:05:14.96 --> 01:05:21.12
Which you'd gone through and the one that you said everyone got fired. Yeah. Yeah, that's it. Yes, and so how was that?

746
01:05:21.12 --> 01:05:26.88
Yeah, great. Oh, it's his great privilege to go back. So so what we used to do with five nine

747
01:05:26.88 --> 01:05:32.32
Recky troop each each troop within five nine had to have a guy who did guard duties and

748
01:05:32.48 --> 01:05:38.96
Think that's so we were exempt from guard duties and from that we would send an instructor on the commander course for years

749
01:05:38.96 --> 01:05:43.36
So you're actually it was again. It was class as opposed in out unit, but you're you were still attached

750
01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:48.24
So again when I talk about being an ambassador and ambassador now for the cat badge

751
01:05:48.24 --> 01:05:54.08
And this is only about four years after me doing my own course. So I always remember my course thinking well, you know

752
01:05:54.08 --> 01:06:01.20
When we were on our course we had to build up the instructors tense. You know we were doing a lot for them when I got there with night and day

753
01:06:01.20 --> 01:06:03.20
Now we did our own tense

754
01:06:03.60 --> 01:06:06.08
But instruction had changed completely

755
01:06:06.48 --> 01:06:07.28
They

756
01:06:07.28 --> 01:06:11.52
We were doing everything that the students were doing. We were wearing the same equipment rooms

757
01:06:11.52 --> 01:06:13.84
We didn't have any you know Gucci kit as well

758
01:06:13.84 --> 01:06:19.36
We were wearing exactly what they they had and because you were you were as an ambassador

759
01:06:19.36 --> 01:06:20.72
You obviously had to

760
01:06:20.96 --> 01:06:26.48
Be seen to be doing what they were doing which I thought was a great way of teaching don't ask at them if you can't do it yourself

761
01:06:27.12 --> 01:06:30.24
And so yeah, it was night night and day

762
01:06:30.88 --> 01:06:37.60
The we had a couple of instructors on the course and you know I soon learned how you can get the most out of of your students

763
01:06:37.60 --> 01:06:39.60
I know when I was on my course

764
01:06:39.60 --> 01:06:40.40
You know

765
01:06:40.40 --> 01:06:43.12
I didn't learn anything and I always remember that I thought well

766
01:06:43.12 --> 01:06:50.000
I don't want this to happen to these young boys, you know, I want them to be in a good position when they go to their unit because you're gonna go back to five nine

767
01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.64
And you're gonna be serving alongside these guys as well

768
01:06:53.68 --> 01:06:57.28
But we had a couple of instructors and they would just come out every morning just screaming shout

769
01:06:57.36 --> 01:07:00.000
You know, I mean, I think the the marine instructors they felt they

770
01:07:01.20 --> 01:07:04.88
They had a bad bad deal going on the all arms commander course

771
01:07:05.68 --> 01:07:07.68
But in fact actually

772
01:07:07.68 --> 01:07:11.92
They enjoyed it they really opened their eyes to how good these guys were at soldier

773
01:07:11.92 --> 01:07:14.64
You know the marines because it's nine months long. They're so

774
01:07:15.76 --> 01:07:18.96
Proud of their tradition and they see these are you know

775
01:07:18.96 --> 01:07:20.96
Jeremy guys coming in and doing 10 weeks

776
01:07:20.96 --> 01:07:24.56
But they don't realize what they've done before they've got there

777
01:07:25.12 --> 01:07:29.04
But these guys were come out and screaming shout and they mean and you can see these students eyes

778
01:07:29.04 --> 01:07:33.28
It's almost like straight into press up position and you know they got nothing back

779
01:07:34.32 --> 01:07:35.60
Whereas for me

780
01:07:35.60 --> 01:07:37.92
It was all about the banter it's about a humor

781
01:07:37.92 --> 01:07:44.16
You need to have a sense of humor and be approachable so if I had to tell them to do press ups

782
01:07:44.16 --> 01:07:49.04
I would do the press ups with a member also there was a law that we could only do 30 press ups

783
01:07:49.60 --> 01:07:51.36
Really a war yeah

784
01:07:51.36 --> 01:07:55.36
Within limestone yeah, they start introducing and max you can do it 30 press ups

785
01:07:55.36 --> 01:07:57.28
But there's ways you can get around that you know good

786
01:07:57.76 --> 01:08:01.20
You can do a press up you can do a half press up you can hold it for a few seconds

787
01:08:01.44 --> 01:08:05.12
Then fully down you know, so we we did that I mean there's ways it weighs around it

788
01:08:05.12 --> 01:08:08.32
But for them as as students you know

789
01:08:08.80 --> 01:08:12.24
I was seeing a better product at the end and probably what they did of me

790
01:08:12.96 --> 01:08:15.76
Four years before so I did like I did like that change

791
01:08:16.16 --> 01:08:22.08
Do you feel like you were able like I was very lucky because I was gotten new instructor roles and they were able to teach

792
01:08:22.88 --> 01:08:24.72
I taught everything it was awesome

793
01:08:24.72 --> 01:08:29.44
I felt like I learned a lot while I was teaching because now you're observing I mean from a leadership perspective

794
01:08:29.44 --> 01:08:34.48
You know us when I was at E5 so I was like a young junior guy I was teaching

795
01:08:34.48 --> 01:08:39.84
The young officers that were going through our basic was called seal tactical training at the time

796
01:08:40.08 --> 01:08:43.76
So I'm out there telling them how to run immediate action drills and tell them like hey

797
01:08:43.76 --> 01:08:46.16
No one's listening to you you need to step back and you take a look around

798
01:08:46.56 --> 01:08:50.88
I learned so much from doing that did you feel like you in this instructor mode got to learn

799
01:08:51.28 --> 01:08:53.28
Yeah, I got to learn it learn a lot myself

800
01:08:53.28 --> 01:08:58.72
Yeah, and like I said we was cool it should get pedestal we used to have to always do the demonstrations before the students

801
01:08:58.72 --> 01:09:00.72
So it's like do not mess this up

802
01:09:00.72 --> 01:09:07.92
So our drills had to be had to be slick and quick, but on my first course we had the first female

803
01:09:08.48 --> 01:09:10.48
Candidate to do the all arms command of course

804
01:09:10.88 --> 01:09:12.88
Yes, in the book you call it we'll tell it why

805
01:09:13.44 --> 01:09:16.40
Lieutenant why yeah, yeah, we had to be a protector name

806
01:09:17.12 --> 01:09:19.12
Legal reasons but she'd done two

807
01:09:19.84 --> 01:09:27.68
She had two previous attempts and this was her third attempt and so the instructors who took on her initial two

808
01:09:27.68 --> 01:09:35.60
Courses were dismissed from the training team and we had another training team saw come in so you can already see it's gonna be it's getting

809
01:09:35.60 --> 01:09:36.64
Steered that way

810
01:09:36.64 --> 01:09:38.000
Who basically

811
01:09:38.40 --> 01:09:43.92
What it was is they wanted a female to pass the command of course and people don't realize it's actually

812
01:09:44.32 --> 01:09:47.04
Basically if a female hadn't passed the command of course

813
01:09:47.28 --> 01:09:52.96
They were gonna lower the standards until a female pass, but that would be standard throughout male and female

814
01:09:52.96 --> 01:10:00.08
So the fact that she went on in past we didn't load a standard so people don't see see the bigger the bigger picture

815
01:10:01.12 --> 01:10:05.52
Behind the scenes so so when you talk about her in the book she didn't pass

816
01:10:06.80 --> 01:10:11.44
He's not that she didn't pass. There was two ladies on the course. There was Lieutenant why and I'll say left in a next

817
01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
Lieutenant X was a

818
01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
Doctor who's actually from five nine and

819
01:10:16.88 --> 01:10:19.12
She did everything that was asked of her you know

820
01:10:19.12 --> 01:10:24.000
She she struggled and things that were as Lieutenant why was almost playing the system

821
01:10:24.56 --> 01:10:27.36
She knew that if she could go to the doctor she will get two days

822
01:10:28.24 --> 01:10:29.20
Like duties

823
01:10:29.20 --> 01:10:36.16
But the way the timings of that used to always before the command of test she'd rest up for a couple of days before the command of test

824
01:10:36.56 --> 01:10:40.32
And it was that it wasn't the fact she did in it's the fact that she played to system well

825
01:10:41.52 --> 01:10:44.72
Lieutenant X, you know she remember one of the guys

826
01:10:44.72 --> 01:10:52.08
Daz who went on to be chief and start to the sniper school. We were doing some close-quar CQB and

827
01:10:53.04 --> 01:10:59.04
You know you'd followed the student through and then at the end you'd you'd give her debrief and he's like it comes through with a student

828
01:10:59.04 --> 01:11:01.04
You said I got it brilliant

829
01:11:01.04 --> 01:11:05.44
And then mediums that chat and then as we looked over it was like a scene from a shampoo

830
01:11:05.44 --> 01:11:08.08
Advice you took her helmet off and just rushed ahead

831
01:11:08.72 --> 01:11:13.28
And we're both who's are I'd you always hit the floor and there's that I said well if she was good

832
01:11:13.28 --> 01:11:17.92
You tell her you know tell it as you was good and he did yeah your accident but unfortunately

833
01:11:18.24 --> 01:11:25.44
Week five you do your your bottom field test was like a an assault course and you have to climb a 30 foot rope and she was about a foot and a half

834
01:11:26.08 --> 01:11:31.28
Just below that rope so she didn't progress on that course, but I do think you know if she had

835
01:11:32.08 --> 01:11:33.92
Non-in-instructed with any quams

836
01:11:33.92 --> 01:11:35.92
Was that Lieutenant X or Lieutenant Y?

837
01:11:35.92 --> 01:11:40.96
Lieutenant X okay, yeah, and but you're saying eventually she did make it through

838
01:11:40.96 --> 01:11:46.48
Lieutenant Lieutenant Y she she made it through on that course. She made it through on that on that course and

839
01:11:46.80 --> 01:11:48.16
It was almost to just

840
01:11:48.16 --> 01:11:52.64
Damping the white noise, you know white white hole that we need a female pass we need a female to pass

841
01:11:53.12 --> 01:11:56.64
But you can imagine what the airborne lads were like you know, I mean it was like oh my god

842
01:11:56.64 --> 01:11:59.84
You know you used to get phone calls my wife some paternity leave for ten weeks

843
01:11:59.84 --> 01:12:01.84
Come down to do your course

844
01:12:02.72 --> 01:12:04.24
Yeah

845
01:12:04.24 --> 01:12:05.44
Good banner

846
01:12:05.44 --> 01:12:09.04
You also talked about a guy that was what 50 something years old?

847
01:12:09.04 --> 01:12:14.56
Yeah, just a beast yeah, so you know even when you know Lieutenant Y passed I was getting blue

848
01:12:14.56 --> 01:12:18.72
He's from the lads there in afghan in like yeah well done, you know, he knows like you know and lads some

849
01:12:19.12 --> 01:12:24.64
Special forces don't even bother coming on selection it's like a big thing a female passing but to be honest, you know

850
01:12:25.20 --> 01:12:29.84
She deserved to pass and I I generally believe that if deserved pass you know you weren't the right and

851
01:12:30.72 --> 01:12:37.36
So yeah the next course this gentleman turns up Captain Fox and he's basically gonna be the family officer

852
01:12:37.36 --> 01:12:40.32
Two nine commando this guy's 55 years old and

853
01:12:41.20 --> 01:12:45.20
He did pee company four years before I was born the airborne in a minute

854
01:12:45.76 --> 01:12:50.72
So we're there on parade and the first thing we do is we do a

855
01:12:50.96 --> 01:12:56.40
I think we do a six mile booted march and it was spring and we came back and it light

856
01:12:56.56 --> 01:13:00.88
You just thrown two buckets of water over this guy and I was at I said you're right

857
01:13:00.88 --> 01:13:04.000
You know Captain 40 so it goes on. Yeah, I've had pneumonia

858
01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:09.28
You know 15 years ago so I can't control my my sweat so that's all my god. This guy's gonna die of me

859
01:13:09.84 --> 01:13:15.12
But this guy basically he had like four wheel records. He was an ultra marathon run. He had I don't know what it was called

860
01:13:15.12 --> 01:13:18.72
But basically has to keep moving has to be physically active

861
01:13:19.28 --> 01:13:24.08
But this guy was was always called I remember when you know teaching the students students messed up and

862
01:13:24.48 --> 01:13:27.60
You know, so I had him on beasty know up and down this this hill

863
01:13:28.16 --> 01:13:31.60
I remember him coming down every time he come to me getting the press up position

864
01:13:31.60 --> 01:13:34.16
I just to feel really embarrassed like talking in my granddad

865
01:13:34.16 --> 01:13:37.20
He's pleased I knocked Captain Fox. I said what is it?

866
01:13:37.20 --> 01:13:38.88
So can I take my warm kit off now?

867
01:13:38.88 --> 01:13:42.000
That god does that yeah, yeah, please do but you know

868
01:13:42.64 --> 01:13:44.96
Really humbling being with him, but I remember

869
01:13:45.44 --> 01:13:48.96
He was in my group and he's we were doing the 30 mileer next week

870
01:13:48.96 --> 01:13:54.88
You know it's the commando test and the final test is a 30 mile and endurance match in in eight hours and at the end you get

871
01:13:54.88 --> 01:13:56.24
You cut a green beret

872
01:13:56.24 --> 01:13:57.76
He said it's a cool story

873
01:13:57.76 --> 01:14:03.44
So the so a grid reference to the finished point and the finished point actually is a public car park on on on

874
01:14:03.44 --> 01:14:04.24
Dartmouth

875
01:14:04.24 --> 01:14:06.24
I say yeah, you shouldn't know it, but this is it

876
01:14:07.12 --> 01:14:09.28
Fine, so when it came to the 30 mileer

877
01:14:09.84 --> 01:14:14.72
You bring him up and so he wanted to know that did he clarify why he wanted that?

878
01:14:14.72 --> 01:14:16.56
It's because he wanted his wife or whatever

879
01:14:16.56 --> 01:14:20.16
Yeah, he wanted his girlfriend to come along say oh my girlfriend wants to meet me the end do mine

880
01:14:20.16 --> 01:14:21.36
No, so yeah fine

881
01:14:21.36 --> 01:14:25.84
So we came over cut the old man's slap. Yeah, yeah, yeah, most of the bruiser

882
01:14:25.84 --> 01:14:29.84
I was older dude say get right on thank you. Yeah, I just said so much respect

883
01:14:29.84 --> 01:14:33.44
room in fact he'd the peak company four years old born so um

884
01:14:33.68 --> 01:14:38.64
So I said yeah of course and then we did the 30 mileer and um on the last phase you bring him up a hill

885
01:14:38.64 --> 01:14:42.000
Coop is hill that you've come bring him in and when you stop him short

886
01:14:42.80 --> 01:14:48.32
Of the end and you get him to sort of themselves out they put their their cap come through on and you know and we marched them in

887
01:14:49.04 --> 01:14:52.48
And so I was doing that and as we came down the corner oh

888
01:14:52.48 --> 01:14:54.48
It was like the Super Bowl. It was

889
01:14:56.32 --> 01:15:00.80
Balloons how is that to my say I thought it was just your girlfriend. So yeah my grandkids

890
01:15:04.80 --> 01:15:09.12
I think this is a good section you had in here just on on you you touched on it

891
01:15:09.12 --> 01:15:14.40
But just the the attitude of being an instructor you say I think a lot of NCOs came into their positions on courses and

892
01:15:14.40 --> 01:15:22.000
And at units thinking that being shouting shouting and swearing was the way to behave because that's how it had been for them and perhaps they thought

893
01:15:22.24 --> 01:15:26.32
It made them feared personally. I didn't want to scare people and to learn it

894
01:15:26.80 --> 01:15:30.40
If they didn't want to be there they'd end up failing themselves without me shouting and screaming

895
01:15:30.40 --> 01:15:35.52
I found it far more effective to use room humor and to be quiet at times when others would shout

896
01:15:36.24 --> 01:15:41.92
Using that old old parent's line of I'm not angry. I'm just disappointed just a look would be enough

897
01:15:41.92 --> 01:15:45.12
They wanted the approval of those already wearing the green lid

898
01:15:45.84 --> 01:15:50.40
And so if they saw that they had failed you they doubled their efforts on the next task

899
01:15:51.04 --> 01:15:53.76
No need for shouting or swearing when you fill

900
01:15:54.32 --> 01:16:00.56
Avoid with swearing it looks rightly or wrongly like it's down the lack of intelligence or to anger issues

901
01:16:00.88 --> 01:16:04.56
Instructors were being assessed by their students just as much as the other way around

902
01:16:05.28 --> 01:16:09.92
I always decided early on that I would have that I would share in any punishment that I handed out

903
01:16:09.92 --> 01:16:14.64
If I gave them press ups then I'd get down to the mud and do them too not only did that earn their respect

904
01:16:14.64 --> 01:16:19.12
But it gave them no excuse in their minds to feel hard done by at the end of the course

905
01:16:19.60 --> 01:16:23.28
Those that earned the coveted berets would be serving alongside me

906
01:16:23.76 --> 01:16:28.48
That's what I wanted to treat them as my equals even if I was in a position of authority

907
01:16:29.04 --> 01:16:33.84
Especially if I was in a position of authority we need each other and that's the same

908
01:16:33.84 --> 01:16:37.52
Whether you're on a training exercise in combat or attempting a world record

909
01:16:37.52 --> 01:16:39.52
No person is an island

910
01:16:41.04 --> 01:16:45.52
Yeah, good a great attitude that I think a lot of people

911
01:16:47.84 --> 01:16:52.64
Could use you know from a leader's not just instructor but from just a leadership perspective

912
01:16:52.96 --> 01:17:00.08
You know that you think maybe you need to yell to get someone's respect no it doesn't you actually lose respect when you act like that

913
01:17:01.76 --> 01:17:03.76
You get done with that

914
01:17:03.76 --> 01:17:08.64
And now you go to see the careers management officer and

915
01:17:09.44 --> 01:17:14.08
He's asking you about what you want to do next now. Did he did he chime in about selection?

916
01:17:14.72 --> 01:17:16.72
Did you see the one that brought up?

917
01:17:17.12 --> 01:17:24.32
You possibly go on a selection or did you already have it in your mind? I had it in my mind so he pulled me in so the whole period of time now

918
01:17:24.32 --> 01:17:30.000
I'm joining five nine to where I was now. I was now a sergeant. I'd spent eight years in five nine and

919
01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:33.60
And that's purely because of the wreckage group the all arms command of course

920
01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:38.24
So normally in in the military you spend three years and then you move on to another unit

921
01:17:38.24 --> 01:17:44.24
You know you progress in your career so to have eight years there and seven an enemy with brigade wreckage is unheard of

922
01:17:44.56 --> 01:17:49.76
So I basically had to move on so I'd put my paperwork in for the pathfinders

923
01:17:49.76 --> 01:17:52.56
Which was the brigade wreckage for the airborne unit and

924
01:17:53.36 --> 01:17:58.96
We each year we have a confidential report and my report was excellent and he pulled me in

925
01:17:58.96 --> 01:18:02.24
It's it can you not see the wood through the trees because you need to go

926
01:18:02.88 --> 01:18:06.40
to then come back as the the wreckage group staff sergeant going

927
01:18:07.04 --> 01:18:09.04
You know pathfinders isn't the way

928
01:18:09.36 --> 01:18:11.60
So you're probably like yeah, give me a bit the roll of it

929
01:18:12.08 --> 01:18:14.08
But that afternoon actually

930
01:18:14.48 --> 01:18:21.68
I got a phone call from Glasgow Glasgow runs all our man in and records. They tell you where you're getting posted and things like that

931
01:18:22.32 --> 01:18:27.60
And so the engineered raw engineered divers we also have raw navy search divers

932
01:18:27.60 --> 01:18:31.04
There've been a few deaths recently in the raw navy divers

933
01:18:31.04 --> 01:18:34.56
And just purely because they're not full-time divers in those you know lack of

934
01:18:36.08 --> 01:18:38.08
Not a kid lack of a protocol

935
01:18:38.08 --> 01:18:42.24
Yeah, yeah, protocol training so it's unfortunately been a couple of deaths

936
01:18:42.56 --> 01:18:45.52
But then HSE had now started creeping into diving

937
01:18:45.76 --> 01:18:51.52
You know when I said earlier that there's no no voice calms and things like that now you can't dive unless you've got two way

938
01:18:52.08 --> 01:18:55.68
Visual camera and voice calms HSE was really creeping into my thoughts

939
01:18:55.68 --> 01:19:00.96
Wait, what's HSE health and safety exact okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, the big the big banners

940
01:19:01.60 --> 01:19:10.000
So they'd introduce the new dive equipment called the Sabre Mod 1 and and that so it didn't disrupt the other diving courses

941
01:19:10.32 --> 01:19:15.52
They introduced another dive team to come in and train all the current divers within the engine is

942
01:19:16.08 --> 01:19:22.88
So I just passed my army diving supervisors and got top student so you know that that same day to sound majors

943
01:19:22.88 --> 01:19:28.08
I haven't been a rocket. I then get posted to the dive school so it was out of both our hands

944
01:19:28.64 --> 01:19:31.04
So I went down as the senior dive instructor

945
01:19:33.20 --> 01:19:37.76
And then you're down there as the senior driving instructor and it sounds like you guys are basically just

946
01:19:38.64 --> 01:19:46.08
Partying a lot because in the block. I mean you guys are divers, but you kind of it's plenty of training people that are already divers, right?

947
01:19:46.08 --> 01:19:48.72
Yeah, yeah, and you're just training them on a new piece of gear

948
01:19:48.72 --> 01:19:53.36
That's it. Yeah, they're already qualified divers, but for them they're going to port Smith

949
01:19:53.36 --> 01:19:56.56
It's like probably coming to San Diego, you know, you've got two weeks in the gas lamp

950
01:19:56.56 --> 01:20:00.24
You know if it is guys, they're saving up their money. So ready to rock and roll

951
01:20:00.24 --> 01:20:02.24
Yeah, but every two weeks you get another

952
01:20:02.72 --> 01:20:08.000
Another course of qualified divers. So for them is it is a holiday they knew that they knew they were passing there

953
01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:11.52
Just going through the procedures. So they're on holiday and they're dragging you on hop

954
01:20:12.80 --> 01:20:18.40
You coming out and you know, I was a single guy's out of course and at one point at what point did you

955
01:20:18.40 --> 01:20:23.12
Realize did you decide you're going to go selection so a couple of months have gone

956
01:20:23.84 --> 01:20:27.12
SAS and we met up about three months later and

957
01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:31.28
You know really open my eyes and I you know

958
01:20:31.68 --> 01:20:37.20
I like to pay hard and they're like you're not even drunk and and I said

959
01:20:37.20 --> 01:20:41.20
Ah, yeah, I'm going to go on selection and it was like one in the back of I know you weren't

960
01:20:41.20 --> 01:20:45.76
I said yeah, well, so that Monday I just stopped drinking and then I train

961
01:20:45.76 --> 01:20:52.08
And I went on I had an attempt at selection before that a couple years before not a long after

962
01:20:52.08 --> 01:20:55.04
Dole Armstrong's command of course and my knee blew out on the hill

963
01:20:55.60 --> 01:21:00.48
How deep into selection were you on that first time when you got blown out me women the aptitude phase the first four weeks

964
01:21:00.88 --> 01:21:06.80
On the hill train so I tore my a tore my lateral miniscus, but my training for that selection

965
01:21:07.04 --> 01:21:10.48
I was up and down the north Devon coastal path and a carrying weight

966
01:21:10.48 --> 01:21:12.48
I was just pounding and pounding and knee

967
01:21:12.48 --> 01:21:17.68
So for me, I didn't want to have that same approach with this attempt also I was running

968
01:21:18.24 --> 01:21:20.24
Dive courses at the time so you anytime I had

969
01:21:20.64 --> 01:21:24.96
You know off was the evening so I spent two hours on on these spin bikes

970
01:21:24.96 --> 01:21:29.92
You know these spin bikes. That's beyond a spinner for two hours each night for six weeks

971
01:21:30.48 --> 01:21:31.92
How was

972
01:21:31.92 --> 01:21:37.52
When you when you got dropped from selection the first time around like you kind of make it like it's no big deal

973
01:21:37.52 --> 01:21:39.52
I only know from my experience

974
01:21:39.52 --> 01:21:45.52
It's a when you if people don't make it through like a basic seal training

975
01:21:45.76 --> 01:21:52.64
It's it's it's horrible because you're gonna be in the regular navy and that's not what you're doing the navy to do and all of a sudden you're doing this other thing

976
01:21:53.68 --> 01:21:59.92
Or you're doing like a regular navy job and that's not good and I can't even fathom like my mindset

977
01:22:00.08 --> 01:22:02.08
If I wouldn't have made it

978
01:22:02.08 --> 01:22:04.08
But it seems like it's a little easier on

979
01:22:04.80 --> 01:22:07.84
Someone that's you know you're sure you were you at five nine

980
01:22:07.84 --> 01:22:11.84
So I was in a rocky trip at the time. Yeah, so you're in wrecky trips. You're like okay. I didn't get through it this time

981
01:22:11.84 --> 01:22:14.40
And I still have an awesome job so maybe it wasn't quite as

982
01:22:15.04 --> 01:22:19.52
Psychologically devastating. Yeah, well, we we you get two attempts at selection you see

983
01:22:19.84 --> 01:22:24.96
So I knew I had another Terry wasn't the bill be all or end all but I learned a lot from that

984
01:22:24.96 --> 01:22:27.92
And it was it was the approach to training you know a lot

985
01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:30.96
You know we have the first four weeks which we'll talk about soon on selection

986
01:22:30.96 --> 01:22:33.12
Which is the aptitude phase, which is the Hills phase

987
01:22:33.36 --> 01:22:34.56
Which is the physical

988
01:22:34.56 --> 01:22:39.04
Once you're at once you pass that is it's when the soldier then comes in and I sort of knew

989
01:22:39.92 --> 01:22:43.52
I just need to get past that first four weeks because soldier and why is now it's been

990
01:22:44.08 --> 01:22:47.76
Years in wrecky trip you know I was on your alarm's team and I was quite current

991
01:22:48.32 --> 01:22:52.64
So when I approached did it the second time like I said I was on the spinner bike for two weeks

992
01:22:52.64 --> 01:22:54.64
So it was low impact and

993
01:22:55.20 --> 01:23:02.24
Actually, we do a run in the UK managed called BFT the basic fitness test. It's a run for a mile and a half

994
01:23:02.24 --> 01:23:06.80
And I got my fastest run at the age of 28. I did like seven minutes ten seconds

995
01:23:07.28 --> 01:23:11.20
So I fought right you know the fitness fitness fitness is up up there

996
01:23:12.40 --> 01:23:15.36
So I then went on selection I decided to

997
01:23:18.08 --> 01:23:20.08
To go SBS I went

998
01:23:20.80 --> 01:23:26.16
Did the do if in called a briefing course because there's two attempts at selection days of old guys

999
01:23:27.20 --> 01:23:31.12
You know if you went from the Marines and Paris guys we go on selection and get caught out

1000
01:23:31.12 --> 01:23:36.40
They'll get a bit culture shock. They didn't realize actually what was involved and what train and

1001
01:23:36.40 --> 01:23:41.60
And preparation you need to do so rather than wasting one life than coming back and potentially getting injured

1002
01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:46.72
Both units and introduced a thing called a briefing course which you can have as many tempts as you want

1003
01:23:47.04 --> 01:23:52.88
And it's a one-week course and basically it's like an absolute it gives you an insight of what where you are fitness wise

1004
01:23:53.68 --> 01:23:55.84
Education wise did you get to do that the first

1005
01:23:55.84 --> 01:24:01.04
The attempt that you do that you have it yet. They didn't have that yet so you had wasted one life so I'd wasted one life

1006
01:24:01.04 --> 01:24:03.92
Yeah, so I went and did the SES briefing course for a week

1007
01:24:03.92 --> 01:24:07.04
I've ended the following week. I went and did the SPS one because I still wanted to

1008
01:24:07.68 --> 01:24:09.36
One and one and make my decision

1009
01:24:09.36 --> 01:24:12.000
But obviously a lot of more my friends are in the SES

1010
01:24:12.32 --> 01:24:17.44
I sort of knew all them and you know sort of the way that they operate and then I went down to Paul in door

1011
01:24:17.44 --> 01:24:22.16
So on our South Coast and then and the guys are there you know they've got frog shores t-shirts

1012
01:24:22.16 --> 01:24:25.04
You've got you know reefs and all the nook of that. Yeah, this and me

1013
01:24:25.04 --> 01:24:27.04
This is where this is where I belong

1014
01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:32.24
So I did both and then you have to make the decision before you gone selection so I said right

1015
01:24:32.48 --> 01:24:34.48
I'm going and that was a new

1016
01:24:35.52 --> 01:24:39.52
Thing before if you were near me you're going the SES if you were in the Marines

1017
01:24:39.52 --> 01:24:42.80
All right, yes, but they take regular Navy dudes into the SPS

1018
01:24:42.80 --> 01:24:50.72
There's only ever been one Navy guy pass although it's the Navel special forces only only one Navy guys pass it up until then it's 100%

1019
01:24:51.60 --> 01:24:52.88
raw Marines

1020
01:24:52.88 --> 01:24:59.68
So normally you or in the past you would have been SAS 100% not even a choice that's you're in the army

1021
01:24:59.68 --> 01:25:02.40
You're going to the SES and at some point during the joint

1022
01:25:02.80 --> 01:25:06.80
Environment of hey we all need to work together. Yeah, they said pick which one you want to go to

1023
01:25:07.68 --> 01:25:12.76
You saw the you saw the you saw pool you saw flip flops

1024
01:25:13.52 --> 01:25:21.36
surf shorts and Oakley's and said I'm I'm heading there. Yeah, that was it the so what it was was the Marines

1025
01:25:21.36 --> 01:25:29.20
Could go to the SES so the Marine the SPS were losing candidates to the SES because not everyone likes diving to see

1026
01:25:29.20 --> 01:25:34.48
Oh, yeah, and some guys have airfields. Yes, as well. It means they can't go underwater so they'll lose in

1027
01:25:35.36 --> 01:25:41.76
Students that that and so they decide to then open up try service that navy the army the RAF can come and

1028
01:25:42.56 --> 01:25:48.48
They're just literally just done that so for me having spent eight years in free command of brigade

1029
01:25:48.48 --> 01:25:52.24
Having the green beret anyway and being the sea indict. It was just seen the natural

1030
01:25:52.88 --> 01:25:57.12
Transition at the perfect transition for me, but in my head I thought well if I go SES

1031
01:25:57.28 --> 01:26:01.12
You know because I'm seeing your diving structure. I'm going to have been boat troop

1032
01:26:01.52 --> 01:26:07.36
If I go SPS these guys are all divers so you know I'm level playing field and that was where my mindset was

1033
01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:11.04
And so yeah, I did it much to the disgust of my friend

1034
01:26:11.04 --> 01:26:17.04
The SES still like what you do it and because it's especially like wreckage it we had a hundred percent pass rate and it was like

1035
01:26:17.04 --> 01:26:21.28
You know if this guy goes then you know people are gonna look at those options

1036
01:26:22.24 --> 01:26:24.64
You know UK special forces 40 percent

1037
01:26:24.88 --> 01:26:29.52
The UK special forces made up of the rule Marines. That's because they were all in the SPS

1038
01:26:31.04 --> 01:26:34.64
You you had to explain this a lot here's the here's the book

1039
01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.72
Talking to your instructors why the fuck do you want to go to pool?

1040
01:26:39.28 --> 01:26:44.08
One of the DS is asked me the special forces selection encompassed all those who want to go to SES and SPS

1041
01:26:44.08 --> 01:26:48.96
So with the exact same training you're gonna go through the exact same training the exact same selection course

1042
01:26:48.96 --> 01:26:52.000
I should say I knew I shouldn't give them a real answer

1043
01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:56.80
I didn't want to go to boat troop and hairford and I like the way the SPS guys

1044
01:26:57.20 --> 01:27:05.36
Cut about in t-shirts shorts and oak leaves as a surfer that appealed to me and pool would certainly put me closer to the surf spots of

1045
01:27:05.36 --> 01:27:08.72
Devon and cornwall. I love diving staff

1046
01:27:08.72 --> 01:27:16.08
Shit answer who likes diving the DS snorted picking up a rock put that in your kit and you better fucking have it when we're it when we get to the end of the day

1047
01:27:16.08 --> 01:27:22.80
I had it with me every day each morning the DS would ask me the same question and each day

1048
01:27:22.80 --> 01:27:25.76
I'd be told to put a rock into my already heavy burden

1049
01:27:26.48 --> 01:27:32.64
Then one day I had an idea my chances of being the gray man were long gone and so I decided to deploy a bit of humor

1050
01:27:33.04 --> 01:27:37.36
Back in the camp that evening. I got busy and in the morning. I was prepared one of two of the

1051
01:27:37.36 --> 01:27:42.000
DS walked over to me. They were both from hairford and both had been at five nine

1052
01:27:42.64 --> 01:27:47.44
They had a keen eye for horrible rocks. Oh, are you? Why the fuck you want to go to pool?

1053
01:27:47.84 --> 01:27:52.80
I placed my weapon down across my boots so it was out of the dirt and opened up the one of the map

1054
01:27:52.96 --> 01:27:58.16
Pockets in my trousers pulling out a laminated photo. What the fuck is this one of them sneered?

1055
01:27:58.40 --> 01:28:02.64
It was a full it was a photo of born mouth my saying that right boom the born with

1056
01:28:02.64 --> 01:28:06.96
Born mouth got him an American. There's a photo of born myth

1057
01:28:07.68 --> 01:28:12.08
Beach during a heat wave. I'd pulled it off a Google and laminated it in the office

1058
01:28:13.12 --> 01:28:16.64
You don't get topless girls on the beach and hairford staff

1059
01:28:16.88 --> 01:28:20.40
I told them with a straight face and both men burst out laughing

1060
01:28:21.20 --> 01:28:24.48
I kept the photo in my pocket for the rest of the course and didn't carry another rock

1061
01:28:27.20 --> 01:28:31.20
Actually one of the main reasons why I'd you well I grew up surfing too

1062
01:28:31.20 --> 01:28:34.08
in in cold the cold water of New England and

1063
01:28:35.76 --> 01:28:40.08
I was looking at you know when I was trying to figure out what I wanted to go into and one of the things that

1064
01:28:40.48 --> 01:28:41.52
was

1065
01:28:41.52 --> 01:28:48.16
Seems like a really good deal was either being stationed in Virginia Beach which is good waves on the east coast and or San Diego

1066
01:28:48.16 --> 01:28:49.84
Which is San Diego and

1067
01:28:50.24 --> 01:28:56.40
Either that you know, are you going to for betting or for Lewis or you just there's some other places to get station

1068
01:28:56.40 --> 01:28:57.76
so that definitely

1069
01:28:57.76 --> 01:28:58.72
helped

1070
01:28:58.72 --> 01:29:03.44
Guide me in the right direction. I didn't know any seals at the time. Otherwise I would have seen

1071
01:29:04.72 --> 01:29:06.000
Sandals shorts

1072
01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.88
Oh, please and that probably would have steered me even more in that direction

1073
01:29:11.04 --> 01:29:16.80
Continue on here despite the rocks. I did really well on the hills the training on the spin bike worked out my joints felt fresh

1074
01:29:17.68 --> 01:29:23.52
On my last basic fitness test the dives go I even ran my fastest time ever 28 years old avoiding injury on the hills

1075
01:29:23.52 --> 01:29:28.08
It's key. There's no time for recovery. If you get hurt you're done. That's that and so as pleased

1076
01:29:28.08 --> 01:29:32.48
That I'd learnt the lessons of my first attempt at selection and adapted my plan accordingly

1077
01:29:32.96 --> 01:29:34.96
Yeah, my buddy John W. He's a

1078
01:29:35.44 --> 01:29:42.64
Bow Hunter and like he's he spends a bunch of time on the stationary bike getting ready for hunting season and I was

1079
01:29:43.60 --> 01:29:47.68
Like I just put on a rock and walk because I'm maybe not as smart

1080
01:29:48.48 --> 01:29:51.20
But yeah, it seems like that's a seems like that works

1081
01:29:51.76 --> 01:29:56.88
Yeah, I think obviously you can have the impact anyway, you know for me when I did the first selection

1082
01:29:56.88 --> 01:29:59.12
You know I've got quite big hill legs so actually

1083
01:29:59.76 --> 01:30:03.52
I send in hills was not a problem where you need to be making up your time is on the

1084
01:30:03.92 --> 01:30:07.68
On the downhill is in on the streets and you know and that's where I need needed to improve

1085
01:30:07.84 --> 01:30:10.48
So that's why I introduced the spin bike because I didn't want to

1086
01:30:11.44 --> 01:30:14.96
Inflame that injury again. I didn't want to you know put starting it in a bad position

1087
01:30:14.96 --> 01:30:18.24
So I just looked at what worked and what didn't you know I knew I was struck

1088
01:30:18.24 --> 01:30:20.000
I had the strength

1089
01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:21.44
You know for the in my legs

1090
01:30:21.44 --> 01:30:27.28
I just didn't have the speed and how was I going to be able to improve on that and that's where the spin and bite was was put as perfect for it

1091
01:30:27.60 --> 01:30:31.28
But the our our aptitude our first four weeks is you know it's

1092
01:30:31.84 --> 01:30:34.96
20 to 30 kilometers you know up to 70 pounds

1093
01:30:36.08 --> 01:30:42.16
You have then then have like the test week and they say you know needs be moving at 4k an hour which things

1094
01:30:42.16 --> 01:30:46.64
That's fine, but that says the crow flies looking at map so if you got mountains in in the way

1095
01:30:46.64 --> 01:30:51.68
You need to get over that mountain so you need to really be moving about 5 to 6k an hour

1096
01:30:52.24 --> 01:30:54.64
Because if you have then have any issues navigational wise

1097
01:30:54.96 --> 01:30:58.64
You know you've got some fudge and you're not scraping in but

1098
01:30:58.96 --> 01:31:05.04
Groundhog day for four weeks doing that on the brekk and beacons in wells is uh and you don't know

1099
01:31:05.28 --> 01:31:09.52
There's no like cut off time. They just tell you to go and get a gun as quick as you can

1100
01:31:09.52 --> 01:31:14.56
That's it. Yeah, you basically get to your your your start point in no the DS will give you your grid reference

1101
01:31:14.56 --> 01:31:16.56
You then step aside workout

1102
01:31:17.52 --> 01:31:23.20
No, which direction you're going tell him in times speed distance and you're sort of working on your your 4k an hour

1103
01:31:23.20 --> 01:31:27.28
How long it's gonna take you and then you go and then you get to the next checkpoint

1104
01:31:27.28 --> 01:31:31.52
Which is the top of the hill where is always meet the DS telling me to pick up a rock and then

1105
01:31:31.52 --> 01:31:35.28
It will just give it a next one and you just keep going until you get to to the finish point

1106
01:31:35.28 --> 01:31:40.40
And they also have a couple of little games in there as well. Wait if you think you finish for the day and allow

1107
01:31:40.40 --> 01:31:46.48
Right your next checkpoint and then you you know you go you start going and then cool a couple of guys out

1108
01:31:46.48 --> 01:31:50.24
They were not they've done and didn't realize actually it was just the test

1109
01:31:51.04 --> 01:31:53.04
You just have to have the

1110
01:31:53.04 --> 01:31:55.04
Self discipline in a self-movey

1111
01:31:55.04 --> 01:31:59.28
Yeah, no you wrote that you wrote about that in the book how they'd come up you think you're done

1112
01:31:59.76 --> 01:32:03.36
You've been walking for what 12 hours 14 hours or whatever it is

1113
01:32:03.36 --> 01:32:10.56
19th day in a row yeah, you come up to the to the drill sergeant and you say

1114
01:32:11.20 --> 01:32:13.52
You know have checking in and he's like here's your next point

1115
01:32:14.72 --> 01:32:17.44
And guys would say I'm done and they'd quit yeah

1116
01:32:18.40 --> 01:32:21.44
And then someone else would come up and say they'd say here's your next point

1117
01:32:21.44 --> 01:32:25.76
They'd start walking say they're just kidding come back and then that guy would realize that they just quit for no reason

1118
01:32:26.40 --> 01:32:30.88
Yeah, I think it was on ours. It was a lot of the the paralleled so a lot of the parachute regimen

1119
01:32:30.88 --> 01:32:36.88
Lads would go as drivers to drive the vehicles on the selections before so they knew the start of

1120
01:32:36.88 --> 01:32:40.72
Vengeance's points and it was actually to catch them out because they're in their head they're right

1121
01:32:40.72 --> 01:32:46.32
Right I've just got 30 kilometers. I've just got 30 kilometers and so the built themselves up and when they get to that point

1122
01:32:46.32 --> 01:32:50.32
They think it's finished and then when you throw a little curve ball in there to let they weren't expecting it

1123
01:32:50.88 --> 01:32:51.84
Um

1124
01:32:51.84 --> 01:32:53.84
But then yeah, I've been test week, you know

1125
01:32:54.64 --> 01:32:59.60
It's called the aptitude fate, but test week itself you then have five marches and if you don't come in

1126
01:32:59.60 --> 01:33:03.52
On the times, you know you get you get red card you get two red cards

1127
01:33:03.84 --> 01:33:05.84
You're done. I think the first three march is about

1128
01:33:06.48 --> 01:33:07.68
30 kilometers

1129
01:33:07.68 --> 01:33:09.68
fourth march is

1130
01:33:09.68 --> 01:33:14.08
35 kilometers, but then you have four hours rest and then that evening you do 40 miles

1131
01:33:14.72 --> 01:33:18.72
Which 70 pounds it's called endurance and you have to do that within 20 hours

1132
01:33:18.72 --> 01:33:20.72
It's called other things because it's like

1133
01:33:22.40 --> 01:33:25.44
Yeah, so um, but you finish that and you think brilliant, you know

1134
01:33:25.44 --> 01:33:30.08
I've just passed the hills for it. It's quite a big thing but finished structures. They call aptitude

1135
01:33:30.08 --> 01:33:31.92
They don't even call you by your name

1136
01:33:31.92 --> 01:33:37.76
They don't even know who you are at this point is like and you probably lost 50% of the course at this point

1137
01:33:37.76 --> 01:33:40.16
I've evolved entry with draw injury

1138
01:33:40.80 --> 01:33:46.32
Or actually just not me yeah the grandiary levels got to be high. Yeah, because that's a beat down on your joints

1139
01:33:46.72 --> 01:33:50.16
I mean what would happen to you the first time yeah, it's exactly I mean obviously

1140
01:33:50.16 --> 01:33:56.40
Like I I broke my ankle as a young boy so my so my nemesis in the military was my my left ankle

1141
01:33:56.40 --> 01:34:00.40
And so it would go well we can edit that out. We don't want everyone to know his weakness

1142
01:34:02.16 --> 01:34:06.64
So for me though, I knew that and I would tape you know I'd tape my ankles up and things that and I'm

1143
01:34:06.64 --> 01:34:07.92
member on test week

1144
01:34:07.92 --> 01:34:08.80
Um

1145
01:34:08.80 --> 01:34:14.96
Had these these military boots lowers had great ankle support because you know because lads were were failed

1146
01:34:15.20 --> 01:34:18.96
They were leaving so in the evening you put your boots in the dry and room and I'm

1147
01:34:18.96 --> 01:34:22.56
Mimma going in the next day and I'm that they look a bit small and

1148
01:34:22.96 --> 01:34:24.96
One of the guys you'd left to take in my boots

1149
01:34:26.08 --> 01:34:32.08
I still had about three more test matches with these with these almost like jungle boots style boots

1150
01:34:32.08 --> 01:34:38.80
You know running across all these babies heads so uh yeah, but you know you're sort of administering yourself looking after yourself and

1151
01:34:39.84 --> 01:34:41.84
Prevention

1152
01:34:43.28 --> 01:34:45.28
um

1153
01:34:45.28 --> 01:34:52.000
You continue on you get past that that phase and like you say in here like that was just the beginning

1154
01:34:52.72 --> 01:34:55.12
And you know they also say this you had to be totally self motivated

1155
01:34:55.12 --> 01:34:58.40
You either had the mental strength that you didn't unlike P company or command of course

1156
01:34:58.40 --> 01:35:05.52
There were no shelter encouragement from the staff anything the DS did say would be an attempt to undermine your confidence

1157
01:35:05.52 --> 01:35:07.52
Make you second guess yourself

1158
01:35:07.52 --> 01:35:08.16
Yeah

1159
01:35:08.16 --> 01:35:10.88
My preparation for the course helped a lot. I never doubted my decisions

1160
01:35:10.88 --> 01:35:15.28
I knew I'd done the work over the years to be spot on with my mapping compass

1161
01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:19.52
I knew I'd left enough sweat and the gym to have my fitness up to standard

1162
01:35:20.24 --> 01:35:24.24
I'm only human and I'd listen to the DS's cutting criticism

1163
01:35:24.24 --> 01:35:28.000
But then I could calmly say to myself it's just part of the mind games mate you're doing fine

1164
01:35:28.88 --> 01:35:32.72
times like those I think back to when my dad had told me I wouldn't last two minutes in the army

1165
01:35:32.72 --> 01:35:34.72
He'd been wrong and so with the DS

1166
01:35:36.56 --> 01:35:38.56
Yeah, they play they they learn

1167
01:35:38.56 --> 01:35:41.84
What to say to people to get them to quit?

1168
01:35:41.84 --> 01:35:45.76
You know they they say all kinds of things and what you said would you see right there?

1169
01:35:45.76 --> 01:35:49.36
It's just part of the mind games. Yeah, but man they go hard. Yeah, yeah

1170
01:35:49.36 --> 01:35:53.44
I do yeah we we we go to the jungle so once we finish the hills phase we

1171
01:35:54.24 --> 01:35:56.24
We start doing some some

1172
01:35:56.56 --> 01:35:59.68
Infantry skills as well because basically you're learning all over again

1173
01:36:00.16 --> 01:36:01.92
So where are you on marine or parah?

1174
01:36:01.92 --> 01:36:06.64
What the way that they operate in UK sf is totally different and you're introducing new weapon systems

1175
01:36:06.64 --> 01:36:14.000
So the C8 the Marco is only used by UK special forces you haven't a learner whole new weapon system again

1176
01:36:14.80 --> 01:36:20.16
And um yeah, but you know from your friends who've done it before you that they're gonna start playing mind games of you

1177
01:36:20.16 --> 01:36:24.32
And I remember we go to Brunei spend six weeks in the jungle and that's that's a great

1178
01:36:25.12 --> 01:36:30.56
Great part selection you lose a lot of guys there. You know some guys really thrive in the jungle and some guys

1179
01:36:30.56 --> 01:36:32.56
It's almost like

1180
01:36:32.56 --> 01:36:39.28
Closter phoat and you know you just spend a lot of time in there day in there and you hear the helicopter coming in and pick up the lads and you see guys

1181
01:36:39.28 --> 01:36:43.76
It's just you guys randomly packing their bags in our cheetah now that what you're doing is it all well, you know

1182
01:36:44.24 --> 01:36:47.52
I'm gonna fail this instructor said you know that ignored instructor said

1183
01:36:47.92 --> 01:36:52.08
But I remember when it happened to me. I remember we were marching up to a

1184
01:36:52.64 --> 01:36:57.84
Arrange and everything we do on selections life firing we don't do blank everything it is for real

1185
01:36:57.84 --> 01:37:03.52
You know because on a day to race you don't fire blank and it's all about weapon handling that you say

1186
01:37:03.52 --> 01:37:07.84
But you know effective and I remember one instructor's coming straight up to me

1187
01:37:07.84 --> 01:37:12.16
Far again in my face screaming in shower and you said if I see any weapon handling like that again

1188
01:37:12.16 --> 01:37:15.92
Because you'll be off you'll be on the next helicopter and I just said yes stuff

1189
01:37:16.48 --> 01:37:21.44
I didn't get into an argument. I didn't be on the range yet. He didn't be like that. You know I didn't be on the range

1190
01:37:21.44 --> 01:37:23.44
I knew it was my day

1191
01:37:23.44 --> 01:37:29.04
That he was testing me and you could see it as well, you know throughout the course you can see I he's getting it today

1192
01:37:29.04 --> 01:37:32.08
The instructor's been on yet. I mean you you get guys

1193
01:37:32.08 --> 01:37:33.04
You know

1194
01:37:33.04 --> 01:37:39.28
Who don't pass and this it I is could I add a personality clash with the instructor and a lot of them tend to use that

1195
01:37:39.52 --> 01:37:44.08
But what they do on selection is it's just great is actually especially with the final exercise at last 10 days

1196
01:37:44.08 --> 01:37:45.60
They swap your instructor's round

1197
01:37:46.08 --> 01:37:50.96
So if there is you know human beings there's always gonna be person I crush is if there is anything like that

1198
01:37:50.96 --> 01:37:57.44
Sort of you get you get a fair chance so um by enjoy it. I enjoyed the jungle for me

1199
01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:04.96
You know I was going through a court case at the time my ex wife and trying to get custody of my my first daughter and

1200
01:38:05.60 --> 01:38:09.92
And I remember passing and we have a barbecue and

1201
01:38:10.32 --> 01:38:14.64
They always say don't go on selection over any welfare issues. You need to go there fully focused

1202
01:38:14.72 --> 01:38:17.84
You know, so guys guys will get letters from their wives

1203
01:38:17.84 --> 01:38:22.48
You know blue ease and she's having a bad day, you know if she's at home with a fridge or cold or blue

1204
01:38:22.48 --> 01:38:27.12
We blew it you just be like blue blue blue envelopes which are free free post garot

1205
01:38:28.08 --> 01:38:31.12
And you know you write in there and it's purely just military

1206
01:38:31.12 --> 01:38:37.76
So it's known as a blue and you know if your wives have an a bad day and she's got kids and she thinks you're on holiday in Brunei

1207
01:38:37.76 --> 01:38:38.80
You know I mean

1208
01:38:38.80 --> 01:38:44.72
And she's I mean you know plays your mind and guys pull themselves off and then phone their wives

1209
01:38:44.72 --> 01:38:49.52
And I'm actually right now, you know, so they do say just cut off all the white noise

1210
01:38:50.08 --> 01:38:54.32
So when I finish my my chief instructors like because I yeah guys come on air

1211
01:38:54.32 --> 01:38:57.92
We're well fit I said I'm going through a divorce and cut through the amy kid is it really

1212
01:38:58.24 --> 01:39:00.88
As there is any place the solicitor's gonna get letters to me

1213
01:39:01.52 --> 01:39:05.36
And actually mean so for me at the time it was a big escape escape

1214
01:39:05.36 --> 01:39:06.88
Yeah

1215
01:39:06.88 --> 01:39:14.40
Just get more I've got a letter as a great but yeah you come back from that and

1216
01:39:15.60 --> 01:39:21.92
I got the troop sergeant role for the final five days of the final attack and you sort that's almost an

1217
01:39:21.92 --> 01:39:26.48
Indicate that you're doing well and so I sort of a newer I've done well on the course

1218
01:39:26.48 --> 01:39:30.48
But when you come out a jungle you have the barbecue the instructors get together

1219
01:39:30.48 --> 01:39:33.20
They have their little you know final decisions

1220
01:39:33.20 --> 01:39:38.80
But you don't know for another five days when you get back to UK they don't they don't tell you there and then it's like

1221
01:39:39.28 --> 01:39:40.72
So you know

1222
01:39:40.72 --> 01:39:46.32
One of them just came up to be at the barbecue at friend of a friend self African land and drunk totally drunk

1223
01:39:46.32 --> 01:39:50.88
So yeah, you've done my house had but you should come as the S so it's almost like you've been given the nod

1224
01:39:51.44 --> 01:39:53.04
I'm officially and

1225
01:39:53.28 --> 01:39:57.68
So you're telling that's anything given a nod. Yeah, I haven't so lads of self critique

1226
01:39:57.68 --> 01:40:03.04
Over the next five days and and I remember the same DS came up to me next day so

1227
01:40:03.60 --> 01:40:08.16
He said study said did I give you the nod last night? I said now he said did you pass?

1228
01:40:08.72 --> 01:40:10.72
You said I did it. Oh

1229
01:40:10.72 --> 01:40:12.72
Drunk

1230
01:40:13.12 --> 01:40:17.60
I was gonna say that's like psychological of the psychological gains. Hey, it's been nice

1231
01:40:17.60 --> 01:40:19.60
No one you've really made good effort out here

1232
01:40:19.60 --> 01:40:25.60
Yeah, but is that actually the the jungle drums it's quite a big thing selection

1233
01:40:25.60 --> 01:40:29.92
You know those instructors who go back they'll sort of tell things they don't take long before it started

1234
01:40:29.92 --> 01:40:32.16
So I've got a text of my friends what I've seen well done

1235
01:40:32.16 --> 01:40:34.16
I've been a person how does this wife know

1236
01:40:35.04 --> 01:40:39.76
In Devon that I'm a path but even though you're feeling confident you've done it

1237
01:40:39.76 --> 01:40:42.32
You still you're still when you walk in five days later

1238
01:40:42.32 --> 01:40:46.72
It's like you know because occasionally guys are getting the down check because whatever

1239
01:40:46.96 --> 01:40:50.000
Yeah, I said you know did they may have got through the jungle phase, but it may be look

1240
01:40:51.12 --> 01:40:54.88
Not this time but with the jungle you only get one attempt

1241
01:40:54.88 --> 01:40:59.92
Is that that that's your only attempt so yeah, that's a that's quite a big big color work as well

1242
01:40:59.92 --> 01:41:03.76
But once you finish the jungle phase you know that they want you

1243
01:41:04.24 --> 01:41:09.12
You know so the next three months you know unless you're a real you know do a Neil diamond

1244
01:41:09.12 --> 01:41:14.32
Negrine negligent discharge or something like that you should you should be safe

1245
01:41:14.32 --> 01:41:16.56
And what's the last three months? What are you doing for that section?

1246
01:41:16.80 --> 01:41:21.68
So you do continuation train so do see survival evasion resistance extraction

1247
01:41:21.68 --> 01:41:24.96
Running through gray coats around Scottish highlands

1248
01:41:25.68 --> 01:41:29.84
You do your your parachute and your square. You do communications kit

1249
01:41:30.16 --> 01:41:32.16
And then the final phase counterterrorism

1250
01:41:32.96 --> 01:41:38.96
So basically they they get you into a position that when you join your sabers quadrant that you can fit into the team

1251
01:41:39.52 --> 01:41:47.20
But you're that's just your start point within the squadrons, but so it's a six-month process. It's actually quite long drawn out and

1252
01:41:47.20 --> 01:41:51.76
We we basically the SPS and SDS as you touched on is it has joint

1253
01:41:52.24 --> 01:41:57.36
Selection and the accommodations at heraphote with the SDS and you'll see in the guys on the course

1254
01:41:58.000 --> 01:41:59.52
Already been given

1255
01:41:59.52 --> 01:42:06.48
Know what squadron they're going to told what the bloyments are going haven't it go see the quartermaster to get kit and you guys in the SPS or that my god

1256
01:42:07.04 --> 01:42:09.04
You know not getting anything

1257
01:42:09.04 --> 01:42:14.32
So it is quite frustrating that they get their berry and belt and then we used to just get given a blue track

1258
01:42:14.32 --> 01:42:22.64
So you've got then another three months continuation. Oh, it's it continues on it does it is still selection or is it just continuation?

1259
01:42:23.04 --> 01:42:24.40
It's

1260
01:42:24.40 --> 01:42:29.12
Days of old it used to be selection because if you failed the dive course they'd accept you in the SDS

1261
01:42:30.64 --> 01:42:33.68
Another whole thing you know what's the difference in the SDS in the SPS?

1262
01:42:33.68 --> 01:42:38.64
I always say surprisingly I've his soldier slightly better soldier you know sort of joking but um

1263
01:42:38.64 --> 01:42:45.04
Yeah, but but actually they then introduced that we then got we then got our own sort unit recognition

1264
01:42:45.04 --> 01:42:49.84
We got our own cat badge recently and you know we got our own belt because days of old

1265
01:42:50.08 --> 01:42:56.64
You wouldn't know who was SPS because it was a raw marine cat badge. That was it. Yeah, the only indicate was there's is long curly hair

1266
01:42:56.64 --> 01:42:58.64
Um

1267
01:43:06.72 --> 01:43:11.28
You go here and a neat club it may have been in the journey to get there was incredibly difficult

1268
01:43:11.28 --> 01:43:17.04
But all of the other men at the squadron. I now joined it done exactly the same so no one remarked on it

1269
01:43:17.04 --> 01:43:21.92
For me selection had been the most monumental thing in my life, but for these guys it was a tick in the box

1270
01:43:22.48 --> 01:43:24.000
To get me to work

1271
01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:26.000
You the new guy are you?

1272
01:43:26.88 --> 01:43:31.12
All right, simple as that. I'd be the the exactly the same way once I'd spent some time at pool

1273
01:43:31.12 --> 01:43:38.64
And the next cadre of new guys came in but for now I was the new book and I was about to begin one of the most intense periods of my life

1274
01:43:38.64 --> 01:43:42.64
What year is this so this is 2006? Oh, okay, so it's on

1275
01:43:43.20 --> 01:43:46.80
So when what where were you in September 11th happened so September 11th?

1276
01:43:46.80 --> 01:43:48.80
I we were about to go on a

1277
01:43:48.80 --> 01:43:55.60
An ex-cycle saves a rear in Oman was a big big ex-size and remember obviously seeing the twin stars

1278
01:43:55.60 --> 01:43:59.04
You know getting pulled into the cinema watching it and then that

1279
01:44:00.32 --> 01:44:05.84
That afternoon I got a phone call from the the dive school saying that you know there's an army advanced diving course

1280
01:44:05.84 --> 01:44:10.000
Start yesterday. I guess they wanted a guys as failed his his entrance test

1281
01:44:10.32 --> 01:44:13.68
So I'd diving courses and in phase it you have been basic course which is

1282
01:44:13.68 --> 01:44:22.000
Which is six weeks you had advanced courses 10 and you supervises you have to pass each before you progress

1283
01:44:23.04 --> 01:44:30.000
And so I got a phone call to come down to dive school so I was heading down the road and then obviously see the twin towers everyone's going to Oman

1284
01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:34.80
I think oh my god. I'm gonna miss out on this and you know, so I missed the initial

1285
01:44:35.04 --> 01:44:39.60
The initial phases and then I was at limsten on the train in team when the lads lads deployed

1286
01:44:39.60 --> 01:44:44.24
So yeah, I missed out with free command to regate my afghan tour so it's a few men

1287
01:44:44.96 --> 01:44:48.24
Few men so my my first deployment afghan was the yes with the SPS

1288
01:44:49.76 --> 01:44:51.76
You say here

1289
01:44:51.76 --> 01:44:55.12
I totally understand that some people will be disappointed that I can't divulge

1290
01:44:55.52 --> 01:45:02.48
Details of special forces operations but our country has enemies and we can't hand them information that could endanger the lives of my former colleagues

1291
01:45:02.48 --> 01:45:04.48
Who continue to operate around the world?

1292
01:45:05.12 --> 01:45:08.24
Selflessly providing the blanket of freedom beneath which we sleep

1293
01:45:08.24 --> 01:45:13.68
I know you'll appreciate that and in light of what they sacrifice we can sacrifice some stories

1294
01:45:13.92 --> 01:45:18.72
Let me just say that those years gave me some of my best friends and that I love the job

1295
01:45:19.36 --> 01:45:23.20
So this is now you're you're going on deployments with the SPS and

1296
01:45:26.48 --> 01:45:32.40
Obviously we're not gonna go any any any details of them where you guys primarily doing like direct action

1297
01:45:32.96 --> 01:45:35.60
Yeah, so when we I was very fortunate my first you know

1298
01:45:35.60 --> 01:45:39.60
I'd missed that opportunity of free command of a guy so I know I went out with the SPS

1299
01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:45.68
My first our first deployment was the first ever operational jump for the SPS into into helmet

1300
01:45:45.68 --> 01:45:49.60
So that wow my first time in afghan and it's an operational jump at night

1301
01:45:50.48 --> 01:45:57.28
So yeah, we were doing it's called task force 42 tier 42 which was the door kick it but also alongside that

1302
01:45:58.72 --> 01:46:00.72
the intelligent services were also

1303
01:46:00.72 --> 01:46:07.60
Pickin up agents and things that so I was having to work between between both normally the instructor the guys

1304
01:46:07.60 --> 01:46:10.64
We were going at with from our reserves and it all failed the course

1305
01:46:11.36 --> 01:46:16.96
So when I first got there it was literally door kick and ignite and then in the day dressing up as a local

1306
01:46:17.60 --> 01:46:20.48
But for me we then did numerous operational jumps

1307
01:46:20.48 --> 01:46:26.96
We were very fortunate on that so we had the most HVTs and any squudgeon and we had more HVTs

1308
01:46:26.96 --> 01:46:30.80
In first three months and the last three squudgeons back to back

1309
01:46:31.52 --> 01:46:35.68
Because we were just changing the way that that we operated as you know out there

1310
01:46:35.68 --> 01:46:41.04
You had to change you know they all knew your TTPs and you had to change and adapt to that so for me

1311
01:46:41.68 --> 01:46:47.60
I was at the pinnacle, you know I'd missed out that time of free command to regail, but I I made up for it in abundance

1312
01:46:47.60 --> 01:46:51.92
And what's your position or are you like a breacher or you a sniper?

1313
01:46:51.92 --> 01:46:53.28
What's your what's your role?

1314
01:46:53.28 --> 01:46:57.76
Yeah, so actually one thing I forgot to mention so unlike so when I went on selection

1315
01:46:57.76 --> 01:47:02.64
I was a sergeant when you finish selection your rank goes you start again as a trooper

1316
01:47:02.88 --> 01:47:07.68
Yeah, well actually they said I was gonna be a marine. I was that awful as said I said that's fine

1317
01:47:08.08 --> 01:47:13.44
But know that no other army light, especially airborne is gonna come in to esps if you call as marines

1318
01:47:13.44 --> 01:47:16.16
You have to call as troopers so when I went there

1319
01:47:16.16 --> 01:47:17.76
I was almost like the guinea pig

1320
01:47:17.76 --> 01:47:20.40
You know what works what doesn't work and things like that

1321
01:47:20.40 --> 01:47:24.40
So yeah, but then you do you were you literally the first army?

1322
01:47:24.96 --> 01:47:31.04
There was two two other guys with two other guys with me. It was an officer and another engineer light in your selection class

1323
01:47:31.04 --> 01:47:36.96
Yeah, and so you three were the first army soldiers to go into the espings

1324
01:47:36.96 --> 01:47:41.44
There was one before those one before us, but it had first time in in this quadrant

1325
01:47:41.84 --> 01:47:47.60
But from the engineers especially record you've been been in the first and I think now 15%

1326
01:47:47.60 --> 01:47:52.000
Of the esps is now made up of the army so it was almost like the floodgates

1327
01:47:52.88 --> 01:47:54.08
Had opened

1328
01:47:54.08 --> 01:47:59.60
Which I think is good because the Marines as I said they're so proud of you know they're background of things that but you need diversity

1329
01:47:59.60 --> 01:48:03.84
You need diversity in there and that's what the army the army brought in

1330
01:48:04.48 --> 01:48:07.04
Also the fact that at the time the SES

1331
01:48:07.68 --> 01:48:12.80
We're running Iraq and the esps were running afghan so again, you know if you guys want to go on selection

1332
01:48:12.80 --> 01:48:14.64
You know Iraq will start to wind down

1333
01:48:14.64 --> 01:48:19.44
You know guys were looking towards afghan so the esps was a good option there

1334
01:48:19.44 --> 01:48:25.36
Yeah, that's my interaction with well I had two interactions with the with the British

1335
01:48:26.16 --> 01:48:29.84
Special forces in my career one of them was before 9-11 and

1336
01:48:31.68 --> 01:48:36.88
It was very cool and I'll tell you about it later and then the other one was

1337
01:48:37.20 --> 01:48:43.84
It was it was just in in Iraq, you know we were hitting target sets and there was like multiple targets that were all

1338
01:48:43.84 --> 01:48:50.000
Somehow connected and so I just sat down next to the troop commander and we want to talk through the plan and

1339
01:48:50.40 --> 01:48:56.64
Really good guy and obviously just you know when people ask me about the the brits and I've I've worked with other

1340
01:48:57.20 --> 01:49:04.000
British units but all of them what I say about the brits the British are just professionals like just professionals

1341
01:49:04.24 --> 01:49:06.24
The way they behave the way they operate

1342
01:49:06.40 --> 01:49:11.92
It's just always awesome. You know they're gonna be squared away. It's um that was always my impression of of the British

1343
01:49:11.92 --> 01:49:15.12
Special forces and of the British military in general yeah

1344
01:49:16.24 --> 01:49:18.40
Except for one person that I'll tell you also tell you about later

1345
01:49:18.80 --> 01:49:23.52
Which was really strange and he was British Navy so which is strange right because that's the Royal Navy

1346
01:49:23.52 --> 01:49:29.76
That's the rule Navy. Yeah, right we should be just totally squared away. Yeah, well that's probably way to drink and drinking

1347
01:49:30.40 --> 01:49:31.60
Problems

1348
01:49:31.60 --> 01:49:33.60
Yeah, this guy was

1349
01:49:33.60 --> 01:49:35.76
I don't know maybe could have used a beard this particular

1350
01:49:35.76 --> 01:49:41.28
How do you draw so you so I cut you off when you were talking about I'd ask you were you a sniper?

1351
01:49:41.84 --> 01:49:43.36
Yeah, yeah, so when you when you joined

1352
01:49:44.24 --> 01:49:46.24
Depends so we have four troops

1353
01:49:46.24 --> 01:49:48.88
So you have air mounting boom and mobility

1354
01:49:48.88 --> 01:49:52.08
I mean you're going there and as I said when you when you pass a lecture and you think

1355
01:49:52.08 --> 01:49:53.28
I've just done six months

1356
01:49:53.28 --> 01:49:58.40
You know you're at the the baseline you're at a now another baseline and you have to then get all these other skillsets

1357
01:49:58.40 --> 01:50:02.000
So we've in the teams is where there's any gaps so whether it's language

1358
01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:05.92
Demolitions, you know I was I was the forward air controller so my was anything to do with air

1359
01:50:06.40 --> 01:50:12.48
Was meat so I was the FAC within art and then that means you're going every mission. Yeah, exactly

1360
01:50:12.48 --> 01:50:15.60
Yeah, yeah, perfect but then you obviously stacking up on the doors

1361
01:50:15.60 --> 01:50:20.40
You know you would be a point man. You know this guy's out there. We've got books like first man in on the leader

1362
01:50:20.40 --> 01:50:23.44
Well, you're not me. You know the first man in is it is the new boy?

1363
01:50:24.40 --> 01:50:27.20
The section commander or the commander is like number three or four

1364
01:50:27.20 --> 01:50:32.40
So but then obviously when you bounce on to the next door just depend who was there. You know, and that's what we used to do

1365
01:50:32.40 --> 01:50:36.56
You know we didn't really have say right we have to go in this order. You know when we did our training

1366
01:50:36.80 --> 01:50:41.60
It was on unrelenting you know we knew it inside out the drills. It was just second nature

1367
01:50:42.08 --> 01:50:48.80
Very slick so but you were so you're just you guys doing a rolling point doesn't matter who goes in

1368
01:50:48.80 --> 01:50:51.04
But did you did you guys have breacher?

1369
01:50:51.12 --> 01:50:53.36
Did you have a special assignment for that because you were in engineer?

1370
01:50:53.36 --> 01:50:57.92
I figured you can say breacher because we always kind of associate breacher with engineer was that enough?

1371
01:50:57.92 --> 01:51:03.04
Yeah, no it wasn't actually when I when I do yeah, so out there. No, it wasn't because it could their

1372
01:51:03.04 --> 01:51:07.52
Demolitions is slightly different from the role engineer demolitions. I know we will take down a bridge

1373
01:51:08.08 --> 01:51:11.28
Not put a nice little hole in no, no, we'd probably drop the whole compound

1374
01:51:12.16 --> 01:51:14.16
We're getting that interesting

1375
01:51:14.16 --> 01:51:20.24
You'd be too you're in two words explosives, but what they tended to do which I thought was great in the special forces if you already have skill sets

1376
01:51:20.24 --> 01:51:25.04
Is you're very you're already got a skill set. Let's give you another skill set, you know, so you sort of build on it

1377
01:51:25.04 --> 01:51:30.24
So like the pathfinder lads who like the airborne wrecky when they go SDS they're already

1378
01:51:30.72 --> 01:51:34.96
Halo train so there's no point in them going air troop. They've got that skill set put them in boat troop

1379
01:51:34.96 --> 01:51:37.44
You know, so they try and give you as many skillsets as possible

1380
01:51:39.20 --> 01:51:43.44
And then how long would you guys go on deployments for so as is six months six months deployment

1381
01:51:43.44 --> 01:51:49.04
We used to do a two-year sort of rule month so six months pre deployment training six months training

1382
01:51:49.04 --> 01:51:53.76
You then come back and then you're on the green roll so you're on the page or for any sort of any other

1383
01:51:55.20 --> 01:52:00.80
situations around the world I mean six months count at terrorism then so hostage rescue and you know

1384
01:52:01.52 --> 01:52:04.52
Domestic and international and then

1385
01:52:07.28 --> 01:52:12.48
When you like I said I think that's enough broad people can kind of figure out what you were doing

1386
01:52:13.68 --> 01:52:17.68
But how long how many years of this cycle were you on?

1387
01:52:17.68 --> 01:52:23.68
So this cycle this I go every every two years so every two years you beat out for for another six months

1388
01:52:24.08 --> 01:52:29.84
Unless you then you spend four years in your Sabre Squadron and then you you have to move on you then get like an instructional

1389
01:52:30.40 --> 01:52:34.80
Okay, so guys tend to do that and then they then come back in and slot in as in team leaders

1390
01:52:35.36 --> 01:52:37.36
Then go for the whole room on again

1391
01:52:37.36 --> 01:52:40.32
So now we're gonna jump into one particular

1392
01:52:40.32 --> 01:52:46.96
Pred deployment training cycle. I'm going to the book. We were in the desert as part of our pred deployment training

1393
01:52:47.60 --> 01:52:51.36
I couldn't wait to get back out on operations nor could any of the other guys

1394
01:52:51.84 --> 01:52:59.04
Being on ops was the reason we joined the special forces and know where were our skills put to the test more than the daily

1395
01:52:59.44 --> 01:53:01.44
Life or death battles with our enemies

1396
01:53:02.64 --> 01:53:07.12
Going on high altitude high opening training. I loved it jumping jumping

1397
01:53:07.12 --> 01:53:15.20
Some guys didn't and just sucked it up, but I always wanted to be the first in the stick so I could stand on the open tail ramp and look down at the earth

1398
01:53:15.20 --> 01:53:18.40
Beneath me. I wanted to soak it all in before I jumped

1399
01:53:18.64 --> 01:53:21.68
But on the second jump that day I was put in the back of the line

1400
01:53:22.48 --> 01:53:29.36
I waddled with my kit toward the door as the others left the aircraft one guy tumbleed out after the next

1401
01:53:30.16 --> 01:53:32.16
Eventually it was my turn. I jumped

1402
01:53:33.44 --> 01:53:36.40
And immediately I knew that's I was in trouble

1403
01:53:36.40 --> 01:53:41.68
I felt something on my leg. I looked up and saw that it was wrapped in rigging

1404
01:53:42.80 --> 01:53:46.16
I knew that as soon as the static line pulled up the canopy

1405
01:53:46.56 --> 01:53:51.20
That rigging would shoot up above my head and the force of it would take my leg with it

1406
01:53:52.08 --> 01:53:54.32
I had a second to get my leg clear

1407
01:53:55.52 --> 01:53:56.56
Wack

1408
01:53:56.56 --> 01:54:00.48
I failed the static line pulled the shoot the shoot pulled the rigging

1409
01:54:00.48 --> 01:54:07.04
The rigging pulled my leg it came up and over my shoulder like I was a yoga guru

1410
01:54:07.52 --> 01:54:11.28
Instantly I felt every muscle ligament and tendon rip and snap

1411
01:54:12.16 --> 01:54:17.28
I screamed in absolute agony and almost blocked out from the pain the rigging worked its way clear

1412
01:54:17.28 --> 01:54:21.92
And now the leg fell back alongside the other, but I knew that I had no control over its movement

1413
01:54:22.40 --> 01:54:26.48
I was lucky to still have the leg the force could have easily ripped it off and if that happened

1414
01:54:26.48 --> 01:54:31.84
I'd have blooded the death within minutes and some poor local would have had a one-legged corpse landing in his garden

1415
01:54:32.96 --> 01:54:36.56
Pain was racing through my body, but I knew that if I didn't get my act together

1416
01:54:36.56 --> 01:54:42.16
I could still die. I was so far up that axe oxygen was thin and I could not afford to pass out

1417
01:54:42.16 --> 01:54:45.20
I drifted away from my guys if I drifted away from my guys

1418
01:54:45.20 --> 01:54:47.60
I could end up in the middle of the desert or the sea

1419
01:54:48.32 --> 01:54:53.28
It would be browners. I had to stay awake. You'd think that the pain would have made that easy

1420
01:54:53.28 --> 01:54:56.72
But it was so intense that my brain was trying to send me into unconsciousness

1421
01:54:57.76 --> 01:55:04.72
I wouldn't let it. I just wouldn't instead I fixed my focus on the descending parachutes of the stick and followed them in

1422
01:55:04.80 --> 01:55:07.04
It was the longest 30 minutes of my life

1423
01:55:07.20 --> 01:55:13.12
Despite the physical agony I had time had enough time hanging in the sky to feel emotional pain too

1424
01:55:13.36 --> 01:55:15.84
I knew that there would be no deployment for me now

1425
01:55:16.40 --> 01:55:20.32
I think I knew deep down that there would be no more time on operations at all

1426
01:55:20.32 --> 01:55:25.04
30 minutes is a long time to think about that when you're alone floating through the air

1427
01:55:25.76 --> 01:55:29.60
Finally the ground was getting closer. I saw my mates landing information

1428
01:55:29.68 --> 01:55:34.40
I wanted to make a good landing out of pride, but more than that I knew that if I landed badly

1429
01:55:34.40 --> 01:55:37.52
I could quite well ruin my good leg too

1430
01:55:38.40 --> 01:55:44.16
The ground came up to meet me. I pushed down on my toggles and flared the shoot just at the right moment

1431
01:55:44.32 --> 01:55:48.96
Dragging in enough air under the canvas to take the speed out of my descent

1432
01:55:48.96 --> 01:55:53.44
If you do it too early you just stop in the sky then drop like a sack of shit

1433
01:55:53.44 --> 01:55:56.32
But I came in like a feather and landed on one leg

1434
01:55:57.76 --> 01:55:59.76
There was only one thing left to do

1435
01:56:01.28 --> 01:56:03.28
medic

1436
01:56:05.28 --> 01:56:10.88
What year was that so that was 2000 and 10 so

1437
01:56:12.16 --> 01:56:14.16
Man

1438
01:56:14.16 --> 01:56:21.04
That's it. I mean you're leg. Did you know instantly you were you were done? Yeah, you know it was actually

1439
01:56:21.76 --> 01:56:24.80
The new guys who come to the squadron were getting hayhoe train

1440
01:56:24.88 --> 01:56:28.56
So our sergeant made us that we'd already we're already hayhoe train from previous tours

1441
01:56:28.56 --> 01:56:33.20
He's that we'll go do fun jumps. You know I'd like jumping but there's no such thing as a fun jump in the military

1442
01:56:33.84 --> 01:56:35.04
And

1443
01:56:35.04 --> 01:56:38.08
The reason I got moved I normally am at the front I like to frog

1444
01:56:38.24 --> 01:56:42.24
No, he takes it turn around and he exits the PGI so it's you saw his upset the

1445
01:56:42.24 --> 01:56:47.44
Yeah, the RIF so I then got moved to the back of the stick and like I said we'd done

1446
01:56:48.24 --> 01:56:52.48
Numerous at each jumps just routine but as I exit it got caught in a lines on

1447
01:56:53.28 --> 01:56:57.84
Kick it trying to kick it in time and I couldn't I mean when it got pulled up and over you know

1448
01:56:58.56 --> 01:57:00.80
Probably hear me from the ground screaming

1449
01:57:01.36 --> 01:57:03.36
So but no one else in the team is aware

1450
01:57:03.36 --> 01:57:05.36
That's anything and I've been going on

1451
01:57:06.32 --> 01:57:07.84
But because of those

1452
01:57:07.84 --> 01:57:14.32
Fin out with you or drifting in and out the I was a vomiting because of the pain. I just needed to get I just wanted to get to the ground

1453
01:57:14.56 --> 01:57:16.72
See and re establish what's what's going on

1454
01:57:18.32 --> 01:57:24.40
Assessed the other parachutes their approach you know took another look over the dz and landed it one leg

1455
01:57:24.40 --> 01:57:27.84
It but no straight away. I can put any pressure on it. You know

1456
01:57:28.08 --> 01:57:32.32
Got us got we got a medic medic back to the camp

1457
01:57:32.32 --> 01:57:38.88
Had a MRI scan the next day and there's like yeah, you've torn your ACL or your MCL

1458
01:57:38.88 --> 01:57:43.12
You're lateral meniscose your hamstring your calf you quad so all the supporting muscles as well

1459
01:57:43.12 --> 01:57:48.48
So it's normally with an ACL or MCL you can carry on you see rugby players and just carrying on

1460
01:57:48.48 --> 01:57:50.48
But it was all the support of muscles

1461
01:57:50.48 --> 01:57:53.20
But to add to the issue as well the

1462
01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:59.76
It was the Icelandic volcano which grounded aircraft all over the world so they couldn't get an error mid to me

1463
01:57:59.76 --> 01:58:04.80
So I basically was just thrown into the hotel in Muscat the lads went on to talk from there

1464
01:58:05.44 --> 01:58:12.000
I was putting a hotel for four weeks with painkillers. No sort of deteriorating got back to UK

1465
01:58:13.04 --> 01:58:16.08
After an error med sent home for six weeks

1466
01:58:17.04 --> 01:58:23.44
Back to the hospital and they lost all my paperwork and it was just a spiral of of errors within the military medical system

1467
01:58:24.80 --> 01:58:29.36
How long did it take for you to get through I mean how long did it get surgery and you talk about it in the book

1468
01:58:29.36 --> 01:58:34.96
But how long was that it was 44 weeks in the end you know my when I injured my leg on the first selection process

1469
01:58:34.96 --> 01:58:40.000
It was five days and then I was running again in six weeks until me 44 weeks to get there

1470
01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:44.48
So you know my whole my leg had deteriorated completely and then for me

1471
01:58:44.48 --> 01:58:45.52
I was then

1472
01:58:45.52 --> 01:58:50.08
Transitioning to civilian streets. I wasn't really focused on my my rehab it's like

1473
01:58:50.80 --> 01:58:56.32
What am I gonna do next did you your uh at what point did did you know did somebody say hey

1474
01:58:56.32 --> 01:59:01.20
That's it you you can't be here anymore. Do they offer you medical retirement like what did that process like like

1475
01:59:01.68 --> 01:59:03.84
You'd like to think they'd offer you medical retirement

1476
01:59:04.08 --> 01:59:07.84
But it didn't you know I had to almost threaten them and I needed

1477
01:59:09.44 --> 01:59:13.20
With legal that I needed the operation and when I left

1478
01:59:13.20 --> 01:59:20.08
They pay scale it they put me out and was one below a medical pension and it said you were fixed within 26 weeks

1479
01:59:20.48 --> 01:59:22.48
I was at what else it was 44 weeks

1480
01:59:22.48 --> 01:59:27.76
So five years later I had a tribunal here and against the military and

1481
01:59:28.80 --> 01:59:30.80
What the military tend to do is

1482
01:59:31.92 --> 01:59:37.20
It's basically guys that appeal it they'll say no and you can appeal it again and they'll say no

1483
01:59:37.20 --> 01:59:41.92
That they'll lose eight percent of people doing that so I know a general who said to me

1484
01:59:41.92 --> 01:59:46.64
He said just keep appealing said they won't even open your case until it's deferred appeal

1485
01:59:47.12 --> 01:59:48.64
Which is five years later

1486
01:59:48.64 --> 01:59:56.16
So that's why I did and then I had a tribunal hearing in in Edinburgh and I went down and actually you had a QC in front of you and two doctors

1487
01:59:56.56 --> 01:59:57.92
from the military

1488
01:59:57.92 --> 02:00:01.92
I then brought a military charity called the Royal British Legion and they just sort of

1489
02:00:02.64 --> 02:00:07.60
Ask certain questions which will get you a story out and then you have a representative from the military veterans

1490
02:00:08.48 --> 02:00:10.48
Appeal in you and normally they can be quite

1491
02:00:11.36 --> 02:00:13.60
Aggressive but this guy was actually quite quite relaxed

1492
02:00:13.60 --> 02:00:20.48
But someone did say to me the week before it's a look when you go on this that he go he he had one and he didn't get his medical pension

1493
02:00:20.48 --> 02:00:22.16
He said when you go in there you can't be

1494
02:00:22.80 --> 02:00:23.84
Dean stopped

1495
02:00:23.84 --> 02:00:27.84
Special forces you know these guys say can you walk down the street you say no?

1496
02:00:27.92 --> 02:00:30.64
You know it was one answer so I had that in the back of my mind

1497
02:00:30.64 --> 02:00:34.40
They're I went in and actually they had the timeline that I'd printed out and

1498
02:00:34.96 --> 02:00:37.68
You know I then ended up getting a full

1499
02:00:37.68 --> 02:00:43.28
Full medical pension and then back dated but in the fact that I had to go through it my own yeah

1500
02:00:43.60 --> 02:00:47.52
It's crazy so you like to think you know especially when you feel like you're the top again

1501
02:00:47.52 --> 02:00:48.64
You feel like you're a pop star

1502
02:00:48.64 --> 02:00:52.64
I mean you know tier one special forces and just this all it almost put a

1503
02:00:53.76 --> 02:00:57.04
Cloud over my my career and not my career

1504
02:00:57.04 --> 02:00:59.44
But that my last last year in the military

1505
02:00:59.44 --> 02:01:01.04
It's a bad to at least do the bad taste

1506
02:01:01.04 --> 02:01:04.80
Let me have had taste and I didn't actually realize until I was successful

1507
02:01:04.80 --> 02:01:09.12
How you know what a weight was on my shoulders you know what I felt when I got it

1508
02:01:09.12 --> 02:01:10.96
I felt I've been reciprocated for my time

1509
02:01:10.96 --> 02:01:15.52
You know things and I could almost close that chapter and move on but that was five years after leaving

1510
02:01:15.84 --> 02:01:20.40
How many years then did you how many years were you in total 16?

1511
02:01:22.16 --> 02:01:24.16
So 16 years in and

1512
02:01:24.72 --> 02:01:26.80
So you get what from the day you got injured

1513
02:01:27.36 --> 02:01:29.04
How long did it take before you said all right?

1514
02:01:29.04 --> 02:01:31.36
I need I'm gonna get out because I can't do my job anymore

1515
02:01:31.36 --> 02:01:37.44
So it was over nearly year and I had to extend because I hadn't even been operated on and the military

1516
02:01:37.44 --> 02:01:40.56
Have to return it to civilian street in similar

1517
02:01:40.56 --> 02:01:44.32
Conditional best condition. They were one what you entered and I was nowhere near that so

1518
02:01:44.64 --> 02:01:49.44
So for me my mindset in my heads now thinking well, I'm not I'm not in the militia anymore

1519
02:01:49.44 --> 02:01:55.20
I need to look look beyond that but you still can't progress because you're waiting on on this operation

1520
02:01:55.20 --> 02:01:58.72
So I I got it in the end and then then I finally left in May

1521
02:01:58.72 --> 02:02:04.32
2011 is when I she got out and then as you're working through this transition

1522
02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:08.000
At some point you get a call

1523
02:02:08.32 --> 02:02:14.80
It's can you be in Libya tomorrow? Yeah, yeah, so to add to the pressure you know

1524
02:02:15.44 --> 02:02:18.56
You know when you know we talk about identity crisis you spent

1525
02:02:19.52 --> 02:02:22.96
All this time in the military working in a tiny net unit, you know

1526
02:02:23.44 --> 02:02:26.56
Knowing what you're doing day out working alongside professionals to like

1527
02:02:26.56 --> 02:02:30.88
Where do I now fit in society? What is my role? What is my purpose?

1528
02:02:31.44 --> 02:02:34.24
So I had that going on in my head. I hadn't really had

1529
02:02:34.96 --> 02:02:38.72
That full transition so guys when they're getting out they have like two year build up

1530
02:02:38.80 --> 02:02:42.24
You know to do all these workshops and these and this set up their companies my was almost

1531
02:02:42.72 --> 02:02:47.28
You know crash bang your you're out the door my wife at this point was eight months pregnant

1532
02:02:47.28 --> 02:02:52.32
You know some like I got it's any workout there, you know what I'm gonna do and we're out of sound like Liam Neeson

1533
02:02:52.32 --> 02:02:59.28
People with our skill sets tends to be the private security industry so this was the middle of the Arab spring

1534
02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:06.96
And get afy was still in triply at this point and in Benghazi a lot of the oil companies the security companies the media

1535
02:03:07.36 --> 02:03:12.96
We're forming up and my friend who was a director one a large security company said

1536
02:03:13.76 --> 02:03:18.56
Dean can you be in Libya and I said yeah course account so I went I went straight in and basically it was a

1537
02:03:18.56 --> 02:03:24.96
It was a difficult project department for an institute development which was the you know at a time with the Prime Minister's little baby

1538
02:03:25.04 --> 02:03:32.88
So they were going to the these sort of countries and you'd have representatives from the the financial sector from the medical and

1539
02:03:32.88 --> 02:03:38.16
You know the military and it's to base the advice and help these these countries get back on their feet

1540
02:03:39.60 --> 02:03:45.44
So they're all preparing for the good afy so I he said can you go in can you help set up the difficult project?

1541
02:03:45.44 --> 02:03:50.80
I'm gonna fly 30 um private security operators in from Iraq and Afghanistan

1542
02:03:51.44 --> 02:03:53.44
So I went in and

1543
02:03:53.84 --> 02:03:57.20
Straight away I could see there was no threat you know the Libions

1544
02:03:57.76 --> 02:04:03.12
We were very hospitable but it also were quite adamant that they didn't want this being an other afghanistan

1545
02:04:03.36 --> 02:04:07.84
In Iraq you know one's get afied for and they wanted to take control of their country

1546
02:04:07.84 --> 02:04:10.000
They didn't want in a private security

1547
02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:15.28
So we had these MP7s these weapons and these guys came in two days later from this hook

1548
02:04:15.60 --> 02:04:21.68
You know these hurt from Afghan and Iraq and where's our weapons and I'd sort of sort of changing their mindset

1549
02:04:21.68 --> 02:04:25.36
There actually there is no friend and you know needs to be all all low key

1550
02:04:26.56 --> 02:04:28.56
I was also trying to find

1551
02:04:29.84 --> 02:04:36.48
A niche within the industry and I was looking at all these other security companies a lot of my friends had there their security companies were doing

1552
02:04:36.48 --> 02:04:40.88
Anti piracy of these coast of Africa so I don't want to tread on their feet

1553
02:04:41.92 --> 02:04:47.60
So somebody big security companies I identify with charging you know six figure sums for crisis management

1554
02:04:47.60 --> 02:04:51.92
And evacuation plans, but when you just scrape the surface and there was nothing in place

1555
02:04:52.88 --> 02:04:59.36
So I haven't spent two weeks set that up. I am I flew back home and Alana gave birth to I thought Molly and

1556
02:05:00.64 --> 02:05:02.64
I said I think I've got a plan

1557
02:05:02.64 --> 02:05:06.08
So I went back in to Libya and

1558
02:05:07.36 --> 02:05:14.80
And there's a huge proliferation of weapons at the time. It's actually how many shins it was difficult to go all of so I bought 30 weapons on the black market

1559
02:05:14.80 --> 02:05:18.72
And I buried them between tuners and Egypt and I just spent a month in the desert

1560
02:05:19.36 --> 02:05:25.76
Just occasion these pelicases with coms kits and money and just wrote my own evacuation plans hoping

1561
02:05:26.16 --> 02:05:30.000
Never to really really need them and that's why I did we lived in Aberdeen which was the

1562
02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:35.28
All-in-gas capital of Europe so I had a good links to the oil and gas sector and that's what I did

1563
02:05:35.28 --> 02:05:39.04
I then that was my niche I'd found an niche within within the industry

1564
02:05:40.08 --> 02:05:45.60
So yeah now did you set that up where you were talking to the oil companies and I've been to Aberdeen thankfully

1565
02:05:46.08 --> 02:05:49.76
Very cool. Have you ever served there? I haven't no, but I know

1566
02:05:50.24 --> 02:05:54.88
I'm a third so firm enough is it wanted a great spot. I was there in like the winner and

1567
02:05:55.36 --> 02:05:58.80
You could have served it like it wouldn't have been fun, but you could have served

1568
02:05:58.80 --> 02:06:03.68
I was looking at the waves I went for a little run down there and I was looking at the waves and I was like well you could do it

1569
02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:06.40
You could do it, but we're making not fun

1570
02:06:07.20 --> 02:06:09.20
Pro-rece-frizing choppy

1571
02:06:09.84 --> 02:06:15.04
Is like barely you could price her for about you know two seconds or three seconds per wave

1572
02:06:15.52 --> 02:06:19.20
You'd have the waves to yourself though there was no water. There's no even on the beach

1573
02:06:20.72 --> 02:06:22.16
So did you did you

1574
02:06:22.16 --> 02:06:29.76
Set that those all that gear up and then go and pitch to clients like hey I've got these plans set up

1575
02:06:29.76 --> 02:06:33.84
Here's what I can do for you and then are they giving you some kind of revenue upfront?

1576
02:06:33.84 --> 02:06:38.32
Yeah, so it's it's basically I'd identified that I'd wrote them up first

1577
02:06:38.32 --> 02:06:42.000
You know because it's also right I have this plan in place, you know

1578
02:06:42.56 --> 02:06:49.76
I had the case it's in my own sort of mindset with it was I and I knew that the Libyan's didn't want security companies

1579
02:06:49.76 --> 02:06:55.52
We're weapons so before long we we could do that some I sort of mindset was if there was a situation

1580
02:06:55.52 --> 02:07:00.56
We could drive across the border unarmed you know go to the case points pick them up

1581
02:07:00.56 --> 02:07:05.60
It would need the if we needed weapons and you know and then and get you know decline out and then I'm in barium

1582
02:07:05.60 --> 02:07:06.88
That was it so

1583
02:07:06.88 --> 02:07:13.20
It was almost like a retainer knowing that that service was there and then we used to I used to have like

1584
02:07:13.92 --> 02:07:15.20
Triggers you know

1585
02:07:15.20 --> 02:07:21.52
You know if there's a certain situation we go up to yellow we go up to amber so really you should never if if you're a deer into that

1586
02:07:21.52 --> 02:07:23.92
Trigger system that you have in place you shouldn't really

1587
02:07:24.72 --> 02:07:27.84
Need to go for a line evacuation the only thing that sort of

1588
02:07:29.12 --> 02:07:32.56
Is it is natural disasters that's where you can go from green to red overnight

1589
02:07:32.56 --> 02:07:37.60
There's it's a natural disaster so really if you have that in place, but that's something I just picked up from the military

1590
02:07:38.32 --> 02:07:44.80
Was it was these case systems in these case sister how to see with the IRA and the Taliban use these case systems

1591
02:07:44.80 --> 02:07:49.84
That's where it originates and but for me it just wasn't I was walking around with weapons, but I knew

1592
02:07:50.88 --> 02:07:55.68
I had safe houses and I knew that a weapons available if needed and you built relationships

1593
02:07:55.68 --> 02:07:58.72
And you talk about that a lot here. Yeah, yeah, you know

1594
02:07:59.92 --> 02:08:01.92
Sort of you know I when I got out as well

1595
02:08:01.92 --> 02:08:07.20
I didn't want to be going out to Afghanistan and Iraq you know I've done my time in the dead

1596
02:08:07.20 --> 02:08:13.68
It no I sort of the security cut security industry isn't risk reward ratio balance at all

1597
02:08:13.68 --> 02:08:19.12
You know you could be in Yemen, Libya or Somalia on 50% of what you're on taking the UAE rule family

1598
02:08:19.12 --> 02:08:24.64
Superio from Barcelona to Maldeeps. I was that well, where's the money and it's in the corporate close protection

1599
02:08:24.64 --> 02:08:30.40
So I didn't have cargo pants and tight tops, you know it was like it was a nice dinner jacket

1600
02:08:30.40 --> 02:08:34.32
Sure and and brooks and and that was that was my approach, but

1601
02:08:34.88 --> 02:08:39.28
Everyone has this perception of special forces you know is about offensive action

1602
02:08:39.28 --> 02:08:44.56
It's you know breaching walls is it's kicking indoors and things that that's 25% of what we do

1603
02:08:44.96 --> 02:08:46.96
50% of what we do is is

1604
02:08:47.20 --> 02:08:52.64
Support an influence it's hearts and minds being embedded with the locals understanding actually what is

1605
02:08:53.12 --> 02:08:56.72
The situation on the ground not what I'm seeing on TV, but what is actually

1606
02:08:57.12 --> 02:08:58.96
Basically going on underground

1607
02:08:58.96 --> 02:09:00.96
So for me, I really built up

1608
02:09:00.96 --> 02:09:02.96
Good relationships with local fixes

1609
02:09:02.96 --> 02:09:08.88
You know there's 167 tribes and Libya so my fixer in triply isn't the same fixer in Benghazi

1610
02:09:08.88 --> 02:09:13.44
So I I quickly understood that especially during that that Arab spring and

1611
02:09:14.24 --> 02:09:19.20
I just returned from the London Olympics. I was providing security for visa and

1612
02:09:20.08 --> 02:09:23.52
I was in Benghazi the evening that you were American ambassador got killed

1613
02:09:24.08 --> 02:09:28.48
September 11, 2012 and I got a phone call could I escort

1614
02:09:29.04 --> 02:09:33.92
Help a German oil company and eight German engineers get them out on Benghazi

1615
02:09:34.24 --> 02:09:38.000
So while it was all I think I made a film 30 now as well as all kicking off in the sea

1616
02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:40.000
I got these guys safely

1617
02:09:40.48 --> 02:09:45.76
From Benghazi to triply through safe houses that I had in the desert and they again

1618
02:09:45.76 --> 02:09:50.48
I remember we had drivers from Benghazi and we got to the safe house and we could you know

1619
02:09:50.48 --> 02:09:52.48
We could drive to triply in a day

1620
02:09:52.48 --> 02:09:59.52
But I said no we'll wait here for 48 hours which was worrying the engineers a bit and the Benghazi guys had like big big

1621
02:09:59.52 --> 02:10:00.72
Bids and

1622
02:10:00.72 --> 02:10:04.64
Oh no no Mr Dean we can go. I said no no we wait 48 hours

1623
02:10:04.64 --> 02:10:10.72
But they were nervous. I knew there were nervous going into triply because they're from the wrong region

1624
02:10:11.52 --> 02:10:17.12
Well, what they weren't aware of as I was getting drivers coming in from triply to meet as they would carry on

1625
02:10:17.52 --> 02:10:22.16
It's that sort of knowledge knowing who to use and when to use and

1626
02:10:22.72 --> 02:10:25.68
Remember the morning we'll leave in in this poor guy some Benghazi

1627
02:10:25.68 --> 02:10:31.52
I couldn't tell them they'd shave all their bids and I was doing outside and the triply driver to turn up

1628
02:10:31.52 --> 02:10:35.44
It was like a almost like a scene from the okay carol. They all start going for their weapons

1629
02:10:35.44 --> 02:10:40.000
I said look I said I cannot take you to triply you will compromise us

1630
02:10:40.80 --> 02:10:45.04
These guys can do it and I said look you will still get paid and it's just all about

1631
02:10:45.84 --> 02:10:50.56
Respect you know I always say about communication but for that operation I couldn't I couldn't

1632
02:10:50.96 --> 02:10:56.56
Dive old too much to them so I got them safely out and then two years later I was in

1633
02:10:57.68 --> 02:11:00.000
Brazil for visa again coming to woke up

1634
02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:05.68
And I then get a phone call from the Canadian embassy so what had happened now is the triply war

1635
02:11:05.68 --> 02:11:08.08
It's a civil war between the militias and the government and

1636
02:11:10.80 --> 02:11:14.96
Embassies the only reason embassies are in countries all about trade and investment

1637
02:11:15.28 --> 02:11:19.20
You know what can we get for for our country know when it when things start opening up

1638
02:11:19.76 --> 02:11:22.48
So October 13 the

1639
02:11:23.52 --> 02:11:25.92
They'd done an assessment the Canadians and basically

1640
02:11:25.92 --> 02:11:30.80
It was costing them 20 million dollars a year to have the embassy open and the

1641
02:11:30.80 --> 02:11:34.48
Sort of assessment was there's a good mean no trade investment for about at least 15 years

1642
02:11:35.12 --> 02:11:38.24
So when we see a window of opportunity let's

1643
02:11:38.64 --> 02:11:42.64
Claps the embassy and leave but it couldn't just collapse them because the locals would be questioned

1644
02:11:43.92 --> 02:11:48.96
So fast forward now of summer 14 the triply war the Americans the Brits your talons

1645
02:11:48.96 --> 02:11:54.64
They just shot shot and went what the Canadians aren't going back so they had to shred everything and stay there

1646
02:11:54.64 --> 02:12:00.96
Their protection team was Canadian military and they would fly in every four months rotate

1647
02:12:01.52 --> 02:12:06.24
Flying to triple international airport but during their period of four months they never left

1648
02:12:06.96 --> 02:12:11.68
The wars of triply they just went from their accommodation to the office it didn't get out the city

1649
02:12:12.32 --> 02:12:18.16
So they didn't know what was beyond the city walls and it's actually only 100 kilometers coastal road from triply to tuners

1650
02:12:18.16 --> 02:12:25.84
So I flew in and we'd already evacuated a couple of people from USA and I did I don't go

1651
02:12:26.48 --> 02:12:31.12
With the big overt vehicle was like local taxis and just keep it all low profile and

1652
02:12:32.08 --> 02:12:38.56
The week before the British got engaged at every checkpoint on the way to to tuners which is obviously

1653
02:12:38.88 --> 02:12:42.08
Warri in the Canadians so me my fixer

1654
02:12:42.08 --> 02:12:49.44
We went out and we just rather speak into the guys who got the weapons we know identified who the tribal elders was

1655
02:12:50.08 --> 02:12:51.60
sat down with them

1656
02:12:51.60 --> 02:12:55.52
No shared bread, yeah coffee and it was actually all about communication

1657
02:12:55.84 --> 02:12:57.84
Shownham respect and

1658
02:12:58.24 --> 02:13:04.80
Yeah, the following following day day then escort it us safely so about 18 military and four diplomats

1659
02:13:05.12 --> 02:13:07.12
single handedly from

1660
02:13:07.12 --> 02:13:13.44
Tripley to to tuners yeah just to put that in perspective a little bit when I was a young seal before

1661
02:13:14.16 --> 02:13:15.76
before you know

1662
02:13:15.76 --> 02:13:17.76
September 11th

1663
02:13:17.76 --> 02:13:25.92
One of the main missions I did two deployments with the Marine Corps on ships and one of the main missions that we would train for is called a

1664
02:13:26.16 --> 02:13:31.60
Niel non-combatant evacuation operation which is literally to go into whatever

1665
02:13:31.60 --> 02:13:40.24
you know un-American embassy presumably and go in in some hostel or semi-hospital country and evacuate those people but they would have an

1666
02:13:40.56 --> 02:13:43.60
entire amphibious ready group with you know

1667
02:13:44.40 --> 02:13:51.44
Several battalions of Marines the air support the seals all to go and get whatever that group is out of the country

1668
02:13:51.44 --> 02:13:57.44
So when I was reading that portion of the book where you made this happen that's a that's a huge deal to do this

1669
02:13:57.44 --> 02:14:04.80
Essentially a mission that normally that could utilize an entire amphibious ready group with air frames and

1670
02:14:05.20 --> 02:14:08.56
ships and the whole nine yards to make this happen and you're able to do it

1671
02:14:09.52 --> 02:14:18.16
In a different from a different angle by utilizing the locals by having building relationships with the locals going and doing it low profile

1672
02:14:18.72 --> 02:14:24.16
That's just a it's a real credit to what the way you were thinking about that operation. Yeah, you have to think out the box

1673
02:14:24.16 --> 02:14:29.76
You know the fish wagons as fish wagons that take fish from tripply to tune is every day

1674
02:14:29.92 --> 02:14:33.84
So we used the fish wagons to put the equipment in because they would just go straight through

1675
02:14:34.48 --> 02:14:40.32
Border control there were a bit slow again to tune is that I can see the Canadians getting it getting a bit a bit worried

1676
02:14:40.64 --> 02:14:48.24
But yeah, it was just thinking thinking out the box we did have UAV coverage there was UAV coverage to the border and then when we're at the border

1677
02:14:48.24 --> 02:14:56.96
The Canadians and Matt but I did that job for free and the reason I did that was the year before I just finished

1678
02:14:56.96 --> 02:15:01.76
Yeah, well I'd be go ahead. It's it's it's an interesting perspective

1679
02:15:02.56 --> 02:15:10.000
You you you got yourself into a situation yeah that maybe didn't give the best image of what you were trying to do

1680
02:15:10.24 --> 02:15:16.16
Yeah, so my role with in the security and she I was very ad hoc you know when I got out a lot of my friends went over to work in the UAE

1681
02:15:16.16 --> 02:15:20.72
Train their military which is great good money and things out, but I wanted to learn more

1682
02:15:21.44 --> 02:15:22.48
You know

1683
02:15:22.48 --> 02:15:29.36
Outside that militia environment as well. I actually did more sensitive jobs as a private secure operative and I did when I was in the special forces

1684
02:15:29.52 --> 02:15:35.60
And you know I worked all over Africa Yemen you know every time I got a phone call it was a different country. It was a different job

1685
02:15:36.32 --> 02:15:37.92
and

1686
02:15:37.92 --> 02:15:43.12
I just come out with Yemen and I was in Dubai and I got a phone call from my friend

1687
02:15:43.12 --> 02:15:47.52
We just sat up in a new company London and he said can you be can you be in Libya tomorrow?

1688
02:15:47.52 --> 02:15:50.000
I said well I can't my my Viz is expired

1689
02:15:50.24 --> 02:15:54.16
Don't worry about that. This is a different call by the way. I did that quote earlier. Did you can you be

1690
02:15:54.56 --> 02:15:58.16
Can you be in Libya Libya tomorrow? This is another time that that happened. This is another time

1691
02:15:58.16 --> 02:16:02.56
Good this was what this is what you were doing. They once you got out of the military you're running these security events

1692
02:16:02.96 --> 02:16:08.72
You're providing security or doing assessments. You're doing evacuations and so this is another time when you got the call

1693
02:16:08.72 --> 02:16:16.32
Hey can you be in Libya tomorrow? Yeah can you be in Libya tomorrow and I was out well no because my Viz is expired and he said you don't need a Viz

1694
02:16:16.88 --> 02:16:21.36
I was at fine so we flew via Manchester flew straight in and I I got to the

1695
02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:26.24
I got to the airport terminal and it's young guy comes out to me so you missed the Dean

1696
02:16:26.24 --> 02:16:31.20
I said you heard Mr Dean so follow me so that everyone's in the queue for a passport and we went in another queue

1697
02:16:32.16 --> 02:16:36.08
And we went to took me into the city and went to the to Bestie Hotel

1698
02:16:36.08 --> 02:16:41.52
Which is part of the Crimfield hotel group. I knew that was owned by the Maltese and also by the governor

1699
02:16:42.08 --> 02:16:43.84
And one of the guys that he said right

1700
02:16:44.40 --> 02:16:50.96
Met my one of my partners there. My business partners and he said right you're just about to go meet the Prime Minister Libya

1701
02:16:50.96 --> 02:16:56.80
It speaks no English speaks German so the health minister's gonna translate as I get fined

1702
02:16:57.28 --> 02:17:04.08
So but but they're born on the back story about 48 hours before the militias had seized all the oil terminals to stop

1703
02:17:04.08 --> 02:17:11.28
Export and a boil in Libya and so we went upstairs and he sits down to explain this situation to me

1704
02:17:12.16 --> 02:17:15.84
And he says at one of what do we do and I said well

1705
02:17:16.88 --> 02:17:20.24
So what do you want he said I want I want terminals but the terminals back

1706
02:17:20.96 --> 02:17:27.04
I said look well we can we can pull a team together you know do four four simultaneous assaults

1707
02:17:27.04 --> 02:17:30.80
You know don't want to back to back you all your walnut four simple tennis assaults

1708
02:17:30.80 --> 02:17:34.32
I've ever from sea or from land but leave the flank open from to escape

1709
02:17:34.80 --> 02:17:38.40
Said no I don't want to misscape. I sort of looked over to my friend and

1710
02:17:39.92 --> 02:17:41.52
And he said this is being sanctioned

1711
02:17:41.52 --> 02:17:43.52
I'm not really so that okay

1712
02:17:43.52 --> 02:17:46.56
So let me just translate this for people that might not be tracking

1713
02:17:47.60 --> 02:17:49.28
So there's oil

1714
02:17:49.28 --> 02:17:53.28
Um rigs that have been seized the Prime Minister of

1715
02:17:53.60 --> 02:17:57.44
Libya is sitting there telling you I want these things back from these

1716
02:17:57.44 --> 02:18:02.88
Insurgents or whatever you want to call them I want these oil rigs back from these insurgents

1717
02:18:02.88 --> 02:18:07.36
I want you to do a simultaneous that where you said hey, I can do a simultaneous assault

1718
02:18:07.36 --> 02:18:10.88
Yeah, so you're gonna need a lot of people to do this and then you say listen

1719
02:18:10.88 --> 02:18:15.12
You know smart thing you're thinking hey, I'll give them a way to get out so that way they're not gonna stand and fight

1720
02:18:15.12 --> 02:18:18.000
Hopefully and you know will will mitigate damage

1721
02:18:18.88 --> 02:18:24.32
And he says no we don't want anyone to escape we want you to go and kill all these people that are on these oil rigs

1722
02:18:24.32 --> 02:18:29.28
And that's so that's the the mission tasking that you're getting okay

1723
02:18:29.28 --> 02:18:35.84
So that's the mission task and and full of listeners so basically in Libya Benghazi over in the east is where all the oil is and

1724
02:18:36.16 --> 02:18:41.36
The politicians rule in the west and again different tribes they do not get on well

1725
02:18:41.36 --> 02:18:45.68
So and then in the middle you got Mizrata as well and there's then so there's a big mess

1726
02:18:46.40 --> 02:18:48.40
So I walked out this meeting and on that

1727
02:18:48.40 --> 02:18:54.96
Right, I'm gonna need at least 150 guys, you know 50 tier one and 70 tier two and

1728
02:18:55.92 --> 02:18:59.28
This has been funded. He said it. Yeah, make it happen so

1729
02:18:59.92 --> 02:19:04.64
Straight away some like I'm having to make phone calls and I would love to see the invoice

1730
02:19:04.64 --> 02:19:11.20
I'm this that you're gonna see that but the and it was no the money we were getting for this job was

1731
02:19:11.44 --> 02:19:17.92
Four times your normal daily wage, you know and so I I had guys on standby in UK on like

1732
02:19:17.92 --> 02:19:21.68
Twice as much they're doing in Iraq and in Africa and just stay in the home

1733
02:19:22.08 --> 02:19:26.16
It was huge it started to grow into a beast and every evening

1734
02:19:26.16 --> 02:19:30.16
I would go up and speak to the Prime Minister update where we are in the situation and

1735
02:19:30.64 --> 02:19:36.72
And you know this went on for like two or three weeks the problem I had was some guys was starting to come in and

1736
02:19:36.72 --> 02:19:38.48
It was trying to hide them you know

1737
02:19:38.48 --> 02:19:44.40
It's keeping out of you because there was other Prime and security companies there who I knew I had a great reputation in in Libya

1738
02:19:44.40 --> 02:19:48.72
And they're like oh what you what you're doing Dean I'm not reviewing my evacuation plans

1739
02:19:48.72 --> 02:19:52.24
It was like you know the guys do look very special forces

1740
02:19:52.88 --> 02:19:55.84
So this went on for about three weeks and

1741
02:19:56.48 --> 02:19:58.48
But in all the planning in the place

1742
02:19:58.72 --> 02:20:04.000
Doing all our wreckies using his private jet in butterfly over the areas identifying you know

1743
02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:08.56
There's any aircraft we can utilize you know without the top of the the equipment list

1744
02:20:08.56 --> 02:20:11.60
We had kit coming in from like platter tank you know all over the world

1745
02:20:11.60 --> 02:20:14.24
And so yeah, it was a big invoice and

1746
02:20:14.96 --> 02:20:17.76
This evening I went up to the Prime Minister and he said look

1747
02:20:17.76 --> 02:20:19.28
So I need to go to

1748
02:20:19.28 --> 02:20:22.48
To New York tomorrow's the UN conference

1749
02:20:22.56 --> 02:20:26.64
But each evening please come up brief up the health minister. So it's fine

1750
02:20:27.28 --> 02:20:32.56
So the following evening I went upstairs and the health ministers in and so now the Prime Minister went to New York

1751
02:20:32.56 --> 02:20:36.000
He's in New York now and you're just along with the the health minister health minister

1752
02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:39.52
Who actually turns out to be not the health minister but a hospital manager from

1753
02:20:39.52 --> 02:20:43.92
London it's the only guy who could trust so it's very close doors

1754
02:20:43.92 --> 02:20:48.24
But in the in the corner over my left was a larger gentleman with a big bushy

1755
02:20:48.48 --> 02:20:53.04
Tash and he's just saying nothing so me and health minister a chat in a way next

1756
02:20:53.04 --> 02:20:57.60
He just starts screaming living they start arguing and living so I just pull my

1757
02:20:58.24 --> 02:21:00.88
Pull my chair back and let that's quiet down

1758
02:21:01.44 --> 02:21:04.80
I mean he just then started talking in the perfect English

1759
02:21:04.96 --> 02:21:07.20
He said who are you? I told him who are what?

1760
02:21:07.20 --> 02:21:10.48
He said what you're doing here and I'm explained and

1761
02:21:11.36 --> 02:21:15.52
He was the head of their SIS intelligence service and he said

1762
02:21:16.16 --> 02:21:21.28
No one knows this is happening in government you know he's going the Prime Minister's gone on their own back

1763
02:21:21.28 --> 02:21:25.20
That's okay and he said where are we with it? I said well this is the stage rat

1764
02:21:25.20 --> 02:21:28.40
You know one or two more weeks and we read it ago and he's not

1765
02:21:28.96 --> 02:21:35.12
So I'm not saying stop it but can we slow it down? I'm thinking we're the daily wage we're on the slowdown as much you want

1766
02:21:35.12 --> 02:21:37.12
And I said yeah, of course

1767
02:21:37.12 --> 02:21:43.52
So yeah, I said well look I tell you what we're doing is why not we design a special forces training program for

1768
02:21:44.000 --> 02:21:47.76
Libions in the West and the Libions in East because they were never trained together

1769
02:21:48.16 --> 02:21:50.16
That way it would be

1770
02:21:50.16 --> 02:21:55.60
Covered the reason why this equipment coming in it would justify what it's guys coming in so it's we went to an agreement on that

1771
02:21:55.60 --> 02:21:57.20
He's the one pay what he is

1772
02:21:57.20 --> 02:21:58.40
He's right

1773
02:21:58.40 --> 02:22:00.40
Right, so

1774
02:22:00.40 --> 02:22:02.40
So that's what we did

1775
02:22:02.40 --> 02:22:07.76
Anyway, the you know the government paying it was a third part you I can't mention it was paying for this and about we lay it as it looked

1776
02:22:08.32 --> 02:22:10.32
You know we are safe and come on here

1777
02:22:10.32 --> 02:22:12.32
And let's call it a day

1778
02:22:12.32 --> 02:22:17.04
Could we can pick this up any time we can come back and pick it. I'll just said yeah, perfect. Let's do that

1779
02:22:17.52 --> 02:22:21.68
So I sent a start sending the guide back and one of my best friends he stayed out with me

1780
02:22:21.68 --> 02:22:23.68
I said let we'll go back tomorrow

1781
02:22:23.92 --> 02:22:25.92
That evening we're in the

1782
02:22:26.08 --> 02:22:31.52
There's a restaurant at the top of hotel nice Moroccan open air restaurant and we could hear

1783
02:22:31.52 --> 02:22:34.48
A distinct sound of an AC-1-3

1784
02:22:35.20 --> 02:22:38.64
You know what a hurtly's aircraft sound is like distinct and we're like that

1785
02:22:39.20 --> 02:22:40.40
That's a hook

1786
02:22:40.40 --> 02:22:45.04
But there was four AC-1-4 is at Milita, military airport around the corner

1787
02:22:45.28 --> 02:22:49.12
But they were grounded they didn't work could already done the rec on them see if we could utilize them

1788
02:22:50.08 --> 02:22:51.28
Fort enough in of it

1789
02:22:51.76 --> 02:22:58.48
Anyway the next morning all over the world news dealt force had come in and picked up an a Q guy responsible for the cans

1790
02:22:58.72 --> 02:23:00.72
Kenyan tans in air bombings

1791
02:23:00.72 --> 02:23:06.88
So obviously the prime minister when you got into your an a dinner agreement for the Americans given it the green light

1792
02:23:06.88 --> 02:23:08.08
Which is fine

1793
02:23:08.08 --> 02:23:09.76
But of course everyone thought that was me

1794
02:23:10.16 --> 02:23:13.84
You know me and my mate trying to get out the airport that day was difficult

1795
02:23:14.16 --> 02:23:18.24
Because and obviously explaining to the other security companies as well that wasn't me

1796
02:23:19.12 --> 02:23:21.12
We got out

1797
02:23:21.12 --> 02:23:25.28
The prime minister got back about three days later. He got arrested by the militias

1798
02:23:25.52 --> 02:23:29.12
He got released in the end again people thought I was responsible for that

1799
02:23:29.12 --> 02:23:33.44
I wasn't so I kept a low profile for about a couple of weeks and I flew black back in and

1800
02:23:34.08 --> 02:23:38.16
I was winning contracts. I was getting some good contracts, but I wasn't getting

1801
02:23:38.96 --> 02:23:43.12
Your oil and gas your NGOs. I wasn't getting the big ones and I met a friend who's an excess

1802
02:23:43.12 --> 02:23:46.08
It's guy who's a security advisor for PMC

1803
02:23:47.12 --> 02:23:48.32
And

1804
02:23:48.32 --> 02:23:50.32
Also PWC and he says

1805
02:23:50.96 --> 02:23:53.60
He says stop everyone thinks you're you're a mercenary

1806
02:23:53.92 --> 02:23:54.96
You're

1807
02:23:54.96 --> 02:23:58.72
We're not mercenary. I see it with sanctioned by the various governments

1808
02:23:58.72 --> 02:24:02.88
It was actually a show of thought how quickly we could pull a private team together

1809
02:24:03.44 --> 02:24:04.88
He said yeah, we know that

1810
02:24:04.88 --> 02:24:06.80
I said but for the general you know

1811
02:24:06.80 --> 02:24:10.40
Algorithm corporations you do their diligence. They they don't see it like that

1812
02:24:10.96 --> 02:24:13.44
So then when it came to the Canadian embassy

1813
02:24:14.32 --> 02:24:17.76
Everyone had gone no security companies were gonna come back in and help the Canadians

1814
02:24:17.76 --> 02:24:20.32
So when I came in they said what was the cost?

1815
02:24:20.32 --> 02:24:24.32
And I said I think it was about $7,000 and that was to cover the fish wagons

1816
02:24:24.32 --> 02:24:30.08
My fixer and I charged enough in and then I walked in no everyone's at you could have made

1817
02:24:30.64 --> 02:24:33.04
But for me it was actually then brushed off

1818
02:24:33.76 --> 02:24:38.32
That reputation have been immersive and then put my name on the top of the pile has been the number one

1819
02:24:38.32 --> 02:24:40.32
Did that up for $7,000?

1820
02:24:40.64 --> 02:24:41.92
$7,000 we've got

1821
02:24:41.92 --> 02:24:44.96
$24,000 so a 22 people whole embassy

1822
02:24:45.68 --> 02:24:47.68
Hopefully that's ridiculous

1823
02:24:49.36 --> 02:24:51.36
My wife you should have charged

1824
02:24:51.36 --> 02:24:56.24
You could have kept your rate reputation or we're earned back your reputation and at least

1825
02:24:56.24 --> 02:24:59.52
I ain't a little money on the fact but for me it's all about you know

1826
02:24:59.52 --> 02:25:05.28
It wasn't in money. I liked like to help people and that's what I wanted to get across and is the fact and yeah

1827
02:25:05.28 --> 02:25:09.92
Did you know so then we came number one in industry yeah, yeah, so it's a strategic move

1828
02:25:09.92 --> 02:25:17.12
Obviously to do that and take care of those people and and give them a good deal and and clean your reputation up after it

1829
02:25:17.12 --> 02:25:24.16
Been a little bit you know tarnished by this involvement and and you know you go into some details on the book on that about just just the fact that

1830
02:25:25.44 --> 02:25:31.52
You know you can be sitting there talking to the actual prime minister of the country at the time and

1831
02:25:32.08 --> 02:25:34.08
It's not what it looks like

1832
02:25:36.08 --> 02:25:42.64
I'm out of backup a little bit this one part in the book you're talking about your new normal and this is what you're doing

1833
02:25:42.64 --> 02:25:46.24
Your dad had been diagnosed with cancer

1834
02:25:47.04 --> 02:25:52.48
You drove to the hospital when you got to the hospital your sisters are there your step moms there

1835
02:25:52.96 --> 02:25:57.60
They'd been there kind of kind of just toiling with the whole situation

1836
02:25:58.32 --> 02:26:02.56
You show up and put them on rotation like hey, I'm going home. I'll be back in the morning

1837
02:26:03.44 --> 02:26:08.40
You know you need to get some sleep because they were out there at the edge and then you come back

1838
02:26:08.40 --> 02:26:14.16
Um, and you go into this the next eight hours was probably the longest continuous amount of time

1839
02:26:14.16 --> 02:26:17.04
They we had ever spent together. This is with your dad in the hospital

1840
02:26:17.44 --> 02:26:21.84
He's in rough shape. We had a bit of a chat, but it was superficial. He was on pain killers

1841
02:26:22.56 --> 02:26:26.16
But that had never been our style anyways. I knew I loved him

1842
02:26:26.80 --> 02:26:32.48
He knew I loved him and I knew he loved me anything else I can do for you. I asked him. He told me I had a pain in his leg

1843
02:26:32.48 --> 02:26:39.04
I saw he had a problem with one of his pain relief devices. I took a couple of seconds to fix it and instantly

1844
02:26:39.28 --> 02:26:43.20
He looks to read and nodded off to sleep when the girls returned that evening

1845
02:26:43.52 --> 02:26:47.76
He was still peaceful. I've never seen him look so calm my step mom said

1846
02:26:48.32 --> 02:26:52.16
Well, that's because he hasn't got three women fussing over a misnet. I joke to every squad

1847
02:26:52.16 --> 02:26:54.64
He knows that dark humor is how you cope with death

1848
02:26:55.76 --> 02:27:00.40
I stood up and gave my dad a pat on the shoulder when we would be back when will you be back?

1849
02:27:00.40 --> 02:27:04.72
One of my sisters asked me. I shook my head. I won't I'm going back to Aberdeen

1850
02:27:05.28 --> 02:27:11.76
They couldn't believe it. I've said my goodbyes. I told them and my family are up in Aberdeen. That's where I need to be

1851
02:27:12.24 --> 02:27:15.68
I knew it would be the last time that I saw them and I was at peace with that

1852
02:27:16.24 --> 02:27:20.000
Back in Aberdeen that night I got news that I had been expecting

1853
02:27:20.72 --> 02:27:23.60
How's your dad doing? Allana asked me the next day at breakfast?

1854
02:27:24.08 --> 02:27:29.76
He died last night. I replied and went back to eating my cereal. I was that blase about the whole thing

1855
02:27:29.76 --> 02:27:33.28
I didn't realize it then but death had been normalized for me

1856
02:27:34.000 --> 02:27:37.92
So two at my ways of coping with it a complete numbing of my emotions

1857
02:27:38.48 --> 02:27:43.92
My father had passed away and I'd given my wife the news in the same way that I'd tell her that the kettle had just boiled

1858
02:27:44.56 --> 02:27:50.64
Over the next week or so I took control of the practical side of my dad's death. I helped arrange the funeral and made

1859
02:27:50.80 --> 02:27:54.32
Contact with the royal engineers associations that they could be present

1860
02:27:54.32 --> 02:28:00.24
I wore my lavats one of the ceremonial uniforms of the Royal Marines and the SPS

1861
02:28:00.32 --> 02:28:03.28
I wore my green beret my medals and my fathers

1862
02:28:03.36 --> 02:28:07.52
It was the last time that I wore the uniform and I suppose that it was a truth

1863
02:28:08.88 --> 02:28:15.52
Fitting tribute in itself my dad had been a huge part of me beginning in the my military journey and now

1864
02:28:16.40 --> 02:28:18.40
He was part of its end

1865
02:28:18.40 --> 02:28:20.88
How are you feeling? A lot of asked me after the funeral?

1866
02:28:20.88 --> 02:28:26.80
I need to leave the house at 0600 hours tomorrow to get to the airport. I told her and reply

1867
02:28:27.92 --> 02:28:34.16
In a moment when most people are racked by emotion I was print planning my travel for the job in South Africa

1868
02:28:34.72 --> 02:28:39.12
I was relentless but in pursuit of what and why

1869
02:28:44.88 --> 02:28:46.40
Now

1870
02:28:46.64 --> 02:28:48.64
Obviously you know it's uh something that

1871
02:28:48.64 --> 02:28:53.44
You know we we have to deal with death on a big way and in

1872
02:28:54.32 --> 02:28:56.72
Especially when with with people that

1873
02:28:57.60 --> 02:29:00.72
You know I don't know how old your dad was when he died but

1874
02:29:01.36 --> 02:29:02.72
67

1875
02:29:02.72 --> 02:29:08.96
Had to had a grown son and and and kids and had lived his life and you know I know for me

1876
02:29:10.000 --> 02:29:13.84
You know for us it's hard because we see we see our friends that died that are

1877
02:29:13.84 --> 02:29:22.08
2732 you know they they haven't had that opportunity and I think that's something that makes a little sense of my head of

1878
02:29:22.48 --> 02:29:31.20
When someone older dies of course it's sad but you know that they had a good life and they had that opportunity and then like you said you know

1879
02:29:32.64 --> 02:29:38.64
We we unfortunately have to see a lot of people dying you have to figure out how to get through that

1880
02:29:39.44 --> 02:29:41.44
And sometimes maybe it's not the

1881
02:29:41.44 --> 02:29:46.48
Well sometimes I guess we take the emotional side of it and and have to stay for a down

1882
02:29:47.44 --> 02:29:50.16
Maybe not the best thing to do but it's kind of what we do yeah

1883
02:29:50.96 --> 02:29:52.72
So what is that we deal with things that

1884
02:29:52.72 --> 02:29:56.08
That we my my father you know when I join the army

1885
02:29:56.72 --> 02:30:02.000
That was it that was my new family one of my sisters stayed with my my dad and my other sister went up to a mum

1886
02:30:02.000 --> 02:30:06.16
So they they had their own life so when I joined the army that was it that was my family you know

1887
02:30:06.16 --> 02:30:10.000
I would only get in touch my dad was at old school you know me and he

1888
02:30:10.000 --> 02:30:15.04
I remember getting a phone call is that you got to ring your dad about really you know and it was because of my cousin

1889
02:30:15.04 --> 02:30:18.000
The come over from Australia he would only ring if it was really really important

1890
02:30:18.40 --> 02:30:21.60
So I would do my normal birthdays and Christmas and that was enough

1891
02:30:21.84 --> 02:30:28.64
No news was good news in my family my dad sort of knew to score he would know about me coming back from a toy

1892
02:30:28.64 --> 02:30:33.36
I wouldn't tell him when I was going so we we had that that relationship so I you know

1893
02:30:33.44 --> 02:30:35.44
We weren't close close

1894
02:30:35.44 --> 02:30:41.60
But I think it was just after Christmas well we knew he'd been diagnosed and it was terminal and things that and my sister

1895
02:30:42.16 --> 02:30:44.72
Said you need to come down you need to come down and yeah, I know

1896
02:30:45.28 --> 02:30:49.52
That she was being a bit over reactive and then her husband rang me I said you know need to come down

1897
02:30:49.52 --> 02:30:54.96
So I said yeah, I'll come down and I went in there and literally they're all watching is every breath

1898
02:30:54.96 --> 02:30:59.12
You know there are eyes were like piss holes in the snow they had no sleep like 24 hours

1899
02:30:59.60 --> 02:31:01.60
So I just flown in I hadn't seen them for months

1900
02:31:01.60 --> 02:31:07.84
I said right I'm just off to my friends out and that what I said because you know you guys tomorrow

1901
02:31:07.84 --> 02:31:09.52
It will be useless you know

1902
02:31:09.52 --> 02:31:14.24
I mean I just the military just kicked in you know, we need to do centuries when he did routines and

1903
02:31:14.96 --> 02:31:20.08
I remember my mum calling me from Manchester team you need to come down. It's like you know

1904
02:31:20.72 --> 02:31:23.52
They're upset you deal with

1905
02:31:23.76 --> 02:31:28.16
Definitely they're they're they're they do but like I said that eight hours I had with my dad

1906
02:31:28.16 --> 02:31:32.32
You know that was the longest I had and you know for me I'd I'd said my goodbyes and

1907
02:31:33.20 --> 02:31:35.20
Yeah, I just I just went a bit

1908
02:31:35.92 --> 02:31:41.84
That was 2014 it was the same year that evacuated the Canadian embassy when I came back from that trip

1909
02:31:41.84 --> 02:31:47.20
I did the same thing again. I sat down and my normal SOP would be to you know

1910
02:31:47.20 --> 02:31:50.40
De-service and resurface my kit ready for the next phone call and

1911
02:31:51.12 --> 02:31:53.44
One of my shirts was was covered in blood

1912
02:31:53.44 --> 02:31:59.76
I'd had minutes the first aid at traffic accident at the border so I said to my wife

1913
02:31:59.76 --> 02:32:02.48
I said can we get the blood out which could yeah

1914
02:32:02.48 --> 02:32:07.28
I'm one and oh my this blood in there and I sort of subloved just evacuated Canadian embassy

1915
02:32:07.28 --> 02:32:11.44
She's like it's like there's another flowway coming like you told me your dad just died

1916
02:32:12.24 --> 02:32:16.16
So actually we sat down at evening down two balls of port and

1917
02:32:16.72 --> 02:32:23.36
Yeah tears started flowing and really and what it was is actually I hadn't come to terms with the fact that I didn't

1918
02:32:23.36 --> 02:32:28.96
Left the special forces. I was still trying to match that adrenaline rush that I had when I was still in

1919
02:32:29.28 --> 02:32:31.04
So everything even

1920
02:32:31.04 --> 02:32:34.40
Approaching the further my father had died that hadn't hadn't sunk in

1921
02:32:35.04 --> 02:32:38.80
So as you mentioned early and it takes a whole brigade evacuated so you know

1922
02:32:38.96 --> 02:32:42.96
I didn't have that top cover. I didn't have the helo support that the guys come in

1923
02:32:42.96 --> 02:32:47.52
So that's when the the pin drop for me that something needs to change

1924
02:32:47.52 --> 02:32:52.72
And it was actually all about communication and I had I'd built it up inside me and it was that evening

1925
02:32:53.36 --> 02:32:57.60
That it really kicked in that your dad's not here. You don't have to prove a point

1926
02:32:58.88 --> 02:33:03.52
anymore, so yeah, it was a big I think it's cool the chat school dead or divorced as well

1927
02:33:04.24 --> 02:33:10.40
So you know I'd reached that tea junction. I was either gonna die or not have a family if I didn't change the way my life star

1928
02:33:11.36 --> 02:33:15.84
You um one of the things that you you breeze the over us when you when you did the world cup and Brazil

1929
02:33:15.84 --> 02:33:17.84
and

1930
02:33:18.72 --> 02:33:24.72
I'll just jump into it. It was at the Brazil versus Cameroon game that I got a chance to catch up with a friend of mine

1931
02:33:24.72 --> 02:33:28.32
He was there representing the football association because his brother couldn't make it

1932
02:33:28.56 --> 02:33:36.08
Happy that my clients were secure with the other lads. I left my place and went to the presidential box to meet my mate from the army

1933
02:33:37.12 --> 02:33:39.12
All right, Stati he said

1934
02:33:39.12 --> 02:33:45.36
How are you mate? I asked him we'd met back in 2007 at a joint tactical air controller

1935
02:33:46.40 --> 02:33:50.64
Sorry joint terminal attack control or jacorce held at RAF

1936
02:33:50.88 --> 02:33:58.96
Leaming there were 18 students and when we've been told to behave towards a certain individual as we would to anybody else in the forces

1937
02:33:59.52 --> 02:34:00.88
No special treatment

1938
02:34:00.88 --> 02:34:03.52
It was on the second day that we hit it off when we were

1939
02:34:03.52 --> 02:34:09.68
Being given our call signs from the back of the room. I'd made a joke at his expense and there was a sharp

1940
02:34:10.08 --> 02:34:15.04
Inhalation of breath as everybody waited to see how it would look or see how he would see how he took it

1941
02:34:16.000 --> 02:34:21.52
He laughed and that was how I came to be paired up for the rest of the course with Prince Harry

1942
02:34:21.52 --> 02:34:27.28
Who was one of the most decent blocs you could meet he's a military man through and through and I think part of the reason

1943
02:34:27.28 --> 02:34:29.68
He loved the army so much was that he could just be himself

1944
02:34:29.68 --> 02:34:35.76
He was comfortable in this environment and he could handle his rank and job as well as any other soldier

1945
02:34:35.76 --> 02:34:38.08
I'd met it was great to see him in Brazil

1946
02:34:38.08 --> 02:34:43.68
Not because he was a prince but because he was a comrade from my days in kit just like one of the boys

1947
02:34:45.52 --> 02:34:47.52
How long was that course?

1948
02:34:47.52 --> 02:34:51.68
That's it has six week course so this we're going back now to 2007 and

1949
02:34:52.24 --> 02:34:54.24
You know, RF Leaming

1950
02:34:54.24 --> 02:35:02.16
You know, you're tornados and you're your fighters you know with their brown shoes probably and the

1951
02:35:03.44 --> 02:35:08.56
And let's see that Ariv Lee the J attack course is a wooden hut at the end of the runway

1952
02:35:08.56 --> 02:35:10.24
You know, no one even knows were there

1953
02:35:10.24 --> 02:35:15.44
So I remember walking in the room and clocking him. He's probably about 23 so basically this is when he

1954
02:35:16.16 --> 02:35:18.32
He wanted to go on his first tour to Afghanistan

1955
02:35:18.32 --> 02:35:20.72
But he couldn't just go on tour

1956
02:35:20.72 --> 02:35:25.28
You know, he had to have a role within the unit and his command and officers in SES guidance

1957
02:35:25.28 --> 02:35:26.24
So we'll look

1958
02:35:26.24 --> 02:35:29.60
Go on your J attack course you could be the regiment or forward air control

1959
02:35:30.16 --> 02:35:32.24
So that's what he did he came on the course and

1960
02:35:32.80 --> 02:35:37.28
Like I say could he was there you know every man in his dog turned up for some face time with him and

1961
02:35:37.68 --> 02:35:44.32
You know, it was it was cringing but the back for the the the lads at the back for in the back were two SES and two SPS guys

1962
02:35:45.20 --> 02:35:49.92
And he was literally certain front of me and you know everyone did the they're open in the dress

1963
02:35:49.92 --> 02:35:52.56
Harry then left the room and then they're coming down as like right

1964
02:35:53.04 --> 02:35:56.64
Get's no preferential treatment, you know, treat him like one in their own you know

1965
02:35:57.44 --> 02:35:58.88
Baba, but that's fine

1966
02:35:58.88 --> 02:36:02.08
Harry then comes back in and the first lecture is cool signs

1967
02:36:02.08 --> 02:36:06.24
So on the course you call jackpot one to jackpot one eight so at least the pilot knows

1968
02:36:06.80 --> 02:36:12.64
Who the student is and then you know for example the prefix for special boat service is mayhem some mayhem for free

1969
02:36:13.20 --> 02:36:17.44
And you know widow maker for the SES so Harry puts his hand up and he says

1970
02:36:17.44 --> 02:36:19.84
You know if successful on this course

1971
02:36:20.32 --> 02:36:26.16
To get a cool sign and I just blew it out. Yeah, you're fox piss one like that and of course everyone was just that

1972
02:36:27.04 --> 02:36:30.64
You know you can't say that I'm just that well you've just told me to treat him like the one

1973
02:36:30.64 --> 02:36:33.36
So he turns over you know looks at the very smiles at me

1974
02:36:33.36 --> 02:36:34.64
Oh god

1975
02:36:34.64 --> 02:36:36.64
I'm gonna get beheaded

1976
02:36:37.36 --> 02:36:38.08
And

1977
02:36:38.08 --> 02:36:43.28
That afternoon the sergeant mays it comes back in and he's right I've randomly picked these jackpot numbers

1978
02:36:43.28 --> 02:36:50.56
He working with me any people the an SES guy an SPS guy Prince Harry and an RAF officer

1979
02:36:50.88 --> 02:36:53.36
And then the other 14 which didn't make sense

1980
02:36:53.36 --> 02:36:55.36
Well with it, I was that way you've randomly picked those

1981
02:36:56.000 --> 02:36:57.36
But you could see

1982
02:36:57.68 --> 02:37:01.36
On the course that was when I got my sort of first exposure so me and him got pounded off

1983
02:37:01.36 --> 02:37:04.24
Because they knew he wasn't gonna get any preference to human and I think

1984
02:37:04.80 --> 02:37:07.60
You made that quick. I mean that quite clear but also the fact that he

1985
02:37:08.16 --> 02:37:12.96
He's probably is most comfortable there because he wasn't being critiqued by the media and

1986
02:37:12.96 --> 02:37:18.56
Everyone else he could be Harry could be you know left ten and where wasn't things like that and he was actually a good

1987
02:37:18.56 --> 02:37:21.76
Operate you know he's clear and precise over the net. He didn't get flustered

1988
02:37:22.56 --> 02:37:28.96
So you know he's well worthy of that role and and then we maintain that relationship after that

1989
02:37:28.96 --> 02:37:34.40
We you know we did a lot together. We do a lot in in charity and I remember

1990
02:37:35.36 --> 02:37:38.80
Going to we had a big rugby game called the army navy each year

1991
02:37:38.80 --> 02:37:43.52
Twicken him it's like it's the biggest rugby event in 150,000 people turn off

1992
02:37:43.52 --> 02:37:48.16
Yeah, yeah, they drink more alcohol on that one weekend than every international rugby

1993
02:37:48.72 --> 02:37:50.32
So he was is my wife

1994
02:37:51.04 --> 02:37:56.32
Alana she didn't really know I knew him and I not long been injured so my legs in a brace and right to

1995
02:37:56.32 --> 02:37:58.16
Iknow and I

1996
02:37:58.56 --> 02:38:02.16
He takes me so let's catch up in a car park so a caught up in a car park and this was

1997
02:38:02.16 --> 02:38:08.40
This was now ready is training to be a pilot and you know we we started chatting and he said look

1998
02:38:09.12 --> 02:38:15.04
Pass my course I need to make a decision you know where I fly Apache or links and links is like

1999
02:38:15.76 --> 02:38:18.24
Glorify taxi driver for genals round and

2000
02:38:19.60 --> 02:38:25.04
When we're chatting to the the Apache course signs in afghan they're prefects is ugly no ugly one ugly too

2001
02:38:25.68 --> 02:38:27.68
So I said look I was tell the lads go ugly early

2002
02:38:27.68 --> 02:38:34.80
And so he that he then messes me a few days later and said yeah, I'm going ugly so he then goes a patchy

2003
02:38:35.68 --> 02:38:40.96
Fast forward and we're at a big special forces charity event and he's he's a guest on my table

2004
02:38:41.68 --> 02:38:44.32
And they auctioned off his special boat service like

2005
02:38:45.04 --> 02:38:49.44
Statue silver plated with like 40,000 pounds and Harry's out of beautiful

2006
02:38:49.44 --> 02:38:53.68
I was not for 40 grandness. I knew I knew the bronze one was only 75 pounds

2007
02:38:53.68 --> 02:38:58.56
You know so I did I I bought one and I got it

2008
02:39:00.32 --> 02:39:03.68
I got it laminate and I said you know Harry said

2009
02:39:04.32 --> 02:39:10.16
Congratulations on being ugly now mayhem for free. I got it delivered to the palace but yeah

2010
02:39:10.16 --> 02:39:13.76
He you know he did 10 years and he ended another tour you know

2011
02:39:14.08 --> 02:39:19.76
That was where he was he was most comfortable and that's when we started you know building our relationship you know

2012
02:39:19.76 --> 02:39:27.68
So the read you know is this you it's got me so tight who people he can trust and and to be part at

2013
02:39:27.92 --> 02:39:32.72
13 years later is a bit thing. I mean he knows obviously the integrity of the special forces you know

2014
02:39:33.44 --> 02:39:36.80
No people I get messages all the time can you speak the Harry and yeah

2015
02:39:38.24 --> 02:39:40.24
Dilly

2016
02:39:41.52 --> 02:39:45.84
Yeah, that's I just I wonder kissie he's gonna end up playing a role little later. He is yeah

2017
02:39:45.84 --> 02:39:50.88
Um but going back to the dead or divorced section of this book

2018
02:39:51.84 --> 02:39:53.84
So you pretty much

2019
02:39:53.84 --> 02:39:57.12
You get the message like I mean they're gonna get divorced or I'm gonna be dead

2020
02:39:57.36 --> 02:40:02.56
I don't like either one of those outcomes so you you you kind of stand down from the security stuff and

2021
02:40:03.44 --> 02:40:05.44
You're got to get a job

2022
02:40:05.44 --> 02:40:10.48
Like a regular job. So we're going to the book here. I needed a job and a lot of suggested that come work with her in

2023
02:40:10.48 --> 02:40:16.32
In the property development sector it would be a chance for me to learn about something outside kicking indoors and

2024
02:40:16.40 --> 02:40:20.72
Sneaking people out of countries and because I wanted what was best my family. I gave it a go

2025
02:40:21.52 --> 02:40:27.28
I was about an hour into it before I started to fantasize about launching myself out of the nearest window

2026
02:40:27.68 --> 02:40:32.64
Everything that I'd done in my life I had done with the ethos of unrelenting pursuit pursuit of excellence

2027
02:40:32.96 --> 02:40:38.16
The unrelenting pursuit of excellence and I tried to bring that attitude into the office

2028
02:40:38.16 --> 02:40:44.64
But something was missing and you spend some time doing that and and

2029
02:40:45.84 --> 02:40:50.08
Then she can tell like your miserable yeah and you're trying to suck it up like a good

2030
02:40:50.48 --> 02:40:52.08
Like a good man and

2031
02:40:52.72 --> 02:40:55.60
Finally she says you know you look miserable and you're like yeah

2032
02:40:55.60 --> 02:40:59.20
I am and she says why don't you want to start biking to the office start cycling to the office

2033
02:40:59.84 --> 02:41:02.08
And it's 10 miles each way you start doing that

2034
02:41:03.04 --> 02:41:06.96
You're starting to that's cool. I hate you're starting to get you're starting to get after it

2035
02:41:06.96 --> 02:41:13.28
You know on the bike and try to beat your times and all that and she says you know basically you're still not happy

2036
02:41:13.28 --> 02:41:14.88
Are you and

2037
02:41:14.88 --> 02:41:20.40
You admit to her like no I don't like sitting in a cubicle or whatever is you're doing and finally one day

2038
02:41:20.40 --> 02:41:24.32
She she rolls in on you and you know she's holding something what's that?

2039
02:41:24.32 --> 02:41:28.000
I asked her she had a book in her hands a big one along the threw that me

2040
02:41:28.48 --> 02:41:33.12
Read it and pick something she said I look down at what had landed in my lap

2041
02:41:33.12 --> 02:41:39.84
She knew me I smiled open to the cover and began reading Guinness book of worlds record

2042
02:41:40.40 --> 02:41:44.88
Records so that's what she did she knew the book you and said figure out what figure out something to do

2043
02:41:45.04 --> 02:41:49.28
Yeah, yeah, so so a bit about a learner actually you know when when I transition

2044
02:41:49.28 --> 02:41:54.72
You hear horror stories when people are transition from the military some can be quite turbulent and some quite smooth

2045
02:41:54.72 --> 02:41:59.12
So when I met a learner as she was a bank manager for all the free the biggest banks in Aberdeen

2046
02:41:59.12 --> 02:42:05.52
So when I'm worried about you know certain people she set my first security company on a phone watching TV

2047
02:42:05.52 --> 02:42:10.16
And I'm not for me is like whether I've ticked the right box so she she knew about the corporate side

2048
02:42:10.40 --> 02:42:14.56
Which helped my transition and and it is a massive part in in moving forward

2049
02:42:15.12 --> 02:42:18.40
So when I came back from the Canadian MC the dead of divorcing

2050
02:42:18.40 --> 02:42:22.72
It was actually she thought I wanted to go away and I thought that she needs me go away to make money

2051
02:42:22.72 --> 02:42:24.88
So it was actually a lack of communication

2052
02:42:24.88 --> 02:42:29.60
You know we sat down it saw communicate and she said well look we don't need money. I've got my own

2053
02:42:30.08 --> 02:42:33.20
Property business you know come come wherever me. So I said fine

2054
02:42:33.76 --> 02:42:34.80
So

2055
02:42:34.80 --> 02:42:40.24
This is about five years now from leaving the military to this stage of my life my engine leg was now two kilos lighter

2056
02:42:40.32 --> 02:42:44.08
But my good leg because of the muscle wasted so when I was away on these security jobs

2057
02:42:44.48 --> 02:42:50.32
If there was a gym there I took my TRX everywhere you know it was a very upper body focus and it wasn't neglected my CV

2058
02:42:51.28 --> 02:42:53.28
So I just bought a push bike

2059
02:42:53.28 --> 02:42:56.08
Sorry got him looking echo about that

2060
02:42:56.64 --> 02:43:00.16
These skipping leg days growing score. I just worried about those guns

2061
02:43:02.56 --> 02:43:07.92
So I so I bought push bike or vammers and you know important Batman lycra thinking it was cool

2062
02:43:07.92 --> 02:43:11.12
It wasn't um but I didn't know anything about cycling

2063
02:43:11.12 --> 02:43:14.96
I but straight away just it's only about eight miles a mile about but being physically active

2064
02:43:14.96 --> 02:43:20.16
And you know you felt there was a big way off your shoulders. You know I can't run anymore and then I just thought perfect

2065
02:43:20.16 --> 02:43:24.48
But you know when my back story sat in his architects and planners meetings or that

2066
02:43:25.04 --> 02:43:27.52
No interest in these drawings and you know me

2067
02:43:28.32 --> 02:43:34.000
My wife could see the glaze over my eyes you know I was a morning yesterday in the coffee in the biscuits actually

2068
02:43:34.40 --> 02:43:39.52
When my son was born I was a one-hole in the baby feeling feeding the baby well she was doing all the work

2069
02:43:39.84 --> 02:43:41.12
You just felt like

2070
02:43:41.12 --> 02:43:46.40
You know is this it is all I've got to offer now. I didn't want to be taking those risks that I did before

2071
02:43:46.40 --> 02:43:52.80
So I was about a month before my 40th birthday and I was getting ground middle age Christy ground rush

2072
02:43:52.80 --> 02:43:56.88
And I was always remember doing all in memory then Guinness book records so

2073
02:43:57.28 --> 02:43:58.80
You know I was thinking

2074
02:43:58.80 --> 02:44:03.76
Cycling because it's not impacting my knee you know maybe I should have etts well for era rushes in a minute or something

2075
02:44:03.76 --> 02:44:06.40
It's something a bit easier but living in Scotland

2076
02:44:06.80 --> 02:44:10.000
I was thinking maybe you know maybe Aberdeen to Dundee about 60 miles

2077
02:44:10.56 --> 02:44:15.92
My wife and found the world's longest road just like from southern Argentina to northern Alaska

2078
02:44:15.92 --> 02:44:19.92
So I was a joke that she clearly wanted me out the house. I was like

2079
02:44:20.96 --> 02:44:26.40
So it's like it's it's it has 14,000 miles it's called the Pan American Highway

2080
02:44:26.40 --> 02:44:32.56
Well the Pan American Highway yeah so you know to give it an idea because of the curvature of the earth

2081
02:44:32.56 --> 02:44:37.52
It's just the equivalent of the cycling from London to Sydney and then another 4,000 miles

2082
02:44:37.52 --> 02:44:43.60
It's that big you know 22 so I thought perfect you know so having only Cycle less than 20 miles

2083
02:44:43.60 --> 02:44:46.80
I applied for the world record which no some people think it's quite arrogant

2084
02:44:47.92 --> 02:44:50.96
But I thought in my head I said well no I I have that endurance

2085
02:44:51.68 --> 02:44:56.88
Mindset if the knees not gonna be an issue then then why not why can't I do that?

2086
02:44:57.28 --> 02:45:01.68
So I applied for the world record will record was 125 days at this point

2087
02:45:01.68 --> 02:45:06.56
I mean six weeks later Guinness came back and said yes you've been successful on your application

2088
02:45:06.56 --> 02:45:12.80
During this period someone else has already beaten the world record it's now 117 days that's not great

2089
02:45:12.80 --> 02:45:15.44
So it already have to take eight days off my original plan

2090
02:45:16.40 --> 02:45:22.40
So we mentioned Harry or Eddie which is perfect rolls into this so Harry and I you know we do a lot in charity stuff

2091
02:45:22.40 --> 02:45:24.40
You know he's the common on my table

2092
02:45:24.40 --> 02:45:29.04
I had an intelligence fusion cell based in Mozambique in Tanzania

2093
02:45:29.04 --> 02:45:34.48
So you know these guys would give me in reports of where the ivory was going from Africa

2094
02:45:34.48 --> 02:45:40.64
You know to the far east you know so I would be obviously pushing this information up the line the Harry who then began out

2095
02:45:40.64 --> 02:45:45.84
So we're doing a lot in charity anyway, so I mean Guinness came back and I'm around him up. I said look

2096
02:45:46.08 --> 02:45:50.80
I'm gonna cycle the world longest road and you know doing a world record what what should we do it and

2097
02:45:52.48 --> 02:45:53.44
The

2098
02:45:53.44 --> 02:46:00.64
This was 2016 so his brother and Kay and him were about a launch campaign in 2017 called heads together

2099
02:46:00.64 --> 02:46:07.68
Which was a mental health campaign and in the military I'd seen it firsthand, you know some my friends, you know and but I wasn't aware

2100
02:46:08.08 --> 02:46:12.88
How big an issue out of the hola society you know it's very much everyone talks about an hour days

2101
02:46:12.88 --> 02:46:13.92
Be it from

2102
02:46:13.92 --> 02:46:16.96
Post-natal depression young children teenagers all the way through

2103
02:46:17.44 --> 02:46:20.16
So he said look could I do it for that campaign?

2104
02:46:20.16 --> 02:46:22.16
I said yeah, Harry asked would you do it?

2105
02:46:22.16 --> 02:46:24.48
You're not gonna say no I said yeah, of course

2106
02:46:24.96 --> 02:46:26.96
So so it did that and then

2107
02:46:26.96 --> 02:46:31.52
He then introduced me to the rule foundation who sort of deal with all their charity work and

2108
02:46:32.32 --> 02:46:35.92
First you know you walk in the room and they're like the probably like I go one of Harry's mates

2109
02:46:36.96 --> 02:46:43.12
I sat down and they said right first question is how much you look in the rays and I thought I want I want to keep them at the table

2110
02:46:43.12 --> 02:46:50.24
I said a million pounds. I'll just shower it out and the but for me I wanted the norm entity of the challenge to reflect

2111
02:46:50.40 --> 02:46:54.32
How much you know you can't go do like the L.A. Mariffin say you're gonna raise a million pounds

2112
02:46:54.64 --> 02:46:56.000
That's that's the be

2113
02:46:56.000 --> 02:46:57.28
Comparison

2114
02:46:57.28 --> 02:47:00.16
That's it fine to sit on what's what's your message in?

2115
02:47:00.16 --> 02:47:03.12
I was I was shit. I didn't fall about how are you just talking to come in here?

2116
02:47:03.12 --> 02:47:06.80
I was I'm so I just thought about it. I said well physical activity

2117
02:47:07.20 --> 02:47:08.56
Help sure mental state

2118
02:47:08.56 --> 02:47:11.52
So I can't use that I said well why not?

2119
02:47:12.16 --> 02:47:14.16
What's not been scientifically proven?

2120
02:47:14.72 --> 02:47:18.24
So I said it's fine. I said but I don't need a scientist to tell me that I feel good when I'm

2121
02:47:18.56 --> 02:47:22.56
Been physically active so I ignored them anyway and carried on promoting that and then obviously now

2122
02:47:22.56 --> 02:47:30.000
It's very much recognized. Yeah, it's one of the COVID mechanisms. So so that was the birth of the the pan American highway challenge

2123
02:47:30.64 --> 02:47:34.96
So I fell into it by accident and there's a lot of people doubted you because you had

2124
02:47:36.24 --> 02:47:38.000
No experience on a bike

2125
02:47:38.000 --> 02:47:42.64
You know these other people that are sat in these records. You know, they they that's what their life is their

2126
02:47:43.12 --> 02:47:46.80
Experience racers and whatever else and you just decide yeah

2127
02:47:47.36 --> 02:47:49.36
Watch this hold my beer

2128
02:47:49.36 --> 02:47:54.96
We the sponsored my accident team we did a squat analysis that right at the beginning and it's it's strength

2129
02:47:54.96 --> 02:48:00.000
It's a weakness is your opportunities and fresh and the only weakness it came about was my arrogance towards a cycling community

2130
02:48:00.000 --> 02:48:02.000
Which I took as a strength and

2131
02:48:02.88 --> 02:48:07.68
Actually, yeah cycling it evolved so much someone I was a young boy on a BMX and

2132
02:48:08.64 --> 02:48:13.36
But for me it wasn't so much about the physical bit. I thought I'll deal with that on the time

2133
02:48:13.36 --> 02:48:18.48
It was there was the planet you know one of the things we'd got in the military is that meticulous planning and the detail

2134
02:48:18.48 --> 02:48:20.48
You know even in the Canadian embassy

2135
02:48:20.48 --> 02:48:22.16
I thought if you have the right plan

2136
02:48:22.56 --> 02:48:27.04
Then you just bring that in it you know, so I just took a military set of orders and put it on it

2137
02:48:27.04 --> 02:48:31.20
And I just crossed out ammunition and that's when I started if started putting the plan together

2138
02:48:31.68 --> 02:48:35.20
But I was taking experiences that I had in the military

2139
02:48:35.84 --> 02:48:38.000
From before I'm sort of putting it into this challenge

2140
02:48:38.000 --> 02:48:41.04
I love the phrase that you can't be experienced without experiences

2141
02:48:41.04 --> 02:48:44.16
So I've had experiences before and then what how can I sort of

2142
02:48:44.16 --> 02:48:50.000
Transferred out onto this so one thing we used to do in the special forces what I thought was it was great

2143
02:48:50.64 --> 02:48:55.68
Not because like we're one of the best in the world is because we're always evolving we're always learning and always changing and

2144
02:48:56.48 --> 02:49:00.64
When we come off the ground we just do a thing called a before we even go clean your weapons and add

2145
02:49:00.64 --> 02:49:02.40
Minous self it is called a hot debrief

2146
02:49:02.80 --> 02:49:07.12
You know while it's still fresh in your mind and the three questions that were posed were what worked?

2147
02:49:07.92 --> 02:49:12.000
What didn't work and if we were gonna do that again, what will we do differently?

2148
02:49:12.000 --> 02:49:16.88
So at the time I was reading magazines I was buying books about cycling

2149
02:49:16.88 --> 02:49:18.64
You know, but I wasn't getting those

2150
02:49:19.60 --> 02:49:22.32
Answers that I needed and I thought were the best people to speak to those

2151
02:49:22.88 --> 02:49:26.08
I've done it before you you know they've been there they've been on that road

2152
02:49:26.08 --> 02:49:28.08
They'll they'll be able to give me the answers

2153
02:49:28.08 --> 02:49:33.20
So I did I reached out to the previous record holders and I just posed those three questions

2154
02:49:34.08 --> 02:49:40.24
No, well getting all the information in all their issues they all all start in Alaska and finish in Argentina

2155
02:49:40.24 --> 02:49:44.72
But all their issues are in south and central America so for me, I was up

2156
02:49:44.72 --> 02:49:47.20
Well, why take a gamble with the second half?

2157
02:49:47.20 --> 02:49:53.76
You know why not get you know beat bureaucracy the borders languages spare to your bice why not address those issues early

2158
02:49:54.40 --> 02:50:00.48
Then when you get into America we can then reassess where we are so one of the things I was proud of is that I ignored everyone else

2159
02:50:00.48 --> 02:50:05.92
And I turned on his head my start point was from from southern Argentina

2160
02:50:05.92 --> 02:50:08.64
So that's that's how I came up with that plan

2161
02:50:08.64 --> 02:50:13.92
But there you know there's a lot more to it than just grabbing a water bottle and a helmet cycling north

2162
02:50:13.92 --> 02:50:16.08
You know, I mean when you're putting the plan in together

2163
02:50:16.08 --> 02:50:20.64
You know I had a support team and a documentary team who are very much more risk of earths and myself

2164
02:50:20.64 --> 02:50:22.64
You have to be considered in their welfare

2165
02:50:22.80 --> 02:50:25.44
So there's things you that you don't really think about elections

2166
02:50:25.44 --> 02:50:29.28
You know, what's the best time you're gonna go through a country in middle of elections and it's civil unrest

2167
02:50:30.24 --> 02:50:34.08
What's it? What's gonna give you the most advantage season wise? You know there's there's so much

2168
02:50:34.08 --> 02:50:41.12
Which is what we do in the military you know and that's what it was and um, so that's where the planning came from it's from what I

2169
02:50:41.12 --> 02:50:45.28
I picked up before and then training wise. Yeah, I then you know

2170
02:50:45.76 --> 02:50:47.76
Harry and I did a

2171
02:50:47.76 --> 02:50:51.68
Did a little promo video together to promote the challenge and once cameras finished he said

2172
02:50:52.24 --> 02:50:59.36
What training you're gonna do? That's it. Well, I'm gonna do lands in John Agro's lands in John Agro's is the southern point of England at Norm Scotland

2173
02:50:59.36 --> 02:51:06.96
And because the pan American high was 15 at Mb to back so I said if I can't do what I was I gonna do 15

2174
02:51:07.52 --> 02:51:11.36
So I said I'm gonna do that and he said what I do it with some of the members the Invictus games

2175
02:51:11.36 --> 02:51:12.64
I said yeah of course again

2176
02:51:12.64 --> 02:51:14.96
But I didn't want to do it with them and embarrass myself

2177
02:51:14.96 --> 02:51:17.36
So I haven't only psyched three weeks

2178
02:51:17.36 --> 02:51:22.40
I ran my mate and I said I'm gonna go do lands in John Agro's and everyone's at war

2179
02:51:23.04 --> 02:51:26.56
You're not ready yet. You don't know young in being cycling. You're not bike fit

2180
02:51:26.56 --> 02:51:31.84
And I thought bike fit was fitness. It's actually your measurements to your bike

2181
02:51:32.48 --> 02:51:40.000
Yeah, so I just rolled me to yeah, yeah, yeah, so I'd set up from Cornmore with first two days was a huge storm storm

2182
02:51:40.000 --> 02:51:43.04
Angus the third day I fell off my bike fractured my skate foie

2183
02:51:43.44 --> 02:51:49.04
I got up to Scotland. It was the coldest it'd been in 10 years. It was minus 16

2184
02:51:50.08 --> 02:51:53.76
I wrote off the first bike and my friend just went and bought one off the shelf

2185
02:51:53.76 --> 02:52:01.28
I did everything completely wrong in in cycling world but for me if I couldn't do one how was I gonna do 15

2186
02:52:02.08 --> 02:52:07.92
And and then we then did it six months later with these guys and I was bike fit

2187
02:52:07.92 --> 02:52:11.20
I knew about cadence and things like that and I understand

2188
02:52:11.20 --> 02:52:13.04
It might more than listen as in UK

2189
02:52:13.04 --> 02:52:18.48
Is that lands in John Agro's is a is on a bucket list for cyclists but for me it was a training ride

2190
02:52:18.48 --> 02:52:21.12
And I almost had to approach it in that manner

2191
02:52:21.12 --> 02:52:28.80
Yeah, well, what I like about all this I mean, it's it's something I I've been saying to veterans for a long time

2192
02:52:29.12 --> 02:52:32.80
Which is you know when you get out you got to find a new mission if you don't have a new mission

2193
02:52:32.96 --> 02:52:38.000
That's when things start going sideways and you know for you your first new mission was doing the security stuff

2194
02:52:38.000 --> 02:52:42.56
And you did that you attacked that and then all of a sudden you had to pull back from that to take care of your family

2195
02:52:43.60 --> 02:52:50.08
You you tried the new mission of the cubicle and the drawings that you as you called them that that was an emission for you

2196
02:52:50.08 --> 02:52:55.28
Then you got this in your head and now you had a new mission something to focus on something to do a positive thing and

2197
02:52:55.76 --> 02:53:03.68
You know obviously takes moves you in the right direction. It's just it's a really great example of something that I say all the time that you actually executed

2198
02:53:05.36 --> 02:53:07.36
This is an interesting section here

2199
02:53:08.000 --> 02:53:15.88
It's called who dares win who dares wins and you got a you got an unexpected call and the call the guy says my name's Andrew Slater

2200
02:53:15.88 --> 02:53:19.44
I'm a television producer and they had he had this idea. They're gonna take

2201
02:53:19.44 --> 02:53:24.000
Special forces soldiers and gonna put civilians through some kind of a

2202
02:53:25.28 --> 02:53:32.40
Form of some kind of selection and as he's doing this you know you're he's interested in having you be one of the guys

2203
02:53:34.000 --> 02:53:39.40
And the question was has this been cleared through the MOD through the Ministry of Defense and

2204
02:53:41.24 --> 02:53:46.40
You start running this up the chain of command and you're you know asking if this can happen or not

2205
02:53:46.40 --> 02:53:50.32
And then you get this going to the book here a couple weeks later. I received the letter

2206
02:53:50.32 --> 02:53:56.76
It wasn't exactly a pleasant memo from the MOD it cut straight to the point telling me to step away from the project immediately

2207
02:53:56.76 --> 02:54:00.48
I read over the letter a couple of times to make sure I had everything straight

2208
02:54:00.48 --> 02:54:07.96
But it was literally in black and white step away from the project or become persona non-grata

2209
02:54:08.64 --> 02:54:12.40
Yeah, which is png. I mean you're not you're not welcome anymore

2210
02:54:12.40 --> 02:54:19.76
Yeah, when it comes to decision making I always listened to my gut instinct and it was telling me loud and clear that I should

2211
02:54:19.76 --> 02:54:21.52
comply with the MOD's wishes

2212
02:54:21.52 --> 02:54:26.40
I was the SBS ambassador to Scotland and I enjoyed that role

2213
02:54:26.40 --> 02:54:29.40
I enjoyed the SBS Association charity events

2214
02:54:29.40 --> 02:54:32.60
I enjoyed being able to visit pool and heraford

2215
02:54:32.60 --> 02:54:40.20
I had good mates still in both did I want to cut that away in the vein hope of becoming the next

2216
02:54:40.72 --> 02:54:42.32
Jason Statham

2217
02:54:42.32 --> 02:54:44.32
The answer was clear

2218
02:54:44.32 --> 02:54:50.56
I can't do the show. I'm afraid mate. I told Andrew no worries. He said we thought this could be a problem

2219
02:54:51.12 --> 02:54:56.68
Have you approached the MOD about the show? I asked him you're going to have the same problem with everyone unless the show gets cleared

2220
02:54:56.68 --> 02:55:02.20
And you you go on you end up saying the show went ahead and as soon as it became public knowledge

2221
02:55:02.20 --> 02:55:05.000
There was a shitstorm at the MOD and in heraford in pool

2222
02:55:05.40 --> 02:55:12.28
The production company and the guys had pushed on without the MOD signing off in the SBS and SBS immediately cleared

2223
02:55:12.28 --> 02:55:18.40
Declared them persona non-Gradah. They were not allowed to attend any association events or to be on camp

2224
02:55:18.40 --> 02:55:25.04
To give you any idea of how seriously this was taken. I'd heard of a former general who was persona non-Gradah being

2225
02:55:25.60 --> 02:55:31.000
Escored off camp in heraford from his own from his own friends wake

2226
02:55:31.72 --> 02:55:36.76
I didn't want to see that happen to the guys, but it was their decision and not for me to question personally

2227
02:55:36.76 --> 02:55:40.20
I felt that this sense of community was important for my own happiness

2228
02:55:40.20 --> 02:55:44.40
And that wasn't worth giving up. I liked the lads. They're very close friends

2229
02:55:44.40 --> 02:55:51.68
And so I felt for one of them later that year when I saw him at a black tie event held by the regiment

2230
02:55:51.84 --> 02:55:55.98
He'd come as the guest of someone who is still serving but when the RSM saw him

2231
02:55:56.28 --> 02:55:59.48
He was asked to leave. He was he looked absolutely gutted and

2232
02:56:00.12 --> 02:56:03.80
Who am I to blame him? It wasn't many ways like being cast out of a family

2233
02:56:03.80 --> 02:56:10.52
So it's interesting too because the reason that was interesting to me is well because then you you wrote this book

2234
02:56:10.52 --> 02:56:13.40
Yeah, but obviously you clear this book through the ministry of defense

2235
02:56:14.16 --> 02:56:15.48
I've written a

2236
02:56:15.48 --> 02:56:19.52
I've written 49 books or whatever the numbers at this point and you know again

2237
02:56:19.52 --> 02:56:22.28
It's always very you know

2238
02:56:22.28 --> 02:56:26.92
I remember the conversations around when when I hadn't written a book and just saying like

2239
02:56:27.80 --> 02:56:31.80
We're not gonna do anything that sheds any light that puts anything

2240
02:56:31.80 --> 02:56:37.44
We don't have anything bad to say about the military about the seal teams like that's that's not what we're doing

2241
02:56:37.44 --> 02:56:40.12
We're obviously not giving away any

2242
02:56:41.000 --> 02:56:43.80
Information that could be useful at all to the enemy and

2243
02:56:45.12 --> 02:56:47.12
You know, that's obviously of

2244
02:56:47.92 --> 02:56:52.76
You know when when we ran these books when I ran these books through the chain of command

2245
02:56:53.24 --> 02:56:59.52
You know we it was like direct comms with people that I knew and that were in the military and senior ranking positions

2246
02:56:59.52 --> 02:57:03.24
And they read them and said yeah, these are good to go and you know I had a great

2247
02:57:04.32 --> 02:57:06.32
senior officer

2248
02:57:06.48 --> 02:57:12.64
Who said you know we're quiet professionals quiet professionals, but that doesn't mean we're silent professionals

2249
02:57:12.64 --> 02:57:16.16
There's stories that need to be told there's lessons that need to be passed on so

2250
02:57:17.000 --> 02:57:21.72
You know you look you can you never feel good about it because we're we're not

2251
02:57:21.96 --> 02:57:25.52
We don't want the spotlight you're never gonna feel good about it

2252
02:57:25.52 --> 02:57:28.60
And there's always gonna be guys that are gonna look at you and say oh, you know

2253
02:57:28.60 --> 02:57:35.44
There you are in the spotlight and that they're they're totally I understand them because I was that guy too

2254
02:57:35.44 --> 02:57:39.60
And so I get it and there's that's just the reality of the situation

2255
02:57:41.16 --> 02:57:47.04
But it was interesting to see how you had to go through that and and make those decisions yourself

2256
02:57:47.04 --> 02:57:51.08
Yeah, I think I think to me at the time when when Andrew came up you know

2257
02:57:51.08 --> 02:57:53.08
You're name keeps coming up as a fine and

2258
02:57:53.08 --> 02:57:58.12
And I there was an old documentary years ago at S.E. S.U. tough enough

2259
02:57:58.12 --> 02:58:01.44
It was a massive failure and I was like oh god, it's all I had him head was visions of that

2260
02:58:01.72 --> 02:58:05.92
So it went on and ended up being one of the most successful film

2261
02:58:06.56 --> 02:58:09.40
Episode on on channel 4 and the two guys I got on it

2262
02:58:09.40 --> 02:58:11.64
You know one of them he just come out you know

2263
02:58:11.64 --> 02:58:15.000
He got kicked out the military and he went to prison, you know for him

2264
02:58:15.000 --> 02:58:17.92
You know there was no other of our option for him

2265
02:58:17.92 --> 02:58:20.12
So here was a life line and then the other guy

2266
02:58:20.12 --> 02:58:23.80
And Foxy I'll say it was Foxy he he had post-might stress

2267
02:58:24.000 --> 02:58:30.48
So but he had post-might stress because his time served in the special forces he couldn't work in the private security sector for so for them guys

2268
02:58:31.16 --> 02:58:36.16
It fitted perfect for them. You know they they had a means of income for me at the time

2269
02:58:36.16 --> 02:58:39.92
It didn't work because I was smuggling people across borders

2270
02:58:40.64 --> 02:58:47.04
You know I was a really you know close relationship with Harry you know so at the time it then didn't look right that you were on TV

2271
02:58:47.04 --> 02:58:56.68
Say it wasn't you can't do it. It's not because as you touch on it people can learn from the military and and these sort of in a great for that

2272
02:58:56.68 --> 02:59:01.52
What upset the military with this was that they filmed it and then flanked them

2273
02:59:02.16 --> 02:59:06.08
You know so I've maybe not get my book out and things that you know

2274
02:59:06.08 --> 02:59:09.80
I'm still part of the group and I do charity work

2275
02:59:10.000 --> 02:59:13.40
But I've been transparent in everything I do and they understand

2276
02:59:13.40 --> 02:59:18.68
I think it was just the way that they've gone about it in the fact that they caught them out by by surprise

2277
02:59:18.96 --> 02:59:21.52
But for the for the two guys that I got on the show

2278
02:59:22.04 --> 02:59:27.46
You know they've now got successful careers in that and they would probably if they didn't have this show

2279
02:59:27.46 --> 02:59:30.48
They'd probably really be struggling you know coming out prison having post-might

2280
02:59:30.48 --> 02:59:35.38
It says but obviously the military also need to understand that it's a different world

2281
02:59:35.38 --> 02:59:41.16
You know social media. You know for me when I was in it was a taboo I was talking about before you know

2282
02:59:41.16 --> 02:59:47.30
You know is a way of communicating and obviously as long as you don't give away certain things

2283
02:59:47.64 --> 02:59:53.80
Then you can there's nothing that you can't get from the internet and I say and a lot of it is actually jealousy

2284
02:59:53.80 --> 02:59:58.52
You know a lot of it is actually jealousy from those stillings because they're not in that position

2285
02:59:58.52 --> 03:00:01.20
That they can they can do that but for me at the time

2286
03:00:01.20 --> 03:00:04.000
I just it just didn't didn't fit right

2287
03:00:06.24 --> 03:00:08.76
I'm gonna fast forward a little bit you know you

2288
03:00:08.76 --> 03:00:10.76
You

2289
03:00:10.76 --> 03:00:16.14
You're just training and you're fundraising and you're getting ready and you're doing all these taking all these skills

2290
03:00:16.14 --> 03:00:25.14
That you learn from the military for planning and endurance and mindset and you and you get to a point where you're you're gonna launch this thing and

2291
03:00:26.56 --> 03:00:30.66
You know you're you're supported on the ground. This is just so you you mentioned it

2292
03:00:30.66 --> 03:00:35.40
But you're supported on the ground by a sports massage therapist a bike mechanic a medic a two-man camera crew

2293
03:00:35.40 --> 03:00:41.36
That would be gathering footage to make a documentary about the event. It was a big team, but with the exception of the documentary crew

2294
03:00:42.04 --> 03:00:46.28
Everyone was doing it pro bono so wasn't a huge strain on our sponsors

2295
03:00:47.40 --> 03:00:49.40
um

2296
03:00:50.04 --> 03:00:54.76
And then finally we get to shortly after dawn on a one February

2297
03:00:55.16 --> 03:00:56.16
2018

2298
03:00:56.16 --> 03:00:59.96
I went with my team to the starting point of the pan American highway

2299
03:00:59.96 --> 03:01:03.78
I had 22,000 kilometers ahead of me and 110 days to do it

2300
03:01:03.78 --> 03:01:06.18
No crowds no big send off

2301
03:01:06.98 --> 03:01:08.98
Start freaking pedaling

2302
03:01:08.98 --> 03:01:10.50
Yeah

2303
03:01:10.50 --> 03:01:14.90
And you you you you you cover a lot of this in the book

2304
03:01:15.14 --> 03:01:23.14
You know talking about what what that's actually like what is what you're going through the wind the crashes the traffic the heat the cold

2305
03:01:23.54 --> 03:01:25.38
The illness the

2306
03:01:25.38 --> 03:01:30.58
Just the mayhem you know you you talked about you go through four seasons while you do that you go through all four seasons

2307
03:01:31.62 --> 03:01:33.62
and

2308
03:01:33.62 --> 03:01:35.62
So then you you you you're making progress

2309
03:01:36.82 --> 03:01:38.02
Um

2310
03:01:38.02 --> 03:01:42.66
And then what one time I'm going to the book here. I got instantly worried when I stopped for lunch and saw

2311
03:01:42.66 --> 03:01:47.86
I missed four calls from Alana usually she would just leave me a message asked me to call her back

2312
03:01:48.18 --> 03:01:54.98
I worried that something had gone wrong with the funding for the challenge or were still that something was up with Molly or Tommy your kids

2313
03:01:55.78 --> 03:02:00.82
I Face time to what's wrong I asked what do you wear to a royal wedding Alana said?

2314
03:02:00.82 --> 03:02:03.38
I had no idea what she was talking about what do you mean?

2315
03:02:03.86 --> 03:02:11.70
What do you wear to a royal wedding she said again then lifted up a card so I could see it Alana and I had been invited to Harry and Megan's wedding

2316
03:02:12.26 --> 03:02:17.94
I didn't see that one coming. I told her honestly Harry was a mate but a royal wedding isn't for a few beers in the local

2317
03:02:18.34 --> 03:02:22.50
When is it Alana smiled she knew that I'd know the date was

2318
03:02:23.06 --> 03:02:26.34
The date I was due to finish in Alaska off by heart

2319
03:02:26.82 --> 03:02:30.02
19th of May she said and I heard myself grown

2320
03:02:30.02 --> 03:02:32.74
That was four days earlier than I was expected

2321
03:02:33.30 --> 03:02:37.54
Expecting to break the world record the last flight you can catch is on day 102

2322
03:02:38.18 --> 03:02:40.18
You better put your foot down

2323
03:02:41.22 --> 03:02:43.38
So you get the invite to go to the big wedding

2324
03:02:43.70 --> 03:02:49.46
Yeah, so the will record was 117 days and when I was doing my plan in I thought you know

2325
03:02:50.10 --> 03:02:54.58
This certain contingencies those things that are out your control bit natural disasters

2326
03:02:54.58 --> 03:03:00.26
Coos and things that so far by encounter any of them on the challenge you know I don't want to eat into the challenge

2327
03:03:00.26 --> 03:03:04.90
So my target was 110 days and it's because we had that that fun

2328
03:03:05.46 --> 03:03:12.98
So give yourself seven days of budget I gave myself seven days of seven days of budget should it be something out there control was an eating into the record time

2329
03:03:12.98 --> 03:03:15.86
It was eating into that and then I done all my planning on that you know

2330
03:03:16.10 --> 03:03:21.86
I think called the Bible you know a new every inch of the road we'd we'd planned it out had on paper had it on digital

2331
03:03:21.86 --> 03:03:27.22
We know South America I did it in 48 days. It will record was 58 days

2332
03:03:27.22 --> 03:03:30.82
So I took 10 days off the first will record and as you touched on there, you know

2333
03:03:30.82 --> 03:03:36.26
You had food poisoning you had everything else but those things that I didn't see as well

2334
03:03:36.26 --> 03:03:37.70
You know when I was putting the plans together

2335
03:03:37.70 --> 03:03:40.58
No the medic I had to send home you know it was not in the book

2336
03:03:40.58 --> 03:03:46.02
You know, but I had to send the medic home on day 13 because it was bullying the documentary is like my god

2337
03:03:46.34 --> 03:03:50.18
The bike ride was actually easier than managing egos egos

2338
03:03:50.18 --> 03:03:57.94
You know because they're pro bono they all started wanting one in more from the challenge as they saw it evolving and thankfully my wife was a campaign direct

2339
03:03:57.94 --> 03:04:00.90
She was sort of managing keeping control of that we got to

2340
03:04:01.70 --> 03:04:03.46
I've talked about you know

2341
03:04:03.54 --> 03:04:06.98
Going from South to North that was a great decision from a side-con perspective. I've got

2342
03:04:07.54 --> 03:04:10.50
Tailwind all the way through prudus two thousand five hundred kilometers tailwind

2343
03:04:10.90 --> 03:04:15.38
But every checkpoint every border we're having this swap vehicles. It's that was slowing us down

2344
03:04:15.62 --> 03:04:18.42
So the plan was to have an RV and a four by four

2345
03:04:18.42 --> 03:04:21.38
Ship from Fort Lauderdale of two to Panama

2346
03:04:21.78 --> 03:04:25.54
So then when we did the second part of the challenge that would take us all the way to Alaska

2347
03:04:25.54 --> 03:04:29.62
I was in Ecuador and my wife who rang me instead of the vehicles haven't

2348
03:04:30.02 --> 03:04:32.66
Got onto the shipping container. She's that cry

2349
03:04:32.98 --> 03:04:38.90
So thankfully my wife and my PA and two my mates had four side they flew over to Fort Lauderdale

2350
03:04:38.90 --> 03:04:43.62
And they drove the vehicles four thousand miles in eight days my wife left the kids and mother's day

2351
03:04:43.62 --> 03:04:51.22
Back in UK and they drove it all the way to Panama I broke the wheel record in the morning flew across the Daringup and they just handed the keys over

2352
03:04:51.22 --> 03:04:56.58
You know so the integral part of this challenge you know people see you on social media

2353
03:04:56.58 --> 03:04:58.58
It's the team around you that it don't see

2354
03:04:59.38 --> 03:05:02.82
We then get to Mexico and the mechanic and the soft tissue therapists

2355
03:05:02.82 --> 03:05:05.30
Like these are new terms and conditions. I'm now

2356
03:05:05.86 --> 03:05:08.26
Project manager. We're gonna change the name to this

2357
03:05:08.26 --> 03:05:13.78
Oh, there we go. You know, and this has been going on flight nearly two months now. They said you can't do this with ours

2358
03:05:14.42 --> 03:05:15.70
I left them in prebloos

2359
03:05:15.70 --> 03:05:20.82
See hold my beer. Yeah, oh my beer my mate then drove the RV and then we we just pushed on it

2360
03:05:20.82 --> 03:05:23.78
We didn't have a mechanic but we weren't far from the American border

2361
03:05:24.10 --> 03:05:29.46
So when I got to the American border I got the American border on day 70 and I was 14 days ahead of the wheel record

2362
03:05:29.46 --> 03:05:31.46
I didn't realize

2363
03:05:31.70 --> 03:05:34.58
How important it was getting to America. I don't know where it was because

2364
03:05:34.58 --> 03:05:38.90
Everyone spoke our language. I wasn't on Google translate for the last two and half months

2365
03:05:38.90 --> 03:05:43.70
You know the culinary options were better or probably because the previous record holders

2366
03:05:44.34 --> 03:05:47.78
All their issues were in south and central of I left all that behind me

2367
03:05:47.78 --> 03:05:52.42
We're now it should be a smooth road and also the fact that if there is any mechanical issues

2368
03:05:52.42 --> 03:05:55.38
We can just get another mechanic you know we can find a massage part

2369
03:05:55.38 --> 03:05:58.34
And that was the hardest thing for my wife trying to find a massage part

2370
03:05:58.34 --> 03:06:00.34
It was the right massage part

2371
03:06:00.34 --> 03:06:05.94
So getting into America was that 14 days ahead perfect and then I had that phone call

2372
03:06:06.42 --> 03:06:08.42
Yeah, which is great, but I

2373
03:06:08.90 --> 03:06:13.38
Was now going into that phone call was 14 days ahead 10 minutes late. I'm now a day behind

2374
03:06:14.42 --> 03:06:20.02
So all that effort so I've done up until then all that drama has not let it meant nothing is like

2375
03:06:20.50 --> 03:06:22.50
You've now got a new objective

2376
03:06:22.50 --> 03:06:24.90
So cycling in South America

2377
03:06:24.90 --> 03:06:31.94
Because obviously the sports team and documentary mainstream being risk adverse you know had to consider them so I had to cycle from first light to last light

2378
03:06:31.94 --> 03:06:34.34
And that was it and I was off the road again in South America

2379
03:06:34.34 --> 03:06:40.34
It's a lot more safe so I could cycle at night and I got to love it in Texas the next day and I

2380
03:06:40.90 --> 03:06:43.86
60 mile an hour winds and tornadoes. I was grounded for another

2381
03:06:44.58 --> 03:06:49.22
In other 24 hours. I was now two days behind my new target so

2382
03:06:50.26 --> 03:06:52.90
Again, I just looked at the plan look to the paperwork

2383
03:06:52.90 --> 03:06:59.86
And as an app on your phone call windy TV it's quite popular with sailors and it gives you the strength and directions of the winds forecasted every hour

2384
03:07:00.18 --> 03:07:04.18
for the next two weeks about 95% accurate. It's 95%

2385
03:07:04.18 --> 03:07:10.34
That 95% is a great it's a great app yeah and it was known as my second wife on this because I was just always looking at windy TV

2386
03:07:10.82 --> 03:07:16.50
So for me to get out a little bit at a cycle 340 miles in 36 hours to miss the next weather winter and

2387
03:07:16.82 --> 03:07:19.78
And that's why I did with North America. I just played chess with mother nature

2388
03:07:19.78 --> 03:07:24.66
Through North America and majority of cycling was done at night because you know the winds

2389
03:07:24.66 --> 03:07:28.98
Yeah less wind got to Cheyenne picked up the 50 mile an hour tailwind

2390
03:07:29.54 --> 03:07:34.90
So I covered 260 miles in the 11 hours cycling so I was also using it to my advantage

2391
03:07:34.90 --> 03:07:39.22
So I I gained up that time I had about 17 days originally on of me

2392
03:07:39.22 --> 03:07:44.10
I did it in 11 a half and I thought perfect and then we got to a town called White Horse

2393
03:07:44.10 --> 03:07:46.42
But a week outside from the end on the four

2394
03:07:46.42 --> 03:07:50.66
You know wheel record secure I'm going it's wedding unless I get eaten by a grizzly

2395
03:07:51.46 --> 03:07:56.90
And then this gentleman's this guy's come on on social media that day professional cyclist

2396
03:07:56.90 --> 03:08:01.38
He's already got free other endurance wheel records mid-twenties sponsored by all the big brands Red Bull

2397
03:08:01.38 --> 03:08:05.14
And he's he's announced that he's gonna do the pan American highway in August

2398
03:08:05.54 --> 03:08:08.34
Be the first man to do 100 days. So that's great

2399
03:08:08.98 --> 03:08:12.90
So every time I thought I had met my objective, you know it then moved

2400
03:08:12.90 --> 03:08:19.06
But thankfully for me if I'd known about that start the challenge if I'd known about the wedding known about this guy

2401
03:08:19.06 --> 03:08:22.10
You know I may not have pushed I may have pushed myself too hard

2402
03:08:22.82 --> 03:08:25.74
But thankfully me when I received that information I was in a position

2403
03:08:26.38 --> 03:08:30.34
That I could act on it. So yeah, I cycle for you know the last two days

2404
03:08:31.22 --> 03:08:35.62
I had 250 miles to do and it's Dalton's highway. It's where to film ice truckers

2405
03:08:36.34 --> 03:08:41.54
It's that road there and I thought well I did 250 I do 150 miles today

2406
03:08:41.54 --> 03:08:49.86
And a hundred miles on the last day and then I'm in my family of my wife my kids are on on the on this oil field in Prudo Bay at the end

2407
03:08:49.86 --> 03:08:51.86
So I know there are only a couple of days away

2408
03:08:52.82 --> 03:08:59.54
Did the first 50 miles and I got this roadblock at noon and the guilt was that no you can't pass the late of clock tonight

2409
03:09:00.18 --> 03:09:08.30
So so that evening that's a rest for eight hours and you're not resting and I just cycled from eight o'clock that night

2410
03:09:08.30 --> 03:09:14.78
7 o'clock the next night 200 miles in minus 18 to make sure that came in in 99 days and 12 hours

2411
03:09:15.10 --> 03:09:17.10
So I talk about

2412
03:09:17.10 --> 03:09:19.10
the importance of planning but actually

2413
03:09:20.46 --> 03:09:24.22
The success of this was being reactive to the situation on the ground

2414
03:09:24.22 --> 03:09:27.18
You have a plan that's great you have a start point you have an objective

2415
03:09:27.98 --> 03:09:30.22
But you know things change is you know

2416
03:09:30.22 --> 03:09:38.46
It's best planning will survive first contact and and that's what it was it's been no reactive to that situation and that even to the very last day

2417
03:09:38.46 --> 03:09:40.30
I was having to change change the plan

2418
03:09:40.30 --> 03:09:46.62
Yeah, even that even when you talked about the fudge factor which some people would have planned that and just had okay

2419
03:09:46.62 --> 03:09:47.82
I got to be doing

2420
03:09:48.38 --> 03:09:53.26
225 days or 123 days cool that's what they're gonna book they don't understand all the things

2421
03:09:53.82 --> 03:09:58.62
The amount of room that gives you to make those adaptations when you need to is again

2422
03:09:58.62 --> 03:10:00.06
That's something we learn about the

2423
03:10:00.86 --> 03:10:04.70
Things are not going to go smooth that's one big I can promise you

2424
03:10:05.66 --> 03:10:06.54
Um

2425
03:10:06.54 --> 03:10:08.30
I'm gonna read one more thing out of the book here

2426
03:10:08.70 --> 03:10:15.26
Athletes talk a lot about visualization and how they had imagined their final moment of victory again and again and again

2427
03:10:15.26 --> 03:10:21.26
I'd done the same but now that I drew close to the finish line my moment was nothing like I had ever imagined it

2428
03:10:21.82 --> 03:10:26.78
This was no ride along the Shoms to Leize with me leaning back in the seat with my hands in the air

2429
03:10:26.78 --> 03:10:35.02
I clung on to my handlebars for dear life hitting one patch of black eyes after another my face was covered in frozen

2430
03:10:35.02 --> 03:10:41.98
Snot my muscles were shaking from fatigue and cold and every blast of Arctic wind cut through me to the bone

2431
03:10:43.02 --> 03:10:45.02
But I made it

2432
03:10:48.22 --> 03:10:52.22
And there you go you skid it to the finish line. I pulled my wife and kids into a hug

2433
03:10:52.22 --> 03:10:54.94
I was so exhausted that I probably can't remember what I said

2434
03:10:54.94 --> 03:10:56.94
I was probably talking gibberish

2435
03:10:57.90 --> 03:11:01.90
But I'd miss them all so much and they got big kisses from their dad's cracked lips

2436
03:11:02.62 --> 03:11:06.86
Molly was aware of what was going on and full of beans but Tommy was in the world of his own

2437
03:11:07.98 --> 03:11:11.66
I thought it was I thought it must be hallucinating when I saw the lady from Guinness was

2438
03:11:12.06 --> 03:11:14.22
Braving the cold in tights in a skirt

2439
03:11:14.22 --> 03:11:18.86
But there wasn't one ounce of discomfort on her face as she presented me with my record

2440
03:11:18.86 --> 03:11:23.90
I was now the record holder for the fastest cycle of the Pan American Highway completing it 99 days

2441
03:11:23.90 --> 03:11:27.50
Which also made me the first person to ever do it on in under a hundred

2442
03:11:28.22 --> 03:11:29.58
a hug my wife

2443
03:11:29.58 --> 03:11:31.58
But unlike in car to Hena

2444
03:11:31.58 --> 03:11:35.34
This wasn't the place to stand around for a post certificate photo shoot

2445
03:11:35.34 --> 03:11:42.46
Let's get to the hotel. I told my family and team as we piled into vehicles leaving the frost bit in finish line behind us

2446
03:11:45.50 --> 03:11:47.50
So you made it and

2447
03:11:47.50 --> 03:11:53.34
But that's not the end that's not the end it's not the end of the book and it's definitely

2448
03:11:53.98 --> 03:11:57.82
Definitely not the end of the path that you're on right now because

2449
03:11:59.02 --> 03:12:01.02
You need it a new mission right?

2450
03:12:01.02 --> 03:12:02.06
Yeah

2451
03:12:02.06 --> 03:12:05.42
Tell us what's up what's your next challenge where you get where you had next?

2452
03:12:05.42 --> 03:12:11.66
Yeah, so my U.S.P is you know, I take a sport or discipline. I've never done before and find a bit of this child

2453
03:12:11.66 --> 03:12:18.14
A biggest challenge so I've been arrogant towards a cycling community. It's now going to be the kayaking community so the next challenge is to

2454
03:12:18.46 --> 03:12:23.18
Kayak the river now the world's longest river from source to sea so it's never been done before

2455
03:12:23.66 --> 03:12:28.38
So unlike there where I can speak to previous record holders it's not been done before so

2456
03:12:29.10 --> 03:12:34.94
The plan was obviously to do it last year. Obviously COVID's you know, put a scupper to that and that's why I'm here in America

2457
03:12:35.66 --> 03:12:39.98
Whilst the world is paused let's get over here get set up and get ready for that

2458
03:12:39.98 --> 03:12:45.50
So yeah 4,280 miles but you know unlike truckers and and support team you got a worry

2459
03:12:45.50 --> 03:12:51.90
I've got crocodiles hippos civil war in South Sudan but one thing I'm excited about this challenge

2460
03:12:51.90 --> 03:12:55.90
You know I talk about we talked about the successful private security missions

2461
03:12:55.90 --> 03:13:02.22
You know everyone's quite quick to tarnish certain communities you know with one brush what they see with with TV

2462
03:13:02.78 --> 03:13:03.74
You know

2463
03:13:03.74 --> 03:13:07.90
If it wasn't for those local communities being so hospitable I would never been in success

2464
03:13:07.90 --> 03:13:13.82
Well on them and that's where they African now is going to be great because it's I'm going to have to rely on the locals to help me and so

2465
03:13:14.86 --> 03:13:18.22
You know it's not a real record whatever I do is the world record

2466
03:13:19.42 --> 03:13:21.42
But one of the so that's the next challenge

2467
03:13:22.22 --> 03:13:27.90
But one of the big feedbacks on the book is yes great endurance, but you are the security guru

2468
03:13:28.14 --> 03:13:35.26
Why you still not in this industry so for me I've I've got a niche security company you know very low key

2469
03:13:35.26 --> 03:13:39.82
We help either corporates. I'll try and it works and things that because

2470
03:13:40.38 --> 03:13:43.74
Paddling in cycling doesn't put food on the table and the wife keeps reminding me

2471
03:13:44.94 --> 03:13:50.06
So but yeah, so I've set a date first the February next year and we set off on that

2472
03:13:50.62 --> 03:13:55.50
So you've got a team you know obviously that's doing the security work under your guidance

2473
03:13:55.50 --> 03:13:59.26
So what's the how do people getting getting contact with you for that type of business?

2474
03:13:59.26 --> 03:14:02.38
So we you know originally I wasn't going to have a website and things like that

2475
03:14:02.38 --> 03:14:08.22
But you know we will have a website this password protected because for me the my approach to security is

2476
03:14:08.22 --> 03:14:11.98
You know that there's certain ways of security up my as is more intelligent space

2477
03:14:11.98 --> 03:14:16.62
You know you have the private element you know we then have the intelligence side of it and then and then the cyber

2478
03:14:16.94 --> 03:14:21.74
You know we don't you know I don't normally walk around with type black t-shirts with tattoos

2479
03:14:21.74 --> 03:14:27.50
You know we blend in and things that and it's just having that approach that I've used before

2480
03:14:27.50 --> 03:14:33.26
Um, so yeah, you go in my website you can get in touch with them, but the new websites get in bill

2481
03:14:33.26 --> 03:14:37.02
And that's what I've been doing this last four months is set up the business preparing for the Nile

2482
03:14:37.98 --> 03:14:40.94
And your website is

2483
03:14:41.18 --> 03:14:44.94
Dean stopped I was calling you Dean Scott. I'm sure you've been called that a million times

2484
03:14:44.94 --> 03:14:49.58
I was calling I was calling you Dean start or Dean Scott my wife was calling you Dean Scott

2485
03:14:49.98 --> 03:14:53.58
So it's Dean start STOTTT dot com

2486
03:14:53.58 --> 03:14:59.50
That's it is where we can find you also you're on Facebook Dean STOTS BS

2487
03:15:00.30 --> 03:15:01.90
You're on Instagram

2488
03:15:01.90 --> 03:15:05.50
Which I go only calls the gram at Dean's stop

2489
03:15:06.70 --> 03:15:08.94
It's real quick on the Nile

2490
03:15:09.66 --> 03:15:11.98
What's what's like the major

2491
03:15:11.98 --> 03:15:17.50
Challenges there what's the what's the what's the what's the hardest level rapids they have there so merch is in fools

2492
03:15:18.30 --> 03:15:21.10
Is it most powerful? What for and will it's grade six?

2493
03:15:21.10 --> 03:15:28.22
Great six what for but the problem you have with the what for there is the they take the the crocodiles and the hippos from late Victorian put them in mercenaries

2494
03:15:28.78 --> 03:15:32.54
So when you come down there they're all in the in the pools at the bottom so

2495
03:15:33.66 --> 03:15:37.02
Originally when we're going to do it if it were record this it I you can only use one boat

2496
03:15:37.02 --> 03:15:42.46
That's just not going to be feasible in a ninety three percent and Nile's quite flat so we'll use like almost like a ski

2497
03:15:43.02 --> 03:15:48.46
To go on that but then use a creek boat for grades free to fall and then a raft

2498
03:15:48.46 --> 03:15:53.82
We'll have to use a raft on on someone who's big ones are you going to have like a sniper overwatch for

2499
03:15:54.38 --> 03:15:55.58
Crocodiles yeah

2500
03:15:55.58 --> 03:16:00.62
There's going to be a guy coming a guy called Peter Meridiff actually he's he watched his friend get at by a crock

2501
03:16:00.62 --> 03:16:04.46
Koyakin in the DRC, you know, so he knows in Nile inside out

2502
03:16:04.46 --> 03:16:07.90
You know, he's talking about throwing stones. I'm thinking to use them for something a bit more powerful

2503
03:16:08.78 --> 03:16:10.70
But local lies you know

2504
03:16:10.70 --> 03:16:13.82
I want to bring as many locals in as I can because

2505
03:16:13.82 --> 03:16:19.18
Especially the fishermen they know them more ways better than anyone so if this crocks and hippos in that pool

2506
03:16:19.18 --> 03:16:20.78
I'll just portage it

2507
03:16:20.78 --> 03:16:23.82
I'm going to paddle through or walk walk around it

2508
03:16:24.62 --> 03:16:30.14
Message wise, you know, we one thing we're passionate about as modern-slave in human trafficking and we're thinking of

2509
03:16:30.46 --> 03:16:32.62
Using this challenge to promote that but then that sort of

2510
03:16:33.58 --> 03:16:38.38
Channels engine just one campaign the great thing about the Nile is you know, it's the lifeline of Africa

2511
03:16:38.38 --> 03:16:40.38
We can talk about poverty pollution

2512
03:16:40.38 --> 03:16:46.70
COVID, you know, so we're going to talk about the so many so many things along the the challenge

2513
03:16:47.26 --> 03:16:52.62
Do you have a date plan to launch that first of February? I self oh dang next year

2514
03:16:53.18 --> 03:16:55.18
One year yeah

2515
03:16:56.06 --> 03:17:01.82
You have to have a start point. I genuinely you have to have a start point. We've done other a start point

2516
03:17:02.22 --> 03:17:08.46
Then the start point becomes never yeah comes never keeps moving to the right you have a start point and many can start approach

2517
03:17:08.46 --> 03:17:15.02
In sponsors and start working back from that so it gives me a year now to train at new port of Quaggs and uh and uh

2518
03:17:15.50 --> 03:17:17.74
You know when look out you know get a get sponsorship

2519
03:17:18.62 --> 03:17:20.62
The book is called relentless

2520
03:17:21.50 --> 03:17:22.54
That the

2521
03:17:22.54 --> 03:17:25.90
subtitle is from sbs to world record breaker

2522
03:17:28.14 --> 03:17:30.62
Echo you got anything else? How's your leg?

2523
03:17:32.06 --> 03:17:37.82
Yeah, so when I actually started the the training now I went to see a doctor and you know

2524
03:17:37.82 --> 03:17:43.18
I would test him the string from my quads and my hamstring. I mean it was it was him that identified you know your leg is too

2525
03:17:43.18 --> 03:17:45.18
Keylo's light. Oh that really

2526
03:17:45.82 --> 03:17:47.98
When I sit off into challenge I got the muscle

2527
03:17:48.70 --> 03:17:54.86
Mass back my hamstring was 18% less power but you know it's it's still good. No we're good to go. So

2528
03:17:55.74 --> 03:18:00.14
Do the bother you like day like day to day can stuff? No no I you know

2529
03:18:00.94 --> 03:18:05.26
Jo that my wife didn't marry me could have looked like lands on some or Chris Fremor try not going like

2530
03:18:05.26 --> 03:18:11.10
Chris often as a can but you know for me any and I still try and push you push on the bike now and then

2531
03:18:12.38 --> 03:18:14.38
Crazy yeah the

2532
03:18:15.18 --> 03:18:20.94
I mean it's awesome it's awesome what you've done to support these charities as well the heads together and and

2533
03:18:21.18 --> 03:18:24.78
I'm sure you're gonna support some some awesome charities for this next event

2534
03:18:24.78 --> 03:18:29.66
Patta little nile hopefully you won't support the charity of uh free food for hippos

2535
03:18:30.70 --> 03:18:32.70
rocks

2536
03:18:32.70 --> 03:18:37.50
But uh yeah people can get this book on the art we'll put a link for it on the website and

2537
03:18:39.42 --> 03:18:44.54
Awesome you got any final any final thoughts Dean? No I think you know when you see the website

2538
03:18:44.54 --> 03:18:47.82
You'll see the frogman and everyone's out why the frog Macno you always got the question

2539
03:18:47.82 --> 03:18:52.94
Know what's the difference between you and the other guys and I'm going back to my original one

2540
03:18:52.94 --> 03:18:57.26
The my reason for going SPS because I thought no they're all divers and they weren't I ended up being

2541
03:18:57.26 --> 03:19:03.34
the number one frogman so for me I'm not I'm not a cyclist I love I love the water

2542
03:19:03.34 --> 03:19:08.14
So we we have the nile and then another one which jockey more welcome a commonite's called surfing with pirates

2543
03:19:08.14 --> 03:19:13.74
Gonna surf to Somali coastline oh yeah that's not surfing with pirates that's surfing with sharks

2544
03:19:15.74 --> 03:19:19.02
Exactly but again it's promoting these these countries and you know

2545
03:19:19.98 --> 03:19:24.94
Amazing countries as well but obviously being as close to the water as I can yeah

2546
03:19:24.94 --> 03:19:31.02
I'm gamer I'd never got a chance to go into Somalia south off the coast of Somalia for months and months and then in the 90s waiting to go in

2547
03:19:31.02 --> 03:19:33.98
I never got the chance so I didn't get to go operate

2548
03:19:33.98 --> 03:19:38.86
I'll get some barrels let's let's rock and all but there's there's breaks and beaches with no names actually

2549
03:19:38.86 --> 03:19:43.98
So the plan is to you know from the north to the south but you know again people see what they see on TV

2550
03:19:43.98 --> 03:19:46.86
And make it there are some strange straight away when I was in Mogadish you again

2551
03:19:46.86 --> 03:19:52.86
I work on my own and work with a locals and I was like spear fishing for lobsters and and everyone and you want think you're in Mogadish

2552
03:19:52.86 --> 03:19:54.86
But because it hasn't been

2553
03:19:54.86 --> 03:20:00.06
commercially fish for years as a huge abundance of wildlife as well. Yeah, I think my wife

2554
03:20:00.46 --> 03:20:03.18
Anyone you you pick it up when you when you read the book you know

2555
03:20:04.22 --> 03:20:07.18
It's a team effort you know my transition

2556
03:20:07.74 --> 03:20:09.02
From the military

2557
03:20:09.02 --> 03:20:11.18
I wouldn't have been as smooth it wasn't for my wife

2558
03:20:11.18 --> 03:20:15.58
We're very much we know our strengths and weaknesses no my wife can't ride a bike no I can

2559
03:20:15.90 --> 03:20:18.86
But my wife is very good at all all the planning and I and

2560
03:20:18.86 --> 03:20:25.02
She was key to success success of the challenge and the success of my time in the security

2561
03:20:25.02 --> 03:20:30.06
I generally believe that anyone can break a will record if you take away all those distractions

2562
03:20:30.06 --> 03:20:34.86
You know the business the mortgage you know who's looking after the kids and that's what Alana does

2563
03:20:35.42 --> 03:20:39.26
Really well and and then again my my young children of you know

2564
03:20:40.06 --> 03:20:44.86
9 and 4 I saw a joke that when my my son or it was two and a half

2565
03:20:44.86 --> 03:20:48.06
The challenge when we finished the challenge you know

2566
03:20:48.70 --> 03:20:51.98
The challenge was older than my son something you just thought I was the cyclist

2567
03:20:52.54 --> 03:20:57.58
And my daughter she was born after I left the military so when I tell her that you know dad was the soldiers

2568
03:20:57.58 --> 03:21:01.98
She said you were an assortious and my son things are a cyclist and my daughter things are my water me

2569
03:21:03.18 --> 03:21:08.14
So I sort of joke about that but again, you know they're very they're very much look up to my

2570
03:21:08.14 --> 03:21:16.14
Mom and dad, you know and they travel everywhere with us and they've been all over the world in our Alaska South America and Australia and things that are so very lucky to have that

2571
03:21:16.14 --> 03:21:22.54
I think people think once you have children, that's it. She'll travel in days over, you know, don't let them dictate you know your life

2572
03:21:23.50 --> 03:21:25.50
Well awesome all

2581
03:21:58.22 --> 03:22:00.22
Dean stop has left the building

2582
03:22:00.22 --> 03:22:04.54
Talking about his incredibly incredible journey

2583
03:22:05.82 --> 03:22:07.82
Pretty crazy stories

2584
03:22:09.10 --> 03:22:12.70
The the relentless pursuit of perfection

2585
03:22:13.26 --> 03:22:15.26
Yeah, it's even writes about that in the book

2586
03:22:16.14 --> 03:22:22.78
A lot I only read it once today, but it's in there quite a few times that mindset the special the British special forces mindset of the

2587
03:22:23.26 --> 03:22:25.90
relentless pursuit of perfection

2588
03:22:25.90 --> 03:22:27.90
Awesome to have him on here and

2589
03:22:27.90 --> 03:22:33.10
Thanks Dean for coming on and echo Charles yes, sir speaking of

2590
03:22:34.70 --> 03:22:37.10
A relentless pursuit of perfection

2591
03:22:38.54 --> 03:22:42.86
You have any suggestions that could maybe enable our

2592
03:22:43.50 --> 03:22:49.42
Relantless pursuit of perfection. We're not gonna get there by the way. Yeah, but we're gonna pursue it. Yeah

2593
03:22:50.46 --> 03:22:55.66
I will say facilitate okay. I said enable enable for some and facilitate for sure

2594
03:22:55.66 --> 03:22:59.26
Okay, look with you are are all of us trying to break Guinness

2595
03:23:00.22 --> 03:23:03.34
World records for the book we are not

2596
03:23:03.82 --> 03:23:07.26
Maybe not no fact actually not every not everyone currently

2597
03:23:07.26 --> 03:23:10.54
Just actually can say that but we're on a path though we're on our own path

2598
03:23:11.18 --> 03:23:13.66
Right, not path is not easy. That's why we're on it

2599
03:23:14.70 --> 03:23:17.82
In fact if it's easy, is it even a path really not really no

2600
03:23:19.02 --> 03:23:23.66
I guess technically it's the path of least resistance. Yes, watch out for that

2601
03:23:23.66 --> 03:23:26.54
That's the different kind of we know that it leads downhill that path and we take it

2602
03:23:26.54 --> 03:23:32.70
Yeah, it's looking for that path. We're not looking for it. We're not on it. We're not even that's not our jam in any way

2603
03:23:32.70 --> 03:23:34.54
But the path that we are on is hard

2604
03:23:35.34 --> 03:23:43.26
Obstacles pitfalls and traps and wise men once said but on that path you're gonna endure or you have to endure some sort of pain

2605
03:23:45.58 --> 03:23:47.58
In your joints

2606
03:23:47.66 --> 03:23:52.30
Depends on what you're doing obviously, but most people are gonna enjoy that. Yes, endure

2607
03:23:52.30 --> 03:23:57.98
Yeah, and look that I'm not saying you should worry about that and in fact if you really don't want to worry about that

2608
03:23:57.98 --> 03:23:59.66
Guess what Jacob has some supplements?

2609
03:23:59.66 --> 03:24:01.26
How about that?

2610
03:24:01.26 --> 03:24:05.34
For you joints okay, we got John. I think there's anyone that's curious about how you're gonna bring it all together

2611
03:24:05.34 --> 03:24:09.34
Oh, you know if I like oh here it comes you got oh there he did he did it again

2612
03:24:09.34 --> 03:24:13.50
Hey look wherever you're trying to sensationalize these things to make them sensational

2613
03:24:13.50 --> 03:24:16.70
Okay, hopefully I don't think there's anything sensational about it. Here's the deal

2614
03:24:16.70 --> 03:24:19.18
You don't want to have joint issues

2615
03:24:19.18 --> 03:24:24.38
No, so you want to do things that take care of your joints. Yes, by joints. I mean shoulder

2616
03:24:24.94 --> 03:24:26.14
elbow

2617
03:24:26.14 --> 03:24:32.30
Me neck whatever you want to call it if it's a joint in your body you don't want it to give you with issues

2618
03:24:33.10 --> 03:24:36.78
You don't want that no, so that's why we made joint warfare

2619
03:24:37.74 --> 03:24:39.74
Go to war against that

2620
03:24:39.74 --> 03:24:41.74
That

2621
03:24:42.30 --> 03:24:47.22
And cruel oil by the way super cruel oil. Yes. Yeah, so now we don't even have to worry about that

2622
03:24:47.22 --> 03:24:52.50
Can stuff so there's a lot of things that you should be concerned about on this path

2623
03:24:52.90 --> 03:24:53.94
Distraction

2624
03:24:53.94 --> 03:24:55.94
Temptation if you will

2625
03:24:55.94 --> 03:25:00.74
Your friends sometimes and let's face it you're joint you don't want to want to have to worry about that

2626
03:25:00.74 --> 03:25:02.82
And stuff take the joint warfare every day

2627
03:25:03.54 --> 03:25:07.70

2652
03:26:51.86 --> 03:26:58.02
scenario but are not down for the toxicity sugar and all these bad elements that

2653
03:26:58.42 --> 03:27:04.10
Most of the time come with energy drinks. That's what this is. We'll do cover the energy drinks unless you get these energy drinks

2654

2717
03:32:06.02 --> 03:32:09.62
I mentioned that my daughter kind of drove the

2718
03:32:09.62 --> 03:32:16.18
The spirit behind that and people think I think people think that that meant that she made it

2719

2723
03:32:44.90 --> 03:32:48.34
Be little they're up there getting after it you know what it's kind of like like

2724
03:32:48.74 --> 03:32:52.90
You know when you go to work like let's say you go to work every day and you kind of let's say I don't know you're a manager

2725
03:32:52.90 --> 03:32:56.50
I don't know whatever you go to work every day and you kind of get updated when you go in about okay

2726
03:32:56.50 --> 03:33:01.78
What's currently going on what's the status of this what's it's kind of like that when you when you watch like the YouTube things

2727
03:33:01.78 --> 03:33:08.14
Or sorry, the the origin YouTube channel origin HD yeah, that's the one right or it's an HD

2728
03:33:08.14 --> 03:33:12.98
That's what I watch all the yeah the interesting thing is like if you watch a reality television show

2729
03:33:13.06 --> 03:33:16.66
What they do is they take a bunch of people with like weird personalities

2730
03:33:16.66 --> 03:33:22.34
Yeah, I'm not saying all cases, but this is kind of a stereotypical thing take a bunch of people and then they can fight with each other

2731
03:33:22.34 --> 03:33:28.54
About whatever right yeah and to create drama for your TV show and then people watch it because they like to watch a train wreck

2732
03:33:28.54 --> 03:33:33.18
The thing that's cool about about what we're doing at origin when you see behind the scenes. It's not

2733
03:33:33.50 --> 03:33:38.22
It's not the team fighting with the team. It's like hey, how are we gonna make this work?

2734
03:33:38.22 --> 03:33:41.34
Yeah, how are we gonna get the right materials? How are we gonna get this in production?

2735
03:33:41.34 --> 03:33:46.06
How are we gonna satisfy this this clients that we've got or the customers? How are we gonna take care of them?

2736
03:33:46.06 --> 03:33:53.26
So it's that it's that struggle. It's not a struggle against there's no there's no like a reality television drama

2737
03:33:53.26 --> 03:33:57.42
Yeah, the producer like and this is what they do by the way from what I hear

2738
03:33:57.42 --> 03:33:59.42
I don't like I watch this kind of stuff

2739
03:33:59.74 --> 03:34:04.38
But I hear that they'll be like hey like there's little writers there

2740
03:34:04.38 --> 03:34:08.30
That'll be like hey look we're gonna send these people on a trip

2741
03:34:08.78 --> 03:34:15.02
To the Bahamas and hey you like you got to you got to say that you don't want to go because of what this lady said

2742
03:34:15.02 --> 03:34:21.18
Like last month on Instagram or something like this and you better tell her and we'll just see how it plays out kind of a thing

2743
03:34:21.42 --> 03:34:25.30
See and just like your point though how wack that is well, you know

2744
03:34:25.30 --> 03:34:33.70
At the end of the day, yeah, I agree, but it makes for good cheap entertainment, you know, but yeah, so you watch the origin one and it's like yeah

2745
03:34:33.70 --> 03:34:40.02
It's not scripted drama. It's like the actual drama that comes with running and maintaining growing like a business
