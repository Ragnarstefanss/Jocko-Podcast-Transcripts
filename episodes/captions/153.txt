[00:00:00] This is Jockel Podcasts number 153.
[00:00:03] With echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink.
[00:00:06] Good evening echo. Good evening.
[00:00:11] Congressional resolution honoring the veterans of helicopter attack light squadron 3 and their families.
[00:00:19] Whereas helicopter attack light squadron 3 here and after in this resolution referred to as
[00:00:26] Hal3 began its history as detachments of Navy helicopter combat support squadron 1,
[00:00:33] HC1 which began helicopter gun shipped operations in support of Navy,
[00:00:39] Brownwater Special Operations and Army units in the Mekong Delta of South Vietnam on September 19, 1966.
[00:00:48] Whereas the detachments of HC1 adopted the name C Wolves.
[00:00:54] Whereas Hal3 was officially established on April 1, 1967 in Vong Tau, South Vietnam and was the only active duty
[00:01:05] Navy helicopter gunship squadron in the history of naval aviation.
[00:01:11] Whereas during the squadron's existence nearly 3,000 veterans of Hal3 displayed extraordinary courage in support of United States military and political objectives in Vietnam.
[00:01:24] Whereas 44 veterans of Hal3 gave their lives in support of military operations in the Mekong Delta Vietnam.
[00:01:33] Whereas the extraordinary performance of the veterans of Hal3 earned numerous unit citations,
[00:01:40] including six presidential unit citations.
[00:01:44] Seven Navy unit commendations, one meritorious unit commendation, a Republic of Vietnam meritorious unit commendation,
[00:01:52] and the Vietnam service medal.
[00:01:57] Whereas the valor of the veterans of Hal3 earned 5 Navy crosses, 31 silver stars,
[00:02:05] 2 Legion of Merit medals, 5 Navy Marine Corps medals,
[00:02:10] 219 distinguished flying crosses, 156 Purple Hearts, 101 Bronze Stars,
[00:02:17] 142 Republic of Vietnam Galantry crosses,
[00:02:21] over 16,000 air medals, 439 Navy commendation medals, and 228 Navy achievement medals,
[00:02:29] making it possible the most decorated Navy squadron during the Vietnam War.
[00:02:36] Whereas the maintenance and administrative personnel of Hal3 contributed greatly to the success of the nine Hal3 detachments operating throughout the Mekong Delta,
[00:02:45] providing the detachments with superb maintenance, support, and logistics.
[00:02:52] Whereas Hal3 flew over 130,000 hours of combat and logistical support,
[00:02:59] whereas Hal3 inflicted several thousand casualties on enemy forces,
[00:03:05] whereas Hal3 performed 1,530 medical evacuations,
[00:03:12] whereas Hal3 delivered over 37,000 passengers and over 1 million pounds of cargo.
[00:03:21] And whereas Hal3 was disestablished in March 1972 at Bing-Thuy South Vietnam,
[00:03:29] as part of the Vietnamization program, leaving behind it a combat and humanitarian record,
[00:03:35] recognizing, recognized as bringing great credit upon the United States Navy,
[00:03:40] and its role in a Vietnam War.
[00:03:43] Now, therefore, be it resolved that the House of Representatives won,
[00:03:50] honors the service, courage, and sacrifice of the veterans of Hal3,
[00:03:55] two honors the families of Hal3 veterans for their support,
[00:04:00] three expresses its condolences to the families and comrades of those killed in action.
[00:04:08] And four, recognizes Hal3 as a unique squadron in the history of naval aviation.
[00:04:16] And that resolution of recognition was made in 2010, actually 38 years after the sea wolves were
[00:04:32] disestablished in Vietnam. And that is a long time to wait for recognition.
[00:04:42] And this is because, well, for one thing, they weren't looking for recognition,
[00:04:47] but also to much of the world, the sea wolves were relatively unknown.
[00:04:56] For me, having grown up in the sea of teams, I actually knew about the sea wolves.
[00:05:02] I knew about the reputation from the Vietnam era seals that held them in the absolute highest regard.
[00:05:11] Possibly. Then they were considered extremely courageous.
[00:05:18] Sometimes beyond courageous, they were incredible pilots and highly aggressive gunners,
[00:05:27] and the teams that maintained and kept the aircraft flying in really horrible conditions,
[00:05:33] they were known for getting the job done. And there's one thing that always stuck in my mind
[00:05:37] when I heard stories about the sea wolves in Vietnam. And that was this. Simply, if you called them,
[00:05:47] they would come. And it didn't matter if it was day or night.
[00:05:51] Sunny skies or typhoon rains, a calm extraction or a hot landing zone filled with enemy fire
[00:05:59] to the sea wolves, none of that mattered. What mattered is that the troops on the ground needed help.
[00:06:07] And if you called the sea wolves, they would come. And it is an honor today to have one of these
[00:06:18] men here with us to tell us about this relatively unknown, but at the same time, legendary
[00:06:26] squadron of naval aviation, helicopter attack squadron, light, Halthry, the sea wolves. And we have
[00:06:35] Dennis Rally, Naval Officer, Naval Aviator, and of course, Sea Wolf.
[00:06:42] Sir, absolutely honored to have you on the show. Thank you for coming.
[00:06:48] Jackal, I thank you, and you echo, for the opportunity to be here. It's something that I didn't
[00:06:56] want to do. You know, you hear the old saw about, you don't talk about the war. And I think that's
[00:07:04] true of most all of the guys that I knew and flew in thought with. We just don't talk about it
[00:07:09] except over a beer in a bar somewhere with that. Guys, we've trusted our lives too.
[00:07:17] However, my wife, Stinky, and my son and daughter, when they heard about this opportunity told me
[00:07:25] you got to do this. You got to help keep the reputation of the sea wolves alive. And I don't think
[00:07:33] that reputation needs a lot of build up on my part. But I'm here to honor the 44 of our brothers
[00:07:42] who were able to come on back with us. And I'm here to help share a little bit of history about the
[00:07:49] squadron. And I'm here to thank everyone of you Swing and Dick Gunners who helped me get my little pink
[00:07:57] body back without any additional holes in it. Those guys are phenomenal. I mean, they're really
[00:08:03] something. But we'll get into that. It's a pleasure to be here. I'm looking forward to the conversation.
[00:08:10] I'm still scratching my head is to why I'm here because you guys have giant saw this show.
[00:08:17] You just had a fella who was a highly decorated marine infrety officer. He went on to get a
[00:08:27] lot of degree. He went on to work in the VA. He became the secretary of the Navy. He became a
[00:08:34] congressman from the great state of Virginia. And oh, by the way, it was a little known candidate
[00:08:41] for President of the US. And party politics aside, this country would have been better off
[00:08:46] if Jim Webb had been our president. Totally agree. Yeah. And I can say that not from, you know,
[00:08:52] just a casual reading of his bio. I know Jim because it was a class made of mine at the Naval Academy.
[00:08:59] I know Jim because it was a company made of mine at the Naval Academy. And I know Jim to be the
[00:09:07] kind of a man that I would hope my son would become just a great guy. I can also say that I know Jim
[00:09:16] because for a brief time, plebes summer, we run together. So you're looking at one of the only guys
[00:09:21] that you'll ever meet who is proud to share the fact that he slept with the secretary of the Navy.
[00:09:29] So yeah, we're here to spread the word and have a little fun. The one thing that was really
[00:09:36] important about recent past is a sea wool for union. We have reunions every every couple of years.
[00:09:43] And now many reunions more frequently. But this one was pretty special. It was about two months ago.
[00:09:50] We were gathered on the flight deck of the midway for the premier of a documentary called Scramble
[00:09:57] the Sea Wolves. They had a big inflatable screen on the flight deck. And we were all up there
[00:10:02] laughing and scratching. One thing that I noticed about the entire experience is Manov's
[00:10:09] guys look old. I mean, yeah. But the documentary was very well shot. It's actually being released on
[00:10:23] KPS and PBS. And I assume that shortly after that will be available on YouTube. But it gave us a sense
[00:10:31] of pride. And I think I can speak for everyone that it gave us a little greater sense of belonging
[00:10:40] based upon the fact that our story could now be told.
[00:10:45] Yeah, no, that's a, I've watched it. Anybody can watch it. You can, if you Google Scramble the Sea Wolves
[00:10:49] KPS, the it'll pop up and you can watch it. Just, you know, there's no email to sign up for
[00:10:55] it's free. That's how you can, you can watch it. Let's, let's talk about the sea. Well, let's
[00:11:01] talk a little bit about your past because I think you're, I mean, starting with your, your dad
[00:11:07] being a pilot. And now let's start with that and what that was like growing up.
[00:11:13] Well, my dad would really be pissed off at you for calling them a pilot because dad was an aviation
[00:11:17] or an insurance. And he knew that the guys in the back were doing the job and the guys up front
[00:11:24] were just a steer in the bus. No, my dad William John Raleigh was a hell of a guy. He was an
[00:11:32] interesting man. And that's a nice thing you can say about somebody, I think. Dad was a kind of a guy
[00:11:37] who could walk into a room and full of strangers and an hour later walk out and everybody thought
[00:11:43] to his or new best friend. Good guy, great guy. But he comes from a long line of warriors, my grandfather
[00:11:51] who married my grandmother from Hilo. Yeah, he, he thought in the World War I, I have a wonderful
[00:11:59] picture at home of my mom and her three brothers taken during World War II. And Uncle Walt is there
[00:12:06] in his Marine Corps uniform. Uncle Bob is there in his Navy Blues. And my uncle Jim is there
[00:12:13] in his Army Air Force uniform. Yeah. And then when World War II broke out, my dad and his
[00:12:21] brother, my uncle herb, both joined the Navy. Dad went on in the aviation ordinance and came out
[00:12:28] the other end of the the pipe after peace is one of the last of the Tojo chiefs, a guy who made
[00:12:33] chief in little over three years. He's an interesting fellow. And leadership lesson number one for me
[00:12:43] was the way he helped me grow as I was coming up. You would think that a chief buddy officer
[00:12:51] in the Navy can be very gruff and directive. And they, they can and they are when it's required.
[00:12:57] But dad never told me, go do this. He'd say, have you ever considered, have you ever thought about
[00:13:06] have you ever? And he brought it into practice one day when I was just getting ready for college
[00:13:13] and trying to decide where I was going to go. He had just come back from a mid-cruise and he had
[00:13:19] one of his jails, a pilot, a naval academy grad, inviting me over to his house for dinner.
[00:13:27] I thought that was a little strange, but I was pretty excited about it. The guy came and picked me
[00:13:32] up in a brand new yellow Corvette and took me over to his home and introduced me to his drop dead
[00:13:39] gorgeous Swedish wife. Now dad didn't have to say, you should go to the naval academy for the
[00:13:45] experience in learning leadership. He brought it down to a level that I could understand.
[00:13:50] Yeah, you'd get issued a Swedish wife.
[00:13:54] Well actually what I want to jocco was somebody five, five, nine long straight blonde here,
[00:13:58] good-head bitch and bod. What he completely intelligent and, uh,
[00:14:03] in-beued with a mating instincts of a wild mink and heat. But what the good lords off it to
[00:14:08] pyramy up with was stinky and she's a stumpy little brown here. You're all that's just
[00:14:12] ordinary as a sack of wild cats. So yeah, he needed funny hell at all works out.
[00:14:19] So so you you go meet this pilot and did that, did that flip the switch in your head?
[00:14:25] Well, I always knew I wanted to be a naval aviator. It's just something that I wanted.
[00:14:33] I had initially had dreams of going in and flying spads. That day,
[00:14:39] a one was just a hell of a weapon scarier in that closer support mission that was non-parallel
[00:14:45] in my way of thinking. They got a lot of guys out of the ship. But that didn't work out because
[00:14:51] aircraft was being retired as I was going through flight school. The thought of going to the
[00:14:58] naval academy was always intriguing to me. I didn't know that I'd be able to make that.
[00:15:02] But I was one of the, you know, I'm sort of large. And I was one of the only navy
[00:15:09] dependence who were in the athletics in Kubisaki High School on Okinawa,
[00:15:15] where I went through all four years of high school. And the senior naval officer on the island
[00:15:21] had roomed with Wayne Harden, the football coach at Navy. They did a quick scout and told me to take
[00:15:29] a competitive exam and I'd be considered for the academy. I had a year to waste.
[00:15:38] Well, I was waiting to get into the academy. So I went to Berkeley. This is in the 1963-64 school year,
[00:15:44] which was very colorful. Mario Yoselvo was up there doing his dirty word movement on the steps
[00:15:51] of the administration business. It was ugly. My parents lived across the hill in Walnut Creek,
[00:15:56] California, and every time the news was over, I'd get a frantic call from my mother. Are you okay?
[00:16:03] You're okay? Yeah, my mom. I'm okay. Yeah. But it didn't rate to following that year at Berkeley.
[00:16:10] Every seat of presidential appointment. And even though he had been assassinated,
[00:16:17] John Kennedy signatures was on that. Yeah. And I went back to the to the to Navy,
[00:16:23] fell in love with crew, and I can honestly say that if it hadn't been for rowing at Navy,
[00:16:32] I probably wouldn't have made it through. I probably would have quit, which is something that you
[00:16:37] would have been pissed off about. I would have been. Yeah. And why is that? Because it gave you something
[00:16:42] to focus on, it gave you an outlet. Exactly. Crew is hands down the the greatest team sport
[00:16:50] that you can imagine. If even one person is not pulling their weight, is not exactly in
[00:16:57] sync. The rhythm of the boat suffers. It'll be dragged down. And everyone will know exactly
[00:17:05] the reason for that. You can tell by the size of the puddle, the way the boat is set. It's phenomenal.
[00:17:13] So it's a great lesson in group leadership and that everyone has to be a leader in that shell
[00:17:21] to put their their the maximum that they can into it to make the boat move. If you get a chance
[00:17:27] for you to book called the boys in the boat. It's a great insight into what ruins all about. And
[00:17:33] you guys should be up on other sports. And so you you row at the Naval Academy. How is your
[00:17:44] how is your since you kind of grew up in the Navy, your dad was a chief. You must have been at
[00:17:48] least somewhat prepared for the you know the shock and awe of children's structures and
[00:17:53] upper classmen and all that stuff. It wasn't the the drilling structures or the the upper classman.
[00:18:01] It was the chicken ship. I had a guy and our company that just hated me and he'd stand me up in
[00:18:09] the passageway and they had a plastic baseball bat and beat me in the chest with it. Yeah, it's a
[00:18:16] non-event, you know, funk funk funk. But if I saw that guy again, I would grip his head off
[00:18:24] because it was just so juvenile. I was a couple of years older than my classmates for a number of
[00:18:28] reasons I flunked again to garden. But at any rate it was a yeah you just don't do things like that.
[00:18:34] There's no there's no leadership lessons there's no benefit to be had from some of the stuff
[00:18:40] that was going on in there. But when I got out there on the water with my teammates, you know,
[00:18:45] it all just went away. Yeah, there's something to be learned from having to put up with such crap.
[00:18:52] And I think there's two ways people go with it. Sometimes they go with like, oh, I'm going to be
[00:18:57] able to do that one day and give people a bunch of shit about whatever and some people go, okay,
[00:19:02] I'm never going to act like that. Yeah, you know. Yeah. And then how and and so you were Jim
[00:19:11] Web's roommate, pleaps summer. Just for a few days, but we were in the same company for all four
[00:19:17] years. Yeah. And then he's a heck of a guy. Yeah. Oh, no, it was awesome. It was a real honor to have him
[00:19:23] on here. And you know, he he told a similar story. And he wrote about it in some of his books, which was,
[00:19:29] you know, a guy just smack him in the ass with some kind of bat. It was our song book.
[00:19:35] And and their telling him he needs to say, you know, just admit that it hurts and he wouldn't admit it.
[00:19:41] But same thing, you know, he's like, he, he, he, what do you say? He said, you know, I don't
[00:19:45] hold anything against those guys that did that to me, but I remember the names.
[00:19:49] Yeah. So I think they made the list for Jim Web. Yeah. Um, and then how did you end up pick it?
[00:19:57] So you, you already automatically knew you wanted to be a pilot. Absolutely. And was that hard to get selected
[00:20:04] for that? Um, no, it was a service election is done based on class rank. And I graduated in the top 10
[00:20:12] percent of the bottom third of my class. And that was sufficient to get me into the aviation.
[00:20:17] And since I couldn't fly this path, I really wanted to go jets. Sorry guys. I have to admit that.
[00:20:24] But due to, due to my size, and my anthropometric measurements, if I had to punch out,
[00:20:30] I would have left my knees on the glursile of the trainers that I had to tell you.
[00:20:35] That's six four. Yeah. Big. Um, this was, you know, clearly in Jim Web talked about this one.
[00:20:42] He was on the podcast. You know, he's, he was the guy in charge of hanging up the names of the guys
[00:20:47] that have been killed. And, and yet when I had Charlie Plum on who graduated, I think in 64, or he showed
[00:20:53] up in 64, no graduated 64. Vietnam wasn't even on the on the radar. That's right. For them.
[00:21:01] And for you guys, it, you know, 1967, 1968, it had, you know, you had to have known. Okay, I'm going
[00:21:09] to fight in Vietnam. When you walk into Mother B, bankrupt hall, you go into the Routunda,
[00:21:15] which is a very large open area. And when we started losing our former classmates, the graduates,
[00:21:24] I'm sure Jim explained, but you put a poster board up there with the picture out of the lucky bag,
[00:21:30] and a brief bio and not a description, but where they died. And initially, it was just one of these
[00:21:40] twosies, but pretty soon that the March went all the way around the Routunda, and they had to move it
[00:21:45] up into Memorial Hall. And it really brought home the fact that this is, this is serious. This is,
[00:21:55] you know, you're making up your minds, whether or not you wanted to dedicate your lives
[00:22:01] that the defense of this country, and it might come at a considerable cost. And for 44 of our
[00:22:06] brothers, it certainly did. 44 C Wolves didn't make it back. And I'm sort of an emotional guy
[00:22:16] that one of the few times that I've really cried, openly and then I shame itly,
[00:22:25] was it the wall? So you know, seeing a couple of my gunners up there, just really brought it home to me.
[00:22:39] Amazing people, gunners are. So that's what you know you're getting into upon commissioning.
[00:22:50] And so you get commissioned and you graduate in 68, your classes 68, right? And then you go to
[00:22:58] Pensacola Florida. Is that where you go to flight school? That's right. And that's what you
[00:23:06] talk us a little bit through the flight school path. You show up, you learn to fly what a T-38.
[00:23:12] Is that what you learn on? No, you start out on a T-34. And there's, there's been a change in the
[00:23:19] way they, the Instruct Naval Aviators now. When we were going through, you had to do the flight,
[00:23:25] the fixed wing flight syllabus first before you could get into helicopters. And then you go through
[00:23:31] the helicopter, uh, syllabus. And then after that, those of us that got orders to uh, Vietnam,
[00:23:38] would go up to a Fort Rucker. And the Army would, uh, instruct us in tactics in, uh, uh,
[00:23:46] armament systems, uh, they did, they did a good job in propiness. And then send us overseas
[00:23:53] in the rest of it would be done in country. So the, the training that we received along the way
[00:24:00] was, uh, was excellent. But, uh, a lot of it was just like, uh, back at the Academy, they told us
[00:24:06] that, uh, hey guys, the education you receive here at the United States Naval Academy,
[00:24:11] caused the taxpayer approximately $250,000, which was a lot of money back then. And our reply
[00:24:18] was, yeah, but you stick it up our butts in nickel at a time. So, you know, you know,
[00:24:24] had you, so now you're in the pipeline for for helicopters. Had you heard of,
[00:24:30] see, what's at this time? Were, were you hearing about it? Did, is it something that you said,
[00:24:34] oh, I want to go do that? We were just starting to hear about it. And you know, it wasn't, uh,
[00:24:39] that fully developed in my mind. It, uh, that's, uh, where I wanted to go, but it, it quickly became,
[00:24:50] there is a purpose for every element in the military, from the guys who swabs the decks all the
[00:24:58] way on up. But I didn't want to be a bus driver. I didn't want to be a guy who board holes in the
[00:25:04] sky. So, this being a seawolf immediately appealed to me as an opportunity to be able to,
[00:25:16] I don't know, to pay back. It's, it's a funny thing. And I'll jump ahead a little here.
[00:25:22] But, uh, I have a cousin, uh, who is very close to me. She's a like a sister to me.
[00:25:30] And I'd never really thought about questions like you just asked, but after immediately after I got
[00:25:37] back from Vietnam, she was driving me on out to family home in Wallet Creek, California. And without
[00:25:43] taking her eyes off the road, she said, how can you do it? And I thought about that for just a minute
[00:25:50] and said, well, it was pretty easy. I want to over there to bring as many of our guys home safely as I
[00:25:55] could. And in some ways I failed, in some ways I succeeded. But that's it. I was enough of a student
[00:26:06] to understand the domino effect certainly. But that wasn't in my thinking. You know, you're thinking
[00:26:15] sort of, ten yards, ten yards. But in the air, it's a little more expansive. It's, it's the
[00:26:23] guys that you're flying with. The guys in your flat fire team, the guys on your deck, the guys who were
[00:26:28] the maintainers back in, uh, been to me. They're the, uh, they're the guys you think about. And that's why you do it.
[00:26:36] Okay. So, did you get to select? You get done with, um, you get done with the training. Did you get to
[00:26:41] select? Hey, I want to go to the squadron of Vietnam. Uh, pretty much yes. They, they, was there a long
[00:26:48] list for that. They were, they were. They were, they were more volunteers than, uh, then, uh, got
[00:26:53] to sell. I don't know the mechanics of that. I asked where had I got it? And how did that look like
[00:26:59] showing up in Vietnam? I was the, uh, only officer assigned to the C wolves who, uh, took that, uh, reverse
[00:27:11] freedom flight on and disay gone. And I got there and they shuffled me off to the Anapolis Hotel,
[00:27:17] which I thought was a little unusual. But, uh, uh, you know, I had a couple of days to kill because
[00:27:24] there wasn't any transport down to, uh, to Ben and Tui. And I knew, uh, uh, a deer friend of mine,
[00:27:32] who is at, uh, in debt to it, not Bay. And he'd got over the before I did. So, I figured not Bay. That's
[00:27:38] not too far away. I'm going to go visit him. And the next morning, I, uh, check out a 45 put it in my
[00:27:43] gym bag. I'm in civies. They didn't like us roaming around town in onesies, uh, in uniform. So I, uh,
[00:27:51] jumped on a Navy bus out to Nabe. I was having a great time talking to guys at the debt there and
[00:27:56] learn a little about what's going on. And, uh, come stymed to leave. And it's probably about 1630.
[00:28:04] And I say, well, I better get back. And they say, well, you just missed the last bus. But don't worry
[00:28:10] about it. You can take a petty cab. So here I am, uh, brand new in country. I've got the zipper in my, uh,
[00:28:19] on a gym bag open with my hand very close to it. And this, uh, the Vietnamese fellow is peddling away,
[00:28:26] taking me back to the, uh, the hotel. It took us about an hour to get back there. And, uh, I
[00:28:31] jumped him generously because I'm not, uh, light fellow. I was a lot lighter than. But, uh, you know,
[00:28:36] here I am. My first day in country, and I'm going to get greased. So yeah. It tells us, uh, if you wouldn't
[00:28:44] mind, um, some of the, about the formation of the sea wolves, because it's, it's a very cool story
[00:28:49] about the maycon delta, about the way things, the way the enemy moved through the maycon delta
[00:28:56] and through the rung sat special zone. And there was no roads in the only way to get around
[00:29:00] this water. If you want to, maybe expand on that, just so people can kind of get a feel for,
[00:29:04] for what started this whole thing off. Sure. Sure. The, uh, uh, the mecon delta is fed by a, uh,
[00:29:11] waters from the Himalayas. It comes on down and, uh, spreads out into a broad, uh, quasi-oceanic area.
[00:29:20] Basically, it's mud and crap and brown water. And, uh, hence the brown water navy, but it
[00:29:27] didn't irritate. The, uh, there are very few roads that do anything but connect major cities in the
[00:29:36] mecon, uh, back then. And consequently, uh, it's just about all the traffic's moved by, uh, the
[00:29:43] sand pan, uh, or, uh, or junk. And that's the way people got around. The, uh, infiltration that
[00:29:53] the, uh, the, uh, the VC, uh, practice, came my largely either on foot by bicycle or by boat.
[00:30:06] In order to, uh, counteract that, uh, task force. So, uh, one, one six, uh, was, uh, put into place
[00:30:13] game warden was the, uh, the operational mission. And we were there to interject that traffic in personnel,
[00:30:21] ammunition and, uh, food logistics that was moving down into the Delta.
[00:30:28] The, uh, Army had took that mission on first, actually flying off a couple of, uh, uh, LCDs,
[00:30:35] uh, that were, uh, rigged with a, uh, makeshift flight tech. But, uh, that didn't work out too well.
[00:30:41] And, uh, this is not saying anything against the Army, but, uh, in their syllabus, they weren't trained
[00:30:49] on instruments. In Navy, we were rigorously first in, uh, fixed wing and then in helicopters.
[00:30:55] So we were used to flying in the ship and the Navy, uh, and the Army was not. And, and that's,
[00:31:01] that's because the Navy has to fly at sea land on, on boat, on ships. That's right,
[00:31:07] different missions. That's it. Different missions at the time. The, uh, the Army, uh, uh, uh,
[00:31:12] outrew that, but it was, it was painful. They had it had a different mission than we did.
[00:31:16] So, uh, they, uh, uh, they, they had a unit that was assigned to our op-con.
[00:31:25] And they would fly, uh, cover for, uh, for the, uh, small boats. Uh, that was, we're, we're,
[00:31:30] primarily the, uh, PBRs and the swift boats. We didn't see many swift boats up at Benluck.
[00:31:36] Uh, we were working with a P.A.B.R. sailors. Uh, PBR patrol boat river is a 32 foot fiberglass
[00:31:43] luxury boat that was stripped clean and, uh, was highly maneuverable. But it was, uh, I say,
[00:31:52] stripped clean, everything that was non-essential. They were very lightweight, uh, had, uh,
[00:31:59] little armor at all, but they were very heavily armed. And these boats, uh,
[00:32:04] you talk about guys with, uh, brass balls. They'd poke up into, uh, these impossibly narrow
[00:32:12] canals and up, uh, little riverlets, uh, just looking for trouble. And it frequently came their way.
[00:32:20] So the army was, uh, uh, uh, a, uh, a, a, a temp into a work with them there, where all sorts of, uh,
[00:32:25] a minor operational, uh, problemist overcome, uh, who's calling out the missions, uh, uh, uh,
[00:32:31] what, uh, the support area is, it's just wasn't working well. So the Navy decided that, uh,
[00:32:37] we needed a Navy squadron and they turned to HC1, the fleet angels, uh, to put, put a few deaths in place,
[00:32:48] to help provide cover for the, uh, the brown water navy and by brown water navy, I mean the,
[00:32:53] uh, small boat guys, the seals, any Navy, navy, uh, uh, uh, vessel that was down in the, uh, in the,
[00:33:00] in the me column. And, uh, it wasn't working well with the, uh, the army HC1 picked it up,
[00:33:09] but started working very well, uh, because they understood the Navy's mission much better than the army,
[00:33:16] and they were, uh, equipped with the, uh, capabilities to fly both at night and in bad weather.
[00:33:23] And, uh, I don't know if you've been in monsoon before, but it's shitty fluttering.
[00:33:31] It is pretty worth it. It's really bad. So, uh, as you've already mentioned, on April Fool's Day,
[00:33:39] in uh, 67, uh, they decided that the, uh, in country squadron was, uh, required and, uh, that
[00:33:47] responsibility was shifted from HC1 to Hal-3. Uh, we grew to having nine, nine detachments,
[00:33:55] uh, that were scattered throughout the Delta to, uh, give us a quick reaction time to virtually,
[00:34:00] uh, any, any area in the me column. And, uh, each detachment had, uh, two aircraft assigned.
[00:34:07] It had, uh, uh, two full crews for each aircraft, and that was about it. But let me, let me give you a
[00:34:15] little info on, uh, the noble UH1 Bravo. I love that aircraft. It was a piece of crap.
[00:34:24] It really was, but it, uh, got us out of, uh, out of a lot of trouble every time we flew it.
[00:34:30] And just for people that are listening, that's the classic Vietnam Huey aircraft. That's, that's what
[00:34:37] you see. That's what you see in movies. That's it. Yeah. There really was sort of a, uh,
[00:34:43] Michaels Navy, uh, that, uh, K, K, K, K, that was attached to the sea wolves. Uh, the, the army was just
[00:34:52] getting rid of their Bravo models to go to this, uh, two of the Charlie's, which had, uh, several
[00:34:58] hundred, uh, greater horsepower, a more maneuverable, a blah, blah, blah, and they had, uh, some old
[00:35:04] Bravo sitting around and rather than shipping them back to the Boneyard or destroying them in place,
[00:35:09] they gave them to the Navy. So frequently, we had a lot of rebuilding to do before, uh, we, uh,
[00:35:14] turn these guys loose, but God bless the army. They gave us, uh, the, they gave us our, uh, our aircraft.
[00:35:23] Support for the Bravo and the Navy chain was not the best. So you've, uh, it's easy to say
[00:35:30] begbar or steal, uh, borrowers steal is what we did quite well. Quite well. Our guys were
[00:35:38] incredible. We, uh, achieved grab a couple of guys and go out and come back with exactly what we
[00:35:44] needed. And you don't ask a question about that. You, you just put it into play. Uh, so, uh, the, uh,
[00:35:53] the nine deaths to helicopters in each, uh, each, uh, Huey was, uh, basically configured with two
[00:35:59] seven shot rocket pods, uh, 2.75 folding thin aerial rockets. We had, uh, a pair of, uh, 60s
[00:36:08] that were mounted with a flex gun, the copilot control those, but the, uh, the thing that really
[00:36:14] made us, uh, uh, unique and powerful was our door gunners. When I first got there and just, just for,
[00:36:23] a very short period of time, our door gunners were still firing 60s from the shoulder. And
[00:36:29] that, uh, that was just an incredibly powerful tool in keeping the bad guys heads down during our
[00:36:37] break and, uh, prepping the area for the next aircraft to, uh, to roll in. So we typically have, uh,
[00:36:44] door gunner on, uh, one side, on the other side if we were lucky, uh, uh, 50. Uh, eventually this
[00:36:52] group, uh, got, uh, some miniguns, most of all of our, uh, dead birds eventually, uh, had, uh, miniguns
[00:36:59] and the guys in the back would, uh, fly them and it, uh, did wonders for, uh, keeping, uh, keeping heads
[00:37:05] down as did the, uh, 50 cows that, uh, that we had. Uh, uh, when we went from shoulder here, uh,
[00:37:12] held 60s to, uh, there's a lesson there. Our guys would, uh, it wasn't unusual to see them standing out
[00:37:20] on the skids firing, uh, cover for us. That was a great good thing, but it also, uh, resulted in
[00:37:29] brassing, uh, the uh, sink elevator and the, uh, uh, uh, it just wasn't really, really acceptable. If you
[00:37:37] brass a tail rotor, you'll know about it. It's a rough ride going back in, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, they decided
[00:37:43] that, no, we can't have that. And, uh, sort of tied the gunner's hands by, uh, putting what they called a
[00:37:49] pussy pole in the, uh, in the, in the door and, uh, mounted the, uh, the 62. Well, the guys got, uh, more
[00:37:57] than a little incentive, and decided that, uh, if one 60s good, it would be better, and mounted two,
[00:38:05] one, uh, yeah, here we go again, Hayden, thanks. Yeah, but uh, mounted, uh, two sixties there,
[00:38:13] and found out that they were brassing the, uh, the tail rotor still. So what they did was,
[00:38:19] they rotated each 90 degrees in a, uh, opposing directions, and all of a sudden, uh, the brassing was
[00:38:27] no longer, uh, much of a problem. To essentially the same with, uh, with our 50s, uh, they, uh, mounted
[00:38:33] that so that it, uh, would, uh, uh, fire, uh, 90 degrees, uh, longitudinally, and that was a, uh, a very
[00:38:40] powerful weapon for not only, uh, uh, keeping, uh, keeping guys down, but also, uh, gave us a, uh, a great
[00:38:49] degree of flexibility in the, in the, in the break. And perhaps I should explain, uh, that by the break,
[00:38:56] uh, we typically would fly in a, uh, in the wagon wheel type, uh, uh, type approach, uh, two helicopters,
[00:39:03] uh, roughly, uh, flying, uh, 180 out from, uh, one another. So one is, uh, rolling in on the target,
[00:39:11] as the other is coming around behind it. So when you then break off the target, the next helicopter
[00:39:18] is in their, uh, laying down its fire. And, uh, that, uh, 50 would, would really help us out in both,
[00:39:28] uh, identifying problem areas and taking care of the problem. Yeah, that's a great, uh, a great
[00:39:36] background and, and you know, even when you watch, um, uh, scrambled to see wolves, the just, uh,
[00:39:43] all the footage is just, un, it's unbelievable footage of the way you guys were flying and what the
[00:39:48] gunners were doing gunners hanging out and shooting underneath the bird back in the other direction,
[00:39:54] yeah, who, hanging out by a gunners belt, um, they might have invented the term gunners belt.
[00:40:00] Yeah, I, I was, I go ahead. There, there, there's a, there's a right of passage that, uh, most of the,
[00:40:09] uh, FNG's got. And when I was in that FNG seat, I learned it one dark and stormy night.
[00:40:17] We're flying along in the, and the, the hack, the aircraft commanded,
[00:40:21] diverted my attention off to the left. And when I turned back,
[00:40:26] right here in the window of the Huey was one of my gunners who had moaning me.
[00:40:33] Yeah. So hey, this is gonna be fun.
[00:40:39] That and the, the other was, uh, if, if you were new to the debt as a pilot,
[00:40:45] you were gonna get a colorful brass. Oh. And it was really easy for them to do when they had the
[00:40:51] free guns, uh, I think I got a little more in the front of the later on.
[00:40:55] Ah, that, that's, that's freaking dangerous. It is smart.
[00:41:02] So speaking of fun, one of the, one of the things, uh, I pulled off of the website, um,
[00:41:08] C Wolf dot org is you guys had this thing that you called the Wolf Graham, which was sort of,
[00:41:14] sort of like a sit rep for all the, all the different elements that were out there. And I think
[00:41:20] it paints a pretty good picture of the overall attitude. And I pulled out one of the clips,
[00:41:25] and I'm just gonna read it. So this is your debt debt for, from beautiful downtown Ben Luck.
[00:41:32] The fog cutters of debt for would like to wish everyone a merry monsoon season. Only 10 shopping
[00:41:37] days left. We'd better start with Lieutenant J. G. Who? Why before we forget him. Everyone else has.
[00:41:43] He, uh, he, uh, he, though he was leaving in May, but you, for God to assign a new duty station,
[00:41:51] admin forgot to request a flight booking for him. And operations forgot to inform him that this,
[00:41:55] that his F.T.L. papers had been signed, but we're sure we'll finally, but we're sure things
[00:42:02] will finally turn around for what's his name. Lieutenant Deacon Johnson left on R and R to Hawaii,
[00:42:09] and Lieutenant J. G. Rookie Rich. Uh, can't read the name, par, par, farmer, farmer. Yeah,
[00:42:16] farmer was called into straight now at Ben Toy. Ben Toei, cutting us two, three F.T.L.s and
[00:42:25] Anax. Commander Hammond will still have to fly every day, even after the Deacon gets back.
[00:42:31] Boku map as Lieutenant Johnson is referred to by Mama Son won't be much good for anything
[00:42:37] after coming back from Hawaii. Rookie Rich is talent for hiding should be of great value in Ben Toei.
[00:42:44] Lieutenant J. G. Check Carlos Steel has opened a chain of combination taco stand slash minigun
[00:42:53] exchange outlets with branches in Kuchi, Tan Tan Ann and Ben Luck with others soon to be opening
[00:43:01] long bin ving long and via TN. Lieutenant J. G. Weird Harold Black is still looking for his
[00:43:08] mysteriously vanishing M60 bolts. latest debt for basketball casualty was Lieutenant J. G. Buckett's
[00:43:16] coffee named after his golden touch on the court who got four stitches in his head after going
[00:43:23] for a rebound, who will it be in April? Three additions arrived this past month, Lieutenant Tom
[00:43:29] Rebolla and Lieutenant J. G. Denny Rally, which is user, our new in-country and Lieutenant J. G. Bill
[00:43:37] Belts was shafted shifted from debt eight. Oh well with TV booze and all the attractions of the
[00:43:44] big city, what more could you want? As one of our departed pilots used to say, going home is for
[00:43:50] cices. So and you guys, these are all of I. They're fantastic to read. I read that to my buddy Dave
[00:43:58] Burke, where I sent I sent him a copy of it and he said that's the best set rep I've ever read in my life.
[00:44:05] So you guys had, you know, it's it's good because you know, I always talk and and and every
[00:44:11] vet that comes on here, we kind of talk about how we have fun and that shows that and I guess getting
[00:44:18] mooned through your side window also shows that you guys are having fun. I don't know if the
[00:44:23] hot brass is fun, but you guys were having a great time and you guys were making it fun and at the
[00:44:30] same time man, it was very intense and very dangerous. One of the things that, you know, you, you
[00:44:38] kind of threw it out there, you said, hey, we put these debts all over the place so we could have
[00:44:42] a quick response time. And what that meant was you guys were spread out in these debts so that you
[00:44:48] could get two guys on the ground within a matter of minutes. Tell me about that up tempo and what
[00:44:55] it was like when they scrambled the seawelfs. Well, we had two full crews for each one of our two birds
[00:45:05] and what that meant was you were 12 hours on 12 hours off 365 24 whatever.
[00:45:13] In order to support the the Brownwater Navy, when they got in the ship, they needed us right away
[00:45:23] and we could literally get off the deck in about three minutes and that put us out there
[00:45:31] quickly enough that we could probably get them out of trouble. The worst thing that could
[00:45:36] happen to them in my estimation other than losing someone is losing their engine because then they
[00:45:44] were just out there with they were a grape. No place to go so all they could do is just absorb the
[00:45:53] the incoming and with that in mind what we would do is go on out and try and first get their heads down
[00:46:02] and then two start working the target. We had a very close relationship with the the PBR sailors,
[00:46:11] very close. Those guys were sticking their backs out every day and the times they got in trouble
[00:46:19] we were happy to go and try and extricate them no matter what.
[00:46:25] But one of the great quotes that I saw in the in the history that I was reviewing is the first
[00:46:33] contact that H.C. one made the two boats had gone out on patrol and it stumbled across a
[00:46:42] battalion size element with about 80 sand pans and junks that were trying to cross a river
[00:46:48] and the boats came under obviously intense fire. When they see the sea walls got there a couple of
[00:46:56] minutes after this the incoming fire team lead contacts the chief of the boat and says
[00:47:06] where do you want to put in our strike and he said something like hell. I want you boys to go in there
[00:47:13] and hold field day on those guys and that's where the attitude it is it's an overused term
[00:47:24] but it's a brotherhood it truly is we do anything for those guys they were putting it all out
[00:47:31] did you guys pre-brief with them for missions or how did you figure that out on how did you figure it out
[00:47:41] so did you know where they were going did you know what their target was did they pre-breef you
[00:47:46] unfortunately we had intelligence that was to put a kindly generally a piece of crap it wasn't
[00:47:54] very good for a number of reasons for a number of reasons but what we do is we talked to the guys
[00:48:00] on the boats we know what the tactical situation was in the away and we would know where they were going
[00:48:09] and what they were doing that is going out for a bunker or you are doing an insert with seals
[00:48:16] we'd get that information from the team that was there actually we didn't have a team it was
[00:48:24] just a squad but we'd share the information so we've know about where they were going
[00:48:31] and what we do as soon as we got airborne is head for the the pre-breef spot and then get update the info
[00:48:40] in route so that by the time we got there we knew that where the fire was coming from what the situation
[00:48:46] was with the boats and where we were likely to put in our first strike so the deconfliction as far
[00:48:52] as where you were shooting in friendly fire and all that was I mean as long as as long as they tell you
[00:48:58] hey north north side of the river or something like that is that how you would deconflict and did you
[00:49:03] when you were supporting ground troops how the hell did you know who was who down there we'd
[00:49:07] buy have them pop smoke and that generally worked but the worst thing that could happen is when you say
[00:49:14] pop red and one shows up right where you expected and one shows up a hundred meters on down
[00:49:21] yeah so the bad guys had our head are freaks and I don't know if they had our freaks or not
[00:49:31] but they could certainly see a smoke and they'd pop it also right same one and that could
[00:49:37] create a little confusion but it also gave us a locus points that we could talk to the guys on the
[00:49:44] boats and they could direct our fire and one thing that's important about that the 2.75
[00:49:53] holding in the area rocket was a great tool I didn't like it much because it wasn't all that
[00:50:04] uncommon to have one of the the fins not open properly and then it just goes squirrely and go
[00:50:11] anywhere if you had the aircraft trimmed up it could be an effective weapon but I didn't like to
[00:50:18] use it too far out because that gave it more of an opportunity to develop a mind of its own
[00:50:27] I use it more as a as a close-end weapon so these the you'd be sitting in your in your
[00:50:34] hooch or whatever and you'd be standing by it was your 12-hour shift and then all of a sudden the
[00:50:41] radio call would come in they tell you guys go what was the procedure like from there
[00:50:47] Aswell's an elbows out to the aircraft the one of the other crews first first guy there would be
[00:50:54] suddenly the aircraft was pre-coct but they'd go ahead and set the rockets up for us and
[00:51:07] jump in hit the button and go you every I think that it's safe to say that practically
[00:51:17] every operational mission that we flew we took off over max gross weight you'd pull it up enough
[00:51:25] to get it out of the revotment and get it out there and what we do when we were really seriously
[00:51:33] overweight is just sort of inch it ahead and get a little forward momentum on the helicopter
[00:51:40] and then drop the collective which puts all the weight down on the skids and spread the skids
[00:51:45] and then pop it up a little and the aircraft would be slingshot up to oh about three feet and
[00:51:53] then you know hopefully you'll get across the B-40 fence at the end of the end of the runway
[00:51:58] it was colorful but had to do it in order to carry an affordance to get guys on the trouble
[00:52:07] then I mean when we were in Iraq we always felt like the helicopters which win
[00:52:13] Ramadi the helicopters they wouldn't really fly over the city of Ramadi because it was there was too
[00:52:18] dangerous for them the couple times that they came in it was like it was like a just massive
[00:52:26] machine gun fire at them and they didn't really enjoy that too much but you guys were just
[00:52:33] so my point is that helicopters and actually vehicles as well they're like bullet magnets right
[00:52:39] everywhere you see a helicopter come in the enemy just sees that and focuses on it you guys must
[00:52:44] have you had to be taking fire all the time yeah all the time you get used to it yeah
[00:52:52] what am I gonna say remind me of a the first time that we saw a 51 cal coming at us it was
[00:53:01] night and these things you know it's a big as a basketball it's as big as a freaking basketball coming
[00:53:08] up at you yeah it started to see the pressures come up at it and he says damn you did the right thing
[00:53:15] I said yeah and he said where the collective immediately got down on the deck and then
[00:53:23] came around and we could could adjust but those things are frightening oh yeah that's cut it goes with
[00:53:30] the turf you're 20 years old that was 23 at the time and it's you think the mission you think
[00:53:39] the the pride that you take in the guys and the the pride they take in you and it's frightening you know
[00:53:47] there's there I was terrified at times I think we all were that you you get by that you get by
[00:53:55] that you think about the guys down there who are really in the ship and it's easy to apply what
[00:54:02] you know tactically and get the job done that's that's another thing that that's why I was kind
[00:54:07] of asking you about meeting with the guys in the ground because you guys are doing this and I'm
[00:54:13] sure in some situations you'd never met the people that were down there and you're still risking
[00:54:17] your lives to go in there and give them the support that they need yeah that's what we did
[00:54:26] there's a there's a counter intuitive thing to to helicopters that you just mentioned which is
[00:54:31] when you're getting shot at from the ground if you get lower it takes away some of their
[00:54:36] field of fire right right so so you would think oh there's someone shooting it be I'm going to
[00:54:40] get up and go away when the reality is if you get lower you know that that person there's going to
[00:54:46] be trees or whatever terrain features in between that's kind of take a little bit of time too
[00:54:51] to get your instincts going in that direction yeah it certainly does but it's amazing how quick
[00:54:59] those instincts are developed when you got somebody shooting that you and then the maintenance
[00:55:05] crews the birds are I saw pictures of birds they were just like look like they've been used for
[00:55:11] target practice yeah coming back you go watch that movie a scramble the sea well it looks like
[00:55:15] target practice was used that's what they were using the birds for target practice that's what
[00:55:18] some of them look like and the maintenance crews were just they they said they were making
[00:55:24] patches from beer cans that's true that's true and the guys were proud of that and the
[00:55:32] the patch that was a beer cam would not be painted over generally yeah no and there's one
[00:55:40] thing that I want to say and this is going to sound like a one trick pony in my love the gunners
[00:55:46] but those guys not only fired the weapons they service the weapons they service the the
[00:55:55] helicopters they performed all the daylies they were all qualified plane captains they kept
[00:56:01] that thing up and running for us so that we could walk out with our silkscars and strap the
[00:56:07] thing on and take them out to where they needed to be in order to get the job done no we're not
[00:56:13] air force we don't believe in silkscars I'm sorry air force brother and then so you're doing this
[00:56:24] this is a crazy opt-temp operational tempo of 12 on 12 off 365 days yeah that's insane
[00:56:31] you get used to it you know it's funny I mean you got you got eight hours asleep okay
[00:56:39] then you got four hours to eat and then the other 12 hours you're on standby to go fly into
[00:56:43] into gun battles I got for 365 days yeah I got nervous though when I wasn't flying you know a
[00:56:49] decent aviator wants to fly and it's hard sometimes it's sitting around waiting for your turn
[00:56:56] we played and lifted a lot of weight a lot of volleyball the played volleyball with and against
[00:57:04] the the seals and sometimes the boat drivers it just it was uh 50 meters from the from the aircraft
[00:57:13] and I kept this uh kept this right there so we could respond quickly and then um how often were
[00:57:19] you guys doing casualty evacuation only when needed yeah yeah it it it wasn't a primary mission
[00:57:26] of ours if somebody got shot up and uh needed to lift out the town we'd provide that and occasionally
[00:57:33] we'd uh get a call that uh someone was uh wounded and uh we'd go out and pick him up but generally
[00:57:41] that was a job that was done by some certifiable idiots that I love the uh the dust soft pilots
[00:57:49] you got uh 2019 20 year old kids that are out there given the keys to uh a mazorati
[00:57:56] Chris this was only a Huey but still you get the idea they were crazy they'd fly into
[00:58:01] into anything I had really goes off to them because uh uh they'd fly into areas where they
[00:58:07] shouldn't that's another thing I talked about um with uh Colonel Bill Reader who is on this podcast
[00:58:15] and same thing I mean he just said that the pilots back then and maybe it's because the aircraft
[00:58:21] were uh very inexpensive compared to the you know to what they flying nowadays they they don't
[00:58:27] want to risk the aircraft now but he said he's got they would just fly into like it was it
[00:58:32] hey your your your your aircraft is just gonna get hit that's the way it's gonna be
[00:58:36] yeah deal with it yeah and if you ever got to get the opportunity to read uh the uh some of the
[00:58:44] citation for the congressional metal for uh these are hellow pilots it's it's incredible what they did
[00:58:52] now what I was and I always on this show give the uh same praise that you give to the machine gunners
[00:59:00] because the machine gunners in in a ground combat it's the machine gunners that are going
[00:59:04] to allow you to be able to maneuver and get away from a situation um or maneuver towards you know
[00:59:10] they're gonna allow you to move and same thing with with your gunners and what they were doing
[00:59:15] so you had a gunner on each side that would protect the flanks that's right one of them on either
[00:59:22] a 60 or a dual 60 and the other one on a 50 cow generally or eventually a minigun oh and then
[00:59:31] you guys got the minigun yes I will in I looked at there was a real real fast flash on the screen
[00:59:38] in scrambled to see wolves there's a minigun and it's actually it's upside down you can't I had
[00:59:43] to pause it to read it it said um the Lord giveeth and the minigun take it away
[00:59:51] yeah it was a formidable weapon for uh close closer support yeah for people that don't know what a
[00:59:59] minigun is it fires it fires what 5,000 rounds a minute I mean it's absolutely ridiculous what it's
[01:00:06] yes I don't know what the rate is but it's it gets your attention yeah and it just it's powered
[01:00:12] it's it's powered it's electrically powered so it it actually feeds the ammunition faster than
[01:00:17] then then a normal mechanical weapon could fire but it just it's crazy how much and how many
[01:00:25] rounds I think it's 5,000 something like that it's a ridiculous hell and then you guys got those
[01:00:30] so those were on your birds while you were on deployment that's right yeah as far as the
[01:00:35] the minigun goes you know it doesn't go bang bang bang it goes a buzz at the rate of fire is
[01:00:40] phenomenal and they uh the gunners loved it but you know there's a little John Wayne in all of us
[01:00:45] and I think every one of them would like to go back to the yeah to the free guns one thing
[01:00:52] that I do want to point out is that uh we were not very well equipped so when we were up and around
[01:01:00] you know un-prol or or actually after engaged and had to fly into a gas up and a
[01:01:10] rearm we'd go into an army base because the army had all the fuel and they had nails
[01:01:19] the 2.75 makes a boom but if you can load it with flischets you can really keep the enemy down
[01:01:27] so we'd go on up there depending on the tactical situation if we had a cause it's a
[01:01:36] anti-personnel something developing on the ground we'd we'd load up there and that's where I
[01:01:42] saw my first cobra the snake was an impressive aircraft it was so much it had so much more fire
[01:01:50] power than any one of our huies but where do you put the gunners you know it's for an half-seeding
[01:01:58] they don't have any suppression for a rolling off target other than your wingman and it
[01:02:06] just you know it was intriguing but it just didn't make sense to me do I remember this correctly
[01:02:11] that at one point you're whoever the commander was at the time got offered hey you guys want some
[01:02:17] cobras and the answer was no we we we need to stick with the US I'd heard that story I don't
[01:02:21] don't know whether it's true or not yet yeah yeah we like that but you know one of the guys you
[01:02:26] mentioned in the wolf gram and I will mention his name Chuck Steely up check was quite a guy
[01:02:34] and he would go out on to requisition parts for us at the time the army had a contractor
[01:02:45] dielectron that was doing the uh the work on their aircraft and you know they're bored out of
[01:02:51] their skull when they don't have anything to work on so they got a loach and started rebuilding it
[01:02:58] from spare parts from here and there and got it to be fully functional and you know it to have an
[01:03:05] observation helicopter like that to go out and snooping poop with us that would be incredible
[01:03:11] Chuck engineered a deal where a for a refrigerator full of beer they'd give us this aircraft you know
[01:03:20] it was written off the rolls they'd there because but you know they'd said hey if you have a
[01:03:25] problem let us know we'll come down take care of it I I like to think that Chuck was unplugging
[01:03:33] our refrigerator when the dead Owen C came in and not just know but hell no but yeah that's sort
[01:03:40] of thing was not unusual over there yeah God bus Chuck he did did everybody a lot of great
[01:03:46] service the uh the speaking of beer apparently the the wolf on the seawolf insignias somehow
[01:03:54] based on the low and brow beer can that's what they saw allegedly that's what they said
[01:03:59] I can either confirm or deny you know strangely enough I didn't drink much beer at all when
[01:04:05] I was over there because uh they they seemed to treat it with something that just put the taste off
[01:04:11] we all thought it was formaldehyde that was the the going rumor but man they told us that
[01:04:18] going I was in go on my first deployment they told us the same thing yeah that there was from
[01:04:22] aldehyde that rumor has been that rumor survived from 1969 to uh 1992 and I was on my first deployment
[01:04:30] there was from aldehyde in the beer but how did the beer taste awful and I kept trying to see
[01:04:35] if I could make it taste better but I didn't succeed there's so some of the stuff that you're talking
[01:04:42] about you know from a leadership perspective you got you got guys that are risking their lives
[01:04:49] every time that call comes how how did you did you see guys that's that got to a point
[01:04:57] when they couldn't take it anymore did you did you have situations where you had to send guys back
[01:05:01] to the rear um what did you do when you saw guy kind of start to start to get to nervous to go
[01:05:11] uh this may sound self-serving but I don't care I didn't see anyone in the aldehyde
[01:05:18] and I did not see directly anyone who behaved in a cowardly manner an over cautious manner
[01:05:26] we didn't have anyone that uh was sent back to the to the rear there was a camaraderie that you
[01:05:34] just can't explain to somebody who hasn't enjoyed it it's uh it's an honor to serve with people like that
[01:05:41] and we all took pride in our reputations among our our squadron mates so it wasn't hard to go
[01:05:52] and and that was so clear it when you watch scramble to see wolves it's so clear
[01:05:59] and there's this incredible um they you can see the camaraderie and you can hear it when you
[01:06:05] read through the the the wolf grams you can see that guys are having a good time and there's this
[01:06:10] I mean what what I would consider and you can tell me if I'm wrong but like a peer pressure of
[01:06:17] hey we're gonna we're gonna we're gonna we're gonna do this you know I've I've often
[01:06:22] said that when you get to a good seal platoon it's not a team it's not a platoon it's like a gang
[01:06:29] that you're a it's a gang and we just don't allow for that bad attitude to creep out yeah yeah I
[01:06:41] feel the same way about the uh the uh C wolves and this might be a bad good time to uh share with you
[01:06:49] the fact that uh I at one time after a returning from Vietnam was so fed up with the mission that we were
[01:06:58] flying it was an aging aircraft it didn't have systems that were required to do the job the the uh
[01:07:04] job itself uh was not that important and you know you come from living on a dream adrenaline for
[01:07:12] a year and then come back and uh you're expected to add an old figuratively put your boots up
[01:07:19] on the table one day I got so pissed off the middle of the morning I uh jumped in my Corvette
[01:07:27] remember that uh hey I learned I learned jumped in my Corvette and uh uh Toran up to uh Coronado
[01:07:36] and two of the seals that we operated with friends uh were there and I walked into the office they
[01:07:42] had their LSDs pulled up face to face and I said guys I've had it I want to join up
[01:07:50] and they looked at each other and they locked up their secret and each of them grabbed me by an elbow
[01:07:55] and took me up to the little club in Coronado and we started pounding beers that tasted great
[01:08:01] no formaldehyde there and by the middle of the afternoon they'd convinced me that uh uh being a
[01:08:08] a peacetime seal uh wasn't uh everything that uh that I would expect and that they uh the
[01:08:15] navy had put an awful lot of investment into making me what I was and I could make them far better
[01:08:20] contribution by continuing to fly and I uh I turned my back on my opportunity to find out
[01:08:29] whether I had what it takes to become a seal I'm surprised that those guys um um well I'm surprised
[01:08:38] they didn't talk you into it those must've been surprised they must've I was surprised once they
[01:08:43] got enough beer to them they didn't have you down it down at buds with a log of sand over your head
[01:08:48] is there any particular missions in when you were in Vietnam that that stand out as you know one
[01:08:56] of the ones on scramble sea wolves that they talked about this was absolutely ridiculous they're talking
[01:09:02] about the the the helicopter was the helicopters were there supporting a unit on the ground
[01:09:07] there was no one to relieve them um they needed more fuel they were running out of fuel the fuel
[01:09:13] it's on they're still no one to no one to relieve the helicopters and provide support they say you
[01:09:18] know what screw it we're just gonna stay until we run out of gas and that's and that's what they did
[01:09:25] they stayed until they ran out of gas the other group came in they used ammo cans to refuel
[01:09:32] to to carry once the fire on the ground had subsided they used ammo cans to refuel the
[01:09:38] helicopters that were out of fuel so they could get back to base that's freaking crazy
[01:09:46] you know we never really took time to think about whether it was crazy or not you got a job to do
[01:09:53] and you know that that's probably natural way to to explain it that was the job you went out
[01:10:01] and did that because that's what was expected that's what the guys on the in the boats expected
[01:10:07] of you that's what the uh the seal team that we had uh the seals that we had operate out and
[01:10:12] been like expected and when they call you you go you know that's another thing I think is really
[01:10:20] impressive about the seawolfs is well first of all they took volunteers to go to the job and like
[01:10:26] you said a bunch of people volunteered but the other thing is and and I heard some of the vets talking
[01:10:32] about the some of the seawolf vets talking about the fact that they'd say oh I was in the navy and I was
[01:10:36] you know in the ship and Vietnam people said are you or in the navy or in the ship but the reality is
[01:10:42] people you wouldn't I can't imagine that there was any of the gunners that when they joined the navy
[01:10:49] they thought to themselves what I'm gonna be is a door gunner and direct combat with the enemy
[01:10:54] these are guys that were joined the navy for whatever reason and they end up in that job
[01:11:00] where you know they're doing this day in day out and risking their life day in day out not
[01:11:07] not really what they signed up for and yet they held the line over and over and over again all of them
[01:11:12] volunteers yeah yeah it's it it it it it it it it humbles me to have been able to uh to operate with
[01:11:22] guys like that and you know I the pilot's yeah the pilot's brass balls it was expected it was the job
[01:11:33] the gunners had those balls and then some because they kept us up uh kept the aircraft up kept the
[01:11:39] systems up I had a leadership lesson when I first got there uh that grown up my dad you know he weed
[01:11:48] hunting fish and I uh it fired our we had two uh 14's for each bird they hung on the back
[01:11:58] of the pilot's seat and I taken one on out we had a little makeshift range and uh fired it
[01:12:03] and brought it back on in after I was done and took it in to the crew area to clean it
[01:12:11] you would have thought that I had just stepped on a baby rabbit I mean it was more it was
[01:12:20] plight it was respectful but give me that thing yeah and the guys had that feeling about uh the
[01:12:28] armament you know it this this is my job this I do this so you know it took a little getting used to
[01:12:34] it was easier to let him clean my 45 then uh I just kind of want to you know when you're when
[01:12:45] you're there um you you start to get to know these guys really well and I don't you didn't
[01:12:51] loot you didn't have anyone killed from your debt while you were there is that correct that's correct
[01:12:57] but obviously other guys in other deaths were killed while you were there did you guys have any
[01:13:04] kind of and this is something I've talked about before is Americans and I think it's just um
[01:13:09] because we have so many different cultures here we don't have a good protocol to deal with to deal
[01:13:15] with death and you know other cultures around the world if someone dies you know you do this for a
[01:13:22] day you do this for a day you say this prayer you you go through this ceremony and then you move on
[01:13:26] and Americans we have so many different cultures here that are all mixed together and death isn't
[01:13:30] something that happens all the time so we really don't know a lot of times hey what am I supposed to
[01:13:35] do and I think that's what that's what causes people problems is they don't know they don't know
[01:13:40] how to handle it they don't not put closure on it and so it just kind of sticks around when you guys
[01:13:45] would learn that that someone in your debt had been killed what was there any protocol that you guys
[01:13:50] set up was there anything that you guys did to to try and take that on board and then move past it
[01:13:57] I probably missed out on a leadership opportunity and when guys got killed uh and other deaths
[01:14:05] in combat or even just uh ferrying an aircraft in for maintenance I didn't sit down with the guys
[01:14:13] and talk about it I internalized it and being Irish would reflect on all the good times we had
[01:14:25] didn't think about uh what what went wrong didn't want to know initially you know eventually you
[01:14:32] do because it's important for uh for your trade that uh I just think about the good times that we
[01:14:40] we shared together I lost a couple of the catamacross classmates I lost some great friends that I
[01:14:45] made while I was in country uh when you unfelling I don't want to mention any names but he and I were
[01:14:53] both bicyclists and the one thing that he wanted to do when he got back home was build himself
[01:15:00] the pre-mo bike and uh start to start competing and he never got that opportunity
[01:15:09] and when you when you personalize something like that when you think about the opportunities that
[01:15:15] are lost in a heartbeat it makes you very thankful to be alive it makes you very thankful of
[01:15:25] the two of known that person and it makes you feel like you should redouble your efforts to get
[01:15:32] the sons of bitches that took that life away from them. If that you can help focus your aggression
[01:15:39] and that's a good thing. Yeah no doubt about it and that was um I guess my way again I was uneducated
[01:15:46] no never taught me but one thing I did is okay we're gonna go to work that's the thing that I
[01:15:53] knew how to do that's what I still know how to do is like go to work and you know there's I guess
[01:15:58] you could say there's some uh you know eventually you got to you got to deal with it you got to
[01:16:04] uh feel it more in the future but man when I was overseas it's like yeah okay we're gonna work
[01:16:11] and and that's where the focus becomes because you know and also from my perspective it's like
[01:16:15] you know your guys that's what they would want you to do that's what they would want you to do
[01:16:22] so let me let me share something with you based upon what your guys would want you to do
[01:16:28] came home from a mission uh uh one night we were in contact and you know you're you're decompressing
[01:16:37] and I walk up to my rack and there's this Manila envelope for Lieutenant J.G. Rally's eyes only
[01:16:43] and I feel oh no somebody back on the back home is died and I opened this thing up with trembling hands
[01:16:51] and pulled out and it's a standard navy message and I said hi honey I'm gonna be in
[01:16:57] Tanzanute in three days time come on up in uh and see me uh Sean's mom the love of my life
[01:17:06] call signs stinky there's gonna have anything to do with uh personal problems it's a matter of attitude
[01:17:13] yeah that uh she was a flight attendant for Branough and she was flying freedom birds in and out
[01:17:18] and she had one coming in Ben Lex only about uh 40 clicks south of uh SIGON
[01:17:24] and okay and you know word immediately spread like wildfires throughout the debt
[01:17:31] and my guy is a god bless of these left in a sandbagged bunker or or enlisted crew
[01:17:40] and it was normally pretty ripe but it was also the only place that was really uh that had a
[01:17:46] little bit of privacy well they had determined that I was going to bring stinky on down uh for lunch
[01:17:52] I picked her up in Tanzanute and bring her on down so they had that place spit shot I don't know
[01:17:59] they did it if it was already it turned out to be a bit of a disappointment uh we uh flew a
[01:18:07] flu helicopter on up to Tanzanute and you know we're going over uh bad guy country so uh it
[01:18:12] was armed and I land the thing in front of I know I didn't land it I wasn't flying it but we
[01:18:19] landed in front of the uh the terminal there at uh Tanzanute and uh immediately this air force truck
[01:18:25] comes on out with its cherry top going and this uh this sergeant says you can't land here
[01:18:31] and I put it out to him that we already had and that we're just waiting for uh uh the arrival
[01:18:36] and uh we solve the problem by saying uh listen this aircraft is armed what did you stay here
[01:18:42] and watch it for us and uh we'll just be a little while so we walked on over this big old green
[01:18:48] brand of jet comes on in and and everybody gets off and you know the incoming guys aren't nearly
[01:18:55] as gay and festive as he out going guys so uh they get off and uh there's a gale standing up at
[01:19:01] the top of the ladder just waving that me so turns out she came get off the aircraft but they didn't
[01:19:07] see anything about us getting on so uh you know my crew goes on up the uh the ladder and we're
[01:19:13] in there and gales and elucin into uh the other uh sturdises and they're loving it and uh we go to
[01:19:20] the back of the aircraft and sat there for 45 minutes just talking with each other but when we got back
[01:19:28] and gale wasn't there the the guys were just crest falling they were so excited about having
[01:19:35] somebody there and you know they I don't think the place was ever cleaned again but that was my
[01:19:45] experience of dating my hometown honey in the zone yeah then uh what was it like um was it standard
[01:19:55] Vietnam where just replacements would come when it was time for a guy to rotate out a new guy would
[01:19:59] show up pretty much like I mentioned earlier I was sort of kind of drift at the uh an apple
[01:20:06] of so tell and happened to run into uh got weird Harold who you referenced in that wolf gram
[01:20:12] he uh came just walking through uh with uh the uh death 401c uh Colonel Hammond we
[01:20:19] called him currently was a navy commander and uh uh Dave introduced us and said hey this is a great
[01:20:27] guy we should have him and as a turns out they had an opening and uh within a matter of a few days
[01:20:33] I was in debt four so it uh it was sort of a role your own environment yeah you know obviously
[01:20:39] they put guys into into slots where they needed them but uh the thing that it was fluid
[01:20:47] so then uh your time's coming up to to head home was it was at a one year 365 days
[01:20:52] yeah pretty much yes and then did you I'm you used stayed right on doing your 12 on 12 off until
[01:20:59] it was time to go what they normally do is for the last uh week or two that uh you were in
[01:21:04] country send you into a bend to you for the uh for the uh out processing and we'd fly with the
[01:21:09] sea lords so you know you didn't stop flying it was just a different mission and then you get back
[01:21:16] uh then you then you get okay your time's up and it's time to go home yeah pretty much well you know
[01:21:21] there there'd be a little bit of a party a drunk expert uh but other than that yeah yeah that's that was
[01:21:27] that was it then how was that transition going from Vietnam and then what how many how many hours
[01:21:35] later you're back in America or how many days uh it was a straight through shot we stopped off uh in
[01:21:45] Honolulu there was one other stop maybe Guam and then Honolulu and then home it uh straight through
[01:21:50] and that's a way so you would you married you weren't married yet no now we got engaged on
[01:21:55] R&R and Hon Kong and that's a two-beer story so you got R&R from Vietnam met your
[01:22:04] your bride to be in Hon Kong that's right and proposed uh yeah you know we'd already talked about it
[01:22:13] we knew it was coming got down on any injury me skitching and all of a sudden but it was pretty
[01:22:18] interesting uh when I arrived in in Hong Kong uh we were I booked a room at the building so I
[01:22:26] go on down there and you know I'm checking in and I'm in my uh my uniform so the manager
[01:22:32] happens to be walking behind the desk and says oh Mr. Lali Mrs. Lali is waiting for you in your room
[01:22:39] if you can shit gales getting here to tomorrow what's mom gonna think of course gale got in a
[01:22:46] day early she was in there but you know times were different back then so your transition from
[01:22:58] Vietnam back to America all of a sudden and you were you know people people use the term wild
[01:23:04] west sometimes describe various military situations where it was how it was like the wild west
[01:23:09] I don't know if it gets much more wild west they didn't even see well for Vietnam I mean it just
[01:23:15] doesn't seem the way you guys were running things the way the support that you got or didn't get
[01:23:21] the I mean just the fact like you guys didn't even have flight suits they they wouldn't issue
[01:23:26] them or something like that and you guys were just wearing kind of what you what you could get a
[01:23:30] hold of everything was sort of wild west it took longer to get into a flight suit then it did
[01:23:35] to pull on a no-max shirt and certain bands and frequently it wasn't no-max and as they say you know
[01:23:44] I've flown missions in my 10 runners just we leave our our gear there in the seat and if I was playing
[01:23:51] volleyball and if the scrambles you you don't think about anything but getting in that aircraft and
[01:23:57] getting it cranking so yeah it was wild west and it got yeah and then and then you get back to America
[01:24:05] and you're still in the Navy right yeah how was that well got through train you know first of all
[01:24:14] you're just decompressing that was newly married the galloner getting used to living together
[01:24:20] she's dealing with my unique personality and it was sort of a scramble we partied art it's
[01:24:30] so when we got back a couple of seals one of them had a was connected to a family that owned
[01:24:39] one of the mansions they're in Coronado on the on the waterfront I think that was first street front
[01:24:45] street at any rate just a man it was a beat up old place but it was truly a mansion and they had
[01:24:52] a couple of mattresses on the floor and they had a table in the kitchen but no furniture and they had
[01:24:56] a a taper and we'd go over there and just party like crazy and we're going with this story
[01:25:06] is through all of that time and through all the craziness and through all of the drinking
[01:25:12] uh there was only one person who got hurt as a result of over indulging he ran his car into a
[01:25:22] telephone pole didn't didn't kill him didn't even hurt him very much but that was the only
[01:25:27] instance that I know of and the only casualty we had to alcohol was that same guy who turned
[01:25:35] himself in uh to for a and was uh cashiered out of the navy and then for ten years he was sober
[01:25:47] cleaning sober and he applied to get back in and the navy god love it let him back in
[01:25:54] but more remarkable than that this is one of our pilots now from the sea wolves they gave him
[01:26:00] his wings back and he finished up his career flying well that's awesome so yeah the the point is we we had a
[01:26:07] really great time when we got back and all that was sort of uh a haze but when I checked into the
[01:26:12] squadron after I completed the rag uh learned to fly the the Norr Noble H3 C slug yeah
[01:26:21] our our community officer took me in and uh in my check-in board interview says I know where you've been
[01:26:27] I know what you've done you aren't gonna get away with any of that crap here and that uh there was
[01:26:35] a leadership lesson there I knew that I never wanted to be like him yeah that had to be intimidating
[01:26:43] for a guy though that's taken on these these pilots that have been doing what you had been doing
[01:26:48] and all of a sudden they got to try and reign these guys back into the world yeah I hope I'm not going
[01:26:54] in the too many sea stories but that great friend about the only guy at names I'm using your guys who
[01:26:59] were just ceased but that huge canis was a copilot and we were set off to uh for uh to uh to
[01:27:08] Guam for some uh specialized training and he and I are there in our uh in our uh poopy suits
[01:27:17] at the bar the O'Claub bar at the Air Force base on Guam and we're in enjoying a couple of
[01:27:26] beers which tasted good and all of a sudden this bell rings like crazy and income these guys in
[01:27:34] pressed flight suits with ass gotts and everybody in the bar all the Air Force guys are standing
[01:27:40] at attention this B52 crew coming back from a mission and we're just sitting there with Air
[01:27:47] elbows on the bar and the crowd didn't know what to make of us but uh they didn't get too close to
[01:27:54] a sea there it's a c'mon guys we all have a mission to do and rolling thunder was a very important
[01:28:02] if uh taken to its uh conclusion uh we might have not a flossed that war and I I use the
[01:28:10] words loss and war carefully there and that's not it that is slip of the tongue um they've
[01:28:17] got a mission to do but I mean yeah the war from 40,000 feet and they were they're worried about
[01:28:24] the sands because they turned in it that's I don't want to go there I'm sorry I'd like to apologize
[01:28:29] to the United States Air Force and all the noble men and women who fly for the Air Force
[01:28:33] yeah that's uh actually you know those um when when we got back from Ramadi we we um we got
[01:28:42] after it in a very similar way um for several months I don't know how long you did but
[01:28:48] yeah there was a lot of uh beer and other things that were drank and and I don't know
[01:28:54] you know there's it was sort of uh it was sort of it seemed like the the normal thing to do
[01:28:59] I don't know it seemed like we were gonna kind of get it out of our systems for a little while
[01:29:04] and you know um get over it because it is it is you know it's not that big of a deal I don't
[01:29:11] want to make it sound like it's all crazy but you know you're over there and it's like okay
[01:29:14] it's a little bit of it's it's a different it's a different scenario and you got to kind of
[01:29:19] process through the fact that everything that you just were doing whatever a week ago two weeks
[01:29:24] ago three weeks ago is now completely different but your life is completely different and there's
[01:29:30] no one's shooting at you and there's no one not you're not gonna lose in your guys which was the
[01:29:35] the the weight that I felt lifted off of me about a month after I got home I was I just you know
[01:29:41] woke up one morning and I just kind of felt different and I kind of I was like why do I feel
[01:29:46] I felt different in a good way and what I felt was oh I was thinking about why do I feel different
[01:29:53] right now and and as I sat there and thought about it I was like I'm not worried about any of my
[01:29:57] guys getting killed right now which was the first time in months that I hadn't been thinking about
[01:30:01] that all day every day and so yeah when you come home um there's there's definitely that and I
[01:30:07] I think it's I think you got to pay attention as a leader to everyone in that group to make sure
[01:30:14] that guys are staying within the box and staying within what's what's and I guess possibly normal
[01:30:22] for those situations because you can definitely be you can there will definitely be individuals that
[01:30:28] they'll they'll go too far and that they're they're not making the transition and what they need is
[01:30:32] you know some help someone to come alongside, pull alongside and say hey man let's let's take it back
[01:30:37] a little bit or you know let's let's readjust and you know life's gonna be normal again and all that
[01:30:44] unfortunately the the way we were ruled in and out of the squadron when we left and came back to the
[01:30:51] world it was pretty much an individual effort so that and I also tempered with fact that your
[01:30:58] war was entirely different than ours I would imagine years was more up close and personal than
[01:31:06] than ours the tell you the truth I don't recall ever reflecting on whether my guys were going to
[01:31:15] come back from this mission or not you know it's something that we just all did we all did it together
[01:31:20] and I don't mean that to sound callous it just isn't wasn't part of my thinking and that goes back
[01:31:28] to what cousin Kim asked you know how did you do it yeah trying to bring everybody back home
[01:31:35] yeah I don't I definitely the without question thought about that every every day
[01:31:40] that was the biggest thing that I thought about every day was because there was guys getting
[01:31:46] killed every day basically there was memorial services every day there was you know one of the
[01:31:54] one of the things I've talked about this a bunch but there was a vehicle graveyard outside it wasn't
[01:32:00] it was on the way to the gate to leave Camp Ramadi there was a vehicle graveyard where all the vehicles
[01:32:05] that had been blown up and destroyed by IDs and there was I would say 50 or 75 maybe even 100
[01:32:11] but a massive area and so in order to leave the gate you drove by that you know it was a it was a
[01:32:18] it was a pretty harsh reminder and you know my guys were gone missions I wasn't always going on
[01:32:22] missions because I was overall in charge and there was multiple units and so a lot of times I'd be
[01:32:27] just saluting the guys as they'd be leaving and and that's a worse feeling of like okay you know
[01:32:33] you just you just got your damn fingers crossed and you hope you've done everything you can
[01:32:36] and hope you've mitigated the risk but that was the heaviest the heaviest weight for me was just
[01:32:43] that daily thought every because then there was also there was to fact that there was always
[01:32:49] guys in the field almost always there was almost always one of my you know little detachment to
[01:32:54] guys was out there with seven guys and 20 Iraqi soldiers and there was gunfights going on and
[01:32:59] that's the way it was that was the that was the heaviest thing from a leadership perspective for me
[01:33:07] and yeah so when I got home it took about a month you know before I was like before and the
[01:33:15] the other thing is I didn't well everything that I'm saying about that feeling I was barely
[01:33:19] conscious of it while I was there I was like it was there but I was more focused on doing the job
[01:33:24] it was more focused on it kind of cooked me like you know when they say the frog
[01:33:27] gonna be put the frog in the boiling water you cook it slow whatever you there was like that it
[01:33:32] was more like that like over time it just built up and what I did was just focused on working working
[01:33:36] hard but then when I got home it was like I said it was like a month after I got home I woke up one
[01:33:42] day and just felt like a weight lifted and I was saying what do I what is that what is that and
[01:33:50] then as I thought about it I'm thinking one of my not why do I feel like this you know I just
[01:33:54] had a big smile my face and was you know walking around my house and and thinking myself
[01:33:59] ah this feels good what is this and then I realized oh you're you're you're actually not worried
[01:34:05] that one of your friends is gonna die today which was a which was a totally it's like I said
[01:34:10] it was something that crept up on me and was just there there's just part of being over there
[01:34:15] and felt good to to have that weight come off but you know again I think I dealt with it pretty
[01:34:26] decently and you know did I get drunk with my friends yeah well there was some some significant
[01:34:31] to you bruiser activities that were were were fun and we let off a lot of steam and I think
[01:34:39] that's fine but again you know what worries me about saying that is that there's some people
[01:34:43] that take that as like oh okay now I'm cleared hot just to go and get drunk and get crazy and
[01:34:49] it's like no actually you're not you gotta keep that in check and especially from the guys
[01:34:54] that are in leadership positions hey man you gotta keep a close eye and step back and detach
[01:34:59] and look at the guys and say okay I get it we're gonna let off some steam I get it we're gonna
[01:35:04] adjust back the real world but we need to make sure that everyone is staying inside the box
[01:35:09] and make sure that they're gonna come back out of this thing okay because I mean we all know it
[01:35:14] nowadays man the vet's veterans come home and that's a hard transition to make from from combat
[01:35:20] to you know the civilian world and and even the world that you're talking about going from
[01:35:26] being a sea wolf in the wild west come back to your commanding officer saying look you're not
[01:35:29] gonna get away with that crap here and you know we we definitely had our share of little
[01:35:34] stories like that from to you bruiser where you know guys guys would not quite be ready you know
[01:35:41] as a matter of fact JP to know who is with me at echelon front my brother when he came home
[01:35:47] when we came home he was in another tune got hurt they sent him to our basic training school
[01:35:52] so but he's gonna be a bud instructor and he didn't last very long over there because you can't
[01:35:59] take a guy that's 23 years old that just been through what JP had been through and say okay now you're
[01:36:05] gonna go go and be in charge of training these guys that are trying to make it through but it wasn't a
[01:36:11] good fit and so I just you know luckily had friends and we were able to just pull them over and you
[01:36:16] worked directly from me again getting guys ready for the the more advanced training in combat training
[01:36:21] which he was perfect for but that was an example of where you know I was I had to look out and say okay
[01:36:28] this is not a good job for him right now you know JP's already an intense an intense guy and
[01:36:35] coming home from Ramadhi you know it was it was a tough deployment you know he lost friends
[01:36:42] and as a young kid he wasn't ready to be teaching these young you know he's looking at these
[01:36:50] kids like you know you're you kidding me I'm gonna I'm gonna freaking decimate you guys and so I had
[01:36:55] to pull them over to a little bit more advanced training my brother JP so you get oh so now so now
[01:37:03] you you're staying in the Navy that's it never doubting my mind and you end up I mean you you end
[01:37:09] up doing the anti submarine warfare which is the job that kind of a no is that the job that annoyed you
[01:37:15] we called it also what you were given a mission without the the meanest to prosecute the mission and
[01:37:22] that annoyed me and then and then you went on to become a test pilot is that right correct
[01:37:29] the steely eyed granite jaw test pilot and look at me now so so what is that job like
[01:37:37] it's it's fascinating you know I'm living proof that nothing arms are a person more than
[01:37:43] too much formal education but I get off on that and it was brought home to me once when we were
[01:37:48] having a raging party at our home in protection river Maryland when I was there at the test center and
[01:37:53] most of the guys had have a copy of playboy magazine on their night table a couple of guys have gone
[01:37:59] back to take a leak in our bedroom and found that I had some technical reports there and I
[01:38:05] online and I didn't hear the end of that for a long time but I enjoyed it I enjoyed the the technical
[01:38:11] aspects of it I I often said there are only two topics that are worthy of conversation between men
[01:38:20] and that is flying in the fornication and you know I I I lived to fly
[01:38:28] having said that since I retired I have flown very little but at that point in my life
[01:38:33] it was all about flying and it was a wonderful experience the the flying we did was not
[01:38:41] experimental flying it was engineering flying we test out weapon systems we test out new aircraft
[01:38:46] I was fortunate to to lead one of the three prongs of the the biggest telecopter acquisition
[01:38:54] that the Navy's made when they were looking for the new lamps helicopter two of my great good friends
[01:39:00] were we're flying the uh... secoreski and the uh and the uh Boeing products and they were pretty
[01:39:07] well through their test uh program which took I think about a year when uh bell helicopter
[01:39:13] piped up and says hey we've got one too well they didn't have a a really logical
[01:39:19] contenter but they needed somebody to go on down and leave the test of that aircraft and
[01:39:25] that was me and boy that was fun you know you hear literally or flying the test card
[01:39:30] that takes out to the edge of the envelope and hey are you good enough sure i'm good enough
[01:39:35] yeah just uh don't go too far and don't bust your ass there's there's a lot of uh investment
[01:39:41] that you're sitting in right there that you want they want you to keep in uh in one piece but
[01:39:45] no I thoroughly enjoyed it uh lifelong friends there and just keep me to a story the two guys
[01:39:52] that were flying uh the uh Boeing's in secoreski dear friends one of them was an naval academy
[01:39:58] classmate and he and i flew in Vietnam and uh the other guy Greek is just a wonderful guy and
[01:40:04] still a lifelong close friend well duck uh was unfortunately fortunately for uh
[01:40:12] Hughes became their chief test pilot uh he got out of the navy and was uh flying for Hughes
[01:40:18] and was killed in uh in a horrible uh accident and Greek and uh uh sort of sort of close ranks
[01:40:26] and uh decided that uh we were going to uh try and send uh duck off in good stead so uh
[01:40:37] if you're familiar with San Diego now you know about the point luma lighthouse and the area up there
[01:40:43] that's where the family was waiting Hughes had given us a uh 500 to uh scatter the remains in uh
[01:40:51] that Greek took it upon himself to do this now at this time he probably had uh 2500 flytars
[01:40:58] he knew his way around the helicopter he's in his navy blues he gets in the aircraft he's got
[01:41:04] the cremeins in his lap and they're flying out along well below uh the uh the point on on out
[01:41:12] over the ocean and he looks up and sees the family up there and he's so emotionally wrought
[01:41:20] that he reaches down and takes the lid off of the cremeins well if you've ever been an helicopter
[01:41:26] you know that it's not they uh a very stable place to have cremeins and immediately he said it was
[01:41:34] IFR inside that cockpit with duck every one of her and fortunately the family didn't know what
[01:41:41] was going on and everything uh came out fine but Greek could call me up and said hey uh uh had uh had
[01:41:49] to make mustard today and I said yeah and he says yeah and when I got my blues out I'm still
[01:41:54] brushing duck off of the... so yeah there's ways you uh you accommodate that uh uh i always think
[01:42:03] of the great good times that uh that duck and uh Greek and I had together and I mis-im-sure
[01:42:10] I mis-im all the time but you life goes on sounds like he had to final say about what
[01:42:17] yeah yeah you were OIC during the Iranian hostage crisis what was that like?
[01:42:26] uh that uh was self-made you know yes we were the only uh uh helicopter out there
[01:42:36] that wasn't on the large gray boats to actually fly the mission that could provide combat
[01:42:43] search and rescue uh so uh we took full advantage of that uh got the uh armament that we thought
[01:42:49] we passing through Guam uh I didn't like the side arm I had so I went on down to buy one
[01:42:54] and oh it's gonna take two weeks and it took me about two hours to get in touch with the uh
[01:42:58] local authorities and I had my uh my side arm I'm not going over the horizon which is sort of silly
[01:43:05] you know I mean really uh you're you're flying an over water mission and you need to
[01:43:12] sell any and ever can tell it's always good to be prepared but at any rate uh we'd go out there
[01:43:18] and uh and just train for that uh when we weren't actually out there in in support of the uh the
[01:43:24] the boats uh we've gotten a train for that you end up doing your 20 years um and then you
[01:43:31] called it at 20 is that this how long you did 20 21 21 years and then you went off to the civilian
[01:43:37] sector because it had started working a bunch of various jobs that's right I started out in high tech
[01:43:46] our company had uh a professional staff of 260% of whom were PhDs and I had enough technical background
[01:43:54] that uh I'd go out to a customer with one or more of these PhDs and they'd make their presentation
[01:43:59] and I'd say let me thank you what the doctor meant to say was yeah and I just had it and a great
[01:44:06] a being surrounded by smart people and just is a lot of fun it can be very frustrating at times
[01:44:13] but it's a lot of fun yeah and we have a curious insult in the teams which is someone will
[01:44:22] ask you about a guy and the guy's not a bad guy but someone will say oh you know he's he's a really
[01:44:28] smart guy when you might not be the best most common sense you might not be the best leader but you
[01:44:36] don't use this smart guy so yes you can get frustrated you can around with people that are super
[01:44:42] smart and then fine and then when did you move to Hawaii about 14 years ago I spent five years
[01:44:49] in uh range operations and then they created a new position and for my last five working years
[01:44:55] I was the environmental manager for the Pacific Missile range my daughter when she learned of that
[01:45:02] said dad you hate those guys and I said yes Heather but no I'm in a position to say no
[01:45:10] I just had a lot of fun you know the local environment I'm in community great people
[01:45:16] but they were not strong supporters of military training and that that was uh the my cause
[01:45:24] to help them explain why we needed to train out there and that we were right out to kill the
[01:45:30] whales yeah we were yeah and then how long ago was it that you retired retired about four years ago
[01:45:40] that's retirement has been very very good DJ and I mean I got I got one more quote that I that I
[01:45:52] wanted to read because I know we've been going out for a bit here but uh this is this is another quote
[01:45:59] this is a quote from from a Vietnam seal um and here we go not only does many a seal
[01:46:06] always life to the sea wolves but the units often operated together as a team very often located
[01:46:12] at the same base of operations we developed friendships that are still alive today operating well
[01:46:17] outside standing oper standard operating procedures the sea wolves have lifted seals out of enemy
[01:46:24] encirclements and I have known them to land in a hot LZ to lift out cash is too large for the
[01:46:30] seals to pack out they also evacuated our wounded when metovac helicopters were not available
[01:46:37] most important they were always there for us when we were down in the mud and darkness the night
[01:46:43] illuminated with red and green tracers the VC behind every shadow many times after we were out of danger
[01:46:51] they stayed with us until we were safely extracted in the middle of the river and out of the
[01:46:57] range of enemy fire and that's chief Barry Enoch who's a legendary seal from seal team one navy
[01:47:06] cross for Cyprian and I think that that quote just really exemplifies the the bond between seals
[01:47:15] and sea wolves and like I said it was something that I heard about as a young seal and it's a bond
[01:47:21] that still exists when when I talk to the Vietnam seals and it's a bond that's uh that's always
[01:47:28] going to be there and um all into that do you have any uh you know like I said we've been at it for a while

[01:50:21] just an awesome website so go check it out seowulf.org and with that if you want to support you know
[01:50:31] yourself this podcast etc echo what you got stand path okay stand path talk about jj2 yes jj2
[01:50:40] get a key we know we're getting keys or jingies do we all know that yeah that's origin do we know that
[01:50:47] yes you should know that so go to originmain.com that's where you get your key and rash cards for
[01:50:54] jj2 hundred percent bar none I'm almost tempted to say don't even get any other kind of key or rash
[01:51:01] card I would agree with that yeah boom hundred percent also if you're warming up or cooling down
[01:51:08] or just cruising they have joggers you got into the joggers yeah that's the my son got some of the
[01:51:15] joggers which he's totally stoked on I tried them on yeah just to see it was so horrible they
[01:51:22] are so not not not in situation well here's the thing with joggers depending on how you wear them
[01:51:28] for sure but they're more of a should I put this kind of
[01:51:35] acceptably they're kind of form feeding from time to time right so they're you know they're kind of
[01:51:41] you know so they don't flap around so they're form feeding you in form feeding joggers yeah
[01:51:48] that could see how that could be a violation for sure but if you're not joko joggers most comfortable
[01:51:54] joggers in the world probably in the history of joggers maybe ever origin main origin joggers also
[01:52:01] we got some supplements on there that you can take you got joint warfare which will keep your joints
[01:52:09] intact yeah krill oil same thing kind of universal substance yeah that's the main team
[01:52:22] that I went off the joint warfare for a little while why oh long story being yeah I didn't
[01:52:29] lapse of discipline you know all the kind where I'm like oh I don't feel the pain you know
[01:52:34] enough so I just don't I'm not like compelled as much you know when you you make it like a routine
[01:52:40] no right like that's just the thing I get up every day yeah I take it before I get I take
[01:52:45] krill oil and and joint warfare when I wake up in the morning and before I go to bed at night
[01:52:50] period and destroy every day yeah like you didn't even train that day still the 100%
[01:52:54] joint warfare didn't train that day but yeah well still discipline is not 100% because I don't take that
[01:53:01] every day I take it when needed yeah but I will say I've been using I feel like that's a
[01:53:07] little bit of a crutch right out because I've been using it a lot before just yeah well still you
[01:53:12] can take it every yeah you can but no the joint warfare I like your mindset I think I actually
[01:53:17] think I should incorporate that works just that's just how every day so with the joint warfare I'll
[01:53:22] be like well you know like it'll be in my mind not even necessarily heavily but it will be in my
[01:53:28] oh did I train hard enough to warrant like joint warfare kind of kind of attitude it's more or less
[01:53:35] like that so I wasn't feeling any kind of inflammation or pain or nothing so I was like you know
[01:53:42] I saw it so I skipped it one day and then I sort of you know it just wasn't in my mind sure enough
[01:53:48] and I'm still lifting still doing it still in the game freaking elbow comes back
[01:53:54] because I'd get elbow from you know and I'd get little elbow things nothing terrible you
[01:54:00] just got to warm up more whatever but man it came back just like oh the joint war 100% this
[01:54:06] is just the other day so usually it takes a few days to like kind of get back how's it feel like
[01:54:11] now it's fine but when I started like if I started to do a push up like a close grip push up right
[01:54:16] now I'll feel it probably yeah maybe I don't know because it's been a few days so that's
[01:54:20] joint warfare a good oil discipline and then got milk which is just the food that you need in your body
[01:54:27] yeah that's what it basically is yeah and it tastes good and also for your kids you got
[01:54:33] where your kid milk strawberry and chocolate they're both really good but let's face it
[01:54:38] strawberry is a whole another deal Brian is working on adult strawberry milk will be coming out with
[01:54:45] that can I shoot this about the regular milk dark chocolate is good right like after a certain
[01:54:53] the percentage of what is it what is it what makes dark chocolate better right it's like a certain
[01:54:58] percentage of dark chocolate in life yeah yeah because there's no sugar in it if you just get
[01:55:04] straight dark chocolate right but then there's like 80% 80% that's like the threshold let me
[01:55:10] know if you're doing this way 80% is is good when you get to 72% you're like you're like oh that's
[01:55:16] just a tasty you know you're just eating dessert 80% it's not quite it still give you a
[01:55:21] chocolate satisfaction but it's not like the same. If you eat two squares of 80% chocolate you
[01:55:29] won't desire more if you eat two squares of 72% chocolate you like I'm gonna have a little bit more
[01:55:34] yeah okay perfect so so the the milk with a don't milk my question to you in your opinion
[01:55:42] your juggle discipline opinion if I put a chunk because like last night I put this chunk
[01:55:50] there's this chunk I don't know why it was there was there chunk a chocolate it wasn't 80% in the
[01:55:55] blender I didn't put the whole thing I broke off a little piece so it's maybe like a the size of a
[01:56:00] uh two you know the little baby snickers bars two of those I would say that's how big the
[01:56:06] chunk this block of chocolate two of the baby snickers yeah it was a big munchache those like three
[01:56:13] scoops okay you know like you know the 30 ounce yeah the mugs that we have four anyway
[01:56:21] put it in with a peanut butter chocolate munk and it didn't hand-stit oh yeah well of course
[01:56:26] so the question is is like how much of a violate like if it's 80% chocolate
[01:56:32] or a dark 80% dark chocolate but you didn't put 80% dark I know but that's a sugar chocolate
[01:56:38] no matter what I did I didn't do I'm saying theoretically if I did 80% or more chocolate
[01:56:44] that's good that's still within the confines I'd say you're not the path in the game right
[01:56:48] say you're in the game in on the path okay 80% so if when we come across 80% chocolate
[01:56:54] let's add that just collectively let's add that and see how we all feel about that that's what I think
[01:56:59] check you get the little chips at the bottom of the cup too it's pretty cool check also I just
[01:57:04] talk to a guy strawberry or further warrior kid mulk if your kid is lactose intolerant
[01:57:11] you put him on the almond milk right so get some of that do you get also if you want to
[01:57:17] represent on the path jocquoise store called jocquoise store so we can get shirts hats hoodies tank tops
[01:57:29] more rash guards recommended still within within the confines of being in the game or rash
[01:57:34] guards as well if you want to represent in the wild on the path and in the wild the same
[01:57:40] jocquoise store dot com so you can get some cool stuff all jocquo proved all of it women stuff
[01:57:48] on there is by the way there is counterfeit jocquo stuff yeah but here's the thing about the
[01:57:52] bunch fit here's the thing about the counterfeit once they're like if you all you have to do
[01:57:57] here I dig it like you you'll see a cool design that seems new because that's really the
[01:58:05] what you call it the visceral that's negative right that like the immediate responses like oh new
[01:58:11] design on amazon or wherever these kind of it exists you see the new design so you kind of oh
[01:58:17] cool and you in your in your haste you click on it but here's the thing if you just stop for one second
[01:58:23] you can be aggressive but not full hearty right that's the deal so you take this one moment to
[01:58:29] recognize the design you'll know there's violations all through every single design on there first off
[01:58:35] the font is like the completely wrong font it's completely wrong then I saw one like the good one
[01:58:41] right that's on like you know one of these one of these websites that you can go to and you submit
[01:58:49] your pdf or jpeg and it generates a shirt for you it's like it's a super cheap thing
[01:58:57] so there's one of those not here forget what it's called but it's one of those where it's like
[01:59:01] obviously cheap and the design's wrong it's backwards ours is backwards the good says is backwards
[01:59:07] it's how it's supposed to be there's ones all frontwards like just some person who didn't pay attention
[01:59:12] is trying to do it it's real obvious if you take that second to notice it though so the
[01:59:17] counterfeit ones you know there you go so just look out for the counterfeit ones yeah they're out there
[01:59:24] also do you won't get counterfeit ones at jacquistart.com correct yeah actually actually also
[01:59:31] jacquo it is their counterfeit jacquo it is not so that's not gonna be a lot harder to
[01:59:36] cut yeah you gotta you gotta put some effort into that one yeah you don't have to get labels
[01:59:42] done I would actually be kind of impressed like like slightly just in your mode of getting
[01:59:47] after it would be high level yeah because it's not easy to make tea no not easy make cans of tea no
[01:59:55] it is not easy to the deadlift 8000 pounds unless you've been drinking your tea so you get some
[02:00:00] of that organic too by the way certifying just seeing also subscribe to the podcast if you haven't already
[02:00:09] on iTunes and stature in google play and wherever you listen to podcast because there's a lot of
[02:00:14] podcast apps there's a lot of podcasts too yeah yeah and if you're listening to this one
[02:00:20] tank in a way it's kind of like man thanks well definitely thanks there's also the warrior kid
[02:00:26] podcast which is getting a lot of hype right now why because we talked about it on the last
[02:00:33] two podcasts go here people kind of recognize and they didn't this is the thing I'm not real good
[02:00:39] at the whole like like hey everyone look at what I'm doing that's not really you know I'm like hey
[02:00:46] there's a podcast if you want to check it out check it out so with the I posted it and talked about
[02:00:53] it and so a bunch of people went and check out the warrior kid podcast the feedback is awesome and
[02:00:57] I appreciate it and also if you want to check out some warrior kid stuff you can check out Irish Oaks
[02:01:02] Ranch.com where Aiden who's a warrior kid is making soap on his farm just for real and
[02:01:13] if you want to get some of that soap Irish Oaks Ranch.com that way you can follow the motto
[02:01:19] of Aiden's soap and that motto is stately so check that one out also we got a YouTube channel
[02:01:26] which is called jockel podcast and that's where these videos are of this podcast if you
[02:01:33] want to see what Dennis Rally looks like how tall he is can you tell that from a video where he's sitting
[02:01:39] down he was kind of going out of frame like like sit up yeah so yes he's can't do it yeah
[02:01:44] he's a big dude full of a loa by the way yeah of waifu a loa but yeah if you want to see what
[02:01:50] what Dennis Rally looks like and you can come on there you can also see echoes enhanced videos as he likes to
[02:01:58] call him he thinks it's an enhancement when he adds stuff to him you think it takes it away I
[02:02:03] didn't take away from the message I heard that yeah over that people have actually told you that
[02:02:08] well I don't agree with it I'll tell you what totally changed my attitude is the is the
[02:02:13] mic in the dragon video okay that video is sick the video that you made is it and that video I said
[02:02:21] to myself even this is more powerful even like you know you never really think about what you think
[02:02:26] about it but like the background music like when when it says the king diesness like chelokic
[02:02:32] so to the background of like December yeah well that that is a good point and you are kind of
[02:02:39] advanced in your thinking because really to put kind of to put it kind of precisely the goal is
[02:02:47] it's not necessarily to be like hey what's the background music supposed to be it's like what's
[02:02:51] the feeling supposed to be and then you know I'll certain instruments for music or whatever will
[02:02:56] provide certain feelings and you know that's kind of the goal to line them up that's it so then
[02:03:01] you recognize that so that video has definitely impressed upon me that video is can't have a positive
[02:03:07] impact and positively enhance to use your term what's going on with the words that are in the
[02:03:14] video yeah but what about if I put like the walls crumbling and crashing down see and you see
[02:03:23] that over the whole time you happen to expose see does that take away from you like one of those
[02:03:28] people that got carried away with CGI on that video yeah which I you know you got to explore the boundaries
[02:03:33] yes sometimes you go out to I see on a recent video that I did I'm not gonna say which one but I
[02:03:39] did the same thing but now with crumbling and crashing noises and effects I did it with lens flare
[02:03:44] you know lens flare is right oh yes I do like the goal lens flare somebody puts a light in front of
[02:03:49] the camera yeah well it's the the aberrations or I don't know whatever the word you want to use that
[02:03:53] that a light going directly at the camera will create these like you know little and you can do it on
[02:03:59] purpose right it's like a look it's like an epic look when you get what's called an animal
[02:04:03] thick lens it kind of does this thing it compresses it to the side kind of thing and then when you
[02:04:09] to put in laminas terms basically when you put the video did you do this on I can't tell you
[02:04:14] now we're not gonna watch all my videos yeah yeah go watch all the videos you tell me but here's
[02:04:19] why I don't want to say it because now people will be paying attention to it and they'll be like oh yeah
[02:04:23] you're right because okay not to go into a whole long thing but okay so there's a guy named JJ Abram
[02:04:30] he's a director and I think a writer too but anyway he does he did like the new start trick
[02:04:35] movies did the new start wars you know he's like kind of a sci-fi guy and he got a lot of
[02:04:42] he got a lot people had an issue with the amount of lens flare is he allowed in start trick
[02:04:48] the newer star so clear everywhere I thought I thought I really dope man I really like that look
[02:04:54] but he got a lot of you know a lot of shit for it nonetheless I don't want to be in that same
[02:04:59] boat with these videos with that particular video that I'm talking about so if they don't notice
[02:05:04] then good if so then that seems same I'm gonna go post about it nonetheless psychological warfare
[02:05:12] too which is an album with tracks where I tell you what you should do to push through the moment
[02:05:17] of weakness and that's all we're gonna say about that okay it works with a hundred percent
[02:05:25] certainty I'll add that are you still batting a hundred percent right now we'll get that I'm
[02:05:30] gonna call I'm gonna call yeah you on that oh hundred percent every single time I've ever
[02:05:35] used it recently because it's like are you scared of it I didn't I didn't need it I don't have
[02:05:42] many moments weakness nowadays see I'm like forged in the fire of discipline no transgressions
[02:05:51] are you trying to set yourself up to make a video with flare for yourself
[02:05:54] that's not a good no no no I'm reporting back to you my current status on my discipline
[02:06:00] nonetheless I haven't had to use it recently so yeah I mean doesn't matter if every single time
[02:06:06] that I've used it it yeah it helps like what I'm gonna do listen to you telling me and then like
[02:06:11] oh yeah I'm stupid you know to me just making the effort to open my ears to you is already
[02:06:17] like on the way like power through yeah exactly right check so you know hundred percent on that one
[02:06:25] in my experience also you want to very up your workout on it fitness gear is at on it dot
[02:06:32] com they got a lot of cool stuff on there a lot of good stuff so if you want to improve in hands
[02:06:37] it's very increase variables increase stuff in your workout if it's getting boring or something
[02:06:45] like this got on it dot com gets something from there like kettle pills or rings or battle ropes
[02:06:53] I think if you add one or more of those things into your workout it'll be enhanced greatly
[02:06:58] results wise my opinion my prediction also books what do we got well first of all we got
[02:07:05] Mike in dragons told you about the video go watch the video and then you'll want to get the book
[02:07:09] why because I could get a really good job and thanks because the book is legit
[02:07:14] am I allowed to say that about my own book or is that make me arrogant
[02:07:18] yeah no from what I've been told it's legit
[02:07:21] everyone appreciates book and a bunch of people have now started posting
[02:07:26] reviews on amazon which is very cool I appreciate it I've read them and I'll read some next time live
[02:07:32] but yeah so so Mike in the dragons here's the deal is it sold out at this moment in time yes
[02:07:38] will it be sold out when you hear this probably not actually it's probably we got more books coming in
[02:07:43] getting imprinted it's quickly as they can possibly print them and I apologize for not
[02:07:50] correctly estimating how many books everyone would buy that is my fault and I apologize for it
[02:07:56] but if you do want Mike in the dragons order it as soon as you can so that you can get it as quickly
[02:08:03] as possible also the way the warrior kid books
[02:08:07] way the warrior kid and marks mission those books are good for kids and adults and really anyone
[02:08:15] and you know just got done talking to talking to Dennis rally downstairs and he's like oh
[02:08:20] yeah I read those books they're awesome so he's he's a what I don't know how old he is
[02:08:25] but he's a Vietnam veteran pilot and he read warrior kids and was was down for the cost
[02:08:31] that's weird you said down for the cause because I was thinking in my head down for the cause
[02:08:34] yeah well he is clearly you know down for the cause yeah this may go to freedom field manual
[02:08:40] good one outstanding one actually I think so again and I said this before I'm saying again
[02:08:47] because this is a constant thing it's like one of those things like a manual like an actual manual
[02:08:52] for life but so okay you said that I get it but yeah you refer to it that's what you do it's like
[02:08:58] a reminder and we do this all the time by the way but this is a good one to just remember because that's
[02:09:04] part of the the actually it's the majority of the challenge right there it's to remember this stuff
[02:09:10] like say hey you shouldn't freaking drink a soda right now with your sushi don't do that you know
[02:09:18] that are any but if it's just part of the habit it's like boom you might forget because you're thinking
[02:09:22] about some other stuff you know some edits or whatever that you had to do same so you got that
[02:09:27] manual there this time and you just refer to it kind of maybe even daily semi daily
[02:09:33] I recommend daily daily yeah and you just remember all this stuff just keeps you on the path man
[02:09:39] that one isn't print by the way just plenty of them so you can order that one and
[02:09:44] that's a good Christmas gift yeah for people that you know who needs it in your world you know what I mean
[02:09:51] and I don't think it's insulting well by the way if someone is offended by it just get him to crack it open
[02:09:57] because I'll realize like hey this isn't meant to offend this is meant to build yeah and actually
[02:10:03] you know what now that you think of it that book isn't like extreme ownership might be that kind of
[02:10:09] book that if you get it with something for someone they'll be like what are you sure you know like we'll
[02:10:13] elicit what it called defensiveness yeah but the field manual won't because like first when you
[02:10:19] first see it you're like oh this is awesome just I don't seem saying like looking at it but it's like
[02:10:24] yeah it's like a cool like field manual it doesn't scream like you need to take responsibility for
[02:10:31] stuff that's why I'm here it just you don't get that feel but even even if that person might
[02:10:36] feel that maybe you got to do it with like a certain type of card or something soon as they yeah
[02:10:44] thank you for everything you've ever taught me and then I give it to them. She's insane so that's like
[02:10:51] yeah she act well speaking of extreme ownership there's extreme ownership and there's that I
[02:10:55] caught in the leadership both books that are about leadership and they are available of course
[02:11:01] and those are those are books that will pragmatically teach you how to lead that's all there is to it
