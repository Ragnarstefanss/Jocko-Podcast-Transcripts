I was just it's one of those days like it's bad as it was you know you knew just an inch this way I think we'd done the math before and it was like we came up with like eight inches or something I if the enemy just could move a bullet eight inches over the course of the day like move this bullet one inch this way move this bullet this way whatever they you know what of just killed everybody like when like guys got shot through the his camel back you know it first that it hit like he had a flare in the back there it had done that but that you just inch that Dylan who had the bullet skimmed between his armor and his his gear he moved that I mean like he says in there it definitely it definitely got to the point where like okay this is this is the day uh I don't know how everybody kind of just processed that um I know for me there was a point where I just set a quick prayer just asking God help my wife Miranda and our our son who at the time was a couple of days shy of three months old uh just make sure they're cool with with what's about to happen and then just go back to work and just you know taking it in little chunks it's it's too big to try and think of a week of over the course the day man the four US critical three other US wounded 2k AA about 13, 14, 15 afghan commandos interpreters wounded so you know in just terms of those numbers that's too much to deal with but if I just you know this is the worst thing and going on right now I'm going to deal with this and then come up for air look around that's now the worst thing so you know my wife has you know multiple full-time jobs you're trying to keep those kids you know where they need to be when they need to be there like with the secret service um I can't remember these exact day count but the last year I was like fully able to travel in for the extra level like a hundred and thirty days or something and you know at least well like the military time deployments like you're gonna leave in August and you know we let lower him down the hill and as we're kind of finishing that up like all of the amulatory commando and interpreter cash please they're kind of working their way down through all this as well set Howard and Matt Williams are kind of mentioned earlier like they came through right behind us just kicking off everybody else that had not got the message it was time to go or like CK who would you know been killed they got they got they got him off for us the the I can commando you know just I don't really have a great plan for we got him off yeah he's dropping bombs danger close dropping 2000 pounder I mean it's dropping the stuff and again you know why I'm talking about this as if I know who's what it looks like because I saw you can watch these videos and you can see the bombs hitting in massive hitting that castle and massive bombs hitting that castle and even even the bombs hit that castle they they do damage but that castle was massive and crazy you know we ended up through the course of the day one of our Afghans broke his leg the the wood framing on a building they got blown up broke his leg so we gotta deal with that you're getting just all the other wounds that are coming with those because this is massive debris is coming down on you guys from those danger close hits bomb drops and like debris is coming down on you guys because you guys are below it down a cliff right at at one point I don't remember exactly where in the sequence of events basically I could say we kind of had that wall on our left that went straight up and there was there was a a building there and they were getting in that and starting to shoot down at us and so that had to go away so Zach ended up calling in a strike hit that and you know the cancer fight is not like combat where you get to go punch somebody in the face or shoot somebody in the face and and have that like the the cancer fight is you know getting up and eating when you don't want to eat so last thing in the world you want to do or you got to work out well let's just go for a walk you know like just just those things I just want to you know have a moment to be able to anybody's being affected by that just say you know you're you're not alone and then you know we just unfortunately with it's a little cover as we had for anything like he couldn't take up space where we had cover so we we just kind of had him off to the side a little bit but exposed to the elements because you know unfortunately the living guys didn't have enough space so after checking on him I kind of go back through and obviously this entire time we're still getting shot at you can still feel those spults gone by you can still feel the dirt kicking up you know there's just everything so tight in there and so little space like I'm trying to kneel over these guys to do the best I can't for them and and as things are just falling on us trying to cover them as things you know just rocks are coming down as close as they're happening just trying to get yeah so I of course had heard about the review process that the Secretary defense had ordered never gave it a second thought just what's going about my day-to-day life I mean honestly I think like most soft guys like just to add a boy and here's your next mission that's all any of them expect or want or everything so in August of last year I get the first call on on my home phone because you know you still have a one it's part of that triple play package you know they get you with the home phone like I don't want a home phone they're like because more do not have it like the landline you know the FBI the secret service the DEA marshals air marshals everybody and very quickly on I really just liked the personality like came with the secret service the the attitude that the people had the dedication of the job the focus in a lot of ways you know like like like SF like you have super important mission sometimes you have all the resources you need sometimes you don't you're still gonna figure it out you're still gonna you're still gonna make it work I really liked that personality that came with it so while everybody showed interest in me I kind of focused there so like hey can you come to DC on a top of first because I'm getting them out of the water and like I felt like I had to apologize to them like the team was amazing that day the team did everything and a lot of these guys you know kept going for years and years after I got out like I don't know why I'm getting this and everybody's just hanging on that tiny little bit of the slope trying to not fall off and not get job and the the guys had been shot when they on that slope when they got shot are they pushing up a little bit were you were you somewhat safe in that shot were you in that spot were you somewhat protect your was the guys still getting I guess they weren't because you still guys were getting shot no guys were still still getting shot so we're basically you're just trying to use that tiny bit of an angle to minimize how much you can be shot at there was there was no place where you were safe on there at all if you kind of picture like from from from that little outcropping where we were if you're looking at the main village it was almost like like a like a hockey stick kind of in front of you as the way the mountain kind of wrapped around but he's fine the chest plate did a good job he's he's obviously gonna feel that for a few days so I go back keep trying to package up these guys a little bit more and we're just you know it's it's tough not to gloss over like minor wounds like you know this guy just got more sharp no ones like quick check you're fine move on one of our commandos at some point in all of this another one of our commandos got shot in the head and he dropped instantly and like well that dude's 100% dead and that's when they find about tumors just everywhere what they decided was the primary tumors about the size of a little bigger than a baseball on my left long um and by that point like I started thinking like with all the work that I would do like I'm just getting out of shape like my run times keep getting a little worse but at no point did I think that's what it was so we find out like through that MRI like I'd actually I had a fracture on my pelvis just had a baseball on my lung and a fracture on my pelvis still working and you know I'm not just you know saying this because I'm on your show like I I've been listening to your your podcasts for a long time I I've listened to many different episodes but there's one in particular where you you know you do the book views and uh the a man search for meaning you did that one I think like two or three months after I died diagnosed and that was I mean I like to think I'm a determined guy and like I can focus through stuff so yeah basically told Ryan you're good have a nice day and grab my stuff just start working towards the mountain our team team sergeant Scott Ford and one of the the weapons guys Matt Williams they started organizing a response force to get up there and start flexing a little more muscle up on the hill so there they're organizing that my focus is hey I need to go so you know hit the mountain start working start my way up the same terraced features that I talked about before and you know it is climbing hand over you know hand over hand your literally climbing get up to the next terrace figure out how much are we being shot out right now whereas it coming from where's the next place I can go up and just start working our way up as we went up you know the the other support LMA kind of got got with me and then then next day waiting on results I still flat to actually fly out to San Diego to do to do some more work and that afternoon after I got here he called and he was you know telling us well you have a few different use of word lesions you know once I tell you where is what he's like you got a few things going on your hip that I know normal I need you to go talk to this dock like as soon as you can he didn't even tell me like what the what that dock did but you feel like you kind of are Wolverine like you when you get you know how like me anyway when I get hurt we're like dinged up on like dang how long am I out now you know a week two weeks so I did as I just kind of started pouring that on the wound and then taking my fingers and shoving it into the wound because the wound was so small and three wounds are yeah not big so just started shoving that in there trying to get as much in as I could just repeating that process over and over until I felt like my head enough I don't know just it was just kind of gut call shoving fingers in your body to be like hopefully this will help and wrapped him up as well as I could and so while I'm doing this that's when the lead element started to get back towards us and they were gonna help us start to get these guys out of there and within moments minutes whatever it was of them getting getting there that's when we took our next American cashity John Walding been hit mother right rightly just below the knee basically stampitated is like right away I was hanging on by a little bit and so he meets us in there he's like you know how I run Miranda thanks for coming in we really appreciate it John Kelly wants to talk to you guys so of course Miranda and I are kind of looking at each other like trying to do like Hansi knows like in kind of what where we we landed is like I think I always felt like there was something I was supposed to do and that seemed like it's good a good thing to check a block with this as I could I could think of it's so many different like factors coming at like I there's not a day that goes by that I don't still miss the team so wish whenever I hear their out there like I wish I was there with them I wish I was you know still doing it you know like right now from the global war on terrorism we've been fighting for 17 straight years like green berets you know that's that's where my heart is like they've been just out there getting it on the entire time my it's mind boggling to me that I am the only living recipient right now representing that group Rob Robbie Miller who was in Alpha 33 was on the same deployment as me he here in the metal oven in January of 2008 probably taken the fight to the enemy but unfortunately he was he was the first green beret in this war and now in the second button the first two can actually get out there and share a share my story not so you can be like so is it like a gentleman's course boot camp scenario or for the most part you know coming from from the SF background like I don't know who we need to kick out you got to kick out somebody right just to make sure that everybody else who's here knows like you know it could happen to you yeah you know what else is crazy is I just you know like echo doesn't ever write anything down during these things and you made that statement like probably like 45 minutes ago but echo has just been sitting there thinking like dang but when I was talking my wife you know my wife has been talking to your wife and I said something along the lines of like oh you know what we'll talk about you know and using the secret to the secret service and my wife said in my wife's a Brit so she isn't like fully comprehend American government like an American does we go down back back to the infel point get them the helicopters leave wind in a planning it's some fire base I don't even know where it was we don't know if we're going back there's another SF team there we still got a lot of commandos so we're like back in the game are we gonna go I linked up with the the the medical support that was there refit my bag got got everything ready to go again like we were gonna go right back yeah my wife and son moved out there right away we bought a house you know while I take me to live there I was off a training for several months and then I joined them as soon as I finished up and I spent basically the next four years in Phoenix from May 2010 to May 2014 doing whatever financial crime or so financial crime includes what you have you know you credit card fraud you're counterfitting I need to get your number because credit card fraud people are all about you know coming after me it's like open access and that's what and when I talk to people like like yes I'm still good for my call I'm gonna run out of battery though if you keep calling me the check if my good for my my call or not so a little while later I boss calls back again and he's like your call is canceled like why are you cancel my call and you know just trying to run through all the scenarios you're had like what why are you doing anything with this and I'm getting hired with them a couple months after I got got out of the army and then well what's that on boarding like you go through like a boot camp scenario with them because they must take kids out of college right you're supposed to have like I remember what the book answer is like three years of real world experience after college so from my class you had a mixture some people had military backgrounds some people had law enforcement backgrounds some had one was a lawyer just any different background whatever like with this I like I don't even worry about it just in the game just in the game consistently taking it so I dig it this is what I'm saying well since you mentioned Wolverine I'll say that with my you know SF and then cancer like we spent more time my wife and I talking about the possibility that that phone call was somebody gonna enroll me in the dead we're all okay then with any man else we'd literally like conversations and so I know right away like Ryan Wallen had just been hurt like I just know that right away because before every mission Ryan would come take his squad of the day and stand in front of me and hold them be like this is Ron something happens to me find Ron and he get the next one this is Ron something happens fine Ron good insurance policy But, and I'll part of me just didn't feel like, like, oh, I could be an SF guy because I mean, I grow up just like everybody watching Rambo, you're watching other things like that's what a green beret is like. but and there's like 8,000 pieces of security that someone would have to get overcome for you guys to get the call but some day it doesn't go so we got that going for us but what I would love about that just like with SF is you know to be there you have to you have to volunteer you have to go through selection process you have to go through another school we washed out between selection and the school itself we washed out about half maybe a little more how tight are they you are they on shooting in that school stands are much higher than the general secret service could you might be taking shots around the president you want to throw that round you know what no pressure and so I'm like who now like we can't tell you I'm like why we can't tell you I'm like well that doesn't sound right so go to send me an email from your official dot mill to my secret service email launch it over there will just just verify who you are because you say you're from there or me you're at the Pentagon or you're doing I get calls from them all the time you know we got out of there the the the boss that had basically found out it was you know government efficiencies like that day I was supposed to say the call they kind of went down the hall like does this kind of work for you like I've been emailing you from a secret service email address for weeks now but he's just the rash guards for jits to end of this life and life man you know some women stuff hats all some cool stuff I think it's cool people seem to think it's cool going there you like something get something jock or store dot con Ron how do you like that how do you like the tea is really good Honestly, I think, like a lot of people, I have that two sides of the, the coin, I mean, I have that little bit of dumb arrogance, like I think I can do this, but then I also have that, I don't belong anywhere near these guys, like these guys are, you know, they've been there, actually done that. yeah and is like did you know you're getting looked at for Afghanistan you know is like well just want you to know I just approved you get the congressional Medal of Honor but you know the cancer battles definitely very different than an army battle like again we could just gust earlier like if you could shoot me I could shoot you we'll see this is that kind of behind this scenes unknown enemy and so just you know hearing about like that book but at least I made the shirt like the shirt material it's like you know a blend and all this stuff it's not like some cheap what he call like a boxy rug I was just dumb enough to say, oh, I think I can make a piece of straightening, bring it on, you know, he was too smart to say, you know, he was too smart and then he was too humble, really, too humble because I had some level of arrogance in me and I think there's a difference between, because that happens on a fairly regular basis, you know, special operations and special forces has this kind of mythical buildup where people start to think, well, I don't know if I can actually make it through that, it's got to be so hard. and you know the whole whole thing was just super surreal trying to figure out why me why why not why any of it I remember who's soon after that the the the curl from the Pentagon she called she's like so you've obviously not talked to him you know you know why we're being secretive now like and I just how I described it feels like what you would think that they would so I grabbed a turn to get right out to Scott put a turn to get on his his left arm there's just like a roll there's no where to put people luckily he's of of the serious injuries we were he money he's the only ambulatory guy so basically he's self evacuates down the same side of the mountain that we'd come up and you know where the fire was continuing to get worse but there was there was some guys set Howard and Matt Williams they're doing good work over there and so basically he kind of got down there but like any cliff there's there's a little terrace over here there's a little terrace over there so he he's exploring that route and he comes back up and it just comes to the simple like he's like this will work and we're like he's everybody I dig it what else psychological warfare if you're having if you're having issues a lot of issues or just a few issues on the path you know moments a week this where you don't want to get up as early as maybe you think you should and you don't feel like it that's what it is when you don't feel like it this is a little bit of help to push you through any moment diet stuff wake up stuff workout skipping workout stuff that was a big one for me back in that day by the way um despite this little album black workouts not anymore and so I take one pill every day and you know it's got me two years down the road so the there's ups and downs with it some you know definitely some side effects I think general speaking it's better than what you think of as chemo I know it's pissed off a lot of keyboard warriors and and the sergeant majors out there in the world that I didn't shave for the for the ceremony and I was like well because I had a rash from from my treatment and I remember that I remember that first call I got where it was like you know there's nothing you can do today and and he meant like it was like a Friday afternoon I just found out the day before my wife and I were trying to like brainstorm like I knew about the review process did that even click in your head I think at one point so with the email like the the not subject but like your name So now as you guys got ready to go into the shock valley, what was, did it seem like just another mission, did it seem like all this one seems like it's going to be a little bit heavier, what was your, what was your assessment of it getting ready to do it. and she's like oh look she's just you know getting kind of star struck by the by the office and all all the things but in my mind I'm like you know I don't want to interrupt the Chief of Staff to the President right there with us moving up the hill bringing on those those extra guys and he started I'm working I'm trying to keep these guys alive he starts working that let's get them out of here piece so our lead element it actually made the edge of the village like I think they got into at least one building so they're starting to help we got that foothold like we we made it guys we won it's gonna be CQC us against them like you you actually have a pretty good chance you know well you got a hundred commandos or we get them up that hill you get a foothold in that building it's like okay or in that in that castle we can start taking it out so that's that's impressive man props to you guys for sure but we're like thank you totally insane so at what point did you guys decide okay we got to get out of here or were you still thinking that people just doing this assault up there at that point we were pretty much we're pretty much done at that point so scofford is he in sergeant he comes in like I said he he was you know and then you just kind of get that that cold quiet of an Afghan valley you know there's that little bit of ice in in the water there you know it's just you know you want to use the cliche like it's too quiet yeah kind of so that's kind of like you think how you make like when you when you come up with a plan or correction to a plan or whatever like how you lead people and then she said a lot of stuff about like you know how the process is gonna work and and other things and at the end of it it got to the point I was like man I don't remember thing you just said
