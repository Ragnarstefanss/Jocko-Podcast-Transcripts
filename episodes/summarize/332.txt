Okay, so this is why I remember that because there are other shirt companies that do, you know, like the kind of shirt companies that make fun shirts, like that are knock up, like a, they almost borrow like the concept in the design from like Coca-Cola. This is why I think you know anyone who's going to try and ice bath don't freeze to death, but you know start at 45 degrees and move your limbs around and experience what a lot of adrenaline is really like and you know if you do it appropriately you won't die and you will come out of there. So I started doing my sit-ups and my push-ups, and then I started lifting cans of soup, like, cosy thing, and then I saw an ad from Mike Menser, in a magazine, and I paid, I was working at the time, so I started working at a cafe, you know, busing tables and things like that, and I got a program from Mike Menser, and got on the phone with him, and he said, listen, he got on the phone with Mike. So I took the SAT and by some stroke of luck, I, you know, broke a thousand, which, you know, for gun high school would be considered like the low end, because everyone there is like, you know, perfect as the only score that it was. But it's usually because the guy positions himself below the girl, like he worships her too quick or something like this and the girl's like, oh, he's not like a challenge, you know, dating sounds. And by the way, you're running like a tactical low level, real-time short-term Udalupe for what I'm going to get out of this right now, but at the same time you're running a bigger Udalupe, or you should be a strategic Udalupe that's looking at like, well, how is this going to affect me six months from now? You get this picture head like, wow, every human being should just be running at this optimum thing where, hey, I'm going to go get some testosterone award reward from my dopamine and then when I'm done with that, I'm going to go hug my kids and it seems like we should be in this perfect cycle of where everything is great because we either in pursuit or we're on gratitude and this is great. And that is the one 80 out of what a lot of guys get told right now war is going to make you crazy it's going to make you depressed it's going to make you an adrenaline junkly won't be any way to satisfy and guys hear that and you're going to have a hard time adjusting So you know, I always hold off on looking at my watch, you know, when I'm in there, I'm just going to wait, you know, because it's not going to be as long as you thought it was. So I was like, I'm just going to look at, I want to waste some time, so I'm just going to wall and sit in the ice bath for, you know, five minutes. I don't like you swear you you went to church before as a real good guy after that he was you know screaming at people and call profanities and things like that. So obvious, you know, as a leader that you just have these great instincts and I was kind of like, yeah, you know, it's pretty, I'm really, I'm really good instincts and they kind of inflated my ego and I felt great about myself. And you know, in my mind when I was like 13 years old, my saw that, I was like, okay, that dude looks like he can kick ass. But they like looked at him and he looked like a man, like a jacked guy and they're like, yes. And then you let that go or you, you know, maybe you worked for a little bit of time, you know, like, hey, writing a book, writing a bunch of books. So, you know, that some people are really neurotic about this, like I won't eat within two hours of bedtime fine, but if you get home from work two hours late because of traffic or you're going to not eat and then not sleep, I mean, just be a human. I like this notion of perspective because inability to see throughout the lens of other people is extremely important, obviously, but the ability to return to one's own internal state is obviously that the one of the hallmarks of great leadership, as you know, the idea of groups and how bad things spread between groups is that there's, this will explain a lot of what we see on social media and then the press, there was a set of controversial but nonetheless important experiments done in the 1960s by a guy named Robert Heath. And then, you know, as I started listening to hardcore music and all of a sudden, you know, you, you know, and we roll and black flag is like doing pushups. I was having a conversation with the bodymind that's at a big medical company and we were, I was saying, oh, you know, when my, when my, I was kind of, I was kind of professing guilt because when my kids were younger, you know, I did say, oh, you know, can we get some ice cream Don't you ever do some things like even as a scientist where you're, do running an experiment and you get done and it kind of felt like it was just kind of happening, like you weren't. If I've trained hard, if it's a glycogen depleting workout, you know, hit the weights, then I'll have a big bowl of oatmeal and some fruit, and I make sure I actually like throwing a little bit of butter and some fish oil in there, and, you know, some fats and a protein drink. But I think that's a hell of good is like, like, when you first said it, I was like, wait, what is the reason for that? Like the first time I ever heard like the crow mags, I was like, oh, I, this is what I want to listen to now. And that's how you bring it to the boys hey guys we got to ask for this mission it's going to be freaking horrible the weather is going to be bad we're going to be freezing if that's how you bring it to the boys that that's going to be the attitude all day long. So I was eating and training and just growing like a weed, and as most people know, when you're untrained, and you start training, even a slight, you know, training hard, you just grow. Because people think, we know what the other student feel like going anymore. You know documenting people this really happened to but once people got that idea was like oh that's what we're doing and you see this with a lot of. You know, I'm like, I'm like, I'm not, at that point, I'm, last thing I want to do is get into a fight. Well, I'm just thinking about it because a lot of times people ask me, oh, if I have a hard time, you know, like, I get fired up to do stuff Like I'll see, you know, look at other people and they'll be like drinking coffee. I've had guys ask me that and there's a really big difference is that that you know that thing's not going to shoot back at you, but if you go and hunt like a grizzly bear with a bow and arrow and you mess up that thing absolutely will kill you. Well, interestingly, another thing I will tell people, when they've got more of a, let's say a slow burning problem that they want to figure out a solution for, one of the things I recommend they do is they write down what the problem is, write down what some various solutions are, and what that does is it literally detaches you from the problem because now you're having to think through really what this problem is and how you're going to articulate it on a piece of paper for yourself. DIY means like usually it's done, not like as a favor, but like as a production, kind of a thing. We all know the guy who's got the new girlfriend and then disappears and then comes back six months later, he's like, yeah, you know. But you could have taken like one of those questions that you kind of like said and like do four hours just on that. They know that we're the only ones that can probably be able to get this done we're going to have this opportunity to go out there and get this get this mission done it's going to be hard but it's going to have a big impact. and we're going to have to try and assimilate you back into society because it's going to be so hard because of what you see where is Bob dole or whoever this veteran wants to like a war is going to make me better and I always. You know, sometimes forget the people that do that kind of low income work with kids like me back then, and kids now, probably you didn't graduate school or something. You know, like you can do, you can do a lot of things in half an hour that are going to benefit you as a human being. Yeah, anyway, like I said, and I, I really like Lex and I really like his podcast. And, you know, nowadays you hear, especially in cell comb, but dopamine fasting, you know, the people, I don't even want to look at somebody else's face. Uh, so that kind of brings us through your sort of educational system and what you've been learning and learning along the way and, um, I want to grab some of that knowledge, you know, of what you've learned about, you know, how to be better, how to be smarter, how to be stronger, how to be faster, how to be more healthy. Or let's say, let's be fair, because I, you know, know people, or from being in a lot of gun fights in a short period of time. And they kind of look like, like you said, that's kind of what I think I should be doing. I was like, okay, you know, if you, he's like, you want to expand on that. you know you don't really don't feel like going to work out right now Now if you live in Scandinavia and the depths of winter if you're up in like, you know, try a high mirror or all hooser something like, okay fine. When he was like, and he said, oh, I like the anine, I like it. And then you'd have an amazing bass player like Matt Freeman, who's like a big, you know, card guy. You know, feel like your heart's going a little bit. Looks like a kid at an elastic front show it's just swing is armed like that you know just rage although that's a controlled rage so we have switches in the hypothalamus then we have this real estate that we call the prefrontal cortex which is controls rational decision making. Imagine if you're sitting in a relaxing chair or whatever, you know, that's just going to slip by you and next thing, you know, you've been looking at your phone for 22 minutes or a half an hour. And I remember, like, my friends and me were like, okay, well, looks like we're working out. You know, the first time you hear a gnaz to front, you're like, okay, this is what I want to listen to now because you get that little, you get that hit. goal setting of if I don't do this every day, I'm looking at diabetes and early death, is going to be a much more powerful motivator than imagining you're going, oh, I'm going to be 10 pounds lighter and I can bench press 15% more by Christmas this time of year. I think we got a, he's like, listen, I don't know what you're talking about, this friend's own thing, never been there. And hopefully I can be, this is by the way, this is just like, because I was just, I don't know, I don't know what, what I messed up. Those two things need to be coupled in one's mind and the power of mindset is something that has been talked about all the time the secret or on the you know in social media but I have a colleague at Stanford seems like I only refer to experiments at Stanford And it would be like, you know, you know, his voice just comes from so deep inside his body. You know, I mean, it seems like direct communication is lacking in the, I don't know, I can't remember. So if you were going to, in my mind, if you were going to design a punk band or a band of any kind, you'd have a bullet-belted mohawk-eye upfront, that's Tim, with all this, but like he actually is missing a piece of that front tooth. Now this does not mean that you can just lie to yourself you can't say all of this you know you know four by four from in and out is only a hamburger and it's not going to have a big insulin that doesn't work but what you can do. Many people, when I say men, I mean, for real, like countless, not the kind of like three. And that's, there's going to be, you know, your limbic system is going to be giving you friction about how comfortable you are right now. I'm be honest you know for me I hope for many people there's a strong pull to stay under the covers and sleep longer tell yourself that you know you heard on a podcast it sleeps important. I mean, I don't know what happened with that, but I don't want to punish anybody because I also don't know who it was, but that group or person who made that decision that everyone gets a trophy clearly did not reap the literature about how the neuroscience of reward and the psychology of reward works. I was like, I was like, I don't know. For like 20 years, I have been teaching young seal leaders, and then, you know, other people in the world and the business world and the, in the first responder world in the military at large. So there's a lot of context of this that makes it tricky, but I would say that giving to get is a very dangerous thing, pure giving without the expectation of a reward and exchange for that is great because then both people get to experience that as a positive thing and, you know, giving to get it puts you in a very vulnerable place. So I think we have to be careful of that kind of thing and you you can also then go down the whole road of like a social contagion where you've got people reinforcing. You're not going to build a cyborg warrior that completely discards with the human element because everything that you've talked about in terms of leadership and self-control, all these four brain circuits, and I've been describing the four brain as one thing, like a break on the limbic system. And you know, and I don't know anything like, well, I had shaved head. We may not like limbic friction of the sort like overcoming fatigue to go exercise or stress and needing to calm down but human beings seem to love the feeling of being pissed off just a little bit. I know, you know, but because, um, you know, they're only, uh, some, how do I say this correctly?
