but I I think that makes it easier for you like how you say it's good pressure it's like it's not even it's more of like it it's like it's like a cool little push you know like it's almost like um like you know these celebrities or whatever like an actor or something right where he he has to play Wolverine so he has to work out you know it's like just Twitter Facebook like emails like through the website my personal email like coming in like where's the podcast web and it was probably way less of a deal than then it seemed like to me at the time but still when you get like essentially let's face it strainers people I don't know like just by the hundreds just saying where's the podcast where's the podcast it's kind of like them saying hey where's our where's our dinner you know like where's our podcast So even like even like when you make small talk nowadays, if you, if you kind of see someone and you're like, you're whatever, even your small talk is like, and I'm comparing this to knowing you know, for however long, you can, there's like huge disconnect, like a huge, and I don't mean in a bad way, it's just more like you're, you're doing it kind of in this almost like an official way, you know, where it's like you're not open kind of thing. and you know you see it in people and like like a lot of these things just like extreme ownership like you can see it in other people super clear you know like it's talking a lot of trash for being a loser you know kind of thing you know like you know the old thing where it's like it's like you're skipping all these like mental who's and acrobatics that normal people do on like emotions and habits and like all this like stuff that we have to sort of go through to get there you know because we like certain comforts in fact not only do we like come this like we can sort of need them in a little bit a little bit of a time yourself right exactly right So like when you, like when we're making the victory videos, right, there's so many outtakes like, and most of them are me and you because you're messing with me the way, always messing with me like you're like, there's this one where you're like, because okay, and you, you, you, you're kind of smart you, like you, and I don't mean smart like you're observant. But that I think that those the victory ones, that's how like people started to know around like here around 10 years ago that I did video because I did a series of them and that just kind of, we're like, I just tried to make them like kind of like move you trailer kind of dramatic and no one at that time was doing anything like that as far as like making videos for companies or whatever. but in my case that's how it was so what I sort of discovered and continue to discover like just how good it works it's how good like extra ownership just and everything that comes with it you know like not blaming all the little tips that you'll say like um what is the one where like what do you say absorb and something you know when they come at you with something that happened to them like can you believe like and that's saying a lot because like we have a good we already had a good relationship you know like I was one of these we're like these people who we knew each other before we started dating like we knew it so there was no like you can you can you can you can jam yourself up I think sometimes like if you jump into a dating situation like super early and then a married situation super early and whatever I'm like Devastie, my, you know, my family's there, whatever, my wife's like, well, we weren't married at the time, but she's like, oh, like, oh, man, are you like, okay, like, worried about how I'd handle it, but so I'm like, whatever. so I'm I'm putting all leg covering all leg covering in the world just to say in Delta 68 origin jeans are the best things you can cover your legs with the world is ever known straight out all right that's bold I know because technically and I'd to go too deep to it but whatever so technically you know when you talk about wet suit bottoms and kills all these other things those are like circumstantial like you know there's for certain scenarios right like especially when you talk about what suits or spats or something like this so you're saying at the end of the day net net as they say I don't I don't really like the expression net but whatever net net meaning under the circumstances that you wear a wet suit bottom versus jeans under the circumstances you'd ever wear jeans or the light jeans best 100% cross the board what I just said is what I meant overall in the world which this is 2020 I'm working with Blake because that was, it's like an ongoing thing, which that's what I really liked about like doing video or the type of videos I like to do is like ongoing one stuff where I could like think of like cool little themes for the next one, you know, kind of think. I knew why I could do it not because I have all these cool things to say because I don't really like in my mind like I'm that's not what I'm thinking especially compared to you I'm listening to Tim for that interview Tim Fair like probably I literally could never bring anything like this to the table but if you're over here talking about like stuff stuff and and I have just little detailed questions about that just to clarify what you're saying or whatever like I think that I could facilitate in that way and not to mention just technically I could make the whole thing happen and I have my own little creative ideas as well with that and then there's like how do you say that thought right like how do you how do you articulate your thoughts right and to expect or to think that like if you have a thought it'll be perfectly articulated or whatever those don't go hand in hand you know some people are super good at it like in fact you're like you're one of the better people that I've witnessed anyway that at that probably you know probably because he keeps things pretty simple most of the time and he's like kind of like how Jamie did me long time ago he's like bro do the geek because this geek competition is your brown belt test straight up told me because he wanted to just tell me like cool one I won the purple belt got hurt in the nogie no purple belt years and years and years ago by no purple belt so same deal man like right before that was he told you brown belt or purple belt I was a purple belt that was the that geek competition but yeah if you're gonna go down the whole of like hey let's debate this hot controversial topic you know it's hard for me to to to to reflect on that in a positive way you know it's a card for me to look at someone go man this is what you you know you just sent out nine tweets like linked here you can link tweets together and someone will send out nine tweets about some topic and it just worries me because I think there's more productive things that people could do with their time like if you want to put those things together and organize the way and you want to make those statements and and almost always they're attacking like in a super aggressive personal attack as well so anyways it's just interesting yeah it's a lot like the words say what they say but like the fact that those words are there like says a whole another thing you know you know the old nothing new where it's like man you don't have anything better to do than to like express that like yeah like these people want to like promote you but then jockel like doesn't you know kind of thing then I'd be then that when I think about it'd be like I think to myself okay it just seemed like with Andy and whether this was the case or I just seems like this could be a possibility in this type of equation where they rise so fast and they get so good so fast that it's like bro like I have no choice but to give this guy a black belt sure he's straight up he's tapping me out and I've been a black belt for 15 years you know it's it's kind of like that kind of attitude but I started to do more ghee and then I got hurt like at the end of purple belt and you know people were starting to look at me like hey when are you getting to get your brown belt then it started getting introduced to me so then my mindset kind of started to shift then I stopped competing too so now like just competing to win wasn't really part of it it was it was of all about walking in the training room or this corrupting the moment into my mind so walking the training room you know I'm a purple belt but I've been a purple belt for a while so like I want to be a brown belt it's a I'm like maybe 60% maybe 50% detached because I'm like I'm the audience member just like everybody else really like when you're talking about stuff and or when you're interviewing someone like man I'm enjoying the show like everybody else exactly like a little assistant like shit or am I saying the right thing you know or did that sound dumb it's like it's just a constant like small like humming evaluation kind of process that's going on you always think back on things like you should handle things or whatever so so moving up in ranks and and I say this kind in a way as it advice to maybe people who can fall into these psychological traps with the belt right they want to belt they want that stripe or the blue belt or the purple you know they want they want to get promoted right because they want to wear part of it is because they want to wear that belt and it doesn't keep in mind it does not help you just do doesn't help you just do this not that currently does not help this particular situation where you know when and our school I like you're saying I thought you're saying it does not help like There's not a bit, you know, like, we're in this arena, you know, it's like, we're in a Jiu-Jitsu, everyone's competing, and it's like, you know, it's so not a big deal at the end of the day, but it feels like a huge deal, you know. okay like I shouldn't even have asked you because that's essentially in a way it's not really what I'm asking like I know that part like how do I get there how do I make that part like more accessible or that ability more accessible to to myself that's kind of what they're asking but mean well like I'm watching you do all these things and then the other side is like man the it's almost like logical where man who would you rather be like a medium or not so good black belt or like the best brown belt like who would you what as far as that kind of thinking goes in this thing it's but keep in mind too though I'm like the opposite of you in this way where I'm like like way more like hesitant like I'm also worried about that you know probably to the point where I shouldn't be worried about yeah like how we're talking yesterday whatever it's like it doesn't really change anything you know like just goes with my belt happens to be a different color it's like you're as good as you are you know that doesn't make your ginger ginger game but I really don't feel like it you know like that's just a given I don't feel like like that's like given part of the equation so then what I would do is I just sort of rolled into it casually because you know like certain move like movie start in all kind of different ways you know some movie start just the way how you were saying like you want to start like it begins and and that rabbit hole of like revelations like that is is endless keeps like going and going and going and and certain things you sort of forget to you know because you know a human being we're all human beings with habits and stuff like that you came off as like insensitive or you don't understand or or your races or you're you know like all these interpretations that seem like reasonable interpretations given the words that you said but it's like man that was just I shouldn't have said it that way because it's not quite as accurate as what I think you know so it kind of like it really felt like and in a lot of ways it still does feel like we were sort of all in this together like everyone like me knew doing it but I didn't you know I didn't if you remember if you even think about it right now you know we don't like especially like creative stuff like you don't we don't really talk about you're just like you just do it
