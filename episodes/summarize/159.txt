and you can walk the terrain and really understand what the visibility is like that's the kind of that's that's you should you gotta take advantage of those tools you got to understand the terrain you got to understand the terrain that you're going into in the business world you go gotta go into a company understanding what the situation is there when you get hired into a new company you want to know the terrain you want to know who's got the clouds you know you want to know who the movers and shakers are you want to know what things are off limits in whatever you don't know who's buying like you know people they you know people we say this was a billion dollar industry right like that kind of stuff I think you see it like kind of like I said like when you go up in like skill like you're going to the pros or whatever trick plays don't work is good they have to be really advanced trick plays that's when you have you've seen like the trick play that like where they like almost walk off the field anyway it would always work is the reverse it's essentially like you do a sweet everyone's running this way to block for this running back everyone except for the one tight-end or the whiter's coming this way and the running back hands it off the him going this way so he's full speed running this way so everyone has to change direction to chase them and usually that side of fields wide open it works way better in pop Warner and younger teams because they don't like these these situations like they don't know they just see everyone running there and they just sort of go you know more than a professional they're gonna be like wait I shouldn't have just been you know Never lead your soldiers into an engagement unless you are assured of their courage and then he actually says unless you know them to be without fear which is a stretch in my mind because you're gonna have people they're gonna be afraid in fact when you can you you're gonna people are gonna be afraid when they're going into combat 90 something percent a high percentage of people are gonna have some level of fear but you do need to make sure that they're gonna be able to overcome that fear so if you got people that are shaken in their shoes and they feel you know you think they're gonna do not they're not been tested at all well then that could be a real problem then then the question becomes okay because you look like a seal like I like a sea animal seal so that's what you do you put people in situations where they're gonna be afraid you know and this is something that I think everyone should do if you have a job that's gonna cost stress you want to put people in stressful situations so that's how you test that fear and again you're not gonna be able to remove the fear from people what you want to figure out is can they overcome the fear that's what you want to figure out what else you say no that they're organized never making attempt unless you unless you see they hope for victory yes so this is what it seemed like it's fast but this is what it's looked like where cyborg landed like a solid one and a man in Nunes as a response unleashed fury like some legit fury fury but it was discipline fury because when she started landing hard once she didn't like over commit it was like really balanced you know she looked great and we're gonna make bad luck for the enemy we're gonna dry up rivers we're gonna damn rivers so they can't grow food that's what we're gonna do so we're gonna cut off supply chains that's what we're gonna do we're gonna make a we're gonna make fortune favor us number five no purpose is better than that which is hidden from the enemy until you've executed it boom pretty straightforward no plan is better than that which you have concealed from the enemy until the time you execute it it's no doubt true in life true in business true in jiu jitsu that's what just essentially the element of supply of the surprise if you if you if you if your enemy doesn't know what you're gonna do yeah you can kind of tell when like you see like they're they're uh feet when they're you know third punch is like you could there's like a huge forward lean if they're haymakers there's like the huge forward lean There's a a terrible feeling in the gut that I've only felt while I was overseas in in Iraq and it's it's this deeply distressed kind of sick feeling and it literally feel it and you're gut literally feel it in your stomach and my stomach and it's not it's not the fear it's not fear it's not it's not the fear of death because when you get to a point when you kind of accept that death is a possibility and you're okay with it then that fear kind of goes away and it's not the fear of one of your guys being wounded or killed it's not that either because even that fear even that fear you you kind of get a control of that fear because you know you can't dwell on it because you know if you do well on the fear of one of your guys getting wounded or getting killed then that's going to detract from the very thing that you're supposed to be doing that will most likely prevent your guys from being wounded or killed if you're dwelling on that fear you won't be doing the things you should be doing like planning and training and preparing and inspecting and reviewing and leading so even that fear while it's persistent and heavy and potent it's you have some level of control over it well you don't want to be all militant and impose discipline on your kids and make them number one reliant on your discipline instead of their discipline I don't want to you don't want anyone like that you don't want your team to be like that whether reliant on you barking at them to tell them what to do you don't want that then they can't function for themselves you don't want your kids to be that way either your kids to think you know what I need to make a good decision I could slack off or I could do what I'm supposed to do I'm gonna do it right it's an echo chamber I like going to you know to those people in the in the sea suite of blockbuster like you know my wife loves going down and picking out a movie with the kids they love doing that you know there's someone's yeah this is just detached decentralized command next up 22 cause that enemies cause that the enemies know not how thou right order thy army to fight and in what so ever manner that thou or dane stint make that the first band be received of the second and the third middle English get something what we talking about here well cause your enemies know not so that means you don't want your enemies to understand how you're gonna organize your your army to fight that's what this is you you want a confusion you don't want them to know exactly what you're going to do make them strong now make them work hard that will absolutely increase their bravery remember that question we got asked a while ago about how do I make my unit guys in military military how do I make them proud how I increase their level pride train hard they will get physically stronger they will get mentally stronger and from that they will start to take pride in themselves and pride in themselves as a unit hey discipline may do more in war than fury figure need like yeah kind of like that one discipline counts more than fury in war discipline counts more than fury in life I'm not discounting emotions I'm not doing that because you can't because sometimes man people's emotions they get they will carry them through a really tough time period that's why in discipline it was freedom in the field manual I talk about how you got to use both it's logic well I should say lack of leadership inside the organization so if you have a if you have a problem hanging on to people in your organization it's most likely a leadership problem not a comp problem not a midlife crisis problem for the employee it's a leadership problem because good good people will stay with good leaders and if there's not good leaders they're looking for another job they're looking for another way they're looking for another opportunity leadership leadership leadership gets on number ten better it is in pitching the field to reserve behind the first front aid enough then to make the front bigger to disperse the soldiers what that saying is it's better to keep your reserves just behind the keep some reserves just behind the front lines rather than spread out your reserves and take on a bigger front trying hold more areas better to you know this is prioritize next keep your keep your focus of effort even with your reserves keep folks of effort keep them consolidated so you can utilize them well next up number eleven he is difficulty overcome which can know his own power and the same of the enemy like oh is it you know how's the what's the need for your product i'm remembering because they want shark tank this is what they always ask what what was the what was this a particular product it's not an average everyone like pretty much that's one of the things like they ask or they say they'll be like and you know that's kind of it usually refers to his book the prince and usually that word nowadays is used to describe someone that's kind of scheming and unscrupulous if like if you look it up in the dictionary that's it'll give you a definition along those lines like someone that's trying to snake and make things happy and happen but and like I said I'm sure we'll cover that book at some point but after that he wrote another book which is called the art of war and it's it's definitely a really good book it's but I guess like when you think about just like how you said you know they know they're dead anyway kind of thing where it's like and then those can backfire too because they'll be like if all it takes is one defensive person to know that hey that ball is in play right now so they can just sort of walk over and hit it out of the hand grab it from whatever they want because no one's blocking them you know no one's like even it's kind of it's just risky check you get more people doing that they're going to be and they usually pressing forward like fully but when they're like discipline there's like that you see you can see the balance like they'll back up just a little bit you know so yes that's what you do you make people do hard scary things I mean in the Seal teams it's the same thing what do they do you're gonna learn how to parachute then you're gonna parachute at night then you're gonna parachute at night into the water then you're gonna jump out of a helicopter at night at you know 20 feet into the darkness and with a boat and you're gonna rig that thing up and you're gonna dive at night so what does that mean take care of your people take care make sure you take care of your logistics logistics wins wars and people need to survive so do that number 16 he that trust if more in horsemen than in footmen or more in footmen than in horsemen must accommodate himself with the situation so in the ancient times you had cavalry on horses and you had the infantrymen on feet and he said if you prefer one over the other then you have to put yourself in the right situation where it's advantageous so that that's why it's good to be well balanced and not really prefer one over the other but if you do then put yourself in a situation that's most advantageous to your style or preference of fighting like but make sure you learn how to wrestle because if you don't know how to wrestle someone else is going to dictate you where that fight's going to go 17 when Valrite see if in the day there be coming any spy into the camp cause every man to go into his lodge so you got to convince if you're telling you guys like hey we're probably gonna lose you don't say that you say look it's gonna be hard but there's a chance we could take this you know what I mean you got to get them in that attitude not the attitude of like so I was thinking a lot about that and tonight we're going to explore some principles of war actually called general rules by this individual Mackey of Ellie this is the Mackey of Ellie Nicole Mackey of Ellie this is the guy that wrote the prince he's got all kinds of great quotes out there it's better to be feared than loved if you can if you cannot be both he's got never never was anything great achieved without danger here's one if an injury has to be done to a man it should be so severe that his vengeance need not be feared that's pretty ruthless here's another one hence it comes about that all armed profits have been victorious and all unarmed profits have been destroyed in one more quick quote as you you can you can just google Mackey of Ellie in quotes and you'll find a bunch of great ones men rise from one ambition to another first they seek to secure themselves against attack then they attack others and that's actually from the prince which is his most famous book and if you think about the process of being a human being that right there is very accurate and you can really see that with accuracy if you overlay that on jiu jitsu first you seek to secure yourself from attack and then you attack others right when you're rolling that first when you first start you're just trying to defend yourself not to get children and then eventually you can stop from getting choked and you can stop from getting armed lock and start trying to attack those people and armed lock them so that's Mackey of Ellie and if you don't know anything about them he was an Italian really a politician and a diplomat and but on top of that this was during the Renaissance period But then, and then whatever it heats up, but I'm thinking like, not like the fuck, joccal guys going that cold surf like for a long time and so then I'm thinking, no, it's totally in context, you know.
