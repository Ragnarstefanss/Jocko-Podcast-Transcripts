But you know a loss of any team mate as you know as well as I do that like Mikey and and every time you know every time I lose even a new kid today which I've been out speaking to their class and stuff like that you lose a little bit more your heart. He's a guy kind of like I looked up to my father he was my sea daddy and he was always there for all of us and me and last night Tom Boyhand and me and Wayne Hampton and Mike Lechraas and how Kirkendall we're all getting a picture together and then remembering the great guys and we're all we're talking about Barry of course Barry fell past the way a few years ago and he's another guy you know it's like I say. Yeah, it's interesting to me, that I would, I think guys would feel more afraid when we were getting ready to go in the field, when even me, you know, when you have time to think, like, oh, we're going down the street, which is had, you know, 17 ID's on in the last four days. And that deployment what were you guys doing you guys were doing we guys deploying off of boats were you guys going in helicopters you guys going on foot patrols a little bit everything a little bit everything foot patrols basically sand pans. And so you guys decide or Tom, you know, let's you know, hey, let's do a small small group you're going to take five guys. You know how like when you listen, you're like, okay, you know, you kind of get a feel, but there's nothing in your heart of it. Then you got to go through the dam door and after you get through the door you got to prove yourself and like like you were saying we're a nobody back then you know if you had to have a couple of tours of it. So, you know, you know, have to be like, hey, made in America, but then, you know, it's closer or whatever. So even with all that action you guys went through the deployment with you know what did you take a few wounded guys but nobody was killed and actually we were always down at sea float and rich Solano was working with a gulf platoon I think and that was when the helicopter went down and of course when you come off a hot LZ And you know, you look at the guys are and Joe and those guys, of course, you know, he lost his life in a very basic operation. He's great big old black guy and the strongest of damn ox and you know actually events was one of the original sales in 1962 and he went over to Vietnam or course back then they didn't know what they were doing with the sales and they're not pretty time. And, you know, and the thing is, is that, it's like we go back to what we are, and the camaraderie, and going through training, and why we do things, and you're thanks like that. But you said I said I said I said I said I said I'm going back to bed. Well, you know, I mean, how proud all you guys were when we were there that molossin and you guys were saving your words and the Pentagon, you know, after Mike E. Montzure. You're not going to have like this these weird extra things like I don't know. it's it's you had like the classic case of the judge telling you all right son you can either join the Navy or we're going to find a place that you're not going to like so much as home You know, Tony Frady, who is the Charlie Petir and Chief, we used to talk about Mike Forton and we'd say, you know, just on random days, we'd say, hey, you know what Mike Forton's doing today? And then we would send the guys that need help should be going so we'd like rich solano myself and a bunch of the guys we'd go out and help other patents and stuff and were you a 60 gunner. And then he bought me beer and treated me like I was his brother the man himself treating a pathetic new guy like me like I was one of his long lost buddies. I used to ask guys what you've been working for my father for 30 years you know he said because he and my dad always told me this and that's what I tried to do when I was in the team take care of your people your people will take care of you. And, you know, Mike again, um, like everyone's going to want to tell you and it tells you all the time. yet and at seal team one at the time as I have accounted over and over again we knew guys pretty much got treated like worthless scum. When guys like Gary Gallagher and Walt Gustavl and Doc Seal came up to you and said, Nice job over there or good work getting your lieutenant back off that beach. I know that so it's like you say you, you know, if you die, which we're all, we understand what our job is, that being Navy sales, but I can never live with myself, no one that fused that. and it's like, you know, then I don't know how up to date you are on the new jump rope. And as was instilled us, you know, Tom Boyhand was saying last night, you said, you know, I don't think you're in New York, fear was. And it's like flickin' the switch, you know, why switch, you get your mind, and know what your supposed to be doin'. So you got a seal out there on the boats that are going to be recovering you because it's a guy that you know it's a guy that you trust. It's like the, you're going to kind of come out with almost like a life kit. And so they had actually, as they were calling in this Naval Gunfire, Tommy was like, seeing guys coming and like through the grace of God, a one big round hit there. And he said, I'd like to make a choice in uncle Dave said, well, I bet you I know who it is. I always told guys look if you want to be you know if you want to master what you do you got to go and teach it. But you know Tom Thomas saying that there's no at the operational level you guys were like oh that's great And, you know, when I hear people throwing the word here all around, you know, I always, I always say what I hear a lot of veterans say, and that is the real heroes didn't come home. So those are the guys you're working with and I think it's I mean you get into the relationship that you formed with these guys which was you know they were all their brothers. And they fired danger, close rounds, meaning like rounds that we know are going to be very close to our friendly forces. No, that's actually a great, and again, obviously, I can't cover the whole book on this show, but get the book because there's Dick Coward's did a great job of actually going out and talking to the people that were firing, talking to people on the Morgan. I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, you know, like the state. And we all learned and Mike was a great M60 guy he saved our ass as many times and everybody did their job is just as you were saying while he was a team effort and my life was saved by people like Mike Lecos and other people in our pertinent and we backed each other up all the time. And I know what part of that they're going through, but you know, until you lose a child, a child of your own. Um, Well, you know, the, like I said, if you go and get this book, you can, you can read it. But he's right on the shoreline, so the waves are breaking, this making a lot of turbulence and noise, and the other guys up in the sand, he said, the high water line, walking around, looking like that. I know how to change all of the, they said you know, try to pull that one over my eyes. You know, they said, no, I said, well, I'm going to get in trouble when I take him out. And his like, and he's going, you know, through the ocean all this stuff. I know when we went on the operation, Woody was we always had a seal as you know on an insertion extraction craft and Woody had a. So that way I know the money is going where it's supposed to be going. You know, then with the grenades, you know, and they were getting as you mentioned what our grenade, of course, we have a four second delay in hours. Now, you get out, you know, past like you said, past the small arms fire. And be like, okay, no, I'm going to look at someone might like forward more than Chevy or whatever. And for me this book was like the detail debrief that I always wanted to have, you know, not only the operation that you did with Tommy, but also don't want And you know, I had this with my guys that got wounded and none of them wanted to go home. The initial salvo from the Morton that was the ship out at sea although I didn't know it at the time that it was the Morton shooting had made the bad guys think twice about advancing on the dune with the bunker. I went all the way through the ranks and I got a commission and I did this and I'm just trying to say there's only one in that's what I tell these kids when they go through training but you know that. We were like I said, you know, and I've talked about the camaraderie in the respect we have for each other. Now we had, actually I think we had more like 18 in listed guys and we broke it up and Gary Gare, Chamberlain and Harry Conacula went with Lieutenant Houth down one thing. Rebarb about 20 inches out so if you got hit by an RNG it exploded there instead of going through the whole we did a lot of like I was working down that. I mean it's kind of like when he talks better be like EF Hut better be listening keeping your ears wide open and just. So, and then like you said, you know you're in the wrong space, but you might as well do in reconnaissance while you're there. You even though you want to know that get these really good debriefs in the seal teams and you think that there was a a fault with all these great debriefs and that explained to you everything that happened on certain missions, especially highly important missions. And then you had two seal team two officers and in plus with those two seal team two officers who were sound like they were more junior guys maybe it was their first deployment. I've made the connection and Roger and I talked about the fact that you know some of the training that you guys implemented back there the the point man course we're walking through and the trip wires are there and all that we still did that a lot of the demo we still did. I said we better treat that and the seal said something like, yeah, whatever. I was another mentor like Barry not to me and they went through class two of UDT back in the 50s and never of all in Korean stuff and he led by example again you know And I was thinking about you know going through training here's here's a quote from you coming through training we had some instructors who are not only good teachers but they were real characters there was Vince a live era.
