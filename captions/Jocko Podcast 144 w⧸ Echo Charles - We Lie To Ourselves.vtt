00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.66
This is Jockel Podcast number 144.

2
00:00:03.66 --> 00:00:06.80
With echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink.

3
00:00:06.80 --> 00:00:07.64
Good evening, echo.

4
00:00:07.64 --> 00:00:08.64
Good evening.

5
00:00:08.64 --> 00:00:16.26
And a few episodes back, I referenced an interview that I had read with Colonel David

6
00:00:16.26 --> 00:00:17.26
Hackworth.

7
00:00:17.26 --> 00:00:22.32
The author of about face, my favorite book of all time, check.

8
00:00:22.32 --> 00:00:25.76
And it was actually on podcast number 142.

9
00:00:25.76 --> 00:00:30.40
And I referenced this interview and I said I would cover it in the future on a podcast.

10
00:00:30.40 --> 00:00:31.72
So here we are.

11
00:00:31.72 --> 00:00:32.72
144.

12
00:00:32.72 --> 00:00:36.80
The interview is from PBS.org.

13
00:00:36.80 --> 00:00:40.56
They had a show called People's Century.

14
00:00:40.56 --> 00:00:45.24
And inside that show, inside that series, there was one part of it.

15
00:00:45.24 --> 00:00:47.000
I guess it maybe was an episode.

16
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.28
It was called Gorilla War.

17
00:00:49.28 --> 00:00:54.96
So we're going to take a look at that also on top of that to expand on some of the

18
00:00:54.96 --> 00:00:55.96
topics.

19
00:00:55.96 --> 00:01:01.64
I'm also going to take a look at a book called Vietnam Primer.

20
00:01:01.64 --> 00:01:03.64
And it's a pretty cool book.

21
00:01:03.64 --> 00:01:04.64
It's very tactical.

22
00:01:04.64 --> 00:01:09.52
And when I say tactical, I'm not talking about, I'm talking actual tactical.

23
00:01:09.52 --> 00:01:14.08
Like it shows where you should put your security elements while you're in Vietnam.

24
00:01:14.08 --> 00:01:18.16
What's the best way to maneuver through the jungle in Vietnam?

25
00:01:18.16 --> 00:01:21.12
It's very, very specific to that kind of jungle fighting.

26
00:01:21.12 --> 00:01:24.36
But there are definitely some topics in it that I wanted to pull out.

27
00:01:24.36 --> 00:01:31.04
That is the book in about face when Hackworth is talking about working with SLA Marshall,

28
00:01:31.04 --> 00:01:35.88
which we covered his book on 142.

29
00:01:35.88 --> 00:01:37.48
He's talking about how he worked with him.

30
00:01:37.48 --> 00:01:42.12
And they wrote when they got done with going and interviewing all these people, they wrote

31
00:01:42.12 --> 00:01:44.44
the book Vietnam Primer.

32
00:01:44.44 --> 00:01:47.48
And so I wanted to at least take a look at that.

33
00:01:47.48 --> 00:01:53.68
I probably won't cover it any great depth on the podcast because it's so tactical.

34
00:01:53.68 --> 00:01:56.44
And it's very specific to that time.

35
00:01:56.44 --> 00:01:58.32
And maybe I'll cover it someday.

36
00:01:58.32 --> 00:02:00.12
But because you never know.

37
00:02:00.12 --> 00:02:05.44
Well, anyways, there's definitely some things to get out of it that I want to look at.

38
00:02:05.44 --> 00:02:07.84
And we'll pull some of those up today.

39
00:02:07.84 --> 00:02:12.36
But the basis is to look at this interview with Hackworth.

40
00:02:12.36 --> 00:02:15.16
And I think you're going to see it.

41
00:02:15.16 --> 00:02:21.32
It takes a lot of stuff from about face and just really puts it in the clear.

42
00:02:21.32 --> 00:02:28.44
So here we go, people's century, guerrilla wars.

43
00:02:28.44 --> 00:02:34.28
And this is the interview with David Hackworth from PBS.

44
00:02:34.28 --> 00:02:39.12
What do you think the Viet Kong learned from Mount Saitong?

45
00:02:39.12 --> 00:02:44.76
And Hackworth says, I think the major thing was how a poor man fights a rich man.

46
00:02:44.76 --> 00:02:51.14
How a war can be fought employing ancient rules first developed by Sunsu, the need for

47
00:02:51.14 --> 00:02:58.74
patience, the need for political motivation, the need to fight a war of economy and how to

48
00:02:58.74 --> 00:03:02.12
employ all the rules of warfare.

49
00:03:02.12 --> 00:03:03.12
So there you go.

50
00:03:03.12 --> 00:03:08.56
That's a little way to start this thing off, the need for patience, the need for political

51
00:03:08.56 --> 00:03:10.60
motivation, he gets into this.

52
00:03:10.60 --> 00:03:13.56
And he talks a lot about talks a lot about the economy.

53
00:03:13.56 --> 00:03:17.44
Because that's something that you can lose track of as a front line person.

54
00:03:17.44 --> 00:03:19.48
But you need to think about it.

55
00:03:19.48 --> 00:03:23.08
Next, this is very interesting.

56
00:03:23.08 --> 00:03:27.28
One lesson should the Americans have learned from the French defeat.

57
00:03:27.28 --> 00:03:29.88
So the French got beaten Vietnam and here's what Hackworth says.

58
00:03:29.88 --> 00:03:36.44
Well, I think the major lesson they should have learned was that that war didn't involve

59
00:03:36.44 --> 00:03:38.16
the security of France.

60
00:03:38.16 --> 00:03:41.24
And the security of the United States, it wasn't at issue either.

61
00:03:41.24 --> 00:03:45.72
On a tactical level, they didn't have an objective.

62
00:03:45.72 --> 00:03:47.60
They didn't have an objective on a tactical level.

63
00:03:47.60 --> 00:03:52.64
So clearly the point is you have to have an objective.

64
00:03:52.64 --> 00:03:54.28
He goes on.

65
00:03:54.28 --> 00:03:58.32
The Americans should have studied the lessons of the French very closely and taken something

66
00:03:58.32 --> 00:03:59.32
from them.

67
00:03:59.32 --> 00:04:03.88
A correspondent once asked the General Westmourlin, the American Commanding General and

68
00:04:03.88 --> 00:04:09.28
architect of the war, what he thought of how the French fought the war and was he studying

69
00:04:09.28 --> 00:04:12.16
the lessons of the French.

70
00:04:12.16 --> 00:04:16.16
He said, why should I study the lessons of the French?

71
00:04:16.16 --> 00:04:19.84
They haven't won a war since Napoleon.

72
00:04:19.84 --> 00:04:26.20
This was the attitude of American total arrogance.

73
00:04:26.20 --> 00:04:28.28
We didn't learn from the past.

74
00:04:28.28 --> 00:04:34.68
We didn't learn from our own experience by going back to when we beat Britain in 1776.

75
00:04:34.68 --> 00:04:39.08
At that time, the British had argued that we didn't fight in formations such as theirs,

76
00:04:39.08 --> 00:04:41.08
a big block formation.

77
00:04:41.08 --> 00:04:45.92
We didn't meet them in the open and fought, and we fought like the Indians, behind trees

78
00:04:45.92 --> 00:04:48.44
using concealment and cover and so on.

79
00:04:48.44 --> 00:04:54.16
And a couple hundred years later, we had the British mentality towards fighting.

80
00:04:54.16 --> 00:05:01.12
And we had forgotten the lessons that we had taught the British.

81
00:05:01.12 --> 00:05:03.000
That's things, doesn't it?

82
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.60
And that ego gets out of control.

83
00:05:05.60 --> 00:05:07.64
Can you think about that?

84
00:05:07.64 --> 00:05:11.88
That quote from Westmourlin is awful.

85
00:05:11.88 --> 00:05:14.32
Why should I study the lessons of French?

86
00:05:14.32 --> 00:05:17.08
They hadn't won a war since Napoleon.

87
00:05:17.08 --> 00:05:21.52
That's awful to read.

88
00:05:21.52 --> 00:05:30.72
That is why the seals that when I was running training, the seals that would get fired,

89
00:05:30.72 --> 00:05:36.56
the seals that would get fired for leadership problems or from leadership positions,

90
00:05:36.56 --> 00:05:37.72
they would be getting fired.

91
00:05:37.72 --> 00:05:42.84
Because of that attitude right there, they don't listen to anybody.

92
00:05:42.84 --> 00:05:46.44
And what's interesting about this hackworth is actually saying, the lose, you should

93
00:05:46.44 --> 00:05:52.28
actually even listen to the loser.

94
00:05:52.28 --> 00:05:55.04
Put that ego in check.

95
00:05:55.04 --> 00:05:57.08
Next question.

96
00:05:57.08 --> 00:06:03.40
Don't you think that the United States tremendous firepower could have won the war?

97
00:06:03.40 --> 00:06:04.76
Hackworth.

98
00:06:04.76 --> 00:06:08.92
The war could never have been won in terms of the employment of firepower.

99
00:06:08.92 --> 00:06:13.72
The solution to winning the war was to cause reform in the government to win the hearts

100
00:06:13.72 --> 00:06:19.24
and minds of the people to make the cause justifiable so that the people of the country

101
00:06:19.24 --> 00:06:21.80
were willing to give up their lives.

102
00:06:21.80 --> 00:06:23.76
This was not done.

103
00:06:23.76 --> 00:06:28.000
You could have used all the firepower in the world, all the technical ability that the

104
00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:35.60
US had to fight the enemy, and you'd have maybe won a temporary tactical respite.

105
00:06:35.60 --> 00:06:40.24
That's important because sometimes you think yourself, well if we put enough bombs on

106
00:06:40.24 --> 00:06:42.76
them, we can shut them down.

107
00:06:42.76 --> 00:06:45.48
I mean, short of nooking them.

108
00:06:45.48 --> 00:06:46.56
But I think that's important.

109
00:06:46.56 --> 00:06:49.52
He's saying you could maybe possibly win.

110
00:06:49.52 --> 00:06:50.52
Because I think that's enough.

111
00:06:50.52 --> 00:06:53.72
Yeah, I mean, if you drop enough bombs on people, you know, you can shut them down.

112
00:06:53.72 --> 00:07:00.52
But he's saying you can win a tactical, a temporary tactical respite.

113
00:07:00.52 --> 00:07:06.64
Back to the interview, but we'd never won a war strategically unless we had people had the

114
00:07:06.64 --> 00:07:08.68
people join our side.

115
00:07:08.68 --> 00:07:10.32
I'm going to read that again.

116
00:07:10.32 --> 00:07:15.36
But we'd never have won the war strategically unless we had the people on our side.

117
00:07:15.36 --> 00:07:20.44
The war was about the people in winning over their hearts and their minds and their allegiance

118
00:07:20.44 --> 00:07:21.92
to the host country.

119
00:07:21.92 --> 00:07:27.52
The host country in Vietnam was made up of gangsters.

120
00:07:27.52 --> 00:07:29.40
Next question.

121
00:07:29.40 --> 00:07:32.88
But you weren't there as a soldier to win hearts and minds.

122
00:07:32.88 --> 00:07:36.80
You were there strictly for military purposes.

123
00:07:36.80 --> 00:07:38.000
Hackworth.

124
00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:43.04
If you were a student of warfare, if you were a student of warfare as I was, you quickly realized

125
00:07:43.04 --> 00:07:48.12
that tactically, we were not going to win the war and we had to win the people.

126
00:07:48.12 --> 00:07:53.12
And this is basically the same conclusion.

127
00:07:53.12 --> 00:07:55.84
When I got to Iraq the second time and I saw the intel reports and saw that what we were

128
00:07:55.84 --> 00:07:59.24
doing was the capture kill missions.

129
00:07:59.24 --> 00:08:02.24
And I saw that they had as many targets.

130
00:08:02.24 --> 00:08:09.88
You know, I was in Iraq, 2003, 2004, and they had as many targets up on the wall in 2006

131
00:08:09.88 --> 00:08:12.88
when I got back as they had when I left.

132
00:08:12.88 --> 00:08:18.08
So that to me said, this is just, when is this ever going to stop?

133
00:08:18.08 --> 00:08:20.16
It didn't look like it to me.

134
00:08:20.16 --> 00:08:21.68
We had to do something different.

135
00:08:21.68 --> 00:08:24.24
And that's when I read the counter-insertancy manual.

136
00:08:24.24 --> 00:08:30.12
My second day on the poemeters, something like that, and figured out what he was saying

137
00:08:30.12 --> 00:08:31.12
right there.

138
00:08:31.12 --> 00:08:35.36
You had to take care of the people.

139
00:08:35.36 --> 00:08:37.36
Next question.

140
00:08:37.36 --> 00:08:43.64
So were the efforts to resettle whole villages of Vietnamese a good way to fight this war?

141
00:08:43.64 --> 00:08:44.64
Hackworth.

142
00:08:44.64 --> 00:08:50.44
So, because the Americans again tried to impose their values on the country of Vietnam without

143
00:08:50.44 --> 00:08:53.68
understanding the culture and the religion of Vietnam.

144
00:08:53.68 --> 00:08:58.24
It was a country made up of Buddhists who worshipped ancestors.

145
00:08:58.24 --> 00:09:02.36
Frequently, listen this, frequently people who had been moved from their homes would go through

146
00:09:02.36 --> 00:09:06.08
mine fields to get back to worship at the graves of their ancestors.

147
00:09:06.08 --> 00:09:12.72
We didn't understand that we didn't understand what the Vietnamese culture was all about.

148
00:09:12.72 --> 00:09:16.96
So imagine that you're thinking you can just move people around.

149
00:09:16.96 --> 00:09:18.56
No, actually you can't do that.

150
00:09:18.56 --> 00:09:20.44
That ground is holy to them.

151
00:09:20.44 --> 00:09:22.04
That ground is where their family is.

152
00:09:22.04 --> 00:09:25.08
They have deep rooted ties.

153
00:09:25.08 --> 00:09:26.96
And we didn't recognize that.

154
00:09:26.96 --> 00:09:28.28
Next question.

155
00:09:28.28 --> 00:09:32.64
What do you think was so particularly good about the Vietnam scurrilla fighters?

156
00:09:32.64 --> 00:09:36.76
What did you as a military man respect about them most?

157
00:09:36.76 --> 00:09:37.76
Hackworth.

158
00:09:37.76 --> 00:09:44.24
We respected their dedication, the fire in their belly, their great strong belief in freedom.

159
00:09:44.24 --> 00:09:46.88
So, that's interesting.

160
00:09:46.88 --> 00:09:51.44
Because of course, we're looking at them, we're looking at the Vietnamese thinking they're

161
00:09:51.44 --> 00:09:58.40
communist and they're, we think we're fighting for freedom, right?

162
00:09:58.40 --> 00:10:09.000
And this is, this is a fairly common opinion about Vietnam is that they just didn't want

163
00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:10.000
outsiders.

164
00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:15.56
Like they saw any outsiders were, were imposing on their freedom.

165
00:10:15.56 --> 00:10:20.12
So even if we were going to bring glorious democracy, it wasn't their glorious democracy

166
00:10:20.12 --> 00:10:24.36
since anyone at home.

167
00:10:24.36 --> 00:10:28.80
Back to the interview, there's was a mission, a complete dedication to winning independence

168
00:10:28.80 --> 00:10:29.80
for their country.

169
00:10:29.80 --> 00:10:30.80
So there you have it.

170
00:10:30.80 --> 00:10:34.28
So I respected them for where they were coming from.

171
00:10:34.28 --> 00:10:35.52
Maybe it was empathy.

172
00:10:35.52 --> 00:10:39.68
My ancestors, two or three hundred years ago, had fought for the British.

173
00:10:39.68 --> 00:10:42.92
Oh, sorry, had fought the British.

174
00:10:42.92 --> 00:10:45.36
What about their strategy in tactics?

175
00:10:45.36 --> 00:10:47.04
Hackworth.

176
00:10:47.04 --> 00:10:51.92
As fighters, they were very fanatical and very dedicated.

177
00:10:51.92 --> 00:10:56.40
They were like my paratroopers who were extraordinarily fine soldiers.

178
00:10:56.40 --> 00:11:00.72
A soldier tends to respect the counterpart that's a heavyweight.

179
00:11:00.72 --> 00:11:07.12
And they were indeed heavyweights because of their devotion to the cause.

180
00:11:07.12 --> 00:11:08.64
Next question.

181
00:11:08.64 --> 00:11:14.12
A female gorilla leader said that sometimes when they shot an American soldier, his comrades

182
00:11:14.12 --> 00:11:18.96
would come up to get the body and then they'd all burst into tears, which she said was

183
00:11:18.96 --> 00:11:24.08
a wonderful opportunity to shoot them or to grab their weapons.

184
00:11:24.08 --> 00:11:26.40
Is that a fair comment?

185
00:11:26.40 --> 00:11:28.68
Hackworth.

186
00:11:28.68 --> 00:11:30.68
It's right on the mark.

187
00:11:30.68 --> 00:11:38.16
The problem with Americans fighting that war was that as the war went on, they lost leadership.

188
00:11:38.16 --> 00:11:42.28
They lost their hardcore professional leaders.

189
00:11:42.28 --> 00:11:45.36
A professional soldier does not go after wounded.

190
00:11:45.36 --> 00:11:47.60
He leaves that to the medics.

191
00:11:47.60 --> 00:11:52.68
The soldiers that are not well trained and not well disciplined by their leaders tend to

192
00:11:52.68 --> 00:11:58.20
become more of a group of fraternity buddies who care very much for their fallen comrades

193
00:11:58.20 --> 00:12:01.56
and who want to get him out of the line of fire.

194
00:12:01.56 --> 00:12:07.28
In Vietnam, it was known that the standard technique to use was to hit the first guy,

195
00:12:07.28 --> 00:12:10.64
then take out anybody going after him.

196
00:12:10.64 --> 00:12:13.84
That was how they'd add to their casualty list.

197
00:12:13.84 --> 00:12:18.56
I've had my soldiers tell me that a guy might have been hit in the leg in a hot firefight

198
00:12:18.56 --> 00:12:24.68
and his opponent only 10 or 15 feet away would be pointing at him, giving him the finger,

199
00:12:24.68 --> 00:12:28.64
doing all these things to tease him while he's waiting for someone to come out and pull

200
00:12:28.64 --> 00:12:30.32
him away.

201
00:12:30.32 --> 00:12:36.000
Then they could blow that guy away too.

202
00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.000
Prioritized an execute.

203
00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:41.000
You've got to know what the most important problem you've got and it's not the wounded guy.

204
00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:45.40
It's the guy that's trying to kill you.

205
00:12:45.40 --> 00:12:50.72
You've got to be able to train your guys to be able to overcome that emotional situation

206
00:12:50.72 --> 00:12:52.92
that they're going through because that's going to be the instinct.

207
00:12:52.92 --> 00:12:56.68
That's the human instinct.

208
00:12:56.68 --> 00:12:57.68
Next question.

209
00:12:57.68 --> 00:13:02.68
The Vietcong hit in the jungle, but in the Maycong Delta there really isn't any jungle,

210
00:13:02.68 --> 00:13:04.44
so where did the Vietcong hide?

211
00:13:04.44 --> 00:13:07.12
I like this answer.

212
00:13:07.12 --> 00:13:08.12
Hackworth.

213
00:13:08.12 --> 00:13:12.80
Well, they were hidden in the jungle that was always alongside the waterways which tended

214
00:13:12.80 --> 00:13:17.16
to be very thick and well-buby trapped out in front.

215
00:13:17.16 --> 00:13:19.08
They were hidden by the people.

216
00:13:19.08 --> 00:13:20.48
They hid in the waterways.

217
00:13:20.48 --> 00:13:24.04
They would get underwater and take a read and put it above the water and breathe through

218
00:13:24.04 --> 00:13:25.04
that.

219
00:13:25.04 --> 00:13:28.84
Then surround themselves with a bit of floating neepa grass.

220
00:13:28.84 --> 00:13:33.76
They would dig caves under the waterways and then put a bit of read up to the top and

221
00:13:33.76 --> 00:13:39.12
breathe through that. They were very, very cunning fighters.

222
00:13:39.12 --> 00:13:45.56
Yeah, that's like what you hear about in the movies, right?

223
00:13:45.56 --> 00:13:47.32
The little read.

224
00:13:47.32 --> 00:13:48.32
Breathing through a read.

225
00:13:48.32 --> 00:13:49.32
They're actually doing that.

226
00:13:49.32 --> 00:13:52.40
He goes into that more here.

227
00:13:52.40 --> 00:13:53.40
Next question.

228
00:13:53.40 --> 00:13:58.08
Did you have any personal experience of finding Vietcong lurking under the water surface?

229
00:13:58.08 --> 00:13:59.08
Hackworth.

230
00:13:59.08 --> 00:14:00.08
Oh, commonly.

231
00:14:00.08 --> 00:14:03.72
If we saw a bit of neepa floating down a waterway, a bit of jungle debris, we

232
00:14:03.72 --> 00:14:07.96
fired out it in invariably, it would turn red.

233
00:14:07.96 --> 00:14:12.60
That meant that below was a Vietcong hanging onto the roots of the debris with a read

234
00:14:12.60 --> 00:14:15.84
going up to get air and we'd killed one enemy.

235
00:14:15.84 --> 00:14:20.04
Once we located them, I always took concertino wire and put it on both sides of the

236
00:14:20.04 --> 00:14:22.12
creeks so they couldn't float down.

237
00:14:22.12 --> 00:14:23.40
They'd run into the wire.

238
00:14:23.40 --> 00:14:27.96
I instructed my soldiers to fire at any foliage and in most cases there would be a

239
00:14:27.96 --> 00:14:31.64
Vietcong hanging on trying to get out.

240
00:14:31.64 --> 00:14:36.96
They were simply the most skillful, the most dedicated, the best opponent of struck in almost

241
00:14:36.96 --> 00:14:39.48
50 years of being around soldiers.

242
00:14:39.48 --> 00:14:43.40
They're the best.

243
00:14:43.40 --> 00:14:44.64
Question.

244
00:14:44.64 --> 00:14:47.40
What other problems were unique in the Maycon Delta?

245
00:14:47.40 --> 00:14:51.08
The problem in the Delta was not only the terrible conditions that prevailed there, but

246
00:14:51.08 --> 00:14:53.56
it was the impact it had on your soldiers.

247
00:14:53.56 --> 00:14:55.64
I'm speaking now as an American.

248
00:14:55.64 --> 00:14:59.48
We had terrible casualties from what we called immersion foot.

249
00:14:59.48 --> 00:15:04.32
immersion foot was the problem in World War I called trench foot.

250
00:15:04.32 --> 00:15:08.36
After being in the water for a long time, the feet would become very soft and the boot

251
00:15:08.36 --> 00:15:11.48
rubbing against the foot would become very abrasive.

252
00:15:11.48 --> 00:15:15.36
Suddenly you'd have a hole in your foot, the size of a bullet hole, and suddenly you're

253
00:15:15.36 --> 00:15:19.24
a lost soldier.

254
00:15:19.24 --> 00:15:22.56
We had to be very wary and take care of the feet.

255
00:15:22.56 --> 00:15:27.24
There was no place to sleep so you were in the water at night.

256
00:15:27.24 --> 00:15:30.56
The soldiers were in the water and you stayed miserable and wet.

257
00:15:30.56 --> 00:15:33.84
My rule was that a unit could only stay in the field for five days.

258
00:15:33.84 --> 00:15:39.12
After five days immersion foot said in so badly that a whole battalion of 800 men could

259
00:15:39.12 --> 00:15:43.72
be laid up for weeks.

260
00:15:43.72 --> 00:15:45.60
I got immersion foot one time.

261
00:15:45.60 --> 00:15:48.88
I got legit immersion foot.

262
00:15:48.88 --> 00:15:55.88
So I was doing a training exercise in.

263
00:15:55.88 --> 00:16:01.000
It was we were doing a training exercise doing a reconnaissance of an air field that was

264
00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.72
located around the swamp.

265
00:16:03.72 --> 00:16:09.68
So I spent five or six days in this swamp.

266
00:16:09.68 --> 00:16:13.68
Not the whole five or six days, but a good amount of days and plus the days I wasn't

267
00:16:13.68 --> 00:16:15.36
in the swamp there was heavy rain.

268
00:16:15.36 --> 00:16:17.92
Just my feet were wet for an extended period of time.

269
00:16:17.92 --> 00:16:23.36
Actually on this particular training exercise, when we were going into the field, it was

270
00:16:23.36 --> 00:16:29.64
raining when we got in the field that started sleeping, you know, like ice and that turned

271
00:16:29.64 --> 00:16:31.88
to snow.

272
00:16:31.88 --> 00:16:36.80
So it was right around, and then in the daytime it warmed up and it turned back to rain.

273
00:16:36.80 --> 00:16:39.68
But it was a pretty miserable six days.

274
00:16:39.68 --> 00:16:44.72
When I got out of the field and quite frankly I didn't really understand the threat

275
00:16:44.72 --> 00:16:45.72
of immersion foot.

276
00:16:45.72 --> 00:16:49.40
So I just kept my boots on probably almost the whole time.

277
00:16:49.40 --> 00:16:52.36
When I got out my feet were really jacked up, really jacked up.

278
00:16:52.36 --> 00:16:53.36
I was metafact.

279
00:16:53.36 --> 00:16:56.92
I was looking at some pictures just to see how bad I had it compared to how bad it

280
00:16:56.92 --> 00:16:57.92
can get.

281
00:16:57.92 --> 00:17:04.84
I just looked at some pictures on the interwebs and my feet were jacked up legit.

282
00:17:04.84 --> 00:17:10.56
Well, I mean obviously this is, I mean I've never heard immersion foot, but that's a common

283
00:17:10.56 --> 00:17:11.56
for the trench foot, right?

284
00:17:11.56 --> 00:17:12.56
Yeah, yeah.

285
00:17:12.56 --> 00:17:13.92
So that's common knowledge, right?

286
00:17:13.92 --> 00:17:14.92
Yeah.

287
00:17:14.92 --> 00:17:19.60
Because remember a forced gump when he said that when he's like, Lieutenant Dan, when he made

288
00:17:19.60 --> 00:17:22.04
a motorcycle, I'm going to tell you two things or whatever.

289
00:17:22.04 --> 00:17:23.60
And one of them was keep your socks.

290
00:17:23.60 --> 00:17:24.60
Keep your socks dry.

291
00:17:24.60 --> 00:17:25.60
Yeah, yeah.

292
00:17:25.60 --> 00:17:26.60
Yeah.

293
00:17:26.60 --> 00:17:28.80
So that's definitely a common thing.

294
00:17:28.80 --> 00:17:30.80
Then he talks about it a lot.

295
00:17:30.80 --> 00:17:34.60
You got to get in spec, guys feet, make sure the feet are good to go.

296
00:17:34.60 --> 00:17:37.24
When guys feet aren't good to go, they're done.

297
00:17:37.24 --> 00:17:39.48
You can't walk, you're done.

298
00:17:39.48 --> 00:17:42.92
But my feet from that immersion foot, they were numb.

299
00:17:42.92 --> 00:17:44.48
They were numb like dead.

300
00:17:44.48 --> 00:17:48.96
Why does it got cold or it was just the wetness?

301
00:17:48.96 --> 00:17:49.96
Yeah.

302
00:17:49.96 --> 00:17:52.48
It was cold, it only snowed and red.

303
00:17:52.48 --> 00:17:56.76
It only was below freezing that first night and then it was warmer, but they were wet for

304
00:17:56.76 --> 00:17:57.76
a long time.

305
00:17:57.76 --> 00:17:58.76
Yeah.

306
00:17:58.76 --> 00:17:59.76
That was a lot of young.

307
00:17:59.76 --> 00:18:02.20
And then when you take it, they don't take off your shoes.

308
00:18:02.20 --> 00:18:04.12
Does it like does the pain set in then?

309
00:18:04.12 --> 00:18:09.28
Or no, they were actually they went, they didn't hurt at, no, they did.

310
00:18:09.28 --> 00:18:11.84
But they didn't hurt, they hurt more when I got out of the field.

311
00:18:11.84 --> 00:18:12.84
Yeah.

312
00:18:12.84 --> 00:18:13.84
That's when they started to hurt.

313
00:18:13.84 --> 00:18:14.84
Yeah.

314
00:18:14.84 --> 00:18:16.20
Because they were actually numb.

315
00:18:16.20 --> 00:18:17.20
Yeah.

316
00:18:17.20 --> 00:18:22.56
I mean, the way I imagined it is like, you know, I don't know, you're in the pool or

317
00:18:22.56 --> 00:18:23.56
the bath.

318
00:18:23.56 --> 00:18:25.96
When you're a kid you're in the bath for like super super long.

319
00:18:25.96 --> 00:18:26.96
I get all the water.

320
00:18:26.96 --> 00:18:27.96
Yeah, you get the wrinkle.

321
00:18:27.96 --> 00:18:28.96
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

322
00:18:28.96 --> 00:18:29.96
Like prunes or whatever.

323
00:18:29.96 --> 00:18:31.96
And it's pruned up feet.

324
00:18:31.96 --> 00:18:32.96
But it's like that.

325
00:18:32.96 --> 00:18:33.96
But it's like five days.

326
00:18:33.96 --> 00:18:35.36
Yeah, it's going like too far, kind of.

327
00:18:35.36 --> 00:18:38.36
Yeah, because they seem kind of sensitive too when you think about it, you know, like

328
00:18:38.36 --> 00:18:39.36
they're going to sensitive.

329
00:18:39.36 --> 00:18:42.52
That's what it's like, oh man.

330
00:18:42.52 --> 00:18:45.52
So next.

331
00:18:45.52 --> 00:18:47.52
Next question, why were you men in the water?

332
00:18:47.52 --> 00:18:51.52
Why didn't they walk along the banks or along pathways between patty fields?

333
00:18:51.52 --> 00:18:52.52
Hackworth.

334
00:18:52.52 --> 00:18:55.84
You could expect any dry surface was mined in booby trapped.

335
00:18:55.84 --> 00:19:01.04
And 60% of all casualties we hadn't Vietnam came from mines and booby traps laid.

336
00:19:01.04 --> 00:19:07.12
I might add by those local guerrillas who the generals at the top West Moreland and

337
00:19:07.12 --> 00:19:10.64
assistance didn't count.

338
00:19:10.64 --> 00:19:12.20
So he's saying the local guerrillas.

339
00:19:12.20 --> 00:19:18.000
They talk about the generals like West Moreland would say, oh, you know, there's this

340
00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:23.24
many people and they wouldn't count the local populace or these local guerrillas as

341
00:19:23.24 --> 00:19:24.24
insurgents.

342
00:19:24.24 --> 00:19:25.24
I.

343
00:19:25.24 --> 00:19:30.80
Continuing, they didn't believe that they were the enemy because their mentality was a

344
00:19:30.80 --> 00:19:32.56
World War two mentality.

345
00:19:32.56 --> 00:19:35.36
They didn't understand the nature of the war.

346
00:19:35.36 --> 00:19:39.52
They were refighting World War two and they thought they could win the war by applying

347
00:19:39.52 --> 00:19:46.08
heavy firepower the outpouring of Detroit and great technological ability.

348
00:19:46.08 --> 00:19:49.48
They thought they would steam roll the opponent into defeat.

349
00:19:49.48 --> 00:19:55.12
They found that a war could not be won with bulldozers against somebody fighting with

350
00:19:55.12 --> 00:19:59.28
great cause.

351
00:19:59.28 --> 00:20:00.68
Next question.

352
00:20:00.68 --> 00:20:05.36
But after the Ted offensive, didn't the heavy bombing raids actually take a very heavy

353
00:20:05.36 --> 00:20:08.52
toll on the Vietcong.

354
00:20:08.52 --> 00:20:15.16
Well, general Lame said, if I had enough bombs, I could win this war because I'd blast

355
00:20:15.16 --> 00:20:18.76
the Vietcong to the Stone Age.

356
00:20:18.76 --> 00:20:23.02
What he didn't understand was that the Vietcong to me, we're already living in the Stone

357
00:20:23.02 --> 00:20:28.76
Age and that firepower wouldn't work under those circumstances.

358
00:20:28.76 --> 00:20:35.64
I do think you're correct that at the end of Ted 1968 February 1968, we increased the

359
00:20:35.64 --> 00:20:38.88
amount of bomb tonage out of frustration.

360
00:20:38.88 --> 00:20:42.12
Vietnoms, a country about the size of California in terms of area.

361
00:20:42.12 --> 00:20:47.28
We used three times the amount of bombs in the Vietnom war as we did in all of World War

362
00:20:47.28 --> 00:20:52.36
two, both the allies and the Axis.

363
00:20:52.36 --> 00:20:55.08
How's that for just completely insane?

364
00:20:55.08 --> 00:21:00.08
We put enough steel on that California size target to sink it and it did not cause the

365
00:21:00.08 --> 00:21:01.48
opponent to give in.

366
00:21:01.48 --> 00:21:07.28
Firepower was not the answer, the answer was to win the hearts and minds of the people.

367
00:21:07.28 --> 00:21:09.44
Question why didn't firepower work?

368
00:21:09.44 --> 00:21:15.76
Hackworth, well, what firepower did using pursuit aircraft fighter aircraft fighter bombers

369
00:21:15.76 --> 00:21:22.24
artillery mortar and so on, what it did was it galvanized the opponent, it put steel in

370
00:21:22.24 --> 00:21:23.40
their back.

371
00:21:23.40 --> 00:21:27.32
They could see themselves being struck by a giant and they had no way, no recourse

372
00:21:27.32 --> 00:21:29.04
to strike back.

373
00:21:29.04 --> 00:21:34.52
But as it did historically with the British and World War two, it put fire in their

374
00:21:34.52 --> 00:21:35.52
belly.

375
00:21:35.52 --> 00:21:38.04
It was absolutely the worst thing we could do in Vietnam.

376
00:21:38.04 --> 00:21:41.52
It gave them a tonic to fight harder.

377
00:21:41.52 --> 00:21:48.44
So we've covered that on the podcast about how the brits, when the brits got bombed,

378
00:21:48.44 --> 00:21:51.92
psychologically it made them tougher.

379
00:21:51.92 --> 00:21:54.12
Because there's something happening.

380
00:21:54.12 --> 00:21:56.52
Look, this massive attack comes.

381
00:21:56.52 --> 00:21:59.28
Well, it seems like a massive attack and something you can't control something you can't

382
00:21:59.28 --> 00:22:01.08
fight back.

383
00:22:01.08 --> 00:22:06.80
But when you bomb a city of a million people, there's actually a small number that actually

384
00:22:06.80 --> 00:22:08.12
get impacted by it.

385
00:22:08.12 --> 00:22:11.04
So everyone else goes, hey, we can survive this.

386
00:22:11.04 --> 00:22:13.12
And so that's what happened with the Vietnamese.

387
00:22:13.12 --> 00:22:14.36
They owe you drop these giant bombs.

388
00:22:14.36 --> 00:22:15.84
Let's guess what I'm still here.

389
00:22:15.84 --> 00:22:16.84
You can't do anything to me.

390
00:22:16.84 --> 00:22:19.84
America, big America with your big bombs.

391
00:22:19.84 --> 00:22:21.72
I'm still right here.

392
00:22:21.72 --> 00:22:22.72
What do you got?

393
00:22:22.72 --> 00:22:36.08
Now, I'll tell you what, if the recent fighting in Iraq against ISIS, there's been a

394
00:22:36.08 --> 00:22:41.64
lot of bombing in the bombing has been, let's just say it was a very, very productive,

395
00:22:41.64 --> 00:22:48.16
very, very productive and they killed a lot, a lot, thousands and tens of thousands

396
00:22:48.16 --> 00:22:50.36
of ISIS fighters.

397
00:22:50.36 --> 00:22:54.76
And even what that being said, there was ground forces that had to move in, but man, they

398
00:22:54.76 --> 00:22:59.16
did a lot of devastating, devastating destruction of the enemy without stuff.

399
00:22:59.16 --> 00:23:05.92
So I think in certain situations, you can have a massive impact with firepower.

400
00:23:05.92 --> 00:23:10.80
But isn't that like, like I said, like, isn't that like because of intelligence that they

401
00:23:10.80 --> 00:23:15.30
had and stuff like there was more to it than just, hey, let's just, yeah, yeah, it was

402
00:23:15.30 --> 00:23:16.30
a bunch of people.

403
00:23:16.30 --> 00:23:19.08
And the ISIS were easier targets.

404
00:23:19.08 --> 00:23:23.72
Not only easier targets, but better weaponry.

405
00:23:23.72 --> 00:23:27.44
Because man, if you look at the number, like, I remember reading something about a bridge

406
00:23:27.44 --> 00:23:32.12
that they were trying to take out in Vietnam and they launched mission after mission after

407
00:23:32.12 --> 00:23:36.000
mission after mission and drop bomb after bomb after bomb after it's hard.

408
00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:41.12
It was hard back then to actually hit something like a bridge with a bomb.

409
00:23:41.12 --> 00:23:42.36
God, yeah, okay.

410
00:23:42.36 --> 00:23:43.36
You know what I'm saying?

411
00:23:43.36 --> 00:23:45.36
Well, I have to get Dave Burke on here.

412
00:23:45.36 --> 00:23:46.36
Good deal, Dave.

413
00:23:46.36 --> 00:23:47.36
Yeah, good deal, Dave.

414
00:23:47.36 --> 00:23:52.28
Good, him on here and talk about how hard that is to with dumb bombs.

415
00:23:52.28 --> 00:23:54.24
Because you know, everyone says smart bombs now.

416
00:23:54.24 --> 00:23:55.24
Yeah.

417
00:23:55.24 --> 00:23:56.24
Those were dumb bombs.

418
00:23:56.24 --> 00:23:57.88
You had to basically, you got to eyeball it.

419
00:23:57.88 --> 00:23:58.88
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

420
00:23:58.88 --> 00:23:59.88
You're like, I've all missed a few.

421
00:23:59.88 --> 00:24:00.88
Imagine how hard that is.

422
00:24:00.88 --> 00:24:05.92
Like, okay, we get that if you just want to bomb this general, this city, right?

423
00:24:05.92 --> 00:24:06.92
You can just drop bombs on the city.

424
00:24:06.92 --> 00:24:08.32
Okay, I get you can hit that.

425
00:24:08.32 --> 00:24:09.92
But you're trying to hit a bridge.

426
00:24:09.92 --> 00:24:10.92
Yeah.

427
00:24:10.92 --> 00:24:12.28
Can you imagine how hard that's got to be?

428
00:24:12.28 --> 00:24:14.84
Yeah, I do because I used to play this game called Mario Kart.

429
00:24:14.84 --> 00:24:15.84
Right.

430
00:24:15.84 --> 00:24:18.96
Like a split screen and it's the tracking to get these weapons.

431
00:24:18.96 --> 00:24:19.96
Right.

432
00:24:19.96 --> 00:24:22.72
And you're playing your friend who's sitting right next to you because it's a split screen.

433
00:24:22.72 --> 00:24:24.12
And you can pick up these weapons.

434
00:24:24.12 --> 00:24:26.24
So two of the weapons were the turtle shell.

435
00:24:26.24 --> 00:24:28.40
Is it red one and a green one?

436
00:24:28.40 --> 00:24:30.16
The red one was a smart turtle shell.

437
00:24:30.16 --> 00:24:32.56
It like seek the other guy out.

438
00:24:32.56 --> 00:24:35.20
But the green one just went in the exact direction that you shot it.

439
00:24:35.20 --> 00:24:37.40
So imagine you're on a track.

440
00:24:37.40 --> 00:24:38.40
You're taking turns.

441
00:24:38.40 --> 00:24:39.96
It's way harder with a green shell.

442
00:24:39.96 --> 00:24:40.96
Yeah.

443
00:24:40.96 --> 00:24:42.76
So back in Vietnam was a green shell.

444
00:24:42.76 --> 00:24:43.76
Yeah.

445
00:24:43.76 --> 00:24:44.76
Not as we got the red shell.

446
00:24:44.76 --> 00:24:46.32
I fully understand this.

447
00:24:46.32 --> 00:24:48.32
It's the same thing.

448
00:24:48.32 --> 00:24:49.32
Check.

449
00:24:49.32 --> 00:24:51.32
All right.

450
00:24:51.32 --> 00:24:53.52
With that, we'll go back to the interview.

451
00:24:53.52 --> 00:24:55.24
Next question.

452
00:24:55.24 --> 00:24:58.72
When you were active in the May Kong Delta, it was difficult to tell who was the

453
00:24:58.72 --> 00:25:00.20
one who was the one who was civilian.

454
00:25:00.20 --> 00:25:01.20
Hackworth.

455
00:25:01.20 --> 00:25:08.52
I was in the ninth division and our commander was General Julian Eul who was called the

456
00:25:08.52 --> 00:25:10.80
butcher of the Delta.

457
00:25:10.80 --> 00:25:13.28
The policy of the division was that it didn't matter.

458
00:25:13.28 --> 00:25:16.000
If it moved, shoot it and then count it.

459
00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:20.56
Theoretically civilians were supposed to be away from the battle area.

460
00:25:20.56 --> 00:25:25.04
They would say this as a free fire zone.

461
00:25:25.04 --> 00:25:29.04
But without realizing the tradition of the people to go back to their homestead.

462
00:25:29.04 --> 00:25:33.96
So regardless of the danger, they would go back to where their ancestors were and then

463
00:25:33.96 --> 00:25:37.92
they were considered via Kong and Fair game.

464
00:25:37.92 --> 00:25:41.96
There were an enormous number of casualties who were civilians, but all the civilians,

465
00:25:41.96 --> 00:25:46.12
you have to understand, we're sympathetic, certainly in my part of the Delta to the

466
00:25:46.12 --> 00:25:48.52
Viet Kong effort.

467
00:25:48.52 --> 00:25:51.92
Most of the people in the rural areas of Vietnam were sympathetic to the Viet Kong

468
00:25:51.92 --> 00:25:52.92
cause.

469
00:25:52.92 --> 00:25:56.92
They had won the hearts and minds of the Vietnamese people.

470
00:25:56.92 --> 00:25:58.92
They felt that their cause was more just.

471
00:25:58.92 --> 00:26:03.28
It had a more nationalistic purpose.

472
00:26:03.28 --> 00:26:04.28
Question.

473
00:26:04.28 --> 00:26:08.000
You will once flying in a helicopter over the Delta and you saw some people running along

474
00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:10.28
and you fought their civilians, their children.

475
00:26:10.28 --> 00:26:11.28
Hackworth.

476
00:26:11.28 --> 00:26:15.72
They were doing what's called Eagle Flies, which is a platoon of infantry helicopters.

477
00:26:15.72 --> 00:26:19.68
Five, six soldiers per helicopter and I was controlling everything in a command.

478
00:26:19.68 --> 00:26:25.08
A control helicopter, the pilot in the front seat of my helicopter said, there are four

479
00:26:25.08 --> 00:26:28.80
enemies streaking across the field, request permission to fire.

480
00:26:28.80 --> 00:26:32.08
As commander, I would grant that permission.

481
00:26:32.08 --> 00:26:34.000
I looked down and I saw four little kids.

482
00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:36.20
So I said negative, those are little kids.

483
00:26:36.20 --> 00:26:38.20
They're just playing hokey from school or something.

484
00:26:38.20 --> 00:26:40.04
Leave them alone.

485
00:26:40.04 --> 00:26:44.04
I went ahead and inserted my platoon and let them maneuver through the area.

486
00:26:44.04 --> 00:26:49.04
Suddenly they took fire from those poor little kids who were probably no more than 12

487
00:26:49.04 --> 00:26:52.76
or 13 years old and it stashed their AK 47s.

488
00:26:52.76 --> 00:26:55.64
So I was wrong.

489
00:26:55.64 --> 00:26:59.56
My previous experience had been up in the highlands.

490
00:26:59.56 --> 00:27:03.72
That was one of my first days in the Delta and I was learning that just about anybody

491
00:27:03.72 --> 00:27:11.24
in that battlefield sadly enough was a hostel.

492
00:27:11.24 --> 00:27:13.24
Question were they ever helpful to you?

493
00:27:13.24 --> 00:27:14.24
Hackworth.

494
00:27:14.24 --> 00:27:15.92
Again, he hits it here.

495
00:27:15.92 --> 00:27:23.48
60% of all casualties, 60% of all US casualties during that war were from mines and booby

496
00:27:23.48 --> 00:27:29.000
traps that were set out by these local people who had built them and installed them.

497
00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:33.000
Ironically enough, the top generals never counted those people as part of the enemies

498
00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:38.20
order of battle, even though they accounted for about 300,000 people.

499
00:27:38.20 --> 00:27:41.56
They were conveniently dropped from the walls.

500
00:27:41.56 --> 00:27:45.24
They were only counted when they were found dead.

501
00:27:45.24 --> 00:27:50.88
Going into any battle area, if we picked up a civilian, he became our point man against

502
00:27:50.88 --> 00:27:52.84
the Geneva Convention.

503
00:27:52.84 --> 00:27:57.52
The assumption was that if this cat lived here, he knew how to get through this area

504
00:27:57.52 --> 00:28:02.64
without losing a leg or a life he could lead our forces through.

505
00:28:02.64 --> 00:28:09.20
So that's again, we've covered this a bunch, but the local populace, they're walking through

506
00:28:09.20 --> 00:28:12.76
these trail every single day and they're not hitting any booby traps and then you lose

507
00:28:12.76 --> 00:28:14.80
a guide today, you lose a guide of moral.

508
00:28:14.80 --> 00:28:18.60
Eventually you realize that they add a minimum, they know where these booby traps are.

509
00:28:18.60 --> 00:28:23.16
And Hackworth's saying they're the ones that set them up, made them and set them up.

510
00:28:23.16 --> 00:28:26.44
Oh yeah, so it mentioned against the Geneva Convention.

511
00:28:26.44 --> 00:28:28.20
Yeah, to grab a civilian.

512
00:28:28.20 --> 00:28:31.08
So they're sort of grabbing them and what forcing them to do it.

513
00:28:31.08 --> 00:28:33.96
Hey, you're gonna walk, you're gonna walk out in front of you.

514
00:28:33.96 --> 00:28:36.04
You're gonna take us through this trail.

515
00:28:36.04 --> 00:28:37.32
Like a host of some sort of stuff.

516
00:28:37.32 --> 00:28:38.60
Yeah, I almost like a host of source.

517
00:28:38.60 --> 00:28:38.60
Yeah.

518
00:28:38.60 --> 00:28:45.52
Next question, what was a simple booby trap?

519
00:28:45.52 --> 00:28:48.12
Well the Pungi steak was a no-brainer.

520
00:28:48.12 --> 00:28:51.16
Normally they were setting a position where they would strike your ankle.

521
00:28:51.16 --> 00:28:54.60
It would scratch you, you were in filthy water, you'd get an infection.

522
00:28:54.60 --> 00:28:56.88
I had a Pungi wound and I didn't know it.

523
00:28:56.88 --> 00:28:58.68
I must have gotten the morning and it bled a lot.

524
00:28:58.68 --> 00:29:01.72
I didn't know until I got out of the water and looked at my boot and it was soaking

525
00:29:01.72 --> 00:29:03.04
red from blood.

526
00:29:03.04 --> 00:29:07.32
There was a wound that looked very much like as if someone had taken a razor and made

527
00:29:07.32 --> 00:29:10.56
about a three inch long slash in my leg.

528
00:29:10.56 --> 00:29:11.56
It became infected.

529
00:29:11.56 --> 00:29:13.20
That was the problem.

530
00:29:13.20 --> 00:29:15.40
It wasn't a long term wound.

531
00:29:15.40 --> 00:29:17.24
There was something that put you down for a few days.

532
00:29:17.24 --> 00:29:22.32
It had to be cleaned out, debridled, then it would be stitched up and you were fine.

533
00:29:22.32 --> 00:29:28.64
The real killer was the coffee can filled with explosives from a dud American round.

534
00:29:28.64 --> 00:29:31.92
Everything they used, we gave them.

535
00:29:31.92 --> 00:29:34.48
We threw away our sea ration cans.

536
00:29:34.48 --> 00:29:36.12
We threw away our used batteries.

537
00:29:36.12 --> 00:29:38.20
We threw away our coffee cans.

538
00:29:38.20 --> 00:29:43.16
If a 500-bound bomb didn't explode, that provided them with a raw materials for their

539
00:29:43.16 --> 00:29:44.72
booby traps.

540
00:29:44.72 --> 00:29:47.16
So they set up their booby trap factory.

541
00:29:47.16 --> 00:29:48.60
They opened up the mine.

542
00:29:48.60 --> 00:29:51.20
They took out the explosives, packed it in a can.

543
00:29:51.20 --> 00:29:56.04
Rapped barbed wire and nails and other things around it got a primer device from a grenade

544
00:29:56.04 --> 00:30:00.52
that was left behind, put a trip wire on it and set it on the side of the road.

545
00:30:00.52 --> 00:30:05.16
When the first soldier hit it, he would lose his life and maybe three or four people

546
00:30:05.16 --> 00:30:07.48
behind him would be down.

547
00:30:07.48 --> 00:30:13.36
I've seen what we call number 10 cans, the large cans packed full of sea for and so filled

548
00:30:13.36 --> 00:30:19.96
with nails to have a fragment effect that it could take down 10 or 12 people.

549
00:30:19.96 --> 00:30:24.56
The impact on the soldier was a psychological impact.

550
00:30:24.56 --> 00:30:29.32
But every time you put your foot down, you didn't know whether you're going to have a leg,

551
00:30:29.32 --> 00:30:31.92
a limb or a life.

552
00:30:31.92 --> 00:30:40.44
And this played over and over for 365 days of going down trails, going down waterways.

553
00:30:40.44 --> 00:30:42.96
It took the fight out of you.

554
00:30:42.96 --> 00:30:45.68
I took over the battalion down at the delta.

555
00:30:45.68 --> 00:30:51.40
It was called the hard luck battalion in six months before I took it over and had 600 casualties

556
00:30:51.40 --> 00:30:58.36
killed in a wounded, all from mines and booby traps, it had never met the enemy.

557
00:30:58.36 --> 00:31:03.32
It was all from these incidious little devices put down by these people that the generals

558
00:31:03.32 --> 00:31:09.52
didn't count because they didn't understand the nature of the war.

559
00:31:09.52 --> 00:31:10.72
Yeah.

560
00:31:10.72 --> 00:31:21.36
And I think the numbers for Iraq was 75% of the casualties were from IEDs, 75% off

561
00:31:21.36 --> 00:31:22.36
to confirm that.

562
00:31:22.36 --> 00:31:25.04
But whatever it was, it's a huge number.

563
00:31:25.04 --> 00:31:27.48
It's a huge number.

564
00:31:27.48 --> 00:31:32.48
It must be an odd feeling to find that, you know, like dang they made that bomb out of

565
00:31:32.48 --> 00:31:33.48
our stuff.

566
00:31:33.48 --> 00:31:38.32
Like, especially at first, when you use two of these different, like you're like, what

567
00:31:38.32 --> 00:31:43.16
if you came across the results of a bomb and it's like dang I was just using that coffee

568
00:31:43.16 --> 00:31:45.88
can, you know, like two days ago or something like that.

569
00:31:45.88 --> 00:31:49.88
Well, yeah, that's why discipline soldiers wouldn't leave anything behind ever.

570
00:31:49.88 --> 00:31:50.88
Yeah.

571
00:31:50.88 --> 00:31:53.48
But lack of discipline soldiers would leave all this stuff.

572
00:31:53.48 --> 00:31:56.12
Now, sometimes you drop bombs and they don't detonate.

573
00:31:56.12 --> 00:31:59.24
That's, so they can't really fall for anyone for that.

574
00:31:59.24 --> 00:32:00.60
But yeah, coffee cans.

575
00:32:00.60 --> 00:32:06.72
And they, they, they, they taught us when I, when I was going through training, they taught

576
00:32:06.72 --> 00:32:08.64
us like we weren't allowed to leave anything behind.

577
00:32:08.64 --> 00:32:09.64
Yeah.

578
00:32:09.64 --> 00:32:12.76
Couldn't leave anything behind because we didn't want the enemy to use it.

579
00:32:12.76 --> 00:32:13.76
Yeah.

580
00:32:13.76 --> 00:32:14.76
It's the way it was.

581
00:32:14.76 --> 00:32:17.20
And you know what, you know what, the Iraqis, the Iraqis did the same thing.

582
00:32:17.20 --> 00:32:21.28
The insurgents, the insurgents, the Iraq they used old ordinance.

583
00:32:21.28 --> 00:32:27.36
Now, some of the old ordinance that they used was actually from the old Iraqi army.

584
00:32:27.36 --> 00:32:31.32
A lot of it, but a lot of it was from unexplored ordinance, just like what the Vietnamese

585
00:32:31.32 --> 00:32:32.32
would be a calling used.

586
00:32:32.32 --> 00:32:33.32
Yeah.

587
00:32:33.32 --> 00:32:39.76
And even to me, it kind of seems like even if it wasn't stuff to use like, I mean, man,

588
00:32:39.76 --> 00:32:43.12
it's a spectrum, like some, you know, hot like when, you know, on the movie where the

589
00:32:43.12 --> 00:32:46.36
criminal, they're chasing the criminal with the dogs and the criminal left part of his

590
00:32:46.36 --> 00:32:49.12
shirt or something and the dog sort of smells it.

591
00:32:49.12 --> 00:32:52.76
It's like that feeling like your enemy has like something in yours, right?

592
00:32:52.76 --> 00:32:56.88
So he from one side of the spectrum is like, okay, they use it to make bombs, right?

593
00:32:56.88 --> 00:33:00.08
Which is kind of just maybe psychologically just kind of odd.

594
00:33:00.08 --> 00:33:05.16
And then just the fact that, for example, like what if in Iraq, you capture somebody or

595
00:33:05.16 --> 00:33:09.48
whatever, any has like a pair of like some old army boots or something.

596
00:33:09.48 --> 00:33:10.48
Oh, yeah, for sure.

597
00:33:10.48 --> 00:33:15.32
But there's the, well, I'd say, yeah, that's, that's a, I see it hitting you.

598
00:33:15.32 --> 00:33:17.96
And I'm trying to figure out why this is kind of shocking to you.

599
00:33:17.96 --> 00:33:20.16
And it must be the first time you've ever thought about this.

600
00:33:20.16 --> 00:33:21.16
Yeah.

601
00:33:21.16 --> 00:33:22.16
Yeah.

602
00:33:22.16 --> 00:33:25.16
So for me, like for instance, this was horrible.

603
00:33:25.16 --> 00:33:28.04
So just think about this.

604
00:33:28.04 --> 00:33:33.68
There was an element of snipers that got overrun and Romadi.

605
00:33:33.68 --> 00:33:37.48
And so think about what the enemy got.

606
00:33:37.48 --> 00:33:39.96
Sniper weapons, night vision.

607
00:33:39.96 --> 00:33:43.92
That's always like your horrified night vision goggles and sniper weapons.

608
00:33:43.92 --> 00:33:48.16
So that takes what you were just talking about and multiplies it times a lot.

609
00:33:48.16 --> 00:33:49.16
Yeah.

610
00:33:49.16 --> 00:33:55.40
But he's now the enemy has legitimate equipment that puts them a little bit higher on the

611
00:33:55.40 --> 00:33:57.44
tactical level.

612
00:33:57.44 --> 00:33:59.000
So that's definitely scary.

613
00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:06.72
And that's why we're so careful about never leaving anything behind.

614
00:34:06.72 --> 00:34:09.28
Next question.

615
00:34:09.28 --> 00:34:13.80
What did these sorts of casualties do to the morale of American soldiers?

616
00:34:13.80 --> 00:34:16.04
Just blew it away.

617
00:34:16.04 --> 00:34:18.28
Just like a mind blew away a leg.

618
00:34:18.28 --> 00:34:19.88
It just played with your mind.

619
00:34:19.88 --> 00:34:24.000
Months after I left Vietnam, I found myself walking across an open field and I suddenly

620
00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:26.28
said where am I and froze.

621
00:34:26.28 --> 00:34:29.28
In my mind, I was in a mind field.

622
00:34:29.28 --> 00:34:32.60
It took a few minutes for me to work out that I was not in a mind field.

623
00:34:32.60 --> 00:34:37.52
I believe that a lot of this so-called Vietnam stress syndrome that has created so many

624
00:34:37.52 --> 00:34:43.000
walking wounded across America today is due to the damage caused long ago by what they saw

625
00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:47.24
of their mates going down by minds and booby traps.

626
00:34:47.24 --> 00:34:53.08
Remember of the 60,000 dead and 300,000 Americans wound in that war, 60% were from minds

627
00:34:53.08 --> 00:34:54.08
and booby traps.

628
00:34:54.08 --> 00:34:56.48
He driving that point home.

629
00:34:56.48 --> 00:35:02.44
The great irony was that the infantry soldiers who went to Vietnam received a total

630
00:35:02.44 --> 00:35:06.16
of five hours of training in minds and booby traps.

631
00:35:06.16 --> 00:35:09.04
That was the curriculum used in World War II.

632
00:35:09.04 --> 00:35:16.04
We simply didn't learn.

633
00:35:16.04 --> 00:35:17.36
I can tell you, they turned up.

634
00:35:17.36 --> 00:35:21.12
I mean, when I was running training, we went crazy with IEDs.

635
00:35:21.12 --> 00:35:24.60
Our fake IEDs, but yeah, we would get nuts with them.

636
00:35:24.60 --> 00:35:26.80
We'd put them all over the place.

637
00:35:26.80 --> 00:35:29.80
And just you had to figure it out.

638
00:35:29.80 --> 00:35:30.80
Yeah, to be careful.

639
00:35:30.80 --> 00:35:36.16
But I'll tell you, man, it is hard when someone's good at making those IEDs and camouflaging

640
00:35:36.16 --> 00:35:37.16
them.

641
00:35:37.16 --> 00:35:38.16
Boo.

642
00:35:38.16 --> 00:35:39.16
Scary.

643
00:35:39.16 --> 00:35:40.16
Yeah.

644
00:35:40.16 --> 00:35:44.36
We'd have to like, brief the training cadre over and over again to make sure that

645
00:35:44.36 --> 00:35:46.36
training cadre didn't set off the IEDs.

646
00:35:46.36 --> 00:35:47.36
Yeah.

647
00:35:47.36 --> 00:35:49.36
We would be building.

648
00:35:49.36 --> 00:35:54.98
Next, what was the purpose of the Vietcong tunnels in the sort of Kuchi area north of

649
00:35:54.98 --> 00:35:56.28
Saigon, hackworth?

650
00:35:56.28 --> 00:36:00.48
The purpose of the tunnels is to provide safe areas for supplies, for their headquarters

651
00:36:00.48 --> 00:36:02.24
and for their soldiers.

652
00:36:02.24 --> 00:36:06.000
A great casualty producer for them was artillery.

653
00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:09.44
Their bombing and machine gun strikes from aircraft and helicopters.

654
00:36:09.44 --> 00:36:14.08
Most of the tunnels were located in areas that had great limestone formations.

655
00:36:14.08 --> 00:36:17.88
It was easy to dig in, but still quite strong and easy to shore up.

656
00:36:17.88 --> 00:36:22.32
They could go down two, three, four, actual floors.

657
00:36:22.32 --> 00:36:27.32
With pumped in air and brought in water, it gave them a secure area that was really behind

658
00:36:27.32 --> 00:36:29.36
the American lines.

659
00:36:29.36 --> 00:36:32.48
And the Americans never really worked out that they were there.

660
00:36:32.48 --> 00:36:35.12
For example, there was a place called the Iron Triangle.

661
00:36:35.12 --> 00:36:39.72
There was a great number of such tunnels and a general named Williamson took a brigade in

662
00:36:39.72 --> 00:36:42.56
there and said the Iron Triangle is no more.

663
00:36:42.56 --> 00:36:46.96
That was in 1965 at the beginning of the American involvement in the war.

664
00:36:46.96 --> 00:36:51.24
When the North seized the country and they went, when they won the war in 1975, their

665
00:36:51.24 --> 00:36:57.68
headquarters was in the Iron Triangle in those very caves.

666
00:36:57.68 --> 00:37:00.56
That's like another situation.

667
00:37:00.56 --> 00:37:06.28
You call this area secure and the enemy has actually has their headquarters there.

668
00:37:06.28 --> 00:37:07.28
Crazy.

669
00:37:07.28 --> 00:37:12.16
Next question, wasn't it possible to block up the tunnels or gas them or blow them up?

670
00:37:12.16 --> 00:37:16.36
Hackworth, we tried everything possible to destroy the tunnels, including having small

671
00:37:16.36 --> 00:37:20.000
soldiers called tunnel rats go down and try and clear them.

672
00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:24.24
But they were so cleverly done, you could never find where the actual end was.

673
00:37:24.24 --> 00:37:28.12
There would be a dead end with a hidden door going down to the next level.

674
00:37:28.12 --> 00:37:32.000
And I'm sure that if enough creativity and effort had gone into it, then yes, they could

675
00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:33.000
have been closed up.

676
00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:36.44
But the top generals were not concerned.

677
00:37:36.44 --> 00:37:41.08
An anecdote, a cave expert came to me between my tours in Vietnam and my office in the

678
00:37:41.08 --> 00:37:42.08
Pentagon.

679
00:37:42.08 --> 00:37:44.12
He said, look, I can help you in the war.

680
00:37:44.12 --> 00:37:48.20
I can tell you where the caves are because this is something I've studied my whole life.

681
00:37:48.20 --> 00:37:52.12
I took him to my boss and Vietnam veteran who was very excited about it.

682
00:37:52.12 --> 00:37:56.52
We took him to our general and he didn't want to know about it.

683
00:37:56.52 --> 00:38:01.80
He wants to waste money sending this guy over there and having examined tunnels and caves.

684
00:38:01.80 --> 00:38:03.52
What's he going to tell us?

685
00:38:03.52 --> 00:38:07.92
Again, it was the mentality that firepower will win the war.

686
00:38:07.92 --> 00:38:11.84
These great outpourings of American industrial strength will win this war.

687
00:38:11.84 --> 00:38:20.84
This arrogance didn't allow us to get beyond a blinkered military mindset.

688
00:38:20.84 --> 00:38:22.40
Good advice for life.

689
00:38:22.40 --> 00:38:28.20
This is something that with actual unfraining working with a lot of businesses.

690
00:38:28.20 --> 00:38:30.32
Sometimes your strategy is wrong.

691
00:38:30.32 --> 00:38:32.92
It was the sort of happening Iraq with us.

692
00:38:32.92 --> 00:38:37.28
Your strategy was not working and it took us some time to figure that out and start

693
00:38:37.28 --> 00:38:39.48
doing a counter insurgency campaign.

694
00:38:39.48 --> 00:38:41.80
But I see this with businesses a lot too.

695
00:38:41.80 --> 00:38:45.60
They're using some strategy and it's not working.

696
00:38:45.60 --> 00:38:47.72
But maybe they used it 12 years ago.

697
00:38:47.72 --> 00:38:49.32
Maybe they used it two years ago.

698
00:38:49.32 --> 00:38:53.96
It worked and they were celebrated and now they're just going to do it harder.

699
00:38:53.96 --> 00:38:56.16
Do the same strategy more.

700
00:38:56.16 --> 00:38:58.16
Seems like that's the case with marketing.

701
00:38:58.16 --> 00:39:00.56
Marketing just changes so much.

702
00:39:00.56 --> 00:39:05.64
Like when you're marketed to the new strategies, it's not obvious.

703
00:39:05.64 --> 00:39:08.92
The old strategy is like dordidour salesmen.

704
00:39:08.92 --> 00:39:11.08
Dordidour salesmen comes to your house now.

705
00:39:11.08 --> 00:39:13.36
Bro, you don't want to hear it.

706
00:39:13.36 --> 00:39:14.76
Why did you come to my house?

707
00:39:14.76 --> 00:39:18.20
That's like when that begins to just a complete waste because you've got to pay some

708
00:39:18.20 --> 00:39:21.68
kid for whatever, 12 bucks an hour to go dordidour.

709
00:39:21.68 --> 00:39:25.72
Whereas you can pay 12 bucks and send out of, I don't know, email or something.

710
00:39:25.72 --> 00:39:26.72
Yeah, but even emails.

711
00:39:26.72 --> 00:39:28.16
Well, yeah, that's the point.

712
00:39:28.16 --> 00:39:29.16
What's the new deal?

713
00:39:29.16 --> 00:39:31.16
I don't know Facebook ads.

714
00:39:31.16 --> 00:39:32.16
I don't know.

715
00:39:32.16 --> 00:39:33.16
Even that's kind of old now.

716
00:39:33.16 --> 00:39:35.16
But the, um, no, dordidour.

717
00:39:35.16 --> 00:39:37.04
There was a time where dordidour was dope.

718
00:39:37.04 --> 00:39:40.68
You know, as funny as I still talk to people that will go out and make stuff happen dordidour.

719
00:39:40.68 --> 00:39:42.28
Well, so now it's old school again.

720
00:39:42.28 --> 00:39:43.28
Right?

721
00:39:43.28 --> 00:39:44.28
Old schools coming back.

722
00:39:44.28 --> 00:39:47.32
Here's the thing usually dordidour seems like a heart cell.

723
00:39:47.32 --> 00:39:51.28
So sure, they'll make things happen, but it's not as efficient as other ways like

724
00:39:51.28 --> 00:39:52.28
newer ways of marketing.

725
00:39:52.28 --> 00:39:55.40
Yeah, these people come to my house dordidour people.

726
00:39:55.40 --> 00:39:56.56
They want us to own these stuff.

727
00:39:56.56 --> 00:39:58.24
Yeah, how many times have you bought?

728
00:39:58.24 --> 00:39:59.24
Zero.

729
00:39:59.24 --> 00:40:00.60
Yeah, so that's the point.

730
00:40:00.60 --> 00:40:01.60
But let me come see you.

731
00:40:01.60 --> 00:40:05.84
I'm trying to keep running through my mind to see if that was a solid answer.

732
00:40:05.84 --> 00:40:09.24
I'm actually, I'm actually pretty sure that in the last 20 years, I bought zero from

733
00:40:09.24 --> 00:40:10.24
dordidour salesman.

734
00:40:10.24 --> 00:40:11.24
Right.

735
00:40:11.24 --> 00:40:12.88
And that's probably common.

736
00:40:12.88 --> 00:40:13.88
Yeah.

737
00:40:13.88 --> 00:40:16.04
I mean, consider the feeling you have when someone comes to your make.

738
00:40:16.04 --> 00:40:17.96
But there's some people that make money.

739
00:40:17.96 --> 00:40:18.96
Obviously.

740
00:40:18.96 --> 00:40:19.96
Yeah, yeah.

741
00:40:19.96 --> 00:40:24.12
Yeah, and I'm not saying no, I work with some companies where they do dordidour

742
00:40:24.12 --> 00:40:25.12
sales.

743
00:40:25.12 --> 00:40:27.12
They got some good sales kids.

744
00:40:27.12 --> 00:40:28.96
They're selling a good product.

745
00:40:28.96 --> 00:40:29.96
Yeah.

746
00:40:29.96 --> 00:40:31.28
They're like, OK, we're going to get this out there.

747
00:40:31.28 --> 00:40:32.28
Right.

748
00:40:32.28 --> 00:40:33.28
So, I'm not going to get it.

749
00:40:33.28 --> 00:40:34.28
I dig it.

750
00:40:34.28 --> 00:40:39.64
But there was a time back in the day when dordidour was kind of the dope thing.

751
00:40:39.64 --> 00:40:40.64
It's OK.

752
00:40:40.64 --> 00:40:44.64
And when you think about it, it would make sense because dordidour, like back long time,

753
00:40:44.64 --> 00:40:47.04
where a man would be able to come over, they just knock on the door.

754
00:40:47.04 --> 00:40:49.40
There wasn't cell phone or nothing like that.

755
00:40:49.40 --> 00:40:51.96
If they were super courteous, they'd call before they came.

756
00:40:51.96 --> 00:40:54.84
But if that's your neighbor, your friend or whatever, people would not go into the

757
00:40:54.84 --> 00:40:55.84
other time.

758
00:40:55.84 --> 00:40:57.32
Now, people don't just show up at your door.

759
00:40:57.32 --> 00:40:58.32
Yeah, that's true.

760
00:40:58.32 --> 00:40:59.48
Go out there because they're lazy also.

761
00:40:59.48 --> 00:41:00.48
Yeah.

762
00:41:00.48 --> 00:41:01.48
I'm sorry.

763
00:41:01.48 --> 00:41:02.48
Tax, yeah.

764
00:41:02.48 --> 00:41:03.48
Yeah, I call you home.

765
00:41:03.48 --> 00:41:04.64
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

766
00:41:04.64 --> 00:41:08.64
So, but back in the day, dordidour salesman, they were put it this way.

767
00:41:08.64 --> 00:41:11.000
They weren't as unwelcome as they are now.

768
00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:12.000
Right.

769
00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:13.76
So, as a work, there was more random people showing up at your house.

770
00:41:13.76 --> 00:41:15.32
Yeah, for there's a bunch of reasons.

771
00:41:15.32 --> 00:41:21.20
This one's same, but the point is back in the day, that marketing technique or that sales

772
00:41:21.20 --> 00:41:25.28
technique or whatever was more effective than it is now.

773
00:41:25.28 --> 00:41:26.76
I'm not saying it's a zero effective.

774
00:41:26.76 --> 00:41:29.16
Not saying it's way more, you know, it's the things change.

775
00:41:29.16 --> 00:41:34.36
So if you're a company, you're like, hey, I think dordidour is the way to go because back

776
00:41:34.36 --> 00:41:38.08
in, you know, 75, we were killing, you know, kind of thing.

777
00:41:38.08 --> 00:41:39.36
Well, that was what's interesting.

778
00:41:39.36 --> 00:41:43.72
So, going back to Iraq and going away from dordidour sales here for a moment.

779
00:41:43.72 --> 00:41:44.72
Yeah.

780
00:41:44.72 --> 00:41:48.68
The, that was interesting about the surge.

781
00:41:48.68 --> 00:41:51.68
What was the surge was not just more people.

782
00:41:51.68 --> 00:41:53.08
It was new strategy.

783
00:41:53.08 --> 00:41:57.08
It was more counter-insurgency focused strategy.

784
00:41:57.08 --> 00:42:06.76
And luckily, that we shifted that strategy because it wasn't going well up until that point.

785
00:42:06.76 --> 00:42:07.76
Next question.

786
00:42:07.76 --> 00:42:11.96
But these tunnels were militarily significant orn't they?

787
00:42:11.96 --> 00:42:19.000
Backworth, they were running sore from the beginning to the end and they were a very powerful

788
00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:21.000
ally of the vehicle.

789
00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:24.80
Question, you were in the state at the time it happened, but do you remember hearing about

790
00:42:24.80 --> 00:42:26.92
the Ted offense of in 1968?

791
00:42:26.92 --> 00:42:31.40
Hackworth, when the Ted offense have occurred in 1968, I was in the Pentagon.

792
00:42:31.40 --> 00:42:35.24
A dear friend of mine was an aide to a very senior general, so he was privy to a lot

793
00:42:35.24 --> 00:42:38.88
of information that we Indians didn't have.

794
00:42:38.88 --> 00:42:44.32
The low ranking guys, as opposed to the chiefs Indians.

795
00:42:44.32 --> 00:42:48.52
He came and whispered in my ear and he told me about the attack long before hours before

796
00:42:48.52 --> 00:42:51.44
anyone in the press or public knew anything about it.

797
00:42:51.44 --> 00:42:54.60
I was quite frankly shocked and heartbroken.

798
00:42:54.60 --> 00:42:58.60
I had been convinced for two years that the vehicle we're going to win the war.

799
00:42:58.60 --> 00:43:01.80
That the Americans simply didn't understand the nature of the war.

800
00:43:01.80 --> 00:43:06.28
It was very much epitomized when Walter Cronkite asked the American people what the hell

801
00:43:06.28 --> 00:43:10.56
is going on here, I thought we were winning the war.

802
00:43:10.56 --> 00:43:13.40
That was the kind of shock it was to the American people.

803
00:43:13.40 --> 00:43:20.16
Everyone had been fed these glowing afteraction reports by the president, Lyndon Johnson,

804
00:43:20.16 --> 00:43:27.88
by General West Morland that there was light at the end of the tunnel that we were prevailing,

805
00:43:27.88 --> 00:43:29.92
that it would only be a matter of months.

806
00:43:29.92 --> 00:43:33.52
The American public was still oriented towards World War II.

807
00:43:33.52 --> 00:43:37.16
They were believing that as long as we grabbed this real estate, we would eventually

808
00:43:37.16 --> 00:43:39.48
find the light at the end of the tunnel.

809
00:43:39.48 --> 00:43:43.48
But the light at the end of the tunnel was a vehicle on freight train coming on full

810
00:43:43.48 --> 00:43:44.48
bore.

811
00:43:44.48 --> 00:43:50.64
That's what we discovered in TET of 1968 and that was the turning point of the war.

812
00:43:50.64 --> 00:43:52.64
Question why was it the turning point?

813
00:43:52.64 --> 00:43:53.64
Hackworth.

814
00:43:53.64 --> 00:43:57.56
TET was a turning point because it destroyed the will of the American people to support

815
00:43:57.56 --> 00:44:00.08
the war.

816
00:44:00.08 --> 00:44:05.96
Those soldiers who were in the no realized that this was just the beginning of the end.

817
00:44:05.96 --> 00:44:08.72
We saw that the American people switched off.

818
00:44:08.72 --> 00:44:13.68
If the support of the people is not there, you are going to be cut off of the legs and

819
00:44:13.68 --> 00:44:18.72
that's exactly what happened in Vietnam.

820
00:44:18.72 --> 00:44:25.28
And this is when I was on that show on the history channel, the warriors show and I talked

821
00:44:25.28 --> 00:44:30.28
about how you have to have the will to kill and the will to die and to show about markedly.

822
00:44:30.28 --> 00:44:37.44
And that's where that quote, that statement that I made is rooted in what I learned from

823
00:44:37.44 --> 00:44:38.44
Macworth.

824
00:44:38.44 --> 00:44:40.24
That is you have to have this will.

825
00:44:40.24 --> 00:44:43.80
You have to have the will and the people, the nation has to have the will.

826
00:44:43.80 --> 00:44:45.44
It's not just the military has to have the will.

827
00:44:45.44 --> 00:44:46.44
It's the people.

828
00:44:46.44 --> 00:44:52.76
Because what is the military, the military is the people.

829
00:44:52.76 --> 00:44:57.24
Back to the interview, there had been a fair amount of support for the war until

830
00:44:57.24 --> 00:44:58.88
10th of 1968.

831
00:44:58.88 --> 00:45:04.88
People thought it would be unpatriotic not to hang in there and wait until we grab a noi.

832
00:45:04.88 --> 00:45:09.68
When the people saw a veetcon climbing on the top of the American embassy, they knew that

833
00:45:09.68 --> 00:45:11.72
they'd been lied to.

834
00:45:11.72 --> 00:45:14.24
Then they knew that this war was not winnable.

835
00:45:14.24 --> 00:45:18.44
All they had to do is ask their sons by that time, probably a million Americans had

836
00:45:18.44 --> 00:45:22.84
served in Vietnam and it come back home and told their parents and loved ones the truth about

837
00:45:22.84 --> 00:45:23.84
the war.

838
00:45:23.84 --> 00:45:30.52
The government couldn't just provide it with a Madison Avenue Snow job anymore.

839
00:45:30.52 --> 00:45:33.88
Question, could the war have been won?

840
00:45:33.88 --> 00:45:35.76
Could the veetcon have been beaten?

841
00:45:35.76 --> 00:45:36.76
Hackworth.

842
00:45:36.76 --> 00:45:41.24
The war could not have been won, unless the host country, the Sagan government, the

843
00:45:41.24 --> 00:45:46.16
South Vietnamese changed their very repressive form of government and won the hearts and minds

844
00:45:46.16 --> 00:45:48.20
of the people.

845
00:45:48.20 --> 00:45:52.72
After the northern government had employed this technique and they had created the promise

846
00:45:52.72 --> 00:45:56.72
of this utopian dream as soon as they kicked out the invader, this repressive South

847
00:45:56.72 --> 00:45:58.36
Vietnamese government.

848
00:45:58.36 --> 00:46:04.12
The South Vietnamese government never understood what never understood that they had to make

849
00:46:04.12 --> 00:46:06.72
those changes.

850
00:46:06.72 --> 00:46:09.92
They were led by greedy people who were into making money.

851
00:46:09.92 --> 00:46:12.32
They had no contact with the people in the main.

852
00:46:12.32 --> 00:46:17.32
They were mainly Catholics and they were in to, and they were trying to rule a country that

853
00:46:17.32 --> 00:46:21.64
was 90% Buddhist.

854
00:46:21.64 --> 00:46:24.52
Question, why was body count so important?

855
00:46:24.52 --> 00:46:26.08
Or was it?

856
00:46:26.08 --> 00:46:27.08
Hackworth.

857
00:46:27.08 --> 00:46:32.16
McNamara was a number cruncher and he wanted to have something to crunch a number.

858
00:46:32.16 --> 00:46:37.12
The overall strategy was attrition to wear out the enemy by counting bodies we would

859
00:46:37.12 --> 00:46:41.16
know the impact of the war its success or failure.

860
00:46:41.16 --> 00:46:43.88
That became the standard measurement of success.

861
00:46:43.88 --> 00:46:47.40
It was the score and everyone wanted to know the score.

862
00:46:47.40 --> 00:46:52.44
What really happened was the body count counting completely eroded the honor code of the

863
00:46:52.44 --> 00:46:55.56
military specifically among the officer corps.

864
00:46:55.56 --> 00:46:58.60
It taught people to lie.

865
00:46:58.60 --> 00:47:02.12
The young fresh lieutenant out of the military academies were taught to lie.

866
00:47:02.12 --> 00:47:06.64
The generals who were pretty proficient lieers anyway pushed the body count.

867
00:47:06.64 --> 00:47:09.000
A high body count meant great success.

868
00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:13.32
So in every battle enemy bodies were counted several times.

869
00:47:13.32 --> 00:47:18.56
If there were 200 bodies, suddenly the figure became 650 and it became to quote Westmoreland

870
00:47:18.56 --> 00:47:21.72
another great American victory.

871
00:47:21.72 --> 00:47:26.60
It corrupted the officer corps and appalled the soldiers who by that time were mostly

872
00:47:26.60 --> 00:47:27.76
drafted.

873
00:47:27.76 --> 00:47:32.24
They were scurrying around the jungle counting bodies which was a pretty awesome and terrible

874
00:47:32.24 --> 00:47:33.24
thing to do.

875
00:47:33.24 --> 00:47:37.20
It had a real boomerang effect on the military because it was like a cancer.

876
00:47:37.20 --> 00:47:38.68
It destroyed its soul.

877
00:47:38.68 --> 00:47:51.92
What was the military strategy of the war?

878
00:47:51.92 --> 00:47:52.92
Hackworth.

879
00:47:52.92 --> 00:47:58.16
Westmoreland's idea was to destroy the enemy's large battle formations as in World War II.

880
00:47:58.16 --> 00:48:02.24
When you've worn the enemy down, you've won on the field of battle.

881
00:48:02.24 --> 00:48:06.16
That tells you that we simply didn't understand the nature of the war because the guerrilla

882
00:48:06.16 --> 00:48:08.28
was not going to fight in that way.

883
00:48:08.28 --> 00:48:12.44
The guerrilla's manner of fighting was to hit and run so he could be alive to fight another

884
00:48:12.44 --> 00:48:13.44
day.

885
00:48:13.44 --> 00:48:16.12
He was an into these huge stand-up battles.

886
00:48:16.12 --> 00:48:20.32
Big operations required a great number of resources, a great amount of logistics, a great

887
00:48:20.32 --> 00:48:25.60
amount of aircraft and a great amount of artillery fire.

888
00:48:25.60 --> 00:48:31.08
Most Diane, who is the chief staff of the Israeli army, came to Vietnam and I interviewed

889
00:48:31.08 --> 00:48:36.12
him right after he had spent two weeks with an American rifle company of about 100 men.

890
00:48:36.12 --> 00:48:41.64
He said that in one battle, with a North Vietnamese force of a couple hundred men, they fired

891
00:48:41.64 --> 00:48:48.92
more artillery over 25,000 rounds than he had fired in a whole campaign.

892
00:48:48.92 --> 00:48:51.64
That was the American way of fighting a war.

893
00:48:51.64 --> 00:48:53.28
It was also terribly expensive.

894
00:48:53.28 --> 00:48:55.12
Each round was a hundred dollars.

895
00:48:55.12 --> 00:48:59.96
If you fired 10,000 rounds, you've probably gone through a million dollars in one 15 minute

896
00:48:59.96 --> 00:49:04.12
fight and you've killed seven enemy.

897
00:49:04.12 --> 00:49:09.16
When you look at it from a cost basis, we were paying an enormous amount to kill the enemy

898
00:49:09.16 --> 00:49:15.000
and we couldn't sustain that kind of momentum and that kind of expenditure for a long time.

899
00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:17.68
It was a failed tactic that never should have been used.

900
00:49:17.68 --> 00:49:23.36
We should have used the same rules that Mao was teaching, that Sun Su taught before, to break

901
00:49:23.36 --> 00:49:27.24
up in small elements and fight fire with fire.

902
00:49:27.24 --> 00:49:35.52
You know, you think about that economic you pay a million dollars to kill seven enemy soldiers.

903
00:49:35.52 --> 00:49:37.16
That's your...

904
00:49:37.16 --> 00:49:43.36
It's not going to work out well, I'm a long run.

905
00:49:43.36 --> 00:49:45.40
Question, had you been in charge?

906
00:49:45.40 --> 00:49:47.32
How would you have done things differently?

907
00:49:47.32 --> 00:49:51.24
Hackworth, during my second year in Vietnam, I commanded a battalion made up of conscripts

908
00:49:51.24 --> 00:49:52.24
down in the Delta.

909
00:49:52.24 --> 00:49:54.56
It was a battalion with very bad leadership.

910
00:49:54.56 --> 00:49:58.28
It sustained 600 casualties in the six months before I took over.

911
00:49:58.28 --> 00:50:03.28
Morales low, they called themselves the Hark Brick Battalion.

912
00:50:03.28 --> 00:50:06.12
Within 30 days they turned around and of course we've covered this on steel.

913
00:50:06.12 --> 00:50:09.64
My soldier charged her in by hackworth about this experience and we also covered it in

914
00:50:09.64 --> 00:50:13.40
about face, which he covers that as well about this experience.

915
00:50:13.40 --> 00:50:15.52
So I'm moving a little bit quicker here.

916
00:50:15.52 --> 00:50:17.000
We fought like gorillas.

917
00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:19.20
We didn't fight in these huge formations.

918
00:50:19.20 --> 00:50:22.68
We broke up and fought in small units of five or seven people.

919
00:50:22.68 --> 00:50:26.80
We fought at night, we stole the night from the enemy, we ambushed, we didn't march

920
00:50:26.80 --> 00:50:32.48
in large formations and expect to meet an opponent marching in large formations.

921
00:50:32.48 --> 00:50:35.88
We fought him using his very tactics, his very skills.

922
00:50:35.88 --> 00:50:38.52
We tore a page out of Mao's book.

923
00:50:38.52 --> 00:50:43.52
The proof of the pudding was six months later that the battalion had only lost 25 American

924
00:50:43.52 --> 00:50:44.52
soldiers.

925
00:50:44.52 --> 00:50:52.000
It had killed over 2600 enemy soldiers and there were no via Kong in the area of operation.

926
00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:57.28
Those soldiers proudly called themselves the hardcore battalion and they were hardcore,

927
00:50:57.28 --> 00:51:02.56
but they were simply simple drafties who didn't want to be there.

928
00:51:02.56 --> 00:51:05.16
Question, are you sure that was an accurate body count?

929
00:51:05.16 --> 00:51:06.16
Harkworth.

930
00:51:06.16 --> 00:51:10.52
Yeah, I think that was an accurate body count considering the inflated body count techniques

931
00:51:10.52 --> 00:51:14.12
employed by the US military at the time.

932
00:51:14.12 --> 00:51:17.60
Question, wasn't the fight because it's a little ironic that he talks about how bad the body

933
00:51:17.60 --> 00:51:19.32
count is and then he uses it.

934
00:51:19.32 --> 00:51:23.80
So he's kind of getting called out on that a little bit.

935
00:51:23.80 --> 00:51:26.88
He should have just stuck to the fact that there was no more via Kong operations in that

936
00:51:26.88 --> 00:51:27.88
area.

937
00:51:27.88 --> 00:51:32.08
There used to be X amount of enemy attacks today and now there was zero.

938
00:51:32.08 --> 00:51:33.88
Sorry, Hark, come on.

939
00:51:33.88 --> 00:51:37.96
Don't worry, I got you.

940
00:51:37.96 --> 00:51:44.28
Wasn't the fighting from 72 to 75 more like a more like conventional warfare.

941
00:51:44.28 --> 00:51:45.28
Harkworth.

942
00:51:45.28 --> 00:51:46.28
It was conventional warfare.

943
00:51:46.28 --> 00:51:50.60
A gorilla campaign starts with a few people who are dissatisfied.

944
00:51:50.60 --> 00:51:51.84
They throw rocks at the enemy.

945
00:51:51.84 --> 00:51:54.52
They finally kill an enemy soldier and get a rifle.

946
00:51:54.52 --> 00:51:57.56
They get more rifles and they raid an armory and they get more weapons and they build and

947
00:51:57.56 --> 00:51:59.36
build up.

948
00:51:59.36 --> 00:52:04.72
Phase one of a gorilla campaign is individual sniping, laying booby traps and low-scale conflict

949
00:52:04.72 --> 00:52:05.72
type fighting.

950
00:52:05.72 --> 00:52:13.04
The final goal, phase, the final goal in phase four or five is to move in brigades and divisions

951
00:52:13.04 --> 00:52:19.08
and cause an conventional formation and that's the culmination of the war.

952
00:52:19.08 --> 00:52:24.36
Which is interesting to think about when it's like one of those situations where what

953
00:52:24.36 --> 00:52:27.28
made you strong you leave behind.

954
00:52:27.28 --> 00:52:28.68
It happens with companies all the time.

955
00:52:28.68 --> 00:52:31.84
This company starts off there small, but nimble they can adapt to the market and then

956
00:52:31.84 --> 00:52:33.08
over time they get so big.

957
00:52:33.08 --> 00:52:34.08
They can't change anymore.

958
00:52:34.08 --> 00:52:38.28
And then some other company that was a start up is now a small nimble and can take advantage

959
00:52:38.28 --> 00:52:40.40
of the changes in the market.

960
00:52:40.40 --> 00:52:41.40
Same thing happens.

961
00:52:41.40 --> 00:52:49.16
Unless you pay attention, unless you keep yourself, unless you enact decentralized command

962
00:52:49.16 --> 00:52:53.24
and you can provide it, you can keep if you start decentralized everything.

963
00:52:53.24 --> 00:52:56.64
What you have to get somewhat more centralized when you grow like that.

964
00:52:56.64 --> 00:53:01.28
One thing is in the military you say, well we've got decentralized command.

965
00:53:01.28 --> 00:53:05.64
Well part of that, part of the reason we have that we can let people have decentralized

966
00:53:05.64 --> 00:53:09.16
command is because we have the discipline training up front.

967
00:53:09.16 --> 00:53:14.12
So once a company as a company grows, if you put discipline on them, you can allow them

968
00:53:14.12 --> 00:53:16.64
to still have decentralized command and act very quickly.

969
00:53:16.64 --> 00:53:19.72
You've got to have trust in your subordinate leadership.

970
00:53:19.72 --> 00:53:25.08
For sure, to be able to employ that.

971
00:53:25.08 --> 00:53:29.40
Next question, but the actual defeat of the Southern government was by the North Vietnamese

972
00:53:29.40 --> 00:53:30.92
regular army.

973
00:53:30.92 --> 00:53:32.52
That was hardly a viet con victory.

974
00:53:32.52 --> 00:53:34.72
Was it hack worth?

975
00:53:34.72 --> 00:53:41.12
Oh, I think that the architect of that general tray was a viet con, a southerner.

976
00:53:41.12 --> 00:53:42.48
He was the one that planned it.

977
00:53:42.48 --> 00:53:44.000
There were a number of viet con divisions.

978
00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:48.40
For example, the ninth viet con division in the Delta fought in the final battles as a regular

979
00:53:48.40 --> 00:53:49.40
unit.

980
00:53:49.40 --> 00:53:53.92
Sure, the majority were regular forces from the North, but they fought in hit and run

981
00:53:53.92 --> 00:53:55.68
type operations.

982
00:53:55.68 --> 00:53:57.88
They always fought on the offensive.

983
00:53:57.88 --> 00:54:00.08
That is interesting to note.

984
00:54:00.08 --> 00:54:09.16
Is that of 100% of all contacts when one guy attacks another 85% were enemy initiated.

985
00:54:09.16 --> 00:54:15.20
That means that throughout the war, the Americans were on the defensive 85% of the time.

986
00:54:15.20 --> 00:54:19.60
And the enemy, the viet con, and the North Vietnamese was on the offensive.

987
00:54:19.60 --> 00:54:22.40
You can't win a war by being on the defense.

988
00:54:22.40 --> 00:54:24.80
You have to have the offensive power.

989
00:54:24.80 --> 00:54:28.24
We didn't have the initiative throughout the war from beginning to end the initiative

990
00:54:28.24 --> 00:54:33.20
rested in the hands of the opponent, the viet con, and the North Vietnamese.

991
00:54:33.20 --> 00:54:38.92
That's like in jujitsu when someone is just attacking and attacking and attacking.

992
00:54:38.92 --> 00:54:39.92
You're defending the whole time.

993
00:54:39.92 --> 00:54:40.92
You're going down immediately.

994
00:54:40.92 --> 00:54:41.92
Yeah.

995
00:54:41.92 --> 00:54:43.44
You're going down eventually.

996
00:54:43.44 --> 00:54:50.56
And that was something that we definitely changed up for my last point when we were

997
00:54:50.56 --> 00:54:54.44
in Ramadi with tasking a bruiser.

998
00:54:54.44 --> 00:54:56.84
Whenever you're on patrol, you're on defensive.

999
00:54:56.84 --> 00:54:57.84
You're on the defensive.

1000
00:54:57.84 --> 00:55:01.28
You set up a little overwatch position and you're waiting for the enemy patrol.

1001
00:55:01.28 --> 00:55:02.52
Now you're ambushing them.

1002
00:55:02.52 --> 00:55:03.76
So now you're on the offense.

1003
00:55:03.76 --> 00:55:08.24
So I mean, we weren't on offense 85% of the time.

1004
00:55:08.24 --> 00:55:10.96
But we were on offense a lot of the time.

1005
00:55:10.96 --> 00:55:16.64
The boys were getting out on offense and surprising the enemy on a regular basis.

1006
00:55:16.64 --> 00:55:19.60
I mean, probably more than half the time.

1007
00:55:19.60 --> 00:55:22.84
Because we were also doing things where we were on the defensive.

1008
00:55:22.84 --> 00:55:26.16
I mean, it's offensive and defensive at the same time when you're pushing through a,

1009
00:55:26.16 --> 00:55:29.60
when you're doing a clearance operation, you're on offense, but you're on defense.

1010
00:55:29.60 --> 00:55:31.16
Because the enemy's waiting for you.

1011
00:55:31.16 --> 00:55:32.16
Yeah.

1012
00:55:32.16 --> 00:55:35.28
So there's a little dichotomy in doing that type of mission.

1013
00:55:35.28 --> 00:55:39.40
But like doing a direct action mission where you're going to go and take down a building

1014
00:55:39.40 --> 00:55:44.56
where you think there's a bad guy, you're offensive when you get to that target.

1015
00:55:44.56 --> 00:55:48.16
But while you're going to the target, you're waiting to get ambushed.

1016
00:55:48.16 --> 00:55:49.16
You're waiting to get ambushed.

1017
00:55:49.16 --> 00:55:50.44
That's what you're doing.

1018
00:55:50.44 --> 00:55:52.44
Even though you're scanning, even though you're looking for threats, you're still

1019
00:55:52.44 --> 00:55:54.96
waiting to get ambushed, you're waiting to roll over an ID.

1020
00:55:54.96 --> 00:55:58.56
Even though you feel like you're on offense and we train our guys to be an offense,

1021
00:55:58.56 --> 00:56:04.96
the reality is the first shot in those situations is absolutely going to be fired by the enemy.

1022
00:56:04.96 --> 00:56:06.96
The ID is going to be initiated by the enemy.

1023
00:56:06.96 --> 00:56:11.36
And once you do the raid, the raid itself, that's us being on offense, right?

1024
00:56:11.36 --> 00:56:14.96
They're in their sleep being or they're not expecting you to come and boom,

1025
00:56:14.96 --> 00:56:17.96
you blow their door off and you enter their house, you're on offense.

1026
00:56:17.96 --> 00:56:19.96
But that's like four minutes.

1027
00:56:19.96 --> 00:56:22.96
So you're saying before that before that while you're going to the target.

1028
00:56:22.96 --> 00:56:24.96
Because they like protected themselves with whatever.

1029
00:56:24.96 --> 00:56:26.96
No, you're still unrelated.

1030
00:56:26.96 --> 00:56:28.96
Like let's say you're going for a bad guy.

1031
00:56:28.96 --> 00:56:31.96
Bad guy X and he lives in the house.

1032
00:56:31.96 --> 00:56:33.96
You know you're going to get him.

1033
00:56:33.96 --> 00:56:36.96
And when you get there, you're going to surprise him and he's not going to be expecting you.

1034
00:56:36.96 --> 00:56:44.96
But on the way there, that guy Z, bad guy M and bad guy F have all set up ambushes on this road.

1035
00:56:44.96 --> 00:56:47.96
Not maybe completely disconnected with bad guy X.

1036
00:56:47.96 --> 00:56:51.96
But you are going to have to go through the ambushes that they've set.

1037
00:56:51.96 --> 00:56:54.96
And they don't care, they'll set up that ambush tonight.

1038
00:56:54.96 --> 00:56:55.96
No one comes, okay, cool.

1039
00:56:55.96 --> 00:56:56.96
We'll set up tomorrow night.

1040
00:56:56.96 --> 00:56:57.96
No one comes, we'll set up tomorrow night.

1041
00:56:57.96 --> 00:57:00.96
You only got to go down that one road one time to get ambushed.

1042
00:57:00.96 --> 00:57:02.96
So you're on.

1043
00:57:02.96 --> 00:57:05.96
So when you're going, when you're when you're moving through enemy territory,

1044
00:57:05.96 --> 00:57:07.96
you are on defense.

1045
00:57:07.96 --> 00:57:10.96
Again, that's not the mindset we teach.

1046
00:57:10.96 --> 00:57:13.96
The mindset is like, we're on offense, we're going to go get some.

1047
00:57:13.96 --> 00:57:18.96
The reality is the first shot is going to be most likely, most likely,

1048
00:57:18.96 --> 00:57:21.96
fired by the enemy, most likely.

1049
00:57:21.96 --> 00:57:26.96
That's the way it is.

1050
00:57:26.96 --> 00:57:32.96
And we did, I mean, these big clearance, these big sector clearance that we were doing,

1051
00:57:32.96 --> 00:57:33.96
the army was doing the ringgroom.

1052
00:57:33.96 --> 00:57:37.96
And like I said, you're on offense, if it's an offensive push, you're making the initiative.

1053
00:57:37.96 --> 00:57:43.96
You're taking the initiative and getting in there on an operational level on a tactical level.

1054
00:57:43.96 --> 00:57:46.96
Most likely, the enemy is going to see you first.

1055
00:57:46.96 --> 00:57:49.96
They're hitting, they're hiding, they're two rooms deep in a building.

1056
00:57:49.96 --> 00:57:52.96
They're they're waiting and they've got an ID buried in the road.

1057
00:57:52.96 --> 00:57:57.96
So so offensive is kind of when you think about it, it's just like a mindset,

1058
00:57:57.96 --> 00:58:03.96
kind of mainly to begin with because it's like a, it's like a forward leaning mindset.

1059
00:58:03.96 --> 00:58:07.96
I think an offense means you often says you strike first.

1060
00:58:07.96 --> 00:58:09.96
It's, you have the initiative.

1061
00:58:09.96 --> 00:58:11.96
That's often, when you have the initiative, that's often.

1062
00:58:11.96 --> 00:58:14.96
When you're reacting, that's defense.

1063
00:58:14.96 --> 00:58:20.96
Yeah, so like in your situation that you're like, so if I punch you, I was on offense.

1064
00:58:20.96 --> 00:58:21.96
Right? Yeah.

1065
00:58:21.96 --> 00:58:25.96
If you don't punch me, I just, I was on defense.

1066
00:58:25.96 --> 00:58:29.96
So yours was like, a pump, but you weren't punching.

1067
00:58:29.96 --> 00:58:30.96
Yeah, it's interesting.

1068
00:58:30.96 --> 00:58:36.96
Yeah, it's, it's harder, I guess, really get the capture, the actual, how you would explain that.

1069
00:58:36.96 --> 00:58:39.96
I think the best I could do is when I just said, operationally you're on offense.

1070
00:58:39.96 --> 00:58:40.96
Right.

1071
00:58:40.96 --> 00:58:41.96
Meaning we're pushing into your neighborhood.

1072
00:58:41.96 --> 00:58:43.96
Yeah, so that's essentially what's like this.

1073
00:58:43.96 --> 00:58:51.96
Like this, if you had a bar, you were the bounce right at a bar, and I had a beef with you, I showed up at your bar.

1074
00:58:51.96 --> 00:58:52.96
Right? Right.

1075
00:58:52.96 --> 00:58:55.96
But once I get there and get in your face, boom, you crack me.

1076
00:58:55.96 --> 00:58:56.96
You just went on offense.

1077
00:58:56.96 --> 00:58:57.96
Right.

1078
00:58:57.96 --> 00:59:02.96
Or even better, while I'm going to your bar, one of your boys steps out of the alleyway because he was waiting for me.

1079
00:59:02.96 --> 00:59:03.96
Yeah.

1080
00:59:03.96 --> 00:59:05.96
Cracks me with the ball on the back of the head.

1081
00:59:05.96 --> 00:59:06.96
Right.

1082
00:59:06.96 --> 00:59:08.96
So it'll be ready for people like you could.

1083
00:59:08.96 --> 00:59:09.96
Yeah.

1084
00:59:09.96 --> 00:59:10.96
So now we got another thing you got to come to the way.

1085
00:59:10.96 --> 00:59:11.96
So there's different orders.

1086
00:59:11.96 --> 00:59:13.96
They better kill me.

1087
00:59:13.96 --> 00:59:15.96
They better stay better kill me.

1088
00:59:15.96 --> 00:59:17.96
You and deep into the urinary of them.

1089
00:59:17.96 --> 00:59:18.96
I'm just saying.

1090
00:59:18.96 --> 00:59:19.96
I'm cool.

1091
00:59:19.96 --> 00:59:20.96
There it is.

1092
00:59:23.96 --> 00:59:25.96
Try and be on offense.

1093
00:59:25.96 --> 00:59:26.96
Yeah.

1094
00:59:26.96 --> 00:59:34.96
If you at least, the lesson to be learned there for me, if you're at least think about it, at least think about that you want to be on offense.

1095
00:59:34.96 --> 00:59:35.96
Right.

1096
00:59:35.96 --> 00:59:39.96
And that was always nice about these, you know, a lot of the missions that we did in Iraq

1097
00:59:39.96 --> 00:59:41.96
is like we were surprising the enemy.

1098
00:59:41.96 --> 00:59:42.96
Yeah.

1099
00:59:42.96 --> 00:59:44.96
And if you can surprise the enemy, you're on offense.

1100
00:59:44.96 --> 00:59:45.96
Yeah.

1101
00:59:45.96 --> 00:59:46.96
So yeah.

1102
00:59:46.96 --> 00:59:51.96
So like even like you're back to your, um, example, your your missions.

1103
00:59:51.96 --> 00:59:56.96
Just the fact that you initiated that capture kill mission, that's your offensive.

1104
00:59:56.96 --> 00:59:57.96
That's offensive movement.

1105
00:59:57.96 --> 00:59:57.96
Yeah.

1106
00:59:57.96 --> 01:00:00.96
But just like when I'm coming to the bar, I got to get to the bar.

1107
01:00:00.96 --> 01:00:01.96
Right.

1108
01:00:01.96 --> 01:00:03.96
One defense from the get in their center, and one will get hit.

1109
01:00:03.96 --> 01:00:04.96
Right.

1110
01:00:04.96 --> 01:00:06.96
So it's like throwing a punch with that with that other hand up.

1111
01:00:06.96 --> 01:00:11.96
It's important to note that we would teach our guys to have an offensive mindset, meaning when we,

1112
01:00:11.96 --> 01:00:19.96
would you saw one of our patrols, or one of our vehicle patrols, or a foot patrol, you see every guy ready to engage the enemy.

1113
01:00:19.96 --> 01:00:20.96
Yeah.

1114
01:00:20.96 --> 01:00:23.96
Most likely the first shot's going to come from.

1115
01:00:23.96 --> 01:00:24.96
Yeah.

1116
01:00:24.96 --> 01:00:25.96
Did that happen all the time?

1117
01:00:25.96 --> 01:00:26.96
No.

1118
01:00:26.96 --> 01:00:32.96
There's sometimes we, you know, on a patrol, guys would engage first or that could happen, but most likely that that's luck.

1119
01:00:32.96 --> 01:00:36.96
Because most likely the enemy is a little bit smarter, they're hiding in a, you know, when you're walking,

1120
01:00:36.96 --> 01:00:40.96
think about when you walk down the street, think of how many windows there are, how many doors there are.

1121
01:00:40.96 --> 01:00:46.96
So now you just walk down a street, and how many windows can you see 200, 300, right?

1122
01:00:46.96 --> 01:00:51.96
I mean, if you're walking down a city street, you can see a hundred windows.

1123
01:00:51.96 --> 01:00:56.96
Let's say one of those windows could have a bad guy in it, and you can't, you're not going to see him.

1124
01:00:56.96 --> 01:00:57.96
Yeah.

1125
01:00:57.96 --> 01:00:58.96
He's going to see you first.

1126
01:00:58.96 --> 01:00:59.96
Yeah.

1127
01:00:59.96 --> 01:01:00.96
So.

1128
01:01:00.96 --> 01:01:02.96
Check.

1129
01:01:02.96 --> 01:01:10.16
Next question in April of 1975, during the fall of Saigon, there were some memorable images of American

1130
01:01:10.16 --> 01:01:14.96
helicopters taking off from the roof of the American embassy in dozens of South Vietnamese trying to escape.

1131
01:01:14.96 --> 01:01:17.96
What were your feelings when you saw those pictures?

1132
01:01:17.96 --> 01:01:18.96
Hackworth.

1133
01:01:18.96 --> 01:01:23.96
I was heartbroken when I saw the end come and the helicopters airlifting people off the embassy.

1134
01:01:23.96 --> 01:01:30.94
But at the same time in 1971 when I left Vietnam, I said four years from now, the North Vietnamese were fly up to

1135
01:01:30.94 --> 01:01:32.94
Flag over this capital.

1136
01:01:32.94 --> 01:01:38.94
The reason I said that, and I was dead on to the month, was that I had been like a doctor

1137
01:01:38.94 --> 01:01:43.94
feeling the pulse of a dying patient, and it was obvious to me that this patient, the South Vietnamese

1138
01:01:43.94 --> 01:01:46.94
government, was on its way down.

1139
01:01:46.94 --> 01:01:53.94
Question was the April 1975 victory of victory for the people's style of war.

1140
01:01:53.94 --> 01:01:54.94
Hackworth.

1141
01:01:54.94 --> 01:01:58.94
I think that the victory in Vietnam introduced a new phase of warfare where low intensity

1142
01:01:58.94 --> 01:02:01.94
conflict can eventually win.

1143
01:02:01.94 --> 01:02:02.94
Question.

1144
01:02:02.94 --> 01:02:06.94
What was what does the concept of a people's war mean to you?

1145
01:02:06.94 --> 01:02:07.94
Hackworth.

1146
01:02:07.94 --> 01:02:10.94
It's the same thing that my forefathers employed in 1776.

1147
01:02:10.94 --> 01:02:15.94
We wanted independence, and we were willing to pay with our lives.

1148
01:02:15.94 --> 01:02:21.94
All people want to be free, and if they have that anger inside them and the ability to arm themselves,

1149
01:02:21.94 --> 01:02:26.94
and somebody comes along and says, hey, I'm your leader, and I'm going to show you how to do this.

1150
01:02:26.94 --> 01:02:33.94
Then the one guy who's trying to suppress them is in trouble.

1151
01:02:33.94 --> 01:02:34.94
Question.

1152
01:02:34.94 --> 01:02:39.94
What are the key lessons to be learned from the V.I.C. success?

1153
01:02:39.94 --> 01:02:44.94
And actually before we go into that question, if you think about this from a leadership perspective,

1154
01:02:44.94 --> 01:02:46.94
we all wanted independence.

1155
01:02:46.94 --> 01:02:52.94
We all want to be free, and if somebody comes along and tries to dictate to you how things are going to be,

1156
01:02:52.94 --> 01:02:54.94
that person's in trouble.

1157
01:02:54.94 --> 01:03:00.94
Right? So as a leader, if you try and impose your will on people, look, can you get away with it? Yes.

1158
01:03:00.94 --> 01:03:10.94
Yes. Does it work if you're in the, you know, if you can fire someone or yes, but to be actually lead someone, you can't just try and impose your will on top of them.

1159
01:03:10.94 --> 01:03:12.94
You can get them in the game too.

1160
01:03:12.94 --> 01:03:13.94
Next question.

1161
01:03:13.94 --> 01:03:18.94
How important was mass mobilization to the success of the V.I.C.

1162
01:03:18.94 --> 01:03:20.94
Hackworth.

1163
01:03:20.94 --> 01:03:24.94
If you're going to fight a war today, you're going to need your whole nation behind you.

1164
01:03:24.94 --> 01:03:33.94
Either as fighters or supporters or carriers, it's no longer the act of a few soldiers fighting on a sunny hill, waving swords at one another.

1165
01:03:33.94 --> 01:03:41.94
Warfare is now the employment of the complete population. The V.I.C. took on two superpowers, France and the United States,

1166
01:03:41.94 --> 01:03:44.94
and they couldn't have done it on a shoestring.

1167
01:03:44.94 --> 01:03:50.94
They needed to mobilize everything within their nation, and they needed to get as much outside support as possible.

1168
01:03:50.94 --> 01:03:58.94
At the end, the war became almost a conventional war. One of the things that bothers me is that the Americans who are now trying to rewrite history of what actually happened,

1169
01:03:58.94 --> 01:04:02.94
say we won all the battles, but we lost the war.

1170
01:04:02.94 --> 01:04:05.94
But we didn't win all the battles. We lost most of the battles.

1171
01:04:05.94 --> 01:04:09.94
This is really, this is really critical, and this is a very important thing to think about.

1172
01:04:09.94 --> 01:04:15.94
The reason they've come up with this very bad rationale is because of the American way of keeping score.

1173
01:04:15.94 --> 01:04:22.94
In the old American way of conventional warfare, if you're king of the mountain at the end of the day, you've won the battle.

1174
01:04:22.94 --> 01:04:24.94
But to the V.I.C.

1175
01:04:24.94 --> 01:04:29.94
It wasn't who held the ground. It was what kind of punishment you inflicted on your enemy.

1176
01:04:29.94 --> 01:04:35.94
The V.I.C. and North Vietnamese were willing to pay an easy, easy ratio of 10 to 1.

1177
01:04:35.94 --> 01:04:42.94
If you fought him and you lost one soldier and he lost 10, he walked away saying, I was the winner.

1178
01:04:42.94 --> 01:04:50.94
There's the mentality that you have to understand, and that's why you have to be willing to kill, and you have to be willing to die if you're going to go to war.

1179
01:04:50.94 --> 01:04:53.94
That's why right there.

1180
01:04:53.94 --> 01:05:04.94
Question. Can parallels be drawn between Afghanistan and Vietnam, between the V.I.C. and the Americans and the Mujahideen War success?

1181
01:05:04.94 --> 01:05:06.94
Against the Soviets?

1182
01:05:06.94 --> 01:05:08.94
Hackworth? Absolutely.

1183
01:05:08.94 --> 01:05:13.94
There's no question that there are sharp parallels between the Afghan war and the war in Vietnam.

1184
01:05:13.94 --> 01:05:17.94
The fighters, there were freedom fighters.

1185
01:05:17.94 --> 01:05:20.94
They were trying to rid themselves of communism.

1186
01:05:20.94 --> 01:05:22.94
They were supported by an outside country.

1187
01:05:22.94 --> 01:05:25.94
This time the USA who poured billions of dollars into that war.

1188
01:05:25.94 --> 01:05:29.94
They tried to win by using an enormous amount of firepower.

1189
01:05:29.94 --> 01:05:33.94
Conventional tactics against the search and destroy operation.

1190
01:05:33.94 --> 01:05:37.94
A high degree of technology. All the mistakes that the Soviets made in Afghanistan.

1191
01:05:37.94 --> 01:05:42.94
The Americans made in Vietnam and the French made in Indochina.

1192
01:05:42.94 --> 01:05:46.94
No one looked back on the lessons learned.

1193
01:05:46.94 --> 01:05:49.94
Did the Soviets learn anything from America's experience?

1194
01:05:49.94 --> 01:05:52.94
No one looked back on the lessons learned.

1195
01:05:52.94 --> 01:05:55.94
Did the Soviets learn anything from America's experience?

1196
01:05:55.94 --> 01:05:59.94
Did the Soviets learn anything from America's experience in Vietnam?

1197
01:05:59.94 --> 01:06:03.94
Hackworth? From my analysis of the war, I'd say very little.

1198
01:06:03.94 --> 01:06:07.94
They tried to win the war by using firepower by bombing them back the stone age

1199
01:06:07.94 --> 01:06:09.94
through the use of American provided stinger missiles.

1200
01:06:09.94 --> 01:06:13.94
And by mounting machine guns in high mountains and firing down on aircraft,

1201
01:06:13.94 --> 01:06:20.94
they made the price so heavy for the Soviets in terms of cost that they blinked first and got out.

1202
01:06:20.94 --> 01:06:25.94
Again, they used an incredible number of mines and booby traps,

1203
01:06:25.94 --> 01:06:28.94
creating a great number of Soviet casualties.

1204
01:06:28.94 --> 01:06:33.94
The Soviet units did that did well there, where special units led by people

1205
01:06:33.94 --> 01:06:36.94
who understood that form of wealth warfare.

1206
01:06:36.94 --> 01:06:41.94
But their conventional infantry was exactly the same as the American conventionally

1207
01:06:41.94 --> 01:06:45.94
of the Korean Vietnam or the French conventionally in the Indochina.

1208
01:06:45.94 --> 01:06:51.94
Question, why did the Soviets fail to learn from the American and French mistakes?

1209
01:06:51.94 --> 01:06:55.94
Hackworth? I think it is a military mindset.

1210
01:06:55.94 --> 01:06:58.94
We don't want to go back and look at the past.

1211
01:06:58.94 --> 01:07:01.94
We're in such a hurry to get where we're going.

1212
01:07:01.94 --> 01:07:05.94
There's a certain amount of military arrogance.

1213
01:07:05.94 --> 01:07:10.94
The older I get, the more I realize how we never study the past and try to learn from it,

1214
01:07:10.94 --> 01:07:14.94
we just stumble along and make the same mistakes.

1215
01:07:14.94 --> 01:07:18.94
We're doomed to do that until people wake up.

1216
01:07:18.94 --> 01:07:24.94
And with the military mind, I'm not sure it will ever wake up.

1217
01:07:24.94 --> 01:07:28.94
Gotta keep your ego in check.

1218
01:07:28.94 --> 01:07:31.94
Gotta learn from the past.

1219
01:07:31.94 --> 01:07:33.94
100% erect.

1220
01:07:33.94 --> 01:07:39.94
Question, is there anything about guerrilla warfare which is new to this century?

1221
01:07:39.94 --> 01:07:41.94
Hackworth, well a number of things are new.

1222
01:07:41.94 --> 01:07:45.94
The amount of firepower that the insurgent employees and uses, the use of booby traps and mines,

1223
01:07:45.94 --> 01:07:49.94
the ability to communicate via electronic communications.

1224
01:07:49.94 --> 01:07:53.94
One of the problems that's always hampered the grill is getting the word out.

1225
01:07:53.94 --> 01:07:57.94
In the days of older was done by messengers which today is an hours.

1226
01:07:57.94 --> 01:08:00.94
Today a general has very sharp communications.

1227
01:08:00.94 --> 01:08:05.94
Out in Somalia, General Adi had little portable radios to talk to his soldiers,

1228
01:08:05.94 --> 01:08:07.94
very low frequency.

1229
01:08:07.94 --> 01:08:11.94
The American CIA's intercept devices are all high frequency.

1230
01:08:11.94 --> 01:08:13.94
They couldn't listen to what the man was saying.

1231
01:08:13.94 --> 01:08:15.94
They didn't learn a thing.

1232
01:08:18.94 --> 01:08:26.94
Question, how frightened was the average American conscript faced with all these obstacles and the skill of the enemy?

1233
01:08:26.94 --> 01:08:31.94
Hackworth, the average American soldier going into battle in Vietnam,

1234
01:08:31.94 --> 01:08:36.94
carried a whole pack full of fear, mainly because he wasn't trained properly back in the state.

1235
01:08:36.94 --> 01:08:39.94
The training base was just off.

1236
01:08:39.94 --> 01:08:43.94
They were preparing for World War II, not for insurgency warfare,

1237
01:08:43.94 --> 01:08:47.94
so the lad received 16 weeks of training was flung in a Vietnam,

1238
01:08:47.94 --> 01:08:51.94
generally in a unit that was never kept together.

1239
01:08:51.94 --> 01:08:55.94
But it was always filled up by the individual replacement system.

1240
01:08:55.94 --> 01:09:00.94
As a result, there was no real strong cohesion, no teamwork in the unit.

1241
01:09:00.94 --> 01:09:05.94
And this is something that SLA Marshall talked about in Men Against Fire.

1242
01:09:05.94 --> 01:09:08.94
The soldier was like an orphan thrown into a family,

1243
01:09:08.94 --> 01:09:11.94
but a family that was not solidly put together.

1244
01:09:11.94 --> 01:09:16.94
As a result, his fear level would be high because of the uncertainty of what he was going into.

1245
01:09:16.94 --> 01:09:20.94
The typical kid who went to Vietnam was black.

1246
01:09:20.94 --> 01:09:23.94
21% of all soldiers were black,

1247
01:09:23.94 --> 01:09:28.94
and the Hispanics and the whites were from the other side of the railroad tracks.

1248
01:09:28.94 --> 01:09:32.94
If you went to a good university, like Brown University or something,

1249
01:09:32.94 --> 01:09:36.94
you didn't find yourself carrying an M16 rifle in Vietnam.

1250
01:09:36.94 --> 01:09:39.94
You did a Clinton. You got out of the war.

1251
01:09:39.94 --> 01:09:44.94
It was very unfair. The poor, working classes were the ones that carried out the war effort.

1252
01:09:44.94 --> 01:09:49.94
But they were made of tough stuff because their whole life required tough stuff.

1253
01:09:49.94 --> 01:09:52.94
Once they were provided with the leadership,

1254
01:09:52.94 --> 01:09:57.94
the proper leadership, that raw material did a hell of a job.

1255
01:09:57.94 --> 01:10:02.94
But it didn't make the fear go away.

1256
01:10:02.94 --> 01:10:06.94
When you're playing in that kind of a lethal super bowl,

1257
01:10:06.94 --> 01:10:11.94
the possibility of dying and coming home in a rubber bag is always lingering in the back of your head.

1258
01:10:11.94 --> 01:10:14.94
Regardless of how courageous you are,

1259
01:10:14.94 --> 01:10:16.94
you will still have fear.

1260
01:10:16.94 --> 01:10:20.94
But if you have competent leadership that you have confidence in,

1261
01:10:20.94 --> 01:10:23.94
and if you're well trained, you can get the job done.

1262
01:10:23.94 --> 01:10:28.94
It's my theory that the better trained you are, the more natural courage you have,

1263
01:10:28.94 --> 01:10:32.94
because you have a belief in yourself.

1264
01:10:36.94 --> 01:10:39.94
That's all important stuff.

1265
01:10:39.94 --> 01:10:43.94
The better trained you are, the more natural courage you have.

1266
01:10:43.94 --> 01:10:46.94
Keep that in mind.

1267
01:10:46.94 --> 01:10:51.94
Also, the raw material just give me some good leadership

1268
01:10:51.94 --> 01:10:55.94
and it will make something happen.

1269
01:10:55.94 --> 01:10:59.94
Continuing, our soldiers weren't well trained,

1270
01:10:59.94 --> 01:11:02.94
and in the main they weren't well led.

1271
01:11:02.94 --> 01:11:04.94
But the longer the soldiers stayed there,

1272
01:11:04.94 --> 01:11:07.94
the more experienced he became, and the more confident he became.

1273
01:11:07.94 --> 01:11:09.94
The uncertainty was dispelled.

1274
01:11:09.94 --> 01:11:11.94
He knew what to expect.

1275
01:11:11.94 --> 01:11:14.94
But the fear would never go away.

1276
01:11:14.94 --> 01:11:19.94
You know, you can never go near a battlefield without having those butterflies in your stomach.

1277
01:11:19.94 --> 01:11:22.94
Question, what frightened your soldiers most?

1278
01:11:22.94 --> 01:11:25.94
Hackworth, I think it was the uncertainty.

1279
01:11:25.94 --> 01:11:29.94
Once they got into a unit and knew they were well led,

1280
01:11:29.94 --> 01:11:32.94
knew that their commander loved them and cared for them,

1281
01:11:32.94 --> 01:11:36.94
and would not throw them into harm's way unless absolutely necessary.

1282
01:11:36.94 --> 01:11:42.94
Their main fear was just that uncertainty that came from the minds and booby traps.

1283
01:11:42.94 --> 01:11:44.94
And it's a psychological thing.

1284
01:11:44.94 --> 01:11:47.94
I've walked down trails, and I've said to myself,

1285
01:11:47.94 --> 01:11:49.94
my self-asniper has me in his sights.

1286
01:11:49.94 --> 01:11:52.94
You play those mind games with yourself.

1287
01:11:52.94 --> 01:11:54.94
I've had that kind of experience where I saw a guy,

1288
01:11:54.94 --> 01:11:56.94
where I saw a guy looking through his rifle,

1289
01:11:56.94 --> 01:12:00.94
looking at me perfectly at what we call a six o'clock sight picture,

1290
01:12:00.94 --> 01:12:04.94
and he's going to squeeze and you spot yourself going down.

1291
01:12:04.94 --> 01:12:09.94
Good leadership dispells all those kinds of mind games.

1292
01:12:09.94 --> 01:12:16.94
Question, there are all these images of American soldiers walking around,

1293
01:12:16.94 --> 01:12:19.94
smoking pot, beads around their neck, singing rock songs,

1294
01:12:19.94 --> 01:12:22.94
clearly the morale of the American troops broke down.

1295
01:12:22.94 --> 01:12:26.94
Hackworth, the morale of the American army disintegrated

1296
01:12:26.94 --> 01:12:29.94
the longer the war went on.

1297
01:12:29.94 --> 01:12:32.94
We went there with a professional army that was well led

1298
01:12:32.94 --> 01:12:36.94
by very fine combat leaders, most of whom were World War II

1299
01:12:36.94 --> 01:12:38.94
or Korea experienced.

1300
01:12:38.94 --> 01:12:41.94
I'm talking about senior NCOs and officers.

1301
01:12:41.94 --> 01:12:44.94
They had a lot of battle experience or high quality people,

1302
01:12:44.94 --> 01:12:47.94
and they were badly used from the beginning.

1303
01:12:47.94 --> 01:12:49.94
They were traded out.

1304
01:12:49.94 --> 01:12:53.94
So we lost the non-commissioned officer corps almost straight away

1305
01:12:53.94 --> 01:12:56.94
within the first 18 months of the war.

1306
01:12:56.94 --> 01:12:59.94
After that, there was no unit cohesion.

1307
01:12:59.94 --> 01:13:02.94
Every 365 days you had a new unit.

1308
01:13:02.94 --> 01:13:05.94
You had no institutional memory.

1309
01:13:05.94 --> 01:13:09.94
I know this is my team of obvious, but you got to keep people together.

1310
01:13:09.94 --> 01:13:12.94
When you get a good team, you got to keep them together.

1311
01:13:12.94 --> 01:13:15.94
No one remembered what happened last month.

1312
01:13:15.94 --> 01:13:19.94
And they kept repeating the same mistakes again and again and again.

1313
01:13:19.94 --> 01:13:21.94
The Americans were in Vietnam for eight years,

1314
01:13:21.94 --> 01:13:24.94
and there were no leaders at the top willing to raise Hell

1315
01:13:24.94 --> 01:13:26.94
and demand that the training be hard,

1316
01:13:26.94 --> 01:13:28.94
and demand that the standards be high.

1317
01:13:28.94 --> 01:13:32.94
No one wanted to shake things up in a very, very unpopular war.

1318
01:13:32.94 --> 01:13:36.94
Now the finest thing you can do for any young soldier is being

1319
01:13:36.94 --> 01:13:43.94
mean as hell with him, and whack him in the head when he doesn't do something

1320
01:13:43.94 --> 01:13:45.94
correctly.

1321
01:13:45.94 --> 01:13:49.94
Make certain that he knows his job and knows how to do it right,

1322
01:13:49.94 --> 01:13:52.94
because if he does it right, he'll do it right on the battlefield.

1323
01:13:52.94 --> 01:13:56.94
But the whole training and leading leadership system,

1324
01:13:56.94 --> 01:14:00.94
we're asking, how can we resolve this disintegrating morale problem?

1325
01:14:00.94 --> 01:14:03.94
We can resolve it by getting them to the right.

1326
01:14:03.94 --> 01:14:06.94
We're all problem. We can resolve it by getting them

1327
01:14:06.94 --> 01:14:12.94
or an R delivering cold beer and coke and ice cream at night and hot food.

1328
01:14:12.94 --> 01:14:15.94
This is what the general's mentality was,

1329
01:14:15.94 --> 01:14:19.94
instead of kicking them in the ass and making them do things right,

1330
01:14:19.94 --> 01:14:23.94
screw on their steel pot, carry their weapon and clean up their ammo,

1331
01:14:23.94 --> 01:14:26.94
get rid of their love beads and not smoke dope.

1332
01:14:26.94 --> 01:14:29.94
When I took over my battalion in a Delta,

1333
01:14:29.94 --> 01:14:33.94
I was grass all over the place. Before I'd go out with my battalion,

1334
01:14:33.94 --> 01:14:37.94
I'd shake everybody down. I'd boot people in the butt who even smoked cigarettes

1335
01:14:37.94 --> 01:14:39.94
because you could smell tobacco in my all-away.

1336
01:14:39.94 --> 01:14:42.94
You could see the light from a cigarette a couple miles away.

1337
01:14:42.94 --> 01:14:46.94
In my unit, you didn't smoke anything and you certainly didn't smoke grass.

1338
01:14:46.94 --> 01:14:49.94
It was just a question of discipline.

1339
01:14:49.94 --> 01:14:53.94
If you had good leadership and provided discipline,

1340
01:14:53.94 --> 01:14:59.94
you could design not to harass but to keep people alive, the soldiers would react.

1341
01:14:59.94 --> 01:15:02.94
So, critical distinction there.

1342
01:15:02.94 --> 01:15:06.94
Not talking about discipline, just design to harass people

1343
01:15:06.94 --> 01:15:08.94
and do things for no good reason,

1344
01:15:08.94 --> 01:15:11.94
but discipline that's actually there to keep people alive.

1345
01:15:11.94 --> 01:15:14.94
Continuing.

1346
01:15:14.94 --> 01:15:18.94
If they didn't have that, they would react the other way.

1347
01:15:18.94 --> 01:15:22.94
This saw between 1965 and 1973 when the last US forces went out

1348
01:15:22.94 --> 01:15:24.94
was a total disintegration.

1349
01:15:24.94 --> 01:15:27.94
It was an organization that didn't have proper boundaries

1350
01:15:27.94 --> 01:15:31.94
and didn't have people insisting on those boundaries.

1351
01:15:31.94 --> 01:15:35.94
They were an army of hippies and they didn't have discipline.

1352
01:15:35.94 --> 01:15:37.94
Had the war continued for a few more years,

1353
01:15:37.94 --> 01:15:43.94
we were seeing at the end by 1973 units refusing to fight.

1354
01:15:43.94 --> 01:15:46.94
Well, we'd have seen a whole army that refused to fight

1355
01:15:46.94 --> 01:15:50.94
because it was a most unpopular war and soldiers were saying,

1356
01:15:50.94 --> 01:15:52.94
what am I doing here?

1357
01:15:52.94 --> 01:15:55.94
My politicians want me out, my family wants me out,

1358
01:15:55.94 --> 01:15:57.94
and there's no purpose in being here.

1359
01:15:57.94 --> 01:16:00.94
This does not affect my country's security.

1360
01:16:00.94 --> 01:16:03.94
All I am is upon is stupid war.

1361
01:16:03.94 --> 01:16:08.94
They were an army of hippies and didn't have discipline.

1362
01:16:08.94 --> 01:16:11.94
Had the war continued for a few more years,

1363
01:16:11.94 --> 01:16:17.94
we were seeing at the end of 1973 units refusing to fight.

1364
01:16:17.94 --> 01:16:22.94
Well, we'd seen a whole army that refused to fight

1365
01:16:22.94 --> 01:16:24.94
because it was a most unpopular war

1366
01:16:24.94 --> 01:16:27.94
and the soldiers were saying, what am I doing here?

1367
01:16:27.94 --> 01:16:30.94
My politicians want me out, my family wants me out

1368
01:16:30.94 --> 01:16:32.94
and there's no purpose in being here.

1369
01:16:32.94 --> 01:16:34.94
This does not affect my country's security.

1370
01:16:34.94 --> 01:16:41.94
All I am is upon in a stupid war.

1371
01:16:41.94 --> 01:16:45.94
First of all, obviously we're not talking about every soldier,

1372
01:16:45.94 --> 01:16:47.94
every military, every service member, and Vietnam.

1373
01:16:47.94 --> 01:16:50.94
That was acting that way.

1374
01:16:50.94 --> 01:16:53.94
Clearly, there was people still doing heroic things

1375
01:16:53.94 --> 01:16:55.94
and serving to the best of their ability.

1376
01:16:55.94 --> 01:16:58.94
But he's making a broad general statement.

1377
01:16:58.94 --> 01:17:03.94
That if we saw in 1973 some units that were saying,

1378
01:17:03.94 --> 01:17:07.94
hey, we don't want to fight, then if you would have continued down that trajectory,

1379
01:17:07.94 --> 01:17:09.94
you eventually have been saying, hey, wait a second.

1380
01:17:09.94 --> 01:17:12.94
There'd be a lot more units that would be saying that.

1381
01:17:12.94 --> 01:17:20.94
Next, how did your soldiers, particularly your fresh recruits,

1382
01:17:20.94 --> 01:17:23.94
cope with not knowing who the enemy was?

1383
01:17:23.94 --> 01:17:25.94
Hackworth.

1384
01:17:25.94 --> 01:17:27.94
When a soldier would arrive in Vietnam,

1385
01:17:27.94 --> 01:17:30.94
badly trained from the USA, not prepared for the war.

1386
01:17:30.94 --> 01:17:34.94
My procedure was that each unit from their own training program

1387
01:17:34.94 --> 01:17:36.94
at division level.

1388
01:17:36.94 --> 01:17:39.94
The young recruit would go through this training up to two weeks

1389
01:17:39.94 --> 01:17:42.94
in his particular area of operations.

1390
01:17:42.94 --> 01:17:45.94
For example, looking after your feet in the may-con delta,

1391
01:17:45.94 --> 01:17:48.94
keeping your ammo dry, and things of this nature.

1392
01:17:48.94 --> 01:17:51.94
After they finished that division level training,

1393
01:17:51.94 --> 01:17:53.94
they would come to a unit.

1394
01:17:53.94 --> 01:17:55.94
Normally, I would talk to my soldiers,

1395
01:17:55.94 --> 01:17:58.94
welcome them to the unit, assign them to a rifle company.

1396
01:17:58.94 --> 01:18:02.94
My standard operating procedure was to assign a young recruit to an old soldier

1397
01:18:02.94 --> 01:18:04.94
in the same foxhole.

1398
01:18:04.94 --> 01:18:06.94
That soldier would be his buddy.

1399
01:18:06.94 --> 01:18:10.94
A veteran would get a green recruit or a fresh meat as they called them,

1400
01:18:10.94 --> 01:18:15.94
and he would take that new guy and pass his knowledge to him.

1401
01:18:15.94 --> 01:18:19.94
Question, were your soldiers ever reluctant to fight?

1402
01:18:19.94 --> 01:18:22.94
Hackworth, I had the ability to motivate people.

1403
01:18:22.94 --> 01:18:25.94
Even though a guy might be a pacifist,

1404
01:18:25.94 --> 01:18:28.94
in a few days, he was hunting for Charlie.

1405
01:18:28.94 --> 01:18:33.94
I never had a problem in terms of getting soldiers to fight.

1406
01:18:33.94 --> 01:18:36.94
Question, were you ever frightened?

1407
01:18:36.94 --> 01:18:40.94
Can you remember a moment when you were frightened?

1408
01:18:40.94 --> 01:18:45.94
Hackworth, I spent eight years on battlefields as a soldier,

1409
01:18:45.94 --> 01:18:51.94
and I'm sure that there aren't very many minutes of those eight years that I wasn't frightened.

1410
01:18:51.94 --> 01:18:54.94
It's something that lives in your stomach.

1411
01:18:54.94 --> 01:18:56.94
It's just churning all the time.

1412
01:18:56.94 --> 01:18:59.94
As the bullets start snapping in the intensity of combat increases,

1413
01:18:59.94 --> 01:19:01.94
that churning increases.

1414
01:19:01.94 --> 01:19:03.94
But it's always there.

1415
01:19:03.94 --> 01:19:06.94
As long as you're in a dangerous situation,

1416
01:19:06.94 --> 01:19:11.94
you've got it, and you're carrying it with you on your back.

1417
01:19:11.94 --> 01:19:18.94
Question, did your soldiers have any compunction about shooting civilians on the chance that they were via Kong?

1418
01:19:18.94 --> 01:19:22.94
Hackworth, I think the average American soldier perceived the enemy as,

1419
01:19:22.94 --> 01:19:25.94
but for the grace of God, there go I,

1420
01:19:25.94 --> 01:19:30.94
and they were reluctant to shoot somebody unless they knew they were of the enemy.

1421
01:19:30.94 --> 01:19:33.94
But if the guy were coming at him at night,

1422
01:19:33.94 --> 01:19:38.94
if the guy were walking in an area he shouldn't be in and had weapons or something like that,

1423
01:19:38.94 --> 01:19:42.94
the way I trained my soldiers was to react automatically.

1424
01:19:42.94 --> 01:19:46.94
Don't get the thinking process going.

1425
01:19:46.94 --> 01:19:48.94
When you see a right cross-combat you,

1426
01:19:48.94 --> 01:19:52.94
block it with your left hand and go with the right hook.

1427
01:19:52.94 --> 01:19:56.94
I never had problems with soldiers being reluctant to fight.

1428
01:19:56.94 --> 01:20:03.94
Of course, this is different than the SLA martial report of people not wanting to fight.

1429
01:20:03.94 --> 01:20:07.94
And it's also, you know,

1430
01:20:07.94 --> 01:20:10.94
I say this sometimes people freak out about it.

1431
01:20:10.94 --> 01:20:13.94
When I say don't think, right, it's not thinking.

1432
01:20:13.94 --> 01:20:15.94
Hey, your alarm clock goes off the morning.

1433
01:20:15.94 --> 01:20:17.94
Don't think you just get up and you do what you're supposed to do.

1434
01:20:17.94 --> 01:20:19.94
Oh, you're supposed to work out.

1435
01:20:19.94 --> 01:20:20.94
Don't think about it.

1436
01:20:20.94 --> 01:20:21.94
Just go do it.

1437
01:20:21.94 --> 01:20:25.94
And that's what he's saying for a more important situation.

1438
01:20:25.94 --> 01:20:26.94
Oh, there's an enemy threat.

1439
01:20:26.94 --> 01:20:28.94
Don't think about it.

1440
01:20:28.94 --> 01:20:30.94
Do what you're supposed to do.

1441
01:20:35.94 --> 01:20:38.94
Would it surprise you to know that the chief concierge

1442
01:20:38.94 --> 01:20:41.94
at the continental hotel, side-gons, top hotel,

1443
01:20:41.94 --> 01:20:44.94
was in fact working for the Vietcong.

1444
01:20:44.94 --> 01:20:46.94
Hackworth, it wouldn't surprise me.

1445
01:20:46.94 --> 01:20:51.94
At TET of 68, the Secretary of the to the commanding general of the US forces in Vietnam,

1446
01:20:51.94 --> 01:20:55.94
General Westmoreland was found holding an AK47.

1447
01:20:55.94 --> 01:20:58.94
With the whole Vietnames apparatus,

1448
01:20:58.94 --> 01:21:00.94
I never once trusted a Vietnames.

1449
01:21:00.94 --> 01:21:02.94
I never trusted a Vietnames general.

1450
01:21:02.94 --> 01:21:05.94
I never allowed a Vietnames inside my camp, my firebase.

1451
01:21:05.94 --> 01:21:07.94
If I were going to meet a Vietnames kernel,

1452
01:21:07.94 --> 01:21:11.94
I would meet him outside my firebase because I didn't trust him.

1453
01:21:11.94 --> 01:21:14.94
I assumed everybody was Vietcong.

1454
01:21:14.94 --> 01:21:18.94
Question, and the use of the people you were meant to be fighting for.

1455
01:21:18.94 --> 01:21:21.94
Hackworth, that's right, and that was my attitude.

1456
01:21:21.94 --> 01:21:27.94
The soldiers from the 9th Division hated the South Vietnamese soldiers more than they did the Vietcong.

1457
01:21:27.94 --> 01:21:32.94
So what he's saying right there is, I'm going to read that again.

1458
01:21:32.94 --> 01:21:37.94
My soldiers from the 9th Division hated the South Vietnamese soldiers more than they did the Vietcong.

1459
01:21:37.94 --> 01:21:40.94
That's a horrible situation.

1460
01:21:40.94 --> 01:21:44.94
They saw them coming and going out.

1461
01:21:44.94 --> 01:21:48.94
They saw them going out on operations and not beating the enemy, but avoiding the enemy.

1462
01:21:48.94 --> 01:21:51.94
They called it search and avoid were supposed to be search and destroy.

1463
01:21:51.94 --> 01:21:56.94
My Bataen could go all the way through the same area and come back bloodied and battered.

1464
01:21:56.94 --> 01:21:58.94
That really got to my guys.

1465
01:21:58.94 --> 01:22:00.94
I was walking the perimeter one night.

1466
01:22:00.94 --> 01:22:03.94
I used the British system of stand two in the evening,

1467
01:22:03.94 --> 01:22:07.94
where everybody was at their post with a weapon ready to go,

1468
01:22:07.94 --> 01:22:09.94
just as the sun was going down.

1469
01:22:09.94 --> 01:22:13.94
One of my sniper said, sir, how's the body count today?

1470
01:22:13.94 --> 01:22:15.94
And I said, not so good.

1471
01:22:15.94 --> 01:22:18.94
We only had a 8 or 9 for the day for the Bataen.

1472
01:22:18.94 --> 01:22:22.94
And he said, well, I'll get you two more before I could stop him.

1473
01:22:22.94 --> 01:22:24.94
He took out a sniper rifle.

1474
01:22:24.94 --> 01:22:27.94
I looked down at the end of the weapon to see where it was pointed.

1475
01:22:27.94 --> 01:22:33.94
And it was pointed at two South Vietnamese soldiers guarding a bridge about 40 meters from my perimeter.

1476
01:22:33.94 --> 01:22:38.94
I knocked the weapon up before he had a chance to scream, squeeze off around.

1477
01:22:38.94 --> 01:22:41.94
This was the attitude of a lot of soldiers.

1478
01:22:41.94 --> 01:22:46.94
They didn't like the South Vietnamese because they didn't pull their weight.

1479
01:22:46.94 --> 01:22:52.94
Question, why did massacre as a current Vietnam hack worth?

1480
01:22:52.94 --> 01:22:56.94
Well, the big massacre was me lie.

1481
01:22:56.94 --> 01:23:01.94
Lieutenant William Carley and Captain Medina were the principal characters involved in that act.

1482
01:23:01.94 --> 01:23:03.94
Why did they have that occur?

1483
01:23:03.94 --> 01:23:05.94
It occurred for a number of reasons.

1484
01:23:05.94 --> 01:23:07.94
The soldiers were frustrated.

1485
01:23:07.94 --> 01:23:11.94
They were mainly frustrated because of mines and booby traps,

1486
01:23:11.94 --> 01:23:13.94
and because they could never find the enemy.

1487
01:23:13.94 --> 01:23:18.94
They were just tripping through mine fields and seeing their mates blown away,

1488
01:23:18.94 --> 01:23:22.94
never grabbing hold of the enemy and getting into a real fight.

1489
01:23:22.94 --> 01:23:24.94
Then there's a lot of people in a village,

1490
01:23:24.94 --> 01:23:30.94
and then insanity takes over, and they just start blowing human beings away.

1491
01:23:30.94 --> 01:23:34.94
It's also about bad leadership.

1492
01:23:34.94 --> 01:23:37.94
Lieutenant Carley had gone through Officer Canada School.

1493
01:23:37.94 --> 01:23:39.94
He had gone through three separate courses,

1494
01:23:39.94 --> 01:23:42.94
was found wanting and leadership in two of them,

1495
01:23:42.94 --> 01:23:46.94
and had been recycled instead of being booted out.

1496
01:23:46.94 --> 01:23:52.94
The military was into a numbers game and didn't want to have a high-attrition rate for their officers.

1497
01:23:52.94 --> 01:23:56.94
They kept recycling someone until they graduated.

1498
01:23:56.94 --> 01:24:02.94
So here's a guy who never should have been trusted more than an Army PFC ends up a lieutenant.

1499
01:24:02.94 --> 01:24:08.94
He's with a platoon of soldiers who are extremely frustrated because of mines and booby traps,

1500
01:24:08.94 --> 01:24:15.94
and he doesn't have the leadership ability to control them to stop that fire.

1501
01:24:15.94 --> 01:24:19.94
I think massacres occur when you don't have strong leadership,

1502
01:24:19.94 --> 01:24:25.94
when you don't have soldiers who are extremely well trained and well disciplined and well controlled by their leaders.

1503
01:24:25.94 --> 01:24:27.94
That's what happened.

1504
01:24:27.94 --> 01:24:31.94
All those components fell apart.

1505
01:24:31.94 --> 01:24:39.94
And I think the book that we covered on the Meal Eye Massacre actually gave even better details.

1506
01:24:39.94 --> 01:24:42.94
I mean, obviously it gave better details because it's a full book,

1507
01:24:42.94 --> 01:24:46.94
but I really was one of the key things I remember.

1508
01:24:46.94 --> 01:24:49.94
I remember how the intelligence escalated.

1509
01:24:49.94 --> 01:24:50.94
It escalated.

1510
01:24:50.94 --> 01:24:52.94
And I'll tell you something else.

1511
01:24:52.94 --> 01:24:58.94
He's saying that, you know, that Lieutenant Carley couldn't stop them.

1512
01:24:58.94 --> 01:25:00.94
Lieutenant Carley led that massacre.

1513
01:25:00.94 --> 01:25:01.94
He led the massacre.

1514
01:25:01.94 --> 01:25:04.94
Wasn't him saying, oh, I can't control the guy.

1515
01:25:04.94 --> 01:25:06.94
He was actually doing the massacre.

1516
01:25:06.94 --> 01:25:09.94
And they were, they were actually following.

1517
01:25:09.94 --> 01:25:13.94
And that wraps up that wraps up the interview.

1518
01:25:13.94 --> 01:25:14.94
It was kind of a abrupt ending.

1519
01:25:14.94 --> 01:25:16.94
I don't know why it's so abrupt.

1520
01:25:16.94 --> 01:25:18.94
I looked around and see if there was anything else missing.

1521
01:25:18.94 --> 01:25:21.94
But that's how the interview ends.

1522
01:25:21.94 --> 01:25:23.94
But I wanted to go to it from there.

1523
01:25:23.94 --> 01:25:26.94
I wanted to just grab a couple sections out of the Vietnam primer.

1524
01:25:26.94 --> 01:25:29.94
Again, this is the book that that hack worth wrote.

1525
01:25:29.94 --> 01:25:33.94
Hack worth wrote with SLA Marshall when they got back.

1526
01:25:33.94 --> 01:25:36.94
For when they got back from this torn Vietnam,

1527
01:25:36.94 --> 01:25:37.94
there was a few months long.

1528
01:25:37.94 --> 01:25:39.94
And they went and talked debriefed all kinds of people.

1529
01:25:39.94 --> 01:25:43.94
And again, there's all kinds of tactical level lessons in here.

1530
01:25:43.94 --> 01:25:47.94
I mean, like real tactical doubling security,

1531
01:25:47.94 --> 01:25:50.94
contending with a jungle security on the trail.

1532
01:25:50.94 --> 01:25:52.94
The company in movement field and intelligence.

1533
01:25:52.94 --> 01:25:54.94
I mean, there's the defensive perimeter.

1534
01:25:54.94 --> 01:25:57.94
It's just very, it's also a very short book.

1535
01:25:57.94 --> 01:25:59.94
And I mean, a hundred pages long.

1536
01:25:59.94 --> 01:26:01.94
And like I said, if you want to get this,

1537
01:26:01.94 --> 01:26:05.94
if you're in the military, you might be able to use this.

1538
01:26:05.94 --> 01:26:07.94
If you're leading up, if you're a platoon leader,

1539
01:26:07.94 --> 01:26:10.94
you probably get some decent lesson thrown down to this.

1540
01:26:10.94 --> 01:26:15.94
But this isn't one of those books that translates directly to business.

1541
01:26:15.94 --> 01:26:18.94
Because it's actually not, it's not about leadership.

1542
01:26:18.94 --> 01:26:25.94
It's about the tactics of an infantry platoon and infantry company.

1543
01:26:25.94 --> 01:26:32.94
So, but that being said, of course, there are some lessons.

1544
01:26:32.94 --> 01:26:36.94
And what's interesting to me is also, as I found these leadership lessons.

1545
01:26:36.94 --> 01:26:38.94
They're not just leadership lessons.

1546
01:26:38.94 --> 01:26:47.94
Beyond being leadership lessons, there's a lot of lessons here for you as a person,

1547
01:26:47.94 --> 01:26:49.94
for me as a person.

1548
01:26:49.94 --> 01:26:54.94
And you start taking the leadership lessons from Vietnam,

1549
01:26:54.94 --> 01:26:56.94
and applying them to yourself.

1550
01:26:56.94 --> 01:26:59.94
I think you could see a lot of crossover.

1551
01:26:59.94 --> 01:27:02.94
Starting from a leadership perspective, though, here we go.

1552
01:27:02.94 --> 01:27:04.94
Vietnam, primer.

1553
01:27:04.94 --> 01:27:06.94
Back to the book.

1554
01:27:06.94 --> 01:27:10.94
Armistakes in Vietnam are neither new nor startling.

1555
01:27:10.94 --> 01:27:13.94
They are not something we can blame on the mysteries of warfare.

1556
01:27:13.94 --> 01:27:18.94
They are the same problems that have been haunting small unit commander since before Gideon.

1557
01:27:18.94 --> 01:27:23.94
In peace or war, these errors spell the difference between professionalism

1558
01:27:23.94 --> 01:27:26.94
and mediocrity.

1559
01:27:26.94 --> 01:27:30.94
Many young leaders, enchanted by the Hollywood image of war,

1560
01:27:30.94 --> 01:27:34.94
approach combat with the good guy versus the bad guy attitude.

1561
01:27:34.94 --> 01:27:39.94
But there is no similarity between what John Wayne gets away with on the screen

1562
01:27:39.94 --> 01:27:43.94
and the hot hard facts of a firefight.

1563
01:27:43.94 --> 01:27:48.94
A small unit leader in combat cannot afford to have a film heroes

1564
01:27:48.94 --> 01:27:53.94
and a devil-make-air attitude toward training, discipline and basic soldiering.

1565
01:27:53.94 --> 01:28:01.94
In the recipe for battle victory, well-led and disciplined soldiers are the main ingredient.

1566
01:28:01.94 --> 01:28:07.94
Soldiers who have been conditioned through training to react by habit when confronted

1567
01:28:07.94 --> 01:28:10.94
with the searing realities of engagement.

1568
01:28:10.94 --> 01:28:15.94
The habits learned in training, good or bad are the same habits

1569
01:28:15.94 --> 01:28:18.94
that move the soldier in combat.

1570
01:28:18.94 --> 01:28:22.94
A leader then must ensure that each of his soldiers is well trained

1571
01:28:22.94 --> 01:28:27.94
and has developed good habits, habits so deeply ingrained through correct teaching

1572
01:28:27.94 --> 01:28:32.94
and intensive practice that even under the pressure of fear and sudden danger,

1573
01:28:32.94 --> 01:28:37.94
each soldier automatically will do the right thing.

1574
01:28:37.94 --> 01:28:39.94
Check.

1575
01:28:39.94 --> 01:28:54.94
Continuing, there is no magic formula or sweatless solution by which one can achieve this goal.

1576
01:28:54.94 --> 01:28:56.94
There's no hack.

1577
01:28:56.94 --> 01:29:01.94
Leaders may approach training for combat only with intense dedication,

1578
01:29:01.94 --> 01:29:08.94
accepting as gospel the timeless truth that better trained men live longer on the battlefield.

1579
01:29:08.94 --> 01:29:14.94
No military unit is ever completely trained.

1580
01:29:14.94 --> 01:29:19.94
There will always be a weak area that requires additional time and effort.

1581
01:29:19.94 --> 01:29:24.94
The wise commander uses all available time to train his unit.

1582
01:29:24.94 --> 01:29:27.94
He never says good enough.

1583
01:29:27.94 --> 01:29:31.94
Leaders must accept the old but absolute maximum,

1584
01:29:31.94 --> 01:29:36.94
the more sweat on the training field, the less blood on the battlefield.

1585
01:29:36.94 --> 01:29:43.94
Combat is too serious a business to permit easy excuse of even one mistake.

1586
01:29:43.94 --> 01:29:49.94
Never quit checking.

1587
01:29:49.94 --> 01:29:52.94
Check everything all the time.

1588
01:29:52.94 --> 01:29:57.94
Weapons for cleanliness, aid men for supplies, centuries for alertness

1589
01:29:57.94 --> 01:30:03.94
and the camp for field sanitation.

1590
01:30:03.94 --> 01:30:13.94
Another weakness among junior leaders is the inaccurate report of the estimate of the situation.

1591
01:30:13.94 --> 01:30:21.94
Estimates are many times either so greatly exaggerated or so watered down that they are not meaningful to the next higher commander

1592
01:30:21.94 --> 01:30:28.94
who must make critical decisions as to troop employment and allocation of combat power.

1593
01:30:28.94 --> 01:30:35.94
The confusion and noise of the battlefield are two reasons why faulty estimates are made.

1594
01:30:35.94 --> 01:30:40.94
Over emotionalism and the sense of the drama are others.

1595
01:30:40.94 --> 01:30:51.94
These factors coupled with the judgment of an impulsive commander who feels that he must say something on the radio even if it is wrong, are the crux of the problem.

1596
01:30:51.94 --> 01:31:04.94
Commanders must report the facts as they see them on the battlefield if they don't know the situation, they must just say that.

1597
01:31:04.94 --> 01:31:12.94
And again those are just a couple little lessons learned out of Vietnam primer.

1598
01:31:12.94 --> 01:31:25.94
And I think one of the things like I said, there's a lot of things that you can take from what Hackworth talks about and we talk about leadership.

1599
01:31:25.94 --> 01:31:28.94
And you can actually apply it to yourself.

1600
01:31:28.94 --> 01:31:32.94
You can apply it to your personal life and some of the things that you just said, think about some of these.

1601
01:31:32.94 --> 01:31:37.94
Armestakes are nothing new or startling.

1602
01:31:37.94 --> 01:31:40.94
Think about that.

1603
01:31:40.94 --> 01:31:47.94
Most of the time most of the time think about this most of the time when you make a mistake.

1604
01:31:47.94 --> 01:31:54.94
It's something that you already knew you actually know you're making the mistake when you're making it.

1605
01:31:54.94 --> 01:31:56.94
Here's another thing he says.

1606
01:31:56.94 --> 01:32:01.94
Errors spell the difference between professionalism and mediocrity.

1607
01:32:01.94 --> 01:32:03.94
It's the little things.

1608
01:32:03.94 --> 01:32:06.94
It's the little mistakes that you make.

1609
01:32:06.94 --> 01:32:14.94
Next thing he says, discipline soldiers are the main ingredient in victory.

1610
01:32:14.94 --> 01:32:19.94
We'll guess what the main ingredient in victory in your life is.

1611
01:32:19.94 --> 01:32:20.94
Discipline.

1612
01:32:20.94 --> 01:32:21.94
Yeah.

1613
01:32:21.94 --> 01:32:24.94
All day.

1614
01:32:24.94 --> 01:32:33.94
He says there's no magic formula or sweatless solution by which one can achieve their goals.

1615
01:32:33.94 --> 01:32:37.94
I think he just said there's no there is no shortcut. There is no hack.

1616
01:32:37.94 --> 01:32:39.94
There's no sweatless solution.

1617
01:32:39.94 --> 01:32:44.94
You're gonna have to work.

1618
01:32:44.94 --> 01:32:47.94
Then he says this no military unit is ever completely trained.

1619
01:32:47.94 --> 01:32:52.94
Guess what neither are you neither am I.

1620
01:32:52.94 --> 01:32:55.94
There is always weakness to work on always.

1621
01:32:55.94 --> 01:33:00.94
A lot of them.

1622
01:33:00.94 --> 01:33:03.94
He says this in Vietnam primer.

1623
01:33:03.94 --> 01:33:10.94
Combat is two series of business to permit easy excuse of even one mistake.

1624
01:33:10.94 --> 01:33:12.94
Now think about this.

1625
01:33:12.94 --> 01:33:13.94
Okay.

1626
01:33:13.94 --> 01:33:15.94
Combat's two series of business.

1627
01:33:15.94 --> 01:33:16.94
Why is that?

1628
01:33:16.94 --> 01:33:17.94
It's because you can die.

1629
01:33:17.94 --> 01:33:18.94
But guess what?

1630
01:33:18.94 --> 01:33:21.94
We're all gonna die.

1631
01:33:21.94 --> 01:33:22.94
We're all gonna die.

1632
01:33:22.94 --> 01:33:28.94
So why would we allow ourselves to make easy, easy excuses?

1633
01:33:28.94 --> 01:33:31.94
Why would you allow that?

1634
01:33:31.94 --> 01:33:33.94
Combat's life and death.

1635
01:33:33.94 --> 01:33:38.94
So is life.

1636
01:33:38.94 --> 01:33:41.94
So you shouldn't allow yourself these easy excuses.

1637
01:33:41.94 --> 01:33:49.94
And then the last section that he talks about that I read, it can absolutely be applied.

1638
01:33:49.94 --> 01:33:51.94
It can absolutely be applied.

1639
01:33:51.94 --> 01:33:57.94
He says another weakness common among junior leaders is the inaccurate reporting.

1640
01:33:57.94 --> 01:34:00.94
The inaccurate reporting of the estimate of the situation.

1641
01:34:00.94 --> 01:34:10.94
They are either so exaggerated or will so water down that they are not meaningful.

1642
01:34:10.94 --> 01:34:20.94
Now again if you apply this to yourself what you realize is that you have these junior leaders that they're lying to the chain of command.

1643
01:34:20.94 --> 01:34:25.94
I mean they're exaggerating or they're watering things down but they're basically lying to the chain of command.

1644
01:34:25.94 --> 01:34:26.94
Well how does that translate to us?

1645
01:34:26.94 --> 01:34:29.94
We lie to ourselves.

1646
01:34:29.94 --> 01:34:31.94
That's how it translates to us.

1647
01:34:31.94 --> 01:34:33.94
We lie to ourselves.

1648
01:34:33.94 --> 01:34:35.94
We don't tell ourselves the way things really are.

1649
01:34:35.94 --> 01:34:39.94
And when we do that then we can't fix our problems.

1650
01:34:39.94 --> 01:34:41.94
If we can't fix our problems we're not gonna improve.

1651
01:34:41.94 --> 01:34:46.94
So we have to be truthful to ourselves.

1652
01:34:46.94 --> 01:34:48.94
I have to be truthful to myself.

1653
01:34:48.94 --> 01:34:50.94
You have to be truthful to yourself.

1654
01:34:50.94 --> 01:34:54.94
You have to stop rationalizing, stop making excuses, stop telling yourself.

1655
01:34:54.94 --> 01:34:58.94
Little water down the assessments of where you're really at.

1656
01:34:58.94 --> 01:35:04.94
Tell yourself the truth.

1657
01:35:04.94 --> 01:35:08.94
So that you can get where you want to go.

1658
01:35:08.94 --> 01:35:09.94
You can be who you want to be.

1659
01:35:09.94 --> 01:35:13.94
You could be who you should be.

1660
01:35:13.94 --> 01:35:20.94
Who you should be when you do what you know you should do when you pay attention to the little things.

1661
01:35:20.94 --> 01:35:24.94
When you implement discipline.

1662
01:35:24.94 --> 01:35:28.94
True and unfrenching and unmitigated discipline in your life.

1663
01:35:28.94 --> 01:35:34.94
When you stop trying to find a sweatless solution.

1664
01:35:34.94 --> 01:35:36.94
When you look for weaknesses to work on.

1665
01:35:36.94 --> 01:35:40.94
When you allow no easy excuses.

1666
01:35:40.94 --> 01:35:46.94
And all that starts when you stop lying to yourself.

1667
01:35:46.94 --> 01:35:51.94
That's when you can become who you know you should be.

1668
01:35:51.94 --> 01:35:55.94
When you tell yourself the truth about where you are.

1669
01:35:55.94 --> 01:35:58.94
So you can make sure you are in the right place.

1670
01:35:58.94 --> 01:36:04.94
And if you're not in the right place then you can get yourself on the path to get there.

1671
01:36:04.94 --> 01:36:15.94
The path of discipline, the path of hard work and the path of truth.

1672
01:36:15.94 --> 01:36:27.94
And I think that's all I've got for tonight.

1673
01:36:27.94 --> 01:36:33.94
So echo Charles speaking of the path of truth.

1674
01:36:33.94 --> 01:36:43.94
What's open to any suggestions you may or may not have on how we can get on that path.

1675
01:36:43.94 --> 01:36:46.94
And then go ahead and stay on a path.

1676
01:36:46.94 --> 01:36:47.94
Yeah.

1677
01:36:47.94 --> 01:36:52.94
I feel like more and more of us are on the path.

1678
01:36:52.94 --> 01:36:53.94
That's what I feel like.

1679
01:36:53.94 --> 01:36:55.94
You know at the roll call.

1680
01:36:55.94 --> 01:36:57.94
At the roll call that we just got done.

1681
01:36:57.94 --> 01:37:03.94
Which was an event if you don't know for military first responders, law enforcement,

1682
01:37:03.94 --> 01:37:05.94
paramedics, firefighters.

1683
01:37:05.94 --> 01:37:09.94
There was a lot of people there that are straight up on the path.

1684
01:37:09.94 --> 01:37:13.94
Yeah.

1685
01:37:13.94 --> 01:37:17.94
And it's one of those deals where you know how like when you hear a certain story.

1686
01:37:17.94 --> 01:37:21.94
And then you're about someone and you're like, like, dang that's impressive.

1687
01:37:21.94 --> 01:37:22.94
And then you hear it again.

1688
01:37:22.94 --> 01:37:25.94
And again and then again and then you're like, okay, you know, I'm kind of used to it.

1689
01:37:25.94 --> 01:37:30.94
I don't feel like I've gotten used to this at all because everyone's story is kind of different.

1690
01:37:30.94 --> 01:37:34.94
You know, so it kind of exposes this element of like,

1691
01:37:34.94 --> 01:37:38.94
like just immense of individuality of a person.

1692
01:37:38.94 --> 01:37:40.94
You know, so it's kind of like, I don't know.

1693
01:37:40.94 --> 01:37:41.94
It's like, I don't know.

1694
01:37:41.94 --> 01:37:44.94
Maybe like your kids birthday or something that happens over and over again,

1695
01:37:44.94 --> 01:37:45.94
but never gets old.

1696
01:37:45.94 --> 01:37:47.94
You know, kind of that kind of situation.

1697
01:37:47.94 --> 01:37:52.94
There was a guy he was like, and he just told me this while we were listening to you guys.

1698
01:37:52.94 --> 01:37:53.94
Dude, dude, just to.

1699
01:37:53.94 --> 01:37:56.94
And he was just right in the middle of it, just kind of in my ear.

1700
01:37:56.94 --> 01:37:59.94
And he's like, dude, I lost 70 pounds.

1701
01:37:59.94 --> 01:38:00.94
Yeah.

1702
01:38:00.94 --> 01:38:02.94
I'm on the path.

1703
01:38:02.94 --> 01:38:03.94
Geez.

1704
01:38:03.94 --> 01:38:07.94
Guys were just guys and girls females.

1705
01:38:07.94 --> 01:38:10.94
Boys and girls men and women.

1706
01:38:10.94 --> 01:38:13.94
We're walking up to me and like showing me pictures.

1707
01:38:13.94 --> 01:38:16.94
Hey, this is what I looked like 13 months ago.

1708
01:38:16.94 --> 01:38:17.94
Me.

1709
01:38:17.94 --> 01:38:20.94
I've lost 38 pounds or whatever.

1710
01:38:20.94 --> 01:38:21.94
Awesome.

1711
01:38:21.94 --> 01:38:23.94
I got promoted.

1712
01:38:23.94 --> 01:38:24.94
Yeah.

1713
01:38:24.94 --> 01:38:26.94
It's awesome.

1714
01:38:26.94 --> 01:38:28.94
So yes, you are correct.

1715
01:38:28.94 --> 01:38:30.94
There's a lot of people on the path.

1716
01:38:30.94 --> 01:38:31.94
Kids, everything.

1717
01:38:31.94 --> 01:38:32.94
Kids, oh yeah.

1718
01:38:32.94 --> 01:38:33.94
Oh yeah.

1719
01:38:33.94 --> 01:38:35.94
People, I made little videos for kids.

1720
01:38:35.94 --> 01:38:38.94
I was looking at videos, kids, kids doing pull ups.

1721
01:38:38.94 --> 01:38:39.94
Kids doing jiu-jitsu.

1722
01:38:39.94 --> 01:38:41.94
The warrior kids.

1723
01:38:41.94 --> 01:38:43.94
Straight up on the path.

1724
01:38:43.94 --> 01:38:47.94
No one, the, no one, the getty's burger dress.

1725
01:38:47.94 --> 01:38:49.94
Hey, look at this kid.

1726
01:38:49.94 --> 01:38:50.94
Look at my son.

1727
01:38:50.94 --> 01:38:51.94
He knows he got his burger dress.

1728
01:38:51.94 --> 01:38:52.94
He's six.

1729
01:38:52.94 --> 01:38:55.94
No, look at my daughter.

1730
01:38:55.94 --> 01:38:57.94
That's six pull ups right there.

1731
01:38:57.94 --> 01:39:00.94
You know, you know how many should you could do last year?

1732
01:39:00.94 --> 01:39:01.94
Zero.

1733
01:39:01.94 --> 01:39:02.94
Yeah.

1734
01:39:02.94 --> 01:39:03.94
You see what I'm saying?

1735
01:39:03.94 --> 01:39:06.94
I'm just gonna go and grab a pat.

1736
01:39:06.94 --> 01:39:08.94
You think it's gonna get crowded around the path?

1737
01:39:08.94 --> 01:39:09.94
No.

1738
01:39:09.94 --> 01:39:10.94
It'll get wider.

1739
01:39:10.94 --> 01:39:11.94
Maybe the path gets wider.

1740
01:39:11.94 --> 01:39:12.94
It's wide.

1741
01:39:12.94 --> 01:39:13.94
Everyone's kind of on their own path.

1742
01:39:13.94 --> 01:39:15.94
But there's just a unified, yeah.

1743
01:39:15.94 --> 01:39:18.94
Oh, there's, there's common ground on the path.

1744
01:39:18.94 --> 01:39:19.94
Yeah, there's definitely a general.

1745
01:39:19.94 --> 01:39:22.94
You know, I mean, on a fundamental level, actually, there's, there's immense

1746
01:39:22.94 --> 01:39:23.94
commonality.

1747
01:39:23.94 --> 01:39:27.94
You know, but the path is big enough to maintain.

1748
01:39:27.94 --> 01:39:30.94
There's not gonna be a traffic jam on the path.

1749
01:39:30.94 --> 01:39:31.94
No.

1750
01:39:31.94 --> 01:39:32.94
It's very, it's just a opposite.

1751
01:39:32.94 --> 01:39:33.94
Yeah.

1752
01:39:33.94 --> 01:39:35.94
The more people have a path, the faster it goes.

1753
01:39:35.94 --> 01:39:36.94
Yeah, more momentum.

1754
01:39:36.94 --> 01:39:37.94
Yeah.

1755
01:39:37.94 --> 01:39:38.94
Yeah.

1756
01:39:38.94 --> 01:39:39.94
So, all right.

1757
01:39:39.94 --> 01:39:41.94
Well, we're now, we're now, we're now, you could take leadership principles and

1758
01:39:41.94 --> 01:39:43.94
apply them to yourself.

1759
01:39:43.94 --> 01:39:44.94
Yeah.

1760
01:39:44.94 --> 01:39:44.94
Yeah.

1761
01:39:44.94 --> 01:39:46.94
So it's almost like don't lie to yourself.

1762
01:39:46.94 --> 01:39:47.94
Think about that.

1763
01:39:47.94 --> 01:39:48.94
Right.

1764
01:39:48.94 --> 01:39:49.94
Because you think about the little lies you tell yourself.

1765
01:39:49.94 --> 01:39:50.94
Oh, yeah.

1766
01:39:50.94 --> 01:39:51.94
They had a lie.

1767
01:39:51.94 --> 01:39:52.94
I was like this myself.

1768
01:39:52.94 --> 01:39:55.94
So long time ago, my mom was like overweight.

1769
01:39:55.94 --> 01:39:56.94
I didn't know.

1770
01:39:56.94 --> 01:39:58.94
I mean, I guess I knew that.

1771
01:39:58.94 --> 01:39:59.94
No, no, no, no, no.

1772
01:39:59.94 --> 01:40:00.94
When you're a little kid, you know, no.

1773
01:40:00.94 --> 01:40:01.94
You just need to know about that.

1774
01:40:01.94 --> 01:40:02.94
Yeah.

1775
01:40:02.94 --> 01:40:08.94
And then, so she got on the path back in the day and she lost a bunch of weight.

1776
01:40:08.94 --> 01:40:12.94
And my dad said, hey, you know, what am I going to get your mom for her birthday?

1777
01:40:12.94 --> 01:40:13.94
I was like, what?

1778
01:40:13.94 --> 01:40:15.94
He's like a mirror, a full size mirror.

1779
01:40:15.94 --> 01:40:16.94
Because she lost a bunch of weight.

1780
01:40:16.94 --> 01:40:17.94
Yeah.

1781
01:40:17.94 --> 01:40:18.94
It's good.

1782
01:40:18.94 --> 01:40:19.94
You know, whatever.

1783
01:40:19.94 --> 01:40:22.94
And I was like, cool, you know, that's something I don't stuff.

1784
01:40:22.94 --> 01:40:24.94
Whatever furniture was a furniture.

1785
01:40:24.94 --> 01:40:25.94
Good.

1786
01:40:25.94 --> 01:40:26.94
You know, whatever.

1787
01:40:26.94 --> 01:40:27.94
Good job that that whatever.

1788
01:40:27.94 --> 01:40:28.94
You know, kind of.

1789
01:40:28.94 --> 01:40:29.94
And then I kind of thought about it.

1790
01:40:29.94 --> 01:40:30.94
And I'm thinking about it more now.

1791
01:40:30.94 --> 01:40:33.94
It's like, man, you know what that, you know what that says?

1792
01:40:33.94 --> 01:40:38.94
That says that like, you know, she was like overweight and she was a sit from my dad to know that.

1793
01:40:38.94 --> 01:40:43.94
You know, and to take action like that means that he knew that she was in a way.

1794
01:40:43.94 --> 01:40:45.94
And when we're in another avoiding the mirror.

1795
01:40:45.94 --> 01:40:46.94
Yeah.

1796
01:40:46.94 --> 01:40:51.94
And well, I would say straight up avoiding it, but she just didn't want to see herself in the mirror.

1797
01:40:51.94 --> 01:40:52.94
Yeah.

1798
01:40:52.94 --> 01:40:53.94
You said the same thing I said.

1799
01:40:53.94 --> 01:40:57.94
I guess I said it in a little bit of different way, but she didn't want to see herself in the mirror.

1800
01:40:57.94 --> 01:40:58.94
Right.

1801
01:40:58.94 --> 01:41:02.94
If you have a, and you kind of think about it, sure you have a mirror in the bathroom and it's sort of it.

1802
01:41:02.94 --> 01:41:04.94
But like, I don't know where to where to do we have mirrors, right?

1803
01:41:04.94 --> 01:41:06.94
Like, I don't know in the bedroom or something.

1804
01:41:06.94 --> 01:41:07.94
You don't want girls to get ready.

1805
01:41:07.94 --> 01:41:08.94
I don't know.

1806
01:41:08.94 --> 01:41:09.94
I'm comparing it to my car.

1807
01:41:09.94 --> 01:41:10.94
I don't know.

1808
01:41:10.94 --> 01:41:10.94
I don't know.

1809
01:41:10.94 --> 01:41:13.94
I have like the mirror in the bathroom medicine cabinet.

1810
01:41:13.94 --> 01:41:14.94
Yeah.

1811
01:41:14.94 --> 01:41:14.94
Yeah.

1812
01:41:14.94 --> 01:41:20.94
I guess I guess my, you know what, you're right, because both my daughters, my older daughters had mirrors in their room.

1813
01:41:20.94 --> 01:41:21.94
Yeah.

1814
01:41:21.94 --> 01:41:22.94
I'll have to think.

1815
01:41:22.94 --> 01:41:23.94
Get ready.

1816
01:41:23.94 --> 01:41:24.94
Yeah.

1817
01:41:24.94 --> 01:41:24.94
Right.

1818
01:41:24.94 --> 01:41:25.94
Get ready.

1819
01:41:25.94 --> 01:41:26.94
Get that outfit.

1820
01:41:26.94 --> 01:41:27.94
I'm assuming.

1821
01:41:27.94 --> 01:41:29.94
You're looking over there.

1822
01:41:29.94 --> 01:41:30.94
But for a girl, I don't know.

1823
01:41:30.94 --> 01:41:33.94
Again, I'm just totally like thinking of my situation.

1824
01:41:33.94 --> 01:41:37.94
So, and yeah, so I kind of thinking back on like dang, we only had the mirror in the bathroom.

1825
01:41:37.94 --> 01:41:42.94
Anyway, so for that to be the case, for a mirror to be a good gift where your dad's going to tell you like,

1826
01:41:42.94 --> 01:41:45.94
How this has a good gift.

1827
01:41:45.94 --> 01:41:46.94
It kind of indicates that.

1828
01:41:46.94 --> 01:41:47.94
You don't like it.

1829
01:41:47.94 --> 01:41:48.94
It's like, oh yeah.

1830
01:41:48.94 --> 01:41:51.94
So anyway, the point is like, yeah, we do kind of like to ourselves.

1831
01:41:51.94 --> 01:41:53.94
Even if we don't think we're necessarily lying or something,

1832
01:41:53.94 --> 01:41:56.94
She's like, you don't want to admit certain things.

1833
01:41:56.94 --> 01:41:57.94
You see a mission.

1834
01:41:57.94 --> 01:41:58.94
Yeah.

1835
01:41:58.94 --> 01:41:58.94
Oh, yeah.

1836
01:41:58.94 --> 01:41:59.94
Oh, yeah.

1837
01:41:59.94 --> 01:42:00.94
I'm not even going to look at myself before.

1838
01:42:00.94 --> 01:42:01.94
Yeah.

1839
01:42:01.94 --> 01:42:02.94
I don't know what you just told subject to.

1840
01:42:02.94 --> 01:42:03.94
Yeah.

1841
01:42:03.94 --> 01:42:04.94
Yeah, yeah.

1842
01:42:04.94 --> 01:42:05.94
They're for us.

1843
01:42:05.94 --> 01:42:06.94
I like it.

1844
01:42:06.94 --> 01:42:07.94
Yeah.

1845
01:42:07.94 --> 01:42:08.94
Yeah.

1846
01:42:08.94 --> 01:42:10.94
Like if you don't do Jesus.

1847
01:42:10.94 --> 01:42:11.94
Yeah.

1848
01:42:11.94 --> 01:42:12.94
Like you don't do Jesus.

1849
01:42:12.94 --> 01:42:13.94
You don't want to.

1850
01:42:13.94 --> 01:42:14.94
If you don't do Jesus, you don't want to.

1851
01:42:14.94 --> 01:42:15.94
If you don't do Jesus, you want to.

1852
01:42:15.94 --> 01:42:16.94
If you don't do Jesus, you want to.

1853
01:42:16.94 --> 01:42:20.94
Let's say there's an a month or four days that you didn't do Jesus.

1854
01:42:20.94 --> 01:42:23.94
Three of those could have been legitimate days.

1855
01:42:23.94 --> 01:42:24.94
Yeah.

1856
01:42:24.94 --> 01:42:26.94
for whatever reason couldn't do G2.

1857
01:42:26.94 --> 01:42:29.74
One of those days might have been predicated on a lie

1858
01:42:29.74 --> 01:42:30.94
that you told yourself.

1859
01:42:30.94 --> 01:42:31.94
Right?

1860
01:42:31.94 --> 01:42:31.94
Right?

1861
01:42:31.94 --> 01:42:33.94
Like, I just don't have time today.

1862
01:42:33.94 --> 01:42:34.94
Yeah.

1863
01:42:34.94 --> 01:42:36.94
When what you really did was you extended some work.

1864
01:42:36.94 --> 01:42:37.94
Yeah.

1865
01:42:37.94 --> 01:42:38.94
An extra.

1866
01:42:38.94 --> 01:42:39.94
Because that's a weird time.

1867
01:42:39.94 --> 01:42:41.94
There's a weird time thing that happens with G2.

1868
01:42:41.94 --> 01:42:45.94
Like, hey, class starts at 4.30.

1869
01:42:45.94 --> 01:42:49.94
Or class starts at, like, hey, I'm going to roll at 5.30.

1870
01:42:49.94 --> 01:42:52.94
The guys are everyone's training at 6.

1871
01:42:52.94 --> 01:42:53.94
Right?

1872
01:42:53.94 --> 01:42:54.94
You know, no get 6.

1873
01:42:54.94 --> 01:43:02.94
Well, if I get caught up in something mysteriously and all of a sudden it's 6.04 at my house,

1874
01:43:02.94 --> 01:43:03.94
you know what?

1875
01:43:03.94 --> 01:43:09.94
I won't even get there until 6.20 or 6.15 by the time it gets changed.

1876
01:43:09.94 --> 01:43:11.94
You know, the guy's a probably done.

1877
01:43:11.94 --> 01:43:12.94
Yeah.

1878
01:43:12.94 --> 01:43:13.94
You just told yourself a bunch of lies.

1879
01:43:13.94 --> 01:43:18.94
Well, there are, I would say, because there's not, that's not nothing.

1880
01:43:18.94 --> 01:43:20.94
This is, and my house is called the G2 window.

1881
01:43:20.94 --> 01:43:23.94
So, okay. Like, because there is not like the gym.

1882
01:43:23.94 --> 01:43:25.94
Well, the like it, then I should have said this then.

1883
01:43:25.94 --> 01:43:26.94
The like came earlier.

1884
01:43:26.94 --> 01:43:29.94
The like came earlier, which was like, I should really get this done right now.

1885
01:43:29.94 --> 01:43:30.94
Yeah.

1886
01:43:30.94 --> 01:43:32.94
No, you could get that done when you get home later.

1887
01:43:32.94 --> 01:43:35.94
But you just, you just extended that window because you wanted to shut the G2 window

1888
01:43:35.94 --> 01:43:36.94
on yourself.

1889
01:43:36.94 --> 01:43:37.94
Right?

1890
01:43:37.94 --> 01:43:37.94
Yeah.

1891
01:43:37.94 --> 01:43:38.94
That's what happens.

1892
01:43:38.94 --> 01:43:41.94
And that window is like, that's a weird psychological area to be.

1893
01:43:41.94 --> 01:43:43.94
Because it's going to, I call it at home.

1894
01:43:43.94 --> 01:43:44.94
I call it the G2 window.

1895
01:43:44.94 --> 01:43:48.94
That's what it's kind of like, when my wife will be like, hey, can you, can you just go later?

1896
01:43:48.94 --> 01:43:49.94
I was like, no.

1897
01:43:49.94 --> 01:43:52.94
There's a window and it's super, super narrow.

1898
01:43:52.94 --> 01:43:56.94
Just like I said, when it's 604 and you're supposed to be there at six is that

1899
01:43:56.94 --> 01:43:57.94
because here's the factors.

1900
01:43:57.94 --> 01:44:01.94
One, everyone will be either finishing up or late in the rounds.

1901
01:44:01.94 --> 01:44:01.94
Yeah.

1902
01:44:01.94 --> 01:44:03.94
You'll get one roll.

1903
01:44:03.94 --> 01:44:07.94
So kind of the, the later you show up, the less training you're going to get.

1904
01:44:07.94 --> 01:44:09.94
So the less training you get, the less worth it.

1905
01:44:09.94 --> 01:44:12.94
It is to get dressed and get all your stuff to get in and go.

1906
01:44:12.94 --> 01:44:15.94
I'm not saying it's going to be not worth it.

1907
01:44:15.94 --> 01:44:17.94
But it becomes less and less worth it.

1908
01:44:17.94 --> 01:44:20.94
So there's that. And then there's like the social things.

1909
01:44:20.94 --> 01:44:22.94
Like, oh, you're the guy that shows up on the last round.

1910
01:44:22.94 --> 01:44:22.94
Yeah.

1911
01:44:22.94 --> 01:44:23.94
When it was tired, what are you doing?

1912
01:44:23.94 --> 01:44:25.94
You know, there's kind of like a stigma with that.

1913
01:44:25.94 --> 01:44:29.94
When somebody says that to me, I'm like, I just got done working.

1914
01:44:29.94 --> 01:44:31.94
I came here as quickly as I could.

1915
01:44:31.94 --> 01:44:31.94
Yeah.

1916
01:44:31.94 --> 01:44:32.94
And I'll tell you what.

1917
01:44:32.94 --> 01:44:35.94
I'll do 35 burpees right now.

1918
01:44:35.94 --> 01:44:35.94
Yeah.

1919
01:44:35.94 --> 01:44:37.94
And then we can train you.

1920
01:44:37.94 --> 01:44:38.94
Yeah.

1921
01:44:38.94 --> 01:44:41.94
And that's, of course, that's not because because that's not always the case.

1922
01:44:41.94 --> 01:44:43.94
I mean, with you, I can't really remember actually done that before.

1923
01:44:43.94 --> 01:44:44.94
But yeah.

1924
01:44:44.94 --> 01:44:45.94
That's just what I always,

1925
01:44:45.94 --> 01:44:48.94
that in just your answer there, kind of indicated like,

1926
01:44:48.94 --> 01:44:49.94
that's never happened to you.

1927
01:44:49.94 --> 01:44:50.94
How does it kind of think?

1928
01:44:50.94 --> 01:44:53.94
No, there's there's one, you know, big Eric.

1929
01:44:53.94 --> 01:44:53.94
Yeah.

1930
01:44:53.94 --> 01:44:53.94
Yeah.

1931
01:44:53.94 --> 01:44:55.94
Big Eric will be like, oh, you're showing up.

1932
01:44:55.94 --> 01:44:56.94
I'm like, bro.

1933
01:44:56.94 --> 01:44:59.94
He always did like one round.

1934
01:44:59.94 --> 01:45:00.94
Oh, no.

1935
01:45:00.94 --> 01:45:02.94
Come on.

1936
01:45:02.94 --> 01:45:03.94
Come on.

1937
01:45:03.94 --> 01:45:05.94
No, don't care.

1938
01:45:05.94 --> 01:45:10.94
I, another thing you'll say is if he's done anything else that day,

1939
01:45:10.94 --> 01:45:12.94
he'll tell you about it.

1940
01:45:12.94 --> 01:45:14.94
Like, like, a, hey, I went and ran stairs this morning.

1941
01:45:14.94 --> 01:45:15.94
I'm like, that's cool.

1942
01:45:15.94 --> 01:45:19.94
I squatted, did sprints went surfing and now I'm here to train.

1943
01:45:19.94 --> 01:45:20.94
What?

1944
01:45:20.94 --> 01:45:23.94
Even that's how it's.

1945
01:45:23.94 --> 01:45:24.94
Yeah.

1946
01:45:24.94 --> 01:45:25.94
Yeah.

1947
01:45:25.94 --> 01:45:27.94
But none of the last, did you swim into a thrill?

1948
01:45:27.94 --> 01:45:30.94
You know, because you'll, you know, let me just miss this.

1949
01:45:30.94 --> 01:45:32.94
And I don't mean this, you know, in a hostel way.

1950
01:45:32.94 --> 01:45:35.94
How come sometimes when the jiu-jitsu class starts,

1951
01:45:35.94 --> 01:45:37.94
let's say it, let's say we're going to train at 11.

1952
01:45:37.94 --> 01:45:41.94
How come sometimes you show up at like 11, 48?

1953
01:45:41.94 --> 01:45:44.94
That's, that's, that's a bit.

1954
01:45:44.94 --> 01:45:49.94
Maybe that went, sometimes it seems like your window is way just off alignment sometimes.

1955
01:45:49.94 --> 01:45:50.94
Seriously, I don't know.

1956
01:45:50.94 --> 01:45:52.94
Let's call it a Sunday, right?

1957
01:45:52.94 --> 01:45:55.94
We all know what time we start training, right?

1958
01:45:55.94 --> 01:45:58.94
And then sometimes you come rolling in and you want to talk about, you,

1959
01:45:58.94 --> 01:46:00.94
you like, hey, we know you're 15 minutes.

1960
01:46:00.94 --> 01:46:01.94
Say these guys, can we don't?

1961
01:46:01.94 --> 01:46:03.94
I'm, I'm an hour and a half.

1962
01:46:03.94 --> 01:46:04.94
Yeah, brown.

1963
01:46:04.94 --> 01:46:05.94
Walk it.

1964
01:46:05.94 --> 01:46:08.94
And you're rolling in like, bowing up to me.

1965
01:46:08.94 --> 01:46:11.94
Well, I'm going to blow up regarding, and of course, I'm not going to be saying, hey,

1966
01:46:11.94 --> 01:46:13.94
you know, you're showing up late and I'm kind of tired.

1967
01:46:13.94 --> 01:46:16.94
No, I'm going to say, okay, we're, you showing up. We'll do what we got to do.

1968
01:46:16.94 --> 01:46:17.94
Yeah, you know what it is, okay?

1969
01:46:17.94 --> 01:46:19.94
Because you know, I have no idea.

1970
01:46:19.94 --> 01:46:23.94
I have no idea how someone could be knowing that all of his training

1971
01:46:23.94 --> 01:46:28.94
partners that want to train with them are there at 10 o'clock or at 11 o'clock.

1972
01:46:28.94 --> 01:46:32.94
And that individual decides, hey, I'll just show up at 11, 48.

1973
01:46:32.94 --> 01:46:34.94
And call it good.

1974
01:46:34.94 --> 01:46:36.94
This is what happened.

1975
01:46:36.94 --> 01:46:40.94
On Sunday, the normal routine has always been I come at noon for Greg

1976
01:46:40.94 --> 01:46:41.94
Trains.

1977
01:46:41.94 --> 01:46:42.94
No, Guy.

1978
01:46:42.94 --> 01:46:43.94
Okay.

1979
01:46:43.94 --> 01:46:46.94
And they've been for two, three, four years.

1980
01:46:46.94 --> 01:46:47.94
You've shown up at that time.

1981
01:46:47.94 --> 01:46:49.94
See me in a ball of sweat.

1982
01:46:49.94 --> 01:46:51.94
12 rounds deep.

1983
01:46:51.94 --> 01:46:52.94
Yeah.

1984
01:46:52.94 --> 01:46:57.94
If you remember correctly, there are times that all come.

1985
01:46:57.94 --> 01:46:59.94
It'll be me and Andy just going around Robin.

1986
01:46:59.94 --> 01:47:01.94
There will be those times.

1987
01:47:01.94 --> 01:47:04.94
But you're looking at the amount of times that Andy and I have done that.

1988
01:47:04.94 --> 01:47:06.94
Very large number.

1989
01:47:06.94 --> 01:47:08.94
Yeah, I know, but here this is why though.

1990
01:47:08.94 --> 01:47:12.94
So it has to do with like my whole overall life scheduling.

1991
01:47:12.94 --> 01:47:14.94
So noon is the best time.

1992
01:47:14.94 --> 01:47:17.94
And I get trained with Greg and you're all this stuff.

1993
01:47:17.94 --> 01:47:19.94
And then you'll text me like the day before.

1994
01:47:19.94 --> 01:47:20.94
So you're in here.

1995
01:47:20.94 --> 01:47:21.94
We're going to freaking tent.

1996
01:47:21.94 --> 01:47:22.94
And I'm like, okay.

1997
01:47:22.94 --> 01:47:25.94
You got a hard, hard, crazy schedule.

1998
01:47:25.94 --> 01:47:27.94
I need to call your assistant.

1999
01:47:27.94 --> 01:47:29.94
You're going to put in your calendar.

2000
01:47:29.94 --> 01:47:31.94
Anyway, the day before.

2001
01:47:31.94 --> 01:47:33.94
Anyway, I'll text Andy and like,

2002
01:47:33.94 --> 01:47:35.94
I'm like, hey, I'm heading to the gym in 15 minutes.

2003
01:47:35.94 --> 01:47:36.94
He's like, I'm on my way.

2004
01:47:36.94 --> 01:47:37.94
Look, hey, look.

2005
01:47:37.94 --> 01:47:40.94
What Tuesday night, Thursday, Sunday morning.

2006
01:47:40.94 --> 01:47:43.94
Whatever, what if, okay, what if you and Andy had

2007
01:47:43.94 --> 01:47:48.94
planned to train at 10 and I text you, hey, let's train at 130.

2008
01:47:48.94 --> 01:47:50.94
Yeah, I'd say no, be here at 10.

2009
01:47:50.94 --> 01:47:51.94
Why not 130?

2010
01:47:51.94 --> 01:47:54.94
Because we're not training then we're training at 10.

2011
01:47:54.94 --> 01:47:55.94
We have a still to understand.

2012
01:47:55.94 --> 01:47:56.94
Okay, I want 30.

2013
01:47:56.94 --> 01:47:57.94
Hey, you can train.

2014
01:47:57.94 --> 01:47:58.94
Because that's what time we train.

2015
01:47:58.94 --> 01:47:59.94
What about 130?

2016
01:47:59.94 --> 01:48:00.94
What's the difference?

2017
01:48:00.94 --> 01:48:01.94
15 minutes.

2018
01:48:01.94 --> 01:48:02.94
We got to do things too.

2019
01:48:02.94 --> 01:48:03.94
There you go.

2020
01:48:03.94 --> 01:48:04.94
We have other things to do.

2021
01:48:04.94 --> 01:48:06.94
So I had like obligations.

2022
01:48:06.94 --> 01:48:10.94
Okay, this is not like a random thing that happens.

2023
01:48:10.94 --> 01:48:12.94
This is the steady state for years.

2024
01:48:12.94 --> 01:48:13.94
Yeah.

2025
01:48:13.94 --> 01:48:15.94
1148.

2026
01:48:15.94 --> 01:48:18.94
You probably count yourself as being early for me.

2027
01:48:18.94 --> 01:48:19.94
Yeah, I do.

2028
01:48:19.94 --> 01:48:20.94
I do.

2029
01:48:20.94 --> 01:48:23.94
1148 is when you come in and you see sweat.

2030
01:48:23.94 --> 01:48:24.94
Yeah.

2031
01:48:24.94 --> 01:48:25.94
Are you a little bit bummed out?

2032
01:48:25.94 --> 01:48:26.94
Yes.

2033
01:48:26.94 --> 01:48:27.94
Why, why do you not adjust your schedule?

2034
01:48:27.94 --> 01:48:29.94
Why don't you calendar yourself?

2035
01:48:29.94 --> 01:48:30.94
Well, because I don't know.

2036
01:48:30.94 --> 01:48:31.94
It's weird.

2037
01:48:31.94 --> 01:48:34.94
It's like, I'm on this, it's on, I'm on this like psychological pat-like.

2038
01:48:34.94 --> 01:48:35.94
You're lying to yourself.

2039
01:48:35.94 --> 01:48:36.94
No, no, no, no, no.

2040
01:48:36.94 --> 01:48:37.94
I'm not.

2041
01:48:37.94 --> 01:48:38.94
You're lying to yourself.

2042
01:48:38.94 --> 01:48:39.94
Hackworth says no.

2043
01:48:39.94 --> 01:48:40.94
I'm going to lie into yourself.

2044
01:48:40.94 --> 01:48:43.94
I'm going to go hit in the soon that I am lying to myself.

2045
01:48:43.94 --> 01:48:44.94
I have to do this.

2046
01:48:44.94 --> 01:48:48.94
I'm going to find it and admit it to myself.

2047
01:48:48.94 --> 01:48:50.94
But this is what it feels like.

2048
01:48:50.94 --> 01:48:51.94
Your comes the lie.

2049
01:48:51.94 --> 01:48:52.94
No, no, no.

2050
01:48:52.94 --> 01:48:55.94
Because this is like, it feels like it could be like this could be funny.

2051
01:48:55.94 --> 01:48:58.94
Like all week I do whatever whatever whatever.

2052
01:48:58.94 --> 01:48:59.94
Right.

2053
01:48:59.94 --> 01:49:02.94
That's just sort of in place.

2054
01:49:02.94 --> 01:49:03.94
It doesn't take much mental work.

2055
01:49:03.94 --> 01:49:06.94
But then if you're like, taxi me the night before saying, hey, 10.

2056
01:49:06.94 --> 01:49:08.94
I'm like, oh man, kind of in my mind.

2057
01:49:08.94 --> 01:49:11.94
I'm already kind of committed to the new to myself though.

2058
01:49:11.94 --> 01:49:13.94
You're all heavy, truly.

2059
01:49:13.94 --> 01:49:16.94
That seems the same thing.

2060
01:49:16.94 --> 01:49:17.94
I'm like, oh man, kind of in my mind.

2061
01:49:17.94 --> 01:49:20.94
I'm already kind of committed to the new to myself though.

2062
01:49:20.94 --> 01:49:21.94
You're all heavy, truly.

2063
01:49:21.94 --> 01:49:23.94
That seems the same thing.

2064
01:49:23.94 --> 01:49:32.94
This isn't just the lie.

2065
01:49:32.94 --> 01:49:38.94
It means like a whole conspiracy front against yourself.

2066
01:49:38.94 --> 01:49:41.94
Did you hear me?

2067
01:49:41.94 --> 01:49:42.94
Yeah.

2068
01:49:42.94 --> 01:49:43.94
That's ridiculous.

2069
01:49:43.94 --> 01:49:45.94
No, it's not ridiculous.

2070
01:49:45.94 --> 01:49:49.94
It's not ridiculous because I do have other news to do with any problem.

2071
01:49:49.94 --> 01:49:51.94
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2072
01:49:51.94 --> 01:49:52.94
I don't know.

2073
01:49:52.94 --> 01:49:53.94
I don't know.

2074
01:49:53.94 --> 01:49:55.94
I don't know.

2075
01:49:55.94 --> 01:49:57.94
But they all dare.

2076
01:49:57.94 --> 01:50:00.94
They are time sensitive in this sense that I do have to do them.

2077
01:50:00.94 --> 01:50:05.94
So if I plan to do them before training, now I got to shift all that.

2078
01:50:05.94 --> 01:50:08.94
Other stuff for like, you know, and there's other people involved.

2079
01:50:08.94 --> 01:50:10.94
That's not what I mean.

2080
01:50:10.94 --> 01:50:11.94
Anyway.

2081
01:50:11.94 --> 01:50:12.94
So it's usually the case.

2082
01:50:12.94 --> 01:50:13.94
But look if we're all known.

2083
01:50:13.94 --> 01:50:18.94
It's going to fall you down the path and it's kind of be a good.

2084
01:50:18.94 --> 01:50:21.94
You're right.

2085
01:50:21.94 --> 01:50:22.94
That's the thing.

2086
01:50:22.94 --> 01:50:23.94
And now they're, I know it's so funny.

2087
01:50:23.94 --> 01:50:24.94
Yeah, this is the truth.

2088
01:50:24.94 --> 01:50:25.94
This is this bad.

2089
01:50:25.94 --> 01:50:27.94
This is this good actually at the end of this.

2090
01:50:27.94 --> 01:50:30.94
So I'll have a lot of see this situation.

2091
01:50:30.94 --> 01:50:34.94
Yeah, I'm telling you and you're like laughing at me and telling me how I'm lying to myself.

2092
01:50:34.94 --> 01:50:38.94
That this situation goes on in a lot of ways with me with everyone.

2093
01:50:38.94 --> 01:50:41.94
But yeah, but you're going to confess right now.

2094
01:50:41.94 --> 01:50:42.94
I'm confessing this.

2095
01:50:42.94 --> 01:50:47.94
So when I tell you like out loud stuff and some of the stuff is like,

2096
01:50:47.94 --> 01:50:50.94
I just start telling you and just the work of your face and like,

2097
01:50:50.94 --> 01:50:51.94
I know the answer already.

2098
01:50:51.94 --> 01:50:52.94
And I know already.

2099
01:50:52.94 --> 01:50:55.94
And this is one of those things we're before I got into it.

2100
01:50:55.94 --> 01:50:56.94
I was like, for real committed to it.

2101
01:50:56.94 --> 01:50:57.94
Like, this is like true.

2102
01:50:57.94 --> 01:50:58.94
That's how it is.

2103
01:50:58.94 --> 01:50:59.94
And this is the reason.

2104
01:50:59.94 --> 01:51:01.94
And sometimes I'll come train with you guys.

2105
01:51:01.94 --> 01:51:03.94
You know, when I do all this work to shift it around,

2106
01:51:03.94 --> 01:51:05.94
but if I were to just shift it around and be like,

2107
01:51:05.94 --> 01:51:08.94
that's the new schedule, like I could do it.

2108
01:51:08.94 --> 01:51:09.94
It's a mirror.

2109
01:51:09.94 --> 01:51:12.94
I'm asking.

2110
01:51:12.94 --> 01:51:13.94
Alright, Brad.

2111
01:51:13.94 --> 01:51:14.94
See.

2112
01:51:14.94 --> 01:51:18.94
You know what I just realized is very good, a very,

2113
01:51:18.94 --> 01:51:19.94
a very solid quality.

2114
01:51:19.94 --> 01:51:24.94
And I've talked about, I always talk about people like everyone's allergic to criticism.

2115
01:51:24.94 --> 01:51:25.94
Like everyone hates getting criticized.

2116
01:51:25.94 --> 01:51:27.94
Like you tell me to do something different.

2117
01:51:27.94 --> 01:51:28.94
What are you talking about?

2118
01:51:28.94 --> 01:51:29.94
Yeah, yeah.

2119
01:51:29.94 --> 01:51:31.94
You're actually very open to criticism.

2120
01:51:31.94 --> 01:51:33.94
And I think part of it is because,

2121
01:51:33.94 --> 01:51:35.94
well, maybe it's because when I criticize you,

2122
01:51:35.94 --> 01:51:37.94
I'm not telling you like, I do what I do.

2123
01:51:37.94 --> 01:51:40.94
I'm just saying, like, hey, you tell me what your reason is.

2124
01:51:40.94 --> 01:51:43.94
And we'll figure out if you're, I just think you just figured out if you're alive yourself or not.

2125
01:51:43.94 --> 01:51:46.94
You're over on my side of the table over here.

2126
01:51:46.94 --> 01:51:48.94
We think we suspect,

2127
01:51:48.94 --> 01:51:51.94
we're suspect of the statement.

2128
01:51:51.94 --> 01:51:52.94
Yeah.

2129
01:51:52.94 --> 01:51:53.94
It's very suspect.

2130
01:51:53.94 --> 01:51:54.94
Alright, so.

2131
01:51:54.94 --> 01:51:55.94
So there it is.

2132
01:51:55.94 --> 01:51:58.94
Anyways, what the thing is,

2133
01:51:58.94 --> 01:52:00.94
maybe we can adjust that, maybe we can,

2134
01:52:00.94 --> 01:52:04.94
we can snuff out that lie, we can find all the truth isn't the truth is you should be training with your training.

2135
01:52:04.94 --> 01:52:06.94
Your normal training partners.

2136
01:52:06.94 --> 01:52:07.94
Yeah.

2137
01:52:07.94 --> 01:52:08.94
On the Sunday.

2138
01:52:08.94 --> 01:52:10.94
Whenever that, whenever that,

2139
01:52:10.94 --> 01:52:15.94
that agreed upon time is out there.

2140
01:52:15.94 --> 01:52:16.94
Ten of hearts nice.

2141
01:52:16.94 --> 01:52:17.94
Love in a car accident.

2142
01:52:17.94 --> 01:52:18.94
Ten of hearts nice.

2143
01:52:18.94 --> 01:52:20.94
You know what's nice?

2144
01:52:20.94 --> 01:52:21.94
It holds him.

2145
01:52:21.94 --> 01:52:23.94
When he means the whole gym,

2146
01:52:23.94 --> 01:52:24.94
I just empty.

2147
01:52:24.94 --> 01:52:26.94
Oh yeah, I just just kidding.

2148
01:52:26.94 --> 01:52:27.94
Just kidding after it.

2149
01:52:27.94 --> 01:52:28.94
Yeah.

2150
01:52:28.94 --> 01:52:30.94
Yeah, that is remember.

2151
01:52:30.94 --> 01:52:33.94
Remember when we first opened this gym up and you were like,

2152
01:52:33.94 --> 01:52:35.94
hey, we got new before the mats were all even in.

2153
01:52:35.94 --> 01:52:37.94
And you were like, there's new mats downstairs.

2154
01:52:37.94 --> 01:52:38.94
Remember that?

2155
01:52:38.94 --> 01:52:38.94
Yeah.

2156
01:52:38.94 --> 01:52:40.94
And then there was still some slippery.

2157
01:52:40.94 --> 01:52:42.94
I wanted to test them out.

2158
01:52:42.94 --> 01:52:43.94
Test the new mats.

2159
01:52:43.94 --> 01:52:44.94
Yeah.

2160
01:52:44.94 --> 01:52:45.94
And we were rolling for, like,

2161
01:52:45.94 --> 01:52:47.94
pretty long as far as two guys rolling,

2162
01:52:47.94 --> 01:52:49.94
and then you're like,

2163
01:52:49.94 --> 01:52:52.94
isn't it just so awesome when you have your own gym?

2164
01:52:52.94 --> 01:52:53.94
That's what you're doing.

2165
01:52:53.94 --> 01:52:55.94
But in sure I was like,

2166
01:52:55.94 --> 01:52:56.94
dang, man, that must be.

2167
01:52:56.94 --> 01:52:57.94
Like, because it's like,

2168
01:52:57.94 --> 01:52:59.94
you just had the whole bill, you know?

2169
01:52:59.94 --> 01:53:00.94
Yeah.

2170
01:53:00.94 --> 01:53:01.94
It is very nice.

2171
01:53:01.94 --> 01:53:03.94
Just sure that is a nice thing now.

2172
01:53:03.94 --> 01:53:05.94
Speaking of the juice.

2173
01:53:05.94 --> 01:53:06.94
Okay, everyone, we're going to do juice too.

2174
01:53:06.94 --> 01:53:07.94
That's what we're doing.

2175
01:53:07.94 --> 01:53:09.94
If you're on the path or looking or interested,

2176
01:53:09.94 --> 01:53:11.94
if the path is right for you,

2177
01:53:11.94 --> 01:53:12.94
kind of situation.

2178
01:53:12.94 --> 01:53:14.94
If someone's geek, curious.

2179
01:53:14.94 --> 01:53:15.94
And it is, yeah.

2180
01:53:15.94 --> 01:53:16.94
Yes.

2181
01:53:16.94 --> 01:53:17.94
And you're doing just so you're going to need a geek.

2182
01:53:17.94 --> 01:53:21.94
Because you can't just just do no geek as tempting as that might be.

2183
01:53:21.94 --> 01:53:22.94
It is tempting.

2184
01:53:22.94 --> 01:53:23.94
Do some geek.

2185
01:53:23.94 --> 01:53:25.94
It's tempting until you say,

2186
01:53:25.94 --> 01:53:27.94
what do you want to be so good in one thing,

2187
01:53:27.94 --> 01:53:30.94
and it's being lost with something that's so close.

2188
01:53:30.94 --> 01:53:31.94
Yeah.

2189
01:53:31.94 --> 01:53:33.94
And they both complement each other.

2190
01:53:33.94 --> 01:53:34.94
Yes.

2191
01:53:34.94 --> 01:53:35.94
They really do.

2192
01:53:35.94 --> 01:53:36.94
Yeah.

2193
01:53:36.94 --> 01:53:41.94
They're around of geek in that peak.

2194
01:53:41.94 --> 01:53:42.94
Yeah.

2195
01:53:42.94 --> 01:53:43.94
Yeah.

2196
01:53:43.94 --> 01:53:44.94
It was good.

2197
01:53:44.94 --> 01:53:45.94
It did some good rounds.

2198
01:53:45.94 --> 01:53:46.94
Good.

2199
01:53:46.94 --> 01:53:47.94
Did two players out there.

2200
01:53:47.94 --> 01:53:48.94
Yeah.

2201
01:53:48.94 --> 01:53:49.94
It's some good times.

2202
01:53:49.94 --> 01:53:50.94
But it was all geek.

2203
01:53:50.94 --> 01:53:51.94
Sure.

2204
01:53:51.94 --> 01:53:52.94
It was all geek.

2205
01:53:52.94 --> 01:53:54.94
I told JPM like, hey, I'm not bringing a geek.

2206
01:53:54.94 --> 01:53:58.94
And he's like, hey, just bring your belt.

2207
01:53:58.94 --> 01:54:01.94
And I'll get you a geek if you need it just for the class.

2208
01:54:01.94 --> 01:54:03.94
And you can roll a geek, no geek afterwards.

2209
01:54:03.94 --> 01:54:04.94
So I'm like, okay, cool.

2210
01:54:04.94 --> 01:54:06.94
And then I put the geek on how to geek.

2211
01:54:06.94 --> 01:54:08.94
If he's one of his geek's pants,

2212
01:54:08.94 --> 01:54:11.94
for two tight couldn't move my legs.

2213
01:54:11.94 --> 01:54:12.94
Mm-hmm.

2214
01:54:12.94 --> 01:54:14.94
Was it super ugly?

2215
01:54:14.94 --> 01:54:17.94
No, it was an origin geek.

2216
01:54:17.94 --> 01:54:18.94
Oh, well.

2217
01:54:18.94 --> 01:54:20.94
Because one of the warrior geek, the lightweight ones.

2218
01:54:20.94 --> 01:54:21.94
Yeah.

2219
01:54:21.94 --> 01:54:22.94
Anyway, yeah.

2220
01:54:22.94 --> 01:54:22.94
Yeah.

2221
01:54:22.94 --> 01:54:23.94
You got a bunch of good rounds.

2222
01:54:23.94 --> 01:54:24.94
Good.

2223
01:54:24.94 --> 01:54:25.94
Always fun.

2224
01:54:25.94 --> 01:54:26.94
Nikki, so yeah, you're going to need a geek.

2225
01:54:26.94 --> 01:54:27.94
If you're on the path, and you start your jitsu,

2226
01:54:27.94 --> 01:54:29.94
or you've already started your jitsu, you're going to need a geek.

2227
01:54:29.94 --> 01:54:30.94
What kind of geek do you need?

2228
01:54:30.94 --> 01:54:31.94
That's the question.

2229
01:54:31.94 --> 01:54:32.94
That's always the question.

2230
01:54:32.94 --> 01:54:33.94
You get an origin geek.

2231
01:54:33.94 --> 01:54:34.94
Not a question.

2232
01:54:34.94 --> 01:54:35.94
Not anymore.

2233
01:54:35.94 --> 01:54:36.94
No.

2234
01:54:36.94 --> 01:54:37.94
There it is.

2235
01:54:37.94 --> 01:54:38.94

Yes.

2248
01:54:57.94 --> 01:54:58.94
Okay.

2249
01:54:58.94 --> 01:54:59.94
You got rash guards.

Respect.

2263
01:55:24.94 --> 01:55:25.94
You know, his father and Lord Joe.

2264
01:55:25.94 --> 01:55:26.94
What were you doing?

2265
01:55:26.94 --> 01:55:27.94
Oh, yeah.

2266
01:55:27.94 --> 01:55:29.94
We were taking the picture at the immersion camp.

2267
01:55:29.94 --> 01:55:30.94
Yeah.

2268
01:55:30.94 --> 01:55:31.94
And he started like, Pete started getting all, hey, you

2269
01:55:31.94 --> 01:55:32.94
come over here a little bit.

2270
01:55:32.94 --> 01:55:33.94
Hey, we need to.

2271
01:55:33.94 --> 01:55:36.94
And it was really taking some artistic control in the situation.

2272
01:55:36.94 --> 01:55:39.94
I said, Joe, I said, here comes the big artist guy coming out.

2273
01:55:39.94 --> 01:55:40.94
Yeah.

2274
01:55:40.94 --> 01:55:41.94
You know, laughing.

2275
01:55:41.94 --> 01:55:42.94
Yeah, but yeah.

2276
01:55:42.94 --> 01:55:45.94
So he's got more than just a pinky in there.

2277
01:55:45.94 --> 01:55:45.94
Yeah.

2278
01:55:45.94 --> 01:55:46.94
Both pink.

2279
01:55:46.94 --> 01:55:47.94
He's at a minimum.

2280
01:55:47.94 --> 01:55:47.94
Well, good.

2281
01:55:47.94 --> 01:55:48.94
Because not everybody's like you and some people.

2282
01:55:48.94 --> 01:55:50.94
They like that fashion element.

2283
01:55:50.94 --> 01:55:53.94
Actually, I was going to talk to Pete about this.

2284
01:55:53.94 --> 01:55:55.94
So Pete, he's listening right now.

2285
01:55:55.94 --> 01:55:56.94
Sure.

2286
01:55:56.94 --> 01:56:01.94
I was actually a very accurate statement when I said, when we had this conversation before,

2287
01:56:01.94 --> 01:56:09.94
my ultimate goal of fashion is to make no impression.

2288
01:56:09.94 --> 01:56:10.94
Yeah.

2289
01:56:10.94 --> 01:56:13.94
And I guess that's completely the wrong thing to do.

2290
01:56:13.94 --> 01:56:14.94
Yes, sir.

2291
01:56:14.94 --> 01:56:16.94
But that's my thing.

2292
01:56:16.94 --> 01:56:22.94
If you, I want my clothing to look in such a way that when you look at me, you just see,

2293
01:56:22.94 --> 01:56:24.94
you know what you see?

2294
01:56:24.94 --> 01:56:25.94
What?

2295
01:56:25.94 --> 01:56:26.94
Normally normal.

2296
01:56:26.94 --> 01:56:27.94
Okay.

2297
01:56:27.94 --> 01:56:28.94
Just a film normal.

2298
01:56:28.94 --> 01:56:29.94
Like just normal clothes.

2299
01:56:29.94 --> 01:56:31.94
Like you wouldn't be able to say, I bet that guy.

2300
01:56:31.94 --> 01:56:34.94
Now the exception that I have to ask, I got the victory of a T-shirt.

2301
01:56:34.94 --> 01:56:35.94
That's your thing.

2302
01:56:35.94 --> 01:56:36.94
Yeah.

2303
01:56:36.94 --> 01:56:39.94
And the reason I have that is because I have a bunch of them.

2304
01:56:39.94 --> 01:56:41.94
And I just wear the same thing every day.

2305
01:56:41.94 --> 01:56:42.94
Yeah.

2306
01:56:42.94 --> 01:56:43.94
So I have that little thing.

2307
01:56:43.94 --> 01:56:47.94
But if you see me traveling when I'm not wearing T-shirt, I'm going to be wearing something

2308
01:56:47.94 --> 01:56:50.94
where you just think, oh, this is just a normal person.

2309
01:56:50.94 --> 01:56:51.94
Yeah.

2310
01:56:51.94 --> 01:56:53.94
This person has no nothing.

2311
01:56:53.94 --> 01:56:54.94
Right?

2312
01:56:54.94 --> 01:56:55.94
No thing.

2313
01:56:55.94 --> 01:56:56.94
Yeah.

2314
01:56:56.94 --> 01:57:01.94
Well, so if you, I don't want to call this a mistake.

2315
01:57:01.94 --> 01:57:06.94
But here's the thing that makes that it almost like an antiquated kind of scenario.

2316
01:57:06.94 --> 01:57:07.94
Okay.

2317
01:57:07.94 --> 01:57:12.94
Because you're like, my goal is, you said, my goal is to be normal, whatever.

2318
01:57:12.94 --> 01:57:15.94
If that's your goal, your, your is not to make a statement, right?

2319
01:57:15.94 --> 01:57:18.94
You know, you're, that's your fashion.

2320
01:57:18.94 --> 01:57:20.94
Oh, that's your statement.

2321
01:57:20.94 --> 01:57:25.94
So by just by way of your whole discourse, you're doing what you're trying to do.

2322
01:57:25.94 --> 01:57:30.94
It's kind of like, um, well, I guess I, I guess what I, I guess I should have phrased it differently.

2323
01:57:30.94 --> 01:57:35.94
What I normally would wear is just stuff that works.

2324
01:57:35.94 --> 01:57:36.94
No one leaves.

2325
01:57:36.94 --> 01:57:44.94
Although I guess, yeah, no, I guess there is, I guess in this day and age, you have to make some kind of an effort.

2326
01:57:44.94 --> 01:57:49.94
So I guess in, you know, in a horrible way, I'm making some kind of a fashion effort.

2327
01:57:49.94 --> 01:57:51.94
Yeah, no, you know what, you know who you are, though?

2328
01:57:51.94 --> 01:57:53.94
This is what it feels like anyway.

2329
01:57:53.94 --> 01:57:57.94
A day, however you want to explain this, what if you remember Bruce Lee when he was like on the boat.

2330
01:57:57.94 --> 01:57:59.94
He was going to, I don't know which one it was.

2331
01:57:59.94 --> 01:58:01.94
Another dragon made me, he's on the boat, right?

2332
01:58:01.94 --> 01:58:03.94
Going over to wherever.

2333
01:58:03.94 --> 01:58:04.94
Yeah.

2334
01:58:04.94 --> 01:58:06.94
And the guy's like, what's your style?

2335
01:58:06.94 --> 01:58:10.94
And he's like, my style is fighting without fighting.

2336
01:58:10.94 --> 01:58:12.94
That's your style right there.

2337
01:58:12.94 --> 01:58:14.94
It's fashion without fashion.

2338
01:58:14.94 --> 01:58:16.94
Browse looking at old pictures of us.

2339
01:58:16.94 --> 01:58:17.94
Yeah.

2340
01:58:17.94 --> 01:58:19.94
Like, all like, I don't know, like, oh, no.

2341
01:58:19.94 --> 01:58:20.94
Yeah.

2342
01:58:20.94 --> 01:58:21.94
10 or something.

2343
01:58:21.94 --> 01:58:22.94
10 years ago.

2344
01:58:22.94 --> 01:58:23.94
Yeah.

2345
01:58:23.94 --> 01:58:26.94
And work is like me, you, J, and I think, Tim was there.

2346
01:58:26.94 --> 01:58:28.94
And then, you know, it's like whatever you being you.

2347
01:58:28.94 --> 01:58:31.94
Same you by the way, same exact, like, joke, quote, normal face.

2348
01:58:31.94 --> 01:58:33.94
And guess what you're wearing.

2349
01:58:33.94 --> 01:58:34.94
Victory, T sure.

2350
01:58:34.94 --> 01:58:35.94
Yeah.

2351
01:58:35.94 --> 01:58:36.94
That's your whole uniform, right?

2352
01:58:36.94 --> 01:58:38.94
I got a lot of women.

2353
01:58:38.94 --> 01:58:40.94
It's, you know, you're straight forward.

2354
01:58:40.94 --> 01:58:41.94
I dig it anyways.

2355
01:58:41.94 --> 01:58:42.94
Fashion without fashion.

2356
01:58:42.94 --> 01:58:43.94
That's a joke.

2357
01:58:43.94 --> 01:58:44.94
Luckily Pete's got your back.

2358
01:58:44.94 --> 01:58:45.94
Yeah.

2359
01:58:45.94 --> 01:58:52.94
Well, this is cool because Pete also has a sense of that who else is making a black-on-black sweatshirt, right?

2360
01:58:52.94 --> 01:58:54.94
There's no, you can't see the origin.

2361
01:58:54.94 --> 01:58:56.94
I mean, you can see it, but you got it, you know?

2362
01:58:56.94 --> 01:58:57.94
Yeah.

2363
01:58:57.94 --> 01:58:59.94
You're not drawing attention to yourself.

2364
01:58:59.94 --> 01:59:00.94
Yeah.

2365
01:59:00.94 --> 01:59:01.94
I guess that's the thing, right?

2366
01:59:01.94 --> 01:59:03.94
Trying to try attention to yourself.

2367
01:59:03.94 --> 01:59:04.94
Yeah.

2368
01:59:04.94 --> 01:59:06.94
Just be a little bit more laid back with that stuff.

2369
01:59:06.94 --> 01:59:07.94
I feel like, yeah.

2370
01:59:07.94 --> 01:59:10.94
Because cool for guys used to make fun of me at Seal Team 2.

2371
01:59:10.94 --> 01:59:13.94
Because I had, that was when I was competing all the time.

2372
01:59:13.94 --> 01:59:17.94
So I had like, and they suggested like the main thing you'd get from a GG tournament

2373
01:59:17.94 --> 01:59:19.94
and a little cheesy metal and a T-shirt.

2374
01:59:19.94 --> 01:59:22.94
I had all these, I had different T-shirt.

2375
01:59:22.94 --> 01:59:23.94
I had different GG T-shirt.

2376
01:59:23.94 --> 01:59:25.94
So there, guess what I was doing.

2377
01:59:25.94 --> 01:59:27.94
Just wearing what I was given, but guess what?

2378
01:59:27.94 --> 01:59:28.94
It kind of stood out.

2379
01:59:28.94 --> 01:59:29.94
Yes.

2380
01:59:29.94 --> 01:59:30.94
Yeah.

2381
01:59:30.94 --> 01:59:32.94
Even though these all just free T-shirts.

2382
01:59:32.94 --> 01:59:33.94
Yeah.

2383
01:59:33.94 --> 01:59:34.94
Well, although I paid for the Hicks and Grayson,

2384
01:59:34.94 --> 01:59:37.94
I had to have some Graystit T-shirt and paid some money for that one.

2385
01:59:37.94 --> 01:59:38.94
That's cool.

2386
01:59:38.94 --> 01:59:40.94
The old Peaco street academy.

2387
01:59:40.94 --> 01:59:42.94
Some old school people remember that right now.

2388
01:59:42.94 --> 01:59:43.94
Yeah.

2389
01:59:43.94 --> 01:59:46.94
We were best in the West, best of the West.

2390
01:59:46.94 --> 01:59:47.94
There was a judiciary.

2391
01:59:47.94 --> 01:59:50.94
Yeah, I remember that, but that was little later.

2392
01:59:50.94 --> 01:59:52.94
I'm talking old school grappling games.

2393
01:59:52.94 --> 01:59:54.94
I'm talking Joe Morera.

2394
01:59:54.94 --> 01:59:55.94
No.

2395
01:59:55.94 --> 01:59:57.94
I'm talking about Graysee.

2396
01:59:57.94 --> 02:00:00.94
The Graysee was a Graysee-invitational.

2397
02:00:00.94 --> 02:00:01.94
Graysee Nationals.

2398
02:00:01.94 --> 02:00:02.94
Graysee Nationals.

2399
02:00:02.94 --> 02:00:04.94
I think it's, it's, it's, it's called the Graysee Nationals.

2400
02:00:04.94 --> 02:00:05.94
Newtual grounds.

2401
02:00:05.94 --> 02:00:07.94
The court is going old school.

2402
02:00:07.94 --> 02:00:08.94
It's cool.

2403
02:00:08.94 --> 02:00:09.94
It's cool.

2404
02:00:09.94 --> 02:00:10.94
The limit to the charter.

2405
02:00:10.94 --> 02:00:11.94
Oh, yeah.

2406
02:00:11.94 --> 02:00:12.94
The hangman.

2407
02:00:12.94 --> 02:00:14.94
I could go down memory lane with you.

2408
02:00:14.94 --> 02:00:15.94
You know, it's not do it.

2409
02:00:15.94 --> 02:00:20.94
But anyway, yeah, judiciary get, get origin, get all origin stuff for judiciary.

2410
02:00:20.94 --> 02:00:21.94
That's, that's the spot to go.

2411
02:00:21.94 --> 02:00:25.94
Even like the, the joggers and the sweats sweat stuff.

2412
02:00:25.94 --> 02:00:26.94
Mm-hmm.

2413
02:00:26.94 --> 02:00:27.94
Most comfortable in the world.

2414
02:00:27.94 --> 02:00:28.94
Boom.

2415
02:00:28.94 --> 02:00:29.94
Also supplements.

2416
02:00:29.94 --> 02:00:31.94
You can get some supplements.

2417
02:00:31.94 --> 02:00:32.94
Joint warfare.

2418
02:00:32.94 --> 02:00:34.94
Getting some rave, the lake babbin.

2419
02:00:34.94 --> 02:00:36.94
He said he went off joint warfare.

2420
02:00:36.94 --> 02:00:37.94
Mm-hmm.

2421
02:00:37.94 --> 02:00:38.94
I think he said four or five days.

2422
02:00:38.94 --> 02:00:40.94
Whatever he's on the trip.

2423
02:00:40.94 --> 02:00:41.94
Yeah.

2424
02:00:41.94 --> 02:00:43.94
And he said his knees started hurting again.

2425
02:00:43.94 --> 02:00:44.94
Hey, back.

2426
02:00:44.94 --> 02:00:46.94
Went back on the joint warfare.

2427
02:00:46.94 --> 02:00:47.94
Guess what?

2428
02:00:47.94 --> 02:00:48.94
Knee healed up.

2429
02:00:48.94 --> 02:00:49.94
I mean, he, I don't know.

2430
02:00:49.94 --> 02:00:51.94
Healed, but it's no longer sore.

2431
02:00:51.94 --> 02:00:52.94
Better.

2432
02:00:52.94 --> 02:00:53.94
Yeah.

2433
02:00:53.94 --> 02:00:54.94
Yeah, man.

2434
02:00:54.94 --> 02:00:55.94
That's all.

2435
02:00:55.94 --> 02:00:57.94
You know what's, you know, so fun is like me, I'm all like surprised.

2436
02:00:57.94 --> 02:00:59.94
When it was, my experience just like, you know,

2437
02:00:59.94 --> 02:01:03.94
obviously, it's surprised enough to tell you about it, you know, and just like me,

2438
02:01:03.94 --> 02:01:04.94
where's like dang bro?

2439
02:01:04.94 --> 02:01:07.94
I told him, I told him we put illegal stuff and joy.

2440
02:01:07.94 --> 02:01:11.94
I told him I was like, hey man, don't tell anyone, but we put some little, we put some little,

2441
02:01:11.94 --> 02:01:12.94
stick right on.

2442
02:01:12.94 --> 02:01:13.94
Yeah.

2443
02:01:13.94 --> 02:01:14.94
Yeah.

2444
02:01:14.94 --> 02:01:15.94
And he was all lucky.

2445
02:01:15.94 --> 02:01:18.94
He didn't eat it, probably, me for point three seconds, because he didn't really

2446
02:01:18.94 --> 02:01:20.94
believe me that much, but then I was like, no, I'm just kidding man.

2447
02:01:20.94 --> 02:01:21.94
But.

2448
02:01:21.94 --> 02:01:21.94
Yeah.

2449
02:01:21.94 --> 02:01:22.94
Anyway.

2450
02:01:22.94 --> 02:01:23.94
Yeah.

2451
02:01:23.94 --> 02:01:26.94
But nonetheless, isn't that supposed, isn't that odd though that we're all surprised,

2452
02:01:26.94 --> 02:01:27.94
surprised?

2453
02:01:27.94 --> 02:01:29.94
It's supposed to do that, you know?

2454
02:01:29.94 --> 02:01:31.94
Like it's supposed to do these things.

2455
02:01:31.94 --> 02:01:34.94
Yeah, but I think the level that it does it do is a little more,

2456
02:01:34.94 --> 02:01:36.94
the what people expect.

2457
02:01:36.94 --> 02:01:37.94
Yeah.

2458
02:01:37.94 --> 02:01:38.94
There you go.

2459
02:01:38.94 --> 02:01:40.94
Get on the crilloile too.

2460
02:01:40.94 --> 02:01:45.94
Now, discipline.

2461
02:01:45.94 --> 02:01:51.94
We've got some debates going on on whether Dave, you know, Dave Burke, could do,

2462
02:01:51.94 --> 02:01:52.94
yeah.

2463
02:01:52.94 --> 02:01:58.94
Whether he should be the actual representative, clearly he's a representative of discipline.

2464
02:01:58.94 --> 02:01:59.94
Yes.

2465
02:01:59.94 --> 02:02:04.94
But for milk and the full milk train, he's a little lean.

2466
02:02:04.94 --> 02:02:05.94
Yeah, he's lean.

2467
02:02:05.94 --> 02:02:07.94
He is the lean representative of milk.

2468
02:02:07.94 --> 02:02:09.94
He's the before pick.

2469
02:02:09.94 --> 02:02:10.94
That's cold blood.

2470
02:02:10.94 --> 02:02:17.94
Well, I, you know, maybe if there's less than like weight, I don't want to get all big.

2471
02:02:17.94 --> 02:02:21.94
Hey, Dave Burke, he's on the milk train fully on the milk train.

2472
02:02:21.94 --> 02:02:22.94
Yeah.

2473
02:02:22.94 --> 02:02:23.94
And he's not huge.

2474
02:02:23.94 --> 02:02:24.94
Yeah.

2475
02:02:24.94 --> 02:02:26.94
Well, well, let's break it down.

2476
02:02:26.94 --> 02:02:32.94
So to me personally, I don't think Dave Burke should be the poster child for milk.

2477
02:02:32.94 --> 02:02:36.94
Shouldn't be.

2478
02:02:36.94 --> 02:02:38.94
Wait, is he trapped on your territory?

2479
02:02:38.94 --> 02:02:40.94
That's not the class of the year anyway.

2480
02:02:40.94 --> 02:02:43.94
I should have, I should have, I should have read into this more.

2481
02:02:43.94 --> 02:02:46.94
So the idea, you know, you're the representative of the board.

2482
02:02:46.94 --> 02:02:48.94
But technically, he could be technically, he could be.

2483
02:02:48.94 --> 02:02:49.94
So what protein, right?

2484
02:02:49.94 --> 02:02:55.94
Protein additional protein because, look, you work out, you lift, you work out, you do, you know, all this,

2485
02:02:55.94 --> 02:02:59.94
actually hard exercise, boom protein is part of the recovery process.

2486
02:02:59.94 --> 02:03:03.94
A big part of the recovery, home building blocks for lack of a better term, whatever.

2487
02:03:03.94 --> 02:03:07.94
And boom, the milk comes in, boom, right?

2488
02:03:07.94 --> 02:03:09.94
But the milk tastes good, right?

2489
02:03:09.94 --> 02:03:13.94
So here, and here's this side note, this is why it's important for it to taste good.

2490
02:03:13.94 --> 02:03:15.94
This may or may not go against your whole state.

2491
02:03:15.94 --> 02:03:17.94
Actually, well, not a one, it won't, it won't.

2492
02:03:17.94 --> 02:03:19.94
Seems like wood, but it tastes good.

2493
02:03:19.94 --> 02:03:23.94
So let's say I'm like, I'm on the fence about working out.

2494
02:03:23.94 --> 02:03:25.94
I don't know, you can't relate to that part, but let's say you are.

2495
02:03:25.94 --> 02:03:26.94
I get it right.

2496
02:03:26.94 --> 02:03:28.94
But then, you're like, wait, but when I work out,

2497
02:03:28.94 --> 02:03:30.94
I can take the milk.

2498
02:03:30.94 --> 02:03:32.94
So it like fits in, you know,

2499
02:03:32.94 --> 02:03:34.94
it won. There's one with the other.

2500
02:03:34.94 --> 02:03:35.94
That's the best thing.

2501
02:03:35.94 --> 02:03:38.94
Yeah, no, there's guys that just thought just the supplements alone would get him to.

2502
02:03:38.94 --> 02:03:39.94
Yeah, exactly, right? Yes.

2503
02:03:39.94 --> 02:03:40.94
And that's part of the point.

2504
02:03:40.94 --> 02:03:44.94
Because you don't, just, just so everyone knows, you don't have to work out to have milk.

2505
02:03:44.94 --> 02:03:47.94
You can have milk without working, but it will taste better if you work out.

2506
02:03:47.94 --> 02:03:52.94
Well, if you take milk or any, like, additional protein for the reason you take protein,

2507
02:03:52.94 --> 02:03:56.94
I'm saying, and you don't work out, there's no reason to take it.

2508
02:03:56.94 --> 02:03:57.94
True.

2509
02:03:57.94 --> 02:03:59.94
So you'm saying, like any excess calories that are.

2510
02:03:59.94 --> 02:04:02.94
Except for the fact that milk tastes good.

2511
02:04:02.94 --> 02:04:04.94
Yeah, you can actually just take milk.

2512
02:04:04.94 --> 02:04:07.94
Just like there's no reason to eat ice cream and then chocolate,

2513
02:04:07.94 --> 02:04:08.94
you buy ice cream, except for a taste real good.

2514
02:04:08.94 --> 02:04:11.94
Yeah, but that's the slippery slope, though, that's not the path.

2515
02:04:11.94 --> 02:04:13.94
So officially, by the way, and we established this,

2516
02:04:13.94 --> 02:04:16.94
this was, I think I was talking to Lief, but we'd,

2517
02:04:16.94 --> 02:04:18.94
the opposite of the path is the slippery slope.

2518
02:04:18.94 --> 02:04:19.94
Yeah.

2519
02:04:19.94 --> 02:04:22.94
Okay, you can step off the path for 10 minutes for one day for one week,

2520
02:04:22.94 --> 02:04:25.94
but keep in mind the more you're, the more time you spend off the path.

2521
02:04:25.94 --> 02:04:27.94
You're going to slip a slippery slope.

2522
02:04:27.94 --> 02:04:32.94
So boom, unless if your home mindset is to drink milk just because it tastes good,

2523
02:04:32.94 --> 02:04:37.94
no exercise, no this, but you're, that's the wrong path.

2524
02:04:37.94 --> 02:04:39.94
You're going in the wrong direction.

2525
02:04:39.94 --> 02:04:43.94
Yeah, we'll speed by the way, but it's got a foot on the slippery slope at that point.

2526
02:04:43.94 --> 02:04:46.94
Yeah, and you're kind of, you're facing the wrong way.

2527
02:04:46.94 --> 02:04:48.94
Yeah, that tastes good.

2528
02:04:48.94 --> 02:04:49.94
Boom, same reason.

2529
02:04:49.94 --> 02:04:50.94
But you're not, you're, you're, you're,

2530
02:04:50.94 --> 02:04:52.94
pizza you're two feet off.

2531
02:04:52.94 --> 02:04:53.94
That's true.

2532
02:04:53.94 --> 02:04:55.94
Milk, one foot on the path.

2533
02:04:55.94 --> 02:04:57.94
Milk and working out, you're on the path.

2534
02:04:57.94 --> 02:05:00.94
Okay, real quick, because we're getting crazy here.

2535
02:05:00.94 --> 02:05:03.94
We got mentholca chip, we got peanut butter, chocolate,

2536
02:05:03.94 --> 02:05:05.94
Dave works favorite, mentholca because it's my favorite.

2537
02:05:05.94 --> 02:05:06.94
What's your favorite?

2538
02:05:06.94 --> 02:05:07.94
Mint, mint, mint, mint.

2539
02:05:07.94 --> 02:05:09.94
But you make some because you're psycho.

2540
02:05:09.94 --> 02:05:14.94
Well, and then now new two new flavors are out, vanilla gorilla.

2541
02:05:14.94 --> 02:05:20.94
And we got a chocolate, which is called The Darkness.

2542
02:05:20.94 --> 02:05:23.94
We're not going to beat vanilla gorilla.

2543
02:05:23.94 --> 02:05:26.94
I was like, hey, no, we need to make it vanilla gorilla.

2544
02:05:26.94 --> 02:05:29.94
And then he, he like paused, we were texting.

2545
02:05:29.94 --> 02:05:31.94
And he's like, wait, seriously.

2546
02:05:31.94 --> 02:05:34.94
And I was like, yes, and he made a little crazy looking vanilla gorilla,

2547
02:05:34.94 --> 02:05:36.94
a little white gorilla.

2548
02:05:36.94 --> 02:05:39.94
So anyways, vanilla gorilla is the name.

2549
02:05:39.94 --> 02:05:41.94
And the chocolate, of course, is called Darkness.

2550
02:05:41.94 --> 02:05:45.94
And if you don't know, there are layers to both those comments.

2551
02:05:45.94 --> 02:05:48.94
If you know about the darkness, then know that one.

2552
02:05:48.94 --> 02:05:52.94
If you know, if you know life, when you can figure out the vanilla gorilla.

2553
02:05:52.94 --> 02:05:59.94
Yeah, yes, these are all impeccable things.

2554
02:05:59.94 --> 02:06:04.94
Kind of, yeah, impeccable, that might not be the correct word, but they are impeccable things to stand,

2555
02:06:04.94 --> 02:06:05.94
keep you on the path.

2556
02:06:05.94 --> 02:06:06.94
100% indeed.

2557
02:06:06.94 --> 02:06:07.94
100% indeed.

2558
02:06:07.94 --> 02:06:12.94
Also, chocolate's door is called Jocco Store.

2559
02:06:12.94 --> 02:06:16.94
This is where you can get shirts and hoodies and hats.

2560
02:06:16.94 --> 02:06:21.94
More rash cards, different feel, different, not physical feel, but different different.

2561
02:06:21.94 --> 02:06:23.94
There was kind of this is pretty cool.

2562
02:06:23.94 --> 02:06:30.94
At the roll call when we did Gigi to, there was people in the I've never done Gigi to before,

2563
02:06:30.94 --> 02:06:33.94
area, they had rash cards.

2564
02:06:33.94 --> 02:06:35.94
They had Jocco Store rash cards.

2565
02:06:35.94 --> 02:06:37.94
They had Defcore rash cards.

2566
02:06:37.94 --> 02:06:38.94
Yeah.

2567
02:06:38.94 --> 02:06:40.94
And they had origin rash cards.

2568
02:06:40.94 --> 02:06:41.94
Yeah.

2569
02:06:41.94 --> 02:06:43.94
A lot of stuff, a lot of stuff.

2570
02:06:43.94 --> 02:06:47.94
And you can just look at that one room, it was filled with a lot of stuff that's made in America,

2571
02:06:47.94 --> 02:06:48.94
which is a big deal.

2572
02:06:48.94 --> 02:06:49.94
There was.

2573
02:06:49.94 --> 02:06:52.94
And that says a lot for someone who's never done Gigi to get, they have the rash cards.

2574
02:06:52.94 --> 02:06:55.94
So that's kind of like, in a way, I don't want to say commitment necessarily because

2575
02:06:55.94 --> 02:06:56.94
This means good stuff.

2576
02:06:56.94 --> 02:06:59.94
I could admit, what if I bet you there was people there that said,

2577
02:06:59.94 --> 02:07:03.94
I'm going to try the Gigi to and I'm going to continue down the path.

2578
02:07:03.94 --> 02:07:04.94
Yeah.

2579
02:07:04.94 --> 02:07:06.94
As people know, you got to get on the Gigi to path.

2580
02:07:06.94 --> 02:07:07.94
Yeah.

2581
02:07:07.94 --> 02:07:08.94
That's just part of the deal.

2582
02:07:08.94 --> 02:07:09.94
Yeah.

2583
02:07:09.94 --> 02:07:11.94
I think we'll have a guy question me.

2584
02:07:11.94 --> 02:07:12.94
Yeah.

2585
02:07:12.94 --> 02:07:13.94
Yeah.

2586
02:07:13.94 --> 02:07:14.94
At the roll call.

2587
02:07:14.94 --> 02:07:20.94
After we got done teaching, he's like, so is Gigi to the best thing to start with.

2588
02:07:20.94 --> 02:07:21.94
As opposed to.

2589
02:07:21.94 --> 02:07:22.94
Bop.

2590
02:07:22.94 --> 02:07:23.94
Anything.

2591
02:07:23.94 --> 02:07:26.94
I was like, yeah, man.

2592
02:07:26.94 --> 02:07:28.94
We did you hear everything I just said.

2593
02:07:28.94 --> 02:07:29.94
Come on, man.

2594
02:07:29.94 --> 02:07:30.94
Yeah.

2595
02:07:30.94 --> 02:07:31.94
Do it.

2596
02:07:31.94 --> 02:07:32.94
Yeah.

2597
02:07:32.94 --> 02:07:35.94
I said, what about, what about like striking though?

2598
02:07:35.94 --> 02:07:39.94
And I said, well, you know, start with boxing, get to, get to, get to Mojitai when you get good at boxing.

2599
02:07:39.94 --> 02:07:41.94
You can start opening it up a little bit.

2600
02:07:41.94 --> 02:07:42.94
He's like, oh, should I start with that?

2601
02:07:42.94 --> 02:07:45.94
I was like, no, because if I grab you, that's not going to work anymore.

2602
02:07:45.94 --> 02:07:46.94
Right.

2603
02:07:46.94 --> 02:07:49.94
And if some bad guy grabbed you, that's not going to work anymore.

2604
02:07:49.94 --> 02:07:50.94
So anyways.

2605
02:07:50.94 --> 02:07:51.94
Yeah.

2606
02:07:51.94 --> 02:07:52.94
Yeah.

2607
02:07:52.94 --> 02:07:55.94
I always try to put myself in like outside of my own brain.

2608
02:07:55.94 --> 02:07:58.94
Because you know, when like, if someone asks me to touch them.

2609
02:07:58.94 --> 02:07:59.94
Yeah.

2610
02:07:59.94 --> 02:08:04.94
If they're like, hey, is Gigi to the best martial arm like not even the other options don't even

2611
02:08:04.94 --> 02:08:05.94
enter.

2612
02:08:05.94 --> 02:08:06.94
You know, it's just like, yes, yes, like constant.

2613
02:08:06.94 --> 02:08:07.94
Yes, thing.

2614
02:08:07.94 --> 02:08:09.94
But I'm like, wait, you know, let me.

2615
02:08:09.94 --> 02:08:10.94
Let me consider this.

2616
02:08:10.94 --> 02:08:12.94
You know, I'm like, try it.

2617
02:08:12.94 --> 02:08:13.94
Let go of some of my bias.

2618
02:08:13.94 --> 02:08:15.94
Anyway, back to Jockel store.

2619
02:08:15.94 --> 02:08:16.94
We got some good stuff on there.

2620
02:08:16.94 --> 02:08:21.94
If you want to represent the path, discipline equals freedom straight up.

2621
02:08:21.94 --> 02:08:22.94
Because it does.

2622
02:08:22.94 --> 02:08:23.94
It's the uniform for the path.

2623
02:08:23.94 --> 02:08:24.94
It is.

2624
02:08:24.94 --> 02:08:25.94
Yes.

2625
02:08:25.94 --> 02:08:25.94
Yeah.

2626
02:08:25.94 --> 02:08:26.94
That's a good way of putting it.

2627
02:08:26.94 --> 02:08:27.94
Oh, it's a.

2628
02:08:27.94 --> 02:08:30.94
There's the new discipline equals freedom shirt.

2629
02:08:30.94 --> 02:08:30.94
Yeah.

2630
02:08:30.94 --> 02:08:31.94
Sure.

2631
02:08:31.94 --> 02:08:31.94
Is it different?

2632
02:08:31.94 --> 02:08:32.94
No.

2633
02:08:32.94 --> 02:08:33.94
Is it standing out?

2634
02:08:33.94 --> 02:08:34.94
No.

2635
02:08:34.94 --> 02:08:36.94
These things are all kind of, you know, it's just how.

2636
02:08:36.94 --> 02:08:37.94
These are fashion items.

2637
02:08:37.94 --> 02:08:39.94
Well, but they do make a stand.

2638
02:08:39.94 --> 02:08:40.94
They do make a stand.

2639
02:08:40.94 --> 02:08:41.94
They do make a stand.

2640
02:08:41.94 --> 02:08:42.94
Yeah.

2641
02:08:42.94 --> 02:08:44.94
Is that called to me to everything my friend?

2642
02:08:44.94 --> 02:08:45.94
Yes, sir.

2643
02:08:45.94 --> 02:08:46.94
There is.

2644
02:08:46.94 --> 02:08:48.94
You know, yeah, if you want to represent, you want to represent in the wild.

2645
02:08:48.94 --> 02:08:52.94
But they're, they're guys with the shirt that you design with my head on it.

2646
02:08:52.94 --> 02:08:53.94
Yep.

2647
02:08:53.94 --> 02:08:55.94
But I don't think I've ever felt more honored in my life.

2648
02:08:55.94 --> 02:08:57.94
That was pretty good.

2649
02:08:57.94 --> 02:08:58.94
It was pretty solid.

2650
02:08:58.94 --> 02:09:00.94
Multiple people wearing the dang shirt.

2651
02:09:00.94 --> 02:09:02.94
You decide not to.

2652
02:09:02.94 --> 02:09:03.94
Design.

2653
02:09:03.94 --> 02:09:05.94
For I guess you called the nag shirt.

2654
02:09:05.94 --> 02:09:06.94
Yeah.

2655
02:09:06.94 --> 02:09:08.94
Well, you know, now you're going to keep it.

Anyway, if you want to represent jockelstore.com, also, if you want to support.

Or passing the word spread the word past the word.

2661
02:09:20.94 --> 02:09:21.94

02:09:21.94 --> 02:09:22.94

He's got his own business.

2681
02:09:53.94 --> 02:09:54.94
He's making soap.

2682
02:09:54.94 --> 02:09:56.94
And that's awesome.

2683
02:09:56.94 --> 02:09:59.94
From goat milk of goats that he raised himself.

2684
02:09:59.94 --> 02:10:01.94
And then he, he, the whole process.

2685
02:10:01.94 --> 02:10:02.94
He sent me all these pictures of it.

2686
02:10:02.94 --> 02:10:03.94
What he actually does.

2687
02:10:03.94 --> 02:10:04.94
He's got a man.

2688
02:10:04.94 --> 02:10:06.94
He's got a man.

2689
02:10:06.94 --> 02:10:08.94
You factoring thing going on.

2690
02:10:08.94 --> 02:10:09.94
In America.

2691
02:10:09.94 --> 02:10:10.94
Yeah, in America.

2692
02:10:10.94 --> 02:10:11.94
By the way, goats.

2693
02:10:11.94 --> 02:10:13.94
The goats are American goats.

2694
02:10:13.94 --> 02:10:15.94
Yeah.

2695
02:10:15.94 --> 02:10:16.94
Yeah.

2696
02:10:16.94 --> 02:10:17.94
Also YouTube.

2697
02:10:17.94 --> 02:10:18.94
We got the YouTube channel.

2698
02:10:18.94 --> 02:10:23.94
And that is where that is where echoes legit videos are.

2699
02:10:23.94 --> 02:10:27.94
And he's putting them up on a pretty regular basis.

2700
02:10:27.94 --> 02:10:31.94
And he's got a plan in place to increase that even more.

2701
02:10:31.94 --> 02:10:32.94
Sure.

2702
02:10:32.94 --> 02:10:35.94
And as long as that fits his schedule.

2703
02:10:35.94 --> 02:10:40.94
And then we got psychological warfare.

2704
02:10:40.94 --> 02:10:45.94
That's an album with tracks of me talking and telling you why you should do something instead

2705
02:10:45.94 --> 02:10:48.94
of not do something or why you should not do something instead of do something.

2706
02:10:48.94 --> 02:10:50.94
How to stand the bad reason.

2707
02:10:50.94 --> 02:10:51.94
Sleepy slope calls.

2708
02:10:51.94 --> 02:10:52.94
There you go.

2709
02:10:52.94 --> 02:10:53.94
So get on that.

2710
02:10:53.94 --> 02:10:54.94
Yeah.

2711
02:10:54.94 --> 02:10:57.94
That's available through all the places you can MP3s.

2712
02:10:57.94 --> 02:10:58.94
Yeah.

2713
02:10:58.94 --> 02:11:00.94
What about psychological warfare too?

2714
02:11:00.94 --> 02:11:01.94
It's common.

2715
02:11:01.94 --> 02:11:02.94
We're working on it.

2716
02:11:02.94 --> 02:11:03.94
Yes sir.

2717
02:11:03.94 --> 02:11:05.94
Also on it.

2718
02:11:05.94 --> 02:11:07.94
.com slash jockel by the way.

2719
02:11:07.94 --> 02:11:11.94
This is where you can get your other fitness gear.

2720
02:11:11.94 --> 02:11:16.94
So remember back in the day we had the there's actually back.

2721
02:11:16.94 --> 02:11:19.94
When you're explain the essentials of home home gym.

2722
02:11:19.94 --> 02:11:20.94
Yes.

2723
02:11:20.94 --> 02:11:21.94
Number one.

2724
02:11:21.94 --> 02:11:22.94
So look when you're growing.

2725
02:11:22.94 --> 02:11:23.94
Number one is rings.

2726
02:11:23.94 --> 02:11:24.94
Which I got from on it by the way.

2727
02:11:24.94 --> 02:11:26.94
Which actually the kids enjoy those two.

2728
02:11:26.94 --> 02:11:27.94
Yeah.

2729
02:11:27.94 --> 02:11:28.94
They're fun.

2730
02:11:28.94 --> 02:11:29.94
Nice quality quality.

2731
02:11:29.94 --> 02:11:33.94
And then the last one you're expanding your home gym in the event of you having a home gym.

2732
02:11:33.94 --> 02:11:35.94
Or even if you don't have a home gym.

2733
02:11:35.94 --> 02:11:38.94
This is where you can get the stuff to sort of begin that.

2734
02:11:38.94 --> 02:11:40.94
Really good stuff on there.

2735
02:11:40.94 --> 02:11:43.94
Cattle bells is my I would say that's my number one.

2736
02:11:43.94 --> 02:11:45.94
Number one thing to have.

2737
02:11:45.94 --> 02:11:46.94
That would be my recommendation.

2738
02:11:46.94 --> 02:11:47.94
You say everything.

2739
02:11:47.94 --> 02:11:48.94
You say rings.

2740
02:11:48.94 --> 02:11:49.94
Can you pull up on kettle bells bro?

2741
02:11:49.94 --> 02:11:50.94
No.

2742
02:11:50.94 --> 02:11:51.94
No.

2743
02:11:51.94 --> 02:11:51.94
I know.

2744
02:11:51.94 --> 02:11:52.94
Wait.

2745
02:11:52.94 --> 02:11:53.94
Do you like pull ups?

2746
02:11:53.94 --> 02:11:54.94
I like pull up.

2747
02:11:54.94 --> 02:11:55.94
Why can't really do now.

2748
02:11:55.94 --> 02:11:56.94
You know what?

2749
02:11:56.94 --> 02:11:58.94
In your game when you're when you're when you're 100%.

2750
02:11:58.94 --> 02:11:59.94
Yeah.

2751
02:11:59.94 --> 02:12:00.94
I mean, yes, but not like you like pull ups.

2752
02:12:00.94 --> 02:12:01.94
Like it's in.

2753
02:12:01.94 --> 02:12:02.94
How you have your.

2754
02:12:02.94 --> 02:12:03.94
The ones you like.

2755
02:12:03.94 --> 02:12:06.94
Like when I started kettle bells, I really like that.

2756
02:12:06.94 --> 02:12:07.94
My thought is super fun.

2757
02:12:07.94 --> 02:12:08.94
Because there's a lot.

2758
02:12:08.94 --> 02:12:09.94
Anyway, they're fun.

2759
02:12:09.94 --> 02:12:10.94
I get them from on it.

2760
02:12:10.94 --> 02:12:11.94
And there's a lot of cool.

2761
02:12:11.94 --> 02:12:12.94
Other cool stuff on there.

2762
02:12:12.94 --> 02:12:15.94
So yeah, go on it dot com slash jaco.

2763
02:12:15.94 --> 02:12:17.94
Also jaco white tea.

2764
02:12:17.94 --> 02:12:19.94
You can get the tea bags or get the can.

2765
02:12:19.94 --> 02:12:22.94
And when you get the tea bags or you get the can either one.

2766
02:12:22.94 --> 02:12:24.94
It doesn't matter because what you get with that.

2767
02:12:24.94 --> 02:12:26.94
You get a 8,000 pound deadlift 100% guaranteed.

2768
02:12:26.94 --> 02:12:29.94
Although I did have one guy complain at roll call.

2769
02:12:29.94 --> 02:12:32.94
His deadlifts only 7,400.

2770
02:12:32.94 --> 02:12:38.94
So, I mean, yeah, he's probably, I told him to get after the harder.

2771
02:12:38.94 --> 02:12:39.94
And then you got some books.

2772
02:12:39.94 --> 02:12:42.94
Also the the tea is available on Amazon.

2773
02:12:42.94 --> 02:12:44.94
And the store and jaco store.

2774
02:12:44.94 --> 02:12:45.94
And jaco store.

2775
02:12:45.94 --> 02:12:46.94
There you go.

2776
02:12:46.94 --> 02:12:47.94
I figure ultimately you.

2777
02:12:47.94 --> 02:12:49.94
We will unify.

2778
02:12:49.94 --> 02:12:50.94
Yeah.

2779
02:12:50.94 --> 02:12:52.94
Well, I guess the kind of the goal.

2780
02:12:52.94 --> 02:12:55.94
The short term goes kind of make it just available.

2781
02:12:55.94 --> 02:12:58.94
Yeah, like if you're going to grab a shirt, rash guard, whatever.

2782
02:12:58.94 --> 02:12:59.94
And you're like, hey, let me grab tea too.

2783
02:12:59.94 --> 02:13:00.94
Good point.

2784
02:13:00.94 --> 02:13:03.94
Also I saw an Amazon store when we were in Dallas or not.

2785
02:13:03.94 --> 02:13:04.94
Not Amazon store.

2786
02:13:04.94 --> 02:13:07.94
And Amazon, like obvious shipping facility.

2787
02:13:07.94 --> 02:13:08.94
Mm-hmm.

2788
02:13:08.94 --> 02:13:09.94
This thing was.

2789
02:13:09.94 --> 02:13:11.94
Huge.

2790
02:13:11.94 --> 02:13:16.94
I was surrounded by trucks that were backed up to it.

2791
02:13:16.94 --> 02:13:17.94
You know, loading docks.

2792
02:13:17.94 --> 02:13:18.94
Mm-hmm.

2793
02:13:18.94 --> 02:13:19.94
It was crazy.

2794
02:13:19.94 --> 02:13:20.94
There's totally nuts.

2795
02:13:20.94 --> 02:13:22.94
And I was like in there somewhere.

2796
02:13:22.94 --> 02:13:24.94
There's a little bit of jaco white tea.

2797
02:13:24.94 --> 02:13:27.94
Getting ready to roll out and increase somebody's deadlift.

2798
02:13:27.94 --> 02:13:28.94
And maybe I'll do it.

2799
02:13:28.94 --> 02:13:29.94
Yeah.

2800
02:13:29.94 --> 02:13:30.94
That's what it looks like.

2801
02:13:30.94 --> 02:13:32.94
They all said books in there.

2802
02:13:32.94 --> 02:13:33.94
Yeah.

2803
02:13:33.94 --> 02:13:34.94
Jaco books.

2804
02:13:34.94 --> 02:13:35.94
Jaco books.

2805
02:13:35.94 --> 02:13:36.94
Yes.

2806
02:13:36.94 --> 02:13:37.94
They had way to work.

2807
02:13:37.94 --> 02:13:38.94
Mm-hmm.

2808
02:13:38.94 --> 02:13:39.94
You think they had that one?

2809
02:13:39.94 --> 02:13:40.94
I know.

2810
02:13:40.94 --> 02:13:41.94
They absolutely do.

2811
02:13:41.94 --> 02:13:43.94
They had the field manual.

2812
02:13:43.94 --> 02:13:45.94
So the way to work it and Mark's mission.

2813
02:13:45.94 --> 02:13:49.94
I signed so many of those books at roll call.

2814
02:13:49.94 --> 02:13:53.94
And of like, personal messages to the kids and everything.

2815
02:13:53.94 --> 02:13:55.94
The kids are getting on the path.

2816
02:13:55.94 --> 02:13:57.94
This is factual.

2817
02:13:57.94 --> 02:13:58.94
Mm-hmm.

2818
02:13:58.94 --> 02:13:59.94
Awesome.

2819
02:13:59.94 --> 02:14:06.94
So get the books for your kids and get them a pull-up bar and get them a jajitsu class.

2820
02:14:06.94 --> 02:14:08.94
Because that's what they're going to want to do.

2821
02:14:08.94 --> 02:14:11.94
And those two things are going to help them through their entire life.

2822
02:14:11.94 --> 02:14:12.94
Yeah.

2823
02:14:12.94 --> 02:14:13.94
They're in entire life.

2824
02:14:13.94 --> 02:14:14.94
Yeah.

2825
02:14:14.94 --> 02:14:15.94
And that's actually a good head's up.

2826
02:14:15.94 --> 02:14:18.94
Because like if you're like, hey, you already got the pull-up bar.

2827
02:14:18.94 --> 02:14:21.94
And like they just took classes scouted out, you know, and then so you're just ready.

2828
02:14:21.94 --> 02:14:22.94
You're ready for the request.

2829
02:14:22.94 --> 02:14:26.94
Because your kids are going to be, they're going to want to get on the path.

2830
02:14:26.94 --> 02:14:27.94
Yeah.

2831
02:14:27.94 --> 02:14:33.94
And I think it was you who's telling this to where I was reading the part where you have to fix up his bike.

2832
02:14:33.94 --> 02:14:35.94
They ought to want to spoil or spoil anything.

2833
02:14:35.94 --> 02:14:38.94
But anyway, he needed money.

2834
02:14:38.94 --> 02:14:39.94
Okay.

2835
02:14:39.94 --> 02:14:40.94
He needed money.

2836
02:14:40.94 --> 02:14:43.94
So he's like, hey, to get money, you got to get a job.

2837
02:14:43.94 --> 02:14:45.94
And you know, it lays out the whole thing.

2838
02:14:45.94 --> 02:14:47.94
All the layers of things is pretty good.

2839
02:14:47.94 --> 02:14:51.94
So right after I was done with that chapter, my five-year-old daughter by the way.

2840
02:14:51.94 --> 02:14:55.94
Oh, because she kind of sits back almost disappointed looking.

2841
02:14:55.94 --> 02:14:58.94
She goes, she goes, I always shy had a job.

2842
02:14:58.94 --> 02:15:03.94
I was like, oh, hey, I don't think I was feeling a work ethic into a kid that's five years old.

2843
02:15:03.94 --> 02:15:09.94
About wanting to work and wanting to have a job and wanting to, that's just like legit.

2844
02:15:09.94 --> 02:15:10.94
Yeah.

2845
02:15:10.94 --> 02:15:11.94
So get those books.

2846
02:15:11.94 --> 02:15:14.94
Where the work, get marks mentioned.

2847
02:15:14.94 --> 02:15:17.94
You can also get the discipline equals freedom field manual.

2848
02:15:17.94 --> 02:15:19.94
I was under tone of those.

2849
02:15:19.94 --> 02:15:20.94
Yeah.

2850
02:15:20.94 --> 02:15:26.94
Again, there's some people that that book hit them hard.

2851
02:15:26.94 --> 02:15:27.94
Yeah.

2852
02:15:27.94 --> 02:15:27.94
Hard.

2853
02:15:27.94 --> 02:15:30.94
And they made some significant changes in their lives.

2854
02:15:30.94 --> 02:15:32.94
So everyone that came up to me and told me that, thank you.

2855
02:15:32.94 --> 02:15:34.94
And I appreciate that feedback.

2856
02:15:34.94 --> 02:15:42.94
And it's awesome to see that book hitting people the way that it hit me when I wrote it.

2857
02:15:42.94 --> 02:15:43.94
Yeah.

2858
02:15:43.94 --> 02:15:45.94
And it's awesome to see.

2859
02:15:45.94 --> 02:15:51.94
In fact, that beginning part is what you're reading today, there is no hack.

2860
02:15:51.94 --> 02:15:52.94
Yep.

2861
02:15:52.94 --> 02:15:59.94
There's no sweatless, uh, pursue, this sweatless pursuit, sweatless direction.

2862
02:15:59.94 --> 02:16:00.94
Yeah.

2863
02:16:00.94 --> 02:16:01.94
Definitely.

2864
02:16:01.94 --> 02:16:08.94
And then, of course, there's extreme ownership, which is written by me and my brother, Leipabin.

2865
02:16:08.94 --> 02:16:13.94
Combat leadership for using your business and life.

2866
02:16:13.94 --> 02:16:16.94
And we also have this week just released.

2867
02:16:16.94 --> 02:16:22.94
So this, this is live now at this time, order it immediately.

2868
02:16:22.94 --> 02:16:23.94
The dichotomy leadership.

2869
02:16:23.94 --> 02:16:27.94
A couple reviews already up there because some people got some advanced copies.

2870
02:16:27.94 --> 02:16:28.94
Awesome reviews.

2871
02:16:28.94 --> 02:16:31.94
Everyone is stoked, including me and life.

2872
02:16:31.94 --> 02:16:34.94
You know, we wrote it and, you know, we'd added each other.

2873
02:16:34.94 --> 02:16:36.94
And it'd be like, bro, nice chapter.

2874
02:16:36.94 --> 02:16:37.94
Like, bro, nice chapter.

2875
02:16:37.94 --> 02:16:40.94
I'm like, hey, you know, so yeah.

2876
02:16:40.94 --> 02:16:45.94
Yeah, we, we critique each other and edit each other.

2877
02:16:45.94 --> 02:16:49.94
So, uh, the book is, it just takes it to another granular level.

2878
02:16:49.94 --> 02:16:50.94
That's what it does.

2879
02:16:50.94 --> 02:16:53.94
Takes it down to another granular level.

2880
02:16:53.94 --> 02:16:59.94
I think, and some people are saying that there are more people going to get more out of that economy.

2881
02:16:59.94 --> 02:17:01.94
Leadership than they did in our extreme ownership.

2882
02:17:01.94 --> 02:17:02.94
Hmm.

2883
02:17:02.94 --> 02:17:04.94
They definitely compliment each other.

2884
02:17:04.94 --> 02:17:08.94
But there's a lot to be learned.

2885
02:17:08.94 --> 02:17:13.94
A lot of the mistakes that people make are going to be corrected through the dichotomy of leadership.

2886
02:17:13.94 --> 02:17:14.94
Yeah.

2887
02:17:14.94 --> 02:17:18.94
Yeah, because you know, when people make a change in their whatever, you know, they make,

2888
02:17:18.94 --> 02:17:22.94
it's like, what do you actually, your, the first of my heard this over-corrected.

2889
02:17:22.94 --> 02:17:23.94
Over-corrected.

2890
02:17:23.94 --> 02:17:24.94
Yes, yes.

2891
02:17:24.94 --> 02:17:29.94
People will over-correct all the time and they throw off the balance of the dichotomy of leadership.

2892
02:17:29.94 --> 02:17:30.94
Yeah.

2893
02:17:30.94 --> 02:17:33.94
And so when you read the dichotomy of leadership, you'll become aware of that.

2894
02:17:33.94 --> 02:17:35.94
You'll see what the signs are and you'll be able to correct them.

2895
02:17:35.94 --> 02:17:39.94
And this is going to, this is going to really help out leaders in the world.

2896
02:17:39.94 --> 02:17:41.94
So dichotomy of leadership available now.

2897
02:17:41.94 --> 02:17:43.94
I mean, I think of that.

2898
02:17:43.94 --> 02:17:46.94
This book's been in the work for a long time.

2899
02:17:46.94 --> 02:17:47.94
And now it's out.

2900
02:17:47.94 --> 02:17:48.94
It's released.

2901
02:17:48.94 --> 02:17:49.94
It's in the wild.

2902
02:17:49.94 --> 02:17:49.94
Hmm.

2903
02:17:49.94 --> 02:17:53.94
So get some, get some for your people you work with.

2904
02:17:53.94 --> 02:17:56.94
We appreciate that support.

2905
02:17:56.94 --> 02:17:59.94
And then, of course, we've got a leadership company.

2906
02:17:59.94 --> 02:18:03.94
Leadership consulting company, Esslant Front, a We-Solve leader.

2907
02:18:03.94 --> 02:18:05.94
We solve problems through leadership.

2908
02:18:05.94 --> 02:18:06.94
That's what we do.

2909
02:18:06.94 --> 02:18:07.94
It's me.

2910
02:18:07.94 --> 02:18:10.94
It's Lave Babin, JPDNL, Dave Burke, Flynn Cochran, Mike Surelli.

2911
02:18:10.94 --> 02:18:12.94
We also got Mike Bahamon.

2912
02:18:12.94 --> 02:18:15.94
Did you do you were there for Mike Bahamus part of Rolkall?

2913
02:18:15.94 --> 02:18:16.94
Meingun Mike?

2914
02:18:16.94 --> 02:18:17.94
Meingun Mike.

2915
02:18:17.94 --> 02:18:19.94
I'm going to play that.

2916
02:18:19.94 --> 02:18:21.94
That's like a new Marty.

2917
02:18:21.94 --> 02:18:22.94
Yeah.

2918
02:18:22.94 --> 02:18:27.94
So we got another member, Army retired tenant Colonel, who is with us in the battle or

2919
02:18:27.94 --> 02:18:34.94
Marty, a company commander, then tanker and badass.

2920
02:18:34.94 --> 02:18:39.94
If you want, if you need help, leadership at your company with your team, whatever it may be,

2921
02:18:39.94 --> 02:18:41.94
go to Esslantfront.com.

2922
02:18:41.94 --> 02:18:42.94
We've also got the Master coming up.

2923
02:18:42.94 --> 02:18:43.94
Rolkall's done.

2924
02:18:43.94 --> 02:18:44.94
Sorry you missed it.

2925
02:18:44.94 --> 02:18:45.94
It was awesome.

2926
02:18:45.94 --> 02:18:47.94
Come next time.

2927
02:18:47.94 --> 02:18:53.94
In the meantime, Master 006 San Francisco October 17, 19th.

2928
02:18:53.94 --> 02:18:55.94
We're danger close right now.

2929
02:18:55.94 --> 02:19:01.94
If you hear this podcast and you listen to it on, you know, in September, hopefully, maybe,

2930
02:19:01.94 --> 02:19:06.94
I don't know, check the website, extremlororship.com, all of them sold out or danger

2931
02:19:06.94 --> 02:19:07.94
close on this one.

2932
02:19:07.94 --> 02:19:08.94
But check it out.

2933
02:19:08.94 --> 02:19:10.94
We can just sometimes squeeze in a few more seats.

2934
02:19:10.94 --> 02:19:14.94
And of course, we also have EF Overwatch. EF Overwatch.com.

2935
02:19:14.94 --> 02:19:23.94
This is for businesses, for businesses that want leaders, tested, battle-tested, special

2936
02:19:23.94 --> 02:19:29.94
operations, leaders from the special operations community or from a combat aviation community.

2937
02:19:29.94 --> 02:19:34.94
You want those people, those leaders at your business.

2938
02:19:34.94 --> 02:19:36.94
Go to EF Overwatch.com.

2939
02:19:36.94 --> 02:19:37.94
That we are.

2940
02:19:37.94 --> 02:19:43.94
We have our friends, our colleagues, people we know, our connections inside the special

2941
02:19:43.94 --> 02:19:46.94
operations and inside the combat aviation community.

2942
02:19:46.94 --> 02:19:52.94
They're trained, they're ready, and they will come and help your business through

2943
02:19:52.94 --> 02:19:54.94
solid leadership.

2944
02:19:54.94 --> 02:19:58.94
Again, that's EF Overwatch.com.

2945
02:19:58.94 --> 02:20:04.94
And if you want to keep communicating with us, then you can do it through the

2946
02:20:04.94 --> 02:20:13.94
in-webs, through Twitter, perhaps through Instagram or on the FACC.

2947
02:20:13.94 --> 02:20:16.94
Bwah.

2948
02:20:16.94 --> 02:20:20.94
Echo is at Echo Charles and I am at Jocca Whilling and thanks.

2949
02:20:20.94 --> 02:20:25.94
It's all of you that make this podcast possible.

2950
02:20:25.94 --> 02:20:27.94
And that's not some big corporate sponsor.

2951
02:20:27.94 --> 02:20:33.94
No, it's the military personnel around the world that keep our country free.

2952
02:20:33.94 --> 02:20:35.94
It's all the first responders out there.

2953
02:20:35.94 --> 02:20:39.94
Police law enforcement, correction officers, firefighters, border patrol,

2954
02:20:39.94 --> 02:20:43.94
paramedics, all of you that keep us safe on the home front.

2955
02:20:43.94 --> 02:20:45.94
Thanks to all of you for what you do.

2956
02:20:45.94 --> 02:20:48.94
And everyone else, it's out there.

2957
02:20:48.94 --> 02:20:50.94
Thank you for listening.

2958
02:20:50.94 --> 02:20:52.94
Thank you for spreading the word.

2959
02:20:52.94 --> 02:20:54.94
Thank you for supporting what we do.

2960
02:20:54.94 --> 02:20:59.94
But most of all, thanks for telling yourself the truth.

2961
02:20:59.94 --> 02:21:05.94
Thanks for not looking for that sweatless solution or that easy road.

2962
02:21:05.94 --> 02:21:12.94
Because the sweatless solution and the easy road don't exist.

2963
02:21:12.94 --> 02:21:17.94
To get on the path and to stay on the path that gets you to where you want to be.

2964
02:21:17.94 --> 02:21:23.94
There is going to be sweat and there's going to be hard work and there's going to be discipline.

2965
02:21:23.94 --> 02:21:31.94
And you are going to have to look at yourself and tell yourself the truth.

2966
02:21:31.94 --> 02:21:39.94
And then, of course, you're going to have to get after it.

2967
02:21:39.94 --> 02:21:46.94
And until next time, this is Echo and Jocco out.

2968
02:21:46.94 --> 02:21:48.94
Thank you.
