and then the exo's Sealteen Iraq deployment though um so come back and and for for everybody listening we're really good about succession planning and the Seals you know you once you're in the seat a seat for two or three years you're thinking how you have to get out of your seat and make room for the next guy and we do these diversity tours I was fortunate my first diversity tour was you know graduate school for two years in Cambridge mass and it was time for me to get out of my chair as the exo is Sealteen 10 and I applied for the White House Fellowship it's a non military program it is a great leadership public service program I threw you know that's a through my name and the hat it's quite an extensive application for us and ultimately was picked the their thousands of applicants the nation picks 14 to be White House Fellows every year and I got placed as the director for defense policy and strategy for Bush so literally report to the national security adviser who reports to the president like day seven I'm running my first meetings in the White House situation room it like the who is a lot of steep learning walking around pretending like you know how to you're wearing a washing in DC you know I'm like you know dumb team guy all of a sudden thrown in the policy world but you got speaking of getting this job in the selection process you got a cool thing in here that that talks about that a little bit going back to the book my interviewer sat me down and asked a bunch of questions a bunch of introductory questions then stared at me with intensity and said Mike what do you know about the start treaty I took a breath looked at him and said with dead pan seriousness I know how to spell it honestly I didn't know anything about our nation's nuclear treaties not a bit but what I did know and I told him this too was how to get the right people into a room and how to run the decision making process I knew how to figure out what motivated people how to get them to generate ideas how to cooperate and ultimately how to leave the room with the best possible outcome I wasn't afraid to admit that I didn't know a thing about nuclear policy and I think that's what got me the job being humble enough to admit that being humble enough to admit what you don't know but still confident enough to explain where you can add value is a balance that's often hard to strike but you need to recognize that it's a strength not a weakness to know what's beyond your knowledge or understanding at any point in time instead of pretending otherwise I walk into any room and always assume that people in it are smarter than I am faster than I am and more agile than I am that way I can never be wrong I never assume I have the idea I have an idea maybe it's the best one or maybe it's not but honestly it shouldn't even matter because our job in any room is to find the best answer for the problem we're working on no matter who's answer it is we have to listen to each other and really hear each other and the best way to do that is to walk into the room knowing there's no doubt that everyone in there has something useful to say so that's how you ended up with that job not by being this not by being the smartest guy about nuclear treaties but by saying hey look I don't know everything about that it was a legit they they legit three week one week of each other three phases of training and you know when you're going through it you're like how does this compare with the real thing it was after going through the real thing I look back and say we got a legit full treatment for each of the three weeks and I think nowadays they use that sort of it's called something else now I think it's called seal officer assessment and selection and it's it's something like mini buds but it's sort of the selection and how they're going to figure out who gets to go was it like that for for you guys I they definitely was we came out with like grades out of the 32 you know like not grades as an academic but like just an all around score of how you did and and you know I remember having a pretty high number and thought I think I'll be probably this will stand me pretty well if I applied to to circle back and go to buds and history has it I did and they took 16 guys out of ROTC my year 16 guys out of the academy so there are 32 officers taken into the program and as you know I don't know the number maybe 15 of those made it through ultimately or something like that there's only quid quitters and mini buds and it's a wake up called everybody to the recognition of what's going on out in that battlefield every single day which which you know you could hear it going on you could see it going on you could see vehicles you could see guys getting cows are backed out we were given blood whenever we could get blood like just that heavy reality of going to these scenarios um you guys you guys finish your work up you go on that that pre-depollement and now you got your platoon your your team over there your whole team never mind just the platoon now you got the whole team and it's not just your team that's you got SF guys you've got you've got an entire like force here it sounds like from the book you you had a little bit of a rough relationship with the conventional commander that was there initially with the one who was right next to me in Terran Coutt this guy just didn't want to get out and put his force at risk to go do great things and you know as well as I do you just you just don't respect people that don't want to do their job and like you know these days we think of a tech cooperation center you know we're talking plasma TV's in satellite links and internet you're talking you know like a star track look in scenario I shit you not we went on this mission and I fit this quote tactical operation center into one single rock sack I had like a sack for seventy seven hundred dollars something I had a bunch of maps I had some like I thought I was square away because I had you know like some overlays for the maps and then how much the world changed between that time and I were good friends former roommates but classmates 20 years earlier we had come up the ranks together before we each got married and started our families we shared a house in Virginia Beach for three years we were inseparable in those days we had bonded over our mutual frustration at the pull-up bar during buds training one Saturday morning after we both failed the day before to come him anywhere close to matching the 15 to 20 pull-ups our fellow trainees were able to do we decided to go find a pull-up bar to practice on far away from the buds compound we're no one would stumble upon us despite a full night's sleep we were still struggling as we fought as we each fought through our fourth pull-up I can still see his face and here the chuckle in his voice as he turned to me and said world's finest right here he was loyal genuine a man who could find humor in absolutely anything another time in training we were so cold on a boat ride back to the compound after an icy swim that we found ourselves fighting over where to place one rubber fin that was shielding very small parts of us from the 49 winds there we were two grown adults seal trainees fighting over a tiny rubber fin to help make us a tiny bit warmer and we and just a little drop less miserable we stopped for a moment and realized what we were fighting over and we both just broke out in hysterical laughter it seemed like we were always laughing back then when I was deployed he would check in on my family and when he was deployed I would check in on his I would say that I trusted him with my life except that it was so much more than that as seals we have no choice but to trust everyone on our team with our life every minute of every day on the battlefield but when you bond with someone it's not so much about trusting them with your life it's about wanting them to be there in the trenches with you feeling better because you know they're right alongside you he was so much more than a fellow seal he was a friend a teammate a brother a shiny example of the bravery a human being can exhibit you know you talk about the pressure and the pace and the battle rhythm or lack of rhythm and the lives it's stake and it's it's it's hard to describe what that feels like look I think one of the things that that young officers always wrestle with is how to walk the line between being a leader when a leader is needed to step forward but at the same time really have the humility that a lot of other people know a lot of things that you don't know and to me that's what makes the team special is is when you think about how you make decisions and who makes decisions we just grow up with that just built into who we are and and and and that's really uh you know the the the thing you test is when do I step forward and say all right guys shut up lock it on we're going this direction and when do you kind of step back like like like you you a spouse in a lot of your work is leading from the rear is but I did an incredible excel rocky Russell and who I would super supreme confidence in so I I'd go out on an operation and be with the the the Afghan commandos in a seal platoon for I don't know a day and a half two days at times and that's a that's a tough decision also because as soon as you swing and go on one operation with one unit dude you don't know what's happening with the other 24 so that takes an element of like confidence and trust but of course as you know it makes you a better leader because it helps you understand and maintain perspective and frankly just to share the same risk as the guys you know and and as of whatever I'm 51 now is a 41-ish year old seal team commander you know that deployment we got shot at and rocketed and the the I cut one of my guys legs off on that deployment and just wanted to have this. but you know hey as we got out of Afghanistan what went wrong the thing that went wrong was policy process broke down who are we bringing home we didn't have a question answer to that question and so that caused a lot of chaos and a little a lot of people rush to an airport hoping to get onto a flight you know so anyways that that's just one example of the how policy the the engine and the machine should work how many hours a day are you working in those long hours that was you know I'd get in it you know I always get my workout in the morning I honestly got there you know 737 eight clocks and like that and I forgot to mention the I know that the team thought incredibly highly of your and and Eshelon front's leadership and instruction and motivation and inspiration everything that you are that you espouse has made a huge positive impact on people and whenever that that finished up I think it was about a week ago or something like one of them was the most recent was about a week ago I got eat multiple emails saying hey this guy's awesome everything from like people who know that we know each other and others like hey you ever heard of this willing guy you know That's where all my like it was night after night of stopping bad think people from doing bad things to good people you know we were literally like vampire hours one cycle of darkness operations you know as soon as the the the sun goes down that think about you know you very your operation do you leave the FoB at 1030 pm or 1145 pm you know it's like and you go you know what we're just gonna stay out in the field like you told us you know well that that seems like the right call right now there's a little bit different here um going to the book to ensure civilian casualties where's limited is possible and that the innocent afghan civilians wouldn't turn against our forces the military set up a policy called boots on the ground battled damage assessment this meant that after every bomb we dropped we were we were required to physically go to the site to confirm that no civilians had been killed the theory a smart theory was that knowing we would have to acknowledge civilian casualties would make it less likely that there would be any civilian casualties a talented team of army green berets within my command had intelligence at one point that there were approximately 10 Taliban members gathered together at three in the morning in an area no civilian would ever go and certainly not at that time the team used surveillance techniques to view the site and we knew as a certainty that there were no civilians there they asked me for permission to drop a bomb from an unmanned aircraft and following the decision making process I'd put in place I granted it they went ahead and eight of the Taliban fighters were killed an army colonel from the commanding general staff in afghanistan called and asked my watch officer for our BDA report and my watch officer explained that we didn't have one that it was simply too much risk for not a good enough reason the road to the site was too dangerous to travel I mean of course you know I'd been exposed to everything already in my career but when you really feel that you feel that you are the owner of the risk of the whole team it's a different feeling there's a I used to think when I was second in charge of a seal team that it wouldn't really be that different to be overall in charge I couldn't have been more wrong so when I when a senior leadership team from from seal team to did our advanced reconnaissance if you will we came home on a meta-vac where I'll never forget there was a young man who was blown up in an IED who was really just being flown to Germany just so he could pass away in Germany next to his wife he was in a coma and I'll never forget like a you know six or eight hour flight just spending it next to this whole guy just my hand on him talking to him and just some army trooper who I don't even don't even know his name but like when you're really around that I got back to the states and I I already worked hard but it didn't work I realized I must have drifted much more than I expected I couldn't see back to the beach either for a few hours I was basically lost at sea worrying the other three more experience seals would think I was a total screw up I'd broken a fin strap and at one point I was startled okay scared when I was moved about 10 feet in the water bumped hard by a massive sea mammal I imagine that no one would ever find my body and everyone in the seals would think I must not a bit been a good swimmer despite entering buds training with one of the fastest swim times in the history the program and along with my swim buddy Chris Cassidy coming seconds away from the fastest ever two mile swim in buds finally the boat found me and picked me up and I was quickly exerated for being stupid enough to make the swim back out to sea my three teammates had ended up down the beach from where the current had taken me just a bit too far away from me to see them and they stayed on the beach until the boat came for them knowing conditions were too miserable to even attempt to head back I'd put myself at risk for a training exercise because I can fuse doing the hard thing with doing the right thing my decision was far too risky to make sense even as a confident and capable swimmer there's so many little lessons in that one right there that little story and by the way so your book is filled with a bunch of lessons and obviously I'm just reading excerpts from it and this chapter was choosing the hard path and doing the hard thing and of course everything's a dichotomy and you can do things where you go too hard but I can't even imagine you with your silver ranger which is for those of you that don't know it's a little compass that used to navigate on the land and you they you probably had it with you for like E&D or some whatever but you know growing up in the teams before 9-11 it was mission mission mission at all costs post 9-11 our community got much better at saying you know what there's new information let's incorporate new information what's going on let's think about risk is the risk worth the reward and constantly reassessing that risk you know it's it's uh it became okay to turn around on a mission in our raccara Afghanistan and say hey you know what the risk profile just change massively we'll come back another right for these this group of terrorists there's this risk is not worth assuming and let's not do the mission and and when I was growing up and when you were growing up we'd be excoriated for not doing the mission and we knew there were no civilians present and to ask anyone on my team to go down this isolated path in the middle of the night was an unnecessary risk to their lives and one it made no sense to take I got on the phone with the carnal and we went back and forth this is the policy but the policy in this case makes no sense to achieve an already known outcome I will not take unnecessary risk that my men will die there are consequences in the military for not following the orders of a superior truth is the lack of organizational flexibility is a huge problem for the military on the ground we were living a never agile enough kind of life but in terms of the larger hierarchy the structure had its weaknesses I could have been fired and sent home from the appointment as an in subordinate but in that moment I couldn't I couldn't just blindly follow the policy I had to act consistently with my values and make a judgment and subsequent decision that I was going to be able to live with if the worst happened the carnal said that since I wouldn't comply he was going to report my noncompliance to his boss the commanding general in Afghanistan and that he would ask his peer in charge of our Afghan partner force to order his men to unilaterally inspect the site instead I urged him not to do that but that decision was out of my hands 12 Afghan soldiers drove down that isolated road in three vehicles to make their assessment of the bomb site the first two trucks hit an IED and three V8 people in those two vehicles were killed with others seriously wounded soon after I flew by helicopter to the outstation where the green beret turned team was stationed sat with them and told them how incredibly proud I was of their amazing bravery their remarkable work they did night after danger snite it was one of the more emotional moments in my life as we started our meeting silence fell over the room and one of the guys on the team opened by looking me square in the eyes and quietly but resolutely thanking me he knew that the easier decision would have been caving to the pressure from above and deviating from my beliefs and we all knew that would have meant some of the men in this room would have died the green beret had no idea that his words made my throat almost closed as I choked up and how hard I had to fight off tears I was simply overwhelmed by the real life impact by the reality of the situation the overwhelming magnitude of these kind of decisions made under the pressure of intense nightly combat take a toll on people that's difficult to understand for those who haven't experienced it now with the benefit of several years of hindsight and the time to fully reflect on those past events I haven't even even greater belief in the importance of process your own process and a values based decision making process can no exaggeration save people's lives oh he's gonna order someone else to address those I already knew the outcome because I know you're not pushing back for no reason you're pushing back for good reason it might be hard for people to understand that kind of pressure that you're under to kind of concede and just go with what you're being told to do there's times in life you gotta just put it on the table and say be ready for the outcome be ready to be fired you always hear pick your battles this was unquestionably one of them and this is why you are in command and this is why that's is everything that you've trained to do at that point in life is for that it's for a moment like that it's to have confidence in yourself that you're that you're right and to not take that unnecessary risk I still get you know emotional as you were reading it I haven't you know
