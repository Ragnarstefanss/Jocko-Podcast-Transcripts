00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000 This is Jockel Podcast number 74 with echo Charles and me, Jockel Willick. Good evening, I go. Good evening.
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:18.000 Now, I always dug music.
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:29.000 And I'm pretty sure it started when my dad would play Hank Williams' senior on the eight track in his,
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000 I think it was a 1971 barracuda.
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000 And he played that trait that tape just over and over again.
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000 And I still know those songs by heart. And then you know I got that was when I was a little kid.
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000 And then I got a little bit older.
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000 And like a lot of kids, all of a sudden I was listening to the Beatles.
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.000 Sure.
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.000 Elvis.
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.000 Thank you.
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000 Thought they were great.
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000 I still think that song while Mike at Tarjant Lee Weeps is a good song.
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000 But that wore out kind of quickly.
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000 And there was something wasn't there in that music.
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000 Something just wasn't quite there.
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.000 The music didn't sound how I felt.
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:23.000 And then in 1980, A C D C back and black came out.
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000 And it was popular, right? It was just popular.
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000 And so it went into my ears at some point.
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000 And I said,
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000 All right, better.
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.000 Closer.
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.000 Warmer.
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.000 We're getting there.
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000 And then I watched around in the hard rock for a while.
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000 Hendrix.
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000 Led Zeppelin.
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000 And I can't help throwing it on a little jack black when I say that.
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000 If you watch that tribute that he did to them.
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:58.000 And that, you know, some of the kids that I hung around with in New England,
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000 they rode that train down to hippie them.
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000 You know, we're talking, Crosby stills a national Janice Joplin in the Grailful Dead and all that.
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.000 I couldn't relate.
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000 Wasn't there? Didn't get there.
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.000 Didn't seem to reflect the world that I was beginning to see myself.
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000 I got on the other train.
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000 And we're talking about Van Halen.
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000 Yes, this is the 1980s.
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:35.000 You know, if you were a kid in America, age 13, we got issued the album 1984 by Van Halen.
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000 That was just a given you were going to get that.
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000 Got issued diver down.
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.000 Boom, you can use the list of this.
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000 This is rock and roll, people.
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.000 This is Eddie Van Halen.
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000 Listen to that guitar.
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.000 So you're up.
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.000 Listen again.
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.000 You would again.
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000 Iron Maiden.
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000 Right?
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000 Actual song called Trooper.
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000 You know you got to listen to that when you're a kid.
00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000 And so now I'm heading to the right direction.
00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.000 I'm feeling it.
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000 Starting to reflect what things are like in my head.
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:15.000 And then it was that day where I got an album called Black Sabbath by a band called Black Sabbath.
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000 And this first song is also called Black Sabbath.
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.000 And I put that on.
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000 And boom.
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:29.000 I found something that sounded like I was thinking.
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000 And from there, I was definitely on the right train.
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000 Then it was motorhead.
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000 And soon after the Ramones boom.
00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000 And then that leads to the sex pistols.
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000 Because you're just going harder.
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.000 That's what you do.
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.000 That's what I was doing.
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.000 What's a little bit harder than that?
00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.000 What's a little bit harder than that?
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000 Sex pistols.
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.000 Bodies.
00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000 No feelings.
00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.000 They're singing songs.
00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.000 No feelings.
00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.000 Okay.
00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.000 I hear what you're saying.
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.000 louder.
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.000 More anger.
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.000 And then.
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.000 Find me.
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000 We get to Black Flag.
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.000 My war.
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.000 Side two.
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000 Still one of my all time favorites.
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000 Minor threat.
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000 Get a hold of a little band.
00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000 Another little band from DC called the Bad Brains.
00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:23.000 Some Detroit hardcore negative approach.
00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.000 And then.
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000 So I was, you know, I was kind of in the game, right?
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.000 I was there.
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000 And so now 87 rolls around.
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.000 And one of my friends who is actually more of a metal head at this time.
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:45.000 He gives me a cassette tape because this is a darkened dirty when you were just going to have to listen to cassette tapes and they were usually dubbed 47 times from somebody else.
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000 But this was the real tape.
00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.000 And this is the real deal.
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000 This is an actual original with the phone cover on it, everything.
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:59.000 And the cover of this tape was just a giant mushroom cloud of death and destruction.
00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000 And above the mushroom cloud.
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.000 In large, old English script blazing across the top.
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.000 It said.
00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000 Chrome mags.
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000 Okay.
00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000 And then underneath the mushroom cloud.
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000 And a little bit smaller script and old English.
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000 It said the age of coral.
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.000 Okay.
00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000 So I put it in my tape deck.
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.000 Sure.
00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000 And I press play.
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000 And the first track.
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.000 It hit me like a train.
00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000 And it's the first track was called We Got to Know.
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000 And let me just tell you the lyrics.
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000 Struggling in the streets just trying to survive.
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000 Searching for the truth just to keep us alive.
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000 Got to break these shackles.
00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.000 Got to break these chains.
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000 The only way we'll do it is if we use our brains.
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000 There's got to be some meaning to the purpose of life.
00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000 I know there must be more than the struggle and strife.
00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000 I'm not going to be able to do anything for the answers.
00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000 And I need a clue.
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000 But my mind is still disturbed.
00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000 Now what do I do?
00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000 Now I can tell you.
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000 I was not struggling in the streets.
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000 But like most teenage kids.
00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000 I did feel some shackles, right?
00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000 You feel the shackles of things.
00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000 And I was looking for answers.
00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.000 And I needed a clue.
00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000 And so I was like, yeah.
00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.000 We're on to something.
00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000 But I had me a little worried.
00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.000 A little concerned.
00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000 Because like I said, there was a lot of kids who'd taken the hippie route.
00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000 And so I was not into that.
00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000 The next song titled had me a little concerned.
00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000 It was the song was called World Peace.
00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.000 As I was kind of red flag.
00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000 And then I listened to lyrics.
00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:54.000 All you hippies better start to face reality.
00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000 Are you all your far fetched dreams of anarchy?
00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000 Better start to see things.
00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000 The way they are, because the way things are going.
00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000 They won't be going far.
00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000 World peace can't be done.
00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.000 It just can exist.
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000 World peace can't be done.
00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000 Anarchy is a mess.
00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000 Okay.
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:20.000 And the rest of the album kept up that assault on my brain,
00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000 on my attitude.
00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000 And that was it.
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000 I had found something called Hardcore music.
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000 And I never really left it.
00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000 And I listened to Chromeags.
00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000 And a ton of other hardcore bands from that time.
00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:41.000 Until now, and that's pretty much essentially the soundtrack of much of my life.
00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000 And it had a pretty big influence on me.
00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:49.000 And it was an attitude that I kept throughout my life.
00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000 And it was my own interpretation.
00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000 I can tell you that right now.
00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000 It was my own kind of, you know, you listened to the lyrics.
00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000 And you kind of apply what it means in your world.
00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000 That's what I did.
00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000 Which to me was pretty simple.
00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000 Because to me, Hardcore meant Hardcore.
00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.000 That's what it meant.
00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.000 It's pretty simple.
00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.000 Hardcore and everything you do.
00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.000 Work hard.
00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.000 Be aggressive.
00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.000 Don't back down.
00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.000 Fight for what you believe in.
00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.000 Hold the line.
00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000 And that's kind of what I did in my life.
00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000 And I don't know, like a year ago or something.
00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:25.000 Somebody asked me something about, you know, on on the interwebs.
00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.000 Someone said, oh, you know what, what, what, what band should I listen to?
00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000 They know I said, oh, blah, blah, Chromex.
00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000 You know, check them out, whatever.
00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000 And you might want to do that.
00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.000 And eventually, you know, it's the internet is an incredible thing.
00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:48.000 And eventually, I, I, the founding member of the Chromex,
00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000 Guy by the name of Hardly Flanagan.
00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.000 Sure.
00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000 He, like, reached out and said, hey, what's up, man?
00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000 How are you doing?
00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000 And I had heard over the years, you know, that Harley was,
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000 had to jitter, jitter guy, black belt, and jitter.
00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000 And so, you know, he just kind of hit me up.
00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.000 And eventually, you know, we were talking and he said, hey,
00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000 I got a book coming out, it's under two.
00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.000 And I said, cool.
00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000 Yeah, and he said, man, the books crazy.
00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000 And I was kind of like, yeah, you know, yeah, I know, man,
00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.000 because you know, I was around that school.
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.000 I get it.
00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.000 It's kind of crazy.
00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000 And he's like, no, no, no, man, it's, it's crazy.
00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.000 And I said, okay, cool.
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000 So he sent it to me.
00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000 And then I read the book and,
00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:37.000 damn, just, I had, I had no idea.
00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.000 Actually, I had a semblance of an idea, you know,
00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000 because in, in the Hardcore scene,
00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.000 people know each other.
00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000 I mean, like, you know that, you know,
00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000 after I show you, talked to everyone.
00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000 And it's the band members, it's people.
00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:51.000 Everyone kind of knows each other.
00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000 So I had heard stories.
00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.000 But the book, when the reality behind the stories
00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.000 was, was way more intense and crazy than I could
00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.000 of, I thought it was.
00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000 And it was one point when I was reading the book,
00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000 I'm a read a little excerpt right now.
00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:15.000 And it, it said this, this is Hardly.
00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000 When I started working on this book,
00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000 I was staying in a hotel in the Red Light District
00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000 in Amsterdam.
00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:27.000 The working title was the longest suicide
00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000 note ever written.
00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000 I was trying to document the madness
00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.000 from as far back as I could remember until the end.
00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000 The story of my life,
00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.000 as an insane, suicidal, joy-ride
00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000 of rock and roll, the prairie,
00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.000 and demise until the final crash in burn.
00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000 It was going to be a book that all the great fuckups
00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000 never got to write because they died first.
00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000 So I began working on it.
00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:03.000 I figured the end would have come sooner than later.
00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000 But I was wrong.
00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.000 And once I got done reading the book,
00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000 I reached out to Hardly and I said, hey man,
00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.000 there's a lot in this book that's crazy.
00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000 And the fact that you live through it,
00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.000 and the fact that you got through it,
00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000 and the fact that you got to the position that you're in now
00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000 with your life, I think a lot of people can learn from it
00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000 and to be awesome if you come onto the podcast.
00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000 And Hardly said, let's do it.
00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:37.000 So Hardly Flanagan, welcome to the show, man.
00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000 It's great to be here.
00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000 Thank you for having me on.
00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.000 Yeah, it's awesome.
00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.000 And I saw you several times when I was a kid,
00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000 and we were trying to figure out names of clubs where I saw you.
00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:54.000 But that was pretty cool and it's pretty cool to be sitting here.
00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000 I guess we're talking about 30 years later.
00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000 You know, I was seeing you when I was in my teens,
00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000 14, 13, 15 around there.
00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000 And here we are.
00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000 Pretty amazing trip we've had since died.
00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:09.000 Yeah.
00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000 And usually I, when I ask people,
00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000 you know, talk about where you come from,
00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000 quickly and kind of where you grew up,
00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.000 and we don't spend a lot of time there,
00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000 because most people didn't really do anything significant
00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000 that had any long term impact on their lives.
00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000 When they're like, eight, nine, ten years old, right?
00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000 But for you,
00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.000 I mean, when you were eight, nine, ten years old,
00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000 shit was already crazy.
00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:33.000 Yeah, yeah.
00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000 She was pretty much crazy from the start.
00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.000 Yeah.
00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:42.000 I'm going to just kind of pull a little something here out of the book,
00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000 just to give a little bit of background.
00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.000 This is from Harley's book Hardcore Life of My Own.
00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:54.000 I was born at San Francisco General Hospital on March 8, 1967
00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000 at the start of the summer of love.
00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:02.000 My mom's name is Rose Marie Foulou, Fellou.
00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.000 And my dad's name was Harley Wayne Walker,
00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:07.000 Flanagan.
00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:08.000 My mom was a hippie.
00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000 My dad was a drifter,
00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000 and somehow their paths crossed.
00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000 Before the hippie days,
00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.000 my mom was into all the early rock and roll stuff,
00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.000 Motown, and pretty much all the music that was happening when she was young.
00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000 Her father, Juan Fellou?
00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.000 Yes, Juan Fellou.
00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.000 Juan Fellou came from the DR, the Dominican Republic,
00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:33.000 came to America through Ellis Island by himself.
00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:34.000 When he was in his early teens,
00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000 and one of the first, was one of the first
00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000 to medications to join the United States Army,
00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:39.000 served in World War II,
00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000 where he played in the military band.
00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000 That's how he got his citizenship by serving in the military.
00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000 He was one of the funniest people I ever knew.
00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000 He worked all kinds of different jobs,
00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000 everything from building a building super,
00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000 to a long storm, and he was a charming guy with a thick,
00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000 Spanish accent.
00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:59.000 So that's the beginnings.
00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000 Did you speak any Spanish?
00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000 I curse a little bit, that's not it.
00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.000 So you got that?
00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:06.000 Yeah, yeah.
00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000 Now you continue on my mom,
00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000 was a go-go dancer.
00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:12.000 And like so many people,
00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.000 she was caught up in the whole drug culture of the 60s.
00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000 And when I was a kid,
00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:19.000 she was still a stripper.
00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000 I remember going to work with her a few times,
00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.000 and I was little.
00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.000 That was weird,
00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000 looking back on it now.
00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000 There was even a short period of time
00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000 when she was a dominatrix,
00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000 but that was later.
00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:37.000 My dad left home for good around the same age as me.
00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000 Maybe 14 or 15 and started writing freight trains.
00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000 He liked to live for a moment to moment.
00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000 And from everything I've heard,
00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000 he had a serious drug and alcohol issues
00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.000 most of his life.
00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000 He was always in and out of prison.
00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000 It's hard to accept that your dad chose
00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000 heroin and alcohol over you.
00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.000 It really does kind of hurt even now.
00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000 I guess that might be one of the reasons
00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000 why I turned out the way I did.
00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000 My mom and me did a lot of hitchhiking
00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000 and stayed with a lot of different people.
00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000 A lot of crazy shit happened on those trips.
00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000 At one point, a friend of hers was going to Europe
00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:17.000 and asked,
00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000 do you want to come? And my mom was like,
00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000 I'm getting the fuck out of here.
00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000 She did and I went with her.
00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000 I was probably around three or four.
00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:27.000 That was that.
00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000 I never saw my father again.
00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000 I stayed in Europe pretty much until I was about 10,
00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000 but I come back to the States every year or so.
00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000 We settled down in Denmark,
00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000 1971.
00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:47.000 Denmark and Danish culture are very wholesome.
00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000 It's a great place to grow up.
00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000 But of course, there's an underside too.
00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:56.000 In the 60s and in my case, the late 60s and 70s,
00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:00.000 it was cool and certain aspects and wasn't so cool in others.
00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000 You had all these people fucked up on drugs
00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000 and all the free love.
00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:06.000 Everybody's fucking everybody.
00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.000 And it's not really the best environment for a kid to grow up in.
00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000 And it's cool as some of the things and a lot of the people were,
00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.000 a lot of them were at least some of them.
00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.000 We're just fucking lost.
00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000 And yeah, all the kids were wild.
00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:22.000 What do you expect?
00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.000 I mean, we were just in imitating the grownups.
00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000 So as a result, I was getting late
00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:31.000 and doing all kinds of other crazy ship before I even reached puberty.
00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.000 You basically had a lot of little kids just going off.
00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.000 You got all these hippy kids with their hippy parents,
00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.000 seeing all kinds of crazyness of adults running around naked.
00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000 People doing drugs, being insane.
00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.000 That shit rubbs off on kids.
00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:46.000 Damn.
00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000 Yeah.
00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.000 Did you completely think that was normal at the time?
00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000 Was that just the way the world was?
00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000 That's the way my world was.
00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:03.000 I didn't realize really that we were so different from the world.
00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:11.000 I was different from the rest of society until my parents tried to put me into a regular school.
00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:15.000 And of course, I started getting fucked with a lot by the kids
00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:20.000 because I had long hair and I didn't really fit in.
00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.000 And my parents looked like freaks.
00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000 And that was when it really hit me.
00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000 And it was also, I went from being at that hippy school
00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000 to being in a very strict school in Denmark,
00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.000 which was like real old school and very rigid.
00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.000 So it was total culture shock,
00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000 and it was like what the fuck?
00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:40.000 And so I started cutting school a lot and going back to the free school
00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000 to visit all my friends there and just hang out.
00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:46.000 And that's where you started playing?
00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:47.000 Pretty much.
00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.000 You know, I mean, I was always in music.
00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:52.000 That was really the first place that facilitated it.
00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.000 You know, like they, that was one of the cool things about that school
00:17:55.000 --> 00:18:00.000 was they really pushed the arts.
00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:04.000 You know, they, whatever the kids interests were,
00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:08.000 they would give you the ability to pursue that.
00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.000 Unfortunately, they were also very lack.
00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:14.000 So if like you didn't have the interest in pursuing math,
00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.000 or whatever, they'd be like, oh, well, you know,
00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.000 he's just not interested in it.
00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:19.000 You know, he wants to be a musician.
00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.000 And it's like, you know, as we all know as parents
00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:26.000 is like, no, fuck that, you need to know how to do your math.
00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:27.000 You need to know your shit.
00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.000 You need to have, you not use your brain.
00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:33.000 You know, it's not just about, you know, gratifying your artistic
00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:37.000 and creative interests because that's not going to always pay your fucking bills.
00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:38.000 Yeah.
00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.000 So, no, but it was cool.
00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:43.000 It was cool in certain ways, like I said, you know,
00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:48.000 they, my math teacher, he was actually from the States.
00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:49.000 He was from the Bronx.
00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:54.000 And he was a jazz drummer and played stand-up bass.
00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:58.000 And he really was a big inspiration on me musically.
00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:01.000 So, you know, it gave me some tools.
00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.000 You know, that came in handy later in life.
00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.000 Yeah, for sure.
00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:11.000 So, you were listening to, actually got your first gig then,
00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:15.000 like, like, you were playing little Santana covers.
00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:16.000 Yeah.
00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:17.000 Cool in the gang covers.
00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:18.000 That was my school band.
00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.000 Yeah, my school band was cool.
00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.000 They were like, yeah, yeah, no, they were fucking legit.
00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.000 I mean, we were like, you know, funky stuff, you know,
00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.000 I mean, we were playing, like I said,
00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.000 my math teacher, he was one of the band leaders.
00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.000 So, you know, you got a guy from the Bronx who's a jazz dude.
00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.000 He's going to be teaching all these little Danish kids musically.
00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:36.000 What's really going on?
00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:37.000 Right.
00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.000 Because in Denmark at the time, things like, you know, Abba,
00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.000 Oh, his voice was big.
00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:44.000 You know, so, you know, I mean, so it was like, what the fuck?
00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:49.000 You know, so yeah, my school was cool as far as music and counter culture
00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:50.000 and all that shit.
00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:55.000 But then, you know, then, well, as you may have seen in the book,
00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:59.000 really, then when my mother of all people turned me on to the sex pistols,
00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:03.000 that's what really got that changed everything.
00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:08.000 You know, that was an eye.
00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:09.000 Oh, yeah.
00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:09.000 Yeah.
00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:10.000 The sex pistols.
00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:11.000 Oh, yeah.
00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:12.000 Yeah.
00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:13.000 It changed everything for me.
00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:16.000 And at that time, like, you got one section here where you said,
00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.000 I remember coming off stage, you were playing with the band.
00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:21.000 I think the school band at this point, I remember coming off stage
00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:22.000 one night, these girls.
00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:26.000 No, yeah, yeah, but I was hanging out with, they were like, you know,
00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.000 that lady you came with, which was her mom.
00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:31.000 She's in the bathroom. She's not feeling too good.
00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:34.000 I went in the bathroom and my mom was throwing up all over the place.
00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:37.000 That kind of shit was a kind of come down.
00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:37.000 Yeah.
00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.000 Back to reality.
00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:40.000 That's the mom home.
00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:41.000 Yeah.
00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:42.000 Yeah.
00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:45.000 It's fucked up, you know, little things like that.
00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:46.000 They stay with you forever.
00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:49.000 But, you know, to her,
00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:53.000 she did sober up eventually.
00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:56.000 And, you know, she's sobered up for about,
00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:00.000 in the 80s, the day she died, she was cleaning.
00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.000 You know,
00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:07.000 yeah, you know, people fall victim to drugs to alcohol.
00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:10.000 And sometimes it's hard to pull yourself out.
00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.000 You know, but eventually she did, you know,
00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.000 unfortunately I had to witness a lot of real,
00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.000 ridiculous shit, but,
00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:20.000 you know,
00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:23.000 I don't think there's such a thing as a perfect parent, you know.
00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.000 No, no doubt about that.
00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:31.000 And your mom, she did, like you said,
00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.000 she gets you this sex pistols out.
00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:33.000 Yeah.
00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.000 And like you said in here, you said,
00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:36.000 well, that was that.
00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:37.000 Yeah.
00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:38.000 Yeah.
00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.000 And it's almost,
00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.000 Kansas, what I was saying here we go,
00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:43.000 go into your book here.
00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:44.000 Until that point,
00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:46.000 I hung around with all these little hippie kids.
00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:47.000 I had long ass hair,
00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.000 so we were really already little freaks.
00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:50.000 We'd walk around the streets.
00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.000 People would give us looks and trip out on us.
00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:56.000 Our parents and teachers had long hair and beard and shit like that.
00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:59.000 But then punk rock came about.
00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:01.000 And this was more appropriate for me.
00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.000 It wasn't all peace and love.
00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:04.000 It was just more me.
00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:09.000 The music was raw and the imagery and the craziness appealed to me.
00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:13.000 It was energetic and a big factor for me was
00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:16.000 you didn't have to aspire to be Jimmy Hendrix.
00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:17.000 You didn't have to be Carlos Santana.
00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:19.000 So you listen to that music and you'd say,
00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:20.000 you know what?
00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:21.000 I can just play it.
00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:22.000 I can do this.
00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:23.000 You can play that.
00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:24.000 I can do this.
00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:26.000 I can have fun and do this shit.
00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.000 Like this is, you know,
00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:30.000 you don't need to rack your brain to figure out how to do this.
00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:32.000 You could just do it.
00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:33.000 You know,
00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:34.000 You're power of horror.
00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:34.000 Fuck it.
00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:35.000 Yeah, man.
00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:36.000 You know, it's like,
00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.000 you just need some serity, man.
00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:39.000 That's all you need, man.
00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:40.000 That's all you fucking need.
00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:41.000 It was funny.
00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:44.000 I always tell people this about music.
00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:48.000 If you go to a guitar store anywhere in America
00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:51.000 and you put up a little flyer in there that says,
00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:56.000 you know, I need someone that can play every note on the following three albums.
00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:59.000 You know, and you pick a complex, you pick rush and cart and they're,
00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:02.000 and they'll be, you'll get 10 people that'll say,
00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:03.000 yeah, I can play all that stuff.
00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:05.000 I'll play it for you right now.
00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:07.000 But there's,
00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:09.000 and all those guys, I mean, a lot of those guys,
00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:13.000 unless they have that thing, unless they have that sincerity that you're talking about,
00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:15.000 and they have that little spark of creativity.
00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.000 It doesn't matter how technically you are,
00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:18.000 if you don't have that heart.
00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:22.000 You could be technically amazing and have not won
00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:26.000 ounce of inspiration in your fucking body.
00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:29.000 You know, and I mean, look, man,
00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:32.000 you know, the Ramones were, you know,
00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:35.000 some of the worst greatest musicians ever.
00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:37.000 You know, those guys could barely fucking play
00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:40.000 and they wrote some, they wrote songs that are still anthems.
00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:43.000 You know, songs that you will still hear played at like major sports,
00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:45.000 arenas or whatever.
00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:50.000 I mean, you know, yeah, you know, music's a fucking weird thing, man.
00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.000 That is, it is.
00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:57.000 And you had your first band called Little Big Boss.
00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:58.000 Is that in reference to you?
00:23:58.000 --> 00:23:59.000 I mean, you know what?
00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:01.000 Since you've been here a whole, you know,
00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:04.000 it must have been because the other two guys in the band were adults,
00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:05.000 and they named the band.
00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:08.000 So looking back, they probably named it after me,
00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:10.000 because I was like, I guess already,
00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:13.000 a tyrant to play with, but you know,
00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:15.000 and you were playing drums at that time?
00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:16.000 Yeah, yeah.
00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:17.000 Hammering all the drums.
00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.000 And then you guys move back to,
00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:21.000 back to New York.
00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.000 Yeah, and you're going back and forth back to New York.
00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.000 Yeah, I mean, my mom, we lived in Europe,
00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:30.000 but we would come back every year or year and a half or so
00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:33.000 to see my grandparents and my aunts and stuff.
00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:36.000 And so we always had that connection to New York.
00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.000 We always came back and I, you know,
00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:43.000 and I was here during all, like, the pivotal moments in history in New York.
00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:45.000 Like, you know, I remember it's on a Sam,
00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.000 which was huge if you were here.
00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:48.000 You know, I remember the blackouts,
00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:50.000 which were also huge if you hear,
00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:52.000 I remember the garbage strike,
00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:54.000 which was also insane because you had like,
00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:58.000 20 foot mountains of garbage every fucking way.
00:24:58.000 --> 00:24:59.000 I mean, the city's stink.
00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:01.000 I mean, you know, like,
00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:04.000 I remember all the madness of New York.
00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:07.000 I mean, I moved back here for good in 79,
00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:10.000 like, I guess, January or February of 79.
00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:12.000 It was like the weeks it died.
00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:15.000 Actually, the stimulators were supposed to play
00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:20.000 maxes the one weekend that he was playing any died before the show.
00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:23.000 But, um, yeah, you know,
00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:26.000 it was a much different place back then, you know,
00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:27.000 you guys know, you know,
00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:30.000 but a, you know, a lot of people who have only been here over the last 20.
00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:33.000 Years, they have no clue.
00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:34.000 Yeah, no.
00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:35.000 It is a different place.
00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:37.000 And I mean, you know, in the book,
00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:42.000 you got crazy pictures like you and Andy Warhol.
00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:43.000 Yeah.
00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:45.000 Because you were just your,
00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:48.000 it was your aunt Denise that was running with that.
00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:51.000 Well, no, actually, he, that was just a random moment.
00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:53.000 My mom actually knew him.
00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:56.000 She had been in one of his movies when she was young,
00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:58.000 when she was like 15 or something.
00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:02.000 And that picture was just taken at the class show.
00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:06.000 Like I used to run into people like him at different clubs and stuff.
00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:09.000 This was backstage at a class gig first time they played.
00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:11.000 You look like you're about 10.
00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:14.000 I was actually 12 in that picture.
00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:16.000 But yeah, I mean,
00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:18.000 I was at all the clubs all the time.
00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:21.000 You know, I mean, it was actually,
00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:23.000 it was, you know, kind of weird.
00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:25.000 You know, thinking back on it because like,
00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:27.000 I mean, when I, when I did a video,
00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:29.000 I did a thing with Anthony board day and a while back.
00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:31.000 And he was like, you know, he, he's like,
00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:35.000 I remember standing front of clubs like Max is and trying to get in.
00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:37.000 And you know, here come this like 12 year old kid.
00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:40.000 Just like walk through the fucking door.
00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.000 Like the bounce was just like let him in.
00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.000 Like, you know, like he belonged in there and I'm like,
00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:45.000 who the fuck?
00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:47.000 And why the fuck is this child here?
00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:49.000 Like who let him in and who the fuck is he?
00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:50.000 And why are they serving him?
00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:52.000 Like he's the fucking mayor.
00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:54.000 You know, you know,
00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:59.000 thinking back it is, yeah, it's fucking a little strange.
00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:02.000 You know, I mean, I was, I was the youngest kid that you
00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.000 around on the club scene back then.
00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:08.000 And then, you know, as time went on,
00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.000 you know, my band, the stimulator,
00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:12.000 it was really, had a lot to do with it.
00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:15.000 The crowds at the show started getting younger.
00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.000 And younger because like, you know,
00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:19.000 we started pulling a very young following,
00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:22.000 you know, go figure 12 year old in the band.
00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:25.000 And people like the Beastie Boys,
00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:28.000 they started coming to see it before they were the Beastie Boys.
00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:30.000 They were like, they were just fans of ours,
00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:31.000 friends of mine.
00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:33.000 They were like some of my best friends growing up.
00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:37.000 And then a lot of other people who went on to
00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:42.000 start a lot of the first wave of New York hardcore bands
00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:44.000 were fans of the stimulators.
00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:46.000 Kids were all like, you know,
00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:49.000 and they really teens when they used to see us play.
00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:51.000 And then they went on to start a lot of the bands that
00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:54.000 they had, you know, set off that.
00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:57.000 How long did you play with the stimulator for?
00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:03.000 I had only played with them from like 79 to like 80.
00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:05.000 Maybe the beginning of 81.
00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:07.000 And then I was done with it because at that point,
00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.000 I had already, you know,
00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:12.000 the bad brains had come to New York and I was already.
00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:15.000 And I was, all that first hardcore that came out from,
00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:17.000 you know, black flagged a circle jerks,
00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:20.000 minor threat and of course bands like this charge
00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.000 from over see from England, you know,
00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:28.000 and all that shit was starting to really take over my,
00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:31.000 my, my soul.
00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:33.000 And so I was like, you know,
00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:35.000 I can't play with the fucking stimulator anymore.
00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:36.000 It should as to poppy.
00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:38.000 It's to like, it's happy.
00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:40.000 It's just not, it's not where I am.
00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:43.000 And at that point, I had already, you know,
00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:47.000 the life I was living on the streets and the wife that,
00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:51.000 you know, the other band members were living was not really the same.
00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:53.000 I was just hitting my teens.
00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:56.000 And as we all know,
00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.000 that's when the problem was became,
00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:01.000 you know, that's when you start getting in trouble.
00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:03.000 So yeah.
00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:07.000 And the music that I started writing really reflected the,
00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:12.000 the feelings that I was having.
00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:15.000 You know, the, because of the,
00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:17.000 not just the environment, but just, you know,
00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:20.000 everything leading up to that point had,
00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:22.000 had created this person.
00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:24.000 And, and it was a really violent neighborhood.
00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.000 You know, it was a really violent neighborhood.
00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.000 And I ate a lot of shit for being white.
00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:31.000 And, um, which is ironic because, you know,
00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.000 I'm quarter Dominican and I'm Cherokee and I'm Chakhtow.
00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:35.000 But if you look at me, especially, you know,
00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:38.000 you know, all Puerto Rican neighborhood, I'm a white boy.
00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:40.000 You know, so I really ate a lot of shit.
00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:44.000 I really, you know, until I started fighting.
00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:47.000 And actually, started getting more,
00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:50.000 I hate to say it, but it started getting more violent.
00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:53.000 That started to earn me a little bit of respect.
00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:59.000 And, uh, I guess the fear and the credibility kind of went hand in hand,
00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:02.000 like when people knew that they couldn't fuck with me.
00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:04.000 I started getting respect.
00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:09.000 And, um, I don't really think that's a really healthy,
00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:19.000 for a young mind to associate popularity with violence and aggression.
00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:20.000 You know.
00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:21.000 Yeah.
00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:23.000 And I mean, New York at that time.
00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:27.000 And like you said, and I used to come down to New York sometimes when I was younger.
00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:29.000 And it was completely different.
00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:33.000 You know, in the mid 80s, on you were there earlier than that.
00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:35.000 But for me, in the mid 80s, when you'd come down here,
00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:36.000 it was completely different.
00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.000 I mean, we're sitting here right now in Times Square.
00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:40.000 Times Square was fucking nuts around you.
00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:41.000 It was not man.
00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:43.000 There was like, you take two, every two steps.
00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:45.000 Somebody be off and you drugs.
00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:49.000 You know, I used to come here when I'd cut school and just watch people get pickpocketed.
00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:54.000 Watch the hookers, turn in tricks and the guy is selling drugs and the people getting into trouble.
00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:55.000 Yeah.
00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:59.000 It was, it was a fucking free for all of us.
00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:00.000 Really?
00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:02.000 And where you were living, you were living.
00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:03.000 Yeah, it was just dangerous.
00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:04.000 It was dangerous.
00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:05.000 It was way worse.
00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:07.000 I mean, I was talking to, Iced, the other day we were talking about.
00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:12.000 You know, some of our experiences and just in my area alone, I mean,
00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:16.000 there was about five or six gangs within a, you know, ten,
00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.000 fifteen block.
00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:22.000 Distance, you know, everything from the hitmen on my block were,
00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:27.000 were fucking really out of control to the Hell's Angels on third street,
00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:32.000 who back then were legitimately no fucking joke.
00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:36.000 I mean, you know, I mean, I could tell you some fucked up.
00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:40.000 Stories, but you know, you can tell me fucked up stories.
00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:48.000 So it's just, it's hard to, you know, it's hard to, if people go to New York now,
00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.000 it's just completely different.
00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:51.000 Yeah, it really is.
00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:54.000 It's, it's impossible to really get it.
00:31:54.000 --> 00:32:00.000 I mean, the best thing you could do is look at like some old movies that kind of try to capture the,
00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:03.000 then you got some pictures in the book that show the neighborhoods.
00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:04.000 Yeah.
00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:07.000 And there, you can tell, you can tell they look like a war zone.
00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:08.000 Yeah.
00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:11.000 I mean, I wouldn't know, but they look as close to one of the things.
00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:12.000 They look like a war zone.
00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:14.000 You can take it from me or that one.
00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:17.000 I mean, I mean, dude, I was living in a squat.
00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:20.000 We literally had no running water, no windows, no doors.
00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:22.000 What's the, how old were you when you like moved out?
00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:26.000 I was like, I was told when I was like 14, you know,
00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:30.000 because basically I was getting into so much trouble in school that they were about to,
00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:34.000 basically take me from my mother and put me in like spotford.
00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:37.000 And I was like, fuck this.
00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:41.000 You know, I had lost interest in school and all that shit.
00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:42.000 It's actually funny.
00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:44.000 I was something I wanted to tell you.
00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:47.000 When I was 15, actually just right down there,
00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:51.000 there was a recruiting center of Army Marines, Navy the whole bit.
00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:53.000 And I was 15.
00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:58.000 I tried to enlist in the Marines, you know, because like at that point,
00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:02.000 I was already, I was very, I guess I had a lot of pent-up aggression.
00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:06.000 You know, and I was just like, you know, I just want to fucking, you know,
00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:08.000 I probably shouldn't say this and probably sounds bad for the military,
00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:10.000 but I just wanted to kill.
00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:16.000 I just wanted to fucking kill and I wanted to be able to, like,
00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:19.000 I just was so fucking, you know,
00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:22.000 and it didn't help that my mother was a hippie.
00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:26.000 So, you know, just it's natural for a teenager to rebel against everything their parents believe in.
00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:30.000 I mean, I had like fucking recruiting, you know, catalogs and shit under my bed,
00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:34.000 whereas most kids probably had, you know, their playboys and shit, like my mom would find my
00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:37.000 rugby, I don't know, their recruiting shit, like what is this?
00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:40.000 You know, instead of like holding up the fucking, you know, pent-ups,
00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:41.000 what did he do?
00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:44.000 He's like, I had him raised by a son to beat no soldier.
00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:46.000 Get out of fucking hippie fucking.
00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:49.000 There's a lot of guys in the military.
00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:51.000 You know, I like fuck this.
00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:53.000 Through the years, you're a hundred percent right, because through the years,
00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:56.000 there's so many guys in the military and you meet some guy and you're like, hey,
00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:57.000 how's it going?
00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:59.000 You know, you learn their last name at first, but then you know,
00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:02.000 you get to know him a little bit and you're like, you know,
00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:03.000 what's your first name?
00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:06.000 And they'll be like, oh, my first name is Rainbow.
00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:09.000 You know, my first name is, you know, Ocean.
00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:12.000 And then they go, yeah, my parents were happy, you know.
00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:15.000 And so many kids rebel against the hippie parents.
00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:17.000 I'm going to be a horrible man.
00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:20.000 I'm going to the in the sea with these.
00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:21.000 That's very common.
00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:23.000 So you're a hundred percent right.
00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:24.000 It's a good way to rebel.
00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:26.000 And I even say this, you know, for me, you know,
00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:28.000 hardcore was a rebellion.
00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:29.000 No, yeah.
00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:33.000 And going in the military for it was a rebellion against the the norm.
00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:35.000 You know, was everyone's going to a,
00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:40.000 go be a hippie, smoked dope, go to college, get a job.
00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:43.000 And I was like, no, I'm going to go be a commando and just get after it.
00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:44.000 Fuck you know.
00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:45.000 Yeah, dude.
00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:48.000 So you know what, it's fucked up because it's like,
00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:52.000 had I followed those instincts, you know.
00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:57.000 I mean, you know, and some ways my life would have been probably a million times better.
00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:01.000 I know what it had a lot more, you know,
00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:03.000 discipline.
00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:04.000 I would have had a lot more focus.
00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:07.000 I would have had more positive of a ship, you know, going on.
00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:10.000 I would have learned some of skills in shit, but at the same time,
00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:12.000 I wouldn't have fucking written age of quarrel.
00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:13.000 I wouldn't have written best wishes.
00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:17.000 I wouldn't have influenced people like you to be, you know,
00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:21.000 to go above and beyond what the fuck I could ever fucking try to do.
00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:24.000 You know, so it's like I feel like in my own way,
00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:30.000 I managed to do my service to, you know, humanity.
00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:34.000 If you will, you know, although it was a disservice in a lot of ways
00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:38.000 because I did inspire a lot of people to do a lot of really fucking wrong shit, you know.
00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:43.000 But, but nonetheless, the inspiration that it was real, it was genuine.
00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:46.000 I think that's why I 30 years later, people still give a fuck about that record.
00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:50.000 And people still out making money on that record.
00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:54.000 And, you know, people still cover songs off that record.
00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:57.000 You know, and it's funny because I was telling you earlier.
00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:59.000 I mean, that line-up that played on that record.
00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:02.000 Only lasted for one fucking record.
00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:05.000 You know, it's amazing how short-term it's a lot.
00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:06.000 Yeah, sure.
00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:07.000 Yeah.
00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:10.000 And it's like, and you know, it was something special because still now,
00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:12.000 30 years later, people still talking about it.
00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:15.000 And not many people can say that based on one fucking album.
00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:16.000 Yeah.
00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:19.000 You know, so, that's good shit.
00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:20.000 I got it.
00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:26.000 I'm just going to go like, I'm talking about your neighborhood.
00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:33.000 This is just kind of a sample of what you were living around and in.
00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:34.000 Back to the book.
00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:39.000 I remember one night lying there hearing some check down the street getting raped.
00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:42.000 And knowing there was really nothing to do.
00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:44.000 It was like a helpless feeling.
00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:48.000 You knew that if the cops got called, it wouldn't matter because they probably wouldn't show up.
00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:52.000 And if they did, it would be too late and they probably wouldn't find her.
00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:53.000 Yeah.
00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:57.000 One night, my mother's then boyfriend got the tip of his nose almost shot off by a zip gun.
00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:59.000 He has a scar to this day.
00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:04.000 Just because he was white, looked a little freaky and was walking down our block.
00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:07.000 I remember coming home one night in my aunt.
00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:11.000 And my aunt, my aunt and and Gustafson, the stimulators base,
00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:16.000 has jumped by six dudes with golf clubs and shit trying to pull her guitar out of her hands.
00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:20.000 You don't really think about a group of guys jumping two chicks in a kid,
00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:21.000 but that shit happened.
00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:23.000 They didn't give a fuck.
00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:27.000 You've got to figure a lot of these guys would hang out and huff glue and shit.
00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:34.000 And when you huff glue and you smoke a lot of dust, you get pretty grim and lean towards the violence.
00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:35.000 Yeah.
00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:39.000 So there's your surroundings, there's your environment.
00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:40.000 Yeah.
00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:47.000 I mean, it's, you know, it's, I'll tell you, man, it's, it's, uh,
00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:52.000 it's almost harder to hear it being read back to me now,
00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:58.000 especially in your voice, but, but it's like, you know, it's real.
00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:07.000 And it, it brings back a, a serious emotional response at me, you know.
00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:11.000 You know, as I was reading that, I was just thinking of myself because you and I, you know, in the scene,
00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:17.000 there was always guys that had dogs, right in pit bulls, everyone had pit bulls.
00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:22.000 And as I was reading that, you know, you and I both know, if you take a pit bull,
00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:26.000 and you bring it up and you beat it and you torture it and you heard it,
00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:30.000 that dog's going to be a mean evil bastard.
00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:36.000 And if that dog's brother can get brought up and get fed and get taken care of and, you know,
00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:40.000 sleep and get treated good and that dog's and grow up, I mean, I said, you know,
00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:48.000 I just think and you take a person, a human being and you put them in an environment where that's what they're living with and that's what they're seeing and that's what's around them.
00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:50.000 They're going to tend towards that direction.
00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:53.000 Yeah. And it's going to be hard to break out of that shit.
00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:57.000 It is, you know, and it's, you know, look around at the world, man.
00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:05.000 You know, look at all the, all the fucking getos everywhere. Look at all the, you know, all the, you know,
00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:09.000 a lot of people don't get outside of this country, you know, they live here.
00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:18.000 So if people don't realize how well they have it, you know, and even, you know, I used to laugh.
00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:26.000 I was talking to my friend, Meli Mel and we were saying, I was saying, you know, I don't even understand what the fuck's up with all that,
00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:32.000 like Wes Kowe's gang banging shit. I mean, these guys, they, first of all, they don't even have to deal with winter.
00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:41.000 They, you know, second fall. They all got like yards and garages and fucking barbecues and shit.
00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:49.000 Like we grew up in like apartments with fucking rats and roaches and, you know, concrete everywhere.
00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:56.000 Yeah. And, you know, what the fuck you so pissed about that you need to go and shoot at each other and kill each other. You have fucking bored.
00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:05.000 Like it's just, you know, it is an interesting dynamic here in New York City, the way it is.
00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:13.000 Yeah, it's very, it's, it's, I mean, even now that it's like, you know, soft as fucking baby shit, it's still in touch.
00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:22.000 Yeah, you know, I like, I, I just, I feel confined when I'm here, you know, now, now that I've grown up when I come here,
00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:26.000 I living cow, I live a cow for you. Yeah. And you're right. I got a yards.
00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:34.000 And I got a barbecues. And, and my neighbors have yards. And they say good morning.
00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:38.000 Yeah, you know, it's going up. And it's, it's like you just, you have space, yeah.
00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:43.000 Yeah, it's a real thing. And animals, you know, you can't put animal in little tiny cage. They get pissed off.
00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:48.000 Yeah. That's what we do with 8 million people in New York put him in little tiny cages, but it's hard getting pissed off.
00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:49.000 It's tough.
00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:55.000 Especially when the good majority of them are broke a shit.
00:40:55.000 --> 00:41:01.72 But this whole time, as you're doing this, at the same time, you're still listening
00:41:01.72 --> 00:41:04.96 to music, you're going to show us all the time.
00:41:04.96 --> 00:41:07.72 Like you said, the bad brain show up.
00:41:07.72 --> 00:41:08.72 Yeah.
00:41:08.72 --> 00:41:09.72 That was a change.
00:41:09.72 --> 00:41:10.72 That was a game changer.
00:41:10.72 --> 00:41:15.64 They were as groundbreaking as far as for me.
00:41:15.64 --> 00:41:18.84 They rocked in my world as much as the sex pistols.
00:41:18.84 --> 00:41:21.24 Like it was like all of a sudden it was a new chapter.
00:41:21.24 --> 00:41:24.04 I, you know, the way you wrote about the bad brain.
00:41:24.04 --> 00:41:29.56 So the bad brains for those of you that don't know is a band from DC and they were pivotal
00:41:29.56 --> 00:41:33.04 in changing music, really, generation of music.
00:41:33.04 --> 00:41:36.64 And there's all kinds of bands that reference them, like big bands that reference the
00:41:36.64 --> 00:41:37.64 bad brains.
00:41:37.64 --> 00:41:38.64 But here's what you said about the bad brains.
00:41:38.64 --> 00:41:39.64 That's one thing.
00:41:39.64 --> 00:41:40.64 Yeah.
00:41:40.64 --> 00:41:45.56 But this is for those who don't know, they were not only one of the innovators of
00:41:45.56 --> 00:41:49.60 what we call hardcore punk, but they were all black.
00:41:49.60 --> 00:41:51.32 And they were from DC.
00:41:51.32 --> 00:41:55.72 And you know, there was not many black kids on the scene.
00:41:55.72 --> 00:41:57.36 There always was black kids on the scene.
00:41:57.36 --> 00:41:58.36 There was always Puerto Rican.
00:41:58.36 --> 00:41:59.36 It was always everybody.
00:41:59.36 --> 00:42:02.08 You know, we always, it was always mixed diversity on the scene.
00:42:02.08 --> 00:42:05.48 But they were like the best.
00:42:05.48 --> 00:42:06.48 They were the tightest.
00:42:06.48 --> 00:42:07.48 They were the best.
00:42:07.48 --> 00:42:10.56 They were the fucking, they were the shit man.
00:42:10.56 --> 00:42:14.96 And a lot of times when people first heard their first 45, you know, just because of the
00:42:14.96 --> 00:42:18.16 style of the music, people didn't even know they were black.
00:42:18.16 --> 00:42:19.16 And they'd go see them.
00:42:19.16 --> 00:42:20.44 They'd be like, oh shit, these guys are black.
00:42:20.44 --> 00:42:22.44 Now that may not seem like a big deal now.
00:42:22.44 --> 00:42:26.40 But we're talking about fucking, you know, 80.
00:42:26.40 --> 00:42:29.72 You know, and yeah, they were just the fucking, they were the shit man.
00:42:29.72 --> 00:42:31.36 And then they got into rostophionism.
00:42:31.36 --> 00:42:34.16 And that, you know, even further made it even more bizarre.
00:42:34.16 --> 00:42:37.52 A bunch of fucking rostos from DC playing hardcore.
00:42:37.52 --> 00:42:39.52 Yeah, you know, with the fuckers dad.
00:42:39.52 --> 00:42:43.40 And playing it better than everybody, like fucking smoking motherfucking.
00:42:43.40 --> 00:42:44.40 Yeah.
00:42:44.40 --> 00:42:50.28 You know, you know, I think if you got to see the bad brands back in the day, you're
00:42:50.28 --> 00:42:51.28 lucky.
00:42:51.28 --> 00:42:55.32 And I mean, I remember seeing the bad brands and just being.
00:42:55.32 --> 00:43:00.20 You just, just, I mean, it'd be like seeing James Brown back when he had Bootsie Collins
00:43:00.20 --> 00:43:04.20 on base, like back in the old, like when he was like all over the, I always used to like
00:43:04.20 --> 00:43:07.16 in HR to like James Brown meets Johnny Rotten.
00:43:07.16 --> 00:43:08.16 Yeah.
00:43:08.16 --> 00:43:09.60 You know, here's what you said.
00:43:09.60 --> 00:43:11.000 Back to the book.
00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:16.40 You hear a lot of crazy stories about HR. HR is the, the singer from the bad brands.
00:43:16.40 --> 00:43:19.32 Throat in the bad brands.
00:43:19.32 --> 00:43:25.56 But as crazy as HR can act at times back in the day, he was inspirational beyond belief.
00:43:25.56 --> 00:43:30.36 He and the bad brands had the entire New Yorkard, your see, hardcore scene talking like
00:43:30.36 --> 00:43:33.08 fucking Jamaicans for the longest time.
00:43:33.08 --> 00:43:35.08 Everybody was like fire, bro, and blood clot.
00:43:35.08 --> 00:43:36.32 There's a stericle.
00:43:36.32 --> 00:43:37.32 There you go.
00:43:37.32 --> 00:43:41.28 The mob were so heavily influenced by them that the base players started growing dreads
00:43:41.28 --> 00:43:43.12 and wearing a roster hat.
00:43:43.12 --> 00:43:47.000 A whole contingent of white roster started popping up on the hardcore scene.
00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:49.48 They took things to another level.
00:43:49.48 --> 00:43:51.96 It was impossible not to be inspired by the bad brands.
00:43:51.96 --> 00:43:57.24 The only way to describe HR would be like James Brown meets Johnny Rotten meets Bob Marley.
00:43:57.24 --> 00:43:59.24 He was such a dynamic front man.
00:43:59.24 --> 00:44:04.04 HR could do a standing back flip and land right at the end of the song, nail it right
00:44:04.04 --> 00:44:05.56 at the last beat.
00:44:05.56 --> 00:44:08.24 It was like, oh my god, did he just plan that?
00:44:08.24 --> 00:44:11.96 I remember one time at A7, which was a tiny club.
00:44:11.96 --> 00:44:15.64 Within the first two minutes or so of their show, he had already knocked the sheet rock ceiling
00:44:15.64 --> 00:44:18.04 out and bent the Mike stand in half.
00:44:18.04 --> 00:44:21.48 The amount of explosive energy that would come out of that mother fucker, you couldn't
00:44:21.48 --> 00:44:23.16 help, it would be blown away.
00:44:23.16 --> 00:44:27.04 Especially since we were all young and here was this guy that was in shape.
00:44:27.04 --> 00:44:29.64 He used to be a javlin thrower back in high school.
00:44:29.64 --> 00:44:30.64 He was always athletic.
00:44:30.64 --> 00:44:34.36 So he had a bunch of scrawny punk rock mother fuckers and then this dude's up there.
00:44:34.36 --> 00:44:39.72 That was an athletic powerhouse going completely apeshit and he could sing his ass off and
00:44:39.72 --> 00:44:40.72 he could hit notes.
00:44:40.72 --> 00:44:44.32 HR came out there with a purpose like he was on a mission.
00:44:44.32 --> 00:44:46.92 Every show I saw there is back then was amazing.
00:44:46.92 --> 00:44:54.20 I remember I saw him up in Boston one time and he was like going, I guess fire pipes
00:44:54.20 --> 00:44:59.28 or whatever sprinkler pipes and he's leaping up and swinging on those things and jumping
00:44:59.28 --> 00:45:00.60 off into crowd.
00:45:00.60 --> 00:45:01.60 It was nuts.
00:45:01.60 --> 00:45:02.60 He was a must.
00:45:02.60 --> 00:45:05.96 He's also man, he spent half the show in the crowd.
00:45:05.96 --> 00:45:17.72 He was, yeah, you know, you can't, you can't, you can't even, you know, yeah, man, they
00:45:17.72 --> 00:45:20.28 was something.
00:45:20.28 --> 00:45:25.04 Everybody has that moment though that period where they really, you know, will not
00:45:25.04 --> 00:45:29.96 everybody, but everybody who's like intense, you know, you think about your life, you
00:45:29.96 --> 00:45:35.04 can think of that one period where you were just on fucking point, you know, and they
00:45:35.04 --> 00:45:37.88 were like 16 at a ended like last week.
00:45:37.88 --> 00:45:44.52 You know, I would have been laughing.
00:45:44.52 --> 00:45:45.52 I would have been laughing.
00:45:45.52 --> 00:45:51.72 That's some of us, but yeah, there was a period when they were just fucking untouchable.
00:45:51.72 --> 00:45:56.32 And you know, if you've seen HR now, yeah, I've seen him over the few actually.
00:45:56.32 --> 00:46:01.48 Like, seen him talk to him.
00:46:01.48 --> 00:46:06.48 I, last time I spoke to him and he came out to my house was probably around 2011 or 2010.
00:46:06.48 --> 00:46:11.44 And, you know, he's definitely, you know, he's got some issues.
00:46:11.44 --> 00:46:13.72 He had suffered some serious.
00:46:13.72 --> 00:46:19.44 He has like mental issues, you know, I mean, I don't know what his diagnosis is.
00:46:19.44 --> 00:46:23.76 I'm not going to stay in here and pretend to know, but it's, you know, but you can tell
00:46:23.76 --> 00:46:25.76 there's a clear change.
00:46:25.76 --> 00:46:30.68 But yeah, that guy from that guy, yeah, that guy now, there's something that's definitely
00:46:30.68 --> 00:46:34.84 clear as something a psychological difference, you know, and I, you can't just blame
00:46:34.84 --> 00:46:40.000 it all on drugs because, you know, some of us have done plenty of them and are fine.
00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:43.64 So I mean, there's, there's something that's, yeah.
00:46:43.64 --> 00:46:44.64 You know, and it's really sad.
00:46:44.64 --> 00:46:45.64 It's really sad.
00:46:45.64 --> 00:46:46.64 You know, they're playing.
00:46:46.64 --> 00:46:50.08 Well, you know, I don't, I don't know, I don't know when or what they're doing and
00:46:50.08 --> 00:46:51.08 playing.
00:46:51.08 --> 00:46:54.72 I mean, and God bless them, you know, I mean, Dr. Noah, you know, he suffered a stroke and
00:46:54.72 --> 00:46:58.000 a heart attack and he had to like learn how to use his hand again.
00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:03.52 And I, and everything, I actually did a benefit show us a record that's available on
00:47:03.52 --> 00:47:05.52 the pledge music.
00:47:05.52 --> 00:47:06.52 It's the only place you can get.
00:47:06.52 --> 00:47:11.84 You can't even buy it in stores and 48% of the music goes to help him just help him.
00:47:11.84 --> 00:47:15.92 Also, you know, to whatever he needs help with, you know, because God knows he's pledged
00:47:15.92 --> 00:47:16.92 music.
00:47:16.92 --> 00:47:21.40 Yeah, you just search pledged pledge music, Harley Flanagan, and the song will come up.
00:47:21.40 --> 00:47:26.20 It's one of the songs is called Friends Like You.
00:47:26.20 --> 00:47:28.40 But anyway, yeah, I mean, those guys were intense.
00:47:28.40 --> 00:47:33.88 I mean, it'll never be what it was, you know, I'm glad that they're doing their thing
00:47:33.88 --> 00:47:34.88 or, you know, whatnot.
00:47:34.88 --> 00:47:39.72 But I think my memory of them is from that period.
00:47:39.72 --> 00:47:40.72 Yeah.
00:47:40.72 --> 00:47:43.72 And he, he probably saw how many times did you see him?
00:47:43.72 --> 00:47:44.72 I don't know.
00:47:44.72 --> 00:47:45.72 I've got some.
00:47:45.72 --> 00:47:46.72 I have no idea.
00:47:46.72 --> 00:47:47.72 I saw them so many times.
00:47:47.72 --> 00:47:51.36 I saw them out on the west coast and, you know, excuse me.
00:47:51.36 --> 00:47:54.36 Yeah, I saw them in Tijuana.
00:47:54.36 --> 00:47:55.36 Oh, yeah.
00:47:55.36 --> 00:47:58.36 But HR wasn't where the, so it was kind of like, yeah.
00:47:58.36 --> 00:47:59.36 But not that's cool.
00:47:59.36 --> 00:48:00.36 No, no, no, no, no, no.
00:48:00.36 --> 00:48:02.36 I was the singers who were really good.
00:48:02.36 --> 00:48:05.36 Great dudes, great singers, but it's really hard to follow.
00:48:05.36 --> 00:48:08.36 And someone like, yeah, footsteps, I mean, that's a rough follow.
00:48:08.36 --> 00:48:09.36 That's a rough follow.
00:48:09.36 --> 00:48:10.36 Yeah, sure.
00:48:10.36 --> 00:48:16.36 So meanwhile, you did a trip to England.
00:48:16.36 --> 00:48:19.36 This is the first time you saw skinheads before.
00:48:19.36 --> 00:48:21.36 Well, I saw some skinheads.
00:48:21.36 --> 00:48:23.36 I got my head shaved in Ireland.
00:48:23.36 --> 00:48:28.36 I had seen skinheads one time before in London, but I didn't know what the fuck they were.
00:48:28.36 --> 00:48:29.36 I was just like, what the fuck?
00:48:29.36 --> 00:48:34.36 I like I can tell that there was something they had an interesting look like they, you know,
00:48:34.36 --> 00:48:36.36 but the shaved head thing was what got me.
00:48:36.36 --> 00:48:42.36 And yeah, so I met skinheads in England in the 70s, but I got my head shaved in
00:48:42.36 --> 00:48:44.36 Belfast in 1980.
00:48:44.36 --> 00:48:45.36 And here's what they told you.
00:48:45.36 --> 00:48:46.36 Going back to the book.
00:48:46.36 --> 00:48:49.36 I always remembered what the Belfast skins told me.
00:48:49.36 --> 00:48:51.36 Teach America about skinheads.
00:48:51.36 --> 00:48:56.36 The first few friends of mine to shave their heads included Adam Yach.
00:48:56.36 --> 00:48:57.36 We know that.
00:48:57.36 --> 00:48:58.36 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:48:58.36 --> 00:48:59.36 From the Beastie Boys.
00:48:59.36 --> 00:49:02.36 And a few others who weren't really skinheads in the stereotypical fuck way.
00:49:02.36 --> 00:49:04.36 They just like the look in the music.
00:49:04.36 --> 00:49:08.36 I mean, we were all into the early, always style music.
00:49:08.36 --> 00:49:12.36 Cockney rejects and bands like that, even though it wasn't really called Oya.
00:49:12.36 --> 00:49:17.36 The two-tone thing was happening with all the scob bands jumping off like the specials
00:49:17.36 --> 00:49:19.36 and selector and madness.
00:49:19.36 --> 00:49:22.36 And they were all popular with the skinheads early on.
00:49:22.36 --> 00:49:28.36 But there still wasn't a skinhead scene in New York just a few friends of mine who were up on it.
00:49:28.36 --> 00:49:30.36 We were going a couple of years all that would change.
00:49:30.36 --> 00:49:38.36 So obviously the typical person that doesn't follow the music scene, at least at a deeper level,
00:49:38.36 --> 00:49:46.36 when they think skinhead, they immediately think of sort of the branch that went off and got the most press,
00:49:46.36 --> 00:49:49.36 which was the neonazi skinheads.
00:49:49.36 --> 00:50:04.36 But the original, the origins of the skinheads is actually black dudes, rude boys, scob bands, like the specials and madness.
00:50:04.36 --> 00:50:08.36 And that's kind of what you saw.
00:50:08.36 --> 00:50:12.36 Yeah, I mean, I actually talk about a little bit of that in the book.
00:50:12.36 --> 00:50:19.36 I give a little bit of the historical information, just to give people a clearer idea.
00:50:19.36 --> 00:50:26.36 Yeah, but you know, the media always latches onto whatever is most sensationalistic.
00:50:26.36 --> 00:50:32.36 They try to always grab the worst aspects of what people are doing.
00:50:32.36 --> 00:50:38.36 And you know, yeah, you know, that you got it, you know.
00:50:38.36 --> 00:50:39.36 Yeah, yeah.
00:50:39.36 --> 00:50:47.36 I mean, I'll say one more thing, the New York scene had always been more diverse than most hardcore scenes that always been Spanish kids, black kids, Asian kids.
00:50:47.36 --> 00:50:51.36 A lot of the early New York hardcore skinheads were Spanish.
00:50:51.36 --> 00:50:52.36 Yeah.
00:50:52.36 --> 00:50:58.36 Majer from Agnostic Front, which if you don't know, Agnostic Front is probably, they might be considered like the,
00:50:58.36 --> 00:51:02.36 oh, they're definitely one of the biggest sort of skin head bands from America.
00:51:02.36 --> 00:51:06.36 And they were absolutely the first real like New York skin head.
00:51:06.36 --> 00:51:10.36 Yeah, you know, I mean, but yeah, you know, and he's Cuban, he's Cuban.
00:51:10.36 --> 00:51:14.36 Diego was Puerto Rican as was Jose from the mob.
00:51:14.36 --> 00:51:23.36 And so a lot of skinheads that came around later, even back in the Max's days, you had the bad brains pure how the influence of one of the first real New York hardcore bands.
00:51:23.36 --> 00:51:28.36 Yeah, I think where you just pulled up, I was just talking about the diversity on the scene in New York.
00:51:28.36 --> 00:51:37.36 New York has always been different from other places, you know, you, you know, that's one of the things that's cool about it here.
00:51:37.36 --> 00:51:38.36 Yeah.
00:51:38.36 --> 00:51:42.36 I could say you could say it's fairly diverse here in New York City.
00:51:42.36 --> 00:51:43.36 Fuck.
00:51:43.36 --> 00:51:51.36 You know, this is Gabby, one of the most, I bet you, I don't know, you have to look at this, but is New York City one of the most diverse places on the planet?
00:51:51.36 --> 00:51:54.36 It's far as like different languages that are spoken.
00:51:54.36 --> 00:52:02.36 I mean, one thing I noticed that, you know, you can eat any type of food here, you know, so it's hooked by a people that it's connected.
00:52:02.36 --> 00:52:06.36 Yeah, it's a big, so I mean, we had that moved here like three weeks ago.
00:52:06.36 --> 00:52:08.36 That's one thing I always loved about it here, you know.
00:52:08.36 --> 00:52:12.36 We just had gangmem style, uh, don't bling.
00:52:12.36 --> 00:52:14.36 Yeah, don't bling and sushi.
00:52:14.36 --> 00:52:17.36 Surred by by gangmem style.
00:52:17.36 --> 00:52:22.36 Oh, oh.
00:52:22.36 --> 00:52:32.36 And meanwhile, you know, at this time, back to the book, I was drinking a lot, huffing glue, taking pills and lots of LSD and whatever else.
00:52:32.36 --> 00:52:37.36 So this whole time, that's what's just prevalent in the same year.
00:52:37.36 --> 00:52:45.36 Yeah, New York was a very much, um, our scene liked to get fucked up.
00:52:45.36 --> 00:52:53.36 In DC, they were they invented straight edge, you know, they were there all about being clean and sober and and God bless them.
00:52:53.36 --> 00:53:01.36 And, you know, that caught on like wildfire in other places, you know, the straight edge movement spread and whatnot.
00:53:01.36 --> 00:53:04.36 And we always went the extreme opposite.
00:53:04.36 --> 00:53:09.36 We were like, you know, they had a song, don't drink, don't smoke, don't fuck.
00:53:09.36 --> 00:53:14.36 We used to sing, you know, we drink, we smoke, we fuck you.
00:53:14.36 --> 00:53:18.36 You know, and, um, yeah, we're a bunch of fucking idiots.
00:53:18.36 --> 00:53:27.36 You know, I mean, you know, unfortunately, you know, at that point in my life.
00:53:27.36 --> 00:53:31.36 And in the hardcore scene, uh,
00:53:31.36 --> 00:53:36.36 who's often cool how fucked up you could be.
00:53:36.36 --> 00:53:37.36 Yeah.
00:53:37.36 --> 00:53:48.36 And I'm sure it's that way in a lot of the world and a lot of youth culture and a lot of, you know, crews and gang culture and you know, I don't mean to theorize.
00:53:48.36 --> 00:53:51.36 But I'm going to do it a little bit of a last five.
00:53:51.36 --> 00:53:56.36 You know, like, cultures back in the day or some cultures, even today,
00:53:56.36 --> 00:54:05.36 when you want to prove that you are will sacrifice yourself for the tribe a little bit, like, I'll go hunt that lion or I'll go out and do something that's hard.
00:54:05.36 --> 00:54:10.36 And that's hard. And I'll take risks for the group. And I'll prove that that I don't care what happens to me.
00:54:10.36 --> 00:54:11.36 Yeah.
00:54:11.36 --> 00:54:13.36 I should have been in the place.
00:54:13.36 --> 00:54:16.36 Some places I think that, hey, I'm going to prove that I don't care what's happened to me.
00:54:16.36 --> 00:54:20.36 Watch me drink this, watch me shoot this, watch me smoke this and whatever.
00:54:20.36 --> 00:54:21.36 No, I agree.
00:54:21.36 --> 00:54:28.36 I think that that instinct that still in us doesn't have a place to be used properly.
00:54:28.36 --> 00:54:32.36 And I'll tell you where I got that philosophy from in the Seal teams.
00:54:32.36 --> 00:54:41.36 Man, when I came in, it was like the way that you kind of proved that you were tough was drinking and fighting.
00:54:41.36 --> 00:54:44.36 Yeah, drinking and fighting, everything to a fucking extreme.
00:54:44.36 --> 00:54:46.36 If you fucking drink five, I'll drink 10.
00:54:46.36 --> 00:54:47.36 Yeah.
00:54:47.36 --> 00:54:49.36 You fought two motherfuckers off, fight fucking five motherfuckers.
00:54:49.36 --> 00:54:51.36 And that's what it was.
00:54:51.36 --> 00:54:56.36 And when the war started, it did not like that stopped because that stuff still goes on.
00:54:56.36 --> 00:54:59.36 But it definitely in my mind, it in my mind, I was thinking,
00:54:59.36 --> 00:55:02.36 and we still drank, I was still party, I didn't got after it.
00:55:02.36 --> 00:55:05.36 But it was different, man.
00:55:05.36 --> 00:55:09.36 It was different to all the sudden be saying, hey, look, you know what I need to prove myself is on the battlefield.
00:55:09.36 --> 00:55:10.36 I need to be ready for that.
00:55:10.36 --> 00:55:17.36 And so when I apply that to like all of society, it seems like a young kid like you,
00:55:17.36 --> 00:55:21.36 who's 15, 16 years old, how do you prove that you're tough?
00:55:21.36 --> 00:55:22.36 How do you prove your manhood?
00:55:22.36 --> 00:55:26.36 Oh, you think you can drink 12 shots, I'll drink 20.
00:55:26.36 --> 00:55:27.36 Bring it.
00:55:27.36 --> 00:55:28.36 Yeah.
00:55:28.36 --> 00:55:32.36 And you know, you talked about like the straight edge movement and those guys, it's interesting.
00:55:32.36 --> 00:55:36.36 Well, they took it to a level 2, they stopped fucking.
00:55:36.36 --> 00:55:37.36 They even did, they stopped.
00:55:37.36 --> 00:55:39.36 And again, smoking that fucking.
00:55:39.36 --> 00:55:42.36 And then how did they prove how did they did then prove that they were tough?
00:55:42.36 --> 00:55:45.36 They would go out and fight and beat up people that were drunk and shit like that.
00:55:45.36 --> 00:55:47.36 Well, that's how we started happening in some scenes.
00:55:47.36 --> 00:55:48.36 Yeah.
00:55:48.36 --> 00:55:53.36 Because like in DC, those guys were always, they always tried to be more PC.
00:55:53.36 --> 00:55:55.36 They always had a little bit more consciousness.
00:55:55.36 --> 00:56:01.36 But in a lot of other places, you had bands like you know, you got, I got in trouble with Ian McKay.
00:56:01.36 --> 00:56:03.36 Adam.
00:56:03.36 --> 00:56:06.36 Remember when Fugazi came on this day?
00:56:06.36 --> 00:56:09.36 So Fugazi, one of my buddies from DC, this is back in the day.
00:56:09.36 --> 00:56:13.36 And one of those guys, one of my buddies from DC.
00:56:13.36 --> 00:56:15.36 They sent me a demo tape.
00:56:15.36 --> 00:56:18.36 And he said, hey, this is Ian's new band.
00:56:18.36 --> 00:56:19.36 And you're a guy.
00:56:19.36 --> 00:56:20.36 No, I was like cool.
00:56:20.36 --> 00:56:21.36 I had to grade out.
00:56:21.36 --> 00:56:23.36 No, I was like, yeah, I was great.
00:56:23.36 --> 00:56:25.36 And so we went and saw him in Brooklyn.
00:56:25.36 --> 00:56:28.36 Me and my boys went down to Brooklyn to see him.
00:56:28.36 --> 00:56:30.36 And we went berserk.
00:56:30.36 --> 00:56:32.36 And he wasn't feeling that.
00:56:32.36 --> 00:56:34.36 And he was like, and he had like longer curly hair.
00:56:34.36 --> 00:56:36.36 And he's standing there.
00:56:36.36 --> 00:56:39.36 And he put like, they played her first song and we just cleared out.
00:56:39.36 --> 00:56:40.36 Yeah.
00:56:40.36 --> 00:56:42.36 To destroy everything was like, he was like,
00:56:42.36 --> 00:56:45.36 He was like, um, hey, I'm just trying to think what he says.
00:56:45.36 --> 00:56:46.36 So he knows I'm not bullshit.
00:56:46.36 --> 00:56:49.36 If you ever hears this, he said something along the lines of like,
00:56:49.36 --> 00:56:52.36 let's leave our, let's leave our machoism and our ego is at the door.
00:56:52.36 --> 00:56:55.36 You know, if you're going to dance, be cool or something like that.
00:56:55.36 --> 00:56:57.36 And so then I was like,
00:56:57.36 --> 00:56:59.36 What do I do now?
00:56:59.36 --> 00:57:00.36 Music rocks.
00:57:00.36 --> 00:57:02.36 I want to break stuff.
00:57:02.36 --> 00:57:03.36 And I couldn't.
00:57:03.36 --> 00:57:07.36 So, I remember when he started going that route.
00:57:07.36 --> 00:57:08.36 And you know what God bless him.
00:57:08.36 --> 00:57:10.36 No, man, you said he got a lot of respect for you.
00:57:10.36 --> 00:57:11.36 I was fucking cool as fuck.
00:57:11.36 --> 00:57:12.36 Yeah.
00:57:12.36 --> 00:57:14.36 And he has always had his integrity.
00:57:14.36 --> 00:57:17.36 And as he, as he matured,
00:57:17.36 --> 00:57:19.36 you know,
00:57:19.36 --> 00:57:21.36 his way of thinking.
00:57:21.36 --> 00:57:23.36 Yeah, and you know what you got to respect him.
00:57:23.36 --> 00:57:25.36 Yeah, he held the line with what he did.
00:57:25.36 --> 00:57:27.36 And he's recklessly never sold out.
00:57:27.36 --> 00:57:29.36 You know what hats off.
00:57:29.36 --> 00:57:31.36 First of all, he's fucking legit man.
00:57:31.36 --> 00:57:32.36 First of all, I got none.
00:57:32.36 --> 00:57:33.36 First of all,
00:57:33.36 --> 00:57:35.36 Now,
00:57:35.36 --> 00:57:36.36 at this time,
00:57:36.36 --> 00:57:39.36 used to break his balls fucking relentlessly though.
00:57:39.36 --> 00:57:40.36 But that's just the way I am.
00:57:40.36 --> 00:57:43.36 If I, if I like someone and respect the chances of I'm going to really
00:57:43.36 --> 00:57:46.36 fuck with them whenever I have the opportunity.
00:57:46.36 --> 00:57:47.36 You know,
00:57:47.36 --> 00:57:52.36 yeah, um, so fuck you.
00:57:52.36 --> 00:57:54.36 Yeah, I hear that.
00:57:54.36 --> 00:57:55.36 At that time, you,
00:57:55.36 --> 00:57:59.36 you kind of came up with the name of the Kromax name.
00:57:59.36 --> 00:58:00.36 Yeah.
00:58:00.36 --> 00:58:05.36 And you started like tagging everything with the old mags.
00:58:05.36 --> 00:58:06.36 Yeah, yeah.
00:58:06.36 --> 00:58:08.36 You just, you had a kick ass band.
00:58:08.36 --> 00:58:10.36 That's like when we talked about my first
00:58:10.36 --> 00:58:12.36 the hardcore band called Bronson's Children.
00:58:12.36 --> 00:58:13.36 First thing we did,
00:58:13.36 --> 00:58:14.36 no music.
00:58:14.36 --> 00:58:15.36 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:58:15.36 --> 00:58:17.36 You got to hit it.
00:58:17.36 --> 00:58:19.36 You put the merchandise.
00:58:19.36 --> 00:58:21.36 So, you know, that's what we did.
00:58:21.36 --> 00:58:23.36 But you were doing the same thing.
00:58:23.36 --> 00:58:24.36 Yeah, we did that.
00:58:24.36 --> 00:58:24.36 Right.
00:58:24.36 --> 00:58:26.36 If you could actually play music, and I was just,
00:58:26.36 --> 00:58:27.36 yeah.
00:58:27.36 --> 00:58:28.36 Uh,
00:58:28.36 --> 00:58:30.36 uh,
00:58:30.36 --> 00:58:32.36 let's see what we're going with this one.
00:58:32.36 --> 00:58:36.36 So you started coming, putting together the band.
00:58:36.36 --> 00:58:41.36 And then things started getting a little bit crazy.
00:58:41.36 --> 00:58:43.36 You beat someone up,
00:58:43.36 --> 00:58:45.36 who's some friend of someone else, and all of a sudden,
00:58:45.36 --> 00:58:47.36 you heard that you had like a price on your head.
00:58:47.36 --> 00:58:49.36 That was actually before the Kromax really,
00:58:49.36 --> 00:58:51.36 was the, yeah, it was pretty crombo.
00:58:51.36 --> 00:58:52.36 It's like a band at the name.
00:58:52.36 --> 00:58:55.36 Yeah, that's actually why I wound up,
00:58:55.36 --> 00:58:56.36 um,
00:58:56.36 --> 00:58:57.36 heading out to California.
00:58:57.36 --> 00:59:00.36 I had to take a little break for my neighborhood.
00:59:00.36 --> 00:59:01.36 Uh-huh.
00:59:01.36 --> 00:59:03.36 Yeah, it was pretty intense, man.
00:59:03.36 --> 00:59:04.36 This dude, um,
00:59:04.36 --> 00:59:07.36 all right, there was a gang on my block called the Hitman.
00:59:07.36 --> 00:59:08.36 And this is back, and, you know,
00:59:08.36 --> 00:59:10.36 I remember them from the 70s through to the 80s.
00:59:10.36 --> 00:59:12.36 I mean, this is when they still used to wear colors.
00:59:12.36 --> 00:59:14.36 You know, patches on the,
00:59:14.36 --> 00:59:17.36 in fact, the Puerto Rican gangs looked more like
00:59:17.36 --> 00:59:19.36 bikers, like Puerto Rican bikers,
00:59:19.36 --> 00:59:22.36 without bikes back then, like they all had like patches
00:59:22.36 --> 00:59:24.36 and jeans and like MC boots,
00:59:24.36 --> 00:59:26.36 and, you know, they'd wear like the F-True Pats
00:59:26.36 --> 00:59:28.36 and with total old school, you know,
00:59:28.36 --> 00:59:33.36 like, you know, wolf tails and shit, you know,
00:59:33.36 --> 00:59:34.36 like the fur collar.
00:59:34.36 --> 00:59:35.36 This is like ridiculous.
00:59:35.36 --> 00:59:36.36 If you look on the old YouTube,
00:59:36.36 --> 00:59:38.36 and then old photos of New York gangs would be like,
00:59:38.36 --> 00:59:40.36 oh, okay, that's what he's talking about.
00:59:40.36 --> 00:59:41.36 Anyway, yeah, these guys were fun.
00:59:41.36 --> 00:59:42.36 Yeah, these guys were fucking,
00:59:42.36 --> 00:59:43.36 there was no joke.
00:59:43.36 --> 00:59:46.36 And one of the Hitman was Pigman,
00:59:46.36 --> 00:59:48.36 and he, you know, they did hits.
00:59:48.36 --> 00:59:50.36 They weren't called the Hitman, you know,
00:59:50.36 --> 00:59:52.36 because they, you know, wrote hit songs.
00:59:52.36 --> 00:59:54.36 You know, they, you know,
00:59:54.36 --> 00:59:56.36 they beside selling heroin,
00:59:56.36 --> 00:59:58.36 they did hits and,
00:59:58.36 --> 01:00:01.36 pigman, I'd known about him,
01:00:01.36 --> 01:00:02.36 my whole child,
01:00:02.36 --> 01:00:06.36 he was like a lower-yside myth,
01:00:06.36 --> 01:00:08.36 like, you know, everybody had heard of him,
01:00:08.36 --> 01:00:09.36 but no one knew, you know,
01:00:09.36 --> 01:00:11.36 because if you saw him,
01:00:11.36 --> 01:00:13.36 most likely the last thing you saw,
01:00:13.36 --> 01:00:14.36 you know,
01:00:14.36 --> 01:00:16.36 but he would wear a pig's mask.
01:00:16.36 --> 01:00:17.36 That's why he was called Pigman,
01:00:17.36 --> 01:00:19.36 and he would pull up in his blue and over,
01:00:19.36 --> 01:00:21.36 and fucking blast you with a shotgun.
01:00:21.36 --> 01:00:23.36 And it was that simple.
01:00:23.36 --> 01:00:27.36 And they actually kicked in a friend of mine's door
01:00:27.36 --> 01:00:29.36 and put shoties and people's mouths
01:00:29.36 --> 01:00:30.36 and guns to their heads,
01:00:30.36 --> 01:00:33.36 whereas Harley and one of the skin head apartments
01:00:33.36 --> 01:00:34.36 looking for me,
01:00:34.36 --> 01:00:36.36 and they came to my squat,
01:00:36.36 --> 01:00:38.36 pulled someone into a corner,
01:00:38.36 --> 01:00:39.36 and put knives to their throats,
01:00:39.36 --> 01:00:41.36 which apartments Harley in,
01:00:41.36 --> 01:00:44.36 and Pigman was cruisin' by my friends
01:00:44.36 --> 01:00:45.36 with the mask on,
01:00:45.36 --> 01:00:47.36 and didn't see me,
01:00:47.36 --> 01:00:49.36 so kept driving, I guess.
01:00:49.36 --> 01:00:51.36 So it was real.
01:00:51.36 --> 01:00:53.36 And I'm like,
01:00:53.36 --> 01:00:54.36 I was like,
01:00:54.36 --> 01:00:56.36 15, you know,

01:00:57.36 --> 01:00:59.36 I got fucking pigman looking for me.
01:00:59.36 --> 01:01:00.36 I mean, that's fucking no joke.

01:01:34.36 --> 01:01:35.36 Yeah.
01:01:35.36 --> 01:01:36.36 So that's just,
01:01:36.36 --> 01:01:37.36 that's because you beat somebody up.
01:01:37.36 --> 01:01:38.36 Yeah,
01:01:38.36 --> 01:01:39.36 I used to,
01:01:39.36 --> 01:01:41.36 I used to get in a lot of fights,
01:01:41.36 --> 01:01:42.36 and I used to also,
01:01:42.36 --> 01:01:43.36 you know,
01:01:45.36 --> 01:01:46.36 yeah,
01:01:46.36 --> 01:01:47.36 I beat someone up.
01:01:47.36 --> 01:01:48.36 And it turned out he was a,
01:01:48.36 --> 01:01:50.36 it was this guy who was a,
01:01:50.36 --> 01:01:53.36 a owner of one of the after hours clubs.
01:01:53.36 --> 01:01:54.36 I'm a lower East side.
01:01:54.36 --> 01:01:56.36 And a lot of these after hours clubs,
01:01:56.36 --> 01:01:57.36 like,
01:01:57.36 --> 01:01:57.36 you know,
01:01:57.36 --> 01:01:59.36 saved the robots and the pyramid,
01:01:59.36 --> 01:02:01.36 and all these other places they had,
01:02:01.36 --> 01:02:01.36 like,
01:02:01.36 --> 01:02:02.36 you know,
01:02:02.36 --> 01:02:04.36 they were the late night free clubs,
01:02:04.36 --> 01:02:06.36 where everybody would go like to a six in the morning,
01:02:06.36 --> 01:02:08.36 and they would all be doing blow and doing coke.
01:02:08.36 --> 01:02:10.36 So I guess that's how they knew the hitman,
01:02:10.36 --> 01:02:14.36 because they all used to all the club freaks used to buy all their drugs from the Puerto Rican and the neighborhood.
01:02:14.36 --> 01:02:16.36 So we were kind of fucking up their business too,
01:02:16.36 --> 01:02:17.36 because we were like,
01:02:17.36 --> 01:02:18.36 fucking up all the,
01:02:18.36 --> 01:02:21.36 all the new freaks that we started to come to the lower East side,

01:04:46.36 --> 01:04:47.36 you're surviving,
01:04:47.36 --> 01:04:47.36 like,
01:04:47.36 --> 01:04:48.36 yeah.
01:04:48.36 --> 01:04:49.36 you're,
01:04:49.36 --> 01:04:49.36 you're,
01:04:49.36 --> 01:04:50.36 you're getting food somehow, right?
01:04:50.36 --> 01:04:50.36 Yeah.
01:04:50.36 --> 01:04:51.36 You're stealing food.
01:04:51.36 --> 01:04:52.36 You're lifting your food.
01:04:52.36 --> 01:04:53.36 You're lifting your food.
01:04:53.36 --> 01:04:54.36 You're lifting your food.
01:04:54.36 --> 01:04:55.36 You're lifting your food.
01:04:55.36 --> 01:04:58.96 You're lifting, paying handling, and mugging people.
01:04:58.96 --> 01:05:01.96 You know, figuring it out, figuring it out.
01:05:01.96 --> 01:05:04.76 And that's what everyone in this fat these days are doing.
01:05:04.76 --> 01:05:06.88 Yeah, well, I mean, there was only a couple of us
01:05:06.88 --> 01:05:08.84 that were out mugging people because there was only
01:05:08.84 --> 01:05:11.24 like me and Mark Dagger and a couple of other people
01:05:11.24 --> 01:05:14.000 who were like hard asses, everybody else was either
01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.24 out, paying handling or turning tricks.
01:05:16.24 --> 01:05:20.20 You know, it was like, you know, you either out mugging
01:05:20.20 --> 01:05:24.32 someone, suckin' a dick, or begging for change.
01:05:24.32 --> 01:05:29.04 You know, and we, did you just think like,
01:05:29.04 --> 01:05:30.96 okay, this is what life is like?
01:05:30.96 --> 01:05:33.40 Yeah, that's what life was like.
01:05:33.40 --> 01:05:39.76 You know, I remember like eating it soup kitchens,
01:05:39.76 --> 01:05:42.32 you know, with adults and I'm like 15.
01:05:42.32 --> 01:05:44.88 And that being weird and almost getting into fights
01:05:44.88 --> 01:05:47.20 with like dudes who were like X-cons
01:05:47.20 --> 01:05:49.48 and you know, like dudes who had just got out of prison
01:05:49.48 --> 01:05:50.60 who were like to them.
01:05:50.60 --> 01:05:52.32 They were still in the prison lunch room.
01:05:52.32 --> 01:05:55.08 You know, and to me, I'm just like trying to,
01:05:55.08 --> 01:05:58.80 you know, get some food, you know.
01:05:58.80 --> 01:06:01.12 And yeah, it was pretty intense, you know.
01:06:01.12 --> 01:06:05.48 I mean, but to be fair, I had a great fucking time.
01:06:05.48 --> 01:06:08.64 You know, I mean, I had a lot of fun, you know.
01:06:08.64 --> 01:06:11.40 The, the, the, the, the bartering, the violence, the drugs.
01:06:11.40 --> 01:06:13.40 I had a fucking blast.
01:06:13.40 --> 01:06:14.96 I, would I recommend any of it?
01:06:14.96 --> 01:06:18.64 No, would I wish it on my kids or my worst enemies?
01:06:18.64 --> 01:06:20.84 No, did I have a great time?
01:06:20.84 --> 01:06:22.20 Yes.
01:06:22.20 --> 01:06:25.64 You know, I had the, how I fucking made it.
01:06:25.64 --> 01:06:29.76 I don't know, but, you know, I guess it's, I guess,
01:06:29.76 --> 01:06:31.20 is that like when people talk about,
01:06:31.20 --> 01:06:34.28 well, when people say to me, oh, I think this is the same thing
01:06:34.28 --> 01:06:35.92 because I'm sitting here going to happen that before.
01:06:35.92 --> 01:06:38.60 But I guess, yeah, no, dude, people I think about like being
01:06:38.60 --> 01:06:41.92 not think about the most intense situations you've been in.
01:06:41.92 --> 01:06:45.56 It's like the adrenaline, the fucking, like dude,
01:06:45.56 --> 01:06:48.20 the last time I got in like a real fucking crate,
01:06:48.20 --> 01:06:51.44 you know, not the last time, the third or fourth to last time.
01:06:51.44 --> 01:06:54.20 I got in a really bad violent situation.
01:06:54.20 --> 01:06:57.64 Like, one, it's in the book when I got, had like,
01:06:57.64 --> 01:07:00.16 that I fucked up this dude who was in a gang.
01:07:00.16 --> 01:07:02.76 And the next thing I know I got like 30 dudes fucking coming
01:07:02.76 --> 01:07:04.56 after me with pipes, bads, bop, bop, bop, bop,
01:07:04.56 --> 01:07:05.80 smashing out our windows.
01:07:05.80 --> 01:07:09.56 And I'm running into the crowd of them to save a friend of mine.
01:07:09.56 --> 01:07:14.92 Now see, like, dude, I was fucking like high for like a week
01:07:14.92 --> 01:07:16.32 off of the adrenaline.
01:07:16.32 --> 01:07:17.80 And then when I finally came down,
01:07:17.80 --> 01:07:20.84 I was like, whoa, what the fuck was that, man?
01:07:20.84 --> 01:07:24.52 I could have died, you know, but like for literally a week
01:07:24.52 --> 01:07:29.52 after that shit, I was just like, yeah, I fucking bring it.
01:07:29.52 --> 01:07:33.52 You know, and, and, you know, that's like,
01:07:33.52 --> 01:07:35.72 but that's the difference between certain type of people.
01:07:35.72 --> 01:07:40.36 Like, you know, I will run into a fucking violence
01:07:40.36 --> 01:07:41.32 to save a friend.
01:07:41.32 --> 01:07:42.32 Yeah.
01:07:42.32 --> 01:07:46.04 And a lot of fucking people that I grew up with will fucking
01:07:46.04 --> 01:07:50.84 punk out, I've seen people that I respected.
01:07:50.84 --> 01:07:54.84 Fucking run and leave their friends behind.
01:07:54.84 --> 01:07:57.24 And there's some real pussy shit, especially when they're trying
01:07:57.24 --> 01:07:59.88 to be all badass skinheads, get to, you know,
01:07:59.88 --> 01:08:00.88 oh, yeah, something down.
01:08:00.88 --> 01:08:03.84 Are you a nun, but a bitch, you know?
01:08:03.84 --> 01:08:09.000 And, hey, man, and, you know, and that's one reason why I'm really
01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:12.64 fucking proud to be here, you know, because it's like, you guys,
01:08:12.64 --> 01:08:17.40 one of the things I respect the most is someone who will put
01:08:17.40 --> 01:08:21.28 themselves on the line for someone else.
01:08:21.28 --> 01:08:26.88 Like, when you will put your own life at risk for another
01:08:26.88 --> 01:08:32.16 person, there's nothing more admirable than that.
01:08:32.16 --> 01:08:37.72 So hats off to you guys and to all, all the military out there,
01:08:37.72 --> 01:08:41.80 you know, serving this country and serving their brothers,
01:08:41.80 --> 01:08:44.40 sisters, their families and everybody, you know, hats off,
01:08:44.40 --> 01:08:47.88 man, it takes a lot of fucking balls and I respect.
01:08:47.88 --> 01:08:51.64 And I'm not, you know, even law enforcement, you know, and I'm not
01:08:51.64 --> 01:08:55.24 a big fan of the police in many circles.
01:08:55.24 --> 01:08:58.12 I've become friends with a lot of cops since I started doing
01:08:58.12 --> 01:08:59.12 jujitsu.
01:08:59.12 --> 01:09:00.76 Do you two change a lot of things for the cops?
01:09:00.76 --> 01:09:05.12 But, however, you know, I still have my reservations, but I
01:09:05.12 --> 01:09:09.08 respect, again, anybody who is willing to put their life on
01:09:09.08 --> 01:09:12.56 the line for others and for the greater good, you know,
01:09:12.56 --> 01:09:15.64 and there's really nothing higher.
01:09:15.64 --> 01:09:16.64 Yeah, you know.
01:09:16.64 --> 01:09:17.64 Yeah.
01:09:17.64 --> 01:09:21.36 Well, like obviously, I've got my work with the police and
01:09:21.36 --> 01:09:23.24 they're the same way man.
01:09:23.24 --> 01:09:25.04 They're, and they got a f-d-shhh.
01:09:25.04 --> 01:09:26.80 They got one of the hardest jobs in all of the world.
01:09:26.80 --> 01:09:29.000 No, no, look, I say that with, you know, a little bit
01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:30.92 tongue and cheeky, you know, I mean, it's like I've grown up
01:09:30.92 --> 01:09:33.36 always being on the shitty end of the stick when it comes to the
01:09:33.36 --> 01:09:34.36 cops.
01:09:34.36 --> 01:09:36.84 And, you know, still to this day, even like when I'm trying to get
01:09:36.84 --> 01:09:39.56 something achieved and accomplished and I try to go to them
01:09:39.56 --> 01:09:42.000 for guidance, they still look at me like they want to
01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:43.000 slap the cuff on me.
01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.60 More than fucking help me out, you know.
01:09:45.60 --> 01:09:50.40 So, you know, but, you know, I'm just, but I do understand,
01:09:50.40 --> 01:09:54.60 you know, what they deal with on a regular basis.
01:09:54.60 --> 01:09:55.96 So, I get it.
01:09:55.96 --> 01:09:58.84 But I also think that a lot of people are attracted towards
01:09:58.84 --> 01:10:02.44 lines of work that give them a position where they can
01:10:02.44 --> 01:10:04.24 abuse their position.
01:10:04.24 --> 01:10:06.000 You know, I think that happened.
01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:07.76 That's the human race, though.
01:10:07.76 --> 01:10:11.60 I mean, it's not like a go do a ride along with some cops,
01:10:11.60 --> 01:10:12.60 man.
01:10:12.60 --> 01:10:13.60 I do it.
01:10:13.60 --> 01:10:13.60 It is.
01:10:13.60 --> 01:10:14.60 I couldn't do it, man.
01:10:14.60 --> 01:10:18.40 But cops is just, what they deal with on a day to day
01:10:18.40 --> 01:10:19.80 basis, what it does to the brain.
01:10:19.80 --> 01:10:23.04 No, I mean, it looks, you know, hard ass job.
01:10:23.04 --> 01:10:24.60 People don't understand.
01:10:24.60 --> 01:10:28.20 I mean, it's like there's a certain level of, you know,
01:10:28.20 --> 01:10:34.20 once you've seen some shit, you're always on that edge,
01:10:34.20 --> 01:10:39.08 yeah, you know, and that fight that fight of flight, you know,
01:10:39.08 --> 01:10:41.16 and unfortunately, they don't have the choice.
01:10:41.16 --> 01:10:42.12 They have no choice.
01:10:42.12 --> 01:10:42.96 They have to deal with it.
01:10:42.96 --> 01:10:43.60 They've got to fight.
01:10:43.60 --> 01:10:47.64 So, you know, so, and they got to protect, you know,
01:10:47.64 --> 01:10:51.08 to, of course, you see, oh, we always see the negative thing of
01:10:51.08 --> 01:10:54.40 cops, but they're trying to work within certain guidelines.
01:10:54.40 --> 01:10:55.60 And that makes you the heart.
01:10:55.60 --> 01:10:58.80 And at the end of the time, they're going, no, hey, sir,
01:10:58.80 --> 01:11:00.96 please put the bat down, put the knife down.
01:11:00.96 --> 01:11:01.72 That's what they're doing.
01:11:01.72 --> 01:11:05.76 I think I said, sucks, you know, sucks to hard ass job.
01:11:05.76 --> 01:11:06.28 Hard ass job.
01:11:06.28 --> 01:11:09.32 But, you know, again, I got, you know, I also got to play,
01:11:09.32 --> 01:11:12.08 I got to keep my one foot grounded in the streets.
01:11:12.08 --> 01:11:14.80 I still have my, you know, you were, yeah,
01:11:14.80 --> 01:11:18.80 your condition, yes, from your childhood, yeah.
01:11:18.80 --> 01:11:22.08 That the man, you were on the other side,
01:11:22.08 --> 01:11:23.48 you were on the other side, man.
01:11:23.48 --> 01:11:24.68 You're on the other side.
01:11:24.68 --> 01:11:26.84 And so now that's how your condition is.
01:11:26.84 --> 01:11:30.92 We just, just like when they, when they see you,
01:11:30.92 --> 01:11:33.000 well, I don't know if they see you now.
01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.36 Well, you know, yeah, things are a little different now,
01:11:35.36 --> 01:11:40.36 but, you know, hey, you know, what the fucking you're gonna do?
01:11:40.36 --> 01:11:43.40 Well, I'll tell you what I do.
01:11:43.40 --> 01:11:44.68 When the cops tell you do something.
01:11:44.68 --> 01:11:45.52 Oh, I do it.
01:11:45.52 --> 01:11:46.36 I don't fucking run.
01:11:46.36 --> 01:11:47.24 I'm like, look, obviously.
01:11:47.24 --> 01:11:48.24 No problem.
01:11:48.24 --> 01:11:49.84 Not, not, no problem.
01:11:49.84 --> 01:11:50.68 No problem.
01:11:50.68 --> 01:11:51.68 That's how you, that's how you make friends.
01:11:51.68 --> 01:11:53.84 Yeah, I see my stupid fucking friends were like,
01:11:53.84 --> 01:11:55.60 yo fuck that, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.
01:11:55.60 --> 01:11:58.16 It's like, fuck this problem.
01:11:58.16 --> 01:11:59.88 All you had to do is say, yes, sir,
01:11:59.88 --> 01:12:01.56 how fucking difficult is that?
01:12:01.56 --> 01:12:04.32 You know, motherfucker, you that stupid.
01:12:06.32 --> 01:12:08.68 Man, we haven't even gotten to like the Chrome Mags yet.
01:12:08.68 --> 01:12:09.84 Have we?
01:12:09.84 --> 01:12:10.68 Who the Chrome Mags?
01:12:10.68 --> 01:12:11.84 Oh, yeah.
01:12:11.84 --> 01:12:14.20 Like put together the first album, you know what I mean?
01:12:14.20 --> 01:12:15.04 Yeah.
01:12:15.84 --> 01:12:16.68 Shit.
01:12:18.44 --> 01:12:19.28 So,
01:12:21.64 --> 01:12:23.60 you guys finally get together.
01:12:23.60 --> 01:12:24.80 Here we go, back to the book.
01:12:24.80 --> 01:12:26.72 It been three years since Paris and you,
01:12:26.72 --> 01:12:28.04 so Paris, the guy was,
01:12:28.04 --> 01:12:29.84 he was the guitarist from the Chrome Mags.
01:12:29.84 --> 01:12:33.92 He hooked up and started writing November 2nd, 1984.
01:12:33.92 --> 01:12:36.68 And on February 16th, 1985,
01:12:36.68 --> 01:12:38.60 the Chrome Mags went into high five studios
01:12:38.60 --> 01:12:41.72 on 27th Street and Park Avenue recorded 12 songs,
01:12:41.72 --> 01:12:44.04 the Age of Coral cassette,
01:12:44.04 --> 01:12:46.80 which is released on CD called Before the Coral.
01:12:46.80 --> 01:12:49.04 Yeah, that was the original version of the album
01:12:49.04 --> 01:12:52.96 before we actually went and recorded the album,
01:12:52.96 --> 01:12:53.80 Age of Coral.
01:12:53.80 --> 01:12:55.12 So that's 84.
01:12:55.12 --> 01:12:55.64 Yeah.
01:12:55.64 --> 01:12:56.64 That that's going down.
01:12:56.64 --> 01:12:57.32 Yes.
01:12:57.32 --> 01:13:01.12 And that's a good recording.
01:13:01.12 --> 01:13:02.08 I have that too.
01:13:02.08 --> 01:13:05.36 I actually like it a lot better than the album I was telling you before.
01:13:05.36 --> 01:13:06.88 I can't tell if I, I, I,
01:13:06.88 --> 01:13:07.88 I like it so much.
01:13:07.88 --> 01:13:11.04 I've recorded my head that I expect little things
01:13:11.04 --> 01:13:11.88 that aren't there.
01:13:11.88 --> 01:13:13.80 And so I, I like the first one better
01:13:13.80 --> 01:13:15.24 because I think it's this more raw.
01:13:15.24 --> 01:13:17.76 It is more, you know, that it's more explosive.
01:13:17.76 --> 01:13:20.44 I think it's more true to what we actually sounded like
01:13:20.44 --> 01:13:22.88 when we played live, you know?
01:13:22.88 --> 01:13:23.56 Yeah.
01:13:23.56 --> 01:13:25.76 The other thing, the other one had,
01:13:25.76 --> 01:13:28.72 you know, a lot of productions shit that I wasn't too happy about.
01:13:28.72 --> 01:13:29.56 But yeah.
01:13:29.56 --> 01:13:32.76 So now this is where now you think the story has been crazy so far.
01:13:32.76 --> 01:13:34.76 Echo, I'll just throw you into the bus right now.
01:13:34.76 --> 01:13:36.32 The story has been crazy.
01:13:36.32 --> 01:13:39.04 Now it goes just takes another kind of,
01:13:39.04 --> 01:13:42.56 what I, I consider it's an even more, more bizarre turn
01:13:42.56 --> 01:13:45.04 than everything we've talked about so far.
01:13:45.04 --> 01:13:46.72 So going back to the book,
01:13:48.32 --> 01:13:50.28 I was into vegetarianism,
01:13:50.28 --> 01:13:52.76 but it took me a while to get into Krishna.
01:13:52.76 --> 01:13:55.68 At first, John, this is the singer from the Chrome AG
01:13:55.68 --> 01:13:58.28 or one of the singers that sang into Chrome AGs,
01:13:58.28 --> 01:14:00.52 John and me used to go to the trucks
01:14:00.52 --> 01:14:02.28 where they served free food and Tom,
01:14:02.28 --> 01:14:05.44 Compton Square Park, which was a big hangout back in the day.
01:14:05.44 --> 01:14:07.76 And everyone used to go there and hang out.
01:14:07.76 --> 01:14:09.80 A lot of hard-cork kids did.
01:14:09.80 --> 01:14:11.56 I mean, I was living in a squat.
01:14:11.56 --> 01:14:12.56 I was vegetarian.
01:14:12.56 --> 01:14:16.60 I had no money and here was free vegetarian food.
01:14:16.60 --> 01:14:19.84 They also had a few preaching centers on the west side
01:14:19.84 --> 01:14:22.64 that me and John used to go to to eat,
01:14:22.64 --> 01:14:27.04 but still it took a while to give a fuck about what they were saying.
01:14:27.04 --> 01:14:28.52 I was there for the free food.
01:14:28.52 --> 01:14:29.72 I wasn't looking for religion.
01:14:29.72 --> 01:14:31.56 I was just hungry and trying to survive.
01:14:31.56 --> 01:14:32.76 We would always show up late.
01:14:32.76 --> 01:14:36.000 John would tell us when the good time was just to get the food,
01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000 after the reading and preaching and everything.
01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.72 But over time, I really started getting into the philosophy.
01:14:40.72 --> 01:14:42.88 In the beginning, people didn't take John and Krishna
01:14:42.88 --> 01:14:43.72 seriously.
01:14:43.72 --> 01:14:47.28 It was kind of something the hardcore scene laughed at.
01:14:47.28 --> 01:14:49.60 But as my friends and me started getting into Krishna,
01:14:49.60 --> 01:14:50.44 it started to change.
01:14:50.44 --> 01:14:53.64 So you guys started getting into Harry Krishna?
01:14:53.64 --> 01:14:54.48 Yeah.
01:14:54.48 --> 01:14:55.32 Yes.
01:14:55.32 --> 01:14:58.32 Which is pretty funny looking back now.
01:14:58.32 --> 01:15:01.44 Tell me the fundamental philosophies.
01:15:01.44 --> 01:15:02.80 I mean, obviously,
01:15:02.80 --> 01:15:04.56 Harry Krishna's are vegetarian.
01:15:04.56 --> 01:15:05.08 Yes.
01:15:05.08 --> 01:15:08.20 Because they don't want to hurt animals.
01:15:08.20 --> 01:15:10.04 Actually, it's more to it than that.
01:15:10.04 --> 01:15:13.24 It's actually not why it's because now I'm going to start fucking
01:15:13.24 --> 01:15:14.40 and talk another shit.
01:15:14.40 --> 01:15:15.60 Well, give me a little bit of it.
01:15:15.60 --> 01:15:18.16 It's a big thing that they only eat food that are
01:15:18.16 --> 01:15:22.68 awful to God and you can't offer God a riding carcass to eat.
01:15:22.68 --> 01:15:24.40 OK.
01:15:24.40 --> 01:15:25.92 There's nothing to have to do with like,
01:15:25.92 --> 01:15:26.92 hey, we don't want to hurt things.
01:15:26.92 --> 01:15:28.52 So there's all this carmic stuff.
01:15:28.52 --> 01:15:32.40 If everybody likes to not make more karma for themselves,
01:15:32.40 --> 01:15:33.40 good or bad.
01:15:33.40 --> 01:15:34.36 See, that's what I'm saying.
01:15:34.36 --> 01:15:36.56 Like, this is why this is why it gets more bizarre to me.
01:15:36.56 --> 01:15:36.88 Yeah.
01:15:36.88 --> 01:15:37.88 Because you try to get to the other side.
01:15:37.88 --> 01:15:39.32 It's more karma for yourself.
01:15:39.32 --> 01:15:41.92 See, that's the thing is with the amount of karma I had
01:15:41.92 --> 01:15:42.80 over the end of it.
01:15:42.80 --> 01:15:43.92 Heated for myself.
01:15:43.92 --> 01:15:45.52 I was trying.
01:15:45.52 --> 01:15:48.04 But this is where it gets even more fucked up and twisted.
01:15:48.04 --> 01:15:51.76 Because you got me and my friends who were like recovering
01:15:51.76 --> 01:15:54.68 skinheads, like a better way of putting it.
01:15:54.68 --> 01:15:56.56 You know, dudes who used to go out and get in like,
01:15:56.56 --> 01:15:58.72 you know, 20 fights in a night.
01:15:58.72 --> 01:16:02.60 You know, put 19 people in ICU just because, you know,
01:16:02.60 --> 01:16:04.36 just walking from the east side to the west side.
01:16:04.36 --> 01:16:05.20 What you looking at?
01:16:05.20 --> 01:16:06.44 Buh, you know, fuck you.
01:16:06.44 --> 01:16:08.16 All night, just fucking wild.
01:16:08.16 --> 01:16:11.04 And, you know, and then all that shit with pig man
01:16:11.04 --> 01:16:13.76 and this and that and God knows how many other things.
01:16:13.76 --> 01:16:17.24 How many bodies I found and came across
01:16:17.24 --> 01:16:24.24 and, you know, how many, how much madness I had experienced, you know,
01:16:25.44 --> 01:16:28.16 like we were talking about, you know, it's like sometimes, you know,
01:16:28.16 --> 01:16:31.92 when you're dealing with life and death on a regular basis, you know,
01:16:31.92 --> 01:16:34.88 sometimes you're like, you know, God, you start calling out to God.
01:16:34.88 --> 01:16:36.36 You don't even know what the fuck God is.
01:16:36.36 --> 01:16:40.28 And you're just like, God help me, God, you know, please, you know,
01:16:40.28 --> 01:16:42.80 God makes help.
01:16:42.80 --> 01:16:47.20 It's the call of desperation, you know.
01:16:47.20 --> 01:16:53.20 And I would have never been into Christianity and this and that.
01:16:53.20 --> 01:16:55.52 I just, it all just sounded like a bunch of bullshit to me.
01:16:55.52 --> 01:17:00.20 And here I was actually hearing some things that made some sort of sense
01:17:00.20 --> 01:17:04.76 to my teenage mind, you know, karma.
01:17:04.76 --> 01:17:09.36 Woo, you know, all these other things that like we're like resonating with me,
01:17:09.36 --> 01:17:13.16 you know, and it's like, I needed that shit, you know,
01:17:13.16 --> 01:17:16.68 I needed some sort of guidance and had I not had something like that.
01:17:16.68 --> 01:17:20.76 I mean, it could have been fucking Buddha, it could have been whatever, you know,
01:17:20.76 --> 01:17:28.56 but I needed something that was greater than you need some kind of guidance and
01:17:28.56 --> 01:17:29.56 your little favor.
01:17:29.56 --> 01:17:30.68 I needed guidance, I needed a whole discipline.
01:17:30.68 --> 01:17:31.36 I needed hope.
01:17:31.36 --> 01:17:32.36 Oh, yeah.
01:17:32.36 --> 01:17:37.000 You know, and when I started going out to their farm for a little while,
01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:41.36 like they were getting up at like five, 30 in the morning and meditating and
01:17:41.36 --> 01:17:45.64 watching the sun come up and like it was like this whole, you know,
01:17:45.64 --> 01:17:54.72 going from like being like hunted by the gangs in my neighborhood to that,
01:17:54.72 --> 01:18:00.40 it was just like, I can't even really explain it.
01:18:00.40 --> 01:18:06.68 It really, it was like, I don't know how to fucking put it, man.
01:18:06.68 --> 01:18:08.64 It was just like it was like, here I am at peace.
01:18:08.64 --> 01:18:09.64 Yeah, I was going to say it.
01:18:09.64 --> 01:18:13.96 He sounds like people like Buddha first thought like, wow.
01:18:13.96 --> 01:18:18.12 You know, so that, but then the more I was involved in it, the more I seen, you know,
01:18:18.12 --> 01:18:24.12 that people in religions in general are typically a bunch of fucking hypocrites.
01:18:24.12 --> 01:18:28.68 You know, you get a lot of people preaching a lot of shit that they don't all fucking
01:18:28.68 --> 01:18:34.72 follow and all rules don't really fit all people.
01:18:34.72 --> 01:18:40.000 You know, every human is different and not everybody can follow the same guidelines.
01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:46.000 And when the thing is started becoming just belief, what the fuck is belief anyway?
01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:51.000 It's just what you choose to believe, you know, unless it's like this is real, you know,
01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:52.52 this is really cutting my face.
01:18:52.52 --> 01:18:53.52 That's really blood.
01:18:53.52 --> 01:18:58.96 This is, you know, I really have to eat food and breathe air.
01:18:58.96 --> 01:19:01.76 Belief is just that, you know.
01:19:01.76 --> 01:19:11.20 I still have, you know, my spiritual inclinations, I still believe in some sort of,
01:19:11.20 --> 01:19:17.84 I don't like to say that word God anymore because I don't, I don't have that overview
01:19:17.84 --> 01:19:21.40 that I know any fucking thing.
01:19:21.40 --> 01:19:28.40 I just know, I know I got a lot of love in my heart for the people I care about.
01:19:28.40 --> 01:19:36.08 And I know I want to try to do good things, you know, of done enough bad things.
01:19:36.08 --> 01:19:42.88 I'd like to try to prevent some people from experiencing what I experienced and at the same
01:19:42.88 --> 01:19:50.12 time I would like to share the great experiences that I had with people.
01:19:50.12 --> 01:19:55.72 You know, well, one of the, one of the great experiences and one of the things, the great
01:19:55.72 --> 01:19:58.36 things that you share to people is that, that out.
01:19:58.36 --> 01:20:01.64 That outman will go to here, going back to the book, the age of core.
01:20:01.64 --> 01:20:07.40 Some would call it one of the most, if not the most influential New York hardcore and crossover
01:20:07.40 --> 01:20:09.12 albums.
01:20:09.12 --> 01:20:16.72 It was recorded in mix in under 100 hours over a 14 day period January, February 1986,
01:20:16.72 --> 01:20:22.68 at East Side Sound by Steve Remote and Chris Williams in our manager and so called producer,
01:20:22.68 --> 01:20:23.56 but it was really Steve.
01:20:23.56 --> 01:20:27.80 So 86 comes around and you guys put together the age of core.
01:20:27.80 --> 01:20:31.48 Yeah, this is the one that got released on a big show.
01:20:31.48 --> 01:20:32.72 Yeah, it was like the first hard work.
01:20:32.72 --> 01:20:33.72 That's real fun.
01:20:33.72 --> 01:20:39.76 Yeah, it was the, I probably one of the first hardcore records to ever be put out on a real
01:20:39.76 --> 01:20:47.04 major label like something that wasn't like discord or slash records or something underground.
01:20:47.04 --> 01:20:48.36 Yeah.
01:20:48.36 --> 01:20:52.60 And now this is, you guys are, you guys are starting to get a big draw.
01:20:52.60 --> 01:20:54.80 I mean, huge draw outside of New York City.
01:20:54.80 --> 01:20:55.80 Yeah.
01:20:55.80 --> 01:21:07.80 And we went on to play with many other metal bands around that time.
01:21:07.80 --> 01:21:08.80 The whole crossover thing.
01:21:08.80 --> 01:21:09.80 Right.
01:21:09.80 --> 01:21:13.24 So yeah, for those of you that don't know crossover when he's talking about that, that's the
01:21:13.24 --> 01:21:17.80 crossover from hardcore to metal.
01:21:17.80 --> 01:21:18.80 And kind of combined.
01:21:18.80 --> 01:21:24.60 It was really when the metal head started discovering hard when people like Metallica started
01:21:24.60 --> 01:21:27.96 wearing GPH shirts and coming to see the Chrome eggs.
01:21:27.96 --> 01:21:28.96 Yeah.
01:21:28.96 --> 01:21:33.52 When people like anthrax started daring to come to CBGBs.
01:21:33.52 --> 01:21:34.52 Yeah.
01:21:34.52 --> 01:21:35.52 You know, and that's real quick.
01:21:35.52 --> 01:21:37.32 But the hardcore bands started getting more metallic.
01:21:37.32 --> 01:21:41.24 Well, yeah, because like metal head started shaving their heads and getting into hardcore.
01:21:41.24 --> 01:21:44.40 Like the kid like yourself, like kids who had been listening to Van Hale and then they were
01:21:44.40 --> 01:21:48.80 little who started getting into hardcore bands started getting more and then they're
01:21:48.80 --> 01:21:49.80 not know.
01:21:49.80 --> 01:21:50.80 We definitely.
01:21:50.80 --> 01:21:51.80 Yeah.
01:21:51.80 --> 01:21:52.80 I mean, they're not.
01:21:52.80 --> 01:21:53.80 Yeah.
01:21:53.80 --> 01:21:56.16 A lot of people tried to jump ship.
01:21:56.16 --> 01:21:59.24 You know, I guess, you know, I don't, I see that kind of jokingly.
01:21:59.24 --> 01:22:05.04 But I guess, you know, it seemed like there was more opportunity to actually make a living
01:22:05.04 --> 01:22:11.24 bigger audience, you know, actual record deals, you know, Pantera.
01:22:11.24 --> 01:22:12.24 Pantera.
01:22:12.24 --> 01:22:13.24 Fucking great band.
01:22:13.24 --> 01:22:14.24 Because Pantera.
01:22:14.24 --> 01:22:19.36 I mean, one of my favorite bands probably, you know, dime bag, fucking love
01:22:19.36 --> 01:22:20.36 that dude.
01:22:20.36 --> 01:22:30.20 And one of the worst tragedies imaginable to a music is, well, the fuck got shot on
01:22:30.20 --> 01:22:31.20 stage, right?
01:22:31.20 --> 01:22:32.84 And by a fucking psychotic fan.
01:22:32.84 --> 01:22:35.60 I mean, it's like, you know, but the fuck man.
01:22:35.60 --> 01:22:37.60 Yeah, that was awful.
01:22:37.60 --> 01:22:39.60 You know, yeah.
01:22:39.60 --> 01:22:40.60 Yeah.
01:22:40.60 --> 01:22:41.60 It's, yeah.
01:22:41.60 --> 01:22:46.40 I mean, not to not to talk about not to get into, you know, the whole Kromag beef and
01:22:46.40 --> 01:22:47.40 this and that.
01:22:47.40 --> 01:22:54.56 One thing I will say is, you know, it really bothers me that dime bag died like that
01:22:54.56 --> 01:22:58.12 and that they never, because I know they would have buried the hatchet by now and they would
01:22:58.12 --> 01:23:02.28 have done an amazing reunion tour and they would, they would have just kicked this shit
01:23:02.28 --> 01:23:04.000 out of everybody.
01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:05.92 And they'll never have that opportunity.
01:23:05.92 --> 01:23:14.20 Now, because he was robbed from us and to know that my band or such a bunch of stubborn
01:23:14.20 --> 01:23:21.16 immature, fucking old assholes that we could never actually embrace each other purely
01:23:21.16 --> 01:23:28.36 based on what we did achieve together and how many fans would be so happy.
01:23:28.36 --> 01:23:34.04 You know, because once once you're gone, you're gone and, you know, it's just very rare
01:23:34.04 --> 01:23:40.96 that four or five people will have that chemistry for a moment in life.
01:23:40.96 --> 01:23:46.44 So, you know, just based on that alone, it's pretty fucking sad and pathetic.
01:23:46.44 --> 01:23:47.44 Yeah.
01:23:47.44 --> 01:23:52.48 And it's weird run that you guys had because you guys, you guys, you guys were on the first
01:23:52.48 --> 01:23:53.48 yeah.
01:23:53.48 --> 01:23:54.48 I mean, yeah.
01:23:54.48 --> 01:23:59.24 And when I, you know, when I remember you guys touring and I didn't see you on the
01:23:59.24 --> 01:24:01.68 age of coral tour, because that wasn't really fast touring.
01:24:01.68 --> 01:24:02.68 You went, yeah.
01:24:02.68 --> 01:24:03.68 But I just did it.
01:24:03.68 --> 01:24:04.68 Yeah.
01:24:04.68 --> 01:24:05.68 And I'm particularly sure you see you.
01:24:05.68 --> 01:24:09.56 But I saw you on the best wishes tour, which was the next album that came out.
01:24:09.56 --> 01:24:10.80 You guys were big.
01:24:10.80 --> 01:24:15.04 I mean, you guys were in a flu, just to kind of put it perspective for people, like,
01:24:15.04 --> 01:24:20.32 I think the places where I saw you play, and this is kind of a national brand is the
01:24:20.32 --> 01:24:21.48 house of blues.
01:24:21.48 --> 01:24:23.48 If you've ever been to a house of blues, that's how you play.
01:24:23.48 --> 01:24:24.48 That was like, that's the house of blues.
01:24:24.48 --> 01:24:25.48 It's the place to play there.
01:24:25.48 --> 01:24:26.48 I'm not.
01:24:26.48 --> 01:24:27.48 Okay.
01:24:27.48 --> 01:24:28.48 I didn't know you actually played there.
01:24:28.48 --> 01:24:29.48 But like that kind of venue.
01:24:29.48 --> 01:24:34.56 So that's, in my mind, you know, that's a band that, when you're playing places that
01:24:34.56 --> 01:24:40.48 size, you can make a living, and if you keep going and stay consistent, you know, you
01:24:40.48 --> 01:24:42.72 can do fairly well for yourself.
01:24:42.72 --> 01:24:46.80 Now, this is the, so, you know, age of coral comes out.
01:24:46.80 --> 01:24:47.80 You guys are popular.
01:24:47.80 --> 01:24:49.64 You're, you're, you're getting after it.
01:24:49.64 --> 01:24:52.48 You're, you're filling up places.
01:24:52.48 --> 01:24:53.84 Best wishes, you're filling stuff.
01:24:53.84 --> 01:24:54.84 You're headlining.
01:24:54.84 --> 01:24:55.84 Best wishes.
01:24:55.84 --> 01:24:57.12 But you're playing with motorhead, too, before.
01:24:57.12 --> 01:24:58.12 Yeah.
01:24:58.12 --> 01:24:59.48 You're supposed to play with black Sabbath one time.
01:24:59.48 --> 01:25:00.48 Yeah.
01:25:00.48 --> 01:25:04.20 By the way, that would actually be the ultimate show of all time for me.
01:25:04.20 --> 01:25:07.12 I have to fucking agree from my favorite black Sabbath.
01:25:07.12 --> 01:25:09.44 That's just, that's not it.
01:25:09.44 --> 01:25:10.44 Yeah.
01:25:10.44 --> 01:25:11.44 That would be the best.
01:25:11.44 --> 01:25:12.44 Yeah.
01:25:12.44 --> 01:25:13.44 Black Sabbath to show up.
01:25:13.44 --> 01:25:14.44 Yeah.
01:25:14.44 --> 01:25:15.44 Yeah.
01:25:15.44 --> 01:25:16.44 There were some issues.
01:25:16.44 --> 01:25:17.44 Yeah.
01:25:17.44 --> 01:25:18.44 Yeah.
01:25:18.44 --> 01:25:19.44 That, yeah.
01:25:19.44 --> 01:25:23.04 And you have the flyer, the flyer, the buzz, the buzz, the buzz, the buzz.
01:25:23.04 --> 01:25:24.04 Dude.
01:25:24.04 --> 01:25:26.44 You know, I made it on a flyer with black Sabbath motorhead.
01:25:26.44 --> 01:25:29.16 You know, I was looking that out.
01:25:29.16 --> 01:25:31.20 But here's the crazy thing.
01:25:31.20 --> 01:25:32.64 I was reading the book.
01:25:32.64 --> 01:25:33.92 I couldn't believe this.
01:25:33.92 --> 01:25:35.92 You come home from those tours.
01:25:35.92 --> 01:25:36.92 Yeah.
01:25:36.92 --> 01:25:38.28 And you have no money.
01:25:38.28 --> 01:25:39.28 Yeah.
01:25:39.28 --> 01:25:40.60 Yeah.
01:25:40.60 --> 01:25:41.60 And you hear this.
01:25:41.60 --> 01:25:43.48 This is kind of like a rock and roll myth, right?
01:25:43.48 --> 01:25:47.04 Oh, the guy signs the contract, the producer.
01:25:47.04 --> 01:25:50.48 And I watched a bunch of programs about this.
01:25:50.48 --> 01:25:53.16 And what the, what the record companies do is they say, hey, look, we're going to give
01:25:53.16 --> 01:25:55.56 you a $100,000 advance for your next album.
01:25:55.56 --> 01:25:56.56 And then you go awesome.
01:25:56.56 --> 01:25:58.16 So they give you a hundred grand.
01:25:58.16 --> 01:26:02.84 And you start spending it and then they back charge you for your studio time and the
01:26:02.84 --> 01:26:03.84 promotion.
01:26:03.84 --> 01:26:07.48 And you know, literally at the end, you haven't even gone on tour.
01:26:07.48 --> 01:26:08.48 You owe them $20,000.
01:26:08.48 --> 01:26:09.48 $20,000.
01:26:09.48 --> 01:26:10.48 You're working to pay it off.
01:26:10.48 --> 01:26:11.48 Yeah.
01:26:11.48 --> 01:26:13.20 They lent you this money with interest.
01:26:13.20 --> 01:26:15.84 And so that's the kind of shit that was happening with you.
01:26:15.84 --> 01:26:18.68 And you come back off these tours, your famous.
01:26:18.68 --> 01:26:24.56 Because also at this time, now that I think about it, you and the Chrome ads, you guys
01:26:24.56 --> 01:26:26.60 were like on the cover of like the metal magazines.
01:26:26.60 --> 01:26:29.60 All those stupid metal magazines, man.
01:26:29.60 --> 01:26:32.60 You'd be like Skid Row on one page and awesome.
01:26:32.60 --> 01:26:33.60 Yeah.
01:26:33.60 --> 01:26:34.60 I thought fuck.
01:26:34.60 --> 01:26:35.60 Yeah.
01:26:35.60 --> 01:26:36.60 I see on one page me on the next.
01:26:36.60 --> 01:26:37.60 Yeah.
01:26:37.60 --> 01:26:38.60 So you were there.
01:26:38.60 --> 01:26:39.60 I mean, yeah.
01:26:39.60 --> 01:26:40.60 We were on the cuss.
01:26:40.60 --> 01:26:42.60 We were all right about to break it.
01:26:42.60 --> 01:26:43.60 You know.
01:26:43.60 --> 01:26:45.60 And you were still broke.
01:26:45.60 --> 01:26:46.60 You were coming up with those tours.
01:26:46.60 --> 01:26:48.60 It still would be living on the streets.
01:26:48.60 --> 01:26:53.60 I would, I would be coming off those tours and trying to figure out where I was staying
01:26:53.60 --> 01:26:56.60 or I'd be showing up at my grandma's house.
01:26:56.60 --> 01:27:01.80 You know, or I'd be like, you know, yeah, we got pretty fucked.
01:27:01.80 --> 01:27:05.80 You know, you don't know what you don't know.
01:27:05.80 --> 01:27:11.48 You know, that's so it's like when you're a kid and you ain't got no guidance, nobody
01:27:11.48 --> 01:27:12.48 looking out for you.
01:27:12.48 --> 01:27:13.98 You know, you make a lot of mistakes.
01:27:13.98 --> 01:27:16.08 And also back then, they had a much better monopoly.
01:27:16.08 --> 01:27:17.08 Yeah, they're completely inferior.
01:27:17.08 --> 01:27:18.08 They're nowadays.
01:27:18.08 --> 01:27:20.08 You can say, oh, you know what?
01:27:20.08 --> 01:27:21.08 I'll just make my own record.
01:27:21.08 --> 01:27:25.60 And I'll be able to distribute it through the internet and social media all the
01:27:25.60 --> 01:27:26.60 other stuff.
01:27:26.60 --> 01:27:29.80 That would have been helpful in those days as far as, you know,
01:27:29.80 --> 01:27:37.44 but, you know, I think that the internet and everything is also really kind of
01:27:37.44 --> 01:27:43.04 fuck music up because it's like people don't have to have any lineage or any connection
01:27:43.04 --> 01:27:44.04 to their roots anymore.
01:27:44.04 --> 01:27:47.28 It's like people who don't know anything can just Google it and cut it and paste it
01:27:47.28 --> 01:27:48.28 and call it their own.
01:27:48.28 --> 01:27:51.08 And the next thing you know, they're an artist and it's like, no, you're not a fucking
01:27:51.08 --> 01:27:52.08 artist.
01:27:52.08 --> 01:27:54.92 You're a fucking cut and paste and motherfucker who hasn't ever actually experienced
01:27:54.92 --> 01:27:55.92 a fucking thing.
01:27:55.92 --> 01:27:58.48 And you don't even know the history of what you're imitating.
01:27:58.48 --> 01:28:00.40 You just know that you're into it right now.
01:28:00.40 --> 01:28:01.84 So you're imitating it right now.
01:28:01.84 --> 01:28:08.56 The other crazy thing is, you know, it was hard to get like these records when I was
01:28:08.56 --> 01:28:09.56 a kid.
01:28:09.56 --> 01:28:10.40 Yeah, you had to know.
01:28:10.40 --> 01:28:11.40 You couldn't order them.
01:28:11.40 --> 01:28:16.20 You had to like get somebody that was going to go to New York and hey, if they have
01:28:16.20 --> 01:28:17.20 this album, can you pick it up?
01:28:17.20 --> 01:28:18.56 Where you go to Blika Bobbs and yeah.
01:28:18.56 --> 01:28:19.56 Yeah, you go to Blika.
01:28:19.56 --> 01:28:21.04 And it was like that.
01:28:21.04 --> 01:28:25.40 You couldn't just, but nowadays, you can, if you say, oh, the Chrome Mags are cool because
01:28:25.40 --> 01:28:26.40 I heard a song.
01:28:26.40 --> 01:28:30.08 You put them into Google, you get Chrome Mags, you get every other band that's been
01:28:30.08 --> 01:28:32.96 related to them, you get bounce, it sounds like them and you can just download them all
01:28:32.96 --> 01:28:34.32 immediately if it's no factor.
01:28:34.32 --> 01:28:35.76 It is kind of crazy.
01:28:35.76 --> 01:28:42.36 That's why for me, like, how many record total record albums I had and I loved music,
01:28:42.36 --> 01:28:47.44 I probably had like 80 records, right?
01:28:47.44 --> 01:28:48.76 80 records.
01:28:48.76 --> 01:28:51.12 All my computer right now, all my phone.
01:28:51.12 --> 01:28:55.28 I probably got 10,000 records, no, Kaka all kinds of songs, right?
01:28:55.28 --> 01:28:58.64 Every band that's ever existed, I got them on my phone.
01:28:58.64 --> 01:29:04.92 And you would shit if you saw my fucking album, you would shit.
01:29:04.92 --> 01:29:10.84 You would fucking be like a kid in the candy store man, you're fucking because I got everything
01:29:10.84 --> 01:29:14.40 from back then I got all, I got like motorhead test pressings.
01:29:14.40 --> 01:29:18.04 I got like, you're one of those guys because I get test pressings.
01:29:18.04 --> 01:29:23.48 I was watching some video with Rollins, because you know Rollins has, I do get my first
01:29:23.48 --> 01:29:24.48 single.
01:29:24.48 --> 01:29:29.92 I think he might have one of the most epic record clips.
01:29:29.92 --> 01:29:31.92 He likes weird stuff.
01:29:31.92 --> 01:29:36.28 He likes stuff that like, I wouldn't want it, but he's got, you know, first pressing test
01:29:36.28 --> 01:29:37.28 pressing.
01:29:37.28 --> 01:29:38.28 He's a freak.
01:29:38.28 --> 01:29:39.28 Yeah.
01:29:39.28 --> 01:29:40.88 And he's got money too.
01:29:40.88 --> 01:29:41.88 Yeah, he's a good dude.
01:29:41.88 --> 01:29:42.88 Yeah, yeah.
01:29:42.88 --> 01:29:44.36 Some people people.
01:29:44.36 --> 01:29:47.84 You end up trying to, trying to sue a little bit, I think you try to sue the record
01:29:47.84 --> 01:29:48.84 company or something.
01:29:48.84 --> 01:29:50.32 You end up just going into legal costs.
01:29:50.32 --> 01:29:54.28 But we were trying to, because we were trying desperately to get off of our record
01:29:54.28 --> 01:29:59.60 label and get away from our management because we got to a certain point where we were
01:29:59.60 --> 01:30:06.04 just on the verge of blowing up and profile was still treating us like chumps.
01:30:06.04 --> 01:30:07.20 We weren't getting no money.
01:30:07.20 --> 01:30:08.20 We weren't getting anything.
01:30:08.20 --> 01:30:10.92 We were getting treated like fucking dog shit.
01:30:10.92 --> 01:30:15.60 And someone who was working at Electra was interested in signing us.
01:30:15.60 --> 01:30:17.48 So we were like, Electra, Metallica.
01:30:17.48 --> 01:30:18.88 Here's our fucking shot.
01:30:18.88 --> 01:30:19.88 So we like got to do it.
01:30:19.88 --> 01:30:22.60 His profile was like, oh, metal is right?
01:30:22.60 --> 01:30:24.24 No, profile was actually a hip-hop.
01:30:24.24 --> 01:30:29.12 So they did with us was really kind of out there out there because they had, you know,
01:30:29.12 --> 01:30:30.12 they're big bands.
01:30:30.12 --> 01:30:31.12 Like, century media.
01:30:31.12 --> 01:30:35.52 That's came after no, profile was big for a run DMC.
01:30:35.52 --> 01:30:39.04 That was who they're, and then like, Rob base.
01:30:39.04 --> 01:30:42.36 It takes two, that was like there was big.
01:30:42.36 --> 01:30:43.68 That was their hits.
01:30:43.68 --> 01:30:45.32 Run DMC was their main shit.
01:30:45.32 --> 01:30:47.16 Speaking of crossover.
01:30:47.16 --> 01:30:48.16 Run DMC.
01:30:48.16 --> 01:30:49.16 Yeah.
01:30:49.16 --> 01:30:50.16 They brought the metal.
01:30:50.16 --> 01:30:51.16 They got a riff.
01:30:51.16 --> 01:30:53.60 I mean, you know, those guys were great, man.
01:30:53.60 --> 01:30:54.60 Yeah, that was pretty cool.
01:30:54.60 --> 01:30:57.04 I saw them play many times back in the day.
01:30:57.04 --> 01:31:00.60 I remember seeing them with the Beastie Boys at the Garden and that, that was a fucking great
01:31:00.60 --> 01:31:01.60 show.
01:31:01.60 --> 01:31:02.60 It's fun, man.
01:31:02.60 --> 01:31:07.60 It's like all the Beastie Boys brought all the white kids and run DMC, brought all the
01:31:07.60 --> 01:31:10.60 black kids and the black kids who just walking around, robbing all the white ladies.
01:31:10.60 --> 01:31:13.60 I've never been fucking laughing like fucking take off.
01:31:13.60 --> 01:31:16.60 Like watching people just get yoked in the fucking aisles.
01:31:16.60 --> 01:31:18.60 I like this shit as hilarious.
01:31:18.60 --> 01:31:21.60 Yeah, that was funny.
01:31:21.60 --> 01:31:26.24 So you're trying to get off that label and trying to get on to a lecture at damn.
01:31:26.24 --> 01:31:27.24 Because a lecture was huge.
01:31:27.24 --> 01:31:31.84 Yeah, yeah, that would have been a good move for us, but profile didn't like us and
01:31:31.84 --> 01:31:38.96 they would have rather taken, you know, they couldn't offer them enough money to give
01:31:38.96 --> 01:31:39.96 us our freedom.
01:31:39.96 --> 01:31:42.60 They were like, fuck these days.
01:31:42.60 --> 01:31:44.60 Yeah, we had some issues with some of them.
01:31:44.60 --> 01:31:46.32 He had people there.
01:31:46.32 --> 01:31:51.28 And then you end up with alpha omega.
01:31:51.28 --> 01:31:52.28 Yeah.
01:31:52.28 --> 01:31:54.28 And by the way, I didn't say this, but you sang on Best Wishes.
01:31:54.28 --> 01:31:57.28 Yeah, I sang on like half the album.
01:31:57.28 --> 01:31:58.28 Oh, God.
01:31:58.28 --> 01:32:01.28 And then me and John both sang on alpha omega.
01:32:01.28 --> 01:32:06.28 And I got to read this from the book because I got to kick out of it.
01:32:06.28 --> 01:32:07.28 Oh, boy.
01:32:07.28 --> 01:32:09.28 There he goes back to the book.
01:32:09.28 --> 01:32:14.28 You know how you can always tell when a heavy band is starting to lose their edge when
01:32:14.28 --> 01:32:17.28 they start using a fucking keyboard?
01:32:17.28 --> 01:32:19.28 Yeah, we did that.
01:32:19.28 --> 01:32:27.92 All right, to be fair, I was eating a lot of mushrooms that they were quitting session.
01:32:27.92 --> 01:32:32.000 So like things sounded a little bit different to me and they were sounding, the keyboard
01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:34.000 sounded cool, man.
01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:40.96 I was eating all kinds of mushrooms and chicken mushroom tea and I was like, yeah, that's
01:32:40.96 --> 01:32:41.96 it sounds cool.
01:32:41.96 --> 01:32:44.84 Yeah, I have rolled with that, you know.
01:32:44.84 --> 01:32:48.20 But see, at least I can look back and laugh at myself.
01:32:48.20 --> 01:32:52.24 You know, it's like if you can't fucking laugh at yourself, man, you're an asshole.
01:32:52.24 --> 01:32:55.20 And some other, I think I might have breeze through it, but there's another point where
01:32:55.20 --> 01:32:59.92 you're talking about how spinal tapish, like, all this, I mean, even that spinal tapish, right?
01:32:59.92 --> 01:33:01.92 We started to venture out.
01:33:01.92 --> 01:33:02.92 Yeah, you know what I'm saying?
01:33:02.92 --> 01:33:04.92 Yeah, you know, it's the stone hinge.
01:33:04.92 --> 01:33:05.92 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
01:33:05.92 --> 01:33:06.92 Yeah.
01:33:06.92 --> 01:33:10.88 So, and did you want to hear something really fucking funny?
01:33:10.88 --> 01:33:16.84 I mean, me and Doug watched spinal tap with John one time, just just to show you a bit
01:33:16.84 --> 01:33:17.84 about his intellect.
01:33:17.84 --> 01:33:21.32 I, we're watching about halfway through that movie.
01:33:21.32 --> 01:33:27.56 John turns to me and Doug goes, yo, man, these guys suck.
01:33:27.56 --> 01:33:28.96 I've never even heard of them.
01:33:28.96 --> 01:33:30.96 Why did they make a movie about them?
01:33:30.96 --> 01:33:35.76 And then Doug just look at each other, like, this motherfucking thing, this is a real
01:33:35.76 --> 01:33:36.76 documentary.
01:33:36.76 --> 01:33:38.76 Oh, my fucking, anyway.
01:33:38.76 --> 01:33:39.76 Sorry, I had it.
01:33:39.76 --> 01:33:44.92 Hey, you know what, I've seen spinal tap twice.
01:33:44.92 --> 01:33:45.92 Live.
01:33:45.92 --> 01:33:46.92 I saw them once.
01:33:46.92 --> 01:33:47.92 Yeah, yeah.
01:33:47.92 --> 01:33:48.92 I have a spinal tap, like that.
01:33:48.92 --> 01:33:49.92 Yeah, that's what's up.
01:33:49.92 --> 01:33:54.60 I brought my wife and you know what, they play big bottoms, you know, they're all
01:33:54.60 --> 01:33:55.60 played bass.
01:33:55.60 --> 01:33:56.60 Yeah, yeah.
01:33:56.60 --> 01:33:57.60 Yeah, yeah.
01:33:57.60 --> 01:33:58.60 That's what it was.
01:33:58.60 --> 01:34:00.60 That was a fucking brilliant, fucking movie.
01:34:00.60 --> 01:34:04.96 No, but I remember like being in those clothes where you're trying to find the
01:34:04.96 --> 01:34:05.96 stage, you're walking around.
01:34:05.96 --> 01:34:06.96 You're just like, all right, Cleveland.
01:34:06.96 --> 01:34:07.96 All right, Cleveland.
01:34:07.96 --> 01:34:09.96 You're like fucking walking around.
01:34:09.96 --> 01:34:10.96 You wind up outside the glove.
01:34:10.96 --> 01:34:12.96 You're like, we're fucking the major.
01:34:12.96 --> 01:34:14.96 Yeah.
01:34:14.96 --> 01:34:18.68 Now, you're still struggling.
01:34:18.68 --> 01:34:19.68 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
01:34:19.68 --> 01:34:20.68 Yeah, yeah.
01:34:20.68 --> 01:34:21.68 Yeah, yeah.
01:34:21.68 --> 01:34:22.68 Yeah, yeah.
01:34:22.68 --> 01:34:23.68 Yeah, yeah.
01:34:23.68 --> 01:34:24.68 Yeah, yeah.
01:34:24.68 --> 01:34:25.68 Yeah, yeah.
01:34:25.68 --> 01:34:26.68 Yeah, yeah.
01:34:26.68 --> 01:34:27.68 Yeah, yeah.
01:34:27.68 --> 01:34:28.68 Yeah, yeah.
01:34:28.68 --> 01:34:29.68 Yeah, yeah.
01:34:29.68 --> 01:34:30.68 Yeah, yeah.
01:34:30.68 --> 01:34:33.92 Before I get into this next chapter, I'm telling you that I had to lose a lot
01:34:33.92 --> 01:34:38.04 of stuff from this era, because I have kids now, and I don't want them to know exactly
01:34:38.04 --> 01:34:43.000 how insane things got, or to think I'm a worse piece of shit than they already will
01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:44.56 or do.
01:34:44.56 --> 01:34:48.52 But again, this is proof that you can plummet to the bottom of the worst depths of hell
01:34:48.52 --> 01:34:51.60 and still come back and try to become a better person.
01:34:51.60 --> 01:34:57.16 There was enough filth, drugs, or geez, violence, and crime during this period, to write
01:34:57.16 --> 01:34:59.52 a book about nothing else.
01:34:59.52 --> 01:35:05.08 As insane as it was, and as much fun as I thought I was having, deep down I was looking
01:35:05.08 --> 01:35:06.80 for a way out.
01:35:06.80 --> 01:35:09.76 I think that's why I took everything to such an extreme.
01:35:09.76 --> 01:35:13.88 I don't think I cared if I lived.
01:35:13.88 --> 01:35:16.76 There were times I don't think I wanted to.
01:35:16.76 --> 01:35:20.20 I'm not proud looking back on it now.
01:35:20.20 --> 01:35:28.84 If anything, I'm surprised I survived.
01:35:28.84 --> 01:35:29.84 Heavy.
01:35:29.84 --> 01:35:32.24 It's fucked up here and you read that shit, bro.
01:35:32.24 --> 01:35:35.76 It makes me go up.
01:35:35.76 --> 01:35:41.64 But yeah, man, it's true.
01:35:41.64 --> 01:35:51.44 I've seen some of my friends that they start to get the same outlook.
01:35:51.44 --> 01:36:00.56 They start doing shit that is not high survival rate activities.
01:36:00.56 --> 01:36:06.28 It's like they're walking that line of, you know, what's kind of like you want to die,
01:36:06.28 --> 01:36:10.28 but you're not going to take the pussy route and kill yourself.
01:36:10.28 --> 01:36:16.28 So you're just going to do everything you can to kill yourself without actually putting
01:36:16.28 --> 01:36:17.52 a rope around your neck.
01:36:17.52 --> 01:36:20.92 So instead of putting a rope around your neck, you put a rope around your arm and stick
01:36:20.92 --> 01:36:29.80 a fucking needle in it or smoke dust until the world is just a fucking illusion.
01:36:29.80 --> 01:36:34.48 I'm going to read this right here because this is, you know, here you go back to the book.
01:36:34.48 --> 01:36:36.68 At one point, I was broke a shit.
01:36:36.68 --> 01:36:41.28 This is after you have three albums signed by a major record contract torn all over the
01:36:41.28 --> 01:36:44.12 world, played with motorhead on tour.
01:36:44.12 --> 01:36:45.56 Here we go back to the book.
01:36:45.56 --> 01:36:51.08 At one point, I was broke a shit and I got busted shoplifting food at a supermarket.
01:36:51.08 --> 01:36:52.52 I didn't have any ID.
01:36:52.52 --> 01:36:56.48 So the kids I was with ran back to the house and came back with three of my CD covers
01:36:56.48 --> 01:36:57.48 as ID.
01:36:57.48 --> 01:37:02.44 I was sitting in this holding area in the back of the store and the store cops were looking
01:37:02.44 --> 01:37:03.44 at me all confused.
01:37:03.44 --> 01:37:05.20 They were like, this is your ID.
01:37:05.20 --> 01:37:09.12 I was holding up pictures from the age of coral best wishes in Alpho, Maga and I was
01:37:09.12 --> 01:37:11.68 like, see, look at the picture and look at my tattoos.
01:37:11.68 --> 01:37:12.92 This is me.
01:37:12.92 --> 01:37:14.44 They were like, you're kidding, right?
01:37:14.44 --> 01:37:15.76 This is all the ID you got.
01:37:15.76 --> 01:37:16.76 Yeah.
01:37:16.76 --> 01:37:19.76 That's, yeah, I didn't even have a fuck.
01:37:19.76 --> 01:37:22.88 I had no ID, I had nothing to do.
01:37:22.88 --> 01:37:23.88 You know what else?
01:37:23.88 --> 01:37:28.12 I just realized that I completely breased over is like I'm saying that you had this record,
01:37:28.12 --> 01:37:29.60 you had this record, you had this record, you had this record, you had this record, you're
01:37:29.60 --> 01:37:31.12 also a sick basis.
01:37:31.12 --> 01:37:33.52 I mean, like an unbelievable basis.
01:37:33.52 --> 01:37:37.12 You know, like, like, see, you had this incredible musical talent you played drums, too,
01:37:37.12 --> 01:37:41.16 but I mean, your bass playing is a better drummer.
01:37:41.16 --> 01:37:43.84 But that's, well, that's good.
01:37:43.84 --> 01:37:46.48 But your bass playing is sick.
01:37:46.48 --> 01:37:50.68 So you had all this talent and you had records and you had fans and you had all the
01:37:50.68 --> 01:37:53.84 shit and you're still down in the down in the door.
01:37:53.84 --> 01:37:54.84 Shoplifting to eat.
01:37:54.84 --> 01:37:55.84 Shoplifting.
01:37:55.84 --> 01:37:57.52 Fucking smoke and ice.
01:37:57.52 --> 01:37:58.52 Dude.
01:37:58.52 --> 01:38:01.52 Hey, man, you know it could have been worse, man.
01:38:01.52 --> 01:38:03.92 I mean, look at fucking people like Jocco Pistores.
01:38:03.92 --> 01:38:07.44 I mean, that motherfucker was like the most basis.
01:38:07.44 --> 01:38:13.000 Yeah, like the, and Jimmy Hendrix, you know, he was the Jimmy Hendrix of bass and
01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:18.000 look at Jimmy and him and it's like, you know, you can have all that talent and if you're,
01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:22.92 you know, if you're suffering on the inside, man, you know, mean fucking Jocco, there's
01:38:22.92 --> 01:38:23.92 another tragedy.
01:38:23.92 --> 01:38:28.28 motherfucker got beat to death by a bouncer, you know, who didn't know who he was.
01:38:28.28 --> 01:38:31.08 This is not this Jocco, this is, this is, this is, this is the place.
01:38:31.08 --> 01:38:32.08 Jocco Pistores.
01:38:32.08 --> 01:38:36.60 He actually got tried to get up on stage on a centanish show because he was friends
01:38:36.60 --> 01:38:40.56 with centan and he tried to get up on the stage and he was so fucking messy at the time
01:38:40.56 --> 01:38:44.36 that nobody could recognize him and the bouncer's threw him out and he kept being
01:38:44.36 --> 01:38:47.16 belligerent and he beat him to death.
01:38:47.16 --> 01:38:50.40 You know, so it's like you can have all the talent in the world, but you know, it's
01:38:50.40 --> 01:38:55.08 just, it's sad because really the people who are have that gift usually are people who
01:38:55.08 --> 01:38:56.52 are really emotionally.
01:38:56.52 --> 01:39:00.20 Well, that's why they have that gift because there's a fucking emotional.
01:39:00.20 --> 01:39:08.64 You know, I think, you know, that can really become destructive if you don't have a positive
01:39:08.64 --> 01:39:09.64 place.
01:39:09.64 --> 01:39:13.78 Like if you're really, the only times in my life where I haven't been all fucked up on
01:39:13.78 --> 01:39:20.68 drugs was when I had something constructive to do something that gave me a purpose.
01:39:20.68 --> 01:39:31.04 And when you have that creative emotional self destructive thing in you because it really
01:39:31.04 --> 01:39:34.60 can become self destructive if you don't have a place to put it.
01:39:34.60 --> 01:39:37.96 I mean, shit man, if you wouldn't have fucking gone into the military, God knows what
01:39:37.96 --> 01:39:40.40 the fuck you would have done with that intensity.
01:39:40.40 --> 01:39:42.76 No, the military, I've talked about it.
01:39:42.76 --> 01:39:44.16 You know, I mean, it's like you don't.
01:39:44.16 --> 01:39:45.16 It's a beautiful thing.
01:39:45.16 --> 01:39:46.16 It's a beautiful thing for me.
01:39:46.16 --> 01:39:48.64 Yeah, I mean, it probably would have been for me too.
01:39:48.64 --> 01:39:49.64 I just wound up.
01:39:49.64 --> 01:39:53.56 But you know, instead, I wanted to be soundtrack to you.
01:39:53.56 --> 01:39:59.12 But a lot of fighters, you know, you know, you have see fighters and stuff and a lot of
01:39:59.12 --> 01:40:01.40 those guys have a rough time, you know, absolutely.
01:40:01.40 --> 01:40:09.000 Because it's hard to be that type of an intense person and to go to such extreme emotional
01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:14.60 dumps because, you know, one second, you're just a tough guy on the street.
01:40:14.60 --> 01:40:17.88 The next second, you're a tough guy in front of fucking thousands of people and there's
01:40:17.88 --> 01:40:24.12 lights flashing everywhere, you know, and then, you know, and then some people, it's
01:40:24.12 --> 01:40:27.96 like your career is done and you're still that tough guy who still will fuck shit up,
01:40:27.96 --> 01:40:32.20 but nobody gives a fuck and now if you fuck somebody up, you're going to fucking jail.
01:40:32.20 --> 01:40:37.32 You know, and it's like, you know, and drugs become an easy way to deal with fame and
01:40:37.32 --> 01:40:42.24 the confusion of popularity and the depression.
01:40:42.24 --> 01:40:50.48 So, a heavy thing to go from to the silence of your room and your mind.
01:40:50.48 --> 01:40:54.96 There's a buddy of mine plays in a band called Slightly Stupid and there's actually
01:40:54.96 --> 01:41:00.52 a big band and they play in front, they're from San Diego and one of the guys and we're
01:41:00.52 --> 01:41:04.68 just, you know, he's got a little kid, just normal guy, but he plays in a slightly stupid
01:41:04.68 --> 01:41:09.56 and he was, you know, they just got back from tour and, you know, I just said something
01:41:09.56 --> 01:41:10.56 to him, you know, how was it?
01:41:10.56 --> 01:41:15.000 And he goes, man, it just never gets old, you know, get up in front of 10,000 people that
01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:16.48 are singing your songs, man.
01:41:16.48 --> 01:41:19.60 He said it's just like unbelievable.
01:41:19.60 --> 01:41:24.92 I tell you, man, I haven't been in tour on tour in a really long time and I'm last time
01:41:24.92 --> 01:41:28.32 I gigged out.
01:41:28.32 --> 01:41:37.04 I think the last time I did a tour was like 2011 or 2012 and then a lot of shit went
01:41:37.04 --> 01:41:45.96 to South in my life, go figure and I needed time to pull myself back up and get my
01:41:45.96 --> 01:41:48.16 shit back together.
01:41:48.16 --> 01:41:55.44 I'm going on tour in about nine days, I'll be playing in Berlin first, I'm gonna be playing
01:41:55.44 --> 01:42:02.28 a bunch of shows in Germany, I'll be playing in Venice and Italy and I'll be playing in Switzerland,
01:42:02.28 --> 01:42:04.36 I believe in Belgium and the UK.
01:42:04.36 --> 01:42:12.52 I'm gonna have about 12 or 13 shows in 13 or 14 days, I'm really, really looking forward
01:42:12.52 --> 01:42:16.12 to this.
01:42:16.12 --> 01:42:21.56 I'm not looking forward to driving five, six hour drives, I'm not looking forward to not
01:42:21.56 --> 01:42:26.20 sleeping in my bed, I'm not looking forward to not waking up next to my wife, I'm not
01:42:26.20 --> 01:42:33.000 looking forward to all that shit but I am really fucking looking forward to doing my thing
01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:35.04 again.
01:42:35.04 --> 01:42:40.64 I got so involved with jujitsu and teaching jujitsu and stuff that music actually started
01:42:40.64 --> 01:42:46.36 to take kind of a back seat, especially when I had my kids and I really couldn't tour
01:42:46.36 --> 01:42:49.32 and stuff anymore.
01:42:49.32 --> 01:42:54.12 While I was a choice I made, I could have done whatever the fuck I wanted but I chose
01:42:54.12 --> 01:42:56.52 to be there for my kids.
01:42:56.52 --> 01:43:06.16 Now they're older and so on and life is as made this possible to do again, I can't wait
01:43:06.16 --> 01:43:09.80 man.
01:43:09.80 --> 01:43:18.56 This affecting people the way you do with music, it's a, you make a connection, you know,
01:43:18.56 --> 01:43:22.08 you know, look man, I'm sitting across from you now because we're fucking out of my
01:43:22.08 --> 01:43:27.36 minute, 30 fucking years ago with that fucking tell you, it's bad ass, you know.
01:43:27.36 --> 01:43:31.12 It's good.
01:43:31.12 --> 01:43:37.60 You're going back to book here, you're at that point, you know, this is the same time period
01:43:37.60 --> 01:43:44.40 where you're getting arrested for shoplifting and here we go, I was in a state of depression
01:43:44.40 --> 01:43:47.56 and the drugs helped me stay in it.
01:43:47.56 --> 01:43:51.80 I was trying to get better as far as wanting to get off drugs at least half the time and
01:43:51.80 --> 01:43:57.28 I would for a few days or a week or so here or there but I was just too depressed and one
01:43:57.28 --> 01:44:03.84 thing would lead to another then back into the abyss, the death spiral into emptiness,
01:44:03.84 --> 01:44:07.08 nothing and nowhereness.
01:44:07.08 --> 01:44:12.16 Of course I was all into Alice and chains and nine inch nails and all that fucking depressed
01:44:12.16 --> 01:44:21.28 drug music but even as fucked up as I was, there was this wheat grass juice stand on
01:44:21.28 --> 01:44:25.48 mission and I'd still make sure to go get a shot of wheat grass juice every day because
01:44:25.48 --> 01:44:31.64 I figured hey at least wheat grass juice is equal to eating tons of vegetables.
01:44:31.64 --> 01:44:35.68 Well I was trying to sort of stay healthy like I was like okay I know I'm not eating
01:44:35.68 --> 01:44:41.04 regularly and I'm not eating very well so let me at least try to, you know.
01:44:41.04 --> 01:44:44.76 And this is this is nothing that's, again I think this shows your state.
01:44:44.76 --> 01:44:50.000 I go to my kids' doors heroin and fucking wheat grass juice.
01:44:50.000 --> 01:45:07.44 I'd go to music stores and pretend I was gonna buy shit and just play instruments.
01:45:07.44 --> 01:45:09.000 I'd hang out as long as I could and then leave.
01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:11.96 I actually got offered gigs while I was playing in stores.
01:45:11.96 --> 01:45:16.000 I got offered gigs for doing sessions for different producers but I'd be all fucked up
01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:19.20 and missed the session because I wouldn't know what day it was and then realize a day or
01:45:19.20 --> 01:45:22.72 two later I'd booze their business card or whatever.
01:45:22.72 --> 01:45:24.000 So you just can't get your shit.
01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:28.76 Yeah, I was really just, I was pretty fucking, it was embarrassing.
01:45:28.76 --> 01:45:31.12 And that was by the way that was taking place out on the West Coast.
01:45:31.12 --> 01:45:32.12 Yeah, yeah, no.
01:45:32.12 --> 01:45:33.68 And then just go.
01:45:33.68 --> 01:45:36.80 It sounds like, yeah I went to San Francisco to get clean off drugs.
01:45:36.80 --> 01:45:41.92 It's like the worst city of fucking, I don't you ever heard of Idaho?
01:45:41.92 --> 01:45:42.92 Yeah, I'm on Tana.
01:45:42.92 --> 01:45:55.36 Then you move back to New York and now you start kind of bringing it back together.
01:45:55.36 --> 01:45:59.20 I'd go for these long runs at night because I couldn't sleep.
01:45:59.20 --> 01:46:02.08 Your girl lived down by the Twin Towers and I'd run from there to central park and back
01:46:02.08 --> 01:46:03.08 on the way.
01:46:03.08 --> 01:46:06.52 It stopped by Coney Island High on St. Mark's place to see you was hanging out for a few minutes
01:46:06.52 --> 01:46:07.52 say hi.
01:46:07.52 --> 01:46:09.48 Then keep running up town to the top of the park.
01:46:09.48 --> 01:46:12.88 I'd run a few laps around the reservoir and then turn around and head back down on the way
01:46:12.88 --> 01:46:13.88 back down.
01:46:13.88 --> 01:46:17.76 It stopped by Coney Island High again and there would be the same people.
01:46:17.76 --> 01:46:21.48 Everyone was pretty much in the same place, just slightly more shit faced and it hanged
01:46:21.48 --> 01:46:24.32 for a few more minutes and then keep running.
01:46:24.32 --> 01:46:28.20 It was kind of good to see that as I was getting my shit together to see all these people
01:46:28.20 --> 01:46:32.24 not really doing anything but standing around getting fucked up as they got older and
01:46:32.24 --> 01:46:33.56 did nothing with themselves.
01:46:33.56 --> 01:46:38.44 It gave me motivation to keep my shit together.
01:46:38.44 --> 01:46:46.60 So yeah, that's when I started pulling myself back up.
01:46:46.60 --> 01:46:49.96 And one of the things that helped out with that.
01:46:49.96 --> 01:46:51.60 First of all, you guys got death jam.
01:46:51.60 --> 01:46:53.24 You guys got signed a death jam?
01:46:53.24 --> 01:46:54.24 Is that right?
01:46:54.24 --> 01:46:55.96 We had a big-gave you an advance of it.
01:46:55.96 --> 01:46:59.96 Yeah, we got an advance to record something for them and then the deal wound up falling
01:46:59.96 --> 01:47:05.84 apart so we wound up being left with the recordings in our possession that we were able
01:47:05.84 --> 01:47:07.72 to then put out ourselves.
01:47:07.72 --> 01:47:08.72 What album was that?
01:47:08.72 --> 01:47:09.72 Revenge.
01:47:09.72 --> 01:47:10.72 Okay.
01:47:10.72 --> 01:47:15.36 Which I thought was actually a really good album but it is what it is.
01:47:15.36 --> 01:47:17.28 The shit never managed to stay together.
01:47:17.28 --> 01:47:21.88 That band just had fucked up karma.
01:47:21.88 --> 01:47:25.60 And around this time you started your Jiu Jitsu career.
01:47:25.60 --> 01:47:26.60 Yes.
01:47:26.60 --> 01:47:32.72 Yeah, well I've said it many times man, hands-o really fucking saved my life in a lot of ways
01:47:32.72 --> 01:47:41.48 because even though I was doing those 12 mile runs and shit like that, I've worked my way
01:47:41.48 --> 01:47:43.48 up to really doing long ones.
01:47:43.48 --> 01:47:45.08 I started off doing like three or four miles.
01:47:45.08 --> 01:47:48.96 I got into it.
01:47:48.96 --> 01:47:58.48 But I would still have my moments of depression and I'd want to get fucked up and stuff.
01:47:58.48 --> 01:48:00.88 But I had Jiu Jitsu.
01:48:00.88 --> 01:48:03.48 And I was living in my rehearsal studio.
01:48:03.48 --> 01:48:04.80 I didn't even have a fucking shower.
01:48:04.80 --> 01:48:09.08 I was like bathing on the roof with filling up two gallon buckets.
01:48:09.08 --> 01:48:12.08 I'd go up there with like four or five buckets and just like bath.
01:48:12.08 --> 01:48:14.68 I was living in the rehearsal studio.
01:48:14.68 --> 01:48:20.44 I wasn't, you know, life was not great but every day I'd go and I'd train.
01:48:20.44 --> 01:48:26.88 And that gave me a place to find myself again.
01:48:26.88 --> 01:48:28.88 When was this?
01:48:28.88 --> 01:48:29.88 What year?
01:48:29.88 --> 01:48:34.12 It was like January February of 96.
01:48:34.12 --> 01:48:42.36 When I came back, I discovered MMA from UFC 1 and 2 when I was on the West Coast.
01:48:42.36 --> 01:48:46.40 I'm like, what the fuck did he just do to him?
01:48:46.40 --> 01:48:51.52 I probably hit thousand people in the face.
01:48:51.52 --> 01:48:53.64 I'm a kick thousand people in the head.
01:48:53.64 --> 01:48:55.72 Headbutt didn't bitten whatever.
01:48:55.72 --> 01:48:59.68 I ain't never seen a triangle, choker.
01:48:59.68 --> 01:49:01.60 The fuck is an arm bar.
01:49:01.60 --> 01:49:03.16 I made up my mind.
01:49:03.16 --> 01:49:05.40 This is when I was still on smack.
01:49:05.40 --> 01:49:06.76 I was like, I made up my mind.
01:49:06.76 --> 01:49:10.44 I was like, yo, if I ever get the chance to learn that shit, I'm going to fucking learn
01:49:10.44 --> 01:49:12.24 that shit.
01:49:12.24 --> 01:49:16.04 So when I came back to New York, I just kept going through like black belt magazine, kung fu
01:49:16.04 --> 01:49:17.04 magazine.
01:49:17.04 --> 01:49:19.16 One of these motherfuckers got to move right here sooner or later.
01:49:19.16 --> 01:49:20.16 This is New York.
01:49:20.16 --> 01:49:21.92 I mean, they can't all stay in California.
01:49:21.92 --> 01:49:22.92 They're fucking crazy.
01:49:22.92 --> 01:49:24.52 They're like a very big family.
01:49:24.52 --> 01:49:26.60 One of them's going to have to move out here.
01:49:26.60 --> 01:49:29.60 So Hanzo, I found an ad.
01:49:29.60 --> 01:49:35.44 Hanzo Kukk, Gracie Kukk, it said Gracie Kukk, or you're still with his old partner.
01:49:35.44 --> 01:49:41.12 Yeah, man, I went down and I met Hanzo and that changed my life.
01:49:41.12 --> 01:49:44.60 That was 21 years ago.
01:49:44.60 --> 01:49:48.04 And a lot of people are, they think, I don't know why they think it.
01:49:48.04 --> 01:49:51.48 But they think Jiu Jitsu is going to be, you know, kind of, when you walk in, it's going
01:49:51.48 --> 01:49:52.48 to be intimidating.
01:49:52.48 --> 01:49:56.84 And I could tell from the way you wrote about it, Hanzo, it's just like, hey, what's up,
01:49:56.84 --> 01:49:57.84 right?
01:49:57.84 --> 01:49:58.84 You know, it was a little bit fun.
01:49:58.84 --> 01:49:59.84 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
01:49:59.84 --> 01:50:03.52 He just makes you feel so welcome and so at home.
01:50:03.52 --> 01:50:12.92 And he's, you know, I can say this and mean it, you know, I really love that man.
01:50:12.92 --> 01:50:18.84 You know, he was there for me through some of the toughest parts of my life and he didn't
01:50:18.84 --> 01:50:22.80 give up on me and he believed in me.
01:50:22.80 --> 01:50:27.28 And sometimes really that's all you need is somebody to believe in you and not give up
01:50:27.28 --> 01:50:28.28 on you.
01:50:28.28 --> 01:50:33.64 And, you know, when I got arrested in 2012 and I was all over the papers and the news
01:50:33.64 --> 01:50:39.04 and everywhere, you know, they, a lot of people were shying away from me.
01:50:39.04 --> 01:50:41.52 Let's just say that.
01:50:41.52 --> 01:50:48.60 For those of you who don't know, I got jumped by about five or six guys.
01:50:48.60 --> 01:50:53.64 I wanted to bite a nice chunk out of one of their faces and slice in a couple of them
01:50:53.64 --> 01:50:55.48 and poke in one of them.
01:50:55.48 --> 01:50:58.76 In the process of me getting jumped, I got 40 stitches.
01:50:58.76 --> 01:51:04.04 I was stabbed and, you know, a lot of people were like, you know, I can't believe he did
01:51:04.04 --> 01:51:05.04 that.
01:51:05.04 --> 01:51:06.76 I'm like, I'm like, did what?
01:51:06.76 --> 01:51:08.32 You know, got jumped.
01:51:08.32 --> 01:51:12.92 You know, I got fucking jumped man and fucking tell me about slicing cut and stabbing.
01:51:12.92 --> 01:51:17.80 Fucking tell me shit about shit until you got five, six mother fuckers trying to take
01:51:17.80 --> 01:51:20.40 your fucking life.
01:51:20.40 --> 01:51:26.76 You know, then you can start talking about how could you this, how could you fuck you?
01:51:26.76 --> 01:51:30.68 You know, you got five dudes kicking you in your face, stomping on you.
01:51:30.68 --> 01:51:37.40 You had better be willing to stab bite or rip someone's balls off.
01:51:37.40 --> 01:51:42.64 You know, that's what people don't fucking understand who have never experienced real violence
01:51:42.64 --> 01:51:47.48 or real potential of death.
01:51:47.48 --> 01:51:50.76 You know, when I first got into GiGetsu, it was all about the fighting.
01:51:50.76 --> 01:51:55.20 You know, I was like, yeah, learn more ways to fuck people up.
01:51:55.20 --> 01:51:58.52 Now I really, it's, it has nothing to do with fighting for me anymore.
01:51:58.52 --> 01:52:00.56 I mean, I just love the art.
01:52:00.56 --> 01:52:04.16 I love the relationships that I've made through the art.
01:52:04.16 --> 01:52:08.40 I love sharing what I've learned.
01:52:08.40 --> 01:52:15.88 If anything, I'm, again, you know, the fight of flight man, I'm way more likely to run
01:52:15.88 --> 01:52:22.88 than fight at this point because I know how bad things can go.
01:52:22.88 --> 01:52:27.64 You know, like, I actually, I might have told the story before.
01:52:27.64 --> 01:52:33.24 There was a bad ass Marine and his name was DA.
01:52:33.24 --> 01:52:34.12 That's what I've been called them.
01:52:34.12 --> 01:52:37.96 And DA in the military, DA, start for short, for direct action.
01:52:37.96 --> 01:52:39.76 But that was his initials too.
01:52:39.76 --> 01:52:41.24 But it just worked.
01:52:41.24 --> 01:52:42.48 And he looked like a superhero.
01:52:42.48 --> 01:52:45.52 He's a total stud and he was a gangbanger from Texas.
01:52:45.52 --> 01:52:48.88 And, but, you know, he'd join, he'd be like you, right?
01:52:48.88 --> 01:52:52.16 But he joined, but he was a black kid, but he joined the Marine Corps.
01:52:52.16 --> 01:52:53.48 And he was in force recon.
01:52:53.48 --> 01:52:55.48 He was a total badass.
01:52:55.48 --> 01:52:58.68 And I said, hey, man, you got to come and try to do two out.
01:52:58.68 --> 01:53:00.28 And so he started training.
01:53:00.28 --> 01:53:04.88 And like after like six months, he came up to me.
01:53:04.88 --> 01:53:07.28 And I was like, hey, man, you know, because I was like still deploying.
01:53:07.28 --> 01:53:08.28 And he, so I wouldn't seem a lot.
01:53:08.28 --> 01:53:10.60 And I was like, man, how do you like to do two?
01:53:10.60 --> 01:53:12.84 He was like, man, it's kind of fucked up.
01:53:12.84 --> 01:53:17.40 And I was like, what do you mean, bro?
01:53:17.40 --> 01:53:18.40 It's awesome.
01:53:18.40 --> 01:53:22.32 He goes, you go, man, because I used to feel like a regal badass.
01:53:22.32 --> 01:53:25.52 Now everybody, I see, I'm thinking, I might be a pussy.
01:53:25.52 --> 01:53:30.44 So, yeah, man, it's funny.
01:53:30.44 --> 01:53:31.80 It's very humbling, you know?
01:53:31.80 --> 01:53:32.80 It is.
01:53:32.80 --> 01:53:34.60 It's a very humbling game to play.
01:53:34.60 --> 01:53:35.60 It really is.
01:53:35.60 --> 01:53:41.64 But, you know, at the same time though, to me, it is, it is that though.
01:53:41.64 --> 01:53:42.64 It is a game for me.
01:53:42.64 --> 01:53:49.88 It's like, when I think of fighting or when I think of self defense, I believe in
01:53:49.88 --> 01:53:50.88 jujitsu.
01:53:50.88 --> 01:53:56.000 I mean, I am 100% of believer, but jujitsu is fun for me.
01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:58.40 It's not about violence or self defense or fighting.
01:53:58.40 --> 01:53:59.40 You know, because it's funny.
01:53:59.40 --> 01:54:04.12 Yeah, because fighting and violence to me is about ending something.
01:54:04.12 --> 01:54:09.84 Ending somebody, you know, I mean, because I know I could die.
01:54:09.84 --> 01:54:11.12 I tell people a fucking time.
01:54:11.12 --> 01:54:15.28 I'm like, you know, you don't gotta worry about like a, you know, a black belt kicking
01:54:15.28 --> 01:54:16.28 your ass.
01:54:16.28 --> 01:54:17.68 Because he's a black belt.
01:54:17.68 --> 01:54:21.84 He's already matured past the need to kick your ass.
01:54:21.84 --> 01:54:26.44 You gotta worry about that 90 pound motherfucker who will stab you without you even having
01:54:26.44 --> 01:54:29.76 a chance to say dude, we don't need to have a problem.
01:54:29.76 --> 01:54:36.88 You know, you gotta worry about that dude who's just so don't give a fuck that before
01:54:36.88 --> 01:54:39.84 you even have a chance to say buddy.
01:54:39.84 --> 01:54:44.48 You're sure it's wet and you're like, oh shit.
01:54:44.48 --> 01:54:48.64 You know, and we've talked about that on here, you know, people say like, oh, I was
01:54:48.64 --> 01:54:52.04 going to get in this guy, said something to my wife, what should I have done?
01:54:52.04 --> 01:54:56.72 I'm like, just grab your wife, go home and buy her a nice dinner.
01:54:56.72 --> 01:54:58.20 Yeah, so honey, I love you.
01:54:58.20 --> 01:55:00.84 Yeah, you know, you know, it's not worth getting stabbed.
01:55:00.84 --> 01:55:04.16 Yeah, it's not worth having to stab that junkie.
01:55:04.16 --> 01:55:05.16 And then that either.
01:55:05.16 --> 01:55:08.36 And I just know from my own experience that there's always the potential that I could go
01:55:08.36 --> 01:55:09.36 to that extreme.
01:55:09.36 --> 01:55:13.16 I don't think for one second because I'm a jujitsu black belt that like, I'm just
01:55:13.16 --> 01:55:16.80 going to submit this guy and hold him down until the police get here because you know,
01:55:16.80 --> 01:55:21.44 what, that guy may have through other friends standing in the shadows behind you or that guy
01:55:21.44 --> 01:55:26.48 may fucking start stabbing you when you're looking to fucking you're trying to, you know,
01:55:26.48 --> 01:55:27.48 submit him.
01:55:27.48 --> 01:55:32.12 And I was suddenly like, why is my t-shirt wet?
01:55:32.12 --> 01:55:34.16 What, you know, why is my pants wet?
01:55:34.16 --> 01:55:37.48 Oh my God, that's fucking red.
01:55:37.48 --> 01:55:46.96 So, I mean, that's just life, you know, that's why, you know, now as good as jujitsu
01:55:46.96 --> 01:55:52.12 isn't as good as you felt doing it, you go on tour.
01:55:52.12 --> 01:55:55.24 And just before we go on tour, you break up with girl at the time.
01:55:55.24 --> 01:55:59.16 Yeah, blah, blah, blah.
01:55:59.16 --> 01:56:01.68 Back to the book without the feeling of being needed.
01:56:01.68 --> 01:56:03.92 I didn't feel, I had much purpose in my life.
01:56:03.92 --> 01:56:08.92 I started falling back into fuck up mode. I was seeing several different chicks around
01:56:08.92 --> 01:56:09.92 at that time.
01:56:09.92 --> 01:56:11.92 Actually, what, so I don't have to rip it.
01:56:11.92 --> 01:56:12.92 Hey, who wrote the book?
01:56:12.92 --> 01:56:13.92 Yeah, I'm not sure.
01:56:13.92 --> 01:56:14.92 I'm correct.
01:56:14.92 --> 01:56:15.92 No, no, no, I'm correct.
01:56:15.92 --> 01:56:16.92 You.
01:56:16.92 --> 01:56:20.92 No, no, it wasn't even so much over just a breakup of a chick.
01:56:20.92 --> 01:56:24.92 I was actually, I've been with this chick for a while and she had a daughter and I had raised her
01:56:24.92 --> 01:56:25.92 daughter.
01:56:25.92 --> 01:56:31.92 So it was like, you know, also not just feeling like betrayed and everything else that goes along with a breakup,
01:56:31.92 --> 01:56:39.92 but as any father or stepfather, stepmother, you know, you have a certain, you know, you
01:56:39.92 --> 01:56:42.92 develop love for a kid even if it's not yours.
01:56:42.92 --> 01:56:47.92 You know, and that was really what was hard on me more than anything.
01:56:47.92 --> 01:56:53.92 Because the mother was all fucked up on drugs and I had actually taken the kid from her and I was raising the kid for her
01:56:53.92 --> 01:56:57.92 while she was off just being a fuck up.
01:56:57.92 --> 01:57:01.92 And then the grandparents and me got in contact.
01:57:01.92 --> 01:57:04.92 So I wound up doing, you know, what you do.
01:57:04.92 --> 01:57:07.92 This is your family, this is your blood that you got to grow up with your family.
01:57:07.92 --> 01:57:10.92 So that was, that's why I was struggling.
01:57:10.92 --> 01:57:18.92 You know, it was because it was like, you know, I was, I never had a father that gave a fuck about me.
01:57:18.92 --> 01:57:25.92 So every time I've been in a child's life, it is really mattered to me.
01:57:25.92 --> 01:57:33.92 You like to be, to protect them because no one protected me, you know.
01:57:33.92 --> 01:57:41.92 So that was why I really started to lose my way again, you know, because I was like, you know,
01:57:41.92 --> 01:57:49.92 I don't have a purpose, there's no one for me to love, no one for me to care about and no one to feel.
01:57:49.92 --> 01:57:54.92 My love, you know.
01:57:54.92 --> 01:58:05.92 So yeah, the drugs started to fill in the gap again, you know, but fortunately that didn't last forever.
01:58:05.92 --> 01:58:06.92 It's funny, man.
01:58:06.92 --> 01:58:12.92 Some of the toughest motherfuckers actually got the biggest hearts and that's what a lot of people don't realize is, you know,
01:58:12.92 --> 01:58:18.92 I'm sure that underneath this rugged exterior, you're quite a sensitive motherfucker.
01:58:18.92 --> 01:58:20.92 You know, and, you're talking about me.
01:58:20.92 --> 01:58:25.92 I'm talking about the guy behind you.
01:58:25.92 --> 01:58:34.92 But, you know, I mean, seriously, some of the most elist motherfuckers I've known in my life have been some of the most sensitive people on the inside.
01:58:34.92 --> 01:58:46.92 And I think that part of that illness has been a shield, you know, to protect themselves.
01:58:46.92 --> 01:58:56.92 I know, and it probably was with me in a lot of ways, you know, if I wasn't as violent as I was, my neighborhood would have devoured me.
01:58:56.92 --> 01:59:04.92 My environment would have devoured me if I wasn't as, yeah, so to your point, I agree with you.
01:59:04.92 --> 01:59:13.92 And that's one of the reasons why I think going back to the Gitu, or boxing or wrestling or moi tie.
01:59:13.92 --> 01:59:23.92 But when you, me, when we're kids, young men, going back to the whole thing about proving yourself, how you can prove yourself that you're tough.
01:59:23.92 --> 01:59:26.92 When you're a kid, you go out and you fight and you beat people up.
01:59:26.92 --> 01:59:27.92 You do stupid shit.
01:59:27.92 --> 01:59:28.92 Do stupid stuff.
01:59:28.92 --> 01:59:31.92 When you do Gitu, you know you're tough.
01:59:31.92 --> 01:59:37.92 And you know, when you look at some guy in the street, like, hey, that guy might stab me, but if he doesn't, I'm going to, I will choke him out and take me 15 seconds.
01:59:37.92 --> 01:59:47.92 So I don't have to do anything to prove that's why I think it's for me. And I think it was Tim Ferris asked me this question. He's like, what makes a man or something like that?
01:59:47.92 --> 02:00:01.92 And I was like, to your point, for me, learning how to fight. So learn in Gitu, getting married and having kids and going into combat.
02:00:01.92 --> 02:00:07.92 Those were the three things that I was like, okay, those three things, they were evolutionary to me.
02:00:07.92 --> 02:00:13.92 And they were the three things that happened where I said, okay, I don't have to walk around trying to prove myself to this guy or that guy.
02:00:13.92 --> 02:00:15.92 I know how to fight.
02:00:15.92 --> 02:00:19.92 I don't even need to impress that girl over there. I got a girl.
02:00:19.92 --> 02:00:24.92 You know, and I got, and I got mouths to feed so I can't act like an idiot.
02:00:24.92 --> 02:00:26.92 And I know I'm not a coward.
02:00:26.92 --> 02:00:32.92 And if shit goes down, I know that I will do the right thing. I know that 100%.
02:00:32.92 --> 02:00:35.92 So those were the things that, to me, gave me like security as a man.
02:00:35.92 --> 02:00:38.92 And so it's the same thing that you're saying.
02:00:38.92 --> 02:00:47.92 You know, when we're young and you're out there just to try and prove and protect and shield your emotion.
02:00:47.92 --> 02:00:48.92 You sense it too.
02:00:48.92 --> 02:00:50.92 Yeah, that's what you do.
02:00:50.92 --> 02:00:55.92 And so a good way to get over that, in my opinion, instead of having to fake it, you learn it for real.
02:00:55.92 --> 02:00:58.92 Well, I wish I would have had you, Jitsu when I was young kid.
02:00:58.92 --> 02:01:00.92 That would have helped me immensely.
02:01:00.92 --> 02:01:01.92 Yeah.
02:01:01.92 --> 02:01:06.92 Well, I mean, just one person I'll just mention briefly is,
02:01:06.92 --> 02:01:09.92 Hi, I'm Gracie.
02:01:09.92 --> 02:01:19.92 Another brother that I truly loved and, you know, he died in 2007.
02:01:19.92 --> 02:01:29.92 He was a very tragic and here's a guy who was feared by 99.9% of the people that knew him.
02:01:29.92 --> 02:01:33.92 And the 1% of the people that knew him fucking loved him.
02:01:33.92 --> 02:01:40.92 And he was, you know, it's like, I'm saying, you know, you got these people who are fucking dangerous motherfuckers.
02:01:40.92 --> 02:01:45.92 You don't even want to look at them wrong or for too long.
02:01:45.92 --> 02:01:50.92 Yeah. But if they fucking love you, man, nobody better fuck with you ever.
02:01:50.92 --> 02:01:53.92 No, then you got a part in the book where you're talking about. He came home. We fought in Japan.
02:01:53.92 --> 02:01:54.92 Yeah.
02:01:54.92 --> 02:01:56.92 Come home. He gives you, you know, you just had your first game.
02:01:56.92 --> 02:01:57.92 It gives you two grand.
02:01:57.92 --> 02:01:58.92 Yeah.
02:01:58.92 --> 02:02:00.92 If we're not for nothing, just for being you.
02:02:00.92 --> 02:02:04.92 And I didn't want to take it and he's like, shut the fuck up.
02:02:04.92 --> 02:02:06.92 It's for the baby.
02:02:06.92 --> 02:02:11.92 You know, I mean, I know my other fuck is my whole life.
02:02:11.92 --> 02:02:17.92 You know, Dean Deen Lister, who's one of my parents and training partners and all that.
02:02:17.92 --> 02:02:20.92 But he's got some funny stories about a high end.
02:02:20.92 --> 02:02:22.92 And he's like, high end was fucking crazy.
02:02:22.92 --> 02:02:23.92 Yeah.
02:02:23.92 --> 02:02:25.92 He was a crazy motherfucker.
02:02:25.92 --> 02:02:34.92 But to be honest though, I never had any crazy experiences with him because I feel like when he looked into my eyes, he knew he didn't have to prove anything to me.
02:02:34.92 --> 02:02:37.92 Yeah. You guys kind of counter now.
02:02:37.92 --> 02:02:38.92 What's that?
02:02:38.92 --> 02:02:39.92 Yeah.
02:02:39.92 --> 02:02:41.92 You know, it's kind of totally true.
02:02:41.92 --> 02:02:44.92 Well, it was like, you know, I don't have to prove I'm a bad S to you.
02:02:44.92 --> 02:02:46.92 You don't have to prove you're a bad S to me.
02:02:46.92 --> 02:02:47.92 Let's just go out and chill.
02:02:47.92 --> 02:02:48.92 That's good.
02:02:48.92 --> 02:02:50.92 You know, we'd go out and like go to stupid movies.
02:02:50.92 --> 02:02:55.92 Like, you know, go out and just work on his English.
02:02:55.92 --> 02:02:58.92 You know, like, I'd never, you know,
02:02:58.92 --> 02:03:04.92 Yeah, we had fun, you know, but we never like gotten brawls and got, you know, right.
02:03:04.92 --> 02:03:06.92 But I mean, you know, he died.
02:03:06.92 --> 02:03:08.92 Yeah, he got, he got a rest.
02:03:08.92 --> 02:03:10.92 He was a bad S to me.
02:03:10.92 --> 02:03:11.92 He was a bad S to me.
02:03:11.92 --> 02:03:16.92 But, you know, again, it's like, you know, again, this is somebody who's very emotional.
02:03:16.92 --> 02:03:26.92 And sadly, you know, like many people started using drugs as a way to deal with shit.
02:03:26.92 --> 02:03:31.92 I guess I don't want to say to deal with shit, but maybe just as a little bit of an escape.
02:03:31.92 --> 02:03:35.92 You know, you got to figure what kind of fucking, you know,
02:03:35.92 --> 02:03:38.92 I mean, his favorite song was a boy named Sue by Johnny Cash.
02:03:38.92 --> 02:03:43.92 And he really felt like he was living that life by being him, you know, with the name Gracie
02:03:43.92 --> 02:03:48.92 and having to be, you know, always having to step up, always having to prove himself
02:03:48.92 --> 02:03:50.92 and always having to be a bad S.
02:03:50.92 --> 02:03:55.92 And I think that when you're forced to react and deal with things on that level all the time
02:03:55.92 --> 02:04:02.92 and especially when you are actually a nice person at heart or a sensitive person at heart
02:04:02.92 --> 02:04:07.92 when you're forced to always take that stance, that shit's a fucking tough one.
02:04:07.92 --> 02:04:10.92 And, you know, that's a hard road to travel.
02:04:10.92 --> 02:04:13.92 And, you know, I always have him with me.
02:04:13.92 --> 02:04:18.92 I always have him sitting on one shoulder and hands on sitting on the other.
02:04:18.92 --> 02:04:25.92 And, you know, when I get back on it, yeah, when I have big, when I am confronted by a serious shit,
02:04:25.92 --> 02:04:36.92 I think about, you know, how one would react and how the other would react and then I try to find my own sense in there.
02:04:36.92 --> 02:04:42.92 Yeah, I mean, it's high in this kind of a classic example of everything that we're talking about.
02:04:42.92 --> 02:04:46.92 Yeah, for all, for all, practical purposes, you shouldn't be here right now.
02:04:46.92 --> 02:04:48.92 You shouldn't be here either dead or in jail or whatever.
02:04:48.92 --> 02:04:49.92 Yeah.
02:04:49.92 --> 02:04:50.92 And he did some shit.
02:04:50.92 --> 02:04:53.92 That was going down the same path, but he didn't make that.
02:04:53.92 --> 02:04:57.92 You know, and that's, you know, that's the thing, man.
02:04:57.92 --> 02:05:08.92 I feel really fortunate that I had music because I think that it gave me a tool to give me a paddle to row my way through the shit.
02:05:08.92 --> 02:05:11.92 But it also came with its own load of shit.
02:05:11.92 --> 02:05:17.92 You know, it's funny because, you know, I probably should have encouraged my kids to learn more about music and be more musical.
02:05:17.92 --> 02:05:22.92 But I encourage them to be judicits who guys because I felt that, you know,
02:05:22.92 --> 02:05:24.92 and then he's way safer.
02:05:24.92 --> 02:05:26.92 He's gonna use his head to be better.
02:05:26.92 --> 02:05:28.92 It's less off-road.
02:05:28.92 --> 02:05:30.92 Yeah, that's about exit.
02:05:30.92 --> 02:05:35.92 You know, you might get punching your face at Buds of Times, but at least you won't, you know, at least you won't be life punching you in your face.
02:05:35.92 --> 02:05:36.92 Yeah, damn.
02:05:36.92 --> 02:05:37.92 You know.
02:05:37.92 --> 02:05:43.92 And there's, you know, all kinds of drama around it, you describe it again as spinal tap.
02:05:43.92 --> 02:05:46.92 You know, just the rock and roll crap.
02:05:46.92 --> 02:05:53.92 Cromags comes to an end for the most part, and you end up putting out a record hardly's war.
02:05:53.92 --> 02:05:54.92 Yeah.
02:05:54.92 --> 02:06:00.92 And, um, good, good rock and roll music, baby.
02:06:00.92 --> 02:06:07.92 And now, and also during that time, you, you had some kids.
02:06:07.92 --> 02:06:08.92 Yeah.
02:06:08.92 --> 02:06:11.92 And, you know, you met the mother of your kids.
02:06:11.92 --> 02:06:14.92 And she wanted to go to school.
02:06:14.92 --> 02:06:30.92 And so you took off some time to just, yeah, I, I pretty much put my musical career on, uh, hold, you know, to take care of your kids.
02:06:30.92 --> 02:06:31.92 Yeah.
02:06:31.92 --> 02:06:38.92 And, uh, you know, one of the, one of the paragraphs that you wrote in here is awesome.
02:06:38.92 --> 02:06:45.92 Um, talking about your kids and you say, and this is something I completely related to.
02:06:45.92 --> 02:06:49.92 I'll tell you the first time I looked down at the other end of the mat and saw my boys training.
02:06:49.92 --> 02:06:51.92 There was one of the greatest moments in my life.
02:06:51.92 --> 02:06:56.92 My youngest son spent his birthday at the academy with George St. Pierre and all the rest of the fellas.
02:06:56.92 --> 02:07:03.92 My eldest son had his birthday there with all the graces and about 30 kids, a full house and a cake with a hands-o-grace of your academy logo on it.
02:07:03.92 --> 02:07:12.92 My sons have grown up with hands-o-like and uncle, Igor Hall's, Gregor, Daniel, Neiman, all the guys treat my boys like family.
02:07:12.92 --> 02:07:16.92 They've known their instructor, Magnogama, since birth.
02:07:16.92 --> 02:07:23.92 He came to the hospital to see them hours after they were born and hands-o, they have known since they were days old.
02:07:23.92 --> 02:07:30.92 My eldest son, I have been on gray, howl and buses in the middle of the night, traveling hours away to represent RGA and team, and so greasy.
02:07:30.92 --> 02:07:39.92 I have competed with my sons at National Enranct, grappling submission and GJ, one of my proudest moments was when we both competed at the same event.
02:07:39.92 --> 02:07:49.92 My son took first place in his division and I took second place in the expert master's division in the 30 to 35 year old age bracket, although I was 44.
02:07:49.92 --> 02:08:02.92 Hands-o-joked when he first saw my son, this is the proof that even though the fruit is rotten, the seed can still be good.
02:08:02.92 --> 02:08:06.92 Yeah, we all know that one.
02:08:06.92 --> 02:08:14.92 I guess it's when you see your kid doing anything that you love doing, and you see get to see your kid do it echo, you got that in your future.
02:08:14.92 --> 02:08:20.92 When you see your kid, oh, you see your daughter on the mat right now, and that's cool.
02:08:20.92 --> 02:08:31.92 When you see your kid training, and I'm to the point right now, my son's a big kid, he's 14, but I can roll with him, and I can legit roll with him.
02:08:31.92 --> 02:08:32.92 He's taller than me.
02:08:32.92 --> 02:08:35.92 He's 14 years, six foot, but 80.
02:08:35.92 --> 02:08:38.92 Yeah, I was even hooked on me.
02:08:38.92 --> 02:08:52.92 Yeah, and it's awesome when you get to train, and you know the other thing I noticed, I surf and when my son, as good as it feels to surf, like as good, there's a really good feeling you surf.
02:08:52.92 --> 02:09:07.92 As good as that feels, it feels just as good, if not better to be paddling back out after catching away, even see my son just just, just getting after it, it's so awesome.
02:09:07.92 --> 02:09:17.92 It's like, you know, I'll just like, watch him and you try not to like contain yourself, but it's so awesome.
02:09:17.92 --> 02:09:19.92 It's so cool.
02:09:19.92 --> 02:09:26.92 And you know, you see, and I got a bunch of daughters to and seeing them do when they, basically when you see your kids kicking ass, it's stuff, man.
02:09:26.92 --> 02:09:27.92 It's nice.
02:09:27.92 --> 02:09:34.92 And it makes you feel fucking good, you know, and you see them doing positive shifts, especially man, because God knows, I mean, I've done so much negative shit.
02:09:34.92 --> 02:09:39.92 When I see my kids doing something positive, it's gonna feel really good, you know.
02:09:39.92 --> 02:09:48.92 Going back to the book, talking about your dad, my dad, my father died from a fire.
02:09:48.92 --> 02:09:55.92 So your father, and we didn't talk about him much, he'd gone away, and then he'd like had intermittent contact with you over the years.
02:09:55.92 --> 02:10:02.92 Well, actually, once he was out of my life, I, you know, my mom left him when I was really young, you know.
02:10:02.92 --> 02:10:07.92 I never saw him again, and I only actually spoke to him twice on the phone.
02:10:07.92 --> 02:10:19.92 I got like one letter from him, and it was like one or two pages and a cassette of him playing guitar in a halfway house.
02:10:19.92 --> 02:10:25.92 And basically, it's apologizing a lot.
02:10:25.92 --> 02:10:54.92 And, yeah, you know, he knew he made a lot of bad choices, but it's fucked up though, because, you know, I mean, he was all, you know, he's fucked up on heroin, and he was in alcoholic, and he actually, like, kicked my mother in the stomach when she was just like very pregnant with me.
02:10:54.92 --> 02:11:02.92 You know, and, you know, yeah, that's how much he didn't want me.
02:11:02.92 --> 02:11:16.92 So, you know, it's a, it's a hard bill of swall, you know, when your father would rather be strong on heroin than be your father.
02:11:16.92 --> 02:11:29.92 But, but I've managed to turn it around, you know, because I love being with not just my kids, but I teach the kids at the Hands of Gracie Academy.
02:11:29.92 --> 02:11:42.92 And so the child that I didn't really have, I get to experience and live my cariously through all these other kids, and I get to be a role model to them, where as I didn't have any.
02:11:42.92 --> 02:11:54.92 And, you know, I'm teaching these little boys and little girls how to defend themselves and how to fight and how to fight and have honor and how to lose with honor.
02:11:54.92 --> 02:12:06.92 And, always to shake their opponents hand and say, good job, whether they win or whether they lose and how to have that respect for their opponent as well as themselves.
02:12:06.92 --> 02:12:15.92 You know, when I teach these kids that, you know, they're like they say in jujitsu, there's no losing in jujitsu, you win or you learn.
02:12:15.92 --> 02:12:31.92 And when I can take a kid who, you know, I've worked with a lot of kids who have, you know, varying degrees of spectrum disorders, whether they've autism or physical issues.
02:12:31.92 --> 02:12:44.92 And to see the improvement that they make, not just at jujitsu, but in their social skills, you know, kids who are so insecure that they won't look at you.
02:12:44.92 --> 02:12:47.92 And now they're making eye contact with you talking to you.
02:12:47.92 --> 02:12:54.92 To like change your face and shaking your hand and their chest is out, your shoulders are back and they're not all.
02:12:54.92 --> 02:13:07.92 You know, that, you know, so where I didn't have certain things, you know, at the end of the day it gave me something else.
02:13:07.92 --> 02:13:16.92 It gave me the ability to value that, that relationship that you can have with children and a lot of people take for granted a lot of.
02:13:16.92 --> 02:13:26.92 And you get disappointed with a lot of the parents that bring their kids to jujitsu because I feel like, you know, you're a lot of people hand their kids off to everybody else to teach them how to do everything.
02:13:26.92 --> 02:13:31.92 You know, they don't work on stuff at home with them, they don't sit there and then teach them, they don't.
02:13:31.92 --> 02:13:37.92 I get, you know, when you have a kid that doesn't know how to do a fucking jumping jack, you're like, what the fuck.
02:13:37.92 --> 02:13:48.92 The, your parents do it you, they don't roll around with you, they don't teach you how to do a summer saw, I have to teach you which is your left and your right hand, like really, you know.
02:13:48.92 --> 02:14:03.92 I don't think people value that time enough and I have said it before it's like, you know, your job made your career may change several times in your life, your spouse may not be your spouse for it, but your kids are always going to be your kids.
02:14:03.92 --> 02:14:11.92 You really have to cherish and value that and the time that you spend with them because they'll always be your kids.
02:14:11.92 --> 02:14:19.92 And that woman that you think you're in love with may leave you, you may fall out of love.
02:14:19.92 --> 02:14:32.92 Your job may, you know, fold, but your kids, you're going to be your kids forever and they'll always need you, even if it's just emotionally to know that you're there.
02:14:32.92 --> 02:14:47.92 Even if they're not seeing you every year or every six months or even if you don't speak to them, they, you know, you still have to be an emotional and spiritual backbone even from afar.
02:14:47.92 --> 02:14:53.92 You know, I mean, I, you know, I forgive you, dad.
02:14:53.92 --> 02:15:06.92 Yeah, you, uh, when he died, you actually flew down to Texas to, you know, basically to bury him.
02:15:06.92 --> 02:15:10.92 And that, that was cool too.
02:15:10.92 --> 02:15:15.92 I got finally meet his mother and learn about my father side of the family.
02:15:15.92 --> 02:15:18.92 So there was some closure in that.
02:15:18.92 --> 02:15:23.92 But I buried him myself. I wouldn't let anybody throw dirt on top of him.
02:15:23.92 --> 02:15:37.92 And, uh, and as it turned out, I wound up buried my mom too with my, with my youngest son.
02:15:37.92 --> 02:15:51.92 You're, um, you're now, you were kind of wrapping up this book when you were writing it.
02:15:51.92 --> 02:15:55.92 And, and you know, you kind of closed it out.
02:15:55.92 --> 02:16:02.92 And when you closed it out, you, you said this at the end of the book.
02:16:02.92 --> 02:16:08.92 I guess part of being a father is learning how to eat a certain amount of shit. You do it for your kids, because they need you.
02:16:08.92 --> 02:16:14.92 You just throw a little on a little salt and pepper and maybe some to basketball and smile, because you got to be there for them.
02:16:14.92 --> 02:16:20.92 One thing my father said was, I've got all these years of experience experiences that I don't know what to do with.
02:16:20.92 --> 02:16:23.92 And that's kind of how I feel with my boys.
02:16:23.92 --> 02:16:28.92 How do I come in for a graceful landing after so much fucking turbulence in my life?
02:16:28.92 --> 02:16:34.92 Hopefully I can guide them better than I was guided or at least maybe they will learn from my mistakes.
02:16:34.92 --> 02:16:39.92 God knows I've made enough for everybody.
02:16:39.92 --> 02:16:46.92 And if I remember correctly, that was the kind of the end of the book.
02:16:46.92 --> 02:16:50.92 And then you were moving on and then, and then,
02:16:50.92 --> 02:16:53.92 2012 comes along.
02:16:53.92 --> 02:16:57.92 And there's like a hardcore fest.
02:16:57.92 --> 02:17:00.92 You know, they're kind of bringing back like, I don't know if it's like a reunion fest,
02:17:00.92 --> 02:17:02.92 bringing back a bunch of old bands.
02:17:02.92 --> 02:17:10.92 And the Chrome Max, I should say a formation of the Chrome Max or members of the Chrome Max.
02:17:10.92 --> 02:17:12.92 So I'm saying you can just call it the faux Max.
02:17:12.92 --> 02:17:13.92 Let's just keep it real man.
02:17:13.92 --> 02:17:19.92 They were going to play a fake ass band that does my songs with one of the old members.
02:17:19.92 --> 02:17:21.92 And they were going to play.
02:17:21.92 --> 02:17:22.92 Yes.
02:17:22.92 --> 02:17:27.92 And you were like, okay, you know, I'm going to go check it out.
02:17:27.92 --> 02:17:29.92 And you know what, I'll bring my base maybe get on stage.
02:17:29.92 --> 02:17:33.92 But you know what, there was actually two members of the original group playing that night.
02:17:33.92 --> 02:17:42.92 And my intention was to go and to extend my hand and say, you know what guys, I, I, I love you guys.
02:17:42.92 --> 02:17:45.92 As much as I hate you, I love you.
02:17:45.92 --> 02:17:49.92 You know, and just because I like to think that the end of the day,
02:17:49.92 --> 02:17:54.92 two people that were friends can laugh at their own foolishness, you know,
02:17:54.92 --> 02:18:03.92 I would like to think that people are able to look beyond their egos and, and forgive each other for being idiots.
02:18:03.92 --> 02:18:07.92 Because God knows we all are at times.
02:18:07.92 --> 02:18:15.92 So yeah, I went to that show with the hope of maybe even being invited up on stage to play a few songs with them.
02:18:15.92 --> 02:18:18.92 And, well, the rest is history.
02:18:18.92 --> 02:18:21.92 Yeah, you show up and, and here you go.
02:18:21.92 --> 02:18:25.92 You're walking through the place you go to the, you get invited up the dressing room.
02:18:25.92 --> 02:18:26.92 Hey, come say hi.
02:18:26.92 --> 02:18:28.92 And then here we go back to the book.
02:18:28.92 --> 02:18:31.92 As soon as I walked in, I literally walked into the room took two steps, the door shut,
02:18:31.92 --> 02:18:33.92 and I got punched from behind.
02:18:33.92 --> 02:18:36.92 Out of the corner, I, my eye, I could see was some big dude with tattoos.
02:18:36.92 --> 02:18:38.92 It was like bam, he hit me hard.
02:18:38.92 --> 02:18:43.92 I saw a bit of a flash bulb like you see when you get hit out of nowhere and you don't expect it.
02:18:43.92 --> 02:18:47.92 And then it was a reign of fists and kicks that were coming from every direction of the room.
02:18:47.92 --> 02:18:48.92 And this was a small room.
02:18:48.92 --> 02:18:49.92 It's a dressing room.
02:18:49.92 --> 02:18:50.92 And I started falling forward.
02:18:50.92 --> 02:18:54.92 I fell onto the couch and rolled onto my back and started throwing up kicks just instinctively
02:18:54.92 --> 02:18:56.92 to get people off me.
02:18:56.92 --> 02:18:59.92 I was getting jump by at least four or five guys probably more.
02:18:59.92 --> 02:19:01.92 There was a bunch of people in the room.
02:19:01.92 --> 02:19:06.92 I think I counted seven or eight, although I couldn't even really count in all the chaos.
02:19:06.92 --> 02:19:08.92 At that point, I reached into my pocket.
02:19:08.92 --> 02:19:09.92 I had a little knife.
02:19:09.92 --> 02:19:10.92 I pulled it out.
02:19:10.92 --> 02:19:12.92 And it still had a cheeton.
02:19:12.92 --> 02:19:16.92 So I just tried to punch the first person that was in front of me and get them the fuck off me.
02:19:16.92 --> 02:19:18.92 Everybody started screaming.
02:19:18.92 --> 02:19:23.92 I saw the door of the dressing room open and I started yelling security security.
02:19:23.92 --> 02:19:25.92 And then I left.
02:19:25.92 --> 02:19:28.92 And then I saw somebody pull the door shut.
02:19:28.92 --> 02:19:30.92 And I thought to myself, fuck these dudes.
02:19:30.92 --> 02:19:33.92 Their intention is to fuck me up and then I want no one to see it.
02:19:33.92 --> 02:19:35.92 They're trying to beat this shit out of me.
02:19:35.92 --> 02:19:40.92 And I've seen all these dudes in a pack kicking people to the point where their brains don't
02:19:40.92 --> 02:19:41.92 fucking work.
02:19:41.92 --> 02:19:45.92 And I knew right then if I didn't get the fuck out of that situation, I was not going to make it
02:19:45.92 --> 02:19:46.92 home in one piece.
02:19:46.92 --> 02:19:52.92 So I started flailing the knife as fiercely as I could just to get myself the fuck out of that situation
02:19:52.92 --> 02:19:55.92 and toward the door.
02:19:55.92 --> 02:19:56.92 Everybody screaming.
02:19:56.92 --> 02:19:57.92 He's got a knife.
02:19:57.92 --> 02:19:58.92 He's got a knife.
02:19:58.92 --> 02:20:01.92 And I don't even know who it was or how they ended up in my face.
02:20:01.92 --> 02:20:03.92 I guess it was when they were lunging in my arm.
02:20:03.92 --> 02:20:05.92 I bit whoever wasn't front of my face.
02:20:05.92 --> 02:20:07.92 I tore a big piece out of his cheek.
02:20:07.92 --> 02:20:09.92 It was obvious it was a setup.
02:20:09.92 --> 02:20:12.92 When I saw the door pulled shut, I was fighting for my life.
02:20:12.92 --> 02:20:16.92 These guys wanted to kick the shit out of me, stomped me out and no one would see it.
02:20:16.92 --> 02:20:20.92 There would be no whist witnesses and that would be that.
02:20:20.92 --> 02:20:22.92 But that shit was not going down.
02:20:22.92 --> 02:20:23.92 I bet the one guy's face.
02:20:23.92 --> 02:20:25.92 I just tore his fucking cheek open right below his eye.
02:20:25.92 --> 02:20:27.92 He was screaming blood was running down.
02:20:27.92 --> 02:20:29.92 His face I bit someone's wrist.
02:20:29.92 --> 02:20:31.92 As they were trying to get the knife out of my hand.
02:20:31.92 --> 02:20:32.92 I just didn't bite it.
02:20:32.92 --> 02:20:34.92 I tried to tear a piece out.
02:20:34.92 --> 02:20:36.92 That's in the bouncer's broken to the room.
02:20:36.92 --> 02:20:41.92 At this point, I was on the bottom of a pile trying to stab and kick and everybody started trying to grab my hand.
02:20:41.92 --> 02:20:44.92 They're like, give me the knife, give me the knife on security.
02:20:44.92 --> 02:20:47.92 I ended up getting dragged out onto the balcony, getting kicked.
02:20:47.92 --> 02:20:52.92 I got one good kick and I write face and I'm surprised it did knock my teeth out.
02:20:52.92 --> 02:20:56.92 One dude's scream, get on your stomach, get on your stomach, put your hands out and front of you.
02:20:56.92 --> 02:21:02.92 This one big guy stepped on my back with both of his feet and another guy was looking at my face and squeezing my throat.
02:21:02.92 --> 02:21:04.92 I don't know who the fuck was.
02:21:04.92 --> 02:21:07.92 One guy looked at me and said, mother fucker, I'll kill you.
02:21:07.92 --> 02:21:08.92 I'll kill you.
02:21:08.92 --> 02:21:12.92 I will kick you in your fucking face until you are dead mother fucker if you don't stop moving.
02:21:12.92 --> 02:21:17.92 I saw a peek from sick of it all in the crowd of people next to us with a freaked out look on his face.
02:21:17.92 --> 02:21:21.92 He was gesturing with his hands from you to calm down and stop resisting.
02:21:21.92 --> 02:21:24.92 You kept mouthing the words, hardly chill, hardly.
02:21:24.92 --> 02:21:26.92 Please stop, chill, hardly.
02:21:26.92 --> 02:21:28.92 That's in one guy said, put your hands out and front of you.
02:21:28.92 --> 02:21:31.92 I asked her, you a cop, he was like, yeah, so I said, show me your badge.
02:21:31.92 --> 02:21:35.92 And at that point, the boys in blue came running up the stairs.
02:21:35.92 --> 02:21:37.92 I was like, fine, I'm not moving anymore.
02:21:37.92 --> 02:21:41.92 I stopped my hands out and front of me, face down on the floor.
02:21:41.92 --> 02:21:43.92 I still didn't know that I've been stabbed.
02:21:43.92 --> 02:21:44.92 I got 40 stitches in my leg.
02:21:44.92 --> 02:21:46.92 Thank God, it was in my leg.
02:21:46.92 --> 02:21:51.92 Only the cops cuffed me, turned me over and that's when I saw the wound in my leg.
02:21:51.92 --> 02:21:52.92 It was a grotesque.
02:21:52.92 --> 02:21:54.92 The blood was bubbling out of it.
02:21:54.92 --> 02:21:57.92 The fashion tendons were literally hanging out of my leg.
02:21:57.92 --> 02:22:00.92 That's why people started saying that it was a compound fracture.
02:22:00.92 --> 02:22:01.92 The cops cuffed me.
02:22:01.92 --> 02:22:05.92 They put me on a chair, carried me down the stairs and put me in the ambulance.
02:22:05.92 --> 02:22:12.92 It wasn't until I got cleaned up in the ambulance that they realized it was a stab wound.
02:22:12.92 --> 02:22:16.92 That was fun, man.
02:22:16.92 --> 02:22:19.92 So, and you kind of already talked about this.
02:22:19.92 --> 02:22:21.92 I mean, they basically arrest you immediately.
02:22:21.92 --> 02:22:23.92 Yes, total melee.
02:22:23.92 --> 02:22:24.92 Yeah.
02:22:24.92 --> 02:22:28.92 And I actually, when I got arrested, I thought we were all going to get arrested.
02:22:28.92 --> 02:22:30.92 And there was this going to be like a bar fight.
02:22:30.92 --> 02:22:31.92 Everybody got pulled in.
02:22:31.92 --> 02:22:41.92 All these fucking guys started making statements that were basically that I've launched into the room and started just stabbing people.
02:22:41.92 --> 02:22:45.92 So, you know, you got a room full of people saying he didn't, he didn't, he didn't, he didn't, he didn't.
02:22:45.92 --> 02:22:47.92 And you got one amazing thing.
02:22:47.92 --> 02:22:48.92 What the fuck happened?
02:22:48.92 --> 02:22:51.92 And the fuck you think is going to get walked out in the cuffs.
02:22:51.92 --> 02:22:52.92 Yeah.
02:22:52.92 --> 02:22:55.92 And you end up on rikers.
02:22:55.92 --> 02:22:56.92 Yeah.
02:22:56.92 --> 02:23:00.92 Rikers island for those of you who don't know from around the world is jail.
02:23:00.92 --> 02:23:02.92 New York, jail.
02:23:02.92 --> 02:23:03.92 Rikers island.
02:23:03.92 --> 02:23:17.92 And meanwhile, the media, you know, is putting out all these, the version that's get told to the media, which is that you instigated it and you are a horrible person, etc.
02:23:17.92 --> 02:23:19.92 And now you got it rikers island.
02:23:19.92 --> 02:23:23.92 Going back to the book, all night you'd hear people screaming and talking shit.
02:23:23.92 --> 02:23:26.92 The youth offenders were in the same building as us right next door.
02:23:26.92 --> 02:23:31.92 So all night you'd hear them screaming, suck my dick, mother fucker off fuck you up, suck my dick.
02:23:31.92 --> 02:23:33.92 It was fun.
02:23:33.92 --> 02:23:33.92 It was fun.
02:23:33.92 --> 02:23:33.92 It was fun.
02:23:33.92 --> 02:23:35.92 Fuck you, stop, fuck.
02:23:35.92 --> 02:23:36.92 All night, fuck.
02:23:36.92 --> 02:23:36.92 All night, fuck.
02:23:36.92 --> 02:23:37.92 It was fun.
02:23:37.92 --> 02:23:38.92 It was fun.
02:23:38.92 --> 02:23:40.92 I just fucking cry, sir.
02:23:40.92 --> 02:23:43.92 Riot cops came in all the, all fucking night.
02:23:43.92 --> 02:23:48.92 Then as soon as the sun would start coming up and they'd finally shut up, the seagulls would start making noise.
02:23:48.92 --> 02:23:49.92 It was nonstop.
02:23:49.92 --> 02:23:52.92 Ironically, it was the best sleep I'd gotten in a while.
02:23:52.92 --> 02:23:55.92 Ever since I started going through the bullshit with my ex.
02:23:55.92 --> 02:23:59.92 My life had truly become a nightmare.
02:23:59.92 --> 02:24:04.92 I remember at one point I was looking out through my window through the gates.
02:24:04.92 --> 02:24:09.92 It was a beautiful sunny day and I could hear the birds and a butterfly flew past my window.
02:24:09.92 --> 02:24:11.92 And I was like damn.
02:24:11.92 --> 02:24:15.92 Right then, and there that butterfly represented freedom.
02:24:15.92 --> 02:24:19.92 What I wouldn't do to be free right then, I had no idea what was going to happen.
02:24:19.92 --> 02:24:24.92 My lawyer told me I was possibly looking at two and a half years in the house.
02:24:24.92 --> 02:24:31.92 I was like, I'm just looking at the birds in jail.
02:24:31.92 --> 02:24:33.92 Rough.
02:24:33.92 --> 02:24:37.92 Yeah, I remember that butterfly, vividly.
02:24:37.92 --> 02:24:40.92 Happy young.
02:24:40.92 --> 02:24:42.92 Get that?
02:24:42.92 --> 02:24:43.92 Yeah.
02:24:43.92 --> 02:24:45.92 You get that?
02:24:45.92 --> 02:24:47.92 I know what I'm about.
02:24:47.92 --> 02:24:48.92 Happy young.
02:24:48.92 --> 02:24:50.92 It's also a different person.
02:24:50.92 --> 02:24:52.92 It was not in France.
02:24:52.92 --> 02:24:54.92 It's like whatever island.
02:24:54.92 --> 02:24:55.92 Yeah, yeah.
02:24:55.92 --> 02:24:56.92 It was a prison island.
02:24:56.92 --> 02:24:57.92 It was a fucking no joke.
02:24:57.92 --> 02:24:58.92 No joke.
02:24:58.92 --> 02:25:00.92 It was a no joke.
02:25:00.92 --> 02:25:03.92 And we always find the good in things.
02:25:03.92 --> 02:25:06.92 And you got a visitor that came to visit you.
02:25:06.92 --> 02:25:08.92 A woman by the name of Laura.
02:25:08.92 --> 02:25:09.92 Yes.
02:25:09.92 --> 02:25:13.92 Who is now goes by the name of Laura Lee Flanagan.
02:25:13.92 --> 02:25:19.92 And she was, she had interviewed you for what, for what website?
02:25:19.92 --> 02:25:26.92 Well, she had a website called NewYorkNatives.com.
02:25:26.92 --> 02:25:32.92 They did a lot of stories about things happening in the city and interesting people in
02:25:32.92 --> 02:25:35.92 this net and blogs and stuff.
02:25:35.92 --> 02:25:43.92 She interviewed me as a native icon because you wouldn't know it from looking at her
02:25:43.92 --> 02:25:45.92 or by her career.
02:25:45.92 --> 02:25:49.92 She's a lawyer, she's, you know, from the Aubrey side.
02:25:49.92 --> 02:25:51.92 She's amazing.
02:25:51.92 --> 02:25:56.92 And she used to be in the hardcore for a brief moment in her childhood.
02:25:56.92 --> 02:26:01.92 So she knew of the Chrome, actually had seen us play.
02:26:01.92 --> 02:26:08.92 And a friend of hers, they were doing, she did a story on C-squat.
02:26:08.92 --> 02:26:10.92 Squat that I used to live in.
02:26:10.92 --> 02:26:13.92 And it was really a good story.
02:26:13.92 --> 02:26:14.92 It was very interesting.
02:26:14.92 --> 02:26:17.92 And one of the people she spoke to around that time, said you should speak to Harley.
02:26:17.92 --> 02:26:23.92 He used to live there and he'd be interesting for you know, for you to interview.
02:26:23.92 --> 02:26:25.92 And she pursued it.
02:26:25.92 --> 02:26:30.92 And we started talking, we did the interview.
02:26:30.92 --> 02:26:37.92 And I started sending her some chapters of this book that I was still working on at the
02:26:37.92 --> 02:26:38.92 time.
02:26:38.92 --> 02:26:44.92 And I don't remember how exactly it came about.
02:26:44.92 --> 02:26:50.92 I mean, she has a PhD and she's done a lot of writing and stuff in her life and a lot of editing
02:26:50.92 --> 02:26:51.92 and stuff.
02:26:51.92 --> 02:26:53.92 And she really enjoyed the book.
02:26:53.92 --> 02:26:55.92 And I needed some help in the editing.
02:26:55.92 --> 02:26:58.92 I mean, I have a seventh grade education.
02:26:58.92 --> 02:27:03.92 So the book was basically one sentence when I gave it to her.
02:27:03.92 --> 02:27:07.92 You know, she gets the award for like editing challenges.
02:27:07.92 --> 02:27:11.92 I mean, it was, it was, it was, it was better tonight.
02:27:11.92 --> 02:27:12.92 I was like, yeah, you edited the book.
02:27:12.92 --> 02:27:14.92 And then we, because I was an English major too.
02:27:14.92 --> 02:27:20.92 And we had a moment of like, I gave her a moment of mutual respect and an ad barration for
02:27:20.92 --> 02:27:21.92 your efforts.
02:27:21.92 --> 02:27:23.92 You don't know how much I would see.
02:27:23.92 --> 02:27:26.92 I mean, this book, okay, it's like 300 pages.
02:27:26.92 --> 02:27:28.92 It would have been a thousand pages.
02:27:28.92 --> 02:27:31.92 And it was like I said, it was one sentence.
02:27:31.92 --> 02:27:36.92 And we literally had to like, okay, we've got 10 stories about fighting now.
02:27:36.92 --> 02:27:38.92 Can we lose these other 20?
02:27:38.92 --> 02:27:42.92 Okay, we've got 10 stories about like almost overdosing.
02:27:42.92 --> 02:27:44.92 Can we lose the other 30?
02:27:44.92 --> 02:27:51.92 Okay, we've got, you know, so it was a, you know, I mean, it would have been a fucking endless book.
02:27:51.92 --> 02:27:56.92 I mean, I took a lot of fights and a lot of drugs and a lot of rock and roll dumbness.
02:27:56.92 --> 02:28:01.92 And just a lot of, actually, good stories didn't make it in, you know.
02:28:01.92 --> 02:28:08.92 But I think I think we got left with a pretty good picture of everything, you know.
02:28:08.92 --> 02:28:14.92 Everybody, it's actually funny because when I had the book signing a lot of people that I went to school with and like
02:28:14.92 --> 02:28:18.92 5, 6 grade from my neighborhood showed up and they were like, dude, you nailed it, man.
02:28:18.92 --> 02:28:21.92 You described the neighborhood so perfectly.
02:28:21.92 --> 02:28:25.92 And the funny shit is actually one of the hitmen, the guys from my block was at my book signing.
02:28:25.92 --> 02:28:30.92 And I actually asked him, I was like, dude, who the fuck was pigman?
02:28:30.92 --> 02:28:35.92 And he's like, oh, man, that was crazy, Eddie.
02:28:35.92 --> 02:28:37.92 And crazy, Eddie was a brand of PCP.
02:28:37.92 --> 02:28:40.92 We always smoke back then, so I'm sure that's why he got the nickname.
02:28:40.92 --> 02:28:48.92 But he's like, man, you know, he's got an auto body shop now, grandkids, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
02:28:48.92 --> 02:28:51.92 Like, where did you know, I'm like, what's on the message itself?
02:28:51.92 --> 02:28:58.92 You know, but it was funny because literally like all that actually mattered more to me than the reviews of the book was
02:28:58.92 --> 02:29:03.92 when I had people who were shared those experiences and people who grew up in the neighborhood.
02:29:03.92 --> 02:29:09.92 I mean, even more so than the Chromex parts of the books like the people who were like, you know, you fucking nailed it, man.
02:29:09.92 --> 02:29:11.92 This is exactly what the city was like.
02:29:11.92 --> 02:29:13.92 I try to tell people all the time and they don't get it.
02:29:13.92 --> 02:29:17.92 So I'm fucked up and I'm copied just so they could fucking see for themselves.
02:29:17.92 --> 02:29:20.92 That was when I knew that I nailed it.
02:29:20.92 --> 02:29:26.92 You know, that was, that was, you know, there was a couple publishers that didn't want to put it out.
02:29:26.92 --> 02:29:28.92 They're like, yeah, we can't touch this.
02:29:28.92 --> 02:29:30.92 Yeah, no, I can imagine.
02:29:30.92 --> 02:29:35.92 Like, hey, you know how, you know, your wife had to lose like 20 to fight stories.
02:29:35.92 --> 02:29:37.92 Yeah, I had to do for this podcast.
02:29:37.92 --> 02:29:41.92 I got ready to, you know, we discussed a fraction of the crazy shit that's out here.
02:29:41.92 --> 02:29:42.92 Yeah, no, I mean, we haven't even touched.
02:29:42.92 --> 02:29:46.92 I mean, we could sit here and talk for the fucking, you know, tomorrow.
02:29:46.92 --> 02:29:52.92 And, you know, but, but I do, you know, I just, the book gets it across.
02:29:52.92 --> 02:29:57.92 And that's why, like I said, I thought I was familiar with the hardcore scene.
02:29:57.92 --> 02:30:00.92 And factually, I mean, I went to CBGBs.
02:30:00.92 --> 02:30:04.92 I don't know, hundreds of times when I was a kid.
02:30:04.92 --> 02:30:07.92 And all shows all over the East Coast, Boston.
02:30:07.92 --> 02:30:08.92 Yeah.
02:30:08.92 --> 02:30:15.92 So, but I still didn't recognize that there was this much chaos.
02:30:15.92 --> 02:30:18.92 And speaking of chaos, I'm going to go back to the book here.
02:30:18.92 --> 02:30:22.92 I'm sitting in jail and here we go because of all the people talking shit and trying to frame me.
02:30:22.92 --> 02:30:26.92 The record label I just signed with was having second thoughts.
02:30:26.92 --> 02:30:29.92 Everything was coming to a head and now I had to prepare for a court date,
02:30:29.92 --> 02:30:36.92 facing four felony counts of second degree assault and weapons charges for biting and stabbing people.
02:30:36.92 --> 02:30:40.92 If there was ever, and I teach the kids.
02:30:40.92 --> 02:30:46.92 If there was ever a time that I was about to lose my shit, I'd have to say it was around this time.
02:30:46.92 --> 02:30:52.92 If there was ever a time someone would relapse into drugs, alcohol or self-destructive shit,
02:30:52.92 --> 02:30:54.92 it was a time like this.
02:30:54.92 --> 02:30:58.92 I actually went out and got drunk a few nights, which I hadn't done in a long time.
02:30:58.92 --> 02:31:00.92 I was really depressed.
02:31:00.92 --> 02:31:02.92 I was really at the bottom.
02:31:02.92 --> 02:31:06.92 I could have easily spun out a control, but I said to myself, fuck that.
02:31:06.92 --> 02:31:14.92 I'm not going to let myself go and do that to myself or my kids or give in and give the satisfaction to my enemies.
02:31:14.92 --> 02:31:16.92 I'm a black belt.
02:31:16.92 --> 02:31:18.92 I have more control than that now.
02:31:18.92 --> 02:31:20.92 I'm not who I once was.
02:31:20.92 --> 02:31:22.92 I'm stronger than that.
02:31:22.92 --> 02:31:26.92 And then.
02:31:26.92 --> 02:31:30.92 The next court date.
02:31:30.92 --> 02:31:32.92 I wound up getting an.
02:31:32.92 --> 02:31:33.92 An adjournment.
02:31:33.92 --> 02:31:37.92 Again, because they didn't have a case against me and again, it got pushed back while the DA
02:31:37.92 --> 02:31:42.92 continued to try and build it until finally in December of 2012.
02:31:42.92 --> 02:31:50.92 They contacted my lawyer and said to appear in court on Friday, December 14th, when the entire case was dismissed.
02:31:50.92 --> 02:31:52.92 Yeah.
02:31:52.92 --> 02:31:54.92 And.
02:31:54.92 --> 02:31:58.92 Yeah.
02:31:58.92 --> 02:31:59.92 You.
02:31:59.92 --> 02:32:02.92 At that point, you know, you kind of get back on track.
02:32:02.92 --> 02:32:03.92 Yeah.
02:32:03.92 --> 02:32:04.92 And.
02:32:04.92 --> 02:32:06.92 Your teaching jiu jitsu, like you said.
02:32:06.92 --> 02:32:10.92 And there's a good quote here when you're teaching jitsu after you had the incident.
02:32:10.92 --> 02:32:18.92 Yeah, at Webster Hall and one of the parents said, you know, so here he comes back to start teaching the kids class again after he's been all over the front page of all the papers.
02:32:18.92 --> 02:32:24.92 Everybody's looking at me like, oh, I walked in the academy and like every half the people were like super happy to see me in there.
02:32:24.92 --> 02:32:29.92 They have looked at me like just like a gunslinger just walked it like I was like, you know,
02:32:29.92 --> 02:32:31.92 fucking wild west.
02:32:31.92 --> 02:32:39.92 One of the moms, one of the moms was quoted as saying, well, at least I know my kid isn't getting taught jiu jitsu by a pussy.
02:32:39.92 --> 02:32:40.92 Yeah.
02:32:40.92 --> 02:32:41.92 Yeah.
02:32:41.92 --> 02:32:45.92 And that was what that fucking baby has allowed.
02:32:45.92 --> 02:32:52.92 And yet, there's still, um, there's still hard times because at this point, you're losing custody your kids.
02:32:52.92 --> 02:32:53.92 Yeah.
02:32:53.92 --> 02:33:06.92 And that was, you know, that's, you know, I got to tell you, I mean, that that has been the biggest trial and tribulation I've dealt with.
02:33:06.92 --> 02:33:21.92 And obviously I've dealt with many, but, you know, especially someone who didn't really have responsible people like really raising me, you know,
02:33:21.92 --> 02:33:30.92 I, it really hurts to not be there for your kids every day, you know, because I really, I used to cherish those moments more than anything.
02:33:30.92 --> 02:33:35.92 I mean, just walking them to school in the morning and the little conversations we would have on the way to school.
02:33:35.92 --> 02:33:44.92 And, you know, taking them to jiu jitsu and, you know, I really was the, this is the main care taker.
02:33:44.92 --> 02:33:50.92 I was with them all day, you know, I did everything with them took them to the park, to museums, to this is a that's is.
02:33:50.92 --> 02:33:57.92 And, and then have that taken away.
02:33:57.92 --> 02:34:03.92 It's difficult to, again, to not start fucking up.
02:34:03.92 --> 02:34:13.92 You know, especially when you're dealing with depression and all that shit and again, you know, it's just like, like I said, you know,
02:34:13.92 --> 02:34:21.92 you know, have someone to love and to feel that that reciprocation and, you know,
02:34:21.92 --> 02:34:27.92 feel needed, it's hard to not feel needed, you know.
02:34:27.92 --> 02:34:39.92 But I, you know, I went through all the process of family courtness and then, you know, unfortunately they don't live with me full time, but I see them a lot.
02:34:39.92 --> 02:34:52.92 And, you know, everybody knows who's been through a divorce and as kids, or I fortunately, I was never married to their mother and we, but anybody who's been in that situation knows it's not easy and it comes with a lot of challenges.
02:34:52.92 --> 02:35:11.92 So now my challenges is to try to be involved with my kids' lives as much as I can and to try to give them some moral guidance and manhood guidance from a distance, you know.
02:35:11.92 --> 02:35:15.92 And sadly, they didn't see, you know, me and their mother act like complete and toll.
02:35:15.92 --> 02:35:21.92 So, averages towards the end of the relationship because people when they break up, they typically don't know how to act or behave.
02:35:21.92 --> 02:35:23.92 Even in front of their kids.
02:35:23.92 --> 02:35:37.92 So, but, you know, even all of this is made me a stronger and wiser person because I feel that it has again forced me to look at myself.
02:35:37.92 --> 02:35:47.92 And, you have choices in every situation, how you're going to react and how you're, you know, what you're going to do.
02:35:47.92 --> 02:35:52.92 And now I really think about the consequences of everything.
02:35:52.92 --> 02:36:05.92 I know I can't just react, explosively if somebody does or says something to me on the street because I know that that could cause me my freedom.
02:36:05.92 --> 02:36:11.92 It could cause that my kids, their father could cause my wife or husband.
02:36:11.92 --> 02:36:21.92 So, you know, even losing my kids has been a learning experience that I hope.
02:36:21.92 --> 02:36:33.92 God forbid they ever, you know, wind up with kids and separated in this and that, but hopefully even this bad stuff can help them become better men and smarter men,
02:36:33.92 --> 02:36:38.92 and hopefully better smarter than I was.
02:36:38.92 --> 02:36:51.92 You know, and I just try to believe really in the end-love wins, you know.
02:36:51.92 --> 02:37:02.92 Yeah, there's to one more thing that you had to overcome in the book.
02:37:02.92 --> 02:37:15.92 And, you know, sometimes, man, I just read a big chunk of the books that I'm reviewing because it's just a, the way it's written and the way it goes together and the story that it tells,
02:37:15.92 --> 02:37:20.92 I just don't really want to change and I just want to put it out there.
02:37:20.92 --> 02:37:26.92 So, I'm kind of going to do that right here.
02:37:26.92 --> 02:37:39.92 After all the madness in my life and the recent drama surrounding Webster Hall, my arrest losing my kids, starting a new relationship, getting my kids back in my life and dealing with all the drama of family court.
02:37:39.92 --> 02:37:43.92 My mom was stricken with terminal cancer.
02:37:43.92 --> 02:37:50.92 After a major operation in what seemed like a recovery, things took a turn for the worse.
02:37:50.92 --> 02:37:59.92 And through it all, she remained supportive in my battle for my kids, and I started spending a lot more time with her.
02:37:59.92 --> 02:38:03.92 It's fucked up when you know your mom or dad is dying.
02:38:03.92 --> 02:38:12.92 You go through your whole life with all the baggage and shit that they put on you and all the shit in the world and your friends put on you.
02:38:12.92 --> 02:38:22.92 And then there comes a time when you realize you have to put it all down and just let it all go.
02:38:22.92 --> 02:38:26.92 I was with her as much as possible during the last few months.
02:38:26.92 --> 02:38:29.92 We spent more time together than we had in years.
02:38:29.92 --> 02:38:36.92 We even left the city one day just a month before she died to spend some time at a horse stable.
02:38:36.92 --> 02:38:41.92 She loved horses and she hadn't been around them since she was a child.
02:38:41.92 --> 02:38:46.92 She said it was the most beautiful day in her entire life.
02:38:46.92 --> 02:38:52.92 And later she spent the night and then the next three nights in my apartment.
02:38:52.92 --> 02:38:58.92 We had such a good time that she completely forgot to take her pain medication.
02:38:58.92 --> 02:39:03.92 I hope I can face death with as much dignity.
02:39:03.92 --> 02:39:08.92 The way she has handled it, I've never seen a brave person in my life.
02:39:08.92 --> 02:39:12.92 She makes all the men I know look like cowards.
02:39:12.92 --> 02:39:17.92 Sadly, she only saw my kids twice during her last few months.
02:39:17.92 --> 02:39:23.92 But the time that they spent together was amazing and very meaningful and picked up her spirits.
02:39:23.92 --> 02:39:24.92 And I don't know.
02:39:24.92 --> 02:39:31.92 And I know that she took great comfort in the fact that I'm finally in a place in my life where things are coming together in a positive way.
02:39:31.92 --> 02:39:37.92 I just wish she could have been here with us longer.
02:39:37.92 --> 02:39:46.92 She died Monday, June 15, 2015.
02:39:46.92 --> 02:39:52.92 At the funeral, her ashes were carried out and placed on a table.
02:39:52.92 --> 02:39:55.92 They weren't a box not meant to be buried.
02:39:55.92 --> 02:40:00.92 A beautiful statue of a crying angel.
02:40:00.92 --> 02:40:04.92 We all took part in reading from Bible verses.
02:40:04.92 --> 02:40:08.92 I held onto my son Jonah and he cried quietly.
02:40:08.92 --> 02:40:17.92 My son Harley stood behind me with my girlfriend trying to keep his composure as tears rolled down as face.
02:40:17.92 --> 02:40:22.92 At the end of the service of slight drizzle of rain started again.
02:40:22.92 --> 02:40:27.92 Whenever everyone was done consoling each other and people started walking away,
02:40:27.92 --> 02:40:33.92 I looked at the box sitting on the table surrounded by flowers with the whole in the ground beside it.
02:40:33.92 --> 02:40:48.92 Two cemetery workers arrived with shovels and a rake and I walked back and asked if I could cover her with soil myself as I had done for my father 13 years earlier.
02:40:48.92 --> 02:40:55.92 I explained that I didn't feel right about someone who didn't know my mother covering her with dirt.
02:40:55.92 --> 02:40:58.92 They understood.
02:40:58.92 --> 02:41:01.92 I think them.
02:41:01.92 --> 02:41:05.92 I took the box with the angel off the table.
02:41:05.92 --> 02:41:09.92 I kissed it. My son's kissed it.
02:41:09.92 --> 02:41:14.92 And I got down on my knees and put it in the ground.
02:41:14.92 --> 02:41:20.92 One of the cemetery workers handed me a shovel and I started to fill the hole.
02:41:20.92 --> 02:41:24.92 My youngest son, who had been crying, came over next to me.
02:41:24.92 --> 02:41:27.92 God on his knees and started to help me fill the hole with his hands.
02:41:27.92 --> 02:41:32.92 Grabbing pieces of soil and putting them in, picking out rocks.
02:41:32.92 --> 02:41:36.92 So none would damage her box as we filled it.
02:41:36.92 --> 02:41:39.92 And his tears stopped.
02:41:39.92 --> 02:41:43.92 I put down the shovel and we both finished by hand.
02:41:43.92 --> 02:41:48.92 And then I raked the soil over and we padded down the earth with our hands.
02:41:48.92 --> 02:41:52.92 And it was done.
02:41:52.92 --> 02:41:59.92 They were so sad and so beautiful.
02:41:59.92 --> 02:42:04.92 The next day was father's day.
02:42:04.92 --> 02:42:08.92 When I started writing this book, I didn't know what the end was going to be.
02:42:08.92 --> 02:42:15.92 Or what I wanted to say besides telling the story of my life and setting the record straight.
02:42:15.92 --> 02:42:21.92 But now it's so obvious what is about.
02:42:21.92 --> 02:42:23.92 Closure.
02:42:40.92 --> 02:42:42.92 And that.
02:42:47.92 --> 02:42:49.92 That wraps up the book.
02:42:49.92 --> 02:42:53.92 And.
02:42:53.92 --> 02:42:57.92 And.
02:42:57.92 --> 02:43:04.92 Look, no one has lived a perfect life.
02:43:04.92 --> 02:43:06.92 We've all made mistakes.
02:43:06.92 --> 02:43:09.92 We've all done things that can't be undone.
02:43:09.92 --> 02:43:16.92 And we've gone places that we should not have gone.
02:43:16.92 --> 02:43:23.92 But we all have the opportunity to redeem ourselves.
02:43:23.92 --> 02:43:26.92 And it starts with confessing.
02:43:26.92 --> 02:43:28.92 What we've done, it starts with owning it.
02:43:28.92 --> 02:43:35.92 And then getting on the right path and staying on the right path.
02:43:35.92 --> 02:43:39.92 And staying on that path.
02:43:39.92 --> 02:43:41.92 The correct path.
02:43:41.92 --> 02:43:43.92 It takes discipline.
02:43:43.92 --> 02:43:46.92 And it takes humility. And it takes courage.
02:43:46.92 --> 02:43:51.92 And it's hard.
02:43:51.92 --> 02:43:54.92 But.
02:43:54.92 --> 02:44:00.92 What is the other choice?
02:44:00.92 --> 02:44:02.92 What else can we do?
02:44:02.92 --> 02:44:06.92 Let the darkness completely consume us.
02:44:06.92 --> 02:44:15.92 We've.
02:44:15.92 --> 02:44:18.92 For instant gratification wherever we can find it.
02:44:18.92 --> 02:44:21.92 Be overtaken.
02:44:21.92 --> 02:44:25.92 By temptation.
02:44:25.92 --> 02:44:29.92 And vice.
02:44:29.92 --> 02:44:34.92 No.
02:44:34.92 --> 02:44:37.92 That's struggle with all these things.
02:44:37.92 --> 02:44:38.92 They're caught.
02:44:38.92 --> 02:44:42.92 They're drowning.
02:44:42.92 --> 02:44:55.92 They're folding under the weight of pain and suffering and misery and addiction.
02:44:55.92 --> 02:45:02.92 And they ask me what I think.
02:45:02.92 --> 02:45:14.92 And what Harley proves is that you are better than that.
02:45:14.92 --> 02:45:15.92 You are better.
02:45:15.92 --> 02:45:19.92 And you can triumph over these dark forces.
02:45:19.92 --> 02:45:21.92 You can become better.
02:45:21.92 --> 02:45:24.92 You can be better.
02:45:24.92 --> 02:45:26.92 For yourself.
02:45:26.92 --> 02:45:30.92 And for the people around you.
02:45:30.92 --> 02:45:35.92 For all of us.
02:45:35.92 --> 02:45:40.92 Hold the line.
02:45:40.92 --> 02:45:46.92 Stay clean.
02:45:46.92 --> 02:45:55.92 And never surrender.
02:45:55.92 --> 02:46:09.92 You overcame a lot of stuff, man.
02:46:09.92 --> 02:46:11.92 I have.
02:46:11.92 --> 02:46:16.92 Still trying.
02:46:16.92 --> 02:46:21.92 Yeah.
02:46:21.92 --> 02:46:28.92 I guess everyone is.
02:46:28.92 --> 02:46:32.92 This is the time in the podcast.
02:46:32.92 --> 02:46:39.92 Why we have that go here.
02:46:39.92 --> 02:46:42.92 Because we got the chance to decompress a little bit.
02:46:42.92 --> 02:46:43.92 Yes.
02:46:43.92 --> 02:46:46.92 He gets to ask a couple questions.
02:46:46.92 --> 02:46:53.92 They're playing my little quick.
02:46:53.92 --> 02:46:56.92 Yeah.
02:46:56.92 --> 02:46:59.92 You can see when I walk.
02:46:59.92 --> 02:47:00.92 Yeah.
02:47:00.92 --> 02:47:03.92 You thought it was a compound fracture.
02:47:03.92 --> 02:47:05.92 Yeah.
02:47:05.92 --> 02:47:06.92 Yeah.
02:47:06.92 --> 02:47:08.92 I was wondering how it was bone.
02:47:08.92 --> 02:47:10.92 Makes sense.
02:47:10.92 --> 02:47:17.92 Yeah.
02:47:17.92 --> 02:47:23.92 You can get straight up stabbed.
02:47:23.92 --> 02:47:24.92 Yeah.
02:47:24.92 --> 02:47:27.92 Stuff hanging out.
02:47:27.92 --> 02:47:28.92 Yeah.
02:47:28.92 --> 02:47:29.92 What's next?
02:47:29.92 --> 02:47:32.92 Oh, my head is all for you.
02:47:32.92 --> 02:47:33.92 Okay.
02:47:33.92 --> 02:47:34.92 So clear.
02:47:34.92 --> 02:47:35.92 Here's your eyeball.
02:47:35.92 --> 02:47:38.92 Thanks.
02:47:38.92 --> 02:47:41.92 Yeah.
02:47:41.92 --> 02:47:47.92 That's why I'm so sketchy when it comes to, like as much as I, you know, I got admitted.
02:47:47.92 --> 02:47:49.92 That's it was fun.
02:47:49.92 --> 02:47:52.92 I like a good adrenaline.
02:47:52.92 --> 02:47:53.92 It's done.
02:47:53.92 --> 02:47:57.92 A good violent confrontation.
02:47:57.92 --> 02:47:58.92 A good fight.
02:47:58.92 --> 02:48:03.92 It is fun.
02:48:03.92 --> 02:48:07.92 It's like life and death.
02:48:07.92 --> 02:48:11.92 You know, so it's like, you know, like I said, you know, like I had that one fight and
02:48:11.92 --> 02:48:17.92 California where I'm running into a mob of all these dudes, like, you know, I was high off that shit for like a week.
02:48:17.92 --> 02:48:20.92 My adrenaline was like, I felt like I could fucking.
02:48:20.92 --> 02:48:22.92 Yeah.
02:48:22.92 --> 02:48:28.92 And then like a week later, I'm like, what the fuck was that shit?
02:48:28.92 --> 02:48:29.92 Yeah.
02:48:29.92 --> 02:48:34.92 As much as, you know, yeah, it was fun.
02:48:34.92 --> 02:48:38.92 How often do you get to have a street fight anymore, you know, shit, especially at my age?
02:48:38.92 --> 02:48:39.92 But three guys.
02:48:39.92 --> 02:48:40.92 Yeah.
02:48:40.92 --> 02:48:41.92 That's a nice full-time.
02:48:41.92 --> 02:48:43.92 But it was all the other shit, all the fucking ripple effects that came one way or like fuck.
02:48:43.92 --> 02:48:44.92 I mean, I see my kids.
02:48:44.92 --> 02:48:45.92 Fuck.
02:48:45.92 --> 02:48:50.92 I may be in jail, fuck, over the next three years, like fucking, you know, protecting my ass from bubbles over here.
02:48:50.92 --> 02:48:51.92 Yeah.
02:48:51.92 --> 02:48:54.92 You know, like fucking, you know, the whole shit was like, damn, man.
02:48:54.92 --> 02:48:56.92 Okay, we forget we just all get along.
02:48:56.92 --> 02:49:01.92 Okay, we all just have a street fight, you know, just like, can we all just have a street fight?
02:49:01.92 --> 02:49:04.92 Get on with our shit, you know.
02:49:04.92 --> 02:49:07.92 But, you know, shit happens.
02:49:07.92 --> 02:49:09.92 Yeah, we're gonna do, man.
02:49:09.92 --> 02:49:11.92 Yeah, we put everything into perspective.
02:49:11.92 --> 02:49:15.92 The whole getting into street fights doesn't seem quite as dope.
02:49:15.92 --> 02:49:16.92 Yeah.
02:49:16.92 --> 02:49:19.92 You know, it's, it changes when you got responsibility.
02:49:19.92 --> 02:49:21.92 Yeah, that's the thing.
02:49:21.92 --> 02:49:22.92 The responsibility.
02:49:22.92 --> 02:49:23.92 Yeah.
02:49:23.92 --> 02:49:26.92 And he's speaking or responsibility.
02:49:26.92 --> 02:49:27.92 He's speaking of responsibility.
02:49:27.92 --> 02:49:29.92 We're not getting any younger.
02:49:29.92 --> 02:49:32.92 So we'll talk about on it first, as always.
02:49:32.92 --> 02:49:37.92 So on it, supplements, you know, you know, but on it.
02:49:37.92 --> 02:49:38.92 No.
02:49:38.92 --> 02:49:39.92 Most people don't use to know about on it.
02:49:39.92 --> 02:49:40.92 Oh, and the West Coast, they do.
02:49:40.92 --> 02:49:43.92 I think that's how you motherfuckers are so big, because you're on it.
02:49:43.92 --> 02:49:45.92 Yeah, I need to get so much shit.
02:49:45.92 --> 02:49:46.92 I need to get out of my head.
02:49:46.92 --> 02:49:47.92 I need to get out of it.
02:49:47.92 --> 02:49:48.92 Yeah, I need to get out of it.
02:49:48.92 --> 02:49:49.92 Yeah, I love my head.
02:49:49.92 --> 02:49:50.92 Yeah, what the fuck is up with on it?
02:49:50.92 --> 02:49:53.92 Yeah, actually true, but here in India, and that's what I thought too,
02:49:53.92 --> 02:49:56.92 with supplements, where it's like, yeah, it takes up a month to get you big.
02:49:56.92 --> 02:49:58.92 I found that that's not necessarily the case.
02:49:58.92 --> 02:50:00.92 So the supplements that I take that we take.
02:50:00.92 --> 02:50:01.92 Mm-hmm.
02:50:01.92 --> 02:50:04.92 They're for like, you got a suitcase with some enemy.
02:50:04.92 --> 02:50:06.92 I'll get you out of it.
02:50:06.92 --> 02:50:07.92 I'll get you out of it.
02:50:07.92 --> 02:50:09.92 I'm getting on it, motherfucker.
02:50:09.92 --> 02:50:11.92 I've been on another shit.
02:50:11.92 --> 02:50:12.92 I'm gonna get on it.
02:50:12.92 --> 02:50:14.92 This is, this is stuff that's good.
02:50:14.92 --> 02:50:15.92 This is legal.
02:50:15.92 --> 02:50:18.92 I want, I want you to be on the right stuff,
02:50:18.92 --> 02:50:20.92 that's what you're talking about.
02:50:20.92 --> 02:50:21.92 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
02:50:21.92 --> 02:50:22.92 Move it towards the lights.
02:50:22.92 --> 02:50:24.92 Yeah, the light is on it.
02:50:24.92 --> 02:50:24.92 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
02:50:24.92 --> 02:50:26.92 This is the way for the darkness.
02:50:26.92 --> 02:50:27.92 Yes.
02:50:27.92 --> 02:50:29.92 But you can do Jinyan Hall like you get, for example,
02:50:29.92 --> 02:50:33.92 the ones that I take feet now,
02:50:33.92 --> 02:50:34.92 this krill oil.
02:50:34.92 --> 02:50:35.92 Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
02:50:35.92 --> 02:50:37.92 For inflammation and this is your life.
02:50:37.92 --> 02:50:38.92 Exactly, right?
02:50:38.92 --> 02:50:39.92 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
02:50:39.92 --> 02:50:40.92 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
02:50:40.92 --> 02:50:43.92 So the, so I know it is like a real reputable company that,
02:50:43.92 --> 02:50:45.92 like you know you're getting,
02:50:45.92 --> 02:50:47.92 because right, you can get supplements.
02:50:47.92 --> 02:50:50.92 Yeah, you get it like fiddle,
02:50:50.92 --> 02:50:52.92 they say crill and you're getting like fucking rot oil.
02:50:52.92 --> 02:50:53.92 Yeah, right?
02:50:53.92 --> 02:50:56.92 Yeah, this match point or oil, this is shit, you know?
02:50:56.92 --> 02:50:57.92 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
02:50:57.92 --> 02:50:59.92 And they're like, yeah, there's crill oil here.
02:50:59.92 --> 02:51:00.92 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
02:51:00.92 --> 02:51:02.92 But the rest of it's all vitamin E gel.
02:51:02.92 --> 02:51:03.92 Yes, exactly right.
02:51:03.92 --> 02:51:04.92 So this is on it.
02:51:04.92 --> 02:51:06.92 It's like known to be the best.
02:51:06.92 --> 02:51:09.92 I'm gonna have to get down, actually.
02:51:09.92 --> 02:51:11.92 I'll be the main guy.
02:51:11.92 --> 02:51:14.92 His, like he has extensive background and like,
02:51:14.92 --> 02:51:16.92 uptake, you know how like,
02:51:16.92 --> 02:51:21.92 You can get calcium supplement, but that supplement won't deliver the uptake so your body
02:51:21.92 --> 02:51:24.72 doesn't get even breaking it down or absorbing it.
02:51:24.72 --> 02:51:25.72 Yeah, it's exactly that.
02:51:25.72 --> 02:51:28.72 So there's only still a lot of different vitamins and all that shit.
02:51:28.72 --> 02:51:32.72 I try to get all my vitamins through food.
02:51:32.72 --> 02:51:33.72 Yes.
02:51:33.72 --> 02:51:35.72 If I can, you know, that's optimal.
02:51:35.72 --> 02:51:36.72 Yeah.
02:51:36.72 --> 02:51:41.52 So that's kind of the point where like, yeah, when you get it with food, you know that you're
02:51:41.52 --> 02:51:42.52 going to get the best uptake.
02:51:42.52 --> 02:51:46.52 But for the most part, you know, if you're getting your, you know, I don't know,
02:51:46.52 --> 02:51:51.40 protein from soybeans or something, you know, I don't get as much protein as you animals
02:51:51.40 --> 02:51:52.40 over here.
02:51:52.40 --> 02:51:53.40 I'm a vegetarian.
02:51:53.40 --> 02:51:57.24 I have been since like 82 or something like that.
02:51:57.24 --> 02:52:02.40 What I also think is one of the reasons why I managed to maintain a certain level
02:52:02.40 --> 02:52:04.68 of health and sanity.
02:52:04.68 --> 02:52:09.76 I think that that actually helped me the wheatgrass.
02:52:09.76 --> 02:52:12.76 Yeah, we're so weak.
02:52:12.76 --> 02:52:15.76 Hey, hey, everyone's wishing to podcast.
02:52:15.76 --> 02:52:18.88 You're shooting up heroin, make sure you're safe here, we're grass.
02:52:18.88 --> 02:52:21.16 And always wear a condom when you're shooting.
02:52:21.16 --> 02:52:22.16 Yeah.
02:52:22.16 --> 02:52:24.16 Yeah, good lord.
02:52:24.16 --> 02:52:27.64 But yeah, figure that's optimal from the food.
02:52:27.64 --> 02:52:33.64 But on it, like they do a good job in knowing like the optimum way to uptake the nutrients.
02:52:33.64 --> 02:52:34.64 Yeah, found that out.
02:52:34.64 --> 02:52:35.64 Nice.
02:52:35.64 --> 02:52:38.000 That's a, you know, that's a good one.
02:52:38.000 --> 02:52:39.28 You know, one of the reasons.
02:52:39.28 --> 02:52:43.68 So we do krill oil, strong bone new when I just started jockel always does it for your
02:52:43.68 --> 02:52:44.68 joints.
02:52:44.68 --> 02:52:47.44 Did you get to, you know, now I have some joint issues.
02:52:47.44 --> 02:52:48.44 Yeah, man.
02:52:48.44 --> 02:52:49.44 After a while, that's how.
02:52:49.44 --> 02:52:50.44 Yeah.
02:52:50.44 --> 02:52:52.24 Yeah, and the krill oil helps a lot.
02:52:52.24 --> 02:52:53.24 A lot, a lot.
02:52:53.24 --> 02:52:54.64 I'd say that's the number one.
02:52:54.64 --> 02:52:55.64 I think so.
02:52:55.64 --> 02:52:56.64 That I would recommend.
02:52:56.64 --> 02:53:01.000 I'd recommend a few more other things too, but just for different reasons.
02:53:01.000 --> 02:53:03.52 Like they have this one of warrior bars, buff well, you're vegetarian.
02:53:03.52 --> 02:53:04.52 So never mind a problem.
02:53:04.52 --> 02:53:05.52 It's buffalo meat.
02:53:05.52 --> 02:53:06.52 Buffalo meat.
02:53:06.52 --> 02:53:08.40 Made, you know, like they make not necessarily.
02:53:08.40 --> 02:53:10.000 Well, I know buffalo meat better for you.
02:53:10.000 --> 02:53:12.44 I mean, I know, you know, it doesn't have all the fucking hormones.
02:53:12.44 --> 02:53:16.44 I don't know if you could necessarily offer it to the gods, which god you're offering
02:53:16.44 --> 02:53:17.44 it to.
02:53:17.44 --> 02:53:19.44 I mean, I'm sure there's some Native American god you could offer.
02:53:19.44 --> 02:53:21.44 There's a lot of god there.
02:53:21.44 --> 02:53:23.44 I mean, the warrior bars, it's good.
02:53:23.44 --> 02:53:24.44 I know that much.
02:53:24.44 --> 02:53:25.44 Yeah.
02:53:25.44 --> 02:53:27.44 You know, I'm just going to feel him do.
02:53:27.44 --> 02:53:28.44 There's enough gods to pick from.
02:53:28.44 --> 02:53:29.44 Yeah, sure.
02:53:29.44 --> 02:53:31.44 I think I've got plenty of.
02:53:31.44 --> 02:53:32.44 Yeah.
02:53:32.44 --> 02:53:36.44 I think they'd be down for the shrimp tech as well, which is stuff.
02:53:36.44 --> 02:53:38.44 It's made from mushroom.
02:53:38.44 --> 02:53:39.44 Can you know the mushroom name?
02:53:39.44 --> 02:53:40.44 Different kind of mushroom.
02:53:40.44 --> 02:53:42.44 Yeah, you're a muster.
02:53:42.44 --> 02:53:43.44 Yeah.
02:53:43.44 --> 02:53:44.44 Yeah.
02:53:44.44 --> 02:53:45.44 Yeah.
02:53:45.44 --> 02:53:47.44 When he boards started this out, good.
02:53:47.44 --> 02:53:51.44 But it's just to help you uptake oxygen when you go athletic.
02:53:51.44 --> 02:53:52.44 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
02:53:52.44 --> 02:53:53.44 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
02:53:53.44 --> 02:53:58.44 You know, you need to, especially as you get older, your oxygen doesn't travel as well.
02:53:58.44 --> 02:53:59.44 Yeah.
02:53:59.44 --> 02:54:05.44 I just realize there's no greater joy for echo than when someone's on the podcast as a guest
02:54:05.44 --> 02:54:07.44 that wants to know about the stuff.
02:54:07.44 --> 02:54:08.44 He's Paul Blot.
02:54:08.44 --> 02:54:09.44 He's good.
02:54:09.44 --> 02:54:13.44 That'll ask me at, like, when I'm training or whatever they look at, what's the real oil?
02:54:13.44 --> 02:54:18.44 Is that like, you know, you're thinking, and then, bro, I'm like, doing a sales pitch to my food.
02:54:18.44 --> 02:54:19.44 It seems like it anyway.
02:54:19.44 --> 02:54:20.44 You get him a crills shirt.
02:54:20.44 --> 02:54:21.44 Yeah.
02:54:21.44 --> 02:54:22.44 You're a scum.
02:54:22.44 --> 02:54:23.44 I'm gonna hit.
02:54:23.44 --> 02:54:24.44 I asked me about the krill oil.
02:54:24.44 --> 02:54:25.44 No, don't.
02:54:25.44 --> 02:54:26.44 Don't.
02:54:26.44 --> 02:54:26.44 Don't.
02:54:26.44 --> 02:54:27.44 Don't.
02:54:27.44 --> 02:54:29.44 I'm telling you, in the mornings, I told this start before.
02:54:29.44 --> 02:54:30.44 Jocard, it plenty times.
02:54:30.44 --> 02:54:34.44 In the mornings, my daughter, she's, she's like, for now, but, you know, when she's like three,
02:54:34.44 --> 02:54:37.44 she'd come in, which is the only person in the world that hasn't heard the story.
02:54:37.44 --> 02:54:38.44 It's hardly fun.
02:54:38.44 --> 02:54:39.44 Yeah.
02:54:39.44 --> 02:54:40.44 But he's about to hear it.
02:54:40.44 --> 02:54:41.44 No one's gonna stop for now.
02:54:41.44 --> 02:54:42.44 He did it all.
02:54:42.44 --> 02:54:43.44 He did it all.
02:54:43.44 --> 02:54:45.44 You and me talk for three hours right there?
02:54:45.44 --> 02:54:48.44 Echo gets to talk for an hour now about three hours.
02:54:48.44 --> 02:54:49.44 Go.
02:54:49.44 --> 02:54:51.44 Yeah, you told me story, and that was a good answer.
02:54:51.44 --> 02:54:52.44 Go.
02:54:52.44 --> 02:54:53.44 Here we go.
02:54:53.44 --> 02:54:54.44 Anyway, she'd jump.
02:54:54.44 --> 02:54:56.44 She'd she'd wake me up, jump from my back.
02:54:56.44 --> 02:54:58.44 So, you know, now I gotta stand up.
02:54:58.44 --> 02:55:02.44 Out of bed, cold sore from whatever.
02:55:02.44 --> 02:55:03.44 With a three year old, I'm at back.
02:55:03.44 --> 02:55:06.44 And it's best if I gotta do the correct form to get up.
02:55:06.44 --> 02:55:09.44 Otherwise, you know, you turn your back, you knees all that stuff.
02:55:09.44 --> 02:55:13.44 After like, it was just under a weak, krill oil.
02:55:13.44 --> 02:55:14.44 No factor.
02:55:14.44 --> 02:55:15.44 It's like I was already warm.
02:55:15.44 --> 02:55:17.44 That's the feeling.
02:55:17.44 --> 02:55:19.44 You want some krill oil now?
02:55:19.44 --> 02:55:20.44 I was just gonna interject.
02:55:20.44 --> 02:55:24.44 I gotta give my father-in-law some props to me.
02:55:24.44 --> 02:55:25.44 He rest in peace.
02:55:25.44 --> 02:55:26.44 He turned me on to the krill.
02:55:26.44 --> 02:55:27.44 Oh, right.
02:55:27.44 --> 02:55:28.44 See, my father-in-law, right?
02:55:28.44 --> 02:55:30.44 I mean, so the father-in-law's got what's up.
02:55:30.44 --> 02:55:32.44 Father-in-law's, they've been around.
02:55:32.44 --> 02:55:34.44 Yeah, they've been around a little longer than us.
02:55:34.44 --> 02:55:35.44 Yeah, no, he turned me on.
02:55:35.44 --> 02:55:41.44 And even though I am a vegetarian, I do take the fish or the krill oil and whatnot.
02:55:41.44 --> 02:55:49.44 Because, you know what, I mean, look, I started off as a vegetarian for whatever spiritual
02:55:49.44 --> 02:55:52.44 revisions and whatever health reasons.
02:55:52.44 --> 02:55:59.44 Now, I believe it's best to have a mainly vegetarian diet.
02:55:59.44 --> 02:56:04.44 But if my body starts saying, mother fuck, you need some fish.
02:56:04.44 --> 02:56:08.44 Like, you are like about to drop dead if you don't get some serious proteins.
02:56:08.44 --> 02:56:12.44 It's like, I will do what my body tells me to do.
02:56:12.44 --> 02:56:17.44 I think humans are designed to be able to do vegetarian and meat.
02:56:17.44 --> 02:56:19.44 That's why we have two different kinds of teeth.
02:56:19.44 --> 02:56:25.44 You know, when we were hunter-gatherers, you know, you were gathering a lot more than you were hunting,
02:56:25.44 --> 02:56:26.44 realistically.
02:56:26.44 --> 02:56:28.44 Because hunting wasn't always easy.
02:56:28.44 --> 02:56:30.44 You would have fucking spear, you know.
02:56:30.44 --> 02:56:35.44 So, you know, I listen to my body a lot too and my body usually tells me to eat.
02:56:35.44 --> 02:56:36.44 Okay.
02:56:36.44 --> 02:56:39.44 You know, props.
02:56:39.44 --> 02:56:40.44 Yep, total props.
02:56:40.44 --> 02:56:45.44 Well, the good thing about the krill, whether this meat, however much this means.
02:56:45.44 --> 02:56:48.44 How they harvest the krill is also, yes.
02:56:48.44 --> 02:56:50.44 Yes, so how they do it, though, is good.
02:56:50.44 --> 02:56:53.44 They use like eco-friendly chips.
02:56:53.44 --> 02:56:55.44 You watch the video friendly shit.
02:56:55.44 --> 02:56:56.44 Yeah, it's the crazy, it's the whole thing.
02:56:56.44 --> 02:57:00.44 You can do it.
02:57:00.44 --> 02:57:01.44 I can do it.
02:57:01.44 --> 02:57:04.44 I can do it.
02:57:04.44 --> 02:57:06.44 Not the go-friendly shit.
02:57:06.44 --> 02:57:07.44 Fuck it.
02:57:07.44 --> 02:57:10.44 I watched the video.
02:57:10.44 --> 02:57:11.44 I watched the video.
02:57:11.44 --> 02:57:12.44 Who's good?
02:57:12.44 --> 02:57:12.44 Okay.
02:57:12.44 --> 02:57:15.44 You just need that in your own podcast called The Echo on it.
02:57:15.44 --> 02:57:16.44 I'm gonna.
02:57:16.44 --> 02:57:17.44 I'm gonna.
02:57:17.44 --> 02:57:20.44 People need to know, I think you got to fucking make your own line.
02:57:20.44 --> 02:57:21.44 Echo oil.
02:57:21.44 --> 02:57:22.44 Something.
02:57:22.44 --> 02:57:23.44 I don't know.
02:57:23.44 --> 02:57:24.44 I'm not.
02:57:24.44 --> 02:57:25.44 I think they have an nail in that.
02:57:25.44 --> 02:57:26.44 Sure.
02:57:26.44 --> 02:57:27.44 All right, on it.
02:57:27.44 --> 02:57:28.44 I'm gonna get on it.
02:57:28.44 --> 02:57:29.44 Interesting.
02:57:29.44 --> 02:57:30.44 Lee enough.
02:57:30.44 --> 02:57:31.44 How your father-in-law turned out?
02:57:31.44 --> 02:57:32.44 My father-in-law turned me on to it.
02:57:32.44 --> 02:57:33.44 I didn't listen to him, by the way.
02:57:33.44 --> 02:57:35.44 I only did it when Jockel was like, yeah, I take krill.
02:57:35.44 --> 02:57:37.44 So I was like, okay, I'm gonna take krill on my father-in-law.
02:57:37.44 --> 02:57:38.44 Yeah, shit.
02:57:38.44 --> 02:57:39.44 Whatever.
02:57:39.44 --> 02:57:40.44 Anyway.
02:57:40.44 --> 02:57:41.44 Anyway.
02:57:41.44 --> 02:57:42.44 On it.
02:57:42.44 --> 02:57:43.44 .com slash Jockel.
02:57:43.44 --> 02:57:46.44 That's how you can get 10% off of all your stuff, whatever you like.
02:57:46.44 --> 02:57:48.44 Well, I'm just gonna ask him directly.
02:57:48.44 --> 02:57:49.44 Get me the 10%.
02:57:49.44 --> 02:57:50.44 Oh, it's like, yeah.
02:57:50.44 --> 02:57:51.44 Yeah.
02:57:51.44 --> 02:57:53.44 That's what I did in the beginning too.
02:57:53.44 --> 02:57:54.44 Take krill oil.
02:57:54.44 --> 02:57:55.44 Yeah.
02:57:55.44 --> 02:57:58.44 Also, good way to support Amazon.
02:57:58.44 --> 02:57:59.44 Click through.
02:57:59.44 --> 02:58:01.44 So what all that is, you shop Amazon, right?
02:58:01.44 --> 02:58:03.44 I guess I have.
02:58:03.44 --> 02:58:04.44 Yeah.
02:58:04.44 --> 02:58:05.44 Okay.
02:58:05.44 --> 02:58:06.44 That's a, yeah.
02:58:06.44 --> 02:58:08.44 You're the only person that had heard like the krill oil store.
02:58:08.44 --> 02:58:11.000 Now you're the only person in the world that's not getting everything that
02:58:11.000 --> 02:58:12.44 buy off of Amazon.
02:58:12.44 --> 02:58:13.44 I live in the city.
02:58:13.44 --> 02:58:14.44 I go to the store.
02:58:14.44 --> 02:58:16.44 I guess it's different here.
02:58:16.44 --> 02:58:17.44 We want it.
02:58:17.44 --> 02:58:18.44 We go out.

02:58:32.44 --> 02:58:33.44 Yeah.
02:58:33.44 --> 02:58:35.44 It's as much as no.
02:58:35.44 --> 02:58:36.44 Nothing.
02:58:36.44 --> 02:58:37.44 You can study.
02:58:37.44 --> 02:58:38.44 We have a winter.

02:58:45.44 --> 02:58:46.44 He takes it from California.
02:58:46.44 --> 02:58:47.44 He goes one step further.
02:58:47.44 --> 02:58:48.44 Yeah.
02:58:48.44 --> 02:58:49.44 My mom says that, oh yeah.
02:58:49.44 --> 02:58:50.44 And the winter.
02:58:50.44 --> 02:58:51.44 It rains a lot.
02:58:51.44 --> 02:58:52.44 I don't even know.
02:58:52.44 --> 02:58:54.44 I mean, it feeds the plants.
02:58:54.44 --> 02:58:55.44 Yeah.
02:58:55.44 --> 02:58:56.44 What is that?
02:58:56.44 --> 02:58:57.44 You know?
02:58:57.44 --> 02:58:59.44 Lessons of fucking mind soon.
02:58:59.44 --> 02:59:00.44 I don't want to hear it.
02:59:00.44 --> 02:59:01.44 Yeah, man.
02:59:01.44 --> 02:59:02.44 I hear that.
02:59:02.44 --> 02:59:03.44 That things.
02:59:03.44 --> 02:59:04.44 But yeah.
02:59:04.44 --> 02:59:05.44 So Amazon.
02:59:05.44 --> 02:59:06.44 All right.
02:59:06.44 --> 02:59:07.44 That's where it is.
02:59:07.44 --> 02:59:09.44 All these things you're during the mehons.
02:59:09.44 --> 02:59:13.44 In the event of you shopping on Amazon and it's good for everyone.
02:59:13.44 --> 02:59:15.44 Before you go to Emily, you click through the website.
02:59:15.44 --> 02:59:16.44 Through all websites.
02:59:16.44 --> 02:59:17.44 Your website.
02:59:17.44 --> 02:59:18.44 Your website.
02:59:18.44 --> 02:59:19.44 Yeah.
02:59:19.44 --> 02:59:20.44 So it's like a little.
02:59:20.44 --> 02:59:21.44 Yes.
02:59:21.44 --> 02:59:23.44 I'm not saying, hey, thanks for referring.
02:59:23.44 --> 02:59:24.44 You know, it's pretty dope.
02:59:24.44 --> 02:59:25.44 That's pretty dope.
02:59:25.44 --> 02:59:27.44 They give us a little bit a little piece of that.
02:59:27.44 --> 02:59:28.44 Yeah.
02:59:28.44 --> 02:59:29.44 And you know what it caught.
02:59:29.44 --> 02:59:33.44 The cool thing is because you can set up things for, like, podcasts.
02:59:33.44 --> 02:59:35.44 That's basically give me money.
02:59:35.44 --> 02:59:36.44 Get, just give me money.
02:59:36.44 --> 02:59:37.44 But yeah.
02:59:37.44 --> 02:59:40.44 I don't really like asking people for money.
02:59:40.44 --> 02:59:41.44 Yeah.
02:59:41.44 --> 02:59:42.44 This is, you don't even.
02:59:42.44 --> 02:59:42.44 It doesn't.
02:59:42.44 --> 02:59:43.44 Your price doesn't go up.
02:59:43.44 --> 02:59:45.44 It's actually in my book.
02:59:45.44 --> 02:59:46.44 It's kind of a good way to stick it to the man.
02:59:46.44 --> 02:59:49.44 Because Amazon got a kick a little bit down to the podcast.
02:59:49.44 --> 02:59:50.44 Yeah.
02:59:50.44 --> 02:59:53.44 But it's kind of not because you stick it to the man too.
02:59:53.44 --> 02:59:54.44 Yeah.
02:59:54.44 --> 02:59:55.44 I thought you were a wealthy man.
02:59:55.44 --> 02:59:56.44 You know what I mean?
02:59:56.44 --> 02:59:57.44 This is the way.
02:59:57.44 --> 02:59:59.44 Kind of an ambiguous position.
02:59:59.44 --> 03:00:01.44 I guess I'm proud of you.
03:00:01.44 --> 03:00:02.44 So that's the root man.
03:00:02.44 --> 03:00:03.44 I'm a good keeper.
03:00:03.44 --> 03:00:04.44 It's a joke.
03:00:04.44 --> 03:00:05.44 You're a fucking man.
03:00:05.44 --> 03:00:06.44 Wait a minute.
03:00:06.44 --> 03:00:07.44 I am a man.
03:00:07.44 --> 03:00:07.44 Wait a minute.
03:00:07.44 --> 03:00:08.44 I am a man.
03:00:08.44 --> 03:00:08.44 I'm a man.
03:00:08.44 --> 03:00:08.44 I'm a man.
03:00:08.44 --> 03:00:09.44 I'm a man.
03:00:09.44 --> 03:00:10.44 I'm a man.
03:00:10.44 --> 03:00:11.44 I'm a man.
03:00:11.44 --> 03:00:12.44 I'm a man.
03:00:12.44 --> 03:00:13.44 I'm a man.
03:00:13.44 --> 03:00:14.44 I'm a man.
03:00:14.44 --> 03:00:15.44 I'm a man.
03:00:15.44 --> 03:00:16.44 I'm a man.
03:00:16.44 --> 03:00:17.44 I'm a man.
03:00:17.44 --> 03:00:18.44 I'm a man.
03:00:18.44 --> 03:00:20.44 But I mean either way, you know, when you do do do do do do do do do do do do.
03:00:20.44 --> 03:00:21.44 I think it does benefit.
03:00:21.44 --> 03:00:22.44 I'm a man.
03:00:22.44 --> 03:00:23.44 I'm a man.
03:00:23.44 --> 03:00:24.44 Because like a referral, you know.
03:00:24.44 --> 03:00:25.44 I mean okay.
03:00:25.44 --> 03:00:30.44 So you're saying that somebody might order something from another online retailer, but
03:00:30.44 --> 03:00:33.44 instead someone says I'm going to support the podcast.
03:00:33.44 --> 03:00:34.44 Yeah, fuck that support the podcast.
03:00:34.44 --> 03:00:35.44 Yeah, yeah.
03:00:35.44 --> 03:00:36.44 I like that.
03:00:36.44 --> 03:00:37.44 Don't be a bunch of bitches.
03:00:37.44 --> 03:00:39.44 You got to support the home team.
03:00:39.44 --> 03:00:40.44 I feel the same way.
03:00:40.44 --> 03:00:41.44 I feel the same way.
03:00:41.44 --> 03:00:42.44 It's a part of the idea.
03:00:42.44 --> 03:00:44.44 But I'm actually pretty cool.
03:00:44.44 --> 03:00:45.44 Like that.
03:00:45.44 --> 03:00:47.44 They'll offer everyone to want like little things.
03:00:47.44 --> 03:00:51.44 I want to donate like you round up like let's say your thing costed like eight,
03:00:51.44 --> 03:00:52.44 eighty nine.
03:00:52.44 --> 03:00:55.44 You a year ago 11 cents to the next doll.
03:00:55.44 --> 03:00:57.44 You don't donate that 11 cents to like something.
03:00:57.44 --> 03:00:58.44 It's like chair anyway.
03:00:58.44 --> 03:00:59.44 I'm not so good like that.
03:00:59.44 --> 03:01:03.44 Anyway, you know, so put the podcast through the Amazon click through go to the
03:01:03.44 --> 03:01:08.44 jocopotcast website, which is jocopotcast.com and click on the support or the Amazon
03:01:08.44 --> 03:01:09.44 banner then do your shopping.
03:01:09.44 --> 03:01:10.44 That's a good way.
03:01:10.44 --> 03:01:12.44 Some people.
03:01:12.44 --> 03:01:14.44 They'll do it and then like the little.
03:01:14.44 --> 03:01:16.44 They'll get a screenshot of it and they'll sell it.
03:01:16.44 --> 03:01:18.44 And they'll send it to me on Twitter.
03:01:18.44 --> 03:01:20.44 Yeah, that's cool.
03:01:20.44 --> 03:01:21.44 That is dope.
03:01:21.44 --> 03:01:22.44 It's like confirmation.
03:01:22.44 --> 03:01:23.44 Yeah.
03:01:23.44 --> 03:01:25.44 And it's kind of like like they're saying hey, I'm supporting them.
03:01:25.44 --> 03:01:29.44 But and I feel that like the literal direct support from them.
03:01:29.44 --> 03:01:32.44 If you want to give that go Charles a good day as your support podcast.
03:01:32.44 --> 03:01:34.44 So hit him with a little social media.
03:01:34.44 --> 03:01:35.44 It's a little bit.
03:01:35.44 --> 03:01:39.44 A lot of times they don't see like the price and I think they'll they'll just say,
03:01:39.44 --> 03:01:41.44 Oh, it'll be a screenshot pretty ambiguous.
03:01:41.44 --> 03:01:44.44 It could very well not even be them supporting the podcast necessarily.
03:01:44.44 --> 03:01:47.44 Just I just feel like call. Yeah, just trying to tell you.
03:01:47.44 --> 03:01:48.44 It works.

03:01:49.44 --> 03:01:50.44 I like when they do that.
03:01:50.44 --> 03:01:51.44 It makes me feel good.
03:01:51.44 --> 03:01:52.44 I feel like they care.

03:02:22.44 --> 03:02:25.44 people been kind of giving me crap about saying excerpts a lot.

03:02:27.44 --> 03:02:30.44 Do you say it a lot and you put your tone on it?
03:02:30.44 --> 03:02:31.44 For real?
03:02:31.44 --> 03:02:32.44 Yeah.
03:02:32.44 --> 03:02:33.44 You don't you say.
03:02:33.44 --> 03:02:34.44 I don't think you said it a lot.
03:02:34.44 --> 03:02:36.44 No, you don't say, hey, you know, we've got some excerpts that we put on the,
03:02:36.44 --> 03:02:39.44 You go, I made a couple excerpts.
03:02:39.44 --> 03:02:43.44 Yeah, you go, you go escalation voice level 12.
03:02:43.44 --> 03:02:45.44 Yeah, I guess.
03:02:45.44 --> 03:02:47.44 Well, I think those, you're right.
03:02:47.44 --> 03:02:48.44 Was that your idea?
03:02:48.44 --> 03:02:49.44 excerpts?
03:02:49.44 --> 03:02:49.44 Yeah.
03:02:49.44 --> 03:02:50.44 There you go.
03:02:50.44 --> 03:02:52.44 Yeah, because people don't want to watch.
03:02:52.44 --> 03:02:54.44 Yeah, they're not going to watch three hours.
03:02:54.44 --> 03:02:56.44 Yeah, three hour podcast.
03:02:56.44 --> 03:02:59.44 If there's some point, oh, hey, Jocco, you cool thing with Harley Flanagan.
03:02:59.44 --> 03:03:00.44 He was talking about this.
03:03:00.44 --> 03:03:01.44 Yeah.
03:03:01.44 --> 03:03:02.44 They want to see Harley for three minutes.
03:03:02.44 --> 03:03:05.44 I want to send it to their buddy that they listen to Hardcore with.
03:03:05.44 --> 03:03:06.44 Yeah.
03:03:06.44 --> 03:03:11.44 They can't send them, hey, watch this three and a half hour podcast in the next during your lunch break.
03:03:11.44 --> 03:03:12.44 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
03:03:12.44 --> 03:03:13.44 You can't do it.
03:03:13.44 --> 03:03:14.44 You've got to send them a little clip.
03:03:14.44 --> 03:03:16.44 Listen, Harley Flanagan talk about a street fight.
03:03:16.44 --> 03:03:19.44 No, yeah, exactly right.
03:03:19.44 --> 03:03:22.44 Maybe you should do a bunch of excerpts of yourself talking about on it.
03:03:22.44 --> 03:03:23.44 An excerpt.
03:03:23.44 --> 03:03:24.44 Let me say an excerpts.
03:03:24.44 --> 03:03:27.44 Yeah, no, that's not very shareable.
03:03:27.44 --> 03:03:28.44 But that was a good idea.
03:03:28.44 --> 03:03:29.44 Thank you, Jocco, for that.
03:03:29.44 --> 03:03:33.44 So if you want to see excerpts of random lessons, not random, they're not random.
03:03:33.44 --> 03:03:34.44 Sorry, any mean random.
03:03:34.44 --> 03:03:39.44 Exerpts of lessons, individual lessons selected selected from the podcast.
03:03:39.44 --> 03:03:40.44 Boom, that's on YouTube.
03:03:40.44 --> 03:03:51.44 And also, if you want one, tell Echo on social media, hey, make this time period on this podcast into an excerpt and put me on their two because that way I can harass him.
03:03:51.44 --> 03:03:53.44 Now we can't do everything.
03:03:53.44 --> 03:03:54.44 Everything go on.

03:04:11.44 --> 03:04:14.44 But you're not going to do that one.
03:04:14.44 --> 03:04:15.44 You're going to do that one.
03:04:15.44 --> 03:04:18.44 That's the good.
03:04:18.44 --> 03:04:19.44 We'll have T-shirts.
03:04:19.44 --> 03:04:23.44 Because everybody, that's the good thing.
03:04:23.44 --> 03:04:27.44 They want excerpts, but people also want half T-shirts for everything.
03:04:27.44 --> 03:04:30.44 You know, like anything that some person share somewhere.

03:04:36.44 --> 03:04:40.44 And then it gets escalated to a certain point where enough people ask for it.
03:04:40.44 --> 03:04:42.44 And then we break down echo breaks down.
03:04:42.44 --> 03:04:43.44 Yeah.

03:05:19.44 --> 03:05:20.44 And then send it back to him and say,
03:05:20.44 --> 03:05:21.44 Hey, man, I already did it on this one.
03:05:21.44 --> 03:05:22.44 Yeah.
03:05:22.44 --> 03:05:24.44 Actually, that's a good, like how we're going over today.
03:05:24.44 --> 03:05:26.44 That's a good thing about how we put the,
03:05:26.44 --> 03:05:28.44 the timestamps on all the subjects.
03:05:28.44 --> 03:05:30.44 So, and that feeds into the search term.
03:05:30.44 --> 03:05:32.44 So if you, you're like, hey, soon, so,
03:05:32.44 --> 03:05:35.44 Jock podcast, art of war, it'll go.
03:05:35.44 --> 03:05:36.44 Boom.
03:05:36.44 --> 03:05:37.44 To that episode.
03:05:37.44 --> 03:05:38.44 Yeah.
03:05:38.44 --> 03:05:40.44 Twenty, twenty, three, you know, actually coming on top of this book.
03:05:40.44 --> 03:05:42.44 There's a book out about HR right now for the bad brands.
03:05:42.44 --> 03:05:43.44 Yeah.
03:05:43.44 --> 03:05:46.44 And the reason I'm thinking of this is because one of my buddies,
03:05:46.44 --> 03:05:51.44 who's into the podcast, who was a hardcore kid growing up.
03:05:51.44 --> 03:05:55.44 And his name's not go, but he's a, he's a cop in LA.
03:05:55.44 --> 03:05:57.44 And he was a cop in New York.
03:05:57.44 --> 03:06:00.44 And so, I'm just thinking about that.
03:06:00.44 --> 03:06:02.44 Like, here's a kid that grew up listening to the crowmags.
03:06:02.44 --> 03:06:04.44 Who's been like, saying, get hardly art.
03:06:04.44 --> 03:06:05.44 You got to get art.
03:06:05.44 --> 03:06:06.44 He's a cop.
03:06:06.44 --> 03:06:07.44 He's a bad ass cop.
03:06:07.44 --> 03:06:09.44 And his, and his girls a cop too.
03:06:09.44 --> 03:06:10.44 They're, they're getting that right.
03:06:10.44 --> 03:06:12.44 I got a phrase that a cop's man.
03:06:12.44 --> 03:06:12.44 Yeah.
03:06:12.44 --> 03:06:13.44 I don't hate them all.
03:06:13.44 --> 03:06:16.44 You know, you know, you know,
03:06:16.44 --> 03:06:18.44 people they'll be like, hey, no, I don't eat cops.
03:06:18.44 --> 03:06:19.44 I got friends that are cops.
03:06:19.44 --> 03:06:20.44 Yeah.
03:06:20.44 --> 03:06:24.44 Some of my best friends are blind.
03:06:24.44 --> 03:06:25.44 Yeah.
03:06:25.44 --> 03:06:28.44 Look, I got to picture me and a cop on my phone.
03:06:28.44 --> 03:06:30.44 Oh, that's what I'm thinking.
03:06:30.44 --> 03:06:31.44 Now I'm that bastard.
03:06:31.44 --> 03:06:32.44 Bastard.
03:06:32.44 --> 03:06:33.44 Bastard.
03:06:33.44 --> 03:06:37.44 Yeah, but I'm literally not to be trusted.
03:06:37.44 --> 03:06:38.44 Fuck.
03:06:38.44 --> 03:06:39.44 No.
03:06:39.44 --> 03:06:40.44 Okay.
03:06:40.44 --> 03:06:42.44 Also, hey, Jack was a story.
03:06:42.44 --> 03:06:43.44 It's called Jackal Store.
03:06:43.44 --> 03:06:44.44 He's shirt, Jackal and weird.
03:06:44.44 --> 03:06:45.44 Yeah, man.
03:06:45.44 --> 03:06:46.44 I think I need to get one of these.
03:06:46.44 --> 03:06:47.44 This clinic was freedom.
03:06:47.44 --> 03:06:48.44 My fucking shirt.
03:06:48.44 --> 03:06:52.44 You know, I wrote a song recently that I named discipline equals freedom.
03:06:52.44 --> 03:06:53.44 Oh, okay.
03:06:53.44 --> 03:06:54.44 Yeah.
03:06:54.44 --> 03:06:55.44 Yeah.
03:06:55.44 --> 03:06:58.44 And just I got a fucking say because, you know, I don't give a fuck.
03:06:58.44 --> 03:07:00.44 I'm going to say it.
03:07:00.44 --> 03:07:05.44 And that's that, you know, when I found out that Jackal was in the hardcore.
03:07:05.44 --> 03:07:12.44 And when I found out that he was into my band, the chrome axe, I was very proud
03:07:12.44 --> 03:07:15.44 and all.
03:07:15.44 --> 03:07:19.44 And I asked this mother, fuck, you have thought about singing in the hardcore.
03:07:19.44 --> 03:07:23.44 And the fucking reaction I got out of this mother fucker.
03:07:23.44 --> 03:07:29.18 If my computer screen could just turn into like a fucking screaming like, ah, the mother
03:07:29.18 --> 03:07:32.44 fucking, the response.
03:07:32.44 --> 03:07:38.44 Anyway, I'm very proud to say that what we're going to be playing besides doing this
03:07:38.44 --> 03:07:43.44 European tour, I'm going away in week playing all with place.
03:07:43.44 --> 03:07:46.44 And we're coming back and in June, I'm going to be playing in LA.
03:07:46.44 --> 03:07:52.44 And we have invited Jacko to come and make a special guest appearance when we play at the
03:07:52.44 --> 03:07:54.44 Fury Fest in LA.
03:07:54.44 --> 03:08:00.72 So for all you mother fuckers out there who want to see me playing with one of the baddest
03:08:00.72 --> 03:08:06.44 mother fuckers walking this fucking earth certified by the US fucking government.
03:08:06.44 --> 03:08:11.44 Then you, you, you, you were going to see some fucking badass shit because I'll tell you,
03:08:11.44 --> 03:08:17.44 I have not gotten, I haven't been able to just play the bass and not be like chained to the microphone
03:08:17.44 --> 03:08:18.44 in a really long time.
03:08:18.44 --> 03:08:23.44 And that was one of the things that was intense about the chromaics back in the old days was that me and the singer both used to go
03:08:23.44 --> 03:08:26.44 fucking, ape shit when we played.
03:08:26.44 --> 03:08:29.44 And it's funny because you know, I was, I've been thinking for the longest time.
03:08:29.44 --> 03:08:33.44 And if I could get a singer, what I get, and I'm like, you know, shit.
03:08:33.44 --> 03:08:37.44 I'm like, you know, Henry Rons and his prime was fucking badass, you know,
03:08:37.44 --> 03:08:41.44 Philon Selma when his prime was a fucking badass.
03:08:41.44 --> 03:08:44.44 I wanted to have a joke with you.
03:08:44.44 --> 03:08:47.44 So, what's he, what happens if my kids up in my hands?
03:08:47.44 --> 03:08:51.44 You would have to watch all you motherfuckers and what is he some shit?
03:08:51.44 --> 03:08:54.44 You know, I used to have a fake seals singing in my band.
03:08:54.44 --> 03:08:56.44 I didn't get a real one.
03:08:56.44 --> 03:08:59.44 What's he, what happens if my, if a mic ends up in my hands?
03:08:59.44 --> 03:09:01.44 Well, I may have to slap with him.
03:09:01.44 --> 03:09:03.44 I can see what happens.
03:09:03.44 --> 03:09:07.44 Oh, boom. Yeah, you can sing the, or with those shirts on.
03:09:07.44 --> 03:09:08.44 Yeah, that's a little bit.
03:09:08.44 --> 03:09:09.44 That's fucking right.
03:09:09.44 --> 03:09:12.44 Well, yeah, man, jockel story, that's where you get him.
03:09:12.44 --> 03:09:14.44 I got you. Whatever shirt you need.
03:09:14.44 --> 03:09:15.44 Oh yeah, for sure.
03:09:15.44 --> 03:09:19.44 But if you're in the mood to support the podcast purchase a shirt or whatever,
03:09:19.44 --> 03:09:21.44 we have other stuff on there.
03:09:21.44 --> 03:09:22.44 Jockel story, calm.
03:09:22.44 --> 03:09:24.44 What about those mugs you made?
03:09:24.44 --> 03:09:25.44 Yeah, those are some good mugs.
03:09:25.44 --> 03:09:27.44 So I shouldn't have even said this.
03:09:27.44 --> 03:09:30.44 He's been amped about these brawffy mugs we got.
03:09:30.44 --> 03:09:33.44 Or what do you call travel mugs? Travel mugs, tumblers.
03:09:33.44 --> 03:09:34.44 I've heard, yeah, I've heard.
03:09:34.44 --> 03:09:35.44 Here we go.
03:09:35.44 --> 03:09:37.44 All right, look, I won't go that deep into it this time.
03:09:37.44 --> 03:09:39.44 Next time I'm going deep.
03:09:39.44 --> 03:09:41.44 Extra deep. This time I'll go just kind of deep.
03:09:41.44 --> 03:09:44.44 This is straight up the best cup of everything.
03:09:44.44 --> 03:09:45.44 It's a look and look like his head.
03:09:45.44 --> 03:09:46.44 It's like a hands-line.
03:09:46.44 --> 03:09:47.44 Yeah, look, look, look, look.
03:09:47.44 --> 03:09:48.44 Drop better.
03:09:48.44 --> 03:09:48.44 Drop better.
03:09:48.44 --> 03:09:51.44 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
03:09:51.44 --> 03:09:53.44 Actually, we kept it a little bit.
03:09:53.44 --> 03:09:55.44 You know, it's just black on black.
03:09:55.44 --> 03:09:57.44 It's like black matte and then the design.
03:09:57.44 --> 03:09:59.44 You know, it looks like this on one side.
03:09:59.44 --> 03:10:01.44 And then it's shiny black.
03:10:01.44 --> 03:10:03.44 Anyway, it looks super dope.
03:10:03.44 --> 03:10:04.44 But 30 ounces.
03:10:04.44 --> 03:10:05.44 So big enough.
03:10:05.44 --> 03:10:08.44 But small enough, just fitting your cup holder.
03:10:08.44 --> 03:10:09.44 Boom.
03:10:09.44 --> 03:10:11.44 I'd be drinking some motherfuck coffee.
03:10:11.44 --> 03:10:13.44 So, so here's the thing.
03:10:13.44 --> 03:10:14.44 But the coffee.
03:10:14.44 --> 03:10:17.44 It's those ones that are like,
03:10:17.44 --> 03:10:20.44 I don't know how they make them, you know, the inside and the, I don't know.
03:10:20.44 --> 03:10:24.44 They're stainless steel, BPA-free, all this, you know, good stuff.
03:10:24.44 --> 03:10:27.44 I don't know what all of that means, but it's, I know it's dope.
03:10:27.44 --> 03:10:28.44 It's krill involved.
03:10:28.44 --> 03:10:30.44 Yeah, it's somewhere, you know, down the line.
03:10:30.44 --> 03:10:32.44 It's, uh, krill is involved.
03:10:32.44 --> 03:10:36.44 But it keeps it like your, if you like your coffee hot,
03:10:36.44 --> 03:10:39.44 it'll keep it hot for like eight hours or something like that.
03:10:39.44 --> 03:10:42.44 I don't know if it keeps it the same temperature for eight hours.
03:10:42.44 --> 03:10:43.44 It might, I don't know.
03:10:43.44 --> 03:10:44.44 I've never had hot summer.
03:10:44.44 --> 03:10:46.44 I'm a cold coffee guy.
03:10:46.44 --> 03:10:48.44 All right. Well, here's a good news about that, bro.
03:10:48.44 --> 03:10:49.44 I'm sure.
03:10:49.44 --> 03:10:50.44 But you put, put, put, how's this?
03:10:50.44 --> 03:10:53.44 I put ice water in it and I was drinking it.
03:10:53.44 --> 03:10:56.44 I drank, like almost all of it.
03:10:56.44 --> 03:10:59.44 There was still a little bit in the bottom and I forgot about it.
03:10:59.44 --> 03:11:00.44 Went to sleep.
03:11:00.44 --> 03:11:01.44 The next day I was cleaning up.
03:11:01.44 --> 03:11:03.44 I was like, oh, my cup from last night.
03:11:03.44 --> 03:11:05.44 Boom, ice, still in there.
03:11:05.44 --> 03:11:07.44 You know how usually in a regular cup, it's like water.
03:11:07.44 --> 03:11:09.44 It'll keep it cold for 24 hours.
03:11:09.44 --> 03:11:12.44 Boom, not losing any coldness.
03:11:12.44 --> 03:11:15.44 Anyway, I want to go way deeper next time.
03:11:15.44 --> 03:11:16.44 But this is straight.
03:11:16.44 --> 03:11:19.44 You have a special podcast for you to talk about that, that cup.
03:11:19.44 --> 03:11:20.44 A very good cup.
03:11:20.44 --> 03:11:22.44 Yeah, one episode will be the cup.

03:11:24.44 --> 03:11:25.44 Yeah. Oh, no, oil.
03:11:25.44 --> 03:11:26.44 That's it.
03:11:26.44 --> 03:11:27.44 That's everything.
03:11:27.44 --> 03:11:28.44 I'll go deep.
03:11:28.44 --> 03:11:29.44 I'll go deep with the oil.
03:11:29.44 --> 03:11:32.44 Bro, I'll go deep with the grill oil right now if we have to.
03:11:32.44 --> 03:11:33.44 I know what.
03:11:33.44 --> 03:11:34.44 Anyway, I'll go to the oil.

03:11:35.44 --> 03:11:36.44 Yeah.
03:11:36.44 --> 03:11:38.44 It's essentially what it is anyway.

03:11:51.44 --> 03:11:53.44 But nonetheless, I'm not going to promise anything quite yet.
03:11:53.44 --> 03:11:55.44 But new rash guards can be out.
03:11:55.44 --> 03:11:56.44 Hoodies are out there.

03:12:08.44 --> 03:12:09.44 So I'm going to explain it.
03:12:09.44 --> 03:12:10.44 Good deed.

03:12:51.44 --> 03:12:52.44 Yeah.
03:12:52.44 --> 03:12:54.44 Just a boy and we all did.
03:12:54.44 --> 03:12:55.44 When you skip your week grass.
03:12:55.44 --> 03:12:59.44 Exactly right.
03:12:59.44 --> 03:13:00.44 So bam, you get this.
03:13:00.44 --> 03:13:01.44 It's okay.
03:13:01.44 --> 03:13:03.44 It's an album called Psychological References.
03:13:03.44 --> 03:13:04.44 It's not music.
03:13:04.44 --> 03:13:10.44 It's just tracks with Jocco telling you how to overcome those week moments in your program.
03:13:10.44 --> 03:13:11.44 Oh boy.
03:13:11.44 --> 03:13:14.44 But it's him telling when I, when I, when I, I'm having a week moment,
03:13:14.44 --> 03:13:16.44 the last thing I want to fucking hear is,
03:13:16.44 --> 03:13:21.44 Choco fucking telling me to get after it.
03:13:21.44 --> 03:13:23.44 Oh fuck, really, right now.
03:13:23.44 --> 03:13:24.44 I gotta do that.
03:13:24.44 --> 03:13:25.44 Really, fuck.
03:13:25.44 --> 03:13:26.44 It's 4 o'clock.
03:13:26.44 --> 03:13:27.44 I don't really have it.
03:13:27.44 --> 03:13:30.44 Give me a fucking other four hours.
03:13:30.44 --> 03:13:32.44 Fuck me.
03:13:32.44 --> 03:13:33.44 You know, I like sleep.
03:13:33.44 --> 03:13:35.44 I don't know what the fuck is wrong with you guys, but whatever.
03:13:35.44 --> 03:13:36.44 That's all good.
03:13:36.44 --> 03:13:37.44 Yeah, heck.
03:13:37.44 --> 03:13:38.44 You know, echo like sleep too.
03:13:38.44 --> 03:13:39.44 I like sleep a lot.
03:13:39.44 --> 03:13:40.44 I'm having a lot of sleep.
03:13:40.44 --> 03:13:41.44 I like dreams.
03:13:41.44 --> 03:13:42.44 No, I like sleep too.
03:13:42.44 --> 03:13:44.44 No, actually I don't sleep as the enemy.
03:13:44.44 --> 03:13:49.44 I mean, I like the way it's like it's like the last hallucinogenic I can take.
03:13:49.44 --> 03:13:50.44 Yeah.
03:13:50.44 --> 03:13:51.44 Yeah.
03:13:51.44 --> 03:13:53.44 It's about sleep.
03:13:53.44 --> 03:13:54.44 It's just a sleep.
03:13:54.44 --> 03:13:55.44 I dream.
03:13:55.44 --> 03:13:56.44 My brain goes bananas.
03:13:56.44 --> 03:13:57.44 Love it.
03:13:57.44 --> 03:13:58.44 Yeah.
03:13:58.44 --> 03:14:00.44 If you have my dreams, you don't want to sleep.
03:14:00.44 --> 03:14:02.44 I love prefer to be awake.
03:14:02.44 --> 03:14:02.44 Yeah.
03:14:02.44 --> 03:14:03.44 I hear your sense.
03:14:03.44 --> 03:14:04.44 Yeah.
03:14:04.44 --> 03:14:04.44 Yeah.
03:14:04.44 --> 03:14:05.44 Okay.
03:14:05.44 --> 03:14:06.44 I get it.
03:14:06.44 --> 03:14:09.44 But it goes for the workout from 2 to not just a sleep.
03:14:09.44 --> 03:14:11.44 So you can skip the sleep ones.
03:14:11.44 --> 03:14:13.44 So you go, like, they, they work out when it's heavy.
03:14:13.44 --> 03:14:14.44 You don't skip the workout.
03:14:14.44 --> 03:14:15.44 Anyway, it's good.
03:14:15.44 --> 03:14:16.44 Very helpful.
03:14:16.44 --> 03:14:19.44 100% chance of success with talent.
03:14:19.44 --> 03:14:20.44 That's a good one.
03:14:20.44 --> 03:14:22.44 Psychological warfare.
03:14:22.44 --> 03:14:29.44 And also, by the way, when you click through Amazon, you can click through and you can buy this book right here.
03:14:29.44 --> 03:14:32.44 The book is called Hardcore Life of My Own.
03:14:32.44 --> 03:14:35.44 It is written by Harley Flanagan.
03:14:35.44 --> 03:14:37.44 And we'll have it up on the website.
03:14:37.44 --> 03:14:39.44 But let me refer to that.
03:14:39.44 --> 03:14:40.44 It's on the website.
03:14:40.44 --> 03:14:43.44 So we're waiting to be purchased.
03:14:43.44 --> 03:14:45.44 And there you go.

03:14:46.44 --> 03:14:50.44 On Amazon, you can also get some jok a white tea.
03:14:50.44 --> 03:14:56.44 I hear now there's some things in the book that Harley does not recommend.
03:14:56.44 --> 03:14:59.44 He, he's tried them, but he does not recommend.
03:14:59.44 --> 03:15:01.44 Some of those things that he clearly states in the book.
03:15:01.44 --> 03:15:03.44 He literally says, I do not recommend.
03:15:03.44 --> 03:15:07.44 For instance, I do not recommend angel bust.
03:15:07.44 --> 03:15:09.44 I do not recommend heroin.
03:15:09.44 --> 03:15:10.44 I do not.
03:15:10.44 --> 03:15:11.44 So there's a lot of things he doesn't recommend.
03:15:11.44 --> 03:15:14.44 Now, here's something that I will strongly recommend.
03:15:14.44 --> 03:15:16.44 And that's Jokal White Tea.
03:15:16.44 --> 03:15:21.44 It's going to get you a lot better results than anything.
03:15:21.44 --> 03:15:25.44 Any of the supplements that Harley's taking in this book.
03:15:25.44 --> 03:15:27.44 You go with Jokal White Tea instead.
03:15:27.44 --> 03:15:29.44 You're going to have a much better trip.
03:15:29.44 --> 03:15:32.44 I'm going to tell you that right now.
03:15:32.44 --> 03:15:35.44 Also, we talked a lot about jjitsu today.
03:15:35.44 --> 03:15:37.44 And we talked about jjitsu a lot.
03:15:37.44 --> 03:15:41.44 You know, jjitsu is a powerful thing.
03:15:41.44 --> 03:15:44.44 And there's a book that's out right now.
03:15:44.44 --> 03:15:45.44 And it's geared.
03:15:45.44 --> 03:15:47.44 It's written kind of written for kids.
03:15:47.44 --> 03:15:49.44 It's called Way of the War Your Kid.
03:15:49.44 --> 03:15:50.44 It's available.
03:15:50.44 --> 03:15:51.44 Everyone that's bought it already.
03:15:51.44 --> 03:15:52.44 Thank you.
03:15:52.44 --> 03:15:54.44 I appreciate the support.
03:15:54.44 --> 03:15:56.44 Thanks for spreading the word.
03:15:56.44 --> 03:15:59.44 Thanks for letting kids get a little insight into life.
03:15:59.44 --> 03:16:05.44 And I'll tell you there's something about this book that is,
03:16:05.44 --> 03:16:09.44 that I wrote it.
03:16:09.44 --> 03:16:11.44 The, the, the father.
03:16:11.44 --> 03:16:13.44 The book is about a kid who's, you know,
03:16:13.44 --> 03:16:15.44 fifth grade going through life.
03:16:15.44 --> 03:16:20.44 The father in the book doesn't have a role.
03:16:20.44 --> 03:16:24.44 Now, you might think I'm a, you know, bad person for not giving the father the role.
03:16:24.44 --> 03:16:28.44 But, you know, the jjitsu, all he says, there's one line about the father in the book.
03:16:28.44 --> 03:16:33.44 He says, my dad's gone a lot with work and stuff.
03:16:33.44 --> 03:16:36.44 It's that ambiguous.
03:16:36.44 --> 03:16:39.44 And there's a couple reasons why I did that.
03:16:39.44 --> 03:16:43.44 And the number one reason is because not everyone, not every kid has got a dad.
03:16:43.44 --> 03:16:45.44 I mean, what you're saying is actually very real.
03:16:45.44 --> 03:16:46.44 Yeah.
03:16:46.44 --> 03:16:49.44 You know, and a lot of kids have to just deal with,
03:16:49.44 --> 03:16:52.44 oh, yeah, my father's not around much.
03:16:52.44 --> 03:16:53.44 Yeah, you know.
03:16:53.44 --> 03:16:55.44 And that's why I did it.
03:16:55.44 --> 03:16:57.44 And there's another subtle reason.
03:16:57.44 --> 03:17:01.44 And, you know, without going into too much crazy detail,
03:17:01.44 --> 03:17:04.44 the lead character in the book is named as Mark.
03:17:04.44 --> 03:17:09.44 And he's actually named after Mark Lee who was one of my guys,
03:17:09.44 --> 03:17:14.44 just incredible, incredible person, incredible warrior,
03:17:14.44 --> 03:17:16.44 and he was killed in Iraq.
03:17:16.44 --> 03:17:20.44 And, you know, he was, he never did.
03:17:20.44 --> 03:17:22.44 His mom raised him.
03:17:22.44 --> 03:17:26.44 And, you know, so it was my way of saying, look,
03:17:26.44 --> 03:17:28.44 you know, not everyone has a dad.
03:17:28.44 --> 03:17:32.44 And in the book, he's got a strong uncle that comes in and helps him.
03:17:32.44 --> 03:17:34.44 But at the end of the book, his uncle points out to them.
03:17:34.44 --> 03:17:36.44 He says, who's going to help me now?
03:17:36.44 --> 03:17:40.44 And his uncle says to him, look, you don't need to,
03:17:40.44 --> 03:17:42.44 you know what the right things to do are.
03:17:42.44 --> 03:17:44.44 You know how to stay on the right path.
03:17:44.44 --> 03:17:46.44 You don't need someone to hold your hand all the time.
03:17:46.44 --> 03:17:48.44 You can make this happen for yourself.
03:17:48.44 --> 03:17:50.44 And that's my, the message, you know,
03:17:50.44 --> 03:17:52.44 that I'm trying to get across to kids that might not have a dad.
03:17:52.44 --> 03:17:54.44 They might not have an uncle.
03:17:54.44 --> 03:17:55.44 They might not have a mom.
03:17:55.44 --> 03:17:58.44 But you can find out what the right path is.
03:17:58.44 --> 03:17:59.44 You can get on it.
03:17:59.44 --> 03:18:00.44 You can stay on it.
03:18:00.44 --> 03:18:02.44 And that's, that's why I wrote the book that way.
03:18:02.44 --> 03:18:04.44 And, and you know, it's, it's interesting because I've got
03:18:04.44 --> 03:18:08.44 asked many times over the years, you know, about what do you think about
03:18:08.44 --> 03:18:11.44 fatherhood and, and the important roles that father's play.
03:18:11.44 --> 03:18:13.44 And again, you know, I go back to, for instance,
03:18:13.44 --> 03:18:15.44 Mark Lees, a great example of a kid that was raised.
03:18:15.44 --> 03:18:16.44 And have a dad.
03:18:16.44 --> 03:18:20.44 And his mom's a strong woman and a, and a incredible person.
03:18:20.44 --> 03:18:21.44 And she raised a warrior.
03:18:21.44 --> 03:18:24.44 So that's why I did that in that book.
03:18:24.44 --> 03:18:26.44 And you know, another thing I did in that book is, you know,
03:18:26.44 --> 03:18:29.44 Gigietsu plays a prominent role, but you could replace that with wrestling,
03:18:29.44 --> 03:18:34.44 with boxing, with, with Moitai, but Gigietsu is really a big part of it.
03:18:34.44 --> 03:18:39.44 But so is studying, you know, learning, learning how to learn.
03:18:39.44 --> 03:18:44.44 And, and, and as a kid seeing what the opportunity is in being educated,
03:18:44.44 --> 03:18:46.44 because a lot of kids, myself included when you're going to school,
03:18:46.44 --> 03:18:49.44 when you're 10 years old or 15 years old, you don't care.
03:18:49.44 --> 03:18:51.44 You just don't care.
03:18:51.44 --> 03:18:56.44 And it's, I want, I want kids to realize that it's beneficial to get
03:18:56.44 --> 03:18:59.44 stronger, faster, smarter, and better.
03:18:59.44 --> 03:19:04.44 So that's it way of the warrior kid, get it, and get it for your local library,
03:19:04.44 --> 03:19:09.44 too, because they need it, because there's some kid that will grab that book
03:19:09.44 --> 03:19:12.44 in the library and you'll get him on the right path.
03:19:12.44 --> 03:19:15.44 Also, discipline equals freedom, field manual.
03:19:15.44 --> 03:19:20.44 You can find it by itself in the get after it's section.
03:19:20.44 --> 03:19:24.44 Of any bookstore or online book retailer.
03:19:24.44 --> 03:19:26.44 If you look in the get after it's section, this is a big empty shelf.
03:19:26.44 --> 03:19:28.44 There's a one book that's called this,
03:19:28.44 --> 03:19:30.44 Plunicos Freedom Field Manual.
03:19:30.44 --> 03:19:33.44 We have to start petitioning now to make that happen at Amazon.
03:19:33.44 --> 03:19:37.44 They just need like, when you drop down business, lifestyle, health and fitness,
03:19:37.44 --> 03:19:38.44 get it after it's a boom.
03:19:38.44 --> 03:19:39.44 There's that one book.
03:19:39.44 --> 03:19:42.44 They better get in the game.
03:19:42.44 --> 03:19:44.44 And,
03:19:44.44 --> 03:19:47.44 also there's extreme ownership.
03:19:47.44 --> 03:19:50.44 They're a book that kind of started all of this stuff, by the way.
03:19:50.44 --> 03:19:51.44 Thanks, appreciate it.
03:19:51.44 --> 03:19:55.44 It's about leadership, and it's about combat,
03:19:55.44 --> 03:19:59.44 and it's about taking fucking responsibility, and it's about taking responsibility.
03:19:59.44 --> 03:20:01.44 And that's fucking huge.
03:20:01.44 --> 03:20:02.44 That's huge.
03:20:02.44 --> 03:20:08.44 That's something that I think is one of the hardest things for most people to do.
03:20:08.44 --> 03:20:12.44 And you know, I actually highlighted that a bunch of times in your book,
03:20:12.44 --> 03:20:16.44 where you're kind of explaining things that
03:20:16.44 --> 03:20:17.44 you're talking about,
03:20:17.44 --> 03:20:20.44 I guess you would say maybe resulted in something happening in bad in your life,
03:20:20.44 --> 03:20:22.44 and you'd say, hey, this happened, and this happened, and this happened,
03:20:22.44 --> 03:20:24.44 and every time you went, laid that out,
03:20:24.44 --> 03:20:25.44 at the end of it, you'd say,
03:20:25.44 --> 03:20:27.44 but it's my fault.
03:20:27.44 --> 03:20:30.44 And I should have done, I made this happen to myself.
03:20:30.44 --> 03:20:33.44 So it's pretty, and you wrote this book before,
03:20:33.44 --> 03:20:34.44 you probably write this to me,
03:20:34.44 --> 03:20:36.44 and I know you were writing this book the same to our,
03:20:36.44 --> 03:20:39.44 I was writing that book when I was basically fucking trying to kill myself,
03:20:39.44 --> 03:20:42.44 drugs and everything else is when I started it.
03:20:42.44 --> 03:20:47.44 And even in that state, you always say, you know, it's my fault.
03:20:47.44 --> 03:20:50.44 I should have, you know, hey, my dad always make a habit
03:20:50.44 --> 03:20:52.44 out of looking for other people to blame.
03:20:52.44 --> 03:20:59.44 I mean, it's important to identify the roots of the problem
03:20:59.44 --> 03:21:02.44 and so on, and what made you the way you are,
03:21:02.44 --> 03:21:05.44 so you can fix them exactly.
03:21:05.44 --> 03:21:07.44 So now, exactly.
03:21:07.44 --> 03:21:11.44 And a big part of being a man is accepting responsibility
03:21:11.44 --> 03:21:13.44 for your fuck-ups.
03:21:13.44 --> 03:21:15.44 Yeah, and I thought that was awesome.
03:21:15.44 --> 03:21:17.44 You know, and again, you know,
03:21:17.44 --> 03:21:21.44 when you were talking about what you learned from your dad
03:21:21.44 --> 03:21:24.44 not being around, and then how you apply that to help other kids
03:21:24.44 --> 03:21:26.44 that are in that situation, teaching them to jitsu
03:21:26.44 --> 03:21:28.44 and take care of them and build relationships
03:21:28.44 --> 03:21:30.44 the best you can with your kids and with other kids
03:21:30.44 --> 03:21:34.44 that around man, that's exactly what you're talking about.
03:21:34.44 --> 03:21:37.44 So that's extreme ownership,
03:21:37.44 --> 03:21:40.44 and also don't hoard the knowledge.
03:21:40.44 --> 03:21:43.44 You might think, hey, I'm going to get extreme ownership
03:21:43.44 --> 03:21:44.44 for myself.
03:21:44.44 --> 03:21:45.44 I'm going to read it at night,
03:21:45.44 --> 03:21:46.44 and then I'm going to become a good leader,
03:21:46.44 --> 03:21:47.44 and I'm going to do better at work.
03:21:47.44 --> 03:21:48.44 Don't do that.
03:21:48.44 --> 03:21:49.44 That's the wrong move.
03:21:49.44 --> 03:21:51.44 What you want to do is you want to actually distribute it
03:21:51.44 --> 03:21:52.44 to your team.
03:21:52.44 --> 03:21:53.44 Yeah.
03:21:53.44 --> 03:21:54.44 And that way they all get on board,
03:21:54.44 --> 03:21:55.44 and now the whole team starts kicking ass.
03:21:55.44 --> 03:21:57.44 That's what you want to do.
03:21:57.44 --> 03:21:59.44 Up and down the chain of command.
03:21:59.44 --> 03:22:01.44 Then if you need more than that,
03:22:01.44 --> 03:22:03.44 you can hire our leadership and management consulting company

03:22:37.44 --> 03:22:40.44 If you missed it, come to Texas.

03:22:42.44 --> 03:22:45.44 Omni Barton Creek, resort and spa.
03:22:45.44 --> 03:22:47.44 And again, forget about the spa.
03:22:47.44 --> 03:22:48.44 You're not going to spa.
03:22:48.44 --> 03:22:49.44 Don't come for the spa.
03:22:49.44 --> 03:22:50.44 Not happening.
03:22:50.44 --> 03:22:52.44 But what we'll be happening is leadership.
03:22:52.44 --> 03:22:55.44 We'll talk about combat leadership and how to apply that
03:22:55.44 --> 03:22:57.44 to your business and to your life.
03:22:57.44 --> 03:22:58.44 And if you can't make Texas,
03:22:58.44 --> 03:23:00.44 okay, we got backup.
03:23:00.44 --> 03:23:02.44 We got contingency operations.
03:23:02.44 --> 03:23:03.44 If you can't come to Texas,
03:23:03.44 --> 03:23:05.44 September 14th and 15th,
03:23:05.44 --> 03:23:09.44 we will be back in San Diego on my home turf.
03:23:09.44 --> 03:23:10.44 Where there is no winter.
03:23:10.44 --> 03:23:13.44 We got big yards and barbecue spoiled mother.
03:23:13.44 --> 03:23:14.44 First floor.
03:23:14.44 --> 03:23:16.44 And that's a regular like it.
03:23:16.44 --> 03:23:18.44 It's alright.
03:23:18.44 --> 03:23:20.44 You're entitled to be spoiled at this point in your life.
03:23:20.44 --> 03:23:21.44 It's, I'll take it.
03:23:21.44 --> 03:23:23.44 I'll give you a pass on that.
03:23:23.44 --> 03:23:25.44 Until the monsters,
03:23:25.44 --> 03:23:28.44 we can be found actually on the interwebs.
03:23:28.44 --> 03:23:31.44 On Twitter, on Instagram.
03:23:31.44 --> 03:23:33.44 It in the Facebook.
03:23:33.44 --> 03:23:35.44 Okay, I'm going to find it there.
03:23:35.44 --> 03:23:39.44 Hardly is at Harley F.
03:23:39.44 --> 03:23:41.44 Flanagan.
03:23:41.44 --> 03:23:45.44 In Flanagan to spelled F.L.A.N.A.
03:23:45.44 --> 03:23:47.44 G.A.N.
03:23:47.44 --> 03:23:49.44 Harley F. Flanagan.
03:23:49.44 --> 03:23:52.44 Echo is at Echo Charles and I am at
03:23:52.44 --> 03:23:54.44 Jocca Willink.
03:23:54.44 --> 03:23:57.44 Echo, you got anything else?
03:23:57.44 --> 03:23:58.44 Nope, that's it.
03:23:58.44 --> 03:24:00.44 Man, my pleasure.
03:24:00.44 --> 03:24:03.44 Gentlemen, it was real pleasure.
03:24:03.44 --> 03:24:05.44 Absolutely.
03:24:05.44 --> 03:24:07.44 Any other closing comments you want to make?
03:24:07.44 --> 03:24:12.44 I definitely wouldn't advise smoking, PCP.
03:24:12.44 --> 03:24:15.44 Taking a list, not seriously.
03:24:15.44 --> 03:24:18.44 No, thanks for having me on, man.
03:24:18.44 --> 03:24:20.44 It's real pleasure.
03:24:20.44 --> 03:24:25.44 You know, you become a big inspiration.
03:24:25.44 --> 03:24:27.44 I love reading.
03:24:27.44 --> 03:24:34.44 You're quotes in your books and listening in the podcast.
03:24:34.44 --> 03:24:39.44 Sometimes it's exactly the kick in the ass that I need.
03:24:39.44 --> 03:24:42.44 And I appreciate that.
03:24:42.44 --> 03:24:49.44 And again, I'm very honored and proud to have been part of the soundtrack to your life.
03:24:49.44 --> 03:24:50.44 Indeed.
03:24:50.44 --> 03:24:51.44 Yes, indeed.
03:24:51.44 --> 03:24:56.44 I'd also like to give a shout out to my better half who,
03:24:56.44 --> 03:24:59.44 now her, I definitely wouldn't be doing so well.
03:24:59.44 --> 03:25:01.44 My book would not be as good.
03:25:01.44 --> 03:25:02.44 It would probably suck.
03:25:02.44 --> 03:25:04.44 And my life would definitely suck.
03:25:04.44 --> 03:25:07.44 So Laura Lee Flanagan, I love you.
03:25:07.44 --> 03:25:11.44 And if my sons are listening to this podcast,
03:25:11.44 --> 03:25:18.44 I love you boys and keep up all the good work and keep you training going.
03:25:18.44 --> 03:25:21.44 And keep checking out Jocca Will's podcast.
03:25:21.44 --> 03:25:24.44 You might learn a thing or two.
03:25:24.44 --> 03:25:30.44 Awesome. Well, partly obviously, thanks for coming on the show and such a pleasure, man.
03:25:30.44 --> 03:25:39.44 Thanks for the years of music that you gave to me and millions of other kids that
03:25:39.44 --> 03:25:42.44 needed to hear it.
03:25:42.44 --> 03:25:48.44 And thanks for making it through what you've made it through and coming out on the other side with a
03:25:48.44 --> 03:26:01.44 positive outlook and a positive impact and a positive message that it's never too late
03:26:01.44 --> 03:26:11.44 that it's never too dark and that we can always turn things around.
03:26:11.44 --> 03:26:17.44 As long as you're alive, there is hope.
03:26:17.44 --> 03:26:19.44 Yes, indeed.
03:26:19.44 --> 03:26:21.44 Thanks to everyone else.
03:26:21.44 --> 03:26:32.44 That's listening and supporting and spreading the word and as always to the folks in the military out there.
03:26:32.44 --> 03:26:40.44 We salute you and thank you all for holding the demons at the gate.
03:26:40.44 --> 03:26:47.44 And to the police and law enforcement and firefighters and EMTs and first responders.
03:26:47.44 --> 03:26:52.44 Thanks for fighting the demons here at home.
03:26:52.44 --> 03:26:59.44 And to anyone else that's out there that's listening.
03:26:59.44 --> 03:27:05.44 That's started to go down.
03:27:05.44 --> 03:27:23.44 And that hole down into that mall trapped in the chains of depression or addiction or rage.
03:27:23.44 --> 03:27:34.44 When you're down in that hole, look up.
03:27:34.44 --> 03:27:38.44 And recognize that there is a way out.
03:27:38.44 --> 03:27:42.44 There is a path for you to take.
03:27:42.44 --> 03:27:46.44 And it's not an easy path.
03:27:46.44 --> 03:27:48.44 It'll be a fight.
03:27:48.44 --> 03:27:56.44 It'll be a fight that demands focus and work and tenacity.
03:27:56.44 --> 03:28:01.44 And of course discipline.
03:28:01.44 --> 03:28:07.44 But it is that path.
03:28:07.44 --> 03:28:19.44 That hard path, that hard path of discipline that will lead you to freedom.
03:28:19.44 --> 03:28:24.44 So stay on that path.
03:28:24.44 --> 03:28:33.44 And until next time, this is Harley Flanagan, Andeko, and Jocco.
03:28:33.44 --> 03:28:55.44 Oh.
