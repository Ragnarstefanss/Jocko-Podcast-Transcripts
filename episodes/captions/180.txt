[00:00:00] This is Jockel Podcast number 180.
[00:00:03] With echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink.
[00:00:06] Good evening, echo. Good evening.
[00:00:08] It was May 1968.
[00:00:13] We were triple volunteers.
[00:00:16] We had volunteered and graduated from the Army's parachute jump school at Fort Benning, Georgia.
[00:00:21] Made it through the qualification course at the Special Forces Training Group in Fort Bragg, North Carolina.
[00:00:27] And after attending the fifth Special Forces Group airborne in-country training program,
[00:00:32] we had volunteered to serve in Mac V. Sogs, Command and Control.
[00:00:39] During Special Forces Training at Fort Bragg, several of the green berets teaching various
[00:00:43] courses told us to avoid C and C because the duty was rough and the Special Forces casualties
[00:00:50] were high in the top secret unit.
[00:00:55] Despite all those warnings, Rick Howard, John McIntyre, Rick Estes, Tony Horell, Mark
[00:01:03] Gentry, Bob Garcia, Bobby D. Letters, myself and a few others volunteered to serve in C and C.
[00:01:13] I'd been in training or in between training cycles since entering the Army on one December
[00:01:18] 1966. In May 1968, we were finally shifting gears from being in a training mode to an operational
[00:01:26] mode. None of the rumors prepared us for what followed.
[00:01:32] You won't need those. The sergeant major said, put away all pens, pencils and notebooks.
[00:01:37] This is a top secret briefing. All of you have either obtained a top secret clearance or
[00:01:42] will do so in the near future or you wouldn't be here.
[00:01:46] Welcome to the Command and Control Detachment of the Fifth Special Forces Group Airborne.
[00:01:50] First Special Forces United States Army Special Operations Augmentation Study and Observation
[00:01:56] Group or simply C and C.
[00:02:00] Gentlemen, before you is a confidentiality agreement. You can't tell your girlfriend, your
[00:02:06] mother, no one.
[00:02:10] We were prohibited from writing anything about the operation forbidden from keeping
[00:02:14] diaries taking photos, making drawings or tape recordings, notes of any sort.
[00:02:20] The sergeant major advised us that anyone who didn't want to sign that agreement could
[00:02:23] leave.
[00:02:26] Gentlemen, the sergeant major turned toward a generic map on the wall. The North Vietnamese
[00:02:31] Army controls these neutral countries.
[00:02:35] And pointed to Cambodia and Louss, located to the west of the Republic of South Vietnam,
[00:02:39] and of course, North Vietnam. For several years, the North Vietnamese Army had moved soldiers,
[00:02:45] supplies, rockets, guns, and propaganda south into the eastern provinces of neutral,
[00:02:51] Louss and Cambodia, through an ever-increasing network of trails and roads called the Ho Chi
[00:02:57] Men Trail Complex.
[00:03:02] Now listen up real close, the sergeant major said, when you go across the fence, you
[00:03:07] will carry no identification of any manner, shape, or form.
[00:03:12] That meant no identification papers, no dog tags, no diaries, no photos, no love letters,
[00:03:17] and certainly no green berets.
[00:03:20] Everyone would wear sterile fatigues with no company insignia, no name tags, no unit designators,
[00:03:26] no jump wings, or combat infantrymen badges.
[00:03:32] Why? Without giving anyone a chance to respond, he said that because Louss and Cambodia
[00:03:37] were neutral, United States government could publicly proclaim that the US repres respected
[00:03:43] that neutrality. Thus, if we were killed in Louss, Cambodia or North Vietnam, the US government
[00:03:49] would deny having anything to do with us.
[00:03:53] United States government would explain that no Americans were stationed in Louss or Cambodia,
[00:03:58] which was technically accurate.
[00:04:01] The US government had a plausible deniability if we were killed or captured.
[00:04:08] And if captured, we were to speak of foreign language.
[00:04:12] Don't tell them who you are, he ordered.
[00:04:15] Remember, technically, under the terms and conditions of the Geneva Accords, your status
[00:04:19] is different than Air Force and Navy pilots shot down over North Vietnam, they're in uniform.
[00:04:25] Their identify as US servicemen.
[00:04:28] CNC men don't fall into the category of prisoners of war.
[00:04:34] We were, in effect, spies, although the sergeant major never used that word.
[00:04:41] He also didn't tell us that spies had no protection under the Geneva Convention and that
[00:04:47] we could some are rarely be executed if captured.
[00:04:55] And that right there, that's some excerpts from the beginning of a book called Across the
[00:05:01] Fence, which is written by a special forces soldier in Vietnam named John Stryker
[00:05:09] Meyer.
[00:05:12] And in this particular case, it is an absolute honor for me to say that we have him here
[00:05:20] with us tonight to teach us about his experiences as a member of Mac Vesog, studies and
[00:05:27] observations, command group, command and control teams.
[00:05:33] Sir?
[00:05:34] Welcome.
[00:05:35] Welcome to the show.
[00:05:37] Glad to be here.
[00:05:39] That's quite a welcome.
[00:05:40] You got the Vietnam, huh?
[00:05:41] Yes, it was quite something, absolutely.
[00:05:44] And at the time we just watched the John Wayne movie to Green Barais on top of it all.
[00:05:49] So we were all psyched.
[00:05:51] We're seeing the movie we're ready.
[00:05:53] That's all it takes.
[00:05:54] And we have been for warned, you know, when you go there, this is going to happen.
[00:05:57] Little guy is going to come out and ask for people to volunteer.
[00:05:59] So we said, yeah, right.
[00:06:01] Now, when we were done, it happened before the shift to say our little guy goes out,
[00:06:05] we're looking for volunteers.
[00:06:07] And then Johnny Mac goes, for what sergeant can't tell you either you're in or you're
[00:06:12] not.
[00:06:13] So we raised her hands.
[00:06:14] Next day we're up in denying for that briefing you covered.
[00:06:16] Yeah, how do you end up in a military?
[00:06:20] Where'd you grow up?
[00:06:21] You grew up in Jersey?
[00:06:22] Yeah, grew up in Trenton, New Jersey.
[00:06:25] Dad was a milk man, grew up in the milk truck.
[00:06:27] And my mom was a piano teacher, choir organist.
[00:06:31] And after high school, it took me two years to flunk out a college.
[00:06:38] Upon flunking out in 1966, I was working up here 70 in National Park.
[00:06:43] Oh, nice.
[00:06:44] Yeah, the garbage man firing man up there.
[00:06:46] And the book, the green brace came out.
[00:06:49] And my dad is sent me a letter saying, hey, that's it.
[00:06:51] You've finally flunked out.
[00:06:53] You're going to get drafted.
[00:06:54] We got the notification here from the draft board.
[00:06:56] So I read the book and I said, you know what, if I'm going to go, if I can get in with
[00:06:59] these guys, that'd be a great challenge.
[00:07:02] And if I can do that, that's the way I want to go.
[00:07:05] Because at that time, with the army, eight weeks of basic training, eight weeks of advanced
[00:07:10] infantry, a month leaving, you're in Vietnam.
[00:07:12] You could be with any regular conventional unit.
[00:07:16] But at that time, there had been a story about some issues, particularly when the
[00:07:20] were engaged in the regular North Vietnamese army, that there were have some major issues,
[00:07:25] and surprises to how strong the enemy was.
[00:07:27] So give me some more training.
[00:07:30] I needed it.
[00:07:31] And when you were a kid, did you play sports or anything like that?
[00:07:35] Yeah, I was never that good at it.
[00:07:38] But I loved baseball, was a head game, and football.
[00:07:42] And my dad wouldn't let me play football to my senior year of high school.
[00:07:46] So I had one year of football, but everything else was just like J.V.
[00:07:50] Little League, just love baseball.
[00:07:52] Where do you want your play football?
[00:07:53] Do you want you to hit in the head too much?
[00:07:55] They didn't care about that.
[00:07:58] Did they?
[00:07:59] You know what, I think it was more, well, in eighth grade, I heard my knee playing soccer.
[00:08:03] I said it were worried about follow up injuries here, and still have your body in one piece
[00:08:07] when you go to college or wherever you're going to go.
[00:08:11] So they were very conservative.
[00:08:13] I mean, my mom, she's no foreign girl from Central Jersey, and she was really unhappy
[00:08:20] when my granddad gave me a cap pistol.
[00:08:23] So that's the household we grew up in.
[00:08:26] But you know, eventually we went out, learned about weapons a little bit along the way,
[00:08:31] and then of course when this came along, do we got to real deal?
[00:08:34] And so in 1966, so public opinion wasn't completely against the war yet.
[00:08:41] It was in 1966?
[00:08:42] No, but it was beginning.
[00:08:43] It was starting.
[00:08:44] It was starting.
[00:08:45] You had people doing their protest and letters to Yatter, and some of the fringe elements
[00:08:51] have society like we see today.
[00:08:53] Some of those parallels.
[00:08:55] But you going down, how did your parents, your dad was on board, obviously, because he
[00:09:00] sent you the letter saying, all right, buddy.
[00:09:02] Yeah, what's the school that you think?
[00:09:04] What school did you think out of?
[00:09:05] Yeah, try and stay college.
[00:09:07] Yeah.
[00:09:08] How are you just said, I'm going to go to your ceremony to be a firefighter?
[00:09:11] Well, we had a couple of buddies of mine that I've been in college with helped me flunk
[00:09:15] out.
[00:09:17] And we did much, much serious drinking just stupid young, young, young, dumb.
[00:09:22] And the idea what you're talking about.
[00:09:24] Yeah, I'm sure.
[00:09:28] So they had a crop congressman that got us jobs in your semides.
[00:09:33] It's a good old Frank Thompson came through for us. He drove across and in fact, in Manhattan
[00:09:40] Kansas, we got hit with tornado, June 12th going across the Rocky Mountains.
[00:09:44] We had snow with a back window blowing out of the car.
[00:09:47] So it was just fun.
[00:09:48] Yeah.
[00:09:49] In a nice experience, again, we drank a little bit too much there.
[00:09:52] But the first time we were able to job real money and then the reality check, it was just
[00:09:56] like these guys are amazing.
[00:09:59] I mean, if I could get even close to this to get the jump school, at least get a taste of this.
[00:10:03] So that was the plan.
[00:10:04] How was the culture shock when you rolled into Army boot camp?
[00:10:09] Well, but at the time, I've seen a couple dozen of the movies over time from the World
[00:10:13] World War II movies.
[00:10:14] It kind of knew what was coming.
[00:10:16] So early on, I had a friend of mine who's dad had been in New York.
[00:10:24] He goes, you go in.
[00:10:26] Just remember, this is like a game.
[00:10:28] They want to see if they can break your knot and you just got to have the right mindset.
[00:10:32] That stuck with me.
[00:10:33] So through basic, particularly with jump school, they come in and shake you out of bed
[00:10:37] to a clock in the morning for bogus inspections.
[00:10:39] Just to see if they could mess you up or break you a little bit.
[00:10:43] Kind of like, okay, we all noticed this is a game.
[00:10:45] We all know we're training here.
[00:10:47] And so that was the way we moved forward.
[00:10:49] And you guys could go right into the, you guys, you could go right into the QCourse.
[00:10:53] Like you could just do that pipeline.
[00:10:54] It was open for you.
[00:10:55] Well, because we lost so many people, they came out at that time, we called the baby
[00:10:59] SF course.
[00:11:01] So yes.
[00:11:03] And even to this day, some of the guys that went through training group with are still
[00:11:07] down a brag now training SF guys.
[00:11:10] And we're biased.
[00:11:12] But we feel that if you come through basic advanced jump school and go right into the QCourse
[00:11:19] and qualify, now I have a pre-qualification, then your qualification, and then you get
[00:11:24] the bere.
[00:11:25] That there's no bad habits.
[00:11:29] Like a lot of the sergeants for the old days when they came in, you had to be an E5 above
[00:11:34] more time and grade, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:11:37] And before they be even considerate, but they need a bodies.
[00:11:42] Well, the guys, again, were biased.
[00:11:45] So let me get the bias out front.
[00:11:47] As the green kids that came in, that went off the day to job.
[00:11:51] And eventually it saw, by 68 and 69, the majority of the ones, zeros, team leaders were
[00:11:58] young guys.
[00:11:59] And there's a lot of us that either got bored, like a miccase, flunked out, or just wanted
[00:12:05] some different, something different.
[00:12:07] And it said, this is special forces.
[00:12:09] And then you get the rumors.
[00:12:10] And then you finally get to that briefing where you say, here's a chance to volunteer.
[00:12:14] It's a little de-realized.
[00:12:15] There's the highest casualty operation in the entire world.
[00:12:18] But they forgot to tell you.
[00:12:19] They didn't tell you that part.
[00:12:22] So did you volunteer for CNC while you were still state-sided?
[00:12:25] Was that once you got overseas?
[00:12:27] No, at that time, the only way you could get it in the special forces, or that program was
[00:12:31] to list for airborne on a signed.
[00:12:35] And then when you went through basic, then the vancimitriot, you would be offered the
[00:12:42] opportunity to volunteer.
[00:12:44] So during one of the classes, they would have, you know, like, in my case, it was a rainy
[00:12:49] day where in the gym, there's like 607 of people sitting on the floor.
[00:12:53] And they had a stage of front-wood side steps.
[00:12:56] And a cook would come up and say, hey, the coolest MOS, you'll never go hung you with
[00:13:00] us.
[00:13:01] And they're all fat and sloppy, you know, just a couple of times.
[00:13:04] And then other guys coming for commo, Intel, MPs, that kind of stuff.
[00:13:09] At the very end, this little banty rooster comes in.
[00:13:12] It was raining.
[00:13:13] So everybody else had to rain jackets and stuff on.
[00:13:15] This banty rooster comes in with a buray and his fatigues are wet.
[00:13:20] He came up and did a straight jump on the stage, turned around and said, we're looking
[00:13:26] for a recruits for special forces.
[00:13:28] If you're interested in seeing me outside, in fact, anybody interested?
[00:13:31] Well, hell, I read the book.
[00:13:33] I jumped up off the floor.
[00:13:35] Me about three other guys.
[00:13:36] And the other seven hundred just sat there.
[00:13:38] I'm going to like, WTF.
[00:13:40] You guys are going to nom the couple weeks.
[00:13:42] I'm going to get this a little bit more trained there.
[00:13:46] It was just amazing.
[00:13:47] So he jumped off the stage.
[00:13:48] Now it's it.
[00:13:49] So he ran us through the cycle of a test.
[00:13:50] Had to show we could swim, run, all that stuff.
[00:13:54] And then when you were comm guy initially, did you get trained as a comm guy?
[00:13:57] Yes.
[00:13:58] Is it, was it, was it, was it still called 18 echo back then?
[00:13:59] No, no, this is prehistoric guy.
[00:14:01] Go 5B for us.
[00:14:03] The 4S is the SF designator.
[00:14:05] God, and O5B is commomores code.
[00:14:09] And then after a training group, they sent us down for 12.
[00:14:12] Weeks to 4Gordon for RTT.
[00:14:15] Because they need a lot of A camps.
[00:14:17] And of course, C and C needed some RTT operators.
[00:14:20] Radio tell it.
[00:14:21] And so that was the extra training.
[00:14:24] And that's where I got busted.
[00:14:25] Me and Johnny McIntyre got busted down to private.
[00:14:28] He do so.
[00:14:30] We landed and not.
[00:14:31] Where did you reach the new to our nine?
[00:14:33] Well, we were just asked holes really.
[00:14:35] I mean, these are, these are butter bars.
[00:14:37] Two young Nutenists that get this company.
[00:14:39] And here come these green berets.
[00:14:40] We just got done all our training.
[00:14:42] We're official green berets.
[00:14:43] You're the baddest man on the planet.
[00:14:45] That's over your body.
[00:14:47] Yeah.
[00:14:49] So when I have my article 15 hearing with the CO, I go in.
[00:14:52] And there's eight article 15s on the tail.
[00:14:54] It says pick one.
[00:14:55] If I picked one, scrusted up and threw it at me.
[00:14:57] Because you got nine now.
[00:14:59] And I got me a Macatar got busted.
[00:15:02] So is he do's landed in knobs and he do's.
[00:15:05] Oh, yeah.
[00:15:06] Yeah.
[00:15:07] So you get to, so it wasn't until you got to Vietnam.
[00:15:11] Correct.
[00:15:12] What about CNC?
[00:15:13] Or no, you said some training instructors.
[00:15:14] Right.
[00:15:15] And he told you like they don't do a comma.
[00:15:16] Well, you know, here, one of these little side bars.
[00:15:19] And we go through comma myself, Macatar and few us got recycled.
[00:15:23] Because you had to get up to, I figured, 12 or 15 groups were limited or something.
[00:15:28] For a minute, yeah.
[00:15:29] WPMs.
[00:15:30] Yeah.
[00:15:31] And two at the.
[00:15:32] Is that right?
[00:15:33] I went through a course.
[00:15:34] Like when the last guys that were learning Morris code and we had to get whatever
[00:15:37] it was.
[00:15:38] I think we had a lower standard than that.
[00:15:39] Because we, because it was just no one would have bought it.
[00:15:42] You want to even officers, then.
[00:15:43] You couldn't give you the officer out of the room.
[00:15:48] So no, but one of our guys who took us under his wing was a guy named Paul Villarosa,
[00:15:52] SFC, been in non-three times, had a little tattoo around his neck.
[00:15:56] Cut here.
[00:15:58] And but he helped us.
[00:16:00] He got us gone.
[00:16:01] So in our mind, he and we had a widener in Russo, two other instructors for the
[00:16:05] O5B.
[00:16:07] And so one thing got to know is near the end.
[00:16:09] It's like, hey, you guys go, don't do this.
[00:16:12] Followed, cheers stuff.
[00:16:13] Get an A camp.
[00:16:14] Turned about the people.
[00:16:15] Blah, blah, blah, blah.
[00:16:16] Okay.
[00:16:17] That's what it came down to.
[00:16:18] So when we get that briefing, the top secret briefing and one of the first things we hear about
[00:16:22] from Scuddlebut, Paul Villarosa was KIA.
[00:16:25] The first KIA out of FB4 at the time, which was in January of 68.
[00:16:32] So here's one of our living legends who got us in the SFC, trained us up.
[00:16:37] It's KIA.
[00:16:38] And that had us, you know, talked about science.
[00:16:41] It hit hard.
[00:16:43] But so that was in Vietnam when they now said to you, okay, do you want to be a part
[00:16:48] of this other program?
[00:16:49] Right.
[00:16:50] Do you want to go one more volunteer route and then up here?
[00:16:53] Yes, of course you're like, yeah, let's bring it.
[00:16:55] Let's go.
[00:16:56] Young and dumb.
[00:16:58] And then so then you immediately got us signed.
[00:17:04] Right.
[00:17:05] Let's do screen, you anything else, they just said, okay, you're smart enough to volunteer.
[00:17:09] Yeah, that's what you were talking about.
[00:17:11] All the vetting had been done.
[00:17:12] And all of us either had the top secret or it was in process.
[00:17:17] And so from near, literally, next day, a plane to Denang up north and then we had the briefing.
[00:17:25] And of course, you know, we had a safe house at Denang where there's House 22, that's
[00:17:29] our safe house.
[00:17:31] And walking to special forces.
[00:17:33] And that was the safe house that was run by either us or the agency or both.
[00:17:40] And you know, you go in and here's old SF guys.
[00:17:44] In fact, there was one of the teams that just got back from trying to arrest you one of
[00:17:49] our hatchet forces.
[00:17:50] And there was a sit and they're talking about the combat and Mac and I said, we're going,
[00:17:54] oh, shit, we're going to really die.
[00:17:56] It's a good thing we spent our money.
[00:17:58] We were going through the RTA training.
[00:18:04] We had a weekend pass.
[00:18:05] We go up in Washington when we see the Tata offensive and the tanks are running over Lang
[00:18:09] Bay, the A camp at Lang Bay, A 101.
[00:18:13] We know we're going to die.
[00:18:15] We're high degree of certainty.
[00:18:16] So we went home, took our money out of the bank.
[00:18:19] All of our princely earnings of $1,000 to a state dinner until you went to Vietnam.
[00:18:24] So there we were at this house 22 and we're thinking about the same thing as going, oh, shit,
[00:18:29] we're really into it now.
[00:18:31] And so we go upstairs, take showers and then the showers, the couple of these hookers that
[00:18:34] are in there, do you know, with Coke, Coca-Cola.
[00:18:38] Yeah.
[00:18:39] And they're clean up just like welcoming you here a couple of guys getting a load in the
[00:18:42] back there and they're all pumping away.
[00:18:44] It's like, oh, this is really cool.
[00:18:46] They're just about this side of Vietnam.
[00:18:50] Here we go.
[00:18:51] Yeah.
[00:18:52] So bring it on.
[00:18:53] We're ready.
[00:18:54] And then you talk about that flight up to the first place you got to sign was Fab 1.
[00:19:00] Yeah.
[00:19:01] So we always call it an F.O.B.
[00:19:03] You guys call it Fab and you get a generation.
[00:19:06] I guess we're cutting corners over here.
[00:19:07] Okay.
[00:19:08] So you're going to F.O.B.1.
[00:19:10] Call anything like still giving you late for supper.
[00:19:12] Well, there's a whole, there's a whole offshoot of the word F.O.B.
[00:19:17] Which we turned into Fab.
[00:19:19] Have you ever heard the turn Fab it before?
[00:19:21] Yes.
[00:19:22] So someone that stays on the fob and never goes out.
[00:19:24] Yeah.
[00:19:25] So known as REMS.
[00:19:28] Yeah.
[00:19:29] Well, yes, the REMS is what you guys call them and I don't know if the name of my consultant
[00:19:34] company is actually on front.
[00:19:36] And the reason we called the company actually on front is because we wanted people know
[00:19:40] that we were the guys that were like in the front, not the REMS.
[00:19:44] Which is specifically taken from David Hack where it's book.
[00:19:47] Indeed.
[00:19:48] Runa-tun, read it ton of times.
[00:19:49] Yeah.
[00:19:50] Me too.
[00:19:51] Yeah.
[00:19:52] Awesome.
[00:19:53] And flying up into F.O.B.1.
[00:19:56] Right with the Kingby.
[00:19:57] Yeah.
[00:19:58] How was that?
[00:19:59] Oh, God.
[00:20:00] It was just another day of the secret war, you know, because they had the old H.34s.
[00:20:06] And so the pilots stood up high and then you had the the apartment in the back for the passengers.
[00:20:11] And there's a door gunner.
[00:20:13] So when McIntyre and me and John Hutchins get on the H.34s, the door is only on the right
[00:20:20] side.
[00:20:21] So we all get in and I see the helicopter pilot gunner gunner gunner gunner gunner gunner.
[00:20:27] Was the gunner Vietnamese?
[00:20:28] Yeah.
[00:20:29] This is all Vietnamese.
[00:20:30] Were you ready for that mentally?
[00:20:32] Not at all.
[00:20:33] Okay.
[00:20:34] I guess like yeah.
[00:20:35] Because it's one more novelty.
[00:20:36] Important note to make everyone so the aircraft is being flown by a Vietnamese pilot with
[00:20:41] a Vietnamese copilot and a Vietnamese gunner.
[00:20:43] Yeah.
[00:20:44] It was the 2019 Special Operations Squadron for the South Vietnamese Air Force.
[00:20:50] And all pilots.
[00:20:51] And so, you know, our training was we're going to work with the people there at the
[00:20:58] end of business people.
[00:20:59] But when you literally climb it to their helicopter and your life is now in their hands.
[00:21:05] That's like, you know, we did a big semester.
[00:21:08] I didn't really think about it.
[00:21:09] But it was taking those couple steps, jumping in and going like, WTF2, what's going on here
[00:21:15] now?
[00:21:16] I thought we have, you know, like, you like we've seen in the movie with John.
[00:21:19] They all had you.
[00:21:20] It's not this old age 34.
[00:21:22] Of course, keep thing.
[00:21:23] And that has it in the engine and that was a B-17 rotary engine.
[00:21:27] And we're going to get into the fact of how those guys prove themselves over and over
[00:21:33] over again to be just incredibly brave and not just incredibly good pilots.
[00:21:38] But just brave beyond comprehension.
[00:21:41] Would you find up there was it was it a mellow flight up there?
[00:21:45] It was cool.
[00:21:46] Yeah, it was a beautiful day.
[00:21:47] You know, it's warm like it.
[00:21:52] It's always hot.
[00:21:53] But once you get there, you get to flow you to how it is when you're flying through.
[00:21:52] And we go on over to Cemetery, isn't everything.
[00:21:54] And we're going down Highway 1, which is heading north from Danang up to Fubai.
[00:22:00] And we went past the Fubai airport.
[00:22:03] And so we're flying north on the west side of the Highway 1.
[00:22:06] And you see the airport and then this is big compound, which was the second Armin Division
[00:22:11] training camp company.
[00:22:13] And then all of a sudden it's like your flying north and then on your side, looking straight
[00:22:19] down at the rear, you did a 90 degree flip as it begins to turn.
[00:22:24] So I've seen the guy talking, the door gun are like doing a scrunchy thing.
[00:22:28] You know, we all had our new faties and you could just tell where newbies, disgusting
[00:22:33] newbies, green ass green gray.
[00:22:35] I mean, this guy's going to have his kick.
[00:22:37] So I was kind of thinking, what's up?
[00:22:38] It's going to happen.
[00:22:39] What is this?
[00:22:40] Well, Mac and Target was cheap.
[00:22:42] And Hutchins goes the same way.
[00:22:45] And I'll watch the guy.
[00:22:48] So we did the, you know, you looked down.
[00:22:50] There's the road.
[00:22:51] And it's the first time we had a helicopter with that kind of a radical ride.
[00:22:55] And so he did a 180.
[00:22:57] And then came back and did a 360 and landed.
[00:23:00] We get off.
[00:23:01] Well, we get off and then a reconteen gets on.
[00:23:04] Disappears.
[00:23:06] Was that was that spite team?
[00:23:08] I'd hope that got on.
[00:23:09] Correct.
[00:23:10] So that happens the one zero as to bracelet right there.
[00:23:14] And that does that you got off that bird that brought you into F.O.B.1.
[00:23:18] And it was spite team Idaho that got on board.
[00:23:22] Yep.
[00:23:23] Then it was the one zero and Robert O'Nn was the one one with four
[00:23:27] and distance troops for five and distance troops.
[00:23:30] And so you start your check in and whatever.
[00:23:33] And then whatever.
[00:23:34] How many hours goes by?
[00:23:35] Yeah.
[00:23:36] And all of a sudden, what's happening on camp when you start to realize
[00:23:39] that something's going sideways?
[00:23:40] Well, you know, it's very fortunate when we'll be training group.
[00:23:42] I was a catcher and played center field for eight company softball team.
[00:23:47] And we went on to feed it that summer.
[00:23:48] And the reason why is spite or parks?
[00:23:50] Robert J. Spite or parks was our pitcher.
[00:23:53] Not a little skinny as testing could bring.
[00:23:56] And we still played fast piz.
[00:23:57] None of this went be slow piz.
[00:24:00] And so we won our games.
[00:24:01] And so I come in, we land McTar and I and Hutchins.
[00:24:05] And we're like literally walking in front of the S3 office.
[00:24:08] Just you had a long road that went from highway one east into the compound.
[00:24:14] The training centers on the right.
[00:24:16] It's all new.
[00:24:17] We hear the Vietnamese and we hear a Cambodians on the left.
[00:24:20] If you go down and we get in and take our stuff out.
[00:24:23] We're just standing, looking stupid.
[00:24:25] And then here comes spite or parks.
[00:24:27] And it's like whoa, I might glad to see you.
[00:24:30] Could we use it?
[00:24:30] We were both in a company together.
[00:24:32] Spent many months there training up before we came.
[00:24:35] And now he, but he was no one that told you what was going on with.
[00:24:38] No, because right at that point it was like, hey, and I got a spare bunk.
[00:24:42] If he goes in and toss the sergeant majors as I notice, I'll, I'm going to bring him
[00:24:46] with me for a couple of days and we'll see what's going to happen.
[00:24:49] Because at that point, Spite or had been on Idaho run four or five missions with the sergeant
[00:24:54] lane.
[00:24:56] And then Lane said you're ready for your own team.
[00:24:58] So he promotes them off.
[00:24:59] They appointed him as a one zero.
[00:25:02] And so he was in that interim time waiting for the transition to come where he's going
[00:25:06] to get assigned to team.
[00:25:08] And so he's in base.
[00:25:11] Team goes out.
[00:25:12] So he's got a high degree of interest on what their status is.
[00:25:16] So they missed the first common check.
[00:25:19] They gave a team okay, which in our case, once you're on the ground, you usually wait
[00:25:22] about 10 minutes to see what's going on around you.
[00:25:26] They gave a team okay.
[00:25:27] Then the assets leave because they can't stay there long anyway.
[00:25:30] At least the helicopters.
[00:25:31] So they head back.
[00:25:32] Which the team okay was breaking Squelch on the radio?
[00:25:36] Right.
[00:25:37] Generally speaking, yeah.
[00:25:39] So for those of you that don't know what that is.
[00:25:41] When you break, we squeeze the handset on the radio.
[00:25:43] You can tell on the other end.
[00:25:45] Okay.
[00:25:46] They just purposely squeeze that microphone three times.
[00:25:49] We know that that's the signal for okay.
[00:25:51] Right.
[00:25:52] And sometimes early on the guys may say, team okay, but yeah, later on, that's all it was.
[00:25:59] It was a break break and then they say, okay, then coffee will leave.
[00:26:04] So they were in and then spider came back later he goes, hey, we haven't heard from
[00:26:08] my to hell.
[00:26:09] So by dinner time, hey, we haven't heard by Hadoho.
[00:26:13] We haven't heard from them.
[00:26:14] We're really concerned about what's going on here.
[00:26:16] And then by the morning, there's still at that point, not a word.
[00:26:22] And what point did you guys get word?
[00:26:25] I know what, I'm hazing on how many what the day or time frame was, but eventually another
[00:26:31] day decided that it's been too long, no combo.
[00:26:34] They put in what they call a bright light, which is a team that goes into either fine
[00:26:38] the other team, if just casualties or downpilest.
[00:26:42] That's what the bright light missions were.
[00:26:44] Downpilest, bring relief or just bring casualties out or help people get the team out
[00:26:50] the wounded team.
[00:26:51] So they went in and a team that went in, everybody was wounded, one guy was killed.
[00:26:56] This is from the team that went in.
[00:26:57] Went in for the bright light.
[00:26:58] This is Oregon.
[00:27:00] Correct.
[00:27:01] Yeah.
[00:27:02] With Mike Tucker and George, the troll stirmer, they went in and at one point, they were thrown
[00:27:09] in a bomb crater.
[00:27:11] And so the NVA, we're hitting them with our weapons, Car 15 fire, they had our M26
[00:27:18] and the flag grenades, one of which blew off George's jungle boot.
[00:27:22] So all these guys were really banged up pretty bad when they came out.
[00:27:26] And they got out.
[00:27:27] And they didn't find anybody from Idaho.
[00:27:29] Correct.
[00:27:30] I'm going to take it back to the book here.
[00:27:35] This is sort of the reaction back at FOB1 when Oregon comes back.
[00:27:45] The kick base, there was a collective sigh of relief that ST Oregon had survived the short
[00:27:49] lift but furious but ferocious bright light mission.
[00:27:52] The loss of ST Idaho, however, hung over the camp like an invisible fog.
[00:27:59] Spider was the first person I spoke to after that bright light.
[00:28:03] He went straight to the bar, unable to believe that ST Idaho had vanished.
[00:28:07] The complete lack of clues added to the mystery, where they killed, where they wounded
[00:28:12] the captured and now prisoners of the NVA, and that entire voice, everyone's next thought.
[00:28:19] Before he'd be captured by the NVA, he said he'd kill himself with a round from his car
[00:28:24] 15 or pretend to be dead and blow up as many NVA as possible with one final hand grenade.
[00:28:30] There was no doubt in my mind.
[00:28:32] I'd never be taken alive.
[00:28:34] From that day forward, I always carried an M26 frag grenade on the upper hook of my web gear.
[00:28:40] It was the last one I'd used.
[00:28:43] I would use.
[00:28:46] Welcome to CNC, McIntyre Muddered.
[00:28:50] We had heard about ST Asp from FOB4 vanishing and loused, presumed KIA on 28 March 1968.
[00:28:59] But there were others.
[00:29:01] Sergeant 1st class Robert L. Taylor killed 4 April.
[00:29:06] ST Bear from FOB3 KIA loused.
[00:29:10] Major George Cuomo, U17 crash died 14 April.
[00:29:16] FOB5 based Spite Team members, Sergeant 1st class Lee Roy and Wright and Staff Sergeant Lloyd F.
[00:29:23] Mussel, KIA Fishook area of Cambodia, 2 May.
[00:29:28] FOB2 based Lieutenant Joseph C. Schrieve, KIA Hatchett 4 Operation 1 May.
[00:29:37] FOB1 based ST Alabama Team members, Specialist 5th class Kenneth M. Cryon and Private
[00:29:45] 1st class Paul Chester King, KIA, A. Schow target 4 May.
[00:29:52] FOB1 Hatchett 4 Sergeant 1st class Ronald J. Miller, KIA 12 May.
[00:29:58] FOB1 based Master Sergeant Robert D. Plato and 1st and Sergeant 1st class John Hartley
[00:30:04] Robertson, KIA King B. Helicopter Krausch, Crash Loused 20 May.
[00:30:10] Additionally, 5 SF troops were killed at FOB3 from mortar and artillery strappinol between
[00:30:17] 15 and 21 April 1968.
[00:30:21] Specialist 5th class Charles M. Corey Specialist 5th class Daniel F. Sandival, Sergeant
[00:30:28] Dennis Thorpe, Sergeant 1st class Stefan Mazak and Specialist 5th class Samuel R. Hughes.
[00:30:38] McIntyre and I didn't personally know any of the KIAs, but the sheer number in that
[00:30:43] short period of time was sobering. Most of them were veteran special forces soldiers.
[00:30:51] King is green as we were made us all the more nervous, but not scared enough to quit CNC.
[00:31:02] That's quite the welcome aboard.
[00:31:07] Well yeah, then one little side note on Spiderman Parks on that bright light. When the team
[00:31:13] came out, there was so shot up because one of the team members got a disney wounded on
[00:31:19] the extraction that they never gave a team okay. Spiderman down with a King B. Separate
[00:31:25] King B. God out looking to make sure everybody was out. And they took a tense fire.
[00:31:32] That King B got fired up and on extraction, the door gunner was KIA on that. So Spiderman
[00:31:39] was quite a mess when he got back.
[00:31:46] Yeah, that was such a short period of time to be losing all those guys. That's a matter
[00:31:50] of months. Oh yeah. And we left the subway out.
[00:31:59] So these Spike teams going in. Were you explained a little bit about what the Spike teams
[00:32:05] were? The Spike teams were the code name for our recontimes. They had two basic elements
[00:32:12] with CNC. The hatch of force which could be a company, a petriner, a company size operation.
[00:32:20] And then the recontimes which we had would be two or three Americans with the corresponding number
[00:32:28] of indigenous troops. So, initially we ran three Americans with three South Vietnamese.
[00:32:33] The South Vietnamese and our team were really good. And then later, they were so good. I just ran
[00:32:39] myself in a one-one with four of the ditch. And we trained up heavily, particularly up to that.
[00:32:48] And then, learn who the best ones were. And we had a couple of the guys that had been like
[00:32:54] hept or an interpreter, SAL, who had been there. They've been running business for two years
[00:33:00] by 68. So they were highly respected. In fact, only about a grace of God, they weren't on the
[00:33:07] team that disappeared because we were able to build around them. You have this other part in the
[00:33:13] book here. This is another sort of welcome to FOB1. During the first few weeks, in FOB1,
[00:33:20] I attended at least three memorial services for fallen SF comrades. Services were held in the
[00:33:25] mess hall. The last one I attended was for Lane and Owens. During the service, the chaplain
[00:33:30] hesitated on Lane's name. This was the last official function honoring Spike Team Adaho's members,
[00:33:37] and the chaplain couldn't remember Lane's name. I didn't care if he had attended to
[00:33:41] dozen memorial services for other branches of the military. That day, I was so angry. I never
[00:33:47] attended another memorial service at FOB1. The services soon stopped anyway because there were
[00:33:53] so many casualties, no official announcement. They just stopped. Yeah, you and I were talking a little
[00:34:07] bit about a Ramadhi when we were in Ramadhi and the one thing that we started doing immediately
[00:34:13] was going to the memorial services of the soldiers and Marines that were getting killed. And that
[00:34:17] was a big wake-up call for everybody. I can tell you, I don't think probably anyone in my task unit
[00:34:25] had ever been to a memorial service overseas for guys that had been killed. I mean, and here
[00:34:34] we were there with their happening every day. You never think about it? No. To your there. No.
[00:34:39] And you guys that were having so many casualties that they just said, okay, well we're not
[00:34:43] going to have them anymore. Here's talking about some of your first few operations that you
[00:34:54] went on. And I don't think I've talked about this, but so these little teams that you had.
[00:35:01] Yeah. These little teams were getting into helicopters and flying over the fence, which means
[00:35:10] over the border into Lous and Cambodia to do reconnaissance pretty much in the middle of nowhere by
[00:35:21] yourselves. Correct. This type of operation in present day is not very likely to happen.
[00:35:29] The amount of risk that you guys were taken, it's it's crazy to read about like my
[00:35:34] my personal contingency that I'm running through my head. You know, what if this happened? What if
[00:35:40] that happens? Right. I'm looking at these saying, yeah, if I was the commander in charge, I'd say,
[00:35:44] well, you need to come up with a better plan. You need to come up with something where we have
[00:35:48] better backup, especially when the situation is because you guys can get air support and you guys
[00:35:52] used it heavily, but as soon as the weather rolled in, it was like, you guys are out there on your own.
[00:35:57] And I mean, we'll get into some stories. We're out there on your own. For sure.
[00:36:02] And you know, and that element of this nextary contingency, we had no artillery,
[00:36:12] no traditional army or marine corps support, and of course no seal teams. They were busy doing
[00:36:18] this stuff on the coast. And so it was quite something, go across the fence. And in a way,
[00:36:26] we were flying into the 18th century because everything was so old, the way of working.
[00:36:34] And they said, do slasher and burn agriculture. So you come in with the helicopter,
[00:36:38] everybody will hear you coming. And the local people had to cooperate with the NVA, because their
[00:36:43] model was work with us. We're going to kill your dumbass. So the game was on. And the purpose of
[00:36:51] most of these was to figure out where the trails were, what was being transported, where the location
[00:36:57] of enemy personnel were. It was basic reconnaissance missions, right? Well, in addition to, yes,
[00:37:03] that was the first part. So you always had general missions. Here's a point mission,
[00:37:08] because by the end of 68, they were building fuel lines from the north. They were coming down.
[00:37:14] They were going across the DMZ river in Laos. And so we heard reports about that. So that could be
[00:37:20] a point mission or general re-conocity where the movement's gone, what supplies are. And then
[00:37:27] wire taps, fuel, W snatch, and those were the other missions. And so our south-view and the
[00:37:34] meters are trained. We trained them up so back then we had stadium art and cassette player, right?
[00:37:41] And south could climb up a telephone pole, hook it up, and then cover to wire all the way up
[00:37:46] with mud. So if anybody walked past, they would never see that wire. And we would record,
[00:37:52] because the CIA told us, if you record, even though you don't hear anything, keep it on.
[00:37:58] Because when you get those tastes back to it, we're going to amplify it a hundred times,
[00:38:01] because the north Vietnamese phones even over in the cradle, they're still on. And we could record it.
[00:38:08] They'd amplify it and they could hear people talking to the background, get in tell off of that.
[00:38:11] So does it some of the other missions? So you start going on your first few operations here.
[00:38:20] And by the next morning, back to the book, by the next morning, the weathered broken and we were
[00:38:23] inserted smack dab in the middle of the biggest road running north to south through the A-show valley.
[00:38:28] Am I saying that right? S-show. S-show valley. There was no jungle. There were however, hundreds of
[00:38:36] bomb creators of various sizes. But what surprised me the most was a number of punji pits that we passed.
[00:38:42] Some were huge, large enough for animals. And you go through this mission, this one of your first
[00:38:48] missions, and there's like no enemy contact. And one of the guys who were walking in and I looked at
[00:38:53] each other and complete disbelief. We had just walked down into the valley, the shadow of death without
[00:38:57] seeing one NVA soldier. Spider-Joke with me saying that, I was one of the few people in the history of
[00:39:02] CNC to have a run, a practice mission, and two missions, and still have not gotten the combat
[00:39:08] infantryman's badge. The award given to soldiers who had seen combat with the enemy or were
[00:39:13] under direct hostile fire. I kept telling myself that this was a fluke, and I remembered what
[00:39:18] the special forces trainers told us at Fort Bragg, the NVA and the Viet Congrillas will fight
[00:39:23] when they want to no sooner. So your first couple of operations, you got pretty, uh, pretty lucky.
[00:39:30] Oh yeah, we're a slayer. Snails not. We went in and put in those Air Force sensors, and then
[00:39:36] we had all this here. Tackier stacked up. Could we just figured it's going to be a shit show?
[00:39:40] Nothing happened. So we left out some poor support and Viet gunner opens up with a 50 caliber.
[00:39:46] They killed him several times, man. Napom bombs. Because they wanted to use sub-domus, big mission.
[00:39:52] Right. Where you uh, the other interesting thing that you talk about in the book, uh,
[00:39:59] I don't think it was one of yours, but even when you guys would do training missions over there,
[00:40:03] that was like a potential for enemy contact on your training missions. Absolutely.
[00:40:06] Yeah, Lynn Black and his team, they ran the heavy contact. In fact, it was the navy that saved
[00:40:11] their dumbass, all that one training mission, because they just happened to have the frequency.
[00:40:15] The king, he's couldn't get in and they called the navy and they came in, I don't know, a big boat.
[00:40:20] Yeah. Yeah. Some kind of big boat. That's really long. But they came in and pulled their ass out.
[00:40:26] Good. They, the Viet Kong must have a couple hundred people who were coming after.
[00:40:30] And they, they were just out trying to do like a shake out patrol with just a little training
[00:40:34] operation. Yeah, just a little in country thing. You know, it's just go train, get a couple of days,
[00:40:38] get out of camp, eat some, eat some lurps, have some fun. Well, you're uh, you're luck didn't hold
[00:40:46] up. Yes. Going back to the book. And is this guy's name Sal, am I saying that right? Perfect. Okay.
[00:40:52] By now, Sal, eyes were, Sal's eyes were bigger than sauces. So you've been inserted and now you,
[00:40:57] you're starting to have a situation unfold. If you raise spider walk and said,
[00:41:02] tell him I'm declaring Prairie Fire Emergency. If he says anything about not hearing any gunshots,
[00:41:07] tell him to fuck off. I'll explain later. Sal's never been wrong. Look at him. As we spoke,
[00:41:13] Sal looked at us. Boku VC, Boku VC, call King B's now. He whispered. And then you get on the horn.
[00:41:22] I have a Prairie Fire Emergency team in distress. I have a Prairie Fire Emergency. Can anyone
[00:41:28] hear me? I spoke in a hushed tone with my hand, cut over the mouth of the radio. I looked at my
[00:41:35] watch. We still had more than a hundred minutes before our next schedule to commo check with spider
[00:41:40] at 1600. No one responded. So the deal with comm windows are back in the day when we had batteries
[00:41:51] that would run out. You couldn't just sit there and monitor the radio all the time. On either side,
[00:41:56] people that were waiting for you to call, they'd be waiting and they wouldn't monitor the whole
[00:42:01] time so they would come up at certain predesignated communication windows. So that's what's going on
[00:42:07] here. You have this bad situation unfolding and you go to call, but they're not particularly listening
[00:42:13] at that moment, which is why no one's responding. Right. You know, I'm just explaining that to
[00:42:17] some folks that is nowadays we have, well, first of all, we have cell phones. We call anyone
[00:42:22] whenever we want it to make some nice ring tone and you talk to everyone there. Even when I got in,
[00:42:26] we had comm windows. Oh, is that right? Yeah, yeah, we set up comms. I was a comm guy too. Sure,
[00:42:31] we set up comm windows and we'll call you, you know, whatever it was every two hours or whatever.
[00:42:35] And that's the situation that's unfolding right here. You guys still hadn't been contacted yet.
[00:42:42] So back to the book, I sat down with my back against the PRC 25 and opened a can of apricots.
[00:42:49] I was facing south and just starting to sip the sweet apricot nectar when all hell broke loose.
[00:42:55] The green jungle around us are rusted with deafening full automatic blasts from NVAA-AK-47s
[00:43:00] and R-KAR-15s because my back was to them. I hadn't seen sales warning gestures or watched him get
[00:43:07] the jump on the approaching NVAA. I remember spilling apricot nectar on the stock of my car 15.
[00:43:13] As I turned to my left with a majority of the NVAA gunfire was coming from foolishly. My first
[00:43:19] thoughts were that I'd have to clean off the nectar off my weapon and not spill the entire
[00:43:24] can of apricot apricots because I had waited so damn long to eat them. They were always a treat in the jungle.
[00:43:33] But the initial seconds of the firefight I remember saw and how do I say his name?
[00:43:37] FEP? What a fuck. Yeah. Fuck. Fuck yelling profanities at the NVAA as they fired on full
[00:43:42] automatic. The crack of AK-47 rounds had never sounded louder or closer. All I could see from our
[00:43:47] perimeter was gun smoke. The red and orange blast coming from the darker than ever green jungle
[00:43:52] and the green AK-47 tracer flying overheads. In an odd sort of way there was an eerie beauty to
[00:43:58] the scene. The thunderous fury of dozens of men blasting away each other on full automatic within
[00:44:04] 10 feet of each other killed all other sounds. The ear drums were numb. A adrenaline slammed into
[00:44:10] our bloodstreams and was now screaming through our systems. It heightened all senses. It extended
[00:44:15] time. For example, a car 15 fires 20 rounds of 556 high velocity ammunition in less than one and a half
[00:44:21] seconds. Yet those first opening moments of combat with the NVAA seemed much longer than a half a second.
[00:44:28] Then the second and a half. Or nearly when firing on full automatic the weapon
[00:44:32] expended rounds quickly and we trained ourselves to try and gauge when that last round in the
[00:44:36] magazine was slamming into the receiver. Some men placed a trace around in the magazine
[00:44:41] as a visual cue. During that firefight it seemed as though I counted the rounds leaving the
[00:44:47] car 15 and knew exactly when the 18th and last round was exiting the weapon. Also during that first
[00:44:53] expane exchange, full quiz slightly behind me to my right and since I was on the ground he was
[00:44:58] firing over my shoulder. That exposed my right ear to almost a full blast from his car 15.
[00:45:04] The explosions were painful but fuck saved my life. I had aimed the car 15 down the hill toward
[00:45:10] the largest number of AK-47 muzzle flashes that I could see to my left what I hadn't seen were
[00:45:15] a handful of NVAA soldiers who broke out of the jungle to the right and had opened fire on us.
[00:45:21] Fuck realized I hadn't seen the NVAA troops coming up the hill so we got to my right and
[00:45:26] blasted them back into the jungle. I was so focused on the first muzzle flashes that I completely
[00:45:32] missed the others. If those NVAA soldiers had advanced a few more feet we would have been history
[00:45:37] and the remainder of the team which was on my left would have been at risk. That time war
[00:45:42] continued when everybody ran out of bullets simultaneously. The only audible, the only sounds
[00:45:48] audible were the metal clicks of cold magazines being slammed into hot machine guns and
[00:45:53] bolts slamming shut to resume the firefight. A key element in any firefight is the race to reload
[00:46:00] after the initial contact. On 7 October 1968, ST Idaho won the race. No one was faster than
[00:46:08] SAU, heep, heep, heep, heep, folk at getting the first magazine out the second one in and returning
[00:46:17] full automatic gunfire on the enemy. Within seconds we had gained fire superiority. The months and
[00:46:22] months of training on the range under the 2-delegive spider and walkin all of the live fire drills,
[00:46:29] all the live fire races to see who finished reloading first, paid off. All other games in life
[00:46:35] were frivolous and irrelevant. In this deadly game, if you missed hitting the target, you died.
[00:46:45] So that was your first big contact, huh? That was it. That's a doozy. It was absolutely.
[00:46:51] And it still sticks with us, you know, never forget it. And fuck, I mean later wrong we're back
[00:46:57] in base. I was complain. I'm glad you didn't realize what had happened. And so talking through
[00:47:03] the interpreter said you'd dump fucker. I just saved your ass. These guys were coming up to
[00:47:09] Hill on you're too stupid to realize it. Oh, so you were mad at him for shooting too close to
[00:47:12] you? Oh yeah, because my ear was just fucked. I couldn't hear for days. It's like so thanks for
[00:47:18] saving my life on complainer. Classic. Oh yeah. You continue on with this a little bit as
[00:47:27] as we gain complete fire superiority. I turned on the URC 10 beeper and started screaming into
[00:47:31] the PRC 25. I have a fucking prairie fire emergency that bitter fear-laced plea was greeted with
[00:47:38] complete silence. Woken was less than subtle. Keep yelling until you get someone. A key factor
[00:47:44] in SDI to host favor that day was the small null that woken is driven us to. The jungle is so thick
[00:47:50] and the null is so small that only a score of NVA could rush at once. They weren't moved. They weren't
[00:47:55] fast moving. Fear inspiring charges that the NVA were known for successfully executing
[00:48:01] either. Here the jungle worked against them but the NVA kept coming. At one point, Wolk and pulled
[00:48:07] me over pointed into the jungle and said, look, they're stacking up dead bodies to get to us.
[00:48:12] Hip showed me. Can you believe it? And they keep coming. Hell, if we kill enough of them,
[00:48:19] the body stack will be as high as we are. Because the jungle area was so dark at first. I couldn't
[00:48:25] tell exactly what I was looking at but Wolk and his right. The NVA were stacking bodies and firing
[00:48:30] it from behind their dead comrades. A lot of NVA soldiers died in those first few minutes of how on earth.
[00:48:39] That's a determined enemy. Oh yeah. And we heard about, you know, it's one thing to hear about
[00:48:45] it basically and the press of force is training how determined the enemy was. And the see it
[00:48:53] firsthand. Dying like that. I mean, Lily just kept coming and we had high ground. You know,
[00:48:59] thank God for high ground thick jungle and the fact that it wasn't a big area where they could
[00:49:05] mass more. You guys didn't bring a, you guys didn't have an automatic weapon with you.
[00:49:10] You guys didn't have an A-Dob like a like a belt fed machine gun. You guys wouldn't carry those?
[00:49:14] No, we had a sick, well, in the case of six-man team. And the team's some of the teams began
[00:49:20] carrying the M60 a little later. And then the R-P-G because they cut the barrel off and it had the
[00:49:29] the magazine, the circular magazine, the holes. I think it's 200, 250 rounds. God. But they
[00:49:36] with something to do. But in our case, because we carried the M79 also, it solved off M79. God,
[00:49:42] gave you a lot of extra firepower. But did you use the full of shut rounds without or just the just the
[00:49:46] H-E. But the first round would be flesh-shat. So if anything was close, that would be the first round
[00:49:52] and then we needed the H-E-E-E rounds. For no A-W, man, that's it. This, when I hear that story right
[00:49:59] there, I would do anything to have an M60 machine gun. Oh yeah, that's your way, shit. Absolutely.
[00:50:06] But just the weight, the rounds and everything else, you know, like a my case, I carried the
[00:50:10] radio, always carried the radio. Yeah. And so between the radio, the battery, and we always had
[00:50:15] 600 plus rounds. We were, I was on my first deployment to Iraq. I was on like one of my first
[00:50:20] controls in a humvise and we were out and we ended up, we hit a little, I don't know what you call
[00:50:31] them, the steel hedgehog, do you know what that is? It's like a little obstacle, right? That Americans
[00:50:35] had put out. Americans had put it out, a steel hedgehog, a little obstacle for those of you don't
[00:50:40] know, it's to prevent cars from going by. Well, we, we made a wrong term somewhere and we went
[00:50:45] down road, we weren't supposed to go to and we hit one of those little steel hedgehogs. We didn't
[00:50:50] know what it was. So we're driving like, it's actually my humvise too and it made it loud noise
[00:50:56] and sparked and I actually thought in my mind, I thought we just got hit with a low order ID,
[00:51:00] like a low order boo, boo, boo, boo, we tripped that didn't fully explode. So we come to a stop
[00:51:06] and we all get out of the vehicles and now we're in the middle of Baghdad and there were just
[00:51:11] surrounded by threats and in our mind we're about to be attacked because we didn't know that we just
[00:51:17] ran over our American thing but we're too stupid. We don't know. We don't know that. So everyone's
[00:51:22] out there, we're all out there with our, with our M4s, our little basically car 15s and you are like
[00:51:29] I felt completely naked. I was saying myself, God, we know what, we need better weapons.
[00:51:34] Now we had 50 cows mounted in the humvise but once we were mobile, I'm thinking we do, why don't
[00:51:39] we have, why don't we have belt fed machine guns? When I got, when we got back that night,
[00:51:44] it wasn't just me that felt like that because that night, all my guys, they went in every humv
[00:51:49] every input belt fed machine guns, we mounted and we staged them. So anytime we got out of
[00:51:53] those vehicles, we were ready to go to war. Oh yeah, yeah. Particularly in the situation like that
[00:51:59] because you can have all the limit to people coming out of these. I have a little nuts. But yeah, that
[00:52:03] naked feeling, yeah, because in a w in a situation like this, that'd be nice. Going back to the
[00:52:09] book, more than an hour, my cries and screams into the radio and the URC 10 beeper went unanswered
[00:52:16] as the NVA mounted more attacks. There was no need for radio secure procedures. Now the
[00:52:22] hide and seek portion of the game was over. Now it was simply a matter of survival. My respect
[00:52:26] for the NVA's to nasty grew that day, but the hill, the jungle in our car 15s, worked against
[00:52:32] them as they continued to pile up or drag away more bodies. With no help around,
[00:52:37] conserving ammo while keeping the enemy back became a top priority. There were no more full
[00:52:42] automatic blasts from us, although we had been in contact less than two hours. It felt like we've
[00:52:46] been fighting for several. As the team anxiously awaited for help from above, the few team members
[00:52:54] pitted against the enemy NVA seemed ludicrous in terms of survival. The enormity of the jungle hit home.
[00:53:02] Yes, so you got, how many rounds did you say you would bring? Well, he always carried 600 plus.
[00:53:07] Per man. Oh, no, the Vietnamese were carried a light of load because they could
[00:53:11] just be only like 98 pounds. So I forget what they're load. And you guys had 20 round magazines at this
[00:53:18] point, right? Correct. Now, 30 were just a dream we thought about. And a couple of guys were smart enough
[00:53:24] to write the call order and they had a mail to them later. We weren't that smart. So we had the
[00:53:30] 20 rounds, but because of the spring you only put 18. Yeah. And so you're taking at some point,
[00:53:36] probably how long into this are you starting to take point shots instead of, oh yeah,
[00:53:41] he's just waiting till things come out. You see it and then just one, two. Finally, I heard the
[00:53:49] Texas draw of Spiderman on the radio and have four phantom jet returning from a bombing run in northern
[00:53:54] louss and heard the beeper and called him. I told Spiderman we had a Perry Fryer, Perry Fryer
[00:53:59] emergency. Spiderman said that he had also called the judge and the executioner. Who are the
[00:54:04] judge and the executioner? They were pilots for the 176th of America out division and they
[00:54:11] were the muskets. And they had been assigned permanently to CNC earlier in the year,
[00:54:19] they built the camp duck and then they had been assigned, when camp duck was closed down,
[00:54:26] they came to food by. And they actually built a barracks that the helicopter possibly stay and
[00:54:30] they were one of the crews, them and the Marine Corps, a scarfase, were a gunster that
[00:54:36] regularly hung out with us and saved our bacon. So the judge, they had these old guns,
[00:54:44] they could barely get off the ground. But he had the rockapods and then the executioner was a
[00:54:50] cook and he had the minigun. Those are some awesome call signs. Oh yeah. Going back to the book,
[00:54:59] thankfully we had made mirror contact with Spiderman earlier and he was able to pinpoint our location
[00:55:03] in a matter of minutes. Soon Spiderman was over us. He told me to pop smoke. Our SOP was not to say
[00:55:08] what color smoke grenade we would use. Soon the NVA were monitoring our FM frequency. I popped a yellow
[00:55:14] smoke. He said he saw two yellows which meant the NVA were monitoring our frequency and it guessed
[00:55:19] which color we would use. We changed frequencies and I popped a violet smoke. A few minutes later,
[00:55:25] the first A1E Skyrader arrived on target and made a gun run on our eastern perimeter. His wing
[00:55:32] man made the first Napomron on the south side. Put your heads down. I'm going to make you sweat. He said
[00:55:38] he brought it so close. We could feel the heat from the deadly jelly. A few seconds later,
[00:55:43] we smelled burning flesh. He dive toward us a third time. The pilot drawred its crispy critter time.
[00:55:50] The Napomron was so close we could feel the air being sucked away from us by the exploding material.
[00:55:57] If the jelly landed on a person's skin it would continue to burn. Either until it burned itself
[00:56:01] out or is deprived of air by mud or some other substance. The spads arrival changed the temple
[00:56:06] the firefight when the NVA heard the old World War II plane making another run they charged us in
[00:56:12] a desperate attempt to get as close as they could in order to avoid the skyraders deadly ordinance.
[00:56:17] The NVA were getting close to the belt. That's horrifying. So those that don't understand the
[00:56:23] tactics of that situation. You got aircraft overhead. They're dropping Napom. So what do you
[00:56:27] think? Oh, cool. That'll make the NVA run away. No. No. Actually what they wanted to get close enough
[00:56:32] to Americans that they can't get Napom dropped on them. By 68 they had the attack down really
[00:56:39] tight. They knew when they aircraft were there that they were safe for the closer to us and then
[00:56:44] so they get closer or hopefully the wipe us out and to say their own ass. That's like there's
[00:56:50] I guess there's no higher motivation than that Napom coming out of you if you stay where you're out.
[00:56:55] Nasty. And so therefore even that that stage of the game we had to go back to full
[00:57:02] automatic couple times because they're charging hard. Oh yeah. What numbers are we talking about?
[00:57:08] Never knew. We just stacked them up so high. We'd never had no time to go do a body count. You know
[00:57:13] that is you're just busy killing. Yeah. I don't want to throw that out. This all non-shall not like
[00:57:18] yeah. I know how that is. No, actually we never stacked up body so high that we lost count.
[00:57:26] Going back to the book then an Air Force pilot and an F4 fan of a Rive Dawn station. Tell
[00:57:30] your people the ordinance will arrive on target before you hear me or the rounds. The pilot said.
[00:57:36] I told the team to put their heads down. The phenomenon of having bullets tearing into a target before
[00:57:41] anyone could hear the aircraft which delivered them was unbelievable. The jungle in front of us
[00:57:46] was shredded by the F4's gun run. Within a midnight or two his wingman dropped to 500 pound bombs.
[00:57:52] The change in aircraft staggered the NVA for a few moments. Right then in there I think the
[00:57:57] Lord for Uncle Sam's Air Force. The judge and the executioner rolled in right behind the fast mover.
[00:58:05] The judge's mini gun was real close to our perimeter. Seconds later the executioner followed
[00:58:10] behind him firing several 2.75 millimeter rockets while his door gunners blasted away with their
[00:58:15] M60 machine guns because we hadn't expended any ordinance to our West. We ran the gun ships
[00:58:21] over the western edge of our perimeter. They drew no enemy fire either. About a half an hour before
[00:58:28] dusk spider told us the king bees were on their way. By that time the judge and the executioner
[00:58:33] had refueled, reloaded and were returning a few minutes in front of them. Everyone in STIdeho
[00:58:39] was dangerously low on ambient ammo, grenades and M79 rounds. So now you got the extract,
[00:58:46] platforms are coming back. The king bees are coming to get you. Before the king bees moved in
[00:58:53] an attempt to pick us up spider had the judge and the executioner made gun runs so close to our
[00:58:57] perimeter that we could hear the expended shell casings from the gun ships and 60 in miniguns falling
[00:59:02] to earth. Through all the excitement I told, walking that spider had spotted an area west of our
[00:59:09] perimeter where the king might be able to settle into some elephant grass for us. Walking in and
[00:59:15] hip passed the word to the team and we started moving toward the area from our location. We couldn't
[00:59:20] see the elephant grass and I had assumed we were locked into double a triple canopy jungle.
[00:59:26] Again the judge and executioner hammered our eastern flank as we moved toward the tentative
[00:59:32] LZ. So I got it. Or if you could explain spiders position a little bit because that's pretty unique
[00:59:41] to Vietnam of how those guys could be up overhead sort of watching and directing.
[00:59:47] Yeah they're we called in cubby the codename was cubby c o v e y but they were four air controllers
[00:59:54] basically and in the CNC mission you have an air force pilot at that time most of the cubby's
[01:00:03] were o 2s, says no 2, they had a push pool double engine but they always would have a prior
[01:00:13] one zero somebody with experience who'd been on a ground who would be with the air force pilot.
[01:00:18] So the pilot would fly then he would turn the radio over so to spider or whoever the cubby rider
[01:00:25] was. So that was a slot so sometimes the guys would be wounded they couldn't go to the field
[01:00:31] but they could fly cubby got it so that when we're on the ground we have a situation
[01:00:35] that we're dealing with then he's able to understand as opposed to talking to an air force pilot
[01:00:41] right who's just used to getting a bomb and drop it somewhere and talk about a contingent
[01:00:48] liability that's been off of a firefight and so that was a spider shop he was the cubby rider
[01:00:55] and then he and Pat Walkers that day were the two cubby riders that came in and they covered
[01:00:59] us until they got us out.
[01:01:02] Oh man, going back to the book, Salon Hipwear covered our frantic desperate drive to the chopper.
[01:01:12] After taking 10 minutes to cover those last 10 yards we reached the hovering king b
[01:01:16] which is about 8 feet above the ground. Fox set up an impromptu security watch on the western
[01:01:23] side of the road or wash. A quick check of my ammunition revealed I was down to one frag grenade,
[01:01:28] one white phosphorous grenade and two magazines of car 15 rounds. If I didn't get extracted that last
[01:01:34] frag grenade would be mine. There was no way in hell I was going to be a POW, especially after all
[01:01:40] the NVA ST Idaho and tack air had killed. If I had to use it I'd take as many NVA with me as I could.
[01:01:48] That's a bold statement. Oh yeah but by that time we knew about POW is what they go on through
[01:02:04] and we had lost a couple of guys and one of them had escaped and they were you know by now we're
[01:02:11] hearing the POW stories. So it's bad enough in country but for our mission. No, what's it going to happen?
[01:02:19] I figured it's just a sit. I'm just trying to take as many as we can. Make it a final contact.
[01:02:28] Now you guys eventually get to where you're loading the the king beast which again these are
[01:02:34] Vietnamese pilots. They're old aircrafts. Probably look like they were held together with
[01:02:43] duct tape. But they always had oil and fluids inside and so it's off you sat in too deep you get the
[01:02:49] fluid on your head. But we liked it better than the youy because they could take more hits
[01:02:58] and they had those old B-17 engines up front the nine rotary heads and they could take more
[01:03:04] hits and it's what we liked them. And this captain thin is I think he said thin.
[01:03:09] Captain thin. At some point during the craziness I looked up at the pilot of the king be captain tin.
[01:03:16] He was above all the madness on the ground to completely calm and collected while his aircraft took
[01:03:21] numerous hits from enemy rounds. What made his demeanor all the more extraordinary was how it
[01:03:26] contrasted with our adrenaline hype, frantic behavior on the ground. We had been fighting for hours.
[01:03:31] We were dirty. We were sweaty and we were exhausted. And their sat captain tin. Cool as a rocky mountain
[01:03:38] breeze. Giving the impression that it was just another milk run. It was as though he said no
[01:03:43] sweat boys I got all day. You just take your time. The students will break out the beverages after
[01:03:48] you've secured your seats. Looking at captain tin for a brief moment generated a mental image I
[01:03:54] carried with me forever. Frankly I never understood how one man could be so steady under so much
[01:03:58] enemy fire and keep the chopper hovering. Can you imagine? It's as day I can't.
[01:04:09] Yeah and you go into a little bit further here. A day or two after the extraction.
[01:04:13] Captain tin and his crew came in to F.O.B. one's green beret lounge. I went in and thanked him
[01:04:18] again and ordered a couple rounds of drink for all the king be pilots and crew members.
[01:04:23] Speaking through an interpreter, Captain tin said the king be he flew to extract
[01:04:27] us from Echo 4 had 48 holes in it from enemy ordinance. Sitting at the bar, Captain tin appeared
[01:04:34] to be just as cool and above the fray of daily life as he had on seven October. Tin said that an
[01:04:41] enemy round had torn a baseball sized hole through one of the rotor blades. I asked him how he
[01:04:46] could hover so long. He told me that when he piloted a helicopter he thought only about flying
[01:04:51] nothing else. No enemy bullets, weather or anything. Only flying. If it's my turn to die, I die.
[01:04:58] That day wasn't my turn to die.
[01:05:04] Amazing man. He's a he's an Arizona today. Really. He's still alive. Yeah. Oh.
[01:05:10] We'll be having him on the podcast. Hopefully you want to come on here. That's awesome.
[01:05:15] Uh, and then you had one of your guys and this is like the other on the spectrum. It's hard to
[01:05:24] maintain one of your guys Davidson had to talk to you when he came up and he said,
[01:05:28] I haven't mentioned that your nickname was tilt yet. Which get that nickname? Pinballs.
[01:05:35] See, when you play a pinball machine, you lose and walk away pissed off. When I lose, I shake the
[01:05:40] shit out of it. Get to see my nickname, Leon. Don't I leave? How did the SF guys know about that?
[01:05:46] How did they learn about it from us? It goes way back. Yeah. It was a kid. We said,
[01:05:50] I didn't even pinballs all the time. Little anger man has been issued. Indeed.
[01:05:58] So Davidson, he comes up tilt. I have to tell you something brother. I don't think I can do this.
[01:06:04] I survived back to brother, but I ain't seen I never seen shit like that before in my life.
[01:06:12] We were really lucky to survive that mission. I don't think I can go on. I hate to desert
[01:06:17] you brother, but I think I want off the team. Now I understood that look on his face from the previous
[01:06:24] day. I told Davidson that I respected his decision and that I appreciate his friendness.
[01:06:30] I thought it took more courage to be honest and camp than to not say anything and go in the field.
[01:06:36] A man unsure in the field could get other team members hurt. He reiterated that he
[01:06:42] performed well under fire in Echo 4. He hadn't run. He hadn't quit and he had demonstrated
[01:06:49] exemplary courage during the entire mission. As we walked and talked, I put my hand on the shoulder.
[01:06:55] James, you and I and walk and did something few men in America will ever do. We survived Echo 4
[01:07:01] and all the NVA could throw at us. There were six of us against hundreds of North Vietnamese
[01:07:07] finest. We will always have a special bond. Something no one can ever take away from us.
[01:07:14] Thanks again for your honesty. I asked him if he wanted me to talk to the sergeant major
[01:07:19] or did he want to do it? Because he had only been in camp a short while, he asked me if I wouldn't
[01:07:24] mind speaking to the sergeant major first. I agreed and asked him what sort of assignment he preferred.
[01:07:31] I don't know brother, I'll need some time to get my head straight. And you have a note in here
[01:07:36] 32 years later, I talked to James Davidson and New Orleans on the telephone. One of the things he said
[01:07:44] was brother I've never been the same since those two days and louss. Oh yeah, and he gave me
[01:07:51] back the captain 10 for a moment. The ethic pulled us out and we landed a food buy. I'd climb
[01:07:59] up the bank and say come on in and get you a drink. He goes, no my family is waiting for me. They're
[01:08:05] holding dinner. No, and even on that extraction that night because it's right at sunset. And so
[01:08:12] when we pulled out, it's one of those beautiful scenes where it's a dark green evergreen of the jungle.
[01:08:20] And all these little sparkling lights that are red with the green traces coming up. If I had
[01:08:25] had been traced it was just a beautiful scene but then you realize hey that's the NVA still trying
[01:08:29] to shoot our dumb ass down. But then we flew, he had a South directly for a few minutes. We had
[01:08:36] the sunset because that sweet sunset and was at that point that South looked at me and gave me that
[01:08:42] look. That's all it was. So we cut the mustard. So you know because when I first got in the camp,
[01:08:51] he looked at me. My came into it but it's better introduced me. He goes, he's too tall.
[01:08:57] His feet are too big and he looks stupid. It took me five months to get on his good side but we
[01:09:04] finally got there in Echo 4. All you had to do is just fend off a few hundred NVA together.
[01:09:10] Yeah, that's all it took. And so Davidson, so this was a volunteer to get into the program and you could
[01:09:16] add any points. Hey Tom, you can put. Oh yeah, absolutely. And no dishonor to it. Always preferred
[01:09:23] because like with Lynn Black in chapter six when they came up against 10,000, one of his Americans
[01:09:29] who was the son of a general who was just there to try and get some medals for himself. Never fired
[01:09:35] one round an anger and prayed during the entire day. What is facing the ground? The Vietnamese
[01:09:40] were ready to kill him. So that's kind of thing that you don't want. No, that's horrible.
[01:09:49] Yeah, these contacts that you're getting in, I just it's hard for me to get my head around.
[01:09:55] You're not to beat out there like a low-mic that with just really limited support, you know.
[01:10:01] Oh yeah, there are days, but we had Uncle Sans Air Force and those door gunners were great.
[01:10:09] Absolutely. And we had Scarface, you know, from the Marine Corps and we had different units
[01:10:12] of attached to us and we're just really lucky. Whenever we called the Aways Came and in fact we won
[01:10:19] Scarface it was Lieutenant Colonel Robinson. He pulled us out several times and he pulls out
[01:10:26] the one time. He got his plexiglass shot out, the bird shot up. We get us back to food. We chewed my
[01:10:32] asses every time we come to get you and he chewed my ass out. We go into the club. He's still chewed my
[01:10:37] ass out. I bought him drinks. Got him so drunk he couldn't walk. He had to fly. He's still chewed my
[01:10:44] ass out. I said Colonel, are you saying you're not going to come to the next time? I didn't say that
[01:10:49] every time you were hanging to Bell they came. But oh my God, they could really, they were
[01:10:54] tried the door gunners we get out of the helicopter. They were like the B or D models was really
[01:10:58] early U. E. So this is true with the muskets. The door gunners had to get out and kind of lift the
[01:11:04] helicopter as they tried to get enough power to get off the ground because they're just so loaded
[01:11:08] with ordinance than they jump in once they got moving. Quite a sight. But they always came.
[01:11:16] And the other thing is that's weird is they didn't really have night time capability. Not like
[01:11:22] anyone. So well it seems like like now it is night is no factor for America. Oh I know we would have
[01:11:30] been over our mother for one of those dogs. Oh yeah, absolutely. Yeah. But for you guys once the
[01:11:36] sun went down it was hard to get picked up. It was hard to call for fire. It seemed that way. Oh yeah.
[01:11:44] No doubt. And then you were racing the sun. You were racing the sun. You were racing the
[01:11:48] nature. Oh yeah, she's a key player between a weather and the sun said. Yeah, that's the other
[01:11:54] scary thing. I don't mean you see, you know this is something I usually say early on but I haven't
[01:11:58] said yet. I'm reading tiny excerpts of this book. So if you're listening to the podcast,
[01:12:05] these are tiny excerpts. This is less than five less than 3% of this book. This book is filled
[01:12:11] with this kind of mayhem. So you have to get the book to appreciate it. Well I'm just kind of
[01:12:16] hitting some of the highlights. But yeah, the fact that you guys were racing against the sun going
[01:12:22] down and how the sun goes down. Okay, cool. Where did we go to that mean? In modern-day
[01:12:27] sealtimes for me, that means we use a night strobe, an infrared strobe that the enemy can't
[01:12:33] see instead of a marking panel. What does it mean for you? It means another another 12 hours out
[01:12:38] in the bush because you're not getting picked up. I just hope that the the lions leave you alone.
[01:12:44] You know, let me to tigers. You had this one idea or you know, the group had an idea of dropping
[01:12:55] like a big giant daisy cutter. But a bit bomb like a 2000 pound bomb in order in areas that were
[01:13:01] so packed with vegetation that you couldn't get in helicopter and they're like, oh, we got
[01:13:07] a night. It will just drop a big bomb and it was going land in there. Yeah. Get dropped off in there.
[01:13:12] And so this one operation where you're doing that, you're heading into the jungle. You're going
[01:13:19] to one of these things where you dropped 2000 pound daisy cutter bomb. You're repelling, you're the
[01:13:24] number one man heading down. Right. And you decide that, like, hey, this is an abort situation.
[01:13:30] I think you saw some enemy. Oh, yeah. And so you decide, okay, let's abort this thing. And here
[01:13:34] we're going to the book. As I looked up, I was glad to see King, who's one of your team members
[01:13:38] climbing back into the King Bay. I got on the radio and told Kovey to abort the mission as we had
[01:13:44] been compromised again for a few fleeting moments I'd consider trying to get the team on the ground.
[01:13:49] Frankly, I was sick and tired of getting shot out of LZs and I wanted to run a mission instead of
[01:13:53] going through the gut wrenching firefight on the LZs, which is, you know, again, I'm skipping around
[01:13:58] this book. But you would do mission after mission where you guys would try and land. You get shot off the
[01:14:03] LZ. Oh, yeah. That would be the primary secondary and then the alternate LCs. So you try three
[01:14:12] insertions. You know, I'm just going to, I'm just going to, for the record, if I go one insertion
[01:14:17] and I get shot off, I'm coming home. I'm coming home. We're going to go on the road. I'm not going
[01:14:24] to go to the secondary. And if I get shot off the secondary, I'm damn sure not going to the
[01:14:28] tertiary. I think I'm going to get away with it. I'm going to go back and come up with a new plan.
[01:14:31] Well, by then, the King be running out on the gas. They had to go back. So you're there.
[01:14:38] Then I saw the helmet of an NVA soldier heading toward the Bomb area. He was approaching from the
[01:14:42] area where I heard the first voice from the jungle area in front of the helicopter, which was
[01:14:47] up the hill from where I was on the ground. As soon as I saw my open fire with my car 15,
[01:14:51] suddenly the King be swirled away leaving me on the ground. Suddenly it was eerily quiet, then it hit
[01:14:57] me. I was standing in the middle of a smoking LZ in the middle of Louss. And I was alone. All of a sudden
[01:15:02] I felt small, very small. The trees that had survived the Bomb blast were tall. The jungles
[01:15:08] around in the LZ was both impressive and formidable and not somewhere I wanted to travel by myself.
[01:15:14] I tried to raise Kavion the radio. There was no answer from Watkins. Even though I was the American
[01:15:19] teen leader on ST Idaho, I insisted on carrying the radio because I wanted to be the person calling
[01:15:24] air strikes around my team. The Vietnamese kept surviving the field and I felt my end of surviving
[01:15:29] the jungle warfare was to direct tax to the air strikes and helicopter gunships to the enemy.
[01:15:36] So the King be comes back. So you're there. The King be comes back. Captain Tuan.
[01:15:41] Drap drops a rope down to you for you to clip into because it's I guess too tight for it to land
[01:15:47] or it doesn't want to land because it's going to take a bunch of time and energy. So they just
[01:15:50] throw you a rope. Yeah, they can't land because there are too many tree stumps.
[01:15:54] They're easy carding and everything down. And at that time we were just refining the tactic
[01:16:01] of using rope extractions. So for anyone that's listening right now,
[01:16:08] when you're refining tactics, try and do it on training operations. What we did, we trained
[01:16:15] first. We had 150 foot rope, we'll sand back to it and then I had a D ring on the end and be 150
[01:16:22] foot rope and so they had to have a sand back so we'll get through the jungle to get to the ground to you.
[01:16:28] And we had developed other tactics but you had a D ring on your chest. Well, you're going to get to that.
[01:16:32] Yeah, yeah. But so yeah, here we go. I saw no NVA but the weapon that was being fired at the
[01:16:37] unmistakable bark for an AK 47. I fired another M79 round in that direction.
[01:16:43] That round's explosion must have startled Captain Tuan because he jerked the King be upward
[01:16:47] yanking me off the ground before I could slip the D ring on my left shoulder around the rope.
[01:16:52] That shoulder D ring was critical for staying in the Swiss seat. We had heard horror stories about the
[01:16:57] body, desecrations and the NVA had performed on Sogman and I didn't want that happening to me.
[01:17:04] As Tuan lifted me into the air, I opened fire with my car 15 on what appeared to be a muzzle flash
[01:17:09] coming from the hilltop area. So you're getting hoisted up by the helicopter while you're
[01:17:15] returning fire and slipping out of your D ring. Yeah, then quite get hooked in, because at that
[01:17:20] as we got a little higher up, I was ricocheting off the trees. I was I was a human pinball for a few
[01:17:25] men's here. Tilt. There we go. Then I became scared. So then you decided to become scared. Okay,
[01:17:35] that's fine. I still hadn't hooked my shoulder D ring and someone fired a few green tracers at us.
[01:17:41] Captain Tuan started to pull out of the target area. As he started gaining speed, I ricocheted off
[01:17:45] a few trees before I cleared the jungle. Having sat in the Kingby's copilot seat, I understood
[01:17:49] why he pulled away from the LZ before I'd cleared the trees. If the chopper gets shot down,
[01:17:53] the mission turns into an operational light mirror while potentially injuring or killing the crew
[01:17:58] and the recon team members aboard the ship. I wasn't angry with him hell. He came back for me.
[01:18:03] I would have been stranded down here for at least two more hours before other choppers with ropes
[01:18:08] could have been able to extract me if he hadn't. But being dragged through the trees hurt,
[01:18:13] I was angry myself for not getting the damn D ring hooked before I lifted off the ground. My arms
[01:18:18] were getting very sore. As I went to switch arms, I was struck by some sort of air pocket and
[01:18:23] suddenly I was upside down at 5,000 feet. My only physical length of life was the D ring hooked
[01:18:31] into my rope seat and the 150 foot piece of rope hanging from the helicopter. I twisted my body
[01:18:37] to look up at King again. Thank God he was still hanging out the door. I signal to get the
[01:18:41] chopper to land. As I was giving King signs, I felt the rope slipping down my thighs to my knees.
[01:18:47] At the same time, my web gear was sliding from my hips over my stomach toward my neck. And
[01:18:52] a matter of moments the Swiss seat was at my knees. The only way I stopped it from moving further
[01:18:57] was by spreading my legs. I felt really stupid. After all the training, this was going to be a
[01:19:03] dumb way to die. As the ropes slid across my feet, I knew I was moments away from passing out.
[01:19:09] There was no way I could keep my legs spread just before the end. Several brief scenes from my
[01:19:14] life flashed through my mind. Dolores, my kindergarten sweetheart, why did she move to California?
[01:19:20] I saw my dad's new 1949 Chevrolet milk truck with its dark evergreen paint with the white
[01:19:25] side panels and rich gold leaf letters. My red wagon from childhood high school football games.
[01:19:32] And to add insult to injury, I saw the front page article in my hometown part paper about my death.
[01:19:38] The story was below the fold because stories about local boys dying in nom were now commonplace.
[01:19:44] That angered me because my family would never know where I really died. On the other hand,
[01:19:50] I didn't want them to know how I really died. Just as I started to pass out, I felt the rope
[01:19:56] slip off my feet. My body went limp. I vaguely remember hitting the elephant grass before landing
[01:20:03] hard on my back on the ground. I had fallen only 10 or 20 feet. The elephant grass cushioned the fall.
[01:20:10] I hadn't realized that Captain Twong had the aircraft descending during those last
[01:20:15] frantic moments. Had those legs spread like a New York City hooker?
[01:20:27] Yeah, that's a nightmare. King came out and picked me up and threw me in the
[01:20:34] chopper left on my gear there. So my car 15 and my sawed knife, which now would be a highly treasured item,
[01:20:42] still in Leos. Oh, you lost it a lot. He just pulled the open a web gear and he had to get
[01:20:48] to think off my neck, the rucksack, the web gear. He pulled it off and just picked me up and
[01:20:54] threw me in the helicopter. I was really happy to feel my head bounce off that metal floor. It hurt,
[01:21:00] but it was a happy hurt. Yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah again, if you have to get this book because
[01:21:08] I'm trying to pick some good stories, but these are just the kind of ridiculous
[01:21:15] things that are going on. Just another day in the song. Just another day in the song.
[01:21:19] Getting hung upside down, 5000 feet above enemy territory by a D-ring.
[01:21:28] Another one here. You guys got some bad weather. You're got no support overhead.
[01:21:34] That's another thing people need to understand is, because of where you guys were located,
[01:21:40] at a pretty good distance away from the bases, if there was no aircraft overhead,
[01:21:46] then you wouldn't be able to communicate with anyone because they would use line to site.
[01:21:50] Now, do you guys carry every carry HF radios to try and make long distance? We had VHS for
[01:21:54] our UHF. Yeah, the York 10 was at. But at nights, during the day there was always an airborne
[01:22:02] command aircraft up. So at the daytime was Hillsboro, code at night, it was moombeen. So they
[01:22:10] would check in with us on our frequency. So you would no matter what, you'd have some
[01:22:15] full of cops. Okay, that's good to hear. And so because of the, we knew the NVA
[01:22:20] RDF radial direction finder was really good. They were sharp on that. So when they would
[01:22:26] check in with us again, it would be just a click-click. No discussion. And Fuzzy, you don't know
[01:22:31] the direct radio direction finding. So if you sit there and talk on the radio for a long period
[01:22:36] of time, the enemy can actually capture those transmissions. They're trying to make a useful
[01:22:42] multiple stations and they can tell what direction they're coming from and they can try and
[01:22:45] get where you're at and they can come and get you. So for this particular one, you guys are
[01:22:51] the weather's bad. So you don't have any, you don't have any actual direct support overhead.
[01:22:56] The, the NVA had been just the, what is the one where you got? You try to set up an ambush
[01:23:00] and they told you don't do it. Well, we had the ambush set up. We'd been there. But then they told
[01:23:04] you don't execute the ambush, right? They don't execute it because we were had visions of,
[01:23:08] we get the POW because the nut day, if you, we caressed a live POW. Five day R&R, anywhere in the
[01:23:14] world, $100 bonus. Like, man, we're talking about, we're the plank and plans Hawaii or Australia.
[01:23:22] We hadn't quite decided. And as spider came back over and I gave him the code, we got a POW
[01:23:27] it would be back at the primary LZ and one hour. And that's where he said, don't move. Yeah.
[01:23:32] But you hadn't initiated. You didn't have the POW. No, yeah, you were waiting. Oh, yeah, they're
[01:23:36] walked up and down a trail. Yeah, it was just a matter of time before you were going to, well, we
[01:23:40] spring your ambush. And this is one of those deals where we violate the order rules of recon.
[01:23:44] Not only we go 10 and 10, walk 10 minutes, pause 10 to hear the jungle, let the jungle,
[01:23:51] see how it's gone. Well, this one, because we had so much trouble trying to get in, they had
[01:23:57] slashed in burn areas that were underneath the jungle canopy. I divided the team. We had to
[01:24:02] eight man team this time. But for each side, and I said, we're going to go up this hill until we get
[01:24:08] to an area to a trail or whatever. And we didn't stop. We went really hard. Maybe 20, 30, 40 minutes
[01:24:14] I forget now. We came up to a big trail. We crossed it one at a time. Covered our tracks.
[01:24:21] Got things that up, South put up the wire tap, had a perfect ambush. You know, we had trained
[01:24:27] limb black had developed the the ambush kilzone so that we had clay mors that would go across.
[01:24:37] But in the center there'd be a six foot area that there'd be no strappin' on. But we had,
[01:24:43] he he practiced on himself and see for it. So he finally figured out at the certain length
[01:24:48] what a stick of C4 was. We didn't knock yourself out. He did literally. Yeah. I know this is another
[01:24:53] enter. Oh yeah. So that's our input. But we had a lot set up. So we had C4 to knock out one person,
[01:25:00] clay mors to kill everybody else with sides, parameters, and one in the rear just in case he
[01:25:06] came down to mountain on us. And they're diddy popping up down the trail. We could have had officers,
[01:25:12] they're walking down the trail. Nobody said upset because we had gone so far so fast
[01:25:16] violating all of our rules that the people up to hill didn't know what was going on down the hill.
[01:25:23] And then Spiders says don't move. I was like, that's what things that really ugly.
[01:25:29] And when he, what was the reason why he told you guys no to do it? Because the weather was moving in.
[01:25:33] Oh yeah. They certainly have been on the ground two or three hours. And the weather sucked.
[01:25:38] And he's at 10,000 feet. I can't even see the mountain, let alone C and L's. So he's saying,
[01:25:43] look, we're not going to be able to get you out of there right now. Just don't do what
[01:25:47] we're going to do and and and break contact in a way. Yeah. So you guys are kind of kind of on the run.
[01:25:53] You guys start moving out of there. Right. And so about that time up the hill, we hear the tanks
[01:25:58] and other trucks starting up their engines. And all of a sudden the activity on the trail
[01:26:03] goes from casual to frantic. Now everybody's two with me guys. They all got their AKs.
[01:26:08] What do you think could have been that you were there? Well, they heard us come in.
[01:26:11] And by then we could hear the dogs. They have some dogs that were deaf back on the L.C.
[01:26:17] So they had started looking for us officially. So when you hear dogs, tanks, trucks,
[01:26:22] I mean a bunch of people with AK 47's. Yeah. How do you feel about that?
[01:26:33] The Pucker Factor is mine is zero. It really is. It's like, oh my God.
[01:26:38] And you know that you've got no form of extraction. Correct. The weird thing is I guess and
[01:26:44] having worked in the jungle a little bit, you know, I spent some time in the jungle in South
[01:26:48] America in the Southeast Asia. Like I will say this, the jungle is huge. Right. And you could see
[01:26:54] we're okay. I can get I can make myself scarce at least until you remember they got trackers. Right.
[01:27:00] And they got dogs. Lots of them. So you're in that situation here. Yeah.
[01:27:06] Another Thursday night. But would you get them? We did get the wiretap though.
[01:27:10] South had run their wiretap. I worked for an hour. So once you want you guys had to take the
[01:27:14] tape recorder with you though. Oh yeah, we carried the little, you know, you think about the traditional
[01:27:20] early old cassette recorder. So I had like two or four of the chip of a deep
[01:27:27] bad reason. And then we had the microphone that had little plug in in and then South would run
[01:27:35] up the tree or fly up the telephone pole. In this case, he'd gone up when he came back down and put
[01:27:40] mud on the whole thing. So anybody going by on the trail looked at the pole they wouldn't see
[01:27:45] in. And so we ran it for over an hour. We had run that wiretap and it flipped the cassette over because
[01:27:53] that was steady. Are the times sets. I think that's where you were. You're now stuck down. Now you
[01:28:00] can't even move in pull back all the clay amorous to see for which direction did you had.
[01:28:06] Did you go away from where you inserted or did you go back to where you were. We went, no,
[01:28:11] we went away from it. If I'm facing ELZ, we went to our left. We had to go, we crossed that big
[01:28:19] trail again. But this time we had a cross it in between and it became up and down. The truck
[01:28:24] went past us and so took us a while to get back across the big trail because this trail again,
[01:28:30] this is LALZ. By the way, this is a slightly more T-min trail. The Ho Chi Montreal. Spiders that
[01:28:36] even when he could see the jungle, he couldn't see that road and the road was big enough. You could
[01:28:41] drive tanks down a side by side. It's huge. It would be the equivalent of Highway 78 or 52
[01:28:50] two lanes. So tanks side by side but it's completely covered by the covered by the vegetation.
[01:28:57] So took us a while to get across the road. Then we went to the left and we finally came to a
[01:29:02] little stream bed and went up that stream because now it's dark. But now we hear more dogs.
[01:29:07] The activity on the trail, another couple of trascobines, all those noise we noted looking.
[01:29:13] And eventually you're holding up and you stop. Right. And on the way up that stream, we put out
[01:29:19] pepper. We put out the mace to throw off the dogs. We had our team go up and down. He's a little
[01:29:26] because it's about 10 foot tall bank. We're in this little creek or stream. He had water in it.
[01:29:33] And so we're trying to lose the dogs. We knew they're coming at night. And now it's dark.
[01:29:38] And we continued up that stream for a while. I wanted to get it far away from them as we could.
[01:29:43] Because Salah climbed a tree and said they're coming. He pointed out he told he had
[01:29:47] there are hundreds of them coming with lights. They all had lanterns and the dogs were getting closer.
[01:29:54] So we could chain up that stream for another hour to at night. Doing still going out,
[01:29:58] putting down the mace to me. Fines went up to the bank on the right.
[01:30:02] Set up our RON for the night. Rest overnight. And I'm facing the bank.
[01:30:07] And the other seven guys are around. And so again, we hear the dogs, the people.
[01:30:13] So we're there in the RON for maybe two or three hours. Two guys come up. The stream with a lantern.
[01:30:21] Burning brightly. They go past this. Lenten goes out and they come back as a compact,
[01:30:27] hept, coughs. And then they stopped. And I think that's where you're going next.
[01:30:33] Well, yeah, here it is. One of the NVA and the creek started crawling up the embankment toward me.
[01:30:38] I was still facing the creek. The NVA soldier was good. He only moved when the wind stirred the trees.
[01:30:46] For a moment, my thoughts drifted to summer camp and new hampsure years earlier. When we played
[01:30:51] capture the flag on those clear summer nights, my favorite trick was to use the woods to get his
[01:30:56] close to the flag as possible. Now, my mind was racing a hundred miles per hour and I realized I was
[01:31:02] the flag and he was closing in. He was too close for me to tell anyone on my team. The jungle that
[01:31:10] might seem deadly quiet except of course when the wind stirred. As the NVA soldier crawled closer,
[01:31:16] I remembered thinking that my heart was beating so damn loud that Ho Chi Minh could hear it in
[01:31:22] Hanoi. I flashed back to my childhood when we used to play high and go seek on West Paul Avenue
[01:31:29] and Trent New Jersey. One of my favorite hiding places was behind the hedges and missed him.
[01:31:33] And Mrs. Amigos front yard. I remember worrying that Teddy's a brow ski or John Wayne Austin
[01:31:39] or Worc, Barbara Pointen would find me because they could hear my heart beating so loud.
[01:31:45] I tried to comfort myself by thinking that because I had not been running in recent hours,
[01:31:49] my heart beating shouldn't be too loud. Yet my heart sounded like a kettle drum during Beethoven's
[01:31:53] ninth. No matter the NVA soldier kept moving up the embagament. I was very impressed with this stealth.
[01:32:00] I could barely hear him. Then it happened during one windy moment. I heard movement very close to
[01:32:07] me. It was only a slight sound but a sound nonetheless before the wind stopped the NVA soldier
[01:32:14] touched the soul of my size 10 R Army Issue Jungle Boot. I heard it's like gas was surprised
[01:32:22] from him. At that moment I had a death grip on my car 15. I had it on single shot. A car 15 on
[01:32:28] full automatic sounds much different from the bark of an AK47 on full automatic. If I had to shoot
[01:32:33] it would be single shots. For a millisecond I wondered if my left foot was far enough to the left
[01:32:39] so that when I fired it I wouldn't shoot myself. Time stood still. My pocket factor was minus zero.
[01:32:46] After a few of the longest seconds of my life the wind stirred but there was no movement.
[01:32:51] He remained still. After what seemed like an eternity the wind stirred again and I heard the NVA
[01:32:57] move backward just slightly. He was so cool. I knew he was facing me. I wondered why I couldn't
[01:33:03] hear his heart. The jungle around us remained pitch black. That was my twilight song moment.
[01:33:14] Yeah. That's craziness. You think he decided like this guy's probably got the drop on me
[01:33:26] and I want to live. What do you think he decided? I believe so because there had been any other
[01:33:31] movement at all. Then he would have been on the receiving end of the 556. He made a tactical decision
[01:33:38] to live. Then obviously once you started shooting the gig's up and you would have been people
[01:33:46] on your trail clothes. And had to happen. I thought was if I just did one single shot could the
[01:33:50] muscle flash would light up where he was and then I would just hope it would take no more than
[01:33:55] a second shot to finish them off. So that the jungle they would hear gunshots but they wouldn't
[01:34:01] be quite sure where. Was this and people that haven't spent time out in the woods or out in the
[01:34:07] jungle. It can get completely pitch black in the jungle. Is that what this was? Was this just
[01:34:14] like completely like he's you could barely even could you see his face at all? Nothing.
[01:34:17] He's like new he was there. You sit there and you can feel your hand in front of your nose when
[01:34:21] you shake and move it back and forth. You can feel the breeze from your hand but you can't see it.
[01:34:25] Yeah. So for those of you that haven't been in this it's when you get at night time and then
[01:34:31] it's a cloudy night and then you're in triple canopy jungle. There is no light. You can't see anything.
[01:34:37] And that's what this situation is. Absolutely. Well luckily you you you got out of that and then
[01:34:46] you guys continue on going back to the book by nine o'clock we had located the LZ and secured it
[01:34:51] at the clear area at several feet of grass on it and the ground was at an angle because it was on
[01:34:56] the side of the mountain again we heard dogs. Our tactical scenario stunk. We were in a relatively
[01:35:02] open area on a hillside with minimal cover and the NVA had the high ground. Time seemed to be our worst
[01:35:09] enemy although having limited airs air resources didn't prove our mood. Finally the other team
[01:35:15] was extracted without taking further casualties and spider was overhead taking ground fire
[01:35:20] from the north of the LZ. He told the trustee and reliable Marine Corps UH1B gunships with the radio
[01:35:27] call sign Scarface were seconds away. As we heard the choppers approaching us one of the tow
[01:35:34] poppers that sound suned planted exploded. So you guys were doing that too. You guys said booby traps
[01:35:40] on them on the enemy set claimors on them. Right. Which would really piss them off. Oh yeah.
[01:35:50] Try to ruin their parade. Yeah. We knew the NVA were going to be hopping mad now. That's an
[01:35:56] gentle way of putting it. Spider was able to vector the Scarface gunship to our location quickly.
[01:36:01] There was no time for orientations. We pop smoke and seconds later. The first Scarface chopper
[01:36:05] roared in. The jungle north of us erupted with small arms fire. The second Scarface chopper roared
[01:36:10] in so close to. I could see the facial expressions on the door gunners. He blasted the area north
[01:36:14] of our LZ with his M60 machine gun. Both Scarface both Scarface aircraft took several hits.
[01:36:20] When the sky raiders made their passes they also took hits from small arms fire that sounded like
[01:36:24] AK-47s. During the second gun run, Sal Blue a claim or in the face of an NVA scout. Sal then
[01:36:31] blew a second claim or returned to the LZ reporting more NVA troops right behind him.
[01:36:37] And you guys this is another interesting SOP and we would do this too.
[01:36:40] Carry claimors. I didn't do the I own the rephrase. We would we got trained to do this. You know,
[01:36:46] you know, jungle situation. Right. You guys would make claimors with like five second and 10
[01:36:50] second fuses on him. Boom put him down pull the fuse. Yeah, and run. I never used to one of those.
[01:37:01] I'm very thankful that I did not. Yeah. Yeah. Apparently the combination of
[01:37:09] air assets and our 40 millimeter barrage is slow the NVA troops long enough for the extra action
[01:37:14] ships to come to the LZ. Spiderman told me that the 101st airborne division was going to extract us.
[01:37:19] The Marine Corps gunships would make one more gun run and for the first time ST Idaho
[01:37:24] slicks from the 101st airborne division would follow right behind them and get us close to the LZ
[01:37:29] as possible. We were used to the Kingbees and new most of the pilots on a first name basis. The
[01:37:33] 101st pilots were good too. But because this was our first time with the 101st airborne division
[01:37:38] slicks, I told Sean King that they had to be the first people to approach the ship and that they
[01:37:42] had to alert the young doorgunners that that five of our men were Vietnamese. That's a crazy
[01:37:48] thing to think about. Absolutely. So you got that we had horrible results when they were
[01:37:53] careful. And again, young doorgunners for sure coming to country and if they're not
[01:37:58] briefed properly because our guys dressed their reggly, they're not that they would look like
[01:38:04] NVA but they weren't Americans. And we've had team members that lost Vietnamese that way. Yeah,
[01:38:10] tragically. When Roger Hade was on, he told a story of the same thing. He had Vietnamese scouts
[01:38:17] and they were doing a hammer and anvil operation with a platoon they had to work with before that
[01:38:22] was new in country. And there were some mix-up, it was on the insertion and you know, just some
[01:38:27] mistakes that compounded. And anyways, these guys, the the Anvil portion was waiting and the first
[01:38:33] guys that came out of the tree line were their Vietnamese scouts. Yeah, and they got they got lit up.
[01:38:38] You know, we were in when I was in Ramadi, you know, you see like picture of seals with like
[01:38:48] beards and all that and they're gonna go like, everyone shaved and everyone, we were regular uniforms
[01:38:54] what the army and what the Marine Corps wore. Why? Because that exact reason, you know, you
[01:39:00] swing around a corner and you've got a 19-year-old on a 50-cal and he sees some guy with a beard and
[01:39:06] a gun, there's a chance you're getting shot. Whereas an American, you know, because the geodists would
[01:39:11] have beards, right? And in Ramadi we just didn't, everything we could do to identify ourselves as
[01:39:17] good guys, right? And your geoders could have everything from M-16s for car beans to AKs. You didn't know
[01:39:24] what they'd be carrying it. Yeah, and they also will be new, our guys had AKs or SKSs. Yeah,
[01:39:30] the other thing was they wore paramilitary outfits. Right. So they wore camis, they wore body armor
[01:39:37] sometime, they wore helmets sometimes. So yeah, that's amazing that you guys, and also you had the
[01:39:44] you had the cognizance to say, hey, wait a second, we've never worked with these helicopters before
[01:39:49] get out there and tell them we got some Vietnamese folks coming their way with AK 47s. Yeah,
[01:39:54] they're a piss because when King went down to the first chopper, nobody else followed and I said,
[01:39:59] you make sure you tell them, then you give me the green light, then we'll send some people,
[01:40:03] and then Bubba and I got on the second next track. And there's two of the things on that mission.
[01:40:07] Yeah. King had experimental pump M79, which he carried it, helped five rounds, and we
[01:40:14] we thought we tried once, but he carried it for five days, well, that for whole five days we were on
[01:40:19] the ground. And so at that LZ it worked. And imagine five M79 rounds go off to 40 millimeters.
[01:40:26] Then also one night was the night that the Russians flew over us and did a resupply, and we were
[01:40:33] begging for Moonbeam to show up and get somebody on it, Russian has. But the whole side of
[01:40:38] the mountain that was a weirdest damn thing we ever saw. So that was like a signaling device for
[01:40:42] that was signaling devices that the Vietnamese were using to have the Russians drop the resupply
[01:40:48] and they were doing resupplies to the Vietnamese. What language did you speak? My foreign language is English.
[01:40:57] So they pushed us through and they weighed the language requirement because by 68 they knew we had
[01:41:03] a SF had a strong interpreter core. God it. Like like, he spoke four languages, he had been
[01:41:09] educated in France and he cracked up my English. And he was a smart ass on top of it. A little
[01:41:15] fucker. But he was our little guy. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Awesome. Going back to the book, the
[01:41:24] extraction was slick and quick. When as we pulled out of the automatic, as we pulled out the LZ,
[01:41:30] the slick took several hits. Three of us returned full automatic fire from our car 15s. I threw
[01:41:35] a white phosphorus grenade as the area north of the LZ lit up with dozens of muzzle flashes from
[01:41:41] AK 47s and SKSs. The green traces from the AK 47s appeared as though they were coming between my legs.
[01:41:48] I was told later that as our slick pulled out of the LZ, the escarface gunship laid down a full
[01:41:54] fuselage fuselage of suppressing fire. The lead marine aircraft piloted by Lieutenant Colonel Robinson
[01:42:01] had the plexiglass windshield blown out of the aircraft. In addition, his chopper in the second
[01:42:06] gunship had taken more than a dozen hits. And yeah, that's the, that's the, that's the, that's the,
[01:42:13] yes, but you were saying, yes, he was riding you and riding you. Oh, yeah, the way you tell
[01:42:18] the book. Colonel does this mean the next time we're in trouble. And we call for Scarface. You
[01:42:23] won't respond to the bell. Hell no Robinson responded. I never said that. It just pisses me off with my
[01:42:29] aircraft gets shot up. Parts are hard to come by and I'd rather be flying. Fearless. And you know,
[01:42:41] you continue on here. I went back to my room. So this is after that crazy operation. You
[01:42:44] clearly make it out for the hundredth time that you, you, you dance in death's face. I went
[01:42:51] back to my room and picked up a news magazine with a picture on the front page about the biggest
[01:42:55] latest antiwar protest say side in saying who side were they on? They hadn't seen Charlie,
[01:43:02] like ST Idaho head. They never, they never asked South, hip, and other Vietnamese men on my team,
[01:43:09] what they felt about the war. What a day. S3 refused to pull us out when we were ready for extraction.
[01:43:16] Then S3 questioned my integrity despite the fact that we were only minutes away from fighting NVA
[01:43:21] in close quarters. Battle had not scar face the AE1Es and the hundred first airborne
[01:43:28] slick defended us from the sky. And there are people back in the states protesting this war.
[01:43:33] I shook my head, dropped my rucksack and web gear, picked up a small ammo belt holding several
[01:43:38] magazines of 556 ammo and went to the S3 to get a Jeep. The dentist was only a short drive up the
[01:43:44] road, but I kept my trusty car 15 year by anyway. I went to the dentist, got my tooth pulled
[01:43:49] and drew new rations and PRC 25 batteries. And the reason I read all that is to read this line right here.
[01:43:57] The next day, the next day, ST Idaho got shot out of 5 LZs.
[01:44:03] Yeah, once the morning and once the new afternoon. But at that time when we got inserted on that
[01:44:10] mission error, we had gone on a couple days of the same thing. The morning gets shot out.
[01:44:16] And on one of those missions on the primary LZ, when the king bee was going in,
[01:44:24] sal, saw a wire across the LZ. How does sal even see a wire in the helicopter when we're going in?
[01:44:34] He saw it. He told the door gunner. Fortunately, the via the meest thing was quick and they were able
[01:44:40] to swore of away. And the A1 came in and hit that. There was a 500 pound bomb. They knew we were coming
[01:44:48] and we had been compromised. We never realized how seriously we had been compromised. And that was
[01:44:52] proof. Hard proof. And our guys, so Tara, I switched a lot of the via the meest around.
[01:45:01] So your guys were some of your via the meest were getting burned out. Oh sure. Because you know
[01:45:05] you do that long flight, go out through the LZ, then you go in and get shot out, shot out,
[01:45:11] shot out, fly back, get lunch, get a new target. Sometimes they just say, here's your next target.
[01:45:16] Cubby would know where it would be. Be wouldn't even have any kind of background or anything
[01:45:20] on it. Just they wanted to get a team on the ground. Go back and then we did it again. Bam,
[01:45:24] bam, bam, bam. And sometimes when you and Sarah, you're feeding me, sometimes Sarah, I had enough of
[01:45:32] the school's your main, whose your main, South of the South, South by counterpart. He was the
[01:45:36] assistant team leader. He is the Vietnamese team leader. And who was the other American that would be
[01:45:40] with you? At that point in time was Bubba, John Schur. He came on the team and the Vemba when I
[01:45:46] became to 1-0 at the end of October. And these guys were all freaked out too because you were like
[01:45:51] young. Oh yeah. And what were you? Was your rank at that time? Well by then I've been promoted to
[01:45:58] an E4 because I remember I like the promoted. Yeah. I'm an E-Doo's in camp with the bill for
[01:46:04] E8 or E9 on the recon team. So Spiderman probably got me promoted back to PFCs and now roll up
[01:46:10] your sleeves so people think you're a sergeant. We don't want them knowing you're just a dumb ass PFC.
[01:46:17] Instead of bi October, we were able to, I respect for and then when Jim wanted to
[01:46:25] off the team which we respected and to this day I respected. Never I'll never say a word against them
[01:46:30] on that. Then Bubba came on. So in November that's when Bubba, he was the one one and then
[01:46:38] on that one mission. King came along. I just felt funny about I want to look extra firepower.
[01:46:43] He wanted to try that pump M79. Yeah, why not just go on a mission to test out that there.
[01:46:49] Yeah. We had that they sent us some thermal barric grenades for the M79.
[01:46:57] Really? Yeah. And then they called a week later and said, hey, did you guys get a chance?
[01:47:05] It was actually late. I think late dumped like an entire loadout on one operation.
[01:47:11] And anyway, they call back this, hey did you guys want to? If you can a chance to use those
[01:47:14] thermonic thermonic grenades, you're like, we use them all. Send more. Yeah, that's the feedback.
[01:47:21] Do not wait. Oh, yeah, and also as I speak of that as one of our side missions,
[01:47:28] we always carried out the sun or Italian green, which would be enemy ordinance,
[01:47:34] doctor took splotin or face. So when we were going along a trail like with that big trail,
[01:47:40] we crossed it. We go down and dump a little bit of the ammo. So if anybody was see the ammo,
[01:47:44] they pick it up. And then if we ever came across a cashier, which only happened a few times,
[01:47:50] we would put the bad ammo in their cashier. So they'd use it for siops, then it would blow up in their face.
[01:47:57] Yeah, that was a good siops thing when they, there was another mission where you talk about
[01:48:03] where they killed the Americans, but they let the interview to me, let's go. That was their January 1,
[01:48:08] 69. All right, speaking of holiday season. Here's Christmas day, 1968. You're inserted into like
[01:48:18] some really tall elephant grass. There's NVA around you. Going back to the book,
[01:48:25] due to the elephant grass, both in terms of the noise, we were making how muffled, how it muffled
[01:48:29] our other sounds. We couldn't have exactly how many NVA were moving or if they were even NVA.
[01:48:33] Black said, I smell smoke, either our hand grenades or the NVA have started fires.
[01:48:41] Things are really heating up on the LZ literally. I radioed spider. I told him we were surrounded and
[01:48:47] had fires on two sides of our perimeter. I told him that if the King bees didn't get in here,
[01:48:53] ASAP, ST Idaho would be engaged in fighting fires as well as fire fights.
[01:48:58] What's really making these funny jokes in the middle of these situations? Sometimes you have to
[01:49:07] laugh to keep in cry. They're starting more fires, Bubba said. By now the noise from the fire forces
[01:49:14] to raise our voices when we were talking to each other, the smoke was getting thicker. I began to
[01:49:17] sweat. We threw a few more hand grenades down the hill to force the NVA to keep their heads down.
[01:49:22] The southern fire, so just so everyone understands this is what's actually happening. You're in elephant
[01:49:26] grass, dry elephant grass, and it's burning on multiple sides of your position, which is 12 to 15 feet tall.
[01:49:35] The elephant grass. So your visibility is like five feet, three feet? Yeah, minimal.
[01:49:43] And it's filled with smoke. Yeah. And getting worse over. We wish you a merry Christmas.
[01:49:50] The southern fires intensity grew by the second and continued to move up the slope towards
[01:49:54] us and around to the east. There was fire or fires to the north and northeast, but they weren't
[01:50:00] heading toward ST Idaho with the speed of the southern flames.
[01:50:05] By now the smoke was so thick. I had my green crevat over my face and pulled up over my nose,
[01:50:11] burning embers from the south, kicked up and flew over our small jagged perimeter, dumping ashes,
[01:50:16] sweat, and small burning sparks on the elephant grass and on us. When the hip and twan were
[01:50:22] hats, several of us soaked our hair. Black told me that the NVA weren't far behind the flames.
[01:50:28] Twan had reported seeing images of short distance behind the flames to the south and southeast.
[01:50:33] Captain Twan knew exactly where we were, as he brought the H34 down the canyon toward us.
[01:50:40] Seconds became ours. My vision was clearer than ever, and I was a completely aware of the smoke fire,
[01:50:46] popping sounds and enemy gunfire. I stood on the western edge of the perimeter, waving a
[01:50:52] colored panel skyward trying to catch the pilot's eye. The H34 continued its slow motion descent.
[01:50:58] All I saw was the bottom of the chopper with the front of the struts sticking out to the right
[01:51:03] and left coming down like a giant praying mantis. The rotor wash from the king be began to hit us.
[01:51:09] Finally the choppers know's turned slightly to the left and I could see Captain Twan.
[01:51:13] Seeing his face, seeing him sitting in there so calmly in the pilot's seat, made my
[01:51:18] confident surge. We would survive. You guys get around, get it under control.
[01:51:27] Under control as you can, you start boarding the chopper. Chopper is the last man board of the
[01:51:30] chopper. I signal to the door going to the exit area. As I sat in the door, I sat in the door as
[01:51:35] Huang lifted the king be straight up for several feet before heading south. As we pulled away from
[01:51:39] the null, fire swept up the hill and engulf the area where we had been standing moments earlier.
[01:51:48] Oh yeah. Have you Christmas up pause?
[01:51:56] Captain Twan roared down the canyon. We had chugged only a short while ago. I radioed Spider and
[01:52:02] gave him a team okay. Once again, ST Idaho entered that magical post-mission moment.
[01:52:08] The adrenaline was still flowing. We had survived another target.
[01:52:14] Every breath of air was sweeter. There was no thought of Christmas, mom or holiday presence.
[01:52:23] Our gift was to be alive. That Christmas 1968 would haunt me sporadically for more than 25 years
[01:52:34] after a while. I was able to stop sitting upright, sweating with fear when the nightmares hit.
[01:52:40] It's been almost 10 years since I had that dream. But every Christmas nightmare is or not. I always
[01:52:46] take a moment to think of Captain Twan's courage. No sweat. King bees never rest.
[01:52:53] Yeah. So that's just a crazy situation.
[01:53:05] Oh yeah. Close. And then this is like on Thanksgiving was when we had a mission down south.
[01:53:11] We were a six-man recon team. The Colonel tells us you have to find three missing NVA divisions.
[01:53:18] The first, the third and the seventh. We found them. How did that work out for you?
[01:53:22] It was pretty intensely used. We used more than one of those five second fuses.
[01:53:26] The whole back. Yeah. That's why you need to buy this book and read this book if you want to hear
[01:53:33] about the eight-man spike team versus a division. That day was three. Three divisions.
[01:53:40] For those of you that don't know what I mean, that's 30,000 men roughly.
[01:53:45] Yeah. That's where those five second fuses. Those five second fuses. Just so everybody understands
[01:53:53] what that means. You're trying to escape the enemy. Have a little thing called a clay more mine.
[01:53:58] It's like the size of a book, maybe a little bit bigger.
[01:54:03] It's kind of bunch of ball bearings on one side. 550. 550 ball bearings on one side.
[01:54:08] That spray out when this thing explodes. So they wound people. How many of those things did you
[01:54:17] guys carry? Everybody had one on the team and then the one one or the other two or three.
[01:54:25] So you guys have to see four. Yeah. And so what these guys would do? So you can use them for a
[01:54:31] bunch of different reasons. And one of the things that you guys did a lot with them. And this is again,
[01:54:35] these are things that I was trained in when I was first got to the seal teams. They do. Okay. When you
[01:54:39] set up a, when you're going to sleep at night or you're going to set up a rest overnight position,
[01:54:43] you're going to put out claymores. And that way if you get attacked in the middle of night, boom,
[01:54:47] you can light off the claymores and you can get some fire superiority or at least shock the
[01:54:51] enemy or do some damage to them. So you guys did that all the time. But then you made these little
[01:54:56] five second fuses knowing that if you're running away, you can just put this thing up,
[01:55:02] you know, put it in the ground real quick or put it up against the tree. Well, yeah, you always want to have it
[01:55:06] up against the tree or something to take the back. But back then even when you put it in,
[01:55:10] and you got the last four seconds before it explodes, you're running and you could still,
[01:55:14] you want to make sure that you got a little protest on the black blast. We used to detonate those
[01:55:20] things that are completely unsafe distance behind them. I, like I look back now and I'm thinking
[01:55:27] what we're doing. WTF times. Yeah. Yeah. It's like let, we, we'd play the game. Let's find out.
[01:55:35] Are you relate the limb blocks? Yeah. Yeah. So you started to tell that story a little bit. For those
[01:55:41] that didn't catch the whole story, the story was, Lynn Black was trying to figure out what it would
[01:55:45] take to knock somebody out with C4. So C4 has six feet. Yeah. C4 just explodes. There's no
[01:55:52] shrapnel in it. You can put shrapnel in it, but you don't have to. So it's just, it's just a big
[01:55:56] concussion. So Lynn Black was trying to figure out how much C4 it would take so we can stun a guy
[01:56:03] so we can grab them so we can get a P.O.W so that we can get a five day liberty anywhere in the
[01:56:08] world anywhere and $100 cash. And so he, so the way he, the way he experimented with this
[01:56:16] was by doing it to himself. Yeah. Just standing around at the range and blasting himself with
[01:56:21] heavier heavier weight until he got knocked out. And when he finally succeeded, he, uh, his hearing
[01:56:26] was bad for a few days. Yeah. This air was all. So you know, I was really, I don't know if this,
[01:56:31] in the seal teams, that would have been, we would have used a new guy for that. We would
[01:56:35] use the new guy like, okay, let's see if this works. I'll do, let's win the stun guns, the tasers
[01:56:42] first came in. Right. It wasn't fun to be a new guy because we had to see how those things work, right?
[01:56:46] So we, uh, we used to experiment that. So, um, yeah, that's, that story is just crazy and you,
[01:56:55] and you looking down and seeing the firing, golf, the place that you just got picked out. Oh yeah,
[01:57:00] instantly. Sure, is this like one of those moments in time? It was the same thing like on
[01:57:07] Thanksgiving Day, we got distracted. They were coming out of the jungle running at Port Arms
[01:57:11] and so they would be trying to come down. So being the door gunner would just literally stop them
[01:57:16] and they're trying to like, one of those cartoons you see on the TV with the guys running and
[01:57:20] stops and gets a joke. They would just push them right back in the jungle before they even fell down.
[01:57:25] And that was just, yeah, you just, you don't forget those things. They stick with you.
[01:57:32] The next chapter is called a happy new year. Oh.
[01:57:35] Well, uh, the day after Christmas, the S3 brass asked ST Idaho to run another MA target in
[01:57:45] Louss. I respectfully declined signing fatigue in general, wearing this. I didn't tell the
[01:57:50] brass that I had a funny feeling about the target. I felt apprehensive for some reason.
[01:57:56] Back at FOB 1 around 1200 hours, someone from the commoshack came into the club instead of
[01:58:01] Vietnamese team member from RT Aspsis on the radio talking to Spiderman. That was very bad news.
[01:58:09] Several of the recon team members in FOB 1 headed toward the commoshack before we got there.
[01:58:14] Tony Horell of Veteran Recon Man came around the corner with some more bad news.
[01:58:20] They were hit by sappers. It doesn't look good. It appeared the Americans and been slow to react
[01:58:25] in a matter of seconds. The sappers killed the three SF troops and chose to leave the South
[01:58:30] Vietnamese team members alive. The news about the sappers was a triple dose of bad news. First,
[01:58:38] we had three dead green berets. Second, reports, one zeroes had received for months about NVA
[01:58:46] sappers being a lethal force were now confirmed. Third, by killing only the Americans, the NVA
[01:58:54] pulled off a major psychological coup. By leaving the Vietnamese team members alive,
[01:59:00] their survival would plant seeds of doubt and dissension between SF troops and our little people.
[01:59:15] And then you guys were heading north. The 101st Airborne Division choppers carried the six men's
[01:59:20] south. When the choppers landed on the helicopter pad, Colonel Jack Warren had ordered every man
[01:59:26] in FOB 4 out to the site. He was held in high regard by SF troops because he genuinely cared
[01:59:33] about his men. It had been said that because of his dedication to the SF mission and the men
[01:59:39] of SF, he would never advance beyond the rank of Colonel. He'd remained in SF too long, a career
[01:59:46] decision that the traditional Army hierarchy despised and punished. Asp was from FOB 4, FOB 4,
[01:59:55] which Warren commanded. After the three corpses were unloaded from the helicopter, Warren gave
[02:00:02] a turse, tear-eyed speech to his captive audience. Warren warned everyone that if they were careless
[02:00:09] in the field, death was the result of that carelessness. Then he bent down, opened a body bag,
[02:00:16] and picked up a portion of a body of one of the dead Americans. He was now crying and screaming
[02:00:23] at his men to never be careless in the field. Warren was never the same after that. Neither was C&C.
[02:00:33] What was it that changed from your perspective?
[02:00:41] Well, from early briefings, probably in October, we heard about the N&VA sapper teams. They were
[02:00:50] highly trained, and they were just where a loincloth, carrier weapon, and they were really just
[02:01:02] highly trained in tracking. So when they came to the attack part, they had minimal clothing,
[02:01:08] and they knew what they were looking for. The N&VA at that point had a metal, kill American metal.
[02:01:15] So they killed us, they got their metal and a bonus, and there would be heroes for the rest of
[02:01:19] the lives within the Communist Party. So we heard about them, and it just kicked up everybody's
[02:01:28] concerned about it. And that being New Year's Eve, the team had that the Americans had
[02:01:36] taken a bottle of Scotch with them, so they had a little hit of the Scotch, we don't know how much.
[02:01:41] And that's what Jack Warren had going to extra distance on saying about being careless, we don't know.
[02:01:46] But those sappers were good, and that proved it and it just gave us an arcase.
[02:01:54] No, as you know, if you do your R&M that night, without the dogs, he would do your perimeter,
[02:02:00] and our people always checked to me, and we always had rotated who's sleeping, who wouldn't,
[02:02:06] and we never ever had a problem with that. No matter how tired you are, there'd be somebody
[02:02:11] awake just so something like that happened, somebody'd be there on full automatic ready to respond.
[02:02:18] New level terror. Yeah, and those guys were so, they just traveling super light and super
[02:02:25] select the sappers. Sure. You know, just could move quickly and that's a scarier.
[02:02:31] Yeah, because you know, we knew that the NVA had all our sources set up, besides being compromised
[02:02:37] in headquarters, they also had people that alerted when the choppers left the long site.
[02:02:43] They had border watchers so that when we came in, they would report where we were heading
[02:02:49] to a higher command, and they would try to rally their troops. So we were up against that at all times,
[02:02:55] just a question of who would be there, how many? And a lot of times, just getting on the ground,
[02:03:00] was the first part, but then you hoped to get into the mission, and it was just really a challenge.
[02:03:13] Speaking of a challenge, you were going back to the book, the daily grind of running missions
[02:03:17] across the fence was wearing on me physically and mentally. As 69 dawned, I began a mental
[02:03:23] examination of life in Saga, being in an elite unit within America's finest special operations
[02:03:31] was where I wanted to be. The adrenaline enhanced high of deadly firefights against a relentless
[02:03:38] enemy under extremely lopsided odds was intoxicating. I had never experienced such exileration or sheer
[02:03:47] terror. Yet there was a little voice in the back of my head which spoke of survival. Surviving
[02:03:54] not only of vigorous enemy campaign directed against the Saga members, but merely surviving the
[02:03:59] odds of going home in one piece. My mind also began the mental debate between rising to the new
[02:04:08] challenges inherent in a secret war and returning to a safer assignment. My one-year tour of
[02:04:15] duty was scheduled to end at the end of April. Under the general rules of Saga after running targets
[02:04:22] across the fence for six months, I could request a cushy assignment. I'd already spent seven
[02:04:28] months with the team. I was alive, however thanks to hip, sal, fuck, taunt, and the other man of
[02:04:37] STI-Doh. I couldn't just walk away. That's where you wrap up this book. You go into some cool,
[02:04:53] one more really interesting story and then you also have a very cool thing in there about what
[02:05:00] you guys carried. What we didn't carry. And what you didn't carry. So how much longer? So now it's
[02:05:06] January of 69. You've been there for seven months. How much longer did you stay with the C and C teams?
[02:05:12] I'll stay right there to the end. We closed F will be one in January. They shipped us down to the
[02:05:19] Nang and that's where I picked up with the second book and they needed help down there. So we hit the
[02:05:27] ground, continued to run. Bubba asked the team to take an off the team. So he left, limb black came on.
[02:05:36] So was linen on for my last couple months and at the very end they had a mission up at the
[02:05:42] Mugia Pass which was north of the DMZ River in Leos which was a major channel point.
[02:05:50] And the plan was for us to go in, set up on a mountain top, taking a lot of clay mowers,
[02:05:57] mortars and calling air strikes for two or three days on that just the race held with the NVA there.
[02:06:05] Because they never had a recon team go that far north. And we did an inspection which is that
[02:06:13] inspection prior to that mission which was about April 20, 69. And then we finally went up to the
[02:06:21] launch site and we were up there. I guess maybe about the 24th or 25th I just figured these
[02:06:28] act date now but we went up to the launch site. Got on the chopper as we get ready to launch the chopper's
[02:06:33] take off and they turned around with back. That target had just had two aircraft shot down over it.
[02:06:41] They figured they just shot down a fanton jet and the sky reader. Chopper's going to be easy to knock out
[02:06:47] the sky. So the sideboard to that, I met a beginning two years ago. One of the guys at Rambeacon
[02:06:54] says, remember those pictures you got on the your second book on the ground there I said, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:07:00] He says, what was that mission? Wasn't that something like that's a suicide mission right?
[02:07:05] He says, well, I don't know about suicide. It was going to be high odds but you know,
[02:07:08] we were gone and we had two extra Americans. We had M60s. We got Buku Bullets, Hangrines. We were
[02:07:16] going to give the shot. Guy goes, do you realize they asked me to do that and I told him to
[02:07:22] fuck off? I go, really? I said, you saw his technique picture. You didn't tell me that.
[02:07:28] So I didn't know what your mission was. So here's a top secret operation. The recon guys,
[02:07:34] another recon man had been given that target. I said, hell, now it was too far north and he just
[02:07:40] felt that the it would just be a suicide mission. Once you get in you never get out other than
[02:07:45] a casket or a body bag. But there's no talking between teens much because everything is like,
[02:07:50] you got a mission, you do your mission, they do it errors. So yeah, well, I already gave you a fair
[02:07:57] warning before we started this that we're probably going to have to have you come back on here.
[02:08:02] Because I mean, I got just, I mean, this these books are, there's awesome the detail that you go
[02:08:10] on to and just the experiences you've had, which are just it's a miracle that you're sitting here,
[02:08:17] talking and able to tell us what you went through when, as far as I can tell,
[02:08:23] there's no way in hell you should be sitting here right now. I agree. I mean, there are times when
[02:08:28] in talking to friends or people that've read the book, you know, particularly on page 202
[02:08:33] would the guy touches your boot. I mean, I've talked to people, it's just like it feels surreal even
[02:08:39] today. It's like thank God everybody at home was praying. And the last thing I want to read from
[02:08:48] the book is just this section right here, the dedication, it says this book is dedicated to all
[02:08:54] sog reconnaissance team members, both US special forces and indigenous troops, as well as to every man
[02:09:02] in every air support unit, especially the King B pilots of the 219th South Vietnamese Air Forces
[02:09:08] special operation squadron who worked daily with sog teams on the ground across the fence in America's
[02:09:16] secret war. This book is also for every man in sog and their support units who made the ultimate
[02:09:27] sacrifice. Yeah, because today as we sit here, there are still 1,589 Americans missing
[02:09:36] an action in Southeast Asia from the Vietnam War that includes CIA, SF, Reggur Army,
[02:09:41] and Lea Solone, 50 green berets, are amongst those MIAs, over 140 aviation army Marine Corps
[02:09:52] Air Force, MIA's diet supporting our missions here, just how deadly it was.
[02:09:59] You guys had a over 100% casualty rate. Yeah, several of our guys have multiple purple hearts,
[02:10:05] Bob Howard, received eight, he had been put in for 11, he was a recipient of the metal abonner in
[02:10:12] December 68 for a mission out of costume and yeah, the cashew rate did exceed 100%.
[02:10:20] Yeah, and I couldn't find any numbers on the numbers that were actually killed, but that was a
[02:10:28] massive number percentage wise of guys in sog that were killed. Right. Yeah, the numbers are hard to track
[02:10:37] and I'm working with a gal now who's a real, she's a retired master sergeant from the 101st.
[02:10:43] She's beginning to do some research to try to put that number together because during a war,
[02:10:48] 3.2 men American served in Vietnam. That includes the 500,000 sailors that were off the coast
[02:10:55] and your seals that were going up north and out of that 20,000, approximately 20,000 were
[02:11:02] SF out of the SF, approximately 2,000 went to sag. Out of that depends on which author you talk to,
[02:11:11] there's no hard stats anywhere, it's because SF was not as good as the seals, I keep her records.
[02:11:17] And it'd be between 500 to 700 maybe 800 green braids actually went across the fence with
[02:11:25] recon missions out of the 3.2 million. Those are our numbers. Yeah, amazing. Well, I hope you
[02:11:37] don't mind coming back here. I'll be honored to come back because I've heard some of your stories pal.
[02:11:42] Did you believe my stories are a big joke? I conversed with one of one of the guys that was in
[02:11:48] Romadi with me, guy by the name of Dave Burke, he was a Marine Corps anglico guy on the ground with us.
[02:11:56] We always joke about our experiences. He had a friend, we had him on the podcast who served in
[02:12:04] World War II, Korean Vietnam. Really, he was a purple heart recipient in every war,
[02:12:09] everyone was worse. That's the way I feel standing here talking to you. I'm a
[02:12:16] in a totally different and much lower category of experience, but that's why it's such an honor to
[02:12:21] sit here and talk with you. Well, that's mutual. If you have any other closing thoughts to,
[02:12:25] well, the only thing about this book actually I just want to mention that I could have done it
[02:12:28] without my wife. Awesome. My dear wife Anna, at the time we had 14 ages and one newborn in the house.
[02:12:36] And since you've imagined that turmoil and I'm working that at a fish wrapper up in North County.
[02:12:44] And so between the fish wrapper and the kids, she goes, go right to book.
[02:12:49] Awesome. She's supportive of it. That is one thing real quick. You got home from
[02:12:54] so you got out shortly there after when you got to done with Vietnam. Is that that's when you were
[02:12:57] done right? You got out of the army shortly thereafter? Yeah, I went back to CNC for a second tour
[02:13:03] and then I got the army in April 25. That's what book two is about. Going back. One tour wasn't enough
[02:13:09] at CNC. Well, you know what? If you're honest with you, I came back in, by the time I landed
[02:13:15] in the States, like May 1, May 2, 1969, the anti war movement was going on strong. There was a woodstock,
[02:13:22] our men walked on the moon, but I hated it. We were and I was supposed to go to Fort Bragg with
[02:13:29] the regular SF, but they put us in tenths, best of forces group was us up in Massachusetts.
[02:13:34] And they had five companies, ABCD and E. E was a signal company, which was Rinky Dink. They had
[02:13:42] new lieutenant's butter bars running this thing. And they treated like basically can't find
[02:13:47] us out. And the top and off they had old career sergeants that are all overweight,
[02:13:52] all an embarrassment to the parade they wore. And they came in and put me up with a tune sergeant.
[02:13:57] And I'm in this environment that was not a good chemistry. So I heard that the MPs were coming
[02:14:05] basically and I went out to Pentagon, I had a woman Billy Alexander who hinted our orders.
[02:14:11] And I told what kind of wine and what flowers she liked. So before I went down here, I had her wine,
[02:14:17] her flowers. And Thursday morning I get to the Pentagon at 7 o'clock,
[02:14:22] get her to flowers no wine. Went back to sleep in the park a lot, came back at 4 o'clock,
[02:14:26] she gave me the orders to nom. I cleared on Friday. The MPs came on Monday and I was back in my team
[02:14:31] and we later. 4 o'clock the MPs covered for. And some bar fights brought in destruction. They
[02:14:37] had reports of a 442 which I had at time, a 442W30, which is what, us and also Bill.
[02:14:43] Oh, I was like, oh, that 442. Oh, yeah, I'm sorry. Yeah, yeah. It's 69, which was the coolest
[02:14:50] card that time. Here meet a first. Sure. There reports about that car going through the entrance gate
[02:14:55] on a sideways drift. I'm sorry, when entered the base on the exit gate, that's what it was. The MPs
[02:15:02] weren't happy about that. They couldn't catch me and I was able to hide within our concrete,
[02:15:07] but they were trying to begin to figure things out. But anyways, they were coming. Sounds like
[02:15:12] the next podcast. That's the warm up for the next podcast. We'll, we'll take it for their next time.
[02:15:18] Like a bad dream. I'll be back if you ask. Thank you. No, that's awesome. These books
[02:15:22] across the fence, which one do you think people should write read first? Across the fence is the
[02:15:27] first. That's my book about my getting involved in, et cetera. And the stories of other people,
[02:15:32] which by the way, we have a greenberry medic John Walton who was the son of Sam Walton.
[02:15:38] You heard a story called Walmart. Mm-hmm. Sun. One of the best medics. There was at the time,
[02:15:43] chapter four, where a fellow greenberry is as leg blown off. And the fun of the music I shot four
[02:15:50] times, John brought them all back and Tom Cunningham's alive today and has two children. Thanks,
[02:15:57] DeJohn. That's awesome. These books are available on Amazon. Amazon. Go to Amazon or be able to

[02:16:15] second book. The second book. If then here there are some stories I missed because of deadlines. Right.
[02:16:20] And the first story we have, the RVContimes in our worst target, Oscar 8, and the NBA come up
[02:16:27] and tap them on the children and say, it's your turn for God, duty. Oh, that's pretty close to the
[02:16:32] enemy. All right. We will cover these books in the future. Everyone go buy these books. So you're ready.
[02:16:39] And thank you. Really true honor to have you on. Appreciate it. honor to be here. And thank you.
[02:16:45] There we go. Happy back. Happy turn. Outstanding. Thank you. And with that, Mr. John, a striker,
[02:16:54] Meyer has left the building. And what an honor it was to talk to him. And I can absolutely promise
[02:17:03] we're having that guy back on. And thanks to you, John, for your for your service and your sacrifice
[02:17:12] in this sacrifice is your teammates. It is meant like you that have allowed us to live the way that we live.
[02:17:21] And that is in freedom. So he has left the building and echo, speaking of living,
[02:17:33] living the way we should live. What do you got for us? Well, as we have been doing,
[02:17:40] talking about duty to first duty to martial arts, capability is what it is. That's really what it is.
[02:17:49] You want to generalize like the whole thing into one big nugget, capability. Just improve your capabilities.
[02:17:55] We want to improve our capabilities. Oh, yeah. Sure way to do that. Not just in the martial
[02:18:00] fields, but in life. It's to train some of that duty too. Yeah. I was talking to there's a girl
[02:18:06] named Kara who trains here. You know, I see her every once in a while. I'll see her whatever. And
[02:18:12] she said basically the stuff we were saying, where she was like, I was like, but I only see her sort of
[02:18:19] in the men's class. And I said, hey, have you tried the women's class? They're women's class. Good.
[02:18:24] Developed. And then she was like, not yet. I want to whatever. And I was like, yeah, that's I think a lot of the
[02:18:28] times will offer more benefits depending on who you are as a girl. We'll offer benefits because you
[02:18:36] can get like the moves you can kind of do, you know, on a body that's more similar to yours. So you
[02:18:43] can go through the moves a little bit like more thoroughly I think in a way for lack of a better way
[02:18:47] putting it. She was like, yeah, that's good. That's true. She's like, you know what though? I really
[02:18:51] like, there's a lot of value here in the guys in the men's class. And she said straight for self-defense.
[02:18:56] For sure. And I was like, yeah, she's like, yeah, because like when you get used to guys and
[02:19:01] meanwhile, there's like two guys scrolling like hard though. You look kind of with the rolling and
[02:19:06] they're grunting it right in front of us like sweating and split their split sweat. She's like,
[02:19:12] when you get with it, and we kind of laugh because we she like motions to them. And I'm thinking like,
[02:19:16] yeah, any girl to come in and see that or anyone, even. Anyone, whoever's the paid in that. Yeah,
[02:19:21] I think you're not going to do that. No way, man. I'm not ready for that. All right. Those are not ready for that.
[02:19:25] Oh, yeah. And what if you just all of a sudden, like one day you go to the grocery store and
[02:19:30] go, now you got to deal with that? Man, that's tough. There's a big psychological gap you need to make up.
[02:19:36] Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. She changed your jitz. Yeah, she was like, I'm used to it. And she's not a big girl either.
[02:19:40] She's just like a pretty small girl. She's like, yeah, and she's too nice. You know, nice.
[02:19:44] She's like, yeah, I'm kind of, and I'm really used to that. And I've been training for it,
[02:19:49] like almost a year now. I'm like a big difference. That's that's good that you can come in here
[02:19:54] as often as you do and have that mindset. That's good. That's going to get you places. 100%.
[02:20:00] So we're talking about jitzu. Oh, yeah. And then you need to start talking about the gear that is needed for
[02:20:06] jitzu. Some of it. Yes. Some of the gear that you need for jitzu is a ghee. Yes. If you're going to train ghee,
[02:20:11] jitzu, which we recommend strongly recommend. We also recommend you train no ghee. You train all kinds of
[02:20:19] jitzu. That's what you train. If you need a ghee, what you do, get one for more jim made. Yeah,
[02:20:24] origin. So you go to originmain.com. This is where you can get all these things. Also, jeans,
[02:20:29] American denim. Again, we all know this, but I'm going to say again, it's all made in America.
[02:20:35] All of it. Yeah, every little piece of it. The little seeds that they plant to eventually grow
[02:20:40] cotton to eventually go into the loom to eventually formulate weave. Yes. Formulate both. The
[02:20:48] fabric that gets sewn and stitched into geese jeans, rash guards, all this stuff shorts.
[02:20:56] Best shorts in the world, too. By the way, yeah, factually. Anyway, all of it is in America.
[02:21:01] Done in America. So boom, there's that huge deal. By the way, so yeah, American denim has
[02:21:06] we have some new jeans, good ones. Jogger, you know, sweatpants, sweat, athletic gear,
[02:21:13] boom, originmain, their supplements. Mm-hmm. Big deal. Pretty much all the essential supplements
[02:21:22] that you're going to need as you go through this kind of a hectic path at times, the path is
[02:21:27] hectic. It should be. Yeah, kind of cheesy. That's not the path we want to be on. Yeah, that's the path
[02:21:32] leads down. Yeah, it's going to be easy if it's a downhill situation because all you're going to do
[02:21:37] sit there and slide. Don't take the path down. Yeah. So yes, the supplements are joint warfare
[02:21:43] for your joints. Joint warfare is more for like if you have a get abuse on your joints. You're running
[02:21:48] a lot. You're doing your jitsu, you're twisting a lot. And you're going every day or something like this,
[02:21:53] or you're just lifting every day. You're lifting every day. Oh, yeah. So basically, if you're doing
[02:21:57] physical activity. Yeah, that's kind of like hard. I mean, I guess you could break it down like
[02:22:01] over you're doing some weak physical activity. Then you might not need it, but I think not
[02:22:08] to do so much with Joe or for you made a good point though at the master. Remember because your knee is like kind
[02:22:12] of on the final stages of healing. Yeah. And you were like, I was like, how's your knee or whatever?
[02:22:19] And you're like, uh, what would you say? Oh, it was good, but like, since I've been standing up on it for
[02:22:24] long time. Yeah, yeah, yeah, well kind of like, yeah, that the master. Yes, it actually swelled up again.
[02:22:29] Yes. Surprisingly. So here's the thing. It made me think when I was a bounce race to stand up all the time.
[02:22:35] Like for the whole thing, you're standing at the front door and not the correct. Right. It's
[02:22:39] acting. The path is like it. And the struggle is real. And, but I have dress shoes on. I don't
[02:22:45] have the new balance or the, you know, the deal. It's like dress shoes. So it's like, it was
[02:22:50] a man joint warfare. What a human being. So, you know, varying levels of heart. So get some
[02:22:57] joint warfare for your joints. Get some acrylic oil for your joints. That's general maintenance of
[02:23:01] your joints. Yes. Life support. Yes. And then discipline and discipline go, which is sort of like,
[02:23:09] gives you a little bit of that. Yeah. Little edge mentally shot in a split.
[02:23:19] One be illegal. Negative. If you are going to confront someone in an intellectual battle,
[02:23:28] what is it legal for you to take discipline go? And they don't. Should not be illegal,
[02:23:35] because it's not any legal drug. It's not even drugs. It's actually a good one. It's no, right?
[02:23:40] Yeah. Good. We lifting weights in advantage. We lift or the results from lifting weights in advantage.
[02:23:46] The results from eating salads. That's an advantage. So boom. Same thing. But discipline just tastes
[02:23:52] really good and have that advantage over your enemy. Whoever they may be. Yes. Then we got a,
[02:23:58] we also got moch, which is moch. Let's just, let's just protein. I had a moch shake last night.
[02:24:07] I meet loaf. No potatoes. Meet loaf carrots. Moch shake. That's a good meal right there.
[02:24:14] Chocolate, dark, the darkness and I put peanut butter in it.
[02:24:18] Boom. Literally my late dinner last night. That was 10 days. Yeah. That's the moch.
[02:24:25] And you can give it to your kids too. You can get the water your kid moch for your kids.
[02:24:29] Yeah. So your kids. So your kids instead of turning out to be like an obese, out-of-shape kid
[02:24:35] that you were like trying to, no, don't even put them on that path. Put them on the moch tray.
[02:24:39] Let me ask you this. When you were young. Yes. And you went to whatever.
[02:24:45] I met you school junior high, whatever. Did you bring home lunch?
[02:24:52] Sometimes. Yeah. So not very often. Okay. So do you, as far as you can remember,
[02:24:58] did you, did you have a healthy home lunch? Did you, was your, you know, nothing.
[02:25:02] And we didn't even know what healthy was. Okay. That wasn't even a thing. Yes. So that's
[02:25:06] it. That was just like, what do you like to eat? Peanut. And what, what do you like to eat? And what's
[02:25:10] cheap? Yes. Right. Because we're going to get you when I get new coal cuts. Right. Because there's
[02:25:16] cost money. Guess what doesn't cost money? Well, jam. PB and jam. Right. Peter and jelly. Go to
[02:25:25] all day long on on on white bread. Oh, white bread. That's okay. On white bread. And then you know what?
[02:25:31] You get the little bad, the little party mix of potato chips, fredo, lays, Doritos, which I never
[02:25:42] liked or used. I still don't like Doritos. But then you get some of that. And then like some
[02:25:46] chocolate chips. Some chips, a hole cookies. You know what those are? Yeah. Get the sweet little, little,
[02:25:52] mini, sleeve, a chips, a hole. Yeah. That's a, and so there's nothing nutritional. Right. There's
[02:25:56] the nutritional value of this lunch is zero. You had nothing. Yeah. That's case scenario. I used to
[02:26:01] get the chocolate milk from the, you know, because that cost five cents for a white milk,
[02:26:09] seven cents for a chocolate milk. Oh, the my school school lunch. Yeah. So I used to get that. That would
[02:26:14] probably be what I actually lived off of because everything else was just poising in a wrapper.
[02:26:19] Basically. Yeah. So that is that is that is your question. Well, I mean the reason I was asking
[02:26:24] is because okay, so my family or my mom, more than my dad I guess, but you know, my mom took
[02:26:29] care of the home lunches in the event of us bringing a home lunch. She, she's health conscious.
[02:26:34] She was like a hippie, you know. So we had like the whole week bread. Okay. You know the, the,
[02:26:40] and then what though, how old are you? I will be 42 this year. Yeah. So you're like five years
[02:26:45] younger than me. There's a difference there in terms of what people were even thinking.
[02:26:51] Yeah. Well, keep in mind, everyone wasn't like that. I'm saying my mom was my mom was like a
[02:26:56] hippie. She was different than everyone. And here's my point with that, where when we'd come to
[02:27:01] school and I bring home lunch, we'd get sort of teased. Because it's like, you don't get the cool
[02:27:06] snacks, the cool freedom, what I believe. Chips and cookies in like the cool fun stuff. Oh, no.
[02:27:12] They're not an up in the milk. Negative. No, you got we got the whole wheat sandwich with like
[02:27:17] turkey from a real turkey with sprouted grains. So we're sorry, we're about that sprouted grain. Oh,
[02:27:25] that's nice. And they're like level. Right. So it is. It is. On the last, we got laughed at that.
[02:27:31] My mom and that guy was coming in hard with the sprouted grain bread with a health. Yeah.
[02:27:35] And never was making fun of you. Because it's like cardboard. I don't even know because they don't
[02:27:40] know how tasted it. It's not that it's more of a social thing. Everyone knows that cookies are
[02:27:43] young. Young. Everyone knows that like chips are delicious for snack and all this stuff.
[02:27:48] We didn't have that. We had like the snacks that they knew that weren't that good. Carried.
[02:27:51] Taste and carrots and like carrots are pretty tasty though. I think so now. Yeah. I think it's
[02:27:56] good about carrots. If you're not eating sugar and you eat a carrot taste sweet. Yeah, it is.
[02:28:00] You're like, oh, this is super sweet. Oh, it's good. You can eat too many carrots because
[02:28:04] your body can't that just them fully if you eat too many of them just that way. I've made
[02:28:09] that mistake before. It's pounding bags. It hurts. I do like one of those bags of carrots. Your
[02:28:13] gut is going to tell you. All right. I know what they're issue. Good. No, but where are you going?
[02:28:17] All right. I'm making a good point unless you even talk about carrots a little bit more. I can't
[02:28:22] we can't but unless I'm making a point. So these kids would make fun of us because they got the
[02:28:26] cookies and we had like tomatoes and sprouts in our sandwiches. Yeah. But growing up when you come
[02:28:36] early adulthood adulthood, that health consciousness paid off big time. Huge texture. So to make
[02:28:44] the switch from non health consciousness to health consciousness, it's like it can be a grind.
[02:28:49] That can be harder. Yeah. And it's just made to the path. I mean, came the path and it's already
[02:28:53] instilled as being a young person. So there's that. So, milk. So my daughter comes home from school
[02:28:59] literally yesterday saying they were teasing me because I had carrots. And choose, she wasn't very
[02:29:04] happy about it. That's what she knows. She just started talking fools out. Well, I started to say
[02:29:09] that but she was it was no time for jokes at this point because you didn't like our issues. You're
[02:29:12] not like, you know, I'm choking anyone for teasing for your carrots. But this is what I said.
[02:29:18] One of the things I said, I said, don't worry about them. There's not first of nothing
[02:29:22] funny about carrots. Like it's not, I'm not saying it's like, or it's so serious. I'm just saying,
[02:29:27] what's funny about I don't get it kind of thing. It's just like, yeah, that's kind of true. And I was like,
[02:29:31] and guess what carrots are good for you. Just like your lunch is good for you. And as you grow up,
[02:29:34] you're going to see the result of that. And you're going to see the results of them not eating,
[02:29:38] not healthy food. Yeah. And you're going to see you need to do better than that as a father.
[02:29:43] Why? Because you need a better deal. Yeah. No, she needs to be like, they say, oh, what are you eating?
[02:29:49] Peel you eating some, you eat and some carrots? Yeah. And then she says, what are you eating?
[02:29:53] There are some type two dieted. You're going to diet age 32. Lose her. Get out of my face for
[02:29:59] I put you to sleep. All right. All that, you know, that direction. That's not part of the way
[02:30:04] where you could go right there. No, that's not how I'm having fun. If on his part of life. But I
[02:30:10] saw her wheels turning when she was like, like, yeah, you know, like, I will all see the results,
[02:30:16] you know. And then, you know, then my wife's there and she's like, yeah, look at Dad,
[02:30:19] how big is muscle? All this stuff right. So kind of, why does your wife is kind of like,
[02:30:23] just making stuff up? Unless it worked. But go back to milk or your kid milk. This is what you
[02:30:31] achieved with that. One of the many things is you actually made it like kind of cool to have a
[02:30:37] healthy thing, have a healthy snack. We're going to sway a lot of people with these books and
[02:30:43] this stuff. I mean, I see that. It is happening. It's awesome to see. All right, dude, we got to rock
[02:30:50] it off. Come on. But that was an important story. That was a long, that was 12 minutes. Anyway,

[02:34:12] what he calls enhanced videos. Some people might call them distracting from the message.
[02:34:19] Sure, they might. Some people like them. They have millions of views. Some of your videos that you've
[02:34:26] made. Do you know what? Oh, yeah. I did. A lot of views. Well, like I said or like you said, yeah,
[02:34:32] you can call them distractions on the message, which I actually won't even argue with it. Thank you.
[02:34:39] But some people look at it or see it as enhanced. Oh, that's what you look at there. You put in
[02:34:47] enhances the message. It's kind of like kind of like, you know, when you have a dog and you got to feed
[02:34:51] them the heartworm pills. You know, where the pills, the heartworm pills is good from. It's good.
[02:34:55] That message is good. But sometimes you've got to put it in the food, you know? So like taste good.
[02:35:02] It's like the message gets delivered. So my message is so hard to swallow that you have to put like
[02:35:06] videos around it. Is what I'm hearing music around it? Yes, sometimes. Break at the jealous. Sometimes.
[02:35:11] Yes. Yeah. Hey, so that's the YouTube channel. Check them out. And then we also got psychological
[02:35:16] warfare, which is on iTunes, Google Play, other MP3 platforms. And if you want an alarm clock,
[02:35:23] that's me talking. Then you go to psychological warfare. That's what you get. And you'll see that
[02:35:29] you can use it as a alarm clock or you can use it as an emergency, as an emergency air cover.
[02:35:35] Yes. Fire support. You're like, I'm not sure if I should work out right now. Press play on the
[02:35:41] on the psychological warfare track that's about not working out. And you will get up and you will go to the gym.
[02:35:48] And if you're about to eat some donuts or some chocolate chip cookies, right?
[02:35:54] Sure, chips are only whatever chips are holy. You've been to sleeve a random chips are
[02:35:59] playing around somewhere. You know, use that term for the first time when it was James Neilson.
[02:36:05] What? James Neilson would talk about eating a sleeve or a meal just get after it.
[02:36:13] James Neilson, a world's toughest accountant. A great yes. Blackbelt and Jiu Jitsu for a long time.
[02:36:20] One of the OG American true Jiu Jitsu practitioners teaches on on Saturdays here at Vickory
[02:36:28] MMA in fitness, which by the way is our gym in San Diego, California. Do you have a train,
[02:36:32] so? You know what's funny about that too? Where, you know, he said, oh yeah, the world's tough as a
[02:36:36] accountant, right? Any teachers Jiu Jitsu too. So teach Jiu Jitsu, that's a job. Like that's a career. Like you're a
[02:36:41] Jiu Jitsu instructor. True. But he's like, he's an accountant. But he's just Jiu Jitsu. It's not like an accountant
[02:36:46] is like some, you know, scraping by sort of gay. No, no, no, no, it's like that's a, and there's a few
[02:36:52] people like that. You know why? Because teaching Jiu Jitsu is fun. And it makes you better at Jiu Jitsu. That's just how it is
[02:36:59] man. The nature of the game. That's un psychological warfare. Also you can get it if you want some
[02:37:04] visual representation of the path to keep you there. You can go to flipsidecampus.com, run by my brother
[02:37:12] Dakota Meyer. He makes art with layers. With layers, the layers are free. They're not free. They
[02:37:21] come with the cost of the art. Right, layers included layers included. There you go. Yes. We've designed
[02:37:27] some of the items there. Yeah. You know, let them know. Like hey, this would be kind of cool over here.
[02:37:33] And if you want something just just request to go to on Twitter, I think is the best place. Yeah.
[02:37:38] And that's cool. Flipsidecampus.com if you want to get some cool stuff to hang up in your house.
[02:37:42] So back to psychological warfare. If you use that whole thing as a playlist, psychological warfare,
[02:37:48] even if it doesn't apply to it, you're not eating donuts. Well, a playlist while you work out.
[02:37:52] You're even if you're not eating donuts while you work out, which most of us do not.
[02:37:56] It still, it like it puts you in this mindset of like, you know, working and re-pain results of
[02:38:02] work. Yeah. It goes back to the podcast machete season when they talk about how the power of the
[02:38:08] audio into your ear. Yeah. Yeah. That's what's happening with psychological warfare. Yes. It's going
[02:38:12] right in your ear. You're like, you walk, you get done listening to that. You're not even thinking
[02:38:15] about the fact that you're thinking about the fact, yeah, here I just said, you're not even thinking
[02:38:20] about the fact that you are thinking about the fact that you don't want donuts, that you want to
[02:38:26] get in the gym, that you want to attack your project. Oh yeah. That's what's happening. Yeah. It's
[02:38:31] true. 100% true. Also, while you're living, if you're lifting that home, if we're doing the
[02:38:36] lifting the home, which I do, which you do, which a lot of us do, actually, people hit me up,
[02:38:41] show me their home set up. Awesome. You should have kettlebells in my opinion.
[02:38:46] kettlebells is one of them pretty much the biggest, as far as changes to my workout, the most
[02:38:52] valuable change that I changed my workout. Functionality. Functionality. Like the band buzz
[02:38:59] word. One time I was doing, you know, you got to have introduced you have risk control, you know,
[02:39:03] and varying levels of risk control depending on the position. I was rolling with a guy literally,
[02:39:07] like he's like trying to release my grip from his wrist or whatever, and like he's visibly angry,
[02:39:15] because he couldn't. So I just sort of sat there and just let him like do it, whatever. And I was
[02:39:20] just technique because technically he should be able to get out of that. Sure. But I've been doing
[02:39:25] those kettlebells. So my risk control is a lot, we'll say the effectiveness is a lot higher.
[02:39:32] Unless my original point kettlebells, this is where I get my kettlebells from on it. So you
[02:39:36] go to on it.com slash jackel there. You can get these kettlebells and they're all the cool ones,
[02:39:40] too. By the way, like always say Darth Vader, my most recent one, Stormtrooper kettlebell.
[02:39:47] My second most recent one, and not to mention all the other primal bells and legend bells that
[02:39:52] I have from there. Also, at on it is the electrolyte mineral mix. That's part of my daily
[02:40:00] make mix with jackel's discipline. Like I said, the mineral electrolyte mix, water. Maybe a little
[02:40:11] gatorid if I'm feeling a little feisty. And oh, that's how you take a joint warfare and grow oil.
[02:40:17] Don't don't drink gatorid or grow a little stuff. There we got some books, too. We got
[02:40:23] way in the warrior kid three where there's a will. It's out right now. And for everyone that's
[02:40:27] got that so far, awesome. Appreciate it. Write some reviews. So I know what you think of it. That is cool.
[02:40:35] If you have warrior the warrior kid three where there's a will, that means you should also have
[02:40:41] where the warrior kid one and two. Number two is called Mark's mission. Also, we got Mikey in the
[02:40:46] dragons. Best children's book ever written according to a lot of people. A lot of people.

[02:41:27] little stat. It's got the big stat. Yeah, yeah. Some people tell me that dichotomy of leadership is
