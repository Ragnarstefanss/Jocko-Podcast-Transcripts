[00:00:00] This is Jocco podcast, number 98.
[00:00:04] With echo Charles and me, Jocco willing.
[00:00:07] Good evening, echo.
[00:00:08] Good evening.
[00:00:12] They asked us to take off our headscarves and loosen any buttons to reveal our chests.
[00:00:20] That courtyard became the marketplace where ISIS men came and chose girls they liked.
[00:00:26] Though they first sent all the older women to another place and the women with babies and
[00:00:31] other children to another place.
[00:00:34] We do not know the whereabouts of these women and that includes my mother and my sisters.
[00:00:42] I had my period that night, but no matter how much I told him I have my period he did not
[00:00:47] believe me.
[00:00:49] He ordered me to strip naked in his room.
[00:00:54] When he stuck his finger in my vagina and saw that I was indeed bleeding.
[00:01:00] Only then did he believe.
[00:01:03] But that did not mean he left me alone.
[00:01:08] Instead he put the air conditioner on a really high volume said that I am to sit still in
[00:01:13] my nudity the whole night and he molested me throughout the night.
[00:01:19] By the time morning arrived I was frozen both physically.
[00:01:23] And psychologically nothing mattered after that point.
[00:01:29] I did not know I had not seen the worst of it yet.
[00:01:34] He would put on horrible sexual movies and would do all kinds of things to me.
[00:01:40] They all had long hair and long beards.
[00:01:44] But the worst of all is their smell.
[00:01:47] I have never smelled such awful smell in my life.
[00:01:53] They do not bathe.
[00:01:56] They feel more like beasts than human.
[00:02:01] Only Yazidi women are taken as slaves.
[00:02:06] She a women they burn alive.
[00:02:10] We saw one she a woman burned alive in front of us.
[00:02:16] Christian women they leave on the condition that their family must pay a fee for ISIS for
[00:02:21] being Christian in ISIS tort territories.
[00:02:26] And SUNY women are left alone as long as they follow ISIS orders.
[00:02:32] If they don't they are whipped and tortured.
[00:02:36] Some of them are the wives of our captors.
[00:02:40] Some of the wives were as helpless as we were and some were very mean women who encouraged
[00:02:46] their men to rape us.
[00:02:51] As long as a girl has some breast she is considered a woman and that entitles them to
[00:02:57] rape her.
[00:03:01] Some girls are as young as 10 and 11 years old.
[00:03:08] I have no past and no future at the moment.
[00:03:13] I am stuck in my anger and pain at what ISIS did to my family, my community and myself.
[00:03:22] I have a new behavior that I can't stop, including washing my mouth over and over again.
[00:03:32] There are nights I wake up more than one time to wash my mouth as I remember what they
[00:03:36] did to me and how they forced themselves on me.
[00:03:42] I am a dead person now.
[00:03:46] I have no life.
[00:03:49] I only hope that my mother comes back from capture so my life can resume.
[00:04:05] So those are excerpts from an article that was in the New York Times by Zaynab Salbe
[00:04:14] and the quotes are from Leyla, which is a pseudonym who was a Yazidi woman captured
[00:04:21] by ISIS and obviously kept as a slave and she eventually escaped and gave that interview
[00:04:32] in a camp in Errol, Beal, which is in Northern Iraq which at the time was an Iraqi government
[00:04:38] controlled city.
[00:04:43] And I would say this if you think that evil does not exist in the world, you are wrong.
[00:04:56] It does.
[00:04:58] It's not just individual scattered around.
[00:05:01] These are groups of supposed human beings that are systematically implementing heinous
[00:05:07] and evil acts on totally innocent people.
[00:05:16] And I have obviously talked about evil before on this podcast.
[00:05:24] My years ago during the genocide in Rwanda 50 years ago in Vietnam during the Mi Lai
[00:05:32] massacre 75 years ago in Nazi Germany 80 years ago in Nanking under the Imperial Japanese
[00:05:43] Army.
[00:05:47] And those things are in the past.
[00:05:51] But it is important to remember that evil is still happening now.
[00:05:58] And I know that it is hard for us to see that especially here in America in this unbelievably
[00:06:05] well protected bubble that we live in a bubble that is provided and protected by young and brave
[00:06:14] men and women who volunteer to go out and hold the line.
[00:06:20] But the evil is out there.
[00:06:24] It always is.
[00:06:29] And tonight we have a guest on the podcast that I think has a very clear understanding
[00:06:36] of evil of where it comes from and how it manifests itself in the world.
[00:06:44] He also has an incredible understanding of the good and what we as people can do to live
[00:06:55] our lives better for ourselves, for our families, for our communities and for the world.
[00:07:03] His name is Dr. Jordan B. Peterson.
[00:07:09] And I'm not exactly sure when I heard Dr. Peterson for the first time.
[00:07:17] But as I dug into the content online, what really struck me was that what he was saying.
[00:07:27] And he was an academic, an unbelievably smart, unbelievably well-read person.
[00:07:32] And yet when he said things, they aligned almost perfectly with things that I believe and
[00:07:37] things that I have learned in my life.
[00:07:42] And so here we were these two radically different people from different backgrounds.
[00:07:48] One highly educated college professor, the other a military veteran and a certified knuckle
[00:07:57] dragon and yet our thoughts were very aligned.
[00:08:09] I would hear him tie history and thought around human psychological evolution into the social
[00:08:17] structure and to societal structure and the way he laid out the maps of meaning behind
[00:08:25] the way we think.
[00:08:26] And it was very useful and it's helped me realize that the way I feel in my gut, my instincts
[00:08:37] about people and about the world, they're there for reason.
[00:08:46] It isn't random.
[00:08:47] There is some reason behind the way that I think and the way that we think.
[00:08:55] So Jordan, thank you for coming on the show.
[00:08:59] Very glad to be here.
[00:09:02] That's quite the beginning.
[00:09:05] Yeah, I think like I said, it's very easy for people to lose track of the fact that while
[00:09:11] you're sitting in an air condition space somewhere, thinking about your next Netflix movie
[00:09:16] that you're going to watch, there are people that are in the most horrible and heinous
[00:09:21] situations that are being put on them by other human beings and it doesn't really stop.
[00:09:30] Yeah, well it's a hard thing for people to contemplate.
[00:09:35] I mean there's two elements to life that are hard to contemplate.
[00:09:38] I mean one is that the suffering that's attended on life fundamentally and then the other
[00:09:44] is the malevolence of people and we're not in the modern world.
[00:09:49] We don't really think about those as fundamental realities in some sense because we tend
[00:09:54] to think about material situations as fundamental realities.
[00:09:57] But the metaphysical realities, the ethical realities are more real and it's necessary
[00:10:03] to know that in order orient yourself properly in life.
[00:10:06] I can now I never really took the idea of good, seriously transcendent good, let's say,
[00:10:12] or ultimate good until I convinced myself of the existence of, well, if it wasn't ultimate
[00:10:18] evil, it was sufficiently ultimate for me.
[00:10:21] Because I immersed myself in a study of the Nazi Holocaust and of what happened in Nanking
[00:10:26] and what happened with Unit 731, which is the most horrifying material I've ever read,
[00:10:32] which is really saying something because there's plenty of horrifying material to read
[00:10:37] and what happened in the Soviet Union and what happened in Maoist China, which are, you
[00:10:42] know so few people know about now.
[00:10:46] I guess what I found most striking, especially with regards to what happened in the Soviet
[00:10:51] Union, was well in Germany for that matter, was that there were a number of people who were
[00:10:57] writing about it like Victor Frankel, a psychiatrist who wrote Man Search for Meaning and also
[00:11:02] Alexander Solgenetz and who wrote the Gulagar Capalago, which should be required reading
[00:11:06] for every, I think, for every American citizen, that there was some integral relationship
[00:11:13] between the moral failings of individuals and the catastrophic moral failings of the state,
[00:11:18] and that that was directly causally related.
[00:11:20] Also, social nets and made a great case in, with regards to the analysis of the Marxist
[00:11:26] catastrophes in the Soviet Union that they were tied in tagually, not only to that dogma,
[00:11:33] but also to the willingness of the typical citizen to swallow endless lies and act them out.
[00:11:40] And he included himself in that set of deceitful people, let's say.
[00:11:45] And it really struck me that because those writings are so profound, Victor Frankel's another
[00:11:51] good example, you can't really read that without it really punching you.
[00:11:56] It really struck me that it was possible that there was some direct integral relationship
[00:12:04] between the individual moral choices that people made in their day to day lives and the
[00:12:08] broad scale social movements that happened around them.
[00:12:11] And I think I've come to believe that that's the case.
[00:12:14] And well, certainly the story that you read, the person who was written about the rapist
[00:12:25] was making all sorts of individual choices.
[00:12:28] And you know, he might have been convincing himself that he was on some kind of holy
[00:12:32] mission.
[00:12:33] But I guess that would be in part so that he could stand, look at himself in the mirror
[00:12:38] in the morning without running away screaming.
[00:12:40] If he saw what was really there, so.
[00:12:42] One of the things in Frankel that kind of in in Mansour's for meaning, that definitely
[00:12:54] two points that really hit me hard when I was reading it was one as I didn't understand
[00:12:59] the extent to which the capos, which were the Jewish prisoners that got taken on more
[00:13:03] to help.
[00:13:04] It would get special treatment at number one, I didn't realize the extent to which they
[00:13:09] were in existence.
[00:13:10] I knew that I knew what they were, but I didn't realize that they were as aggressive
[00:13:14] as they were.
[00:13:16] And the other thing that hit me is the paragraph or the lines where he's saying that the
[00:13:23] best of us didn't make it out.
[00:13:26] And that if you were going to live, you had to do things that you wouldn't want to
[00:13:31] maybe do and maybe if you were a better person, maybe you wouldn't do it.
[00:13:38] And to me that was harsh.
[00:13:40] I mean, this was his admitting that that if you wanted to survive as a person in that
[00:13:45] situation, you might have to take someone's piece of bread.
[00:13:50] You might have to move a number on a list to get someone else sent down to the execution
[00:13:57] area a day earlier than you and that happens to postpone your execution long enough that
[00:14:03] you can make another move.
[00:14:05] That's a scary thing.
[00:14:06] You saw the same thing with the social netzans' description of the Gulags because they
[00:14:10] were run in large part by the inmates.
[00:14:13] But I think that that's a really good metaphor for totalitarian states in general, because
[00:14:17] we like to think that a totalitarian state is made up of innocent oppressed individuals
[00:14:22] who are under the thumb of an evil tyrant and that all of the catastrophes are cascading
[00:14:29] from the top down.
[00:14:30] But I don't think that that's true.
[00:14:31] I think that it's more like a holographic structure where the tyranny exists at every
[00:14:36] single level.
[00:14:37] So it exists psychologically and it exists within the family and it exists within the
[00:14:41] mid-level organizations.
[00:14:43] And so, well, you know, an Eastern Germany, for example, one out of every three people
[00:14:48] was a government informer.
[00:14:50] So what that meant is if you had a family of six people that two of them you couldn't
[00:14:54] trust.
[00:14:55] You can't just say that that's a consequence of the top down structure.
[00:15:00] The tyranny is something that exists everywhere simultaneously once it gets a grip.
[00:15:05] And it's easy for people to say things like, well, I was just following orders.
[00:15:09] And, you know, I'm not trying to put myself in a position where I'm claiming that if I
[00:15:15] was in that position, I wouldn't have followed orders in the same way.
[00:15:18] I mean, God only knows till you get there, right?
[00:15:21] That's for sure.
[00:15:22] But what that did to me was focus my attention more and more on the necessity of individual
[00:15:30] responsibility.
[00:15:31] I thought if it was individuals in the final analysis who were responsible for the
[00:15:34] great evils of the 20th century, which I think is a reasonable way of conceptualizing it,
[00:15:40] then it might be individuals who could be responsible for whatever good there might be in
[00:15:45] mankind that could help us avoid those situations in the future.
[00:15:50] And I thought of that as an alternative in some sense to nihilistic disbelief and ideological
[00:15:57] possession.
[00:15:58] Because if your group identity is too tight, then you start acting like they, like a cog
[00:16:05] in a mob, not a very bad thing.
[00:16:08] But then if your group identity disappears completely, well, then you're left alone
[00:16:11] and bereft.
[00:16:12] And so those are bad alternatives, right?
[00:16:14] You're sort of damned if you do and damned if you don't.
[00:16:17] And it was very difficult to understand that there might be a third path between those
[00:16:21] two.
[00:16:22] I couldn't see the existence of anything because people need belief systems in order
[00:16:27] to exist, right?
[00:16:28] To maintain psychological stability and to maintain sociological stability as well.
[00:16:34] But then if the beliefs get too rigid, then they turn into the raging totalitarian mob.
[00:16:39] So maybe you let that go because you don't want to play that game, but then you dissolve
[00:16:43] because you have no identity.
[00:16:45] That's not acceptable either.
[00:16:47] When I first laid that out that clearly, it was really hard on me because I couldn't
[00:16:52] see a third path to that.
[00:16:55] But then I started to realize and this was a consequence of reading the sorts of things
[00:16:59] that we already talked about.
[00:17:00] But also it's starting to understand the underlying structure of mythology and what the heroic
[00:17:06] path meant essentially.
[00:17:08] And that meant adoption of supreme moral responsibility as an individual.
[00:17:13] Now, there's this idea and the New Testament, which is really interesting idea.
[00:17:18] It's one of these bottomless ideas.
[00:17:21] And I mean that literally, you could study it forever and never get to the bottom of it.
[00:17:25] And the idea is that Christ is the person who takes the sins of mankind on himself.
[00:17:31] And there's something redemptive about that.
[00:17:33] And that's actually a really dark idea because what it means, as far as I can tell, what
[00:17:38] it means, at least what it means psychologically is, that when you read these terrible things,
[00:17:43] you have to understand that you're reading about you.
[00:17:46] If you don't understand that you're reading about you, then you don't actually understand
[00:17:50] the stories.
[00:17:51] Because you put yourself in the position where you're automatically the good person who would
[00:17:55] never do anything like that.
[00:17:57] And then these other people are, while they're devils in some sense.
[00:18:01] And it's very easy for people to make that division.
[00:18:04] But it's a horrific realization when you think that that devil that you see outside is the
[00:18:09] same thing that's inside.
[00:18:10] And that you don't know until you're putting a situation like that, what you might do.
[00:18:14] And then it's even worse because if you look at the historical evidence, it was ordinary
[00:18:20] people in some sense that produced the catastrophes of Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union
[00:18:27] and Maoist China.
[00:18:28] I mean, they might not have originated it.
[00:18:31] But they certainly had the option to say no at different steps along the way.
[00:18:37] And they didn't.
[00:18:39] These things do happen one horrible thing at a time.
[00:18:42] There's this great book called Ordinary Men, which describes the descent of a German police
[00:18:48] force from Ordinary bourgeois middle class men, essentially, just Ordinary policemen, who
[00:18:54] actually were raised before the Hitler youth.
[00:18:57] They weren't indoctrinated as young people.
[00:19:01] And they were brought into Poland to sort of mopop after the Germans had walked through.
[00:19:07] And it describes how they descended into the sort of people who would take naked women,
[00:19:11] naked pregnant women out into the middle of fields and shoot them in the back of the
[00:19:15] head.
[00:19:16] And what's horrifying about the book is that the author, Browning, details the stages by which
[00:19:25] this occurred.
[00:19:26] It's all for example, the commander of this unit told the men that they were going to
[00:19:33] have to do terrible things.
[00:19:35] But that they could go home if they wanted to.
[00:19:38] And then you think, well, there's an out.
[00:19:40] But then if you really think about it, you think, well, there are tightly knit quasi-military
[00:19:46] organization.
[00:19:48] And one of the natural thoughts under that circumstance would be, well, I'm not going
[00:19:52] to leave my comrades to do all the dirty work.
[00:19:55] That would just be a matter of cowardice.
[00:19:57] And so you can see that there's an ethical requirement that would keep you there to begin
[00:20:01] with.
[00:20:02] And then they were.
[00:20:03] You're doing what you just said, which is taking the burden of this sinful activity
[00:20:09] on yourself.
[00:20:10] If you let everyone else do it, then you're not acting heroically.
[00:20:12] Well, right.
[00:20:13] And so it was easy for the men to get in trapped into that.
[00:20:17] And then the requirements for their horrific action kept ramping up.
[00:20:22] And like each time they accepted the requirement of doing one horrific thing, the probability
[00:20:27] that they would accept the next requirement increased.
[00:20:30] And what I was also really interesting about that book, ordinary men, is that it's not
[00:20:35] like these men didn't suffer.
[00:20:37] Like they were suffering terribly.
[00:20:38] They were physically ill.
[00:20:39] They were vomiting.
[00:20:40] They were tearing themselves apart psychologically, you know?
[00:20:43] But they didn't quit.
[00:20:45] So that's a great book.
[00:20:48] Because if you want to know how you walk down the, how you, how you can be enticed to
[00:20:53] walk down a terrible path, that's the book to read.
[00:20:56] And it's very frightening because if you read it properly, then, you know, you have
[00:21:00] to read it again, as I said, as if you're one of the people to whom this is happening,
[00:21:05] not the victim, but the oppressor, you know?
[00:21:08] And I mean, you can also read it as the victim, not fair enough.
[00:21:13] But it's ordinary people who participate in these things and not so very, very terrifying
[00:21:17] thought.
[00:21:18] We actually covered that book on this podcast.
[00:21:21] Both of them.
[00:21:22] Yeah.
[00:21:23] Both Victor Franco and ordinary men.
[00:21:27] Yeah.
[00:21:28] Interesting.
[00:21:29] Because as I, as I, you know, I've watched all your stuff read and one of the things
[00:21:34] that I was thinking about is, you know, you talk about where the hero comes from, where
[00:21:38] this idea comes from and how we ended up looking at these types of people as they're good.
[00:21:44] And it happens over ages, and ages, and generations, and generations of saying, oh, that's
[00:21:48] a good quality.
[00:21:49] And that's a good quality.
[00:21:50] And there's these 10 people that are all considered good people.
[00:21:52] And they all have this couple qualities in common.
[00:21:55] So those are good qualities and eventually that becomes elevated to the point where we
[00:21:59] say that's a hero.
[00:22:01] And what I was thinking of, so that's what happens.
[00:22:04] And now we all have this elevated thing to look at and say, that's something we can aspire
[00:22:08] to.
[00:22:09] That's where we want to go.
[00:22:10] That's where we want to be.
[00:22:11] We want to help.
[00:22:12] And we want to support.
[00:22:13] We want to make sacrifices for the tribe.
[00:22:16] How do we end up, or who ends up saying, I see something evil and I'm going to follow
[00:22:23] in that direction?
[00:22:25] Well, I think that the story of Cain Enable is really very tightly constructed representation
[00:22:32] of that process.
[00:22:33] Because I mean, it's a very strange story because, well, for a variety of reasons, first
[00:22:38] of all, it's very ancient.
[00:22:40] Second of all, it's the first story about human beings mythologically speaking within
[00:22:44] the Judeo-Christian canon.
[00:22:47] Let's say, because Adam and Eve aren't real people, right?
[00:22:49] Because they are formed by God.
[00:22:52] And in April, they're the first people and they're a pair of hostile brothers.
[00:22:55] And so the first thing that says is that sibling tension within families is a universal
[00:23:01] truth and that can get murderous.
[00:23:03] And if you don't know that and you can't see that, then you're not watching your children
[00:23:08] carefully enough.
[00:23:09] So because what siblings can torment each other to a great degree, and it's something
[00:23:14] that you should strive diligently to observe and to quail.
[00:23:20] But then there's the next part of it that's so interesting is the idea of sacrifices
[00:23:25] is introduced.
[00:23:27] And it took me a long time to understand what sacrifice meant.
[00:23:32] Because on the surface of it, especially the way it's acted out, like burnt offerings
[00:23:36] and that sort of thing, it just seems like, well, it seems so archaic and distant from us
[00:23:41] that it's not really comprehensible.
[00:23:42] But partly from reading Jean-Pierge, I started, and Nietzsche for that matter, I started to
[00:23:47] understand that people often acted out conceptions before they understood what they meant.
[00:23:52] And we act out a lot of things we don't understand because we're much more complex than
[00:23:56] we can represent.
[00:23:57] So we're always acting out things we don't understand.
[00:24:00] But so there's this idea in Canaan Abel that you have to make sacrifices in order to
[00:24:06] stay on the good side of God.
[00:24:08] And so I thought about that practically, say, not so much metaphysically, but practically
[00:24:14] and realized that that was equivalent to the discovery of time of the future.
[00:24:19] Because we do act, and this is a peculiar discovery of human beings, and maybe a consequence
[00:24:24] of our expanded intelligence is that we're actually aware of the future.
[00:24:28] And we actually treat the future as if it's something that you can bargain with.
[00:24:32] Now partly, it's because the future is other people, and they remember your reputation,
[00:24:36] they remember your past actions.
[00:24:38] And if you do someone a favor, then that favor is in some sense stored up in the future.
[00:24:43] So you can think about the future as a place of judgment about your moral actions.
[00:24:48] And it's not that far from that to imagining a God who's keeping track of that or who
[00:24:53] even is that.
[00:24:53] But in any case, the idea of sacrifice emerges in the story of Canaan Abel and Canaan
[00:25:00] and Abel both makes sacrifices to God in order to stay on his good side, let's say.
[00:25:05] And what a sacrifice means is that you give up something of value in the present so that
[00:25:10] you can improve the future.
[00:25:14] And that's no different from what we call discipline.
[00:25:17] It's exactly the same thing.
[00:25:18] It's just that concretely acted out version of that.
[00:25:21] And so the idea basically was that God was in the transcendent heavens.
[00:25:29] And the first question would be, well, why is that?
[00:25:31] And it's like, well, if you go out in a really dark night and look up at the sky, you
[00:25:36] have a sense of what's beyond you, what's transcendent, what's infinite.
[00:25:41] And so to associate that with the highest values is a reasonable association, right, from a,
[00:25:47] say, from an emotional point of view.
[00:25:49] So it's not particularly primitive.
[00:25:51] It's a smart metaphor or it's a smart intuition.
[00:25:57] And it's above you.
[00:25:58] And we tend to think of when you're moving towards an ideal that you're moving up, that
[00:26:01] you're moving above, you're moving to the mountain top, right?
[00:26:04] You're going up, not down.
[00:26:05] And so it all sits within that same framework.
[00:26:09] And it's partly because when you go up like on a mountain, you can see for long distances,
[00:26:13] right?
[00:26:14] So those, those things are tangled together.
[00:26:16] So anyways, so the idea is that you have to give up something of value now, so you,
[00:26:22] so that you make the future better.
[00:26:24] And sometimes it's even something you love now.
[00:26:27] And that's a good example too, because often the things that stop us from moving forward
[00:26:32] are attachments to things that we should no longer be attached to, right?
[00:26:37] And in fact, you can almost make that definitional.
[00:26:40] If you're not moving forward in your life, there's a high probability that you have
[00:26:44] some idea or some mode of action or some habit that you're so in love with that you
[00:26:49] won't let go of it.
[00:26:51] So all right, so can an able, can an able makes sacrifices.
[00:26:54] And there's kind of a hint in the story that it's just a hint that can sacrifice
[00:27:00] their sort of second rate, but in any case, it's ambivalent, eh?
[00:27:04] But, but, but, able, he just does wonderfully well and everything works out for him.
[00:27:10] And everyone knows people like that, you know?
[00:27:12] And so God accepts his sacrifices, but for some reason he rejects canes.
[00:27:18] And maybe it's the arbitrariness of God or maybe it's because canes heart isn't in the right
[00:27:23] place when he's making his sacrifices, which is more likely.
[00:27:27] And so canes goes and has a chat with God and he says, basically what he says is something
[00:27:31] like, how in the world can you possibly justify this universe that you created?
[00:27:37] You look at me and I'm breaking myself and half trying to adapt and to make things right.
[00:27:42] And it's not working.
[00:27:44] And then there's this able character and things come easy to him and everything is flourishing
[00:27:49] for him.
[00:27:50] And so like, what the hell?
[00:27:52] And if you don't understand that question, then you're not thinking.
[00:27:56] Because it's very, very frequently the case when a serious catastrophe be sets you in life
[00:28:02] that you essentially ask exactly that question, what's the meaning of life, what's the purpose
[00:28:06] of the world, how come they're suffering and it's easy to become resentful and vengeful
[00:28:11] as a consequence of that.
[00:28:12] And so you go to think about what state of mind having your sacrifices rejected puts you
[00:28:18] and especially when you see someone who's successful because that's where the jealousy
[00:28:23] and resentment starts to, starts to, what, faster is probably the right word.
[00:28:30] And so God says to King exactly what he doesn't want to hear, which is, well yeah, okay,
[00:28:37] but you have made lots of mistakes in your life.
[00:28:40] So he basically says, sin is at your door like a predatory and sexually aroused animal
[00:28:45] and you've invited it into your house to have its way with you and produced something
[00:28:49] creative as a consequence.
[00:28:51] So he uses sexual metaphor, you know, and so that you've willingly gone down the negative
[00:28:56] path and you've allowed that to enter into you and to operate in a creative manner
[00:29:02] and you've spun off all these terrible thoughts and this justification for not acting properly
[00:29:07] and that's why things aren't going well for you and so don't lay that at my feet, which
[00:29:12] is the most brutal possible message he could have got.
[00:29:16] And so then he leaves the presence of God, let's say, and it says in the story that
[00:29:21] is countenance, fell, which meant he was basically enraged and so what does he do?
[00:29:25] He goes out and kills Abel and then that's a very fascinating idea because Abel is his
[00:29:32] ideal, so it kills his ideal and when you kill your ideal, you're lost and then he
[00:29:38] does that to take revenge on Abel but also to take revenge on God, which I think is extremely
[00:29:43] interesting and a deep idea, like these kids who shoot up high schools, for example,
[00:29:49] you cannot understand what they're doing unless you understand the story of Cain enabled,
[00:29:54] you cannot understand what possesses them until you can understand that someone, even someone
[00:29:59] who doesn't believe, it doesn't matter, it's the psychological state of mind that
[00:30:03] matters, is there out for revenge on being itself and that's why they produce as much
[00:30:08] may him as possible in the shortest period of time, that's why they sacrifice innocent
[00:30:13] people because it's much more vengeful and demonstrative to kill innocent people than to kill
[00:30:21] guilty people, because it's a worse sin, so to speak, and then they kill themselves and
[00:30:27] they kill themselves as a final demonstration of their belief in the nihilism and the horror
[00:30:33] of existence, because you might say, well, I don't they just kill themselves first and
[00:30:37] say, everyone the trouble, you know, and there's narcissism in that too, because they know
[00:30:41] their names are going to be splashed across the page, that's their notoriety instead
[00:30:45] of their accomplishment and of course the media is unbelievably complicit in that, but well,
[00:30:52] so when you're talking about motivation for evil, then you have to understand what it is
[00:30:57] that's driving it and it is a deep resentment about the structure of being for being
[00:31:03] what's saturated with suffering, but also for rejecting your sacrifices and that produces
[00:31:11] the bitterness of failure and I'll stop with this.
[00:31:15] One of the things that's really interesting about the Old Testament is that and the Jews
[00:31:19] in the Old Testament is that they don't take the path of pain, every time they're walloped
[00:31:24] by God, which is fairly frequently, they say, we must have done something wrong and we
[00:31:30] have to set ourselves right and that's an unbelievably heroic attitude because that's the
[00:31:37] alternative to cursing fate.
[00:31:39] It's like you take the responsibility for failure onto yourself and you think, well, if
[00:31:44] I was just maybe if I just had my act together a little bit more, if I took advantage
[00:31:49] of every opportunity that was put in front of me, if I wasn't resentful and bitter, then
[00:31:54] I could have done something that would have tilted the situation in a different direction
[00:31:59] and that's almost inevitably true.
[00:32:01] Well, it's interesting and again, this is kind of where when I would hear you say things
[00:32:05] like that, so as you know, I wrote a book called Extreme Ownership, the opening chapter
[00:32:10] of the book is a horrible situation with a fracturicide happens on the battlefield so
[00:32:14] friendly forces, killing friendly forces, some of those forces being mine and you know, it's
[00:32:22] all these people I could blame and all these little incidents that happened that I could
[00:32:26] visit well, you know, we had this radio cryptographic change that happened in the middle
[00:32:30] of operation and it had people weren't able to talk to each other and we had these Iraqis
[00:32:34] that we didn't speak English, we had these units that we hadn't worked with before and
[00:32:38] they did things that we didn't expect and there's plenty of blame to go around and and
[00:32:43] essentially I said, hey, you know, whose fault this is, this is my fault on the commander.
[00:32:48] And so when I hear you say things like that, it strikes me that you uncovered this through
[00:32:54] your study of history and philosophy and religion and I learned it, you know, as like
[00:33:01] I said a certified knuckle dragger out on the battlefield that realized, you know, if you're
[00:33:07] going to exist as a leader and as a human, then you need to take responsibility for what
[00:33:12] happens around you and that's a good idea.
[00:33:15] Yeah, you have to take, well, the religious notion in some sense is that you have to take
[00:33:19] ultimate responsibility in that in some sense the things that happen around you.
[00:33:25] I mean, this is, does deevsky, I think, said something like every man is responsible for
[00:33:31] everything that happens to him and everything that happens to everyone else and that's, you
[00:33:35] know, that's a crazy statement, right?
[00:33:38] It's a crazy statement and he was a pretty extreme person in many, many ways but there's
[00:33:44] a level at which that's metaphysically true, you know, because what happens is that it's
[00:33:50] failure to act often, that's the most catastrophic, you know, I mean, it's to not do the right
[00:33:58] thing when the situation presents itself and it's very specific, you know, you're constantly
[00:34:06] in situations where you could do the right thing if you were willing to take a risk that's
[00:34:12] actually of relatively moderate size and you know that you could take the risk and you know
[00:34:18] that you should take the risk and you don't.
[00:34:21] That happens to people all the time and then what happens is the thing that they didn't
[00:34:25] oppose grows a little bit and they shrink a little bit and that starts a loop, hey and so
[00:34:32] and you say, well, how do you take responsibility for the world and answer is, well, you also
[00:34:37] have to do it with a certain degree of humility because what do you know, you know, and
[00:34:42] this is part of the reason that I'm so opposed to the activist culture on college campuses,
[00:34:46] you don't teach 18-year-olds to go and demonstrate about capitalism, you know, because they don't
[00:34:52] know anything and they have problems in their own life that need to be solved that are local
[00:34:57] and the local problems aren't trivial, you know, they're not disciplined, they're, they're not
[00:35:02] looking at the world in a straight way, they're not taking responsibility for themselves or for their
[00:35:07] actions, their sexual actions among others, they're not taking responsibility for their
[00:35:11] family, they're not looking at how they could contribute to the community, they don't understand
[00:35:15] the fact that they don't know anything and so they should be taught to start locally and to put
[00:35:21] things together that they could put together, you know, to make their bed and to clean up the room
[00:35:26] and to attend their classes with regularity if they're going to university because that's part of
[00:35:31] the implicit contract and to straighten up the things around them that are actually within their
[00:35:36] power to straighten up and then what happens is that if you do that, let's say religiously,
[00:35:42] which I suppose would be the same as in a discipline manner, that your realm of influence
[00:35:48] starts to grow but it grows in a positive way, just like you can go, you can end up in hell one
[00:35:54] step at a time and that's extraordinarily well documented, you can end up at the opposite place
[00:36:01] of that one step at a time but it's also that same gradual process, you don't get to
[00:36:06] leap from being a 17 year old nothead who doesn't know anything and who isn't disciplined to
[00:36:12] the critic of Judeo-Christian society, you just don't know enough to do that, especially when you
[00:36:17] can look at your own life and think about how many things that you're doing that you know
[00:36:22] or wrong that you could fix that you aren't fixing and that's the crucial thing, this isn't
[00:36:27] this mode of thinking isn't asking people to stretch themselves beyond what they're capable of,
[00:36:33] it's just asking them to stretch themselves to the point that they are capable of and seeing
[00:36:38] what happens and that works, it works, I've had many people write me over the last year and this
[00:36:44] is a great thing really, it's a great thing who said that they stopped started to tell the truth
[00:36:49] or at least not to lie because who can tell the truth right but at least you can not lie
[00:36:54] and that they started to put things in order around them that they could put in order and that
[00:36:58] you know the pause of things just started to happen like mad and they're not nihilistic
[00:37:04] and they've got a purpose in their life and so you know thank God for that and it does work.
[00:37:09] So let's try to think of how to stop the loop of my sacrifices have been rejected and the
[00:37:17] way that you stop that loop is instead of saying my sacrifices were rejected so my hard work,
[00:37:24] my effort, everything that I'm doing to try and move forward it's not working and if you want to
[00:37:31] go towards hell you keep saying well it's not working but it's because of everyone else it's
[00:37:36] they're rejecting me they're not accepting what I've done. Whereas if you say to yourself oh it
[00:37:42] didn't work okay it's my fault what can I do better and that's how you start moving in the other
[00:37:46] direction which is yeah well at least you have control and you know you don't even necessarily
[00:37:51] have to think it's your fault although that's that's a reasonable way of looking at it you could
[00:37:55] you could minimally just accept the fact that it's your responsibility you're stuck with it and
[00:38:01] you could actually change it and once you know too that if you're failing repeatedly
[00:38:08] then there's probably something wrong it's possible that there's something wrong with the way
[00:38:13] that you're conceptualizing the world because you have a choice right if if you keep
[00:38:17] making sacrifices and they don't work there's a binary choice and one is well there's something
[00:38:24] wrong with the structure of reality and the other is there's something wrong with your approach
[00:38:30] and so then you might say well let's take the first idea there's something wrong with the
[00:38:34] structure of reality it's like you're really gonna say that are you you're really gonna come out and
[00:38:38] say I know enough to judge the nature of being and and then the alternative is also quite
[00:38:45] frightening because then you know it's you that's making the mistakes and you might be wrong
[00:38:49] at a really deep level and that might mean that a lot of you has to burn off and be transformed
[00:38:55] maybe even things about yourself that you think are admirable and that you like because your position
[00:38:59] you know yourself conceptualization is so warped and wrong and that's really daunting but you know
[00:39:06] when people set themselves up as the judge of being mean I've written about this a fair bit in my
[00:39:11] new book which is called 12 rules for life when people set themselves up as the judge of being
[00:39:16] then they take on what can only be described as a kind of satanic arrogance because they've actually
[00:39:23] taken to themselves the moral right to criticize the structure of existence itself it's like you better
[00:39:29] be careful when you do something like that because you're setting yourself up as the judge of being
[00:39:34] the Columbine kids did that like if you read what they wrote it's that's exactly what happened
[00:39:41] it that's exactly what they say is that you know I've taken on to myself the task of the
[00:39:45] judge of being and found it wanting and so I'm going to cause as much mayhem as I possibly can
[00:39:50] before I you know before I depart and that's a very common story among people who do that sort of
[00:39:57] thing it's and it's so interesting because every time something like that happens people go
[00:40:01] well we don't understand it's like no you won't understand because they write about what they're doing
[00:40:07] they tell you why they're doing it but it's so it cuts too close to the bone for people
[00:40:12] and so they think well we don't understand how that can happen you know like there was a
[00:40:17] awhile back I think it wasn't Connecticut whether it was a bunch of elementary school kids shot right
[00:40:21] because this is kind of a one-upmanship game and it's bad enough to shoot high school kids but
[00:40:26] it's even worse to shoot kindergarten and elementary kids because they're even clearly more innocent
[00:40:31] it's like well that's that's part of that vengeful spirit you know better to punish the
[00:40:37] innocent than the guilty if you're trying to make a statement about your your hatred for the
[00:40:41] structure of reality and these things you have to understand these things really you have to
[00:40:46] understand the matter religious level of analysis because there's no well that's what happens
[00:40:50] when you encounter evil is that you're into the domain that can only be described by religious
[00:40:56] ideation and I don't say that lightly you know I've had many veterans come to talk to me now and
[00:41:01] there are people who had post-traumatic stress disorder and they've said that listening to my
[00:41:06] lectures has helped them out a lot because it's provided them with a philosophy of good and evil
[00:41:11] and if you have post-traumatic stress disorder you need a sophisticated philosophy of good and evil
[00:41:15] because otherwise you don't have any place to put your experiences and that fragments and shatters
[00:41:20] you it's no it's no trivial matter to be touched by malevolence or to have it manifested
[00:41:27] self within you unexpectedly you know it's it it it it's physiologically destructive it it
[00:41:34] shatters people and you have to move from a naive interpretation of the world to a very
[00:41:41] deep interpretation of the world if you're ever going to dig yourself out of that hole
[00:41:44] you know that's that's interesting and one of the one of the things that I was going to tell you or
[00:41:49] ask you about so when I was a kid I wanted to be a commando like I don't really remember
[00:41:58] wanting to do anything else when I realized that there was that role that you could play in life
[00:42:04] that's what I wanted to do and and a lot of my friends in the seal teams were the same way that's
[00:42:10] what they wanted to do and as soon as they figured out like oh that's that exists oh I can do that
[00:42:15] and I just have to sign this piece of paper and go do this stuff and then that's what I'll be
[00:42:20] where does that come from? Well I mean that that's a very good question I mean I would say it's
[00:42:29] temperamental you know people differ tremendously in their temperaments and to think that there's a
[00:42:34] warrior temperament is a perfectly reasonable thing to think I mean there's been whole cultures many
[00:42:39] many cultures who were devoted to fostering that warrior mentality you know where if you weren't
[00:42:45] like that you were the outlier I would say that's probably true of most human cultures across
[00:42:50] most of time you know we've been fortunate enough to live in relatively peaceful times at least
[00:42:55] the vast majority of us so the necessity for that like right at the edges of actual warfare
[00:43:02] is much less than it might be under other historical circumstances but but it's it's it's a deep
[00:43:10] part of of of many people's nature and so the question is what do you do with that right and I mean
[00:43:18] one alternative potential potentially is criminal behavior and you know the fact that so many
[00:43:23] people like watching movies about bad guys you know is an indication of how attractive that is to
[00:43:31] people and I think the reason for that is is that well Nietzsche observed at one point that most of
[00:43:36] what people regard as morality is just cowardice and what he meant by that was that people don't
[00:43:42] do bad things not because they're good but because they're afraid to do the bad things and then when
[00:43:47] they see people do the bad things they're actually really deeply attracted by that because it speaks
[00:43:52] to part of them that could go beyond the rules and that's actually a necessary part it's a really
[00:43:57] necessary part like you don't make men safe by making them weak in fact there are much more
[00:44:03] dangerous when they're weak because they'll stab you in the back when they get the chance or take
[00:44:07] advantage of you when you when they get the chance you make men safe let's say by making them
[00:44:13] strong and then by making sure that they're disciplined and so you know you've got people like you
[00:44:19] have got this let's say warrior mentality that's a part deep part of their temperament and then you
[00:44:25] have some choices about what you might do with that you might try to discipline it and bring it
[00:44:30] under voluntary control and integrate it into your character in which it then it can make you someone
[00:44:36] who's stalwart and indomitable and who will move forward you know in the face of tremendous risk
[00:44:44] and well that's the optimal that's the optimal pathway if you have that kind of temperament and
[00:44:51] I think like it's the men that have the most what would you call it it's not aggressive exactly
[00:44:57] but we'll we'll leave it at that aggressive and fearless temperaments that can be the best man but
[00:45:03] it's like having a very powerful dog you better civil you better discipline because otherwise it's
[00:45:09] going to be a monster yeah well I had the I was a rebellious kid right and I could have
[00:45:19] easily gone down the path of crime and as a matter of fact many of my friends that I you know
[00:45:25] left when they stayed in the at home they they did end up as criminals and having big trouble
[00:45:32] with the law or going down even paths of drugs and everything else that you can get into but
[00:45:37] but when we were kids or younger everyone kind of had the same thing but like you said I kind of
[00:45:43] do I so lucky because I just signed that piece of paper and I saw that I could do something
[00:45:50] and I could take all that aggression and all that energy I could do something that was good
[00:45:57] and positive and and we joke about that in the seal teams that many guys you you actually to be a
[00:46:03] good seal you sort of you sort of have this criminal mindset that you you somehow harness and you
[00:46:11] keep under control most of the time and occasionally it does get out of hand and we got guys
[00:46:16] that get in trouble and that happens and if we if we only took guys that would never get in trouble
[00:46:22] we wouldn't have anyone in the ranks really well you know well you also see too in the classic
[00:46:27] hero stories I mean you see this with Harry Potter for example which I'm making reference to
[00:46:31] because it was such a phenomena I mean when when when something makes welfare mother richer than
[00:46:38] the Queen of England you shouldn't take note right and when when kids are reading 500 page books
[00:46:44] and standing and lying waiting for the next one and when you produce a whole movie empire around
[00:46:49] something you should take note of that well Harry Potter's little team aren't the delinquents
[00:46:55] right who have no discipline but they're also not the good kids they're the kids who will
[00:47:00] break rules when necessary and that's that's the issue break rules when necessary now the question
[00:47:07] is when is that necessary well that's sort of the ultimate ethical choice but you know you're
[00:47:14] why did that work for you do you think you know like why was it well two questions one would be
[00:47:22] why did you decide to step into a discipline structure I mean that's obviously very difficult
[00:47:29] and why do you think you did that and some of the other kids that you knew that were like you
[00:47:34] didn't it was really one of the most rebellious things that I could do was to join the military so
[00:47:43] I come from a small New England town people get done with high school they go to college they
[00:47:48] get a job as whatever people get jobs as they follow that very normal path and and I didn't even
[00:47:54] know anyone that joined the military and and so that was the most rebellious thing I could do
[00:48:00] oh college no education no I'm gonna go be a commando that's what I'm gonna do and and it was the
[00:48:07] most rebellious thing I could do I think that's one of the reasons why I did it it was also a complete
[00:48:12] break away from you know family okay I have I will have no reliance on you you know I'm going
[00:48:19] you don't have to worry about me anymore I'm done I will not rely on anyone else I will be
[00:48:24] self-reliant which I wanted to do and so I think those are the main things that got me there
[00:48:30] and then what's great about it for me was when I got there you have a completely blank slate and
[00:48:36] you have very clear directions of what you need to do to to ascend the the dominance hierarchy
[00:48:44] you do this you do this you follow these rules you you literally fold your underwear in this way
[00:48:50] when you're going through boot camp and you get a better grade on your military performance so
[00:48:54] they give you very clear rules that you're supposed to follow and very clear tasks that you
[00:48:58] had to do and it was great for me because it was a blank slate because when I was in high school
[00:49:02] I was a I was a screw up not bad but not good and and so I hadn't really set myself up properly
[00:49:10] and now all of a sudden all I had to do that that was all gone it didn't matter that the past
[00:49:13] did not matter at all I had a completely blank slate if you do this stuff properly you'll you'll
[00:49:18] do well and you'll ascend that yeah well that's that's a very interesting thing because then it's
[00:49:24] not merely a matter of following a set of arbitrary rules it's following a set of rules that have
[00:49:29] a clear path to success right that's a very different thing and and that that's also something
[00:49:34] that's honest because the rules of the game are well established and then if you play it properly
[00:49:38] you get to win and that's a big deal as well you know and you mentioned the seal types and I've
[00:49:44] met a number of people like that you know they're they're they're capable of breaking rules let's
[00:49:51] say or maybe even inclined to break them but I also think that that's this is part of the
[00:49:56] reason that I'm I admire of Carl Jung because Jung makes it very clear that see he was very
[00:50:02] interested in the barriers to enlightenment because if there's if there's such a thing as being
[00:50:07] enlightened let's say then why isn't everyone enlightened if it's just a matter of taking the glorious
[00:50:13] route and and following your bliss let's say it's like well that sounds pretty easy why isn't
[00:50:21] everyone enlightened and but Jung's thinking isn't like that at all you know he he believed that
[00:50:26] in order to transform your personality that first of all you had to be disciplined that's for sure
[00:50:31] but you also had to integrate that part of you that was terrible and capable of breaking rules and
[00:50:36] make it part of you and so then and I really like that idea well here here's an example so about
[00:50:42] 20 years ago I would say there was a newspaper headline in one account it is major news papers and
[00:50:49] it was the minister of foreign affairs at that time Lloyd Axe were the and he was talking about what
[00:50:53] had happened with uh Melosovic in in the former Soviet Union in Yugoslavia and the atrocities
[00:51:00] that were being committed and he said that he he was caught on a wearous by that because he didn't
[00:51:05] have the imagination for that kind of evil and I thought well you know you think that what you're
[00:51:12] doing is signaling your virtue by making a statement like that but from my perspective all you're
[00:51:17] doing is stating your cowardice and your historical ignorance because if you're going to be minister
[00:51:22] of foreign affairs you bloody well better have imagination for that kind of evil because if you
[00:51:27] don't then anyone who does wins they beat you and so you you know again in the Harry Potter
[00:51:32] stories you see he's touched by evil right he he actually has a soul fragment that's embedded
[00:51:39] within him that's as black as anything and possibly be that's why he could talk to snakes but without
[00:51:45] that he wouldn't be able to have any victory and that's exactly right psychologically unless you
[00:51:51] can think the way that an evil person thinks then you're defenseless against them because they'll
[00:51:56] go places you can't imagine and then they win and so the best man I've met that was interesting
[00:52:02] even when I was in junior high in high school because most of my friends dropped out you know by
[00:52:06] the time they're grade 10 they're about and a lot of them were guys who developed physically they're
[00:52:11] pretty powerful and they're just damn sick and put up their hand to go to the bathroom and
[00:52:14] it's like you know they're not doing that anymore one of my friends got kicked out when he sort
[00:52:19] of challenged the gym teacher you know physically and the gym teacher he could do an iron cross he
[00:52:24] was a tough guy and so it was no trivial matter for my friend to stand up to him but he got expelled
[00:52:29] anyways but you know I noticed that it wasn't it was often the kids whose character I admired that
[00:52:36] either Quater God expelled and they were the tougher guys who were just sick and tired of
[00:52:41] following rules that didn't take into account their character and then they'd go off and work
[00:52:46] in the oil rigs or whatever and you could do that now bird at that time that was really hard work you know
[00:52:51] so it wasn't like they were necessarily taking the easy path but like a harmless man is not a
[00:52:57] good man a good man is a very very dangerous man who has that under voluntary control and you know
[00:53:04] you also see that like one of the central female stories let's say if the hero archetype is the
[00:53:13] central male story there are variants of hero archetypes that are relevant to women and one of
[00:53:17] them is beauty in the beast and you know beauty isn't interested in the guy who isn't the beast
[00:53:24] she's interested in the guy who's the beast and that's exactly right but she's interested in the
[00:53:29] guy who's the beast that can be civilized and disciplined right and who can use that in the
[00:53:34] service while let's say of a family and and that's exactly well that's exactly how it should be
[00:53:41] so I gave a speech one of my very good friends got married a few years ago and I gave a speech
[00:53:48] and at this speech he was a friend of mine see you and at this speech I was talking about what
[00:53:57] it was to be a man and what when I felt like I was a man and I said there were three things that
[00:54:05] that I felt let me transition from being you know mentally insecure about who I was as a person
[00:54:15] it had being okay I'm actually good with who I am number one was learning how to fight
[00:54:21] and you know I got into presenting jiu-jitsu and mixed martial arts and I learned how to fight and now
[00:54:28] all the sudden when I looked at other people I didn't I wasn't posturing I wasn't trying to pretend
[00:54:33] that I was tough I was I knew that most people that I would encounter I could do defeat in a physical
[00:54:39] altercation that was number one number two is going into combat because even though you might be tough
[00:54:45] in a you know street fighter in a fist fight with someone when you're facing death well that's a
[00:54:51] whole another level and for me going into combat well what was I gonna act like was I gonna be scared
[00:54:57] was I gonna be a coward was I gonna be scared of death and when I went into combat I wasn't I was
[00:55:02] fine I was okay with the fact that I could die and I was okay with that and I made good decisions
[00:55:09] and and did what I was supposed to do and the last one was I got married and had kids
[00:55:17] because all of a sudden all these things these being aggressive and working to fight and be able to
[00:55:24] destroy in an efficient way well then I took that and combined it with okay now I'm gonna take
[00:55:29] her these my wife and our children and that's what I'm gonna do and at my point in
[00:55:34] giving this speech was he was a guy that had learned how to fight he was a guy that had been in combat
[00:55:38] and now there was one more step to take which was okay now you're gonna get married and you're
[00:55:43] gonna take care of these people so it's interesting that that once again that dichotomy that
[00:55:47] that you talk about it fits perfectly into the way I think it things out as a guy that went to
[00:55:54] high school and joined the military it's kind of it's kind of amazing that reinforces what you
[00:55:59] always say which is that there's there's deeper meaning there's a reason why I'm thinking that
[00:56:03] and the reason is because I've because of the things that you talk about in the way these things
[00:56:08] are overlaid throughout history for human beings who have gotten to this point yeah well you acted
[00:56:12] it out you know which is what you're supposed to do and it's also it's better to act it out
[00:56:17] and to understand it you know that's that's best it's better it's better to understand it and
[00:56:22] not acted out then to not understand it at all but the best is to act it out and understand it
[00:56:28] and because then you can you know then then the way that you represent the world and yourself
[00:56:32] is in accordance with the way that you act and that's that's that's optimized yeah it's it's
[00:56:37] something that I was kind of acting out again no no real guy like my guidelines were like I
[00:56:43] was raised in the seal teams that that was sort of my guidelines and here's a good example when
[00:56:47] I first got in the seal teams there's no war going on so what did what did a good seal do you
[00:56:52] know you did you went out and drank and got barfights that's a good seal did so you know what I did
[00:56:56] went out and drank got barfights that's what okay that's what I'm supposed to do it took me
[00:57:00] a while to figure out no there's actually something more than that like we're actually supposed to
[00:57:03] be preparing for war and and and so now like you said I definitely acted things out and sort of
[00:57:12] was on a decent path but as I got older and more mature and to this day as I can look around and
[00:57:18] and actually overlay the understanding on the way I've carried out my life is very it's very
[00:57:23] helpful to me and it's also helps me explain it to other people that see the path at all and go
[00:57:29] they they like that path they would like to join me on that path and I get guys that you know when I was in
[00:57:35] I you know I kind I look like a serial killer for all practical purposes that's the way I come across right
[00:57:42] it was not creepy enough there's there's guys that would you know guys that would work
[00:57:50] from you guys that would be around me and they'd see me and they'd kind of latch on to the fact that
[00:57:54] I was tough and aggressive and and and some of those guys they wouldn't catch the other part which was
[00:58:00] that I was politically savvy and I was working and I was maneuvering and I was you know figuring things
[00:58:06] out and talking to my boss in such a way that we could get what we needed to be and I was doing that
[00:58:11] whole other side and so I'd get these guys that would end up not doing this well as they should do
[00:58:16] because they were just hey jocos just ultra aggressive and he gets after it and so that's what I'm
[00:58:20] going to do and I'll be in the same place the guys that would do well the guys that said oh yeah jocos
[00:58:24] awesome and he's aggressive and he gets after it he's also working and he's also maneuvering and he's also
[00:58:29] massaging the eagles of the people around him so make sure that he didn't get to position in a right
[00:58:33] spot where they can go to war in the right way and and so as I've got an old drive been able to tell
[00:58:40] people that more clearly like hey it's not just about that side of the ultra aggressive you got to be aggressive
[00:58:46] you got to be willing to fight you got to be a willing to kill and you got to be willing to die
[00:58:49] at the same time you got to be able to tamper and tamper all those things in such a way that they
[00:58:56] can be controlled and disciplined well I also think that that's part of what makes a world peaceful
[00:59:00] in the final analysis because if you're around people who are dangerous but disciplined then
[00:59:07] everyone watches their step and that's exactly what should happen everybody should watch their
[00:59:13] step and if you if there's no reason for that then well there's no there's no sanction for for poor
[00:59:20] behavior for example like I mean if you if you're going to discipline a child the child has to be
[00:59:25] convinced that your force that's worthy of paying attention to you know I see kids there's a chapter in
[00:59:33] my book called don't ever don't let your children do anything that makes you dislike them and I'm
[00:59:39] pretty happy about this chapter all the way suspect it'll be rather controversial and you know
[00:59:44] it's predicated first on the observation that many people hurt their children physically and
[00:59:49] psychologically you know because everyone gets sentimental about the relationship between parents and
[00:59:54] children but that's especially in relationship to themselves because they think well you know of course
[01:00:00] I'm going to be a good parent it's like it's not so bloody obvious that you're going to be a good parent
[01:00:05] you know and so and then what I see happening with people who don't know how to discipline their children
[01:00:11] is that the children run roughshod over them in their let's call them higher article disputes
[01:00:17] because children push for position and hierarchy and they do that behaviorally to sort of
[01:00:22] feel out the contours of the social structure so you know your kid will act perfectly fine
[01:00:27] at home let's say at at the dinner table but then you take them to a stranger's dinner table
[01:00:31] and all of a sudden they act out and you think what's up with you a little monster and what's
[01:00:35] up is that they're trying to figure out what the power structure is in the new they don't know this
[01:00:40] of course but they're acting this out they're trying to figure out if the same rules apply in this
[01:00:44] new situation as apply in the old situation and they can't ask that and they don't even know that
[01:00:49] they are rules exactly they're regularities that they've learned and so they'll test and test and
[01:00:55] then you have to show them that yeah it's the same here it's the same in this situation
[01:00:59] but lots of parents are very uneasy with disciplining their children partly because they believe
[01:01:06] that if you give a child infinite freedom that's best for them and that constraints are inappropriate
[01:01:11] which is really just well I don't know what to say about that except it's so untrue that
[01:01:16] that it's very difficult to think of anything that's more untrue than that but also the thing is
[01:01:21] is if you let your children take advantage of you if you have an ounce of spine and an ounce of
[01:01:27] aggression which you do especially if you don't admit it then you will take revenge on your children
[01:01:34] you know so if they have a temper tantrum in a grocery store in embarrass you which a child whose
[01:01:39] canny can do quite effectively you know because you wouldn't let them have that pack of crayons or a
[01:01:43] chocolate bar and then you know you tell yourself it's okay and that you still you know that
[01:01:49] that really didn't make you that angry and it's okay but you're filming inside and then you go home
[01:01:54] and half an hour later maybe the child is doing some interesting little bit of work maybe art work or
[01:01:59] something or does something good and comes up for a reward it's like the probability that you're
[01:02:04] going to reward that child properly under those circumstances zero you're going to take the
[01:02:09] opportunity to take your revenge and if you don't know that then you're not much of the parent and so
[01:02:15] part of the trick with kids is that if your child is doing something that makes you dislike them
[01:02:21] that you have to figure out how to stop them from doing that and teach them how to do it properly
[01:02:25] you have to talk to your wife to make sure that you're not being too much of a monster you know
[01:02:29] on the same with her but that that discipline is partly what enables you to continue to like your
[01:02:37] child well you love them and even more than that you know parents talk about fostering self esteem
[01:02:43] and fostering creativity and all of that in their kids and I think that's miss begotten
[01:02:47] it's shallow for a variety of reasons first it's not that easy to foster creativity because it's
[01:02:54] rare and self esteem is a very badly defined concept and mostly it's been used for harm not good
[01:03:00] what your job is as a parent is to help your child learn from between two years old and say four
[01:03:08] years old how to act in the world so that when people encounter them people smile and are happy they're
[01:03:14] around because then you know I've seen kids who behave badly and everywhere they go people where
[01:03:20] false smiles and everywhere they go people are relieved when they leave and that means you think
[01:03:25] about that world from the child's perspective everyone's lying and everyone hates them that's
[01:03:32] their world and then if you have your child you know capable of adhering to minimal social
[01:03:39] requirements like maybe being able to sit at the table in a civilized manner for an hour and being
[01:03:45] grateful for being fed let's say and knowing how to share and knowing how to pay attention to adults
[01:03:51] and not having that you know that kind of terrible cynicism and arrogance that can develop
[01:04:01] even in a four-year-old child who's always had its way then then they'll interact with adults in
[01:04:06] a manner that bring out the best in the adults and everywhere they go everyone smiles at them and
[01:04:11] pats them on the head maybe even tells them useful and interesting things and so the whole world
[01:04:15] opens up for them and that's all a consequence of you having enough courage to admit to yourself
[01:04:21] that your child can do things that you don't like and that you will take it out on them if you don't
[01:04:27] straighten it out and people don't like that idea because they think well I'd never do anything you know
[01:04:32] I love my child I'd never do anything to hurt them it's like yeah God right you know you're so
[01:04:38] you're so asleep if you think that that there's almost no hope for you you have to think
[01:04:44] I'm way bigger than this child and I'm way meaner and I'm way trickier and I'm way more unpredictable
[01:04:51] and so I better be very careful in my relationships with this child so that the worst of me doesn't
[01:04:57] come out and then that gives you enough intelligence to make a disciplinary framework that's minimal
[01:05:04] and enforce it properly and carefully and then you can have an unbelievably good relationship with your
[01:05:09] kids so and this idea of discipline obviously I talk about discipline a lot and one of the things
[01:05:17] you were talking about earlier with regards to veterans and people that have listened to your
[01:05:23] lectures and it's the same thing with me people that listen to this podcast or read the books
[01:05:29] and and one of the things that I've noticed and I've talked about and I've gotten a lot of
[01:05:34] positive feedback on is you know when you're in the military you have this discipline and beyond the
[01:05:42] beyond the discipline that's imposed on you you also have a lot that you have to just hold the line
[01:05:46] yourself I mean when you're in the military sure you go through boot camp where there's a
[01:05:51] adrenaline struck the jelly and all that but once you're in the military you're doing what you have
[01:05:55] to do it self-discipline that you learn that and you become self-discipline and what happens is
[01:05:59] guys get out and that's that's gone and that hurts them and the other thing that hurts them
[01:06:09] is they don't know what their mission is anymore and and my big thing with people that I've been
[01:06:15] telling vets now is find what your next mission is go find whatever your next mission and I don't care
[01:06:20] what it is but it has to be something and I was listening to you talk on something the other day and
[01:06:25] and you were you were talking about how not doing anything when people are not going anywhere
[01:06:32] when they're when they're failing when they don't have the drive it's because they're not accepting
[01:06:38] responsibility for anything and and so my way of saying that is like you need a new mission you need
[01:06:43] to be responsible for something and you need to go and move towards some new mission
[01:06:49] and and do you encounter people that or you see people that's very problematic in the civilian
[01:06:55] side as well where people they just don't know what they're doing and don't take responsibility for anything
[01:06:59] that's part of this nihilism you know is that because first of all you learn that truth is relevant
[01:07:05] relative and that there's no real moral order and you know that alleviates you of responsibility
[01:07:10] and that's why that's such an attractive message to people but the problem is is that it kills you
[01:07:15] it kills your soul so to speak because well when we can talk about this technically so
[01:07:21] you know there are systems neurological systems that underlie your experience of negative emotion
[01:07:26] and there are neurological systems that underlie your experience of positive emotion and there are
[01:07:30] separate systems they obviously interact but there's separate systems so but the positive emotion
[01:07:37] system well there's two of them but one of them sort of kicks in when you get something that you
[01:07:42] want so you know you're hungry and you eat and that feels good and so that's kind of the simple one
[01:07:48] but there's a more sophisticated one that I think is even more active in people
[01:07:53] and it's the one that tells you that you're moving forward towards something worthwhile
[01:07:58] and that's actually the one that gives people that sense of meaningful engagement in their life
[01:08:03] on a moment to moment basis so and and it's also it's also something that doesn't have to go away
[01:08:11] like if you're hungry and you eat well that's good but it's over and then you're on to the next thing
[01:08:15] right it's not exactly sustaining it's just necessary that's called consumer territory reward by the
[01:08:20] way there's other reward system is incentive reward and the incentive reward system works on dopamine
[01:08:26] this neurochemical dopamine which is also the neurochemical tracks that opiates and cocaine and
[01:08:33] emphetamines the drugs that people really like to abuse alcohol often for some people
[01:08:37] activate and so you might say if you don't have enough meaning in your life then you're more prone to
[01:08:43] addiction and that's definitely the case even with rats if you take a rat you put him in a cage by
[01:08:48] himself and he has nothing to do and then you give him access to cocaine he'll get addicted to the
[01:08:52] point where he won't do anything but take cocaine but if you throw the rat back in with a bunch of other
[01:08:56] rats and he gets to do rat things then it's very hard to get him addicted to cocaine and so the
[01:09:01] purposeless rat is prone to addiction what's the same with human beings now here's a corollary to
[01:09:08] that which is really cool so the magnitude of the reward you experience as you're moving towards a
[01:09:15] goal is proportionate to the importance of the goal so that means the more important the goal you pick
[01:09:21] the more possibility there is for the kind of reward let's say it's really a state of being
[01:09:28] that is life affirming and it is directly life affirming in that you know like if you're in a
[01:09:33] football game and you're an important football game and maybe you break a finger and you know
[01:09:38] normally that's that's a problem it hurts and you're going to stop doing whatever you're doing but
[01:09:42] if you're right in the middle of the game then you'll be so amped up on this reward system that
[01:09:48] it's analgesic it stops the pain it also suppresses anxiety so if you have a purpose then
[01:09:55] it's analgesic it takes some of the pain out of life it's very positive in that it motivates
[01:10:00] and energizes you and focuses you and makes you able to remember and pay attention and it
[01:10:06] it quels fear and so those things are all direct and so then you might think well what's the best
[01:10:12] possible goal well and that's that's the purpose I would say of religious training and philosophical
[01:10:17] training it's like just what the hell are you doing in the world you know when I would say well
[01:10:21] that's actually fairly easy to also to also lay out and this is why nihilism is a much
[01:10:30] weaker philosophical position than it might appear to be it's like well there are lots of terrible
[01:10:36] things happening in the world if you're not I don't care if you're a believer in atheist or
[01:10:42] cynic of the highest sort you listen to a story like the one that you read at the beginning of the
[01:10:47] of this podcast and no one says well in a hundred thousand years who the hell cares so why does it
[01:10:53] matter no one says that they listen to that not if they're human they listen to that story and they think
[01:10:58] that's not good it's like that's right that's not good it's not good you should do something about that
[01:11:05] because it's it's it's it's it's it's self evidently not good so you might say well at least you can
[01:11:12] start your self organization by improving those things around you that are self evidently not good
[01:11:19] and that's easy man anybody can do this you can sit down for ten minutes say well I'm going to be honest
[01:11:24] with myself like that's a horrible thing to do I'm going to be honest with myself okay I'm probably
[01:11:29] doing a dozen stupid things that I could quit doing that are making my life less more ratchet
[01:11:37] and also the people around me and so you think okay what are those things and you know if you really
[01:11:42] want to know you have to want to know and you're going to get a bunch of information that you don't want to
[01:11:47] hear but you'll know it's true and you already knew it in some sense and then you can ask yourself okay
[01:11:53] that sucks and it's miserable and it's not very self affirming um is there one of those things I would
[01:12:02] I would be willing to do something about that I would actually do something about you know that I
[01:12:08] could do something about that I would do something about which is also another horrible question because
[01:12:14] soon as you get an answer to that then you have a responsibility right it's like oh god I have to
[01:12:18] go do that and it's something you don't want to do you don't want to do it that's why you've been
[01:12:22] avoiding it and so then it's right in front of you and it's like it's some little trivial horrible
[01:12:27] thing that you're not going to get a pat on the back for and no one's going to give you an award for it
[01:12:31] and and most people would just say Jesus you should have done that a long time ago you're more on
[01:12:36] and but then you go do it that's kind of humility I would say and then you keep doing that
[01:12:43] and it's like there's this injunction in the New Testament against praying in public
[01:12:49] you know and it's like virtue signaling it's like you don't pray in public because then you go out
[01:12:55] and you show everybody just what a great believer you are and how good you are it's like well that's
[01:13:01] what you're doing you're not trying to get your act together that's something you do in private at home
[01:13:06] you think okay what kind of moron am I and what stupid things am I doing and then what could I
[01:13:11] possibly do to get rid of one of those a little bit now well anybody can do that and that's associated
[01:13:18] with these great evils you know in this way that we've already described it's like you're
[01:13:23] constraining you're improving your character and you're constraining the kinds of actions and
[01:13:28] perceptions that you have that are going to make you sick of life and work against it because
[01:13:32] failure does that that's the cane story it's like keeps growing up man see what happens if you think
[01:13:39] that isn't going to make you bitter and if that isn't going to make you vengeful and if that isn't
[01:13:43] going to make you work to hurt people around you or at least not to help them which is the same thing
[01:13:49] then you're just not paying attention everyone knows that's true so well that's responsibility
[01:13:56] right and then so you take on this great task of putting yourself together it gives your life meaning
[01:14:01] and that also helps you be brought just against the fact that there's lots of suffering in life
[01:14:05] and there's lots of malevolence it's like yeah true man absolutely it's worse than you think
[01:14:10] even but you can do more about it than you think and there's nothing in it except good but you also
[01:14:18] have to take responsibility so that's the thing you got to decide if that's what you're going to do
[01:14:24] but you don't get to why and about it if you don't because you haven't tested it so people don't even
[01:14:29] have to look for some grand goal in the sky some elevated goal of what they're going to do
[01:14:36] whether it's a financial goal whether it's a a a a non-profit goal and they're going to they
[01:14:42] could look around their bedroom and figure out what they're going to do right now well to improve
[01:14:47] things one of the things I learned from reading social nets and this he talked about his moral
[01:14:51] transformation in the camps and he said the first thing that transformed him to some degree was
[01:14:57] looking at people in the camps who did refuse to do immoral things no matter what he said he
[01:15:03] ran into people like that and that just blew him away because you already laid that out it's like
[01:15:08] these are he said they were continually choosing between their life and their conscience
[01:15:12] and they chose their conscience like and and he tells some amazing stories in the Google
[01:15:17] I like our capital about dozens of people he meant like that met like that and they're just
[01:15:22] there's stories that of heroism moral heroism under absolutely vicious conditions there
[01:15:30] he just can't believe them you know so so that's pretty amazing but he said that once he kind of
[01:15:35] figured out that there was a difference between attending to your conscience and doing whatever
[01:15:40] was necessary to prolong your miserable existence that he started to think about that deeply and
[01:15:45] that he went over his life with a fine tooth comb and tried to figure out everything he did that
[01:15:50] he knew was wrong and then to try to figure out what he could do in the present to rectify that
[01:15:57] you know you wouldn't necessarily be able to to a tone that's the right that's the right way of
[01:16:02] thinking about it you know you you do something wrong and well maybe you can't even fix it with the
[01:16:07] person you did the wrong too but maybe there's something else you could do that would be good enough
[01:16:10] so that you know you can think okay well at least those balance out and maybe I'm a little bit
[01:16:16] on the side of the positive so he did that you know and that he said that straight in the
[01:16:20] mode a lot and then he wrote this book this amazing book that you know cut the communist
[01:16:26] intellectuals off at their knees and and changed the world really and that's a hell of a thing
[01:16:32] for someone to do who's a you know miserable zack in a in a concentration camp that's a hell of
[01:16:38] a story man and it's not the only one like it so you don't know how much power you have where you
[01:16:43] stand even if you look weak and and if what's around you is terrible well then you got lots of
[01:16:49] things to do that's for sure and they're announcing themselves right there so and well and it's
[01:16:57] tying it in with evil and suffering that is best for me because it's so real you know it's like
[01:17:03] you can be skeptical about the existence of the good but if you if you open your eyes and you do
[01:17:09] any amount of studying and even any amount of self-examination you can't be skeptical about the
[01:17:14] existence of evil I don't believe that you can there are things that read about unit 731 and then
[01:17:20] see how skeptical you are about evil I wouldn't recommend that by the way because that's that is
[01:17:25] so horrible that you can't really read it without being traumatized it is unbelievably horrible you read
[01:17:31] that and then you say well morality is relative it's like see if you can monitor those words after
[01:17:37] reading that and then if morality isn't relative and they're easy for them then there is good
[01:17:42] it's at least whatever reason evil right you can whatever doesn't cause that is good it's sort of
[01:17:48] defining it by it's opposite but that's okay it doesn't matter it's good enough and so how do
[01:17:53] how do guys going back to the the PTSD conversation a little bit how do guys that sort of
[01:18:02] experienced this evil part of not only of the world but of themselves because they had to do some
[01:18:08] things that they didn't want to or they didn't like doing and things that made them feel like um
[01:18:13] there's a dark part of me that I don't really like too much what's the what's the you know from
[01:18:19] what I've said is you got embraced that the fact that there's darkness in the world and that there's
[01:18:24] darkness in you you got to embrace that and get a hold of it not trying to disguise it not trying
[01:18:30] make it seem like it's not there that's the same thing you're saying right yeah well you know when
[01:18:35] you're in really they say there's no atheists and foxholes you know and that's you know it's a bit
[01:18:41] of a cliche but but there's a there's a deep truth in that which isn't there's some circumstances
[01:18:46] that you find yourself in for which only religious language works and if you happen to do
[01:18:52] observe yourself doing something that's highness enough to damage you psychologically then you're
[01:18:58] in the realm of good and evil archetypal good and evil and and unless you can start to conceptualize
[01:19:04] the world in that manner you're never going to make sense out of it and so partly it de-personalizes it
[01:19:10] you know it's it's you that did this but it's like the capacity for evil isn't just you it's
[01:19:20] it's part of humanity maybe it's part of the structure of the cosmos and you happen to stumble over
[01:19:26] it naively and so it hurt you you know there's this only Egyptian story about a god named Horace
[01:19:32] and he's the god of attention so he's represented by the Egyptian eye so he pays attention he's also
[01:19:37] a folk and and folk has great vision and flies above everything right and and he's also the
[01:19:44] the force that revitalizes the dead father in Egyptian mythology but he has a fight with his evil
[01:19:50] uncle set who's a precursor to the idea of Satan and then you can tell by partly because the words
[01:19:56] are quite similar and he has a terrible battle with set who's taken over the kingdom and and his
[01:20:01] terrible tyrant is killing everyone and everything's going to hell and he has a battle with him to
[01:20:07] regain control of his kingdom and that's fine and he's a god and so is Seth and they have a fight
[01:20:14] and it's a terrible fight and during the fight Seth tears out one of his eyes when you think well
[01:20:19] that's a god right and nonetheless he ends up with his vision damaged his consciousness damage now
[01:20:25] he gains a different kind of sight he gains insight right because now he knows the nature of evil
[01:20:31] but he pays a big price for it and so you think well if that's the case for a god how much more
[01:20:37] is it the case for a man to be damaged it's like absolutely right it's no joke to encounter
[01:20:42] malevolence and I've seen that in my clinical clients to I had a client who was terrified into
[01:20:48] nightly convulsions for four years by the look on her boyfriend's face when he attacked her it took
[01:20:54] me a long time down the pack that it was like a three-month process but it was the it was
[01:20:59] she she was very naive very very very naive because her parents had raised her in a world where
[01:21:05] the evil queen was not allowed to visit like the parents and sleeping beauty so she was way too
[01:21:10] sheltered and she thought that human beings were only good you know and then she saw the look
[01:21:18] on his face that indicated that he was out to consciously harm her and he he couldn't they had
[01:21:24] a fight a physical fight and she was strong enough to prevail he wasn't that big but that wasn't
[01:21:30] the point it shattered her world because she didn't understand until that point that someone could
[01:21:35] actually consciously want to hurt you you know that that wasn't just they weren't just in a bad
[01:21:40] mood and it wasn't just because of the way they were raised and you know all those excuses that
[01:21:44] people come up that he was not only going to hurt her but he was going to enjoy it and if you
[01:21:49] don't understand the part of you that's capable of that then well you're you're dangerously
[01:21:57] dangerously naive and dangerous as well because you don't know what you're capable of so
[01:22:04] a lot of these things that you bring up are about leadership and and you know I talk about
[01:22:12] leadership all the time and one of the things that you know I heard you say and you've talked
[01:22:20] about with chimpanzees and other hierarchies that are out there including lobsters which I know
[01:22:27] you like quite a bit and you know even lobsters have a dominant hierarchy which is which is
[01:22:34] definitely incredible since how big is their brain oh it's not like it's mostly distributed through
[01:22:39] their bodies I mean it's not that big and yeah it is absolutely unbelievable to know that the
[01:22:45] hierarchical arrangement like it's a the reason it's a symbolic reality so that would be the great
[01:22:52] father let's say the reason that's a symbolic reality is because you can't see a hierarchy like if you
[01:22:57] look at the world you don't see a hierarchy but chimps know exactly where each chimps is in the hierarchy
[01:23:03] so for example a low ranking mature chimps won't attack a high ranking juvenile even though he could
[01:23:13] tear him apart because he knows that that juvenile is actually an illusion the juvenile is the
[01:23:20] juvenile plus all the other chimps that will come to his rescue right so he can't perceive the hierarchy
[01:23:27] with his eyes but he can perceive the hierarchy with his emotions okay so that hierarchy is essentially
[01:23:33] eternal it's at least 350 million years old and it's and we perceive that all the time we look at
[01:23:39] hierarchical posturing we look at we and we live in hierarchies of competence mostly so that's that's
[01:23:47] that's a universal truth and the fact that you have to struggle with the fact of the hierarchy is
[01:23:52] also universal truth you actually see this being played out to some degree in the leftist feminist
[01:23:57] arena because really what's happening is they they look at the hierarchy let's say the male
[01:24:03] hierarchy they don't attribute it to it competence they attribute to it power and they make the
[01:24:13] pre-supposition that you get to the top by being the meanest most exploitive creature possible
[01:24:19] and so these are often damaged women who've never had a good relationship with man with a man
[01:24:24] and who can't distinguish between competence and power there's a big difference because
[01:24:30] hierarchy that's only based on power is a tyranny but a hierarchy based on competence is something
[01:24:35] that gets things done like that's exactly what you want in a hierarchies that the competent people
[01:24:40] claim the hierarchy so you can tell who's competent at the top and you you made reference to the
[01:24:46] chimpanzee work I mean friends to wall has showed quite clearly that unstable chimped power hierarchies
[01:24:54] are based on tyranny so it is that the ugliest meanest brute of the chimped gets to the top but
[01:25:01] like as soon as he has a bad day then two three quarter as strong chimped terror into pieces
[01:25:07] and the chimps that managed to maintain power at the top or let's say authority because that's a
[01:25:12] better word because we got to get our words right that's a chimped that has friends and that engages
[01:25:18] in reciprocal grooming and that pays reasonable attention to the females and so it's so interesting
[01:25:23] to see that because it shows that even at that level of biological organization there's already
[01:25:28] a morality of leadership yeah and that what where that strikes me is so interesting and I try to
[01:25:33] explain this to people all the time because well in the seal teams again you you might think the same
[01:25:39] thing well the biggest toughest seal that can destroy everyone else is going to be the leader
[01:25:46] that everyone looks to and it's just not true and in fact a lot of times those guys that might
[01:25:52] be the biggest and the strongest and the fastest they're they're actually arrogant as well
[01:25:57] because they think they can beat everyone and no one wants to work for those people and so
[01:26:03] it happened when I first started my consulting business and and I would have you know a CEO say
[01:26:09] I can't wait till you come in and just whip my people into shape and I'd say well you need to
[01:26:14] find somebody else it's going to wet people into shape because I don't do that and they couldn't
[01:26:20] quite put together that me would it wasn't into whipping people into shape and what I wanted to actually
[01:26:26] do is teach people to lead and to lead people myself and when you're leading you're not having to
[01:26:31] whip people the in fact that's an indication that you're not leading exactly that with as a leader
[01:26:37] where I the the place where I usually found myself was I'm actually having to pull the rain
[01:26:41] back on people because they're they're going a far and away above what I actually would even want
[01:26:47] and expect them to do they want to go even more and do more to accomplish the mission and that's
[01:26:51] where you want to get and I find it interesting that you know you talk about that all the time that
[01:26:56] it's that it's not the person with the biggest club it's not the person that's the meanest and the
[01:27:02] most aggressive sure they might they might rise for a minute they might get some control and that
[01:27:07] happens in any organization oh if you've got a CEO that really he's just a tyrant and everyone's
[01:27:11] scared of him he can make some things happen for a little while and then all of a sudden someone says
[01:27:17] I'm oh he wants us to do it that way I'm going to do a little sabotage right just a little sabotage
[01:27:22] your project that you want us to get done by October 31st got delayed boss and you can go
[01:27:28] nuts and you can yell and scream but you should listen to me when I said we needed more time
[01:27:32] and now guess where we're y'all yeah we didn't deliver the product we were supposed to deliver
[01:27:35] so you can yell and scream all you want it's not going to get that product delivered yeah well
[01:27:39] and if you tear nice people badly enough they'll actually hurt themselves to hurt you so you know
[01:27:44] they're willing to take a they're willing to take a hit to to reclaim justice let's say so yeah
[01:27:50] that's really worth knowing and so one of the things that John P. J. pointed out and because he was
[01:27:56] he's a very interesting psychologist day and and he's never taught properly because you know
[01:28:01] most of these great thinkers were very strange people and the strangeness gets added out of their
[01:28:07] stories and it's really too bad because they're way more interesting when you know how strange they
[01:28:11] were and so P. J. was obsessed with the disjunction between religion and science and his goal as a
[01:28:19] thinker was to reconcile the two and so to some degree he was looking for a biological basis of
[01:28:24] morality that might be one way of thinking about it at least a reconcile the idea of a biological
[01:28:29] substrate with an emergent morality and one of the things he said is okay imagine two systems
[01:28:34] all right so both systems are moving towards a goal any old arbitrary goal and in one system
[01:28:42] the the people within it are acting under compulsion and in the other system the people within it
[01:28:48] are acting voluntarily said the people who are acting voluntarily will defeat the people
[01:28:53] acting under compulsion because in order to use compulsion you have to spend a fair bit of time
[01:29:00] and energy on force and so it makes you inefficient whereas if everybody is together on the project
[01:29:06] then they'll you don't have to spend any time on compulsion because people are compelling themselves
[01:29:13] and so that's what he called an equilibrated state so an equilibrated state was well we sit down
[01:29:18] and we have a negotiation it's a real negotiation so it has to be honest and we say okay well
[01:29:24] what the hell are we doing and everyone has to shout out and we decide what we're doing and then we
[01:29:30] decide how that would be good for all of us but each of us singularly as well so if you got your
[01:29:36] family put together properly then the whole family moves together but everybody inside moves ahead
[01:29:41] as well and so then everybody's pushing in the same you know you know how it is within a negotiation
[01:29:46] you actually want your interests to align with the interests of the other person because then you
[01:29:51] don't have to worry about the integrity of the deal it's like everybody has reasons to keep it
[01:29:57] to keep it thriving and the idea that capitalism in somehow is somehow is predicated on the tyranny
[01:30:04] of the people at the at the pinnacle that happens when it gets corrupt but it doesn't happen at all
[01:30:09] when it's working properly because deals that aren't based on mutual self-interest and group
[01:30:16] interests simultaneously have to be enforced usually with lawyers and then you're done right you're
[01:30:21] done at that point that's that's actually incredible so I would when I work with companies
[01:30:27] I've been working with a company is there a couple of years ago maybe even three or four years ago
[01:30:31] and you know they were talking about how they needed to hold their sales people accountable
[01:30:35] and that's what they needed to do and they needed more accountability and the sales leadership
[01:30:38] underneath them need to hold all their frontline sales leaders accountable for everything and
[01:30:42] follow these rules and make these numbers of calls and do these follow up things and send the
[01:30:45] follow up emails and they need to get this accountability thing going and this was the when when I
[01:30:51] heard this guy saying this was the first time I said because I heard this a lot this word
[01:30:55] accountability and leadership you hear oh well we just need better accountability better accountability
[01:30:58] and it's a trick because you think about it and you say to yourself well if I'm in charge of
[01:31:04] you guys and I'm gonna hold you accountable to make sure you do everything you're supposed to do
[01:31:08] well then we will successfully do what it is you will do because I held you accountable I made you do it
[01:31:13] the problem is in any organization there's too many people to hold everyone accountable to
[01:31:18] everything that they're supposed to be doing so it just doesn't work and so you could take one
[01:31:22] group and this is what I said if you got one group or you have to hold them accountable for each
[01:31:25] and everything that you do and you and you try and do that versus a group where people know what
[01:31:29] they're supposed to do and they want to go and do it I go which which team is gonna win and he said
[01:31:34] well a group that wants to do themselves I go that's what you need to do is get them to
[01:31:36] one do themselves leadership well exactly well exactly well that's exactly right I mean look
[01:31:42] if you get people to track everything they do it takes them longer to track and then to do it
[01:31:47] plus they hate it they hate it because they're not being trusted and it's the most terrible
[01:31:52] dull administrative work and it just kills people who are actually productive because
[01:31:56] they're driven crazy by that it's like leave me the hell alone so I can do my work you know
[01:32:02] it and so yeah so there's something that here's an interesting little fact that I think is really
[01:32:10] cool I found this out this is from the psychological literature so I've been interested in how to
[01:32:16] increase people's motivation for a long time you know and and there's a nice literature on that
[01:32:22] and part of it was as was created by late late the manlock carry late the manead when lock
[01:32:29] and they're looking at goal setting that's how well they described it as a means to improve
[01:32:35] business productivity and so what they imagine that you have two teams and you get them to set goals
[01:32:42] and one team sets goals for their corporate productivity and another team sets goals for their life
[01:32:49] and then you match them head to head over some period of time and see which one comes of head
[01:32:54] and what happens is that people who set goals for their life beat the people who set goals
[01:32:58] for the company and so that's really and then there's a variety of other literature that support that kind
[01:33:04] of hypothesis but it's it's very very worthwhile thinking that through because what do you want
[01:33:11] if your company is structured properly do you want people in it who have a life right so they're
[01:33:16] aiming at things that they think are valuable because they're just not going to be motivated period
[01:33:20] unless they're aiming at things they think are valuable and then you want their loyalty to the
[01:33:26] company to be nested inside that so they have to see that working there no matter what it is that they're
[01:33:31] doing and you know often jobs are repetitive and dull and difficult and and challenging and all
[01:33:37] of that or you wouldn't be paid to do them right they're not all fun and games but if you can see that
[01:33:44] the less intrinsically interesting things that you're required to do are related in some directly
[01:33:51] intelligible way to goals that you regard as valuable then that tags those activities with this
[01:33:57] dopamine energy kick that we were talking about earlier so you need this hierarchy of values right
[01:34:02] just like here's what I'm doing with my life here's why my job is important to that or maybe
[01:34:07] it isn't and then you have to quit and go find a new job but that's fine but you know because you
[01:34:11] might discover that too and so we started trying to formalize this when at the same time that I
[01:34:19] also realized something that I've never recovered from realizing I think so I teach students usually
[01:34:28] for this class it was third and fourth year students and so this is at the University of Toronto
[01:34:32] they're pretty smart kids it's a hard university to get into and they're pretty disciplined and they're
[01:34:36] actually quite conservative all things considered and I was teaching them about stories and about
[01:34:42] the fact that our life is a story with a goal and a purpose and a beginning point and and
[01:34:47] I was encouraging them to develop their own stories so I had them write an autobiography
[01:34:54] and they really got into that that was quite amazing to identify you know to break their life into
[01:34:59] epochs and then to describe the important episodes in each epoch both positive and negative and
[01:35:05] what they might do to reduce the possibility of the negative in the future and to capitalize on the
[01:35:09] positive which is the purpose of memory by the way and then also to write a plan for the future
[01:35:15] and so we formalized that so the plan is okay first of all you have to get yourself in the right
[01:35:22] mindset and the mindset is you're trying to take care of yourself like you would care for someone
[01:35:30] that you cared for and that's a hard mindset to get into because people like their pets better than
[01:35:35] they like themselves often and then you have to have a vision and so the vision would be well okay
[01:35:42] three to five years down the road if your friendship networks were configured properly what would that
[01:35:47] look like if you were pursuing the career that would be appropriate for you and sustaining for you
[01:35:54] what would that look like how are you going to educate yourself how are you going to take care of
[01:35:58] yourself mentally and physically what do you want for an intimate relationship and how are you going to
[01:36:03] handle temptations like alcohol and drug abuse because they take people down pretty frequently so all
[01:36:08] you have to think about okay what could that be like if you had what you needed not some wild
[01:36:14] fantasy but but realistic and what you needed so that's the first part and then okay now right
[01:36:21] for 20 minutes about what your life could be like three to five years down the road if all of this
[01:36:26] came together and then now do the opposite so imagine all your weaknesses and all the ways that you
[01:36:33] can go down the wrong path and then imagine that gets the upper hand then imagine where you are
[01:36:39] in three to five years so then you get a polarity a it's like not this and yes this so you can
[01:36:46] run away from the things you don't want and you can run towards the things you do want that
[01:36:51] gets your anxiety behind you instead of in front of you right because maybe you're going to
[01:36:56] go do something difficult and you're afraid of it and then you think well if I don't do this I'm
[01:37:01] going to end up there it's like okay that's so terrible that this little terrible is nothing so
[01:37:07] and then in the next part of the exercise you turn that into an implementable plan you know and you
[01:37:11] write about why your life would be better and why your family's life would be better and why your
[01:37:15] communities life would be better so it's like fully articulated and we've tested about
[01:37:20] 10,000 university students with that now in three different locales and we've increased the
[01:37:26] probability that they'll stay in university by about 30% and raise their grade point average
[01:37:30] about the same and it's work best for men who are most who are doing the least well so in
[01:37:39] hauling those were non-western ethnic minority men and they improved their performance enough
[01:37:44] to actually slightly exceed the Dutch national women who are at the top otherwise over two years
[01:37:50] yeah it was unbelievable it just blew us away a psychological intervention to cure what's in
[01:37:55] hypothetically a sociological problem and so and so that that's a good example of how
[01:38:02] and it did what blew me away when I was first considering this as I had all these students 21
[01:38:08] years old and I realized that no one had ever sat them down not even once in their entire career
[01:38:12] in education it said okay who do you want to be like what sort of person is it that you want to be
[01:38:20] not not job it's like character what do you want your life to be like what should it be like
[01:38:25] and what shouldn't it be like and like right about that seriously like your life depends on it
[01:38:30] because it does and and then I thought well that's so weird why in the world isn't our
[01:38:35] education system set up to help people with that because it's like that's kind of obvious you know it's
[01:38:41] like what are you doing and why and then I did some reading partly from John Gattle who's done
[01:38:48] some interesting work looking at the history of the education system and it was a derivation of
[01:38:52] the Prussian education system back in the late 1800s and it was designed to produce obedient
[01:39:00] obedient well it was partly soldiers but it was partly workers I was going to say definitely
[01:39:06] with soldiers because that was the transition when they they had the transition take place at
[01:39:09] that time as well where they moved away from centralized command after they got beat by Napoleon
[01:39:15] and they never they were constantly trying to fight towards that direction where the soldiers
[01:39:20] would not just be obedient because they realized that that is not what they actually wanted
[01:39:25] they totally they finally started to do at the end of World War one and if they would have
[01:39:30] done it earlier it might have turned the tide of the war but that was what you know that's what
[01:39:34] World War II the Blitzkrieg and and total decentralized command and elements just going out
[01:39:40] and making things happen and finding gaps in the defenses and attacking them as opposed to
[01:39:44] you're just going to wait until you told what to do right and that was the German way
[01:39:49] and decentralized command so right yes well competence beats obedience right so you unite people
[01:39:55] under a goal and then you let them act autonomously you got to get them you got to not sell them
[01:40:01] the goal that's not right you know what you have to do is you have to go in and talk to them
[01:40:06] and discover what the goal is of the enterprise and what it is that fires people up and that
[01:40:11] really does work you know in the idea that capitalism is essentially crooked and it's the people
[01:40:17] who are who are pulling the wall over other people's eyes who win it's like well you know now
[01:40:23] and then there's a criminal action and the person gets away with it so to speak although people
[01:40:29] get away with a lot less than they think but most of the time within a functional company
[01:40:35] you better have your people on board or they will do exactly what you said they'll do
[01:40:39] they'll spend 80% of their time sabotaging the company yeah and I again something I learned
[01:40:44] for working with a corporate world and it was working with a corporate world where I reflected on
[01:40:48] what I did and and it was talking to a elite a business leader at some point and I said well you
[01:40:55] know your people can understand why they're doing what they're doing and so then he's you know
[01:40:58] absorbs that and says okay that's make sense and so then he gets up in front of his team and he says
[01:41:03] you know well the reason why we're doing this is we want to improve our profitability is a company
[01:41:09] and you know he sat down and we talked afterwards and he said did I did a good job because now
[01:41:13] they understand this oh no actually do you miss it and then I started explaining to them better
[01:41:18] because I learned that what you have to explain there has to be a thread of why that goes all the way
[01:41:25] through the corporate reason but that why has to come back down to the individual contributor so they
[01:41:31] realize that when when we do better as a company when we're more profitable as a company we can
[01:41:37] put more money in our in marketing and we can produce stuff cheaper because we'll do it on a
[01:41:42] more masculine and we can lower prices and then we can actually hire more people and that's
[01:41:46] going to make you move up in this command here and you're going to make more money we're going to
[01:41:49] sell more stuff and you're going to get a bigger bonus so you doing this the reason why you're doing
[01:41:53] it is because then you can achieve those levels because you want to buy that house and that car
[01:41:57] and send your kid to school so there's a big difference you need to make sure that the people
[01:42:01] understand why they're doing it not for the corporate reason not for the mission reason but for
[01:42:05] for why it's going to help them the exact same thing you just said for science also really helpful too
[01:42:10] if you know your corporation has a hate to use the word vision because that's you know
[01:42:15] turned into a buzzword but you know it's often that you're working in a company where
[01:42:20] worthwhile things are happening exciting and worthwhile things you know and you're you're trying to
[01:42:25] well make something better at a lower price let's say and so there's the the heroism let's say
[01:42:32] of producing a product that's going to have a positive impact on the world and you need to know
[01:42:37] how your small actions are tied with that greater goal and then there's this financial self
[01:42:42] interest as well and and the thing is if you don't if you can't tell your workers that story then
[01:42:49] either your company is fundamentally corrupt because that isn't the true story it's like you're
[01:42:54] actually working so that I can rape and pillage the company over the next four years and take
[01:42:59] all the value out of it and run because you know CEOs do that at the time to tie it yes or
[01:43:05] you don't understand how the company works and you can't tell the story which means you're basically
[01:43:09] incompetent so but well you people are not wired up so that they will work without knowing why
[01:43:16] unless you beat them and then if you beat them you don't don't be thinking that that's victory
[01:43:21] no so the temporary victory it's that's also something really good to know about marriage it's like
[01:43:28] you can never win an argument with your wife like you could if you only lived with her for one day
[01:43:32] right it's like I won see you later yes like no no she's there the next day and then she's
[01:43:38] she remembers that she does she does remember that yeah maybe even more than you remember it
[01:43:43] you know and it also might be that she was right and you just out argued her so you know and that's
[01:43:48] something that's really worth knowing too because sometimes you know you'll have an argument with
[01:43:52] well let's say with your wife and she's got something to say and it's not very well articulated
[01:43:57] same could be true for you and so you can just brush it aside but you don't want to brush it aside
[01:44:03] because maybe there's something there and if you don't address it then it's not like it's going to
[01:44:07] go away man it's going to grow so maybe you have to help her formulate her argument which is really
[01:44:13] annoying you know because you want to win you have in this disputes like I want to win it so like well
[01:44:19] you're not winning that game you're winning the game well I think about it as the game of games you
[01:44:24] want to win the set of games that stretch across the line the long war yeah that's right
[01:44:29] because I'm going to wait the long where that little battle is not no matter and in fact I don't
[01:44:33] you should not try and be right if you're right everybody knows it's fine but there's the worst thing
[01:44:38] you do is rub it in and you're right and you're wrong yeah yeah you do that a hundred times and then
[01:44:44] like well you're the you're the winner and she's the loser and then that's great because now you're
[01:44:48] married to a loser I mean you know that's if you do that a hundred thousand times then your
[01:44:54] marriage is over and then and then they'll be held to pay you can be sure of that I got asked the
[01:45:02] other day um what is the biggest problem in America and I thought about I hadn't been asked that
[01:45:10] question lately I've been getting some good questions a lot of times like you I get the same question
[01:45:14] over and over and over again but I guess I asked what's the biggest problem in America and I thought
[01:45:18] about it for a second and this may or may not be right but I thought it was at least thought provoking
[01:45:24] I said that the biggest problem that we have in America is that we don't have any big problems
[01:45:34] and if you look at us in World War II during the depression during times where we've got major
[01:45:41] problems the country kind of unifies and it gets behind itself and joins together and you know
[01:45:51] I talked about you know that we we we live in a bubble here I kind of opened up with that as well
[01:45:57] and and that's good like I want there to be a bubble just like I want my family to live in a bubble
[01:46:03] and I almost want I almost want my daughter to really really think it's a real problem
[01:46:12] that there's not a strong Wi-Fi signal in her bedroom and so sometimes it takes longer to die
[01:46:17] I've kind of succeeded as a dad if that's her problem she sees that as a problem that you know
[01:46:25] it takes a little extra there's a there's a longer buffering time on some of her Netflix right
[01:46:30] I've done a good job if that's a problem because you know God can only imagine what kind of
[01:46:35] problems people really have but sometimes I feel like in America and really in the West as a whole
[01:46:43] the problem is is that we don't have any major problems so now it's the Wi-Fi in our bedroom that we're
[01:46:49] getting crazy about and and and wanting to lash out about and I guess my point here is that do we
[01:46:57] eat as individuals do we need struggle there to keep us focused on the right things and as a
[01:47:06] country or as a culture do we need to have some level of struggle before we start looking at
[01:47:13] things that don't matter and turning them into things that we perceive as actually matter
[01:47:18] yeah well you know a couple of things about that carecogard wrote about that back in the late
[01:47:23] 1850s their boats and he said there will come a time when the best thing that you could do for
[01:47:30] people would be to make things more difficult right and that's a thing because everyone's working
[01:47:34] so hard on making things easier there will be no come a time when when there's a felt sense for
[01:47:38] difficulty and I think we're at that point now and I think that's why this message of responsibility
[01:47:43] and truth is echoing so nicely among particularly among young men because every time I talk about
[01:47:50] that in my public talks the room goes silent and that's really interesting and you know people are dead
[01:47:55] focused on it and so like enough rights and freedom it's like truth and respect time for truth and
[01:48:01] responsibility and there's something noble about that and we haven't been able to talk about
[01:48:05] nobility for God only knows how long you know so I do think that's the case and I think it's a
[01:48:11] and William James said that what we need is a moral equivalent to war so something that's
[01:48:19] as serious but that is hopefully not as destructive and so I really like that idea as well and so
[01:48:26] but I think that we are at that point if people would open their eyes a little bit because we have
[01:48:31] this unbelievable culture this technological culture that does provide the degree of protection
[01:48:37] that you described that's an ongoing miracle right it's absolutely unbelievable that any of this
[01:48:44] works at all and it could easily not work and if it didn't work there would be hell to pay and
[01:48:52] and to keep it working and to keep it moving forward especially with what's going to come over
[01:48:56] the next 10 years with with with with artificial intelligence and the sorts of things that were
[01:49:01] we're learning and inventing we better have our acts together and so I think that you can get that
[01:49:08] war like sense if you start to if you start to understand that you can take on your life like that
[01:49:15] that's also why I think it's so necessary to see the world as a battleground in some sense
[01:49:19] between good and evil but you don't put the evil outside like some of its outside obviously but that's
[01:49:24] not your initial concern your initial concern is to get your act together right to take on the burden of
[01:49:30] being to bear the suffering like you said you found that when you went out into combat that you know
[01:49:36] you might have been wary of death which is perfectly reasonable but that you weren't afraid of it
[01:49:42] to the point where it would paralyze you well that's a useful thing to know you know because it
[01:49:47] means that you're different than you thought you were you know because people are afraid of suffering
[01:49:51] in death and especially if they've been completely and constantly sheltered from it but you can
[01:49:57] discover and lots of people do that if they actually confront it that they can tolerate it far better
[01:50:02] than they thought I mean think about all the people who work in like palliative care awards
[01:50:06] you know or infunial parlors for that matter like they're confronting death on an ongoing basis
[01:50:11] and yet every day they go to work so people are tough and so I think there is a responsibility that
[01:50:19] everybody can take up and I think the responsibility is something like well we need to decide if we're
[01:50:24] going to collectively and individually tilt the world towards heaven or tilt it towards hell we saw
[01:50:30] what hell was like in the 20th century I could be back at our doorstep at no time flat we should have
[01:50:36] learned that and it's necessary for people to understand the relationship between their individual
[01:50:41] actions and the direction of culture as a whole you know look at that guy in charlots fill
[01:50:47] you know that was one guy and he probably increased polarization in the United States by like 5%
[01:50:54] or something you know it doesn't take very many individual actions of that pathological
[01:50:59] sort to tip things in a very terrible direction so I mean one of the things I've been telling
[01:51:05] the people who've been watching my videos and in the live conversations is that you have to take
[01:51:12] yourself seriously you have to know that you're a monster and that you're capable of terrible
[01:51:18] things and that it's and that you have a responsibility to understand that to incorporate it to
[01:51:24] constrain it and to discipline it and then to work for the alleviation of suffering and the
[01:51:30] constraint of malevolence and if you understand that then it can turn your life into
[01:51:35] a noble enterprise and then you have some self respect which beats the hell out of self
[01:51:42] esteem in my estimation so and I don't think that that's a difficult message for people to
[01:51:48] understand I think they know that at a fundamental level and I think at the moment they're
[01:51:51] starving to death for it the subordinate principle so the the thing
[01:52:00] when you talk about this elevated state this elevated thing I think I've figured out
[01:52:10] that what you're talking about is essentially truth that is that to you sort of the what we need
[01:52:18] to do is deal in truth on a daily basis in our own lives and in the lives with people around us
[01:52:26] well I think it's two things like in sort of classical Christian morality and I bring it up because
[01:52:32] it's sort of at this sub structure of Western ethics there's two things there's truth and love
[01:52:39] and and you know both of those words are even hard to say because they'd be mouth to death
[01:52:44] but but they have in some sense they have a deep technical meaning and if you know that then
[01:52:49] it kind of re-ignites their power and love is the decision that being is worthwhile and should
[01:52:55] and that you should struggle to support and improve it and that's not a trivial thing because
[01:53:01] being is right with suffering and I everyone dies everyone gets sick like it's it's brutal it's
[01:53:07] brutal and it's easy to turn against it and so the idea that you're going to voluntarily accept
[01:53:14] responsibility for that assume that it's good or act as if it's good and try to improve it is
[01:53:19] no trivial matter and that means you have to scow her out the resentment and the arrogance and the
[01:53:25] deceit and primarily and and it's sort of based on this idea I would say is like well life is
[01:53:33] very hard obviously but we're not doing everything we could to make it better and we're often
[01:53:40] doing things to make it worse so even if it is suffering which is true we have no idea how much we
[01:53:47] could immediately rate that if we all put our efforts into it and so that's a genuine question it's
[01:53:53] like yeah there's reasons to shake your fist and curse God I mean everyone ends up in a situation
[01:53:58] like that someone they love gets a terrible illness and disintegrates before their eyes you know
[01:54:02] and maybe they're a really good person and they've done nothing you would think of to deserve that
[01:54:07] and you know that terrible fate is visited upon them it's very difficult not to get cynical and
[01:54:12] angry under such circumstances but then while that takes you down a very bad road if you
[01:54:17] do that but it doesn't it doesn't it doesn't change the fundamental question it's like
[01:54:23] if your life isn't everything you think it should be you have to ask yourself if you're doing
[01:54:28] everything you can because you actually don't get to make a judgment about the structure of being
[01:54:33] until you do everything you can and I would say that's love essentially that's the decision
[01:54:38] and then truth is the best the best strategy with regards to that attainment and how how could
[01:54:46] it be otherwise like if you're gonna contend with reality you bloody well better know what it is
[01:54:52] you know and truth isn't your grandmothers you know your your your your two tight-laced grandmothers
[01:54:59] moral finger wagging it's like the truth of existence is brutal and bitter and so to be able to face
[01:55:07] that and and to admit to the things that you are and to and to communicate them with other people
[01:55:14] especially in an intimate relationship it's like that's that's no cowardly morality that's not
[01:55:22] the morality of cowardice quite the contrary you know Nietzsche said you could assess the spirit of
[01:55:27] a man by determining how much truth he could tolerate it's like that's that's the right that's the
[01:55:32] right way of thinking about truth well you open this whole podcast with some truth
[01:55:37] it's like who wants to hear that you know and people think oh that's so terrible and they don't
[01:55:43] think well could I be one of those ISIS guys it's like I can tell you if you're bitter enough
[01:55:48] especially if you hate women you know because they've rejected you because you're such a you
[01:55:52] so goddamn useless that no woman in the right mind would look at you twice you know that'll
[01:55:57] generate plenty of bitterness in your soul and if you don't think that you could act like that
[01:56:01] under those conditions then you're not even watching your own fantasies so
[01:56:07] truth in the service of the betterment of being it's something like that and that's
[01:56:15] that's enough to give your life meaning I don't care where you start like I had this kid come and
[01:56:19] visit me a well back and he had never left his home state and he was I think he was 19 and he was
[01:56:27] overprotected and over sheltered and he was a smart kid and so of course he also thought that the
[01:56:31] world really hadn't appreciated his gifts which is a very common feeling for smart kids who
[01:56:39] who aren't getting anywhere right they get really angry about that and then he decided that he was
[01:56:44] going to move out of his house and he took a job as a dishwasher and he said he tried to do a good
[01:56:49] job as a dishwasher it's like good that's some humility it's just a dishwasher job but you know
[01:56:54] you can be a good dishwasher and then the restaurant runs better and then it's kind of fun
[01:57:00] as long as the people you're working with or half decent you can make good social relationships and
[01:57:04] then you can learn to be social which was happening to him and then maybe they let you be a shorter
[01:57:09] order cook you know and and you got a bit of a clue and then you have a bit of money and you have
[01:57:13] a little independence and it's a lot better than being at home and being better and resentful
[01:57:18] and immature you know it's just a dishwasher in job well that's the wrong way of thinking about it it's
[01:57:23] like it's it's the first door that's open to you you know and then he came up to Toronto he
[01:57:30] he'd never been out of this home state so it was a big deal for him to come to another city
[01:57:34] and when he first came to talk to me it was outside of one of my lectures he couldn't even speak
[01:57:38] he was so nervous because he had pretty high levels of social anxiety so it was tongue tied
[01:57:43] and I invited him to come over to my house to talk to him because I knew there was something
[01:57:46] up with him and he told me this story you know and I thought well you know that's the beginnings
[01:57:51] of a heroic journey he was able to humble himself enough so that you know if you're low if you're
[01:57:57] in a low place it's a low door that's going to open and you might think I'm too high to crawl
[01:58:03] through that low door young said Carl young said people modern people don't see God because they
[01:58:09] don't look low enough I really like that idea but that's it if you're in a low place
[01:58:14] the opportunity that presents itself to use going to be low and it's going to be very tempting
[01:58:19] to you because your arrogant resentful to say well that's not good enough for me it's like
[01:58:24] well do you have an alternative if you don't have an alternative then an in-shop is up
[01:58:32] and it's the right trajectory you know and so that's humility that's humility it's like
[01:58:37] you're low you take what you take what's given to you and you see if you can make it work and the
[01:58:44] thing is that works way faster than people think even because I worked as a dishwasher when I was a kid you
[01:58:49] know for a year or so and it was really hard to begin with because I didn't know what I was doing
[01:58:54] in the German chef who's kind of a tough guy just let me flounder around for two weeks to see if I
[01:58:59] would quit so I was there to like three in the morning and I was 13 I think I couldn't wash all these
[01:59:04] damn dishes I thought it was impossible I told my dad at one point I said I don't know if I can
[01:59:08] do this it's like I'm working as hard as I can and they keep piling up you know but I didn't
[01:59:13] stop and then the German cook you know who had been treating me pretty hard she had one day he said okay
[01:59:19] I'll show you how to do this and then he showed me how to organize the dishes and everything it was like
[01:59:25] that was not no problem I could do it like 10% of the time so then I cleaned up the rest of the
[01:59:29] kitchen I had a good time mucking about with the chefs and we played around a lot back there and I
[01:59:34] ended up working as a short order cook and I learned to cook and all of that and that was a good
[01:59:38] part of my adolescence but but the thing is so the thing is is that those trivial jobs
[01:59:46] it's the conception of their triviality that makes them trivial they're not trivial not if you do
[01:59:52] them right and if you're around people of any sense you know sensible people are always looking around
[01:59:57] for other people who can do things right and if they see you trying to do things right the
[02:00:02] probability that they'll open a door for you is virtually 100% because it's kind of rare you know so
[02:00:09] they're going to be skeptical to begin with to see you got to prove your metal let's say but as soon
[02:00:14] as you do they'll think okay well we'll give this kid a little bit more opportunity to see what happens
[02:00:20] and you know to not think that's how the world works is to be extraordinarily cynical because that is how
[02:00:24] it works in a functioning society yeah I mean I work with businesses all the time and there is
[02:00:31] they they anybody that is just above normal competency in anything even that's going to try
[02:00:37] anyone that's going to put effort in they they love those people and those people are going to do
[02:00:41] well and you're absolutely right that doors are absolutely going to open for them if they
[02:00:46] do what they're trying to do to the best of their ability and do a competent job at it
[02:00:50] well the other thing that's interesting is what happens to people who aren't trying
[02:00:54] because what happens to them is like they're in a place where there's a thousand doors in front
[02:01:00] of them that are invisible they don't know the doors are there and they could either be opened or
[02:01:05] closed and so if they're one of these people who is going above and beyond the Call of Duty
[02:01:10] unless the organization is entirely corrupt right and that happens sometimes then there are people who
[02:01:15] are watching and they'll start to open these invisible doors and then all of a sudden the person
[02:01:19] has opportunities in front of them and they don't even know why some of the time right because someone
[02:01:24] said you know give a positive word to someone else and said you all you could take a look at this
[02:01:29] kid and so these doors open and then the people who are in there grudgingly and bitterly it's like
[02:01:37] people watch that and they're the people who are the gatekeepers and they just close the doors
[02:01:42] and then the person looks up and there's nothing in front of them there's no open doors at all
[02:01:46] and then then they curse God you know for making such a miserable cosmos it's like no you just
[02:01:52] don't understand what you just don't understand what happened is like the fruits of your bitterness
[02:01:58] how do you your bitterness manifested fruit you don't even know it you've delimited your options
[02:02:07] in a terrible way and you've closed you know you're you're you're walking down you're walking
[02:02:12] between cliff walls and they're getting closer and closer and closer together and then you'll be
[02:02:16] stuck and you'll think how they held it this happened and it happened because you didn't
[02:02:23] you didn't avail yourself of the opportunities that presented themselves to you so you know that's
[02:02:34] horrible but that's that's how it is I did ask a quite often you know this guy got promoted and I
[02:02:41] should have gotten promoted what should I do now or this person isn't carrying their load and
[02:02:46] and they they think I should do their work what should I do now and you know the answer is yeah
[02:02:51] someone wants you to do their work do they want to do that all day long yeah you you you
[02:02:57] you don't want to do your job that's fine and actually I got I just answered a question
[02:03:01] where somebody said to the guys the friend of mine and he's not carrying his load what should I do
[02:03:06] and I said well how about you help him what's going on at home is he going through a divorce
[02:03:11] he got issues kid sick how about you help him and say hey let me let me take that off your plate
[02:03:15] right now because it two months or six months you might be the person that needs help you might
[02:03:19] be the person with a set child but regardless that maybe he just is lazy and maybe he shouldn't be
[02:03:25] your friend and maybe eventually you won't be your friend but nonetheless the solution is the same
[02:03:29] if you don't want to do your work that's fine I'll do it for you that's that's such a funny thing
[02:03:32] that's exactly right because you know what you want to do and in your job is make yourself
[02:03:37] indispensable right in the way you make yourself indispensable is by being indispensable
[02:03:43] and the way you do that is by doing a bunch of things that if they're not done catastrophe occurs
[02:03:48] and that's exactly right so if there's someone around you and they're abdicating your
[02:03:53] responsibility and you can pick it up it's like what an opportunity you know it's you think well
[02:03:58] I'm not going to get credit for it it's like well first of all there's lots of different forms of
[02:04:02] credit but you learn and then when the company shrinks and they're looking at who to keep you know
[02:04:09] they think oh well turns out you're doing all sorts of so we can't do without you that's
[02:04:13] not what we expected we can't do without you here's some more things you could do you know and then
[02:04:18] you're also in a position to bargain you can say well look you know in order for me to keep doing
[02:04:24] this level of responsibility you know I need to be paid more because I have other options
[02:04:30] or because it's just or because that will make me more efficient but then you've got some power
[02:04:36] too because they need you and so indispensable that's power indispensable is power not tyranny
[02:04:43] so now obviously we started off talking about some very negative stuff with with ISIS and
[02:04:52] and you've touched on this a little bit already but I want to make sure we hit this hard enough
[02:04:59] and that is for people to to live a better life to live a life that they're proud of to live a
[02:05:07] life that they that that when they die they don't regret the life that they lived and for me I mean
[02:05:13] I I tell people this clinical freedom that the hard work the doing the right thing you know I tell
[02:05:21] people to write down what you're supposed to do the next day before you go to bed and then you wake
[02:05:25] up and do the things that you're supposed to do the things that you're supposed to do the things
[02:05:30] that you actually know are going to make you healthier and faster and smarter and stronger
[02:05:37] and and make you more money and and move you forward and help you're feeling you just write those things
[02:05:42] down and then you go do them and and that's essentially you've drawn that out on a large scale
[02:05:50] with and you've described this somewhat with the experiment that you did with with people writing
[02:05:55] down what they're supposed to do not just tomorrow but with their life that's the future offering
[02:06:01] program and that's that's really been immensely beneficial for people it certainly seems to have been
[02:06:08] it's at self-authoring.com and we put up a discount code for your for your listeners it's willing
[02:06:19] and so they can get 20% off it and it the system allows you to write an autobiography and
[02:06:25] to analyze your personality flaws and virtues and to write a future plan and you can do all of
[02:06:31] those are one of them but yeah it's it's extremely useful because one of the things you can
[02:06:37] be virtually certain of in life is that you don't get something you don't aim at and one of the
[02:06:42] things that's interesting about that is often people will keep their goals fuzzy because the
[02:06:48] one of the problems with specifying your goals is you specify your failures right if the goal is
[02:06:53] really fuzzy you're not sure when you fail and that then you can fool yourself you know really but
[02:06:57] you can kind of keep it foggy but you make your goal sharp and clear then well first of all then
[02:07:03] you know what to aim at and what's interesting is you know your brain is set up so that it reorganizes
[02:07:09] the world around your aims and that's not I've also written about this in 12 rules for life it
[02:07:14] quite extensively and that's not a metaphor like we don't see much of the world because there's a lot
[02:07:19] of the world and there isn't much of us and so we see what we aim at we aim with our eyes and
[02:07:24] here's an example so a great apes don't really have much of a white in their eyes but human beings do
[02:07:31] and the reason for that is that we've evolved to detect where everyone else is looking and so if I
[02:07:37] can't tell where you're looking I don't know what you're up to and then well over time that means
[02:07:43] I can't read you as well and more and more likely to get in a dispute and wonder or the other
[02:07:47] vices more likely to get killed but it also means that your your probability of finding a successful
[02:07:54] mate decreases so we've evolved to have this very very visually evident eye and so when we're
[02:08:00] looking each other we're always looking at our eyes because then we can tell where someone is pointed
[02:08:06] and then we can tell what they're up to and so we're hunting creatures like we're aiming at a
[02:08:12] moving target and trying to track it all the time and so you have to specify your aim and the
[02:08:17] future authoring program helps people specify the aim and it's it's more than one aim it's like
[02:08:22] you have a highest aim which you might say is to be a good person and then I would say well there's
[02:08:28] there's a more elaborated aim than that it's like you want to be able to constrain malevolence and
[02:08:33] work to decrease suffering it's something like that that's the highest aim and and then and then
[02:08:40] you have to decompose that into the things you do each day so that there's a definite
[02:08:46] connection between all the micro actions and the macro aim and then that gives dignity to what you're
[02:08:50] doing you know so you know if you're at home with your kids what what are you trying to do
[02:08:56] well you're trying to raise them to be the kind of moral agents that will work to constrain the evil
[02:09:01] in the world and to reduce suffering it's like and so that's what you're doing when you're
[02:09:05] changing a diaper if you're doing it carefully and with some respect and some love like it's a major
[02:09:10] league deal to be doing that and God only knows who your kid's going to be you know it could be
[02:09:15] the kid that shoots up Columbine or could be stalland that wouldn't be so good or he could be
[02:09:21] someone or she could be someone who is a positive benefit to the world you know and so every child
[02:09:27] is a whole new realm of of of possibilities and so there's dignity in that if you understand that
[02:09:34] so the future authoring program anyways helps people layout a plan and always suggest to people
[02:09:40] that they do it badly because you're not going to do it perfectly and if you get perfectionistic
[02:09:45] it's going to stop you you know when you first start to plan you're probably only going to be
[02:09:50] about 20% right but zero the difference between zero and 20% is immense and we found with our
[02:09:56] research that even people who only spend an hour on it benefit substantially in their ability to
[02:10:02] stick to what their next plan is you know and you now you mentioned something earlier too just
[02:10:09] just a bit of oh yes about about scheduling yeah so one of the things I tell people so you say
[02:10:16] write down what you're going to do the next day before you go to bed that's good because then you
[02:10:20] you've got a direction set when you wake up in the morning okay so but I've told people to learn to
[02:10:25] use a schedule and people often hate schedules because they act as their own tyrants right they say
[02:10:30] we have to do this unpleasant thing and then here's another unpleasant thing you have to do and
[02:10:35] then you have to do this unpleasant thing and you do that for about three days and you think tell
[02:10:39] this I'm not doing that you know and you fall off the wagon that isn't what you're supposed to
[02:10:44] with a schedule you're supposed to use it to design the days that you would like to have if you were
[02:10:50] taking care of yourself and so some of that is you know you wake up at the morning and you think
[02:10:56] here's five things I have to do that if I don't do my life will be worse it's like paying bills for
[02:11:01] example or or taking out the garbage it's like you have to do those because otherwise things degenerate
[02:11:07] so you gotta put some of those in the schedule because otherwise tomorrow is worse than today and
[02:11:11] that's a bad trajectory but you also want to build in things you know you've got to act in some
[02:11:17] sense like you're dealing with a relatively recalcitrant nine year old it's like so well here's
[02:11:23] some things you have to do but here's some things that if you do you could reward yourself with and
[02:11:28] if you get the balance there between obligation and reward right then you'll find that you're motivated
[02:11:34] to do the things and and that's what you want to do you want to do that so it's sustainable across days
[02:11:38] and weeks and months and so you've got to you've got to treat yourself like a good boss would treat
[02:11:45] a valued employee and not like a tyrant would treat a slave because the slave will rebel and you know
[02:11:51] people say well I I don't follow through on my plans it's like well a they're probably not very
[02:11:57] well formulated and maybe you're doing them because of an external moral obligation or something
[02:12:02] not really your plans right and be you're acting like a tyrant and a slave and that's a bad
[02:12:08] relationship to have with yourself so you you want to treat yourself with some well the same way
[02:12:15] that's the golden rule right it treat yourself as you would treat other people as you would have
[02:12:21] them sorry treat other people as you would like to be treated it works both ways you also treat
[02:12:27] yourself like you treat other people properly so that's a necessary thing and often people don't
[02:12:32] do that but the scheduling is really important actually I when I tell people because when I first
[02:12:39] started talking about this people would start scheduling their day and they would just go you know
[02:12:43] minute by minute everything will be something you can't maintain that for multiple reasons number one
[02:12:47] is no one wants to have a day like that where everything that you do throughout the day minute to
[02:12:52] minute sucks it's things that you don't want to do so guess what after three days you say I'm not
[02:12:57] doing this anymore it's it sucks it's not fun and and so and the same thing with the task list people
[02:13:03] would push those off if they're not on the schedule so yeah it's a put it on the schedule but
[02:13:07] then the thing I ended up telling people is you need to you need to number one schedule empty space in
[02:13:12] there where because things are going to take longer and then you're going to be off schedule and
[02:13:16] then you'll be frustrated so you schedule that things are going to be just empty you're not going
[02:13:19] to do anything for for this hour before lunch you don't schedule anything you're not going to do anything
[02:13:25] you're not going to do anything there and the other thing is you schedule things that you
[02:13:28] actually want to do in there and then you go and execute the things that you want to do you want to
[02:13:32] work out every day you know you should or maybe you maybe if it's something you enjoy then you schedule
[02:13:36] it in there if you enjoy going pick in your kids up from school on Tuesdays and Thursdays because that's
[02:13:41] when they do the running club then you schedule that in there so you can go and do that thing that you
[02:13:44] want to do so you don't just schedule the things that suck you schedule the good things too and
[02:13:49] discipline equals freedom I say this all the time if you want to have more free time which is what
[02:13:53] people want then you need to have more discipline time management you will end up with more free time
[02:13:56] I promise you I promise you you will the other thing I was thinking about and I couldn't I just
[02:14:03] kind of occurred to me now is people always tell people you know come up with a goal and then
[02:14:08] write it down and then you're going to get there and I was you know as you were talking about
[02:14:11] future authoring what you had said earlier when you were describing the program in its infancy what
[02:14:15] became future authoring is I was saying well how do you get people to actually do this well what you
[02:14:21] have embedded in the program is the fear of what happens if you don't do these things and where
[02:14:26] you're going to end up and people forget that people forget where they end up if they don't do
[02:14:31] what they're supposed to do in life and I've explained this to my kids that when you look around
[02:14:36] and you see people that are doing things which are self evidently not desirable things to be doing in
[02:14:43] life whether you're a bomb or whether you're doing a you know I was a dishwasher as well and I have
[02:14:48] an interesting story about that and I'll tell that at some point about a Scottish girl named
[02:14:52] Roslyn she was older than me I was 13 and after you know several weeks of washing dishes and she was like
[02:15:00] maybe 17 or 18 and anyways to make a long story short eventually I said hey do you want to like
[02:15:06] go to a movie or something with me because I'd like to go to a movie with you and she looked at me
[02:15:11] and she said joko you have a serious mental problem so Roslyn I know you're out there somewhere you
[02:15:19] broke my heart sister but I watched it just and that's a good thing for a 13 year old to do but when
[02:15:27] you're 18 okay now it's a little bit you want to have moved up to be the shorter cook and by the time
[02:15:32] you're 25 you want to be in charge of the whole kitchen and by the time you're 30 you want to maybe
[02:15:37] run the night time shift and and that's a good progression and that's good but you don't want to be
[02:15:42] 35 and 44 years old out at the dish washing stage you don't want to be there and I explain to my
[02:15:49] kids because you can see people that are at that stage in their life and sure there's a chance
[02:15:53] that maybe they had some hardship that came along that hit them and it put them in this position
[02:16:00] and now they have to build back up again and they're waiting for those windows of our doors of
[02:16:03] opportunity to open up and that's okay but a lot of times it's because they didn't work they didn't
[02:16:09] make good decisions they didn't do the best job that they could and so they end up in these positions
[02:16:15] that they shouldn't be in and it's and I tell my kids that those are real people that are in
[02:16:21] those positions like we're gonna leave this restaurant and we're gonna go home or we're gonna do
[02:16:27] what we do that guy is gonna be there for five more hours because it's nine o'clock he's got a
[02:16:32] clean everything when they get to he's gonna be there for five more hours then he's got a mop before
[02:16:36] and he already's doing tomorrow the same thing you always doing the night after that the same thing
[02:16:40] that's a real person and I hope it's a 14 year old I hope it's a 16 year old I hope it's even
[02:16:44] an 18 year old but I hope it's not a 48 year old but there are 48 year olds that end up in that
[02:16:49] position and what you do in this program is you you explain that you can end up there and actually
[02:16:56] being a 48 year old this washers actually pretty positive to wear some of you can and
[02:17:00] oh definitely which is addicted to drugs addicted to alcohol or or or whatever well and
[02:17:05] everybody kind of has a sense of where they would end up if they let things
[02:17:09] auger down you know and everybody has their their specific weaknesses that that their
[02:17:16] faults would exploit you know and some people would end up homeless and some people would end up
[02:17:21] with a physical illness or a psychiatric illness and some people would end up addicted and some
[02:17:25] people would end up cruel but everybody kind of knows where they would head because they've seen it
[02:17:30] they've seen it rise up and it's really useful to be terrified of that as if it's a possibility you know
[02:17:36] that's a heaven and hell they're essentially it's like okay well it's not even as if it's a possibility
[02:17:41] it's a possibility absolutely absolutely absolutely yeah yeah well and and all you have to do to
[02:17:46] get there is do nothing I can't just drift there all by yourself so not only is it a possibility
[02:17:52] it's actually rather high possibility and so you have to make that realistic enough
[02:17:57] which means that you have to take an inventory of your weaknesses let's say you have to make
[02:18:02] that realistically enough so you're actually terrified of it because then that's a great motivation
[02:18:07] in my clinical practice people are often faced with tough decisions like well you know
[02:18:13] I'm not happy at my job and I'm afraid to leave it fair enough you know that's a big deal okay
[02:18:22] how afraid are you of not leaving it let's lay that out because you know one of the
[02:18:29] peculiarities of human thought is that you do get used to the devil you know and then you
[02:18:35] you downplay it but it's very often that staying in the same place will do you in
[02:18:42] it's much worse than the risk that you'll take you know and I mean I'm practical with us
[02:18:46] to say look if you're gonna stop your job let's let's have a clue about this right get your
[02:18:51] CV together right start seeing what other options you have because you don't want to just step
[02:18:56] off a cliff that's not helpful um organize yourself so that you've got enough strength to go
[02:19:03] through the process of finding a new job you know you're gonna have to get used to be an
[02:19:06] interview you got to think that through maybe we can practice that so you got to say yourself up
[02:19:10] for it but you really want to think through the cost of the inaction and that's something people
[02:19:15] generally don't do and this is also one of the useful um features of having a tragic view of life
[02:19:21] let's say because most of the time often you're screwed either way but you get to pick which one
[02:19:28] and that's a big deal it's like there's there's risks on both paths and their major risks
[02:19:33] and that's actually freeing because you know well there's trouble both ways so that frees you up
[02:19:39] because if you think well this is the safe path and this is the dangerous path well then you're
[02:19:44] not gonna take the dangerous path but if you think well I've got danger a or danger b and this is where
[02:19:49] I would rather bet my future well that's way better and I've had like many many clients that
[02:19:55] I've helped with their careers and and we do exactly that it's like you know okay what's our goal
[02:20:00] our goal is to triple your salary in four years I think well that's not possible it's like well
[02:20:06] we'll try for doubling but you don't know it's possible you got to let's get it together
[02:20:10] and you're gonna get over being afraid of looking for a job you got to get over being afraid of being
[02:20:14] interviewed you have to put yourself together so that you've you've got options and then you
[02:20:19] got to start to push you don't know you might be able to do it well it's it's it's it's quite surprising
[02:20:26] how frequently that works you know and that assumes the people are trying right they're competent
[02:20:32] you know it's not this isn't waving a magic wand or anything like that and it takes a lot of work
[02:20:37] you know like if you're gonna switch jobs you might have to I figure 50 to one failure to success
[02:20:44] it's something like that and it's useful to know the baselines as well right because looking for a
[02:20:48] job is can be very disheartening unless you know the baselines it's like well yeah 50 50 resumes
[02:20:55] for one interview don't take it personally it's just how it is so it's not that you're us screw up
[02:21:01] it's that there are way more resumes than there are jobs and and that can also and then you know
[02:21:08] don't look for a job for eight hours a day because you only build to do that for three days and then
[02:21:13] you'll die you look for a job an hour a day if you already have one for an hour a day or half an
[02:21:18] hour a day for three months two resumes a day three resumes a day you'll find a job it'll take
[02:21:24] while one of my clients took like three years you know to get her first break but then right after
[02:21:29] that she got another one and then right after that she got another one but she stuck it out and
[02:21:33] you know it was brutal because she had interviews and they didn't go you know they didn't work
[02:21:37] in the job that she didn't like at the time yeah but I also say the people like you know generally
[02:21:42] stay in your job because you're way more likely to get a new job when you have a job
[02:21:46] you know so I always tell people yeah because I get the same exact thing hey I'm in this job it's
[02:21:53] miserable I don't like it I want to leave tomorrow but I don't have the courage and I've said
[02:22:00] actually it's gonna take you more courage to stay in your current job formulate an exit strategy
[02:22:06] save up money start putting together a better resume get some technical skills that you might not
[02:22:11] have right now do all that while you're suffering in this job that you don't like so that when you
[02:22:15] make the transition which will come it'll be the right way and you won't end up like you said jumping
[02:22:21] off of a cliff well it also makes you hopeful even in the terrible job because you know then you've
[02:22:27] got some hope and like hope is a big deal you can you can put up with a lot of misery if you've
[02:22:31] got hope but if you think I'm miserable today and I'm gonna be miserable tomorrow and next year
[02:22:38] I'm gonna be older and just as miserable it's like that's that's not good but if you think well
[02:22:43] I've got a plan you know that's that's a whole different story yeah and it's a good idea for those
[02:22:50] veterans that are out there don't just get out formulate a plan figure out where you're gonna go
[02:22:57] and have that in place and then you get out you step into your lives yeah well I really like to see
[02:23:02] the military use this future authoring program for for people who are decommissioning because
[02:23:07] you need you know your idea that you need the next mission is that that's exactly right you know
[02:23:12] life is like a series of missions forward you know and nested in something greater than that I think but
[02:23:18] you you do you need to have a plan and you know what you got to kind of hold the plan loosely
[02:23:24] you know so because you're gonna make mistakes formulating it but
[02:23:29] the way it works basically is you aim at something in the future and so then you start moving forward
[02:23:35] and as you move forward you accrue more experience and more information sometimes that's through failure
[02:23:41] doesn't matter but you're not staying in the same place so you're actually growing even if you're
[02:23:45] even if you're doing badly if you learn from those mistakes and so then you move towards the goal
[02:23:51] and your perspective shifts and then you might have to modify the goal a bit because now you're
[02:23:55] a little smarter you think well that other goal wasn't helpful it's like yes it was because it moved
[02:24:00] you an inch farther ahead and so you know you you kind of approached the final goal in a zigzag
[02:24:06] manner and the zigz in the zags get less extreme as you get closer to the final goal but you
[02:24:12] have to do a lot of zigzagging to begin with so you got to give yourself that space for error that's
[02:24:17] why there's an archetypal idea that the fool is the precursor to the savior which is a really and
[02:24:24] you see that with comedians yeah comedians are fools and they tell the truth right so so in the
[02:24:28] court gestures the only person who gets to tell the truth and a fool will take a risk as well
[02:24:33] and you need to take risks in order to progress so that's the idea but it also means that
[02:24:38] you have to allow yourself to make the mistakes that are necessary while you progress and not beat
[02:24:43] yourself to death about it and so that's also really helpful because it means that when you're
[02:24:47] formulating your plans you can say well this is the best I can do now subject to revision it's like
[02:24:54] great that's good enough really it's good enough it just has to move you to the next place
[02:24:58] that's interesting because obviously I've done a ton of military planning and I would see guys
[02:25:03] that would get so wrapped around trying to make the perfect plan and it would take them so long to plan
[02:25:08] that by the time they're ready to actually get the plan for the whole target it shifted and things
[02:25:12] had moved and the battlefield changed they're not ready to do this anymore so you need to come up with
[02:25:16] like you said you need to come up with a good idea of what you're going to do and how you're going to
[02:25:20] do it and then you start to move and and as you move you start to see things from a different angle
[02:25:25] and you gain more intelligence and you get another report and all of a sudden the target ships a
[02:25:28] little bit but you're adapting and you're closer to the target anyways very very very good
[02:25:33] yeah well and it is it's also the idea that you're gaining information because you might say well
[02:25:38] I don't know what to do with my life so maybe I should just stay here and figure it out it's like
[02:25:42] no no if you stay there then all you know is what you know well you're there and you don't
[02:25:47] know enough because you can't make a plan so make a bad plan even if even if it's actually
[02:25:53] a plan that works out so that it's opposite of what you want if you move towards that plan you're
[02:26:00] going to know more clearly that it's opposite of what you want and as soon as you know that it's
[02:26:04] opposite you know oh I should be going in the other direction so like that's not that's not a retreat
[02:26:09] that's that's an advance and and the thing is people were active creatures and we're always navigating
[02:26:15] through territory right we can't be sitting in one place and waiting well you can't because you get a
[02:26:22] whole so even if you're sitting in one place the place is changing on you and that's just
[02:26:27] well you said that when you said you know people make a detailed plan and then the environmental
[02:26:31] shift on them and on future offering yeah do you go back in and adjust your goals yeah
[02:26:38] as it's a it's something that you continually update yeah and I would say don't update it too
[02:26:42] often right because then you end up in the situation you were just describing but the idea would
[02:26:47] probably it's something like make your damn plan implemented for four months or six months and then
[02:26:53] go back and see what needs to be updated you know and you'll find that you've done a lot of what
[02:26:59] you said you would and so then it'll need to be reformulated so and and that's also very self
[02:27:07] affirming I suppose is the right it helps you understand that there's more to you than you think
[02:27:13] which is actually the case you know there is more to people than they think that that's one
[02:27:17] thing that's interesting about human beings and so you can put yourself you can you can stand up
[02:27:21] to things you're afraid of you know and measure doses and you find that you grow to be larger
[02:27:28] than the thing that you're afraid of and you know that's like that's like one of the basic rules
[02:27:32] of clinical therapies like if people are afraid of something you break it down into pieces
[02:27:37] and you have them encounter the things they're afraid of and they don't get less afraid
[02:27:42] they get braver and more competent which is way better because there's plenty of things to be
[02:27:47] afraid of so so once again here's just a total alignment I wrote this kid's book it's called
[02:27:53] way of the work okay I read it okay so I didn't know about this but I knew what I did with my kids
[02:27:59] and in the book you know the kids scared of water and he has not a swim so he starts off waiting
[02:28:03] in the water and then he eventually dunks his head in the water and then eventually he
[02:28:07] covers up to his neck in the water and then eventually he swims a little bit and then he finally
[02:28:12] jumps off the bridge but that's when I heard you describing that process and some interview that
[02:28:17] you were on or one of your podcasts I said I put that in my book and I didn't even know it yes
[02:28:22] progressive exposure and so what you want to do and what you want to do is you can do this for yourself
[02:28:27] you think okay here's something I'm afraid of doing okay and so I won't do it because I'm actually
[02:28:32] afraid of it okay find decompose it like let's say you're afraid to go on a subway you have
[02:28:36] agrofolbia it's like okay go online and look at a bunch of pictures of a subway can you do that
[02:28:44] go to the subway station and look at the subway station and then go home or go into the subway
[02:28:51] station and open the doors and go in and then go home but don't don't play tricks on yourself right
[02:28:57] if you say that you're going to go and just look then just go and look and then go home you know
[02:29:02] because otherwise you won't trust yourself the next time you do it so you have to keep the bargain
[02:29:06] intact but and what you want to do is you want to push yourself a little farther than you want to go
[02:29:13] but so that you would go that's all you have to do and that's that's kind of a rule for
[02:29:19] for learning in life so this happens the reason it works is because this is actually how human beings
[02:29:24] learn and so if you watch a kid maybe let's say a kid that's a little inhibited because some kids
[02:29:30] will just take off what we'll use the kids it's little inhibited so they're around their mom and they're
[02:29:36] in the playground and there's strange kids there maybe they're like four years old something like that and so
[02:29:41] they're thinking about maybe that they'll go out and play and so they hang around mom for a while and they
[02:29:45] check out the situation and then they'll go out a little bit and check it out a bit more and then they
[02:29:50] come back and maybe they need a little patch or something like that you know because they're coming
[02:29:53] back to home territory then the next time they go out a little farther then they'll come back
[02:29:58] and then next time they go a little farther and then they'll come back because they want to know
[02:30:02] they can come back and they're checking to see how far out they can go and if you're patient and
[02:30:07] encouraging even with kids that are quite nervous you know you encourage them to to to keep going out
[02:30:13] and exploring then they'll habituate and well what they do is learn their competent and the way they go
[02:30:19] and so it's not surprising that graduated exposure works because that is actually how human beings
[02:30:25] learn to confront the world but it's a great technique and the story in the book it wasn't my
[02:30:30] my daughter was at stage fright but she wanted to be in the school musical and so it was started
[02:30:35] with her and her room singing by herself but I was outside the door with the door shut yeah and then
[02:30:40] it was okay you sing with the door open and this happened over you know a couple weeks
[02:30:43] stamp now now the door is open now I'm going to stand in the doorway now mom and I are going to
[02:30:47] stand in the doorway now we're actually going to come in and sit down and watch you sing and then
[02:30:50] it was the family's going to watch you sing and then the neighbors are going to come watch you sing
[02:30:53] and eventually she has no issues whatsoever right now very confident kid but that was yeah that's
[02:30:59] perfect I translated it into the water for the story for whatever reason but yeah yeah well that
[02:31:05] also means that see what I like about that story too is that you established an individual relationship
[02:31:10] with your daughter you know because kids have different temperaments so like some kids if you take
[02:31:16] them to the playground it's like they're like pop you put them down on the ground they're like
[02:31:20] puppies over water they're feet will be going before they hit the ground and they're just gone right
[02:31:24] they're out there playing with the kids those are extraverted kids who don't have very high levels
[02:31:28] of negative emotion and your problem is going to be that they'll run off too far you know so
[02:31:34] but then other kids are more they're more inhibited and often they're a little more introverted
[02:31:38] they're a little higher negative emotion so then what you want to do is calibrate and you have
[02:31:42] to watch it's like okay how much can this kid tolerate it's like we'll push it and you can you
[02:31:48] configure that out it's like it it has to you have to push them enough so that if they accomplish it
[02:31:53] they feel that that's an accomplishment it can't be too easy but it can't be too hard you want to
[02:31:58] put them right on that edge that's the edge between order and chaos right fundamentally you want
[02:32:03] to put them on that edge and let them experience what it's like to be there and then they also
[02:32:07] learn that they can be there because you know you charter two things you charter that she could
[02:32:12] sing in front of a group but you also taught her that she could learn to do something she was afraid
[02:32:18] of doing and that's a way better lesson right that's a killer lesson so so that's good that that means
[02:32:25] and you can do that with kids too with graduated reward like you can watch them and if they do
[02:32:31] something well I I'll tell you how I did this with my daughter so my daughter had arthritis and it
[02:32:36] was really bad and she had to learn to give herself and well she had taken injections every day and so
[02:32:43] and then I think that started when she was like seven and so we could give her the injections but she
[02:32:49] was pretty skittish about that and no wonder because they hurt and everything so I thought all right
[02:32:55] tell with this we'll we'll get her to do her own injections and so I sat her down and I said she was
[02:33:01] pretty motivated by money she's always been kind of a capitalist kid so we found her outside
[02:33:07] once when she was for selling all her child books on the street which was quite funny I think she was
[02:33:12] maybe five but whatever I said look kiddo I'm going to give you this needle and if you can
[02:33:20] give you if you can inject this yourself in 45 minutes I'll give you 50 bucks and so I let her
[02:33:29] sit and she like struggled with that she struggled with that day and but by about 30 minutes she did it
[02:33:35] and I thought that could work man could work so then the next time I said okay this time it's
[02:33:41] 30 bucks but you got 10 minutes to do it and so she did it and you know soon we got it down so
[02:33:47] that because I wanted to get it down so there was no hesitation right because actually the anticipatory
[02:33:51] anxiety is worse than the needle so you want to push it so it's like okay now and we got to the
[02:33:57] point where it was um if you can do it in five seconds I'll give you 10 bucks and so she got to the
[02:34:02] point took about a week where she could do it in five seconds and I kept paying her because well
[02:34:07] for obvious reasons you know I mean it was kind of unfortunate she was very sick and she had these
[02:34:11] needles and we had to do some things that would sort of perk her up you know to some degree but
[02:34:17] that was a hard thing for a kid to learn you know it's not easy thing to give yourself a needle but
[02:34:22] you can use that graduated exposure and careful reward you can get kids to do very
[02:34:26] brief things and then they also learn how tough they are it's like and she was proud of that man you
[02:34:31] know she did she could go and do it by herself because that was a big deal it also gave her some
[02:34:36] control over your illness so confidence that's what you want to instill in your kids unless you're
[02:34:41] jealous of them so now you also talked about you started talking about some various personality
[02:34:48] traits and how those come through and you just released what a month ago a new program
[02:34:53] understand yourself understand myself don't call myself dot com yeah and I also put up a discount
[02:35:00] code for your people for that too so it's willing again and 20% that would make it about 795 so it's
[02:35:06] pretty cheap what you do is it you answer a hundred questions the questions are pretty standard like
[02:35:13] they've been derived from the standard scientific literature partly from a test that I designed
[02:35:18] that my students designed about in 2007 calling the young who's now a professor at the University of
[02:35:24] Minnesota and we we statistically analyzed this question set so we could break out five major
[02:35:32] personality traits and those are the standard traits that psychologists believe are reliable and
[02:35:37] valid and they've been working on that since about 1960 and so that's extra version and that's
[02:35:43] uh it can break breaks into two aspects so extraverted people are assertive and enthusiastic it's
[02:35:51] the positive emotion dimension they're talking of they and they like to be in social groups they
[02:35:55] like to plant parties they like they like to talk and they're smiley and so forth and then there's
[02:36:02] a negative emotion dimension neuroticism and people who are high neuroticism are that can be
[02:36:08] broken into withdrawal and volatility and people who withdraw have a lot of anticipatory anxiety
[02:36:13] so they might shy away from doing something and volatile people are kind of touchy you know they're
[02:36:17] easily set off so agreeableness agreeable people are compassionate and polite disagreeable people are
[02:36:25] tough and blunt and so women are higher in agreeableness than men and they're higher in negative
[02:36:31] emotion as well conscientiousness which is the best long-term predictor of life success after
[02:36:38] intelligence conscientious people are doodiful and so they're industrious and orderly and orderlyness
[02:36:45] is a good predictor of conservative political philosophy by the way or political affiliation along with
[02:36:50] low the last dimension is openness and open people are interested in ideas so that's intellect
[02:36:58] and creative and we call that openness it's openness to experiences the main trait and the
[02:37:03] creativity trait is openness proper so this report gives you a comparative description so you
[02:37:12] compared to other people on all five of those dimensions plus all of those ten aspects and that
[02:37:17] can help you understand who you are and that's very useful because one of the things you want to do
[02:37:23] in life is figure out what your temperament is so that you can find a niche in the economy or in the
[02:37:30] social world that you're suited to so like if you're an introvert while computer programming
[02:37:35] is not a bad idea or accounting or something like that but if you're extroverted you got to be
[02:37:39] out with people you know and if you're high in negative emotion you're going to want to job
[02:37:42] that's not too stressful and that's fairly secure and if you're open then you're not your
[02:37:46] panorial or creative type and if you're agreeable you should be working with people and if you're
[02:37:51] disagreeable you should be working with things and so anyways the reports detail all of that
[02:37:57] and so then once people see where they fall out they can kind of put themselves into a better
[02:38:02] position like you said a job that suits them and that's going to be yeah well that's it you know
[02:38:09] it's you you you do have a temperament and there is a place for each temperament in the economy in the
[02:38:16] world because otherwise they wouldn't exist and so the issue is what is your temperament so if you're
[02:38:21] high in openness you need you need to engage in something creative because you won't be healthy
[02:38:26] if you don't because it's like a major if you're like a tree with different trunks it's like
[02:38:31] that's one of the trunks it might be the major one you can't let that thing die because it'll
[02:38:35] take a big part of it with you and if you're disagreeable say you're a competitive type and so
[02:38:40] you're going to need some of that in your life and if you're conscientious if you're conscientious
[02:38:45] that's a really good predictor of military uh uh performance by the way then you need a routine
[02:38:53] and you need to be you need to be locked on to some task you know because otherwise you'll consume
[02:38:58] yourself with guilt um so so it's very important to understand who you are in that way and it's also
[02:39:06] important that's interesting because that's I can tell you that that's sort of the middle of the
[02:39:11] bell curve and even like towards the higher end of the bell curve of military performers are you know
[02:39:18] people that are can concentrate on the task they're going to be relatively obedient but when you get
[02:39:23] to either end either high end either the low end of bad performers but also the high end or the
[02:39:30] people that know and to break the rules that are slightly rebellious that will rebel that will
[02:39:35] tell you know one of the big ones you know I don't want to be surrounded by people that are
[02:39:40] telling me that I'm right all the time I don't want my subordinates I don't have people that are
[02:39:44] working for me that are going to when I say go charge that machine gun as they say okay and they go do it
[02:39:48] you might think that that's what I want and that might be the the overall perception of people in
[02:39:53] the military I want a robot that's going to fall my orders I actually don't if I tell you to go
[02:39:58] charge that machine gun as and it's not and it's going to get you and your men killed I actually
[02:40:02] want you to say hey jockel that doesn't sound like a good plan to me let's do something else let's
[02:40:06] come around to the flank so so it's interesting that yeah you'll be good in that middle part
[02:40:11] and you might even get towards the higher end but the guys that are really valuable in the military
[02:40:16] are the guys that also have that openness and that creativity and or and at the same time are able
[02:40:22] to discipline and harness it's right they can conform when they need to right well and they need to
[02:40:28] which I actually had to do as I got older the older when I first got in you know I was the guy
[02:40:32] pushing the envelope I long here and so everything that I could do would maxed out to stay within the
[02:40:37] bounds of what we're supposed to be doing and and then as I got older I realized I got that
[02:40:42] stuff so important what's important is that you're able to do your job good and you have
[02:40:45] creativity not with how you have your stupid haircut but in how you come up with a mission plan
[02:40:52] right that's where I expressed my creativity not through not through pushing the envelope of
[02:40:57] uniform standards which is which is what a lot of immature young military guys do
[02:41:03] right right well and the thing about the people who will stand up and tell you what they think
[02:41:08] is that they tend to be disagreeable types as well and you know you hear a lot about emotional
[02:41:13] intelligence in the business world these days but emotional intelligence is really indistinguishable
[02:41:18] from trait agreeableness and so agreeable people are polite and compassionate and that's great especially
[02:41:23] if you're taking care of people but you want some disagreeable people around because they'll tell you
[02:41:28] what they think and they're blunt well isn't emotional intelligence though can you be agreeable but not
[02:41:33] be able to re-I always think of it as me being able to read people like I understand oh that person
[02:41:37] has got got let's go on that's their agenda is in the background so even though I might be agreeable
[02:41:43] but I'm also understanding where you're coming from well I think that that's what emotional
[02:41:48] intelligence is if it's anything valid but the tests that test it tend to correlate very highly
[02:41:53] with agreeableness and so actually agreeable managers don't make better bit managers disagreeable
[02:41:59] managers make better managers well they have to be conscientious as well because a disagreeable
[02:42:03] person whose conscientious is actually relatively easy to work for because they'll tell you what they think
[02:42:09] but they'll do what they say you know and they can make tough decisions and you often have to
[02:42:14] make decisions that are somewhat harsh in order to move things ahead in the long term right because
[02:42:20] if you're soft it means you'll sacrifice the long term for the short term and if you're tough
[02:42:26] but but have your head screwed on straight it means you'll make tough decisions in the present
[02:42:31] that might ruffle feathers and hurt people's feelings but they make the medium to long term better
[02:42:36] and so no that's absolutely attractive all the time especially with younger companies they go
[02:42:40] through that expansion phase and all of a sudden they got to they go through the retraction phase
[02:42:45] and they got to fire people and and they wait because the the leader is too agreeable and too soft
[02:42:51] and so they wait and all of a sudden they're upside down finance and it's a real problem
[02:42:55] whereas if they would have been aggressive and said you know what here's the decision we got to
[02:42:57] make I know it's going to hurt right now but long term it's going to be good first we got to get
[02:43:01] rid of this division or this department or these people and if they don't have the ability to do that
[02:43:05] it really hurts them in the world yeah well that's the sacrifice of the future for the present and that's
[02:43:09] generally a bad idea the other thing with the understand myself system is that you can also use it
[02:43:17] to like if if you do the the program and get your results and someone else does someone you're close to
[02:43:23] say you can compare them and that's really useful because you think you understand people but you
[02:43:28] don't understand them as well as you think so for example my daughter was fairly well she she was
[02:43:35] quite ill so it was complicated but she was touchy let's say when she was a teenager and I thought
[02:43:42] it was because she was rebellious but she did the personality test and my son by contrast was
[02:43:48] very easy to get along with but then we had them do the personality test and it turned out she was very
[02:43:52] high in agreeableness and compassion but also pretty high in negative emotion whereas he was the
[02:43:58] opposite he was very disagreeable but very low in negative emotion so he wasn't easy to get along with
[02:44:05] he just never got upset but if you ever tried to get him to do something he didn't want to do that
[02:44:09] was like impossible and he was like that from the time he was two years old whereas my daughter
[02:44:13] wasn't rebelliousness it was that she was easily made anxious and upset and so I learned at least
[02:44:19] to somewhat so if she if she sort of flared up instead of interpreting that as as rebelliousness or
[02:44:25] or or or or or conflict I just saw it as nervousness and that helped a lot you know it didn't
[02:44:31] make me able to deal with it 100% but it helped a lot it was quite shocking to me because you know
[02:44:36] I thought I knew my kids and and I did I think but that was very useful and then it was really
[02:44:44] funny because then as she started to date she had every boyfriend she ever went out with take the
[02:44:49] personality test first so I thought that was really common that actually worked out quite well
[02:44:53] well the thing is you know you you want to be not are the boys not smart enough to like manipulate
[02:44:59] the answers well they don't necessarily know what she wants I would at least assume like okay I'm
[02:45:05] trying to sound agreeable and I'm trying I remember I had to take psychological tests to uh and this
[02:45:10] was in the 90s they gave us one you think they had some big battery of psychological examinations
[02:45:15] and interviews to get in this whole team's no took like one test during boot camp and it was funny
[02:45:21] because I was really hungry when I was in boot camp because of the food sucks and I just thought
[02:45:25] man I want to pass this test and I knew I had some things in my brain that weren't going to be
[02:45:31] smile upon by whatever analyst was going to read these things so and was complete the scent these
[02:45:37] are the things I remember was complete the scent and so it said for instance I hate when my mom
[02:45:44] and you fill in the blank and obviously it's really easy to go sideways on that thing right
[02:45:49] if you're a psychopath but for me every answer that I gave was you know for me it was I hate when my
[02:45:55] mom doesn't cook enough noodles with this spaghetti everything that I gave was just about food
[02:46:00] they must have thought I was a a food psychopath they were getting nothing out of me nothing
[02:46:08] I think the test that my daughter used was when I designed that people couldn't fake
[02:46:13] so it wasn't quite as accurate with regards to the individual personality traits but it was
[02:46:18] more difficult to fake good on which is a better for hiring people for example what kind of
[02:46:22] question can you not fake in oh well are you hardworking or are you easy to get along with
[02:46:30] right are you creative or disciplined right right or are you are you exactly are you
[02:46:37] neurotic and anxious or are you inhibited and and now can you awkward with people can you go in
[02:46:45] between is it a one to ten it's either or yeah with that without particular pairing it is
[02:46:50] and then you've paired all these questions so that eventually you get that's right something that's
[02:46:55] right well or or maybe here's ten negative statements which five applied to you most people hate
[02:47:01] those particular but they're quite accurate so we use those for personnel selection for a while
[02:47:06] so for me it would be are you agreeable a discipline hungry is yeah yeah now before we close
[02:47:14] at you you also have the book maps of meaning yeah and and for those people that were expecting
[02:47:20] me to do the book maps of meaning on this podcast and review it in depth there is literally
[02:47:25] no reason because you have already done that online on YouTube and on your podcast you go through
[02:47:31] in great detail better detail than I would have been able to in one podcast because you have
[02:47:37] a series of podcasts about maps of meaning it's fascinating it's awesome everything that you
[02:47:42] kind of touched on today is in there in great depth and you know there's many worshipers
[02:47:48] of mark-up out there now thanks to you and and I'm sure that will expand and if you want to get
[02:47:54] into that the book is called maps of meaning the architecture of belief it's very interesting I
[02:48:00] also like that you have the you talk about some of your clients as which by the way I didn't
[02:48:04] talk about you at all in the opening I realized that about halfway through this podcast that I
[02:48:09] didn't actually explain who you were so is there anything you need to say about yourself that I
[02:48:14] should have said I mean well there's just the bare basis well I'm a clinical psychologist I've
[02:48:20] practiced for about two and a half decades I've done a lot of business consulting
[02:48:26] as well as clinical work I'm a professor at the University of Toronto in psychology and I
[02:48:31] might domains of expertise or personality assessment and neuroscience and the study of belief systems
[02:48:37] like religious belief systems and and I that's basically the and I have a family I'm married and
[02:48:44] have been for just about 30 years and I've got two kids in a new grandchild and so that's and I
[02:48:51] become somewhat notorious on YouTube over the last year really it's been that and so that's been
[02:48:57] quite the bizarre trip you might say so so everyone can go and explore that yeah you're pretty
[02:49:04] um I guess the other thing I should say because my publicist will be on my case if I don't
[02:49:10] as that I have another book coming out which is much more straightforward than maps of meeting
[02:49:15] which is quite a technical book and that book is going to be called 12 rules for life yeah
[02:49:20] an antidote to chaos yeah and it's available for pre-order on Amazon already so January 23rd
[02:49:27] that's when it comes out yep and I'm hoping that now that's that one maybe you come back on here
[02:49:32] and we could talk a little bit about that book that'd be good that would be that would be good
[02:49:37] that book will be right up I mean you've touched on it a little bit you've mentioned a couple of the
[02:49:41] 12 rules yep today I think you mentioned two of the 12 rules today and that would be awesome
[02:49:47] they have you come back on and again I think people after they hear this if they didn't already know who you are
[02:49:51] they'll they'll go and research who you are they're going to want to um get that book
[02:49:55] down to be great to have you back on there and then obviously you've got your own podcast
[02:50:00] yep the Jordan B Peterson podcast yes you've got your YouTube channel yeah
[02:50:07] Jordan Jordan Peterson videos and Jordan Peterson clips yes you just put out yes
[02:50:14] echo wasn't that you know crafty to come out with a thing like a separate thing two channels yeah
[02:50:19] so he's got two gems he's the one that's supposed to make the clips
[02:50:23] yeah well one of the things that's been so strange I mean learning to use YouTube
[02:50:27] people have been clipping my work like mad which is not something I expected like I would say right now
[02:50:33] there's probably 40 new clips a day being put on by people which is really good you know I mean
[02:50:38] I've got no problem without at all but I thought I might as well see what would happen if we also
[02:50:44] did it and so I put my my my sons fiancee on that as my daughter as well so they've been doing that
[02:50:50] clipping and so but yeah it's cool that the YouTube videos are so interesting as well as the podcast
[02:50:56] because people can can do their own thing with them to some degree you know that can be bad
[02:51:03] depending on how they do the editing but so far my people have been responding very positively
[02:51:08] to what I've been doing which is quite a shock to me but I think it I think it
[02:51:16] you've made reference to this as well in the in the fact that you've found a ready audience is like
[02:51:21] people are ready for a message that's not all freedom and rights you know it's like Jesus enough
[02:51:28] of that like really seriously we've been walking down that road for 60 years it's time to look at
[02:51:36] the alternative ethics and responsibility that's a big one and especially when it is the case that
[02:51:43] you know you think freedom gives your life more meaning that's true if you're under a tyranny
[02:51:47] but if you're not then it's responsibility that gives your life meaning and you your life has to
[02:51:53] have meaning it has negative meaning whether you want it or not you choose whether or not it has
[02:51:57] positive meaning and you choose that by adopting responsibility and so and like there's a ready
[02:52:04] market for that because we've ignored that reality for too long so I'm sure you don't say
[02:52:12] it are now at the point where they realize that being free free free is getting them anywhere
[02:52:17] yeah well I always think it's like you know okay you want to be free all right I'll take you out
[02:52:21] drop you in the middle of the ocean it's like you can swim in any direction like that's not helpful
[02:52:27] you know you gotta be swimming be different if I dropped you near an island and said well swim to that
[02:52:32] it's like yeah I can do that that's that's got meaning I won't drown I won't die but
[02:52:37] there's no difference between too much freedom and chaos right and you drown in chaos you need the right
[02:52:43] balance of freedom and order and and and discipline well as you said or also which is a
[02:52:50] paradoxical thing the more discipline you have the more self discipline the more freedom even
[02:52:57] putting in those hour breaks that you described you know sometimes when I've been too busy which has
[02:53:03] been fairly frequent I'll take an hour break you know and I can actually have a break
[02:53:09] because I've done the things that I was supposed to do and so even though it's an hour long I can
[02:53:15] actually relax during that hour not being plagued by my conscience there aren't things undone you know
[02:53:20] and so that's that's that's a really good thing to be able to attain when you feel that
[02:53:26] you've got things you've got the right things reasonably under control and you're moving up hill
[02:53:32] that's better than anything else really yeah speaking of getting things under control echo
[02:53:39] yeah maybe could you tell people quickly how they could support this podcast try to make it
[02:53:46] I don't feel like we should keep talking about what we've been talking about yeah yeah yeah yeah
[02:53:50] I hear you actually have a question two questions okay you know so with the recent kind of
[02:53:55] right everyone waits for in the podcast and so little bit more you know with the rise of your
[02:54:03] exposure we'll call it do people kind of flock to your class now well no not so much to my class but
[02:54:10] they're definitely flocking to public talks yeah so and and my class is generally being quite popular you know
[02:54:19] so that's so and yeah and and I'm on sabbatical this year so we'll see what happens when I
[02:54:26] when I return was that lucker did you pre-court it that well it was actually the grace
[02:54:30] good grace of the university you know because well I had to get my act back together after all these
[02:54:36] things happened you know and I've also had some health problems over the last year that have been
[02:54:40] rather severe which I think I have under control maybe but I told them that look I'm going to be
[02:54:47] much better if I take this year and and do what's necessary for this book that's coming out and
[02:54:54] re-conceptualize what I'm going to be teaching because the other thing I is I have to do that I've
[02:54:58] got all these lectures recorded now they're on YouTube it's like it is not obvious to me why I should
[02:55:03] do them again I've done like there's three years of some of them online so I have to free I have to
[02:55:10] rethink what I'm doing as a university lecture because with YouTube you know you can do something new
[02:55:14] like this biblical series that I'd be doing you can do something new and you can have it out
[02:55:20] in front of 150,000 people in one day it's like well you got to think about that that's a whole
[02:55:24] different universe and I like doing lectures on things that I'm I'm still learning about it's hard to
[02:55:31] do that at a university because you have to have the evaluation structure people have to know
[02:55:35] what to expect and you know it has to be pre-planned and that's not so good if you want to do
[02:55:41] something that's novel so I've got a lot of thinking about that and I don't know what's going to happen
[02:55:46] this next year in any case so you find that like let's say you did a talk about something specific
[02:55:53] and people saw it online I think a lot of times people were more compelled to see that same one
[02:55:59] in person like a concert you know like oh yeah I listen to that an old zz top listen to zz time
[02:56:06] and you know I have the CD or whatever but they're in town for a concert or they're you know
[02:56:10] in the next day for a concert I want to go see the concert well I think I think that that works out okay
[02:56:16] for me because there are these underlying themes that permeate everything that I'm saying and
[02:56:22] I would say those are the archetypal themes so I have this sort of structured way of presenting
[02:56:27] information that's based on well the work I did for maps of meaning and so even if the lectures
[02:56:32] new there's echoes of the of the other ones always I mean one of the things about archetypal
[02:56:38] stories is that an image is that they're very expansive you know and so they're multi-faceted
[02:56:44] and so you end up touching on the same themes over and over but from different perspectives
[02:56:49] you know and one of the things people tell me all the time which is really interesting and this
[02:56:54] is really being the case for 30 years as they come up to me after the lecture they say you know
[02:56:59] you were telling me things that already knew but I didn't know I knew them yeah and that's definitely
[02:57:05] an archetypal experience because you know your your experience does have a certain structure
[02:57:11] and that doesn't mean you can say what it is but if you hear it being said then you know
[02:57:17] that that's what it is and so it's fun in front of a crowd because I can watch that happen to people
[02:57:23] they because I'm always speaking to individuals within the crowd and I'll say something and
[02:57:27] someone will go like this yeah your eyes are open a little bit of the jerk back a little bit
[02:57:30] I think yes so that just clicked a couple of days together for you just really well that's fun
[02:57:36] I get the same thing so with with extreme ownership the book and you know it's about leadership principles
[02:57:42] and we say in the book these are not new these have been around for hundreds and in some cases thousands
[02:57:48] of years of how militaries run organizations and therefore the military leadership principles
[02:57:54] are actually the same as all leadership principles because you're trying to get a bunch of
[02:57:57] crazy human beings to do something that's going to behind a mission and execute it in the most
[02:58:03] efficient way but people say I you know I I kind of always I always thought that I should do that
[02:58:08] I always I've always done that yeah but yeah you captured it and it's a self-awareness I think
[02:58:13] when people they maybe they do have good natural leadership judgment and they've always taken
[02:58:19] responsibility for things and but they never really thought about it they just kind of did it
[02:58:22] well then once they know hey I need to take ownership of things well then then they really can do it
[02:58:26] yeah and they also see it in their subordinate leadership and they go that guy's not taking ownership
[02:58:30] of things they're not doing a good job and it's the same thing with keeping things simple or
[02:58:33] decentralized command or prioritizing execute these are things that successful leaders do prioritize
[02:58:39] an execute if you get a leader that's going to try and accomplish 37 different things at the same
[02:58:43] time they're not going to be successful so so leaders they know to prioritize an execute good
[02:58:48] leaders but when we say it to them you know they might still they might not do 37 things but they
[02:58:53] might do try and do eight things at the same time and they know that they should be doing one or two
[02:58:57] and and when they hear us say it and describe they go yeah that's one of the things that characterizes
[02:59:04] a leader is that he or she knows where they're going right I mean that's that's that's the
[02:59:09] fundamental principle that you have to be able to communicate it too but that's I worked for
[02:59:13] a UN committee at one point on economic sustainability economic and environmentalist sustainability
[02:59:22] and one of the problems with the first draft of the report and I would say the final draft to
[02:59:27] some degree is that you know it was all done by committees so there are 100 priorities it's like no
[02:59:33] there aren't 100 priorities that's a contradiction in terms it's like you start with one of these
[02:59:39] things and maybe you start with a small piece of it and see if it works but it's to have 100 priorities
[02:59:45] is to make no one dissatisfied but you're not going to you're not going to move because you can't
[02:59:51] move in 100 directions at the same time so it's a real abdication of and and people do that in a
[02:59:56] sneaky way too because they're abdicating their responsibility right say well we're going to
[03:00:01] move in 100 directions and everyone had input it's like well that's not the issue the issue is how
[03:00:07] you condense that down to an actual action plan and that actually makes you accountable that's the
[03:00:13] thing and that's why people don't do it it's like well if you're going to 100 directions then it's
[03:00:17] hard to see whether you're you're doing it well but if you're going to wonder action that doesn't
[03:00:22] work it's like well that's pretty obvious so people are afraid to do that but if you don't do it
[03:00:27] it's failure yeah I get the same thing when I get people now they ask me a question and I give
[03:00:32] them the answer they said you're going to say that yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
[03:00:36] yeah I know I know yeah I'm one of those people but yeah yeah he does that from time to time yeah
[03:00:40] oh also how you're talking about kind of breaking the loop in your behavior like oh I want to
[03:00:44] make a change to that one thing you know to break the loop and then you start with something small
[03:00:48] then it ends up affecting more things and you mentioned sometimes it's hard because you don't
[03:00:54] get paths on the back for those little things you know yeah well they're often so small they're
[03:00:59] humiliating that you even have to do them yeah yeah but in a lot of time like to yourself it's
[03:01:04] like kind of big like like oh I'm going to drink eight glasses of water a day now you know and then
[03:01:10] it's almost like you're seeking that pad on the back like you want to tell your friend like hey
[03:01:13] I drink eight glass of water now and they're just like yeah so yeah right and you're like
[03:01:19] why do I party you kind of like why do I even do it then if no one's going to care you know well
[03:01:24] you know there's a lesson to be drawn from that too in terms of relationships that's really
[03:01:29] useful psychologically is and and this is a big mistake that people want make it's like if you want
[03:01:35] to have a good long-term relationship with someone then you watch them constantly and when they
[03:01:40] do something that you like you let them know even if it's a small thing yeah because they're way
[03:01:46] more likely to do it again you know and so sometimes a personal have kind of an inkling about what
[03:01:51] they might do that's good or that would be good for your relationship with you or that might even
[03:01:56] just be pleasing to you but they won't say anything they're like afraid because maybe they won't
[03:02:00] get attention for it and but then they do it and you notice it's like man that's super powerful
[03:02:05] like you have to be really attentive though because the good things that people do don't stand out
[03:02:10] the mistakes they make stand out and then you say well you may have a stake it's like yeah
[03:02:15] but to to watch and to reward someone for doing something small right that's that's a step in the
[03:02:20] right direction that is a killer strategy I found that to be true with my daughter she's four and
[03:02:26] half now oh yeah well that some kids really like some kids are tough and they don't respond to
[03:02:31] punishment at all yeah you just can't you can't you can't you can't intimidate them yeah
[03:02:37] my daughter if I just pointed at her she would stop but my son it was like that was just around
[03:02:42] one he just laughed he just laughed it in a way yeah so but he responded to reward like mad if I
[03:02:48] watched him and he did something that was good and I told him that it was like he was just yeah
[03:02:54] so that's good yeah it's reward is harder to use but it's more effective if you can manage it
[03:03:00] yeah and then that's not like kind of how you say where you're like be careful with the reward
[03:03:04] when you give like too much you word for these small things you know and then they go that's
[03:03:08] the problem that's problem with the self-esteem movement you know oh every every kid gets a
[03:03:13] trophy day yeah it's no it's like inflating the currency if everything is good then nothing is good
[03:03:21] because there has to be a distinction so yeah you want to watch and you want to see when the
[03:03:26] person's made an effort and you want to see when they've gone beyond the call of duty and then you
[03:03:31] want to say hey I noticed that that was really good yeah and it is scarcity really matters in
[03:03:36] those situations because otherwise it just turns into noise yeah patronizing noise even which is
[03:03:41] even worse it's like oh you're doing well right you're doing well it's like leave me alone yeah
[03:03:46] it's such a lie yeah I have a fun time with that actually I'll put like um if I have the judge
[03:03:52] and all through my kids lives if I had to judge them and their friends and I have three daughters
[03:03:57] in one son usually it was the daughters I was being some kind of a judge I'm gonna judge the dance
[03:04:02] I'm gonna judge the little play that they put together I'm gonna judge the uh acrobatic routine
[03:04:09] that they're doing in the backyard and I always be judging these things and I would have so much fun
[03:04:13] because I would say they do their little performance they're one minute performance and they come
[03:04:20] out table how was it and I'd say okay first of all presentation overall I'm giving you a 4.2
[03:04:28] I didn't see once my on till you actually got on stage that's raw and I would just go through
[03:04:33] and give them this really strong critique and and they loved it yeah they loved it that's a
[03:04:39] dance mad they would be happy to and they go try to give them try to raise that 4.3 to a 4.5
[03:04:46] they'd be smiles like you could you know some of my all the way oh yeah yeah yeah I just got
[03:04:51] done a set of at a pool party with a bunch of little kids running around and I ended up
[03:04:55] judging the diving competition and all the parents were watching and and they were
[03:05:01] aghast at what I was doing yeah that was in my house by the way oh I did it there too
[03:05:05] no I do it on the basis but I did it at your house too right yeah you seen it in action
[03:05:09] yeah I give the kids a little late names and then and then I say you know you were
[03:05:15] completely unbalanced when you left the board it was almost embarrassing for me to watch
[03:05:21] go try it again I'm giving you a 2.2 yeah go try it again and see if you can bump
[03:05:25] that up a little bit yeah and the kids get all motivated they go there and I was just
[03:05:29] having a 2.5 or you've treated them like someone who could improve right so that's a big deal
[03:05:35] that's better than that's better than a pat on the back it's like because everyone's flawed
[03:05:40] and everyone needs to improve also when my kids were little I taught them how to speak
[03:05:45] in public talk about an hour that was it so I had them they had to read something you know and
[03:05:53] so they'd read it and I was across rum and say well that's not loud enough it's like I can't
[03:05:58] hear you like belt it out and they get a lot a little louder it's no no no no I that doesn't
[03:06:03] want to mean read it way louder than you think you should and so they did that and I said
[03:06:08] lots about right because there's nothing more appalling than listening to some speaker that you
[03:06:12] can't hear it's like there's just no excuse for that and then like make it clearer put some
[03:06:17] passion into it you know and it was unbelievable how quickly they would pick that up you know and
[03:06:23] that also made me sad because because it took so little time to get them to do that and then they
[03:06:30] had it you know and so and that that like a critic is your best friend if the critic isn't
[03:06:37] destructive because what a critic does is say look you did ten things and like these five things
[03:06:45] you need some work on those they're not good and here's some things you could do that would
[03:06:49] make them better and here's two things that you got all right and here's three things that you did
[03:06:53] pretty well at and so then well what's the message the message is hey you can handle some actual
[03:06:59] criticism so you're not some little you know useless wimpy thing that's gonna die just because
[03:07:04] someone isn't telling you that you're already wonderful plus you're not already what not nearly
[03:07:10] as wonderful as you could get so let's keep that in mind and then you know you lay out a pathway
[03:07:15] for improvement and then you treat the kid with some respect and you also show that being in the
[03:07:20] adult means that you know more than being a kid because you you know the kid does something you
[03:07:24] say well that was really good it's like what are you saying well as an adult I don't know any better
[03:07:29] than you do and that's pretty dismal message because the kid is gonna be an adult for a very long time
[03:07:35] and one of the things we do really badly in our culture is model why being an adult is better than
[03:07:41] being a child because it is better you have freedom and you have responsibility and you have autonomy
[03:07:47] and so we're always so concerned about making our kids feel good about themselves it's like
[03:07:52] they should be feel good about becoming responsible adults because they're gonna be adults for like
[03:07:57] 80 years and they're gonna be kids for like 20 years so the adults the goal so
[03:08:06] yeah that was interesting when you started doing that because the kids are like seven years old
[03:08:10] and under but yeah and he's like letting them have it but you it's funny you have this kind of tone
[03:08:15] about you though when you talk to kids that it's like it's almost like live that much over theatrical
[03:08:19] you know just that much so you can tell he's like playing a character on the right right and the kids love
[03:08:24] it it's so funny my daughter like loves him and the kids are just scrambling around wanting to do it again
[03:08:31] and like let me do this let me do your daughters all you stood you she's like okay okay she
[03:08:35] was so funny kids though you know big jockels like kids you love the tension yeah it's their
[03:08:42] currency and they want attention because adults actually know more than they do and so if you
[03:08:48] pick careful attention like I get along really well with little kids and it's because I pay attention
[03:08:52] to them and if they do something good then we had this kid over at our house once this is a sad story
[03:08:59] I told it in my new book so this kid was about for a really cute kid really nice looking
[03:09:07] kid and his nanny had been hurt in a car accident so he was kind of being shuffled around the
[03:09:13] neighborhood for for daycare for like a week or so and I heard some not some rumors about this
[03:09:18] kid and so I was kind of curious and so anyways came over to our house my my wife was also
[03:09:25] taking care of some other kids at this time and I came home and he was standing the other kids
[03:09:31] were playing in the like living room and he was standing in the porch sort of in the corner you know
[03:09:35] kind of just wandering around back and forth and I looked at them and I thought that's not so
[03:09:40] good so I kind of poked him a bit you know and let's poke them and trying to get him to play and he
[03:09:44] had this like really mask of a face on unhappy and I poked him and he kind of jerk away and all that
[03:09:50] and I couldn't get him to smile I couldn't get him to play it I thought that's not good that's
[03:09:54] not good because he's for like I he should have you know acted unhappy for two or three
[03:10:00] pokes and then kind of laughed and then we would kind of get into it you know so so that that wasn't
[03:10:06] so good so then we had lunch and the rule at our house was eat your damn lunch and say thank
[03:10:13] you to the person who made it because otherwise they'll cook you horrible things and then you'll die
[03:10:19] so it's like it's hard to cook lunch for you have some gratitude you little monsters and so you
[03:10:26] ate what what was there and so his mother when she dropped him off said he probably won't eat
[03:10:32] anything all day but that's all right and we thought well actually no that's not all right because
[03:10:39] he needs to eat and it's and it's not all right that he doesn't eat wrong and so we'd learned how to
[03:10:47] feed recalcitrant children by that point and so all the kids were at the table and they were eating
[03:10:53] and my wife had made some chicken stew and he wasn't eating and so she was trying to feed him and so
[03:10:59] we were watching him very carefully and so she bring up the spoon to his mouth and he like
[03:11:04] move his head back and forth you know to refuse it and it was just like about a nine month old
[03:11:09] would do that a when you're trying to if that's their their first trick and so that's a nine
[03:11:13] month old trick and we thought okay well something happened when he was nine months old and he never
[03:11:18] really got beyond that and so you know my wife was fairly persistent with the spoon and
[03:11:26] he'd get an oiden you know squawk bit she'd put some food in and then he'd swallow it and then
[03:11:31] and then as soon as he took a little bit of food he and she'd pat him and tell him that he was
[03:11:35] being a good kid and she meant it it was not a game like she she was really intent on getting this
[03:11:40] kid to have lunch and so so that's fine and he's moving his his head back and forth but
[03:11:46] what was cool as she kept patting him on the head and telling him it was good kid he was opening
[03:11:50] his mouth more often even though he was still moving his head back and forth and so it took about
[03:11:55] ten minutes or so and she'd fed him the whole bowl of chicken stew and she said she showed him
[03:12:01] and he said look you're a good boy you ate all of it and that horrible mask that he was wearing
[03:12:06] you know that mask of unhappiness it just fell off him and he had this great smile it was just
[03:12:12] it just made the hair on the back my neck stand up because you could see that was the first
[03:12:17] damn thing that he did being allowed to succeed that you know and so he was thrilled and then
[03:12:24] for the rest of the day he followed my wife around like a puppy dog like he was one step behind
[03:12:28] her and then we went downstairs into the basement and we were watching TV and he climbed up and
[03:12:32] her lap and he grabbed onto her just like there's this famous experiment that Harlow did with
[03:12:37] monkeys and the monkeys could either have the wire mother that fed them milk or the cuddly mother
[03:12:42] that they could cling to they were both artificial and the monkeys preferred the cuddly mother you
[03:12:47] know and that's what it was like he was just wrapped around her you know and then his mother came
[03:12:52] home and she came downstairs and she took one look at this kid wrapped around my wife and she said
[03:12:57] oh super mom and grabbed him and you know walked out and I thought you that was horrible
[03:13:05] that was a horrible thing to see because he was a one day with that kid you'd you'd fix him up
[03:13:12] you know it was one positive experience was enough to bring him out of his shell
[03:13:17] and you know it's okay that he doesn't eat it's okay that he stands in the corner doesn't play
[03:13:22] with the other kids you know it's okay that he's miserable and unhappy it's like hey guess what
[03:13:27] that's not okay it's not even a little bit okay so that's a good example of the user reward you
[03:13:32] know it it just it was something to see I'll tell you yeah well speaking of breaking the loops
[03:13:42] we'll talk about origin so origin American made stuff jocco has his own line of supplements
[03:13:51] so in the event of your joints because that's really the main one you're joints yeah
[03:13:56] jocco super krill krill oil better than fish oil by the way what do you make of this
[03:14:05] when someone kid so krill oil back in the day my wife's dad my father and lot you saw always
[03:14:11] say krill oil for your joints it's good and he's one of these like health for lack of better
[03:14:15] term health nuts all right I don't know if that's good or bad but and he'd be like yeah krill oil
[03:14:20] it's even even better than fish oil I'm like cool never listen never listen but then when
[03:14:25] jocco for some reason takes doesn't even say to take it just like he takes it then I start
[03:14:30] taking it and I reap the benefits of course because krill oil is dope but what do you make of that
[03:14:35] what did the krill oil do for you just it helped so you know how you get joint just from working
[03:14:40] now in doing stuff you know you join skits source by showing you get older whatever in my
[03:14:44] experience so I started taking krill oil and here's the example I said it before I'll try to make
[03:14:49] a quick so my daughter shoots four she's maybe three at the time three something and in the morning
[03:14:55] how she'd wake me up is she'd wake me up and then when I get up she'd jump on my back kind of
[03:14:59] she wouldn't let me walk downstairs without her in her back on my back so when she do that you know
[03:15:05] you just woke up you're not warm you may or may not have you know worked out did some training
[03:15:09] whatever so you kind of got to exercise like perfect form to stand up with this little girl who's
[03:15:15] moving on your on your back otherwise you get injured so after it was about six days of taking krill oil
[03:15:22] I didn't have to like it was like I was already warm that was the feeling that's what it did
[03:15:27] that's cool but why do I listen to jocco and take krill oil and not my father and law
[03:15:34] well he's telling me the same stuff you know often having an example instead of being told is more
[03:15:39] effective you know and there's a confidence I think that goes along with someone doing something
[03:15:44] and not telling you about it yeah yeah you've been psychologically unwound I think
[03:15:51] they're still alright well nonetheless so on top of that jocco as his own krill oil so you know that's
[03:15:57] the good one super krill not just regular super by the way also joint warfare which is a bunch of
[03:16:03] other ingredient is that glucose to mean yeah yeah super cool you got the perfect formula for joint
[03:16:12] sustainable joint maintenance and health perfection that's from origin origin lab so origin main
[03:16:19] dot com on the top menu lab spoon that's where you get it is there like I think there's like
[03:16:25] anyway there's a link on the story anyway there needs to be link on our store there is yeah there's
[03:16:29] room right there whatever you need also geese and rash guards if you introduce the
[03:16:35] integer to Jordan Peterson I'm not I'm not Brazilian you just know it's not very not there's not

[03:18:56] terror macew is pretty delicious and Montreal has excellent restaurants I wish I remember the
[03:19:00] name of the place I'd go back there yeah but I don't actually did find that that month we went to a

[03:20:35] yeah you're not allowed to do that I'm not saying I'm legit for doing it even though I am but that's
[03:20:41] not what I'm saying okay I'm saying certainly something like you proclaimed yourself and as legit
[03:20:46] just a violation so make that disclaimer that's not what I mean it's not the point the point is
[03:20:51] my set of kettlebells is legit chimp double chimp where wolf double wear wolf gorilla double

[03:21:08] eight years I know man two pounds heavier every rep two by the way there's the legit part yeah
[03:21:17] every rep though every set every rep two more pounds boom over time that is legit also
[03:21:23] when you get maps of meaning by doctor Jordan B Peterson all listed on the website talk about
[03:21:30] cast.com all listed on that website books click through there that's a good way to support
[03:21:35] and think you're a Amazon and twelve rules for life yeah oh yeah you can pre-order that one yes yes yes yes
[03:21:41] yeah it's doing pretty well in pre-order yeah sold about four thousand copies in pre-orders
[03:21:45] nice boom yeah hey yeah we'll double that number when this podcast comes out
[03:21:50] had be good that'd be good the colder so yeah many people that's what's cool is people
[03:21:55] that listen this podcast they read we read books all the time yeah they read the books they buy the
[03:21:59] books that's it's it's awesome oh well I should say too then I have a booklist on my website on
[03:22:05] JordanB Peterson.com okay yeah it's a book of recommended readings and so if you want to
[03:22:11] well I mean the books that had a huge impact on me well ordinary man is right ordinary man is one
[03:22:16] of them and the rape of nand King as well yeah which is a we did a podcast a rape of a
[03:22:21] case that's a lot of man you would be very interested in the fall on book to that which is called
[03:22:26] the woman who cared too much which is written by Iris Changs. Right right yeah I know I
[03:22:32] was committed to a survey yeah well no wonder after investigating that and being harassed for it
[03:22:37] it's not surprising. Yeah and it seemed like her mom thought it was a lot to do with the
[03:22:42] drugs she'd been prescribed and going on and off drugs and apparently you shouldn't just stop
[03:22:49] taking one drug and start on some other drug apparently she would they were she was being directed
[03:22:54] to do that and it was negatively impactful at least according to what her mom thought so what
[03:23:00] of what a travesty that was. Yeah yeah I'm sure that your booklist and our booklist is probably
[03:23:06] has a lot of overlap. So it's like basically all the books you're talking about we already covered
[03:23:11] like we already covered the out not seeing that but you know like we're familiar with it because
[03:23:15] it's on the same list. Yeah a lot of overlap but yeah. Well I've looked at your list and it's that
[03:23:19] is actually not a lot of overlap. There's a I mean you obviously have a ton of books on there that
[03:23:24] that a lot of people would be interested in reading that I haven't covered yet. So
[03:23:30] perhaps we will do some of them actually. Yeah so yeah but yeah well these are going to be on
[03:23:35] that list again go to jokabotcast.com on the top little tab that says books from the episode and
[03:23:41] I got it listed by episode sometimes multiple books per episode by the way. So yeah go through
[03:23:47] that's a good way to support click through there and get those books from Amazon and if you
[03:23:52] do other Amazon shopping hey carry on do that too good way to support also subscribe to the podcast
[03:23:58] if you haven't already seems obvious I know but if you haven't film subscribe to good way to support
[03:24:03] also on YouTube like we talked about we only have one channel Jordan B Peterson S2 that's good
[03:24:10] maybe a good idea though because they go to certain channels for certain things. Yeah you know
[03:24:14] I mean well it's not obvious too what the optimal lengths of a YouTube video is you know different
[03:24:19] lengths serve different functions. Yeah and different experts will give you differences with that.
[03:24:24] Very interesting hey do you ever listen you know how you you've mentioned that people get your
[03:24:28] your like little clips of your talks they'll make their own videos you put some music on there you know
[03:24:35] they do that with a lot they obviously they do that you ever like go on there and just kind of watch them
[03:24:39] and be like hey never really really felt it like that you know with that in music. Yeah what's really interesting
[03:24:44] interesting people do with it. I made juggle watch mine yeah that's fine that good we made
[03:24:50] a head this little thing but the expression good so it's like alright let me me make a video made one
[03:24:57] of those made a match it but he liked it. Somebody made a video where they put me through one of those
[03:25:03] gadgets that auto tunes you're working. Yeah I was talking about cats and rats and so it's like
[03:25:08] this sort of rap video. Yeah yeah it's ridiculous you know it's ridiculous but it's kind of
[03:25:14] goked up. I don't know what to think about. Got 500 thousand views. Yeah it's cool right so you
[03:25:21] know what I mean my buddy retweeted something that I was telling about this you retweeted you retweeted
[03:25:28] it's some it's some computer sorting something sorting numbers yeah and you just watch this thing
[03:25:34] sort and you get posted two or three of them and I watched all three of them and it's just kind of funny
[03:25:40] that how do we get to a place where we're watching a computer sort things and it's well first
[03:25:45] of a why is that on YouTube in the first place and I'm sitting there watching it and I'm
[03:25:50] I'm a person that that constantly tells people don't waste your time on YouTube videos and
[03:25:56] there I was watching you know three 45 second YouTube videos of numbers being sorted. They're
[03:26:02] pudig, right like that kind of like to see things being sorted. Yeah we're like you've seen
[03:26:07] those big domino patterns you know that they've met and they just have a video of it and you're
[03:26:11] just watching the domino pattern you know it's kind of the same. Well we've actually actually
[03:26:15] I feel bad now we failed to talk about sort yourself out today we didn't even use the word
[03:26:20] sort until right now that's a real that's a real mistake on my part yeah you know for those of you
[03:26:27] well you'll find this as you get into Jordan's work you'll see that he talks about sorting
[03:26:34] yourself out and how that's what you need to do is sort yourself out. Yes and that's become a that's
[03:26:38] become a meme I guess you can buy it on t-shirts and all sorts of things so that and clean your room
[03:26:44] which is yeah which is I really think that's so funny it's so it's so absurd so much of what's
[03:26:49] happened in the last year has been surreal and absurd but that's certainly one of them. You want to
[03:26:54] talk about absurd the other day I was um had my daughter cleaning her room and I was playing a
[03:27:01] gel-joon-peeders clip of you telling people to clean their lives I'm falling around her room
[03:27:07] and she's getting so mad at me but I thought it was fun and then and then she told me yesterday
[03:27:15] that she had had a conversation with her friends about torturous things and mean things that their
[03:27:20] parents have done and that is what she's for me that's probably her out of the room. Music me as an
[03:27:25] instrument of torturous kind of culture you are there now. I can understand that I can understand that
[03:27:32] but those YouTube clips like like how you say they made the rap video right yeah so I like to
[03:27:38] like me my brother would always start a heat always say that what people do when they add the music
[03:27:43] to your voice it almost gives it like this um you know like when it's might be a crude comparison
[03:27:50] but you know how like dogs you got to give them their medicine but you got to put in the food you know
[03:27:54] so it's kind of that you know like okay you know this University of Toronto professor I get it
[03:28:00] maybe other people might not get it because it's just this quote unquote boring lecture but
[03:28:04] let me put some cool music behind it. Yeah well and I think people are doing that because they do
[03:28:08] find something you know they find a statement or two that hits them and so yes and they like to play
[03:28:12] with it as far as I'm concerned like more power to them it's really interesting to see how that
[03:28:17] multiplies out you know it's it's been fascinating to watch that. I made a degree into
[03:28:23] an artist a rap artist made a song the song is called two free and it's a guy rapping and I
[03:28:32] forget his name right now I apologize but he's rapping and then the song like his rapping fades out
[03:28:39] and an income's me talking about discipline equals freedom in the middle of his rap song actually
[03:28:43] it's at it's like the last minute of his rap song thing and I was going back and forth with him
[03:28:48] on Twitter and he's like yeah man I really dug what you said I heard it on JRE. Yeah yeah so you're like a
[03:28:53] rapper. Yeah that's what he's yeah you're not the rapper to though. No you guys both are straight up
[03:28:59] rap artists. rapper poet. Opera. Bad ass. Oh that's legit right there nonetheless YouTube
[03:29:09] that's a good way to to support subscribe you know jockel podcast the legitimate jockel podcast though
[03:29:15] because there could be fake accounts I remember there were oh but yeah YouTube channel that's
[03:29:23] really right you see actually it's not very hard to distinguish at this point nonetheless good
[03:29:27] way to subscribe also jockel as a store it's called jockel store it's a cool name right it is also
[03:29:34] like direct right to the point the whole deal yeah and just like just like then even
[03:29:40] about why I have the Jordan B. Peterson part of this like oh you see you
[03:29:45] you scored high and openness. Exactly I really have just scratched my head over that one
[03:29:50] you're doing the same boat. Yeah but it is a legit store nonetheless still a basic store but what we
[03:29:56] got in there got some shirts some rash guards for jutsu and surfing actually for pretty
[03:30:01] much any physical activity cycling whatever also some women stuff on there and hats
[03:30:08] hoodies are out for the winter yeah so he's from Canada he needs legit yeah he
[03:30:13] made too he's from Hawaii yeah he's not he's from Hawaii and last hoodies that he made were
[03:30:19] thinner than your shirt that you're wearing right now they're inappropriate as hoodies so he beefed
[03:30:24] it up again this year slight exaggeration but true nonetheless so yeah they're they're thicker hoodies
[03:30:28] for sure and they're in some patches on there again some women stuff for you know the lady
[03:30:34] troopers too after it so yeah should be all good on there some new stuff coming out
[03:30:41] I'm gonna let you guys wait on what those things are. Anyway jockels door.com that's a good
[03:30:47] that's a good idea but get to this big thing you know there's four people that are waiting
[03:30:52] to know that next thing I'm just saying that's who I'm talking to boom anyway it's called jockels
[03:30:57] start.com easy to remember also okay so psychological warfare tell you what that is make sense too
[03:31:05] so when you're on the path that's what we're calling right the path yeah discipline right
[03:31:12] I want to you know like okay I'm gonna check you gotta keep doing that stuff you know you can't
[03:31:15] just be like I'm gonna quit drinking and then just quit drinking for one day you gotta do it for
[03:31:19] good but some days you find that it's like hard like let's say I'm gonna wake up 430 in the
[03:31:25] morning every morning now for the rest of my life one day it's gonna be like I can't do um
[03:31:30] hit snooze but now psychological warfare it's an album with tracks you can get on iTunes whatever
[03:31:38] and each track is for each little weakness that might come up. So let's say you're about to wake
[03:31:44] up you want to hit the snooze instead of the snooze psychological warfare get up and get after it
[03:31:49] that's the name of the track it'll have jockel telling you pragmatically why you shouldn't do that
[03:31:56] why you should stay strong stay on it stay on the path you can't paint against weakness and also
[03:32:02] you know it's it goes for a bunch of stuff like um you want to skip the workout that day or
[03:32:07] your procrastinating you know I'm gonna leave it for tomorrow whatever create a block all that stuff
[03:32:12] anyway it's called psychological warfare check it out see if that you it see if any one or more of the
[03:32:18] tracks addresses your potential weakness on your path that's what it's for and that by the way that
[03:32:26] that album was the number one spoken word album for something like nine months and it was only recently
[03:32:34] on this is on iTunes it was only recently overtaken by another album that's called the Discipline
[03:32:41] equals freedom field manual what is it audio version which is now on iTunes and Amazon music and
[03:32:49] Google play and other did you read it yes you did yes yeah because I've been thinking about reading my
[03:32:55] new book oh you absolutely should I read this yeah I read this with my buddy life
[03:33:00] and this book the kids book way the warrior kid my son read oh yeah he read the kid and I read Uncle
[03:33:07] Jake so I have fun with that kind of thing also when your an Amazon you can get chocolate which
[03:33:14] you may want to try it do you ever deadlift weights yeah okay this will give you a minimum deadlift
[03:33:20] of 8000 pounds if you drink chocolate oh yeah that's a lot yeah it's guaranteed it's like that
[03:33:26] to let 1000 pounds more than I've ever been able to deadlift well there you go you're stuck at
[03:33:31] that 7000 pounds how many pounds you need to get to 8000 chocolate weight to it will get you there
[03:33:37] 100% also on Amazon obviously we got the books Jordan's books maps of meaning and 12 rules for
[03:33:44] life pre-order it the thing that this is what's gonna happen and I had to warn people that was
[03:33:48] gonna happen and it's gonna happen to your book too your publisher doesn't understand what's happening
[03:33:53] they don't understand YouTube they don't understand your podcast they don't understand this podcast
[03:33:57] they don't understand Joe Rogan's podcast they don't understand that and so they're printing books
[03:34:01] and they think oh yeah we think it's gonna do okay the book is gonna sell out so if people don't
[03:34:06] pre-order the book they won't get there's two things first of all they won't get it when it comes
[03:34:10] out and second of all they won't get the first edition copy which is kind of like if you're a book
[03:34:15] guy you want that thing you want it to be first edition okay that's good so if you want his book
[03:34:20] which you do pre-order it do it now um way the warrior kid if you want to put your kid if you want
[03:34:27] to sort your kid out and put them on the proper path the proper path get them book way the warrior
[03:34:33] kid you said you read it yeah okay yeah it's funny I use that term too and my my book the proper path
[03:34:39] my editor asked me quite repetitively I'd say what exactly what I meant by that but it's you know
[03:34:46] sort of implicit in the book but proper is the right word for that for some reason it's even though
[03:34:52] it's kind of an old word in some ways old fashioned word that's okay there's a lot of old
[03:34:57] fashioned words that we could put that we could use again agree and I wrote this book because
[03:35:01] all the books that were out there for kids were telling them that there was okay to be weak
[03:35:06] and that it was okay to do bad in school yeah maybe they weren't smart enough to know
[03:35:12] their time stables and all these some maybe it's okay if you're scared of the water maybe you should
[03:35:16] just stay away from the water it's a no no no and no right you want okay yeah it's not okay to be like that
[03:35:23] it's but it is okay to be strong and it is okay to study hard and work hard it is okay to face
[03:35:28] your fears yeah it's okay to stand up to the bully it's okay to do those things it's proper
[03:35:33] to do yes that's right well that's the problem with that damn self esteem movement it's like
[03:35:39] you know they what you're supposed to be telling kids is that who you are is more important
[03:35:43] who you could be is more important than who you are because you're living it's like what are
[03:35:48] you live in for you know if you're already everything you should be it's like well you know
[03:35:52] you're done so what good is it growing up that's not helpful it's like you say look man
[03:35:59] you're full of potential there's there's worlds out there to conquer there's things to do
[03:36:03] there's people to help there's things to put right get the hell together get it together
[03:36:08] and don't let your fears stop you as opposed to everything is great and you're you're this
[03:36:12] wonderful child why would you want to then burn yourself with a bunch of response people
[03:36:16] I would do that doesn't make any sense I'm already good to go yeah right no unburden me
[03:36:21] well and the kids know that's not true because they're not like and well people in general know
[03:36:26] this because they're not satisfied with their life they have a feeling that there's got to be more
[03:36:33] well there is more but the more isn't by radical self-acceptance of all your pathetic flaws
[03:36:45] extreme ownership another book you can get it's about personal responsibility and how that will
[03:36:50] make you win as a leader so get that book if you don't have it yet and if you don't have if you
[03:36:56] have it and you want your team to be better get the book for your team so that they start taking
[03:37:00] ownership of the problems and and then the problems start getting solved discipline equals freedom
[03:37:05] field manual it's out thanks to everyone that bought it and made it into a best seller
[03:37:12] a New York Times best seller a Wall Street Journal best seller those things are cool guess what
[03:37:17] appreciated appreciate all you out there buying the book spreading a word
[03:37:22] all everyone that sent pictures of 12 books stacked up that you're buying for everyone on your
[03:37:29] team or everyone you know or you're buying them for Christmas and your dad and your uncle thank
[03:37:33] you for doing that because not only to help the book do well and continue to help the book do well
[03:37:39] it's also going to help those people out in my opinion not that everyone's going to get it some
[03:37:44] people are going to go this book is stupid impossible you know and what we talked about earlier some
[03:37:50] people read the book and they go I already knew that well of course you did but why didn't you do it
[03:37:54] you why didn't you do it because someone obviously thinks you need to do it so okay you get it that's
[03:38:03] fine you know what you're supposed to do guess what we all know we're supposed to do we all know what's
[03:38:07] going to improve our station in life and what's going to make it worse why aren't you doing the
[03:38:11] things that you're supposed to do question I don't know now you got to make it actually do you want
[03:38:17] to know why could you lack the discipline you lack the discipline to do the things you know
[03:38:21] you're supposed to do don't all you might also lack the fear so it actually matters if you don't
[03:38:28] do it you know matters if you leave things undone you leave the world in an uncompleted state
[03:38:33] and it hurts it hurts you it hurts your family it hurts your society and it hurts the world
[03:38:38] so if you're laying there being useless and not getting out it then you're contributing to the
[03:38:44] catastrophe and it's that simple so it actually matters if you do it and I think sometimes people
[03:38:50] don't do it because they don't understand that you know they're they're down on themselves they
[03:38:54] don't think they matter it's like you matter a lot more than you think you you do and actually
[03:38:59] that's rather frightening you know because you think well wouldn't be nice if everybody mattered it's
[03:39:03] like you got to think that through if what you do matters you better look out so get out it because
[03:39:10] you're going to pay for it if you don't so
[03:39:16] um thank you yes I I obviously agree that and and a lot of people have been asking for the
[03:39:21] audio version and like I said it's on the MP3 platforms it's on Google Play iTunes Amazon
[03:39:27] Boop music Spotify yes Spotify I think you can ask you Alexa to play it right if you have
[03:39:32] that digital thing in your yeah that if it's on Amazon music I think it automatically does

[03:41:02] being out there thanks for spreading a positive message again very aligned with what I say
[03:41:08] you're coming at people from a different angle than I come from but that message I think is going

[03:41:20] I know that you are working hard to make this happen and I truly appreciate the fact that you
[03:41:27] are doing that so it doesn't it doesn't seem like there's anything better to do well you know
[03:41:33] yeah yeah that's kind of it seems like a basic truth doesn't it it's like there are things that
[03:41:39] aren't so good we could probably fix most of them so like what you got something better to do
[03:41:45] than that doesn't seem like it but that's at least have a good shot at it yeah right exactly exactly
[03:41:52] and to the people that make this podcast possible and that is the soldiers sailors, airman and
[03:41:59] Marines on the front lines who protect all right to free speech those folks that are living out
[03:42:09] the archetype of the hero they're out there fighting the dragon and killing the snakes and

[03:42:36] there are snakes and there are dragons and there are depraved human beings and pathologies that can
[03:42:43] rip you apart but there is also your world that you control and you have the ability to stand up
[03:42:55] against evil and against those snakes in your own way and make your world a better place
[03:43:04] so stand up and get after it so until next time this is Dr. Jordan Peterson and echo and
