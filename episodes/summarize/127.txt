Nonetheless, like if I tell you, like, oh, this works for me and like legitimately, if you're a skeptic of the whole deal, like if you're like, I don't know if this works, then the scientific, like, well, for some reason, And so, a corpsman, he said he didn't know whether to believe that corpsman or not, but they sent him up to tell him a cargon, and there's, they had a blown station up, you know, they put big balloons up in the air, on cables, you know, protect areas, you know, military areas, the Japanese would probably suit if they tried to invade us. And I got down there and odd ferris took us to the right, threw them up and up there into the boat and hall got them to the Lord, little bit right there, thing and then odd ferris took us by our foot, you know, and he used to step on hall, put us on the end, and I got up here, or why they mean finally got there. Come on, let's face it, it's kind of like one of those things where it's like, it's a justification, but it's like, uh, like, Hey, you shouldn't put so much pressure on yourself, you know, don't add this stress. Especially with people I know know, with people I know know To each zone, you know, I think most people who like caffeine there, like coffee and stuff, like they like that. She said, he said, he said, he said, he said, he said, he's sent within the Marine Corps. it, it, it, it, it, I, in my, the way it was born was because of a weakness that I specifically specifically had, like something that it kind of got to me late, you know, like later on. And so I'm like, all right, I got a, you know, I'm out of the game for a little bit, I got to get back in this quick as I can. And he got, that night, the Barcelona was, did his thing, and he was about 30 or 40 yards from Barcelona on that land, you know, and the shield hit him, sort of they took him off, and he had, a lot of those guys got malaria. And I don't know if they didn't ask anything of harm and, you know, it was always me they looking at, you know. And he did it like it was just like, you know, like taking a breath. So I do have a basic comparison because like you said like we know, I had the exact same injury, exact same injury on the other side, same surgery, same everything. I just going too hard, you know, at the time one was an tournament, which obviously makes sense because you're After it and the other time I was just got too excited training with the training partner, I've been training with for a long time. And I know that's what helped me because when I got hurt, I was, I knew what was going on, and knew what I had to do, but I still just scared it like it be. Of course, anyway, we were all, then, and one of the guys in my group was walked around and, and golfing with everything, you know, on the island, and it's got name Lucas, in my group, when we walked around, he looked at, he said, there's my cousin over there. And it was just breaking out, you know, kind of like I always started kind of like athletes, foot all with their whole body. Well, you know, when you're floating along there, you're going up and down first thing, you know, but it's in the water and it comes by kelanda. Yeah, it's kind of like, it's kind of like, if I have like, it's a metaphor right now. Nine years ago, by the way, I wasn't like I'm older now, so that's something to, so this recovery, like given right now is like way quicker. You know, someone's like, oh, you got to take your probiotics, right? But when you extend it to this flat, you still kind of have that strength in the muscle, but down there, it's like, I don't know, it's like the stability of the structure just isn't as much enough. And, you know, even if, even if you don't like the taste, even if you don't, I like that it's good for you. Like, I rolled with Pete, like, you know, the entire, yeah. We didn't know where we were going, you know. Well, we got back, they took us, we got back on a destroyer and was headed back in to, to, impasse a ghost's bay that was on Bogotap, that's where we invaded, if set up a, air strip, you know, to attack New Guinea. I can't roll, probably with like, you know, like, um, level 12. And so, we went to shore, we anchored out Pearl Harbor, you know, and they gave us three or four hours leave off the ships, you know. But it's the kind where like if I didn't feel like working out, it's like, I just kind of won't work out. If I said, oh, I don't know because I don't feel like it. Because it doesn't taste like you know, you use, like, um, sweeteners. You know, we liked listening to her, because she played good music, you know, and she's supposed to be breaking our boat morale down, but she doesn't have a normal morale. and I said people don't know what the depression was really like Did you guys know what the intelligence that you got, paint the picture that E-Wo was going to be a really, really hard fight? And that's when I, when we got back, I was, I had what they call the, the crud, you know, broke out all over the body, just like having athletes foot on the whole body. And the head, you know, the Navy and the Marine Corps, the bathroom is called the head, you know. They got to me and said, he said, take this guy in first, take him right on the end. And he, he, spirits rose, you know, and of course, you couldn't tell us that, you know, but you could tell about his actions and everything. And that bullet hit at that above us, you know, that was the only she could get, you know, and we were safe at that long as we stayed down. Yeah, we were on the board ship for, well, we got a board ship, and we sailed around, and we went and made a couple of practice landings in those islands and Hawaii, you know. It's just like, you know, you just gotta get it. It's like you're injured, you're injured, you're gonna this and that because I'm just like cruising, tick off the slaying or whatever, who's around lifting weights, not with this arm, just like it in that action kind of doing push-ups. So I said, I know, I want my boots, I want my boots, and so he took him off Well, she said, well, I hear that the Marines, she always said, well, the little Marines are gonna be hitting one of our islands soon, and she said, the better brain there, yes, mass. And he said, I don't know how in the world they got you down here. I cried under shame, you know, because they made a lot to me, you know. And they sent a corpsman back with him, you know, he was put on a merchant ship, he was going back, it wasn't a Navy ship, it was all the merchant ship, it was going back. And he said, you don't know how you got down here. I said, no, I don't know how I got down here. And then I went out and the next thing I know I'm being put on a board, I was in the LST, I below an LST and they were going to take me off that board with four of the guys with a platform on cable. You know, I'm not telling my aunt, you know, and we became close friends.
