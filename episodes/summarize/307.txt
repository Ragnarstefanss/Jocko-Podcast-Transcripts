There's a there's a note about this Raven's assessment so somebody kind of read that big assessment of San Hirsten and this guy says I read Simon Ravens paper with great interest when you when you ask from my comments you must bear in mind that in 1898 when I was gazetted I joined a totally different type of army from that of today it was an aristocratic army feudal in the sense that it was grounded on leadership and fall and fellowship in which with few exceptions the leaders were the sons of gentlemen and more frequently than not the eldest sons the most privileged sons when I went to San Hirst we were not taught to behave like gentlemen because it never occurred to anyone that we should behave otherwise we were taught a lot of obsolete tactics in every army the of that day did a tremendous lot of useless drill but never heard a word about responsibility, loyalty, guts, et cetera because so I suppose these were held to be the natural prerequisites of gentlemen so this is back in the day when it's like hey man you better act like this you you're upholding the family named the men the followers of that period were a rough lot simple tough alliterate largely recruited from down melts men who had a lot met who met who had gotten a lot of trouble vagabonds and a sprinkling of the grand sons and grandsons sons of nCOs and private soldiers military families who generally became nCOs they were therefore two distinct classes really cast by birth on the whole the men looked up to their officers whether they were a fission or insufficient or inefficient and the officers did not look down on their men why should they so he was saying like this was just kind of the way it was back then the idea of an officer imposing on his imposing his will on his men never entered his head because one class was so superior and the other so inferior that it was unnecessary to do this there wasn't even any opposing ideas to what you were saying the superior could not lose cast should he play or mix with his men I remember this is a good story I remember on my first tour as an orderly officer on the QMS was late for the QMS mean the quartermaster so one of the sailors was late for meat issue and I thought he had risked it because I was a novice so I put him under arrest when this was reported to the agitant he took me aside and said strictly speaking you were right but actually speaking you weren't ass so don't do it again and I didn't so he like punished this guy trying to prove that he was pretty said hey bro what are you knowing you you technically you could do that but that's not the way you treat your people of the present day democratic army I my total flight time was nine seconds just hope that I just cry out if you got to know enough 35 right now in the simulator I could over the shoulder you walk you through to you landed almost perfectly in the first drawing well that's like drones man those first drones came out that were like little model airplanes guys were just crashing everywhere and now a three year old confide drone and that's that's no such technology uh this thing says on the same note the net result would be a bi-modal distribution of officers at every grade so these two different types of officers you end up with them at every grade those who take risks and get away with it the Montgomerys and Lawrence is up this of this world and those who have plotted up the hard but safe way the good old boys you never speak out a turn who make up intact and conformity what they lack in enterprise and initiative interesting contemplation of a nept commander suggests that they were of the latter genre in the first place they were renowned almost without exception for being hypersensitive to criticism so those people that are the the the conformists high-percentive asked the question of physical bravery and no way to track from the feats of courage to note that the fear of being afraid the fear of social disemprovele for cowardice and most important the personal shame attendant upon flinching in the face of danger could drive a man to perform acts of valor far beyond the normal call of duty this is not to deny that bravery occurs for other reasons out of pure altruism or patriotism but merely that some individuals are so lacking in self-esteem that they will gladly exchange the fear of failure for their own physical destruction that's kind of a weird thing to say in a very real sense military organizations recognize and trade upon this fact of human nature death rather than dishonor is no empty platitude but formulates an essential and ancient feature of military i'll tell you what's a you would expand a little bit more which he doesn't what's scary about that is when people are being brave with other people's lives that that's what's jacked up look if you're brave and you go and do something heroic good on you i don't care what your motivation was i think same harris always talks about the fact that you can't you can't fake bravery right you run out in the street there's no fake in it so yes tell me what you think final spin it's available right now order it let me know what you think we're in strategy tactics field manual the code the evaluation protocols which i wrote with davour saran strong this week was freedom field manual way the warrior kid one two three and four mic in the

Dave is at David our Burke echelon aquatrols and i am at jockel willink and to all the troops out there around the world and all at all those forgotten barricades thank you for the holding the line to protect those of us here at home and to our police law enforcement firefighters paramedics EMTs dispatchers correction officers board patrol secret service secret service and all first responders thank you for holding the line to keep us safe here on the home front and everyone else out there let me just remind you of that quote from Francis bacon why should a man be in love with his feathers though of a gold what's trapping you what's controlling you what's controlling your thoughts your ideas your beliefs what's controlling your mind and the things that are controlling you they might seem good they might be made of gold but they aren't slaving you nonetheless do not let that happen cast off those mental manacles and think for yourself and until next time this is Dave and echo and jockel out maybe I know you're not getting promoted but it did happen there are grounds for thinking that incompetent commanders tend to be those whom the need to avoid failure exceeds the urge to succeed according to JWAK and T-feather such people tend to issue activities which they may show up in a poor light and unless forced to so refrain from taking on any skilled task where there are any doubts about the outcome so people that are just concerned about themselves they'll only go into jobs where they know they're going to win that's what they're trying to do they're just they're only doing jobs of things that they know they're going to do if no one's going to win that here in lies especially lemma though they need to achieve it is the very nature of trying which exposes them to that which they fear most failure they are like people who try to climb mountains out of an underlying fear of heights it would not be surprising to find that such people are attracted to and prosper in the armed services for one place it carefully in the military and contrast the world of commerce offers achievement without tears stick to the rule book do nothing while explicit approval from the next higher up always confirm form never offend your superiors and you will float serenely if a trifle slowly upward a blip in both senses of the word that's the reality you can you there you can do that you can join the military and you can just kind of keep your nose clean stay low profile don't take any additional risks conform Is there anything in, I guess in the battlefield, it might be more black and white, but like in training or something like that where it's like maybe something optional or something that people don't want to wear or do that's for safety reasons, but it's like, it's like, it's not cool or it's like, you would ever sweat like that. right so like like like like Muhammad Ali right when he'd they'd be like oh how many situps do he's like I don't know him any situps they do because it only come I only start counting when it starts to hurt right but when you start being brave with other people's lives that's a freaking disaster that's what these horrible leaders end up doing it cannot be emphasized too strong only that this suggested relationship between valor and the need to prove oneself a no way to base his bravery on the contrary takes the view that the best measure of courage is the fear that is overcome then these were the bravest of them all for his only by conquering rational fear that they could nullify fear of being afraid so there you go the tragedy of this issue is that if military organizations select their senior commanders for their physical as opposed to moral bravery they not only might ignore other equally important attributes but are bound to select a proportion of individuals whose underlying psychopathology is quite unfitted to positions of high command in this way they invite incompetence so just because someone's brave doesn't mean you want to put them in a leadership position doesn't say you don't want them there and there is certainly a huge benefit to someone that's been in combat and knows what's happening knows the understands the emotions and and the human nature that takes place on the front lines for sure that's highly beneficial shouldn't be the only reason you select somebody though the last trait of those who harbour a fear of failure concerns the selection of subordinates they're really two components to this process the first concerns the way an individual sees himself in comparison with his competitors in the second the way he thinks others will see him in comparison with his contemporaries in either case he may well try to elevate his own self estimation by choosing a low standard with which to make comparison hence the phenomenon of people who tend to shun the company of individuals more gifted and even choose workmates as select or select as subordinates people who may consider inferior to themselves a lot of freaking disaster that is so that's the person that wants to look good so hires a bunch of idiots talks a little bit about haig he talks about haig being painfully aware of his limitations haig was a world war one commander of burnish troops and then try to enter the one profession open to the dumps of the family of the army only to find that even nary failed to shine he got put into his position the reason he got promoted is because he got sort of a hook up from a family member his elder sister hen rea to new the Duke of Cambridge hooked him up with ventured entry to staff college then he was the aid to camp to the king do this guy's just making moves make and moves became respected for his conventional opinions that's Then there's like, and then there's a little transition period where it's like, yeah, if you know where your seat belts kind of like, ah, like what you scared, like kind of weaker whatever. yes what do you got that whole that part about like not taking risks of your failure like that kind of stuff like first of whatever reason it was making me think of like the jujitsu journey ascending with like getting belts and all this stuff so in the beginning yeah got out of the we've there's been a very small it's been a very safe airplane what is enough 35 cost at the time it was 130 million now it's probably 90 also they cut the price down well those first ones are like you know they were literally the very first ones off the assembly and so that that as you know like that mass production benefit hadn't continued so age one was kind of like a unique article now like their jammer amount they're making a bunch of them right so you think oh cool this is like a hierarchy set up that make sense I'm down I want to go in there because I'm an entrepreneur I'm a go getter sometimes it does in the case of wellington Montgomery rommel and zukov men with in order to lead strong needs for achievement all those guys wanted to do well unfortunately however there are aspects of a military career which are unlikely to attract people with high achievement motivation the fact that traditionally promotion depends upon seniority class wealth conformity and obedience may well leave them rather cold neither means nor the ends are sufficiently attractive so when you get a guy like Wellington like rommel they look and say okay and I think the thing I was thinking about and this is military I think in general there are enough jobs in the military that have been done enough times that the template is there that you know I can take those set orders and like man it's really low risk you know cookie cutter job that's been done I can take the template jocos going off to me here's the you know here's the script follow the script low profile low risk you're going to look good in the end but if you start let's say you get like I don't know purple about that feel like it's one of the benchmark balance right for sure kind of become that's like jujitsu puberty right there you know so a lot of people and it can vary from belt to belt for sure but the minute you you have that attitude and you start to impose it on people around you you need to check yourself you need to check yourself because you're shutting down mind your closing minds and you're really in the long term hurt in your organization you were come across a situation it feels like it's feels like it's real common where you get to people they're going to business together one guys risk averse one guys like freaking try anything and they sort of start to balance each other for sure and not to mention there's some jobs that are kind of more conducive for certain attitude types remember that there's some people that are out there for themselves and there's some people that are out there to try and do a good job he says compare Lawrence and this is Lawrence of Arabia compare Lawrence roughing it with his tiny Arab force on the 800 mile trek across the desert to west to to rest akaba from the Turks with towns and comfortably a sconce and his villa on the sea of mormara while his captured troops died in their thousands from exposure malnutrition and brutality the contrast in both cases in between the self imposed as sadism of high achievement motivation and the self indulgence of one concerned with professional excellence less concerned with professional excellence than with personal advantage pretty good stark difference between those two how is it that some of the criteria for promotion to military organizations are evidently such as to favor people with a pathological degree of achievement motivation this is scary the person that might have a tendency to get promoted is the one that's looking out for themselves in some cases in the military again isn't important to say this isn't like the entire military but certainly I certainly saw people in the military that were 100% looking out for themselves and they got promoted Second they accentuate the challenge of promotional ladder by making certain upward movements very difficult indeed third the ethos of the armed forces is such that such as to make advancement lovable and highly rewarding generals have every advantage bar that of age over those lower down on the ladder they are richer, safer and more comfortable their chances of collecting honors orders and nighthooks are imminently greater than those of more junior ranks finally even the most modest thirst for achievement is encouraged by training and convention the taboo on junior speaking to senior seniors in officer training establishments saluting and being saluted orders of march rules as to say as who says sir to whom all serve to emphasize the horizontal stratifications of military organizations besides adding lustre to each new level gained so that's what the military sets up this really nice place where you can kind of you see what the game is and if you don't want to play the game you're going to get you're going to get satisfaction unfortunately there are aspects of military career which are unlikely to attract people with high achievement motivation and he says this at first sight these arguments would seem to suggest that the possibility of promotion in the military organization would attract those with a potential for achievement go getters entrepreneurs innovators and men with energy and drive in short people who would make first class military commanders and and you're right in saying like that's part of the system is is you have you might show for this altruism of how it works and the wrong people get promoted sometimes now it's not a lot of those people's actually a small number like you said but it happens enough that you will see it you're not going to go a career and go oh I never saw that every single time it was the right person of the right reasons I I wonder we that park is it's just a different world this is the different situation and they court sort of had this pre-existing system that was in place now what kind of makes me disturbed about this is you know he's he's basically talking about how great the gentleman were of the day but these were the gentleman that freaking acted like idiots leading their troops to be killed so there wasn't so much honor and principle as he's talking about close now this section he says from a general study of leadership it seems there is much in military organizations to invite incompetence officers are selected for the wrong reasons required to fulfill in compatible roles and expected to function adequately in a communication system of dubious efficiency at higher levels of command they are protected from adverse criticism by their invisibility and by the plain fact that in times of stress even the poorest leaders like drunken fathers and rabbits feet are clung to with pathetic if misplaced dependency so you gotta be like a certain limited amount of gas so the plane is light enough to hover but then again like you can't just sit there all day long because you don't have that much gas it's nothing like the hair year was those guys it was sketchy like yes it can can it then provide opportunities for people to sort of just get on board with the system yes it can does the civilian sector do that as well how yes it does happens in any leadership situation where we take these things that we should be striving for like freedom of expression and unfettered cognitive processes meaning you should just be able to think and we crush them and you know I was thinking this uh we've been talking about the the the EO leadership loop and included not as the is the Udlu right these ideas of constantly running through your mind all these different aspects of leadership and the main list lesson that you and I put out this is what we've just put out the monster the main lesson when you're running these loops is not to get stuck is not to get stuck is to free your mind and that's how I close out the last podcast you know like if you don't know if you're not in the know you go you you you have a awesome selection you know you know that the orange is going to come through wouldn't you agree I don't like that I feel like I don't like it either I feel like I do I take offense to it maybe maybe The complaint was like, oh, it's the tactile like I want to press the buttons and turn the knobs and it's harder to feel and like, can you know, can you cut the fingertips off? i think i said something i really flip it like trust me or like i know where where did i don't like to use Yeah, it's like, I don't kind of think, I remember, okay, you know, all you have entrepreneurs, and then you have like employee types, right? I sure a little of my specific but you can kind of see it where you know if you're focused on the belt you tend to be more like fear failure kind of approach to training and but if you're just like hey I'm in here to get better and learn and be humble take risks you would happen all this stuff compete it's live finally what do you think it's gonna what do you think the reviews are going to say hey what's your review people know my review i think i've talked about it my review is good i think the mass reviews going to be good i have a personal interest in this one because this is one of the few times who you shared with me and i i don't like i don't i don't take positions all that often in my position was immediately like this is going to be awesome and my validation for that was it what i thought of it is i gave it to my wife and she read the whole thing straight through and i'm like bro I know these are crazy numbers but at the time they were they were expensive 133 a copy I had 14 and if you when you find an f 35 and you're doing a vertical how often did you a vertical take off like a short take off like the stole like the I know next to nothing like the older aristocratic one it must have its good points and is probably more efficient but to me it is a folly to try and mix the two a gentleman is born and not made it is probably true that it takes three generations to fashion one and so it would appear for Mr. Ravens experiences if you try and make them synthetically you get neither an aristocrat or a democracy one sees this everywhere today among the rich the poor on the roads and in the factories I repeat it again gentleman are not turned out like sausages they are turned they are men of ingrained honor of principle and of decent behavior and some of the finest I have met in my long life had the long to the humblest classes because this cast rather than class is becoming extinct in my home opinion one of the great factors at the bottom of the present world turmoil and that's from JFC follower crazy right you've become respected because you agree with everybody that's a great point king that's a hundred percent right king he said things like cavalry will have a larger sphere of action future wars artillery only seems to be really effective against raw troops these are just idiotic statements he also had a he was also prone to a steady denigration of his competitors and the removal of his superior care of superior commanders this guy was just a shit talker haig haig talent for finding fault with everybody but himself was particularly keen whenever results had resulted in military setback and he gives all these just crazy examples uh he put he blamed someone he's unfit to command a division at this critical purity of the operations in France and should only be employed at home by the way there's a people that are working for him by the way ralson is unsatisfactory loyalty to his subordinates And then they'd always show like these videos of like post-dejection trauma to your hands or fingers getting literally, they'd call it getting declerved when your skin would come off your hand and leave the bone behind that pictures of guys exiting the cockpit on ejections and stuff or getting burn and things like that. Yeah, it's like the like, okay, like the seasoned guy is calling the new guys sir or whatever. and you're going to get promoted there there are those jobs out there I was lucky in my career to have jobs that either I've never been done before or really that it wasn't a lot of history behind them so you know I'm remembering a couple times like when I was in command of an organization where you know I was being told hey if this fails it's going to destroy the whole thing One person that wants to do a good job and one's person that just scared to fail whereas the former achieves out of a quest of excellence in his job the latter achieves by any means available not necessarily because of any sincere devotion to the work but because of the status social promotion or social approval and reduction of doubts about the self that's such achievement brings applying these distinctions to the military would seem that senior commanders fall into two groups and I think this is actually pretty accurate those primarily concerned with improving their professional ability and those primarily concerned with self-betterment a fast forward a little bit research suggests that these two sorts of achievement motivation go along with certain other personality traits thus need achievement motivation towards professional excellence is accompanied by greater occupational and intellectual competence so this is a person that wants to get promoted for the right reasons greater occupational and intellectual competence that's what he wants a better memory for uncomplete a task and therefore a predisposition to finish something once the gun a preference when choosing working partners for successful strangers rather than unsuccessful friends that's one just the you crappy leaders always surround themselves with their crappy unsuccessful friends a great greater readiness to volunteer for psychological experiments greater activity in the institution or community of which they are a member oh I've got a conform I've got to be a yes man so all their entrepreneurial spirit is thrown out the window they don't they they're being forced to comply in order to get promoted so it doesn't really seem as attractive as they thought originally was going to be moral for military types military has never smiled upon entrepreneurs and innovators the cut and thrust of private enterprise cleverness and even working too hard have not been deemed good form there is however another class of person for whom the military might well be an attractive proposition these are people who achievement motivation is pathological in origin the crucial difference between the two sorts of achievement the healthy and the pathological may be summarized by saying that whereas the first is buoyed up by hopes of success the second is driven by fear of failure. and and I understand the the aversion to that like hey would rather have a guaranteed win with you know a guaranteed marginal win with no chance of losing or high risk of failure but this is a once in a lifetime thing that would need the right person the right time to go through that a lot of people are averse to that it's that last you know like you're you're lifting you get to you get to deadlift for ninety five it takes a lot of work to get that last little bit right sure you're trying to cut your runtime down it takes a lot you get to you know a certain spot then takes a lot of work to get that it's really easy for you because you get to a certain spot I know that feeling of getting to like, officer candidate school in the basic school in flight school and like, oh, I don't want to look bad. The reason I wore gloves is like the first day of light school that guy was like, you will wear your gloves and like, okay, Roger that. so I get all the easy situps and you roll in the one in hurts and and bring this past the finish like there you go if you want to check that out and subscribe to my youtube channel do yeah also psychological warfare is like an album that we made back in the day for fundamental weaknesses that mental weaknesses that that we made stumble onto before we do workouts before we tricking cheat on diet eat some stuff that we don't want to be eating nonetheless these are moments of weakness that juggle helps us through why you can just listen to that he'll tell you why you should just stand the best in the path you know and that's such a good point because okay we can either fly as little as humanly possible which means everyone's paranoid no one really knows how to do job really like all right we're gonna fly these things we'll be awesome at it and that's the right call obviously not everyone would make that decision and even then they're still even the right call doesn't guarantee the outcome you go to everything Right, like three months into the basic school, you're like, you know what, if anything happens, I'm not going to run. So it's like, it's a lot of critic is kind of maybe for people who are, yeah, like that, right? There's a famous picture like the Gazette or whatever a magazine of a dude hand on the table like this who's wearing his wedding ring and his hands there, this whole thing has gone all this errors is the remaining piece of bone left on his hand, you know, trying to get people to wear gloves. And yeah, even inside that, just like you, and I think the order in which you said it is the right thing is if he called it like democratic, we all feel part of it. I guess you know hopefully we should be I'm just saying you know it's one of those things it does to keep you on the path we're reading mental physical or everything right we want to leave by example I'll tell you that I want to make good decisions until you that so all right on this path we're on this path good decisions physical capability mental capability we'll say you did not tell us what it is and you know we work with a lot of companies in echelon front and the leaders that have taken risk and have broken outside the norm those are leaders that they end up doing exceptionally well right if they manage it well like look you can take big risks you can fail right that happens that's why they're called risks but if you want to look can you play at safe And it's not, it's just basically saying like, I guess we would say like hyper, manly, like a manly man, he uses this term butch. the invisibility part he mentioned that and was talking about the fact that a lot of these senior leaders they just no one would see him you wouldn't see him on the front lines so they weren't getting criticism because they were they weren't around to be criticized mm-hmm military achievement besides providing legitimate outlets for aggression the gratification of obsessive tendencies and reassurances about virtual reality armies and navies also cater for another basic human motive the need to achieve they do this in several ways they embody related hierarchies of rank money and class so there's another thing that you can get by joining the military if you're a person that's driven to succeed you go in the military and you can get like a formatted way to move up the chain of command. And I only asked that because I remember that being a, like, long conversation with, with folks, not just on my team, but all the people who were with about not wearing eye pro out on missions, not the fogging and the sweat of that was standing, which I fully understandable and there's different ways, different ones to do it and do, didn't want to do it because they didn't like the way it looked. Like, it's kind of embarrassing, especially if you know the person in like, I'm even a little bit.
