and there's ways you can kind of do that to yourself like I do if like even if you have like an ultimately when when you boil kind of your whole way of thinking down when you do have an ego that you think is like a functional ego but use that ego to win the long word so like kind of like what I did with getting mad it's like no one can like my like no one's gonna tell me I have a little self esteem because really you know anger and grace is usually because a little self esteem so in this case you could be like hey if you ever facilitate that adversarial relationship where you don't shake his hand or you're like you want to as he said you've communicated that to him you have leader that you don't respect and you know is ineffective and you told them yeah that's that's a little bit different from what I was kind of saying but nonetheless if you go to on it dot com slash juggle you can get 10% off their their supplements anyway my point being with that story is that their supplements are all like legit and you can even read like about it like their peel oil I said this before I feel like I said this before but you can see like how they harvest them they use like eco friendly boats like it's like it's basically the ones you want to go boats but if you can afford to come out come on out because you being there is gonna make us all better because every single person that look I get so many responses on Twitter I get so many stuff so much stuff through through the social media that I'm learning from everyone here so anybody that can come out and participate and ask that question or give that scenario or give that piece of input is gonna make us all better so come on out and get some and as always if you want to continue this conversation you know where you can find us all up on the interwebs Twitter Instagram and that Facebookie bohaha it's echo at echo Charles and I am at Jocca Willink and finally to you to those of you out there in the battle our military guys you know I rack and in Syria fighting against a truly evil and abhorrent enemy stay sharp stay focused and be aggressive it'll keep you alive to the police officers who are suffering through a hard times right now verbal and physical attacks I'm gonna tell you take the high ground in both of those cases detach from that negativity and do your job to the best your ability be smart and stay safe and of course the firefighters and the emergency medical teams that keep us safe keep us healthy and come to us in our time of need you all stay vigilant and train hard and to the rest of you troopers out there all over the world doing what you are doing make sure you do that thing with every ounce of effort you got and make sure you stay on the war path and get after it so until next time this is echo and jockel out whoever does it you think needs to get on board with the program get him a copy that's kind of a good initiator form and also October 20th and 21st in San Diego we are having the extreme ownership mustard that is also life babbin and myself we're gonna be getting granular granular with the combat leadership lessons that we learned on the battlefield and how you apply those lessons in your business and in your life now that event is going to be extremely interactive it's more knocking behind behind the curtain we're gonna be out front with the troops if you got questions we are gonna answer them if you got something you need we're gonna talk about it if you got a problem we're gonna come up with a solution I say we because we we're gonna work together we're gonna learn I can't wait to see how much I'm gonna learn with the the list of people that are coming is awesome it and and again it's gonna be a hard conversation it's gonna bring out that statement should bring out the conversation of what people don't agree on and why they're sending messages now if you if you cannot get them aligned it is a serious problem but if you can't the best thing you can do is mitigate mitigate that to your team by becoming the trusted voice so so with your team you want to become the trusted voice now you doesn't mean that you're going to undermine your other leaders it's a echo came in here he doesn't know what he's talking about no no that's not what I'm talking about I'm never almost never talking about undermining another leader or a leadership team what I'm going to do though is I'm going to translate I'm gonna say hey guys our job on this I know echo said that here's our job here's here's what our focus needs to be here's the way this translates for us it's that's the interesting thing because you know like just kind of on the surface we're like a fuck what's jockel into it's not like you know something creates like something it looks like it sounds kind of delicate hey you're going to go here from six grade to graduation you go for like one year you go one year here you go back to your regular school after you've been in the school for a year you're going back to your regular school you're going to totally dominate you're going to be number one you're going to learn so much more it's just going to be awesome so we would need to bring we wouldn't need to bring these young these these children into the school for for the entire time because you know you could go back out of the regular world and overlay what you learned at the academy and you would just dominate I would I would foster that thread through everything so that everything made sense in a big picture and that way when you get granular you're tying it into this overlying theme of civilization and the movement of the way things go through civilization now I'll tell you another piece of this you would learn vocational skills at my school a hundred percent you would learn carpenter you would learn how to do electrical wiring you would learn plumbing you would learn automotive and repair you would learn all those things and guess what are you going to take those courses like I said this this court this school would probably only be a year long that's fine because guess what you know long it takes to learn basic carpenter not real long are you know and I'm sure this would probably I'm sure this would would be implemented in the whole system is how the teachers and instructors are treated for sure you know like because I think that's a lot of the time anyway like one of the many issues you know one that one issues come up in education it's like how are the teachers regarded but you should at least know what the requirements of my job are you shouldn't at least know what the outcomes at a strategic level of my job are right you see what I'm saying there's a difference so you don't have to go in there and be overly humble you don't have to go in there and be overtly blank wide open with what you don't know because again I was cautious to make this note because this doesn't I you should feel comfortable enough saying hey I don't know how to do this or hey can you explain that the way that works to me can you explain what this project you know what this project entails there's nothing wrong with that there's nothing wrong with that And you're like, oh, like, you knew how's joking, but he was like, you know, kind of like, what would you think about that? So, like I said in life, plan, study the route that you're going to go, think about the obstacles, how are you going to avoid them, what do your goals look like, what do your smaller goals look like, along the way, the little reference points. You know, kind of like he's, it's almost like him and Matrix run the same team still, you know, he knows how he would see that, you know, kind of that same thing. but then you know you want to go well when you think about it you're probably wouldn't be that hardcore in fact it'd probably be kind of fun given your approach to you know teaching or in leading and stuff like that because man I remember when I it was like when I first met you I met you and you don't remember when I first met you so that's what happens needs to happen here with the leadership team we've got to find out who's right and people that are right need to convince that people that are wrong now you need to check your ego obviously cross the board every team everybody on the teams got to check the ego because a lot of people will be holding on to their idea because it's their idea and they love their idea because there's egotistical and that's how I would deal with mixed messages coming down the chain of command I'm gonna go ahead and just say it that that could have been one of the best lines I've ever heard if you're right you'll win the argument if you're wrong you'll change your mind that's a good that's a good one you just think that up and I'm not or I'm having some issues and some hesitations on if I'll be good enough have you ever been in a position before were you tried to bite off more than you can chew professionally how do you approach it and is there ever a time where you think it's best to bow out and quit and if so how do you know when that point is so actually most people get hired into leadership positions they haven't been in before the seal teams is all about that you get promoted you do that leadership job and just as you're getting the hang of it you get promoted again so there's nothing abnormal about feeling that you aren't quite ready for a leadership position and the reason that some people fail when they get to these positions that they're not ready for is because they're nervous that they're going to show that and so they try to hide it they're afraid to ask questions they're afraid to say they don't know so they end up looking scared and stupid which equates to looking incompetent yeah you can I don't know if it was a documentary it's something like that word a guy just put chalk that's all it was chalk and there he was like hey look protein powder sell it and either he found there was like there was no regulation saying he couldn't do it technically but I've looked for property and said okay this would probably work so like a like almost like an extension school like in the little so or just have them like where they're like you know welcome come to the gym you know like these They have Arnold because he's like, he's walking around the compound that he's kind of like, you know, and all these guys are like talking tough and stuff. yeah they only have triple air whatever sure they get saved but if they can do them themselves you know so at my school you would learn those vocational skills and then on top of that you'd learn basic survival skills little hunting little fishing little gardening and planting and how to grow things grow food and your basics water fire and shelter you learn those so you'd be able to survive in an environment in any situation obviously with all those survival skills and the vocational skills and even the classroom knowledge skills there would be a a system of team building where you're going to be doing things together as a team not only for your classes but also cleaning the place working together as a team and that's what they do in military boot camps all you do clean but you also part of leadership is confidence and up and down so you gotta have some confidence and you people have to have some confidence in you and if if you don't know anything and you can't figure it out for you can't figure out some portions of that on your own that's not a good sign because I just expect if you're gonna be in charge of me that you couldn't look that up you didn't you didn't review this before you came in here I know you don't know my job So if this guy's near presence can make these other guys follow him like that in these type of situations, like if more people would be like this guy, you know. like I'm really not this good you can be like champion of the world on the inside you're like this just a matter of time before they find me out you know Man, that pretty much every word that's coming from that is like, man, it's reminding me of this where, like, this certain people in a group that can do that, that can go and like, you know, he'll wash your shoes and you don't, you don't automatically have that respect. And in some cases, you'll have less respect if like, sure, like they're kissing your butt and they don't have anything to look up to, you know, or, you know, these these kind of guys or whatever. So that's pace notes and it, and it, it's almost like a rehearsal, you know, it's almost like a rehearsal because you can, you can walk the whole team through and they can get a visualization of what they're going to see and how it's going to look.
