[00:00:00] This is Jockelpont Cas number 325.
[00:00:02] With echo trails and me, Jockel Willing.
[00:00:05] Good evening, echo.
[00:00:06] Good evening.
[00:00:07] And also, joining us again tonight is Jason Gardner.
[00:00:11] Good evening, Jason.
[00:00:12] Good evening.
[00:00:13] Chicago Times Special Camp Robinson, Nebraska May 24th, 1877.
[00:00:26] Your correspondent has obtained some very valuable information in regard to the Custer massacre
[00:00:33] from crazy horse, through horned horse as his spokesman, which is authentic and confirmed
[00:00:41] by other principal chiefs.
[00:00:44] I interviewed the chiefs this afternoon.
[00:00:47] Lieutenant Clark arranging for the meeting in William Hunter acting as interpreter
[00:00:51] a man perfectly reliable and thoroughly converse in the Indian language.
[00:00:58] This is the Indian version and the first published.
[00:01:01] The attack was made on the village by a strong force at 11 o'clock in the morning at the
[00:01:06] upper end of the village.
[00:01:10] This was the force commanded by Major Reno and very shortly afterward the lower end of the
[00:01:16] village was attacked by another strong force that commanded by Custer.
[00:01:21] The village was divided into seven different bands of Indians each commanded by a separate
[00:01:27] chief and extended in nearly a straight line.
[00:01:32] The village consisted of 18 hundred lodges and at least 400 wicky ups, a lodge made of
[00:01:40] small poles and willows for temporary shelter.
[00:01:43] Each of the wicky ups contained four young bucks and the estimate made by crazy horses
[00:01:48] that each lodge had from three to four warriors.
[00:01:54] Estimating at three made a fighting force of seven thousand Indians.
[00:02:00] This is the lowest estimate that can be made for there were a good many Indians without
[00:02:05] shelter hangers on who fought when called upon and the usual number was much above seven
[00:02:12] thousand.
[00:02:14] The attack was a surprise and totally unlipped for when Custer made the charge the women
[00:02:21] proposes children and in fact all that were not fighters made a stampede in an orderly
[00:02:27] direction.
[00:02:29] Custer seemed so numerous about a mistook them for the main body of Indians retreating
[00:02:33] and abandoning their villages and immediately gave pursuit.
[00:02:37] The warriors in the village seeing this divided their forces into two parts.
[00:02:42] One intercepting Custer between their non-combatants and him and the other getting his in his
[00:02:47] rear.
[00:02:49] Outnumbering him as they did they had him at their mercy and the dreadful massacre ensued.
[00:02:58] Horned horse says the smoke and dust were so great that folk could not be distinguished
[00:03:04] from friend.
[00:03:05] The horses were wild with fright and uncontrollable.
[00:03:08] The Indians were knocking each other from their steeds and it is an absolute fact
[00:03:12] that several young bucks in their excitement and fury killed each other, several dead Indians
[00:03:17] being found killed by arrows.
[00:03:20] Horned horse represented this hell of fire and smoke and death by intertwining his fingers
[00:03:26] and saying just like this Indians and white men.
[00:03:33] These chiefs say they suffered a loss of 58 killed and over 60 wounded.
[00:03:38] And their way of expressing it I should judge that about 60% of their wounded died.
[00:03:45] While this butcher he was going on, Reno was fighting in the upper part of the village but
[00:03:50] did not get in so far as to get surrounded and manage to escape.
[00:03:56] They say had he got in his far, he would have suffered the same fate as Custer but he
[00:04:02] retreated to the Bluffs and was held there until Indians fighting Custer.
[00:04:08] Rising over half the village could join the northern portion in besieging him.
[00:04:15] These Indians claim that but for the time the arrival of General Terry they would have
[00:04:21] certainly got Reno.
[00:04:23] They would have surrounded and stormed him out or would have besieged and eventually captured
[00:04:29] him.
[00:04:31] From what I know of crazy horse I should say that he no doubt is capable of conducting a siege.
[00:04:37] In both the Rose Bud fight and the Custer massacre the Indians claim that crazy horse
[00:04:46] rode unarmed in the thickest of the fight invoking the blessing of the great spirit on
[00:04:51] himself that if he was right he might be victorious and if wrong that he might be killed.
[00:05:05] So that right there is an excerpt from a book called I fought with Custer which we covered
[00:05:12] on this podcast podcast number 48.
[00:05:16] You might want to go check that one out and that's from a section that we actually didn't
[00:05:21] cover on the podcast.
[00:05:23] The section of the book that's called They fought against Custer and it's got a bunch
[00:05:27] of firsthand accounts from the Indians that fought against Custer.
[00:05:35] And I didn't cover that section because we had already covered the Native American perspective
[00:05:41] in podcast 45 where we discussed the book called Wooden Leg who was a northern Cheyenne
[00:05:50] Indian who fought against Custer at Little Big Horn.
[00:05:55] And that's a good podcast to listen to.
[00:05:58] I've got quite a few seal friends that that's one of their favorite podcasts.
[00:06:04] But this man that gets mentioned here this warrior he's mentioned in both those books.
[00:06:12] And he's mentioned pretty quickly in both the books but he's someone that is definitely
[00:06:19] worth exploring as a warrior as a man and as a leader and Jason you sent me a great
[00:06:27] book while back called the Journey of Crazy Horse.
[00:06:30] This book is written by a guy named Joseph M. Marshall the third who himself is a member
[00:06:38] of the Lakota tribe.
[00:06:39] He was raised on the Rosebud Indian reservation in South Dakota and he kind of reports
[00:06:49] on or explores his journey of discovering and understanding crazy horse and starts off
[00:06:58] with a certain image of crazy horse and then learns more about him over time.
[00:07:08] Kind of going from a legend held aloft sort of above being human to being a warrior to being
[00:07:16] a leader and then ultimately understanding him as a man.
[00:07:21] And much of what he's you know I always like to do the first person accounting that's
[00:07:25] what I'm always trying to get for the podcast and this much of what Joseph talks about.
[00:07:36] Joseph Marshall talks about is stuff that was passed to him through his elders through
[00:07:41] oral history and that's I think what allows this book to come to life so well so guess
[00:07:49] we dive into the journey of the journey of crazy horse by Joseph M. Marshall the third.
[00:08:00] Where did you find this book originally?
[00:08:01] So I got a buddy that lives in Iowa, Chris Anderson and he sent me this book to read
[00:08:09] it was like how you need to check this out.
[00:08:11] So about two years ago I knocked it out on audible and then as we started to do the you
[00:08:19] know we're doing the battlefield a little big one you know I'm like well I want to understand
[00:08:23] more about the for everything that cost her did wrong there's stuff that's sitting
[00:08:28] born crazy horse we're doing right now I want to try to understand more that so I hit
[00:08:33] this book up and then it made sense for something that we could talk about here especially
[00:08:37] because it's from the Lakota perspective and brought down from their oral history.
[00:08:43] Yeah the we're so the battlefield that you're talking about this is an event that we do
[00:08:48] at echelon front where we go and look at the we go and walk the battlefield and there's
[00:08:52] all these leaders to learn from.
[00:08:54] I mean we do get his bird and this would be the first one that the first series that we're
[00:09:00] going to do up at a little big horn.
[00:09:03] So going out there understanding the personalities of these individuals gives you so much
[00:09:08] more depth into understanding their leadership decisions and the decisions that they made
[00:09:13] you can start to identify how their personalities impacted their decisions and then you
[00:09:20] can look at yourself and say what part of my personality is impacting my decision and we
[00:09:26] I haven't been to live you've been a little big horn yet yeah I have same kind of spiritual
[00:09:33] impact as get his bird yes and it's incredible because you you can sit you can sit in the
[00:09:39] gully where Reno had hit they well they came across a came across river and attacked the south
[00:09:45] end of the camp because initially they could only see a portion of it and thought it was
[00:09:48] much smaller and then they'd the morons didn't listen to their crow scouts who said whoa that's
[00:09:54] a much bigger in cabin than you think it is and you you can see all these spots and and it's
[00:10:01] just it's it's it's it's it's it's really humbling to be able to see it and talk about it
[00:10:06] and discuss what's going on and and feel the energy it was there yeah I'm looking forward to
[00:10:12] what when we doing that August it's August yeah all right so let's get into this book
[00:10:18] here we go crazy horses been my hero since I was a boy he was arguably the best known
[00:10:24] Lakota leader in the latter half of the 19th century a turbulent time on the northern plains
[00:10:30] at first I knew crazy horse only as a fighting man the warrior
[00:10:34] I didn't know or care what he felt what he thought I cared only that he was a Lakota
[00:10:40] and that he was brave and performed deeds that fired my imagination
[00:10:45] but it's time went on there were more stories I now know crazy horse as a man
[00:10:51] first and a legend second a very distant second in fact he is much like my father and my uncles
[00:10:58] and my all my grandfather's he walks straight he's polite and he speaks softly
[00:11:06] but there's also an aura of mystery about him as though sometimes I am seeing him in a
[00:11:12] mist that blends legend and reality it's that aura that seems to appeal to most people
[00:11:18] and I'm convinced that many want to connect with the mystery more than they want to identify
[00:11:23] with the man I can remember consciously hearing his name for the first time the summer I was six
[00:11:29] years old my grandfather Albert and a man I knew as grandpa Isaac and I had just crossed the
[00:11:36] little white river and stopped arrest as they both fashion their role your own cigarettes one of
[00:11:42] them compared the slow the slow moving little white to the greasy grass river I learned later
[00:11:50] that the greasy grass was in south central Montana and was also known as a little big horn
[00:11:57] in the shade of a thick grove of sand bar willow the two old men spoke about a battle
[00:12:03] and names that I had never heard before or at least that I couldn't remember hearing before
[00:12:09] rolled off their tongues that day along the river one name was repeated more often than the
[00:12:16] others in the story of that battle the name his crazy horse he was a leader of fighting men
[00:12:24] and his mere appearance on the battlefield was apparently enough to inspire others to fight
[00:12:30] crazy horse had led a charge of warriors against the soldiers in the second engagement of that
[00:12:34] battle a leader commented on that particular action when recounting the battle years later by saying
[00:12:40] I have never seen anything so brave by the age of six I'd already listened to many stories from
[00:12:47] these two grandfather's I was well aware that being a fighting man was one way of being a man
[00:12:53] in the Lakota ways of old I knew that men were often injured or wounded in battle and sometimes
[00:12:58] killed and I knew that in a battle a man could prove himself for one man to obviously evoke
[00:13:06] such reverence and respect from two grandfather's who told the story of 1876 greasy grass fight
[00:13:12] the battle of little big horn was of some consequence in my six year old world I could think of only
[00:13:20] two or three other old men in the same category as these two grandfather's so when they respected
[00:13:26] someone it was no small thing that day by the little white river crazy horse became a part of my life
[00:13:42] we were having this conversation I think yesterday this idea and I think I had brought it up
[00:13:50] on some other podcast but the idea that this if you're going to go out and fight
[00:13:58] is that programmed into us is that just what we're raised with that we think hey going out and fighting
[00:14:05] and being heroic being a warrior is a cool thing is a good thing or is there some sort of
[00:14:11] genetic component to it because as a human being in a group of other human beings that are trying to
[00:14:19] survive 10,000 years ago and we're part of a gang we're part of a tribe and if Jason is the kind
[00:14:27] of guy that goes out and kills a buffalo or defends our tribe then you help us all survive and so
[00:14:36] we're naturally we naturally intuitively instinctively elevate the people that are ready to fight
[00:14:42] and we can't even control it I don't know what do you think yeah it's it's interesting because
[00:14:51] the good hunters also translate to their good warriors right but then in their society in
[00:14:56] the Lakota Society the medicine men were also revered as well so I guess people were elevated
[00:15:05] based on whatever they brought to the community with large and then oftentimes with either the
[00:15:11] medicine men or the warriors eventually you age out of it and then they're looking at you for
[00:15:18] for your wisdom you know like Chamberlain that guy comes over from like the intellectual
[00:15:28] side of the house because he's a college professor when he joins the army so it's kind of like
[00:15:32] he wasn't really that that's what makes him so interesting and so cool is he's like good at everything
[00:15:37] every side of the Rubik's Cube you examine with that guy he's square the solid colors yeah
[00:15:43] the thing is though you have all these different societies around the world that are some of them are totally
[00:15:49] disconnected from other societies and there's like always a warrior tradition yes it leads me to believe that
[00:15:56] at least at some level human beings look at the person that's ready to stand up and fight and defend
[00:16:04] and they have an instinctual inherent elevation elevated attitude towards that person here this
[00:16:13] guy is six years old you know I'm thinking and he's hearing these stories and thinks it's cool
[00:16:18] in the parlance of our time right like hey that's wow this sounds cool what was I doing when I was
[00:16:24] eight years old watching apocalypse now thinking that's cool that guy he special forces he's going on
[00:16:34] this mission up the river that's cool I don't know I mean my dad wasn't in the military there was
[00:16:43] no my grandfather was but he wasn't super influential in my life and all of the sudden as just instinct
[00:16:51] that looks cool it yeah because it doesn't appear to be generation leaving in this case crazy
[00:16:58] horses dad is a matter of fact he's not a fighter yeah um and so you know you look at how we
[00:17:07] revere sports figures and in a lot of ways their warriors you choose a sporting team and they're
[00:17:14] the ones that are going out and doing battle with other sporting teams or rooting for them and
[00:17:17] they're who are putting up on a pedestal for the most spot it it's not that different than
[00:17:26] then combat which who's going on it's an interesting thing to discuss feels like there's an
[00:17:32] element of risk there too like so skill and then risk and sacrifice that for everybody sacrifice for
[00:17:38] everybody else and they're they're lies in why we hold up like that courage as being a value that we
[00:17:47] or something that we value right is courage yeah like if you if you're a little
[00:17:53] say like I'm a six year old or whatever and you think of some guy who goes out and kills a buffalo
[00:17:58] and then brings it back or whatever you think man if I want to try to kill a buffalo and
[00:18:03] things in a kill me you know so he's like good at what he does he's risk dying and then when he
[00:18:08] brings it back it's for all of us he's like hero you know right so kind of it's I mean that's obviously
[00:18:13] like a metaphor or the the sporting teams and stuff that's a metaphor yeah that's a big
[00:18:17] but of the same thing though yeah exactly but I and I think this is so obvious what we're saying
[00:18:23] I ask my actual question is is it instinctual is it like part of our nature
[00:18:33] that we can you know it may or may not get you know expanded upon as we grow up in some people
[00:18:39] you know being a warrior stupid why would you go and sacrifice yourself for other people like
[00:18:44] that's unattitude so you can overcome this instinct but it is kind of crazy to think hey this is
[00:18:52] the way many different societies from all different background all kind of elevate this warrior
[00:18:59] is it an in isn't a natural animal instinct to think this person's going to protect the tribe
[00:19:06] this person's going to help the tribe this person's going to feed the tribe this person's possibly
[00:19:09] going to sacrifice for themselves for the tribe and that's a positive thing we're going to
[00:19:13] elevate them because they're putting the tribe before themselves they're putting themselves at
[00:19:18] risk in order to save the tribe and that's why it's very likely instinctual and
[00:19:26] I don't I don't I don't I think that's no matter where you look if you examine closely
[00:19:31] that's still revered today this individual human overcame the the instinct of self preservation
[00:19:41] to look out for me and look out for my family we're going to elevate that individual
[00:19:48] all right going back to the book here every Lakota baby was born with thick shiny black hair
[00:19:54] that stayed black for most of adulthood but the hair of the son of crazy horse seemed to grow
[00:19:59] lighter even as he lost his baby fat which happened to him quicker than the most children
[00:20:04] to his mother and the other women in his life it was an endearing characteristic
[00:20:09] although they worried that it would prove to be troublesome for him later in life
[00:20:13] outside the reach of sharp ears he was referred to as the light-haired one
[00:20:20] to his face he was simply called Gigi or light hair so he's got a distinctive characteristic
[00:20:29] out of the gate which is also kind of interesting you know you got a my name is Joko which is
[00:20:37] a weird name and I've had that it's a nickname but it's been my nickname since I was born
[00:20:40] which meant when I met someone when I was five years old and seven years old and four years old
[00:20:47] and ten years old they would say what's your name and I had to say this weird name you know my
[00:20:54] name is Joko but that's I didn't really know that that was just a nickname it's all as a
[00:20:59] older so you kind of have to contend with this right it's kind of like oh you got to contend with this
[00:21:05] what happened in weird name you haven't weird name yes I know that did you know that yes
[00:21:08] there I did did you did you you feel that a little bit like when you were six years old yes
[00:21:15] you did now Jason was as hey I'm Jason good you have to spell it you know the mispronounce
[00:21:20] you're just good to go no so I think these kind of distinctive characteristic can sometimes help
[00:21:28] they can also sometimes I think hurt kids when you're young you got some weird like sometimes
[00:21:34] have to kids grow really tall quickly yeah and they don't they don't like it you know they feel like
[00:21:39] awkward or people are looking at them or when you get glasses right that's another thing maybe
[00:21:44] it's not that big of a deal when I was a kid like when someone had glasses they had to contend with
[00:21:48] that yeah to deal with it but they're tempering them it's making I mean that's the metaphor he uses
[00:21:53] in here that it the teasing temper's crazy horse to make him hard and it's a boy named Sue yes
[00:22:00] that's exactly what I was thinking about and his metaphor is like hanging the staff and the T.P. for
[00:22:04] five years to slowly temper it and make it harder and then you're going to carve that ass dive into a bow
[00:22:13] we were talking about buds earlier and amazed that they're still a huge attrition rate
[00:22:19] and our thoughts are it it's because a lot of the some of the folks that are there and are such
[00:22:23] good athletes that never failed anything whereas opposed when I got there and and I'd already
[00:22:30] failed it a bunch of stuff and I was used to getting beat up at getting knockdown and it's like
[00:22:35] I'm just gonna dust myself up and get moving again yeah you and I were saying that when they
[00:22:40] when the instructors looked at us and said you suck we were like yeah I know obviously
[00:22:45] but if you're like the star athlete and you get told you suck and you and then you lose the race
[00:22:52] because by the way because you're so athletic they make you do a bunch of jump squats before you do
[00:22:57] the sprint race and then you lose and then they call you loser and it's never happened before and
[00:23:02] all of a sudden you're like I this isn't for me I can't win in this arena or I'm not good enough
[00:23:08] and meanwhile you got Joe slightly below average athlete which is me just like well I'll keep going
[00:23:15] I suck yeah I know but I'm gonna keep going I'm used to this yeah yeah
[00:23:18] uh the other thing and he mentions in the book I'm not gonna highlight it but they called him
[00:23:25] the women decided to call him light hair to just get it over with it was like hey you know oh
[00:23:31] you got you look a little bit funky cool we're just gonna we're just gonna break make it
[00:23:35] where's gonna call you that just get it out in the open get the elephant yeah in the room out
[00:23:41] why not yeah isn't that what all the psychology does it's like oh you're afraid of elevator so
[00:23:44] let's make you look at a bunch of pictures elevators and eventually maybe you get in one
[00:23:48] and then late you just do graduated exposure and that's what they did here
[00:23:53] the students to work yeah it's okay to be offended everybody thank you harder
[00:24:01] there came a day when someone handed light hair a bow and a quiver of arrows to suited to his
[00:24:06] size and strength it was the first tangible sign of life that lay ahead and his mother smiled
[00:24:10] because she was proud or son would fall the path of a hunter and warrior hey the caveat obviously
[00:24:16] not reading the whole book it's an awesome book if you if it sounds a little stilted when I'm reading
[00:24:20] it like wait what's going on it's cuz I'm not reading the whole book get it and the audio book
[00:24:26] you mentioned I think the audio book is read by the author so that makes it good too change came
[00:24:32] into light hair's life and this is fast forward change came into light hair's life and yet another
[00:24:37] way she who gave him life lost her own in the perception of the child at the time the perception
[00:24:45] perception of time for a child can be often be irrelevant especially in a culture that was not
[00:24:50] given to measuring it he was too young to understand that death is a part of life later he would
[00:24:55] realize his mother's time on earth had been much too short so his mother dies when he's young
[00:25:02] fast forward a little bit more seasons turned and I just just FYI you know be in a guy that's
[00:25:11] in the language and stuff there's a whole section that this thing starts off talking about the
[00:25:16] the language the Lakota language really cool the read I'm not gonna read it for two reasons
[00:25:21] the primary reason being just me sitting here trying to pronounce these words would be a disaster
[00:25:26] uh but they add a lot to the story when you read the story so another reason to get the book
[00:25:34] one day light hair and his sister were given new mothers they were sisters quiet and polite as they
[00:25:41] walked into the circle of their new life as the wives of crazy horse so the crazy horse that we're
[00:25:46] talking about in this particular moment is the dad the dad that you mentioned Jason is a medicine man
[00:25:52] so the dad is named crazy horse at this time and that's where they're talking about when they
[00:25:55] refer to crazy horse not light hair the son who is the crazy horse that we all know about and their
[00:26:02] mothers and daughters of his own son um going forward a little bit more the boy didn't completely
[00:26:09] understand all about his father but he did know that crazy horse didn't hunt like the other man
[00:26:14] or go to war a father who is a medicine man and didn't do the things men did cause the boy to feel
[00:26:21] all the more different he wondered most of all why he looked different than the other boys so that's
[00:26:28] another thing in his childhood everyone's talking about my dad's in the deems or my dad's going
[00:26:34] to war and he's like well my dad's gonna go uh you know move smoke around and stuff so he feels awkward
[00:26:40] about that hunting was the Lakota lifeblood like the wolf fox eagle mountain lion and hawk
[00:26:48] the Lakota were hunters at age seven light hair realized more and more that hunting was the way to
[00:26:53] have fresh meat and deer and elk hides for clothing and buffalo hide for lodge coverings he also
[00:26:59] sense that he would be part of the process somehow like all boys light hair was becoming skilled
[00:27:04] with his bow he had progressed to a stout a stout her bow stronger than the first he was given
[00:27:10] one made in proportion to his size and strength his favorite game had changed as well shooting arrows
[00:27:16] through a rolling willow hoop had become too easy in boring so his uncle little hawk and a few
[00:27:23] other men introduced him to a new game shooting at grasshoppers the rules were simple walk along the
[00:27:31] prairie with an arrow on the bow string and shoot it a grasshopper when it flew rolling hope a rolling
[00:27:36] hoop was a much easier target a grasshopper was about the size of his little finger in flew
[00:27:41] erratically and fast the men would suppress smiles when it first the boy was able to get off a shot
[00:27:48] before he could pull back the string the insect was back in the grass but as he learned to hold
[00:27:53] his bow ready he could send an arrow in the general direction of the flitting grasshopper shooting
[00:27:59] a grasshoppers was not boring it was he learned of very humbling experience as the summer war on
[00:28:05] his reaction became faster and more and more his arrows only narrowly missed grasshoppers and old
[00:28:11] man told him have much to teach awesome just awesome stuff you're going out to see
[00:28:20] Dudley aren't you and you're just thinking that I wonder if you're going to start
[00:28:25] that walking around zapping grasshopper yeah you're going to get dialed in um freaking awesome what a
[00:28:36] what a way to grow up and what a way to get good you're just that's what you do that's what you do
[00:28:47] fast forward a little bit important character comes into play as the days passed he unknowingly
[00:28:51] attracted the interest of a and curiosity of a man called high backbone the mini conjue with a
[00:28:57] ogala wife a gala wife and he liked what he saw in the shy light hair and I might I don't think
[00:29:05] I'd mention that yet so Marshall mentioned it that crazy horse is quiet and he doesn't talk a lot
[00:29:13] but they they do give some examples in the book of when he's a kid they're playing games and he's not saying
[00:29:18] anything you know he just he's a quiet he's a quiet the term he used here shy perhaps it was the
[00:29:24] boys quiet determination or is innate humility high backbone himself was a quiet man not given
[00:29:31] to pursuing the path of glory but he was deeply committed to achieving the status of wika the complete man
[00:29:39] the complete man embodied the best qualities of the hunter and the fighting man
[00:29:44] though all men necessarily filled the roles of both provider and protector the hunter warrior
[00:29:52] not everyone could achieve the highest ideals for both calling high backbone was one of the few
[00:29:59] high backbone was a leader of fighting men muscular and broad shoulder exuding the confidence of a man
[00:30:06] who not only had physical strength but also a lifetime of experience and accomplishment so this guy
[00:30:16] high backbone kind of becomes a mentor to to light hair and this idea this idea of being good
[00:30:26] and multiple phases you know it's what who you say about the ruby cube chamberland chamberland yeah
[00:30:32] because it's like you know yeah he's good on every side that you examine yeah and that's that's
[00:30:37] what high backbone has that same quality they lay out these these virtues of the wika which I
[00:30:43] thought was was really interesting on go and it's it's in the forward but it says the the virtues
[00:30:50] are generosity courage fortitude and wisdom those and the very first thing they're saying for a
[00:30:57] warrior in a man is is generosity which is pretty cool courage and fortitude and wisdom yeah
[00:31:10] fast forward a little bit like most Lakota boys approaching the age of 12 light hair was a
[00:31:16] proficient hunter like all hunters light hair learned to sit motionless and the drift would
[00:31:20] blind along a creek for the better part of an afternoon waiting for a white tail to move within
[00:31:24] effective killing range of his bow which is as far as he could throw a stone with all his might
[00:31:30] it's pretty cool that's a pretty good uh i'm thinking he's probably able to go
[00:31:40] 60 yards what's your estimation oh no he's 12 years old he's 12 years old he's
[00:31:46] don't rock what do you think he could throw rock I think he's probably at 15 or 20 yards really
[00:31:52] yeah echo Charles assessment 35 40 though because think about it what's his draw what's his
[00:31:59] draw on his strength yeah 12 it's it's probably not that hard pretty small yeah that's a good point
[00:32:06] but dude we're talking about a kid that's just walking around freaking shooting grass
[00:32:09] animals all day long so well and if you heard about like the the the the old British long bow
[00:32:18] archers that had like a draw weight of 120 pounds or something and they weren't compound bows
[00:32:23] they were just drawing back that much weight yeah so the Mongols had 80 pound bows that's insane that's
[00:32:31] insane yeah um we interesting to hear what they're they're what they've someone on the other put in the
[00:32:38] column yeah someone will tell us some will tell us what the what that range was so he's hunting um
[00:32:49] here's another he's got another friend another friend named lone bear fast forward a little bit
[00:32:55] lone bear and light hair road straight to a slight rise north of the fort and this is so now there's
[00:33:00] they're they're doing exploring kind of like kid stuff and they go to look at fort lairamy
[00:33:07] warned by crazy horse that's the dad and high back bone not to go nearer but it was a good enough
[00:33:15] vantage point to see buildings in this rounding area a wide trail led to the fort from the southeast
[00:33:20] and a way to the west on the other side of the main area of activity which was among the light
[00:33:26] colored buildings and along the trail what were what they could only assumed to be abandoned wagons
[00:33:35] they resembled skeletons most of them stripped down of the frames whites were everywhere
[00:33:39] along with their horses mules oxen and cattle the occasional barking of dogs reached the boys ears
[00:33:46] south of the buildings they could see the tops of several Lakota lodges a few Lakota stayed near
[00:33:51] the fort from the days before the soldiers had taken over in the days when it was only a trade
[00:33:56] trading town now the rumors were the soldiers had come to protect the travelers along the shell river
[00:34:04] trail and again there's he gives a lot of good detail about all the way this settlement is happening
[00:34:13] the whites are coming how they're doing it what it looks like to to the Indians
[00:34:22] yeah and I'm trying to give enough that you can understand the story
[00:34:26] there's a real bad smallpox outbreak prior to this happening a lot of them are just like
[00:34:31] just I'm staying away from my people period yeah it's a white-out entire groups of people yeah
[00:34:39] yeah they're scared of that they don't want any of that the Lakota called the council at horse
[00:34:46] creek the white piece talkers called it the fort Laramie treaty council of 1851 the whites
[00:34:55] wanted three things first they wanted no more fighting among the people gathered the black
[00:35:00] fleet the black feet and the crow were called upon to live in peace with the Lakota and the
[00:35:06] Lakota were in turn to live in peace with the snakes and so on tell the wind to stop blowing
[00:35:12] some reacted or the rivers to stop flowing second the whites seem to want to say where the
[00:35:19] land ended and where it began by drawing a picture on a parched hide beyond a certain line was
[00:35:25] Crowland and behind it was black feet but who could find that line on the earth someone wondered
[00:35:34] third the travelers on the shell river trail must not be molested they said for they were
[00:35:40] traveling under the protection of the great father who lived in some city far to the east of the
[00:35:45] grandfather river the great father would know if his people on the trail were harmed
[00:35:50] the trail must be holy in some fashion suggested an old Lakota man Riley
[00:35:57] thereafter the shell river trail became known as the holy road for green to these three things
[00:36:04] the peacetalker said the great father was empowering them to pay a new eddies that amounted to many
[00:36:12] thousands of their money in dollars the newbies would be in the form of food beef cattle flower
[00:36:18] and beans for starters and various other goods such as plows hose and other farm implements
[00:36:26] there were many raised eyebrows and helpless shrugs at the listening of listing of other goods
[00:36:30] but in the end they were accepted very very strange you know like it's just a complete
[00:36:43] it's a culture just totally separate even as you're hearing this deal you're thinking
[00:36:53] like you're going to say this land is my that's like if you came into me right now and said hey
[00:36:56] a jockel give you money for your for the air i'd say uh you want to give me money for air cool
[00:37:02] okay you give me money i then also you had some contraption that like sucked the air oh yeah exactly
[00:37:08] I was trying to wrap my head around this whole thing and you're that's exactly what's what's
[00:37:12] what's going on and it's it's clear that like the whites there they they they obviously weren't
[00:37:21] organized and sound kind screwed up too because they had their stuff they were trying to muddle
[00:37:25] their way whole things through this this whole mass on like hey we've got a newbies coming and
[00:37:30] then they don't show up and they're like uh what's uh the annuity's too is a real good you can see
[00:37:38] we're gonna see it throughout this story just the way that we as people if you become
[00:37:47] reliant on someone else if you're given stuff you become reliant and you forget how to do things for
[00:37:52] yourself you know i don't know if the grand plan of the whites was to get them hooked on these
[00:38:01] annuities and then we can just kind of take advantage of i don't know if that was their grand plan
[00:38:05] but that's what happens it definitely like it part part of a three-prong strategy one
[00:38:12] the annuities which i bet you they were just doing to kind of like calm things down but then it
[00:38:17] wound up being like what actually screwed everybody over and it's so reliveent to today
[00:38:24] right because these annuities are like the algorithms on social media or they're like fast food
[00:38:31] or all kinds of other real easy stuff that's like oh cool i'll just swing through McDonald's
[00:38:38] because i'm kind of hungry in not order something healthy off their menu and then
[00:38:46] then you messed up yeah i mean anytime this is you know if from a greater perspective
[00:38:51] communism right hey look i'm gonna pay you regardless if you do your job well or not
[00:38:57] well okay cool i'm not gonna do my job well and you're gonna pay me right that's
[00:39:01] great it happens with you know certain positions certain government positions like oh
[00:39:06] you're gonna get that you're gonna get that paycheck regardless if you're at the DMV no offense
[00:39:11] DMV but if you work at the DMV it doesn't matter if you process
[00:39:17] four license applications today or 29 what's your motivation to produce any more stuff if it's
[00:39:25] all gonna get taken from you and redistributed then you're just gonna do the minimum
[00:39:29] and i think that's what one of the reasons why colonialism is kind of falling on its
[00:39:34] face and all it is it's very disturbing so fast forward a little bit each summer's lines and
[00:39:43] lines of wagons were not the same as those that had come the summer before they carried a different
[00:39:47] group of whites who had never seen a Lakota or a Kaewa or a blue cow cloud but who had been filled
[00:39:53] with stories about the dangers from the brown skin mirotters so wide eyed and fearful of
[00:40:00] were the whites who arrived at the fort not comforted by the sites of scowling Lakota men
[00:40:08] but the Lakota were likewise troubled at the sight of so many white men some of the old ones
[00:40:13] would shake their gray heads and speak a warning in any land among any kind of people three human
[00:40:20] weaknesses are at the root of trouble fear anger and arrogance right i'll relevant is that to us today
[00:40:32] yep fear anger and arrogance those weaknesses were about to be mixed
[00:40:39] yeah fear anger and arrogance by the way root cause those obviously arrogance is ego but anger often
[00:40:52] also ego and a lot of these circumstances are very egotistical in this book that the anger is triggered
[00:41:01] from ego yeah and the hatred which i think kakana is a little bit different but you can attach it
[00:41:07] to anger and usually it's rooted in some kind of fear no life has a way of creating strange
[00:41:18] circumstances that often lead to a bad end or an unexpected turn when i read that i was like damn it
[00:41:30] you know because you don't want to admit that don't want to admit it you don't want to say you know
[00:41:38] what let's sometimes things happen that result to a bad end it's such a sad thing to think about
[00:41:47] but it's the freaking reality of life so he goes on to this section here
[00:41:56] that speaking of anger and fear and arrogance there's a there's a cow that wanders into this
[00:42:06] camp and it says it was into conquering bears camp that an old foot sore cow wandered on especially
[00:42:12] hot afternoon the Lakota didn't own any cattle of course so it was correctly assumed that she had
[00:42:18] been lost or abandoned by some white man trying to escape the barking dogs she was running between
[00:42:23] lodges knocking over meat racks after the loft or stop someone realized that although old and thin
[00:42:29] she was fresh meat so they you know they kill a cow word of the predicament spread quickly
[00:42:43] through the camps because now someone's mad i think believe it was a Mormon they call it they keep
[00:42:49] calling the Mormon man a Mormon man wanted the cow he's complaining the soldiers that is cow had
[00:42:56] been stolen so word of the predicament quickly spread through the camps the next afternoon the soldiers
[00:43:05] started from the fort in two wagons and with two wagon guns but the man leading them was not
[00:43:11] flemming this is one of the soldiers that they had worked with or knew it was one called
[00:43:16] gratin a new officer lately come from the east with him was a man married to a Lakota woman
[00:43:24] a speaks white brought along to translate gratin it was later learned had been loud about his
[00:43:31] disdain for the Lakota so you got now an arrogant guy that's also afraid and when the soldiers
[00:43:40] reached his camp conquering bear left his lodged to meet them even as they jumped from the wagons
[00:43:44] and formed two lines facing the camp the old man was still trying to stop the trouble but his
[00:43:49] efforts were ignored meanwhile the speaks white road up and down the line of soldiers shouting
[00:43:54] threats in Lakota south of the camp hidden in low shrubbery light hair and lone bear so you got
[00:44:02] young crazy horse and his little buddy watched the old man and strained to hear him but couldn't
[00:44:08] gratin stepped down from his horse and helped load one of the wagon guns aimed into the camp
[00:44:15] the officer shouted the wagon gun blasted and all movement seemed to come to a stop but for a heartbeat
[00:44:23] the tops of a lodged lodges poles splintered into many pieces then the soldiers aimed their
[00:44:29] rifles and fired before the echo from the wagon gun had faded a astonished and unable to immediately
[00:44:36] perceive the reality unfolding before their eyes the two boys watched conquering bear fall back
[00:44:42] struck in the chest and stomach the second wagon gun boomed and then the Lakota men reacted
[00:44:49] before the soldiers could reload their rifles to fire again a few Lakota guns boomed arrows flew
[00:44:54] and then angry men ran toward the scattering soldiers gratin was one of the first to fall
[00:45:00] so like that's how things kind of start to go bad in the world it's like a little
[00:45:09] misunderstanding then you have that anger that fear that arrogance and initially they tried
[00:45:16] at some point prior to this whole thing break and I'm like hey we're going to give you
[00:45:20] sorry about the cow we're going to give you a couple of good horses way better than a cow
[00:45:25] and our estimation in in trade for that and they're like oh no no that's not going to work
[00:45:35] show up and start shooting which obviously does not work nothing work out well for
[00:45:40] grab doesn't work out well for grab does it work out well for anybody no
[00:45:48] there's a there's certain sections in this book
[00:45:50] so there's books there's part of the book he's telling the story of crazy horse and
[00:45:56] he's got sections marshals got sections and here called called reflections and he's got
[00:46:02] this one section where he kind of gives his perspective on what he on on the events that he's
[00:46:11] kind of written about he says and I'm not going to read the whole thing there's a whole bunch of
[00:46:16] incredible points that he may express he says crazy horse came into the world at least for
[00:46:20] generations ahead of mine he was born in the early 1840s perhaps as late as 1845 I was born in
[00:46:25] 1945 as Lakota males he and I have much in common enough Lakota culture has survived through
[00:46:31] changes during those four generations fortunately to allow my generation to identify strongly
[00:46:37] with his so he has like things in common he says this by the time light hair was 10 or 11
[00:46:44] euro americans were a consistent presence and an increasing annoyance the Oregon trailer
[00:46:50] had been caught across the southern part of the territory beginning the late 1840s it became a steady
[00:46:56] stream of white emigrants moving east to west from late spring to mid summer tens of thousands of
[00:47:02] people thousands of oxen mules and horses and hundreds of wagons passed through every summer for 20
[00:47:07] years those people carried with them many things new to Lakota some beneficial such as
[00:47:14] iron knives and cooking pots and some destructive such as liquor and disease most of all they brought change
[00:47:26] my grandparents and their generation were not too different from light hairs parents and
[00:47:30] grandparents the elderly the Kota of the 1850s in the face of the white incursion and changes brought
[00:47:36] to them were telling stories and reminding their children and grandchildren to remember the
[00:47:41] trailers they had walked hand crafting a bow out of ash is almost a lost art for the Lakota
[00:47:51] my grandfather taught me because his father white tail feather and second father which is a step
[00:47:57] father Henry two hawk taught him to make bows and arrows they learned it from their fathers and
[00:48:03] grandfather's and the methods and process are the same as those that were taught to light hair
[00:48:08] exactly the same each time i've had the opportunity to make a bow a thought invariably passes through
[00:48:15] my mind this is the way it has been done for hundreds of generations i make my bows the same way
[00:48:23] crazy horse did that is only one of the many connections i have with him as Lakota boys
[00:48:31] there's a great discussion somewhere in this book where they're talking about the elders and they're
[00:48:35] talking specifically about change they're like hey we used to use lances to hunt the buffalo
[00:48:44] before we came up with bows and arrows and we transitioned over that so we've got to be ready
[00:48:49] to change as things as things come along and they give that historical example and that's a
[00:48:55] struggle isn't it when when we think of valued traditions that we have in our culture
[00:48:59] like what what do we strive to hold on to and and what do we let go of as we grow yeah and there's
[00:49:05] i i don't remember if i'm going to cover this or not but i'll bring it up right now one of those
[00:49:10] same just types of discussions they're talking about there's a time when it's time to get on the new horse
[00:49:16] and like the old horse isn't working anymore you gotta get on a new horse and and that's a
[00:49:21] good expression to keep in your mind because you're riding that horse and it's starting to fade or
[00:49:25] it's not able to do it's job anymore yet got again on a new horse even though you're comfortable
[00:49:30] with your old horse even though you that old horse's been good to you it's not going to work out anymore
[00:49:35] you've got to be ready to transition to the new horse getting now back into the the story
[00:49:46] out of the reflections and back into the story light hair had been in the camp but a few days
[00:49:50] when a rating party prepared to go against the pony and omaha who had become too daring of late
[00:49:57] coming north well past the running water he accepted the invitation to go along the raiders in the
[00:50:04] eat the raiders went east toward the loop river an area of rolling hills and tall grass and many
[00:50:10] deer there they separated into two groups one turned south to probe into pony country and the other
[00:50:16] with spotted tail and iron shell leading had spotted an omaha camp in the breaks of the east in
[00:50:22] the breaks east of the loop a small number of the group crept close to the camp while the rest
[00:50:28] hidden weighted light hair was won staying close to his uncle they crawled in among the horse
[00:50:34] heard and slowly cut the hobbles from the horses legs and chased them out of the camp
[00:50:39] though the omaha didn't immediately respond a large contingent soon started out to recover
[00:50:46] their horses spotted tails group waited a little longer than attacked the camp the few omaha
[00:50:52] men left in camp fought hard but so did the Lakota spotted tail charged several times on horse
[00:50:58] back alone and light hair claimed his first victory as a fighting man and omaha tried to attack
[00:51:04] through some tall grass but light hair stopped him with a well placed arrow the confusion and chaos
[00:51:11] delayed his reaction what he had just done though he was vaguely aware of the man's death throws
[00:51:17] seized by a sudden bravado he crawled through the grass to take the scalp of his first kill
[00:51:25] a wave of sickness swept through him the dead omaha was a young woman
[00:51:31] he turned away the fighting was over the raided been successful though the omaha had recovered
[00:51:38] some of their horses spotted tails daring and courage was the talk around the fire light hair
[00:51:44] sat quietly wrestling with the reality of taking a human life like all newcomers to it he had
[00:51:52] learned something about the unfettered violence of combat ordinary perception did not exist
[00:51:58] and senses became confused the omaha who attacked him seemed to move so swiftly two swiftly
[00:52:05] for a developer at reaction on the other hand when he had let go of her head because he didn't
[00:52:11] want her scalp everything around him seemed to move very very slowly her hair was soft thick and very
[00:52:19] long light hair said nothing although he knew the overall outcome of the raided been good
[00:52:26] they had no they had new horses and no one had been hurt but the face of the dead girl stayed in his mind
[00:52:32] it's a humbling experience for him and he they go into it and we'll get to some of these parts
[00:52:44] but you know when they get done with a battle they go back and kind of tell stories and that's the
[00:52:49] norm and he's already a quiet kid and this just solidifies the fact that he's not going to talk
[00:52:58] about what he's doing a man from the fort came looking for iron shell with a message from the
[00:53:08] French trader burdo the long knives and it's a the long knives what they call the the soldiers because
[00:53:14] they have long swords they call long knives they call the soldiers long knives the long knives had
[00:53:21] received word that the great father which is basically when they say that they're talking about
[00:53:26] the president or at least some form of the supreme government of America the great father was
[00:53:33] very angry over the killing of gratin and his soldiers more soldiers were being sent and their purpose
[00:53:38] was to punish those who had done the killing it was an ominous message but not won totally unexpected
[00:53:45] had the great father been told that the soldier gratin had to open fire first had the great father
[00:53:51] been told that more than adequate payment had been offered several times for the worst the worthless
[00:53:56] cow of the Mormon white man why should the great father care about such facts someone asked that
[00:54:03] was the problem everyone agreed the whites had one truth and the Lakota another
[00:54:09] yeah having talking about that quite a bit especially on the academy
[00:54:21] I haven't used those terms you know I have one truth and you have another but I was say
[00:54:25] I have one perspective and you have another perspective and if you think that your perspective
[00:54:32] is the right one you're you're not correct I mean it's literally not if you can't say that
[00:54:38] you can't look at something you can't look at a situation you can't look at a plan you can't look at an
[00:54:42] idea you can't look at a scenario and say oh I see everything and I understand it
[00:54:50] the the old saying there's two sides to every story actually there's 48 sides to a story
[00:54:54] yeah right there's all these different sides and when these things break down
[00:55:01] it's because you're not listening to other sides of the story it's not you you're believing your own
[00:55:06] story your own side of the story and you can't let that happen and you have to you have to put
[00:55:11] into your calculus that other people see things differently if you don't put out in your calculus
[00:55:15] you're not going to get the right answer so many of these wars so many wars are just
[00:55:27] misunderstanding start with just a straight-up misunderstanding or a little incident that could be
[00:55:32] de-escalated it just turns into the freaking disaster summer past light hair Guitoller his voice
[00:55:41] deepened and he walked with a sure step when there was dancing he stayed in the shadow satisfied only to watch
[00:55:52] light hair fast forward a little light light hair remounted and put his horse into a gallop
[00:55:57] from another and higher vantage point he could see that smoke was rising from the encampments so
[00:56:01] he's out on like a little personal patrol of his own which is he that's another thing I haven't
[00:56:06] done a good job indicating he likes to be by himself so he goes out and hunts by himself he goes
[00:56:12] out in the woods and just sets by himself he likes he's kind of a loner so he's out on one of
[00:56:18] these sort of solo operations and he says from another and higher vantage point he could see that
[00:56:25] smoke was rising from the encampment a few hurs horses were scattered about watching to the north but
[00:56:32] there was nothing else no children playing no dogs running about leaving his horse hobbled he ran
[00:56:39] toward the camp light was fading a dog bark tentatively and a stench hung in the air among the
[00:56:46] smoking lodges and collapse poles were objects scattered over the ground whatever had happened was over
[00:56:54] and eerie silence hung over the camp nothing was moving the horses he had spotted earlier had
[00:57:00] not moved they were still gazing and tantly at something toward the north light hair entered
[00:57:05] the camp the objects seen from a distance now took distinct shapes they were raw hide meat containers
[00:57:12] willow chairs clothing containers robes and cradle boards scattered indiscriminately as if by a
[00:57:19] sudden angry wind but it hadn't been a wind someone had attacked the encampment the horses had
[00:57:27] been telling him something looking north as they had he walked over to a hobbled mayor she appeared
[00:57:34] on harm so he fashioned a jaw rope untied the hobbles swung onto her back and urged her into a
[00:57:40] lope toward the north where there had been movement earlier if the people in the camp were running
[00:57:46] away they would be moving as fast as possible in a bear patch of ground he saw the grooves
[00:57:53] left by a pair of drag poles pausing to look he saw other signs of drag poles then he saw
[00:58:01] something else even in the fading light the distinctive prints of the metal shoes worn by long
[00:58:08] knife horses unless soldiers had taken a pulling dragging poles something wasn't right throwing
[00:58:17] caution aside light hair galloped in the direction of the signs and at the second or third hill he saw
[00:58:24] them people were walking and leading a few horses pulling loaded drag poles though it was
[00:58:30] difficult to count how many they were but on either side was a column of mounted soldiers they were
[00:58:37] heading northwest most of the men from little funders camp had been away hunting some of them were
[00:58:45] bound to return sooner or later but for the time being light hair was alone he returned for his own
[00:58:52] horse so he could take too long to follow his relatives who are captives of the long knives
[00:58:59] back at the burned out camp he retrieved his gilding and gathered stones from several cooking
[00:59:05] fires and built a marker pointing it to the northwest and he wouldn't know to go in that direction
[00:59:11] especially given the condition of the camp he had only been in the south end of the camp so he
[00:59:16] led his horse through it to the north end the mayor snorted in apprehension and shied away from a
[00:59:22] long dark object on the ground light hair bent to it and felt the leg it was a woman she was dead
[00:59:31] he discerned other shapes in the growing darkness and went to them they were all dead
[00:59:40] he wretched after he bent low over a woman and realized that both her breasts had been cut off
[00:59:47] searching in the growing darkness he found one dead body after another all of them scalloped
[00:59:53] or mutilated in some fashion he wretched again and sat for some time before he pulled a row
[01:00:01] back from the next body a child this time perhaps ten gathering his horses he walked out of the camp
[01:00:11] he had covered everybody he found covering the shame of the insults they had suffered after the pain of death
[01:00:20] with the shock and the grief came another feeling starting like a small cloud growing over the
[01:00:27] horizon anger so that's gonna leave a mark you get to a point where there's a trajectory
[01:00:54] where it's almost impossible to stop the direction that things are going and when stuff happens like that
[01:01:02] what are you gonna do I mean you you you you
[01:01:12] through this book you you have a problem because there's this clash of cultures
[01:01:17] and the Lakota have a culture that that they're involved with raiding they're going up and
[01:01:23] raiding the crow they're they're raiding the uh um the snakes the snakes and the crow are
[01:01:29] raiding them back and it's just what they kind of do and there's an equilibrium there because
[01:01:35] they're not industrial and they can't like mechanize death the way the Europeans are capable
[01:01:42] at at the time yeah and they don't understand it and there's like a he doesn't say this at all
[01:01:49] but you can assemble it there's an ROI like a legit rules of engagement that they're following
[01:01:57] and you don't either there's just things that you don't do and there's times where he mentions in
[01:02:03] the book they're going to they're going on a raid to like to stay sharp yeah like hey we're just
[01:02:09] hey look this is like a training op but it's real and they're gonna go do it and and the other
[01:02:14] the other tribes kind of know that's hey this is part of what we do oh this is oh they're
[01:02:20] gonna run a training op we're gonna have to get some but there's rules of engagement and there's
[01:02:25] there's like um hey we're gonna go in we got some horses from you cool we're not slaughtering
[01:02:31] your people we got we we needed horses so we got some horses from right that's what we're doing
[01:02:37] oh we want we want you know some of the meat that you that you hunted okay cool we didn't get
[01:02:43] enough so we're gonna go take some of yours it's it's like there's rules of engagement that
[01:02:46] they're all operating on they were I think it was fairly common too when you raid like
[01:02:51] they mentioned in here and he leaves out like we attacked the village and there were no men left
[01:02:56] in the village are very few of them well what what did you do exactly and I don't think it was
[01:03:00] uncommon for them to snatch slaves up at a minimum from other villages I think you know the
[01:03:08] empire the summer moon which is another great book the command she were grabbing people from
[01:03:12] everywhere and then they would just assimilate I'm kind of in the tribe but they also did a lot of
[01:03:17] slave trading and other things at the time so there's no one that's completely clean in this whole
[01:03:26] situation and yeah it's just it's it's an interesting study that on all this stuff and how do
[01:03:36] you stop it once once that boulders rolling downhill I like you he comes in and he finds all the
[01:03:43] mutilated women like how do you put that fire out now it's gonna be rough
[01:03:54] there's a guy named harney the gizapp caramel maybe a general general general harney
[01:04:01] early in the morning soldiers had been seen moving up blue water spotted tail and iron
[01:04:08] shell and a few warrior leaders rode out under a white banner to talk of troops to talk
[01:04:14] the leader of the soldiers was a white haired man and bearded older man who said his name was
[01:04:19] general harney and they eventually put two and two together that this is the guy that led this raid
[01:04:24] or did come harney had stopped at Fort Laramie since he was the leader of the soldiers he declared
[01:04:29] an end to trading with the Lakota still demanding the surrender of the killers of grapon
[01:04:34] when the story of the attack on little funders camp on the on the blue water was carried north
[01:04:39] to the other Lakota camps general harney was given a new name to the Lakota he would always be known
[01:04:45] as woman killer so the fact that they're given him that specific name probably is an
[01:04:52] indicator that that's not common practice for them to kill him no that's not saying there's
[01:04:57] our oeze man that there were violate big time one evening he returned from a long outing with
[01:05:07] high backbone and waited for his father in the large large when crazy horse that's the dad
[01:05:12] returned the boy held out a bundle of tobacco it was a gift and offering to a holy man
[01:05:17] when one needed to speak from one's heart light hair needed to tell of a dream a dream that it
[01:05:23] come to him the second night he had spent alone on a sandstone bluff it had been with him every
[01:05:29] day and night for these many months he told his father dreams were important crazy horse said
[01:05:36] as he as he took the offering of tobacco from his oldest son so now we get into this dream
[01:05:44] the dream was not difficult to remember and this dream is like the central theme of this book so
[01:05:49] the dream was not difficult to remember only to tell it had been a part of the boy since the late
[01:05:55] summer night near the sand hill country when old conquering beer bear lay dying in camp after the
[01:06:02] incident with the soldiers with the soldier gratin in his men he was almost embarrassed to describe it
[01:06:09] the dream began at a lake a small still lake bursting upward from the blue calmness
[01:06:16] a horse and its writer broke through the surface and rode out across the land the writer was a man
[01:06:22] a slender man who wore his hair loose a stone was tied behind his left ear a reddish brown stone
[01:06:30] a lightning mark was painted across one side of his face on his bare chest were blue hailstones
[01:06:36] behind him behind them to the west as they galloped was a dark rolling cloud rising higher and higher
[01:06:43] from it came the deep rumble of thunder and flashes of lightning the horse was strong and swift
[01:06:51] and changed its colors red yellow black white and blue bullets and arrows suddenly filled the air
[01:06:59] flying at the horse and writer but they all passed without touching them close above them
[01:07:06] through a red tailed hawk sending out its shrill cry people his own kind suddenly rose up all around
[01:07:16] and grabbed the writer pulling him down from behind the dream ended there seemed to be a warning
[01:07:27] in the dream but glorious warrior in the dream was grown but still young the faces of the
[01:07:33] enemies that it sent bullets and arrows at him were not visible but the people who had pulled
[01:07:38] him down were like the writer himself they were easily seen as was the horse the hawk and the
[01:07:45] thunder's the thunder's they were the powerful beings that lived in the west perhaps the most
[01:07:52] powerful of all beings ever anywhere rarely did anyone dream of the thunder's and anyone who did
[01:07:59] had a special calling to be a sacred clown the one who did the opposite of what was expected light
[01:08:05] hered described the lightning mark on the dream writers face as well as blue hailstones painted
[01:08:12] across across his chest lightning and hail were both strongly associated with the thunder's
[01:08:20] crazy horse the door crazy horse closed the door and began singing again
[01:08:25] and another gathering song to call in the spirits he poured water on the stones sending steam
[01:08:33] and new waves of heat rolling inside the tiny enclosure light heren dirt the heat even as he had
[01:08:40] held the dream in his mind's eye as his father had instructed him to do dying gloriously
[01:08:47] making the ultimate sacrifice in defense of the people was the secret dream of every Lakota fighting
[01:08:53] man it was the warrior code repeated in all the honoring songs the dream seemed to suggest that the
[01:09:02] dreamer would gain honor and immortality by living and dying as a warrior but perhaps there was more
[01:09:09] to the dream perhaps there was a warning of a path that could not be avoided
[01:09:15] so there's a lot of foreshadowing in that dream of his life that he's not going to live very
[01:09:28] long and not going to live to old age and the scariest thing I guess is the fact that people his own
[01:09:34] kind are the people that kind of drag him down from behind
[01:09:39] and you know this this got me to thinking you know when I had when I had a mica
[01:09:50] think on the podcast and I started off by reading some stuff that he's either said or written
[01:09:58] and that was that one quote this native American quote and I don't know which tribe it came from
[01:10:06] and I didn't research it but the quote is a diagnosis becomes a curse basically when you diagnose
[01:10:16] someone with something it can become a curse a self fulfilling prophecy you know and that's
[01:10:25] something to look out for you know it's something to look out for yeah it's it's um I think it's better
[01:10:41] as we go through the story to discuss it later the struggle that the tribe has between
[01:10:47] the folks that are going to the take the free annuities and the folks that are deciding to live wild
[01:10:54] and then that friction and that friction corrods them from the inside out yeah and man the
[01:11:03] egos that come into play are just very disturbing mentioned he's a few more characters coming
[01:11:12] to play even in the company of heat dog and lone bear light hair laughed and smiled less
[01:11:16] often and didn't participate in their banter as much as he usually did this after he kind of
[01:11:20] reports his dream to his dad his friends knew that crazy horse had taken light hair off somewhere
[01:11:25] for several days and at since returning their light hair friend was less communicative but they
[01:11:31] also knew that he always tried harder to win the games the boys played to emulate warriors
[01:11:37] in fact he rarely lost he was not always the fastest or the quickest or the best shot but he
[01:11:43] simply kept trying and though he didn't tell them what to do they still followed him because
[01:11:51] he didn't hesitate to take the lead he seemed to know instinctively the best trail to follow
[01:11:57] or the best way to do something word of light hair's dream had quietly spread among the fighting
[01:12:05] men sooner later some said the boy would have to put his medicine to the test there was only one
[01:12:10] way to see if the enemies bullets and arrows would not strike him so preparations were made for
[01:12:15] raid north into crowlands crazy horse and little hawk had found a reddish brownstone for light
[01:12:21] hair to wear behind his left ear and taught him how to paint lightning and hail stone marks
[01:12:26] from his dream then a bullet gona stray while someone was practicing grazed light hairs knee
[01:12:33] it's like friendly fire scenario someone's out just training and get and crazed and light hair
[01:12:41] get shot though crazy horse says dad treated the wound carefully to him it was a sign
[01:12:48] a worrisome sign directly related to the people in the dream pulling the rider down
[01:12:53] for the dreamer there would be danger or harm from his own kind we get into the love story part of
[01:13:08] this scenario it's also tragic in many ways news is buzzing about a prominent family planning
[01:13:16] a coming out serenote ceremony for a favorite daughter there would be much feasting and dancing
[01:13:21] red cloud was an impressive figure of a man and had reputation as an orator he was the head of a
[01:13:27] large family and some would say he would be an important man for years to come so it was only natural
[01:13:33] that the people were excited that his niece black buffalo woman was to be honored
[01:13:38] as a tiny doide girl she'd cross light hairs path now and then now she was a beautiful willy
[01:13:43] girl with long glistening black hair light hair hung back as the crowd moved away and managed to
[01:13:51] catch a glimpse of her dress and a finally be to dress her hair in too long braids hanging down
[01:13:57] over her breast signifying she was now a woman that evening light hair stayed in the back of the
[01:14:02] crowd during the dancing black buffalo woman's brothers her father and her uncle stayed close to
[01:14:06] hers or a reminder that any would be suitor could count on having to prove his worth in order
[01:14:12] to become part of that family so he's got a little love interest black buffalo woman
[01:14:27] fast forward a little bit waiting for his first test to battle light hair watch for the signal
[01:14:31] from high backbone a stone's throat was right he had stripped to his breach cloth and and
[01:14:37] moccasins his hair loose in the manner of his dream and the lightning mark and hailstones painted
[01:14:42] on his chest at the back of his head he wore the tail feathers from a red tailed hawk pointing
[01:14:48] down as when the hawk was about to strike his prey behind his left ear was the reddish brown stone
[01:14:55] and his right handy held the bow two arrows against his palm and a thirmed clamped in his teeth
[01:15:00] his quiver bristling with arrows was tied to the front of his waist to be an easy reach
[01:15:08] a shout came from high backbone as he urged his his mount into a gallop to take him up the slope
[01:15:14] light hair and others did the same strangely each rider had only a vago awareness of the others
[01:15:20] though they could hear clearly dozens of hooves clathering on the rocky slope low angry sounded
[01:15:27] humming noises buzzed past their ears the the experience fighting men knew it was the sound of
[01:15:34] passing balls from enemy muzzle loaders the gunshots could be heard less than a heartbeat later
[01:15:42] a man with a gun stepped out from behind a rock light hairs shot was pure instinct and he didn't
[01:15:48] see if the arrow had hit his target his horse pitched forward the enemy who stepped from behind
[01:15:53] the rock had managed to shoot the animal in the chest light hair rolled across the rocky slope
[01:15:58] his horse was dead his bow was gone he quickly sliced the drag rope from his horse and ran down
[01:16:04] the slope first in one direction then another a loose horse came out of nowhere and he managed
[01:16:09] to grab a handful of mane and swing on there was gunfire from below an answering fire from the
[01:16:18] rocks at the top of the hill the horse was rushing up the slope in a blind panic and took his new
[01:16:24] rider among the rocks you got a commentary on grabbing a horse by the man just like that is so cool
[01:16:34] that that and it's not his horse it's just the guy so good he's grabbing any horse it comes by by the
[01:16:39] main just hopping on swing back up back into the fight the pistol he snapped off a shot with his pistol
[01:16:47] he snapped off a shot in a man who doubled over from the impact of the bullet gaining control of
[01:16:51] the horse he raised down the slope stopping to recover his bow his quiver was still tied to his waste
[01:16:56] high back bone joined him his horse winded together they charged up the slope again in and among the
[01:17:02] rocks this time light hair used his bow and put an arrow through an enemy's chest gunshots
[01:17:08] ring out from among the rocks and up from the slope bullets splattered against the boulders or
[01:17:13] shattered on small rocks on the ground unable to load another arrow light hair used his pistol again
[01:17:19] and another of the enemy went down light hair jumped from his horse to grab the hair of the dead
[01:17:24] enemy a quick swipe with his knife separated a patch of scalp as he ran toward a second body
[01:17:30] and grabbed another handful of hair a sharp smashing blow to his leg knocked him over he went down
[01:17:37] and a heap but hurly got to his feet shouts and gunfire continued bouncing off the boulders all
[01:17:43] around light hair went from boulder to boulder as gunfire waned and then he hobbled down the slope
[01:17:50] the fight was over every one of the enemies had been killed the Lakota rode among the rocks on the
[01:17:57] hill to make certain and then came down to gather around light hair most of them had seen him in the
[01:18:05] fight the bullets and arrows had not touched him except when he tried to take a second scalp
[01:18:12] his dream was true they decided high backbone took the scalps from him and cleaned the wound in his
[01:18:19] lower leg someone rounded up light hairs new horse and they all rode away from the hill a few
[01:18:25] scalps dangling from lances or belts horses and guns were the prize as well as the emergence
[01:18:34] of a new warrior among them that night around the fire the full impact of the battle settled
[01:18:41] in like an uninvited and unwelcome history men had been killed light hair killed two men
[01:18:51] the second and third human beings he had ever killed the first was the Omaha girl in the country
[01:18:57] far to the east three years past ghosts the old warrior say were the price of fighting man
[01:19:07] paid to follow the path of the warrior somewhere behind the noble and espalze traditions
[01:19:14] somewhere behind the achievements and the glory the ghosts waited and they would always be there
[01:19:22] their dying would forever be a part of the path of the man who took their lives whether the act
[01:19:30] was honorable or justified or not their faces and often their dying moments could not be forgotten
[01:19:38] unless the heart of the warrior was made of stone and few could boast of that though many might have
[01:19:45] secretly wished it to be so somewhere people they didn't know wives and daughters mothers and grand
[01:19:53] daughters would mourn they would whale and gash themselves their hearts torn in anguish
[01:20:00] the path of the warrior was indeed strewn with broken hearts like so many stones on a long and
[01:20:07] winding trail the victory dances honored the warrior and the victory story stories reaffirmed
[01:20:17] the tradition of the warrior but very little if anything could chase away the dark men or
[01:20:23] memories that always lurked the ghost would always dull the edge of arrogance and bring a cold
[01:20:31] feeling at the most unexpected moments such was the price of being a warrior
[01:20:48] you know as you read not and you think about he gets dressed up for battle you know
[01:20:59] he's they're doing their war pain and it's part of a ritual that they're going through
[01:21:05] before they go into that and I think the ritual is probably really important to the human psyche
[01:21:11] to help you set aside some of the fear and the other things and maybe it might even help you with
[01:21:17] those ghosts a little bit remember on one of the early podcasts somebody asked if you had a
[01:21:22] ritual before you went out on ops and I think there is one that a lot of people practice and it was
[01:21:29] like I'm going to change out all my batteries I'm going to get all the old battle maps out of my
[01:21:35] gear and I'm going to put the new battle map and new comp plan and I'm going to go check my
[01:21:39] radio and then we have this ritual that develops it's it's like reinforcing that we're all getting
[01:21:45] ready to go out in the battlefield because they're like one of the last things we do before we get
[01:21:48] in the vehicles are getting the helicopters is we get together and we do comp checks we're saying
[01:21:54] to each other hey I want to make sure that you know that I can talk to you and then I know that
[01:21:59] you can talk to me and when you need help I'll hear you and I'll come right and that it's a different
[01:22:06] kind of ritual but it's actually kind of the same where we present ourselves for inspection
[01:22:10] from each other like hey check my gear out and all of us sometimes some platoons run differently
[01:22:16] where they'll have one guy check it out but every platoon has a system where you present yourself
[01:22:24] and you do all these this ritual to get ready to go into combat and then you present yourself to
[01:22:28] your your teammate like hey check me out make sure I'm screwed away and and then I'll check you out
[01:22:36] and then we're in that we're kind of reaffirming all of our bonds and getting ready to go
[01:22:41] into the belly of the beast yeah it's probably worth noting as a leader to make that a little
[01:22:51] bit more ritualistic right so what can you do to make it a little bit more ritualistic and
[01:22:58] I did this my first deployment to Iraq where we would before we'd get in the vehicles it was
[01:23:04] world roll call like we would stand like we'd all stand around the board with the vehicles
[01:23:08] on it and it was you know gardener you know willing air you know just going through
[01:23:15] that roll call that yep we're all here we all know what vehicles were in this is just going out tonight
[01:23:20] and we for some reason in in in Rmadi we didn't do quite that ritualistic roll call
[01:23:31] we had come up with a more decentralized system for yep everyone's good to go you know
[01:23:36] probably just the vehicles you know one you know six up five's up four's up three's up two's up one
[01:23:41] we're good to go we don't need to have everyone stand around but as you're talking through this
[01:23:46] that little nice little ritual was a good thing and it gives you a you know I now've talked
[01:23:55] about this before the fact that in America we don't really have a ritualistic solid ritualistic
[01:24:01] to wait to deal with death there's not a protocol to follow of what you're supposed to do
[01:24:08] and it and it can I think leave a lot of open ends and a lot of loose strings because other
[01:24:14] cultures have hey this day we're going to do this kind of celebration we're going to say this prayer
[01:24:20] we're going to go to this place we're going to do this thing and then it's over it doesn't make
[01:24:26] any sense does it because dying is as natural as being born yeah and why don't we
[01:24:33] like it's just like this weird gap that we have where we haven't set up this away for us to just
[01:24:39] cope with it yeah and and and even you know we have some rituals like in the sealed teams like
[01:24:45] okay we're going to go to the funeral we're going to we're going to put the tried it you know
[01:24:49] we're going to pound our tridents into the casket like those are awesome things but it's almost like
[01:24:54] the ritual we need to have completion where you say hey once you put that tried it in the
[01:25:00] casket and you bury that casket you know now you've you've let that part of of that warrior go
[01:25:10] and now you can move forward whatever the saying should be or whatever the the ritual because
[01:25:16] you don't really know that you know no one said like hey man once you do that it's okay you've
[01:25:21] given you've given that warrior the the most respect you can give me you've given him him
[01:25:28] the most meaningful thing to you which is your trident you've given it to him you're going to
[01:25:32] bury him with your trident you're going to be with him forever and now you go back to doing your
[01:25:39] job I kind of feel that way you know I felt some level of closure when I've done that but
[01:25:46] if it was a little bit more if it was a little bit more codified it might be even more healthy
[01:25:54] for guys so I think the idea of rituals are so helpful in everyday life you know if you've
[01:26:00] got some rituals to follow me people have all kinds of little rituals they follow in everyday life
[01:26:03] right and get up I brush my teeth you know I do a certain I put on like I wear the same clothes all
[01:26:09] time to work out you know I mean I have these little rituals and I pretty much wear the same clothes
[01:26:12] every day by the way but you got these rituals like this is what I'm going to do and it makes
[01:26:18] things easier and it allows your mind to sort of follow a of a path that that is already known
[01:26:30] and I think that's really healthy and I think that would help people a lot you know
[01:26:34] it and it's what's what's so cool what's so cool is getting these windows and what's really cool
[01:26:39] about the story of crazy horses it was written by a Lakota and then we get a window into their
[01:26:45] culture it's not that much different than ours we'd grief they're talking about that their
[01:26:51] virtues are generosity and courage I think we see that as a virtue too right they come back
[01:26:58] from more they have PTSD by the way yes and so as they're talking about the things that these are
[01:27:05] holding up as high standards or things that we hold up as high standards as well yeah it's worth
[01:27:13] if you're if you're in a leadership position of the more ritual you can establish without getting
[01:27:18] crazy you know without getting crazy we don't know create rituals for no reason we also want to
[01:27:23] create rituals that become um constructive but putting some rituals in place is a positive thing
[01:27:31] definitely speaking of rituals that night there was a victory dance high backbone and the others
[01:27:41] described the battle and their parts in it for enemy warriors had been killed and by the way they were
[01:27:46] fine I didn't I did a bad job they were fighting against uh same snakes yeah it was snakes that
[01:27:51] they were fighting against snake tribe for enemy warriors had been killed guns and horses had been
[01:27:57] captured everyone waited for the son of crazy horse to tell of his deeds since according to the
[01:28:03] other men he had turned the flow of the battle but the boy hung back reluctant to talk
[01:28:10] waning with humility he goes asleep fast forward a little bit the son was high when he
[01:28:19] finally roused himself the pain in his leg had diminished somewhat and he managed to doze off a little
[01:28:25] he sipped he from the horn cup someone had left by the fire pit and finally dressed he stepped out
[01:28:29] from the lodge and was surprised to see a crowd gathered in the camp circle at the edge of
[01:28:35] it stood his father wearing his best medicine robe decorated with long strands of horse hair
[01:28:43] a trilling arose among the women his mother stood behind his father gentle smiles on their faces
[01:28:50] and unmasked pride as well crazy horse lifted his voice in a warrior's honoring song joined
[01:28:56] by his wives and light hairs sister after the song came more shouts and war hoops and trilling
[01:29:03] crazy horse lifted his hand and walked forward and faced the crowd I give my first son a new name
[01:29:10] this day he said raising his voice I have heard the story of the brave things he did I am proud
[01:29:16] his mothers are proud all of his family and friends are proud of our young man so this day I
[01:29:23] give him a new name I give him the name of his father and his fathers before him from this day
[01:29:30] forward I call him crazy horse from somewhere in the crowd a drum pounded and another honoring song
[01:29:39] was raised and the crowd surged forward high backbone little hawk he dog and lone bear were among the
[01:29:46] many who came forward smiling crazy horse the name flowed like water over the rocks
[01:30:00] there's a little ritual activity that was a whole scene I'm looking to get out staying
[01:30:04] welcome into the club man and this is equally awesome or at least get in close so the father
[01:30:13] passed on the name and took for himself another worm a name of utmost humility in time even that
[01:30:24] name would have meaning for he would be known as worm the father of crazy horse is like epic
[01:30:32] use gay is call me worm that's where we're at that's the humility level happening around here
[01:30:39] hey echo can I ask you about a movie yes of course good fellas yes there's that scene where
[01:30:46] the main character goes to jail and he's just locked up for a little time but he doesn't say anything
[01:30:53] and then when he gets let's let out everybody's yeah yeah when he was a kid that's when he's a kid
[01:31:00] pop your chair yeah yeah good good scene yeah there's something about that this is another thing we
[01:31:10] don't do great in America you're a man now type thing that ceremony that thing you're a woman now
[01:31:20] you can see they did it for for both black buffalo woman and you know like okay this is it
[01:31:25] you're you're responsible now we don't do a great job of that I went through something like that
[01:31:34] in the Catholic Church where I did confirmation and and and so different cultures have got it
[01:31:39] but as it has we've kind of morphed away from that it's something that we've lost so how do we
[01:31:45] how do we replace it and in a way it's got to be something that you earn right it's so much better
[01:31:51] if you're earning for sure for sure it shouldn't just be like okay time and rate you turned
[01:31:57] you turned seven you're a man now yeah isn't graduating high school kind of like that though yeah true
[01:32:04] I mean I guess in certain families right but you graduate high school they give you like a bunch of
[01:32:09] stuff and then your uncle or whoever gives you like advice it's like an actual thing
[01:32:14] I do lose a podcast on advice you got from your uncle when you graduated high school became a man
[01:32:21] bro that might be a whole podcast series I'm just saying you know you well oh you didn't get
[01:32:26] advice from your uncle no sir oh not me I'm just saying you have a lot of extended family or I'm
[01:32:31] grown up oh no no not really and I didn't either but that's like some people doing that's a
[01:32:36] great benefit because then there's all these adults putting good stuff into the kids here so like
[01:32:40] they you read in this book where there's everybody's talking so everything's kind of common knowledge
[01:32:46] and everybody's involved in developing well one of the things uh in Hawaii it's very common to call
[01:32:54] like if you ever respected family friend or friends that come around you call them uncle or
[01:32:58] a handy hundred percent like I didn't even know uncle was my mom and dad's brother sister or
[01:33:03] I'm gonna just like I didn't know that and so like in the do it yeah yeah but it's it feels more
[01:33:08] solidified in Hawaii because like I was like 10 maybe 11 before I realized oh wait like uncle is like
[01:33:15] if you're actually related to them yeah you just call there's people now even that I still call
[01:33:20] uncle Jill uncle whatever like you can't help it but um yeah so I mean it's in a way it's kind of
[01:33:26] this kind of same thing yeah when you go grab when you graduate they're all there and they give you
[01:33:29] you know all the stuff I get I got my lunch I got put and check on that stuff by my wife
[01:33:34] but because when I saw them it was like six and I was treating like a team guy and my wife's like
[01:33:41] he's taking six and he's like oh like well still it should still be up to three you know
[01:33:48] she just had like crushed me and I was just really sorry about that I mean you know you have to be
[01:33:54] smart enough to listen I had to think through it I had to think through it and I was like well
[01:34:00] wait a second when I was seven I realized I was like oh my god I'm an idiot because I was thinking
[01:34:07] you know why would you not just do you know why would you not get up at four in the morning
[01:34:12] and I'm like bro was I when I was seven I didn't even have any concept of any of that you know
[01:34:18] there was a little boy and there was looking at my kid like you better get up to sleep yeah
[01:34:24] don't you want to talk to you what you this candle bills for you son as you can't respond
[01:34:31] because you can't talk yet you know little kids have blankets did any of your
[01:34:38] junior kids have a blanket yeah my mom that's a big thing with my mom's she got the kids
[01:34:46] their special blanket and but it it wasn't like a security thing or not okay so one of my
[01:34:51] kid I think my um second daughter had like a blanket that went with her everywhere my first daughter
[01:34:57] not so much I didn't know what was gonna happen with my son so so I got him like this old school
[01:35:06] like S.A.S. Freaking scarf thing and I was like if you need to blink it's gonna be freaking
[01:35:11] tactical you know what he rejected he never had a he never had like that that uh he never utilized it
[01:35:19] really yeah well no no he was my one of my daughter that had the blanket that really
[01:35:26] carried it everywhere it was what is it called knitted it was knitted it had kind of like big
[01:35:33] croissants had big knots so you could kind of he should constantly be uh fumbling with them right
[01:35:39] more like so yeah so but and the S.A.S. thing kind of had some little things that said you know that'll
[01:35:44] be you know helps the dexterity or work on dexterity young age you want to be working
[01:35:48] your grip strength so in my life like you are such a wrecking idiot so there you go yeah but he was
[01:35:56] definitely your son from straight away because I remember him coming over early on and I had like a
[01:36:01] hatchet laying around and you're like my you can't have that hatchet he had he'd already grabbed
[01:36:07] and he got it from a real quick right before our pop belly picked right to eat him.
[01:36:12] My favorite cameo we saw one of our old neighbors a great friends of the family great great
[01:36:18] people and they were like yeah we were looking through pictures the other day and he had a picture
[01:36:23] of my kid at he had walked over to their house and he's like six and he's got a naked Barbie
[01:36:32] hammer and a nail he says can Shane come and play and there and Darren goes yeah he can hold on a second
[01:36:41] and went and took a picture. This is just too awesome he's simply can pour a little Barbie dolls
[01:36:46] about to get crucified twisted times okay going back to the book there there's a they're doing a
[01:36:56] raid once again on the snakes you know to your point Jason this is what they were doing
[01:37:01] yeah it's not like all the all the the Indians were out there comb by odd just you know living in
[01:37:07] peace and harmony they were killing each other and that's what's going on here um they got a raid
[01:37:13] they're on a raid on the snakes it's going sideways crazy horse found good cover boots soon surrounded
[01:37:19] and his horse had been captured incoming fire prevented him from reloading his rifle without a
[01:37:23] horse his odds of survival were greatly reduced his best chance was to move out of harm's way but he
[01:37:28] knew he had that quickly the sound of distant gunfire was growing fainer meaning the herd of new
[01:37:34] Lakota horses and most of the raiders were now well to the north he and a few of the other Lakota's
[01:37:40] in the trees were left on their own with more snakes arriving moving from tree to tree he waited
[01:37:47] for a snake warrior to pass close and jump behind him onto the horse dispatching the man with one
[01:37:53] swing of his stone headed war club do any commentary on that besides us yeah how are you
[01:38:04] jumping onto the horse that's just like athletic prowess as well pulling out his pistol the
[01:38:11] open fire to distract the snake circling outside the trees and shouted for the Lakota to make
[01:38:16] their escape making the break from the trees crazy horse and his companions gained a good head start
[01:38:21] before the snakes could regroup the snakes continued to pursue the herd and at one point managed
[01:38:26] to recover a few of their horses but they had lost several more men and soon disengaged never in
[01:38:32] recent memory had the Ogilawla Lakota taken so many horses in one raid but they had suffered
[01:38:39] losses as well with at least five men killed victory stories abounded and the dances went far
[01:38:46] into the night the Lakota learned that one of the snake casualties was the son of their head man
[01:38:51] the young man had been one of the first to pursue the Lakota once more young crazy horse did not
[01:38:58] participate in the dancing in fact he said nothing even to his father about the new horse he was
[01:39:04] riding or the new muzzle loaded loading rifle he had brought back warm could only guess how is
[01:39:10] son of the choir them until one of crazy horses companions who had been in the trees surrounded
[01:39:15] by the snakes told him what he had witnessed that the young man had unhorsed the snake and
[01:39:22] captured the gun in one daring moment his action had saved them all the man was certain
[01:39:32] this is just a good methodology for life if you talk about how awesome you are you're degrading
[01:39:41] your level of respect as a human so just don't do it it's just better just to not say anything
[01:39:53] awesome is that is this situation because crazy horse just rolls back in with a brand new horse
[01:40:00] a brand new rifle and doesn't even tell us that that he did this thing and he has to hear it second hand
[01:40:05] 12 years of one-on-one instruction provided by provided any Lakota male the basic physical skills
[01:40:17] to be a fighting man by the age of 15 or 16 any boy was proficient with all of his weapons
[01:40:22] but unseen factors determined how each would be warrior would handle live combat
[01:40:28] after the first few encounters with enemies on the battlefield young crazy horse had demonstrated
[01:40:34] qualities that he looted many men for an entire lifetime older experienced men while initially
[01:40:40] impressed waited to pass judgment however it was not usual for young men to perform well in their
[01:40:47] first face to face encounters with enemies if for no other reason then that their inexperienced
[01:40:52] made them less cautious then the daunting realities of combat became part of their thinking
[01:40:58] and the same young men who seemed so daring and reckless and their first few outings hesitated
[01:41:03] taking stock before taking action caution was good it turned reckless boys into thinking man and a
[01:41:09] thinking man was overall more valuable on the battlefield than one who placed others in danger
[01:41:15] because he took unnecessary risks so the old man who heard so the old man who heard of the first
[01:41:22] exploits of young crazy horse not at knowingly remembering that such and such had started the same
[01:41:28] way and now he was a man with a family because there was little more to life than glory on the battlefield
[01:41:36] some wisdom from these from these folks they know what's up the reckless
[01:41:43] die young the old men advised and their only legacy is a brief moment of glory but it's over time
[01:41:48] it's forgotten it is the steady and the steadfast that prevail the old one say so while it's
[01:41:54] started the heart and the imagination to hear of the exploits of a new young warrior one whose quiet
[01:42:00] ways and camp contradicted the stories of daring on the battlefield the old men puffed on their
[01:42:05] pipes as they sat around the evening fires and not at knowingly over time young crazy horse
[01:42:12] would give up his reckless ways they said everyone does not quiet everyone
[01:42:21] meanwhile the lines of suitors at the lodge of black buffalo woman were as long as ever
[01:42:31] she's square it away and the town or the village is kind of taking notice at time went by
[01:42:40] even the staunch of skeptics agreed that black buffalo woman and the stalwart young crazy horse
[01:42:45] were a good match and that she would do well to bring such a man into her family
[01:42:48] but there were still many whispers behind the hand that her family had plans that didn't take
[01:42:55] the girl's own feelings into consideration one of the suitors was no water
[01:43:02] who of his own accord was by no was no comparison to crazy horse but no water's older brother
[01:43:09] black twin was a skilled orator and a man of growing influence and he held many opinions
[01:43:16] solidly in line with those of red cloud so no water was suddenly a valuable man
[01:43:22] there was nothing for anyone to do but wait and watch with great interest
[01:43:27] has to what would happen so you got crazy horse he's sort of the
[01:43:33] he's like the warrior in this scenario and then no water who has a little bit of prestige
[01:43:39] some family connections and there's a there's a mystery as to what's going to happen and who's going to end up
[01:43:47] getting black buffalo woman
[01:43:52] going out the field again scouts from one of the camps along the powder river met the returning
[01:43:56] warriors and were quickly sent back to spread the news of success but before he left
[01:44:04] one of the scouts let slip a bit of news from the red cloud camp that was like an arrow into the
[01:44:09] heart of young crazy horse no water the younger brother of black twin had become the husband
[01:44:15] of black buffalo woman out on deployment and he was supposed to go on that deployment and
[01:44:23] suddenly got it two things yeah he got a two thing all about to the camp and then even Mary
[01:44:29] black buffalo woman dirty trick joddy always there a stain in camp yeah
[01:44:34] uh the grain of hope that light hair dared to allow himself hold to hold in his heart
[01:44:42] had grown into distinct possibility when as crazy horse he joined a line of y'all of hopefully
[01:44:48] young men waiting outside the girls lodge that grain of hope had grown even more each time she stood
[01:44:53] with him under his courting robe and seemed reluctant to leave his embrace or perhaps it was only
[01:44:59] as imagination this would not be the first time imagination totally ignored his imagination totally
[01:45:06] ignored the boundaries and limits of reality so he's gets heartbroken half a month later you return
[01:45:15] fast forward a little bit uh crazy horse said nothing of the trail he had traveled for nearly
[01:45:22] a month that for nearly half a month warm new that the broken heart was not completely healed
[01:45:27] the perhaps never would be but he knew as all fathers do that sometimes the best medicine for
[01:45:34] such a wound was life itself some good advice right there yeah because he'd left he'd gone out
[01:45:39] kind of just on his own for a few weeks to get get over the the heartbreak you know's a little bit
[01:45:47] of rating all one is out of two yeah just just just some little operations
[01:45:52] up um more good comments here a wound on the outside can be watched to see that it heals
[01:46:01] well as everyone knew wounds on the on inside could not be seen but for pain in the eyes
[01:46:07] several months had passed since black buffalo woman had taken no waters or husband soon after they
[01:46:13] had moved away for as everyone knew no water was afraid of crazy horse the old women knew
[01:46:20] that best of all but if they're young man as they called crazy horse bore any ill will it could
[01:46:26] not be seen in the way he conducted himself or heard in any words he had spoken so they hoped
[01:46:31] that the wound inflicted by black buffalo woman was healed though some didn't blame her she was
[01:46:38] after all only 16 and how could one so young stand up to the powerful ambitions of her father
[01:46:43] and uncle um rolling into the back and one of the reflections sections here and and again um
[01:46:54] skipping a bunch of stuff um but wanted to talk about this part where he says where Marshall says
[01:47:02] the seeking of a vision is a serious highly ritualized process undertaken respectfully
[01:47:07] prayerfully and under the guidance of a medicine man to seek a vision is to seek guidance for
[01:47:12] one's life or to answer a problem or predicament young light hair was probably afraid that the
[01:47:17] dream he had that night he spent a top of sandstone but but but would not be taken seriously
[01:47:25] because he had not followed all the rules but it came nonetheless the dream that vision has been
[01:47:31] told and retold thousands of times since the fact of the matter is that we cannot be certain of the
[01:47:36] exact description of light hair that light hair later gave to his father further more
[01:47:41] discrradical to understand that much of the discussion and interpretation of the vision has occurred
[01:47:46] and is still occurring since crazy horse death there are those who see the vision as a foretelling
[01:47:52] almost a blow by blow revelation of what lay ahead for light hair it depicts an powerful
[01:47:57] locata warrior rising out of the lake during a thunderstorm on a horse that changes colors
[01:48:01] riding on skewed through a hail of arrows and bullets until he's eventually pulled down by his
[01:48:05] own kind grabbing and holding back his arms the vision might have been as much a consequence of
[01:48:13] wishful thinking as it is a glimpse into the future for every locata boy grew up with dreams of
[01:48:18] being a warrior and winning glory and honor on the battlefield light hair was no different one
[01:48:23] elderly locata story teller was the opinion that light hair and his father chose not to tell
[01:48:29] everything about the vision speculating that a warning was part of it a warning that the boy would
[01:48:34] die as a young man in his prime such a warning could explain crazy horses daring and often
[01:48:41] reckless exploits in combat as a younger fighting man perhaps he believed each time he was about
[01:48:48] to perform the last act of his life and wanted to be powerful and meaningful
[01:48:54] now man the guy's got a broken heart at this point and essentially like they're talking about
[01:49:00] these other warriors get a family in that now they got something to lose and crazy horse doesn't
[01:49:07] it's like the classic but I don't want to take that take that away from his courage or bravery
[01:49:12] or anything else either yeah the classic you know team guy on the ragged edge with nothing
[01:49:18] to lose so I have that's like hey ready to go getting back into the story crazy horse decided to see
[01:49:29] for himself how things were at for laryming he found a loafer camp which is these are like
[01:49:35] Indian camps that are right outside and they're friendly with the whites and make deals with the
[01:49:39] whites and they kind of live off the whites they're all loafers he found a loafer camp a short
[01:49:43] way from the fort and stayed with them a few days to hear what they knew a newbies were laid again
[01:49:49] they complained and the long horn cattle were skinnier every year they noticed not without
[01:49:54] some degree of envy that while crazy horse carried a rifle and a pistol and a far-seeing glass
[01:50:00] he was not dressed in white man's clothes as they were he reminded them he was a hunter
[01:50:06] though some of them took this remark as an insult others knew that living off the promises
[01:50:12] of the annuities was not really living but white man named burdo could speak locota very well
[01:50:22] and he was surprised to see someone from the northern camps among the loafers he told crazy horse
[01:50:27] that more soldiers were coming to be posted at laryme he knew this because the whites had a way of
[01:50:33] talking over great distances that much much faster than letters carried by stage coaches
[01:50:38] and the pony riders they had a tapping language which by which they sent messages along a
[01:50:44] wire faster than even the prairie falcon could fly
[01:50:55] now what starts happening is there's there's they start a fine gold look for gold discover gold
[01:51:00] and there's people heading north of elk river to find gold north of the shell river and these are
[01:51:12] super intrusive right and here we go after several days travel north of shell river the
[01:51:20] people in the gold seeking train woke a woke to an unexpected sight they were surrounded by hundreds
[01:51:27] of mounted locota and sci-yella fighting men positioned on the hills and ridges around them
[01:51:36] the trail north and south was blocked the blockators stayed out of rifle range and didn't
[01:51:41] make any aggressive moves simply maintaining their positions as the day wore on a ring of men
[01:51:46] and horses seeming to have risen out of the rocks after nightfall a ring of small fires burned
[01:51:52] morning light revealed the blockators were still in place days and nights passed into five and then
[01:51:59] six so these these these big train wagon train is up looking for gold and the the Indians
[01:52:10] team up they team up and they surround them super strategic what they're doing
[01:52:17] super strategic because they're not they're not but they're not killing all the women and children
[01:52:22] is which is going to commit everybody to something they're just like hey and I'm sure those people
[01:52:29] must have been horrified horrified he says here there are only two ways for the whites to go
[01:52:36] continue north of return south if the soldiers came and tried to take gold seekers north
[01:52:41] but locota and sci-yella what attack it was decided if they turned back south they would be
[01:52:47] allowed to return hopefully with knowledge that powder river country would not be another trail
[01:52:53] for the whites whatever their purpose or destination and then some soldiers come and thankfully
[01:53:01] they turn they turn the train south and this is what I think is an important piece crazy horse
[01:53:07] would always remember the strange episode on the snake steak to trail especially in light of
[01:53:12] what all that was to follow he carried a lesson from it that he would use as a measure every time
[01:53:17] he looked to the trails a fighting man all the warriors on the ridges surrounding the gold
[01:53:22] seekers had invoked a feeling of virtue of simply coming together a feeling of strength that
[01:53:29] comes from pursuing the same purpose several hundred had responded some from the Sahelia and perhaps
[01:53:37] a few blue clouds married into locota families he knew several by name but most were unknown to him
[01:53:45] on those windstrap wind swept ridges for six days however they had shared the kinship of purpose
[01:53:52] so incredibly in person important lesson for him unifying people and working together towards a common goal
[01:54:01] that's an opportunity yeah and and so when people feel like they're part of the group
[01:54:10] they're capable of so much more and so that means that no matter what you do make sure
[01:54:17] that everybody feels included on the team it's that easy I have a simple statement about this
[01:54:23] together we are stronger and if you can keep that in mind it's it actually is like it's covered
[01:54:28] move because with cover move you get to far apart now we can't cover move for each other together
[01:54:33] we are stronger if you keep that in mind whenever things are happening think a together we're
[01:54:36] stronger that's the way you want to go and that's the lesson he learned here fast forward a little
[01:54:43] bit summer past lazily and people talked about making presence to the buffalo scouts and sending
[01:54:48] them out looking so the so the planning for the autumn hunts could be made as the first heavy
[01:54:55] snow's fell troubling news came from far south from the sajilia who lived along the southern fork
[01:55:04] of the shell river soldiers it was always the soldiers 300 people had been killed at a place called
[01:55:10] sand creek most of them sajila and some blue clouds led by black kettle and white antelope
[01:55:18] both leaders were regarded as wise and always working for peace the killing was bad enough because
[01:55:23] those killed were mostly women and children but the soldiers who attacked did more than kill
[01:55:30] the white agent trusted by black kettle and white antelope had advised them to find a place to
[01:55:36] pitch their lodges that was away from the main trails it was told there were many whites in that
[01:55:42] part of the country many living in a large town called Denver and there was a hatred among them
[01:55:48] for the sajila and people of the earth the camp was to fly the white banner of peace as well as
[01:55:56] the striped banner of the long knives to signify they were peaceful but the soldiers found them
[01:56:03] and the banners meant nothing the messengers could barely tell the story trying to keep back the
[01:56:10] anger and the tears as well as the bile that rose in the throat for remembering women and children
[01:56:15] were butchered after they were killed it was told parts of their bodies were cut away such as a
[01:56:20] woman's breasts and genitalia's a child's hand or fingers and boys genitalia's
[01:56:26] brains were bashed out with gun stocks and eyes were gouged out some babies not yet burned
[01:56:35] born were cut from their mother's stomachs the final insult came when the soldiers attached
[01:56:40] body parts to their blue coats and rode in a victory march through the streets of the large
[01:56:46] town as the other whites cheered the Lakota did not want to believe the news not because they
[01:56:53] wanted to deny the truth of it but because it was much too difficult to believe that anyone could do
[01:57:00] such unspeakable deeds
[01:57:08] sancryk masker um i did a podcast about that with
[01:57:15] denyeli beleli and derral kuper we we talked about the mili masker in the sancryk masker and it's
[01:57:21] just a freaking nightmare all the whites were not worthy enemy now and that thought was
[01:57:32] carried with guns, lances, war clubs and bows as angry men rode out from the great camp
[01:57:39] the Lakota swept to the northeast the sahelia to the northwest and the blue clouds swirled
[01:57:46] like hornets in between, waystations soldier soldier posts and tra- any travelers along the
[01:57:55] holy road or any frequented by whites were the objectives young men took addmonitions of their
[01:58:00] elders too heart as they hardened themselves to mercy and remembered sand creek the spirit of revenge
[01:58:09] rolled with the thunder from hooves of war horses across the frozen prairies crazy horse
[01:58:17] joined the second attack on julesburg but the whites were reluctant to meet them face to face
[01:58:23] in the open so there there was no fighting to speak of they left the post ablaze after taking
[01:58:28] all they could carry from the storehouses
[01:58:32] so they go and they're just out doing these raids and just getting after essentially right now
[01:58:44] we're at total war and yes we are and here's the disturbing thing is those soldiers at
[01:58:55] sand creek they were you know not connected to the soldiers that were in Montana not connected
[01:59:03] the soldiers that he's at the fourth day and no what had happened and or maybe they knew what happened
[01:59:07] but they I'm sure some of them said oh what the hell's going on with that just and so now you had
[01:59:13] you have the whites that are that have been looking at all the Indians as the same I mean
[01:59:20] I guess maybe not because they they are they are have some like the crows they work with the
[01:59:26] crows directly but you're starting to see the two sides divide and it's you're either on this
[01:59:30] side or that side and that's it and we're going to take vengeance on if you're white you're you're
[01:59:36] getting attacked yeah and rightly so and that's very defender of the people then that's what
[01:59:44] you you have to do and just turn it to a trishon warfare yeah and it's just it's not it's just escalation
[01:59:53] and it's not going to stop so they're out doing these raids who are going in these battles
[02:00:00] crazy horse continues to distinguish himself here's here so here's something that occurs they
[02:00:08] had not succeeded in wiping out the soldiers because a few impetuous young men couldn't hold
[02:00:14] themselves back for the right moment this was on an ambush and some of the young guys went hard
[02:00:20] early and so it was a problem that had had to be corrected if they were to defeat the whites
[02:00:27] they all agreed and one way to solve the problem was to find strong young men to lead the others
[02:00:32] for that they said perhaps they should renew the tradition of the shirt wearers
[02:00:37] some people scoffed at such talk no shirt wearers had been selected for a generation because the
[02:00:43] purpose behind the tradition had been forgotten a shirt wearer was to be a young man of strong
[02:00:49] action and good ways one to set the example for others instead the tradition had become the father
[02:00:55] choosing his son to wear the shirt next better to let it be some said instead of dishonoring a good
[02:01:01] thing so they they used to have hey if you were a badass you'd get this shirt but then eventually
[02:01:07] became you know oh it's my son I'm gonna get him hook him up little hawk was growing into a daring
[02:01:15] fighter already winning several war honors but the most perplexing and heavy change was symbolized
[02:01:20] in the shirt made from a height of a big horn sheep now rolled in a decorated case and waiting
[02:01:27] his parent in his parents lodge also waiting with the duties and responsibilities that came with it
[02:01:32] the old man leaders had indeed decided to revive the old the old tradition of shirt wearers
[02:01:40] and as expected the shirts were given to young men of important families so they do end up saying
[02:01:46] all right we're gonna make some shirt wearers the choice of young men the choice of young man
[02:01:51] whose enemies are afraid of his horses sword or long knife horse aka an american horse surprise no one so
[02:01:58] that's a bunch of guys that were you know from from important families but with the name of crazy
[02:02:04] horse was announced it was announced a gasp went through the crowd and the shouts the whoops
[02:02:11] and the trilling that followed with the labyrinth of all he felt truly honored yet was uncertain
[02:02:16] that he was a good choice later two more shirt wearers were chosen and he was pleased that his
[02:02:23] friend he dog was one the other was big road a good strong and honorable man to wear shirts
[02:02:32] you must be men above all others said an old man chosen to speak you must help others before you
[02:02:39] think of yourselves help the widows and those who have little to wear and to eat and have no one
[02:02:46] to help them or speak for them do not look down on others or see those who look down on you
[02:02:54] and do not let anger guide your mind or your heart be generous be wise and show fortitude
[02:03:04] so that the people can follow what you do and then what you say above all have courage and be the
[02:03:12] first to charge the enemy for it is better to lie a warrior naked in death than to be wrapped up well
[02:03:20] with the heart of water inside so that's an expanded version of what you were talking about earlier
[02:03:31] when they talked about the we that this idea of the shortwars and again what do they talk about
[02:03:39] I mean they opened it up with think of others before you think of yourselves that's the that's the
[02:03:46] that's the opener you know as and essentially they're choosing their officers right yeah
[02:03:52] and it's pretty cool because well I guess part of it they're doing it by birth because they're like
[02:03:58] oh you're from an important family kind of like we did it and then they're like you know
[02:04:04] where was a college degree or landowners are gonna be officers everybody else is enlisted and then
[02:04:11] and then by actual prowess merit merit for crazy horse you know and then then you serve
[02:04:20] others before you serve yourself and there's a tradition the Marine Corps has that's freaking awesome
[02:04:28] and that's at the officer eats last that is is similar in that leaders eat last
[02:04:37] that's as it should be you know as it should be fast forward a little bit calling the young
[02:04:45] men together high backbone scolded them for causing the ambush to fail this is after they
[02:04:49] obviously just failed on an ambush the young men listened without protests as he reminded them
[02:04:53] that fighting the whites was not a war for glory but a war for survival you reminded them of
[02:05:01] sand creek when he finished there was a loud affirmation but an even louder one came after
[02:05:05] he announced his plan for another ambush most of the fighting men would hide themselves and their
[02:05:10] horses in the ridges and gullies on either side of the wagon trail from prairie dog Greek to
[02:05:15] lodge trail ridge a small group would attack the wood gathers who always went out from the fort by
[02:05:21] wagon in the morning when the soldiers came out to drive the attackers away 10 decoys would show
[02:05:26] themselves and lead them toward lodge trail ridge and then north down us down to a slope ending
[02:05:32] in a meadow before prairie dog creek when the signal was given the hiding warriors were attacked
[02:05:38] and not before or and not before or the ambush would be spoiled the soldiers had to believe that
[02:05:45] only 10 doig decoys were fighting them most important to the plan were the decoys if they failed
[02:05:52] several hundred fighting men would be denied the opportunity for victory therefore the decoys needed
[02:05:58] a strong leader one skilled in warfare with proven judgment in battle the leader of the decoys
[02:06:04] would be crazy horse the cries and shelter affirmation rang through camp and fighting man
[02:06:10] young and old crowded around to put their names in as one of the other nine
[02:06:20] they do some preparation then the attack came well away from the fort but still within sight
[02:06:25] so the Lakota could be sea surrounding the wax could be seen surrounding the wagon so these
[02:06:30] are the decoys going in action after initial charge the attackers kept the wagon men and escort
[02:06:37] riders engaged the gunfire sounded especially sharp in the frigid mountain air soon the western
[02:06:42] gates swung open a column of mounted and walking soldiers appeared the Lakota attackers kept up
[02:06:48] the firing making sure the rescue column was well out of the fort as the soldiers passed their
[02:06:53] thicket crazy horse and his decoys charged so this is like going as perfect to plan as it could go
[02:07:01] fortunately enough of the decoys fortunately enough of the decoys had a few bullets that they could
[02:07:06] fire several shots to make it seem like an all-out attack crazy horse shot a few arrows when he
[02:07:11] was close enough to see the hairy faces of some of the soldiers for some moments the soldiers
[02:07:17] seemed confused then they finally opened fire uneven snow covered the cover over the frozen ground
[02:07:25] and dangerously frigid air with the decoys decore warriors first obstacles and bullets humming
[02:07:31] past them like angry bees reminded them that they had a daunting task ahead and a long way to
[02:07:36] finish it the first few mounted soldiers turned off the trail to pursue them and the rest of the
[02:07:41] column fell and slowly behind them fainting head on charges the decoys would swerve at the last moment
[02:07:48] well within range of the soldier guns they took the soldier north the soldiers north over the
[02:07:53] frozen snow fields at one point some of the decoys including crazy horse had to ride down a
[02:07:58] treacherously steep frozen slope the soldiers took the gentler slope of the south face and kept
[02:08:04] pursuing an open valley with thick stand of trees on either side of the creek lay ahead with no
[02:08:10] serious obstacles to impede the soldier's advance once across the creek the warriors turned straight
[02:08:16] north and came inside of large trail ridge the walking soldiers were slowing down the column
[02:08:22] crazy horse dismounted well within rifle range pulled out a knife and calmly scraped the ice
[02:08:28] from the bottom of his horses hooves when bullets began to ricochet closer and closer he
[02:08:33] remounted and loped away the other decoys to infuriate the soldiers used similar tactics fast forward a
[02:08:45] little bit on the ridge i think i want to say i read that this was about a multi mile like a
[02:08:51] five mile trail they had to make a move five miles they had to get pursued for five miles on the ridge
[02:09:01] the soldiers hesitated perhaps waiting for some to catch up the decoys renewed their efforts
[02:09:06] coaxing their tired horses part way up the slope moving dangerously close one pretended to be
[02:09:12] shot off his horse and immediately bounced up running behind the horse before skillfully
[02:09:16] remounting from the back crazy horse had picked the right men for the task at hand for crazy horse
[02:09:22] and the decoys this was the decisive moment if the waiting ambushers attacked prematurely
[02:09:28] soldiers could still escape the decoys looked left and right as they proceeded north along a very
[02:09:34] narrow part of the ridge but could see no movement below the slope of the ridge falling away before
[02:09:41] them was the winding prairie dog creek and the end of their task now the soldiers were pressing
[02:09:47] harder increasing their gunfire obviously certain that the decoys comprised the entire enemy force
[02:09:53] crazy horse formed his men into a skirmish line and those with bullets had sp- with bullets to
[02:09:59] spare fired at the oncoming soldiers drawing into a heavy drawing in heavy return fire
[02:10:06] the decoys raced their horses down the slippery slope forming two lines as they rode they
[02:10:13] crossed the flats to prairie dog creek east line of riders swinging out wide and then crossing
[02:10:18] each other on the opposite side of the creek this was the signal to attack from out of the very
[02:10:26] earth itself came the awaiting ambushers horses and men burst from the gullies cutbacks and what
[02:10:33] little winter shrubbery was there in a heartbeat several hundred fighting men rose road south
[02:10:40] some from the east and some from the west those closest to lodge trail ridge quickly shut the
[02:10:46] soldiers escape route back to the fort the soldiers advanced stopped then they instinctively began to
[02:10:53] fight their to fight to reach the safety of the fort the walking soldiers were shrung out to the back
[02:11:00] closer to lodge trail ridge they were the first to fall as gunfire blasted up the slopes below
[02:11:07] them there was no end of the guns firing the soldiers fought hard as they retreated up the ridge
[02:11:13] but there was nothing to be gained they were cut off with nowhere to go wave after wave of
[02:11:19] the mounted warriors fought their way up the treacherous slopes those with guns used up their bullets
[02:11:24] and then resorted to their bows some had only bows and arrows arrows flew up from the east slope
[02:11:30] and from the west the sky was dark with them and some found their mark in the body of a Lakota
[02:11:35] or Sahila toward the end the warriors waited in among the dead and dying soldiers killing
[02:11:42] them with a pistol shot or a hard skillful swing of a war club or the deadly thrust of a lance
[02:11:50] and then always quiet all the soldiers were dead
[02:11:55] it began with the Sahilia as they remembered sand creek and what had been done to their
[02:12:04] relatives when the frenzy ended the soldiers were stripped naked fingers were chopped off
[02:12:10] belly slashed open eyes gouged out many warriors were wounded but fewer than 15 had been killed
[02:12:28] kind of a kind of a perfect operation really I mean it sounds us like a textbook operation
[02:12:34] and those soldiers got lored out I think they're ended up being 80 of them
[02:12:41] and they were all killed and then mutilated
[02:12:47] fast forward a little bit snow came and winter passed a loafer brought word from the peace
[02:12:54] talkers they had come with more presence kettles blankets knives and now guns and they were
[02:13:01] asking for red cloud to come and sign the papers that all the Lakota could share in these gifts
[02:13:06] so there could be peace in the power powder river counter the peace talkers had come with a new
[02:13:12] offer as well all the country from the great muddy river to the shining mountains would be
[02:13:16] Lakota land so long as the rivers shall flow and the grass grows where the whites
[02:13:23] where did the whites get the power to give the Lakota lands they already controlled crazy horse
[02:13:28] heard many old men ask crazy horse horse road north raid the crow's he returned with new horses
[02:13:38] and to news that his uncle spotted tail had his own lands to live on given him to him by the whites
[02:13:45] agency it was called crazy horse pondered this news even as red cloud road south to fort letter me
[02:13:53] with a new power of his own he made a mark next to his name on the white man's piece of paper
[02:14:00] and that was the fort letter me treaty of 1868
[02:14:10] it's you know if you can get some people compromise and you can make some people and win some
[02:14:15] people over you can divide people yeah right there's there's just done yeah there's a funny discussion
[02:14:26] in there where they're like how how is red cloud sign the way our land yeah oh he is well hey
[02:14:34] I'm gonna sign away my brother and laws lodging yeah yeah there it doesn't make sense to them right
[02:14:41] doesn't it's just again it's like hey Jason I'll give you money for your for your air you go well
[02:14:48] okay what about put do you want to buy echoes there too I can sign for echoes there yeah I'll buy that too
[02:14:54] or you know I look at that one's air he got your air you know Jason sold it to me you're like what what just happened
[02:15:00] you know but at the end of the day those guys whatever their motivations were
[02:15:14] they kind of saw the writing on the wall and they got on the winning side and so they were trying to
[02:15:18] carve themselves out even though you know they're maybe they're they're betrayers or they are betraying
[02:15:25] the other locato but um it's that change thing again yeah likes it yeah you sometimes got to
[02:15:35] change that horse you know returning from a hunt crazy horse stopped in the camp of no water to rest
[02:15:46] since the great gathering below elk mountain two years past he had spoken to black buffalo
[02:15:51] woman several times whatever had been between them and long past she was the mother of three now
[02:15:57] and seemed entirely proper for him to ask about her children but each time they talked they lingered
[02:16:04] longer something that did not go unnoticed by someone who knew what had happened before so now
[02:16:09] black black buffalo woman waited discreetly for the gift of elk teeth crazy horse had lately been
[02:16:16] leaving for her with someone but as he was preparing to leave she approached openly and brought him food
[02:16:23] and they stood together talking he left not lingering too long but as he rode away some notice
[02:16:28] that she watched until he was out of sight warm spoke and there's there's some
[02:16:40] some talk about what was going to happen with black buffalo woman there's obviously a
[02:16:44] rekindling of this thing of this relationship of this this uh this love at first sight that they had
[02:16:52] had warm spoke nonetheless because much wrote on the shoulders of his son much that was important
[02:16:59] to the people they will not let her go he said quietly fast forward a little bit one morning
[02:17:07] after victory dances whispers flew through camp black buffalo woman had left her children with
[02:17:14] relatives and rode out beside the light-haired one no two people could agree over this new turn
[02:17:22] some said it was a coming for a long time since her father had made the choice of a husband for
[02:17:26] her when her heart belonged to the shy quiet young man who is now the most powerful warrior among them
[02:17:33] others said there would be trouble though she was a good Lakota woman free to choose her husband
[02:17:38] was not one to let her have that choice besides the reasons her father and uncle had influenced her
[02:17:44] choice of a husband were even more important now some said cautiously and they were right
[02:17:51] the couple and their friends came to a small camp in a narrow little valley and there they rested
[02:17:57] little shield he dogs brother and little big man were among were along and made a feast as night
[02:18:03] fell there came a commotion and a man torn into the lodge where crazy horse and black buffalo
[02:18:09] woman were guests a man worn from a hard trail and driven by anger of a jealous heart
[02:18:18] no water stood above them a pistol in hand as crazy horse leap to his feet
[02:18:26] the pistol boomed
[02:18:28] so got a little love triangle going on no water's not happy and maybe I didn't cover it but
[02:18:41] the tradition was if the woman wanted a divorce she could do that he was up to her and and the
[02:18:47] man was supposed to respect it but everyone kind of knew that no water was not the kind of guy
[02:18:52] that was going to let this slide it appears that there's like there's a lot of politics involved
[02:18:57] with this marriage and it was an arranged marriage which is kind of outside the norm too
[02:19:04] yeah incredibly tragic story so
[02:19:10] luckily enough back to the book he awoken in a lodge unfamiliar to him but knew the strong old face that
[02:19:16] appeared as his eye cleared and he could see one I was still swollen along with the left side of his
[02:19:22] face old spotted crow his uncle the brother of long face not a degrading and held him down
[02:19:27] as he tried to sit up she is back with her people the old man said and answered the question
[02:19:32] on his face my cousin bad heart bull made it so no one will harm her he'd been in and out of sleep
[02:19:39] for three days he was told the swelling on his face had gone down a little but he would have a
[02:19:44] scar where the bullet had opened his face from the corner of his nose down to the jaw line
[02:19:49] there will be black powder in the scar from the pistol warm had indicated
[02:19:53] to very fine horses were tied outside his uncle's lodge sent by no water as a gesture of peace
[02:20:02] take them his father advised to soften the anger of those who would take revenge in your name
[02:20:09] so he did and the young men who wanted no water turned over to them set aside their anger
[02:20:16] and put away their bows and guns then one night the young men who had gone into snake
[02:20:24] country with little hawks slipped back into camp sorry I'm fast forward a little bit
[02:20:29] the raiding so before we go there he he humbles himself basically he humbles himself the guy
[02:20:38] comes to kill him shoot him in the face he happens to live and instead of starting a freaking war
[02:20:47] he says all right you know what I accept the horses there's just for some forgiveness and acceptance
[02:20:54] and everybody can move on yep so fast forward a little bit now then one night the young man
[02:21:04] who had gone into snake country with little hawks slipped back into camp the raiding against the
[02:21:09] snakes did not go well on the way home little hawk was killed by whites in an unexpected attack
[02:21:16] the news was like a war club to the stomach as his mother's began to weep softly crazy horse
[02:21:22] went out to stand alone in the night his brother had been killed while he had been chasing after
[02:21:28] his own selfish needs so I don't I don't probably failed to make that clear but little hawk
[02:21:38] we've mentioned a few times was his was crazy horses little brother and so while crazy horses
[02:21:44] going through this drama and injury and recovery they go out on the raid and his little brother
[02:21:50] out with I think is out with him out without his older brother for the first time dies
[02:22:02] the next day he saw no water unloading meat at the lodge of a relative
[02:22:08] seeming to sense crazy horses anger no water jump on his horse and galloped out of camp
[02:22:13] perhaps unable to contain his anguish over both the loss of the only woman he wanted and the death of
[02:22:20] his brother crazy horse grabbed the nearest horse and gave chase across broken land he kept up the
[02:22:26] chase until no water plunged his horse into the elk river and escaped on the other side
[02:22:32] not many days after that the council of old old men met influenced by the relatives of red cloud
[02:22:38] and no water crazy horse was to return the shirt they decided his actions over the woman
[02:22:46] endangered the peace of the ogala and no one outside like no one like no outside enemy could
[02:22:56] and this could not be overlooked though there was anger in his own lodge and from the young men
[02:23:02] at this trickery crazy horse gave back the shirt soon after that the lodge of no water moved
[02:23:10] far south to another camp and whispers were made behind the hand that red cloud was to be given the
[02:23:19] shirt this is like you said there's just a trajectory that that gains get to gaining speed you know you
[02:23:31] lose you know you then I'll use your woman now you lose your brother now you learn to lose your
[02:23:40] placement with the shirt as a shirt where and the friction points are you know him and red cloud
[02:23:51] and so what is he doing he's still fighting and who's he fighting on
[02:23:56] I guess unfortunately he's fighting snakes he's fighting other other Indian tribes
[02:24:03] going to this section here they attack but the snakes were too many the two Lakota groups were
[02:24:07] too far apart to regroup and the mud was too deep their horses tired somehow they managed to hold back
[02:24:13] the determined counter attack crazy horse high backbone and good weasel with their rifles
[02:24:18] were rear guard as others retreated first one fell back then another managing to keep the snakes
[02:24:25] at bay but several snakes on fresh horses suddenly were able to surround high backbone
[02:24:32] and crazy horse saw his old friend take a bullet in the chest still the old warrior pulled
[02:24:39] out as pistol and emptied it at the on rushing enemy until they overran him crazy horse ran
[02:24:46] into rescue him but his horse was too tired from pulling himself out of the mud and the enemy fire
[02:24:52] was too much good weasel finally intervened grabbing the rain to his horse the rain turned into snow as
[02:24:58] they rode road toward home sometime in the night they found a sheltered place and built a warming fire
[02:25:04] with with their horses while their horses rested crazy horse sat huddled beneath his robe
[02:25:11] alone with the thoughts of his old friend and teacher
[02:25:14] so I mean it's just it's just a downward spiral at this point
[02:25:26] they get back to camp crazy horse smoked his pipe and pondered all that had happened since
[02:25:30] he and he dog had carried their lances against the crow much had been taken away it seemed first
[02:25:38] black buffalo woman then his place is a shirt wear now his younger brother and his oldest friend were gone
[02:25:47] he took little comfort in knowing they had died on the path they they had chosen
[02:25:52] there was only emptiness where they had been perhaps these things had come to pass because he had
[02:25:58] not fully honored the calling to be a thunder dreamer though he had learned the importance of honoring
[02:26:05] the old ways from his fathers and from his father and uncles and his mothers he was not one for
[02:26:11] ceremonies or standing in front of the people but if he must live the life of sacrifice he would as
[02:26:18] a thunder dreamer he did not belong to himself he belonged to the people it was not what he wanted
[02:26:25] for his life but it was what life wanted from him as going forward a little bit this sort of
[02:26:44] collaboration with the whites continues and it continues to escalate and finally at some point
[02:26:51] crazy horse returned home to resurgent rumors that minors were going into the black hills in
[02:26:57] violation of the rules set down in the horse creek treaty gold was the reason I yes gold the white
[02:27:04] man's god the whites were willing to risk their own lives to get gold gold was the reason for
[02:27:09] their interest in the black hills the heart of everything that was to the Lakota
[02:27:14] so they got the sacred the sacred black hills and the whites want to get gold this is
[02:27:28] this is going breaking away from the story for a second and going into one of the reflections
[02:27:33] sections from from marshal in this point most boys therefore basically learn the same lessons
[02:27:44] and we're given the same opportunities to perform as fighting men so how does a crazy horse emerge
[02:27:49] from a broad cultural blueprint and set himself apart perhaps he is testimony to the premise
[02:27:56] that some things cannot be taught perhaps there is something innate that some have and others don't
[02:28:02] men and women who coach young athletes point out that while skill and methodology can be taught to
[02:28:08] any athlete the physical attributes of speed and quickness are frequently the difference between a
[02:28:13] good athlete and an outstanding one many people dream of becoming leaders while others
[02:28:19] shun the opportunity even when it falls into their laps general George Pat and a World War II
[02:28:23] fame certainly sought the responsibilities of leadership and reveled in its rewards and prestige
[02:28:30] when he was successful crazy horse on the other hand was not as quick to grab the opportunity when it
[02:28:36] came and literally had no desire to talk about his exploits but both were exceptional leaders
[02:28:42] and their accomplishments could not have been achieved without a certain amount of basic ability
[02:28:47] as well as the experience of winning and losing what is less obvious is that both of them also
[02:28:52] had inherent characteristics only a few of us have those characteristics enabled them to perform
[02:28:59] daring and reckless deeds and make bold decisions and to inspire others to follow them
[02:29:05] what those characteristics are by name or label is often difficult to identify but the consequences
[02:29:11] they enable are not difficult to see. guys had some attributes you know and that question comes
[02:29:21] up a lot for our leaders born or made and I always my answer which I wrote about leadership strategy
[02:29:27] tactics is you're gonna have some strengths and weaknesses all of us are are you gonna be lucky
[02:29:33] enough to have you know the full of the full catalog of great leadership assets chances are
[02:29:41] about zero. could you be a George Patton that you know has your articulate and your smart
[02:29:48] and your calm and you you have control of your most you can read people like all those things
[02:29:53] I guess but it's gonna be very rare we're gonna have strength and weaknesses and
[02:29:58] and occasionally some people are gonna get that level of charisma and an influence over other people
[02:30:07] um that's gonna come from a place maybe not maybe you can't teach that there's parts of
[02:30:16] leadership that you can absolutely teach there's parts of even you know the way you care yourself
[02:30:21] that you can improve but what we what we always teach people is you got to build a team of leaders
[02:30:30] that help you with the your areas of weakness so if there's something you're not maybe not that great
[02:30:35] at find someone on your team that is boy and if you want to find step on to success hey start
[02:30:45] treating everybody with respect and and and like they said with their leaders their their
[02:30:52] their deal is your job is to teach is to take care of the people and then people will do
[02:30:59] almost anything for you um yeah I'm gonna do it. Just one of the lessons that you just you could
[02:31:09] take away from this and and see that like crazy horses doing all these things but he's not really
[02:31:17] bragging about it but everybody sees it and everyone else is talking about it which makes it seem even
[02:31:22] greater yeah and then you know when he comes back from a raid the first thing he does he's like
[02:31:28] I got all these horses let me go give them to the widows and let me divide up all this stuff and
[02:31:32] give it and take care of take care of which is a job. Yeah put others before yourself step one.
[02:31:45] Go back the book black buffalo woman Red Cloud's niece was the love of his life politics
[02:31:49] however influenced her choice for a husband she married no water only because he was of an influential
[02:31:55] family and their union enabled a broader influence in a stronger political base crazy horse was of
[02:32:00] course heartbroken in time the wound would heal but as it's often the case a true love has never
[02:32:06] completely forgotten a few years later when the opportunity arose black buffalo woman followed
[02:32:11] her heart and left her husband the coat of women can make a choice because societal norms allowed it
[02:32:17] but in her case a jealous husband did not and this did to him just kind of debriefing this crazy horse
[02:32:23] to put himself in harm's way many times as a fighting man but he probably never came as close to
[02:32:27] dying as he did when no water showed up with the borrowed pistol and shot him in the face
[02:32:31] it was no water's intention to kill crazy horse and he thought he did the subsequent fewer
[02:32:36] brought several factions on the brink of blood shed on one side someone to defend no water and
[02:32:42] on the other someone to revenge crazy horse to prevent any violence crazy horse gave up the love of
[02:32:47] his life for a second time those who were jealous of him were quick to influence the old men
[02:32:55] leaders to strip them of the position of shirt wearer crazy horse willingly gave up the shirt
[02:33:01] but the status he had achieved circumvented the loss of influence many people though not totally
[02:33:06] overlooking his mistakes till regard him as a strong leader and remain loyal to him it was a
[02:33:11] lesson not lost on him never again did he put his own desires above the needs of the people that
[02:33:18] was yet another example for others to follow true leadership is rarely the consequence of election
[02:33:24] appointment dictatorship or inheritance good leadership overall is much too critical to be left to
[02:33:31] elected politicians monarchs managers administrators supervisors and directors having a
[02:33:38] authority does not make anyone a leader true leadership is exercised when someone performs a
[02:33:43] necessary or critical task and accomplishes an objective thereby setting an example
[02:33:49] most of us will never face the daunting task of leading men and women in the combat
[02:33:53] but we will likely have an opportunity to set an example we may not carry titles such as
[02:33:58] president governor mayor general or even chief but we can be leaders simply by demonstrating
[02:34:04] that effort can be made tasks can be accomplished
[02:34:16] yeah you know it's interesting you look at a seal puttor and there's gonna be between one and five
[02:34:23] leaders in there hopefully there might be zero but that's chances are very small of that
[02:34:29] there's gonna be one to five and they might be anyone of the puttor and you can just see
[02:34:34] and if they're well balanced you know like there's some young guy or you know one cruise wonder
[02:34:39] that's just has good natural leadership ability smart has he going check and he can make things
[02:34:45] happen and it doesn't matter that he's not the chief it doesn't matter he's not the lieutenant
[02:34:50] and as long as the chief and lieutenant humble enough guy hey he's a good leader hey you want to run
[02:34:54] this thing it's gonna be fine occasionally those guys get mad they get scared they get intimidated
[02:34:59] they don't want someone running things they think they should be and yeah I've seen it where
[02:35:08] you get like a new guy in a puttor and any isn't necessarily calling any shots but because his
[02:35:15] demeanor he's like got a good demeanor he's never bummed out it's like yeah everything's really
[02:35:20] terrible and it's like yeah this whatever and you'll watch that like his his influence because
[02:35:27] he's got a good attitude even in a worse situation will bleed over to the rest of the puttor
[02:35:30] and so guys are kicking rocks and saying this where you this is done that that that that that
[02:35:37] great attitude is is contagious so that leadership kind of by example even when they're not really
[02:35:44] influenced people what to do they're influencing the overall effectiveness of the unit by
[02:35:48] bringing it's morale of the race the morale that's freaking priceless priceless the hits just keep on
[02:35:58] coming um crazy horse who who at now as a different wife he he he he has a daughter with she dies
[02:36:09] death was not new to him men died and battle sometimes and he was not surprised by that they were gone
[02:36:14] or at that or the way that they had died as fighting men but the bundle atop is scaffold was
[02:36:20] harder reality it was a reality that challenged the goodness in life he fell across it and wept
[02:36:27] uncontrollably days passed there was thunder some wind and a little rain when he could no longer stay
[02:36:32] awake he slept beneath the scaffold curled up on her robe he ignored hunger and thirst warm
[02:36:40] had told him a kind of coughing sickness unknown before the whites came had taken her though he had
[02:36:46] tried he could find no medicine to help her finally when no more tears would come crazy horse took his
[02:36:52] leave the news that awaited him fanned his anger even more soldiers had gone into the black hills
[02:37:00] a large contingent according to the sketchy reports from the few from a few Lakota who had
[02:37:07] the misfortune of being in the wrong place the wrong time a group friendly to the whites
[02:37:11] had been watching the column of wagons and the soldiers when they when they were attacked one
[02:37:17] Lakota was killed another wounded they somehow managed to escape to tell their story so now you're
[02:37:23] you know you're blaming the death of your daughter on the whites as well and now they're going into
[02:37:30] your holy land yeah so now they go out and start just basically killing whites where they can
[02:37:43] find them the most vulnerable at this time is the minors people that are out in these little mining
[02:37:48] camps and so they start initiating more of a more of a guerrilla warfare and this is something that
[02:37:54] you know knowing what we know now about insurgency's that would have been the call because they
[02:38:01] couldn't get people to unite but that fighting like an insurgent war would have been the well
[02:38:08] would have been another possibility and that's what he kind of end up doing here he says the
[02:38:12] tactics crazy horse and his companions were simple yet effective after observing isolated minors
[02:38:17] camps to determine their numbers and weapons they position themselves and swept in if the terrain
[02:38:22] was rough was rough and offered good cover they sneaked in close on foot before they attacked
[02:38:27] in open areas with little cover they charged in on horses that's kind of crazy because that's exactly
[02:38:33] what we would do like if we had if we could sneak into a target on foot we do that if we couldn't
[02:38:39] we just tried the vehicles right up to the target and that's what the exact same thing they would do
[02:38:44] massive explosive breach lots of nowhere common in in either situation they use their
[02:38:49] lances and war clubs and the silent bow quite effectively rarely did any minor react quickly enough
[02:38:55] to fire a gun which worked in the Lakota's favor without gunshots to warn anyone else in the
[02:39:00] area the minors in the next valley or watershed remained oblivious and thus vulnerable to attack
[02:39:08] he says this it was necessary to attack the minors and kill them they were trespassers and thieves
[02:39:13] not honorable enemies the tactics they used were the only way to fight them especially in the
[02:39:18] black hills strike hard and fast and flicked and inflict as much chaos and as many casualties
[02:39:23] as possible and then withdraw swiftly that kind of fighting could play to the Lakota's strengths
[02:39:29] and skills as fighters good at close combat crazy horse spoke these thoughts to his companions
[02:39:34] as they rode home and they listened and agreed they'd seen firsthand what could be done if enough
[02:39:40] Lakota fighting men could be persuaded to fight in the same way and if enough bullets and powder
[02:39:46] could be obtained the whites could be driven away yeah I mean that's the only strategy they got
[02:39:55] because they the minors have got all these things they need they got guns and they got bullets
[02:39:59] they're not getting those from anybody else and so they just sneak in pick them up sneak in pick them
[02:40:07] meanwhile red cloud it was learned who's making the trip to persuade the powers and
[02:40:11] Washington to remove the little agent from his agency when all is said and done it didn't matter
[02:40:17] who the agent was on spotted tail agency or on the red cloud agency as long as there was an
[02:40:21] agent and the Lakota accepted it and newbies the whites were in control but when red cloud and the
[02:40:27] others returned and there were many supposed headmen who made the trip the news they brought back
[02:40:34] in sensed the wild Lakota and you made this distinction I haven't pulled it out yet but there's
[02:40:38] basically the the ones that are living in the agencies and then there's the Lakota that are wild
[02:40:43] that are still living in the traditional way to the best of their ability and I say the best
[02:40:48] of the ability because they relied heavily on buffalo and the buffalo were being wiped out and so
[02:40:57] this makes living in their traditional way much more difficult in some cases probably impossible
[02:41:05] the great father wanted to buy the black hills sell the heart of everything that is sell the
[02:41:14] dust of the ancestors not looking not there's there's Lakota that we're just we're not doing it
[02:41:26] the day now there's more politics takes place and eventually they're supposed to all come and
[02:41:31] report the day when all Lakota had to report to the agencies it coming gone the northern camps were nervous
[02:41:37] watching the horizons for the first sign of soldiers that they had heard had been gathering at
[02:41:42] Fort Fetterman when it relaxed its grip and a span of warm days it melted the snow and
[02:41:47] followed the ice on the creeks and rivers he dog took advantage of the opportunity to head for the agency
[02:41:53] his contingent of eight Lakota families were mostly women and children in no condition
[02:41:57] outrun mounted soldiers before he left crazy horse had ridden up into the hills unable to watch
[02:42:03] his closest friend give into the agency though he understood all too painfully he dogs reasons
[02:42:10] the spaces vacated by eight lodges were not as big as the holes left in the hearts of the
[02:42:16] relatives who watched their loved ones riding away slowly and uncertainly looking back frequently
[02:42:22] I mean you know the guys got a bunch of women and kids and the he knows he's gonna do so much and
[02:42:36] sitting bull sent out his carefully chosen messages to announce that the people should gather near
[02:42:41] chalk butts in late spring and treating them to speak wisely and clearly to the leaders among
[02:42:46] the Lakota as well as the Dakota and Nakota he wanted his messages to appeal to their sense of
[02:42:52] pride especially to those who are surely disenchanted with life on the agencies so sitting bulls
[02:42:57] another wild one of the Indians and he's very I mean obviously we've all heard of sitting bull
[02:43:05] and so he has incredible amount of influence and he's starting to try and gather people up and
[02:43:09] unite them a little bit so that starts to take place more and more people arrived almost every
[02:43:18] day the horse herb was growing and eating down the sparse grass around the butts some of the men
[02:43:23] said perhaps there was many as 7,000 head sitting bulls already at work inviting the older leaders
[02:43:28] to his lodge he was an impressive and charismatic man a slight limp from a gunshot wound to his
[02:43:34] hip during his days a young fighting man served only to give him more credibility he had earned nearly
[02:43:39] 70 battle honors more than any man at the gathering except crazy horse now past the age of 50 he had
[02:43:47] a solid reputation as a wise leader and counselor enhanced by his status as a medicine man he was
[02:43:53] immensely pleased at the response to his message and announced he would conduct a Sundance
[02:43:59] spiritually as well as psychologically it was the right thing at the right time it could only
[02:44:06] serve to unify the people and add to the feelings of strength and pride that seemed to be growing
[02:44:11] as quickly as the horse herd it was that kind of insight that made him an influential leader
[02:44:15] the camp movement moved west across the powder and the tongue into the valley of the rose bud
[02:44:23] and across it as well turning at the northern slopes of the wolf mountains into the broken
[02:44:28] country near the greasy grass river while sitting bull was hard at work for the hearts and minds
[02:44:37] the people crazy horse scouts and all directions feeling among the military leaders was that the
[02:44:44] biggest threat laid to lay to the south from three stars army and this book does not have a
[02:44:58] ton of detail about the battle at rose bud or really the battle at little big horn
[02:45:05] those are detailed pretty well in the book I fought with custard and also in the book wooden leg
[02:45:10] um but there is sort of a debriefing here on some of the things that went that went down
[02:45:17] going to the book the rose bug bud fight as the battle came to be known was the toughest combat
[02:45:22] crazy horse had seen the battle of hundred and hand ten years earlier that was when they
[02:45:28] surrounded those soldiers and killed the bird the battle of the hundred in the hand ten years earlier
[02:45:35] had had its own set of circumstances that made it tough but at the rose bud
[02:45:39] Lakota the Lakota faced a larger and more heavily armed enemy force three stars soldiers were both
[02:45:46] infantry and cavalry forcing Lakota to adjust to different tactics as the fighting progressed attack
[02:45:53] was met with counter attack as the day war on the valley of the rose bud funded with gunfire and dust
[02:45:59] hung in the air laid in the afternoon who is evident that the soldiers were disorganized fighting
[02:46:03] and scattered units their effectiveness significantly reduced crazy horse was notified even though
[02:46:10] nearly a hundred had arrived at mid-morning the Lakota and sahila were critically low on ammunition
[02:46:18] sensing that three stars wouldn't be able to mount any pursuit crazy horse sent the word to withdraw
[02:46:24] crazy horse rode with he dog big road and good weasel among others as they once again
[02:46:31] chased dusk into night there was no pursuit from the soldiers to speak of the feverish after
[02:46:37] math of combat slowly faded as the reality of the day began to take hold ten good men in
[02:46:42] been killed and many wounded in a day or two the the scouts crazy horse had left behind would report
[02:46:48] on the soldiers so that's the first big battle that they engage is that battle at rose bud
[02:46:56] and then six days had passed since the rose bud fight victory dance is still went
[02:47:01] far into the night and the fighting men were asked to tell the stories of their involvement
[02:47:06] the mood of the encampment had changed from initial uncertainty to one of comfortable
[02:47:11] sense of strength hardly anyone no matter how old could remember the Lakota ever see gathering
[02:47:17] in such numbers for any purpose at midday sitting bull sent cryers to announce the move
[02:47:24] to the greasy grass valley and by mid afternoon the first lodges were taken down and the
[02:47:31] families began moving by sundown most of the encampment was gone except for a few lodges
[02:47:37] and the sun dance arbor fast forward up a little bit more there in their kind of camp now
[02:47:49] and we'll go to the book the sides of the council lodging and rolled up to allow cross
[02:47:53] ventilation a few men were waiting in anticipation meeting with sitting bull women had already
[02:47:58] brought food sitting bull had been busy through most of the night attending to a gravely ill woman
[02:48:03] he arrived at the council lodged just as a slight den of commotion came from the south end of the
[02:48:09] encampment where he had just been a lone Lakota rider splashed across the greasy grass
[02:48:16] filled bank to bank with the heavy spring runoff from the mountain snows gaining the west bank
[02:48:22] he began to shout prepare yourselves the soldiers are coming the soldiers are coming
[02:48:31] and this is when we get into the little big horn battle
[02:48:37] the soldiers across the river far to the south near the mouth vash creek can try to gallop
[02:48:43] tried galloping their horses across the long open flood plain toward the south end of the encampment
[02:48:48] they had been quickly driven back and then chased across the river many were killed at the water
[02:48:53] crossing after heavy fighting in some trees near the river as far as crazy horse and the other
[02:48:59] leaders were concerned that was the first fight gall of the hunk papa and ol and ogala battle
[02:49:07] leaders black moon and big road were among those who had courageously led 200 fighting men in that action
[02:49:12] the second fight started at medicine tail kooley more soldiers had tried to cross into the
[02:49:21] encampment from the north end but were stopped by a small determined group of boys and old men
[02:49:26] armed mostly with old single shot rifles by then many of the women children old people were
[02:49:32] fleeing to the northwest somehow worded reached crazy horse and gall of the second attempted
[02:49:39] incursion gall immediately disengaged from the first fight and let a hundred men to medicine tail
[02:49:44] and crossed the soldiers galloped away up a long slope to the north crazy horse at hurried to
[02:49:51] to his lodge and found black shawl that's his wife waiting with his second war horse
[02:49:56] the camp was in total confusion not only were women and children running away to safety
[02:50:00] men were galloping through to hurried to the second fight shouts and screams filled the air
[02:50:05] gunshots could be heard to the south and now thinly to the north he took a second war horse
[02:50:12] and gall there is many men as to him as he could if a second group of soldiers was heading
[02:50:18] north they could be circling to attack from another direction it made sense to try and flank
[02:50:22] them so he led the men who were with him to an old crossing guessing the soldiers would stay on
[02:50:27] the high ground he had crossed the river and raised to meet them if they came off the end of the
[02:50:31] high north south ridge where he knew they laid to the east on the slopes across the river they
[02:50:37] circled to the east and encountered 20 or so soldiers whom they chased back to the main body
[02:50:44] the gunfire never stopped he heard it as they crossed the river a continuous sound rather like
[02:50:50] someone tearing canvas gall and his men crazy horse heard later stayed in pursuit of the running
[02:50:57] soldiers even though they did not gain a ridge at first the soldiers were organized even managing
[02:51:03] to dismount and form skirmish lines to fire at the oncoming Lakota but galls relentless pursuit
[02:51:08] broke their lines and after that they were running away and their fire was no longer effective
[02:51:15] crazy horse led a charge when the soldiers tried to push north off their ridge by then gunfire
[02:51:21] was thinning it was sporadic and then there were silence the second fight was over as he rode
[02:51:27] through the dust and he could see how it had unfolded dead horses and dead soldiers were
[02:51:34] strewn along the path they had taken what's what's different about a little big horn battle
[02:51:43] field then then get his bird is because the scale of it's much smaller they actually they have
[02:51:49] markers for where these soldiers were dying and they went back and they could find all the
[02:51:52] scourge lines and everything so you can see it in real you know laid out where bodies fell
[02:52:01] became up from the river then across and then just the disaster that happened I mean you
[02:52:05] couldn't all the the way it's laid out and the bodies are laid out you can see that the guys are
[02:52:08] just try the last couple guys were just trying to get away and getting mold mean while the guys
[02:52:14] down at the other position they're surrounded up on that hill they're waiting for their turn
[02:52:20] they're wondering where cus custer splits forces all these times and there and they're wondering
[02:52:26] where did he go did he leave us and some guys kind of push out and they can see
[02:52:32] this big swirling thing and they can see the Lakota shooting down the ground they're like oh no
[02:52:38] he's done and then they wind up getting their under siege yeah looking forward to walking that
[02:52:49] battlefield myself going back to the story here after that the you know sitting bulls trying to keep
[02:52:59] people there but they they kind of start to like it's the fighting's over and kind of people
[02:53:09] got stuff to do right well there's another element coming toward him too and they're like hey we
[02:53:12] got to move everybody yeah yeah and I'm even going past that so that happens um and eventually
[02:53:20] he says this what was left of the largest gathering ever of Lakota separated in several encampments
[02:53:25] moving along the eastern foothills of the shining mountain soon after the departure from Greece
[02:53:29] he grasped small groups began breaking away to head for the agencies sitting bull like crazy horse
[02:53:34] was deeply disappointed because they were losing the strength of numbers despite the best efforts
[02:53:40] of sitting bull the people scattered some made excuses saying it was time to hunt and make meat for
[02:53:44] the coming winter which was more difficult now because of the scarcity of buffalo others on a
[02:53:49] bashly headed for the agencies sitting bull finally headed north to more familiar territory crazy
[02:53:55] horse took his people east to the black hills finding a sheltered valley northwest of the mountains
[02:53:59] to hide the camps from there he led raids into the black hills there that continues for a while
[02:54:14] and this is all he does a great job in the book of just this kind of torment and anguish that
[02:54:21] that crazy horse is going through as as he sees what's happening at some point dull knife
[02:54:29] another one of his friends informed crazy horse that he was forced to consider living giving in
[02:54:35] to life on the agency if it meant his people would be safe from facing continual conflict with the
[02:54:40] long knives the idea was debated long and frequently strangely an opportunity presented itself
[02:54:47] when messengers arrived bringing word to from three stars who had been given assurance that the
[02:54:53] wild Lakota would be allowed to select the location for their own agencies if they signed a piece
[02:54:59] agreement the only drawback was that included an agreement to sell to the sale of the black hills
[02:55:07] and spite of deep seated suspicions crazy horse agreed that this important issue should be
[02:55:12] discussed face to face with the long knives crazy horse and a law large detachment of warriors
[02:55:20] escorted the delegation north to the fort on the elk river a group of crow scouts met the
[02:55:28] emissaries just outside the walls of the fort making friendly gestures to indicate their peacefulness
[02:55:34] as the eight Lakota road past them toward the gate weapons were drawn suddenly and the crow open
[02:55:40] fire at point blank range on the unarmed Lakota and then fled on horseback crazy horse charged
[02:55:45] down from the bluff but stopped when mounted soldiers emerge emerge from the fort instinctively
[02:55:50] the Lakota emissaries turn their horses and gallop for the safety of the bluffs and protection
[02:55:55] of the escort warriors only three rejoined the warriors five laid dead on the ground near the gates in
[02:56:01] the fort so the chance for peace in the crow just gets gets like completely fumble fumble and um
[02:56:16] yeah you know the crow had motivations to do with the dead and you know the
[02:56:25] I think the guy's come out of the thing they're trying to hunt him down because they realize
[02:56:29] oh dang it yep this is um the fast forward a little bit more the harsh winner should have been
[02:56:41] to turn at least providing a brief respite from worrying about the long knives but that was not
[02:56:46] to be to agency Lakota carrying a bold message from bear coat found the crazy horse camp
[02:56:53] if the wild Lakota moved into the agencies they would be given food but would have to give up
[02:56:58] their weapons and horses sword graciously has ever assured crazy horses people that it was his
[02:57:08] idea to intervene because he didn't want his friends and relatives dying when peace in a good
[02:57:13] life could be had so easily if crazy horse would come in meaning surrender his people would be given
[02:57:21] food clothing and blankets and then he would be allowed to return to powder river area to claim
[02:57:26] it as his agency so like oh you want we'll give you peace we'll give you food you can have your own
[02:57:32] area only he and sitting bowl were stubborn or perhaps foolish how could anyone continue
[02:57:41] resisting when even a brief battle used up the bullets that took several days of scrounging
[02:57:47] half the people who followed him wanted to go into the agency they were tired of running from the
[02:57:52] soldiers tired of being hungry tired of seeing relatives die they stayed because they believed he
[02:57:58] had an answer of some kind something that would solve the problem of the soldiers
[02:58:04] yeah you can it's just closing in and there's really not much of an option yeah these essentially
[02:58:25] your glaciers glacier yeah forces just just towards him and he's gonna get crushed and squeeze in one direction
[02:58:35] so they end up going to camp Robinson fast forward a little bit here nearly four months at
[02:58:48] past since crazy horse people had arrived at camp Robinson 900 and all with over 1500 horses the soldiers
[02:58:55] had taken their horses first and then their guns and then their hope and four months the promise
[02:59:01] of an agency of their own in the north that turned into an impossible dream he blamed himself
[02:59:06] partly because he could do nothing perhaps if he had learned to be an agency Lakota and put on
[02:59:14] the defeated smile and the presence of three stars and other soldier leaders none of this would
[02:59:20] be happening but the soldiers were not the only ones to cause the turmoil of the past four months
[02:59:26] the finger of blame could be pointed at many Lakota as well in fact they were mostly to blame
[02:59:33] the white agents and the army officers found the flames of jealousy and let little minds that could
[02:59:39] not think beyond the moment and little men who yearned for recognition and power do the rest there was
[02:59:47] no other way to look at it in the end the Lakota defeated themselves they had the whites outnumbered
[02:59:56] an outman and did nothing the entire garrison could have been overrun by the by enough determined
[03:00:02] Lakota fighting men with a good plan if they truly wanted to return to living the old way
[03:00:07] and control of their lands and their lives instead men stepped over each other to betray their own
[03:00:16] relatives in order to obtain the power handed out by the whites a power they couldn't get on their own
[03:00:26] and he details some of this just ego drama that's going on and they have the opportunity you know
[03:00:32] if I'm if I'm in camp and you know Jason crazy horse Jason's out there still being a wild
[03:00:38] Lakota and I want more power in the camp maybe I say you know you don't want to you don't want to
[03:00:43] deal with that Jason crazy or he's too crazy out there you don't want to put him in a power position
[03:00:48] you don't want to get like all these things this happens a buffalo hunt had been promised
[03:00:53] but there'd been no hunt and crazy horse understood why first someone with more power than three
[03:00:58] stars had to say that the Lakota could go chasing buffalo if given the opportunity three stars
[03:01:03] reason the hunters would keep going perhaps all the way to grand mother's land to join sitting
[03:01:09] both which is Canada by the way adding to that some among the Lakota complain to three stars that
[03:01:16] if crazy horse and his young man were allowed to hump buffalo then everyone must be allowed
[03:01:22] and it was a Lakota who warned that it was dangerous to put guns in the hands of crazy horse
[03:01:28] so he's just getting stabbed in the back by you know as is dream pointed out by some of his own people
[03:01:40] after many of the soldier leaders at camp Robinson came to crazy horse with horse with questions
[03:01:45] about the greasy grass fight and the defeat of the long hair which is cluster two agency chief
[03:01:52] sent messages complaining to three star perhaps there was no place for another agency chief
[03:01:58] crazy horse thought to reassure his uncle red cloud that he had no wish to be made a chief of any kind
[03:02:04] but he knew anything he had to say to them would not be regarded as truth but eventually the
[03:02:09] rumors did fly it was said three star would make crazy horse chief over everyone including
[03:02:15] spotted tail and red clouds you can see this is just like political drama to make mark matters
[03:02:20] worse many of the lesser soldier leaders with himself saying that crazy horse could influence the
[03:02:24] younger men better than the two older leaders could through it all he had tried to talk to three
[03:02:29] stars about the promise of a northern agency day after day traveling to Robinson from cottonwood
[03:02:35] creek if you want your agency some of crazy horse's friend said carefully in low voices
[03:02:42] for it was hard to know who might be listening you will have to travel to their place at
[03:02:47] power where the great father lives and speak to him face to face of course they warned
[03:02:52] if three star sends you ahead of red cloud or spotted tail they will find a way to make it
[03:02:58] difficult for us while you're gone they will find a way to take you down when you return
[03:03:05] crazy horse had no wish to travel to the great father and curry favor from a man he didn't know
[03:03:11] you'd be out of place and only something for show someone to perform for the powerful crazy
[03:03:17] horse did not wish to be a thing of curiosity fast forward a little bit more and now he's
[03:03:29] trying to make a deal man he's trying to like get it done he knows what what where these things are
[03:03:35] going he's late in the game but he's trying to make it happen yeah I mean he's got it he's got to
[03:03:46] think about the women in the children at this point and he's like well you know I could keep fighting
[03:03:51] but then who's going to protect them and that's where this is where the guys is so honorable
[03:03:57] because he just he knows where his responsibility is it's not like how many soldiers I can kill
[03:04:02] because he can kill quite a few more and he can probably you know inspire a bunch of the young
[03:04:09] men on the thing to to to rise up but to what end and at the end of the the day it's the women and
[03:04:16] children they're going to suffer so then he's like I gotta try and fix this and negotiate the best
[03:04:21] deal that he can at that point so he starts to put to deal together
[03:04:29] lieutenant Lee the soldier leader in charge at spotted tails agency sent word that crazy horse must
[03:04:35] come to the soldier house crazy horse rode out with touch the clouds and white thunder spotted
[03:04:41] tail and over a hundred of his young men met them on the trail Lee arrived with black crow and
[03:04:47] Louis Bordeaux and was frightened seeing that he was between the minicondue and the aglala
[03:04:55] on one side and spotted tails on the other there were shouts and threats hurled back and forth
[03:05:01] and weapons brandished until crazy horse raised a hand in silence slowly fell over the
[03:05:05] gathering Lee now very frightened told crazy horse that he must return to Robinson and make it
[03:05:11] good with the soldier leaders there so the night past the morning came when the sun arose he
[03:05:19] hurried to the soldier house to speak to lieutenant Lee to assure him that he had not changed his mind
[03:05:25] there's ready to speak with Randall he was one of the leaders to make things good so with touch the
[03:05:30] clouds swift bear and black crow along they started out for camp Robinson the first group of blue
[03:05:37] coded Lakota men met them along the trail they said nothing informed a wide half circle around crazy
[03:05:45] horse and the others further on more blue coded Lakota arrived and now they became a mob of more than
[03:05:52] 60 it was then that crazy horse knew he was in trouble so now you have Lakota's that are wearing the the
[03:06:00] military the American military jacket fast thunder was lost in the crowd so tour he
[03:06:10] dog and touch the clouds all around was noise of running and scuffling as if men were pushing
[03:06:17] together crazy horse was pushed toward a square house made of logs a strange place for Randall the
[03:06:22] Bee before he could help himself he was through the open doorway there was a bad smell a man with
[03:06:27] dark hair and braids rose from the corner then he saw the iron bars he spun on a heel and saw
[03:06:36] man little big man blocking the opening crazy horse shoved the shorter man aside and tried to push
[03:06:42] past but almost immediately felt little big man grab both of his arms from behind with a great effort
[03:06:49] he pulled himself free and reached into the opening of his blanket for the knife outside there were
[03:06:56] shouts of both soldiers and the Lakota let me go he said a little big man let me go the man
[03:07:06] the oglala warrior who had written in a battle with him stood fast perhaps it was the blue coat of
[03:07:12] the soldier that had turned his heart with a sudden swipe crazy horse slashed the arm of the coat
[03:07:18] and immediately blood flowed and little big man jump back with a step crazy horse was outside and
[03:07:26] there was movement everywhere more hands grabbed at him from either side brown hands holding
[03:07:30] him fast the strident voice of a soldier yelled from the middle of the confusion came a soldier
[03:07:36] frusting with the knife at the end of his rifle those near him heard crazy horse gasp and saw
[03:07:45] his knees begin to wobble brown hands still holding his arms even as the soldier with
[03:07:52] drew the long knife let me go they heard him say quietly you've gotten me hurt then he fell
[03:08:06] and crazy horse died a few hours later it details that in the book and
[03:08:25] feel and his dream the dream that he had became fulfilled and again it it makes me think about
[03:08:41] that that quote that native American quote from that podcast with with Mike afanke that the
[03:08:48] diagnosis is a curse and this seems to be something similar when you know that thing when we're driving
[03:08:57] go through that driving course and they warn you when you're going through like a tactical driving
[03:09:01] course and you're driving around the track or you're driving in an out of traffic you're doing
[03:09:05] these things and they warn you they give you a warning they say when you're driving if you look at
[03:09:09] something you need what you need to look at is the opening you need to look at the part of the
[03:09:15] track that you can drive you need to look at the part of this this road that you can go through that you
[03:09:19] can make it through because if you look at another car or you look at a guardrail or you look at a
[03:09:24] ditch that's where you're going that's where you're going to end up we go where we aim
[03:09:35] and I don't know this is a self fulfilling prophecy here but it might be and I think it's
[03:09:45] a good idea to try and set your sights on a positive outcome another thought I had about this is
[03:09:57] you know BH Ladell Hart who go listen to some podcasts that I've done on BH Ladell Hart
[03:10:04] the indirect approach but he also talked about the fact that
[03:10:09] what happens to profits you know profits and you have leaders what happens to profits profits
[03:10:16] die when you go out you profit you you make statements and you don't compromise you die
[03:10:27] and your your message will get traction later on and and it's using the leaders that take the
[03:10:35] message from the profit and turn it into something that can be brought to fruition you know they
[03:10:43] they use compromise they use understanding and the usual relationships to to move an idea forward
[03:10:49] in a more practical way but the profits the believers that don't compromise oftentimes
[03:10:58] they're crucified they're killed and pretty clear where crazy horse fell in that
[03:11:10] category which category he fell into powerful lessons to be learned if you want to join us
[03:11:21] on the battlefield little big horn we're going to be up there in August
[03:11:25] August 16th and 17th and then August 18th and 19th we're doing it back to back
[03:11:31] we'll go out there you'll learn we'll learn we'll explore with so many characters
[03:11:37] cluster is a leadership lesson after leadership lesson about what not to do
[03:11:46] so much so much incredible stuff so we want to join us up there we'll see you go to
[03:11:53] echelonfront.com check out events and you can find it we're also going to get his bird

[03:12:05] May 11th and 12th and then again on May 13th and 14th and then there's a dinner before both
[03:12:10] those the night before so if you want to come those check them out if and look go anyways you don't have to
[03:12:17] go with us go and learn this this as Americans all this is part of our shared history all these lessons
[03:12:32] had both these battlefields there's so much for us to learn from and we can learn from you know
[03:12:38] in the case of a lot of the things that we heard this soldiers were doing were not
[03:12:42] good to look like hey this is what I'm not going to do this is not an honorable way to behave
[03:12:46] and then we can see within the Lakota are talking about generosity being the a virtue of a warrior
[03:12:56] and then considering that and saying that is a virtue that I want to a strive to as an American
[03:13:05] yeah and that this is such a great way to learn these lessons
[03:13:09] it is thanks for listening if you want to support yourself or you're supporting us you go to
[03:13:19] jockelfield.com get some get some medicine get some medicine
[03:13:27] I don't know in the context that we've got right get some medicine get some milk
[03:13:32] good medicine for you yes it is um get some stuff for you joints get some stuff for your immunity
[03:13:42] get some stuff for your energy levels we've got an energy drink that is not a typical energy
[03:13:53] drink it's good for you yep so and it does seem kind of like a rough transitional little
[03:14:00] it's a lot of the way to do it like a lot of these these like native American stories or
[03:14:06] whatever reason I don't know we were talking earlier where I kind of get a little bit more into
[03:14:13] I don't know why maybe because a lot of times it starts with in just right at the beginning
[03:14:18] how they start with how they're raised like how the kids are raised and then you know I have
[03:14:22] young kids on my man I want my kids to be like crazy worse or what was this name before crazy worse
[03:14:27] right here yeah so just from the beginning you're into it you know and then you kind of you
[03:14:35] kind of cheering for me and rooting for him then at the end it's all tragic and then now I got to tell
[03:14:39] everybody how jockel just when goes so healthy for you it is hard to do but it is hard transition
[03:14:45] well we if you want to support that's a good way to do it origin origin us a.com or making a bunch
[03:14:52] of stuff in America jockel store.com we got some t-shirts for you some others some other stuff
[03:15:01] we got jockel underground.com in case we get shut down for whatever reason you can go there and help us out
[03:15:06] we got a YouTube channel so that's cool bunch of books the Ashland front or our leadership consultant
[03:15:13] you can check that we got an online training platform which is which is awesome these these
[03:15:19] leadership lessons that we're talking about they're not they're skills that you can learn look is
[03:15:23] there's some charismatic thing that crazy horse had that maybe we can't give you yes but there's an
[03:15:31] unbelievable number of ways that you can improve your leadership and that's what we what we teach in
[03:15:37] the academy you know at the academy when we do our live sessions right every single one of them now
[03:15:42] someone gives a sit right yeah we're like hey I've been I've been practicing this stuff I'm
[03:15:46] checking my ego I've been working with the other teams on our group and and here's all these massive
[03:15:50] successes and they just compile every week so you can hear from other leaders that are putting
[03:15:58] effort into leadership instead of just not really paying attention to it and then you can quantify
[03:16:04] their successes yeah so cool also to you mentioned like leaders say other leaders whatever
[03:16:09] think a lot of times we talk about this from time to time we're some people some a lot of people I think
[03:16:14] don't hear the word leader and then it's like that's me which kind of they were taught where
[03:16:18] you they're straight up talking about that where it's like hey you don't got to be the general you
[03:16:23] don't got to be the manager you don't even know everyone's kind of like a leader for different
[03:16:28] reasons than the title you know great man and so when you kind of in you know hang around this group
[03:16:35] a lot you know I'm not leading though I'm not I'm not I'm not manager you know nothing like that but
[03:16:40] some of them team yeah but I'm over here uh uh reaping massive you know rewards from you guys
[03:16:51] and it's just me you know from the beginning so I think that's like a the good thing to bring
[03:16:56] up and a good distinction where it's like yeah sure you're talking to quote unquote leaders
[03:17:01] but it's not just the boss you know it's like everybody's on there no there's and there's individuals
[03:17:06] whether there maybe they're running their own business or they're just working somewhere yeah and
[03:17:10] they're they're leading themselves and they're part of the mission yeah and you get we get great
[03:17:16] feedback from them too you know and here's another thing this translates everywhere so
[03:17:23] in the last couple I've been in people have talked about parenting issues
[03:17:29] oh for sure the leadership straight up the life time leadership and they're like hey I had
[03:17:36] you know I had this issue and I've been having this issue with my son and then I realized
[03:17:42] wait a minute it's not my son it's something that I'm doing wrong and I've adjusted the way that I
[03:17:46] interact with them and now things are great you know and they're looking at themselves first and
[03:17:51] taking ownership and if that what you just said hits you if you're listening this right now you just
[03:17:55] heard Jason say that like oh it's something wrong with me as a parent and you all that's bullshit
[03:18:01] I'm that's my kid you better do what I tell if that's what you're out of two days I'm telling
[03:18:05] you got a rude awakening coming your way the it is leadership it's the same you want to
[03:18:10] impose stuff on your children it's not gonna go well for you it's not so be careful that thing you
[03:18:18] just there are said about the the example whatever where it's like oh yeah I use like this lesson
[03:18:25] looked at myself for whatever you know anytime or I looked at it as no it's not them not doing the
