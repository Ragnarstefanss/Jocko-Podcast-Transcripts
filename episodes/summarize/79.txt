Like if you go week two weeks where you just were crazy and work, it was crazy and you know, you know, you know, you know, your health took a little to went down a couple of notches on the priority. I mean, and, how you say, don't be, don't like be hard in yourself, you know, like that kind of like the kind of like I suck. It's just it's kind of the influential element of the culture, you know, where it's like, and you know, my brother, he, he pushed that, you know, not kind of overtly, I guess, but it's more it was like, you guys have to do this. Like, I don't know, it's hard to not draw the analogy, not the analogy, but the comparison between like your boss and subordinates type situation and parenting kids, you know, like for sure. So, and then, but then it, from what I heard, like sometimes when people ask questions, it'll kind of, but this one's kind of ambiguous, but sometimes people ask it, ask a question or make a statement comment, whatever, in terms of take responsibility or take ownership of, like, not of the problems or the solutions, but like before the mission, like, this is my mission. It'll have like, you know, they do like, and you know, development stuff like that. Yeah, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, really, it's a version of going behind someone's back. You didn't, man, man, man, man when you're in the situation, especially with work, you know, where your daughter's like, you know, in the hospital or whatever, and you're like, yeah, So, you know, but you say something like, you know, we both know that nobody benefits when people lose their temper, right? But there's also an extreme, and I don't know if you know this, I don't know how much you know about this, or if you've ever read about it, but there's an extreme side of longevity of trying, if you're goal in life was to live as long as possible, there's an extreme version of that. You know, you know, like, put money on your table, give you feed your kids and take money off their table, you know, and whether they're rich or not, money is money. If you want to see, you know, I guess what we look like, if you don't know, I feel like the guess. Just like are you saying sometimes people don't know necessarily that it's unethical or they don't know what's that unethical or something like that. Yeah, it's like part of the going through, I know this on low level, I guess I understand it's like a little bit. Like, you know, people fast for a specific reason, or even a kind of a general reason, but it's like, fasting alone isn't going to make you achieve whatever it is you're doing. So having those tough conversations like you're talking about having them upfront and whether it's your, rewrite, whether it's counseling somebody, whether it's dealing with, you know, my boss, who I want to tell, like, hey, I think there's a better way to do this. And you know, you're going to slide something tactfully, and they're tactfully, because again, you're still dealing with like, you know, Proposable flare-ups, and there he goes after me. I mean, just like how you were saying how like if you got to fire someone, you know, where you want to get to the point where you're dealing with it in the beginning. You know, certain parts of your brain or chemistry is going to make you lean towards certain types of behavior, like impulsive behavior or something like that. You know, and they make sense when you get a new rash guard is like, where you get a new gear, something like, oh, can't wait to go practice in my new geek kind of thing. But if you're like, oh, you're asking, you know, this kind of question where, you know, is it wrong to sacrifice health and all this stuff? Basically, I think Dave and took his man out of no, but he was like, hey, you believe this, there, whatever, you know, they're, they're mad at me for, you know, pissing in the shower at the gym. You might be like, hey, jocco, you know what I do is I just, I always hit everyone with this little extra $12 charge, you know, no big deal, no one ever notices it. He's like, man, I gotta get the, he's like, I've, you know, my squads and charge to cleaning the showers. The further we go down that road, it gets harder and harder and harder because then you start saying, hey, you know, it's only, you know, we've been to gaming like 12 bucks. When I was in task in a bruiser, I didn't lay anything like that out for the platoon commanders, for life and the adult platoon commander and say, here's the brawls and I did that over a long period of time, over a year work up now that, now within a few months, they kind of knew what the deal was, but if I would have, if that would have been my normal job and I would have been getting a new platoon commanders every three months, every time they came in, I'll be like, are you a new platoon commander? Interesting how you, and it seems like this is the common theme to how you're, uh, like you want to try the most and the best you can to deal with it yourself, like the most for sure. Is that kind of like when you make a donation to charity, but you want like everyone to know that you did it. Like, one of those guy actually mentions this name before I'm like, I mentioned because pissing shower, but he's like talking to me while he's pissing in the shower. You know, so you really get the, to me is what it feels like is like, that's kind of how the book is supposed to feel. And they even have like rat, like I said, rash guards, the rash guards like if you work for frag mob, it'll say staff on the back. Because really, you know, a lot of time your kids are like, all you have really, it feels like. He was like, okay, you know, he, he kind of did that, you know? Well, I think it was gladiator that movie when they're like, I don't know, it's like the emperor or something came up. And it's like, you know the kind of like, I'm not injured. But again, just like how you said, it's like, so it's like this big burden in life. You know, it's a complete, just like lifting, like with lifting, you need nutrition. And that, you know, you have a, I don't know, disagreement, any, any ripples in the water where the instinct is to point fingers, you know. I'm just going to have to live with it or wait for, you know, the time where I don't know how to skip workouts, whatever. And again, the interminute fact, like if you're talking about this, like, you just brought him to like 10,000 questions on Twitter. So like, you know, like, I mean, it's a litter, it's a litterer.
