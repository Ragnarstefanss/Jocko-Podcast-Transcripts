You know one thing you you mentioned a couple times was you know that the fact that we we got an average age of Well, there's that your company your prior company was 54 years old As you know, I'm also in the business of people working with their hands We've got we've got people that are manufacturing things in America that haven't been manufactured a long time here Passing on we were lucky enough to grab some of that knowledge You know Pete was lucky enough to grab some of that knowledge from some of these people that were older than 54 years old You know that were 65 we've lost some of those those mentors at origin that were passing on first hand knowledge of how to do this stuff and yeah, that's the idea I think You you mentioned that Who's going to a technical schools nowadays you know it's just I don't even know Like the high school or my kids went they they don't they are trying now to reopen the the the Auto motive you know repair section when I went to high school all the kids were working on cars It was part of you know everyone was building their own car and and doing that and then a lot of them went on to do that for a living Where's that where who's gonna do this stuff now if we don't refocus America on On the the skills that we need as a nation to be self-sufficient Could not agree more just don't need to say more could not agree more and If it's not done, Jocca there would be real ramifications to it So you got to run that game Get around those numbers in your head because if you're investing all your time into into make money So that you can buy your time back you might be losing you know Unless you figure out a way to scale it which is what you were just talking about unless you figured out a way to scale it You're gonna have a hard time doing that so that's why it's important in my opinion to be doing something that you really love doing You know, I never even ever thought I was working in While I was in the Navy probably let me rephrase up I was very seldom considering what I was doing work Just didn't seem like work ever Like just didn't seem like work so that's a really good life. I'll lie you to man, you know monetize that great build and they go live your life and do your thing and So that that notion was was was always in my mind After you know doing private equity at that point for you know 15 years a 13 years or something like that It was always in my mind and then the event at hunt kind of catapult that right into existence I formed it I was gonna put these three portfolio companies and then and you know I ran around spend and the money part of things is a real easy one to kind of gravitate to as far as your attention and like maybe a lot of time Your value system because like like obviously guys like Matt where that's they're interested in that part of things You know the fine he wanted to be an investment banker and you know that's not like a rare thing And nothing necessarily but bro. I think We could talk a lot about this, but You know the push for college of the last 20 30 years and if you look at the stats I think since 1990 College enrollments up 60% Cost adjusted for inflation is up like 300% Subsidized 100% Subsidized by the government and making loans just like just like the mortgage just like the mortgage crash They're making loans to people That Not necessarily can be able to pay those loans back because you go to college for four years and it cost $380,000 and the job that you get with your degree when you leave that school is a $32,000 or $38,000 Your job that's what that's what's happening They they take money out of the business to You know by a house or second house or boat or you know that we call those lifestyle businesses and Their nice lifestyle business, but there's no long-term viability and health for those things They though they'll die as soon as that better owner dies So what like kind of almost like they have the business just so they can make money for their lifestyle That's right. And then I think look there has to be some kind of mindset that that says oh We as a country need to unite around developing more skill trades and pushing it back down to the high school I don't know if you know, but I don't know any high schools that really have you know that kind of craft It's You get the life you give yourself Like their externalities that have happened in your life and sometimes you can't affect them you can't do anything about them But the end of the day If you decide to get up you have the discipline to get up and get after it every day and you make it a priority You can change your course of your life and all we're doing as at groundworks is using that mindset on a business that changes 4200 lies Sounds cool now, but when when you know those slim criss-misses when you know when when I'm begging my wife to To allow us to send you know eight dudes to a mustard and DC it wasn't that way The the the the the investment that you make right so this is this is the thing that's very interesting That's what does it and That attitude That attitude that work ethic that's the American culture And and look the American culture might get might get pushed around a little bit it might get it might get some layers Put on it by various things that are going on in the world, but the American culture of Hard work the culture of Entrepreneurship and the culture that Superseeds all those Is the culture of taking care of your family taking care of your friends taking care of your community taking care of your people That's the American way and that's how you win and thank you for being an example of making that happen Thank you sir and with that Mr. Matt Malone has left the building so That will turn off yes, sir Did you get a little bit of the Beyond the shark tank on that because for you I think I think I think in your mind business is kind of like shark tank Actually you're kind of right. and you know that's why I don't know if it's gonna I don't know if you know our culture is gonna match I'm very very exciting stuff, right so imagine how broker dealers clear trades literally clear trades You know equity trades are cleared but also you know Municipal bond trades how the technology works and how the processes and the regulation around clearing those trades and how these systems have to work together To do that and they had they had they had started clearing trades for a bunch of different mama pop broker dealers and some big ones and so You know think about it from a business standpoint. It's an American supply chain and then like you said We're employing Americans and we got people that are are building this country and and taking these skills You know how to conversation with someone's talking about You know people people not being fit for the military right you can sure you've seen articles like that and I know you feel strongly about bringing manufacturing back to the United States If we don't start building skill trades and a women in this country there will be a colossal collapse Think about everything we do like all these great high-tech companies and everything they do Well someone's got to run the electrical electrician lines there or the gas lines there or build those skyscrapers or whatever it might be The blue collar skill trade men and women in this country have been forgotten and You know it really came to roost for me as we started build now a shipyard staffing because the age Really scared me right What's just Look at economics was pure I want I wanted to to learn more about You know the economy and how to be effective in business and things like that, but My curiosity was really what drove Religion right so imagine going to school at a Catholic school for almost my childhood and Then of course, I'm a piscuit paying about just fascinated with the idea of of How religions are Historically rolled out and maintained and they are fed their effect on You know mankind So we took every penny that we had from those things pot of right pick and the groundworks, but still wasn't enough So in 19 You know we decided now I had outside investors I had some friends and family, you know like folks that that I've seen and and been friends with No institutional no big money guys We wanted to continue this mission and I had worked for four or five years developing relationships of companies to buy some big ones and so I Finally had to bite the bullet and and bring on a financial partner JP D'Nell Carlos Corey Cody rather and then this this young guy flanned caucran back in the day You know they would lead that process for us and and really Again, not to sound like a promotion what they became part of the team like JP knows my team and He can relate the stories of our business and the construction component of our business and a way that Ties it into extreme ownership and how it applies to our business every day and That is how you really learn and that that's how it's absorbed and so Your team's done a really good job at that for us and you might know these guys so I was a lifeguard of all things in high school Believe or not so I worked at this ocean view Life beach patrol and Good gig paid a lot more than marina didn't have to work as hard you can kind of work out and have some fun You're not be reading the lead paint Right down your throw does I look at it Now you know people always joke. and You know he Bob mentioned you need to go hide this guy so move back to Just outside of Washington DC and mind you look This is kind of surreal for me, right so went to college Flying around with an asset to buy stock exchanges That's weird Then working for the presence brother, you know Super nice guy super smart hated politics but legitimate business man and learned a ton from him what does that look like and and I just knew I wanted to have the tools to do that job I could go into business and be successful it was later That I learned kind of what specifically I wanted to be involved with in business as I met some some mentors, but At Hampton Sydney now I just knew I wanted to get some degree and and and that I felt like could best prepare me to be a successful Business and so I did my as I said I got this North of Foundation scholarship, right? oh I see the alignment between Oh decentralized command well late to see I got a bunch of disaggregated people I got small elements that are going out in the field They've got to understand how they're gonna interact with the customer that's how we're gonna get good feedback That's how we're gonna grow our business. and I was like Can't they maybe out of it because you know, you know like you know when you're hiding something on purpose and You know I started this whole thing off saying leadership is the most important thing on the battlefield in business and Life and to look at a company like yours where you are proving How that works and how important it is and how you can grow things and how you can have 4200 employees and I'd love to you know if you are fishing for a compliment say no But mad at all starts with you. and you want to you want to take a little extra time to Understand the financial part of it if you have that mindset You can run you can run any kind of business that you want so don't think when I'm sitting here or Matt sitting here saying hey, we need people that are gonna know how to weld We do So I like to be the first and in last out Even at this big company that I run Because it sets the tone that you know, I'm not some Exactly that's gonna mail it in if we're gonna go after our mission We're gonna go after And so you know I got to pick it land or Charlotte to do that and I opened my my office for Hunt private equity and and Charlotte North Carolina and did you know did some cool deals It was fun again think about the progression here of Marvin to Ray and these are some you know players players Fast-word a few years as you this was then OA-09 the world's gone badly. And they've earned it, but all these young overnight miners walking around I always felt like you can bring that same mindset to a skilled trades business You could and we're going to prove that it can be done and by doing that I'm going to track world-class talent to this business if you're at another home services company today if you're at you know window company or I won't say any company names, but if you're at any any company and you want to get after it But I was able to at that point engage in a business from operational standpoint leverage everything that I'd learned in private equity over the years in terms of investing in process technology people And Started to realize the importance of Investing in skill tradesmen and women and it wasn't really till I got there that I realized it deficit in the country as it relates to skill trades now We'll talk a little bit about that a minute, but so built that company We actually tripled that business in about two years Making so much money from that business that I was able to buy another company Called shipyard staffing so that that business is skill trade labor to the shipyards and so At once and I spent you know close to eight years there doing deals so private equity deals so we would buy companies And invest and I would not break them you know, so at this point is traditional private equity We'd buy these small companies we would invest in them sit on the boards You know try to Provide wisdom It stands out blatantly obvious and that's the that's what I think happens inside these companies that we work with where You get this attitude of ownership and when it starts to sink in Anybody on the team that's like well, you know, that's actually is it my fault It is like so obvious to everyone and eventually it becomes obvious to yourself Eventually as you're about to say well, you know, this isn't really my fault. It's it's it's real and so I was gonna bring some of my leaders and I have a partner so this fellow Jesse Walts invested back into the business with me and he's a minority shareholder at the time and and You know as I can't run this through the company because you know He's not really happy with me at the moment anyway even though I'm an already guy I want to keep him happy and respect him We got origin USA check out that YouTube channel psychological warfare got all that stuff going on flip side canvas to code a mile By the way, he's I don't even know when this podcast is coming up, but he's an in Ukraine right now Just just be in Dakota God bless him If you want to support his company while he's over in Ukraine like saving people by the way He saves people in America too. I said hey, Mar I think I'm gonna think I'm gonna go I think you know You don't want to be part of the firm that's What we had at that time we only had three active portfolio companies we just started actively investing and and came all three of those were my companies And there was kind of this decision to make About what are we gonna do with these companies if things go really bad how are we gonna support them things like that and mind you hunt although Very wealthy he has other interests in particular energy and we're in energy company takes a lot of capital and You know finally move back to retire Norfolk and and that's how you know my parents met so it's you know Navy towns are a lot of examples like that. Oh no John and Chris fuzzle worked As lifeguards with me back in the day I had those of you John fuzzle was the guy that would just Work out maniac like hanging off lifeguard sand's digging holes and You know when I when I mentioned it the flan did you know this guy so you kidding right? I'll buy that service business You can capitalize your software business with the proceeds of the service business that I was kind of bought So he invented the software business to support his foundation business and I said look I ain't gonna buy that software business and he's running a freaking you know he's running a giant Giant company that's that's moving money billions of dollars look at all these founders out These big founders the big name founders as you see out there musk and feel and and Duck and all these guys They don't have a degree I call them zuck at like I don't know Now I'm in Norfolk at 1635 Mopiav a new thousand square foot building Moving houses are swaced around my office literally was like it has like the The old wooden plywood would like then not real wood like the plywood stuff Like wood paneling right so you blow your knee Can't walk I was literally in the hospital like southeast DC not the greatest kind of hospital that you want to be in and Literally in that bed I said I'm not going back Not I'm not meaning Catholic, but I'm not going back to Norfolk I'm not gonna go back What I got to do right so Turned on the brain I finished the semester there had a three two which is Do you think that in your company what you'd rather do is Spread yourself so thin over so many different things at the same time that you can't effectively do anything It is that what you're thinking and decentralized commander are you are you thinking that you don't want to empower your Subordinate leaders you want all decisions to be run through some central location and even the idea of extreme ownership Are what you think and is this doesn't match with your culture because your culture is we're gonna all sit around and blame each other and point fingers each other so like There's no Leadership human in the world that disagrees with these principles You just can't they're they're they're universal principles that are foundational to leading other human beings I don't care about those games because Basically the games we're talking about right now are all business financial earning games Because you know you got a game that you're playing to win with your family to win with your legacy to pass on good behaviors to your children to help your community to build good relationships like there's that too Your health your health and You know he he really became somewhere that I looked forward to talking to and his name was Bob Hatcher and and Bob had started a company that Called Johnson and Higgins which was one of the largest insurance brokerage firms in the world he later sold it to Martian They are the largest and you know, I don't know what he was worth but it was a lot So in first grade, you know mom would walk me out to the bus stop 45 50 minute drive on the bus to a school Young park elementary, you know, it's literally in the middle of the project and it did you know they were crossed down bus and so That lasted for a couple years and mom had enough of it They were bringing in all different types of People to do trade businesses to do trade so if the three of us start our broker dealer we would hired them They do all our back-end stuff as big as you know the big guys on the street First clearing corpus the name of it What they would do their work too Well, anyway, I got into this project to figure out how to make that more for business and things like that again Just waiting out to get to the investment banking
