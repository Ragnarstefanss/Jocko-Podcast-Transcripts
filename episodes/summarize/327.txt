wow well more people are going to hear here this version then that version how you like that go and back to the account now the torpedo boats began firing it us with machine guns shooting anything that moved including firefighters and stretcher bears one of the guys I was pulling to safety got hit right above the knee with a 50 caliber slot causing explosion of blood and bone I took off my shirt and tied the sleeves around the top of his leg as tight as I could to stop the bleeding we got him down to the mess decks and untied the turnic it for just a few seconds so that they wouldn't be forced to amputate the leg later then we retided before leaving the area a median I went back up to the main deck and saw that that the gunners on the torpedo boats were now shooting at the ship on the waterline aiming in the direction of the boilers and from merely 35 yards away clearly they were trying now to blow up the ship by hitting the boilers and causing a huge explosion that their last torpedo had failed to accomplish throughout the course the torpedo boat attacked they circled the ship like voltiers at as close as a hundred feet to suggest that they might have missed the huge lettering on both sides of the bow in ten foot high letters as well as the USS Liberty lettering on the stern seems impossible and you're sitting there seeing these guys just lay into you with 50 caliber machine guns from a hundred yards away yes sir and nothing to fight back with the are willing and which and the pleasure of taking another breath is what kept us all going and pretty fortunate to be here jacco i saw one of the torpedo boats a lot closer than a hundred yards one of the miles on the port wing of bridges I spent a lot of time out there making sure the flag was flying and I saw one of the torpedo boats sail very slowly at our port support side I didn't see him fire anything I know that Phil had two or three books at Hevero the one that you referenced earlier about Ron and Cookele Phil's also a contributor to that book and Ernest Gallo is another member of the crew that helped you know with that how long were you in the Navy for 21 years you get a purple heart for being wounded on I did and what would you tell people when some other you know you're out you're you're just whites for whatever reason and you know 1975 there's guys were in Vietnam sure some you know guys there's some it's corpsmen some medics some pilots some aviators might have got purple hearts some some guys from the sea wolves or something but there's not a lot of navy guys running around in 1975 1980 1985 that had purple hearts what did you say to somebody when they said hey where did you get that purple heart from I was on the U.S. a celebrity in 1967 when we were attacked and you know I got it for Shrept and wounds and that was about it you know and i if you want to hear more from us then you can go on the social media of course surge in general warning watch out for the aglorism because it's getting ready grab you by the trope and try and drag you in there echoes at aquatrol's i am a joccal willing and thanks once again to joe larry and fill for your service in sacrifice and thanks to all the sailors of the us s liberty especially those 34 brave souls who sacrificed their lives for their shipmates and thanks to all the rest of the sailors out there from the world's finest navy that are on the high seas 365 days a year protecting the cause of freedom around the world and thanks to the rest of our military that fights on the land and in the air to protect our way of life and also to our police and law enforcement fire fighters paramedics entese dispatchers correction officers board patrol secret service all first responders who protect us here at home thank you for what you do and everyone else you never know what you're going to run into you never know what's going to happen you never know who is going to attack you and these guys talked about it today they were prepared they were ready they were vigilant so when something unfolds you are prepared like they were to behave like they did the brave sailors of the us s liberty and don't ever give up and until next time the zeco and jocco out and I mean there was information that I knew should have been in there that had to deal with communications that that didn't reflect those communications and the thing that they were trying to report more than anything else was a lack of communications that occurred resulting from this hundred mile um free zone I guess that Israel had declared no no ship should enter into that hundred miles zone off the coast of Sinai and apparently our naval atoshae and um and Israel had told them that we don't have any navy ships there six fleet confirmed that they didn't have any any naval ships there and that's you know a problem with us traveling by ourselves that they they they didn't recognize that we were over there or they conveniently forgot that we were there but there was communications that were supposed to have been sent us telling us to move back off the coast and we never received those communications and so that's more about what this report from NSA said and it didn't talk about the other intercepts that had you know the aircraft talking to ground control we're talking about the target talking about seeing the American flag and you know I don't know why that didn't come out until later but we kept doing a freedom movement information act requests trying to get a lot of this documentation back out in the public so the truth could be told so Joe what did you do after the incident so place how much longer were you in the navy for did you stay and what did you do I got out you know one of the things that it said is what you said earlier Phil which is hey if the is Rayleigh's could get the Americans into this war in a big way you know that can really help us out against these Arabs is what is Rayleigh was thinking and these kind of things happen what is what do you guys do with the LBA now what's what's the purpose how can people help well one of the things that we're still trying to do is get recognition for our 34th fall in shipmates we've tried over the years to get Congress to conduct a fallen impartial investigation and it's fallen on deaf ears right now we've got a resolution going forward to the ask for June 8th to be declared as a US celebrity remembered stay it should be a fairly simple thing for Congress to do I mean we have national hot dog day in national you know ice cream day let's have a national US as Liberty remembered stay and not just one year but every year and you know if nothing else you're you're honoring the 34 men that gave the ultimate sacrifice back on June 8th 1967 when when you talk about some of the awards that were received most every one of us that received any kind of an award purple heart or prom star you know the Congressional Medal of Honor it was all done in private there were no big ceremonies like you would normally expect for you know someone with that just came off the most decorated ship in the United States Navy since World War II and you know 95% of the American public is not even aware but you know Jacob he said something very interesting about the American Legion which fires me up because about four or five years ago Len Hall of the and Ernest Gallo our former president we're at the convention in the American Legion and they're wanted to get a booth and things like this and we hung out together in better times playing card strength if you beers and joking together we just locked eyes and communicated silently that we might not make it through this one I went off to find more CO2 canisters and I ran back towards the bridge falling in the process which caused the CO2 canister to fly out of my hands and crashed down the deck with a bang as soon as I got up I saw that I saw what it caused me to slip and fall it was blood on the deck that hadn't been there moments before when I left the bridge it was my friend Francis Brown's blood who had caught a machine gun bullet or a piece of shrapnel in the back of his head and his blood was everywhere his eyes were closed but his face was swelled up like a balloon there was something that no human being should ever have to see especially when it's a good friend of yours in a little while after going below deck and seeing more scenes like that I looked like a slaughterhouse with a cacophony of wailing and desperation in the background the wounded men kept begging me to help them and it was frustrating for me not to be able to do that because I had to move them from the passageways into the mess hall so they could get the medical attention they needed finally the jet attack was over and I went back to the top deck and then saw Torbito boats coming at us at a high rate of speed and now I saw who it was the star of David Flags flying above these boats was quite a surprise and at first I assumed they were coming to our rescue the delusion only lasted a minute because I then saw the splash of several torpedoes that they dropped into the water as they headed towards us did you know they were torpedoes and you know we we had no way to defend ourselves and you guys mentioned this already but just to just to reiterate there was some heroic activity to place for people for some of your shipmates to get onto the deck of the ship and string up a long wire antenna and send out an SOS message and that actually made it to to six feet which was you know like I talked earlier about big groups of ships and you guys traveled solo but normally the US Navy travels and big groups of ships so that was the six fleet is one of these big groups of ships had an aircraft carrier and whatnot and they actually received the SOS that you guys were on travel under attack and and talk me through about what you know about how that how the response the rescue response got shut down very good question we didn't learn quite a while exactly why it went forward but I didn't realize that I had the strap and the wounds in my thigh because you're adrenaline is pumping so so fast that and you're taking care of others so I had blood from trying to take care of John Spicer and you know working with some of the other wounded that my my dongries were just kind of blood soaked and I didn't find out until I don't know I guess a day or two later when one of the doctors from one of the other ships was up in the dispensary and they were you know evaluating us to determine whether or not we'd sustained any injuries and of course I had a drop trial when he said how did you get those you know scars on your leg there and strap no wounds I said I don't know I was to bend there in the torpedo attack but as far as working through the night we did whatever we could to try and you know keep keep everyone calm it wasn't chaotic and it's covered with gray paint which might have saved his life since it became a giant bandage so that's the that's kind of the situation that took place where you that's what you received the bronze star for was that action going out into into the into the fire to try and recover wounded guys you continue here after all the wounded had been recovered I went to the log room the location of damage control central I saw and some John D scout there my superior officer who is burning documents the standard procedure in US military after briefing him and discussing the situation for a few minutes he ordered me to return to the deck to further assess the damages and put out any fires that were still burning on the way back I saw many wounded men bloody and moaning begging me for help but as I had no medical training there was not much I could do to help relieve their pain I got to the bridge and saw a commander at Nagel was badly wounded in the leg but still in command rocket and cannon holes were everywhere and burning napalm was dripping through the holes into the bridge compartment there were CO2 canisters that were not effective in fighting that kind of fire and I requested a team with water hoses but that didn't work either since the fire hoses had been shot up just like everything else I told the captain that I would return with some better equipment to fight the fires and he calmly replied do what you can sailor he was always very professional and stoic even under these incredibly violence surreal circumstances so you have napalm dripping through the holes onto the bridge I mean that's just crazy to think about it is crazy it is crazy it's a war crime dropping it on dropping it on us they wouldn't they they couldn't shoot us up so they tried to burn us up and the fire is just basically burn out because we couldn't put them out we didn't have the equipment COT CO2 was all gone everything was been had been utilized and so I go from a singleman school to a ship that doesn't need a signalman to a ship that has a very very intense signalman but after that I went I got out Halloween on 69 and same question to you I mean were you thinking to yourself what's one of the reasons you got out because you're thinking hey this crazy thing just happened to me I lost so many of my friends and now I'm told I can never talk about it again did that impact the way you thought about your career interesting thing about that um on this Elvenia there was a uh career counselor and every time you were getting short you would call you in this office and give you a long-speel about why you should trip over and stay in the navy so he didn't know he didn't know me personally and they didn't know my history so he called me into his office sat down really had one job and that was to know what was flying what the ship was flying and you know 100% that that that that the American flag was clearly visible and that you actually ended up raising an even bigger American flag that's right you know I might add to that uh jacco the uh is really war room had his plotted on their map as American and friendly they said they changed the watch and inadvertently forgot we were there and took us off their war table I mean come on man you know when you when you change watches you you inform everybody of what's going on and they just took it all the way and that's uh still it or it takes me and then he labored assault troops it was obvious to me and most people that their intention was to sink the ship and kill old any survivors speaking of that the the he-low-born assault troops here we go shortly after the boats left the scene from far off in the distance but closing in fast came the unmistaker will want want want want sound of a very large troop carrying helicopter approaching the ship on the starboard side now the one MC system blared all ships personnel prepared to rebel repel borders so now after all other weapons were brought to bear on our ship and failed the sinker we were about to be bordered by Marines armed with sub machine guns after the only machine guns on the ship had been destroyed in the wave of first attacks even if we could get to them in time the only other guns we had on the ship were small arms pistols and a couple of shot guns that we might use to set up a last line of defense a median eye tried to open the locker with our fire axes since our master at arms who is the only one with a key was not to be found even after beating that lock nearly pieces we could not break it the commandos on board the helicopter above appeared to be ready to repel on to our ship ready for close quarters combat with a bunch of defenses for drag-led sailors worn out from two hours of sustained attacks it would have been a turkey shoot I think we better just go get them that's just that was the whole is a land grab for Israel and in a power grab for LBGA to keep these war machine going in Vietnam and it's not like you guys got helped quickly you say this it's 18 hours a hell to call it a long night is a big understatement none of us slept for two reasons first we were afraid of the dark not like little kids but rather because we knew that criminals prefer the cover of darkness when doing their dirty work those responsible for the previous days attack might return to the scene of the crime to finish what they had failed to do earlier second we didn't know if the ship would even stay together although we were not sure of the exact size the whole in the starboard side we knew that it was big very big it was a lot of work that wouldn't be needed just to keep the ship afloat and moving away from the dangerous zone and with all the men killed or wounded only a skeleton crew remained to do this those of us who did survive were glad of that of course and then they just sail off and continue to attack how much time had passed between the initial strafing runs from the aircraft to the torpedo attack and is this an hour has gone by two hours or approximately two hours some people save more some people probably say less but to do that type of damage and in a few moments like these really said it just took a little while they only said they had only three aircraft that attacked us and there was probably twenty aircraft so to attack us to do that kind of damaging that's for the time it's just when you think back three airplanes can't carry the munitions would take to put over eight hundred fifty cannon rocket holes in the ship drop napalmons and just it doesn't make sense so as all this is going on you say all of the sounds of these machine guns and the sheer hell taking place might have been the reason why there was some controversy of whether commander mechanical ordered all crew prepared to abandon ship
