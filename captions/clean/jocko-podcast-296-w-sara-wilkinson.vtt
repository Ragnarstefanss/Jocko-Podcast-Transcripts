00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
This is Jocco podcast number two, 96 with me, Jocco Willink.

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.72
The Chief of Naval Operations takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star Medal to Special

3
00:00:12.72 --> 00:00:20.04
Warfare Operator First Class, Chad M. Wilkinson, United States Navy.

4
00:00:20.04 --> 00:00:28.48
For service as set forth in the following citation, for conspicuous gallantry and

5
00:00:28.48 --> 00:00:34.08
intrapetity in action against the enemy while serving as a mission support sight team leader

6
00:00:34.08 --> 00:00:41.56
while assigned to a joint task force in support of operations in during the freedom on 24 April

7
00:00:41.56 --> 00:00:43.72
2011.

8
00:00:43.72 --> 00:00:50.64
The officer Wilkinson displayed superior guidance during a daytime assault targeting a Taliban

9
00:00:50.64 --> 00:00:56.52
commander while under significant enemy fire.

10
00:00:56.52 --> 00:01:01.88
Upon arriving into the objective area, Petty Officer Wilkinson and his assault element came

11
00:01:01.88 --> 00:01:06.12
under a hail of enemy fire.

12
00:01:06.12 --> 00:01:13.08
He and his teammates led his assault to set containment on the objective area.

13
00:01:13.08 --> 00:01:17.88
After receiving friendly wounded in action from direct enemy fires and grenades within 20

14
00:01:17.88 --> 00:01:24.36
meters of the target compound, Petty Officer Wilkinson boldly exposed himself to the enemy

15
00:01:24.36 --> 00:01:28.92
and suppressed the incoming fire that allowed his element to move to safety and enable

16
00:01:28.92 --> 00:01:37.32
the combat medic to move to their positions to treat a head wound of one of his teammates.

17
00:01:37.32 --> 00:01:42.24
He directed two additional assaults on the target compound and coordinated with higher

18
00:01:42.24 --> 00:01:48.76
headquarters for three rotary wing, close air support missions after evacuating all non-combatants

19
00:01:48.76 --> 00:01:53.000
from adjacent buildings.

20
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.20
Petty Officer Wilkinson's actions eliminated the enemy combatants, enabled the evacuation

21
00:01:58.20 --> 00:02:06.72
of the wounded casualties and allowed for the safe extraction of the assault force.

22
00:02:06.72 --> 00:02:13.56
By his bold leadership courageous actions and total dedication to duty, Petty Officer Wilkinson

23
00:02:13.56 --> 00:02:19.28
reflected great credit upon himself and upheld the highest traditions of the United States

24
00:02:19.28 --> 00:02:31.32
Naval Service for the President Jonathan W. Greenert Admiral United States Navy chief of

25
00:02:31.32 --> 00:02:38.84
naval operations.

26
00:02:38.84 --> 00:02:52.52
So there you have the award citation of a hero from one of our recent wars.

27
00:02:52.52 --> 00:02:55.80
Afghanistan.

28
00:02:55.80 --> 00:03:02.80
And war is in some ways timeless.

29
00:03:02.80 --> 00:03:16.48
There are heroes, there are sacrifices, and there's fear and pain and loss.

30
00:03:16.48 --> 00:03:24.92
And war also evolves over time and there's new weapons, new technology, new tactics,

31
00:03:24.92 --> 00:03:35.16
there's lessons that are learned, there's solutions that are created with the advent of

32
00:03:35.16 --> 00:03:36.16
poison gas.

33
00:03:36.16 --> 00:03:41.84
World War I came the advent of the gas mask.

34
00:03:41.84 --> 00:03:48.64
From the creation of machine guns came the creation of the tank.

35
00:03:48.64 --> 00:03:56.48
Was responsible for the creation or the advancement of radios and radar and atomic weapons

36
00:03:56.48 --> 00:04:03.92
and energy and jet engines and electric computers and war creates problems.

37
00:04:03.92 --> 00:04:10.28
I think create solutions to those problems.

38
00:04:10.28 --> 00:04:18.20
Or at least it's supposed to.

39
00:04:18.20 --> 00:04:25.60
There've been great advances in medicine from war.

40
00:04:25.60 --> 00:04:34.16
The Civil War in America brought about the significant use of anesthesia.

41
00:04:34.16 --> 00:04:40.52
The World War I men were now being gravely wounded by these newly developed machine guns

42
00:04:40.52 --> 00:04:42.92
and they were losing massive quantities of blood.

43
00:04:42.92 --> 00:04:49.60
And so doctors started regularly using blood transfusions for the first time.

44
00:04:49.60 --> 00:04:59.48
World War II saw the expanded use of antibiotics to fight off infections.

45
00:04:59.48 --> 00:05:05.56
World War II's also where they started using metal plates to repair broken bones and fractures

46
00:05:05.56 --> 00:05:08.88
from these explosions, from these new weapons.

47
00:05:08.88 --> 00:05:14.28
And the Korean War helped advance the idea of life flights.

48
00:05:14.28 --> 00:05:18.96
Then using helicopters to get wounded soldiers the care that they needed is quickly

49
00:05:18.96 --> 00:05:24.92
as possible.

50
00:05:24.92 --> 00:05:32.96
And the Vietnam War started using Nae Palm regularly.

51
00:05:32.96 --> 00:05:36.76
Not brought about advances in burn care.

52
00:05:36.76 --> 00:05:45.60
And they started using antiseptic and antibiotic infused the dressings to reduce infection.

53
00:05:45.60 --> 00:06:02.80
So war creates new forms of physical trauma and then creates ways to help ease that trauma.

54
00:06:02.80 --> 00:06:07.12
And then there's unseen trauma.

55
00:06:07.12 --> 00:06:19.44
And the conclusive blasts, the traumatic stress every war has its own form.

56
00:06:19.44 --> 00:06:22.48
And World War I, it was shell shock.

57
00:06:22.48 --> 00:06:28.48
And the horror of going over the top.

58
00:06:28.48 --> 00:06:33.88
World War II, the dreadfulness of close killing.

59
00:06:33.88 --> 00:06:41.64
The Vietnam, the confusion over who's good and who's bad.

60
00:06:41.64 --> 00:06:49.06
In our current modern wars, there's something else to contend with for our professional

61
00:06:49.06 --> 00:06:53.68
warriors.

62
00:06:53.68 --> 00:06:59.48
And that is the idea of an unending war.

63
00:06:59.48 --> 00:07:09.04
Because World War I, as heinous and awful as it was, was also finite.

64
00:07:09.04 --> 00:07:11.04
World War II is similar.

65
00:07:11.04 --> 00:07:14.84
I mean absolute horror, yes.

66
00:07:14.84 --> 00:07:21.000
But a horror that ended in four years.

67
00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.60
Korean War lasted three years.

68
00:07:22.60 --> 00:07:29.84
Korean War is also where we started to see this idea of tours where soldiers would go over

69
00:07:29.84 --> 00:07:32.84
and do a tour.

70
00:07:32.84 --> 00:07:36.52
And then go home.

71
00:07:36.52 --> 00:07:38.52
And that was it.

72
00:07:38.52 --> 00:07:41.88
And the same thing in Vietnam.

73
00:07:41.88 --> 00:07:43.04
We all kind of know that story.

74
00:07:43.04 --> 00:07:45.60
Service members were required to do their hitch.

75
00:07:45.60 --> 00:07:49.24
And now.

76
00:07:49.24 --> 00:07:57.32
One year, count the days.

77
00:07:57.32 --> 00:08:04.92
And in all those cases, for a majority of soldiers, war was a finite thing.

78
00:08:04.92 --> 00:08:12.56
Yes, brutal, yes, horrific, yes, sickening.

79
00:08:12.56 --> 00:08:18.28
But had an endpoint.

80
00:08:18.28 --> 00:08:29.96
So many of this generation, our current generation, there's been no endpoint insight.

81
00:08:29.96 --> 00:08:41.42
It's been a constant exposure to violence, conclusive explosions, stress, deployment after

82
00:08:41.42 --> 00:08:46.04
deployment after deployment after deployment.

83
00:08:46.04 --> 00:08:52.84
And the training is elevated to, and that's repetitive over and over and over again.

84
00:08:52.84 --> 00:08:59.76
Explosive breaching of doors, firing rockets over and over again, improvised demolition shots,

85
00:08:59.76 --> 00:09:09.000
and then back on deployment again.

86
00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:22.28
And that can become a never-ending cycle of trauma.

87
00:09:22.28 --> 00:09:36.04
And that's taken its toll on the mental health of some of our nation's finest warriors.

88
00:09:36.04 --> 00:09:47.52
And like, Chad Wilkinson, who received that silver star and who finally met his end,

89
00:09:47.52 --> 00:09:55.84
not on the battlefield by the hands of the enemy.

90
00:09:55.84 --> 00:10:12.60
Who sadly took his own life with suicide.

91
00:10:12.60 --> 00:10:17.84
And we have to learn from that.

92
00:10:17.84 --> 00:10:25.52
And here today to talk to us about Chad, and what he went through is his wife.

93
00:10:25.52 --> 00:10:32.72
Sarah Wilkinson, and joining her as Jason McCarthy, former Special Forces soldier, founder

94
00:10:32.72 --> 00:10:36.56
of Go Rock, and a friend of Sarah's.

95
00:10:36.56 --> 00:10:40.96
And together, they had been trying to share the message of mental health, remove the

96
00:10:40.96 --> 00:10:49.52
stigma's raise awareness, and encourage people to reach out if they need help.

97
00:10:49.52 --> 00:10:56.000
And encourage us all to help each other.

98
00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.96
With that, Sarah, Jason.

99
00:10:58.96 --> 00:10:59.96
Thank you for joining us.

100
00:10:59.96 --> 00:11:00.96
Thank you.

101
00:11:00.96 --> 00:11:03.24
Good to see you guys again.

102
00:11:03.24 --> 00:11:05.08
Yeah, Jason came on before.

103
00:11:05.08 --> 00:11:12.84
You're on podcast 208 talking about your experiences in the Special Forces, in Florida,

104
00:11:12.84 --> 00:11:14.64
tennis champion.

105
00:11:14.64 --> 00:11:15.64
Almost championed.

106
00:11:15.64 --> 00:11:19.44
My mom was the dad of the mental growth champion.

107
00:11:19.44 --> 00:11:21.84
And Sarah, thank you so much for coming out.

108
00:11:21.84 --> 00:11:24.000
It's very, very awesome to meet you.

109
00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:29.04
And I just want to, you know, get right into your story and the story of you and Chad.

110
00:11:29.04 --> 00:11:31.56
And let's start at the beginning.

111
00:11:31.56 --> 00:11:35.56
Where you from, where'd you grow up, how did it all start?

112
00:11:35.56 --> 00:11:39.08
I'm a military kid born, born, bread.

113
00:11:39.08 --> 00:11:40.48
My dad was marine.

114
00:11:40.48 --> 00:11:42.44
I'm the youngest of two.

115
00:11:42.44 --> 00:11:44.32
I have an older sister.

116
00:11:44.32 --> 00:11:47.64
My mom and dad met pretty young and got married.

117
00:11:47.64 --> 00:11:52.60
My dad joined the military, became a marine, and set off their path to move around every

118
00:11:52.60 --> 00:11:54.24
couple of years.

119
00:11:54.24 --> 00:11:55.92
Was he from a military family?

120
00:11:55.92 --> 00:11:56.92
No.

121
00:11:56.92 --> 00:11:59.16
He's randomly joined the Marine Corps.

122
00:11:59.16 --> 00:12:03.88
Uh, yeah, it was kind of like right where he just missed the draft.

123
00:12:03.88 --> 00:12:07.28
But yet, still felt the need to serve, I guess.

124
00:12:07.28 --> 00:12:12.08
He, they come from a small town in Ohio, where everyone kind of just stays in that same

125
00:12:12.08 --> 00:12:13.08
town.

126
00:12:13.08 --> 00:12:17.84
I think he wanted to find something bigger, maybe more challenging.

127
00:12:17.84 --> 00:12:18.84
I can relate.

128
00:12:18.84 --> 00:12:20.20
He wanted to serve his country.

129
00:12:20.20 --> 00:12:25.80
So yeah, his marine, I was a military kid, moved around all the time.

130
00:12:25.80 --> 00:12:30.08
My dad was an officer, so that means we moved every two to three years.

131
00:12:30.08 --> 00:12:32.48
We spent most of the time on the East Coast.

132
00:12:32.48 --> 00:12:36.96
We lived once overseas in Okinawa.

133
00:12:36.96 --> 00:12:42.000
And yeah, I, I mean, I went to 15 schools before I graduated.

134
00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.76
So do you become super adaptable when you go to 15 schools?

135
00:12:46.76 --> 00:12:51.08
I guess you could either come super adaptable or just super in a shell and not talk to

136
00:12:51.08 --> 00:12:52.08
anybody.

137
00:12:52.08 --> 00:12:53.08
I, I really think you could go either way.

138
00:12:53.08 --> 00:12:56.08
You're either out there or you're, or you're rigid.

139
00:12:56.08 --> 00:12:59.60
I consider myself more like a chameleon because of that.

140
00:12:59.60 --> 00:13:04.96
So I can blend in in a room where I can stand out what needs to happen.

141
00:13:04.96 --> 00:13:09.68
So growing up moving all the time, I mean, I went to a different school fifth, sixth,

142
00:13:09.68 --> 00:13:16.16
seventh, eighth, ninth grade, different school each year for those years.

143
00:13:16.16 --> 00:13:17.16
So yeah.

144
00:13:17.16 --> 00:13:18.64
And then, and so then what about Chad?

145
00:13:18.64 --> 00:13:20.20
When did you meet Chad?

146
00:13:20.20 --> 00:13:21.84
First day of high school.

147
00:13:21.84 --> 00:13:22.96
And where was this?

148
00:13:22.96 --> 00:13:24.96
A quannico Virginia.

149
00:13:24.96 --> 00:13:28.92
So so my dad marine, right quannico's marine corpace.

150
00:13:28.92 --> 00:13:30.84
And his dad was Navy.

151
00:13:30.84 --> 00:13:32.72
His dad was a former seal.

152
00:13:32.72 --> 00:13:34.72
His uncle was also a seal.

153
00:13:34.72 --> 00:13:39.16
So he always wanted to be a seal from the time he was like 12.

154
00:13:39.16 --> 00:13:41.36
But his dad had switched rates.

155
00:13:41.36 --> 00:13:46.28
And then was kind of on the helicopter duty with the president.

156
00:13:46.28 --> 00:13:50.88
And so that's what brought him to quannico.

157
00:13:50.88 --> 00:13:52.64
Because otherwise, I don't think we would have mad.

158
00:13:52.64 --> 00:13:54.000
He would have never been there.

159
00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.04
Yeah, we went to a really, really small school.

160
00:13:57.04 --> 00:13:58.68
It's a DOD high school.

161
00:13:58.68 --> 00:14:00.12
It doesn't exist anymore.

162
00:14:00.12 --> 00:14:04.60
So a high school that's on base that's just for the military kids.

163
00:14:04.60 --> 00:14:08.96
Our kids well behaved on the military school, on the military base school.

164
00:14:08.96 --> 00:14:12.32
Well, when I went, yes, because, you know, we're talking early 90s.

165
00:14:12.32 --> 00:14:17.92
But also on base, not on quannico when I moved to Lysun, this was the case.

166
00:14:17.92 --> 00:14:20.40
But a lot of times you would have a plaque in front of your house.

167
00:14:20.40 --> 00:14:24.72
So my house said there's a plaque that's at Colonel Trilice, out in front of her house.

168
00:14:24.72 --> 00:14:29.20
So you can really do too much because not only, you know, could they report to your dad.

169
00:14:29.20 --> 00:14:30.48
They knew where you live.

170
00:14:30.48 --> 00:14:32.64
So you're in a controlled environment.

171
00:14:32.64 --> 00:14:33.64
Pretty much, yeah.

172
00:14:33.64 --> 00:14:36.44
What kind of music were you listening to?

173
00:14:36.44 --> 00:14:39.88
Like grunge, you know, poppy type of music.

174
00:14:39.88 --> 00:14:41.40
Because what year is this?

175
00:14:41.40 --> 00:14:43.80
Well, when I met him, it was 91.

176
00:14:43.80 --> 00:14:47.000
So you're a freshman in high school in 91.

177
00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.08
Yeah, so it was kind of peak grunge.

178
00:14:49.08 --> 00:14:49.40
Yeah.

179
00:14:49.40 --> 00:14:51.000
You were just getting your Nirvana.

180
00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:51.80
Oh, yeah.

181
00:14:51.80 --> 00:14:52.60
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

182
00:14:52.60 --> 00:14:53.48
He loved Pearl.

183
00:14:53.48 --> 00:14:54.60
Yeah, yeah.

184
00:14:54.60 --> 00:14:55.24
Yeah.

185
00:14:55.24 --> 00:14:58.20
I still listen to it and just smile.

186
00:14:58.20 --> 00:15:00.80
So you guys meet and what?

187
00:15:00.80 --> 00:15:01.88
It was a love at first sight.

188
00:15:01.88 --> 00:15:02.88
Is there?

189
00:15:02.88 --> 00:15:03.72
For me?

190
00:15:03.72 --> 00:15:04.72
Oh, yeah.

191
00:15:04.72 --> 00:15:07.84
I mean, I don't know about him.

192
00:15:07.84 --> 00:15:13.12
Yeah, he, we, so go into a military school right off the bat the first day.

193
00:15:13.12 --> 00:15:16.72
There starts to be buzz about who the new kids are, who's this kid and this kid at

194
00:15:16.72 --> 00:15:18.20
the school is so, so small.

195
00:15:18.20 --> 00:15:20.56
And they were talking about the Wilkinson brothers.

196
00:15:20.56 --> 00:15:23.56
The girls were like, have you seen the Wilkinson brothers?

197
00:15:23.56 --> 00:15:25.24
I was like, what's the deal?

198
00:15:25.24 --> 00:15:31.56
But I smile because I just remember this so clearly sitting in the bleachers on the

199
00:15:31.56 --> 00:15:38.12
first day, traditional like PE coach just like intense colon roll and this kid was sitting

200
00:15:38.12 --> 00:15:39.12
in front of me.

201
00:15:39.12 --> 00:15:42.56
I saw the back of his head and they called Chad Wilkinson and he turned his head to the

202
00:15:42.56 --> 00:15:44.12
side and he said, here.

203
00:15:44.12 --> 00:15:46.68
And I was like, oh, well, I'm done.

204
00:15:46.68 --> 00:15:47.68
I like him.

205
00:15:47.68 --> 00:15:48.68
And that was it.

206
00:15:48.68 --> 00:15:50.48
How did you connect then?

207
00:15:50.48 --> 00:15:54.96
Well, I mean, a small school, we kind of, you, you just end being military kids.

208
00:15:54.96 --> 00:15:58.96
I think it was pretty natural for all of us to just be friends.

209
00:15:58.96 --> 00:16:03.52
There really wasn't like a cool group and a not cool group.

210
00:16:03.52 --> 00:16:07.20
Everybody, you were kind of forced to be friends with everybody because the school was so

211
00:16:07.20 --> 00:16:08.56
small and we got so small.

212
00:16:08.56 --> 00:16:10.16
How many people per grade?

213
00:16:10.16 --> 00:16:11.92
His graduating class was 24.

214
00:16:11.92 --> 00:16:12.92
I think.

215
00:16:12.92 --> 00:16:13.92
Oh, 24.

216
00:16:13.92 --> 00:16:14.92
That is really small.

217
00:16:14.92 --> 00:16:15.92
Yeah.

218
00:16:15.92 --> 00:16:16.92
Yeah.

219
00:16:16.92 --> 00:16:17.92
And so.

220
00:16:17.92 --> 00:16:18.92
That's like one classroom.

221
00:16:18.92 --> 00:16:19.92
Yeah.

222
00:16:19.92 --> 00:16:20.92
Yeah.

223
00:16:20.92 --> 00:16:23.52
We actually, the school was a middle school in high school together.

224
00:16:23.52 --> 00:16:24.96
It was just in a different hall.

225
00:16:24.96 --> 00:16:29.36
So high school took up like one hall and a half and the middle school took up like another

226
00:16:29.36 --> 00:16:30.76
hall and a half.

227
00:16:30.76 --> 00:16:34.20
And we didn't cross paths with the middle schoolers, but we were all in the same building.

228
00:16:34.20 --> 00:16:36.08
Now, were you guys in the same grade?

229
00:16:36.08 --> 00:16:37.28
Was he a freshman year freshman?

230
00:16:37.28 --> 00:16:39.44
No, he was just, he was a year older, sophomore.

231
00:16:39.44 --> 00:16:40.44
He was a sophomore.

232
00:16:40.44 --> 00:16:41.44
I was, yeah.

233
00:16:41.44 --> 00:16:47.44
And so then, like, what did he like say what's up, sister?

234
00:16:47.44 --> 00:16:48.44
I mean, what did he do?

235
00:16:48.44 --> 00:16:49.44
How do you roll?

236
00:16:49.44 --> 00:16:50.44
How did he just happen?

237
00:16:50.44 --> 00:16:51.44
He was pretty cool.

238
00:16:51.44 --> 00:16:54.28
I mean, I say there wasn't a cool group, but he was, I think he was pretty cool

239
00:16:54.28 --> 00:16:56.76
in high school and he was super athletic.

240
00:16:56.76 --> 00:17:01.32
And, I mean, for anybody who's listening, he's really good looking.

241
00:17:01.32 --> 00:17:04.24
So, you know, he had that going for him.

242
00:17:04.24 --> 00:17:07.60
We were just friends the first year or two.

243
00:17:07.60 --> 00:17:09.36
What sports did he play?

244
00:17:09.36 --> 00:17:12.04
Soccer, primarily.

245
00:17:12.04 --> 00:17:14.88
I think he was on the golf team one year.

246
00:17:14.88 --> 00:17:19.64
And I think he was the kicker for the football team one year because they just knew

247
00:17:19.64 --> 00:17:20.64
he could kick it.

248
00:17:20.64 --> 00:17:24.16
So he'd run out there, kick and then come off.

249
00:17:24.16 --> 00:17:27.24
But yeah, for two years, we were more or less just friends.

250
00:17:27.24 --> 00:17:32.80
I mean, in that period of time, he did ask me to go to homecoming.

251
00:17:32.80 --> 00:17:35.64
And I was super pumped about it.

252
00:17:35.64 --> 00:17:39.44
So homecoming is what?

253
00:17:39.44 --> 00:17:40.44
Like, yeah.

254
00:17:40.44 --> 00:17:42.40
The thing is, I went to a really small school too.

255
00:17:42.40 --> 00:17:44.36
I think I had 80 people in my graduating.

256
00:17:44.36 --> 00:17:45.92
I don't really remember the home.

257
00:17:45.92 --> 00:17:48.04
I know my, because I have kids too.

258
00:17:48.04 --> 00:17:49.88
And my daughters went to some kind of homecoming.

259
00:17:49.88 --> 00:17:51.48
But what's the deal with homecoming?

260
00:17:51.48 --> 00:17:53.40
I know the team came to my house.

261
00:17:53.40 --> 00:17:54.40
They were dressed up.

262
00:17:54.40 --> 00:17:56.16
The boys were wearing ties and like this tucking part.

263
00:17:56.16 --> 00:17:59.28
Yeah, it's basically a reason to get dressed up and have a party.

264
00:17:59.28 --> 00:18:02.24
And you know, back then it was big deal because it's a small school.

265
00:18:02.24 --> 00:18:04.08
And you have a huge pepper alley on Friday.

266
00:18:04.08 --> 00:18:05.08
And that was rally.

267
00:18:05.08 --> 00:18:06.08
Yeah.

268
00:18:06.08 --> 00:18:07.08
And we were pumped.

269
00:18:07.08 --> 00:18:09.80
I mean, my kids dread pepper alley is now they're like, that's lame.

270
00:18:09.80 --> 00:18:10.80
I'm not going.

271
00:18:10.80 --> 00:18:11.80
I'm like, why not?

272
00:18:11.80 --> 00:18:12.80
It's awesome.

273
00:18:12.80 --> 00:18:13.80
That's what we did.

274
00:18:13.80 --> 00:18:14.80
There was a football game.

275
00:18:14.80 --> 00:18:18.76
And then after the football game, you had a dance.

276
00:18:18.76 --> 00:18:19.76
And you get dressed up.

277
00:18:19.76 --> 00:18:23.36
And you got the like corsage and the flower and the whole thing.

278
00:18:23.36 --> 00:18:24.36
Yeah.

279
00:18:24.36 --> 00:18:26.32
It's a different time.

280
00:18:26.32 --> 00:18:31.64
You know, I was looking at a boot camp, a picture of myself the other day.

281
00:18:31.64 --> 00:18:35.20
And the picture was taken in 1990, right?

282
00:18:35.20 --> 00:18:39.16
So I posted, I was like, I posted on my social media page.

283
00:18:39.16 --> 00:18:40.16
Right?

284
00:18:40.16 --> 00:18:41.72
Hey, you know, here's a new boot camp.

285
00:18:41.72 --> 00:18:44.56
And I thought, so that's 1990.

286
00:18:44.56 --> 00:18:48.96
That's 31 years ago.

287
00:18:48.96 --> 00:18:53.08
That means when I was in boot camp, if I would have looked at a picture that was

288
00:18:53.08 --> 00:18:56.80
31 years old, it would have been from 1960.

289
00:18:56.80 --> 00:18:57.80
Yeah.

290
00:18:57.80 --> 00:18:58.80
Crazy.

291
00:18:58.80 --> 00:19:04.000
And then I have sometimes on the podcast, I'll have guys on that run, you know, World

292
00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:07.84
World 2 career Vietnam, but recently had a bunch of Vietnam guys on.

293
00:19:07.84 --> 00:19:10.48
And they're just like, they're talking about pepper rallies.

294
00:19:10.48 --> 00:19:11.48
Like these kind of things.

295
00:19:11.48 --> 00:19:13.08
It was just a different time.

296
00:19:13.08 --> 00:19:14.48
I think you caught the end of it.

297
00:19:14.48 --> 00:19:15.48
I caught the tail end of it.

298
00:19:15.48 --> 00:19:16.48
I think I did.

299
00:19:16.48 --> 00:19:20.24
I think I found like the sweet spot of high school before all that.

300
00:19:20.24 --> 00:19:23.96
I was blew up and diminished.

301
00:19:23.96 --> 00:19:24.96
I don't know.

302
00:19:24.96 --> 00:19:27.000
Okay, so you get started to sidetrack.

303
00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.16
I kind of needed to know about homecomings.

304
00:19:29.16 --> 00:19:32.56
Because my two daughters went to home, the homecoming thing.

305
00:19:32.56 --> 00:19:35.72
They got picked up by some dudes at the house.

306
00:19:35.72 --> 00:19:39.16
The guys were wearing ties and whatnot.

307
00:19:39.16 --> 00:19:40.40
I tracked it, no one.

308
00:19:40.40 --> 00:19:41.40
We're good.

309
00:19:44.40 --> 00:19:46.48
Okay, so you get asked the homecoming, my Chad?

310
00:19:46.48 --> 00:19:47.48
Yeah.

311
00:19:47.48 --> 00:19:52.96
And it was just the dance and then later.

312
00:19:52.96 --> 00:19:57.44
Well, so we asked me after we got in a food fight in the cafeteria.

313
00:19:57.44 --> 00:19:58.44
Where you got in a food fight?

314
00:19:58.44 --> 00:19:59.44
No, he got in a food fight.

315
00:19:59.44 --> 00:20:00.44
Okay.

316
00:20:00.44 --> 00:20:01.44
He's great.

317
00:20:01.44 --> 00:20:05.24
And he came up, he had food on a shirt and stuff.

318
00:20:05.24 --> 00:20:09.000
And then he's like, hey, as he would say, you want to go to homecoming with me?

319
00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.40
I tried to act not really excited, but I was like, all right.

320
00:20:12.40 --> 00:20:13.72
It was like, yes.

321
00:20:13.72 --> 00:20:14.72
Score.

322
00:20:14.72 --> 00:20:16.52
So yeah, and we just went homecoming.

323
00:20:16.52 --> 00:20:17.88
And then that was that.

324
00:20:17.88 --> 00:20:18.88
We didn't date or anything.

325
00:20:18.88 --> 00:20:22.76
And then fast forward to the following spring.

326
00:20:22.76 --> 00:20:29.28
One more thing about homecoming and dances in high school was their particular like songs

327
00:20:29.28 --> 00:20:31.64
that were repetitive.

328
00:20:31.64 --> 00:20:36.88
Because when I went to high school, every single dance that I went through, which started

329
00:20:36.88 --> 00:20:42.60
in mid-School, which was, I guess, it was 7th, so 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th grade.

330
00:20:42.60 --> 00:20:45.76
Every single dance that I went to.

331
00:20:45.76 --> 00:20:47.40
That's where we had dances, I don't know what they're called now.

332
00:20:47.40 --> 00:20:50.32
But every single dance we went to, every single one.

333
00:20:50.32 --> 00:20:54.48
So there's probably 4 or 5 a year, you know, 6 or 30 times.

334
00:20:54.48 --> 00:20:59.68
The song that would play at the end of the night was, was, stay where it had a Led Zeppelin.

335
00:20:59.68 --> 00:21:00.68
Oh, yeah.

336
00:21:00.68 --> 00:21:01.68
Is that a normal transition?

337
00:21:01.68 --> 00:21:03.08
Is that a worldwide tradition?

338
00:21:03.08 --> 00:21:05.68
I think it's just a really good march-out song.

339
00:21:05.68 --> 00:21:08.48
They're like, yeah, beat it.

340
00:21:08.48 --> 00:21:09.96
Lights are coming up.

341
00:21:09.96 --> 00:21:11.52
Mozy out the door.

342
00:21:11.52 --> 00:21:12.52
Right on.

343
00:21:12.52 --> 00:21:13.52
Right on.

344
00:21:13.52 --> 00:21:16.28
So you go to this dance and I cut you off.

345
00:21:16.28 --> 00:21:18.80
So you go to the dance and that was it.

346
00:21:18.80 --> 00:21:20.36
Nothing really became of it.

347
00:21:20.36 --> 00:21:25.04
But then fast forward a couple of months later, towards the end of the year, he would go

348
00:21:25.04 --> 00:21:26.04
by me in the locker.

349
00:21:26.04 --> 00:21:30.96
You know, I'd be see him in the locker and he'd walk by and he just, hey, the whole, hey.

350
00:21:30.96 --> 00:21:34.36
And I just, I kind of just did the whole girl flip out thing.

351
00:21:34.36 --> 00:21:37.28
Like, oh my god, he said, hey to me.

352
00:21:37.28 --> 00:21:39.88
And then he needed help with a history paper, apparently.

353
00:21:39.88 --> 00:21:40.88
They asked me to help.

354
00:21:40.88 --> 00:21:41.88
They asked me to help.

355
00:21:41.88 --> 00:21:42.88
Yeah.

356
00:21:42.88 --> 00:21:46.08
So I was like, okay, and then he asked me out to dinner.

357
00:21:46.08 --> 00:21:48.80
I went to dinner and we started dating pretty much.

358
00:21:48.80 --> 00:21:49.52
So that was-

359
00:21:49.52 --> 00:21:50.52
Where'd you go to dinner?

360
00:21:50.52 --> 00:21:51.80
We went to this Mexican restaurant.

361
00:21:51.80 --> 00:21:53.36
I don't think it even exists anymore.

362
00:21:53.36 --> 00:21:54.36
I don't know the name of it.

363
00:21:54.36 --> 00:21:55.36
And a quiet harbor.

364
00:21:55.36 --> 00:21:56.68
We'll shout out.

365
00:21:56.68 --> 00:22:01.72
I don't know if I actually asked a girl to dinner until I was in my twigs.

366
00:22:01.72 --> 00:22:04.92
Who are you at class?

367
00:22:04.92 --> 00:22:07.28
Well, I don't even know if I should share all this.

368
00:22:07.28 --> 00:22:09.68
But we actually also went to a movie.

369
00:22:09.68 --> 00:22:13.80
And we bought tickets to some stupid movie because we couldn't get in a radar movie.

370
00:22:13.80 --> 00:22:17.24
And then we snuck into the movie, sliver.

371
00:22:17.24 --> 00:22:18.80
Do you guys remember that movie?

372
00:22:18.80 --> 00:22:19.80
Harbor movie?

373
00:22:19.80 --> 00:22:20.80
It's like sexy smutnik.

374
00:22:20.80 --> 00:22:21.80
Oh, oh.

375
00:22:21.80 --> 00:22:26.80
And I'm like, on this date, now I was like, oh, there's a lot of artists sharing stone.

376
00:22:26.80 --> 00:22:28.80
I, oh, I think so.

377
00:22:28.80 --> 00:22:30.52
I actually don't remember who was in it.

378
00:22:30.52 --> 00:22:35.44
I mean, this was a long long time ago, but I just remember being like completely red.

379
00:22:35.44 --> 00:22:37.44
Thankfully, in a dark movie theater.

380
00:22:37.44 --> 00:22:38.44
And Marist.

381
00:22:38.44 --> 00:22:39.44
Yeah, but we did.

382
00:22:39.44 --> 00:22:41.88
But dinner and snuck in a red at our movie.

383
00:22:41.88 --> 00:22:42.88
Crazy.

384
00:22:42.88 --> 00:22:43.88
Crazy kid.

385
00:22:43.88 --> 00:22:44.88
Kids were getting crazy.

386
00:22:44.88 --> 00:22:45.88
I know.

387
00:22:45.88 --> 00:22:46.88
That's what you was at.

388
00:22:46.88 --> 00:22:48.60
Was this one his senior year?

389
00:22:48.60 --> 00:22:51.40
I was, it was the end of my sophomore year.

390
00:22:51.40 --> 00:22:52.68
His junior year.

391
00:22:52.68 --> 00:22:53.68
Okay.

392
00:22:53.68 --> 00:22:54.68
And so this was 1993.

393
00:22:54.68 --> 00:22:55.68
Okay.

394
00:22:55.68 --> 00:22:57.08
Really started dating.

395
00:22:57.08 --> 00:22:58.48
So now you're legit dating.

396
00:22:58.48 --> 00:22:59.48
Yeah.

397
00:22:59.48 --> 00:23:01.48
Through the summer?

398
00:23:01.48 --> 00:23:03.12
Well, so then I was coming in the fall.

399
00:23:03.12 --> 00:23:04.12
Yeah.

400
00:23:04.12 --> 00:23:05.12
Well, then it was for us.

401
00:23:05.12 --> 00:23:06.12
I don't know if it changes.

402
00:23:06.12 --> 00:23:08.36
But it was like October.

403
00:23:08.36 --> 00:23:10.72
I have a really great picture from that day.

404
00:23:10.72 --> 00:23:12.92
I should pass it to you just because it's good.

405
00:23:12.92 --> 00:23:18.12
But no, my dad got stationed in Lajoon.

406
00:23:18.12 --> 00:23:20.56
So I had to leave after my sophomore year.

407
00:23:20.56 --> 00:23:21.56
Yeah.

408
00:23:21.56 --> 00:23:25.76
And that was the only time I was ever really pissed, honestly.

409
00:23:25.76 --> 00:23:27.60
Every move I'd be like, okay.

410
00:23:27.60 --> 00:23:28.96
We didn't get family vacations.

411
00:23:28.96 --> 00:23:29.96
We moved.

412
00:23:29.96 --> 00:23:30.96
That's what happened.

413
00:23:30.96 --> 00:23:32.16
And then you're on a new adventure.

414
00:23:32.16 --> 00:23:33.72
And this was the only time I was mad.

415
00:23:33.72 --> 00:23:34.72
And so.

416
00:23:34.72 --> 00:23:35.72
What were you into for?

417
00:23:35.72 --> 00:23:36.92
Were you doing sports as well?

418
00:23:36.92 --> 00:23:37.92
I was.

419
00:23:37.92 --> 00:23:38.92
I was a swimmer.

420
00:23:38.92 --> 00:23:39.92
I was a swimmer.

421
00:23:39.92 --> 00:23:40.92
Cool.

422
00:23:40.92 --> 00:23:41.92
Yeah.

423
00:23:41.92 --> 00:23:42.92
So I was that person and it's like, you wake up at five.

424
00:23:42.92 --> 00:23:43.92
You swim.

425
00:23:43.92 --> 00:23:44.92
You go to school.

426
00:23:44.92 --> 00:23:45.92
You swim.

427
00:23:45.92 --> 00:23:46.92
You swim a lot.

428
00:23:46.92 --> 00:23:47.92
Yeah.

429
00:23:47.92 --> 00:23:48.92
Okay.

430
00:23:48.92 --> 00:23:49.92
So now you have to go to Camp Lajoon.

431
00:23:49.92 --> 00:23:50.92
Yeah.

432
00:23:50.92 --> 00:23:53.76
So I managed to work a deal.

433
00:23:53.76 --> 00:23:56.92
And I stayed at my best friends house.

434
00:23:56.92 --> 00:23:58.76
Steph cutty.

435
00:23:58.76 --> 00:23:59.76
So I could hang out with her.

436
00:23:59.76 --> 00:24:02.04
But really, so I could hang out with Chad.

437
00:24:02.04 --> 00:24:03.04
Let's be honest.

438
00:24:03.04 --> 00:24:04.04
I want to already.

439
00:24:04.04 --> 00:24:07.80
And yeah, I just hung out that summer as a lifeguard.

440
00:24:07.80 --> 00:24:10.72
I got the pool on base through high school as a lifeguard.

441
00:24:10.72 --> 00:24:12.72
And I pulled butts at the shooting range.

442
00:24:12.72 --> 00:24:13.72
Dang.

443
00:24:13.72 --> 00:24:14.72
You know, like, rolling up.

444
00:24:14.72 --> 00:24:18.96
And we, all the high school kids, we just sit there like in this little dugout with

445
00:24:18.96 --> 00:24:25.52
your pro on and you'd see the bullet go and you pull the target, slap the sticker on it,

446
00:24:25.52 --> 00:24:26.52
throw it back up.

447
00:24:26.52 --> 00:24:27.52
It's how we spent our weekends.

448
00:24:27.52 --> 00:24:28.52
Minimum wage?

449
00:24:28.52 --> 00:24:29.52
Oh, yeah.

450
00:24:29.52 --> 00:24:30.52
I was barely making anything.

451
00:24:30.52 --> 00:24:32.52
Well, I mean, I was actually in the Navy.

452
00:24:32.52 --> 00:24:33.52
And I did that.

453
00:24:33.52 --> 00:24:34.52
But I did have for each other.

454
00:24:34.52 --> 00:24:35.52
That's what we did.

455
00:24:35.52 --> 00:24:37.52
Well, I have.

456
00:24:37.52 --> 00:24:39.68
So people to come down and do it for us.

457
00:24:39.68 --> 00:24:41.24
I guess that's some wrinkle or officer thing.

458
00:24:41.24 --> 00:24:43.84
Well, our friends dad pretty much ran the rain.

459
00:24:43.84 --> 00:24:46.28
So I think he just like, I'm going to make these kids do something.

460
00:24:46.28 --> 00:24:49.04
And so we could hang out with our friends all day on the weekend.

461
00:24:49.04 --> 00:24:50.88
It makes me sound like such a nerd.

462
00:24:50.88 --> 00:24:51.72
Not that I'm saying this.

463
00:24:51.72 --> 00:24:53.72
I didn't do anything like super crazy in high school.

464
00:24:53.72 --> 00:24:57.76
But we could hang out with our friends and get paid a little bit of money.

465
00:24:57.76 --> 00:24:58.76
Okay.

466
00:24:58.76 --> 00:25:01.28
So that's where you spend the summer and this whole time you're hanging out with Chad.

467
00:25:01.28 --> 00:25:05.16
So you guys are a tight, getting tight at this time or a thing.

468
00:25:05.16 --> 00:25:06.36
But you're going to bail.

469
00:25:06.36 --> 00:25:07.36
Yeah.

470
00:25:07.36 --> 00:25:08.36
I'm just ticking.

471
00:25:08.36 --> 00:25:10.60
And yep, so I moved to Lajoon.

472
00:25:10.60 --> 00:25:12.40
We continued dating.

473
00:25:12.40 --> 00:25:13.40
I'm a junior.

474
00:25:13.40 --> 00:25:15.08
He's a senior.

475
00:25:15.08 --> 00:25:17.92
And he would drive down on the weekends.

476
00:25:17.92 --> 00:25:22.32
Which was kind of a big deal because you know, he was fairly newly licensed, you know,

477
00:25:22.32 --> 00:25:24.72
and his mom and dad would let him drive.

478
00:25:24.72 --> 00:25:26.48
The minivan or what was he driving?

479
00:25:26.48 --> 00:25:29.08
No, he had an old oldsmoble.

480
00:25:29.08 --> 00:25:31.60
I think at my time, it belonged to his grandpa.

481
00:25:31.60 --> 00:25:34.08
And like the front seat was busted.

482
00:25:34.08 --> 00:25:36.40
So it like sat crooked.

483
00:25:36.40 --> 00:25:37.40
And he was a hoopty.

484
00:25:37.40 --> 00:25:38.64
It was great.

485
00:25:38.64 --> 00:25:42.88
And he would drive that down on the weekends and see me and then drive back.

486
00:25:42.88 --> 00:25:45.24
Not every weekend, but as much as he could.

487
00:25:45.24 --> 00:25:46.24
Stay the night.

488
00:25:46.24 --> 00:25:47.24
Mm-hmm.

489
00:25:47.24 --> 00:25:48.24
Parents were cool.

490
00:25:48.24 --> 00:25:49.24
Yeah.

491
00:25:49.24 --> 00:25:53.92
This was like a thing because my parents, my mom said to me recently, like in the last year,

492
00:25:53.92 --> 00:25:57.40
we had some conversations just about this, Chad and I are youth.

493
00:25:57.40 --> 00:25:59.40
And she said, I don't know what it was.

494
00:25:59.40 --> 00:26:05.24
I just, we just always knew that the relationship with you and Chad was just something

495
00:26:05.24 --> 00:26:06.24
different.

496
00:26:06.24 --> 00:26:07.24
And he stayed.

497
00:26:07.24 --> 00:26:09.08
I mean, he stayed in the separate room.

498
00:26:09.08 --> 00:26:10.80
He wasn't my room, but yeah.

499
00:26:10.80 --> 00:26:13.24
Well, at least as far as the birds know.

500
00:26:13.24 --> 00:26:14.24
I mean, yeah.

501
00:26:14.24 --> 00:26:19.24
He was getting tactical.

502
00:26:19.24 --> 00:26:21.24
I'm sure at some point.

503
00:26:21.24 --> 00:26:22.24
I am.

504
00:26:22.24 --> 00:26:24.24
You're playing the fair thing.

505
00:26:24.24 --> 00:26:26.24
Cool.

506
00:26:26.24 --> 00:26:30.24
So then how long does this long distance relationship work?

507
00:26:30.24 --> 00:26:35.92
So we, and so we date and then when I, so he graduates, an homiceneer.

508
00:26:35.92 --> 00:26:37.08
So I'm a senior.

509
00:26:37.08 --> 00:26:38.60
He graduates high school.

510
00:26:38.60 --> 00:26:43.52
His mom and dad moved to Florida to Orlando now.

511
00:26:43.52 --> 00:26:45.64
When he's in high school, is he talking about joining the Navy?

512
00:26:45.64 --> 00:26:47.44
Has he talked about going in the dreams?

513
00:26:47.44 --> 00:26:52.56
He always kind of, I think he just always knew that's what he was going to do.

514
00:26:52.56 --> 00:26:54.20
It wasn't that he talked about it in excess.

515
00:26:54.20 --> 00:26:55.52
So he has two brothers.

516
00:26:55.52 --> 00:26:56.72
He's the oldest.

517
00:26:56.72 --> 00:26:58.88
Two brothers in the necister.

518
00:26:58.88 --> 00:27:05.88
And his house was just full of, you know, every classic, seal movie.

519
00:27:05.88 --> 00:27:12.80
You know, speck up movie, you know, he had posters on his wall, which I think I still

520
00:27:12.80 --> 00:27:15.44
have that you probably can't even find anywhere anymore.

521
00:27:15.44 --> 00:27:19.88
But I think it was just something he always knew that's what he was going to do.

522
00:27:19.88 --> 00:27:22.44
I don't ever remember him talking about anything else.

523
00:27:22.44 --> 00:27:26.12
Like, oh, I might go to business school or something.

524
00:27:26.12 --> 00:27:27.12
No.

525
00:27:27.12 --> 00:27:31.76
It was so obvious to him and you that it was not even really a big subject.

526
00:27:31.76 --> 00:27:33.64
It was like, yeah, well, what else am I going to do?

527
00:27:33.64 --> 00:27:34.64
That type of thing?

528
00:27:34.64 --> 00:27:35.64
Yeah.

529
00:27:35.64 --> 00:27:41.28
And I mean, even then, I don't think at my age, I was even thinking about, you know,

530
00:27:41.28 --> 00:27:42.28
our life together.

531
00:27:42.28 --> 00:27:44.36
Like, oh, I'm going to marry him.

532
00:27:44.36 --> 00:27:47.52
I doodle this name a lot on all my notebooks because that's what you do.

533
00:27:47.52 --> 00:27:50.96
And I am his, your grunge t-shirt and your boy crush.

534
00:27:50.96 --> 00:27:56.56
But I just always thought, I'm just going to be wherever he is.

535
00:27:56.56 --> 00:28:01.16
You know, I wasn't thinking like marriage, but I just knew whatever he is is where I want

536
00:28:01.16 --> 00:28:02.16
to be.

537
00:28:02.16 --> 00:28:03.16
Right on.

538
00:28:03.16 --> 00:28:04.80
So what happens?

539
00:28:04.80 --> 00:28:05.80
Oh, we break up.

540
00:28:05.80 --> 00:28:06.80
So that kind of.

541
00:28:06.80 --> 00:28:07.80
Yeah.

542
00:28:07.80 --> 00:28:08.80
So we broke up.

543
00:28:08.80 --> 00:28:09.80
Oh, this is your senior year.

544
00:28:09.80 --> 00:28:10.80
My senior year.

545
00:28:10.80 --> 00:28:11.80
So he's going.

546
00:28:11.80 --> 00:28:13.96
Yeah, so he moved down to Florida.

547
00:28:13.96 --> 00:28:18.60
And so the deal was, is he wanted to be an officer.

548
00:28:18.60 --> 00:28:23.64
And at that time, so he enrolled in the University of Central Florida.

549
00:28:23.64 --> 00:28:25.20
His mom and dad are in Orlando.

550
00:28:25.20 --> 00:28:26.68
He's down there with them.

551
00:28:26.68 --> 00:28:28.20
He's thinking, I'm going to go to college.

552
00:28:28.20 --> 00:28:32.22
I'm going to get a four year degree and then I'm going to go do the whole Navy, Buds

553
00:28:32.22 --> 00:28:33.22
Deal.

554
00:28:33.22 --> 00:28:37.34
But they were saying, hey, we're not really taking officers right now because we just

555
00:28:37.34 --> 00:28:38.34
don't need them.

556
00:28:38.34 --> 00:28:42.46
So you can go get your degree, but it's not that's not going to work out.

557
00:28:42.46 --> 00:28:51.86
And so basically a year in college, he said, OK, I'm out and joined.

558
00:28:51.86 --> 00:28:55.02
So we broke up my senior year.

559
00:28:55.02 --> 00:28:58.58
Did you break up before or after he joined the Navy before?

560
00:28:58.58 --> 00:29:01.02
So before he's in Orlando, I'm in Luzune.

561
00:29:01.02 --> 00:29:02.02
We break up.

562
00:29:02.02 --> 00:29:07.50
Really, just because I think you got friends are like, why are you dating some boy that

563
00:29:07.50 --> 00:29:08.82
looks so far away?

564
00:29:08.82 --> 00:29:10.46
That's stupid.

565
00:29:10.46 --> 00:29:11.46
All the things.

566
00:29:11.46 --> 00:29:13.26
So we broke up.

567
00:29:13.26 --> 00:29:19.94
And we spent two and a half years pretty much went by in that time.

568
00:29:19.94 --> 00:29:24.42
The time he was in college and my senior year.

569
00:29:24.42 --> 00:29:30.46
And then my first year after graduating high school, we just didn't really speak to each

570
00:29:30.46 --> 00:29:31.46
other.

571
00:29:31.46 --> 00:29:35.34
And this was before cell phones or social media.

572
00:29:35.34 --> 00:29:39.74
You can't properly cyber stalk somebody back in the day.

573
00:29:39.74 --> 00:29:40.74
Right.

574
00:29:40.74 --> 00:29:43.42
And I would stay in touch with his sister, his little sister.

575
00:29:43.42 --> 00:29:46.38
So she's 10 years younger than him.

576
00:29:46.38 --> 00:29:47.38
She was pretty young.

577
00:29:47.38 --> 00:29:48.38
I mean, I don't know when she was five.

578
00:29:48.38 --> 00:29:50.38
So she's pretty young.

579
00:29:50.38 --> 00:29:51.38
But.

580
00:29:51.38 --> 00:29:53.50
And so I always kind of knew what he was doing.

581
00:29:53.50 --> 00:29:57.66
And I knew he joined the Navy and you know, went to boot camp and was going to buds.

582
00:29:57.66 --> 00:30:03.98
And I really wanted to be there for his graduation of buds.

583
00:30:03.98 --> 00:30:08.90
But I thought that might be weird if I just show up.

584
00:30:08.90 --> 00:30:10.78
Plus I'd never been a California, the whole thing.

585
00:30:10.78 --> 00:30:11.78
I'm living.

586
00:30:11.78 --> 00:30:13.18
I'm going to confirm that would be weird.

587
00:30:13.18 --> 00:30:14.18
Yeah.

588
00:30:14.18 --> 00:30:15.18
Yeah.

589
00:30:15.18 --> 00:30:19.38
And so during this time, you know, he goes to college, joins the military.

590
00:30:19.38 --> 00:30:20.38
I finish high school.

591
00:30:20.38 --> 00:30:24.78
My family moves to Tampa because my dad is at St. Com.

592
00:30:24.78 --> 00:30:28.10
So his family is Orlando, my family is in Tampa.

593
00:30:28.10 --> 00:30:31.02
I'm going to community college.

594
00:30:31.02 --> 00:30:33.50
And I think I want to be there for his buds graduation.

595
00:30:33.50 --> 00:30:34.50
But I can't do that.

596
00:30:34.50 --> 00:30:37.18
So I need to put myself in a position that doesn't allow me to do that.

597
00:30:37.18 --> 00:30:38.94
So I went on a cruise.

598
00:30:38.94 --> 00:30:42.18
And I thought if I'm on a boat, I can't get off the boat.

599
00:30:42.18 --> 00:30:44.46
And I'm like 19 or something.

600
00:30:44.46 --> 00:30:46.82
And we doted and we doted in New Orleans.

601
00:30:46.82 --> 00:30:49.82
And I told my girlfriend, I was like, I'm getting off the boat.

602
00:30:49.82 --> 00:30:50.82
I'm going to go get on a plane.

603
00:30:50.82 --> 00:30:52.42
And I'm just going to show up there.

604
00:30:52.42 --> 00:30:53.42
And she's like, OK.

605
00:30:53.42 --> 00:30:56.02
And I realize it didn't have any money to get there.

606
00:30:56.02 --> 00:30:57.54
I'd spend it all in the cruise.

607
00:30:57.54 --> 00:31:00.02
And were you, but you hadn't been communicating with him?

608
00:31:00.02 --> 00:31:01.14
No, during this time period.

609
00:31:01.14 --> 00:31:03.06
No, just keep an in touch with a sister.

610
00:31:03.06 --> 00:31:05.86
And like his mom would check in from time to time.

611
00:31:05.86 --> 00:31:07.50
And his mom still liked you.

612
00:31:07.50 --> 00:31:09.14
Yeah, I hope.

613
00:31:09.14 --> 00:31:10.14
You know?

614
00:31:10.14 --> 00:31:11.18
So yeah.

615
00:31:11.18 --> 00:31:13.14
So then he graduates buds.

616
00:31:13.14 --> 00:31:14.42
So he graduates buds.

617
00:31:14.42 --> 00:31:15.58
And now what happens?

618
00:31:15.58 --> 00:31:18.02
Well, I knew he graduated buds.

619
00:31:18.02 --> 00:31:20.78
And then I also knew he was coming back to Orlando.

620
00:31:20.78 --> 00:31:25.94
So I took a couple days off work and just waited.

621
00:31:25.94 --> 00:31:28.90
And then he called and said, hey, I'd really like to see you.

622
00:31:28.90 --> 00:31:31.82
And I was like, oh, that's cool.

623
00:31:31.82 --> 00:31:34.02
Let me see if I can get off work.

624
00:31:34.02 --> 00:31:35.42
You know, you got to play tough.

625
00:31:35.42 --> 00:31:39.66
And yeah, I didn't drove there.

626
00:31:39.66 --> 00:31:41.38
Was super nervous.

627
00:31:41.38 --> 00:31:43.78
His brother, I think, opened the door.

628
00:31:43.78 --> 00:31:46.30
He was wrestling his other brother in the background,

629
00:31:46.30 --> 00:31:47.62
probably trying to play it cool.

630
00:31:47.62 --> 00:31:50.30
And pretty much the same thing as that day on the bleachers.

631
00:31:50.30 --> 00:31:54.54
And now as soon as I saw him, I was like, man.

632
00:31:54.54 --> 00:31:58.14
So he had graduated buds at that point.

633
00:31:58.14 --> 00:32:00.82
So now he must be on orders got orders to a team.

634
00:32:00.82 --> 00:32:01.82
Yeah.

635
00:32:01.82 --> 00:32:03.98
So he had to go.

636
00:32:03.98 --> 00:32:07.34
This is when they were had specific rates.

637
00:32:07.34 --> 00:32:08.78
Your time for him, probably too.

638
00:32:08.78 --> 00:32:10.82
So he went to the medics school.

639
00:32:10.82 --> 00:32:11.82
Oh, so yeah.

640
00:32:11.82 --> 00:32:14.66
So actually, so he what he got was he must have been a corpsman.

641
00:32:14.66 --> 00:32:16.94
And then they would take corpsman and after buds,

642
00:32:16.94 --> 00:32:20.54
they would take corpsman and send him to 18 delta,

643
00:32:20.54 --> 00:32:23.62
the special forces medics school.

644
00:32:23.62 --> 00:32:24.98
What's interesting about that?

645
00:32:24.98 --> 00:32:26.94
And I might mess this up a little bit.

646
00:32:26.94 --> 00:32:31.38
But his dad then had orders to Fort Bragg

647
00:32:31.38 --> 00:32:33.82
and his dad ran that school.

648
00:32:33.82 --> 00:32:37.70
So he went through the school that his dad was running.

649
00:32:37.70 --> 00:32:38.46
That's interesting.

650
00:32:38.46 --> 00:32:39.70
That's awesome.

651
00:32:39.70 --> 00:32:41.30
I guess he got some good grades.

652
00:32:41.30 --> 00:32:41.98
Hopefully.

653
00:32:41.98 --> 00:32:42.98
Yeah.

654
00:32:42.98 --> 00:32:43.82
He's a smart guy.

655
00:32:43.82 --> 00:32:45.58
It's good in school.

656
00:32:45.58 --> 00:32:47.62
So so so then what happens?

657
00:32:47.62 --> 00:32:49.14
So then he's going to that school.

658
00:32:49.14 --> 00:32:50.50
Now are you two back together?

659
00:32:50.50 --> 00:32:51.98
Is this like we're back?

660
00:32:51.98 --> 00:32:52.82
We're back.

661
00:32:52.82 --> 00:32:53.46
Yeah.

662
00:32:53.46 --> 00:32:54.66
So we're back together.

663
00:32:54.66 --> 00:32:57.58
And this is I had 96.

664
00:32:57.58 --> 00:33:00.74
And so I decide because I want to be wherever he is,

665
00:33:00.74 --> 00:33:02.98
I'm going to go to college at Methodist,

666
00:33:02.98 --> 00:33:05.34
which is a really small school in Fayville.

667
00:33:05.34 --> 00:33:07.02
So I go up there for semester.

668
00:33:07.02 --> 00:33:09.38
I had to do a whole presentation of my dad,

669
00:33:09.38 --> 00:33:11.42
my dad, right, Colonel Marine Corps.

670
00:33:11.42 --> 00:33:12.66
He always says when you want to do something

671
00:33:12.66 --> 00:33:14.34
you've got every ducks lined up and come to me.

672
00:33:14.34 --> 00:33:17.42
And I did like a report and figured out how much it was cost.

673
00:33:17.42 --> 00:33:18.62
I got scholarships.

674
00:33:18.62 --> 00:33:20.06
I got different things.

675
00:33:20.06 --> 00:33:22.22
How much it would be paid for?

676
00:33:22.22 --> 00:33:26.34
Really because I just wanted to be closer to Chad.

677
00:33:26.34 --> 00:33:28.42
Was that part of the briefing or not?

678
00:33:28.42 --> 00:33:30.70
I think he probably understood that.

679
00:33:30.70 --> 00:33:32.54
But I lasted one semester.

680
00:33:32.54 --> 00:33:33.26
I hated it.

681
00:33:33.26 --> 00:33:33.94
And I left.

682
00:33:33.94 --> 00:33:35.10
I went back to Florida.

683
00:33:35.10 --> 00:33:36.42
So he did the medical school.

684
00:33:36.42 --> 00:33:38.54
And then he was off to Silti Mait.

685
00:33:38.54 --> 00:33:38.98
And then what?

686
00:33:38.98 --> 00:33:40.18
Once he got to Silti Mait,

687
00:33:40.18 --> 00:33:41.94
did you guys reconnect again?

688
00:33:41.94 --> 00:33:46.02
Well, so we are dating long distance now.

689
00:33:46.02 --> 00:33:49.70
He's at teammate down in Florida.

690
00:33:49.70 --> 00:33:52.74
And then I end up going to the University of Florida.

691
00:33:52.74 --> 00:33:56.06
And we're thinking, OK, I'm going to do college down here.

692
00:33:56.06 --> 00:33:56.86
You're going to do that.

693
00:33:56.86 --> 00:33:58.98
And then we break up again.

694
00:33:58.98 --> 00:33:59.70
Yeah.

695
00:33:59.70 --> 00:34:02.10
So two pretty big breakups.

696
00:34:02.10 --> 00:34:07.58
It's hard to check into a team and have a girlfriend,

697
00:34:07.58 --> 00:34:10.14
or whatever, no offense to girlfriends of the world.

698
00:34:10.14 --> 00:34:12.98
You get to a team that is like you are going down.

699
00:34:12.98 --> 00:34:15.90
You are a, when you're a young new team guy,

700
00:34:15.90 --> 00:34:19.14
you have so much on your mind as far as work goes,

701
00:34:19.14 --> 00:34:23.26
it's like, hey, I don't have time for anything else right now.

702
00:34:23.26 --> 00:34:24.26
And I don't know.

703
00:34:24.26 --> 00:34:27.54
That's probably has at least a little something to do with it.

704
00:34:27.54 --> 00:34:28.46
You're down in Florida.

705
00:34:28.46 --> 00:34:30.02
He's up there, like, wanting to make sure he's

706
00:34:30.02 --> 00:34:30.66
good to go for this.

707
00:34:30.66 --> 00:34:31.82
And that.

708
00:34:31.82 --> 00:34:32.34
Yeah.

709
00:34:32.34 --> 00:34:35.26
Just had, I mean, he would drive down still on the weekends.

710
00:34:35.26 --> 00:34:35.98
Oh, we're still dating.

711
00:34:35.98 --> 00:34:36.82
We're still dating.

712
00:34:36.82 --> 00:34:37.66
Yeah.

713
00:34:37.66 --> 00:34:38.30
Like that gets full credit.

714
00:34:38.30 --> 00:34:38.66
Yeah.

715
00:34:38.66 --> 00:34:41.46
And, um, but yeah, we broke up.

716
00:34:41.46 --> 00:34:46.34
And that was just terrible because I really thought

717
00:34:46.34 --> 00:34:47.54
that that was probably it.

718
00:34:47.54 --> 00:34:51.18
I thought I probably lost him forever.

719
00:34:51.18 --> 00:34:54.46
And then how long are you guys broken up for?

720
00:34:54.46 --> 00:34:56.34
Ah, trying to think of the timeline.

721
00:34:56.34 --> 00:35:00.02
I was probably like a year, year and a half.

722
00:35:00.02 --> 00:35:00.86
Something like that.

723
00:35:00.86 --> 00:35:02.86
Did he do, did he do his first deployment?

724
00:35:02.86 --> 00:35:03.22
Yeah.

725
00:35:03.22 --> 00:35:06.10
He did a deployment of his on the enterprise.

726
00:35:06.10 --> 00:35:07.10
He was on a ship.

727
00:35:07.10 --> 00:35:08.98
Only a time he was on a ship at that time.

728
00:35:08.98 --> 00:35:11.54
And what you was that?

729
00:35:11.54 --> 00:35:16.66
Um, probably 97 or 8.

730
00:35:16.66 --> 00:35:17.18
Okay.

731
00:35:17.18 --> 00:35:18.34
Somewhere in that.

732
00:35:18.34 --> 00:35:19.18
Right on.

733
00:35:19.18 --> 00:35:20.18
Yeah.

734
00:35:20.18 --> 00:35:22.34
So he's, he does a deployment.

735
00:35:22.34 --> 00:35:23.34
He's a medic.

736
00:35:23.34 --> 00:35:24.34
Yep.

737
00:35:24.34 --> 00:35:25.34
You guys are broken up.

738
00:35:25.34 --> 00:35:28.34
You're going to, you're going to college in Florida.

739
00:35:28.34 --> 00:35:29.34
Yeah.

740
00:35:29.34 --> 00:35:32.78
And I'm still hearing in touch with his sister.

741
00:35:32.78 --> 00:35:36.30
And we had, you know, we had email.

742
00:35:36.30 --> 00:35:38.90
So, you know, like the dial-up.

743
00:35:38.90 --> 00:35:43.34
I would do the dial-up email and check to see if you'd ever email me.

744
00:35:43.34 --> 00:35:45.34
And then all of a sudden one day he did.

745
00:35:45.34 --> 00:35:49.18
And he just said, I just, I told the guys, I keep thinking about you.

746
00:35:49.18 --> 00:35:50.70
And I want to see you.

747
00:35:50.70 --> 00:35:52.94
I was like, yes.

748
00:35:52.94 --> 00:35:53.94
So.

749
00:35:53.94 --> 00:35:55.94
So did he say come up to Virginia Beach and he comes down to Florida?

750
00:35:55.94 --> 00:35:56.94
No.

751
00:35:56.94 --> 00:35:59.34
I said, you know where I live?

752
00:35:59.34 --> 00:36:00.94
Well, first of all, he was still in deployment.

753
00:36:00.94 --> 00:36:02.18
He was quite home yet.

754
00:36:02.18 --> 00:36:03.18
And so I didn't know.

755
00:36:03.18 --> 00:36:04.02
And I'm in college.

756
00:36:04.02 --> 00:36:09.06
And yeah, he drove down and showed up at my doorstep.

757
00:36:09.06 --> 00:36:11.82
And I did the same thing.

758
00:36:11.82 --> 00:36:12.82
I did in high school.

759
00:36:12.82 --> 00:36:16.90
I just couldn't believe he was there, you know?

760
00:36:16.90 --> 00:36:19.74
And just excited.

761
00:36:19.74 --> 00:36:24.02
And we said to each other, I said to him before he comes, came down.

762
00:36:24.02 --> 00:36:26.78
If we see each other again, we're going to know.

763
00:36:26.78 --> 00:36:30.94
Like this is either going to be forever or it's just not.

764
00:36:30.94 --> 00:36:32.70
And he came down.

765
00:36:32.70 --> 00:36:36.06
And pretty much roll over herself when I went to Orlando and he asked me to stay

766
00:36:36.06 --> 00:36:37.22
in extra day.

767
00:36:37.22 --> 00:36:40.46
I said, do you think you could stay in extra day?

768
00:36:40.46 --> 00:36:41.46
And that was it.

769
00:36:41.46 --> 00:36:49.22
So that was the summer of 99, I think.

770
00:36:49.22 --> 00:36:50.38
May of 99.

771
00:36:50.38 --> 00:36:51.94
How old are you at this point?

772
00:36:51.94 --> 00:36:53.74
You're going to make me do bath.

773
00:36:53.74 --> 00:36:54.74
I don't know.

774
00:36:54.74 --> 00:36:55.74
I'm like, 29.

775
00:36:55.74 --> 00:36:57.18
So you're, oh yeah, you're in college.

776
00:36:57.18 --> 00:37:00.18
You're a young college girl.

777
00:37:00.18 --> 00:37:03.38
And he's swoops in.

778
00:37:03.38 --> 00:37:04.54
Yeah.

779
00:37:04.54 --> 00:37:07.14
And says, all right, we're going to do this.

780
00:37:07.14 --> 00:37:09.66
Yeah, I mean, did you drop out of college?

781
00:37:09.66 --> 00:37:10.26
So what'd you do?

782
00:37:10.26 --> 00:37:12.18
No, I stayed in college.

783
00:37:12.18 --> 00:37:13.98
You're slightly more responsible than that.

784
00:37:13.98 --> 00:37:14.98
Yeah, stayed in college.

785
00:37:18.26 --> 00:37:21.78
We, we got engaged that summer in July.

786
00:37:21.78 --> 00:37:26.86
We got married on paper as a lot of military people do.

787
00:37:26.86 --> 00:37:29.02
We've got married up in Virginia Beach

788
00:37:29.02 --> 00:37:31.54
in the, in the sky's backyard.

789
00:37:31.54 --> 00:37:35.46
And so we were at least married and had all that.

790
00:37:35.46 --> 00:37:39.34
And I spent time down in Florida.

791
00:37:39.34 --> 00:37:41.02
And then I worked it to graduate.

792
00:37:41.02 --> 00:37:44.98
I had to do an internship to finish my degree.

793
00:37:44.98 --> 00:37:48.98
So I got an internship with the city of Virginia Beach

794
00:37:48.98 --> 00:37:50.86
because I wanted to be where he was.

795
00:37:50.86 --> 00:37:53.66
So you guys, you, you get married.

796
00:37:53.66 --> 00:37:55.58
Well, he proposes to you.

797
00:37:55.58 --> 00:37:59.18
And then you get married the old school like what I did.

798
00:37:59.18 --> 00:38:01.18
My wife and I got married at the San Diego

799
00:38:01.18 --> 00:38:03.14
courthouse and my chief was like the wet

800
00:38:03.14 --> 00:38:04.58
because you have to bring a witness.

801
00:38:04.58 --> 00:38:07.18
So I was like, hey, can you come with witness

802
00:38:07.18 --> 00:38:08.02
my wedding?

803
00:38:08.02 --> 00:38:09.14
He's like, you're getting married?

804
00:38:09.14 --> 00:38:09.98
Yeah.

805
00:38:09.98 --> 00:38:11.22
OK, so we went down there.

806
00:38:11.22 --> 00:38:14.22
And this judge goes, all right, you two are married.

807
00:38:14.22 --> 00:38:16.02
And then we walked out and then we went to

808
00:38:16.02 --> 00:38:17.62
Danes and had a hamburger.

809
00:38:17.62 --> 00:38:19.06
That was the honeymoon.

810
00:38:19.06 --> 00:38:22.14
Oh, bad husband.

811
00:38:22.14 --> 00:38:22.94
But that's what we did.

812
00:38:22.94 --> 00:38:24.62
That's sort of, that's what you guys did, too.

813
00:38:24.62 --> 00:38:27.86
I mean, I think for me, that's a better story.

814
00:38:27.86 --> 00:38:28.38
Our story.

815
00:38:28.38 --> 00:38:30.30
We went and got married in this guy's backyard,

816
00:38:30.30 --> 00:38:31.22
nobody knew.

817
00:38:31.22 --> 00:38:32.86
We were living in a house with team guys.

818
00:38:32.86 --> 00:38:36.22
I was living with him and four other team guys in a house.

819
00:38:36.22 --> 00:38:37.74
It was just like that.

820
00:38:37.74 --> 00:38:38.54
That was a good guy.

821
00:38:38.54 --> 00:38:41.98
We can at Bernys, you know, just my poor wife,

822
00:38:41.98 --> 00:38:44.46
my poor wife did that, too.

823
00:38:44.46 --> 00:38:47.58
She, well, it wasn't 14 guys, but it was me.

824
00:38:47.58 --> 00:38:53.46
My running mate team guy roommate who is just the best guy

825
00:38:53.46 --> 00:38:56.54
ever and also just like you can say, we were all crazy.

826
00:38:56.54 --> 00:38:59.02
And then so we lived in the upstairs apartment

827
00:38:59.02 --> 00:39:01.26
and then two other team guys lived below us.

828
00:39:01.26 --> 00:39:04.10
And it was just, well, I'm sure it was very similar

829
00:39:04.10 --> 00:39:07.10
to the environment you were in.

830
00:39:07.10 --> 00:39:11.06
You know, like the furniture was cruise boxes.

831
00:39:11.06 --> 00:39:15.06
Dinner was dominoes, breakfast was Guinness.

832
00:39:15.06 --> 00:39:16.98
Lunch was Yager Meister.

833
00:39:16.98 --> 00:39:18.54
And it was just me.

834
00:39:18.54 --> 00:39:20.14
Yeah, Chas Brother likes to say,

835
00:39:20.14 --> 00:39:23.06
remember his coming to visit and he got out of the shower.

836
00:39:23.06 --> 00:39:24.34
And it was so disgusting.

837
00:39:24.34 --> 00:39:27.38
He just took a paper towel and like pat it his body dry

838
00:39:27.38 --> 00:39:29.66
because he didn't want to use anything.

839
00:39:29.66 --> 00:39:31.82
I mean, I don't know if it was that gross maybe for him.

840
00:39:31.82 --> 00:39:34.50
But, you know, it was due to house.

841
00:39:34.50 --> 00:39:36.62
And you know, I got to live there.

842
00:39:36.62 --> 00:39:42.10
And there was one giant sofa that was the ugliest

843
00:39:42.10 --> 00:39:42.98
Chad had bought it.

844
00:39:42.98 --> 00:39:45.06
It was a scanned and navy in print.

845
00:39:45.06 --> 00:39:46.90
It was the tackiest ugliest thing.

846
00:39:46.90 --> 00:39:49.86
And literally his entire life, he still talked about that

847
00:39:49.86 --> 00:39:51.30
stupid sofa.

848
00:39:51.30 --> 00:39:55.70
So my wife and I, but my old running mate,

849
00:39:55.70 --> 00:40:00.86
we had this freaking couch that was gold.

850
00:40:00.86 --> 00:40:02.58
I think it's called velvet velvet.

851
00:40:02.58 --> 00:40:04.86
Is that what it's called like this kind of like a

852
00:40:04.86 --> 00:40:06.94
like really soft push back and forth.

853
00:40:06.94 --> 00:40:08.26
So it was gold velvet.

854
00:40:08.26 --> 00:40:10.82
It had some kind of wood carvings at the end.

855
00:40:10.82 --> 00:40:15.82
It had to have been more than 10 feet long.

856
00:40:15.82 --> 00:40:17.70
It was freaking huge.

857
00:40:17.70 --> 00:40:18.54
We couldn't do this.

858
00:40:18.54 --> 00:40:19.38
Yeah.

859
00:40:19.38 --> 00:40:21.18
And it was the most comfortable couch ever.

860
00:40:21.18 --> 00:40:24.06
And I think we got it at a whatever a thrift store for

861
00:40:24.06 --> 00:40:27.14
whatever $38 or something, best couch ever.

862
00:40:27.14 --> 00:40:28.14
That's what he says.

863
00:40:28.14 --> 00:40:31.02
And we could fit like three to four full size dudes on it.

864
00:40:31.02 --> 00:40:32.10
I think it was more typical.

865
00:40:32.10 --> 00:40:34.06
We'd wake up and one of them would be on the sofa

866
00:40:34.06 --> 00:40:35.78
just because it was comfortable.

867
00:40:35.78 --> 00:40:39.10
And they, the house, it was, there was a sofa.

868
00:40:39.10 --> 00:40:40.10
And there was a calculator.

869
00:40:40.10 --> 00:40:40.94
Is it?

870
00:40:40.94 --> 00:40:44.94
And when I told him to put decorations up,

871
00:40:44.94 --> 00:40:46.54
I was like, you guys need stuff on the wall.

872
00:40:46.54 --> 00:40:47.82
They hung shooting targets.

873
00:40:47.82 --> 00:40:52.70
Like the real ones, the pictures, the man on the woman,

874
00:40:52.70 --> 00:40:53.54
you have on the side.

875
00:40:53.54 --> 00:40:54.34
Does he have a weapon?

876
00:40:54.34 --> 00:40:56.10
Does not do a shoot him.

877
00:40:56.10 --> 00:40:58.94
That was when I froze in our house for a little while.

878
00:40:58.94 --> 00:40:59.94
Yeah.

879
00:40:59.94 --> 00:41:04.70
So you got like a heart of really nice welcome to the team community.

880
00:41:04.70 --> 00:41:05.42
It was.

881
00:41:05.42 --> 00:41:06.42
Yeah.

882
00:41:06.42 --> 00:41:10.38
It was such a different life back then.

883
00:41:10.38 --> 00:41:11.38
Yeah.

884
00:41:11.38 --> 00:41:15.02
And you go and out with the boys, like when my wife came over

885
00:41:15.02 --> 00:41:17.22
and we weren't married yet, but when she,

886
00:41:17.22 --> 00:41:19.54
when we started, which started living with me,

887
00:41:19.54 --> 00:41:22.50
she would like come out with us, you know, and hang.

888
00:41:22.50 --> 00:41:27.06
Oh yeah, we'd go out and burn it down.

889
00:41:27.06 --> 00:41:29.78
I, for, you know, I'm in Virginia Beach.

890
00:41:29.78 --> 00:41:31.22
And there's this bar that's been there forever.

891
00:41:31.22 --> 00:41:31.98
Hot tuna.

892
00:41:31.98 --> 00:41:33.02
They've since read done it.

893
00:41:33.02 --> 00:41:33.86
But it's hot.

894
00:41:33.86 --> 00:41:34.70
Hot tuna.

895
00:41:34.70 --> 00:41:36.90
I just went back literally like two weeks ago

896
00:41:36.90 --> 00:41:37.70
for the first time.

897
00:41:37.70 --> 00:41:39.98
And I thought I haven't been here in forever.

898
00:41:39.98 --> 00:41:42.02
And it took me back to a one night in particular,

899
00:41:42.02 --> 00:41:44.10
Chad drove a green Jeep Cherokee.

900
00:41:44.10 --> 00:41:46.62
Still was favorite car, always.

901
00:41:46.62 --> 00:41:49.38
And we went out with a bunch of guys.

902
00:41:49.38 --> 00:41:51.86
And we just lifted up the back gate,

903
00:41:51.86 --> 00:41:53.18
you know, and just shoved them in there.

904
00:41:53.18 --> 00:41:55.46
Instead of actually, you know, this is a one time go

905
00:41:55.46 --> 00:41:57.14
for get the seat belt shoving there.

906
00:41:57.14 --> 00:41:58.02
We went hot tuna.

907
00:41:58.02 --> 00:41:59.82
Sure enough, there was a fight.

908
00:41:59.82 --> 00:42:01.78
We got kicked out, told to leave.

909
00:42:01.78 --> 00:42:03.94
And I just remember running out there,

910
00:42:03.94 --> 00:42:05.06
throwing up the back gate.

911
00:42:05.06 --> 00:42:07.66
The guys getting in and we're out.

912
00:42:09.10 --> 00:42:11.34
And this lifestyle to you, what were you thinking?

913
00:42:11.34 --> 00:42:14.22
We were like, okay, well, this is the way it is.

914
00:42:14.22 --> 00:42:17.42
Yeah, I don't even think I thought anything.

915
00:42:17.42 --> 00:42:19.34
I just was in it.

916
00:42:19.34 --> 00:42:22.62
And you're military and military kid.

917
00:42:22.62 --> 00:42:26.18
And you understand just the camaraderie

918
00:42:26.18 --> 00:42:30.26
that can happen there and the sense of family

919
00:42:30.26 --> 00:42:31.54
that it can create.

920
00:42:32.62 --> 00:42:34.66
And I was really happy.

921
00:42:34.66 --> 00:42:38.94
And I think he was too to have made it to be a team guy.

922
00:42:38.94 --> 00:42:40.02
He was at teammate.

923
00:42:40.02 --> 00:42:42.18
Yeah.

924
00:42:42.18 --> 00:42:47.18
Yeah, I don't know if there's anything better

925
00:42:50.26 --> 00:42:53.82
than being an E5 in a seal put to.

926
00:42:53.82 --> 00:42:55.50
It's just freaking awesome.

927
00:42:55.50 --> 00:42:56.70
And it's everything you just said.

928
00:42:56.70 --> 00:42:59.42
Well, we had a big wedding later, right?

929
00:42:59.42 --> 00:43:01.38
So we had a big, I think for our family,

930
00:43:01.38 --> 00:43:03.34
they wanted like the bigger wedding.

931
00:43:03.34 --> 00:43:08.34
So in May of now we're gonna go to 2000, I guess.

932
00:43:08.34 --> 00:43:10.46
We got married.

933
00:43:10.46 --> 00:43:13.34
And so the boys all decided they were gonna come

934
00:43:13.34 --> 00:43:18.34
and they rented an RV and they drove from Virginia Beach

935
00:43:18.34 --> 00:43:20.90
to where we got married.

936
00:43:20.90 --> 00:43:23.94
And all my girlfriends from college had come

937
00:43:23.94 --> 00:43:27.34
and they were, you know, don't ask a dumb question.

938
00:43:27.34 --> 00:43:30.34
They were in the perception and you look around the room

939
00:43:30.34 --> 00:43:31.70
and there's one huge round table

940
00:43:31.70 --> 00:43:33.58
with all these really good looking dudes around it.

941
00:43:33.58 --> 00:43:35.74
And they grow so like, I think that's the Navy seals.

942
00:43:35.74 --> 00:43:37.74
Not only are they like a bunch of dudes

943
00:43:37.74 --> 00:43:38.58
and they're good looking.

944
00:43:38.58 --> 00:43:41.34
And couple of them had like a butterfly stitch on his forehead

945
00:43:41.34 --> 00:43:44.22
because they stopped in Savannah on that and bar fight.

946
00:43:44.22 --> 00:43:46.46
So it was like so appropriate, you know?

947
00:43:46.46 --> 00:43:47.30
It was good.

948
00:43:49.42 --> 00:43:51.62
When once you moved to Virginia Beach,

949
00:43:51.62 --> 00:43:53.14
he must've been in a workup.

950
00:43:53.14 --> 00:43:54.42
When did he go into employment?

951
00:43:56.06 --> 00:43:57.30
That's when I started to forget.

952
00:43:57.30 --> 00:43:59.02
So he's already done one to point him

953
00:43:59.02 --> 00:44:00.14
and he's on the ship.

954
00:44:00.14 --> 00:44:03.50
And then he comes back and then he did two more there.

955
00:44:04.50 --> 00:44:05.94
I honestly can't remember the months.

956
00:44:05.94 --> 00:44:10.14
And so he's going on to point for the first time

957
00:44:10.14 --> 00:44:11.74
or the first time that you're married.

958
00:44:11.74 --> 00:44:13.74
So it is, I guess it'd be his second appointment.

959
00:44:13.74 --> 00:44:14.58
Yeah.

960
00:44:14.58 --> 00:44:17.14
And now you're like, what did you just say in Virginia Beach

961
00:44:17.14 --> 00:44:19.14
did you go?

962
00:44:19.14 --> 00:44:22.46
So this was like I had to do the whole,

963
00:44:23.38 --> 00:44:25.70
I live there, I did my internship

964
00:44:25.70 --> 00:44:28.02
and we got really married for real.

965
00:44:28.02 --> 00:44:30.10
And oh, that's right, because he did deploy

966
00:44:30.10 --> 00:44:35.10
and I moved back home with my family during that second appointment.

967
00:44:35.10 --> 00:44:37.78
We were in the middle of like not living anywhere.

968
00:44:37.78 --> 00:44:39.14
So we lived with the team guys.

969
00:44:39.14 --> 00:44:41.66
We had our own apartment for a little while.

970
00:44:41.66 --> 00:44:44.06
And which was also one of the greatest times

971
00:44:44.06 --> 00:44:46.14
because you don't realize it at the time

972
00:44:46.14 --> 00:44:48.42
when you're young and you have no money

973
00:44:48.42 --> 00:44:52.62
and you live in an apartment I think it was $425 a month.

974
00:44:52.62 --> 00:44:55.50
Pleasure House Road, Shore Drive, Chicks Beach,

975
00:44:55.50 --> 00:44:57.26
like where everything goes down.

976
00:44:57.26 --> 00:44:58.62
Just how great that is.

977
00:44:58.62 --> 00:45:02.98
Who have nothing and you kind of need nothing.

978
00:45:02.98 --> 00:45:04.26
It's such simplicity.

979
00:45:04.26 --> 00:45:06.62
So anyway, we moved out of that apartment.

980
00:45:06.62 --> 00:45:07.90
He left on deployment.

981
00:45:07.90 --> 00:45:09.26
I went back home to stay with my family.

982
00:45:09.26 --> 00:45:12.54
What do you mean when you're living that little apartment?

983
00:45:12.54 --> 00:45:14.90
You know, like what makes that so good?

984
00:45:17.22 --> 00:45:19.50
I mean, there's nothing to take care of.

985
00:45:19.50 --> 00:45:20.50
It's an apartment.

986
00:45:21.50 --> 00:45:26.02
Our friend Lance Vicaro, who passed away in 2008,

987
00:45:26.02 --> 00:45:27.46
he lived in the same complex.

988
00:45:27.46 --> 00:45:29.62
So you should the shit with him when you see him.

989
00:45:29.62 --> 00:45:33.46
And yeah, just like making dinner and eating it on

990
00:45:33.46 --> 00:45:34.62
that we had a cruise box.

991
00:45:34.62 --> 00:45:36.90
One of those metal folding collapsible ones.

992
00:45:36.90 --> 00:45:37.74
Remember those?

993
00:45:37.74 --> 00:45:38.58
Oh yeah.

994
00:45:38.58 --> 00:45:39.26
That was our coffee table.

995
00:45:39.26 --> 00:45:42.02
He just put a little like table cloth over it.

996
00:45:42.02 --> 00:45:43.30
We'd eat there.

997
00:45:43.30 --> 00:45:45.66
I was like cooking meals in a crock pot.

998
00:45:45.66 --> 00:45:46.98
Terrible.

999
00:45:46.98 --> 00:45:48.98
Me and my buddy had a cruise box that we had,

1000
00:45:48.98 --> 00:45:51.94
like by the big gold couch, we had a cruise box

1001
00:45:51.94 --> 00:45:53.30
that had the phone on it.

1002
00:45:53.30 --> 00:45:55.90
And then on the cruise box was in Sharpie,

1003
00:45:55.90 --> 00:45:58.06
was written everyone's numbers from the different

1004
00:45:58.06 --> 00:46:00.78
tunes and like the T-Merry number.

1005
00:46:00.78 --> 00:46:02.66
Yeah, those are good times.

1006
00:46:02.66 --> 00:46:06.90
I was talking also about the, as you advance in life

1007
00:46:08.10 --> 00:46:11.06
when you get an apartment, that's like step one.

1008
00:46:11.06 --> 00:46:13.50
But then when you get an apartment that has,

1009
00:46:13.50 --> 00:46:14.46
tell them my kids this,

1010
00:46:14.46 --> 00:46:17.82
when you get an apartment that has a washer and dryer,

1011
00:46:17.82 --> 00:46:20.46
like on-site, and that's a big deal.

1012
00:46:20.46 --> 00:46:22.66
And then if you have one that has parking,

1013
00:46:22.66 --> 00:46:24.74
that's like the next big step up in life.

1014
00:46:24.74 --> 00:46:25.58
Yeah, yeah.

1015
00:46:25.58 --> 00:46:27.38
Those things are, those things bring you joy

1016
00:46:27.38 --> 00:46:28.74
when you're young and broke.

1017
00:46:28.74 --> 00:46:29.58
Yeah.

1018
00:46:29.58 --> 00:46:31.42
I've driven by that apartment a few times

1019
00:46:31.42 --> 00:46:32.98
in the last two years,

1020
00:46:32.98 --> 00:46:35.14
and all the places we've lived in Virginia Beach, you know.

1021
00:46:36.34 --> 00:46:39.14
Okay, so you do the big wedding.

1022
00:46:39.14 --> 00:46:39.98
Yep.

1023
00:46:39.98 --> 00:46:42.54
And all these, your girlfriends are there from college.

1024
00:46:42.54 --> 00:46:44.34
There's a bunch of team guys there.

1025
00:46:44.34 --> 00:46:46.50
That sounds like an awesome time.

1026
00:46:46.50 --> 00:46:49.82
And then he's going on to play me again.

1027
00:46:51.02 --> 00:46:55.02
Yeah, so he, we get married.

1028
00:46:55.86 --> 00:46:57.62
He goes on deployment.

1029
00:46:58.62 --> 00:47:00.86
I think before he left on deployment

1030
00:47:00.86 --> 00:47:03.70
is when I found out I was pregnant.

1031
00:47:03.70 --> 00:47:04.54
Mm-hmm.

1032
00:47:04.54 --> 00:47:05.38
Okay.

1033
00:47:05.38 --> 00:47:06.18
Yeah, which was another reason

1034
00:47:06.18 --> 00:47:07.38
they like took me home.

1035
00:47:07.38 --> 00:47:08.22
Okay.

1036
00:47:08.22 --> 00:47:10.18
So we weren't planning it,

1037
00:47:10.18 --> 00:47:11.58
but we weren't not planning it.

1038
00:47:11.58 --> 00:47:12.94
It was kind of like, you know,

1039
00:47:12.94 --> 00:47:14.14
we've been together forever.

1040
00:47:14.14 --> 00:47:16.22
And it is what it is.

1041
00:47:16.22 --> 00:47:17.86
So, so you get pregnant.

1042
00:47:19.10 --> 00:47:20.22
He goes on deployment.

1043
00:47:20.22 --> 00:47:21.06
Yeah.

1044
00:47:21.06 --> 00:47:22.42
You go home to,

1045
00:47:22.42 --> 00:47:23.26
Florida.

1046
00:47:23.26 --> 00:47:24.86
Okay, you're home to Florida.

1047
00:47:24.86 --> 00:47:27.78
And you're living, you know,

1048
00:47:27.78 --> 00:47:29.18
doing whatever you're doing.

1049
00:47:29.18 --> 00:47:33.94
Yeah, and this again was before we didn't have cell phones.

1050
00:47:33.94 --> 00:47:35.38
So, you know, this,

1051
00:47:36.38 --> 00:47:39.10
it's interesting when people are like upset

1052
00:47:39.10 --> 00:47:40.98
because they didn't get to like face time

1053
00:47:40.98 --> 00:47:43.98
what there has been on deployment in today's world, right?

1054
00:47:43.98 --> 00:47:45.74
Because I would miss phone calls.

1055
00:47:45.74 --> 00:47:47.62
And then you don't know when he's going to call you again.

1056
00:47:47.62 --> 00:47:50.46
And we have so many letters he wrote me.

1057
00:47:50.46 --> 00:47:51.78
I'm pretty grateful for that.

1058
00:47:51.78 --> 00:47:52.94
And so I'm in Florida.

1059
00:47:52.94 --> 00:47:54.22
He's deployed.

1060
00:47:54.22 --> 00:47:55.74
Trying to talk to him when I can.

1061
00:47:55.74 --> 00:47:59.54
Go on a baby in my belly and all the things.

1062
00:48:00.54 --> 00:48:01.70
And they come home.

1063
00:48:01.70 --> 00:48:03.50
When did you have the baby while he was on the plunder?

1064
00:48:03.50 --> 00:48:04.38
Did he come home in time?

1065
00:48:04.38 --> 00:48:05.34
Yeah, he came home.

1066
00:48:05.34 --> 00:48:08.38
So, because I was like super newly pregnant when he left.

1067
00:48:10.06 --> 00:48:12.78
So, we know what we're still staying in Virginia Beach.

1068
00:48:12.78 --> 00:48:15.26
So, I go up to Virginia Beach.

1069
00:48:15.26 --> 00:48:18.58
Super pregnant with my mom and buy our first house.

1070
00:48:18.58 --> 00:48:19.82
So, while he's gone.

1071
00:48:19.82 --> 00:48:20.66
So, we.

1072
00:48:20.66 --> 00:48:21.50
Yeah.

1073
00:48:21.50 --> 00:48:24.98
And then he came home from deployment.

1074
00:48:24.98 --> 00:48:27.70
May 2001.

1075
00:48:27.70 --> 00:48:30.26
And my daughter was born in August.

1076
00:48:30.26 --> 00:48:32.70
And now he's still at teammate.

1077
00:48:32.70 --> 00:48:34.42
He's done two deployments.

1078
00:48:34.42 --> 00:48:36.54
And yeah.

1079
00:48:36.54 --> 00:48:41.06
And it's your daughter was born in August of 2001.

1080
00:48:41.06 --> 00:48:42.06
Mm-hmm.

1081
00:48:42.06 --> 00:48:44.06
And he's in another platoon at this point?

1082
00:48:44.06 --> 00:48:45.06
Yeah.

1083
00:48:45.06 --> 00:48:47.34
And he.

1084
00:48:47.34 --> 00:48:49.98
So, he gets there as deployments.

1085
00:48:49.98 --> 00:48:54.46
And for the rest of his time there, he goes to night school.

1086
00:48:54.46 --> 00:48:56.34
Because he's trying to finish his degree.

1087
00:48:56.34 --> 00:48:58.58
So, he finishes his degree at ODU.

1088
00:48:58.58 --> 00:49:00.10
We have a new baby.

1089
00:49:00.10 --> 00:49:03.86
And then he finishes his time.

1090
00:49:03.86 --> 00:49:04.94
He was at trade-et.

1091
00:49:04.94 --> 00:49:05.94
Okay.

1092
00:49:05.94 --> 00:49:09.42
So, we're just like a young family, you know.

1093
00:49:09.42 --> 00:49:11.10
When September 11 happens.

1094
00:49:11.10 --> 00:49:13.86
So, is he at trade-et when September 11 happens?

1095
00:49:15.62 --> 00:49:18.78
He was at, ah.

1096
00:49:19.90 --> 00:49:21.50
Yeah, I think he might have been, actually.

1097
00:49:21.50 --> 00:49:22.50
Yeah.

1098
00:49:22.50 --> 00:49:24.42
And so September 11 happens.

1099
00:49:24.42 --> 00:49:26.22
Now, what are you thinking?

1100
00:49:26.22 --> 00:49:28.46
Ah, that's such crazy.

1101
00:49:28.46 --> 00:49:33.54
Everyone remembers where they were when that happened.

1102
00:49:33.54 --> 00:49:39.10
I don't even think I have the ability to think about it in the scope of the military.

1103
00:49:39.10 --> 00:49:43.10
And what the military was going to do or our country was going to do to react.

1104
00:49:43.10 --> 00:49:45.46
I just was dumbfounded.

1105
00:49:45.46 --> 00:49:46.78
Keep trying to call them at work.

1106
00:49:46.78 --> 00:49:48.06
Couldn't get a hold of them.

1107
00:49:48.06 --> 00:49:50.26
He eventually showed up at the house.

1108
00:49:50.26 --> 00:49:54.82
And we just kind of looked at each other and he's like, holy shit.

1109
00:49:54.82 --> 00:50:01.50
So, and at that point, did you, was he like, okay, I'm going to go back on deployment?

1110
00:50:01.50 --> 00:50:04.82
Was he, what was his plan at that point?

1111
00:50:06.82 --> 00:50:09.78
I mean, I think his plan was to just stay.

1112
00:50:09.78 --> 00:50:15.70
He, at that point, I think he always wanted to just be a career seal.

1113
00:50:15.70 --> 00:50:17.50
So, whatever was going to keep him in the game.

1114
00:50:17.50 --> 00:50:22.58
Quite honestly, we had a conversation after a deployment that he wanted to go to Damneck.

1115
00:50:22.58 --> 00:50:27.34
And I was like, no.

1116
00:50:27.34 --> 00:50:30.38
And I don't even know why I said no.

1117
00:50:30.38 --> 00:50:31.66
I never said no.

1118
00:50:31.66 --> 00:50:35.22
I always like supported him and encouraged him and pushed him.

1119
00:50:35.22 --> 00:50:39.02
But for some reason at that point, I didn't want him to go.

1120
00:50:39.02 --> 00:50:42.42
I don't know how it would have turned out if he would have gone then.

1121
00:50:42.42 --> 00:50:51.06
But yeah, so he stayed in the military, but then, because in all this, when he came home

1122
00:50:51.06 --> 00:50:57.70
from that last deployment, I got pregnant with our son or his third deployment at eight.

1123
00:50:57.70 --> 00:51:00.30
And that was when.

1124
00:51:00.30 --> 00:51:05.06
So, 2001, but fast forward, you know, we're in 2004.

1125
00:51:05.06 --> 00:51:14.10
And I think we both kind of, well, I would say it's more me, we wanted something different.

1126
00:51:14.10 --> 00:51:15.58
So Chad wanted to be a seal.

1127
00:51:15.58 --> 00:51:17.30
He always wanted to be a door kicker.

1128
00:51:17.30 --> 00:51:20.58
That's what he wanted to do, you know, hide in the bushes and do all the things.

1129
00:51:20.58 --> 00:51:25.94
And as military kids, I was really trying to do something different.

1130
00:51:25.94 --> 00:51:28.10
And the grass is greener on the other side, right?

1131
00:51:28.10 --> 00:51:31.34
I moved all the time and I didn't want my kids to have to move all the time.

1132
00:51:31.34 --> 00:51:34.18
And I didn't want their dad to be gone all the time.

1133
00:51:34.18 --> 00:51:37.34
We talked about it and we were making the decision to get out of the military.

1134
00:51:37.34 --> 00:51:40.42
So he had been in 10 years at this point.

1135
00:51:40.42 --> 00:51:43.02
And it's 2004.

1136
00:51:43.02 --> 00:51:44.62
His son is born.

1137
00:51:44.62 --> 00:51:48.26
He wrapped up that last deployment.

1138
00:51:48.26 --> 00:51:50.82
And we got out and moved to Raleigh, North Carolina.

1139
00:51:50.82 --> 00:51:52.62
Do you know where he went?

1140
00:51:52.62 --> 00:51:55.02
No, did he go to Iraq, Raff Ganeson on that deployment?

1141
00:51:55.02 --> 00:51:57.78
Or did he do a different deployment like over to you, Com, or something?

1142
00:51:57.78 --> 00:52:02.70
Uh, I should know these statistics and facts better, but I don't.

1143
00:52:02.70 --> 00:52:04.62
I mean, I'm like 23 with a baby.

1144
00:52:04.62 --> 00:52:05.62
Yeah.

1145
00:52:05.62 --> 00:52:09.26
Well, this would be very similar to asking my wife what I went on to point to you.

1146
00:52:09.26 --> 00:52:10.74
Like I had no idea he was gone.

1147
00:52:10.74 --> 00:52:12.66
That was my wife's attitude too.

1148
00:52:12.66 --> 00:52:13.66
Yeah.

1149
00:52:13.66 --> 00:52:14.66
He's gone.

1150
00:52:14.66 --> 00:52:15.66
He'll be back later.

1151
00:52:15.66 --> 00:52:16.66
Yeah.

1152
00:52:16.66 --> 00:52:21.70
So you all make this decision to get out.

1153
00:52:21.70 --> 00:52:22.70
Right.

1154
00:52:22.70 --> 00:52:24.46
And then what's the plan?

1155
00:52:24.46 --> 00:52:29.74
So at that point, his family's now living in Raleigh, North Carolina.

1156
00:52:29.74 --> 00:52:32.70
And he has his college degree.

1157
00:52:32.70 --> 00:52:36.50
He's done 10 years in the military and he thinks, okay, I'm going to get out and I'm going

1158
00:52:36.50 --> 00:52:39.98
to provide for my family and a civilian world.

1159
00:52:39.98 --> 00:52:40.98
And that's what we did.

1160
00:52:40.98 --> 00:52:42.42
And he got a job in pharmaceuticals.

1161
00:52:42.42 --> 00:52:45.26
You know, there's a lot of research there.

1162
00:52:45.26 --> 00:52:50.10
Um, kind of irony in that when I'm sitting here thinking about him and his life and the

1163
00:52:50.10 --> 00:52:51.26
path that he chose.

1164
00:52:51.26 --> 00:52:59.70
But he was in pharmaceutical research and we just hated it from moment we left.

1165
00:52:59.70 --> 00:53:02.74
I think most people are creatures of habit.

1166
00:53:02.74 --> 00:53:03.94
It's my belief, right?

1167
00:53:03.94 --> 00:53:07.18
People are creatures of habit whether you like that habit or you don't like the habit.

1168
00:53:07.18 --> 00:53:08.74
It's, it just is what it is.

1169
00:53:08.74 --> 00:53:12.30
And our habit is that we are military kids.

1170
00:53:12.30 --> 00:53:19.18
We are used to adversity and challenge and changing dynamics on the regular.

1171
00:53:19.18 --> 00:53:25.70
We're used to different situations and the idea of living in the same house, doing the same

1172
00:53:25.70 --> 00:53:29.66
job with the same people for the rest of your life is nauseating.

1173
00:53:29.66 --> 00:53:32.90
And I don't think it was challenging for him.

1174
00:53:32.90 --> 00:53:38.50
And while he did one of his last jumps with the guys before he left, the guys jumped out

1175
00:53:38.50 --> 00:53:41.26
of the plane and they're like, you're not going to do this with your pharmaceutical

1176
00:53:41.26 --> 00:53:49.34
dudes, you know, and I think that always bugged him.

1177
00:53:49.34 --> 00:53:56.70
And I think like most of these guys, they don't want to feel like they quit, I guess.

1178
00:53:56.70 --> 00:54:02.54
And for Chad anyway, separating from the military and not retiring, he probably felt like

1179
00:54:02.54 --> 00:54:04.30
he wasn't finished.

1180
00:54:04.30 --> 00:54:05.94
And I felt that too because he was miserable.

1181
00:54:05.94 --> 00:54:06.94
He was miserable.

1182
00:54:06.94 --> 00:54:10.86
How long did it take for buyers to set in?

1183
00:54:10.86 --> 00:54:13.86
Like when you get to North Carolina, was there any sort of like honey mood period?

1184
00:54:13.86 --> 00:54:16.50
Hey, we can go on a picnic today and we don't have to worry about anything.

1185
00:54:16.50 --> 00:54:17.50
Oh yeah, yeah.

1186
00:54:17.50 --> 00:54:18.50
How long did that last?

1187
00:54:18.50 --> 00:54:24.10
I mean, I think it lasted for about a year, even though I think in the back of our

1188
00:54:24.10 --> 00:54:26.62
minds, we'd lay in bed and we're like, he'd say,

1189
00:54:26.62 --> 00:54:27.62
what are we doing?

1190
00:54:27.62 --> 00:54:28.62
What are we doing?

1191
00:54:28.62 --> 00:54:30.62
Like, how do they get real?

1192
00:54:30.62 --> 00:54:36.46
Yeah, at night, you know, but then it's like, okay, we're doing it, though, because

1193
00:54:36.46 --> 00:54:39.14
because at the same time, you see it as a challenge in some ways.

1194
00:54:39.14 --> 00:54:43.94
You're like, and I doubting myself because I want to go back or my doubting myself, because

1195
00:54:43.94 --> 00:54:46.90
now I just have this new challenge and I got to like overcome it.

1196
00:54:46.90 --> 00:54:49.46
What was he doing for the pharmaceutical company?

1197
00:54:49.46 --> 00:54:56.30
He was a project manager and I think he was I candy for all the girls and off.

1198
00:54:56.30 --> 00:55:01.30
I know this because my sister in law works in the field too and she would tell me stories,

1199
00:55:01.30 --> 00:55:11.82
but yeah, he tell, I just, he said to me, he came home and he's like Sarah, I was

1200
00:55:11.82 --> 00:55:18.82
sitting in the break room today, celebrating a baby shower, eating a pink, fucking cupcake,

1201
00:55:18.82 --> 00:55:20.90
and I'm questioning my life.

1202
00:55:20.90 --> 00:55:24.18
And you're like, okay, I don't think this is going to work.

1203
00:55:24.18 --> 00:55:30.38
And as cool as it is to have him home every day and he had a good job, we made good

1204
00:55:30.38 --> 00:55:31.74
money, the American dream.

1205
00:55:31.74 --> 00:55:35.30
I mean, our house had a wrap around porch, no joke.

1206
00:55:35.30 --> 00:55:36.30
The picket fence.

1207
00:55:36.30 --> 00:55:42.30
I mean, by most standards, I don't even know if that's fair to say any more in today's

1208
00:55:42.30 --> 00:55:49.02
world, but it was the quote American dream, but it was not our dream.

1209
00:55:49.02 --> 00:55:51.94
How far into it was the cupcake incident?

1210
00:55:51.94 --> 00:55:52.94
Was that like two months into it?

1211
00:55:52.94 --> 00:55:53.94
No, that was closer to the other.

1212
00:55:53.94 --> 00:55:55.82
Those are towards that and that was probably about two years.

1213
00:55:55.82 --> 00:55:58.02
That was like the cupcake that broke the camel's back.

1214
00:55:58.02 --> 00:55:59.02
Totally.

1215
00:55:59.02 --> 00:56:01.22
Pink cupcake broke them.

1216
00:56:01.22 --> 00:56:06.18
I think it just was a real pivot point and this isn't to bash cupcakes or baby showers

1217
00:56:06.18 --> 00:56:13.86
or any of those things, but he's just a dude, you know?

1218
00:56:13.86 --> 00:56:15.50
He's a military dude.

1219
00:56:15.50 --> 00:56:20.58
He's a knife-carrying, you know, dude.

1220
00:56:20.58 --> 00:56:27.86
And for him to put on a business suit in a tie every day, you just, people shouldn't be

1221
00:56:27.86 --> 00:56:31.62
things they're not and that's not who he was.

1222
00:56:31.62 --> 00:56:36.26
So what was the total time that he made it in the pharmaceutical?

1223
00:56:36.26 --> 00:56:44.18
So he left the military in 2004 and we were back in the military September of 2007.

1224
00:56:44.18 --> 00:56:46.82
So like two and a half, two and a half years.

1225
00:56:46.82 --> 00:56:47.82
Yeah.

1226
00:56:47.82 --> 00:56:53.18
When he, like, okay, so he comes home from the cupcake incident, or you just like,

1227
00:56:53.18 --> 00:56:56.66
you can see the misery in his face and you're like, all right, I'm good.

1228
00:56:56.66 --> 00:56:57.66
Let's go.

1229
00:56:57.66 --> 00:56:58.66
Yeah.

1230
00:56:58.66 --> 00:56:59.66
Yeah.

1231
00:56:59.66 --> 00:57:06.50
I, that, we also, I mean, I remember being in the living room and hearing about red wings

1232
00:57:06.50 --> 00:57:12.26
and I was sitting in the living room and watching it on TV and just, him just, you know,

1233
00:57:12.26 --> 00:57:16.38
he was just sitting there, kind of had his hands on his head and he was totally shit.

1234
00:57:16.38 --> 00:57:21.26
I think that probably had a large part, even though we didn't come back for some time,

1235
00:57:21.26 --> 00:57:24.38
I think those things weighed on him.

1236
00:57:24.38 --> 00:57:25.82
The way the world was changing.

1237
00:57:25.82 --> 00:57:26.82
It was ramping up.

1238
00:57:26.82 --> 00:57:29.94
We're now a couple years past 9.11.

1239
00:57:29.94 --> 00:57:34.30
He, he felt called to go back.

1240
00:57:34.30 --> 00:57:40.22
Then he makes a phone call, talk to like some guy or whatever and team guy recruiter or something.

1241
00:57:40.22 --> 00:57:41.22
Yeah.

1242
00:57:41.22 --> 00:57:42.94
We didn't really know how that was going to play out, right?

1243
00:57:42.94 --> 00:57:45.90
I mean, they could have just said, no, you left.

1244
00:57:45.90 --> 00:57:51.22
But I think at the time, you know, he, you know, he was a team guy that done a few deployments.

1245
00:57:51.22 --> 00:57:53.98
He had good service, respected.

1246
00:57:53.98 --> 00:57:55.30
They said sure.

1247
00:57:55.30 --> 00:58:00.22
But they told him because he hadn't deployed in, you know, almost three years.

1248
00:58:00.22 --> 00:58:04.38
He had to go back through, um, oh, S-t-t.

1249
00:58:04.38 --> 00:58:06.14
Well, it was S-t-t when he graduated.

1250
00:58:06.14 --> 00:58:07.14
Yeah.

1251
00:58:07.14 --> 00:58:08.14
S-t-t-t.

1252
00:58:08.14 --> 00:58:09.14
S-t-t-t.

1253
00:58:09.14 --> 00:58:10.14
Yeah.

1254
00:58:10.14 --> 00:58:13.14
So, we, I mean, he left for work one day.

1255
00:58:13.14 --> 00:58:14.14
He had talked to this guy.

1256
00:58:14.14 --> 00:58:16.74
He was kind of figuring out if this was going to work or not.

1257
00:58:16.74 --> 00:58:17.94
And he left for work one day.

1258
00:58:17.94 --> 00:58:22.66
And I just said, his tie and his suit and all of the, I said, this is stupid.

1259
00:58:22.66 --> 00:58:30.46
We got to go back and we sold our house and he signed up to go back and we sold a lot

1260
00:58:30.46 --> 00:58:32.38
of what we owned.

1261
00:58:32.38 --> 00:58:36.18
And because there was no need to have it, we were going to move to California.

1262
00:58:36.18 --> 00:58:39.70
He said if he had to go back to their S-t-t again, he wanted to just go to a West Coast

1263
00:58:39.70 --> 00:58:43.66
team, um, just so we could all be out there together.

1264
00:58:43.66 --> 00:58:51.10
And we put a little bit of things in a U-hall and the kids and I flew out to San Diego.

1265
00:58:51.10 --> 00:58:52.82
And I had never been there.

1266
00:58:52.82 --> 00:58:56.86
Oh, I came out and like house-hunted, try to find an apartment for us a couple weeks prior,

1267
00:58:56.86 --> 00:58:59.78
but other than that, I hadn't really spent any time out here.

1268
00:58:59.78 --> 00:59:05.42
And he drove a U-hall across country, chowing down on some flower seeds and just going

1269
00:59:05.42 --> 00:59:13.34
like 90 and like, you know, jacked up on caffeine and got there.

1270
00:59:13.34 --> 00:59:14.74
Then where did you guys move into?

1271
00:59:14.74 --> 00:59:15.74
Did you guys move to Coronado?

1272
00:59:15.74 --> 00:59:16.74
Yeah.

1273
00:59:16.74 --> 00:59:20.26
We found this cool little, I just got lucky, found this cool little apartment.

1274
00:59:20.26 --> 00:59:22.54
Same thing, kind of like our first apartment.

1275
00:59:22.54 --> 00:59:26.58
It, I mean, this place can be more than 800 square feet.

1276
00:59:26.58 --> 00:59:29.66
It was two bedrooms, one bathroom.

1277
00:59:29.66 --> 00:59:35.50
It was our entire B-A-H, maybe even a little bit more, and our kids shared a room.

1278
00:59:35.50 --> 00:59:38.26
Did you say you had been to San Diego before or you had not?

1279
00:59:38.26 --> 00:59:43.70
I had only come out like a week or two before to try to find a place to live.

1280
00:59:43.70 --> 00:59:47.14
What were you thinking when you drove from San Diego over the Coronado Bay Bridge and you

1281
00:59:47.14 --> 00:59:48.14
see Coronado first?

1282
00:59:48.14 --> 00:59:50.74
I was flipping my live.

1283
00:59:50.74 --> 00:59:53.54
I just was like, yes, amazing.

1284
00:59:53.54 --> 00:59:56.90
It's one of the craziest sites I think.

1285
00:59:56.90 --> 01:00:00.02
Were you bringing anyone to San Diego and you going to Coronado and you drive over the

1286
01:00:00.02 --> 01:00:01.70
bridge and you just see Coronado?

1287
01:00:01.70 --> 01:00:02.70
Yeah.

1288
01:00:02.70 --> 01:00:03.70
It's ridiculous.

1289
01:00:03.70 --> 01:00:04.70
It is.

1290
01:00:04.70 --> 01:00:05.70
It's ridiculous.

1291
01:00:05.70 --> 01:00:11.70
I've spent most of my youth on the East Coast and almost always close to a beach.

1292
01:00:11.70 --> 01:00:14.34
I always, you know, I don't want to live more than 30 minutes from a beach.

1293
01:00:14.34 --> 01:00:15.34
Let's be honest.

1294
01:00:15.34 --> 01:00:21.06
So the fact that I could flip coast and live here and on Coronado is, yeah.

1295
01:00:21.06 --> 01:00:22.94
And there's the mosquitoes here.

1296
01:00:22.94 --> 01:00:29.30
I had the friend coming out and him and his wife and like it was getting to be dusk.

1297
01:00:29.30 --> 01:00:31.02
And they were like, oh, the mosquitoes are going to call him.

1298
01:00:31.02 --> 01:00:32.02
Like there's no mosquitoes here.

1299
01:00:32.02 --> 01:00:33.02
They didn't believe me.

1300
01:00:33.02 --> 01:00:34.02
They didn't believe.

1301
01:00:34.02 --> 01:00:35.02
They didn't believe.

1302
01:00:35.02 --> 01:00:37.94
And you're talking about how could there be no mosquitoes?

1303
01:00:37.94 --> 01:00:40.14
It's totally crazy.

1304
01:00:40.14 --> 01:00:42.34
So now you're living in Coronado.

1305
01:00:42.34 --> 01:00:43.34
Yeah.

1306
01:00:43.34 --> 01:00:48.42
Kind of living the dream, taking bikes around the sidewalk, walking to get coffee and

1307
01:00:48.42 --> 01:00:49.42
all that stuff.

1308
01:00:49.42 --> 01:00:50.42
Oh, yeah.

1309
01:00:50.42 --> 01:00:55.50
I got a rad little beach cruiser, chatbot me and kids were little and my son learned

1310
01:00:55.50 --> 01:00:58.38
to ride a two-wheeler at two.

1311
01:00:58.38 --> 01:01:02.34
And he had this little mini bike and we made friends with the guy in the bike shop and

1312
01:01:02.34 --> 01:01:05.54
his name's my son's Hudson and Hudson would ride in the bike shop on Monday.

1313
01:01:05.54 --> 01:01:08.98
The guy's like, hey, little man, come here and he swapped out.

1314
01:01:08.98 --> 01:01:10.50
I should show you a picture of this.

1315
01:01:10.50 --> 01:01:13.50
He swapped out at the handlebars of his bike for a-pangers.

1316
01:01:13.50 --> 01:01:14.50
Oh, dang.

1317
01:01:14.50 --> 01:01:17.70
So he just like he turned three and he was a three year old with this like little

1318
01:01:17.70 --> 01:01:20.10
mini bike and he's a pay-panger handlebars.

1319
01:01:20.10 --> 01:01:22.46
That's great.

1320
01:01:22.46 --> 01:01:24.58
And chat's going to ask you tea this time.

1321
01:01:24.58 --> 01:01:26.66
So ask you tea just serve on those.

1322
01:01:26.66 --> 01:01:29.34
When you get done with buds, you go.

1323
01:01:29.34 --> 01:01:33.70
You graduate from buds and after buds they start to teach you some stuff in this thing called

1324
01:01:33.70 --> 01:01:34.70
that's QT.

1325
01:01:34.70 --> 01:01:38.98
You don't really learn anything in buds other than how to go through suffering and then

1326
01:01:38.98 --> 01:01:44.30
you get to ask you tea and they start teaching you like all the fundamental basic individual

1327
01:01:44.30 --> 01:01:47.22
skills of being a seal at a higher level.

1328
01:01:47.22 --> 01:01:50.26
And occasionally like Chad's a perfect example.

1329
01:01:50.26 --> 01:01:54.58
Guys, guys out for three years, hey, we got new radios.

1330
01:01:54.58 --> 01:01:56.58
We need, we can't just throw them back in a cartoon.

1331
01:01:56.58 --> 01:01:57.74
All right, send them through ask you tea.

1332
01:01:57.74 --> 01:01:59.02
So occasionally that happens.

1333
01:01:59.02 --> 01:02:01.06
Sometimes God doesn't even have to get out.

1334
01:02:01.06 --> 01:02:05.86
If a guy's on short duty for three years and he's been in some billet where he's not

1335
01:02:05.86 --> 01:02:10.02
operational for three years, that'll be like, hey, you know, you go back to rescue tea and

1336
01:02:10.02 --> 01:02:12.10
use a guy's a cool, you got it.

1337
01:02:12.10 --> 01:02:18.26
And so you're doing individual skills, but he, in that position, all the other guys, first

1338
01:02:18.26 --> 01:02:21.06
of all the other guys don't even have their tridents yet.

1339
01:02:21.06 --> 01:02:23.90
So he's a actual seal.

1340
01:02:23.90 --> 01:02:28.90
And they're, they're just not even new guys yet because they don't even have their

1341
01:02:28.90 --> 01:02:29.90
tridents.

1342
01:02:29.90 --> 01:02:36.14
So he's in a position of like real mentorship and to help them out and they're looking

1343
01:02:36.14 --> 01:02:37.14
up to him.

1344
01:02:37.14 --> 01:02:39.70
So that's, that's what's happening with him.

1345
01:02:39.70 --> 01:02:40.70
Definitely.

1346
01:02:40.70 --> 01:02:47.86
He, one thing I always loved about Chad is he is very good at teaching you what he

1347
01:02:47.86 --> 01:02:51.62
knows without making you feel dumb.

1348
01:02:51.62 --> 01:02:55.22
I think he gets a lot of that probably from his dad and his, the way his dad is.

1349
01:02:55.22 --> 01:03:02.98
But I think that that's a real skill and try to like foster your own learning while he's

1350
01:03:02.98 --> 01:03:03.98
teaching you something.

1351
01:03:03.98 --> 01:03:09.66
And so I think it was a really natural fit for him while he was in SQT to just be the

1352
01:03:09.66 --> 01:03:14.90
guy that would, you know, lean into guys and say, hey man, this is how I like rig my gear

1353
01:03:14.90 --> 01:03:15.90
up this way.

1354
01:03:15.90 --> 01:03:18.34
And I, you know, do this this way.

1355
01:03:18.34 --> 01:03:23.62
And I think it was a good experience, hopefully, for the guys that were with them, you

1356
01:03:23.62 --> 01:03:28.78
know, to have this more senior person around, but it was also good for Chad.

1357
01:03:28.78 --> 01:03:31.86
And this didn't you start doing CrossFit at this time out here?

1358
01:03:31.86 --> 01:03:32.86
Oh, yeah.

1359
01:03:32.86 --> 01:03:33.86
Yeah.

1360
01:03:33.86 --> 01:03:35.26
And was that Andy's gym?

1361
01:03:35.26 --> 01:03:36.26
Andy stopped.

1362
01:03:36.26 --> 01:03:37.26
Yeah.

1363
01:03:37.26 --> 01:03:42.42
So the reason I'm laughing is because, you know, you're talking about how Chad was the type

1364
01:03:42.42 --> 01:03:47.62
of person that could teach you something without making you feel bad about what you don't

1365
01:03:47.62 --> 01:03:48.62
know.

1366
01:03:48.62 --> 01:03:50.26
I think Andy might be the opposite of that.

1367
01:03:50.26 --> 01:03:53.98
Andy, like, enjoys their feet got to teach somebody something.

1368
01:03:53.98 --> 01:03:56.58
He teaches me stuff that I already know he makes me feel stupid.

1369
01:03:56.58 --> 01:03:57.58
Yeah.

1370
01:03:57.58 --> 01:03:58.58
That's definitely more his personality.

1371
01:03:58.58 --> 01:03:59.58
He likes to have fun with it.

1372
01:03:59.58 --> 01:04:00.58
Yeah.

1373
01:04:00.58 --> 01:04:01.58
Yeah, definitely.

1374
01:04:01.58 --> 01:04:05.02
So you, so this is Andy had like a CrossFit gym in Coronado.

1375
01:04:05.02 --> 01:04:06.02
Yeah.

1376
01:04:06.02 --> 01:04:07.42
And so you just rolled in there and signed up.

1377
01:04:07.42 --> 01:04:09.34
Did you know anything about CrossFit at the time?

1378
01:04:09.34 --> 01:04:12.42
So when we were in Raleigh, Chad started doing CrossFit.

1379
01:04:12.42 --> 01:04:14.78
This was like 2005.

1380
01:04:14.78 --> 01:04:17.14
And he was so into CrossFit.

1381
01:04:17.14 --> 01:04:19.18
I was so not into CrossFit.

1382
01:04:19.18 --> 01:04:20.86
It was kind of how that played out.

1383
01:04:20.86 --> 01:04:23.94
I remember Cook and Dinner one night and he said, you need to come in the garage.

1384
01:04:23.94 --> 01:04:27.42
I got this thing called a muscle up and I was like, oh, and I opened the door and he did

1385
01:04:27.42 --> 01:04:28.42
it and I was like, cool.

1386
01:04:28.42 --> 01:04:29.42
And then slam the door.

1387
01:04:29.42 --> 01:04:31.94
Like a total jerk.

1388
01:04:31.94 --> 01:04:37.10
So he had put me through some workouts and our garage in Raleigh, but I, that minimal exposure,

1389
01:04:37.10 --> 01:04:42.22
you know, and living in Coronado and having two little kids and he's busy with work.

1390
01:04:42.22 --> 01:04:44.06
I feel like, you know, I'm a mom with two kids.

1391
01:04:44.06 --> 01:04:46.22
I probably need to exercise a little bit more.

1392
01:04:46.22 --> 01:04:51.26
Right in my bike one day, I just passed the gym and it was news like literally like just

1393
01:04:51.26 --> 01:04:53.26
opening and I called him.

1394
01:04:53.26 --> 01:04:55.22
Didn't know Andy Stomp at the time.

1395
01:04:55.22 --> 01:04:58.58
Called him up and said, hey, can I come to your gym and that was it?

1396
01:04:58.58 --> 01:04:59.58
That was it.

1397
01:04:59.58 --> 01:05:01.14
Was he teaching?

1398
01:05:01.14 --> 01:05:07.18
Not as much as wife Jamie was teaching a lot.

1399
01:05:07.18 --> 01:05:08.66
Sage Castro.

1400
01:05:08.66 --> 01:05:11.14
Dave Castro's wife was coaching their son.

1401
01:05:11.14 --> 01:05:12.14
Right on.

1402
01:05:12.14 --> 01:05:14.14
It was such, you know, this was the early days.

1403
01:05:14.14 --> 01:05:21.18
We were talking 2007 of, you know, of CrossFit gym kind of expanding.

1404
01:05:21.18 --> 01:05:24.14
And so it was a small gym, not a lot of trainers.

1405
01:05:24.14 --> 01:05:31.90
Yeah, this is so like this is when Dave Castro was teaching SQT.

1406
01:05:31.90 --> 01:05:32.90
Yes.

1407
01:05:32.90 --> 01:05:39.70
And like I think they ran a level one course at SQT.

1408
01:05:39.70 --> 01:05:43.70
And I went and went through it and just like hung out and got whatever some kind of

1409
01:05:43.70 --> 01:05:45.34
certification for that.

1410
01:05:45.34 --> 01:05:50.14
And then that's probably the first time that I met and started hanging out with Dave Castro.

1411
01:05:50.14 --> 01:05:53.38
I think that's it because he was running that and he was like helping me out.

1412
01:05:53.38 --> 01:05:58.02
And then we eventually, well, when we opened this gym that we're sitting in right now, that

1413
01:05:58.02 --> 01:05:59.02
was 2007.

1414
01:05:59.02 --> 01:06:00.26
That was late 2007.

1415
01:06:00.26 --> 01:06:06.14
So we had the, you know, I had to go to the like the shirts and stuff like this that

1416
01:06:06.14 --> 01:06:08.34
you have to get back in the day.

1417
01:06:08.34 --> 01:06:09.34
Yeah.

1418
01:06:09.34 --> 01:06:11.02
He's going to try to keep your gym.

1419
01:06:11.02 --> 01:06:12.46
Yeah, to keep your gym.

1420
01:06:12.46 --> 01:06:14.46
And so you get, you get into it.

1421
01:06:14.46 --> 01:06:15.46
You kind of get into it.

1422
01:06:15.46 --> 01:06:19.58
Yeah, I do, I get really into it.

1423
01:06:19.58 --> 01:06:21.46
I just, you know, I like the challenge.

1424
01:06:21.46 --> 01:06:22.62
I like the physical challenge.

1425
01:06:22.62 --> 01:06:25.14
I like the way my body was changing.

1426
01:06:25.14 --> 01:06:26.54
Remember I'm a mom, a two kids.

1427
01:06:26.54 --> 01:06:30.02
So yeah, I get into it.

1428
01:06:30.02 --> 01:06:32.66
And so I got the opportunity to go to my level one.

1429
01:06:32.66 --> 01:06:36.26
Didn't want to coach people ever, never, never my plan.

1430
01:06:36.26 --> 01:06:37.58
I just wanted to know more about it.

1431
01:06:37.58 --> 01:06:42.14
So I went to my level one in San Diego one weekend.

1432
01:06:42.14 --> 01:06:43.14
Yeah.

1433
01:06:43.14 --> 01:06:46.26
Okay, and then Chad, what's SQT 6, 6 months?

1434
01:06:46.26 --> 01:06:47.26
Something like that.

1435
01:06:47.26 --> 01:06:48.26
Yeah.

1436
01:06:48.26 --> 01:06:52.70
And he's thinking West Coast team, you're living the dream, living in Coronado.

1437
01:06:52.70 --> 01:06:53.70
Yeah.

1438
01:06:53.70 --> 01:06:55.70
And then what happens there?

1439
01:06:55.70 --> 01:06:59.30
Well, Bill King happened.

1440
01:06:59.30 --> 01:07:06.34
The CEO from Damneck came to the West Coast to talk to the SQT guys and to explain

1441
01:07:06.34 --> 01:07:11.82
to them down the pipeline if they want to ever, you know, bridge that gap and head

1442
01:07:11.82 --> 01:07:14.30
over to Seal Team 6.

1443
01:07:14.30 --> 01:07:16.30
Here's kind of what you need to do.

1444
01:07:16.30 --> 01:07:19.70
Most of those guys when they finished SQT as you said they get their trident, they go to

1445
01:07:19.70 --> 01:07:25.82
a regular team, they've got to do two to three deployments, you know, become maybe a little

1446
01:07:25.82 --> 01:07:29.14
less green and then they can screen to go to Damneck.

1447
01:07:29.14 --> 01:07:33.82
And that's when Chad went and took it upon himself to introduce himself to him and say,

1448
01:07:33.82 --> 01:07:35.82
hey, my name is Chad Wilkinson.

1449
01:07:35.82 --> 01:07:37.38
Here's a little bit of my story.

1450
01:07:37.38 --> 01:07:38.38
I'm going to finish this up.

1451
01:07:38.38 --> 01:07:41.78
I'm going to go to West Coast team and then in the future, I plan to go to the West Coast team.

1452
01:07:41.78 --> 01:07:46.82
And I'm coming to screen and he just said, how about you don't and just come screen right

1453
01:07:46.82 --> 01:07:47.82
now?

1454
01:07:47.82 --> 01:07:49.82
That was that.

1455
01:07:49.82 --> 01:07:52.54
Yeah, and he didn't consult me at all.

1456
01:07:52.54 --> 01:07:55.86
So what did you get six months in the nodo?

1457
01:07:55.86 --> 01:07:57.50
Yeah, that's just about it.

1458
01:07:57.50 --> 01:07:58.70
I was pretty upset.

1459
01:07:58.70 --> 01:08:01.14
I mean, but not, right?

1460
01:08:01.14 --> 01:08:05.50
I mean, this is our life and this is our path, but I did not want to leave.

1461
01:08:05.50 --> 01:08:09.30
Yeah, he came home and he said, hey, I'm going to fly to Virginia Beach next weekend and

1462
01:08:09.30 --> 01:08:13.42
do this thing to screen and if that's the case, we're moving.

1463
01:08:13.42 --> 01:08:18.26
And yeah, fast forward, we moved back to Virginia Beach April of 2008.

1464
01:08:18.26 --> 01:08:22.74
Did you move back there even before like while he's starting to go through green team and

1465
01:08:22.74 --> 01:08:23.74
everything?

1466
01:08:23.74 --> 01:08:25.62
Oh, yeah, yeah, we moved like with him.

1467
01:08:25.62 --> 01:08:30.26
Like he left to go to green team, we moved back.

1468
01:08:30.26 --> 01:08:36.22
So then he makes it through green team and starts the cycle over there, which is deployment,

1469
01:08:36.22 --> 01:08:39.18
deployment, deployment, work deployment, work deployment, work deployment, work deployment, work

1470
01:08:39.18 --> 01:08:40.18
deployment, work deployment, work deployment.

1471
01:08:40.18 --> 01:08:45.66
At that time, yeah, 2008 it was fast and furious.

1472
01:08:45.66 --> 01:08:47.06
It was busy.

1473
01:08:47.06 --> 01:08:51.98
And when you get to Virginia Beach, are you, what'd you do with your CrossFit deal?

1474
01:08:51.98 --> 01:08:54.22
So I moved back to Virginia Beach.

1475
01:08:54.22 --> 01:08:59.98
I check out, at the time, there were only two other gyms in the area and I couldn't

1476
01:08:59.98 --> 01:09:05.22
really take my kids because this was before there were a lot of kids spaces in CrossFit

1477
01:09:05.22 --> 01:09:08.10
gyms and there was really no where safer them to be.

1478
01:09:08.10 --> 01:09:13.38
We rented an apartment when we came back to Virginia Beach not knowing where we wanted to live.

1479
01:09:13.38 --> 01:09:16.02
And also not knowing if the whole green team thing was going to pan out.

1480
01:09:16.02 --> 01:09:20.34
I think for Chad, he just was like, I don't really know.

1481
01:09:20.34 --> 01:09:26.50
And he rented a garage in this apartment complex and we bought enough equipment so that

1482
01:09:26.50 --> 01:09:30.90
we could put two people he and I essentially threw a workout.

1483
01:09:30.90 --> 01:09:34.10
And then my girlfriend said, well, can I come work out with you?

1484
01:09:34.10 --> 01:09:36.42
I was like, sure.

1485
01:09:36.42 --> 01:09:41.62
And then that just kind of grew and grew and then we had a whole bunch of people outside

1486
01:09:41.62 --> 01:09:44.98
of the garage one day and fast forward October 2008.

1487
01:09:44.98 --> 01:09:46.42
I opened my gym.

1488
01:09:46.42 --> 01:09:55.22
So he's in green team and anybody who's listening and has lived that is very stressful.

1489
01:09:55.22 --> 01:09:59.70
Especially when you're doing all these things and you come home and you got your wife

1490
01:09:59.70 --> 01:10:02.14
and your kids and you got to do the family man thing too.

1491
01:10:02.14 --> 01:10:06.06
And then I go ahead to take it upon myself to start this whole business venture.

1492
01:10:07.18 --> 01:10:07.34
Yeah.

1493
01:10:08.38 --> 01:10:11.74
You rented, how many of you was the space that you rented for that CrossFit gym?

1494
01:10:12.30 --> 01:10:13.02
Oh, the first one?

1495
01:10:13.02 --> 01:10:13.34
Yeah.

1496
01:10:13.34 --> 01:10:14.06
Who?

1497
01:10:14.06 --> 01:10:17.10
It was like 12 to 1300 square feet.

1498
01:10:17.90 --> 01:10:24.46
And I just remember saying in the car, I was like, I need to do this because this is,

1499
01:10:24.46 --> 01:10:28.14
this is about to take off and this is what all I want to do.

1500
01:10:28.14 --> 01:10:33.34
I think he was a little worried because, you know, in our,

1501
01:10:33.34 --> 01:10:41.42
in our, in our, in our, in our world, you live a really quiet life and he didn't want anything that I was doing

1502
01:10:41.42 --> 01:10:48.38
to not overshadow but have any sort of imprint on what he was doing.

1503
01:10:48.38 --> 01:10:48.54
Yeah.

1504
01:10:48.54 --> 01:10:55.34
You know, and of course in a military town, the, the interesting part about Oating the gym is

1505
01:10:55.34 --> 01:11:01.82
what you're doing is you're providing a service to people and it's a very personal service.

1506
01:11:01.82 --> 01:11:07.66
So people think they know you and what happens is your friends come and join the gym and I had kind of

1507
01:11:07.66 --> 01:11:13.02
established at the very beginning like we're friends, but at the same time this is, this is a, you know,

1508
01:11:13.02 --> 01:11:18.06
a business and you do, if, if you're a team life, you don't talk about it in this gym.

1509
01:11:18.94 --> 01:11:21.58
You don't, I don't want to hear when your husband's coming home.

1510
01:11:21.58 --> 01:11:23.26
I don't want to hear when your husband's leaving.

1511
01:11:23.26 --> 01:11:24.78
I don't want to hear about another spouse.

1512
01:11:25.66 --> 01:11:26.78
That just wasn't going to fly.

1513
01:11:27.74 --> 01:11:29.50
So, so we were busy.

1514
01:11:30.22 --> 01:11:31.18
I would too little kids.

1515
01:11:31.18 --> 01:11:33.18
And how did the gym take off? How did it do?

1516
01:11:33.18 --> 01:11:34.54
It went, it was awesome.

1517
01:11:35.18 --> 01:11:41.90
My whole hope was just to be able to cover the rent and my expenses and we exceeded that the first month.

1518
01:11:42.30 --> 01:11:43.10
The first month.

1519
01:11:44.06 --> 01:11:48.70
And we were still working on a lot of things though, you know, the first person that came

1520
01:11:48.70 --> 01:11:53.18
beyond my kids and they had a little kid, I didn't know what to do with them. So I stacked up some

1521
01:11:53.18 --> 01:11:58.14
tires and I just stuck the kid in the center of the tires. I like to just stay there,

1522
01:11:58.14 --> 01:12:02.38
to where done. Because it was such a small space. I look back at those pictures now.

1523
01:12:02.38 --> 01:12:07.18
I'll land anybody from CrossFit listening. And I do not know how someone didn't get clubbed

1524
01:12:07.18 --> 01:12:11.26
in the head of the barbell. How close we were, but it all worked out.

1525
01:12:12.70 --> 01:12:18.14
In meanwhile, Chad's, like you said, this is now 2008. So it's just, um, it's on.

1526
01:12:18.14 --> 01:12:24.30
Yeah. And he's going on deployments. And now we kind of already talked about this. And I mentioned

1527
01:12:24.30 --> 01:12:29.10
that my wife would be like, I don't even know where my husband's at. He's gone. And he'll be back later.

1528
01:12:29.10 --> 01:12:35.58
And that was kind of her attitude. And it's, I think quite frankly, well, I can't speak for

1529
01:12:35.58 --> 01:12:40.70
everybody, but it definitely worked for my wife. You know, she just, hey, you go do what you

1530
01:12:40.70 --> 01:12:45.42
got to do. I'll be here. I'll be here, man in the fort, back home. And that was good.

1531
01:12:45.42 --> 01:12:49.42
Maybe it would have been more stressful if she knew where I was or what I was doing or anything

1532
01:12:49.42 --> 01:12:54.62
like that. She just was like, you go do what you got to do. Did you guys have that? Was that sort

1533
01:12:54.62 --> 01:13:01.18
of the way you guys operated? Yeah. I mean, when he, when he was deploying, it was Iraq, Afghanistan,

1534
01:13:01.82 --> 01:13:09.02
then it became Africa. And I knew, generally, you know, what country he was in. But beyond that,

1535
01:13:09.02 --> 01:13:16.78
that's how we always operated was you do your job. And I'll do my job, meaning take care of our

1536
01:13:16.78 --> 01:13:20.54
kids when you're gone. And when you're gone, you're gone and when you're home, your home.

1537
01:13:21.58 --> 01:13:26.22
I know some other spouses, they share a whole lot. And they, they know probably way more stories

1538
01:13:26.22 --> 01:13:34.38
about their husband than I know. And maybe almost too much, but Chad really, really lived by the fact

1539
01:13:34.38 --> 01:13:39.26
that you don't talk about it. And it could have much to what you said, maybe he just didn't want

1540
01:13:39.26 --> 01:13:45.90
me to worry either. That's what I'd like to think. And vice versa, I didn't call him and say,

1541
01:13:46.70 --> 01:13:51.66
I mean, my hot water heater busted one time in the attic and flooding everywhere. What's it

1542
01:13:51.66 --> 01:14:00.38
going to do if I call him? And now, so you know, seal why it's a tough to. Yeah, definitely. And I think,

1543
01:14:00.38 --> 01:14:05.18
you know, you said, you said you weren't sure if Chad didn't want you to worry. I can almost

1544
01:14:05.18 --> 01:14:11.18
guarantee you that the attitude was like the last thing he wants you to do is worry. And I remember

1545
01:14:11.90 --> 01:14:17.74
one of my guys, Mikey Montsour, who, you know, he died at the end of our deployment. But when

1546
01:14:17.74 --> 01:14:25.42
when I got home and talking to his family and his sister Sarah was, you know, just telling me,

1547
01:14:25.42 --> 01:14:31.42
this was, we were in this place called Ramani. It was a really kinetic deployment with a lot of

1548
01:14:31.42 --> 01:14:38.46
casualties. And he had told his family, you know, when he would call them, oh yeah, we're just,

1549
01:14:38.46 --> 01:14:42.22
you know, we're just training some Iraqis. We're, yeah, if we're not doing anything, it's boring,

1550
01:14:42.22 --> 01:14:46.86
like all these kind of things. I mean, these are just outright not true at all. But he just didn't

1551
01:14:46.86 --> 01:14:51.90
want his family to worry about what he was doing. Yeah, and we had certain like code things. I knew

1552
01:14:51.90 --> 01:14:57.42
when he would call me and he would say, okay, I'll call you when I can and I love you,

1553
01:14:57.42 --> 01:15:02.94
he was going out. He was going out to do stuff. And I, you know, what he called me in a day,

1554
01:15:02.94 --> 01:15:07.18
would it be three or four days? I don't know, but I knew that meant he was going to be busy.

1555
01:15:08.22 --> 01:15:14.54
And I'll also say, like, from my perspective again, this is just me. But I don't want to talk to my

1556
01:15:14.54 --> 01:15:19.18
wife about that stuff. You know, I don't want to talk to my wife. I don't want to explain to her what's

1557
01:15:19.18 --> 01:15:24.06
going on with this. And what I don't want, I don't want to talk to her about like what are kids are doing

1558
01:15:24.06 --> 01:15:28.30
or what we're having for dinner or whatever. I want to talk about other stuff. That's what I want to

1559
01:15:28.30 --> 01:15:34.22
talk about. I don't want to talk about team guy stuff with my wife. That's not, so maybe that,

1560
01:15:34.22 --> 01:15:41.02
you know, plays into it too. And yeah, I mean, like I said, my wife would shoot barely know

1561
01:15:41.02 --> 01:15:45.26
what I was going or whatever. And it's partly because I didn't want to worry about, but also,

1562
01:15:45.26 --> 01:15:51.50
I just don't want to talk about other stuff. Yeah. Talk about work. You know,

1563
01:15:51.50 --> 01:15:56.86
19 hours with these dudes. I want to talk about it with you, darling. I don't want to talk about

1564
01:15:56.86 --> 01:16:03.10
something else. But at some point, you must have realized, or did you start to see like,

1565
01:16:03.10 --> 01:16:09.74
hey, these things are wearing on Chad? These deployments are like, was there a change in his

1566
01:16:09.74 --> 01:16:22.38
attitude and his personality in the way he carried himself? Yes, and no, I think it's hard to

1567
01:16:22.38 --> 01:16:29.18
distinguish when exactly that was. And I'm going to bounce around a minute. I just had to scroll

1568
01:16:29.18 --> 01:16:33.26
through a bunch of photos, Jason and I were working on something. And they're scrolling through

1569
01:16:33.26 --> 01:16:40.70
those photos the other day. What I realized is when he really got bad, it was two years before he

1570
01:16:40.70 --> 01:16:51.50
died. So 2016, I can almost see it through photos. But even before that, I do know, I know some

1571
01:16:51.50 --> 01:16:57.66
stories now since he's died that he never shared with me in 2012 was a pretty big deployment,

1572
01:16:57.66 --> 01:17:02.86
I guess, or crazy deployment. I don't know the best way to say that. And I think some stuff

1573
01:17:02.86 --> 01:17:13.02
happened there. And 2014, he was starting to change a little bit more. But what a spouse says is,

1574
01:17:13.90 --> 01:17:21.90
well, that's just how they are. And the world, the media talks, you know, maybe seals are big

1575
01:17:21.90 --> 01:17:30.70
in the news now, right? Since 9-11, since May of 2011, they're all over and they're made to be

1576
01:17:30.70 --> 01:17:37.58
larger than life. And they use these words. And so if a guy has always told how brave and fearless

1577
01:17:37.58 --> 01:17:44.06
and heroic and strong they are, then he's got to believe that. He's got to live that. And then on

1578
01:17:44.06 --> 01:17:51.02
the same token, you see with our special operators how they are, you know, quiet and how they do

1579
01:17:51.02 --> 01:17:55.58
sit in the corner of the room. And their back is always, you know, to the wall. And they're always

1580
01:17:55.58 --> 01:18:00.54
facing the door. And they don't want to engage in conversational all the time. And just

1581
01:18:00.54 --> 01:18:07.50
chalk up all those PTSD symptoms that people like to throw out. But it's, I think it's very easy

1582
01:18:07.50 --> 01:18:12.38
for someone like a spouse to say, well, that's just kind of how the guys are. Because they have a

1583
01:18:12.38 --> 01:18:19.10
stressful job. And they're beat down. Their bodies broken. So, so you said when you're looking at

1584
01:18:19.10 --> 01:18:25.42
pictures now and you're going through the years, you can kind of start to identify things that you

1585
01:18:25.42 --> 01:18:30.46
saw that you, when you look back, it becomes a little bit, this has become more obvious as you look back.

1586
01:18:30.86 --> 01:18:36.70
Yeah, yeah. I mean, I, I couldn't tell you then. But it's, it's more obvious to me now.

1587
01:18:37.74 --> 01:18:43.82
This might be a dumb question. But do you think that that has to do with the fact that we don't

1588
01:18:43.82 --> 01:18:50.46
get taught anything about this kind of stuff? We mean, and maybe it's more prevalent now. But

1589
01:18:50.46 --> 01:19:02.86
you know, I did a couple podcasts on here about Louis Poler, Louis Poler Jr. He was the son of a

1590
01:19:02.86 --> 01:19:11.58
famous Marine, the most famous Marine named Chester Poler. And Louis Poler was, he, his dad,

1591
01:19:11.58 --> 01:19:21.50
Chester Poler was like the, the most iconic Marine ever. And he received five Navy crosses. And he,

1592
01:19:22.30 --> 01:19:29.18
the, here's a good way to describe how iconic he is. He, the Marine Corps has a, has a,

1593
01:19:30.38 --> 01:19:36.62
what is it a mascot? And they've had one. It's a bulldog. And yeah, the mascot, I think they're on number

1594
01:19:36.62 --> 01:19:42.86
17, but the mascot is named Chester. And at boot camp, they sing a good night Chester,

1595
01:19:42.86 --> 01:19:46.46
whatever, you may be. That's what they do in Marine Corps, Lucas. So this guy, Chester Poler,

1596
01:19:46.46 --> 01:19:55.74
the most iconic Marine of all time. And he had a son. And his son was, uh, not quite cut from the

1597
01:19:55.74 --> 01:20:01.02
same cloth as his dad. You know, his dad was this kind of gruff guy. And this son was sort of

1598
01:20:01.02 --> 01:20:10.22
a more mild guy. He wore glasses. He went to college. He, uh, was just more of a cerebral type guy.

1599
01:20:10.22 --> 01:20:13.58
And he gets done with college. And he's not really sure what he's going to do with his life.

1600
01:20:14.22 --> 01:20:20.06
So he decides to, well, you know, my dad was in the Marine Corps. So he goes to join the Marine

1601
01:20:20.06 --> 01:20:26.62
Corps. He can barely get in because his, his eyesight's bad. The people that are looking at his

1602
01:20:26.62 --> 01:20:31.82
application are like, wait a second, this is Lewis Poler Jr. Are you Chester Poler son? Is that,

1603
01:20:31.82 --> 01:20:37.02
yeah, but we can get you in. So he gets in the Marine Corps. Goes through Hofstra County School,

1604
01:20:37.02 --> 01:20:47.10
goes to the basics school. And then it's 1968. So he goes to Vietnam. And when he gets to Vietnam,

1605
01:20:49.50 --> 01:20:55.74
going on rotations in these three different spots. And eventually, uh, goes on an operation.

1606
01:20:55.74 --> 01:21:03.10
And he steps on a landmine. Get severely wounded. He loses both of his legs. He loses a bunch of his

1607
01:21:03.10 --> 01:21:09.18
fingers and dexterity in his hands. Almost dies. I mean, it's just a miracle that they were able

1608
01:21:09.18 --> 01:21:17.66
to keep my life. And he, he does stay alive. Um, it comes back to America. You know, devastating

1609
01:21:17.66 --> 01:21:29.02
for his dad, the great iconic Marine hero is breaking down when he sees his son. Chester Poler,

1610
01:21:29.98 --> 01:21:36.38
Lewis Poler, you know, eventually recovered from his wounds. And uh, wrote a book called

1611
01:21:36.38 --> 01:21:42.14
Fortune at Son, which is an incredible book. And sort of, you know, he was, he'd gone down the path of

1612
01:21:42.14 --> 01:21:50.86
alcohol and being an alcoholic and all this. And, um, eventually comes out of that writes this book,

1613
01:21:50.86 --> 01:22:00.62
the book, it's published. And in 1994, he fell out of his wheelchair injured himself, went back

1614
01:22:00.62 --> 01:22:08.06
in the hospital. Um, they put him on painkillers. He got addicted to painkillers again. And, and he killed himself.

1615
01:22:08.06 --> 01:22:17.18
Um, and what was, when I, when I did this series of podcasts about this, what was crazy was

1616
01:22:17.98 --> 01:22:24.94
every single Marine, every single Marine, 100% knows who Chester Poler is. But,

1617
01:22:26.86 --> 01:22:32.46
a vast majority of Marines that I talked to as that podcast was coming out, did not know

1618
01:22:32.46 --> 01:22:42.86
the story of his son. And it seems like the perfect way to educate people about the

1619
01:22:44.14 --> 01:22:47.82
hardships that people face when they come home for more and they, you know, obviously,

1620
01:22:47.82 --> 01:22:54.46
Lewis Poler had a multitude of hardships as well. But it seems like the education that we receive

1621
01:22:55.66 --> 01:23:00.46
and not just us in the military, but then the families just that there's things, hey,

1622
01:23:00.46 --> 01:23:09.18
this is what we need to be looking out for. And it, it seems like if you're, if you now are looking

1623
01:23:09.18 --> 01:23:16.38
back at pictures to be able to say, man, I see this. I remember this. These are the kind of things.

1624
01:23:16.38 --> 01:23:21.18
Is this like, like part of the things that you're trying to share now so that people have

1625
01:23:21.18 --> 01:23:28.62
better education about this kind of stuff? Oh my gosh. Yes. Yes. And again, I'm no scientist. I'm

1626
01:23:28.62 --> 01:23:35.42
no doctor. I don't have a research under my belt, but I have what I've lived. And sitting in my chair,

1627
01:23:36.62 --> 01:23:42.54
having been with this person for so long. You know, we, we, I didn't just like meet a team guy,

1628
01:23:42.54 --> 01:23:47.18
and then we got married, and that's not to bust on anybody that did. But, you know, I've known

1629
01:23:47.18 --> 01:23:55.02
him almost his entire life. And then to watch him through his career and then to lose him in this way,

1630
01:23:55.02 --> 01:24:05.98
I didn't see all these signs and symptoms prior. I think if Chad, I want to believe that if Chad

1631
01:24:05.98 --> 01:24:12.30
thought something was wrong with him that he was probably trying to hide it from me. I have

1632
01:24:12.30 --> 01:24:18.54
other girlfriends, widows, whose husbands took their life. And they have said that their husbands

1633
01:24:18.54 --> 01:24:23.58
expressed to them the struggle they were having and what they were thinking about. And you know,

1634
01:24:24.94 --> 01:24:29.82
their signs and symptoms, and I didn't have that. And it's not going to be the same for everybody

1635
01:24:29.82 --> 01:24:35.82
or humans or all different. Biological DNA, I'd express itself differently. But if we could maybe

1636
01:24:36.62 --> 01:24:47.50
educate people a little bit more about the toll your service takes. And, and to know that even if you're

1637
01:24:47.50 --> 01:24:53.98
not killed in action or killed in training or you don't die by suicide, but you've led a very

1638
01:24:54.54 --> 01:25:02.22
active career. You are going to be impacted some more than others. And let's really have a conversation

1639
01:25:02.22 --> 01:25:06.78
about what you might see and when is it going to be really problem?

1640
01:25:06.78 --> 01:25:17.26
So as these deployments are adding up for Chad, I mean, is when he's coming home, is it

1641
01:25:17.82 --> 01:25:27.50
what is the kind of things you're noticing? Well, he's always super quiet guy, never the loudest guy in

1642
01:25:27.50 --> 01:25:38.38
the room reserved. But as time goes on, he's even less. And when we first, you know, a teammate

1643
01:25:38.38 --> 01:25:42.70
we hung out with people and had friends and when we first got to the command, we did that too.

1644
01:25:42.70 --> 01:25:47.82
And then over time, we just didn't. We didn't do social things. I mean, we almost never

1645
01:25:47.82 --> 01:25:55.34
ever had anyone over to our house, ever. He never wanted anybody in our house. He, he any

1646
01:25:55.34 --> 01:25:59.42
says he likes to be home. He like to be home with the kids and I kind of what you mentioned. He's like,

1647
01:25:59.42 --> 01:26:04.38
I'm with those dudes all the time. Like, I don't need to go hang out with them because I've just spent,

1648
01:26:04.38 --> 01:26:11.58
you know, a rut trip in Chicago with them and I'm home now. But it, it, it, what got really bad right

1649
01:26:11.58 --> 01:26:19.26
away was a sleep. And I think that that's true for a lot of the guys is that, you know, sleep is so

1650
01:26:19.26 --> 01:26:23.82
valued. And it's, if you think of your body, I like to think of it as a computer. And if you don't

1651
01:26:23.82 --> 01:26:27.82
turn the computer down every once in a while and reboot boot it and it gets jacked up, right?

1652
01:26:27.82 --> 01:26:34.62
Doesn't run well. And that's what sleep provides all of us every single night. And if you've got a guy

1653
01:26:35.02 --> 01:26:42.94
who has his body hurts, I mean, Chad fell off of a ladder, pretty high up and Jack does back up.

1654
01:26:42.94 --> 01:26:48.62
He messed his neck up off of a couple of blending. He did. He was in the helicopter crash in 98.

1655
01:26:48.62 --> 01:26:56.86
So, you know, I mean, his body, and I say this because I know so many of the guys are like really

1656
01:26:56.86 --> 01:27:02.06
broken and he's probably the least of it in terms of broken bones and this and that, but his body

1657
01:27:02.06 --> 01:27:08.94
is beat up as most of them are. And then you add on top of that just the mental strain of war.

1658
01:27:08.94 --> 01:27:19.10
Just deployments, you know, sleep and over and some shitty ass village compound, you know,

1659
01:27:19.10 --> 01:27:25.66
you're listening to blast coming in. The high cycle of just like missions going out, going out,

1660
01:27:25.66 --> 01:27:30.86
going out, okay? Being away from your family and even though I didn't call my husband and say,

1661
01:27:30.86 --> 01:27:36.14
hey, this is broken or I need this. Maybe that's all other spouses communicates. And now there

1662
01:27:36.14 --> 01:27:41.90
might be stress because they got shit going on back home with their family and so let's all

1663
01:27:41.90 --> 01:27:47.50
add all that on to it. And now let's add at least for our special operators, the whole blast injury

1664
01:27:47.50 --> 01:27:55.58
concept. And the guys that have spent time and I'm going to talk teams because that's what I know,

1665
01:27:55.58 --> 01:28:04.70
but time and the teams, the last 10 to 20 years, they 100% in my opinion are affected by blast injury

1666
01:28:04.70 --> 01:28:09.34
because it comes from them breaching doors, which they do not just overseas, but in training,

1667
01:28:09.34 --> 01:28:15.42
you know, he lows RPGs all that and that constant impact to the brain is

1668
01:28:17.82 --> 01:28:25.18
terrible. It's terrible. And so you add all this stuff this guy's a con through and he can't sleep.

1669
01:28:26.14 --> 01:28:32.14
He can't get a good night's sleep. So there's nothing helping him for his body to at least try to

1670
01:28:32.14 --> 01:28:39.02
recover something. So his sleep went down bad. See, as he seen doctors or anything, as he

1671
01:28:39.02 --> 01:28:42.78
talking to anybody about trying to get sleep. I mean, sometimes, you know, at some points, they were

1672
01:28:42.78 --> 01:28:49.90
given away like the sleep potions like it was nothing. Oh, yeah. I mean, he did, he tried to do a lot of

1673
01:28:49.90 --> 01:28:55.82
his own stuff, just like normal regular remedy stuff and better sleep hygiene. And then he was

1674
01:28:55.82 --> 01:29:01.18
diagnosed with sleep apnea, which a lot of them have. So they have a CPAP machine. I mean, why are

1675
01:29:01.18 --> 01:29:08.94
their dudes in their 30s and 40s with sleep apnea? Doesn't, and not weird. And then, you know,

1676
01:29:08.94 --> 01:29:14.94
and then what you also see in these guys is they get low testosterone and because of, you know,

1677
01:29:14.94 --> 01:29:19.82
there are adrenal glands or jacked out. Their cortisol levels are jacked up. And so their testosterone

1678
01:29:19.82 --> 01:29:24.62
is jacked up. And I don't know how many of them are really willing to talk about it, but I think

1679
01:29:24.62 --> 01:29:29.98
there's a really large number of dudes in special operations that are in their 30s

1680
01:29:29.98 --> 01:29:35.50
that are on testosterone. And they're not, I can't speak for everyone. I mean, I think they're

1681
01:29:35.50 --> 01:29:39.66
on it for like the next time they want to be jacked. They're on it because their teeth really low.

1682
01:29:39.66 --> 01:29:48.70
And that's needed, you know? Oh, yeah, that's not getting fired up. Yeah. So, you're seeing all this

1683
01:29:48.70 --> 01:29:55.98
stuff. Is there a point where you start like trying to intervene yourself or is Chad just like,

1684
01:29:55.98 --> 01:30:02.94
you know, again, I'm comparing this to my experience. Like, I would never, my wife didn't know

1685
01:30:02.94 --> 01:30:07.50
if there was anything going on. Like, with bad things, we're happening at work. My wife would not know.

1686
01:30:07.50 --> 01:30:14.78
Well, and this is where like regret comes in and just kind of guilt. A lot of guilt.

1687
01:30:17.42 --> 01:30:22.46
Because it's really easy to sit here now and list all the things I could have done to be a

1688
01:30:22.46 --> 01:30:37.82
better wife. But at the time, I... Chad and I, Chad and I are both the type of people that

1689
01:30:38.62 --> 01:30:45.26
we want to work really hard at what we do and we want to be really, really freaking good at it.

1690
01:30:47.26 --> 01:30:51.66
Being married to him while there are spouses and they choose to, to, whatever they're out,

1691
01:30:51.66 --> 01:30:55.34
maybe they work, maybe they stay out with their kids, everybody gets a choice, right?

1692
01:30:55.34 --> 01:31:01.90
And my choice was to work and go this whole fitness CrossFit path. So, when you're married to someone

1693
01:31:01.90 --> 01:31:05.50
who's its neighbor, you see, and does all these awesome things and gets these awards,

1694
01:31:05.50 --> 01:31:10.62
I was super proud of them, but I also wanted my own identity and I wanted my own success.

1695
01:31:11.34 --> 01:31:17.34
And in a lot of that driving force, truthfully, was always because I wanted him to be proud of me.

1696
01:31:17.34 --> 01:31:24.14
And so he's working hard in the teams and I'm working really hard on this whole CrossFit side.

1697
01:31:24.94 --> 01:31:32.30
And I don't think it's that I didn't want to intervene. I just kind of thought we both were

1698
01:31:33.50 --> 01:31:38.94
almost like handling our shit. If that's fair to say. Like, okay, you're working, you're busy,

1699
01:31:39.66 --> 01:31:46.06
you know, you're moving up, you know, within your troop and squadron and the whole thing. And

1700
01:31:46.06 --> 01:31:49.98
I'm doing it over here and then we come home and we take our kids and

1701
01:31:52.46 --> 01:31:55.42
I guess I just didn't take enough of responsibility for that.

1702
01:32:03.58 --> 01:32:07.10
Is there, is there some point where you say, okay, this was sort of

1703
01:32:09.66 --> 01:32:14.30
where you said, you said when you were looking through pictures, you said two years before you died,

1704
01:32:14.30 --> 01:32:19.74
you were like, yeah, I look back now and that this is a time period where there was definitely

1705
01:32:20.30 --> 01:32:26.78
he was, you know, over the edge. Yeah, I mean, he really got a shorter fuse for sure.

1706
01:32:28.38 --> 01:32:34.06
And it generally wasn't with me. It tended to be more with our kids. He would just snap,

1707
01:32:34.06 --> 01:32:43.42
which was really out of character for him. And he would not listen. And I think a lot of

1708
01:32:43.42 --> 01:32:47.66
spouses say, you know, my husband doesn't listen to me. I've doesn't listen to me when I'm talking,

1709
01:32:47.66 --> 01:32:53.34
but it's like he had no idea I was talking to. And I'd be sitting right next to him. And

1710
01:32:56.46 --> 01:33:01.02
I've shared this story before, but I think it really says something that he,

1711
01:33:01.74 --> 01:33:06.46
I said, Chad, you never listened to me. Like, just look at me. I need you to look at me and I need

1712
01:33:06.46 --> 01:33:12.78
you to focus. And he said, you know what, when you talk to me, I have to look around and think,

1713
01:33:12.78 --> 01:33:17.66
well, that's not going to kill me. And that's not going to kill me. And I remember thinking,

1714
01:33:17.66 --> 01:33:26.22
that's so weird. But now I realize if you're kind of in this hyper state and you don't have a way to

1715
01:33:26.22 --> 01:33:30.06
get out of it, you go into a poignant and you kind of have to stay on point, right? Heads always

1716
01:33:30.06 --> 01:33:35.02
on a swivel, you may win your in bed, you got to be ready for the next thing. How do you turn that off

1717
01:33:35.02 --> 01:33:42.30
when you come home? I'm not sure. I'm not sure. They've really figured that out. So they come home

1718
01:33:42.30 --> 01:33:47.42
and they're still kind of like overloaded. And that's something that you notice because you're talking

1719
01:33:47.42 --> 01:33:53.98
to them and he's like not responding. And yeah, and in the pictures two years prior and the pictures

1720
01:33:53.98 --> 01:33:58.30
when I look at it, he just had a completely different look on his face. It was almost like,

1721
01:33:59.82 --> 01:34:04.22
like in pictures, it was almost like I'm going to kill you, you know, like that whole like,

1722
01:34:04.22 --> 01:34:12.70
it just, it's just not like him. Yeah, that's the interesting thing that you pointed out is like

1723
01:34:12.70 --> 01:34:19.10
you've known him since he was whatever 15. Yeah. And so you see this entire arc of a human

1724
01:34:19.66 --> 01:34:28.54
whereas, you know, if you cut out, if you met him in 2010, you would see this much smaller picture

1725
01:34:28.54 --> 01:34:35.58
that maybe wouldn't paint such a dramatic change in his character and the way he acted. Right?

1726
01:34:35.58 --> 01:34:43.58
But you saw him since he was 15 years old and, you know, and then you see this whole story play out.

1727
01:34:43.58 --> 01:34:50.86
And so it becomes real clear. There also being said, since you're with him every day,

1728
01:34:50.86 --> 01:34:55.42
you know, you're around him all the time. So there's also that that thing where,

1729
01:34:55.42 --> 01:34:59.98
you know, you don't notice that someone, you know, like, you don't notice that my hair's going

1730
01:34:59.98 --> 01:35:05.34
right, right? Because like my wife doesn't, she might notice it now. But, you know, over time.

1731
01:35:05.34 --> 01:35:09.74
So like, oh, your hair went great today, right? It's like happens gradually over time. And so

1732
01:35:09.74 --> 01:35:14.54
there's some of that. I'm sure it play too where, you know, one deployment, there's three degrees

1733
01:35:14.54 --> 01:35:19.10
of change, right? The next deployment, there's four degrees of change. The next deployment,

1734
01:35:19.10 --> 01:35:25.26
there's five degrees of change. Okay. So you look up in six deployments and that little bit each time

1735
01:35:25.26 --> 01:35:31.82
you may not notice it so dramatically. But from the, the, the amount that he's on a different course,

1736
01:35:31.82 --> 01:35:38.78
mentally is dramatic. Yeah. And I, and I, I tried to take it back through chunks of our life.

1737
01:35:38.78 --> 01:35:45.18
And go back as far as our childhood. But more like when we were at teammate, how he was with his

1738
01:35:45.18 --> 01:35:49.82
fellow team guys and peers in the way that we interacted with them. And then when we got out of

1739
01:35:49.82 --> 01:35:54.54
the military, the way that he was. And, you know, we had friends and did all the things normal

1740
01:35:54.54 --> 01:36:00.38
couples and families do. And then coming back and then being at the command for the first couple

1741
01:36:00.38 --> 01:36:08.30
years, it was that way. And then slowly he just did less and less socially. He was a little more

1742
01:36:08.30 --> 01:36:16.06
cut off. And then as it got farther along, he just was a little quieter. And, you know, the last

1743
01:36:16.06 --> 01:36:26.54
year or two of his life, I'm, I'd sad. I'm like, gosh, I don't even know how much he smiled.

1744
01:36:27.26 --> 01:36:34.86
Yeah. And no, um, no, no, him saying like, hey, I got to talk to somebody.

1745
01:36:34.86 --> 01:36:46.38
No, no.

1746
01:36:46.38 --> 01:36:53.66
Which, um, I mean, I, I'm guessing it's changing now. But I mean, that's the culture from

1747
01:36:53.66 --> 01:37:01.50
buds, from basic seal training. Don't go to medical. Right? Don't go to medical. Don't talk

1748
01:37:01.50 --> 01:37:06.70
to anybody. If you've got a stress for action, your leg, let it break. Don't go to medical.

1749
01:37:06.70 --> 01:37:11.10
Hobble around as long as you can. Don't like that's, and again, it's not like anybody.

1750
01:37:11.10 --> 01:37:14.06
Of course, what do the instructors say? Yep, go to medical. Check in if you've got it. If you're feeling

1751
01:37:14.06 --> 01:37:21.10
but the, the culture is, and it's the same in every unit. It's, it's every unit. It's like this.

1752
01:37:21.10 --> 01:37:23.90
I mean, and it's special operates every unit. It's every unit in the military.

1753
01:37:23.90 --> 01:37:31.10
Lock it up. Don't say anything. Don't go to medical. Hand like you said, handle your shit.

1754
01:37:43.10 --> 01:37:49.50
Yeah, I think the guys are just to, I, I, I don't know what they think. I don't know if they think

1755
01:37:49.50 --> 01:37:54.30
maybe this is just me. Like, what's up with me? Am I fucked up? I don't want to tell my buddies. I'm

1756
01:37:54.30 --> 01:38:00.30
might be a little fucked up. Or they don't want to hurt their service. Or they just want to

1757
01:38:00.30 --> 01:38:07.50
ignore it and hope it'll go away. They think they'll just like muscle through it. I don't know what

1758
01:38:07.50 --> 01:38:14.30
they think. But somehow we need to shift the little needle a little bit to recognize

1759
01:38:14.30 --> 01:38:22.06
is you do all this training. I mean, millions of dollars are spent on these guys. You guys to

1760
01:38:22.06 --> 01:38:28.46
train millions of dollars. And, you know, I mean, Chad was a sniper and free-falled jumpmaster and,

1761
01:38:28.46 --> 01:38:32.70
you know, name all the things. And you took the time to teach him that.

1762
01:38:35.34 --> 01:38:42.70
So why wouldn't you take the time to also teach them about maybe some ways that they're going to be

1763
01:38:42.70 --> 01:38:50.06
potentially impacted after multiple years of service? It's 2021 and right now what we're about to

1764
01:38:50.06 --> 01:38:58.62
see are people that have served their entire career post 911. So this suicide epidemic,

1765
01:38:59.34 --> 01:39:01.66
it is not going away. It's only ramping up.

1766
01:39:04.14 --> 01:39:09.74
Yeah, you know, when I, when I kind of started off talking about this, that's the connection that I

1767
01:39:09.74 --> 01:39:15.18
made as I was like listening to your story hearing it is, you know, we've made all these developments

1768
01:39:15.18 --> 01:39:21.34
and all these different wars from the problems that the wars cause, right? And yet, and I'd even

1769
01:39:21.34 --> 01:39:26.38
talk about like, like, these current wars, the prosthetics, you see the prosthetics that people have

1770
01:39:26.38 --> 01:39:31.82
now, they're amazing. You know, they can do all these incredible things. And we make these massive

1771
01:39:31.82 --> 01:39:38.54
advancements. And yet, this is just like over here in this dark corner, not really being addressed.

1772
01:39:38.54 --> 01:39:43.98
Now, I take that back. There is, there are things that are happening now that they are starting

1773
01:39:43.98 --> 01:39:47.50
to address. I know that they're doing like baseline studies of guys. I don't know what you know about

1774
01:39:47.50 --> 01:39:53.02
the stuff Jason, but they're doing like baseline studies, brain studies on guys, so they can kind of

1775
01:39:53.02 --> 01:39:58.78
tell where they're at, so they can see what kind of impact they've had over over time. So I think

1776
01:39:58.78 --> 01:40:05.34
maybe it is starting to come to light a little bit now. But certainly, I don't think the culture

1777
01:40:05.34 --> 01:40:12.86
has a big change to it yet because, I mean, it takes time to offer to change culture.

1778
01:40:12.86 --> 01:40:18.38
It would crush the recruitment process, wouldn't it? We've known for years because of history

1779
01:40:18.38 --> 01:40:23.66
and wars that when you go serve your country, there's likely how do you could die? You're choosing

1780
01:40:23.66 --> 01:40:33.82
to serve and die potentially by your flag, but it would really crush recruitment if insert army,

1781
01:40:33.82 --> 01:40:40.70
navy, whoever. And you say, hey, you want to be a seal? You want to be a green beret? You want to be a

1782
01:40:40.70 --> 01:40:43.74
and you say, you're going to come, you're going to do your service, you're going to do cool

1783
01:40:43.74 --> 01:40:47.18
shit, you're going to jump out of airplanes, you're going to shoot guns and you're going to kill bad

1784
01:40:47.18 --> 01:40:53.58
guys. And if you make it by the end of it, you might also have some pretty severe mental health issues

1785
01:40:53.58 --> 01:41:01.58
and some brain injury. Are you going to go with that? It's hard for them to pony up and say that

1786
01:41:01.58 --> 01:41:07.42
because, well, man, is that going to crush our number? I think people still show up for that.

1787
01:41:08.06 --> 01:41:12.70
I mean, it's like, is everybody, when you do this, you're like, well, I'm going to happen to me.

1788
01:41:13.82 --> 01:41:21.10
Oh, I know. I mean, I, I, other guys, not me. I did the cake of form before every

1789
01:41:21.10 --> 01:41:30.22
deployment and I was fully prepared as you can be as a spouse in the world we were living in.

1790
01:41:30.22 --> 01:41:35.82
I mean, we attended many funerals in those last 10 years that my husband might not come home.

1791
01:41:36.38 --> 01:41:40.54
And if he doesn't come home, he's going to come home and a call from with the flag over it.

1792
01:41:40.54 --> 01:42:05.58
That's not what I got. So where does it go towards the end? What do you

1793
01:42:05.58 --> 01:42:13.42
see towards the end? One of the biggest things was, well, he started putting on weight and, you

1794
01:42:13.42 --> 01:42:18.38
know, he would joke because he was over 40 and he's like, you don't love me anymore because I'm

1795
01:42:19.10 --> 01:42:25.66
getting heavy, which would never be the case. But he started running weight, but what really

1796
01:42:25.66 --> 01:42:30.86
started to happen and pretty drastically, I would say the last six months that I can look back

1797
01:42:30.86 --> 01:42:38.38
now is he got really puffy. His face got puffy almost like the sounds terrible like,

1798
01:42:38.38 --> 01:42:43.66
have you ever seen a fish in water instead and it's kind of like bloated? That's always face got.

1799
01:42:44.54 --> 01:42:52.62
And, and I, he also is weird as this is, I would always kind of kiss him on his temple and he

1800
01:42:52.62 --> 01:43:02.94
didn't smell the same. And I thought, oh, that's weird. Well, I've learned since then a lot more about

1801
01:43:02.94 --> 01:43:11.90
the way the brain's affected and to go back to that kind of systemic derailment. When you have a

1802
01:43:11.90 --> 01:43:18.94
blast injury, you know, it's, it's a wave, right? It goes through the air and basically your brain

1803
01:43:18.94 --> 01:43:23.98
shakes up inside your skull and that's what it's built to do. That's why we have a skull and that's

1804
01:43:23.98 --> 01:43:29.26
how it's made. But it's not made to get that over and over again. So when that happens and they're

1805
01:43:29.26 --> 01:43:35.98
swelling in the brain, it then starts to affect everything else because the brain is connected to the

1806
01:43:35.98 --> 01:43:44.46
rest of your body and you see where not only hormones get derail, but, you know, your metabolism gets

1807
01:43:44.46 --> 01:43:50.62
jacked up. So the guy is start to gain weight and when your metabolism gets jacked up, it also messes with

1808
01:43:50.62 --> 01:43:55.90
the ketones in your body which would be like, you know, factoring it with your urine and different

1809
01:43:55.90 --> 01:44:02.06
things and that's what changes the way they smell. And the puffiness is because we'll sure if he's

1810
01:44:02.06 --> 01:44:07.58
got brain injury and there's any swelling or there's just systemic swelling in the body,

1811
01:44:07.58 --> 01:44:15.34
it's got to go somewhere and so we start to notice it in the face and again, I didn't know any

1812
01:44:15.34 --> 01:44:20.86
of this stuff prior and that's not to say someone listening, you're sitting there and you look

1813
01:44:20.86 --> 01:44:26.06
over at your husband. You're like, my husband's face is puffy, but there's something to be said

1814
01:44:26.06 --> 01:44:37.42
that PTSD is a genuine thing. I believe I also believe it's overused a lot and this is a whole

1815
01:44:37.42 --> 01:44:46.54
step further than PTSD. Well, and also you're talking about it's not just hey, your face is

1816
01:44:46.54 --> 01:44:52.62
puffy, we have an issue. No, it's this, this, this, this, this, you add all these things together

1817
01:44:52.62 --> 01:44:58.22
and you get that many red flags. Yeah. Then that's, you know, you've got the, the, the, the, the

1818
01:44:58.22 --> 01:45:04.06
the, the, the, the, the, the, the, you smell different. Hey, you're not talking, hey,

1819
01:45:04.06 --> 01:45:08.86
you know, you're, you're, you're, you're not working out as much as you should just start adding

1820
01:45:08.86 --> 01:45:14.14
all these red flags together and it's like, okay, you know, we have, we have, we have to address this.

1821
01:45:14.14 --> 01:45:19.74
Well, and, and when you think about the different parts of the brain, you've got your, your

1822
01:45:19.74 --> 01:45:23.82
limbic brain, your monkey brain, deep inside, that's what tells you what's safe.

1823
01:45:23.82 --> 01:45:27.26
Is this dangerous? Is this why we don't walk into the street, right? We know that's dangerous.

1824
01:45:27.26 --> 01:45:35.66
The prefrontal cortex kind of is, hmm, how do I feel about that? So if, if the brain is affected,

1825
01:45:35.66 --> 01:45:42.54
that's when we see them, you know, the short fuse, how do I feel, I'm angry, I'm aggressive,

1826
01:45:42.54 --> 01:45:48.86
maybe I'm sad, different emotions, but when it's brain injury and we've heard CTE, right,

1827
01:45:48.86 --> 01:45:54.94
punch drunk, NFL players, our guys get it too. Our guys are getting interface,

1828
01:45:54.94 --> 01:46:02.38
astral glial scarring, and that's almost like think of like a ricochet, almost bullets through

1829
01:46:02.38 --> 01:46:08.46
the brain, and that's what comes from the blast injury, and that's able to penetrate that deep

1830
01:46:08.46 --> 01:46:13.98
monkey brain of like, is this safe for me? And that's why guys make decisions that are really,

1831
01:46:13.98 --> 01:46:23.10
really bad, whether it's, you know, drinking too much, um, in fidelity or, you know, I have a friend

1832
01:46:23.10 --> 01:46:33.26
who he's good now, but he had his daughter in the car and had been drinking and was

1833
01:46:34.38 --> 01:46:42.22
speeding well far above the speed limit. Any father would know, none of that is good,

1834
01:46:43.74 --> 01:46:51.74
but he wasn't able to make the right decision. So, so I started to see

1835
01:46:51.74 --> 01:47:00.54
looking back, I can see how he had changed, and I've shared with Jason to Chad

1836
01:47:02.06 --> 01:47:10.54
climbed Mount Auckland, Cogua in January and of 2018, and that's the second highest summit in

1837
01:47:10.54 --> 01:47:15.58
the world. It's the highest in South America, it's in Argentina, and he went and climbed this,

1838
01:47:15.58 --> 01:47:24.78
it's a little over 23,000 feet, and I will never know, but I do believe that him climbing that

1839
01:47:24.78 --> 01:47:33.58
mountain exacerbated any of his brain injuries that he had, and I've since talked to

1840
01:47:36.38 --> 01:47:42.62
a doctor who I respect highly. She's been studying blast injuries in Cosevo soldiers since the

1841
01:47:42.62 --> 01:47:47.90
early 90s, or at least that's who she started with, and I asked her about that, and she,

1842
01:47:48.94 --> 01:47:53.42
you know, again, she didn't test Chad's brain, but she was pretty confident that that was

1843
01:47:53.42 --> 01:47:59.34
probably the case too. Yeah, I mean, how long was that? That's going to be a couple weeks at least

1844
01:47:59.34 --> 01:48:06.78
of a three-week evolution. Yeah, and it was lack of a two-highly, stranyous. Yeah, and so now you've

1845
01:48:06.78 --> 01:48:13.98
got this brain that's injured, what encourages healing in the body blood, blood flow, right? You

1846
01:48:13.98 --> 01:48:18.14
have surgery, okay, cool, you need surgery, once you get up, once you move your knee, because we got

1847
01:48:18.14 --> 01:48:22.22
to get blood flow to it, because we're going to heal, right? Brain's injured, wait, now I'm going to

1848
01:48:22.22 --> 01:48:27.26
go up 23,000 feet, and I'm going to be without oxygen, it really needs to heal itself. Yeah,

1849
01:48:27.26 --> 01:48:35.50
one of my, um, the guys go through the hyperbaric chamber, right, which is just O2, pressure O2.

1850
01:48:35.50 --> 01:48:41.34
It's the opposite of climbing a 23,000 foot mountain, and it provides a lot of healing, a lot of healing

1851
01:48:41.34 --> 01:48:48.14
to guys. So to have to do the opposite of that, I mean, it seems. I asked her about that, and she said,

1852
01:48:48.46 --> 01:48:53.34
I said, is that something that would help, and she said, yes, but not initially after injury?

1853
01:48:53.34 --> 01:48:57.66
I mean, we're talking different things, because you're talking about guys that've been back for a while,

1854
01:48:57.66 --> 01:49:07.42
and we do see people who have a little bit exacerbated symptoms at a higher elevation. My

1855
01:49:07.42 --> 01:49:14.38
best friend's husband, they live in Colorado, and I said to the doctor, I said, what would you say,

1856
01:49:14.38 --> 01:49:22.38
if there was a 20 year Navy seal veteran who's done upwards of probably 10 deployments,

1857
01:49:22.38 --> 01:49:31.18
without a doubt, probably does have some some brain blast injury and lives at 8 to 10,000 feet,

1858
01:49:31.18 --> 01:49:35.02
and before I could even finish the sentence, she just shook her head, no, no, she's kept shaking her

1859
01:49:35.02 --> 01:49:43.02
head, no, and she said, bad, bad, very bad. I'd tell him to move. What was Chad's,

1860
01:49:44.30 --> 01:49:50.30
like debrief points on the mountain climb? What do you say about it? He said it was really hard,

1861
01:49:50.30 --> 01:49:59.98
really hard. I think he was really proud of himself for doing it, but when he came home and walked

1862
01:49:59.98 --> 01:50:06.70
in the door, I mean, he was so skinny, just, you know, what do you about lose 15, 20 pounds?

1863
01:50:06.70 --> 01:50:12.62
Probably, and he came in, and he just said, baby, that was really freaking hard,

1864
01:50:13.26 --> 01:50:18.22
and I just didn't really ever hear him say that about anything. Like, it was like, oh,

1865
01:50:18.22 --> 01:50:22.86
well, you did it, you know, a good job, and he said, didn't always next.

1866
01:50:24.94 --> 01:50:31.26
That was his plan. And when was that, that wasn't January of 2018? Yeah.

1867
01:50:33.66 --> 01:50:38.30
And how about the interactions? Like, with the kids at this point, the family, like,

1868
01:50:39.42 --> 01:50:44.38
is it, you notice, and more? Is it plateaued out?

1869
01:50:44.38 --> 01:50:49.34
Well, at this point, it's with teenagers, and I remember saying to him,

1870
01:50:50.38 --> 01:50:55.02
they don't even want to like hang out with us or be home, anything. And he's like,

1871
01:50:55.02 --> 01:51:04.46
I don't want to hang out with my parents when I was 14, 17. We did take a family trip that June of

1872
01:51:04.46 --> 01:51:13.50
2018, we went to the Grand Canyon. And again, I look back at those pictures, and he definitely was not there.

1873
01:51:13.50 --> 01:51:24.70
Like, he wasn't on the trip. You know what I mean? He was obviously there. But we stayed in a couple

1874
01:51:24.70 --> 01:51:28.78
different cities. We kind of jumped around Arizona for a while, and you know, we're staying in this

1875
01:51:28.78 --> 01:51:33.34
really nice hotel, and he didn't want to leave the room. You know, it's the Grand of its June and

1876
01:51:33.34 --> 01:51:37.82
Arizona, so it is very, very hot. But, you know, he didn't really want to come down to the pool.

1877
01:51:38.22 --> 01:51:42.38
He just wanted to sit in the room. And you're like, okay, but we're on a family vacation. And

1878
01:51:42.38 --> 01:51:51.10
one time he was sitting down by the pool, and I saw him from a distance, and he just was kind of like

1879
01:51:51.10 --> 01:51:57.74
leaned over in the chair, just like zoned in out. He was just not there. And I said, I walked up. I said,

1880
01:51:57.74 --> 01:52:04.14
hey, what are you doing? He's like, nothing. Just, yeah, just things like that. He just wasn't,

1881
01:52:04.14 --> 01:52:20.54
I don't know what he was thinking about. So where's the go from there?

1882
01:52:20.54 --> 01:52:35.90
Well, and in the timeline? Yeah. Yeah. So he, he this year in 2018, I think, is when it started. He switched

1883
01:52:35.90 --> 01:52:46.30
squadron, so he was moving around within the command. And he, he said that he didn't think that

1884
01:52:46.30 --> 01:52:51.42
this is what he was supposed to be doing. I remember him saying, I just, I don't think this is right.

1885
01:52:51.42 --> 01:52:56.86
I don't think this is really the path I'm supposed to be on. And again, he didn't really share a lot with me.

1886
01:52:57.66 --> 01:53:04.46
And he, and I said, well, you're someone who's always accomplished every goal you've ever set for

1887
01:53:04.46 --> 01:53:11.18
yourself. You make a goal. You go do it. So he had this goal for himself. He had, was in the process.

1888
01:53:11.18 --> 01:53:16.94
I guess, of attaining the goal. And I said, maybe this is just the first time you change your mind.

1889
01:53:16.94 --> 01:53:20.78
Like, you just don't want to do it. That's okay. You can, you can decide to change your mind. And

1890
01:53:21.10 --> 01:53:26.78
he was like, well, they've spent so much time and money on, on doing this. And again, he didn't

1891
01:53:26.78 --> 01:53:30.22
tell me any details. And he said he goes, I know I'm not really telling you much, but it makes me feel

1892
01:53:30.22 --> 01:53:34.70
good to talk about it. And I was like, okay, because if he's gunna talk, I'm going to listen.

1893
01:53:34.70 --> 01:53:43.18
And yeah, so something was bugging him. And I don't, I don't know what, but something was really

1894
01:53:43.18 --> 01:53:51.02
bugging him. And at the beginning of October, he started hanging up his awards and things in the

1895
01:53:51.02 --> 01:53:57.90
house, which he never did before. So we had, you know, like a lot of guys, he'll plaques and awards

1896
01:53:57.90 --> 01:54:04.78
and he has a silver star and a maybe Marine Corps medal and a bronze star and all the things.

1897
01:54:05.82 --> 01:54:11.98
And we had them all framed years ago, but he never hung them up. And he just thought it was really

1898
01:54:11.98 --> 01:54:16.54
weird to hang that stuff up in your house. Because he said, what's someone's going to come in the house.

1899
01:54:16.54 --> 01:54:22.46
And it's just like, look at me. And I always thought that was weird that he had to struggle with that.

1900
01:54:22.46 --> 01:54:30.30
But yeah, he hung him up in our stairwell to our house. So maybe like you and your wife,

1901
01:54:30.30 --> 01:54:37.34
marriage is a compromise, right? And I thought, you know, almost no one comes in our house anyway.

1902
01:54:37.34 --> 01:54:42.46
And if someone were to come in our house, the only way they would see him is if they went up our stairs

1903
01:54:42.46 --> 01:54:47.90
basically to our bedrooms. But in my mind, I just thought, well, at least he's hanging him up,

1904
01:54:47.90 --> 01:54:54.86
so they're not going to get like broken or busted or anything. And he talked about hanging a

1905
01:54:54.86 --> 01:55:02.94
Somali flag on one wall, what you would have seen when you come in the front door. And I just

1906
01:55:02.94 --> 01:55:09.02
remember thinking, that's so weird. And I thought he was really messing with me. And when I turned

1907
01:55:09.02 --> 01:55:14.46
around to kind of laugh, I realized he was serious. He was dead serious. And he was like, yeah, I guess that's

1908
01:55:14.46 --> 01:55:23.18
dumb, huh? And I was like, well, maybe I asked him if he was okay. I remember kneeling down in

1909
01:55:23.18 --> 01:55:32.30
front of Elman, I said, are you okay? And he said, yeah, okay. But if there was any sort of

1910
01:55:34.06 --> 01:55:42.06
like first feeling, it was like he's off. I would have never thought three weeks later, he would

1911
01:55:42.06 --> 01:55:50.78
take his life, but that's what happened. So it's interesting. And while I, I won't share

1912
01:55:50.78 --> 01:55:59.66
her story, I, my other girlfriend will tell you who knew that her husband was struggling about

1913
01:55:59.66 --> 01:56:07.98
two months prior. There was just like a switch. Two months and he was gone. So for me, I think it was

1914
01:56:07.98 --> 01:56:15.90
three weeks and he was gone. I think they just meet this like threshold. And I don't know how we

1915
01:56:15.90 --> 01:56:24.94
figure out where that is. That's going to be half to left to scientists. But, but there is some

1916
01:56:24.94 --> 01:56:33.10
threshold that happens and then the switch is flipped. And it's still going to work. I mean,

1917
01:56:33.10 --> 01:56:39.02
this, you kneeled down in front of them. You say, are you okay? He says, yeah, do you buy it?

1918
01:56:41.58 --> 01:56:47.82
You want to buy it? I did buy it. And this again is one of those post-death struggles

1919
01:56:49.18 --> 01:56:56.46
when someone takes their life, you military or not. You are left with so many questions. And I think

1920
01:56:56.46 --> 01:57:09.18
that's, that's the beast to not have answers. And I believed him because there is nothing I didn't tell

1921
01:57:09.18 --> 01:57:18.06
him. So I believed that if there was something he needed to tell me, he would tell me.

1922
01:57:20.70 --> 01:57:25.42
And then he goes into work. Yeah. He went into work. He had a, he had a, he had a work trip three

1923
01:57:25.42 --> 01:57:31.02
week before. This is when he gets really weird. So he had a work trip. And he could drive there.

1924
01:57:31.02 --> 01:57:35.58
And he was supposed to come home on a Friday. And he called me on a Thursday. They had used

1925
01:57:35.58 --> 01:57:40.70
rental cars to go up there. And he said, hey, I'm coming home early. Can you pick me up

1926
01:57:41.74 --> 01:57:49.50
from the rental car place, forever? And I was like, oh, okay. And pick him up. He,

1927
01:57:49.50 --> 01:57:57.50
we had to take her, I had to go get my son from a football game. So I drive him back home. And he

1928
01:57:57.50 --> 01:58:02.54
instantly comes in the house. So Chad had been doing had had a concealed carry license. And he'd been

1929
01:58:03.58 --> 01:58:08.54
roll him with a concealed carry, you know, when he's home around town for probably the last year or

1930
01:58:08.54 --> 01:58:15.18
two. And again, I didn't really think much of it because I mean, well, crap is a team guy. And

1931
01:58:15.18 --> 01:58:23.66
this is America. So we come home and he instantly goes to the safe and gets his gun. And I said,

1932
01:58:23.66 --> 01:58:28.70
it was just kind of frantic. And I said, you realize that we're going on a school to pick up

1933
01:58:28.70 --> 01:58:34.46
cuts. And he said, I'm not getting out of the car. And it was very like short. And I was like, okay.

1934
01:58:35.02 --> 01:58:42.78
So we go, no big deal. In the whole time he's in the cities, just like, he just seemed uncomfortable.

1935
01:58:42.78 --> 01:58:50.54
Um, I learned later that, and I don't know any details of whatever he was doing, but he was in a

1936
01:58:50.54 --> 01:59:00.30
course, and he withdrew from the course. I he never quit anything. He never like stepped down from

1937
01:59:00.30 --> 01:59:07.82
anything I'd ever known. So that conversation about, I'm not sure I'm doing what I'm supposed to be doing.

1938
01:59:07.82 --> 01:59:18.46
That came later that night when he got home. And this was on a Thursday. And on Friday, I had to leave

1939
01:59:18.46 --> 01:59:25.18
to go. I was working out in Raleigh. I could drive there for a seminar. Across it seminar. Yeah.

1940
01:59:25.18 --> 01:59:31.66
And we talked about it that he needed to call his doctor because he felt like he just needed to check in,

1941
01:59:31.66 --> 01:59:35.98
like maybe his testosterone was off. Maybe he's something. He's like, he wasn't feeling good.

1942
01:59:35.98 --> 01:59:40.30
Earlier that week, he told me that he had some headaches and like some stomach aches. He had said he

1943
01:59:40.30 --> 01:59:47.50
didn't feel good, which again, Chad never said. I mean, I don't know if ever he said, I don't feel good.

1944
01:59:47.50 --> 01:59:51.10
I mean, he didn't say it like that, but he would never say that to me. But he did. He didn't feel good.

1945
01:59:51.66 --> 01:59:55.90
And so the deal was when I left, he was going to make an appointment with his doctor and he was

1946
01:59:55.90 --> 02:00:01.34
going to make an appointment to talk to his boss about whatever his work situation was to try to

1947
02:00:01.34 --> 02:00:08.54
figure out what his path was going to be. And I left. I told our kids, hey, you know, dad's kind

1948
02:00:08.54 --> 02:00:14.38
of stressed out just just saying, no, he's got a lot on his plate right now. And when I left,

1949
02:00:14.38 --> 02:00:19.98
I'm leaving Virginia Beach and I just had this like gut and like pit in my stomach. Like I just

1950
02:00:19.98 --> 02:00:30.06
felt like I shouldn't be leaving him. But I did. And went to Raleigh, worked, talked him on Saturday.

1951
02:00:30.06 --> 02:00:37.74
And on Sunday, kids like called and said that dad's acting really weird and he's just laying

1952
02:00:37.74 --> 02:00:49.26
on the landing and he's just staring at the ceiling. And I just, I just, that's just weird.

1953
02:00:50.54 --> 02:00:56.86
That's just weird. And I was for his way and I had to work still full seminar and

1954
02:00:56.86 --> 02:01:09.98
I just knew I had to get home. So the seminar finishes and I get in the car as quick as I can

1955
02:01:09.98 --> 02:01:16.70
and try to raise home and he called me at one point and he just said, I love you. And I kind of

1956
02:01:16.70 --> 02:01:23.74
laughed at him and I said, I love you too. And he's like, no, I mean, I really love you. I love you so much.

1957
02:01:23.74 --> 02:01:30.38
I love you so much, Sarah. And he knew I loved it when he would say my name. And I said, you know,

1958
02:01:30.38 --> 02:01:35.26
I love you too, but can I call you back? I really bad headache. And honestly, I was just really

1959
02:01:35.26 --> 02:01:42.30
trying to get home. So fast forward a couple hours later, I get home and I go in the house and

1960
02:01:43.82 --> 02:01:50.06
he's upstairs and he's rummaging below the bed for something and I come in and he turns to me

1961
02:01:50.06 --> 02:02:00.14
and I hug him and kiss him and he kind of just like, like, collapses in my arms a little bit.

1962
02:02:00.14 --> 02:02:07.34
So I just hug him for a second and I just think of my mind, well, I'm home now. So I'm near you.

1963
02:02:07.34 --> 02:02:13.26
And I'm going to try to just, I didn't think at the time that I needed to necessarily keep you safe.

1964
02:02:13.26 --> 02:02:22.46
I thought I just had to keep you close and make you feel better. And so I got, I had to get a shower

1965
02:02:22.46 --> 02:02:26.14
and I said, come talk to me while I'm in the shower. And when I went around in the bathroom to start the

1966
02:02:26.14 --> 02:02:32.38
shower, he wasn't right behind me and I looked out the door and he had just like collapsed like face

1967
02:02:32.38 --> 02:02:36.46
first on the bed, kind of like the letter T, like arms out to the side, has his head just

1968
02:02:36.46 --> 02:02:43.18
side like, like just exhaustion. And I said, what what are you doing? Come on, come in. And so I

1969
02:02:43.18 --> 02:02:50.86
get in the shower and he's sitting on the bathtub and he just had been over and he's got his hands on

1970
02:02:50.86 --> 02:02:55.74
either side of his head and he's holding this hair and he's kind of like gripping his hair and

1971
02:02:55.74 --> 02:03:01.34
I kept saying what's wrong, you know, what's going on and he got to talk to me and he just kept

1972
02:03:01.34 --> 02:03:12.14
saying I don't know. Anyway, I asked him to pass me a towel and he looked at me and he was not.

1973
02:03:13.98 --> 02:03:19.50
He wasn't there. His eyes were just like, I was just like looking straight through his eyes.

1974
02:03:20.70 --> 02:03:26.06
And I just lay down with him and bed and I just thought if I could keep him next to me then

1975
02:03:26.06 --> 02:03:36.14
he would feel better. But that wasn't the case. So I woke up in the middle of the night and he was

1976
02:03:36.14 --> 02:03:43.98
standing there dressed looking out the window and I said what are you doing? And he just said,

1977
02:03:43.98 --> 02:03:52.78
I don't know. I said, well, come lay back and bed with me and he did and the next morning,

1978
02:03:52.78 --> 02:04:00.38
early, I woke up. I woke up to see just him walking out the door. I saw like the back of his shoulder

1979
02:04:01.10 --> 02:04:11.10
leave leave. And I, I, it's like I couldn't talk. It was like I couldn't get up. I don't know if it's

1980
02:04:11.10 --> 02:04:16.86
just because I was sleepy or what or I wasn't really processing like, oh, he's leaving right now

1981
02:04:16.86 --> 02:04:24.30
and then I couldn't find him. So I woke up, you know, a little while later I couldn't find him.

1982
02:04:25.10 --> 02:04:31.82
So I looked around and I thought, well, maybe he went for a walk. Maybe he went for a run.

1983
02:04:31.82 --> 02:04:36.22
Maybe he went to go get coffee. How did I call him? He didn't answer. I texted him. He didn't answer.

1984
02:04:38.38 --> 02:04:44.86
And went round in my head trying to figure out where it could be. I got in my car at one point.

1985
02:04:44.86 --> 02:04:49.66
I thought I'll drive around and then I thought, where am I? Where literally, like which direction would I drive?

1986
02:04:49.66 --> 02:04:53.18
What's happening? Thought, well, did he leave for work? You supposed to leave on a work trip?

1987
02:04:54.14 --> 02:05:00.38
But I figured he was also going to talk to his boss. So, you know, did he go to work? I just didn't know.

1988
02:05:01.02 --> 02:05:07.50
I called his dad. But because he was so weird the night before I just thought it was weird that he left and he didn't

1989
02:05:07.50 --> 02:05:15.18
say bye. He never didn't not kiss me goodbye. Never. He actually would do this. I'd be upstairs and he'd say,

1990
02:05:15.18 --> 02:05:19.34
okay, bye. I'll see you later and he would slam a door in the house just to see me

1991
02:05:20.14 --> 02:05:26.54
run down furiously down the steps because he knew I would get so spun up if he left and didn't kiss me.

1992
02:05:26.54 --> 02:05:39.50
So, I don't know what I was thinking. I just know I wanted I just wanted confirmation of where he was

1993
02:05:40.30 --> 02:05:47.26
and I finally called the command and I talked to the psych there and

1994
02:05:47.26 --> 02:05:56.94
she asked me a bunch of questions. One of the questions she asked was how does he feel about

1995
02:05:57.74 --> 02:06:03.74
and he asked he said chat's boss's name and I felt that was a really weird question

1996
02:06:06.38 --> 02:06:11.58
because another thing I really loved about chat is he really never said anything bad about people.

1997
02:06:11.58 --> 02:06:18.86
So, you know, if he liked you or didn't like you, I didn't really know. That's how he walked and

1998
02:06:19.66 --> 02:06:30.22
I was like, I have no idea. But she, she just kind of let me think he's on his way to work.

1999
02:06:30.22 --> 02:06:34.86
You know, like he's probably left and he's on the straining trip and a little while later I

2000
02:06:34.86 --> 02:06:39.34
had talked to her again and I said, you know, everything's here. His toothbrush is here. His medicine

2001
02:06:39.34 --> 02:06:45.02
is here. His sunglasses are here. He wouldn't leave with all that stuff and she told me

2002
02:06:46.54 --> 02:06:51.02
due to the privacy of his job. It would be likely that he wouldn't be answering his cell phone.

2003
02:06:53.02 --> 02:07:03.02
And I said, okay, so like the wife that I was, I kind of just thought, okay, so he must have gone

2004
02:07:03.02 --> 02:07:07.82
and it was driving trip up the coast a little bit. So I thought, okay, he was supposed to be back the next day

2005
02:07:07.82 --> 02:07:19.58
and so I think about that and my kids came home from school that day and they said, where's dad?

2006
02:07:20.38 --> 02:07:24.54
And I said, oh, I don't know. I think he left on this work trip. He should be home tomorrow. And I'm

2007
02:07:24.54 --> 02:07:29.90
saying that almost feeling like I'm lying because I don't believe it. But I'm trying to believe it

2008
02:07:29.90 --> 02:07:40.54
because that's what I was told and why wouldn't you, right? So this point, you know, he disappears

2009
02:07:40.54 --> 02:07:49.34
Monday morning, probably I'm saying somewhere between three and six AM and Monday goes by,

2010
02:07:49.34 --> 02:07:55.42
we started demolition on our house. We were doing renovations. That started that day and Tuesday

2011
02:07:55.42 --> 02:08:03.34
comes and I went my house sits near a lake. You can see it from my front porch and I went for a run

2012
02:08:05.18 --> 02:08:10.86
and this is why I'm sharing it. It'll make sense in a minute. But I went for a run and I ran past the

2013
02:08:10.86 --> 02:08:15.26
lake down the bike path all around and I was going to sit at the lake from an end of October.

2014
02:08:15.26 --> 02:08:20.14
It's Virginia Beach. The weather was really beautiful that day and I was going to sit on the bench

2015
02:08:20.14 --> 02:08:26.54
at that lake. But I didn't because I wanted to go inside and shower and like curl my hair and look

2016
02:08:26.54 --> 02:08:33.82
nice for winning at home. So I did that and dropped my son off at a friend's house. He's going to play

2017
02:08:34.30 --> 02:08:39.82
going to a football game. And as I was pulling back in, a psych from work called and said,

2018
02:08:39.82 --> 02:08:47.42
ma'am, your husband didn't report to a master. We're heightening the alert. And I said, that's bad.

2019
02:08:47.42 --> 02:08:53.18
That's bad. That's very bad. And I pretty sure I hung up the phone on him. And when I got out of my car,

2020
02:08:53.18 --> 02:09:02.70
so now where my car was, it's in this coldest acne or buy and it's facing that lake and my house

2021
02:09:02.70 --> 02:09:07.98
is on the left and as I'm walking up to my house, the head contractor for the renovations comes out

2022
02:09:07.98 --> 02:09:11.58
and he says, ma'am, there's two police officers at your back door.

2023
02:09:11.58 --> 02:09:25.50
I called my best friend Courtney, her husband and my husband were in Buds together. And I said,

2024
02:09:26.06 --> 02:09:35.50
you need to come to my house right now. And I just hung up phone. And I didn't know what was going

2025
02:09:35.50 --> 02:09:41.50
on. I just thought something is like seriously. And I went in my front door and out my back door

2026
02:09:41.50 --> 02:09:47.34
the way the house is and there were two cops in my garage and they were, we stood outside the door

2027
02:09:47.34 --> 02:09:54.30
and they said, ma'am, do you know where your husband is? And I said, no, I can't find him and I haven't

2028
02:09:54.30 --> 02:09:59.74
been able to find him. And I asked him if they could move farther down into the street because we were

2029
02:09:59.74 --> 02:10:05.98
right underneath my daughter's window and I knew that she was upstairs and I just didn't want her to be.

2030
02:10:06.54 --> 02:10:13.42
I just didn't know what was happening. So we moved on to the street and

2031
02:10:18.30 --> 02:10:25.50
this cop just opens his door and he like dig something and I have this car and he just turned

2032
02:10:25.50 --> 02:10:30.14
the police. And he said, ma'am, I'm really sorry to tell you but we found your husband and he took his life.

2033
02:10:35.90 --> 02:10:37.18
And now is all alone.

2034
02:10:42.46 --> 02:10:44.30
So, right, right.

2035
02:10:44.30 --> 02:10:55.02
I ran about that time. Courtney pulled up. Sorry. Sorry.

2036
02:10:59.26 --> 02:11:06.38
Courtney pulled up and I think I was screaming and she bare hugged me from behind and I think

2037
02:11:06.38 --> 02:11:13.50
we pretty much took her to the ground, I think. And she said, you don't know that. So she screamed at him.

2038
02:11:13.50 --> 02:11:22.38
You don't know that. Well, he's taken his life at that lake and he could see her house from where he was.

2039
02:11:23.98 --> 02:11:37.98
At least that's what they tell me. So, my daughter's upstairs in her room by herself and she can see

2040
02:11:37.98 --> 02:11:45.74
in here everything. And my son is at a friend's house and I think pretty sure my neighbor went to pick him up.

2041
02:11:47.02 --> 02:12:07.26
So he told me son. So, I have to understand like logistically speaking, there's a lot of things that just

2042
02:12:07.26 --> 02:12:18.30
don't make sense. Where my car was when I got out of it and that guy said the cops were at the back door.

2043
02:12:20.54 --> 02:12:26.22
If they had just found his body, I didn't see anybody over by that lake.

2044
02:12:26.22 --> 02:12:44.22
It had been like 36 hours since I couldn't find them. We went back later and I do think he was at the lake.

2045
02:12:44.22 --> 02:12:50.94
And this is why we went back later in our neighborhood so many people have cameras on their house

2046
02:12:50.94 --> 02:13:01.42
and there's footage of Chad and the bike path that lines that lake if you walk to it at kind of T's and if you go left

2047
02:13:01.42 --> 02:13:10.14
it takes you all the way up to the main road that cars go in and out of the neighborhood. And I think we timed it so that

2048
02:13:10.14 --> 02:13:21.34
cameras caught him walking that way and that would have been right at the same time he would have watched our kids leave for school.

2049
02:13:27.42 --> 02:13:39.74
So, when um, when this is happening, when this is getting like, when when when

2050
02:13:39.74 --> 02:13:46.62
he leaves in the morning and you start thinking like where is he? Is there any part of your brain that's thinking

2051
02:13:46.62 --> 02:13:51.66
he could kill himself? No. So, well, I take that back.

2052
02:13:51.66 --> 02:14:08.06
I did ask Chad's dad. I was trying to get into the safe. So, I guess there was a part of me that did but

2053
02:14:10.54 --> 02:14:14.94
this, he, this was a little farther on in the morning. So, when I first couldn't find him I just

2054
02:14:14.94 --> 02:14:19.82
couldn't find up in the napkin or a while, I think it might have been his dad that said have you checked the

2055
02:14:19.82 --> 02:14:29.58
safe? And so, it took me a minute to try to remember the combo and I got in there and to my knowledge

2056
02:14:29.58 --> 02:14:38.46
all the guns were there but apparently they weren't. I guess the reason I'm asking you that is because

2057
02:14:39.90 --> 02:14:45.18
I don't know various conversations in my, I've had in my life with various people at various times

2058
02:14:45.18 --> 02:14:52.94
and the conversation is something like, you know, you know, that little exploration of

2059
02:14:54.14 --> 02:14:59.82
wait, I'm worried about him and then there'll be some kind of an explanation like,

2060
02:15:00.78 --> 02:15:08.94
what do you mean? Well, I'm just worried like he might kill himself and then the conversation is

2061
02:15:08.94 --> 02:15:19.02
he would never do that. Right? So, that idea of we think we know, we think we know what someone's

2062
02:15:19.02 --> 02:15:26.06
going through, we think we know what's going on in their heads and I think that we don't know,

2063
02:15:26.06 --> 02:15:34.30
we don't always know and, you know, like, he disappears, you know, like what, that's what I was

2064
02:15:34.30 --> 02:15:40.78
just thinking like, what was that in your head of like, hey, you know what, he's, you know, he

2065
02:15:40.78 --> 02:15:45.66
probably is going to see his parents or he's, you know, going to go freaking surfing or whatever he's

2066
02:15:45.66 --> 02:15:58.22
going to do but this crazy idea that he might go kill himself. It seems so unbelievable, you know,

2067
02:15:59.10 --> 02:16:03.42
for someone that's like, hey, he's been through whatever, 10 deployments. He's done all this.

2068
02:16:03.42 --> 02:16:07.74
He's done this. He's done that. We got kids. We got a house. We got all these things going on. All these

2069
02:16:07.74 --> 02:16:14.38
good things going on in our lives. That's not, that's not going to happen. And it seems like

2070
02:16:14.38 --> 02:16:21.02
oftentimes people are caught off guard by it. People are caught off guard and I know you mentioned a

2071
02:16:21.02 --> 02:16:28.38
couple of friends where there was real signs of, you know, hey, not things aren't going good for

2072
02:16:28.38 --> 02:16:34.38
the individual but a lot of times I hear it's like, you know, there's been some suicides in the

2073
02:16:34.38 --> 02:16:47.50
seal community where there was no indication at all, at all of any kind. And it seems like we're

2074
02:16:47.50 --> 02:17:05.42
conditioned to sort of not even think that it's a feasible thing. I, guilt. I, you know, I was just as bad as,

2075
02:17:07.10 --> 02:17:15.42
as the military makes the guys out to be because as I said in his funeral,

2076
02:17:15.42 --> 02:17:28.38
to me, Chad was unbreakable. I mean, to me, he had done all these really amazing things in

2077
02:17:28.38 --> 02:17:38.14
his life. He, he's, you know, he, everything he did, he did well, everything he did. And

2078
02:17:38.14 --> 02:17:45.26
it's seal, you know, great ridiculous high GPA when he's going night school and he has a life and a

2079
02:17:45.26 --> 02:17:52.70
baby and really good in sniper school and went and got his project manager license certification,

2080
02:17:52.70 --> 02:17:58.62
all that in the business world. And whatever, fill in the blank, climbing mountains,

2081
02:17:59.42 --> 02:18:07.02
qualifying for the CrossFit games, like insert whatever, he just was so unbreakable to me. And,

2082
02:18:07.02 --> 02:18:16.38
and I guess that's part of my, what I want people to recognize with your person is that

2083
02:18:17.74 --> 02:18:23.74
they are, they're Navy seals, but at the end of the day, you're just dudes, you know, your dudes,

2084
02:18:23.74 --> 02:18:37.66
and humans, and with heart and conscience and dads and husbands and brothers and sons and, um,

2085
02:18:37.98 --> 02:18:43.74
not unbreakable.

2086
02:18:43.74 --> 02:18:50.14
So, I'm a book written by a guy named David Hackworth who is a Vietnam Korean War veteran and one of

2087
02:18:50.14 --> 02:18:55.10
the things that he talks about is the fact that like people are different, right? And as you mentioned,

2088
02:18:55.10 --> 02:19:00.06
people are different and something's in fact different people different ways and he described like

2089
02:19:00.06 --> 02:19:06.70
there's a cop that people have and, and when it gets filled up with like the stress and the trauma,

2090
02:19:08.46 --> 02:19:15.26
once it overflows like that's it. If you, if it overflows, that's it, like you, that's it. And

2091
02:19:15.26 --> 02:19:20.30
different people have different sized cops and some people got a freaking five gallon jug and some

2092
02:19:20.30 --> 02:19:29.18
people got a tea cup and everything in between and I compare that to another war veteran, Dick Winners,

2093
02:19:29.18 --> 02:19:36.30
who is the character of Bandar Brothers, he was saying that, but he's got a book about about war as well

2094
02:19:37.02 --> 02:19:42.86
and his big thing was like, when that cop, they use a different metaphor, but

2095
02:19:42.86 --> 02:19:49.18
when the cop starts to get filled up, you need to get the person out of a situation and if you

2096
02:19:49.18 --> 02:19:56.06
get him out of the situation, the cop like the the water will dissipate and it'll go back down

2097
02:19:56.06 --> 02:20:01.50
and they can continue, they can go back, they can continue to perform their job. But same thing,

2098
02:20:01.50 --> 02:20:08.30
if you let the cop overflow, then it's, it's, it's, can't you can't put the water back in there.

2099
02:20:08.30 --> 02:20:13.18
You know, I always talk, when I talk to people about this kind of stuff, I talk about the

2100
02:20:13.18 --> 02:20:19.26
check engine light in a car, right? If the check engine light comes on, you take it in for a service.

2101
02:20:19.26 --> 02:20:24.22
You stop driving it and as long as you take it in for a service and it gets some downtime

2102
02:20:24.22 --> 02:20:28.38
and the engine cools and you put in fresh oil, whatever the engine is going to be okay.

2103
02:20:29.26 --> 02:20:32.94
But if the check engine light comes on and you just keep running that engine,

2104
02:20:32.94 --> 02:20:40.78
you're going to burn that engine out and you'll destroy the engine. And you know, I think that

2105
02:20:40.78 --> 02:20:45.50
all these things come into play and that's what makes this so difficult is everyone's just got

2106
02:20:45.50 --> 02:20:50.38
a different size cup and everyone's got a different time that they're check engine light comes on

2107
02:20:50.38 --> 02:20:55.42
and how much it's going to take to get that thing cooled back down and it makes it, it makes it so

2108
02:20:55.42 --> 02:21:02.38
challenging to universally say, okay, well here's the limitation that people have. So I think what

2109
02:21:02.38 --> 02:21:09.18
you're doing, talking about how to identify that check engine light so people can see it.

2110
02:21:10.30 --> 02:21:18.38
And then also trying to help people to recognize that you've got to kind of, you've got to do

2111
02:21:18.38 --> 02:21:21.82
your best to see your own check engine light and when that freaking thing comes on,

2112
02:21:22.70 --> 02:21:25.74
you've got to do something about it. And if you don't do something about it,

2113
02:21:25.74 --> 02:21:27.90
you're going to blow out the engine and then you're no good.

2114
02:21:27.90 --> 02:21:37.58
Yeah, and as we've said a couple times that the guys don't want to worry the spouse or I say

2115
02:21:37.58 --> 02:21:43.42
spouse or first responder like who's who is your go-to person, right? They don't want to worry the

2116
02:21:43.42 --> 02:21:51.42
spouse, but if I were to ask someone that was struggling right now, maybe they're sitting there

2117
02:21:51.42 --> 02:21:56.22
and they're they thought about taking their life and they say, I don't want to bother my spouse. I don't

2118
02:21:56.22 --> 02:22:02.70
I would it would be better for her if I wasn't here and I can't speak to the relationships that

2119
02:22:02.70 --> 02:22:10.14
people have, but sitting on this side of it, sorry, I didn't like total cry or today.

2120
02:22:11.90 --> 02:22:22.22
He didn't even give me the chance to help. That hurts. So it's on one hand you can say,

2121
02:22:22.22 --> 02:22:29.26
well he didn't want to burden you, you know, he just he didn't want to cause you any worry,

2122
02:22:29.26 --> 02:22:35.98
but I mean look at where I am now. Did he not think that this wouldn't like devastate me forever?

2123
02:22:36.54 --> 02:22:39.66
He didn't even give me the opportunity to like try to help.

2124
02:22:41.50 --> 02:22:51.34
You know, Jacob, the hard part comes in when you've got guys who you're your bread not to talk about this

2125
02:22:51.34 --> 02:22:57.90
stuff. It is constantly bread and the interesting part for me in this journey of learning

2126
02:22:59.02 --> 02:23:04.30
Chad's story and my wife Emily and I get into to know Sarah and her family really well and

2127
02:23:04.30 --> 02:23:11.58
going really into this issue is there's actually something that happens to your brain, right? This

2128
02:23:11.58 --> 02:23:21.66
is not something where it's not like, oh, you know, I've just got this inexplicable weakness going on

2129
02:23:21.66 --> 02:23:26.38
because that's what it is in the teams, right? It's like, oh that dude's weak if he goes and does this.

2130
02:23:27.26 --> 02:23:34.46
And you know, but if you blow your back out or if you, you know, you get shot or if you do,

2131
02:23:34.46 --> 02:23:42.38
you know, things that are acceptable injuries, you know, by team room standards of sorts, right?

2132
02:23:43.10 --> 02:23:49.98
And the thing that's like, my best friend and basic training killed himself and I didn't unpack

2133
02:23:49.98 --> 02:23:56.94
that at all, right? I mean his dad was a general and that was something that in my training,

2134
02:23:56.94 --> 02:24:03.82
it's just, you know, I couldn't sit and think about this at all. It's like days of thunder, right?

2135
02:24:03.82 --> 02:24:10.30
When, you know, coal gets, Tom Cruise gets injured, right? I mean the injured driver goes way over there

2136
02:24:10.30 --> 02:24:16.86
and nobody ever wants to be around them. And for me personally, I had to just kind of take that and say,

2137
02:24:16.86 --> 02:24:23.26
all right, I have a job to do and he was weak. Good friend of mine and he just, that's that could happen

2138
02:24:23.26 --> 02:24:29.50
to him and there's something, what I told myself was there's something that he was born with

2139
02:24:29.50 --> 02:24:35.82
that made him do that and this just kind of brought it to life. And when you hear Chad's story,

2140
02:24:35.82 --> 02:24:41.50
if you think that you didn't hear the story, because, you know, that's the word of caution to the

2141
02:24:41.50 --> 02:24:47.98
guys and our profession and to millions of Americans out there, right? The, this idea that

2142
02:24:49.98 --> 02:24:55.02
you're born with this or you're not, I mean situation brought this, brought this out, right?

2143
02:24:55.02 --> 02:25:02.30
It's chronic stress, chronic pain going on from injuries and just the way that you train,

2144
02:25:02.30 --> 02:25:08.38
the way that, I mean it takes its toll and then that leads to all sorts of things and, you know,

2145
02:25:08.38 --> 02:25:13.34
the brain is something that we don't really study that well. We don't study it much at all and,

2146
02:25:13.34 --> 02:25:19.26
you know, it's one of those things where we're able to, you know, cure this virus almost a year

2147
02:25:19.26 --> 02:25:25.18
later with a huge national surge because we give a shit in the matters and this is something

2148
02:25:25.18 --> 02:25:31.58
that is just kind of still floating around over here. I mean, what's it going to take? We're losing

2149
02:25:31.58 --> 02:25:38.54
our, some of our most valuable people in our country, right, to, to something that we just don't

2150
02:25:38.54 --> 02:25:43.98
understand. But what I know, my mental shift is to say there wasn't one that of weakness in Chad

2151
02:25:43.98 --> 02:25:49.02
Wilkinson. There was something that is inexplicable that we just have not explained yet that,

2152
02:25:49.02 --> 02:25:56.46
that changed inside of him and some decision-making process, you know, it just, it changed

2153
02:25:57.50 --> 02:26:02.94
and we have a long ways to go. Yeah, there's a famous football player from San Diego,

2154
02:26:02.94 --> 02:26:09.90
a guy named Junior Sayow, have you heard of him? Oh yeah, like the most beloved, probably San Diego

2155
02:26:09.90 --> 02:26:16.86
charger, maybe even the most beloved San Diego athlete, total stud, you know, a beast of a human,

2156
02:26:18.06 --> 02:26:23.82
like a super nice guy. He was just, just this incredible human being. He returned from the

2157
02:26:23.82 --> 02:26:32.46
NFL and killed himself. Like he had everything and, you know, that, that, that made me think of this,

2158
02:26:32.46 --> 02:26:39.42
you know, Sarah, when you're like talking about Chad and when I've talked to people that,

2159
02:26:40.62 --> 02:26:49.42
like our art depressed, straight up depressed, their heads in, in like this, their heads in a

2160
02:26:49.42 --> 02:26:54.06
storm, their heads in like darkness and, and it's really like from the outside,

2161
02:26:55.02 --> 02:26:59.26
you look at him and you think, oh yeah, well, hey, man, it's, you know, you're in this bad situation,

2162
02:26:59.26 --> 02:27:03.82
but it's only, it's only just right around you and if you come over here a little bit,

2163
02:27:03.82 --> 02:27:10.14
you'll be out of the storm, like, come on over, but from their perspective, no matter where they look,

2164
02:27:10.14 --> 02:27:16.78
it's like darkness and they just see the storm and they don't see that if they can move forward

2165
02:27:16.78 --> 02:27:21.34
more, they can go a little bit further and they don't see that everybody's on the outside going,

2166
02:27:21.34 --> 02:27:26.62
hey, like, it's okay, man, it's super sunny and bright and like there's a rainbow over here and

2167
02:27:26.62 --> 02:27:33.26
everything's cool, just, just, just move over here a little bit and they can't, they, they don't see it,

2168
02:27:33.26 --> 02:27:36.86
they don't see it, they can't see it, they can't see it because it's there, that's what they're,

2169
02:27:36.86 --> 02:27:42.54
that's what's around them and so like, it just causes them to do things that don't make any sense to

2170
02:27:42.54 --> 02:27:47.82
us because we're looking at him from the outside going, hey, like, no, it's sunny, it's sunny,

2171
02:27:47.82 --> 02:27:55.82
and they can't see it and it's like trying to convince people, it's almost impossible, it seems

2172
02:27:55.82 --> 02:28:03.98
almost impossible to try and convince someone that that storm that they see 360 degrees around them,

2173
02:28:03.98 --> 02:28:10.22
thunder, lightning, winds, that's what they see and to convince them that hey, man, right over here,

2174
02:28:11.18 --> 02:28:15.58
it's sunny and it's nice beach day and it's 80 degrees and we're gonna, it's okay,

2175
02:28:18.14 --> 02:28:25.66
they, they can't see it and it's so hard to get them out of that cloud and

2176
02:28:25.66 --> 02:28:32.22
I think that's where people get stuck and it's so frustrating from the outside because

2177
02:28:34.38 --> 02:28:38.94
we can see all that other good stuff that they just don't have the ability to see anymore.

2178
02:28:38.94 --> 02:28:42.38
So I think it's like a combination, you know, you got like I said, Junior say, I'll

2179
02:28:43.50 --> 02:28:48.94
what better life could that guy have set up for himself? You know, he's got

2180
02:28:48.94 --> 02:28:55.18
everything that a person could want and yet he's in this cloud and it consumes him.

2181
02:28:55.90 --> 02:29:01.10
I mean, so to Chad, right? I mean, I exact great family, great life, he had respect, hit honor,

2182
02:29:02.06 --> 02:29:07.02
you know, everything, it doesn't get better than that, right? I mean, that's the

2183
02:29:07.02 --> 02:29:13.34
currency when you're in that line of line of work. You just want, you want to be respected and

2184
02:29:13.34 --> 02:29:20.30
you want them to think, oh, he's doing a good job and you know, you look at, you look at where

2185
02:29:20.30 --> 02:29:27.02
he went and what he did, he had that and when you can't see it, there's just something else going on.

2186
02:29:28.62 --> 02:29:34.14
Absolutely. And so when you kind of look at that, I mean, you know, it's like, what's the

2187
02:29:34.14 --> 02:29:38.70
responsibility moving forward, right? I mean, there's some command responsibility. I'm not

2188
02:29:38.70 --> 02:29:43.42
sitting here pointing fingers backwards. I'm sitting saying like, you know, part of what we want to do

2189
02:29:43.42 --> 02:29:49.02
is educate the next, the next crop and I know you're huge on this as well and I mean,

2190
02:29:50.14 --> 02:29:55.90
the hardest thing to do sometimes is it takes someone out of the game. So like, you know,

2191
02:29:55.90 --> 02:30:00.86
we started this in football, you've got the concussion, measurements and if you get a concussion,

2192
02:30:00.86 --> 02:30:04.86
you've got to come out and you know, if it's your star player, he's still got to come out.

2193
02:30:04.86 --> 02:30:11.34
And you start to look at like, how are we doing this in the military, you know? We kind of say

2194
02:30:11.34 --> 02:30:17.18
the military's not a social experiment because it's not. But the truth of the matter is is that

2195
02:30:17.18 --> 02:30:23.10
when you get into these, especially units like DevGrew and Delta and SF, right? I mean,

2196
02:30:23.10 --> 02:30:30.62
your job is to go win wars. I mean, this is not, that requires, I mean, the American Alpha male

2197
02:30:30.62 --> 02:30:38.14
is very special kind of thing in the history of history and it requires a special type of training,

2198
02:30:38.14 --> 02:30:47.10
it requires all sorts of things that make it very difficult to stop them from wanting to keep

2199
02:30:47.10 --> 02:30:51.82
going after that. You just, you, it's like we're breeding it into them. So like you take American

2200
02:30:51.82 --> 02:30:57.98
Alpha males and you make them more alpha. I mean, it's, it's quite impressive and you create these

2201
02:30:57.98 --> 02:31:04.46
units. I mean, they're story units. I mean, DevGrew, SEAL Team 6, I mean, the SEALs, these are, these are,

2202
02:31:05.66 --> 02:31:12.46
you know, it's very impressive. And so how do we, how do we protect the guys though?

2203
02:31:13.58 --> 02:31:17.74
And I say this from a two-way street, you know, it's one thing is here and say, oh, you know,

2204
02:31:18.14 --> 02:31:22.38
we got to know that if we're not sleeping well that there's something wrong and that's going to be a problem.

2205
02:31:22.38 --> 02:31:27.82
Like, okay, I'm like, I'm like, I'm on a team on my get. Got it, right? Take another pill. Right?

2206
02:31:27.82 --> 02:31:32.78
Work out a little harder. Maybe I'll sleep better. Yeah, good. You know? And it's like,

2207
02:31:32.78 --> 02:31:38.54
that's not going to work. Right? It's not going to work. It's at some point we have to, we have to

2208
02:31:38.54 --> 02:31:45.02
put more of a systematic approach in here to mental health. We've done that in SF, right? I mean,

2209
02:31:45.02 --> 02:31:49.58
they're starting to treat green berets like professional athletes, which is great. You know,

2210
02:31:49.58 --> 02:31:53.90
you've got a locker room, you've got, you know, the physical trainers, you get physicals, you get

2211
02:31:53.90 --> 02:32:00.38
checked up, you get all these things. And you know, if we don't, then it's too much of the loss is in vain.

2212
02:32:01.50 --> 02:32:06.70
Yeah, no, and they definitely are moving in that direction in the teams and the

2213
02:32:06.70 --> 02:32:12.06
seal teams, like the baseline studies that they're doing. They are absolutely moving that direction.

2214
02:32:12.06 --> 02:32:20.22
I mean, they have whole organizations within the organization that are focused on that. And yeah,

2215
02:32:20.22 --> 02:32:26.06
I mean, their lessons have definitely been learned. That's great. I mean, Chad killed himself

2216
02:32:26.06 --> 02:32:30.22
three years ago. Yeah. Like they were not moving. We're not moving fast enough. Here. I mean,

2217
02:32:30.22 --> 02:32:34.86
the VA, you know what the budget is for veterans who saw I prevention, it's 10.2 billion.

2218
02:32:34.86 --> 02:32:42.94
Wow. That's a big number. That is a big number. Right? And, you know, the VA gets just

2219
02:32:42.94 --> 02:32:48.54
shit on all over the place, right? The VA is actually trying. I mean, if you look at budget,

2220
02:32:48.54 --> 02:32:54.22
they're some trying, they're they're trying experimental stuff, anti-depressant nasal spray, right?

2221
02:32:55.10 --> 02:33:00.94
Virtual reality-based suicide prevention training. I mean, these kinds of things, they are,

2222
02:33:00.94 --> 02:33:10.46
there are things that we are trying. We as it a nation. And it's, at some point, you know,

2223
02:33:11.74 --> 02:33:19.58
the guys that are close to the guys and, and gals, I don't want to exclude the female service

2224
02:33:19.58 --> 02:33:24.06
members either because it affects them as well. I mean, you're actually statistically more likely

2225
02:33:24.06 --> 02:33:27.42
to commit suicide if you did not deploy than if you did.

2226
02:33:27.42 --> 02:33:37.18
Explain that again. So, if you did not, I mean, it's saying, you know, just because you were

2227
02:33:37.18 --> 02:33:44.94
on seal team six or just because you saw intense combat, right? That's not a predictor of suicide.

2228
02:33:44.94 --> 02:33:50.46
So, it might be a predictor of, you know, TBI and those kinds of things because, you know,

2229
02:33:50.46 --> 02:33:55.74
if all you do is explosive breach charges next to doors all day long, I mean, you know, commanders

2230
02:33:55.74 --> 02:34:01.18
have to figure out a way to limit that stuff. Like you can only do this so many times. I got it.

2231
02:34:01.18 --> 02:34:06.14
You don't want the first one to be on, you know, the, the house down range. You have to work with

2232
02:34:06.14 --> 02:34:11.66
live explosives. But, but at the same time, you can't, you can't just go through the same

2233
02:34:12.06 --> 02:34:18.46
repetitions a million times. And, you know what I mean? The other part is you have your, your team

2234
02:34:18.46 --> 02:34:25.66
time and you roll off a team and there's always guys behind you. And, and this is credit to America

2235
02:34:25.66 --> 02:34:31.50
first off and credit to just who we are, we sign up when we say send me. And, and there's a lot of

2236
02:34:31.50 --> 02:34:37.50
us that that answer that when you're on that, when you're living that life and you're on these

2237
02:34:37.50 --> 02:34:43.02
deployments doing this cool stuff, you don't want to miss any of it. You're like, this is my slot.

2238
02:34:43.02 --> 02:34:47.98
Nobody's coming in behind me and, you know, Sarah, you told me this. You're like, you know,

2239
02:34:47.98 --> 02:34:52.38
in the truth of the matter, there's, there's a lot more seals right behind you. And so,

2240
02:34:52.38 --> 02:34:57.18
commanders have this at their, at their discretion. They have this, this ability to kind of

2241
02:34:57.18 --> 02:35:02.54
how do we, we can take a look back now, right? Remove all the politics about, you know, the

2242
02:35:02.54 --> 02:35:07.10
wars are ending. Well, the wars aren't going to end for the tier one units ever, right? But, at

2243
02:35:07.10 --> 02:35:14.62
the same time, we have an operational, we're not cool. There's less going on. There's less work.

2244
02:35:14.62 --> 02:35:19.58
And we have this ability to kind of reset a little bit the way that we're, the way that we're approaching

2245
02:35:19.58 --> 02:35:26.38
this. Yeah. Yeah. Well, this kind of conversation right here is a thing that can hopefully

2246
02:35:26.38 --> 02:35:32.06
move this in the right direction. And I know that's the main reason that you're sitting here today

2247
02:35:32.06 --> 02:35:39.58
is to try and move this in the right direction. And, and you're actually, when let's talk about

2248
02:35:39.58 --> 02:35:44.86
how you're doing that, let's talk about, you know, the actual charities and stuff that you guys

2249
02:35:44.86 --> 02:35:50.46
are doing to try and ways or what raise awareness. Yeah. So, the one thing Jason and I are

2250
02:35:50.46 --> 02:35:57.26
partnered on is the workout and honor of my husband. We refer to it as Chad 1,000 X. Again,

2251
02:35:57.26 --> 02:36:03.42
I spoke about this at his funeral. As he prepped it, he climbed that mountain. He did it by doing

2252
02:36:03.42 --> 02:36:10.86
step-ups on a box and he did it on a 20-inch box with a 45-pound pack working up to a thousand

2253
02:36:10.86 --> 02:36:15.26
over a period of time. And then once he got there, then he would just like pump out a thousand every

2254
02:36:15.26 --> 02:36:23.42
couple days. Chad was super disciplined. He was incredibly focused and every goal that he had. And

2255
02:36:23.42 --> 02:36:31.98
that's definitely something that I'm trying to have live within me. This workout I talked about

2256
02:36:31.98 --> 02:36:38.70
it as funeral and so more or less organically kind of just became a thing. Right? Dave was there.

2257
02:36:38.70 --> 02:36:43.50
CrossFit friends were there. Dave Castro was there. Yeah. And they just did it on their own

2258
02:36:44.22 --> 02:36:49.10
just because they thought, oh, challenge, right? That's cool. A thousand step-ups, 45, you know, man stuff.

2259
02:36:49.10 --> 02:36:56.94
Let's do it. And then fast forward. I'll stop you there. I won't speak for Dave, but I will say,

2260
02:36:58.22 --> 02:37:04.14
Dave knew Chad. They served, they served together. And he doesn't know how to process that.

2261
02:37:04.14 --> 02:37:07.34
You know? I mean, he doesn't know how to process the loss of a friend,

2262
02:37:07.34 --> 02:37:13.90
especially to suicide. And so, you know, he's trying to do, it is amazing how many people want to

2263
02:37:13.90 --> 02:37:21.26
help. How many people this is affected? I mean, Chad's life ripple effects huge, but everybody has this,

2264
02:37:22.46 --> 02:37:28.54
there's some, this, this epidemic has touched so many people and nobody knows how to deal with it.

2265
02:37:29.26 --> 02:37:34.94
Nobody knows how. I mean, my supposed to do 22 pushups and from my, you know, phone and and publish it on

2266
02:37:34.94 --> 02:37:41.98
social media. I mean, is that helping? 22 is not the number. Right. That's not even an accurate number.

2267
02:37:41.98 --> 02:37:48.94
It's 17 now, which is, which is better. You know, it's just so many people want to want to help.

2268
02:37:48.94 --> 02:37:56.38
So I think, you know, Dave, for his part, I mean, I know he, he wanted to honor Chad and, you know,

2269
02:37:56.38 --> 02:38:05.42
I think he wanted other people to honor Chad as well. And that's, yeah. So, so we established Chad

2270
02:38:05.42 --> 02:38:14.46
1,000 X into an annual fundraiser. And there, there are many spouses like myself, Goldstar

2271
02:38:14.46 --> 02:38:18.06
spouses, and they've gone on and there's golf tournaments and there's five keys and there's the

2272
02:38:18.06 --> 02:38:24.54
like and they raise money for different organizations. This workout specifically, we want

2273
02:38:24.54 --> 02:38:33.10
around veterans day because while it's Chad's face and I have kind of stepped into the role of

2274
02:38:33.10 --> 02:38:41.82
sharing his story for me, it has less to do with with Chad Wilkinson and more to do about the

2275
02:38:41.82 --> 02:38:48.94
struggle that our veterans currently have. And so why not really focus this around veterans day

2276
02:38:48.94 --> 02:38:53.98
when that's what we're doing, honoring those serving and create a platform for them to talk to

2277
02:38:53.98 --> 02:39:00.54
one another. We did this last year and it was kind of a late rollout and we're like, let's just

2278
02:39:00.54 --> 02:39:07.74
like do this and see what happens and very we really had no expectation and I can't even express how

2279
02:39:08.14 --> 02:39:15.98
humbled we were by the response and I mean it, it went global and went around the world. People

2280
02:39:15.98 --> 02:39:25.02
people did this workout. I think the beauty of it is anybody can do this workout because a step

2281
02:39:25.02 --> 02:39:31.90
up is not technical, we're not snatching, there's no muscle ups that you know anybody can do a step

2282
02:39:31.90 --> 02:39:38.38
up and then obviously we scale it and you know you have this huge fitness background, you're

2283
02:39:38.38 --> 02:39:44.46
well aware not everyone has to do the 20 inch box not everybody has to do that weight but being able

2284
02:39:44.46 --> 02:39:54.14
to go do a workout and honor of someone in our military that that generally brings people together

2285
02:39:54.14 --> 02:40:01.50
anyway because they want to kind of pay their humble respects but the potential that it could bring

2286
02:40:02.06 --> 02:40:08.14
for people to have a conversation whether it's you're doing the step ups and maybe you start to

2287
02:40:08.14 --> 02:40:13.50
realize in that hour time frame where your brain does go what do you think about you know

2288
02:40:14.30 --> 02:40:20.46
your struggle the person you're doing it for the friend you lost do you do it with a friend

2289
02:40:20.46 --> 02:40:25.26
and you guys can talk to each other well I think Jason and I have confirmed that once you get

2290
02:40:25.26 --> 02:40:32.94
to probably about 500 you don't really talk anymore but the idea of doing it with a friend

2291
02:40:32.94 --> 02:40:40.22
the symbolism there is to me everybody needs somebody. Have you put together technical

2292
02:40:40.22 --> 02:40:47.66
question here have you put together like a ramp up program for people to do you know two months out

2293
02:40:47.66 --> 02:40:53.90
do a hundred and then whatever break it down like you know those marathon programming things

2294
02:40:53.90 --> 02:41:00.78
where yeah there's working the program yeah yeah and so you know part of the the bigger

2295
02:41:00.78 --> 02:41:08.70
message here is you know I've never met the guy that I served with ever who said man I'm really looking

2296
02:41:08.70 --> 02:41:12.54
forward to going to that shrinks office with the waterfall in the background and it's really quiet

2297
02:41:12.54 --> 02:41:17.82
and let's go talk about feelings but I've never met that I've never met that person right especially

2298
02:41:17.82 --> 02:41:25.10
from our community well have you heard a night go Chad went okay do you want to know how I feel about

2299
02:41:25.10 --> 02:41:31.82
it sure I mean I've I've talked to a lot of guys I went to it that thought it was awesome

2300
02:41:32.62 --> 02:41:38.70
and I don't know when Chad went December 2016 and we went to years he was dead if I found seven

2301
02:41:38.70 --> 02:41:44.94
TBIs on his brain and they laughed what do you mean that wasn't very many one of the guys we were

2302
02:41:44.94 --> 02:41:49.02
with have 42 he made a joke he said yeah I got to walk around with Vupal helmet because I can't

2303
02:41:49.02 --> 02:41:53.58
risk falling over the guy you know I mean they can joke among each other but it's just like

2304
02:41:53.58 --> 02:41:59.18
seven TBIs so that wasn't very many but you know what you can't find on all those screens

2305
02:41:59.18 --> 02:42:10.22
CTE or interface astroglovescarring so you know I am of I am an advocate of whatever you find

2306
02:42:10.22 --> 02:42:24.14
works if that works for you do it 100% I believe it feel it live it but I am not convinced by any

2307
02:42:24.14 --> 02:42:34.46
military centered organization that they're really doing any sort of good yet and I don't know if

2308
02:42:34.46 --> 02:42:42.14
they just want to talk about it and not be about it but less than two years later Chad was dead

2309
02:42:42.14 --> 02:42:46.70
and you know you do all the things I mean there there is a lot of assessment that happens at that

2310
02:42:46.70 --> 02:42:55.66
place and could be potentially good it told me almost all the things I already knew about him as a spouse

2311
02:42:57.18 --> 02:43:04.46
I are you know they did personality tests and different stress tests and I mean yes I don't know

2312
02:43:04.46 --> 02:43:12.06
the scientific sleep lab study but I could tell you his sleep is shit they did a test where they are

2313
02:43:12.06 --> 02:43:17.50
trying to realize are you the guy that's gonna I'm trying to figure the best way they said this

2314
02:43:17.50 --> 02:43:22.30
basically are you the guy that's gonna see a problem and respond right away like rapid fire like

2315
02:43:22.30 --> 02:43:27.34
bull in a china shop are you the guy that's gonna like take a minute assess it and you're not going

2316
02:43:27.34 --> 02:43:31.90
to be very fast but it's gonna be methodical and it's gonna be perfect well that's Chad if you would have

2317
02:43:31.90 --> 02:43:38.70
ever watched him pack a car for a family trip that's Chad so all the things that they did there you know

2318
02:43:38.70 --> 02:43:46.22
I don't feel like it gave me any more insight than I already had and I'm not so sure that's the

2319
02:43:46.22 --> 02:43:52.54
case for Chad I mean and they do art therapy and they do dog therapy and they do music therapy

2320
02:43:53.34 --> 02:43:59.42
and I mean even them making him walk a dog he finally said to him hey man I'll do whatever you want

2321
02:43:59.42 --> 02:44:03.98
me to do but I'm not walking this damn dog he's probably one of the few team guys that like he

2322
02:44:03.98 --> 02:44:11.26
didn't like dogs so yeah if it works for people and they got something out of it great but the

2323
02:44:11.26 --> 02:44:15.50
way I see it is it's a way for the guys to go fat in their medical records so they can punch the

2324
02:44:15.50 --> 02:44:21.10
ticket on where their medical disability lies which to be totally frank as a spouse every single

2325
02:44:21.10 --> 02:44:28.14
one of those dudes should be a hundred percent disabled yeah no I I never went to it it wasn't I don't

2326
02:44:28.14 --> 02:44:33.82
think it was it was in existence maybe but I never went to it but I do know a lot of guys that went

2327
02:44:33.82 --> 02:44:37.90
to it that got a lot out of it and part of what they got out of it yeah they're looking at

2328
02:44:37.90 --> 02:44:42.86
their medical record but you know they're I mean just the the decompression aspect of it

2329
02:44:42.86 --> 02:44:49.66
meaning for 30 days like you're just gonna eat nice food and like not do anything not

2330
02:44:49.66 --> 02:44:54.94
blown anything up or whatever there was and and guys felt I definitely know some guys that got

2331
02:44:54.94 --> 02:45:02.22
a lot out of going to it clearly there's some shortfalls especially if they find issues and

2332
02:45:02.22 --> 02:45:06.14
they're like oh yeah this is no factor that seems kind of crazy but yeah you mentioned that

2333
02:45:06.14 --> 02:45:12.70
CTE thing because they can't they can't CTE follow your alive right it's post mortum so

2334
02:45:12.70 --> 02:45:19.58
same thing interface out of school of scarring right now there is no test for it so to some degree

2335
02:45:19.58 --> 02:45:24.70
those guys out there that has served multiple deployments and know you have some TBI's

2336
02:45:24.70 --> 02:45:33.26
you might want to almost assume that that could be in there what what I think could be a great

2337
02:45:33.26 --> 02:45:38.62
way and an extension of service for some of our military as this cakeo form we fill out

2338
02:45:38.62 --> 02:45:48.14
before the guys deploy and for listeners it's it's it's it's it's it's a form we fill out

2339
02:45:48.14 --> 02:45:53.10
that basically says what's gonna happen should your husband get killed or or wife your spouse

2340
02:45:53.10 --> 02:45:57.66
gets killed and everything from who's gonna show a pet your door are they gonna weather

2341
02:45:57.66 --> 02:46:02.22
uniform is it military honors are they buried are they cremated who's gonna take your kids all

2342
02:46:02.22 --> 02:46:09.02
all those you know pretty important questions it's kind of sad that when you fill it out so many

2343
02:46:09.02 --> 02:46:14.14
times it's commonplace I remember the first time I filled it out we mold over these questions

2344
02:46:14.14 --> 02:46:19.42
for so long and and by the end of the deployments I mean I'm like making dinner and I'm like oh yeah

2345
02:46:19.42 --> 02:46:23.50
that's fine yep that's fine wait change that because she moved and she's not gonna be able to get

2346
02:46:23.50 --> 02:46:30.46
here in time so make it this person I mean that's how it is but and there's there is some there is

2347
02:46:31.02 --> 02:46:35.58
gonna be some limitations and I don't know what they are but we were able to donate Chad's brain

2348
02:46:35.58 --> 02:46:42.62
because he he was state side and you have to do it probably within 48 to 72 hours I'm not quite

2349
02:46:42.62 --> 02:46:47.58
sure with the time frame is and his brain was studied and that's how we were able to determine

2350
02:46:47.58 --> 02:46:53.26
that he did have that and I don't know if it would be applicable if you're overseas because of

2351
02:46:53.26 --> 02:46:59.58
travel time etc but if you were to add that on the cakeo form that if you were killed you would

2352
02:46:59.58 --> 02:47:08.70
like your brain donated this is in no way to encourage anybody to take their life by any means

2353
02:47:08.70 --> 02:47:15.42
but either way if you're a team guy and and you get in a car accident and you die fill in the

2354
02:47:15.42 --> 02:47:21.74
blank if you could also put on there or at least have a conversation with your person that you

2355
02:47:21.74 --> 02:47:31.58
also want your brain donated that would be a great extension of service I think that's a straightforward

2356
02:47:31.58 --> 02:47:37.50
ask I mean yeah the straightforward ask brain study is kind of a big it's a big topic in

2357
02:47:37.50 --> 02:47:42.94
those circles right now there there's so many elements that go into this but you know there's

2358
02:47:42.94 --> 02:47:49.82
the two places where the brain's really being studied right now are China and Japan and Europe

2359
02:47:49.82 --> 02:47:54.54
you know they're just protests on chimpanzees excuse me and so you know because they're the closest

2360
02:47:54.54 --> 02:48:01.26
to the the best way to study the brain is while it's working you know you can't make sense right

2361
02:48:01.26 --> 02:48:08.94
and so you know we have issues doing that here with chimpanzees you know they're they're

2362
02:48:08.94 --> 02:48:15.74
chasing off the European equivalent of pedas chasing off you know scientists from Europe they're

2363
02:48:15.74 --> 02:48:20.78
they're just setting up shop in China and so like yeah we're gonna we're gonna graph this brain you know

2364
02:48:20.78 --> 02:48:28.22
and so there's a lot of there's a lot of challenges that we will we will face what what we do

2365
02:48:28.22 --> 02:48:35.10
know is that mass veteran suicide is not a thing guys don't all get together and kill themselves at

2366
02:48:35.10 --> 02:48:42.30
the same time what we need we need to create communities with with bonds of people that were

2367
02:48:42.30 --> 02:48:49.74
able to take some of the lessons that that Sarah's bravely sharing with us and and so many behind

2368
02:48:49.74 --> 02:48:54.46
or behind and around her are sharing about their journey what they've seen we need to strengthen

2369
02:48:54.46 --> 02:48:59.18
the community so that we're able to kind of watch after each other because the military has a

2370
02:48:59.18 --> 02:49:08.06
stronger social fabric than pretty much anywhere and in sort of normal you know middle America or

2371
02:49:08.06 --> 02:49:13.66
anywhere America right and still you're your 1.5 there's a lot of different statistics but you're

2372
02:49:13.66 --> 02:49:20.30
1.5 times more likely to take your life if you're in the military than if you're not and it's just you

2373
02:49:20.30 --> 02:49:26.86
know how is this happening like how is this okay well it's not okay and so what we're trying to

2374
02:49:26.86 --> 02:49:31.58
do and what we are doing is bringing people together in the real world not in a shrinks office

2375
02:49:31.58 --> 02:49:36.22
with the waterfall you know that you don't want to be there and it's like hey you know physical health

2376
02:49:36.78 --> 02:49:41.18
mental health somehow those are definitely we don't have to study chimpanzees to know that those

2377
02:49:41.18 --> 02:49:48.54
are definitely tied together and obviously Chad did not suffer from physical you know like he could

2378
02:49:48.54 --> 02:49:52.78
do a thousand step ups just fine and climb mountains and stuff but you know all these things you know

2379
02:49:52.78 --> 02:49:59.02
you're not sleeping well great work out you know you talk about this all the time jocco right you know

2380
02:49:59.74 --> 02:50:04.86
and and so bring people together yes think about this and so it was really telling when we did

2381
02:50:04.86 --> 02:50:09.98
this in Virginia Beach and and guys it chatted served with showed up you know quietly kind of

2382
02:50:09.98 --> 02:50:17.18
did the work you know they showed up in the big f9 50s you know it's like just awesome this is

2383
02:50:17.18 --> 02:50:24.22
America god bless us right and you know they showed up and if this was a group counseling session

2384
02:50:24.22 --> 02:50:29.58
to talk about you know the mandatory briefs away nobody's showing up for that stuff but you show

2385
02:50:29.58 --> 02:50:35.10
up and you do the work in honor of you know to honor Chad's life and to think about veteran

2386
02:50:35.10 --> 02:50:40.62
suicide prevention to think about this unbreakable guy right I mean go ask anybody in the navy

2387
02:50:40.62 --> 02:50:47.74
that go on to be a seal do you want Chad's career they're like yes that's I want that to be me and

2388
02:50:47.74 --> 02:50:53.58
you got guys showing up and you know there there's some community around it you know everyone's

2389
02:50:53.58 --> 02:51:00.70
then bend in seris ear that's you know because it's issue is so close to so close to so many people

2390
02:51:00.70 --> 02:51:06.46
in the community and but you're just strengthening bonds right you bring people together in the

2391
02:51:06.46 --> 02:51:10.78
real world this is very counter culture and we're very cool with that you know and a world where

2392
02:51:10.78 --> 02:51:15.10
kids are grown up text messaging each other to instead of talking instead of sitting in the

2393
02:51:15.10 --> 02:51:22.78
captain's gap like like we are right now right and we need this where social animals and we need to

2394
02:51:22.78 --> 02:51:29.34
be a part of something bigger than ourselves and so that's that's what we're about and physical health

2395
02:51:29.34 --> 02:51:36.30
and mental health and raising awareness and it's it can't just be you know trying to beat it into

2396
02:51:36.30 --> 02:51:40.78
people right like oh I'm a hammer I see a nail let me just tell let me tell you about veteran

2397
02:51:40.78 --> 02:51:47.10
suicide prevention people just tune that out but when you've got a story as got a story like

2398
02:51:47.10 --> 02:51:52.54
chas and you got some like Sarah that's that's able and willing to tell it I mean this is hard

2399
02:51:52.54 --> 02:51:57.50
she's got to she's got to saddle up every time every time for this and she's doing it because she

2400
02:51:57.50 --> 02:52:02.70
wants to change the number and she wants other people to not go through what she's had to go through

2401
02:52:03.26 --> 02:52:10.54
and there's there's a lot of bravery that goes into that and you know and so that's I'm I'm proud

2402
02:52:10.54 --> 02:52:16.86
that we get to I mean I work for her in this go rock works for her and you know we don't do anything

2403
02:52:16.86 --> 02:52:22.78
that that she's not on board with in terms of Chad's story or just the way that we're running the

2404
02:52:22.78 --> 02:52:29.82
event around and you know we just have this is just a unique opportunity in the kind of veteran

2405
02:52:29.82 --> 02:52:36.06
suicide prevention space that that nobody wants to be too close to but unfortunately you know some

2406
02:52:36.06 --> 02:52:42.06
of us are and and so it's a real honor this is this is the thing I'm most proud of that have been

2407
02:52:42.06 --> 02:52:51.42
a part of because it is it's it's it's it's changing lives helping people and bringing them together

2408
02:52:51.42 --> 02:52:56.38
and raising awareness for something that is is really important to me because I know I know you've

2409
02:52:56.38 --> 02:53:01.74
lost people in your circle I'm sure people in my circle there's you know you have to

2410
02:53:01.74 --> 02:53:08.14
Sarah sit right there I mean this is this is her life and so it just this is this matters this

2411
02:53:08.14 --> 02:53:15.74
matters hugely to us well I'm on board like what do people need to do when they're on board what

2412
02:53:15.74 --> 02:53:23.26
are we doing what's what's our deal well we we want people to take to the workout and that

2413
02:53:23.26 --> 02:53:28.94
might look different for a lot of people you can go to your local gyms jump on it do it in your

2414
02:53:28.94 --> 02:53:34.62
garage find a buddy we're hosting larger scale what we call live events this year and we're doing

02:54:23.42 --> 02:54:29.02
jacks jacks is actually November 6th now oh is it we've moved a little bit earlier yes we're hosting so

2424
02:54:29.02 --> 02:54:34.78
you know call it a big giant monster start start getting your your train on you got a thousand

2425
02:54:34.78 --> 02:54:43.50
box steps with a forty five pound rock bro that's a get some evolution that's a get some evolution for

2426
02:54:43.50 --> 02:54:48.22
sure you know he used to do that I don't know if you know this but he used to do it in the garage

2427
02:54:48.22 --> 02:54:53.74
I've video of this him doing step ups and he would do it and you know the garage and just shorts

2428
02:54:53.74 --> 02:54:59.34
and his backpack he cut all the tags out of his gear right ounces equal pound Sarah ounces equal

2429
02:54:59.34 --> 02:55:04.70
pound so he knew he was carrying but he used a projector and he projected a concoge on the back

2430
02:55:04.70 --> 02:55:12.14
of our garage door so when I talk about focus that's how focused he was and that's that's how

2431
02:55:12.14 --> 02:55:17.66
focused I am with this so and then and then what what we're raising money is that what we're doing

2432
02:55:17.66 --> 02:55:22.62
we are raising money okay so um this this came about through a partnership that go rock at

2433
02:55:22.62 --> 02:55:27.58
had with the Navy seal foundation also you know one of your brothers Chris Irwin who was Sarah was

2434
02:55:27.58 --> 02:55:32.62
his level one cross fit instructor in Virginia Beach way back when I mean you know everyone is so

2435
02:55:32.62 --> 02:55:39.42
close to to everyone and he had he had called me and said hey you know because did you

2436
02:55:39.42 --> 02:55:44.94
look teach you any of these ones out here on the west coast I taught some in Delmar

2437
02:55:44.94 --> 02:55:50.38
yeah I think I probably went to two or three of those over the years in that time frame too yeah

2438
02:55:50.38 --> 02:55:55.34
yeah yeah I'm really surprised yeah I was like I was the massive deadlift now

2439
02:55:55.34 --> 02:55:58.14
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

2440
02:55:58.14 --> 02:56:03.58
no you would not remember me from my physical attributes at a cross fits ever not yeah so we're

2441
02:56:03.58 --> 02:56:09.02
raising money so we're raising money and you know this this came about through that partnership and

2442
02:56:09.02 --> 02:56:14.70
and you know Chris had called me up and he was like you know nobody knows how to deal with this

2443
02:56:14.70 --> 02:56:22.06
man everyone wants to deal with it and nobody knows how to deal with it and you know so you get

2444
02:56:22.06 --> 02:56:26.70
guys that are in positions that you're at the seal foundation and go rock whatever right it's like

2445
02:56:26.70 --> 02:56:30.70
we we want to deal with this we still didn't know how to deal with it and it's like well I think I got

2446
02:56:31.34 --> 02:56:37.18
I think this Chad workout is the way that we can deal with this he goes but I got to call Sarah

2447
02:56:37.18 --> 02:56:41.90
because obviously you know you don't do anything without the family and the family's not on board

2448
02:56:41.90 --> 02:56:47.58
especially the this spouse I mean spouse is the that that's the that's the that's the deal and you know

2449
02:56:47.58 --> 02:56:52.94
she had to think about it you know said no and then thought about it we ended up chatting with me and

2450
02:56:52.94 --> 02:56:59.02
Emily and and Chris and Sarah and a call amount you know it's Florida we have you know it's hot

2451
02:56:59.02 --> 02:57:03.50
about side my kids are inside pure chaos we're chatting on zoom or whatever it was in the middle

2452
02:57:03.50 --> 02:57:08.86
of the pandemic and she's finally like okay let's do this and I'm like I kind of said okay well you

2453
02:57:08.86 --> 02:57:13.98
know if you change your mind she's like no I've made up my mind we're doing this right and so to

2454
02:57:13.98 --> 02:57:19.90
to throw her another like cross if there's a lot of hard workouts in CrossFit right a lot of you can

2455
02:57:19.90 --> 02:57:26.46
look at you know you can do them harder you can scale them to whatever the the hardest the hardest

2456
02:57:26.46 --> 02:57:32.78
workout in the history of CrossFit that's ever been done was how she did Chad the first time

2457
02:57:33.42 --> 02:57:38.94
she went into into their garage and she put on Chad's Rucksack by herself and did Chad

2458
02:57:38.94 --> 02:57:44.94
so think about that when you're feeling sorry for yourself out there you know because it's a hard

2459
02:57:44.94 --> 02:57:50.14
workout and it is right and and that's what it's supposed to be everyone's selling easy that that's

2460
02:57:50.14 --> 02:57:55.74
you don't think about anything when when life's easy except the next easy thing you're going to get right

2461
02:57:55.74 --> 02:58:01.58
you're you're meant to dig deep you're meant to think about this and and that's that's the goal and so

2462
02:58:01.58 --> 02:58:09.18
raising money half of it's going to the seal foundation Sarah has a nonprofit called the step up project and

2463
02:58:09.18 --> 02:58:14.22
and that's you know it's it's veteran mental health stuff it's all going to support that

2464
02:58:15.66 --> 02:58:22.30
yeah well that's outstanding and you know I have to throw this out there because like earlier you

2465
02:58:22.30 --> 02:58:27.10
we were talking in the middle of whatever some high emotion moments and you said something about the

2466
02:58:27.10 --> 02:58:34.46
the the families right and I just I I thought about it but then you know we kept talking but

2467
02:58:34.46 --> 02:58:40.78
just the fact that the military families out there and what they put up with and what they go through

2468
02:58:40.78 --> 02:58:46.46
and usually I mean in my mind I have to worry more than the people that are than the military themselves

2469
02:58:47.50 --> 02:58:53.66
so on on top of all this just you know the families that are out there that the the

2470
02:58:53.66 --> 02:59:03.02
the spouses you know come on down too because like it just get to know other people that are

2471
02:59:03.02 --> 02:59:09.10
living that life you know I know that might might my wife you know she wasn't around we didn't have

2472
02:59:09.10 --> 02:59:13.66
any family around like we didn't have any family we lived in California we lived in Virginia Beach I was

2473
02:59:13.66 --> 02:59:18.06
gone almost the entire time she didn't know anyone she ended up doing what you did which is going to

2474
02:59:18.06 --> 02:59:24.78
live with my parents for a while but yeah just families right military families too come and get it

2475
02:59:24.78 --> 02:59:30.30
that's what I'm thinking family friendly kid friendly we don't discriminate come on down all of them

2476
02:59:30.30 --> 02:59:34.86
it was it was so awesome in Virginia Beach it was such a great vibe you know we were there at the

2477
02:59:35.58 --> 02:59:41.98
crack a dawn right set and box is up and then you know it's like all of a sudden people start

2478
02:59:41.98 --> 02:59:46.38
to show up in waves because you need a box right so there's waves of people getting on the box

2479
02:59:46.38 --> 02:59:52.30
and people I mean we were there my flight was late that that afternoon and you guys are still you know

2480
02:59:52.30 --> 02:59:57.74
there was still a big crew there just like social it was social and so it's not a depressing

2481
02:59:58.86 --> 03:00:03.42
you know it's not it's not like you just people can't live inside that space forever right

2482
03:00:03.42 --> 03:00:07.58
you have you you have your your difficult moments and you think about it and it's in it's hard

2483
03:00:08.22 --> 03:00:15.18
but you know anybody anybody that that served the way that Chad served like the guys I served with

2484
03:00:15.18 --> 03:00:21.34
you don't want people to walk around depressed after you're gone you want them you you don't want that

2485
03:00:22.14 --> 03:00:29.66
I also think like a lot of I just think the more we do talk about it the the easier it is for someone

2486
03:00:29.66 --> 03:00:38.78
else to say me too and so it's hard to come out and talk about this all the time and I've had

2487
03:00:38.78 --> 03:00:45.82
this week has been a very busy week for me so I'm pretty it's been hard but I have to believe that

2488
03:00:45.82 --> 03:00:52.70
the more I talk about it and share Chad's story or share the story of of other friends that have

2489
03:00:52.70 --> 03:00:58.14
passed took their lives that other people will start to speak up at this virginian beach event I had

2490
03:00:58.14 --> 03:01:05.02
three people separately pull me aside and confide in me struggles that they had I've had people

2491
03:01:05.02 --> 03:01:10.38
reach out to me through social media like long messages I don't care I don't care how long it is I don't

2492
03:01:10.38 --> 03:01:18.46
care how short it is and I respond back and I I think that it's slow and I think it's a trickle

2493
03:01:18.46 --> 03:01:26.70
but the potential for this workout done around veterans day so we can talk about people's stories

2494
03:01:26.70 --> 03:01:32.94
so that it might encourage someone else to say me too maybe all if all they need to hear is that

2495
03:01:32.94 --> 03:01:37.10
they're not alone and that someone else feels that too maybe that's what someone needs and that's great

2496
03:01:37.10 --> 03:01:47.18
yeah that's uh when you know what's happening it makes me so much easier and I talk about this

2497
03:01:47.18 --> 03:01:51.34
like you get a new guy like Jason you get a new guy that looks really nervous before their first

2498
03:01:51.34 --> 03:01:56.14
operation and if you go hey bro here's what's going on your nervous it's cool you're a little

2499
03:01:56.14 --> 03:02:00.62
crazy your stomach's a little messed up yeah because they're they're scared they're nervous and if

2500
03:02:00.62 --> 03:02:04.70
you go yeah that's normal it's just no big deal you're gonna feel that that way a little bit before

2501
03:02:04.70 --> 03:02:08.54
you go on an ops uh no big deal don't worry about it that's your body preparing to go into combat it's

2502
03:02:08.54 --> 03:02:13.50
all good and you can see like relief on their face that's mentorship right there yeah yeah we need more

2503
03:02:13.50 --> 03:02:21.66
of that yeah and this to me this this whole thing is like if you can tell someone oh yeah you you've

2504
03:02:21.66 --> 03:02:27.74
breached 47 doors in your last three week trip which is not an extraordinary and I'm like that

2505
03:02:27.74 --> 03:02:33.74
that's you know oh you you've got crashed in the room however many times you shot a coral goost off

2506
03:02:34.54 --> 03:02:41.42
29 times you or you were the rate the RSO so you had you know two troops go through and shoot

2507
03:02:41.42 --> 03:02:49.50
one per man and you rate you RSO all the fun that's whatever you know 80 freaking blast next to your

2508
03:02:49.50 --> 03:02:54.62
head that you sat through and there's some things that are going on inside your brain here's what's

2509
03:02:54.62 --> 03:03:00.30
going on here's what you need to watch out for here's how you can get ahead of it that kind of

2510
03:03:00.30 --> 03:03:06.22
conversation about this stuff is the same thing that it impacts that young new guy that goes okay

2511
03:03:06.22 --> 03:03:12.54
got it now I can grab it now I can get a hold of it and I can move forward it's awesome

2512
03:03:15.58 --> 03:03:23.66
Chad 1000x dot com that's where we can go to find out about this stuff go rock your at go rock

2513
03:03:23.66 --> 03:03:28.86
cross the board cross the board Jason if you want to talk to Jason at go rock and just go rock

2514
03:03:28.86 --> 03:03:37.74
if I live in Idaho can I do go go rock yes what if I live in Nebraska so look here's the thing

2515
03:03:37.74 --> 03:03:43.98
we have we have 500 official go rock clubs around the the country and and part of it is

2516
03:03:44.70 --> 03:03:50.30
we we're activating all of them for this we really believe in this world of people getting together

2517
03:03:50.30 --> 03:03:55.34
in the real world and this is not about you don't have to be of a veteran to do this you don't

2518
03:03:55.34 --> 03:04:00.14
have to be anything except willing to show up right and you get so much out of that and got through

2519
03:04:00.14 --> 03:04:06.62
a freaking thousand stuff up it just that fly out yeah it's an hour you know it's an hour yeah

2520
03:04:06.62 --> 03:04:12.94
okay slow and steady slow and steady wins the race yeah I mean yeah and you want to train up

2521
03:04:13.42 --> 03:04:18.62
yeah well that's maybe we need to release some kind of a preparatory workout so I want to

2522
03:04:18.62 --> 03:04:25.34
wrap though people coming up you're worried about people coming at you after for for a

2523
03:04:25.34 --> 03:04:31.34
wrappedo now come on I've imposed a wrappedo on a few people and it it doesn't feel good I feel

2524
03:04:31.34 --> 03:04:37.82
comfortable you know I always feel like I don't do it anymore I kind of figured it out like it's just

2525
03:04:38.62 --> 03:04:44.22
it's not I don't like doing that to people no no we it's same thing so this claimer is you need to

2526
03:04:44.22 --> 03:04:49.90
train yourself up this is an hour it's it's step ups yeah you got it up up so the 45 found

2527
03:04:49.90 --> 03:04:53.98
played on your back yeah scale it down if you're not right do we need to train what we need to

2528
03:04:53.98 --> 03:04:59.02
train for yes that's what I'm saying so it's a buy-in for your your workout it's it's a cash out

2529
03:04:59.02 --> 03:05:03.50
for your workouts whatever else you're doing just just integrate a box if you've got a cooler

2530
03:05:03.50 --> 03:05:08.38
in your house use a cooler if there's you know like whatever the case may be you have steps

2531
03:05:08.38 --> 03:05:18.30
yep get it uh Instagram you're on Instagram yes Sarah Wilkinson 7 number 7 yep

2532
03:05:20.70 --> 03:05:27.26
Jason you got anything else did I miss anything I don't think so and do we miss anything

2533
03:05:28.54 --> 03:05:34.70
oh well I guess just to bring just to make the point one more time and is that where we find the

2534
03:05:34.70 --> 03:05:42.78
guys are very fragile I'm gonna say fragile is in their transition time so when people are

2535
03:05:42.78 --> 03:05:47.66
separating from the military maybe they didn't hit retirement maybe they've done 10 years in

2536
03:05:47.66 --> 03:05:54.62
their transitioning out or their at retirement and now they need to transition to civilian life that

2537
03:05:54.62 --> 03:06:04.14
is a very for a seal I'm gonna say that's a very delicate time for them and I would encourage

2538
03:06:04.14 --> 03:06:12.22
families peers to really be on the lookout for them during that time because as we've talked so

2539
03:06:12.22 --> 03:06:20.38
much about the brain and PTSD there's also that loss of of tribe or at least they feel as though

2540
03:06:20.38 --> 03:06:28.62
there is and what we see is sometimes that increases the likelihood of maybe someone not making a

2541
03:06:28.62 --> 03:06:36.06
really good decision so I would just encourage people to just be of the best support for those people

2542
03:06:36.06 --> 03:06:43.34
during that period of transition yeah interestingly that's when a that's when a seal platoon is

2543
03:06:43.34 --> 03:06:50.06
most exposed when they're transitioning from the water to the land or the land to the water and there's

2544
03:06:50.06 --> 03:06:55.90
not only a perceived loss of tribe like you're talking about but also that perceived loss of

2545
03:06:55.90 --> 03:07:00.22
mission because what have I been doing my whole life and all of a sudden what am I gonna do now?

2546
03:07:01.42 --> 03:07:06.94
Yeah when Chad when Chad was close to 20 years we were at the discussion of what we do you know my

2547
03:07:06.94 --> 03:07:15.02
dad served 26 years his dad served somewhere about that I can't quite remember and you know the hard part

2548
03:07:15.02 --> 03:07:22.30
is I I really kind of hope he would pick us I thought okay we've done 20 years like we've done 20

2549
03:07:22.30 --> 03:07:33.10
years me Sarah Chad Kinsey Hudson we've done it boom pick us and he didn't and I again believe he

2550
03:07:33.10 --> 03:07:44.06
had a warrior's heart and he was born to do this but I said to him well you know we talked about

2551
03:07:44.06 --> 03:07:51.82
jobs and I just remember he looked at me and he said I don't have any skills that's what they think

2552
03:07:51.82 --> 03:07:56.30
I mean he was dead serious and you're thinking what I mean I know that you're not gonna go work

2553
03:07:56.30 --> 03:08:03.02
for someone and be hanging out in bushes and kicking down doors most likely but what the skills these

2554
03:08:03.02 --> 03:08:10.78
guys do have I mean most of them are are very intelligent critical thinkers analytical

2555
03:08:11.82 --> 03:08:16.22
problem solvers think outside of the box can make decisions quickly

2556
03:08:16.22 --> 03:08:24.94
that is a lot of really great attributes that many organizations and civilian world would want and so

2557
03:08:25.82 --> 03:08:31.82
again just to speak to I you know it's that loss of identity and it's like I've been shooting guns

2558
03:08:31.82 --> 03:08:34.54
and busting down doors what what else do I do?

2559
03:08:38.22 --> 03:08:45.10
one of my first put to chief said he there was a old Vietnam seal and he was a male man now

2560
03:08:45.10 --> 03:08:50.14
and they would go over there and like drink beer or whatever it is house and he'd tell stories

2561
03:08:50.14 --> 03:08:59.42
about nom nice and he had this picture on the wall and it was like a shop from behind like a picture

2562
03:08:59.42 --> 03:09:06.14
of of a guy's back and the guy's the guy whose back you see is clearly a Vietnam seal with a floppy

2563
03:09:06.14 --> 03:09:11.34
hat and a stoner and his web gear on and his jungle cammy top and his blue jeans and he

2564
03:09:11.34 --> 03:09:17.82
standing in front of like a corporate desk and the corporate desk there's the boss guys looking

2565
03:09:17.82 --> 03:09:22.22
at him in the caption underneath this I'm sorry sir we don't have any jobs for appointment here

2566
03:09:24.46 --> 03:09:28.78
which is true but to your point and believe me I see this all the time I work with companies

2567
03:09:28.78 --> 03:09:34.06
all over the country and all over the world actually and they absolutely need the individuals

2568
03:09:34.06 --> 03:09:39.10
that have these kind of attributes that you're talking about and there is absolutely a new mission

2569
03:09:39.10 --> 03:09:44.14
when you get done with the military to go out in the civilian world and have an impact make people's

2570
03:09:44.14 --> 03:09:49.42
lives better and build great products and build great companies and and do great things and that is

2571
03:09:49.42 --> 03:09:56.70
absolutely available and you are needed in the in the civilian world and that's the way it is

2572
03:09:58.06 --> 03:10:05.34
we need them too all right like our country needs people with this kind of experience spread

2573
03:10:05.34 --> 03:10:09.66
throughout our our country spread throughout our companies spread throughout our communities spread

2574
03:10:09.66 --> 03:10:14.54
throughout our our neighborhoods and one of the things that makes San Diego such a great town is

2575
03:10:14.54 --> 03:10:19.74
it's it's a military there's it's a military town you've got this just underpinnings of San Diego

2576
03:10:19.74 --> 03:10:24.62
the foundation is strong it's the same where I live in Jacksonville beach I mean my my neighbor

2577
03:10:24.62 --> 03:10:29.26
two doors down is a top gun instructor I mean these things are just normal around

2578
03:10:29.26 --> 03:10:35.18
us and it's great they're just good people that are just you know this talk about you know the

2579
03:10:35.18 --> 03:10:40.46
greatest generation coming back to America and just doing great stuff getting educated and working

2580
03:10:40.46 --> 03:10:47.02
their asses off and building America into America and you know we need more of that and so we need

2581
03:10:47.02 --> 03:10:53.58
we need the transition is it's to echo her point I mean it's just sucks I mean don't underestimate

2582
03:10:53.58 --> 03:10:59.82
it under any circumstances it can happen to you it will happen to you it will be terrible and and

2583
03:10:59.82 --> 03:11:04.62
just now that you know it's common brace for it a little bit take it easy on yourself build out

2584
03:11:04.62 --> 03:11:10.94
some support structures around you you know stuff like that and we just this is going to

2585
03:11:10.94 --> 03:11:17.26
require something that is not kind of normal this day and age it's going to require us to kind of

2586
03:11:17.26 --> 03:11:25.26
work together you know like how to support transitioning folks better how to kind of build stronger

2587
03:11:25.26 --> 03:11:30.86
communities in the real world how to like that's what we need we don't you don't need guys coming

2588
03:11:30.86 --> 03:11:35.74
out and it's like hey you don't you need to do you need to be an influencer on Instagram right

2589
03:11:35.74 --> 03:11:44.70
like no you know how about not that right and and so you know it's it's it's difficult it's difficult

2590
03:11:44.70 --> 03:11:50.94
and and we have to keep having the conversation that that's why I respect you and then and I

2591
03:11:50.94 --> 03:11:57.02
respect this long form podcast stuff that you do because it's it forces people you know it's not

2592
03:11:57.02 --> 03:12:03.10
just soundbites it's like hey here's the story this is nothing's as simple as it looks on someone's

2593
03:12:03.10 --> 03:12:09.98
feed and you know that that's kind of what real life is like and and I think that we we need more of

2594
03:12:09.98 --> 03:12:19.58
that not less totally agree well speaking along form I've kept you in here for over three hours

2595
03:12:20.54 --> 03:12:25.26

and thanks for what you're continuing to do build and go rock and forming communities out there

2597
03:12:31.18 --> 03:12:35.82
real communities I can see this look in your eye when you when you start saying that and and I get it

2598
03:12:35.82 --> 03:12:42.14
man and for me it's a lot through jiu jitsu but look that that's a real thing and getting people together

2599
03:12:42.14 --> 03:12:50.30

thanks to your kids as well for what they've gone through and of course Chad um thanks for your service bro

2605
03:13:36.38 --> 03:13:47.82
we won't forget amen thank you and with that Sarah Wilkinson and Jason McCarthy have

2606
03:13:47.82 --> 03:14:00.62
left the building and echo Charles we need to go a little bit old school I think on this one for

2607
03:14:01.18 --> 03:14:10.46
the decompression right so if you've never listened this before the original purpose of

2608
03:14:11.66 --> 03:14:16.86
when we would get done with the podcast echo Charles and I would just kind of start talking about

2609
03:14:16.86 --> 03:14:24.46
stuff for a little while it was to decompress from a heavy subject as we started doing podcast

2610
03:14:24.46 --> 03:14:29.66
I started hitting some heavy subjects along the way this we would originally just kind of start talking

2611
03:14:29.66 --> 03:14:35.42
and I would just kind of let echo talk for a little bit while I did the decompression because I'm

2612
03:14:35.42 --> 03:14:42.22
usually the one that's all wrapped up in whatever subject is we're talking about so certainly

2613
03:14:42.22 --> 03:14:51.34
a in need of a little decompression after that one just a just a very tough subject and and

2614
03:14:52.22 --> 03:14:59.10
that's why we're talking about it right we're talking about it as you know Sarah said something

2615
03:14:59.10 --> 03:15:04.94
that she doesn't want anyone else to have to go through and that's why we talk about these things

2616
03:15:04.94 --> 03:15:17.58
so for a little decompression I'll let you talk a little bit echo Charles we we want people to

2617
03:15:17.58 --> 03:15:22.94
take care of themselves it's true so you you like it's weird because so that there's so many

2618
03:15:22.94 --> 03:15:29.42
mysteries to the brain so and with your body like your physical your other parts of your body

2619
03:15:29.42 --> 03:15:35.34
it's like less of a mystery right so like yeah you go in you know you're in a combat scenario you get

2620
03:15:35.34 --> 03:15:41.42
shot in the abdomen then it's like okay it's gonna be pretty straightforward as far as hey can we save

2621
03:15:41.42 --> 03:15:45.90
this guy can we not you know all the stuff and like he can bleed out he there's all these things and

2622
03:15:45.90 --> 03:15:50.22
then there's these you know you can take specific actions and then hopefully we can save them all this

2623
03:15:51.02 --> 03:15:55.02
you get shot on the leg or something while you're running or you blow out your knee or something

2624
03:15:55.02 --> 03:15:59.98
it's like okay it's broken he can't run anymore it's like pretty straightforward but the brain

2625
03:15:59.98 --> 03:16:03.42
gets damaged and one way or another it's kind of like there's no telling what's gonna happen

2626
03:16:03.42 --> 03:16:09.82
a lot of the time you know and you don't know when either it's it is the brain is the mysterious

2627
03:16:10.78 --> 03:16:15.58
part of the anatomy right now and nerves right and I don't really know how they work it's

2628
03:16:15.58 --> 03:16:21.74
very hard to like repair them and and then yeah as we said you take that brain and rattle around

2629
03:16:21.74 --> 03:16:28.14
inside of a inside of your skull over and over again we don't know what it's gonna do but we know

2630
03:16:28.14 --> 03:16:34.22
it's not good we know that yeah and then you have to make it kind of in a way we're okay remember

2631
03:16:34.22 --> 03:16:40.22
cursed the NS yes right so she she got jammed out she got injured and she still had her leg you know

2632
03:16:40.22 --> 03:16:44.78
she's she's doing this thing and then but she's constantly being checked in upon you know checked on

2633
03:16:44.78 --> 03:16:49.42
and be like okay and then over time they were like hey okay we're at a point where we got to

2634
03:16:49.42 --> 03:16:53.50
make this very specific decision and we know what could and you know all the stuff and it was

2635
03:16:53.50 --> 03:16:56.86
pretty it was pretty clear and then you make the decision but that's an example of

2636
03:16:57.50 --> 03:17:02.70
incurring an injury and then it's still having lasting effects last and effects last and until you

2637
03:17:02.70 --> 03:17:10.06
got it you know either risk actually dying or risk a huge or bigger injuries or just say

2638
03:17:10.06 --> 03:17:16.78
top it off or amputated and you know remember her talking about she knows she because she could still

2639
03:17:16.78 --> 03:17:25.34
walk yeah yeah and she was taking her last walk on the beach in the sand yeah exactly right

2640
03:17:25.34 --> 03:17:31.98
but a perfect example of like you can incur the injury it's still handle still you know go about

2641
03:17:31.98 --> 03:17:35.42
your business sure you jumped up here and they're here and they're there and then but the injury

2642
03:17:35.42 --> 03:17:40.22
is still progressing yeah it's getting you know getting worse yeah and then you got and mean

2643
03:17:40.22 --> 03:17:43.74
well but the thing is again for your your other parts of your body it's kind of like there's kind

2644
03:17:43.74 --> 03:17:48.38
of a protocol you can check in and be like okay for the brain so mysterious it's like we

2645
03:17:48.38 --> 03:17:53.50
can try and we are kind of trying to do that but it's so mysterious that it's not as cut in dry

2646
03:17:53.50 --> 03:17:59.10
like that and it's the same exact thing he incurred all these injuries at some point and that

2647
03:17:59.10 --> 03:18:04.46
thing just keeps lasting and lasting getting worse and worse and worse you know until it gets you

2648
03:18:06.06 --> 03:18:10.14
it's hard to like get a grip on exactly what's happening

2649
03:18:10.14 --> 03:18:16.14
you just crazy though it's the unknown frontier of the human body probably the most unknown

2650
03:18:16.54 --> 03:18:22.06
frontier of the human body yeah the nerves and the brain and there's so many illusions too even

2651
03:18:22.06 --> 03:18:28.38
like with yourself where you can be like I just do this in this situation or that situation or I

2652
03:18:28.38 --> 03:18:32.78
would never choose to do that but you get in a certain like situation you do some stuff that's

2653
03:18:32.78 --> 03:18:38.78
real unexplainable or only explainable later even though you thought from before hand you see

2654
03:18:38.78 --> 03:18:43.18
you were you were so convinced of something and then afterwards you're like oh she also

2655
03:18:43.18 --> 03:18:47.74
surprised on what you did you know kind of thing so it's like so there's this big illusion like

2656
03:18:47.74 --> 03:18:52.22
it's like oh yeah you could just make the decision not to or whatever but it's like back to

2657
03:18:52.22 --> 03:19:01.82
the work like that lots of factors come into play well we do want people to like I said

2658
03:19:01.82 --> 03:19:06.62
want people to take care of themselves yeah and the ones around them and around them but we got

2659
03:19:06.62 --> 03:19:12.46
a kind of like the analogy goes with the the plane and the oxygen got to put the oxygen on your

2660
03:19:12.46 --> 03:19:16.38
own face before you put it on your kids it's true so so you got to do a little something to

2661
03:19:16.38 --> 03:19:21.02
kind of keep yourself in the game Sarah mentioned something where he said oh I don't have any

2662
03:19:21.02 --> 03:19:24.70
skills right and he's talking about getting a job or something like this and I was thinking yeah

2663
03:19:24.70 --> 03:19:30.22
you know I can see why someone might think that off like for at first but the fact is you have

2664
03:19:30.22 --> 03:19:36.22
a lot of skills because one of the main skills is straight up capability in all these different ways

2665
03:19:36.22 --> 03:19:41.18
where you know you can learn this specific thing or learn that specific trade and all this other

2666
03:19:41.18 --> 03:19:45.18
stuff but if someone who's just a more capable person across the board that guy's going to excel in

2667
03:19:45.18 --> 03:19:52.06
those skills for sure so in my opinion that's an important thing to be capable and to stay capable

2668
03:19:52.06 --> 03:20:01.82
sure that's on this path of capability hopefully it takes a minute some heavies it happens that's

2669
03:20:01.82 --> 03:20:06.78
kind of like you mentioned you just do and you just if you're going hard are you not going to get

2670
03:20:06.78 --> 03:20:13.02
ding the no you are going to get that's kind of the nature of going hard same saying no just like

2671
03:20:13.02 --> 03:20:17.10
and work out just like with anything else but don't worry supplementation will help us all

2672
03:20:18.30 --> 03:20:24.94
through those dings dance so anyway chocolate supplements a lot more you've seen chocolate supplements

2673
03:20:25.66 --> 03:20:30.46
so first thing we're going to be compressing you know you made me chuckle a little bit we're trying

2674
03:20:30.46 --> 03:20:36.14
over here decompression okay yeah so chocolate has a new era of energy drinks straight up healthy for

2675
03:20:36.14 --> 03:20:41.50
you I know we don't need quite health and energy drinks in the same thing didn't you still no we do

2676
03:20:41.50 --> 03:20:49.98
know we do now new era discipline go any different flavors best flavors mango kind of by far

2677
03:20:49.98 --> 03:20:56.70
to pass and that's like an activity and that's saying a lot because the orange is freaking good

2678
03:20:56.70 --> 03:21:01.58
you know on the sour out like these are like good flavor they taste good but like mango is just

2679
03:21:01.58 --> 03:21:07.90
so much better it's like crazy it's saying a lot you're saying yeah the good thing is that these

2680
03:21:07.90 --> 03:21:13.66
drinks they taste different you you got a some people might not like mango probably a small number

2681
03:21:13.66 --> 03:21:19.98
people some people might not like orange some people might not like sour apple sniper some people

2682
03:21:19.98 --> 03:21:27.98
might not like jockel Palmer some people might not like whatever so the recommendation is try

2683
03:21:27.98 --> 03:21:36.14
on try one see what you like yeah let me know but let echo Charles know if his signature flavor is

2684
03:21:36.14 --> 03:21:41.18
the best well it senses factually the best you love your flavor the best well you ever drink another

2685
03:21:41.18 --> 03:21:47.18
different kind yes yeah okay see that's what's weird only because I don't want to come on I

2686
03:21:47.18 --> 03:21:51.26
don't have any I got a cup of tea and right in them and you know there's that but if you had

2687
03:21:51.26 --> 03:21:59.02
all flavors in a fridge every for one year yeah I can do one year yeah and I was restocking years

2688
03:21:59.82 --> 03:22:05.66
whatever after replace a sour apple sniper you would never have to know here's a thing I could do

2689
03:22:05.66 --> 03:22:11.10
one year but in the spirit of you know nature and all that stuff like if you're eating steak

2690
03:22:11.10 --> 03:22:16.38
every single night and someone offered you to throw off the path of the of the mango man in

2691
03:22:16.38 --> 03:22:21.42
the spirit of variety yes okay for sure well that's you know that's the I think that's natural

2692
03:22:21.42 --> 03:22:29.66
I'm pretty sure I would only drink jockel Palmer because it takes so good to me yeah but I also only

2693
03:22:29.66 --> 03:22:35.02
stakes so there you go see because you're different all right so we got a drink is what you're saying

2694
03:22:35.02 --> 03:22:41.10
it doesn't matter what flavor you choose to drink at any particular time regardless if mango is the best

2695
03:22:41.10 --> 03:22:47.58
flavor it's all healthy for you so you drink in the energy drink you get in the front end the

2696
03:22:47.58 --> 03:22:54.62
energy a little boost that we sometimes want boom but you get the health benefits as well as

2697
03:22:54.62 --> 03:22:59.18
opposed to the poison benefits or lack of benefits or whatever that's your next year on a

2698
03:22:59.18 --> 03:23:05.58
summer adventure either way discipline go you can get this at wall wall vitamin shop

2702
03:23:22.22 --> 03:23:25.42
when you're lifting hard doing jiu-jitsu like you don't want to worry about the joints if you

2703
03:23:25.42 --> 03:23:29.26
don't want to worry about your joints this is the one that we need I don't want to worry about

2704
03:23:29.26 --> 03:23:33.02
that joints yeah it's gonna be pretty rare you can want to worry about your joints but I don't know

2705
03:23:33.02 --> 03:23:36.46
some people are more in touch with that kind stuff and that's cool too either way

2706
03:23:36.46 --> 03:23:42.46
join our her and super krill oil will make sure that they're still in the game longevity man

2707
03:23:42.46 --> 03:23:49.90
hey if you had the greens yet no well we have greens now all right and decide to come up with a creative

2708
03:23:49.90 --> 03:23:59.50
name jockel greens we made some very good greens and so you can check those out to live you if

2709
03:23:59.50 --> 03:24:08.30
you don't eat enough vegetables like me or fruits like me yeah now you can put in a scoop yeah that's

2710
03:24:08.30 --> 03:24:14.38
good and and again you know true jockel style apparently you're making these things taste good

2711
03:24:14.38 --> 03:24:19.66
yeah which is very not hard core of you by the way but it is very efficient and when it's a little

2712
03:24:19.66 --> 03:24:24.62
it's real low drag it's also results related right we're not trying to feed not trying to get you

2713
03:24:24.62 --> 03:24:30.22
to drink something that tastes like junk yeah and then you don't drink it because it tastes like junk yeah

2714
03:24:30.22 --> 03:24:35.74
why would we do that you're not trying to offer up another element of resistance in a good

2715
03:24:35.74 --> 03:24:40.94
path that we're all on yeah yeah it's true that's a good move also vitamin D3 cold war immunity

2716
03:24:40.94 --> 03:24:46.62
stuff this is essential so don't forget about that kind stuff also mok he's talked about stakes

2717
03:24:46.62 --> 03:24:52.22
I get it but sometimes you want to extra this back on the strawberry path right now you are going

2718
03:24:52.22 --> 03:24:57.10
hardcore strawberry for like a week and a half I was going hardcore peanut butter for at least a

2719
03:24:57.10 --> 03:25:01.42
month what's the what's your normal probably putting anything in there in the little banana

2720
03:25:01.42 --> 03:25:08.38
little whatever what are you just straight mok mok and some variety of milk could be cooking up milk

2721
03:25:09.02 --> 03:25:15.02
could be almond milk could be the milk could be the milk could be the milk milk milk milk milk milk

2722
03:25:15.02 --> 03:25:20.46
milk but yeah mix it up with one of those and they all taste legit they all have their own little

2723
03:25:20.46 --> 03:25:25.98
sshsh you know yeah you don't know my protocol watch up in freaking on and it's freaking solid and

2724
03:25:25.98 --> 03:25:30.62
it tastes good I don't know though so is it normal like what do you let's say you had a salad like not

2725
03:25:30.62 --> 03:25:37.50
like a side salad but up a rope us salad you know you stick salad chicken salad whatever

2726
03:25:37.50 --> 03:25:42.30
what do you drink with that what's the norm what pairs with that that don't say I know you can say

2727
03:25:42.30 --> 03:25:47.34
water I know okay what's the jam you don't want to say water all right well water kind of

2728
03:25:47.34 --> 03:25:50.94
goes with everything you always get what at the restaurant thinking to give you the water first

2729
03:25:50.94 --> 03:25:55.90
that's the given but what is you know what's the jam your story your thing is not going anywhere

2730
03:25:55.90 --> 03:26:00.94
swear where you go with this okay you're a lot of my what I pair with a big salad it's called

2731
03:26:00.94 --> 03:26:10.38
the big salad chicken very robust salad um mok shake but just a plain one though plain like

2732
03:26:10.38 --> 03:26:14.22
not usually I had a banana or frozen banana there or whatever not I don't know whatever

2733
03:26:14.22 --> 03:26:19.66
so I'll go the peanut butter peanut butter chocolate and then milk or the almond milk or whatever

2734
03:26:19.66 --> 03:26:25.34
just you know you don't add the oatmeal or bananas or whatever if you want to make it all luxury or whatever

2735
03:26:25.34 --> 03:26:31.66
you can see but it like pairs nicely right off all right well either way these things again

2736
03:26:31.66 --> 03:26:38.14
jockelfuel dot com subscribe if you want to influx you know where you don't got to remember

2737
03:26:38.14 --> 03:26:43.50
to reorder or run out and all that stuff you don't have to remember you don't have to pay shipping

2738
03:26:43.50 --> 03:26:50.86
oh yeah those are two real solid elements true so we mentioned origin us a dot com

2739
03:26:52.06 --> 03:26:57.50
this is where you can get your American made denim yeah kind of a big deal no it's a real big deal

2740
03:26:57.50 --> 03:27:01.42
yeah when you kind of go down the line it's like sure you get in good jeans I can't it that's this

2741
03:27:01.42 --> 03:27:07.50
good it's great actually but I hear something crazy when we first looked into making these jeans

2742
03:27:07.50 --> 03:27:15.74
hmm we were talking to people we were talking to people in the fashion industry legit

2743
03:27:15.74 --> 03:27:19.50
I know yes I understand you don't much they wanted us to charge for a pair of jeans American

2744
03:27:19.50 --> 03:27:24.54
made jeans you don't look the value placed on American 100% American made jeans were taken guess

2745
03:27:24.54 --> 03:27:31.66
I'm much 118 I'm not kidding you they said the good market price

2746
03:27:31.66 --> 03:27:42.70
$450 for a pair of jeans this was like a New York city with fashion paper and I like

2747
03:27:42.70 --> 03:27:49.26
kicked Pete under the table like but I started $450 for a pair of jeans no that's not happening

2748
03:27:49.90 --> 03:27:53.82
and we walked out I'm like that's not a big six not happy I was like he's a calm down you know

2749
03:27:53.82 --> 03:27:58.62
I was kind of losing it because you know I already don't like fashion people in the first place now they want

2750
03:27:58.62 --> 03:28:03.10
to be a person charge 400 because they're trying to they're trying to keep the control the market

2751
03:28:03.10 --> 03:28:08.22
right trying to keep that thing elevated because they want to charge 450 for their pair of jeans

2752
03:28:08.22 --> 03:28:14.54
yeah but you know the whole idea of charging that much for jeans like whatever they're doing

2753
03:28:14.54 --> 03:28:19.58
there like it's not a matter of like hey we got a you know and it makes this logistical

2754
03:28:19.58 --> 03:28:24.06
sense not that they're doing something oh no they're inflating the prices yeah for a reason like

2755
03:28:24.06 --> 03:28:27.74
they're doing what's their thing what are they doing like that thing I think I'll tell you what they're

2756
03:28:27.74 --> 03:28:33.34
doing they know that people want to buy American made stuff they know they can't make it they want

2757
03:28:33.34 --> 03:28:36.54
us to price it out of the markets then after worry yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

2758
03:28:36.54 --> 03:28:41.42
yeah that's what we've been doing that makes sense what I'm playing there games well the good news

2759
03:28:41.42 --> 03:28:48.22
is it doesn't cost 450 999 whatever you should so boom there you go you also got boots on there

2760
03:28:48.22 --> 03:28:54.70
yeah by the way saying American made 100% bringing back the industry by the way expanding like

2761
03:28:54.70 --> 03:29:01.42
cheese Luis for us cheese Luis goes but I'm saying there's a bit of there's a lot going on

2762
03:29:01.42 --> 03:29:07.74
there's a lot going on there's a bit of conflict that's a bit of a lot of things yeah but yes so

2763
03:29:07.74 --> 03:29:11.42
ordinary USA there's a lot of cool stuff and you did so stuff on there as well yeah you get that

2764
03:29:11.42 --> 03:29:15.18
key yeah you get the key if you're getting back into you just to where you get your staying in

2765
03:29:15.18 --> 03:29:20.54
digits you want another key okay I want to come you did it not you talked about with Jason

2768
03:29:32.14 --> 03:29:36.38
good take the high ground or the high ground will take you

2769
03:29:37.42 --> 03:29:44.06
swirking your shirts and hoodies and hats and whatnot some shorts on there utility surfing swimming

2770
03:29:44.06 --> 03:29:50.70
cruising left in jiu jie I said it all of it everything they're a little at hybrid or whatever

2771
03:29:51.34 --> 03:29:55.02
anyway got some shorts on there too you know we talk of shorts with cargo pockets no

2772
03:29:55.74 --> 03:30:01.10
well you can't be wearing them for swimming or jiu jitsu if they have the pocket on them the big

2773
03:30:01.10 --> 03:30:08.14
pockets for the cargo cargo pockets no you can have a little cargo pocket on there not a freaking baggy

2774
03:30:08.14 --> 03:30:16.78
like from the gap store cargo pocket from 1994 it does not have that no but the hate like the

2775
03:30:16.78 --> 03:30:20.94
the pocket that you stick your hands into on the front you can't do jiu jitsu with those and swimming's

2776
03:30:20.94 --> 03:30:28.06
not recommended oh yes you can trust me can well you might be able to it's not off

2777
03:30:28.06 --> 03:30:32.38
yeah well maybe I'll put like zip can you put zippers on them that would be making a little bit better

2778
03:30:32.38 --> 03:30:41.42
we need to do a pair of shorts with a slim pocket on the leg no wait and I think these are

2779
03:30:41.42 --> 03:30:46.46
yeah I don't have to double check but they have like the pocket is kind of it breeds like through

2780
03:30:46.46 --> 03:30:51.98
so the water can pass through I'm wearing them right now they do have that but that still see

2781
03:30:52.54 --> 03:30:56.38
but you know what I'm doing right now working I'm paed get their good their excellent for podcast

2782
03:30:56.38 --> 03:31:02.38
yeah right there excellent for cruising for sure swimming is marginal because that even though the

2783
03:31:02.38 --> 03:31:07.34
water is made to drain out of them it's still your there's big pockets hold water we're not

2784
03:31:07.34 --> 03:31:12.22
setting we're not swimming in the English channel yeah actually no no that's a thing so yeah so there's

2785
03:31:12.22 --> 03:31:18.30
that and then jiu jitsu you know your toes get in the pond there or whatever so let's redesign

2786
03:31:18.30 --> 03:31:25.98
yeah sir I always didn't redesign well are we lagging we're working on that one okay no it's

2787
03:31:25.98 --> 03:31:31.98
it's a working progress or whatever but the good thing about this is swimming jiu jitsu I know

2788
03:31:31.98 --> 03:31:37.18
you toes get stuck in there and it's true but it's they're not ideal because really what's ideal

2789
03:31:37.18 --> 03:31:41.18
for jiu jitsu really it's like spats on our ashguard same thing we're swimming what's ideal for

2790
03:31:41.18 --> 03:31:45.50
swimming go limpics check it out that's what's ideal for swimming okay a lot of us sometimes we don't

2791
03:31:45.50 --> 03:31:49.26
on a way that can't stuff when we go swimming yeah some of us I don't understand if we're not

2792
03:31:49.26 --> 03:31:55.58
swimming though English channel I get it we can jump in the in the in the surf zone if you if we're

2793
03:31:55.58 --> 03:32:00.78
just cruising right now and then we just find yourself at the beach I don't know or like

2794
03:32:00.78 --> 03:32:06.38
frickless go body surfing you can wear those shorts as I'm saying yes and they're gonna work great

2795
03:32:06.38 --> 03:32:13.74
they're gonna be acceptable very it's not optimal they'll be appropriate oh but that now they're

2796
03:32:13.74 --> 03:32:19.42
really good for normal life yeah which is what I wear them for but if I'm gonna roll I'm gonna put

this is what this is what this is what's fired up there's funny parts in that book

2826
03:35:25.34 --> 03:35:31.50
right and she she's outside the glass right I'm in the I'm in the room right she's outside the glass

2827
03:35:31.50 --> 03:35:35.26
and I'm watching her and like I would read a funny line and I can see her she's like laughing

2828
03:35:35.26 --> 03:35:39.42
she laughing like laughing like laughing at me like nodding her head and then there's a

2829
03:35:39.42 --> 03:35:43.98
couple point parts in the book that are kind of like fired up like they're gonna go and she was

2830
03:35:43.98 --> 03:35:48.30
literally raising your hands like I look at her like raising her and like they're gonna go

2831
03:35:49.50 --> 03:35:55.10
and then that was day one lots of setup you know you can kind of get into the characters a little bit

2832
03:35:55.10 --> 03:36:03.58
day two stuff starts getting a little bit going sideways day two Deb openly weeping that I can

2833
03:36:03.58 --> 03:36:11.34
visually watch her crying that's like reading like the some parts of the story that are heavy

2834
03:36:11.34 --> 03:36:16.30
so final spin if you don't know what that's all about check it out dang that's crazy

2835
03:36:16.30 --> 03:36:20.30
it's like like she was like your little audience she had an audience of one yeah yeah yeah

2836
03:36:20.30 --> 03:36:23.90
and you know what check this out she's supposed to be a professional they know really

2837
03:36:23.90 --> 03:36:28.06
like no that's perspective Deb she is a professional she did a great job and I was much

2838
03:36:28.06 --> 03:36:35.66
appreciated she's not supposed to be in there laughing she ring and crying right that's not right yeah

2839
03:36:35.66 --> 03:36:37.42
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

2840
03:36:37.42 --> 03:36:42.14
would you be stoked if your doctors doing a surgery on you like high five and then laughing like

2841
03:36:42.14 --> 03:36:49.74
not right right you're gonna be stoked on that but I was definitely stoked yeah it was

2842
03:36:50.86 --> 03:36:56.30
think about it's like a you're right it was an audience or one and she's not supposed to be

2843
03:36:56.30 --> 03:37:02.06
showing emotions and she's in there getting emotional all emotions revealed so if you want to

2844
03:37:02.06 --> 03:37:10.06
feel some of those emotions here about it also did a little the additional the additional commentary

2845
03:37:10.06 --> 03:37:16.14
for the audio track is with good deal Dave Burke because he read it and he interviewed me and

2846
