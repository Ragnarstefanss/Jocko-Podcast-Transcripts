and you let them come up with the plan echo we're going to protect this we're going to fill in the podcast it's going to be underwater we're going to need four cameras because we got four guests good that's it that's all I'm going to tell you now you're going to figure out what kind of housing and what kind of tripod and how you're going to do it and what you're going to run wires now we're going to talk when we're moving we're moving you're going to figure all that stuff out a mission and then analysis the mission a mission is task and purpose clearly indicating the action to be taken and the reason for the action best the mission task and purpose clearly indicating the action to be taken and the reason for the action the commander must understand the mission intent and concept of operation one and two levels higher this understanding makes it possible to exercise disciplined initiative and it's kind of implicit here that not only must you understand the the concept of operation and the intent and the mission one and two levels above you but man you got to make sure you understand the broad strategic mission as well everyone needs to understand these things and the classic example I'll use is when in in the battle for money to think everybody needs to know that what we're trying to do is provide security for the populace so everyone's got to have that in the back of their mind when you're going out and there's civilians and you know that what you need to do is protect them It meant have a plan man you know like even just I mean this is a common one where it's like yeah plan out your day or plan out your week or whatever or even like it kind of applies to everything really like anything that you want to do well it's like you're going to have some sort of a. Solid plan that you know varying levels of flexibility obviously depends on what it is but like even if you want to you want to lose weight or you want to. because when you think about it and I sort of realize this when you talk about like training whether it be police or even fighters and stuff like that where if you think of high level performance like industries we'll say the NFL saying right millions of dollars per person by the way NBA whatever think about their situation it's like how much of their time do they spend actually performing very little prepared to train in all day every day off season spring time no matter you know the seasons what 13 games on mean while they're training training training training training training and then what kind of training do they do it's all rehearsals essentially I mean sure there's some academic stuff for sure but as far as when you go to practice as a football player basketball player what are you doing rehearsals all day going full speed actually and maybe you don't crush your joints or nothing like that like you can kind of get by like you can like all just why I was just warming up a little bit more like my this shoulder right here is like just this little real specific part I know I get that right there too if I do this is not specific weighted dips I get this so I like I like these candy bars I don't eat them all the time actually I barely eat candy bars you know like a king size candy bar most things with peanut butter is gonna be you know like kind of go to when I do go to those so those are kind of like a dessert right so if you're in business and you have the opportunity to take out a competitor but whatever that competitor employees a bunch of people in a certain area and you take them out well what does that do to your reputation know how and you just shut them I like that that's the kind of thing you need to think about what think about the other effects to for lack of a better word the civilian population and it's something the military you get trained very specifically to consider all the time that's that's why I wanted to bring it up some of the things that they point out inside of the inside of the civilian considerations ethnic dynamics organizations of influence patterns leaders and influencers which I know you're one of those right an influencer and then economic environment so those are some of the things you need to think about getting into the course of action development course of action development the purpose of a course of action development is to determine one or more ways to accomplish the mission consistent with the battalion commanders intent and you don't need to worry about the commanders the time battalion intent if you didn't get the mission from them so anyway again that's like how not to deal with a narcissist you know like like if you if I were to be like hey chocolate you're freaking you're you're you give up too easy or something like that right sometimes that helps people when you're like oh I'm looking at this problem I see the premiere solution some of the criteria for a course of action should be suitable if executed the course of action accomplishes the mission legally and ethically while consistent with the battalion commanders concept intent that's like one of those obvious things you're talking about like yes the course of action should complete the mission should be feasible meaning the company has the technical and tactical skills and resources to accomplish the course of action with the available time space resources and availability abilities that one's real obvious acceptable military advantage gained by executing the course of action must justify the cost in resources especially casually yes distinguishable this one's a little bit important if more than one course of action is developed does it differ significantly from the other solutions so is it truly different or is it six and one half does any other and believe me and watch people fight about six and one half does any other all the time and is it complete does the course of action cover the operational factors of who what where went why so those are the things you're looking at yeah that that sounds like a good way to deal whether you're not adding fuel to the fire nope in fact you're extinguishing the fire because fuel to the fire is positive or negative reaction it's any reaction anything that feeds the idea that like what I say and do affects the world so hugely you know so this person getting mad or happy or impressed or whatever like any like strong reaction is like hell and maybe it hits you know check you get to this point here where it is identify tentative decision decisive point decisive points good words with the doctoral term decisive point is where you it's like a thing that happens a point that you reach where now you should win right now you have like a marked advantage over the enemy different for different situations you know when you've got you know when Dean Lister grabs a hold of your leg it's a decisive point Getting you know you got a meal prep you got workout prep like you're going to know what you're going to do unless you're like one of these instinctive training guys which is like way down the line pretty much knowing can do it. I got burpees I got pull ups I got you know like I typically know how many you know I even quite frankly we talk about this lot I even know how much rest I'm going to take him between you know but if you if you look at this it shows you the level of detail that they are asking people to think through this information you know just just page after page of terrain analysis you produce several specific conclusions listed below batten support by fire assault fire positions engagement areas and ambush sites immediate immediate objectives asset out locations such as enemy personnel is going on and on and on and then it goes in the five aspects of military weather visibility wins precipitation crowd cover temperature and humidity it just details each one of those and then it goes into analysis of the enemy jumping through a little section of this analyzing the enemy answers the question what is the enemy doing in a why the commander answers what is the composition and strength of the enemy force what are the capabilities of their weapons and other systems what is the location of current and probable enemy positions what is the enemy's most probable course of action are they going to defend reinforced attack withdrawal delay and then you start talking about assumptions about the enemy and then you start talking about the doctrinal analysis of the enemy which is what you try to figure out how the enemy is going to fight you then composition of the enemy then disposition of the enemy then the strength of the enemy then the capabilities of the enemy and then recent activities of the enemy you see where I'm going with this yeah because a real narcissist literally can't see why like they're not correct in the way they're thinking about themselves so it's like they for real think that everyone else sees the same thing as they do you know it's like it's literally that's what they think so when you tell if you were narcissist and I was like you know so it's so sketch as far as like the differentiator is like a normal person if someone's like hey like you're you're kind of a narcissist a normal person would be like
