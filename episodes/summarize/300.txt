but we also saved lives and that's the truth enriching global corporations and enriching the military industrial complex that enrichment certainly influences behaviors right it influences someone that's making a weapon system to try and make their weapon system better to try and make better body armor there's a there's someone right now as we speak that is trying to make better body armor and part of the reason that trying to make it is to protect the American soldier but guess what they got a mortgage to pay and they want to make better body armor because they want to make more money and if they can make better body armor then the US government goes wow that's lighter it's stronger it provides more protection we're going to buy it it's not that the person is just thinking about money but the money that the the two goals are aligned there's a simultaneous drive that is that is moving behavior in the right direction and oftentimes like I just use that example body armor they're aligned with this company out there acme body armor they want to make best body armor and they want to make it do they want to protect Americans yes they do do they want to make money yes they do so I have no problem with that if they're aligned it works out perfectly here's the problem the problem is if they're out of alignment that's where it can become awful and that's what we need to watch out for what is the driving force behind going to war are we going to work is the right thing to do are we going to war for benevolent reasons are we positive that it will have a positive impact that will offset the natural negative impacts of work because when you go on a war there's going to be negative impacts people are going to die people are going to get wounded and is the positive impact going to offset that negative impact is it going to help stability in the world is there a strategic benefit for us as America if we're going to war for those reasons because there's going to be a strategic advantage because it protects our national security because it's going to be truly good for the people on the ground that need protection that need help to get out from a tyrannical or evil regime and there are evil regimes and if you don't think there's evil regimes you're wrong because there's people in the world there's regimes in the world that will systematically rape little kids if yeah if echo ever goes into combat he's gonna be like he's gonna keep the point of the earth well that that's something that does have some value same same because I think a lot of people we care about like at the very least a little bit about what it looks like same same put on the Delta 68 it's not like I didn't look in the mirror I was like it's not like I was like you sure they fit and then just kind of walked out and just I looked in the mirror a little bit and in fact I remember what I read shirted and football and we're warming up for the game you know you can you can suit up for the game when you read shirt for football and the coach said he was like dang echo looks good and is uniform he's not ready to play but he looks good and is uniform that could be also a foreshadden of your tactical but the fact that matter is it's true that profits certainly drive corporations to do things to to make products and defense companies certainly get rich during wars as we just heard from smedly balder those totally true totally true and just like smedly balder like you and I were saying that that's like one part of the argument that's not the only driver that's not the only driver and I mean for the corporate example I work with hundreds of companies and Dave you work with hundreds companies and the companies make money they make a lot of money and they are certainly driven by profits in some way but they're also making products that people want and they're making products that people need and they're employing people and they're making products that make people's lives better that's what's happening in the vast majority of cases no better example than medical device companies pharmaceutical companies and I've worked with scores of medical device companies I've worked with scores of pharmaceutical companies over the last decade and some of those companies that I've worked with that you've worked with Dave some of those companies make hundreds of millions if not billions of dollars in profit billions of dollars in profit and so you could say here's a well that's what's driving them just to want to make money but we do walk around there and and learn those lessons we have an online training course because we we want to get this information to as many people as possible how do you do that how do you scale that I can't be everywhere Dave can't be anywhere everywhere life babbin can't be everywhere jpg can't be everywhere we can't just be everywhere so what we did is we consolidated information onto the extreme ownership academy it's leadership courses we do live sessions on there all the time if you have a question you come there and ask me go to extreme ownership dot com for that if you want to help service members active and retired their families gold star families check out mark least mom momily she's got a charity organization that does all kinds of great stuff for military members and our veterans if you want to donate or you want to get involved go to america's mighty warriors dot org and if you want more of my prolonged proclamations we need more of echoes derelict decrees you can find us on the in a website on twitter on the gram on facebook echoes at accoutrails i am at jockel one like where you had david david our book david our book i escaped the uh the ridicule the ridicule it's nice what ridicule you know what derelict decrees if you if all right if you're not getting ridiculed it means people don't like you and many thanks to all the men and women in the army navy air force marines you are the ones that carry out the will of our country and you are also the ones who pay the price and we are forever indicted to you for your sacrifice and to police law enforcement firefighters paramedics emt's dispatchers correctional officers border patrol secret service and all first responders you step up and you protect us here on the home front and we are indicted to your service as well how do everyone else out there this might seem obvious but think about what you're doing way the risks and the benefits the strategic benefits the reward and the consequences and make sure make sure that you are doing the right things for the right reasons and until next time this is dav and echo and jackel and they'll get these people up there and say thank you and those patients who are only alive because of these companies are grateful to be alive and they are overjoyed that those capitalist doctors were greedy enough to take the risk and invest money and push hard and toil I do the work to create products that actually saved people's lives and the same thing the same thing can be said for war the same thing can be said for war and I have participated in wars that made some defense companies tons of money you know I said I said this Russell brand something along the lines of like listen I could be talking to my platoon and say all right guys here's what's going on tonight we're going to go out we're going to risk our lives and I just wanted to let you know that every round that you fire is going to put 12 cents into the pockets of the wartime profitiers right it's really is it created an error to buy which they're only goal is to somehow whether it's lying there pockets or whatever that might be is we lose side of the fact that most of the mechanics that are going on inside industry these companies we work with are regular people trying to do the right thing even for the most part of my experience at the highest levels we work with CEOs of multi billion dollar companies and what you get to know is that for the most part for the most part they're people trying to do the right thing they try to make money yes because for a whole host of good reasons they want to pay their bills they want to pay their people they want to grow they want to expand they want to build bright products and they're safe they can reach more but all these things and I'm not naive and I don't want people to think the exact opposite of like everybody's just altruistic and for the for the big no that that's not the case but there's a trap that we can fall into which was there's this this thing the industry well if it's just the industry so what do they do they want more there's only one way back to the book there's only one way to disarm any semblance of practicality that is for all nations to get together and scrap every ship every gun every rifle every tank every warplane even this if it were possible would not be enough the next war according to experts will not be fought with battleships not by artillery not with rifles and not with machine guns but it will be fought with deadly chemicals and gases secretly each nation is studying and perfecting newer and ghastly remains of annihilating its foes wholesale yes ships will continue to be built for the ship builders must make their profits and guns will still be manufactured manufactured and powder and rifles will be made for the munitions makers must make their huge profits and the soldiers of course must wear uniforms for the manufacturer must make their war profits too but victory or defeat will be determined by the skill and ingenuity of our scientists if we put them to work making poison gas and more and more finished mechanical and explosive instruments of destruction they will have no time for the constructive job of building greater prosperity for all peoples by putting them to this useful job we can all make more money out of peace then we can out of war even the munitions bakers so I say to hell with war and that's the end of it again you know he's in the end you know kind of got the fantasy got the fantasy argument of hey can't we just have people working on good the have the scientists working on good stuff instead of evil stuff and but I also know what happens on the ground Dave you know what happens on the ground I know I know that we help people the people on the ground I know that we killed evil terrorists and insurgents that systematically tortured and raped and murdered the innocent local populace I know that we did that I know that we were able to protect children from these insurgents from these tears I know we were able to protect families I know that those families wanted these insurgents out of their city and out of their country and so while there were defense companies certainly making money there was a simultaneous good that was taking place then we took lives hey some people want crack some people want some people want vodka straight up mainstream some people want vodka is vodka good is vodka good no kind of hard to make the argument on you know many many levels either way I dig where you're saying but guess what we don't have to worry about that can't stop anymore we are not in a various company we are making the clean the clean energy drink both uh win win upside short term upside long term in many ways too by the way this electrolytes in this one yeah imagine just being saying oh I know where I'm gonna go with this right now where are you going well we were talking earlier about the fact that hey most companies are out there trying to do the right thing you know and guess what we have we have some companies that are out there saying oh you know what if I can cut the cost my product by a little bit add some chemicals to it that are a little bit cheaper give people an addictive thing called sugar and they'll just buy more of it but I'm not sure that's also my own warped that's sort of the jockel bias which is I think everyone's kind of thinks like me which I know is not true there's also a chance that I'm wrong and a bunch of people would say no matter what was happening in the world maybe like no we're not going to war you know what I mean so you got to have somebody with a detached perspective And so you kind of know what you're getting into a little bit, at least softens out a little bit, you know what war is, some idea what to words going to be like, I can't imagine a bigger contrast at being 19 years old age are going to Europe and like, hey, where is that? I know that for sure yeah check uh then we have leadership strategy and tactics field manual they can answer all your questions about leadership the code the evaluation of protocols you got to know you got to have a code you got to evaluate yourself you got to follow some protocols in life there you go we wrote them for you me and Dave Burke discipline to create them field manual way the warrior could want to three and four Mikey in the dragons about face by hack worth I wrote the forward to an extreme ownership and the academy of leadership that I wrote with my brother life babbin echelon front we have a leadership consultancy and what we do is we solve problems through leadership go to echelon front dot com if you want to have us engage with your company your business or your team go to echelon front dot com that's also where you can find out what about the live events that we do we do the master big leadership learning session two days long next one up is in Vegas last Vegas October 28th and 29th we also do field training exercise we run around and detect commissions and utilize the principles of leadership we do EF battlefield tour get his bird primarily we don't make you march there I mean you know it's that's a thing you survey freaking 19 year old kids that are in the Marine Corps and you ask them how many people how many you want to go to war and there's a big percentage that's coming through in the affirmative and that's the coolest part about the common about that tension which is I mean that's actually the tension that you want is I want I actually want Marines that want to go to war but conceptually you know it's because I said that for the first time along like before I even got out of the navy because guys are coming to me and be like it is going on a bad jockel like life coach you know so it kind of like it kind of affects your life even even though the questions not like necessarily just yours if you got questions you want to answer do you want to hear what we talk about on that underground podcast go to jockel on the ground dot com because $8.18 a month that's how you're supporting that whole thing if you can't afford it it's cool we still want you in the game email assistance at jockel underground dot com we have a YouTube channel you can subscribe to that also origin USA has a cool YouTube channel with a shown behind the scenes it's going on psychological warfare is an album that echo made I talked on it and he asked me to be on his podcast and it was pretty it's pretty cool because he started off the podcast he was saying like he's been real complimentary of me and like and and just being nice you know this guy you know he thanked me for my service and and you know he he said I did great bunch of great stuff and and real complimentary little nice yeah that's a cheap thing is decentralized is possible and I know I covered a little bit of of Thomas Sol's book I think I don't know if I even got to it it was I don't think you were on the podcast was with Jordan Peterson but he got this little section where he just talks about how freaking hard it is to like control price you just you can't you can't do it you can't control price has to do with the pelts of some animal and there's a worth a certain amount and you know what there are some really good ones and there are some not so good ones and people in the government I know classmates in mind that are that work in the government and you know what they try to do most of the time every day the right thing they try to do the right thing do they always do the right thing no are their forces it play that make a difficult of course but it's not but not so much that don't understand what it actually what what that really means is send somebody off to war we were just talking an hour ago when these people went to war war one to even know what they were doing they even know what it meant to send someone to war and there's just no way so so eventually you know we get to we start having the conversation and then he posed this kind of two questions and they were somehow paired up or they were somehow there was like a semi colon between them meaning they were attached they weren't quite separate but they were still attached but they were they were a little bit separate so the one of them was like isn't war driven by the profitability of the military industrial complex that was kind of question to one of them one and then similar question isn't capitalism and and businesses and corporations aren't they simply driven by the profitability for the rich owners and shareholders so that was kind of the question aren't these two major forces in the world the military and the corporate world aren't they just driven by greed essentially right what do we got so speaking of being careful I like it we got to be careful with what we put in our bodies especially on this path the path is hard they broke I'm saying it's hard it's not always easy it's fun can be fun from time to time let's you when you're collecting those long-term gains seems to be capability cognitive enhancement smart all that stuff better decision making too either way we're on this path we want to stay healthy stay ahead of the game health wise day by notice you drinking the mango discipline good choice you could drink the orange could have but have a little bit of love hate relationship with the mango stand fully so discipline go that's what this is that's what we're talking about here it's a healthy energy drink it's gonna be beneficial to the people there you know that we're gonna kill some of the people there not just the enemy but some of the people that are there are going to die because of us and we're going to have our own people killed that's what we need to think about we can never lose that tension Is that people are desensitized somewhat, you know, going, going, whatever, YouTube, I don't know, does YouTube feel throughout like heinous shootings and stuff like that?
