00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.32
This is Jocco podcast, number 66.

2
00:00:04.32 --> 00:00:07.88
With echo Charles and me, Jocco Willink.

3
00:00:07.88 --> 00:00:08.88
Good evening, echo.

4
00:00:08.88 --> 00:00:09.72
Good evening.

5
00:00:12.72 --> 00:00:18.28
At 325, the troop once again received orders to attack.

6
00:00:18.28 --> 00:00:20.76
I gave an order full of enthusiasm.

7
00:00:20.76 --> 00:00:25.32
I told the troop we attack in five minutes to the 70 Easting.

8
00:00:25.32 --> 00:00:28.08
This is the movement we have all awaited.

9
00:00:28.08 --> 00:00:32.84
Although we knew the general locations of large enemy units,

10
00:00:32.84 --> 00:00:37.84
we had not received detailed intelligence about the enemy we were to encounter.

11
00:00:37.84 --> 00:00:42.68
I had a feeling, however, that this time we would meet the enemy.

12
00:00:42.68 --> 00:00:48.12
Lieutenant Gautier, known for his deadpan sense of humor, asked on the radio,

13
00:00:48.12 --> 00:00:51.40
what kind of contact can we expect?

14
00:00:51.40 --> 00:00:54.48
I replied, enemy contact.

15
00:00:54.48 --> 00:00:58.04
He said, Roger, that's the best kind.

16
00:00:58.04 --> 00:01:02.80
And the troop rolled forward through the blowing sand.

17
00:01:03.92 --> 00:01:12.60
And that's a little excerpt from a personal account from a guy by the name of HR McMaster.

18
00:01:12.60 --> 00:01:23.08
He may have heard about recently coming into a higher profile job in the current administration.

19
00:01:23.08 --> 00:01:28.04
But he's a very interesting guy, and I wanted to talk a little bit about his experience

20
00:01:28.04 --> 00:01:32.04
and some of the things that he said about, that's the way he sees things.

21
00:01:32.04 --> 00:01:39.24
And so he was in this big battle in the first Gulf War as a captain.

22
00:01:39.24 --> 00:01:44.000
So in charge of a group of 140 guys.

23
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.76
And he fought in this battle called the Battle of 73 Easting.

24
00:01:47.76 --> 00:01:53.000
And I'm going to go a little excerpt from Wikipedia that sort of gives you the broad.

25
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.52
I do what was going on.

26
00:01:54.52 --> 00:01:59.76
The Battle of 73 Easting refers narrowly to the violent armored combat action that took place

27
00:01:59.76 --> 00:02:06.52
in the final hours of second ACR's covering force operation in the zone of second squadron

28
00:02:06.52 --> 00:02:10.92
and in the northern third of the third squadron zone.

29
00:02:10.92 --> 00:02:19.16
In the battle, four of second ACR's armored cavalry troops, troops E, G, and I with

30
00:02:19.16 --> 00:02:27.20
troop K contributing to I troops fight, totaling about 36 M1A1 tanks defeated two enemy

31
00:02:27.20 --> 00:02:32.40
brigades, the 18th brigade, and later in the day the 9th armored brigade.

32
00:02:32.40 --> 00:02:37.08
So it's interesting, you have a legitimate tank battle, right?

33
00:02:37.08 --> 00:02:40.64
Like a World War II style tank battle that took place in the first Gulf War.

34
00:02:40.64 --> 00:02:42.56
And that's what this is talking about.

35
00:02:42.56 --> 00:02:49.36
And McMaster at the time McMaster was in charge of Eagle Troop.

36
00:02:49.36 --> 00:02:51.84
So they got some good details in here.

37
00:02:51.84 --> 00:02:53.68
Again, this is very simple.

38
00:02:53.68 --> 00:02:57.92
One of the best clearest descriptions of what happened.

39
00:02:57.92 --> 00:02:59.60
It was actually on Wikipedia.

40
00:02:59.60 --> 00:03:02.28
So I just pulled some of that.

41
00:03:02.28 --> 00:03:06.88
So here we go, a little bit of what Eagle Troop did.

42
00:03:06.88 --> 00:03:12.40
But four 10 PM Eagle Troop received fire from an Iraqi infantry position in a cluster of

43
00:03:12.40 --> 00:03:13.92
buildings.

44
00:03:13.92 --> 00:03:17.40
Eagle Troop Abrams and Bradleys returned fire.

45
00:03:17.40 --> 00:03:24.000
Silence the Iraqi guns took prisoners and continued east with the two tank platoons leading.

46
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:31.12
The 9 M1A1 tanks of Eagle Troop destroyed 28 Iraqi tanks, 16 personnel carriers, and

47
00:03:31.12 --> 00:03:37.80
30 trucks in 23 minutes with no American losses.

48
00:03:37.80 --> 00:03:45.84
So you got 9 tanks against 28 tanks and 16 personnel carriers and 30 trucks.

49
00:03:45.84 --> 00:03:48.04
And the 9 tanks win.

50
00:03:48.04 --> 00:03:51.20
That's this domination battlefield domination.

51
00:03:51.20 --> 00:03:55.04
And there's a bunch of technical reasons as well as leadership reasons that we're going

52
00:03:55.04 --> 00:03:57.48
to get into.

53
00:03:57.48 --> 00:04:04.08
Next, at about 420 Eagle Crested a low rise and surprised an Iraqi tank company set up in

54
00:04:04.08 --> 00:04:07.88
a reverse slope defense on the 70 East.

55
00:04:07.88 --> 00:04:12.56
Captain McMaster leading the attack immediately engaged that position destroying the

56
00:04:12.56 --> 00:04:15.68
first of the eight enemy tanks to his front.

57
00:04:15.68 --> 00:04:18.76
His two tank platoons finished the rest.

58
00:04:18.76 --> 00:04:25.64
So they're just hammering hammering these Iraqi tanks.

59
00:04:25.64 --> 00:04:31.80
Three kilometers to the east McMaster could see T72s those are the tanks that the Iraqis

60
00:04:31.80 --> 00:04:34.000
are using in prepared positions.

61
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
Continually his attack passed the limit.

62
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.48
The 70 limit of advance.

63
00:04:37.48 --> 00:04:42.52
So the way maps are set up, there's there's coordinates on them and each one of the

64
00:04:42.52 --> 00:04:43.52
coordinates.

65
00:04:43.52 --> 00:04:50.44
Each one of the lines that runs north south has a has a label to it 69 70 71 72 73.

66
00:04:50.44 --> 00:04:53.64
So he had been told not to go past the 70 East thing.

67
00:04:53.64 --> 00:04:54.64
That's what they're saying.

68
00:04:54.64 --> 00:04:57.32
Because his limit of advance, these are all really common military terms.

69
00:04:57.32 --> 00:05:01.88
They say, hey, you're not allowed to go past this road or this coordinate on a map and they

70
00:05:01.88 --> 00:05:04.32
just call that a limit of advance.

71
00:05:04.32 --> 00:05:06.72
So he was supposed to stop at 70.

72
00:05:06.72 --> 00:05:09.08
He asked to get after a little bit of the other.

73
00:05:09.08 --> 00:05:12.88
Continuing his attack passed the 70 limit of advance, he fought his way through an infantry

74
00:05:12.88 --> 00:05:18.08
defense position and on the high ground along the 74 East.

75
00:05:18.08 --> 00:05:23.12
And this is going now that I mixed this in here with the Wikipedia, which was a very simple

76
00:05:23.12 --> 00:05:25.000
explanation of what happened.

77
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:32.36
Now going into a personal account that McMaster wrote himself when he was a young captain.

78
00:05:32.36 --> 00:05:34.64
So here we go from Captain McMaster's account.

79
00:05:34.64 --> 00:05:38.60
Lieutenant Gifford called me from the command post to remind me that the 70 East was the

80
00:05:38.60 --> 00:05:40.76
limit of advance.

81
00:05:40.76 --> 00:05:42.32
We were already beyond it.

82
00:05:42.32 --> 00:05:44.24
I told him I can't stop.

83
00:05:44.24 --> 00:05:45.80
We're still in contact.

84
00:05:45.80 --> 00:05:47.44
Tell them I'm sorry.

85
00:05:47.44 --> 00:05:51.04
Gifford explained the situation to the squadron headquarters on the radio.

86
00:05:51.04 --> 00:05:55.92
Major McGregor was forward with our tanks and fully understood the situation.

87
00:05:55.92 --> 00:06:00.68
If we had stopped, we would have forfeited the shock effect we had inflicted on the enemy.

88
00:06:00.68 --> 00:06:05.000
Had we halted, we would have given the enemy further to the east and opportunities

89
00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.20
to organize an effort against us while we presented them with stationary targets.

90
00:06:10.20 --> 00:06:14.16
We had the advantage and had to finish the battle rapidly.

91
00:06:14.16 --> 00:06:20.76
We would press the attack until all of the enemy were destroyed or until they surrendered.

92
00:06:20.76 --> 00:06:23.36
That's a pretty bold move to just push.

93
00:06:23.36 --> 00:06:24.36
It's also a risky move.

94
00:06:24.36 --> 00:06:28.24
I'll say the biggest risk of it is having a blue on blue situation unfold.

95
00:06:28.24 --> 00:06:34.12
I think it makes a lot easier in the fact that this was daytime and that just makes it

96
00:06:34.12 --> 00:06:37.32
everything so much more clear in the daytime.

97
00:06:37.32 --> 00:06:39.32
You could obviously make some mistakes.

98
00:06:39.32 --> 00:06:42.36
If you're pushing that limited advance is there for a reason and you might have some

99
00:06:42.36 --> 00:06:44.24
other group that's controlling that sector.

100
00:06:44.24 --> 00:06:48.04
You also might have air power that the air power might be told, hey, if you see any

101
00:06:48.04 --> 00:06:50.68
vehicles moving past 70 Easting, you can

102
00:06:50.68 --> 00:06:52.84
start dropping bombs.

103
00:06:52.84 --> 00:06:56.80
You do have to be very cautious when you make an aggressive move like this.

104
00:06:56.80 --> 00:07:00.24
I bet McMaster himself would go back and say, you know what I should have done as I

105
00:07:00.24 --> 00:07:01.24
should have given him a heads up.

106
00:07:01.24 --> 00:07:02.64
I'm pushing past 70 Easting.

107
00:07:02.64 --> 00:07:05.88
Please let everybody know.

108
00:07:05.88 --> 00:07:08.88
This is going back to the wiki account here.

109
00:07:08.88 --> 00:07:14.28
There he encountered a destroyed another tank unit of 18 T72s.

110
00:07:14.28 --> 00:07:17.60
In that accident, the Iraqis stood their ground and attempted to maneuver against the

111
00:07:17.60 --> 00:07:18.60
troop.

112
00:07:18.60 --> 00:07:24.24
This was the first determined defense the regiment had encountered in three days of operations.

113
00:07:24.24 --> 00:07:28.92
Still, the Iraqi troop had been surprised because of the inclement weather and were quickly

114
00:07:28.92 --> 00:07:34.36
destroyed by the better trained and better equipped American troops.

115
00:07:34.36 --> 00:07:39.12
After defeating that force, McMaster sent a scout platoon of two Bradley's North to regain

116
00:07:39.12 --> 00:07:44.60
contact with troop G. In doing that, the scout platoon encountered another Iraqi tank

117
00:07:44.60 --> 00:07:51.36
position of 13 T72s which they destroyed with tow missiles.

118
00:07:51.36 --> 00:07:57.16
So as these guys are just everywhere, they find these Iraqi tanks, they're just crushing

119
00:07:57.16 --> 00:07:58.16
them.

120
00:07:58.16 --> 00:08:01.64
This is going back to McMaster's account again.

121
00:08:01.64 --> 00:08:06.60
I jumped on top of my tank to give the crew room to cross load ammunition while I monitored

122
00:08:06.60 --> 00:08:07.96
the radio.

123
00:08:07.96 --> 00:08:12.08
I surveyed the fires which surrounded the troop.

124
00:08:12.08 --> 00:08:15.68
It seemed as if the action had only lasted seconds.

125
00:08:15.68 --> 00:08:19.04
I felt no significant emotion during the battle.

126
00:08:19.04 --> 00:08:22.12
I think I had simply been too busy.

127
00:08:22.12 --> 00:08:24.36
I realized that I had not eaten all day.

128
00:08:24.36 --> 00:08:31.64
I torn to an MRE, package, and devoured a dinner of cold potatoes and ham.

129
00:08:31.64 --> 00:08:38.16
I gulp down some water and the quick infusion seemed to slow the flow of adrenaline.

130
00:08:38.16 --> 00:08:39.64
So I thought that was interesting.

131
00:08:39.64 --> 00:08:45.24
He was just doing his job. He wasn't getting emotional and just getting it done.

132
00:08:45.24 --> 00:08:49.56
Then the ceasefire comes the next day and that's it.

133
00:08:49.56 --> 00:08:50.84
The war's over.

134
00:08:50.84 --> 00:08:55.12
I mean this was the war was 72 hours and the war's over.

135
00:08:55.12 --> 00:09:01.32
He kind of talks about what are you thinking here once they hear the ceasefire.

136
00:09:01.32 --> 00:09:02.92
Back to McMaster's account.

137
00:09:02.92 --> 00:09:05.32
Eagle troop had taken no casualties.

138
00:09:05.32 --> 00:09:09.12
I and other soldiers offered prayers of thanks to God.

139
00:09:09.12 --> 00:09:11.60
We did not glow over our victory.

140
00:09:11.60 --> 00:09:16.80
We had simply done our part in liberating Kuwait from the treachery and inhumanity of Saddam

141
00:09:16.80 --> 00:09:20.96
Hussein and his Republican guard, Henshman.

142
00:09:20.96 --> 00:09:24.52
We surprised the enemy on the 26th February.

143
00:09:24.52 --> 00:09:28.84
That surprise and the bold action and teamwork of the troop soldiers contributed to the

144
00:09:28.84 --> 00:09:33.64
route that is now known as the Battle of 73 East.

145
00:09:33.64 --> 00:09:38.52
In general, the Iraqis were unprepared for the United States Army.

146
00:09:38.52 --> 00:09:41.20
Americans are better trained and equipped.

147
00:09:41.20 --> 00:09:46.48
The true decisive factor, however, was the American soldier.

148
00:09:46.48 --> 00:09:52.48
He is the best at what he does and absolutely dedicated to serving his country.

149
00:09:52.48 --> 00:09:57.92
Our soldiers were aggressive and battle yet demonstrated great discipline and compassion for

150
00:09:57.92 --> 00:09:58.92
their enemy.

151
00:09:58.92 --> 00:10:04.84
I am grateful that I had the opportunity to serve with them in this action.

152
00:10:04.84 --> 00:10:12.28
Captain H. R. McMaster, E. Troop, two, two, A. C. R.

153
00:10:12.28 --> 00:10:17.24
So in and I didn't go into it too much of I didn't go into it at all but they took a lot

154
00:10:17.24 --> 00:10:18.24
of prisoners as well.

155
00:10:18.24 --> 00:10:19.24
They weren't just killing everyone.

156
00:10:19.24 --> 00:10:21.80
There was a lot of people that were surrounding a lot of Iraqi soldiers that were

157
00:10:21.80 --> 00:10:24.96
surrendering and they were doing their best to take care of those guys.

158
00:10:24.96 --> 00:10:29.20
And there are also some that pretended to surrender and then attacked.

159
00:10:29.20 --> 00:10:34.80
So they had a little bit of both and they as McMaster said, they showed great discipline

160
00:10:34.80 --> 00:10:36.36
and compassion for the enemy.

161
00:10:36.36 --> 00:10:43.40
Now, you can go online and you can read the full account of what this whole battle felt

162
00:10:43.40 --> 00:10:44.40
like.

163
00:10:44.40 --> 00:10:52.12
But he recently wrote, so now he's at the U.S. a captain at the time, 103 and now he's

164
00:10:52.12 --> 00:11:00.76
a lieutenant general with three star and there's a website called the strategy bridge.org.

165
00:11:00.76 --> 00:11:05.20
And there's an article there which is written by McMaster.

166
00:11:05.20 --> 00:11:10.80
And he goes through the lessons that he learned in that battle.

167
00:11:10.80 --> 00:11:18.64
And the article is called, something along the lines of, hey, guidance for small unit

168
00:11:18.64 --> 00:11:20.28
leaders.

169
00:11:20.28 --> 00:11:27.40
So I thought there were some, some good solid lessons learned that he brought back.

170
00:11:27.40 --> 00:11:29.52
Some of them go through them.

171
00:11:29.52 --> 00:11:33.96
Number one, lead from the front.

172
00:11:33.96 --> 00:11:38.36
Leaders must be forward to gain a clear picture and make decisions.

173
00:11:38.36 --> 00:11:43.80
As Sergeant Harris engaged with 25 millimeter, Lieutenant Gautier moved forward to assess

174
00:11:43.80 --> 00:11:46.20
and further develop the situation.

175
00:11:46.20 --> 00:11:51.000
So to explain that, you've got a sergeant that's like engaging the enemy and then

176
00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.04
Lieutenant, he doesn't just sit there.

177
00:11:53.04 --> 00:11:56.56
He goes forward to find out what's going on and assess what's happening.

178
00:11:56.56 --> 00:12:01.000
So as a leader, when your troops are getting busy doing the work, what can you do?

179
00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.72
Don't get disdon't get targeted, fixated on your own guys in the work that they're doing.

180
00:12:04.72 --> 00:12:11.40
Look around, go forward, move to a different position where you can see more.

181
00:12:11.40 --> 00:12:16.60
To the book, Gautier fired a tone missile into the center of the enemy position in the

182
00:12:16.60 --> 00:12:19.08
village to orient our tanks.

183
00:12:19.08 --> 00:12:24.80
After our gunner, Staff Sergeant Craig Koch fired a subsequent tank round to mark center,

184
00:12:24.80 --> 00:12:28.84
all nine tanks fired high explosive rounds into the village simultaneously to suppress

185
00:12:28.84 --> 00:12:30.60
the enemy position.

186
00:12:30.60 --> 00:12:35.64
Despite the secondary explosions in the village to itself, first platoon maintained its primary

187
00:12:35.64 --> 00:12:37.76
observation to the east.

188
00:12:37.76 --> 00:12:44.80
So he's basically marking their position, Lieutenant Gautier basically marks the position.

189
00:12:44.80 --> 00:12:50.24
So not only did he move and observe what was happening, then he's directing everyone

190
00:12:50.24 --> 00:12:52.08
else once he does that.

191
00:12:52.08 --> 00:12:55.92
So it's a really simple combat you hear it all the time, lead from the front.

192
00:12:55.92 --> 00:12:57.64
Now can you get too far forward?

193
00:12:57.64 --> 00:13:00.80
Yes, you absolutely can.

194
00:13:00.80 --> 00:13:05.000
If you're the guy that's actually engaging the enemy and you're having to either

195
00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:10.000
with your weapon in a tank or your weapon, your personal weapon on your rifle and you're

196
00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.84
the leader and you're actually shooting bad guys well, then you got some issues because

197
00:13:13.84 --> 00:13:14.84
you need to be looking around.

198
00:13:14.84 --> 00:13:16.88
You need to be seeing what the next move is going to be.

199
00:13:16.88 --> 00:13:20.52
So lead from the front, but always the dichotomy is there don't go so far forward that

200
00:13:20.52 --> 00:13:26.28
you lose the ability to look around and observe what's happening.

201
00:13:26.28 --> 00:13:31.28
Number two, shoot first.

202
00:13:31.28 --> 00:13:35.52
If you know where friendly forces are and there is not a danger of civilian casualties,

203
00:13:35.52 --> 00:13:39.52
do not hesitate to shoot or conduct reconnaissance by fire.

204
00:13:39.52 --> 00:13:43.16
The side that shoots first has a tremendous advantage.

205
00:13:43.16 --> 00:13:48.40
Staff Sergeant David Lawrence was the commander of First Platoon's Northernmost Bradley.

206
00:13:48.40 --> 00:13:53.84
When his gunner, Sergeant Bradley Feldman said, hey, I've got a hot spot out there.

207
00:13:53.84 --> 00:13:55.72
I'm not sure what it is.

208
00:13:55.72 --> 00:13:58.08
Lawrence responded, put a toe in it.

209
00:13:58.08 --> 00:13:59.72
See what it is.

210
00:13:59.72 --> 00:14:02.000
The toe is a toe missile.

211
00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:07.32
Lawrence identified the hot spot as a T72 as the turret was ripped from its hull in the

212
00:14:07.32 --> 00:14:09.32
ensuing explosion.

213
00:14:09.32 --> 00:14:14.08
Our troops experience was consistent with Erwin Rommel's observation in his World War

214
00:14:14.08 --> 00:14:15.80
One book Infantry Attacks.

215
00:14:15.80 --> 00:14:17.32
And this is a Rommel talking.

216
00:14:17.32 --> 00:14:22.72
I have found again and again in encounter actions, in encounter actions, the day goes to

217
00:14:22.72 --> 00:14:28.16
the side that is first to plaster its opponents with fire.

218
00:14:28.16 --> 00:14:30.16
And I think that's the first route first.

219
00:14:30.16 --> 00:14:33.16
And out of that, real simple, be aggressive.

220
00:14:33.16 --> 00:14:40.16
Now he points out very clearly here, you know, where there's where you know where friendly

221
00:14:40.16 --> 00:14:42.16
forces are, right?

222
00:14:42.16 --> 00:14:46.16
You know where friendly forces are because obviously that can go sideways.

223
00:14:46.16 --> 00:14:51.16
And by the way, when he pushed past his limit of advance, now also no one knew or

224
00:14:51.16 --> 00:14:52.16
he was.

225
00:14:52.16 --> 00:14:54.16
So he need to be careful in that situation.

226
00:14:54.16 --> 00:15:00.16
That aggressive being aggressive with fire is something you have to do.

227
00:15:00.16 --> 00:15:04.16
And you can see, like they saw hot spot out there on their thermal, I don't know what this

228
00:15:04.16 --> 00:15:05.16
is.

229
00:15:05.16 --> 00:15:06.16
Yeah, put it on it.

230
00:15:06.16 --> 00:15:08.16
We know it's not good guys.

231
00:15:08.16 --> 00:15:09.16
Okay.

232
00:15:09.16 --> 00:15:10.16
Blast it.

233
00:15:10.16 --> 00:15:16.16
We had a, I've been in Baghdad on my first deployment for like a couple days.

234
00:15:16.16 --> 00:15:21.16
And we went out on an operation.

235
00:15:21.16 --> 00:15:24.16
And anyways, when we were coming back, we got ambushed and wasn't a big deal.

236
00:15:24.16 --> 00:15:28.16
But like, we, you know, we received fire and so we returned fire.

237
00:15:28.16 --> 00:15:34.16
And basically we returned fire heavily and, and we were getting after it.

238
00:15:34.16 --> 00:15:35.16
Yeah.

239
00:15:35.16 --> 00:15:38.16
This is when we didn't have any armor on our home, these.

240
00:15:38.16 --> 00:15:40.16
They were just, there's open.

241
00:15:40.16 --> 00:15:41.16
They didn't have doors.

242
00:15:41.16 --> 00:15:43.16
So we didn't have armor on these.

243
00:15:43.16 --> 00:15:46.16
Not many people didn't in a racket that time in 2003.

244
00:15:46.16 --> 00:15:50.16
So what we had done is we had taken the doors completely off.

245
00:15:50.16 --> 00:15:54.16
And then we'd taken our seats and turned them so they faced outwards.

246
00:15:54.16 --> 00:16:00.16
So we, and we, we'd have our feet like hanging out of the home view or maybe sitting on these,

247
00:16:00.16 --> 00:16:02.16
these big rails that we built along the side.

248
00:16:02.16 --> 00:16:04.16
And so we'd be facing out.

249
00:16:04.16 --> 00:16:07.16
It was, you were in a, you were basically in a position to shoot it all times.

250
00:16:07.16 --> 00:16:11.16
And because the way a home view set up with doors on either side and then people in the back,

251
00:16:11.16 --> 00:16:19.16
you had 360 degrees of, of visibility and of, feels a fire coming out of,

252
00:16:19.16 --> 00:16:20.16
every Humvee.

253
00:16:20.16 --> 00:16:25.16
And so when we got, we were driving, we were all not, we had just done a little operation,

254
00:16:25.16 --> 00:16:26.16
we were coming back.

255
00:16:26.16 --> 00:16:28.16
And as we were coming back, we started taking fire.

256
00:16:28.16 --> 00:16:29.16
And so we just returned fire.

257
00:16:29.16 --> 00:16:31.16
It was a massive return of fire.

258
00:16:31.16 --> 00:16:36.16
Like I think the enemy was pre-overwhelmed with it.

259
00:16:36.16 --> 00:16:38.16
And we got back.

260
00:16:38.16 --> 00:16:41.16
And everyone was kind of like, well, we kind of, we kind of laid it down.

261
00:16:41.16 --> 00:16:44.16
We went through a lot of rounds in a very short period of time.

262
00:16:44.16 --> 00:16:48.16
And the reason I'm saying this story is because that was my platoon.

263
00:16:48.16 --> 00:16:51.16
And so we get back and, and we're kind of debriefing.

264
00:16:51.16 --> 00:16:56.16
And then the next day, we're going out of another operation.

265
00:16:56.16 --> 00:17:00.16
And I don't know if this story is going to make any sense, but the next day we're going

266
00:17:00.16 --> 00:17:01.16
out of another operation.

267
00:17:01.16 --> 00:17:06.16
And one of my bros, who wasn't, who is my senior and listed advisor at the time.

268
00:17:06.16 --> 00:17:09.16
But he wasn't on that mission that we just did.

269
00:17:09.16 --> 00:17:13.16
And he's, he goes, listen, if you guys take contact, you need to shoot back.

270
00:17:13.16 --> 00:17:15.16
You can't be afraid to fire.

271
00:17:15.16 --> 00:17:18.16
And I made some combat. Like, don't worry. We'll be good to get hold of one.

272
00:17:18.16 --> 00:17:20.16
And here's the phrase, this year.

273
00:17:20.16 --> 00:17:23.16
And then everyone laughed because they knew that we put down a lot of lead.

274
00:17:23.16 --> 00:17:26.16
If you want to trade bullets with us, we'll play that game.

275
00:17:26.16 --> 00:17:28.16
We don't mind trading some bullets.

276
00:17:28.16 --> 00:17:31.16
So the same thing though.

277
00:17:31.16 --> 00:17:33.16
If you start feeling like you're going to get contacted.

278
00:17:33.16 --> 00:17:37.16
And then that's another thing is to just, you know, when you're in a firefight,

279
00:17:37.16 --> 00:17:39.16
where do you think the enemy might be?

280
00:17:39.16 --> 00:17:42.16
And we heard this a lot. The Korean Marines were talking about the Marines,

281
00:17:42.16 --> 00:17:45.16
the Marines, the US Marines that were in Korea. We're talking about that.

282
00:17:45.16 --> 00:17:48.16
Hey, you're going to put fire down where we think the enemy might be.

283
00:17:48.16 --> 00:17:51.16
Because that's where, you know, you're looking at an area.

284
00:17:51.16 --> 00:17:53.16
And there's a good covered position.

285
00:17:53.16 --> 00:17:56.16
There's a bad guy. It's probably going to be there. Put fire on him.

286
00:17:56.16 --> 00:18:01.16
Shoot first. Lesson number two from General McMaster.

287
00:18:01.16 --> 00:18:03.16
All right. Number three.

288
00:18:03.16 --> 00:18:07.16
Fight through the fog of battle.

289
00:18:07.16 --> 00:18:11.16
Be prepared for confusion and concurrent activity.

290
00:18:11.16 --> 00:18:14.16
As we suppressed enemy positions in the village,

291
00:18:14.16 --> 00:18:16.16
while Lawrence was launching a missile,

292
00:18:16.16 --> 00:18:20.16
the troop received permission to advance to the 70 East.

293
00:18:20.16 --> 00:18:24.16
I instructed First Platoon to resume movement to the East.

294
00:18:24.16 --> 00:18:30.16
Lieutenant Peshchek did not respond immediately because Lawrence was reporting on the Platoon radio net.

295
00:18:30.16 --> 00:18:34.16
Contact, contact, east, tank.

296
00:18:34.16 --> 00:18:40.16
Simple orders and complete reports are essential to maintaining common understanding

297
00:18:40.16 --> 00:18:43.16
in battle.

298
00:18:43.16 --> 00:18:47.16
So there's another example of got to keep things simple.

299
00:18:47.16 --> 00:18:54.16
And he's specifically talking about how you communicate with other people on the radio.

300
00:18:54.16 --> 00:19:01.16
That's what he's talking about. You have to communicate simply and clearly in order for people to understand what's happening.

301
00:19:01.16 --> 00:19:06.16
That can mean if you give a lot of times you see this people trying to give too much detail.

302
00:19:06.16 --> 00:19:11.16
Right. Listen to this contact, contact, east, tank.

303
00:19:11.16 --> 00:19:15.16
That's it. Where's the contact? It's to the east. What is it? It's a tank.

304
00:19:15.16 --> 00:19:18.16
That's it. That's what we need to know. Now everybody knows it's going on.

305
00:19:18.16 --> 00:19:21.16
If you said, hey, I've got a contact. He's about 480 meters.

306
00:19:21.16 --> 00:19:26.16
It is a T72 tank. It's moving in an eastward. No, we don't care about any of that right now.

307
00:19:26.16 --> 00:19:30.16
Do we don't care about any of that? Just tell us what is happening.

308
00:19:30.16 --> 00:19:34.16
And that's one of the things that can help you fight through the fog of battle.

309
00:19:34.16 --> 00:19:38.16
That contact call is actually a standard operating procedure.

310
00:19:38.16 --> 00:19:42.16
I'm assuming, which is because we would do this in the seal teams.

311
00:19:42.16 --> 00:19:47.16
You'd give what type of contact it is, what direction or sorry, what bearing and what distance.

312
00:19:47.16 --> 00:19:52.16
So you'd say machine gun fire 150 meters for a clock.

313
00:19:52.16 --> 00:19:56.16
And now everybody gets a very quick read of what's happening because you can't,

314
00:19:56.16 --> 00:19:58.16
not everyone's going to see where the firing came from.

315
00:19:58.16 --> 00:20:03.16
So even having a standard operating procedure to keep your, your verbiage limited is important.

316
00:20:03.16 --> 00:20:12.16
There's calls, but all, everything we do in the seal teams basically has a very simple call that you can make.

317
00:20:12.16 --> 00:20:17.16
And it's broken down into like three words contact front online.

318
00:20:17.16 --> 00:20:20.16
You know, that's it. Everyone knows what to do.

319
00:20:20.16 --> 00:20:24.16
Every seal you tell them contact front online, they know what to do.

320
00:20:24.16 --> 00:20:29.16
Number four.

321
00:20:29.16 --> 00:20:32.16
Follow your instincts and intuition.

322
00:20:32.16 --> 00:20:43.16
As Sergeant Feldman launched the tow missile, I decided to go to a tank's lead formation and instructed green and white the tank platoons to follow my move.

323
00:20:43.16 --> 00:20:49.16
First platoon pulled in behind as the tank wedge moved forward and covered the tanks rear.

324
00:20:49.16 --> 00:20:52.16
Third platoon retained responsibility for flank security.

325
00:20:52.16 --> 00:20:55.16
Got to maintain that flank security.

326
00:20:55.16 --> 00:21:01.16
As we began moving forward, first platoon responding to the contact report on their platoon radio net,

327
00:21:01.16 --> 00:21:05.16
began firing 25 millimeter high explosive munitions across the front.

328
00:21:05.16 --> 00:21:09.16
It was a little unnerving for the tanks as we moved forward.

329
00:21:09.16 --> 00:21:12.16
I gave first platoon a ceasefire order.

330
00:21:12.16 --> 00:21:15.16
Red one, this is black sex ceasefire.

331
00:21:15.16 --> 00:21:18.16
The two tank platoons were slightly delayed.

332
00:21:18.16 --> 00:21:23.16
As our tank came over the crest of the imperceptible rise north of the village,

333
00:21:23.16 --> 00:21:28.16
Sergeant Craig Koch, the gunner reported tanks direct front.

334
00:21:28.16 --> 00:21:32.16
I counted 80, 70, 2s in prepared positions.

335
00:21:32.16 --> 00:21:37.16
They were at close range and visible to the naked eye.

336
00:21:37.16 --> 00:21:42.16
So he's talking about trusting your instincts and trusting your intuition and my,

337
00:21:42.16 --> 00:21:44.16
and that's what he's doing here.

338
00:21:44.16 --> 00:21:45.16
He's seeing things happening.

339
00:21:45.16 --> 00:21:46.16
He's seeing things unfold.

340
00:21:46.16 --> 00:21:49.16
He says, hey, go on to this formation boom.

341
00:21:49.16 --> 00:21:50.16
Everyone goes in this formation.

342
00:21:50.16 --> 00:21:51.16
He's acting off of instinct.

343
00:21:51.16 --> 00:21:55.16
But what's important here is where do you're instinct and where is your intuition come from?

344
00:21:55.16 --> 00:21:57.16
It comes from training and experience.

345
00:21:57.16 --> 00:21:59.16
That's where it comes from.

346
00:21:59.16 --> 00:22:01.16
Now, it could be hard to get combat experience.

347
00:22:01.16 --> 00:22:06.16
We hadn't had a tank battle in, well, since World War II.

348
00:22:06.16 --> 00:22:08.16
There's been no major tank battles in here.

349
00:22:08.16 --> 00:22:11.16
These guys are, no, none of these people ever been in a tank battle before.

350
00:22:11.16 --> 00:22:12.16
And now they're in a tank battle.

351
00:22:12.16 --> 00:22:13.16
So how do you do that?

352
00:22:13.16 --> 00:22:15.16
You've got to do realistic simulated training.

353
00:22:15.16 --> 00:22:16.16
That's what you have to do.

354
00:22:16.16 --> 00:22:18.16
And you have to make this realistic.

355
00:22:18.16 --> 00:22:19.16
It's got to be surprising.

356
00:22:19.16 --> 00:22:20.16
It's all the things I talk about all the time.

357
00:22:20.16 --> 00:22:21.16
It's got to be surprising.

358
00:22:21.16 --> 00:22:22.16
It's got to be unknowns.

359
00:22:22.16 --> 00:22:24.16
You've got to do things that people aren't expecting.

360
00:22:24.16 --> 00:22:25.16
That's what you have to do.

361
00:22:25.16 --> 00:22:28.16
So that they can develop their instincts.

362
00:22:28.16 --> 00:22:30.16
So they can develop their intuition.

363
00:22:30.16 --> 00:22:33.16
Because if you're inexperienced and you don't know what you're doing,

364
00:22:33.16 --> 00:22:35.16
and you just decide you're going to follow your instinct,

365
00:22:35.16 --> 00:22:37.16
your instinct can be wrong.

366
00:22:37.16 --> 00:22:38.16
It can be wrong.

367
00:22:38.16 --> 00:22:40.16
And the lead, it's like, you did too.

368
00:22:40.16 --> 00:22:41.16
Right?

369
00:22:41.16 --> 00:22:43.16
You take a new person in GJ2.

370
00:22:43.16 --> 00:22:45.16
Their instincts are going to be wrong.

371
00:22:45.16 --> 00:22:45.16
Period.

372
00:22:45.16 --> 00:22:46.16
You tend to story.

373
00:22:46.16 --> 00:22:46.16
Right?

374
00:22:46.16 --> 00:22:48.16
I mean, the classic is someone is mounted on you.

375
00:22:48.16 --> 00:22:50.16
Then they do one or two things.

376
00:22:50.16 --> 00:22:52.16
You try and push them off of you.

377
00:22:52.16 --> 00:22:53.16
You're getting on a block.

378
00:22:53.16 --> 00:22:55.16
Or you turn around.

379
00:22:55.16 --> 00:22:57.16
You turn over and they're choking you.

380
00:22:57.16 --> 00:22:59.16
But each one of your instincts is wrong.

381
00:22:59.16 --> 00:23:03.16
Your instinct needs to be elbow escape or, you know,

382
00:23:03.16 --> 00:23:04.16
um, bus escape.

383
00:23:04.16 --> 00:23:06.16
Got to be one of those two things.

384
00:23:06.16 --> 00:23:08.16
But those instincts only come from training.

385
00:23:08.16 --> 00:23:10.16
It's the same thing with these combat scenarios.

386
00:23:10.16 --> 00:23:11.16
How you can't just try.

387
00:23:11.16 --> 00:23:13.16
Don't just trust your instinct, doesn't matter.

388
00:23:13.16 --> 00:23:14.16
Yeah.

389
00:23:14.16 --> 00:23:16.16
Make sure you've trained yourself.

390
00:23:16.16 --> 00:23:19.16
Make sure you've prepared yourself.

391
00:23:19.16 --> 00:23:22.16
And then make sure that you did touch.

392
00:23:22.16 --> 00:23:25.16
Because that's another thing that can screw up your instincts.

393
00:23:25.16 --> 00:23:28.16
Is your instincts, your feeling pain, you know,

394
00:23:28.16 --> 00:23:30.16
I was rolling the Andy yesterday.

395
00:23:30.16 --> 00:23:33.16
He will put like pain on me.

396
00:23:33.16 --> 00:23:35.16
He'll put his elbow in my ear or something.

397
00:23:35.16 --> 00:23:39.16
And all he's trying to do is get me to make the instinctual move.

398
00:23:39.16 --> 00:23:40.16
Yeah.

399
00:23:40.16 --> 00:23:42.16
Of, I'm going to greet you up and pull his hand away.

400
00:23:42.16 --> 00:23:44.16
If I do that, I'm getting arm locked.

401
00:23:44.16 --> 00:23:45.16
Right?

402
00:23:45.16 --> 00:23:46.16
You can't do that.

403
00:23:46.16 --> 00:23:47.16
Have to just accept the pain.

404
00:23:47.16 --> 00:23:48.16
Just, just deal with it.

405
00:23:48.16 --> 00:23:49.16
Go.

406
00:23:49.16 --> 00:23:50.16
Grind harder.

407
00:23:50.16 --> 00:23:51.16
And he bring it.

408
00:23:51.16 --> 00:23:52.16
Here.

409
00:23:52.16 --> 00:23:55.16
Your instinct if you start taking fire from a certain position,

410
00:23:55.16 --> 00:23:58.16
that could, your instinct could be, oh, we're going to get down and move over here.

411
00:23:58.16 --> 00:23:59.16
You got to remember.

412
00:23:59.16 --> 00:24:02.16
You got to detach enough that you say, oh,

413
00:24:02.16 --> 00:24:04.16
I need to check my flank.

414
00:24:04.16 --> 00:24:05.16
I need to see what else is going on here.

415
00:24:05.16 --> 00:24:08.16
I need to assess these other situations that might be unfolding.

416
00:24:08.16 --> 00:24:09.16
Yeah.

417
00:24:09.16 --> 00:24:11.16
And that's where that kind of experience.

418
00:24:11.16 --> 00:24:18.16
Well, I'm training a coming in and a lot of it can be things that aren't really conscious too.

419
00:24:18.16 --> 00:24:22.16
And it comes with, like, let's say, you know, in a relationship situation.

420
00:24:22.16 --> 00:24:23.16
Let's say, I know.

421
00:24:23.16 --> 00:24:25.16
You sit over here trying to talk about what?

422
00:24:25.16 --> 00:24:27.16
You want to go straight to a relationship?

423
00:24:27.16 --> 00:24:28.16
This early in the show.

424
00:24:28.16 --> 00:24:29.16
I do.

425
00:24:29.16 --> 00:24:32.16
Like, that even necessarily saying, you know, romantic or boyfriend or friend,

426
00:24:32.16 --> 00:24:35.16
any kind of relationship, if you know the person really well,

427
00:24:35.16 --> 00:24:38.16
you can tell on something's off just a little bit.

428
00:24:38.16 --> 00:24:40.16
People say, hey, something, buddy, they guy would be like, oh, no, no, all good.

429
00:24:40.16 --> 00:24:43.16
And they can, you know, they can be real convincing.

430
00:24:43.16 --> 00:24:44.16
Yeah, I know.

431
00:24:44.16 --> 00:24:45.16
I'm all good.

432
00:24:45.16 --> 00:24:47.16
But you know, your instinct because you have so much experience with them, you know?

433
00:24:47.16 --> 00:24:48.16
Yes, you're right.

434
00:24:48.16 --> 00:24:49.16
And you're right.

435
00:24:49.16 --> 00:24:54.16
And the fact that, you know, when I talk about the escalation, right, if you come in and you say,

436
00:24:54.16 --> 00:24:57.16
hey, juggle, this is crap with the way we're doing this.

437
00:24:57.16 --> 00:25:00.16
If my instinct is like, no, it's not crap.

438
00:25:00.16 --> 00:25:01.16
That's my instinct if it was small.

439
00:25:01.16 --> 00:25:02.16
It's like, no, screw you.

440
00:25:02.16 --> 00:25:03.16
I'm right.

441
00:25:03.16 --> 00:25:04.16
You're wrong.

442
00:25:04.16 --> 00:25:07.16
But what I really need to do is say, hold on a second.

443
00:25:07.16 --> 00:25:08.16
Detach.

444
00:25:08.16 --> 00:25:10.16
Let's assess what echo say or echo normally doesn't do this.

445
00:25:10.16 --> 00:25:11.16
Right.

446
00:25:11.16 --> 00:25:12.16
Why is he doing this?

447
00:25:12.16 --> 00:25:13.16
Something is going on.

448
00:25:13.16 --> 00:25:15.16
Don't I'm not going to touch my instinct, right?

449
00:25:15.16 --> 00:25:19.16
Now luckily, like you said, through training, through knowledge, right, in the situation,

450
00:25:19.16 --> 00:25:21.16
I know that you don't act that way.

451
00:25:21.16 --> 00:25:27.16
So yes, follow your instincts, follow your intuition, but make sure that you train to develop

452
00:25:27.16 --> 00:25:30.16
them and also, I like to question them.

453
00:25:30.16 --> 00:25:33.16
When I feel something, I just don't go with it immediately.

454
00:25:33.16 --> 00:25:34.16
I want to go with it.

455
00:25:34.16 --> 00:25:36.16
And I most likely will go with it.

456
00:25:36.16 --> 00:25:39.16
But there's also a possibility I say, well, not a possibility.

457
00:25:39.16 --> 00:25:41.16
But when I say, hey, we need to move here.

458
00:25:41.16 --> 00:25:43.16
I go, okay, what could be happening?

459
00:25:43.16 --> 00:25:45.16
Is this a position that the enemy might be in?

460
00:25:45.16 --> 00:25:48.16
Is this a move that could be getting set up on me?

461
00:25:48.16 --> 00:25:51.16
No, I think I'm pretty solid or at least as I move them,

462
00:25:51.16 --> 00:25:52.16
I'm going to be aware of it.

463
00:25:52.16 --> 00:25:55.16
I'm trusting my instinct, but I'm being cautious.

464
00:25:55.16 --> 00:25:56.16
Yeah.

465
00:25:56.16 --> 00:25:57.16
Yes, good.

466
00:25:57.16 --> 00:26:01.16
You hear that talking police, you know, like cops have like good in, in the first.

467
00:26:01.16 --> 00:26:02.16
Oh, for sure.

468
00:26:02.16 --> 00:26:04.16
Because like the repetitious patterns.

469
00:26:04.16 --> 00:26:05.16
First of bad guys.

470
00:26:05.16 --> 00:26:06.16
Yeah, for sure.

471
00:26:06.16 --> 00:26:08.16
I was going to say something else too.

472
00:26:08.16 --> 00:26:11.16
Oh, there's plenty of times.

473
00:26:11.16 --> 00:26:15.16
Where if you don't trust your instinct, you will get crushed.

474
00:26:15.16 --> 00:26:16.16
Right?

475
00:26:16.16 --> 00:26:19.16
I mean, you think about in a jiu-jitsu perspective.

476
00:26:19.16 --> 00:26:22.16
But when you get good, you're not thinking about anything.

477
00:26:22.16 --> 00:26:24.16
You have to just use your instinct.

478
00:26:24.16 --> 00:26:25.16
You're training.

479
00:26:25.16 --> 00:26:27.16
Your muscle memory is what's working.

480
00:26:27.16 --> 00:26:29.16
And the same thing with police, you know, they get to a point.

481
00:26:29.16 --> 00:26:31.16
You get into a situation.

482
00:26:31.16 --> 00:26:35.16
If they're not going off their instinct, they're going to get burned.

483
00:26:35.16 --> 00:26:37.16
Yeah, because they learned.

484
00:26:37.16 --> 00:26:39.16
Yeah, and that's the trained instinct.

485
00:26:39.16 --> 00:26:41.16
You're saying like that's the trained instinct.

486
00:26:41.16 --> 00:26:41.16
Right.

487
00:26:41.16 --> 00:26:43.16
You know, as opposed to the untrained instinct, yes, you can kind of get.

488
00:26:43.16 --> 00:26:46.16
They won being a police officer out on the beat.

489
00:26:46.16 --> 00:26:51.16
They're not going to have, they're not going to have any, a fraction of what you do with that cop 10 years later.

490
00:26:51.16 --> 00:26:55.16
And you, and that cop's like, hey, listen, I see your hand.

491
00:26:55.16 --> 00:26:57.16
I see you got some blood on your knuckles.

492
00:26:57.16 --> 00:26:58.16
I know what happened.

493
00:26:58.16 --> 00:26:59.16
You're telling me what's going on.

494
00:26:59.16 --> 00:27:00.16
You don't even mean?

495
00:27:00.16 --> 00:27:00.16
Yeah.

496
00:27:00.16 --> 00:27:02.16
Whereas a young guy might be a little too old.

497
00:27:02.16 --> 00:27:03.16
Yeah.

498
00:27:03.16 --> 00:27:03.16
Yeah.

499
00:27:03.16 --> 00:27:04.16
Can you face about something?

500
00:27:04.16 --> 00:27:06.16
Yeah, or guys like being too nice.

501
00:27:06.16 --> 00:27:08.16
You know how like the cop can tell like, oh, this guy's being too nice.

502
00:27:08.16 --> 00:27:09.16
Yeah.

503
00:27:09.16 --> 00:27:10.16
You know what I mean?

504
00:27:10.16 --> 00:27:15.16
There's like a mediocre level of niceness that's like, okay, that seems like he's melal, but if

505
00:27:15.16 --> 00:27:19.16
you guys mean like too aggressive or too defensive or too nice, they can tell.

506
00:27:19.16 --> 00:27:20.16
Yeah.

507
00:27:20.16 --> 00:27:23.16
You know, there's something up suspicious, you know, maybe a new guy might be not be able to tell that.

508
00:27:23.16 --> 00:27:24.16
You know what I mean?

509
00:27:24.16 --> 00:27:25.16
Yeah.

510
00:27:25.16 --> 00:27:26.16
No, absolutely.

511
00:27:26.16 --> 00:27:27.16
All right.

512
00:27:27.16 --> 00:27:28.16
Next one.

513
00:27:28.16 --> 00:27:30.16
Number five.

514
00:27:30.16 --> 00:27:35.16
Use standard unit fire and battle drills.

515
00:27:35.16 --> 00:27:41.66
Aim to overwhelm the enemy upon contact and retain the initiative through speed of action.

516
00:27:41.66 --> 00:27:47.16
As Sergeant Koch fired the main gun and destroyed the first tank, I sent a contact report

517
00:27:47.16 --> 00:27:48.16
to the troop.

518
00:27:48.16 --> 00:27:50.16
This is Black 6.

519
00:27:50.16 --> 00:27:51.16
Contact East.

520
00:27:51.16 --> 00:27:52.16
Eight armored vehicles.

521
00:27:52.16 --> 00:27:53.16
Green and white.

522
00:27:53.16 --> 00:27:54.16
You with me?

523
00:27:54.16 --> 00:27:59.16
Sergeant Koch destroyed two more tanks as our tank platoon to accelerate movement.

524
00:27:59.16 --> 00:28:03.16
All nine tanks began engaging together as we advanced.

525
00:28:03.16 --> 00:28:06.16
Approximately one minute.

526
00:28:06.16 --> 00:28:09.16
Everything in the range of our guns was in flames.

527
00:28:09.16 --> 00:28:16.16
Fire distribution and control allowed us to destroy a much larger enemy force in a very short

528
00:28:16.16 --> 00:28:19.16
period of time.

529
00:28:19.16 --> 00:28:21.16
So how do they do that?

530
00:28:21.16 --> 00:28:25.16
Good solid discipline standard operating procedures.

531
00:28:25.16 --> 00:28:29.16
And you, I'm telling you, you think about how simple this is.

532
00:28:29.16 --> 00:28:33.16
He says this is Black says contact East eight armored vehicles.

533
00:28:33.16 --> 00:28:35.16
Green, why are you with me?

534
00:28:35.16 --> 00:28:37.16
That's the whole.

535
00:28:37.16 --> 00:28:39.16
That's the whole detail plan.

536
00:28:39.16 --> 00:28:41.16
Hey, there's bad guys over there.

537
00:28:41.16 --> 00:28:42.16
We're moving east.

538
00:28:42.16 --> 00:28:43.16
Let's go.

539
00:28:43.16 --> 00:28:47.16
And everybody says, all right, we've done this thousands of times.

540
00:28:47.16 --> 00:28:48.16
We've drilled it.

541
00:28:48.16 --> 00:28:49.16
We rehearsed it.

542
00:28:49.16 --> 00:28:50.16
What do we do right now?

543
00:28:50.16 --> 00:28:53.16
And they probably had little standard operating procedures.

544
00:28:53.16 --> 00:28:56.16
Hey, guys on the, you know, on the left flank are going to start flying at the left

545
00:28:56.16 --> 00:28:57.16
vehicles.

546
00:28:57.16 --> 00:29:01.16
They, they handle all these procedures work out so that in less than a minute,

547
00:29:01.16 --> 00:29:04.16
victory, less than a minute.

548
00:29:04.16 --> 00:29:08.16
So develop those good standard operating procedures,

549
00:29:08.16 --> 00:29:10.16
disciplined procedures.

550
00:29:10.16 --> 00:29:14.16
And when I talk about freedom on the battlefield, this is exactly what I'm talking about.

551
00:29:14.16 --> 00:29:16.16
Discipline equals freedom on the battlefield.

552
00:29:16.16 --> 00:29:19.16
Because when you have those disciplined procedures, he doesn't even have to see it.

553
00:29:19.16 --> 00:29:20.16
The freedom to maneuver.

554
00:29:20.16 --> 00:29:22.16
He has the freedom just to say, hey, guys, there's the enemy.

555
00:29:22.16 --> 00:29:23.16
Let's take care of him.

556
00:29:23.16 --> 00:29:24.16
Boom, it's done.

557
00:29:24.16 --> 00:29:28.16
Yeah. Next one.

558
00:29:28.16 --> 00:29:32.16
Number six, foster initiative.

559
00:29:32.16 --> 00:29:38.16
Every trooper understood how our platoons and the troop conducted fire in maneuver.

560
00:29:38.16 --> 00:29:41.16
Our tank driver, specialist,

561
00:29:41.16 --> 00:29:49.16
Christopher Heedensog, knew that he had to steer a path that permitted both tank platoons to get their guns into the fight.

562
00:29:49.16 --> 00:29:55.16
He turned 45 degrees to the right and kept our frontal armor towards the first enemy tanks we engaged.

563
00:29:55.16 --> 00:29:59.16
He drove through a minefield, avoided the anti-tank mines reporting on the intercom.

564
00:29:59.16 --> 00:30:03.16
Sir, I need you to know we just went through a minefield.

565
00:30:03.16 --> 00:30:07.16
He knew that it would be dangerous to stop right in the middle of the enemy kill zone.

566
00:30:07.16 --> 00:30:16.16
Heedensog saw that our tank platoons had a window of opportunity to shock the enemy and take advantage of the first blows that Sergeant Cots delivered.

567
00:30:16.16 --> 00:30:20.16
So, clearly this is decentralized command, right?

568
00:30:20.16 --> 00:30:22.16
And you just think about this first.

569
00:30:22.16 --> 00:30:26.16
Every trooper understood how our platoons and the troop conducted fire maneuver.

570
00:30:26.16 --> 00:30:28.16
Everybody knows what to do.

571
00:30:28.16 --> 00:30:30.16
Everybody.

572
00:30:30.16 --> 00:30:32.16
And here's this kid.

573
00:30:32.16 --> 00:30:34.16
He's probably 18 years old.

574
00:30:34.16 --> 00:30:35.16
What is he a specialist?

575
00:30:35.16 --> 00:30:36.16
Yeah, especially.

576
00:30:36.16 --> 00:30:37.16
He's probably 19 years old.

577
00:30:37.16 --> 00:30:38.16
And he's got eating.

578
00:30:38.16 --> 00:30:39.16
Right?

579
00:30:39.16 --> 00:30:44.16
The commanders in charge, but there's a guy that's driving that's picking the course where they're going to go.

580
00:30:44.16 --> 00:30:46.16
And again, think about this.

581
00:30:46.16 --> 00:30:50.16
The captain, he's not saying like, eight, six degrees left, six degrees to the right.

582
00:30:50.16 --> 00:30:53.16
Get 40, no, he's not giving any of those orders.

583
00:30:53.16 --> 00:30:56.16
And if you think about it, could he have been able to do that?

584
00:30:56.16 --> 00:30:57.16
He's dealing with all this other stuff.

585
00:30:57.16 --> 00:30:58.16
He's dealing with fire control.

586
00:30:58.16 --> 00:31:01.16
He's dealing with the position he's reporting back up.

587
00:31:01.16 --> 00:31:02.16
The cheese got all this other stuff going on.

588
00:31:02.16 --> 00:31:07.16
He doesn't have time to tell this guy where to go, but it's decentralized command.

589
00:31:07.16 --> 00:31:13.16
That specialist that is leading the tanks from an actual driving perspective.

590
00:31:13.16 --> 00:31:16.16
He knows what to do.

591
00:31:16.16 --> 00:31:18.16
He knows the procedures.

592
00:31:18.16 --> 00:31:20.16
And so he's able just to do it.

593
00:31:20.16 --> 00:31:26.16
He even knows he knows it so well that when he sees that we're in a mine field, he assesses the threat.

594
00:31:26.16 --> 00:31:28.16
Okay, we're in a mine field by C3 mines.

595
00:31:28.16 --> 00:31:30.16
I'm going to steer around them the best I can.

596
00:31:30.16 --> 00:31:35.16
But if we stop, we're going to be open to getting attacked by the enemy.

597
00:31:35.16 --> 00:31:37.16
So you know where to do, we're going to keep moving.

598
00:31:37.16 --> 00:31:39.16
And he made that decision on his own.

599
00:31:39.16 --> 00:31:44.16
Because he understood the overall objective and the procedures that they would follow.

600
00:31:44.16 --> 00:31:46.16
And what was most important.

601
00:31:46.16 --> 00:31:51.16
So that's a great example of decentralized command.

602
00:31:51.16 --> 00:31:54.16
Number seven.

603
00:31:54.16 --> 00:31:57.16
Use tanks to take the brunt of the battle.

604
00:31:57.16 --> 00:32:08.16
Tanks drove around the anti tank mines and Bradley's and other vehicles followed in their tracks.

605
00:32:08.16 --> 00:32:16.16
Our squadrons S3 tank commanded by major Douglas MacArthur, McGregor, hit an anti tank mine.

606
00:32:16.16 --> 00:32:19.16
But the blast damage the tank only slightly.

607
00:32:19.16 --> 00:32:22.16
It continued the attack and made a repair when we halted.

608
00:32:22.16 --> 00:32:30.16
We ran over anti personnel mines, but they sounded like microwave popcorn popping and had no effect on armored vehicles.

609
00:32:30.16 --> 00:32:41.16
The rate of our fire of our tanks allowed enemy tanks to fire only two airant main gun rounds at the outside of the battle.

610
00:32:41.16 --> 00:32:44.16
And two later as the troop assaulted.

611
00:32:44.16 --> 00:32:48.16
And we machine gun fire had no effect on the troop's advance.

612
00:32:48.16 --> 00:32:57.16
The psychological shock of our tanks advancing undontered toward their defensive positions paralyzed and panicked the enemy.

613
00:32:57.16 --> 00:33:05.16
So if you don't know anything about what I'm talking about, I apologize.

614
00:33:05.16 --> 00:33:11.16
But tanks are massive, A1 Abrams tanks are massive and they have extremely heavy armor.

615
00:33:11.16 --> 00:33:20.16
They're 68 tons and as you say in here, these even the anti tank mines aren't stopping the tanks.

616
00:33:20.16 --> 00:33:25.16
And the anti personnel just is nothing.

617
00:33:25.16 --> 00:33:30.16
But the Bradley's are smaller, not as big and not as big and not as heavily armored.

618
00:33:30.16 --> 00:33:38.16
So the tanks are driving and then the Bradley's are just falling into tracks in case they hit any mines.

619
00:33:38.16 --> 00:33:41.16
They would hit the Abrams tank.

620
00:33:41.16 --> 00:33:46.16
But what I want to say, what I take about is, how can we apply this to everyday life?

621
00:33:46.16 --> 00:33:48.16
How can we apply this to business?

622
00:33:48.16 --> 00:33:53.16
You know, they're saying technically specifically use tanks to take the run of the battle, right?

623
00:33:53.16 --> 00:33:55.16
This is the way I look at this.

624
00:33:55.16 --> 00:34:04.16
From a business perspective and from a life perspective, play to your strength.

625
00:34:04.16 --> 00:34:07.16
Right? What is the strongest thing they've got are these tanks?

626
00:34:07.16 --> 00:34:13.16
And it's the same thing that we run into in business and it's the same thing you run into in life and you get to everywhere.

627
00:34:13.16 --> 00:34:18.16
What are you, what are you strong at? What are your strong air is that's what you focus on.

628
00:34:18.16 --> 00:34:21.16
That's what you use to lead your advance.

629
00:34:21.16 --> 00:34:25.16
Now, do we train for our weaknesses? Absolutely.

630
00:34:25.16 --> 00:34:30.16
You know, we do that all the time. Do we, when we have a weakness in a business, we don't go, hey, let's just cover this up.

631
00:34:30.16 --> 00:34:34.16
No, we focus on it so that we can prove it.

632
00:34:34.16 --> 00:34:39.16
But if we're going to go to market with something, let's go to market with something that we're good at.

633
00:34:39.16 --> 00:34:46.16
Mm-hmm. Right? If we're going to, if we're going to try and set up some expansion into a new area,

634
00:34:46.16 --> 00:34:52.16
let's set up the expansion into an area area that we're familiar with. That we're good at. That we're strong in.

635
00:34:52.16 --> 00:34:58.16
Let's not say, hey, you know what, we've been making, we've been making cars for the last 50 years.

636
00:34:58.16 --> 00:35:03.16
Let's go over here and make computers. No, we're going to make cars. Okay, let's make trucks too.

637
00:35:03.16 --> 00:35:06.16
We know how to build vehicles. That's what I'm saying.

638
00:35:06.16 --> 00:35:15.16
And this is, and you see this all the time with GJ, what do GJ2 guys do? What they should do, which is try and try and play to your strengths.

639
00:35:15.16 --> 00:35:22.16
Right? In competition. Right? Of course, when we're training, we pray to our weaknesses.

640
00:35:22.16 --> 00:35:27.16
Right? We want to, oh, I'm, I don't like people being across side. Cool. Let them get across side.

641
00:35:27.16 --> 00:35:31.16
Yeah. I don't like being on the bottom. Cool. I'm going to be on the bottom.

642
00:35:31.16 --> 00:35:36.16
But in competition, what are you good at? How do you get the person to play your game? That's the question.

643
00:35:36.16 --> 00:35:41.16
Yeah, and that's everything, too. Right? Like even at work. You're going to train the new guys,

644
00:35:41.16 --> 00:35:47.16
but you're not going to send the new guy to make contact with the potential client. The big client.

645
00:35:47.16 --> 00:35:53.16
Yeah. Don't send the new guy, send the strongest. And the tank. Send the M1 Abrac to meet the new client.

646
00:35:53.16 --> 00:36:00.16
That's got big potential. So play to your strengths. Use tanks to take the brunt of the battle.

647
00:36:00.16 --> 00:36:07.16
Next, be prepared for misfires and degraded operations.

648
00:36:07.16 --> 00:36:14.16
Lieutenant Jeff Disafontos, tank crew came around the village, destroyed an enemy tank,

649
00:36:14.16 --> 00:36:19.16
and acquired a second tank at very close range that was traversing on them.

650
00:36:19.16 --> 00:36:26.16
Around got stuck in the breach of the cannon, meaning this, this cannon's not going to shoot anymore.

651
00:36:26.16 --> 00:36:30.16
The loader grabbed hold of the loader's hatch, kicked around in.

652
00:36:30.16 --> 00:36:35.16
The breach came up in the gunner, Sergeant Matthew Clark destroyed the T72.

653
00:36:35.16 --> 00:36:44.16
In another example, Staff Sergeant Digby ordered private first class Charles Burtubin to reload tow missiles.

654
00:36:44.16 --> 00:36:49.16
Burtubin could not get the cargo hatch open, however.

655
00:36:49.16 --> 00:36:53.16
When the lightweight wrestler, got his wrestler, good for him.

656
00:36:53.16 --> 00:36:57.16
Kick the hatch release, he sheared it off. Rather than tell Bradley,

657
00:36:57.16 --> 00:37:02.16
his Bradley commander that he could not get the tows reloaded. He jumped out of the back door while the vehicle

658
00:37:02.16 --> 00:37:07.16
was under small arms and machine gun fire. He climbed onto the back of the Bradley loaded both missiles,

659
00:37:07.16 --> 00:37:11.16
then tapped the Bradley commander on the shoulder while yelling tows are up.

660
00:37:11.16 --> 00:37:15.16
Staff Sergeant Digby nearly jumped out of his skin because he thought and I racked,

661
00:37:15.16 --> 00:37:17.16
climbed onto the Bradley.

662
00:37:17.16 --> 00:37:23.16
So here's these little malfunctions going on with your weapons and what do you do?

663
00:37:23.16 --> 00:37:29.16
You deal with it. And I think I said this on the last podcast with Lave.

664
00:37:29.16 --> 00:37:34.16
We have a little saying nothing works. Everything sucks.

665
00:37:34.16 --> 00:37:38.16
That's what you got to prepare for. You count if you rely a hundred percent on those radios,

666
00:37:38.16 --> 00:37:41.16
those radios aren't going to work. If you rely a hundred percent on your weapon,

667
00:37:41.16 --> 00:37:48.16
okay, you better learn those drills, you better learn how to how to fix and adjust your weapon very quickly,

668
00:37:48.16 --> 00:37:51.16
go to your secondary, whatever the case may be, you've got to drill those things.

669
00:37:51.16 --> 00:37:57.16
You've got to be ready for problems. You got to be ready for Murphy's Law to kick in.

670
00:37:57.16 --> 00:38:00.16
Next, number nine.

671
00:38:00.16 --> 00:38:05.16
Coordinate between Patoons and Ensure Mutual Support.

672
00:38:05.16 --> 00:38:11.16
The Burning Tanks and Personnel carriers of the enemies first defensive line formed a curtain of smoke

673
00:38:11.16 --> 00:38:14.16
that concealed enemy further to the east.

674
00:38:14.16 --> 00:38:19.16
As our tanks assaulted through the smoke, we saw other enemy armor vehicles and large numbers of infantry

675
00:38:19.16 --> 00:38:23.16
running to get back to subsequent trench lines and positions.

676
00:38:23.16 --> 00:38:28.16
We destroyed the enemy armor vehicles quickly and shot the infantry with machine guns

677
00:38:28.16 --> 00:38:30.16
as we close the distance with them.

678
00:38:30.16 --> 00:38:35.16
Pockets of enemy soldiers threw up their arms. Our soldiers were disciplined.

679
00:38:35.16 --> 00:38:40.16
Turrets turned away from any enemy soldier with his hands raised.

680
00:38:40.16 --> 00:38:47.16
Tanked platoon leaders asked to scout platoon to pick up observation of the enemy infantry

681
00:38:47.16 --> 00:38:49.16
as their Bradley's came through the smoke.

682
00:38:49.16 --> 00:38:55.16
The scout saw that the enemy had used a false surrender to gain a better position.

683
00:38:55.16 --> 00:39:00.16
Enemy soldiers were reshulding their rifles and rocket-papeled grenades.

684
00:39:00.16 --> 00:39:07.16
Our Bradley surprised the enemy and killed them before they could engage our tanks effectively.

685
00:39:07.16 --> 00:39:09.16
Covern move.

686
00:39:09.16 --> 00:39:12.16
Covern move real simple.

687
00:39:12.16 --> 00:39:14.16
That's what that one is.

688
00:39:14.16 --> 00:39:18.16
Mutually supporting. That means we're helping each other out. That's what cover move is.

689
00:39:18.16 --> 00:39:23.16
Next. Number 10.

690
00:39:23.16 --> 00:39:26.16
Take risk to win.

691
00:39:26.16 --> 00:39:33.16
Because eagle true pressed the assault, the enemy could not respond effectively.

692
00:39:33.16 --> 00:39:38.16
Right. That's that. You're going to find that. In any case, you want to get the person on their heels.

693
00:39:38.16 --> 00:39:40.16
You want to get your opponent on their heels.

694
00:39:40.16 --> 00:39:45.16
As we cleared the Western most defensive positions, our executive officer,

695
00:39:45.16 --> 00:39:48.16
Lieutenant John Gifford broken on the radio.

696
00:39:48.16 --> 00:39:53.16
I know you don't want to know this right now, but you are at the limit of advance.

697
00:39:53.16 --> 00:39:57.16
You are at the 70 East. I responded. Tell them we can't stop.

698
00:39:57.16 --> 00:40:01.16
Tell them we're in a contact and we have to continue this attack. Tell them I'm sorry.

699
00:40:01.16 --> 00:40:07.16
That's a part I already covered. We had surprised and shocked the enemy.

700
00:40:07.16 --> 00:40:15.16
Stopping would have allowed them to recover as early in Rommel observed in infantry attacks.

701
00:40:15.16 --> 00:40:21.16
The man who lies low and awaits developments usually comes off second best.

702
00:40:21.16 --> 00:40:31.16
It is fundamentally wrong to halt or to wait for more forces to come up and take part in the action.

703
00:40:31.16 --> 00:40:38.16
Eagle troop continued to attack toward another very subtle ridge line on the enemy position.

704
00:40:38.16 --> 00:40:44.16
On which the enemy position his reserve a coil of 18 T72 tanks.

705
00:40:44.16 --> 00:40:49.16
Major Muhammad later told one of our troopers. This is the enemy commander of this unit.

706
00:40:49.16 --> 00:40:53.16
Major Muhammad later told one of our troopers that he had not known.

707
00:40:53.16 --> 00:40:59.16
He was under attack until a soldier ran into his elaborate command bunker yelling tanks tanks.

708
00:40:59.16 --> 00:41:06.16
By the time he got to his observation post all the vehicles in defense of positions to the west were in flames.

709
00:41:06.16 --> 00:41:11.16
He ordered the reserve behind him to establish a second defense of line.

710
00:41:11.16 --> 00:41:18.16
It was too late. The Eagle troops tank, crested the rise and entered their assembly area.

711
00:41:18.16 --> 00:41:25.16
The tanks were starting to move out when we destroyed them at close range.

712
00:41:25.16 --> 00:41:31.16
So it's not only take risk it's to be aggressive. That's got to be your default mode.

713
00:41:31.16 --> 00:41:34.16
Default mode is aggressive. Press that attack.

714
00:41:34.16 --> 00:41:41.16
It's interesting when I'm clearly at happens in combat you start getting the upper hand keep going.

715
00:41:41.16 --> 00:41:45.16
Keep going and it happens in Gitu as well.

716
00:41:45.16 --> 00:41:50.16
You know if you can get that person on the run you're attacking him with two three four different things at the same time.

717
00:41:50.16 --> 00:41:52.16
That's when they're done.

718
00:41:52.16 --> 00:41:56.16
You're a bad feeling when you're when that's happening to you. You fall in behind in the Udloup.

719
00:41:56.16 --> 00:42:00.16
And they're just getting getting all inside your loop. You're defending something.

720
00:42:00.16 --> 00:42:02.16
You feel the other thing happening.

721
00:42:02.16 --> 00:42:03.16
Yeah.

722
00:42:03.16 --> 00:42:04.16
Not good.

723
00:42:04.16 --> 00:42:08.16
But again take risk but yes be aggressive.

724
00:42:08.16 --> 00:42:15.16
Now those word v lessons from this this one battle.

725
00:42:15.16 --> 00:42:20.16
You know this one battle at 73 East and now.

726
00:42:20.16 --> 00:42:25.16
Obviously McMaster said in the army he went up through the chain of command.

727
00:42:25.16 --> 00:42:32.16
And now we're going to go to 2005 2006 the battle of Tallah Far.

728
00:42:32.16 --> 00:42:39.16
You know I rack which this battle was led by who is now a Colonel McMaster.

729
00:42:39.16 --> 00:42:42.16
He was a captain at the time of this 73 East and battle.

730
00:42:42.16 --> 00:42:48.16
Now he's a commander. He's commanding the third ACR the third Armored Cavalry Regiment.

731
00:42:48.16 --> 00:42:56.16
And this is very similar to the battle of Ramadi. What happened in Tallah Far.

732
00:42:56.16 --> 00:43:02.16
And the reason one of the reasons why it's so similar is that Colonel McFarland,

733
00:43:02.16 --> 00:43:10.16
who was the commander of the one one AD that led the fight in Ramadi that I was there to support.

734
00:43:10.16 --> 00:43:17.16
The first thing he did when he went back to Iraq when McFarland went back to Iraq for that deployment in 2006.

735
00:43:17.16 --> 00:43:22.16
He took over for McMaster and McMaster was in Tallah Far.

736
00:43:22.16 --> 00:43:27.16
So McFarland shows up in Tallah Far and says hey this is what I did.

737
00:43:27.16 --> 00:43:30.16
I did a little something called Seas Clear Hold and built.

738
00:43:30.16 --> 00:43:33.16
This is the strategy we pushed into these end-making control territories.

739
00:43:33.16 --> 00:43:45.16
And then it becomes so pacified in Tallah Far that they were able to take most of the one one AD and send them down to Ramadi.

740
00:43:45.16 --> 00:43:51.16
And when they got down to Ramadi McFarland, who's a brilliant guy, had listened to everything McMaster said,

741
00:43:51.16 --> 00:43:56.16
looked at how he did it and then applied the same strategy in Ramadi.

742
00:43:56.16 --> 00:43:59.16
Now he had to make adjustments to it for sure because it wasn't exactly the same.

743
00:43:59.16 --> 00:44:03.16
But luckily he used a smart creative guy that said oh we got to make adjustments but he did it.

744
00:44:03.16 --> 00:44:12.16
But the overall concept came from what McMaster did up in Tallah Far.

745
00:44:12.16 --> 00:44:23.16
And so there was an article in the New Yorker written by a guy named George Packer and the article is called The Lesson of Tallah Far.

746
00:44:23.16 --> 00:44:29.16
Is it too late for the administration to correct its course in Iraq?

747
00:44:29.16 --> 00:44:39.16
And this article came out April 10th 2006 probably three or four days before I arrived in Ramadi in 2006.

748
00:44:39.16 --> 00:44:46.16
So that's when this article came out and you can see he's saying hey look is it too late to correct the course?

749
00:44:46.16 --> 00:44:53.16
Well actually a lot of people in 2006 weren't even admitting that we were all in the wrong course.

750
00:44:53.16 --> 00:44:57.16
You know because what we were doing at that time and I've talked about this a bunch.

751
00:44:57.16 --> 00:45:04.16
What America had been doing at that time is going out grabbing bad guys.

752
00:45:04.16 --> 00:45:10.16
I wanted a time to have been bringing them back to base and putting them arresting them capture kill missions.

753
00:45:10.16 --> 00:45:21.16
And what's interesting is that's that's an attrition that's a war of attrition right you have certain number of bad guys we're going to go catch them all.

754
00:45:21.16 --> 00:45:24.16
And it really wasn't working.

755
00:45:24.16 --> 00:45:33.16
It really wasn't working that's why in 2005 2006 enemy attacks were up 300% and you know 2005 2006 are whole country.

756
00:45:33.16 --> 00:45:43.16
Well I shouldn't say our whole country but many people in our country including a lot of major politicians were saying it was unwinnable and you know we just need to get out and it was cragmiron all that stuff.

757
00:45:43.16 --> 00:45:59.16
So that's because we were not on the right strategy and actually if you take this and you apply it back to Hackworth when he basically said during the end of the Vietnam War and he said look we're not going to win.

758
00:45:59.16 --> 00:46:10.16
It wasn't talking about we couldn't win. He was saying we're fighting the wrong kind of tactics we're doing the wrong thing here. You keep saying hey what's our body count what's our body count that's a war of attrition.

759
00:46:10.16 --> 00:46:28.16
Hey we lost as many guys you lost that many that's an attrition warfare it's one or one I always use World War One is the classic attrition warfare hey we're going to go over the trench we're going to kill as many of you is you can and hopefully it's less than we'll ask them we're going to see you can last longer that's a punch that's that's hey echo we're just going to stand here you punch me all punch you you punch me and whoever goes down.

760
00:46:28.16 --> 00:46:36.16
You know loses well guess what what we look like at the end of that we're all beat up right both of us doesn't matter doesn't matter how good we are.

761
00:46:36.16 --> 00:46:47.16
So these guys were thinking maybe instead of doing punches the face we should do little jjitsu a little something a little bit more tactically sound and it wasn't.

762
00:46:47.16 --> 00:47:01.64
Just go out grab bad guys just go out and try and kill bad guys because we learned 2003 2004 2005 that's three years of doing those type of operations and real progress wasn't being made it certainly wasn't made in in

763
00:47:01.64 --> 00:47:16.64
Remodiate this point again there was guys that were doing incredible work and you do have to go out and and attack the bad guys and go after those critical notes for sure.

764
00:47:16.64 --> 00:47:35.64
And politically other other areas that needed to be addressed. So this article came out and again it's from the New Yorker written by George Packer came out April 10 2006 and here we're going to this article back to the article.

765
00:47:35.64 --> 00:47:46.64
This is the McMaster and his soldiers applied in Tallahafar were learned during the first two years of an increase in the unpopular war. When we came to Iraq we didn't understand the complexity.

766
00:47:46.64 --> 00:47:53.64
What it meant for a society to live under brutal dictatorship with ethnic and sectarian divisions.

767
00:47:53.64 --> 00:48:06.64
He said in his course energetic voice when we first got here we made a lot of mistakes. We were like a blind man trying to do the right thing but breaking a lot of things.

768
00:48:06.64 --> 00:48:16.64
Later he said you got to come in with your ears open you can't come in and start talking you really have to listen to people.

769
00:48:16.64 --> 00:48:29.64
I mean okay that is just this whole thing is just a great summary of a humble man right he's saying look when we came here we didn't understand the complexity.

770
00:48:29.64 --> 00:48:39.64
That's humility he says we didn't understand what it was like to live under brutal dictatorship that's humble he says when we first got here we made a lot of mistakes.

771
00:48:39.64 --> 00:48:48.64
He's not saying all we did everything right no we made a lot of mistakes. We were like a blind man trying to do the right thing but breaking a lot of things so they're trying.

772
00:48:48.64 --> 00:48:53.64
He admits that we're trying but we're breaking a lot of stuff later he said.

773
00:48:53.64 --> 00:49:06.64
Listen this you got to come in with your ears open you can't come in and start talking okay leaders around the world pay attention to that right there you don't need to come in and start talking.

774
00:49:06.64 --> 00:49:14.64
Come in with your ears open and listen and he says you really have to listen to people.

775
00:49:14.64 --> 00:49:18.64
Very clear very great leadership guidance right there.

776
00:49:18.64 --> 00:49:34.64
Back to the article. They didn't even want to say the I word one officer told me it was the specter of Vietnam they did not want to say the insurgency word because the next word you say is quagmire.

777
00:49:34.64 --> 00:49:40.64
The next thing you say is the only war America has lost Vietnam.

778
00:49:40.64 --> 00:49:49.64
And the next thing you conclude is that certain people's vision of war is wrong so.

779
00:49:49.64 --> 00:49:53.64
We had a hard time again just as America.

780
00:49:53.64 --> 00:50:03.64
Admitting hey this isn't just a bunch of thugs running around there's an organized insurgency here we needed fight it like an insurgency we had a hard time making that mental transition as a nation.

781
00:50:03.64 --> 00:50:18.64
And I'll tell you when I I've told the story before when I got to Ramadi and I looked it was going on I literally read the counter insurgency manual that was written by basically by general portrays who's a brilliant guy and these guys McMaster.

782
00:50:18.64 --> 00:50:22.64
I think McFarlane they all helped him write that article.

783
00:50:22.64 --> 00:50:39.64
I write that book so this was a totally different attitude and you know you hear it here that people people back in DC they didn't even want to use the word insurgency they didn't want to use that word because it makes everyone think of nom.

784
00:50:39.64 --> 00:50:44.64
And we lost right.

785
00:50:44.64 --> 00:51:00.64
So the article going going a little bit deeper on that. Back to the article the Pentagon strategy in 2003 and 2004 was to capture was to combat the insurgency simply by eliminating insurgence and approach called.

786
00:51:00.64 --> 00:51:02.64
Kill capture.

787
00:51:02.64 --> 00:51:13.64
Colleve, SEP, a retired special forces officer who now teaches at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California set of the method it's all about hunting people.

788
00:51:13.64 --> 00:51:20.64
I think it comes directly from the secretary defense I want heads on a plate so he's talking about wrongs.

789
00:51:20.64 --> 00:51:33.64
You'll get some people that way, but the failure of that approach is evident. They get who's saying they get his sons they continue to work every week to kill more capture more.

790
00:51:33.64 --> 00:51:41.64
They've got facilities full of thousands of detainees yet there's more insurgence than there were when we started.

791
00:51:41.64 --> 00:51:52.64
In dereliction of duty McMaster wrote that strategy of attrition was in essence the absence of a strategy.

792
00:51:52.64 --> 00:51:55.64
What a great line that is right.

793
00:51:55.64 --> 00:52:09.64
And so McMaster wrote a very harsh critique of the Vietnam War and the way it was run again not not a critique of the boots on the ground and the troops that fought but a critique of those back in DC that were running it.

794
00:52:09.64 --> 00:52:19.64
And you know this is just this is just an incredible statement that a war of attrition is in essence the absence of strategy.

795
00:52:19.64 --> 00:52:24.64
This is like okay what do you do we're new it's gonna go kill as many of us and we can.

796
00:52:24.64 --> 00:52:31.64
Okay that's if that's your strategy not a strategy it's like when you get near an MMA fight what your strategy the guy goes.

797
00:52:31.64 --> 00:52:42.64
I'm gonna punch him in the face until I win right that's not a strategy put my head down and start to find a good strategy don't don't do that you need to have a little bit more strategy than that.

798
00:52:42.64 --> 00:52:45.64
Yeah.

799
00:52:45.64 --> 00:52:59.64
Back to the article if we're not stupid and we don't quit we can win this thing and again what's important is 2006 this this major McCoffland McCoffland he's another person that's interviewed in this article.

800
00:52:59.64 --> 00:53:10.64
He's talking about like we could lose this thing right so if we're not stupid and we don't quit we can win this thing major major McCoffland said history teaches you that war.

801
00:53:10.64 --> 00:53:28.64
At its heart is a human endeavor and if you ignore the human side yours the enemies and the civilians you set yourself up for failure it's not about weapons it's about people.

802
00:53:28.64 --> 00:53:48.64
That's very it's very true and I'll tell you where it's true it's true in war clearly and it's true in business too and you get people that don't understand the human side of business.

803
00:53:48.64 --> 00:53:59.64
They don't understand that they're dealing with human beings and they treat people like numbers they're not going to be successful now.

804
00:53:59.64 --> 00:54:08.64
You also get people that goes so far in in the other direction that all they care about is their people and guess what now they're making bad business decisions and they're hiring more people and they're keeping them they're not letting anyone go and they're running themselves in the ground because they're overhead too much and they cause destruction.

805
00:54:08.64 --> 00:54:22.64
On the other side you've got someone that's a up now being counter right no you let that person go no severance or whatever limit you do that methodology you're going to end up with no business either because they people because they're people.

806
00:54:22.64 --> 00:54:32.64
If you treat them like robots you're they're not going to work for you they're going to they're going to rebel against you the robot will do with the robot is told but people on robots.

807
00:54:32.64 --> 00:54:46.64
So you got to remember that human side and obviously in war and that's that's one of the reasons that we're able if we're able to talk about this stuff to businesses we're able to talk about combat leadership to businesses.

808
00:54:46.64 --> 00:55:09.64
The first often times the first thing that the business that's bringing us on has to get a grip on is the fact that. We were in charge of people not terminator robots right we laughing I use that term all time the people think oh you're in the military you run a Navy seals they do whatever you know no not true there people.

809
00:55:09.64 --> 00:55:24.64
And guess what the enemy are people they have thoughts they have passions they have desires and guess what the civilian populace that you're working amongst those are human beings too.

810
00:55:24.64 --> 00:55:39.64
And they're not just going to listen to what you say and you can't just for instance can't just throw money out right you can't just throw money out of they don't care about that money.

811
00:55:39.64 --> 00:55:52.64
News of a guy going into he was a I don't remember the reporters name but he's a young reporter spoke Arabic and he goes into Ramadi while it was surrounded by ISIS.

812
00:55:52.64 --> 00:56:10.64
And he's talking to just normal people and he's talking to this one guy and he says you know the guy saying look we really need help we hope America comes back.

813
00:56:10.64 --> 00:56:25.64
I live here I'm not going anywhere that's a human right that's a human that's a sentimental value it's like my house that I live in you're not going to take my house for me like if you if people came to try and take my house away from me.

814
00:56:25.64 --> 00:56:41.64
There'd be a fight and it wouldn't end well for anybody that's sentimental right so you have to remember that these human beings are human beings and that's that one of the key things that.

815
00:56:41.64 --> 00:57:04.64
And that McMaster really McMaster really understood really understood this fact and and you know I'm giving a lot of credit to McMaster but there's a lot I mean there's way more guys that I'm talking about than I don't have them not going through their names but there's a lot of guys that contributed to this idea and didn't outstanding job.

816
00:57:04.64 --> 00:57:23.64
He's getting the credit because he's got in charge right I'm giving him some credit because he's the guy in charge but I guarantee if you asked him he'd say well no I had this happened to this and I had this major that did that and he had all these people but he's the guy just like if something's gone wrong he'd be responsible some stuff went right so you get the credit there general.

817
00:57:23.64 --> 00:57:34.64
Now he wrote these. These four fallacies of warfare which I find very very interesting.

818
00:57:34.64 --> 00:57:41.64
And so we learned kind of the tactical side of what he learned from his battle 73 things.

819
00:57:41.64 --> 00:57:53.64
You know he had 10 lessons learned pretty tactical stuff right now we're getting into a little bit more strategic level or talking about.

820
00:57:53.64 --> 00:58:21.64
And so here's what he says about these four fallacies of war warfare there are four fallacies about future war that are preventing us from learning from our most recent experiences McMaster said.

821
00:58:21.64 --> 00:58:25.64
In the nature of war.

822
00:58:25.64 --> 00:58:33.64
Okay so he's saying look the way they portray these things is it makes everything good for America but they actually make things worse for America.

823
00:58:33.64 --> 00:58:39.64
Because they ignore things in war that are always the same.

824
00:58:39.64 --> 00:58:44.64
This is war we're talking about the nature of war does not change.

825
00:58:44.64 --> 00:58:57.64
This first fallacy the vampire fallacy. It's a vampire fallacy. It's a vampire because you can't kill it and it comes back every 10 years.

826
00:58:57.64 --> 00:59:07.64
This is the belief that a narrow range of technological capabilities will deliver fast, cheap and efficient victory in future war.

827
00:59:07.64 --> 00:59:19.64
The latest manifestation is the belief in a new range of technological capabilities everything from big data analytics to artificial intelligence to drones and robotics and so forth.

828
00:59:19.64 --> 00:59:34.64
So so what does that mean we have an idea that we can as a nation just we were so so technologically advanced that nothing can stand up to us and we can just use these precision weapons to take out enemy targets.

829
00:59:34.64 --> 00:59:43.64
And then it's over. It's a fallacy it's a vampire it's going to come back you can't just kill it it's going to come back.

830
00:59:43.64 --> 00:59:59.64
And you know obviously we've seen we saw that in Iraq we had all kinds of technological advances over the enemy but they continue to come back and when we walked away they came back strong they were called ISIS.

831
00:59:59.64 --> 01:00:08.64
Now I think that's pretty self evident what that means now what does this mean in business and in life well to me.

832
01:00:08.64 --> 01:00:21.64
What this means is there's no easy solution there's no easy solution to things right we look at something we go oh we can just do this.

833
01:00:21.64 --> 01:00:35.64
We can just use some certain new technology or we can just use some app right oh if I get an app to track my diet then I'll be good to go no.

834
01:00:35.64 --> 01:00:56.64
Got to stop putting the sugar in your mouth to be good to go. People want the shortcut. They want to they think that there's an easy way to get things done and there's not you have to do the work there's a vampire out there.

835
01:00:56.64 --> 01:01:10.64
What you got to do is you got to grab that vampire you got to cut it's head off you got to soak it in holy water and then you got to dry it's bones out in the sun that's what kills a vampire all right.

836
01:01:10.64 --> 01:01:23.64
That's the attitude you have to take you can't just think there's going to be a shortcut will be able to lead through this vampire you know tomorrow because I have a cool gun I'm going to shoot him no bullets don't kill him.

837
01:01:23.64 --> 01:01:36.64
You got to go harder. Yeah I think the correct way to kill a vampire isn't to cut his head off it's the wooden steak into a heart that's I think you might be thinking of my do so or something.

838
01:01:36.64 --> 01:01:45.64
Okay just kind of FYI but holy water part was correct though yeah just just so FYI I don't mean to call you out here.

839
01:01:45.64 --> 01:01:59.64
Actually googled how to kill a vampire. That's wrong though mythologies says otherwise he stick a wooden steak in his heart. Crucifix will get him if you have faith sunlight will kill him so that was correct.

840
01:01:59.64 --> 01:02:08.64
Holy water holy water will get a vermitor yeah and yeah and yeah I don't know what website said cut his head off.

841
01:02:08.64 --> 01:02:17.64
Oh don't trust Google less and learn to see you know what I did right there took a shortcut. Oh yeah I took I thought it was a vampire just googled real quick. Right go.

842
01:02:17.64 --> 01:02:24.64
You know what you did this is what this is my what I think you did I think you googled it which is fine, but here's the thing about googling something googling is not the answer.

843
01:02:24.64 --> 01:02:37.64
It's what you find from Google and if you just go for the first one or the one that looks like you see the iron here. I tried to take a shortcut and I'm wrong and that's the same. That's the vampire fallacy in it.

844
01:02:37.64 --> 01:02:39.64
In right. Yeah.

845
01:02:39.64 --> 01:02:40.64
Yeah.

846
01:02:40.64 --> 01:02:52.64
All right next. The zero dark 30 fallacy. That's the name of a movie about the the killing of bin Laden.

847
01:02:52.64 --> 01:03:09.64
This is the idea the zero dark 30 fallacy. This is the idea that all you have to gain to do to gain a victory in war is to gain visibility of an enemy's network structure and then conduct raids against that network.

848
01:03:09.64 --> 01:03:22.64
And then you can see that there are special operations forces or nodes. So the problem with both these fallacies. Of course they represent important capabilities you need to have.

849
01:03:22.64 --> 01:03:38.64
But these are capabilities that mask a raid as strategies and simple solutions to the complex problem of war neglecting wars political nature neglecting wars human nature neglecting wars inherent uncertainty based on the interactive nature.

850
01:03:38.64 --> 01:03:49.64
And finally neglecting that it is ultimately a contest of wills.

851
01:03:49.64 --> 01:04:00.64
So the idea that you can again it's a traditional warfare and I I'll be honest with you. I never really looked at this as a tradition warfare until I was reading research and for this podcast.

852
01:04:00.64 --> 01:04:18.64
I never I always said hey, you know, it's a raid mentality. Hey, we can just capture all the bad guys, but to say yes, that's a tradition warfare. That's exactly what it is. And especially for me because I look at World War one as so awful and it's an example of a traditional warfare and that's what makes it so bad.

853
01:04:18.64 --> 01:04:31.64
This is a tradition warfare to hey, we're just going to capture kill all the bad guys. How do you do that? What we're forgetting is what what about this line when you do that when you just say, look all we need to do is capture kill the bad guys. This is what you do.

854
01:04:31.64 --> 01:04:46.64
You mask a raid this that capability to be able to do that, which is an awesome capability, awesome capability, but that mask that capability mask a raids as a strategy and what you listen to things that you forget about this list is classic.

855
01:04:46.64 --> 01:05:02.64
The complex problem for you neglect war's political nature human nature inherent uncertainty interactive nature and you neglect that's a contest of wheels. So.

856
01:05:02.64 --> 01:05:18.64
And there's some great YouTube videos where McMaster's talking about that big lesson learning that this raid mentality was it's part of it's part of the way you defeat an uncertainty. Part of the way you defeat an uncertainty is.

857
01:05:18.64 --> 01:05:32.64
Capture kill in the bad guys. Awesome. But there's so much more you have to address that's like saying hey the way you win a GJ2 is the arm lock the person you can even say as broad as the way you win a GJ2 is to submit somebody.

858
01:05:32.64 --> 01:05:53.64
Right. So if I taught you every submission I knew, but I didn't teach you how to transition to GJ2 positions you would there's no way you could win. It's the same thing is submission important. Yes, that's what a raid is a raid is the submission. It's one piece of it. It's not the whole game though. It's not the whole game.

859
01:05:53.64 --> 01:06:06.64
And I think that's what he's making very clear here through that zero dark 30 fallacy. Next one is the wild kingdom fallacy.

860
01:06:06.64 --> 01:06:20.64
Back when America was wholesome there was no reality TV, no Kardashians or anything. So on Sunday nights American families would watch this wildlife show called mutual of Omaha's wild kingdom.

861
01:06:20.64 --> 01:06:33.64
And that show what happened on that show is the host Marlon Perkins would send his assistant Jim to conduct exotic and occasionally dangerous fieldwork.

862
01:06:33.64 --> 01:06:58.64
This is the belief that we could be like Marlon and just get Jim or other militaries to do our fighting for us. And this is a way in the minds of some people to reduce risk. But it actually increases risks because you were relying on other people whose interests are oftentimes in congruent with your own interests.

863
01:06:58.64 --> 01:07:09.64
And not only don't have the capability to fight and do what you need to do, but oftentimes don't have the will to do it.

864
01:07:09.64 --> 01:07:19.64
So he's saying this idea that we can just hey we'll just have the Iraqis do it sounds like a good idea right because I don't want my guys to get her killed there's a problem with that.

865
01:07:19.64 --> 01:07:30.64
The problem is they can't do what we do they can't do it as well as we do it and they probably don't have the will to do it now credit to their acus right now they're moving through Missouil.

866
01:07:30.64 --> 01:07:36.64
They're getting after it they're heavily backed by American forces, but they're they're taking the lead for sure.

867
01:07:36.64 --> 01:07:52.64
So but when we were in Ramadi, those guys didn't have the will that we had they didn't mean as much to them if you can believe that I know it sounds crazy. We had a battalion of Iraqi soldiers talking about this with life. We had a battalion of Iraqi soldiers.

868
01:07:52.64 --> 01:08:08.64
So 500 Iraqi soldiers that it come to Ramadi as to to help out in the fight they left they abandoned they quit a battalion of Iraqi soldiers and here's the weird thing.

869
01:08:08.64 --> 01:08:27.64
The reason they brought this battalion in one we needed more manpower number two they were Sunni so Ramadi was a Sunni city and bulk of the army at the time with Shia. So the she is coming in and fighting in Ramadi sometimes the Sunni's would say hey what is that and why these she isn't here.

870
01:08:27.64 --> 01:08:41.64
So the idea was to bring the Sunni's in to help and the Sunni's got scared the Sunni battalion got scared and left and one of the reasons they said well it's in a Sunni city.

871
01:08:41.64 --> 01:08:59.64
I just said wait wait a second. Wow that's the whole point these are your people these are other Sunni's that are getting murdered by insurgents. So it was just it was a tough situation and my point in saying that and there's a whole there's a whole.

872
01:08:59.64 --> 01:09:19.64
Another discussion we could have on that but the point is that. In order to win that fight we had to be on the ground the Iraqis were not going to do it by themselves they were not going to and that's what this fallacy is hey that if we just direct other people to do it.

873
01:09:19.64 --> 01:09:34.64
Then we'll be good to go and we don't have to take any risk now again how does that translate to what we do you know business how does that translate to business how does that translate to life for me it's real simple.

874
01:09:34.64 --> 01:09:56.64
The important thing that you got to do you got to do the hard things that you got to do you got to do you know it okay Tim Ferriss can we outsource some stuff yes we can don't worry Tim will outsource some stuff but the important stuff you have to do you got to do it.

875
01:09:56.64 --> 01:10:06.64
You got to do it yourself if it really means something you have to do it you have to have the will and you have to make it happen because if I outsource something to somebody.

876
01:10:06.64 --> 01:10:13.64
If I say hey I really don't feel like reading this book you know I don't feel like reading this book for the podcast can you read this for me.

877
01:10:13.64 --> 01:10:27.64
Well yeah somebody's going to read it but they're not going to have my perspective on it and they're just going to give me some notes I'm going to sit here and read them.

878
01:10:27.64 --> 01:10:40.64
We're not going to get the product that we need because that's important.

879
01:10:40.64 --> 01:10:43.64
I'm not sure that stuff echo Charles.

880
01:10:43.64 --> 01:10:57.64
No keep it in house for sure the the congruency of interest you know that's the big one because you can even think that the person has the same interest and really you both can think that but just maybe in a different way.

881
01:10:57.64 --> 01:11:10.64
I think you can create a like how you present this and what parts you think are important right are going to be slightly different even if the person is the same interest is there it's going to be different.

882
01:11:10.64 --> 01:11:25.64
Yeah you know I just somebody just wrote because we're doing mousse sashi it's a giant book and someone's highlight massage the other day and kind of took a picture of it and he said you know I wonder how close.

883
01:11:25.64 --> 01:11:38.64
I'm going to be right on maybe but they might not be yeah and I can't say hey bro send me your book and your notes and then we'll do the podcast and I'm just going to cheat can't do that just like you can't say hey you know what.

884
01:11:38.64 --> 01:11:58.20
County of them who ever want to come back on stuff she just goes ontime being a missing and so r fact on your hand it won't go back on all of the workups because I'm currently doing it without first play games and just they're going right you're sure theяла bag before the

885
01:11:43.72 --> 01:11:41.68
account and ready for you and then a ho goofy stuffign

886
01:11:44.68 --> 01:12:02.82
now today have me

887
01:12:02.82 --> 01:12:06.86
They thought, man, they lived under Saddam.

888
01:12:06.86 --> 01:12:10.50
For their whole lives, I mean, all the soldiers that we worked with lived under Saddam, their

889
01:12:10.50 --> 01:12:13.38
whole lives, that's all they knew.

890
01:12:13.38 --> 01:12:15.58
So for them, we say, no, you're going to have freedom.

891
01:12:15.58 --> 01:12:18.06
They're like, oh, yeah, no, what does that even mean?

892
01:12:18.06 --> 01:12:19.06
What does that mean?

893
01:12:19.06 --> 01:12:20.06
I don't know what that means.

894
01:12:20.06 --> 01:12:22.34
We're thinking, hey, don't worry.

895
01:12:22.34 --> 01:12:23.82
These guys are fighting for their freedom.

896
01:12:23.82 --> 01:12:24.98
They're going to fight for their SUNY brothers.

897
01:12:24.98 --> 01:12:26.42
They're going to fight for their Iraq.

898
01:12:26.42 --> 01:12:27.54
They're kind of like, we don't even know.

899
01:12:27.54 --> 01:12:31.14
They didn't even really have a good vision of what Iraq is.

900
01:12:31.14 --> 01:12:34.42
Iraq is a country that we used to be underneath Saddam.

901
01:12:34.42 --> 01:12:35.42
And now it's not.

902
01:12:35.42 --> 01:12:36.42
And we don't know what that means.

903
01:12:36.42 --> 01:12:37.62
We don't know what that looks like.

904
01:12:37.62 --> 01:12:39.94
We Americans had a vision of what that looked like.

905
01:12:39.94 --> 01:12:40.94
They didn't have it.

906
01:12:40.94 --> 01:12:43.18
So how are they going to fight for it?

907
01:12:43.18 --> 01:12:45.70
To your point, they don't see what we see.

908
01:12:45.70 --> 01:12:47.46
They have a different opinion.

909
01:12:47.46 --> 01:12:54.10
So who's got to go on there and who's going to have the will to fight, answer us in that

910
01:12:54.10 --> 01:12:55.70
particular case.

911
01:12:55.70 --> 01:12:59.98
And it's the same thing right now, even in Missouri, even in the last time when Ramadi

912
01:12:59.98 --> 01:13:07.18
was taken back by the Iraqi forces, good on them, props to the Iraqi forces right now.

913
01:13:07.18 --> 01:13:08.74
They're backed up by Americans.

914
01:13:08.74 --> 01:13:11.18
Americans are saying, hey, look, this is the vision.

915
01:13:11.18 --> 01:13:12.18
This is what you're going to do.

916
01:13:12.18 --> 01:13:14.22
This is how we're going to take this part of it.

917
01:13:14.22 --> 01:13:17.94
And that is the big difference of why they didn't have the will.

918
01:13:17.94 --> 01:13:20.94
They didn't understand what they were fighting for.

919
01:13:20.94 --> 01:13:22.74
And you take anybody and put them in that story.

920
01:13:22.74 --> 01:13:24.86
And I don't even look at Vietnam War.

921
01:13:24.86 --> 01:13:26.90
You could have Vietnam War.

922
01:13:26.90 --> 01:13:31.86
So our American soldiers, some of them, you can go watch interviews.

923
01:13:31.86 --> 01:13:33.90
They were saying, I don't know what I'm fighting for.

924
01:13:33.90 --> 01:13:39.26
Hey, they were actually questioned, I don't know what America is like anymore, right?

925
01:13:39.26 --> 01:13:47.86
Which really read in this book by Jim Thompson, longest held POW ever.

926
01:13:47.86 --> 01:13:52.34
And when he got back, he was kind of, when he got back to America, he was gone from 1964

927
01:13:52.34 --> 01:13:56.10
until 1973.

928
01:13:56.10 --> 01:14:03.14
When he got back, when he left, America was fairly conservative in patriotic.

929
01:14:03.14 --> 01:14:06.06
When he gets back, people are burning flags, people are protesting.

930
01:14:06.06 --> 01:14:08.86
He was taken a back by it.

931
01:14:08.86 --> 01:14:14.90
And so if you took somebody that left for Vietnam in 1970, and America's in turmoil

932
01:14:14.90 --> 01:14:21.70
and all that, it's hard to have the same vision that they had had in 1964, which is,

933
01:14:21.70 --> 01:14:24.02
hey, America, we're going to go stop the communist.

934
01:14:24.02 --> 01:14:25.62
Communist or bad.

935
01:14:25.62 --> 01:14:27.34
I mean, it's our bad.

936
01:14:27.34 --> 01:14:30.38
But then you start having the American socialist party that telling you that communist

937
01:14:30.38 --> 01:14:33.42
are good and all the sudden kids over there going, hey, look, I don't even know what's

938
01:14:33.42 --> 01:14:34.42
going on.

939
01:14:34.42 --> 01:14:36.74
But I'm not sure I want to die here in this jungle.

940
01:14:36.74 --> 01:14:37.74
And that's problematic.

941
01:14:37.74 --> 01:14:40.90
And it's the same thing with the Iraqi soldiers.

942
01:14:40.90 --> 01:14:42.58
They just didn't know what they were fighting for.

943
01:14:42.58 --> 01:14:46.58
If you asked them what they were fighting for, they might say a paycheck.

944
01:14:46.58 --> 01:14:51.42
Very few of them would say I'm fighting for a free and stable Iraq.

945
01:14:51.42 --> 01:14:52.42
Yeah.

946
01:14:52.42 --> 01:14:53.42
Very few of them.

947
01:14:53.42 --> 01:14:58.22
Some of them fought against truly heartfelt against the insurgents.

948
01:14:58.22 --> 01:14:59.90
They didn't like the insurgents.

949
01:14:59.90 --> 01:15:04.66
The insurgents were murdering people and raping women and torturing people.

950
01:15:04.66 --> 01:15:05.66
They didn't like that.

951
01:15:05.66 --> 01:15:07.14
They'd fight hard against them.

952
01:15:07.14 --> 01:15:09.82
But that wasn't not everyone experienced that.

953
01:15:09.82 --> 01:15:11.54
Not everyone saw that.

954
01:15:11.54 --> 01:15:12.54
Yeah.

955
01:15:12.54 --> 01:15:17.18
So, and I'm sure they're kind of like, you can tell them what you're fighting for.

956
01:15:17.18 --> 01:15:19.54
And they can answer you for sure.

957
01:15:19.54 --> 01:15:20.54
Yeah.

958
01:15:20.54 --> 01:15:24.02
It's like, you're dad tells you when you're young.

959
01:15:24.02 --> 01:15:25.58
You're dad tells you, hey, clean your room.

960
01:15:25.58 --> 01:15:27.18
I want this room to spit and span.

961
01:15:27.18 --> 01:15:28.66
Yeah, you don't get it.

962
01:15:28.66 --> 01:15:31.02
Yeah, I'm going to take this whole mess.

963
01:15:31.02 --> 01:15:32.66
I'm just going to put in the closet.

964
01:15:32.66 --> 01:15:35.26
Just so he'll leave me alone kind of thing.

965
01:15:35.26 --> 01:15:39.86
And then meanwhile, the dad, your dad, has his vision.

966
01:15:39.86 --> 01:15:41.54
It's like, what's up with you?

967
01:15:41.54 --> 01:15:42.54
Why don't you clean your room?

968
01:15:42.54 --> 01:15:44.26
Don't you understand kind of thing?

969
01:15:44.26 --> 01:15:45.26
Yep.

970
01:15:45.26 --> 01:15:46.26
No, you don't.

971
01:15:46.26 --> 01:15:50.30
You don't understand that your dad's trying to teach you the discipline equals freedom.

972
01:15:50.30 --> 01:15:52.54
So, I kids were running late this morning.

973
01:15:52.54 --> 01:15:53.94
Going to school.

974
01:15:53.94 --> 01:15:54.74
Why are they running late?

975
01:15:54.74 --> 01:15:56.74
Because their rooms are messy.

976
01:15:56.74 --> 01:15:58.98
Well, you're running late.

977
01:15:58.98 --> 01:16:00.82
Everything's stressful now when we're heading to school.

978
01:16:00.82 --> 01:16:01.82
Why is that?

979
01:16:01.82 --> 01:16:03.42
Well, because your room is messy.

980
01:16:03.42 --> 01:16:05.18
Lack of discipline.

981
01:16:05.18 --> 01:16:07.58
Lack of discipline causes mental stress.

982
01:16:07.58 --> 01:16:09.54
Mental stress is not freedom.

983
01:16:09.54 --> 01:16:10.54
Yeah.

984
01:16:10.54 --> 01:16:14.90
But to your point, even trying to explain to the Iraqi soldiers why they're doing what they're

985
01:16:14.90 --> 01:16:19.42
doing on a really big level like that is difficult.

986
01:16:19.42 --> 01:16:20.98
Now, occasionally, you get a good leader.

987
01:16:20.98 --> 01:16:22.62
There was some good host and good leaders.

988
01:16:22.62 --> 01:16:27.26
There was one of the generals that the Delta Patuon commander worked with.

989
01:16:27.26 --> 01:16:28.66
He was a good dude.

990
01:16:28.66 --> 01:16:30.54
He was a good leader.

991
01:16:30.54 --> 01:16:34.54
And the Delta Patuon commander actually had some really good Iraqi scouts as well.

992
01:16:34.54 --> 01:16:36.82
That really believed in what they were doing.

993
01:16:36.82 --> 01:16:40.78
And I know that the reason I'd get for entry to the Delta Patuon commander worked very

994
01:16:40.78 --> 01:16:42.94
consistently with the same guys, a bunch.

995
01:16:42.94 --> 01:16:46.78
As life was working with multiple different groups.

996
01:16:46.78 --> 01:16:52.30
So the Delta Patuon commander had some more tight relationships with some of those guys.

997
01:16:52.30 --> 01:16:53.70
They've did too.

998
01:16:53.70 --> 01:16:58.18
But anyways, some of those guys understood what they were fighting for.

999
01:16:58.18 --> 01:17:03.58
But it's hard to just like you said, explain what freedom is.

1000
01:17:03.58 --> 01:17:09.10
And the other piece of it is in those situations, explaining what freedom is is still

1001
01:17:09.10 --> 01:17:11.42
no guarantee at all.

1002
01:17:11.42 --> 01:17:13.02
That freedom is coming your way.

1003
01:17:13.02 --> 01:17:15.06
These guys have been through so much turmoil.

1004
01:17:15.06 --> 01:17:16.62
That country's been through so much turmoil.

1005
01:17:16.62 --> 01:17:17.82
They're like, hey, you know what?

1006
01:17:17.82 --> 01:17:18.90
We don't even know.

1007
01:17:18.90 --> 01:17:20.94
You can promise us that.

1008
01:17:20.94 --> 01:17:22.94
But doesn't seem like we're doing too well.

1009
01:17:22.94 --> 01:17:24.02
How do we know you're going to win?

1010
01:17:24.02 --> 01:17:25.50
How do we know we're going to win?

1011
01:17:25.50 --> 01:17:26.50
We don't know that.

1012
01:17:26.50 --> 01:17:27.50
So you know what I'm going to do?

1013
01:17:27.50 --> 01:17:28.50
Lay low.

1014
01:17:28.50 --> 01:17:30.42
See where this thing falls.

1015
01:17:30.42 --> 01:17:31.66
And then I'll step up.

1016
01:17:31.66 --> 01:17:38.10
Once I know who's going to win, tough.

1017
01:17:38.10 --> 01:17:42.02
Next, the RSVP fallacy.

1018
01:17:42.02 --> 01:17:46.26
Thank you for the kind invitation to the war, but the United States regrets it

1019
01:17:46.26 --> 01:17:48.66
is unable to attend.

1020
01:17:48.66 --> 01:17:51.78
This is the belief that you can just opt out of war.

1021
01:17:51.78 --> 01:17:59.58
It's a narcissistic approach to war, which we define only war in relation to us and what

1022
01:17:59.58 --> 01:18:03.74
we'd like to do.

1023
01:18:03.74 --> 01:18:08.70
So this idea that you can just be opt out doesn't work.

1024
01:18:08.70 --> 01:18:13.82
The bottom line there is that you got to get in the game.

1025
01:18:13.82 --> 01:18:15.46
The game is going to take place.

1026
01:18:15.46 --> 01:18:17.02
The game is going to happen.

1027
01:18:17.02 --> 01:18:18.06
And you're going to be affected by it.

1028
01:18:18.06 --> 01:18:19.38
That's the key point.

1029
01:18:19.38 --> 01:18:21.82
It's not a game that takes place on a field.

1030
01:18:21.82 --> 01:18:26.86
It's a game that takes place on a field and expands out into the crowd, into the stands,

1031
01:18:26.86 --> 01:18:33.06
into the town, and stuff starts getting burned and riots take place.

1032
01:18:33.06 --> 01:18:40.38
So you have to get in the game.

1033
01:18:40.38 --> 01:18:44.58
That was the fourth fallacy of war now.

1034
01:18:44.58 --> 01:18:53.94
I think that all those really show not just how smart McMaster is, but also how open-minded

1035
01:18:53.94 --> 01:18:56.46
he is, which is a very important quality.

1036
01:18:56.46 --> 01:18:59.54
I also think he's a realist.

1037
01:18:59.54 --> 01:19:04.90
He's a realist and looks at things in a very real way.

1038
01:19:04.90 --> 01:19:07.58
This is what's happening and this is what we need to do with it.

1039
01:19:07.58 --> 01:19:13.30
And also what's great about McMaster is that he's not afraid to speak his mind.

1040
01:19:13.30 --> 01:19:16.74
And he's got trouble for that along the way.

1041
01:19:16.74 --> 01:19:28.42
So I'm definitely looking forward to seeing how McMaster handles all the challenges that

1042
01:19:28.42 --> 01:19:35.90
are ahead of him right now, not only in DC, but in the world.

1043
01:19:35.90 --> 01:19:41.10
So it's going to be an interesting and we wish him, or I certainly wish him, the best

1044
01:19:41.10 --> 01:19:46.74
of luck in that pursuit.

1045
01:19:46.74 --> 01:19:48.54
So lead off with the little McMaster.

1046
01:19:48.54 --> 01:19:52.26
And think about going to a little Q&A at this time.

1047
01:19:52.26 --> 01:19:53.26
Sure.

1048
01:19:53.26 --> 01:19:56.18
It's been a little while since we did Q&A here.

1049
01:19:56.18 --> 01:19:57.42
Yeah.

1050
01:19:57.42 --> 01:19:59.42
I've been doing Facebook Live.

1051
01:19:59.42 --> 01:20:00.42
Yeah.

1052
01:20:00.42 --> 01:20:08.70
And when I've been doing Facebook Live, I'm purposely not preparing at all.

1053
01:20:08.70 --> 01:20:10.02
That's my goal.

1054
01:20:10.02 --> 01:20:12.38
My goal is to not prepare at all.

1055
01:20:12.38 --> 01:20:19.46
Because the second one that I did, I started looking at the questions ahead of time.

1056
01:20:19.46 --> 01:20:21.46
And I was saying, OK, well, may I just take a couple notes here?

1057
01:20:21.46 --> 01:20:24.34
And all of a sudden I started preparing for Facebook Live.

1058
01:20:24.34 --> 01:20:27.38
And then I realized, if I'm going to prepare, I'll make it the podcast.

1059
01:20:27.38 --> 01:20:30.10
So no, don't prepare.

1060
01:20:30.10 --> 01:20:34.58
Facebook Live, ask me your question, and I'll answer it there on the spot.

1061
01:20:34.58 --> 01:20:36.62
It's fun.

1062
01:20:36.62 --> 01:20:38.82
It's different, right?

1063
01:20:38.82 --> 01:20:40.78
It's easier.

1064
01:20:40.78 --> 01:20:46.58
I can't do two podcasts a week because don't have time to prepare for them.

1065
01:20:46.58 --> 01:20:47.90
But can you Facebook Live?

1066
01:20:47.90 --> 01:20:49.70
You can slide that thing in.

1067
01:20:49.70 --> 01:20:56.30
It doesn't prepare for a live thing with the dynamics of Facebook Live.

1068
01:20:56.30 --> 01:20:58.54
It doesn't let defeat the live kind of purpose.

1069
01:20:58.54 --> 01:21:00.38
In a way, it does.

1070
01:21:00.38 --> 01:21:03.94
But we could do this podcast on Facebook Live.

1071
01:21:03.94 --> 01:21:04.94
So we could prepare it.

1072
01:21:04.94 --> 01:21:06.46
And we could put it on Facebook Live.

1073
01:21:06.46 --> 01:21:08.34
We could do that.

1074
01:21:08.34 --> 01:21:11.38
But then it would be a rehash of what we're doing.

1075
01:21:11.38 --> 01:21:21.58
And the other piece of it is, I think the Facebook Live is a way of people seeing a little

1076
01:21:21.58 --> 01:21:24.94
bit more of me as a normal human being.

1077
01:21:24.94 --> 01:21:30.94
And not me as a guy with all the answers on stuff like, no, you asked me a question.

1078
01:21:30.94 --> 01:21:33.26
I don't really know what you know what I mean.

1079
01:21:33.26 --> 01:21:39.34
And also, obviously on this podcast is usually pretty serious.

1080
01:21:39.34 --> 01:21:42.86
And so I'm not like that all the time.

1081
01:21:42.86 --> 01:21:44.26
So maybe they could see.

1082
01:21:44.26 --> 01:21:46.62
Well, I have a serious side, no doubt.

1083
01:21:46.62 --> 01:21:47.62
Sure.

1084
01:21:47.62 --> 01:21:50.26
But I'm not like that all the time.

1085
01:21:50.26 --> 01:21:54.06
So I think Facebook Live is a good way to say.

1086
01:21:54.06 --> 01:21:59.78
Plus, I don't want to answer some questions here for a couple of reasons.

1087
01:21:59.78 --> 01:22:03.86
Number one, man, when somebody listens to the podcast, I want to make sure they're getting

1088
01:22:03.86 --> 01:22:06.94
something of high quality, right?

1089
01:22:06.94 --> 01:22:09.06
Not just some fluff, right?

1090
01:22:09.06 --> 01:22:10.86
We're not doing fluff here.

1091
01:22:10.86 --> 01:22:14.22
If we need to do fluff on the podcast, we just want to do the podcast.

1092
01:22:14.22 --> 01:22:18.38
Because I don't want to, somebody to press play in waste time.

1093
01:22:18.38 --> 01:22:19.38
Oh, yeah.

1094
01:22:19.38 --> 01:22:20.38
You know what I mean?

1095
01:22:20.38 --> 01:22:27.34
Now my fluffing around and talking smack on Facebook Live because that's what it is.

1096
01:22:27.34 --> 01:22:28.82
It's an open forum.

1097
01:22:28.82 --> 01:22:30.46
We're going to have some fun.

1098
01:22:30.46 --> 01:22:32.90
We're going to get after it a little bit.

1099
01:22:32.90 --> 01:22:36.78
But it's not going to be super heavy because if you want that, come here.

1100
01:22:36.78 --> 01:22:38.10
Get your podcast on.

1101
01:22:38.10 --> 01:22:41.82
You know, yes, kind of more lightened up a little bit.

1102
01:22:41.82 --> 01:22:46.98
Yeah, it's not like that's it is not like I said, okay.

1103
01:22:46.98 --> 01:22:47.98
Let's see.

1104
01:22:47.98 --> 01:22:48.98
I need to show them my light side.

1105
01:22:48.98 --> 01:22:49.98
No.

1106
01:22:49.98 --> 01:22:50.98
Five.

1107
01:22:50.98 --> 01:22:51.98
Right.

1108
01:22:51.98 --> 01:22:56.16
It's like when Jody came on, Jody came on, like after we were hanging out for like an

1109
01:22:56.16 --> 01:22:58.50
hour, he's like, yeah, man, we're not just coming down.

1110
01:22:58.50 --> 01:23:00.78
I just thought you were going to be like, full on cycle of all time.

1111
01:23:00.78 --> 01:23:03.14
I was like, yeah, I'm not full on cycle of all time.

1112
01:23:03.14 --> 01:23:06.86
You know, if we're eating a burger, we're good.

1113
01:23:06.86 --> 01:23:11.30
I'm not going to be sitting there while I'm eating a burger saying let me tell you what.

1114
01:23:11.30 --> 01:23:14.50
No, I didn't want to do that when I'm eating a burger.

1115
01:23:14.50 --> 01:23:15.50
Wouldn't enjoy that burger.

1116
01:23:15.50 --> 01:23:17.50
Yeah, make sense.

1117
01:23:17.50 --> 01:23:21.66
But yeah, if it's alive, Q&A, you know how like at like the mustard or you know, when

1118
01:23:21.66 --> 01:23:24.78
you guys, okay, we're going to do some Q&A.

1119
01:23:24.78 --> 01:23:26.58
That's the example of like a live Q&A.

1120
01:23:26.58 --> 01:23:28.10
You don't prepare for those questions.

1121
01:23:28.10 --> 01:23:29.10
No.

1122
01:23:29.10 --> 01:23:33.66
And also what's interesting about those questions is those I've given some, I mean, if you

1123
01:23:33.66 --> 01:23:40.98
think about any of the podcasts that I've gone on, Tim Ferriss, Joe Rogan, Sam Harris,

1124
01:23:40.98 --> 01:23:43.50
those, those guys asked me some heavy questions.

1125
01:23:43.50 --> 01:23:44.50
Right.

1126
01:23:44.50 --> 01:23:46.74
Those guys weren't just asking, we were just BSing.

1127
01:23:46.74 --> 01:23:47.98
Right, during those.

1128
01:23:47.98 --> 01:23:54.54
So there's no guarantee that I'm not going to get get a little bit serious on Facebook

1129
01:23:54.54 --> 01:23:55.54
or live or whatever.

1130
01:23:55.54 --> 01:23:57.34
I'm going to do what people ask me.

1131
01:23:57.34 --> 01:23:58.34
Right.

1132
01:23:58.34 --> 01:23:59.34
Yeah.

1133
01:23:59.34 --> 01:24:04.86
But yeah, during the mustard, we do a lot of Q&A during the mustard.

1134
01:24:04.86 --> 01:24:06.14
We get all kinds of questions.

1135
01:24:06.14 --> 01:24:09.94
There's some really funny questions that require funny responses.

1136
01:24:09.94 --> 01:24:14.70
There's also some some real serious ones that require very serious answers.

1137
01:24:14.70 --> 01:24:19.58
And what's interesting is this happens on Twitter, too?

1138
01:24:19.58 --> 01:24:24.50
Somebody asked me some dead serious question, like a very serious, you know, something

1139
01:24:24.50 --> 01:24:29.38
that's emotional to me like about losing guys or something like that.

1140
01:24:29.38 --> 01:24:32.14
Guys killed in combat and I'll respond to it.

1141
01:24:32.14 --> 01:24:37.30
And then two tweets later, someone says, you know, I'm going to have some mint chocolate

1142
01:24:37.30 --> 01:24:38.30
by his cream tonight.

1143
01:24:38.30 --> 01:24:40.82
You don't even mean into you go through these.

1144
01:24:40.82 --> 01:24:44.46
If someone's read, they must think I'm schizophrenic because I'm answer real serious.

1145
01:24:44.46 --> 01:24:46.74
It's real light and then it's just kind of weird.

1146
01:24:46.74 --> 01:24:48.70
Yeah, the roller coaster man.

1147
01:24:48.70 --> 01:24:49.70
Yeah.

1148
01:24:49.70 --> 01:24:51.70
It's an emotional roller coaster on the Twitter.

1149
01:24:51.70 --> 01:24:52.70
Oh, Lord.

1150
01:24:52.70 --> 01:24:53.70
All right.

1151
01:24:53.70 --> 01:24:54.70
So I'll Q&A.

1152
01:24:54.70 --> 01:24:55.70
Okay.

1153
01:24:55.70 --> 01:24:56.70
Echo Charles.

1154
01:24:56.70 --> 01:24:57.70
Back in the game.

1155
01:24:57.70 --> 01:24:58.70
All right.

1156
01:24:58.70 --> 01:24:59.70
So yeah, first question.

1157
01:24:59.70 --> 01:25:01.70
Jocco and echo.

1158
01:25:01.70 --> 01:25:05.14
Should you defend bad leaders?

1159
01:25:05.14 --> 01:25:07.02
Okay, your superiors.

1160
01:25:07.02 --> 01:25:08.38
To your men.

1161
01:25:08.38 --> 01:25:09.38
Think about it.

1162
01:25:09.38 --> 01:25:15.70
Think about that question.

1163
01:25:15.70 --> 01:25:17.54
This is a good.

1164
01:25:17.54 --> 01:25:19.26
It's a good question.

1165
01:25:19.26 --> 01:25:21.62
And we haven't done Q&A in a while.

1166
01:25:21.62 --> 01:25:22.62
That's why I want to start off.

1167
01:25:22.62 --> 01:25:23.62
Think about that.

1168
01:25:23.62 --> 01:25:25.78
Should you defend bad leaders?

1169
01:25:25.78 --> 01:25:26.78
That are people that are in charge.

1170
01:25:26.78 --> 01:25:29.62
You should defend them to your men.

1171
01:25:29.62 --> 01:25:36.42
Now this is really a perfect example of the dichotomy of leadership.

1172
01:25:36.42 --> 01:25:41.82
And this is one of those situations that makes leadership very, very hard because it requires

1173
01:25:41.82 --> 01:25:47.78
a nuanced balance to handle this correctly.

1174
01:25:47.78 --> 01:25:59.54
So on the one hand, if we say our boss is a bad leader and doesn't know what he's doing,

1175
01:25:59.54 --> 01:26:00.54
difficult to get all the boss.

1176
01:26:00.54 --> 01:26:02.22
Echo our boss doesn't know what he's doing.

1177
01:26:02.22 --> 01:26:04.14
He's an idiot.

1178
01:26:04.14 --> 01:26:06.10
We undermine his authority.

1179
01:26:06.10 --> 01:26:07.10
For sure.

1180
01:26:07.10 --> 01:26:10.54
And we undermine the authority of the whole chain of command.

1181
01:26:10.54 --> 01:26:15.22
So should you call out when someone sucks?

1182
01:26:15.22 --> 01:26:16.42
You say, oh, that guy sucks.

1183
01:26:16.42 --> 01:26:17.42
He's terrible.

1184
01:26:17.42 --> 01:26:19.02
Should you do that to your leader?

1185
01:26:19.02 --> 01:26:20.42
The answer is no.

1186
01:26:20.42 --> 01:26:21.62
You can't do that.

1187
01:26:21.62 --> 01:26:23.50
You can't do that because you're undermining everything.

1188
01:26:23.50 --> 01:26:25.14
So you got a horrible leader.

1189
01:26:25.14 --> 01:26:28.66
You can't just sit there to your boys and say, hey, this guy's an idiot.

1190
01:26:28.66 --> 01:26:31.10
You can't do that.

1191
01:26:31.10 --> 01:26:34.10
However.

1192
01:26:34.10 --> 01:26:44.86
If you give full support to this horrible boss, then your troops, who know a good leader

1193
01:26:44.86 --> 01:26:46.02
from a bad leader?

1194
01:26:46.02 --> 01:26:47.46
They know what's stupid and what isn't.

1195
01:26:47.46 --> 01:26:48.30
They know this.

1196
01:26:48.30 --> 01:26:49.70
They know this.

1197
01:26:49.70 --> 01:26:57.46
And if you are sitting there back into my 100% then they're going to know that you either

1198
01:26:57.46 --> 01:27:00.86
actually agree with the bad leader, which is bad.

1199
01:27:00.86 --> 01:27:07.90
Or that you're too weak to stand up and say, hey, boss, what we're doing is wrong.

1200
01:27:07.90 --> 01:27:09.98
So you can't go to one extreme.

1201
01:27:09.98 --> 01:27:11.10
The boss is an idiot.

1202
01:27:11.10 --> 01:27:12.74
You can't go to the other extreme.

1203
01:27:12.74 --> 01:27:13.74
The boss is awesome.

1204
01:27:13.74 --> 01:27:14.82
Think about how hard that is.

1205
01:27:14.82 --> 01:27:16.26
Think about what I'm saying.

1206
01:27:16.26 --> 01:27:18.18
This is a very, very challenging.

1207
01:27:18.18 --> 01:27:21.18
So what can you do?

1208
01:27:21.18 --> 01:27:27.06
Well, okay, first of all, as a subordinate leader, it is your duty to push back, right?

1209
01:27:27.06 --> 01:27:31.06
To say, hey, boss, I think we're doing the wrong thing here.

1210
01:27:31.06 --> 01:27:34.26
And this is why we spend a lot of time trying to build relationships with our bosses

1211
01:27:34.26 --> 01:27:37.14
so that we can have candid conversations with them, right?

1212
01:27:37.14 --> 01:27:39.82
Sometimes it's hard to do that.

1213
01:27:39.82 --> 01:27:43.22
It is, I understand.

1214
01:27:43.22 --> 01:27:51.86
But when you have built a relationship, then you can go to your boss and say, hey, look, this

1215
01:27:51.86 --> 01:27:53.50
is not good.

1216
01:27:53.50 --> 01:27:59.58
And now once you've done that, then you can go to your troops and you say, hey, look,

1217
01:27:59.58 --> 01:28:03.78
I went to the bosses when I told them, you know, I told them that, hey, doing this method

1218
01:28:03.78 --> 01:28:05.10
isn't going to work well.

1219
01:28:05.10 --> 01:28:06.38
He explained to me while we're doing it.

1220
01:28:06.38 --> 01:28:07.38
This is what he said.

1221
01:28:07.38 --> 01:28:08.70
So this is why we're using this method.

1222
01:28:08.70 --> 01:28:13.10
I know it's not popular to you guys, but here's the reason why we're doing it.

1223
01:28:13.10 --> 01:28:14.34
So you made progress, right?

1224
01:28:14.34 --> 01:28:17.02
Your guys were saying, okay, well, he at least stood up to the man.

1225
01:28:17.02 --> 01:28:18.62
And now he gave us an answer.

1226
01:28:18.62 --> 01:28:19.98
He told us why we're doing what we're doing.

1227
01:28:19.98 --> 01:28:22.46
So that's good too.

1228
01:28:22.46 --> 01:28:29.78
But the other thing is, when an easiest way to do this is to provide an honest, to

1229
01:28:29.78 --> 01:28:32.98
pin truth, truth is going to be your friend here.

1230
01:28:32.98 --> 01:28:33.98
Truth is going to be your friend.

1231
01:28:33.98 --> 01:28:37.34
Now I should, I should put a caveat around that.

1232
01:28:37.34 --> 01:28:41.30
Because the truth might be, you think your boss is a complete idiot and everything you

1233
01:28:41.30 --> 01:28:42.30
say in the stupid.

1234
01:28:42.30 --> 01:28:43.98
So I, I take it back.

1235
01:28:43.98 --> 01:28:45.50
No, use full on truth.

1236
01:28:45.50 --> 01:28:53.90
And then this is so, this is so interesting too because clearly truthfulness is a huge, you

1237
01:28:53.90 --> 01:28:58.18
know, it's a value that I've hold very dear, right?

1238
01:28:58.18 --> 01:29:00.74
And you got to be truthful and all that.

1239
01:29:00.74 --> 01:29:02.34
I'm telling you right now do not be true.

1240
01:29:02.34 --> 01:29:05.98
If you think your boss is an idiot and you think the method that he's picking or the

1241
01:29:05.98 --> 01:29:09.58
plan he's got is stupid, don't be truthful to your guys and go down there and say,

1242
01:29:09.58 --> 01:29:12.82
boss is an idiot, it's not going to help your team, right?

1243
01:29:12.82 --> 01:29:16.62
We have to be smart about what we're doing.

1244
01:29:16.62 --> 01:29:24.74
But when you do that, what you need to do is keep it somewhere in the middle.

1245
01:29:24.74 --> 01:29:25.74
Okay.

1246
01:29:25.74 --> 01:29:30.86
So, when you say something negative, don't get all crazy with the negative.

1247
01:29:30.86 --> 01:29:34.22
Don't get all nuts with the negative.

1248
01:29:34.22 --> 01:29:38.78
What you want to do is say, you say something like, hey, look, I'm sure there's some

1249
01:29:38.78 --> 01:29:42.54
better ways of doing this, but this is the decision that was made and we need to make

1250
01:29:42.54 --> 01:29:43.54
it work.

1251
01:29:43.54 --> 01:29:44.54
Right?

1252
01:29:44.54 --> 01:29:45.54
So, I'm not saying it's horrible.

1253
01:29:45.54 --> 01:29:47.90
I'm saying, look, hey, guys, I'm sure there's some better ways, but guess what?

1254
01:29:47.90 --> 01:29:51.70
This is what we are being told to do right now and we're going to do the best we can.

1255
01:29:51.70 --> 01:29:55.50
They'll just let them put in it from like them to the we making, I'm taking ownership

1256
01:29:55.50 --> 01:29:56.50
of it.

1257
01:29:56.50 --> 01:29:58.74
This is now ours to execute.

1258
01:29:58.74 --> 01:30:00.74
So you want to do that, or you.

1259
01:30:00.74 --> 01:30:06.94
And I also want to focus more on as much as I can.

1260
01:30:06.94 --> 01:30:12.22
I want to focus on not the personality of the boss, but I want to focus on the

1261
01:30:12.22 --> 01:30:14.98
level of what we're being told, type thing, or what the mission is.

1262
01:30:14.98 --> 01:30:18.22
Because I don't want to bring, I want to keep the personality of the boss at bay.

1263
01:30:18.22 --> 01:30:23.34
Sometimes you get a boss that has such a raging asshole personality that you have to say

1264
01:30:23.34 --> 01:30:24.34
something.

1265
01:30:24.34 --> 01:30:26.14
Like you just, you have to explain.

1266
01:30:26.14 --> 01:30:28.90
And that's when even then you want to ratchet it down a little bit.

1267
01:30:28.90 --> 01:30:30.66
You don't say hey, the boss's asshole.

1268
01:30:30.66 --> 01:30:31.66
Yeah.

1269
01:30:31.66 --> 01:30:32.66
The boss's an idiot.

1270
01:30:32.66 --> 01:30:33.66
No, you don't say that.

1271
01:30:33.66 --> 01:30:39.86
You know, you say, hey, look, guys, I know the boss is not exactly perfect, but I think

1272
01:30:39.86 --> 01:30:44.34
he means well, if what he's trying to do, and that way, we need to focus for that reason,

1273
01:30:44.34 --> 01:30:45.90
we need to focus on executing.

1274
01:30:45.90 --> 01:30:48.46
Because it's not going to help us to sit here and complain about the boss.

1275
01:30:48.46 --> 01:30:51.18
He might not have the greatest personality, but you know what?

1276
01:30:51.18 --> 01:30:52.42
His intention is good.

1277
01:30:52.42 --> 01:30:53.42
So let's support him.

1278
01:30:53.42 --> 01:30:54.42
You know what I mean?

1279
01:30:54.42 --> 01:30:59.42
Something like that where you're not, you're not giving him full support, but you're

1280
01:30:59.42 --> 01:31:01.62
not completely throwing him under the bus.

1281
01:31:01.62 --> 01:31:06.86
Again, this is so hard to do because let's face it.

1282
01:31:06.86 --> 01:31:10.58
The boys, the troops, they know what's up.

1283
01:31:10.58 --> 01:31:12.22
They know when that boss is an idiot.

1284
01:31:12.22 --> 01:31:13.50
They know when he's unprofessional.

1285
01:31:13.50 --> 01:31:15.62
They know when he treats you like shit.

1286
01:31:15.62 --> 01:31:17.78
They know that stuff.

1287
01:31:17.78 --> 01:31:21.86
And so if you bow down, if you break, and you give that to him, yes, you're right.

1288
01:31:21.86 --> 01:31:22.86
The boss is jerky.

1289
01:31:22.86 --> 01:31:23.86
Yes, you're right.

1290
01:31:23.86 --> 01:31:25.50
The boss treats people like shit.

1291
01:31:25.50 --> 01:31:31.54
Yeah, if you give them that, you're hurting the situation.

1292
01:31:31.54 --> 01:31:36.82
And that's why also when you're in a leadership position, you're job oftentimes is to buffer.

1293
01:31:36.82 --> 01:31:39.54
Between the jerk boss and the boys.

1294
01:31:39.54 --> 01:31:46.18
You don't, the boys should never know that the kind of stupid harassment that you get from

1295
01:31:46.18 --> 01:31:47.18
your boss.

1296
01:31:47.18 --> 01:31:48.50
The boys should never know that.

1297
01:31:48.50 --> 01:31:51.46
They should think, hey, Jockel says this guy is good to go.

1298
01:31:51.46 --> 01:31:52.46
We're good to go.

1299
01:31:52.46 --> 01:31:57.14
There's never, think this guy's unedient.

1300
01:31:57.14 --> 01:32:04.62
So again, in both cases, it's like you can't go hardcore.

1301
01:32:04.62 --> 01:32:09.50
You can't go hardcore against either the plan or the person.

1302
01:32:09.50 --> 01:32:14.14
But you also, at the same time, you need to give a little bit of a precious release.

1303
01:32:14.14 --> 01:32:15.58
Just a little bit of a precious release.

1304
01:32:15.58 --> 01:32:18.06
You know, you kind of give them just enough that they go.

1305
01:32:18.06 --> 01:32:20.74
You know what you want them to think?

1306
01:32:20.74 --> 01:32:24.58
You want them to think, hey, Jockel gets it.

1307
01:32:24.58 --> 01:32:25.98
He knows.

1308
01:32:25.98 --> 01:32:30.18
He's not admitting it to us and good on him.

1309
01:32:30.18 --> 01:32:31.98
He's keeping it professional.

1310
01:32:31.98 --> 01:32:34.58
They know that they know that Jockel, they know I don't love him.

1311
01:32:34.58 --> 01:32:39.02
They love the boss, but they know I'm keeping it professional.

1312
01:32:39.02 --> 01:32:45.82
Therefore, they accept what I'm saying and they stay part of the team.

1313
01:32:45.82 --> 01:32:50.66
Yeah, it kind of feels like I'm kind of managing myself as one of the boys.

1314
01:32:50.66 --> 01:32:55.62
You're my boss in, we don't really like your boss.

1315
01:32:55.62 --> 01:33:01.34
I feel like sure if I was made to feel better in whatever way, just a little bit better

1316
01:33:01.34 --> 01:33:05.78
than that pressure release.

1317
01:33:05.78 --> 01:33:09.38
And I trust you because of how you always handle things or whatever.

1318
01:33:09.38 --> 01:33:12.18
You know what, all right, it's not the best funness, whatever.

1319
01:33:12.18 --> 01:33:15.26
It's not my first choice, but at least we're doing it together.

1320
01:33:15.26 --> 01:33:18.26
You know, I trust you and all right, let's do this kind of thing.

1321
01:33:18.26 --> 01:33:20.86
And one of the key things you just said is trust.

1322
01:33:20.86 --> 01:33:27.90
So if you trust me and the boss is saying to do something completely ridiculous and I come

1323
01:33:27.90 --> 01:33:30.22
down and say, echo, guess what we're going to do.

1324
01:33:30.22 --> 01:33:32.94
We're going to dig this hole and then we're going to fill it back in.

1325
01:33:32.94 --> 01:33:34.98
I want to do it six times today.

1326
01:33:34.98 --> 01:33:37.54
Let's get to work and you know it's stupid.

1327
01:33:37.54 --> 01:33:42.74
And I come down and try and sell that to you without any explanation with that voice.

1328
01:33:42.74 --> 01:33:46.14
Yeah, with that voice, I'm going to lose trust.

1329
01:33:46.14 --> 01:33:47.74
You're not going to trust me as much.

1330
01:33:47.74 --> 01:33:51.70
Now if I come down and say, hey, hey, boys, hey, bringing in this is what's going on.

1331
01:33:51.70 --> 01:33:54.34
Yeah, so you're going back to your memory voice here.

1332
01:33:54.34 --> 01:33:55.94
Going back to the leadership voice.

1333
01:33:55.94 --> 01:33:57.78
Listen, hey guys, here's what's going on.

1334
01:33:57.78 --> 01:34:00.38
I know this is going to come across as a strange task.

1335
01:34:00.38 --> 01:34:01.46
We're going to get it done.

1336
01:34:01.46 --> 01:34:02.86
We got to dig these holes.

1337
01:34:02.86 --> 01:34:04.10
I don't want to fill them back in.

1338
01:34:04.10 --> 01:34:07.30
And we're actually going to do this six times today.

1339
01:34:07.30 --> 01:34:10.34
Again, I know it's not exactly what we're planning to do today.

1340
01:34:10.34 --> 01:34:11.86
But look, let's get after it.

1341
01:34:11.86 --> 01:34:12.86
Let's get it done.

1342
01:34:12.86 --> 01:34:15.66
And let's prove to everybody that we can make this happen faster than it.

1343
01:34:15.66 --> 01:34:17.66
And all of a sudden we're working to get after it.

1344
01:34:17.66 --> 01:34:18.66
You know what I mean?

1345
01:34:18.66 --> 01:34:19.66
It's no factor.

1346
01:34:19.66 --> 01:34:24.46
Whereas again, if I go into like a dorky, nerd voice and try and say, we are going to do this

1347
01:34:24.46 --> 01:34:25.90
because it's the best plan ever.

1348
01:34:25.90 --> 01:34:26.90
Yeah.

1349
01:34:26.90 --> 01:34:27.90
I'm actually hurting my trust.

1350
01:34:27.90 --> 01:34:33.50
So this is a really, really nuanced thing.

1351
01:34:33.50 --> 01:34:38.66
And my best advice here is to try and keep it in the middle.

1352
01:34:38.66 --> 01:34:39.66
Right?

1353
01:34:39.66 --> 01:34:40.66
Try and keep it in.

1354
01:34:40.66 --> 01:34:42.18
And I'll tell you probably lean a little bit.

1355
01:34:42.18 --> 01:34:43.66
Lean towards being professional.

1356
01:34:43.66 --> 01:34:46.98
Lean towards supporting the chain of command because because the guys are going to know

1357
01:34:46.98 --> 01:34:52.22
when you give them that little, little pressure relief, you say, hey, I know this is

1358
01:34:52.22 --> 01:34:53.94
this is a little bit of a strange plan.

1359
01:34:53.94 --> 01:34:55.82
As soon as I say that, everyone's like, okay, he honours.

1360
01:34:55.82 --> 01:34:56.82
Yeah, it's worth it.

1361
01:34:56.82 --> 01:34:57.82
Do whatever he says.

1362
01:34:57.82 --> 01:35:00.02
Hey, jocke, okay, jocke, we get it.

1363
01:35:00.02 --> 01:35:01.90
You got to have us do this.

1364
01:35:01.90 --> 01:35:02.90
Cool.

1365
01:35:02.90 --> 01:35:03.90
Let's do it.

1366
01:35:03.90 --> 01:35:04.90
Yeah.

1367
01:35:04.90 --> 01:35:06.14
It's when I come down and say, hmm.

1368
01:35:06.14 --> 01:35:10.30
And again, you'll realize that this is the opposite.

1369
01:35:10.30 --> 01:35:14.22
I say all the time, you know, if you come down and say the boss is plan, we got to do this.

1370
01:35:14.22 --> 01:35:18.30
I always throw that as like the worst possible leadership is, hey, we got to do this

1371
01:35:18.30 --> 01:35:20.42
because we are told to do it.

1372
01:35:20.42 --> 01:35:22.46
That's the worst possible leadership.

1373
01:35:22.46 --> 01:35:23.74
Not saying to do that.

1374
01:35:23.74 --> 01:35:26.02
What I'm saying is a little pressure relief.

1375
01:35:26.02 --> 01:35:29.78
Hey, look, I threw up a different plan.

1376
01:35:29.78 --> 01:35:31.46
I thought my plan was a little bit better.

1377
01:35:31.46 --> 01:35:32.78
Boss came up with this idea.

1378
01:35:32.78 --> 01:35:34.18
We're going to go for it.

1379
01:35:34.18 --> 01:35:35.18
It's close enough.

1380
01:35:35.18 --> 01:35:36.18
Just something like that.

1381
01:35:36.18 --> 01:35:37.18
Just like, I know.

1382
01:35:37.18 --> 01:35:38.18
I know.

1383
01:35:38.18 --> 01:35:39.18
I think it, yeah.

1384
01:35:39.18 --> 01:35:40.18
That's it.

1385
01:35:40.18 --> 01:35:42.18
Little, little, little, little nugget.

1386
01:35:42.18 --> 01:35:45.94
Yeah, I feel like I would feel if you were to be like, this is such a dumb plan.

1387
01:35:45.94 --> 01:35:47.90
And I don't know why we got to do it or whatever.

1388
01:35:47.90 --> 01:35:49.70
I'd be like, wait, wait, then why are we doing that?

1389
01:35:49.70 --> 01:35:50.70
Exactly.

1390
01:35:50.70 --> 01:35:52.70
You're my bot, why are we doing that?

1391
01:35:52.70 --> 01:35:53.70
Yeah.

1392
01:35:53.70 --> 01:35:54.70
And I wouldn't want to do it.

1393
01:35:54.70 --> 01:35:55.70
No.

1394
01:35:55.70 --> 01:35:57.74
Hopefully, it's like right in the middle there.

1395
01:35:57.74 --> 01:35:59.74
It's leaning towards being professional.

1396
01:35:59.74 --> 01:36:04.26
It's leaning towards supporting the chain of command with just enough of a pressure relief

1397
01:36:04.26 --> 01:36:05.66
to have them say.

1398
01:36:05.66 --> 01:36:06.66
I'll tell you story.

1399
01:36:06.66 --> 01:36:08.66
This is real quick.

1400
01:36:08.66 --> 01:36:10.30
This was in, take your time.

1401
01:36:10.30 --> 01:36:11.66
I want you to tell me the longest story.

1402
01:36:11.66 --> 01:36:12.66
We're going back to ninth grade.

1403
01:36:12.66 --> 01:36:13.66
No, it's three.

1404
01:36:13.66 --> 01:36:14.66
And this is pretty high school.

1405
01:36:14.66 --> 01:36:16.78
It's weird that I even thought of this.

1406
01:36:16.78 --> 01:36:19.30
So we, we, you know how I'm like in class, right?

1407
01:36:19.30 --> 01:36:22.46
This, uh, a high early high school freshman.

1408
01:36:22.46 --> 01:36:23.94
You know, in class.

1409
01:36:23.94 --> 01:36:25.74
They're like, hey, get into groups.

1410
01:36:25.74 --> 01:36:27.06
We're going to do this thing.

1411
01:36:27.06 --> 01:36:32.50
And, um, so we got into these groups and we did some project little thing during class.

1412
01:36:32.50 --> 01:36:34.18
We were done halfway through class.

1413
01:36:34.18 --> 01:36:37.82
We're done and we're about to present the teacher looks at it.

1414
01:36:37.82 --> 01:36:40.66
And it's like, oh, you guys got to do it again.

1415
01:36:40.66 --> 01:36:42.06
But the teacher doesn't tell everyone.

1416
01:36:42.06 --> 01:36:44.46
She tells us just this one girl Marla is her name.

1417
01:36:44.46 --> 01:36:45.46
Marla.

1418
01:36:45.46 --> 01:36:46.46
Yeah.

1419
01:36:46.46 --> 01:36:51.58
So Marla comes back from talking to the teacher and she's like, she was kind of a leader.

1420
01:36:51.58 --> 01:36:52.58
No, and David.

1421
01:36:52.58 --> 01:36:56.70
At that point, she was kind of a little leader that liaison between the group.

1422
01:36:56.70 --> 01:36:57.70
Right.

1423
01:36:57.70 --> 01:37:00.82
So she comes back to like, she's like, we got to do it again.

1424
01:37:00.82 --> 01:37:01.82
And everyone was like, what?

1425
01:37:01.82 --> 01:37:03.18
She goes, we got to do it again.

1426
01:37:03.18 --> 01:37:05.58
Like, you could tell she had accepted it.

1427
01:37:05.58 --> 01:37:10.14
But just her being like, sign kind of demonstrated that, hey, she feels the pain too.

1428
01:37:10.14 --> 01:37:11.14
I dig it.

1429
01:37:11.14 --> 01:37:13.66
But hey, guys, you know, we're not going to complain right.

1430
01:37:13.66 --> 01:37:15.02
It's just that little subtle thing.

1431
01:37:15.02 --> 01:37:16.90
But that's exactly what it did.

1432
01:37:16.90 --> 01:37:21.82
It kind of, it basically accepted the order that none of us really wanted to hear.

1433
01:37:21.82 --> 01:37:24.94
But at the same time, she demonstrated that, hey, she feels it too.

1434
01:37:24.94 --> 01:37:25.94
You know, and let's do it.

1435
01:37:25.94 --> 01:37:26.94
We did again, of course.

1436
01:37:26.94 --> 01:37:27.94
And whatever.

1437
01:37:27.94 --> 01:37:28.94
I don't even know what grade we have.

1438
01:37:28.94 --> 01:37:29.94
It's got an A plus.

1439
01:37:29.94 --> 01:37:34.02
I'm sure Marla workers and her leadership skills on this.

1440
01:37:34.02 --> 01:37:37.42
Yeah, it was weird that, I mean, I don't know necessarily that she intended to do that.

1441
01:37:37.42 --> 01:37:38.82
But that was the exact effect.

1442
01:37:38.82 --> 01:37:43.34
And you can think and back, I can see the elements, you know, the little pressure release

1443
01:37:43.34 --> 01:37:47.06
was her not saying, don't talk to me like that.

1444
01:37:47.06 --> 01:37:48.06
She said we got to do it.

1445
01:37:48.06 --> 01:37:49.46
She didn't like a pose anybody.

1446
01:37:49.46 --> 01:37:52.82
But he heard just heard little she, how mannerisms she didn't do.

1447
01:37:52.82 --> 01:37:55.94
She didn't jump completely on board with the teacher.

1448
01:37:55.94 --> 01:37:56.94
Yeah.

1449
01:37:56.94 --> 01:37:58.62
And be like, we got to do this again.

1450
01:37:58.62 --> 01:37:59.62
It sucked.

1451
01:37:59.62 --> 01:38:01.98
No, she was like, hey, look, we got what I have to do this again.

1452
01:38:01.98 --> 01:38:02.98
You know what I mean?

1453
01:38:02.98 --> 01:38:03.98
She just took the tongue.

1454
01:38:03.98 --> 01:38:04.98
She was perfect.

1455
01:38:04.98 --> 01:38:08.62
And I'll tell you, this question, I'm surprised it took so long to get this question.

1456
01:38:08.62 --> 01:38:10.82
Because this is a really, really good question.

1457
01:38:10.82 --> 01:38:17.18
And it also is a incredibly important skill to be able to walk this line and it's

1458
01:38:17.18 --> 01:38:19.42
tricky to do.

1459
01:38:19.42 --> 01:38:27.66
And it's a very, it's sort of, this might be one of the, this is like the type of thing

1460
01:38:27.66 --> 01:38:29.50
that helped me a lot.

1461
01:38:29.50 --> 01:38:33.54
When I was in the team was just being able to do this enough because you could do some

1462
01:38:33.54 --> 01:38:36.02
dumb shit with the team's man.

1463
01:38:36.02 --> 01:38:37.02
And you know what?

1464
01:38:37.02 --> 01:38:43.34
It's like, okay, being able to translate a stupid, something stupid and give enough

1465
01:38:43.34 --> 01:38:49.10
pressure relief to make guys not just go, joc was just, you know, company guy.

1466
01:38:49.10 --> 01:38:50.10
Right, it's a company guy.

1467
01:38:50.10 --> 01:38:52.94
He just lives, oh, he doesn't stand up for us.

1468
01:38:52.94 --> 01:38:54.62
No, actually I do.

1469
01:38:54.62 --> 01:38:57.86
But this is, you know, like, life's all telling that story about doing paperwork.

1470
01:38:57.86 --> 01:38:58.86
I don't know.

1471
01:38:58.86 --> 01:39:00.62
I'm like, no, we're going to do all the paperwork.

1472
01:39:00.62 --> 01:39:06.74
I, I went, I had the company line, but like in such a dynamic or such an overboard way

1473
01:39:06.74 --> 01:39:08.98
that guys were like, okay, yeah, we're going to win.

1474
01:39:08.98 --> 01:39:10.62
Yeah, this is a competition.

1475
01:39:10.62 --> 01:39:11.62
Yeah.

1476
01:39:11.62 --> 01:39:12.62
So that's good times.

1477
01:39:12.62 --> 01:39:14.42
Yeah, it's like a meet.

1478
01:39:14.42 --> 01:39:18.58
Because it seems like, okay, all that paperwork, it's almost like the paperwork was like

1479
01:39:18.58 --> 01:39:19.58
an affront, dude.

1480
01:39:19.58 --> 01:39:21.78
It's like, hey, what is the us against them kind of?

1481
01:39:21.78 --> 01:39:22.78
Right.

1482
01:39:22.78 --> 01:39:23.78
And whoever told us to do the paperwork.

1483
01:39:23.78 --> 01:39:26.78
And you were like, yeah, it's obviously a them and we're going to do this.

1484
01:39:26.78 --> 01:39:27.78
We is being exactly.

1485
01:39:27.78 --> 01:39:29.18
You know, so it's like you take it to them.

1486
01:39:29.18 --> 01:39:30.18
Yeah.

1487
01:39:30.18 --> 01:39:31.18
That's something I've done.

1488
01:39:31.18 --> 01:39:32.46
I've actually done that a fair amount.

1489
01:39:32.46 --> 01:39:35.34
I talked about the story before, but like an officer candidate school, every little

1490
01:39:35.34 --> 01:39:36.98
stupid rule that they threw at us.

1491
01:39:36.98 --> 01:39:40.62
I did it to the end three and had everyone at class to the end three where they were just

1492
01:39:40.62 --> 01:39:41.62
going.

1493
01:39:41.62 --> 01:39:42.62
Yeah, yeah, going ballistic.

1494
01:39:42.62 --> 01:39:46.74
So a story like that where we're just going, we're going to take with their take

1495
01:39:46.74 --> 01:39:50.30
the order and carry it out to the extra even take pride in doing that.

1496
01:39:50.30 --> 01:39:53.22
That was not a little tactic that got used by me along the way.

1497
01:39:53.22 --> 01:39:55.02
Yeah, we're going to do that.

1498
01:39:55.02 --> 01:39:56.02
We can do it so hard.

1499
01:39:56.02 --> 01:39:59.06
You're not even know what your name was.

1500
01:39:59.06 --> 01:40:00.54
That's another tactic you can take.

1501
01:40:00.54 --> 01:40:01.54
For sure.

1502
01:40:01.54 --> 01:40:03.14
They want us to polish these boots.

1503
01:40:03.14 --> 01:40:04.78
They want us to clean this thing.

1504
01:40:04.78 --> 01:40:06.18
We'll do it.

1505
01:40:06.18 --> 01:40:07.18
Watch this.

1506
01:40:07.18 --> 01:40:08.18
All right.

1507
01:40:08.18 --> 01:40:10.18
Next question.

1508
01:40:10.18 --> 01:40:11.18
Next question.

1509
01:40:11.18 --> 01:40:12.18
Jocco.

1510
01:40:12.18 --> 01:40:18.26
Has there been a situation in which you took something too personally?

1511
01:40:18.26 --> 01:40:20.10
How do you avoid taking things personally?

1512
01:40:20.10 --> 01:40:22.86
So the initial reaction is like, no man, I don't take things too personally.

1513
01:40:22.86 --> 01:40:23.86
You don't want to keep it.

1514
01:40:23.86 --> 01:40:25.42
But the actual fact is, yeah, I take things.

1515
01:40:25.42 --> 01:40:26.58
I take everything personally.

1516
01:40:26.58 --> 01:40:27.58
Right?

1517
01:40:27.58 --> 01:40:33.38
Like, I mean, if I do something bad, I am very personally.

1518
01:40:33.38 --> 01:40:34.94
I don't like it at all.

1519
01:40:34.94 --> 01:40:36.58
If I do something poorly, I don't like it at all.

1520
01:40:36.58 --> 01:40:37.58
I take it very personally.

1521
01:40:37.58 --> 01:40:41.38
If somebody gives me feedback, I take it personally.

1522
01:40:41.38 --> 01:40:44.10
This is like, it's an ego thing.

1523
01:40:44.10 --> 01:40:45.50
It's a pure ego thing.

1524
01:40:45.50 --> 01:40:46.50
Right?

1525
01:40:46.50 --> 01:40:48.94
And I just had to say this at a group I was talking to.

1526
01:40:48.94 --> 01:40:52.90
Just because I say ego is bad all the time, ego is good too.

1527
01:40:52.90 --> 01:40:54.18
Ego is what drives you.

1528
01:40:54.18 --> 01:40:56.66
Ego is what makes you want to be number one.

1529
01:40:56.66 --> 01:40:59.26
ego is what brings you pride in your work.

1530
01:40:59.26 --> 01:41:05.14
It makes you work harder to give deliver good product and be a good leader and a good employee

1531
01:41:05.14 --> 01:41:06.70
and a good person.

1532
01:41:06.70 --> 01:41:07.70
Right?

1533
01:41:07.70 --> 01:41:08.70
That's ego.

1534
01:41:08.70 --> 01:41:15.82
It comes when ego or taking things personally actually prevents you from listening to the

1535
01:41:15.82 --> 01:41:17.10
critiques that you're being told.

1536
01:41:17.10 --> 01:41:18.10
That's the problem.

1537
01:41:18.10 --> 01:41:21.54
So for instance, we'll take this little podcast right here.

1538
01:41:21.54 --> 01:41:23.30
I've got some critique on it the other day.

1539
01:41:23.30 --> 01:41:24.30
Yeah.

1540
01:41:24.30 --> 01:41:30.06
I've got somebody who sent me a little critique and they said that I didn't explain

1541
01:41:30.06 --> 01:41:35.14
because we had Andy Snumpfone here and Andy was kind of rattling off his career in the

1542
01:41:35.14 --> 01:41:36.14
teams.

1543
01:41:36.14 --> 01:41:38.34
He was rattling off the career in the teams.

1544
01:41:38.34 --> 01:41:40.38
He lost some people.

1545
01:41:40.38 --> 01:41:43.74
Not a bunch because it wasn't that complicated but he lost some people.

1546
01:41:43.74 --> 01:41:53.74
And for instance, he used an acronym, an acronym, an acronym LPO which stands for leading

1547
01:41:53.74 --> 01:42:00.94
petty officer which is the second senior enlisted person in a seal platoon and I didn't

1548
01:42:00.94 --> 01:42:02.38
explain that when he said it.

1549
01:42:02.38 --> 01:42:03.66
So there's an example.

1550
01:42:03.66 --> 01:42:07.18
So when I heard this, my first reaction is like, oh, you don't know what LPO is.

1551
01:42:07.18 --> 01:42:09.18
Go Google it.

1552
01:42:09.18 --> 01:42:10.90
Go Google it.

1553
01:42:10.90 --> 01:42:11.90
Why are you asking me?

1554
01:42:11.90 --> 01:42:14.26
It'll break stop talk.

1555
01:42:14.26 --> 01:42:19.50
And then that was pretty much, you know, my ego was saying, hey, I can't believe this

1556
01:42:19.50 --> 01:42:20.50
person does.

1557
01:42:20.50 --> 01:42:21.50
Yeah, how dare you?

1558
01:42:21.50 --> 01:42:22.50
I'll dare you.

1559
01:42:22.50 --> 01:42:25.14
And then I thought about I was like, well, you know, I need to make sure in the future

1560
01:42:25.14 --> 01:42:29.62
that I'm more aware of what guys are talking, especially when I'm sitting here talking

1561
01:42:29.62 --> 01:42:37.10
to another seal who we have a common language and we are talking about things in a very

1562
01:42:37.10 --> 01:42:38.10
conversational mode.

1563
01:42:38.10 --> 01:42:40.02
So we're not caring about anybody else.

1564
01:42:40.02 --> 01:42:44.98
And that's sort of what the podcast is often is like, we're not talking to everyone

1565
01:42:44.98 --> 01:42:45.98
that's listening at this moment.

1566
01:42:45.98 --> 01:42:48.86
We're just kind of talking to ourselves or amongst ourselves.

1567
01:42:48.86 --> 01:42:52.58
And so when he throws out this words, I need to be more aware of them.

1568
01:42:52.58 --> 01:42:54.98
So if I took it personally, I might not listen.

1569
01:42:54.98 --> 01:42:59.02
If I actually listen, I can do a better job.

1570
01:42:59.02 --> 01:43:05.34
So that's kind of it.

1571
01:43:05.34 --> 01:43:10.06
And basically that's the same with anybody when anybody receives any criticism of any kind.

1572
01:43:10.06 --> 01:43:13.90
They get, they take it personally.

1573
01:43:13.90 --> 01:43:16.78
And I think the thing is two things.

1574
01:43:16.78 --> 01:43:21.66
Number one, get over it so you can listen to what the criticism is.

1575
01:43:21.66 --> 01:43:23.34
And also remember this.

1576
01:43:23.34 --> 01:43:24.34
This is kind of weird.

1577
01:43:24.34 --> 01:43:25.34
I think maybe I'm wrong.

1578
01:43:25.34 --> 01:43:27.22
What do you think?

1579
01:43:27.22 --> 01:43:35.94
The more angry and the more personally you take some criticism, the true or it actually

1580
01:43:35.94 --> 01:43:36.94
is.

1581
01:43:36.94 --> 01:43:38.50
Is that possible?

1582
01:43:38.50 --> 01:43:42.58
When something really bothers you, it's probably something that really bothers you

1583
01:43:42.58 --> 01:43:44.46
because you know it's true.

1584
01:43:44.46 --> 01:43:50.14
Like when somebody says something that just doesn't matter to me, it's, you know, I don't

1585
01:43:50.14 --> 01:43:51.14
take it personally.

1586
01:43:51.14 --> 01:43:52.14
Oh, yeah, they just think that.

1587
01:43:52.14 --> 01:43:53.14
Don't worry about it.

1588
01:43:53.14 --> 01:43:54.14
I'm not worried about it.

1589
01:43:54.14 --> 01:43:58.26
Maybe says something that I know is true and they're paying you.

1590
01:43:58.26 --> 01:44:00.54
That means I get even more.

1591
01:44:00.54 --> 01:44:02.74
Take it more personally and get more angry about it.

1592
01:44:02.74 --> 01:44:04.62
And then that should be an indicator.

1593
01:44:04.62 --> 01:44:06.66
Hey, this is something you actually need to fix.

1594
01:44:06.66 --> 01:44:10.22
Yeah, it actually has to do with insecurity more than anything.

1595
01:44:10.22 --> 01:44:14.46
So it can be, it can be super true or it can be kind of true or you can just be questioning

1596
01:44:14.46 --> 01:44:15.78
whether or not it's true.

1597
01:44:15.78 --> 01:44:19.14
If you're insecure about it, that's when it's going to be, because you can be like,

1598
01:44:19.14 --> 01:44:22.46
there can be, okay, you know, let's say guys have a receding here like, and they're like,

1599
01:44:22.46 --> 01:44:24.62
oh, I don't care about that at all.

1600
01:44:24.62 --> 01:44:28.66
It's totally true, you know, and or let's say I do care about it.

1601
01:44:28.66 --> 01:44:32.22
I don't like it, but I, I've known it for the last 20 years, whatever.

1602
01:44:32.22 --> 01:44:34.78
And so I was like, hey, you know, your hairlines receding.

1603
01:44:34.78 --> 01:44:36.62
Do you like to care about that?

1604
01:44:36.62 --> 01:44:38.10
I don't think they do.

1605
01:44:38.10 --> 01:44:39.10
No, I don't know.

1606
01:44:39.10 --> 01:44:40.98
I mean, but I'm just saying these certain things.

1607
01:44:40.98 --> 01:44:46.90
It's, and if you know about it or you know, and you know it's true, and see, you

1608
01:44:46.90 --> 01:44:48.82
won't necessarily be bothered by it.

1609
01:44:48.82 --> 01:44:53.82
But if you get someone who's like, it's starting to recede early on or it's like,

1610
01:44:53.82 --> 01:44:59.02
dang, and they won't necessarily be, this is just an example hypothetical, but they won't

1611
01:44:59.02 --> 01:45:03.02
necessarily be concerned about the actual hairline receding.

1612
01:45:03.02 --> 01:45:05.86
They're more concerned about, oh, do I look older?

1613
01:45:05.86 --> 01:45:07.10
Am I unattractive now?

1614
01:45:07.10 --> 01:45:08.26
Or am I losing it now?

1615
01:45:08.26 --> 01:45:09.26
Or something like that?

1616
01:45:09.26 --> 01:45:10.66
That's what they're insecure about.

1617
01:45:10.66 --> 01:45:14.46
So when someone points out some symptom of that insecurity, that's when they're like,

1618
01:45:14.46 --> 01:45:18.06
well, you know, they get on, oh man, that goes for kind of anything.

1619
01:45:18.06 --> 01:45:23.78
So maybe, I don't know, maybe someone's saying, hey, you didn't explain this enough.

1620
01:45:23.78 --> 01:45:25.82
Maybe you're like, what are you saying?

1621
01:45:25.82 --> 01:45:30.14
Was that a junk episode kind of thing or something like, did I not, you know how you,

1622
01:45:30.14 --> 01:45:33.38
you're good at explaining stuff and simplifying them or whatever, maybe it was like an

1623
01:45:33.38 --> 01:45:34.38
attack on matters.

1624
01:45:34.38 --> 01:45:36.10
Maybe it's a personal point of pride.

1625
01:45:36.10 --> 01:45:38.14
Yeah, yeah, you know exactly.

1626
01:45:38.14 --> 01:45:39.14
I don't know.

1627
01:45:39.14 --> 01:45:42.10
Yeah, but maybe, but that's typically what people get mad about.

1628
01:45:42.10 --> 01:45:45.82
It's not necessarily if they know it's true or not, it's if they're insecure about it.

1629
01:45:45.82 --> 01:45:48.42
Right, well, you wouldn't be insecure about something that wasn't true.

1630
01:45:48.42 --> 01:45:52.82
No, but here's the thing, but sometimes you do, because you know, and you, sometimes

1631
01:45:52.82 --> 01:45:57.50
it's like a weird like mental problem, but, you know, girls, for example, I'm not saying

1632
01:45:57.50 --> 01:46:00.70
all girls, but I'm gonna totally generalize right now.

1633
01:46:00.70 --> 01:46:02.86
But you know, the girls like, hey, do I look fat in this?

1634
01:46:02.86 --> 01:46:05.06
The girls like an awesome shape or whatever.

1635
01:46:05.06 --> 01:46:08.38
And you're like, they always think they're fat.

1636
01:46:08.38 --> 01:46:09.38
That's not true.

1637
01:46:09.38 --> 01:46:11.38
That's not the right response by the way.

1638
01:46:11.38 --> 01:46:12.38
That's not where she was.

1639
01:46:12.38 --> 01:46:14.38
That's not the perfect example though.

1640
01:46:14.38 --> 01:46:15.38
You know what I mean?

1641
01:46:15.38 --> 01:46:17.74
So, it's like that kind of stuff.

1642
01:46:17.74 --> 01:46:20.46
You know, people are just insecure about stuff sometimes.

1643
01:46:20.46 --> 01:46:22.90
Oh, and even though the girls are really good-shamed.

1644
01:46:22.90 --> 01:46:23.90
Yeah.

1645
01:46:23.90 --> 01:46:25.90
Yeah, that's horrible.

1646
01:46:25.90 --> 01:46:30.46
Or even guys, especially like if they're into like their physique or something like that,

1647
01:46:30.46 --> 01:46:33.74
were, I don't know, they're at a party or so.

1648
01:46:33.74 --> 01:46:37.06
I've heard guys like they go to parties and they'll do like dips or push-ups before they

1649
01:46:37.06 --> 01:46:39.90
walk in because like, so they're like more pumped.

1650
01:46:39.90 --> 01:46:40.90
I swear.

1651
01:46:40.90 --> 01:46:42.90
And is that why you're doing some push-ups?

1652
01:46:42.90 --> 01:46:46.42
That's what you're doing.

1653
01:46:46.42 --> 01:46:49.90
That means they're like, you're just a little insecure about what I just said.

1654
01:46:49.90 --> 01:46:52.90
That's what I said.

1655
01:46:52.90 --> 01:46:58.42
Anyway, you know, they'll get that kind of where they'll be like, oh, I'm, they'll think

1656
01:46:58.42 --> 01:47:00.94
that, oh, I'm not looking very cut up for something like that.

1657
01:47:00.94 --> 01:47:01.94
You know, like that kind of stuff.

1658
01:47:01.94 --> 01:47:03.82
Well, it's not true.

1659
01:47:03.82 --> 01:47:04.82
Yeah.

1660
01:47:04.82 --> 01:47:05.82
Yeah.

1661
01:47:05.82 --> 01:47:07.34
No, I think that's a good point.

1662
01:47:07.34 --> 01:47:12.86
And I think the bottom line is when we take things personally, I think,

1663
01:47:12.86 --> 01:47:18.94
it's actually not a negative thing because it means that there's probably something that

1664
01:47:18.94 --> 01:47:20.30
you need to work on.

1665
01:47:20.30 --> 01:47:23.54
But I think what we need to watch out for is taking it personally and therefore being

1666
01:47:23.54 --> 01:47:29.06
mad and either be mad at the person that told you, which the person probably could be

1667
01:47:29.06 --> 01:47:32.78
out of line, you know, saying some stuff that's offensive.

1668
01:47:32.78 --> 01:47:34.78
But even if someone offends you.

1669
01:47:34.78 --> 01:47:35.78
Well, okay.

1670
01:47:35.78 --> 01:47:36.78
Well, let's fix it.

1671
01:47:36.78 --> 01:47:40.18
So you don't have that weakness or that insecurity anymore.

1672
01:47:40.18 --> 01:47:43.22
So just know what your red flags are, knowing you're taking something, everybody takes

1673
01:47:43.22 --> 01:47:44.22
stuff personally.

1674
01:47:44.22 --> 01:47:45.22
Yeah.

1675
01:47:45.22 --> 01:47:49.30
I'm like Mr. Detachment and I take stuff personally all the time and somebody says something

1676
01:47:49.30 --> 01:47:50.30
to me, I'm like, oh, okay.

1677
01:47:50.30 --> 01:47:52.30
Why don't I do the do better?

1678
01:47:52.30 --> 01:47:53.30
Yeah.

1679
01:47:53.30 --> 01:47:54.30
You do good job.

1680
01:47:54.30 --> 01:47:55.50
We'll see in the big picture, though.

1681
01:47:55.50 --> 01:47:58.90
You know, like, because a lot of times, you don't want, I don't know.

1682
01:47:58.90 --> 01:48:01.18
I always think back to the relationship.

1683
01:48:01.18 --> 01:48:03.94
Like, okay, let's say, let's say I'm at home.

1684
01:48:03.94 --> 01:48:05.18
I'm mowing the lawn.

1685
01:48:05.18 --> 01:48:09.82
I, you know, did all this great housework chores, whatever.

1686
01:48:09.82 --> 01:48:15.50
You know, dad comes home, mom comes home and they're like, hey, I thought I told you

1687
01:48:15.50 --> 01:48:16.50
to take out the trash.

1688
01:48:16.50 --> 01:48:18.50
Meanwhile, everything else is speaking span.

1689
01:48:18.50 --> 01:48:21.10
So I'm like, I'm mad.

1690
01:48:21.10 --> 01:48:25.50
You know, how dare you say that to me when I did this mean me, my thing, my thing, but

1691
01:48:25.50 --> 01:48:27.10
at the same time, they're right.

1692
01:48:27.10 --> 01:48:30.22
You know, so you do a good job of like, you'd be able to recognize that.

1693
01:48:30.22 --> 01:48:32.58
Even though you probably feel those same feelings.

1694
01:48:32.58 --> 01:48:38.82
You won't, your default isn't what about this and fight back and make the prom bigger.

1695
01:48:38.82 --> 01:48:43.66
It's kind of like, you'll feel it on the inside and recognize the red flags of what's

1696
01:48:43.66 --> 01:48:44.66
happening.

1697
01:48:44.66 --> 01:48:49.18
You're like, okay, I gotta remember taking out the trash because the truth is that's correct.

1698
01:48:49.18 --> 01:48:50.18
That is correct.

1699
01:48:50.18 --> 01:48:53.78
It doesn't matter if you did the lawn or not, the trash was a thing, you know.

1700
01:48:53.78 --> 01:48:57.98
So yeah, yeah, you do a good job of recognizing that part.

1701
01:48:57.98 --> 01:49:03.34
I think a lot of times, in our case, we don't do such a good job.

1702
01:49:03.34 --> 01:49:04.34
You know, I'm going to throw this out.

1703
01:49:04.34 --> 01:49:06.70
There's this little off subject, but it just made me think of it.

1704
01:49:06.70 --> 01:49:10.94
He was talking to Dave at the gym yesterday.

1705
01:49:10.94 --> 01:49:19.66
He was listening to the podcast and he lost his dad and like six months ago.

1706
01:49:19.66 --> 01:49:26.30
And he was listening to a clip from the podcast of me basically saying, hey, because

1707
01:49:26.30 --> 01:49:30.54
someone asked what good comes from when someone dies.

1708
01:49:30.54 --> 01:49:35.26
And he said, look, you covered a lot of stuff and it was super powerful and it was very

1709
01:49:35.26 --> 01:49:36.26
helpful.

1710
01:49:36.26 --> 01:49:38.54
But there's a one more thing.

1711
01:49:38.54 --> 01:49:44.34
He said, there's one more thing that has come from my dad's death that it's good.

1712
01:49:44.34 --> 01:49:46.82
And I said, what?

1713
01:49:46.82 --> 01:49:55.22
And he said, it was like a slap in the face of go out and get after it.

1714
01:49:55.22 --> 01:49:57.26
You know, and I kind of left that out.

1715
01:49:57.26 --> 01:49:59.18
And I've talked to other people.

1716
01:49:59.18 --> 01:50:03.86
And clearly, you know, when you lose someone that's close to you, see the reason I guess

1717
01:50:03.86 --> 01:50:09.30
the reason that I didn't think of this is because in the teams, you kind of like, you guys

1718
01:50:09.30 --> 01:50:11.54
get killed, you know.

1719
01:50:11.54 --> 01:50:16.62
And we all kind of already live with the feeling of, hey, man, I mean, I say it all the time.

1720
01:50:16.62 --> 01:50:19.74
I'm going to live the best life I can.

1721
01:50:19.74 --> 01:50:25.38
But for someone in the civilian sector, and they haven't had any, they haven't lost anyone.

1722
01:50:25.38 --> 01:50:27.70
They haven't had anyone died close to them.

1723
01:50:27.70 --> 01:50:32.90
They get the feeling that many of us, many people walk through the world with of, I'm

1724
01:50:32.90 --> 01:50:33.90
in a living forever.

1725
01:50:33.90 --> 01:50:35.12
You know, I'm not going to die.

1726
01:50:35.12 --> 01:50:37.70
And I got all the time and the world had me back at time.

1727
01:50:37.70 --> 01:50:39.26
And so he made this great point.

1728
01:50:39.26 --> 01:50:44.66
He said, you know, for me, when my dad died, he's, you know, he's in his mid 20's.

1729
01:50:44.66 --> 01:50:49.54
And he's been kind of, you know, I don't want to say that we're relaxing, but he's been,

1730
01:50:49.54 --> 01:50:53.20
you know, fairly, he's been cruising kind of.

1731
01:50:53.20 --> 01:50:55.94
And he realized he can't, he can't do that.

1732
01:50:55.94 --> 01:50:58.34
You know, he needs to get after it.

1733
01:50:58.34 --> 01:51:01.62
So cool, cool story, cool feedback.

1734
01:51:01.62 --> 01:51:04.38
I thought I should let everybody know that's another good thing.

1735
01:51:04.38 --> 01:51:12.18
When if you lose someone and you're not accustomed to that and you don't see how precious life is

1736
01:51:12.18 --> 01:51:14.34
because a lot of times it's pretty easy to forget.

1737
01:51:14.34 --> 01:51:20.94
It's pretty easy to forget how precious it is when it's right there when it's given to you.

1738
01:51:20.94 --> 01:51:22.42
You know, it's just like food.

1739
01:51:22.42 --> 01:51:23.74
It's pretty easy to forget.

1740
01:51:23.74 --> 01:51:27.98
I mean, how precious was the was the crappy loaf of French bread with sticks and bugs

1741
01:51:27.98 --> 01:51:31.26
of it that Colonel Rita got when he got to the prison camp in Hanoi?

1742
01:51:31.26 --> 01:51:33.10
That was precious.

1743
01:51:33.10 --> 01:51:34.10
And you know what?

1744
01:51:34.10 --> 01:51:38.26
Even Colonel Rita three weeks later he was like, oh, this bread even he's here he's laughing.

1745
01:51:38.26 --> 01:51:39.26
He's like, that bread sucked.

1746
01:51:39.26 --> 01:51:41.06
I was like, sir, here you said it was like the best thing you've ever had.

1747
01:51:41.06 --> 01:51:43.02
He goes, well, it wasn't first.

1748
01:51:43.02 --> 01:51:48.14
So we all get, we all get this attitude that, you know, hey, this is always going to be here.

1749
01:51:48.14 --> 01:51:49.46
Well, it's not always going to be here.

1750
01:51:49.46 --> 01:51:52.26
So don't treat it like it is.

1751
01:51:52.26 --> 01:51:53.82
Taking that for granted.

1752
01:51:53.82 --> 01:51:54.82
Yep.

1753
01:51:54.82 --> 01:51:57.18
Next question.

1754
01:51:57.18 --> 01:52:02.42
Hi, Jocco.

1755
01:52:02.42 --> 01:52:08.42
I'm being told in Jiu Jitsu that I'm using too much strength to execute techniques and dominating

1756
01:52:08.42 --> 01:52:09.42
roles.

1757
01:52:09.42 --> 01:52:13.02
I get after it in the gym and try to be stronger and fitter.

1758
01:52:13.02 --> 01:52:18.10
I already limit my strength against same weight training partners and definitely don't

1759
01:52:18.10 --> 01:52:20.10
pull.

1760
01:52:20.10 --> 01:52:23.02
Don't bull rush or overpower lighter partners.

1761
01:52:23.02 --> 01:52:27.54
I want to improve my Jiu Jitsu knowledge and understand the intent of reducing my strength

1762
01:52:27.54 --> 01:52:30.66
and it reduces my strength to learn the skill.

1763
01:52:30.66 --> 01:52:32.54
But where is the balance?

1764
01:52:32.54 --> 01:52:38.78
I feel like I'm doing, being penalized for working hard and being strong.

1765
01:52:38.78 --> 01:52:43.70
There has to be an element of strength to technique, right?

1766
01:52:43.70 --> 01:52:48.86
Now that I'm trying to do zero strength working weak positions and they still go 100% on

1767
01:52:48.86 --> 01:52:51.02
me, I'm not learning anything, right?

1768
01:52:51.02 --> 01:52:54.22
What is asking?

1769
01:52:54.22 --> 01:52:58.82
What is my 25% stronger than my training partners?

1770
01:52:58.82 --> 01:53:03.82
100% of training no-gu for four years but ghee only for 12 months.

1771
01:53:03.82 --> 01:53:05.82
Don't judge a way, Bill.

1772
01:53:05.82 --> 01:53:07.42
We're here.

1773
01:53:07.42 --> 01:53:15.14
Okay, so you know, I don't think anyone is saying use zero strength and just be a, are

1774
01:53:15.14 --> 01:53:19.14
you to have kids in the kids class that would just flop around.

1775
01:53:19.14 --> 01:53:23.58
You know, they'd be like noodles, you know, especially when you're a partner, right?

1776
01:53:23.58 --> 01:53:25.06
And I say, hey, don't be that.

1777
01:53:25.06 --> 01:53:27.30
So no one's telling you to use zero strength.

1778
01:53:27.30 --> 01:53:30.38
That's not the goal here.

1779
01:53:30.38 --> 01:53:36.18
You just want to use less strength and I'm the same way man, I work out so I can be strong.

1780
01:53:36.18 --> 01:53:39.86
And when we're rolling, if I have to use strength, I'm going to use it.

1781
01:53:39.86 --> 01:53:43.06
You bench pressed me off off you the other day from across I.

1782
01:53:43.06 --> 01:53:44.06
I'll technique.

1783
01:53:44.06 --> 01:53:45.06
Yeah, I'll tell you.

1784
01:53:45.06 --> 01:53:49.10
You know, you even claimed it at the top.

1785
01:53:49.10 --> 01:53:50.90
You're like, that's all weight lifted.

1786
01:53:50.90 --> 01:53:52.54
So that's good, right?

1787
01:53:52.54 --> 01:53:54.58
And you used it because you had to use it.

1788
01:53:54.58 --> 01:53:57.74
You were going to get punished and you're like, oh, I'm not going to have jockel across

1789
01:53:57.74 --> 01:53:58.74
the side.

1790
01:53:58.74 --> 01:53:59.74
Just rolling in the roll.

1791
01:53:59.74 --> 01:54:00.74
So boom, got bench pressed.

1792
01:54:00.74 --> 01:54:01.74
People were watching too much.

1793
01:54:01.74 --> 01:54:02.74
Yeah, yeah.

1794
01:54:02.74 --> 01:54:06.54
So yeah, we want to be strong for sure.

1795
01:54:06.54 --> 01:54:08.58
But I'll tell you, this is a, is a key thing.

1796
01:54:08.58 --> 01:54:15.06
When I'm going to train with someone, I'm going to use just enough skill and strength

1797
01:54:15.06 --> 01:54:17.58
to stay slightly ahead of them.

1798
01:54:17.58 --> 01:54:18.82
That's enough.

1799
01:54:18.82 --> 01:54:22.26
I'm not trying to crush them.

1800
01:54:22.26 --> 01:54:26.22
If someone's any, I'm going to tell you if someone's way lighter than me, then, but they

1801
01:54:26.22 --> 01:54:30.06
have kind of a equivalent skill that I'm going to try and limit my strength as much as I

1802
01:54:30.06 --> 01:54:31.06
can.

1803
01:54:31.06 --> 01:54:32.78
So it's due to your risk of due to for sure.

1804
01:54:32.78 --> 01:54:39.34
But I'm definitely going to use my strength if needed for really for a couple of reasons.

1805
01:54:39.34 --> 01:54:41.10
The first reason is because of ego.

1806
01:54:41.10 --> 01:54:42.10
Sure.

1807
01:54:42.10 --> 01:54:43.10
Great.

1808
01:54:43.10 --> 01:54:44.10
I don't want to tap.

1809
01:54:44.10 --> 01:54:45.22
I don't want to get caught in a bad position.

1810
01:54:45.22 --> 01:54:46.22
I don't like that.

1811
01:54:46.22 --> 01:54:51.46
You know, if you train, like when we're done training, I'm definitely using strength

1812
01:54:51.46 --> 01:54:52.98
because I'm dripping with sweat.

1813
01:54:52.98 --> 01:54:53.98
Right?

1814
01:54:53.98 --> 01:54:56.46
I mean, I'm using physical attributes.

1815
01:54:56.46 --> 01:54:57.90
But it's not the only reason.

1816
01:54:57.90 --> 01:55:03.66
The other reason that you have to use your strength sometimes is you don't want to give

1817
01:55:03.66 --> 01:55:07.34
people the false sense of security that a that worked.

1818
01:55:07.34 --> 01:55:08.34
Right?

1819
01:55:08.34 --> 01:55:12.30
Even your good training partners, like you don't want to say, oh, the guy gets a position

1820
01:55:12.30 --> 01:55:13.70
so you just tap.

1821
01:55:13.70 --> 01:55:14.70
Right.

1822
01:55:14.70 --> 01:55:16.62
Is it in a competition or in the street?

1823
01:55:16.62 --> 01:55:17.78
The person is not just going to tap.

1824
01:55:17.78 --> 01:55:20.14
They need to do it right.

1825
01:55:20.14 --> 01:55:22.34
So that's it.

1826
01:55:22.34 --> 01:55:28.70
I guess the bottom line is that my guess is this dude is probably using too much strength.

1827
01:55:28.70 --> 01:55:32.70
He's probably one of those guys that's naturally really strong and he works out and he's

1828
01:55:32.70 --> 01:55:34.86
thinking I've been training no ghee for four years.

1829
01:55:34.86 --> 01:55:38.66
So now when I put this ghee on man, I'm angry about it because I'm falling behind a little

1830
01:55:38.66 --> 01:55:39.66
bit.

1831
01:55:39.66 --> 01:55:40.66
So I'm going to use some strength.

1832
01:55:40.66 --> 01:55:41.66
Yeah.

1833
01:55:41.66 --> 01:55:50.82
Try and relax and just one of my favorite pieces of advice to give relax, harger.

1834
01:55:50.82 --> 01:55:51.82
Yeah.

1835
01:55:51.82 --> 01:55:55.82
Just relax, try and flow when you roll a little bit and it definitely will make you it'll

1836
01:55:55.82 --> 01:55:56.82
make you better in the end.

1837
01:55:56.82 --> 01:56:00.98
The more you relax the the the the better you'll get in the end.

1838
01:56:00.98 --> 01:56:01.98
Yeah.

1839
01:56:01.98 --> 01:56:02.98
And certain.

1840
01:56:02.98 --> 01:56:07.98
I found that like certain guys that's just their just their method really.

1841
01:56:07.98 --> 01:56:08.98
Just strong.

1842
01:56:08.98 --> 01:56:09.98
Yeah.

1843
01:56:09.98 --> 01:56:11.62
And that's how they roll and they're just aggressive.

1844
01:56:11.62 --> 01:56:19.06
Physically that's how and I found that they can a lot of times they can get more technical

1845
01:56:19.06 --> 01:56:24.06
you know, but really that's kind of their their strengths in a way and that's it's just

1846
01:56:24.06 --> 01:56:25.06
their way of rolling.

1847
01:56:25.06 --> 01:56:26.06
Yeah.

1848
01:56:26.06 --> 01:56:29.30
You know what now that you mentioned it and some people that are like that they have

1849
01:56:29.30 --> 01:56:30.74
like an on and off switch.

1850
01:56:30.74 --> 01:56:34.86
They're either all on or they're just super docile.

1851
01:56:34.86 --> 01:56:35.86
Yeah.

1852
01:56:35.86 --> 01:56:37.74
It's almost like I got to find that middle ground if you can.

1853
01:56:37.74 --> 01:56:42.74
But people are different like let's say like remember Franklin.

1854
01:56:42.74 --> 01:56:43.74
Yeah.

1855
01:56:43.74 --> 01:56:44.74
He's really flexible.

1856
01:56:44.74 --> 01:56:45.74
Easy.

1857
01:56:45.74 --> 01:56:45.74
Okay.

1858
01:56:45.74 --> 01:56:50.18
Consider him where he's going to be real technical and flexible and flowy and stuff.

1859
01:56:50.18 --> 01:56:51.18
And that's his duty.

1860
01:56:51.18 --> 01:56:52.18
So you can.

1861
01:56:52.18 --> 01:56:54.18
I need to be more strong and rigid and aggressive.

1862
01:56:54.18 --> 01:56:58.98
He can train that but his default is that flowy flexible way.

1863
01:56:58.98 --> 01:57:00.18
And guys are like this.

1864
01:57:00.18 --> 01:57:02.78
I think that's going to be kind of their default.

1865
01:57:02.78 --> 01:57:06.94
They can train kind of deviate a little bit and get it more for sure.

1866
01:57:06.94 --> 01:57:11.10
But that's kind of just their that's that's the vehicle they have.

1867
01:57:11.10 --> 01:57:13.70
You know, and it's almost like a genetic thing.

1868
01:57:13.70 --> 01:57:14.70
It's not genetic.

1869
01:57:14.70 --> 01:57:15.70
I know that.

1870
01:57:15.70 --> 01:57:19.90
But it's kind of it's almost like the foundation of their Franklin was a trip

1871
01:57:19.90 --> 01:57:26.98
to roll with because he was so flexible but not just in a normal way.

1872
01:57:26.98 --> 01:57:28.70
You know what his flexbone is?

1873
01:57:28.70 --> 01:57:30.18
His spine was flexed.

1874
01:57:30.18 --> 01:57:31.18
Yeah.

1875
01:57:31.18 --> 01:57:34.58
Like when you put your weight on him and he would just like like jellyfish.

1876
01:57:34.58 --> 01:57:36.22
Like obviously it was a flex.

1877
01:57:36.22 --> 01:57:37.22
Yeah, I was like an octopus.

1878
01:57:37.22 --> 01:57:38.22
It's exactly what was like.

1879
01:57:38.22 --> 01:57:40.22
Hey, I wish he kept training many.

1880
01:57:40.22 --> 01:57:41.22
Yeah, it's not good.

1881
01:57:41.22 --> 01:57:42.22
It's not too long ago.

1882
01:57:42.22 --> 01:57:43.22
Yeah.

1883
01:57:43.22 --> 01:57:45.22
He's trained it like occasionally.

1884
01:57:45.22 --> 01:57:46.22
Yeah.

1885
01:57:46.22 --> 01:57:47.22
He was getting good for a while.

1886
01:57:47.22 --> 01:57:48.22
Yeah, really.

1887
01:57:48.22 --> 01:57:49.22
It's still good though.

1888
01:57:49.22 --> 01:57:51.22
But yeah, it's kind of.

1889
01:57:51.22 --> 01:57:56.22
There's it's more of a mental thing like if you mentally had there's drills like you can do you

1890
01:57:56.22 --> 01:57:59.22
remember Jerry Loudon was his name.

1891
01:57:59.22 --> 01:58:00.22
Yeah.

1892
01:58:00.22 --> 01:58:01.22
He jumped underneath.

1893
01:58:01.22 --> 01:58:03.22
But we used to do the thing he's like, hey, let's just flow.

1894
01:58:03.22 --> 01:58:04.22
Right.

1895
01:58:04.22 --> 01:58:05.22
And you know how people say let's just flow.

1896
01:58:05.22 --> 01:58:06.22
Then they're trying to kill you.

1897
01:58:06.22 --> 01:58:07.22
Yeah, yeah.

1898
01:58:07.22 --> 01:58:10.94
If he wouldn't though, he would be like his flow would be like a fast piece and you

1899
01:58:10.94 --> 01:58:14.78
could even try to hold them down and he'd just be like flowing flowing flowing flowing

1900
01:58:14.78 --> 01:58:15.78
you'd get you in a good position.

1901
01:58:15.78 --> 01:58:18.78
They need to get right out of it and do another you know like he was really good at

1902
01:58:18.78 --> 01:58:23.58
flowing to the point where you get kind of tired because you're moving so much.

1903
01:58:23.58 --> 01:58:24.90
It's not full speed flow.

1904
01:58:24.90 --> 01:58:26.62
It's almost full speed though.

1905
01:58:26.62 --> 01:58:32.34
So I remember doing that a lot with him and it really translated when I would roll.

1906
01:58:32.34 --> 01:58:35.78
It would be like I felt like that difference in technique.

1907
01:58:35.78 --> 01:58:36.78
Yeah, no, that's really good.

1908
01:58:36.78 --> 01:58:40.94
I do I always do a warm-up run with Andy like that would just go position position.

1909
01:58:40.94 --> 01:58:44.74
But going but we're going like you know we're just going we're flowing.

1910
01:58:44.74 --> 01:58:45.74
Yeah.

1911
01:58:45.74 --> 01:58:46.74
That sounds like that.

1912
01:58:46.74 --> 01:58:47.74
Yeah.

1913
01:58:47.74 --> 01:58:48.74
That's what it is.

1914
01:58:48.74 --> 01:58:49.74
I mean, that's what it is.

1915
01:58:49.74 --> 01:58:51.74
The don't ever do that with Dean.

1916
01:58:51.74 --> 01:58:53.74
No, I'm serious.

1917
01:58:53.74 --> 01:58:54.74
Don't ever.

1918
01:58:54.74 --> 01:59:00.58
You know, don't ever say listen to him say like, hey, let's just get warmed up because

1919
01:59:00.58 --> 01:59:02.06
he's not going to do that.

1920
01:59:02.06 --> 01:59:03.54
He's going to flow until he's in a good position.

1921
01:59:03.54 --> 01:59:04.54
He's going to smash you.

1922
01:59:04.54 --> 01:59:05.54
So don't do it.

1923
01:59:05.54 --> 01:59:06.54
I have to just go hard.

1924
01:59:06.54 --> 01:59:07.54
I know.

1925
01:59:07.54 --> 01:59:08.54
Yeah.

1926
01:59:08.54 --> 01:59:09.54
Good.

1927
01:59:09.54 --> 01:59:10.54
Yeah.

1928
01:59:10.54 --> 01:59:11.54
Yeah.

1929
01:59:11.54 --> 01:59:12.54
And he's real good at that.

1930
01:59:12.54 --> 01:59:13.54
Yeah.

1931
01:59:13.54 --> 01:59:14.54
Yeah.

1932
01:59:14.54 --> 01:59:15.54
Yeah.

1933
01:59:15.54 --> 01:59:16.54
That's a good way.

1934
01:59:16.54 --> 01:59:17.54
That's a good way.

1935
01:59:17.54 --> 01:59:18.54
That's a good way.

1936
01:59:18.54 --> 01:59:19.54
That's a good way if you can.

1937
01:59:19.54 --> 01:59:20.54
That's a good way if you can.

1938
01:59:20.54 --> 01:59:21.54
That's a good way if you can.

1939
01:59:21.54 --> 01:59:22.54
That's a good way if you can.

1940
01:59:22.54 --> 01:59:24.54
That's a good way to learn to relax more.

1941
01:59:24.54 --> 01:59:25.54
Yes.

1942
01:59:25.54 --> 01:59:26.54
Yes.

1943
01:59:26.54 --> 01:59:27.54
Yeah.

1944
01:59:27.54 --> 01:59:28.54
Well, not become some more common because let's face it.

1945
01:59:28.54 --> 01:59:28.54
I mean, if you're strong and you're going into roles and people, if two to the point where

1946
01:59:28.54 --> 01:59:32.18
people are saying, hey, you're using too much strength.

1947
01:59:32.18 --> 01:59:33.78
If you're getting like getting asked for.

1948
01:59:33.78 --> 01:59:37.18
If you're hearing that from multiple people, there's an issue, man.

1949
01:59:37.18 --> 01:59:42.46
That's that my point is even though you're saying, hey, some people are just that way.

1950
01:59:42.46 --> 01:59:43.82
Don't accept that.

1951
01:59:43.82 --> 01:59:48.94
Like the guy that asked this question, don't accept echoes thing of saying some people

1952
01:59:48.94 --> 01:59:50.58
just that way because that means you're just going to keep doing it.

1953
01:59:50.58 --> 01:59:52.86
And you get better because you will.

1954
01:59:52.86 --> 01:59:54.62
The more you relax the better you get.

1955
01:59:54.62 --> 01:59:55.62
Yeah.

1956
01:59:55.62 --> 01:59:56.86
And of course, I don't mean it like that.

1957
01:59:56.86 --> 01:59:57.86
Yeah.

1958
01:59:57.86 --> 01:59:58.86
I know I know you don't.

1959
01:59:58.86 --> 02:00:03.06
But I'm saying, like, don't get that misconception that that's what Echo is trying

1960
02:00:03.06 --> 02:00:04.06
to say.

1961
02:00:04.06 --> 02:00:05.06
Hey, you're just that way.

1962
02:00:05.06 --> 02:00:06.06
Go with it.

1963
02:00:06.06 --> 02:00:07.06
No, don't go with it.

1964
02:00:07.06 --> 02:00:09.34
Listen what Echo is saying when he's saying, hey, find somebody to flow role with and just

1965
02:00:09.34 --> 02:00:10.34
let it flow.

1966
02:00:10.34 --> 02:00:11.34
Yeah.

1967
02:00:11.34 --> 02:00:12.18
It's going to be free of the role.

1968
02:00:12.18 --> 02:00:16.62
You find a person who's kind of default method is this.

1969
02:00:16.62 --> 02:00:21.14
And then by the way, I just realized I don't say flow role because I was thinking about what

1970
02:00:21.14 --> 02:00:22.14
I say to Andy.

1971
02:00:22.14 --> 02:00:23.14
We don't say anymore.

1972
02:00:23.14 --> 02:00:24.14
We just do it.

1973
02:00:24.14 --> 02:00:25.14
But I use you a head.

1974
02:00:25.14 --> 02:00:26.14
Let's get a warm up round.

1975
02:00:26.14 --> 02:00:27.14
I call it warm up.

1976
02:00:27.14 --> 02:00:28.14
Oh, my god.

1977
02:00:28.14 --> 02:00:29.14
Okay.

1978
02:00:29.14 --> 02:00:30.14
Slow roll.

1979
02:00:30.14 --> 02:00:31.14
Yeah.

1980
02:00:31.14 --> 02:00:32.14
But sometimes I don't want them.

1981
02:00:32.14 --> 02:00:34.14
Sometimes just like a technique sharpener.

1982
02:00:34.14 --> 02:00:35.14
Yeah.

1983
02:00:35.14 --> 02:00:36.14
Okay.

1984
02:00:36.14 --> 02:00:37.14
This way.

1985
02:00:37.14 --> 02:00:38.14
And unless it's easy.

1986
02:00:38.14 --> 02:00:40.14
It does do some flow rolling.

1987
02:00:40.14 --> 02:00:42.14
It's drills and gets better at it.

1988
02:00:42.14 --> 02:00:50.26
I would guess that there is going to be a significant remainder of his game.

1989
02:00:50.26 --> 02:00:51.66
That's going to be this aggressive game.

1990
02:00:51.66 --> 02:00:52.66
Oh, I think.

1991
02:00:52.66 --> 02:00:53.66
That's it.

1992
02:00:53.66 --> 02:00:55.06
No, they do still don't get aggressive for sure.

1993
02:00:55.06 --> 02:00:56.06
I know that.

1994
02:00:56.06 --> 02:00:57.06
I'm a little bit aggressive on the map for sure.

1995
02:00:57.06 --> 02:01:02.06
Another little mindset that might help is think less competitively.

1996
02:01:02.06 --> 02:01:04.74
You know how like a lot of people from there.

1997
02:01:04.74 --> 02:01:06.74
And really it's true though.

1998
02:01:06.74 --> 02:01:07.74
Here's the thing.

1999
02:01:07.74 --> 02:01:09.18
This element needs to be there.

2000
02:01:09.18 --> 02:01:13.22
Where it when it's time to to spar, it should be competitive.

2001
02:01:13.22 --> 02:01:15.22
Otherwise it's like what are we doing?

2002
02:01:15.22 --> 02:01:19.22
You know, I want to if I want you to be competitive because I want an accurate look of

2003
02:01:19.22 --> 02:01:22.98
what it's like to roll with juggle or a guy like juggle big, strong, good at you.

2004
02:01:22.98 --> 02:01:23.98
Whatever.

2005
02:01:23.98 --> 02:01:29.14
So, if you're just flow rolling with me and non competitively every single time, I'm

2006
02:01:29.14 --> 02:01:30.54
not getting the work that I need.

2007
02:01:30.54 --> 02:01:34.74
That's what I was talking about earlier too.

2008
02:01:34.74 --> 02:01:36.10
That's why you got parts of strength.

2009
02:01:36.10 --> 02:01:37.90
Yeah, you got to use strength.

2010
02:01:37.90 --> 02:01:38.90
Yeah.

2011
02:01:38.90 --> 02:01:39.90
So, it should be competitive.

2012
02:01:39.90 --> 02:01:42.78
But if some people are complaining, you're going to are you're going straight up like

2013
02:01:42.78 --> 02:01:48.22
every row is ADCC on the line like for death, you know, kind of more in that direct.

2014
02:01:48.22 --> 02:01:49.22
The more jiles.

2015
02:01:49.22 --> 02:01:50.22
Yeah.

2016
02:01:50.22 --> 02:01:54.62
So, if you think maybe less of that, and understand that this is this is training, if

2017
02:01:54.62 --> 02:01:59.06
you want to get less using strength, it's something you got to kind of train that stuff.

2018
02:01:59.06 --> 02:02:00.06
I like it.

2019
02:02:00.06 --> 02:02:01.06
Ultimately.

2020
02:02:01.06 --> 02:02:02.06
Next question.

2021
02:02:02.06 --> 02:02:03.06
Next question.

2022
02:02:03.06 --> 02:02:06.78
Juggle, I need some advice if you've got time.

2023
02:02:06.78 --> 02:02:07.78
We got time.

2024
02:02:07.78 --> 02:02:18.02
What's a good course of action when someone lies, betrays trust or just plain destroys you?

2025
02:02:18.02 --> 02:02:19.02
Move on.

2026
02:02:19.02 --> 02:02:22.78
Straight up, move on.

2027
02:02:22.78 --> 02:02:24.06
Forget them.

2028
02:02:24.06 --> 02:02:29.18
They are lying and they are untrustworthy.

2029
02:02:29.18 --> 02:02:31.42
So, move on.

2030
02:02:31.42 --> 02:02:36.94
Now, sometimes this can be hard, especially if they've somehow tied themselves into your life,

2031
02:02:36.94 --> 02:02:42.78
especially like for instance, you get the kids involved in a divorce scenario.

2032
02:02:42.78 --> 02:02:44.34
You can't move on.

2033
02:02:44.34 --> 02:02:46.66
But you have to mentally move on.

2034
02:02:46.66 --> 02:02:52.02
You have to emotionally detach from that human.

2035
02:02:52.02 --> 02:02:59.78
And that's hard to do because obviously they were someone that you trusted.

2036
02:02:59.78 --> 02:03:02.86
And the reason I know that you trusted them is because they got to a point where they were

2037
02:03:02.86 --> 02:03:06.14
able to betray your trust and destroy you.

2038
02:03:06.14 --> 02:03:10.78
So, it's hard.

2039
02:03:10.78 --> 02:03:16.58
But the fact that you trusted them, the fact that you had that relationship, that's even

2040
02:03:16.58 --> 02:03:19.18
more reason to walk away.

2041
02:03:19.18 --> 02:03:21.74
It's even more reason to move on.

2042
02:03:21.74 --> 02:03:28.54
You've got to see them for what they are.

2043
02:03:28.54 --> 02:03:30.18
And this is an important piece right here.

2044
02:03:30.18 --> 02:03:31.18
This is an important piece.

2045
02:03:31.18 --> 02:03:36.90
This is somebody learned as a young lad out there in the world.

2046
02:03:36.90 --> 02:03:43.22
That person is not who you thought they were.

2047
02:03:43.22 --> 02:03:47.38
Right? They are not who you thought they were.

2048
02:03:47.38 --> 02:03:58.10
The idea that this person was a trustworthy faithful companion is not true.

2049
02:03:58.10 --> 02:03:59.82
It is not true.

2050
02:03:59.82 --> 02:04:02.82
That person does not exist.

2051
02:04:02.82 --> 02:04:04.66
They didn't exist and they don't exist.

2052
02:04:04.66 --> 02:04:05.82
It was in your head.

2053
02:04:05.82 --> 02:04:08.54
It was in your head that this person was trustworthy.

2054
02:04:08.54 --> 02:04:12.42
They were everything you wanted them to be and they were faithful commandant.

2055
02:04:12.42 --> 02:04:13.78
That is a lie.

2056
02:04:13.78 --> 02:04:16.94
They are not that person.

2057
02:04:16.94 --> 02:04:19.58
They have proved it.

2058
02:04:19.58 --> 02:04:22.86
They have proved it by their actions.

2059
02:04:22.86 --> 02:04:32.90
So move on and at the risk of sounding callous, get over it.

2060
02:04:32.90 --> 02:04:34.06
Get over it.

2061
02:04:34.06 --> 02:04:36.06
Do not dwell.

2062
02:04:36.06 --> 02:04:38.06
Do not dwell on.

2063
02:04:38.06 --> 02:04:41.58
Do not dwell on what it was.

2064
02:04:41.58 --> 02:04:44.46
And don't dwell on what it could have been you.

2065
02:04:44.46 --> 02:04:47.22
You and guys go through bad breakups.

2066
02:04:47.22 --> 02:04:50.22
I thought we were going to say no.

2067
02:04:50.22 --> 02:04:51.62
Don't dwell on that.

2068
02:04:51.62 --> 02:04:53.86
Deal with what it is right now.

2069
02:04:53.86 --> 02:04:55.26
What that person is.

2070
02:04:55.26 --> 02:05:01.78
Deal with reality, accept reality and be thankful for reality.

2071
02:05:01.78 --> 02:05:07.78
Be thankful that you were able to learn before you invested more into this person.

2072
02:05:07.78 --> 02:05:13.10
Be thankful that you found out when you did that this person was a liar that this person

2073
02:05:13.10 --> 02:05:15.62
was unfaithful, it's untrustworthy.

2074
02:05:15.62 --> 02:05:21.94
Be thankful that you know it and you know it now instead of later.

2075
02:05:21.94 --> 02:05:25.14
And you know what else is going to make a lot easier to get over these situations is

2076
02:05:25.14 --> 02:05:30.26
recognize that there's plenty of people out there in the world that are trustworthy and

2077
02:05:30.26 --> 02:05:31.26
that are faithful.

2078
02:05:31.26 --> 02:05:32.26
Good people.

2079
02:05:32.26 --> 02:05:33.58
They're out there.

2080
02:05:33.58 --> 02:05:35.82
Go find one of them.

2081
02:05:35.82 --> 02:05:42.30
But don't think that that person that you had was the only one in the world.

2082
02:05:42.30 --> 02:05:43.82
They're not.

2083
02:05:43.82 --> 02:05:44.82
And you know what?

2084
02:05:44.82 --> 02:05:49.46
If that sometimes sometimes people have a hard time making that trust because they're

2085
02:05:49.46 --> 02:05:52.38
so caught up and they don't want to meet someone else right away.

2086
02:05:52.38 --> 02:05:53.82
That's fine.

2087
02:05:53.82 --> 02:05:55.98
Start with yourself.

2088
02:05:55.98 --> 02:05:57.58
Relie on yourself.

2089
02:05:57.58 --> 02:06:04.26
Trust yourself because when someone breaks our trust, we question ourselves too.

2090
02:06:04.26 --> 02:06:06.78
We think, my judgment's bad.

2091
02:06:06.78 --> 02:06:10.58
I'm not a good judge of human character because I totally put my faith in this person and

2092
02:06:10.58 --> 02:06:11.98
look what they did to me.

2093
02:06:11.98 --> 02:06:15.58
So now we don't trust or see you got to build that trust up.

2094
02:06:15.58 --> 02:06:17.98
You got to build that trust up back again with yourself.

2095
02:06:17.98 --> 02:06:18.98
How do you do that?

2096
02:06:18.98 --> 02:06:20.98
Read.

2097
02:06:20.98 --> 02:06:26.42
Write, learn, work out.

2098
02:06:26.42 --> 02:06:27.42
Be alone.

2099
02:06:27.42 --> 02:06:29.58
It's okay to be alone.

2100
02:06:29.58 --> 02:06:31.66
Some people get freaked out when they're alone.

2101
02:06:31.66 --> 02:06:33.06
It's okay to be alone.

2102
02:06:33.06 --> 02:06:34.06
It's okay.

2103
02:06:34.06 --> 02:06:35.06
It's okay to be alone.

2104
02:06:35.06 --> 02:06:36.90
There's no big deal.

2105
02:06:36.90 --> 02:06:38.90
Enjoy it.

2106
02:06:38.90 --> 02:06:42.90
Do something productive and build that trust up in yourself.

2107
02:06:42.90 --> 02:06:44.18
You know, look back at the situation.

2108
02:06:44.18 --> 02:06:45.18
Learn from it.

2109
02:06:45.18 --> 02:06:46.18
We do that.

2110
02:06:46.18 --> 02:06:47.18
It's an off post operational debrief.

2111
02:06:47.18 --> 02:06:48.62
Oh, you've put too much trust in somebody.

2112
02:06:48.62 --> 02:06:49.62
Cool.

2113
02:06:49.62 --> 02:06:50.62
They broke your heart.

2114
02:06:50.62 --> 02:06:51.62
Roger that.

2115
02:06:51.62 --> 02:06:52.62
Let's see what we're to step.

2116
02:06:52.62 --> 02:06:53.62
So what should I have recognized?

2117
02:06:53.62 --> 02:06:57.22
How many times did I say, well, you know, they didn't call me but it's probably just

2118
02:06:57.22 --> 02:06:59.62
because their phone was out of battery.

2119
02:06:59.62 --> 02:07:01.26
No.

2120
02:07:01.26 --> 02:07:02.94
Once your phone runs out of battery once.

2121
02:07:02.94 --> 02:07:04.94
Okay, you don't let it happen again.

2122
02:07:04.94 --> 02:07:05.94
Right?

2123
02:07:05.94 --> 02:07:06.94
So you start seeing those red flags.

2124
02:07:06.94 --> 02:07:08.34
See the mistakes that you made.

2125
02:07:08.34 --> 02:07:13.74
And then look for them next time around because you deal with people all the time that

2126
02:07:13.74 --> 02:07:14.74
they made mistakes.

2127
02:07:14.74 --> 02:07:16.38
The first run.

2128
02:07:16.38 --> 02:07:17.38
They go back.

2129
02:07:17.38 --> 02:07:18.38
They make the same mistakes a second run.

2130
02:07:18.38 --> 02:07:20.30
They go back and make the same mistakes the third run.

2131
02:07:20.30 --> 02:07:25.10
That's when you got to start blaming yourself on your situation.

2132
02:07:25.10 --> 02:07:28.74
That's why that's why I said you got to like build a relationship with yourself.

2133
02:07:28.74 --> 02:07:29.74
You got to learn yourself.

2134
02:07:29.74 --> 02:07:30.74
You got to trust.

2135
02:07:30.74 --> 02:07:33.62
You got to learn to trust yourself.

2136
02:07:33.62 --> 02:07:35.74
So spend some time doing that.

2137
02:07:35.74 --> 02:07:41.02
And then when you go back and you start dealing with people because that's what you're

2138
02:07:41.02 --> 02:07:43.82
going to watch out for is that you become a hard criminal.

2139
02:07:43.82 --> 02:07:44.82
You don't trust anybody.

2140
02:07:44.82 --> 02:07:47.22
Like you were talking about cops.

2141
02:07:47.22 --> 02:07:50.30
You know, sometimes cops have a hard time because they're dealing with scumbags all

2142
02:07:50.30 --> 02:07:51.30
day long.

2143
02:07:51.30 --> 02:07:52.30
Right.

2144
02:07:52.30 --> 02:07:56.06
And it builds up this mistrust of other people.

2145
02:07:56.06 --> 02:07:58.46
So you don't want to have that happen.

2146
02:07:58.46 --> 02:08:02.10
You want to be suspicious of people, but you want to be able to build trust once they

2147
02:08:02.10 --> 02:08:03.10
prove themselves.

2148
02:08:03.10 --> 02:08:08.14
So take those small steps and start to build up over time.

2149
02:08:08.14 --> 02:08:10.66
Go just jump in and give someone 100% trust out of the gate.

2150
02:08:10.66 --> 02:08:11.66
You don't know them.

2151
02:08:11.66 --> 02:08:12.86
You don't know them.

2152
02:08:12.86 --> 02:08:17.98
You know, back in the day, back in the day with old hardcore bands, you have this

2153
02:08:17.98 --> 02:08:22.14
teacher that just said trust no one was like, yeah, that's legit.

2154
02:08:22.14 --> 02:08:27.10
You don't go out of the gate with the big trust on somebody with important stuff.

2155
02:08:27.10 --> 02:08:28.42
Don't do it.

2156
02:08:28.42 --> 02:08:33.14
The good news is like I said, there's plenty of people out there that are good people

2157
02:08:33.14 --> 02:08:37.10
that you can give all your trust to.

2158
02:08:37.10 --> 02:08:38.94
Just take it slow, brother.

2159
02:08:38.94 --> 02:08:39.94
Yeah.

2160
02:08:39.94 --> 02:08:43.34
And it's so crazy how you just explained that so simple.

2161
02:08:43.34 --> 02:08:49.50
And it makes total sense when you're in the situation though, you know, like you can't

2162
02:08:49.50 --> 02:08:54.02
just detach and be like, what are the red flags that it's all you're too busy missing

2163
02:08:54.02 --> 02:08:56.50
the person or whatever your disaster.

2164
02:08:56.50 --> 02:09:04.30
So, and then I guess, but even though it's throwing things and looking at pictures, that's

2165
02:09:04.30 --> 02:09:05.30
the worst.

2166
02:09:05.30 --> 02:09:06.74
You should get out the picture and stare.

2167
02:09:06.74 --> 02:09:08.34
I've seen guys do that on my bro.

2168
02:09:08.34 --> 02:09:09.34
Give me that.

2169
02:09:09.34 --> 02:09:10.34
Let me fill this away for you.

2170
02:09:10.34 --> 02:09:11.34
It's not going to help.

2171
02:09:11.34 --> 02:09:17.74
The person who, that was always to me was was explaining like, listen, because guys, what

2172
02:09:17.74 --> 02:09:21.70
she was, no, no, she wasn't.

2173
02:09:21.70 --> 02:09:22.78
That is a lie.

2174
02:09:22.78 --> 02:09:27.06
That person that you put together in your head that you've assembled in your mind, that

2175
02:09:27.06 --> 02:09:28.78
person doesn't exist.

2176
02:09:28.78 --> 02:09:30.58
They don't exist.

2177
02:09:30.58 --> 02:09:34.14
The person that you dealt with was a liar.

2178
02:09:34.14 --> 02:09:36.14
Was unfaithful, was a cheater.

2179
02:09:36.14 --> 02:09:37.34
That's the person.

2180
02:09:37.34 --> 02:09:40.46
The person wasn't this person that you're putting forth in your mind.

2181
02:09:40.46 --> 02:09:41.94
That person doesn't exist.

2182
02:09:41.94 --> 02:09:42.94
So stop.

2183
02:09:42.94 --> 02:09:44.94
But you don't understand the good time.

2184
02:09:44.94 --> 02:09:45.94
Yeah.

2185
02:09:45.94 --> 02:09:46.94
I don't know.

2186
02:09:46.94 --> 02:09:47.94
Here's the trick.

2187
02:09:47.94 --> 02:09:48.94
Okay.

2188
02:09:48.94 --> 02:09:53.38
That person will lie at that person's cheater.

2189
02:09:53.38 --> 02:09:55.38
What I kind of said there was, look, you don't understand the good time.

2190
02:09:55.38 --> 02:09:56.38
That's a real part of it.

2191
02:09:56.38 --> 02:09:57.38
For sure.

2192
02:09:57.38 --> 02:10:02.38
It's like sure they did the sure she flats my tires when she gets measure all that.

2193
02:10:02.38 --> 02:10:04.38
But the good times we have are so good.

2194
02:10:04.38 --> 02:10:08.78
It's proof that it's not about the person.

2195
02:10:08.78 --> 02:10:11.78
It's not about the person that you can see all the red flags and how they mistreat

2196
02:10:11.78 --> 02:10:14.02
you from time to time or that you're beecher.

2197
02:10:14.02 --> 02:10:18.42
It's about yourself and how you're sad now because of all these reasons.

2198
02:10:18.42 --> 02:10:20.14
The trick comes with what?

2199
02:10:20.14 --> 02:10:24.18
One of the tricks come with the same thing I said about drinking where it's your brain.

2200
02:10:24.18 --> 02:10:27.78
Because it's like chemicals when you bond with someone in certain ways and it's different

2201
02:10:27.78 --> 02:10:29.86
from, you know, it varies from person to person.

2202
02:10:29.86 --> 02:10:35.98
But it's like, I think it's like oxytocin or something where it's, it's basically something

2203
02:10:35.98 --> 02:10:40.10
that's what I'm going to, but you feel this bond with this specific person.

2204
02:10:40.10 --> 02:10:42.98
That's why you have these feelings that even though this girl liked lies to you, you

2205
02:10:42.98 --> 02:10:45.94
see her lying text message is on your phone right now.

2206
02:10:45.94 --> 02:10:48.42
You're looking at, you mean why you still miss them.

2207
02:10:48.42 --> 02:10:53.78
It's a trick because it's saying that you're emotional like well being is attached to this

2208
02:10:53.78 --> 02:10:55.18
person kind of thing.

2209
02:10:55.18 --> 02:10:56.78
And all the other stuff you just ignore.

2210
02:10:56.78 --> 02:11:02.98
So just like I was saying with drinking, why no consciously, like I'm going to be hung

2211
02:11:02.98 --> 02:11:03.98
over tomorrow.

2212
02:11:03.98 --> 02:11:04.98
I won't get anything done.

2213
02:11:04.98 --> 02:11:05.98
All this stuff.

2214
02:11:05.98 --> 02:11:08.18
But why do I want to drink so bad right now?

2215
02:11:08.18 --> 02:11:09.18
Kind of thing?

2216
02:11:09.18 --> 02:11:11.06
And it's the same thing.

2217
02:11:11.06 --> 02:11:15.78
The chemicals in your brain are telling you this girl is essential for you.

2218
02:11:15.78 --> 02:11:16.78
For your well being.

2219
02:11:16.78 --> 02:11:17.78
She's not.

2220
02:11:17.78 --> 02:11:18.78
Yeah.

2221
02:11:18.78 --> 02:11:19.78
Oh, that's a magic.

2222
02:11:19.78 --> 02:11:20.78
That's a trick.

2223
02:11:20.78 --> 02:11:21.78
Don't listen to your brain.

2224
02:11:21.78 --> 02:11:22.78
Listen to me.

2225
02:11:22.78 --> 02:11:23.78
That's not essential.

2226
02:11:23.78 --> 02:11:24.78
That's what you've all.

2227
02:11:24.78 --> 02:11:26.78
I'm telling you, but that's the logic.

2228
02:11:26.78 --> 02:11:29.06
Which those chemicals blocking.

2229
02:11:29.06 --> 02:11:36.66
I have seen so many situations where guys are just in what's horrible is I'm sitting

2230
02:11:36.66 --> 02:11:37.66
here saying this.

2231
02:11:37.66 --> 02:11:41.86
It's, you could be smacking someone in the face telling a move on and they're not going

2232
02:11:41.86 --> 02:11:42.86
to listen.

2233
02:11:42.86 --> 02:11:43.86
That's what that's all about.

2234
02:11:43.86 --> 02:11:44.86
So you got to make that decision.

2235
02:11:44.86 --> 02:11:46.86
That's, that's, that's, it's hard.

2236
02:11:46.86 --> 02:11:47.86
And guys ruin their lives.

2237
02:11:47.86 --> 02:11:48.86
I mean, you guys do too.

2238
02:11:48.86 --> 02:11:51.86
Girls and guys, they ruin their lives.

2239
02:11:51.86 --> 02:11:57.10
You know, with over somebody that is completely abusive whether mentally or physically,

2240
02:11:57.10 --> 02:12:00.86
they're just completely abusive and they ruin their lives for this person.

2241
02:12:00.86 --> 02:12:01.86
That person.

2242
02:12:01.86 --> 02:12:05.86
And seeing my mind, I think it's because they build a person.

2243
02:12:05.86 --> 02:12:09.30
They build a person on the framework of reality.

2244
02:12:09.30 --> 02:12:10.70
They build a fantasy.

2245
02:12:10.70 --> 02:12:12.94
And they're in love with that fantasy.

2246
02:12:12.94 --> 02:12:14.82
And they want to keep it going.

2247
02:12:14.82 --> 02:12:15.82
It's a fantasy.

2248
02:12:15.82 --> 02:12:17.26
So stop and they get away.

2249
02:12:17.26 --> 02:12:19.78
And they ignore like all the corner for red flags.

2250
02:12:19.78 --> 02:12:21.38
And they remember the good times.

2251
02:12:21.38 --> 02:12:24.26
Even if it's like like 10 minutes a week.

2252
02:12:24.26 --> 02:12:25.50
They remember those good times.

2253
02:12:25.50 --> 02:12:32.06
They ignore the red flags because of that, that, you know, that trick, that chemical

2254
02:12:32.06 --> 02:12:33.42
trick in their brain.

2255
02:12:33.42 --> 02:12:36.50
And so it reinforces that thing that they built.

2256
02:12:36.50 --> 02:12:37.74
You know, that fantasy that they build.

2257
02:12:37.74 --> 02:12:38.74
It's true.

2258
02:12:38.74 --> 02:12:39.74
It's this big.

2259
02:12:39.74 --> 02:12:41.46
The reality is this big.

2260
02:12:41.46 --> 02:12:42.46
And look, the fantasy.

2261
02:12:42.46 --> 02:12:44.06
And they just attached to it.

2262
02:12:44.06 --> 02:12:48.98
You ever see a friend or whatever because I'm assuming you've never been in this situation.

2263
02:12:48.98 --> 02:12:51.82
Like you ever had a friend where they're really into it.

2264
02:12:51.82 --> 02:12:52.94
They're almost ruining their lives.

2265
02:12:52.94 --> 02:12:54.14
They're in bad shape or whatever.

2266
02:12:54.14 --> 02:12:57.82
And then whether it be all of a sudden or years later, whatever, they're thinking back

2267
02:12:57.82 --> 02:13:03.10
and they're like, wow, is I think because the chemical trick, so to speak, where

2268
02:13:03.10 --> 02:13:04.10
you're off.

2269
02:13:04.10 --> 02:13:06.10
And then they can see all that logic that you're talking about.

2270
02:13:06.10 --> 02:13:08.38
And like, oh my gosh, man.

2271
02:13:08.38 --> 02:13:13.70
It's almost like you feel like you were a different person.

2272
02:13:13.70 --> 02:13:14.70
You recover.

2273
02:13:14.70 --> 02:13:15.70
You can't talk.

2274
02:13:15.70 --> 02:13:18.38
And they just the fact that you can't talk any sense into people and they're in that

2275
02:13:18.38 --> 02:13:19.38
situation.

2276
02:13:19.38 --> 02:13:20.38
Is it trick?

2277
02:13:20.38 --> 02:13:22.74
You gotta try and, yeah, it's hard.

2278
02:13:22.74 --> 02:13:26.94
But I think knowing that that's it, it's a chemical in your brain that is tricking

2279
02:13:26.94 --> 02:13:27.94
you.

2280
02:13:27.94 --> 02:13:28.94
And it goes for a lot of stuff.

2281
02:13:28.94 --> 02:13:29.94
Don't not.

2282
02:13:29.94 --> 02:13:31.70
It's like all this that's tricking you.

2283
02:13:31.70 --> 02:13:34.30
If you know like, hey, and you say, I'm not going to be tricked.

2284
02:13:34.30 --> 02:13:35.30
I feel it.

2285
02:13:35.30 --> 02:13:36.66
I feel this that I feel the sadness.

2286
02:13:36.66 --> 02:13:38.38
I feel missing this person.

2287
02:13:38.38 --> 02:13:39.78
But it's a trick, you know?

2288
02:13:39.78 --> 02:13:40.78
Yeah.

2289
02:13:40.78 --> 02:13:41.78
That helps.

2290
02:13:41.78 --> 02:13:42.78
Totally helps.

2291
02:13:42.78 --> 02:13:43.78
Like it.

2292
02:13:43.78 --> 02:13:47.26
So move on, man.

2293
02:13:47.26 --> 02:13:48.70
I know it's hard.

2294
02:13:48.70 --> 02:13:49.70
Trust us.

2295
02:13:49.70 --> 02:13:50.70
Speaking of moving on.

2296
02:13:50.70 --> 02:13:53.70
Next question.

2297
02:13:53.70 --> 02:13:56.06
Unless we want to talk about this more.

2298
02:13:56.06 --> 02:13:57.78
No, I think you're going to move on.

2299
02:13:57.78 --> 02:13:58.78
Okay.

2300
02:13:58.78 --> 02:13:59.78
Exactly, right?

2301
02:13:59.78 --> 02:14:02.30
Let's move on.

2302
02:14:02.30 --> 02:14:04.30
In what circumstances do you recommend direct?

2303
02:14:04.30 --> 02:14:05.78
Yes, I will hold on.

2304
02:14:05.78 --> 02:14:06.78
Oh, and I'll move you.

2305
02:14:06.78 --> 02:14:07.78
You stuck on it.

2306
02:14:07.78 --> 02:14:12.74
No, but what's horrible is, man, people kill themselves in these situations.

2307
02:14:12.74 --> 02:14:13.74
Yes, over a lie.

2308
02:14:13.74 --> 02:14:14.74
Yeah.

2309
02:14:14.74 --> 02:14:15.74
That's that's a metric.

2310
02:14:15.74 --> 02:14:16.74
The trick.

2311
02:14:16.74 --> 02:14:18.74
But it's a lie.

2312
02:14:18.74 --> 02:14:24.98
And guys or girls get so distraught over this fantasy that doesn't exist.

2313
02:14:24.98 --> 02:14:29.74
And what's really jacked up is if they could just move on, they'd find a reality

2314
02:14:29.74 --> 02:14:32.58
that was actually congruent with what their desires are.

2315
02:14:32.58 --> 02:14:33.58
It's out there.

2316
02:14:33.58 --> 02:14:34.58
Yeah.

2317
02:14:34.58 --> 02:14:35.58
You can see people all over the world.

2318
02:14:35.58 --> 02:14:38.10
They're in relationships.

2319
02:14:38.10 --> 02:14:40.42
Having fun from every level.

2320
02:14:40.42 --> 02:14:41.42
Right?

2321
02:14:41.42 --> 02:14:42.42
Yeah.

2322
02:14:42.42 --> 02:14:48.74
But you get caught up in this mental trap and obsessing over a fantasy.

2323
02:14:48.74 --> 02:14:49.74
It's a fantasy.

2324
02:14:49.74 --> 02:14:53.38
Don't obsess over the fantasy, man.

2325
02:14:53.38 --> 02:14:56.06
There's you can get over it.

2326
02:14:56.06 --> 02:14:59.18
And there's plenty of other human beings out there that are awesome.

2327
02:14:59.18 --> 02:15:01.06
So go find one of them.

2328
02:15:01.06 --> 02:15:04.42
And in the meantime, hang out with your badass self.

2329
02:15:04.42 --> 02:15:05.42
Right?

2330
02:15:05.42 --> 02:15:06.42
Become a better person.

2331
02:15:06.42 --> 02:15:08.42
Man, working out is a big one.

2332
02:15:08.42 --> 02:15:09.42
For you.

2333
02:15:09.42 --> 02:15:10.42
For sure.

2334
02:15:10.42 --> 02:15:12.22
That's the 100%.

2335
02:15:12.22 --> 02:15:14.38
Just get in the gym and get after it.

2336
02:15:14.38 --> 02:15:15.78
Do you do yourselves everything?

2337
02:15:15.78 --> 02:15:16.78
Yes.

2338
02:15:16.78 --> 02:15:19.22
Lifting solves every leg.

2339
02:15:19.22 --> 02:15:20.22
Okay.

2340
02:15:20.22 --> 02:15:25.62
So what circumstances do you recommend direct to tech in combination with indirect?

2341
02:15:25.62 --> 02:15:26.62
If any?

2342
02:15:26.62 --> 02:15:28.14
Or do you have any examples?

2343
02:15:28.14 --> 02:15:29.14
Yeah.

2344
02:15:29.14 --> 02:15:30.62
So we talk about flanking all the time.

2345
02:15:30.62 --> 02:15:32.98
I always recommend a combined attack.

2346
02:15:32.98 --> 02:15:33.98
Right?

2347
02:15:33.98 --> 02:15:37.18
If you only attack the flank, well, then the enemy is going to adjust the nigger for all

2348
02:15:37.18 --> 02:15:38.18
the defenses there.

2349
02:15:38.18 --> 02:15:39.18
Now it's not flanking anymore.

2350
02:15:39.18 --> 02:15:40.18
Now it's the front.

2351
02:15:40.18 --> 02:15:47.22
So you need to fain attack or at least you need to attack with some minor level of force

2352
02:15:47.22 --> 02:15:50.70
directly so that the enemy has to defend what you're doing.

2353
02:15:50.70 --> 02:15:56.94
And I mean, clearly when we're examples are pretty easy to come up with when we're

2354
02:15:56.94 --> 02:16:01.70
doing raids like assaults on buildings, you're going to attack that building from multiple

2355
02:16:01.70 --> 02:16:03.10
directions.

2356
02:16:03.10 --> 02:16:08.06
At a minimum, at least you're going to set distractions on some of the other directions.

2357
02:16:08.06 --> 02:16:10.30
And the same thing we were setting up over watches.

2358
02:16:10.30 --> 02:16:14.14
Yeah, we're going to have a lot of times we'd have a main overwatch and we'd have a little

2359
02:16:14.14 --> 02:16:15.42
flanker overwatch.

2360
02:16:15.42 --> 02:16:18.02
So when you come to get us, you're going to pay.

2361
02:16:18.02 --> 02:16:22.94
And like a classic L shaped assault.

2362
02:16:22.94 --> 02:16:27.38
There's a reason it's called an L shaped shaped like an L you have a, you have a fire, a

2363
02:16:27.38 --> 02:16:32.10
base position that's going to put down fire on the target and you have from the new

2364
02:16:32.10 --> 02:16:37.94
element that's going to come in from the flank, but even with that, you, you have to do a base

2365
02:16:37.94 --> 02:16:39.10
element and a maneuver element.

2366
02:16:39.10 --> 02:16:44.62
There's a reason because you're going to, the base is going to put down fire and then

2367
02:16:44.62 --> 02:16:45.94
the maneuver is going to maneuver it.

2368
02:16:45.94 --> 02:16:49.62
So yes, those are clearly some of them.

2369
02:16:49.62 --> 02:16:50.62
It's the same thing.

2370
02:16:50.62 --> 02:16:53.46
Yes, it's the same thing in the business environment, right?

2371
02:16:53.46 --> 02:17:00.90
In the business environment, if you're going to maneuver into a new market, you don't just

2372
02:17:00.90 --> 02:17:02.58
walk away from your other market, right?

2373
02:17:02.58 --> 02:17:05.66
You don't, if you're going to develop a new product, you don't throw away your old

2374
02:17:05.66 --> 02:17:07.74
product, no, you keep, that's your base.

2375
02:17:07.74 --> 02:17:10.50
You keep that going and then you flank.

2376
02:17:10.50 --> 02:17:12.90
So it makes sense there.

2377
02:17:12.90 --> 02:17:20.78
Yeah, so absolutely when you're going to attack, attack from both directions.

2378
02:17:20.78 --> 02:17:32.22
And in fact, I do that most of the time.

2379
02:17:32.22 --> 02:17:33.58
This actually isn't really a question.

2380
02:17:33.58 --> 02:17:35.02
It's more of a comment.

2381
02:17:35.02 --> 02:17:37.18
Yeah, I kind of perturbed it into a question.

2382
02:17:37.18 --> 02:17:39.62
Yeah, you responded to the comment.

2383
02:17:39.62 --> 02:17:40.62
Okay.

2384
02:17:40.62 --> 02:17:41.62
Sure.

2385
02:17:41.62 --> 02:17:42.62
You know, it's coming.

2386
02:17:42.62 --> 02:17:43.90
Just want to say quick thanks.

2387
02:17:43.90 --> 02:17:50.74
I struggle with the daily grind, trading days for dollars, but you help me make it happen.

2388
02:17:50.74 --> 02:17:54.34
Yeah, and my comment was like, okay, well, thank you.

2389
02:17:54.34 --> 02:18:02.94
I guess because I hope at the same time that you're grinding, that you're trading, that

2390
02:18:02.94 --> 02:18:08.50
you're, I hope that you're not trading days for dollars long term because long term,

2391
02:18:08.50 --> 02:18:11.70
that's a losing proposition, right?

2392
02:18:11.70 --> 02:18:17.70
If you're grinding and it's not doing something you want to do if it's a grind that

2393
02:18:17.70 --> 02:18:23.50
you can't embrace, then you've got to find a way out of that, right?

2394
02:18:23.50 --> 02:18:25.18
You've got to find, you can't trade.

2395
02:18:25.18 --> 02:18:28.38
You don't want to trade days for dollars because dollars don't mean anything.

2396
02:18:28.38 --> 02:18:30.70
Days all you got.

2397
02:18:30.70 --> 02:18:33.78
So you've got to find a way out.

2398
02:18:33.78 --> 02:18:37.54
Now this does not mean you need to be rash about it.

2399
02:18:37.54 --> 02:18:39.18
This doesn't mean tomorrow you walk in.

2400
02:18:39.18 --> 02:18:40.58
I'm not doing this job anymore.

2401
02:18:40.58 --> 02:18:41.58
I'm out.

2402
02:18:41.58 --> 02:18:42.58
And now you're broke.

2403
02:18:42.58 --> 02:18:43.58
No.

2404
02:18:43.58 --> 02:18:47.46
Don't be rash and don't throw the baby out with the bath water.

2405
02:18:47.46 --> 02:18:52.50
You don't do come up with a long term plan about what you want to do, how you want to do it,

2406
02:18:52.50 --> 02:18:54.18
where you want to do it.

2407
02:18:54.18 --> 02:18:58.74
And this might take one year or two years or five years.

2408
02:18:58.74 --> 02:19:02.46
It might take five years to get to where you want to be.

2409
02:19:02.46 --> 02:19:03.46
That's okay.

2410
02:19:03.46 --> 02:19:04.46
That's fine.

2411
02:19:04.46 --> 02:19:06.90
It's actually kind of cool.

2412
02:19:06.90 --> 02:19:09.30
When you're grinding right now because you know there's something that you're working

2413
02:19:09.30 --> 02:19:13.26
towards in the long run, that's actually awesome.

2414
02:19:13.26 --> 02:19:17.22
But you've got to have an exit strategy.

2415
02:19:17.22 --> 02:19:19.50
You've got to have an exit strategy.

2416
02:19:19.50 --> 02:19:22.22
You've got to plan and figure out how much money it's going to take and what are you going

2417
02:19:22.22 --> 02:19:23.22
to do?

2418
02:19:23.22 --> 02:19:24.22
You're going to work two jobs.

2419
02:19:24.22 --> 02:19:25.22
I'm going to save all my money right now.

2420
02:19:25.22 --> 02:19:26.22
I'm going to invest here.

2421
02:19:26.22 --> 02:19:27.22
You're going to pay off my mortgage.

2422
02:19:27.22 --> 02:19:32.82
Whatever you're going to do so that you can get yourself in a position where you actually

2423
02:19:32.82 --> 02:19:34.46
enjoy doing what you're doing.

2424
02:19:34.46 --> 02:19:36.74
That's what you want.

2425
02:19:36.74 --> 02:19:42.98
And the one other cool thing about this is like a seven.

2426
02:19:42.98 --> 02:19:44.34
It's cool to grind.

2427
02:19:44.34 --> 02:19:45.98
That's what we're here to do.

2428
02:19:45.98 --> 02:19:47.98
You're here doing stuff.

2429
02:19:47.98 --> 02:19:50.98
If you're not doing anything, well then what are you doing?

2430
02:19:50.98 --> 02:19:58.14
So the other thing that's cool though about grinding and working is that when you get

2431
02:19:58.14 --> 02:20:02.30
that freedom, that you work hard for, it's going to be so much more worth it.

2432
02:20:02.30 --> 02:20:06.82
The discipline that you put into place to get to that freedom that you want, it makes

2433
02:20:06.82 --> 02:20:09.90
that freedom so much more worth it.

2434
02:20:09.90 --> 02:20:12.66
So I appreciate it.

2435
02:20:12.66 --> 02:20:14.06
I'm glad you're grinding.

2436
02:20:14.06 --> 02:20:17.14
I'm glad you're grinding hard, but don't just make that trade.

2437
02:20:17.14 --> 02:20:20.74
It's not a square trade days for dollars, not a square trade.

2438
02:20:20.74 --> 02:20:22.50
Get it back under your control.

2439
02:20:22.50 --> 02:20:26.54
And we've had some really cool feedback on the podcast of people that have hit me up and

2440
02:20:26.54 --> 02:20:29.94
said, hey, you told me to plan an extra strategy.

2441
02:20:29.94 --> 02:20:30.94
I wish I could find this.

2442
02:20:30.94 --> 02:20:33.38
The guy said, you told me to plan an extra strategy.

2443
02:20:33.38 --> 02:20:35.82
He's like, that was whatever nine months ago.

2444
02:20:35.82 --> 02:20:36.82
I saved my money.

2445
02:20:36.82 --> 02:20:37.82
I just did this.

2446
02:20:37.82 --> 02:20:38.82
Now I'm in another business.

2447
02:20:38.82 --> 02:20:39.82
I'm kicking ass.

2448
02:20:39.82 --> 02:20:40.82
Thank you.

2449
02:20:40.82 --> 02:20:41.82
Right?

2450
02:20:41.82 --> 02:20:42.82
So it can be done.

2451
02:20:42.82 --> 02:20:46.54
It's one of the things about cool about being a human being.

2452
02:20:46.54 --> 02:20:47.54
You got free will.

2453
02:20:47.54 --> 02:20:48.54
You can make stuff happen.

2454
02:20:48.54 --> 02:20:49.54
Yeah.

2455
02:20:49.54 --> 02:20:50.54
Let's go make it happen.

2456
02:20:50.54 --> 02:20:51.54
No man.

2457
02:20:51.54 --> 02:20:54.94
And there's a lot of tricks there too.

2458
02:20:54.94 --> 02:21:00.74
Where, you know, the disc hyperbolic disc counting when you basically go for the

2459
02:21:00.74 --> 02:21:07.06
short term payoff in the expense of the long term payoff.

2460
02:21:07.06 --> 02:21:11.18
So let's say you have an exit strategy for five years.

2461
02:21:11.18 --> 02:21:16.30
It helps actually, this is like for real help night and night where if you look at that

2462
02:21:16.30 --> 02:21:20.46
end exit strategy as like a, you know, a goal or whatever.

2463
02:21:20.46 --> 02:21:24.30
And the time in between now and then is preparation time.

2464
02:21:24.30 --> 02:21:25.74
That's all that is like prop.

2465
02:21:25.74 --> 02:21:29.86
So a lot of times like I remember when I was working at the nightclub, that was a full

2466
02:21:29.86 --> 02:21:32.82
on like, oh, and I could have called job all short term payoff stuff.

2467
02:21:32.82 --> 02:21:35.18
Living kind of day to day week to week.

2468
02:21:35.18 --> 02:21:36.18
I get my paycheck.

2469
02:21:36.18 --> 02:21:37.50
I go hang out.

2470
02:21:37.50 --> 02:21:38.50
Go work.

2471
02:21:38.50 --> 02:21:39.50
Pay check hang out.

2472
02:21:39.50 --> 02:21:40.50
So it's all just short term payoff.

2473
02:21:40.50 --> 02:21:42.98
So I was in there for years.

2474
02:21:42.98 --> 02:21:43.98
How many years?

2475
02:21:43.98 --> 02:21:44.98
Seven.

2476
02:21:44.98 --> 02:21:46.62
So I'm in no six.

2477
02:21:46.62 --> 02:21:48.62
I was at the end of like almost seven.

2478
02:21:48.62 --> 02:21:49.94
So yeah, nightclub.

2479
02:21:49.94 --> 02:21:56.10
So I remember thinking when I was like over at or at a, I remember thinking, I feel like

2480
02:21:56.10 --> 02:21:57.10
I wasted a lot of years.

2481
02:21:57.10 --> 02:22:00.66
I think back now, I didn't because I learned a lot of psychological stuff.

2482
02:22:00.66 --> 02:22:06.70
But I remember like reflecting and being like man, I spent, and yeah, I went to college

2483
02:22:06.70 --> 02:22:09.54
all this stuff, really slack through college, I spent the same way.

2484
02:22:09.54 --> 02:22:12.10
I just like, okay, I'll take this class as I may or may or may not pass it.

2485
02:22:12.10 --> 02:22:13.10
Whatever.

2486
02:22:13.10 --> 02:22:16.02
I want to work, I work on be cool, whatever.

2487
02:22:16.02 --> 02:22:21.90
And I reflect and I think dang, I spent my life preparing for nothing really consciously.

2488
02:22:21.90 --> 02:22:26.66
I mean, passively I did because I liked certain creative things and that, you know, materialized

2489
02:22:26.66 --> 02:22:31.14
for sure, but actively, like consciously, I was never, you know, I was certain people

2490
02:22:31.14 --> 02:22:33.30
they're like, I want to be at architect for sure.

2491
02:22:33.30 --> 02:22:34.30
And that's it.

2492
02:22:34.30 --> 02:22:35.30
And I'm doing it.

2493
02:22:35.30 --> 02:22:37.78
And I know a lot of times if there's family history and certain things is like, they

2494
02:22:37.78 --> 02:22:42.46
know, you know, and they wind up doing it a lot of times.

2495
02:22:42.46 --> 02:22:45.42
But I reflected in thought, man, I'm here.

2496
02:22:45.42 --> 02:22:49.22
I spent my life up to this point preparing for nothing in life.

2497
02:22:49.22 --> 02:22:51.86
I know about working out, that's it.

2498
02:22:51.86 --> 02:22:58.10
So a lot of times when you're making your, you find yourself in a grind that without, like,

2499
02:22:58.10 --> 02:23:01.58
a exit strategy or something like that, a lot of times that will be the case.

2500
02:23:01.58 --> 02:23:04.74
Like, I spent my life kind of preparing for nothing really.

2501
02:23:04.74 --> 02:23:06.66
But that's the good thing how you're saying.

2502
02:23:06.66 --> 02:23:10.14
You can take a year, you can take two years, five years, whatever, start preparing for

2503
02:23:10.14 --> 02:23:11.34
that five years.

2504
02:23:11.34 --> 02:23:14.42
And at the end, when the five years comes, you are prepared straight up.

2505
02:23:14.42 --> 02:23:18.10
If you spend one year doing something, focus, like, hey, I got to get, could even

2506
02:23:18.10 --> 02:23:19.42
something like, I'm going to play the piano.

2507
02:23:19.42 --> 02:23:20.66
I don't know anything.

2508
02:23:20.66 --> 02:23:21.66
Bowen arrow.

2509
02:23:21.66 --> 02:23:22.66
I don't know.

2510
02:23:22.66 --> 02:23:23.90
You spend one year focused on it.

2511
02:23:23.90 --> 02:23:25.58
At the end of the year, you can be pretty prepared.

2512
02:23:25.58 --> 02:23:26.58
Yeah.

2513
02:23:26.58 --> 02:23:27.58
Compared to the average person.

2514
02:23:27.58 --> 02:23:31.38
So you spend like two years, five years preparing whatever that exit strategy is.

2515
02:23:31.38 --> 02:23:35.90
And you're for a prepared spend look at that time as this is preparation time.

2516
02:23:35.90 --> 02:23:36.90
Yeah.

2517
02:23:36.90 --> 02:23:46.94
And it's, if only somebody comes up to you, you've been working at the night club for a year

2518
02:23:46.94 --> 02:23:50.34
and says, hey, echo, what are you going to do with your life?

2519
02:23:50.34 --> 02:23:55.66
And you're like, well, you would immediately say, well, let me phrase that another way.

2520
02:23:55.66 --> 02:24:00.34
Echo, are you planning to be a night club bouncer for the next 25 years?

2521
02:24:00.34 --> 02:24:01.94
Your answer would clearly be no.

2522
02:24:01.94 --> 02:24:02.94
Okay.

2523
02:24:02.94 --> 02:24:03.94
So what are you getting ready for?

2524
02:24:03.94 --> 02:24:04.94
Yeah.

2525
02:24:04.94 --> 02:24:10.66
Sometimes this person is aware that they're in a grind.

2526
02:24:10.66 --> 02:24:16.78
A lot of times people don't even realize that what they're doing, that they're, they're, they're

2527
02:24:16.78 --> 02:24:18.42
marking time is what we call the military.

2528
02:24:18.42 --> 02:24:20.42
You're marching, but you're not going anywhere.

2529
02:24:20.42 --> 02:24:21.42
Yeah.

2530
02:24:21.42 --> 02:24:22.42
You're feeling weird up and down.

2531
02:24:22.42 --> 02:24:23.74
You're spinning your wheels.

2532
02:24:23.74 --> 02:24:27.34
So think about that's a great point that you just made is what, what were you preparing

2533
02:24:27.34 --> 02:24:28.34
for?

2534
02:24:28.34 --> 02:24:31.98
If you would have been learned to play the piano, boom, you could be in the game right now.

2535
02:24:31.98 --> 02:24:33.18
Right now, yeah.

2536
02:24:33.18 --> 02:24:37.18
But so that's an important thing, especially when you start talking to people that are

2537
02:24:37.18 --> 02:24:42.02
younger, you know, when they're 15, 16, 17 years old, because they're marking time.

2538
02:24:42.02 --> 02:24:44.22
You know, they're having fun, yeah.

2539
02:24:44.22 --> 02:24:46.34
But it's cool to have fun.

2540
02:24:46.34 --> 02:24:50.74
Let's make sure we're making some progress and building some capacity to have a better

2541
02:24:50.74 --> 02:24:51.74
future.

2542
02:24:51.74 --> 02:24:55.74
All the time, what can you do to build capacity for your future?

2543
02:24:55.74 --> 02:24:59.06
Hey, you know, you're Andy Stumpen, I talk about this.

2544
02:24:59.06 --> 02:25:04.54
We didn't even recognize that there's anything else you could do besides being the teams.

2545
02:25:04.54 --> 02:25:06.18
That's it.

2546
02:25:06.18 --> 02:25:07.18
That's it.

2547
02:25:07.18 --> 02:25:10.94
And that's kind of good because when you're young, teams don't want to be thinking about

2548
02:25:10.94 --> 02:25:11.94
anything else.

2549
02:25:11.94 --> 02:25:16.46
And luckily, the team's does give you preparation for other things in life, because you're

2550
02:25:16.46 --> 02:25:19.22
in leadership position, you're going up, you're learning skills, you're learning, whether

2551
02:25:19.22 --> 02:25:23.06
you're learning, parachuting, you're learning stuff, guys get out of the teams all the

2552
02:25:23.06 --> 02:25:27.58
time they become cops, they become firemen, they all kinds of good jobs.

2553
02:25:27.58 --> 02:25:31.50
If you're not in a job like that, you're in a job like a being a nightclub bouncer.

2554
02:25:31.50 --> 02:25:34.10
Hey, it's a fun job, right?

2555
02:25:34.10 --> 02:25:35.10
It's cool.

2556
02:25:35.10 --> 02:25:36.62
You're having a good time.

2557
02:25:36.62 --> 02:25:39.50
But let's make sure we have an extra strategy on that one.

2558
02:25:39.50 --> 02:25:40.50
Right.

2559
02:25:40.50 --> 02:25:41.50
Yeah.

2560
02:25:41.50 --> 02:25:44.86
And it doesn't even necessarily mean like if I wanted to be ultimately, and I'm just saying

2561
02:25:44.86 --> 02:25:49.62
being conscious of it, where if I wanted to be a nightclub owner or something perfect,

2562
02:25:49.62 --> 02:25:51.02
I'll stay right in there.

2563
02:25:51.02 --> 02:25:56.90
And but here's the difference is I'm not, I wasn't consciously spending that time preparing

2564
02:25:56.90 --> 02:25:57.90
for anything.

2565
02:25:57.90 --> 02:26:00.46
I was going for tomorrow, I was going for, you know, this weekend.

2566
02:26:00.46 --> 02:26:02.26
That's all I was going for.

2567
02:26:02.26 --> 02:26:07.70
And a lot of times, I mean in the nightclub it was because it was like a very recognizable

2568
02:26:07.70 --> 02:26:11.14
payoff because it's fun and there's this party going on.

2569
02:26:11.14 --> 02:26:15.70
But even in these grinds, like let's say I was working for a moving company one time.

2570
02:26:15.70 --> 02:26:16.70
It was the same thing.

2571
02:26:16.70 --> 02:26:17.86
I was looking for the weekend.

2572
02:26:17.86 --> 02:26:22.46
It's sucked, but I was like the work part sucked, but I was looking forward to getting

2573
02:26:22.46 --> 02:26:23.46
off work.

2574
02:26:23.46 --> 02:26:24.46
Okay.

2575
02:26:24.46 --> 02:26:28.06
The same dynamic, just kind of negative, you know, it's like negative person.

2576
02:26:28.06 --> 02:26:29.62
The positive is the relief kind of thing.

2577
02:26:29.62 --> 02:26:34.90
Well, that one, the moving company made you want to eat forced your hand to want to

2578
02:26:34.90 --> 02:26:35.90
go do something else.

2579
02:26:35.90 --> 02:26:36.90
It's like a different lifestyle.

2580
02:26:36.90 --> 02:26:37.90
What is the nightclub?

2581
02:26:37.90 --> 02:26:38.90
Yeah.

2582
02:26:38.90 --> 02:26:41.50
You can get distracted and into that way.

2583
02:26:41.50 --> 02:26:43.10
Like, hey, this is just going to be cool.

2584
02:26:43.10 --> 02:26:44.10
Right.

2585
02:26:44.10 --> 02:26:45.10
Yeah.

2586
02:26:45.10 --> 02:26:48.74
So it's that carrot and the stick, you know, the nightclub was, I was just eating that carrot.

2587
02:26:48.74 --> 02:26:51.54
That was running front of my face every day or every week or whatever.

2588
02:26:51.54 --> 02:26:55.70
The moving company was like, I'm just trying to run away from the stick that's hitting

2589
02:26:55.70 --> 02:26:57.14
me every day, kind of thing.

2590
02:26:57.14 --> 02:27:00.46
So I guess it just depends on how much you hate sticks and like carrots.

2591
02:27:00.46 --> 02:27:01.46
It's just so good.

2592
02:27:01.46 --> 02:27:04.70
And like you said, we don't listen to our parents or we don't listen to our people around

2593
02:27:04.70 --> 02:27:05.70
us.

2594
02:27:05.70 --> 02:27:06.70
We don't listen to it.

2595
02:27:06.70 --> 02:27:09.42
It becomes noise that's why even you saying, what do you, what do you want to do with

2596
02:27:09.42 --> 02:27:10.42
your future bro?

2597
02:27:10.42 --> 02:27:13.18
I've heard that since literally since I could understand English, what are you going to do

2598
02:27:13.18 --> 02:27:15.22
with your, what are you doing in prepare for your future?

2599
02:27:15.22 --> 02:27:16.22
What are you going to do?

2600
02:27:16.22 --> 02:27:18.02
Do you see yourself doing this for, oh, yeah, no.

2601
02:27:18.02 --> 02:27:19.02
I don't know.

2602
02:27:19.02 --> 02:27:21.62
It's just, it's a meme or anything.

2603
02:27:21.62 --> 02:27:23.66
Here at all the time, so it doesn't mean anything.

2604
02:27:23.66 --> 02:27:27.86
That's why a lot of times it takes like something to either refraze it or straight up

2605
02:27:27.86 --> 02:27:29.50
like show it to you somehow.

2606
02:27:29.50 --> 02:27:30.50
You know where it hits you.

2607
02:27:30.50 --> 02:27:34.30
Or like Dave was talking his, his, he was cruising and his dad died.

2608
02:27:34.30 --> 02:27:37.86
And he got shown and we're like, okay, what am I doing?

2609
02:27:37.86 --> 02:27:39.66
So good stuff to think about.

2610
02:27:39.66 --> 02:27:42.26
Yeah, I mean personally, I just got tired of them.

2611
02:27:42.26 --> 02:27:43.26
So yeah.

2612
02:27:43.26 --> 02:27:47.54
Well, glad you did.

2613
02:27:47.54 --> 02:27:52.98
So yeah.

2614
02:27:52.98 --> 02:27:53.98
The next question.

2615
02:27:53.98 --> 02:27:59.30
I think we had time for one more question.

2616
02:27:59.30 --> 02:28:00.30
Yeah.

2617
02:28:00.30 --> 02:28:01.30
Jocco.

2618
02:28:01.30 --> 02:28:02.58
I have read your book, Extreme Ownership.

2619
02:28:02.58 --> 02:28:06.94
My son and I listened to your podcast on the way home from hockey practice.

2620
02:28:06.94 --> 02:28:11.46
And while I can see your message, I can't bring myself to employ it, which I would like

2621
02:28:11.46 --> 02:28:15.10
to do so very badly, any suggestions.

2622
02:28:15.10 --> 02:28:23.74
Well, everybody wants to employ extreme ownership and discipline so very badly.

2623
02:28:25.58 --> 02:28:28.94
But everybody also wants it to be easy.

2624
02:28:30.54 --> 02:28:35.26
Right, they want some secret power that just makes it happen.

2625
02:28:35.26 --> 02:28:46.30
And they think that I hold the magic key that's going to make discipline the easiest thing in a world.

2626
02:28:46.30 --> 02:28:51.34
Well, I can tell you that taking ownership of your life isn't easy.

2627
02:28:53.18 --> 02:28:59.74
And living the life of discipline isn't easy.

2628
02:28:59.74 --> 02:29:05.82
In fact, it's hard. That's why it works.

2629
02:29:06.78 --> 02:29:13.18
And so if you want to employ discipline, there's only one way to do it.

2630
02:29:13.18 --> 02:29:20.06
You employ discipline. Stop looking around for suggestions on how to employ discipline.

2631
02:29:21.66 --> 02:29:28.30
Because I'll tell you that listening to this podcast is not going to give you discipline.

2632
02:29:28.30 --> 02:29:31.34
Reading the book is not going to give you discipline.

2633
02:29:31.34 --> 02:29:34.94
You have to impose discipline on yourself. You!

2634
02:29:37.34 --> 02:29:45.26
And you do that with steps that you execute.

2635
02:29:45.26 --> 02:29:47.10
Small steps get up early.

2636
02:29:48.70 --> 02:29:52.94
Work out hard. Attack your daily tasks. Crush your job.

2637
02:29:52.94 --> 02:29:59.42
Don't waste time on on meaningless activities.

2638
02:30:03.02 --> 02:30:06.62
That's how you employ discipline.

2639
02:30:07.90 --> 02:30:11.50
You get aggressive in making things happen.

2640
02:30:12.46 --> 02:30:15.18
Be the discipline. That's it.

2641
02:30:17.42 --> 02:30:20.30
That's it. It's that simple. And I'll say it again.

2642
02:30:20.30 --> 02:30:28.38
If you want to live a discipline life, that's what you have to do.

2643
02:30:30.30 --> 02:30:35.50
You have to be the discipline.

2644
02:30:40.14 --> 02:30:45.02
And I think that's, I don't know what's got for tonight.

2645
02:30:45.02 --> 02:30:52.94
So echo. Yes, I know you've been kind of stepping up the discipline and ownership.

2646
02:30:54.54 --> 02:30:58.94
Won't you take some ownership right now of telling people how they can support

2647
02:31:00.30 --> 02:31:03.82
this podcast if they want to. I will.

2648
02:31:05.98 --> 02:31:11.82
Before supporting this podcast, I think we all should support ourselves in this way.

2649
02:31:11.82 --> 02:31:15.74
Similar to like on the airplane. Like I said before, you know the airplane,

2650
02:31:15.74 --> 02:31:18.94
oxygen mask. You got to put on yourself before you can help the infant.

2651
02:31:19.98 --> 02:31:22.70
Not that the not that this podcast is an infant or nothing.

2652
02:31:22.70 --> 02:31:25.26
Maybe it is one year or whatever. Anyway, you know what I mean.

2653
02:31:26.22 --> 02:31:31.02
So if you're, I've been into working out more, more consistently.

2654
02:31:31.02 --> 02:31:34.94
Would you say it like? Because I was, you know, I'm no stranger to the workouts.

2655
02:31:34.94 --> 02:31:45.98
Um, I've been supplementing my workouts with supplements as you know.

2656
02:31:47.82 --> 02:31:51.98
Crill oil just got some more boom. You know that when you get new crill oil,

2657
02:31:52.62 --> 02:31:56.78
like I get it now before I run out, you know? I mean it seems obvious like oh,

2658
02:31:56.78 --> 02:32:02.14
stock, yeah, you're in a dope now and you're prepared. I could. Yes exactly.

2659
02:32:02.14 --> 02:32:05.74
Which is new for me. The buzz is still going. I'm out of crill oil.

2660
02:32:05.74 --> 02:32:09.42
How order so now? The beginning of week. Yeah, no. Yeah, not an other.

2661
02:32:09.42 --> 02:32:13.18
That's not going on anymore. Which is another demonstration of discipline. Really?

2662
02:32:13.18 --> 02:32:17.34
You know, okay. We count that. Yeah, that's kind of counts. They daily discipline.

2663
02:32:17.34 --> 02:32:20.54
Yeah, I know. They're in crill oil. Before you're out. That's it.

2664
02:32:20.54 --> 02:32:23.10
That's it. Right. It's true. I like what you've done there.

2665
02:32:23.10 --> 02:32:26.54
When it comes in, I'm not even out of my old, but when it comes in, it feels good.

2666
02:32:26.54 --> 02:32:29.26
Oh, the crill oils in. It feels good to be prepared.

2667
02:32:29.26 --> 02:32:33.98
Yeah. So yeah, you feel prepared. You are prepared. Yeah, you are.

2668
02:32:33.98 --> 02:32:37.74
Feel it because you are straight up. Anyway, crill oil. If you don't know,

2669
02:32:39.82 --> 02:32:42.30
what's crill oil? Oh, make a threes is it? Yeah.

2670
02:32:43.90 --> 02:32:48.70
Anyway, it's real good for your joints. But really, that's the, I mean, omega threes. Good. Cool.

2671
02:32:49.50 --> 02:32:53.82
But the question is, if you don't know, it's kind of like, what does that do for me?

2672
02:32:53.82 --> 02:32:57.66
You know, what? How is that going to look? How's the omega threes going to benefit me?

2673
02:32:57.66 --> 02:33:02.94
And in the crill oil situation, it's your joints, especially if you do a lot of pressing

2674
02:33:03.98 --> 02:33:09.98
exercises and you get to. Actions say, especially I'm just saying, including, but not limited to hard

2675
02:33:09.98 --> 02:33:15.10
pressing and you just exercise is like, were you done there? I'm telling you, man, it's a truth.

2676
02:33:15.10 --> 02:33:17.82
Um, anyway, yeah, so get on that crill oil. If you have joint,

2677
02:33:19.10 --> 02:33:25.50
a joint situation, really. Yeah. Or if you don't, or if you don't prevent it. Yeah. Yeah.

2678
02:33:25.50 --> 02:33:30.38
I need to do more preventative stuff in my life. Yeah. It's funny. I'll take them.

2679
02:33:31.34 --> 02:33:36.22
Like, I'll pour them out, you know. And they look like jelly beans. Yeah. I didn't realize they look like

2680
02:33:36.22 --> 02:33:42.06
jumping my daughter. She's four. So I go jelly beans. But you smell them. No, she don't bite them. She, you

2681
02:33:42.06 --> 02:33:46.46
know, you smell them. Yeah. It's smell like crill oil. Hey, I was on the plummet. So they made

2682
02:33:46.46 --> 02:33:51.66
disgusting jelly beans. If you were seeing those before, they, they make jelly beans that taste like

2683
02:33:51.66 --> 02:33:57.10
puked the taste like what like on purpose. Yeah. It's like a joke. So I was on the

2684
02:33:57.10 --> 02:34:06.14
plummet in Iraq and somebody sent me a care package, a care package. Right. They were being funny.

2685
02:34:06.14 --> 02:34:11.34
They sent me some of them bad tasting jelly beans. I didn't look at the label. I just opened them up

2686
02:34:11.34 --> 02:34:16.38
because I had that any candy in a while. I wanted some candy. Yeah, I'm home. Took a mouthful.

2687
02:34:16.38 --> 02:34:22.78
Just puked them all up in there. Dang. Is disgusting. Yeah. So the cruel oil jelly beans

2688
02:34:22.78 --> 02:34:26.70
more or less the same thing. Yeah, you don't want to bite them at eat them. Yeah, the packaging is

2689
02:34:26.70 --> 02:34:35.18
different. So they don't, you know, where can you get those things? Anyways. If you're interested in these

2690
02:34:36.78 --> 02:34:42.22
cruel oil tablets, this is what they are. No, cruel oil, a little tablet to eat them. Did you

2691
02:34:42.22 --> 02:34:48.86
em if you want, swallow it, my recommend because they smell and taste like cruel oil. Anyway,

2692
02:34:48.86 --> 02:34:53.26
but they're good for your joints. Yeah, on it. Okay. So the really all the supplements you're going to

2693
02:34:53.26 --> 02:35:01.18
want to take is from on it. So go to onit.com slash jockel if you want the 10% off. But

2694
02:35:02.30 --> 02:35:08.78
like I said, back to the support part where okay. So you know how like when you work out and then

2695
02:35:08.78 --> 02:35:14.70
you ever work on your like, a my knees or my elbow or something is bothering you? Yeah. It's like your

2696
02:35:14.70 --> 02:35:21.74
whole body is working fine. You can bench a bunch. You can squat a bunch, but it's like your elbow. It's like,

2697
02:35:21.74 --> 02:35:31.66
you know, you're only as strong as your weakest. L. Both knees, that's your weak length right there.

2698
02:35:31.66 --> 02:35:36.70
That's what the cruel oil does. That's what it alleviates. You know? That's important is what I'm

2699
02:35:36.70 --> 02:35:43.10
seeing. Yeah. Yeah. He's the thing. I didn't really understand that. But I've done it where I've taken

2700
02:35:43.10 --> 02:35:48.54
like ibuprofen to like okay. It's because it's just pain. Right. It's not like I'm going to

2701
02:35:48.54 --> 02:35:53.58
pull like if it's your muscle or something like a straightened injury. Yeah, it's like a pain,

2702
02:35:53.58 --> 02:35:56.78
but it'll inhibit because you have a little bit of it. It's just side to start taking cruel oil.

2703
02:35:58.14 --> 02:36:01.82
I mean, I know I'd take and I was like, yeah, you should try it or did I say that or did you start

2704
02:36:01.82 --> 02:36:07.58
trying on your own? It was you. But I heard about it. You know, my wife's my father-in-law would

2705
02:36:07.58 --> 02:36:11.58
I was cruel oil. It was a bit of a fish oil. I was like cool. I don't even take fish oil. So they didn't

2706
02:36:11.58 --> 02:36:17.18
really mean much to me. I left nothing. I'm looking for games bro. Yeah. I'm not coming back here.

2707
02:36:17.18 --> 02:36:22.38
Chances to you. Yeah, bro. I leave me alone. But yeah, that was it. And you mentioned it. And

2708
02:36:23.90 --> 02:36:30.14
you know, you're not hobbling around in pain or on the susahe of Jocco doesn't let me go try

2709
02:36:30.14 --> 02:36:35.66
and then I got it from a guy that was like a power lifter really strong and he was, you know,

2710
02:36:35.66 --> 02:36:40.22
56 years old when I met him. He was a great shape and I asked like what do you do? He said,

2711
02:36:40.22 --> 02:36:45.58
grow oil. Yeah. I told that's not the only thing. He also works out hard and all that stuff.

2712
02:36:45.58 --> 02:36:49.42
But yeah, it's a good thing to know about. That's really, that was kind of my point really.

2713
02:36:49.42 --> 02:36:53.42
You know, like my, you know, you can be strong, but when you got your elbow jacked up from

2714
02:36:54.38 --> 02:36:59.42
being strong, really. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know, you got to patch that little thing naturally.

2715
02:36:59.42 --> 02:37:04.62
Like, because it's not like you're putting quarters, quarters on shots or in my case, I'd be

2716
02:37:04.62 --> 02:37:10.22
proficient just to mask the pain so you can get gains. It's different. It's like a whole thing.

2717
02:37:10.22 --> 02:37:15.10
I was telling Taylor. I was talking with him. We rolled for a little, did we? No, we didn't.

2718
02:37:15.10 --> 02:37:20.06
We were just talking and I told him how old that was and he was like, what, you know,

2719
02:37:20.78 --> 02:37:26.70
it's the krill oil man. Notice I didn't mention how old I am. Yeah.

2720
02:37:26.70 --> 02:37:33.18
Nonetheless, if you like krill, I actually there's some good to, oh, you know, the part. Okay. So there's this total strength and performance.

2721
02:37:33.18 --> 02:37:39.82
Hmm. To, I was looking at that because it's really interesting, like stuff in the clinical studies. It's over time.

2722
02:37:40.22 --> 02:37:44.62
So it is considered a pre workout. So typically when people,

2723
02:37:45.26 --> 02:37:51.18
we should take it consistently consistently. Yeah. You, your gains, it's like a cumulative effect.

2724
02:37:51.18 --> 02:37:56.86
You know what I mean? Just like krill oil though, really. Like, because here's why I got tricked. I didn't get tricked.

2725
02:37:56.86 --> 02:37:58.70
But here's why I misunderstood.

2726
02:38:00.06 --> 02:38:04.22
Is usually a pre workout has like caffeine and stimulants in a particular, you know?

2727
02:38:04.22 --> 02:38:09.34
And should all have like other stuff allegedly? I don't know. But usually you take a pre workout.

2728
02:38:09.34 --> 02:38:15.10
So you get fired up physiologically to go lift, get a big pump, get all this, you know,

2729
02:38:15.10 --> 02:38:17.66
this performance stuff or whatever from the caffeine and all that.

2730
02:38:17.66 --> 02:38:24.70
Total strength and performance doesn't have caffeine. Yeah. So it's a different, it's a whole different

2731
02:38:24.70 --> 02:38:29.34
kind of system that's giving you, you know, benefits. It feels good though. Yeah. But,

2732
02:38:29.34 --> 02:38:33.82
true tech too, same thing where you can take it that day and you'll feel it that day. Because it,

2733
02:38:33.82 --> 02:38:37.50
you know, helps you. That's why oxygen. Like I said, I double, I double dip on those things.

2734
02:38:37.50 --> 02:38:42.22
I get all of it all up on it and down. Actually, my trip to South Africa didn't have either.

2735
02:38:42.22 --> 02:38:47.58
Okay. Yeah. Yeah. What do you call it when you don't take the supplement?

2736
02:38:47.58 --> 02:38:53.58
Going slick, I guess. Yeah. We got some good rolls out there too. Yeah. I was, I was

2737
02:38:54.38 --> 02:38:57.74
thanking myself. Like the guys that were down there.

2738
02:38:58.78 --> 02:39:03.02
Chef and Richie, they're like, hey, you know tomorrow night because I went rolled the first night

2739
02:39:03.58 --> 02:39:08.86
at their fight fit and the the first night, you know, we trained a little bit, you know,

2740
02:39:08.86 --> 02:39:12.46
what we were hanging out and then they said, hey, when you come back tomorrow, we're just going to do like

2741
02:39:12.46 --> 02:39:17.98
10 rounds, 10, five minute rounds. I was like, okay, cool. And then I got the home. The next morning

2742
02:39:17.98 --> 02:39:21.74
or the next afternoon we were heading over to I said, yeah, I wouldn't mind having a little bit of

2743
02:39:21.74 --> 02:39:28.70
shrimp tack right now. And I had to go slick. Good times. Hey, man. You know, and hey, going slick,

2744
02:39:28.70 --> 02:39:34.62
that's cool. But you don't have to. Yeah. No. I mean, we didn't want to. I wanted to have a little

2745
02:39:34.62 --> 02:39:39.50
bit of a shrimp tack right there. Yes. So some of us, we don't want that be. You know, so we're

2746
02:39:39.50 --> 02:39:44.22
going to take this shrimp tack. We're going to take the the crew to me again back to not to go to

2747
02:39:44.22 --> 02:39:48.86
deep on the crew oil. But that one, I think is like an essential. Let's like in every day thing,

2748
02:39:48.86 --> 02:39:54.94
you know, like people they'll drink coffee every single day. Yeah, I mean. And cool. I say cool

2749
02:39:54.94 --> 02:39:59.82
drink coffee, but it should be like that because the crew is way more beneficial than the coffee.

2750
02:39:59.82 --> 02:40:05.82
I think coffee is more like it's like a immediate thing. Anyway, anyway, like this stuff,

2751
02:40:07.82 --> 02:40:12.54
these cool supplements, good. The best supplements everyone knows this already go to on a

2752
02:40:12.54 --> 02:40:21.10
duck home slash jockel for 10% off. Also a good way to support the podcast is the Amazon

2753
02:40:21.10 --> 02:40:26.14
click through all all that is is before you do Amazon shopping, click through the website. I got a

2754
02:40:26.14 --> 02:40:34.78
better little Amazon shopping banner. Got the dot com got the dot co dot UK one and I want to say

2755
02:40:34.78 --> 02:40:42.54
the German you want to. Over there on the side of the website, jockelpodcast.com and also up top on the

2756
02:40:42.54 --> 02:40:47.74
navigation menu. Easy to find is what you're saying. Easyer than it was before for sure. Let's go.

2757
02:40:47.74 --> 02:40:52.46
And then on the store, I think it's like in the support tab. Anyway, before you do your Amazon

2758
02:40:52.46 --> 02:40:56.86
shopping, click on that first, then do your shopping. We're gonna go to what you're buying.

2759
02:40:59.18 --> 02:41:03.42
I always make the sodium in the water reference because really that's what it is. Really,

2760
02:41:03.42 --> 02:41:09.50
that's the best reference. I mean the best analogy, you know. It is, bro. Okay, I said okay.

2761
02:41:09.50 --> 02:41:14.22
Yeah, but the way the tone was like this, but here's the thing that's a big deal.

2762
02:41:15.74 --> 02:41:21.02
Small piece of sodium. Drop it in water, see what happens. Do you see what happens? Actually,

2763
02:41:21.02 --> 02:41:25.42
they don't do that. Look at look up a video. See what happens. That's good. And that's what you are

2764
02:41:25.42 --> 02:41:30.54
really. You do this a lot. I think the biggest thing is people don't people think it's not a big deal.

2765
02:41:31.18 --> 02:41:34.54
That's the thing. Yeah, tell the little piece of sodium. Tell that to the sodium.

2766
02:41:34.54 --> 02:41:39.98
Yeah, 20 hits water. Yeah, you go and you do small action takes two set literally two seconds.

2767
02:41:40.86 --> 02:41:44.94
Boom. Click and big reaction. Good support. Good reinforcements.

2768
02:41:46.14 --> 02:41:50.46
What if you kind of needed some reinforcements and it took just one click of a thing.

2769
02:41:50.46 --> 02:41:54.54
And it brought just a full-on reinforcement into your situation. That's good, right?

2770
02:41:54.54 --> 02:41:58.46
Yeah, that's why action be. Sounds good to me. Anyway, that's what the Amazon click through does.

2771
02:41:58.46 --> 02:42:02.54
And that's how you do it. Go to jokpacass.com. Click on the Amazon.

2772
02:42:02.54 --> 02:42:06.62

2775
02:42:24.94 --> 02:42:32.70
If you're in the mood. If you were moved by jokkoswords or echoeswords or echoeswords.

2776
02:42:33.50 --> 02:42:35.82
Leave a review. You'll see what up.

2777
02:42:35.82 --> 02:42:43.42
Um, also subscribe to our YouTube channel. We have a YouTube channel.

2778
02:42:43.42 --> 02:42:48.30
I know a lot of people already know that. And a lot of people have YouTube channels.

2779
02:42:48.30 --> 02:42:51.74
Yeah. How do you distinguish which one's good and which one's not good?

2780
02:42:51.74 --> 02:42:55.42
Right. Well, here's a good thing about subscribing to YouTube channels.

2781
02:42:55.42 --> 02:43:00.06
Is you just click subscribe. And if you, I guess it, you know, it shows the new videos in your

2782
02:43:00.06 --> 02:43:06.70
feed. You can elect to have a notification or not. It's good to have a notification. And it doesn't

2783
02:43:06.70 --> 02:43:10.78
annoy you because for something to annoy you, it would have to happen a lot. But since you don't

2784
02:43:10.78 --> 02:43:16.54
make a lot of videos. I do know. Actually, you plan on what you mean by a lot. So at least two

2785
02:43:16.54 --> 02:43:22.30
week will be uploaded. Oh, one will be the podcast. One will be something else. Okay. I think that is a

2786
02:43:22.30 --> 02:43:27.58
that you just threw down the gauntlet. Now, I'm going to track your videos. I know, real. Do it.

2787
02:43:27.58 --> 02:43:33.50
Hey, if echo doesn't put up at least two videos a week from here on out, we can attack him on the

2788
02:43:33.50 --> 02:43:40.94
interwebs verbally. Please. Yeah, man. No, hey, I'm accountable. You know. Okay. Yeah, you just made yourself

2789
02:43:40.94 --> 02:43:48.14
accountable. Sounds good. There it is. But yes, it's a little bit of an extreme order. Anyway,

2790
02:43:48.14 --> 02:43:52.06
good thing about subscribing to YouTube. You can just subscribe like anything else. It's not like

2791
02:43:52.06 --> 02:43:57.74
these, you know, these marketers who email you stuff. Yeah. It's like, hey, unsubscribe. Do like

2792
02:43:57.74 --> 02:44:03.50
you. I want one can I chicken with for you four years ago. You're still emailing me. I didn't

2793
02:44:03.50 --> 02:44:09.10
need some. That's good. Yeah. Stop. Why do I have the option to unsubscribe to your email list

2794
02:44:09.10 --> 02:44:13.74
when I didn't even subscribe to it? Get away from this. Yeah. So it's not like that kind of where you

2795
02:44:13.74 --> 02:44:19.18
click unsubscribe. And then they email you again, by the way. This is just a confirm. We're sorry to see

2796
02:44:19.18 --> 02:44:24.06
you go. Why this? Why? And then you got to fill out. It's not like that. And then six and you're,

2797
02:44:24.06 --> 02:44:28.62
you will stop receiving email in six to eight weeks. Yeah, or something. Something. Yeah. It's not like that.

2798
02:44:28.62 --> 02:44:33.02
Unsubscribe done. Problem solved. And then you'd re-subscribe. You know, it's totally up to you.

2799
02:44:33.02 --> 02:44:40.46
Empower yourself on the subscribing situation. That's YouTube. So yeah, some videos on there will

2800
02:44:40.46 --> 02:44:47.98
we'll try to keep you somewhat occupied on there. It's good. Anyway, and also Jocco as a store.

2801
02:44:47.98 --> 02:44:54.06
It's called JoccoStore. JoccoStore.com. If you wear shirts and you want to represent that way,

2802
02:44:54.06 --> 02:44:59.66
I think we're going to put some new shirts on there. Some new stuff. You know what I did? What we did,

2803
02:44:59.66 --> 02:45:07.82
really, is people listen to you, Jocco. I listen to you, but the good thing about you is actually

2804
02:45:07.82 --> 02:45:12.94
actually one of the reasons I listened to is because you listen to me and you listen to others.

2805
02:45:12.94 --> 02:45:20.22
You know, we listen to others. So people will like, hey, XYZ, make that into a shirt or you know,

2806
02:45:20.22 --> 02:45:23.50
hey, you said to make that into a shirt or they'll just come up with their own thing,

2807
02:45:23.50 --> 02:45:28.22
you know, prioritize X-X out and whatever make it a shirt. So during that listening,

2808
02:45:30.22 --> 02:45:36.22
like, kind of, we kind of just took it to heart in a real general way and there's some new stuff.

2809
02:45:36.22 --> 02:45:41.82
I like that. It's good. It's good options. But you can't, we can't make every shirt that

2810
02:45:41.82 --> 02:45:47.50
everything. No, and I just don't that wouldn't be practical. No, wouldn't be. And some,

2811
02:45:47.50 --> 02:45:51.50
I mean, I got to be honest. Plus I say, I say some cool stuff. I also say some dumb stuff.

2812
02:45:51.50 --> 02:45:56.54
Some of my picks and dumb stuff. Yeah, or, you know, something that maybe wouldn't translate

2813
02:45:56.54 --> 02:46:02.14
onto a shirt that someone would actually wear other than maybe a handful of people. Then we'll just say

2814
02:46:02.14 --> 02:46:09.58
some sure that it is make more sense than others. We'll just say that. But nonetheless, we are listening,

2815
02:46:09.58 --> 02:46:16.06
and this is going to be a result of it with some, you know, maybe some new stuff. There's also some patches.

2816
02:46:16.78 --> 02:46:22.38
Cool patches. The Velcro ones and whatnot. Hoodies, rash guards, performance.

2817
02:46:23.10 --> 02:46:26.78
I think we're doing another rash guard design as well. Not going to get rid of the old ones.

2818
02:46:26.78 --> 02:46:32.54
The current one is not on scope too. Nonetheless, just more options, you know, guys want to get

2819
02:46:32.54 --> 02:46:36.70
after it and have different looks. Maybe even have two in rotation that look different, boom.

2820
02:46:36.70 --> 02:46:41.90
So yeah, we did that anyway. All these things you can look at them. If you like what you see,

2821
02:46:41.90 --> 02:46:47.90
want to, three things, whatever, however many things get it, support that way. Good way to support.

2822
02:46:47.90 --> 02:46:54.22
It's not your good way, yeah. And you're representing. So it's kind of like, it's like an

2823
02:46:54.22 --> 02:47:02.54
official way to kind of jump in the game, you know, you know what I mean? I do. I saw a member,

2824
02:47:02.54 --> 02:47:07.90
um, I don't know if, yeah, you met him right? Yeah, Sam, he came in the gym and shaved head.

2825
02:47:07.90 --> 02:47:11.26
Yeah, Sam. So he was just sitting there in the, done in the lounge. I'm just saying,

2826
02:47:11.26 --> 02:47:17.10
I'm going to get something to my car real quick. I see the shirt. Of course, I'm going to say

2827
02:47:17.10 --> 02:47:21.26
something, but before I say anything, I'm thinking about my look at this guy representing hard.

2828
02:47:21.26 --> 02:47:25.34
And the thing is, I don't know, you know, you know, the guy having met or whatever, and you

2829
02:47:25.34 --> 02:47:29.34
get that feeling like that guy's representing. And that's the feeling you get really, you know, when

2830
02:47:29.34 --> 02:47:34.14
you see somebody in the wild with it? Well, I actually figured out I got a little story to tell

2831
02:47:34.14 --> 02:47:42.30
somebody hit me up and they said, hey, I was out in the wild saw someone with a, with a, with a

2832
02:47:42.30 --> 02:47:49.34
jockel podcast, t-shirt on walked over to him through the bone of feedies on him. He's a bone of feedies.

2833
02:47:49.34 --> 02:47:55.74
One of these is like, you ever seen like a spy movie where I come up and I say, it is cold and dark

2834
02:47:55.74 --> 02:48:01.98
in the winter and the first in response in March, it will be warmer. And now we know we're going to go.

2835
02:48:01.98 --> 02:48:06.38
So what was the bone of feedies? This dude walked up to the other dude with a trooper t-shirt on.

2836
02:48:06.38 --> 02:48:13.82
And he said, good evening, Echo. And boom, they knew what was up. So I think that's become the

2837
02:48:13.82 --> 02:48:18.62
official bone of feedies of jockel podcast. If you, if you see someone in the wild,

2838
02:48:18.62 --> 02:48:23.02
and you, you know, my piece of situation where you can't just get crazy, you just got to walk

2839
02:48:23.02 --> 02:48:26.62
up and say, good evening, Echo. And then they'll, then you can do your burpees.

2840
02:48:26.62 --> 02:48:27.82
Yeah.

2841
02:48:27.82 --> 02:48:28.78
Yeah.

2842
02:48:28.78 --> 02:48:34.22
Exactly. And that feeling is real though. That feeling that I had when you, when you see

2843
02:48:34.22 --> 02:48:37.90
it's like, oh, yeah, you kind of know, you know, anyway, it's cool out. We'll add it later.

2844
02:48:39.26 --> 02:48:45.66
If you will. Anyway, also psychological warfare. If you don't know what psychological warfare,

2845
02:48:45.66 --> 02:48:51.50
this is what it is. It's an album with tracks. And this is, they're not music tracks.

2846
02:48:51.50 --> 02:48:57.26
They're not jockel's hardcore band tracks. Bronson's Children's Tracks. It's not that.

2847
02:48:58.86 --> 02:49:04.14
What it is is little, they're not even excerpts because they're just low and tracks for specific

2848
02:49:04.14 --> 02:49:09.26
things. And those things are, if you're feeling weakness at any point, while you're trying to consistently

2849
02:49:09.26 --> 02:49:16.54
get after it wake up early or work out or it's a little thick tier mental QRF quick reaction force.

2850
02:49:16.54 --> 02:49:19.50
Yeah. That's a weakness sitting you cool. Here we go. Boom.

2851
02:49:19.50 --> 02:49:22.70
Go on QRF. There they are. I kind of look at it as like a spot.

2852
02:49:23.50 --> 02:49:27.74
Yeah. Like when you're those those people that don't lift a spot is when someone helps you.

2853
02:49:27.74 --> 02:49:32.38
Yeah. Lift whatever your weight you're trying to lift. And not to split here, but really it's not

2854
02:49:32.38 --> 02:49:36.54
necessarily there to help you. It's, I mean, ultimately, yeah. General Metcher, you don't go down.

2855
02:49:36.54 --> 02:49:40.86
Yes, exactly. So if you're slipping, if you want to really get after it, I'm going to work

2856
02:49:40.86 --> 02:49:47.98
up every single day, no days off one year. Big, big tall order right there. Just like if I'm, I'm going

2857
02:49:47.98 --> 02:49:57.02
to bench this 10,000 pounds, whatever. I'm going to make two videos a week. I'm going to bench

2858
02:49:57.02 --> 02:50:03.18
more than I've been to before, but I'm going to go for my one rep max. It makes sense to have

2859
02:50:03.18 --> 02:50:08.86
a spot. You might get that one rep max and not need the spot, but it's there. If you fail,

2860
02:50:08.86 --> 02:50:12.86
like if it's like too much or it feels like too much or that guy's there to just nudge you,

2861
02:50:12.86 --> 02:50:16.06
as much as you need. That's really hot. This is just how I look at it.

2862
02:50:16.06 --> 02:50:21.34
That's accurate. Yeah, potentially right. Yeah. So the base what it is is you put the track on,

2863
02:50:21.74 --> 02:50:26.38
like, oh, shoot. I'm about to skip this workout. I'm about to make this workout day a rest day.

2864
02:50:26.38 --> 02:50:30.38
No, you're not. Yeah, you don't want to do that. No, you can rest tomorrow. Today work.

2865
02:50:30.38 --> 02:50:34.30
Rest on the day that you have scheduled for rest for real and your thing. That don't just

2866
02:50:34.30 --> 02:50:39.90
impromptu making a rest day because you feel like it's not how it works. If you need a little spot

2867
02:50:39.90 --> 02:50:45.82
in doing that, you listen to a track called workout, get what, what workout? I don't know. One of

2868
02:50:45.82 --> 02:50:50.70
the workouts spots because there's a couple for workout. There's one for waking up. There's three

2869
02:50:50.70 --> 02:50:55.66
for waking up. Yeah, see? And there's one for kind of sticking to the diet plan. You know,

2870
02:50:55.66 --> 02:51:00.54
like there's that kind of stuff. You know, yeah, you put it on in. There's one for getting

2871
02:51:00.54 --> 02:51:07.26
for forcing yourself through creative blocks. Yeah. Right. Which kind of sounds like impossible,

2872
02:51:07.26 --> 02:51:14.62
but you tell you, who gets possible? I would say I will say that this will get you through

2873
02:51:14.62 --> 02:51:22.06
100% of the time. Like I, I'm trying to imagine the feeling that you would that would result in your

2874
02:51:22.06 --> 02:51:29.66
heart if you listen to this and you still skip the workout. Oh, yeah, it's hard to

2875
02:51:29.66 --> 02:51:34.70
fathom the feeling you would have. Anyway, it's very helpful and a real good spot, you know,

2876
02:51:34.70 --> 02:51:38.86
and a stock will talk me. So it's like kind of there with you, you know? Like that you want there.

2877
02:51:38.86 --> 02:51:43.42
That's my opinion. Anyway, it's called psychological warfare. It's on iTunes. So if you just do a

2878
02:51:43.42 --> 02:51:47.42
search psychological warfare, juggle willing, get that. You can support that way, but

2879
02:51:48.30 --> 02:51:53.02
this is one where this is real good support for yourself. Make it your ringtone, the wake up,

2880
02:51:53.02 --> 02:51:57.42
wake up, yeah, clear it with your wife first. Yeah. You could have some problems. Spouses do not

2881
02:51:57.42 --> 02:52:05.90
like yeah, that's a good one. And it happened happens to be number one still on iTunes. That's awesome.

2882
02:52:05.90 --> 02:52:13.98
Yeah, since day one by the way. Yes, that's thank you for the support and one that one. All right,

2883
02:52:13.98 --> 02:52:19.02
while you're on Amazon, real quick, this is a couple of things I have to cover. I've legally

2884
02:52:19.02 --> 02:52:25.50
have to do this. Juggle white tea where it looks like we have to go put a warning on it because there's

2885
02:52:25.50 --> 02:52:33.02
a little situation going on. Gotta, a, a, a trooper hit me up on Twitter. And this is what he said,

2886
02:52:33.02 --> 02:52:40.38
warning. I started drinking jocoti and the wife became pregnant. Should be on the label. So

2887
02:52:41.34 --> 02:52:47.58
he was also wondering if the child would arrive as a brown belt in jiu-jitsu. Now,

2888
02:52:48.86 --> 02:52:53.42
to be honest with you, we should have tested this further. You know, we should have tested this further.

2889
02:52:53.42 --> 02:53:04.70
We didn't and we aren't 100% sure if babies produced under the influence of jockel white tea will

2890
02:53:04.70 --> 02:53:12.70
be a brown belt. They will be a purple belt, minimum, but they might not be a brown belt. But

2891
02:53:12.70 --> 02:53:21.34
fertility, yep, is confirmed prenatal jiu-jitsu skills, confirmed and confirmed to a level of about

2892
02:53:21.34 --> 02:53:31.34
147% so order the tea, make it drink it. It tastes so good, tastes like victory. So you can get that.

2893
02:53:31.34 --> 02:53:40.14
You can, you can also preorder where the warrior kid book. Now Uncle Jake is trying to explain to Mark

2894
02:53:40.14 --> 02:53:47.66
what a warrior is. So he gives him a notebook that has various warrior codes in it. He's got the

2895
02:53:47.66 --> 02:53:53.18
Ranger Creed. He's got the seal code. He's got the Marine Corps Corps values. He's got the seven

2896
02:53:53.90 --> 02:54:01.42
virtues of buchito. It's the samurai code. He's got the code of shivalry for knights. He's got the

2897
02:54:01.42 --> 02:54:06.30
Viking laws. He's got all these like warrior codes in there so that young Mark knows what is up.

2898
02:54:07.66 --> 02:54:14.78
And we should all, we can all kind of need to know what is up with some of them. The Vikings,

2899
02:54:14.78 --> 02:54:19.34
you know, you might not think you might think yourself out of Viking laws. What kind of liking teach me?

2900
02:54:19.34 --> 02:54:24.06
Why would I need to know Viking laws? How could I possibly get anything? So you get way the warrior

2901
02:54:24.06 --> 02:54:27.58
kid you order it. You will, you start going through the Viking laws. Let me tell you what they say.

2902
02:54:28.46 --> 02:54:37.66
Viking laws. Be brave and aggressive. Be direct. Grab all opportunities. Use varying methods of attack.

2903
02:54:37.66 --> 02:54:45.74
Be versatile and agile. Attack one target at a time. Don't plan everything in detail. Use top

2904
02:54:45.74 --> 02:54:52.86
quality weapons. Be prepared. Keep weapons in good condition. Keep in shape. Find good battle

2905
02:54:52.86 --> 02:55:04.14
comrades. Agree on important points. Choose one chief. Be a good merchant. Find out what the market

2906
02:55:04.14 --> 02:55:14.70
needs. Do not promise what you can't keep. Do not demand overpayment. Arrange things so that you can

2907
02:55:14.70 --> 02:55:25.26
return. Keep the camp in good order. Keep things tidy and organized. Arrange to enjoyable activities

2908
02:55:25.26 --> 02:55:33.18
that strengthen the group. Make sure everybody does useful work. Consult all members of the group

2909
02:55:33.18 --> 02:55:40.46
for advice. Hey, just liking laws 1200 years old. Is there anything you might be able to get

2910
02:55:40.46 --> 02:55:47.98
out of that? Absolutely. We can all take something away from that. So, bunch of warrior codes in there.

2911
02:55:47.98 --> 02:55:55.50
And by the way, Mark, he ends up writing his own warrior kid code. Yeah. The kind of kid code that I

2912
02:55:55.50 --> 02:56:00.30
wish I would have lived by. You know what I'm saying? Yes. It's going to help some people out.

2913
02:56:00.30 --> 02:56:05.66
Also, just release. We got the discipline equals freedom field manual coming. This is what you're

2914
02:56:05.66 --> 02:56:12.62
asking for a book. Pretty much represents what we talk about this on this podcast. Thoughts and action.

2915
02:56:12.62 --> 02:56:18.06
The thoughts are aligned with what you hear on this podcast. The actions are more detailed than

2916
02:56:18.06 --> 02:56:24.30
what I say on the podcast. More granular, more specific workouts of food intake, martial arts. So,

2917
02:56:24.30 --> 02:56:29.58
discipline equals field, discipline equals freedom field manual. You can get some of that.

2918
02:56:31.50 --> 02:56:34.62
You can also pick up a couple copies of extreme ownership. Of course,

2919
02:56:36.14 --> 02:56:40.94
lessons of combat leadership that we talk about on this podcast by the way, from Henry the fifth

2920
02:56:41.90 --> 02:56:49.10
to HR McMaster, spans a pretty good time. And those lessons of combat leadership translate

2921
02:56:49.10 --> 02:56:55.18
to business and life and then laid out in extreme ownership, very simply and very clearly. So,

2922
02:56:55.74 --> 02:56:59.90
what you do is you order one for you and then you order one for everyone in your chain of command,

2923
02:56:59.90 --> 02:57:08.22
up and down. Get some. Mr. May 4th and 5th, New York City, Mary at Marquis,
