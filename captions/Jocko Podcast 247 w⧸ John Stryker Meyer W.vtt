00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
This is Jockel Podcast number 247 with echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink. Good evening, echo. Good evening.

2
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Are you old enough to have a draft card? He says, yes, yes, I'm old enough. I'm 18. We have to have one. Well, do you have one?

3
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Yeah, I say with a full mouth. Sorry about that. Spitting hash browns across the table. Then you're old enough to enlist and get your duty out of the way.

4
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:40.000
You sure you're old enough? You don't look 18. Kind of skinny, too. I don't know if you'd make it through the most basic of training. He rightly smiles.

5
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:56.000
I'm 18. You can prove it. You want to see the card? Testily reaching for my wallet, spitting a mouthful of eggs on the table. Hey, don't go sideways on me, boy. This is a friendly conversation. Not a food fight. The sergeant laughs.

6
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:03.000
The only thing I want you to hand me is your bill for this meal. My treat.

7
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:18.000
You're trying real hard to get me to enlist smiling. I hand him the bill. You are a recruiter. Yes, I'm a recruiter. I'm staff sergeant king. What's your name? Lynn. Lynn Black. Well, Lynn Black.

8
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:25.000
If you volunteer, you get your choice of assignments and which country you want to serve in. How does that sound?

9
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:35.000
And behind door number two, it's got to sound to hell of a lot better than wondering where you're going to spend the night king cracks a smile.

10
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:54.000
My office is right down the street. We eat afterwards. I enlist. And then spend the night at the YMCA paid for by the US Army. The next morning, I'm on a Boeing 707 headed for a medical examination.

11
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
And basic training at Fort Ord, California.

12
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:07.000
During basic, I'm selected for the advanced leadership school at Fort Knox, Kentucky before going on to the armor school.

13
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Fort Knox, that's the place they keep all the gold.

14
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Staff Sergeant King has signed me for three years active duty in the 13th armored career group Europe, Germany, where I'll have access to all the great European art museums and the artwork of the old masters.

15
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000
The Army is going to pay me to tour Europe. What a deal.

16
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:43.000
My driving passion and greatest ambition has always been to spend my life as a fine art painter. I've been working at the local Seattle Television Station,

17
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Art Department all the way through high school. The art director Robert C. Dinsmore is a decorated World War II veteran who has encouraged me to get my military duty out of the way.

18
00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:06.000
The World in 1963 is a peaceful place. Leave it to beaver and I love Lucy, our on television.

19
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:22.000
So you might have caught that name. Lynn Black, and it might sound familiar to you if it does. It's probably because you heard it here from John Stryker, Meyer, A.K.A. Tilt on podcast 180, 1801 or 1802,

20
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:30.000
or maybe you heard it from Doug the Frenchman, L'Eternot on podcast 186.

21
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:38.000
Like John Stryker, Meyer, and like Doug L'Eternot Lynn Black was an Army soldier, a green beret,

22
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:52.000
and he fought Vietnam as a member of SAUG, the studies and observation group, a highly classified group that conducted missions in Vietnam, Cambodia, and L'AVS.

23
00:03:52.000 --> 00:04:06.000
They suffered over 100% casualties, meaning if you are a SAUG operator, you were going to get wounded or killed.

24
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:12.000
That is how these men served and sacrificed.

25
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:28.000
And before you listen to this podcast, if you haven't listened to 1801, 1802, 1806, and additionally 204, 205, and 206 with Dick Thompson, go listen to them.

26
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:39.000
And you'll see that the men of SAUG are true heroes, heroes that conducted completely insane missions,

27
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.000
missions that very few people ever knew about.

28
00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:52.000
And Lynn Black, codenamed Blackjack, wrote a book about his experiences.

29
00:04:52.000 --> 00:05:04.000
And I just read from that book, the book is called Whiskey Tango Fox Trot, WTF, which we are going to dig into today.

30
00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:12.000
Now, unfortunately, for a variety of reasons, Lynn could not make an appearance on the podcast today,

31
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000
but we were able to bring back tilt.

32
00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:32.000
And this is a striker, one of my heroes who served with Lynn on many operations to talk us through the book and provide some details that only someone who was there would know and understand.

33
00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
With that, tilt, thanks for coming back on.

34
00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
Good evening, sir. Good to be back.

35
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
Awesome to have you here.

36
00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
Indeed.

37
00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
You actually sent me this book. Do you remember sending me this book?

38
00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.000
Absolutely.

39
00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
Because it's we did a Frenchman.

40
00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
And I said, Lynn's book was out.

41
00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:57.000
And Lynn Maurice Black Jr's, just a man that always held in the highest esteem ever since the first time we ran in,

42
00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.000
each of that would be one at FUBA 1968, just a character.

43
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.000
Yeah. Well, and it's, I'm hoping that at some point we have the opportunity to get them on here.

44
00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
We'll see how that plays out.

45
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:26.000
But hopefully this will provide some encouragement, you know, just to do this section of the book and man, it's just like every single time I start reviewing what you guys did in Vietnam.

46
00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
I just, I cannot believe what you guys did.

47
00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:37.000
I can't believe the level of heroism and courage that you guys had on all these operations.

48
00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
They're crazy. They're freaking crazy operations.

49
00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:46.000
I told you last time I said, hey, if I wasn't charged, I wouldn't have improved any of those operations.

50
00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.000
Right.

51
00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.000
I remember that.

52
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.000
Yeah, unbelievable.

53
00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:55.000
And, and believe me, I have proved some pretty pretty sketchy operations in my time.

54
00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:01.000
But you guys took it to a whole new level and the success that you guys had on the battlefield was awesome.

55
00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:07.000
And yeah, every time I read through these books, it just blows my mind.

56
00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:14.000
And it's an honor to have you on and to pay some kind of tribute to what you guys did.

57
00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:20.000
And to have, you know, what you guys did was, you know, that's my heritage.

58
00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
Even the arm in the Navy, you're in the army.

59
00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
I mean, just the special operations.

60
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:30.000
What you guys did over there was just laid the groundwork and set the bar so high for the rest of us forever.

61
00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
Oh, well, thank you.

62
00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:38.000
And, you know, and I'm glad you're reading WTF because Lynch is one of those characters.

63
00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.000
I mean, of all the stories for Saag for eight years.

64
00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.000
If you put down some of the most harrowing stories, the top five for eight years,

65
00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
Lynn's got to be right in your top.

66
00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
If not the top one.

67
00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
That's why I'm never going to dig into it a little bit today.

68
00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
Just to pay homage to the man that I've respected from day one.

69
00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
And you guys did, and I don't think we're going to go into this part today.

70
00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:06.000
But you got, but when we covered across the fence and on the ground, you, you and Lynn work together for how long,

71
00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
how long were you guys actually working together?

72
00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:13.000
Oh, he ran if he came on our team for a few matches as a strap hanger.

73
00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.000
Right.

74
00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:19.000
And then we went down to CCN and in January, 69, then he came on a team.

75
00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:26.000
Published for a left, Lynn came on and then our little people loved and put a new from October.

76
00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.000
And so when I left, I just turned a team over to him.

77
00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
I just knew the team was in good hands.

78
00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.000
I never worried about it.

79
00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.000
I came back.

80
00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.000
Lynn was the one zero.

81
00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
I was his one one for a while.

82
00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
And then we took turns and then they finally just said,

83
00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:47.000
Hey, you got too much experience here at Black and a young and put them in some special projects that he went off and did.

84
00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
And I took over right home and back to find a simple recon.

85
00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.000
Where Lynn was doing some classified stuff.

86
00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
All right.

87
00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.000
Well, let's get a little bit.

88
00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.000
Let's learn a little bit about Lynn Black and where he came from.

89
00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
I'm going to go to the book here.

90
00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.000
And it says this in the category of common things that go unnoticed in the world.

91
00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:13.000
While Ho Chi Minh was working for the OSS saving allied lives.

92
00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
Lynn Maurice Black Jr.

93
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:21.000
Was born to Lynn Senior and Violet Black of Albany Oregon.

94
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.000
Lynn Jr.

95
00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.000
That's me.

96
00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
This is where I come into the picture.

97
00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:36.000
I was immediately given the name Bosco when my mother found that by mixing a bit of the chocolate drink into my baby milk, I dosed right off.

98
00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.000
In Burl.

99
00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:38.000
What does Bosco?

100
00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
What is it of some kind of old school chocolate drink?

101
00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.000
Yeah, your son's first.

102
00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.000
Like her she's chocolate.

103
00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.000
Okay.

104
00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.000
I never had Bosco.

105
00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000
I don't know how that missed me because I'm a chocolate milk kind of fiend.

106
00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000
He goes on here in Berlin, Germany on the date and hour of my birth at 10 a.m.

107
00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000
On April 22nd, 8-Alphate,

108
00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:01.000
or declared to his general staff that Germany had lost the war and that he would commit suicide.

109
00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
In 19 and here's the caveat or here's the warning.

110
00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
I'm skipping through this book.

111
00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.000
I'm not going to read the whole thing.

112
00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
So if it seems a little bit chopped up, that's why you got to get the book.

113
00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
He fast forward here.

114
00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
In 1946, my mother was pregnant with my brother Hugh.

115
00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:21.000
We lived in Salem, Oregon, where my father worked for the post-war state employment office.

116
00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
The war machine was winding down and unemployment was high.

117
00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
I was one year old.

118
00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000
April 1947, on my second birthday,

119
00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:34.000
we moved to the corner of 123 bomb and 456 detonator,

120
00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:40.000
ordinance Oregon, which was a Munitions Depot town for World War Two.

121
00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.000
War supplies.

122
00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
My father managed the payroll office for the depot.

123
00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
That's just pretty much the coolest place.

124
00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.000
The coolest address.

125
00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.000
That's great.

126
00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000
That's perfect for Lynn.

127
00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.000
Oh yeah.

128
00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:53.000
Yeah.

129
00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
No doubt about it.

130
00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:56.000
Blowin' things up.

131
00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.000
Oh yeah.

132
00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:03.000
In 1950, I was five when the Korean War broke out.

133
00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:07.000
We had moved down the road to Hermiston, Oregon,

134
00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000
and our father had taken a job with the guy F.

135
00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000
Ackinson construction company as the head of their payroll office.

136
00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.000
Our mother had purchased a small roadhouse diner.

137
00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:25.000
After that, my brothers Hugh, Bruce, and I were on her own.

138
00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
I was the little man, Bosco, the babysitter.

139
00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:33.000
And that same year, the Soviet Union recognized Ho Chi Minh's government.

140
00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:38.000
Even though Vietnam was recognized internationally as part of French in No China,

141
00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:44.000
Joseph Stalin convinced Ho that the Soviet Union would bankroll his fight against the French

142
00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:51.000
if he agreed to allow Chinese advisors to train 60 to 70,000 Vietnam.

143
00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000
Ho bid his lip and agreed to China support,

144
00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:59.000
which enabled him to escalate his fight against France.

145
00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
In 1953, the Korean War ended.

146
00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
I was eight years old.

147
00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:09.000
In the third grade, and in love with the red, headed freckle face girl next door.

148
00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:20.000
On March 13, 1954, with the monetary backing of the Soviets and Chinese advisors,

149
00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:25.000
the Vietnam engaged the French at Denbyn view.

150
00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:32.000
On March 23, the Vietnam captured the main airstrap resulting in partial isolation of French arm units,

151
00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:39.000
and the local man was closed in on the air preventing air drops of supplies, evacuation of the wounded, or close combat air support

152
00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:46.000
as the French ran ever lower on supplies and casualties mounted the Vietnam to control of the countryside.

153
00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:51.000
When the French could no longer patrol, they were forced into purely defensive positions,

154
00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000
which were sheld with big guns several times a day.

155
00:12:54.000 --> 00:13:01.000
On April 7, 1954, Dwight De Eisenhower gave his domino theory speech during a news conference declaring,

156
00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:09.000
finally, you have broader considerations that might follow what you would call the falling domino principle.

157
00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:20.000
You have a row of domino set up, you knock over the first one, and what will happen to the last one is the certainty that it will go over very quickly.

158
00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:27.000
So you could have a beginning of a disintegration that would have the most profound influences.

159
00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:40.000
Nine days later, Vice President Richard Nixon announced that the United States may be putting our own boys in Indo-China regardless of allied support.

160
00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:49.000
It's always important to me to roll through kind of the way these things unfold and pay attention to them.

161
00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:58.000
History. Yeah, and we're living it right now, and I was talking to a friend of mine the other day.

162
00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:04.000
And it seems like maybe we're not always part of history, maybe the 90s, right?

163
00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.000
What was going on the night?

164
00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:09.000
The Berlin Wall came down, so that was kind of historical, but then it was down.

165
00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:15.000
And there was kind of some time where you feel like, how much are we really a part of history that people will be reading about?

166
00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:25.000
And then things happen like what's going on right now and 9-11, and the wars and Iraq and Afghanistan, and you start realizing, no, no, we're unfortunately going to play.

167
00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000
We're going to have our own history as well.

168
00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:37.000
And when you read things like this, it makes a connection for me that you better remember that what's happening, this could always escalate.

169
00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000
Things could always go in a direction that you didn't anticipate.

170
00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:47.000
Little USA can lead to mighty big trouble later down the road. Crazy. Oh yeah.

171
00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:54.000
On May 7th, the epic battle of Denby, Denby and through, ended in a French defeat.

172
00:14:54.000 --> 00:15:03.000
The Vietnamese shot the wounded and marched the ambulatory French to the coast where they were loaded on ships and sent packing back to France.

173
00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:12.000
The French government did not want their citizens to know the defeat and refused to allow their brave soldiers to disembark from the ships.

174
00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:19.000
Many brave French soldiers citizens died in the holes of those ships.

175
00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:40.000
Gmbn few was the first time a non-European colonial independence movement had evolved through all the stages from guerilla bands to a conventionally organized in equipped army able to defeat a modern Western occupier in pitched battle.

176
00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:48.000
On April 22nd, 1957, I turned 12, and announced I was no longer to be called Bosco.

177
00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:55.000
My name is Lynn, and I wanted to be called by my real name. Besides, kids my age were teasing the hell out of me.

178
00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:01.000
We found out my real name. Things got worse. Lynn, what a scissor name.

179
00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:06.000
This began a boy named Sue Aero that never ended. Never.

180
00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.000
So he thought I was, look, everyone's making fun of my nickname Bosco.

181
00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000
That's mean. I'm just going to go with my real name. Lynn.

182
00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:29.000
Yeah. In June of 1963, I graduated from Rainier Beach High School in Seattle, Washington. I was sleeping late on Saturday morning when wake up orders my father shaking my shoulder.

183
00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:36.000
I'm awake. Barely, what's going on? Are you going back to work at the television station, Mom asks?

184
00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:46.000
Not today at Saturday. I give them my best 18-year-old smart ass smile. I quit the station six months before graduation to pay attention to a sagging grade average.

185
00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:51.000
I think I'm going to take the summer and just goof off.

186
00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:57.000
Do you plan on using either your scholarships? My father needles me? Knowing I have no intention of going to college.

187
00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:05.000
I went to college, he chides. Maybe art school, but no college. It would be a waste of my time and everybody's money.

188
00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:11.000
I thought we already had this conversation. I reply, yawning. Don't be a smart ass.

189
00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:18.000
Promise, Mom. Do you have enough money saved up to pay rent, purchase your own food and transportation?

190
00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:24.000
I thought I'd live here during the summer and go back to work in the fall. Then I'll get to play some out. How about that?

191
00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:31.000
If you live here, you'll pay rent. Not the kind of rent you pay now, but the kind of rent as if you had your own place.

192
00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:38.000
You'll be out of money pretty fast. You'll need a job. Understand? You heard what your mother said, father insists.

193
00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:46.000
I don't have the savings to pay that kind of rent. I groggly complain. I would really like to take a break after graduation.

194
00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.000
I take it what you really want is to get me out of the house.

195
00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:55.000
Growing up, both my parents had worked and I was responsible starting at the age of five for taking care of my two brothers.

196
00:17:55.000 --> 00:18:02.000
The little man they called me better than my other name Bosco. I've been working and saved my money since I was 15.

197
00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:09.000
All I want to do is take the summer off, go back to work and then get an apartment. Can't this one wait the summer?

198
00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:15.000
Sounds to me like we aren't looking at the same road map. Mom says firmly.

199
00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:20.000
Both your brothers are old enough to take care of themselves and your father is retired and at home.

200
00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:26.000
This evening is your last free meal here. Understand?

201
00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.000
Yep, sure do.

202
00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:35.000
Start naked. I jump out of bed and bow the head for the shower. Boy, this pisses me off. Why the hell can't they wait until the fall?

203
00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:45.000
When I come out they're gone. I dress, walk a mile to the bus stop and head forward this Seattle Pike Place Market to get something to eat and wander around the open air art galleries.

204
00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:49.000
What am I going to do?

205
00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:57.000
At that point, this is when he goes and he actually meets that recruiter. That's why that recruiter can tell that he's got nowhere to go.

206
00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:02.000
He starts his journey.

207
00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:03.000
So I can King get some in.

208
00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.000
The Sergeant King, man.

209
00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:06.000
The Scored at the diner.

210
00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.000
He made that bill and made his quota.

211
00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.000
Yeah.

212
00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:18.000
He goes continues on here while at Armour School and Airborne recruiter dangles the possibility of an extra 55 years.

213
00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:23.000
And a $55 a month in addition to my meager monthly $79 base pay.

214
00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:28.000
If I am only mad enough to make three parachute jumps.

215
00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.000
Sounds easy as falling out of an airplane.

216
00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:35.000
I volunteer a second time. This volunteering thing is getting to be a habit.

217
00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:39.000
134 monthly for a PFC close along with three huts in a cot.

218
00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:44.000
That's crazy that you guys got that much money for going to Airborne School.

219
00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:48.000
Yeah. It's might not seem like a big deal except for that.

220
00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:53.000
I think I got 110 in like 1990.

221
00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.000
Where my base pay was probably a thousand bucks.

222
00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:57.000
You know what I'm saying?

223
00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:02.000
So it was like one tenth of my base pay where you guys were getting almost double your base pay.

224
00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:07.000
Oh yeah. My case I was getting $50 a week because I'm not sure we're linked at that inflated salary.

225
00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:10.000
Because I was getting 50 in the jump school was $55.

226
00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:15.000
Like 100% plus. Oh man.

227
00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:18.000
So he goes to jump school for Benning, Georgia.

228
00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:18.000
Yeah.

229
00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.000
Which is what I was lucky enough to go.

230
00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.000
They don't send Navy guys there anymore.

231
00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:23.000
Where they send them?

232
00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:24.000
They go to UMA.

233
00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.000
Yeah. They go somewhere else.

234
00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.000
Yeah. UMA are actually my be here in San Diego.

235
00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:32.000
But you basically go and learn it's more of a gentleman's course.

236
00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:32.000
Yeah.

237
00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.000
And it's faster.

238
00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:35.000
And you go.

239
00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.000
You get more experience really quick.

240
00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:37.000
Yeah.

241
00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.000
Because Jeffy Whiskey can be consolidated.

242
00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.000
Oh, you think.

243
00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:43.000
But I had a great time at Airports School.

244
00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:47.000
There was awesome.

245
00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:50.000
And then he goes to a heavy drop school.

246
00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:51.000
Learning.

247
00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:55.000
I guess how to get everything rigged up to throw out of the back of airplanes.

248
00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:56.000
Oh yeah.

249
00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.000
And then he says this after several weeks of rigour training.

250
00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.000
I received orders for Delta Company.

251
00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.000
16th armor.

252
00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:06.000
173rd airborne brigade in Okinawa.

253
00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:10.000
Hey, Okinawa is not a city in Germany.

254
00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:11.000
This is not what I signed up for.

255
00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.000
For an extra 55 bucks a month.

256
00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:16.000
I've blown away a European tour in art education.

257
00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:21.000
But I can rig heavy supply loads and vehicles for such snatchouts at high level drops.

258
00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:24.000
Now there's something I can use in the civilian life.

259
00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:27.000
Black you dumbass.

260
00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:32.000
The 173rd had had been activated in June 1963.

261
00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:36.000
The same month I graduated from Rainier Beach High School in Seattle.

262
00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:41.000
The 173rd has assumed the assets of the second airborne battle group.

263
00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.000
Then station on Okinawa.

264
00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:44.000
Just south of Japan.

265
00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:51.000
But 173rd, the 173rd mission is to quickly close with and destroy the enemy forces using fire, maneuver,

266
00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:56.000
and shock action in coordination with other armed forces.

267
00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:00.000
It was because of its many parachute exercises on Taiwan.

268
00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:07.000
That the members of the 173rd earned the respect and admiration of the nationalist Chinese soldiers.

269
00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:16.000
So impressed with the pair of troopers of the 173rd, where the Chinese that they nicknamed the men of the brigade, Tim Bing, or Sky soldiers.

270
00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.000
The name stuck.

271
00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:25.000
The Pentagon's public expectation of us is that we can be deployed within 24 hours to any hot spot in a Pacific theater.

272
00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:36.000
Engaged with and deter an enemy for 72 hours, this delaying suicidal action would allow time to deploy real forces, such as the Marines.

273
00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:40.000
Thank God there aren't any hot spots to be deployed to.

274
00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:45.000
Thank God this is the peace time army and having no enemy.

275
00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:48.000
Tonight let's go to theville and get drunk.

276
00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.000
We'll watch the strip shows.

277
00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.000
Life's good on the rock.

278
00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:58.000
That's what the jar heads call Okinawa and I'm fast forward and through some other stuff, but he's there.

279
00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.000
You know he's there. He's kind of doing the peace time.

280
00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.000
Army thing.

281
00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:05.000
Living the dream.

282
00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:12.000
March 14th, 1965 is the 19th birthday of Hugh Robert Black, one of my younger brothers.

283
00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:19.000
That morning he arrives on Okinawa with the future third-platoon leader, first lieutenant Richard H. Goldsmith.

284
00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:24.000
PFC Hugh is assigned to the 173rd engineering company. I'm happy to see him.

285
00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:30.000
All the way through school I admired Hugh's scholastic capability and him admittedly

286
00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:35.000
Envious of his high grade point average and seemingly easy learning style.

287
00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:44.000
Both of us have enlisted voluntarily to do our duty and then return to pursue life.

288
00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:47.000
Why the hell didn't I just go to art school?

289
00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:52.000
Because you're doing your duty, dimwit, shut up, put your head down and just get it done.

290
00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:53.000
Stop talking to yourself.

291
00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.000
Well, thank you for the long here permanently.

292
00:23:55.000 --> 00:24:00.000
The ways written as book, he's got all kinds of these italicized sections where he's kind of just given his own thoughts.

293
00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:01.000
Oh yeah.

294
00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:04.000
And they're they're awesome to read.

295
00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:09.000
The rich mind of Lindblig.

296
00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:10.000
Yeah.

297
00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:11.000
It's just funny in the mirror.

298
00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:14.000
What you talk to him about like that stuff there, particular.

299
00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:16.000
His self-examination.

300
00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:19.000
And his commentary is just like, yeah.

301
00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:22.000
And I'm not going to get too much into it.

302
00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:25.000
But the way this book is written, a lot of it is written.

303
00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:31.000
And I'll try and explain a lot of his written as conversations that are debriefs.

304
00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:41.000
Either debriefs official debriefs or unofficial debriefs that you guys have in your team room with beers and plan dice.

305
00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:43.000
And in between stream of consciousness.

306
00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:47.000
Right. He gets a hot street going. He can just hear the keys going.

307
00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.000
He'll take a break for a beer.

308
00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:50.000
He comes back.

309
00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:55.000
Yeah. The atmosphere that he gives out of the team room of you guys is pretty awesome.

310
00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:59.000
And you guys plan, plan, freaking liars dice all the time.

311
00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:04.000
And the little, those little debrief sessions though.

312
00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:08.000
He mentions it. That's how you were learning.

313
00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:09.000
Oh yeah.

314
00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:15.000
That's where you were figuring out what to do and what mistakes this group made and what these guys did right and what they did wrong.

315
00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:20.000
And those those those sessions where you're giving each other a bunch of shit,

316
00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:24.000
but you're also passing valuable information on.

317
00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:27.000
Oh absolutely. Particularly in our early time at FB1.

318
00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:33.000
That's where we learned was from the senior NCOs and any other team member that had been on a ground.

319
00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.000
We faithfully made a point of talking to them.

320
00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:39.000
Some wouldn't, some couldn't, too much trauma.

321
00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:44.000
But the ones who would talk and I mean, Pat Walk and Spiderman parks,

322
00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:47.000
John McGarber near all men that we just admired.

323
00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:50.000
And they took time to talk to us who we could ask some questions.

324
00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:54.000
And then we got the flying cubby. We hear about the mission moment wrong.

325
00:25:54.000 --> 00:26:02.000
Always trying to improve the tactics to see what we could do and improve when we get in the field.

326
00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:05.000
When you did you say when you got to flying cubby?

327
00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:07.000
Well, Spiderman parks became cubby.

328
00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:10.000
Right. Pat Walk can say after time on a ground.

329
00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.000
Got it. They were our best cubby riders. Got it.

330
00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:16.000
And so at the end of 68, particularly with the October 5th mission,

331
00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:18.000
they were both alternating on station.

332
00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:20.000
That day it was so historic.

333
00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:23.000
Part of that historic moment in time.

334
00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:24.000
That mission here.

335
00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:28.000
And so before that, like Dorians of Timber and August,

336
00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:32.000
Pat had run several missions out of FB3 in the layoffs.

337
00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:35.000
And then we'd talk. You always learned stuff.

338
00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:38.000
We just sat there and just tried to sponge it in and bring it in.

339
00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:44.000
Yeah, and we'll get to some of Lines Vietnam experience prior to being in

340
00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:46.000
Sog and prior to being in special forces.

341
00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:50.000
But for someone like you and we talked about this in across the fence.

342
00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:57.000
I mean, it is crazy that you were, how old were you on your first mission?

343
00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:58.000
Twenty two.

344
00:26:58.000 --> 00:26:59.000
Yeah.

345
00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:02.000
Well, I was old by some students.

346
00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:05.000
I spent two years in college trying to fuck out there.

347
00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:12.000
But by August of 68, that's when they finally after that attack at FB4,

348
00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:17.000
they came up with the idea of putting together a one zero school.

349
00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:19.000
So they were trained.

350
00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:23.000
But there was nothing in place. So when we got the food by May and June,

351
00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:27.000
and you just talked to the man who would talk to you.

352
00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:29.000
Anybody had any experience at all?

353
00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:32.000
Like John Walton came back from two of three really bad targets.

354
00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:33.000
We talked to him.

355
00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:35.000
We were both, well, he was a high-powered E4.

356
00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:38.000
I was just a low private.

357
00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:40.000
But anybody who would talk, we talked.

358
00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:41.000
That's where you're right.

359
00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:45.000
That clubhouse was better than anything we could get.

360
00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:48.000
In terms of really learning what was going on on the ground,

361
00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:53.000
the air assets, weather, and the reality of the Kingbees

362
00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:55.000
would be worked with at the time.

363
00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:57.000
It's one thing that's talking about training.

364
00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:58.000
It'll come to come pick you up.

365
00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:02.000
Well, he got his other conditions there.

366
00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:04.000
Man.

367
00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:06.000
You know what that goes.

368
00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:06.000
Yeah.

369
00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:08.000
Crazy.

370
00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:12.000
So now we get to 1965.

371
00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:18.000
And Lynn says somewhere in the middle of April 1965,

372
00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:22.000
cryptic rumors begin to spread rampantly from company around the brigade.

373
00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:28.000
HQ directs all training to cease and practice mountouts be conducted,

374
00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:30.000
which is then basically gearing up to go.

375
00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:31.000
Oh yeah.

376
00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:35.000
Surely the company receives its basic load of live ammunition

377
00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:39.000
and begins to prepare all vehicles for a combat check.

378
00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:44.000
Man, these rounds are heavy and plans one of the new loaders.

379
00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:49.000
April 22nd 1965, he nails these dates in here.

380
00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:53.000
It's like, I would make me wish I would have kept the journal, which I never did.

381
00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:59.000
April 22nd 1965, I celebrate my 20th birthday.

382
00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:03.000
May 2nd, rumors begin to fly as words spread that key personnel

383
00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:08.000
have received advanced party orders to an unknown destination.

384
00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:14.000
May 3rd, company commander Joseph C. Jordan Jr.

385
00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:17.000
at last announces the destination.

386
00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:21.000
And he says, I have just come from general Williamson's morning briefing.

387
00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:27.000
What I'm about to tell you is a chronology of events leading to a temporary offshore assignment.

388
00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:31.000
On April 24th, the general received a top secret message from general West

389
00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:36.000
Morlin to meet him in Saigon, Saigon, South Vietnam, at McVee headquarters.

390
00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:41.000
It seems there's a guerrilla war being waged in that Southeast Asian country.

391
00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:49.000
The 173rd is to be a part of what is called rolling thunder being conducted by the US Air Force out of bases in that country.

392
00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:53.000
What we heard this morning is that the Army of the Republic of Vietnam,

393
00:29:53.000 --> 00:30:00.000
known as the Arvins, are having difficulty providing adequate security for the air bases and supporting rolling thunder raids.

394
00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:05.000
The Arvins are also having difficulty performing offensive operations against the U.S.

395
00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:09.000
operations against the guerrillas known as the Kong or VC.

396
00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:16.000
General Williamson also revealed that several US divisions are scheduled to arrive in South Vietnam within months.

397
00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:23.000
The 173rd's mission is to clear the incoming units proposed base campsites of the VC.

398
00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:28.000
Our deployment will be a temporary one, probably not lasting more than 60 days.

399
00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:36.000
The advanced party will leave for Ben Hoa, Republic of South Vietnam, the 173rd's to conduct a security action.

400
00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:42.000
The CO announces that he thinks we'll be back on Oki, for sure, by Christmas.

401
00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:50.000
Our first mission is to secure patrol and neutralize any threat to Ben Hoa Air Base,

402
00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:53.000
which is our base camp area.

403
00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:57.000
You all now know about as much about this assignment as I do.

404
00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:02.000
So there you go. These guys go from not even knowing that there was anything going on in Vietnam.

405
00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:08.000
They get how different that is now, you know, because when there's some kind of action taking place in the world,

406
00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:10.000
everybody knows about it instantly.

407
00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:14.000
You know about it instantly, because you look at your phone and there's the news.

408
00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:21.000
And whether it's Iraq, Afghanistan, or Somalia, or wherever, everybody knows when there's something happening in the world.

409
00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:26.000
And here these guys, they're not, they have any idea what's happening in Vietnam.

410
00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:31.000
And they're on the rocks. They're not getting in New York Times or any other newspaper that,

411
00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:34.000
but at that time, had carried stories for a few years.

412
00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:40.000
It pissed off pressing the Kennedy, pissed off LBJ, but so they missed that.

413
00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:44.000
So here's Lynn, like, oh, you're going to go to Ben Hoa.

414
00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:47.000
Maybe it'll only be at 60 days, not.

415
00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:54.000
He goes into this thing about how they had to die there under where green.

416
00:31:54.000 --> 00:32:08.000
Yeah. On May 4th, the company receives word, we are to delete nine spats from our inventory and replace them with the M113 Armored Personnel Carriers or APC.

417
00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:11.000
So this is 1965.

418
00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:12.000
Yeah.

419
00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:17.000
And you know what we use for a cast of AC vehicles in the Battle of Vermont in 2006.

420
00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:19.000
M113. M113.

421
00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:22.000
Which almost any bullet could still penetrate.

422
00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:29.000
Yeah. My commanding officer of one time, you know, he's, he was talking me through an operation that the guys were going out on.

423
00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:31.000
And he said, what's the cast of AC plan?

424
00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:35.000
I said, hey, the cast of AC plan is this. We're contact this company. They have one, one, three.

425
00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:42.000
They'll come out. And he says, what if, what if that, one, one, three, hit to subsurface ID.

426
00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:46.000
So at the time, subsurface ID had it.

427
00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:54.000
Everybody knew what that wasn't what it was. Was somebody, the enemy would bury the, the explosives, you know, underneath the ground and you couldn't see them.

428
00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:59.000
So it wasn't like something sitting on the side of the road. It was under the ground and they would make them big.

429
00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:06.000
And he says, what, what'll happen if that one, one, three hits a, hits a subsurface ID.

430
00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:10.000
And I said, surf, the one, one, three hits a subsurface ID.

431
00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:14.000
Everyone in that one, one, three is going to be dead. And that was the facts.

432
00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:16.000
It's going to be their cast.

433
00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:25.000
The really weird thing is, most, at that time, including the one, one, three, the Abrams, all these older vehicles,

434
00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:31.000
the, when you build those vehicles, you build them as low as the to the ground as you can. It's the lowest possible profile.

435
00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:36.000
So that you can't be seen. It's like ducking, right? You build the even a home, these built like that, right?

436
00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:38.000
A home, these wide, but it's low.

437
00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:43.000
Sure. And an, and an Abrams is, is wide, but it's low. And a one, one, three is low to the ground.

438
00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:52.000
They're how much clearance. Because, you know, you don't want to get shot at by another tank. So you can hide behind, you know, little ridge line or a little nole or something like that.

439
00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:58.000
The problem is that's the worst possible vehicle to have when it comes to getting blown up from the ground.

440
00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:05.000
And so now, when you see the, the mind resistant vehicles now, they're massive, they're tall. You've got to get a lot, you get into them with a ladder.

441
00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:12.000
You literally, there's a ladder. There's like, four or five runs on a ladder to get up into them because they're built really high.

442
00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:22.000
You exit with a parachute. Yeah. They have a V-shaped hole that deflects the blast as well. And a one, one, three has a complete flat bottom.

443
00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:30.000
It's super low to the ground, but they were just, they weren't, this was not the problem that they were coming up against at that time.

444
00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:52.000
Yeah. May 5th, the company begins feverishly working to prepare our vehicles for shipment the following day. May 6th, we arrived to Okinawa to the Okinawa port of Nathah, where the vehicles are loaded under the direction of Lieutenant Gilmore, the embarkation officer.

445
00:34:52.000 --> 00:35:03.000
And again, I'm just chomped them through this stuff. You got, it's so great to read this. You got to get this book because the details that it gives, I don't know how he's got a way better memory than me, right?

446
00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:11.000
Dates or lockdown names it for everyone. I mean, who remembers the name of the damn embarkation officer? He must have written that down.

447
00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:23.000
But it's great, it makes you feel like you're there. You're right there. Perfect. The 173rd Airborne Brigade is the first US Army unit sent to Vietnam.

448
00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:37.000
Can you imagine? So talking about history. Oh yeah. May 12th, the 12th, 16 hours company D, 16th armor arrives in Saigon Harbor, the Paris of Southeast Asia.

449
00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:48.000
Company D's first combat assignment comes in the form of ambush patrols, where order to attach 12 in this personnel each day to the first the 503rd for a three day period.

450
00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:54.000
So much for riding on tracks. So they got all these vehicles, but now they're going out on patrols.

451
00:35:54.000 --> 00:36:03.000
Needs of the army. Do they say needs of the army? No. Okay, in the Navy, that's like a kind of a joke. Someone will say, well, what do you think your job's gonna be? It's like, well, needs of the Navy.

452
00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:10.000
Whatever the Navy needs you to do, you're gonna do. And even though they might not say that in the army, that's the way it is.

453
00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:17.000
Because we don't care if you've been training on these tracks to fight from armor, you're gonna go out. You're gonna be on foot patrol.

454
00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:22.000
May 18th, our vehicles arrive and the company turns to the task of prepping them.

455
00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:29.000
Thank God now. Now maybe we can start doing stop doing patrols with the grunts. I'm an armor guy, not a ground pounder.

456
00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:37.000
One track crew member of complaints, and here's Linda's thoughts. I disagree with that. No one in the right mind wants to be walking this miserable place when you can be riding.

457
00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:43.000
Oh, sorry. I agree with that. No one in the right mind wants to be walking this miserable place when you can be riding.

458
00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:50.000
Who the hell wants to sleep on the stinking wet ground with bugs, snakes, and god knows what else? God damn it. I'm supposed to be in Europe.

459
00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:55.000
Who's the power of Saudi Arabia?

460
00:36:55.000 --> 00:37:02.000
May 19th, the first platoon is attached to the 333, 319th artillery for security mission.

461
00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:08.000
The remainder of the month is spent training and seemingly endless improvement of the defensive perimeter.

462
00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:21.000
Here's, here's Lynn's thoughts. Dig endless trenches, trenches, fill sandbags, build bunkers, string concertino wire, put up tents, wind and rain, flood the trenches, and bunkers and flat in the tents.

463
00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:29.000
Again, go out and patrol with ground pounders, pull KP, stand guard duty. How in the hell can any of these lifers do this for a living?

464
00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:34.000
I'm so tired of pots and pans, duty, I could kill somebody. There's a thought.

465
00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:40.000
So that's how they psychologically prepare us. Potts and pans.

466
00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:44.000
On the last day of May, General Williamson initiated a four-day operation.

467
00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:52.000
Three objectives were hit by our sky soldiers. Casualties were few against light resistance. The war guys experienced no heavy fighting.

468
00:37:52.000 --> 00:38:04.000
The operation, the first U.S. offensive action in Viet South Vietnam greatly contributed to the confidence of the 173rd airborne brigade.

469
00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:12.000
The first operation of July is searching destroy in conjunction with elements of the first battalion, 513th infantry.

470
00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:21.000
July 16th the company in conjunction with elements the first the 513th and the engineering company conducted search and destroy operation.

471
00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:29.000
During that operation, my younger brother Hugh is critically wounded by an unseen enemy during a mortar attack.

472
00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:35.000
And several of his friends are killed. He's met a back out of the AO and back to Cones.

473
00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:43.000
So, you know, I kind of drifted through that part where his brother showed up on Ocanawa. Well, his brother, they're both at the same unit.

474
00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:50.000
They end up deploying to Vietnam, the first Americans in Vietnam, and his brother ends up getting wounded by a mortar pretty bad.

475
00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:58.000
And here's Lynn's thoughts on that. You fuckers, not my brother, not my brother show yourselves you cowards. Got gamut.

476
00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:02.000
Here we are driving up and down the roads while those bastards are hiding in the bushes.

477
00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:15.000
They can see us, but we can't see them. Where the hell are they? Somebody has to know where they are. I'm sorry Hugh. I hope you can forgive me. I should have been there with you. I'll find them. They'll pay. I promise.

478
00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:18.000
Welcome to the jungle, baby.

479
00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:42.000
That's one of the things that, you know, when I was in Ramadi, I'd always read the book about face, you know, by David Hackworth and one of the things that was so similar was what just happened right there. This is the beginning of the war.

480
00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:54.000
And you're fighting against an enemy that you can't see, right? And it's so frustrating, especially for the conventional troops that are out there and, and you know, I was talking about this today with a client.

481
00:39:54.000 --> 00:40:03.000
The, the mentality and what it does to your mentality of being on offense versus being on defense.

482
00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:24.000
And when you got on to a, when they, when you know when, when the mission is go out and walk down this road, you might think you're being on offense, but if you think about it a little bit deeper, you're on defense, because you're walking down that road, and they can have booby traps and IEDs and snipers and mortgurs, they can have all that stuff and you are on defense, even though you're moving, you're on defense.

483
00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:38.000
And that was definitely how I felt on my first deployment, same thing I would ask like young junior officers, I'd say, is this an offensive operation, I talk about a direct action mission and downtown Baghdad, I've shown a profile of a mission.

484
00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:44.000
And I'd say, is this an offensive operation, they go absolutely, and I go, how long are you on offense for?

485
00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:55.000
Because the whole mission takes an hour and a half to hours, right? So you drive from Baghdad to some other part of Baghdad, it takes you half an hour to get there.

486
00:40:55.000 --> 00:41:04.000
And then you hit the target, it takes 15 minutes, and then you drive back to another half an hour. So you were out for an hour and 15 minutes, I would say, how much time were you on offense for?

487
00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:09.000
And then they'd start thinking about it, sometimes they'd say the whole time we're always on offense.

488
00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:19.000
And I'd say, well, that sounds good, but it's not true. It's not true. When you're out on patrol, when you're moving through enemy territory, you are on defense.

489
00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:27.000
You're a target. You're a target. Now, once you get to that target, and you set up, believe me, we go on offense for a good solid three or four minutes.

490
00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:33.000
But then even once we hit the target, now all the bad guys know where they're. And now we're on defense again.

491
00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:42.000
So that what that does to your mentality is it can be hard on people. It can be hard to be constantly paranoid and constantly on defense.

492
00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:50.000
And it's the same thing in life, right? You know, somebody was asking me, what are you doing? What do you do when you've got all these things are happening in the markets changing?

493
00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:58.000
And I said, look, you can either be on defense, try just keep it together, which doesn't feel good, or you can look at the problem and go on offense and attack the problem.

494
00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:05.000
And that's exactly the mentality that Lins haven't right here. He wants to go on the attack. Oh, yeah. Absolutely.

495
00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:06.000
Hmm.

496
00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:20.000
Continuing on the 173rd along with other American units and Vietnamese troops, work together to break the siege of special forces at camp, do, do, co.

497
00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:37.000
My saying that right, do, co, do, co. Captain Jordan, the Delta Company commander leads his company on foot patrols to an exploit to exploit a suspected VC stronghold, as well as other armored patrols and security details.

498
00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:47.000
Sir, Captain Jordan, let me go go with you on the patrols. No black. You aren't in any shape to be going with us. I need soldiers not to revenge squad.

499
00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:57.000
Yeah. So blacks get in left behind and he wants to go get after it. And his boss is saying, you just need to, you need to slow your roll black.

500
00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:09.000
August 6th company D, fairies the Royal Australian Regiment infantry to their area of operations. August 17th, the second and third platoons along with command track, lead for extended operation.

501
00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:28.000
September 9th, 1965, Captain Joseph C. Jordan, the Lankuces is command for a staff position with a great brigade HQ, Captain John E. Dunlop, junior formally HQ company commander is recipient of the guide on.

502
00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:47.000
On patrol, platoon sergeant Herman Trent, spec five, career PFCs, Henry S. Baker and Robert L. Adams are all wounded when they come under heavy mortar fire by the still unseen enemy.

503
00:43:47.000 --> 00:44:06.000
The spec four Craig is credited with saving two lives and later receives the soldier's metal combination October 8th, 1965 company D departs are Ben Howa base for the iron triangle on a search and destroy operation.

504
00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:24.000
The far down the road around the first Ben to command detonated mine is set off by the VC completely destroying the APC killing the driver PFC, Michael Broncato and severely wounding staff sergeant St. Claire, Westernman and Samson Moore.

505
00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:36.000
Son of bitches blew us up Westernman later slurs through his wired jaws he's trying to explain to me what happened blew the goddamn track off the PC and flipped it upside down killed Broncato.

506
00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:38.000
Good kid.

507
00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:40.000
God damn it.

508
00:44:40.000 --> 00:45:05.000
On an on it went war zone C and D the iron triangle, op plans new life and smash and December search and destroy and convoy security along with blocking force missions that first tour of duty rolled on much the same way as it did the first six months until specialist fourth class Lynn M black junior got promoted.

509
00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:19.000
Then I went back to the world in July of 1966 later that year I appeared on a television morning show hosted by a guy named Princeton Preston Price at King TV Seattle Washington.

510
00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:21.000
So here is his out of the army.

511
00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:35.000
With me was an army helicopter gunner who would become a war protester the door gunners mantra for the 30 minute show was that the United States had no business being in southeast Asia.

512
00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:53.000
He didn't believe that any young man of draft age had any responsibility to fight and illegal war we needed to question the use of illegal authority.

513
00:45:53.000 --> 00:46:05.000
He was not the same to any man.

514
00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:09.000
It certainly did me.

515
00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:22.000
What I wanted to do was kick the unseen enemies ass for lacking he did make a den in the door gunners resolve and the two of us morning show guests began to talk over the top of one another as the lights were switched off in the studio and the station went into a prolonged set of live beer and appliance dealer commercials in an adjacent studio.

516
00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:26.000
I held several of my fellow soldiers and had severely wounded many more.

517
00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:34.000
My brother and my best friend had been crippled for life or growtestly wounded. I can't say for sure I ever saw the face of the enemy during that tour of duty.

518
00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:45.000
Sitting in my apartment in Hawaii watching the evening news I felt guilty pissed off alone and completely consumed by feelings of revenge.

519
00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:57.000
The best planes began bombing a noise. We see you now you sons of bitches North Vietnam declared general mobilization the war saw packed promises to support North Vietnam.

520
00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:03.000
Whiskey tango fox truck. I'm reenlisting.

521
00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:15.000
If anyone hasn't figured out what WTF Whiskey tango fox truck stands for it stands for what the fuck over.

522
00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:27.000
So that's his first tour of duty and it's crazy to think he's saying hey I don't even think I ever saw the enemy during that and he's got his brother wounded. He's got other guys wounded and killed never saw the enemy.

523
00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:41.000
Yeah and they had a couple times I forget how detailed he went in that first part but when they were in the APCs they got into the rubber plantations.

524
00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:50.000
We had rows and rows of trees. You go in there and hey man we can figure it out what they didn't and they got hammered in here.

525
00:47:50.000 --> 00:48:00.000
I remember when talking about that both in both tours of duty and some point we got into a reflection thing. We go back once the war but the rubber plantations.

526
00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:09.000
And they between snipers and their control fire lanes and obviously they set things up for practice before the hundred seventy-three ever got there.

527
00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:22.000
And then they had to be careful not to damage any rubber trees because they did the plantation owners would come back and suit the United States of pay for the damaged rubber trees.

528
00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:37.000
And that story and the APCs that thinned armor. Oh yeah some nightmare. I just can't imagine. And that's a traditional unit. Yeah early on and they learned some lessons the hard way. Boy.

529
00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:52.000
And I know that when I did Lewis Polar, Jr.'s book on here, fortunate son and he's rotating between three areas and you know like one of them was bridge security.

530
00:48:52.000 --> 00:49:08.000
One of them was camp security and then one of them was called the Riviera I think or the Rivera. But every time they go out there they'd take take casualties and they'd never see the enemy. And they would do a high five with you know their platoon was heading out. There's another platoon rotating back in.

531
00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:21.000
I figured it was platoon or company. I think it was platoon platoon size. He'd be heading out and he'd high five you know the other platoon commander and you know the guy'd say yeah we took two casualties of three casualties we cast it back them out did you see the enemy nope.

532
00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:39.000
There's going out there and taking hits and you don't see the enemy. And that's very similar to Iraq you know very similar to Iraq where many much of the time guys be out there they just get blown up by an idea or you can hit by mortifier you can hit by sniper fire.

533
00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:51.000
And that's that's the way that's the way the guerrillas fight against against America absolutely and then even with the snipers they knew how to get back into building so they fired out.

534
00:49:51.000 --> 00:50:01.000
There'd be no direct smoke or evidence of them where the rounds came from you really had to have a good ear detection or some kind of sensor.

535
00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:15.000
Yeah, you can't tell if you're out there coming from. And you see you see in movies you know there's always a sniper in a window and his barrel stick and two feet out of the window.

536
00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:28.000
But you're right the snipers are actually not even in that room. They're in a room deep one room deep maybe even more down a hallway. So they're field vision is tiny but you there's no possible way that you're seeing them.

537
00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:38.000
But luckily some people learn to adapt and take the fight to the enemy. Indeed.

538
00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:55.000
July 1968 and these are some thoughts during my first tour with the 173rd I watched them special forces and other recon man from the herd which is the nickname which is a great nickname for the 173rd the herd.

539
00:50:55.000 --> 00:51:03.000
From the herd marine force recon the 80 second and the 101st airborne divisions. There's something different special about recon man.

540
00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:08.000
I can't quite put my finger on it but I sure as hell want to be one.

541
00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:18.000
Intense yet always joking around it was like they were fighting a different war than the rest of us. Everyone knew they were the best to the best.

542
00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:25.000
We graduated from company B special forces training group for Bragg North Carolina at the beginning of the class.

543
00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:35.000
Had been 500 of the finest physically fit soldiers ever produced in the United States Army. That may 1968 graduating class contained less than 70 men.

544
00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:43.000
Standing at attention proudly waiting to be awarded the coveted green beret. When did you graduate from special forces training?

545
00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:45.000
December 67.

546
00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:49.000
So you're already done and he's a new guy.

547
00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:50.000
Yeah.

548
00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:55.000
I'm in camp. I'm going to be one waiting for him to get there.

549
00:51:55.000 --> 00:52:00.000
We had earned the right to work with the best of the best hell we were the best.

550
00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:10.000
He just runs through some of the special forces training back then. In the beginning phase one we sat in the classroom for eight hours a day listening to lectures and taking notes.

551
00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:19.000
We were given homework assignments papers to write and participate in a small in class and after class working teams half the group was eliminated in phase one.

552
00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:24.000
Every day we heard phrase like if I wanted to sit on my ass all day in the classroom I'd join the air force.

553
00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:35.000
This is college prep school. This is college prep school nonsense a lot nonsense a lot of what it took to get through phase one was attitude of willingness being willing to adore the unexpected.

554
00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:40.000
I don't think any of us expected the classroom. Did you spend that much time in the classroom?

555
00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:41.000
Yeah.

556
00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:43.000
What were you guys learning about?

557
00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:46.000
Well, they they all the indoctrination stuff.

558
00:52:46.000 --> 00:53:00.000
The history and then um procedures then like our commoclass you sat down here in that class for eight to ten hours just taking commo and uh land navigational kinds of different things like that.

559
00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:10.000
I take notes I can remember while packing to move now going through a fine of some of my old notes back there's like oh my god I figure all about that that's like I got it out of my mind.

560
00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:17.000
When you find those notes just take a picture of them and send them to me so we can talk about them at some point that sounds freaking awesome.

561
00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:27.000
I got this book that I wrote when I was a e5 in the seal teams and I was teaching college teaching communications and I found it.

562
00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:36.000
It just says seal team one communications and it's basically on how to work with different radios, but then in the back I have a section called lessons learned.

563
00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:39.000
I'm going to cover it on the podcast because it's legit.

564
00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:40.000
Is that right?

565
00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:41.000
Yeah.

566
00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:43.000
Maybe we have to go back and compare notes.

567
00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:45.000
I did got a little more scoat training.

568
00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:48.000
Oh, I was one of the last guys that had to learn more scoat.

569
00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:50.000
Yeah, did he done dumb, did he?

570
00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:51.000
Yeah.

571
00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:58.000
My the guy that was teaching us to it because there's people that were pushing back like we don't need to learn more scoat and we have satellites now.

572
00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:05.000
And this guy says in the event of what was his phrase he said in the event of a nuclear war.

573
00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:10.000
The only thing that's going to be punching through the ionosphere is HF coms.

574
00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:11.000
Yeah.

575
00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:12.000
And Morris code.

576
00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:13.000
So we got to learn it.

577
00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:15.000
Of course I'm 19 years old.

578
00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:16.000
I'm totally down.

579
00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:17.000
I'm like cool.

580
00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:20.000
If there's a nuclear war, I'm ready to make coms.

581
00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:21.000
Yeah.

582
00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:24.000
They don't teach you.

583
00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:27.000
It in basic civil training.

584
00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:31.000
There is no meddle of challenge whatsoever.

585
00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:33.000
I mean, there's no you don't sit in a classroom.

586
00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:41.000
You don't sit in a classroom probably ever for more than like an hour when they're trying to teach you dive physics or

587
00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:43.000
hydrographic reconnaissance.

588
00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:45.000
It's just totally.

589
00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:46.000
They don't do that with us.

590
00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:49.000
That's why you get some knuckle draggers and teams.

591
00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:50.000
Yeah.

592
00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:56.000
You know, the special forces guy just, you know, they like that.

593
00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:58.000
They like that kind of thing.

594
00:54:58.000 --> 00:54:59.000
They like that kind of thing.

595
00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:04.000
Be a little bit smarter.

596
00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:07.000
During phase two, we were divided amongst our various specialty groups such as operations

597
00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:08.000
intelligence, medical weapons.

598
00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:09.000
And so on.

599
00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:10.000
I was the hands-on portion training.

600
00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:17.000
In my case, I was being trained as a weapons specialist, which I imagine everybody wants to be.

601
00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:18.000
Oh yeah.

602
00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:21.000
Boy toys to the max.

603
00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:22.000
Yeah.

604
00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:24.000
And how do they pick what you're going to do?

605
00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:29.000
They gave you tests and then just pose an indicate what you're good at.

606
00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:31.000
And then there's needs, what the army needs.

607
00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:32.000
Needs in the army.

608
00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:34.000
And you ended up comms.

609
00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:35.000
Yeah.

610
00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:37.000
I ended up comms too.

611
00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:43.000
Because I had this, I stood watch at the seal team one quarter deck.

612
00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:45.000
Like a new guy, you're going to stand watch.

613
00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:49.000
And so I'm standing watch.

614
00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:51.000
I'm standing with this officer.

615
00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:53.000
He's a like a platoon commander.

616
00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:56.000
But he's more experienced than me.

617
00:55:56.000 --> 00:55:57.000
And he's talking to me.

618
00:55:57.000 --> 00:55:59.000
We have to stay there the whole night.

619
00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:02.000
You know, we're like steeping in a bunk beds or whatever to make sure no one attacks seal team one.

620
00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:03.000
That's like 1991.

621
00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:05.000
And the guy after talking to me, he says, you know what?

622
00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:06.000
You know what?

623
00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:07.000
He's asking me, what's what he would do?

624
00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:08.000
What are you doing?

625
00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:10.000
The seal teams were like, you know, want to be an operator.

626
00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:11.000
Want to go on missions, right?

627
00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:12.000
And he's the morning.

628
00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:14.000
He says, hey, you know what?

629
00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:22.000
You should do is you should go to the radio room tomorrow or when you when we get off and go tell

630
00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:26.000
you want to be a radio man because the radio man always goes on operations.

631
00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:29.000
Is the only guy that's going on every operation.

632
00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:33.000
Mean, the medic kind of, but the radio man for sure.

633
00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:34.000
Have to.

634
00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:37.000
And so I went up, got off a watch went right up, banged on the radio.

635
00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:38.000
I want to be a radio man.

636
00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:39.000
Why?

637
00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:40.000
I want to go on every operation.

638
00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:41.000
Cool.

639
00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:42.000
And I don't sign up here.

640
00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:46.000
Only person in the history of sealed team wanted to do that because what does everyone else want to do?

641
00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:48.000
They want to be a machine gunner and a sniper.

642
00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:49.000
Oh, yeah.

643
00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:51.000
One of the weapons guy.

644
00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:52.000
Uh.

645
00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:56.000
So fast forward a little bit.

646
00:56:56.000 --> 00:56:59.000
He's home in Seattle on leave.

647
00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:02.000
He's got some of this SF buddies with him.

648
00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:04.000
Uh, named Bob and Steve.

649
00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:07.000
And here they are kind of hanging out with Hugh.

650
00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:08.000
And here we go.

651
00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:11.000
Hugh, one of my two younger brothers has joined us during our left.

652
00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:15.000
Last afternoon out on our sister Carlos back deck.

653
00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:17.000
This is our last day in the civilian world.

654
00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:19.000
This is before they go on deployment.

655
00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:23.000
He's wearing a tank top and t-shirt and a pair of shorts,

656
00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:28.000
which shows off the scar running from one knee up the length of his leg to his hip.

657
00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:32.000
After a couple beers, he tells the story about the mortar attack.

658
00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:37.000
His leg wound broken ribs, arm and trappin' old, filled face and torso.

659
00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:40.000
He recounts the month spent recovering at the last night.

660
00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:44.000
He's recovering at Madagin Army Hospital.

661
00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:48.000
Bob and Steve are visibly shaken by the sight of wounds.

662
00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:52.000
And more so by the story of inadequate medical treatment and

663
00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:55.000
disdain from the hospital staff or anyone dumb enough to get

664
00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:58.000
suckered into volunteering for nomb.

665
00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:05.000
The mood of the afternoon, darkens and alcohol consumption increases.

666
00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:07.000
Last day, go let softly drones.

667
00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:11.000
How do you say this and get in Gelke?

668
00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:12.000
How do you say his name?

669
00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:13.000
Angleke.

670
00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:14.000
Angleke.

671
00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:16.000
Steve Angleke and Bob.

672
00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:18.000
Those are his two bodies.

673
00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:19.000
Oh yeah.

674
00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:20.000
Oh, it's Gelke.

675
00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:22.000
Angleke.

676
00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:24.000
Angleke.

677
00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:25.000
Angleke.

678
00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:26.000
Man, I'm gonna keep messing that one.

679
00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:27.000
Angleke.

680
00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:28.000
Stick with Steve.

681
00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:34.000
Carlos serves up in early dinner.

682
00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:38.000
The last supper and Hugh bluntly asks, what the hell are you going to do?

683
00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:40.000
Back in that shit hole.

684
00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:44.000
For a moment I sit there surprised staring at him, dumbfounded.

685
00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:46.000
It's payback time.

686
00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:49.000
I quietly reply, payback for what?

687
00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:51.000
He looks surprised then it dawns on him.

688
00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:55.000
You dumbass, you aren't my babysitter, my big brother anymore.

689
00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:57.000
I don't need you to fight any battles on my behalf.

690
00:58:57.000 --> 00:59:00.000
I did my duty took my hits and now I'm going to college.

691
00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:02.000
It's time for me to build my life.

692
00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:10.000
The government got there three years and you can bet your bipy that there's no one in this country who gives a shit except those who went there and did it.

693
00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:13.000
Sometimes I'm not sure most of them care either.

694
00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:15.000
Time to move on, brother.

695
00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:16.000
Time to move on.

696
00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:18.000
Grab me one of those beers out of the cooler.

697
00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:20.000
Will you stupid idiot?

698
00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:24.000
Here's Lund's thoughts on that.

699
00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:28.000
Now that announcement certainly shoots the shit out of my public reason for going back.

700
00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:33.000
I've been telling everyone who asked that I'm going to extract a little hide from the Charlie's who nailed my little brother.

701
00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:38.000
Now he's telling me he's not my little brother and to grow up.

702
00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:42.000
Well, crap, why the hell did he make that speech before I re-enlisted?

703
00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:46.000
Laughing to myself, I'm a green beret.

704
00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:48.000
I'm going to be a recon man.

705
00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:49.000
That's why I'm going back.

706
00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:53.000
I want to find out what it's like to be the best at something.

707
00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:58.000
Fast forward, denying safe house 22.

708
00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:07.000
The three of us anxiously await a top secret briefing in a small secured out building that once was a carriage house.

709
01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:17.000
A sergeant first class, E7 is standing behind a long wide thick plank table behind him, a captain wearing the green beret in a starched uniform sits quietly watching.

710
01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:21.000
With an off-handed Rolex gesture so typical of SF men.

711
01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:24.000
The E7 motions to us to sit.

712
01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:33.000
Rising from his chair, the captain says, during your training at Bragg, you men were selected as potential candidates for military assistance command,

713
01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:36.000
Vietnam studies and observations group.

714
01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
Studies and observations.

715
01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:39.000
What the hell is that?

716
01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
God damn it, I came back to be a recon man.

717
01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:44.000
Sounds like they're going to make us into a bunch of clerks.

718
01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:47.000
I will give you a series of briefings.

719
01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:51.000
The first of which requires you to make a decision as to whether you want to go on with the second.

720
01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:56.000
Before we continue what you are about to hear is classified top secret.

721
01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:59.000
Requiring you to sign the nondisclosure form in front of you.

722
01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:02.000
Read the form if you choose not to sign, get up and leave the room.

723
01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
No questions asked.

724
01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:05.000
Read the form.

725
01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:08.000
Okay, sign the form and give it to the E7.

726
01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
This better not be a clerks job.

727
01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
Top secret clerk.

728
01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:16.000
I read the form and scribble my signature at the bottom, handing it to the E7.

729
01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:20.000
As he circulates among us.

730
01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:21.000
I know this is a lot of it.

731
01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
And he goes through some history.

732
01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:27.000
That's what's part of the briefing is.

733
01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:31.000
He says this four years ago, April 1964,

734
01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:41.000
the government of South Vietnam created the special exploitation service or SES to replace the VN special forces command.

735
01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:51.000
Concurrently, the CIA transferred its advisory role to the newly formed military assistance command Vietnam studies an observations group or Mac Vesog,

736
01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:55.000
which is run by the US military joint services.

737
01:01:55.000 --> 01:02:02.000
Last year the South Vietnamese renamed the SES the strategic technical directorate.

738
01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:07.000
Clearing his throat, the captain picks up a glass of water taking along drink.

739
01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:11.000
And why do I need to know all this? Questions? No? Okay, to the point.

740
01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000
Human will be assigned to an FOB.

741
01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:18.000
Forward operations base or FOBs have been in existence since 1964.

742
01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:24.000
They are located in FUBai, K-Son, Com, Duke, and Denang.

743
01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:29.000
FOBs conduct classified operations outside South Vietnam.

744
01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:32.000
Classified operations doesn't sound like a clerks job to me.

745
01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:35.000
This is getting interesting.

746
01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:47.000
But operations in the Louss commenced September 1965 as part of Operation Shining Brass and recently have been renamed Prairie Fire.

747
01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:56.000
Out of country operations are conducted by recon teams called Spike Teams, Hatchett Forces and Slam companies.

748
01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:01.000
Break those downforce real quick. Spike Teams, Hatchett Forces and...

749
01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:11.000
And there's also RT which is recon team. Well in the early days, up until the end of 1968, it was Spike Team because it was top secret code for recon team.

750
01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:20.000
Got it. And then you had to hatch a force which could be anything for a patoon up to a company-sized operation like Operation Tailwind.

751
01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:27.000
And then the Slam operations that would be one or two hatched force components depending on the size.

752
01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:33.000
They would go in and block the Ho Chi-Mintrial. Back it up and then the Air Force would have air power.

753
01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:37.000
So anything that backed up on the trail, they would hit it hard.

754
01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:43.000
And of course the NVA responded very quickly and the LMS that were on the ground got hammered.

755
01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:49.000
So Slam got Slam but those operations. That's why by the time you get the tailwind in 70, they changed the M-O.

756
01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:52.000
A little bit but that's the breakdown.

757
01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:53.000
Got it.

758
01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:58.000
This Captain continues on Mac Vsau.

759
01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:09.000
Mac Vsaug is a joint service high command unconventional warfare task force whose charters to conduct top secret sabotage, psychological and special operations.

760
01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:14.000
In North and South Vietnam, Lousy Cambodia and Southern China.

761
01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:18.000
It has been given the title studies and observation group as a cover.

762
01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:23.000
The joint staff is allegedly performing an analysis of the lessons learned up to this point in the war.

763
01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:26.000
It's obviously a special operations group.

764
01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:30.000
Mac Vsaug is organized into two field commands.

765
01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:39.000
Command and control south and north also called CCS and CCN.

766
01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000
I know this is a lot of material and I'm jumping ahead.

767
01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:46.000
I know this is a lot of material but we want you to know what you're volunteering for.

768
01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:51.000
To continue and he keeps the throughout this in wind doesn't actually limit says this.

769
01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:54.000
I volunteered to be here. I volunteered for recon.

770
01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:59.000
Sounds like I'm getting exactly what I asked for.

771
01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
How old is this limit at this point?

772
01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:02.000
It's 1975.

773
01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:03.000
No, at this point.

774
01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
Oh there.

775
01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:10.000
He must be young because he didn't do, oh no, he did it a point in with the R.

776
01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
He's older actually.

777
01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
He's actually probably older than you.

778
01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
Probably. I was 22. I think Lim would have been.

779
01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:17.000
He's a year ahead of me.

780
01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:18.000
Okay.

781
01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:18.000
Yeah.

782
01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
He's 75 now on four.

783
01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
There you go.

784
01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:25.000
Um, but still damn that's young.

785
01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
But you know why?

786
01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:31.000
The reason I ask you that is because when I think about what a young,

787
01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
um,

788
01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:39.000
American male mind is like,

789
01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:40.000
it's like this.

790
01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
You're sitting here and you,

791
01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:45.000
there's nothing more than anyone wants to hear than,

792
01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000
uh,

793
01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
joint service high command,

794
01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
unconventional warfare task force

795
01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:54.000
whose chargers to conduct top secret sabotage

796
01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
psychological and special operations.

797
01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:57.000
Sign me up.

798
01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:58.000
There we go.

799
01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
Airborne.

800
01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
Uh,

801
01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:05.000
continuing on MacVee's mission is twofold.

802
01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:08.000
Support South Vietnam against communist aggression,

803
01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
assistant and development of the Southern Republic.

804
01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:13.000
The United States and our allies will succeed by winning the people,

805
01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000
depriving the enemy of safe havens,

806
01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:18.000
rests and supplies depriving the enemy.

807
01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
Um,

808
01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:24.000
and this is where MacVee's saw comes into the picture.

809
01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:29.000
Saug has five primary responsibilities and the capability to undertake

810
01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
additional special missions as required.

811
01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:32.000
Listen up,

812
01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:35.000
Saug's primary responsibilities include first.

813
01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:38.000
Cross-border operations conducted to disrupt

814
01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
flare-rush,

815
01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:41.000
path that.

816
01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:42.000
Path that?

817
01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:47.000
Path out loud and NVA in their own territories.

818
01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000
So that's Cambodia,

819
01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:50.000
laus,

820
01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:53.000
and NVN north Vietnam

821
01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:54.000
Secondly,

822
01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:58.000
keep track of all the imprisoned and missing Americans

823
01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:02.000
and conducting raids to assist and free them as part of the escape of an

824
01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:05.000
invasion mission for all captured US ground personnel and down to airmen.

825
01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
Mission three is training and dispatching agents in the North Vietnam to

826
01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:13.24
in the North Vietnam to run resistance operations called black psychological operations

827
01:07:13.24 --> 01:07:18.96
such as establishing false national NVA broadcasting stations inside North Vietnam and yellow

828
01:07:18.96 --> 01:07:25.72
psychological operations as typified by the hue, the way Citadel propaganda transmitter

829
01:07:25.72 --> 01:07:27.28
mentioned earlier.

830
01:07:27.28 --> 01:07:31.16
Four, the captain holds up four fingers waving them at us.

831
01:07:31.16 --> 01:07:36.12
Mac Vsaga is also entrusted with specific tasks such as kidnapping, assassination, and

832
01:07:36.12 --> 01:07:41.76
insertion of rigged mortar rounds into enemy ammunition supply system which are set to

833
01:07:41.76 --> 01:07:45.24
explode and destroy their crews upon use.

834
01:07:45.24 --> 01:07:47.36
He pauses to study our faces.

835
01:07:47.36 --> 01:07:49.000
Again clearing his throat.

836
01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:54.08
Five, he coughs again is the retrieval of sensitive documents and equipment if lost or captured

837
01:07:54.08 --> 01:07:55.84
through enemy action.

838
01:07:55.84 --> 01:07:56.84
He pauses.

839
01:07:56.84 --> 01:07:58.56
Any questions?

840
01:07:58.56 --> 01:08:03.32
Silence in the room.

841
01:08:03.32 --> 01:08:06.76
And thanks to himself, this is a hell of a lot more than just recon.

842
01:08:06.76 --> 01:08:10.72
Wow.

843
01:08:10.72 --> 01:08:13.84
The next level of information reveals daily operational details.

844
01:08:13.84 --> 01:08:19.08
I will show you out of the country areas of operations, talk and detail about the team

845
01:08:19.08 --> 01:08:23.04
make up and the commitment we hope you will volunteer to make.

846
01:08:23.04 --> 01:08:25.60
Any of you who want to bail out now is the time.

847
01:08:25.60 --> 01:08:27.96
He pauses looking around the room.

848
01:08:27.96 --> 01:08:28.96
Looks like we're all in.

849
01:08:28.96 --> 01:08:31.88
This is going to be a hell of a lot of fun.

850
01:08:31.88 --> 01:08:36.62
Switching to his left, the captain rolls back a black cloth covering a map of southeast

851
01:08:36.62 --> 01:08:37.62
Asia.

852
01:08:37.62 --> 01:08:42.72
Mac V saw is a top secret organization operating the width and breadth of the DMZ, west

853
01:08:42.72 --> 01:08:45.72
and the loss and south down through Cambodia.

854
01:08:45.72 --> 01:08:50.44
The shaded areas you see delineate the AO, air area of operations.

855
01:08:50.44 --> 01:08:53.40
You will enter the AO with no personal identification.

856
01:08:53.40 --> 01:08:55.88
Your weapons will not contain serial numbers.

857
01:08:55.88 --> 01:08:59.16
You and your gear will be what we call sterile.

858
01:08:59.16 --> 01:09:01.84
You will carry nothing that identifies you as an American.

859
01:09:01.84 --> 01:09:05.12
You will not carry pictures of your loved ones or anything else that doesn't directly

860
01:09:05.12 --> 01:09:06.64
pertain to your mission.

861
01:09:06.64 --> 01:09:11.08
Occasionally, you will use enemy weapons as well and dress like them.

862
01:09:11.08 --> 01:09:12.08
He pauses.

863
01:09:12.08 --> 01:09:13.96
Are there any questions?

864
01:09:13.96 --> 01:09:15.84
He picks up a glass of water.

865
01:09:15.84 --> 01:09:17.60
Are there any questions?

866
01:09:17.60 --> 01:09:19.60
The captain asks a second times.

867
01:09:19.60 --> 01:09:22.76
The second time, receiving no response other than stunned faces.

868
01:09:22.76 --> 01:09:24.40
He continues.

869
01:09:24.40 --> 01:09:26.28
Accepting this assignments.

870
01:09:26.28 --> 01:09:31.52
Accepting this assignment means you will be expected to run a minimum of three

871
01:09:31.52 --> 01:09:36.16
cross border missions to complete your tour of duty with Saga.

872
01:09:36.16 --> 01:09:40.32
After those missions, you can request a change of assignment to finish out your year in

873
01:09:40.32 --> 01:09:41.60
country.

874
01:09:41.60 --> 01:09:45.12
If you wish to leave Saga, we will honor that request.

875
01:09:45.12 --> 01:09:49.76
If you wish to leave special forces, we will send you to another unit or you can stand

876
01:09:49.76 --> 01:09:51.92
continue running missions.

877
01:09:51.92 --> 01:09:54.20
Now, are there any questions?

878
01:09:54.20 --> 01:09:56.32
Yes, sir.

879
01:09:56.32 --> 01:10:01.88
Are we spies asked one of our party without hesitation?

880
01:10:01.88 --> 01:10:07.12
By international law, yes, this is a covert operation as I said, top secret.

881
01:10:07.12 --> 01:10:14.80
Our job is to trail watch POW snatch wire tap ambush and just plain old enemy interdiction.

882
01:10:14.80 --> 01:10:17.80
You will be assigned to recon teams, RTs.

883
01:10:17.80 --> 01:10:22.20
Those teams are led by three Americans who are supported by nine mercenary commandos,

884
01:10:22.20 --> 01:10:25.12
which make up a full 12-man team.

885
01:10:25.12 --> 01:10:28.12
The American leader is designated a one zero.

886
01:10:28.12 --> 01:10:33.76
The assistant team leader is a one one and finally the radio operator has the designation

887
01:10:33.76 --> 01:10:35.44
of one two.

888
01:10:35.44 --> 01:10:39.48
The mercenaries are paid by us to work in the A.O. you see on this map.

889
01:10:39.48 --> 01:10:43.84
Additionally, there might be an arv in special forces team member who's job it is to

890
01:10:43.84 --> 01:10:49.000
handle the mercenary's well you do your intelligence work.

891
01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:50.88
E7.

892
01:10:50.88 --> 01:10:51.88
Next form, please.

893
01:10:51.88 --> 01:10:55.32
Please read this carefully before accepting a rejecting it.

894
01:10:55.32 --> 01:10:59.92
If you sign, you will become members of the most elite fighting force the United States

895
01:10:59.92 --> 01:11:03.16
has ever put in the field against an enemy.

896
01:11:03.16 --> 01:11:05.08
We are fighting a secret war.

897
01:11:05.08 --> 01:11:10.08
As I said earlier, you can never divulge your participation, recognize or give Koreans

898
01:11:10.08 --> 01:11:15.68
to any second or third party knowledge of our existence.

899
01:11:15.68 --> 01:11:20.04
The captain and E7 move into a shadowed corner quietly talking.

900
01:11:20.04 --> 01:11:25.52
I read carefully through the non-disclosure statements, threats of imprisonment, disgrace,

901
01:11:25.52 --> 01:11:28.36
loss of rights and freedoms.

902
01:11:28.36 --> 01:11:30.28
I sign.

903
01:11:30.28 --> 01:11:35.32
Talk about getting what you ask for.

904
01:11:35.32 --> 01:11:38.52
The E7 distributes another set of papers to each of us.

905
01:11:38.52 --> 01:11:42.68
Gentlemen, welcome to Mac Vesog, smiles the captain.

906
01:11:42.68 --> 01:11:46.24
We now need to address this last little consideration.

907
01:11:46.24 --> 01:11:51.60
If you're unlucky enough to be captured and wind up as a POW, we have a cover story along

908
01:11:51.60 --> 01:11:54.12
with an individual recognition procedure.

909
01:11:54.12 --> 01:11:57.52
Don't share what you are about to write with anyone.

910
01:11:57.52 --> 01:11:59.24
There are questions on this form.

911
01:11:59.24 --> 01:12:01.12
They are the same questions for each of you.

912
01:12:01.12 --> 01:12:05.80
However your response will be individual and will become the key to recognizing you and

913
01:12:05.80 --> 01:12:08.08
obtaining your release as a POW.

914
01:12:08.08 --> 01:12:11.48
Please fill in the answers, make them simple and conversational.

915
01:12:11.48 --> 01:12:15.04
Put the form into the attachment, no, a envelope and seal it.

916
01:12:15.04 --> 01:12:18.000
Then the envelope to me and no one else in this room.

917
01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.80
Do not look at each other's answers.

918
01:12:20.80 --> 01:12:25.12
Collecting the envelopes and stuffing them into a canvas at Tashay.

919
01:12:25.12 --> 01:12:29.36
The captain says, men, thank you for volunteering.

920
01:12:29.36 --> 01:12:31.96
Good luck and goodbye.

921
01:12:31.96 --> 01:12:40.32
Yeah, I forgot that part about the last second document.

922
01:12:40.32 --> 01:12:42.68
You put your individual information down.

923
01:12:42.68 --> 01:12:47.08
I forgot about that limb being sharper as he is.

924
01:12:47.08 --> 01:12:48.72
He must have taken notes.

925
01:12:48.72 --> 01:12:51.32
He's got some incredible information.

926
01:12:51.32 --> 01:12:53.80
Man, welcome to the secret war.

927
01:12:53.80 --> 01:12:55.20
Welcome to Saga.

928
01:12:55.20 --> 01:12:56.40
Yes, indeed.

929
01:12:56.40 --> 01:13:07.68
Did you, did you, when you were going through that moment, did you have any like hesitation?

930
01:13:07.68 --> 01:13:09.08
Oh, you just so all in.

931
01:13:09.08 --> 01:13:10.08
It was ridiculous.

932
01:13:10.08 --> 01:13:13.08
Yeah, absolutely.

933
01:13:13.08 --> 01:13:16.68
It's like Lin and my case, we have been going through all our training for all those

934
01:13:16.68 --> 01:13:17.68
months.

935
01:13:17.68 --> 01:13:23.16
It's like this is the war and the green beret movie had been out.

936
01:13:23.16 --> 01:13:25.60
What would they do?

937
01:13:25.60 --> 01:13:30.40
What's crazy is you are told, you were told don't volunteer for Saga.

938
01:13:30.40 --> 01:13:31.88
Oh, yeah, we went through training group.

939
01:13:31.88 --> 01:13:33.60
They're like, hey, listen.

940
01:13:33.60 --> 01:13:37.32
Don't volunteer for Saga, whatever you do, don't volunteer for Saga.

941
01:13:37.32 --> 01:13:41.20
Well, even there, it wasn't like direct, it would be like, you know, when you go get to

942
01:13:41.20 --> 01:13:46.16
an A camp, learn about the country to people and there's projects, don't volunteer,

943
01:13:46.16 --> 01:13:48.20
because of the people are dying.

944
01:13:48.20 --> 01:13:49.20
This is 68.

945
01:13:49.20 --> 01:13:52.28
We had so many teams who've been wiped out by that point.

946
01:13:52.28 --> 01:13:56.72
The briefer didn't tell Lin anything about that.

947
01:13:56.72 --> 01:13:58.72
The Cassie race by that point.

948
01:13:58.72 --> 01:14:00.72
Oh, yeah.

949
01:14:00.72 --> 01:14:12.000
Gearing up each individual aware or carry sterile fatigues or tiger suit, flop brim hat with

950
01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:16.000
a portion of panel sewn inside the top.

951
01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:22.64
Jungle boots, pistol belt harness, first aid packet, pill kit, heavy and sharp canteens

952
01:14:22.64 --> 01:14:27.72
with waterproof purification tablets, smoke grenades, compass survival kit, individual

953
01:14:27.72 --> 01:14:33.80
pistol, submachine gun and sought off M79 weapon signal mirror panel, strobe light, pan

954
01:14:33.80 --> 01:14:39.40
flare with flares, ammo pouches, rucksack with reinforced straps, rations, weapons cleaning

955
01:14:39.40 --> 01:14:46.08
kit, maps, poncho and liner, can opener, p38 or knife with can opener, waterproof matches,

956
01:14:46.08 --> 01:14:51.96
insect and leach repellent jungle sweater, RT10 survival radio, pen light, six foot of nylon

957
01:14:51.96 --> 01:14:57.72
cord, parachute suspension cord, Swiss seat, two snap links, notebook and pencil, two plastic

958
01:14:57.72 --> 01:15:03.64
bags, fragmentation white phosphorus and gas grenades, two crevat bandages, gloves, claymore,

959
01:15:03.64 --> 01:15:15.36
serum, the team will need to carry a camera and film binoculars, ANPRC 25 radio, or as

960
01:15:15.36 --> 01:15:22.08
you call it a prick 25 with extra battery M14 toe popper mines and booby traps, anti-intrus

961
01:15:22.08 --> 01:15:26.76
and device wire taps and equipment for prisoner snatches.

962
01:15:26.76 --> 01:15:29.56
That's all.

963
01:15:29.56 --> 01:15:32.08
What exactly is a wire tap?

964
01:15:32.08 --> 01:15:34.84
It's like go ahead, tilt.

965
01:15:34.84 --> 01:15:36.44
You have the telephone lines.

966
01:15:36.44 --> 01:15:37.44
Right.

967
01:15:37.44 --> 01:15:39.76
So that's the wire and you tap into it.

968
01:15:39.76 --> 01:15:44.22
And then in our case, you go to the telephone pole, put the wires, our wires, onto the

969
01:15:44.22 --> 01:15:49.78
wire, tape it, then condone a pole cover with mud so that nobody would see it and we

970
01:15:49.78 --> 01:15:51.54
have it tied into it.

971
01:15:51.54 --> 01:15:56.30
At that time, state of your cassette.

972
01:15:56.30 --> 01:16:01.94
We record even if there was nobody talking to the CIA, how does do the actual recordings

973
01:16:01.94 --> 01:16:06.54
so that they could hear it and they would amplify the tapes.

974
01:16:06.54 --> 01:16:08.02
They said they amplify it a hundred times.

975
01:16:08.02 --> 01:16:12.30
They could hear things on the background because the NVA phones were near in the cradle,

976
01:16:12.30 --> 01:16:15.82
their lives, like our phones, they shut off.

977
01:16:15.82 --> 01:16:19.86
Those were still alive to CIA, we give them all our tapes and they would amplify it.

978
01:16:19.86 --> 01:16:21.86
They said they got into all of those things.

979
01:16:21.86 --> 01:16:25.50
So they hear people talking in the background about stuff.

980
01:16:25.50 --> 01:16:30.18
And of course, CIA, we give, they take and they're done.

981
01:16:30.18 --> 01:16:32.14
You never hear anything back at all.

982
01:16:32.14 --> 01:16:36.18
So when you say your wire taps are part of the list of stuff, they guys have one, do

983
01:16:36.18 --> 01:16:38.18
it like a little apparatus or something like that.

984
01:16:38.18 --> 01:16:42.06
Because the actual cassette recorder, then the wire and then at the end of wire to be

985
01:16:42.06 --> 01:16:47.42
two little things that you tape onto it or go through.

986
01:16:47.42 --> 01:16:49.82
Sometimes the wire would have a double area.

987
01:16:49.82 --> 01:16:51.46
Yeah, plug it in between.

988
01:16:51.46 --> 01:16:53.74
Then you tape it.

989
01:16:53.74 --> 01:16:56.06
How big was the cassette recorder?

990
01:16:56.06 --> 01:16:57.06
Shoe box?

991
01:16:57.06 --> 01:16:59.42
I'm picture and shoe box.

992
01:16:59.42 --> 01:17:00.42
Was this big?

993
01:17:00.42 --> 01:17:01.42
Is this shoe box?

994
01:17:01.42 --> 01:17:02.42
No, no, no.

995
01:17:02.42 --> 01:17:03.42
I'm just making it.

996
01:17:03.42 --> 01:17:04.42
I'm like a walk-man.

997
01:17:04.42 --> 01:17:05.42
Like a book.

998
01:17:05.42 --> 01:17:06.42
Like a book.

999
01:17:06.42 --> 01:17:07.42
Like a cell book.

1000
01:17:07.42 --> 01:17:08.42
Like the old school.

1001
01:17:08.42 --> 01:17:09.42
Very old.

1002
01:17:09.42 --> 01:17:10.42
Like the handle.

1003
01:17:10.42 --> 01:17:13.42
Was it a tape cassette in there?

1004
01:17:13.42 --> 01:17:15.42
Or was it like some kind of reel to reel?

1005
01:17:15.42 --> 01:17:16.42
No, no.

1006
01:17:16.42 --> 01:17:17.42
No kidding.

1007
01:17:17.42 --> 01:17:18.42
You guys were high speed.

1008
01:17:18.42 --> 01:17:19.42
All tires.

1009
01:17:19.42 --> 01:17:20.42
It's a stadium.

1010
01:17:20.42 --> 01:17:21.42
This is a 1960.

1011
01:17:21.42 --> 01:17:24.82
None of the reel to reel stuff in the field.

1012
01:17:24.82 --> 01:17:27.34
And the cassette, I think we had it by then.

1013
01:17:27.34 --> 01:17:32.30
They had the two hour cassette so you could do an hour on each one side.

1014
01:17:32.30 --> 01:17:35.06
As opposed to a 60 with 30 on each side.

1015
01:17:35.06 --> 01:17:39.32
Someone's sitting down there, freaking flipping those damn cassettes over, while you're

1016
01:17:39.32 --> 01:17:41.38
out in Laos and Cambodia.

1017
01:17:41.38 --> 01:17:44.06
Hey, keep she's something to divert your attention.

1018
01:17:44.06 --> 01:17:45.06
Watching the trail.

1019
01:17:45.06 --> 01:17:46.06
Yeah.

1020
01:17:46.06 --> 01:17:49.78
Swat and the skis.

1021
01:17:49.78 --> 01:17:53.58
So I mentioned that the way he sets this book up is you're reading and it makes it

1022
01:17:53.58 --> 01:17:55.70
very conversational in a way.

1023
01:17:55.70 --> 01:17:58.18
But he sets a lot of it up as debriefing.

1024
01:17:58.18 --> 01:17:59.18
Yeah.

1025
01:17:59.18 --> 01:18:00.66
And he also wrote this.

1026
01:18:00.66 --> 01:18:02.02
And this is one of his thoughts.

1027
01:18:02.02 --> 01:18:05.02
Have you ever seen yourself through the eyes or someone you've become?

1028
01:18:05.02 --> 01:18:08.82
No, this isn't an existential question.

1029
01:18:08.82 --> 01:18:09.98
Really have you.

1030
01:18:09.98 --> 01:18:17.98
And what that made me think about is when you're debriefing, you're kind of forcing yourself

1031
01:18:17.98 --> 01:18:20.50
to detach and explain what you did.

1032
01:18:20.50 --> 01:18:28.46
And it's almost like you're seeing yourself in a third person situation.

1033
01:18:28.46 --> 01:18:31.94
So in this particular cassette to set this up, they're in there.

1034
01:18:31.94 --> 01:18:35.78
And this isn't, we talked a little bit about you guys playing Liars Dice and sitting

1035
01:18:35.78 --> 01:18:39.42
around the bar and having some drinks and debriefing amongst yourselves.

1036
01:18:39.42 --> 01:18:40.42
Right.

1037
01:18:40.42 --> 01:18:43.38
Well, this one is set up not like that.

1038
01:18:43.38 --> 01:18:45.10
This is an official debriefing.

1039
01:18:45.10 --> 01:18:46.10
Oh, yeah.

1040
01:18:46.10 --> 01:18:48.10
And did you guys always do official debriefing?

1041
01:18:48.10 --> 01:18:49.38
Because it doesn't sound like it.

1042
01:18:49.38 --> 01:18:55.50
It sounds like this was an operation that was so significant that it required a like an

1043
01:18:55.50 --> 01:18:57.38
on-site special debriefing.

1044
01:18:57.38 --> 01:18:58.38
Oh, yeah.

1045
01:18:58.38 --> 01:18:59.58
We wouldn't write to S2.

1046
01:18:59.58 --> 01:19:00.58
Okay.

1047
01:19:00.58 --> 01:19:01.58
So you guys always did this.

1048
01:19:01.58 --> 01:19:03.58
They are, that's an S2P.

1049
01:19:03.58 --> 01:19:04.58
Got it.

1050
01:19:04.58 --> 01:19:05.58
Absolutely.

1051
01:19:05.58 --> 01:19:06.58
And there's really hot.

1052
01:19:06.58 --> 01:19:12.86
They would get the initial word down by radio transmission on RTT and then come back

1053
01:19:12.86 --> 01:19:14.70
with a four at their action report.

1054
01:19:14.70 --> 01:19:15.70
Yeah.

1055
01:19:15.70 --> 01:19:22.14
It sounds like this one is pretty significant.

1056
01:19:22.14 --> 01:19:26.70
So, and I'm going to fast forward just a little bit.

1057
01:19:26.70 --> 01:19:28.30
And here we go.

1058
01:19:28.30 --> 01:19:32.42
Socialist black, please begin, which again, this is crazy.

1059
01:19:32.42 --> 01:19:33.42
Isn't E4.

1060
01:19:33.42 --> 01:19:34.42
Yeah.

1061
01:19:34.42 --> 01:19:36.42
Pretty crazy.

1062
01:19:36.42 --> 01:19:40.62
Specialist black, please begin.

1063
01:19:40.62 --> 01:19:43.94
Apprehensively, I mentally move back in time.

1064
01:19:43.94 --> 01:19:48.82
The monthly side-gone target list arrived and as usual, the team leaders gathered in the

1065
01:19:48.82 --> 01:19:53.18
Taxal Operations Center to pick or be assigned their missions.

1066
01:19:53.18 --> 01:19:56.62
Some have to be assigned because no one wants to run those targets.

1067
01:19:56.62 --> 01:19:57.62
Why is that?

1068
01:19:57.62 --> 01:20:01.06
They're known to be one way trips.

1069
01:20:01.06 --> 01:20:04.06
I see response the sergeant.

1070
01:20:04.06 --> 01:20:08.86
Oscar eight, which is known to be one of those one way trips, is always assigned on a

1071
01:20:08.86 --> 01:20:10.50
lottery system.

1072
01:20:10.50 --> 01:20:16.82
My understanding is that the last 12 teams attempting to run that mission have never been

1073
01:20:16.82 --> 01:20:19.46
heard from again.

1074
01:20:19.46 --> 01:20:25.86
Or were so shot up that they've been disbanded.

1075
01:20:25.86 --> 01:20:30.10
So this one particular mission set was called Oscar eight.

1076
01:20:30.10 --> 01:20:34.74
And this Oscar eight, there's been 12 teams that have gone to execute this operation.

1077
01:20:34.74 --> 01:20:40.42
And maybe even totally disappeared or they've been so messed up that they disbanded the

1078
01:20:40.42 --> 01:20:41.42
teams.

1079
01:20:41.42 --> 01:20:44.62
Yeah, it's just the nasty targets where the major roads came together.

1080
01:20:44.62 --> 01:20:46.10
I forget these act highways.

1081
01:20:46.10 --> 01:20:48.46
Like 92, there's a couple other.

1082
01:20:48.46 --> 01:20:51.38
It all came in to Northern part of South Vietnam.

1083
01:20:51.38 --> 01:20:54.38
And we later learned that they had a major headquarters area there.

1084
01:20:54.38 --> 01:20:57.14
That's what like on the ground.

1085
01:20:57.14 --> 01:21:00.98
The first book with Pat, with first chapter of Pat Walkins, they were in Oscar eight.

1086
01:21:00.98 --> 01:21:04.22
And when the NBA came up, it says, you're turning for guard duty.

1087
01:21:04.22 --> 01:21:09.90
That's what Lin's talking about.

1088
01:21:09.90 --> 01:21:15.22
He says one of them, one of them, one of the analysts, specialist block, we're interested

1089
01:21:15.22 --> 01:21:17.94
in the intel gathered during the VR.

1090
01:21:17.94 --> 01:21:20.22
We know the history of the target.

1091
01:21:20.22 --> 01:21:21.82
Chives the lieutenant out, analyst.

1092
01:21:21.82 --> 01:21:24.30
So the guy's basically going, look, we know it's a bad target.

1093
01:21:24.30 --> 01:21:28.14
You want to know about your visual reconnaissance.

1094
01:21:28.14 --> 01:21:31.54
Sir, that's, and he's showing a lot of restraint right now.

1095
01:21:31.54 --> 01:21:34.14
Sir, that's precisely the point I'm getting at.

1096
01:21:34.14 --> 01:21:38.62
Please bear with me as I step through this process so I don't forget any of the details.

1097
01:21:38.62 --> 01:21:39.94
Keep calm man.

1098
01:21:39.94 --> 01:21:43.30
He does now have a clue of the edge I'm takering on, calm down.

1099
01:21:43.30 --> 01:21:48.14
Got to get calm down, how long to take to get over the after mission jitters.

1100
01:21:48.14 --> 01:21:52.06
Be quick about it, specialist replies the lieutenant impatiently.

1101
01:21:52.06 --> 01:21:55.78
Oh, yeah, I'll rev that that.

1102
01:21:55.78 --> 01:22:04.50
Yes, sir, Alabama won the lottery.

1103
01:22:04.50 --> 01:22:08.46
R-1-1, I point to Angelkey.

1104
01:22:08.46 --> 01:22:09.46
Angelkey.

1105
01:22:09.46 --> 01:22:10.46
Angelkey.

1106
01:22:10.46 --> 01:22:13.46
I put it to Angelkey.

1107
01:22:13.46 --> 01:22:17.98
Volunteered to lead us through a map study, picking primary, secondary, and alternate

1108
01:22:17.98 --> 01:22:20.98
landing zones, landing and extraction zones.

1109
01:22:20.98 --> 01:22:25.94
We studied every bit of intelligence we could layer hands on about the weather patterns in the

1110
01:22:25.94 --> 01:22:30.50
AO area of operation, the known enemy, and how they maneuver.

1111
01:22:30.50 --> 01:22:34.50
Sometimes you can pick up more information in the club than in the reports, not in this

1112
01:22:34.50 --> 01:22:36.06
case.

1113
01:22:36.06 --> 01:22:39.70
There are no surviving old hands to talk about the lottery.

1114
01:22:39.70 --> 01:22:42.46
There was no intel in the target folder.

1115
01:22:42.46 --> 01:22:44.10
That's the point, sir.

1116
01:22:44.10 --> 01:22:51.22
They're going in blind, no turnover.

1117
01:22:51.22 --> 01:22:54.10
And then he fast forward a little bit.

1118
01:22:54.10 --> 01:22:58.78
The analyst says you were provided no target intelligence.

1119
01:22:58.78 --> 01:23:04.34
We were told none was available armed with maps and a camera bulldog scheduled a VR two

1120
01:23:04.34 --> 01:23:07.94
days before mission launch offers one one.

1121
01:23:07.94 --> 01:23:09.94
Bulldog whose code name is that?

1122
01:23:09.94 --> 01:23:14.98
He was the code name of Sergeant Stride, the Alabama team leader, R10.

1123
01:23:14.98 --> 01:23:20.42
As you know, he was greased, killed in action.

1124
01:23:20.42 --> 01:23:24.86
Like one one said, the same person sitting next to you, the same one one, are you referring

1125
01:23:24.86 --> 01:23:27.34
to specialist Angelkey?

1126
01:23:27.34 --> 01:23:28.34
Yes, sir.

1127
01:23:28.34 --> 01:23:32.86
Recon, team, Alabama's one one, the assistant team leader.

1128
01:23:32.86 --> 01:23:34.34
Like he said, he was sick.

1129
01:23:34.34 --> 01:23:36.46
So I ran the VR with Bulldog.

1130
01:23:36.46 --> 01:23:39.38
We needed the intel to be as fresh as possible for the mission.

1131
01:23:39.38 --> 01:23:42.14
It takes one day to develop film and study the pictures.

1132
01:23:42.14 --> 01:23:46.86
So it was never, it was then or never if we were going to launch on October 5th.

1133
01:23:46.86 --> 01:23:48.62
One one wasn't feeling well.

1134
01:23:48.62 --> 01:23:50.38
That made me the photographer.

1135
01:23:50.38 --> 01:23:55.50
Bulldog and I squeezed side by side into the narrow rear seat of a Vietnamese Air Force

1136
01:23:55.50 --> 01:23:56.50
U17.

1137
01:23:56.50 --> 01:23:57.94
The weather was clear.

1138
01:23:57.94 --> 01:24:02.10
We took off from food by airfield circling out over the China Sea.

1139
01:24:02.10 --> 01:24:07.26
We came in high, taking pictures of the entire A.O. yelling at each other over the engine

1140
01:24:07.26 --> 01:24:09.30
noise in order to discuss what we could see.

1141
01:24:09.30 --> 01:24:13.94
And attempting to orient what we saw to the maps with those windows.

1142
01:24:13.94 --> 01:24:18.62
And this is a thought with those windows open and the maps were blowing all over the dam

1143
01:24:18.62 --> 01:24:20.90
place until Bulldog got them under control.

1144
01:24:20.90 --> 01:24:26.58
We flew under clouds and over rivers of mist filled ridges, platoes and valleys picking

1145
01:24:26.58 --> 01:24:31.54
a primary and two alternate LZs.

1146
01:24:31.54 --> 01:24:35.82
Bulldog ordered the pilot to make a photo pass over the primary LZ at 100 feet.

1147
01:24:35.82 --> 01:24:40.18
The pilot objected and told us he wanted to stay high and leave the area soon.

1148
01:24:40.18 --> 01:24:43.74
Good thinking replies the sergeant.

1149
01:24:43.74 --> 01:24:46.14
Bulldog slapped the pilot on the back of his head.

1150
01:24:46.14 --> 01:24:47.14
So this is him.

1151
01:24:47.14 --> 01:24:52.36
I'm not doing this very well, but this is this is Lynn Black kind of explaining, hey,

1152
01:24:52.36 --> 01:24:57.18
Bulldog ordered the pilots make another two to make another pass and the pilot said, no,

1153
01:24:57.18 --> 01:24:58.34
I'm not going to do it.

1154
01:24:58.34 --> 01:25:00.38
And then the sergeant says, good thinking.

1155
01:25:00.38 --> 01:25:04.86
And he says, well, Bulldog slapped the pilot on the back of his helmet, barking the order again.

1156
01:25:04.86 --> 01:25:10.50
We dropped down to a tree top level and I managed one picture before the nose the ship

1157
01:25:10.50 --> 01:25:13.26
rose and we began banking for another pass.

1158
01:25:13.26 --> 01:25:18.18
As we climbed, our plane was stitched with machine gun fire rounds rip through the floor,

1159
01:25:18.18 --> 01:25:19.38
extended the ceiling.

1160
01:25:19.38 --> 01:25:22.66
The cabin was sprayed and flexed with blood as the copilot was struck under the

1161
01:25:22.66 --> 01:25:27.02
chin as helmet slammed against the ceiling, ricocheting into my lap.

1162
01:25:27.02 --> 01:25:29.02
Still containing part of his head.

1163
01:25:29.02 --> 01:25:37.46
That picture will be imprinted in my mind forever forever.

1164
01:25:37.46 --> 01:25:40.18
And he says he thinks it's a pain.

1165
01:25:40.18 --> 01:25:43.78
I guess I'm sad sadness that grips the soul of my very being.

1166
01:25:43.78 --> 01:25:48.14
I like that cold pilot before we took off from food by he was trying to tell me a joke

1167
01:25:48.14 --> 01:25:49.62
in really bad English.

1168
01:25:49.62 --> 01:25:53.58
I didn't get it, but laughed anyways.

1169
01:25:53.58 --> 01:25:58.26
You're okay, specialist block.

1170
01:25:58.26 --> 01:26:03.50
Sorry, you okay, specialist, black asked chief saw glancing at his medical team.

1171
01:26:03.50 --> 01:26:08.50
Yes, sir, I was telling you about the incident, the image of the helmet and partial head

1172
01:26:08.50 --> 01:26:10.70
popped into my mind.

1173
01:26:10.70 --> 01:26:13.82
I'd never seen anything like that before.

1174
01:26:13.82 --> 01:26:17.54
I was fighting a thousand emotions all at once, all flooding through me, forcing my eyes

1175
01:26:17.54 --> 01:26:21.58
to glist in those kind of images have a way of staying with us for the reminder of our

1176
01:26:21.58 --> 01:26:22.58
lives.

1177
01:26:22.58 --> 01:26:26.58
Each of us has to find a way to deal with them in order to go on.

1178
01:26:26.58 --> 01:26:30.34
I can't even ignore your story orders the chief, yes, sir.

1179
01:26:30.34 --> 01:26:32.34
I collect my thoughts.

1180
01:26:32.34 --> 01:26:35.70
The pilot dropped the sess nut back down to tree top level.

1181
01:26:35.70 --> 01:26:40.34
We got the hell out of dodge in the wild west.

1182
01:26:40.34 --> 01:26:43.86
Yeah, you mentioned the ramps.

1183
01:26:43.86 --> 01:26:47.14
You said that this lieutenant analyst is a ramp for those people that don't know ramp

1184
01:26:47.14 --> 01:26:51.06
his stance for rear echelon mother fucker.

1185
01:26:51.06 --> 01:26:55.66
That's the person that's these are the people that are not on the front lines, not

1186
01:26:55.66 --> 01:26:56.66
doing the fight in ants.

1187
01:26:56.66 --> 01:27:01.94
Actually, the genesis of the name of my consulting company, echelon front, which is not

1188
01:27:01.94 --> 01:27:02.94
rear echelon.

1189
01:27:02.94 --> 01:27:07.34
Hey, I'm in the rear with a gear, but hey, front line leadership.

1190
01:27:07.34 --> 01:27:15.34
This whole scene, for whatever Hollywood director is listening to this right now or whatever

1191
01:27:15.34 --> 01:27:18.70
producer, who makes movies, echo-trolls?

1192
01:27:18.70 --> 01:27:21.98
Who ever is going to make this into a movie?

1193
01:27:21.98 --> 01:27:25.62
This is the iconic scene.

1194
01:27:25.62 --> 01:27:31.50
Of the rear echelon mother fuckers trying to debrief this guy and we're going to get

1195
01:27:31.50 --> 01:27:32.50
into the mission.

1196
01:27:32.50 --> 01:27:37.38
And once you realize what he just went through, you can see why this is such an intense

1197
01:27:37.38 --> 01:27:38.78
scene.

1198
01:27:38.78 --> 01:27:42.62
Because he's sitting there just having barely survived.

1199
01:27:42.62 --> 01:27:47.90
Lost guys and they're asking him these questions and it's just your classic iconic

1200
01:27:47.90 --> 01:27:53.28
scene of a disconnect between the people in the front lines and the rear echelon mother

1201
01:27:53.28 --> 01:27:54.28
fuckers.

1202
01:27:54.28 --> 01:27:59.56
And I talked to her third, two days, he fully actual mission doing a VR.

1203
01:27:59.56 --> 01:28:00.56
Oh, yeah, that's right.

1204
01:28:00.56 --> 01:28:04.92
So, the debrief is after the mission, but the part that he's talking about, they haven't

1205
01:28:04.92 --> 01:28:06.92
even done the mission yet.

1206
01:28:06.92 --> 01:28:09.64
This is they're getting shot at as they're doing a visual reconnaissance.

1207
01:28:09.64 --> 01:28:13.32
They lose a pilot while they're doing the visual reconnaissance.

1208
01:28:13.32 --> 01:28:18.76
Can you imagine this is why this is till, if you did this VR and you came back to me

1209
01:28:18.76 --> 01:28:20.76
and said, hey, Jocca, we did the visual reconnaissance.

1210
01:28:20.76 --> 01:28:24.12
Either way, we had a pilot shot, the plane got shot up.

1211
01:28:24.12 --> 01:28:25.12
I've got to use Helmys.

1212
01:28:25.12 --> 01:28:26.12
You want to use it?

1213
01:28:26.12 --> 01:28:27.96
Yeah, I'd say, hey, guess what?

1214
01:28:27.96 --> 01:28:29.60
We're not going into there.

1215
01:28:29.60 --> 01:28:32.000
I'd say, it's not happening.

1216
01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:35.52
Okay, it's not, we're not, it's a no-go.

1217
01:28:35.52 --> 01:28:36.52
Yeah.

1218
01:28:36.52 --> 01:28:41.76
You guys had freaking balls.

1219
01:28:41.76 --> 01:28:42.92
We didn't have you.

1220
01:28:42.92 --> 01:28:44.12
Yeah.

1221
01:28:44.12 --> 01:28:47.76
Crazy.

1222
01:28:47.76 --> 01:28:51.92
The insertion, Kavie, was Captain Greg Hartniss.

1223
01:28:51.92 --> 01:28:53.96
Kavie 265 was his call sign.

1224
01:28:53.96 --> 01:29:00.12
His rider was Sergeant 1st Class Patrick Watkins, code name, Mandolin.

1225
01:29:00.12 --> 01:29:05.76
The second Kavie pilot was Colonel Don Born Castle and his rider was Staff Sergeant Bob

1226
01:29:05.76 --> 01:29:09.28
Park's, his code name is Spiderman.

1227
01:29:09.28 --> 01:29:14.30
Lieutenant George Miller, Scarface 56, was the lead gunship pilot who escorted the

1228
01:29:14.30 --> 01:29:15.84
King Beast into the insertion.

1229
01:29:15.84 --> 01:29:18.96
So now we're actually getting into the operation.

1230
01:29:18.96 --> 01:29:26.28
And they do, you know, I'm skipping forward, you know, and look, as I said before, to

1231
01:29:26.28 --> 01:29:28.92
get the rest of the details just by the book and read it.

1232
01:29:28.92 --> 01:29:29.96
And it's incredible.

1233
01:29:29.96 --> 01:29:35.12
The details that he captures are awesome.

1234
01:29:35.12 --> 01:29:38.72
So, but I'm going to fast forward a little bit.

1235
01:29:38.72 --> 01:29:48.40
So the, he covers the insertions and then the lieutenant says that the analyst lieutenant

1236
01:29:48.40 --> 01:29:52.32
says, we expect you to take as long as you need on this portion of the debrief.

1237
01:29:52.32 --> 01:29:55.76
When you're finished, I'm sure you're one one will fill in the missing details.

1238
01:29:55.76 --> 01:29:59.60
Gather your thoughts and begin when ready.

1239
01:29:59.60 --> 01:30:01.16
One one fill in the details.

1240
01:30:01.16 --> 01:30:02.76
Never mind that.

1241
01:30:02.76 --> 01:30:07.000
Back across the fence, we're moving through dense foliage, a ridge rising to a right.

1242
01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:11.000
Okay, here goes.

1243
01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:18.04
RT Alabama was ambushed approximately 0,800 hours on October 5, 1968.

1244
01:30:18.04 --> 01:30:23.16
At coordinates Yankee Charlie 561, 6, 9 or 2.

1245
01:30:23.16 --> 01:30:29.08
Our point man, Howa was hit multiple times in his chest and lower body in that same

1246
01:30:29.08 --> 01:30:33.96
instant, three rounds penetrated our 10 team leaders head.

1247
01:30:33.96 --> 01:30:40.28
Cowboy, the interpreter was behind stride and took an RPD round below his left shoulder.

1248
01:30:40.28 --> 01:30:43.60
I was behind Cowboy when he went down.

1249
01:30:43.60 --> 01:30:48.20
The assistant team leader, the one one went down at the same time.

1250
01:30:48.20 --> 01:30:51.32
I thought he was hit as well.

1251
01:30:51.32 --> 01:30:52.32
Are you hit?

1252
01:30:52.32 --> 01:30:54.96
I yell at the one one, receiving no response.

1253
01:30:54.96 --> 01:30:57.60
Damn, he's dead too.

1254
01:30:57.60 --> 01:30:59.88
Only six of us left standing.

1255
01:30:59.88 --> 01:31:02.56
Bring out the bodies.

1256
01:31:02.56 --> 01:31:04.56
Engage the enemy.

1257
01:31:04.56 --> 01:31:11.16
Lock Howa, the zero one Vietnamese team leader, orders the recon team Alabama to fire

1258
01:31:11.16 --> 01:31:14.92
a full magazine just off the ground level to suppress enemy fire.

1259
01:31:14.92 --> 01:31:20.20
At our right on a slight rise, there's a line of NVA firing down into our position.

1260
01:31:20.20 --> 01:31:23.76
There are above us to the right over there, a yell over the den of the ambush, thumbing

1261
01:31:23.76 --> 01:31:28.60
the selector of my car 15 to single shot, I began picking them off one at a time.

1262
01:31:28.60 --> 01:31:33.000
Many rounds expanded, I pushed the magazine extraction button on the receiver, shredding vegetation

1263
01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:38.32
royals in the air punctuated by green and V8 tracers, searching out their targets.

1264
01:31:38.32 --> 01:31:42.40
Fumbling for another magazine in a canteen pouch on my web gear, I peer through the raging

1265
01:31:42.40 --> 01:31:45.68
floor a storm in the direction of the tracer source.

1266
01:31:45.68 --> 01:31:49.56
An NVA shot a moment ago is getting up and pointing in my direction.

1267
01:31:49.56 --> 01:31:54.36
OK, second magazine snaps into place, slapping the left side of the receiver, the car

1268
01:31:54.36 --> 01:32:00.36
15 bolt slams home as I raise the weapon firing twice, stay down, dammit.

1269
01:32:00.36 --> 01:32:04.80
We've got to break contact, I yell at the team, continuing down the line, emptying magazine

1270
01:32:04.80 --> 01:32:08.92
to the NVA fall, like targets in a shooting gallery.

1271
01:32:08.92 --> 01:32:12.92
Another line moves in behind them, taking their place, wearing a low spot.

1272
01:32:12.92 --> 01:32:15.36
We have to get out of this hole, I yell.

1273
01:32:15.36 --> 01:32:19.76
Cowboy interprets to the team, whose cowboy is he an American interpreter, queries the

1274
01:32:19.76 --> 01:32:24.64
puzzle lieutenant analyst as he searches through his notes, huh?

1275
01:32:24.64 --> 01:32:25.64
What did you ask sir?

1276
01:32:25.64 --> 01:32:27.40
Cowboy, whose cowboy?

1277
01:32:27.40 --> 01:32:34.52
Cowboys are Vietnamese interpreter, uh, Don Van Con, one one inserts quick, quickly,

1278
01:32:34.52 --> 01:32:38.000
continue ordered orders lieutenant.

1279
01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:42.80
Crouching, I reload, surveying our situation, then grab the radio handset off my web

1280
01:32:42.80 --> 01:32:43.80
harness.

1281
01:32:43.80 --> 01:32:50.80
We have three killed and two wounded over, whose down, cuvie rider Patrick Watkins,

1282
01:32:50.80 --> 01:32:57.12
calmly demands, point bulldog and one one over, blackjack, you're not a doctor, nor for

1283
01:32:57.12 --> 01:32:58.12
that fact, a medic.

1284
01:32:58.12 --> 01:33:00.04
You can't determine who's dead or alive.

1285
01:33:00.04 --> 01:33:04.92
You must attempt to bring out all the bodies for verification of death, a fresh swarm of

1286
01:33:04.92 --> 01:33:11.32
automatic weapon fire, up another foliage hurricane, drowning out cuvie communication, finally

1287
01:33:11.32 --> 01:33:12.72
it settles down.

1288
01:33:12.72 --> 01:33:16.80
Bullin, blackjack, we're taking heavy automatic fire.

1289
01:33:16.80 --> 01:33:19.04
We'll be lucky to get the living out.

1290
01:33:19.04 --> 01:33:23.64
They have us surrounded on three sides and are firing down into our position, I'm moving

1291
01:33:23.64 --> 01:33:26.60
the team out of this hole over.

1292
01:33:26.60 --> 01:33:29.68
Chuhoy translated means surrender.

1293
01:33:29.68 --> 01:33:32.32
Yels, one of the NVA in a short, low of the ambush.

1294
01:33:32.32 --> 01:33:33.32
I don't think so.

1295
01:33:33.32 --> 01:33:36.16
I yell back, firing in his general direction.

1296
01:33:36.16 --> 01:33:40.48
Alabama's weapons on full auto drown out further.

1297
01:33:40.48 --> 01:33:42.60
Chuhoy requests.

1298
01:33:42.60 --> 01:33:46.28
One one is alive and praying.

1299
01:33:46.28 --> 01:33:50.84
In the middle of a gunfight, this is no time to pray.

1300
01:33:50.84 --> 01:33:52.76
Get up off your sarias and return fire.

1301
01:33:52.76 --> 01:33:53.76
I yell.

1302
01:33:53.76 --> 01:33:58.32
One one looks at me with dough eyes shifting his body and attempt to make him make his

1303
01:33:58.32 --> 01:33:59.32
form smaller.

1304
01:33:59.32 --> 01:34:04.08
I kneeled down next to him and find he has a Catholic rosary press to his lips and is quietly

1305
01:34:04.08 --> 01:34:05.32
chanting a prayer.

1306
01:34:05.32 --> 01:34:09.84
I need you to take contact with command while I do my job directing air strikes and get us

1307
01:34:09.84 --> 01:34:11.64
a ride home.

1308
01:34:11.64 --> 01:34:13.28
I don't know what to do.

1309
01:34:13.28 --> 01:34:14.44
I can't think.

1310
01:34:14.44 --> 01:34:19.08
I can't angle key slips into himself.

1311
01:34:19.08 --> 01:34:22.52
Well whiskey, tango, fox, trot over.

1312
01:34:22.52 --> 01:34:27.96
Leaves and twigs rain down on Alabama as the ground erupts around us from automatic

1313
01:34:27.96 --> 01:34:30.08
weapons fire.

1314
01:34:30.08 --> 01:34:31.96
So his one one is locked up mentally.

1315
01:34:31.96 --> 01:34:33.88
Yes, point gone.

1316
01:34:33.88 --> 01:34:35.80
Body there but no mind no courage.

1317
01:34:35.80 --> 01:34:38.28
And he actually thought he was dead.

1318
01:34:38.28 --> 01:34:43.68
And everyone got shot in that opening ambush, Lynn, which by the way, his nickname, his

1319
01:34:43.68 --> 01:34:44.68
code name is Blackjack.

1320
01:34:44.68 --> 01:34:46.40
So that's who it is.

1321
01:34:46.40 --> 01:34:51.48
Blackjack thinks he's dead but then he finally gets to him and looks at him and he's

1322
01:34:51.48 --> 01:34:56.16
not even shot but he's having, he's having a meltdown.

1323
01:34:56.16 --> 01:35:02.32
He's on his rosaries.

1324
01:35:02.32 --> 01:35:03.84
Back on the radio, mandolin.

1325
01:35:03.84 --> 01:35:07.08
So mandolin is the call sign of the cuvie.

1326
01:35:07.08 --> 01:35:08.48
Mandolin, Blackjack, you're right.

1327
01:35:08.48 --> 01:35:09.64
We don't have three dead.

1328
01:35:09.64 --> 01:35:11.44
We only have two.

1329
01:35:11.44 --> 01:35:12.44
One one is alive.

1330
01:35:12.44 --> 01:35:15.36
The NVR now on all sides with snipers climbing into trees.

1331
01:35:15.36 --> 01:35:18.96
I have to take action quickly or die.

1332
01:35:18.96 --> 01:35:22.08
Blackjack put your one one on the horn over.

1333
01:35:22.08 --> 01:35:27.44
So here's the cuvie rider saying, hey, put your put the guy in charge on the radio.

1334
01:35:27.44 --> 01:35:31.60
I attempt to push the radio handset into one one's hands but he wraps both hands around

1335
01:35:31.60 --> 01:35:34.12
his rosary chanting.

1336
01:35:34.12 --> 01:35:39.000
He drops his head drawing his form further inward.

1337
01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:45.000
Cowboy, tell the team, I'm the one zero and locks and locks in charge of B team.

1338
01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.36
As if I had to tell them, loaks already doing the job.

1339
01:35:47.36 --> 01:35:48.80
Mandolin, Blackjack.

1340
01:35:48.80 --> 01:35:51.08
One one is unable to talk right at the moment.

1341
01:35:51.08 --> 01:35:54.52
I'm the one zero of Alabama stand by.

1342
01:35:54.52 --> 01:35:56.72
He's just freaking taken over, Blackjack's ready.

1343
01:35:56.72 --> 01:35:59.20
Oh yeah.

1344
01:35:59.20 --> 01:36:01.28
No hesitation whatsoever.

1345
01:36:01.28 --> 01:36:02.52
None.

1346
01:36:02.52 --> 01:36:04.92
Roger replies Mandolin.

1347
01:36:04.92 --> 01:36:08.000
Cowboy, I have two, have two men strip the bodies.

1348
01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:11.48
Get all weapons ammunition, maps, anything the NVA can use.

1349
01:36:11.48 --> 01:36:13.04
Distribute their gear to the team quickly.

1350
01:36:13.04 --> 01:36:17.20
Now, Cowboy interprets as the two immediately go to work on the bodies while the rest

1351
01:36:17.20 --> 01:36:19.68
of the rest continue returning fire.

1352
01:36:19.68 --> 01:36:21.24
Cowboy, come with me.

1353
01:36:21.24 --> 01:36:23.92
Tell loaks in command until we get back.

1354
01:36:23.92 --> 01:36:29.36
I give loka thumbs up as the two of us slowly crawl, advancing on hands and needs towards

1355
01:36:29.36 --> 01:36:34.80
a cluster of bushes, flicking aside a large black beetle as to not crush it.

1356
01:36:34.80 --> 01:36:37.08
That funny.

1357
01:36:37.08 --> 01:36:42.64
We're able to move close enough to the NVA that Cowboy hears their commander yelled as troops

1358
01:36:42.64 --> 01:36:45.76
prepared to charge their position.

1359
01:36:45.76 --> 01:36:50.14
At the periphery of my vision sits a small bird staring, sitting below the normal human

1360
01:36:50.14 --> 01:36:55.72
level of observation in an instant in a flicker of wings, advantages into the undergrowth.

1361
01:36:55.72 --> 01:36:57.48
I wish I could do that.

1362
01:36:57.48 --> 01:37:00.68
Just to be an after the beetle, everybody seems to be after somebody.

1363
01:37:00.68 --> 01:37:04.64
A kindhearted reverence for life pushes its way into my thoughts, get the Claymore out of

1364
01:37:04.64 --> 01:37:07.48
Cowboy's rock blasting cap from the survival vest.

1365
01:37:07.48 --> 01:37:08.48
That's it.

1366
01:37:08.48 --> 01:37:12.04
Cowboy finishes out a hand grenade and wire spool.

1367
01:37:12.04 --> 01:37:16.20
Hacily, we rigged the Claymore in the direction of those willing men from the north.

1368
01:37:16.20 --> 01:37:20.72
The loving husband and the son-in-law who likes to grow his own vegetables.

1369
01:37:20.72 --> 01:37:22.04
Fuck them all.

1370
01:37:22.04 --> 01:37:26.72
A cloud of shredded foliage rains down on Cowboy and me as we work our way back towards

1371
01:37:26.72 --> 01:37:30.24
Alabama, laying the detonation wires.

1372
01:37:30.24 --> 01:37:33.96
Get out of the line of fire, my little friend, I whisper after the bird.

1373
01:37:33.96 --> 01:37:39.60
The insistent husbands, brothers, and son-in-law's stampy towards our indefensible position

1374
01:37:39.60 --> 01:37:44.000
with weapons blazing, with their bulging veins frothing at the mouth, the lights are

1375
01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:46.32
their eyes wide.

1376
01:37:46.32 --> 01:37:48.56
Cowboy detonates the Claymore.

1377
01:37:48.56 --> 01:37:54.16
The air is filled with animal-like howls, gunfire, the smell of cordite, rotting vegetation,

1378
01:37:54.16 --> 01:37:56.48
and death.

1379
01:37:56.48 --> 01:38:00.64
We have blown a bloody path right down through the middle of them.

1380
01:38:00.64 --> 01:38:03.84
Claymore smokes clearing a yellow Alabama up.

1381
01:38:03.84 --> 01:38:05.80
Follow me.

1382
01:38:05.80 --> 01:38:10.60
The team moves through the path of carnage with our weapons on full auto as we assist the wounded.

1383
01:38:10.60 --> 01:38:15.12
Online, this is what you get for screen one of the black brothers.

1384
01:38:15.12 --> 01:38:20.64
What's left of their ragged lines sporadically fires into our small band, Cowboy stumbles

1385
01:38:20.64 --> 01:38:23.64
and falls having taken another round on his left side.

1386
01:38:23.64 --> 01:38:28.68
It comes ultimately to his feet, giving the okay signal, one seemingly through the past

1387
01:38:28.68 --> 01:38:35.16
NVA battle line, one seemingly through and past the NVA battle line, Luke Collap.

1388
01:38:35.16 --> 01:38:41.72
Collapses are online formation to inline and orders the team to go in on single shot.

1389
01:38:41.72 --> 01:38:46.20
The left of Cowboy sure to soak with blood, blocked by impossible terrain on one side

1390
01:38:46.20 --> 01:38:47.76
and NVA forces on the other.

1391
01:38:47.76 --> 01:38:52.36
We work our way through the dense undergrowth, back toward our point of insertion.

1392
01:38:52.36 --> 01:38:58.04
We are rear and in parallel on both flanks we can hear the NVA regrouping, gathering their

1393
01:38:58.04 --> 01:38:59.32
strength.

1394
01:38:59.32 --> 01:39:03.56
Random enemy shooting subsides as they begin firing signal shots to indicate the path

1395
01:39:03.56 --> 01:39:05.08
of our travel.

1396
01:39:05.08 --> 01:39:09.80
Flanking teams of two trackers for each enemy squad intermittently push us along.

1397
01:39:09.80 --> 01:39:13.36
As they reveal themselves, we cut them down with single shots.

1398
01:39:13.36 --> 01:39:14.60
Fire discipline is good.

1399
01:39:14.60 --> 01:39:18.72
Gotta find a place where we can stop to patch up our wounded.

1400
01:39:18.72 --> 01:39:20.48
Don't fire randomly.

1401
01:39:20.48 --> 01:39:21.48
Kill the enemy.

1402
01:39:21.48 --> 01:39:27.64
We continue maneuvering on our way through the high thick underbrush toward the primary

1403
01:39:27.64 --> 01:39:34.44
LZ leaving behind the striped the striped bodies of our point man, Howa and our 10-Jim

1404
01:39:34.44 --> 01:39:36.44
stride.

1405
01:39:36.44 --> 01:39:39.44
Oh, I know.

1406
01:39:39.44 --> 01:39:41.44
Can you imagine?

1407
01:39:41.44 --> 01:39:45.44
I mean, just how any of them lived.

1408
01:39:45.44 --> 01:39:45.44
Yeah.

1409
01:39:45.44 --> 01:39:52.44
It's amazing to see too.

1410
01:39:52.44 --> 01:39:59.16
Just to see someone step up both Blackjack and Cowboy.

1411
01:39:59.16 --> 01:40:00.16
Cowboys getting shot.

1412
01:40:00.16 --> 01:40:06.32
He's wounded and he's just leading and blins stepping up and leading when all this may

1413
01:40:06.32 --> 01:40:07.92
have him is taking.

1414
01:40:07.92 --> 01:40:12.56
And you know, I always say leadership is the most important thing on the battlefield.

1415
01:40:12.56 --> 01:40:15.56
If these guys didn't step up and lead, everyone's dead.

1416
01:40:15.56 --> 01:40:16.56
100%.

1417
01:40:16.56 --> 01:40:17.56
It's a guarantee.

1418
01:40:17.56 --> 01:40:18.56
These guys step up.

1419
01:40:18.56 --> 01:40:19.56
They take action.

1420
01:40:19.56 --> 01:40:21.56
They lead.

1421
01:40:21.56 --> 01:40:25.56
And at this point, they're going to look like they're going to get some progress.

1422
01:40:25.56 --> 01:40:26.56
Yeah.

1423
01:40:26.56 --> 01:40:29.56
His zero one was sharp and fearless because he rallied them.

1424
01:40:29.56 --> 01:40:34.24
Took care of the other details well then and Cowboy going on and poor Cowboy getting

1425
01:40:34.24 --> 01:40:36.56
hit the second time like that.

1426
01:40:36.56 --> 01:40:37.56
Oh my God.

1427
01:40:37.56 --> 01:40:39.56
He was a big Vietnamese.

1428
01:40:39.56 --> 01:40:40.56
He was taller than me.

1429
01:40:40.56 --> 01:40:41.56
Who is the zero one?

1430
01:40:41.56 --> 01:40:42.40
Cowboy.

1431
01:40:42.40 --> 01:40:43.40
He's the interpreter.

1432
01:40:43.40 --> 01:40:44.40
The zero one.

1433
01:40:44.40 --> 01:40:45.40
I forget his name.

1434
01:40:45.40 --> 01:40:46.40
You mentioned it there.

1435
01:40:46.40 --> 01:40:47.40
I was just a zero one.

1436
01:40:47.40 --> 01:40:49.40
That's our Vietnamese counterpart.

1437
01:40:49.40 --> 01:40:51.40
The one's the American is the zero one.

1438
01:40:51.40 --> 01:40:57.84
He's had the experience because Alabama for months earlier.

1439
01:40:57.84 --> 01:40:59.40
The entire team was wiped out.

1440
01:40:59.40 --> 01:41:01.68
The Sephora to one zero.

1441
01:41:01.68 --> 01:41:07.40
And he escaped and did a personal E and E back to the Ashwa Valley and picked them up.

1442
01:41:07.40 --> 01:41:10.60
So 68 was a bad year for Alabama.

1443
01:41:10.60 --> 01:41:14.20
But the zero one did not go on that faithful mission.

1444
01:41:14.20 --> 01:41:19.60
So he had his experience right over to fifth that between him and Cowboy.

1445
01:41:19.60 --> 01:41:20.60
Oh yeah, low.

1446
01:41:20.60 --> 01:41:21.60
Yeah.

1447
01:41:21.60 --> 01:41:22.60
That's who we're talking about.

1448
01:41:22.60 --> 01:41:24.60
Low is the zero one.

1449
01:41:24.60 --> 01:41:29.40
And then the other guy on there is Dote Quang who later became the idol.

1450
01:41:29.40 --> 01:41:32.60
I stole him from Alabama a couple years later.

1451
01:41:32.60 --> 01:41:33.60
He was great.

1452
01:41:33.60 --> 01:41:36.96
But just a fearless absolute warrior.

1453
01:41:36.96 --> 01:41:37.96
Bad asses.

1454
01:41:37.96 --> 01:41:38.96
Oh yeah.

1455
01:41:38.96 --> 01:41:41.96
I mean, it's crazy.

1456
01:41:41.96 --> 01:41:49.68
You know, the bombers in Europe, the bombers in Europe, the American bombers that

1457
01:41:49.68 --> 01:41:51.68
bombed Europe in World War II.

1458
01:41:51.68 --> 01:41:55.96
I think they had to do 25 missions if they did 25 missions they were done.

1459
01:41:55.96 --> 01:41:57.96
And sometimes they'd push a little further.

1460
01:41:57.96 --> 01:41:58.96
Yeah.

1461
01:41:58.96 --> 01:42:00.96
But yeah, that was what the rule in place was.

1462
01:42:00.96 --> 01:42:03.96
And the rule that they gave you guys was three.

1463
01:42:03.96 --> 01:42:08.92
And then those bombers, those guys were taking massive

1464
01:42:08.92 --> 01:42:09.92
casualties.

1465
01:42:09.92 --> 01:42:10.92
You know, mass casualties.

1466
01:42:10.92 --> 01:42:13.92
Oh, absolutely profound casualties.

1467
01:42:13.92 --> 01:42:16.36
And yet they said, hey, you guys are going to do 25 missions.

1468
01:42:16.36 --> 01:42:20.92
And you guys, they're saying, hey, listen, can we get three out of you?

1469
01:42:20.92 --> 01:42:21.92
Yeah.

1470
01:42:21.92 --> 01:42:24.76
See, now, we never, I don't remember that part of the brief.

1471
01:42:24.76 --> 01:42:27.64
If we ever had it, see, then remember those details.

1472
01:42:27.64 --> 01:42:29.92
That's why his stuff was just so great.

1473
01:42:29.92 --> 01:42:30.92
It's vivid.

1474
01:42:30.92 --> 01:42:33.44
Yeah, I don't forget they told the bombers.

1475
01:42:33.44 --> 01:42:34.44
Remember the Frenchman.

1476
01:42:34.44 --> 01:42:35.44
His dad was the lead.

1477
01:42:35.44 --> 01:42:36.44
Right.

1478
01:42:36.44 --> 01:42:37.92
On that one squadron.

1479
01:42:37.92 --> 01:42:41.92
23, only one comes back out of 1,000 airplanes.

1480
01:42:41.92 --> 01:42:52.92
So yeah, same catastrophic effects by the enemy.

1481
01:42:52.92 --> 01:42:57.92
Continuing on October 5, Blackjack, Mandolin, were returning with the King Bees

1482
01:42:57.92 --> 01:42:59.92
to food buy for fuel.

1483
01:42:59.92 --> 01:43:05.92
No extraction is possible for at least two, maybe three hours over.

1484
01:43:05.92 --> 01:43:07.92
The Kobe is on station.

1485
01:43:07.92 --> 01:43:10.92
You'll be talking to Spiderman.

1486
01:43:10.92 --> 01:43:13.92
This fast is possible.

1487
01:43:13.92 --> 01:43:17.92
Mandolin, we're about to find out how much longer we can hold out.

1488
01:43:17.92 --> 01:43:19.92
Don't panic Blackjack, find the path.

1489
01:43:19.92 --> 01:43:21.92
Don't let them pin you down.

1490
01:43:21.92 --> 01:43:26.92
Spiderman or Bob Parks, X10 of RT Idaho, just like Mandolin.

1491
01:43:26.92 --> 01:43:29.92
Spiderman, Blackjack over.

1492
01:43:29.92 --> 01:43:30.92
Blackjack, Spiderman.

1493
01:43:30.92 --> 01:43:32.92
Keeping your cool buddy.

1494
01:43:32.92 --> 01:43:33.92
Keeping your cool buddy.

1495
01:43:33.92 --> 01:43:35.92
He's there. We're not alone.

1496
01:43:35.92 --> 01:43:41.92
Man, having you guys with that direct relationship with your cubbies and they sat in the briefs

1497
01:43:41.92 --> 01:43:43.92
and they knew what you were going to do.

1498
01:43:43.92 --> 01:43:45.92
That's a powerful thing.

1499
01:43:45.92 --> 01:43:46.92
That was a key.

1500
01:43:46.92 --> 01:43:48.92
Having that rider.

1501
01:43:48.92 --> 01:43:50.92
And that's the epitome of it.

1502
01:43:50.92 --> 01:43:51.92
That moment in time right there.

1503
01:43:51.92 --> 01:43:53.92
Because lens like, oh, walk this is gone.

1504
01:43:53.92 --> 01:43:54.92
The King Bees are gone.

1505
01:43:54.92 --> 01:43:57.92
Nobody's going to come back for two or three hours.

1506
01:43:57.92 --> 01:43:58.92
You be cool.

1507
01:43:58.92 --> 01:44:00.92
There's spider talking to him.

1508
01:44:00.92 --> 01:44:03.92
Then I'd be for his feet and his ass and liars dice at the club.

1509
01:44:03.92 --> 01:44:07.92
I don't know if you ever heard this story, but Dave Burke.

1510
01:44:07.92 --> 01:44:08.92
Good deal.

1511
01:44:08.92 --> 01:44:08.92
Yeah.

1512
01:44:08.92 --> 01:44:12.92
He was in Ramadi and he's Anglico, supported.

1513
01:44:12.92 --> 01:44:14.92
I think he's supporting an army unit.

1514
01:44:14.92 --> 01:44:18.92
And it's the first real closer support that he's actually calling.

1515
01:44:18.92 --> 01:44:21.92
And he's a former F or he's an F 18 pilot.

1516
01:44:21.92 --> 01:44:27.92
And it just so happens by coincidence and miracle and other coincidence that he

1517
01:44:27.92 --> 01:44:30.92
keys up the mic and says this is lightning six.

1518
01:44:30.92 --> 01:44:34.92
And the guy that answers the guy that's in the air about to give

1519
01:44:34.92 --> 01:44:36.92
Organs form is like one of his buddies.

1520
01:44:36.92 --> 01:44:37.92
No.

1521
01:44:37.92 --> 01:44:40.92
And he says something like, hey, chip, it's you know, hey, chip.

1522
01:44:40.92 --> 01:44:41.92
It's Maverick.

1523
01:44:41.92 --> 01:44:42.92
I'm ready to rock and roll.

1524
01:44:42.92 --> 01:44:44.92
He goes, oh, it's like this.

1525
01:44:44.92 --> 01:44:47.92
So having that relationship that you guys had with these

1526
01:44:47.92 --> 01:44:48.92
Cubbies, man.

1527
01:44:48.92 --> 01:44:49.92
Cool.

1528
01:44:49.92 --> 01:44:50.92
Absolutely.

1529
01:44:50.92 --> 01:44:54.92
So he says keeping your cool buddy.

1530
01:44:54.92 --> 01:44:57.92
Stand by spider. They're pushing us from all sides. We're moving

1531
01:44:57.92 --> 01:45:01.92
Back towards the LZ perimeter and we'll be ready for extraction over

1532
01:45:01.92 --> 01:45:03.92
Grabbing a claymore from one of the Rucksacks.

1533
01:45:03.92 --> 01:45:06.92
I set up a 10 second fuse pointing to it to our rear while low covers

1534
01:45:06.92 --> 01:45:09.92
Me. We can hear them screaming in agony as we move through the

1535
01:45:09.92 --> 01:45:12.92
Brut Bush back towards our insertion.

1536
01:45:12.92 --> 01:45:17.92
And you know what, before we go on, I just want to go back to this

1537
01:45:17.92 --> 01:45:22.92
because it's a, it's a little bit of a point of contention in the book.

1538
01:45:22.92 --> 01:45:26.92
If you remember, I read this part where he says we continue maneuvering our way

1539
01:45:26.92 --> 01:45:29.92
through the high thick underbrush toward the primary LZ,

1540
01:45:29.92 --> 01:45:33.92
leaving behind the stripped bodies of our point man,

1541
01:45:33.92 --> 01:45:36.92
Howa and our one zero Jim Stride.

1542
01:45:36.92 --> 01:45:39.92
So he had to make a decision.

1543
01:45:39.92 --> 01:45:42.92
The hardest possible decision that a person could have to make,

1544
01:45:42.92 --> 01:45:44.92
which is, hey, these guys are dead.

1545
01:45:44.92 --> 01:45:47.92
We're going to strip their bodies and we're going to leave them

1546
01:45:47.92 --> 01:45:51.92
because if we try and look, anybody that hasn't ever carried a

1547
01:45:51.92 --> 01:45:55.92
freaking, another human being through rough terrain, you have no idea.

1548
01:45:55.92 --> 01:45:58.92
You have no idea look and you can say, I'll pick up my bow pick up

1549
01:45:58.92 --> 01:46:01.92
echo right now and I'll run, you know, across the parking lot or

1550
01:46:01.92 --> 01:46:03.92
whatever, run 100 yards.

1551
01:46:03.92 --> 01:46:05.92
Yeah, it might not seem like that big of a deal.

1552
01:46:05.92 --> 01:46:09.92
If you make echo actual dead weight, where he's not helping

1553
01:46:09.92 --> 01:46:13.92
in any way, not adjusting his weight on you, not holding on to your

1554
01:46:13.92 --> 01:46:15.92
neck or holding onto your shoulders.

1555
01:46:15.92 --> 01:46:17.92
None of that. If it's just true dead weight,

1556
01:46:17.92 --> 01:46:21.92
200 and five pounds or 210 pounds or whatever,

1557
01:46:21.92 --> 01:46:26.92
way too, 220, but 220. Okay, 220 pounds of dead weight.

1558
01:46:26.92 --> 01:46:29.92
You're 185.

1559
01:46:29.92 --> 01:46:31.92
It's not that big of a deal to do it.

1560
01:46:31.92 --> 01:46:34.92
It's not when you pick up a body and you carry him across the

1561
01:46:34.92 --> 01:46:38.92
field, the football field or the parking lot, it's not that big of a deal.

1562
01:46:38.92 --> 01:46:42.92
When they're dead weight, it's totally different when you're

1563
01:46:42.92 --> 01:46:44.92
in terrain, it's even more different.

1564
01:46:44.92 --> 01:46:48.92
And then when you're getting freaking shot at and assaulted by a

1565
01:46:48.92 --> 01:46:51.92
massive number of NVA, you got to make a decision.

1566
01:46:51.92 --> 01:46:54.92
What are we going to do? Are we going to survive?

1567
01:46:54.92 --> 01:46:57.92
Or are we going to perish to save our friends body?

1568
01:46:57.92 --> 01:47:00.92
What would I want? What would, what would, if I was shot,

1569
01:47:00.92 --> 01:47:02.92
if I was dead, what would I want you to do?

1570
01:47:02.92 --> 01:47:06.92
All die to bring my body out, hell no, you get your ass out of there.

1571
01:47:06.92 --> 01:47:11.92
And so Lynn had to make this decision and he made it quick and

1572
01:47:11.92 --> 01:47:13.92
you know, that's how you survive.

1573
01:47:13.92 --> 01:47:14.92
Oh yeah.

1574
01:47:14.92 --> 01:47:18.92
It wasn't easy, but he did the right thing.

1575
01:47:18.92 --> 01:47:19.92
Yeah.

1576
01:47:19.92 --> 01:47:21.92
That's what you got to do.

1577
01:47:21.92 --> 01:47:25.92
It's not like, and by the way, when you when you leave that body,

1578
01:47:25.92 --> 01:47:27.92
you're not saying, oh, we're never going to do anything.

1579
01:47:27.92 --> 01:47:30.92
No, you go do a bright light. You could do what you got to do to

1580
01:47:30.92 --> 01:47:33.92
once you get your forces assembled and you can get more guys and

1581
01:47:33.92 --> 01:47:36.92
you can get the right air covering all that stuff.

1582
01:47:36.92 --> 01:47:39.92
You're not abandoning them, but at that moment in time,

1583
01:47:39.92 --> 01:47:42.92
you got to make a decision for the survivability of the team.

1584
01:47:42.92 --> 01:47:45.92
It just, that's what you have to do.

1585
01:47:45.92 --> 01:47:48.92
Here's his thoughts, wait a minute.

1586
01:47:48.92 --> 01:47:49.92
We just marked our location.

1587
01:47:49.92 --> 01:47:51.92
How stupid was that?

1588
01:47:51.92 --> 01:47:53.92
This is after they blow after they blow up a claymore.

1589
01:47:53.92 --> 01:47:55.92
They're like, oh, that was a bad move.

1590
01:47:55.92 --> 01:47:57.92
We just marked our location.

1591
01:47:57.92 --> 01:47:59.92
Evade stay out of contact as long as possible.

1592
01:47:59.92 --> 01:48:00.92
Yeah, right.

1593
01:48:00.92 --> 01:48:05.92
The NVA, no, we're heading toward the LZ and are trying to push us onto it to

1594
01:48:05.92 --> 01:48:07.92
where we'll be easier targets.

1595
01:48:07.92 --> 01:48:10.92
They intend to use us as bait so they can shoot down more helicopters.

1596
01:48:10.92 --> 01:48:14.92
Once we're dead and the helicopters are down, the line weight for the

1597
01:48:14.92 --> 01:48:17.92
bright light rescue choppers.

1598
01:48:17.92 --> 01:48:18.92
Screw that.

1599
01:48:18.92 --> 01:48:21.92
Today it's not going to, today it's going to end with us.

1600
01:48:21.92 --> 01:48:25.92
Dead or alive, these bastards aren't going to use me as bait.

1601
01:48:25.92 --> 01:48:29.92
Maybe we can bait them out on the LZ where our gunships can get it.

1602
01:48:29.92 --> 01:48:31.92
Them hunt the hunters.

1603
01:48:31.92 --> 01:48:33.92
They're going to be a good idea.

1604
01:48:33.92 --> 01:48:38.92
They're going to be a good idea.

1605
01:48:38.92 --> 01:48:41.92
These are the LZ thoughts.

1606
01:48:41.92 --> 01:48:48.92
Quickly working through cowboy, loken I decide to turn back against the NVA.

1607
01:48:48.92 --> 01:48:50.92
We employ fire and maneuver.

1608
01:48:50.92 --> 01:48:54.92
18 firing wall, beat team is maneuvering, searching, destroying and clearing a path.

1609
01:48:54.92 --> 01:48:57.92
Old school cover move.

1610
01:48:57.92 --> 01:49:01.92
We turn moving back through the claymore swath until we encounter the

1611
01:49:01.92 --> 01:49:06.92
larger enemy force all lines searching us out.

1612
01:49:06.92 --> 01:49:10.92
Down, weight, ready, fire, red and green creep.

1613
01:49:10.92 --> 01:49:15.92
Red and green traitors fill the air moving like rush hour traffic lights.

1614
01:49:15.92 --> 01:49:18.92
We are able to grease a couple of platoon size forces.

1615
01:49:18.92 --> 01:49:23.92
Up on me, Alabama forms up as I point south west towards the LZ.

1616
01:49:23.92 --> 01:49:27.92
A new NVA line is flooding in this behind searching us out.

1617
01:49:27.92 --> 01:49:31.92
They are using grenades to clear the jungle as they move.

1618
01:49:31.92 --> 01:49:36.92
Whistles are sounding on two sides indicating we are moving into a possible ambush.

1619
01:49:36.92 --> 01:49:41.92
They're attempting to hurt us together on the edge of the LZ where there's a

1620
01:49:41.92 --> 01:49:46.92
2,000 foot shear drop on the southern edge.

1621
01:49:46.92 --> 01:49:51.92
Alabama online yells low, pointing our direction of travel.

1622
01:49:51.92 --> 01:49:57.92
Boldly, we charge pushing them back, mowing them down like weeds, bold move.

1623
01:49:57.92 --> 01:50:01.92
We close to the perimeter to the LZ perimeter.

1624
01:50:01.92 --> 01:50:03.92
Don't let them force us out into the open.

1625
01:50:03.92 --> 01:50:06.92
A fast moving object enters my peripheral vision.

1626
01:50:06.92 --> 01:50:10.92
Wack, my head is snapped back by a wooden handlebed grenade.

1627
01:50:10.92 --> 01:50:13.92
Instantly I'm looking into the jungle canopy.

1628
01:50:13.92 --> 01:50:17.92
Seeing a muddled green light stream through a haze of cordite.

1629
01:50:17.92 --> 01:50:18.92
It's over.

1630
01:50:18.92 --> 01:50:20.92
You saw it coming and couldn't get out of the way.

1631
01:50:20.92 --> 01:50:25.92
Lower below me, the concussion lifts me from the ground pushing me through the air.

1632
01:50:25.92 --> 01:50:30.92
My feet are over my head, green tracers track, crack around me like lady finger firecrackers.

1633
01:50:30.92 --> 01:50:33.92
That tree is upside down and moving fast.

1634
01:50:33.92 --> 01:50:34.92
This is all wrong.

1635
01:50:34.92 --> 01:50:36.92
Focus your your missed the moment of your death.

1636
01:50:36.92 --> 01:50:39.92
I hear myself say I can't breathe.

1637
01:50:39.92 --> 01:50:41.92
I feel like I'm drowning.

1638
01:50:41.92 --> 01:50:45.92
The team, they are frantically beating me back to consciousness, pouring water over my head.

1639
01:50:45.92 --> 01:50:46.92
Okay, okay, I'm back.

1640
01:50:46.92 --> 01:50:47.92
I try to get up.

1641
01:50:47.92 --> 01:50:49.92
My legs don't work.

1642
01:50:49.92 --> 01:50:53.92
From the knees down my fatigue pants are shredded and I'm bleeding.

1643
01:50:53.92 --> 01:50:57.92
One of the men, quang, start smearing.

1644
01:50:57.92 --> 01:51:01.92
Jell it's an eyes to rise on my legs, arms, face and chest.

1645
01:51:01.92 --> 01:51:03.92
Web gear and what is left of my survival vest,

1646
01:51:03.92 --> 01:51:07.92
relying on the ground and bloody tatters along with the car 15.

1647
01:51:07.92 --> 01:51:11.92
It's bent where the barrel meets the receiver and the bolt can't be pulled back.

1648
01:51:11.92 --> 01:51:14.92
Locer orders a scout to bury the car.

1649
01:51:14.92 --> 01:51:16.92
Cowboy hands me strides weapon.

1650
01:51:16.92 --> 01:51:18.92
Cowboy, what's wrong with your hand?

1651
01:51:18.92 --> 01:51:19.92
Grnage, trapple.

1652
01:51:19.92 --> 01:51:24.92
He wins his handing me the weapon.

1653
01:51:24.92 --> 01:51:27.92
You have now officially pissed me off.

1654
01:51:27.92 --> 01:51:30.92
I scream at the end of the day.

1655
01:51:30.92 --> 01:51:34.92
So at this point, they're doing fire maneuver.

1656
01:51:34.92 --> 01:51:36.92
They're getting to the edge of the LZ.

1657
01:51:36.92 --> 01:51:39.92
He gets hit in the head with a freaking grenade.

1658
01:51:39.92 --> 01:51:42.92
And then it detonates, blows him up in the air.

1659
01:51:42.92 --> 01:51:44.92
Destroyed his car 15.

1660
01:51:44.92 --> 01:51:46.92
Destroyed his car 15.

1661
01:51:46.92 --> 01:51:52.92
Yeah, this is after they charge through the NBA rank.

1662
01:51:52.92 --> 01:51:54.92
They go through them.

1663
01:51:54.92 --> 01:51:58.92
It's like, even in my best day, I don't think I would have thought of that.

1664
01:51:58.92 --> 01:52:00.92
It had to be somebody like them.

1665
01:52:00.92 --> 01:52:02.92
It's just such a distinct courageous move.

1666
01:52:02.92 --> 01:52:06.92
It is and it's one of those things where that's the last thing that the enemies could think she're going to do.

1667
01:52:06.92 --> 01:52:09.92
And they probably just, it was the last thing they would think.

1668
01:52:09.92 --> 01:52:10.92
Yeah.

1669
01:52:10.92 --> 01:52:11.92
And then when it happens, they're not ready for it.

1670
01:52:11.92 --> 01:52:12.92
They're like, what's happening?

1671
01:52:12.92 --> 01:52:16.92
Is it brilliant? Just a brilliant move.

1672
01:52:16.92 --> 01:52:20.92
So he says you have now officially pissed me off.

1673
01:52:20.92 --> 01:52:22.92
I scream at the NBA.

1674
01:52:22.92 --> 01:52:24.92
God damn, I hit her to do that.

1675
01:52:24.92 --> 01:52:26.92
Scrabbling around my position.

1676
01:52:26.92 --> 01:52:28.92
I finally find the radio handset.

1677
01:52:28.92 --> 01:52:29.92
Spider-Blackjack.

1678
01:52:29.92 --> 01:52:33.92
I'm declaring a Prairie Fire Emergency.

1679
01:52:33.92 --> 01:52:36.92
A Prairie Fire Emergency should drop enough maypom on you.

1680
01:52:36.92 --> 01:52:38.92
Sockers to ruin your day.

1681
01:52:38.92 --> 01:52:38.92
Laughing.

1682
01:52:38.92 --> 01:52:42.92
The reply comes, blackjack, no kidding brother.

1683
01:52:42.92 --> 01:52:44.92
Keep your cool.

1684
01:52:44.92 --> 01:52:46.92
Above all else.

1685
01:52:46.92 --> 01:52:48.92
Keep your cool.

1686
01:52:48.92 --> 01:52:50.92
So that's awesome.

1687
01:52:50.92 --> 01:52:54.92
I mean, Spider-Head already said, hey, this, we've already moved an assets into place.

1688
01:52:54.92 --> 01:52:58.92
He can tell that this is a shit sandwich down here.

1689
01:52:58.92 --> 01:53:00.92
And then he gives this advice.

1690
01:53:00.92 --> 01:53:02.92
You know, this is advice we can all use.

1691
01:53:02.92 --> 01:53:03.92
Keep your cool.

1692
01:53:03.92 --> 01:53:04.92
Above all else.

1693
01:53:04.92 --> 01:53:05.92
Keep your cool.

1694
01:53:05.92 --> 01:53:06.92
Oh yeah.

1695
01:53:06.92 --> 01:53:09.92
And that means so much because it's coming from Spider,

1696
01:53:09.92 --> 01:53:11.92
who's a who's a one zero himself.

1697
01:53:11.92 --> 01:53:13.92
It's been on the ground.

1698
01:53:13.92 --> 01:53:14.92
But knows what's happening.

1699
01:53:14.92 --> 01:53:16.92
And he's saying above all else.

1700
01:53:16.92 --> 01:53:18.92
Keep your cool.

1701
01:53:18.92 --> 01:53:20.92
And so then he says to himself,

1702
01:53:20.92 --> 01:53:22.92
calm the hell down, blackjack.

1703
01:53:22.92 --> 01:53:23.92
Be cool.

1704
01:53:23.92 --> 01:53:24.92
So that actually worked.

1705
01:53:24.92 --> 01:53:25.92
He actually listened.

1706
01:53:25.92 --> 01:53:27.92
Spider, blackjack.

1707
01:53:27.92 --> 01:53:30.92
So what's our asset status over?

1708
01:53:30.92 --> 01:53:32.92
All assets have been diverted to your location.

1709
01:53:32.92 --> 01:53:35.92
Covey will coordinate them as they arrive and let you know what armament is available.

1710
01:53:35.92 --> 01:53:37.92
You make the decision what you want,

1711
01:53:37.92 --> 01:53:39.92
when and where you want it.

1712
01:53:39.92 --> 01:53:40.92
Any questions?

1713
01:53:40.92 --> 01:53:41.92
Who's up first?

1714
01:53:41.92 --> 01:53:43.92
I attempt to rise but fall flat on my face.

1715
01:53:43.92 --> 01:53:44.92
God damn it.

1716
01:53:44.92 --> 01:53:47.92
Six gunships will prep the LZ with gun and rocket runs.

1717
01:53:47.92 --> 01:53:50.92
Amongst them will one will attempt to land.

1718
01:53:50.92 --> 01:53:52.92
If that's not possible,

1719
01:53:52.92 --> 01:53:54.92
it will trail a ladder.

1720
01:53:54.92 --> 01:53:56.92
Improvise brother, Roger Spider.

1721
01:53:56.92 --> 01:54:00.92
I roll over hugging the radio receiver to my ear.

1722
01:54:00.92 --> 01:54:02.92
Trying to get to my feet.

1723
01:54:02.92 --> 01:54:06.92
The gunships fire rockets and then make gun runs near our position.

1724
01:54:06.92 --> 01:54:09.92
The rescue ship attempts to land twice.

1725
01:54:09.92 --> 01:54:11.92
Twice we make our move.

1726
01:54:11.92 --> 01:54:13.92
Too much lead in the air.

1727
01:54:13.92 --> 01:54:15.92
Ground fires much too intense.

1728
01:54:15.92 --> 01:54:17.92
They're hammering our pickup to pieces.

1729
01:54:17.92 --> 01:54:18.92
Get it out of here.

1730
01:54:18.92 --> 01:54:19.92
Spider, do you copy?

1731
01:54:19.92 --> 01:54:20.92
Over.

1732
01:54:20.92 --> 01:54:26.92
The rescue ship limps off while the Wal-Marine scar face ships expand their ordinance and covering fire.

1733
01:54:26.92 --> 01:54:27.92
Blackjack.

1734
01:54:27.92 --> 01:54:28.92
Spider.

1735
01:54:28.92 --> 01:54:33.92
Spider.

1736
01:54:33.92 --> 01:54:36.92
A crime scene.

1737
01:54:36.92 --> 01:54:37.92
ша.

1738
01:54:37.92 --> 01:54:41.92
A president, a man, on the right.

1739
01:54:41.92 --> 01:54:43.92
India authority.

1740
01:54:43.92 --> 01:54:43.92
Another anger, there's no�� agreement between the six friends and you.

1741
01:54:43.92 --> 01:54:46.92
Later, a fan of government.

1742
01:54:46.92 --> 01:54:52.92
They need to spend timeying time of retirement.

1743
01:54:51.92 --> 01:54:53.34
When there was a massive bomb fight,

1744
01:54:55.18 --> 01:54:57.88
a field break at the bag and a building.

1745
01:54:57.88 --> 01:55:02.88
It's like, this is not going to be a good day.

1746
01:55:02.88 --> 01:55:04.88
And you just don't know.

1747
01:55:04.88 --> 01:55:07.88
Can you hear what the aircraft are?

1748
01:55:07.88 --> 01:55:10.88
I know you can't hear what the guy's on the ground are saying because they're on the ground

1749
01:55:10.88 --> 01:55:12.88
and they're not lying to sites so you wouldn't be able.

1750
01:55:12.88 --> 01:55:15.88
Could you guys hear what the aircraft are saying back to the guy's on the ground?

1751
01:55:15.88 --> 01:55:20.88
When you get to work up some of spiders transmission in the petwalk because you can hear some of it.

1752
01:55:20.88 --> 01:55:23.88
Could depend on where they were, how low they were and up.

1753
01:55:23.88 --> 01:55:24.88
So we picked up some.

1754
01:55:24.88 --> 01:55:29.88
We just knew it was a shit show because the whole camp, this is a siren.

1755
01:55:29.88 --> 01:55:33.88
Everybody just came to a pause and started praying for them.

1756
01:55:33.88 --> 01:55:36.88
And so what are you guys, so are you the one zero?

1757
01:55:36.88 --> 01:55:38.88
No, Don Walk was the one zero back then.

1758
01:55:38.88 --> 01:55:42.88
I was the one one for Idaho and they talked about the bright light.

1759
01:55:42.88 --> 01:55:46.88
Don had gone for the brief and they said, we might be the bright light.

1760
01:55:46.88 --> 01:55:49.88
What's your, what are you doing when you're, when you might be the bright light?

1761
01:55:49.88 --> 01:55:51.88
Do you already have all your mags or all loaded?

1762
01:55:51.88 --> 01:55:52.88
Yeah, we already have.

1763
01:55:52.88 --> 01:55:55.88
I'll present nice the next day you just, we'll just take anything out.

1764
01:55:55.88 --> 01:55:58.88
Then it's just all bolts and grenades and extra bandages.

1765
01:55:58.88 --> 01:56:00.88
Maybe a couple body bags.

1766
01:56:00.88 --> 01:56:04.88
And then we never even got to the launch site.

1767
01:56:04.88 --> 01:56:12.88
They cancel it because they, they'd be between the enemy, the anti aircraft and then the weather.

1768
01:56:12.88 --> 01:56:17.88
Because it started clouded over and then all the guns smoke, the cordi.

1769
01:56:17.88 --> 01:56:19.88
And then the clouds.

1770
01:56:19.88 --> 01:56:22.88
They figured one more team went in.

1771
01:56:22.88 --> 01:56:27.88
We've been more casualty and the, and the king be like, like, what lint just described.

1772
01:56:27.88 --> 01:56:27.88
Yeah.

1773
01:56:27.88 --> 01:56:30.88
The first attempt to get him out just like get out of here.

1774
01:56:30.88 --> 01:56:32.88
You just want to live themselves.

1775
01:56:32.88 --> 01:56:37.88
Yeah, which you think about the mindset of Lynn Black.

1776
01:56:37.88 --> 01:56:37.88
Yeah.

1777
01:56:37.88 --> 01:56:42.88
Your savior is coming down to rescue you.

1778
01:56:42.88 --> 01:56:44.88
And you say, nope, get out of here.

1779
01:56:44.88 --> 01:56:45.88
Yeah.

1780
01:56:45.88 --> 01:56:48.88
What an honorable move beyond.

1781
01:56:48.88 --> 01:56:49.88
Yeah.

1782
01:56:49.88 --> 01:56:50.88
Yeah.

1783
01:56:50.88 --> 01:56:57.88
He says, so he says, so, so spider says, hey, we're getting a bright light ready for you.

1784
01:56:57.88 --> 01:57:01.52
And then Blackjack, spider Blackjack, how would they get in here?

1785
01:57:01.52 --> 01:57:04.88
We don't need more people on the ground or helicopter shot down.

1786
01:57:04.88 --> 01:57:06.88
Don't let the NVA use us as bait.

1787
01:57:06.88 --> 01:57:09.88
We need to get off the ground and out of line of fire.

1788
01:57:09.88 --> 01:57:14.88
In the meantime, what I really need is a resupply of ammo over.

1789
01:57:14.88 --> 01:57:16.88
Blackjack, you okay?

1790
01:57:16.88 --> 01:57:18.88
Got nailed with her grenade, nothing serious over.

1791
01:57:18.88 --> 01:57:20.88
Just can't walk.

1792
01:57:20.88 --> 01:57:24.88
Ammo's on the way and I agree with your assessment of the bright light over.

1793
01:57:24.88 --> 01:57:28.88
Spider, tell food by Alabama is not a sacrificial lamb.

1794
01:57:28.88 --> 01:57:30.88
No bright light over.

1795
01:57:30.88 --> 01:57:34.88
So not only do you call off his helicopter from coming in, he's calling off the rescue

1796
01:57:34.88 --> 01:57:35.88
mission himself.

1797
01:57:35.88 --> 01:57:38.88
He's saying, hey, don't send a bright light.

1798
01:57:38.88 --> 01:57:40.88
I'm glad he said that.

1799
01:57:40.88 --> 01:57:44.88
He says, Roger Blackjack, bye.

1800
01:57:44.88 --> 01:57:49.88
The way the assets are beginning to have difficulty with the weather and smoke hanging

1801
01:57:49.88 --> 01:57:54.88
over the LZ, you're difficult to spot, which makes accurate air strikes increasingly

1802
01:57:54.88 --> 01:57:56.88
difficult over.

1803
01:57:56.88 --> 01:58:02.88
Cowboy is working on my legs while he's telling the Boku NVA on LZ.

1804
01:58:02.88 --> 01:58:07.88
We can hear gunships overhead in witness NVA Tracer's riddling the lead ship.

1805
01:58:07.88 --> 01:58:12.88
The NVA move across the grassy plane of the LZ, like a work-party of ants,

1806
01:58:12.88 --> 01:58:17.88
trampling down the two-foot razor grass, which is the only concealment we have.

1807
01:58:17.88 --> 01:58:22.88
Sun the one-one panics, shouting skyward, God save us.

1808
01:58:22.88 --> 01:58:26.88
The NVA swore migrates in our direction.

1809
01:58:26.88 --> 01:58:34.88
So the one-one who's been freaked out this whole time and hasn't done his job.

1810
01:58:34.88 --> 01:58:40.88
Now yells out, God save us and the NVA hear it.

1811
01:58:40.88 --> 01:58:44.88
Vietanemies team members speaking through Cowboy say,

1812
01:58:44.88 --> 01:58:47.88
we're going to kill one one if he doesn't shut up.

1813
01:58:47.88 --> 01:58:49.88
I'll pull the trigger on him myself.

1814
01:58:49.88 --> 01:58:50.88
I agree.

1815
01:58:50.88 --> 01:58:54.88
Too early one-one whispers, whimper's God forgive you.

1816
01:58:54.88 --> 01:59:00.88
Sounds of an approaching King B, King B, and our diversion as the carrots of survival are

1817
01:59:00.88 --> 01:59:01.88
dangled in front of us again.

1818
01:59:01.88 --> 01:59:03.88
Each King B, King B, can hold four.

1819
01:59:03.88 --> 01:59:05.88
So we got to get everyone out on two.

1820
01:59:05.88 --> 01:59:08.88
Sure hope they brought a dozen to this party.

1821
01:59:08.88 --> 01:59:12.88
We've met, we've got to get to the center of the LV, help the wounded move.

1822
01:59:12.88 --> 01:59:14.88
I scream in one-one's face.

1823
01:59:14.88 --> 01:59:19.88
Fearfully confused one-one takes hold of Locke, who is in the who brushes him off with

1824
01:59:19.88 --> 01:59:20.88
the stain.

1825
01:59:20.88 --> 01:59:24.88
Blackjack, spider, first King B, inbound.

1826
01:59:24.88 --> 01:59:29.88
Gunships begin prepping the LZ with Rock, Rockets, 40-Might-Might-Might-Might-Might-M-M-60s.

1827
01:59:29.88 --> 01:59:30.88
Blackjack, spider.

1828
01:59:30.88 --> 01:59:34.88
I've got a fast move around track, key your handsets, so he can get a lock.

1829
01:59:34.88 --> 01:59:36.88
Put your heads in the dirt over.

1830
01:59:36.88 --> 01:59:41.88
Roger, hand-set, keyed heads down.

1831
01:59:41.88 --> 01:59:49.88
We look into the Hayes Street Sun as a full-flaped fan of his glide path ratio critical.

1832
01:59:49.88 --> 01:59:54.88
Ignites the tree line across the LZ into sheets of white yellow and orange flames.

1833
01:59:54.88 --> 01:59:59.88
The ship banks sharply after burners crank on and he powers into the valley below.

1834
01:59:59.88 --> 02:00:07.88
NVA, small arms open up on three sides, lazy, wagging tongues of green, tracer, fire,

1835
02:00:07.88 --> 02:00:10.88
sweep of sky for miles.

1836
02:00:10.88 --> 02:00:14.88
Heavy AAA, fire, chase the NF4.

1837
02:00:14.88 --> 02:00:17.88
Jesus, some of those guns aren't far from our location.

1838
02:00:17.88 --> 02:00:19.88
How many of these bastards are there?

1839
02:00:19.88 --> 02:00:21.88
What the hell are we in the middle of?

1840
02:00:21.88 --> 02:00:23.88
King my handset, spider, blackjack.

1841
02:00:23.88 --> 02:00:25.88
Did you see that anti-aircraft fire on the fast mover?

1842
02:00:25.88 --> 02:00:26.88
Over.

1843
02:00:26.88 --> 02:00:27.88
Roger, blackjack.

1844
02:00:27.88 --> 02:00:29.88
Marking map coordinates now.

1845
02:00:29.88 --> 02:00:32.88
This is mandolin back on station over.

1846
02:00:32.88 --> 02:00:36.88
So they've gone from spider as the cubby.

1847
02:00:36.88 --> 02:00:40.88
Well, from mandolin to spider, now we're back to mandolin.

1848
02:00:40.88 --> 02:00:43.88
And by the way, props to that F4 fan.

1849
02:00:43.88 --> 02:00:47.88
We've had a couple of F4 fanom Vietnam pilots on here.

1850
02:00:47.88 --> 02:00:52.88
Those guys were doing a freaking doing God's work up there,

1851
02:00:52.88 --> 02:00:56.88
especially in a case like this, dropping Nae Palm to save these guys.

1852
02:00:56.88 --> 02:01:02.88
Among those shooting are several NVA about 20 feet from our perimeter.

1853
02:01:02.88 --> 02:01:06.88
Nae Palm torches the jungle, forcing dozens of the enemy to scurry onto the LZ,

1854
02:01:06.88 --> 02:01:12.88
escaping the inferno and gulfing their comrades just as another F4 rolls in for a gun run.

1855
02:01:12.88 --> 02:01:17.88
The NVA move it, move in close to us, making every possible attempt to avoid the firestorm.

1856
02:01:17.88 --> 02:01:22.88
Firing on single shot, we begin to pick them off as they stream out of the fire,

1857
02:01:22.88 --> 02:01:24.88
drenched jungle.

1858
02:01:24.88 --> 02:01:29.88
Those close to us endeavor to suppress our fire attempting to protect their comrades.

1859
02:01:29.88 --> 02:01:34.88
Their friends, fathers, brothers, uncles that onion-eating sun and law.

1860
02:01:34.88 --> 02:01:37.88
As they pop up, we put them down.

1861
02:01:37.88 --> 02:01:42.88
Phanoms return with two cannon and gun runs along our perimeter.

1862
02:01:42.88 --> 02:01:49.88
And I haven't really gone into this, but you can hear a couple of times that Lynn has referred to the enemy

1863
02:01:49.88 --> 02:01:58.88
as fathers and sons and brothers and uncles. He just does that to kind of let you know what he's thinking about.

1864
02:01:58.88 --> 02:02:02.88
And he's thinking like, yeah, these are other men and we're about to kill him.

1865
02:02:02.88 --> 02:02:04.88
That's the way it goes.

1866
02:02:04.88 --> 02:02:07.88
Oh yeah.

1867
02:02:07.88 --> 02:02:11.88
He yells out ammo check.

1868
02:02:11.88 --> 02:02:17.88
And then two nine cylinder radial engine king bees come chugging up the valley tortoise.

1869
02:02:17.88 --> 02:02:25.88
We ignite green smoke marking our position. The NVA ignite identical smoke markers at several locations, confusing the pilots.

1870
02:02:25.88 --> 02:02:27.88
God.

1871
02:02:27.88 --> 02:02:28.88
Oh yeah.

1872
02:02:28.88 --> 02:02:29.88
Bastards.

1873
02:02:29.88 --> 02:02:31.88
And guess what?

1874
02:02:31.88 --> 02:02:36.88
We rise moving toward the approaching ships killing everyone in our path.

1875
02:02:36.88 --> 02:02:37.88
Amos getting critical.

1876
02:02:37.88 --> 02:02:40.88
Each of the team has less than a full magazine.

1877
02:02:40.88 --> 02:02:43.88
And those are 20 round mags.

1878
02:02:43.88 --> 02:02:47.88
Whoever invented the 20 round mag.

1879
02:02:47.88 --> 02:02:50.88
Then set up a 30 round mag.

1880
02:02:50.88 --> 02:02:54.88
The M79 men are down to their last band allures.

1881
02:02:54.88 --> 02:02:58.88
I'm stumbling along working with my browning.

1882
02:02:58.88 --> 02:03:03.88
It's cord peeling the skin off the back of my burn neck.

1883
02:03:03.88 --> 02:03:08.88
We watch and disbelief as this first king be touches down right over an NVA smoke marker,

1884
02:03:08.88 --> 02:03:12.88
taking multiple RPG rocket round hits on the flight deck.

1885
02:03:12.88 --> 02:03:18.88
So just to clarify that so everyone can understand when you're marking for location to get.

1886
02:03:18.88 --> 02:03:21.88
First of all, you got to understand that when you're in a.

1887
02:03:21.88 --> 02:03:25.88
When you're in the sky when you're in a helicopter and you're looking down at the ground,

1888
02:03:25.88 --> 02:03:27.88
it's freaking huge.

1889
02:03:27.88 --> 02:03:28.88
It's massive.

1890
02:03:28.88 --> 02:03:32.88
And I had a time where I was in a training operation.

1891
02:03:32.88 --> 02:03:36.88
And there was a helicopter coming to pick us up and standing there.

1892
02:03:36.88 --> 02:03:39.88
And this was in the desert with your panel.

1893
02:03:39.88 --> 02:03:43.88
And I was standing there with my panel and I'm waving it and I'm like, oh yeah, I'm going right here.

1894
02:03:43.88 --> 02:03:44.88
And he goes where are you?

1895
02:03:44.88 --> 02:03:45.88
And I said I'm right here.

1896
02:03:45.88 --> 02:03:46.88
And he says where are you?

1897
02:03:46.88 --> 02:03:48.88
And I said I'm right freaking here.

1898
02:03:48.88 --> 02:03:52.88
And I'm on the hilltop or whatever stupid thing I said because I was a younger guy.

1899
02:03:52.88 --> 02:03:53.88
Yeah.

1900
02:03:53.88 --> 02:03:54.88
I'm on the hilltop.

1901
02:03:54.88 --> 02:03:56.88
Well, I learned a lesson.

1902
02:03:56.88 --> 02:03:59.88
You know how many hill tops he can see from his helicopter.

1903
02:03:59.88 --> 02:04:01.88
You can see 500 of them.

1904
02:04:01.88 --> 02:04:03.88
So I don't narrow it down at all.

1905
02:04:03.88 --> 02:04:07.88
So what we do is we mark our position with something that's very obvious.

1906
02:04:07.88 --> 02:04:09.88
Like green smoke.

1907
02:04:09.88 --> 02:04:12.88
So in this situation, blackjack gets the green smoke out.

1908
02:04:12.88 --> 02:04:14.88
Hey, come land on this green smoke.

1909
02:04:14.88 --> 02:04:17.88
The the NVAC that.

1910
02:04:17.88 --> 02:04:19.88
And they go, oh, yep, we know what that is.

1911
02:04:19.88 --> 02:04:20.88
Their marked green smoke.

1912
02:04:20.88 --> 02:04:21.88
K-Pull off the green smoke boom.

1913
02:04:21.88 --> 02:04:23.88
So they start throwing green smoke.

1914
02:04:23.88 --> 02:04:24.88
So now what does it look like?

1915
02:04:24.88 --> 02:04:25.88
There's green smoke everywhere.

1916
02:04:25.88 --> 02:04:28.88
Additionally, they were monitoring the radio.

1917
02:04:28.88 --> 02:04:29.88
Oh, yeah.

1918
02:04:29.88 --> 02:04:33.88
So they had RDF as well as the monitoring capabilities.

1919
02:04:33.88 --> 02:04:36.88
And so when they heard, I don't think Lynn would have said green.

1920
02:04:36.88 --> 02:04:38.88
I mean, he probably was going to pop a smoke.

1921
02:04:38.88 --> 02:04:39.88
The NVAC.

1922
02:04:39.88 --> 02:04:41.88
The guest was a good guest.

1923
02:04:41.88 --> 02:04:46.88
And you got to be Zoltz come.

1924
02:04:46.88 --> 02:04:47.88
So here we go.

1925
02:04:47.88 --> 02:04:52.88
We watch in disbelief as the first king be touches down right over an NVAC smoke marker.

1926
02:04:52.88 --> 02:04:55.88
Taking multiple RPG rocket rounds.

1927
02:04:55.88 --> 02:04:57.88
Round hits on its flight deck.

1928
02:04:57.88 --> 02:04:59.88
The force of the blast is so great.

1929
02:04:59.88 --> 02:05:02.88
The ship, teaters and finally topples to its side.

1930
02:05:02.88 --> 02:05:05.88
Each subsequent rotor blade smashing into the ground.

1931
02:05:05.88 --> 02:05:07.88
Wooping in our direction.

1932
02:05:07.88 --> 02:05:10.88
Nerallead missing Alabama as we approach.

1933
02:05:10.88 --> 02:05:12.88
We grab up NVAC weapons.

1934
02:05:12.88 --> 02:05:14.88
Turning them on the enemy.

1935
02:05:14.88 --> 02:05:15.88
They're everywhere.

1936
02:05:15.88 --> 02:05:17.88
Why didn't we see them until now?

1937
02:05:17.88 --> 02:05:20.88
Without hesitation, we charge the rocket position.

1938
02:05:20.88 --> 02:05:25.88
Killing several NVAC before a hail of fire drives us back to our starting point.

1939
02:05:25.88 --> 02:05:28.88
These AKs have a slower rate of cyclic fire.

1940
02:05:28.88 --> 02:05:29.88
cyclic fire.

1941
02:05:29.88 --> 02:05:31.88
The ammunition will last longer.

1942
02:05:31.88 --> 02:05:32.88
We don't need to resupply.

1943
02:05:32.88 --> 02:05:34.88
We can keep doing this till hell freezes over.

1944
02:05:34.88 --> 02:05:36.88
The second.

1945
02:05:36.88 --> 02:05:38.88
So there they ran out of ammo basically.

1946
02:05:38.88 --> 02:05:40.88
Now they're picking up the enemy AK47s.

1947
02:05:40.88 --> 02:05:41.88
And they're shooting.

1948
02:05:41.88 --> 02:05:43.88
And the AK is definitely slower.

1949
02:05:43.88 --> 02:05:45.88
Shooting than a.

1950
02:05:45.88 --> 02:05:46.88
Then a car 15.

1951
02:05:46.88 --> 02:05:50.88
The second ship hits an outcropping of rock on the western side of the no.

1952
02:05:50.88 --> 02:05:54.88
After taking heavy gunfire and falls onto the valley floor below.

1953
02:05:54.88 --> 02:05:55.88
Blackjack.

1954
02:05:55.88 --> 02:05:56.88
Mandolin.

1955
02:05:56.88 --> 02:05:58.88
Nice try over.

1956
02:05:58.88 --> 02:05:59.88
Screw you mandolin.

1957
02:05:59.88 --> 02:06:02.88
I no longer want to be extracted.

1958
02:06:02.88 --> 02:06:07.88
I'm going to kill every one of these sons of mothers before this day ends.

1959
02:06:07.88 --> 02:06:12.88
So there you go.

1960
02:06:12.88 --> 02:06:13.88
I'm going to read that again.

1961
02:06:13.88 --> 02:06:16.88
I no longer want to be extracted.

1962
02:06:16.88 --> 02:06:20.88
I'm going to kill every one of these sons of mothers before this day ends.

1963
02:06:20.88 --> 02:06:24.88
Oh yeah.

1964
02:06:24.88 --> 02:06:26.88
Limbac.

1965
02:06:26.88 --> 02:06:28.88
You don't want to piss off Limbac.

1966
02:06:28.88 --> 02:06:29.88
No.

1967
02:06:29.88 --> 02:06:30.88
No.

1968
02:06:30.88 --> 02:06:35.88
Even on a good day.

1969
02:06:35.88 --> 02:06:40.88
Then cowboy says to the in response to that cowboy who's again.

1970
02:06:40.88 --> 02:06:41.88
This is the interpreter.

1971
02:06:41.88 --> 02:06:42.88
Right.

1972
02:06:42.88 --> 02:06:43.88
He's the interpreter.

1973
02:06:43.88 --> 02:06:44.88
Yes.

1974
02:06:44.88 --> 02:06:45.88
He says one one.

1975
02:06:45.88 --> 02:06:47.88
This is the one one of the guys that's been praying the whole time.

1976
02:06:47.88 --> 02:06:48.88
He says one one.

1977
02:06:48.88 --> 02:06:50.88
Please pray for the team.

1978
02:06:50.88 --> 02:06:51.88
Except Blackjack.

1979
02:06:51.88 --> 02:06:53.88
He's on the devil side now.

1980
02:06:53.88 --> 02:06:57.88
Blackjack.

1981
02:06:57.88 --> 02:07:02.88
Mandolin fast movers have expanded their ordinance and our returning for resupply.

1982
02:07:02.88 --> 02:07:06.88
Your ammo is on that second king be assets in 20 minutes.

1983
02:07:06.88 --> 02:07:07.88
Good luck, brother.

1984
02:07:07.88 --> 02:07:08.88
Mandolin.

1985
02:07:08.88 --> 02:07:09.88
Blackjack.

1986
02:07:09.88 --> 02:07:11.88
We don't need.

1987
02:07:11.88 --> 02:07:12.88
Forget it over.

1988
02:07:12.88 --> 02:07:13.88
Blackjack.

1989
02:07:13.88 --> 02:07:14.88
Mandolin.

1990
02:07:14.88 --> 02:07:15.88
What's your status over?

1991
02:07:15.88 --> 02:07:16.88
Dammit.

1992
02:07:16.88 --> 02:07:17.88
Blackjack.

1993
02:07:17.88 --> 02:07:23.88
Bugles are sounding wave upon wave of NBA troops carrying rifles with fixed bayonets

1994
02:07:23.88 --> 02:07:26.88
is advancing online.

1995
02:07:26.88 --> 02:07:30.88
When they are feet away we open fire using weapons we have taken from their dead.

1996
02:07:30.88 --> 02:07:36.88
After the first burst of full automatic the team fumbles with AK 47 selector switches to single shot,

1997
02:07:36.88 --> 02:07:37.88
pushing them back.

1998
02:07:37.88 --> 02:07:42.88
We move from body to body using their weapons and their cadavers as shields.

1999
02:07:42.88 --> 02:07:46.88
Crawling kneeling, knee walking, standing, scrambling online, inline.

2000
02:07:46.88 --> 02:07:53.88
We defend each other and ourselves without a word, a look, a plan, acting on training, peer survival instinct.

2001
02:07:53.88 --> 02:08:01.88
All of us, except one one are scampering around, dragging, lugging bodies placing them in a circle around Alabama.

2002
02:08:01.88 --> 02:08:08.88
Stacking them high, we construct a cadaver garrison, cowboy is bleeding from a grazing wound to the back of his neck.

2003
02:08:08.88 --> 02:08:17.88
Tiny army-green leeches in inch out of the trampled razor grass, following the blood trails we've created dragging the dead.

2004
02:08:17.88 --> 02:08:28.88
Focusing on details directly in front of me I noticed the vampire mosquitoes and ravenous cannibalistic horse flies competing with the leeches to feed on the dead and wounded and on the living.

2005
02:08:28.88 --> 02:08:34.88
One of the Vietnamese flips me a plastic mosquito repellent bottle.

2006
02:08:34.88 --> 02:08:38.88
Hey, that's stings. What the hell are we doing worrying about mosquitoes when people are trying to kill us?

2007
02:08:38.88 --> 02:08:43.88
Snaggis is much animal, ammo is possible, I order.

2008
02:08:43.88 --> 02:08:51.88
Back and forth and again, it's important to remember that this is Lynn telling the story. He's debriefing.

2009
02:08:51.88 --> 02:08:56.88
In the way it's laid out, you can tell that he's debriefing in the book. I'm probably not doing a great job, but this is during the debrief.

2010
02:08:56.88 --> 02:09:03.88
And what's interesting, all these things that he's saying about the one one, the one one is in the debrief with him.

2011
02:09:03.88 --> 02:09:08.88
He's saying like, oh, he's not doing anything and one one's in there.

2012
02:09:08.88 --> 02:09:17.88
And he just kind of goes into it a little bit, but he's kind of a verdict his eye and he's keeping his head down. Like, you know, he knows he didn't do a good job.

2013
02:09:17.88 --> 02:09:27.88
Back and forth between the NVA and recon team Alabama continues the back and forth between the NVA and the recon team Alabama continues on and on and on.

2014
02:09:27.88 --> 02:09:32.88
They just keep coming. I don't know how much longer we can keep them keep this up. Keep them off us.

2015
02:09:32.88 --> 02:09:42.88
The matted grass is saturated with slimy slippery blood and human innards smoke, cordite and the stench of death, choke us as foul weather closes in.

2016
02:09:42.88 --> 02:09:50.88
Mosquitoes, horse flies and the enemy are all conspiring to nibble us to death to swallow us whole. Soon air support will be possible.

2017
02:09:50.88 --> 02:09:56.88
Slowly, I come to the realization that I have no physical strength left and I can barely move. I can't let my team down.

2018
02:09:56.88 --> 02:10:06.88
One of the team slips and slides on the stomachs over the cadaver garrison to retrieve ammo while other members of the team provide covering fire.

2019
02:10:06.88 --> 02:10:16.88
So these guys are in a freaking small little fort that they've constructed with enemy bodies.

2020
02:10:16.88 --> 02:10:20.88
And when someone goes outside of that perimeter, they've constructed a perimeter.

2021
02:10:20.88 --> 02:10:28.88
When someone goes outside that perimeter from the team to go gather ammo, the other guys are laying down fire to protect that guy.

2022
02:10:28.88 --> 02:10:32.88
Yeah, he has another thing too with that team.

2023
02:10:32.88 --> 02:10:40.88
They had another one zero on the team prior to stride being assigned to it and they worked really hard on their team.

2024
02:10:40.88 --> 02:10:56.88
Birds the reaction drills. And what they're doing there, I think someone that goes back to the training, that one zero is Tim Shaw. He really worked the team hard as a good one zero, but stride for reasons known only to the command.

2025
02:10:56.88 --> 02:11:00.88
They pulled Tim off and put stride in charge because he had more rank.

2026
02:11:00.88 --> 02:11:08.88
But that team right there, that moment in time when the team's doing it went out together, that's all that training that they had prior.

2027
02:11:08.88 --> 02:11:14.88
An experience, Calboy, his year's lock, of course Lynn from the herd.

2028
02:11:14.88 --> 02:11:24.88
Blackjack, Mandolin, Jolly Greens 10 minutes out. Get ready to go home over.

2029
02:11:24.88 --> 02:11:36.88
That announcement lifts a thousand pounds sandbag off my shoulders. We're going home. Mandolin, Blackjack, do you have any idea what size of the force is over?

2030
02:11:36.88 --> 02:11:42.88
Blackjack Mandolin, what you're up against is the regiment you are sent to track over.

2031
02:11:42.88 --> 02:11:48.88
Is that all? Only 3,000 of the bastards? Well, I think we made an indent. I think we made a dent in them.

2032
02:11:48.88 --> 02:11:56.88
Don't you just barely brother, Bugle sound. The sky is filled with grenades. We're hugging the ground as if as they explode around us.

2033
02:11:56.88 --> 02:12:08.88
And it's, till tell us a little bit about the fact that the enemy, they don't have radios. So what they use is whistles and bugles to coordinate their attacks.

2034
02:12:08.88 --> 02:12:16.88
Yeah, the command levels have some radios. And the command gets to their command. Like if you break it down for a patoon to squaw leaders.

2035
02:12:16.88 --> 02:12:28.88
And then with the bugles and the commands, they're trained how they are attacked with withdrawal. And that's what then came up against over and over again.

2036
02:12:28.88 --> 02:12:42.88
Yeah, they, in the Korean War, all those times when that's like the most horrifying thing is all those times when they were to get these human assaults, human wave assaults towards their positions.

2037
02:12:42.88 --> 02:12:47.88
It was all whistles. They'd hear the whistles and they'd hear the bugles. And they would know what was about to happen.

2038
02:12:47.88 --> 02:12:51.88
Sometimes it's for siph, just to make the noise every time you heard you know they're coming.

2039
02:12:51.88 --> 02:13:02.88
Bugle sound. The sky is filled with grenades. We're hugging the ground as they explode around us. Hey, these aren't fragmentation. They're concussion. Just a bunch of noise.

2040
02:13:02.88 --> 02:13:15.88
Not sending out much trappin'o. Conclusion stuff, stuff like the ones they used on me earlier. You're mine now, you bastards. You stand back up, catching some, and begin throwing them immediately back.

2041
02:13:15.88 --> 02:13:19.88
You should have seen the look on their faces. Oh crap, here they come.

2042
02:13:19.88 --> 02:13:24.88
Wouldn't grenade trappin'o sever the prick 25 radio antenna.

2043
02:13:24.88 --> 02:13:38.88
I begin to rig an impromptu long wire aerial with the intention of laying it over the cliff behind us out of harm's way. Relentless, the NVA continued their advance alongside the leeches mosquitoes and horse flies inch by bloody inch.

2044
02:13:38.88 --> 02:13:47.88
Too hoi, surrender, I yell at no one in particular. Mandolin blackjack, a large force is now yards away from our perimeter. We need help.

2045
02:13:47.88 --> 02:14:04.88
Too hoi, hog, attack helicopters, rotor chop their way into the LZ. First with the M60 chatter followed up by the wash of rockets placed into the NVA ranks. Blackjack, judge, over, go judge.

2046
02:14:04.88 --> 02:14:09.88
And this judge is one of the call signs for the Marine Corps. The Marine Corps.

2047
02:14:09.88 --> 02:14:17.88
But this is the muskets. Oh, judge in the executioner. Okay. Yeah, so these are army units that came out of a Merrick-Cal.

2048
02:14:17.88 --> 02:14:24.88
Oh, yes, scar faces that scar faces are Marine Corps. So what kind of aircraft are there is judge in executioner same thing?

2049
02:14:24.88 --> 02:14:32.88
Oh, so there are also cobras. No, no cobras at this time. All the gunships were old to you, they could barely go off the ground.

2050
02:14:32.88 --> 02:14:43.88
God, in fact, they're so weighted down without them. And they didn't have the power that the leader models had. In fact, a lot of times when they took off the door guns, we get out to try to lift the helicopter, get it moving.

2051
02:14:43.88 --> 02:14:47.88
And once they got a little forward momentum, they jumped back in the helicopter.

2052
02:14:47.88 --> 02:15:01.88
And the muskets even put little wheels in the front of the skids, so that when they're on asphalt, they could be able to move better without having to skid behind. They figured the wheel would roll better, and they'd gun as about to push in these things.

2053
02:15:01.88 --> 02:15:04.88
That's like Fred Flintstone situation trying to get that.

2054
02:15:04.88 --> 02:15:08.88
Right, so here's a sidebar on one of these on the muskets.

2055
02:15:08.88 --> 02:15:20.88
There was a guy, his name was Berg and Berg, this is his very first mission with the muskets on Prairie Fire for a sawed mission.

2056
02:15:20.88 --> 02:15:22.88
Welcome to sawed.

2057
02:15:22.88 --> 02:15:22.88
Welcome to sawed.

2058
02:15:22.88 --> 02:15:24.88
His first mission as a door gunner.

2059
02:15:24.88 --> 02:15:29.88
Yeah, these are two, these are some epic call signs, though, judge and executioner.

2060
02:15:29.88 --> 02:15:31.88
Oh yeah.

2061
02:15:31.88 --> 02:15:37.88
So, judge checks in on the radio, and this is just such a, you know, as a calm guy.

2062
02:15:37.88 --> 02:15:42.88
So when you get that aircraft checking in, it's like the best feeling of the world, and he comes up blackjack judge over.

2063
02:15:42.88 --> 02:15:48.88
And the pilots are always a little bit more, you know, just sort of really smooth on the radio.

2064
02:15:48.88 --> 02:15:52.88
And so he's coming in this totally hot situation, blackjack judge over.

2065
02:15:52.88 --> 02:15:57.88
And he says, go judge, anyone particular or just kill him all?

2066
02:15:57.88 --> 02:15:58.88
He's laughing.

2067
02:15:58.88 --> 02:16:04.88
Grieve some all, I say, with malevolent bloody grimmace, you're just in time for the party.

2068
02:16:04.88 --> 02:16:08.88
Judges, door gunners are working their M60s in long bursts.

2069
02:16:08.88 --> 02:16:10.88
My guns are going on meltdown.

2070
02:16:10.88 --> 02:16:12.88
Executioners right behind me.

2071
02:16:12.88 --> 02:16:19.88
The NVA back off a few moments, briefly licking their wounds far from discouraged new assault lines form.

2072
02:16:19.88 --> 02:16:23.88
Before they can open fire on us, executioner confronts them head on.

2073
02:16:23.88 --> 02:16:25.88
Both door gunners blazing away.

2074
02:16:25.88 --> 02:16:30.88
He is hovering inches off the LZ, skipping rockets off the ground into their ranks.

2075
02:16:30.88 --> 02:16:34.88
Executioner lifts up his rotors chopping loudly at the missed field air.

2076
02:16:34.88 --> 02:16:40.88
They make it over the tree line ducking down to the basin below remaining below anti aircraft capability.

2077
02:16:40.88 --> 02:16:46.88
Regaining air speed as they come up the executioner and is crew returning for another pass to protect our perimeter.

2078
02:16:46.88 --> 02:16:49.88
The NVA charge before we can celebrate fire fire.

2079
02:16:49.88 --> 02:16:50.88
We add more.

2080
02:16:50.88 --> 02:16:54.88
We add more of them to the cadavered dearest and along with the

2081
02:16:54.88 --> 02:16:57.88
weapons and much needed ammo.

2082
02:16:57.88 --> 02:17:02.88
Silence, no birds chirping, no voices, mosquitoes, flies, no sounds none.

2083
02:17:02.88 --> 02:17:08.88
Even the aircraft have flown far enough away that their absence amplifies the quiet after an almost continuous.

2084
02:17:08.88 --> 02:17:12.88
May lay of gunfire grenades and claymore explosions.

2085
02:17:12.88 --> 02:17:18.88
Air ordinance expenditures including cluster bomb units, Nae palm and gun runs in 20 millimeter cannons.

2086
02:17:18.88 --> 02:17:21.88
Silence, have I gone deaf?

2087
02:17:21.88 --> 02:17:24.88
Completely silence.

2088
02:17:24.88 --> 02:17:25.88
You've been here.

2089
02:17:25.88 --> 02:17:27.88
Yeah, that's freaking crazy.

2090
02:17:27.88 --> 02:17:28.88
Yeah.

2091
02:17:28.88 --> 02:17:31.88
In dead rest each of us lays motionless.

2092
02:17:31.88 --> 02:17:36.88
And by the way, when you say I've been there, no, I have not been in a freaking

2093
02:17:36.88 --> 02:17:37.88
cadavered.

2094
02:17:37.88 --> 02:17:39.88
It's not changing mags.

2095
02:17:39.88 --> 02:17:41.88
Yeah, there's a little mag change going on.

2096
02:17:41.88 --> 02:17:47.88
Each of us rests in dead rest each of us lays motionless, barely breathing.

2097
02:17:47.88 --> 02:17:51.88
My mind is focused inward unaware of its physical surrounding.

2098
02:17:51.88 --> 02:17:53.88
Mind and body are not one.

2099
02:17:53.88 --> 02:17:56.88
One one continues to quietly chant his prayer.

2100
02:17:56.88 --> 02:18:01.88
Cowboy has taken another hit during the last skirmish along with two of the others.

2101
02:18:01.88 --> 02:18:03.88
Come back, think, move.

2102
02:18:03.88 --> 02:18:06.88
Summing energy from where I don't know.

2103
02:18:06.88 --> 02:18:09.88
I fumble around in my medical gear.

2104
02:18:09.88 --> 02:18:13.88
I'm giving you a more feeling will apply a compress to that wound.

2105
02:18:13.88 --> 02:18:16.88
We're going to run out of bandages if you keep getting shot.

2106
02:18:16.88 --> 02:18:18.88
Knock it off, okay?

2107
02:18:18.88 --> 02:18:20.88
So Cowboys been hit a couple times.

2108
02:18:20.88 --> 02:18:21.88
Oh, more than that.

2109
02:18:21.88 --> 02:18:22.88
It looks like four or five.

2110
02:18:22.88 --> 02:18:23.88
I lost count.

2111
02:18:23.88 --> 02:18:28.88
And so, Lynn tells me to run out of bandages so, quick and shot.

2112
02:18:28.88 --> 02:18:32.88
And then Cowboys says, we're John Wayne when you need him.

2113
02:18:32.88 --> 02:18:36.88
Alabama laughs as an NVA, boisterously yells,

2114
02:18:36.88 --> 02:18:38.88
Chuhoy, Dumah.

2115
02:18:38.88 --> 02:18:41.88
Another NVA orders us to Chuhoy in English.

2116
02:18:41.88 --> 02:18:47.88
I flip him the bird as a sniper shoots, Kwang, our tail gunner in the crotch.

2117
02:18:47.88 --> 02:18:52.88
I flip my borrowed AK on Fulato and unloaded into a tree about a hundred yards away,

2118
02:18:52.88 --> 02:18:55.88
resulting in the sniper falling through his limbs through its limbs,

2119
02:18:55.88 --> 02:18:58.88
and brush below to the ground with a foot.

2120
02:18:58.88 --> 02:19:01.88
If I could rip your heart out needed, I would.

2121
02:19:01.88 --> 02:19:04.88
Kwang, Kwang, what have we done?

2122
02:19:04.88 --> 02:19:07.88
Last week, you got arrested by National Police in a way,

2123
02:19:07.88 --> 02:19:10.88
in a way, whorehouse for carrying a pistol.

2124
02:19:10.88 --> 02:19:14.88
The entire Alabama team put on their gear and went down and broke you out of jail,

2125
02:19:14.88 --> 02:19:16.88
so you could go on this mission.

2126
02:19:16.88 --> 02:19:19.88
God damn it, I wish we'd left you in that place where you'd be safe right now.

2127
02:19:19.88 --> 02:19:23.88
Hahahaha.

2128
02:19:23.88 --> 02:19:26.88
Look, I was calling him, look, sorry, lock.

2129
02:19:26.88 --> 02:19:30.88
Lock is applying to pressure to Kwang, the tail gunner's wound.

2130
02:19:30.88 --> 02:19:35.88
Seconds later, an AE1, A1E, Skyrader, Lumbers into the AO,

2131
02:19:35.88 --> 02:19:38.88
flown by a pilot codenamed Snoopy.

2132
02:19:38.88 --> 02:19:42.88
It roars in from the west, brushing tree tops, full flaps,

2133
02:19:42.88 --> 02:19:44.88
working the throttle.

2134
02:19:44.88 --> 02:19:47.88
The aircraft is so close to the team we can hear the distinctive

2135
02:19:47.88 --> 02:19:50.88
metallic click-click of the Nae Palm canister being released

2136
02:19:50.88 --> 02:19:52.88
from the second World War A1E.

2137
02:19:52.88 --> 02:19:55.88
The Skyrader appears to be falling,

2138
02:19:55.88 --> 02:19:58.88
but actually it slips down into the valley to escape gunfire

2139
02:19:58.88 --> 02:20:02.88
as helicopters and fast movers have maneuvered earlier.

2140
02:20:02.88 --> 02:20:05.88
His wingman royals through the clouds and core night,

2141
02:20:05.88 --> 02:20:08.88
we can hear nuts, bolts, and god knows what,

2142
02:20:08.88 --> 02:20:11.88
creaking, groaning as he solves his ship's rockets.

2143
02:20:11.88 --> 02:20:14.88
Three NVA mortars open fire,

2144
02:20:14.88 --> 02:20:17.88
Dup, Dup, boom, Dup, boom, boom,

2145
02:20:17.88 --> 02:20:20.88
they're long, the rounds fall into the valley at our rear.

2146
02:20:20.88 --> 02:20:23.88
There's no way in how many of us can catch mortars

2147
02:20:23.88 --> 02:20:24.88
and throw them back.

2148
02:20:24.88 --> 02:20:26.88
Time to go back to work, I order.

2149
02:20:26.88 --> 02:20:29.88
Lock and I slide over the cadaver wall,

2150
02:20:29.88 --> 02:20:31.88
crouching, crawling, knee-walking,

2151
02:20:31.88 --> 02:20:33.88
we move towards the mortars,

2152
02:20:33.88 --> 02:20:36.88
cautiously picking our way through the charred bodies

2153
02:20:36.88 --> 02:20:38.88
from previous airborne assaults.

2154
02:20:38.88 --> 02:20:41.88
Quietly, yeah, right, we travel into the jungle

2155
02:20:41.88 --> 02:20:44.88
within a few yards in the first mortar tube.

2156
02:20:44.88 --> 02:20:47.88
Lock stops me to draw a plan to the dirt.

2157
02:20:47.88 --> 02:20:49.88
He will hit one tube, tube, I will take tube,

2158
02:20:49.88 --> 02:20:51.88
three, and we will combine on tube, tube, tube,

2159
02:20:51.88 --> 02:20:54.88
damn suicide mission, I say under my breath.

2160
02:20:54.88 --> 02:20:56.88
Lock nods at me.

2161
02:20:56.88 --> 02:21:00.88
Keep Roy, he replies, we die.

2162
02:21:00.88 --> 02:21:02.88
After the mortar, after the mortar men launched

2163
02:21:02.88 --> 02:21:04.88
the next set of three-salvos,

2164
02:21:04.88 --> 02:21:06.88
lock opens fire on his target wall,

2165
02:21:06.88 --> 02:21:10.88
attack, tube, three, discovering several nearby infantry.

2166
02:21:10.88 --> 02:21:12.88
God, so he's in the middle of all this freaking crap,

2167
02:21:12.88 --> 02:21:14.88
and then they're going out and assaulting these three

2168
02:21:14.88 --> 02:21:15.88
mortar positions.

2169
02:21:15.88 --> 02:21:18.88
Yeah, which God knows how far they had to be at least

2170
02:21:18.88 --> 02:21:19.88
what 100 yards away.

2171
02:21:19.88 --> 02:21:23.88
At least, they were told a football field.

2172
02:21:23.88 --> 02:21:27.88
And there's a subsperion for tree trying to kill him

2173
02:21:27.88 --> 02:21:28.88
in between.

2174
02:21:28.88 --> 02:21:33.88
And those are some motivational words.

2175
02:21:33.88 --> 02:21:36.88
We die, and that's sort of like, fuck it, let's go.

2176
02:21:36.88 --> 02:21:37.88
Yeah, let's do this.

2177
02:21:37.88 --> 02:21:39.88
He was a tiger.

2178
02:21:39.88 --> 02:21:43.88
Oh crap, there are more of these bastards than I thought.

2179
02:21:43.88 --> 02:21:47.88
I begin moving low and fast as the survivors chase me,

2180
02:21:47.88 --> 02:21:49.88
heading toward two-one where lock is pinned down,

2181
02:21:49.88 --> 02:21:51.88
yelling as loud as possible,

2182
02:21:51.88 --> 02:21:53.88
drawing their attention, allowing lock to move out of the kilzone.

2183
02:21:53.88 --> 02:21:56.88
I roll our last fragmentation grenade into their midst,

2184
02:21:56.88 --> 02:21:59.88
killing several wounding the rest, lock and eye attack the second two,

2185
02:21:59.88 --> 02:22:02.88
before returning to the team, picking ammo from the dead.

2186
02:22:02.88 --> 02:22:07.88
Snipers dog us all the way back to our cadaver garrison.

2187
02:22:07.88 --> 02:22:10.88
The two of us press our bloody bodies against the jungle floor

2188
02:22:10.88 --> 02:22:13.88
as green tracers search the air around us.

2189
02:22:13.88 --> 02:22:17.88
One one, take a look at this, I say, while rolling over.

2190
02:22:17.88 --> 02:22:20.88
The blood and dirt on me are forming a second skin.

2191
02:22:20.88 --> 02:22:23.88
Leaves and grasses have begun to stick to my bare skin,

2192
02:22:23.88 --> 02:22:27.88
and ants and beetle seem to be making a home on my new crust.

2193
02:22:27.88 --> 02:22:29.88
I'm building my own camouflage.

2194
02:22:29.88 --> 02:22:31.88
It looks like I'm becoming part of this place.

2195
02:22:31.88 --> 02:22:34.88
If I lay down, I bet you they won't tell me from the dead.

2196
02:22:34.88 --> 02:22:36.88
Oh God, please don't go crazy.

2197
02:22:36.88 --> 02:22:37.88
You gotta get us out of here.

2198
02:22:37.88 --> 02:22:39.88
I want to go home, please.

2199
02:22:39.88 --> 02:22:42.88
We'll all be dead long before I go crazy.

2200
02:22:42.88 --> 02:22:46.88
Through the clouds and haze the battle weeklamps of Jolly Green.

2201
02:22:46.88 --> 02:22:51.88
JG28, starting its descent into the LZ.

2202
02:22:51.88 --> 02:22:54.88
As it approaches the radio crackles, blackjack.

2203
02:22:54.88 --> 02:22:59.88
This is 28 on short final looking for an orange panel on the southeast side of the LZ.

2204
02:22:59.88 --> 02:23:00.88
Over.

2205
02:23:02.88 --> 02:23:05.88
28 blackjack panels on the ground.

2206
02:23:05.88 --> 02:23:08.88
We'll attempt to suppress enemy fire for your landing.

2207
02:23:08.88 --> 02:23:12.88
Orange panel insight, adjusting approach, preparing for touchdown blackjack.

2208
02:23:12.88 --> 02:23:14.88
Get your people on board, over.

2209
02:23:14.88 --> 02:23:17.88
Negative, negative, not southeast, we're southwest.

2210
02:23:17.88 --> 02:23:19.88
You're in the wrong place. Get out of there.

2211
02:23:19.88 --> 02:23:24.88
The NVA raise up all around JG28 firing everything they have.

2212
02:23:24.88 --> 02:23:27.88
The pilot keys isn't radio to answer back.

2213
02:23:27.88 --> 02:23:30.88
I hear a crew member in the background, calm yelling.

2214
02:23:30.88 --> 02:23:32.88
We have fuel leak.

2215
02:23:32.88 --> 02:23:33.88
It's everywhere.

2216
02:23:33.88 --> 02:23:34.88
Get us out of here.

2217
02:23:34.88 --> 02:23:37.88
We watch as the glass and the cockpit on the co-pilot side.

2218
02:23:37.88 --> 02:23:40.88
Disappears with successive rocket explosions.

2219
02:23:40.88 --> 02:23:45.88
The pilot struggles to lift wall, lift off while maintaining control of his ship.

2220
02:23:45.88 --> 02:23:46.88
28 is up.

2221
02:23:46.88 --> 02:23:47.88
28 is up.

2222
02:23:47.88 --> 02:23:54.88
Our ride home is slipping sideways across the LZ passing within touching distance above us.

2223
02:23:54.88 --> 02:23:59.88
Over the lip of the plateau down into the valley to escape the relentless enemy barrage.

2224
02:23:59.88 --> 02:24:04.88
Alabama goes insane on full auto burning up the majority of our ammo on anything that moves.

2225
02:24:04.88 --> 02:24:06.88
One one praise.

2226
02:24:06.88 --> 02:24:07.88
Snooping is wingman.

2227
02:24:07.88 --> 02:24:12.88
Move into the next move in next to the crippled JG28.

2228
02:24:12.88 --> 02:24:18.88
Through the haze and darkening storm clouds,

2229
02:24:18.88 --> 02:24:23.88
Kavi is attempting to direct gunships across the LZ to pick off targets of opportunity.

2230
02:24:23.88 --> 02:24:28.88
Their rotors are moving smoke and clouds down across our cadaver's tuned landscape.

2231
02:24:28.88 --> 02:24:29.88
Obscuring everyone's view.

2232
02:24:29.88 --> 02:24:30.88
28 blackjack.

2233
02:24:30.88 --> 02:24:31.88
28 blackjack.

2234
02:24:31.88 --> 02:24:32.88
Are you guys okay?

2235
02:24:32.88 --> 02:24:33.88
Over.

2236
02:24:33.88 --> 02:24:34.88
Blackjack.

2237
02:24:34.88 --> 02:24:36.88
We have a severed fuel line.

2238
02:24:36.88 --> 02:24:38.88
The stuff sloshing all over the deck.

2239
02:24:38.88 --> 02:24:40.88
Fuel fumes are blinding my crew.

2240
02:24:40.88 --> 02:24:43.88
We can't fire our guns without going up and flames.

2241
02:24:43.88 --> 02:24:45.88
Snooping will escort us out of here.

2242
02:24:45.88 --> 02:24:46.88
Good luck, Blackjack.

2243
02:24:46.88 --> 02:24:47.88
Out.

2244
02:24:55.88 --> 02:25:00.88
Green tracer shift from horizontal grazing fire across the LZ to vertical.

2245
02:25:00.88 --> 02:25:03.88
As Jolly Green giant 10 approaches,

2246
02:25:03.88 --> 02:25:07.88
the green furries playing a deafening tune through its skin.

2247
02:25:07.88 --> 02:25:10.88
JG10, blackjack.

2248
02:25:10.88 --> 02:25:12.88
The enemy is under you right now.

2249
02:25:12.88 --> 02:25:13.88
Over.

2250
02:25:13.88 --> 02:25:18.88
From our position we can see an NVA rocket crew rise up in the grass.

2251
02:25:18.88 --> 02:25:22.88
Take aim and fire directly into the underbelly of JG10.

2252
02:25:22.88 --> 02:25:23.88
We're hit.

2253
02:25:23.88 --> 02:25:25.88
We have a six inch hole through the floor.

2254
02:25:25.88 --> 02:25:27.88
Both engine warning lights just came on.

2255
02:25:27.88 --> 02:25:29.88
We can't make the pickup.

2256
02:25:29.88 --> 02:25:30.88
Oh my god.

2257
02:25:30.88 --> 02:25:31.88
Look at that.

2258
02:25:31.88 --> 02:25:32.88
Both engines are on fire.

2259
02:25:32.88 --> 02:25:34.88
The pilot performs a 180 degree turn.

2260
02:25:34.88 --> 02:25:37.88
Moving the damage to aircraft away from the enemy fire.

2261
02:25:37.88 --> 02:25:39.88
Away from Alabama.

2262
02:25:39.88 --> 02:25:42.88
We can see him struggling to keep his board bird airborne.

2263
02:25:42.88 --> 02:25:46.88
As his crew continues firing, time is run out.

2264
02:25:46.88 --> 02:25:51.88
Traveling several hundred yards the pilot comes up on his survival frequency.

2265
02:25:51.88 --> 02:25:52.88
Brace for crash landing.

2266
02:25:52.88 --> 02:25:55.88
They continue firing while the burning ship settles into the jungle.

2267
02:25:55.88 --> 02:25:56.88
Blackjack.

2268
02:25:56.88 --> 02:25:57.88
Mandolin over.

2269
02:25:57.88 --> 02:25:58.88
Go Mandolin.

2270
02:25:58.88 --> 02:26:00.88
First you won the lottery.

2271
02:26:00.88 --> 02:26:02.88
Then you maneuver your way into a prairie fire.

2272
02:26:02.88 --> 02:26:04.88
And now for the bonus round.

2273
02:26:04.88 --> 02:26:06.88
SIGON has ordered an arc light.

2274
02:26:06.88 --> 02:26:07.88
Over.

2275
02:26:07.88 --> 02:26:09.88
Bonus round.

2276
02:26:09.88 --> 02:26:10.88
What do they think this is?

2277
02:26:10.88 --> 02:26:11.88
The prices right.

2278
02:26:11.88 --> 02:26:13.88
There's no way we can survive an arc light.

2279
02:26:13.88 --> 02:26:14.88
Tell us at the NVA.

2280
02:26:14.88 --> 02:26:16.88
Maybe they'll run like hell and leave us be.

2281
02:26:16.88 --> 02:26:18.88
What altitude will they be bombing from?

2282
02:26:18.88 --> 02:26:23.88
They'll be cruising at 25,000 feet for a standard carpet bombing mission.

2283
02:26:23.88 --> 02:26:25.88
Not exactly accurate from that altitude.

2284
02:26:25.88 --> 02:26:30.88
SIGON is assuming you won't be there or be alive by the time to be 52's.

2285
02:26:30.88 --> 02:26:32.88
Get here over.

2286
02:26:32.88 --> 02:26:33.88
Damn straight.

2287
02:26:33.88 --> 02:26:35.88
I have to get back to camp for recon.

2288
02:26:35.88 --> 02:26:37.88
Comprehensible ballgame this evening.

2289
02:26:37.88 --> 02:26:40.88
How long do we have over?

2290
02:26:40.88 --> 02:26:43.88
One of the indages outside the garrison stealing it.

2291
02:26:43.88 --> 02:26:46.88
Stealing AK47 magazines from the dead.

2292
02:26:46.88 --> 02:26:49.88
He's tossing them into our garrison as the rest of us return fire.

2293
02:26:49.88 --> 02:26:50.88
Blackjack.

2294
02:26:50.88 --> 02:26:51.88
Mandolin.

2295
02:26:51.88 --> 02:26:54.88
The arc light is off the runway and heading your way over.

2296
02:26:54.88 --> 02:26:55.88
So what tells about a.

2297
02:26:55.88 --> 02:26:57.88
Tell us about an arc light.

2298
02:26:57.88 --> 02:27:00.88
B 52.

2299
02:27:00.88 --> 02:27:05.88
And what the their load is like over 20,000 pounds of bombs.

2300
02:27:05.88 --> 02:27:08.88
And they've become more than one.

2301
02:27:08.88 --> 02:27:10.88
And you don't hear them.

2302
02:27:10.88 --> 02:27:13.88
As you know, you don't hear anything until the first round impacts.

2303
02:27:13.88 --> 02:27:16.88
And that was the code for an arc light.

2304
02:27:16.88 --> 02:27:19.88
And the amazing firepower.

2305
02:27:19.88 --> 02:27:22.88
And they're going to basically carpet bomb this area.

2306
02:27:22.88 --> 02:27:23.88
Right.

2307
02:27:23.88 --> 02:27:24.88
That's the plan.

2308
02:27:24.88 --> 02:27:26.88
What is carpet bomb?

2309
02:27:26.88 --> 02:27:29.88
Do bombs every like, yeah, just lay down.

2310
02:27:29.88 --> 02:27:38.88
I mean, I don't know how many aircraft there are in this particular mission, but it's a probably multiple aircraft with all those bombs.

2311
02:27:38.88 --> 02:27:40.88
And they get over the location.

2312
02:27:40.88 --> 02:27:46.88
And they just open their bomb a deer doors and out come the other their bay doors and out come the bombs.

2313
02:27:46.88 --> 02:27:51.88
You know, when you see pictures or videos, where there's just all these airplanes find there's just bomb.

2314
02:27:51.88 --> 02:27:53.88
Yeah, that's leaking out.

2315
02:27:53.88 --> 02:27:54.88
Just leaking out.

2316
02:27:54.88 --> 02:27:56.88
That's supposed to direct support.

2317
02:27:56.88 --> 02:27:58.88
We're coming in one or two bombs around the scene.

2318
02:27:58.88 --> 02:27:59.88
This is like every like,

2319
02:27:59.88 --> 02:28:06.88
Jocco saying, you may have four or five planes and they fly over everything's all bombs are dropped.

2320
02:28:06.88 --> 02:28:08.88
Carp over 100.

2321
02:28:08.88 --> 02:28:12.88
At least, yeah, they'll be in reverse of 250,500,000 dollars.

2322
02:28:18.88 --> 02:28:20.88
Blackjack, mandolin.

2323
02:28:20.88 --> 02:28:22.88
I don't think I want to be here.

2324
02:28:22.88 --> 02:28:26.88
When they arrive over Blackjack, mandolin, well, you have one last option over.

2325
02:28:26.88 --> 02:28:28.88
What is it over unexpectedly?

2326
02:28:28.88 --> 02:28:32.88
Are radio frequencies flooded with fast talking Vietnamese cat?

2327
02:28:32.88 --> 02:28:33.88
Yeah.

2328
02:28:33.88 --> 02:28:34.88
You can't get a break.

2329
02:28:34.88 --> 02:28:38.88
So the Vietnamese figure out what radio frequency they are on they start using that.

2330
02:28:38.88 --> 02:28:43.88
Unexpectedly, are radio frequencies flooded with fast talking Vietnamese cowboy lessons for a few seconds.

2331
02:28:43.88 --> 02:28:45.88
It says, NVA find our frequency.

2332
02:28:45.88 --> 02:28:48.88
I switch to an alternate frequency as it is jammed.

2333
02:28:48.88 --> 02:28:53.88
NVA find our frequency. I switch to an alternate frequency as it is jammed and it is jammed as well.

2334
02:28:53.88 --> 02:28:59.88
I throw the PRC radio over the cliff and switch to the URC 10 survival radio.

2335
02:28:59.88 --> 02:29:05.88
Mandolin, Blackjack over mandolin, Blackjack over Blackjack, JG32 over.

2336
02:29:05.88 --> 02:29:07.88
Go, JG32.

2337
02:29:07.88 --> 02:29:13.88
You're on an Air Force survival guard frequency 243.

2338
02:29:13.88 --> 02:29:18.88
Kovie 265 is busy on other channels. We'll get his attention for you.

2339
02:29:18.88 --> 02:29:23.88
I'm hovering in a draw to your west. We have 20 minutes of fuel left before I leave.

2340
02:29:23.88 --> 02:29:26.88
The first person we see better be an American.

2341
02:29:26.88 --> 02:29:27.88
Hurry.

2342
02:29:27.88 --> 02:29:29.88
We're taking heavy ground fire.

2343
02:29:29.88 --> 02:29:33.88
Our armor is not holding up this close to the source.

2344
02:29:33.88 --> 02:29:35.88
JG32, can you hook me up with Kovie?

2345
02:29:35.88 --> 02:29:38.88
Blackjack, mandolin over.

2346
02:29:38.88 --> 02:29:42.88
Mandolin, can you lay down covering fire between awesome JG32?

2347
02:29:42.88 --> 02:29:45.88
Give me two minutes to line up assets and then move out.

2348
02:29:45.88 --> 02:29:46.88
We're getting empty.

2349
02:29:46.88 --> 02:29:50.88
The next voice you hear will be spiders over.

2350
02:29:50.88 --> 02:29:53.88
Roger Spider, Blackjack over.

2351
02:29:53.88 --> 02:29:55.88
I turn yell at the team.

2352
02:29:55.88 --> 02:29:58.88
Alabama discard everything we don't need over the side.

2353
02:29:58.88 --> 02:30:00.88
Get ready to move out.

2354
02:30:00.88 --> 02:30:02.88
Cowboy and I move to the edge of the cliff.

2355
02:30:02.88 --> 02:30:05.88
While locked demands commands the garrison.

2356
02:30:05.88 --> 02:30:08.88
The two of us cautiously peep over the edge.

2357
02:30:08.88 --> 02:30:12.88
15 feet below us is a ledge that moves in the direction we want to travel.

2358
02:30:12.88 --> 02:30:15.88
Move the team to this location, I order.

2359
02:30:15.88 --> 02:30:17.88
Cowboy crawls back to the connevered garrison.

2360
02:30:17.88 --> 02:30:20.88
While I make another attempt at contacting Spider.

2361
02:30:20.88 --> 02:30:23.88
One at a time, Alabama comes crawling over to me.

2362
02:30:23.88 --> 02:30:25.88
I begin lowering each of them to the ledge below.

2363
02:30:25.88 --> 02:30:29.88
One one scales the rock face, making his own way out.

2364
02:30:29.88 --> 02:30:30.88
Making his own way.

2365
02:30:30.88 --> 02:30:35.88
Immediately beginning to move along the ledge in the direction of JG32.

2366
02:30:35.88 --> 02:30:37.88
Cowboy, stop him.

2367
02:30:37.88 --> 02:30:41.88
From the ledge we look up the face of the cliff.

2368
02:30:41.88 --> 02:30:45.88
We can see tracer dancing across the lip of the rim.

2369
02:30:45.88 --> 02:30:50.88
Covey's directing Daisy Chain air strikes between Alabama and JG32.

2370
02:30:50.88 --> 02:30:56.88
Blackjack Spider, we're dropping cluster bomb units CBU on the path between you and JG32.

2371
02:30:56.88 --> 02:31:01.88
It will kill some and should temporarily drive the rest out of the zone.

2372
02:31:01.88 --> 02:31:03.88
Man.

2373
02:31:03.88 --> 02:31:09.88
So they want to get to where this helicopter is located flying in this little draw.

2374
02:31:09.88 --> 02:31:13.88
And in order to get there they drop cluster bombs on their path.

2375
02:31:13.88 --> 02:31:15.88
Yeah, for good luck.

2376
02:31:15.88 --> 02:31:21.88
And then that JG32 settled into the jungle, chopping down smaller trees to settle.

2377
02:31:21.88 --> 02:31:23.88
So that way it's bringing a move on.

2378
02:31:23.88 --> 02:31:24.88
Some are protected.

2379
02:31:24.88 --> 02:31:28.88
Yeah, so that way does not visible.

2380
02:31:28.88 --> 02:31:29.88
Not completely exposed.

2381
02:31:29.88 --> 02:31:30.88
They're going to shoot down.

2382
02:31:30.88 --> 02:31:32.88
That's shoot through the jungle to get to him.

2383
02:31:32.88 --> 02:31:36.88
Yeah, it's counterintuitive when you're in the air and a helicopter.

2384
02:31:36.88 --> 02:31:37.88
Yeah, and a helicopter.

2385
02:31:37.88 --> 02:31:44.88
But I guess on fast movers or aircraft as well, you'd think the closer you get to the ground, the more danger you're in.

2386
02:31:44.88 --> 02:31:50.88
But the opposite is actually true because when you get down low enough, people can't shoot it.

2387
02:31:50.88 --> 02:31:51.88
Because they don't have an angle to shoot it to you.

2388
02:31:51.88 --> 02:31:55.88
Whether it's in a city or whether it's in a jungle like this.

2389
02:31:55.88 --> 02:31:57.88
People just, they can't see you anymore because you're low.

2390
02:31:57.88 --> 02:31:58.88
Right.

2391
02:31:58.88 --> 02:32:06.88
The helicopter's in the jungle and then like you said with the A1 Skyraders, the key to their success was how low they made their gun runs.

2392
02:32:06.88 --> 02:32:11.88
They would just come screaming across the path, drop their orders and be on their way.

2393
02:32:11.88 --> 02:32:12.88
Yeah, yeah.

2394
02:32:12.88 --> 02:32:15.88
So anybody else in the jungle, you can hear him coming.

2395
02:32:15.88 --> 02:32:16.88
You can't see him.

2396
02:32:16.88 --> 02:32:17.88
It tells you.

2397
02:32:17.88 --> 02:32:18.88
Yeah.

2398
02:32:18.88 --> 02:32:22.88
You were for a slow move like that, but all we loved him.

2399
02:32:22.88 --> 02:32:33.88
Continuing on thick, choking smoke moves across the LZ, rolling over the ledge above, obscuring our escape from the plane from the plane of death.

2400
02:32:33.88 --> 02:32:36.88
We inch our way toward the last chance.

2401
02:32:36.88 --> 02:32:38.88
Our Clyde's coming.

2402
02:32:38.88 --> 02:32:41.88
Blackjack, the CBU strike has created negative visibility.

2403
02:32:41.88 --> 02:32:44.88
We're unable to provide support until we get a window over.

2404
02:32:44.88 --> 02:32:48.88
You're looking for a window and I'm looking for a door, spider, blackjack.

2405
02:32:48.88 --> 02:32:54.88
The good news is it is also decreased visibility for the NVA gun fires, noticeably subsided.

2406
02:32:54.88 --> 02:33:01.88
Keep up the smoke and we'll move by ear, hugging the face of the cliff, making our way across the rubble of the ledge.

2407
02:33:01.88 --> 02:33:03.88
We come to a dead end.

2408
02:33:03.88 --> 02:33:04.88
Crap.

2409
02:33:04.88 --> 02:33:06.88
We're going to have to climb back up to the plateau.

2410
02:33:06.88 --> 02:33:08.88
Wait here while I take a look.

2411
02:33:08.88 --> 02:33:09.88
If it's okay, I'll signal.

2412
02:33:09.88 --> 02:33:12.88
Easily climbing with the aid of vines trailing over the ledge.

2413
02:33:12.88 --> 02:33:16.88
I crawl over one side and slide under the low vegetation.

2414
02:33:16.88 --> 02:33:18.88
Seconds later, one Woods head appears.

2415
02:33:18.88 --> 02:33:22.88
Spodding me he crawls to my location up under a large broad leaf plant.

2416
02:33:22.88 --> 02:33:24.88
Where's your weapon I ask?

2417
02:33:24.88 --> 02:33:25.88
I don't know.

2418
02:33:25.88 --> 02:33:26.88
He sheepishly replies.

2419
02:33:26.88 --> 02:33:29.88
Take this AK and cover us while I get the rest of the team up here.

2420
02:33:29.88 --> 02:33:30.88
Over.

2421
02:33:30.88 --> 02:33:31.88
Can you do that?

2422
02:33:31.88 --> 02:33:31.88
Uh-huh.

2423
02:33:31.88 --> 02:33:35.88
Lock the zero one is the last person to go over the rim,

2424
02:33:35.88 --> 02:33:39.88
joining the remainder of the team in the undergrowth, giving me two thumbs up.

2425
02:33:39.88 --> 02:33:45.88
As quickly as the underbrush will allow, we move up a small incline under the protection of a normus broad leaf undergrowth.

2426
02:33:45.88 --> 02:33:49.88
Shortly, we come to the periphery of a short ledge where we stop.

2427
02:33:49.88 --> 02:33:54.88
Before us is a conneverace half lit clearing under jungle canopy.

2428
02:33:54.88 --> 02:33:55.88
Look at this.

2429
02:33:55.88 --> 02:34:00.88
Hundreds of large huts built up on still stretch back into the low light.

2430
02:34:00.88 --> 02:34:03.88
Everywhere there are trails, campfires and cooking area.

2431
02:34:03.88 --> 02:34:04.88
Cooking areas.

2432
02:34:04.88 --> 02:34:07.88
Two are left is a latrine in a shower facility.

2433
02:34:07.88 --> 02:34:09.88
Smoke from cooking has fires.

2434
02:34:09.88 --> 02:34:13.88
Spiral upward gently mingling with the battle haze.

2435
02:34:13.88 --> 02:34:16.88
Sealing, drifting just below the canopy.

2436
02:34:16.88 --> 02:34:21.88
Clothes are hung over low plants and ropes strung between towering hardwood trees.

2437
02:34:21.88 --> 02:34:24.88
This must be either main camp.

2438
02:34:24.88 --> 02:34:25.88
This is amazing.

2439
02:34:25.88 --> 02:34:27.88
It's an entire town under the trees.

2440
02:34:27.88 --> 02:34:29.88
No one seems to be home from the sounds of it.

2441
02:34:29.88 --> 02:34:30.88
They must all be over there.

2442
02:34:30.88 --> 02:34:33.88
I say pointing at the direction of JG32.

2443
02:34:33.88 --> 02:34:34.88
Look over there.

2444
02:34:34.88 --> 02:34:35.88
Who's that?

2445
02:34:35.88 --> 02:34:37.88
Looks like an American.

2446
02:34:37.88 --> 02:34:38.88
Hey you.

2447
02:34:38.88 --> 02:34:41.88
He turns pointing a 45-cal over pistol in our direction.

2448
02:34:41.88 --> 02:34:43.88
I stand up motioning him to us.

2449
02:34:43.88 --> 02:34:45.88
He raises a 45-pistol to his lips.

2450
02:34:45.88 --> 02:34:46.88
Saving us to be quiet.

2451
02:34:46.88 --> 02:34:49.88
We cautiously move to his location.

2452
02:34:49.88 --> 02:34:50.88
Who are you?

2453
02:34:50.88 --> 02:34:55.88
I'm the JG10 P.J. Dan Casbier.

2454
02:34:55.88 --> 02:35:00.88
Rotorhead is over there under that hut talking to the 30 talking with 32.

2455
02:35:00.88 --> 02:35:02.88
Who's rotorhead I ask?

2456
02:35:02.88 --> 02:35:04.88
Our pilot Colonel Sam Grineer.

2457
02:35:04.88 --> 02:35:08.88
I think he has a broken back, but he can still walk.

2458
02:35:08.88 --> 02:35:10.88
The other members of your crew did they make it?

2459
02:35:10.88 --> 02:35:12.88
Ten was burning.

2460
02:35:12.88 --> 02:35:15.88
There was only time to get out Grineer before it exploded.

2461
02:35:15.88 --> 02:35:19.88
Our flight engineer Greg Lawrence and co-pilot Dwayne Wester were trapped inside.

2462
02:35:19.88 --> 02:35:21.88
I didn't have time.

2463
02:35:21.88 --> 02:35:22.88
The P.J. Pauzes.

2464
02:35:22.88 --> 02:35:25.88
JG10 exploded before I could get back to them.

2465
02:35:25.88 --> 02:35:29.88
We've been waiting for you guys here hoping we would make it before we had to E&E.

2466
02:35:29.88 --> 02:35:33.88
Grab rotorhead and fall in with a seven of us now.

2467
02:35:33.88 --> 02:35:39.88
So these guys have now just miraculously ran into the pilot.

2468
02:35:39.88 --> 02:35:45.88
The pilot and the pair rescue guy that had that was inside that helicopter that got shot down and then exploded.

2469
02:35:45.88 --> 02:35:47.88
Yeah, and the pilot's got a broken back.

2470
02:35:47.88 --> 02:35:49.88
He's still mobile.

2471
02:35:53.88 --> 02:35:55.88
Yes sir.

2472
02:35:55.88 --> 02:36:00.88
The NVA are focused on JG32 easing pressure on us.

2473
02:36:00.88 --> 02:36:02.88
We need to move there as quickly as possible.

2474
02:36:02.88 --> 02:36:05.88
32 doesn't have much time left on station.

2475
02:36:05.88 --> 02:36:08.88
We have to go now, order Sam Grineer.

2476
02:36:08.88 --> 02:36:11.88
None of us have much time left, form up, we're going home, my demand.

2477
02:36:11.88 --> 02:36:13.88
Casper, help your kernel.

2478
02:36:13.88 --> 02:36:16.88
We can hear them moving through the jungle all around us.

2479
02:36:16.88 --> 02:36:19.88
They seem to be traveling to the ship paralleling us.

2480
02:36:19.88 --> 02:36:22.88
Blackjack, spider, times against you buddy.

2481
02:36:22.88 --> 02:36:26.88
32 can't wait much longer and the arc light is closing fast.

2482
02:36:26.88 --> 02:36:29.88
The B-52s have begun their countdown.

2483
02:36:29.88 --> 02:36:32.88
They're on long final.

2484
02:36:32.88 --> 02:36:34.88
Yeah, you can't make this up.

2485
02:36:34.88 --> 02:36:35.88
No.

2486
02:36:35.88 --> 02:36:38.88
They're just coming into drop bombs all over everything in the area.

2487
02:36:38.88 --> 02:36:42.88
The aircraft that they're trying to get to that could possibly get them home.

2488
02:36:42.88 --> 02:36:45.88
That's hidden in the jungle is almost out of fuel.

2489
02:36:45.88 --> 02:36:48.88
And they can hear as they're moving towards the helicopter,

2490
02:36:48.88 --> 02:36:53.88
they can hear they're being paralleled by the NVA.

2491
02:36:57.88 --> 02:37:00.88
On the move, spider, arc lights on the way.

2492
02:37:00.88 --> 02:37:03.88
We intersect a trail running down the middle of the ravine.

2493
02:37:03.88 --> 02:37:09.88
The helicopter gunships and sky raiders are making blind gun runs up and down the narrow ravine

2494
02:37:09.88 --> 02:37:11.88
and around JG32.

2495
02:37:11.88 --> 02:37:18.88
Smoke from air strikes hangs over the plateau, threading its way down the ravines into the depths of the murky chasm.

2496
02:37:18.88 --> 02:37:22.88
Blackjack, spider, air strikes to clear the way as impossible.

2497
02:37:22.88 --> 02:37:25.88
We can no longer see the jungle let alone your ride home.

2498
02:37:25.88 --> 02:37:27.88
Get a move on over.

2499
02:37:27.88 --> 02:37:31.88
I feel as though we are moving past mad dogs guarding the gates of hell itself

2500
02:37:31.88 --> 02:37:36.88
and via our pouring small arms fire and rocket propelled grenades into the hovering chopper

2501
02:37:36.88 --> 02:37:40.88
while door gunners and pilots intermittently fire the gattling gun in M60s.

2502
02:37:40.88 --> 02:37:44.88
Desperate, I move the team and onto the trail toward the hovering ship.

2503
02:37:44.88 --> 02:37:46.88
Don't move on a trail, you dumbass.

2504
02:37:46.88 --> 02:37:50.88
Well, this is one of those times when jungle rules don't apply.

2505
02:37:50.88 --> 02:37:52.88
Amen.

2506
02:37:52.88 --> 02:37:55.88
So they can see the helicopter, they can see that it's taken fire.

2507
02:37:55.88 --> 02:37:57.88
There's a trail.

2508
02:37:57.88 --> 02:38:05.88
And you guys and anyone in Vietnam is constantly avoiding the trails because that's where ambushes and booby traps get set.

2509
02:38:05.88 --> 02:38:07.88
But in this situation there's no choice.

2510
02:38:07.88 --> 02:38:10.88
No choice.

2511
02:38:10.88 --> 02:38:12.88
We progress hastily.

2512
02:38:12.88 --> 02:38:16.88
Tail gunner begins violently shaking and is turned to pasty white.

2513
02:38:16.88 --> 02:38:19.88
To the Vietnamese assistant, hiding him in thick bushes.

2514
02:38:19.88 --> 02:38:22.88
So tail gunner is your rear security guy.

2515
02:38:22.88 --> 02:38:25.88
And he's the one shot in the ground.

2516
02:38:25.88 --> 02:38:27.88
He's losing blood.

2517
02:38:27.88 --> 02:38:28.88
He's pale white.

2518
02:38:28.88 --> 02:38:31.88
To the Vietnamese assistant, hiding him in thick bushes.

2519
02:38:31.88 --> 02:38:33.88
Then they flee to the chopper.

2520
02:38:33.88 --> 02:38:34.88
I stopped them taking lead.

2521
02:38:34.88 --> 02:38:39.88
At the at the crest, we see JG32 taking hits and dealing out death.

2522
02:38:39.88 --> 02:38:41.88
It's M60 is red hot.

2523
02:38:41.88 --> 02:38:43.88
Someone is firing an M16 out of rear port.

2524
02:38:43.88 --> 02:38:48.88
As we move to JG32, the intensive gunfire seems to multiply a hundredfold.

2525
02:38:48.88 --> 02:38:50.88
Jesus, the air is so full of lead.

2526
02:38:50.88 --> 02:38:51.88
I can see it.

2527
02:38:51.88 --> 02:38:53.88
I report to myself loudly.

2528
02:38:53.88 --> 02:38:57.88
Full and bits of metal skin are falling from the aircraft as we approach.

2529
02:38:57.88 --> 02:39:02.88
On one side of the turbine, culling is lying on the jungle floor.

2530
02:39:02.88 --> 02:39:05.88
Blackjack spider, who are you talking to over?

2531
02:39:05.88 --> 02:39:08.88
God Buddha, anyone that'll listen.

2532
02:39:08.88 --> 02:39:13.88
Spider, blackjack star, I didn't realize I held the radio keyed over.

2533
02:39:13.88 --> 02:39:18.88
The jungle penetrator from JG's winch smashes into the ground and then raises a couple feet.

2534
02:39:18.88 --> 02:39:23.88
PJ Dan Casper scrambles to put three team members on the first load.

2535
02:39:23.88 --> 02:39:27.88
When you get in the chopper, man a gun and return fire protect us.

2536
02:39:27.88 --> 02:39:28.88
I yell after them.

2537
02:39:28.88 --> 02:39:35.88
Roter had him and the PJ along with quang, a wounded Alabama Vietnamese are on the second lift.

2538
02:39:35.88 --> 02:39:38.88
Quang becomes entangled in jungle vines while being hoisted.

2539
02:39:38.88 --> 02:39:42.88
The operator has to stop the hoist lower it to give him time to untangle himself.

2540
02:39:42.88 --> 02:39:46.88
When the hoist moves up toward the aircraft, quang is not sitting in the seat.

2541
02:39:46.88 --> 02:39:49.88
But hanging on with assistance from Casper.

2542
02:39:49.88 --> 02:39:55.88
Quang, I return tracing, I return retracing our path back down the trail to the thicket

2543
02:39:55.88 --> 02:39:57.88
where we had left our tail gunner.

2544
02:39:57.88 --> 02:40:02.88
Halfway back, I realize I'm alone with no weapon.

2545
02:40:02.88 --> 02:40:05.88
For the first time paralyzing fear sweeps through me.

2546
02:40:05.88 --> 02:40:09.88
I stop. What am I doing? You couldn't help you when he was hit.

2547
02:40:09.88 --> 02:40:10.88
But you can, quang.

2548
02:40:10.88 --> 02:40:14.88
Face the boogie, man. Do your job asshole move.

2549
02:40:14.88 --> 02:40:20.88
Quang is covered with bloated black leeches, mosquitoes and giant flies feeding off the last of his

2550
02:40:20.88 --> 02:40:21.88
Ebing life.

2551
02:40:21.88 --> 02:40:26.88
Mumbling, he wobbles his cult 45 at advancing NVA.

2552
02:40:26.88 --> 02:40:27.88
Toy ki.

2553
02:40:27.88 --> 02:40:29.88
I die.

2554
02:40:29.88 --> 02:40:33.88
The tail gunner motions to me to return to the jolly green.

2555
02:40:33.88 --> 02:40:34.88
I turn.

2556
02:40:34.88 --> 02:40:36.88
Quang shoots himself.

2557
02:40:36.88 --> 02:40:38.88
He's sons of bitches.

2558
02:40:38.88 --> 02:40:41.88
My cry is lost in the sounds of battle.

2559
02:40:41.88 --> 02:40:46.88
I hear his obscure vision as I scramble like a raving lunateck back in the direction of the

2560
02:40:46.88 --> 02:40:47.88
waiting ship.

2561
02:40:47.88 --> 02:40:51.88
Smat rushing smack into two screaming NVA.

2562
02:40:51.88 --> 02:40:53.88
Their AK's pointed at me.

2563
02:40:53.88 --> 02:40:56.88
Chuhui.

2564
02:40:56.88 --> 02:40:59.88
I surrender.

2565
02:40:59.88 --> 02:41:04.88
Surrendering, stretching out my arms, continuing to move quickly in their direction.

2566
02:41:04.88 --> 02:41:07.88
Within arms reach, I yell in their faces.

2567
02:41:07.88 --> 02:41:09.88
Chuhui yourself, mother fucker.

2568
02:41:09.88 --> 02:41:13.88
The young soldiers are taken by surprise before they can respond by grab a searing hot

2569
02:41:13.88 --> 02:41:16.88
AK-47 barrel jerking the weapon from one of them.

2570
02:41:16.88 --> 02:41:19.88
Blistered skin rolls off my hand.

2571
02:41:19.88 --> 02:41:23.88
I backhand the one on my right and smash the soldier on my left and the face with his own weapon.

2572
02:41:23.88 --> 02:41:25.88
Hot hot hot hot.

2573
02:41:25.88 --> 02:41:29.88
I scramble to the penetrator, finding a praying one on the ground.

2574
02:41:29.88 --> 02:41:34.88
The rest of the team have abandoned him and are on board firing any weapon they can

2575
02:41:34.88 --> 02:41:36.88
get their hands on.

2576
02:41:36.88 --> 02:41:39.88
As the penetrator lifts and what seems like slow motion.

2577
02:41:39.88 --> 02:41:44.88
One one and I look upward wondering what the hell is taking so long.

2578
02:41:44.88 --> 02:41:48.88
We are shoured with hot, spent and 16 other weapon shell casing.

2579
02:41:48.88 --> 02:41:53.88
Hot brass is sticking to my bare skin, creating long water blisters.

2580
02:41:53.88 --> 02:41:56.88
Similar to ones on my hand from the AK I grabbed.

2581
02:41:56.88 --> 02:41:59.88
The air is filled with smoke, jet fuel and green tracers.

2582
02:41:59.88 --> 02:42:02.88
Moving past us in slow motion like mad hornets.

2583
02:42:02.88 --> 02:42:09.88
Never ending shell casing is raining down along with metal debris and a tornado of jungle vegetation.

2584
02:42:09.88 --> 02:42:12.88
The penetrator cable is vibrating violently.

2585
02:42:12.88 --> 02:42:16.88
As JG32 takes hit after hit, it's all coming apart.

2586
02:42:16.88 --> 02:42:19.88
I yell at one one.

2587
02:42:19.88 --> 02:42:31.88
JG32 piloted by Lieutenant Colonel Jim Grady begins lifting out of the jungle ravine with the two of us hanging on below like a couple of crippled puppets on a quarter inch steel

2588
02:42:31.88 --> 02:42:32.88
wire.

2589
02:42:32.88 --> 02:42:35.88
There are several great trees on both sides of the ship.

2590
02:42:35.88 --> 02:42:41.88
All of them large enough to severely damage the five 62 foot rotors causing it to crash.

2591
02:42:41.88 --> 02:42:49.88
A sending out of the jungle, we can feel the heat of B40 rocket motors as they pass by on their way to slamming into JG32's.

2592
02:42:49.88 --> 02:42:51.88
Plated underside.

2593
02:42:51.88 --> 02:42:54.88
The ship is being boosted upward with each explosion.

2594
02:42:54.88 --> 02:42:59.88
I slump on the penetrator and begin sliding off as my backside is sprayed with shrapnel.

2595
02:42:59.88 --> 02:43:01.88
Hey, that hurts.

2596
02:43:01.88 --> 02:43:06.88
One one grabs hold, wrapping his arms around me, saving my life.

2597
02:43:06.88 --> 02:43:09.88
Hope what's left of the armor holds.

2598
02:43:09.88 --> 02:43:13.88
I I weakly yell, grasping at the penetrator cable for balance.

2599
02:43:13.88 --> 02:43:23.88
The JG flight mechanic reaches out, pulling me off the penetrator into the ship, dumping me on red hot shell covered deck with one one on my heels.

2600
02:43:23.88 --> 02:43:33.88
Parar rescue specialist Allen Avery leaves his gun position and begins tending to Alabama's wounds.

2601
02:43:33.88 --> 02:43:37.88
Once clear of the jungle hole, the ship begins as a sent out of the valley.

2602
02:43:37.88 --> 02:43:43.88
The flight mechanic, sergeant John Nussbaum, removes his helmet and places it on my head.

2603
02:43:43.88 --> 02:43:50.88
Copilot Major Don Olsen tells me we're on our way out of here, partner.

2604
02:43:50.88 --> 02:43:55.88
I'm cold.

2605
02:43:55.88 --> 02:44:00.88
Lieutenant Ad Analyst breaks the silence.

2606
02:44:00.88 --> 02:44:04.88
One one, do you have anything to add to Jack Blackjack story?

2607
02:44:04.88 --> 02:44:08.88
No sir, he softly mumbles with his head down.

2608
02:44:08.88 --> 02:44:11.88
How many enviades you think we're in the area?

2609
02:44:11.88 --> 02:44:13.88
How many do you think we're killed or wounded?

2610
02:44:13.88 --> 02:44:16.88
Ask sergeant analysis.

2611
02:44:16.88 --> 02:44:22.88
I believe the question was directed to one one, but before he can muster with an answer, I jump in.

2612
02:44:22.88 --> 02:44:26.88
The answer to the both of those questions is more than we had time to count.

2613
02:44:26.88 --> 02:44:32.88
However, I'll estimate somewhere between 3 to 5,000 and VA.

2614
02:44:32.88 --> 02:44:37.88
How many did we kill before we round out of R ammo? We killed hundreds.

2615
02:44:37.88 --> 02:44:43.88
When we started using their weapons, we killed hundreds more between us and the air support, maybe two or three thousand.

2616
02:44:43.88 --> 02:44:46.88
The arc light followed that after we left.

2617
02:44:46.88 --> 02:44:50.88
I hope they finished off the rest of them.

2618
02:44:54.88 --> 02:44:56.88
Crazy.

2619
02:44:56.88 --> 02:44:57.88
Oh yeah.

2620
02:44:57.88 --> 02:45:02.88
And then that Jolly Green Giant couldn't fly too far.

2621
02:45:02.88 --> 02:45:05.88
It only went over two more mountain tops.

2622
02:45:05.88 --> 02:45:08.88
It lands and another one comes in, picks up some of the guys.

2623
02:45:08.88 --> 02:45:16.88
Then Lynn and the one one had to go back on the cober gunship because the cober, the weapon doors come down.

2624
02:45:16.88 --> 02:45:18.88
They have seat belts on them.

2625
02:45:18.88 --> 02:45:19.88
Oh my god.

2626
02:45:19.88 --> 02:45:28.88
So all the way from Layhouse back to Denang, they're with the, yeah, just a top everything off for them.

2627
02:45:28.88 --> 02:45:30.88
And he froze their balls off, of course.

2628
02:45:30.88 --> 02:45:32.88
Could they're dangling out there? 5,000 feet on that.

2629
02:45:32.88 --> 02:45:39.88
On that, they could have 5,000 feet to get away from any enemy fire.

2630
02:45:39.88 --> 02:45:45.88
And the, and of course the model of the Jolly Greens that others may live.

2631
02:45:45.88 --> 02:45:46.88
Yeah.

2632
02:45:46.88 --> 02:45:49.88
That day they put it right on the line.

2633
02:45:49.88 --> 02:45:50.88
Amazing.

2634
02:45:50.88 --> 02:45:53.88
Going in after you see multiple birds shot down.

2635
02:45:53.88 --> 02:45:55.88
Like, oh, one bird goes and get shot out.

2636
02:45:55.88 --> 02:45:57.88
The next bird goes and get shot out.

2637
02:45:57.88 --> 02:45:59.88
The next bird goes and get shot down.

2638
02:45:59.88 --> 02:46:00.88
And you're still coming in.

2639
02:46:00.88 --> 02:46:01.88
We're here.

2640
02:46:01.88 --> 02:46:04.88
And one got shot up so bad, limp back to base.

2641
02:46:04.88 --> 02:46:10.88
Really got back.

2642
02:46:10.88 --> 02:46:16.88
They continue on with this debrief and in one of the analysts says, tell us about the terrain again.

2643
02:46:16.88 --> 02:46:19.88
One one, you were closer to the terrain than I was.

2644
02:46:19.88 --> 02:46:21.88
Why don't you answer that question?

2645
02:46:21.88 --> 02:46:24.88
One one breaks down.

2646
02:46:24.88 --> 02:46:27.88
A medical aid gives him a sedative.

2647
02:46:27.88 --> 02:46:31.88
To quiet his nerves.

2648
02:46:31.88 --> 02:46:34.88
He's been through a lot, I saw.

2649
02:46:34.88 --> 02:46:37.88
Do you also need to sedative?

2650
02:46:37.88 --> 02:46:38.88
Ask the medic.

2651
02:46:38.88 --> 02:46:39.88
No thanks.

2652
02:46:39.88 --> 02:46:41.88
I don't handle any kind of drugs very well.

2653
02:46:41.88 --> 02:46:43.88
If I take that, I'll be asleep in 10 minutes.

2654
02:46:43.88 --> 02:46:47.88
Give me an understanding of where you are physically and psychologically.

2655
02:46:47.88 --> 02:46:49.88
Ask one of the medics.

2656
02:46:49.88 --> 02:46:52.88
Physically today, I'm less than 50%.

2657
02:46:52.88 --> 02:46:55.88
I took some hard hits and I'm still trying to recover.

2658
02:46:55.88 --> 02:46:57.88
Psychologically who the heck knows.

2659
02:46:57.88 --> 02:47:01.88
Anyone doing this kind of work is probably crazy from the get go.

2660
02:47:01.88 --> 02:47:02.88
You know what I mean?

2661
02:47:02.88 --> 02:47:07.88
A combat soldier focuses on what they feel physically, what they see here in smell, feelings

2662
02:47:07.88 --> 02:47:12.88
of fear, sadness, boredom, and joy are suppressed as much as possible so we can focus

2663
02:47:12.88 --> 02:47:16.88
on the mission, our team, and staying alive.

2664
02:47:16.88 --> 02:47:20.88
The psychological stuff has to come later or we won't make it.

2665
02:47:20.88 --> 02:47:22.88
Does that make sense to you?

2666
02:47:22.88 --> 02:47:26.88
There you go. It's a classic thing. We're putting off all this stuff, like not worrying about

2667
02:47:26.88 --> 02:47:29.88
it right now. We got a job to do.

2668
02:47:29.88 --> 02:47:32.88
The medic looks up from taking notes.

2669
02:47:32.88 --> 02:47:36.88
It will do for now. Please continue with your train of thought.

2670
02:47:36.88 --> 02:47:41.88
As soon as my wounds fully close and the stitches come out, I'll begin training again.

2671
02:47:41.88 --> 02:47:47.88
I heal fast and definitely have some ideas on needed training for Alabama to be an effective team.

2672
02:47:47.88 --> 02:47:51.88
Don't you think that's up to the 102 determine what training is needed for his team?

2673
02:47:51.88 --> 02:47:54.88
One one perks up.

2674
02:47:54.88 --> 02:47:57.88
I jump in ahead of him. Yes sir.

2675
02:47:57.88 --> 02:48:02.88
No sir. I mean, it's up to all of us to conduct training as Americans.

2676
02:48:02.88 --> 02:48:09.88
The welfare of a special forces team is the responsibility of every man on that team.

2677
02:48:09.88 --> 02:48:16.88
If the designated leader can't lead, then it's incumbent on any one of us to step forward and provide that leadership.

2678
02:48:16.88 --> 02:48:20.88
That's what I did and that's what I'll do again if needed.

2679
02:48:20.88 --> 02:48:23.88
So there you go.

2680
02:48:23.88 --> 02:48:24.88
Oh yeah.

2681
02:48:24.88 --> 02:48:26.88
Real leadership.

2682
02:48:26.88 --> 02:48:28.88
Pure leadership.

2683
02:48:28.88 --> 02:48:29.88
Feelers.

2684
02:48:29.88 --> 02:48:31.88
Feelers.

2685
02:48:34.88 --> 02:48:38.88
So you're ready to go do it again.

2686
02:48:38.88 --> 02:48:44.88
And you think to himself, I've heard that several guys have hung it up after the first mission.

2687
02:48:44.88 --> 02:48:47.88
I think I know why.

2688
02:48:47.88 --> 02:48:49.88
It's these damn debriefs.

2689
02:48:49.88 --> 02:48:52.88
Yeah.

2690
02:48:52.88 --> 02:48:57.88
They were a pain in the ass. That's for sure.

2691
02:48:57.88 --> 02:49:04.88
The analyst continues our best intelligence indicates there's probably, I think this is,

2692
02:49:04.88 --> 02:49:07.88
yeah, this is the chiefsog.

2693
02:49:07.88 --> 02:49:12.88
Our best intelligence indicates that there's approximately 2,000 miles of trail.

2694
02:49:12.88 --> 02:49:15.88
And between 12 to 15 being tram.

2695
02:49:15.88 --> 02:49:19.88
And those are like, Ben tram is like these organizations.

2696
02:49:19.88 --> 02:49:20.88
What are they like?

2697
02:49:20.88 --> 02:49:21.88
Battalion sized.

2698
02:49:21.88 --> 02:49:23.88
It was a long trail.

2699
02:49:23.88 --> 02:49:27.88
There'd be a command control element as well as a hospital overnight

2700
02:49:27.88 --> 02:49:28.88
Rest facilities.

2701
02:49:28.88 --> 02:49:31.88
And then from near they run people out to keep the trails open.

2702
02:49:31.88 --> 02:49:34.88
Work with the local indigenous people, the conscripts.

2703
02:49:34.88 --> 02:49:37.88
Could they constantly bomb in a trail?

2704
02:49:37.88 --> 02:49:41.88
So these are organizations along the trail.

2705
02:49:41.88 --> 02:49:42.88
They're called Ben trams.

2706
02:49:42.88 --> 02:49:50.88
Then thousands of anti-aircraft guns, 20 to 30,000 support soldiers all defended by 40 to 60,000 security troops.

2707
02:49:50.88 --> 02:49:52.88
That's what we need intel on.

2708
02:49:52.88 --> 02:49:54.88
Are you ready to take another whack at it?

2709
02:49:54.88 --> 02:49:58.88
Chiefsog asks half grinning at the two of us.

2710
02:49:58.88 --> 02:50:01.88
Whiskey Tango Fox shot.

2711
02:50:01.88 --> 02:50:04.88
I'm not sure I really wanted to know that.

2712
02:50:04.88 --> 02:50:07.88
I will be once the wounds have healed.

2713
02:50:07.88 --> 02:50:11.88
When I'm in better physical condition and we get the training that I talked about.

2714
02:50:11.88 --> 02:50:15.88
And after I have a couple more beers, tell me about what you thought about out there.

2715
02:50:15.88 --> 02:50:19.88
Ask the tall slender gray hair medical officer on the other side of the table.

2716
02:50:19.88 --> 02:50:23.88
Behind him sits two obvious assistance taking notes.

2717
02:50:23.88 --> 02:50:27.88
When things didn't I just answer the question a few minutes ago?

2718
02:50:27.88 --> 02:50:29.88
These guys are not going to let up.

2719
02:50:29.88 --> 02:50:31.88
And then he says, do you mean me personally?

2720
02:50:31.88 --> 02:50:33.88
Yes, you personally.

2721
02:50:33.88 --> 02:50:35.88
What went through your mind?

2722
02:50:35.88 --> 02:50:37.88
What emotions did you feel?

2723
02:50:37.88 --> 02:50:39.88
How much detail are you asking for?

2724
02:50:39.88 --> 02:50:41.88
God, I hate it.

2725
02:50:41.88 --> 02:50:43.88
And he thinks himself, God, I hate this.

2726
02:50:43.88 --> 02:50:45.88
How did you feel?

2727
02:50:45.88 --> 02:50:45.88
Shit.

2728
02:50:45.88 --> 02:50:47.88
Did I answer that question a few minutes ago?

2729
02:50:47.88 --> 02:50:55.88
We've heard excellent tour guide level detail from the point of the initial ambush to your team's extraction.

2730
02:50:55.88 --> 02:50:59.88
Tell us about the period of time from the point of insertion to the ambush.

2731
02:50:59.88 --> 02:51:00.88
Take your time.

2732
02:51:00.88 --> 02:51:02.88
Give me a tour of your thoughts.

2733
02:51:02.88 --> 02:51:03.88
What were you thinking?

2734
02:51:03.88 --> 02:51:05.88
I leaned back in my chair, pausing.

2735
02:51:05.88 --> 02:51:06.88
Thinking.

2736
02:51:06.88 --> 02:51:09.88
I'm a guy.

2737
02:51:09.88 --> 02:51:13.88
I'm a guy, not some woman who wants to do nothing but talk about her feelings.

2738
02:51:13.88 --> 02:51:15.88
I don't think about their feelings.

2739
02:51:15.88 --> 02:51:16.88
This is just his thoughts.

2740
02:51:16.88 --> 02:51:19.88
We're either happy, sad, thirsty, horny, or hungry.

2741
02:51:19.88 --> 02:51:22.88
Okay, calm the hell down and give him an answer.

2742
02:51:22.88 --> 02:51:27.88
And then he says, I was on the second king bee.

2743
02:51:27.88 --> 02:51:33.88
We watched Bulldog and the others disembark from the first ship just before our spiral began.

2744
02:51:33.88 --> 02:51:36.88
Our door gunner announced, we go down now.

2745
02:51:36.88 --> 02:51:38.88
Chuckles around the room.

2746
02:51:38.88 --> 02:51:43.88
We assumed the get ready position with me sitting in the door.

2747
02:51:43.88 --> 02:51:46.88
The lottery LZ corkscrewed up to meet us.

2748
02:51:46.88 --> 02:51:47.88
Several feet off touchdown.

2749
02:51:47.88 --> 02:51:50.88
I spotted an NVA flag posted near the edge.

2750
02:51:50.88 --> 02:51:53.88
I remember thinking, oh, crap.

2751
02:51:53.88 --> 02:51:56.88
Several of them laugh or quietly chuckle.

2752
02:51:56.88 --> 02:51:57.88
What?

2753
02:51:57.88 --> 02:52:02.88
You spotted freaking NVA flag on the landing zone?

2754
02:52:02.88 --> 02:52:05.88
Yeah, I think he goes until the moment we're disheveled.

2755
02:52:05.88 --> 02:52:06.88
Yeah, yeah.

2756
02:52:06.88 --> 02:52:07.88
Specialist black.

2757
02:52:07.88 --> 02:52:08.88
I've heard about the mission.

2758
02:52:08.88 --> 02:52:10.88
I want to know about your feelings.

2759
02:52:10.88 --> 02:52:11.88
What you felt emotionally.

2760
02:52:11.88 --> 02:52:13.88
Do you understand?

2761
02:52:13.88 --> 02:52:14.88
Well, sir.

2762
02:52:14.88 --> 02:52:15.88
Oh, crap.

2763
02:52:15.88 --> 02:52:17.88
To me, is it pretty strong feeling?

2764
02:52:17.88 --> 02:52:19.88
How everyone assultors in that situation.

2765
02:52:19.88 --> 02:52:22.88
That causes thoughts like, oh, crap or others.

2766
02:52:22.88 --> 02:52:25.88
We usually don't have time to stop and consider our feelings.

2767
02:52:25.88 --> 02:52:27.88
As soon as our king bee tires bounced down,

2768
02:52:27.88 --> 02:52:29.88
Tracer's punched in the side of our ship.

2769
02:52:29.88 --> 02:52:31.88
We got the hell out of there.

2770
02:52:31.88 --> 02:52:33.88
Remember thinking what a mistake that was.

2771
02:52:33.88 --> 02:52:36.88
Actually, sir, it was more like we are screwed.

2772
02:52:36.88 --> 02:52:37.88
Blackjack.

2773
02:52:37.88 --> 02:52:39.88
The sergeant major objects.

2774
02:52:39.88 --> 02:52:40.88
Yes, sergeant major.

2775
02:52:40.88 --> 02:52:44.88
In mid lift off the green, swarming, gulf the ship like a disturbed nest of hornets.

2776
02:52:44.88 --> 02:52:46.88
The king bee hung in mid air, laboring.

2777
02:52:46.88 --> 02:52:49.88
Slipping to its left, the pilot wrestling with the stick.

2778
02:52:49.88 --> 02:52:53.88
His co-pilot was slumped in a seat down it went in a ball of flames.

2779
02:52:53.88 --> 02:52:56.88
The two scar-faced ships providing covet provided covering fire.

2780
02:52:56.88 --> 02:53:00.88
As I move my portion of the Alabama to link up with the one zero.

2781
02:53:00.88 --> 02:53:03.88
I yelled a bulldog that we needed to get off the LZ.

2782
02:53:03.88 --> 02:53:04.88
He ordered us to form up.

2783
02:53:04.88 --> 02:53:08.88
We quickly moved and a low-crouch through the knee-high razor grass to a log.

2784
02:53:08.88 --> 02:53:10.88
We were bulldog and the others were.

2785
02:53:10.88 --> 02:53:13.88
We were knee-deep and kimchi and I knew it.

2786
02:53:19.88 --> 02:53:21.88
And there's a little bit of a...

2787
02:53:23.88 --> 02:53:27.88
A little bit of a tension between bulldog.

2788
02:53:27.88 --> 02:53:29.88
Yeah, between bulldog.

2789
02:53:29.88 --> 02:53:32.88
And blackjack.

2790
02:53:32.88 --> 02:53:36.88
And when that tension, I'm a fast forward a little bit.

2791
02:53:36.88 --> 02:53:39.88
He said, did it make it the one of the analysts says,

2792
02:53:39.88 --> 02:53:40.88
Did it make you anger?

2793
02:53:40.88 --> 02:53:41.88
Angry?

2794
02:53:41.88 --> 02:53:42.88
How did it make you feel?

2795
02:53:42.88 --> 02:53:43.88
I didn't care.

2796
02:53:43.88 --> 02:53:44.88
I came back here to do a job.

2797
02:53:44.88 --> 02:53:46.88
Why did you come back?

2798
02:53:46.88 --> 02:53:48.88
The medical officer insists.

2799
02:53:48.88 --> 02:53:52.88
Because they nailed my brother and best friend and several of the guys in my 173rd unit.

2800
02:53:52.88 --> 02:53:54.88
I came back here to get even.

2801
02:53:54.88 --> 02:53:56.88
Is that what you want to know?

2802
02:53:56.88 --> 02:53:57.88
Am I mad?

2803
02:53:57.88 --> 02:53:58.88
No.

2804
02:53:58.88 --> 02:54:01.88
I was going to be the first time when I got out the first time and went home.

2805
02:54:01.88 --> 02:54:04.88
It bugged me that so many of us had been killed and wounded.

2806
02:54:04.88 --> 02:54:06.88
And I couldn't really say I had seen the enemy.

2807
02:54:06.88 --> 02:54:07.88
I felt like a failure.

2808
02:54:07.88 --> 02:54:09.88
I'm going to fight... I'm going to war.

2809
02:54:09.88 --> 02:54:11.88
If I'm going to fight in a war, I want to see the enemy.

2810
02:54:11.88 --> 02:54:16.88
I want to look on their face when I pulled the trigger or I have them roasted with Napalm.

2811
02:54:16.88 --> 02:54:18.88
Are you getting what you need with this answer?

2812
02:54:18.88 --> 02:54:20.88
And then you think, stones self.

2813
02:54:20.88 --> 02:54:21.88
Don't ask me this.

2814
02:54:21.88 --> 02:54:22.88
Shit again.

2815
02:54:22.88 --> 02:54:25.88
I'm here doing a job that most of the guys back home don't want to do.

2816
02:54:25.88 --> 02:54:26.88
Just be satisfied.

2817
02:54:26.88 --> 02:54:29.88
You can get people like me who want to be up here and are qualified.

2818
02:54:29.88 --> 02:54:30.88
Yes.

2819
02:54:30.88 --> 02:54:31.88
Thank you.

2820
02:54:31.88 --> 02:54:33.88
The medical officer deadpants.

2821
02:54:33.88 --> 02:54:35.88
Black continue on with the narration.

2822
02:54:35.88 --> 02:54:37.88
Instructs Lieutenant Analyst.

2823
02:54:37.88 --> 02:54:40.88
And with feeling his norths.

2824
02:54:40.88 --> 02:54:50.88
Again, this whole scene is just straight out of a freaking Hollywood movie of, you know, the combat soldier

2825
02:54:50.88 --> 02:54:55.88
fresh off the battlefield getting interrogated by these ramps.

2826
02:54:55.88 --> 02:54:59.88
And even there, like the whole thing with the flag and experience one zero would have gone

2827
02:54:59.88 --> 02:55:01.88
but said no, we're out of here.

2828
02:55:01.88 --> 02:55:04.88
They had a green one zero.

2829
02:55:04.88 --> 02:55:07.88
And then try to, I don't know if I fit Giffy closer to the DJ.

2830
02:55:07.88 --> 02:55:09.88
Yeah, he goes into it a little bit.

2831
02:55:09.88 --> 02:55:10.88
But he wouldn't listen.

2832
02:55:10.88 --> 02:55:13.88
There was just a couple of like that little bit of disagreement.

2833
02:55:13.88 --> 02:55:16.88
You know, why didn't Sergeant Stride make you the radio operator.

2834
02:55:16.88 --> 02:55:18.88
One, two and black the one, one.

2835
02:55:18.88 --> 02:55:20.88
He goes through this, you know.

2836
02:55:20.88 --> 02:55:21.88
Yeah.

2837
02:55:29.88 --> 02:55:31.88
So he continues here.

2838
02:55:31.88 --> 02:55:33.88
Yes, sir.

2839
02:55:33.88 --> 02:55:39.88
Kovie asked for a sit rep at which time I reported that the second king be was shot down.

2840
02:55:39.88 --> 02:55:43.88
And we were waiting for Bulldog to make a go-no-go decision.

2841
02:55:43.88 --> 02:55:49.88
Mandolin asked to talk with Bulldog who said he was going to continue with the mission.

2842
02:55:49.88 --> 02:55:56.88
He then motioned to our point man to move over to a well-traveled trail across the LZ into the jungle.

2843
02:55:56.88 --> 02:56:03.88
Cowboy point, the Vietnamese team leader, lock and I vigorously argued against walking a trail,

2844
02:56:03.88 --> 02:56:06.88
especially when we had already made contact to be honest.

2845
02:56:06.88 --> 02:56:08.88
I thought the order was stupid there.

2846
02:56:08.88 --> 02:56:09.88
I said it.

2847
02:56:09.88 --> 02:56:10.88
And he's thinking to himself there, I said it.

2848
02:56:10.88 --> 02:56:12.88
You want to know how I feel?

2849
02:56:12.88 --> 02:56:13.88
That's it.

2850
02:56:13.88 --> 02:56:15.88
So this is when you're the tension that we were talking about.

2851
02:56:15.88 --> 02:56:19.88
Lieutenant Analyst, his face red eyes narrowed.

2852
02:56:19.88 --> 02:56:23.88
You argued with your one zero in the middle of making contact with the enemy.

2853
02:56:23.88 --> 02:56:26.88
And then Lynn thinks himself your asses in trouble now.

2854
02:56:26.88 --> 02:56:27.88
Keep calm.

2855
02:56:27.88 --> 02:56:30.88
He's never been in a combat situation except maybe fighting with his older sister.

2856
02:56:30.88 --> 02:56:35.88
The first rule of recon is never used trails, especially well-traveled trails.

2857
02:56:35.88 --> 02:56:39.88
That trail I said destroyed definitely fits that category.

2858
02:56:39.88 --> 02:56:43.88
He told me he was in command and that I would follow his orders without questions.

2859
02:56:43.88 --> 02:56:45.88
Did you? Yes, sir.

2860
02:56:45.88 --> 02:56:47.88
Into really deep kimchi.

2861
02:56:47.88 --> 02:56:50.88
Continue the chief orders impatiently.

2862
02:56:50.88 --> 02:56:54.88
Bulldog angrily motion to the team to move up on the trail.

2863
02:56:54.88 --> 02:56:58.88
Point leading the way with Bulldog pushing from behind on his rucksack.

2864
02:56:58.88 --> 02:57:02.88
The trail wound into dense jungle foliage bending to the left.

2865
02:57:02.88 --> 02:57:05.88
Point tried to move cautiously paralleling a small team.

2866
02:57:05.88 --> 02:57:08.88
A small 10 to 20 foot rise to a right.

2867
02:57:08.88 --> 02:57:12.88
Bulldog hurried him along pushing pushing him to his death.

2868
02:57:12.88 --> 02:57:15.88
Is that statement necessary?

2869
02:57:15.88 --> 02:57:18.88
Lieutenant analysts, sarcastically cracks?

2870
02:57:18.88 --> 02:57:21.88
I was instructed to tell you what I was personally thinking.

2871
02:57:21.88 --> 02:57:25.88
I was the only American on the team with Vietnam experience with combat experience.

2872
02:57:25.88 --> 02:57:28.88
I was the fourth person in line right behind cowboy.

2873
02:57:28.88 --> 02:57:32.88
I think Sergeant Strides experience went back to an 18 in Korea.

2874
02:57:32.88 --> 02:57:35.88
And one one had never seen combat.

2875
02:57:35.88 --> 02:57:37.88
Is that statement necessary?

2876
02:57:37.88 --> 02:57:38.88
I think so.

2877
02:57:38.88 --> 02:57:38.88
Yes.

2878
02:57:38.88 --> 02:57:41.88
Rankin combat experience are not necessarily synonymous.

2879
02:57:41.88 --> 02:57:42.88
Don't you agree?

2880
02:57:42.88 --> 02:57:45.88
And he says, sometimes stay calm, stay calm.

2881
02:57:45.88 --> 02:57:48.88
Point taken.

2882
02:57:48.88 --> 02:57:51.88
How did you feel when taking fire on insertion?

2883
02:57:51.88 --> 02:57:53.88
Asked the dog.

2884
02:57:53.88 --> 02:57:56.88
When we took fire going in, I felt anxious.

2885
02:57:56.88 --> 02:57:58.88
He thinks so himself.

2886
02:57:58.88 --> 02:57:59.88
That's an understatement.

2887
02:57:59.88 --> 02:58:00.88
Scared to shit out of me.

2888
02:58:00.88 --> 02:58:05.88
That anxiety turned to disbelief when Bulldog made the decision to continue the mission.

2889
02:58:05.88 --> 02:58:08.88
And then again, when the decision was made to walk a trail.

2890
02:58:08.88 --> 02:58:12.88
I remained on the state of high alert right up to the ambush.

2891
02:58:12.88 --> 02:58:14.88
An interesting thing happened.

2892
02:58:14.88 --> 02:58:16.88
They all laughed.

2893
02:58:16.88 --> 02:58:19.88
We can imagine people were killing your teammates and you were pinned down.

2894
02:58:19.88 --> 02:58:22.88
How much more interesting could it get?

2895
02:58:22.88 --> 02:58:24.88
Observes Sergeant Analyst.

2896
02:58:24.88 --> 02:58:26.88
They all nervously laugh again.

2897
02:58:26.88 --> 02:58:28.88
I sit silent.

2898
02:58:28.88 --> 02:58:30.88
Expressionless.

2899
02:58:30.88 --> 02:58:32.88
Looking into each of their eyes.

2900
02:58:32.88 --> 02:58:35.88
The medical officer is quietly observing me.

2901
02:58:35.88 --> 02:58:39.88
After what seems like a long time, I turn and look at the one one.

2902
02:58:39.88 --> 02:58:41.88
His head is down.

2903
02:58:41.88 --> 02:58:43.88
His hands folded in his lap.

2904
02:58:43.88 --> 02:58:46.88
Whiskey tango fox trot over.

2905
02:58:46.88 --> 02:58:48.88
I think to myself.

2906
02:58:48.88 --> 02:58:50.88
Turning back to the debrief panel.

2907
02:58:50.88 --> 02:58:52.88
You ever been ambushed?

2908
02:58:52.88 --> 02:58:54.88
I asked flatly.

2909
02:58:54.88 --> 02:58:59.88
Chief sawing the command sergeant major both shift uncomfortably in their chair.

2910
02:58:59.88 --> 02:59:01.88
None of them have.

2911
02:59:01.88 --> 02:59:05.88
My impatience with this process is giving away to temper.

2912
02:59:05.88 --> 02:59:06.88
I'm tired.

2913
02:59:06.88 --> 02:59:08.88
Remember what Kovie said.

2914
02:59:08.88 --> 02:59:09.88
Keep your cool.

2915
02:59:09.88 --> 02:59:13.88
All these questions have been covered in our initial debrief and documented in the AAR.

2916
02:59:13.88 --> 02:59:14.88
One of these guys after.

2917
02:59:14.88 --> 02:59:18.88
Give them what they want and then get the hell out of here.

2918
02:59:18.88 --> 02:59:20.88
Then he starts speaking again.

2919
02:59:20.88 --> 02:59:24.88
When the NVA triggered the ambush, all that anxiety disappeared.

2920
02:59:24.88 --> 02:59:26.88
I went to work.

2921
02:59:26.88 --> 02:59:29.88
Previous experience and training kicked in.

2922
02:59:29.88 --> 02:59:35.88
I returned fire with the intent of suppressing the NVA attack and being able to maneuver out of the spot we were in.

2923
02:59:35.88 --> 02:59:38.88
Bulldog was bulldog and one one was down.

2924
02:59:38.88 --> 02:59:42.88
Like I said before, I thought he was hit and took charge.

2925
02:59:42.88 --> 02:59:46.88
I've learned the best defense is an aggressive offense.

2926
02:59:46.88 --> 02:59:53.88
As long as we had ammunition and could move, I took charge of our not so little not no name battle.

2927
02:59:53.88 --> 02:59:57.88
Moving at will causing as much confusion for the enemy as possible.

2928
02:59:57.88 --> 03:00:01.88
Preventing them from forming up a large force to overrun us.

2929
03:00:01.88 --> 03:00:05.88
That tactic worked until we ran out of ammo.

2930
03:00:05.88 --> 03:00:09.88
The anxiety returned.

2931
03:00:09.88 --> 03:00:11.88
No sir, fear.

2932
03:00:11.88 --> 03:00:15.88
One one turns to face me with local disbelief.

2933
03:00:15.88 --> 03:00:18.88
How did you deal with it, prompts the doctor?

2934
03:00:18.88 --> 03:00:21.88
Our situation seemed impossible.

2935
03:00:21.88 --> 03:00:24.88
The fact is I was completely overcome with fear.

2936
03:00:24.88 --> 03:00:27.88
For an instant, I couldn't move.

2937
03:00:27.88 --> 03:00:28.88
Many things to himself.

2938
03:00:28.88 --> 03:00:30.88
I haven't found about this until now.

2939
03:00:30.88 --> 03:00:32.88
I don't know if I can express that feeling.

2940
03:00:32.88 --> 03:00:33.88
He continues.

2941
03:00:33.88 --> 03:00:37.88
Oddly, it seemed to be unconnected to the physical danger.

2942
03:00:37.88 --> 03:00:39.88
The fear?

2943
03:00:39.88 --> 03:00:40.88
Yes.

2944
03:00:40.88 --> 03:00:43.88
There were three things going on all at once.

2945
03:00:43.88 --> 03:00:47.88
It was as if I had stepped outside myself.

2946
03:00:47.88 --> 03:00:52.88
Seeing all things, feeling all emotions, all at the same time.

2947
03:00:52.88 --> 03:00:57.88
In that instant, I became completely demoralized.

2948
03:00:57.88 --> 03:00:59.88
Maybe think of himself.

2949
03:00:59.88 --> 03:01:02.88
Every person in this room is fixed on what I am saying.

2950
03:01:02.88 --> 03:01:04.88
I wish I knew what I was saying or how to say.

2951
03:01:04.88 --> 03:01:09.88
I'm talking like a woman or like the shrink.

2952
03:01:09.88 --> 03:01:14.88
Demoralized the doc gently urges.

2953
03:01:14.88 --> 03:01:21.88
What made the emotion so overpowering was the realization that I had violated every moral precept of my upbringing.

2954
03:01:21.88 --> 03:01:25.88
My childhood focused sharply blending into the present.

2955
03:01:25.88 --> 03:01:28.88
I couldn't wrap my mind around our deeds.

2956
03:01:28.88 --> 03:01:29.88
I was alive.

2957
03:01:29.88 --> 03:01:30.88
We were alive.

2958
03:01:30.88 --> 03:01:32.88
Hundreds of others were dead.

2959
03:01:32.88 --> 03:01:34.88
Fathers, sons, husbands.

2960
03:01:34.88 --> 03:01:36.88
You know, more would die.

2961
03:01:36.88 --> 03:01:38.88
Maybe thousands.

2962
03:01:38.88 --> 03:01:45.88
I raised my hand a hold off for other questions as I stared down at the table to focus my thoughts and emotions.

2963
03:01:45.88 --> 03:01:46.88
Emotions.

2964
03:01:46.88 --> 03:01:47.88
Here they are.

2965
03:01:47.88 --> 03:01:48.88
That he continues.

2966
03:01:48.88 --> 03:01:54.88
That entire thought process lasted a fraction of a second.

2967
03:01:54.88 --> 03:01:56.88
Then the usual.

2968
03:01:56.88 --> 03:02:06.88
If I can call it that the reemergence of our deadly danger, the possibility of a sudden assault and total annihilation was welcome.

2969
03:02:06.88 --> 03:02:09.88
And composing reality pacified me.

2970
03:02:09.88 --> 03:02:13.88
Our reality emerged in my mind like a clapped of thunder.

2971
03:02:13.88 --> 03:02:17.88
My emotions were out prioritized by mortality.

2972
03:02:17.88 --> 03:02:21.88
You might want to talk with this.

2973
03:02:21.88 --> 03:02:26.88
You might want to talk with one of our medical staff.

2974
03:02:26.88 --> 03:02:29.88
Offers the chief's dog.

2975
03:02:29.88 --> 03:02:31.88
And he thinks I just did.

2976
03:02:31.88 --> 03:02:32.88
There's nothing they can do for me.

2977
03:02:32.88 --> 03:02:34.88
Ignoring his comment.

2978
03:02:34.88 --> 03:02:38.88
It's interesting to watch the changes in people who are on the spot.

2979
03:02:38.88 --> 03:02:46.88
For instance, in that fraction of a second, when the concussion grenade hit me, I became interesting to myself.

2980
03:02:46.88 --> 03:02:48.88
What does that mean?

2981
03:02:48.88 --> 03:02:51.88
Interested in yourself, the medical officer is surprised.

2982
03:02:51.88 --> 03:02:55.88
Not interested in myself, but interesting to myself.

2983
03:02:55.88 --> 03:02:59.88
An objective interest outside myself.

2984
03:02:59.88 --> 03:03:01.88
It's difficult to describe.

2985
03:03:01.88 --> 03:03:03.88
However, all that serves no purpose in the moment.

2986
03:03:03.88 --> 03:03:07.88
Distractions of that kind prevent us from witnessing our own death.

2987
03:03:07.88 --> 03:03:10.88
From dealing with the present.

2988
03:03:10.88 --> 03:03:14.88
Someone on the team mentioned surrendering.

2989
03:03:14.88 --> 03:03:18.88
We all knew they would kill us.

2990
03:03:18.88 --> 03:03:21.88
Good thinking offers the command sergeant major.

2991
03:03:21.88 --> 03:03:26.88
Anyway, that led to a conversation about breaking the team into two man groups to escape and evade.

2992
03:03:26.88 --> 03:03:31.88
At that point, in the battle, we felt the terrain and enemy activity prevented us from E&D.

2993
03:03:31.88 --> 03:03:40.88
That's when we decided to fight it out using their weapons during daylight hours and then try to get some of the people out under the cover of darkness.

2994
03:03:40.88 --> 03:03:43.88
We now had options and resolve.

2995
03:03:43.88 --> 03:03:50.88
The fear was diminished and a new purpose and mission had gripped every man on the team.

2996
03:03:50.88 --> 03:03:54.88
Explain, orders the lieutenant analyst.

2997
03:03:54.88 --> 03:03:56.88
I thought I just did.

2998
03:03:56.88 --> 03:04:01.88
Blackjack, chides the sergeant major, okay, okay, I hesitate looking for the words.

2999
03:04:01.88 --> 03:04:08.88
During daylight hours, we decided to fight them as hard as we could using their weapons and tactics.

3000
03:04:08.88 --> 03:04:15.88
I know from experience that when you use the enemy's tactics against them, they quickly become confused.

3001
03:04:15.88 --> 03:04:19.88
Have you ever considered countermeasures against your own tactics?

3002
03:04:19.88 --> 03:04:21.88
Of course not, no one ever does.

3003
03:04:21.88 --> 03:04:23.88
You're not going to fight yourself, right?

3004
03:04:23.88 --> 03:04:30.88
That's why it's so important for us to study their tactics and use those tactics against them in the field.

3005
03:04:30.88 --> 03:04:37.88
The report's side gone send out each month are the basis for that knowledge along with what we learned directly in the field.

3006
03:04:37.88 --> 03:04:39.88
Practical experience.

3007
03:04:39.88 --> 03:04:44.88
You all are here making a major contribution to ush staying alive and being successful.

3008
03:04:44.88 --> 03:04:49.88
What you have told me about being trams today adds to that knowledge.

3009
03:04:49.88 --> 03:04:54.88
They're smiling, shooting approval glances at one another.

3010
03:04:54.88 --> 03:04:59.88
In anything so himself, Blackjack, you're being a kiss ass knock it off.

3011
03:04:59.88 --> 03:05:03.88
Thank you, Specialist Black, for the performance review of my staff,

3012
03:05:03.88 --> 03:05:07.88
for the chief's song with the straight face, please continue.

3013
03:05:07.88 --> 03:05:10.88
Instantly they all get serious.

3014
03:05:10.88 --> 03:05:13.88
All we had to do was hold out until dark.

3015
03:05:13.88 --> 03:05:17.88
What about the B-52 strike that was on the way, Mox, the Lieutenant Analyst,

3016
03:05:17.88 --> 03:05:19.88
Minor consideration.

3017
03:05:19.88 --> 03:05:23.88
If thousands of enemy couldn't kill us 20 feet from 20 feet away,

3018
03:05:23.88 --> 03:05:28.88
we could certainly live through B-52's bombing from 20 or 30,000 feet.

3019
03:05:28.88 --> 03:05:31.88
The LT gives me his narrowed, I'd.

3020
03:05:31.88 --> 03:05:38.88
Narrow-eyed, I don't believe you look as the medical officer and others suppress their laughter.

3021
03:05:38.88 --> 03:05:42.88
We begin to pair up as the curtain of death fell around us,

3022
03:05:42.88 --> 03:05:44.88
even though we were still acting as a team.

3023
03:05:44.88 --> 03:05:47.88
Curtin of death asks the medical officer,

3024
03:05:47.88 --> 03:05:50.88
I remember that when the decision was made,

3025
03:05:50.88 --> 03:05:55.88
I felt as if a black curtain were being lowered around me.

3026
03:05:55.88 --> 03:05:57.88
It was something I could see in my mind.

3027
03:05:57.88 --> 03:06:01.88
We made it every attempt to maneuver ourselves into an E&E launch position,

3028
03:06:01.88 --> 03:06:05.88
which turned out to be the route we took to the last Jolly Green Giant.

3029
03:06:05.88 --> 03:06:10.88
We figured, because we were small and they were so large at night,

3030
03:06:10.88 --> 03:06:14.88
we would have to set up blocking positions and not move on us.

3031
03:06:14.88 --> 03:06:16.88
The reasoning was that if they tried to move,

3032
03:06:16.88 --> 03:06:17.88
they would wind up shooting each other.

3033
03:06:17.88 --> 03:06:21.88
In large blocking groups, they would make noise revealing themselves and their positions.

3034
03:06:21.88 --> 03:06:26.88
This would give us the opportunity to try and move out between those positions and get out.

3035
03:06:26.88 --> 03:06:30.88
It's a good thing we didn't have to E&E at night using that route.

3036
03:06:30.88 --> 03:06:32.88
It would have led us directly into the heart of their camp.

3037
03:06:32.88 --> 03:06:39.88
My job became getting as many of my team off the battlefield and out of the AO2 safety as possible.

3038
03:06:42.88 --> 03:06:45.88
Black your Alabama team is very lucky you didn't have to E&E,

3039
03:06:45.88 --> 03:06:48.88
because the B52 strikes even if you survived them,

3040
03:06:48.88 --> 03:06:51.88
the NVA would have taken to widely dispersing its units.

3041
03:06:51.88 --> 03:06:54.88
For instance, a 2000 man NVA regimen might spread,

3042
03:06:54.88 --> 03:06:58.88
might be spread across a five mile stretch of trail,

3043
03:06:58.88 --> 03:07:02.88
dug in into each bend in the road and hilltop.

3044
03:07:02.88 --> 03:07:05.88
This is by the way of explaining.

3045
03:07:05.88 --> 03:07:11.88
This is by the way of explaining why some sog teams just vanish.

3046
03:07:11.88 --> 03:07:16.88
On wittingly landing a mid, such an overlapping concentration of NVA forces.

3047
03:07:16.88 --> 03:07:20.88
My guess is that no matter which way you would have turned every half mile or so,

3048
03:07:20.88 --> 03:07:23.88
you would have bumped into enemy platoons or companies.

3049
03:07:23.88 --> 03:07:26.88
Even 500 man battalions.

3050
03:07:28.88 --> 03:07:31.88
Looking directly at chief sag.

3051
03:07:31.88 --> 03:07:36.88
Did you know they were all there at that place we chose as an LZ.

3052
03:07:36.88 --> 03:07:39.88
Without hesitation he responds.

3053
03:07:39.88 --> 03:07:42.88
So you got Lynn saying wait a second bro.

3054
03:07:42.88 --> 03:07:47.88
You knew that there was all these people on the freaking ground that we were going to put into NLZ.

3055
03:07:47.88 --> 03:07:50.88
And the chief sag says no not specifically.

3056
03:07:50.88 --> 03:07:54.88
The 12 teams before Alabama were tracking regimen down the trail.

3057
03:07:54.88 --> 03:07:58.88
That tracking mission as you know became known as the lottery.

3058
03:07:58.88 --> 03:08:02.88
We believe you found that regimen and bin tram.

3059
03:08:02.88 --> 03:08:05.88
Those are these organizations that protect the Ho Chi Minh Trail.

3060
03:08:05.88 --> 03:08:08.88
Bin tram 611 at that same location.

3061
03:08:08.88 --> 03:08:13.88
Our intelligence led us to believe that your LZ was approximately five miles from that base.

3062
03:08:13.88 --> 03:08:18.88
And that Alabama might have a chance at gathering very important in the intel along the network of trails.

3063
03:08:18.88 --> 03:08:20.88
And also prevalent in that area.

3064
03:08:20.88 --> 03:08:23.88
The fact is we now know exactly where bin tram.

3065
03:08:23.88 --> 03:08:29.88
Bin tram 611 was located and you have confirmed the type of number of personnel on site.

3066
03:08:29.88 --> 03:08:35.88
Rarely as such a small team engaged such a large force with so few casualties and lived to tell about it.

3067
03:08:35.88 --> 03:08:40.88
The bin tram 611 you all encountered has been destroyed.

3068
03:08:40.88 --> 03:08:45.88
For now along with the regimen that took 12 sag teams.

3069
03:08:45.88 --> 03:08:54.88
We hear our all very proud to work with men like you and your Alabama team.

3070
03:08:54.88 --> 03:08:57.88
Blackjack is there anything else you want to say?

3071
03:08:57.88 --> 03:09:01.88
Ask Sergeant Analyst anything at all.

3072
03:09:01.88 --> 03:09:03.88
Yes.

3073
03:09:03.88 --> 03:09:06.88
The jolly green giants.

3074
03:09:06.88 --> 03:09:10.88
The motto painted on the sides of their ships.

3075
03:09:10.88 --> 03:09:14.88
So that others may live.

3076
03:09:14.88 --> 03:09:17.88
Emotion wells up.

3077
03:09:17.88 --> 03:09:19.88
Give me a minute please.

3078
03:09:19.88 --> 03:09:27.88
The thought of the jajies, the Vietnamese king bees and all the others who have committed their lives to saving Alabama emotionally.

3079
03:09:27.88 --> 03:09:33.88
Indate my senses overpowering my ability to stuff emotions back down.

3080
03:09:33.88 --> 03:09:36.88
My eyes flood with tears.

3081
03:09:36.88 --> 03:09:41.88
We're alive today due to all of you.

3082
03:09:41.88 --> 03:09:46.88
Thank you.

3083
03:09:46.88 --> 03:09:49.88
Amen.

3084
03:09:49.88 --> 03:09:54.88
Man.

3085
03:09:54.88 --> 03:09:56.88
Yeah.

3086
03:09:56.88 --> 03:10:00.88
And by the way, so that right there is page 60.

3087
03:10:00.88 --> 03:10:06.88
That just got us to page 60 of this book of this 300 page book.

3088
03:10:06.88 --> 03:10:09.88
That's one mission.

3089
03:10:09.88 --> 03:10:12.88
One historic sag mission.

3090
03:10:12.88 --> 03:10:15.88
One one mission, one historic mission.

3091
03:10:15.88 --> 03:10:21.88
But a mission that represents another day in sag, which is the same that you guys had.

3092
03:10:21.88 --> 03:10:22.88
Yeah.

3093
03:10:22.88 --> 03:10:23.88
And any like that?

3094
03:10:23.88 --> 03:10:25.88
That was in a special category.

3095
03:10:25.88 --> 03:10:26.88
Yeah.

3096
03:10:26.88 --> 03:10:27.88
Yeah.

3097
03:10:27.88 --> 03:10:30.88
But the, I mean, the set up, that's what you guys did.

3098
03:10:30.88 --> 03:10:32.88
You know, like the set up, hey, we're going to go in there.

3099
03:10:32.88 --> 03:10:34.88
We're going to find out where the bad guys are.

3100
03:10:34.88 --> 03:10:35.88
We're taking the king bees in.

3101
03:10:35.88 --> 03:10:38.88
We'll call for fire support if we get in trouble.

3102
03:10:38.88 --> 03:10:40.88
That was your, that was your model.

3103
03:10:40.88 --> 03:10:42.88
That was your, that was what you guys did.

3104
03:10:42.88 --> 03:10:46.88
Oh, yeah.

3105
03:10:46.88 --> 03:10:52.88
Although if we saw a flag, we would definitely try to get out of here if we could post haste.

3106
03:10:52.88 --> 03:10:54.88
How about when you're taking massive fire on insert?

3107
03:10:54.88 --> 03:10:55.88
What about that one?

3108
03:10:55.88 --> 03:10:57.88
Is that another thing you're going to get shot down?

3109
03:10:57.88 --> 03:10:58.88
It's a good idea.

3110
03:10:58.88 --> 03:11:00.88
Or one of your insert craft gets shot down.

3111
03:11:00.88 --> 03:11:02.88
You say we're going to continue the mission?

3112
03:11:02.88 --> 03:11:03.88
Can you imagine?

3113
03:11:03.88 --> 03:11:04.88
No.

3114
03:11:04.88 --> 03:11:09.88
Hey. Yeah.

3115
03:11:09.88 --> 03:11:14.88
Well, there's a ton of other missions to discuss this book.

3116
03:11:14.88 --> 03:11:18.88
It's called a whiskey tango fox trot written by Lynn Black,

3117
03:11:18.88 --> 03:11:20.88
Jr.

3118
03:11:20.88 --> 03:11:24.88
Just get the book and bunch the other missions there.

3119
03:11:24.88 --> 03:11:26.88
I want to save some of them.

3120
03:11:26.88 --> 03:11:29.88
So hopefully we can get, we can get the man himself on here.

3121
03:11:29.88 --> 03:11:33.88
To talk through some of these, give us his experiences.

3122
03:11:33.88 --> 03:11:37.88
It's also cool because we'll get both of you guys on here because, you know,

3123
03:11:37.88 --> 03:11:40.88
he writes about some of the same missions you guys were on together.

3124
03:11:40.88 --> 03:11:42.88
If you guys both wrote about these missions.

3125
03:11:42.88 --> 03:11:45.88
So to get both you in here to kind of go through those,

3126
03:11:45.88 --> 03:11:49.88
I'll do my job shut up and just let you guys talk, which would be

3127
03:11:49.88 --> 03:11:52.88
freaking awesome, awesome to do.

3128
03:11:52.88 --> 03:11:56.88
But yeah, hopefully we can get them on at some point.

3129
03:11:56.88 --> 03:12:00.88
And if not, then if you can't make it on, then we'll go through some of these other

3130
03:12:00.88 --> 03:12:02.88
stories and share them.

3131
03:12:02.88 --> 03:12:04.88
Most of the honor to pay homage to him.

3132
03:12:04.88 --> 03:12:06.88
He's just a great guy, feelless warrior.

3133
03:12:06.88 --> 03:12:08.88
And some of the things he did in that mission.

3134
03:12:08.88 --> 03:12:10.88
Oh my God.

3135
03:12:10.88 --> 03:12:15.88
When you think about these times, was it seem like a long time ago?

3136
03:12:15.88 --> 03:12:16.88
Or is it seem like yesterday?

3137
03:12:16.88 --> 03:12:19.88
Or, and I'm going to ask you this, does it seem like both?

3138
03:12:19.88 --> 03:12:23.88
Because for me, sometimes my experience seems like it was a long time ago

3139
03:12:23.88 --> 03:12:25.88
and sometimes it seems like it was yesterday.

3140
03:12:25.88 --> 03:12:26.88
What does it seem like to you?

3141
03:12:26.88 --> 03:12:27.88
Oh, it's clearly both.

3142
03:12:27.88 --> 03:12:28.88
Yeah.

3143
03:12:28.88 --> 03:12:29.88
Absolutely.

3144
03:12:29.88 --> 03:12:33.88
I can just remember us standing there at the outside of the

3145
03:12:33.88 --> 03:12:36.88
S3 shop waiting for the go for the bright light.

3146
03:12:36.88 --> 03:12:38.88
Because Don already told us.

3147
03:12:38.88 --> 03:12:42.88
And we were just switching everything out, just nothing but ammo,

3148
03:12:42.88 --> 03:12:45.88
hand grenades and bandages and some body bags.

3149
03:12:45.88 --> 03:12:48.88
And quite glad that they changed the mind.

3150
03:12:48.88 --> 03:12:55.88
And Lynn, again, he had this right tactical decision on the ground.

3151
03:12:55.88 --> 03:12:58.88
And he called it right because if we tried to go in,

3152
03:12:58.88 --> 03:13:00.88
it looked like his.

3153
03:13:00.88 --> 03:13:03.88
The other helicopter shot down and there's more people on the ground more

3154
03:13:03.88 --> 03:13:05.88
casualties possibly.

3155
03:13:05.88 --> 03:13:10.88
And so yeah, so that day comes back every October 5th.

3156
03:13:10.88 --> 03:13:14.88
You know, we have our little email loop, spider, pat walkins.

3157
03:13:14.88 --> 03:13:18.88
And it was go, hey, Lynn, this is your day brother.

3158
03:13:18.88 --> 03:13:23.88
We don't know how you did it, but they were glad you did.

3159
03:13:23.88 --> 03:13:28.88
Yeah, and the fact that, you know, he's he's saying in the beginning when they

3160
03:13:28.88 --> 03:13:31.88
inserted like they should have left immediately.

3161
03:13:31.88 --> 03:13:34.88
Meaning he's kind of looking to save his own ass, right?

3162
03:13:34.88 --> 03:13:35.88
Yeah, sure.

3163
03:13:35.88 --> 03:13:36.88
God bless him.

3164
03:13:36.88 --> 03:13:39.88
But then you fast forward whatever it is a few hours.

3165
03:13:39.88 --> 03:13:42.88
And now he's saying nope, I'm saving everyone else's ass.

3166
03:13:42.88 --> 03:13:43.88
Don't come and get me.

3167
03:13:43.88 --> 03:13:46.88
I mean, that's, hey, don't land your bird.

3168
03:13:46.88 --> 03:13:47.88
He calls off Kingbies.

3169
03:13:47.88 --> 03:13:48.88
Get out of here.

3170
03:13:48.88 --> 03:13:49.88
Don't take off.

3171
03:13:49.88 --> 03:13:50.88
Leave us here.

3172
03:13:50.88 --> 03:13:51.88
Bright light.

3173
03:13:51.88 --> 03:13:52.88
No.

3174
03:13:52.88 --> 03:13:53.88
We're not going to be bait.

3175
03:13:53.88 --> 03:13:54.88
Yeah.

3176
03:13:54.88 --> 03:13:58.88
And you know, when he, when he finally came back to base, like a dare to

3177
03:13:58.88 --> 03:13:59.88
let it go, they had to go patch him up.

3178
03:13:59.88 --> 03:14:04.88
And then they had a little ceremony with the Air Force guys.

3179
03:14:04.88 --> 03:14:07.88
What he swapped for days could the PJs had their brazen.

3180
03:14:07.88 --> 03:14:12.88
I think Lynn and Steve swapped out theirs.

3181
03:14:12.88 --> 03:14:15.88
And we came back to base.

3182
03:14:15.88 --> 03:14:17.88
He never talked about it.

3183
03:14:17.88 --> 03:14:21.88
We, we'd heard about what spider, mandolin, or all sand.

3184
03:14:21.88 --> 03:14:25.88
About the mission, but you know, Lynn wouldn't talk about it.

3185
03:14:25.88 --> 03:14:29.88
So even when I did the book, I had to go back and physically go, come on then.

3186
03:14:29.88 --> 03:14:31.88
I want to get this story into the book.

3187
03:14:31.88 --> 03:14:35.88
I flew up to the 1980, 1990, um, finally interviewed.

3188
03:14:35.88 --> 03:14:39.88
That's where I learned stuff that I never knew about the mission.

3189
03:14:39.88 --> 03:14:42.88
Or just some of the little details about the, um,

3190
03:14:42.88 --> 03:14:46.88
find the PJ cooking, the broken back.

3191
03:14:46.88 --> 03:14:48.88
And oh my god.

3192
03:14:48.88 --> 03:14:53.88
See, it's just an amazing, amazing warrior, great guy, an artist on top of it.

3193
03:14:53.88 --> 03:14:56.88
And, um, when he was talking about the, um,

3194
03:14:56.88 --> 03:15:01.88
Chiefsaw that was Steve Kavenal, who was a highly decorated world where two of that.

3195
03:15:01.88 --> 03:15:04.88
And then when Korea, he was in Germany.

3196
03:15:04.88 --> 03:15:08.88
But then he was Chiefsaw, he came in right after Jack Singlove.

3197
03:15:08.88 --> 03:15:13.88
And his welcome to Saag was August 23rd, 68, and F will be four.

3198
03:15:13.88 --> 03:15:14.88
Yeah.

3199
03:15:14.88 --> 03:15:17.88
So he was a really good Chiefsaw.

3200
03:15:17.88 --> 03:15:19.88
He really cared about the man.

3201
03:15:19.88 --> 03:15:22.88
But, uh, what was his rank as the Chiefsaw?

3202
03:15:22.88 --> 03:15:23.88
Bird, oh six.

3203
03:15:23.88 --> 03:15:25.88
So he was a whole bird colonel.

3204
03:15:25.88 --> 03:15:25.88
Yeah.

3205
03:15:25.88 --> 03:15:29.88
He was in charge of, and he's in charge of all sock.

3206
03:15:29.88 --> 03:15:49.88
C, C, C, C, C, C, C, C, C.

3207
03:15:49.88 --> 03:15:54.88
That's why I loved the book because the link is entities little exchanges back and forth.

3208
03:15:54.88 --> 03:15:57.48
his editorals on my comments with these.

3209
03:15:57.48 --> 03:15:58.32
Oh yes.

3210
03:15:58.32 --> 03:15:59.68
It's so freaking classic.

3211
03:15:59.68 --> 03:16:00.52
It's precious.

3212
03:16:00.52 --> 03:16:02.12
It's crazy because I know you.

3213
03:16:02.12 --> 03:16:03.72
And so I'm reading tilt set this.

3214
03:16:03.72 --> 03:16:04.72
Till it said that.

3215
03:16:04.72 --> 03:16:05.72
Till it's throw this.

3216
03:16:05.72 --> 03:16:07.12
It's so awesome.

3217
03:16:07.12 --> 03:16:08.12
Read.

3218
03:16:08.12 --> 03:16:10.32
Yeah, that's freaking awesome.

3219
03:16:10.32 --> 03:16:14.20
He also, you know, he also breaks into the hole.

3220
03:16:14.20 --> 03:16:20.20
You get a better, you get a very good feeling of the whole kind of deployment when

3221
03:16:20.20 --> 03:16:26.72
he's going into town and he's, there's all kinds of shady kind of CIA stuff going on

3222
03:16:26.72 --> 03:16:28.56
in there that he's wrapped up in.

3223
03:16:28.56 --> 03:16:29.56
Oh yeah.

3224
03:16:29.56 --> 03:16:32.52
That's for, it's like, it's legit.

3225
03:16:32.52 --> 03:16:40.44
Well, and even in the first 60 pages, there are segments there for what he did underfire

3226
03:16:40.44 --> 03:16:44.52
that could be cut out and use any leadership school for the military.

3227
03:16:44.52 --> 03:16:45.52
Anywhere's.

3228
03:16:45.52 --> 03:16:47.24
It's just incredible stuff.

3229
03:16:47.24 --> 03:16:52.20
Yeah, not to mention anything that he did multiple times over could be used to write

3230
03:16:52.20 --> 03:16:55.56
in a word citation or what did he, what did he receive for this?

3231
03:16:55.56 --> 03:16:57.96
Well, he wound up with a silver star.

3232
03:16:57.96 --> 03:16:58.96
Okay.

3233
03:16:58.96 --> 03:17:02.40
Which should have been my opinion, at least a metal of honor.

3234
03:17:02.40 --> 03:17:08.40
And because in the book he goes into a spider and mandolin, or talk a little bit a few days

3235
03:17:08.40 --> 03:17:09.80
later.

3236
03:17:09.80 --> 03:17:17.20
And the S3 officer, a major who will remain nameless, was saying he didn't bring

3237
03:17:17.20 --> 03:17:18.72
back stride.

3238
03:17:18.72 --> 03:17:21.12
So you'd be glad we're putting him in for a silver star.

3239
03:17:21.12 --> 03:17:22.84
And you know, Pat Walk is a spider.

3240
03:17:22.84 --> 03:17:23.84
We're pretty infatient.

3241
03:17:23.84 --> 03:17:26.60
He should have been a lot higher than that.

3242
03:17:26.60 --> 03:17:32.24
And we could think about metal of honor that had been awarded where nothing like what

3243
03:17:32.24 --> 03:17:38.000
then was up against getting knocked out all that time on a job, patched up his own people,

3244
03:17:38.000 --> 03:17:39.44
and then leading them out.

3245
03:17:39.44 --> 03:17:41.88
And then, oh, was this charge right through the NBA ranks?

3246
03:17:41.88 --> 03:17:43.88
Did I use to that?

3247
03:17:43.88 --> 03:17:46.84
Oh my god.

3248
03:17:46.84 --> 03:17:52.04
It's weird because he's definitely a cerebral guy as you could hear from that last

3249
03:17:52.04 --> 03:17:53.04
section.

3250
03:17:53.04 --> 03:17:54.04
Oh yeah.

3251
03:17:54.04 --> 03:17:56.000
But damn, he would get aggressive.

3252
03:17:56.000 --> 03:17:57.88
I mean, he's pissed off.

3253
03:17:57.88 --> 03:18:02.12
That's kind of one of the recent he read in Lysons, because he's pissed off that they wound

3254
03:18:02.12 --> 03:18:06.08
his brother and wounded people from the 173rd and killed people from the 173rd.

3255
03:18:06.08 --> 03:18:08.000
So he's got this pent up aggression.

3256
03:18:08.000 --> 03:18:09.40
But then he's an artist.

3257
03:18:09.40 --> 03:18:10.40
Oh yeah.

3258
03:18:10.40 --> 03:18:11.40
Right.

3259
03:18:11.40 --> 03:18:12.40
Sure.

3260
03:18:12.40 --> 03:18:14.12
He worked at this TV station during high school.

3261
03:18:14.12 --> 03:18:15.84
He's so good.

3262
03:18:15.84 --> 03:18:19.28
But I'm one of, you know, we've just read it.

3263
03:18:19.28 --> 03:18:25.16
So, and then years later, I mean, he just comes back in his own way and it goes, gets

3264
03:18:25.16 --> 03:18:30.24
a job at Boeing, rises through the ranks, this incredible work there that nobody could

3265
03:18:30.24 --> 03:18:31.24
talk about.

3266
03:18:31.24 --> 03:18:32.24
Oh yeah.

3267
03:18:32.24 --> 03:18:39.24
One of our saga legends through the max and humble, the modest.

3268
03:18:39.24 --> 03:18:42.48
He just like pulling teeth and getting to talk about it.

3269
03:18:42.48 --> 03:18:43.48
Yeah.

3270
03:18:43.48 --> 03:18:44.48
That's why I love the book.

3271
03:18:44.48 --> 03:18:47.68
You know, every couple years saw a port out and we read it.

3272
03:18:47.68 --> 03:18:51.40
Did you know what inspired him to write this book?

3273
03:18:51.40 --> 03:18:52.40
That's a good question.

3274
03:18:52.40 --> 03:18:54.40
I don't know.

3275
03:18:54.40 --> 03:19:02.60
These last 15 years, so between the reunions and being so far apart, I was just, everybody

3276
03:19:02.60 --> 03:19:05.24
was talking to a C'mon, they got to the book.

3277
03:19:05.24 --> 03:19:09.92
And at one point, he told him, he threw away four to 500 pages.

3278
03:19:09.92 --> 03:19:14.44
That's a little bit of a little folder.

3279
03:19:14.44 --> 03:19:21.32
So somewhere, given to me, given to somebody, a bit of a nice, a nice, no, it's done.

3280
03:19:21.32 --> 03:19:23.60
He worked on for a while.

3281
03:19:23.60 --> 03:19:25.24
He really did.

3282
03:19:25.24 --> 03:19:29.76
And we had chatted back and forth back when I still had the newspaper back in the day.

3283
03:19:29.76 --> 03:19:33.88
Well, it's a phenomenal book.

3284
03:19:33.88 --> 03:19:35.72
I hope everybody goes to pick it up.

3285
03:19:35.72 --> 03:19:39.44
Hopefully you can come on here and talk through some of these stories.

3286
03:19:39.44 --> 03:19:43.08
And if not that, then hopefully I can just go shake his hand one day because it'd be

3287
03:19:43.08 --> 03:19:44.08
an honor.

3288
03:19:44.08 --> 03:19:48.000
Next time you go up to Seattle, where you're going to use your show.

3289
03:19:48.000 --> 03:19:49.000
Yeah.

3290
03:19:49.000 --> 03:19:51.40
Yeah.

3291
03:19:51.40 --> 03:19:54.60
With that look, we've been going for three and a half hours or something like that.

3292
03:19:54.60 --> 03:19:55.60
Really?

3293
03:19:55.60 --> 03:19:56.60
Yeah.

3294
03:19:56.60 --> 03:19:57.60
I know.

3295
03:19:57.60 --> 03:20:01.84
This must be a jockel podcast.

3296
03:20:01.84 --> 03:20:04.60
Critter asked in me.

3297
03:20:04.60 --> 03:20:05.60
Yeah.

3298
03:20:05.60 --> 03:20:11.40
And we're going to come back, reduce some song chronicles next.

3299
03:20:11.40 --> 03:20:13.76
Yeah.

3300
03:20:13.76 --> 03:20:19.96
Until then, a little bit speechless, but it's the obvious it's an honor to share these

3301
03:20:19.96 --> 03:20:21.80
stories, these socks stories.

3302
03:20:21.80 --> 03:20:25.96
It's an honor always to have you until an honor to know you.

3303
03:20:25.96 --> 03:20:31.36
And it's an honor for me to help get the word out, get the word out about you and your

3304
03:20:31.36 --> 03:20:33.36
brothers in song.

3305
03:20:33.36 --> 03:20:38.32
Your books that you've written that we've covered on the podcast across the fence.

3306
03:20:38.32 --> 03:20:42.000
I've got the first one on the ground.

3307
03:20:42.000 --> 03:20:49.24
And then, sog chronicles volume one, you're also out there just getting after the social

3308
03:20:49.24 --> 03:20:50.24
media.

3309
03:20:50.24 --> 03:20:51.24
A little bit now.

3310
03:20:51.24 --> 03:20:54.52
I get the Tennessee, we're going to be moving here real soon.

3311
03:20:54.52 --> 03:20:55.76
That's going to get really serious.

3312
03:20:55.76 --> 03:20:59.88
I'll be calling up back, though, for some skill sets.

3313
03:20:59.88 --> 03:21:03.72
You're on Twitter, but you don't do much on Twitter.

3314
03:21:03.72 --> 03:21:05.28
Minimal on Twitter.

3315
03:21:05.28 --> 03:21:07.76
On Twitter, you're at Sog John.

3316
03:21:07.76 --> 03:21:09.56
Does that want to end up in there?

3317
03:21:09.56 --> 03:21:10.80
And then there's at sog chronicles.

3318
03:21:10.80 --> 03:21:12.84
Jay Striker, okay.

3319
03:21:12.84 --> 03:21:13.84
Myr.

3320
03:21:13.84 --> 03:21:15.24
That's the other handle.

3321
03:21:15.24 --> 03:21:16.48
But, sit this as Twitter.

3322
03:21:16.48 --> 03:21:17.96
And do you think I should really be on it?

3323
03:21:17.96 --> 03:21:19.76
You have to give me a more advice here.

3324
03:21:19.76 --> 03:21:22.32
I don't want to do it, I guess.

3325
03:21:22.32 --> 03:21:24.32
Instagram has been amazing.

3326
03:21:24.32 --> 03:21:25.32
Yeah, no.

3327
03:21:25.32 --> 03:21:27.92
That's so I was going to say Jay Striker Myr on Instagram.

3328
03:21:27.92 --> 03:21:29.52
That's where you're at.

3329
03:21:29.52 --> 03:21:36.24
You also have Facebook, John Striker Myr, and you have on the internet, on the inner webs,

3330
03:21:36.24 --> 03:21:41.000
on your app, or it's just Sog Chronicles.com.

3331
03:21:41.000 --> 03:21:42.000
Correct.

3332
03:21:42.000 --> 03:21:46.84
And we're going to be going to get my 20th-th-th-thew websites going to be upgraded here

3333
03:21:46.84 --> 03:21:47.84
to the next month or two.

3334
03:21:47.84 --> 03:21:50.24
Look like you designed that one on a tape recorder.

3335
03:21:50.24 --> 03:21:53.84
It wasn't that advanced, y'all.

3336
03:21:53.84 --> 03:21:57.36
My doors are on me and Anazon be too.

3337
03:21:57.36 --> 03:21:59.12
So we're lined up at gentlemen now.

3338
03:21:59.12 --> 03:22:01.60
We're going to review them to come back in the redesign.

3339
03:22:01.60 --> 03:22:02.60
Absolutely.

3340
03:22:02.60 --> 03:22:06.20
Well, like I said, thank you so much for coming.

3341
03:22:06.20 --> 03:22:07.20
I'm on my pleasure.

3342
03:22:07.20 --> 03:22:10.36
And I'll always an honor, appreciate it.

3343
03:22:10.36 --> 03:22:14.84
And it's just, every time you send me a text message that says Airborne, it gives me enough

3344
03:22:14.84 --> 03:22:18.96
motivation to get through like six weeks of mayhem.

3345
03:22:18.96 --> 03:22:20.96
That's pretty good.

3346
03:22:20.96 --> 03:22:25.48
Until next time, Airborne indeed.

3347
03:22:25.48 --> 03:22:32.28
And with that John Striker Myr, till has left the building.

3348
03:22:32.28 --> 03:22:38.60
You know, echo, it's, you know, we're sitting here.

3349
03:22:38.60 --> 03:22:41.20
And sometimes we feel like maybe we're getting after it.

3350
03:22:41.20 --> 03:22:44.72
And then you sit down with someone like Tilt.

3351
03:22:44.72 --> 03:22:49.04
And you hear the story of Lim Black and the guy's from Saga.

3352
03:22:49.04 --> 03:22:54.16
And it makes me realize that we can do more.

3353
03:22:54.16 --> 03:22:59.52
And we actually should do more with our lives.

3354
03:22:59.52 --> 03:23:02.28
To get after it more.

3355
03:23:02.28 --> 03:23:11.24
So what recommendations do you have to keep us in the mode of getting after it as we pursue

3356
03:23:11.24 --> 03:23:14.52
as we pursue.

3357
03:23:14.52 --> 03:23:15.52
Improvement.

3358
03:23:15.52 --> 03:23:16.52
Yeah, improvement.

3359
03:23:16.52 --> 03:23:21.40
I just wanted to say, as we improve as we pursue an unattainable standard.

3360
03:23:21.40 --> 03:23:22.40
Yes.

3361
03:23:22.40 --> 03:23:23.56
It's an unattainable standard.

3362
03:23:23.56 --> 03:23:25.44
I'm not ever.

3363
03:23:25.44 --> 03:23:28.88
I mean, something would have to go completely haywire for me to get after it to the level

3364
03:23:28.88 --> 03:23:35.48
of a John Striker Myr or of a Lynn Black or of a Dick Thompson.

3365
03:23:35.48 --> 03:23:38.28
There'd have to be there's some's got to go majorly wrong.

3366
03:23:38.28 --> 03:23:41.96
So and I don't, you look, we hope that doesn't happen in the world.

3367
03:23:41.96 --> 03:23:46.64
So what we are in the pursuit of that level, we're not going to get there.

3368
03:23:46.64 --> 03:23:47.64
But we're trying.

3369
03:23:47.64 --> 03:23:48.64
Yes.

3370
03:23:48.64 --> 03:23:52.32
Because we're not just going to sit back and say, oh, they got after it more than me.

3371
03:23:52.32 --> 03:23:53.80
I'm just going to sit on the couch.

3372
03:23:53.80 --> 03:23:54.80
No, no.

3373
03:23:54.80 --> 03:23:55.80
We're not doing that.

3374
03:23:55.80 --> 03:23:56.80
No.

3375
03:23:56.80 --> 03:24:00.32
We're going to get after it.

3376
03:24:00.32 --> 03:24:05.24
Appropriate at the appropriate level to our world.

3377
03:24:05.24 --> 03:24:06.24
Anyway.

3378
03:24:06.24 --> 03:24:07.24
Okay.

3379
03:24:07.24 --> 03:24:08.24
We do.

3380
03:24:08.24 --> 03:24:12.24
I like the fact that you finally came to yourself realization of what you just said

3381
03:24:12.24 --> 03:24:13.24
made no sense.

3382
03:24:13.24 --> 03:24:14.24
It doesn't do that.

3383
03:24:14.24 --> 03:24:16.24
You don't get that self realization very often.

3384
03:24:16.24 --> 03:24:17.24
It makes sense.

3385
03:24:17.24 --> 03:24:18.24
You just got to think about it.

3386
03:24:18.24 --> 03:24:19.24
That's just got to think about it more.

3387
03:24:19.24 --> 03:24:20.24
Anyway.

3388
03:24:20.24 --> 03:24:22.36
So yes, we're working out our bodies.

3389
03:24:22.36 --> 03:24:23.80
Degeneration regeneration.

3390
03:24:23.80 --> 03:24:26.76
As you said, why is man, Jocco?

3391
03:24:26.76 --> 03:24:27.76
Why is man?

3392
03:24:27.76 --> 03:24:28.76
I'm saying it.

3393
03:24:28.76 --> 03:24:30.76
There you go, boom.

3394
03:24:30.76 --> 03:24:34.48
The beatings are the darkness.

3395
03:24:34.48 --> 03:24:36.000
The gains are the light.

3396
03:24:36.000 --> 03:24:37.96
So, Jocco fuel.

3397
03:24:37.96 --> 03:24:38.96
This will help you.

3398
03:24:38.96 --> 03:24:40.32
These things will help you.

3399
03:24:40.32 --> 03:24:41.32
Jocco fuel.

3400
03:24:41.32 --> 03:24:42.32
We've got stuff for your joints.

3401
03:24:42.32 --> 03:24:43.32
Stuff for your muscles.

3402
03:24:43.32 --> 03:24:45.24
Stuff for your brain.

3403
03:24:45.24 --> 03:24:47.60
Stuff for your immunity.

3404
03:24:47.60 --> 03:24:48.60
All the stuff.

3405
03:24:48.60 --> 03:24:49.60
Some bases.

3406
03:24:49.60 --> 03:24:50.60
You got some bases covered.

3407
03:24:50.60 --> 03:24:51.60
Yes, sir.

3408
03:24:51.60 --> 03:24:52.60
Yes, we do.

3409
03:24:52.60 --> 03:24:54.68
Anyway, join warfare and cruel oil.

3410
03:24:54.68 --> 03:24:55.68
These are for your joints.

3411
03:24:55.68 --> 03:24:58.44
They're oxidants in there too, by the way.

3412
03:24:58.44 --> 03:25:09.12
Also discipline, multiple forms, deployment methods, powder, mixable in water, recommended.

3413
03:25:09.12 --> 03:25:11.28
Maybe throw some juice in there.

3414
03:25:11.28 --> 03:25:12.28
No.

3415
03:25:12.28 --> 03:25:14.52
All right, well, hey, I was just seeing it.

3416
03:25:14.52 --> 03:25:15.52
You don't need to throw it in there.

3417
03:25:15.52 --> 03:25:16.52
I know that.

3418
03:25:16.52 --> 03:25:21.000
I mixed one up the other day because it was been hot here in the California AO.

3419
03:25:21.000 --> 03:25:23.000
And we have operations.

3420
03:25:23.000 --> 03:25:25.16
And did you see what I posted it?

3421
03:25:25.16 --> 03:25:27.16
I mixed up.

3422
03:25:27.16 --> 03:25:30.24
I took just, you know, well, I don't know if you know this.

3423
03:25:30.24 --> 03:25:38.04
When it's hot out, IST, Arnold Palmer, scenarios are very nice staff.

3424
03:25:38.04 --> 03:25:40.72
So you know this, you ever seen one of those big?

3425
03:25:40.72 --> 03:25:43.24
Basically, this is a big picture.

3426
03:25:43.24 --> 03:25:44.24
You know what a picture is?

3427
03:25:44.24 --> 03:25:45.24
Yes.

3428
03:25:45.24 --> 03:25:47.40
It's a clear plastic picture.

3429
03:25:47.40 --> 03:25:49.80
And there's only one true purpose for that thing.

3430
03:25:49.80 --> 03:25:55.12
And that is to mix up IST or Arnold Palmer on a hot, hot day.

3431
03:25:55.12 --> 03:26:01.20
So I did it empty my IST thing into there, put in the jockel Palmer discipline go.

3432
03:26:01.20 --> 03:26:02.20
What they can?

3433
03:26:02.20 --> 03:26:03.20
No, no, no, the powder.

3434
03:26:03.20 --> 03:26:04.84
That's not discipline go.

3435
03:26:04.84 --> 03:26:06.84
Put in the discipline powder.

3436
03:26:06.84 --> 03:26:07.84
You.

3437
03:26:07.84 --> 03:26:08.84
You was so good.

3438
03:26:08.84 --> 03:26:09.84
It was nice.

3439
03:26:09.84 --> 03:26:10.84
You're so good.

3440
03:26:10.84 --> 03:26:13.36
Yeah, so you got the Arnold Palmer, jockel Palmer.

3441
03:26:13.36 --> 03:26:17.24
You got the Arnold Palmer feel with the jockel Palmer feel.

3442
03:26:17.24 --> 03:26:18.24
You see what I'm saying?

3443
03:26:18.24 --> 03:26:19.24
I think it man.

3444
03:26:19.24 --> 03:26:20.24
I think it's a bad mix.

3445
03:26:20.24 --> 03:26:21.24
You know what?

3446
03:26:21.24 --> 03:26:22.24
It didn't make any sense.

3447
03:26:22.24 --> 03:26:23.24
It didn't make any sense.

3448
03:26:23.24 --> 03:26:24.24
Yeah, it's sense.

3449
03:26:24.24 --> 03:26:26.24
See that's what I'm talking about.

3450
03:26:26.24 --> 03:26:28.48
So why had to do was think about it.

3451
03:26:28.48 --> 03:26:30.68
Hey, look, I'm not this one up guy.

3452
03:26:30.68 --> 03:26:32.88
You know, you know, you know what a one up guy is.

3453
03:26:32.88 --> 03:26:34.24
I'm not that.

3454
03:26:34.24 --> 03:26:37.80
And I'm not a grammar Nazi and I'm not a character.

3455
03:26:37.80 --> 03:26:38.80
Okay.

3456
03:26:38.80 --> 03:26:41.16
I'll correct you if you want me just corrected me.

3457
03:26:41.16 --> 03:26:42.16
I'll just go.

3458
03:26:42.16 --> 03:26:43.16
But okay, whatever.

3459
03:26:43.16 --> 03:26:44.16
Yeah, you weird self image.

3460
03:26:44.16 --> 03:26:47.68
That's kind of why I kind of said it because I might have came off like a character

3461
03:26:47.68 --> 03:26:50.24
and I might come off like a little bit of a character right now.

3462
03:26:50.24 --> 03:26:54.000
But technically you have a picture hot summertime.

3463
03:26:54.000 --> 03:26:55.44
California heat wave weekend.

3464
03:26:55.44 --> 03:26:57.000
That's kind of what it was.

3465
03:26:57.000 --> 03:26:59.56
You want a glass picture?

3466
03:26:59.56 --> 03:27:00.56
No, not a glass.

3467
03:27:00.56 --> 03:27:01.56
Yeah, yeah.

3468
03:27:01.56 --> 03:27:02.56
I do.

3469
03:27:02.56 --> 03:27:03.56
I don't know.

3470
03:27:03.56 --> 03:27:05.04
Yeah, no, I agree with you.

3471
03:27:05.04 --> 03:27:06.04
There you go.

3472
03:27:06.04 --> 03:27:08.52
I don't purchase the pictures in my house.

3473
03:27:08.52 --> 03:27:09.52
There you go.

3474
03:27:09.52 --> 03:27:12.12
Other people run that part of the machine.

3475
03:27:12.12 --> 03:27:13.12
Yeah.

3476
03:27:13.12 --> 03:27:14.12
No worries.

3477
03:27:14.12 --> 03:27:15.12
We'll get some people on the phone.

3478
03:27:15.12 --> 03:27:16.12
We'll sort it out.

3479
03:27:16.12 --> 03:27:17.12
All good.

3480
03:27:17.12 --> 03:27:18.12
Good luck with that.

3481
03:27:18.12 --> 03:27:19.12
Yes, sir.

3482
03:27:19.12 --> 03:27:20.12
Yes, sir.

3483
03:27:20.12 --> 03:27:23.32
Either way, again, things for immunity, vitamin D and cold war.

3484
03:27:23.32 --> 03:27:25.64
But it's two things, different methodologies.

3485
03:27:25.64 --> 03:27:27.56
But immune support.

3486
03:27:27.56 --> 03:27:29.36
Yeah, I get on that for sure.

3487
03:27:29.36 --> 03:27:32.16
Because in these times immunity is always a good thing.

3488
03:27:32.16 --> 03:27:33.36
It's never a bad thing.

3489
03:27:33.36 --> 03:27:34.36
Immunity.

3490
03:27:34.36 --> 03:27:35.36
Yes, for example.

3491
03:27:35.36 --> 03:27:36.36
You know, that's a good thing.

3492
03:27:36.36 --> 03:27:37.36
Does it?

3493
03:27:37.36 --> 03:27:38.36
Yeah.

3494
03:27:38.36 --> 03:27:39.36
Does it being able to drink?

3495
03:27:39.36 --> 03:27:44.52
You eat a nice red eye or a nice piece of elk and you're like, oh, that was so good.

3496
03:27:44.52 --> 03:27:49.64
But there's still a little something in your weird brain that wants dessert.

3497
03:27:49.64 --> 03:27:52.24
Yeah, which is why we make milk.

3498
03:27:52.24 --> 03:27:53.24
Yes.

3499
03:27:53.24 --> 03:27:54.24
You can get dessert for you.

3500
03:27:54.24 --> 03:27:55.24
Yep.

3501
03:27:55.24 --> 03:27:57.24
And you can just have a dessert.

3502
03:27:57.24 --> 03:27:58.24
Shortcake.

3503
03:27:58.24 --> 03:27:59.24
You can have ice cream.

3504
03:27:59.24 --> 03:28:00.44
You can have carrot cake.

3505
03:28:00.44 --> 03:28:05.16
You could have chocolate pudding or you could have milk.

3506
03:28:05.16 --> 03:28:12.04
It all tastes the same genre of food, except for all those things are bad for you,

3507
03:28:12.04 --> 03:28:14.24
except milk, which is literally good for you.

3508
03:28:14.24 --> 03:28:15.24
Literally good for you.

3509
03:28:15.24 --> 03:28:17.56
And I'll supply you with additional protein.

3510
03:28:17.56 --> 03:28:20.40
You think a cake is going to give you more protein or regular cake.

3511
03:28:20.40 --> 03:28:22.92
We will go toe to toe cake versus bowl.

3512
03:28:22.92 --> 03:28:28.64
Here, all taste, taste and protein levels.

3513
03:28:28.64 --> 03:28:29.64
All day.

3514
03:28:29.64 --> 03:28:30.64
So yeah, I get that one.

3515
03:28:30.64 --> 03:28:34.08
Now, your kids are going to like it too, whether it's that one or the where your

3516
03:28:34.08 --> 03:28:35.64
kid mall which there is.

3517
03:28:35.64 --> 03:28:36.64
Yeah.

3518
03:28:36.64 --> 03:28:37.64
Because it's going to like both of those.

3519
03:28:37.64 --> 03:28:40.32
I know from experience kids like this.

3520
03:28:40.32 --> 03:28:43.16
I know from experience kids love this.

3521
03:28:43.16 --> 03:28:44.16
Stop.

3522
03:28:44.16 --> 03:28:45.16
Yes, sir.

3523
03:28:45.16 --> 03:28:46.16
It's true.

3524
03:28:46.16 --> 03:28:47.16
It's all true.

3525
03:28:47.16 --> 03:28:48.16
Also, jocco IT.

3526
03:28:48.16 --> 03:28:49.16
Yes.

3527
03:28:49.16 --> 03:28:51.16
You know the refreshing tea scenario.

3528
03:28:51.16 --> 03:28:53.88
Anyway, you can get all this stuff at the right amount of shop if you want to go out

3529
03:28:53.88 --> 03:28:54.88
and get some.

3530
03:28:54.88 --> 03:28:57.48
Also, if you don't want to go out and get some just online.

3531
03:28:57.48 --> 03:28:59.52
Origin, main.com.

3532
03:28:59.52 --> 03:29:00.88
That's where you get it.

3533
03:29:00.88 --> 03:29:06.08
Also, at origin, main.com, you can get American made products straight up.

3534
03:29:06.08 --> 03:29:07.92
American made hard goods.

3535
03:29:07.92 --> 03:29:09.28
Hard goods durable goods.

3536
03:29:09.28 --> 03:29:10.28
durable goods.

3537
03:29:10.28 --> 03:29:11.28
All that.

3538
03:29:11.28 --> 03:29:12.28
All that.

3539
03:29:12.28 --> 03:29:14.68
And it's made of these for those you jits.

3540
03:29:14.68 --> 03:29:20.80
You can get rash cards also for those you jits or other forms of working out or surfing.

3541
03:29:20.80 --> 03:29:25.88
Although we are moving into the winter months you might need to wet suit, but that's up to

3542
03:29:25.88 --> 03:29:26.88
you.

3543
03:29:26.88 --> 03:29:27.88
We do not make wet suits.

3544
03:29:27.88 --> 03:29:30.28
Yes, yet.

3545
03:29:30.28 --> 03:29:33.52
T-shirts, jeans, boots.

3546
03:29:33.52 --> 03:29:35.12
Basically, you need clothes to wear.

3547
03:29:35.12 --> 03:29:37.12
I mean, look, here's the deal.

3548
03:29:37.12 --> 03:29:38.68
We need clothes to wear.

3549
03:29:38.68 --> 03:29:41.08
If you're going to get clothes to wear, get them from origin, main.

3550
03:29:41.08 --> 03:29:42.44
They're made in America.

3551
03:29:42.44 --> 03:29:50.12
We got a bunch of awesome people up there rebuilding a whole industry in Maine.

3552
03:29:50.12 --> 03:29:54.000
Support America and get the best possible clothing.

3553
03:29:54.000 --> 03:29:55.000
You can.

3554
03:29:55.000 --> 03:29:56.000
That's what we're talking about.

3555
03:29:56.000 --> 03:29:57.000
Yeah.

3556
03:29:57.000 --> 03:29:58.000
It's true.

3557
03:29:58.000 --> 03:29:59.36
And they have some shorts that for whatever reason.

3558
03:29:59.36 --> 03:30:00.36
I don't know why.

3559
03:30:00.36 --> 03:30:04.68
They don't talk about the shorts because it's literally a side from board shirts.

3560
03:30:04.68 --> 03:30:06.68
Like when I swim and work out or whatever.

3561
03:30:06.68 --> 03:30:08.48
These are the only shorts I wear.

3562
03:30:08.48 --> 03:30:09.48
The shark fan.

3563
03:30:09.48 --> 03:30:11.12
You like the shark fan.

3564
03:30:11.12 --> 03:30:12.12
Yeah.

3565
03:30:12.12 --> 03:30:13.08
That's a P.

3566
03:30:13.08 --> 03:30:14.08
Yeah.

3567
03:30:14.08 --> 03:30:15.08
That's naming.

3568
03:30:15.08 --> 03:30:16.08
Thanks.

3569
03:30:16.08 --> 03:30:18.08
It's very creative and gamer.

3570
03:30:18.08 --> 03:30:20.08
And I, to be honest, what do you think came to?

3571
03:30:20.08 --> 03:30:25.52
First, because the shark fan shorts has like a pocket on it that kind of looks like a shark

3572
03:30:25.52 --> 03:30:26.52
fan.

3573
03:30:26.52 --> 03:30:27.52
Yeah.

3574
03:30:27.52 --> 03:30:28.52
Yeah.

3575
03:30:28.52 --> 03:30:29.52
I don't know that.

3576
03:30:29.52 --> 03:30:33.04
So I don't know if he started to design it that way and then named it the shark

3577
03:30:33.04 --> 03:30:35.84
fan and then made it look more like a shark fan.

3578
03:30:35.84 --> 03:30:36.84
It's functional.

3579
03:30:36.84 --> 03:30:38.56
There's a reason for it, but I'm just saying.

3580
03:30:38.56 --> 03:30:38.88
P.

3581
03:30:38.88 --> 03:30:39.56
Yeah.

3582
03:30:39.56 --> 03:30:40.56
You're right.

3583
03:30:40.56 --> 03:30:41.56
You're right.

3584
03:30:41.56 --> 03:30:46.60
Well, either way, should I, to me, shark fan sounds cool straight up.

3585
03:30:46.60 --> 03:30:47.60
So I was like, hell, yeah.

3586
03:30:47.60 --> 03:30:48.60
Shark fan shirts.

3587
03:30:48.60 --> 03:30:49.60
Yeah.

3588
03:30:49.60 --> 03:30:51.44
Anyway, very good stuff.

3589
03:30:51.44 --> 03:30:52.44
Orgermake.com on Made America's.

3590
03:30:52.44 --> 03:30:53.44
Speaking of shorts.

3591
03:30:53.44 --> 03:30:54.44
Speaking of shorts.

3592
03:30:54.44 --> 03:30:55.96
We, it's, we're going to board shorts.

3593
03:30:55.96 --> 03:30:57.44
We have board shorts.

3594
03:30:57.44 --> 03:30:59.08
Defcore to the core.

3595
03:30:59.08 --> 03:31:01.56
Discipline equals freedom.

3596
03:31:01.56 --> 03:31:04.52
Board shorts at joccostore.com.

3597
03:31:04.52 --> 03:31:06.52

3598
03:31:06.52 --> 03:31:08.84
If you didn't know, it is the store.

3599
03:31:08.84 --> 03:31:12.92
It's the store where you can get stuff while you, you know, while you want them.

3600
03:31:12.92 --> 03:31:15.12
If you want to represent on the path is where you can get your shirts.

3601
03:31:15.12 --> 03:31:17.32
You just link with freedom shirts.

3602
03:31:17.32 --> 03:31:22.12
But these board shorts, like I said, but did you, did, what do you call it?

3603
03:31:22.12 --> 03:31:23.12
Did you, did you, camo?

3604
03:31:23.12 --> 03:31:24.12
Did you, camo?

3605
03:31:24.12 --> 03:31:25.12
Did you, camo?

3606
03:31:25.12 --> 03:31:26.12
Did you, camo?

3607
03:31:26.12 --> 03:31:27.12
Did you, camo?

3608
03:31:27.12 --> 03:31:28.12
I don't know.

3609
03:31:28.12 --> 03:31:29.12
I don't know how I've said it.

3610
03:31:29.12 --> 03:31:30.12
Did you do it?

3611
03:31:30.12 --> 03:31:31.12
I think I call it, did you, camo?

3612
03:31:31.12 --> 03:31:32.12
Did you, camo?

3613
03:31:32.12 --> 03:31:33.12
No, did you, camo?

3614
03:31:33.12 --> 03:31:34.12
C'mon.

3615
03:31:34.12 --> 03:31:36.72
Either way, camel flies, did you do it?

3616
03:31:36.72 --> 03:31:37.72
You know that one.

3617
03:31:37.72 --> 03:31:39.20
Anyway, go to dracostore.com.

3618
03:31:39.20 --> 03:31:41.56
Like I said, if you, whatever shirt you want, what?

3619
03:31:41.56 --> 03:31:44.80
The camel flies want or the regular straight up black one.

3620
03:31:44.80 --> 03:31:45.80
Everyone you want.

3621
03:31:45.80 --> 03:31:46.80
Available.

3622
03:31:46.80 --> 03:31:50.16
Also some girl stuff on there, some tank tops.

3623
03:31:50.16 --> 03:31:54.16
Like the hoodies hats, all this stuff.

3624
03:31:54.16 --> 03:31:56.60
If you like something, hey man, get something.

3625
03:31:56.60 --> 03:32:00.20
Yeah, and don't forget about the warrior kid.

3626
03:32:00.20 --> 03:32:01.20
Soap.

3627
03:32:01.20 --> 03:32:02.80
Just while there's warrior kids soap, actually.

3628
03:32:02.80 --> 03:32:03.80
Yes.

3629
03:32:03.80 --> 03:32:08.04
And then there is a bunch of others soap that is made by a warrior kid.

3630
03:32:08.04 --> 03:32:09.04
Yes.

3631
03:32:09.04 --> 03:32:10.04
Young, Eden.

3632
03:32:10.04 --> 03:32:11.52
We sell it in jocostore.

3633
03:32:11.52 --> 03:32:12.52
There's warrior kid soap.

3634
03:32:12.52 --> 03:32:13.52
There's jocos soap.

3635
03:32:13.52 --> 03:32:14.52
There's troopers soap.

3636
03:32:14.52 --> 03:32:17.96
All good legitimate soap.

3637
03:32:17.96 --> 03:32:24.70
But for the month of September, Irish Ops Ranch will be donating $1.

3638
03:32:24.70 --> 03:32:30.08
Per bar of soap to the cure search foundation.

3639
03:32:30.08 --> 03:32:31.08
It's called cure.

3640
03:32:31.08 --> 03:32:32.64
So it's a cancer research center.

3641
03:32:32.64 --> 03:32:33.64
It seems to be saying so.

3642
03:32:33.64 --> 03:32:37.08
Yeah, because cancer awareness month September.

3643
03:32:37.08 --> 03:32:38.68
So we're donating $1.

3644
03:32:38.68 --> 03:32:40.88
Per bar of soap sold.

3645
03:32:40.88 --> 03:32:41.88
That's young, Eden.

3646
03:32:41.88 --> 03:32:42.88
Young, that's young, Eden.

3647
03:32:42.88 --> 03:32:43.88
Young, Eden.

3648
03:32:43.88 --> 03:32:44.88
Making that happen.

3649
03:32:44.88 --> 03:32:46.28
So there's a kid.

3650
03:32:46.28 --> 03:32:48.12
I think he might be 14 now.

3651
03:32:48.12 --> 03:32:52.84
But started this company, started this company, warrior kid out there getting after

3652
03:32:52.84 --> 03:32:55.52
it and he wants to help out kids that have cancer.

3653
03:32:55.52 --> 03:32:57.76
So good for him.

3654
03:32:57.76 --> 03:33:00.20
Appreciate the support for that one.

3655
03:33:00.20 --> 03:33:01.92
Don't forget to subscribe to this podcast.

3656
03:33:01.92 --> 03:33:04.12
Don't forget that we have some other podcast.

3657
03:33:04.12 --> 03:33:08.68
The jockel unraveling podcast, which used to be called the thread.

3658
03:33:08.68 --> 03:33:12.000
We got quite a few episodes coming out of that.

3659
03:33:12.000 --> 03:33:18.04
We have the debrief podcast, which is on this thread, on the jockel podcast, what is

3660
03:33:18.04 --> 03:33:19.04
it called?

3661
03:33:19.04 --> 03:33:20.88
Feed for right now.

3662
03:33:20.88 --> 03:33:22.40
We have the ground in podcast.

3663
03:33:22.40 --> 03:33:24.20
We have the warrior kid podcast.

3664
03:33:24.20 --> 03:33:33.000
We also have a YouTube channel, which echo makes YouTube videos for jockel podcast YouTube

3665
03:33:33.000 --> 03:33:34.000
channel.

3666
03:33:34.000 --> 03:33:35.28
Also psychological warfare.

3667
03:33:35.28 --> 03:33:38.20
It's an album with tracks.

3668
03:33:38.20 --> 03:33:42.96
Jockel tracks helping you through moments of weakness as they may arise.

3669
03:33:42.96 --> 03:33:45.16
Maybe not every day, but they arise sometimes.

3670
03:33:45.16 --> 03:33:49.12
I think you might have just reached your breaking point.

3671
03:33:49.12 --> 03:33:52.72
The first thing that you've said that and you've repeated that thing that you didn't

3672
03:33:52.72 --> 03:33:53.72
have any enthusiasm.

3673
03:33:53.72 --> 03:33:54.72
Yes, when you had it, you had it.

3674
03:33:54.72 --> 03:33:56.52
You had someone who's in, but it was lower.

3675
03:33:56.52 --> 03:34:01.88
Well, you know, so all the times, because just by the way, my enthusiasm for you saying

3676
03:34:01.88 --> 03:34:04.64
that ended after about four times.

3677
03:34:04.64 --> 03:34:09.64
And now we're on, where do we go?

3678
03:34:09.64 --> 03:34:11.20
200 something to podcast?

3679
03:34:11.20 --> 03:34:14.48
So maybe you'll think of it something else to say.

3680
03:34:14.48 --> 03:34:16.48
The world hopes.

3681
03:34:16.48 --> 03:34:17.48
The world is hopeful.

3682
03:34:17.48 --> 03:34:20.48
I'm searching my brain to connect the dots.

3683
03:34:20.48 --> 03:34:24.12
They're like, I don't feel like I'm in a breaking point in any capacity.

3684
03:34:24.12 --> 03:34:26.32
But it's just broke up right here.

3685
03:34:26.32 --> 03:34:28.000
Apparently I am.

3686
03:34:28.000 --> 03:34:30.40
But so maybe I'm going to assume that you're right.

3687
03:34:30.40 --> 03:34:31.40
Yeah.

3688
03:34:31.40 --> 03:34:40.64
Maybe it's because recently I haven't needed psychological warfare help.

3689
03:34:40.64 --> 03:34:42.64
So it's not like fresh in my mind.

3690
03:34:42.64 --> 03:34:45.68
So maybe it came off like broke or anything.

3691
03:34:45.68 --> 03:34:48.44
Well, why don't you look, go and listen to the track that's about doing things that you

3692
03:34:48.44 --> 03:34:50.52
might not want to do.

3693
03:34:50.52 --> 03:34:51.52
Okay?

3694
03:34:51.52 --> 03:34:58.76
Because apparently you think you can just come in here and kind of slough off on your execution.

3695
03:34:58.76 --> 03:34:59.76
Yeah.

3696
03:34:59.76 --> 03:35:01.000
On the psychological warfare part.

3697
03:35:01.000 --> 03:35:02.000
Okay.

3698
03:35:02.000 --> 03:35:03.000
And that's kind of what you call that ironic.

3699
03:35:03.000 --> 03:35:04.000
It's ironic.

3700
03:35:04.000 --> 03:35:05.000
Very ironic.

3701
03:35:05.000 --> 03:35:06.000
All right.

3702

And everyone else out there think of the incredible odds that these Sog soldiers went up

3799
03:40:28.04 --> 03:40:34.60
against and they did it time and time and time again in those forgotten jungles on those

3800
03:40:34.60 --> 03:40:39.16
forgotten hills in that forgotten world.

3801

They sacrificed so much and we must never forget.
