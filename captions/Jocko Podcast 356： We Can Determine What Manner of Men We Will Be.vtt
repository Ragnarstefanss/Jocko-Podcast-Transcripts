00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.02
This is Jocko podcast number 356 with echo Charles and me jockel willing good evening echo good evening

2
00:00:07.64 --> 00:00:09.64
Gettysburg was a great battle

3
00:00:10.32 --> 00:00:15.60
Its action its tension its hazards its consequences

4
00:00:16.44 --> 00:00:22.84
In it were involved questions of gravest import the decision of which makes history

5
00:00:23.72 --> 00:00:27.96
interests social political moral personal of

6
00:00:27.96 --> 00:00:35.48
Gravest import for ourselves for others for our country for man everywhere

7
00:00:36.36 --> 00:00:42.44
For the present time and for the future for which also we hold a trust

8
00:00:44.28 --> 00:00:48.48
The pressing question before us was whether we had a country

9
00:00:50.04 --> 00:00:53.36
Whether we were a people or only a populace

10
00:00:53.36 --> 00:01:01.88
Whether we were a mere chance partnership only holding only by human will or a nation

11
00:01:02.60 --> 00:01:10.66
constituted in the purpose and calling of divine providence bound together for the noblest ends of living by ties of mutual

12
00:01:11.08 --> 00:01:13.08
interest and honor

13
00:01:13.36 --> 00:01:15.80
bonds both of love and law

14
00:01:15.80 --> 00:01:22.52
All the great ruling sentiments which have their vital source in this idea

15
00:01:23.20 --> 00:01:26.94
patriotism loyalty self devotion for the sake of others

16
00:01:27.48 --> 00:01:33.72
Nay what we consider the supreme of earthly blessings largest scope for individual life

17
00:01:34.48 --> 00:01:37.40
endowments powers genius character

18
00:01:38.52 --> 00:01:42.56
These were the prize for which we wrestled in that terrible arena

19
00:01:42.56 --> 00:01:44.72
more than this

20
00:01:46.08 --> 00:01:48.000
Involved here, too

21
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.48
Were the widest human interests

22
00:01:51.60 --> 00:01:56.40
We fought for the worth of manhood for law and liberty

23
00:01:56.88 --> 00:02:04.04
Which mean freedom for every man to make the most of himself with goodwill of all others

24
00:02:04.60 --> 00:02:07.12
Without oppression or depression

25
00:02:07.12 --> 00:02:14.92
We had a deep inward vision of this at the time though unspoken and perhaps unclear

26
00:02:15.56 --> 00:02:24.40
But no man even now can realize in thought or recognize in fact all the reach of good coming forth out of that struggle

27
00:02:24.40 --> 00:02:27.40
and that victory for the country and

28
00:02:28.56 --> 00:02:30.56
for mankind

29
00:02:30.56 --> 00:02:35.52
And that right there is a quote

30
00:02:36.48 --> 00:02:39.64
from a speech by Colonel Joshua Chamberlain

31
00:02:40.40 --> 00:02:44.44
And he was at a banquet to honor the 16th Maine Infantry and

32
00:02:45.32 --> 00:02:49.44
The fifth main light artillery battery knows a 16th Maine

33
00:02:50.64 --> 00:02:53.44
Who on July 1st 1863?

34
00:02:54.08 --> 00:02:58.32
They were ordered to hold a position at Chambersburg Pike

35
00:02:58.32 --> 00:03:04.36
But this element of men was eventually overrun and as they were being overrun

36
00:03:06.32 --> 00:03:10.16
They took down their flag their regimental flag and

37
00:03:11.16 --> 00:03:15.92
They ripped it to shreds so that it wouldn't be captured

38
00:03:17.04 --> 00:03:19.04
by the Confederates and

39
00:03:19.32 --> 00:03:25.88
Of their sacrifice of their 275 men 11 were killed 62 were wounded 159 were taken prisoner

40
00:03:26.56 --> 00:03:27.84
but

41
00:03:27.84 --> 00:03:31.68
Because they did that because they held the line as long as they did it allowed

42
00:03:32.16 --> 00:03:37.60
16,000 other Union troops to retreat and regroup around Gettysburg

43
00:03:39.24 --> 00:03:44.40
And of course it was the next day July 2nd when the 20th Maine

44
00:03:45.68 --> 00:03:52.60
Under the charge of Joshua Chamberlain was able to hold the Union's left flank on little round top with a bayonet charge

45
00:03:52.60 --> 00:03:57.16
That stopped the Confederates the Confederate Army's best chance for victory in that battle

46
00:03:57.16 --> 00:03:59.16
and

47
00:03:59.64 --> 00:04:03.96
Essentially at that point turned the or at least started to turn the tide of the war

48
00:04:06.24 --> 00:04:08.24
And it's no surprise

49
00:04:08.44 --> 00:04:13.52
In my humble opinion that these soldiers from Maine accounted themselves so well

50
00:04:14.68 --> 00:04:16.68
They're from a state that has

51
00:04:17.08 --> 00:04:19.08
harsh winners

52
00:04:19.20 --> 00:04:25.08
rugged terrain and a culture of hard work and self-reliance and

53
00:04:25.08 --> 00:04:29.80
And today we have someone with us that has become a manor

54
00:04:31.12 --> 00:04:37.000
After retiring from the SEAL teams and is now looking to serve his country and his state again

55
00:04:37.52 --> 00:04:44.56
His name is Ed Thielander and he's here with us tonight to share some of his experiences and lessons learned Ed

56
00:04:44.88 --> 00:04:50.60
Thanks for joining us man. Hey, thank you very much for having me on. This is awesome. It was awesome to get out here

57
00:04:50.72 --> 00:04:53.08
You know, I went out to Coronado last night

58
00:04:53.08 --> 00:04:54.56
and

59
00:04:54.56 --> 00:04:57.92
Watch some, you know some tadpoles playing on the on the old course

60
00:04:59.60 --> 00:05:01.68
And it hasn't changed much, you know

61
00:05:02.48 --> 00:05:09.28
It's that's one thing I miss from you know jumping over to the east coast was seeing these young frog, you know

62
00:05:09.60 --> 00:05:14.92
Men wannabes just get after it and and try and figure out, you know

63
00:05:14.92 --> 00:05:22.80
How to negotiate their obstacles on their own time after training and yeah, and yeah Washington run back and forth to Chow

64
00:05:22.96 --> 00:05:26.20
You know, you run six miles a day just to go eat in boots

65
00:05:27.76 --> 00:05:32.32
That's not kind of work out that's just to go eat and watching that was pretty cool

66
00:05:33.08 --> 00:05:40.16
So yeah, it's great to be back out on the west coast check it out for a little while and I'll be popping back over to these coasters

67
00:05:40.16 --> 00:05:45.16
Tonight. Yeah, the O course is all fenced off now. Yeah, I just walk out there and do it

68
00:05:45.16 --> 00:05:52.000
And I mean back in the day a civilian could basically walk out there and just run the O course and now it's all fenced off

69
00:05:52.68 --> 00:05:58.16
Which is a bummer because you know, it's kind of cool that you could just roll out there and run that thing

70
00:05:58.16 --> 00:06:00.16
Yeah, that's a pretty brutal O course

71
00:06:01.36 --> 00:06:07.28
And we'll get into that look before we get there before we talk about your buds your teams experience and all that let's start at the beginning

72
00:06:07.28 --> 00:06:13.48
Let's start where you came from where you grew up. What was going on? You're from originally from Michigan. Yeah, yeah Romeo, Michigan

73
00:06:13.60 --> 00:06:15.60
So so what was going on growing up?

74
00:06:16.04 --> 00:06:17.88
So, yeah

75
00:06:17.88 --> 00:06:19.88
Born in Marquette. My dad

76
00:06:20.08 --> 00:06:22.08
It was going to school up there

77
00:06:22.24 --> 00:06:25.76
You know, my dad did six years in the Navy and then what do you do in the Navy?

78
00:06:25.76 --> 00:06:31.72
He was a missile tech, you know subs. He wanted he was trying to talk me into go be in a nuke. Dang

79
00:06:32.40 --> 00:06:34.40
It's a hard conversation

80
00:06:34.40 --> 00:06:41.04
You keep telling me yeah, you get steak and lobster, you know, and you don't even have to get up to get a drink

81
00:06:41.04 --> 00:06:46.24
You know because you know people yeah, that's because you can't get up to get a drink

82
00:06:46.24 --> 00:06:51.32
It's so crowded. Yeah, and then you run out of fresh milk on you know with the fifth day and

83
00:06:52.40 --> 00:06:54.96
You know, they never turn the lights off or

84
00:06:55.92 --> 00:07:01.32
In the hallways, you know, it's it's or I'm sorry in in birthing in birthing

85
00:07:01.32 --> 00:07:06.48
They never turn them on except once a week to clean and then they go in there and pull up all the deck plates and get food out

86
00:07:06.48 --> 00:07:10.26
Did you ever do sub ops when you when you were in? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I was at SDV

87
00:07:10.26 --> 00:07:12.40
Oh, gosh, so I mean which is just funny

88
00:07:12.40 --> 00:07:18.96
Yeah, you know team guys with nothing to do because we're kind of all ready for whatever we're gonna go do and we've got nothing to do except make jokes

89
00:07:18.96 --> 00:07:22.72
and cause trouble, you know, we were on the Dallas and

90
00:07:24.72 --> 00:07:30.64
We're the first ones, you know getting ready to eat because we're ready to go do our little gig and there's this little S-turn

91
00:07:30.64 --> 00:07:32.48
and

92
00:07:32.48 --> 00:07:37.04
So we all line up and there's this pipe that sits right about head height right about here

93
00:07:37.56 --> 00:07:40.000
And we all lined up. So you had to hit it

94
00:07:41.44 --> 00:07:43.44
But all the sub guys

95
00:07:43.92 --> 00:07:49.88
Now they just you know shifted the head around it. It was every diver and team guy that whacked right into that thing

96
00:07:51.72 --> 00:07:58.96
Yeah, that submarine life is is a different kind of life. Yeah respect to the guys that do it. I mean, it's I

97
00:07:58.96 --> 00:08:04.44
Could I I would I think the longest I was ever on a submarine four was like maybe a

98
00:08:04.80 --> 00:08:11.40
Week and a half or something like that. We were on we went on to go do some to go get inserted somewhere and bad weather came

99
00:08:11.40 --> 00:08:17.12
And I wouldn't launch us. So we were just stuck there, right? That was my first experience with hot racking, right?

100
00:08:17.44 --> 00:08:22.08
You know, you know what that is echo? No, I'm racking. It means when you share a bed with someone

101
00:08:22.40 --> 00:08:27.36
So like you're you're working one shift when you get done

102
00:08:27.36 --> 00:08:33.48
I when you go to work I get in your bed. So we share a bed. Yeah, take turns. Yeah, take turns

103
00:08:33.48 --> 00:08:37.04
Yeah, yeah, it's yeah, you can have two to three guys. Yeah

104
00:08:37.68 --> 00:08:41.88
Not cool. So so when you get on with the SDV, you know

105
00:08:42.08 --> 00:08:48.80
The SDV is a little wet submarine for folks that don't know and they put this basically this garage on the back of a submarine

106
00:08:48.80 --> 00:08:55.16
And it is it's wildly awesome because you that whole thing is dedicated from moving, you know

107
00:08:55.16 --> 00:09:00.04
To or six guys from point A to point B this big giant garage door opens up

108
00:09:00.88 --> 00:09:05.24
The SDV goes out, you know, 10 12 20 hours later that thing comes back

109
00:09:05.96 --> 00:09:07.96
it's pretty wild but

110
00:09:08.84 --> 00:09:15.16
We bring a bunch of folks on there to help us out and get everything ready. So they clear out a rack of torpedoes and

111
00:09:16.48 --> 00:09:22.88
That becomes your bear with your beds, you know, it's just so I gave up my bed to one of my guys

112
00:09:22.88 --> 00:09:27.52
because I was getting off and he was gonna stay on and work the comms problem and

113
00:09:28.88 --> 00:09:36.16
I'm you know decent sized guy. I can't turn in under that torpedo rack because the next torpedo above you

114
00:09:36.16 --> 00:09:38.72
I actually have to squish my shoulders in tight and

115
00:09:40.32 --> 00:09:42.32
And they in the

116
00:09:43.52 --> 00:09:51.12
Torpedo area they do not turn the lights off. Yeah, that thing's just always on everywhere else. They kind of cycle daylight

117
00:09:51.12 --> 00:09:56.32
In the work other working areas except the torpedo area. So you're just in there

118
00:09:56.32 --> 00:10:02.64
You know, they do put up a curtain it means nothing your shoulder to shoulder head to head with you know, whatever it is 20 other dudes

119
00:10:04.16 --> 00:10:09.92
And your dad's trying to convince you that this is the way to go. Yeah, go be a yeah. So was he a Submariner?

120
00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:15.92
Yeah, yeah, he did six years. No, he was a torpedo man. He was trying to talk me into being a nuke

121
00:10:16.56 --> 00:10:20.04
And those nuke guys they work hard man

122
00:10:20.04 --> 00:10:23.88
It is no joke. Yeah, that job is a tough

123
00:10:24.96 --> 00:10:30.48
Grueling in the friggin nuclear engine room or what I don't know what you call it the reactor room, right?

124
00:10:31.48 --> 00:10:33.48
So to work out on a submarine

125
00:10:34.04 --> 00:10:39.80
You got to put your dosometer on because you got to walk past the nuclear reactor and then they've got it's they're all quiet

126
00:10:39.80 --> 00:10:41.80
Workouts they did have a square block of

127
00:10:42.36 --> 00:10:44.36
dumbbells, you know

128
00:10:44.60 --> 00:10:47.72
Which is you know, they all wear tennis shoes so you don't make noise

129
00:10:47.72 --> 00:10:53.80
You know so you don't get no noise can hear you from above and then it's you know, it's an elliptical not a treadmill

130
00:10:54.48 --> 00:10:56.64
So, you know, I don't want to pound in other feet

131
00:10:56.84 --> 00:11:02.28
It's yeah, you can do pull-ups on something and you got those dumbbells in it and elliptical

132
00:11:02.52 --> 00:11:08.96
Yeah, it is check an ideal life for a guy that has a more of a propensity to be a seal, right?

133
00:11:09.36 --> 00:11:13.32
Right. All right. So your dad. So what'd your dad do after he got out of the Navy?

134
00:11:13.32 --> 00:11:18.96
So, yeah, he went went to college up in northern Michigan Michigan Tech in

135
00:11:19.76 --> 00:11:25.28
So driven in three years working two jobs. He got his bachelor's and his master's

136
00:11:26.28 --> 00:11:28.28
and you know

137
00:11:28.28 --> 00:11:31.92
with with three boys and then moving down to

138
00:11:32.52 --> 00:11:35.76
Southern Michigan teacher electronics teacher. So

139
00:11:36.48 --> 00:11:42.20
It was a good in high school high school high school electronics teacher. Yeah, and it was legit. I we were

140
00:11:42.20 --> 00:11:46.92
You would do all this after-school work and weekend work with his kids

141
00:11:46.92 --> 00:11:51.72
You know his students and we'd be in there climbing in and around all the electronic gear

142
00:11:51.72 --> 00:11:59.12
And he'd have us making circuit boards it what I remember to be a ridiculously young age a good ridiculous, you know

143
00:11:59.96 --> 00:12:02.44
I mean like five years old burning circuit boards

144
00:12:03.80 --> 00:12:06.16
You know it we made stuff

145
00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:08.64
flashing lights whatever

146
00:12:08.64 --> 00:12:12.68
But it was all fun and games and then all of a sudden we can do some wild stuff, you know

147
00:12:12.80 --> 00:12:14.64
we were always forced to

148
00:12:14.64 --> 00:12:22.000
Figure things out. I took electricity in high school with the teacher. I don't we all ever called him Scotty

149
00:12:22.52 --> 00:12:25.12
But that's where I learned how to like wire houses, you know

150
00:12:25.12 --> 00:12:29.08
Yeah, and it to this day like I mean at one of my houses

151
00:12:29.08 --> 00:12:32.28
I this is when I was still in the teams like took a weekend

152
00:12:32.28 --> 00:12:39.80
And redid put an electrical sub panel redid all the wiring in my kitchen cuz all jacked up and like such a great skill to have

153
00:12:39.80 --> 00:12:45.40
Oh, yeah, and it's yeah, it's all stuck with me, you know, I figure stuff out

154
00:12:45.40 --> 00:12:53.64
We never had a new TV ever we fixed all those old tube TVs, you know and change the channel with the pliers, you know

155
00:12:53.64 --> 00:13:02.76
We fixed our cars, you know from fixing our bicycles when we were young young and then we got motorcycles, you know little

156
00:13:02.76 --> 00:13:04.76
You know wisey 60s

157
00:13:05.16 --> 00:13:10.76
And we tore those down to nothing and put them all back together again first truck, you know

158
00:13:10.76 --> 00:13:13.32
That was given to me to use

159
00:13:13.88 --> 00:13:17.64
You start that thing up at a cloud of smoke and then we tore the whole thing down

160
00:13:18.52 --> 00:13:23.000
You know in high school on the weekends because they had a lift and all that stuff

161
00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.56
So did you go to school where your dad taught? No, no

162
00:13:27.60 --> 00:13:34.88
He was like like the the big high school north or south of us, you know 2000 plus kids

163
00:13:35.04 --> 00:13:40.20
We were like the the smallest of the big schools, you know

164
00:13:40.20 --> 00:13:42.72
So so 32 mile center of town was paved

165
00:13:43.40 --> 00:13:46.84
33 mile road was dirt so we live close to the dirt road

166
00:13:46.84 --> 00:13:55.72
It's a what when when you were in school are you into school you're getting good grades getting decent grades, you know into the sports, you know

167
00:13:56.92 --> 00:14:03.48
Football wrestling and then track kind of drop track off at the end and just concentrated on football and wrestling

168
00:14:04.44 --> 00:14:12.76
You know like school, but not crazy into it, you know like the math, you know decent grades. I was a b-ish student, you know

169
00:14:14.04 --> 00:14:16.04
nothing definitely

170
00:14:16.04 --> 00:14:21.88
Not way into it. Were you thinking you were going to go to college or what was your dad steering you towards or your mom steering you towards?

171
00:14:21.96 --> 00:14:25.96
So I was getting steered towards the navy college navy college navy college, you know

172
00:14:27.32 --> 00:14:29.32
My dad really, you know

173
00:14:29.64 --> 00:14:33.80
Went up to ferris state university division two school as a college first year

174
00:14:33.88 --> 00:14:38.76
I was there became a university whatever that jump that's weird that so you would end up going to college one-year college

175
00:14:38.84 --> 00:14:43.40
Yep, and you said you got a scholarship. No. Oh, no, no

176
00:14:43.40 --> 00:14:49.16
Um, no just my dad went up there. They just me get me on the wrestling team wanted me to you know do that, you know

177
00:14:50.36 --> 00:14:56.44
Good team. So you're a good wrestler decent, you know, I enjoy a high school state wrestling did not make the states messed up my knee

178
00:14:57.16 --> 00:14:58.36
in

179
00:14:58.36 --> 00:15:00.36
Ended up having surgery on it

180
00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.40
Yeah, I just had like two-thirds of menacex taken out

181
00:15:04.44 --> 00:15:07.16
When you're like 17. Yeah. Yeah

182
00:15:07.80 --> 00:15:09.16
so so

183
00:15:09.16 --> 00:15:11.08
I had that surgery

184
00:15:11.08 --> 00:15:13.64
And in two weeks I went to wrestling camp

185
00:15:16.12 --> 00:15:19.000
So was that your senior year? Yeah, that was my senior year

186
00:15:19.40 --> 00:15:25.48
It and then you healed up enough that you could go up and you walked on to this wrestling team at ferris state university

187
00:15:25.64 --> 00:15:28.52
Yep, and I was a red shirt, you know, I did not compete

188
00:15:29.08 --> 00:15:35.000
But I stuck it all the way out. I mean I started we started out with like 90 kids and it was like 17 left it

189
00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:36.60
You know at the end, but I

190
00:15:36.60 --> 00:15:39.80
I was good weight for my coach. What weight were you? 163?

191
00:15:39.80 --> 00:15:41.80
165 whatever it was in college

192
00:15:42.68 --> 00:15:47.88
So you're just scrapping with the yeah, our coach was was you know number one in the nation

193
00:15:48.52 --> 00:15:52.84
You know who I when I came out here to to san diego his big rival

194
00:15:53.40 --> 00:15:54.52
um

195
00:15:54.52 --> 00:15:56.28
Butler was

196
00:15:56.28 --> 00:16:00.76
You know, they were number one number two. I remember my coach in college was number two butler was number one

197
00:16:01.40 --> 00:16:03.40
uh, and uh

198
00:16:03.48 --> 00:16:08.76
It was cool because I was working out out under butler at the time. I would go work out at uh

199
00:16:08.76 --> 00:16:14.28
Uh, san diego community college and russell there, you know where dean actually ended up going

200
00:16:14.52 --> 00:16:17.32
We had the same coach a couple years difference

201
00:16:18.28 --> 00:16:24.76
That's a while. Yeah. Yeah, uh, so you say you only went to you only went to college for a year. Yeah

202
00:16:25.96 --> 00:16:27.96
halfway through and I was on a

203
00:16:29.40 --> 00:16:34.36
Plastics engineering program that there wasn't room for everybody to do all all the plastic classes

204
00:16:34.36 --> 00:16:40.68
So I was on a waiting list. So I was taking my english my math. I took a 300 level metallurgy class as a freshman

205
00:16:41.24 --> 00:16:45.72
And uh, I got out of there halfway through the year. I said yep, I'm gonna go do the option

206
00:16:46.44 --> 00:16:49.72
You know finish this year out strong and then I'm gonna go be a seal

207
00:16:50.12 --> 00:16:53.32
How'd you hear about the teams did your dad tell you about them? No, uh

208
00:16:54.36 --> 00:17:00.60
Adam I guess you say adam Blake good dude, um in high school. He was reading men with green faces

209
00:17:00.60 --> 00:17:04.76
Yeah, like the only book about seal teams at the time and I go hey

210
00:17:05.32 --> 00:17:06.76
What's that about?

211
00:17:06.76 --> 00:17:10.20
He goes, oh, that's a seal teams, you know, blah blah blah. I go. Oh, that's cool

212
00:17:10.52 --> 00:17:12.60
He was trying to talk me into joining the Marine Corps with him

213
00:17:13.16 --> 00:17:15.16
Which he eventually ended up doing

214
00:17:15.64 --> 00:17:22.28
But I said hey, how come you don't want to go do that? Oh, that's crazy. You know, that's so hard. It's not really possible

215
00:17:23.32 --> 00:17:24.52
check

216
00:17:24.52 --> 00:17:30.76
And then so that put it in my head. That's what I want to do and I'll go and do the college and then you know

217
00:17:30.76 --> 00:17:33.40
Can't quit anything never allowed to quit anything as a child, you know

218
00:17:33.72 --> 00:17:36.60
So I finished the year out strong and I signed up

219
00:17:37.40 --> 00:17:40.84
For the late entry I worked out a little bit in the summer did a couple of

220
00:17:41.40 --> 00:17:45.56
Triathlons, you know because I didn't know anything about what I was really getting

221
00:17:45.72 --> 00:17:50.44
There were no books about it. There was nothing really no prep courses. No, what the recruiters say to you

222
00:17:50.44 --> 00:17:57.48
Um, come on in. Yep. Sounds great. Looks like you're gonna make a great seal. Great. See, you know, he tells everybody else

223
00:17:57.48 --> 00:17:59.64
Right, right. Uh, yeah

224
00:17:59.64 --> 00:18:05.80
So, you know, it took the asfab and all that happy stuff and you know smoke that qualified to be a new qualified to do whatever

225
00:18:06.36 --> 00:18:11.72
Um, and uh, was your dad like see son? Yeah, new. Yeah, you're still trying, you know

226
00:18:11.96 --> 00:18:14.28
What'd your dad say once you told me you're gonna try and go on the teams?

227
00:18:14.84 --> 00:18:16.60
Oh

228
00:18:16.60 --> 00:18:19.40
Yeah, cool. But at the same time, hey, you you really want to look in and you know

229
00:18:19.40 --> 00:18:21.40
Be in a nuke. Yeah

230
00:18:22.76 --> 00:18:27.80
You know being on subs is cool, you know the whole steak and lobster thing and you know, you don't have to get up to get a drink

231
00:18:27.80 --> 00:18:30.76
and you know, they're all a bunch of good dudes, but uh

232
00:18:31.48 --> 00:18:33.48
Yeah, I don't belong in a submarine

233
00:18:34.84 --> 00:18:37.80
I get on the sub to get off the sub to go do something

234
00:18:38.52 --> 00:18:44.84
And then so did they have dye fair were you died for the dye fair? That's what I was too. No, so yeah, you get a guarantee

235
00:18:45.56 --> 00:18:46.76
to

236
00:18:46.76 --> 00:18:48.60
Take a try out. Yeah

237
00:18:48.60 --> 00:18:50.60
In boot camp

238
00:18:51.08 --> 00:18:53.48
And then whether you pass that test or not

239
00:18:54.68 --> 00:18:58.36
You are in the navy for six years. Yeah, it's a great recruiting tool

240
00:18:58.36 --> 00:19:03.72
It is a great recruiting tool and that's the the seal teams is a great recruiting tool. Oh, yeah

241
00:19:03.96 --> 00:19:07.88
because it if you know, they say that the the attrition rate is like

242
00:19:08.60 --> 00:19:13.64
80 people quit or whatever something like that, right? But if you start taking all the people that

243
00:19:13.64 --> 00:19:19.16
Came in the navy to try and go to the seal teams. I mean, there's

244
00:19:19.72 --> 00:19:25.24
Most people don't even make it, you know two butts or at least a bunch of people don't make it two rights

245
00:19:25.48 --> 00:19:29.16
So they're the navy is getting a lot of a lot of people

246
00:19:29.32 --> 00:19:35.72
We're just you know blue angels. They mean that's on all the commercials. That's true, too. Yeah, who gets to do that seven of them or something like that

247
00:19:35.72 --> 00:19:42.92
You know and it's cool to be on the blue angels changing tires, but but that's not what they're advertising

248
00:19:44.44 --> 00:19:49.72
All right, so you join the navy you have no house boot camp. You're no factor. You a wrestler

249
00:19:49.88 --> 00:19:55.56
Yeah, no boot camp was just something to go through is it was pretty wild to go to Orlando or Chicago

250
00:19:55.64 --> 00:19:59.88
Yeah, oh, that's where all the die fairs when it's time. Okay. That's where I went to so I guess that makes sense

251
00:20:00.04 --> 00:20:03.40
It's wild seeing all these folks come from you know that that

252
00:20:03.40 --> 00:20:09.40
Boot camp was a factor like a wow factor either the teamwork part of it, you know

253
00:20:09.88 --> 00:20:15.40
People getting authority as a recruit that like yeah, you never have to you should never have authority

254
00:20:16.20 --> 00:20:19.88
and that and and see people stressed out about the

255
00:20:21.16 --> 00:20:23.16
simplest of things

256
00:20:23.32 --> 00:20:27.32
and that was wild to see those differences in people that that

257
00:20:27.32 --> 00:20:33.000
Uh, um, wow, you know, so yeah boot camp off the books, you know

258
00:20:33.80 --> 00:20:38.28
Boot camp navy boot camp is different. It's a lot about isolation and staying on a ship

259
00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:44.44
You're only allowed off the ship one time, you know for like the recruit weekend or something like that

260
00:20:45.08 --> 00:20:47.08
uh, you have you know

261
00:20:48.60 --> 00:20:53.08
That's what the navy's about. You're stuck on a boat and the navy's about like blue collar

262
00:20:53.08 --> 00:21:00.76
Industrial work. That's what most of the navy is sure and that's why navy boot camp is a lot about attention to detail

263
00:21:01.08 --> 00:21:03.32
Sure, you know following directions to a tee

264
00:21:04.20 --> 00:21:07.56
You know checking what you checking your work because you know if you're working on an aircraft

265
00:21:07.56 --> 00:21:11.80
You're working on a engine or you're working on a parachute like all these jobs

266
00:21:12.36 --> 00:21:18.76
They're industrial jobs. Yeah, and you got to be squared away at that thing, you know, as opposed to the army or the marine corps

267
00:21:18.76 --> 00:21:23.24
A lot of those are field jobs. You got to be doing something in the field. I mean, of course the marine corps has

268
00:21:23.32 --> 00:21:27.48
aircraft mechanics and everything else too and so does the army but that the navy is

269
00:21:28.20 --> 00:21:33.72
vast majority of it is industrial work people that know how to work on engines people that know how to work on

270
00:21:34.12 --> 00:21:37.48
Electronic equipment. That's what it is. Right. So that's what the navy boot camp is geared to

271
00:21:37.88 --> 00:21:42.36
I think it's it's come a long way now if you go watch like a navy boot camp video

272
00:21:42.92 --> 00:21:44.92
They have a simulator

273
00:21:44.92 --> 00:21:51.56
In Chicago like a ship simulator that fills with water and you gotta fight fires and so that I think they did

274
00:21:51.80 --> 00:21:54.84
Do a good job. It looks like they've done a good job at making it more

275
00:21:55.80 --> 00:22:01.08
A little bit more combat related or at least like navy war fighting to at least get you that mentality

276
00:22:01.16 --> 00:22:05.08
Because you should have that mentality if you're in the navy. So I think they've done a good job moving in that direction

277
00:22:05.08 --> 00:22:10.20
But essentially it's a bunch of industrial work that you're learning how to do. Yeah, you know

278
00:22:10.20 --> 00:22:15.08
You know thick thin thin thick. Yeah, yeah, I don't type the t-shirt the way you fold the t-shirt

279
00:22:15.64 --> 00:22:19.24
This is the echo Charles. So when you fold the t-shirt for navy boot camp standards

280
00:22:19.72 --> 00:22:23.48
There's like a certain way to fold it and it ends up looking like there's a thin layer

281
00:22:23.96 --> 00:22:27.72
Then the thick layer then there's a thin layer a thin layer and then another thick layer

282
00:22:27.72 --> 00:22:31.88
And then you got to learn this and you do it like following orders

283
00:22:32.12 --> 00:22:35.32
Tension of detail tension of detail before you get to play with the nuclear reactor

284
00:22:35.40 --> 00:22:39.24
We want to make sure you can fold the t-shirt wait. What's thick and what's thin?

285
00:22:39.24 --> 00:22:44.04
I don't know. It's the folds. Yeah, there's other material under there. So the first fold is

286
00:22:44.92 --> 00:22:49.16
Thick the next two folds are thin and then there's another thick one. It's just the way it's just a

287
00:22:49.80 --> 00:22:54.36
It's it's this funny thing that you know, I mean that was 1988

288
00:22:54.92 --> 00:22:59.80
I don't know if they still have it, but I know life babbon still folds his shirts like in a navy manner

289
00:23:00.92 --> 00:23:05.40
Yeah, I was like bro. He went to the naval academy. What the hell is that? I saw his stuff folded. I was like, yeah

290
00:23:05.40 --> 00:23:12.20
I was going over here. Yeah, it's stuck. It is a little attention to detail things. But you know, some of these folks couldn't

291
00:23:12.92 --> 00:23:14.20
There was this

292
00:23:14.20 --> 00:23:16.52
Brilliant, you know young man kid

293
00:23:17.72 --> 00:23:23.88
And he wigged out in the end started crying. Oh, yeah, you definitely see some people wig out. I mean, I just don't doubt about that

294
00:23:24.12 --> 00:23:26.04
Wow

295
00:23:26.04 --> 00:23:29.48
I mean, I understand some other things, you know what I like I wouldn't have wigged out for that

296
00:23:29.48 --> 00:23:33.88
But I get it, you know sears school and you know, and it's anybody wig out the teams

297
00:23:33.88 --> 00:23:40.76
But I saw him see it wig out in sears school. But uh, not navy boot camp. They yell at you. You know, that's an expectation

298
00:23:41.56 --> 00:23:42.60
Should be

299
00:23:42.60 --> 00:23:46.20
You know, but but some people just aren't used to that in their life, you know and

300
00:23:47.16 --> 00:23:51.88
Wow, yeah, I think also people get the impression that this is what the whole navy is going to be like for the rest of my career

301
00:23:51.88 --> 00:23:54.20
People are gonna be yelling and screaming and right and you think

302
00:23:55.08 --> 00:23:57.08
I can't take this and leave or you know

303
00:23:57.08 --> 00:24:01.48
I just want to make sure you can stand up to a little bit of stress because eventually something might get stressful

304
00:24:01.64 --> 00:24:03.000
Yeah, for sure

305
00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:07.80
Uh, so you get down. So do you go straight to buds after that? Would you go to a school? Yeah, kormin eights

306
00:24:08.60 --> 00:24:11.64
So remember maps, right? Yeah, your military and processing

307
00:24:12.68 --> 00:24:17.000
Yeah, put a fifth choice down because I put all I only I only wanted to be a seal

308
00:24:17.32 --> 00:24:23.000
You know our source ratings you had to pick a source rating because if washed out you would go to the navy and do that

309
00:24:23.64 --> 00:24:27.08
Uh, so I put down, you know three choices in an alternate

310
00:24:27.08 --> 00:24:33.08
Well, I still didn't pick kormin yet. So I said why don't you put down a fifth alternate?

311
00:24:33.16 --> 00:24:37.32
And so I got the fifth alternate core school, but it was the navy. Yeah last easy class

312
00:24:37.64 --> 00:24:39.24
It was only eight weeks

313
00:24:39.24 --> 00:24:44.44
next class shifted like 14 weeks and uh, you know trudged through that and uh

314
00:24:45.48 --> 00:24:50.52
Off to what should have been buds, but they messed my orders my orders up and sent me to balboa

315
00:24:51.24 --> 00:24:53.24
You know because they were like we're not a my

316
00:24:53.24 --> 00:25:01.48
Class 163 didn't start till whatever it was april whatever so they weren't going to get me there till like a week before

317
00:25:02.12 --> 00:25:06.84
You know, but you still had pre-training and they didn't care they needed somebody to go work

318
00:25:06.92 --> 00:25:09.72
You know somebody at the hospital was saying hey, we need some bodies

319
00:25:10.04 --> 00:25:16.12
Damn, so they sent me there and I was working for a really good senior chief and I said hey, you know, uh

320
00:25:16.60 --> 00:25:18.60
This is what I got going on. I don't think it's quite right

321
00:25:18.60 --> 00:25:24.28
And you know, I'm just a new kid in the navy and I'm still like hey, this isn't right. Um, can we check it out?

322
00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:31.000
And so I what I would do is I would go run down to rtc from balboa and I found you know

323
00:25:31.96 --> 00:25:35.96
Senior chief billy hill and and gobbled and I said hey, uh, you know senior chiefs

324
00:25:35.96 --> 00:25:39.72
Can I get a little help here because I don't think this is right? I think we yeah, that's not right

325
00:25:39.80 --> 00:25:41.80
Go get your swim in we'll fix it

326
00:25:41.80 --> 00:25:44.28
And so they fixed my orders, but it took a couple weeks

327
00:25:44.28 --> 00:25:49.88
So then I I got to buds and a week and a half later I classed up and started damn

328
00:25:50.92 --> 00:25:53.08
And you know class 163. Yeah

329
00:25:53.72 --> 00:25:58.92
And you classed up a week and a half after you got there. Yeah, you said that's uh, that's a little bit of a

330
00:26:00.20 --> 00:26:01.48
Quick start

331
00:26:01.48 --> 00:26:07.24
Yeah, because I didn't know anything, you know, I'm seeing everybody there. They like got their you know that rope around their belt

332
00:26:07.72 --> 00:26:11.000
You know and say hey, what's that about? Oh, yeah, we're doing underwater knot tying tomorrow

333
00:26:11.96 --> 00:26:13.72
Jack. Yeah

334
00:26:13.72 --> 00:26:15.16
Were you a good swimmer?

335
00:26:15.16 --> 00:26:18.68
I was a decent swimmer, you know, um, you know, I sink like a rock

336
00:26:18.84 --> 00:26:21.40
I basically, you know beat the water into submission

337
00:26:21.88 --> 00:26:27.64
Everybody's ever been a tried to be a real swimmer. You cannot beat the water into submission and go faster, you know

338
00:26:28.60 --> 00:26:34.36
It yeah, they sound like you sound like my kind of swimmer. Yeah, it's me against me fighting the water

339
00:26:34.44 --> 00:26:37.16
Yeah, uh, somewhat vertical through the water plane. Yeah

340
00:26:38.60 --> 00:26:41.72
I sink like a stone, but you are comfortable like not time when it did come

341
00:26:41.72 --> 00:26:45.72
Yeah, I do as a kid, you know, but you know not tying

342
00:26:46.52 --> 00:26:52.36
Okay, how do you tie that? You know those series of knots, you know, I didn't know and you know, that's what we're doing tomorrow

343
00:26:52.84 --> 00:26:54.84
Okay, how do you tie those knots?

344
00:26:55.40 --> 00:26:57.40
How was hell week for you and your class?

345
00:26:58.44 --> 00:27:02.44
Uh, yeah, uh, you know summer hell weeks, you know, just

346
00:27:03.56 --> 00:27:06.04
They're warmer, um, you know, uh

347
00:27:06.04 --> 00:27:13.48
Uh, these these other guys that are thinner are they are gonna suffer before I was because I was I'm you know, the mesomorph

348
00:27:13.64 --> 00:27:17.88
You know, I'm naturally heavier guy. Um, so basically they

349
00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:23.40
Kept that boat on your head longer and you know, my neck will tell you about that today still

350
00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:26.52
Yeah, uh

351
00:27:26.52 --> 00:27:28.28
Yeah, you know, um

352
00:27:28.28 --> 00:27:33.96
Remember remembering all the wild things about about hell week, you know, you know, what was your worst, you know, thinking hell week

353
00:27:33.96 --> 00:27:35.96
Tuesday

354
00:27:39.96 --> 00:27:41.96
So, uh

355
00:27:44.28 --> 00:27:46.28
Ryan Zinke what was uh

356
00:27:47.16 --> 00:27:49.16
Our first phase officer

357
00:27:49.48 --> 00:27:53.64
And at at uh chow times eat four times a day at chow time

358
00:27:54.44 --> 00:27:56.44
He would go around and make sure no one fell asleep

359
00:27:57.16 --> 00:27:58.92
And if you nod it off

360
00:27:58.92 --> 00:28:00.92
You're gonna get a jalapeno

361
00:28:00.92 --> 00:28:06.60
You know, so ed being from michigan and you know roast beef and mashed potatoes, you know

362
00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:13.32
Peppers like the ultimate spice and you sparingly my mom's, you know, french canada. There's it's a lot more bland food

363
00:28:13.48 --> 00:28:18.20
I've never had a jalapeno in my life and your lips are blistered, you know

364
00:28:19.16 --> 00:28:21.16
So it eats the jalapeno check

365
00:28:23.40 --> 00:28:25.40
And I threw up

366
00:28:25.72 --> 00:28:28.12
You know, it's a one mile run with a boat on your head

367
00:28:28.12 --> 00:28:32.04
I threw up for a mile and a little bit because we ran all the way to the oak horse

368
00:28:32.44 --> 00:28:34.44
And we did the oak horse with our boat

369
00:28:34.92 --> 00:28:40.44
And I threw up all the way through that oak horse hauling the boat around and then I've got no

370
00:28:41.08 --> 00:28:43.08
Fuel in the tank

371
00:28:43.16 --> 00:28:45.56
That was a long long day

372
00:28:46.44 --> 00:28:51.32
Yeah, I remember that, you know, and then remember the other things about, you know, the hallucin is a you know hallucinating

373
00:28:51.80 --> 00:28:55.08
You know, you know, lion's lope, you know, the uh

374
00:28:55.08 --> 00:29:01.64
You know getting mad at my paddle. I remember though my paddle is not, you know, you know making us go

375
00:29:01.80 --> 00:29:07.000
I'm crying hard, you know, that this paddle should make me go faster, you know, uh

376
00:29:07.96 --> 00:29:10.68
Yeah, remembering paddle prayers, you know

377
00:29:12.28 --> 00:29:14.12
What's paddle prayers?

378
00:29:14.12 --> 00:29:20.04
So they would put us together around in a circle. Oh, it's we have paddle above the other guy's head

379
00:29:20.12 --> 00:29:21.16
You got your paddle

380
00:29:21.16 --> 00:29:27.24
So you got your paddle so you're like this and when you fall asleep you try and catch yourself and you whack the tune

381
00:29:29.72 --> 00:29:31.72
Is that in the program?

382
00:29:33.56 --> 00:29:39.24
Yeah, uh, you know, I was a really motivated young, you know, uh number one bow line man

383
00:29:39.40 --> 00:29:43.88
You know the guy the guy that jumps out on the rock portage and and here's the boat

384
00:29:44.28 --> 00:29:49.24
I wanted to be that guy, you know, uh, that's the spot man. That's the spot get in there

385
00:29:49.24 --> 00:29:55.48
Let's do this and when that boat's upside down on your head, uh, that's spot too because you're taking some serious weight

386
00:29:55.96 --> 00:30:00.68
Yeah, that's a dangerous evolution in big waves man. Good old rock portage, you know, we didn't have helmets

387
00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:07.96
Yeah, you know, we had k-pox, you know, a big giant, you know horribly uncomfortable life jackets, uh, and uh

388
00:30:09.64 --> 00:30:14.36
Wow now they got helmets, you know, I dude I I noticed they took the stump jump completely out now

389
00:30:14.84 --> 00:30:17.80
Yeah, but they reduced the stumps first

390
00:30:17.80 --> 00:30:22.84
And now the stumps are all gone and they're tight as you know, and that's kind because that's a mental thing

391
00:30:23.56 --> 00:30:26.76
you know, um, everybody knew the right stump to jump on

392
00:30:27.40 --> 00:30:29.16
it's just that

393
00:30:29.16 --> 00:30:34.68
All the fear of falling. Yeah, and I don't remember anybody falling. I you know, I don't know that somebody fell and they hit their head

394
00:30:34.68 --> 00:30:38.36
I don't know what the echo this is on on the obstacle course

395
00:30:39.32 --> 00:30:44.28
One of the first was I guess was this actually the second obstacle you go across that dip bar thing, right, right?

396
00:30:44.44 --> 00:30:46.44
and then you hop off and there'd be

397
00:30:46.44 --> 00:30:50.76
Telephone poles caught off at various heights in the ground like stumps

398
00:30:51.40 --> 00:30:56.36
And you would have to jump from stump to stump to stump and they'd kind of increase in heights and the last one

399
00:30:56.60 --> 00:31:02.76
Was a little was depending on which route if you took the right route, which everybody knew right last one was the tallest one

400
00:31:03.56 --> 00:31:07.48
Had to jump a little bit further for it. And then you could jump you jump up onto this

401
00:31:08.44 --> 00:31:13.96
Grab this wall this low wall, which was probably like 10 10 feet. Yeah something like that from the stump from the stump

402
00:31:13.96 --> 00:31:15.96
Oh, yeah, but it did take

403
00:31:16.60 --> 00:31:24.44
It did take like a what's commitment right commitment to jump from stump to stump and a guy you used to

404
00:31:25.08 --> 00:31:29.32
Committing right and now it's just tires like you see on a football field, you know, you run the tires

405
00:31:29.40 --> 00:31:33.56
Oh, yeah, you're right about that psychological part right right there. There's a fear of falling

406
00:31:33.56 --> 00:31:39.000
It's just like, you know, if you focus on the the stump that you might fall on you're not looking at the stump that you want

407
00:31:39.48 --> 00:31:42.28
You know like if you're are you skiers?

408
00:31:42.28 --> 00:31:45.000
Yeah, you know if you ski with a helmet on

409
00:31:45.56 --> 00:31:47.56
And then you take your helmet off

410
00:31:47.80 --> 00:31:53.24
There you see you ski slower, especially if you ski in the trees. I mean you're skiing in the trees and

411
00:31:54.84 --> 00:31:56.36
If you're looking

412
00:31:56.36 --> 00:32:01.56
For the gaps you're good to go if you're looking for the trees that you don't want to hit you're gonna find that tree

413
00:32:02.28 --> 00:32:05.48
You know and it's the same kind of thing. It's it's it's it's a psychological thing

414
00:32:05.96 --> 00:32:08.60
You know to get you moving forward. Yep

415
00:32:08.60 --> 00:32:15.24
And they got helmets now too that they wear all the time which is weird too because like even during hell week they wear helmets

416
00:32:15.96 --> 00:32:16.92
Really?

417
00:32:16.92 --> 00:32:24.52
Which is to me the agony of that boat grinding on your head was like a huge part of of what's oh, yeah

418
00:32:25.64 --> 00:32:27.64
Yeah, guys

419
00:32:27.72 --> 00:32:32.92
You're getting you know your head getting some serious sunburn. You don't have a whole bunch of hair. Yeah

420
00:32:33.88 --> 00:32:36.60
It's yeah, your head's getting blistered

421
00:32:36.60 --> 00:32:39.32
It's a psychological part of it man that that

422
00:32:40.76 --> 00:32:43.16
Yeah, I don't know if I'd want to wear a helmet or not actually

423
00:32:43.48 --> 00:32:47.32
I keep you a little warm, you know, I don't know any other so once you got done with hell week

424
00:32:47.32 --> 00:32:50.28
You're in the rest of the buds. Was there any other major challenges for you there?

425
00:32:51.08 --> 00:32:53.24
Um eating dry out at the island

426
00:32:53.80 --> 00:32:56.44
Would you say eating dry? Yeah, so, you know

427
00:32:57.16 --> 00:33:02.36
At least one meal a day you had to either do the pull-ups the frog hill run or the rope climb

428
00:33:03.24 --> 00:33:05.24
What did you suck at something pull-ups?

429
00:33:05.24 --> 00:33:10.28
Okay, I could not yeah gravity, you know rope climb is fine because you use your legs technique

430
00:33:11.40 --> 00:33:14.52
But man, I ate wet a lot pull-up day

431
00:33:16.04 --> 00:33:23.000
It was funny because because for whatever reason I never did pull-ups growing up and uh, yeah, that was uh

432
00:33:23.64 --> 00:33:30.20
The island was second phase for me. Yeah, uh, then it switched eventually. Yeah, we're back to it. I guess so

433
00:33:30.20 --> 00:33:36.76
Yeah, eventually. I mean I became a pull-up freak, you know as a big guy, you know, I think uh

434
00:33:37.24 --> 00:33:43.48
Even after my shoulder surgeries. I did, you know, 26 pull-ups like six months later. It's like it's personal challenge

435
00:33:44.92 --> 00:33:46.36
But uh, yeah

436
00:33:46.36 --> 00:33:53.16
So so pull-ups was one, you know running not a great runner, you know swimming, but you know you're swimming, you know, uh

437
00:33:54.36 --> 00:33:56.36
Yeah

438
00:33:56.36 --> 00:34:02.84
Not a top performer by any means, uh, but just kept going forward, you know, and uh, you know, just

439
00:34:03.64 --> 00:34:10.28
All you had to do is perform, you know, um pass, you know, but perform, you know not tying

440
00:34:11.16 --> 00:34:13.16
um

441
00:34:13.48 --> 00:34:15.48
Normally no factor

442
00:34:15.48 --> 00:34:17.48
We did it in the dive tower

443
00:34:18.12 --> 00:34:19.56
How deep?

444
00:34:19.56 --> 00:34:22.04
Well the ropes stay the same depth

445
00:34:22.04 --> 00:34:26.44
The uh 10 feet Zinke took me down to 50 feet

446
00:34:28.20 --> 00:34:30.44
And we just hung out there and looked at each other

447
00:34:31.32 --> 00:34:33.96
And uh till he was you know tired

448
00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:38.28
And then we came up to the top and there is a set

449
00:34:39.64 --> 00:34:43.72
You know, it's all set what you're supposed to be doing. Uh, and uh

450
00:34:44.76 --> 00:34:45.96
I was like

451
00:34:45.96 --> 00:34:48.60
Okay, yeah, you're ready to go. Yeah ready to go. Yeah, you know

452
00:34:48.60 --> 00:34:55.96
And we went down and uh, and then we we came back up, you know, and bam next knot

453
00:34:57.24 --> 00:35:00.52
They were back down again and back up and down. So I failed that

454
00:35:02.20 --> 00:35:07.24
Yeah, uh, you know, that's one thing that's interesting what I remember about some of the breath holding stuff

455
00:35:07.80 --> 00:35:11.80
Like 50 meter underwater swim you go on a budge. You're like, ah, it's no big deal. I could do that

456
00:35:12.60 --> 00:35:13.48
but

457
00:35:13.48 --> 00:35:19.56
And not tying I'll take what's in nine feet go down there tie knot but you're in in buds because of everything that's going on

458
00:35:19.80 --> 00:35:23.88
You're constantly like beat down. So you almost always have a cough

459
00:35:23.96 --> 00:35:29.64
You kind of have a cold you kind of have like you guess you're always like that you're always tired like like a four mile time run

460
00:35:30.36 --> 00:35:32.12
four mile time run

461
00:35:32.12 --> 00:35:38.12
First phase was 32 minutes four mile time run. You look at that on paper on the outside. You're like, whoa, what's that?

462
00:35:38.12 --> 00:35:40.68
That's a freaking. Well, you know, I like to do that. No problem

463
00:35:40.68 --> 00:35:44.84
Then you get in there. You got boots on you got pants on you're running in the soft sand

464
00:35:45.40 --> 00:35:51.08
And the run is not four miles. It's like 4.2 miles for point four miles 4.5 miles

465
00:35:51.32 --> 00:35:52.28
right

466
00:35:52.28 --> 00:35:59.08
And then and and what'd you do the night before the night before that morning four o'clock in the morning four mile time run

467
00:35:59.24 --> 00:36:05.40
You did, you know, a thousand eight count bodybuilders or you did buddy carries up and down the burn. So everything is

468
00:36:05.40 --> 00:36:12.92
Harder than it then you think it's going to be in buds. It's not what's on paper. It's what what actually happens is harder

469
00:36:13.32 --> 00:36:14.36
Yeah, no

470
00:36:14.36 --> 00:36:20.68
And you didn't get to eat but you had to run to chow and you had to go through the line and touch the hamburger that you want to eat

471
00:36:21.08 --> 00:36:25.000
Um, but there was no time to actually eat it, you know, you wasted time running all of it

472
00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:27.96
But you that's what you must go there to do that

473
00:36:28.20 --> 00:36:33.80
But there's no time to actually sit down and eat and then you run and you go do the evolution because you have to be at the evolution on time

474
00:36:33.80 --> 00:36:43.40
Did you get rolled for anything? No, no first time every time. Yeah, it's uh, um, well, I mean I fail that but but my lungs were messed up from

475
00:36:43.64 --> 00:36:48.20
From hell week not times right after hell week. That's that's that's the kind of thing that makes it hard

476
00:36:48.20 --> 00:36:50.68
He's like you get done with hell week. You're jacked up man

477
00:36:50.68 --> 00:36:56.68
Right and now you got to go do these knots underwater and you're like you can barely even hold your breath for 10 seconds

478
00:36:56.92 --> 00:36:58.12
or socks

479
00:36:58.12 --> 00:37:05.16
And then you get taken down to the bottom. Yeah, you know 50 feet going down to 50 feet is no joke. I mean that's a that's a legit

480
00:37:05.40 --> 00:37:07.40
That's a legit swim, right?

481
00:37:07.56 --> 00:37:13.000
Subsurface swim that takes a that takes a decent amount of time just to get down to 50 feet

482
00:37:13.32 --> 00:37:15.32
Right and now you got to do your little

483
00:37:15.56 --> 00:37:19.72
Happy time with us right now in the tower. Yeah, the tower was 50. We went to the bottom sat

484
00:37:20.44 --> 00:37:22.44
Do you see it's gone now the tower? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

485
00:37:23.24 --> 00:37:24.68
Yeah, yeah

486
00:37:24.68 --> 00:37:28.44
I drove around there just checking everything out and so what are you are you like a seaman?

487
00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:34.36
Apprentice at this point or just a e3. Yeah. Yeah, it was there happy to be there check. Yeah, I mean

488
00:37:35.80 --> 00:37:40.12
Knowledge of the navy knowledge of what I'm you know other than I'm signing up

489
00:37:40.20 --> 00:37:46.92
I'm you know, I'm gonna get to shoot blow things up skydive scuba dive serve my country. Hell. Yeah, you know, uh,

490
00:37:47.08 --> 00:37:49.08
Let's rock and roll. That's right. Hey, cool

491
00:37:49.80 --> 00:37:52.36
it uh, you know, they'd like um

492
00:37:52.36 --> 00:37:54.36
Um

493
00:37:54.44 --> 00:37:58.76
Pull comp, you know, that was another one where you know, and I had uh, um

494
00:38:00.04 --> 00:38:02.04
One of the mean instructors

495
00:38:02.04 --> 00:38:05.64
Uh, uh, uh, and was he a senior chief at the time? Yes, he was

496
00:38:06.04 --> 00:38:08.04
I know exactly what you're talking about

497
00:38:08.68 --> 00:38:10.68
Yeah, and uh

498
00:38:11.88 --> 00:38:13.88
Hey great respect, you know, um

499
00:38:14.76 --> 00:38:20.76
But he ripped my mask off at the beginning, you know, so basically you got your your you got these old scuba tanks on with

500
00:38:20.76 --> 00:38:27.000
Uh flexible hoses that you can tie knots into not modern gear. They're actually soft hollow

501
00:38:27.80 --> 00:38:30.28
Hoses so you can tie knots into them to cut the air off

502
00:38:30.92 --> 00:38:32.68
uh, and uh

503
00:38:32.68 --> 00:38:35.96
You know, he takes my mask off and leave but leaves it on my head

504
00:38:36.60 --> 00:38:41.32
And I said, okay, I'm not gonna put it back on. I'm just gonna keep he's just swim back and forth

505
00:38:41.64 --> 00:38:47.24
And you get to the end you turn around and while they're doing that they're just coming in on you and wrecking your gear

506
00:38:47.24 --> 00:38:50.20
And you have to do everything procedurally correct

507
00:38:50.84 --> 00:38:55.32
And uh, I did everything procedurally correct, but since my mask was accessible

508
00:38:55.88 --> 00:38:57.88
I should have put it on

509
00:38:57.96 --> 00:38:59.96
fail

510
00:39:00.92 --> 00:39:02.92
There you go

511
00:39:03.48 --> 00:39:10.44
So I had to do that again, uh, uh, and I got even harder instructor. Uh, we considered harder but fair in my mind, you know, uh

512
00:39:11.16 --> 00:39:13.16
Superdude, but he uh

513
00:39:13.48 --> 00:39:14.68
um

514
00:39:14.68 --> 00:39:19.40
Yeah, I got put through the ringer again, but but you know, I put my mask on one day was available

515
00:39:20.28 --> 00:39:25.000
And uh lesson learned lesson learned. Yeah, I was a whole bunch of learning because I didn't do any of the

516
00:39:25.48 --> 00:39:30.68
You know, well, they didn't teach you that prehens because that was third phase for me, you know, I've been there, you know

517
00:39:31.40 --> 00:39:33.40
You know back into shape again

518
00:39:33.96 --> 00:39:39.16
It takes like a year is what they say to recover from hell week. You look at some of those cats

519
00:39:39.72 --> 00:39:41.72
um, and I remember, you know, I was

520
00:39:41.72 --> 00:39:48.12
A class corpsman, you know sending dudes to the hospital with encephalitis, you know, their hands are just, you know

521
00:39:48.28 --> 00:39:54.60
Big giant puff balls and their feet, you know, uh, it's uh, and we didn't get any sleep in hell week

522
00:39:54.68 --> 00:39:57.72
You're supposed they're scheduled to sleep, you know, uh

523
00:39:58.36 --> 00:39:59.96
But we did not get that

524
00:39:59.96 --> 00:40:04.20
Yeah, I think the scheduled sleep might be a couple hours total something like that

525
00:40:04.20 --> 00:40:07.32
Yeah, there's two blocks of it and you're supposed to get dry first

526
00:40:08.04 --> 00:40:09.64
um

527
00:40:09.64 --> 00:40:11.64
That one I know my class got because

528
00:40:12.68 --> 00:40:15.16
They you know, they tell you some story like hey the

529
00:40:15.72 --> 00:40:21.40
The the the skipper said we're being too hard on you guys where we have to stand down for eight hours

530
00:40:21.48 --> 00:40:25.64
You guys go get dry and you guys can go to bed and we'll wake you up tomorrow

531
00:40:26.36 --> 00:40:27.88
And I mean, you know, it's bullshit

532
00:40:27.88 --> 00:40:32.28
But you still you put on dry clothes and then you go and you actually get in your bed

533
00:40:33.08 --> 00:40:36.84
And this is probably probably tuesday. Yeah, and and then you know

534
00:40:36.84 --> 00:40:41.16
A half an hour later they come in and they get you up and hit the surf and right

535
00:40:41.24 --> 00:40:44.84
But but guys quit because it's it's a smart move to get people to quit

536
00:40:44.84 --> 00:40:47.24
Oh, yeah, because they go into the comfort zone, right?

537
00:40:47.32 --> 00:40:50.76
And then they bring you back out, you know, you gotta watch out for that comfort zone, bro

538
00:40:50.76 --> 00:40:55.56
That they go grab a hold of you. Oh, yeah, that's like when you're doing a long rock march. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

539
00:40:55.64 --> 00:40:57.64
If you stop you got to stop for like

540
00:40:57.96 --> 00:41:02.60
Five minutes eight minutes 10 minutes at the most then you got to get your ass up and start walking again because

541
00:41:02.60 --> 00:41:10.28
You start going into that 15 minute break 20 minute break your body gets cold and you're screwed getting back up

542
00:41:10.92 --> 00:41:16.76
But uh, yeah, so I we slept that point and you know, you fall sometimes you're just falling asleep

543
00:41:16.84 --> 00:41:23.08
I mean, there's nothing you can do about it. You're gonna fall asleep. Yeah, the uh, so they got us into dry clothes

544
00:41:23.96 --> 00:41:29.40
And we had a kid in our class that um quit on tuesday, you know

545
00:41:29.40 --> 00:41:36.20
Whatever 20 class or whatever, you know years before came back and uh, so he had knowledge up to tuesday

546
00:41:40.36 --> 00:41:43.24
And so we kind of you know, he knew something about that

547
00:41:43.96 --> 00:41:45.96
So we got dry, but then they put us on the grinder

548
00:41:46.60 --> 00:41:52.68
and uh on the pavement where we worked out and you know, we started doing flutter kicks and uh

549
00:41:53.96 --> 00:41:57.40
Instructors up there doing our flutter kicks. He brought the class leader up there

550
00:41:57.40 --> 00:42:02.44
And uh headed the class leader started leading us and then the instructors walked away

551
00:42:03.96 --> 00:42:08.04
And we're on our backs. We're in dry clothes. That's the standard

552
00:42:08.76 --> 00:42:09.64
um

553
00:42:09.64 --> 00:42:11.64
class leader would not let us go to sleep

554
00:42:12.68 --> 00:42:14.28
it's like

555
00:42:14.28 --> 00:42:18.12
Yeah, I go, you know, he's trying to go around making us say our social security numbers or birthdays

556
00:42:18.20 --> 00:42:20.60
You know trying to keep everybody awake and it's like

557
00:42:21.24 --> 00:42:23.24
I go and I'm

558
00:42:23.48 --> 00:42:24.76
I am a kid

559
00:42:24.76 --> 00:42:27.48
You know, I go you're doing the job for them

560
00:42:31.32 --> 00:42:33.32
And uh

561
00:42:33.48 --> 00:42:39.72
So then they at the end because they they're you know in that first phase corner office

562
00:42:40.52 --> 00:42:47.88
Just giggling I I imagine you know, uh, and then they uh, let us you know said I they're probably trying to figure out how to make that officer quit

563
00:42:48.76 --> 00:42:50.76
Yeah

564
00:42:50.76 --> 00:42:53.000
They weren't gonna make that guy quit that guy's a haas

565
00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:58.52
He's doing the underwater swim you gotta swim you gotta swim tight up

566
00:42:59.08 --> 00:43:05.56
Um, and you gotta do a flip into the water and then you swim 25 meters flip and then turn around and come back

567
00:43:06.84 --> 00:43:08.84
Without a mask on

568
00:43:09.08 --> 00:43:11.08
So he did it flutter kicking

569
00:43:11.64 --> 00:43:12.52
Damn

570
00:43:12.52 --> 00:43:17.48
Yeah, no, no, no, this is not not the tight up one the one you just the water swing the 100 meter

571
00:43:17.48 --> 00:43:22.44
Um tight up one, you know, uh, but but you have a mask on I think on that one

572
00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:28.76
Uh, but the other one you didn't have a mask. He's flutter kicking it and he swam off course

573
00:43:29.64 --> 00:43:32.12
Finally got back on course made it there and back

574
00:43:32.60 --> 00:43:39.000
It hard hard hard to stone. Yeah, uh college football player, you know, uh, but

575
00:43:39.72 --> 00:43:42.76
Yeah, so they put us put us to bed and um

576
00:43:42.76 --> 00:43:48.52
Um, somebody had a watch hidden you're not allowed to have a watch you have no concept of time or day or anything

577
00:43:48.84 --> 00:43:54.52
Uh, and uh, you're always trying to figure out what day it is a little bit, you know, uh, you know

578
00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:57.72
Trying to remember what meal you count for meal to meal basically

579
00:43:58.28 --> 00:43:59.40
um

580
00:43:59.40 --> 00:44:03.000
And uh, yeah, so 22 minutes. That's what we got for hell week

581
00:44:03.64 --> 00:44:05.64
Of sleep. It's not a lot of sleep

582
00:44:05.64 --> 00:44:14.60
Oh legit, so you graduate from buds and what did you want to go where did you end up going team three?

they were they were, you know, uh

630
00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:31.88
Tune in some folks up. I was on watch, you know, it was untouchable

631
00:47:33.16 --> 00:47:35.32
Dave the ghost man Casper

632
00:47:35.88 --> 00:47:39.08
Um, they were going after him and they chased him

633
00:47:39.08 --> 00:47:43.32
He got up on top of the mill bands and the rsu's that were over by the fence

634
00:47:44.04 --> 00:47:48.84
And that's there's a gap big enough to drive a semi tractor trailer and unload it

635
00:47:49.64 --> 00:47:55.64
He jumped over that barb wire and made it out into the desert and spent the night up freedom freedom

636
00:47:59.72 --> 00:48:06.04
Right on and then so what'd you do on deployment back then, uh, you know, I I deployed training, you know, uh fed, uh,

637
00:48:06.12 --> 00:48:08.12
You know, did you go to any cool countries?

638
00:48:08.12 --> 00:48:15.72
Yeah, uh, I had a blast in, you know, South Korea, um, you know, we went to Japan did some sub ops there. We did, uh

639
00:48:17.08 --> 00:48:19.08
Shoot where else did we go?

640
00:48:19.32 --> 00:48:21.32
I mean, there wasn't a whole bunch of traveling, you know

641
00:48:22.28 --> 00:48:24.52
Golf kicked off we deployed early

642
00:48:25.08 --> 00:48:28.36
You know, I did not we didn't do did you backfill someone that went to the golf or something

643
00:48:28.60 --> 00:48:33.96
Yeah, yeah, uh seal team five worst job ever in the teams. Hey, we just need you to backfill for the guys that are going to war

644
00:48:34.04 --> 00:48:35.56
You're like, no

645
00:48:35.56 --> 00:48:37.56
So yeah, I missed out, uh, you know

646
00:48:37.56 --> 00:48:42.20
Well significant parts of the work up, you know as a new guy too, you know and as a corpsman

647
00:48:44.68 --> 00:48:46.84
Back then we didn't have the training that they got now

648
00:48:47.40 --> 00:48:51.96
You know, and I could have got some more of that, you know, uh, but I mean the first stitches I ever

649
00:48:52.84 --> 00:48:54.84
ever did other than on a

650
00:48:55.40 --> 00:48:56.84
You know, uh

651
00:48:56.84 --> 00:48:58.84
fruit

652
00:48:59.24 --> 00:49:01.24
Was my own knee

653
00:49:01.24 --> 00:49:03.24
Workup out of niland and they had, uh

654
00:49:03.24 --> 00:49:08.28
Uh a pistol course we were running there was a pipe you had to crawl through that had bullet holes in it

655
00:49:08.84 --> 00:49:11.96
and uh, you know, you know dug on my knee and you know, I

656
00:49:12.84 --> 00:49:14.44
I never even

657
00:49:14.44 --> 00:49:16.44
used lidocaine because

658
00:49:16.68 --> 00:49:18.92
I wasn't I taught that in core school

659
00:49:19.56 --> 00:49:21.56
You know, and I hadn't been through

660
00:49:21.56 --> 00:49:24.36
Um the empty course where you got all that

661
00:49:24.92 --> 00:49:27.24
Yeah at this point in the work up and so

662
00:49:28.12 --> 00:49:31.40
A whole platoon watching me because I'm the doc in the platoon

663
00:49:31.40 --> 00:49:38.52
Um and uh, which again was just crazy wrong, you know from what they get a platoon guy now had more training

664
00:49:38.76 --> 00:49:43.000
The regular platoon guy now has more than than what I had there so squirt away and uh, you know

665
00:49:43.24 --> 00:49:46.92
I never tied a knot on a human, you know a stitch and so

666
00:49:47.56 --> 00:49:49.56
everybody's watching

667
00:49:49.72 --> 00:49:52.04
And uh, you know figured it out

668
00:49:52.84 --> 00:50:00.12
Yeah, herk herk herk doc. Uh, yeah doc herk was you know supervising me and uh,

669
00:50:00.12 --> 00:50:02.12
I figured it out, you know

670
00:50:03.72 --> 00:50:05.72
Cleaned it cleaned it out myself

671
00:50:06.52 --> 00:50:08.52
and that was you know, but

672
00:50:09.32 --> 00:50:12.68
They were you know, we came back second platoon. We were like getting ready to get uh,

673
00:50:13.24 --> 00:50:18.60
Corazon Aquinas out, you know 92 time frame 91 92 and that was

674
00:50:20.20 --> 00:50:22.20
That was a fun little, uh, you know

675
00:50:22.84 --> 00:50:28.92
Jump into the deployment. We jumped into doing that and you you've done the quick ducks where you're uh, um

676
00:50:28.92 --> 00:50:36.12
In recoveries where you're driving right into the back of a 47. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, we were doing in the back of 53s

677
00:50:36.68 --> 00:50:40.04
That's why I wrote her. Yeah. How's that work? That's gotta be sketchy

678
00:50:40.60 --> 00:50:43.16
Especially when you're by yourself, but I you know

679
00:50:43.80 --> 00:50:47.40
Um, what are they like? Hey, you got this you drive it in there. We'll we'll wait

680
00:50:48.36 --> 00:50:54.84
Yeah, so so we you know, everybody goes out and uh, no big deal, you know, but they're um, it's uh

681
00:50:54.84 --> 00:50:58.20
It's fully inflated just about or it was a

682
00:50:59.16 --> 00:51:04.04
Drive take everybody on shore and then recover back onto the same helo by yourself

683
00:51:04.68 --> 00:51:06.68
It's 240 not rotor wash

684
00:51:07.32 --> 00:51:08.60
from uh

685
00:51:08.60 --> 00:51:11.24
A 53. Yeah, so echo just to explain what he's talking about

686
00:51:12.44 --> 00:51:15.96
So a ch 53 is a big giant helicopter

687
00:51:16.44 --> 00:51:22.60
But you ever seen the helicopters that have two big rotors on top, right? That's what we would normally do this on

688
00:51:22.60 --> 00:51:28.12
Well, that's called a 47 or a 46 is a little small but a 47 is big

689
00:51:28.92 --> 00:51:33.56
But the 53 has a tail rotor like a normal helicopter. So when you drive in the back

690
00:51:34.12 --> 00:51:40.60
You're coming close to this thing for sure. Oh, yeah. No, you come in you're coming in at a 45

691
00:51:41.32 --> 00:51:44.20
Um, and you've got to make sure your your engine's on tilt

692
00:51:44.52 --> 00:51:48.20
You're coming in at a 45 to void the tail rotor. Um, because that's legit

693
00:51:48.20 --> 00:51:54.76
Uh, again that rotor wash can flip that boat. I put anything extra in it, uh into the bow of the boat

694
00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:58.92
And I would lean forward and holding on to the tiller it leaning forward into the boat

695
00:51:59.08 --> 00:52:02.76
You punch through that and it's a wall when you get through it. There's dead space

696
00:52:03.72 --> 00:52:07.24
So so you you've got a you got to make a right hand turn

697
00:52:08.12 --> 00:52:12.04
And gun it one more time until you're and you're in you're inside the helicopter

698
00:52:12.60 --> 00:52:14.84
It's like by yourself. It's pretty wild to do

699
00:52:14.84 --> 00:52:17.56
Um, and as a new guy, I mean this is my second platoon

700
00:52:18.12 --> 00:52:25.32
Uh, without a workup. So that was that was pretty wild and that whole so that those were air force spec ops guys

701
00:52:25.48 --> 00:52:27.48
And I know there was their big, uh

702
00:52:28.44 --> 00:52:35.32
Thing and it was uh, yeah, we did exercise with those guys too in the philippines. Um, you know the uh

703
00:52:36.36 --> 00:52:38.36
The c-130 that they had

704
00:52:38.36 --> 00:52:40.60
um, it got shot by

705
00:52:40.60 --> 00:52:47.56
You know npa or some farmer didn't like flying to serve in their jack or what you know, whatever

706
00:52:47.96 --> 00:52:51.56
Uh, uh, and uh, so it it took a round through and through the plane

707
00:52:52.92 --> 00:52:58.76
We never knew they they landed it patched it is their exercise and that thing was back up in the air

708
00:52:59.88 --> 00:53:02.92
When when an air force bird, you know breaks

709
00:53:03.48 --> 00:53:06.28
Um, and it's in a nice place like hawaii

710
00:53:06.92 --> 00:53:08.92
You're there for a couple days

711
00:53:08.92 --> 00:53:13.56
We never knew it even got hit. Yeah, you know, and this is training again. I'm not you know, it's uh

712
00:53:14.20 --> 00:53:16.20
um, yeah, that was that was

713
00:53:16.60 --> 00:53:21.80
Pretty wild now this didn't you fall somehow like a oh, yeah, what was that all about?

714
00:53:22.92 --> 00:53:24.92
ouch just um, so

715
00:53:25.72 --> 00:53:28.92
I always went off to uh, um, josh woodtree

716
00:53:30.12 --> 00:53:35.24
Or I had a while to go climbing on the weekends, you know, uh, Lou Langlis, you know talk. We were all in a

717
00:53:35.24 --> 00:53:37.24
Um

718
00:53:37.56 --> 00:53:42.28
Andy rios lou, um, who else was in the barracks? Um, you know

719
00:53:43.08 --> 00:53:47.72
Go off climbing on the weekends, you know, we were still in the barracks and the teams at that time

720
00:53:48.36 --> 00:53:51.40
Um, and so, you know off camping

721
00:53:53.08 --> 00:53:55.32
And I was a pretty decent climber right off the bat

722
00:53:55.64 --> 00:53:58.20
You know, my uncle up in canada would take me climbing

723
00:53:58.20 --> 00:54:04.76
And uh once in a while as a kid and uh, rarely but um, I just liked it and uh

724
00:54:05.48 --> 00:54:10.12
I went up there. No one no one could go climbing with me. So not cool. I just go find somebody when I get up there

725
00:54:11.24 --> 00:54:12.52
so

726
00:54:12.52 --> 00:54:17.88
I had the soloist, you know, it's a self-bolay device you tie off to the bottom and as you progress you keep putting

727
00:54:18.36 --> 00:54:24.44
Um pro in it's a camping unit. Um, and I did like a 5-8 and I funny. I remember the names of the climbs because

728
00:54:24.44 --> 00:54:29.64
I was like, uh, uh, Mike's books. It's on intersection rock right there in uh, in joshua tree

729
00:54:30.28 --> 00:54:34.76
And then I just hung dog this I got to the top set up a top rope

730
00:54:35.72 --> 00:54:42.92
Making it safer. Uh, and I just did like a Mike's books like a 5-8 and then the next one was like a 5-11

731
00:54:43.64 --> 00:54:46.76
Which is above my what I could do. I was a 10c ish climber

732
00:54:47.32 --> 00:54:52.28
Um, so I just kind of cheated my way up on that literally, you know, because you can you can hang on your pro

733
00:54:52.28 --> 00:54:58.12
Hang on your whatever. Yeah, well, you just pull on your rope a little bit because it's I'm self-bolaying top rope again. Okay

734
00:54:58.84 --> 00:55:02.12
Get to the top and and uh, you know, there's uh

735
00:55:03.16 --> 00:55:05.64
Lady who wants to go climbing with me. I'm like check, you know

736
00:55:08.04 --> 00:55:15.40
So it's all downhill from there. Yeah, so I throw my rope down and uh, I go do the down climb and I look up

737
00:55:16.44 --> 00:55:18.60
And there's my rope. It's caught in a crack

738
00:55:18.60 --> 00:55:25.24
All right, I gotta hurry up. I got the four pieces of pro that I set that top rope up with and

739
00:55:26.92 --> 00:55:34.28
I climb up there get to the rope put it back through the belay device and when you're when you're using that soloist if you're off track, um

740
00:55:35.24 --> 00:55:38.84
It drags so I'm in this bowl and there's a uh

741
00:55:39.96 --> 00:55:42.44
There's an overhang so I gotta reach out and around

742
00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:44.92
um, and

743
00:55:44.92 --> 00:55:48.44
I was doing it and it's actually a pretty easy climb is like a five seven

744
00:55:49.08 --> 00:55:54.36
Um, but I didn't feel comfortable with it and I had no idea what was really up above me. It was really

745
00:55:54.92 --> 00:55:56.92
It was dumb

746
00:55:57.16 --> 00:55:59.16
And so I said nope not gonna do it

747
00:55:59.88 --> 00:56:01.88
So I jumped back into that bowl

748
00:56:01.88 --> 00:56:07.32
But I took up the slack and that one piece of pro that I set in kept my feet from planting

749
00:56:07.32 --> 00:56:14.52
Um, but it popped that pro and I flipped out of there backwards and I uh

750
00:56:15.24 --> 00:56:17.24
You know, I'm 40 feet up

751
00:56:17.64 --> 00:56:20.28
And I I come against the vertical face

752
00:56:21.08 --> 00:56:23.24
I palm the rock broke my left wrist

753
00:56:23.64 --> 00:56:25.64
um tucked into a

754
00:56:25.72 --> 00:56:29.96
Good plf and I landed in this standstone wash and it

755
00:56:30.68 --> 00:56:33.80
Folded me like a book separated both my shoulders

756
00:56:33.80 --> 00:56:37.40
Um chipped my ankle and whatever else

757
00:56:37.80 --> 00:56:39.80
Um, that was a train wreck

758
00:56:39.80 --> 00:56:44.36
Um, and there was a class for guides just uh

759
00:56:45.16 --> 00:56:50.44
100 feet away and they got me the rest of the way down or they didn't have a part to go and uh

760
00:56:51.24 --> 00:56:53.24
I called, you know, and

761
00:56:53.96 --> 00:56:55.96
Ranger said hey, you know

762
00:56:56.44 --> 00:56:58.44
We've had a lot of people fall from there

763
00:56:58.44 --> 00:57:03.56
They either land here in the sand because if I went if I would have pushed off a little bit further

764
00:57:03.56 --> 00:57:06.44
I would have landed in the sand probably wouldn't have been happy either

765
00:57:06.92 --> 00:57:11.96
Um, and he said yeah, they usually live in the land over here or they land where you do and they don't

766
00:57:12.52 --> 00:57:17.40
Uh, just by chance I landed right in the middle of the wash. I was tucked into a tight plf parachute landing fall

767
00:57:17.80 --> 00:57:23.16
Um, you know just not recent graduate of uh, because this is my this is before my first platoon. Okay

768
00:57:23.48 --> 00:57:25.48
I was not gonna not deploy

769
00:57:26.04 --> 00:57:27.64
um, so

770
00:57:27.64 --> 00:57:33.72
I didn't want to go to 29 palms and get stuck out there. I called Gina whoop. Gina came pick me up

771
00:57:34.44 --> 00:57:38.76
and uh, was another team guy and uh, you know, so yeah, just dropped me off at Balboa

772
00:57:38.84 --> 00:57:41.64
I'll get it, you know, and they you know did a couple, you know

773
00:57:42.12 --> 00:57:44.84
Basically you get into going to Balboa on a saturday night

774
00:57:45.56 --> 00:57:48.68
What do you got there a whole bunch of colds a whole bunch of you know

775
00:57:49.24 --> 00:57:52.84
That's what they have for an option to get their kids taken care of and uh

776
00:57:53.32 --> 00:57:56.20
And go up to the nurse. You're gonna say when I've had to go Balbo

777
00:57:56.20 --> 00:58:00.52
I'm like a sat depending on what time it's like saturday at two o'clock in the morning

778
00:58:00.60 --> 00:58:07.80
It's like drunk sailors that are gotten fights beat up. It's like such a disaster. No, this this is this is early

779
00:58:08.28 --> 00:58:12.92
Our late evening. Yeah, so you're all right. They haven't gotten drunk enough to get end up in the hospital yet

780
00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:19.48
Yeah, but but I'm there and uh, uh, the triage nurse, you know says, uh, hey, I'm ed, you know, I'm uh, uh,

00:58:43.72 --> 00:58:48.20
Um, I fell 40 feet and a rock fall and my neck hurts. Sir

788
00:58:48.20 --> 00:58:55.08
Please don't move and they strapped me into a backboard when you know x-rayed my neck, you know, what else hurts, you know

789
00:58:55.16 --> 00:58:57.56
This is 10 hours after the fall

790
00:58:58.36 --> 00:59:00.36
Everything hurts

791
00:59:00.44 --> 00:59:03.40
And they x-rayed me they didn't find anything, you know, they didn't x-ray everything

792
00:59:03.40 --> 00:59:07.56
There was more things that hurt than than my wrist and my my ankle, you know

793
00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:12.28
But uh, yeah, um later on I found out so

794
00:59:12.28 --> 00:59:19.96
I went climbing two weeks later with my this is three weeks before deployment, but I had no strength in my left wrist

795
00:59:19.96 --> 00:59:21.96
I didn't know why

796
00:59:21.96 --> 00:59:26.28
And my little brother wanted to go pre-deployment leave we went up to canada went climbing, you know

797
00:59:28.12 --> 00:59:29.48
young kids

798
00:59:29.48 --> 00:59:31.48
Drive, but I deployed in

799
00:59:32.20 --> 00:59:37.88
And I think a total of three weeks. I got acupuncture like the next day because I could not raise my arms above my head

800
00:59:37.88 --> 00:59:44.92
Uh, you know, but I got acupuncture stuck a needle in my from an acupuncture student in Coronado, so that's good

801
00:59:45.64 --> 00:59:47.64
It worked. She's you know

802
00:59:47.96 --> 00:59:51.32
Anyway, yeah, yeah stuck a needle in my hand and my shin and

803
00:59:52.04 --> 00:59:57.40
All of a sudden I can raise my hands above my head and you know, we went on deployment

804
00:59:57.96 --> 01:00:00.12
And I had to do we had to do a prt

805
01:00:02.68 --> 01:00:06.52
And I'll tell you it on camera here I cheated I did not do the pull-ups

806
01:00:06.52 --> 01:00:11.32
I kind of cycled around but I did the run probably the slowest I ever ran three miles at that point in my life

807
01:00:11.80 --> 01:00:13.80
but I was able to pass everything and

808
01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:16.52
um

809
01:00:16.52 --> 01:00:20.04
Yeah, I so wrestling tournament the fleet comes into town

810
01:00:20.92 --> 01:00:22.52
and uh

811
01:00:22.52 --> 01:00:29.72
Carrier group so they all kinds of activities that don't go out in town and cause trouble. You know and uh

812
01:00:30.60 --> 01:00:32.60
So I'm wrestling in this tournament

813
01:00:32.60 --> 01:00:38.84
And I I re-agitated the break in my wrist in the first match

814
01:00:39.64 --> 01:00:42.28
And then in the finals I separated my shoulder

815
01:00:43.08 --> 01:00:47.000
And uh, I yeah, I bowed out at that time happily took second

816
01:00:47.08 --> 01:00:52.68
So I kept separating my shoulders like every three months one or left one of the right one left one of the right one

817
01:00:53.32 --> 01:00:57.88
You know, uh, just a young kid keep moving forward and uh, I was the corpsman

818
01:00:58.36 --> 01:01:00.52
But I didn't really know a whole bunch. You know, so

819
01:01:00.52 --> 01:01:06.92
Yeah, keep moving forward keep going. Yeah, so what'd you get do when you got done with that second platoon that team three?

820
01:01:07.80 --> 01:01:09.08
so

821
01:01:09.08 --> 01:01:11.08
second but so in between

822
01:01:11.64 --> 01:01:16.36
uh, those platoons I screened for for dev group. Oh, okay, and uh

823
01:01:17.72 --> 01:01:23.96
Yeah, they said we don't want you as a corpsman. Can you cross right? I said yes because I didn't want to be a corpsman

824
01:01:26.76 --> 01:01:29.64
I could have stayed, you know with more training and all that

825
01:01:29.64 --> 01:01:32.60
Okay, but but I just want to be a you know, arch-eyed team guy

826
01:01:32.68 --> 01:01:37.88
You had to cover your own evolutions back then and I never did because I always found somebody else to cover them

827
01:01:37.96 --> 01:01:43.24
You had to work at it though and I said I should not have to work to have someone else cover my platoon evolutions

828
01:01:43.24 --> 01:01:45.40
That's just the way it used to be from moons ago

829
01:01:45.96 --> 01:01:51.08
um, and so I screamed positive I jumped right into uh, uh

830
01:01:51.96 --> 01:01:53.56
Foxtrot platoon

831
01:01:53.56 --> 01:01:58.84
uh, did that the end of their work up really and then jumped right onto the deployment and uh

832
01:01:58.84 --> 01:02:00.84
I came back from that and

833
01:02:01.88 --> 01:02:07.40
young kid, you know, we never did a cqb work up. I made the mistakes I made and uh

834
01:02:09.16 --> 01:02:14.12
Then it's a you know, so I didn't make it through and then where do you want to go and uh, you know seal team four

835
01:02:14.36 --> 01:02:20.52
uh, just because the reputation and uh, um, I wanted to get to the east coast

836
01:02:21.16 --> 01:02:25.16
You know so they I think I put you know two and four and they said they'd give them whatever I wanted

837
01:02:25.16 --> 01:02:30.28
And I said let's go go to four and you know south america and uh, so I went and did that

838
01:02:31.32 --> 01:02:37.16
And then you so you show up at team four just back into platoon life. Yep. Um, hey, can you deploy in two weeks?

839
01:02:37.56 --> 01:02:38.68
check

840
01:02:38.68 --> 01:02:40.68
Have your uh, are you a six gunner?

841
01:02:41.16 --> 01:02:43.16
I am now

842
01:02:43.80 --> 01:02:48.76
So that's your for you're your third platoon if you get assigned as a pig gunner. Yep. Uh, uh, well, I mean

843
01:02:48.76 --> 01:02:54.68
I mean as a corpsman I wanted to carry the pig medical gear and everything else, you know

844
01:02:55.08 --> 01:03:01.56
Again happy new guy, but so so yeah, um, you know, I can work the pig and so I went out and uh

845
01:03:02.44 --> 01:03:06.36
Bought myself some uh, you know 200 round uh pouches

846
01:03:07.08 --> 01:03:11.64
and uh figured out made some gear up and off to deployment I went um

847
01:03:11.64 --> 01:03:19.96
And uh, yeah, can you be the diver up? Yeah, I could be the diver up. Uh, uh, you know, I was diving since I was a kid

848
01:03:19.96 --> 01:03:25.88
You know, um, I died. I think I qualified when I was 15 or 16 very comfortable in the water

849
01:03:27.16 --> 01:03:32.12
And uh, yeah, so so we I got dengue fever

850
01:03:32.12 --> 01:03:41.08
Bad deal. Oh, so what's the deal with that? Yeah, um, you know, uh, get bit by a mosquito and uh,

851
01:03:41.56 --> 01:03:44.12
You know, I got up to 106.5 temperature

852
01:03:44.92 --> 01:03:50.68
Bad deal, uh, not at that point though. So we were in Panama and I got I didn't know what I had

853
01:03:50.92 --> 01:03:54.84
I was just trashed, you know, um, just hot spikes

854
01:03:55.48 --> 01:04:01.48
Um, colds, I mean can't walking outside just go put a piece of mail in the mailbox, you know outside the barracks

855
01:04:01.48 --> 01:04:03.48
And I'm freezing and it's 98 degrees

856
01:04:04.12 --> 01:04:09.88
Um, and then you know go back inside the air conditioning and I'm just all of a sudden, you know, just up and down and up and down

857
01:04:10.28 --> 01:04:12.28
But then I got better

858
01:04:12.92 --> 01:04:15.48
So there's a trip to Colombia

859
01:04:16.60 --> 01:04:18.60
Can I get on there? Yeah, throw them on the bird

860
01:04:19.72 --> 01:04:21.72
When we landed in Barranquilla

861
01:04:24.28 --> 01:04:28.28
And they literally kicked our pallet off at the end of the runway because it was a very hot area

862
01:04:28.28 --> 01:04:34.44
Um, it just hit again, you know, I got better for like a couple of days and um,

863
01:04:35.48 --> 01:04:37.48
We got

864
01:04:37.56 --> 01:04:39.56
Can't trace a scheme or something

865
01:04:39.64 --> 01:04:41.64
Uh, the town we're in

866
01:04:41.64 --> 01:04:48.28
And my fever got up to 106.5 and uh, you know, it was the other new guy Corbin. I wasn't a Corbin anymore

867
01:04:48.28 --> 01:04:54.68
But uh, it's like, you feel good. I think I'll get better a little bit, you know, but yeah, I was iced in

868
01:04:54.68 --> 01:04:58.28
Luckily we were there with the SBU guys and uh

869
01:04:59.32 --> 01:05:04.12
Um, they brought an air conditioner, you know, we put an air conditioner in the building. We're in we're talking one dirt road town

870
01:05:04.12 --> 01:05:06.12
You know that tees into the river

871
01:05:06.84 --> 01:05:12.52
And uh, yeah, that was uh, does dengue fever stick with you for the rest of your life like uh,

872
01:05:12.52 --> 01:05:20.36
Not not you don't get this. Um, if you get it again, it's supposed to be really really bad. Uh, but no, it's not like malaria

873
01:05:20.36 --> 01:05:26.28
Um, but man, it takes forever to recover. So on that treasure month-long trip

874
01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:32.04
Um, so this is why I don't like freaking travel, bro. I'll stay right here. Well, I don't like leaving America

875
01:05:32.68 --> 01:05:37.000
My wife's always like, hey, let's go to this place. I might know. Well, how about you want to go somewhere?

876
01:05:37.16 --> 01:05:41.88
Panama's how about freaking northern california? How about, you know, how about we go to tecula?

877
01:05:41.88 --> 01:05:45.08
How does that sound? Yeah, she wants to go to some foreign place?

878
01:05:45.08 --> 01:05:49.56
Bro, I did all that. Yeah, and I didn't get dengue fever and I don't want to get it. No, I mean bad deal. Um,

879
01:05:50.44 --> 01:05:56.44
From from from seal team four. I've known somebody who's had everything like leachmen isis. Yeah, so back in the day

880
01:05:57.24 --> 01:06:02.20
In in the 90s. Well, even before that the teams were geographically oriented. So

881
01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:09.88
Seal team one was southeast asia seal team two was europe seal team three was europe

882
01:06:09.88 --> 01:06:16.76
Seal team one was southeast asia seal team two was europe seal team three was supposed to be southwest asia seal team four

883
01:06:17.32 --> 01:06:18.84
was south america

884
01:06:18.84 --> 01:06:25.48
And seal team four, you know had had done the stuff in panama had lost guys in panama had, you know, the

885
01:06:25.88 --> 01:06:28.92
The combat experience really right of the of the era

886
01:06:29.64 --> 01:06:36.12
Um, so I can imagine that probably played into your mindset of wanting to go to team four and and it spanish speakers

887
01:06:36.12 --> 01:06:40.44
Were going to team four right and I mean there was still, you know

888
01:06:41.08 --> 01:06:44.92
All the snow cap ops that they were legit doing, you know, whether it was just

889
01:06:45.48 --> 01:06:50.92
You know, I'm sitting on a mountain top of the radio or getting involved with the da. I mean that was happening

890
01:06:51.48 --> 01:06:52.60
Um

891
01:06:52.60 --> 01:06:59.08
And this was one of those gigs where we were going in to train in these folks and then we were going to go in as a radio relay

892
01:06:59.64 --> 01:07:03.80
Um, so at the end we were going in as a radio relay

893
01:07:03.80 --> 01:07:07.000
They sent me walked an insane amount and

894
01:07:07.80 --> 01:07:14.28
um, and I'm the 60 gunner and I've weakest snot from from dengue fever and

895
01:07:15.24 --> 01:07:16.28
um

896
01:07:16.28 --> 01:07:18.68
Sun up to sun down we did

897
01:07:20.20 --> 01:07:25.64
Ridiculous, so it's not it was not through the jungle. It was through the edges of open fields that had all these

898
01:07:26.28 --> 01:07:27.96
um

899
01:07:27.96 --> 01:07:31.16
Lava rocks, you know softball size a little bigger smaller

900
01:07:31.16 --> 01:07:34.12
To get into columbia at that time frame

901
01:07:34.92 --> 01:07:39.80
The marines controlled the mill group so to get access to the country you had to go through the marines

902
01:07:39.80 --> 01:07:42.60
Marines are trying to build the river in assault teams or rat teams

903
01:07:43.16 --> 01:07:46.76
So you had to take a marine fighting force with you, you know

904
01:07:47.48 --> 01:07:49.48
an 01

905
01:07:49.48 --> 01:07:51.48
you know uh

906
01:07:51.48 --> 01:07:55.32
staff sergeant and uh, you know a corporal um, so we

907
01:07:55.88 --> 01:07:57.88
tagged on and

908
01:07:57.88 --> 01:08:04.92
Yeah, two stayed back what you had your platoon right so you have a squad and how many guys did you have this was a squad?

909
01:08:04.92 --> 01:08:10.52
Okay, but but then we had all the sp you guys and we were so we were training the sp you guys was training their folks up

910
01:08:10.52 --> 01:08:14.76
We were training our folks up and you know, we were in the middle of 30 dudes

911
01:08:15.32 --> 01:08:18.68
um, you know plus on this uh hike

912
01:08:18.68 --> 01:08:28.12
Uh, and uh, uh, we never saw anything, you know, uh, we went in dry hole and and back out

913
01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.32
this marine uh lieutenant

914
01:08:32.44 --> 01:08:34.44
Read a book were seals

915
01:08:35.24 --> 01:08:37.24
Don't wear socks

916
01:08:37.32 --> 01:08:40.92
Uh, and uh that dude's feet were cas wrapped

917
01:08:41.56 --> 01:08:43.56
Just trash

918
01:08:43.64 --> 01:08:45.64
Yeah, bad bad

919
01:08:45.80 --> 01:08:47.56
bad deal

920
01:08:47.56 --> 01:08:49.56
Yeah, how far of a hump was it?

921
01:08:50.12 --> 01:08:52.12
ridiculous

922
01:08:52.44 --> 01:08:54.44
It was it was

923
01:08:54.92 --> 01:08:59.72
It was like 20 clicks we walked from sun before sundown. We did two hours in the daylight

924
01:09:00.36 --> 01:09:06.36
Through the night and then came up two hours after and we never stopped we got there dry hole turn around go

925
01:09:06.60 --> 01:09:11.56
You know the foot was open field, you know foot thing like 20k you got to condition your feet

926
01:09:11.56 --> 01:09:17.88
Oh, yeah, like a lot and then there's some advantages to it because socks hold water

927
01:09:17.96 --> 01:09:21.48
And if you're like working in the jungle, you can get used to it and you can be a good thing

928
01:09:21.64 --> 01:09:24.36
But if you roll out for your first time no socks

929
01:09:24.76 --> 01:09:29.72
Yeah, but but you guys were doing that because they weren't walking anywhere. Yeah, that's that's another thing

930
01:09:30.28 --> 01:09:35.24
literally, I mean swimming up the edge of the stream or the river

931
01:09:36.44 --> 01:09:38.44
You know 50

932
01:09:38.44 --> 01:09:41.32
Tops yards if not 50 feet

933
01:09:41.80 --> 01:09:48.68
Um doing the hit and back in the water again. There was reason for it. Um that this was known to be a long walk

934
01:09:49.96 --> 01:09:54.36
And uh, yeah, no his feet were not serviceable

935
01:09:55.56 --> 01:09:59.000
So you're you're down there. How many platoons do you do you end up doing at team four?

936
01:09:59.80 --> 01:10:01.16
uh

937
01:10:01.16 --> 01:10:04.04
Three I know one of the one of these platoons you meet your wife, right?

938
01:10:04.04 --> 01:10:12.20
Uh in between actually, okay. Well, how'd that go down? Yeah, uh, eod's uh explosive ordinance disposal guy married to uh, uh

939
01:10:13.32 --> 01:10:16.12
Spanish lady. My lily on it was up in virginia beach

Okay, and uh

942
01:10:20.84 --> 01:10:26.76
Yeah, so so I was trying to learn spanish, you know, I took a couple little, you know classes on it, but uh

943
01:10:27.32 --> 01:10:29.32
um, so I you know

01:10:29.32 --> 01:10:36.84
Yeah, it was perfect. You know, how did she get to become the virginia beach to learn spanish to learn english funny

945
01:10:36.84 --> 01:10:39.64
She knew uh another team guy's wife

946
01:10:40.36 --> 01:10:44.20
Um, and it was going to stay with them and it ended up staying with cheese

947
01:10:44.76 --> 01:10:49.08
uh, branquiseo and uh and his wife and then

948
01:10:49.96 --> 01:10:54.04
However, uh, uh the od guy and his wife introduced us

949
01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:56.68
Yeah, and she's from where?

950
01:10:56.68 --> 01:10:57.88
Venezuela

951
01:10:57.88 --> 01:10:59.88
Okay. Yep

952
01:10:59.88 --> 01:11:04.76
So she's got an interesting viewpoint on the way things go down from a governmental perspective

953
01:11:04.84 --> 01:11:10.92
Yes, she does and see what's happened to her now. She sees it's coming here man. She sees it's coming here and uh

954
01:11:11.48 --> 01:11:16.76
Um, yeah, we'll get into it later. I'm sure but definitely the big push to do this thing that we're doing now

955
01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:21.96
Yeah, that's gotta be crazy. Um, so you end up so you end up getting married to her. Yep

956
01:11:22.36 --> 01:11:23.32
uh

957
01:11:23.32 --> 01:11:30.68
Yeah, we got married and uh, you know, I was always trying to not get married because I'd like exactly what I do because I was always in a platoon

958
01:11:30.84 --> 01:11:32.84
you know and

959
01:11:32.92 --> 01:11:35.48
um, and at this point, you know, um

960
01:11:36.92 --> 01:11:43.32
Still happy being a platoon our first, you know first six months of marriage was all you know, I was in a platoon. I was on deployment

961
01:11:44.84 --> 01:11:46.84
Get back from that and

962
01:11:48.52 --> 01:11:50.52
At that point we still had training

963
01:11:51.24 --> 01:11:52.12
um

964
01:11:52.12 --> 01:11:54.44
at the teams and uh

965
01:11:55.16 --> 01:11:56.92
and so

966
01:11:56.92 --> 01:12:01.32
Team four it used to just be rotate out do a stint in training and then back

967
01:12:01.40 --> 01:12:08.44
I mean it was as really a crazy quick handover team four, you know, this is just before we started putting it to the groups

968
01:12:08.76 --> 01:12:11.08
And team four said no you're in training for 18 months

969
01:12:12.04 --> 01:12:16.92
Uh, which is right. I didn't have to like it, you know, uh, so I was in training and

970
01:12:17.56 --> 01:12:19.56
Marops I was like

971
01:12:19.56 --> 01:12:24.76
You know and and and diving I was like not what I want but but I made

972
01:12:25.48 --> 01:12:30.04
What I ended up doing with it is training it into, you know, even though there

973
01:12:30.92 --> 01:12:32.04
we had

974
01:12:32.04 --> 01:12:35.80
Turnover which was uh, you know minimal turnover of platoons back then too

975
01:12:35.88 --> 01:12:41.24
So we had a lot of folks could just do things, you know, you could do ops right at the beginning of platoon work up

976
01:12:41.48 --> 01:12:44.76
It wasn't gonna be perfect, but they'd figure it out. So I took um

977
01:12:44.76 --> 01:12:49.16
Marops and basically we ended up doing um

978
01:12:50.28 --> 01:12:53.40
Some down pilots with it, uh and other things we'd

979
01:12:54.20 --> 01:12:57.24
You know, it was any five and they just needed somebody in there

980
01:12:57.24 --> 01:13:00.04
They could you know, because what was any live fire in it?

981
01:13:00.60 --> 01:13:02.60
Although I didn't put it in there

982
01:13:02.76 --> 01:13:03.80
uh

983
01:13:03.80 --> 01:13:05.80
with the pat the

984
01:13:05.80 --> 01:13:15.16
Uh, the guy running that the the diving portion, you know, we were doing some sniper shots with uh diving our gear and doing some pretty complicated, uh, um

985
01:13:15.80 --> 01:13:17.80
You know, we'd get the

986
01:13:18.12 --> 01:13:22.12
Coast guard involved or the auxiliary which really is your personal boat, you know

987
01:13:22.12 --> 01:13:27.88
A bunch of older older dudes that that just wanted to do good with their personal boat and doing indigenous, you know

988
01:13:28.28 --> 01:13:33.08
We had a blast doing down to north carolina and doing a live fire shot, you know

989
01:13:33.08 --> 01:13:35.08
Um in town

990
01:13:35.32 --> 01:13:38.60
um, you know two e-fives you had to bring us a chief on board to

991
01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:44.68
Um certify the shot with good and safe and all that stuff, but we were just you know, you know, it was good, you know made

992
01:13:46.12 --> 01:13:48.36
Uh, you know adept winners got involved with it

993
01:13:48.36 --> 01:13:51.96
He was the the captain of the team captain at the time and he loved it

994
01:13:51.96 --> 01:13:54.60
And he loved the brief because I was always doing these curve balls in there

995
01:13:54.68 --> 01:14:00.76
Just not not straight on you get to have a happy successful training mission, you know, there's always a curve ball and I

996
01:14:00.76 --> 01:14:08.12
He wanted, you know, I briefed it that way and we did it that way and uh, he actually had his brother who's uh, I think uh

997
01:14:08.52 --> 01:14:14.44
He navy pilot, you know a 14 pilot at the time. I think it'd be the down pilot for us one time

998
01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.16
You know we're doing a bunch of stuff out in town

999
01:14:17.56 --> 01:14:21.08
um instead of just around the base and then you know

1000
01:14:22.28 --> 01:14:28.28
Turned in rectangles and triangles out in the ocean. We actually were doing ops. We went out to ches light

1001
01:14:28.28 --> 01:14:30.28
You know over the horizon

1002
01:14:31.48 --> 01:14:33.48
Launched off the whole piece

1003
01:14:34.04 --> 01:14:36.76
PCs and over the horizon

1004
01:14:37.64 --> 01:14:40.36
over the beach into back bay and

1005
01:14:41.32 --> 01:14:45.72
All the 75 nautical miles and actually did a pilot recovery

1006
01:14:46.20 --> 01:14:52.28
In the intercoastal waterways on a piece of property that I was going to buy and then later on a property that I bought

1007
01:14:53.08 --> 01:14:55.08
had him do reconnaissance on it

1008
01:14:55.48 --> 01:14:56.68
and uh

1009
01:14:56.68 --> 01:14:58.68
Just try to you know, um

1010
01:14:58.84 --> 01:15:04.84
It wasn't going to be regular old. Yeah more ops. Yeah, that's that's what it takes is guys that are going to take the training

1011
01:15:04.84 --> 01:15:10.36
And just step it up to the next level. It's always awesome. And the next folks took it even higher than that for me

1012
01:15:10.76 --> 01:15:13.08
That's the idea, you know always better better better

1013
01:15:13.64 --> 01:15:19.88
Uh without getting too many crazy drift into it. Then you end up you end up going to dli, right? Yeah. Yeah

1014
01:15:21.40 --> 01:15:25.000
My shoulders are getting really bad. Um, you know, I literally could move

1015
01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:30.68
You know like refrigerator magnets around anymore and uh, so I went out there and rehabbed

1016
01:15:30.84 --> 01:15:35.08
You know, that was the idea rehabs right there on the did you have to get surgery? Yeah, so I

1017
01:15:35.48 --> 01:15:39.08
I I didn't get soldiers. Yeah, they wouldn't do it. Um

1018
01:15:39.88 --> 01:15:41.88
I wanted to do it right off that deployment

1019
01:15:42.44 --> 01:15:45.40
And um, they wouldn't do it. They wanted me to do rehab first

1020
01:15:46.12 --> 01:15:52.44
And I got orders dli for the basic and the intermediate and I went out there with this is 97 ish

1021
01:15:52.44 --> 01:15:57.16
Uh, uh, something like that. Um, and uh, um

1022
01:15:59.16 --> 01:16:04.36
Yeah, taking her out there without fast computers and these you know phones you can talk to to translate for you

1023
01:16:04.60 --> 01:16:09.000
I mean dli's six and a half hours of Spanish a day every day

1024
01:16:09.64 --> 01:16:11.80
um and four hours of homework a night

1025
01:16:12.44 --> 01:16:14.44
uh and uh

1026
01:16:14.68 --> 01:16:20.20
Legit, I mean I can I I can speak and uh definitely with you know with my mother-in-law living in their house at

1027
01:16:20.20 --> 01:16:27.000
So various points in father-in-law. I mean I got it down and would your wife speak Spanish to you all all the time

1028
01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:31.96
When you got home from dli? Yeah, I mean so she spoke better English

1029
01:16:32.76 --> 01:16:36.84
When we met that I spoke Spanish so our natural language together was English

1030
01:16:37.48 --> 01:16:40.28
Um, it was kind of like the go-to when my brain got tired

1031
01:16:40.76 --> 01:16:44.44
But but uh, yeah for the most part I could say hey, how do you say this?

1032
01:16:44.76 --> 01:16:46.76
You know instead of you know

1033
01:16:46.76 --> 01:16:51.64
Um looking it up in the dictionary and figuring out how to you because you couldn't right now you just talk to your phone

1034
01:16:51.96 --> 01:16:55.08
And I'll tell you so so that was and that was cool

1035
01:16:55.16 --> 01:17:02.44
It takes you about four months to get it to click where you can actually go out and see you know, um

1036
01:17:03.32 --> 01:17:05.64
Yeah, Monterey and and everything else out there

1037
01:17:06.12 --> 01:17:09.96
Um, but man that that that was a great experience and it was just us no kids

1038
01:17:10.04 --> 01:17:13.72
It you know us and a dog when you're speaking when you're speaking Spanish now. Do you think in Spanish?

1039
01:17:13.72 --> 01:17:20.60
I can yeah, yeah, I don't speak it as much as I used to I am we're right now my mother-in-law is living with us

1040
01:17:20.60 --> 01:17:22.60
So it's it's back in the game again

1041
01:17:22.84 --> 01:17:28.60
Uh, because it's she speaking any English. She does it just it's never clicked with her, you know

1042
01:17:28.60 --> 01:17:33.24
I'm she's older and uh, she's always taken the the the classes. I mean

1043
01:17:34.28 --> 01:17:40.20
Genuine effort it's just not clicking, you know, um, but she can't and she can't get along but

1044
01:17:40.20 --> 01:17:44.60
She wants a brain to rest, you know, if you go when you go to a foreign country

1045
01:17:44.60 --> 01:17:49.96
And you are trying to speak in their language to whatever degree you can

1046
01:17:50.84 --> 01:17:52.84
It's tiring

1047
01:17:52.84 --> 01:17:58.68
Um, and uh, I mean I can speak, you know to the Cabo to the corporal and I can speak to the you know, uh,

1048
01:17:59.32 --> 01:18:05.48
Secretary of State uh in Spanish, you know, and I have you know, so it's varying degrees of Spanish, you know, uh,

1049
01:18:05.48 --> 01:18:09.48
What's the MOTJ?

1050
01:18:09.48 --> 01:18:14.52
Ministeria de Justicia and Gobierno. It's like the Secretary of State and uh, Secretary uh, uh, Justice uh,

1051
01:18:14.52 --> 01:18:22.44
All wrapped into one dude and you know as a chief, um, you get to talk to these folks and you're talking about how to

1052
01:18:22.44 --> 01:18:25.64
Develop, you know ranges in Panama or wherever

1053
01:18:26.28 --> 01:18:28.28
But man at the end of the day

1054
01:18:28.28 --> 01:18:30.28
Your brain is tired

1055
01:18:30.28 --> 01:18:34.12
Because all the colloquialisms for the different countries, um,

1056
01:18:34.12 --> 01:18:38.84
They all come into play you say one thing one country that that means something else in another another country

1057
01:18:38.84 --> 01:18:40.84
And you can get yourself in trouble

1058
01:18:40.84 --> 01:18:44.04
You know, but but it's a whole different animal once you get to speak

1059
01:18:44.92 --> 01:18:50.04
Uh, but uh, so the total time at DLI was how was the total time at DLI learned in Spanish?

1060
01:18:50.04 --> 01:18:54.84
Uh, 10 months. Yeah, I graduated the basic class early to because the

1061
01:18:55.56 --> 01:18:57.48
Intermediate class was was going to overlap

1062
01:18:58.28 --> 01:19:00.84
And so I jumped into that and then uh,

1063
01:19:00.84 --> 01:19:05.000
Again, it's just us two and a dog and a cat eventually

1064
01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:11.000
And uh, yeah, um drove back across the country

1065
01:19:11.96 --> 01:19:16.12
And uh said hey my shoulders are trashed so we cut on

1066
01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.72
Cut on both shoulders seven weeks apart

1067
01:19:20.60 --> 01:19:28.12
Um, just as I gained enough function with uh, my left hand, um, you know, they did the right one or whichever one it was

1068
01:19:28.12 --> 01:19:31.56
Um, and I've had it tuned up since I had another one done a few years ago. Um,

1069
01:19:32.36 --> 01:19:35.000
Yeah, it's uh, it's an ongoing problem

1070
01:19:36.28 --> 01:19:40.20
And we're and then obviously you go back to team four after you get done with DLI

1071
01:19:40.20 --> 01:19:42.84
I went back to team four, um, and uh,

1072
01:19:43.72 --> 01:19:47.72
Yeah, I went into uh, you're a chief now. No, uh, no, um

1073
01:19:48.76 --> 01:19:52.36
First class maybe first class. Okay. No second class. I was not

1074
01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000
Not a rate grabber. I was not a

1075
01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:59.64
I was happy where I was. I mean, I it was, um, happy with the leadership, you know, and uh,

1076
01:20:00.20 --> 01:20:03.24
I'm not always completely happy, but uh, I always say it. Um,

1077
01:20:04.12 --> 01:20:10.12
Yeah, you know, you really shouldn't be if you're happy with what's going on. Hey, uh, and it's working your team. Um,

1078
01:20:11.48 --> 01:20:17.24
Be happy with it. Uh, but when you finally decide at the end that you're not happy with it. It's kind of too late

1079
01:20:19.64 --> 01:20:23.64
So you're an e5 and now you go back to the team

1080
01:20:23.64 --> 01:20:28.28
for and then jumping into another platoon your shoulders healed healed up enough. Um,

1081
01:20:29.56 --> 01:20:30.60
So

1082
01:20:30.60 --> 01:20:37.40
I was an echo platoon knowing that I was going to get the surgery. They were a, uh, a cd counter drug platoon, you know doing stuff

1083
01:20:37.40 --> 01:20:42.44
mostly in the Caribbean and, um, the mass chief said, yeah, hey, we broke you. We'll fix you. And it was just the with the idea. Hey, um,

1084
01:20:43.16 --> 01:20:46.76
You know ed squared away. He'll do the paperwork whatever stick in the background.

1085
01:20:46.76 --> 01:20:51.08
And you know, he's a good guy. He's a good guy. He's a good guy. He's a good guy.

1086
01:20:51.08 --> 01:20:56.76
I let me do the paperwork whatever stick in the background. I got theßer surgery done you get a month. Um

1087
01:20:57.44 --> 01:21:00.20
Congolese, lean and I, you know, uh, I literally

1088
01:21:01.16 --> 01:21:05.24
I did the surgeries without any anesthesia. Just just the, um, the nerve block

1089
01:21:06.20 --> 01:21:08.36
Off the table and went

1090
01:21:08.36 --> 01:21:14.44
To the team, you know to to give them whatever paperwork and check him without I was just an you know, I was excited

1091
01:21:14.44 --> 01:21:19.36
the chief said that and I never took leave.

1092
01:21:19.36 --> 01:21:22.40
I just wanted to get signed up to start my physical therapy.

1093
01:21:22.40 --> 01:21:26.80
I did physical therapy twice a day at work.

1094
01:21:26.80 --> 01:21:30.24
Our medical's right in the middle of the compound

1095
01:21:30.24 --> 01:21:32.12
and I'd get a full session

1096
01:21:33.40 --> 01:21:36.88
and then I would get like a partial session

1097
01:21:36.88 --> 01:21:38.56
and then I brought my wife in.

1098
01:21:38.56 --> 01:21:41.12
They taught her how to do all the exercises.

1099
01:21:41.12 --> 01:21:43.72
I built a pulley at home, you know,

1100
01:21:43.72 --> 01:21:45.88
to pull my arm up and down, I built a finger board

1101
01:21:45.88 --> 01:21:48.04
so you can climb the wall with your fingers

1102
01:21:48.04 --> 01:21:53.04
and I mean, six months, you know, I did the PRT

1103
01:21:53.40 --> 01:21:55.96
and legit though, you know, they cut,

1104
01:21:55.96 --> 01:21:58.44
so they did a fully open, they did rock blazes

1105
01:22:00.48 --> 01:22:03.32
the same week, same doctor and they did his,

1106
01:22:03.32 --> 01:22:07.04
they scoped his but mine were pretty much

1107
01:22:07.04 --> 01:22:08.84
kind of collar bones were tent stakes

1108
01:22:08.84 --> 01:22:12.12
and you know, kind of big piece of cauliflower

1109
01:22:12.12 --> 01:22:14.04
so you wanted to get his big hands in there

1110
01:22:14.04 --> 01:22:15.000
and trim them down.

1111
01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:19.12
They remove your deltoid and I'm awake

1112
01:22:19.12 --> 01:22:22.04
and they have a Makita drill check

1113
01:22:23.44 --> 01:22:26.28
and they drill two holes at 90 degrees of each other

1114
01:22:26.28 --> 01:22:29.56
and then lasso that thing entire deltoid back down.

1115
01:22:30.76 --> 01:22:33.40
So it's because they want to get in there and see it all

1116
01:22:34.68 --> 01:22:39.68
and six months later PRT with, you know,

1117
01:22:39.68 --> 01:22:42.24
a very stern master chief there,

1118
01:22:42.24 --> 01:22:44.76
that's very strict on pull ups.

1119
01:22:46.72 --> 01:22:49.44
Yeah, 26 pull ups, 105 push ups,

1120
01:22:49.44 --> 01:22:50.84
the whole swim and everything.

1121
01:22:50.84 --> 01:22:53.28
So you were pretty much good to go six months later.

1122
01:22:53.28 --> 01:22:55.40
Yeah, I mean, I was tuned up and ready to go

1123
01:22:56.40 --> 01:22:59.36
and yeah, into the platoon, you know,

1124
01:22:59.36 --> 01:23:04.52
I even built before all the cool Connick's

1125
01:23:04.52 --> 01:23:07.92
box workout boxes, I went over to SDV

1126
01:23:07.92 --> 01:23:10.000
and got them to weld some stuff up, weld the bench,

1127
01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:13.40
they would collapse up and fit in one of those ISU 90s,

1128
01:23:13.40 --> 01:23:15.16
you know, built to pull apart

1129
01:23:15.16 --> 01:23:17.48
and go across the doors when you open it.

1130
01:23:18.48 --> 01:23:20.84
And should have patented that stuff.

1131
01:23:20.84 --> 01:23:23.92
Yeah, buddy, hey, you know, team guys are pretty innovative.

1132
01:23:23.92 --> 01:23:26.60
You know, Dane, a guy in my second platoon,

1133
01:23:26.60 --> 01:23:31.60
you know, he kind of invented the camelback, you know.

1134
01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.48
But what did he use, like an IV bag or something?

1135
01:23:34.48 --> 01:23:39.48
He used a two quart collapsible canteen and an IV tube,

1136
01:23:40.64 --> 01:23:42.76
you know, and had it on his back.

1137
01:23:42.76 --> 01:23:44.80
But hey, you know, you can,

1138
01:23:44.80 --> 01:23:46.28
it's cool to come up with the idea.

1139
01:23:46.28 --> 01:23:48.20
There's innovation, you know,

1140
01:23:48.20 --> 01:23:50.40
inventives and innovation, you gotta get it to market.

1141
01:23:50.40 --> 01:23:52.12
Yeah, well, there's the other's execution too,

1142
01:23:52.12 --> 01:23:53.72
because you gotta be able to actually do it,

1143
01:23:53.72 --> 01:23:55.000
you actually make it happen.

1144
01:23:55.000 --> 01:24:00.000
I always, you know, this sounds so obvious now,

1145
01:24:00.88 --> 01:24:02.56
but I was a radio man, right?

1146
01:24:02.56 --> 01:24:03.96
And so when I was carrying the radio,

1147
01:24:03.96 --> 01:24:05.36
I was gonna have my little flashlights

1148
01:24:05.36 --> 01:24:08.52
and do regular AA flashlights, little AA flashlights.

1149
01:24:08.52 --> 01:24:10.24
You put the red lens over them, you tape them all up.

1150
01:24:10.24 --> 01:24:13.76
So you'd be like a little pinhole of light.

1151
01:24:13.76 --> 01:24:14.68
Right, right, right, right.

1152
01:24:14.68 --> 01:24:16.04
But still you gotta worry about the batteries.

1153
01:24:16.04 --> 01:24:19.44
I mean, you go like on a four day recon,

1154
01:24:19.44 --> 01:24:21.68
your batteries are gonna, so it's a pain.

1155
01:24:21.68 --> 01:24:25.36
And I remember looking at the pilots with their lip lights,

1156
01:24:25.36 --> 01:24:28.08
just the little LEDs, and thinking, wow,

1157
01:24:28.08 --> 01:24:29.72
I wonder what that thing is.

1158
01:24:29.72 --> 01:24:32.20
And then by the time the war started,

1159
01:24:32.20 --> 01:24:35.40
someone made those little just LED click flashlights,

1160
01:24:35.40 --> 01:24:37.72
I was like, oh, that's the smartest thing ever.

1161
01:24:37.72 --> 01:24:38.60
Yeah.

1162
01:24:38.60 --> 01:24:42.96
And I had two ideas in my freaking head,

1163
01:24:42.96 --> 01:24:46.64
and they didn't connect together to say, hey man,

1164
01:24:46.64 --> 01:24:49.12
it's real obvious, here's a cool little flashlight

1165
01:24:49.12 --> 01:24:51.48
you could use and make it into like something

1166
01:24:51.48 --> 01:24:52.44
everybody could carry.

1167
01:24:52.44 --> 01:24:56.80
Yeah, you know, until somebody comes up

1168
01:24:56.80 --> 01:24:58.48
with the limpid backpack,

1169
01:24:58.48 --> 01:25:02.36
team guys were swimming with these bomb, with magnets

1170
01:25:02.36 --> 01:25:04.04
on their hands.

1171
01:25:04.04 --> 01:25:06.000
I've seen the drawings of that.

1172
01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:11.000
Rico, he invented the limpid backpack.

1173
01:25:13.60 --> 01:25:14.60
Simple idea.

1174
01:25:16.76 --> 01:25:19.16
A backpack with a metal plate in it

1175
01:25:19.16 --> 01:25:22.28
that you stuck this limpid explosive mine on it,

1176
01:25:22.28 --> 01:25:24.20
and you would swim with it on your back.

1177
01:25:24.20 --> 01:25:25.52
It seems so obvious.

1178
01:25:25.52 --> 01:25:28.56
It's so obvious because somebody invented it.

1179
01:25:28.56 --> 01:25:30.64
The chest seal, the Ashman chest seal,

1180
01:25:30.64 --> 01:25:31.60
this team guy invented that.

1181
01:25:31.60 --> 01:25:32.60
Yeah, the Ashman, yeah.

1182
01:25:32.60 --> 01:25:35.36
Made this thing that everybody carries now.

1183
01:25:35.36 --> 01:25:38.24
It seems kind of obvious, but you know,

1184
01:25:38.24 --> 01:25:39.88
everybody was happy with a glove.

1185
01:25:39.88 --> 01:25:41.24
Yeah, like a credit card.

1186
01:25:41.24 --> 01:25:42.76
Or a credit E-I-D card.

1187
01:25:42.76 --> 01:25:45.04
A credit E-I-D card, that's what I always tell it as an EMT.

1188
01:25:45.04 --> 01:25:46.92
Yeah, what a brilliant thing.

1189
01:25:46.92 --> 01:25:47.76
Yeah.

1190
01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:50.44
Not everybody comes up, well,

1191
01:25:50.44 --> 01:25:51.56
sometimes you come up with a great idea.

1192
01:25:51.56 --> 01:25:54.72
So you made your ISU 90, you're out there,

1193
01:25:54.72 --> 01:25:56.72
you're ready to work out of a box.

1194
01:25:56.72 --> 01:26:00.44
Yeah, and back with a platoon again, tuned up.

1195
01:26:00.44 --> 01:26:03.48
And you guys are doing counter drug.

1196
01:26:03.48 --> 01:26:05.28
What was that deployment like?

1197
01:26:05.28 --> 01:26:07.68
So it was just a bunch of little deployments.

1198
01:26:07.68 --> 01:26:09.24
They had the CD money, you know,

1199
01:26:09.24 --> 01:26:10.64
and then you named everything you bought

1200
01:26:10.64 --> 01:26:13.20
was a counter drug stapler, you know, a cow.

1201
01:26:13.20 --> 01:26:16.26
Ha ha ha ha ha.

1202
01:26:16.26 --> 01:26:18.08
You know, it was a different pot of money,

1203
01:26:18.08 --> 01:26:19.88
and you're going down, and...

1204
01:26:19.88 --> 01:26:21.04
You're doing recon's.

1205
01:26:21.04 --> 01:26:21.88
What are you doing?

1206
01:26:21.88 --> 01:26:23.60
No, we're just working with the locals.

1207
01:26:23.60 --> 01:26:26.52
It's really fit for an internal defense, really.

1208
01:26:26.52 --> 01:26:30.64
Just getting them tuned up and some huge exercises.

1209
01:26:32.24 --> 01:26:34.92
We would island hop for some of them.

1210
01:26:34.92 --> 01:26:39.76
And, you know, the Army has more commission ships

1211
01:26:39.76 --> 01:26:42.88
than the Navy, which is pretty wild.

1212
01:26:42.88 --> 01:26:45.04
Our Army's a big machine, you know.

1213
01:26:45.04 --> 01:26:47.04
Is it still like that?

1214
01:26:47.04 --> 01:26:49.44
I don't know, someone said it's not.

1215
01:26:49.44 --> 01:26:51.84
And I, no desire to confirm it or not,

1216
01:26:51.84 --> 01:26:53.08
but it's just a wild stat.

1217
01:26:53.08 --> 01:26:55.24
They have more helicopters than the Air Force.

1218
01:26:55.24 --> 01:26:56.20
I mean, they're a monster.

1219
01:26:56.20 --> 01:26:57.28
They're huge.

1220
01:26:57.28 --> 01:26:58.60
The big green machine.

1221
01:26:58.60 --> 01:27:03.60
So we would island hop on their LSU-2000,

1222
01:27:05.80 --> 01:27:08.000
the big giant landing craft,

1223
01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:10.24
and we'd get off there and go stay in a hotel

1224
01:27:10.24 --> 01:27:11.76
and go teach, you know.

1225
01:27:11.76 --> 01:27:14.84
And then another year we went to Belize,

1226
01:27:14.84 --> 01:27:18.60
and they had us staying in the middle of a soccer field

1227
01:27:18.60 --> 01:27:20.28
with countries, you know,

1228
01:27:20.28 --> 01:27:25.28
and a line of outhouses, not as nice.

1229
01:27:25.56 --> 01:27:26.92
Belize the islands, you know,

1230
01:27:26.92 --> 01:27:30.12
vacation land, inland, different animal.

1231
01:27:30.12 --> 01:27:32.20
And that was wild.

1232
01:27:32.20 --> 01:27:34.32
You know, there were some countries

1233
01:27:34.32 --> 01:27:36.04
that did not want to be there.

1234
01:27:36.04 --> 01:27:37.32
They just wanted the gear,

1235
01:27:37.32 --> 01:27:38.96
and they weren't there because they were told.

1236
01:27:38.96 --> 01:27:42.84
And, you know, that was like a hurricane disaster,

1237
01:27:43.64 --> 01:27:46.12
giant exercise where, you know,

1238
01:27:46.12 --> 01:27:48.12
terrorists take over the local school

1239
01:27:48.12 --> 01:27:49.88
while, you know, everything's going on.

1240
01:27:49.88 --> 01:27:53.08
And a huge monster exercise.

1241
01:27:53.08 --> 01:27:57.64
My first bout with Killer B's, you know.

1242
01:27:57.64 --> 01:28:01.32
Have you ever seen a swarm of Killer B's?

1243
01:28:01.32 --> 01:28:04.40
I think I've, no, actually no.

1244
01:28:04.40 --> 01:28:07.20
I've driven, remember in San Diego for a while,

1245
01:28:07.20 --> 01:28:09.04
Echo Charles, there was like bees?

1246
01:28:09.04 --> 01:28:09.88
Like so.

1247
01:28:09.88 --> 01:28:10.72
Yeah.

1248
01:28:10.72 --> 01:28:13.32
I've driven through some swarms of bees, you know.

1249
01:28:13.32 --> 01:28:14.76
And I don't know if it was quite the murder,

1250
01:28:14.76 --> 01:28:16.68
wasp, or whatever those things were.

1251
01:28:16.68 --> 01:28:20.08
But no, I've not dealt with actual legit Killer B's, no.

1252
01:28:20.08 --> 01:28:22.36
Cloud just coming across.

1253
01:28:22.36 --> 01:28:25.68
And yeah, one guy just screamed,

1254
01:28:25.68 --> 01:28:28.16
get in the vehicle or lay down flat.

1255
01:28:28.16 --> 01:28:31.52
And this cloud came over the entire field

1256
01:28:31.52 --> 01:28:32.52
and then just went away.

1257
01:28:32.52 --> 01:28:33.60
It was the craziest thing.

1258
01:28:33.60 --> 01:28:35.16
Did anyone get attacked?

1259
01:28:35.16 --> 01:28:37.96
No one got hit, significant that I remember.

1260
01:28:37.96 --> 01:28:40.04
It was just the weirdest thing.

1261
01:28:40.04 --> 01:28:40.88
But that happened.

1262
01:28:40.88 --> 01:28:42.60
So they weren't really living up to the rep.

1263
01:28:42.60 --> 01:28:44.08
No.

1264
01:28:44.08 --> 01:28:46.56
We were in, we were in Columbia once,

1265
01:28:46.56 --> 01:28:51.48
and actually doing, you know, kind of something, you know,

1266
01:28:51.48 --> 01:28:56.48
going in, you know, and the locals sat down on a hive,

1267
01:28:59.64 --> 01:29:01.92
an underground, you know, ground hive,

1268
01:29:01.92 --> 01:29:06.76
and jumped up and ran and left all their guns.

1269
01:29:06.76 --> 01:29:08.48
And I don't, you know, literally,

1270
01:29:08.48 --> 01:29:09.80
I mean, it was horrible.

1271
01:29:09.80 --> 01:29:11.24
It was a cloud again.

1272
01:29:11.24 --> 01:29:14.88
And we're in a bad spot, actually.

1273
01:29:14.88 --> 01:29:16.72
You can't be without your gun.

1274
01:29:18.08 --> 01:29:19.64
And so I've got-

1275
01:29:19.64 --> 01:29:20.96
Unless you're getting attacked by bees,

1276
01:29:20.96 --> 01:29:22.48
then you said hell with it anyway.

1277
01:29:22.48 --> 01:29:25.48
But it's also where these guys live.

1278
01:29:25.48 --> 01:29:26.32
Yeah.

1279
01:29:26.32 --> 01:29:29.08
You know, I mean, it's just, yeah,

1280
01:29:29.08 --> 01:29:30.56
just outside of Cartagena,

1281
01:29:32.32 --> 01:29:34.80
they take the mother ship down,

1282
01:29:34.80 --> 01:29:39.000
that's, you know, it's a sandbagged, big giant ferry,

1283
01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:40.80
and they take it down and in and go in,

1284
01:29:40.80 --> 01:29:43.44
and it's bad guy land.

1285
01:29:43.44 --> 01:29:44.60
Don't drop your gun.

1286
01:29:44.60 --> 01:29:46.04
But they did.

1287
01:29:46.04 --> 01:29:49.04
And so I've got my beekeeper's hat that I, you know,

1288
01:29:49.04 --> 01:29:51.36
when you want to relax in the jungle,

1289
01:29:51.36 --> 01:29:52.76
you throw that beekeeper's hat on,

1290
01:29:52.76 --> 01:29:53.88
it's your turn to relax.

1291
01:29:53.88 --> 01:29:54.84
It's so nice.

1292
01:29:54.84 --> 01:29:55.92
Yeah.

1293
01:29:55.92 --> 01:29:57.72
Don't like breathing the air back in on me,

1294
01:29:57.72 --> 01:29:59.28
but hey, I'll take it, you know,

1295
01:29:59.28 --> 01:30:02.32
and I've got my gloves and I got the, you know,

1296
01:30:02.32 --> 01:30:07.04
the tips cut off of index finger and thumb and middle finger.

1297
01:30:07.04 --> 01:30:10.12
And so Ed's gonna go get the guns.

1298
01:30:10.12 --> 01:30:15.12
And I've got my hands clenched, hiding those little exposures.

1299
01:30:15.28 --> 01:30:18.80
As soon as I reached out to grab one of the rifles,

1300
01:30:19.68 --> 01:30:20.96
I got whack, whack, whack, whack.

1301
01:30:20.96 --> 01:30:24.24
It was a great, they are just honed in.

1302
01:30:24.24 --> 01:30:25.56
And we spoke the area too,

1303
01:30:25.56 --> 01:30:26.88
to kind of try and calm them down.

1304
01:30:26.88 --> 01:30:30.52
The idea was, I don't know how much it worked, but yeah,

1305
01:30:30.52 --> 01:30:33.56
legit, not cool.

1306
01:30:35.52 --> 01:30:37.76
So what happens, you get done with Appletune.

1307
01:30:37.76 --> 01:30:41.44
So I got to fix my error, you know,

1308
01:30:41.44 --> 01:30:44.28
and I'm going back to Green Team.

1309
01:30:44.28 --> 01:30:48.76
And yeah, a lot going on in the household at that time.

1310
01:30:49.68 --> 01:30:51.52
I was building a house,

1311
01:30:52.40 --> 01:30:57.20
and I had drafting in like half a semester in ninth grade.

1312
01:30:57.20 --> 01:30:59.90
So I drew the complete plans to a house.

1313
01:31:00.88 --> 01:31:05.64
And yeah, not a great plan.

1314
01:31:05.64 --> 01:31:07.48
The house plan was great.

1315
01:31:07.48 --> 01:31:09.04
Green Team planned not so much.

1316
01:31:09.04 --> 01:31:10.60
Not at the same time.

1317
01:31:10.60 --> 01:31:11.96
Her dad was sick in the house.

1318
01:31:11.96 --> 01:31:16.96
So our first child was being born all at the same time.

1319
01:31:17.16 --> 01:31:21.72
And we're out at Shaw's doing a CQB.

1320
01:31:21.72 --> 01:31:23.84
And everybody's taking a nap,

1321
01:31:23.84 --> 01:31:25.52
and I'm talking to the plumber who's trying

1322
01:31:25.52 --> 01:31:28.20
to put a bathroom in the closet, literally.

1323
01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:36.000
The city held us up back because the city employees

1324
01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:39.64
disagreed with the guy with PhD in dirt

1325
01:31:39.64 --> 01:31:41.40
and said the septic field had to be this.

1326
01:31:41.40 --> 01:31:43.84
And so it held everything back.

1327
01:31:43.84 --> 01:31:47.000
And I'm doing this, I got 110 days leave

1328
01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:48.52
that I took to do this thing.

1329
01:31:48.52 --> 01:31:50.32
And I'm doing it in blocks.

1330
01:31:50.32 --> 01:31:53.08
You know, I'm relinquishing, you know,

1331
01:31:53.08 --> 01:31:55.92
what I'm doing, it's tilting for,

1332
01:31:55.92 --> 01:32:00.92
and just set a trip up, do the trip,

1333
01:32:02.20 --> 01:32:05.12
take two weeks of leave,

1334
01:32:05.12 --> 01:32:07.32
and just knocking it out.

1335
01:32:07.32 --> 01:32:09.32
Cause I'm talking, I'm digging the foundation.

1336
01:32:09.32 --> 01:32:12.68
You know, I've cut trees down, milled the trees.

1337
01:32:12.68 --> 01:32:14.16
I built the cabinets.

1338
01:32:14.16 --> 01:32:16.40
I built from scratch the stairwell.

1339
01:32:16.40 --> 01:32:19.04
You know, all the cabinets, all the window trim

1340
01:32:19.04 --> 01:32:20.96
on the first and second floor.

1341
01:32:22.28 --> 01:32:25.24
It cost 180-ish thousand to build it,

1342
01:32:25.24 --> 01:32:28.48
and it appraised for 720.

1343
01:32:28.48 --> 01:32:31.02
I sold it the next year when I'm up in,

1344
01:32:32.40 --> 01:32:33.68
or several years later.

1345
01:32:33.68 --> 01:32:37.96
So I refinanced it when I moved to Maine

1346
01:32:37.96 --> 01:32:40.12
cause I didn't want to have two home loans.

1347
01:32:40.12 --> 01:32:44.44
And yeah, so I did the refi for 720,

1348
01:32:44.44 --> 01:32:47.60
sold it the next year for 610.

1349
01:32:47.60 --> 01:32:48.72
Put it on the market that day,

1350
01:32:48.72 --> 01:32:51.34
and sold it in a day, half a day.

1351
01:32:52.52 --> 01:32:54.28
So I did very well with the house,

1352
01:32:54.28 --> 01:32:56.16
but smashing everything together,

1353
01:32:56.16 --> 01:32:58.96
Green Team and Tommy being born.

1354
01:32:58.96 --> 01:33:02.36
And yeah, I went home to see him.

1355
01:33:02.36 --> 01:33:05.84
He actually heard his birth over the phone,

1356
01:33:05.84 --> 01:33:10.64
and then flew in to make sure everything's all good.

1357
01:33:10.64 --> 01:33:12.48
I was supposed to try and be there,

1358
01:33:12.48 --> 01:33:15.20
but on the plane, pre-911.

1359
01:33:16.36 --> 01:33:18.76
Yeah, not a great plan.

1360
01:33:20.92 --> 01:33:22.16
But it worked out.

1361
01:33:22.16 --> 01:33:23.72
So where'd you go after that?

1362
01:33:23.72 --> 01:33:24.84
SDV-2.

1363
01:33:24.84 --> 01:33:26.68
Did you want to go to SDV?

1364
01:33:26.68 --> 01:33:29.64
Yeah, we were told we were going to be the snipers

1365
01:33:29.64 --> 01:33:31.24
for all group two.

1366
01:33:31.24 --> 01:33:35.40
And yeah, you said you heard that too.

1367
01:33:36.40 --> 01:33:38.04
Got to tell all the group two first.

1368
01:33:39.24 --> 01:33:41.16
All kinds of interesting things.

1369
01:33:41.16 --> 01:33:43.68
Yeah, you know, SDV's awesome.

1370
01:33:43.68 --> 01:33:45.06
Went to the SDV school,

1371
01:33:45.84 --> 01:33:49.72
which everybody there gets qualified to drive that.

1372
01:33:49.72 --> 01:33:53.04
And even though the plan was to be in the back,

1373
01:33:53.04 --> 01:33:55.84
just to get out of it and go do something and come back.

1374
01:33:55.84 --> 01:34:00.24
But it was neat to go to the school, learn all of that.

1375
01:34:01.48 --> 01:34:04.24
I did a platoon there, the war kicked off.

1376
01:34:05.64 --> 01:34:09.36
And we ended up, no one from the East Coast was going.

1377
01:34:11.36 --> 01:34:14.96
We deployed with Team Two, and I think they sent a squad.

1378
01:34:16.68 --> 01:34:20.44
At four, they sent a squad to Afghanistan.

1379
01:34:20.44 --> 01:34:22.08
And no one was going.

1380
01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:25.40
And we went to Kosovo.

1381
01:34:25.40 --> 01:34:27.64
And we were doing reconnaissance there.

1382
01:34:27.64 --> 01:34:29.76
Some of us were a little sketchy.

1383
01:34:29.76 --> 01:34:31.40
We were getting to use some cameras and do some things.

1384
01:34:31.40 --> 01:34:34.20
We were looking for specific people.

1385
01:34:34.20 --> 01:34:37.60
Some of it was walking around town, playing closed,

1386
01:34:37.60 --> 01:34:40.56
which we really hadn't had anything at that point

1387
01:34:40.56 --> 01:34:44.52
to just be a team guy in a foreign country.

1388
01:34:45.80 --> 01:34:47.92
That was easy enough.

1389
01:34:47.92 --> 01:34:51.68
Were you at SDV when September 11th happened?

1390
01:34:51.68 --> 01:34:52.76
Yes.

1391
01:34:52.76 --> 01:34:54.84
600 yard line getting out of the van

1392
01:34:54.84 --> 01:34:55.80
at Sniper School.

1393
01:34:58.08 --> 01:35:00.28
You were going through Sniper School?

1394
01:35:00.28 --> 01:35:01.12
Yep.

1395
01:35:01.12 --> 01:35:04.40
So when you heard that SDV was gonna be a Sniper's

1396
01:35:04.40 --> 01:35:06.68
for everybody, you said, oh, if I go there,

1397
01:35:06.68 --> 01:35:07.80
I can go to Sniper School?

1398
01:35:07.80 --> 01:35:10.96
They said you will go to Sniper School right away.

1399
01:35:10.96 --> 01:35:12.28
And that's cool.

1400
01:35:12.28 --> 01:35:16.52
Yeah, I know, Sniper School, I won't say it was easy,

1401
01:35:16.52 --> 01:35:18.48
because it's not, it's very difficult.

1402
01:35:18.48 --> 01:35:21.20
But our workups at Team Four were basically,

1403
01:35:21.20 --> 01:35:25.28
a lot of it was, especially the basic warfare part,

1404
01:35:25.28 --> 01:35:27.28
was mini Sniper School.

1405
01:35:27.28 --> 01:35:29.40
Really good marksman, really getting after it.

1406
01:35:29.40 --> 01:35:33.84
The month of field craft, and then another month

1407
01:35:33.84 --> 01:35:36.60
of land warfare, and then you get it all over again,

1408
01:35:36.60 --> 01:35:38.60
going back into the jungle.

1409
01:35:38.60 --> 01:35:40.64
That field craft that you needed, Sniper School,

1410
01:35:40.64 --> 01:35:41.48
was all there.

1411
01:35:41.48 --> 01:35:44.08
All the math was there for the shooting.

1412
01:35:44.08 --> 01:35:47.48
It was all taught to us over and over and over and over again.

1413
01:35:47.48 --> 01:35:52.48
So, yeah, I missed Honor Man by half a point.

1414
01:35:53.32 --> 01:35:54.40
For Sniper School?

1415
01:35:54.40 --> 01:35:55.24
Yes.

1416
01:35:55.24 --> 01:35:57.28
That's a bummer.

1417
01:35:59.88 --> 01:36:00.72
Yep.

1418
01:36:01.72 --> 01:36:06.72
And, you know, it was, yeah, a little bit

1419
01:36:07.28 --> 01:36:08.64
of love-hate relationship there,

1420
01:36:08.64 --> 01:36:11.96
because I was always trying to get the guys

1421
01:36:11.96 --> 01:36:14.76
on the reconnaissance side more reconnaissance work,

1422
01:36:14.76 --> 01:36:17.52
and not as TV support stuff.

1423
01:36:18.96 --> 01:36:23.60
So, then I became the LPO for all of it,

1424
01:36:23.60 --> 01:36:26.000
the whole task unit, and I had to shift,

1425
01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.000
and be nice to everybody.

1426
01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.24
You know, when you fight for your squad,

1427
01:36:30.24 --> 01:36:31.44
you fight for your potential.

1428
01:36:31.44 --> 01:36:33.36
So, you were like a recce squad.

1429
01:36:33.36 --> 01:36:34.20
Yes.

1430
01:36:34.20 --> 01:36:35.60
You were the LPO of the recce squad at first,

1431
01:36:35.60 --> 01:36:37.84
and then you became the LPO of everything.

1432
01:36:37.84 --> 01:36:39.24
Yeah, a whole task unit.

1433
01:36:40.20 --> 01:36:41.36
That was a good shift, too.

1434
01:36:41.36 --> 01:36:43.20
Did you guys go on deployment somewhere?

1435
01:36:43.20 --> 01:36:45.76
Yeah, we went to Spain, and from Spain,

1436
01:36:45.76 --> 01:36:49.20
we went to Kosovo for whatever it was,

1437
01:36:49.20 --> 01:36:51.56
couple of months, just doing reconnaissance.

1438
01:36:51.56 --> 01:36:53.36
But this is post-September 11th.

1439
01:36:53.36 --> 01:36:54.48
Post-September 11th.

1440
01:36:54.48 --> 01:36:57.52
So, you're freaking chomping at the blame.

1441
01:36:57.52 --> 01:37:01.44
Like, I went back to a team to go help out

1442
01:37:01.44 --> 01:37:05.12
where help was needed, and that should've been

1443
01:37:05.12 --> 01:37:06.60
where the war was.

1444
01:37:06.60 --> 01:37:10.32
And it wasn't happening for the East Coast for a while.

1445
01:37:10.32 --> 01:37:11.40
It was these Tuesdays.

1446
01:37:11.40 --> 01:37:12.24
And then,

1447
01:37:14.64 --> 01:37:17.64
then Buddy Miner was running the sniper school.

1448
01:37:18.64 --> 01:37:20.60
Solid Stone, and he said,

1449
01:37:20.60 --> 01:37:22.72
yeah, you come here and we will send you over

1450
01:37:22.72 --> 01:37:24.96
as soon as an opportunity, you know?

1451
01:37:24.96 --> 01:37:25.80
So, I went,

1452
01:37:27.72 --> 01:37:29.52
you know, would be the scout course manager,

1453
01:37:29.52 --> 01:37:31.68
and eventually the sniper course manager

1454
01:37:31.68 --> 01:37:32.92
managed the compound.

1455
01:37:34.20 --> 01:37:36.96
And, yeah, first opportunity, you know,

1456
01:37:36.96 --> 01:37:39.88
deployed to Afghanistan, took my whole,

1457
01:37:39.88 --> 01:37:42.28
you know, crazy sniper suite with me.

1458
01:37:42.28 --> 01:37:43.12
And,

1459
01:37:43.12 --> 01:37:44.16
37 weapons.

1460
01:37:44.16 --> 01:37:45.000
37 weapons.

1461
01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:48.000
Hey, it's, you know, yeah, you're Mark 11,

1462
01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:51.000
you're Mark 12, you know, you're 10 inch upper,

1463
01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:53.52
you're 16 inch upper, you're 300 win bag,

1464
01:37:53.52 --> 01:37:56.12
you're 50 cal sniper rifle, you know,

1465
01:37:56.12 --> 01:38:01.12
yeah, you're Mark 23, yeah, name something else.

1466
01:38:01.28 --> 01:38:04.32
And who'd you attach to when you got over there?

1467
01:38:04.32 --> 01:38:06.76
SEAL Team 2 and the CG SOTA, you know,

1468
01:38:06.76 --> 01:38:08.36
and I would just try and get out on everything

1469
01:38:08.36 --> 01:38:11.48
I would just try and get out on everything I'd get out on.

1470
01:38:11.48 --> 01:38:14.40
You know, I ended up, I ended up doing a lot of briefing too,

1471
01:38:14.40 --> 01:38:17.12
you know, it wasn't as, you know, cool as what I,

1472
01:38:17.12 --> 01:38:18.76
you know, was expecting, but,

1473
01:38:18.76 --> 01:38:20.84
you should have stayed in E5 is what you were thinking.

1474
01:38:20.84 --> 01:38:22.32
Yeah.

1475
01:38:22.32 --> 01:38:23.64
Yeah, yeah.

1476
01:38:24.64 --> 01:38:26.16
It was, you know,

1477
01:38:27.48 --> 01:38:29.60
but, you know, I learned a ton,

1478
01:38:29.60 --> 01:38:33.16
and, you know, I was happy to get out there and support

1479
01:38:33.16 --> 01:38:34.000
and be part of it.

1480
01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:38.84
And it's a wildlife experience, you know,

1481
01:38:38.84 --> 01:38:41.36
but yeah, I came back from that

1482
01:38:41.36 --> 01:38:45.52
and finished up at Snipers, I'll tell you what,

1483
01:38:45.52 --> 01:38:49.36
teaching folks and, you know, working with the cadre,

1484
01:38:49.36 --> 01:38:51.80
that that's a wild, wild experience too,

1485
01:38:51.80 --> 01:38:54.28
because our sniper school is legit.

1486
01:38:54.28 --> 01:38:55.56
Our sniper school is awesome.

1487
01:38:55.56 --> 01:38:56.48
Yeah.

1488
01:38:56.48 --> 01:38:58.36
And our snipers are awesome.

1489
01:38:58.36 --> 01:39:01.20
Oh yeah, no, you know, Brian Sargent came on board,

1490
01:39:01.20 --> 01:39:04.52
you know, shortly after I got back and took over

1491
01:39:04.52 --> 01:39:09.20
the sniper school, and that was awesome.

1492
01:39:09.20 --> 01:39:12.24
We just took it to crazy levels.

1493
01:39:12.24 --> 01:39:15.40
We were getting some 100% graduation rates,

1494
01:39:15.40 --> 01:39:16.68
which had never been done before,

1495
01:39:16.68 --> 01:39:20.64
usually lose 10% per major grade at the evolution.

1496
01:39:20.64 --> 01:39:21.48
And we were just like,

1497
01:39:21.48 --> 01:39:23.12
How'd you guys get it to 100%?

1498
01:39:23.12 --> 01:39:24.72
We learned how to teach better.

1499
01:39:24.72 --> 01:39:29.56
And we made sure the cadre was on the students, you know,

1500
01:39:29.56 --> 01:39:31.40
but we learned how to talk, you know,

1501
01:39:33.20 --> 01:39:34.88
don't think I'm being soft.

1502
01:39:36.32 --> 01:39:37.80
I'm gonna tell you right now,

1503
01:39:37.80 --> 01:39:39.80
Brian Sargent's one of my, you know,

1504
01:39:39.80 --> 01:39:41.44
longest friends in the teams.

1505
01:39:41.44 --> 01:39:44.96
And I know for a fact he was not being soft on himself.

1506
01:39:44.96 --> 01:39:46.56
He's not soft on anything.

1507
01:39:46.56 --> 01:39:48.88
He's not soft on himself and he's not soft on anybody else.

1508
01:39:48.88 --> 01:39:52.88
So if he's saying somebody did it, they did it 100%.

1509
01:39:52.88 --> 01:39:56.76
And yeah, learning how to talk to people right, you know,

1510
01:39:56.76 --> 01:39:58.56
assigning the right instructor, the right students,

1511
01:39:58.56 --> 01:40:01.56
we had the one-eyed sniper, you know.

1512
01:40:01.56 --> 01:40:02.40
Adam Brown?

1513
01:40:02.40 --> 01:40:04.88
Adam Brown got shot in his dominant eye.

1514
01:40:04.88 --> 01:40:07.80
And what does this team guy decide to do

1515
01:40:07.80 --> 01:40:10.44
when he gets shot in his dominant shooting eye?

1516
01:40:10.44 --> 01:40:11.88
I'm gonna go to sniper school.

1517
01:40:11.88 --> 01:40:15.44
Let's see if he's trying to get his eye healed, you know.

1518
01:40:15.44 --> 01:40:19.16
And so we teach him how to shoot left-handed.

1519
01:40:19.16 --> 01:40:21.08
Hydro became his, you know,

1520
01:40:21.08 --> 01:40:25.68
who's a freak of a human fighting brain cancer right now.

1521
01:40:25.68 --> 01:40:29.60
But a freak of a human and a crazy instructor

1522
01:40:29.60 --> 01:40:34.60
and taught the dude to shoot iron sights left-handed

1523
01:40:34.96 --> 01:40:37.20
and smoked it.

1524
01:40:37.20 --> 01:40:42.20
But he cleaned the shooting test, you know,

1525
01:40:43.12 --> 01:40:44.88
with the scope rifles, both of them, I believe.

1526
01:40:44.88 --> 01:40:45.72
That's awesome.

1527
01:40:45.72 --> 01:40:48.64
You know, you're talking out to a thousand yards,

1528
01:40:48.64 --> 01:40:50.76
just pinging on steel.

1529
01:40:50.76 --> 01:40:52.08
It's incredible.

1530
01:40:52.08 --> 01:40:56.52
And you know, snaps and movers out to 800 yards

1531
01:40:56.52 --> 01:40:58.52
with a 300 win mag at the time.

1532
01:40:58.52 --> 01:40:59.72
It was incredible, you know.

1533
01:40:59.72 --> 01:41:03.28
But, you know, Hydro found what he needed to say,

1534
01:41:03.28 --> 01:41:06.48
how he needed to say it to him, you know.

1535
01:41:06.48 --> 01:41:10.72
And Hydro's always someone that's on top of the students too.

1536
01:41:10.72 --> 01:41:12.16
You know, he's not gonna leave them

1537
01:41:12.16 --> 01:41:14.04
and go have a sidebar with a couple of instructors

1538
01:41:14.04 --> 01:41:15.16
figure out what they're gonna do tonight.

1539
01:41:15.16 --> 01:41:16.32
Yeah.

1540
01:41:16.32 --> 01:41:19.44
You know, and the instructors, you know,

1541
01:41:19.44 --> 01:41:22.16
a lot of them really wanted to, you know,

1542
01:41:22.16 --> 01:41:24.04
it's not as hard as it was when I was in.

1543
01:41:24.04 --> 01:41:26.80
And I go, yeah, dude, it's harder.

1544
01:41:26.80 --> 01:41:28.72
You're just instructing better.

1545
01:41:28.72 --> 01:41:33.72
And so we made up this test that wasn't graded,

1546
01:41:37.88 --> 01:41:42.88
but we were, under the training command,

1547
01:41:43.04 --> 01:41:45.12
you get three strikes.

1548
01:41:45.12 --> 01:41:47.36
And we don't think that's right for sniper school

1549
01:41:47.36 --> 01:41:50.80
because you can't have a third strike in a sniper shot.

1550
01:41:50.80 --> 01:41:52.76
And so we had, you know, a guy that made it, you know,

1551
01:41:52.76 --> 01:41:55.16
it was third time every time.

1552
01:41:55.16 --> 01:41:58.68
We made up an exercise, basically briefed the students

1553
01:41:58.68 --> 01:42:00.68
in the morning, hey, pull your rifles out.

1554
01:42:00.68 --> 01:42:01.80
This is what you're doing.

1555
01:42:01.80 --> 01:42:03.84
We're gonna put you in an urban hide.

1556
01:42:03.84 --> 01:42:05.000
And the base was awesome.

1557
01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:08.36
The base worked with us so incredible on everything.

1558
01:42:08.36 --> 01:42:11.96
I had a 20 foot bullet trap made on a trailer,

1559
01:42:11.96 --> 01:42:13.48
six and a half foot tall.

1560
01:42:14.32 --> 01:42:16.84
I made two of them that you could back together,

1561
01:42:16.84 --> 01:42:18.04
get a 40 foot runner.

1562
01:42:18.92 --> 01:42:21.44
So I would drive around the base

1563
01:42:21.44 --> 01:42:25.40
and made all the SDVs worked out, SDZs worked out,

1564
01:42:26.64 --> 01:42:30.24
where they would shoot a blank.

1565
01:42:30.24 --> 01:42:33.36
I would back the trailer up to where the blank was shot.

1566
01:42:33.36 --> 01:42:35.56
And I would go stand next to the target

1567
01:42:35.56 --> 01:42:39.72
and load a live round.

1568
01:42:39.72 --> 01:42:43.36
And I would stand there with my binaus, three, two, one,

1569
01:42:43.36 --> 01:42:44.60
execute.

1570
01:42:44.60 --> 01:42:48.24
And so we had to have trust that student

1571
01:42:48.24 --> 01:42:49.68
would not hit the window sill,

1572
01:42:49.68 --> 01:42:51.80
not hit the fence of the tree that it was weak.

1573
01:42:51.80 --> 01:42:54.36
This was short shots, 150 yards.

1574
01:42:54.36 --> 01:42:55.92
I mean, sniper easy shots.

1575
01:42:55.92 --> 01:42:57.96
But not when you're under pressure

1576
01:42:57.96 --> 01:43:01.12
and not whatever you did the night before, the day before.

1577
01:43:02.20 --> 01:43:05.28
But we wanted to be able to tell, you know,

1578
01:43:05.28 --> 01:43:07.76
parent commands, hey, yeah, he did.

1579
01:43:07.76 --> 01:43:11.84
He passed everything, but let's take a second look at it.

1580
01:43:11.84 --> 01:43:14.04
He's not safe enough to do this evolution.

1581
01:43:14.04 --> 01:43:15.48
And so I don't know where that went.

1582
01:43:15.48 --> 01:43:16.92
We did it when I was there.

1583
01:43:16.92 --> 01:43:18.24
I don't know where it went to after that.

1584
01:43:18.24 --> 01:43:20.000
So where are you standing with your binaus

1585
01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:20.84
as this shot's going?

1586
01:43:20.84 --> 01:43:21.72
Right next to the target.

1587
01:43:21.72 --> 01:43:24.16
Like two feet away from the target?

1588
01:43:24.16 --> 01:43:25.000
Yeah.

1589
01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:26.36
Yeah, that's a high level of trust right there.

1590
01:43:26.36 --> 01:43:27.84
Yeah, I did it all day.

1591
01:43:29.84 --> 01:43:30.68
They're my students.

1592
01:43:30.68 --> 01:43:33.24
Yeah, and our snipers are freaking awesome, man.

1593
01:43:33.24 --> 01:43:34.20
Yeah, and you're not, I mean,

1594
01:43:34.20 --> 01:43:36.44
so these guys are already qualified on the weapons

1595
01:43:36.44 --> 01:43:37.84
at this point.

1596
01:43:37.84 --> 01:43:39.000
They've got some stocks to do.

1597
01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:41.36
And they got like 50 cal week to do.

1598
01:43:41.36 --> 01:43:43.32
They're really qualified on the weapon.

1599
01:43:43.32 --> 01:43:45.04
This is where the question was,

1600
01:43:46.16 --> 01:43:49.28
can that guy, when we wanted to do it,

1601
01:43:49.28 --> 01:43:51.40
make the shot first time every time?

1602
01:43:51.40 --> 01:43:52.96
Because that's what you want for our snipers.

1603
01:43:52.96 --> 01:43:54.52
But they were my students.

1604
01:43:54.52 --> 01:43:58.68
And so I had to have the confidence in them

1605
01:43:58.68 --> 01:44:00.56
that they would do it, and I did.

1606
01:44:00.56 --> 01:44:05.04
And it was, yeah, I don't know.

1607
01:44:05.04 --> 01:44:07.36
So sniper school's morphed throughout the years

1608
01:44:07.36 --> 01:44:09.16
is all kind of just about the same.

1609
01:44:09.16 --> 01:44:11.60
Everybody tries to take it up to another notch

1610
01:44:11.60 --> 01:44:12.96
and make it better.

1611
01:44:12.96 --> 01:44:14.40
They're always fighting with the parent command

1612
01:44:14.40 --> 01:44:16.04
that wants more snipers through.

1613
01:44:16.04 --> 01:44:18.80
And, you know, but we'll always do it

1614
01:44:18.80 --> 01:44:20.44
without lowering the standard.

1615
01:44:20.44 --> 01:44:25.44
Yeah, I mean, obviously I had 13 snipers

1616
01:44:25.44 --> 01:44:27.36
when I was a task unit commander.

1617
01:44:27.36 --> 01:44:29.88
And like what a blessing from God

1618
01:44:29.88 --> 01:44:32.76
to have 13 snipers in the battle or a modium.

1619
01:44:32.76 --> 01:44:36.20
And you just can't ask for anything else.

1620
01:44:36.20 --> 01:44:38.72
So, and the performance was epic.

1621
01:44:38.72 --> 01:44:40.60
You know, the way the guys shot.

1622
01:44:40.60 --> 01:44:45.60
I mean, I had guys take shots at enemy fighters

1623
01:44:46.36 --> 01:44:48.04
holding children.

1624
01:44:50.04 --> 01:44:53.68
And using children as human shields.

1625
01:44:54.68 --> 01:44:57.28
And those kind of shots, shots through windows,

1626
01:44:57.28 --> 01:45:00.000
through vehicle windows, and just hitting the driver

1627
01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:01.16
and no one else in the vehicle.

1628
01:45:01.16 --> 01:45:04.96
Like just awesome, unbelievable professionalism

1629
01:45:04.96 --> 01:45:05.88
from the snipers.

1630
01:45:05.88 --> 01:45:07.24
It was just outstanding.

1631
01:45:07.24 --> 01:45:08.80
And you know, I always sit, when you start,

1632
01:45:08.80 --> 01:45:10.80
when you look at the schools that we run,

1633
01:45:10.80 --> 01:45:12.12
it's what you talked about earlier, you know,

1634
01:45:12.12 --> 01:45:14.32
when you were running Marops, you're like,

1635
01:45:14.32 --> 01:45:15.64
hey, how can I take this next level?

1636
01:45:15.64 --> 01:45:16.56
How can we do a little bit better?

1637
01:45:16.56 --> 01:45:18.16
How can I get more people more squared away?

1638
01:45:18.16 --> 01:45:20.44
When you look at seal breaches,

1639
01:45:20.44 --> 01:45:23.28
like the breaching schools, just awesome.

1640
01:45:23.28 --> 01:45:24.96
The sniper schools, awesome.

1641
01:45:24.96 --> 01:45:29.80
Just anything that you take a seal and you put them,

1642
01:45:29.80 --> 01:45:32.88
you let us run a course, it's just gonna get good.

1643
01:45:32.88 --> 01:45:33.72
We're just gonna get better.

1644
01:45:33.72 --> 01:45:35.04
Just constantly trying to improve.

1645
01:45:35.04 --> 01:45:37.24
And that's such a benefit for our community.

1646
01:45:37.24 --> 01:45:38.84
It's one of the best things about our community.

1647
01:45:38.84 --> 01:45:43.84
Oh yeah, the idea that the peer pressure,

1648
01:45:44.28 --> 01:45:46.68
that you're not gonna let the standard drop,

1649
01:45:46.68 --> 01:45:48.40
and that you are gonna provide something

1650
01:45:48.40 --> 01:45:50.04
that they've never had before.

1651
01:45:50.04 --> 01:45:54.16
And I mean, your reputation in the teams is all you have.

1652
01:45:54.16 --> 01:45:56.12
I don't care what you did yesterday.

1653
01:45:56.12 --> 01:45:58.000
You do something stupid a day,

1654
01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:00.12
everybody's gonna remember you for that.

1655
01:46:00.12 --> 01:46:03.28
You know, and if you slack off and you get,

1656
01:46:03.28 --> 01:46:08.28
you make an easy training for jungle warfare,

1657
01:46:09.64 --> 01:46:11.72
you're gonna get called on it.

1658
01:46:11.72 --> 01:46:14.60
I mean, those trainings that we got, all of them,

1659
01:46:14.60 --> 01:46:16.36
they've all been taken up another notch.

1660
01:46:16.36 --> 01:46:20.72
And the biggest challenge as a leader

1661
01:46:20.72 --> 01:46:23.52
is to make sure they don't get out of the lane too much.

1662
01:46:23.52 --> 01:46:24.92
That instructor drift.

1663
01:46:24.92 --> 01:46:27.80
Yeah, making stuff a little bit too crazy.

1664
01:46:27.80 --> 01:46:29.32
Kinda happen from time to time.

1665
01:46:29.32 --> 01:46:34.32
So you wrap up your time at Sniper School, what's next?

1666
01:46:37.32 --> 01:46:39.60
Then I'm off to Maine.

1667
01:46:39.60 --> 01:46:42.96
Ah, you finally get that goal.

1668
01:46:42.96 --> 01:46:44.16
Well, I hadn't had short duty

1669
01:46:44.16 --> 01:46:48.16
in what became 21 years a little bit.

1670
01:46:49.08 --> 01:46:51.96
And so, and I'm kinda broken at this point too.

1671
01:46:51.96 --> 01:46:54.80
You know, a ton of weight gain,

1672
01:46:54.80 --> 01:46:57.04
couldn't figure that out.

1673
01:46:57.04 --> 01:46:58.32
Like how much weight gain?

1674
01:46:58.32 --> 01:47:01.08
I was up to 275-ish.

1675
01:47:01.08 --> 01:47:02.84
Oh, dang.

1676
01:47:02.84 --> 01:47:05.68
Does that ish mean 283 or something?

1677
01:47:05.68 --> 01:47:07.04
Could be, you know?

1678
01:47:08.64 --> 01:47:09.96
I just couldn't figure it out.

1679
01:47:09.96 --> 01:47:13.000
My gut quit working, the anthrax vaccine, you know?

1680
01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:15.36
That was a series of six shots.

1681
01:47:15.36 --> 01:47:19.66
And all of a sudden, like I can have one beer.

1682
01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:22.76
And I really didn't figure it out.

1683
01:47:22.76 --> 01:47:27.76
We all went on the Atkin, the Fatkins diet, I call it.

1684
01:47:28.68 --> 01:47:33.24
And when we went to Kosovo on that deployment.

1685
01:47:33.24 --> 01:47:37.48
So I wasn't having any gluten, you know?

1686
01:47:37.48 --> 01:47:40.60
And when we got back, we went to-

1687
01:47:40.60 --> 01:47:44.16
And what effect did the Atkins diet have on you?

1688
01:47:44.16 --> 01:47:46.24
Did you shred off a bunch of fat?

1689
01:47:46.24 --> 01:47:47.72
We got crazy strong.

1690
01:47:48.52 --> 01:47:52.000
And I didn't know what was going on at the time.

1691
01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:55.12
So, and that was for several months.

1692
01:47:55.12 --> 01:47:57.72
Did you lose fat though, on the Atkins diet?

1693
01:47:57.72 --> 01:47:59.12
On the Atkins diet, probably.

1694
01:47:59.12 --> 01:48:00.92
I just noticed we got really strong.

1695
01:48:01.92 --> 01:48:05.44
I mean, no real notice to losing crazy amounts away.

1696
01:48:05.44 --> 01:48:06.88
That's the purpose of that.

1697
01:48:06.88 --> 01:48:08.76
I mean, that guy Atkins made that diet for people.

1698
01:48:08.76 --> 01:48:09.60
And it did.

1699
01:48:09.60 --> 01:48:11.20
I lost fat.

1700
01:48:11.20 --> 01:48:13.16
We're eating meat and fat.

1701
01:48:13.16 --> 01:48:16.12
Not to say that we followed it very strictly as far as,

1702
01:48:16.12 --> 01:48:19.12
I mean, the whole percentages and all that.

1703
01:48:19.12 --> 01:48:21.12
Like for the keto diet,

1704
01:48:21.12 --> 01:48:23.92
I'm like a keto kook and I'm rigid.

1705
01:48:25.12 --> 01:48:27.84
But definitely no bread, you know?

1706
01:48:27.84 --> 01:48:31.16
No gluten, no beer, no nothing, no pasta.

1707
01:48:31.16 --> 01:48:32.64
We go to Germany.

1708
01:48:33.76 --> 01:48:35.04
So you feel good too?

1709
01:48:35.04 --> 01:48:36.72
Feel good, okay.

1710
01:48:36.72 --> 01:48:41.24
And then we go to Germany, you know, decompress, debrief.

1711
01:48:41.24 --> 01:48:42.76
And how comes the Hefeweisen?

1712
01:48:44.16 --> 01:48:48.44
Out for some pasta and beers and Bubeligen in Germany.

1713
01:48:48.44 --> 01:48:51.32
And I didn't even make another restaurant.

1714
01:48:51.32 --> 01:48:53.20
I just started going to Heven.

1715
01:48:53.20 --> 01:48:57.52
And it basically shuts my gut down.

1716
01:48:57.52 --> 01:48:59.56
And it was years.

1717
01:48:59.56 --> 01:49:01.48
We didn't, you know, I wouldn't got my gut checked out.

1718
01:49:01.48 --> 01:49:03.60
Yeah, yeah, a little ulcer in there, you know.

1719
01:49:04.56 --> 01:49:05.40
Yeah, still stressed.

1720
01:49:05.40 --> 01:49:08.12
I don't know, you know, couldn't figure it out.

1721
01:49:08.12 --> 01:49:10.12
And I just kept throwing up all the damn time

1722
01:49:10.12 --> 01:49:14.24
and gaining weight and I'm eating healthy, you know?

1723
01:49:14.24 --> 01:49:15.16
I'm not drinking.

1724
01:49:15.16 --> 01:49:17.16
I'm working out like a nut.

1725
01:49:17.16 --> 01:49:19.48
And I'm just puffing up, the joints are getting,

1726
01:49:19.48 --> 01:49:21.28
you know, the head's getting foggy.

1727
01:49:21.28 --> 01:49:25.000
But at this point you're eating normal food.

1728
01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:29.40
Normal, regular, healthy American diet, you know?

1729
01:49:29.40 --> 01:49:34.40
Meat and potatoes, salad, you know, pasta, you know?

1730
01:49:34.40 --> 01:49:37.08
And just couldn't, but it's all healthy.

1731
01:49:37.08 --> 01:49:38.000
A ton of fruit.

1732
01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:40.04
And what are you walking around at right now weight-wise?

1733
01:49:40.04 --> 01:49:41.36
Right now, 205.

1734
01:49:41.36 --> 01:49:44.56
So you want to, you are 70 pounds heavier than this.

1735
01:49:44.56 --> 01:49:46.44
Oh yeah, plus, yeah.

1736
01:49:46.44 --> 01:49:48.68
And this is when you get orders to go up to Maine?

1737
01:49:48.68 --> 01:49:51.24
Yeah, yep, yep, I was gonna stay warm.

1738
01:49:51.24 --> 01:49:53.04
Yeah, you were extra layers.

1739
01:49:54.04 --> 01:49:56.20
Still, I mean, it's still strong,

1740
01:49:56.20 --> 01:49:58.44
but the swelling started, you know,

1741
01:49:58.44 --> 01:50:00.16
with the joints and everything like that.

1742
01:50:00.16 --> 01:50:05.16
You know, I mean, I'm dumbbell pressing 145s.

1743
01:50:05.64 --> 01:50:07.64
I mean, I was still freaky strong.

1744
01:50:08.76 --> 01:50:11.44
And that's picking up off the ground, sitting back,

1745
01:50:11.44 --> 01:50:12.80
and then sitting back up again

1746
01:50:12.80 --> 01:50:16.72
and sitting back in the racks, legit, you know, press.

1747
01:50:16.72 --> 01:50:19.44
That's funny, because I always drop those, whatever.

1748
01:50:19.44 --> 01:50:22.32
If we're over 120, they're getting dropped, I don't know.

1749
01:50:22.32 --> 01:50:24.60
They can't do it, respect to the dumbbells.

1750
01:50:24.60 --> 01:50:25.44
Okay, cool.

1751
01:50:25.44 --> 01:50:30.44
And no, it wasn't till, I don't know, maybe,

1752
01:50:32.76 --> 01:50:36.16
so we're talking 99, we got the anthrax vaccines,

1753
01:50:36.16 --> 01:50:38.08
and they cut mine off at the fifth shot,

1754
01:50:38.08 --> 01:50:40.20
they never gave me the sixth.

1755
01:50:40.20 --> 01:50:41.24
They just stopped doing it,

1756
01:50:41.24 --> 01:50:43.96
because it was causing a lot of problems for a lot of people.

1757
01:50:43.96 --> 01:50:45.88
Apparently it was a lawsuit too.

1758
01:50:45.88 --> 01:50:48.16
A lot of aviators had to stop flying,

1759
01:50:49.04 --> 01:50:50.16
but what it did to me.

1760
01:50:50.16 --> 01:50:52.40
Yeah, I don't know, I got it, no factor,

1761
01:50:52.40 --> 01:50:53.24
I never noticed it.

1762
01:50:53.24 --> 01:50:55.52
Yeah, no, so people are different, you know?

1763
01:50:55.52 --> 01:51:00.52
And yeah, it definitely,

1764
01:51:00.72 --> 01:51:03.12
something there that caused something different for me.

1765
01:51:03.12 --> 01:51:06.24
I think I got it when I went into boot camp though in 1990.

1766
01:51:06.24 --> 01:51:08.20
Was it, is that possible?

1767
01:51:08.20 --> 01:51:09.84
I don't think it was getting pushed then.

1768
01:51:09.84 --> 01:51:10.68
Okay.

1769
01:51:10.68 --> 01:51:12.80
It was the same one that they were giving the farmers.

1770
01:51:12.80 --> 01:51:13.64
You know?

1771
01:51:13.64 --> 01:51:14.48
Okay.

1772
01:51:14.48 --> 01:51:15.32
Dairy farmers used to get,

1773
01:51:15.32 --> 01:51:16.92
or still get the anthrax vaccine,

1774
01:51:16.92 --> 01:51:19.12
but not, apparently not this one.

1775
01:51:19.12 --> 01:51:20.36
Okay.

1776
01:51:20.36 --> 01:51:23.56
And once I figured it out,

1777
01:51:23.56 --> 01:51:26.80
Doc just said, hey, why don't you cut gluten out?

1778
01:51:26.80 --> 01:51:29.000
And this is 2012 timeframe,

1779
01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:31.32
so I'm walking around gaining weight,

1780
01:51:31.32 --> 01:51:35.12
and getting sore, you know, crazy headaches,

1781
01:51:35.12 --> 01:51:39.16
cut gluten out, bam, instantly lose 25 pounds.

1782
01:51:39.16 --> 01:51:40.000
No kidding.

1783
01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:42.68
And I kept on, you know, losing a little bit,

1784
01:51:42.68 --> 01:51:44.36
and now I'm a keto kook.

1785
01:51:45.24 --> 01:51:46.60
I mean, I'm strict.

1786
01:51:46.60 --> 01:51:49.60
Like there's no, there's no pizza night.

1787
01:51:49.60 --> 01:51:50.44
Nothing.

1788
01:51:50.44 --> 01:51:51.40
I don't substitute.

1789
01:51:51.40 --> 01:51:55.000
Not even just ordering an extra meat pizza,

1790
01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:57.08
and just scraping the cheese, pepperoni,

1791
01:51:57.08 --> 01:51:59.44
and sausage off into a bowl, and eating that,

1792
01:51:59.44 --> 01:52:01.32
because I'm known to do that right there.

1793
01:52:01.32 --> 01:52:03.64
Hey, that's all keto, and that's good to go.

1794
01:52:03.64 --> 01:52:04.96
I know it's good to go.

1795
01:52:04.96 --> 01:52:06.60
Yeah, I do the meat pizzas.

1796
01:52:06.60 --> 01:52:07.44
Yeah.

1797
01:52:07.44 --> 01:52:11.28
And, you know, with a side of guac or something,

1798
01:52:11.28 --> 01:52:13.40
you know, butter in my coffee when I'm traveling,

1799
01:52:13.40 --> 01:52:15.20
instead of MCT oil.

1800
01:52:15.20 --> 01:52:17.40
Figure it out, your diet's huge.

1801
01:52:17.40 --> 01:52:19.16
You've gotta figure out something.

1802
01:52:19.16 --> 01:52:21.20
You know, I never stop working out,

1803
01:52:22.20 --> 01:52:23.56
even though some things got, you know,

1804
01:52:23.56 --> 01:52:26.24
caused me crazy headaches, I find something else to do.

1805
01:52:26.24 --> 01:52:29.76
You know, find, you know, the blood flow restriction stuff,

1806
01:52:29.76 --> 01:52:31.72
and some sort of suspension trainer.

1807
01:52:32.60 --> 01:52:35.32
That will fire you up, you know, you use less meat.

1808
01:52:35.32 --> 01:52:36.52
The blood flow restriction trainer,

1809
01:52:36.52 --> 01:52:38.24
that's the, where's the katsu, right?

1810
01:52:38.24 --> 01:52:39.08
Katsu, katsu.

1811
01:52:39.08 --> 01:52:41.52
Katsutsu, K-A-T-S-U-U.

1812
01:52:41.52 --> 01:52:42.36
Right?

1813
01:52:42.36 --> 01:52:43.20
Correct.

1814
01:52:43.20 --> 01:52:44.60
It's like a little system, you put it on,

1815
01:52:44.60 --> 01:52:47.24
it's like a really strong,

1816
01:52:49.16 --> 01:52:51.12
what is that called, blood pressure.

1817
01:52:51.12 --> 01:52:52.44
Right, right, right, right.

1818
01:52:52.44 --> 01:52:54.64
Cuff, that squeezes hard,

1819
01:52:54.64 --> 01:52:56.44
and cuts the blood flow off to your lip.

1820
01:52:56.44 --> 01:52:59.36
Right, the idea is you cut it by 80%,

1821
01:52:59.36 --> 01:53:00.68
and then you work it.

1822
01:53:00.68 --> 01:53:04.64
Right, and then you work out with 20% of the weight.

1823
01:53:04.64 --> 01:53:06.92
So you're taking a load off your body,

1824
01:53:06.92 --> 01:53:08.32
but you're still getting a hard,

1825
01:53:08.32 --> 01:53:11.56
a mentally hard, and physically hard workout.

1826
01:53:11.56 --> 01:53:14.28
So you're not causing all that stress and damage,

1827
01:53:14.28 --> 01:53:16.88
and you're getting a legit workout.

1828
01:53:16.88 --> 01:53:18.76
I mean, the thing I do is 30 minutes,

1829
01:53:18.76 --> 01:53:22.36
I'll do some other stuff too, like with katsu bands,

1830
01:53:22.36 --> 01:53:26.76
you know, you can do the rower for 20 minutes, legit.

1831
01:53:26.76 --> 01:53:27.60
You're hurting.

1832
01:53:27.60 --> 01:53:30.56
Yeah, you mentally have to fight to finish.

1833
01:53:31.60 --> 01:53:32.64
Especially your arms,

1834
01:53:32.64 --> 01:53:34.68
because you can, arms you gotta watch,

1835
01:53:34.68 --> 01:53:36.40
you can cut the blood flow off,

1836
01:53:36.40 --> 01:53:38.40
your brachial arteries are easier to get to

1837
01:53:38.40 --> 01:53:39.40
than your femorrhoals.

1838
01:53:39.40 --> 01:53:41.44
Femorrhoals you literally can't cut it off

1839
01:53:41.44 --> 01:53:42.92
with a real tourniquet.

1840
01:53:44.28 --> 01:53:46.92
But there's some training to go along with that, of course.

1841
01:53:46.92 --> 01:53:49.24
I mean, just don't go ahead and start,

1842
01:53:50.40 --> 01:53:51.56
cut the blood flow off.

1843
01:53:51.56 --> 01:53:52.60
You all know what you're doing.

1844
01:53:52.60 --> 01:53:54.92
And my workout partner's awesome, Pat.

1845
01:53:54.92 --> 01:53:56.16
I mean, legit.

1846
01:53:56.16 --> 01:53:58.04
I was his client first,

1847
01:53:58.04 --> 01:54:01.84
as taking care of my neck, taking care of my hip,

1848
01:54:01.84 --> 01:54:05.72
shoulder rehabs, hip and knee rehabs,

1849
01:54:05.72 --> 01:54:08.40
and became a workout partner.

1850
01:54:08.40 --> 01:54:11.72
And so I've got a pro that brought me into it,

1851
01:54:13.20 --> 01:54:14.60
blood flow restriction stuff.

1852
01:54:14.60 --> 01:54:17.56
And there's crazy Doppler systems that,

1853
01:54:17.56 --> 01:54:19.28
a lot of it was pre-amputee.

1854
01:54:19.28 --> 01:54:21.84
This one system, can't remember the name of it right now,

1855
01:54:21.84 --> 01:54:24.000
but it's four grand, you know.

1856
01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:25.28
But it actually has a Doppler,

1857
01:54:25.28 --> 01:54:26.68
tells you what your blood flow is.

1858
01:54:26.68 --> 01:54:27.52
Oh, God.

1859
01:54:27.52 --> 01:54:28.36
You know, he was thinking of bringing

1860
01:54:28.36 --> 01:54:30.12
something on board for clients.

1861
01:54:30.12 --> 01:54:32.36
But you have to,

1862
01:54:33.28 --> 01:54:37.20
you really have to know that it's okay,

1863
01:54:37.20 --> 01:54:40.68
because the pain you're gonna feel in your arms, legit.

1864
01:54:41.92 --> 01:54:43.44
And you question it,

1865
01:54:43.44 --> 01:54:46.60
but if you have this Doppler, it says, oh, it's okay.

1866
01:54:46.60 --> 01:54:48.88
You know, if you do your capillary refill,

1867
01:54:48.88 --> 01:54:51.84
you get three seconds on it, you know, then you're okay.

1868
01:54:51.84 --> 01:54:53.88
You know, it just gotta know you're not,

1869
01:54:53.88 --> 01:54:56.04
it hurts, but you're not harming yourself.

1870
01:54:56.04 --> 01:54:56.88
Yeah.

1871
01:54:56.88 --> 01:54:59.80
Any workouts that cause questioning

1872
01:54:59.80 --> 01:55:01.08
are good, you know.

1873
01:55:01.08 --> 01:55:04.56
Like that 20 rep squat workout,

1874
01:55:04.56 --> 01:55:06.52
that causes questioning of life.

1875
01:55:06.52 --> 01:55:08.64
And like whether you wanna be, you know,

1876
01:55:08.64 --> 01:55:11.16
I've been doing that workout where I'm literally questioning

1877
01:55:11.16 --> 01:55:12.56
if I even wanna be strong.

1878
01:55:12.56 --> 01:55:14.52
If I even wanna be a man, I'm just like,

1879
01:55:14.52 --> 01:55:17.52
well maybe I could just hang up on everything,

1880
01:55:17.52 --> 01:55:20.64
just call it good, I'm just gonna become a whatever.

1881
01:55:20.64 --> 01:55:23.28
So, you know, take on a different course,

1882
01:55:23.28 --> 01:55:24.92
a different path in my life.

1883
01:55:24.92 --> 01:55:25.76
Oh yeah.

1884
01:55:25.76 --> 01:55:27.000
So workouts like that are good.

1885
01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:28.000
Yeah, no, no.

1886
01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:29.88
I mean, you've gotta do something.

1887
01:55:29.88 --> 01:55:31.40
That's like the greatest thing about,

1888
01:55:31.40 --> 01:55:34.32
you have to have some little piece of adversity, you know.

1889
01:55:34.32 --> 01:55:35.36
I don't care.

1890
01:55:35.36 --> 01:55:37.28
In Maine, you gotta go get the mail,

1891
01:55:37.28 --> 01:55:40.40
and you gotta, you know, and it's really cold outside.

1892
01:55:40.40 --> 01:55:43.04
And you know, we got chickens, or we had chickens.

1893
01:55:43.04 --> 01:55:44.60
I'd like to get them again,

1894
01:55:44.60 --> 01:55:47.04
because kids gotta get the eggs.

1895
01:55:47.04 --> 01:55:49.52
You can come into the house when you get off the bus,

1896
01:55:49.52 --> 01:55:52.28
or you can go get the eggs and come in the house.

1897
01:55:52.28 --> 01:55:53.48
But if you come in the house,

1898
01:55:53.48 --> 01:55:55.20
you're still going to get the eggs,

1899
01:55:55.20 --> 01:55:56.92
and you gotta put your boots back on.

1900
01:55:56.92 --> 01:55:59.08
And in the morning, before you get on the bus,

1901
01:55:59.08 --> 01:56:01.48
you gotta go change out, make sure the water's,

1902
01:56:01.48 --> 01:56:04.40
you know, not frozen, and replace it.

1903
01:56:05.40 --> 01:56:07.04
Good little responsibility for them.

1904
01:56:07.04 --> 01:56:09.32
Yeah, yeah, but it's a piece of adversity

1905
01:56:09.32 --> 01:56:11.84
that's easy, easy to overcome.

1906
01:56:11.84 --> 01:56:13.40
You gotta have something in your life

1907
01:56:13.40 --> 01:56:17.36
that makes and makes decisions.

1908
01:56:18.52 --> 01:56:19.52
Yeah.

1909
01:56:19.52 --> 01:56:23.04
So going back, you get this billet up to Maine,

1910
01:56:23.04 --> 01:56:24.32
which for people who don't know,

1911
01:56:24.32 --> 01:56:25.52
probably wouldn't, why would you know this?

1912
01:56:25.52 --> 01:56:27.16
There's a Sears School survival,

1913
01:56:27.16 --> 01:56:30.56
evasion, resistance, and escape school up in Maine.

1914
01:56:30.56 --> 01:56:33.20
And it's where the whole Navy, is it just Navy?

1915
01:56:33.20 --> 01:56:34.20
Is there any Marine Corps?

1916
01:56:34.20 --> 01:56:36.48
And then you get a couple, you know,

1917
01:56:36.48 --> 01:56:38.20
foreign nationals in there once in a while.

1918
01:56:38.20 --> 01:56:40.04
But they come like, for instance, aircrew.

1919
01:56:40.04 --> 01:56:42.08
If you're a pilot or you're aircrew,

1920
01:56:42.08 --> 01:56:43.88
you gotta go up to this school

1921
01:56:43.88 --> 01:56:46.96
and learn how to survive, how to evade,

1922
01:56:46.96 --> 01:56:50.000
how to resist interrogation, and how to escape.

1923
01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:53.32
I know I went, when I went to SEAL Team One,

1924
01:56:53.32 --> 01:56:54.28
when I was a new guy,

1925
01:56:54.28 --> 01:56:56.32
the first thing they did was send you to Sears School.

1926
01:56:56.32 --> 01:56:57.20
Great.

1927
01:56:57.20 --> 01:57:00.96
I went to the one that's out here on the West Coast.

1928
01:57:00.96 --> 01:57:04.44
And very, very good training, very thorough training,

1929
01:57:04.44 --> 01:57:06.04
very cool training.

1930
01:57:06.04 --> 01:57:08.64
But you ended up being an instructor

1931
01:57:08.64 --> 01:57:10.40
up there at that school.

1932
01:57:10.40 --> 01:57:13.80
And you show up there what's cool about this school,

1933
01:57:13.80 --> 01:57:15.60
kind of like being a Bud's instructor,

1934
01:57:15.60 --> 01:57:16.72
which I was never a Bud's instructor,

1935
01:57:16.72 --> 01:57:19.04
but you get a glimpse into human psychology.

1936
01:57:19.04 --> 01:57:19.88
Oh, man.

1937
01:57:19.88 --> 01:57:24.000
That, you know, I was talking to Andy Stumpf the other day.

1938
01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:26.08
He was like debriefing me on, you know,

1939
01:57:26.08 --> 01:57:29.48
he was a second phase dive instructor at Bud's.

1940
01:57:29.48 --> 01:57:32.60
And he could just know when he's doing pool comp

1941
01:57:32.60 --> 01:57:34.28
on something, he had all these different,

1942
01:57:34.28 --> 01:57:36.04
you know, he could just watch the way a person's

1943
01:57:36.04 --> 01:57:38.52
moving their body and know exactly what they're gonna do.

1944
01:57:38.52 --> 01:57:39.60
Oh, he's getting ready to bowl.

1945
01:57:39.60 --> 01:57:41.20
Oh, he's gonna pass out.

1946
01:57:41.20 --> 01:57:42.56
Oh, this guy's panicking.

1947
01:57:42.56 --> 01:57:45.12
You just see it over and over again.

1948
01:57:45.12 --> 01:57:47.68
And so same thing at Sears School,

1949
01:57:47.68 --> 01:57:50.92
you're gonna watch people from a detached perspective

1950
01:57:50.92 --> 01:57:51.76
because you're an instructor,

1951
01:57:51.76 --> 01:57:53.68
you're not all freaked out or engaged in it.

1952
01:57:53.68 --> 01:57:55.36
And you get to see how they respond

1953
01:57:55.36 --> 01:57:57.16
and you get to learn how, well,

1954
01:57:57.16 --> 01:58:00.12
the interrogation piece is huge as far as human interaction.

1955
01:58:00.12 --> 01:58:01.32
Oh, wow.

1956
01:58:01.32 --> 01:58:02.16
Everything.

1957
01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:05.32
So we conduct training to 50 below zero.

1958
01:58:06.60 --> 01:58:09.60
And just the idea of that for some point.

1959
01:58:09.60 --> 01:58:10.92
And we modify it.

1960
01:58:10.92 --> 01:58:13.000
You know, I mean, you don't just do the same thing.

1961
01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:15.72
The instructor's huge responsibility.

1962
01:58:16.76 --> 01:58:19.88
And you've got folks that have been cubicle warriors,

1963
01:58:19.88 --> 01:58:22.48
they're pilots, they signed on to be a pilot

1964
01:58:22.48 --> 01:58:24.20
or an air crew with a, you know,

1965
01:58:24.20 --> 01:58:25.12
a coachy seat and an airplane.

1966
01:58:25.12 --> 01:58:26.44
Oh, they definitely liked that.

1967
01:58:26.44 --> 01:58:29.24
And, you know, you get some,

1968
01:58:29.24 --> 01:58:31.12
you got some Marine recon to go through, you know,

1969
01:58:31.12 --> 01:58:33.000
used to get seals go through, still do.

1970
01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:36.64
Like we've talked about, they got their own course now.

1971
01:58:38.20 --> 01:58:43.20
And they're doing some things that are legit.

1972
01:58:43.20 --> 01:58:45.12
You know, you're making a snow cave

1973
01:58:45.12 --> 01:58:47.000
and that's where you're staying tonight.

1974
01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:49.000
And you watch people.

1975
01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:52.84
And this one, he was, you know,

1976
01:58:52.84 --> 01:58:55.08
going through to be a C2 pilot.

1977
01:58:55.08 --> 01:58:58.92
And he did not want to stay outside that night.

1978
01:58:58.92 --> 01:59:00.20
And he was trying to sleep

1979
01:59:00.20 --> 01:59:02.64
because you have these Adirondack shelters,

1980
01:59:02.64 --> 01:59:04.000
which is actually going to be colder

1981
01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:06.16
and you're cramped in with all these other people.

1982
01:59:06.16 --> 01:59:09.08
But there's, it's off the ground

1983
01:59:09.08 --> 01:59:11.12
and there's only insulation under the floor.

1984
01:59:11.12 --> 01:59:12.72
So you're just, you're going to freeze.

1985
01:59:12.72 --> 01:59:15.88
You make a snow cave and you're going to be happy as happy.

1986
01:59:15.88 --> 01:59:17.40
You're going to be, your body's going to warm it up.

1987
01:59:17.40 --> 01:59:19.68
You just have to have the confidence to do that.

1988
01:59:19.68 --> 01:59:22.44
And watching somebody try and slow roll it.

1989
01:59:22.44 --> 01:59:26.28
And I go, hey, tonight you're sleeping here.

1990
01:59:26.28 --> 01:59:28.48
Whether you get this done in the daytime

1991
01:59:28.48 --> 01:59:31.32
or you get it done at night, you'll be happier.

1992
01:59:32.92 --> 01:59:34.32
I'm doing you a favor.

1993
01:59:34.32 --> 01:59:37.16
And you, but watching their minds work,

1994
01:59:37.16 --> 01:59:39.48
watching people try and attach themselves to people

1995
01:59:39.48 --> 01:59:42.76
so they can get through, you know,

1996
01:59:42.76 --> 01:59:46.20
like, cause there were still team guys going through.

1997
01:59:46.20 --> 01:59:49.60
And, you know, people want to attach themselves

1998
01:59:49.60 --> 01:59:51.68
to that team guy cause they're going to drag them through.

1999
01:59:51.68 --> 01:59:54.16
But if you can't do what that team guy's going to do,

2000
01:59:55.08 --> 01:59:57.40
especially when you go on two brand of Asian,

2001
01:59:58.24 --> 02:00:01.72
you know, it's, yeah, it's wild to see.

2002
02:00:01.72 --> 02:00:05.88
And when they are in the captivity portion,

2003
02:00:05.88 --> 02:00:08.16
you know, watching what happens,

2004
02:00:09.28 --> 02:00:10.84
you know, either diamond people out,

2005
02:00:10.84 --> 02:00:13.36
then you don't need, people really get into the problem.

2006
02:00:13.36 --> 02:00:17.04
And they really, I mean, there's a little made up language,

2007
02:00:17.04 --> 02:00:19.72
you know, it's got like 150 words.

2008
02:00:19.72 --> 02:00:23.36
And they don't come out of character at all.

2009
02:00:23.36 --> 02:00:26.32
The first time you see some of these people

2010
02:00:26.32 --> 02:00:28.64
cause they hide them and they come into the back of the building

2011
02:00:28.64 --> 02:00:31.40
that students never see them in the classroom portion.

2012
02:00:31.40 --> 02:00:33.64
And the first time they see them, they're in character.

2013
02:00:33.64 --> 02:00:35.72
And yeah, it's, it's-

2014
02:00:35.72 --> 02:00:37.76
Are you guys doing the Eastern block thing still?

2015
02:00:37.76 --> 02:00:38.68
Yeah, man.

2016
02:00:38.68 --> 02:00:40.48
They couldn't get away from it.

2017
02:00:40.48 --> 02:00:42.000
You know, it's a vehicle.

2018
02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:44.76
But I was like, you know,

2019
02:00:44.76 --> 02:00:46.64
that's what the war is going on right now.

2020
02:00:46.64 --> 02:00:48.36
I was telling you, I mean,

2021
02:00:48.36 --> 02:00:50.000
when I went to Sierra school and you get,

2022
02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:51.76
you have to turn, if you don't get captured by certain time,

2023
02:00:51.76 --> 02:00:52.60
you gotta turn yourself in.

2024
02:00:52.60 --> 02:00:54.36
They put me in a truck, they pull us out.

2025
02:00:54.36 --> 02:00:56.36
They put me against the wall.

2026
02:00:56.36 --> 02:00:59.40
And this guy's like, they asked me a question.

2027
02:00:59.40 --> 02:01:02.16
And you know me, I'm freaking 19 years old, you know,

2028
02:01:02.16 --> 02:01:04.08
just got out of buds and I'm just like,

2029
02:01:04.08 --> 02:01:06.08
what's this dude's gonna do to me?

2030
02:01:06.08 --> 02:01:08.04
And I gave him some wise ass answer.

2031
02:01:08.04 --> 02:01:09.68
Bwack!

2032
02:01:09.68 --> 02:01:13.20
He slapped me as hard as he could.

2033
02:01:13.20 --> 02:01:14.28
I mean, look, I've been punched.

2034
02:01:14.28 --> 02:01:15.68
I've been slapped many times,

2035
02:01:15.68 --> 02:01:17.12
where I've been punched in the face.

2036
02:01:17.12 --> 02:01:20.48
This was as hard, you know, this was an open-handed slap.

2037
02:01:20.48 --> 02:01:22.56
And he did it like three or four more times.

2038
02:01:22.56 --> 02:01:23.96
And I was like, okay,

2039
02:01:23.96 --> 02:01:26.52
I guess I'm gonna have to freaking chill out a little bit

2040
02:01:26.52 --> 02:01:30.12
because my bro right here is ready to get it on.

2041
02:01:30.12 --> 02:01:34.28
Yeah, basically, if you're getting some extra treatment,

2042
02:01:34.28 --> 02:01:36.88
then you're not doing it right.

2043
02:01:36.88 --> 02:01:38.76
Something, you know, because it's not about being tough.

2044
02:01:38.76 --> 02:01:39.76
You're a punk as well.

2045
02:01:39.76 --> 02:01:41.44
Well, from my case, what I was not doing right

2046
02:01:41.44 --> 02:01:44.96
was I was not being humble and respectful

2047
02:01:44.96 --> 02:01:47.24
and treating the thing as if it was real.

2048
02:01:47.24 --> 02:01:49.24
I was just like, whatever.

2049
02:01:49.24 --> 02:01:53.000
Okay, okay, 100%.

2050
02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:53.84
I'm in.

2051
02:01:53.84 --> 02:01:56.80
There's, you know, the tough marine mentality, you know,

2052
02:01:56.80 --> 02:01:58.72
which is good to have, but you gotta know when to say,

2053
02:01:58.72 --> 02:02:02.000
hey, that's not gonna work in this situation.

2054
02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:04.64
And using those tools and techniques, you know,

2055
02:02:04.64 --> 02:02:08.36
to be polite, you know.

2056
02:02:08.36 --> 02:02:10.28
Give me a rundown of interrogation techniques

2057
02:02:10.28 --> 02:02:11.12
that you like.

2058
02:02:12.40 --> 02:02:13.88
I like the nice guy interrogator.

2059
02:02:13.88 --> 02:02:17.56
I said I wouldn't go do the hard side, you know.

2060
02:02:17.56 --> 02:02:20.28
Basically, I taught the camping part first, you know,

2061
02:02:20.28 --> 02:02:23.04
and then I went and did that deployment we talked about,

2062
02:02:23.04 --> 02:02:24.88
you know, I've never been away from,

2063
02:02:24.88 --> 02:02:29.88
we get in that later, but I like the simple soft sell approach,

2064
02:02:31.84 --> 02:02:33.44
just talking to folks.

2065
02:02:33.44 --> 02:02:36.12
And it's really the way you order questions, you know,

2066
02:02:36.12 --> 02:02:38.80
that read technique where you really give somebody

2067
02:02:38.80 --> 02:02:42.24
a reason why they did something they did wrong.

2068
02:02:42.24 --> 02:02:44.20
Kind of give them a way out,

2069
02:02:44.20 --> 02:02:46.80
but leading them to admit to something they did wrong.

2070
02:02:47.84 --> 02:02:52.04
It's, that soft sell is magic.

2071
02:02:52.04 --> 02:02:53.88
It's really just a conversation.

2072
02:02:53.88 --> 02:02:56.12
Cause I'd be like the first person that they've seen

2073
02:02:56.12 --> 02:02:59.72
that's nice to them after they've, you know.

2074
02:02:59.72 --> 02:03:02.16
Been slapped around and all of a sudden you're doing cool.

2075
02:03:02.16 --> 02:03:03.68
Like, hey, I understand.

2076
02:03:03.68 --> 02:03:08.32
I understand why, you know, you've been isolated

2077
02:03:08.32 --> 02:03:09.44
and kept away from everybody.

2078
02:03:09.44 --> 02:03:11.04
You heard probably the coughing, you know,

2079
02:03:11.04 --> 02:03:12.68
so we have to keep you away from everybody

2080
02:03:12.68 --> 02:03:14.12
and we had to take away all your stuff

2081
02:03:14.12 --> 02:03:17.28
and make sure you're all clean and good.

2082
02:03:17.28 --> 02:03:20.52
And, you know, and there's purposely a camera

2083
02:03:20.52 --> 02:03:22.56
with a red light on it that they can see.

2084
02:03:22.56 --> 02:03:24.56
And they're admitting to different things.

2085
02:03:24.56 --> 02:03:29.56
And it's really, it's wild to see.

2086
02:03:29.60 --> 02:03:33.64
It's way beyond what a lot of the instructors think it is.

2087
02:03:33.64 --> 02:03:36.44
It's how to get through roadblocks,

2088
02:03:36.44 --> 02:03:38.08
how to get yourself out of a ticket.

2089
02:03:38.08 --> 02:03:43.08
It's how to, you know, it's everyday instances.

2090
02:03:43.68 --> 02:03:45.24
It's a job interview.

2091
02:03:45.24 --> 02:03:48.40
It's really sitting across the table right now

2092
02:03:48.40 --> 02:03:51.44
and thinking slowly, you know, sometimes if I ask a question

2093
02:03:51.44 --> 02:03:52.88
I might swallow or take a drink of water

2094
02:03:52.88 --> 02:03:54.76
so I can think for a half a second

2095
02:03:54.76 --> 02:03:56.96
and come up with that, you know, better,

2096
02:03:56.96 --> 02:03:57.80
polite or answer.

2097
02:03:57.80 --> 02:03:59.72
It's keeping that military bearing

2098
02:03:59.72 --> 02:04:04.72
and not, you know, being starting a fight, you know,

2099
02:04:05.36 --> 02:04:08.68
that helps you out a crazy amount.

2100
02:04:08.68 --> 02:04:11.40
Yeah, we've had some POWs on here,

2101
02:04:11.40 --> 02:04:14.52
mainly from, actually I think all the POWs

2102
02:04:14.52 --> 02:04:16.48
have from the Vietnam War.

2103
02:04:16.48 --> 02:04:18.48
And it's incredible to hear their stories

2104
02:04:18.48 --> 02:04:20.000
and what they went through.

2105
02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:24.52
And they came back and put injected their lessons learned

2106
02:04:24.52 --> 02:04:26.04
into the Sierra Schools.

2107
02:04:26.04 --> 02:04:29.40
And so that was awesome to get those lessons learned

2108
02:04:29.40 --> 02:04:32.20
and just different breaking points, you know,

2109
02:04:32.20 --> 02:04:33.76
how long someone can take it

2110
02:04:33.76 --> 02:04:37.08
and, you know, everyone's gonna eventually break,

2111
02:04:37.08 --> 02:04:40.68
but, you know, how much, you know, how long are you gonna go?

2112
02:04:40.68 --> 02:04:42.88
And even when they break, they give bad information

2113
02:04:42.88 --> 02:04:46.12
or useless information and pretty heroic stuff there.

2114
02:04:46.12 --> 02:04:47.80
Did you say you went on a deployment

2115
02:04:47.80 --> 02:04:49.40
while you were at Sierra School?

2116
02:04:49.40 --> 02:04:52.72
Yeah, so originally I was gonna go out the door

2117
02:04:52.72 --> 02:04:57.12
with Seal Team two and do my re-enlistment there with them

2118
02:04:57.12 --> 02:05:00.36
and get it all happy and tax-free.

2119
02:05:00.36 --> 02:05:05.36
And that got denied because I needed there at the school.

2120
02:05:06.32 --> 02:05:08.36
You know, there's only a couple of seals there.

2121
02:05:08.36 --> 02:05:10.76
And really, you know, there's some Marines there too,

2122
02:05:10.76 --> 02:05:13.28
but then the rest are all air crew and pilots.

2123
02:05:13.28 --> 02:05:15.60
That's not what they do for a living.

2124
02:05:15.60 --> 02:05:18.32
So, and then later on, you know,

2125
02:05:18.32 --> 02:05:20.28
it kind of made a little better, better stink about it,

2126
02:05:20.28 --> 02:05:22.56
a little better sales pitch to go.

2127
02:05:22.56 --> 02:05:25.28
And I was gonna go on deployment with Seal Team eight

2128
02:05:25.28 --> 02:05:28.92
to Iraq and it was all worked out.

2129
02:05:28.92 --> 02:05:30.48
I was even gonna stay there longer.

2130
02:05:30.48 --> 02:05:33.12
I was gonna really do some things,

2131
02:05:33.12 --> 02:05:36.16
Seal related there, you know, maybe not,

2132
02:05:36.16 --> 02:05:38.20
but I was gonna be in task unit and I was bringing up

2133
02:05:38.20 --> 02:05:39.36
my snack.

2134
02:05:39.36 --> 02:05:41.24
Well, I mean, we were capturing a lot of guys

2135
02:05:41.24 --> 02:05:43.40
throughout the war and having, you know,

2136
02:05:43.40 --> 02:05:47.64
at a point we kind of transferred to having our own,

2137
02:05:47.64 --> 02:05:49.88
well, not our own seals, but other seals,

2138
02:05:49.88 --> 02:05:51.92
due interrogations and due intel gathering.

2139
02:05:51.92 --> 02:05:53.36
They were freaking great, man.

2140
02:05:53.36 --> 02:05:54.76
They were awesome.

2141
02:05:54.76 --> 02:05:56.64
So it was really good to have guys

2142
02:05:56.64 --> 02:05:58.56
that were able to do that kind of stuff.

2143
02:05:58.56 --> 02:06:02.12
Yeah, and it's, and I probably wouldn't have been doing that,

2144
02:06:02.12 --> 02:06:04.08
but actually working in, you know,

2145
02:06:05.64 --> 02:06:08.80
the pitch from our side of recovery,

2146
02:06:08.80 --> 02:06:11.64
but really I was just gonna be working with a task unit

2147
02:06:11.64 --> 02:06:14.64
and I was gonna be an extra gun and work whatever,

2148
02:06:14.64 --> 02:06:18.88
you know, worked it out with the Command-Mash Chief.

2149
02:06:18.88 --> 02:06:20.04
Have gun, we'll travel.

2150
02:06:20.04 --> 02:06:23.20
Yep, and all worked out, ready to go.

2151
02:06:23.20 --> 02:06:27.92
So I get, I'm on my way down to Virginia Beach

2152
02:06:27.92 --> 02:06:30.76
and the civilian ops guy says,

2153
02:06:30.76 --> 02:06:33.92
hey, we have this requirement in Columbia, you know,

2154
02:06:33.92 --> 02:06:36.52
the agency guys got wrapped up down there

2155
02:06:36.52 --> 02:06:38.16
and they're trying to get them out

2156
02:06:39.20 --> 02:06:40.72
and we need a Spanish speaker.

2157
02:06:41.76 --> 02:06:45.36
Okay, so I was on my way down there

2158
02:06:45.36 --> 02:06:52.36
and they got released, but I was already on my way down,

2159
02:06:55.40 --> 02:06:58.16
so I went to go work with the front Teresa

2160
02:06:58.16 --> 02:07:00.88
and was attached to Debt South

2161
02:07:00.88 --> 02:07:03.28
and stayed down there for four months

2162
02:07:03.28 --> 02:07:05.20
and that was pretty wild

2163
02:07:05.20 --> 02:07:08.72
because I hadn't been to Panama since it closed

2164
02:07:10.16 --> 02:07:14.40
and went into the Darien, you know,

2165
02:07:14.40 --> 02:07:16.60
just checking some things out

2166
02:07:16.60 --> 02:07:21.60
and you see an entire boat load of gateway computers

2167
02:07:22.32 --> 02:07:25.08
going, making its way into the Darien.

2168
02:07:25.08 --> 02:07:26.56
You can't miss those boxes, you know,

2169
02:07:26.56 --> 02:07:28.76
the white and black boxes.

2170
02:07:30.32 --> 02:07:32.12
And then you see a whole, you know,

2171
02:07:32.12 --> 02:07:34.12
Cayuca, you know, dug out Canoe Load,

2172
02:07:34.12 --> 02:07:39.04
come of empty El Panama, you know, beer coming back out.

2173
02:07:41.20 --> 02:07:43.08
A lot goes on in the Darien Gap, you know,

2174
02:07:43.08 --> 02:07:44.80
where it's really a national forest,

2175
02:07:44.80 --> 02:07:46.80
you can't go in there.

2176
02:07:46.80 --> 02:07:48.28
There's no vehicle traffic in there

2177
02:07:48.28 --> 02:07:50.40
unless you, you know, narco-terrorist.

2178
02:07:51.76 --> 02:07:53.88
And so, yeah, there's definitely a ton that goes down there,

2179
02:07:53.88 --> 02:07:56.48
a whole bunch of, I'll leave it at different things

2180
02:07:56.48 --> 02:07:57.84
to get funneled through

2181
02:07:57.84 --> 02:08:01.24
and it was really neat to see and be part of that

2182
02:08:01.24 --> 02:08:03.84
and try and get the front Teresa online

2183
02:08:03.84 --> 02:08:05.92
to, you know, help us out

2184
02:08:05.92 --> 02:08:07.72
and keep things from coming north.

2185
02:08:08.76 --> 02:08:11.72
And that ends up being your last deployment in the teams?

2186
02:08:11.72 --> 02:08:15.44
Yeah, and then back up to, you know,

2187
02:08:15.44 --> 02:08:18.88
back up to finish my time out at Sears School.

2188
02:08:18.88 --> 02:08:21.16
Tunne Learn though, watching the different interaction

2189
02:08:21.16 --> 02:08:25.04
with, you know, the Chinese that were down there,

2190
02:08:25.04 --> 02:08:29.84
you know, getting their fingers into everything, you know.

2191
02:08:29.84 --> 02:08:32.52
Yeah, you know, yeah, I'll leave it at that.

2192
02:08:32.52 --> 02:08:35.76
There's definitely some work that needs to be done there.

2193
02:08:38.36 --> 02:08:40.20
You see, then it next up is retirement.

2194
02:08:40.20 --> 02:08:42.12
And what are you planning to do when you retire?

2195
02:08:42.12 --> 02:08:44.08
So this is now 2009 you're gonna retire?

2196
02:08:44.08 --> 02:08:44.92
Or you retire?

2197
02:08:44.92 --> 02:08:49.64
Yeah, new year's year 2009.

2198
02:08:49.64 --> 02:08:52.16
Start the new year unemployed was a plan.

2199
02:08:52.16 --> 02:08:54.48
Gotta go Whittlewood in Maine.

2200
02:08:54.48 --> 02:08:57.000
And I had, you know, nest egg settled up.

2201
02:08:57.000 --> 02:08:58.28
I didn't need to work for a few years

2202
02:08:58.28 --> 02:09:00.16
if I didn't need one too, you know.

2203
02:09:00.16 --> 02:09:01.92
And that never happened.

2204
02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:05.32
You know, the call started coming

2205
02:09:05.32 --> 02:09:08.84
and I started doing some training back with the teams.

2206
02:09:08.84 --> 02:09:10.000
Just contracting?

2207
02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:14.48
Yeah, we're gonna sit X's, work some different training pieces,

2208
02:09:14.48 --> 02:09:18.28
ended up doing some research, test development stuff.

2209
02:09:18.28 --> 02:09:21.68
And then, then I'm going to Yemen,

2210
02:09:23.48 --> 02:09:26.88
not with the teams, the contractor there,

2211
02:09:26.88 --> 02:09:29.76
and, you know, administrative, the security guy.

2212
02:09:30.68 --> 02:09:34.68
And that was pretty wild, cause that's the, you know,

2213
02:09:34.68 --> 02:09:37.84
AQAP, you know, al-Qaeda and the Arabian Peninsula,

2214
02:09:37.84 --> 02:09:40.28
the hot, hot spot, we were right in the hot spot

2215
02:09:40.28 --> 02:09:41.60
of the hot spot.

2216
02:09:41.60 --> 02:09:44.48
So really learning how to use my words

2217
02:09:44.48 --> 02:09:46.04
cause we didn't have a gun.

2218
02:09:46.04 --> 02:09:49.54
And you've got, you got to run around blowing up our wells.

2219
02:09:50.64 --> 02:09:55.44
And it's, the stories are pretty weird

2220
02:09:55.44 --> 02:09:57.44
because they're that dumb.

2221
02:09:57.44 --> 02:10:00.64
Everybody's gotta understand they're all stoned.

2222
02:10:00.64 --> 02:10:03.84
Everybody in Yemen choose cotton, you know,

2223
02:10:03.84 --> 02:10:07.000
which is a hallucinogenic and phenamine.

2224
02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:09.76
And they're all, you know, in the city,

2225
02:10:09.76 --> 02:10:12.12
they start chewing it, you know, about four o'clock

2226
02:10:12.12 --> 02:10:14.000
in the desert, they chew it earlier.

2227
02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:16.80
In the desert, it's got a whole bunch of

2228
02:10:19.24 --> 02:10:20.64
different fertilizers in it.

2229
02:10:20.64 --> 02:10:24.20
And it's, it's, it winds them up a little bit more.

2230
02:10:24.20 --> 02:10:27.28
And so you try, you know, we don't want to get a,

2231
02:10:28.48 --> 02:10:30.84
doing everything at the same time, all the time.

2232
02:10:30.84 --> 02:10:32.64
You leave in the gate, you know,

2233
02:10:32.64 --> 02:10:34.24
but you try and get things done in the morning

2234
02:10:34.24 --> 02:10:36.32
cause they're wound up in the afternoon.

2235
02:10:36.32 --> 02:10:37.80
And so that's different.

2236
02:10:37.80 --> 02:10:40.96
And we've got three different facilities we're checking out,

2237
02:10:40.96 --> 02:10:43.40
trying to keep the oil flow into the job.

2238
02:10:43.40 --> 02:10:46.76
Your inner security is the tribe

2239
02:10:47.60 --> 02:10:50.28
and the outer security and all the outposts

2240
02:10:50.28 --> 02:10:54.12
are the Yemeni army and they hate each other.

2241
02:10:54.12 --> 02:10:57.000
The Yemeni army has a drinking problem.

2242
02:10:57.000 --> 02:10:59.12
They make their own hooch along with a cot.

2243
02:11:00.40 --> 02:11:05.40
And the State Department contract for pilots,

2244
02:11:05.40 --> 02:11:09.88
pilot training, you will not chew cotton while flying.

2245
02:11:10.96 --> 02:11:12.76
So that kind of sets the quesa of it.

2246
02:11:12.76 --> 02:11:16.28
That actually has to be written in a contract of,

2247
02:11:16.28 --> 02:11:20.76
and literally we had millions of dollars

2248
02:11:20.76 --> 02:11:22.84
of oil production slowed or stopped

2249
02:11:22.84 --> 02:11:26.60
because they didn't get their tea and crackers.

2250
02:11:26.60 --> 02:11:28.68
And literally, cause the driver guards

2251
02:11:28.68 --> 02:11:30.36
want their tea and crackers.

2252
02:11:30.36 --> 02:11:34.16
Well, their cousin hijacked the truck

2253
02:11:34.16 --> 02:11:35.92
that has the tea and crackers in it

2254
02:11:35.92 --> 02:11:38.80
and took it back to the town, Bahan.

2255
02:11:38.80 --> 02:11:42.84
And we'll tell your cousin to let it go.

2256
02:11:42.84 --> 02:11:47.84
And eventually just let him and Ha on it for a while

2257
02:11:48.60 --> 02:11:52.64
cause the sharing agreement gets pushed to the right

2258
02:11:52.64 --> 02:11:56.12
and they're not really losing money, it's just delaying it.

2259
02:11:56.12 --> 02:11:57.76
And so you eventually resolve it.

2260
02:11:57.76 --> 02:11:59.92
Hey, we'll go ahead and give you money

2261
02:11:59.92 --> 02:12:01.68
to buy your own tea and crackers

2262
02:12:01.68 --> 02:12:04.24
and we'll get, you know, things going again.

2263
02:12:04.24 --> 02:12:05.92
Eventually they say okay.

2264
02:12:05.92 --> 02:12:08.56
And then eventually they come around to say yep,

2265
02:12:08.56 --> 02:12:09.76
we're happy getting the raise

2266
02:12:09.76 --> 02:12:11.80
and now we want our tea and crackers again.

2267
02:12:11.80 --> 02:12:15.88
It's, but you get run down in the desert by a guy

2268
02:12:15.88 --> 02:12:18.48
who just got, his brother got drawn to the desert

2269
02:12:18.48 --> 02:12:20.44
cause he's running around with Al Qaeda.

2270
02:12:20.44 --> 02:12:24.44
And his brother wants payback or his dad

2271
02:12:24.44 --> 02:12:28.36
through his brother wants payback for his son.

2272
02:12:28.36 --> 02:12:32.84
He wants his back pay cause he used to work for the army

2273
02:12:34.44 --> 02:12:36.64
but he now he worked for Al Qaeda when he got,

2274
02:12:36.64 --> 02:12:38.24
you know, got the drone strike.

2275
02:12:39.36 --> 02:12:43.28
And he wants back pay and medical benefits from the company

2276
02:12:43.28 --> 02:12:46.84
cause he used to work for the company also

2277
02:12:46.84 --> 02:12:51.72
but he was blowing up the pipeline and the wells, you know,

2278
02:12:51.72 --> 02:12:55.16
one day he got it below the restrictor, the cutoff.

2279
02:12:55.16 --> 02:12:57.20
And so it wouldn't stop.

2280
02:12:57.20 --> 02:13:01.52
You know, normally it'll just cut itself off the fire.

2281
02:13:01.52 --> 02:13:03.36
So you got to bring wild oil in it like four

2282
02:13:03.36 --> 02:13:05.16
or five million a day.

2283
02:13:05.16 --> 02:13:06.12
Day.

2284
02:13:06.12 --> 02:13:06.96
Yeah.

2285
02:13:07.88 --> 02:13:09.36
There's a bill.

2286
02:13:09.36 --> 02:13:12.84
And this guy runs you down in the desert.

2287
02:13:12.84 --> 02:13:15.72
I know there were a couple of shots over your head

2288
02:13:15.72 --> 02:13:18.48
to just kind of chest bump, you know,

2289
02:13:19.44 --> 02:13:21.56
not really intended to shoot at you

2290
02:13:21.56 --> 02:13:23.92
but shoot at you pretty close.

2291
02:13:23.92 --> 02:13:27.48
And they outnumber us and they've got better firepower.

2292
02:13:27.48 --> 02:13:31.44
So you stop and you talk it out, you know.

2293
02:13:31.44 --> 02:13:33.92
And, you know, hey, we'll work on this.

2294
02:13:33.92 --> 02:13:36.08
And, you know, I make the fake glass in the air

2295
02:13:36.08 --> 02:13:38.88
and they look like I'm looking for the drone.

2296
02:13:38.88 --> 02:13:43.88
And my security guy is like their cousin, you know,

2297
02:13:44.88 --> 02:13:47.60
but he's sworn to take care of me and it's legit.

2298
02:13:48.72 --> 02:13:50.56
And there's two guys with belt fed, you know,

2299
02:13:50.56 --> 02:13:55.56
RPKs and yeah, it's you learn to use your words.

2300
02:13:58.36 --> 02:13:59.80
It's serious school help with that.

2301
02:13:59.80 --> 02:14:02.04
And I'm doing it through an interpreter too.

2302
02:14:02.04 --> 02:14:07.04
You know, Helo pilot has a stroke that works

2303
02:14:07.36 --> 02:14:11.20
for the oil company because they're spiraling up

2304
02:14:11.20 --> 02:14:15.08
to 11,000 feet to get out of the range of the fire.

2305
02:14:15.08 --> 02:14:17.20
Cause I'm there during the Arab spring.

2306
02:14:17.20 --> 02:14:22.20
And the guy has a stroke that later that day

2307
02:14:23.08 --> 02:14:25.20
in the chow hall and they come find in me, you know,

2308
02:14:25.20 --> 02:14:29.76
hey, Mr. Ed, you know, he just had a stroke.

2309
02:14:29.76 --> 02:14:32.40
All right, let's load them up and, you know,

2310
02:14:32.40 --> 02:14:33.40
get one of our vehicles.

2311
02:14:33.40 --> 02:14:34.24
He didn't work for us.

2312
02:14:34.24 --> 02:14:37.68
He works for a separate company that's not taken care of him.

2313
02:14:37.68 --> 02:14:40.12
Like, I mean, those people are taking care of me

2314
02:14:40.12 --> 02:14:41.84
and we're taking care of everybody.

2315
02:14:41.84 --> 02:14:46.60
And so load them up, take them to the hospital.

2316
02:14:46.60 --> 02:14:50.48
I didn't go, you know, just provided what he needed.

2317
02:14:50.48 --> 02:14:53.48
And then next day, Mr. Ed,

2318
02:14:53.48 --> 02:14:55.16
they're not letting us into the hospital.

2319
02:14:55.16 --> 02:14:57.64
You know, it's free, this free medical care,

2320
02:14:57.64 --> 02:15:00.40
but you got to bring your sheets and your food every day

2321
02:15:00.40 --> 02:15:02.56
and go out in town and get the medicine

2322
02:15:02.56 --> 02:15:05.32
that they're prescribing for you and bring it back.

2323
02:15:05.32 --> 02:15:10.32
Well, that day, President Sala got blown up, you know,

2324
02:15:10.32 --> 02:15:14.68
and one of the shakes that got blown up in that mosque

2325
02:15:14.68 --> 02:15:16.16
was in that same hospital.

2326
02:15:16.16 --> 02:15:18.88
So that tribe took over the hospital

2327
02:15:18.88 --> 02:15:21.16
and they've got it sandbagged in.

2328
02:15:21.16 --> 02:15:23.20
They've got, you know, literally,

2329
02:15:24.28 --> 02:15:28.000
RPGs walking through the hallways, you know,

2330
02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:30.08
good times, good times.

2331
02:15:30.08 --> 02:15:33.16
And, you know, I'm this 200 and,

2332
02:15:34.60 --> 02:15:37.32
probably 65 pound white guy, you know,

2333
02:15:37.32 --> 02:15:39.32
blonde hair guy at this time, you know,

2334
02:15:39.32 --> 02:15:43.60
and then, yeah, get me this interpreter.

2335
02:15:44.88 --> 02:15:47.000
And we're going to the hospital.

2336
02:15:47.000 --> 02:15:49.08
I said, hey, here's what you're gonna say.

2337
02:15:49.08 --> 02:15:50.68
You're gonna say how I say it.

2338
02:15:51.84 --> 02:15:54.56
You got to tell them that you're very happy

2339
02:15:54.56 --> 02:15:55.44
that they're there.

2340
02:15:55.44 --> 02:15:59.56
You're very sorry about their shake, you know,

2341
02:15:59.56 --> 02:16:03.56
getting blown up and we've got a guy in there too.

2342
02:16:03.56 --> 02:16:05.12
You guys are taking care of your guy.

2343
02:16:05.12 --> 02:16:06.88
We want to take care of our guy.

2344
02:16:06.88 --> 02:16:09.56
Please continue to make the hospital secure,

2345
02:16:09.56 --> 02:16:10.76
but we'd like to go in there

2346
02:16:10.76 --> 02:16:12.32
so we could take care of our guy also.

2347
02:16:12.32 --> 02:16:14.28
Could you please let us in?

2348
02:16:14.28 --> 02:16:15.12
And it worked.

2349
02:16:15.12 --> 02:16:16.84
They were getting shut down, you know,

2350
02:16:16.84 --> 02:16:18.44
and would not be allowed in.

2351
02:16:18.44 --> 02:16:20.32
So we go in there and it's a trade.

2352
02:16:20.32 --> 02:16:22.80
They've got all these old overpressure blast folks

2353
02:16:22.80 --> 02:16:23.80
that are just smoked.

2354
02:16:23.80 --> 02:16:26.04
And then this guy's in there with, you know,

2355
02:16:26.04 --> 02:16:28.80
I had a stroke, you know, grown man diaper

2356
02:16:28.80 --> 02:16:30.84
and not getting taken care of.

2357
02:16:30.84 --> 02:16:32.68
And so we get them all set.

2358
02:16:32.68 --> 02:16:34.56
They run out in town to go get the medicine

2359
02:16:34.56 --> 02:16:38.12
and I stayed there with him and they come back

2360
02:16:38.12 --> 02:16:39.48
and they call me up and said,

2361
02:16:39.48 --> 02:16:41.60
they're not letting us in again.

2362
02:16:41.60 --> 02:16:42.72
What would you do?

2363
02:16:42.72 --> 02:16:44.48
Well, we just want in.

2364
02:16:44.48 --> 02:16:46.40
Start all over again.

2365
02:16:46.40 --> 02:16:47.88
You're happy to there.

2366
02:16:47.88 --> 02:16:49.40
They're making the hospital secure.

2367
02:16:49.40 --> 02:16:52.28
Not really happy, but you're telling them they're happy.

2368
02:16:52.28 --> 02:16:53.96
You got your guy, we got our guy.

2369
02:16:53.96 --> 02:16:55.08
We want to take care of our guy

2370
02:16:55.08 --> 02:16:56.80
like you're taking care of your guy.

2371
02:16:56.80 --> 02:16:59.52
And up, you know, then they come back in

2372
02:16:59.52 --> 02:17:04.16
and it's, yeah, the ability to find something.

2373
02:17:04.16 --> 02:17:06.96
The common piece, your guys hurt and our guys hurt.

2374
02:17:06.96 --> 02:17:08.36
We're happier here.

2375
02:17:08.36 --> 02:17:11.28
You know, you're going through a checkpoint, you know.

2376
02:17:11.28 --> 02:17:12.60
Man, I'm happy you guys here.

2377
02:17:12.60 --> 02:17:13.96
Have you guys seen anything?

2378
02:17:13.96 --> 02:17:15.20
Is everything good?

2379
02:17:15.20 --> 02:17:17.32
You know, is anything we need to be aware of?

2380
02:17:17.32 --> 02:17:18.84
You know, because, you know,

2381
02:17:20.28 --> 02:17:23.64
you're not happy to there, but you got to explain that.

2382
02:17:23.64 --> 02:17:27.56
You know, get that, find something that's in common

2383
02:17:27.56 --> 02:17:28.40
that may or may not be.

2384
02:17:28.40 --> 02:17:30.20
Yeah, build a little quick relationship.

2385
02:17:30.20 --> 02:17:31.40
Yeah, a little rapport.

2386
02:17:31.40 --> 02:17:32.72
Yeah.

2387
02:17:32.72 --> 02:17:34.28
So, ton of that.

2388
02:17:34.28 --> 02:17:35.12
Yeah.

2389
02:17:35.12 --> 02:17:37.60
So how long did you do that contracting stuff for?

2390
02:17:39.84 --> 02:17:42.44
It's just kind of continual since I retired.

2391
02:17:42.44 --> 02:17:44.08
You know, it really started working

2392
02:17:44.08 --> 02:17:46.32
to get for Brian, Sergeant, you know.

2393
02:17:46.32 --> 02:17:49.44
And he'd get me set up on all kinds of, you know,

2394
02:17:49.44 --> 02:17:51.16
name of companies, but it was fantastic.

2395
02:17:51.16 --> 02:17:53.000
You know, everything from going to the Olympics

2396
02:17:53.000 --> 02:17:56.08
to the World Cup, living out town with the athletes.

2397
02:17:56.08 --> 02:17:59.84
And, you know, as team guys, you're just not a monkey.

2398
02:17:59.84 --> 02:18:02.12
You're setting everything up,

2399
02:18:02.12 --> 02:18:03.56
squaring everything away,

2400
02:18:03.56 --> 02:18:06.36
way beyond what security guy does.

2401
02:18:06.36 --> 02:18:08.72
And making sure everything flows smoothly,

2402
02:18:08.72 --> 02:18:11.64
picking up, you know, gaps without dropping security.

2403
02:18:11.64 --> 02:18:16.16
And security is a civilian, especially executive stuff,

2404
02:18:16.16 --> 02:18:20.12
is you really have to have a really,

2405
02:18:21.68 --> 02:18:24.56
you know, easy but hard mentality at the same time.

2406
02:18:24.56 --> 02:18:25.64
I'm trying to look like somebody

2407
02:18:25.64 --> 02:18:27.36
that you don't want to bother,

2408
02:18:27.36 --> 02:18:28.76
and you're going to go, you know,

2409
02:18:28.76 --> 02:18:32.20
bother the other watch company, you know,

2410
02:18:32.20 --> 02:18:34.24
because that one's not worth hitting.

2411
02:18:34.24 --> 02:18:36.12
And at the same time, you know,

2412
02:18:36.12 --> 02:18:37.68
they might want you sitting at the table with them

2413
02:18:37.68 --> 02:18:40.56
when you'd rather not, because that's not your job.

2414
02:18:40.56 --> 02:18:42.08
But it is to them.

2415
02:18:42.08 --> 02:18:44.84
So you gotta make a bunch of assessments.

2416
02:18:44.84 --> 02:18:49.36
And, you know, yeah, do some stuff you wouldn't normally do,

2417
02:18:49.36 --> 02:18:50.68
but you do the assessment.

2418
02:18:50.68 --> 02:18:55.68
And, you know, it's really interesting, super, super flexible.

2419
02:18:55.68 --> 02:18:59.20
And you have to be super personable,

2420
02:18:59.20 --> 02:19:03.20
be able to talk with, you know, heads of state

2421
02:19:03.20 --> 02:19:07.20
that these, you know, top, I mean,

2422
02:19:07.20 --> 02:19:12.20
I've been to F1 races in the absolute most,

2423
02:19:13.000 --> 02:19:15.96
without naming the company, as good as it gets.

2424
02:19:15.96 --> 02:19:17.72
And you're talking to some wild people.

2425
02:19:17.72 --> 02:19:20.000
And, you know, they want to talk to you,

2426
02:19:20.000 --> 02:19:22.48
because you're the seal, you know,

2427
02:19:22.48 --> 02:19:24.88
and they're proud to have you with them,

2428
02:19:24.88 --> 02:19:26.96
and they're showing you off.

2429
02:19:26.96 --> 02:19:28.56
I got a job to do still.

2430
02:19:28.56 --> 02:19:32.56
But it's a wild mix.

2431
02:19:32.96 --> 02:19:35.80
And if you are the grumpy guy,

2432
02:19:35.80 --> 02:19:38.24
because I was with, you know, a rock band,

2433
02:19:38.24 --> 02:19:42.08
and who's really good people, super, you know,

2434
02:19:44.48 --> 02:19:46.48
yeah, just, that was super enjoyable.

2435
02:19:46.48 --> 02:19:49.92
But we got some, we're always augmented overseas

2436
02:19:49.92 --> 02:19:51.12
by somebody else.

2437
02:19:51.12 --> 02:19:56.12
And the folks that are augmenting us,

2438
02:19:57.64 --> 02:20:01.04
they just have this militant look about them,

2439
02:20:01.04 --> 02:20:03.28
you know, including having sleeves rolled up,

2440
02:20:03.28 --> 02:20:07.56
and like, you know, even, you know,

2441
02:20:07.56 --> 02:20:10.04
cargo panties, you know, pants and stuff.

2442
02:20:10.04 --> 02:20:12.68
And that's not the look we want, folks.

2443
02:20:12.68 --> 02:20:14.76
And a lot of ways to do overseas, you know,

2444
02:20:14.76 --> 02:20:17.84
I'm making sure the law enforcement that's there

2445
02:20:17.84 --> 02:20:22.84
is that they, and I don't know them very well,

2446
02:20:24.92 --> 02:20:26.76
so it's, you know, because we're jumping

2447
02:20:26.76 --> 02:20:28.48
into a lot of things, but I'm making sure

2448
02:20:28.48 --> 02:20:31.80
they feel right, you know, that they're not

2449
02:20:31.80 --> 02:20:33.40
nervous themselves.

2450
02:20:33.40 --> 02:20:35.28
You know, if you're there a long time,

2451
02:20:35.28 --> 02:20:38.92
I'm making sure the driver is the same feel today

2452
02:20:38.92 --> 02:20:41.52
as he had yesterday and the day before, you know,

2453
02:20:41.52 --> 02:20:44.000
so that, you know, he wasn't threatened

2454
02:20:44.000 --> 02:20:46.28
and told to make a left-hand turn, you know,

2455
02:20:46.28 --> 02:20:48.64
when he's supposed to be going straight.

2456
02:20:48.64 --> 02:20:49.60
It's a ton of that.

2457
02:20:49.60 --> 02:20:52.20
I've talked to the clients a lot, you know,

2458
02:20:52.20 --> 02:20:56.76
they need to build rapport and be kind

2459
02:20:56.76 --> 02:20:59.92
to their security personnel and their drivers and things

2460
02:20:59.92 --> 02:21:03.08
so that, you know, they love them, you know,

2461
02:21:03.08 --> 02:21:06.08
their family, because you're asking them to take,

2462
02:21:06.08 --> 02:21:08.96
you know, when I'm, it's, the deal is,

2463
02:21:08.96 --> 02:21:10.76
I'm gonna stick my neck out for these people

2464
02:21:10.76 --> 02:21:13.64
and this father's gonna risk his life for these folks,

2465
02:21:13.64 --> 02:21:15.28
and so are those folks.

2466
02:21:15.28 --> 02:21:19.32
So you better treat them kind and like family, you know,

2467
02:21:19.32 --> 02:21:22.04
and I know a lot of these folks, they use us as a,

2468
02:21:22.04 --> 02:21:25.24
you know, a bit of a prop, you know,

2469
02:21:25.24 --> 02:21:28.96
hey, let's get going, you know, or interject here and there,

2470
02:21:28.96 --> 02:21:32.000
and it's, it's, there's some, you know,

2471
02:21:32.000 --> 02:21:33.80
some of these guys are skilled sales folks

2472
02:21:33.80 --> 02:21:36.84
and they're doing some act and, you know, you take it on it.

2473
02:21:36.84 --> 02:21:40.20
Yeah, but he knows that I know also, you know,

2474
02:21:40.20 --> 02:21:43.24
so okay, it's, again, it's a wild ride

2475
02:21:43.24 --> 02:21:46.20
if you're not flexible and you don't have a mentality

2476
02:21:46.20 --> 02:21:48.92
that can roll with it a little bit,

2477
02:21:48.92 --> 02:21:50.60
yeah, you're not gonna be very successful at it.

2478
02:21:50.60 --> 02:21:53.52
And I've had some wild clients, I really enjoyed that part.

2479
02:21:53.52 --> 02:21:57.56
I like taking care of folks and I'm, yeah, admittedly,

2480
02:21:57.56 --> 02:21:59.84
I'm saying I'm pretty damn good at it

2481
02:21:59.84 --> 02:22:02.04
because they keep calling me back, you know,

2482
02:22:02.04 --> 02:22:04.72
and you know, and Brian's keeps feeding stuff

2483
02:22:04.72 --> 02:22:06.28
and I haven't done it in a while.

2484
02:22:06.28 --> 02:22:08.12
I started doing a lot of already, you know,

2485
02:22:08.12 --> 02:22:11.36
RDT and research, testing development with teams

2486
02:22:11.36 --> 02:22:12.44
and some other fun things.

2487
02:22:12.44 --> 02:22:16.000
So yeah, you know, became a firefighter, you know,

2488
02:22:16.000 --> 02:22:17.76
a volunteer firefighter and all,

2489
02:22:17.76 --> 02:22:20.64
or was rather an Alma until we moved from there.

2490
02:22:20.64 --> 02:22:25.36
Then I became a reserve deputy sheriff in Lincoln County.

2491
02:22:25.36 --> 02:22:28.88
And so you're doing some contracting,

2492
02:22:28.88 --> 02:22:30.12
you're doing some firefighting,

2493
02:22:30.12 --> 02:22:32.24
you're doing some reserve sheriff activity.

2494
02:22:32.24 --> 02:22:36.32
At what point do you get roped in

2495
02:22:36.32 --> 02:22:39.08
to the political arena?

2496
02:22:39.08 --> 02:22:41.04
Yeah, and I'm doing all that.

2497
02:22:41.04 --> 02:22:43.24
I bought an excavator, you know,

2498
02:22:43.24 --> 02:22:47.76
I'm grading driveways and digging foundations for folks,

2499
02:22:47.76 --> 02:22:49.92
I'm doing some diving for folks.

2500
02:22:49.92 --> 02:22:51.68
I mean, I've got all these things going on,

2501
02:22:51.68 --> 02:22:54.08
I'm getting my, I got my private pilot license,

2502
02:22:54.08 --> 02:22:57.16
I'm about to start getting my commercial license.

2503
02:22:57.16 --> 02:23:00.88
And yeah, it's, you know, 14-ish months ago,

2504
02:23:01.80 --> 02:23:04.08
people have been asking a lot for us to get involved,

2505
02:23:04.08 --> 02:23:06.32
for me to get involved in the politics

2506
02:23:06.32 --> 02:23:09.04
and because things are going sideways.

2507
02:23:09.04 --> 02:23:11.16
And I kept saying nope, nope, nope.

2508
02:23:11.16 --> 02:23:15.04
And things got to the head and they asked again,

2509
02:23:15.04 --> 02:23:18.36
again I said no and tell a story over and over,

2510
02:23:18.36 --> 02:23:19.88
and my wife said yes you will.

2511
02:23:21.000 --> 02:23:24.64
And her, she's from, and she was yes, yes, yes you will.

2512
02:23:24.64 --> 02:23:26.88
We talked about it, her being from Venezuela

2513
02:23:26.88 --> 02:23:31.12
and seeing that, you know, that leadership gap

2514
02:23:31.12 --> 02:23:33.76
in Venezuela, you know, caused it to spiral down.

2515
02:23:33.76 --> 02:23:36.12
People don't realize it was Venezuela.

2516
02:23:36.12 --> 02:23:38.12
We used to get 17% of our oil from Venezuela.

2517
02:23:38.12 --> 02:23:39.72
Oh yeah, more than any other country.

2518
02:23:39.72 --> 02:23:44.40
I mean, they were, they were a wealthy country.

2519
02:23:44.40 --> 02:23:47.56
And now they are, you know, again,

2520
02:23:47.56 --> 02:23:50.08
just like the hospital in Yemen,

2521
02:23:51.52 --> 02:23:53.36
you had to go out in town and get medicine

2522
02:23:53.36 --> 02:23:56.16
and provide your sheets and provide your food in hospital.

2523
02:23:56.16 --> 02:23:59.24
There's no medicine out in town now either.

2524
02:23:59.24 --> 02:24:00.36
You had to go to Columbia.

2525
02:24:00.36 --> 02:24:03.88
Her family's a big part of it's originally from Columbia.

2526
02:24:03.88 --> 02:24:06.60
Well, they escaped the Narco State and went to Venezuela

2527
02:24:06.60 --> 02:24:08.24
and now they're fleeing back to the Narco State.

2528
02:24:08.24 --> 02:24:10.08
They had to go to Columbia to get medicine

2529
02:24:10.08 --> 02:24:11.88
for her uncle who was in the hospital.

2530
02:24:12.84 --> 02:24:16.40
And yeah, hey, we've got kids, you know,

2531
02:24:16.40 --> 02:24:19.20
we've got two in college and one in high school.

2532
02:24:20.44 --> 02:24:21.36
And there where we're doing it.

2533
02:24:21.36 --> 02:24:23.24
We sat down as a family and we talked about it.

2534
02:24:23.24 --> 02:24:26.44
We had to make sure everybody was good to go with it.

2535
02:24:27.32 --> 02:24:30.72
And, you know, to varying degrees to, you know,

2536
02:24:31.88 --> 02:24:33.40
what does my 15 year old know about it?

2537
02:24:33.40 --> 02:24:36.20
You know, he gets a large degree, you know,

2538
02:24:36.20 --> 02:24:40.32
he was, since he was, you know, that tall, you know,

2539
02:24:42.04 --> 02:24:44.48
he was, dad, this is made in China in it.

2540
02:24:44.48 --> 02:24:47.04
That's not right, you know.

2541
02:24:47.04 --> 02:24:50.76
So he gets a lot of things and he gets this to a degree.

2542
02:24:50.76 --> 02:24:52.52
My older sons helped me write stuff, you know,

2543
02:24:52.52 --> 02:24:53.96
he helped me write that pledge, you know,

2544
02:24:53.96 --> 02:24:57.12
may take an ownership of the condition of our country

2545
02:24:57.12 --> 02:24:59.60
because I have not participated, you know, in this.

2546
02:24:59.60 --> 02:25:01.48
I've always served, but never this.

2547
02:25:01.48 --> 02:25:02.32
He helped me write that.

2548
02:25:02.32 --> 02:25:04.24
He helped me write my first speech.

2549
02:25:04.24 --> 02:25:05.84
No one could write for me.

2550
02:25:05.84 --> 02:25:07.000
It all comes from the heart.

2551
02:25:07.000 --> 02:25:09.72
I free flow just about everything

2552
02:25:10.64 --> 02:25:11.64
because it's from the heart.

2553
02:25:11.64 --> 02:25:12.48
It's legit.

2554
02:25:12.48 --> 02:25:15.72
You know, this is not what I would normally do, you know.

2555
02:25:17.04 --> 02:25:19.52
I say it over and over again too, you know,

2556
02:25:19.52 --> 02:25:21.28
I grade my church driveway, you know,

2557
02:25:21.28 --> 02:25:23.72
I show up there when nobody's there, you know,

2558
02:25:23.72 --> 02:25:25.20
and I grade it.

2559
02:25:25.20 --> 02:25:30.20
It's a steep dirt hill and make it all pretty again,

2560
02:25:30.20 --> 02:25:33.32
load my tractor up and I go away before anybody comes back.

2561
02:25:33.32 --> 02:25:35.48
And now I'm doing a selfie while I'm doing it.

2562
02:25:35.48 --> 02:25:37.64
That is not who I am.

2563
02:25:37.64 --> 02:25:38.64
It is now.

2564
02:25:40.08 --> 02:25:42.12
Was there a straw that broke the camel's back

2565
02:25:42.12 --> 02:25:45.12
as far as making you say, yeah, I'll do it?

2566
02:25:45.12 --> 02:25:48.000
Or was the straw just your wife said, you better do this?

2567
02:25:48.000 --> 02:25:50.88
It's all the crazy divisiveness, you know.

2568
02:25:50.88 --> 02:25:54.08
In Sears school, you know, we actually taught

2569
02:25:55.08 --> 02:25:57.56
how not to get indoctrinated and not,

2570
02:25:57.56 --> 02:26:00.24
how not to allow these divisions happen

2571
02:26:00.24 --> 02:26:01.60
while you're a captive.

2572
02:26:01.60 --> 02:26:05.08
You know, in the Korean War, there were 14 Americans

2573
02:26:05.08 --> 02:26:08.88
that were taught in captivity that America's bad

2574
02:26:08.88 --> 02:26:12.20
and they did not, these captors convinced them

2575
02:26:12.20 --> 02:26:13.88
to stay in North Korea.

2576
02:26:13.88 --> 02:26:15.44
That's insane.

2577
02:26:15.44 --> 02:26:16.72
That's happening here in America.

2578
02:26:16.72 --> 02:26:18.96
How many ways are they trying to divide people?

2579
02:26:18.96 --> 02:26:20.80
Whether you're vaccinated and unvaccinated,

2580
02:26:20.80 --> 02:26:23.16
you're taught you're bad and evil if you're not vaccinated.

2581
02:26:23.16 --> 02:26:26.44
And you're taught, you know,

2582
02:26:26.44 --> 02:26:30.08
you deny the election or you think we need an election

2583
02:26:30.08 --> 02:26:33.08
integrity to take a look at the election, you know,

2584
02:26:33.08 --> 02:26:36.16
then you're a traitor to the country.

2585
02:26:36.16 --> 02:26:37.48
Hey, let's just take a look at it.

2586
02:26:37.48 --> 02:26:41.52
Make sure the people that think it was stolen understand it.

2587
02:26:41.52 --> 02:26:44.44
You know, I'll take that's an okay stance to have.

2588
02:26:44.44 --> 02:26:47.48
All this division in the country is insane.

2589
02:26:47.48 --> 02:26:48.72
It's not comfortable.

2590
02:26:49.52 --> 02:26:51.84
You know, I've complained about it

2591
02:26:51.84 --> 02:26:56.08
and it's the only thing I can do to make it right.

2592
02:26:56.08 --> 02:26:58.68
So we're stepping up and we're definitely stepping up

2593
02:26:58.68 --> 02:26:59.52
as a family.

2594
02:26:59.52 --> 02:27:02.32
My wife is a huge part of the campaign.

2595
02:27:02.32 --> 02:27:06.36
I mean, driving force and couldn't do it.

2596
02:27:06.36 --> 02:27:09.48
You know, wouldn't want to do it without family buy-in.

2597
02:27:09.48 --> 02:27:13.24
But yeah, it's a legit push, you know,

2598
02:27:13.24 --> 02:27:15.12
I was gonna go get my commercial pilot's license.

2599
02:27:15.12 --> 02:27:17.60
I was gonna do one more thing that was gonna be fun.

2600
02:27:17.60 --> 02:27:19.04
I had Joy flying.

2601
02:27:19.04 --> 02:27:20.72
That's on hold for a little bit.

2602
02:27:20.72 --> 02:27:22.08
What's been the biggest surprise

2603
02:27:22.08 --> 02:27:24.72
about entering the political arena?

2604
02:27:25.60 --> 02:27:28.84
Confirming all that divisiveness, you know,

2605
02:27:28.84 --> 02:27:31.12
because I walk up and I will talk to anybody.

2606
02:27:31.12 --> 02:27:36.12
I go to these fairs, all the farm fairs and all that,

2607
02:27:37.64 --> 02:27:42.000
agricultural fairs and I walk, I give my spiel.

2608
02:27:42.000 --> 02:27:45.04
You know, I always start with a retired Navy SEAL

2609
02:27:45.04 --> 02:27:46.56
because no one wants to talk to a politician

2610
02:27:46.56 --> 02:27:48.80
and I am definitely not that.

2611
02:27:48.80 --> 02:27:51.04
So I said, I'm at the Atlanta Retired Navy SEAL

2612
02:27:51.04 --> 02:27:52.96
running for U.S. Congress.

2613
02:27:52.96 --> 02:27:54.72
You have time for me to tell you about the campaign?

2614
02:27:54.72 --> 02:27:56.44
Great, I did 21 years in the Navy,

2615
02:27:56.44 --> 02:27:58.56
all of the SEAL teams, I'm a volunteer firefighter,

2616
02:27:58.56 --> 02:28:00.000
I'm a reserve deputy sheriff.

2617
02:28:00.000 --> 02:28:02.64
I never wanted to run for office, I'm running

2618
02:28:02.64 --> 02:28:04.28
because I was asked to.

2619
02:28:04.28 --> 02:28:08.12
And the guy goes, oh, hey, that sounds great.

2620
02:28:09.12 --> 02:28:10.88
Who's the president of the United States?

2621
02:28:10.88 --> 02:28:14.08
You know, I have to like it,

2622
02:28:14.08 --> 02:28:16.12
but Joe Biden's the president of the United States.

2623
02:28:16.12 --> 02:28:21.12
And he asked me, you know, was the election stolen again?

2624
02:28:21.44 --> 02:28:24.36
And I go, hey, we need to work on election integrity

2625
02:28:24.36 --> 02:28:27.28
so everybody's comfortable with the results of the election.

2626
02:28:27.28 --> 02:28:29.44
You know, whatever happened,

2627
02:28:29.44 --> 02:28:31.000
everybody denies that the election,

2628
02:28:31.000 --> 02:28:33.40
you know, Hillary Clinton, you know,

2629
02:28:33.40 --> 02:28:37.92
is still denying that her election was legitimate.

2630
02:28:37.92 --> 02:28:41.08
You know, the hanging chads and floor, all that stuff.

2631
02:28:41.08 --> 02:28:42.52
We gotta have something.

2632
02:28:42.52 --> 02:28:44.12
That man called me a traitor.

2633
02:28:45.24 --> 02:28:47.20
Volunteer firefighter, reserve deputy sheriff,

2634
02:28:47.20 --> 02:28:49.000
21 years in the SEAL teams.

2635
02:28:49.000 --> 02:28:51.80
I want to check the election integrity

2636
02:28:51.80 --> 02:28:54.84
so everybody's comfortable and I'm a traitor.

2637
02:28:54.84 --> 02:28:56.32
Not cool.

2638
02:28:56.32 --> 02:28:59.52
So a lot of that, you know,

2639
02:28:59.52 --> 02:29:01.88
building the campaigns pretty wild, you know,

2640
02:29:01.88 --> 02:29:05.08
we're definitely money visits main.

2641
02:29:05.08 --> 02:29:06.88
It doesn't stay there so we don't get, you know,

2642
02:29:06.88 --> 02:29:09.56
the donations don't flow in.

2643
02:29:09.56 --> 02:29:11.80
Although we're working our tail off.

2644
02:29:11.80 --> 02:29:13.28
We're out raising, you know,

2645
02:29:13.28 --> 02:29:16.60
somebody's been in DC for 14 years.

2646
02:29:17.52 --> 02:29:19.88
It had been in politics for 30 plus years

2647
02:29:19.88 --> 02:29:22.40
and we're out raising our three to one in human money.

2648
02:29:22.40 --> 02:29:25.28
But she gets 91% from PACs and, you know,

2649
02:29:25.28 --> 02:29:27.52
so she's got smoke in us and coin.

2650
02:29:28.80 --> 02:29:30.92
You know, and mostly out of state.

2651
02:29:32.12 --> 02:29:33.80
That's a wild thing, you know,

2652
02:29:33.80 --> 02:29:36.96
cause you can look at all that stuff in the FEC website.

2653
02:29:36.96 --> 02:29:38.28
That was a second quarter file.

2654
02:29:38.28 --> 02:29:42.16
That's gotta be like just so crazy to think

2655
02:29:42.16 --> 02:29:44.68
if you live in Maine, which obviously I got companies

2656
02:29:44.68 --> 02:29:47.72
up in Maine, you know, but, and I don't live there,

2657
02:29:47.72 --> 02:29:50.52
but if you live in Maine and you think that the people

2658
02:29:50.52 --> 02:29:54.24
that are trying to get someone elected don't live in Maine

2659
02:29:54.24 --> 02:29:55.76
and have no interest in Maine,

2660
02:29:55.76 --> 02:30:00.24
but they wanna wanna change what people are gonna vote for.

2661
02:30:00.24 --> 02:30:01.40
That's kinda crazy, right?

2662
02:30:01.40 --> 02:30:04.68
Yeah, and I don't know the right answer to fix that, you know?

2663
02:30:04.68 --> 02:30:06.96
And that was actually started by a Republican,

2664
02:30:06.96 --> 02:30:09.60
you know, the super PAC thing, which is, you know,

2665
02:30:09.60 --> 02:30:12.76
they can do unlimited expenditures in your name.

2666
02:30:12.76 --> 02:30:15.000
It's, no, definitely not right.

2667
02:30:16.20 --> 02:30:18.36
And I, you know, I'm definitely the weirdo.

2668
02:30:18.36 --> 02:30:23.04
I'm gonna probably go a lot, learning about who I am also.

2669
02:30:23.04 --> 02:30:25.60
Because I've never put full thought

2670
02:30:25.60 --> 02:30:28.96
into all these ideas that conservatives have.

2671
02:30:28.96 --> 02:30:32.000
And now I have to, because it comes out of my mouth,

2672
02:30:32.000 --> 02:30:36.44
and it's on film or recorded forever.

2673
02:30:36.44 --> 02:30:39.80
And so, you know, and it's also, you really have to think

2674
02:30:39.80 --> 02:30:42.40
about, you know, just like when I was in the platoon

2675
02:30:42.40 --> 02:30:46.84
and I became the recce guy, you know, squad,

2676
02:30:46.84 --> 02:30:48.68
and now I'm the task unit, you know,

2677
02:30:48.68 --> 02:30:53.52
or the whole task unit, those are all my folks now, you know?

2678
02:30:53.52 --> 02:30:56.44
So now I'm representing all of district one,

2679
02:30:56.44 --> 02:30:59.72
and I will represent district one.

2680
02:30:59.72 --> 02:31:01.20
So I gotta think about, you know,

2681
02:31:01.20 --> 02:31:03.20
what's gonna be right for everybody.

2682
02:31:03.20 --> 02:31:05.92
And, you know, I'll admit default.

2683
02:31:05.92 --> 02:31:08.08
I'm not, you know, that's how we fix things.

2684
02:31:08.08 --> 02:31:10.04
That's how we fix things in the teams and military.

2685
02:31:10.04 --> 02:31:15.04
If you can't say, hey, let's look at the result of that.

2686
02:31:15.04 --> 02:31:20.04
And, oh, that might have not been the right thing.

2687
02:31:20.08 --> 02:31:22.56
You're gonna keep going down there.

2688
02:31:22.56 --> 02:31:24.32
Politicians never do that.

2689
02:31:24.32 --> 02:31:26.04
They never admit to wrong.

2690
02:31:27.20 --> 02:31:28.80
I'm not that guy.

2691
02:31:28.80 --> 02:31:30.84
I am not polished.

2692
02:31:30.84 --> 02:31:32.44
But I've never run for office.

2693
02:31:32.44 --> 02:31:37.04
You'll notice I am, and, you know, and, hey, check.

2694
02:31:37.92 --> 02:31:42.000
But I'm honest, and I'll keep my integrity.

2695
02:31:42.000 --> 02:31:44.000
You know, I'll keep my beliefs.

2696
02:31:44.000 --> 02:31:49.000
And learning a lot about me is part of it

2697
02:31:50.92 --> 02:31:55.68
because you really have to think your decisions

2698
02:31:55.68 --> 02:32:00.24
are gonna weigh in and make affect lives.

2699
02:32:00.24 --> 02:32:01.68
Yeah, it's crazy with the politicians.

2700
02:32:01.68 --> 02:32:04.88
The number one to come out and say,

2701
02:32:04.88 --> 02:32:07.88
hey, this is the right answer.

2702
02:32:07.88 --> 02:32:08.72
About whatever.

2703
02:32:08.72 --> 02:32:09.56
You can say it about anything.

2704
02:32:09.56 --> 02:32:10.40
Right, right, right.

2705
02:32:10.40 --> 02:32:11.52
And anything, like, hey, this is the right answer.

2706
02:32:11.52 --> 02:32:12.64
This is what we need to do.

2707
02:32:12.64 --> 02:32:14.16
And then it doesn't work out as good

2708
02:32:14.16 --> 02:32:16.48
as they thought it would, or maybe it's even bad,

2709
02:32:16.48 --> 02:32:18.48
or whatever, but instead of saying,

2710
02:32:18.48 --> 02:32:20.84
hey, you know what, that is what I thought we should do.

2711
02:32:20.84 --> 02:32:22.56
It turns out there were some other factors

2712
02:32:22.56 --> 02:32:24.28
that were involved, and here's some adjustments

2713
02:32:24.28 --> 02:32:25.56
we need to make.

2714
02:32:25.56 --> 02:32:28.28
Instead, they just ride that parachute into the ground,

2715
02:32:28.28 --> 02:32:29.12
right?

2716
02:32:29.12 --> 02:32:30.80
Like, hey, this is the plan I came up with.

2717
02:32:30.80 --> 02:32:32.24
We're sticking with it.

2718
02:32:32.24 --> 02:32:34.36
And even when you come up with something,

2719
02:32:34.36 --> 02:32:37.40
I've been in leadership positions for a long time now.

2720
02:32:37.40 --> 02:32:40.96
I mean, I guess for at least 25 years

2721
02:32:40.96 --> 02:32:41.80
or something like that.

2722
02:32:41.80 --> 02:32:43.28
I've been in leadership positions.

2723
02:32:43.28 --> 02:32:48.28
And to say, hey, this is 100% right,

2724
02:32:49.32 --> 02:32:52.44
everyone else should be quiet is such a bad move.

2725
02:32:52.44 --> 02:32:54.52
Because the chances that you're so smart,

2726
02:32:54.52 --> 02:32:56.96
or that I'm so smart, that I'm gonna figure out

2727
02:32:56.96 --> 02:32:58.40
the best way to conduct this operation,

2728
02:32:58.40 --> 02:32:59.68
I'm gonna figure out the best solution

2729
02:32:59.68 --> 02:33:01.36
to this business problem we're having,

2730
02:33:01.36 --> 02:33:06.36
or I'm gonna come up with the problem-solving move over here.

2731
02:33:07.16 --> 02:33:10.40
The chances that I am just so smart

2732
02:33:10.40 --> 02:33:11.48
that I figure it all out.

2733
02:33:11.48 --> 02:33:12.32
No one else can figure it out,

2734
02:33:12.32 --> 02:33:13.52
but I figured it all out.

2735
02:33:13.52 --> 02:33:15.28
And by the way, when I figured out,

2736
02:33:15.28 --> 02:33:19.32
I calculate all the variables in the future.

2737
02:33:19.32 --> 02:33:21.04
Right, that's what I'm, I'm so smart

2738
02:33:21.04 --> 02:33:23.44
that I figure out all the future variables.

2739
02:33:23.44 --> 02:33:25.80
And I'm gonna get all those right as well.

2740
02:33:25.80 --> 02:33:27.76
That's how smart I am.

2741
02:33:27.76 --> 02:33:29.88
So why would you make statements

2742
02:33:29.88 --> 02:33:31.36
that you're 100% right about anything?

2743
02:33:31.36 --> 02:33:32.28
It's a dumb move.

2744
02:33:32.28 --> 02:33:34.96
And then when you're not, which is okay,

2745
02:33:34.96 --> 02:33:36.96
right, why would you not say, hey, you know what?

2746
02:33:36.96 --> 02:33:38.72
Here's what I thought was gonna happen.

2747
02:33:38.72 --> 02:33:40.04
Here's the plan we went with

2748
02:33:40.04 --> 02:33:41.76
because of that's what I thought,

2749
02:33:41.76 --> 02:33:44.08
and that was the consensus, and then it was wrong,

2750
02:33:44.08 --> 02:33:45.80
and here's the adjustments we're gonna make.

2751
02:33:45.80 --> 02:33:46.64
No big deal.

2752
02:33:46.64 --> 02:33:47.48
Right.

2753
02:33:47.48 --> 02:33:48.32
No big deal.

2754
02:33:48.32 --> 02:33:50.88
I've worked for bosses, and I know you've worked for bosses

2755
02:33:50.88 --> 02:33:52.32
that pretended like or thought

2756
02:33:52.32 --> 02:33:54.44
that they had the 100% solution.

2757
02:33:54.44 --> 02:33:58.80
And then they won't back down from their decision,

2758
02:33:58.80 --> 02:34:00.32
even when it's wrong.

2759
02:34:00.32 --> 02:34:04.12
And they think their respect is gonna go down,

2760
02:34:04.12 --> 02:34:06.92
that people respect them less if they say, hey, I was wrong.

2761
02:34:06.92 --> 02:34:09.12
But it's absolutely the opposite is true.

2762
02:34:09.12 --> 02:34:11.04
When I say, hey, I screwed this up,

2763
02:34:11.04 --> 02:34:12.88
people go, oh, okay, police, Jock was humble enough

2764
02:34:12.88 --> 02:34:13.72
to admit that he was wrong,

2765
02:34:13.72 --> 02:34:15.44
and he's gonna make some adjustments now.

2766
02:34:15.44 --> 02:34:16.68
Nothing wrong with that.

2767
02:34:16.68 --> 02:34:19.88
We haven't, politicians have not learned that lesson yet.

2768
02:34:19.88 --> 02:34:20.72
Right.

2769
02:34:22.96 --> 02:34:26.44
The fear of the sound bite, the fear that, you know,

2770
02:34:26.44 --> 02:34:27.92
well, you should step down

2771
02:34:27.92 --> 02:34:29.92
because you made that bad decision.

2772
02:34:29.92 --> 02:34:33.44
No, that was a wrong decision.

2773
02:34:33.44 --> 02:34:34.24
I admit it's wrong.

2774
02:34:34.24 --> 02:34:35.60
We're gonna move forward.

2775
02:34:35.60 --> 02:34:38.76
And, you know, I'll make mistakes.

2776
02:34:38.76 --> 02:34:41.76
And I'll admit it and we'll figure something out

2777
02:34:41.76 --> 02:34:43.36
to find what's better.

2778
02:34:43.36 --> 02:34:45.80
But that's not happening right now.

2779
02:34:45.80 --> 02:34:48.24
It's not happening and it's got to, you know,

2780
02:34:48.24 --> 02:34:51.64
if anybody thinks it was okay to mask kids up

2781
02:34:52.56 --> 02:34:55.76
that are, you know, born when this thing started

2782
02:34:55.76 --> 02:34:58.20
and they've never seen a human face

2783
02:34:58.20 --> 02:35:01.40
except their parents for two plus years, that's insane.

2784
02:35:02.48 --> 02:35:06.56
Hey, you know, the development, you know,

2785
02:35:06.56 --> 02:35:08.72
been slowed down in all our children.

2786
02:35:08.72 --> 02:35:10.80
And was that really worth it?

2787
02:35:10.80 --> 02:35:14.08
You know, was that worth shutting down businesses?

2788
02:35:14.08 --> 02:35:19.08
You know, we got folks that their business was shut down

2789
02:35:19.96 --> 02:35:21.96
and they sold out and they're never gonna

2790
02:35:21.96 --> 02:35:23.56
open them back up again.

2791
02:35:23.56 --> 02:35:26.000
And was that really worth it?

2792
02:35:26.000 --> 02:35:28.28
You know, while saying that everybody can go to work

2793
02:35:28.28 --> 02:35:30.84
in the big box stores and you're actually having

2794
02:35:30.84 --> 02:35:32.88
more people in the big box stores?

2795
02:35:32.88 --> 02:35:34.20
Is that right?

2796
02:35:34.20 --> 02:35:36.64
You know, instead of spreading it out

2797
02:35:36.64 --> 02:35:38.32
to all the other stores while keeping them

2798
02:35:38.32 --> 02:35:42.44
because that's a human, that's that individual's decision.

2799
02:35:42.44 --> 02:35:43.72
Yeah.

2800
02:35:43.72 --> 02:35:46.68
And you go, look, sometimes you're in a scenario

2801
02:35:46.68 --> 02:35:48.28
you don't know what's gonna happen.

2802
02:35:48.28 --> 02:35:50.48
Like, hey, there's a bunch of people dying in Adelaide.

2803
02:35:50.48 --> 02:35:53.24
Like, okay, well, we're gonna lock some stuff down here.

2804
02:35:53.24 --> 02:35:55.02
Okay, well, okay, got it.

2805
02:35:56.20 --> 02:35:59.000
And then like a few weeks go by and then a month goes by

2806
02:35:59.000 --> 02:36:02.40
and you say, hey, it seems like in other areas of the world

2807
02:36:02.40 --> 02:36:07.40
this isn't that bad and all of a sudden you can't,

2808
02:36:07.64 --> 02:36:10.72
no one says, hey, we need to adjust our thought process

2809
02:36:10.72 --> 02:36:11.56
right now.

2810
02:36:11.56 --> 02:36:12.40
Right.

2811
02:36:12.40 --> 02:36:14.72
We made some rash decisions early on

2812
02:36:14.72 --> 02:36:16.24
because we didn't know what was going on.

2813
02:36:16.24 --> 02:36:20.04
And you know, if you're my boss and you make a rash decision

2814
02:36:20.04 --> 02:36:21.08
because you don't know what's going on

2815
02:36:21.08 --> 02:36:22.84
and I don't know what's going on, I go, okay, well,

2816
02:36:22.84 --> 02:36:24.72
hey man, let's give it a try.

2817
02:36:24.72 --> 02:36:26.32
So no one knows what's happening.

2818
02:36:26.32 --> 02:36:27.98
Let's err on the side of safety.

2819
02:36:29.16 --> 02:36:31.16
But then when you start seeing, you know,

2820
02:36:31.16 --> 02:36:33.76
other information come in and you say, wait a second,

2821
02:36:33.76 --> 02:36:35.52
this doesn't seem like it's as bad.

2822
02:36:35.52 --> 02:36:38.56
And we had people just holding the line on stuff

2823
02:36:38.56 --> 02:36:39.76
that didn't make any sense.

2824
02:36:39.76 --> 02:36:41.72
I mean, there's some kind of a,

2825
02:36:41.72 --> 02:36:44.000
there's something in California going on right now

2826
02:36:44.000 --> 02:36:49.000
where the Indian casinos stayed open.

2827
02:36:50.44 --> 02:36:53.60
And the other casinos are mad.

2828
02:36:53.60 --> 02:36:56.56
I don't know if I know enough about it to talk about

2829
02:36:56.56 --> 02:37:00.000
because I saw an advertisement or read an advertisement

2830
02:37:00.000 --> 02:37:04.12
about it, but the other casinos are mad that they were open

2831
02:37:04.12 --> 02:37:05.40
and that they were able to make money.

2832
02:37:05.40 --> 02:37:08.92
They said, they profited when the other casinos shut down

2833
02:37:08.92 --> 02:37:11.28
and I'm like, thinking to myself, hey,

2834
02:37:11.28 --> 02:37:13.20
if I was in charge of a casino

2835
02:37:13.20 --> 02:37:15.08
and there was a bunch of casinos that were open

2836
02:37:15.08 --> 02:37:19.28
and everything was okay, that seems like an indicator to me

2837
02:37:19.28 --> 02:37:20.12
that maybe it's okay.

2838
02:37:20.12 --> 02:37:23.48
Like when we had the Super Bowl in Los Angeles, California

2839
02:37:23.48 --> 02:37:27.96
and there was 90,000 people in the arena

2840
02:37:27.96 --> 02:37:32.12
and it was no super spreader, there wasn't a bunch of people.

2841
02:37:32.12 --> 02:37:34.16
And yet they went back to masks again.

2842
02:37:34.16 --> 02:37:36.16
It was like, you can't make this up.

2843
02:37:36.16 --> 02:37:37.000
Right.

2844
02:37:38.88 --> 02:37:43.88
The roller coaster of, you must do this

2845
02:37:44.60 --> 02:37:47.56
and then you see the politician doing that,

2846
02:37:47.56 --> 02:37:49.56
doing exactly what they said, don't do.

2847
02:37:50.92 --> 02:37:55.92
And it's like, hey, it's very disturbing.

2848
02:37:55.92 --> 02:37:58.44
Yeah, it's very disturbing.

2849
02:37:58.44 --> 02:38:02.64
And again, I have the, well, I live in California,

2850
02:38:02.64 --> 02:38:03.84
Echo Charles lives in California,

2851
02:38:03.84 --> 02:38:05.36
where we were like ground zero

2852
02:38:05.36 --> 02:38:07.92
for the politicians saying one thing

2853
02:38:07.92 --> 02:38:10.12
and doing something completely different,

2854
02:38:10.12 --> 02:38:15.12
which you can, Americans will only stand for that stuff

2855
02:38:16.84 --> 02:38:18.68
for so long.

2856
02:38:18.68 --> 02:38:21.76
And it was actually longer than I thought in many cases.

2857
02:38:21.76 --> 02:38:23.76
It was sometimes like, hey man,

2858
02:38:23.76 --> 02:38:28.76
like, we had a revolution against England

2859
02:38:31.52 --> 02:38:36.52
because they raised the taxes two cents on our bushels of tea.

2860
02:38:36.96 --> 02:38:38.72
And we're like, all right, you know what, that's enough.

2861
02:38:38.72 --> 02:38:39.56
We're done.

2862
02:38:39.56 --> 02:38:40.40
You know?

2863
02:38:40.40 --> 02:38:43.96
And so there's only so much Americans can take.

2864
02:38:43.96 --> 02:38:46.56
I think they definitely got pushed to the limit of that.

2865
02:38:46.56 --> 02:38:48.96
They took more than I thought, you know?

2866
02:38:48.96 --> 02:38:51.52
Especially as time dragged on.

2867
02:38:51.52 --> 02:38:55.96
But what's really disturbing is just the decisive,

2868
02:38:55.96 --> 02:38:59.60
the divisiveness that you mentioned already,

2869
02:38:59.60 --> 02:39:03.36
where it's like, well, it doesn't seem like in retrospect

2870
02:39:03.36 --> 02:39:07.28
that putting masks on little kids was a good idea

2871
02:39:07.28 --> 02:39:09.04
for two years.

2872
02:39:09.04 --> 02:39:10.48
And inside of people going, yeah,

2873
02:39:10.48 --> 02:39:12.28
that definitely seems like it was a bad idea

2874
02:39:12.28 --> 02:39:14.24
and we should try and learn from that in the future.

2875
02:39:14.24 --> 02:39:16.04
Instead they're like, no.

2876
02:39:16.04 --> 02:39:17.72
Right, no.

2877
02:39:17.72 --> 02:39:21.64
You're like, hey man, what reality are you in?

2878
02:39:21.64 --> 02:39:22.48
Right.

2879
02:39:22.48 --> 02:39:23.88
What reality are you in?

2880
02:39:23.88 --> 02:39:28.08
Well, watching them from afar dump sand

2881
02:39:28.08 --> 02:39:31.04
in the skate parks of California.

2882
02:39:31.04 --> 02:39:34.28
And put two by fours across basketball hoops.

2883
02:39:34.28 --> 02:39:39.28
And I was up in Baxter State Park.

2884
02:39:40.64 --> 02:39:45.64
It's a 13 mile ski uphill to get where you can stay

2885
02:39:45.64 --> 02:39:48.68
and sleep for, take a break.

2886
02:39:48.68 --> 02:39:52.36
And then it's another three miles up much steeper terrain

2887
02:39:52.36 --> 02:39:54.28
to where you're gonna start to do actual,

2888
02:39:54.28 --> 02:39:57.84
you know, ice climbing and all that.

2889
02:39:57.84 --> 02:40:01.28
So we made it 16 miles in uphill.

2890
02:40:01.28 --> 02:40:03.16
There's nobody in the park.

2891
02:40:03.16 --> 02:40:05.88
You know, that's the cool thing about Baxter

2892
02:40:05.88 --> 02:40:09.72
is in the winter is you cannot drive in there.

2893
02:40:09.72 --> 02:40:11.80
You've got very limited people

2894
02:40:11.80 --> 02:40:13.84
and they only allow so many people in there.

2895
02:40:13.84 --> 02:40:16.44
We're away from everybody.

2896
02:40:16.44 --> 02:40:18.64
Park Ranger comes up very sad.

2897
02:40:19.72 --> 02:40:21.56
You have to go home now.

2898
02:40:21.56 --> 02:40:22.64
We just made it here.

2899
02:40:24.72 --> 02:40:27.40
There's nobody, there's nobody within, you know,

2900
02:40:27.40 --> 02:40:28.88
50 miles from us.

2901
02:40:28.88 --> 02:40:33.28
I mean, you know, and so we had to, you know,

2902
02:40:33.28 --> 02:40:38.28
ski out of, you know, back down the hill of the mountain.

2903
02:40:39.12 --> 02:40:43.24
And that was so insanely disturbing.

2904
02:40:43.24 --> 02:40:46.44
And it came down from the Secretary of State,

2905
02:40:46.44 --> 02:40:48.12
I believe is what they said.

2906
02:40:48.88 --> 02:40:52.08
And that was so, we were isolated.

2907
02:40:52.08 --> 02:40:54.36
We were away from everybody.

2908
02:40:54.36 --> 02:40:59.36
You know, a lot of this has to do with the ecosystem

2909
02:40:59.64 --> 02:41:03.12
that, and really the digital ecosystem

2910
02:41:03.12 --> 02:41:04.76
that a human being lives within.

2911
02:41:04.76 --> 02:41:05.60
Right.

2912
02:41:05.60 --> 02:41:10.60
Because I know people that were in the ecosystem of,

2913
02:41:10.60 --> 02:41:15.84
you know, COVID was the most heinous disease

2914
02:41:15.84 --> 02:41:18.28
that ever came to the world.

2915
02:41:18.28 --> 02:41:20.76
And these are people that are friends that I know

2916
02:41:20.76 --> 02:41:23.36
are normal, like logical people,

2917
02:41:23.36 --> 02:41:26.40
but their digital ecosystem,

2918
02:41:26.40 --> 02:41:30.60
the word inside there, the truth inside

2919
02:41:30.60 --> 02:41:35.28
that digital ecosystem was just so closed loop

2920
02:41:35.28 --> 02:41:39.12
that there was no other perspectives coming in whatsoever.

2921
02:41:39.12 --> 02:41:43.88
And it was very disturbing to see,

2922
02:41:43.88 --> 02:41:48.88
to see people that their world was so closed loop

2923
02:41:51.20 --> 02:41:56.04
that they couldn't comprehend another viewpoint at all.

2924
02:41:56.04 --> 02:42:01.04
And part of that ecosystem was to protect itself

2925
02:42:01.20 --> 02:42:02.60
from outside thought.

2926
02:42:02.60 --> 02:42:05.84
And so anybody that offered some other perspective

2927
02:42:05.84 --> 02:42:08.52
was immediately attacked.

2928
02:42:08.52 --> 02:42:08.86
Right.

2929
02:42:08.86 --> 02:42:11.08
It wasn't a, you couldn't have a conversation

2930
02:42:11.08 --> 02:42:13.80
with someone in that other ecosystem.

2931
02:42:13.80 --> 02:42:15.80
You couldn't have a conversation with them about it

2932
02:42:15.80 --> 02:42:20.16
because they would go on the attack

2933
02:42:20.16 --> 02:42:25.04
and they would utilize the truths in air quotes,

2934
02:42:25.04 --> 02:42:28.28
the supposed truths from inside their ecosystem,

2935
02:42:28.28 --> 02:42:32.68
which they truly believed that they were true.

2936
02:42:32.68 --> 02:42:36.40
And it was, honestly, it was very sad to see.

2937
02:42:36.40 --> 02:42:39.56
It was very sad to see people going through that.

2938
02:42:39.56 --> 02:42:44.12
And I would try and address it a little bit with people,

2939
02:42:44.12 --> 02:42:47.84
maybe mention to them something from outside

2940
02:42:47.84 --> 02:42:51.80
their closed loop and they would go on the attack

2941
02:42:51.80 --> 02:42:54.68
and go super defensive and it wasn't worth it.

2942
02:42:54.68 --> 02:42:56.24
I want to maintain a relationship with a person

2943
02:42:56.24 --> 02:42:58.28
that I've known for 10 years or 12 years or 20 years.

2944
02:42:58.28 --> 02:43:00.000
They're your friend.

2945
02:43:00.000 --> 02:43:03.24
And I don't want to fight with them over this thing.

2946
02:43:03.24 --> 02:43:05.88
It's like, okay, if you want to continue to live,

2947
02:43:05.88 --> 02:43:09.48
like literally quarantine yourself inside your house

2948
02:43:09.48 --> 02:43:13.92
and we met at an outdoor place to say hi

2949
02:43:15.000 --> 02:43:17.64
and just mentioning that, well, hey,

2950
02:43:17.64 --> 02:43:20.36
just so you know, like I'm training Jiu-Jitsu.

2951
02:43:20.36 --> 02:43:22.20
Right, and I've been training Jiu-Jitsu with my friends

2952
02:43:22.20 --> 02:43:25.36
and all the time and like none of us are sick

2953
02:43:25.36 --> 02:43:28.48
and everyone's okay and just to see the look of horror

2954
02:43:28.48 --> 02:43:32.40
in their eyes, almost as if I was one

2955
02:43:32.40 --> 02:43:34.60
of the worst human beings ever,

2956
02:43:34.60 --> 02:43:37.60
it was really sad to see, but again,

2957
02:43:37.60 --> 02:43:40.64
I think a lot of it has to do with,

2958
02:43:40.64 --> 02:43:42.56
you know, you got to open up your perspective.

2959
02:43:42.56 --> 02:43:44.40
You know, you got to open up your perspective

2960
02:43:44.40 --> 02:43:47.64
and you got to listen to more than one

2961
02:43:48.80 --> 02:43:51.80
more than one ecosystem of information.

2962
02:43:51.80 --> 02:43:53.24
Otherwise, you're not seeing everything.

2963
02:43:53.24 --> 02:43:55.52
And look, you can go far to the other side

2964
02:43:55.52 --> 02:43:57.16
of the spectrum as well.

2965
02:43:57.16 --> 02:44:00.16
And you can get just as wrapped up in that ecosystem

2966
02:44:00.16 --> 02:44:02.68
where you don't listen to anybody else.

2967
02:44:02.68 --> 02:44:07.08
So it's a very strange time and I think, you know,

2968
02:44:08.08 --> 02:44:11.08
I always find that people run into a problem

2969
02:44:11.08 --> 02:44:12.000
with their ego, right?

2970
02:44:12.000 --> 02:44:13.08
Same thing that we just talked about

2971
02:44:13.08 --> 02:44:13.92
if I'm a politician.

2972
02:44:13.92 --> 02:44:16.60
My ego won't allow me to say I was wrong.

2973
02:44:16.60 --> 02:44:18.32
My ego won't allow me to say,

2974
02:44:18.32 --> 02:44:19.88
hey, I don't know what to do,

2975
02:44:19.88 --> 02:44:21.04
but this is what I think we should do.

2976
02:44:21.04 --> 02:44:22.000
Let's try this.

2977
02:44:22.000 --> 02:44:23.60
My ego says, no, you know everything.

2978
02:44:23.60 --> 02:44:25.000
I know everything.

2979
02:44:25.000 --> 02:44:27.000
I'm not gonna make any mistakes.

2980
02:44:27.000 --> 02:44:28.12
Well, the same thing happens

2981
02:44:28.12 --> 02:44:30.08
when it comes to processing information.

2982
02:44:30.08 --> 02:44:34.20
You get your root idea that you believe

2983
02:44:34.20 --> 02:44:36.48
and you don't want to admit,

2984
02:44:36.48 --> 02:44:37.32
hey, you know what?

2985
02:44:37.32 --> 02:44:38.32
I was actually wrong about that.

2986
02:44:38.32 --> 02:44:40.56
I was actually, that wasn't a good idea.

2987
02:44:40.56 --> 02:44:41.92
Or you know what?

2988
02:44:41.92 --> 02:44:44.16
That's what I thought a month ago.

2989
02:44:44.16 --> 02:44:46.24
And clearly there's new information

2990
02:44:46.24 --> 02:44:48.24
that I should process and pay attention to.

2991
02:44:48.24 --> 02:44:51.04
And people just unfortunately aren't thinking

2992
02:44:51.04 --> 02:44:52.16
that way anymore.

2993
02:44:52.16 --> 02:44:54.84
And it's like this weird tribalism

2994
02:44:54.84 --> 02:44:57.40
that takes hold that's crazy to see.

2995
02:44:57.40 --> 02:45:00.12
It's gonna be Rwanda, dude.

2996
02:45:00.12 --> 02:45:01.28
You have to know somebody

2997
02:45:01.28 --> 02:45:03.28
to actually know that they're different than you.

2998
02:45:03.28 --> 02:45:06.80
And that didn't go very well.

2999
02:45:06.80 --> 02:45:08.68
I mean, they had to know each other.

3000
02:45:08.68 --> 02:45:12.04
What's going on with the lobstermen up in Maine?

3001
02:45:12.04 --> 02:45:12.88
I'll tell you what.

3002
02:45:12.88 --> 02:45:17.88
Just because I look, this is such a huge deal in Maine.

3003
02:45:17.88 --> 02:45:18.72
What is this?

3004
02:45:18.72 --> 02:45:20.60
A $2 billion industry in Maine?

3005
02:45:20.60 --> 02:45:22.04
$2 billion, yeah.

3006
02:45:22.04 --> 02:45:23.72
$2 billion industry.

3007
02:45:23.72 --> 02:45:28.72
This is, when you think of Maine, you think lobster.

3008
02:45:29.56 --> 02:45:32.08
Of course, hey, I hope you think OriginUSA.

3009
02:45:32.08 --> 02:45:34.44
I hope you think about making jeans, right?

3010
02:45:34.44 --> 02:45:35.28
100%.

3011
02:45:35.28 --> 02:45:36.12
I hope you think about boots.

3012
02:45:36.12 --> 02:45:38.48
I hope you think about the best Jujutsu geese in the world.

3013
02:45:38.48 --> 02:45:39.96
You're gonna think about that stuff too.

3014
02:45:39.96 --> 02:45:42.60
But before that, I have to admit,

3015
02:45:42.60 --> 02:45:44.12
you're thinking about lobster

3016
02:45:44.12 --> 02:45:49.12
because Maine is the epicenter of lobster.

3017
02:45:49.76 --> 02:45:52.56
It's life in Maine.

3018
02:45:52.56 --> 02:45:54.48
And so what is going on?

3019
02:45:54.48 --> 02:45:57.64
Yeah, no one wants a Massachusetts or a Canadian lobster.

3020
02:45:57.64 --> 02:45:59.20
I've never seen an advertisement

3021
02:45:59.20 --> 02:46:02.04
for fresh Massachusetts lobster, right?

3022
02:46:02.04 --> 02:46:03.52
No, they want Maine lobster.

3023
02:46:03.52 --> 02:46:05.04
No offense to Massachusetts.

3024
02:46:05.04 --> 02:46:08.12
No offense to Canada, but you want Maine lobster.

3025
02:46:08.12 --> 02:46:10.36
So they're coming up with all these ideas,

3026
02:46:11.44 --> 02:46:13.52
the right whale up there,

3027
02:46:13.52 --> 02:46:15.08
which is not even in the Maine waters.

3028
02:46:15.08 --> 02:46:16.52
They haven't seen it.

3029
02:46:16.52 --> 02:46:19.04
And they had an entanglement.

3030
02:46:19.04 --> 02:46:20.24
Hold on, I'm just gonna clarify this.

3031
02:46:20.24 --> 02:46:21.56
So it's called the right whale.

3032
02:46:21.56 --> 02:46:25.88
This is a breed of whale called the right whale.

3033
02:46:25.88 --> 02:46:28.96
Yeah, it writes itself, when it dies,

3034
02:46:28.96 --> 02:46:32.80
it writes itself in the water and it floats.

3035
02:46:32.80 --> 02:46:35.28
So if there are a whole bunch of dead right whales,

3036
02:46:35.28 --> 02:46:36.76
they're gonna all be floating.

3037
02:46:36.76 --> 02:46:39.32
You know, they actually, history,

3038
02:46:39.32 --> 02:46:43.48
they used to chunk it up and bring it on the ship in pieces

3039
02:46:43.48 --> 02:46:45.72
because it would be just floating there.

3040
02:46:45.72 --> 02:46:48.36
And that's the other part of the,

3041
02:46:48.36 --> 02:46:49.36
one of the parts of,

3042
02:46:49.36 --> 02:46:51.96
hey, it doesn't make sense what you guys are talking about.

3043
02:46:54.36 --> 02:46:56.44
They're coming up with all these ideas to,

3044
02:46:57.56 --> 02:46:58.76
save the right whale,

3045
02:46:58.76 --> 02:47:00.68
but they're looking at the lobster man.

3046
02:47:00.68 --> 02:47:02.52
The lobster man, not the problem.

3047
02:47:02.52 --> 02:47:05.40
Everything from the size of the pectoral fin,

3048
02:47:05.40 --> 02:47:06.68
and they don't have a notch in it,

3049
02:47:06.68 --> 02:47:09.44
where the humpback whale has a notch

3050
02:47:09.44 --> 02:47:11.64
and a huge pectoral fin that would get caught

3051
02:47:11.64 --> 02:47:12.76
in a horizontal rope.

3052
02:47:13.76 --> 02:47:16.80
All these things they wanna do don't need to be done.

3053
02:47:16.80 --> 02:47:18.32
It's ship strikes that kills them.

3054
02:47:18.32 --> 02:47:22.36
And it's Canadian snow crab gear that does it.

3055
02:47:22.36 --> 02:47:25.36
The main lobster man have done all these things

3056
02:47:25.36 --> 02:47:27.56
to take care of it and get it out of the way.

3057
02:47:27.56 --> 02:47:29.92
And some of the things that they do, for instance,

3058
02:47:29.92 --> 02:47:32.72
is they put like breakaways in the lines, right?

3059
02:47:32.72 --> 02:47:34.88
So if I was a right whale,

3060
02:47:34.88 --> 02:47:39.84
and I got caught up in a main lobster man's line,

3061
02:47:39.84 --> 02:47:41.76
it's designed to break.

3062
02:47:41.76 --> 02:47:43.76
And I get out and I'm fine.

3063
02:47:43.76 --> 02:47:44.60
You're good.

3064
02:47:44.60 --> 02:47:45.44
And they've already done that.

3065
02:47:45.44 --> 02:47:46.28
They've already done that.

3066
02:47:46.28 --> 02:47:48.12
Well, all the ropes are all identified.

3067
02:47:48.12 --> 02:47:52.44
So if it does get caught in a main lobster man gear,

3068
02:47:52.44 --> 02:47:55.12
it's identified as main lobster gear.

3069
02:47:55.12 --> 02:47:56.76
And they put several breaks in it.

3070
02:47:57.68 --> 02:48:00.16
It's all been done and taken care of.

3071
02:48:00.16 --> 02:48:03.24
And it really was, hasn't been a problem ever.

3072
02:48:04.88 --> 02:48:09.88
But the National Marine Fisheries Services,

3073
02:48:10.56 --> 02:48:15.44
they made a decision that if a whale dies in Canada,

3074
02:48:16.52 --> 02:48:17.84
we take credit for it.

3075
02:48:17.84 --> 02:48:19.84
We're half credit for it.

3076
02:48:19.84 --> 02:48:22.36
So one died there and we're getting blamed

3077
02:48:22.36 --> 02:48:24.04
and we're gonna shut down our industry.

3078
02:48:24.04 --> 02:48:27.28
And no one made, they're under NOAA, right?

3079
02:48:27.28 --> 02:48:28.44
Explain what NOAA is.

3080
02:48:28.44 --> 02:48:29.36
Yeah, NOAA.

3081
02:48:29.36 --> 02:48:34.16
Yep, National Oceanographic Atmospheric Administration.

3082
02:48:34.16 --> 02:48:38.96
And it's everything from mapping and weather in the ocean.

3083
02:48:38.96 --> 02:48:40.88
And they have subcategories.

3084
02:48:40.88 --> 02:48:45.44
And one is National Marine Fisheries Services.

3085
02:48:45.44 --> 02:48:49.88
And they came up with this study,

3086
02:48:50.84 --> 02:48:53.12
and there's cryptic deaths.

3087
02:48:53.12 --> 02:48:57.20
So if they get one death, they assume there's three more,

3088
02:48:57.20 --> 02:48:59.32
even though these things are gonna float.

3089
02:48:59.32 --> 02:49:03.32
And they stopped, they had crews that were

3090
02:49:04.68 --> 02:49:06.72
detanglement crews, well, they disband them all

3091
02:49:06.72 --> 02:49:08.32
because they're not entanglements.

3092
02:49:08.32 --> 02:49:11.40
They had observers out there

3093
02:49:11.40 --> 02:49:13.16
or they don't have any observers anymore

3094
02:49:13.16 --> 02:49:15.40
because they're not there.

3095
02:49:15.40 --> 02:49:18.72
And still they're trying to get them to modify things

3096
02:49:18.72 --> 02:49:21.12
in a manner that will shut the industry down.

3097
02:49:21.12 --> 02:49:25.64
So give me an example of what the NOAA,

3098
02:49:25.64 --> 02:49:28.000
what do they wanna modify for the lobstermen?

3099
02:49:29.44 --> 02:49:31.40
They're really trying to get them to bite in

3100
02:49:31.40 --> 02:49:35.08
and weigh in on the decisions that are gonna harm them.

3101
02:49:35.08 --> 02:49:38.56
So closures of the prime areas.

3102
02:49:38.56 --> 02:49:43.56
So prime areas of where you drop lobster pots

3103
02:49:45.80 --> 02:49:47.88
and catch lobsters, they wanna shut them down.

3104
02:49:47.88 --> 02:49:51.12
They wanna shut them down, they wanna try ropless gear,

3105
02:49:51.12 --> 02:49:54.72
which is, in the short, remote control,

3106
02:49:54.72 --> 02:49:56.44
a buoy pops up from the trap

3107
02:49:56.44 --> 02:49:58.76
and you've got 10 to 20 traps strung out

3108
02:49:58.76 --> 02:50:00.40
and you're gonna count that this,

3109
02:50:01.28 --> 02:50:02.64
you're dropping it in,

3110
02:50:02.64 --> 02:50:05.24
no one's gonna know where the traps are

3111
02:50:05.24 --> 02:50:08.76
because you might drop them in six knots of current

3112
02:50:08.76 --> 02:50:11.68
in a string and they're gonna drop 150 feet,

3113
02:50:13.64 --> 02:50:15.000
even further.

3114
02:50:15.000 --> 02:50:18.08
How much does a lobster trap

3115
02:50:18.08 --> 02:50:20.84
with some kind of a radio activated?

3116
02:50:20.84 --> 02:50:24.68
Or a sonar activated to get the buoy to pop up?

3117
02:50:24.68 --> 02:50:25.76
Yeah, it's gonna be,

3118
02:50:25.76 --> 02:50:27.16
whatever they end up doing,

3119
02:50:29.40 --> 02:50:31.56
they're about four grand.

3120
02:50:31.56 --> 02:50:34.40
A regular lobster buoy, 10 bucks.

3121
02:50:34.40 --> 02:50:36.56
So who's gonna be able to do that?

3122
02:50:36.56 --> 02:50:38.44
It's gonna be big giant,

3123
02:50:41.04 --> 02:50:43.92
big box store, Walmart, China,

3124
02:50:43.92 --> 02:50:47.20
taking over our lobster industry, can't happen.

3125
02:50:47.20 --> 02:50:50.52
Because regular mom and pop can't do that,

3126
02:50:51.52 --> 02:50:53.000
absorb that cost.

3127
02:50:54.88 --> 02:50:58.92
We were looking at getting another seafood processing plant

3128
02:50:58.92 --> 02:51:02.000
built in Maine instead of shipping it up to Canada

3129
02:51:02.000 --> 02:51:05.44
and that's just like the oil industry,

3130
02:51:05.44 --> 02:51:08.40
they're not gonna build another refinery

3131
02:51:08.40 --> 02:51:10.92
because they can't have a guarantee that

3132
02:51:10.92 --> 02:51:12.72
the oil industry is gonna be around.

3133
02:51:14.36 --> 02:51:19.04
Just so they're not building that seafood processing plant.

3134
02:51:19.04 --> 02:51:21.84
There's a whole other slew of jobs in the construction

3135
02:51:21.84 --> 02:51:24.40
and running of that that are gone.

3136
02:51:27.04 --> 02:51:30.40
It's gonna have a crazy ripple effect across Maine.

3137
02:51:30.40 --> 02:51:34.68
When people come there, to go to Reds Eats

3138
02:51:34.68 --> 02:51:37.88
and stand an hour and a half in a line,

3139
02:51:37.88 --> 02:51:40.36
they'll go eat a lobster roll.

3140
02:51:40.36 --> 02:51:43.44
Yeah, like I said, when you think of Maine,

3141
02:51:43.44 --> 02:51:46.04
you think of lobster 100%.

3142
02:51:46.04 --> 02:51:46.88
Yeah.

3143
02:51:46.88 --> 02:51:48.40
So to shut this down would be insane.

3144
02:51:48.40 --> 02:51:53.24
So what will you be able to do when you're elected?

3145
02:51:53.24 --> 02:51:57.44
Well, the voice has to come out loud.

3146
02:51:57.44 --> 02:52:01.92
You know, we're gonna look at cutting funding

3147
02:52:01.92 --> 02:52:04.16
for the piece that's causing the problem.

3148
02:52:05.12 --> 02:52:07.52
They got a job to do, I got it,

3149
02:52:07.52 --> 02:52:09.32
but if they're looking at it,

3150
02:52:09.32 --> 02:52:11.24
and if they're looking at the lobstermen

3151
02:52:11.24 --> 02:52:13.96
and they're not looking at where they need to look,

3152
02:52:14.84 --> 02:52:16.04
then they're killing right whales

3153
02:52:16.04 --> 02:52:20.80
by accusing the lobstermen of being the culprit.

3154
02:52:20.80 --> 02:52:24.32
You know, once you focus in on one thing,

3155
02:52:24.32 --> 02:52:26.60
you're not looking to take care of the problem.

3156
02:52:26.60 --> 02:52:31.24
You know, it's ship strikes and a lot of pleasure crafts

3157
02:52:31.24 --> 02:52:34.000
and folks trying to get too close to the whales,

3158
02:52:34.000 --> 02:52:36.16
but it's not the Maine lobstermen.

3159
02:52:36.16 --> 02:52:40.16
It's snow crab traps way up in Canada.

3160
02:52:40.16 --> 02:52:43.28
And we get accounted for, like I said earlier,

3161
02:52:43.28 --> 02:52:47.64
death there, that's insane.

3162
02:52:47.64 --> 02:52:50.64
And that's America doing it.

3163
02:52:50.64 --> 02:52:53.72
That's NOAA, that's National Marine Fisheries Services

3164
02:52:53.72 --> 02:52:54.56
doing that.

3165
02:52:54.56 --> 02:52:57.000
Why is this happening?

3166
02:52:57.000 --> 02:53:02.000
Okay, so if I'm, let's say I love animals, which I do.

3167
02:53:02.12 --> 02:53:04.84
Let's say I love whales, which I guess I kind of love whales.

3168
02:53:04.84 --> 02:53:06.88
I mean, whales are cool animals.

3169
02:53:06.88 --> 02:53:09.80
I mean, I can see them from my house and it's awesome.

3170
02:53:09.80 --> 02:53:11.60
You know, I look out and we can see them sprain

3171
02:53:11.60 --> 02:53:14.56
and we see, they come pretty close to the lineup

3172
02:53:14.56 --> 02:53:15.68
sometimes surfing.

3173
02:53:15.68 --> 02:53:16.68
It's pretty awesome.

3174
02:53:18.000 --> 02:53:21.44
So let's say I do, whales are awesome.

3175
02:53:21.44 --> 02:53:22.40
I wanna protect whales.

3176
02:53:22.40 --> 02:53:23.80
And then I start going, oh, well,

3177
02:53:23.80 --> 02:53:25.40
maybe these lobster traps could kill them

3178
02:53:25.40 --> 02:53:26.68
and that seems bad.

3179
02:53:26.68 --> 02:53:29.16
And then I start doing the research

3180
02:53:29.16 --> 02:53:31.000
and I see that they can break out of the lines

3181
02:53:31.000 --> 02:53:31.84
if they get tangled,

3182
02:53:31.84 --> 02:53:33.28
because we put this into place.

3183
02:53:33.28 --> 02:53:37.68
I see that they're counting, what'd you say, mystery deaths?

3184
02:53:37.68 --> 02:53:39.44
Cryptic, they call it cryptic death.

3185
02:53:39.44 --> 02:53:42.68
So if they find one dead, they say there's three more.

3186
02:53:42.68 --> 02:53:46.96
Okay, so now I say I've got, I'm multiplying.

3187
02:53:46.96 --> 02:53:49.68
When I start running the numbers on this,

3188
02:53:49.68 --> 02:53:51.52
it doesn't make any sense to do that

3189
02:53:51.52 --> 02:53:52.60
because this whale floats.

3190
02:53:52.60 --> 02:53:55.000
So why would we say that it's dead?

3191
02:53:55.000 --> 02:53:56.52
So as I start looking at this, I start saying,

3192
02:53:56.52 --> 02:53:58.76
well, this doesn't seem like it's a problem.

3193
02:53:58.76 --> 02:54:01.40
Let's focus on, you know, some other issue

3194
02:54:01.40 --> 02:54:04.84
because apparently the, because it is apparent

3195
02:54:04.84 --> 02:54:07.44
that the lobster traps and the lobster men

3196
02:54:07.44 --> 02:54:09.48
are not the problem.

3197
02:54:09.48 --> 02:54:13.20
So why are they not making this connection?

3198
02:54:13.20 --> 02:54:15.16
Why are they continue to go down this path

3199
02:54:15.16 --> 02:54:17.92
which there's evidence, clear evidence

3200
02:54:17.92 --> 02:54:19.32
that this isn't a problem?

3201
02:54:19.32 --> 02:54:23.64
Well, because you can't have windmills where you're lobstering

3202
02:54:23.64 --> 02:54:25.80
and they want to put windmills in those areas.

3203
02:54:25.80 --> 02:54:29.44
And hey, if they make sense, cool.

3204
02:54:29.44 --> 02:54:31.08
Right now they do not make sense

3205
02:54:31.08 --> 02:54:33.24
and you don't make up a lie, you know,

3206
02:54:33.24 --> 02:54:35.36
even if it's right, the windmills,

3207
02:54:35.36 --> 02:54:38.32
but you make up a lie to make it happen, that's wrong.

3208
02:54:38.32 --> 02:54:40.32
Wait, wait, wait, you're saying that the reason

3209
02:54:40.32 --> 02:54:41.60
that they want to do this is to,

3210
02:54:41.60 --> 02:54:43.52
because they can put windmills out there?

3211
02:54:43.52 --> 02:54:45.52
Can I say that 100% because,

3212
02:54:45.52 --> 02:54:48.76
but that's where they want to put them, you know.

3213
02:54:48.76 --> 02:54:52.56
Okay, so you're saying there is a plan to put windmills

3214
02:54:52.56 --> 02:54:54.08
out in that section of the ocean.

3215
02:54:54.08 --> 02:54:59.08
And it's the, they want to do it on the sea mounts,

3216
02:55:00.12 --> 02:55:00.96
the mountains in the sea

3217
02:55:00.96 --> 02:55:03.52
because that's where all the sea life goes

3218
02:55:03.52 --> 02:55:06.36
because you put the shortest chain on those.

3219
02:55:06.36 --> 02:55:11.36
These are three to one ratio chains, nine foot lengths,

3220
02:55:11.72 --> 02:55:16.20
and 50 fathoms, you know, I think it's 50 fathoms,

3221
02:55:16.20 --> 02:55:20.44
you know, 300 feet, and that's going to rake

3222
02:55:20.44 --> 02:55:23.60
and destroy the bottom and then they're going

3223
02:55:23.60 --> 02:55:25.18
to run horizontal lines.

3224
02:55:26.24 --> 02:55:27.08
You know.

3225
02:55:27.08 --> 02:55:27.92
To get the power back.

3226
02:55:27.92 --> 02:55:30.96
Yeah, to get, well, to string these things together.

3227
02:55:30.96 --> 02:55:34.44
And, you know, that'll catch a right whale

3228
02:55:34.44 --> 02:55:36.44
because they get caught in their mouth.

3229
02:55:36.44 --> 02:55:38.28
And all the pictures that they keep showing

3230
02:55:38.28 --> 02:55:40.28
of the right whale with entanglements,

3231
02:55:41.40 --> 02:55:46.000
you know, it's never been our lobster gear.

3232
02:55:46.000 --> 02:55:51.000
It's bigger braided line and not the problem.

3233
02:55:51.40 --> 02:55:55.68
You know, it's, yeah, you got to really look at it.

3234
02:55:55.68 --> 02:55:56.88
None of it makes sense.

3235
02:55:56.88 --> 02:55:58.28
You know, none of it makes sense

3236
02:55:58.28 --> 02:56:00.56
and no one's going back and saying,

3237
02:56:00.56 --> 02:56:03.22
hey, let's reassess this.

3238
02:56:03.22 --> 02:56:05.84
You know, it should have never gotten to this point.

3239
02:56:05.84 --> 02:56:08.76
They're looking to start and shut things down next month.

3240
02:56:08.76 --> 02:56:10.08
You know, hey, we're going to do a lawsuit.

3241
02:56:10.08 --> 02:56:12.92
Yeah, well, it's getting shut down.

3242
02:56:12.92 --> 02:56:14.12
Who's doing a lawsuit?

3243
02:56:14.12 --> 02:56:17.000
They're saying that the state's going to.

3244
02:56:18.44 --> 02:56:22.64
The lobsterman did one and took it to court.

3245
02:56:22.64 --> 02:56:27.64
And it's all the cryptic deaths.

3246
02:56:27.88 --> 02:56:30.36
And the, you know, we were us taking credit

3247
02:56:30.36 --> 02:56:31.20
for half of theirs.

3248
02:56:31.20 --> 02:56:36.20
They want a 90% reduction in deaths.

3249
02:56:36.32 --> 02:56:41.32
Yet windmills, you know, the new vineyard wind farm

3250
02:56:41.92 --> 02:56:43.64
down in mass.

3251
02:56:43.64 --> 02:56:46.84
They get to do 20 takes.

3252
02:56:46.84 --> 02:56:49.84
It's level B harassment, which is.

3253
02:56:49.84 --> 02:56:51.28
But what's 20 takes?

3254
02:56:51.28 --> 02:56:52.12
What does that mean?

3255
02:56:52.12 --> 02:56:53.88
Taking by level B harassment.

3256
02:56:53.88 --> 02:56:55.52
You can harass them.

3257
02:56:55.52 --> 02:57:00.52
And if it gets taken, you had permission to harass it.

3258
02:57:00.76 --> 02:57:03.44
So you can stop them from breathing, you know,

3259
02:57:03.44 --> 02:57:06.48
by not allowing them to come to surface.

3260
02:57:06.48 --> 02:57:08.32
You can stop them from mating.

3261
02:57:08.32 --> 02:57:10.24
You can stop them from sheltering.

3262
02:57:10.24 --> 02:57:13.56
You can disrupt their migratory path.

3263
02:57:14.76 --> 02:57:15.60
So.

3264
02:57:15.60 --> 02:57:17.32
You can do all that to the whales?

3265
02:57:17.32 --> 02:57:19.84
The windmills can.

3266
02:57:19.84 --> 02:57:21.80
Cause they're going to do some blasting.

3267
02:57:21.80 --> 02:57:24.24
They've got to do some sonic testing.

3268
02:57:24.24 --> 02:57:25.96
Just a vibration of the, you know,

3269
02:57:25.96 --> 02:57:28.16
what is the windmill itself going to do?

3270
02:57:29.16 --> 02:57:31.76
And if you multiply that times all the windmills

3271
02:57:31.76 --> 02:57:36.000
up and down the coast, that's more right whales

3272
02:57:36.000 --> 02:57:39.24
than are alive as they count them.

3273
02:57:39.24 --> 02:57:42.12
You know, so again, it doesn't make sense.

3274
02:57:42.12 --> 02:57:45.16
It's not about the lobster man, you know,

3275
02:57:45.16 --> 02:57:50.16
take a look at it and everybody jump on board, you know,

3276
02:57:50.44 --> 02:57:55.44
cause you know, they're, you know, it's so frustrating.

3277
02:57:56.08 --> 02:57:58.12
And you can look at me as crazy you want,

3278
02:57:58.12 --> 02:57:59.04
cause it's that crazy.

3279
02:57:59.04 --> 02:58:00.20
It doesn't make sense.

3280
02:58:00.20 --> 02:58:01.44
And it's moving forward.

3281
02:58:04.84 --> 02:58:05.68
Crazy.

3282
02:58:05.68 --> 02:58:06.68
That's why we're running.

3283
02:58:06.68 --> 02:58:07.52
Yeah.

3284
02:58:07.52 --> 02:58:10.32
Cause there's so much that, that, you know,

3285
02:58:10.32 --> 02:58:12.64
we just got to, and I don't know what I'm going to do.

3286
02:58:12.64 --> 02:58:14.68
You know, I know I'm going to butt heads

3287
02:58:14.68 --> 02:58:16.36
in my own party too.

3288
02:58:16.36 --> 02:58:18.08
Cause I'm that guy.

3289
02:58:18.08 --> 02:58:20.08
If it doesn't make sense, it doesn't make sense, you know,

3290
02:58:20.08 --> 02:58:22.72
and it's about the country, you know,

3291
02:58:22.72 --> 02:58:25.000
it's never about your platoon.

3292
02:58:25.000 --> 02:58:26.20
You're going to fight for your platoon,

3293
02:58:26.20 --> 02:58:27.80
your task unit, your team.

3294
02:58:27.80 --> 02:58:30.000
But in the end, you don't do anything.

3295
02:58:30.000 --> 02:58:33.44
That competitiveness in a platoon and task unit,

3296
02:58:33.44 --> 02:58:38.44
it never supersedes your, your task in the country.

3297
02:58:38.56 --> 02:58:41.36
You know, I love the competitiveness in a platoon.

3298
02:58:41.36 --> 02:58:43.04
You know, it's, it's awesome.

3299
02:58:43.04 --> 02:58:44.12
Cause you're all fighting.

3300
02:58:44.12 --> 02:58:46.52
You all want to be the, you know, when,

3301
02:58:46.52 --> 02:58:50.04
when the building's burning, you want to be, you know,

3302
02:58:50.04 --> 02:58:51.72
the squad that gets called to go in.

3303
02:58:51.72 --> 02:58:55.20
And you don't, you know, firemen don't want the fire,

3304
02:58:55.20 --> 02:58:57.16
but they're all, all the men are competing

3305
02:58:57.16 --> 02:58:59.48
so that they can be the guy on the team

3306
02:58:59.48 --> 02:59:02.16
that goes in and helps, right?

3307
02:59:02.16 --> 02:59:04.32
But you never let that competitiveness, you know,

3308
02:59:04.32 --> 02:59:07.40
it's like taking, you know, politicians are like taking

3309
02:59:07.40 --> 02:59:10.44
the firing pins out of, you know, the rifles

3310
02:59:10.44 --> 02:59:13.88
so that they, they, they look better than the other guy,

3311
02:59:13.88 --> 02:59:18.72
you know, you know, it's, it's, it's like a sales team,

3312
02:59:18.72 --> 02:59:21.76
you know, you know, cutting the cord to the copy machine

3313
02:59:21.76 --> 02:59:24.04
before the other sales team gets to print out their,

3314
02:59:24.04 --> 02:59:27.20
their briefs, you know, it's, that's the competitive

3315
02:59:27.20 --> 02:59:28.80
that's going on in politics.

3316
02:59:28.80 --> 02:59:32.64
It's, it's, I've got six years is what the,

3317
02:59:32.64 --> 02:59:36.36
what the family agreed to is to do this for six years.

3318
02:59:36.36 --> 02:59:38.24
And I believe in term limits, you know,

3319
02:59:38.24 --> 02:59:39.40
I will definitely self-impose

3320
02:59:39.40 --> 02:59:41.72
because I got an awesome life I want to get back to.

3321
02:59:41.72 --> 02:59:46.000
And that's what, you've got an objective

3322
02:59:46.000 --> 02:59:49.24
and when you, when you transfer to one command to the next,

3323
02:59:49.24 --> 02:59:51.36
you know, you've got a limited time there

3324
02:59:51.36 --> 02:59:53.76
and you're going to take that piece of string

3325
02:59:53.76 --> 02:59:55.76
and you're going to pass it off as a rappel line

3326
02:59:55.76 --> 02:59:57.92
and then pass it off as a howler's line.

3327
02:59:57.92 --> 03:00:00.96
And, you know, you're going to have an objective

3328
03:00:00.96 --> 03:00:03.92
at the end of that time that you're going to be successful.

3329
03:00:03.92 --> 03:00:06.36
You're going to have made America better.

3330
03:00:06.36 --> 03:00:08.92
And that's not happening.

3331
03:00:08.92 --> 03:00:10.44
It's a whole bunch of politicking

3332
03:00:10.44 --> 03:00:13.56
and a whole bunch of saber rattling to get the next,

3333
03:00:14.60 --> 03:00:18.44
you know, election, you know, spun up, fund,

3334
03:00:18.44 --> 03:00:20.24
you know, funded and everything else.

3335
03:00:21.16 --> 03:00:25.000
Yeah, finding that common ground and getting it done.

3336
03:00:25.000 --> 03:00:27.12
If they weren't so worried about getting their next,

3337
03:00:27.12 --> 03:00:30.92
you know, seat in Congress, the next term set up,

3338
03:00:30.92 --> 03:00:32.52
they probably wouldn't be spending money

3339
03:00:32.52 --> 03:00:34.80
and sprinkling it all over the place, you know,

3340
03:00:34.80 --> 03:00:36.68
making people happy with a little bit of money here,

3341
03:00:36.68 --> 03:00:37.96
a little bit of money there.

3342
03:00:37.96 --> 03:00:41.04
Hey, you know, this party's trying to do that to you

3343
03:00:41.04 --> 03:00:43.64
and that party's trying to do this to you,

3344
03:00:43.64 --> 03:00:46.000
you know, when that's not true, you know,

3345
03:00:47.28 --> 03:00:51.08
definitely these hot button topics.

3346
03:00:51.08 --> 03:00:54.28
You look at the mailers that come in, you know,

3347
03:00:54.28 --> 03:00:58.52
where they're teaching hate, you know.

3348
03:00:58.52 --> 03:01:02.24
And these are like mailers for different candidates

3349
03:01:02.24 --> 03:01:03.08
up in Maine.

3350
03:01:03.08 --> 03:01:05.12
Yeah, in Maine, everywhere.

3351
03:01:05.12 --> 03:01:07.28
You know, you know, the,

3352
03:01:09.24 --> 03:01:10.52
even broach the subject,

3353
03:01:10.52 --> 03:01:14.88
because it's, you get demonized, you know, abortion, you know.

3354
03:01:14.88 --> 03:01:16.24
One side thinks it's a baby,

3355
03:01:16.24 --> 03:01:18.48
the other side thinks it's a woman's right.

3356
03:01:18.48 --> 03:01:23.48
And basically that topic is either side thinks the other person's

3357
03:01:24.92 --> 03:01:28.56
completely evil and that's not the case.

3358
03:01:28.56 --> 03:01:31.32
Each side was taught something different, you know,

3359
03:01:32.52 --> 03:01:34.24
you know, Republican women don't wanna take away

3360
03:01:34.24 --> 03:01:37.12
women's rights, they're strong Republican women.

3361
03:01:37.12 --> 03:01:39.60
And they're strong, they believe in women's rights,

3362
03:01:39.60 --> 03:01:42.52
but they also believe it's a baby, you know.

3363
03:01:42.52 --> 03:01:47.52
And on the other side, they were taught something different.

3364
03:01:47.52 --> 03:01:51.000
And people are trying to make laws right now,

3365
03:01:51.000 --> 03:01:52.88
they're saying they want to,

3366
03:01:52.88 --> 03:01:57.88
but it's not legal to make a law federally about it

3367
03:01:58.20 --> 03:01:59.96
because it just got, it has to go back

3368
03:01:59.96 --> 03:02:01.44
through the Supreme Court.

3369
03:02:01.44 --> 03:02:06.12
And both sides are saying the other side's gonna do something

3370
03:02:06.12 --> 03:02:07.64
evil to your side.

3371
03:02:07.64 --> 03:02:09.32
Well, no, you actually can't.

3372
03:02:09.32 --> 03:02:11.36
So why are you campaigning on it?

3373
03:02:11.36 --> 03:02:14.96
You know, and that's, I get,

3374
03:02:14.96 --> 03:02:19.96
you will, this conversation is older, over, done.

3375
03:02:20.56 --> 03:02:23.76
When I say, you know, my stance on it in pro life,

3376
03:02:23.76 --> 03:02:26.76
but I will not legislate on it.

3377
03:02:26.76 --> 03:02:29.16
I'll vote no, either way, it comes to me.

3378
03:02:29.16 --> 03:02:32.76
You know, it's, I mean, saying this on air right now

3379
03:02:32.76 --> 03:02:34.16
is crazy questionable

3380
03:02:34.16 --> 03:02:36.44
because some people that will just shut down,

3381
03:02:37.72 --> 03:02:41.48
shut down both sides, you know,

3382
03:02:41.48 --> 03:02:45.04
because the people think I should take my position

3383
03:02:45.04 --> 03:02:47.40
and use it to what they want, you know?

3384
03:02:48.28 --> 03:02:50.36
But that's not constitutional.

3385
03:02:50.36 --> 03:02:52.80
So your statement pisses everyone off.

3386
03:02:52.80 --> 03:02:54.04
Yeah, yeah.

3387
03:02:54.04 --> 03:02:56.08
So you got that going for you at the lender.

3388
03:02:56.08 --> 03:02:58.44
But you know what, I'm honest about it.

3389
03:02:58.44 --> 03:03:01.000
And it's not constitutive, it belongs at the state.

3390
03:03:01.000 --> 03:03:02.32
That's how the country gets along

3391
03:03:02.32 --> 03:03:04.56
is we have all these little countries

3392
03:03:04.56 --> 03:03:07.12
that unified and became a federal republic.

3393
03:03:07.12 --> 03:03:10.20
And, you know, there's different laws

3394
03:03:10.20 --> 03:03:14.92
in Massachusetts and California and Maine

3395
03:03:14.92 --> 03:03:18.64
and the people vote on them, the representatives,

3396
03:03:18.64 --> 03:03:20.52
you know, represent them.

3397
03:03:20.52 --> 03:03:22.64
And that's how we get along.

3398
03:03:22.64 --> 03:03:25.40
Otherwise we would tear ourselves apart a long time ago.

3399
03:03:25.40 --> 03:03:29.04
You know, and, you know, we're not going back to the 60s.

3400
03:03:29.04 --> 03:03:31.88
You know, segregation, we're not, you know?

3401
03:03:31.88 --> 03:03:34.88
That gets, I get so much gets thrown at me.

3402
03:03:34.88 --> 03:03:37.72
And I'm just gonna be honest, you know?

3403
03:03:37.72 --> 03:03:42.12
And it's that hate, and I mean it's hate.

3404
03:03:43.16 --> 03:03:48.16
They're accusing one side or the other of, you know,

3405
03:03:50.40 --> 03:03:52.04
taking away women's rights.

3406
03:03:52.04 --> 03:03:54.08
The other side just thinks it's a baby.

3407
03:03:54.08 --> 03:03:55.56
Everybody knows it's life.

3408
03:03:56.56 --> 03:03:58.16
It's just when it's become human life.

3409
03:03:58.16 --> 03:04:00.84
And we go so far left and right of it, you know?

3410
03:04:02.72 --> 03:04:04.40
There's only three countries in the world

3411
03:04:04.40 --> 03:04:09.48
that have late-term abortion, you know?

3412
03:04:09.48 --> 03:04:12.96
China, North Korea, and America.

3413
03:04:12.96 --> 03:04:15.20
And again, I don't care where anybody stands at.

3414
03:04:15.20 --> 03:04:17.96
I don't hate anybody for their thought on it.

3415
03:04:17.96 --> 03:04:20.60
I know that people have been taught different about it.

3416
03:04:20.60 --> 03:04:23.12
You know, so I have no idea

3417
03:04:23.12 --> 03:04:25.92
if we should be going down this route.

3418
03:04:25.92 --> 03:04:30.28
Honestly, uh-uh, because it, it's crazy.

3419
03:04:31.92 --> 03:04:33.84
I've been doing my lobster boat swims.

3420
03:04:33.84 --> 03:04:35.000
Did I tell you about those?

3421
03:04:35.000 --> 03:04:36.68
No, tell me about your lobster boat swims.

3422
03:04:36.68 --> 03:04:38.40
My lobster boat swims.

3423
03:04:38.40 --> 03:04:41.52
So I'm swimming, you know, they have the Lop,

3424
03:04:41.52 --> 03:04:43.72
they had a rally, a concert on the water,

3425
03:04:43.72 --> 03:04:45.48
all the lobsters come around.

3426
03:04:45.48 --> 03:04:50.48
And 60 degree water, and I got my campaign material

3427
03:04:51.24 --> 03:04:53.16
in a dry bag.

3428
03:04:53.16 --> 03:04:55.56
And I'm swimming boat to boat, skinning it.

3429
03:04:55.56 --> 03:04:57.16
And I'm, hey, I'm Ed Thielander,

3430
03:04:57.16 --> 03:04:58.96
retired Navy SEAL, running for U.S. Congress.

3431
03:04:58.96 --> 03:05:01.52
Mind if I come on board and tell you about the campaign?

3432
03:05:01.52 --> 03:05:04.000
I hit 50 boats one day, like three and a half, four hours

3433
03:05:04.000 --> 03:05:05.000
in the water.

3434
03:05:05.000 --> 03:05:06.88
I did it five times.

3435
03:05:06.88 --> 03:05:08.96
Swimming with the sharks.

3436
03:05:08.96 --> 03:05:12.96
And, uh, and Harpswell, the great whites are out

3437
03:05:12.96 --> 03:05:14.96
tearing SEALs apart, not this one.

3438
03:05:16.56 --> 03:05:20.12
And, you know, I'm campaigning boat to boat again.

3439
03:05:20.12 --> 03:05:23.20
And, you know, it's just neat getting a lot of love.

3440
03:05:24.48 --> 03:05:29.16
And, yeah, hit the news guy.

3441
03:05:29.16 --> 03:05:30.56
He's on the float.

3442
03:05:30.56 --> 03:05:33.08
And, uh, I won't say what channel.

3443
03:05:33.08 --> 03:05:34.52
I really want to.

3444
03:05:34.52 --> 03:05:38.16
But, uh, you go, hey, I'm Ed, you know?

3445
03:05:38.16 --> 03:05:40.60
And, uh, yeah, I know who you are.

3446
03:05:40.60 --> 03:05:42.56
Hey, great, I said, you know,

3447
03:05:42.56 --> 03:05:44.56
be great to get on camera.

3448
03:05:44.56 --> 03:05:47.28
No, I won't cover you.

3449
03:05:47.28 --> 03:05:49.80
You know, that's a crazy wild thing, too.

3450
03:05:49.80 --> 03:05:52.80
You know, it never has that been done before.

3451
03:05:52.80 --> 03:05:56.04
And, uh, pretty disappointing.

3452
03:05:56.04 --> 03:05:58.84
You know, that's, yeah, that's another crazy disappointing

3453
03:05:58.84 --> 03:06:03.12
thing is, uh, that, that slant on it is pretty tough.

3454
03:06:03.12 --> 03:06:05.84
Well, that's a good way for people to keep their

3455
03:06:05.84 --> 03:06:10.20
intellectual, media, uh, loop closed.

3456
03:06:10.20 --> 03:06:11.04
Yeah. Yeah.

3457
03:06:11.04 --> 03:06:12.32
Well, I'm just not going to put you on.

3458
03:06:12.32 --> 03:06:13.16
Right.

3459
03:06:13.16 --> 03:06:14.000
That's that.

3460
03:06:14.000 --> 03:06:15.000
Not going to let anyone form their opinions about you

3461
03:06:15.000 --> 03:06:16.92
because they're not going to know who you are.

3462
03:06:16.92 --> 03:06:17.96
Craziness.

3463
03:06:17.96 --> 03:06:18.80
Oh, yeah.

3464
03:06:18.80 --> 03:06:19.64
Craziness.

3465
03:06:20.84 --> 03:06:23.44
So, I mean, it seems like that gets us to present day.

3466
03:06:23.44 --> 03:06:24.84
We caught up right now.

3467
03:06:24.84 --> 03:06:25.68
Pretty caught up.

3468
03:06:25.68 --> 03:06:26.52
Yeah.

3469
03:06:26.52 --> 03:06:27.34
Yeah.

3470
03:06:27.34 --> 03:06:28.18
We're, uh, running hard.

3471
03:06:28.18 --> 03:06:31.88
We're, we're, uh, it's, uh, you know, I hit three, four

3472
03:06:31.88 --> 03:06:34.24
events in a day, you know, I mean, I hit three events,

3473
03:06:34.24 --> 03:06:37.20
four events before I had my debate the other day, you

3474
03:06:37.20 --> 03:06:39.28
know, just because I got to get the name out there.

3475
03:06:39.28 --> 03:06:42.72
And we're, you know, uh, we're everywhere all the time.

3476
03:06:42.72 --> 03:06:45.92
Uh, you know, wife included, you know, a kid or two once

3477
03:06:45.92 --> 03:06:49.32
in a while and, uh, just driving hard, you know, and

3478
03:06:49.32 --> 03:06:52.04
seeing, uh, what, what comes up.

3479
03:06:52.04 --> 03:06:54.08
And you're down to the wire right now, huh?

3480
03:06:54.08 --> 03:06:55.24
Yeah. We're down to the wire.

3481
03:06:55.24 --> 03:06:58.52
Uh, got another forum or debate on Wednesday as a

3482
03:06:58.52 --> 03:07:01.36
forum, I guess, they haven't given us the format yet.

3483
03:07:01.36 --> 03:07:05.16
Uh, so that's coming, you know, that there's a, uh, a

3484
03:07:05.16 --> 03:07:08.56
third party candidate that just jumped in September 9th.

3485
03:07:08.56 --> 03:07:10.04
Kind of can't figure that out yet.

3486
03:07:10.04 --> 03:07:13.96
He's a right in candidate that activates rank choice voting.

3487
03:07:13.96 --> 03:07:18.44
Um, so yeah, just vote Ed Thielander right across all

3488
03:07:18.44 --> 03:07:19.76
three slots.

3489
03:07:19.76 --> 03:07:22.44
Um, he's the love party.

3490
03:07:22.44 --> 03:07:25.000
Love over violent empire.

3491
03:07:25.000 --> 03:07:26.60
Well, I did say I love whales.

3492
03:07:26.60 --> 03:07:28.84
Maybe I'm part of his thing.

3493
03:07:28.84 --> 03:07:29.68
Yeah.

3494
03:07:29.68 --> 03:07:30.72
It's rank choice.

3495
03:07:30.72 --> 03:07:32.16
It's another crazy thing.

3496
03:07:32.16 --> 03:07:33.08
What's rank choice?

3497
03:07:33.08 --> 03:07:35.92
What do you, so you can put him in order of rank.

3498
03:07:35.92 --> 03:07:36.76
Yeah.

3499
03:07:36.76 --> 03:07:38.12
The top person gets three points or whatever.

3500
03:07:38.12 --> 03:07:43.12
So if, if, uh, if I don't win by 51%, you know, over 50%,

3501
03:07:46.56 --> 03:07:48.92
then it goes by rank choice.

3502
03:07:48.92 --> 03:07:52.28
So, you know, you choose one, two, and three, or you can

3503
03:07:52.28 --> 03:07:56.32
just do one across for, for one candidate and kind of your

3504
03:07:56.32 --> 03:07:59.68
bad, well, it's, you know, uh, doesn't give any points to

3505
03:07:59.68 --> 03:08:00.52
the other people.

3506
03:08:00.52 --> 03:08:02.36
How are the polls right now?

3507
03:08:02.36 --> 03:08:07.44
The polls, uh, you know, the legit poll we have, uh, is

3508
03:08:07.44 --> 03:08:10.92
that we're out raising her three to one in main individual

3509
03:08:10.92 --> 03:08:12.52
people, human donations.

3510
03:08:12.52 --> 03:08:13.36
Okay.

3511
03:08:13.36 --> 03:08:14.20
That's a good sign.

3512
03:08:14.20 --> 03:08:15.56
The other ones is generic.

3513
03:08:15.56 --> 03:08:19.92
Uh, and it doesn't really take an account me cause I'm, I'm

3514
03:08:19.92 --> 03:08:22.24
still very unknown, even though we've been doing it for 14

3515
03:08:22.24 --> 03:08:23.08
months.

3516
03:08:23.08 --> 03:08:23.90
It's amazing.

3517
03:08:23.90 --> 03:08:26.24
You know, there's, you know, uh, districts, you know,

3518
03:08:26.24 --> 03:08:28.36
three quarters of a million people, main smaller being

3519
03:08:28.36 --> 03:08:31.52
there's six, it's 680 plus thousand, you know, can't

3520
03:08:31.52 --> 03:08:33.32
reach all those folks.

3521
03:08:33.32 --> 03:08:34.32
So we're out there.

3522
03:08:34.32 --> 03:08:37.28
We're, we're in the places that, that Republicans don't

3523
03:08:37.28 --> 03:08:40.24
dare to tread cause, you know, they're coming on board.

3524
03:08:40.24 --> 03:08:43.76
Um, you know, our first max donor was a far left Democrat

3525
03:08:43.76 --> 03:08:48.40
and Democrats signing up, uh, um, to help us out.

3526
03:08:48.40 --> 03:08:50.16
The don't, why do you think that is?

3527
03:08:50.16 --> 03:08:52.16
Why do you think Democrats are signing up to help you out

3528
03:08:52.16 --> 03:08:53.16
as a Republican?

3529
03:08:53.16 --> 03:08:55.20
Cause people are tired of what's going on.

3530
03:08:55.20 --> 03:08:57.32
Uh, they, they want to see change.

3531
03:08:57.32 --> 03:08:59.76
There's, you know, tired and scared for the winter.

3532
03:08:59.76 --> 03:09:03.000
You know, Maine is, uh, uh, we heat.

3533
03:09:03.000 --> 03:09:04.92
The fuel prices is going to be crazy.

3534
03:09:04.92 --> 03:09:05.92
Yeah.

3535
03:09:05.92 --> 03:09:10.68
60% of people in Maine heat with oil and it's over double,

3536
03:09:10.68 --> 03:09:14.80
almost triple what it was, uh, last year, uh, and, and

3537
03:09:14.80 --> 03:09:18.68
going up, you know, um, that's going to people are really

3538
03:09:18.68 --> 03:09:20.80
going to choose between heat and heat.

3539
03:09:20.80 --> 03:09:24.64
Um, and they were making that choice, uh, before, you know,

3540
03:09:24.64 --> 03:09:27.64
uh, it's, it's going to be a very tough winter.

3541
03:09:27.64 --> 03:09:30.64
Um, people don't want to be dependent on the government,

3542
03:09:30.64 --> 03:09:32.96
but it's kind of being forced on them right now.

3543
03:09:32.96 --> 03:09:33.96
And that's wrong.

3544
03:09:33.96 --> 03:09:37.20
We want the Republicans, we want folks to be successful on

3545
03:09:37.20 --> 03:09:38.20
the run.

3546
03:09:38.20 --> 03:09:42.44
We help out, um, but man, it's, uh, it's opportunity and

3547
03:09:42.44 --> 03:09:46.72
freedom, you know, uh, and responsibility and, uh, people

3548
03:09:46.72 --> 03:09:47.72
want that.

3549
03:09:47.72 --> 03:09:51.000
Maine is, you know, very independent.

3550
03:09:51.000 --> 03:09:56.24
Uh, it's, uh, a ton of the voters, most of, uh, of large

3551
03:09:56.24 --> 03:09:57.92
in the state are independent.

3552
03:09:57.92 --> 03:10:02.20
Um, and, uh, they just want to be left alone and, and, uh,

3553
03:10:02.20 --> 03:10:04.96
you know, nobody wants to pay taxes, but they do and, and,

3554
03:10:04.96 --> 03:10:05.96
and they want to work.

3555
03:10:05.96 --> 03:10:06.96
Yeah.

3556
03:10:06.96 --> 03:10:07.96
I don't get people working again.

3557
03:10:07.96 --> 03:10:10.40
It's what they want to, uh, a lot of things have been

3558
03:10:10.40 --> 03:10:13.96
shut down and, and, uh, yeah, it's hard to find workers.

3559
03:10:13.96 --> 03:10:17.20
You're experiencing that, you know, um, working on that.

3560
03:10:17.20 --> 03:10:21.60
And some folks that, uh, been signing up for, uh, some training

3561
03:10:21.60 --> 03:10:23.80
by Ashel on front and a couple of folks going to the

3562
03:10:23.80 --> 03:10:27.52
musters, uh, as I'm, you know, going to the, uh, um, these

3563
03:10:27.52 --> 03:10:31.20
job fairs, you know, talking to the, the, not only the

3564
03:10:31.20 --> 03:10:33.60
students that they're going to some of these high school,

3565
03:10:33.60 --> 03:10:38.20
uh, job fairs, but the employers too, you know, um, and I,

3566
03:10:38.20 --> 03:10:42.84
I mentioned earlier, uh, uh, the camp was rolling, but, uh,

3567
03:10:42.84 --> 03:10:46.72
yeah, the, uh, the Republican national committee, um, the

3568
03:10:46.72 --> 03:10:53.04
executive director, uh, issues, uh, the field manual for

3569
03:10:53.04 --> 03:10:56.12
discipline equals freedom to everybody that comes on board.

3570
03:10:56.12 --> 03:10:57.64
Uh, pretty wild.

3571
03:10:57.64 --> 03:10:58.64
Yeah.

3572
03:10:58.64 --> 03:11:01.24
It's, uh, but yeah, people are tired.

3573
03:11:01.24 --> 03:11:04.28
People are scared and, uh, you know, what's in power right now

3574
03:11:04.28 --> 03:11:08.60
is influencing that, you know, whatever side you're on, uh,

3575
03:11:08.60 --> 03:11:11.44
it's, uh, it's, it's time to make them change.

3576
03:11:11.44 --> 03:11:14.04
If you want change, because you can't keep doing the same

3577
03:11:14.04 --> 03:11:15.60
thing, things aren't going right.

3578
03:11:15.60 --> 03:11:20.44
You got to vote it in and, uh, yeah, you know, uh, I do reach

3579
03:11:20.44 --> 03:11:24.56
across the aisle, you know, and, uh, you know, I'm, you're,

3580
03:11:24.56 --> 03:11:28.28
you're typical Republican, uh, conservative, you know, doesn't

3581
03:11:28.28 --> 03:11:29.28
have purple hair.

3582
03:11:29.28 --> 03:11:32.56
I talked to them, get ton of love off of everybody, you know,

3583
03:11:32.56 --> 03:11:34.52
uh, tattoos up to the eyeballs.

3584
03:11:34.52 --> 03:11:37.76
I don't, you know, I'm happy to talk to anybody, you know,

3585
03:11:37.76 --> 03:11:42.56
um, you know, cannabis, you know, uh, folks, uh, medically,

3586
03:11:42.56 --> 03:11:45.52
you know, so on board with it, recreationally, it's legal and

3587
03:11:45.52 --> 03:11:49.04
main, let's tax it and move forward and, and, uh, protect

3588
03:11:49.04 --> 03:11:51.80
the, the end, it's, it's, you know, those folks are still

3589
03:11:51.80 --> 03:11:55.88
buying stuff, uh, and, uh, you know, Republicans aren't

3590
03:11:55.88 --> 03:11:56.88
normally about that.

3591
03:11:56.88 --> 03:11:59.28
Now I'm stepping on the over the line telling everybody

3592
03:11:59.28 --> 03:12:03.32
right now I am, uh, and that's not, you know, the Republican

3593
03:12:03.32 --> 03:12:04.32
standard.

3594
03:12:04.32 --> 03:12:09.12
Uh, I'm willing to say, hey, you know, uh, yeah, I wasn't,

3595
03:12:09.12 --> 03:12:12.28
I've never tried it, you know, I'm, I'm, you know, I'm not a

3596
03:12:12.28 --> 03:12:14.24
heavy drinker, not never tried any of that.

3597
03:12:14.24 --> 03:12:18.40
Uh, but medically, I know it's helped so many people.

3598
03:12:18.40 --> 03:12:22.16
Um, and, uh, you know, prescribing an 11 year old

3599
03:12:22.16 --> 03:12:24.76
Adderall, not a good plan.

3600
03:12:24.76 --> 03:12:27.04
Uh, you know, there's other alternatives out there are not

3601
03:12:27.04 --> 03:12:29.40
addictive that, that can keep them focusing straight.

3602
03:12:29.40 --> 03:12:32.44
And, uh, we've got to be so much smarter about that.

3603
03:12:32.44 --> 03:12:35.92
So you, so you have different viewpoints from the standard

3604
03:12:35.92 --> 03:12:37.96
and you got an open mind thinking about what makes sense to

3605
03:12:37.96 --> 03:12:40.68
you and not what the party line is.

3606
03:12:40.68 --> 03:12:41.68
Yeah.

3607
03:12:41.68 --> 03:12:43.36
Uh, it's, it's, that's very scary.

3608
03:12:43.36 --> 03:12:44.36
Yeah.

3609
03:12:44.36 --> 03:12:48.24
It's, it's the way I've lived my life.

3610
03:12:48.24 --> 03:12:50.60
That's how I got where I'm at, you know, uh, that's how I've

3611
03:12:50.60 --> 03:12:54.28
got along, you know, from, from childhood to now.

3612
03:12:54.28 --> 03:12:56.64
And, uh, that's what America needs.

3613
03:12:56.64 --> 03:12:58.88
I need somebody that's going to problem solve and get along

3614
03:12:58.88 --> 03:13:02.72
and, and say, Hey, you know, um, I made a mistake there.

3615
03:13:02.72 --> 03:13:04.64
Uh, let's move forward.

3616
03:13:04.64 --> 03:13:08.96
You know, and, uh, can't, you can't not, you know, the

3617
03:13:08.96 --> 03:13:13.32
Oodle-oop, you know, uh, for anybody want to explain that.

3618
03:13:13.32 --> 03:13:18.16
Observe or orient yourself, decide and act.

3619
03:13:18.16 --> 03:13:19.64
And then back to the beginning.

3620
03:13:19.64 --> 03:13:21.16
Don't just keep moving forward.

3621
03:13:21.16 --> 03:13:25.20
You know, small incremental decisions, you know, uh, and, uh,

3622
03:13:25.20 --> 03:13:31.44
yeah, but if you don't admit you've even two to 2% or 100%

3623
03:13:31.44 --> 03:13:34.96
got it wrong, uh, you're never going to improve and, you know,

3624
03:13:34.96 --> 03:13:38.52
do what we did in the SEAL teams and make such an awesome machine.

3625
03:13:38.52 --> 03:13:42.84
Our debriefs in the SEAL teams are brutal, brutal.

3626
03:13:42.84 --> 03:13:46.72
Uh, and, uh, they don't do that.

3627
03:13:46.72 --> 03:13:49.76
You know, uh, well, I'm going to do that.

3628
03:13:49.76 --> 03:13:52.28
You know, uh, I'm concerned to be in my own party, you know,

3629
03:13:52.28 --> 03:13:56.20
uh, uh, that I'm going to get along on a lot of things.

3630
03:13:56.20 --> 03:14:00.24
We'll see, you know, um, you know, and everything I say, um,

3631
03:14:00.24 --> 03:14:04.60
I'm willing to, yeah, check it out and see where, where it really is.

3632
03:14:04.60 --> 03:14:08.12
Um, and I've tucked on subjects that, that, uh, in this podcast

3633
03:14:08.12 --> 03:14:13.12
that, meh, you know, uh, people are going to say, you know, crazy wackadoodle dude.

3634
03:14:13.12 --> 03:14:14.04
Hey, you know what?

3635
03:14:14.04 --> 03:14:18.40
I'm still willing to look at it and, uh, make a decision, uh,

3636
03:14:18.40 --> 03:14:21.20
maybe say I was wrong and, and move forward.

3637
03:14:21.20 --> 03:14:23.96
Can't do it otherwise.

3638
03:14:23.96 --> 03:14:25.80
Well, it's a refreshing attitude to hear.

3639
03:14:25.80 --> 03:14:28.48
Where, where can people, if people want to support you?

Echo, what do you got for questions?

3655
03:15:02.16 --> 03:15:02.68
I have none.

3656
03:15:02.96 --> 03:15:03.96
No questions.

3657
03:15:03.96 --> 03:15:07.40
How about the, actually, you know, I'm a massive, so you, uh,

3658
03:15:07.76 --> 03:15:08.92
Come on, he needs practice.

3659
03:15:08.92 --> 03:15:10.16
He's got a debate coming up.

3660
03:15:10.16 --> 03:15:11.20
So you're gluten free then.

3661
03:15:11.80 --> 03:15:12.20
Yeah.

3662
03:15:12.28 --> 03:15:13.92
I'm a gluten free keto kook.

3663
03:15:13.92 --> 03:15:15.28
Wait, do you have celiacs?

3664
03:15:15.40 --> 03:15:17.16
Because you were having celiac symptoms.

3665
03:15:17.16 --> 03:15:18.68
So I got tested for celiacs.

3666
03:15:18.72 --> 03:15:22.000
Uh, and no, um, not celiacs.

3667
03:15:22.12 --> 03:15:22.44
Yeah.

3668
03:15:22.96 --> 03:15:24.24
Just gluten intolerance.

3669
03:15:24.24 --> 03:15:25.08
Gluten intolerance.

3670
03:15:25.08 --> 03:15:27.72
And now I'm a keto kook and, uh, yeah.

3671
03:15:27.72 --> 03:15:29.08
When did you get on the keto program?

3672
03:15:29.52 --> 03:15:30.92
Right about four years ago now.

3673
03:15:31.28 --> 03:15:32.72
And, and you love it.

3674
03:15:32.96 --> 03:15:33.36
Love it.

3675
03:15:33.36 --> 03:15:34.64
You know, feeling great.

3676
03:15:34.76 --> 03:15:35.80
I mean, everything's clear.

3677
03:15:35.80 --> 03:15:36.60
Brain's clear.

3678
03:15:36.68 --> 03:15:37.64
Joints are better.

3679
03:15:38.000 --> 03:15:41.60
You know, uh, how long did it take you to lose 70 pounds?

3680
03:15:42.24 --> 03:15:48.88
Um, well, first 25 was, uh, when I went gluten free, another 50 ish, um,

3681
03:15:48.92 --> 03:15:55.84
was when I went keto and that was, yeah, within a year and a half easy, uh, year.

3682
03:15:56.12 --> 03:15:57.96
I mean, I just, it just came right off.

3683
03:15:58.04 --> 03:15:59.60
And now you stay at 205.

3684
03:15:59.68 --> 03:16:01.40
I can go down if I want to.

3685
03:16:01.56 --> 03:16:02.44
Um, easy.

3686
03:16:02.44 --> 03:16:05.16
Um, I just don't want to buy any more suits.

3687
03:16:10.12 --> 03:16:10.84
Right on.

3688
03:16:10.84 --> 03:16:11.60
That's all I got.

3689
03:16:11.64 --> 03:16:11.92
Yeah.

3690
03:16:11.92 --> 03:16:13.32
I got a couple of pictures in my suit.

3691
03:16:13.36 --> 03:16:16.92
Uh, uh, the, the white collared shirt I got.

3692
03:16:17.40 --> 03:16:17.68
Yeah.

3693
03:16:17.68 --> 03:16:19.000
It looks like your dad's shirt.

3694
03:16:21.48 --> 03:16:22.000
Right on.

3695
03:16:22.000 --> 03:16:23.96
They had any closing thoughts before we shut it down.

3696
03:16:24.08 --> 03:16:24.36
No.

3697
03:16:24.36 --> 03:16:26.08
Hey, um, hey, thanks for having me on.

3698
03:16:26.08 --> 03:16:26.60
It's awesome.

3699
03:16:26.60 --> 03:16:30.12
It's awesome to be able to get the word out, you know, and, uh, hey, find that

3700
03:16:30.12 --> 03:16:30.88
common ground.

3701
03:16:30.88 --> 03:16:35.44
Let's move forward and, uh, let's make, you know, uh, the best of, of, of our

3702
03:16:35.44 --> 03:16:38.72
friendships and, uh, yeah, we will make things right.

3703
03:16:38.84 --> 03:16:39.24
Thank you.

3704
03:16:39.56 --> 03:16:39.84
Yeah.

3705
03:16:39.84 --> 03:16:40.76
Appreciate you coming on.

3706
03:16:40.76 --> 03:16:42.08
Obviously thanks for coming out.

3707
03:16:42.36 --> 03:16:45.40
Uh, thanks your service to the country, to the teams.

3708
03:16:46.24 --> 03:16:50.64
Thank you for jumping into this mayhem that you're jumping into now.

3709
03:16:51.04 --> 03:16:53.52
And, uh, I wish you luck in the political arena.

3710
03:16:53.56 --> 03:16:57.04
I just, the fact that you can come on here and, and explain that you have

3711
03:16:57.04 --> 03:17:01.44
different viewpoints than maybe one side or the other side and you agree with

3712
03:17:01.44 --> 03:17:03.12
some and you agree, disagree with others.

3713
03:17:04.16 --> 03:17:05.08
That's an open mind.

3714
03:17:05.40 --> 03:17:08.96
And for me, I think that's what it's going to take to get our country moving

3715
03:17:08.96 --> 03:17:09.92
in the right direction.

3716
03:17:09.96 --> 03:17:11.04
So thanks for what you're doing, bro.

3717
03:17:11.04 --> 03:17:11.80
And thanks for coming on.

3718
03:17:11.92 --> 03:17:12.48
Hey, thank you.

3719
03:17:12.48 --> 03:17:13.12
I appreciate it.

3720
03:17:13.16 --> 03:17:13.52
Thank you.

3721
03:17:15.28 --> 03:17:19.04
And with that, Ed D Lander has left the building.

3722
03:17:20.08 --> 03:17:20.88
Echo Charles.

3723
03:17:22.08 --> 03:17:25.08
Are you happy you're not running for political office right now?

3724
03:17:25.12 --> 03:17:25.40
Yes.

3725
03:17:25.40 --> 03:17:27.80
Currently, I am currently happy that I'm not currently running.

3726
03:17:27.80 --> 03:17:32.60
You kind of had a look on your face during portions of that, um, recording

3727
03:17:32.72 --> 03:17:35.76
that you were kind of happy that you weren't running for.

3728
03:17:36.76 --> 03:17:40.68
Yeah, we were, um, talking beforehand and you know, you want, when you get

3729
03:17:40.68 --> 03:17:42.56
into that arena, this is what I gathered.

3730
03:17:42.56 --> 03:17:45.24
When you get into that arena, you see the curtain kind of gets pulled back

3731
03:17:45.24 --> 03:17:46.72
and you see kind of how things work.

3732
03:17:47.08 --> 03:17:50.20
And then you, so essentially you have a problem in there where it's like, Hey,

3733
03:17:50.20 --> 03:17:51.40
we need to change this.

3734
03:17:51.76 --> 03:17:52.64
How are we going to change that?

3735
03:17:52.64 --> 03:17:55.20
Well, you know, this system is set up to allow this.

3736
03:17:55.20 --> 03:17:57.84
Not necessarily for this, but it kind of allows for this.

3737
03:17:57.84 --> 03:17:58.28
Well, okay.

3738
03:17:58.32 --> 03:17:59.64
We'll change that then.

3739
03:18:00.12 --> 03:18:03.80
Oh, well, but that system has to be voted on by the people who are benefiting

3740
03:18:03.80 --> 03:18:05.76
from that system that allows this.

3741
03:18:06.48 --> 03:18:08.32
And it's like, oh man, so okay, what do you got to do then?

3742
03:18:08.32 --> 03:18:09.000
Then you got to do this.

3743
03:18:09.000 --> 03:18:15.08
And you got to, and it's like this big, like unraveling of a thing with like

3744
03:18:15.08 --> 03:18:16.68
so many unintended consequences.

3745
03:18:16.68 --> 03:18:18.92
And it's like, man, it goes deep.

3746
03:18:19.08 --> 03:18:22.12
And then that's, that's on top of like the obvious stuff.

3747
03:18:22.64 --> 03:18:24.96
I was like, wow, man, I'm glad you're running and not

3748
03:18:24.96 --> 03:18:25.52
me right now.

3749
03:18:27.76 --> 03:18:28.72
Well, good on him.

3750
03:18:28.84 --> 03:18:30.24
I'm glad we could get him out here.

3751
03:18:31.24 --> 03:18:34.92
Because, you know, he's, he's making an effort.

3752
03:18:35.04 --> 03:18:40.16
He's, and he's got a little, he's got like a pledge about taking ownership

3753
03:18:40.20 --> 03:18:44.96
of what's going on, which is sort of, you know, taking ownership and actively

3754
03:18:44.96 --> 03:18:47.56
participating in what's happening with the country.

3755
03:18:48.52 --> 03:18:49.96
I can't make that claim.

3756
03:18:49.96 --> 03:18:54.76
You know, I'm attacking it from a different angle, which for me, the angle

3757
03:18:54.76 --> 03:18:59.16
is trying to bring manufacturing back to America, trying to grow businesses,

3758
03:18:59.16 --> 03:19:02.44
trying to improve our economy through that methodology.

3759
03:19:02.76 --> 03:19:06.20
But as far as jumping into the arena like him, you know, respect.

3760
03:19:06.24 --> 03:19:07.36
So good on him.

3761
03:19:08.36 --> 03:19:11.80
I wonder what, because you know, like taking responsibility for a mistake,

3762
03:19:11.80 --> 03:19:14.60
it kind of seems real obvious from the outside, or maybe because just because

3763
03:19:14.60 --> 03:19:15.40
you talk at all times.

3764
03:19:15.40 --> 03:19:19.16
So now it's obvious to me, but I wonder if there's like some weird mechanism

3765
03:19:19.16 --> 03:19:25.76
in the political world behind the crypto that kind of like doesn't allow for that.

3766
03:19:25.80 --> 03:19:30.76
You know, like the obvious, not an obvious one, but the one that just hit me

3767
03:19:30.76 --> 03:19:35.72
like right away was, let's say I say something dumb, or I say something about

3768
03:19:35.72 --> 03:19:37.80
something or make a decision that's wrong or whatever.

3769
03:19:37.80 --> 03:19:41.000
And I say, well, I'm not like, I made a, I made a mistake, you know, or whatever.

3770
03:19:41.40 --> 03:19:45.32
Is it because everyone will attack them like in the media, you know, media outlets

3771
03:19:45.32 --> 03:19:48.20
have different sides where they'll attack them.

3772
03:19:48.20 --> 03:19:51.80
They'll attack them and then be like, Hey, uh, freaking Jocko.

3773
03:19:52.52 --> 03:19:55.72
Finally, uh, admits he was wrong.

3774
03:19:55.72 --> 03:19:57.64
No, no, no, they'll say it way worse than that.

3775
03:19:57.64 --> 03:20:02.60
They'll say, finally confirms he's inadequate for this decision making

3776
03:20:02.60 --> 03:20:05.56
type or something like this, you know, I think it may have something to do with.

3777
03:20:05.56 --> 03:20:09.64
Do you remember at the monster that we just went to, there was a woman that asked

3778
03:20:10.04 --> 03:20:13.56
it basically, you know, is it okay to say I'm sorry?

3779
03:20:13.56 --> 03:20:14.04
Yeah.

3780
03:20:14.04 --> 03:20:14.04
Yeah.

3781
03:20:14.04 --> 03:20:17.16
I remember and you know, like, of course it's okay to say it.

3782
03:20:17.16 --> 03:20:20.92
You know, when you make a mistake, you say, sorry, apologize for whatever mistake you made,

3783
03:20:20.92 --> 03:20:27.40
but there's people like there's a whole leadership theory that you never apologize.

3784
03:20:27.40 --> 03:20:27.72
Right.

3785
03:20:27.72 --> 03:20:27.96
Yeah.

3786
03:20:27.96 --> 03:20:28.52
I've heard that.

3787
03:20:28.52 --> 03:20:33.16
And, you know, so I think the thing that we're talking about on the political side,

3788
03:20:33.16 --> 03:20:36.68
I think there's something out there that's very similar.

3789
03:20:36.68 --> 03:20:37.72
Never admit that you're right.

3790
03:20:37.72 --> 03:20:38.92
Never admit that you're wrong.

3791
03:20:38.92 --> 03:20:39.48
Right.

3792
03:20:39.48 --> 03:20:45.64
Never apologize to, you know, the opponent and you know, to me, it's the same thing.

3793
03:20:45.64 --> 03:20:50.20
You're just, if you make a mistake, apologize.

3794
03:20:50.20 --> 03:20:51.000
Hey, this is a mistake.

3795
03:20:51.000 --> 03:20:52.60
Here's what I thought was going to happen.

3796
03:20:52.60 --> 03:20:53.80
Here's what actually happened.

3797
03:20:53.80 --> 03:20:55.08
This is, I was wrong about this.

3798
03:20:55.08 --> 03:20:56.68
Here's what I plan to adjust for next time.

3799
03:20:56.68 --> 03:21:03.40
And I learned a good lesson that I can confirm will not happen again if I can prevent it at all.

3800
03:21:03.40 --> 03:21:04.20
Yeah.

3801
03:21:04.20 --> 03:21:07.32
So yeah, I think it's just that.

3802
03:21:07.32 --> 03:21:12.12
I think it's just, and the other thing is nowadays, I mean, I guess it's not even that,

3803
03:21:12.12 --> 03:21:17.24
just nowadays, what is it, Gerbil said that if you repeat a lie enough, it becomes the truth.

3804
03:21:17.88 --> 03:21:21.40
And so I think a lot of people are just like, yeah, you know, I didn't say that.

3805
03:21:22.04 --> 03:21:23.32
No, I did not say that.

3806
03:21:24.28 --> 03:21:34.76
You know, you know, Chaco, it said, do you still confirm the what you said last week

3807
03:21:34.76 --> 03:21:36.60
about the blah, blah, blah?

3808
03:21:36.60 --> 03:21:39.32
And I go, I did not say that it was taken out of context.

3809
03:21:39.32 --> 03:21:43.48
Right. But even though I did say it, you know, but you said, no, I didn't say that it was taken

3810
03:21:43.48 --> 03:21:47.56
out of context. In fact, that reporter has been known to take things out.

3811
03:21:47.56 --> 03:21:48.52
You know, you just go in there.

3812
03:21:48.52 --> 03:21:52.52
In fact, my opponent has worked with that reporter in the past that that's why they

3813
03:21:52.52 --> 03:21:56.60
asked that question because they're actually, you know, nefarious and their activities.

3814
03:21:57.48 --> 03:21:58.76
So that's what everybody does.

3815
03:21:58.76 --> 03:22:05.40
Everyone just denies, makes counter accusations, tells the lie enough time that it becomes the

3816
03:22:05.40 --> 03:22:12.36
truth. And I think that's the standard operating procedure. And I think most people don't have

3817
03:22:12.36 --> 03:22:18.44
time to pull the thread on it. I mean, some of the presidential debates last year were just

3818
03:22:18.44 --> 03:22:24.92
ridiculous. Like they're just, they're just making accusations and then not even defending

3819
03:22:24.92 --> 03:22:30.60
but just making a counter accusation and just, you know, you said that blah, blah, you said

3820
03:22:30.60 --> 03:22:34.60
that the economy would do this. I never said that. You're like, what are you going to do?

3821
03:22:34.60 --> 03:22:39.000
Go look up the quote? No. So it just becomes two people just shouting at each other.

3822
03:22:40.20 --> 03:22:43.32
It's, it's horrible. The political thing is horrible right now.

3823
03:22:44.12 --> 03:22:48.20
Props to these guys that are, these, these guys that are stepping up and doing something about it,

3824
03:22:48.20 --> 03:22:56.92
good on you. And that's where Ed's at. So good luck, Ed. I think he's going to have a rough time.

3825
03:22:56.92 --> 03:23:01.72
He's got, he's got, he's the problem is not a conformist. You know, he's not conforming to one

3826
03:23:01.72 --> 03:23:06.20
side or the other side. He's got one view over here, but he's got another view. He's got one

3827
03:23:06.20 --> 03:23:11.24
conservative view, one liberal view. Yeah. Do you think, because, you know, when you watch it on TV,

3828
03:23:11.24 --> 03:23:15.000
that's like, so you know what happens? He gets shredded by both. That's what happens. Sorry for

3829
03:23:15.000 --> 03:23:19.56
cutting you off. But only on, because I don't know. I don't know. I don't know everybody. Yeah. But

3830
03:23:20.76 --> 03:23:28.60
it feels like, you know that I don't know. Yes. But I feel like when you're kind of like an honest

3831
03:23:28.60 --> 03:23:33.40
person who's like, oh, wait, like, I know I'm supposed to think this because I'm in this party,

3832
03:23:33.40 --> 03:23:37.24
but like, man, I'm still, I'm still kind of like pumping the brakes a little bit before I go hard

3833
03:23:37.24 --> 03:23:41.000
on it because I want to find out more. And oh, I'm sorry. I made that mistake. And hey, this is

3834
03:23:41.000 --> 03:23:44.76
what I'm going to do. Like this is how we're going to fix this mistake. You know, like, you would

3835
03:23:44.76 --> 03:23:50.28
think that your everyday American person would be like, Hey, I think I like that guy. I think I,

3836
03:23:50.28 --> 03:23:55.08
I think I'd really, I don't know him that much, but you're probably correct. And that the extreme

3837
03:23:55.08 --> 03:24:00.76
people on either side were attack. Right. But it's the normal people like, dude, cut, cut him some

3838
03:24:00.76 --> 03:24:05.08
slack. You know, he said something he didn't mean and he adjusted it. And then, but then they,

3839
03:24:05.08 --> 03:24:11.64
at the same time they watch the news who's like kind of like, if you use the cliche word fear

3840
03:24:11.64 --> 03:24:15.56
mongering, but it's like, they'll fear monger, you know, they'll be like, Hey, wait, this guy

3841
03:24:15.56 --> 03:24:20.04
freaking is already making mistakes or something like that. You know, like they'll put it in your

3842
03:24:20.04 --> 03:24:24.52
head that this guy is unreliable because he made a mistake and he even admitted the thing. Like,

3843
03:24:24.52 --> 03:24:28.28
it's like, he flagrantly made him, you know, it's like that kind of stuff. And it's like,

3844
03:24:28.28 --> 03:24:33.56
bro, you framed that as like this kind of scary bad thing. One really most of us kind of think

3845
03:24:33.56 --> 03:24:38.84
that's good. If you did, if this media, whoever the news, whatever, if they didn't say shit,

3846
03:24:38.84 --> 03:24:42.20
bro, we would have liked that guy. In fact, we wouldn't need that. We need that kind of attitude

3847
03:24:42.20 --> 03:24:48.04
actually, you know. So it's like, man, we're all kind of getting washed up in the cyclone, you know.

3848
03:24:48.04 --> 03:24:53.88
Yeah. At some point, someone's going to break through that has like a common sense attitude.

3849
03:24:53.88 --> 03:24:57.80
That's what I felt too. I was like, Hey, you know, that's actually not true. No, I, you know,

3850
03:24:57.80 --> 03:25:01.96
I said that, but I made a mistake. And here's what, here's, here's a more, here's a more

3851
03:25:02.84 --> 03:25:10.52
a holistic look at that issue. So, and boom, you know, but, but again, if that, if the out,

3852
03:25:10.52 --> 03:25:14.84
if the media outlet is against that person, they're only going to sound bite the negative thing.

3853
03:25:14.84 --> 03:25:18.52
Yeah. That's not to mention, you know, how they say, and I don't know, because obviously I'm not

3854
03:25:18.52 --> 03:25:25.96
in politics at all, but they do say, I've heard people are saying that if you go, let's say,

3855
03:25:25.96 --> 03:25:30.76
you know, like, um, like Tulsi, you know, had this happen to where she'll go in the, I don't

3856
03:25:30.76 --> 03:25:36.28
know, Democratic party, whatever, she'll go in and she'll start doing stuff that's like against,

3857
03:25:36.28 --> 03:25:39.32
quote unquote, against the party, then they'll get drummed out by the party itself. Yeah.

3858
03:25:39.32 --> 03:25:45.08
And if they're playing that freaking like kill them game or whatever, like they'll

3859
03:25:45.08 --> 03:25:49.64
drama person out who's like being all honest and stuff. Yeah. Well, Tulsi's a great example.

3860
03:25:50.52 --> 03:25:57.56
She got crucified. Bro. So it's like this hard ass game to like, to improve genuinely, you know?

3861
03:25:58.36 --> 03:26:04.36
Holy cow. Freaking. I don't know. It feels like, I felt it though, like, I think you're right.

3862
03:26:04.36 --> 03:26:09.40
I think like slowly by slowly, people are going to be like, wait, how about let's actually like do

3863
03:26:09.40 --> 03:26:13.72
the right thing? Yeah. How about, like, let's just try it, you know, a little bit. You know,

3864
03:26:13.72 --> 03:26:19.40
some people are crazy too. There's like crazy people. There's people that they're,

3865
03:26:19.40 --> 03:26:24.36
their political beliefs are a religion and they're fanatical religious people, fanatical

3866
03:26:24.36 --> 03:26:30.60
political people, which to me is, is if you're that focused, if you get emotionally upset

3867
03:26:31.32 --> 03:26:38.52
about political things, then I think you should, you got issues, right? You know,

3868
03:26:38.52 --> 03:26:42.12
you know what I'm saying? Yeah. It's people that get emotionally and look, I can understand,

3869
03:26:42.12 --> 03:26:46.36
you know, you get mad about something or there's something that bothers you. Like,

3870
03:26:46.36 --> 03:26:49.32
oh, that's, you know, that's, that shouldn't do it like that. Right? Yeah.

3871
03:26:50.12 --> 03:26:55.16
But if I'm going crazy about it, yeah, like even you heard me talking about California,

3872
03:26:55.16 --> 03:27:00.68
right? California has done so much dumb stuff in the last two years. And I'd be like,

3873
03:27:00.68 --> 03:27:05.72
you are you kidding me right now? Yeah. But I didn't freak out. I didn't get on.

3874
03:27:05.72 --> 03:27:10.04
That's another thing. If you're on social media and that's like a place where you're spending your

3875
03:27:10.04 --> 03:27:16.04
time flipping out on flipping out on people. What was it? I think I was on that podcast with

3876
03:27:16.04 --> 03:27:22.12
Chris Williamson and he asked me something about what was it? Like, how do you, you know,

3877
03:27:22.12 --> 03:27:26.92
I think it was, it was basically either how do you handle negative comments or something like this?

3878
03:27:27.88 --> 03:27:33.24
And I was like, bro, I mean, my recommendation is you don't spend a bunch of time being concerned

3879
03:27:33.24 --> 03:27:42.68
about bots, brother bots. So I think when you're politically outraged about it, because, because

3880
03:27:42.68 --> 03:27:47.24
here's the other thing you gotta remember. Okay. If you're a lobster man and you're about to have

3881
03:27:47.24 --> 03:27:54.36
your, you're about to have your, your entire ability to provide for your family. I can understand

3882
03:27:54.36 --> 03:27:59.64
getting outraged about that. I can understand being like, Oh, you know what? I'm going to protest

3883
03:27:59.64 --> 03:28:04.52
because they're about to take my livelihood away from me. But there's a lot of things that people

3884
03:28:04.52 --> 03:28:08.60
get emotional about that actually really aren't going to have an impact on their life. Yeah.

3885
03:28:08.60 --> 03:28:13.64
No, no, yeah. Or it's like a hypothetical thing or whatever. Yeah. Also to like,

3886
03:28:14.92 --> 03:28:19.24
and then I don't necessarily see people getting outraged about it, but, but being like really

3887
03:28:19.24 --> 03:28:25.08
concerned about it, you know, on a personal level is the one that does make sense to me is like the

3888
03:28:25.08 --> 03:28:30.84
taxes and stuff where like when you know you're going to get less of your paycheck, that makes

3889
03:28:30.84 --> 03:28:35.96
sense to me. Yeah. You know, yeah. Well, if you want to make, if you want to get even more frustrated

3890
03:28:35.96 --> 03:28:42.76
about that, once you realize that the government is taking a bunch of your money and then you see

3891
03:28:42.76 --> 03:28:47.32
what they're doing with it and you, and you say to yourself, wait a second, right? Like, hey, if you

3892
03:28:47.32 --> 03:28:54.52
were building awesome bridges, you know, and the streets were clean, like look at California,

3893
03:28:54.52 --> 03:28:59.000
if you're like, Hey, you know what? I pay a lot of tax in California, but look, look at Main Street,

3894
03:28:59.000 --> 03:29:03.000
you know, Los Angeles, this beautiful place, but you're not saying that you're literally,

3895
03:29:03.000 --> 03:29:09.16
it's disgusting, right? It's disgusting. And then they do other crazy things. So you could start

3896
03:29:09.16 --> 03:29:12.28
to get a little spun up about that, but you know what you do then you leave the state, which is

3897
03:29:12.28 --> 03:29:17.32
what a lot of people have done. How many people are leaving California? Yeah. A lot. Yeah, that

3898
03:29:17.32 --> 03:29:22.04
should be an indicator. And you could look at the federal taxes the same way. You're like, Hey,

3899
03:29:22.04 --> 03:29:25.96
look, I want to pay for the security law, pay for the military, right? Hey, that's cool to pay for

3900
03:29:25.96 --> 03:29:30.60
some infrastructure. I'm good with that. But then when you start pulling the thread on those things,

3901
03:29:31.56 --> 03:29:36.52
we should do a podcast where we just read through some of those expenditures. Oh, it's insane.

3902
03:29:37.32 --> 03:29:43.08
It's totally insane what the government spends money on. You can't make it up. If I tried to

3903
03:29:43.08 --> 03:29:47.56
make up things right now for dumb stuff for the government to spend money on, I couldn't come

3904
03:29:47.56 --> 03:29:53.40
close to the dumb stuff that they actually spend on government spends money on the dumbest things.

3905
03:29:54.84 --> 03:30:02.76
And yet what are you going to do? Well, you do your best to vote for people that want to tax

3906
03:30:02.76 --> 03:30:09.64
less and that want to have a smaller government because big, the bigger the government doesn't

3907
03:30:09.64 --> 03:30:14.36
become more efficient, doesn't solve more problems. Like when you're going to, when you're doing an

3908
03:30:14.36 --> 03:30:19.000
operation, you're going to have this conversation with life life was like kind of in the learning

3909
03:30:19.000 --> 03:30:25.000
mode and you're taking down buildings and you think, Hey, I was put everyone in the building.

3910
03:30:26.52 --> 03:30:30.12
But you can put so many people in the building that they're kind of in the way. Now you got to

3911
03:30:30.12 --> 03:30:34.36
like hire someone you got to advance or promote someone to be in charge of the other group while

3912
03:30:34.36 --> 03:30:37.16
they're in the building. And that means those two people got to communicate. So you got to put

3913
03:30:37.16 --> 03:30:40.52
someone in charge. You see what I'm saying? All of a sudden you got a bureaucracy in a in a in a

3914
03:30:40.52 --> 03:30:47.32
kill house. We don't want that. That's like the big government problem. You know, a big assault

3915
03:30:47.32 --> 03:30:51.64
force, look, you need an assault force. You have enough people to handle the rooms and handle security

3916
03:30:51.64 --> 03:30:57.08
cool. I get it. But you can't just double that and say, Okay, now it's going to be more efficient.

3917
03:30:57.08 --> 03:31:03.48
It might not be more efficient. And if you triple it, you may have some real issues. Now, now you

3918
03:31:03.48 --> 03:31:09.000
have a problem. And now the problem is the assault force itself. You have a chance of creating a

3919
03:31:09.000 --> 03:31:13.64
blue on blue because there's so many freaking assaulters going in. So the same thing happens

3920
03:31:13.64 --> 03:31:20.76
with the government. I mean, here's they just what this bill coming where there's 87,000 more

3921
03:31:20.76 --> 03:31:28.36
IRS agents. I think it doubles the size of the IRS. That's too many assaulters in the room.

3922
03:31:28.36 --> 03:31:33.48
You should have saved like there's too many. Hey, if the tax code, they don't even know really

3923
03:31:33.48 --> 03:31:40.04
what the tax code is, you know, I hire someone, I can't figure out what my taxes are. I can't even

3924
03:31:40.04 --> 03:31:45.08
come close to figure out what my taxes are. I have to hire someone who's got multiple people

3925
03:31:45.08 --> 03:31:51.16
working for him that goes through and figures all that out. Because that's how complicated it is.

3926
03:31:51.96 --> 03:31:56.28
So I have to pay someone who also pays other people to figure out what I need to pay the government.

3927
03:31:58.44 --> 03:32:02.04
It makes sense that if the government is going to bill me for something, they just give me a bill

3928
03:32:02.04 --> 03:32:11.72
and I pay it. You know, I don't go into a restaurant or dinner and I say, hey, you know, how much do

3929
03:32:11.72 --> 03:32:17.08
I owe you? And they say, well, figure it out. Yeah, here's a scale. You better weigh that rice.

3930
03:32:17.08 --> 03:32:22.20
Yeah, here's the cost of rice right now. And by the way, if you don't come up with the right number,

3931
03:32:23.32 --> 03:32:28.68
we're going to have you arrested when you leave the restaurant because you didn't pay the money

3932
03:32:28.68 --> 03:32:33.32
that you owed us. Well, I don't know how much I owe you. Well, you better figure it out. That's

3933
03:32:33.32 --> 03:32:39.32
crazy. What if you overpay the government like your taxes and you like, let's say you overpaid your

3934
03:32:39.32 --> 03:32:44.36
taxes and it rolls forward. It rolls forward. Do they do that automatically though? Or do you

3935
03:32:44.36 --> 03:32:50.36
have to like say, hey, I overpaid and then they do it? I'm not sure, but I know that my accountant,

3936
03:32:51.32 --> 03:32:57.32
shout out Brandon, good to go. Freakin awesome guy. Sometimes he tells, he sends me a list like,

3937
03:32:57.32 --> 03:33:00.76
this is what you overpaid and how this has got rolled up. But I don't know if he didn't do that,

3938
03:33:00.76 --> 03:33:05.64
would they just be taking that money? Probably. I wonder, yeah. So that would kind of make it

3939
03:33:07.000 --> 03:33:15.72
like officially unfair. Bro, it's officially unfair as it is. Right? I think it's officially

3940
03:33:15.72 --> 03:33:20.20
unfair as it is. You are going to charge me. You want me to pay you money, but you won't tell me

3941
03:33:20.20 --> 03:33:23.72
how much because I got to figure that out. And if I get it wrong, you're going to come arrest me.

3942
03:33:23.72 --> 03:33:28.52
How's that work? How did you know I was wrong? Well, why don't you just tell me what that number

3943
03:33:28.52 --> 03:33:36.92
was? Right? I got to pay this other dude and his team to figure out how much money I owe you.

3944
03:33:36.92 --> 03:33:39.40
And if I don't pay you the correct amount, you're going to arrest me, but you won't tell me what

3945
03:33:39.40 --> 03:33:43.88
that number was. That's a crazy talk. You wouldn't think that that made any sense whatsoever. And

3946
03:33:43.88 --> 03:33:50.12
yet that's how it works. And now we got to hire 87,000 more people. 87,000. By the way, when you

3947
03:33:50.12 --> 03:33:56.04
hire 87,000 people at the government, would you get government federal jobs like that? That's a

3948
03:33:56.04 --> 03:34:02.84
lifetime of pay. That's retirement pay. That's health insurance for the rest of all these people's

3949
03:34:02.84 --> 03:34:09.88
lives. It's health insurance for their families. It's a crazy deal. It's not like you hired a

3950
03:34:09.88 --> 03:34:12.44
small number of people and they're going to do some extra work. And when they're done with that

3951
03:34:12.44 --> 03:34:17.40
extra work, they're going to move on and find another job. No, you're hiring someone for their

3952
03:34:17.40 --> 03:34:25.24
life. That's what a federal job is. So these aren't like small budgetary additions. These are

3953
03:34:26.28 --> 03:34:33.08
a total change, a paradigm shift in the size of this tax collecting organization.

3954
03:34:35.000 --> 03:34:39.56
And that's the best you can do. Everything is digital now. And the best you can do is hire 87,000

3955
03:34:39.56 --> 03:34:44.84
more people to help us figure this out. Are you kidding me right now? So you want to talk about

3956
03:34:44.84 --> 03:34:51.40
stuff that can get you crazy? That's one of them. But nonetheless, I'm talking about it right now

3957
03:34:51.40 --> 03:34:55.32
with you. I've never talked about this with you. And I know when I go home, I'm not going to be

3958
03:34:55.32 --> 03:35:01.24
like fuming about it, right? Yeah. There's issues that people get spun up about. And by the way,

3959
03:35:01.24 --> 03:35:05.64
what I just talked about, that's a pretty serious issue. They're taking money that you worked for,

3960
03:35:06.20 --> 03:35:08.92
they're taking it from you and they're spending on things that don't make any sense.

3961
03:35:08.92 --> 03:35:14.04
That's that if there's one thing that could piss you off, that's definitely in the top seven. I

3962
03:35:14.04 --> 03:35:19.16
agree. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. I mean, would you be mad if I went in, got into your

3963
03:35:19.16 --> 03:35:23.80
car, took your wallet out, took your money and left? Would you be mad? What if I only took 50%

3964
03:35:23.80 --> 03:35:27.80
of your money? Would you be mad? I would be mad. Yes. And but what if I bought you dinner

3965
03:35:28.52 --> 03:35:35.000
with your money? But I also kind of bought me dinner too. So, so people taking your money

3966
03:35:35.000 --> 03:35:39.72
is definitely one of the top things that can be annoying to you and can piss you off. The government

3967
03:35:39.72 --> 03:35:46.68
does that all the time. So, if there's, but that's the top seven, definitely the top seven of things

3968
03:35:46.68 --> 03:35:52.84
that can piss you off, people stealing from you. Hey, look, it's own, it's not stealing up to a

3969
03:35:52.84 --> 03:35:58.20
certain point. Because when I, when the government takes money and they spend it on things that,

3970
03:35:58.20 --> 03:36:02.68
you know, help, hey, okay, we're going to have a good military, we're going to have good infrastructure,

3971
03:36:02.68 --> 03:36:08.44
we're going to have some reserve, you know, fuel in case something goes, hey, I'm in support of

3972
03:36:08.44 --> 03:36:14.92
those things. Cool. I got it. But that hits a limit. The government doesn't need 51% of my money to

3973
03:36:14.92 --> 03:36:22.36
do that. Doesn't. But they're taking it. They're spending on some other shit. Some, some shit that

3974
03:36:22.36 --> 03:36:29.72
I don't, you know, that is not right. So that's where we end up. Yeah. Anyways, you guys are

3975
03:36:29.72 --> 03:36:34.04
talking about the Oak Horse, how you can't just go in there anymore. You think you could do the

3976
03:36:34.04 --> 03:36:40.60
Oak Horse right now? Yeah, 100%. Would you get a good, what do you guys time it? Or something like

3977
03:36:40.60 --> 03:36:44.12
this? Yeah, no, it's definitely timed. No, I probably wouldn't get a great score because there's

3978
03:36:44.12 --> 03:36:48.76
some technique that I'd be rusty on. Is there a minimum you got to make or something? Can you fail

3979
03:36:48.76 --> 03:36:52.52
the Oak Horse? You can definitely fail the Oak Horse. Okay. Would you fail the Oak Horse? No, I would

3980
03:36:52.52 --> 03:36:57.72
pass it. You'd pass it. Would I pass it? I would need to teach it to you for two days and then you'd

3981
03:36:57.72 --> 03:37:03.48
pass it. Oh, no shit. Yeah. If you're, if you're athletic, like, you, if you can do pull-ups,

3982
03:37:03.48 --> 03:37:07.56
push-ups, dips, and you can run, you're going to be okay. It's, it's a, I'll tell you what, that

3983
03:37:07.56 --> 03:37:11.96
Oak Horse is awesome. When you get done with that thing, you're smoked. Oh, it's hard. So like, oh,

3984
03:37:11.96 --> 03:37:18.60
yeah. Solid. How long does it take? Give it roughly. Seven minutes. Oh, damn. Seven minutes of putting

3985
03:37:18.60 --> 03:37:26.60
out. Seven minutes of putting out hard. Like, you know, uh, you know, the, the taste in your mouth,

3986
03:37:26.60 --> 03:37:32.12
you know what I'm saying? Like the, the, the, I just put out real hard. What is it? Like a

3987
03:37:32.12 --> 03:37:36.68
copper taste in your mouth? You know what I'm saying? You get that 100%. Oh, for real. Even if

3988
03:37:36.68 --> 03:37:39.88
you're kind of chilling, like, let's say, let's say you and I went out there weekend, you know,

3989
03:37:39.88 --> 03:37:44.12
we're in the teams and we're just go out there. We're still going to feel it a little bit. But

3990
03:37:44.12 --> 03:37:50.84
when you go hard because you're trying to pass because you're in buds, but I always liked the

3991
03:37:50.84 --> 03:37:56.76
expression putting out. Yeah. I don't think I ever heard that telling you guys or whatever.

3992
03:37:57.64 --> 03:38:03.000
Check. Cool. Well, speaking of putting out, you got it. You got a fuel. Yes. The output. Yes. I'm

3993
03:38:03.000 --> 03:38:07.56
not going to, going to recommend you do that with some clean fuel. The cleanest fuel,

3994
03:38:08.76 --> 03:38:16.12
jockel fuel. It's true. Physical, mental, integrity. Like these are all important things. So when you

3995
03:38:16.12 --> 03:38:20.92
fuel that, you fuel your integrity. How'd you throw that one in there? I got physical, I got mental,

3996
03:38:20.92 --> 03:38:23.80
tossed integrity. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

3997
03:38:24.44 --> 03:38:28.52
You got a kid and they're not the kids lying in school. We give them some jockel fuel, but

3998
03:38:28.52 --> 03:38:33.48
tighten up the integrity. Yeah. It tells the truth. It's true. No, when you're putting out is what

3999
03:38:33.48 --> 03:38:38.28
I'm saying. I'm going to make a new supplement called integrity. Maybe you should. Let's do it.

4000
03:38:38.28 --> 03:38:42.84
All right. There you go. Book it. Put on the books or whatever the expression is you guys use.

4001
03:38:42.84 --> 03:38:49.72
Anyway, yes. When you fuel that output, when you're putting out all that stuff, you want the

4002
03:38:49.72 --> 03:38:54.44
supplements with integrity. You want integrity, me and supplements, that's something. Okay. Energy,

4003
03:38:54.44 --> 03:38:58.44
for example, energy drink. I'm explaining to you like, you don't know, even though I do know that

4004
03:38:58.44 --> 03:39:05.40
you do know energy drink usually has sugarcane, uh, uh, preservatives, you know, poison. Right.

4005
03:39:07.08 --> 03:39:11.72
Jockel fuel does not have that. Clean, only healthy stuff, clean stuff. Yeah. Integrity. That's what

4006
03:39:11.72 --> 03:39:16.52
I mean. Exactly what I'm talking about. Same thing with the malt protein shakes, protein mix,

4007
03:39:16.52 --> 03:39:24.92
and RTD, no sugar. Sweetened with fruit, not even like, uh, sucrose or fruit, toaster,

4008
03:39:24.92 --> 03:39:30.84
actual monk fruit. Monk fruit. So good. So good. Uh, yeah. So check that actually on the way down,

4009
03:39:30.84 --> 03:39:38.20
you heard Keto. What, what, how did Ed describe himself? Keto. Keto. Kuk. Keto kuk. I said, hey,

4010
03:39:38.20 --> 03:39:42.84
man, you want one of these drinks? He goes, I can't, it's a, I'm, I'm a Keto kuk. And I was like,

4011
03:39:42.84 --> 03:39:46.36
we're good. Good to go. He said, there's no sugar in there. I said, no, there's no sugar.

4012
03:39:46.36 --> 03:39:51.32
It's sweetened with monk fruit. And he's like, I'll go crack one open. Keto kuk. Keto kuk.

4013
03:39:51.32 --> 03:39:55.80
Getting after Keto kuk approved. Yep. Actually says, what does it say? It says something on the

4014
03:39:55.80 --> 03:40:04.36
can about Keto. Keto friendly, maybe? Anyways. So there you go. Get yourself some Jockel fuel,

4015
03:40:04.36 --> 03:40:09.96
Jockel fuel.com. Go to Wawa. Go clear the shelves at Wawa. That's what you got to do.

4016
03:40:09.96 --> 03:40:14.92
Clear the shelves at Wawa. Just go, go in there and buy them all. That'll, that will help the

4017
03:40:14.92 --> 03:40:20.52
campaign to grow. Cause people look at Wawa and they say, oh, it's doing really well in Wawa.

4018
03:40:20.52 --> 03:40:25.48
Cool. So if you want to help, if you want to help the campaign of growth, go to Wawa, clear the

4019
03:40:25.48 --> 03:40:31.08
shelves, vitamin shop. Pink mist is at the vitamin shop. Pink mist has kind of been a big hit.

4020
03:40:31.08 --> 03:40:35.80
Yeah. Cross the board. I had one today and it's good. It's one of those like, if you go to,

4021
03:40:35.80 --> 03:40:42.12
like it's, it's, it's kind of what do you call it when it's safe, you know? Or so you can't go

4022
03:40:42.12 --> 03:40:45.96
wrong. You can't go wrong with that one. Oh, well, that's how you feel. A lot of people feel,

4023
03:40:45.96 --> 03:40:49.96
a lot of people feel that's the one. That's the top of the list. That's because you like that mango.

4024
03:40:49.96 --> 03:40:54.68
Mango is the one by far, my opinion, but I'm with it. I'm with the whole gig.

4025
03:40:54.68 --> 03:41:01.48

and you doing it too. Boom. It's true. Also, Jocco's store. It's called Jocco's store.

4033
03:41:48.20 --> 03:41:52.12
It's a store where you can get your discipline equals freedom, shirts and hats and hoodies and

4034
03:41:52.12 --> 03:41:59.000
stuff. Also, we have the shirt locker, which is a subscription shirt every month. Cool designs.

No more days where you don't know what shirt to wear. You got one.

4036
03:42:03.80 --> 03:42:06.44
Don't you normally say it's a subscription situation?

4037
03:42:06.44 --> 03:42:12.04
It is a subscription situation, 100%. Whether I say it or not, it's true. Jockelstore.com.

4040
03:42:21.24 --> 03:42:27.96
safe zone. Sure. What is it? Safe space. It's what it is. We're safe in there. They can't take it

4041
03:42:27.96 --> 03:42:34.12
away from us. That's true. It's kind of not the typical term safe space. No, it's an atypical term.

4042
03:42:34.12 --> 03:42:41.64
But I know that freedom of speech is safe inside Jockelunderground.com. Go check that out. YouTube,

03:44:24.04 --> 03:44:33.32

4060
03:44:33.32 --> 03:44:37.64
Jocko Willings. Just be careful because the algorithm's there and it's not for your friend.

4061
03:44:38.52 --> 03:44:43.64
It's pretending to be your friend. It's going, hey, look at this. Like it's saying that to you.

4062
03:44:43.64 --> 03:44:47.08
Hey, look at this. You're going to show you something. And it's something you want to see.

4063
03:44:47.08 --> 03:44:53.72
Yeah. Well, it's something that your most base form wants to see. You don't want to see it.

4064
03:44:53.72 --> 03:44:57.80
You want to be disciplined. You want to carry on with your life. You want to go execute on

4065
03:44:57.80 --> 03:45:03.08
awesomeness. But instead the algorithms got you like an octopus. I think we need an

4066
03:45:03.08 --> 03:45:10.68
octopus algorithm t-shirt. A bunch of different things trying to tie you up. So there you go.

4067
03:45:10.68 --> 03:45:17.88
Thanks once again to Ed for coming out, sharing your lessons. And thanks for your service to the

4068
03:45:17.88 --> 03:45:23.80

4069
03:45:23.80 --> 03:45:29.40
of our military active duty and retired every branch, every rank out there. Thank you for

4070
03:45:29.40 --> 03:45:33.40
protecting our freedom and our way of life. And thanks to our police and law enforcement,

4071

firefighters, paramedics, EMTs, dispatchers, correctional officers, border patrol, secret

4072
03:45:37.64 --> 03:45:45.80
service, all first responders. Thank you for protecting us here at home. And everyone else out

4073
03:45:45.80 --> 03:45:52.92
there, since we were talking about Maine, I'm going to go ahead and close with some more of the great

4074
03:45:52.92 --> 03:46:03.16
Joshua Chamberlain quote, we can hold our spirits and our bodies so pure and high, we may cherish

4075
03:46:03.16 --> 03:46:13.32
such thoughts and such ideals and dreams such dreams to lofty purpose that we can determine and know

4076
03:46:13.32 --> 03:46:24.60
what manner of men we will be. And that's right. And quote, we can determine what manner of men

4077
03:46:24.60 --> 03:46:35.32
we will be. And we become that man by taking action. So in the parlance of our time,

4078
03:46:35.32 --> 03:46:55.24
get out there and get after it. And until next time, Zeko and Jaco out.
