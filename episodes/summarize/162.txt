so that's rough and I'll tell you one thing that from my mind where's the enemy the enemy's everywhere that you have to approach things as if the enemy can be anywhere and the only way you can know that they're not where they're not everywhere is when you take something down and you secure it that's when you're not there then you move on we recommend that all intelligence assets recon units and surveillance devices that can be made available are deployed in a significant effort to fix the exact location of enemy soldiers and units again this is you can see where this is coming out of this for these guys they must have been completely outflanked all the time where they were thinking where is the enemy we need to know where the enemy is and it's a really hard to know that the enemy can bat who knows where his enemy is hiding experiences this experiences a decided advantage in surprise and the deployment of firepower of course now again this doesn't like I'm saying it's hard to have definitely doesn't mean you mitigate it doesn't mean you don't put up UAV so you can see maneuver doesn't mean you don't gather intelligence doesn't mean people shouldn't report back and and explain where they think the enemy is so we at least have an estimate hmm continuing the combat urban combat tactics the tragedy of urban conflict is that the battlefield for each firefight is a neighborhood each objective taken is someone's home or a school or church or some other structure that has value and more or less significant meaning to its inhabitants considering the possibilities it is not difficult to imagine tank battles across mall parking lots mortar fire hitting a church a hospital community center heavy small arms fire fights between homes and artillery barrage on a school yard while these images may be grist for the mills of Hollywood when we think about them in relevance to our homes and our neighborhood schools and churches the tragedy is somehow increased however it is our collective belief that the life of one marine is more precious than 10 100 homes schools churches shrines shopping malls or any other building known demand therefore all efforts should be made using any and all weaponry available to stun the enemy and support marine advances through the use of supporting arms and without regard to damage to buildings so clearly the whole idea that this started off with of the rules and engagement that we're restricting heavy firepower because the historical nature of the city but if the rules of engagement or in your case like the rule of people coming over what if what if it didn't just apply to your kids what if it applied to the whole block or the whole town or whatever so it's like just to keep everyone safe we got to set this is the standard which is why we don't want communism because they just make rules that are blank it over everyone well that's how laws are even here you know like the gun laws consider the gun laws first they're like hey we need background check but the good rules got to apply to everyone you know you can't like discriminate kind of thing you they have to apply to everybody okay this rule applies to you but kind of kind of you know just maybe 30 percent this rule applies to him 100 percent of course and him too you 1 percent because you're this elite dude so you can you know you have ultimate like you know it's hard to do that especially when you do a like a bunch of people so that's why that can be a pain and that sometimes you seem to say you're apparently that's been bothered you for quite some well how long you live in America for or on this main land like think about like the court system or like So is that the thing you know because yeah the high ground kind of seems simple straightforward or whatever but is there like a blueprint like a simple blueprint for like I remember you told me a story where your son was talking with like a neighbor or something who had I don't know if you want to Vietnam or something like he was in using the military Away City was to remove enemy forces that it captured major sections of the ancient imperial capital of way during the surprise and VA offensive that was quickly dubbed the Tad Offensive due to the historic listen closely due to the historic aspect of many of the buildings in way the usage of heavy weapons was significantly restricted during the initial days of fighting on both sides of the river as friendly casualties mounted and as initial estimates of the size of the enemy force in a way city area was significantly increased fire restrictions were ultimately lifted so they didn't want to damage these historical buildings and so they said hey don't don't use 50 cal don't use group whatever whatever weapons they said they couldn't use and then eventually when the casualties got so bad they said okay go ahead and do what you got to do I say rip the bandade off right if you're gonna go you go if you're gonna go go don't play around that's a good lesson America learns over and over and over again if you're gonna go to war go to win your number one priority over everything else should be doing and by the way if they would have done that I guarantee this city would have been a better shape at the end because the enemy is gonna drag this thing out and it's gonna take longer than you're gonna have to end up destroying every single building that's there Yeah, because you do, that's a slippery slope because if a comment comes and it like, it's like, what's the worst can comment is the kind that's true or kind of true that like, just like, are you saying like, it won't, it's not a hard time. because you Pepper spray me and I have a knife I'm going to grab a hold of you I'm going to come and cut your head off right in a situation that you you got to use the Pepper spray so like if someone's like burglarizing you and you turn on the light and they scatter you don't need the Pepper spray for that kind of situation you know Pepper spray is for someone who like whoa What tactical course just I have like some tactical lessons that I run you know what I mean that you run like as a father or as a what like echelon front has a tactical course like what do you know I have tactical concepts that I teach. yeah people need to understand that continuing on urban combat is nearly always conducted at very close quarters it is not uncommon to have opposing forces fighting from positions a few dozen meters apart most of the fighting is done from a distance between 50 and 500 meters due to this close in nature it is critical to know where the enemy is and how they are deployed again this is a fantasy like knowing where the enemy is and how they're deployed is really hard to do even when you have even when you have overhead coverage looking in the city I'll tell you an example I was watching my guys out on a mission I was watching on a UAV feed so we're watching we're watching and looking for enemy and all of a sudden we see weird activities of vehicle the vehicle stops the vehicle kind of moves a little bit stops again guys get out they look around open up the trunk and now we're totally focused So in here's the thing like there's other thing like some people in I think we most people like we like fighting So, you're just knowing that allows you to go in and, and know, like, okay, you can read them and you just got to know that that's a successful, but it's pretty much now when Jordan Peterson, like, says he reads it, but like, they impact him. You know you're all being over there 25% because you know that's just the standard you know if you know so there's certain things you have to learn in order to be attacked to be proficient and I my son had learned like I'd gone through seven of the courses to understand the tactical things and there was a friend of my wife's friend came over. You know like if you you know these huge, huge men, you know guys who are like seven feet tall you guess what you also need to be able to protect your family that's good to go you know somebody asked me their days like is is is is actually Tim is actually Tim Ferris who's asking me if Pepper spray is good home defense I'm like Pepper spray is good home defense against a person that isn't carrying a weapon I said but like Pepper spray why would you use like think of a real scenario where you would use Pepper spray as a as a human the girl I get it because you have valuable goods regardless of where you go you know you can be at the post stuff you still got those valuable goods that that predators might want as a girl but let's say okay but you you don't get all that information you just don't get it hey those UAVs how high are those depends on the UAV so like can they see them like can people see them or are they just depends on the UAV and like I don't know what the classification of all that stuff is but on top of that you're to you're talking about like your kids or like you know in the military if you're dealing with like one unit or one little group of people so you can maneuver it other advantage of preparatory firing include the destruction over the camouflage of enemy positions the psychological shock factor against enemy troops and the fact that heavy weapons can create new avenues of attack and egress for armored vehicles pretty straightforward one of the most effective aspects of supporting arms during the battle of way were the killer teams that evolved the M48 tank and the antos and the antos is like a it's it's actually a pretty crazy looking machine it's got 160 16 millimeter like cannons on it I'm saying it's not like on Instagram where it's like, hey, you know, it's like, it's just different. So you know, like sports teams, for example, like a, well, I guess football, say football for an example, you practice for like five or six days just practice practice practice practice. so it's never red because it only turns green when the kid but everyone's gonna all be red and the gate will be closed you know you know that sort of happens and here's the thing you can see the gate's quote no truck is coming even if a truck was coming like they got a stop that opened the gate whatever should you stay at that red stop light yeah it's kind of like this is a no-brainer you know this kind of thing like that's a thing and a lot of times even if you're in that in the moment like you can step back and see that when that happens when people are just like hey you're just defending your position just just kind of blindly or whatever you can see that happen I'm not saying like it's so terrible but where like you know like the guy who's like okay on quiet is this red light yeah interesting you know when the first time I found out that the high ground is the spot to be where when I watch the movie called the rock you're watching a song Connor in Nickle's Gate where the Navy seals come up you know they got to go to Alcatraz they come up through the wherever the dream there's something like this yeah I think about like certain laws where if this is going to be the law the land that this law applies to everybody same thing with rules of engagement where they got it because they kind of got applied to everyone right in a certain way so that's why they wind up being so strict or or you know I don't know if they do or don't go to optics too like real good optics I mean just imagine you know the optics that we have in the civilian sector like oh these guys are getting ready to attack open up the trunk and as they're starting to pull stuff out of the trunk my guys get hit from a different spot that we weren't looking because you can't see everything especially in a city because think of it with buildings as soon as you go off angle a little bit you can't see the street anymore because it's down in the building so we actually are totally focused on this one thing and maneuvering the the air asset to look at these people in a car and as as they're as we're monitoring these guys these suspected enemy personnel I'll send my guys get shot at from somewhere else and I see like, you know, any video that's been done, I probably seen it, you know, and I'm around, you know, all the time. You know this, but are you to make these videos like a, you know, parodies of like Darth Vader goes on dates and then I made this one, of course. and then the problem on top of that is because of the where does it stop because of the slippery slope thing the people that don't want any gun laws they just say we don't want any like every single you know well we think we're the background check should be an extra three days no way And you know, you want to dig you on somewhere kennel bells, you know, some jump ropes, battle ropes, like stuff, more good stuff to keep you on the path, keep you on shape. It's kind of like, um, you think everyone, do you think anyone ever got to this point three hours deep into the podcast and you were I said and subscribe and they reach down to their like, they're just all my stuff. oh well then you agree that everyone should be able to get every gun they want to know actually I don't agree with that I think that there's some people that don't need guns I can say that I can say that without without thinking without saying oh well jocco believes in gun control for everyone it's like And it's interesting where I think probably in a lot of cases, I probably am more trained in it than most people, even most people companies that you work with or whatever, because I'm kind of getting it second hand and listening because it applies to everyday life, you know, like this whole deal. yeah just more effective in the rectifier all day long continuing supporting arms supporting arms the most effective our most effective prior to danger close to minimize the potential of friendly casualties and maximize preparatory fires to support the infantry's attack during operation way city the most effective indirect fire during danger close was from an eight inch gun we recommend that the supporting access of fire be perpendicular as well as parallel finally in the event as in the case of operation way city that due to political considerations that proper preparatory fires would not be allowed that a variety of artillery fires such a smoke delayed fuses high angle can be incorporated with the infantry's attack combined arms training for urban combat as critical it's covered move that's what supporting arms do they lay down cover And that sounds like a profound level to like that's like a that's good if you can keep that in mind. Like the, the old that that's going to that chest in his or like in, in Mike in the dragons, you know when he's open opening up the chest and filled with war gear. And just like I said, like it takes, it takes, like, okay, how you say, I don't really get to spar. It sounds like these guys did not have good decentralized command in terms of actually knowing what the overall plan was because it sounds like the fire teams were there, even the putty and the fire team levels were a little bit lost at points. a if you don't want historical buildings destroyed don't have a war and if you think we should save a building and that's gonna cost the life of one of our brothers not happening continuing at the same time the use of heavy weaponry and urban combat is an assuredly two-edged sword as our many assets in modern warfare rubble can be nearly as effective as a building for protecting enemy firing positions further artillery and other flat trajectory weapons may be somewhat restricted by the height of buildings and their distance from each other in many cases mortars although smaller in caliber were superior because of their higher trajectory so interestingly indirect fire indirect fire taking the indirect approach is often better than the flat trajectory I'm gonna shoot through your front door But the, you know, these people at work when they apply it, when you don't, when you have a whether it be a corporate job or whatever, you know, anytime where you have bigger teams, different personalities, you know, you care about, yes, on different levels. Oh, yeah, look, it's us doing what we talked about before earlier today about doing things like, because that's just how, you know, we got to think. so when these rules get put in place they gotta apply to everybody the lowest common denominator person and unfortunately these highest higher denominational people gotta apply to them too because you know you can't just go down the line and be like they can and I'm thinking about laws too where there's certain groups or individuals that's like man that law kind of shouldn't apply to me because I know better you know so so we think about that when we're dealing with people punching them in the face is not as good as coming from an indirect position where they don't quite see where it's coming from but it still gives them a little crack and it's even to the point where he says the even though they're smaller in caliber so even though somebody does something that you want to straighten them out on when you hear them in the face we know what the reaction is they get defensive all that things when we come from from a flank or indirect fire it's smaller caliber not even as it's doesn't hate as hard but it's more effective well rules will get put in place for sure because people don't trust the subordinates that have to fall the rule right you tell your kids you're not allowed to go in the yard because the pools out there right what you're really saying is I don't trust that you're not going to go in the pool or I don't trust that you're that you can swim all enough if you're a good leader you'll be like Like it's so, it's such a metaphor, even teaser word metaphor seems like it's like detail. yeah make sense they continue in our respectful opinion our ability to successfully complete the mission was initially severely impacted by the rules of engagement again this is a lack of trust up and down the chain equipment if I have to impose strict rules of engagement on my people I haven't trained them well enough I don't trust them they don't trust me they don't understand the strategic mission and we have a real problem continuing although it is understood that mission and rules engagement are not the exclusive responsibility of marine leadership at the cartoon company battalion or even regimental level it is strongly recommended that every effort is made at every level in the chain of command to ensure that balance has been achieved between the demands of the mission and the effect of the rules of engagement on the ability of the command to perform the mission successfully but the rules got applied everybody that's the thing has to apply to everyone what about the new driver who's like they can discern quite as well where a safe red light running situation versus a not so safe red light running situation and then there's a spectrum you know right you know if my kids actually understood what I really meant is like hey if you want to have a couple kids over that's cool don't get crazy don't eat my food no weird stay away from the milk no weirdos If you know what combat is like, you know what I'm talking about when I say catastrophically. no you know if they understood all that which actually that's what my kids were like okay got a couple kids coming over it's all good So kind of thing, you know, it's like, yeah, you train yourself to be uncomfortable or to be trained in being uncomfortable. They just had to get out of there and that E8 gas launcher, it's like a suitcase looking thing and it's got eight tubes that have eight rounds at each and them and it fires them like five seconds apart. Because, you know, if you like the video version or you didn't know there was a video version, you can leave comments there, too.
