And of course, we got the little, we got tape cassettes too, you get the dub tape cassette But even that was kind of hard to get because they would all sound like crap Not that we really cared that much, I mean, let's face it Nowadays, everybody kind of listens to everything There's a lot out there Not to mention the crop, all the crossover Seems same, you got country and you got what the naz kid You know, old town road, you know, they got, we got a lot across the, just want to say So you could, you're just opening it up even wider Because, oh yeah, now you really are listening to everything Things are getting crazy It's a kind of upsetting now Really, like when they start rapping in country They do throw you for a loop sometimes, yeah and I just think it's very visceral and the way that we approach Like it's like the last show of our lives, you know, we do that every night and I don't know any other way to do it, you know, and Matt doesn't Christopher, we're just like, you know, a few wild animals up there. It was more money than I'd ever seen and it was like oh, okay, here's you know I could have lived off that that was more money than I'd made probably in the previous four years You know, I'm doing of doing the music so you are getting it's like it's like you're uh You know when you were a kid Maybe I tell this You know why though I think Because you know like I used to do when I used to make Like more Like don't show me say like narrative type videos It's like feel like I can make it, you know, but And then what's the deal on you know, what are you oh, in other words, are you like, hey, I better get another album out and another, you know, because you just you just put out your latest album, what? And so he was kind of always blown away by the idea like how did this sort of this child come from You know, he used to say that he could throw ball at me Like when we were young, my brother was like a year and a half, all of a, he could just throw a ball at me when I was like two maybe and I was like, oh, let's go get a guitar When you talk about music, I don't know if you think this, I think this, when I was younger Like within, when I met someone, shook their hands, hey nice to meet you, within the first Let's say seven to nine minutes of talking to someone, I would say what kind of music do you like? But if you want to see what Jake Smith the white buffalo looks like if you want to figure out why they call him the white buffalo You because he kind of represents that Wipe off you know visual kind of way Come and check it out subscribe to the YouTube YouTube channel hit like Smash the like And instead I was able to be 100% true to the songs that I write that artists that I wanted to be And never had to do anything that I didn't want to do It always my vision and always 100% from me, which is Super rare these days, especially I mean there's like, you know, the song on the radio you got 15 people wrote it, you know, it's like It's kind of unheard of So I was on the athletic side, especially for a big man That I was going to be like, the next like cow ripkin, like, you know, and he was, you know, big I mean, to get people during parts of the show that You know, the people want to fight during this time people are crying, you know, and you'll see right you see like a military guy in a Fucking hippie in there and you know, and some guy from some other completely different background but you can find you try to find that one Like there's some like Japanese sites and stuff that will have that CD which I weren't that many of them because they were just like They're like five hundred bucks or something just stupid, you know for this well and he's like you know the conflict in these you know it's like this show is basically these Emotional men doing kind of terrible shit You know and then I just basically wrote the whole album in about a week A week and a half and before I was like, you know, I have a little snippets that are coming in You know, but then to realize and then finish them really fast sometimes sometimes you know, it's like added Sometimes it's out of just inspiration and desperation And I'm proud to be that, you know, for a while it's odd because I'm actually not that serious of a dude You know, I'm pretty like if you went drinking with me like that guy really you know It was out of my hands, which is normally which is that was the only time I really made that Mistake you know, but you live in your learn and it happens dance to look back and go like You know you discontinued and then you re-recorded it later Which seems like it was a moment in time and even if I was green I think the songs were still good Why I re-recorded it and discontinued that other one. That's a game record at the same time Okay, there was some complications What happened to that album like what happened that album that you fell like you lost control of it a little Did they go and overproduced or something or they like to Jim you know Jimmy on the freaking league guitar and it's Fender and here and start cranking out I mean like Playing every other Wednesday at the sushi bar and C.O.B.H. and playing in the corner this bar B.Q. restaurant in San Ana and just like take jar out tip jar making you know Between 50 and 300 bucks a pop and sleeping on people's couches State of my buddy's house for like maybe a year and a half in their guest room. Because it would be like a straight up indicator, it would tell you a lot about them And nowadays, like sometimes I meet, I got four kids and they're all whatever, 20, 19, 17 and 10 And for a while, I would say, you know, what kind of music do you like to these kids? but then I had these other songs I was like because confining You know if you're like especially when I think of a concept album as a narrative to be like oh whether this song about the fires and California in 2018 or there this song about that wouldn't really fit in the construct of that and I have a lot of that kind of conflict and some of my songs too that it's something that's got it that feels like kind of a badass but got he's maybe kind of a sweetheart I think or you feel for this guy who's really it's a murder song, you know, but you're he's kind of the hero though at the same time Like nowadays, if you're a kid and you're going to play sports, your parents Like cool, you're going to do that sport, you're going to play it 365 days a year, you're going to get coaching, you're going to get some private Whatever, hitting batting coach, that's coming to work with you and your kids like, oh, we need a batting coach But he's like he's red head of that's big like ginger beard kind of like wispy You know, not a whole lot of hair and a column of self cool to use cool And they're just, it's so, there's so much music, there's so much music out there You know, you know, you used to get the weird avoidance answer to that question, it's like, oh, let's never think Yeah, you know what you're saying? and but I think that this super long haul that it's taken me and even now I'm still a Little secret, you know, it's not like I'm a superstar her people know I'm like walk down the street I woke up the night before and How did an idea saying it into my phone and Was like okay, well, at least I can show them that tomorrow and then we'll work on that all day I can see what happens Well, I picked that to him I sang a term I think it was kind of the idea it was actually quite realized but it's like my son was like sleeping I had this little tiny studio fucking place where sleeping and my son sleeping on the I am, I'll be like, oh shit, you know, I love people that really like me really like me It doesn't fit in an email category, you know, even you have this Americana idea now, but it doesn't it's not Air quotes I don't know, it just it doesn't seem I don't know it feels like I don't belong in that genre either I mean part of it does part of it's kind of this country.
