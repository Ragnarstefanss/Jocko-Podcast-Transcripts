Is it, you know how like when you're close to someone, you kind of have this kind of picture of them, you know, like this, like this, like this, just idea of who they are, right? Because, you know, that's a common thing, especially in the beginning where you're like, you have a hard round or hard three rounds or whatever, and then I've hear like, oh, and you flop on the, on the mat or whatever, you know, and it's like, oh, you're acting tired right now. Like, like, you know many people have come up to me like, well, been on the path for like two years now. And you know, like senior listeners, senior officers to like children or juniors, and it was almost like a technique, like a leadership style. You know, like, because it's like that, almost like a, like, a social comfort zone. And I said something like, he said something like, you know, you got to expect things like this to happen. And I was like, day, like he took this whole thing where people are worried about their careers and the freaking, ah, that's that, the other thing he goes, you got to expect things like that. You know, I don't want to be, you know, getting yelled at by people or, you know, outrank me and whatever that idea was of what the military was like. You know, you know, you know, Jock, you got to expect things like this to happen. But then as long as it passes kind of that one standard layer that it needs to pass, you know, you know, the one where you're like, you know what? And you know, he was like an average guy, you know, 3.3 or 3.6, something like that. You know, like, you know, if you just, especially if they make a quick, like, drastic change. You know, like a like a fleet officer, you know, and he was a lieutenant. This is a resource that people need to live the life they want doesn't mean you have to be rich doesn't mean you have to drive fast cars and have a nice house it means you have to have this resource to help the people around you do the things that they need and if you don't think about that you're not going to have it when you need it. It gives you and I would say people are now kind of discovering like they'll tell you hey when you're over 60 you should try and learn an instrument or try and learn a new language because it makes your brain is like your body needs work. Here's the, I think like, well, in my specific case, and I'm sure other people like this too, where it's kind of a gift and a curse situation where that, yeah, I'm just saying, is that kind of like, you know, when you're playing a plane like your instruments? And like, holy cow, like, would you like to be able to control your heart rate? Like, don't, I mean, I guess you could oversimplify it and put, like, don't show weakness or whatever, but it was like, don't act tired, even if you are tired. Yeah if you don't put the goal in place you're going to always be looking to Saturday night or whatever that you know equivalent is in your life which is do I have enough money to pay the rent do you know when you're do I have enough money to feed the kids do I have enough money for the car payment whenever those things are. Yes, wish one of those people are like close to you, which, you know, I guess, you know, I see it, I understand. And he was like, you know, let me know what's going on with the client. Even your safety right you know like medical or whatever like if you break your leg or get some infection or something living in the van. Like it's like, oh, my whole image of you is like changing now, I'm uncomfortable. But like, well, what if it's like, because in my mind, it has like a non-regid approval process. You have to know your objectives you have to know what your objectives are to put meaning around the things you are doing set physical goals like running a 5k or deadlifting 8000 pounds. And if you don't think about it, you know if you're going to talk to if you're going to have a code and your 18 years old look you're not going to start thinking to many questions say that you're not. It's almost like, oh, the friend that I know, even though you're better technically, the friend that I've come to know and love your distance is different. Or like something you could do in the middle of like a barbecue or something like that. Dave this is kind of our life not political side but working with companies and going in and having people ask us questions and you know we're going to score 94% I've heard that question or very close similar question that If I'm a person that doesn't doesn't care about money and I'm like you know money's not important to me I'm going to be chasing that dollar for the rest of my life. That would be like, everyone be like, oh, that's kind of old school concept kind of thing. And most people that get on the path they're not jumping on the path so they can end up with a Ferrari like that's not the path that they're on this idea of financial management and recognizing that this is a practice resource that everybody needs to fulfill whatever is you want. Now, you know, mad at whatever, but then every once in a while, like you'll get one be like, hey, wait, what are you doing over here? Like, you're going to go to this pub, you're going to go to this wake, you're going to perform this religious service, you're going to do this. If you got an idea in your head, and there's something in it, and look, I know what it feels like, how the idea is in your head, you have to get that thing out. Like, you know, even sometimes you'll, you'll be like, um, you'll take extreme ownership, but it'll be real obvious that you're blaming me. That's to me sounds like you, you know, you took like a an aerobics class. You know, like, well, maybe I actually, you know what? You know you also see it with like like politicians. You know like you like
