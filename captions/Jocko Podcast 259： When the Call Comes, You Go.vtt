00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.16
This is Jockel Podcast number 259 with me, Jockel Willink.

2
00:00:05.16 --> 00:00:09.60
The A1E's arrived just as the team started taking incoming mortar fire.

3
00:00:09.60 --> 00:00:16.08
Godwin quickly calculated the coordinates for the mortar's location and the information was passed on to Kavi

4
00:00:16.08 --> 00:00:18.04
who in turn related to the A1E's.

5
00:00:18.04 --> 00:00:21.28
A laconic whistling voice came back down the line.

6
00:00:21.28 --> 00:00:25.28
It's crispy critter time, so y'all keep your heads down.

7
00:00:25.28 --> 00:00:29.92
Within seconds the area in front of the team exploded into flame.

8
00:00:29.92 --> 00:00:35.36
The deadly napaam coating everything in its erupting path, flaming NVA soldiers ran briefly

9
00:00:35.36 --> 00:00:38.92
toward the team before falling to the ground and agonizing death throws.

10
00:00:38.92 --> 00:00:43.04
The hand grenades and ammunition they carried cooking off like firecrackers.

11
00:00:43.04 --> 00:00:47.48
Unfortunately, the elephant grass was also set on fire.

12
00:00:47.48 --> 00:00:51.92
The napaam had definitely slowed the NVA advance, but it had not stopped it.

13
00:00:51.92 --> 00:00:59.36
Kavi reported that extraction chopper were five minutes out and the team needed to move fast.

14
00:00:59.36 --> 00:01:04.36
Two gunships from the 7th Air Cav roared over the LZ.

15
00:01:04.36 --> 00:01:09.84
Watkins put out two bright orange marker panels and the gunships confirmed they had the team

16
00:01:09.84 --> 00:01:10.84
in sight.

17
00:01:10.84 --> 00:01:14.92
As they looped back to make their first strafing run, the gunships reported that a large enemy

18
00:01:14.92 --> 00:01:20.48
force was moving toward the LZ and they were going to attempt to discourage it.

19
00:01:20.48 --> 00:01:26.40
As they made their run pouring M60 machine gun fire and rockets into the enemy, RT lion

20
00:01:26.40 --> 00:01:30.88
could see the air filled with green tracers, hating the helicopters.

21
00:01:30.88 --> 00:01:35.04
They were taking a vicious beating, but they hung in there and kept pouring fire down on

22
00:01:35.04 --> 00:01:36.04
the NVA.

23
00:01:36.04 --> 00:01:40.80
It was an incredible show of raw guts and determination.

24
00:01:40.80 --> 00:01:45.60
Kavi came on the radio to say the gunships had taken casualties and were leaking fuel, oil,

25
00:01:45.60 --> 00:01:49.72
hydraulic fluid and just about everything else, so they were being forced to head home.

26
00:01:49.72 --> 00:01:53.24
But the extraction slicks were on station.

27
00:01:53.24 --> 00:01:59.64
RT lion looked around and could see its salvation coming toward it on its nose.

28
00:01:59.64 --> 00:02:04.84
Although they were flying at a good clip, it appeared as if they were moving at an agonizingly

29
00:02:04.84 --> 00:02:06.40
slow speed.

30
00:02:06.40 --> 00:02:11.72
As with the gunships before them, they were taking a horrendous amount of fire.

31
00:02:11.72 --> 00:02:15.76
One chopper was hit badly and began losing fuel.

32
00:02:15.76 --> 00:02:20.08
After a brief confabbed the rescue package suddenly broke off its approach and headed back

33
00:02:20.08 --> 00:02:27.88
the way it had come, leaving nothing but smoke and RT lion's hopes for rescue behind.

34
00:02:27.88 --> 00:02:32.16
When Watkins asked Kavi what this meant in terms of time on the ground, all heartness

35
00:02:32.16 --> 00:02:37.52
could do was say that he'd contact the S3 and ask for a new set of extraction assets

36
00:02:37.52 --> 00:02:38.52
ASAP.

37
00:02:38.52 --> 00:02:42.92
In the meantime, he promised to get more tactical air support over the team and do all he could

38
00:02:42.92 --> 00:02:44.36
to keep them alive.

39
00:02:44.36 --> 00:02:49.84
While Watkins appreciated the sentiments, this did not do much to raise his spirits.

40
00:02:49.84 --> 00:02:54.24
In his heart of hearts, he felt the team's position was precarious and likely to get

41
00:02:54.24 --> 00:02:57.60
much worse and quickly.

42
00:02:57.60 --> 00:03:02.44
The NVA had literally thousands of men it could throw at the team while the team had

43
00:03:02.44 --> 00:03:07.48
only so much ammunition and not much by way of cover.

44
00:03:07.48 --> 00:03:11.40
What he told his team members however was that there was going to be a slight delay and

45
00:03:11.40 --> 00:03:15.44
reminded them to keep vigilant and be ready for an attack.

46
00:03:15.44 --> 00:03:19.80
What he didn't have the heart to tell them was it could be hours before another rescue

47
00:03:19.80 --> 00:03:22.04
attempt was made.

48
00:03:22.04 --> 00:03:24.68
Their stay at Oscar A was far from over.

49
00:03:24.68 --> 00:03:28.20
One of the bruise suddenly signaled that NVA troops were crawling toward the team through

50
00:03:28.20 --> 00:03:29.60
the elephant grass.

51
00:03:29.60 --> 00:03:34.72
The news was passed on to Kavi who responded that he had two A1E standing by one loaded

52
00:03:34.72 --> 00:03:37.000
with CBUs and the other with rockets.

53
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.08
Both aircraft had their deadly 20mm cannons locked and loaded.

54
00:03:41.08 --> 00:03:45.64
rockets told Kavi to bring in the CBUs fast as possible and delay it down as close to the

55
00:03:45.64 --> 00:03:47.84
team as they could get.

56
00:03:47.84 --> 00:03:52.80
In less than two minutes, the team saw an A1E appear in front of their position.

57
00:03:52.80 --> 00:03:55.76
It's 20mm cannons roaring away.

58
00:03:55.76 --> 00:04:00.16
It flew so low they could see the pilot turn his head to locate the team as he released

59
00:04:00.16 --> 00:04:02.04
his ordinance.

60
00:04:02.04 --> 00:04:06.76
Unfortunately some of the mini bombs exploded so close to RT Lyon that two bruise

61
00:04:06.76 --> 00:04:12.68
received light wounds.

62
00:04:12.68 --> 00:04:14.92
This was distressing but walk-ins consider it one of the acceptable prices a recontain paid

63
00:04:14.92 --> 00:04:19.44
to keep from being overrun by a superior force.

64
00:04:19.44 --> 00:04:24.48
As the A1E is departed a small group of NVA suddenly rose up out of the grass behind the

65
00:04:24.48 --> 00:04:28.92
team and charged them, AK-47's blazing on full automatic.

66
00:04:28.92 --> 00:04:34.08
DeSetta, his red communist star facing forward rose up and opened fire at near point

67
00:04:34.08 --> 00:04:35.08
blank range.

68
00:04:35.08 --> 00:04:39.04
The broo joined in as other groups of NVA popped up from the elephant grass and attempted

69
00:04:39.04 --> 00:04:41.88
assault after assault.

70
00:04:41.88 --> 00:04:46.32
What followed was several hours of deadly cat and mouse with the mouse hunkered down and

71
00:04:46.32 --> 00:04:51.80
it's a little hole and the NVA cat making poss-wipe after poss-wipe in attempt to claw

72
00:04:51.80 --> 00:04:54.76
it out or do it in.

73
00:04:54.76 --> 00:04:59.36
And ironic situation for the team to find itself in.

74
00:04:59.36 --> 00:05:04.60
While RT Lyon fended off attacks, Kavi directed air strike after air strike at the NVA

75
00:05:04.60 --> 00:05:09.40
troops, the storage area, the anti-aircraft guns and anything else he could draw a bead

76
00:05:09.40 --> 00:05:11.28
on.

77
00:05:11.28 --> 00:05:15.68
Throughout the day, primary and secondary explosions followed one another as the strikes

78
00:05:15.68 --> 00:05:17.80
found their mark.

79
00:05:17.80 --> 00:05:22.20
Whenever the team's fate, whatever the team's fate might turn out to be, the NVA were

80
00:05:22.20 --> 00:05:26.84
paying a hellacious price for messing with it.

81
00:05:26.84 --> 00:05:32.84
With daylight, ammunition and ideas running out, it was like a true message from God when

82
00:05:32.84 --> 00:05:39.08
Watkins heard Kavi report that South Vietnamese Air Force 219 Special Operations Squadron

83
00:05:39.08 --> 00:05:43.52
had one of its legendary King Bees and route.

84
00:05:43.52 --> 00:05:48.12
For once, Watkins spirits actually rose.

85
00:05:48.12 --> 00:05:52.56
Not that he didn't love the living daylights out of the 7th Air Cavs, but the Vietnamese

86
00:05:52.56 --> 00:06:00.28
of the 219th had time after time after time, proven themselves to be about the most daring,

87
00:06:00.28 --> 00:06:07.64
most imaginative, most aggressive, and all around finest pilots on the face of the globe.

88
00:06:07.64 --> 00:06:12.96
If RT Lyon had any chance of getting out of this hellhole, a King Beep pilot was the one

89
00:06:12.96 --> 00:06:20.28
who would find it and exploit it no matter how slight the chance was or how deadly the odds.

90
00:06:20.28 --> 00:06:26.36
That was simply what they were pledged and committed to doing day after day.

91
00:06:26.36 --> 00:06:31.000
Our good news followed when Kavi relayed that the lone King Be would be escorted by Marine

92
00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:39.28
gunships from 8ML367, a bad bunch of fires that went by the code named Scarface.

93
00:06:39.28 --> 00:06:42.32
Things were definitely going to rock and roll with them on station.

94
00:06:42.32 --> 00:06:46.92
Scarface enjoyed nothing more than kicking NVA but and taking names and then coming back

95
00:06:46.92 --> 00:06:50.16
around to kick more but just for good measure.

96
00:06:50.16 --> 00:06:55.16
On general principle and for the sheer fun of it.

97
00:06:55.16 --> 00:07:00.68
However Kavi splashed a healthy dose of cold water on walkins by reminding him it was very

98
00:07:00.68 --> 00:07:05.64
nearly dark and that despite all the bombs dropped, rockets fired and gun runs made.

99
00:07:05.64 --> 00:07:10.68
The enemy was still pumping out an enormous amount of fire and still moving forward.

100
00:07:10.68 --> 00:07:15.36
Pulling RT Lyon out of Oscar was going to be as difficult and dangerous in extraction

101
00:07:15.36 --> 00:07:17.48
as could be imagined.

102
00:07:17.48 --> 00:07:20.32
And they would have just one chance to pull it off.

103
00:07:20.32 --> 00:07:25.36
If they muffed it, RT Lyon would be spending the night and would most likely not see the

104
00:07:25.36 --> 00:07:27.72
next morning.

105
00:07:27.72 --> 00:07:31.72
So-boring information indeed but walkins did not want to discourage his team so he just

106
00:07:31.72 --> 00:07:37.000
gave them his best grin and said let's get ready to go.

107
00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:43.40
In the distance walkins could hear the distinctive sound of the old 9 piston, Sechorsky

108
00:07:43.40 --> 00:07:49.20
H34 King Beech shoving its way along a steady base note to the higher walk-wop of the

109
00:07:49.20 --> 00:07:50.76
Louise.

110
00:07:50.76 --> 00:07:55.80
He squinted into the twilight and when he could finally make out their dim silhouettes,

111
00:07:55.80 --> 00:08:01.12
he flashed his stroke through the barrel of an M79 grenade launcher so as to mask it from

112
00:08:01.12 --> 00:08:03.16
enemy sight.

113
00:08:03.16 --> 00:08:09.04
The helicopter's acknowledged having RT Lyon's mark and the Louise immediately divided

114
00:08:09.04 --> 00:08:13.44
and made a split run, one raking the team's forward perimeter with rockets and machine gun

115
00:08:13.44 --> 00:08:15.44
fire and the other working its rear.

116
00:08:15.44 --> 00:08:18.64
It was a beautiful show.

117
00:08:18.64 --> 00:08:22.80
The walkins yelled over the noise to blow all the claymores by setting off all the claymores

118
00:08:22.80 --> 00:08:27.32
at once he hoped to avoid having any uninvited NVA join the team.

119
00:08:27.32 --> 00:08:33.80
They went off in a deafening blast and blinding flash, the little mouse had roared.

120
00:08:33.80 --> 00:08:38.40
As the scar face duo looped around to make their second final run, they confirmed there

121
00:08:38.40 --> 00:08:43.56
were dozens of dead and dying NVA scattered around within feet of the bomb crater.

122
00:08:43.56 --> 00:08:46.68
Unfortunately they also saw more troops advancing.

123
00:08:46.68 --> 00:08:50.12
It was down to the short strokes.

124
00:08:50.12 --> 00:08:55.20
As the scar face gunships began their last pass, the king be tucked itself in behind

125
00:08:55.20 --> 00:08:58.12
them and came roaring on.

126
00:08:58.12 --> 00:09:03.28
Rather than sat down outside the crater and have the team come to him, as Watkins fully

127
00:09:03.28 --> 00:09:07.56
expected the pilot pulled up and hovered over the crater.

128
00:09:07.56 --> 00:09:13.40
As the team looked up and disbelief, the old aged 34 warbird began gently settling itself

129
00:09:13.40 --> 00:09:17.16
down toward the team like a mother hand about to cover her chicks.

130
00:09:17.16 --> 00:09:21.76
Thus also decreasing the silhouette to enemy troops.

131
00:09:21.76 --> 00:09:27.60
By the light of the burning elephant grass, Watkins was able to see into the king bees

132
00:09:27.60 --> 00:09:33.48
cocked it and was startled to find the copilot seat empty.

133
00:09:33.48 --> 00:09:40.28
In the pilot seat was as much admired friend Captain On, a man who had saved Watkins

134
00:09:40.28 --> 00:09:47.96
bacon on many other occasions, but none quite like what he faced here at Oscar 8.

135
00:09:47.96 --> 00:09:52.10
Captain On lowered his king be toward the team with a precision and steadiness that

136
00:09:52.10 --> 00:09:56.40
gave an entirely new meaning to the word cool.

137
00:09:56.40 --> 00:10:00.64
His face was smooth and calm, but there was steel in his eyes as he worked both feet

138
00:10:00.64 --> 00:10:04.44
and hands to maneuver the choppers close to RT line as he could.

139
00:10:04.44 --> 00:10:09.96
At one point Watkins could have sworn that On nodded to him as if an occasional greeting.

140
00:10:09.96 --> 00:10:13.76
The whole scene bordered on surrealistic.

141
00:10:13.76 --> 00:10:18.60
What would the LZ lit by a flickering brush fire, the sounds of gunfire and explosions,

142
00:10:18.60 --> 00:10:26.44
the smell of cordite and burned human flesh, and this improbable savior hovering above.

143
00:10:26.44 --> 00:10:31.44
As Watkins had experienced before, the action took on a dreamlike quality sounds faded as

144
00:10:31.44 --> 00:10:35.56
if someone had turned down the volume, the air thickened, movement appeared to be in slow

145
00:10:35.56 --> 00:10:40.36
motion, and the brain snapped individual frames that would never ever be forgotten.

146
00:10:40.36 --> 00:10:45.24
The looks of fear or pain on their faces, bodies being blasted backward, a piece of

147
00:10:45.24 --> 00:10:50.56
someone on the ground, a scrap of cloth, one's own hand clutching a weapon or shaking wildly

148
00:10:50.56 --> 00:10:55.52
as it tries to execute some simple well rehearsed, but now impossible difficult task.

149
00:10:55.52 --> 00:10:59.52
This is what Watkins looks like to a mind-understress.

150
00:10:59.52 --> 00:11:04.44
Watkins could hear small arms fire thumping into the king be as body as he fully expected

151
00:11:04.44 --> 00:11:10.12
that at any moment it would either pull up an exit or come crashing down on them.

152
00:11:10.12 --> 00:11:11.84
But it did neither.

153
00:11:11.84 --> 00:11:19.12
It settled into a stationary hover, its front wheels placed delicately inside the crater.

154
00:11:19.12 --> 00:11:25.52
And there it sat, an unbelievable vision, a heroic portrait of an old warrior taking a pounding

155
00:11:25.52 --> 00:11:29.88
but refusing to falter.

156
00:11:29.88 --> 00:11:34.60
Watkins, DeSata, and Godwin begin heaving the brew into the chopper.

157
00:11:34.60 --> 00:11:35.60
Godwin followed.

158
00:11:35.60 --> 00:11:41.40
DeSata after taking an anxious look at his team leader was next, his bright red star pointed

159
00:11:41.40 --> 00:11:46.76
over his right ear as if he wasn't quite sure whether he wanted to be going or staying.

160
00:11:46.76 --> 00:11:51.40
Finally in accordance with that time-honored tradition, the one-zero feet with a last

161
00:11:51.40 --> 00:11:55.32
to leave the killing ground of Oscar eight.

162
00:11:55.32 --> 00:12:00.24
With the door gunner and team pouring small arms fire and M79 rounds into the perimeter

163
00:12:00.24 --> 00:12:07.04
beyond its rim, the king lifted up and out of the crater.

164
00:12:07.04 --> 00:12:11.64
As a last to find gesture, Watkins threw a red smoke grenade onto the LZ.

165
00:12:11.64 --> 00:12:16.44
This gesture was universally understood by everyone who supported Saga to signal that

166
00:12:16.44 --> 00:12:21.92
the team was safely out, the LZ clear and everyone else was free to pound the living

167
00:12:21.92 --> 00:12:24.84
daylights out of it.

168
00:12:24.84 --> 00:12:29.000
Their RT line was not home-free, not yet at least.

169
00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.92
Anti-aircraft rounds were bursting around them like a World War II Akak fire.

170
00:12:33.92 --> 00:12:38.64
Captain Onn was dipping and juking in an effort to judge the dodge the bursts and make

171
00:12:38.64 --> 00:12:40.92
himself harder to track.

172
00:12:40.92 --> 00:12:46.52
He still looked calm, cool, and collected as if he were making a routine flight.

173
00:12:46.52 --> 00:12:52.84
For these guys, Watkins, maybe this was a routine flight.

174
00:12:52.84 --> 00:12:58.56
In the king be touched down a case on, Tassada, Godwin, and the grinning door gunner walked

175
00:12:58.56 --> 00:13:02.36
around poking their fingers into bullet holes and counting them.

176
00:13:02.36 --> 00:13:04.76
But they soon gave up.

177
00:13:04.76 --> 00:13:06.20
There were too many.

178
00:13:06.20 --> 00:13:13.84
In besides it was just too unsettling, unsettling to contemplate what might have been.

179
00:13:13.84 --> 00:13:19.68
Watkins learned later that Captain Onn had chosen to fly solo in the Oscar eight because

180
00:13:19.68 --> 00:13:23.32
he knew exactly how dangerous this mission was.

181
00:13:23.32 --> 00:13:31.000
He'd lost King Bees there before and was determined not to risk more lives than necessary.

182
00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:36.52
He figured if the gods were damed that his ship go down while trying to save RT line,

183
00:13:36.52 --> 00:13:40.56
it would just be him and the door gunner.

184
00:13:40.56 --> 00:13:43.80
It seemed like a simple and perfectly logical decision.

185
00:13:43.80 --> 00:13:46.80
No big deal.

186
00:13:46.80 --> 00:13:51.12
Incredibly everyone who participated in the mission was alive and well.

187
00:13:51.12 --> 00:13:56.88
But men of RT line were home, seasoned veterans of Oscar eight.

188
00:13:56.88 --> 00:14:06.60
It had indeed been there time after all.

189
00:14:06.60 --> 00:14:18.56
So that is a whole different kind of heroism.

190
00:14:18.56 --> 00:14:24.20
Because look when you're on the ground, in many cases you don't even have a choice,

191
00:14:24.20 --> 00:14:26.56
but to be a hero.

192
00:14:26.56 --> 00:14:31.36
You either step up or you die.

193
00:14:31.36 --> 00:14:42.40
But for these pilots, men like Captain Onn, they don't really have to do anything heroic.

194
00:14:42.40 --> 00:14:45.56
They could easily say that the landing zones too hot or they've already been shot or

195
00:14:45.56 --> 00:14:51.72
the low on fuel or whatever.

196
00:14:51.72 --> 00:14:54.24
But they're safe in their aircraft.

197
00:14:54.24 --> 00:14:59.92
And they see the hell that is going on and they see the hell that they are going into.

198
00:14:59.92 --> 00:15:07.44
They call it's and rockets and anti-aircraft and they go anyway.

199
00:15:07.44 --> 00:15:10.48
They go anyway.

200
00:15:10.48 --> 00:15:18.56
Men like Captain Noin Key Arn, a pilot in the South Vietnamese Air Force who flew countless

201
00:15:18.56 --> 00:15:24.96
missions in saintly dangerous missions in support of American and South Vietnamese

202
00:15:24.96 --> 00:15:33.48
sog teams. These are recipient of the silver star and the distinguished flying cross.

203
00:15:33.48 --> 00:15:39.000
And it is an absolute honor to have Captain Onn with us here to talk about his experience

204
00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:44.72
in fighting in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia.

205
00:15:44.72 --> 00:15:49.72
Captain Onn, it's an absolute honor to have here.

206
00:15:49.72 --> 00:15:58.60
But I guess also joining us once again is John Strike or Meyer, till Special Forces member

207
00:15:58.60 --> 00:16:01.60
of Sog who has been on this podcast before.

208
00:16:01.60 --> 00:16:09.56
Couple times 180, 1801, 1802, 1806 with the Frenchman, 247, 248 and the last one with

209
00:16:09.56 --> 00:16:10.56
cowboy con.

210
00:16:10.56 --> 00:16:11.56
Cowboys.

211
00:16:11.56 --> 00:16:14.56
258 back again.

212
00:16:14.56 --> 00:16:16.92
Thank you so much.

213
00:16:16.92 --> 00:16:23.68
And when you first came on after the first couple times people started asking almost immediately

214
00:16:23.68 --> 00:16:27.48
to if I could find a king bee pilot.

215
00:16:27.48 --> 00:16:32.84
And I know as soon as you very quickly mentioned Captain Onn.

216
00:16:32.84 --> 00:16:34.20
Always.

217
00:16:34.20 --> 00:16:35.36
Number one king bee.

218
00:16:35.36 --> 00:16:36.36
For sure.

219
00:16:36.36 --> 00:16:39.000
Thank you.

220
00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.40
So on tell us about what it was like growing up.

221
00:16:42.40 --> 00:16:43.40
Where did you grow up?

222
00:16:43.40 --> 00:16:50.40
I would grow up at Hanway, not at Vietnam.

223
00:16:50.40 --> 00:16:56.88
My father decided to move to family to the South in 1954.

224
00:16:56.88 --> 00:17:00.32
That was after the French got beat.

225
00:17:00.32 --> 00:17:03.92
So did your father recognize the bad things could happen?

226
00:17:03.92 --> 00:17:04.92
Yes.

227
00:17:04.92 --> 00:17:07.28
And what did your father do for a living?

228
00:17:07.28 --> 00:17:14.28
Did you meet before in the 55th of the 54th?

229
00:17:14.28 --> 00:17:17.28
He has some kind of business to cut the lumber.

230
00:17:17.28 --> 00:17:19.28
Like a long ago.

231
00:17:19.28 --> 00:17:25.28
He high people to do it when he organized the office.

232
00:17:25.28 --> 00:17:34.28
And after the 54th we moved down to the South.

233
00:17:34.28 --> 00:17:40.000
They looked for one of the French company.

234
00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:41.000
He worked for a French company?

235
00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:42.000
Yes.

236
00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:43.000
Okay.

237
00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:44.000
After the 54th.

238
00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000
Then he moved to the South.

239
00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:47.000
Okay.

240
00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.000
And what did you do?

241
00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000
How old were you when you moved to the South?

242
00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.000
I was 15, 11.

243
00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:53.000
11 years old.

244
00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:54.000
Yeah.

245
00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:58.84
And my father sent my son and my brother.

246
00:17:58.84 --> 00:18:08.72
A young brother at that time, he was 10 and to try to with one of the French to the South.

247
00:18:08.72 --> 00:18:14.84
Now did you have any understanding of what was happening with the communist and North Vietnam?

248
00:18:14.84 --> 00:18:18.04
Did you have any understanding of that yet?

249
00:18:18.04 --> 00:18:28.48
Before we went to the South, then I remember.

250
00:18:28.48 --> 00:18:33.60
At night, I see the next to my father.

251
00:18:33.60 --> 00:18:42.000
He was a police officer, a police officer, a police officer, which he made because my

252
00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:49.96
brother, who was killed in 45.

253
00:18:49.96 --> 00:18:51.36
When he was 17.

254
00:18:51.36 --> 00:18:52.36
Okay.

255
00:18:52.36 --> 00:18:53.36
By the communist.

256
00:18:53.36 --> 00:18:54.36
The communist.

257
00:18:54.36 --> 00:18:55.36
Yeah.

258
00:18:55.36 --> 00:19:01.44
So, once you got down the South Vietnam, now you're 11 years old.

259
00:19:01.44 --> 00:19:03.32
And what did you do?

260
00:19:03.32 --> 00:19:04.72
Were you just going to school?

261
00:19:04.72 --> 00:19:06.56
Yes, I did.

262
00:19:06.56 --> 00:19:18.68
And since we moved around on the time, I know it to high funk and then go to the South.

263
00:19:18.68 --> 00:19:27.08
And my brother, next to me, we are on try to make a two great in one year.

264
00:19:27.08 --> 00:19:28.44
You try to make what in one year?

265
00:19:28.44 --> 00:19:29.44
Two great.

266
00:19:29.44 --> 00:19:30.44
Okay.

267
00:19:30.44 --> 00:19:33.44
Were you able to do it?

268
00:19:33.44 --> 00:19:34.44
Yeah.

269
00:19:34.44 --> 00:19:35.44
Okay.

270
00:19:35.44 --> 00:19:36.44
We did.

271
00:19:36.44 --> 00:19:37.44
Nice.

272
00:19:37.44 --> 00:19:37.44
Nice.

273
00:19:37.44 --> 00:19:41.12
And in 62.

274
00:19:41.12 --> 00:19:48.12
In 62, I was on the Air Force.

275
00:19:48.12 --> 00:19:54.20
My brother, he got a scholarship from Usham and he went here too.

276
00:19:54.20 --> 00:19:58.04
So 1962 is when you joined the Air Force.

277
00:19:58.04 --> 00:20:03.64
And once you joined the Air Force, did you know you were going to be a pilot?

278
00:20:03.64 --> 00:20:04.64
Yes.

279
00:20:04.64 --> 00:20:05.64
Okay.

280
00:20:05.64 --> 00:20:12.64
But I didn't believe that I would be.

281
00:20:12.64 --> 00:20:14.92
I couldn't ride the car, I couldn't ride air.

282
00:20:14.92 --> 00:20:18.88
You were there when you were even ever in a bus.

283
00:20:18.88 --> 00:20:24.88
Because every time I got in the car, my stomach was like, come up to my mouth.

284
00:20:24.88 --> 00:20:26.88
You're a car, sir.

285
00:20:26.88 --> 00:20:28.88
Chaucic train, sir.

286
00:20:28.88 --> 00:20:29.88
Every day.

287
00:20:29.88 --> 00:20:30.88
Here we get.

288
00:20:30.88 --> 00:20:32.84
Yeah, that's not fun.

289
00:20:32.84 --> 00:20:34.84
But eventually you were able to get over that?

290
00:20:34.84 --> 00:20:35.84
Yes.

291
00:20:35.84 --> 00:20:45.36
The first time I'm my IP, he demonstrated the engine quit all the oral total tasting.

292
00:20:45.36 --> 00:20:50.04
And I feel my stomach is coming up.

293
00:20:50.04 --> 00:20:53.60
I can't hear how can I fly.

294
00:20:53.60 --> 00:20:55.92
But they are on, I get used with it.

295
00:20:55.92 --> 00:20:56.92
Right.

296
00:20:56.92 --> 00:21:00.20
And I like it.

297
00:21:00.20 --> 00:21:03.16
I know that they have something for American pilots.

298
00:21:03.16 --> 00:21:04.60
And I don't know if they made you do this.

299
00:21:04.60 --> 00:21:08.48
They have something where if you get air sickness, they have something I think it's in

300
00:21:08.48 --> 00:21:09.48
taxes.

301
00:21:09.48 --> 00:21:11.24
It's called Spin and Puk.

302
00:21:11.24 --> 00:21:15.36
And they basically put you in this machine every day and it spins you around and makes

303
00:21:15.36 --> 00:21:17.96
you sick until you get used to it.

304
00:21:17.96 --> 00:21:18.96
Really?

305
00:21:18.96 --> 00:21:19.96
Yep.

306
00:21:19.96 --> 00:21:22.88
So I guess you didn't do that.

307
00:21:22.88 --> 00:21:23.88
No.

308
00:21:23.88 --> 00:21:26.88
You didn't have to go to the Spin and Puk.

309
00:21:26.88 --> 00:21:29.24
One auto rotation helps.

310
00:21:29.24 --> 00:21:36.24
So how long were you in the Air Force before you started training to become a pilot?

311
00:21:36.24 --> 00:21:51.64
When I was in Air Force in late 1962, and formerly it was on the very first of the 63.

312
00:21:51.64 --> 00:21:59.20
I was having the basic terminally training in the Nya Shank for the ESI-off course.

313
00:21:59.20 --> 00:22:02.20
So for six months.

314
00:22:02.20 --> 00:22:12.04
And in Zurai, 63, I was sent here to get a tiny.

315
00:22:12.04 --> 00:22:13.44
So you came to America?

316
00:22:13.44 --> 00:22:17.68
Yeah, and got the ESI-algan training in the industry.

317
00:22:17.68 --> 00:22:18.68
In the San Antonio.

318
00:22:18.68 --> 00:22:19.68
Okay.

319
00:22:19.68 --> 00:22:26.20
So you go to San Antonio to first of all, how to speak English?

320
00:22:26.20 --> 00:22:29.20
Oh, in Vietnam.

321
00:22:29.20 --> 00:22:30.20
Okay.

322
00:22:30.20 --> 00:22:38.68
When I kept the ability to be literally training and the ESI-al in English training for

323
00:22:38.68 --> 00:22:47.84
six months, and then when I went to the San Antonio Tigers, another four months for

324
00:22:47.84 --> 00:22:56.16
ESL in English, in English, after that I went to four waters in Texas.

325
00:22:56.16 --> 00:22:57.16
Okay.

326
00:22:57.16 --> 00:22:58.16
And what was the first one?

327
00:22:58.16 --> 00:22:59.16
The first one was for?

328
00:22:59.16 --> 00:23:02.16
Probably, how do you go to training?

329
00:23:02.16 --> 00:23:03.16
Okay.

330
00:23:03.16 --> 00:23:06.16
Is the ESI-algan training three?

331
00:23:06.16 --> 00:23:07.16
The ESI-23.

332
00:23:07.16 --> 00:23:08.16
The ESI-23.

333
00:23:08.16 --> 00:23:09.16
The ESI-23.

334
00:23:09.16 --> 00:23:12.16
It's small and ugly.

335
00:23:12.16 --> 00:23:15.16
That's like the bubble canopy, right?

336
00:23:15.16 --> 00:23:16.16
Simultaneously.

337
00:23:16.16 --> 00:23:19.16
Yeah, it's a very, very old one.

338
00:23:19.16 --> 00:23:27.16
And then, so how long did you spend in America training the fly?

339
00:23:27.16 --> 00:23:37.72
From the first training, I had the advanced training on ESI-23, to then after

340
00:23:37.72 --> 00:23:44.000
happiness, I went to Alabama to get the training on the ESL-24.

341
00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:45.000
The Kingby.

342
00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:46.000
The Kingby.

343
00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:48.000
What was your first impression of the Kingby?

344
00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:49.000
It was big.

345
00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:53.000
Because it was from the ESI-23.

346
00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:54.000
It was small one.

347
00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:56.000
It was training one.

348
00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:09.000
And when I finished the training on the ESI-24, I was thankful to get the training on the

349
00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:10.000
Huey.

350
00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:13.000
At that time, they only have the school.

351
00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:15.000
They only have the A model.

352
00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:18.000
It's a smaller one.

353
00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:19.000
The A model Huey?

354
00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:20.000
Yeah.

355
00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:21.000
What did you like better?

356
00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.000
The Huey or the Kingby?

357
00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.000
It's a kidney.

358
00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:27.000
It's a kidney.

359
00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:28.000
It had the Bail.

360
00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:33.000
At that time, it was about 150 hundred house power.

361
00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:36.000
But the Huey wasn't A model.

362
00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:40.000
He was only 900 house power.

363
00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:43.000
But the Huey is a lot smaller than the Kingby.

364
00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:46.000
Yes, it is small.

365
00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:48.000
But did you feel like you had more power in the Kingby?

366
00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:49.000
No.

367
00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:50.000
No.

368
00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:51.000
Because it's too easy.

369
00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:53.000
Too easy to fry.

370
00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:55.000
What's that one?

371
00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:05.000
Because on the ESI-24, I got told about how it's.

372
00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:06.000
How many hours?

373
00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:07.000
Hundred hours.

374
00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:09.000
Wow.

375
00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:14.000
But on the Huey, I only had the 900 hours.

376
00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:15.000
Okay.

377
00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:21.000
And the pilot, Captain Bylode, who checked me, he said,

378
00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:22.000
Okay.

379
00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:23.000
He's a good stay home.

380
00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:26.000
You don't need to fry anymore.

381
00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:27.000
He's the home.

382
00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:30.000
He can have more time to take out of people.

383
00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:31.000
God.

384
00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:33.000
Other people don't learn as quickly as he did.

385
00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:34.000
God.

386
00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:38.000
So I was awful one week and this girl ran.

387
00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:43.000
So then, so is that what you got trained in?

388
00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:45.000
You completed all that training.

389
00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:48.000
And then it was going back to Vietnam.

390
00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:51.000
Yes, in the 61.

391
00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:54.000
Around the Zoolai 64.

392
00:25:54.000 --> 00:26:03.000
So in 64 America's there, but not super heavy engaged in combat operations yet.

393
00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:05.000
What was it like when you got back?

394
00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:08.000
Were you starting to anticipate?

395
00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:13.000
Were you starting to seem like there was going to be a broader war being fought there?

396
00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:19.60
Don't forget, June on 1964, Roger Dollen, earned the first Medal of Honor at a Green

397
00:26:19.60 --> 00:26:21.000
Brey camp.

398
00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:26.000
So there were major battles at the A camps, at that level.

399
00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:30.000
And so, and the course that King Bees, even then, were supporting somebody at the A camps.

400
00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:34.000
So that was the beginning of that war at a serious level.

401
00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:38.000
And yes, we didn't get the American troops involved to hydranny Valley, but they began to build up

402
00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:40.000
the Marines came into today.

403
00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.000
So he was all part of that.

404
00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.000
What year did the Marines come into the day?

405
00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:45.000
There was 64 I think.

406
00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:47.000
Yes, 64, 64, 64, 64.

407
00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:51.000
Yeah, because it's always hydrang in 65.

408
00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:57.000
That sort of, in my mind, marks the beginning of like heavy American combat operations.

409
00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:02.000
Yes, it has a formal battle between American first cab and the NVA.

410
00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:08.000
So, but yeah, definitely prior to that, it was advisors in their working by-with-and-through

411
00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.000
the locals.

412
00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:11.000
Right.

413
00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:13.000
And yeah.

414
00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:15.000
So you are seeing all that happen.

415
00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.000
You're seeing that start to unfold.

416
00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:23.000
Where you, at what point did you start flying the King Bees in support of special operations?

417
00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:31.000
When I first came back from the U.S. training, I was assigned to the...

418
00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:34.000
2017 squad.

419
00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:39.000
And the 2017 squad, the first station at Saigon.

420
00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:48.000
And in the 60, later 65, was moved to Cantel in the south.

421
00:27:48.000 --> 00:28:00.000
And in February, 1966, I was assigned to the 80-thirds of the military.

422
00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:03.000
The 80-thirds group.

423
00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:11.000
This is the group that combine face-wing and helicopter to verify the sacred mission.

424
00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:20.000
And later on, the helicopter-through group become a two-nineteen.

425
00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:25.000
But the group of the 80, the helicopter group in 80-thirds,

426
00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:30.000
and it's basically a heavy-fledged helicopter.

427
00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:37.000
But when we become, became the two-nineteen, we have about 34 of them.

428
00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:40.000
Did you know what you were getting into?

429
00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:41.000
Yeah.

430
00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:42.000
Were those kind of...

431
00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:44.000
I like it.

432
00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:46.000
And because he's very modest.

433
00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:49.000
The first two years, basically, from...

434
00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:55.000
He went to the first the 2017, the commander that didn't like North Vietnamese.

435
00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:57.000
So he was only a cop-out.

436
00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:58.000
But he applied cop-out.

437
00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:00.000
He gave very bored, he wants more action.

438
00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.000
So he finally gets to be questioned.

439
00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:07.000
And he goes and gets the action.

440
00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:11.000
So once you started doing that, what was that like?

441
00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:18.000
What was it like to start going out on those operations where there was all this incredible intensity on the ground?

442
00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:26.000
Oh, I think he's more excited than in a normal squad.

443
00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:31.000
Yeah, I'd say it's probably more exciting than in a normal squadron.

444
00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:34.000
Oh, dude.

445
00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:39.000
What was the operational pace like?

446
00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:42.000
How often were you getting called to fly?

447
00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:43.000
What would happen?

448
00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:47.000
Would you be on standby waiting to go extract people?

449
00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:50.000
Would you sit and plan with the guys from SOG?

450
00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:52.000
So you all were working together?

451
00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:55.000
How did all that work?

452
00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:56.000
Everything.

453
00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.000
I woke up like that.

454
00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.000
Because they had a rotation.

455
00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:04.000
Like one week they would be on assignment, one week they'd be training.

456
00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:06.000
And another week they'd be getting ready.

457
00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:08.000
And then one week or so they'd be on a side.

458
00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:09.000
They could be able to food by.

459
00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:10.000
Yeah.

460
00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:11.000
Then they go down a contone.

461
00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:15.000
Wherever the most bending on a weather, what missions were up.

462
00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:20.000
So would SOG ground guys go and, you know, would you sit down and say, okay,

463
00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:21.000
here's where we're going to insert.

464
00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:22.000
Here's where we go up, order.

465
00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:24.000
And they would be in for the briefing.

466
00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:25.000
Practing on.

467
00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:29.000
Before we went out to the operation that we have the briefing.

468
00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:34.000
What we are going to do and where we are going to work.

469
00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:41.000
But since I was also familiar with the whole board from

470
00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:49.000
Hesign down to Praco, Mami to the whole water around the island.

471
00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:51.000
And always the whole team in 12.

472
00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:53.000
I'm so familiar with it.

473
00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:54.000
I just, yeah.

474
00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:56.000
I don't need to bring map.

475
00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:58.000
You were that familiar with it.

476
00:30:58.000 --> 00:30:59.000
Yeah.

477
00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:00.000
Here's another thing.

478
00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:04.000
During those briefings, when they're there as a one zero,

479
00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:07.000
the king bees, as we went further into the war,

480
00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:11.000
we were saying we found 23 mic mic here.

481
00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:15.000
37 mic anti-aircraft weaponry in those targets.

482
00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:19.000
So they would tell the cubby and their expertise would be another bonus

483
00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:21.000
that we had in terms of our briefing.

484
00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:23.000
We're not the fly.

485
00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:25.000
That's one of the briefing parts.

486
00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:27.000
So it's like we hear what the mission was.

487
00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:28.000
Get that from S3.

488
00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:32.000
But we'd always hear from them than the cubby after that.

489
00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:34.000
Oh yeah.

490
00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:39.000
So you'd be flying basically some kind of combat mission every day

491
00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:41.000
or two days, three days at the most.

492
00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:45.000
Oh, sometimes in one day we are through a three mission.

493
00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:52.000
It's mission last about less than two hours.

494
00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:53.000
Yeah.

495
00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:55.000
Yeah, see, that's what's cool about being a pilot, right?

496
00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:58.000
Two hours, you know, two hours in your dog.

497
00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:01.000
If you live to come home, you're going to have to come home.

498
00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:03.000
You're doing all right.

499
00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:06.000
You're back eating good shall and drinking a cold beer.

500
00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:07.000
Indeed.

501
00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:15.000
So how long did it take before you finally ended up getting shot down?

502
00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:17.000
Ooh.

503
00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:18.000
They should get.

504
00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:21.000
Like when did I know you ended up getting shot down?

505
00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:24.000
How long were you flying for before you got shot down for the first time?

506
00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:25.000
Over four years.

507
00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:26.000
Over four years.

508
00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:27.000
Over five years.

509
00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:28.000
Over five years.

510
00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:33.000
Over seven times.

511
00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:34.000
I don't remember.

512
00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:37.000
Because I was at that point high at four times.

513
00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:39.000
And I was at that point four times.

514
00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:40.000
Yeah.

515
00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:41.000
I don't remember.

516
00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:44.000
I don't even remember which day we were at that.

517
00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:46.000
I said the last time I lost my hand.

518
00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:48.000
Can you remember that?

519
00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:49.000
Yeah.

520
00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:50.000
The first time you got shot.

521
00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:51.000
You don't really remember what happened.

522
00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:52.000
The first time you got shot down.

523
00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:53.000
Oh.

524
00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:59.000
The first time I was shot down was in south of the Mabu mountain.

525
00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:04.000
And in the morning we suppose to take the.

526
00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:11.000
They put to make the security line south of the Mabu mountain.

527
00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:14.000
And in Marble, Mabu, right where F would be four was.

528
00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:16.000
So this is the in country mission.

529
00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:19.000
And they're picking up a batting to put it on the south side of Marble, Mabu.

530
00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:22.000
Because F would be four was on a north side.

531
00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:23.000
And they were having some issues.

532
00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:26.000
They put the batting out there for security purposes.

533
00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:29.000
The work and the long with the Marines at that point.

534
00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:31.000
And so something clocked in the morning.

535
00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:32.000
South Vietnam.

536
00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:34.000
He gets shot down.

537
00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:35.000
Yeah.

538
00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:36.000
Yeah.

539
00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:38.000
And I will now at sea so clock.

540
00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:41.000
And in South the.

541
00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:43.000
I'm a drop the.

542
00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:44.000
The two.

543
00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:48.000
And when the second king, the land.

544
00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:50.000
And he said that he kept.

545
00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:52.000
He kept. He caught the.

546
00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:53.000
The ground fine.

547
00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:55.000
And I told him.

548
00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:57.000
Remember which way.

549
00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:59.000
And.

550
00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:00.000
And I come back to.

551
00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:02.000
Mabu mountain pick up more people.

552
00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:05.000
And then land again.

553
00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:07.000
And I see which.

554
00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:09.000
Which direction is that.

555
00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:11.000
He said to a clock.

556
00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:13.000
And I take up and have to two two.

557
00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:14.000
A couple of.

558
00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:15.000
A little direction.

559
00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:18.000
And I saw a line of the people.

560
00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:20.000
And I was moving.

561
00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:21.000
With the.

562
00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:22.000
I was.

563
00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:25.000
I was a woman and she got killed.

564
00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:26.000
And with the.

565
00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:28.000
But you know, Mabu too much.

566
00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:29.000
The carry.

567
00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:30.000
Yes.

568
00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:30.000
Yeah.

569
00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:32.000
And I told the.

570
00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:33.000
The.

571
00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:34.000
The.

572
00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:35.000
The.

573
00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:36.000
The people.

574
00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:37.000
The civilian people.

575
00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:38.000
The.

576
00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:39.000
The.

577
00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:39.000
The.

578
00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:39.000
The.

579
00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:41.000
And as long as I.

580
00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:42.000
I.

581
00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:43.000
I.

582
00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:44.000
I.

583
00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:45.000
A.

584
00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:45.000
A.

585
00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:46.000
A.

586
00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:47.000
Long.

587
00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:49.000
The.

588
00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:59.000
But the.

589
00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:00.000
The.

590
00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:03.000
And.

591
00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:05.000
The.

592
00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:06.000
The third shop.

593
00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:07.000
The.

594
00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:06.000
The.

595
00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:11.000
People were fake.

596
00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:12.000
During.

597
00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:14.000
XV.

598
00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:19.000
I was like, wow, wow, again, to take the child back.

599
00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:22.000
And we took the child back.

600
00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:27.000
The mechanic couldn't find any round.

601
00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:35.000
So, we keep asking me, tell them, tell them, tell them,

602
00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:38.000
what happened, what really happened.

603
00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:45.000
We couldn't find any round, then it must be the technical problem.

604
00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:52.000
I said, yes, I heard the round earlier, it was fire.

605
00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:58.000
Later, in the afternoon, one of the mechanic ships,

606
00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:06.000
he opened the Fondar of the engine.

607
00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:10.000
He looked around.

608
00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:19.000
Suddenly, he saw the cap of the needle.

609
00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:21.000
That was the whole thing.

610
00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:23.000
That was it.

611
00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:26.000
He was wondering, why is it this?

612
00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:29.000
That is the whole thing.

613
00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:31.000
The people didn't change it.

614
00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:35.000
So, he could call the mechanic and open it.

615
00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:38.000
My wallet was in there.

616
00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:41.000
And that makes it harder to ignite it.

617
00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:46.000
So, you would go back out and you went back out and recovered that aircraft?

618
00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:47.000
Yeah.

619
00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:51.000
Would you tie straps onto it and bring it back or how to do it?

620
00:36:51.000 --> 00:37:00.000
I go, go out and we did to sew them, how to bring it down the aircraft back.

621
00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:02.000
Would you bring it back with another helicopter?

622
00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:03.000
Yeah.

623
00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:06.000
Tie it on and bring it back and then start working on it.

624
00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:09.000
Did you feel jinks to go back in that aircraft again?

625
00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:10.000
Yeah.

626
00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:13.000
Like, you don't know.

627
00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:15.000
Or did you feel lucky?

628
00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:18.000
You already got shot down, you made it.

629
00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:20.000
You don't win.

630
00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:24.000
I was in the rice paddy.

631
00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:32.000
I saw the amount of the chocolate and the amount of the I'm turning.

632
00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:36.000
The old one, the old two, remember seeing that.

633
00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:41.000
And then my true shape, bring a little bit of candy, the arm of the box.

634
00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:46.000
And my co-pie, he ran along with me.

635
00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:53.000
When I went back to the I'm literally, I looked back and I saw the one.

636
00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:57.000
The water on the rice paddy was fairly done.

637
00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:01.000
Because in the front day they were sweating from the wheelies.

638
00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:02.000
Oh, yeah.

639
00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:03.000
Still.

640
00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:13.000
And then to the bottom of the rice paddy and put it again with the machine gunner and loaded and I shot it.

641
00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:15.000
I got idiot, worked.

642
00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:18.000
Only one round in the time.

643
00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:25.000
I didn't want to see it.

644
00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:27.000
It was all 30 calories.

645
00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:31.000
We're not the most reliable after the first 30 years of combat.

646
00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:39.000
I know there's another story where you got shot down again after.

647
00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:45.000
And the day before, King B had been shot down and then you went into, what happened on that operation?

648
00:38:45.000 --> 00:39:00.000
The day before we went out and to be surprised and bring the wound from the team.

649
00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:05.000
And I ran and picked up some, and I resuppied some.

650
00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:09.000
The second one, let's hide there by the RPC.

651
00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:16.000
And it was about 5 p.m.

652
00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:27.000
And when they saw it, I came back to the back toe.

653
00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:31.000
And now we lost two things every time.

654
00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:35.000
Yeah, two things on the previous day.

655
00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:43.000
And I decided, how did you feel about going on an operation when there was two King B shot down the day before?

656
00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:48.000
And now you have to go back in there. What did that feel like?

657
00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:56.000
I think that we need to bring the honor by friend, right?

658
00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:09.000
And when I went to an doctor, the radio man from the camp, he went out and he said,

659
00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:12.000
all the from side gone, no two men anymore.

660
00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:21.000
And he lowered his spine, but the last decision is yours.

661
00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:26.000
And I said, oh, I'm going to go again.

662
00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:34.000
And I asked it to go V and the two Renship and my number three, number four.

663
00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:48.000
King B. I will go in again and when we were about, yeah, I told him,

664
00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:58.000
that's a follow me. And when we were about five kilometers from the L.D.

665
00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:01.000
then you people were just updating.

666
00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:04.000
And I will go now by myself.

667
00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:13.000
And I wait until 7 o'clock, a 7 p.m. is dark.

668
00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:19.000
And I say, let's go. And I turn out on my light.

669
00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:23.000
Even the last one, light.

670
00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:25.000
Turn them off. Turn them off.

671
00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:28.000
Very, very, very, very, very faint.

672
00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:30.000
How to see it.

673
00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:36.000
And because anyway, for a far, far, far, long, high,

674
00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:45.000
far, I can listen to the engine and know how much data it was working.

675
00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:49.000
And how much I know how many L.P.M. is running.

676
00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:51.000
I can listen to it.

677
00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:57.000
And when you were about five kilometers from the L.D.

678
00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:03.000
I turned off the light and tell other people to a little bit wait for me.

679
00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:07.000
And I asked the Kobi, do you see me?

680
00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:11.000
And he said that, yes.

681
00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:18.000
So I turned off the engine and go down, go down to the top or to three.

682
00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:21.000
Rikovil. And I see him again.

683
00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:24.000
Do you see me? And he said, yes.

684
00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:26.000
Okay, guide me.

685
00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:30.000
And you guys tell the light, light, light, light.

686
00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:41.000
And the L.D.R. had and make a 360 with a 90, 90, not go my 360 degree to land on the L.D.

687
00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:47.000
So they were walking you in and telling the Kobi was telling you to tell the Kobi was telling me.

688
00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:49.000
Guide me.

689
00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:50.000
Yeah.

690
00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:52.000
At night.

691
00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:54.000
At three top.

692
00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:57.000
In the jungle, this is in the mountains here.

693
00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:01.000
It's not like for flying a camp, booty, where it's flat.

694
00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:09.000
He's flying over the hills to just, and that's just part of one another day with a king be pile at night.

695
00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:10.000
With the lights out.

696
00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:12.000
And he got to everybody out.

697
00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:14.000
Mm-hmm.

698
00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:19.000
And the next day, I came in again.

699
00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:23.000
And at the 10 am.

700
00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:26.000
And when I was ticking off.

701
00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:31.000
And I heard a big brush.

702
00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:37.000
And they said, the chopper started to make up.

703
00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:40.000
Because the engine was last.

704
00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:42.000
The brush broke up.

705
00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:43.000
Yeah, broke up.

706
00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:44.000
We broke up the engine.

707
00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:46.000
Wait, what broke up the engine?

708
00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:47.000
Yeah, they didn't fire.

709
00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:50.000
It was hit by the RPE.

710
00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:52.000
Okay, guide me the phone.

711
00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:57.000
Yeah.

712
00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:02.000
I make it the right move to keep the joppers.

713
00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:06.000
Go stick to the side of the hill.

714
00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:10.000
And still, I'm a start-of-the-loaded road.

715
00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:16.000
I load the left side down to a so it can hold on the side of the hill.

716
00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:19.000
And it's just mud.

717
00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:31.000
And I say that the koppai, when I come out, I get koppai.

718
00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:33.000
He always on my other left eye.

719
00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:35.000
And I said, the run.

720
00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:36.000
So let's do the next.

721
00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:37.000
I get this.

722
00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:40.000
Your aircraft gets hit with an RPG.

723
00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:41.000
Yeah.

724
00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:42.000
The engine dies.

725
00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:43.000
The engine came off.

726
00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:44.000
The engine came off.

727
00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:46.000
Yeah, it blew off the engine.

728
00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:47.000
Okay.

729
00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:51.000
So now the chopper goes nose up.

730
00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:52.000
Yeah.

731
00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:55.000
You're going to crash land and you have to do it on a hillside.

732
00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:55.000
Yeah.

733
00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:59.000
And so you had to maneuver the helicopter to be at the angle.

734
00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:00.000
Yeah.

735
00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:03.000
So you won't be falling a little road out of the hill.

736
00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:05.000
And then, so you land it.

737
00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:08.000
Basically, you are able to crash land it.

738
00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:12.000
And then you look your koppai and say, run.

739
00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:15.000
And then have to heal up.

740
00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:18.000
Okay.

741
00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:21.000
So you then you joined the de-sag team on the ground.

742
00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:22.000
Yes.

743
00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:25.000
Did you charge the M30 again for good luck?

744
00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:26.000
No.

745
00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:29.000
At that time, we, I'll hit him 60.

746
00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:30.000
Okay.

747
00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:32.000
So you got the M60 off of it?

748
00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:33.000
Yeah.

749
00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:34.000
Yeah.

750
00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:37.000
So then what happened when you joined up with the de-sag team?

751
00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:42.000
The south team, because of the M60 and M18 was...

752
00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:46.000
All over the, the, the, the dish.

753
00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:50.000
And I, I wrapped one of them.

754
00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:51.000
No.

755
00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:53.000
At first I, yeah.

756
00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:56.000
I ended up one of them tried to shoot.

757
00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:59.000
And, who are the de-sag team from?

758
00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:04.000
But the, the, the Indian work, because they shoot,

759
00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:08.000
he shot all of them and the de-sag.

760
00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:11.000
They, uh, ran out of both.

761
00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:13.000
Yeah.

762
00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:17.000
Uh, I think they, uh, they're going to shoot the right.

763
00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:19.000
Oh, the gun was too dry.

764
00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:20.000
Yeah.

765
00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:21.000
I'll go to the shoot and then walk.

766
00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:22.000
Okay.

767
00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:26.000
So now you're in a perimeter, I guess, with your team, with the team.

768
00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:27.000
They're wounded.

769
00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:28.000
Yeah.

770
00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:30.000
And this is a wounded people who had picked that team.

771
00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:31.000
What team was this?

772
00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:32.000
I'm not sure.

773
00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:33.000
Sout a cartoon.

774
00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:36.000
This is before my time, even like, 67.

775
00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:37.000
I think.

776
00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:41.000
So I, I ran around and, uh, in five, and all the, uh,

777
00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:43.000
I'm, uh, 179 again.

778
00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:44.000
Mm-hmm.

779
00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:45.000
And 28-large.

780
00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:47.000
Two-baked, of the, and it, and it.

781
00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:48.000
So I just, okay.

782
00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:51.000
You should, may now, I'll be, uh, maybe, I did, maybe, maybe to you.

783
00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:55.000
I should, I should, I should, I should, I, I am the two-baked,

784
00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:57.000
I will, uh, am until the day.

785
00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:06.000
And, uh, I, uh, I should have been from 15 meters away from us to 200 meters away from us.

786
00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:10.000
Yeah, how long were you guys on the ground for before you got extracted?

787
00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:11.000
Oh.

788
00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:16.000
And, uh, when I, uh, after, after I started on a degree,

789
00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:19.000
I, uh, called the decovi.

790
00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:23.000
And, uh, he said, you still like, yeah, I still got that.

791
00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:29.000
And I called my rescue pilot because he, he's, he was on the sky.

792
00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:33.000
And he saw the, he said that he, he saw the, uh, the frame,

793
00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:38.000
the line of frame, the row, he, and hit my, uh, chopper and my chopper, I spoke,

794
00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:43.000
you know, the front row, I spoke and he thought that I was not that.

795
00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:49.000
But, like, he, he was not that, and he said, oh, you still like, I see him,

796
00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:51.000
but don't let it in the wall.

797
00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:53.000
We have to move.

798
00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:57.000
Yeah, so here, if that had been a U.E., they're dead.

799
00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:59.000
Everybody's dead, but that's a kingby.

800
00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:01.000
Yeah, the U.E. and the R.P.G.

801
00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:05.000
Hit the engine and blew it out, which is a nine cylinder World War Two engine

802
00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:08.000
from the B-17, but blew it out to aircraft, and he still,

803
00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:11.000
they will talk about it, walk away from it.

804
00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:13.000
Yeah, and crash land that thing.

805
00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:15.000
On the, on the sideways on the hill.

806
00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:17.000
Yeah.

807
00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:23.000
So, so was the, uh, the other aircraft, the other kingby then land and pick you guys up quickly

808
00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:24.000
or were you out there for a while?

809
00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:27.000
No, we have to, well, we have to run away from the,

810
00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:35.000
away from the L.Z. with the, with the team on 10 a.m. to HOP-M before I was bigger.

811
00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:37.000
So much for the two hour mission.

812
00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:39.000
Six hour six hour.

813
00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:43.000
And you're getting shot up by the NVA the whole time?

814
00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:44.000
Yeah, many times.

815
00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:48.000
And he's learning how to shoot the M79 in between the M16 and the M60,

816
00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:50.000
whatever around the has.

817
00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:54.000
On the job training in lay us.

818
00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:58.000
She's. So then you come back from that mission.

819
00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:03.000
And then take a shower, get ready, and go brief another mission.

820
00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:05.000
That's what you guys did.

821
00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:07.000
No, after having the mission that I was saw down,

822
00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:12.000
I went back to the, uh, Rob did back to Dr.

823
00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:16.000
And at that time, all of my commander, my squad, the man and the whole staff,

824
00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:19.000
I'll just go out and came down to Dr.

825
00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:21.000
To see what happened.

826
00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:24.000
And it couldn't believe you're still alive.

827
00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:25.000
And yeah.

828
00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:32.000
And when I first, when I first see my, my squad and go man,

829
00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:37.000
I said that my five need to have one week to,

830
00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:41.000
I'm big from a verification to relax.

831
00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:42.000
Did you give it to you?

832
00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:44.000
Yeah, he said, okay.

833
00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:48.000
So all you had to do is take a RPG hit, have your engine blown out,

834
00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:53.000
crash land and do a six hour gun fight with the NVA to get a week's vacation.

835
00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:58.000
I don't know. That seems like a rough tour.

836
00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:02.000
But the, the previous day, one of the job,

837
00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:09.000
I also got him by the RPG and the co-pilot, got killed.

838
00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:17.000
And the pilot and the, and the, and the mechanic and the delicious.

839
00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:20.000
I've burned, burned, burned, burned.

840
00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:22.000
I, I burned from the home.

841
00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:23.000
Yeah.

842
00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:24.000
Yeah.

843
00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:29.000
And then before the, the next day, before I left the housing,

844
00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:32.000
I went back to the,

845
00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:34.000
the last standing of the,

846
00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:36.000
the, the shop at the Wada,

847
00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:42.000
the, yes, of the, the previously and try to look for something.

848
00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:48.000
The, it's, it's, it's, it's got no remain of the co-pilot of the playlist day.

849
00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:51.000
But I couldn't find any.

850
00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:53.000
The whole thing was the,

851
00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:56.000
why us, because the,

852
00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:58.000
the, a club was the aluminum.

853
00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:00.000
Oh, so it just burned.

854
00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:02.000
It's just burned.

855
00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:03.000
Hmm.

856
00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:10.000
That, that wasn't your last time getting shot down.

857
00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:11.000
No, no, no, no.

858
00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:16.000
What about your tail row tail row getting shot off?

859
00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:19.000
Oh, tail row till the little cable.

860
00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:23.000
Um, it was in the house.

861
00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:25.000
And I was taken off.

862
00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:30.000
And suddenly I feel somebody hit my,

863
00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:33.000
on my, my food, on my feet.

864
00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:35.000
I've been, I've been.

865
00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:37.000
And I asked my,

866
00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:39.000
to bring it out, to thiswald,

867
00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:40.000
If you, you know,

868
00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:41.000
it came down the table.

869
00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:43.000
So there was a lot more than the peculiarity,

870
00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:44.000
certificates.

871
00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:46.000
Those line, guess what?

872
00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:47.000
What the,

873
00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:47.90
sum we Chaepp,

874
00:51:47.90 --> 00:51:50.000
whole finishes from here?

875
00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:50.98
Is certainly.

876
00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:52.000
Yeap Luke?

877
00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:53.000
Y 이거?

878
00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:54.000
The show.

879
00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:55.50
Saw, um,

880
00:51:55.50 --> 00:51:57.000
of this 질문.

881
00:51:57.000 --> 00:51:59.06
Well, we got to go in the room in the other去了

882
00:51:59.06 --> 00:52:01.54
because programming is the specialty solution,

883
00:52:01.54 --> 00:52:02.82
but in our table.

884
00:52:02.82 --> 00:52:05.02
Well, the coaching could be Andrew with the tower's house.

885
00:52:05.02 --> 00:52:06.50
But we had to calculate that.

886
00:52:06.50 --> 00:52:10.50
I did the job, but when I was taking it off,

887
00:52:10.50 --> 00:52:13.50
the job was done to turn right,

888
00:52:13.50 --> 00:52:16.50
because we don't have the control retail

889
00:52:16.50 --> 00:52:18.50
to remove the recycling to the left

890
00:52:18.50 --> 00:52:20.50
and reduce the power.

891
00:52:20.50 --> 00:52:23.50
And except I accept to be shot

892
00:52:23.50 --> 00:52:28.50
with other now, rather than grasslanding.

893
00:52:28.50 --> 00:52:32.50
So I did take it off, it was 60 knots

894
00:52:32.50 --> 00:52:35.50
and 560 knots, a little bit sideways.

895
00:52:35.50 --> 00:52:38.50
And it's like from the clouds,

896
00:52:38.50 --> 00:52:42.50
and I caught my...

897
00:52:42.50 --> 00:52:45.50
The arting me,

898
00:52:45.50 --> 00:52:47.50
who had landfills and big pay off

899
00:52:47.50 --> 00:52:51.50
or the extinct singles.

900
00:52:51.50 --> 00:52:55.50
Because I helped to make a grass,

901
00:52:55.50 --> 00:53:00.50
and I made a lot of big traffic

902
00:53:00.50 --> 00:53:03.50
and land, like a red and landing.

903
00:53:03.50 --> 00:53:06.50
And the tail wheel, that's down,

904
00:53:06.50 --> 00:53:07.50
I told my go-back,

905
00:53:07.50 --> 00:53:09.50
to the power.

906
00:53:09.50 --> 00:53:12.50
And he got off the power

907
00:53:12.50 --> 00:53:14.50
and he jumped the cell,

908
00:53:14.50 --> 00:53:16.50
slowly, slowly, he's head down,

909
00:53:16.50 --> 00:53:19.50
and he gets not running.

910
00:53:19.50 --> 00:53:21.50
He's a break,

911
00:53:21.50 --> 00:53:25.50
and he's back to to to to to to stop it,

912
00:53:25.50 --> 00:53:27.50
but it was not, but before,

913
00:53:27.50 --> 00:53:31.50
before I test that, I told my cruise ship,

914
00:53:31.50 --> 00:53:33.50
and I told him to tell the team,

915
00:53:33.50 --> 00:53:35.50
9 or 9 of them in the shop,

916
00:53:35.50 --> 00:53:36.50
and tell the team,

917
00:53:36.50 --> 00:53:38.50
when I slow down, he's shocked.

918
00:53:38.50 --> 00:53:40.50
And tell them to jump out.

919
00:53:40.50 --> 00:53:43.50
The 9 man team.

920
00:53:43.50 --> 00:53:44.50
Tell them to not do that,

921
00:53:44.50 --> 00:53:45.50
not to remain,

922
00:53:45.50 --> 00:53:48.50
because we can make a class.

923
00:53:48.50 --> 00:53:51.50
And try to need the,

924
00:53:51.50 --> 00:53:53.50
to jump,

925
00:53:53.50 --> 00:53:56.50
to the right and stop.

926
00:53:56.50 --> 00:53:57.50
But I looked down,

927
00:53:57.50 --> 00:53:59.50
like, no, no, damn jump out.

928
00:53:59.50 --> 00:54:02.50
Is he still, is he jumping?

929
00:54:02.50 --> 00:54:05.50
Man.

930
00:54:05.50 --> 00:54:08.50
And any of the 9 members of the team get wounded,

931
00:54:08.50 --> 00:54:10.50
one guy was wounded?

932
00:54:10.50 --> 00:54:12.50
No, nobody's wounded.

933
00:54:12.50 --> 00:54:14.50
But yet they shot the rotor,

934
00:54:14.50 --> 00:54:16.50
they, they, they cable to the rotor.

935
00:54:16.50 --> 00:54:17.50
Yeah, that's crazy.

936
00:54:17.50 --> 00:54:18.50
And did the aircraft,

937
00:54:18.50 --> 00:54:19.50
between the weight,

938
00:54:19.50 --> 00:54:20.50
and the weight,

939
00:54:20.50 --> 00:54:21.50
he, just a recycling stick.

940
00:54:21.50 --> 00:54:22.50
Yeah.

941
00:54:22.50 --> 00:54:24.50
He flew back sideways and decreased the speed.

942
00:54:24.50 --> 00:54:26.50
I, I never heard that story.

943
00:54:26.50 --> 00:54:28.50
This is another one of those,

944
00:54:28.50 --> 00:54:29.50
oh my God, stories.

945
00:54:29.50 --> 00:54:31.50
Just another day flying kingby.

946
00:54:31.50 --> 00:54:32.50
We,

947
00:54:32.50 --> 00:54:34.50
we kept them on.

948
00:54:34.50 --> 00:54:38.50
Now you know why we say never one pilot.

949
00:54:38.50 --> 00:54:40.50
Man.

950
00:54:40.50 --> 00:54:43.50
I tell you one thing.

951
00:54:43.50 --> 00:54:45.50
Even at that time,

952
00:54:45.50 --> 00:54:46.50
we have the, uh,

953
00:54:46.50 --> 00:54:47.50
good chip.

954
00:54:47.50 --> 00:54:48.50
Yes.

955
00:54:48.50 --> 00:54:49.50
But to go for the house out,

956
00:54:49.50 --> 00:54:51.50
then we can make a lot of things.

957
00:54:51.50 --> 00:54:52.50
Is that right?

958
00:54:52.50 --> 00:54:53.50
Yeah.

959
00:54:53.50 --> 00:54:54.50
Because we,

960
00:54:54.50 --> 00:54:55.50
you know,

961
00:54:55.50 --> 00:54:56.50
you know,

962
00:54:56.50 --> 00:54:58.50
when you go out to this operation,

963
00:54:58.50 --> 00:55:04.50
the fueling and the thinking of the enemy,

964
00:55:04.50 --> 00:55:07.50
what they are not thinking.

965
00:55:07.50 --> 00:55:09.50
We can guess,

966
00:55:09.50 --> 00:55:10.50
but you know,

967
00:55:10.50 --> 00:55:12.50
you could guess what they are doing.

968
00:55:12.50 --> 00:55:15.50
What they are going to do.

969
00:55:15.50 --> 00:55:17.50
So you're saying that the American,

970
00:55:17.50 --> 00:55:18.50
the Americans,

971
00:55:18.50 --> 00:55:20.50
we would do random things.

972
00:55:20.50 --> 00:55:21.50
But the enemy,

973
00:55:21.50 --> 00:55:23.50
you kind of knew what they were going to do.

974
00:55:23.50 --> 00:55:24.50
They fall in patterns.

975
00:55:24.50 --> 00:55:26.50
We can guess most of them.

976
00:55:26.50 --> 00:55:27.50
Wow.

977
00:55:27.50 --> 00:55:33.50
The Americans just go out and receive a little ground fire somewhere.

978
00:55:33.50 --> 00:55:35.50
And they put the surprise it,

979
00:55:35.50 --> 00:55:36.50
try to surprise it.

980
00:55:36.50 --> 00:55:37.50
But for us,

981
00:55:37.50 --> 00:55:41.50
we can guess where they are going to put again.

982
00:55:41.50 --> 00:55:42.50
Or,

983
00:55:42.50 --> 00:55:47.50
or what they are going to plan.

984
00:55:47.50 --> 00:55:49.50
Because sometimes when,

985
00:55:49.50 --> 00:55:52.50
one time I was shot,

986
00:55:52.50 --> 00:55:55.50
I was taking up the Aussie and,

987
00:55:55.50 --> 00:56:05.50
I heard heavy, heavy ground fire from the high side.

988
00:56:05.50 --> 00:56:07.50
And I looked back and I saw the,

989
00:56:07.50 --> 00:56:08.50
and we,

990
00:56:08.50 --> 00:56:11.50
she did behind the 50-carbo.

991
00:56:11.50 --> 00:56:13.50
I sure they didn't make.

992
00:56:13.50 --> 00:56:15.50
Less than 100-year.

993
00:56:15.50 --> 00:56:18.50
And so I,

994
00:56:18.50 --> 00:56:21.50
I died out of the bamboo top.

995
00:56:21.50 --> 00:56:23.50
And back to the exact price.

996
00:56:23.50 --> 00:56:25.50
But the,

997
00:56:25.50 --> 00:56:26.50
I escaped,

998
00:56:26.50 --> 00:56:29.50
but the second king became mean and,

999
00:56:29.50 --> 00:56:31.50
they made it.

1000
00:56:31.50 --> 00:56:33.50
Second,

1001
00:56:33.50 --> 00:56:35.50
give me a shot down,

1002
00:56:35.50 --> 00:56:36.50
shot down,

1003
00:56:36.50 --> 00:56:37.50
cut fire.

1004
00:56:37.50 --> 00:56:38.50
Wow.

1005
00:56:38.50 --> 00:56:40.50
It's too close.

1006
00:56:40.50 --> 00:56:42.50
Less than 100-year.

1007
00:56:42.50 --> 00:56:43.50
I'm,

1008
00:56:43.50 --> 00:56:48.50
another one,

1009
00:56:48.50 --> 00:56:51.50
until it was telling me about,

1010
00:56:51.50 --> 00:56:52.50
was,

1011
00:56:52.50 --> 00:56:53.50
you,

1012
00:56:53.50 --> 00:56:54.50
you got something hit.

1013
00:56:54.50 --> 00:56:55.50
And you got hit by something.

1014
00:56:55.50 --> 00:56:57.50
And it almost knocked you out of your seat.

1015
00:56:57.50 --> 00:56:58.50
Yes.

1016
00:56:58.50 --> 00:56:59.50
And there was a,

1017
00:56:59.50 --> 00:57:01.50
like a two-inch hole in the back of the king.

1018
00:57:01.50 --> 00:57:02.50
What was that?

1019
00:57:02.50 --> 00:57:04.50
We couldn't find the foul.

1020
00:57:04.50 --> 00:57:06.50
We couldn't find the idea around.

1021
00:57:06.50 --> 00:57:07.50
And I don't,

1022
00:57:07.50 --> 00:57:09.50
what kind of,

1023
00:57:09.50 --> 00:57:10.50
what kind of,

1024
00:57:10.50 --> 00:57:11.50
what kind of,

1025
00:57:11.50 --> 00:57:11.50
what kind of,

1026
00:57:11.50 --> 00:57:12.50
what kind of,

1027
00:57:12.50 --> 00:57:14.50
what kind of,

1028
00:57:14.50 --> 00:57:15.50
what kind of,

1029
00:57:15.50 --> 00:57:16.50
what kind of,

1030
00:57:16.50 --> 00:57:17.50
what kind of,

1031
00:57:17.50 --> 00:57:18.50
what kind of,

1032
00:57:18.50 --> 00:57:18.50
what kind of,

1033
00:57:19.50 --> 00:57:20.50
what kind of,

1034
00:57:20.50 --> 00:57:21.50
what kind of,

1035
00:57:21.50 --> 00:57:23.50
maybe is just one or nothing but family know me for...

1036
00:57:23.50 --> 00:57:25.50
that Day lights,

1037
00:57:25.50 --> 00:57:26.50
and it's certainly,

1038
00:57:26.50 --> 00:57:27.50
this direction.

1039
00:57:27.50 --> 00:57:29.50
That somebody hit me with a hammer in the vacuum.

1040
00:57:29.50 --> 00:57:29.50
That.

1041
00:57:29.50 --> 00:57:29.50
like.

1042
00:57:29.50 --> 00:57:31.50
just hit me for a,

1043
00:57:31.50 --> 00:57:31.50
the get,

1044
00:57:31.50 --> 00:57:32.50
He was like,

1045
00:57:32.50 --> 00:57:32.50
it used,

1046
00:57:32.50 --> 00:57:34.50
can't,

1047
00:57:34.50 --> 00:57:35.50
can't let I go like,

1048
00:57:35.50 --> 00:57:36.50
he simply?

1049
00:57:36.50 --> 00:57:36.50
I thought,

1050
00:57:36.50 --> 00:57:38.50
he did a.

1051
00:57:38.50 --> 00:57:39.50
He did a,

1052
00:57:39.50 --> 00:57:40.50
And he did it and will not,

1053
00:57:40.50 --> 00:57:40.50
He did it.

1054
00:57:40.50 --> 00:57:41.50
Alright,

1055
00:57:41.50 --> 00:57:42.50
I used,

1056
00:57:42.50 --> 00:57:43.50
and then I clean

1057
00:57:43.50 --> 00:57:42.50
I

1058
00:57:42.50 --> 00:57:44.50
team,

1059
00:57:44.50 --> 00:57:46.50
He's glad I.

1060
00:57:46.50 --> 00:57:46.50
I used,

1061
00:57:46.50 --> 00:57:56.50
And when they got home, I checked the law and I saw the bike seat, the bike of my seat.

1062
00:57:56.50 --> 00:58:00.50
The whole bit of this one.

1063
00:58:00.50 --> 00:58:02.50
Yeah.

1064
00:58:02.50 --> 00:58:04.50
And we're finally the one.

1065
00:58:04.50 --> 00:58:07.50
Did you guys, was there any armored all on the Kingby?

1066
00:58:07.50 --> 00:58:08.50
No.

1067
00:58:08.50 --> 00:58:10.50
No armor, just aluminum.

1068
00:58:10.50 --> 00:58:11.50
I don't mean them.

1069
00:58:11.50 --> 00:58:13.50
Can't stop anything.

1070
00:58:13.50 --> 00:58:16.50
I said, oh, yeah, one dead as a one.

1071
00:58:16.50 --> 00:58:17.50
I'm afraid.

1072
00:58:17.50 --> 00:58:19.50
You need to answer the answer.

1073
00:58:19.50 --> 00:58:20.50
Under the answer.

1074
00:58:20.50 --> 00:58:21.50
Yeah, an armor plate.

1075
00:58:21.50 --> 00:58:22.50
Oh, to be honest.

1076
00:58:22.50 --> 00:58:24.50
Maybe 18 inches wide.

1077
00:58:24.50 --> 00:58:28.50
We wrap up on the sides under the easy engine.

1078
00:58:28.50 --> 00:58:30.50
Best about the only armor I'm aware of.

1079
00:58:30.50 --> 00:58:31.50
Yeah.

1080
00:58:31.50 --> 00:58:32.50
Yeah.

1081
00:58:32.50 --> 00:58:33.50
Would you wear?

1082
00:58:33.50 --> 00:58:35.50
Did you wear a flack vest or anything?

1083
00:58:35.50 --> 00:58:36.50
No.

1084
00:58:36.50 --> 00:58:37.50
No point.

1085
00:58:37.50 --> 00:58:38.50
No.

1086
00:58:38.50 --> 00:58:42.50
They're able to cool Kingby flight.

1087
00:58:42.50 --> 00:58:43.50
Just a flight suit.

1088
00:58:43.50 --> 00:58:44.50
Overalls.

1089
00:58:44.50 --> 00:58:52.50
Have their Kingby Siggins on them and they have their holster on their hip like a cowboy.

1090
00:58:52.50 --> 00:58:56.50
They're really good looking uniforms.

1091
00:58:56.50 --> 00:58:59.50
I like the black was best.

1092
00:58:59.50 --> 00:59:03.50
How many operations do you think you flew?

1093
00:59:03.50 --> 00:59:05.50
This guy could eat.

1094
00:59:05.50 --> 00:59:08.50
I got four thousand hours.

1095
00:59:08.50 --> 00:59:14.50
And minus one thousand hours for Ryzen or in the other.

1096
00:59:14.50 --> 00:59:16.50
Other thing.

1097
00:59:16.50 --> 00:59:18.50
So three thousand.

1098
00:59:18.50 --> 00:59:19.50
Two thousand.

1099
00:59:19.50 --> 00:59:20.50
Two thousand.

1100
00:59:20.50 --> 00:59:22.50
Two thousand.

1101
00:59:22.50 --> 00:59:24.50
For each mission.

1102
00:59:24.50 --> 00:59:26.50
So 1500 or so missions.

1103
00:59:26.50 --> 00:59:27.50
Yeah, keep it.

1104
00:59:27.50 --> 00:59:28.50
Keep it.

1105
00:59:28.50 --> 00:59:29.50
Keep it.

1106
00:59:29.50 --> 00:59:32.50
These are all song missions.

1107
00:59:32.50 --> 00:59:33.50
Yeah.

1108
00:59:33.50 --> 00:59:38.48
How often, how often would you have any contact on the ground when you were

1109
00:59:38.48 --> 00:59:39.48
in?

1110
00:59:39.48 --> 00:59:46.48
Usually they.

1111
00:59:46.48 --> 00:59:57.48
When I came in to introduce the team and I saw something.

1112
00:59:57.48 --> 00:59:58.48
One decision.

1113
00:59:58.48 --> 01:00:03.48
Like one time when I went to the airs.

1114
01:00:03.48 --> 01:00:07.48
And I saw the telephone line on the airs.

1115
01:00:07.48 --> 01:00:10.48
And the team was getting off.

1116
01:00:10.48 --> 01:00:13.48
I came back to back.

1117
01:00:13.48 --> 01:00:17.48
And they came back to the one time that I saw it.

1118
01:00:17.48 --> 01:00:20.48
And I bought the bike right away.

1119
01:00:20.48 --> 01:00:26.48
But most of the time when we got shot when we take off from the airs.

1120
01:00:26.48 --> 01:00:29.48
When the team would say it's for the extraction.

1121
01:00:29.48 --> 01:00:30.48
Yeah, for the extraction.

1122
01:00:30.48 --> 01:00:31.48
Yeah.

1123
01:00:31.48 --> 01:00:33.48
So most of the time you could get in.

1124
01:00:33.48 --> 01:00:36.48
Well, you were just pulled the team out almost immediately.

1125
01:00:36.48 --> 01:00:37.48
If you guys took a good time.

1126
01:00:37.48 --> 01:00:40.48
Yeah, if we were compromised and we just try to get it back.

1127
01:00:40.48 --> 01:00:41.48
Go out.

1128
01:00:41.48 --> 01:00:42.48
If we could.

1129
01:00:42.48 --> 01:00:43.48
We're percentage.

1130
01:00:43.48 --> 01:00:45.48
You think you guys were compromised on the insert.

1131
01:00:45.48 --> 01:00:47.48
Probably a lot more than we realized.

1132
01:00:47.48 --> 01:00:48.48
Mm-hmm.

1133
01:00:48.48 --> 01:00:50.48
Could they have had the LC watchers.

1134
01:00:50.48 --> 01:00:53.48
And they would like to get us on the ground first.

1135
01:00:53.48 --> 01:00:55.48
Particularly by the end of 68.

1136
01:00:55.48 --> 01:00:59.48
Could they had the, uh, saw 100 killer teams that were out there.

1137
01:00:59.48 --> 01:01:01.48
They're main mission was to find us.

1138
01:01:01.48 --> 01:01:02.48
Yeah.

1139
01:01:02.48 --> 01:01:04.48
I would think they would want to wait to you inserted.

1140
01:01:04.48 --> 01:01:05.48
Right.

1141
01:01:05.48 --> 01:01:06.48
Let's see you insert.

1142
01:01:06.48 --> 01:01:09.48
Let the helicopter leave and then roll you up.

1143
01:01:09.48 --> 01:01:10.48
There we go.

1144
01:01:10.48 --> 01:01:15.48
So the insert usually would go well on less there days.

1145
01:01:15.48 --> 01:01:20.48
Like we had that time in November where we could get shot out the primary secondary and the

1146
01:01:20.48 --> 01:01:21.48
alternate.

1147
01:01:21.48 --> 01:01:22.48
And the kingbies would go in.

1148
01:01:22.48 --> 01:01:23.48
Bing, Bing, Bing.

1149
01:01:23.48 --> 01:01:24.48
Go have lunch.

1150
01:01:24.48 --> 01:01:26.48
They would refuel have a little lunch.

1151
01:01:26.48 --> 01:01:27.48
There's another target.

1152
01:01:27.48 --> 01:01:29.48
Go back and do it again.

1153
01:01:29.48 --> 01:01:31.48
And often they would come back with bullholes.

1154
01:01:31.48 --> 01:01:34.48
Could we, uh, Lily got shot out there.

1155
01:01:34.48 --> 01:01:35.48
Does any of me activity here?

1156
01:01:35.48 --> 01:01:36.48
We wouldn't go.

1157
01:01:36.48 --> 01:01:37.48
You know, you're compromised.

1158
01:01:37.48 --> 01:01:41.48
You want to try to get them to ground and get going with the mission.

1159
01:01:41.48 --> 01:01:44.48
And we had several days like that back to back to back in the king.

1160
01:01:44.48 --> 01:01:46.48
He's got beat up.

1161
01:01:46.48 --> 01:01:50.48
But fortunately, nothing was got shot down.

1162
01:01:50.48 --> 01:01:52.48
And the Sikorsky's just a beat.

1163
01:01:52.48 --> 01:01:55.48
That's just a, that's just a horse of a aircraft.

1164
01:01:55.48 --> 01:01:56.48
Yeah.

1165
01:01:56.48 --> 01:01:58.48
Only had one door, but it had the windows.

1166
01:01:58.48 --> 01:02:00.48
So whenever we're distracted, our,

1167
01:02:00.48 --> 01:02:04.48
the first man in the chop would go to the, to the, uh, left window.

1168
01:02:04.48 --> 01:02:05.48
You mean the port side?

1169
01:02:05.48 --> 01:02:06.48
Port.

1170
01:02:06.48 --> 01:02:07.48
That's why man.

1171
01:02:07.48 --> 01:02:10.48
How we get the port confusing start.

1172
01:02:10.48 --> 01:02:11.48
Unless I'm drinking port.

1173
01:02:11.48 --> 01:02:14.48
And that's not me man, right there.

1174
01:02:14.48 --> 01:02:15.48
And the left side.

1175
01:02:15.48 --> 01:02:16.48
Yes.

1176
01:02:16.48 --> 01:02:18.48
Is the bull kid secure?

1177
01:02:18.48 --> 01:02:19.48
The bull kid is secure.

1178
01:02:19.48 --> 01:02:20.48
There you go.

1179
01:02:20.48 --> 01:02:21.48
You're all, baby.

1180
01:02:21.48 --> 01:02:25.48
And then right here, we can interject.

1181
01:02:25.48 --> 01:02:29.48
Um,

1182
01:02:29.48 --> 01:02:32.48
sometimes they would be in the air.

1183
01:02:32.48 --> 01:02:36.48
And there would be an emergency call for any helicopter,

1184
01:02:36.48 --> 01:02:39.48
which he did in August of 1969.

1185
01:02:39.48 --> 01:02:44.48
I forget what you were on, but this is that mission with Scarface.

1186
01:02:44.48 --> 01:02:45.48
Mm-hmm.

1187
01:02:45.48 --> 01:02:48.48
And Scarface was making a gun run.

1188
01:02:48.48 --> 01:02:51.48
And they were working conjunction with the, uh,

1189
01:02:51.48 --> 01:02:55.48
the hunter first airborne on their air mobile units.

1190
01:02:55.48 --> 01:02:56.48
Mm-hmm.

1191
01:02:56.48 --> 01:03:01.48
And there was, uh, like a river stream, and they were making a gun run.

1192
01:03:01.48 --> 01:03:03.48
So the hunter first had gone down with the coba.

1193
01:03:03.48 --> 01:03:05.48
They had coba then.

1194
01:03:05.48 --> 01:03:07.48
Scarface came in with a regular gun ship.

1195
01:03:07.48 --> 01:03:08.48
Got hit.

1196
01:03:08.48 --> 01:03:13.48
As it went down, it flipped over to the door to crew members came out.

1197
01:03:13.48 --> 01:03:15.48
It crashed upside down.

1198
01:03:15.48 --> 01:03:19.48
They put out an emergency call on was there.

1199
01:03:19.48 --> 01:03:21.48
He response to the call.

1200
01:03:21.48 --> 01:03:23.48
The gunships went down.

1201
01:03:23.48 --> 01:03:29.48
And they made a gun run on each side of the down upside down Scarface.

1202
01:03:29.48 --> 01:03:31.48
He followed right in.

1203
01:03:31.48 --> 01:03:36.48
And he picked up the two two crew members.

1204
01:03:36.48 --> 01:03:38.48
He picked up with either the,

1205
01:03:38.48 --> 01:03:39.48
No, I didn't pick up the air.

1206
01:03:39.48 --> 01:03:40.48
Just spot them.

1207
01:03:40.48 --> 01:03:41.48
You spot them first?

1208
01:03:41.48 --> 01:03:46.48
Because I, uh, I, I flew along the stream to see what the, uh,

1209
01:03:46.48 --> 01:03:50.48
I, I, I, I identified the people.

1210
01:03:50.48 --> 01:03:55.48
And I spot two of them standing on the big ground about this, this table.

1211
01:03:55.48 --> 01:03:58.48
And I called them like I'm now.

1212
01:03:58.48 --> 01:04:02.48
And they, I keep, so they, they came down to pick them up.

1213
01:04:02.48 --> 01:04:07.48
And I keep, I'd down the, uh, stream to look for other people.

1214
01:04:07.48 --> 01:04:09.48
And I couldn't find any more.

1215
01:04:09.48 --> 01:04:10.48
I come back.

1216
01:04:10.48 --> 01:04:16.48
I came back to the, uh, to the down here with the subside down.

1217
01:04:16.48 --> 01:04:21.48
And I couldn't see anyone, I couldn't see inside the cabin or our cockpit.

1218
01:04:21.48 --> 01:04:26.48
So I used my ride wheel to turn it back.

1219
01:04:26.48 --> 01:04:27.48
Hmm.

1220
01:04:27.48 --> 01:04:28.48
You flipped over the he way.

1221
01:04:28.48 --> 01:04:30.48
Well, under enemy fire.

1222
01:04:30.48 --> 01:04:34.48
And I checked the entire, I just don't know what he's in there.

1223
01:04:34.48 --> 01:04:37.48
So I thought I, I couldn't find any more.

1224
01:04:37.48 --> 01:04:39.48
Then you have your crew chief hang out the door.

1225
01:04:39.48 --> 01:04:40.48
Yeah.

1226
01:04:40.48 --> 01:04:43.48
And then he was able to say that he saw people in the pile of the copouts.

1227
01:04:43.48 --> 01:04:50.48
Uh, because this day, there's two, those are the two, uh, only two scar face marines,

1228
01:04:50.48 --> 01:04:53.48
aviators that are still listed as MIA.

1229
01:04:53.48 --> 01:04:54.48
Oh, that's true.

1230
01:04:54.48 --> 01:04:58.48
I think it was the pilot and, and the crew chief, because the copilot got out.

1231
01:04:58.48 --> 01:05:01.48
And they were able to rescue those two.

1232
01:05:01.48 --> 01:05:05.48
And, uh, and the bubble of the front of the U.E.

1233
01:05:05.48 --> 01:05:07.48
Where he put his, you know, the strut,

1234
01:05:07.48 --> 01:05:10.48
and put the wheel in and lifted up the helicopter.

1235
01:05:10.48 --> 01:05:14.48
And the crew chief goes and hangs out all while under enemy fire.

1236
01:05:14.48 --> 01:05:22.48
So in August 2000, scar face honored on at a banquet in San Diego,

1237
01:05:22.48 --> 01:05:24.48
to thank him for the heroic mission.

1238
01:05:24.48 --> 01:05:28.48
And they helped get your award for the mission to correct.

1239
01:05:28.48 --> 01:05:29.48
Was that part of that?

1240
01:05:29.48 --> 01:05:30.48
Hmm, no yet.

1241
01:05:30.48 --> 01:05:31.48
Not yet.

1242
01:05:31.48 --> 01:05:34.48
But that was one mission where he was just flying.

1243
01:05:34.48 --> 01:05:36.48
And they had to call for help.

1244
01:05:36.48 --> 01:05:38.48
He responded to help scar face.

1245
01:05:38.48 --> 01:05:42.48
Because scar face and the hundred first that protected Kingby's all the time.

1246
01:05:42.48 --> 01:05:44.48
And you got shot up on that one, too.

1247
01:05:44.48 --> 01:05:47.48
It wasn't like we're just another day in the park.

1248
01:05:47.48 --> 01:05:50.48
He's helping the marines try to find those aviators.

1249
01:05:50.48 --> 01:05:52.48
And I'm not sure how many hits he got.

1250
01:05:52.48 --> 01:05:55.48
But just the fact that go down the stream,

1251
01:05:55.48 --> 01:05:59.48
put the strut underneath the front nose had been knocked out and lifted up

1252
01:05:59.48 --> 01:06:02.48
to give them a status report.

1253
01:06:02.48 --> 01:06:03.48
Hmm.

1254
01:06:03.48 --> 01:06:05.48
Just another day with the Kingby's.

1255
01:06:05.48 --> 01:06:06.48
Hmm.

1256
01:06:06.48 --> 01:06:07.48
Amazing.

1257
01:06:07.48 --> 01:06:13.48
Yeah, that, you know, the reputation you guys had must have been just.

1258
01:06:13.48 --> 01:06:16.48
I mean, that opening that I read from this,

1259
01:06:16.48 --> 01:06:18.48
like it's just epic, you know,

1260
01:06:18.48 --> 01:06:22.48
to hear the relief from Watkins,

1261
01:06:22.48 --> 01:06:25.48
who hears who it is, like, okay, now we got a chance.

1262
01:06:25.48 --> 01:06:26.48
Yeah.

1263
01:06:26.48 --> 01:06:30.48
And that was always our golden moment.

1264
01:06:30.48 --> 01:06:32.48
We were on a ground, you're in a firefight,

1265
01:06:32.48 --> 01:06:34.48
and they say the Kingby's are coming.

1266
01:06:34.48 --> 01:06:37.48
It's like, thank God for the Kingby's.

1267
01:06:37.48 --> 01:06:41.48
On that mission, when you decide, hey, you know what?

1268
01:06:41.48 --> 01:06:43.48
I'm not going to bring a co-pilot.

1269
01:06:43.48 --> 01:06:44.48
I'm not going to bring a coup-cheaf.

1270
01:06:44.48 --> 01:06:47.48
I'm just going to bring me and the gunner.

1271
01:06:47.48 --> 01:06:48.48
That's it.

1272
01:06:48.48 --> 01:06:53.48
That seems like that seems like a kind of crazy decision to make.

1273
01:06:53.48 --> 01:06:58.48
Because we, with my wife, I know that the situation was too bad.

1274
01:06:58.48 --> 01:07:02.48
And we have to go out to as fast as we can.

1275
01:07:02.48 --> 01:07:05.48
So we can't bring them home.

1276
01:07:05.48 --> 01:07:08.48
As fast as you can, meaning it would have taken time

1277
01:07:08.48 --> 01:07:10.48
to round up the copilot?

1278
01:07:10.48 --> 01:07:11.48
No.

1279
01:07:11.48 --> 01:07:20.48
If one time when we was, they were put in a motor in a nettle.

1280
01:07:20.48 --> 01:07:26.48
And I saw the, the, the, the, the, the, the,

1281
01:07:26.48 --> 01:07:30.48
it's moke came out from the gun on the other side of the hill.

1282
01:07:30.48 --> 01:07:37.48
And I saw, I, I ran to the my job and the climb up and couldn't get up.

1283
01:07:37.48 --> 01:07:41.48
And when I was taking off, the group of copilot was late.

1284
01:07:41.48 --> 01:07:43.48
And he just cried.

1285
01:07:43.48 --> 01:07:46.48
So you didn't care if you had a copilot or not?

1286
01:07:46.48 --> 01:07:47.48
No, I didn't.

1287
01:07:47.48 --> 01:07:56.48
What was just like that mission later in the book with a chapter 20 when they had the night bright light.

1288
01:07:56.48 --> 01:07:57.48
Yeah.

1289
01:07:57.48 --> 01:07:59.48
Where the hatchet force had been in.

1290
01:07:59.48 --> 01:08:01.48
They had severe casualties.

1291
01:08:01.48 --> 01:08:04.48
They had all been expiltrated out.

1292
01:08:04.48 --> 01:08:11.48
The last helicopter went in was again, you went in on strings to pick up the team leader from the hatchet force.

1293
01:08:11.48 --> 01:08:14.48
They had a sergeant estate back in the couple indigenous troops.

1294
01:08:14.48 --> 01:08:18.48
And the chopper got shot down the crest.

1295
01:08:18.48 --> 01:08:23.48
And then that night they asked to go in and this is October 69.

1296
01:08:23.48 --> 01:08:28.48
And limb black went in and on took them out.

1297
01:08:28.48 --> 01:08:30.48
Again, with no crew.

1298
01:08:30.48 --> 01:08:32.48
They took them out at night.

1299
01:08:32.48 --> 01:08:33.48
Found the LZ.

1300
01:08:33.48 --> 01:08:35.48
They thought they thought they were going to have to repell in.

1301
01:08:35.48 --> 01:08:40.48
But somehow he's able to find an area big enough to get the king be in and went down.

1302
01:08:40.48 --> 01:08:41.48
Lim black got in.

1303
01:08:41.48 --> 01:08:45.48
Picked up the picked up the team member had a broken back.

1304
01:08:45.48 --> 01:08:47.48
And the other survivors.

1305
01:08:47.48 --> 01:08:50.48
And then he came back again at night.

1306
01:08:50.48 --> 01:08:51.48
Picked up the team.

1307
01:08:51.48 --> 01:08:54.48
I think this time they had the pull him out and strings.

1308
01:08:54.48 --> 01:08:56.48
And then they pulled them out.

1309
01:08:56.48 --> 01:09:00.48
Was there anyone else that could fly at night like you could?

1310
01:09:00.48 --> 01:09:02.48
Yes, I'm moving.

1311
01:09:02.48 --> 01:09:04.48
Was it your eyesight?

1312
01:09:04.48 --> 01:09:07.48
Was it just the amount of hours that you had in the helicopter?

1313
01:09:07.48 --> 01:09:10.48
Oh, you know, I can see.

1314
01:09:10.48 --> 01:09:21.48
You know at that time they think they really have the sea model.

1315
01:09:21.48 --> 01:09:26.48
We got from the army.

1316
01:09:26.48 --> 01:09:28.48
We have the ADF, VHS and FM.

1317
01:09:28.48 --> 01:09:30.48
But the D-Morrow.

1318
01:09:30.48 --> 01:09:33.48
We got from the Marine.

1319
01:09:33.48 --> 01:09:40.48
We have detected VHS, VHS, FM.

1320
01:09:40.48 --> 01:09:48.48
But since the Titan and the VHS, we don't use the alphabet.

1321
01:09:48.48 --> 01:09:51.48
We almost never use it. And it's too heavy.

1322
01:09:51.48 --> 01:09:54.48
And it started in the tail boom.

1323
01:09:54.48 --> 01:09:56.48
And it might cause each other heavy.

1324
01:09:56.48 --> 01:09:58.48
Tell you what heavy.

1325
01:09:58.48 --> 01:10:00.48
So I removed all of them.

1326
01:10:00.48 --> 01:10:02.48
You said it was extra radios out.

1327
01:10:02.48 --> 01:10:03.48
Yeah.

1328
01:10:03.48 --> 01:10:09.48
We only needed the EWSF and the FM.

1329
01:10:09.48 --> 01:10:10.48
That's all.

1330
01:10:10.48 --> 01:10:13.48
And this leads me to a quick side bar.

1331
01:10:13.48 --> 01:10:18.48
I don't know if this is you or not, but we had 68.

1332
01:10:18.48 --> 01:10:20.48
The Kingbees had the Marines.

1333
01:10:20.48 --> 01:10:23.48
One of them thraced the Kingbees to Fubai.

1334
01:10:23.48 --> 01:10:25.48
So they had, I mean, just the race.

1335
01:10:25.48 --> 01:10:26.48
A race, race.

1336
01:10:26.48 --> 01:10:27.48
They had their own feet.

1337
01:10:27.48 --> 01:10:30.48
This is just going from Denang, from the Air Base.

1338
01:10:30.48 --> 01:10:32.48
And the Kingbees go, we'll race you to Fubai.

1339
01:10:32.48 --> 01:10:34.48
So Kingbees versus what?

1340
01:10:34.48 --> 01:10:36.48
The first is the Marine Corps, H34s.

1341
01:10:36.48 --> 01:10:38.48
They still have some H34s.

1342
01:10:38.48 --> 01:10:40.48
Oh, so it's just Kingbee versus Kingbee.

1343
01:10:40.48 --> 01:10:41.48
Yeah.

1344
01:10:41.48 --> 01:10:42.48
But Kingbee versus Marine Corps.

1345
01:10:42.48 --> 01:10:44.48
They've got it with all the radios.

1346
01:10:44.48 --> 01:10:49.48
So the Marines had to go around high-van pass and go over to South China Sea.

1347
01:10:49.48 --> 01:10:51.48
Kingbees fly up and over.

1348
01:10:51.48 --> 01:10:52.48
Kingbees.

1349
01:10:52.48 --> 01:10:54.48
They get the Fubai win $100.

1350
01:10:54.48 --> 01:10:57.48
I hope that was your job.

1351
01:10:57.48 --> 01:10:59.48
That was one of our favorite Kingbees stories.

1352
01:10:59.48 --> 01:11:02.48
The freshman always told that one.

1353
01:11:02.48 --> 01:11:04.48
Man.

1354
01:11:04.48 --> 01:11:07.48
And then who's your maintenance crews?

1355
01:11:07.48 --> 01:11:08.48
Oh, yeah.

1356
01:11:08.48 --> 01:11:09.48
Was it Vietnamese?

1357
01:11:09.48 --> 01:11:10.48
Yes.

1358
01:11:10.48 --> 01:11:11.48
Air Force.

1359
01:11:11.48 --> 01:11:13.48
They were in the Air Base.

1360
01:11:13.48 --> 01:11:15.48
They were in the military circles.

1361
01:11:15.48 --> 01:11:19.48
And later on, we got the...

1362
01:11:21.48 --> 01:11:22.48
Let's see.

1363
01:11:22.48 --> 01:11:23.48
What was that?

1364
01:11:23.48 --> 01:11:24.48
I said the Air Force.

1365
01:11:24.48 --> 01:11:27.48
Again, L-O-O-O-D.

1366
01:11:27.48 --> 01:11:31.48
This is American company.

1367
01:11:31.48 --> 01:11:33.48
American company.

1368
01:11:33.48 --> 01:11:34.48
Yeah.

1369
01:11:34.48 --> 01:11:40.48
The main job is to refresh the park.

1370
01:11:40.48 --> 01:11:45.48
I suppose to change the tail rotor.

1371
01:11:45.48 --> 01:11:49.48
They make the whole set and put it up.

1372
01:11:49.48 --> 01:11:52.48
This is a change in the whole set.

1373
01:11:52.48 --> 01:11:55.48
But I don't trust them.

1374
01:11:55.48 --> 01:11:57.48
You know why?

1375
01:11:57.48 --> 01:12:05.48
Because one time after the change the tail rotor.

1376
01:12:05.48 --> 01:12:10.48
And after I checked everything,

1377
01:12:10.48 --> 01:12:14.48
I served to Kaya for the shopping kind of the engine.

1378
01:12:14.48 --> 01:12:18.48
And the shopping kind of happened now.

1379
01:12:18.48 --> 01:12:19.48
Up and down.

1380
01:12:19.48 --> 01:12:24.48
And I just picked up the needle and cut off the engine.

1381
01:12:24.48 --> 01:12:26.48
And the shopping was the craziest.

1382
01:12:26.48 --> 01:12:27.48
I made it.

1383
01:12:27.48 --> 01:12:29.48
It's stuck in the nose come up.

1384
01:12:29.48 --> 01:12:32.48
And I go down and check.

1385
01:12:32.48 --> 01:12:35.48
I checked and checked the tail.

1386
01:12:35.48 --> 01:12:36.48
Oh my god.

1387
01:12:36.48 --> 01:12:38.48
Why is it only one more other three breaks?

1388
01:12:38.48 --> 01:12:40.48
And I remained.

1389
01:12:40.48 --> 01:12:43.48
He's supposed to have a fault break.

1390
01:12:43.48 --> 01:12:44.48
Oh, I don't have a break.

1391
01:12:44.48 --> 01:12:46.48
One was not there.

1392
01:12:46.48 --> 01:12:49.48
Until Roo was MIA.

1393
01:12:49.48 --> 01:12:51.48
I got a wrong one.

1394
01:12:51.48 --> 01:12:52.48
I got a wrong one.

1395
01:12:52.48 --> 01:12:53.48
I got a wrong one.

1396
01:12:53.48 --> 01:12:58.48
Yeah, we had an in Vietnam for the seals in Vietnam.

1397
01:12:58.48 --> 01:13:00.48
They had a similar relationship

1398
01:13:00.48 --> 01:13:05.48
that the saw guys had with the Kimbees with the sea wolves.

1399
01:13:05.48 --> 01:13:09.48
And they had to kind of improvise.

1400
01:13:09.48 --> 01:13:10.48
Improvise.

1401
01:13:10.48 --> 01:13:14.48
And their maintenance, they were very proud of their maintenance crews.

1402
01:13:14.48 --> 01:13:17.48
Because their maintenance crews would keep those aircraft running.

1403
01:13:17.48 --> 01:13:19.48
And they would do whatever they had to do.

1404
01:13:19.48 --> 01:13:22.48
And Rob cheating steel to keep the aircraft running.

1405
01:13:22.48 --> 01:13:25.48
They were all ready.

1406
01:13:25.48 --> 01:13:27.48
You know, use birds that had,

1407
01:13:27.48 --> 01:13:30.48
forget they scrimmed up the aircraft themselves from somewhere.

1408
01:13:30.48 --> 01:13:32.48
They're kind of left over aircraft.

1409
01:13:32.48 --> 01:13:36.48
And so that it wasn't just the pilots and the gunners.

1410
01:13:36.48 --> 01:13:43.48
And then on top of that, these incredibly hard work and sailors in the Navy that were making those birds able to fly on a moment's notice.

1411
01:13:43.48 --> 01:13:44.48
Absolutely.

1412
01:13:44.48 --> 01:13:53.48
But it's a very similar relationship for the saw guys and the Kingbee pilots as it is for the seals and the sea wolf guys.

1413
01:13:53.48 --> 01:13:54.48
Oh, they're of legend.

1414
01:13:54.48 --> 01:13:55.48
Absolutely.

1415
01:13:55.48 --> 01:13:56.48
Yeah.

1416
01:13:56.48 --> 01:13:59.48
And just the similar, you know, the attitude, you know what you said,

1417
01:13:59.48 --> 01:14:13.48
Con, or on earlier when I asked you, you know, what, what do you think about when you need to go back into a spot where two Kingbees have already shot down.

1418
01:14:13.48 --> 01:14:14.48
It then shot down.

1419
01:14:14.48 --> 01:14:17.48
And your response was I want to get my friends out.

1420
01:14:17.48 --> 01:14:18.48
That's it.

1421
01:14:18.48 --> 01:14:24.48
That's, that's the a spree to core that is just unmatched, you know, and having that relationship with.

1422
01:14:24.48 --> 01:14:30.48
And just that that warrior brotherhood is.

1423
01:14:30.48 --> 01:14:36.48
So there's a very human side like there's a few times that we could pull that right at last light.

1424
01:14:36.48 --> 01:14:44.48
We go to the Kingbee pilots say, hey, come on, I'll buy you a drink and captain 10 and say, I'm going home to my family or captain two on.

1425
01:14:44.48 --> 01:14:46.48
No, thank you, but I'm going to go home.

1426
01:14:46.48 --> 01:14:47.48
I'll be back tomorrow.

1427
01:14:47.48 --> 01:14:49.48
You buy me drinks tomorrow.

1428
01:14:49.48 --> 01:14:54.48
And they come back and he had time and couldn't clubhouse have a drink before we go on an exc mission.

1429
01:14:54.48 --> 01:14:55.48
There's just amazing.

1430
01:14:55.48 --> 01:14:58.48
So you had this whole, yeah, that's crazy.

1431
01:14:58.48 --> 01:14:59.48
That dichotomy.

1432
01:14:59.48 --> 01:14:59.48
Yeah.

1433
01:14:59.48 --> 01:15:02.48
There with their, to fly home to her family.

1434
01:15:02.48 --> 01:15:03.48
She's.

1435
01:15:03.48 --> 01:15:04.48
And they always came for us.

1436
01:15:04.48 --> 01:15:07.48
They never, you know, we never had them say no for us.

1437
01:15:07.48 --> 01:15:09.48
And they have our teams.

1438
01:15:09.48 --> 01:15:16.48
Yeah, I know that's that's definitely something to think about because Americans, we are always fighting in someone else's country.

1439
01:15:16.48 --> 01:15:17.48
Right?

1440
01:15:17.48 --> 01:15:18.48
We can go home.

1441
01:15:18.48 --> 01:15:19.48
We can go home to employment.

1442
01:15:19.48 --> 01:15:20.48
That's it.

1443
01:15:20.48 --> 01:15:21.48
You know, there's no family.

1444
01:15:21.48 --> 01:15:26.48
What were you married during this time or were you, did you have kids during this time?

1445
01:15:26.48 --> 01:15:27.48
Did you have your, your brother?

1446
01:15:27.48 --> 01:15:33.48
Yeah, I, I'm out, I'm out in, uh, 1969.

1447
01:15:33.48 --> 01:15:42.48
And I don't remember what, if I was a set down before it or the after it.

1448
01:15:42.48 --> 01:15:43.48
I don't remember.

1449
01:15:43.48 --> 01:15:45.48
I said, I said the last time.

1450
01:15:45.48 --> 01:15:49.48
I was like, let me, let me.

1451
01:15:49.48 --> 01:15:55.48
And you must remember, uh, you know, going on a mission, getting your aircraft shot up and then going home to your wife and saying, hi, honey, I'm home.

1452
01:15:55.48 --> 01:15:56.48
Yeah.

1453
01:15:56.48 --> 01:15:57.48
Mm.

1454
01:15:57.48 --> 01:15:58.48
Yeah.

1455
01:15:58.48 --> 01:16:03.48
Every time I, the, I was shot.

1456
01:16:03.48 --> 01:16:12.48
But they, they, they, they, I think most of the, like many times they miss me.

1457
01:16:12.48 --> 01:16:16.48
Yeah.

1458
01:16:16.48 --> 01:16:19.48
One time, I feel back from, uh, hair side, back to Kwang Shih.

1459
01:16:19.48 --> 01:16:22.48
And, uh, where was the very back?

1460
01:16:22.48 --> 01:16:30.48
And we flew all, all, all about three in the team along the hillside.

1461
01:16:30.48 --> 01:16:39.48
And, suddenly, this, this, this, somebody, a, a long line of, I kind of, I kind of like it.

1462
01:16:39.48 --> 01:16:43.48
Right, right, all, all of, all of my, my year.

1463
01:16:43.48 --> 01:16:47.48
And I, I look, I look up, I look up hill.

1464
01:16:47.48 --> 01:16:55.48
And I saw, the, a lot of NVA, you know, in the Shivua.

1465
01:16:55.48 --> 01:16:56.48
Mm.

1466
01:16:56.48 --> 01:16:57.48
Yeah.

1467
01:16:57.48 --> 01:17:03.48
The front lines, the sheet, the second line, the knee and the third line, the stand.

1468
01:17:03.48 --> 01:17:04.48
Just like that.

1469
01:17:04.48 --> 01:17:06.48
And they were on the hill.

1470
01:17:06.48 --> 01:17:08.48
And they're shooting at me.

1471
01:17:08.48 --> 01:17:09.48
Wow.

1472
01:17:09.48 --> 01:17:14.48
And, uh, and I, I, I told my Kusi.

1473
01:17:14.48 --> 01:17:17.48
Shoot the back shoot back shoot like that.

1474
01:17:17.48 --> 01:17:23.48
And I saw the, uh, trigger out, you know, the, you know, the round, the, the, the, the whole,

1475
01:17:23.48 --> 01:17:27.48
the, the, the, uh, in front of the front line of them.

1476
01:17:27.48 --> 01:17:30.48
I don't know, if they, if they, they hit the,

1477
01:17:30.48 --> 01:17:31.48
I know them or not.

1478
01:17:31.48 --> 01:17:35.48
But because I was the last one in the fry and then time.

1479
01:17:35.48 --> 01:17:46.08
And so I just get primed, wait to pointy, and wait to pointy, I count, I found 49 holes.

1480
01:17:46.08 --> 01:17:51.04
He's flying from K-Son where we had F-LB-3 who had pick-up teams on launch for targets from

1481
01:17:51.04 --> 01:17:52.04
K-Son.

1482
01:17:52.04 --> 01:17:57.36
And of course when you flew in the K-Son, this is during the offensive.

1483
01:17:57.36 --> 01:17:58.68
So you know that was it.

1484
01:17:58.68 --> 01:18:04.000
So he flies from that hot zone flying to Kwong Tree, which is, quote, a secure base in

1485
01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:11.000
route, there's three lines of VNVA just practicing target, hit them 49 times.

1486
01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:17.000
Yeah, 49 rounds.

1487
01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:21.000
What happened the last time you got shot down?

1488
01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:33.000
The last time because shot down was in Budapest, north of Banyatwai.

1489
01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:48.000
And I, in so-so team at K-Son, when I K-Son, when you're in service for a long time,

1490
01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:51.000
in K-Son, you have some feeling.

1491
01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:55.000
I go to say six feeling.

1492
01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:58.000
And I feel something wrong on the ground.

1493
01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:05.000
Yeah, now in the original example, so I'm from 1500 feet, I go down to check it.

1494
01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:11.000
I had about 500 feet, they sat the suit at me.

1495
01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:15.000
And this is this when you're trying to extract them or is this during the insert?

1496
01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:16.000
I'm not going to fall.

1497
01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000
He's coming back from.

1498
01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:22.000
Okay, so after you drop them off, you're halfway home and you decide you're going to go look

1499
01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:23.000
on the ground.

1500
01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:24.000
Yeah.

1501
01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:25.000
And you start getting shot.

1502
01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:26.000
Yeah.

1503
01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:30.000
And I got mad.

1504
01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:36.000
I said, I'm going to extract fire and I skipped the line of fire.

1505
01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:43.000
And I said, man, I said, this is my land and I take care of all of my

1506
01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000
you could get your dad to suit and me.

1507
01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:53.000
So I come back and suit and I got hit again and the shot for cut fire.

1508
01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:58.000
They're around hit the fuel tank and then the fuel ignites.

1509
01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:02.000
And the fire comes from the fuel tank into the cabin.

1510
01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:06.000
He's at 500 feet trying to keep the air,

1511
01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:12.000
create a stable to land while on fire.

1512
01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:15.000
And I was on top of the frame.

1513
01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:20.000
The frames come from the camera from the cabin to the cockpit.

1514
01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:30.000
And if I land right or right or the subway around there,

1515
01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:37.000
it would be okay, but I don't want it to be a cut.

1516
01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:40.000
So I could find it like a two-wheel.

1517
01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:44.000
So your planes on your helicopter is on fire.

1518
01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:45.000
You could cry.

1519
01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:46.000
You could land.

1520
01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:49.000
But you don't want to get caught.

1521
01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:50.000
No.

1522
01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.000
Because that's going to be hard.

1523
01:20:52.000 --> 01:21:01.000
And I tried to get back to Buddha and the frame took the frame keep burning.

1524
01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:11.000
And one time it was so hot that I left all of the control.

1525
01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000
It's quite a good and cycle.

1526
01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:14.000
I left it.

1527
01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:18.000
I keep my hand in my chest.

1528
01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:22.000
When I left the cycle,

1529
01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:26.000
then the job started to dive down.

1530
01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:31.000
And I saw the round coming up.

1531
01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:36.000
And I just tell the thing in my head,

1532
01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:39.000
and his arm is over.

1533
01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:43.000
But when it comes close to the three-top,

1534
01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:48.000
the instinct of survival,

1535
01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:52.000
pushed me to grab the cycle and pull back.

1536
01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:55.000
And the job was diving down.

1537
01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:59.000
And it's just literally when I pulled the cycle back so hard.

1538
01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000
And it came up.

1539
01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:05.000
I thought that the men wrote the wood to mouth, but he needed.

1540
01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000
And I saw it.

1541
01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000
And I left it.

1542
01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:12.000
And the job was diving again.

1543
01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:20.000
So it's like a scene line in this guy.

1544
01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:28.000
And finally I make a glass landing in the open area.

1545
01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:34.000
So the handles were so hot that you couldn't hold onto them.

1546
01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:38.000
But then at the last minute, survival instinct,

1547
01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:41.000
you knew what you had to do in order to get some kind of a landing.

1548
01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:44.000
So you just grabbed those.

1549
01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:47.000
And when I saw the LZ,

1550
01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:51.000
I was flying at the 80, 80, not a combine.

1551
01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:55.000
And it was 90, not a combine.

1552
01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:59.000
And I moved this cycle to the right,

1553
01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:03.000
and pushed the right pedal all the way down.

1554
01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:08.000
And so the job at the 90, not a combine.

1555
01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:11.000
But 360 degree.

1556
01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:15.000
So quick, I thought the key, the tail boom came off.

1557
01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:16.000
But he didn't.

1558
01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.000
And it started to sail around.

1559
01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:21.000
And I touched it down very smooth.

1560
01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:25.000
And it still runs as still running.

1561
01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:28.000
So he did three and on the wheel came off.

1562
01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:31.000
And the blade came off.

1563
01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:37.000
And when he stole, I grabbed the seatbelt lock.

1564
01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:40.000
And I pulled it.

1565
01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:43.000
But in September, I kept pulling.

1566
01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:46.000
My finger opened it.

1567
01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:49.000
And for three times, I used my left hand.

1568
01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:52.000
I left elbow to hit the buckle.

1569
01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:56.000
And the legs, the lock.

1570
01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:59.000
And I grabbed the handle of the window.

1571
01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:02.000
Because when I make the cross, it ran.

1572
01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:05.000
And the window ran forward.

1573
01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:08.000
And then forward, move forward and close it.

1574
01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:11.000
So I grabbed the handle of the window.

1575
01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:12.000
Pull it back.

1576
01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:13.000
But it happened.

1577
01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:14.000
I liked it.

1578
01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:15.000
I just sit down.

1579
01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:16.000
I grabbed it.

1580
01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:17.000
But the finger opened.

1581
01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:20.000
But couldn't hold the handle.

1582
01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.000
Because the skin was burning.

1583
01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:27.000
So I used my shoulder to hit the window.

1584
01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000
And abruptly, the window out.

1585
01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.000
I just went down.

1586
01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:37.000
And so from the down, the arm of the material was came off.

1587
01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000
Or was burned out.

1588
01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000
I sat the zipper.

1589
01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:45.000
And the little part was still burning.

1590
01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:49.000
And when I rolled down on the grass, the wet grass.

1591
01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:52.000
And to put it off.

1592
01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:58.000
And after it was off, I couldn't stand up.

1593
01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:03.000
And my crew chips ran by and grabbed me up.

1594
01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:07.000
And then we did the guide me to the rescue shop.

1595
01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:11.000
You know, my three, number three came there.

1596
01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:14.000
So then you get on the number three kingby.

1597
01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.000
They get you out of there.

1598
01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:19.000
And obviously you go straight to the hospital.

1599
01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:25.000
They brought me back to the medical area of the cop in the hospital.

1600
01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:40.000
And I stayed there until 11 am to next morning.

1601
01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:46.000
One kingby pilot, one kingby pilot from Denny,

1602
01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:56.000
three of me, with the omega-nabrize, abruptly to a third few years ago.

1603
01:25:56.000 --> 01:26:01.000
And that's where I stayed for eight months.

1604
01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:05.000
And what was that process like those next eight months?

1605
01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:13.000
Oh, they, uh, amputating my hand and making sheets of thin clay on my life.

1606
01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:17.000
Because my life, uh, when I was in the hospital.

1607
01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:25.000
And the day the doctor, doctor Smith, he amputated my hand.

1608
01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:28.000
I asked him how about my life.

1609
01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:35.000
He said that he didn't know until after the, after the operation.

1610
01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:38.000
Did they amputate both your hands at the same time?

1611
01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:42.000
Yes.

1612
01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:46.000
And then what was the, what was the plan from there?

1613
01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.000
What happened after that?

1614
01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:53.000
After that I do back and four or three, before eight months.

1615
01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:57.000
No, the treatment, the medical treatment, about four or five months.

1616
01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:01.000
But after that I do make the form of two years with two years.

1617
01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:04.000
For the doctor to check it.

1618
01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:14.000
And after that, after all the treatment, the surgery back to the, with Luis Hospital.

1619
01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:19.000
And at some point, I know you had a brother that was a, a, he won pilot, right?

1620
01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.000
He's, a, he won pilot.

1621
01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.000
And what happened with him?

1622
01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:27.000
He was on the, uh, a nine to five months.

1623
01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:30.000
And it was missing.

1624
01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.000
Yes, all right, we know.

1625
01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:35.000
And 95 misses were across the fence also, right?

1626
01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:36.000
No.

1627
01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:37.000
No.

1628
01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:45.000
He was missing about about 30 kilometers north of, uh, not what they need.

1629
01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:49.000
Ten, both in ten.

1630
01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:55.000
And then what was it like when the, when the war started to kind of wind down for, you know,

1631
01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:58.000
America leaving and the communist are going to take over.

1632
01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:01.000
What was that, what was that like for you?

1633
01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:17.000
Um, um, at the end of, uh, of April, April, April, 1995.

1634
01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:18.000
Yeah.

1635
01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:25.000
One was going to came to a pilot team to say to see me and, he, he, he was my, co-fi.

1636
01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000
This is an April of 1995.

1637
01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:32.000
Oh, 1975.

1638
01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:33.000
Oh, 1975.

1639
01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:34.000
Okay.

1640
01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:35.000
Yeah.

1641
01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:35.000
Got it.

1642
01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:40.000
And, uh, he asked me, uh, what we are going to do?

1643
01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:43.000
And I say, I really don't know what to do now.

1644
01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:45.000
Is everything myself?

1645
01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:53.000
Did you, I mean, obviously, did you feel like the, when the communist took over that you were just

1646
01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:59.000
doomed because clearly you were a veteran that had fought for South Vietnam.

1647
01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:04.000
It seems like you, you, you, you must have felt like you would be doomed if they

1648
01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:07.000
completed the take over a Vietnam.

1649
01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.000
No, I don't say so.

1650
01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:10.000
No.

1651
01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:18.000
The, uh, the thing is that we, we were a desperate, because we lost the war.

1652
01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:25.000
There's nothing.

1653
01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:38.000
And, uh, on the, uh, let's see, 30, uh, April, 30, 1975.

1654
01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:40.000
I was on board over one of the ship.

1655
01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:46.000
I still remember the, uh, the sea challenges.

1656
01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:51.000
And, uh, when I heard the, uh, it was off, uh, of Wukongtong.

1657
01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.000
So you were on an American ship?

1658
01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:55.000
I don't know which is.

1659
01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:56.000
The ship is in the country.

1660
01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:58.000
Yeah, sea challenges.

1661
01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:05.000
And, uh, when I heard the, uh, announcement of a surrender from Zeno Loming,

1662
01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:10.000
oh, my, uh, my tears just came out.

1663
01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:15.000
And I want to do them over the war.

1664
01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:22.000
And, uh, when I look back and I see my toolkit, and he's told me.

1665
01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:27.000
He's told me from the B.L.

1666
01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:28.000
So then what happened?

1667
01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:31.000
I mean, now you've got your two kids, your, your, your,

1668
01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:34.000
In Vietnam, the South is surrendered.

1669
01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:37.000
What, what, what happened then?

1670
01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:45.000
And we go back to, uh, go back home and then wait for what happened.

1671
01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:51.000
And, um, in, uh,

1672
01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:55.000
Surah, yeah, Surah is six.

1673
01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:58.000
I, I, I, I, I, 75.

1674
01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:03.000
I was in, uh, yeah, they put me in the, uh, radio station camp.

1675
01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.000
In a re-education camp.

1676
01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:07.000
Yeah.

1677
01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.000
What was that experience like?

1678
01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.000
Yes.

1679
01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:15.000
This is just talked about, uh,

1680
01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:19.000
propaganda, uh, propaganda, uh,

1681
01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:24.000
and the thing is that the people who, they, they,

1682
01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:28.000
they want to, they want us to go to class every day.

1683
01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:31.000
And we have to go to class every day as they skip talk,

1684
01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:35.000
but they guy who tell a total, total,

1685
01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:40.000
this is the level of normalized.

1686
01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:42.000
Oh, my God.

1687
01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:47.000
This is likely, maybe, well, the class is already great to me.

1688
01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:50.000
So you're being re-educated by a third grade.

1689
01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:51.000
Yeah, right.

1690
01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:55.000
And they keep, and all of them talking the same way.

1691
01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:56.000
Mm-hmm.

1692
01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:57.000
This is like the machine.

1693
01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:59.000
It's just indoctrination.

1694
01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:00.000
Yeah, indoctrination.

1695
01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:01.000
Yeah.

1696
01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:04.000
How long did, and how long were you at the re-education camp for?

1697
01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:06.000
I was there for, um, uh,

1698
01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:11.000
zoolite, I don't know, from, uh, zool, to, uh, August.

1699
01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:13.000
And then how did you get out of the re-education camp?

1700
01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:17.000
Well, one time I was, uh, doing out with my, uh,

1701
01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:22.000
the other prisoners to, uh, create up as a, uh, the camp.

1702
01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:27.000
And I was pulling the, uh, bubble-wide with them.

1703
01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:32.000
And, uh, one of the, uh, one of the guys they, uh,

1704
01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:34.000
at the, uh, and they told me that, uh,

1705
01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:35.000
you keep, uh, um, okay.

1706
01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:40.000
And we have the inspection team, um, from Saigon to Camsey.

1707
01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:41.000
Hm-hmm.

1708
01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:42.000
Mm-hmm.

1709
01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:46.000

01:40:13.48 --> 01:40:24.68
organized the escape they get in touch with the local and every time they one

1760
01:40:24.68 --> 01:40:33.08
I say I went my son we were in this we have to pay a lot of six or seven the six or seven

1761
01:40:33.08 --> 01:40:41.16
hours I would go six or seven ounces of gold no no no no out oh I see uh point of

1762
01:40:41.16 --> 01:40:48.12
six or point seven hours we would go right and where would you find gold they like gold

1763
01:40:48.12 --> 01:41:01.000
the time I was I got out in the dump can the police is not in the put it is

1764
01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:09.40
in my pocket and found a ring golden ring and he says the ticket and put in his pocket

1765
01:41:09.40 --> 01:41:18.84
and my uh pipe I was he said he take it out and smoke and put in his pocket too

1766
01:41:19.24 --> 01:41:24.60
that's when you got caught the second time oh the first time you lost your gold ring you lost your

1767
01:41:24.60 --> 01:41:30.68
pack of smokes and then you tried to escape a couple more times yeah another two times but

1768
01:41:30.68 --> 01:41:40.20
after the first time I saw that my son is getting bigger I don't want him to be a son I took to

1769
01:41:40.20 --> 01:41:48.04
be calm to service it by the way to the NBA so I let him go by himself so you're

1770
01:41:48.04 --> 01:41:58.36
son escape by himself did you make it yeah he made it in 87 and me and he like that time he was 16, 60 and

1771
01:41:58.36 --> 01:42:03.16
70 so you are facing either you get either your son escapes or your son is going to have to

1772
01:42:03.16 --> 01:42:08.84
actually serve in the NBA who you had fought against for however long six years right

1773
01:42:08.84 --> 01:42:16.04
and after my son I have a

1774
01:42:16.04 --> 01:42:23.56
a mask and I brought my my daughters to escape another two times I got caught too

1775
01:42:25.96 --> 01:42:34.04
and was it punishment as severe the second two times oh the second time he said it was okay

1776
01:42:34.04 --> 01:42:41.48
but after we we can get out of a couple months after we pay about a point six a point seven

1777
01:42:42.44 --> 01:42:51.16
how was it you go where do you find gold oh luckily that my my my my my sister

1778
01:42:52.20 --> 01:42:59.56
my who passed away the early this year he sent money to help my mom

1779
01:42:59.56 --> 01:43:07.08
where was your sister I sister you find she was in France so she was able to somehow send

1780
01:43:07.08 --> 01:43:15.72
money to your mom she didn't send money she sent medicine medicine and I sell it I

1781
01:43:15.72 --> 01:43:21.96
said okay you were not having this there's no no medicine you get down and during that time

1782
01:43:21.96 --> 01:43:29.16
to your father was killed right my final lie in 63 63 63

1783
01:43:29.16 --> 01:43:35.72
okay sorry yeah I was I was the F was the day you joined the Air Force yeah but

1784
01:43:35.72 --> 01:43:39.16
you're by the way my father that my father was away that day

1785
01:43:42.52 --> 01:43:46.76
so how did you finally how did you finally get out of Vietnam and get to America

1786
01:43:46.76 --> 01:44:00.52
oh I see in 88 then I heard that the H.O. program I'm not a qualified project

1787
01:44:00.52 --> 01:44:06.04
that program you say H.O. H.O. yeah humanitarian organization currently passed in

1788
01:44:06.04 --> 01:44:14.28
yeah and it's it's helping the people who was in who was in service or who was in prison

1789
01:44:14.28 --> 01:44:20.76
in the company's prison for one and two years can come up I'd like to come here

1790
01:44:22.04 --> 01:44:28.28
and how did you not qualify for that because at the total time I spent

1791
01:44:28.28 --> 01:44:32.28
prison it's only two and half year well see need to dispense more time and

1792
01:44:32.28 --> 01:44:37.96
prison you can you imagine that after all the service could have been

1793
01:44:37.96 --> 01:44:46.04
and so I thought that maybe I would have I might be living Vietnam forever

1794
01:44:46.92 --> 01:44:55.40
so I prepare for my what I'm I plan to what I'm going to do to lead

1795
01:44:56.76 --> 01:45:00.04
but at that time the

1796
01:45:00.04 --> 01:45:04.92
side of it means the

1797
01:45:06.36 --> 01:45:08.92
first association is the

1798
01:45:09.48 --> 01:45:13.88
the mayor of Masuoka he was the

1799
01:45:15.32 --> 01:45:20.60
Air Force reticulano so this is an American Air Force retired in Masuoka

1800
01:45:20.60 --> 01:45:23.56
and he was working with the San Jose

1801
01:45:23.56 --> 01:45:32.20
he's now Vietnamese Air Force Association yeah and he the

1802
01:45:32.20 --> 01:45:39.16
South Vietnamese Air Force Association asked me to help me I seem to help me and

1803
01:45:41.24 --> 01:45:48.84
he went to Vietnam and South Vietnam and I he asked me to bring on my paper that I had

1804
01:45:48.84 --> 01:45:55.64
I brought to him and when he saw the DFC and he said

1805
01:45:56.68 --> 01:46:00.76
when he saw the what the DFC no the FC this thing was right close

1806
01:46:01.96 --> 01:46:06.36
what's that American award all the DSC got it got it got it

1807
01:46:06.36 --> 01:46:11.16
or the DSF foreign cars got it okay yeah yeah I know I got it I I misunderstood

1808
01:46:11.16 --> 01:46:16.20
okay so he saw that he saw that and but he didn't say anything but later on he said that

1809
01:46:16.20 --> 01:46:23.16
he told me that he didn't believe it because usually the DFC supposed to give

1810
01:46:23.16 --> 01:46:29.24
to a baby award to the American college so after he looked all kind of

1811
01:46:29.24 --> 01:46:35.32
a on my paper and he said that he would try and represent but he's not guaranteed

1812
01:46:36.12 --> 01:46:38.12
under percent

1813
01:46:38.12 --> 01:46:51.40
and he came back to state and he called one of the guy who worked in the

1814
01:46:51.40 --> 01:47:00.36
archive, National Archives and the that guy was he was working with him in the military

1815
01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:07.24
when he was cornered and the guy was then second lit

1816
01:47:07.24 --> 01:47:15.08
down on the corner second lit in the corner okay like a lieutenant corner yeah a little

1817
01:47:15.08 --> 01:47:26.04
the corner and so I had and they found the DFC and the FC and the FR are the

1818
01:47:26.04 --> 01:47:38.68
writer and the paper and that the FC and they managed to

1819
01:47:38.68 --> 01:47:50.04
the National Inquiry the magazine was quite bad yeah they they found the

1820
01:47:50.04 --> 01:48:00.52
before I did I I escaped okay and one pilot came to see me

1821
01:48:00.52 --> 01:48:10.68
he's a so-liner and he's a squad commander he's a molyson and they came

1822
01:48:10.68 --> 01:48:16.92
the National Inquiry but they everything that they took the camera to all year to see me

1823
01:48:16.92 --> 01:48:23.72
wow and so then they set up that program to get you back here so what year did you finally get back

1824
01:48:25.08 --> 01:48:31.80
or what did you get to America? let's see I came here in 1994 1994 yeah

1825
01:48:31.80 --> 01:48:39.000
right in Nashville what family did you leave back in Vietnam? when I left Vietnam my mom still

1826
01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:52.04
I told my nephew the descendant of my my missing more brother to take care of to come over

1827
01:48:52.04 --> 01:49:00.44
I leave it so I can go and I came here in I left Vietnam

1828
01:49:00.44 --> 01:49:17.80
on January 10, 1994 and I came at least 12 years here to on then in 2015, 1994 and then

1829
01:49:17.80 --> 01:49:21.40
what happened? did you have any family here did you know anybody?

1830
01:49:21.40 --> 01:49:30.44
no I first I leave the same house with the the chip of the the south of the video for such a season

1831
01:49:30.44 --> 01:49:40.44
there okay yeah I leave it for six months after that I moved out and then did you get a job? what did you

1832
01:49:40.44 --> 01:49:46.28

1833
01:49:46.28 --> 01:49:52.52
at this apartment okay yeah and when you made it out so you had your son and your daughter with you when

1834
01:49:52.52 --> 01:49:59.16
you made it out my my my son came here well that's right so he was already here that's right

1835
01:49:59.16 --> 01:50:07.48
but when I came here in 1994 my daughter came with me got it yeah so your son and your

1836
01:50:07.48 --> 01:50:13.40
daughter were here or your son was already here your daughter came with you and now they're working

1837
01:50:13.40 --> 01:50:20.04
and started to figure out life in America how big of a shock was that to you? I did the

1838
01:50:20.04 --> 01:50:30.60
last time I was I was sad because they hope I do nothing waiting for the what is going to happen

1839
01:50:30.60 --> 01:50:38.76
because at that time they were trying to catch a shield and see for me so as I can

1840
01:50:38.76 --> 01:50:46.60
I started so they can keep me here and it's a lot of a petition at that time I

1841
01:50:46.60 --> 01:50:51.24
could not even have a head as with a little of a petition

1842
01:50:51.24 --> 01:51:04.12
you know right and in the sixth the 1996 I got a citizen

1843
01:51:04.12 --> 01:51:10.52
in the United States you got your citizenship here in America. She's then you went to

1844
01:51:10.52 --> 01:51:18.52
set the clear fire department yeah I look for that I don't know after that I I go to school

1845
01:51:18.52 --> 01:51:24.20
for the accounting class and after one year I got the

1846
01:51:24.20 --> 01:51:33.96
is up in the Santa Clara fire department for almost three years and then I ran out of

1847
01:51:33.96 --> 01:51:43.24
the budgets and I was there and I then brought for six months and again the others are up in the

1848
01:51:43.24 --> 01:51:49.16
I-R-I-S. Oh you worked for the IRS? Yeah. Okay well suppose we'll have to figure that out. Yeah

1849
01:51:49.16 --> 01:51:57.72
he's one of them he goes from a good guy a hero to the IRS and how long were you at the IRS for

1850
01:51:57.72 --> 01:52:07.08
a form of 2000 to 2013. Totally news and that was it after that you retired? Yeah

1851
01:52:07.88 --> 01:52:16.36
and what are you doing now? Sleep and watch TV. No more prairie fire emergencies but

1852
01:52:16.36 --> 01:52:25.16
at first I was it was really morning I tried to look for the part-time job but I couldn't

1853
01:52:27.32 --> 01:52:35.56
put the part-time job so then you just had it you just hear retirement now. You look for a

1854
01:52:35.56 --> 01:52:41.32
part-time job that wasn't anything. I don't care what I want to know what's anything

1855
01:52:41.32 --> 01:52:49.16
this is maybe about four hours six hours a day. You're ready to work? Yeah.

1856
01:52:49.88 --> 01:52:58.44
Ready to work. Sick of watching TV. And you're up in this area here in the San Jose area.

1857
01:52:58.44 --> 01:53:02.36
Yeah, San Jose. She's the day I came here. Okay because we might be able to find a job for you.

1858
01:53:02.36 --> 01:53:07.16
Somebody probably looking for someone. Got it. Yeah. What the work on that? Yeah. Yeah.

1859
01:53:07.16 --> 01:53:13.24
Oh, tilt. Did I miss anything? I mean well let me rephrase that. I know we missed. I know there's

1860
01:53:13.24 --> 01:53:17.56
all kinds of stories. Is there anything else that you want to bring up? No I think those are the

1861
01:53:17.56 --> 01:53:23.72
major stories. Just the documented ones. Indeed. Because that's one thing I mean when you talk

1862
01:53:23.72 --> 01:53:29.88
when we talk when we broke down your 3000 combat flight hours. I mean we could probably we

1863
01:53:29.88 --> 01:53:35.96
you could talk for you know 3000 hours explaining what happened on all those missions. So

1864
01:53:35.96 --> 01:53:43.24
I mean just unbelievable that you were able to get through all that crazy.

1865
01:53:44.04 --> 01:53:52.04
On my friend he told me that I they couldn't believe that I still live with the due to date.

1866
01:53:52.76 --> 01:54:01.80
For sure. For sure. For sure. So tell anything else though. No I we covered the major points

1867
01:54:01.80 --> 01:54:08.36
there and you know just like that one time with the Marines need help here he comes he just went

1868
01:54:08.36 --> 01:54:16.12
there under fire and so many times his kingbees got shot up. I mean 40 50 rounds of the holes

1869
01:54:16.12 --> 01:54:24.68
of this. Just amazing stories and the men were just so many of our saw guys that are live today.

1870
01:54:25.48 --> 01:54:31.32
Thanks to the kingbeepiles period and of course the other avidus but in our case we had that

1871
01:54:31.32 --> 01:54:36.84
direct relationship with them. There were primary assets they put us in they always came to pull

1872
01:54:36.84 --> 01:54:42.20
us out. The pat walk is thing you let off with just a classic moment just captured the essence

1873
01:54:42.20 --> 01:54:49.08
of that underground intense firefight and here comes the kingbee. Not only did you come he

1874
01:54:49.08 --> 01:54:52.44
settles into a bomb career so you can get on the hill up there and go home.

1875
01:54:52.44 --> 01:55:05.24
On anything else you want to add? Well I'll tell you what it's just been an honor to talk to you

1876
01:55:05.24 --> 01:55:12.84
and thank you so much for coming on and more important thank you for your service and your sacrifice.

1877
01:55:12.84 --> 01:55:19.56
It's we won't forget it and you took so many risks. You took so many risks and you paid

1878
01:55:19.56 --> 01:55:25.48
such a price in order to save your comrades and your brother's norms and to be there for the

1879
01:55:25.48 --> 01:55:32.12
guys on the ground and we appreciate that and we appreciate the fact that you stood the line

1880
01:55:32.12 --> 01:55:38.04
to defend freedom in the world. So thank you. And during the secret war the kingbees were

1881
01:55:39.08 --> 01:55:45.88
another secret that nobody knew about. And so I thank you for doing this to get the story about

1882
01:55:45.88 --> 01:55:53.32
our heroic on any other kingbee pilots. Unfortunately many of whom we've lost. We buried captain

1883
01:55:53.32 --> 01:56:01.32
two on two months ago three months ago and our secret war had its secrets and one of the gems

1884
01:56:01.32 --> 01:56:06.68
one of the great assets were our kingbees and we slew to every day and their brothers and arms.

1885
01:56:06.68 --> 01:56:10.60
So thank you for doing that, Jaka. It's an honor. We appreciate it. Thank you.

1886
01:56:10.60 --> 01:56:22.36
Thank you. And with that tilt and on have left the building and once again we are left with an

1887
01:56:22.36 --> 01:56:28.12
example of what human beings can do, what human beings can face, what human beings can overcome.

1888
01:56:28.12 --> 01:56:39.000
Pretty amazing. Pretty humbling. Yeah. Yeah.

1889
01:56:45.40 --> 01:56:53.64
Feel like we can do more. Yeah. I mean that's pretty much the general kind of overall consensus

1890
01:56:53.64 --> 01:56:58.04
as I feel like we can do more. Yeah. Feel like we need to do more. Feel like I need to do more.

1891
01:56:58.04 --> 01:57:03.40
Anyways, I don't want to bring you over. Yeah. Like the group me and your team and team.

1892
01:57:04.28 --> 01:57:08.52
Process of trying to do more. Because I think sometimes I think you feel like maybe you're good

1893
01:57:08.52 --> 01:57:13.96
with what you're doing. Sure. Well, yeah. I don't know. Maybe maybe not. But yes, I think so. So

1894
01:57:13.96 --> 01:57:21.72
you know, he mentioned and we all know that he lost both his hands and then later on join the

1895
01:57:21.72 --> 01:57:26.76
fire department. So he was in the count and met the fire department. But yes, he's in the fire department

1896
01:57:26.76 --> 01:57:33.16
with no hands. Yeah. And by the way, I mean this is he lost his hands, both hands. And I asked him

1897
01:57:33.16 --> 01:57:41.80
about it. He's like, oh yeah, well then I went to. He was no like there was no hesitation in carrying

1898
01:57:41.80 --> 01:57:45.56
on with what he was going to do. He's just going to whatever I guess he's going to get hooks and he's

1899
01:57:45.56 --> 01:57:52.92
going to carry on. That's what he's doing. And then at the end, which kind of gives you an insight

1900
01:57:52.92 --> 01:57:58.52
to like how he's thinking where he's like, yeah, I'm like retired and I kind of just made a joke like

1901
01:57:58.52 --> 01:58:02.92
I just sleep and watch TV and he's like, man, I'm kind of looking for a part that I'm job like

1902
01:58:02.92 --> 01:58:07.48
you've got to go do some stuff. You know what I was thinking about? If somebody told you a story

1903
01:58:07.80 --> 01:58:11.88
where they said, listen, here's what's going on. I was in a helicopter. I was flying the helicopter

1904
01:58:11.88 --> 01:58:19.80
and the controls of the helicopter were burning and they were on fire. But and I couldn't hold on

1905
01:58:19.80 --> 01:58:25.16
to him. So I just let him go. And then right as we were about to crash, I just grabbed onto him and

1906
01:58:25.16 --> 01:58:30.52
I steered the plane, I just steered the aircraft, the helicopter and I got it to land and we lived.

1907
01:58:31.32 --> 01:58:37.40
But those those controls were so hot. It was crazy. Okay. So if you heard that,

1908
01:58:37.40 --> 01:58:44.12
you would think one level of the word hot, right? And there's no way that the level of hot that

1909
01:58:44.12 --> 01:58:51.000
could be explained to you is so hot that you lose both of your hands from voluntarily grabbing the controls.

1910
01:58:51.64 --> 01:58:55.96
Like that does. And then as you're trying to get your seat belt off your hands or just ripping apart,

1911
01:58:55.96 --> 01:59:04.04
falling apart. Yeah. So yeah, and that opening, that opening that I read from on the ground with the

1912
01:59:04.04 --> 01:59:09.72
book on the ground by John Stracker Meyer, it's just, it's crazy to think, you know, you, oh,

1913
01:59:09.72 --> 01:59:16.04
guess what? There's going to be two dangerous. So I'm not going to take a co-pilot or a crew chief.

1914
01:59:16.04 --> 01:59:23.64
All's I'm going to bring is a door gunner, me. That's it. That's what we're doing. That's another

1915
01:59:23.64 --> 01:59:30.20
level. Yeah. By the way, you're sitting on a base like warm, whatever. I don't know, cool. Maybe

1916
01:59:30.20 --> 01:59:36.52
you're an AC. You just had a piece of chicken or something. Like life is pretty good, right?

1917
01:59:37.48 --> 01:59:41.48
And I'm to mention these guys in Vietnam, they're like have to go home at night, like till we'll

1918
01:59:41.48 --> 01:59:48.20
say, hey, oh, cool. I'm going to go home now. Yeah. Because I think when I was on deployment,

1919
01:59:48.20 --> 01:59:52.36
I just put all that family stuff out of my brain. Yeah. I wasn't thinking about my wife. Yeah.

1920
01:59:52.36 --> 01:59:59.08
I was in just the deployment mode. I think it'll be really hard to go. Oh, deployment mode. Well,

1921
02:00:00.52 --> 02:00:07.48
singing ballet recital with the child. Yeah. You know, they say, hey, don't bring your work home or what,

1922
02:00:07.48 --> 02:00:11.000
you know, what's that saying? Yeah. Right. That's not the level right there. It's another level.

1923
02:00:12.28 --> 02:00:19.40
Check. So yes, we can do more. So yeah. All right. Well, keep yourself. Keep us. We're keeping

1924
02:00:19.40 --> 02:00:26.68
ourselves in the game. We're all getting older. We're not getting younger. But that way. Maybe some

1925
02:00:26.68 --> 02:00:33.32
of us are okay. Okay. So you're just going back in time. We've added video. There's this thing you

1926
02:00:33.32 --> 02:00:40.12
can do that freezes the frame. Right. So that's kind of what you you you you feel that you're doing.

1927
02:00:40.12 --> 02:00:45.80
Freezes the frame. Yeah. Okay. Cool. Well, when you're working out anyway, you need supplementation.

1928
02:00:45.80 --> 02:00:52.52
That's undeniable. I guess you could deny it if you wanted to nonetheless supplementate that be a mistake.

1929
02:00:52.52 --> 02:00:58.04
I think you'd be a mistake, yes, sir. So anyway, joc was supplement is called jockel fuel. So these

1930
02:00:58.04 --> 02:01:03.16
supplements include, but not limited to joint warfare for your joints, super cruel oil. Also for your joints.

1931
02:01:03.16 --> 02:01:11.88
General health. Some omega 3's in there. These are important. What I'm saying. Also discipline,

1932
02:01:11.88 --> 02:01:17.80
discipline, go. Three versions. Now three versions of the discipline powder. Do you drink powder every

1933
02:01:17.80 --> 02:01:22.20
day in the morning? Kind of yes. Matter of fact yes. And so I was thinking about this. So in the morning,

1934
02:01:22.20 --> 02:01:28.84
I drink coffee. Am I coffee drink? I don't know. Maybe maybe not. I don't drink coffee every single

1935
02:01:28.84 --> 02:01:35.32
morning. But that's like as far as morning routines go. Coffee's not part of your routine. I know

1936
02:01:35.32 --> 02:01:39.32
that. Definitely not part of my routine. But is the discipline? Could you get a workout, right? So you take the

1937
02:01:39.32 --> 02:01:45.32
discipline every morning before the workout? No. I take it before I work work. After the workout.

1938
02:01:45.32 --> 02:01:49.40
Yeah, when I wake up in the morning, I don't drink anything. I just drink water. Water, but go. Yeah,

1939
02:01:49.40 --> 02:01:53.72
that's a good one. All right, interesting. That is interesting. I just don't know. Now I'm going to

1940
02:01:53.72 --> 02:02:01.000
when I'm going to the juts on the way there on drinking discipline for your troops. I'll dare to

1941
02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:09.80
three scams actually. Well, sometimes actually four. There you go. But nonetheless, and then, um, yes.

1942
02:02:09.80 --> 02:02:15.08
So there is part of version. Also capsule version. Cool. That's when you're on the go. And then the

1943
02:02:15.88 --> 02:02:26.52
energy drink healthy energy drink version. See, this is a good one. So in this far as energy drinks go,

1944
02:02:26.52 --> 02:02:33.64
like we say, you can have an energy drink, but if even saying energy drink kind of brings along

1945
02:02:33.64 --> 02:02:40.76
the stigma of the energy drink. Definitely discipline. Go. Energy drink RTD does not have that stigma.

1946
02:02:40.76 --> 02:02:47.08
Because it is factually healthy. Truth. Truth. True. Anyway, sometimes you look at me, you want me to

1947
02:02:47.64 --> 02:02:52.84
give you backup. No, on your statement. No. And I just got that look, then you were made a complete

1948
02:02:52.84 --> 02:02:58.60
talk. Right. So you're nothing else from me to add. Yes, sir. No, it's good for you. A lot of times

1949
02:02:58.60 --> 02:03:05.88
I look at you because like, sometimes you'll have this look like, oh, let me, like, you remember

1950
02:03:05.88 --> 02:03:09.64
something. Yeah, like you want to, you know, and I just want to give you that opportunity. Oh, thank

1951
02:03:09.64 --> 02:03:14.28
you. Thank you. I always have a nice, thank you for the opportunity. Just say sometimes. Sometimes

1952
02:03:14.28 --> 02:03:20.68
you say some good stuff. Anyway, yeah. Also, Mark, these are in the form protein, protein in the form

1953
02:03:20.68 --> 02:03:25.48
to dessert. Six and one, half dozen the other. Yes, sir. Either way, we do know this. We're getting

1954
02:03:25.48 --> 02:03:30.84
something that's tasty and good for us. Good for us. And so you get to essentially just say it's good.

1955
02:03:30.84 --> 02:03:37.32
It's good because that covers all bases. Good for you. Good tasting. It depends on what kind of

1956
02:03:37.32 --> 02:03:42.28
good, because there's a lot of kinds of good and for good various things. You've been doing a lot of

1957
02:03:42.28 --> 02:03:47.64
work a lot of lawyer activity with me lately about well, it depends on what you mean by. Yeah,

1958
02:03:47.64 --> 02:03:52.52
because it's interesting. Yeah, because you can't just blanket statement a lot of stuff. Like,

1959
02:03:53.16 --> 02:03:57.72
okay, so my daughter asked me what's your favorite color? So I'm like, all right, well, it kind of

1960
02:03:57.72 --> 02:04:04.76
depends. Like, let's say black was my favorite color. But the same time, like, I don't necessarily

1961
02:04:04.76 --> 02:04:08.60
want everything to be black. Some things I want to be red. Like, I don't want to eat a black

1962
02:04:08.60 --> 02:04:15.24
strawberry. I'll tell you that. Okay. You see what I'm saying, though. A lot of these questions.

1963
02:04:15.24 --> 02:04:20.04
Okay. Like I said, you're doing a lot of these questions. Demand a little bit of a

1964
02:04:20.04 --> 02:04:25.72
little camera. Next question. Well, you'd want to eat a camel orange. Yes. You do want to. If

1965
02:04:25.72 --> 02:04:30.52
there was such a thing, if you get an orange that was camel, we just called it a camel. It said

1966
02:04:30.52 --> 02:04:38.04
an orange. All right. Well, I just think of like, what if my wife's face was camel? I'm not

1967
02:04:38.04 --> 02:04:43.24
again. That wouldn't be too bad either. All right. Well, whatever. All right. Cool. I'll simply

1968
02:04:43.24 --> 02:04:50.92
find my answers. How about that? Cool. Cool. Anyway. All these things. Jockel, few available in various

1972
02:05:15.16 --> 02:05:19.80
Police Coast January. There I said it. It's looking like January for the whole

1973
02:05:19.80 --> 02:05:27.16
East Coast. Thanks to the Floridians. It's a Florida troopers. The out there getting after it

1974
02:05:27.16 --> 02:05:32.28
clearing shelves, moving us in the right direction that we can hope for a January.

1975
02:05:32.28 --> 02:05:41.88
Full loadout. Wow. The people from Pennsylvania are fired up. If you notice that on social media,

1976
02:05:41.88 --> 02:05:46.52
people from Pennsylvania, people from Jersey, people from Virginia are like, we need it up here. And

1977
02:05:46.52 --> 02:05:55.24
this wall. Yes. Yeah. I did see it. Just in. Probe in there for sure. Yes. Good. Okay. Back to

1978
02:05:55.24 --> 02:06:03.48
origin.com. American made stuff, including geese, rash guards, jeans, American denim and boots.

1979
02:06:04.44 --> 02:06:09.80
Yeah. And you might think to yourself, oh, oh, American made jeans, right? Okay. I know what

1980
02:06:09.80 --> 02:06:15.000
that's going to be. That's going to be a $350 pair of jeans. That's what you might be thinking

1981
02:06:15.000 --> 02:06:20.28
that. Potent. You're thinking wrong. Actually, you're thinking wrong. Get yourself a couple of

1982
02:06:20.28 --> 02:06:27.72
pair of origin jeans. And listen, they're not as cheap as we want them to be right now. But as we grow,

1983
02:06:27.72 --> 02:06:37.08
as we scale, we will be able to get the price down even more. But join the, join the club of

1984
02:06:38.20 --> 02:06:46.04
supporting America. That's true. Also boots like I said, also talk with the store. It's called

1985
02:06:46.04 --> 02:06:51.08
Jocquistor. It's speaking of clubs. We have another club. It's not really a club. It's just a

1986
02:06:51.08 --> 02:06:57.56
subscription. Yeah, the club. I mean, really, anyway, it's a subscription-based t-shirt scenario.

1987
02:06:57.56 --> 02:07:03.88
I like that way better than club. I think club is something that you do. Unless you're in a

1988
02:07:03.88 --> 02:07:10.04
motorcycle gang club. Yeah. Then that's one. That's like one. Also it depends. Oh,

1989
02:07:10.04 --> 02:07:16.12
that's just sort of a real name. Right. But it depends on the word. What you mean by club. Why are you

1990
02:07:16.12 --> 02:07:21.08
being a lawyer? Because you're over here. You know, you see what I'm saying. Anyway, yes,

1991
02:07:21.08 --> 02:07:25.72
club subscription-based t-shirt. It's situation. Which you are wearing one today. Is this the

1992
02:07:25.72 --> 02:07:31.08
initial rule? Launch mode? It's the one of the ones. I would say that one's dope. Yeah. And you know,

1993
02:07:31.08 --> 02:07:36.12
I don't throw that. You know, it's around very often. It's in the wild. Yeah, but yes, yes, sir. I like your layers.

1994
02:07:36.12 --> 02:07:42.28
I don't know. And yeah, you know, these t-shirt ideas, you know, they come, they go. Some sticks.

1995
02:07:42.28 --> 02:07:47.24
I'm don't stick. But this is like an opportunity for all of us to sort of, you know, capitalize on

1996
02:07:47.24 --> 02:07:55.08
some of the cool t-shirt ideas that just fly in from time to time. Yeah. And just like the ideas coming

1997
02:07:55.08 --> 02:07:59.24
go, the shirts will come and go. Every month. I want to get one of these shirts. And they're gone.

1998
02:08:00.04 --> 02:08:03.40
Anyway, talk of story.com. That's where you can jump on that. If you want, also on

2001
02:08:15.88 --> 02:08:19.72
Yeah, make sense to me. You can subscribe to this podcast too. If you haven't done that,

2002
02:08:19.72 --> 02:08:23.24
wherever you subscribe to podcast. I'll scut some other podcast. Jockel on ravling with

2003
02:08:23.24 --> 02:08:29.96
Darrell Cooper, which used to be called the thread. Now it's called Jockel on ravling. Also grounded

2004
02:08:29.96 --> 02:08:38.60
podcast. Also worn your kid podcast. We also have a YouTube channel where Echo gets to manifest his

2005
02:08:38.60 --> 02:08:45.24
little video fantasy. All right, kids. You will always say that and hey, man, good. But when you think

2006
02:08:45.24 --> 02:08:51.80
about it, YouTube channel, you're talking about enhanced videos. Videos of weed at some point

2007
02:08:51.80 --> 02:08:57.48
started calling enhanced. Okay, maybe I made that up. But either way, they're not that many of them.

2008
02:08:57.48 --> 02:09:02.52
They're all just like the video version of this podcast and some excerpts of this podcast. So

2009
02:09:02.52 --> 02:09:08.52
technically, the YouTube channel is more you than anything. So you know, I'm just saying you put it on me a lot.

2010
02:09:08.52 --> 02:09:12.76
So I'm just saying it. It's kind of both of us. I don't know. It's sort of the outlet for your

2011
02:09:14.04 --> 02:09:19.32
stuff though. Kind of. Yeah, I guess that's kind of true. I got to see your stuff being out. You

2012
02:09:19.32 --> 02:09:24.52
haven't read any books yet. That's true. You don't. Do you have a podcast? I guess you have this podcast.

2013
02:09:24.52 --> 02:09:30.76
Technically, yeah, I guess. No, that's true. Because yes, if I want to express myself in any

2014
02:09:30.76 --> 02:09:34.76
capacity to come creatively, yeah, where is it going to land? It's going to land on the YouTube

2015
02:09:34.76 --> 02:09:41.16
channel. Like me. I'm over writing songs. I'm over playing guitar. Oh, yeah. I'm painting. I'm drawing.

2016
02:09:41.16 --> 02:09:48.44
I'm writing books. I'm just all about video. That's your realm. Yeah, you do that. Yeah,

2017
02:09:48.44 --> 02:09:52.28
you make a video or two every once in a while. Which is good. Which is who I do it. All

2018
02:09:52.28 --> 02:09:58.84
of you. Oh, yeah. Check. All right. Nonetheless, yes, okay. So I understand now. I understand when

2019
02:09:58.84 --> 02:10:04.12
you're saying it and you're correct. And I am corrected and I understand it fully and accept that.

2020
02:10:04.12 --> 02:10:10.04
Also, psychological warfare. It's an album. You know, you're talking when you make music sometimes.

2021
02:10:10.04 --> 02:10:14.68
You're just making albums. Yeah. There you go. So this is one of them. Anyway, it's not a music

2022
02:10:14.68 --> 02:10:21.72
one. No, this is Jockel helping you with each track. Identify and help you overcome any of the

warehouse somewhere and your kid's going to be crying. And why are they crying through reasons?

2037

Number one, they don't have war. Your kid. Number two, they don't have war. Your kid. Because
