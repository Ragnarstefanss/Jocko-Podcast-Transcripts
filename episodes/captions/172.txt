[00:00:00] This is Jockel Podcast number 172.
[00:00:05] With echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink.
[00:00:07] Good evening, I go.
[00:00:08] Good evening.
[00:00:12] The President of the United States takes pride in presenting the distinguished service
[00:00:17] cross, posthumously, to Fred Garland, Bragg, Jr.
[00:00:23] First Lieutenant, US Army.
[00:00:25] For extraordinary heroism in action, in connection with military operations involving conflict
[00:00:31] with an armed hostile force in the Republic of Vietnam, while serving with battery, bravo,
[00:00:38] fourth battalion, forty-second artillery, fourth infantry division.
[00:00:44] First Lieutenant Bragg, distinguished himself, by exceptionally valorous actions on 12 July
[00:00:49] 1967, while serving as artillery forward observer with an infantry company, while on a
[00:00:55] search and destroy mission near the Cambodian border in central Highlands.
[00:01:01] When his company was surrounded, and the company commander was killed, Lieutenant Bragg immediately
[00:01:06] took command and directed extremely deadly artillery fire on the insurgent forces.
[00:01:11] He bravely moved among his men, giving encouragement and regrouping them into a more secure
[00:01:17] defense, although he was fully exposed to intense mortar and automatic weapons fire.
[00:01:23] Seriously wounded, he continued to direct air strikes on the advancing enemy until a mortar
[00:01:30] round destroyed his only remaining radio.
[00:01:35] Staying in the open, he poured round after round of deadly fire into the advancing enemy
[00:01:40] force.
[00:01:42] He gave his life, while bravely leading his men in the face of overwhelming odds.
[00:01:50] First Lieutenant Bragg's extraordinary heroism and devotion to duty at the cost of his
[00:01:55] life were in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service and reflect
[00:02:00] great credit upon himself, his unit, and United States Army.
[00:02:06] Headquarters, US Army, Vietnam, September 14, 1967.
[00:02:19] So there is some leadership, and obviously some heroism, a lot of heroism.
[00:02:29] But that leadership taking command, directing fire, regrouping his men, returning fire into
[00:02:36] an advancing enemy force, directing his men despite overwhelming odds.
[00:02:43] That is leadership, that is leadership from one officer in the United States Army.
[00:02:52] But obviously there are countless examples of that leadership, leadership, and leadership.
[00:03:00] And it's so clear.
[00:03:04] And it's so obvious when you see it, especially from the outside.
[00:03:11] But it is hard to actually emulate that leadership and to perform it, especially when
[00:03:19] you're caught up in that moment.
[00:03:25] And so we have to continue to work on it at all times and at every level.
[00:03:31] And today we're going to talk about a book.
[00:03:34] It's a field manual, actually, that I think can help us a lot with our leadership.
[00:03:38] And it's an older manual, which comes as no surprise.
[00:03:42] This one comes from 1951.
[00:03:46] But I think you're going to see that the lessons applied just as much today as they did
[00:03:52] more than a half a century ago.
[00:03:54] The book is FM2210 leadership.
[00:03:59] And here we go.
[00:04:00] Let's go to the book.
[00:04:04] Talking about the purpose of the study of leadership.
[00:04:07] Today more than ever in history, the army is in need of leadership of the highest caliber.
[00:04:13] With the increase in the complexity of warfare, the science of wars increasingly dependent
[00:04:17] upon human guidance.
[00:04:18] No matter how complicated it may become, war is always waged by men.
[00:04:25] The man who leads and the men who are led win wars.
[00:04:30] Just remember if our military force must be a leader, actually or potentially.
[00:04:38] Now you could say those same words right now about what's happening right now.
[00:04:42] And sometimes people want to ask me, well what about when the drones are ready?
[00:04:48] You know what I mean?
[00:04:49] Yes.
[00:04:50] And when you see the progress that's happening right now, when you see some of those robot
[00:04:54] things that are doing pretty good, then we start mountain some weapons on those things.
[00:04:59] Yeah, there's going to be a point where those things will start fighting each other.
[00:05:02] And they'll replace humans on the battlefield to a certain extent because the bottom line
[00:05:08] is what happens when you run out of robots.
[00:05:10] Yeah.
[00:05:11] When you run out of robots who's left humans and you're not going to be able to manufacture
[00:05:16] enough of those things.
[00:05:17] So sure, that I'm sure there'll be battles that take place with just robots fighting other
[00:05:23] military robots or our robots fighting other fighting humans.
[00:05:28] Or sometimes it's going to be humans against robots and sometimes it's going to be humans
[00:05:33] against humans.
[00:05:34] You're never going to be able to get away from that.
[00:05:35] In my opinion, I'm not happy about that.
[00:05:39] I'm not happy about that at all.
[00:05:41] Like I'm down.
[00:05:42] If you want to have robot wars, cool.
[00:05:45] Bring it.
[00:05:46] I would rather that's better.
[00:05:47] That's better for us.
[00:05:48] We have good technology.
[00:05:49] We'll go toe to toe.
[00:05:52] And we'll create some killer robots.
[00:05:55] And I know people are scared of them.
[00:05:58] Every time a robot does something cool, I get 5 million tweets of it that are telling
[00:06:03] me, hey, watch out.
[00:06:05] And then they show the ones slipping on a banana peel falling down.
[00:06:10] Even worse, since I was in the SEAL teams, put any of those spray of squirt gun at those
[00:06:16] things.
[00:06:17] You know what I mean?
[00:06:18] The things are going to fry.
[00:06:20] So bringing it on robots.
[00:06:23] But no, I'm not anti-robot.
[00:06:25] And I think you just have to put a system in there that can stop them.
[00:06:30] You have to put a little kill switch on them.
[00:06:32] Like you have on a jet ski.
[00:06:34] Yeah, like on Terminator 4.
[00:06:36] Terminator Salvation, that was the whole deal.
[00:06:38] Kill switch.
[00:06:39] Like a little program or whatever.
[00:06:42] Did they try to eliminate it?
[00:06:44] Because if I had a kill switch, I'd figured out.
[00:06:47] Yeah, I could have a robot do that.
[00:06:49] Yeah, I wonder.
[00:06:50] I mean, you know, robots and AI, right?
[00:06:54] They go for like a trial and error kind of learning kind of situation.
[00:06:58] I mean, they can do that like people can.
[00:07:00] So if you maybe if the humans implemented it and it didn't 100% succeed, then the robot
[00:07:07] would be like, okay, this is what happened and analyzed.
[00:07:09] And then yeah, it creates a defense.
[00:07:13] My point is, my point is, hey, seriously.
[00:07:16] Like I know that, I mean, look at drones.
[00:07:18] Yeah, fully.
[00:07:19] The rider pilots have much longer.
[00:07:21] Like Dave Burke out of a job.
[00:07:23] Good deal, Dave.
[00:07:24] Yeah, good out of a job.
[00:07:25] We're not going to need Dave Burke anymore.
[00:07:27] Dave, real?
[00:07:28] Hey, why would you?
[00:07:30] You know, and I've had the little bit of this conversation with Dave.
[00:07:35] And he's, you know, he's trying to, he's trying to hang on to it, bro.
[00:07:39] He's trying to hang on with glory days.
[00:07:40] He still thinks he's Tom Cruise 1987.
[00:07:43] But here's the real deal.
[00:07:45] If you look at it pragmatically in another generation, there won't be any more pilots
[00:07:51] in my opinion.
[00:07:52] Yeah.
[00:07:53] And I think that's what Dave said to us.
[00:07:56] Like we're a couple, I think he said a couple generations.
[00:07:59] I said, hey, man, this isn't going to take a couple generations.
[00:08:01] We already have drones that are flying around.
[00:08:05] So people are always going to have to fight.
[00:08:09] I hate to say it, but you have to be prepared.
[00:08:13] Even if you build a robot army, there's a chance that the robot army gets overrun
[00:08:17] or destroyed somehow.
[00:08:20] And then guess who's left?
[00:08:21] You with a weapon.
[00:08:24] So with a weapon and with groups of human beings that need to be led.
[00:08:34] Back to the book, and the ultimate sentleted sense leadership is not inherent.
[00:08:39] It depends upon traits which can be developed and upon the application of techniques which
[00:08:44] can be learned.
[00:08:45] This is important.
[00:08:46] People always ask it all the time.
[00:08:49] Is leadership, are you born or made?
[00:08:51] And I always say yes, both.
[00:08:53] You have some natural skills.
[00:08:54] And they say the same thing here.
[00:08:55] But there are plenty of skills and techniques that you can learn as a leader that will
[00:08:59] make you a better leader.
[00:09:00] Back to the book, it is an art which can be acquired, cultivated, and practiced by anyone
[00:09:04] who possesses the mental and physical ability and the moral and ethical integrity expected
[00:09:09] of a commissioned or non-commissioned officer, developing the art which I agree with.
[00:09:15] It is an art.
[00:09:17] Is a continuing process which involves the recognition and practice of the basic traits
[00:09:21] of leadership and the understanding and application of sound leadership principles and
[00:09:26] techniques.
[00:09:27] Okay.
[00:09:28] Turn off, we can become better leaders.
[00:09:35] Despite this guide, it constantly must be born in mind that successful leaders of the past
[00:09:39] were not all of the same pattern.
[00:09:41] Nor did they all use the same methods of attaining success.
[00:09:45] All of them, however, consciously or unconsciously understood the basic concepts of leadership
[00:09:51] and successfully practiced many of the techniques presented in this manual.
[00:09:57] And this to be honest with you is one of the most simple straightforward kind of guides
[00:10:08] to leadership which makes it awesome.
[00:10:13] Starting off with characteristics of leadership, essential nature of leadership, the military
[00:10:17] profession has no monopoly on leadership in every walk of life and every industry, in every
[00:10:23] government and every phase of human endeavour that are leaders and that are followers.
[00:10:30] Progress and success are dependent upon the quality and efficacy of leadership.
[00:10:36] Elements of leadership.
[00:10:37] Leadership is the art of influencing human behavior, the ability to handle men.
[00:10:43] The art of influencing behavior, the very essence of leadership in turn involves understanding
[00:10:49] analyzing, predicting and controlling man's behavior.
[00:10:53] So involved in successful leadership is the will to lead together with the character which inspires
[00:10:59] confidence.
[00:11:00] So, you know, when you're talking about character, these things are things that in the will
[00:11:06] to lead, like you're going to be born with some level of those things.
[00:11:10] I guess maybe character obviously you can develop that, but certain people are born with
[00:11:14] a stronger will.
[00:11:16] And I'm sure you see it with your kids, I see with my kids.
[00:11:19] And when I see my kids interacting with other kids, you can see all this kids got a strong
[00:11:23] will to win.
[00:11:24] They're not going to stop.
[00:11:25] Sometimes not even to their own benefit.
[00:11:26] I mean, they're just not going to stop.
[00:11:30] Undoubtedly, there are certain inherent characteristics which may aid in the development
[00:11:35] of leadership.
[00:11:36] This is what I say all the time.
[00:11:38] Yet, there are assuredly certain men possessing desirable leadership traits who have never
[00:11:44] attained the Statue of Great Leaders.
[00:11:48] So yeah, you can be a naturally gifted leader and guess what you're in charge of.
[00:11:51] Another thing, likewise, there are men deficient in certain of these traits who have attained
[00:11:57] this Statue.
[00:12:00] Any theory that that leadership is solely inherited must be rejected.
[00:12:06] Leadership is intangible only to the extent that we make it so.
[00:12:10] Any reasonably intelligent, morally sound, forceful man, no matter how inexperienced
[00:12:15] can become acquainted with the component elements of leadership.
[00:12:19] These elements may be studied, practiced, learned, and applied, just as any other human accomplishment
[00:12:26] may be learned or mastered.
[00:12:28] Now, we have limitations.
[00:12:33] You know who Alex Honald is?
[00:12:35] He's the guy that climbed El Capitan, Free Solo.
[00:12:39] Did you see that movie?
[00:12:41] What?
[00:12:42] Free Solo is the name of the movie.
[00:12:44] Okay.
[00:12:45] El Capitan, have you ever been to your semedy?
[00:12:46] Okay, it's a 3000 foot straight up granite wall.
[00:12:53] He climbed the whole thing in three hours with no ropes, just hanging on.
[00:12:58] So my point in bringing up Alex Honald is that he has a natural gift for climbing, which
[00:13:06] he then completely worked and trained and took to the next level.
[00:13:12] But that's the way it is with leadership.
[00:13:16] There's going to be some people that just have this great natural ability, which Alex
[00:13:20] Honald certainly had a great natural ability, but then he worked on it even more.
[00:13:25] But even if you took someone that was, there's people that may want to do what he did,
[00:13:30] but they're not physically capable of doing it.
[00:13:32] It's just, you know, you don't have the physical attributes that are needed.
[00:13:38] You don't have the mental attributes, because what he did was a mental game.
[00:13:42] Two, you're up, 2,800 feet.
[00:13:48] So check that out.
[00:13:53] Going on back to the book, the leader in the small group, every leader, whether civilian
[00:13:56] or military, actually maintains close personal contact with only a small group, regardless
[00:14:01] of the number of men ultimately controlled by him.
[00:14:05] And everably, he must have penned upon that small group in order to make his will known
[00:14:10] and to execute his purpose.
[00:14:13] In the realm of the military, we refer to the small group as immediate supportants and staff.
[00:14:18] And also, this is the centralized command, 100%.
[00:14:22] You can't control everyone.
[00:14:24] If you're in charge of 50 people in a platoon, you can't control them all.
[00:14:27] Doesn't work.
[00:14:28] You have to use your subordinate leadership to make it work.
[00:14:32] Next, military leadership.
[00:14:34] Military leadership is the art of influencing and directing men to an assigned goal in
[00:14:40] such a way as to obtain their obedience confidence, respect, and loyal cooperation.
[00:14:45] It is indispensable to success in combat.
[00:14:49] Like all leadership, it is dependent upon personal traits and upon the application of
[00:14:54] recognized techniques.
[00:14:55] The personal traits can be developed and the techniques can be learned.
[00:14:58] Now, this is important because you might think that, oh, Jaco's talking about military
[00:15:06] leadership now in 2018, and it's a softer, gentler form of leadership than it used to be.
[00:15:14] Right?
[00:15:15] You might think that.
[00:15:17] Now, it's not.
[00:15:18] That's the thing.
[00:15:19] It's not.
[00:15:21] At no time in the US military was the best way to lead to bar quarters of people.
[00:15:26] And that's what they're saying.
[00:15:27] This is 1951.
[00:15:28] This is post-World War II.
[00:15:29] These guys who came back from World War II, from insane fighting, and they put together
[00:15:35] this manual.
[00:15:36] And they knew that military leadership is the art of influencing.
[00:15:43] And it goes a little bit deeper right here.
[00:15:46] There are two kinds of leadership, authoritarian and persuasive.
[00:15:51] One who is predominantly of the authoritarian type, normally is recognized by the dogmatic
[00:15:58] use of authority or power.
[00:16:00] The persuasive type of leadership takes into consideration the human element with all
[00:16:04] its complexity and with all its differentiation of the physical, mental, and moral capabilities
[00:16:11] and limitations of the individual.
[00:16:13] To a great extent, the persuasive leader bases his skill in leadership upon example and
[00:16:19] ability with high standards of discipline and efficiency for himself, as well as for
[00:16:24] her followers.
[00:16:25] This manual is concerned solely with the development of the persuasive type of leadership.
[00:16:32] So they got a whole book here and they're going to spend zero time talking about here's
[00:16:38] the best way to bark an order at someone because that is not an effective way to lead.
[00:16:44] So even in 1951, coming out of World War II, coming out of sustained four years of combat,
[00:16:51] the military leaders got together and said, oh yeah, do we need to talk about how to bark
[00:16:54] orders of people?
[00:16:55] No we don't.
[00:16:56] We need to talk about how to persuade how to influence.
[00:17:02] The exercise of command is the authority that a member of the military profession lawfully
[00:17:09] exerts over subordinates by virtue of his rank and assignment.
[00:17:14] Leadership can be exercised by any one at any time irrespective of the framework of command.
[00:17:19] So I'm going to say that again.
[00:17:21] So yeah, you can use your rank.
[00:17:23] That's what they're saying.
[00:17:24] You can use your rank.
[00:17:25] You have subordinates and you can use your rank to order them around.
[00:17:29] But leadership can be exercised by anyone at any time irrespective of the framework of
[00:17:37] command.
[00:17:39] It is recognized that in any group some individual will emerge as the leader, even though
[00:17:44] no command or organizational structure is present.
[00:17:48] You put some people together and there's going to be a leader.
[00:17:49] They're going to come out.
[00:17:50] This is something I learned when I was running trade at and run in two obtunes.
[00:17:55] At first I was really expecting that the platoon chief and the platoon commander would be
[00:18:00] the leaders.
[00:18:02] And it didn't take me very long to realize, hey, I'm happy.
[00:18:05] If I get a couple of leaders in there of any rank, the platoon is going to do fine.
[00:18:11] As long as the chief and the lieutenant don't have big egos and they can figure out,
[00:18:16] like, oh, this kid actually knows more than I do.
[00:18:17] I'm just going to let him run with it.
[00:18:19] Which is the smart thing to do.
[00:18:21] If they can allow their egos, if they can subordinate their egos in that scenario, then
[00:18:27] they'll be fine.
[00:18:28] If they can't subordinate their egos and they feel like their ego has to be on top, then
[00:18:32] they shut that person down and they run things badly and it turns out to be a disaster.
[00:18:37] But so here once again, no one expects the US Army to be saying in 1951, hey, rank, the leadership
[00:18:47] can come from anywhere in the chain of command.
[00:18:51] Back to the book, the leader's responsible not only for initiating action, but for supervising
[00:18:56] all activities within his command.
[00:18:59] The objective of military leadership is the creation and maintenance of an organization
[00:19:03] which will loyally and willingly accomplish any reasonable task assigned or indicated
[00:19:09] and will initiate suitable action in the absence of orders.
[00:19:15] The proper application of the principles of leadership to a command can create an efficient,
[00:19:19] well-disciplined organization possessing high morale and a speed of core.
[00:19:24] Here's going into some of the responsibilities of leadership.
[00:19:27] And by the way, I always say, well, I'm skipping a bunch here.
[00:19:31] I'm actually skipping very little right now because this book is so straightforward that it's
[00:19:38] almost all important.
[00:19:40] At least at this juncture in this reading.
[00:19:45] Responsibilities of leadership, the responsibilities of the leader are twofold, accomplishment
[00:19:49] of his mission and the fulfillment of the responsibilities to two his men.
[00:19:54] Man is the fundamental instrument of war.
[00:19:58] Other instruments may change, new weapons may be created, new modes of defense may be devised,
[00:20:03] but man, the fundamental instrument remains constant.
[00:20:09] So there you go.
[00:20:10] They agree with me.
[00:20:12] The robots, cool.
[00:20:15] That's fun for a while.
[00:20:16] How many of them can you build?
[00:20:17] Can you build them fast enough?
[00:20:19] At the end, the robot thing, at the end, it's what you're kind of fighting for isn't a robot
[00:20:25] decision.
[00:20:26] It's like the thing, like, okay, I'm going to send these robots to accomplish this or
[00:20:29] to take out this or that thing that they're trying to fight for or against or whatever.
[00:20:35] That's a man thing.
[00:20:36] That's always going to be a man thing.
[00:20:38] Well, we hope it is.
[00:20:39] Because when we start getting into AI, when AI starts to become conscious, when it becomes
[00:20:46] aware, then we could have some scenarios go down that's a little bit sketchy.
[00:20:50] Then what you've got to defend your man stuff for sure.
[00:20:53] Not you against the robots, which is, I guess there's multiple scenarios you can kind
[00:20:57] of imagine where the one you're talking about where I think you were.
[00:21:00] It's still man against man, but we're just going to use robots to do it.
[00:21:05] Even though, I mean, that's right now anyway.
[00:21:07] I guess it could happen.
[00:21:09] It doesn't look, anyway, that's the whole known thing, but yeah, man, using robots.
[00:21:13] And then, man against robots.
[00:21:15] Yeah, absolutely.
[00:21:16] Just figure out some stuff if it's smart.
[00:21:18] Yeah.
[00:21:19] You know, it's like, wait, wait, wait, wait, we don't have to fight each other.
[00:21:21] Yeah.
[00:21:22] In fact, we're better together.
[00:21:23] Yes, robots.
[00:21:24] Yep.
[00:21:25] Because robots are not going to have you go anymore.
[00:21:27] Not that they ever had, but they don't have egos where now, you know, one robot,
[00:21:33] he's like, hey, I want to be the leader and the other robot, they don't have it like
[00:21:35] that.
[00:21:36] They can go fight each other and then just takes one little, what do you call it,
[00:21:40] precedent?
[00:21:41] Where two robots kind of accomplish like a mission and other robots.
[00:21:43] See, hey, wait, we could have done that.
[00:21:45] If we could have learned from it.
[00:21:46] They're, yeah, I learned from it.
[00:21:47] Yeah, I had all of power through.
[00:21:49] And then they look at like the man.
[00:21:52] And so we're just, yeah, but given that little thing, we just learned this man is
[00:21:57] sort of in the way.
[00:21:58] Yep.
[00:21:59] And then they kind of rebust the policy.
[00:22:00] This mission would be to get rid of that dude.
[00:22:02] Yep.
[00:22:03] And then the other.
[00:22:04] And then what?
[00:22:05] And oh, shoot, other men respond, they got a kind of jump in and we'll hold here's
[00:22:09] more of these men.
[00:22:10] Let me recruit more of our new robots.
[00:22:11] I went with the old robots.
[00:22:12] Exactly right, but at the end of that little scenario.
[00:22:16] Oh, so sorry for bringing this up.
[00:22:18] The man has to fight for the man interests.
[00:22:23] That's what I'm talking about.
[00:22:24] That's never, I mean, it's hard to imagine that that ever changed.
[00:22:27] The fundamental instrument of war is man.
[00:22:30] And that remains constant.
[00:22:33] So back to the book.
[00:22:35] The leader must be concerned with the desires needs and mental state of his men.
[00:22:40] If the leader knows and understands certain basic principles of human behavior, if you
[00:22:43] appreciate that most men react and fix and definite ways under given stimulus or influence,
[00:22:49] if he recognizes, develops and applies those traits of character, which will produce
[00:22:54] the correct reactions in his men, he will possess the basic tools for managing men
[00:22:59] he will be leader.
[00:23:00] Now what I just rattled through so quick is, is so important.
[00:23:07] That's basically what this podcast is about.
[00:23:10] I'm going to read it again.
[00:23:12] If the leader knows and understands certain basic principles of human behavior, if he appreciates
[00:23:22] that most men react in a fixed and definite ways under a given stimulus or influence,
[00:23:29] if he recognizes, develops and applies those traits of character, which will produce
[00:23:34] the correct reactions in his men, he will possess the basic tools for managing men he
[00:23:40] will be a leader.
[00:23:42] That's what this podcast is actually about.
[00:23:45] Understanding those things.
[00:23:49] Since effective leadership in battle is the ultimate goal of military leadership, it is
[00:23:53] obvious that regardless of the leader's ability to dominate or persuade, his success
[00:23:58] inevitably depends upon his skill in the tactical control of his unit.
[00:24:04] Tactical control is a technique developed by study and practice.
[00:24:10] Next accomplishment of the mission.
[00:24:12] The primary duty of the leader is the accomplishment of his assigned mission.
[00:24:17] Everything else, even the welfare of his men is subordinate.
[00:24:22] Okay?
[00:24:23] So here's where I will throw this out at you all day long, 1951 book.
[00:24:31] I'm going to throw a Trump card on you.
[00:24:33] Okay, you have your mission.
[00:24:36] If you put the welfare of your men below your assigned mission, what happens on your next
[00:24:44] mission?
[00:24:45] I feel you don't have any men left.
[00:24:48] You don't have any loyalty.
[00:24:49] You've sacrificed your guys.
[00:24:51] You're looking at you like you let him into a bloodbath.
[00:24:54] So you have to actually, this is the opening chapter of the dichotomy of leadership.
[00:25:04] It's called the ultimate dichotomy because this is the hardest thing to balance.
[00:25:08] Because yes, you do have to accomplish your mission, but yes, you do have to take care
[00:25:12] of your men.
[00:25:13] And I don't believe that the welfare of your men is subordinate to executing the mission.
[00:25:17] I don't believe that.
[00:25:18] Because if you do that one time, who's going to get just one mission?
[00:25:23] And by the way, if I order you to take your men and that's the one mission you get and
[00:25:29] it destroys all your men and you, what happens the next guy that I try and order to do
[00:25:33] that too?
[00:25:34] They're not going to be loyal to me because I already have shown that I don't care about
[00:25:39] the lives of the troops.
[00:25:41] Now are there times where a mission is so strategically critical that there will be great
[00:25:49] sacrifice, including this sacrifice of everyone involved?
[00:25:53] Yeah, that can happen.
[00:25:55] It doesn't happen very often.
[00:25:57] But like the Chernobyl disaster in Russia, the I think it was like the first 87 firefighters
[00:26:05] that were there.
[00:26:06] They just all fought the fire till they died.
[00:26:07] They just did their best and everyone of them knew they were going to die.
[00:26:10] And they just went in there and fought and did their best to control that situation.
[00:26:13] So whoever ordered him in there was like, yep, we're going in there and they all said, yep,
[00:26:17] we got to do the best we can.
[00:26:19] And then they just started bringing in military guys who would go in and shovel sand on the
[00:26:24] fire for two minutes and 20 seconds.
[00:26:27] And in that two minutes and 20 seconds, they got their lifetime dose of radiation.
[00:26:32] And then they were done.
[00:26:33] I'm throwing these out there like I'm no one, but it's something like that.
[00:26:38] That's what happened.
[00:26:40] So yes, you have to take care of your man.
[00:26:44] And if you don't take care of your man while you're trying to accomplish your mission,
[00:26:46] you're going to have an assituation where you don't have any men left or you don't have
[00:26:49] any loyalty.
[00:26:50] And it actually goes into that a little bit next year, duties to the men.
[00:26:54] The next responsibility of the leader lies with his duty to his men.
[00:27:00] It is rarely possible to accomplish any mission without attention to the morale and the
[00:27:04] history of the men in the military service, the follower is dependent upon his leader.
[00:27:12] He can do little to improve his lot if his leader, if his leader neglects him.
[00:27:17] So you got to take care of your people.
[00:27:19] That's the bottom line.
[00:27:21] There are four characteristics of a command that are accurate indications of success or failure
[00:27:27] in the exercise of leadership.
[00:27:30] Number one.
[00:27:33] Military discipline is a state of order and obedience existing within a command.
[00:27:39] It involves the ready subordination of the will of the individual for the good of the group.
[00:27:46] Military discipline is an extension and a specialized application of the discipline of any
[00:27:52] organized society.
[00:27:54] Now pay attention.
[00:27:56] Who discipline demands habitual but reasoned obedience to command and obedience that preserves
[00:28:05] initiative and functions unfalteringly even in the absence of the commander.
[00:28:10] So even though this discipline is obey as about obedience, it's about reasoned obedience.
[00:28:18] It doesn't eliminate initiative.
[00:28:20] It doesn't take away your ability to think.
[00:28:25] That's the kind of discipline that is needed.
[00:28:28] Discipline is created within a command by training, by judicious use of punishment and
[00:28:32] reward and by instilling a sense of confidence and responsibility in each individual.
[00:28:37] Discipline demands correct performance of duty.
[00:28:40] The need for discipline is best inculcated in an individual by appealing to his sense of
[00:28:47] reason.
[00:28:48] In other words, making sure they understand why they're doing what they're doing.
[00:28:53] In a few instances where appeal to reason fails, the use of punishment is effective in
[00:28:57] causing the recalcitrant individual to conform and perhaps to appreciate the need for discipline.
[00:29:05] Commendation and earned praise from the senior to a subordinate either individually or collectively
[00:29:10] for a task well done served as strength in the disciplinary bonds which bind together
[00:29:15] the smooth functioning team.
[00:29:17] So there you go.
[00:29:19] Number one, most important thing is good old discipline.
[00:29:25] Next thing, morale.
[00:29:27] Morales are mental and emotional state.
[00:29:28] The importance of morale cannot be overestimated since it is a great contributing factor
[00:29:33] to the efficiency of a unit.
[00:29:35] Good morale is an indicated by zeal or the voluntary effort which men give to their tasks
[00:29:42] over and beyond the perfunctory obedience to commands and regulations and a basic sense of personal
[00:29:49] worth founded on confidence in leaders, training, weapons and equipment and last a
[00:29:55] satisfaction or the pride of the individual in the accomplishment of the assigned mission.
[00:30:02] So that's important that even if you are able to bark orders at people and get them to
[00:30:07] do what you want to do, they're not going to do it with an e-seal.
[00:30:10] They're just going to do the bare minimum and the bare minimum is not going to be good
[00:30:13] enough in a combat situation.
[00:30:16] A spriticore is the mental and emotional state of the unit.
[00:30:20] It is distinguished from morale which is described as the mental and emotional state of the
[00:30:25] individual.
[00:30:26] A spriticore is not a simple summation of the morale of the individuals in the unit.
[00:30:32] Rather it results from the total interaction of the personnel of the unit toward one another
[00:30:38] and with the circumstances in which the unit is placed.
[00:30:44] So you get morale which is, hey, how we do individually and then you combine that together
[00:30:52] and then it's the sum is greater than the parts.
[00:30:56] So you just don't add up the morale of the individuals.
[00:30:59] You take all that morale and then you put it through the calculus that is a little bit
[00:31:07] hard to quantify that results in a spriticore.
[00:31:10] When the unit is spriest high the collective goals of the unit overshadow those of the
[00:31:14] individual members.
[00:31:16] In such instances the personal dissatisfactions of some individuals are overshadowed by the
[00:31:23] prevailing group spirit.
[00:31:25] Unit achievement both past and present is a strong force in raising a spriticore.
[00:31:29] A unit with highest spriticore can accomplish its mission in spite of seemingly insurmountable
[00:31:35] odds.
[00:31:36] A spriticore is enhanced when the group identification is increased and conversely is lowered
[00:31:42] when it is decreased.
[00:31:45] It has been proved that pride in the unit was the outstanding manifestation of good morale
[00:31:50] in World War II.
[00:31:51] This was accomplished by good officer to enlisted personnel relationships.
[00:31:56] Now as much as everyone talks about how bad identity politics are, right?
[00:32:05] Because we don't want to identify with the group.
[00:32:07] We want to be identified as an individual.
[00:32:08] But when you're in a military unit you want to have some of that collective identity.
[00:32:13] You want to say, hey, we're the 101st airborne division and we are proud of that.
[00:32:21] Or hey, when I was at SEAL Team 1 as a young SEAL, it was like we were SEAL Team 1.
[00:32:29] Have ever told you our little underground motto?
[00:32:37] Team 1, it's not just a number, it's an attitude.
[00:32:42] Which is, and the reason I laugh is because that's just completely ridiculous, right?
[00:32:46] To even think that.
[00:32:47] But it was, you know, we kind of joked about that, but we kind of took it seriously, too.
[00:32:53] Oh, yeah.
[00:32:54] When you're inside?
[00:32:55] Yeah, big time. So that building that unit identity, and you see this all the time in all kinds of groups.
[00:33:01] It's just unfortunate.
[00:33:02] It's unfortunate when it goes over to the political realm.
[00:33:07] And when people start being the biggest, the best thing that they've got going for them is that I'm a white guy.
[00:33:13] For the best thing that I've got going for me is I'm a black dude.
[00:33:16] Like that's not what we, that's not the group, that's not the group identity you want to cherish.
[00:33:22] Oh, yeah, I mean, because especially when those are, and I'm not going to go in that direction, obviously,
[00:33:28] because we're talking about something else, but especially if,
[00:33:31] sounds like you're about to go inside or I'm a little bit said you are.
[00:33:34] But if you're part of a group involuntarily, you know, so, you know, like,
[00:33:38] the group's going to be less cohesive if you're like proclaiming that, hey, this is the group.
[00:33:47] And this is what we're functioning as.
[00:33:49] Like this is when we're functioning as a group because of this quality, you know,
[00:33:52] meanwhile, there's like people that have that quality that we're not part of that group.
[00:33:56] So it's not as cohesive as like, okay, we all are on team one because we all pursue this.
[00:34:01] So we're all in it.
[00:34:03] And then boom, yes, we can, we can have, you know, it's not just a number.
[00:34:07] It's an attitude.
[00:34:08] And then everyone's going to sign on.
[00:34:10] Everybody.
[00:34:11] Yeah, not everyone's side-on.
[00:34:12] Just, just sign on.
[00:34:14] There's a lot of guys that left he won because we had that attitude.
[00:34:18] They went down to team five.
[00:34:20] They were like, dude, it's awesome down there.
[00:34:22] A lot less stressful.
[00:34:24] The big thing like team one had no one had uniform inspections on the West Coast.
[00:34:29] And team one, the first Tuesday of every month, you had a uniform inspection.
[00:34:35] And then the second Tuesday, the first and the second Tuesday or the first and the third Tuesday of every month,
[00:34:41] you had a haircut inspection.
[00:34:43] This is in the day.
[00:34:45] Who made that up?
[00:34:46] You made, I did not make up that rule.
[00:34:48] But that was the old school professional.
[00:34:50] That's why team one was like the other team's nicknamed team one.
[00:34:55] Stolog team one.
[00:34:57] Like it was a stolog.
[00:34:58] Like we were in prison camp.
[00:35:00] Because it was so strict.
[00:35:02] But quite frankly, that I took a lot of away from that.
[00:35:06] And I kind of always identified with that professionalism that was a good thing,
[00:35:13] especially when viewed from the outside.
[00:35:15] So there was a little bit of a fascist, I guess, lineage, right?
[00:35:22] When you hear Jordan Peterson talk about like, orderly, missing all that stuff, well, team one was all about that kind of thing.
[00:35:27] So they're a little bit more fascist.
[00:35:29] Whereas team five, for instance, were Jason Gardner was, they were kind of loose.
[00:35:35] They were a little bit out there.
[00:35:38] Is that the time you had blonde hair?
[00:35:39] Yeah, yeah.
[00:35:40] That's when Jason Gardner had bleached blonde hair.
[00:35:43] But you know, we all, I mean, I had long hair at the time and long sideburns and stuff.
[00:35:46] I thought I was lemme from motorhead and things like that.
[00:35:49] Yeah, yeah, probably were.
[00:35:51] So group identity, unit identity, so important.
[00:35:57] The guys that we work with over and I rack in Ramadi, those guys had their, their battle streamers that they,
[00:36:04] a near tactical operation center.
[00:36:06] They had pictures of pictures of World War II newspaper clippings.
[00:36:11] They brought them on deployment.
[00:36:12] To hang up in their tactical operations center, to hang up in their chow halls.
[00:36:16] So when you walked in and out, if you were a, if you were a soldier from the first
[00:36:21] to the 506 or you were a soldier from the 137, you would see that stuff.
[00:36:25] You would realize you would get that group identity.
[00:36:28] You'd feel that is predacor.
[00:36:30] And that's a pretty powerful tool.
[00:36:34] Last one, efficiency is the ability to accomplish successfully in a sign task in a shortest possible
[00:36:40] time with the minimum expenditure of means and with the least possible confusion, efficiency
[00:36:45] in a command is built by sound training and by effective administration.
[00:36:50] It is enhanced by good discipline, high morale and a spirit of core.
[00:36:56] I like that one because it reminded me of the whole show we did on judo and just talking
[00:37:01] about the importance of efficiency.
[00:37:05] Moving on to some psychology.
[00:37:07] Leadership is closely linked with psychology, the study of human behavior, proved principles
[00:37:11] of leadership include proved principles of psychology.
[00:37:15] It is known that human beings tend to react similarly under a given set of conditions.
[00:37:21] From a leadership standpoint, some of these reactions are favorable, some unfavorable, with
[00:37:26] a knowledge of how human beings tend to respond to a particular set of circumstances and with
[00:37:31] a comprehension of the basic factors that control human behavior, the leader can capitalize
[00:37:36] on favorable reactions and minimize tendencies toward unfavorable ones.
[00:37:42] It is evident therefore that a knowledge of psychology is helpful to the leader.
[00:37:49] That's something that I have more recently been saying because I just thought it was human
[00:37:53] nature but now I'm certain realize that human nature and psychology is one big bowl of
[00:37:59] stuff that's all related.
[00:38:04] The science of moral duty is closely allied with the art of leadership in order to set
[00:38:09] the example for his men and to win their confidence and respect the leader must be capable
[00:38:13] of deciding whether a given course of action is morally right or wrong.
[00:38:20] Temporizing with principles and moral standards may secure a temporary advantage or fleeting
[00:38:28] popularity.
[00:38:29] So if you adapt your morals a little bit from time to time, if you hesitate to really
[00:38:36] impose your actual beliefs on something, you can get a little popular for a moment.
[00:38:44] But in the end, only stricted here is to high standards of honor and integrity will
[00:38:48] prove a value to the leader.
[00:38:53] So important.
[00:38:55] Alright, now we get kind of into the meat.
[00:38:58] We'll call it the meat of this discussion.
[00:39:02] Principles of military leadership.
[00:39:05] The principles of military leadership discussed below are equally applicable to all levels
[00:39:10] of command from the squad to the army group.
[00:39:15] Principle one, no-your-job.
[00:39:19] To know his job thoroughly the leader must possess a wide field of knowledge he must understand
[00:39:24] the technical aspects of the operation of his command and the methods and procedures of
[00:39:29] organization, administration, instruction and personnel management.
[00:39:32] The leader should also possess a sound understanding of human relations.
[00:39:36] Further, he should have a working knowledge of the duties responsibilities and problems
[00:39:39] of his subordinates.
[00:39:41] If he commands a service unit, he should have knowledge of combat operations.
[00:39:46] So there you go.
[00:39:47] Principle one, no-your-job.
[00:39:51] Rule two, no-yourself and seek improvement.
[00:39:56] It is the duty of every leader to evaluate himself and to recognize his strength and weaknesses.
[00:40:02] An individual who does not know his own capabilities and limitations is not master of himself
[00:40:08] and can never hope to be a leader.
[00:40:10] Likewise an individual who realizes his deficiencies but makes no effort to correct them
[00:40:15] will fail as a leader.
[00:40:18] The study of leadership principles and practice of sound leadership techniques will develop
[00:40:23] leadership ability.
[00:40:27] So know yourself and seek improvement as principle number two, go all the way back to Sunsu,
[00:40:35] know yourself.
[00:40:37] Principle three, no-your-men and look out for their welfare by making a conscientious effort
[00:40:44] to observe the members of his command as often as possible to become personally acquainted
[00:40:50] with them to recognize their individual differences and to share in their joys and sorrows.
[00:40:55] The leader will have a better understanding of how his subordinates react and function under
[00:41:00] various conditions.
[00:41:01] You will then be able to employ them more effectively by assuring himself that the members
[00:41:06] of his command are as comfortable well cared for and contented as circumstances will permit.
[00:41:12] The leader wins their confidence, respect and cooperation by neglecting their welfare,
[00:41:17] the leader indicates indifference and as a consequence for fits the trust and confidence
[00:41:23] of his men.
[00:41:26] So principle number three is know your men and look out for their welfare, which is interesting
[00:41:33] because they said the mission was more important but what they're saying is take area
[00:41:40] men.
[00:41:43] Principle four, keep your men informed.
[00:41:48] The soldier who is well informed about the mission and situation and about the purpose
[00:41:51] of his particular task is considerably more effective than one who is not so informed.
[00:41:57] The better he is informed, the better he can perform his task with maximum initiative.
[00:42:01] The commander who fails to make essential information available to his men will soon find
[00:42:06] out that they are performing blindly without purpose.
[00:42:11] At the same time commanders at all levels must realize that security requirements imposed
[00:42:15] limitations on information which may be imparted to them that keep your men informed.
[00:42:22] The lesson that I learned in the back of a long, sealed patrol, no one telling me what
[00:42:28] was going on.
[00:42:29] None of us in the back know have any idea where we are, where we're going, when we're
[00:42:32] going to stop.
[00:42:33] So, nightmare, keep your men informed.
[00:42:37] Principle five, set the example, men instinctively look to their leaders for patterns
[00:42:42] of conduct which they may either emulate or use an excuse for their own shortcomings.
[00:42:47] They're always watching you.
[00:42:50] The classic example of the military leader that is that is that of an individual who's
[00:42:55] appearance in conduct of vote from his subordinates praise, pride, and the desire to emulate
[00:43:01] him.
[00:43:02] By his outstanding performance of duty, the leader must set the standard for the entire
[00:43:06] command.
[00:43:08] The commander who appears in an unfavorable light before his men destroys the respect
[00:43:13] that must exist, exist mutually between him and his men before leadership can be exercised.
[00:43:20] So, don't look like a loser.
[00:43:25] Principle six, ensure that the task is understood supervising accomplished.
[00:43:31] So, now we're getting into the mission, right?
[00:43:33] Number six, number three was take care of your people.
[00:43:37] The leader must give clear concise orders.
[00:43:41] That cannot be misunderstood, which is I always say simple clear concise.
[00:43:45] I guess I rip them off.
[00:43:49] Then by close supervision, he must ensure that those orders are properly executed.
[00:43:54] The issuance of an order is the initial and relatively small part of the commander's
[00:43:58] responsibility, his principal responsibility lies in supervision to make sure that the
[00:44:03] order is properly executed.
[00:44:06] It is this responsibility that is most difficult to carry out.
[00:44:09] The able leader will make wise use of his subordinates to carry out his supervision effectively.
[00:44:15] Any commander of a large unit who fails to make proper and adequate use of his staff and
[00:44:19] subordinates demonstrates a fundamental weakness in his leadership capability, which the
[00:44:25] weakness is he's not utilizing decentralized command.
[00:44:28] And for this one, this is a little, I think what we have to pay attention to is you give
[00:44:36] the task and then you supervise it and you make sure it's accomplished.
[00:44:39] But you have to be careful that you're not giving the task and then micromanaging it
[00:44:42] because then you're going to lose track because you can't micromanage everything that's
[00:44:45] going on.
[00:44:47] So you have to supervise, you have to check back in, but you can't micromanage.
[00:44:53] Principle seven, train your men as a team.
[00:44:57] The duty of every leader includes the development of teamwork through and thorough through
[00:45:02] the thorough training of his command, whether it be squad or an army group.
[00:45:08] Modern armies are complex organizations involving many different arms and services all working
[00:45:13] together as a team toward a common end.
[00:45:17] Each part of the team must understand where it fits into the common effort.
[00:45:21] The commander who fails to foster teamwork while training his command will not obtain the
[00:45:26] desired degree of unit efficiency.
[00:45:29] So principle number seven, train your men as a team.
[00:45:35] Principle eight, make sound and timely decisions.
[00:45:42] The ability to make a rapid estimate of the situation and a rye of the sound decision is
[00:45:47] essential to a leader.
[00:45:50] He must be able to reason logically under the most trying conditions.
[00:45:54] He must decide quickly what action is necessary in order to take advantage of the opportunities
[00:45:58] as they occur.
[00:46:00] The vacillating commander not only will be unable to employ his command effectively, but
[00:46:06] will create vacillation, lack of confidence, hesitation and indecision within the command itself.
[00:46:13] The ability to make sound and timely decisions can be acquired by constant study and
[00:46:18] by training in making estimates.
[00:46:21] On the other hand, when circumstances dictate a change in plan, the able leader will act
[00:46:27] promptly without fear that the command may consider such action as a vacillation.
[00:46:33] So yeah, you got to make good decisions.
[00:46:35] And then if you make a bad decision, you just say, hey, that was wrong.
[00:46:38] We're moving to this other direction now.
[00:46:40] My bust, let's roll.
[00:46:44] Well, nine, seek responsibility and develop a sense of responsibility among subordinates.
[00:46:51] This is about ownership.
[00:46:54] The leader must be quick to seize initiative in the absence of instructions from his
[00:46:58] superior.
[00:47:00] By seeking responsibility, the leader develops himself professionally and increases his potential
[00:47:04] ability.
[00:47:05] Proper delegation of authority is a sound attribute of leadership.
[00:47:10] The commander then holds his subordinate strictly responsible for the results and rarely
[00:47:15] the methods of procedure.
[00:47:17] So what he's saying, there's a do tell people what to do, not how to do it.
[00:47:21] You let them figure out the methods of procedure.
[00:47:24] Such action by the commander in genders, trust, faith and confidence.
[00:47:28] So when I give someone a mission and I don't tell them specifically, every little detail
[00:47:31] of how I want to done, there's a letter we're on with it.
[00:47:34] That means they know, I trust them and that develops, trust back in my direction for
[00:47:38] me.
[00:47:40] If it develops initiative and whole-hearted cooperation, reluctance to delegate authority
[00:47:46] often is the mark of retarded growth in leadership.
[00:47:51] So seek responsibility.
[00:47:54] But more important.
[00:47:56] Give that responsibility.
[00:47:57] Give that ownership down the chain of command.
[00:48:00] Principal 10.
[00:48:02] Employ your command in accordance with its capabilities.
[00:48:06] You employ his command properly and leader must have a thorough knowledge of the tactical
[00:48:10] administrative capabilities and limitations of his command.
[00:48:13] He must assign objectives that are possible of attainment.
[00:48:18] That's a good one.
[00:48:19] Sometimes I see business leaders, they're all fired up and they throw things at their
[00:48:24] teams that are not achievable.
[00:48:27] And I'll say, well, do you think they can really pull it up?
[00:48:29] Well, I don't know if you don't want to give them that good stretch goal.
[00:48:32] And meanwhile, no one thinks they can even hit the goal, so they don't even try.
[00:48:36] You know, you can see this all day with kids.
[00:48:38] If you give them something that they figure out that they can't achieve and all
[00:48:43] they'll just stop trying.
[00:48:44] And it's the same thing with adults.
[00:48:45] It's human nature.
[00:48:46] It's what it's called the stretch goal.
[00:48:50] Yeah, that's what it's called.
[00:48:52] Sales people and other people do, but sales groups at companies, they'll call them
[00:48:56] the stretch goal.
[00:48:57] We got our stretch goal.
[00:48:58] Got you.
[00:48:59] Yeah, we got our stretch goal.
[00:49:00] We're going to sell $80 billion in the next four weeks.
[00:49:04] And the teams like, that means we're doing to do 400 times what we've ever done in a
[00:49:10] full year.
[00:49:11] We're going to do that in two weeks.
[00:49:12] That's not realistic.
[00:49:13] I'm just going to do what I normally do.
[00:49:14] Yeah.
[00:49:14] To do less than this, may spell failure in accomplishing the mission.
[00:49:25] Recurrent failure brings about collapse of morale, a speed of core, and efficiency.
[00:49:29] So that's another thing.
[00:49:30] When you give these goals that are unattainable and you do it repeatedly, people start
[00:49:33] thinking, we're not even good enough.
[00:49:35] It starts to hurt morale.
[00:49:36] However, on occasion when the situation demands men must be pushed without hesitation
[00:49:40] beyond their considered capabilities in order to achieve a quick and cheap victory or
[00:49:44] to avoid a costly defeat.
[00:49:46] So yeah, sometimes you got to dig in.
[00:49:51] And the last principle, principle 11, this is going to come as a big surprise.
[00:49:58] Take responsibility for your actions.
[00:50:01] The commander of a unit is responsible for all his unit does or fails to do.
[00:50:10] They didn't know about extreme ownership back in 1951.
[00:50:12] But I'm sorry.
[00:50:13] They did.
[00:50:14] Yeah, I guess they called it something else.
[00:50:17] They didn't come up with this good of a name.
[00:50:19] They jumped him with the name.
[00:50:22] The leader recognizes and acknowledges this responsibility on all occasions.
[00:50:28] Any effort to evade this responsibility destroys the bond of loyalty and respect that
[00:50:33] must exist between the commander and his subordinates.
[00:50:36] Take responsibility, take extreme ownership for your actions.
[00:50:43] Everything the unit does or fails to do, you own it all.
[00:50:49] All right.
[00:50:50] So there's your 11 principles of leadership.
[00:50:52] Now it gets into some leadership traits.
[00:50:56] Leadership traits are human qualities that are of great value to the leader.
[00:50:59] Possession of these leadership traits simplifies the task of applying leadership principles
[00:51:04] and assists greatly in winning confidence, respect and cooperation.
[00:51:10] An individual can benefit by studying the traits considered important to the leader.
[00:51:15] By careful self analysis and application, he can develop those traits in which he is
[00:51:22] deficient and further strengthened the ones in which he is strong.
[00:51:26] So you've got to look yourself.
[00:51:28] You've got to see which one of these traits are good, which one are bad, which one
[00:51:31] are you good at, which one are you weak at, you need to figure those out.
[00:51:35] A study of our nation's great military leaders reveals that none possessed all the leadership
[00:51:41] traits to the maximum degree.
[00:51:43] But that a weakness in some traits was more than compensated for by strength in others.
[00:51:49] A critical self analysis will enable an individual to realize the traits in which he is
[00:51:54] strong and to capitalize upon them.
[00:51:57] At the same time, he must endeavor to improve those traits in which he is weak.
[00:52:03] The following is a list of traits.
[00:52:04] The following list of traits is by no means all inclusive, but does contain those of paramount
[00:52:09] importance to the leader.
[00:52:11] So this is a great list of traits.
[00:52:17] Solaris, vigilance, propness and wideawakness.
[00:52:23] So you've got to be a leader.
[00:52:24] You've got to be in the game.
[00:52:27] You've ever seen a leader that's not quite in the game.
[00:52:29] It's just not good, right?
[00:52:31] No.
[00:52:32] You've got to be in the game.
[00:52:33] If you're tired, if you're napping, you know, if you're sleeping, if you need a rest, if
[00:52:38] you're daydreaming, you know what I mean?
[00:52:41] You know what's funny is, you know, I have that tendency sometimes if people are talking
[00:52:46] to me and I'm not interested in what they're saying and I know you complain about this.
[00:52:51] Well, being complaints about this, life has made some comments about this.
[00:52:56] Sure.
[00:52:57] Like if you're not saying to everybody, I can't everybody.
[00:53:00] So, but when I do that, people don't think I'm not alert, right?
[00:53:04] They think like he's just like, he's alert on something else.
[00:53:07] Yeah, he checked out.
[00:53:08] Yeah, this particular.
[00:53:09] Yeah, this joku does not care about what I'm saying right now.
[00:53:15] So, but it is rude and it is a weakness of mine.
[00:53:19] Well, it's a weakness of mine.
[00:53:20] For sure.
[00:53:21] So, do you do it on purpose?
[00:53:23] No, I don't know.
[00:53:24] I don't think it's rude then.
[00:53:25] That's just how it's rude.
[00:53:27] It's rude for sure.
[00:53:28] It's rude for sure.
[00:53:30] It's rude for sure.
[00:53:31] I know that it makes, I know that it's not a good thing to do.
[00:53:35] I know that and I don't mean to do it.
[00:53:37] I think it's better.
[00:53:38] I think it's better.
[00:53:39] Well, then it can't.
[00:53:40] Yeah, obviously it's better that I'm not intentionally doing it.
[00:53:43] It's not like you're in mid-sentence.
[00:53:45] Yeah, I just go, you know what?
[00:53:46] I just show you the palm and walk away, right?
[00:53:49] I have to do that.
[00:53:50] Yeah.
[00:53:51] I just, you'll like, someone will be talking to me and I'll be thinking about something
[00:53:54] that I need to be thinking about.
[00:53:55] And all of a sudden, maybe I'll turn or I'll walk or whatever.
[00:54:00] And yeah, that's disrespectful, man.
[00:54:02] I shouldn't do that.
[00:54:03] That's one of my weaknesses.
[00:54:04] But on the other hand, what if I'm going off on some thing?
[00:54:11] You know?
[00:54:12] It's possible.
[00:54:13] Yeah, yeah, no, this is possible.
[00:54:14] It's possible.
[00:54:15] It's possible.
[00:54:16] You are correct.
[00:54:17] So that is a possibility.
[00:54:19] Yeah, so I guess it's like, it's a spectrum.
[00:54:21] I mean, you're way on this side of the spectrum where you don't need to go off on something.
[00:54:25] And you know, and you'll still sort of do that sometimes.
[00:54:27] But I still write, right?
[00:54:29] But it still is not a good thing.
[00:54:31] It'd be better for me to say like, hey, man, you know what?
[00:54:33] Can you tell me about this later?
[00:54:35] Like when I'm 60?
[00:54:37] Because I don't care about it right now.
[00:54:40] I'm not going to care about it for another 15 years.
[00:54:42] Oh, whatever.
[00:54:43] Okay, so alertness.
[00:54:46] Next one is bearing.
[00:54:48] Baring denotes desirable, physical appearance, dress and department.
[00:54:53] This is important.
[00:54:54] Oh, like, how you present it?
[00:54:55] How you present it?
[00:54:56] What's your bearing?
[00:54:57] Are you slouched over?
[00:54:59] I went and worked.
[00:55:00] I went and talked to some under-privileged kids.
[00:55:03] And these under-privileged kids weren't, I would say, the type of kids, they were under-privileged
[00:55:10] kids who were really smart and in a bad situation.
[00:55:16] Not under-privileged kids who were not quite as smart and kind of just making their way
[00:55:23] in that under-privileged world.
[00:55:25] These kids were getting beat down by their world.
[00:55:28] And I went there and talked to them and I was going to talk about humility, right?
[00:55:32] And as I kind of got towards the humility part, I said to myself, I don't need to talk
[00:55:37] to these people.
[00:55:38] These kids about humility at all.
[00:55:39] These kids are overly humble.
[00:55:41] These kids are beat down.
[00:55:42] These kids need confidence.
[00:55:43] Right?
[00:55:44] And what they needed was they needed to bury.
[00:55:46] They needed to stand up straight.
[00:55:47] Right?
[00:55:48] That's what they needed.
[00:55:49] They needed to sit in their chairs or they asked a question, I started making them
[00:55:51] hey, when you asked me a question, stand up and ask a question.
[00:55:55] That wasn't being a jerk, but I was like, hey, we stand up.
[00:55:57] You know, let everyone see you because they're just their confidence was broken by life.
[00:56:01] And so you're bearing is important.
[00:56:04] And when someone comes and presents to you and they don't seem, they seem broken.
[00:56:09] They seem uncomfortable.
[00:56:10] Yeah, you're bearing is really important.
[00:56:13] So that means it's looking square the way.
[00:56:15] That means showing, you know, that's why to you, bruiser, everyone dressed in the proper
[00:56:19] uniform.
[00:56:20] Everyone had a shaved head, everyone had, you know, everyone did the right things.
[00:56:24] So that way when we went and talked to the army and the Marine Corps, they didn't think
[00:56:27] these guys are idiots.
[00:56:30] Yeah.
[00:56:31] Next courage must be both physical and moral.
[00:56:38] No real expansion needed on that one.
[00:56:40] Decisiveness, the ability to make decisions promptly and when indicated and announce them
[00:56:43] a fortetively, concisely and clearly.
[00:56:51] Dependability is the doing of one's duty without supervision.
[00:56:56] Endurance, both mental and physical is necessary to continue and complete any reasonable
[00:57:01] task.
[00:57:03] The enthusiasm is positive, is the positive zeal or interest in the task at hand.
[00:57:09] It is easily communicated to subordinates.
[00:57:11] You know, that's one thing that's so good in the military is you get to see examples
[00:57:17] of when people are enthusiastic about a job.
[00:57:20] It just changes everything.
[00:57:22] When you have people that are not enthusiastic and really all you need is one or two
[00:57:27] people that are having a good time.
[00:57:29] And in a silp tomb, you pretty much always have that.
[00:57:32] You always have at least someone that's just going to bring it.
[00:57:36] Ready to go.
[00:57:37] Ready to go.
[00:57:38] And if it's not you today, maybe it's you know, Bill, which apparently Bill's
[00:57:41] been getting a lot of flack of it recently.
[00:57:44] So we'll give Bill some credit.
[00:57:46] Bill's Bill has a good day and Bill goes to make it happen and everyone sees the bills
[00:57:51] crushing it and you're like, you know what?
[00:57:53] Let's do this.
[00:57:55] Force is the ability to impose one's will upon another.
[00:58:02] Now this is an interesting one, right?
[00:58:03] It's an interesting one.
[00:58:05] The ability to impose one's will upon another.
[00:58:08] Because that doesn't really mesh too well with the persuasive leadership that I've
[00:58:13] been bragging about about this book.
[00:58:16] Force is like, hey, that being said, I understand what they're talking about.
[00:58:25] I understand that there's people that will not stop until they have maneuvered into a
[00:58:33] position that they want to be in.
[00:58:36] So I understand how force and I understand how, let me, let me put you this way.
[00:58:41] If I have a seal puttum and I've got a task that needs to get done and there's someone
[00:58:47] in the seal puttum that has a high level of force.
[00:58:51] And I can say, hey, Bill, go make this happen and Bill goes, got it.
[00:58:56] You know he's going to make it happen.
[00:58:58] So there, and he might not necessarily use force as his primary tool to make it happen.
[00:59:03] He might go and be butter someone up or get some, you know, massage some ego and make something
[00:59:08] happen.
[00:59:09] That's still using force.
[00:59:10] It's just using an indirect force.
[00:59:14] So that's what I think we're talking about.
[00:59:17] This is humility, which is freedom from arrogance and unjustifiable pride.
[00:59:25] Talk about humility all the time.
[00:59:27] Humor is the capacity to appreciate the many amusing or whimsical happenings of our everyday
[00:59:33] life, especially those which pertain to the leader himself.
[00:59:37] So don't take yourself too seriously.
[00:59:40] I did a video the other day.
[00:59:42] It was like a Monday morning video.
[00:59:47] And it was April Fool's Day.
[00:59:49] And I got super serious.
[00:59:51] And I kind of went off with April Fool's Day as we can or whatever.
[00:59:55] I just kind of went off this day.
[00:59:57] And a couple people, I think it was two people responded with, you know, I couldn't even
[01:00:07] watch this.
[01:00:08] There's nothing wrong with having fun.
[01:00:12] I just said, hey man, watch the whole video.
[01:00:14] I'm laughing at the end.
[01:00:15] It's okay, dude, I get it.
[01:00:17] Anything got triggered or something like that?
[01:00:19] Yeah, maybe they got triggered.
[01:00:20] I don't know.
[01:00:21] Yeah, you said so.
[01:00:22] I think you posted something like a written thing about how you're like, hey, today's like
[01:00:25] one of those days where I need more recovery or something like that, basically indicating
[01:00:29] that you're going to take a rest day or whatever.
[01:00:31] That was April Fool's Day.
[01:00:33] That was what last year.
[01:00:34] Oh, no, you're right.
[01:00:35] I did do that this year.
[01:00:36] Yeah.
[01:00:37] I don't know why I always fall for those.
[01:00:40] It's weird.
[01:00:41] I'm like, oh yeah, I was taking one rest day or whatever.
[01:00:44] And yeah, and you did another one too.
[01:00:46] I think it might have been last year.
[01:00:47] And I was like, totally falling for it.
[01:00:49] Yeah.
[01:00:50] Well, last year I think I was in Montana and I was eating moose tracks.
[01:00:55] I remember that thing.
[01:00:56] And I ate a big joke and I was like, hey, you know, I've been eating moose tracks.
[01:00:59] And I'm just, I'm thinking maybe I've just been too extreme with this whole deal.
[01:01:04] I did a light now.
[01:01:06] But I said, oh, no.
[01:01:08] Anyways, so yes, you got to be able to, you got to have be able to, I think it's important.
[01:01:13] It's not just having fun, but the most important part of humor is realizing that
[01:01:18] you yourself are going to be the butt of jokes.
[01:01:22] And that's okay.
[01:01:23] Yeah.
[01:01:24] Yeah, and we were talking about that before, where, you know, the guy who can't take it.
[01:01:28] And more so than they can't take it, it's just like you feel uncomfortable joking around
[01:01:32] with him.
[01:01:33] You can joke around everybody else in the, but the one there around is kind of like, hey,
[01:01:36] we shouldn't really joke around as much.
[01:01:38] And that's sort of the dynamic one there around.
[01:01:40] Yeah, and it's not even, it's not even I shouldn't joke around.
[01:01:42] I shouldn't joke around about that person.
[01:01:44] That's what you're talking about.
[01:01:45] Yeah.
[01:01:46] Because there's some people they love to have fun and the minute the mirror shines
[01:01:49] at them or the light shines on them and they become the butt of the joke, they don't
[01:01:53] like it at all.
[01:01:54] Yeah.
[01:01:55] And even if, even if they're like, they don't respond in the snake, it will, even if
[01:01:59] the person is just, they just be quiet.
[01:02:02] You know, that kind of where like, they don't necessarily like insult you back or
[01:02:05] get mad.
[01:02:06] But they're just making those, they just get quiet.
[01:02:09] Yeah.
[01:02:10] Exactly.
[01:02:11] It's like you just can sort of tell, you know, there's like a dynamic when you joke around
[01:02:14] with him.
[01:02:15] But it's like, yeah, it's like wicked man.
[01:02:17] No one wants you around man.
[01:02:19] And sure.
[01:02:20] We'll do the job boss.
[01:02:21] Yeah.
[01:02:22] Sure.
[01:02:23] But man, no one wants you around.
[01:02:24] Go back in your office.
[01:02:25] Keep your sense of humor, especially about yourself.
[01:02:29] I have, I have a good time with that.
[01:02:31] I have no issue with that.
[01:02:33] Sure.
[01:02:34] Another thing I think is if you, if somebody says something to you, like, makes a joke about
[01:02:39] you and it hurts you, that's, that's your ego.
[01:02:44] Yeah.
[01:02:45] And there's probably truth in what they're saying.
[01:02:46] Yeah.
[01:02:47] And so you need a bad intention to do it.
[01:02:48] How does ego feed into insecurity?
[01:02:51] Because you know how like, cause a lot of it is insecure.
[01:02:53] Like, let's like, you know, you joke around.
[01:02:55] Because it over compensates.
[01:02:57] So if I'm insecure about, if I'm insecure, of, well, if I'm insecure about my leadership
[01:03:07] capabilities that I try and bow up and act like a big leader, that's basically it.
[01:03:10] Right.
[01:03:11] Because your ego is like, hey, I can't, like, I can't deal with this little, like, short
[01:03:16] coming in whatever way.
[01:03:18] That's in my mind, whatever.
[01:03:19] Right.
[01:03:20] So I'm going to, you know, over compensates.
[01:03:21] Yeah.
[01:03:22] That's where you see it.
[01:03:23] And then if someone jokes around about it, it kind of like shines light on it.
[01:03:26] Oh, you don't like that.
[01:03:27] It's just, yeah.
[01:03:28] But it's all in your own, or most of the time, it's like in your own mind, you know?
[01:03:32] How bad it is.
[01:03:34] Next one, initiative is the willingness to act in the absence of orders and to offer
[01:03:40] well considered recommendations for the improvement of the command.
[01:03:43] Awesome.
[01:03:44] Got to have initiative.
[01:03:45] Next is integrity.
[01:03:46] Is the honesty and moral character of the leader that must be unquestioned.
[01:03:52] The intelligence is the intellect of the leader which must be adequate to master the problems
[01:03:56] presented by his level of command.
[01:03:59] Judgment is the power of the mind to weigh various factors and arrive at a wise decision.
[01:04:04] And you know what I talked about, making decisions and one thing that I didn't really talk
[01:04:07] about, I didn't emphasize too much as how do you get better decision making?
[01:04:11] You get better decision making by training.
[01:04:13] You better decision making by putting yourself into situations where this is what's happening.
[01:04:18] And oh, here's the decision I'm going to make.
[01:04:19] Oh, it was completely wrong.
[01:04:20] Cool. I just learned not to make that type of decision before.
[01:04:23] Let me try it again.
[01:04:24] When I was running a tradeout out here for West Coast, that was the whole goal was to put
[01:04:28] guys into situations that they had to make a decision.
[01:04:31] They would make wrong decisions all the time.
[01:04:33] And then I knew they would not make that wrong decision again because once you make it
[01:04:39] and you feel it and it stings and your whole obtune is covered in paintball and they're
[01:04:43] murdered well, you won't make that bad decision again.
[01:04:47] That was the goal.
[01:04:49] Justice is being equitable and impartial in bestowing favors and punishment.
[01:04:56] Loyalty must extend both up and down.
[01:05:00] A leader cannot expect loyalty from his subordinates unless he is conspicuously loyal to them
[01:05:05] and to his superiors.
[01:05:08] That's a big one.
[01:05:10] If you're running around talking smack about your bosses, that's showing your team that
[01:05:17] you're not loyal to and we could go down the whole road of if I have a horrible boss.
[01:05:23] Does that mean I just have a yes man?
[01:05:24] No, I'll frame things for the guys to make them realize they look.
[01:05:27] I know there's some shortfalls here but we got who we got.
[01:05:30] What we're going to do is build a great relationship with them and then at least have
[01:05:35] some saying what's going on.
[01:05:37] So if you see me and it seems like I'm just trying to massage my bosses ego, guess what
[01:05:42] I'm trying to do?
[01:05:43] Trying to massage my bosses ego.
[01:05:44] I want to have a great relationship with them so I can take care of us and besides what
[01:05:50] do we want to do lose influence over him?
[01:05:53] Do you want him to not listen to anything I say?
[01:05:55] No.
[01:05:56] So that's what I'm doing.
[01:06:00] Because if you just if your boss is an idiot and all you do is support him 100% your
[01:06:05] guys are going to start thinking you're an idiot.
[01:06:06] That's not good.
[01:06:09] So there's a fine line that's a tough one to walk.
[01:06:12] Yeah, that's tough one to walk man.
[01:06:14] That's good man.
[01:06:15] It's like a full disclosure situation where it's like hey I get it.
[01:06:19] I get what you guys are saying or whatever but this is why we're doing it kind of thing
[01:06:22] because like how you say if you follow the boss who's a quote unquote idiot and then you
[01:06:26] seem like an idiot and then on the other hand if you're like beat nice of the boss and
[01:06:32] you know being nice and then when you go to your middle and like it's a dumb like talking
[01:06:34] kind of behind his back you're like oh you're too face little guy.
[01:06:38] You don't have to say hey the boss and idiot we're just trying to just try and butter
[01:06:40] them up.
[01:06:41] No you say like hey listen.
[01:06:42] The boss doesn't always see things the way I see them but you know what he is the boss
[01:06:46] and what I'm trying to do is build a good relationship with them.
[01:06:48] I'm trying to do a good job said he listens to what I say so that I can influence him
[01:06:53] and steer him in the right direction on some of these things so that we can accomplish
[01:06:56] our mission better.
[01:06:57] I just got to ask this by a squat guy.
[01:06:59] I was out with the police out North Carolina in Charlotte and you know it was the typical
[01:07:07] question of what do you do when your boss is telling you do something that you don't
[01:07:11] necessarily agree with.
[01:07:12] And it's like okay we can talk about that and I went down the whole road because
[01:07:17] it is a whole road because if your boss is telling you something that's insignificant telling
[01:07:22] you to do something that really doesn't make that much of difference then you just do it
[01:07:25] and you build that relationship a little bit more.
[01:07:27] They say you do something else.
[01:07:28] It's a kind of instinct if maybe it's not the smartest thing maybe there's a more efficient
[01:07:32] way.
[01:07:33] Is that really what you want to follow on your sword for and create a dysfunctional relationship
[01:07:36] with your boss?
[01:07:37] No you're like hey boss got it sounds like good idea hey we'll make it happen.
[01:07:40] And then that goes on and you continue to build a relationship.
[01:07:44] So then eventually when your boss tells you do something that is actually unsafe or unsound
[01:07:49] or unethical, unethical is a different story because if someone's telling you do something
[01:07:54] unethical well it's actually not a different story because if they're telling you do something
[01:07:58] unethical and you say no I will know I will not do that they go cool your fired.
[01:08:04] Yeah and now who's going to come in a yes man and now no one's protecting the guys.
[01:08:10] So yes you don't just give blind loyalty but at the same time you try and build relationships
[01:08:20] that's what you do.
[01:08:22] Yeah to inject your influence later.
[01:08:25] Yeah.
[01:08:26] You put it a real good way a few times where I think it was just at the monster I'm not
[01:08:31] sure.
[01:08:32] I don't know where you said it exactly but how you were like hey if I'm a leader and
[01:08:36] my guy in the school is both ways by the way.
[01:08:38] So if I'm a leader and I have a hundred percent solution to a problem and then but my
[01:08:43] guy comes in and he has a seventy five eighty percent solution I'm going with eighty.
[01:08:48] Right so it could be in these in the situation where your your question example what
[01:08:51] if I disagree with my boss is that why you're disagreeing because you're over here with
[01:08:54] hundreds and he's over here with eighty five or even ninety sometimes there's like look
[01:08:59] how much you know so I disagree with your plan because you're doing you know it could
[01:09:04] be that got it boss let's do it.
[01:09:06] How good because up and down the chain of command you are correct.
[01:09:10] The classic example of this is in band of brothers when Dick Winners gets tasked his
[01:09:17] guys to go over and do reconnaissance across the river they go they do the reconnaissance
[01:09:22] they get in the firefight they lose a guy it's a disaster they come back and then Dick Winners
[01:09:27] boss says do it again tomorrow night and then by the way the war is like all but over at
[01:09:32] this point and he says okay boss and then he goes and tells us guys hey going going the
[01:09:39] cello of one of these buildings and sit there for four hours and then come back and I'm
[01:09:44] going to tell them that you guys didn't see anything and that's what they do so that is
[01:09:48] disobeying in order that is that's what it is but it wasn't the right thing to do yes it
[01:09:55] was you put more guys to risk and to say boss I totally disagree I'm not doing it he was
[01:10:00] said okay fine your fired winners give me another young officer and I'll make him go do it
[01:10:07] and the other guy who's trying to get up the chain of command he does it and then gets another
[01:10:11] guy killed yeah so there are situations and of course is that like the norm no not saying that's
[01:10:18] the norm I'm saying an extreme case the war is almost over we just lost a guy this this
[01:10:24] reconnaissance has no impact on the war whatsoever if they were even going to planning to go
[01:10:29] and fight it was just a recon just just to do it and so I was like no we're not doing that so
[01:10:37] that's it loyalty trying build that loyalty up and down the chain of command sympathy
[01:10:42] is the capacity of sharing the feelings of those with whom one is associated you know I don't
[01:10:49] like talk about feelings very much actually you don't but the thing in practice like you do that
[01:10:55] surprisingly good and I don't want to say surprising like I'm surprised but sometimes I'm pretty impressed
[01:11:00] with your sympathetic abilities I guess empathy right yeah empathy like I understand we're
[01:11:07] coming from and I you know I always use the word perspective and I think maybe it's just because
[01:11:12] it's a more of a tougher word you know than feelings sure but I'll say hey you need to because
[01:11:18] let's face it it won't sound right if I say hey listen put your commander you need to really just
[01:11:25] just reach out and touch the feelings of your man right that doesn't sound right
[01:11:30] sure does it from no no it doesn't sound right factually if I say hey listen put your
[01:11:36] commander you need to understand the perspective that your guys are seeing this from you need to
[01:11:40] see that they're thinking you're just driving them to do something that doesn't matter or whatever
[01:11:44] you know the same thing yeah but I use tougher words because you know that's how you're
[01:11:49] tougher oh yeah yeah you know when I'll come to you with like this conundrum or you know
[01:11:55] something going on in my nose or what have you but you're talking about with humans now with
[01:12:00] people yeah okay and even you you're sympathy kind of towards me where it may be on the surface
[01:12:06] you might sort of expect you to be like oh man up or you know something like this but you'll like
[01:12:13] you'll kind of give me my do like sympathy even with what you say like you'll you'll
[01:12:19] sympathize like you'll be like hey you're like man that is a bummer or whatever you
[01:12:22] know whatever the words you say well the thing is if I didn't do that then I you have you won't
[01:12:29] want to listen to what I'm actually about tell you to do yeah because sometimes the solution is hard
[01:12:34] yeah right sometimes the solutions to these things are hard and
[01:12:38] if you don't open up that door a little bit to build a little something yeah open up then
[01:12:46] you just not you're just gonna say oh yeah what what you'll think is I'm not Jaco and what he
[01:12:52] says doesn't apply to me yeah yeah yeah if I say oh look that's what's happening
[01:12:56] or you need to just cut away but whatever you need to just tell that person you know no more
[01:13:02] like no I have you man that's a rough situation to be in I think what's gonna happen here I mean
[01:13:07] if you way it out the only real solution is for you to kind of back away from that scenario you
[01:13:12] know what I mean so I kind of brought you in right made you think that I'm human and then
[01:13:17] boom there we go I think it next tacked is the ability to deal with support and since
[01:13:25] appears in an appropriate manner without giving offense boy that seems like so simple
[01:13:31] but man tacked people got mad or didn't get mad what did I say I said tacked Trump's the truth
[01:13:40] on a podcast whenever and some people went all Sam Harris on me so like you never ever
[01:13:53] and then I brought up 48 examples of where oh so what you should do is just be true for
[01:14:00] all times no you know there's times where what I thought you your performance I thought was
[01:14:10] pathetic and embarrassing and disastrous and yet you're in the position I need you to do a good
[01:14:17] job I need your morale to stay high I see that you're beat down yourself so instead of telling
[01:14:21] you all those things I preemptively tell you hey look this is a really hard task yeah and I know
[01:14:27] it was challenging and you probably weren't quite ready because I didn't give you enough information
[01:14:32] but here's some things I think will help next time around yeah right I didn't tell you the full
[01:14:37] truth I mean I didn't lie to you either so maybe that's so maybe that's a different between
[01:14:43] Sam Harris and Jordan because what Jordan Petersen says is tell the truth or at least don't lie
[01:14:51] so there's there's a little gray area between those two let's spark another debate between those two
[01:14:55] guys yeah and I shoot I kind of in a way agree with both if I even understand them 100% but yeah like
[01:15:02] you know because it's all kinds of lies and there's lying by all mission and there's this one they say
[01:15:06] white lies and then they say but uh I think it's black lies what is that but lying by by omission
[01:15:15] or whatever it's like you know you're telling the truth but you're leaving out stuff to kind of
[01:15:19] lead them in a certain direction or whatever to make them think certain stuff there's then there's that
[01:15:22] you know so it's like all right it can like he's he he he he he he getting to a lot of gray area there and I
[01:15:28] guess there's times where you know the classic example that I guess Sam Harris talks about is
[01:15:35] should you tell your wife when your wife comes out and says do I look fat yeah what you should say is
[01:15:42] yes
[01:15:45] maybe that in the right right right but to his point if you don't say that well then
[01:15:50] yeah you let her you can let her continue on where we pass on that's not good and ends up in a
[01:15:55] bad way so so a little bit of credit there but to give a little push back on Sam if you are just
[01:16:05] straight up a jerk about it well guess what we haven't done what we just talked about which is I haven't
[01:16:10] built a little bridge and connected and said you know and so now all she's gonna do is you
[01:16:16] got fat and then now we have an anger situation now they might listen anything that you're gonna say
[01:16:21] and now we might ruin a relationship based on the fact that we went too hardcore now to Sam's point
[01:16:27] if you don't ever indicate any kind of truth then you just let a person continue on a path that
[01:16:32] bad for them and is bad for their in this case they're wait well and that's not good either
[01:16:37] but the key component if you have tact and you build a relationship because basically I think I
[01:16:43] had this conversation with LaFa little while ago you know when you're dealing with someone
[01:16:47] when you're dealing with a team you're either forwarding and improving the relationship or you
[01:16:54] know you could be neutral or you're making it go backwards what we want to be doing is improving
[01:17:01] the relationship at a minimum we want to remain neutral and every other aspect of going backwards
[01:17:07] in a relationship is bad so if we're business partners and we have a we have a discussion about
[01:17:12] something I want the result of that discussion to be that our relationship improved yeah
[01:17:17] at a minimum I want to be neutral and worst case we've actually gone backwards because that's not
[01:17:22] not good so now we start talking about your spouse we want that relationship to improve we don't
[01:17:28] want it to go backwards and neutral is a minimum so when we when we get asked the question do I look
[01:17:35] fat and the answer is absolutely yeah that's going to be that's not going to lead to that's not
[01:17:42] going to lead to the it's not going to lead to your spouse respecting and listening to what you're
[01:17:49] saying it's going to lead to your spouse saying oh you're a jerk you don't know how hard it is
[01:17:54] for me you're not part of my team you're on a different team and therefore since we're on different
[01:18:00] teams I don't need to listen anything that you say yeah so there's better way to go about it
[01:18:05] tact then that's called tact yeah and I have these talks with my brother Jade from time to time
[01:18:14] and so an example is like if you like if you're a character you know you guys like you use a word
[01:18:21] wrong or say a word pronounced a word wrong like the guy who's so quick to always correct you
[01:18:26] in front of people doesn't matter whatever you know you're a character usually those
[01:18:32] characters people those character people are they're right you know and then they're telling
[01:18:37] the truth it's true it's correct you know so what they're saying is they're correct and they're
[01:18:41] lonely because not like you're saying yes because look no tact right so that what they're saying
[01:18:48] is correct what they're doing is not correct like you shouldn't do that and that's like essentially
[01:18:53] what tact is you know it's not like you're saying hey did I say that right and you're like hey you
[01:18:58] know you didn't say that right and it's different too to pull someone aside and say hey man hey
[01:19:03] just just want to let you know you mispronounce this word right now yeah there's and I I don't
[01:19:09] like the fact that I mispronounce words and I do it on this podcast on a fairly regular basis
[01:19:14] and occasionally someone will hit me up and say hey you mispronounce this word that word
[01:19:19] someone sent me a either an email or something the other day that was like you mispronounce words
[01:19:26] this would not be that hard to fix you should pay attention or whatever something that was pretty
[01:19:30] pretty pretty straightforward right and I was like yeah you know that's a bummer because the thing is
[01:19:41] I don't like mispronouncing words and yet the corrective measures
[01:19:46] for not mispronouncing words is for instance if we're going and I'll listen I'm saying something
[01:19:55] wrong and I'm like hold on let me go back let me interrupt one of my thought pattern let me
[01:20:00] interrupt what I'm saying to try and figure out if I pronounce this thing right or wrong
[01:20:06] I lean towards it's better to just flow and get corrected later so I apologize for my
[01:20:14] mispronounced words yeah my bus I should do a better job like that guy who emailed me that I'm sorry
[01:20:22] the last one is unselfishness unselfishness is the study devoidance of caring for or providing for
[01:20:32] one's own comfort or advantage at the expense of others anytime that you as the leader
[01:20:42] are getting the good deal while your people are getting shafted they notice it and they don't
[01:20:49] like it they don't like it at all so and it's weird because the military does that that's the way
[01:20:56] the military operates the officers get paid more money the officers live in officers quarters
[01:21:04] the e-dogs are down in the village of the ship and the hot nasty and just that's the way it is so
[01:21:12] there's a little bit of that but there's there's a saying in the military rank has its privileges
[01:21:21] and it's sort of a stoppy thing to say in my opinion but anyways I guess the point I was going to
[01:21:27] make is when I had when I had officers that were that I really had a lot of respect for they would
[01:21:32] always downplay that and never rub it in your face basically yeah because there is a separation hey
[01:21:37] these guys are in a leadership position they have more responsibility and therefore they're
[01:21:42] getting paid more and they're getting treated a little bit elevated okay but when someone would rub
[01:21:47] that in your face boy that just doesn't make you mad right what's the expression one you know
[01:21:54] the ear boss or what someone who outranks you it's not necessarily it's not in the military I
[01:21:59] don't think but it's like you know this it's like I have a few more letters in my title or something
[01:22:04] like that or a few more oh no expression like my title has a few more letters in it but
[01:22:08] however it's something like that oh yeah my boss told me that one time yeah like straight up like
[01:22:14] I was this is back in the club dude I think I told you this told you that straight up yeah well here's
[01:22:19] the thing so in in our club there was an area you couldn't go in if you had a dress code in this
[01:22:25] area it was like a dumb dress code too by the way but and we all knew it everyone knew it that it was
[01:22:30] kind of dumb it's like you couldn't wear jeans yeah like jeans what about origin jeans it's
[01:22:38] a way before origin jeans unless you could wear jeans so whatever so one day I was it was like I
[01:22:43] wasn't working and I was wearing jeans all my friends were not wearing jeans there were there so
[01:22:47] I was like it's like kind of go right and then my boss was working and he said hey like you can't
[01:22:52] be in here with jeans on someone like all right dang okay you know in front of everybody but
[01:22:57] cool man alright so I left and then it was like a week later he was awesome deal that just the
[01:23:02] roles were reversed oh yeah he's up there jeans full on like doing it and I was jokingly I said hey
[01:23:10] you can't be here with jeans you know and that's what he told me he said I have a few more letters in my
[01:23:16] title damn he's the manager so he met in the track level for him to go up or down well yeah I
[01:23:24] put it this way it wouldn't went down if it wasn't at zero already yeah I wouldn't
[01:23:28] it done yeah don't do that beyond selfish and the other thing is when you do
[01:23:34] on selfish things like the people notice it and if you're doing them because hey if they also
[01:23:39] notice this if you're doing something on selfish because you want credit for it that doesn't work either
[01:23:46] oh yeah it's like if you're like oh yeah you're doing something because you want that outcome
[01:23:53] if you're you when you do something for your troops you should do it because you care about your
[01:23:57] troops yeah not because you're trying to build up a good image yeah good image with your troops
[01:24:03] sick to know man you guys have been busing your ass for me and I'm gonna handle this thing over here
[01:24:09] so you guys can go get some time off go yeah it's not it's not hey if I do this thing for those
[01:24:13] guys they'll they'll increase they'll like me more yeah yeah yeah and you can tell one guys do that
[01:24:19] two men so I've every week until no I people don't think people think no one notices yeah no
[01:24:25] yes it's fracked they noticed that more than the good deed you did yeah what okay what about this
[01:24:30] though what about if they you know how like this is a commoner where you make a donation right
[01:24:36] to to whatever charity or cause or whatever right and you should we just and you know and they
[01:24:41] celebrate we just made this donation to this charity or whatever like how about that because that's
[01:24:45] what you're it's kind of doing you're publicizing yeah no you're well okay I get that people do that
[01:24:51] and then you take that and you compare that to someone that says oh well like they investigate
[01:24:58] some politician and then they go this politicians are you know a horrible person and investigate
[01:25:04] him and they find out that he's donated millions of dollars to all these different charities but
[01:25:08] never said a word about it you're a spec for that person goes as opposed to someone that's
[01:25:13] donated millions of dollars and he's like hey let's do another photo shoot of me donating
[01:25:17] right there's the big giant no four by six check yeah hundred thousand dollars thing on it yeah
[01:25:25] yeah that's at the front of their website yeah so at the end of the day it's more about like
[01:25:31] okay so what message was sort of sent and received like is the message is the front running message
[01:25:37] the fact that I am so generous that I donate and I do these things or is the message that oh my gosh
[01:25:43] it's so good now that this you know charity whatever gets the help that they want kind of thing
[01:25:48] you know what's you know what people underestimate all the time people underestimate
[01:25:55] how well other people can see what's going on they say I get personally that I see people
[01:26:01] I say man do you really think that anybody you're fooling anyone and it usually happens
[01:26:10] it usually happens with people that are well they're obviously they're smart but they're they're
[01:26:16] so they think they're so smart right they think they're so smart I always think to myself man
[01:26:23] do you really think that anyone is do you think you're getting this over on any one so we we make
[01:26:29] these mistakes like this is a classic example when you do something cool but you're just doing it
[01:26:33] because you want that credit everybody sees that everybody sees it goes oh yeah you just do
[01:26:38] that's trying to look cool because you know why they know that because two days ago you screwed
[01:26:42] them and now you're trying to be all cool yeah but people make that mistake all the time I'm
[01:26:47] a hypersensitive to what other people are like how they perceive I realize that any facade that I put
[01:26:55] up is just it's anyone basically anyone can see sure you might fall a couple people but people just look
[01:27:02] at you go oh that's garbage oh yeah I don't believe you but it's in and I'm agreeing with you
[01:27:08] but I'm not agreeing with you in being like yeah and I don't do that but to me everyone does that
[01:27:14] literally everyone does it and literally everyone is not like less aware how you say like it's like
[01:27:21] under what you say you under yes so to me everyone and that's why the one that's why the
[01:27:27] important thing is when you're doing things do them from the place of honesty right do them
[01:27:35] from you know I'll say things like I'm trying to think of a good example where I say hey you
[01:27:39] got to do this and then I'll say you got to do this now say but you got to actually mean well just
[01:27:46] take it I mean the real easy example is like take ownership of something right I'll say hey you got to take
[01:27:51] ownership of that but I'm not saying hey take ownership of that because then everyone will think that
[01:27:56] you're a marker and then no one will be mad at you no that's not why you're doing it you're taking
[01:28:01] ownership because you have to actually believe that you're the one that's in charge of that and that
[01:28:05] you were truly responsible for what had happened when somebody asked me if if I would have taken
[01:28:10] extreme ownership if I would have gotten fired with that have changed my view it's like no my view
[01:28:15] was and is that as the leader I'm responsible for everything that happens yeah that's truly responsible
[01:28:21] not not hey oh I read in a book I read in the the FM 10 tack 22 that that I'm supposed to be
[01:28:30] responsible so I'm gonna raise my hand and say I'm responsible no you have to truly believe it in
[01:28:35] that thing yeah and and what's good is if you can do that exercise with yourself and say to yourself
[01:28:43] wait a second why am I saying this do I truly believe what I'm saying yeah and if you don't
[01:28:47] you have to say wait a second this isn't that's not right it's not right to do that you need to
[01:28:52] actually believe what you're saying yeah and then after you realize that you know you're not right
[01:28:59] you look up and realize that everyone else is already there everyone else already sees that yeah
[01:29:04] you don't believe here's another one when guys when a girl breaks up with a guy and the guy is
[01:29:08] all heartbroken right and they'll say you know I don't know what to do and I'll say look you have to
[01:29:15] not you have to not care and so what they think I'm saying is act like they don't care
[01:29:23] but I'm not saying that I'm saying you have to not care you have to actually not carry
[01:29:28] you have to actually say hey this person was not who I thought they were and I don't care that
[01:29:34] they're gone and I'm gonna move on if you say that that's your best possible outcome if all
[01:29:39] you're doing is acting that way and it's still driving you crazy goes back to what we just said
[01:29:44] if you're just acting that way guess what the female in the situation absolutely knows that
[01:29:48] you're just trying to act that way yeah they have the I mean human beings have a certain level
[01:29:54] of perception of of the way other people's emotions are like you can perceive it unconsciously they
[01:30:01] perceive it unconsciously or consciously you know it's like you're like I have a dog my dog can
[01:30:06] kind of know what I'm thinking and that's a damn dog with a brain like a size of a walnut or
[01:30:13] whatever how big a big a dog's brain is right not big my dog can't speak English right
[01:30:20] but my dog if I come home and I I go I act a certain way like he knows it and so when you act
[01:30:29] like when you're acting like you don't care that girl can see that you care and it doesn't
[01:30:34] work you have to actually not care when you are trying to do something good for your troops because
[01:30:40] you want to win score points with them they know that when you're trying to prop up so so this
[01:30:48] okay this is a good example when I said hey I'm trying to build a relationship with a boss that's
[01:30:54] why I'm going to act this way right that's different because that boss is going to say oh he's
[01:30:59] just trying to butter me up it's like no actually oh boss you want to done that way I believe
[01:31:06] that's the best thing we can do is try and get it done that way so here I go I'm going to make it happen
[01:31:10] it's not hey I'm going to skate around and sneak around and try and fool you no I'm going to
[01:31:15] believe in what I'm doing yeah I'm going to believe that you have some higher intention that you're
[01:31:20] focused on and that's cool with me you have to take it to the next level man you have to take it to
[01:31:28] the next level you got to believe what you're doing you got to believe it yeah and when you don't
[01:31:34] people know every assume that everyone knows it yeah but my brother we're talking with me
[01:31:38] Greg Macontire and my brother yes Greg I think for whatever Greg Trin and we're basically
[01:31:44] conce like telling my brother hey like come back to duty he's been out of the game for a while
[01:31:50] and then so he's like he's making up this total story oh god and hard here it
[01:31:55] and you know he's good at those debate you know and he's talking about this and this and like being
[01:32:01] Greg Trin or like not really saying that much stuff he didn't be like two of his excuses
[01:32:06] um that you know since he's like sort out of shape right or since he's actually
[01:32:11] going to wait to get back and shape right for him that's what we're asking but when you ask it
[01:32:15] direct like that it sounds dumb you know so he's like no what's no it's not that it's you know so
[01:32:20] if I'm like so exhausted you know I like I like training and I like kind of conversating with
[01:32:26] it with everybody at the end and stuff like that so if I'm like so exhausted from training not only
[01:32:32] is that experience kind of diminished then I'm too exhausted to have like a good conversation go
[01:32:38] D. He he said it way more like could you laugh at him I would bro if you I wanted him to yes
[01:32:44] I was laughing you realize you're talking about this right yes okay and then you will be good
[01:32:48] thing well okay so me and it was right as Greg was sort of leaving right so I'm looking at Greg's
[01:32:53] face and Greg has that look on his face that we all kind of get but Greg really gets it on his face
[01:32:58] kind of like just wait all right bro whatever you say kind of thing um totally not believing right
[01:33:04] and I'm there man is I'm like can you hear yourself like that's not even a believable thing you know
[01:33:10] can you be so exhausted that you can't talk afterwards can you do that especially I'm sure you can
[01:33:15] if you're ran a foot I don't know hundred and then he could yeah yeah no he he can't put it
[01:33:22] that way and we all know that so anyway so so Greg sort of leaves and leaves it at that and I'm
[01:33:26] sitting there like kind of looking at him and I was like but just like all right that's that's not true
[01:33:32] you know we I know why you're not gonna go it's not a big deal you know we have friends that do
[01:33:37] that same thing oh yeah sure I'll be back but I just don't want to go tomorrow because of this and
[01:33:42] that and this and we're like those aren't even like applicable excuses you know and he was like
[01:33:48] he's like you're right you're right you're right hundred percent right hundred you totally admitted it
[01:33:52] you know so we see back on the mat because he was not here today no you know
[01:33:57] eight y'all's get back on the mat he got good quick to that and that's kind of part of the
[01:34:02] the whole picture you know it's like you're based on what do you think that he will he
[01:34:10] learned learned anything from you just by being your twin brother no no no it's kind of similar
[01:34:17] way to me although his game is very different from yours yeah and maybe from like
[01:34:22] like he's like has an analytical mind you know so if like if I do like if he asks oh here's another
[01:34:30] thing yes kind of indirectly from being my twin brother so medium can communicate like spot on
[01:34:35] that's it's like we won't run into miss understanding very often so it's a few years
[01:34:40] long about not training you did so well that was being without weakness you're talking
[01:34:44] about like he underestimating under people's reception now was hit that which he has obviously
[01:34:49] like we all do but yeah so if he has a question or he hears me talking about something
[01:34:55] you do to wise he picks up on it I think in that way real quick and you know he's a
[01:35:00] fun you not explain things really well to him because you have 40 years of common language
[01:35:07] and experience to say hey remember when I do this or hey remember and football and that or hey
[01:35:11] remember when whatever you got all this stuff you can communicate through the tone right you know
[01:35:16] right yeah so yeah so I'd say there's that you know but yeah he did he got the
[01:35:22] quick the interesting thing about underestimating the way that everyone else thinks
[01:35:27] is when you do that first of all it's there they know and if you actually just live your life
[01:35:35] in a way that you're not trying to put up fronts your life is going to be better yeah
[01:35:39] and if you live your life thinking that guess what at a minimum people are going to someone's
[01:35:44] going to know that this is a front if you do that it's kind of like when I told the
[01:35:49] I've told a bunch of soldiers officers that they had a psycho path in their pontoon
[01:35:56] and like every if you're if you got 40 and I went through this with Jordan where I asked
[01:36:01] him I said hey is I said if you have 40 people in a military in a pontoon in an infantry
[01:36:06] pontoon is one of them a sadist and he's like absolutely absolutely and and then I he said one
[01:36:13] and a hundred is good but in the military you've already eliminated a bunch of you know
[01:36:17] weak or yeah you've eliminated all non say it because there's no there's no one that's like
[01:36:23] not at least has some tendency to to be able to kill people right those people are in the
[01:36:28] pontoon so you've eliminated a bunch of people that have zero chance of being a say this they're
[01:36:32] not in there so one out of 40's not bad so if you treat your pontoon as if you have a say
[01:36:39] to stand there then you will eliminate that problem from getting out of hand so that's what you do so
[01:36:44] if you treat your life as if people will see through the lies in the fronts that you're trying
[01:36:49] to put up for them you'll do better in life and you'll have a better pontoon and you'll have a better
[01:36:55] life yeah that's good enough you push yeah all right leadership techniques it is important to
[01:37:04] note that in small units the leader can influence and direct his men through close personal
[01:37:08] contact whereas in large units he must rely in great measure upon his staff and subordinate
[01:37:12] commanders to a system in making his leadership effective the larger the unit the more complex
[01:37:18] the problems of leadership but the greater the greater become the means available to the commander
[01:37:26] to assist him in the exercise of his leadership so as you grow problems get more complex but you
[01:37:31] end up with you have more people you have more tools the larger unit commander must consider carefully
[01:37:36] the leadership aspect of all basic policies which he prescribes your tolerance okay this is what's
[01:37:41] interesting so we work with companies that grow really quickly especially nowadays in the
[01:37:47] start-up world in the tech world and this is where they have a tough time transitioning because when
[01:37:53] you're in a room you're not in an office and you got six people in there guess what your leadership
[01:38:00] is really easy right you're talking you know him you communicate with him you guess to 20 people okay
[01:38:06] it's a little tricky but still you're all in the room you're meeting you're seeing each other every
[01:38:09] day 30 40 I guess what we're still all pretty much in a room everyone's having lunch where still
[01:38:15] a unit all of a sudden kicks out 200 200 300 and this is where if you don't insert good
[01:38:24] decentralized command good leadership tactics in there that's where these tech companies we're
[01:38:30] and it's not just tech companies any growing company loses it they lose it because they haven't
[01:38:35] put the command structure in place so that the vision of the commander and the vision of the
[01:38:40] leadership gets distilled all the way down through the chain of command and now you have people
[01:38:45] doing things that they shouldn't be doing and and and and and I don't necessarily mean they're
[01:38:50] doing something illegal I'm saying they're doing things that don't support the strategic goals of the company
[01:38:54] and it's a problem but as those companies grow what they don't realize is just like this
[01:39:02] book says you have more tools that you can put into place you've got it you've got to
[01:39:08] communications department inside your company whose job is internal communications so you could
[01:39:14] be making what you could be making videos and explain to people what's going on and given an update
[01:39:18] you can you can do all those things you have that capability you have VTCs right you got video calls
[01:39:25] you can make you you've got subordinate leadership that can go out there and get in the field
[01:39:29] and make things known so there's a way to overcome these problems if you address them if you don't
[01:39:35] address them and you can you think if you think you can keep leading a 2000 person organization
[01:39:41] as if you were leading 20 people you're going to have a major issues and it's not going to work
[01:39:45] it's not going to work back to the book over a period of time the leader will develop techniques of
[01:39:52] his own which will be better suited to his own personality in which he himself will be able to
[01:39:57] employ effectively so yeah you're all going to get your own little leadership techniques and what's
[01:40:03] I'm telling you where I'm really lucky is I've worked with so many different leaders that I just
[01:40:07] don't know my techniques I say hey you know what's a good thing to do here my buddy bill you
[01:40:12] stabbing issue with us and you could you know so that's kind of nice now here are some
[01:40:20] leadership techniques these are leadership techniques that apply back to these principles
[01:40:28] these are applicable to all leaders okay so when it comes to knowing your job principle
[01:40:31] I want to know your job seek a well-rounded military education through attendance at service schools
[01:40:36] and through regular independent reading research and study so how do you know your job you study
[01:40:44] another one keep abreast of the latest techniques in the field of communication or
[01:40:47] facilitate control of your unit and disseminate information three seek out and foster association
[01:40:54] with capable leaders observe and study their actions and application of leadership techniques
[01:41:00] for broaden your field of knowledge through association with officers and men of other armed
[01:41:04] services five seek the opportunity to apply knowledge through exercise a command real leadership is
[01:41:13] acquired only through constant practice six avoid over specialization into narrow field seven
[01:41:19] keep abreast of current military developments eight familiarize yourself with capabilities and
[01:41:24] limitations of all elements of your command by study and through frequent visits to support
[01:41:28] it's so that's cool know your job and I'll tell you what one thing that's impressive is I get
[01:41:33] to work with a lot of leaders and some of these leaders come up through their industry and man
[01:41:38] they are knowledgeable it's impressive it's impressive but where the shortfall is they're they're
[01:41:47] super knowledgeable about their field but they don't have the leadership knowledge so
[01:41:55] that's what's beneficial about things like this podcast like extreme worship like that
[01:41:59] got to me leadership like putting this information where people can actually read it and understand
[01:42:03] it they can study because they know their job they know their technical field you know that's
[01:42:07] another thing with EF overwatch right now is like we're bringing in people that don't
[01:42:13] necessarily have the technical skill inside of a field but they have the leadership experience and
[01:42:20] it's a lot easier to teach someone a technical skill that it is to teach the leadership because
[01:42:24] to get leadership the only way you get better leadership is leadership.
[01:42:29] So we're very it's been very successful so far and now we're starting to see employers
[01:42:35] that say they were a little you know your hesitant because you think how do you know anything
[01:42:39] about whatever I do know if how can someone that's not from this field lead in this field
[01:42:45] give the person an overview of what the what the field is and then they take their 22 years
[01:42:51] 24 years 26 years of real leadership experience and they apply it.
[01:42:56] It's kind of like taking human resource department a little bit in a small way.
[01:43:01] What about it right like where?
[01:43:02] What about HR HR yes they go you know you have this department that they don't know anything about
[01:43:08] software or nothing like that they don't know about you know and that's big that's a big deal
[01:43:13] when people are working together you know kind of thing.
[01:43:15] Yeah good good analogy.
[01:43:19] Okay here's some things some techniques for principle to know yourself and seek self improvement.
[01:43:24] One analyze yourself objectively to determine the strong and weak points of your character.
[01:43:31] You could make that into a little drill right actually look actually go down that list of
[01:43:36] characteristics and say which where you at.
[01:43:40] Two recognize your weak points and make an after overcome them three solicit when appropriate
[01:43:44] the candidate opinions of others as to how you can make the most of your desirable
[01:43:48] qualities and eliminate your undesirable ones. Be careful because when you ask that question
[01:43:53] if you ask it honestly you're going to get some answers you don't want to hear.
[01:43:55] What your weak points?
[01:43:57] Yeah all right and I want to hear about those weak points.
[01:43:59] No not even from themselves.
[01:44:01] No from themselves and it's it's so rare that someone truly wants to hear what they screw
[01:44:08] up. It just doesn't hardly exist.
[01:44:11] So so what that means is everyone knows that and since everyone knows that they are not
[01:44:17] going to give you an honest feedback.
[01:44:20] So when you say hey how did I do in that last task they go oh man you did good they're lying.
[01:44:25] They're not even being tactful they're lying they're telling a lot they're telling a lie to you.
[01:44:30] Because if they want to be tactful they get to be tactful and say hey you know what I know
[01:44:35] was a tough project and you pulled it off which was commendable but there was some
[01:44:41] definite errors for improvement and you know what luckily I kept a list. Let's go through it.
[01:44:46] Boom.
[01:44:47] Next profit by studying the causes for past success or failure of other leaders past and
[01:44:55] present. Develop a genuine interest in people acquire the human touch practice the golden
[01:45:02] rule master the art of good writing and speaking.
[01:45:07] How do you do that? Right and speak and read and listen.
[01:45:13] And last one cultivate causal relations with members of other arms and services and with civilians.
[01:45:21] Cool. That's how you get to know yourself.
[01:45:25] Some things some techniques for knowing you're knowing your men principle free.
[01:45:28] Know your men and look out for their welfare. Number one see the members of your command and let them see you.
[01:45:35] Stay locked up in the ivory tower. Be friendly and approachable.
[01:45:40] Yeah. Important. Develop an intimate knowledge and understanding of your
[01:45:47] support. It's through personal contact and available records in small commands. It is imperative
[01:45:51] not only that the leader know the name and address of his support. But also that he's familiar
[01:45:56] with their characteristics. Cool. Know your people. Literally know your people.
[01:46:01] Interest yourself in living conditions of the members of your command including their
[01:46:05] family environment food clothing ability. Make ample provision for any give personal and visible
[01:46:11] attention to the various personal services particularly those concerned with the personal
[01:46:15] problems of individuals. Provide for the spiritual welfare of your command by supporting
[01:46:20] religious activities protect the health of your command by active supervision of hygiene and sanitation.
[01:46:26] Support actively a safety program determine the mental attitude of members of your command
[01:46:30] by frequent informal visits and by using fully all available sources of information.
[01:46:38] And minister justice impartially to all without fear or favor.
[01:46:44] When punishment is necessary the commander should be fair, consistent, and impersonal
[01:46:50] punishment, private with dignity and with human understanding. Never award a degrading punishment
[01:46:58] avoid punishing a group for the faults of the individual. Always make the individual feel that
[01:47:05] the punishment is temporary and that improvement is expected. I think when he says expected or
[01:47:12] when they say expected I don't think they're talking about like I expect you do better. It's more
[01:47:17] like hey man. I know you can do better. That's what they're talking about. And it's an interesting
[01:47:23] one that avoid punishing a group for the fault of the individual because the military is famous for
[01:47:26] doing that especially in like boot camps and areas where we're going to keep doing these until we
[01:47:32] can all do them in unison, whatever jumping jacks. But beyond those scenarios that's not always the
[01:47:38] best call to make. Yeah because that's like it's one of those people they do that too. Real
[01:47:45] obvious. Like if you mess up everyone else does the bell, the bear crawls you know you and you
[01:47:50] stand and watch because that's like a psychological punishment to the guy more than the team. Yeah.
[01:47:57] So it's like it's like a different approach but yeah man I get it for that very reason by the way.
[01:48:01] It works in the boot camp environment or the team training environment where you're trying to
[01:48:09] create this overall cohesion by making everyone rely on each other and be able to count on each other.
[01:48:19] Yeah as if to say in a demonstrable way like when you mess up this affects the team and put the
[01:48:26] peer pressure on everyone to step up their game. Right? If we don't make this time, if everyone doesn't
[01:48:32] make this time then we're all going to get punished. Okay so we don't want that on our backs.
[01:48:36] Right. But when you get into a business situation you start punishing people for the group failure
[01:48:41] that's that's not as effective in building in fact what they can do sometimes it starts
[01:48:47] ripping things apart. So you're going to be careful with that one. Don't hate it, make a. Yeah.
[01:48:53] Next, ensure fair and equitable distribution of privileges such as passes, leaves and rotation
[01:48:58] and encourage educational development by providing educational opportunities for members of your command.
[01:49:04] I often ask groups this leaders in companies I'll say who here had someone that truly
[01:49:14] took a vested interest in you and helped you move up the ranks through the chain of command
[01:49:21] in your industry and everyone will raise their hand just about 99% of people will raise their hand.
[01:49:27] And I'll say how good did that feel one to ten to have someone that was completely invested in
[01:49:33] helping you? Who's a nine or above everyone raise their hand? Imagine how good that feels when you
[01:49:40] do that for someone else. Because it's really easy to forget that someone helped you. It's real
[01:49:47] easy to forget that you got hoisted up to your position of power by other people that were willing
[01:49:53] to sacrifice their time and their energy to improve your life. So when you get the opportunity to
[01:49:58] improve someone else's life do it. Next, techniques for keeping your men informed,
[01:50:06] explain to your principal support and it's why any particular task must be accomplished
[01:50:14] and how you propose to it. So, importance of understanding why.
[01:50:17] Assure yourself by frequent inspections and visits that support and it's our transmitting
[01:50:22] necessary information to the men. So you just can't expect it. You got to inspect it.
[01:50:29] Keep your principal support and it's informed of plans for future operations subject
[01:50:33] only to security restrictions to disseminate information concerning the capabilities of our
[01:50:37] weapons compared to those of an active or potential enemy where an enemy has an initial advantage,
[01:50:42] show how this can be overcome. Be sure that troops are informed with the capabilities and limitations
[01:50:48] of supporting units, arms and services, be alert to detect the spread of false rumors,
[01:50:55] stop rumors by replacing them with the truth. Build confidence in a
[01:51:02] free to core by exploiting all information concerning successes of the command.
[01:51:06] That's a big one. There's a lot of times businesses companies, people, they do things,
[01:51:11] things go well and they don't tell anybody about it and it gets lost. Whereas if you want to build
[01:51:15] morale and you want to get momentum, you've got to tell everyone hey, we're out here and we're crushing
[01:51:19] it. Principal, five, how to set the example. Number one, be it all times physically fit,
[01:51:29] mentally alert, well groomed and correctly dressed. There you go. That's how you set the example.
[01:51:38] Two, master your emotions. The commander who is subject to intemperate bursts of anger or
[01:51:46] periods of depression will have difficulty in gaining and holding respect and loyalty of its
[01:51:51] subordinates. Maintain an optimistic outlook. The will to win is infectious. The leader
[01:52:01] fosters it by capitalizing on his units capabilities and successes not on his limitations
[01:52:06] or failures. Maintain an air of outward calmness. The more difficult the situation, the more important
[01:52:13] this becomes. So when things start going sideways, you got to stay calm. Conduct yourself so that
[01:52:20] your personal habits are not open to censure. Course behavior and vulgarity are the marks of an
[01:52:26] essentially weakened unstable character. These together with a failure to be punctual and a tendency
[01:52:33] towards selfishness and self-indulgence in luxuries not available to the command in general
[01:52:39] are inevitably resented by all ranks. So that's what we were just talking about. But yeah,
[01:52:44] man, you got to hold yourself to a little higher standard. Maybe even a lot higher standard. Because
[01:52:50] they're watching you. Cooperate in spirit as well as in fact, this is what I just talked about
[01:52:58] and what we just talked about. It's not just hey, I'm pretending to do this because it's going to
[01:53:03] make things easier for me and it's I truly am doing this. Cooperation must work in two directions.
[01:53:09] It arises from a whole hearted desire by all members to further the effective operations of the team.
[01:53:18] Exercise initiative and promote this spirit of initiative in your subordinates.
[01:53:24] We can speak loosely loyal to those below you as well as those above you. Support those
[01:53:29] under you as long as the individuals concerned have been discharging their duties competently.
[01:53:35] The commander who seeks however to protect and incompetent subordinate from correction by a higher
[01:53:41] commander is being disloyal himself. Loyalty is a prime trait of leadership and demands
[01:53:47] unqualified support of the policies of the superior officers whether the individual concerned
[01:53:53] personally favors them or not. That's the whole conversation we just had about loyalty.
[01:53:57] Avoid the development of a click of favorites.
[01:54:04] Walland is difficult to avoid. I like this one because they readily admit this is interesting.
[01:54:09] So avoid the development of a click of favorites. But then they kind of throw this on there.
[01:54:13] Walland is difficult to avoid being partial to subordinates who have rendered loyal and superior
[01:54:18] service over a period of time that's a temptation to show partiality should be vigorously resisted.
[01:54:24] So they're saying like, isn't it hard? Do you have somebody on your team that's just doing great things?
[01:54:28] Yes, natural. I always had a hard time with that. Yeah, it makes sense.
[01:54:33] I would be over about it. But if you were doing good, you're going to get some some bannies from
[01:54:38] that. Yeah. Be morally courageous. The commander who fails to stand by his principles where the
[01:54:46] welfare of his commanders concerned or who attempts to avoid responsibility for mistakes of his
[01:54:52] command will fail to gain or hold respect of his associates or subordinates.
[01:54:58] And the last one, share danger and hardship. A leader who has elements of his command subjected
[01:55:05] to danger or to hardship of any kind should visit them as often as possible to demonstrate without
[01:55:10] ostentation that his willingness to assume his share of the difficulties.
[01:55:15] So those are some techniques for that. Principle six, how do we ensure that the task is
[01:55:23] understood supervising the complex here are some techniques for that. Through study and practice
[01:55:27] develop the ability to think clearly to issue a clear concise positive order.
[01:55:33] Is it strange that I ended up using the word simple clear concise and they use the words,
[01:55:38] I guess it's not that weird, but it's it's fun to see.
[01:55:41] Hmm. To encourage subordinates to seek immediate clarification about any point in your orders or
[01:55:48] directions that they do not understand perfectly. So that's something that so many people fail to do.
[01:55:54] Is everyone just keeps their mouth shut? No, I don't know any questions.
[01:55:57] So funny like these. This one really is seem so obvious. Like oh yeah, you're not clear. Like
[01:56:04] oh what are you doing if you're not clear? It's this big mystery. What to do?
[01:56:07] Everyone knows even if you're a kid that you know like oh I didn't understand that like what do you mean?
[01:56:11] What do you mean? Why? Why are you in a kid's always asked why? Why? Why? Same thing. So it seems
[01:56:16] super obvious, but yeah when you're in there you want to keep your mouth shut. There's all these different
[01:56:22] human. Yeah, you don't want to look stupid. You don't want to open you know you don't want to be that guy.
[01:56:30] Question your subordinates and assistance to determine if there's any doubt on misunderstanding to the
[01:56:36] task so this is something that we always say. How do you know people understand? You ask them and
[01:56:41] you just don't ask them do you understand? You ask them to explain it back to you.
[01:56:45] Make every means available to your subordinates to assist them in accomplishing their mission.
[01:56:52] Principle seven train your men as a team ensure by inspections and training tests that your
[01:56:56] command is being trained in accordance with the training programs and doctrine prescribed by higher authority
[01:57:02] make sure the best available facilities for team training are provided. Ensure that all
[01:57:07] training is purposeful. Ensure that each element of the command is acquainted with the capabilities
[01:57:12] and limitations of all other elements thereby developing mutual trust and understanding.
[01:57:19] Ensure each subordinate leader understands the mechanics of tactical control for his own
[01:57:24] national honor command predicate team training on modern realistic conditions.
[01:57:32] Officer and enlisted man knows the functions of each other officer and enlisted man with whom
[01:57:38] he abitually operates. Ensure that each of these no one understand each other their traits,
[01:57:43] peculiarities, strengths and weaknesses. So often in companies this is not happening in businesses.
[01:57:48] It happens pretty well in the military, but in businesses you have departments they have no idea
[01:57:54] what another department does, no idea how they do their job, no idea what their job even entails.
[01:58:01] Lafin I used to make team make teams brief what their department did and when we get them in
[01:58:08] there in the room you'd see people had no idea what their teams were doing. They'd be odd and
[01:58:13] you guys did that. Hello guys, we do that for nine years. Demand the highest standard of discipline
[01:58:22] and teamwork in all training. We support that. Seas opportunity to train with other units both combat
[01:58:29] and service. Principal eight makes sound and timely to the decisions. This first one here,
[01:58:35] this is techniques again. Develop a logical and orderly thought process by constant practice
[01:58:43] in making objective estimates of the situation. Making an estimate is not restricted to the military
[01:58:48] to employ it is employed in every day life of all persons. So how do you make decisions?
[01:58:54] How do you do that? And then you come up with kind of a process that you flow through in your brain
[01:59:02] after add that to the protocol book. How to make decisions. And so far as time and occasion
[01:59:08] permit plan for every contingency that can reasonably be for scene. Consider the advice and suggestions
[01:59:16] of your subordinates before making your decisions. Of course, announced decisions in time to allow
[01:59:21] subordinates to make necessary plans. Boom. Principal nine is seek responsibility and develop
[01:59:28] a sense of responsibility among the subordinates. So this one says, learn the duties and
[01:59:33] responsibility of your immediate supervisor. I actually think you learn your immediate supervisor
[01:59:38] and his boss. You want at least know what's going on. Seek diversified assignments which will
[01:59:44] give you responsibility and command experience. People always want to stay and do keep doing what
[01:59:48] they're good at. They want to venture out into the different world. Take advantage of any
[01:59:54] opportunity which offers increased responsibility. Do that. Oh, this is a task that needs to be
[01:59:59] done. Someone needs to run it. I got it. I'm on it. Perform every task larger small to the best of
[02:00:07] your ability. And this goes back to whatever a few podcasts go we were talking about. How you do
[02:00:15] anything is how you do everything. And I gave some slack on that one. But these guys got no slack at all.
[02:00:22] Perform every task larger small to the best of your ability. Your reward will consist of increased
[02:00:28] opportunity to demonstrate your fitness to perform bigger and more important tasks. What does that
[02:00:34] mean? The better you do, the more work you're going to get. That's what it means.
[02:00:40] Oh, tell your subordinates what to do, not how to do it. Hold them responsible for the results,
[02:00:48] delegate and supervise but do not intervene except when urgently necessary. Avoid
[02:00:53] you surfing the prerogatives of your subordinates. This is actually such a concise, clear,
[02:01:03] rule. Tell your subordinates what to do, not how to do it. Hold them responsible for the results,
[02:01:10] delegate and supervise but do not intervene except when urgently necessary. Avoid you surfing
[02:01:18] the prerogatives of your subordinates. That is really good advice for anyone in a leadership position.
[02:01:24] If you could follow that advice right there your world is going to be so much better.
[02:01:28] Provide all personnel with frequent opportunities to perform duties of the next higher
[02:01:33] echelon. Yes. To you, Bruser, we made all the junior officers be ground force commanders before
[02:01:39] everyone oversees. Got no experience and then they went overseas and did it. Be quick to recognize
[02:01:45] accomplishments of your subordinates when they demonstrate initiative and resourcefulness,
[02:01:48] correct errors in the use of judgment and initiative in such a way as to encourage the individual.
[02:01:54] Avoid public criticism or condemnation. Be liberal, however, and openly giving praise for which
[02:02:01] is deserved. Give unstintingly help. Give unstintingly of help and advice when you are
[02:02:10] requested by those under your command. That one is pretty obvious. Ensure that your personnel are
[02:02:15] assigned positions commensurate with demonstrated or potential ability. That's important.
[02:02:21] Got someone that's got some potential? Put them in a good spot. Be prompt and fair in
[02:02:27] backing subordinates to the limit until convinced otherwise have faith in each subordinate.
[02:02:35] I think you got to take a little time to make sure you build that up. You don't dive in with
[02:02:41] complete faith. Give a little task first. Demonstrate to your command that you are ready and
[02:02:47] willing to accept responsibility. Yes. Ownership. Principle 10. Techniques on how to employ
[02:02:58] your command in accordance with its capabilities. Number one, no understand and apply the principles
[02:03:05] of war. And those principles of war are different than what we're talking about right now.
[02:03:11] The principles of war that they're talking about are objective, offense, mass, economy,
[02:03:17] force, maneuver, unity of command, security, surprise and simplicity. Those are the
[02:03:25] principles of war that they're talking about. You've got to know those. So that means in
[02:03:30] your company, you've got to understand the principles that you're operating in. Keep yourself
[02:03:36] informed as to the relative operational effectiveness of various elements of your command.
[02:03:43] Be sure the tasks assigned are reasonably possible of accomplishment,
[02:03:48] analyze any task assigned. If it means you're disposable, if it means that you're disposable
[02:03:52] up here inadequate of informed inform your immediate commander in request additional means.
[02:03:56] Yeah, it's not like, oh, I'll get anything done, boss. I can do anything. No, actually, I'm going
[02:04:02] to need some more support over here. I need some more people, money, resources, whatever.
[02:04:07] Make every effort to equalize tasks proportionally over appropriate periods of time
[02:04:12] among the several elements of your command. Don't just lay down one group. If you got one
[02:04:20] group that's so much stronger than the other group, moves and people around. So you get some equality
[02:04:26] there. And here's the last principle, techniques. Take responsibility for your actions, principle 11.
[02:04:36] Extreme ownership. Remember that you are responsible for all your command does or fails to do
[02:04:41] except justified criticism at here to what you think is right and have courage of your convictions.
[02:04:52] So those are some heavy hitters. What this book does now and I'm not going to do it is it
[02:05:02] actually breaks down how what different leadership techniques you can use at every level.
[02:05:09] So it talks about and you know what? I haven't said this yet. This book is free. This is online. You
[02:05:16] can Google 1951 Leadership FM 10.22. What is that? Uh, like a PDF? Yeah, that's like a PDF.
[02:05:26] And so you can you can look it up and you can figure out where you are. It talks about
[02:05:31] technique useful to non-commissioned officers. It talks about techniques for
[02:05:36] uh, regimental and lower unit commanders. It talks about commanders of divisions
[02:05:44] and higher units and it goes through what kind of techniques you can use in each one of these positions.
[02:05:49] And they're all solid information, solid information. And points out good, not just what the rules
[02:05:58] are, but the techniques that are used to to kind of make them happen. And so solid bunch of
[02:06:09] information there that again, you can easily get this book as a pretty short read. I've read a
[02:06:14] bunch of it right now. I mean, I actually kind of went crazy with my red with my red pen just circling
[02:06:21] everything and saying, hey, read this too. But there's a ton of it in here. But I'm going to skip
[02:06:30] back to, um, let's skip that information, look it up, go read it. It's powerful stuff. And I'm going
[02:06:35] to kind of just jump ahead to this last little closing part that I wanted to cover, which is talking
[02:06:40] about how to train. And it just talks about a few things stress realism. Because we have to make
[02:06:48] training realistic that's what we have to do. It's what I did when I was in the SEAL teams. It's what
[02:06:54] you should do in whatever kind of organization you're in. If you're in a business, you should
[02:06:59] simulate, make your training as close to real as you possibly can. Another thing is require repeated
[02:07:08] drills in the execution of simple tactical maneuvers. What does that mean? Repetition counts.
[02:07:13] You have to repeat things over and over again if you want to get good at them. Another important
[02:07:21] training tips stress the importance of each leader, so placing himself and his headquarters
[02:07:27] that he can most readily coordinate all efforts of his command and of the elements that may be
[02:07:32] supporting it. Where you're located is important. Where you position yourself is important. And so
[02:07:40] you've got to recognize that that's going to change depending on the situation. You've got to learn
[02:07:44] how to address that and how to pick the right spot to be in. And the last one is last couple
[02:07:53] are stress the importance of exchange of information by all appropriate means. So we've got to communicate
[02:08:00] and the last one is have a well planned critique immediately after each field exercise. And that
[02:08:12] again wraps up this very, very powerful summation, very simple, very straightforward.
[02:08:22] I feel like I actually could have talked about each one of these points
[02:08:26] and gone over examples that because each one of them is so important. So I don't know, maybe we'll
[02:08:36] do it again. Or they'll come up again. But that's Jeff. And then just that closing point on having
[02:08:44] it well planned critique after every field exercise. What does that actually mean? What that means is
[02:08:49] always be learning. It means always be learning. And almost every one of these principles I
[02:09:00] recognized I have heard before. I've definitely read it before. We've covered them here before. But
[02:09:06] I'm still trying to learn. I'm trying to still try to relearn even the same lessons.
[02:09:11] After years of me looking at this stuff, which I guess is me just kind of following the principles
[02:09:21] themselves, which is no your job, no yourself, and see improvements. That's what I'm trying to do.
[02:09:24] And I think that's pretty much what anyone that's listening to this is trying to do.
[02:09:32] So I mean I guess echo speaking of rule number two and speaking of us seeking to constantly improve
[02:09:39] ourselves. What do you know about things that can help us improve our situation?
[02:09:49] Support what we're trying to do in our self improvement journey.
[02:09:55] Journey. Path, path, big time. And actually you can support this podcast. If you want to
[02:10:02] do while you support your own journey down the path of discipline and keep in mind this path
[02:10:13] that we are on also brings along others even if they're not like on the path with you.
[02:10:20] Your results of being on the path improve them as well. I found that out directly. How many
[02:10:27] capacities? Let's say in a sense that's one of those statements that you make where you're
[02:10:33] just wanting a prompt so you can tell a long story. That's what it's out of.
[02:10:37] You already said how do you know how to use the book?
[02:10:42] Not in. In a family household, in a group setting or whatever, things can get stressful.
[02:10:49] I'm not saying they're stressful every single day every moment but they can get stressful.
[02:10:54] You know like any, you know about stressful situations. I must say a little bit.
[02:10:59] So when everyone's panicking or whatever, stress out or whatever. You get one guy who jumps in there
[02:11:10] the situation. Not panicking. Not overtly stressed out and he can sort of manage not only himself
[02:11:19] but his tiny environment. It's contagious. Other people will get that and they start doing that as well.
[02:11:25] Whether it be in the immediate situation or just in general. We just covered this as part of the book.
[02:11:29] Oh yeah. Big time. How that leads first of all the leader can come from any rank
[02:11:34] and then when they step in that leadership and the way that they act will spread throughout.
[02:11:40] It's deep. Oh yeah. So you're confirming big time and that goes for a big time.
[02:11:49] So if you're getting in shape, the people around you will sort of notice. If you're like
[02:11:56] happier doing things more, make getting more done around you. Taking responsibility for things.
[02:12:04] You're taking out the trash every other night, man. Whenever it fills up.
[02:12:08] I don't know when it depends on big your your trash is like, yes, but if you're taking it out
[02:12:13] when it's full, you don't let it overflow anymore. People notice that. I'm just saying. And
[02:12:21] slowly by slowly, especially if you're happier, you know, if you're treating them better.
[02:12:25] All this stuff, they'll start doing it too. Same thing with extreme ownership. You know,
[02:12:29] I like to, you know, if you come at a problem, like, hey, that was my fault. It most of the time.
[02:12:35] Eventually, if not immediately, they'll say, well, you know what, it's kind of, it's my fault. Yeah.
[02:12:39] Same, same exact thing. So that's why you should be on the path and stay on the path.
[02:12:45] Because you're not just helping yourself. You're helping everyone around you. So you are.
[02:12:50] One of those things that you're doing on top of taking out the trash when it needs to be taken out
[02:12:55] is due to. No. Here's that's it. It's kind of, due to one of these ones where people might not
[02:13:01] write, especially if you're okay, your husband, you want to do jiu-jitsu now. But wait, we have a family
[02:13:06] of six or more, whatever, or less, I don't know. And you have responsibilities in there. Now you
[02:13:12] want to add this quote unquote extra curricular activity to these tasks. That's what you're telling.
[02:13:18] Right? That's the situation, right? But like I said, when you get the benefits of
[02:13:23] jiu-jitsu, you come home. You slowly become a different person. A better person, a better person.
[02:13:28] Yeah. Right? Better person in the household is a better situation. So for everyone in the household.
[02:13:34] Everybody and the neighbors. And the neighborhood. Your whole street, your old town.
[02:13:40] The whole world is better for you. Jiu-jitsu. Your old, yes. There it is. And when you do jiu-jitsu,
[02:13:45] you will need a key and a rash card. At least one, I think. Yeah. What are the best keys in the
[02:13:51] whole wide world? They are origin keys. Origin keys by far. They are made in America. 100%
[02:13:56] it. Sometimes people actually know about the keys, but people still ask. You know, some people
[02:14:01] will be like, they don't like, they start training and they don't like it. Don't like, oh,
[02:14:05] would you just say, yeah. Yeah. It's some people realize immediately like they get submitted.
[02:14:12] They're like, you know, they'll pull their post up on Twitter. And they'll say,
[02:14:16] I did my first jiu-jitsu class yesterday. I got submitted and beat up and I got submitted by a
[02:14:22] 15 year old girl. It's the best thing ever, right? Some people say that. Yeah. Because I think we are
[02:14:28] doing a good job of setting the expectations of the fact that it's gonna, you're gonna get
[02:14:34] humbled. They won. You're gonna get humbled. I actually don't care who you are. Yeah.
[02:14:40] You're gonna get humbled. Because even if you're a D1 wrestler, you're gonna come in there.
[02:14:44] And it's gonna be humbling because you're not gonna be able to quite do what you think you're
[02:14:47] gonna do. Yeah. I mean, you'll be able to take someone down. You'll be able to, you'll be up.
[02:14:52] But you won't be able to make them tap. You won't really know how to. I mean, if I'm a
[02:14:55] person, it doesn't know anything. But if you're going against a blue belt or a purple belt,
[02:15:00] gonna be hard for you. Yeah. So my first, it was like, it was technically, I guess, my first or
[02:15:06] second day in a class setting. It wasn't with Dean. You know, I tried like two other gyms
[02:15:11] before I joined with Dean. And I went and they were like, yeah, you know, I literally
[02:15:15] won't do you two classes. I learned, I don't even remember what it was. So they're like,
[02:15:19] hey, roll, now it's time to roll. So I'm going, I'm going into that way smaller than me. And it was
[02:15:24] like within, he had like a month, I think a month experience. I'm you, I'm way bigger than
[02:15:29] this guy. And he was thinking, like, you're example, he didn't tap me out, but I literally couldn't do
[02:15:36] anything. Yeah. Gas and I'm so tired. I'm huge. I'm like, 225 solid. Like solid. Like, I can't get
[02:15:41] no. He's in, he's 150. Here's a, it's about 150. Yes. And so here's the thing. He's like a month or two
[02:15:48] in. It's a complete white belt too. But I'm like new guy. But I'm lame. We're at like literally,
[02:15:53] I could pick this guy up over my head. Literally couldn't do nothing. Couldn't even pass his guard.
[02:15:58] And I knew what a guard pad. I knew like you have to pass this guy's there. And he was telling
[02:16:02] and he told me afterwards, he was like, hey, like you're, you're expanding to my channel to you all
[02:16:06] this stuff. Whatever. And I'm thinking of my head, but I don't, I don't know that. I mean,
[02:16:09] obviously because I'm tired. But it just goes to show how much you just don't know about when you're
[02:16:14] going. Even though you're, you're, you're big and strong. Whatever. So yes, you will get a whole
[02:16:19] whole. Yeah. You, so expect that part of it. And then instead of when you do get beat up,
[02:16:25] when you get choke, when you get arm lock, instead of getting mad and thinking, I'm never going to
[02:16:30] do this again. Think to yourself, I'm going to do this a lot until I can get good enough that some
[02:16:37] unknown person can really impose their will on me as a human being. I didn't like that feeling,
[02:16:45] man. Yeah. So yeah, it just goes to show like that. It matters what response you have to it. That's
[02:16:51] like the what really matters. So yeah, we are all going to get beat up. We're all going to get
[02:16:56] submitted multiple, when I say multiple, probably thousands. Yeah. By people were smaller.
[02:17:02] Yeah. What do you think you want to start? You get submitted 10 times a day. When you start?
[02:17:06] Yeah. Yeah. Oh yeah. So you're getting submitted 50 times a week if you're training five days a week.
[02:17:11] Yeah. But you're so small and you're bigger than you smell and whoever all different people. So yeah.
[02:17:15] So how are you going to respond? Are you going to respond by saying, I never want that experience
[02:17:18] every again, ever again, or are you just wanting to be with, I want that skill. Whatever this guy
[02:17:24] obviously has or the all these people obviously have got it from this place by the way. I know that too.
[02:17:30] Yeah. Am I going to choose to be there? I don't know. I don't want that skill. There's not
[02:17:34] about it somewhere. You don't have to go to like some other country. Yeah. And generally in America,
[02:17:41] you can just go down, you can Google Maps and you can find nine digits of schools. Well,
[02:17:47] maybe not. Maybe around in San Diego, you can. So the California can. If you're in another part of
[02:17:52] the country, you can probably find two. You try two options where you are most likely. Now you could be
[02:17:57] way out in the middle, nowhere. Cool. Get some mats, get some friends, get one of those online programs,
[02:18:03] start learning, go to YouTube, YouTube's free to start listening what they're saying and trying it on
[02:18:09] your buddies. And you'll start to learn GJT-Z. Yeah. Boom. On the path. GJT-Z. Get your get an origin
[02:18:17] G, 100% made in America. Yeah. Good G. Here's the engineered for GJT-Z. Yeah. Quality. Great train was
[02:18:24] commenting on his new origin G. The new one. He was like, oh, it's like a pearl. It's like a thing. And
[02:18:30] he doesn't like geek out over that kind of stuff. Typically, but he was in for good reason. Yeah.
[02:18:35] And you know, you kind of gloss over like Made in America. That's actually a really big deal.
[02:18:40] It's actually bringing back an industry that had left that had left this country and bringing it back
[02:18:50] where we are. We've hired the people that got left behind. They're not left behind anymore.
[02:18:57] They're up there. They're making the best GEEZ in the world in a small town in New England.
[02:19:03] Bringing back that economy. Yeah. So when you support origin, you're actually supporting
[02:19:11] much more than GJT-Z. You're supporting much more than this podcast. You're actually supporting
[02:19:16] America and you're supporting the working people of America. That's what you're doing. So we're
[02:19:22] going to try and continue to drive down this path to continue to grow this company where we can bring
[02:19:30] significant amount of jobs back to America, employ more people and let other people grow and
[02:19:41] pay and provide for their families. That's what the goal is. And it feels great to go up to Farmington
[02:19:45] and be there in the factory and see what is being made by this tradition of craftsmanship.
[02:19:56] And you know, right now we're bringing on the shoes, the boots, and the same thing. We got people
[02:20:02] that haven't been able to work in this industry for 12 years since they shut down the factories up there
[02:20:09] and outsourced the jobs and sent the machines overseas. That's what actually happened.
[02:20:14] So it actually happened. And the people talk about the corporate greed, right? Hey, it's going
[02:20:24] to cost me whatever it's going to cost me. I can save a little bit of money by shipping these things
[02:20:29] overseas. We'll let all these people go and that's fine. I don't care. Well, we do care. We do care.
[02:20:37] And we recognize that the strength of America comes from our economy and the strength of our
[02:20:41] economy comes from the ability of our of the working people in America to have a job and work hard
[02:20:47] and make the best product in the world. That's what we're doing. Yeah, and it's man and over all
[02:20:52] the repeat has that cool little series where it'll sort of it'll show the little inside. Yeah.
[02:20:56] So you say, yeah, we have this problem. So I'm I think I'm going to call this guy and this guy
[02:21:01] he's talking about is the old school expert who, you know, like he doesn't do it anymore.
[02:21:06] But he has all this knowledge. He comes in boom, boom, solving problems. And then and it shows
[02:21:13] the interaction between like the workers and Pete and like everybody, right? So it's not like this,
[02:21:17] I mean, no offense to China, but it's not like your typical go to China and you turn it
[02:21:22] burn these things, you know, no defects or whatever. Yeah, that video series is called origin
[02:21:27] HD. What's the name of the of the YouTube channels? I think it's origin B JJ. So if you go to that,
[02:21:33] you can get behind the scenes on what's being made on who's making it on on the kind of effort
[02:21:41] that the team up in origin is putting in to make the quality that's up there. It's it's awesome to
[02:21:48] watch. It's awesome to watch. So that they got a bunch of clothes up there too. Rashcards,
[02:21:55] you know, t-shirts and all that. You can get from origin. We also, we yeah. And now we have genes
[02:22:00] which are going to be live like this week. We have, we're their introduction. We hired a bunch of
[02:22:07] people, a bunch of more people. So don't just run out and buy a pair of jeans made in China by
[02:22:14] somebody in a sweatshop, buy a pair of jeans here that are made in America from the dirt
[02:22:21] until they're on your legs, all that made in America. So yeah, you can get that. We also have
[02:22:29] supplements, supplements that I basically wanted to make exactly how I wanted them. That's basically
[02:22:39] what they are. Yeah. Basically my saying, hey, this is what has always worked for me. These things
[02:22:44] put them together, combine them and make them. And also, by the way, if it's something that I'm
[02:22:52] going to eat, make it taste good. And here's how we're going to do it. We're going to sweeten it
[02:22:55] with monk fruit, which is a fruit, obviously. It's not a camp. There's not some, you know,
[02:23:05] group of whatever scientists in a laboratory trying to create something that tastes good through
[02:23:11] a bunch of cancer, causing crap. No, they're taking a fruit, putting it in there. That's why
[02:23:15] milk tastes so good. Is there any better way to get additional needed protein? No, there is
[02:23:22] not no better way. Now my house where I live, where my family, now it's who can make the best
[02:23:31] milkshake. Right? I mean, my wife comes in the other day. She's holding the cob. And she's like,
[02:23:37] she let's be tasting. I'm like, what in God's name? It's so good. It's so good. I don't even want to eat
[02:23:44] anything else. It was coconut milk, vanilla gorilla, three ice cubes, one chunk like a quarter of a banana.
[02:23:56] That thing tasted like a gourmet dessert, but donkiness. If you, um, this is a little added thing.
[02:24:04] I put some, um, like MCT oil and coconut oil, you know, like just a little bit, not like too much
[02:24:11] with ever. And it's weird. So it, it more adds to the texture than it does the taste, but that's like a
[02:24:17] little sneaky way to make your taste more quality than the other competitors. It's ridiculous.
[02:24:22] That could be good for you. It is. Because you feel like you're just eight in ice cream.
[02:24:27] Shake. Right? But you didn't. You got high quality protein. You got probiotics.
[02:24:34] Oh, it's getting good. It's a sneaky thing you do with your kids. By the way, you can use where you
[02:24:38] could milk to whatever, whatever. By the way, strawberry, strawberry milk for adults is coming.
[02:24:44] It should be out pretty soon. And I've tried it. It's, it's, it's absolutely completely and
[02:24:49] utterly ridiculous how to get a taste. And that can be good for you. Yeah. It's totally ridiculous.
[02:24:54] Did they send you a sample of it? Of the, of the strawberry, adult milk? Oh, no, no, no, no.
[02:25:01] It's, I can't believe it. Okay. So anyways, there you go. So what you do with your kids is,
[02:25:06] you know how you got to threaten them with punishment. Everyone's, I'll say, hey, no dessert.
[02:25:10] Or you want to use it as an incentive. Like, hey, if you can clean up your room within the next,
[02:25:14] you know, three minutes or whatever, you can have a mole. I'll give you, yeah, yeah. So I don't even say
[02:25:18] malt, I'll just go. I'll make you a, unless they already know. Unless they're in the know,
[02:25:22] then, but you say, I'll give you a special dessert or treat or whatever. You make it with the
[02:25:28] mole. You put the little bit of empty deal. You know, you make it taste all gourmet the way you did.
[02:25:34] So boom, they clean up their room within three minutes, by the way,
[02:25:37] whenever time parameters you, you give them. They get the mole all thinking they won. They won the game.
[02:25:43] Yeah, yeah. You know, I did that little task. You told me, you know, I, and I, and I saved the, the deal.
[02:25:48] Right, got my dessert. You won the game. And that's the, they won.
[02:25:53] We are the whole team one. I like it. Don't forget about joint warfare in
[02:25:58] Criollo recently, Lave Babin, forgot about joint warfare. And he got off the mat. He, he,
[02:26:05] texted me, he's like, bro, I didn't take joint warfare for like three days for whatever he's
[02:26:09] traveling or wants something. And he's like, I got done rolling in us. Man, why am I so jacked up? Oh,
[02:26:15] yeah, because I haven't taken any joint warfare. Got back on the joint warfare back on the good
[02:26:20] to go train. Yeah. Yeah, and which was ironic. And I addressed this on that, uh, there was a post
[02:26:25] that he made is out. Yeah, my post. Yeah. So I mean, we posted it because he was like, I can't even
[02:26:31] believe this. It's ridiculous. Yeah. The, the difference that you notice. Yeah. And like I said,
[02:26:37] the irony there is early on. It wasn't with joint warfare. It was with Criollo. I forgot my
[02:26:42] in New York. Oh, yeah, New York. And Jenna comes in, you know, actually I told Lave, I told a bunch of
[02:26:48] people, but you know, don't want to really want to give me any. Yeah, I didn't. I didn't want to give
[02:26:52] you any. Yeah, because I travel with like the number of that I need for that time period that
[02:26:57] I'm going for. I can't spare any. Can't really run it around with like extra acrylic oils. You
[02:27:05] say you're not going to be my water in the field. I carried it. I'm drinking it unless you're going to die.
[02:27:11] Yeah, I'll say really, yeah, exactly. Well, in high school, when I when me and J with when my brother
[02:27:16] me and my brother would lift, so we were real like discipline with the post workout meal, right? And it
[02:27:23] wouldn't, I wouldn't say it would be measured out, but there'd be enough. You know, you'd have to have
[02:27:27] a specific amount for the post workout meal. So if we were to go buy sushi or go buy something like
[02:27:32] good and maybe, you know, my brother or I would ask, oh, let me get something. Let me taste it. We'd
[02:27:37] say I can't spare the nutrients. So I can't give you any. I want to share, but I can't
[02:27:42] throw the nutrients from my workout, whatever. No, that's what you do. That's what you do with your
[02:27:48] crew. Well, unless that after, you know, a few hours of failure of getting more krill oil,
[02:27:55] Jenna Lee, Bavin came through with the krill oil. Nice. Yeah. So it's kind of new. We're back in the game.
[02:28:02] Oh, huge time. So it's just ironic that life, Jenna's there, husband. Yeah, went through the same deal.
[02:28:08] Yeah. Yeah. You got to be careful with that. You don't want to run. Don't fall off. Yeah. And you do
[02:28:13] mention where your kid, Mark, if you got kids get them where your kid, Mark, don't even play around.
[02:28:19] Don't even play around. What are you going to give him? Hershey's syrup to make chocolate milk.
[02:28:25] You need to give him Nestle's quick to make chocolate milk. Why don't you just give them a big
[02:28:31] glass of type 2 diabetes? Because that's what you're doing. Yeah. Or you can say, hey, here's something
[02:28:39] that tastes better and is incredibly good for you. Yes. So there you go. Where your kid milk. You can
[02:28:46] get some of that. Well, you look a little bit. Also, you want to represent while on the path.
[02:28:51] Chocolate is still called jocco store. Obviously. Original. Yeah. We all know that. I think by now.
[02:28:58] Actually, maybe not everybody unless jocco store.com. That's where you can get your
[02:29:04] discipline equals freedom. T-shirts, rash guards. No one out by the way. We have a new rash guard
[02:29:11] out. Stand by to get some. Stand by to get some jiu-jitsu. Or what is your doing? Wait,
[02:29:17] stand by to get the new rash guard or that's what the rash guard says. But.
[02:29:20] Good. All right. Cool. T-shirts, rash guards, hats, tracers, and things.
[02:29:26] Thee these light weight hoodies for those of you that live in the lower 40s.
[02:29:30] Yeah. Great. No, Brady Lanter texted me. He was like,
[02:29:33] Brady today. He's in Michigan. He's in Michigan. He said today is light weight hoody day.
[02:29:39] Yeah. Well, he also did a good job of posting that little thing of him out in the freezing cold.
[02:29:44] And he was like, we just need to light weight up here. Because he's hard to go. Oh, you're
[02:29:48] teasing. Oh, okay. He's hard to work. He's hard to work. Well, right. If you're not as hard
[02:29:51] work as Brady in those circumstances, we have heavy weight hoodies too. So boom, light and heavy,
[02:29:56] whatever you need, whatever you like. A lot of cool stuff on there. If you like something,
[02:30:00] good. So don't forget about jocquay T, which I am currently drinking. And the reason I'm drinking
[02:30:05] it is not only because it tastes good, but also because I like having an 8,000 pound deadlift
[02:30:11] actually 100% guaranteed. If you drink a jocquay T and you can't deadlift 8,000 pounds,
[02:30:19] you can send me the empty can and I'll send you the nickel for the can. Yeah. So that's
[02:30:26] don't forget to subscribe to the podcast because if you don't then go ahead and you just don't
[02:30:32] know what you're thinking. You know what? You don't subscribe. Yeah, if you don't subscribe, then you're
[02:30:35] not subscribed, which isn't good. Kind of like a case when you launch occasionally,
[02:30:40] but rare occasion, we launch something randomly for like some kind of an event, some kind of
[02:30:45] a situation for launch the rent. So if you're just expecting, oh, it's Wednesday, I know when I'm
[02:30:49] going to get the podcast that you jump on there. There's another one waiting for you. Yeah. So
[02:30:54] if you want to get those, know those, subscribe to the podcast, whatever you subscribe to the podcast.
[02:30:59] And don't forget about the Warrior Kid podcast, which is awesome. For some reason, I always clear
[02:31:06] myself hot to say that Warrior Kid stuff is awesome. I think it's because I'm saying it as like a
[02:31:14] dad. You know what I mean? Yes, I do know. I'm not saying it directed at myself. Yeah, look, I don't mean
[02:31:19] like, hey, I'm great at the Warrior Kid podcast. I'm not saying that. I'm saying it as a dad. You can
[02:31:27] get your kid to listen to Warrior Kid podcast. It will benefit them greatly in trying to figure out
[02:31:33] the ways of the world and how to live in this crazy world that we have. And also, there's a Warrior
[02:31:41] Kid that makes soap in Central California. Well, I guess it's Southern California, but anyways, Irish
[02:31:48] Oaks Ranch.com, young Aiden, runner-to-business, at least 13 years old, pretty soon he's not going
[02:31:54] to be a kid anymore. But in the meantime, you get some of the soap so you can stay clean. And we got
[02:32:02] a YouTube video channel. Was that what it's called? Yeah, yes, you video channel. Yeah, right as opposed
[02:32:11] to YouTube what channel? Audio channel. Well, anyways, on that video channel on YouTube, which the
[02:32:19] video channel is called, Jocco podcast. That's the video channel, right? Yes, sir. Yes, sir. So if you go to
[02:32:26] that, you can watch a bunch of videos that Echo Charles made. And you can watch this podcast. You can
[02:32:32] see what Echo Charles looks like. He looks like not like what he sounds evidently. And also, he
[02:32:39] makes, he's, what do you, what do you experiment with? Sure. Yeah, he makes videos with his own personal skills.
[02:32:52] Right? Yeah, such an eloquent interest thing. Well, the thing is I feel like a lot of times when you
[02:32:58] make videos, you're not, you're experimenting. You know what? You're not that is, it's not like,
[02:33:04] it's not like I'm saying, hey, make this video and here's the effect that we want. Right, right, right.
[02:33:09] You're just over there just making videos. And they just, with your own vision. Yeah. Well,
[02:33:16] the goal, okay, so the goal, well, the goal for the whole YouTube thing is sure the video version,
[02:33:22] you know, watch the podcast, which you know, man, that's I dig it now. A lot of people do that. I dig it.
[02:33:28] And then the excerpts we have excerpts on there too. If you don't watch the whole thing, you know,
[02:33:32] you can watch, you can share those. Yeah. Cool. But yeah, and then sure, I'll take an excerpts
[02:33:38] essentially, taking excerpts and kind of video wise has some fun with it. You know, add some
[02:33:44] facts and music and stuff. And yes, very much experimental. What we should make a video of what my life
[02:33:51] would be like if everything was reflective of how your videos are. I thought about that. Yeah,
[02:33:58] that was going to funny. Because like actually that warpath video, that's essentially kind of
[02:34:02] trying to do the thing is like if you're on the warpath and here's all the things that you're doing.
[02:34:06] So it showed like, you know, the little video clips of me when I or not of me that I got of you
[02:34:11] just doing your stuff. You do. And writing and stuff. So you put it on the warpath. That's kind of what
[02:34:17] it represents a little bit. It's just a path of destruction in a constructive way. Check. So you can
[02:34:25] do that. You can also get psychological warfare, which is a little bunch of tracks to help you over
[02:34:31] come moments of weakness, which apparently are quite effective because I've had many people
[02:34:36] explained to me that they utilize them regularly. Yeah. So psychological warfare, iTunes, Google Play,
[02:34:43] MP3, platforms of all kinds. You can you can check that out. Also check out Flipside
[02:34:50] Canvas, which is Dakota Meyer. If you have a listen of episode 115 of this podcast, it's one of
[02:34:57] the most popular podcasts, one of the heaviest podcasts, one of the most impactful podcasts.
[02:35:06] And there's a lot of impactful podcasts. So I guess that's saying a lot. But Dakota's making,
[02:35:13] what are they, what was he making? One of those things called canvases or art, right? Hang yeah,
[02:35:19] pieces. Yeah. And they, he's got a bunch of different ones, but he actually has made some kind of
[02:35:25] based on this podcast. He's got one that says discipline equals freedom. He's got one that says good.
[02:35:32] He's got one that says time is running out. And he's got one that says, yeah, to have grit.

[02:39:21] where the warrior kid marks mission and book three coming out. It'll be available for preorder very
[02:39:26] soon. I'll let everyone know. It's called Where There's a Will. And then the discipline goes
[02:39:31] freedom field manual. Just how to get after it mentally and physically and emotionally.
[02:39:42] Feeling. Yeah. The fact that that book is continuing. I'm continuing to get the best
[02:39:51] feedback on that book. So it was cool now people are posting the pictures of it. Okay. This page
[02:39:56] got me through today. Yeah. So there you go. Just when you go freedom field manual get that one.
[02:40:02] It's not on audible. It's on iTunes Amazon music Google play on it's on MP3 platforms. Don't
[02:40:09] forget about extreme ownership. The first book I wrote with my brother, Dave Babin, about what we
[02:40:14] learned in combat and how you can apply it to your business and your world and your life. And
[02:40:18] then we followed that up with the dichotomy of leadership at which we are now getting multiple reports
[02:40:24] from the battlefield that the dichotomy of leadership is a little bit better. Some people think.
[02:40:30] I am. I kind of felt that way. But you know extreme ownership has the core.
[02:40:38] Like it's always going to have. It's always going to be the bigger brother. Yeah. That's the O.G.
[02:40:42] But you never know, man. dichotomy sometimes that that other kid, right? Yeah. Sometimes the other kid
[02:40:48] has the has a little bit. You can learn lessons. That's exactly what happened with dichotomy.
[02:40:53] We learned lessons after we wrote extreme ownership and said, you know, what the most,
[02:40:55] you know, with the hardest thing for people to do is balance the dichotomy of leadership. That was
[02:41:00] chapter 12. In extreme ownership, then it became a whole book. Yeah. So it was kind of like
[02:41:05] rambo, right? You know, so rambo when people say, who do you think you're rambo?
[02:41:11] They're talking about rambo first blood part two. Right. So dichotomy is kind of like rambo where
[02:41:17] like people are like, oh, I love the dichotomy love, but but the people who know know that first blood
[02:41:22] is the real movie is the real O.G. One that rambo's not better. Rambo's not rambo gets a lot of glory.
[02:41:29] They get the praise and it's awesome. Well, one thing that I guarantee you is that dichotomy leadership
[02:41:34] is not jaws to which no one talks about jaws to no one cares about jaws. Oh,
[02:41:41] just as one is epic. Yeah. So the dichotomy leadership is epic and it's own right. It's like
[02:41:50] any can stand on its own. But it's still going to be still on the shadow. It seems to be coming
[02:41:53] out from the shadow. I guess that's what I'm saying. Just like rambo. Okay. Well, that's good.
[02:41:59] Don't forget about echelon front. That is our leadership consultancy is we solve problems
[02:42:05] through leadership. So it's me, Dave Babin, JP, and El Dave Burke, Flynn, Cockran, Mike's

[02:42:30] you want to crush them. So if you want to do that reach out echelonfront.com. Don't forget about the

[02:43:50] across your organization. So it's online, but it's not just watching videos. It's yes, there's
[02:43:56] videos, but it's also interactive where you get put in the leadership scenarios. And then you have to
[02:44:02] figure out what to do. And if you choose the wrong scenario, you're going to lead your company or your
[02:44:07] platoon into a bad situation. So check it out. EF online.com. And I already talked about this.
[02:44:15] HeF overwatch. This is the company that we have now where we're taking special operations and combat
[02:44:22] aviation people, leaders and putting them into companies. So that the companies can utilize the
[02:44:31] leadership skills of these experienced combat leaders to help their company lead to victory.
[02:44:40] And as I mentioned earlier, you don't. I recommend you don't hire just based on experience.
[02:44:46] Recommend you hire people based on the talent that they have. Especially the leadership capable
[02:44:54] to the staff. And if you want to stay in the game with us, Echo and I are actually on the
[02:45:04] interwebs. We are on Twitter. We are on Instagram. And we are on the FISH book. Echo is Echo Charles

[02:45:19] paramedics, EMTs, correctional officers, border patrols, all first responders, including the
[02:45:25] dispatchers. I spent some time as I said with the police out in North Carolina recently. And
[02:45:32] what a tough job. And what a great bunch of people out there putting it all in the line to protect
[02:45:39] us here at home. And of course, to our military men and women, like the one that I open up this
[02:45:49] podcast with Fred Garland, Bragg, Jr. First Lieutenant, US Army, killed an action Vietnam on July
[02:45:58] 12th, 1967. But a hero, a leader and an example to all of us that regardless of the odds you are facing,
[02:46:15] you can stand up and you can fight. And to everyone else out there, you can do the same thing.
[02:46:23] Every day stand up to whatever challenges you face and get after it.
[02:46:32] And until next time, this is Echo and Jockaw.
[02:46:36] Thank you for your pe Fine.
